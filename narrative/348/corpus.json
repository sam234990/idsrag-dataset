{"ori_id":"518b93650f7e95289f694bccd0fd9f2da1d12369","title":"The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle","context":"The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle\n The novel begins with the character of Peregrine as a young country gentleman rejected by his cruel mother, ignored by his indifferent father, and hated by his degenerate brother. After their alienation, he turns to Commodore Hawser Trunnion, who raises him. Peregrine's detailed life experience provides a scope for Smollett's satire on human cruelty, stupidity, and greed: from his upbringing, education at Oxford, and journey to France, to his jailing at the Fleet, unexpected succession to his father's fortune, and final repentance and marriage to his beloved Emilia. The novel is written as a series of adventures, with every chapter depicting a new experience. There is also a lengthy independent story within the novel called \"The Memoirs of a Lady of Quality\", written by Frances Vane, Viscountess Vane.\nPeregrine Pickle features several amusing characters, most notably Commodore Hawser Trunnion, an old seaman and misogynist who lives in a house with his former shipmates. Trunnion's lifestyle may have inspired Charles Dickens to create the character of Wemmick from Great Expectations.  Another interesting character is Peregrine's friend, Cadwallader Crabtree, an old misanthrope who amuses himself by playing ingenious jokes on naive people.\nSmollett also caricatured many of his enemies in the novel, most notably Henry Fielding and the actor David Garrick. Fitzroy Henry Lee was supposedly the model for Hawser Trunnion.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle, Volume I, by\nTobias Smollett\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

He was the son of a merchant in London, who, like Rome, from\nsmall beginnings had raised himself to the highest honours of the city,\nand acquired a plentiful fortune, though, to his infinite regret, he\ndied before it amounted to a plum, conjuring his son, as he respected\nthe last injunction of a parent, to imitate his industry, and adhere to\nhis maxims, until he should have made up the deficiency, which was a sum\nconsiderably less than fifteen thousand pounds.\n\nThis pathetic remonstrance had the desired effect upon his\nrepresentative, who spared no pains to fulfil the request of the\ndeceased: but exerted all the capacity with which nature had endowed\nhim, in a series of efforts, which, however, did not succeed; for by the\ntime he had been fifteen years in trade, he found himself five thousand\npounds worse than he was when he first took possession of his father's\neffects; a circumstance that affected him so nearly, as to detach his\ninclinations from business, and induce him to retire from the world to\nsome place where he might at leisure deplore his misfortunes, and, by\nfrugality, secure himself from want, and the apprehensions of a jail,\nwith which his imagination was incessantly haunted. He was often heard\nto express his fears of coming upon the parish; and to bless God, that,\non account of his having been so long a housekeeper, he was entitled\nto that provision. In short, his talents were not naturally active, and\nthere was a sort of inconsistency in his character; for, with all the\ndesire of amassing which any citizen could possibly entertain, he was\nencumbered by a certain indolence and sluggishness that prevailed over\nevery interested consideration, and even hindered him from profiting by\nthat singleness of apprehension, and moderation of appetites, which have\nso frequently conduced to the acquisition of immense fortunes;\nqualities which he possessed in a very remarkable degree. Nature, in all\nprobability, had mixed little or nothing inflammable in his composition;\nor, whatever seeds of excess she might have sown within him, were\neffectually stifled and destroyed by the austerity of his education.\n\nThe sallies of his youth, far from being inordinate or criminal, never\nexceeded the bounds of that decent jollity which an extraordinary pot,\non extraordinary occasions, may be supposed to have produced in a club\nof sedate book-keepers, whose imaginations were neither very warm nor\nluxuriant. Little subject to refined sensations, he was scarce ever\ndisturbed with violent emotions of any kind. The passion of love never\ninterrupted his tranquility; and if, as Mr. Creech says, after Horace,\n\n    Not to admire is all the art I know;\n    To make men happy, and to keep them so;\n\nMr. Pickle was undoubtedly possessed of that invaluable secret; at\nleast, he was never known to betray the faintest symptom of transport,\nexcept one evening at the club, where he observed, with some\ndemonstrations of vivacity, that he had dined upon a delicate loin of\nveal.\n\nNotwithstanding this appearance of phlegm, he could not help feeling his\ndisappointments in trade; and upon the failure of a certain underwriter,\nby which he lost five hundred pounds, declared his design of\nrelinquishing business, and retiring to the country. In this resolution\nhe was comforted and encouraged by his only sister, Mrs. Grizzle, who\nhad managed his family since the death of his father, and was now in\nthe thirtieth year of her maidenhood, with a fortune of five thousand\npounds, and a large stock of economy and devotion.\n\nThese qualifications, one would think, might have been the means of\nabridging the term of her celibacy, as she never expressed any aversion\nto wedlock; but, it seems, she was too delicate in her choice, to find\na mate to her inclination in the city: for I cannot suppose that she\nremained so long unsolicited; though the charms of her person were\nnot altogether enchanting, nor her manner over and above agreeable.\nExclusive of a very wan (not to call it sallow) complexion, which,\nperhaps, was the effects of her virginity and mortification, she had\na cast in her eyes that was not at all engaging; and such an extent of\nmouth, as no art or affectation could contract into any proportionable\ndimension; then her piety was rather peevish than resigned, and did\nnot in the least diminish a certain stateliness in her demeanour and\nconversation, that delighted in communicating the importance and honour\nof her family, which, by the bye, was not to be traced two generations\nback by all the power of heraldry or tradition.\n\nShe seemed to have renounced all the ideas she had acquired before her\nfather served the office of sheriff; and the eye which regulated the\ndates of all her observation, was the mayoralty of her papa. Nay, so\nsolicitous was this good lady for the support and propagation of the\nfamily name, that, suppressing every selfish motive, she actually\nprevailed upon her brother to combat with his own disposition, and\neven surmount it so far, as to declare a passion for the person whom he\nafterwards wedded, as we shall see in the sequel. Indeed, she was the\nspur that instigated him in all his extraordinary undertakings; and I\nquestion, whether he would or not have been able to disengage himself\nfrom that course of life in which he had so long mechanically moved,\nunless he had been roused and actuated by her incessant exhortations.\nLondon, she observed, was a receptacle of iniquity, where an honest,\nunsuspecting man was every day in danger of falling a sacrifice to\ncraft; where innocence was exposed to continual temptations, and virtue\neternally persecuted by malice and slander; where everything was ruled\nby caprice and corruption, and merit utterly discouraged and despised.\nThis last imputation she pronounced with such emphasis and chagrin, as\nplainly denoted how far she considered herself as an example of what she\nadvanced; and really the charge was justified by the constructions that\nwere put upon her retreat by her female friends, who, far from imputing\nit to the laudable motives that induced her, insinuated, in sarcastic\ncommendations, that she had good reason to be dissatisfied with a place\nwhere she had been so overlooked; and that it was certainly her\nwisest course to make her last effort in the country, where, in all\nprobability, her talents would be less eclipsed, and her fortune more\nattractive.\n\nBe this as it will, her admonitions, though they were powerful enough to\nconvince, would have been insufficient to overcome the languor and\nvis inertiae of her brother, had she not reinforced her arguments, by\ncalling in question the credit of two or three merchants, with whom he\nwas embarked in trade.\n\nAlarmed at these hints of intelligence, he exerted himself effectually;\nhe withdrew his money from trade, and laying it out in Bank-stock, and\nIndia-bonds, removed to a house in the country, which his father had\nbuilt near the sea-side, for the convenience of carrying on a certain\nbranch of traffic in which he had been deeply concerned.\n\nHere then Mr. Pickle fixed his habitation for life, in the\nsix-and-thirtieth year of his age; and though the pangs he felt at\nparting with his intimate companions, and quitting all his former\nconnections, were not quite so keen as to produce any dangerous disorder\nin his constitution, he did not fail to be extremely disconcerted at his\nfirst entrance into a scene of life to which he was totally a stranger.\nNot but that he met with abundance of people in the country, who, in\nconsideration of his fortune, courted his acquaintance, and breathed\nnothing but friendship and hospitality; yet, even the trouble of\nreceiving and returning these civilities was an intolerable fatigue to\na man of his habits and disposition. He therefore left the care of\nthe ceremonial to his sister, who indulged herself in all the pride of\nformality; while he himself, having made a discovery of a public-house\nin the neighbourhood, went thither every evening and enjoyed his pipe\nand can; being very well satisfied with the behaviour of the landlord,\nwhose communicative temper was a great comfort to his own taciturnity;\nfor he shunned all superfluity of speech, as much as he avoided any\nother unnecessary expense.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe is made acquainted with the Characters of Commodore Trunnion and his\nAdherents--Meets with them by Accident, and contracts an Intimacy with\nthat Commander.\n\n\nThis loquacious publican soon gave him sketches of all the characters\nin the county; and, among others, described that of his next neighbour,\nCommodore Trunnion, which was altogether singular and odd. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\ncommodore and your worship,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill in a short time be hand and\nglove, he has a power of money, and spends it like a prince--that is, in\nhis own way--for to be sure he is a little humorsome, as the saying is,\nand swears woundily; though I'll be sworn he means no more harm than a\nsucking babe. Lord help us! it will do your honour's heart good to hear\nhim tell a story, as how he lay alongside of the French, yard-arm and\nyard-arm, board and board, and of heaving grapplings, and stink-pots,\nand grapes, and round and double-headed partridges, crows and carters.\nLord have mercy upon us! he has been a great warrior in his time, and\nlost an eye and a heel in the service. Then he does not live like any\nother Christian land-man; but keeps garrison in his house, as if he\nwere in the midst of his enemies, and makes his servants turn out in\nthe night, watch and watch as he calls it, all the year round. His\nhabitation is defended by a ditch, over which he has laid a draw-bridge,\nand planted his court-yard with patereroes continually loaded with shot,\nunder the direction of one Mr. Hatchway, who had one of his legs shot\naway while he acted as lieutenant on board the commodore's ship; and\nnow, being on half-pay, lives with him as his companion. The lieutenant\nis a very brave man, a great joker, and, as the saying is, hath got the\nlength of his commander's foot--though he has another favourite in the\nhouse called Tom Pipes, that was his boatswain's mate, and now keeps the\nservants in order. Tom is a man of few words, but an excellent hand at\na song concerning the boatswain's whistle, hustle-cap, and\nchuck-farthing--there is not such another pipe in the county--so that\nthe commodore lives very happy in his own manner; though he be sometimes\nthrown into perilous passions and quandaries, by the application of his\npoor kinsmen, whom he can't abide, because as how some of them were the\nfirst occasion of his going to sea. Then he sweats with agony at the\nsight of an attorney, just, for all the world, as some people have an\nantipathy to a cat: for it seems he was once at law, for striking one of\nhis officers, and cast in a swinging sum. He is, moreover, exceedingly\nafflicted with goblins that disturb his rest, and keep such a racket in\nhis house, that you would think (God bless us!) all the devils in hell\nhad broke loose upon him. It was no longer ago than last year about\nthis time, that he was tormented the livelong night by the mischievous\nspirits that got into his chamber, and played a thousand pranks about\nhis hammock, for there is not one bed within his walls. Well, sir,\nhe rang his bell, called up all his servants, got lights, and made\na thorough search; but the devil a goblin was to be found. He had no\nsooner turned in again, and the rest of the family gone to sleep, than\nthe foul fiends began their game anew. The commodore got up in the\ndark, drew his cutlass, and attacked them both so manfully, that in\nfive minutes everything in the apartment went to pieces, The lieutenant,\nhearing the noise, came to his assistance. Tom Pipes, being told what\nwas the matter, lighted his match, and going down to the yard, fired all\nthe patereroes as signals of distress. Well, to be sure the whole parish\nwas in a pucker: some thought the French had landed; others imagined the\ncommodore's house was beset by thieves; for my own part, I called up two\ndragoons that are quartered upon me, and they swore, with deadly oaths,\nit was a gang of smugglers engaged with a party of their regiment that\nlies in the next village; and mounting their horses like lusty fellows,\nrode up into the country as fast as their beasts could carry them. Ah,\nmaster! These are hard times, when an industrious body cannot earn his\nbread without fear of the gallows. Your worship's father (God rest his\nsoul!) was a good gentleman, and as well respected in this parish as\ne'er a he that walks upon neat's leather; and if your honour should want\na small parcel of fine tea, or a few ankers of right Nantes, I'll be\nbound you shall be furnished to your heart's content. But, as I was\nsaying, the hubbub continued till morning, when the parson being sent\nfor, conjured the spirits into the Red Sea; and the house has been\npretty quiet ever since. True it is, Mr. Hatchway makes a mock of the\nwhole affair; and told his commander, in this very blessed spot, that\nthe two goblins were no other than a couple of jackdaws which had fallen\ndown the chimney, and made a flapping with their wings up and down the\napartment. But the commodore, who is very choleric, and does not like\nto be jeered, fell into a main high passion, and stormed like a perfect\nhurricane, swearing that he knew a devil from a jackdaw as well as\ne'er a man in the three kingdoms. He owned, indeed, that the birds were\nfound, but denied that they were the occasion of the uproar. For my own\npart, master, I believe much may be said on both sides of the question;\nthough to be sure, the devil is always going about, as the saying is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis circumstantial account, extraordinary as it was, never altered one\nfeature in the countenance of Mr. Pickle, who, having heard it to an\nend, took the pipe from his mouth, saying, with a look of infinite\nsagacity and deliberation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do suppose he is of the Cornish Trunnions.\nWhat sort of a woman is his spouse?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpouse!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the other;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009codds-heart! I don't think he would marry the queen of Sheba.\nLack-a-day! sir, he won't suffer his own maids to be in the garrison,\nbut turns them into an out-house every night before the watch is set.\nBless your honour's soul, he is, as it were, a very oddish kind of a\ngentleman. Your worship would have seen him before now; for, when he\nis well, he and my good master Hatchway come hither every evening, and\ndrink a couple of cans of rumbo a piece; but he has been confined to\nhis house this fortnight by a plaguy fit of the gout, which, I'll assure\nyour worship, is a good penny out of my pocket.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt that instant, Mr. Pickle's ears were saluted with such a strange\nnoise, as even discomposed the muscles of his face, which gave immediate\nindications of alarm. This composition of notes at first resembled\nthe crying of quails, and croaking of bull-dogs; but as it approached\nnearer, he could distinguish articulate sounds pronounced with great\nviolence, in such a cadence as one would expect to hear from a human\ncreature scolding through the organs of an ass; it was neither speaking\nnor braying, but a surprising mixture of both, employed in the utterance\nof terms absolutely unintelligible to our wondering merchant, who had\njust opened his mouth to express his curiosity, when the starting up at\nthe well-known sound, cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOdd's niggers! there is the commodore with\nhis company, as sure as I live,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and with his apron began to wipe the\ndust off an elbow-chair placed at one side of the fire, and kept sacred\nfor the ease and convenience of this infirm commander. While he was thus\noccupied, a voice, still more uncouth than the former, bawled aloud,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHo! the house, a-hoy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Upon which the publican, clapping a hand to each\nside of his head with his thumbs fixed to his ears, rebellowed in the\nsame tone, which he had learned to imitate, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHilloah.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The voice again\nexclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you got any attorneys aboard?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and when the landlord\nreplied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d this man of strange expectation came in, supported by\nhis two dependents, and displayed a figure every way answerable to\nthe oddity of his character. He was in stature at least six feet high,\nthough he had contracted a habit of stooping, by living so long on\nboard; his complexion was tawny, and his aspect rendered hideous by a\nlarge scar across his nose, and a patch that covered the place of\none eye. Being seated in his chair, with great formality the landlord\ncomplimented him upon his being able to come abroad again; and having in\na whisper communicated the name of his fellow-guest, whom the commodore\nalready knew by report, went to prepare, with all imaginable despatch,\nthe first allowance of his favourite liquor, in three separate cans (for\neach was accommodated with his own portion apart), while the lieutenant\nsat down on the blind side of his commander; and Tom Pipes, knowing his\ndistance, with great modesty took his station in the rear.\n\nAfter a pause of some minutes, the conversation was begun by this\nferocious chief, who, fixing his eye upon the lieutenant with a\nsternness of countenance not to be described, addressed him in these\nwords: \u00e2\u0080\u009cD-- my eyes! Hatchway, I always took you to be a better seaman\nthan to overset our chaise in such fair weather. Blood! didn't I tell\nyou we were running bump ashore, and bid you set in the ice-brace, and\nhaul up a wind?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the other, with an arch sneer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do\nconfess as how you did give such orders, after you had run us foul of\na post, so as that the carriage lay along, and could not right\nherself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI run you foul of a post!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the commander: \u00e2\u0080\u009cd-- my\nheart! you're a pretty dog, an't you, to tell me so above-board to my\nface? Did I take charge of the chaise? Did I stand at the helm?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered Hatchway; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must confess you did not steer; but, howsomever,\nyou cunned all the way, and so, as you could not see how the land lay,\nbeing blind of your larboard eye, we were fast ashore before you knew\nanything of the matter, Pipes, who stood abaft, can testify the truth of\nwhat I say.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cD-- my limbs!\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed the commodore, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't value what\nyou or Pipes say a rope-yarn. You're a couple of mutinous--I'll say no\nmore; but you shan't run your rig upon me, d-- ye, I am the man that\nlearnt you, Jack Hatchway, to splice a rope and raise a perpendicular.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe lieutenant, who was perfectly well acquainted with the trim of his\ncaptain, did not choose to carry on the altercation any further;\nbut taking up his can, drank to the health of the stranger, who very\ncourteously returned the compliment, without, however, presuming to join\nin the conversation, which suffered a considerable pause. During this\ninterruption, Mr. Hatchway's wit displayed itself in several practical\njokes upon the commodore, with whom he knew it was dangerous to tamper\nin any other way. Being without the sphere of his vision, he securely\npilfered his tobacco, drank his rumbo, made wry faces, and, to use the\nvulgar phrase, cocked his eye at him, to the no small entertainment of\nthe spectators, Mr. Pickle himself not excepted, who gave evident tokens\nof uncommon satisfaction at the dexterity of this marine pantomime.\n\nMeanwhile, the captain's choler gradually subsided, and he was pleased\nto desire Hatchway, by the familiar and friendly diminutive of Jack,\nto read a newspaper that lay on the table before him. This task was\naccordingly undertaken by the lame lieutenant, who, among paragraphs,\nread that which follows, with an elevation of voice which seemed to\nprognosticate something extraordinary: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are informed, that Admiral\nBower will very soon be created a British peer, for his eminent services\nduring the war, particularly in his late engagement with the French\nfleet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTrunnion was thunderstruck at this piece of intelligence: the mug\ndropped front his hand, and shivered into a thousand pieces; his eye\nglistened like that of a rattle-snake; and some minutes elapsed before\nhe could pronounce, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAvast! overhaul that article again!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was no sooner read the second time, than, smiting the table with his\nfist, he started up, and, with the most violent emphasis of rage and\nindignation, exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cD-- my heart and liver! 'tis a land lie, d'ye\nsee; and I will maintain it to be a lie, from the sprit-sail yard to the\nmizen-top-sail haulyards! Blood and thunder! Will. Bower a peer of this\nrealm! a fellow of yesterday, that scarce knows a mast from a manger!\na snotty-nose boy, whom I myself have ordered to the gun, for stealing\neggs out of the hen-coops! and I, Hawser Trunnion, who commanded a\nship before he could keep a reckoning, am laid aside, d'ye see, and\nforgotten! If so be as this be the case, there is a rotten plank in our\nconstitution, which ought to be hove down and repaired, d-- my eyes! For\nmy own part, d'ye see, I was none of your Guinea pigs: I did not rise in\nthe service by parlamenteering interest, or a handsome b-- of a wife.\nI was not over the bellies of better men, nor strutted athwart the\nquarter-deck in a laced doublet, and thingumbobs at the wrists. D-- my\nlimbs! I have been a hard-working man, and served all offices on board\nfrom cook's shifter to the command of a vessel. Here, you Tunley,\nthere's the hand of a seaman, you dog.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he laid hold on the landlord's fist, and honoured him with\nsuch a squeeze, as compelled him to roar with great vociferation, to\nthe infinite satisfaction of the commodore, whose features were a little\nunblended by this acknowledgment of his vigour; and he thus proceeded,\nin a less outrageous strain: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey make a d--d noise about this\nengagement with the French: but, egad! it was no more than a bumboat\nbattle, in comparison with some that I have seen. There was old Rook and\nJennings, and another whom I'll be d--d before I name, that knew what\nfighting was. As for my own share, d'ye see, I am none of those that\nhallo in their own commendation: but if so be that I were minded to\nstand my own trumpeter, some of those little fellows that hold their\nheads so high would be taken all aback, as the saying is: they would\nbe ashamed to show their colours, d-- my eyes! I once lay eight glasses\nalongside of the Flour de Louse, a French man-of-war, though her mettle\nwas heavier, and her complement larger by a hundred hands than mine.\nYou, Jack Hatchway, d-- ye, what d'ye grin at! D'ye think I tell a\nstory, because you never heard it before?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, look ye, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the lieutenant, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am glad to find you can\nstand your own trumpeter on occasion; though I wish you would change the\ntune, for that is the same you have been piping every watch for these\nten months past. Tunley himself will tell you he has heard it five\nhundred times.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod forgive you! Mr. Hatchway,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the landlord,\ninterrupting him; \u00e2\u0080\u009cas I am an honest man and a housekeeper, I never\nheard a syllable of the matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis declaration, though not strictly true, was extremely agreeable\nto Mr. Trunnion, who, with an air of triumph, observed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAha! Jack,\nI thought I should bring you up, with your gibes and your jokes: but\nsuppose you had heard it before, is that any reason why it shouldn't\nbe told to another person? There's the stranger, belike he has heard it\nfive hundred times too; han't you, brother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d addressing himself to Mr.\nPickle; who replying, with a look expressing curiosity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, never;\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nthus went on: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, you seem to be an honest, quiet sort of a man;\nand therefore you must know, as I said before, I fell in with a French\nman-of-war, Cape Finistere bearing about six leagues on the weather bow,\nand the chase three leagues to leeward, going before the wind: whereupon\nI set my studding sails; and coming up with her, hoisted my jack and\nensign, and poured in a broadside, before you could count three rattlins\nin the mizen shrouds; for I always keep a good look-out, and love to\nhave the first fire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat I'll be sworn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hatchway: \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor the day we made the Triumph\nyou ordered the men to fire when she was hull-to, by the same token we\nbelow pointed the guns at a flight of gulls; and I won a can of punch\nfrom the gunner by killing the first bird.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nExasperated at this sarcasm, he replied, with great vehemence, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou lie,\nlubber! D-- your bones! what business have you to come always athwart\nmy hawse in this manner? You, Pipes, was upon deck, and can bear witness\nwhether or not I fired too soon. Speak, you blood of a ----, and that\nupon the word of a seaman: how did the chase bear of us when I gave\norders to fire?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPipes, who had hitherto sat silent, being thus called upon to give his\nevidence, after divers strange gesticulations, opened his mouth like\na gasping cod, and with a cadence like that of the east wind singing\nthrough a cranny, pronounced, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHalf a quarter of a league right upon our\nlee-beam.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNearer, you porpuss-faced swab,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the commodore, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnearer by\ntwelve fathom: but, howsomever, that's enough to prove the falsehood of\nHatchway's jaw--and so, brother, d'ye see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d turning to Pickle, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI lay\nalongside of the Flour de Louse, yard-arm and yard-arm, plying out great\nguns and small arms, and heaving in stink-pots, powder-bottles, and\nhand-grenades, till our shot was all expended, double-headed, partridge\nand grape: then we loaded with iron crows, marlin-spikes, and old nails;\nbut finding the Frenchman took a good deal of drubbing, and that he had\nshot away all our rigging, and killed and wounded a great number of our\nmen, d'ye see, I resolved to run him on board upon his quarter, and so\nordered our grapplings to be got ready; but monsieur, perceiving what we\nwere about, filled his topsails and sheered off, leaving us like a log\nupon the water, and our scuppers running with blood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Pickle and the landlord paid such extraordinary attention to the\nrehearsal of this exploit, that Trunnion was encouraged to entertain\nthem with more stories of the same nature; after which he observed, by\nway of encomium on the government, that all he had gained in the service\nwas a lame foot and the loss of an eye. The lieutenant, who could not\nfind in his heart to lose any opportunity of being witty at the expense\nof his commander, gave a loose to his satirical talent once more,\nsaying,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have heard as how you came by your lame foot, by having\nyour upper decks over-stowed with liquor, whereby you became crank, and\nrolled, d'ye see, in such a manner, that by a pitch of the ship your\nstarboard heel was jammed in one of the scuppers; and as for the matter\nof your eye, that was knocked out by your own crew when the Lightning\nwas paid off: there's poor Pipes, who was beaten into all the colours of\nthe rainbow for taking your part, and giving you time to sheer off; and\nI don't find as how you have rewarded him according as he deserves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs the commodore could not deny the truth of these anecdotes, however\nunseasonably they were introduced, he affected to receive them with good\nhumour, as jokes of the lieutenant's own inventing; and replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\nay, Jack, everybody knows your tongue is no slander; but, howsomever,\nI'll work you to an oil for this, you dog.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he lifted up one\nof his crutches, intending to lay it gently across Mr. Hatchway's pate;\nbut Jack, with great agility, tilted up his wooden leg, with which he\nwarded off the blow, to the no small admiration of Mr. Pickle, and utter\nastonishment of the landlord, who, by the bye, had expressed the same\namazement, at the same feet, at the same hour, every night, for three\nmonths before. Trunnion then, directing his eye to the boatswain's mate,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou, Pipes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo you go about and tell people that I did not\nreward you for standing by me, when I was bustled by these rebellious\nrapscallions? D-- you, han't you been rated on the books ever since?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTom, who indeed had no words to spare, sat smoking his pipe with\ngreat indifference, and never dreamed of paying any regard to these\ninterrogations; which being repeated and reinforced with many oaths,\nthat, however, produced no effect, the commodore pulled out his purse,\nsaying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere, you b-- baby, here's something better than a smart\nticket;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and threw it at his silent deliverer, who received and pocketed\nhis bounty, without the least demonstration of surprise or satisfaction;\nwhile the donor, turning to Mr. Pickle, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see, brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nmake good the old saying; we sailors get money like horses, and spend\nit like asses: come, Pipes, let's have the boatswain's whistle, and be\njovial.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis musician accordingly applied to his mouth the silver instrument\nthat hung at the button-hole of his jacket, by a chain of the same\nmetal, and though not quite so ravishing as the pipe of Hermes, produced\na sound so loud and shrill, that the stranger, as it were instinctively,\nstopped his ears, to preserve his organs of hearing from such a\ndangerous invasion. The prelude being thus executed, Pipes fixed his\neyes upon the egg of an ostrich that depended from the ceiling, and\nwithout once moving them from that object, performed the whole cantata\nin a tone of voice that seemed to be the joint issue of an Irish bagpipe\nand a sow-gelder's horn: the commodore, the lieutenant, and landlord,\njoined in the chorus, repeating this elegant stanza:--\n\n    Bustle, bustle, brave boys!\n      Let us sing, let us toil,\n      And drink all the while,\n      Since labour's the price of our joys.\n\n\nThe third line was no sooner pronounced, than the can was lifted to\nevery man's mouth with admirable uniformity; and the next word taken\nup at the end of their draught with a twang equally expressive and\nharmonious. In short, the company began to understand one another;\nMr. Pickle seemed to relish the entertainment, and a correspondence\nimmediately commenced between him and Trunnion, who shook him by the\nhand, drank to further acquaintance, and even invited him to a mess\nof pork and pease in the garrison. The compliment was returned,\ngood-fellowship prevailed, and the night was pretty far advanced, when\nthe merchant's man arrived with a lantern to light his master home; upon\nwhich, the new friends parted, after a mutual promise of meeting next\nevening in the same place.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\n\nMrs. Grizzle exerts herself in finding a proper Match for her Brother;\nwho is accordingly introduced to the young Lady, whom he marries in due\nSeason.\n\n\nI have been the more circumstantial in opening the character of\nTrunnion, because he bears a considerable share in the course of these\nmemoirs; but now it is high time to resume the consideration of Mrs.\nGrizzle, who, since her arrival in the country, had been engrossed by a\ndouble care, namely, that of finding a suitable match for her brother,\nand a comfortable yoke-fellow for herself.\n\nNeither was this aim the result of any sinister or frail aggression, but\nthe pure dictates of that laudable ambition, which prompted her to the\npreservation of the family name. Nay, so disinterested was she in this\npursuit, that, postponing her nearest concern, or at least leaving her\nown fate to the silent operation of her charms, she laboured with such\nindefatigable zeal in behalf of her brother, that before they had been\nthree months settled in the country, the general topic of conversation\nin the neighbourhood was an intended match between the rich Mr. Pickle\nand the fair Miss Appleby, daughter of a gentleman who lived in the\nnext parish, and who though he had but little fortune to bestow upon his\nchildren, had, to use his own phrase, replenished their veins with some\nof the best blood in the country.\n\nThis young lady, whose character and disposition Mrs. Grizzle had\ninvestigated to her own satisfaction, was destined for the spouse of\nMr. Pickle; and an overture accordingly made to her father, who, being\noverjoyed at the proposal, gave his consent without hesitation, and even\nrecommended the immediate execution of the project with such eagerness,\nas seemed to indicate either a suspicion of Mr. Pickle's constancy, or\na diffidence of his own daughter's complexion, which perhaps he thought\ntoo sanguine to keep much longer cool. The previous point being thus\nsettled, our merchant, at the instigation of Mrs. Grizzle, went to visit\nhis future father-in-law, and was introduced to the daughter, with whom\nhe had, that same afternoon, an opportunity of being alone. What passed\nin that interview I never could learn, though from the character of the\nsuitor, the reader may justly conclude that she was not much teased\nwith the impertinence of his addresses. He was not, I believe, the less\nwelcome for that reason: certain it is she made no objection to his\ntaciturnity; and when her father communicated his resolution, acquiesced\nwith the most pious resignation. But Mrs. Grizzle, in order to give\nthe lady a more favourable idea of his intellects than his conversation\ncould possibly inspire, resolved to dictate a letter, which her brother\nshould transcribe and transmit to his mistress as the produce of his own\nunderstanding, and had actually composed a very tender billet for\nthis purpose; yet her intention was entirely frustrated by the\nmisapprehension of the lover himself, who, in consequence of his\nsister's repeated admonitions, anticipated her scheme, by writing, for\nhimself, and despatching the letter one afternoon, while Mrs. Grizzle\nwas visiting at the parson's.\n\nNeither was this step the effect of his vanity or precipitation; but\nhaving been often assured by his sister that it was absolutely necessary\nfor him to make a declaration of his love in writing, he took\nthis opportunity of acting in conformity with her advice, when his\nimagination was unengaged or undisturbed by any other suggestion,\nwithout suspecting in the least that she intended to save him the\ntrouble of exercising his own genius. Left, therefore, as he imagined,\nto his own inventions, he sat down, and produced the following morceau,\nwhich was transmitted to Miss Appleby, before his sister and counsellor\nhad the least intimation of the affair:--\n\n                    \u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Sally Appleby.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,--Understanding you have a parcel of heart, warranted\n    sound, to be disposed of, shall be pleased to treat for said\n    commodity, on reasonable terms; doubt not, shall agree for\n    same; shall wait on you for further information, when and where\n    you shall appoint. This the needful from--Yours, etc.\n\n                                    \u00e2\u0080\u009cGam. Pickle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis laconic epistle, simple and unadorned as it was, met with as\ncordial a reception from the person to whom it was addressed, as if it\nhad been couched in the most elegant terms that delicacy of passion and\ncultivated genius could supply; nay, I believe, was the more welcome on\naccount of its mercantile plainness; because when an advantageous match\nis in view, a sensible woman often considers the flowery professions and\nrapturous exclamations of love as ensnaring ambiguities, or, at best,\nimpertinent preliminaries, that retard the treaty they are designed to\npromote; whereas Mr. Pickle removed all disagreeable uncertainty, by\ndescending at once to the most interesting particular.\n\nShe had no sooner, as a dutiful child, communicated this billet-doux to\nher father, than he, as a careful parent, visited Mr. Pickle, and,\nin presence of Mrs. Grizzle, demanded a formal explanation of his\nsentiments with regard to his daughter Sally. Mr. Gamaliel, without any\nceremony, assured him he had a respect for the young woman, and, with\nhis good leave, would take her for better, for worse. Mr. Appleby, after\nhaving expressed his satisfaction that he had fixed his affections\nin his family, comforted the lover with the assurance of his being\nagreeable to the young lady; and they forthwith proceeded to the\narticles of the marriage-settlement, which being discussed and\ndetermined, a lawyer was ordered to engross them; the wedding-clothes\nwere bought, and, in short, a day was appointed for the celebration of\ntheir nuptials, to which everybody of any fashion in the neighbourhood\nwas invited. Among these, commodore Trunnion and Mr. Hatchway were not\nforgotten, being the sole companions of the bridegroom, with whom, by\nthis time, they had contracted a sort of intimacy at their nocturnal\nrendezvous.\n\nThey had received a previous intimation of what was on the anvil, from\nthe landlord, before Mr. Pickle thought proper to declare himself; in\nconsequence of which, the topic of the one-eyed commander's discourse,\nat their meeting, for several evenings before, had been the folly and\nplague of matrimony, on which he held forth with great vehemence of\nabuse, leveled at the fair sex, whom he represented as devils incarnate,\nsent from hell to torment mankind; and in particular inveighed against\nold maids, for whom he seemed to entertain a singular aversion;\nwhile his friend Jack confirmed the truth of all his allegations, and\ngratified his own malignant vein at the same time by clenching every\nsentence with a sly joke upon the married state, built upon some\nallusion to a ship or sea-faring life. He compared a woman to a great\ngun loaded with fire, brimstone, and noise, which, being violently\nheated, will bounce and fly, and play the devil, if you don't take\nspecial care of her breechings. He said she was like a hurricane that\nnever blows from one quarter, but veers about to all points of the\ncompass. He likened her to a painted galley, curiously rigged, with\na leak in her hold, which her husband would never be able to stop. He\nobserved that her inclinations were like the Bay of Biscay; for why?\nbecause you may heave your deep sea lead long enough without ever\nreaching the bottom; that he who comes to anchor on a wife may find\nhimself moored in d--d foul ground, and after all, can't for his blood\nslip his cable; and that, for his own part, though he might make short\ntrips for pastime, he would never embark in woman on the voyage of life,\nhe was afraid of foundering in the first foul weather.\n\nIn all probability, these insinuations made some impression on the mind\nof Mr. Pickle, who was not very much inclined to run great risks of any\nkind; but the injunctions and importunities of his sister, who was bent\nupon the match, overbalanced the opinion of his sea friends, who finding\nhim determined to marry, notwithstanding all the hints of caution they\nhad thrown out, resolved to accept his invitation, and honoured his\nnuptials with their presence accordingly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\n\nThe Behaviour of Mrs. Grizzle at the Wedding, with an Account of the\nGuests.\n\n\nI hope it will not be thought uncharitable, if I advance, by way of\nconjecture, that Mrs. Grizzle, on this grand occasion, summoned her\nwhole exertion to play off the artillery of her charms on the single\ngentlemen who were invited to the entertainment; sure I am, she\ndisplayed to the best advantage all the engaging qualities she\npossessed; her affability at dinner was altogether uncommon, her\nattention to the guests was superfluously hospitable, her tongue was\nsheathed with a most agreeable and infantine lisp, her address was\nperfectly obliging, and though conscious of the extraordinary capacity\nof her month, she would not venture to hazard a laugh, she modelled her\nlips into an enchanting simper, which played on her countenance all\nday long; nay, she even profited by that defect in her vision we have\nalready observed, and securely contemplated those features which were\nmost to her liking, while the rest of the company believed her regards\nwere disposed in a quite contrary direction. With what humility of\ncomplaisance did she receive the compliments of those who could not help\npraising the elegance of the banquet; and how piously did she seize that\nopportunity of commemorating the honours of her sire, by observing that\nit was no merit in her to understand something of entertainments, as she\nhad occasion to preside at so many, during the mayoralty of her papa!\n\nFar from discovering the least symptom of pride and exultation when the\nopulence of her family became the subject of conversation, she assumed\na severity of countenance; and, after having moralized on the vanity\nof riches, declared that those who looked on her as a fortune were very\nmuch mistaken; for her father had left her no more than a poor five\nthousand pounds, which, with what little she had saved of the interest\nsince his death, was all she had to depend on: indeed, if she had placed\nher chief felicity in wealth, she should not have been so forward in\ndestroying her own expectations, by advising and promoting the event\nat which they were now so happily assembled; but she hoped she should\nalways have virtue enough to postpone any interested consideration, when\nit should happen to clash with the happiness of her friends. Finally,\nsuch was her modesty and self-denial that she industriously informed\nthose whom it might concern, that she was no less than three years older\nthan the bride; though had she added ten to the reckoning, she would\nhave committed no mistake in point of computation.\n\nTo contribute as much as lay in her power to the satisfaction of\nall present, she in the afternoon regaled them with a tune on the\nharpsichord, accompanied with her voice, which, though not the most\nmelodious in the world, I dare say, would have been equally at their\nservice could she have vied with Philomel in song; and as the last\neffort of her complaisance, when dancing was proposed, she was prevailed\non, at the request of her new sister, to open the ball in person.\n\nIn a word, Mrs. Grizzle was the principal figure in this festival,\nand almost eclipsed the bride; who, far from seeming to dispute the\npre-eminence, very wisely allowed her to make the best of her talents;\ncontenting herself with the lot to which fortune had already called\nher and which she imagined would not be the less desirable if her\nsister-in-law were detached from the family.\n\nI believe I need scarce advertise the reader that, during this whole\nentertainment, the commodore and his lieutenant were quite out of their\nelement; and this, indeed, was the case with the bridegroom himself,\nwho being utterly unacquainted with any sort of polite commerce, found\nhimself under a very disagreeable restraint during the whole scene.\n\nTrunnion, who had scarce ever been on shore till he was paid off, and\nnever once in his whole life in the company of any females above the\nrank of those who herd on the Point at Portsmouth, was more embarrassed\nabout his behaviour than if he had been surrounded at sea by the whole\nFrench navy. He had never pronounced the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cmadam\u00e2\u0080\u009d since he was born;\nso that, far from entering into conversation with the ladies, he would\nnot even return the compliment, or give the least note of civility\nwhen they drank to his health, and, I verily believe, would rather have\nsuffered suffocation than allowed the simple phrase--\u00e2\u0080\u009cyour servant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to\nproceed from his mouth. He was altogether as inflexible with respect to\nthe attitudes of his body; for, either through obstinacy or bashfulness,\nhe sat upright without motion, insomuch that he provoked the mirth of\na certain wag, who, addressing himself to the lieutenant, asked whether\nthat was the commodore himself, or the wooden lion that used to stand at\nhis gate?--an image, to which, it must be owned, Mr. Trunnion's person\nbore no faint resemblance.\n\nMr. Hatchway, who was not quite so unpolished as the commodore, and had\ncertain notions that seemed to approach the ideas of common life, made\na less uncouth appearance; but then he was a wit, and though of a very\npeculiar genius, partook largely of that disposition which is common to\nall wits, who never enjoy themselves except when their talents meet with\nthose marks of distinction and veneration, which, in their own opinion,\nthey deserve.\n\nThese circumstances being premised, it is not to be wondered at, if this\ntriumvirate made no objections to the proposal, when some of the graver\npersonages of the company made a motion for adjourning into another\napartment, where they might enjoy their pipes and bottles, while\nthe young folks indulged themselves in the continuance of their\nown favourite diversion. Thus rescued, as it were, from a state of\nannihilation, the first use the two lads of the castle made of their\nexistence, was to ply the bridegroom so hard with bumpers, that in less\nthan an hour he made divers efforts to sing, and soon after was carried\nto bed, deprived of all manner of sensation, to the utter disappointment\nof the bridemen and maids, who, by this accident, were prevented from\nthrowing the stocking, and performing certain other ceremonies practised\non such occasions. As for the bride, she bore this misfortune with\ngreat good humour, and indeed, on all occasions, behaved like a discreet\nwoman, perfectly well acquainted with the nature of her own situation.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\n\nMrs. Pickle assumes the Reins of Government in her own Family--Her\nSister-in-law undertakes an Enterprise of great Moment, but is for some\ntime diverted from her Purpose by a very interesting Consideration.\n\n\nWhatever deference, not to say submission, she had paid to Mrs. Grizzle\nbefore she nearly allied to her family, she no sooner became Mrs.\nPickle, than she thought it encumbent on her to act up to the dignity of\nthe character; and, the very day after the marriage, ventured to dispute\nwith her sister-in-law on the subject of her own pedigree, which she\naffirmed to be more honourable in all respects than that of her husband;\nobserving that several younger brothers of her house had arrived at\nthe station of lord-mayor of London, which was the highest pitch of\ngreatness that any of Mr. Pickle's predecessors had ever attained.\n\nThis presumption was like a thunderbolt to Mrs. Grizzle, who began to\nperceive that she had not succeeded quite so well as she imagined, in\nselecting for her brother a gentle and obedient yoke-fellow, who would\nalways treat her with that profound respect which she thought due to her\nsuperior genius, and be entirely regulated by her advice and direction:\nhowever, she still continued to manage the reins of government in the\nhouse, reprehending the servants as usual; an office she performed with\ngreat capacity, and in which she seemed to take singular delight, until\nMrs. Pickle, on pretence of consulting her ease, told her one day\nshe would take that trouble on herself, and for the future assume the\nmanagement of her own family. Nothing could be more mortifying to Mrs.\nGrizzle than such a declaration; to which, after a considerable pause,\nand strange distortion of look, she replied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall never refuse\nor repine at any trouble that may conduce to my brother's\nadvantage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cDear madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the sister, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am infinitely obliged\nfor your kind concern for Mr. Pickle's interest, which I consider as my\nown, but I cannot bear to see you a sufferer by your friendship; and,\ntherefore, insist on exempting you from the fatigue you have borne so\nlong.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn vain did the other protest that she took pleasure in the task:\nMrs. Pickle ascribed the assurance to her excess of complaisance; and\nexpressed such tenderness of zeal for her dear sister's health and\ntranquility, that the reluctant maiden found herself obliged to resign\nher authority, without enjoying the least pretext for complaining of her\nbeing deposed.\n\nThis disgrace was attended by a fit of peevish devotion that lasted\nthree or four weeks; during which period she had the additional chagrin\nof seeing the young lady gain an absolute ascendency over the mind of\nher brother, who was persuaded to set up a gay equipage, and improve\nhis housekeeping, by an augmentation in his expense, to the amount of\na thousand a year at least: though his alteration in the economy of his\nhousehold effected no change in his own disposition, or manner of life;\nfor as soon as the painful ceremony of receiving and returning visits\nwas performed, he had recourse to the company of his sea friends, with\nwhom he spent the best part of his time. But if he was satisfied with\nhis condition, the case was otherwise with Mrs. Grizzle, who, finding\nher importance in the family greatly diminished, her attractions\nneglected by all the male sex in the neighbourhood, and the withering\nhand of time hang threatening over her head, began to feel the horror of\neternal virginity, and, in a sort of desperation, resolved at any rate\nto rescue herself from that reproachful and uncomfortable situation.\n\nThus determined, she formed a plan, the execution of which to a\nspirit less enterprising and sufficient than hers, would have appeared\naltogether impracticable: this was no other than to make a conquest of\nthe commodore's heart, which the reader will easily believe was not very\nsusceptible of tender impressions; but, on the contrary, fortified with\ninsensibility and prejudice against the charms of the whole sex, and\nparticularly prepossessed to the prejudice of that class distinguished\nby the appellation of old maids, in which Mrs. Grizzle was by this time\nunhappily ranked. She nevertheless took the field, and having invested\nthis seemingly impregnable fortress, began to break ground one day,\nwhen Trunnion dined at her brother's, by springing certain ensnaring\ncommendations on the honesty and sincerity of sea-faring people,\npaying a particular attention to his plate, and affecting a simper of\napprobation at everything which he said, which by any means she could\nconstrue into a joke, or with modesty be supposed to hear: nay, even\nwhen he left decency on the left hand, which was often the case, she\nventured to reprimand his freedom of speech with a grin, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSure\nyou gentlemen belonging to the sea have such an odd way with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But\nall this complacency was so ineffectual, that, far from suspecting the\ntrue cause of it, the commodore, that very evening, at the club, in\npresence of her brother, with whom by this time he could take any manner\nof freedom, did not scruple to d-- her for a squinting, block-faced,\nchattering p-- kitchen; and immediately after drank \u00e2\u0080\u009cDespair to all old\nmaids.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The toast Mr. Pickle pledged without the least hesitation, and\nnext day intimated to his sister, who bore the indignity with surprising\nresignation, and did not therefore desist from her scheme, unpromising\nas it seemed to be, until her attention was called off, and engaged\nin another care, which for some time interrupted the progress of this\ndesign.\n\nHer sister had not been married many months, when she exhibited evident\nsymptoms of pregnancy, to the general satisfaction of all concerned, and\nthe inexpressible joy of Mrs. Grizzle, who, as we have already hinted,\nwas more interested in the preservation of the family name than in\nany other consideration whatever. She therefore no sooner discovered\nappearances to justify and confirm her hopes, than, postponing her own\npurpose, and laying aside that pique and resentment she had conceived\nfrom the behaviour of Mrs. Pickle, when she superseded her authority;\nor perhaps, considering her in no other light than that of the vehicle\nwhich contained, and was destined to convey, her brother's heir to\nlight, she determined to exert her uttermost in nursing, tending, and\ncherishing her during the term of her important charge. With this\nview she purchased Culpepper's Midwifery, which with that sagacious\nperformance dignified with Aristotle's name, she studied with\nindefatigable care; and diligently perused the Complete Housewife,\ntogether with Quincy's Dispensatory, culling every jelly, marmalade, and\nconserve which these authors recommend as either salutary or toothsome,\nfor the benefit and comfort of her sister-in-law, during her gestation.\nShe restricted her from eating roots, pot-herbs, fruit, and all sorts of\nvegetables; and one day, when Mrs. Pickle had plucked a peach with her\nown hand, and was in the very act of putting it between her teeth, Mrs.\nGrizzle perceived the rash attempt, and running up to her, fell on her\nknees in the garden, entreating her, with tears in her eyes, to desist\nsuch a pernicious appetite. Her request was no sooner complied with,\nthan recollecting, that if her sister's longing was balked, the child\nmight be affected with some disagreeable mark or deplorable disease, she\nbegged as earnestly that she would swallow the fruit, and in the mean\ntime ran for some cordial water of her own composing, which she forced\non her sister, as an antidote to the poison she had received.\n\nThis excessive zeal and tenderness did not fail to be very troublesome\nto Mrs. Pickle, who, having resolved divers plans for the recovery\nof her own ease, at length determined to engage Mrs. Grizzle in such\nemployment as would interrupt that close attendance, which she found so\nteasing and disagreeable. Neither did she wait long for an opportunity\nof putting her resolution in practice. The very next day a gentleman\nhappening to dine with Mr. Pickle, unfortunately mentioned a pine-apple,\npart of which he had eaten a week before at the house of a nobleman, who\nlived in another part of the country, at the distance of a hundred miles\nat least.\n\nThe name of this fatal fruit was no sooner pronounced, than Mrs.\nGrizzle, who incessantly watched her sister's looks, took the alarm,\nbecause she thought they gave certain indications of curiosity and\ndesire; and after having observed that she herself could never eat\npine-apples, which were altogether unnatural productions, extorted\nby the force of artificial fire out of filthy manure, asked, with a\nfaltering voice, if Mrs. Pickle was not of her way of thinking? This\nyoung lady, who wanted neither slyness nor penetration, at once divined\nher meaning, and replied, with seeming unconcern, that for her own part\nshe should never repine if there was no pine-apple in the universe,\nprovided she could indulge herself with the fruits of her own country.\n\nThis answer was calculated for the benefit of the stranger, who would\ncertainly have suffered for his imprudence by the resentment of Mrs.\nGrizzle, had her sister expressed the least relish for the fruit in\nquestion. It had the desired effect, and re-established the peace of the\ncompany, which was not a little endangered by the gentleman's want of\nconsideration. Next morning, however, after breakfast, the pregnant\nlady, in pursuance of her plan, yawned, as it were by accident, full in\nthe face of her maiden sister, who being infinitely disturbed by this\nconvulsion, affirmed it was a symptom of longing, and insisted upon\nknowing the object in desire; when Mrs. Pickle affecting a smile\ntold her she had eaten a most delicious pine-apple in her sleep. This\ndeclaration was attended with an immediate scream, uttered by\nMrs. Grizzle, who instantly perceiving her sister surprised at the\nexclamation, clasped her in her arms, and assured her, with a sort of\nhysterical laugh, that she could not help screaming with joy, because\nshe had it in her power to gratify her dear sister's wish; a lady in\nthe neighbourhood having promised to send her, as a present, a couple of\ndelicate pine-apples, which she would on that very day go in quest of.\n\nMrs. Pickle would by no means consent to this proposal, on pretence of\nsparing the other unnecessary fatigue; and assured her, that if she had\nany desire to eat a pine-apple, it was so faint, that the disappointment\ncould produce no bad consequence. But this assurance was conveyed in\na manner, which she knew very well how to adopt, that, instead of\ndissuading, rather stimulated Mrs. Grizzle to set out immediately, not\non a visit to that lady, whose promise she herself had feigned with\na view of consulting her sister's tranquility, but on a random Search\nthrough the whole country for this unlucky fruit, which was like to\nproduce so much vexation and prejudice to her and her father's house.\n\nDuring three whole days and nights did she, attended by a valet, ride\nfrom place to place without success, unmindful of her health, and\ncareless of her reputation, that began to suffer from the nature of her\ninquiry, which was pursued with such peculiar eagerness and distraction,\nthat everybody with whom she conversed, looked upon her as an unhappy\nperson, whose intellects were not a little disordered.\n\nBaffled in all her researches within the country, she at length decided\nto visit that very nobleman at whose house the officious stranger had\nbeen (for her) so unfortunately regaled, and actually arrived, in a\npost-chaise, at the place of his habitation, when she introduced her\nbusiness as an affair on which the happiness of a whole family depended.\nBy virtue of a present to his lordship's gardener, she procured the\nHesperian fruit, with which she returned in triumph.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\n\nMrs. Grizzle is indefatigable in gratifying her Sister's\nLongings--Peregrine is born, and managed contrary to the Directions\nand Remonstrances of his Aunt, who is disgusted upon that account, and\nresumes the Plan which she had before rejected.\n\n\nThe success of this device would have encouraged Mrs. Pickle to practise\nmore of the same sort upon her sister-in-law, had she not been deterred\nby a violent fever which seized her zealous ally, in consequence of the\nfatigue and uneasiness she had undergone; which, while it lasted, as\neffectually conduced to her repose, as any other stratagem she could\ninvent. But Mrs. Grizzle's health was no sooner restored, than the\nother, being as much incommoded as ever, was obliged, in her own\ndefence, to have recourse to some other contrivance; and managed her\nartifices in such a manner, as leaves it at this day a doubt whether she\nwas really so whimsical and capriccios in her appetites as she herself\npretended to be; for her longings were not restricted to the demands of\nthe palate and stomach, but also affected all the other organs of sense,\nand even invaded her imagination, which at this period seemed to be\nstrangely diseased.\n\nOne time she longed to pinch her husband's ear; and it was with infinite\ndifficulty that his sister could prevail upon him to undergo the\noperation. Yet this task was easy, in comparison with another she\nundertook for the gratification of Mrs. Pickle's unaccountable desire;\nwhich was no other than to persuade the commodore to submit his chin\nto the mercy of the big-bellied lady, who ardently wished for an\nopportunity of plucking three black hairs from his beard. When this\nproposal was first communicated to Mr. Trunnion by the husband, his\nanswer was nothing but a dreadful effusion of oaths, accompanied with\nsuch a stare, and delivered in such a tone of voice, as terrified the\npoor beseecher into immediate silence; so that Mrs. Grizzle was fain\nto take the whole enterprise upon herself, and next day went to the\ngarrison accordingly, where, having obtained entrance by means of the\nlieutenant, who, while his commander was asleep, ordered her to be\nadmitted for the joke's sake, she waited patiently till he turned out,\nand then accosted him in the yard, where he used to perform his morning\nwalk. He was thunderstruck at the appearance of a woman in a place he\nhad hitherto kept sacred from the whole sex, and immediately began to\nutter an apostrophe to Tom Pipes, whose turn it was then to watch; when\nMrs. Grizzle, falling on her knees before him, conjured him, with many\npathetic supplications, to hear and grant her request, which was no\nsooner signified, than he bellowed in such an outrageous manner that the\nwhole court re-echoed the opprobrious term b--, and the word damnation,\nwhich he repeated with surprising volubility, without any sort of\npropriety or connection; and retreated into his penetralia, leaving the\nbaffled devotee in the humble posture she had so unsuccessfully chosen\nto melt his obdurate heart.\n\nMortifying as this repulse must have been to a lady of her stately\ndisposition, she did not relinquish her aim, but endeavoured to interest\nthe commodore's counsellors and adherents in her cause. With this view\nshe solicited the interest of Mr. Hatchway, who, being highly pleased\nwith a circumstance so productive of mirth and diversion, readily\nentered into her measures, and promised to employ his whole influence\nfor her satisfaction; and as for the boatswain's mate, he was rendered\npropitious by the present of a guinea, which she slipped into his hand.\nIn short, Mrs. Grizzle was continually engaged in this negotiation for\nthe space of ten days, during which, the commodore was so incessantly\npestered with her remonstrances, and the admonitions of his associates,\nthat he swore his people had a design upon his life, which becoming a\nburden to him, he at last complied, and was conducted to the scene like\na victim to the altar, or rather like a reluctant bear, when he is led\nto the stake amidst the shouts and cries of butchers and their dogs.\nAfter all, this victory was not quite so decisive as the conquerors\nimagined; for the patient being set, and the performer prepared with\na pair of pincers, a small difficulty occurred: she could not for some\ntime discern one black hair on the whole superficies of Mr. Trunnion's\nface, when Mrs. Grizzle, very much alarmed and disconcerted, had\nrecourse to a magnifying-glass that stood upon her toilet; and, after a\nmost accurate examination, discovered a fibre of a dusky hue, to which\nthe instrument being applied, Mrs. Pickle pulled it up by the roots, to\nthe no small discomposure of the owner, who, feeling the smart much more\nsevere than he had expected, started up, and swore he would not part\nwith another hair to save them all from damnation.\n\nMr. Hatchway exhorted him to patience and resignation; Mrs. Grizzle\nrepeated her entreaties with great humility; but finding him deaf to all\nher prayers, and absolutely bent upon leaving the house, she clasped his\nknees, and begged for the love of God that he would have compassion upon\na distressed family, and endure a little more for the sake of the poor\ninfant, who would otherwise be born with a gray beard upon its chin.\nFar from being melted, he was rather exasperated by this reflection; to\nwhich he replied with great indignation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cD-- you for a yaw-sighted b--!\nI'll be hanged, long enough before he has any beard at all:\u00e2\u0080\u009d so saying,\nhe disengaged himself from her embraces, flung out at the door, and\nhalted homewards with such surprising speed, that the lieutenant could\nnot overtake him until he had arrived at his own gate; and Mrs.\nGrizzle was so much affected with his escape, that her sister, in pure\ncompassion, desired she would not afflict herself, protesting that her\nown wish was already gratified, for she had plucked three hairs at once,\nhaving from the beginning been dubious of the commodore's patience.\n\nBut the labours of this assiduous kinswoman did not end with the\nachievement of this adventure: her eloquence or industry was employed\nwithout ceasing in the performance of other tasks imposed by the\ningenious craft of her sister-in-law, who at another time conceived an\ninsuppressible affection for a fricassee of frogs, which should be the\ngenuine natives of France; so that there was a necessity for despatching\na messenger on purpose to that kingdom; but as she could not depend\nupon the integrity of any common servant, Mrs. Grizzle undertook that\nprovince, and actually set sail in a cutter for Boulogne, from whence\nshe returned in eight-and-forty hours with a tub full of those live\nanimals, which being dressed according to art, her sister did not\ntaste them, on pretence that her fit of longing was past: but then her\ninclinations took a different turn, and fixed themselves upon a curious\nimplement belonging to a lady of quality in the neighbourhood, which\nwas reported to be a great curiosity: this was no other than a porcelain\nchamber-pot of admirable workmanship, contrived by the honourable owner,\nwho kept it for her own private use, and cherished it as a utensil of\ninestimable value.\n\nMrs. Grizzle shuddered at the first hint, she received of her sister's\ndesire to possess this piece of furniture; because she knew it was not\nto be purchased; and the lady's character, which was none of the most\namiable in point of humanity and condescension, forbad all hopes of\nborrowing it for a season: she therefore attempted to reason down this\ncapricious appetite, as an extravagance of imagination which ought to be\ncombated and repressed; and Mrs. Pickle, to all appearance was convinced\nand satisfied by her arguments and advice; but, nevertheless, could make\nuse of no other convenience, and was threatened with a very dangerous\nsuppression. Roused at the peril in which she supposed her to be,\nMrs. Grizzle flew to the lady's house, and, having obtained a private\naudience, disclosed the melancholy situation of her sister, and implored\nthe benevolence of her ladyship, who, contrary to expectation, received\nher very graciously, and consented to indulge Mrs. Pickle's longing. Mr.\nPickle began to be out of humour at the expense to which he was exposed\nby the caprice of his wife, who was herself alarmed at this last\naccident, and for the future kept her fancy within bounds; insomuch,\nthat without being subject to any more extraordinary trouble, Mrs.\nGrizzle reaped the long-wished fruits of her dearest expectation in the\nbirth of a fine boy, whom her sister in a few months brought into the\nworld.\n\nI shall omit the description of the rejoicings, which were infinite on\nthis important occasion, and only observe that Mrs. Pickle's mother and\naunt stood godmothers, and the commodore assisted at the ceremony as\ngodfather to the child, who was christened by the name of Peregrine, in\ncompliment to the memory of a deceased uncle. While the mother confined\nto her bed, and incapable of maintaining her own authority, Mrs. Grizzle\ntook charge of the infant baby by a double claim, and superintended, with\nsurprising vigilance, the nurse and midwife in all the particulars of\ntheir respective offices, which were performed by her express direction.\nBut no sooner was Mrs. Pickle in a condition to reassume the management\nof her own affairs, when she thought proper to alter certain regulations\nconcerning the child, which had obtained in consequence of her sister's\norders, directing, among other innovations, that the bandages with which\nthe infant had been so neatly rolled up, like an Egyptian mummy, should\nbe loosened and laid aside, in order to rid nature of all restraint,\nand give the blood free scope to circulate; and, with her own hands she\nplunged him headlong every morning into a tub full of cold water. This\noperation seemed so barbarous to the tender-hearted Mrs. Grizzle, that\nshe not only opposed it with all her eloquence, shedding abundance of\ntears over the sacrifice when it was made; and took horse immediately,\nand departed for the habitation of an eminent country physician, whom\nshe consulted in these words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cPray, doctor, is it not both dangerous\nand cruel to be the means of letting a poor tender infant perish\nby sousing it in water as cold as ice?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the doctor,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cdownright murder, I affirm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see you are a person of great learning\nand sagacity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I must beg you will be so good as\nto signify your opinion in your own handwriting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The doctor immediately\ncomplied with her request, and expressed himself upon a slip of paper to\nthis purpose:--\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese are to certify whom it may concern, that I firmly\n    believe, and it is my unalterable opinion, that who soever\n    letteth an infant perish, by sousing it in cold water, even\n    though the said water should not be so cold as ice, is in\n    effect guilty of the murder of the said infant, as witness\n    my hand,\n                       \u00e2\u0080\u009cComfit Colocynth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nHaving obtained this certificate, for which the physician was handsomely\nacknowledged, she returned, exalting, and hoping, with such authority,\nto overthrow all opposition. Accordingly, next morning, when her nephew\nwas about to undergo his diurnal baptism, she produced the commission,\nwhereby she conceived herself empowered to overrule such inhuman\nproceedings, but she was disappointed in her expectation, confident as\nit was; not that Mrs. Pickle pretended to differ in opinion from Dr.\nColocynth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor whose character and sentiments,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have such\nveneration, that I shall carefully observe the caution implied in this\nvery certificate, by which, far from condemning my method of practice,\nhe only asserts that killing is murder; an asseveration, the truth of\nwhich, it is to be hoped, I shall never dispute.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Grizzle, who, sooth to say, had rather too superficially considered\nthe clause by which she thought herself authorized, perused the paper\nwith more accuracy, and was confounded at her own want of penetration.\nYet, though she was confuted, she was by no means convinced that her\nobjections to the cold bath were unreasonable; on the contrary, after\nhaving bestowed sundry opprobrious epithets on the physician, for his\nwant of knowledge and candour, she protested in the most earnest and\nsolemn manner the pernicious practice of dipping the child--a piece\nof cruelty which, with God's assistance, she should never suffer to\nbe inflicted on her own issue; and washing her hands of the melancholy\nconsequence that would certainly ensue, shut herself up in her closet\nto indulge her sorrow and vexation. She was deceived, however, in her\nprognostic. The boy, instead of declining in point of health, seemed to\nacquire fresh vigour from every plunge, as if he had been resolved to\ndiscredit the wisdom and foresight of his aunt, who in all probability\ncould never forgive him for this want of reverence and respect. This\nconjecture is founded upon her behaviour to him in the sequel of his\ninfancy, during which she was known to torture him more than once, when\nshe had opportunities of thrusting pins into his flesh, without any\ndanger of being detected. In short, her affections were in a little time\naltogether alienated from this hope of her family, whom she abandoned to\nthe conduct of his mother, whose province it undoubtedly was to manage\nthe nurture of her own child; while she herself resumed her operations\nupon the commodore, whom she was resoled at any rate to captivate and\nenslave. And it must be owned that Mrs. Grizzle's knowledge of the human\nheart never shone so conspicuous as in the methods she pursued for the\naccomplishment of this important aim.\n\nThrough the rough unpolished hulk that cased the soul of Trunnion, she\ncould easily distinguish a large share of that vanity and self-conceit\nthat generally predominate even in the most savage beast; and to this\nshe constantly appealed. In his presence she always exclaimed against\nthe craft and dishonest dissimulation of the world, and never failed of\nuttering particular invectives against those arts of chicanery in\nwhich the lawyers are so conversant, to the prejudice and ruin of their\nfellow-creatures; observing that in a seafaring life, as far as she\nhad opportunities of judging or being informed, there was nothing but\nfriendship, sincerity, and a hearty contempt for everything that was\nmean or selfish.\n\nThis kind of conversation, with the assistance of certain particular\ncivilities, insensibly made an impression on the mind of the commodore,\nand the more effectual as his former prepossessions were built upon very\nslender foundations. His antipathy to old maids, which he had conceived\nupon hearsay, began gradually to diminish when he found they were not\nquite such infernal animals as they had been presented; and it was not\nlong before he was heard to observe, at the club, that Pickle's sister\nhad not so much of the core of b-- in her as he had imagined. This\nnegative compliment, by the medium of her brother, soon reached the\nears of Mrs. Grizzle, who, thus encouraged, redoubled in her arts and\nattention; so that, in less than three months after, he in the same\nplace distinguished her with the epithet of a d--d sensible jade.\n\nHatchway, taking the alarm at this declaration, which he feared\nforeboded something fatal to his interest, told his commander, with a\nsneer, that she had sense enough to bring him to under her stern; and he\ndid not doubt but that such an old crazy vessel would be the better for\nbeing taken in tow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut howsomever,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added this arch adviser, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'd have\nyou take care of your upper-works; for if once you are made fast to her\npoop, egad! She'll spank it away, and make every beam in your body crack\nwith straining.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOur she-projector's whole plan had like to have been ruined by the\neffect which this malicious hint had upon Trunnion, whose rage and\nsuspicion being wakened at once, his colour changed from tawny to a\ncadaverous pale, and then shifting to a deep and dusky red, such as we\nsometimes observe in the sky when it is replete with thunder, he, after\nhis usual preamble of unmeaning oaths, answered in these words:--\u00e2\u0080\u009cD--\nyou, you jury-legg'd dog, you would give all the stowage in your hold to\nbe as sound as I am; and as for being taken in tow, d'ye see, I'm not\nso disabled that I can lie my course, and perform my voyage without\nassistance; and, egad! no man shall ever see Hawser Trunnion lagging\nastern, in the wake of e'er a b-- in Christendom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Grizzle, who every morning interrogated her brother with regard to\nthe subject of his night's conversation with his friends, soon received\nthe unwelcome news of the commodore's aversion to matrimony; and justly\nimputing the greatest part of his disgust to the satirical insinuations\nof Mr. Hatchway, resolved to level this obstruction to her success, and\nactually found means to interest him in her scheme. She had indeed, on\nsome occasions, a particular knack at making converts, being probably\nnot unacquainted with that grand system of persuasion which is adopted\nby the greatest personages of the age, and fraught with maxims much\nmore effectual than all the eloquence of Tully or Demosthenes, even\nwhen supported by the demonstrations of truth; besides, Mr. Hatchway's\nfidelity to his new ally was confirmed by his foreseeing, in his\ncaptain's marriage, an infinite fund of gratification for his own\ncynical disposition. Thus, therefore, converted and properly cautioned,\nhe for the future suppressed all the virulence of his wit against the\nmatrimonial state; and as he knew not how to open his mouth in the\npositive praise of any person whatever, took all opportunities of\nexcepting Mrs. Grizzle, by name, from the censures he liberally bestowed\nupon the rest of her sex. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is not a drunkard, like Nan Castick,\nof Deptford,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would say; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot a nincompoop, like Peg Simper, of\nWoolwich; not a brimstone, like Kate Koddle, of Chatham; nor a shrew,\nlike Nell Griffin, on the Point, Portsmouth\u00e2\u0080\u009d (ladies to whom, at\ndifferent times, they had both paid their addresses); \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut a tight,\ngood-humoured, sensible wench, who knows very well how to box her\ncompass; well-trimmed aloft, and well-sheathed alow, with a good cargo\nunder her hatches.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The commodore at first imagined this commendation\nwas ironical; but, hearing it repeated again and again, was filled with\nastonishment at this surprising change in the lieutenant's behaviour;\nand, after a long fit of musing, concluded that Hatchway himself\nharboured a matrimonial design on the person of Mrs. Grizzle.\n\nPleased with this conjecture, he rallied jack in his turn, and one night\ntoasted her health as a compliment to his passion--a circumstance which\nthe lady learned next day by the usual canal of her intelligence;\nand interpreting as the result of his own tenderness for her, she\ncongratulated herself on the victory she had obtained; and thinking\nit unnecessary to continue the reserve she had hitherto industriously\naffected, resolved from that day to sweeten her behaviour towards him\nwith such a dash of affection as could not fail to persuade him that\nhe had inspired her with a reciprocal flame. In consequence of this\ndetermination, he was invited to dinner, and while he stayed treated\nwith such cloying proofs of her regard, that not only the rest of the\ncompany, but even Trunnion perceived her drift; and taking the alarm\naccordingly, could not help exclaiming, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOho! I see how the land lies,\nand if I don't weather the point, I'll be d--d.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Having thus expressed\nhimself to his afflicted inamorata, he made the best of his way to the\ngarrison, in which he shut himself up for the space of ten days, and had\nno communication with his friends and domestics but by looks, which were\nmost significantly picturesque.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\n\nDivers Stratagems are invented and put in practice, in order to overcome\nthe obstinacy of Trunnion, who, at length, is teased and tortured into\nthe Noose of Wedlock.\n\n\nThis abrupt departure and unkind declaration affected Mrs. Grizzle so\nmuch, that she fell sick of sorrow and mortification; and after having\nconfined herself to her bed for three days, sent for her brother, told\nhim she perceived her end drawing near, and desired that a lawyer might\nbe brought, in order to write her last will. Mr. Pickle, surprised at\nher demand, began to act the part of a comforter, assuring her that her\ndistemper was not at all dangerous, and that he would instantly send\nfor a physician, who would convince her that she was in no manner\nof jeopardy; so that there was no occasion at present to employ any\nofficious attorney in such a melancholy task. Indeed, this affectionate\nbrother was of opinion that a will was altogether superfluous at any\nrate, as he himself was heir-in-law to his sister's whole real and\npersonal estate. But she insisted on his compliance with such determined\nobstinacy, that he could no longer resist her importunities; and, a\narriving, she dictated and executed her will, in which she bequeathed\nto Commodore Trunnion one thousand pounds, to purchase a mourning\nring, which she hoped he would wear as a pledge of her friendship and\naffection. Her brother, though he did not much relish this testimony\nof her love, nevertheless that same evening gave an account of this\nparticular to Mr. Hatchway, who was also, as Mr. Pickle assured him,\ngenerously remembered by the testatrix.\n\nThe lieutenant, fraught with this piece of intelligence, watched for\nan opportunity; and as soon as he perceived the commodore's features\na little unbended from that ferocious contraction they had retained so\nlong, ventured to inform him that Pickle's sister lay at the point of\ndeath, and that she had left him a thousand pounds in her will. This\npiece of news overwhelmed him with confusion; and Mr. Hatchway, imputing\nhis silence to remorse, resolved to take advantage of that favourable\nmoment, and counselled him to go and visit the poor young woman, who\nwas dying for love of him. But his admonition happened to be somewhat\nunseasonable. Trunnion no sooner heard him mention the cause of her\ndisorder, than his morosity recurring, he burst out into a violent fit\nof cursing, and forthwith betook himself again to his hammock, where he\nlay, uttering, in a low growling tone of voice, a repetition of oaths\nand imprecations, for the space of four-and-twenty hours, without\nceasing. This was a delicious meal to the lieutenant, who, eager to\nenhance the pleasure of the entertainment, and at the same the conduce\nto the success of the cause he had espoused, invented a stratagem, the\nexecution of which had all the effect he could desire. He prevailed on\nPipes, who was devoted to his service, to get on the top of the chimney,\nbelonging to the commodore's chamber, at midnight, and lower down by\na rope a bunch of stinking whitings, which being performed, he put a\nspeaking-trumpet to his mouth, and hallooed down the vent, in a voice\nlike thunder, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrunnion! Trunnion! turn out and be spliced, or lie still\nand be d--.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis dreadful note, the terror of which was increased by the silence and\ndarkness of the night, as well as the cello of the passage through which\nit was conveyed, no sooner reached the ears of the astonished commodore,\nthan turning his eyes towards the place from whence this solemn address\nseemed to proceed, he beheld a glittering object that vanished in an\ninstant. Just as his superstitious fear had improved the apparition into\nsome supernatural messenger clothed in shining array, his opinion was\nconfirmed by a sudden explosion, which he took for thunder, though it\nwas no other than the noise of a pistol fired down the chimney by the\nboatswain's mate, according to the instructions he had received; and he\nhad time enough to descend before he was in any danger of being detected\nby his commodore, who could not for an hour recollect himself from the\namazement and consternation which had overpowered his faculties.\n\nAt length, however, he got up, and rang his bell with great agitation.\nHe repeated the summons more than once; but no regard being paid to this\nalarm, his dread returned with double terror, a cold sweat bedewed his\nlimbs, his knees knocked together, his hair bristled up, and the remains\nof his teeth were shattered in pieces in the convulsive vibrations of\nhis jaws.\n\nIn the midst of this agony he made one desperate effort, and, bursting\nopen the door of apartment, bolted into Hatchway's chamber, which\nhappened to be on the same floor. There he found the lieutenant in\na counterfeit swoon, who pretended to wake from his trance in an\nejaculation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cLord have mercy upon us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and being questioned by the\nterrified commodore with regard to what had happened, assured him he had\nheard the same voice and clap of thunder by which Trunnion himself had\nbeen discomposed.\n\nPipes, whose turn it was to watch, concurred in giving evidence to the\nsame purpose; and the commodore not only owned that he had heard the\nvoice, but likewise communicated his vision, with all the aggravation\nwhich his disturbed fancy suggested.\n\nA consultation immediately ensued, in which Mr. Hatchway gravely\nobserved that the finger of Heaven was plainly perceivable in those\nsignals, and that it would be both sinful and foolish to disregard its\ncommands, especially as the match proposed was, in all respects, more\nadvantageous than any that one of his years could reasonably expect;\ndeclaring that for his own part he would not endanger his soul and body\nby living one day longer under the same roof with a man who despised the\nwill of Heaven; and Tom Pipes adhered to the same pious resolution.\n\nTrunnion's perseverance could not resist the number and diversity\nof considerations that assaulted it; he revolved in silence all the\nopposite motives that occurred to his reflection; and after having been,\nto all appearance, bewildered in the labyrinth of his own thoughts, he\nwiped the sweat from his forehead, and, heaving a piteous groan, yielded\nto their remonstrances in these words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, since it must be so, I\nthink we must ev'n grapple. But d-- my eyes! 'tis a d--d hard case\nthat a fellow of my years should be compelled, d'ye see, to beat up\nto windward all the rest of my life against the current of my own\ninclination.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis important article being discussed, Mr. Hatchway set out in the\nmorning to visit the despairing shepherdess, and was handsomely rewarded\nfor the enlivening tidings with which he blessed her ears. Sick as\nshe was, she could not help laughing heartily at the contrivance, in\nconsequence of which her swain's assent had been obtained, and gave the\nlieutenant ten guineas for Tom Pipes, in consideration of the part he\nacted in the farce.\n\nIn the afternoon the commodore suffered himself to be conveyed to her\napartment, like a felon to execution, and was received by her in\na languishing manner, and genteel dishabille, accompanied by her\nsister-in-law, who was, for very obvious reasons, extremely solicitous\nabout her success. Though the lieutenant had tutored him touching his\nbehaviour it this interview, he made a thousand wry faces before he\ncould pronounce the simple salutation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow d'ye?\u00e2\u0080\u009d to his mistress;\nand after his counsellor had urged him with twenty or thirty whispers,\nto each of which he had replied aloud, \u00e2\u0080\u009cD-- your eyes, I won't,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he got\nup, and halting towards the couch on which Mrs. Grizzle reclined in a\nstate of strange expectation, he seized her hand and pressed it to his\nlips; but this piece of gallantry he performed in such a reluctant,\nuncouth, indignant manner, that the nymph had need of all her resolution\nto endure the compliment without shrinking; and he himself was so\ndisconcerted at what he had done, that he instantly retired to the\nother end of the room, where he sat silent, and broiled with shame and\nvexation.\n\nMrs. Pickle, like a sensible matron, quitted the place, on pretence of\ngoing to the nursery; and Mr. Hatchway, taking the hint, recollected\nthat he had left his tobacco-pouch in the parlour, whither he descended,\nleaving the two lovers to their mutual endearments. Never had the\ncommodore found himself in such a disagreeable dilemma before. He sat in\nan agony of suspense, as if he every moment dreaded the dissolution of\nnature; and the imploring sighs of his future bride added, if possible,\nto the pangs of his distress. Impatient of this situation, he rolled\nhis eye around in quest of some relief, and, unable to contain himself,\nexclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--n seize the fellow and his pouch too! I believe he has\nsheered off, and left me here in the stays.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Grizzle, who could not help taking some notice of this\nmanifestation of chagrin, lamented her unhappy fate in being so\ndisagreeable to him, that he could not put up with her company for a few\nmoments without repining; and began in very tender terms to reproach him\nwith his inhumanity and indifference. To this expostulation he replied,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cZounds! what would the woman have? Let the parson do his office when he\nwool: here I am ready to be reeved in the matrimonial block, d'ye see,\nand d-- all nonsensical palaver.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he retreated, leaving his\nmistress not at all disobliged at his plain dealing. That same evening\nthe treaty of marriage was brought upon the carpet, and, by means of Mr.\nPickle and the lieutenant, settled to the satisfaction of all parties,\nwithout the intervention of lawyers, whom Mr. Trunnion expressly\nexcluded from all share in the business; making that condition the\nindispensable preliminary of the whole agreement. Things being brought\nto this bearing, Mrs. Grizzle's heart dilated with joy; her health,\nwhich, by the bye, was never dangerously impaired, she recovered as if\nby enchantment; and, a day being fixed for the nuptials, employed the\nshort period of her celibacy in choosing ornaments for the celebration\nof her entrance into the married state.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\n\nPreparations are made for the Commodore's Wedding, which is delayed by\nan Accident that hurried him the Lord knows whither.\n\n\nThe fame of this extraordinary conjunction spread all over the county;\nand, on the day appointed for their spousals, the church was surrounded\nby an inconceivable multitude. The commodore, to give a specimen of his\ngallantry, by the advice of his friend Hatchway, resolved to appear on\nhorseback on the grand occasion, at the head of all his male attendants,\nwhom he had rigged with the white shirts and black caps formerly\nbelonging to his barge's crew; and he bought a couple of hunters for the\naccommodation of himself and his lieutenant. With this equipage, then,\nhe set out from the garrison for the church, after having despatched a\nmessenger to apprise the bride that he and his company were mounted. She\ngot immediately into the coach, accompanied by her brother and his wife,\nand drove directly to the place of assignation, where several pews were\ndemolished, and divers persons almost pressed to death, by the eagerness\nof the crowd that broke in to see the ceremony performed. Thus arrived\nat the altar, and the priest in attendance, they waited a whole\nhalf-hour for the commodore, at whose slowness they began to be under\nsome apprehension, and accordingly dismissed a servant to quicken his\npace. The valet having ridden something more than a mile, espied the\nwhole troop disposed in a long field, crossing the road obliquely, and\nheaded by the bridegroom and his friend Hatchway, who, finding himself\nhindered by a hedge from proceeding farther in the same direction, fired\na pistol, and stood over to the other side, making an obtuse angle with\nthe line of his former course; and the rest of the squadron followed his\nexample, keeping always in the rear of each other, like a flight of wild\ngeese.\n\nSurprised at this strange method of journeying, the messenger came up,\nand told the commodore that his lady and her company expected him in the\nchurch, where they had tarried a considerable time, and were beginning\nto be very uneasy at his delay, and therefore desired he would proceed\nwith more expedition. To this message Mr. Trunnion replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHark ye,\nbrother, don't you see we make all possible speed? go back, and tell\nthose who sent you, that the wind has shifted since we weighed anchor,\nand that we are obliged to make very short trips in tacking, by reason\nof the narrowness of the channel; and that as we be within six points\nof the wind, they must make some allowance for variation and\nleeway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord, sir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the valet, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat occasion have you to go\nzig-zag in that manner? Do but clap spurs to your horses, and ride\nstraight forward, and I'll engage yea shall be at the church-porch\nin less than a quarter of an hour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat? right in the wind's eye?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered the commodore; \u00e2\u0080\u009cahey! brother, where did you learn your\nnavigation? Hawser Trunnion is not to be taught at this time of day how\nto lie his course, or keep his own reckoning. And as for you, brother,\nyou best know the trim of your own frigate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe courier, finding he had to do with people who would not be easily\npersuaded out of their own opinions, returned to the temple, and made a\nreport of what he had seen and heard, to the no small consolation of\nthe bride, who had begun to discover some signs of disquiet. Composed,\nhowever, by this piece of intelligence, she exerted her patience for the\nspace of another half-hour, during which period, seeing no bridegroom\narrive, she was exceedingly alarmed; so that all the spectators could\neasily perceive her perturbation, which manifested itself in frequent\npalpitations, heart-heavings, and alterations of countenance, in spite\nof the assistance of a smelling-bottle which she incessantly applied to\nher nostrils.\n\nVarious were the conjectures of the company on this occasion: some\nimagined he had mistaken the place of rendezvous, as he had never been\nat church since he first settled in that parish; others believed he\nhad met with some accident, in consequence of which his attendants had\ncarried him back to his own house; and a third set, in which the bride\nherself was thought to be comprehended, could not help suspecting\nthat the commodore had changed his mind. But all these suppositions,\ningenious as they were, happened to be wide of the true cause that\ndetained him, which was no other than this: the commodore and his crew\nhad, by dint of turning, almost weathered the parson's house that stood\nto windward of the church, when the notes of a pack of hounds unluckily\nreached the ears of the two hunters which Trunnion and the lieutenant\nbestrode. These fleet animals no sooner heard the enlivening sound,\nthan, eager for the chase, they sprang away all of a sudden, and\nstrained every nerve to partake of the sport, flew across the fields\nwith incredible speed, overleaped hedges and ditches, and everything\nin their way, without the least regard to their unfortunate riders. The\nlieutenant, whose steed had got the heels of the other, finding it would\nbe great folly and presumption in him to pretend to keep the saddle with\nhis wooden leg, very wisely took the opportunity of throwing himself off\nin his passage through a field of rich clover, among which he lay at his\nease; and seeing his captain advancing, at full gallop, hailed him with\nthe salutation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat cheer? Ho!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The commodore, who was in infinite\ndistress, eyeing him askance as he passed, replied, with a faltering\nvoice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cO, d-- ye!--you are safe at an anchor. I wish to God I were as\nfast moored.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNevertheless, conscious of his disabled heel, he would not venture\nto try the experiment which had succeeded so well with Hatchway but\nresolved to stick as close as possible to his horse's back, until\nProvidence should interpose in his behalf. With this view he dropped his\nwhip, and with his right hand laid fast hold on the pommel, contracting\nevery muscle in his body to secure himself in the seat, and grinning\nmost formidably in consequence of this exertion. In this attitude he\nwas hurried on a considerable way, when all of a sudden his view was\ncomforted by a five-bar gate that appeared before him, as he never\ndoubted that there the career of his hunter must necessarily end.\nBut, alas! he reckoned without his host. Far from halting at this\nobstruction, the horse sprang over it with amazing agility, to the utter\nconfusion and disorder of his owner, who lost his hat and periwig in\nthe leap, and now began to think, in good earnest, that he was actually\nmounted on the back of the devil. He recommended himself to God; his\nreflections forsook him; his eyesight and all his other senses failed;\nhe quitted the reins, and fastening by instinct on the mane, was in this\ncondition conveyed into the midst of the sportsmen, who were astonished\nat the sight of such an apparition. Neither was their surprise to be\nwondered at, if we reflect on the figure that presented itself to their\nview. The commodore's person was at all times an object of admiration;\nmuch more so on this occasion, when every singularity was aggravated by\nthe circumstances of his dress and disaster.\n\nHe had put on, in honour of his nuptials, his best coat of blue\nbroad-cloth, cut by a tailor of Ramsgate, and trimmed with five dozen\nof brass buttons large and small; his breeches were of the same piece,\nfastened at the knees with large bunches of tape; his waistcoat was of\nred plush lappelled with green velvet, and garnished with vellum holes;\nhis boots bore an infinite resemblance, both in colour and shape, to a\npair of leather buckets; his shoulder was graced with a broad buff belt,\nfrom whence depended a huge hanger with a hilt like that of a backsword;\nand on each side of his pommel appeared a rusty pistol rammed in a case\ncovered with a bearskin. The loss of his tie-periwig and laced hat,\nwhich were curiosities of the kind, did not at all contribute to the\nimprovement of the picture, but, on the contrary, by exhibiting his\nbald pate, and the natural extension of his lantern jaws, added to the\npeculiarity and extravagance of the whole.\n\nSuch a spectacle could not have failed of diverting the whole company\nfrom the chase had his horse thought proper to pursue a different route;\nbut the beast was too keen a sporter to choose any other way than that\nwhich the stag followed and therefore, without stopping to gratify\nthe curiosity of the spectators, he in a few minutes outstripped every\nhunter in the field. There being a deep hollow betwixt him and the\nhounds, rather than ride round, about the length of a furlong, in a\npath that crossed the lane, he transported himself at one jump, to the\nunspeakable astonishment and terror of a waggoner who chanced to be\nunderneath, and saw this phenomenon fly over his carriage. This was not\nthe only adventure he achieved. The stag, having taken a deep river\nthat lay in his way, every man directed his course to a bridge in\nthe neighbourhood; but our bridegroom's courser, despising all such\nconveniences, plunged into the stream without hesitation, and swam in a\ntwinkling to the opposite shore. This sudden immersion into an element\nof which Trunnion was properly a native, in all probability helped to\nrecruit the exhausted spirits of his rider, at his landing on the other\nside gave some tokens of sensation, by hallooing aloud for assistance,\nwhich he could not possibly receive, because his horse still maintained\nthe advantage he had gained, and would not allow himself to be\novertaken.\n\nIn short, after a long chase that lasted several hours, and extended to\na dozen miles at least, he was the first in at the death of the deer,\nbeing seconded by the lieutenant's gelding, which, actuated by the same\nspirit, had, without a rider, followed his companion's example.\n\nOur bridegroom, finding himself at last brought up, or, in other words,\nat the end of his career, took the opportunity of this first pause, to\ndesire the huntsmen would lend him a hand in dismounting; and by their\ncondescension, safely placed on the grass, where he sat staring at\nthe company as they came in, with such wildness of astonishment in his\nlooks, as if he had been a creature of another species, dropped among\nthem from the clouds.\n\nBefore they had fleshed the hounds, however, he recollected himself;\nand, seeing one of the sportsmen take a small flask out of his pocket\nand apply it to his mouth, judged the cordial to be no other than neat\nCognac, which it really was; and expressing a desire of participation,\nwas immediately accommodated with a moderate dose, which perfectly\ncompleted his recovery.\n\nBy this time he and his two horses had engrossed the attention of the\nwhole crowd: while some admired the elegant proportion and uncommon\nspirit of the two animals, the rest contemplated the surprising\nappearance of their master, whom before they had only seen en passant;\nand at length, one of the gentlemen, accosting him very courteously,\nsignified his wonder at seeing him in such an equipage, and asked if\nhe had not dropped his companion by the way. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy look ye, brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n replied the commodore, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmayhap you think me an odd sort of a fellow,\nseeing me in this trim, especially as I have lost part of my rigging;\nbut this here is the case, d'ye see: I weighed anchor from my own house\nthis morning, at ten A.M. with fair weather, and a favourable breeze\nat south-south-east, being bound to the next church on the voyage of\nmatrimony: but howsomever, we had not run down a quarter of a league,\nwhen the wind shifting, blowed directly in our teeth; so that we were\nforced to tack all the way, d'ye see, and had almost been up within\nsight of the port, when these sons-of-b--s of horses, which I had\nbought but two days before (for my own part, I believe they are devils\nincarnate), luffed round in a trice, and then, refusing the helm, drove\naway like lightning with me and my lieutenant, who soon came to anchor\nin an exceeding good berth. As for my own part, I have been carried over\nrocks, and quicksands; among which I have pitched away a special good\ntie-periwig, and an iron-bound hat; and at last, thank God! am got into\nsmooth water and safe riding; but if ever I venture my carcass upon such\na hare'um scare'um blood-of-a-b-- again, my name is not Hawser Trunnion,\nd-- my eyes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOne of the company, struck with this name, which he had often heard,\nimmediately laid hold on his declaration at the close of this singular\naccount, and, observing that his horses were very vicious, asked how he\nintended to return. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs for that matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Mr. Trunnion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am\nresolved to hire a sledge or waggon, or such a thing as a jackass; for\nI'll be d--d if ever I cross the back of a horse again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what do\nyou propose to do with these creatures?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other, pointing to the\nhunters; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey seem to have some mettle; but then they are mere colts,\nand will take the devil-and-all of breaking: methinks this hinder one is\nshoulder-slipped.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cD-- them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the commodore, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish both their\nnecks were broke, thof the two cost me forty good yellow-boys.\u00e2\u0080\u009d.-\u00e2\u0080\u009cForty\nguineas!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the stranger, who was a squire and a jockey, as well\nas owner of the pack, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLord! Lord! how a man may be imposed upon!\nWhy, these cattle are clumsy enough to go to plough; mind what a flat\ncounter; do but observe how sharp this here one is in the withers;\nthen he's fired in the further fetlock.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In short, this connoisseur\nin horse-flesh, having discovered in them all the defects which can\npossibly be found in this species of animal, offered to give him ten\nguineas for the two, saying he would convert them into beasts of burden.\nThe owner, who, after what had happened, was very well disposed to\nlisten to anything that was said to their prejudice, implicitly believed\nthe truth of the stranger's asseverations, discharged a furious volley\nof oaths against the rascal who had taken him in, and forthwith struck\na bargain with the squire, who paid him instantly for his purchase; in\nconsequence of which he won the plate at the next Canterbury races.\n\nThis affair being transacted to the mutual satisfaction of both parties,\nas well as to the general entertainment of the company, who laughed in\ntheir sleeves at the dexterity of their friend, Trunnion was set upon\nthe squire's own horse, and led by his servant in the midst of this\ncavalcade, which proceeded to a neighbouring village, where they had\nbespoke dinner, and where our bridegroom found means to provide himself\nwith another hat and wig. With regard to his marriage, he bore his\ndisappointment with the temper of a philosopher; and the exercise he had\nundergone having quickened his appetite, sat down at table in the midst\nof his new acquaintance, making a very hearty meal, and moistening\nevery morsel with a draught of the ale, which he found very much to his\nsatisfaction.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\n\nHe is found by Lieutenant--Reconducted to his own House--Married to Mrs.\nGrizzle, who meets with a small misfortune in the Night, and asserts her\nPrerogative next Morning, in consequence of which her Husband's Eye is\nendangered.\n\n\nMeanwhile Lieutenant Hatchway made shift to hobble to the church, where\nhe informed the company of what had happened to the commodore: and the\nbride behaved with great decency on the occasion; for, as she understood\nthe danger to which her future husband was exposed, she fainted in the\narms of her sister-in-law, to the surprise of all the spectators,\nwho could not comprehend the cause of her disorder; and when she was\nrecovered by the application of smelling-bottles, earnestly begged that\nMr. Hatchway and Tom Pipes should take her brother's coach, and go in\nquest of their commander.\n\nThis task they readily undertook, being escorted by all the rest of his\nadherents on horseback; while the bride and her friends were invited to\nthe parson's horse, and the ceremony deferred till another occasion.\n\nThe lieutenant, steering his course as near the line of direction\nin which Trunnion went off, as the coach-road would permit, got\nintelligence of his track from one farm-house to another; for such an\napparition could not fail of attracting particular notice; and one of\nthe horsemen having picked up his hat and wig in a by-path, the whole\ntroop entered the village where he was lodged, about four o'clock in the\nafternoon. When they understood he was safely housed at the George, they\nrode up to the door in a body, and expressed their satisfaction in three\ncheers; which were returned by the company within, as soon as they were\ninstructed in the nature of the salute by Trunnion, who, by this time,\nhad entered into all the jollity of his new friends, and was indeed more\nthan half-seas-over. The lieutenant was introduced to all present as his\nsworn brother, and had something tossed up for his dinner. Tom Pipes and\nthe crew were regaled in another room; and, a fresh pair of horses being\nput to the coach, about six in the evening the commodore, with all his\nattendants, departed for the garrison, after having shook hands with\nevery individual in the house.\n\nWithout any further accident, he was conveyed in safety to his own\ngate before nine, and committed to the care of Pipes, who carried him\ninstantly to his hammock, while the lieutenant was driven away to the\nplace where the bride and her friends remained in great anxiety,\nwhich vanished when he assured them that his commodore was safe, being\nsucceeded by abundance of mirth and pleasantry at the account he gave of\nTrunnion's adventure.\n\nAnother day was fixed for the nuptials; and in order to balk the\ncuriosity of idle people, which had given great offence, the parson was\nprevailed upon to perform the ceremony in the garrison, which all\nthat day was adorned with flags and pendants displayed; and at night\nilluminated, by the direction of Hatchway, who also ordered the\npatereroes to be fired, as soon as the marriage-knot was tied. Neither\nwere the other parts of the entertainment neglected by this ingenious\ncontriver, who produced undeniable proofs of his elegance and art in\nthe wedding-supper, which had been committed to his management and\ndirection. This genial banquet was entirely composed of sea-dishes; a\nhuge pillaw, consisting of a large piece of beef sliced, a couple of\nfowls, and half a peck of rice, smoked in the middle of the board: a\ndish of hard fish, swimming in oil, appeared at each end; the sides\nbeing furnished with a mess of that savoury composition known by the\nname of lub's-course, and a plate of salmagundy. The second course\ndisplayed a goose of a monstrous magnitude, flanked with two\nGuinea-hens, a pig barbacued, a hock of salt pork, in the midst of\na pease-pudding, a leg of mutton roasted, with potatoes, and another\nboiled, with yams. The third service was made up of a loin of fresh\npork, with apple-sauce, a kid smothered with onions, and a terrapin\nbaked in the shell; and last of all, a prodigious sea-pie was presented,\nwith an infinite volume of pancakes and fritters. That everything\nmight be answerable to the magnificence of this delicate feast, he had\nprovided vast quantifies of strong beer, flip, rumbo, and burnt brandy,\nwith plenty of Barbadoes water for the ladies; and hired all the fiddles\nwithin six miles, which, with the addition of a drum, bagpipe, and Welsh\nharp, regaled the guests with a most melodious concert.\n\nThe company, who were not at all exceptions, seemed extremely well\npleased with every particular of the entertainment; and the evening\nbeing spent in the most social manner, the bride was by her sister\nconducted to her apartment, where, however, a trifling circumstance had\nlike to have destroyed the harmony which had been hitherto maintained.\n\nI have already observed, that there was not one standing bed within the\nwalls; therefore the reader will not wonder that Mrs. Trunnion was out\nof humour, when she found herself under the necessity of being confined\nwith her spouse in a hammock, which, though enlarged with a double\nportion of canvas, and dilated with a yoke for the occasion, was at\nbest but a disagreeable, not to say dangerous situation. She accordingly\ncomplained with some warmth of this inconvenience, which she imputed\nto disrespect; and, at first, absolutely refused to put up with the\nexpedient; but Mrs. Pickle soon brought her to reason and compliance,\nby observing that one night will soon be elapsed, and next day she might\nregulate her own economy.\n\nThus persuaded, she ventured into the vehicle, and was visited by her\nhusband in less than an hour, the company being departed to their own\nhomes, and the garrison left to the command of his lieutenant and mate.\nBut it seems the hooks that supported this swinging couch were not\ncalculated for the addition of weight which they were now destined to\nbear; and therefore gave way in the middle of the night, to the no small\nterror of Mrs. Trunnion, who perceiving herself falling, screamed aloud,\nand by that exclamation brought Hatchway with a light into the chamber.\nThough she had received no injury by the fall, she was extremely\ndiscomposed and incensed at the accident, which she even openly ascribed\nto the obstinacy and whimsical oddity of the commodore, in such petulant\nterms as evidently declared that she thought her great aim accomplished,\nand her authority secured against all the shocks of fortune. Indeed her\nbedfellow seemed to be of the same opinion, by his tacit resignation;\nfor he made no reply to her insinuations, but with a most vinegar\naspect crawled out of his nest, and betook himself to rest in another\napartment; while his irritated spouse dismissed the lieutenant, and\nfrom the wreck of the hammock made an occasional bed for herself on the\nfloor, fully determined to provide better accommodation for the next\nnight's lodging.\n\nHaving no inclination to sleep, her thoughts, during the remaining part\nof the night, were engrossed by a scheme of reformation she was\nresolved to execute in the family; and no sooner did the first lark\nbid salutation to the morn, than, starting from her humble couch, and\nhuddling on her clothes, she sallied from her chamber, explored her\nway through paths before unknown, and in the course of her researches\nperceived a large bell, to which she made such effectual application\nas alarmed every soul in the family. In a moment she was surrounded\nby Hatchway, Pipes, and all the rest of the servants half-dressed; but\nseeing none of the feminine gender appear, she began to storm at the\nsloth and laziness of the maids, who, she observed, ought to have been\nat work an hour at least before she called; and then, for the first\ntime, understood that no woman was permitted to sleep within the walls.\n\nShe did not fail to exclaim against this regulation; and being informed\nthat the cook and chambermaid lodged in a small office-house that stood\nwithout the gate, ordered the drawbridge to be let down, and in person\nbeat up their quarters, commanding them forthwith to set about scouring\nthe rooms, which had not been hitherto kept in a very decent condition,\nwhile two men were immediately employed to transport the bed on which\nshe used to lie from her brother's house to her new habitation; so that,\nin less than two hours, the whole economy of the garrison was turned\ntopsy-turvy, and everything involved in tumult and noise. Trunnion,\nbeing disturbed and distracted with the uproar, turned out in his shirt\nlike a maniac, and, arming himself with a cudgel of crab-tree, made\nan irruption into his wife's apartment, where, perceiving a couple of\ncarpenters at work in joining a bedstead, he, with many dreadful oaths\nand opprobrious invectives, ordered them to desist, swearing he would\nsuffer no bulkheads nor hurricane-houses to stand where he was master:\nbut finding his remonstrances disregarded by these mechanics, who\nbelieved him to be some madman belonging to the family, who had broken\nfrom his confinement, he assaulted them both with great fury and\nindignation, and was handled so roughly, in the encounter, that in a\nvery short time he measured his length on the floor, in consequence of a\nblow that he received from a hammer by which the sight of his remaining\neye was grievously endangered.\n\nHaving thus reduced him to a state of subjection, they resolved to\nsecure him with cords, and were actually busy in adjusting his fetters,\nwhen he was exempted from the disgrace by the accidental entrance of his\nspouse, who rescued him from the hands of his adversaries, and, in the\nmidst of her condolence, imputed his misfortune to the inconsiderate\nroughness of his own disposition.\n\nHe breathed nothing but revenge, and made some efforts to chastise the\ninsolence of the workmen, who, as soon as they understood his quality,\nasked forgiveness for what they had done with great humility, protesting\nthat they did not know he was master of the house. But, far from\nbeing satisfied with this apology, he groped about for the bell, the\ninflammation of his eye having utterly deprived him of sight; and the\nrope being, by the precaution of the delinquents, conveyed out of his\nreach, began to storm with incredible vociferation, like a lion roaring\nin the toil, pouring forth innumerable oaths and execrations, and\ncalling by name Hatchway and Pipes, who, being within hearing, obeyed\nthe extraordinary summons, and were ordered to put the carpenters in\nirons, for having audaciously assaulted him in his own house.\n\nHis myrmidons, seeing he had been evil-treated, were exasperated at the\ninsult he had suffered, which they considered as an affront upon the\ndignity of the garrison; the more so as the mutineers seemed to put\nthemselves in a posture of defence and set their authority at defiance;\nthey therefore unsheathed their cutlasses, which they commonly wore\nas badges of their commission; and a desperate engagement in all\nprobability would have ensued, had not the lady of the castle\ninterposed, and prevented the effects of their animosity, by assuring\nthe lieutenant that the commodore had been the aggressor, and that the\nworkmen, finding themselves attacked in such an extraordinary manner,\nby a person whom they did not know, were obliged to act in their own\ndefence, by which he had received that unlucky contusion.\n\nMr. Hatchway no sooner learnt the sentiments of Mrs. Trunnion, than,\nsheathing his indignation, he told the commodore he should always\nbe ready to execute his lawful commands; but that he could not in\nconscience be concerned in oppressing poor people who had been guilty of\nno offence.\n\nThis unexpected declaration, together with the behaviour of his wife,\nwho in his hearing desired the carpenters to resume their work, filled\nthe breast of Trunnion with rage and mortification. He pulled off his\nwoollen night-cap, pummeled his bare pate, beat the floor alternately\nwith his feet, swore his people had betrayed him, and cursed himself to\nthe lowest pit of hell for having admitted such a cockatrice into his\nfamily. But all these exclamations did not avail; they were among the\nlast essays of his resistance to the will of his wife, whose influence\namong his adherents had already swallowed up his own, and peremptorily\ntold him that he must leave the management of everything within-doors to\nher, who understood best what was for his honour and advantage. She then\nordered a poultice to be prepared for his eye, which being applied, he\nwas committed to the care of Pipes, by whom he was led about the house\nlike a blind bear growling for prey, while his industrious yoke-fellow\nexecuted every circumstance of the plan she had projected; so that when\nhe recovered his vision he was an utter stranger in his own house.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\n\nThe Commodore being in some cases restive, his Lady has recourse to\nArtifice in the Establishment of her Throne--She exhibits Symptoms of\nPregnancy, to the unspeakable joy of Trunnion, who, nevertheless, is\nbalked in his expectation.\n\n\nThese innovations were not effected without many loud objections on\nhis part; and divers curious dialogues passed between him and his\nyoke-fellow, who always came off victorious from the dispute; insomuch,\nthat his countenance gradually fell: he began to suppress, and at length\nentirely devoured, his chagrin; the terrors of superior authority were\nplainly perceivable in his features; and in less than three months\nhe became a thorough-paced husband. Not that his obstinacy was\nextinguished, though overcome. In some things he was as inflexible and\nmulish as ever; but then he durst not kick so openly, and was reduced\nto the necessity of being passive in his resentments. Mrs. Trunnion, for\nexample, proposed that a coach and six should be purchased, as she could\nnot ride on horseback, and the chaise was a scandalous carriage for a\nperson of her condition. The commodore, conscious of his own inferior\ncapacity in point of reasoning, did not think proper to dispute the\nproposal but lent a deaf ear to her repeated remonstrances, though\nthey were enforced with every argument which she thought could soothe,\nterrify, shame or decoy him into compliance. In vain did she urge\nthe excess of affection she had for him as meriting some return of\ntenderness and condescension: he was even proof against certain menacing\nhints she gave touching the resentment of a slighted woman; and he stood\nout against all the considerations of dignity or disgrace like a bulwark\nof brass. Neither was he moved to any indecent or unkind expressions of\ncontradiction, even when she upbraided him with his sordid disposition,\nand put him in mind of the fortune and honour he had acquired by his\nmarriage, but seemed to retire within himself, like a tortoise when\nattacked, that shrinks within its shell, and silently endured the\nscourge of her reproaches, without seeming sensible of the smart.\n\nThis, however, was the only point in which she had been baffled since\nher nuptials; and as she could by no means digest the miscarriage, she\ntortured her invention for some new plan by which she might augment\nher influence and authority. What her genius refused was supplied by\naccident; for she had not lived four months in the garrison, when\nshe was seized with frequent qualms and retchings; in a word, she\ncongratulated herself on the symptoms of her own fertility; and the\ncommodore was transported with joy at the prospect of an heir of his own\nbegetting.\n\nShe knew this was the proper season for vindicating her own sovereignty,\nand accordingly employed the means which nature had put in her power.\nThere was not a rare piece of furniture or apparel for which she did not\nlong; and one day, as she went to church, seeing Lady Stately's equipage\narrive, she suddenly fainted away. Her husband, whose vanity had never\nbeen so perfectly gratified as with this promised harvest of his own\nsowing, took the alarm immediately; and in order to prevent relapses of\nthat kind, which might be attended with fatal consequence to his hope,\ngave her leave to bespeak a coach, horses, and liveries, to her own\nliking. Thus authorized, she in a very little time exhibited such a\nspecimen of her own taste and magnificence as afforded speculation to\nthe whole country, and made Trunnion's heart quake within him; because\nhe foresaw no limits to her extravagance which also manifested itself in\nthe most expensive preparations for her lying-in.\n\nHer pride, which had hitherto regarded the representative of her\nfather's house, seemed now to lose all that hereditary respect, and\nprompt her to outshine and undervalue the elder branch of her family.\nShe behaved to Mrs. Pickle with a sort of civil reserve that implied a\nconscious superiority; and an emulation in point of grandeur immediately\ncommenced between the two sisters. She every day communicated her\nimportance to the whole parish, under pretence of taking the air in\nher coach, and endeavoured to extend her acquaintance among people of\nfashion. Nor was this an undertaking attended with great difficulty, for\nall persons whatever capable of maintaining a certain appearance, will\nalways find admission into what is called the best company, and be\nrated in point of character according to their own valuation, without\nsubjecting their pretensions to the smallest doubt or examination. In\nall her visits and parties she seized every opportunity of declaring her\npresent condition, observing that she was forbid by her physicians to\ntaste such a pickle, and that such a dish was poison to a woman in her\nway; nay, where she was on a footing of familiarity, she affected to\nmake wry faces, and complained that the young rogue began to be very\nunruly, writhing herself into divers contortions, as if she had been\ngrievously incommoded by the mettle of this future Trunnion. The husband\nhimself did not behave with all the moderation that might have been\nexpected. At the club he frequently mentioned this circumstance of his\nown vigour as a pretty successful feat to be performed by an old fellow\nof fifty-five, and confirmed the opinion of his strength by redoubled\nsqueezes of the landlord's hand, which never failed of extorting a\nsatisfactory certificate of his might. When his companions drank to the\nHans en kelder, or Jack in the low cellar, he could not help displaying\nan extraordinary complacence of countenance, and signified his intention\nof sending the young dog to sea as soon as he should be able to carry a\ncartridge, in hopes of seeing him an officer before his own death.\n\nThis hope helped to console him under the extraordinary expense to\nwhich he was exposed by the profusion of his wife, especially when he\nconsidered that his compliance with her prodigality would be limited to\nthe expiration of the nine months, of which the best part was by this\ntime elapsed: yet, in spite of all this philosophical resignation, her\nfancy sometimes soared to such a ridiculous and intolerable pitch of\ninsolence and absurdity, that his temper forsook him, and he could\nnot help wishing in secret that her pride might be confounded in the\ndissipation of her most flattering hopes, even though he himself should\nbe a principal sufferer by the disappointment. These, however, were no\nother than the suggestions of temporary disgusts, that commonly subsided\nas suddenly as they arose, and never gave the least disturbance to the\nperson who inspired them, because he took care to conceal them carefully\nfrom her knowledge.\n\nMeanwhile she happily advanced in her reckoning, with the promise of a\nfavourable issue: the term of her computation expired, and in the middle\nof the night she was visited by certain warnings that seemed to bespeak\nthe approach of the critical moment. The commodore got up with great\nalacrity, and called the midwife, who had been several days in the\nhouse; the gossips were immediately summoned, and the most interesting\nexpectations prevailed; but the symptoms of labour gradually vanished,\nand as the matrons sagely observed, this was no more than a false alarm.\n\nTwo nights after they received a second intimation, and as she was\nsensibly diminished in the waist, everything was supposed to be in a\nfair way; yet this visitation was not more conclusive than the former;\nher pains wore off in spite of all her endeavours to encourage them,\nand the good women betook themselves to their respective homes, in\nexpectation of finding the third attack decisive, alluding to the\nwell-known maxim, that \u00e2\u0080\u009cnumber three is always fortunate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For once,\nhowever, this apophthegm failed; the next call was altogether as\nineffectual as the former; and moreover, attended with a phenomenon\nwhich to them was equally strange and inexplicable: this was no other\nthan such a reduction in the size of Mrs. Trunnion as might have been\nexpected after the birth of a full-grown child. Startled at such an\nunaccountable event, they sat in close divan; and concluding that\nthe case was in all respects unnatural and prodigious, desired that a\nmessenger might be immediately despatched for some male practitioner in\nthe art of midwifery.\n\nThe commodore, without guessing the cause of her perplexity, ordered\nPipes immediately on this piece of duty, and in less than two hours\nthey were assisted by the advice of a surgeon of the neighbourhood,\nwho boldly affirmed that the patient had never been with child. This\nasseveration was like a clap of thunder to Mr. Trunnion, who had been,\nduring eight whole days and nights, in continual expectation of being\nhailed with the appellation of father.\n\nAfter some recollection, he swore the surgeon was an ignorant fellow,\nand that he would not take his word for what he advanced, being\ncomforted and confirmed in his want of faith by the insinuations of\nthe midwife, who still persisted to feed Mrs. Trunnion with hopes of a\nspeedy and safe delivery; observing that she had been concerned in many\na case of the same nature, where a fine child was found, even after all\nsigns of the mother's pregnancy had disappeared. Every twig of hope, how\nslender soever it may be, is eagerly caught hold on by people who find\nthemselves in danger of being disappointed. To every question proposed\nby her to the lady, with the preambles of \u00e2\u0080\u009cHan't you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon't you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answer was made in the affirmative, whether agreeable to truth or not,\nbecause the respondent could not find in her heart to disown any symptom\nthat might favour the notion she had so long indulged.\n\nThis experienced proficient in the obstetric art was therefore kept in\nclose attendance for the space of three weeks, during which the patient\nhad several returns of what she pleased herself with believing to be\nlabour pains, till at length, she and her husband became the standing\njoke of the parish; and this infatuated couple could scarce be prevailed\nupon to part with their hope, even when she appeared as lank as a\ngreyhound, and they were furnished with other unquestionable proofs of\ntheir having been deceived. But they could not for ever remain under\nthe influence of this sweet delusion, which at last faded away, and was\nsucceeded by a paroxysm of shame and confusion, that kept the husband\nwithin-doors for the space of a whole fortnight, and confined his lady\nto her bed for a series of weeks, during which she suffered all the\nanguish of the most intense mortification; yet even this was subdued by\nthe lenient hand of time.\n\nThe first respite from her chagrin was employed in the strict discharge\nof what are called the duties of religion, which she performed with\nthe most rancorous severity, setting on foot a persecution in her own\nfamily, that made the house too hot for all the menial servants, even\nruffled the almost invincible indifference of Tom Pipes, harassed the\ncommodore himself out of all patience, and spared no individual but\nLieutenant Hatchway, whom she never ventured to disoblige.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\n\nMrs. Trunnion erects a Tyranny in the Garrison, while her Husband\nconceives an affection for his Nephew Perry, who manifests a peculiarity\nof disposition even in his tender years.\n\n\nHaving exercised herself three months in such pious amusements, she\nappeared again in the world; but her misfortune had made such an\nimpression on her mind, that she could not bear the sight of a child,\nand trembled whenever conversation happened to turn upon a christening.\nHer temper, which was naturally none of the sweetest, seemed to have\nimbibed a double proportion of souring from her disappointment; of\nconsequence, her company was not much coveted, and she found very few\npeople disposed to treat her with those marks of consideration which she\nlooked upon as her due. This neglect detached her from the society of an\nunmannerly world; she concentrated the energy of all her talents in\nthe government of her own house, which groaned accordingly under her\narbitrary sway; and in the brandy-bottle found ample consolation for all\nthe affliction she had undergone.\n\nAs for the commodore, he in a little time weathered his disgrace, after\nhaving sustained many severe jokes from the lieutenant, and now his\nchief aim being to be absent from his own house as much as possible, he\nfrequented the public-house more than ever, more assiduously cultivated\nthe friendship of his brother-in-law, Mr. Pickle, and in the course of\ntheir intimacy conceived an affection for his nephew Perry, which did\nnot end but with his life. Indeed it must be owned that Trunnion was\nnot naturally deficient in the social passions of the soul, which though\nthey were strangely warped, disguised, and overborne by the circumstance\nof his boisterous life and education, did not fail to manifest\nthemselves occasionally through the whole course of his behaviour.\n\nAs all the hopes of propagating his own name had perished, and his\nrelations lay under the interdiction of his hate, it is no wonder that\nthrough the familiarity and friendly intercourse subsisting between him\nand Mr. Gamaliel, he contracted a liking for the boy, who by this time\nentered the third year of his age, and was indeed a very handsome,\nhealthy, and promising child; and what seemed to ingratiate him still\nmore with his uncle, was a certain oddity of disposition, for which he\nhad been remarkable even from his cradle. It is reported of him, that\nbefore the first year of his infancy was elapsed, he used very often,\nimmediately after being dressed, in the midst of the caresses which\nwere bestowed upon him by his mother, while she indulged herself in the\ncontemplation of her own happiness, all of a sudden to alarm her with\na fit of shrieks and cries, which continued with great violence till\nhe was stripped to the skin with the utmost expedition by order of\nhis affrighted parent, who thought his tender body was tortured by the\nmisapplication of some unlucky pill; and when he had given them all this\ndisturbance and unnecessary trouble, he would lie sprawling and laughing\nin their faces, as if he ridiculed the impertinence of their concern.\nNay, it is affirmed, that one day, when an old woman who attended in the\nnursery had by stealth conveyed a bottle of cordial waters to her mouth,\nhe pulled his nurse by the sleeve, by a slight glance detected the\ntheft, and tipped her the wink with a particular slyness of countenance,\nas if he had said, with a sneer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay, that is what you must all come\nto.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But these instances of reflection in a babe nine months old are\nso incredible, that I look upon them as observations, founded upon\nimaginary recollection, when he was in a more advanced age, and his\npeculiarities of temper became much more remarkable; of a piece with\nthe ingenious discoveries of those sagacious observers, who can\ndiscern something evidently characteristic in the features of any noted\npersonage whose character they have previously heard explained. Yet\nwithout pretending to specify at what period of his childhood this\nsingularity first appeared, I can with great truth declare, that when\nhe first attracted the notice and affection of his uncle, it was plainly\nperceivable.\n\nOne would imagine he had marked out the commodore as a proper object of\nridicule, for almost all his little childish satire was leveled\nagainst him. I will not deny that he might have been influenced in this\nparticular by the example and instruction of Mr. Hatchway, who delighted\nin superintending the first essays of his genius. As the gout had taken\nup its residence in Mr. Trunnion's great toe, from whence it never\nremoved, no not for a day, little Perry took great pleasure in treading\nby accident on this infirm member; and when his uncle, incensed by the\npain, used to damn him for a hell-begotten brat, he would appease him in\na twinkling, by returning the curse with equal emphasis, and asking\nwhat was the matter with old Hannibal Tough? an appellation by which the\nlieutenant had taught him to distinguish this grim commander.\n\nNeither was this the only experiment he tried upon the patience of the\ncommodore, with whose nose he used to take indecent freedoms, even.\nwhile he was fondled on his knee. In one month he put him to the\nexpense of two guineas in seal-skin; by picking his pocket of divers\ntobacco-pouches, all of which he in secret committed to the flames. Nor\ndid the caprice of his disposition abstain from the favourite beverage\nof Trunnion, who more than once swallowed a whole draught in which\nhis brother's snuff-box had been emptied, before he perceived the\ndisagreeable infusion; and one day, when the commodore had chastised him\nby a gentle tap with his cane, he fell flat on the floor as if he had\nbeen deprived of all sense and motion, to the terror and amazement of\nthe striker; and after having filled the whole house with confusion and\ndismay, opened his eyes, and laughed heartily at the success of his own\nimposition.\n\nIt would be an endless and perhaps no very agreeable task, to enumerate\nall the unlucky pranks he played upon his uncle and others, before he\nattained the fourth year of his age; about which time he was sent, with\nan attendant, to a day-school in the neighbourhood, that (to use his\ngood mother's own expression) he might be out of harm's way. Here,\nhowever, he made little progress, except in mischief, which he practised\nwith impunity, because the school-mistress would run no risk of\ndisobliging a lady of fortune, by exercising unnecessary severities upon\nher only child. Nevertheless, Mrs. Pickle was not so blindly partial as\nto be pleased with such unseasonable indulgence. Perry was taken out of\nthe hands of this courteous teacher, and committed to the instruction\nof a pedagogue, who was ordered to administer such correction as the boy\nshould in his opinion deserve. This authority he did not neglect to\nuse, his pupil was regularly flogged twice a day; and after having been\nsubjected to this course of discipline for the space of eighteen months,\ndeclared the most obstinate, dull, and untoward genius that ever had\nfallen under his cultivation; instead of being reformed, he seemed\nrather hardened and confirmed in his vicious inclinations, and was dead\nto all sense of fear as well as shame.\n\nHis mother was extremely mortified at these symptoms of stupidity, which\nshe considered as an inheritance derived from the spirit of his father,\nand consequently insurmountable by all the efforts of human care.\nBut the commodore rejoiced over the ruggedness of his nature, and was\nparticularly pleased when, upon inquiry, he found that Perry had beaten\nall the boys in the school; a circumstance from which he prognosticated\neverything that was fair and fortunate in his future fate: observing,\nthat at his age he himself was just such another. The boy, who was\nnow turned of six, having profited so little under the birch of\nhis unsparing governor, Mrs. Pickle was counselled to send him to a\nboarding-school not far from London, which was kept by a certain person\nvery eminent for his successful method of education. This advice she the\nmore readily embraced, because at that time she found herself pretty\nfar gone with another child that she hoped would console her for the\ndisappointment she had met with in the unpromising talents of Perry,\nor at any rate divide her concern, so as to enable her to endure the\nabsence of either.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\n\nPeregrine is sent to a boarding-school--Becomes remarkable for his\nGenius and Ambition.\n\n\nThe commodore, understanding her determination, to which her husband did\nnot venture to make the least objection, interested himself so much\nin behalf of his favourite, as to fit him out at his own charge, and\naccompany him in person to the place of his destination; where he\ndefrayed the expense of his entrance, and left him to the particular\ncare and inspection of the usher, who having been recommended to him\nas a person of parts and integrity, received per advance a handsome\nconsideration for the task he undertook.\n\nNothing could be better judged than this piece of liberality; the\nassistant was actually a man of learning, probity, and good sense; and\nthough obliged by the scandalous administration of fortune to act in\nthe character of an inferior teacher, had, by his sole capacity and\napplication, brought the school to that degree of reputation, which\nit never could have obtained from the talents of its superior. He had\nestablished an economy, which, though regular, was not at all severe,\nby enacting a body of laws suited to the age and comprehension of every\nindividual; and each transgressor was fairly tried by his peers, and\npunished according to the verdict of the jury. No boy was scourged for\nwant of apprehension, but a spirit of emulation was raised by well-timed\npraise and artful comparison, and maintained by a distribution of small\nprizes, which were adjudged to those who signalized themselves either by\ntheir industry, sobriety, or genius.\n\nThis tutor, whose name was Jennings, began with Perry, according to his\nconstant maxim, by examining the soil; that is, studying his temper,\nin order to consult the bias of his disposition, which was strangely\nperverted by the absurd discipline he had undergone. He found him in a\nstate of sullen insensibility, which the child had gradually contracted\nin a long course of stupefying correction; and at first he was not in\nthe least actuated by that commendation which animated the rest of\nhis school-fellows; nor was it in the power of reproach to excite his\nambition, which had been buried, as it were, in the grave of disgrace;\nthe usher, therefore, had recourse to contemptuous neglect, with\nwhich he affected to treat this stubborn spirit; foreseeing that if he\nretained any seeds of sentiment, this weather would infallibly raise\nthem into vegetation; his judgment was justified by the event; the boy\nin a little time began to make observations; he perceived the marks\nof distinction with which virtue was rewarded, grew ashamed of the\ndespicable figure he himself made among his companions, who, far from\ncourting, rather shunned his conversation, and actually pined at his own\nwant of importance.\n\nMr. Jennings saw and rejoiced at his mortification, which he suffered\nto proceed as far as possible, without endangering his health. The child\nlost all relish for diversion, loathed his food, grew pensive, solitary,\nand was frequently found weeping by himself. These symptoms plainly\nevinced the recovery of his feelings, to which his governor thought it\nnow high time to make application; and therefore by little and little\naltered his behaviour from the indifference he had put on, to the\nappearance of more regard and attention. This produced a favourable\nchange in the boy, whose eyes sparkled with satisfaction one day, when\nhis master expressed himself, with a show of surprise, in these words:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, Perry! I find you don't want genius, when you think proper to\nuse it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Such encomiums kindled the spirit of emulation in his little\nbreast; he exerted himself with surprising alacrity, by which he soon\nacquitted himself of the imputation of dullness, and obtained sundry\nhonorary silver pennies, as acknowledgments of his application; his\nschool-fellows now solicited his friendship as eagerly as they had\navoided it before; and in less than a twelvemonth after his arrival,\nthis supposed dunce was remarkable for the brightness of his parts;\nhaving in that short period learnt to read English perfectly well, made\ngreat progress in writing, enabled himself to speak the French language\nwithout hesitation, and acquired some knowledge in the rudiments of\nthe Latin tongue. The usher did not fail to transmit an account of\nhis proficiency to the commodore, who received it with transport, and\nforthwith communicated the happy tidings to the parents.\n\nMr. Gamaliel Pickle, who was never subject to violent emotions, heard\nthem with a sort of phlegmatic satisfaction, that scarce manifested\nitself either in his countenance or expressions; nor did the child's\nmother break forth into that rapture and admiration which might\nhave been expected, when she understood how much the talents of her\nfirst-born had exceeded the hope of her warmest imagination. Not but\nthat she professed herself well pleased with Perry's reputation;\nthough she observed that in these commendations the truth was always\nexaggerated by schoolmasters, for their own interest; and pretended to\nwonder that the usher had not mingled more probability with his\npraise. Trunnion was offended at her indifference and want of faith\nand believing that she refined too much in her discernment, swore that\nJennings had declared the truth, and nothing but the truth; for he\nhimself had prophesied, from the beginning, that the boy would turn out\na credit to his family. But by this time Mrs. Pickle was blessed with\na daughter, whom she had brought into the world about six months before\nthe intelligence arrived; so that her care and affection being otherwise\nengrossed, the praise of Perry was the less greedily devoured. The\nabatement of her fondness was an advantage to his education, which would\nhave been retarded, and perhaps ruined, by pernicious indulgence, and\npreposterous interposition, had her love considered him as an only\nchild; whereas her concern being now diverted to another object,\nthat shared, at least, one-half of her affection, he was left to the\nmanagement of his preceptor, who tutored him according to his own\nplan, without any let or interruption. Indeed all his sagacity and\ncircumspection were but barely sufficient to keep the young gentleman\nin order; for now that he had won the palm of victory from his rivals in\npoint of scholarship, his ambition dilated, and he was seized with the\ndesire of subjecting the whole school by the valour of his arm. Before\nhe could bring his project to bear, innumerable battles were fought with\nvarious success; every day a bloody nose and complaint were presented\nagainst him, and his own visage commonly bore some livid marks of\nobstinate contention. At length, however, he accomplished his aim; his\nadversaries were subdued, his prowess acknowledged, and he obtained the\nlaurel in war as well as in wit. Thus triumphant, he was intoxicated\nwith success: his pride rose in proportion to his power and, in spite\nof all the endeavours of Jennings, who practised every method he could\ninvent for curbing his licentious conduct, without depressing his\nspirit, he contracted a large proportion of insolence, which series of\nmisfortunes that happened to him in the sequel could scarce effectually\ntame. Nevertheless there was a fund of good nature and generosity in his\ncomposition; and though he established a tyranny among his comrades, the\ntranquility of his reign was maintained by the love rather than by the\nfear of his subjects.\n\nIn the midst of all this enjoyment of empire he never once violated that\nrespectful awe with which the usher had found means to inspire him; but\nhe by no means preserved the same regard for the principal master, an\nold illiterate German quack, who had formerly practised corn-cutting\namong the quality, and sold cosmetic washes to the ladies, together with\nteeth-powders, hair-dyeing liquors, prolific elixirs, and tinctures to\nsweeten the breath. These nostrums, recommended by the art of cringing,\nin which he was consummate, ingratiated him so much with people of\nfashion, that he was enabled to set up school with five-and-twenty boys\nof the best families, whom he boarded on his own terms and undertook to\ninstruct in the French and Latin languages, so as to qualify them\nfor the colleges of Westminster and Eton. While this plan was in its\ninfancy, he was so fortunate as to meet with Jennings, who, for the\npaltry consideration of thirty pounds a year, which his necessities\ncompelled him to accept, took the whole trouble of educating the\nchildren upon himself, contrived an excellent system for that purpose,\nand, by his assiduity and knowledge, executed all the particulars to the\nentire satisfaction of those concerned, who, by the bye, never inquired\ninto his qualifications, but suffered the other to enjoy the fruits of\nhis labour and ingenuity.\n\nOver and above a large stock of avarice, ignorance, and vanity, this\nsuperior had certain ridiculous peculiarities in his person, such as\na hunch upon his back, and distorted limbs, that seemed to attract the\nsatirical notice of Peregrine, who, young as he was, took offence at\nhis want of reverence for his usher, over whom he sometimes chose\nopportunities of displaying his authority, that the boys might not\nmisplace their veneration. Mr. Keypstick, therefore, such as I\nhave described him, incurred the contempt and displeasure of this\nenterprising pupil, who now being in the tenth year of his age, had\ncapacity enough to give him abundance of vexation. He underwent many\nmortifying jokes front the invention of Pickle and his confederates; so\nthat he began to entertain suspicion of Mr. Jennings, who he could\nnot help thinking had been at the bottom of them all, and spirited up\nprinciples of rebellion in the school, with a view of making himself\nindependent. Possessed with this chimera, which was void of all\nfoundation, the German descended so low as to tamper in private with the\nboys, from whom he hoped to draw some very important discovery; but he\nwas disappointed in his expectations; and this mean practice reaching\nthe ears of his usher, he voluntarily resigned his employment. Finding\ninterest to obtain holy orders in a little time after, he left\nthe kingdom, hoping to find a settlement in some of our American\nplantations.\n\nThe departure of Mr. Jennings produced a great revolution in the affairs\nof Keypstick, which declined from that moment, because he had neither\nauthority to enforce obedience, nor prudence to maintain order among his\nscholars: so that the school degenerated into anarchy and confusion, and\nhe himself dwindled in the opinion of his employers, who looked upon him\nas superannuated, and withdrew their children front his tuition.\n\nPeregrine seeing this dissolution of their society, and finding himself\nevery day deprived of some companion, began to repine at his situation,\nand resolved, if possible, to procure his release from the jurisdiction\nof the person whom he both detested and despised. With this view he went\nto work, and composed the following billet, addressed to the commodore,\nwhich was the first specimen of his composition in the epistolary way:--\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cHonoured and Loving Uncle,--Hoping you are in good health,\n    this serves to inform you, that Mr. Jennings is gone, and\n    Mr. Keypstick will never meet with his fellow. The school\n    is already almost broke up, and the rest daily going away;\n    and I beg of you of all love to have me fetched away also,\n    for I cannot bear to be any longer under one who is a perfect\n    ignoramus, who scarce knows the declination of musa, and is\n    more fit to be a scarecrow than a schoolmaster; hoping you\n    will send for me soon, with my love to my aunt, and my duty\n    to my honoured parents, craving their blessing and yours. And\n    this is all at present from, honoured uncle, your well-beloved\n    and dutiful nephew and godson, and humble servant to command\n    till death,\n                             \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeregrine Pickle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nTrunnion was overjoyed at the receipt of this letter, which he looked\nupon as one of the greatest efforts of human genius, and as such\ncommunicated the contents to his lady, whom he had disturbed for the\npurpose in the middle of her devotion, by sending a message to her\ncloset, whither it was her custom very frequently to retire. She was\nout of humour at being interrupted, and therefore did not peruse this\nspecimen of her nephew's understanding with all the relish that the\ncommodore himself had enjoyed; on the contrary, after sundry paralytical\nendeavours to speak (for her tongue sometimes refused its office), she\nobserved that the boy was a pert jackanapes, and deserved to be severely\nchastised for treating his betters with such disrespect. Her husband\nundertook his godson's defence, representing with great warmth that he\nknew Keypstick to be a good-for-nothing pimping old rascal, and that\nPerry showed a great deal of spirit and good sense in desiring to be\ntaken from under his command; he therefore declared that the boy\nshould not live a week longer with such a shambling son of a b--, and\nsanctioned this declaration with abundance of oaths.\n\nMrs. Trunnion, composing her countenance into a look of religious\ndemureness, rebuked him for his profane way of talking; and asked, in\na magisterial tone, if he intended never to lay aside that brutal\nbehaviour. Irritated at this reproach, he answered, in terms of\nindignation, that he knew how to behave himself as well as e'er a woman\nthat wore a head, bade her mind her affairs, and with another repetition\nof oaths gave her to understand that he would be master in his own\nhouse.\n\nThe insinuation operated upon her spirits like friction upon a glass\nglobe: her face gleamed with resentment, and every pore seemed to emit\nparticles of flame. She replied with incredible fluency of the bitterest\nexpressions: he retorted equal rage in broken hints and incoherent\nimprecations: she rejoined with redoubled fury; and in conclusion he was\nfain to betake himself to flight, ejaculating curses against her; and\nmuttering something concerning the brandy-bottle, which, however, he\ntook care should never reach her ears.\n\nFrom his own house he went directly to visit Mrs. Pickle, to whom\nhe imparted Peregrine's epistle, with many encomiums upon the boy's\npromising parts: and, finding his commendations but coolly received,\ndesired she would permit him to take his godson under his own care.\n\nThis lady, whose family was now increased by another son, who seemed to\nengross her care for the present, had not seen Perry during a course\nof four years, and, with regard to him, was perfectly weaned of\nthat infirmity known by the name of maternal fondness: she therefore\nconsented to the commodore's request with great condescension, and a\npolite compliment to him on the concern he had all along manifested for\nthe welfare of the child.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\n\nThe Commodore takes Peregrine under his own care--The Boy arrives at\nthe Garrison--Is strangely received by his own Mother--Enters into a\nConfederacy with Hatchway and Pipes, and executes a couple of waggish\nEnterprises upon his Aunt.\n\n\nTrunnion having obtained this permission, that very afternoon despatched\nthe lieutenant in a post-chaise to Keypstick's house, from whence in two\ndays he returned with our young hero, who being now in the eleventh\nyear of his age, had outgrown the expectation of all his family, and was\nremarkable for the beauty and elegance of his person. His godfather was\ntransported at his arrival, as if he had been actually the issue of\nhis own loins: he shook him heartily by the hand, turned him round and\nround, surveyed him from top to bottom, bade Hatchway take notice how\nhandsomely he was built; and squeezed his hand again, saying,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cD-- ye,\nyou dog, I suppose you don't value such an old crazy son of a b-- as me\na rope's end. You have forgot how I was wont to dandle you on my knee,\nwhen you was a little urchin no bigger than a davit, and played a\nthousand tricks upon me, burning my 'bacco-pouches and poisoning my\nrumbo. O! d-- ye, you can grin fast enough I see; I warrant you have\nlearnt more things than writing and the Latin lingo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEven Tom Pipes expressed uncommon satisfaction on this joyful occasion;\nand, coming up to Perry, thrust forth his fore paw, and accosted him\nwith the salutation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat cheer, my young master? I am glad to see\nthee with all my heart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These compliments being passed, his uncle\nhalted to the door of his wife's chamber, at which he stood hallooing,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere's your kinsman, Perry: belike you won't come and bid him\nwelcome.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord, Mr. Trunnion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy will you continually\nharass me in this manner with your impertinent intrusion?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI harrow\nyou!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the commodore: \u00e2\u0080\u009c'sblood! I believe your upper works are\ndamaged: I only came to inform you that here was your cousin, whom you\nhave not seen these four long years; and I'll be d--d if there is such\nanother of his age within the king's dominions, d'ye see, either for\nmake or mettle: he's a credit to the name, d'ye see: but, d-- my eyes,\nI'll say no more of the matter: if you come, you may; if you won't,\nyou may let it alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I won't come, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered his\nyoke-fellow, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I am at present more agreeably employed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cOho!\nyou are. I believe so too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the commodore, making wry faces and\nmimicking the action of dram-drinking. Then, addressing himself to\nHatchway, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPrithee, Jack,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgo and try thy skill on that\nstubborn hulk: if anybody can bring her about, I know you wool.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe lieutenant accordingly, taking his station at the door, conveyed\nhis persuasion in these words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat, won't you turn out and hail little\nPerry? It will do your heart good to see such a handsome young dog; I'm\nsure he is the very moral of you, and as like as if he had been spit out\nof your own mouth, as the saying is: do show a little respect for your\nkinsman, can't you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d To this remonstrance she replied, in a mild tone of\nvoice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDear Mr. Hatchway, you are always teasing one in such a manner:\nsure I am, nobody can tax me with unkindness, or want of natural\naffection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, she opened the door, and, advancing to the hall\nwhere her nephew stood, received him very graciously and observed that\nhe was the very image of her papa.\n\nIn the afternoon he was conducted by the commodore to the house of his\nparents; and, strange to tell, no sooner was he presented to his mother,\nthan her countenance changed, she eyed him with tokens of affliction and\nsurprise, and, bursting into tears, exclaimed her child was dead, and\nthis was no other than an impostor whom they had brought to defraud her\nsorrow. Trunnion was confounded at this unaccountable passion, which had\nno other foundation than caprice and whim; and Gamaliel himself was so\ndisconcerted and unsettled in his own belief, which began to waver,\nthat he knew not how to behave towards the boy, whom his godfather\nimmediately carried back to the garrison, swearing all the way that\nPerry should never cross their threshold again with his good-will. Nay,\nso much was he incensed at this unnatural and absurd renunciation, that\nhe refused to carry on any further correspondence with Pickle, until he\nwas appeased by his solicitations and submission, and Peregrine owned as\nhis son and heir. But this acknowledgment was made without the privity\nof his wife, whose vicious aversion he was obliged, in appearance, to\nadopt. Thus exiled from his father's house, the young gentleman was left\nentirely to the disposal of the commodore, whose affection for him daily\nincreased, insomuch that he could scarcely prevail upon himself to\npart with him, when his education absolutely required that he should be\notherwise disposed of.\n\nIn all probability, this extraordinary attachment was, if not produced,\nat least riveted by that peculiar turn in Peregrine's imagination, which\nwe have already observed; and which, during his residence in the castle,\nappeared in sundry stratagems he practised upon his uncle and aunt,\nunder the auspices of Mr. Hatchway who assisted him in the contrivance\nand execution of all his schemes. Nor was Pipes exempted from a share in\ntheir undertakings; for, being a trusty fellow, not without dexterity\nin some cases, and altogether resigned to their will, they found him a\nserviceable instrument for their purpose, and used him accordingly.\n\nThe first sample of their art was exhibited upon Mrs. Trunnion. They\nterrified that good lady with strange noises when she retired to her\ndevotion. Pipes was a natural genius in the composition of discords: he\ncould imitate the sound produced by the winding of a jack, the filing\nof a saw, and the swinging of a malefactor hanging in chains; he could\ncounterfeit the braying of an ass, the screeching of a night-owl, the\ncaterwauling of cats, the howling of a dog, the squeaking of a pig,\nthe crowing of a cock; and he had learned the war-whoop uttered by the\nIndians in North America. These talents were exerted successively,\nat different times and places, to the terror of Mrs. Trunnion, the\ndiscomposure of the commodore himself, and the consternation of all\nthe servants in the castle. Peregrine, with a sheet over his clothes,\nsometimes tumbled before his aunt in the twilight, when her organs of\nvision were a little impaired by the cordial she had swallowed; and the\nboatswain's mate taught him to shoe cats with walnut-shells, so that\nthey made a most dreadful clattering in their nocturnal excursions.\n\nThe mind of Mrs. Trunnion was not a little disturbed by these alarms,\nwhich, in her opinion, portended the death of some principal person in\nthe family; she redoubled her religious exercises, and fortified her\nspirits with fresh potations; nay, she began to take notice that Mr.\nTrunnion's constitution was very much broken, and seemed dissatisfied\nwhen people observed that they never saw him look better. Her frequent\nvisits to the closet, where all her consolation was deposited, inspired\nthe confederates with a device which had like to have been attended with\ntragical consequences. They found an opportunity to infuse jalap in one\nof her case-bottles; and she took so largely of this medicine, that her\nconstitution had well nigh sunk under the violence of its effect. She\nsuffered a succession of fainting fits that reduced her to the brink\nof the grave, in spite of all the remedies that were administered by a\nphysician, who was called in the beginning of her disorder.\n\nAfter having examined the symptoms, he declared that the patient had\nbeen poisoned with arsenic, and prescribed only draughts and lubricating\ninjections, to defend the coats of the stomach and intestines from\nthe vellicating particles of that pernicious mineral; at the same time\nhinting, with a look of infinite sagacity, that it was not difficult to\ndivine the whole mystery. He affected to deplore the poor lady, as if\nshe was exposed to more attempts of the same nature; thereby glancing\nobliquely at the innocent commodore, whom the officious son of\nAesculapius suspected as the author of this expedient, to rid his hands\nof a yoke-fellow for whom he was well known to have no great devotion.\nThis impertinent and malicious insinuation made some impression upon the\nbystanders, and furnished ample field for slander to asperse the morals\nof Trunnion, who was represented through the whole district as a monster\nof barbarity. Nay, the sufferer herself, though she behaved with great\ndecency and prudence, could not help entertaining some small diffidence\nof her husband; not that she imagined he had any design upon her life,\nbut that he had been at pains to adulterate the brandy with a view of\ndetaching her from that favourite liquor.\n\nOn this supposition, she resolved to act with more caution for the\nfuture, without setting on foot any inquiry about the affair; while the\ncommodore, imputing her indisposition to some natural cause, after the\ndanger was past, never bestowed a thought upon the subject; so that the\nperpetrators were quit of their fear, which, however, had punished them\nso effectually, that they never would hazard any more jokes of the same\nnature.\n\nThe shafts of their wit were now directed against the commander himself,\nwhom they teased and terrified almost out of his senses. One day, while\nhe was at dinner, Pipes came and told him that there was a person\nbelow that wanted to speak with him immediately, about an affair of the\ngreatest importance, that would admit of no delay; upon which he ordered\nthe stranger to be told that he was engaged, and that he must send up\nhis name and business. To this demand he received for answer a message\nimporting that the person's name was unknown to him, and his business\nof such a nature, that it could not be disclosed to any one but the\ncommodore himself, whom he earnestly desired to see without loss of\ntime.\n\nTrunnion, surprised at this importunity, got up with great reluctance,\nin the middle of his meal, and descending to a parlour where the\nstranger was, asked him, in a surly tone, what he wanted with him in\nsuch a d--d hurry, that he could not wait till he had made an end of his\nmess? The other, not at all disconcerted at this rough address, advanced\nclose up to him on his tiptoes, and, with a look of confidence and\nconceit, laying his mouth to one side of the commodore's head, whispered\nsoftly in his car, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir, I am the attorney whom you wanted to converse\nwith in private.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe attorney?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Trunnion, staring, and\nhalf-choked with choler. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir, at your service,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied this\nretainer of the law; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, if you please, the sooner we despatch the\naffair the better; for 'tis an old observation, that delay breeds\ndanger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cTruly, brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the commodore, who could no longer\ncontain himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do confess that I am very much of your way of\nthinking, d'ye see, and therefore you shall be despatched in a trice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n So saying, he lifted up his walking-staff, which was something between\na crutch and a cudgel, and discharged it with such energy on the seat of\nthe attorney's understanding, that if there had been anything but solid\nbone, the contents of his skull must have been evacuated.\n\nFortified as he was by nature against all such assaults, he could not\nwithstand the momentum of the blow, which in an instant laid him flat\non the floor, deprived of all sense and motion; and Trunnion hopped\nupstairs to dinner, applauding himself in ejaculations all the way for\nthe vengeance he had taken on such an impudent pettifogging miscreant.\n\nThe attorney no sooner awaked from his trance, into which he had been so\nunexpectedly killed, than he cast his eyes around in quest of evidence,\nby which he might be enabled the more easily to prove the injury he had\nsustained, but not a soul appearing, he made shift to get upon his legs\nagain, and, with the blood trickling over his nose, followed one of the\nservants into the dining-room, resolved to come to an explanation with\nthe assailant, and either extort money from him by way of satisfaction,\nor provoke him to a second application before witnesses. With this\nview, he entered the room in a peal of clamour, to the amazement of all\npresent, and the terror of Mrs. Trunnion, who shrieked at the appearance\nof such a spectacle; and addressing himself to the commodore, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll\ntell you what, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif there be law in England, I'll make you\nsmart for this here assault.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You think you have screened yourself from\na prosecution by sending all your servants out of the way; but that\ncircumstance will appear upon trial to be a plain proof of the malice\nprepense with which the fact was committed; especially when corroborated\nby the evidence of this here letter, under your own hand, whereby I am\ndesired to come to your own house to transact an affair of consequence.\nSo he produced the writing, and read the contents in these words:--\n\n                 \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Roger Ravine.\n    Sir,--Being in a manner prisoner in my own house, I desire\n    you will give me a call precisely at three o'clock in the\n    afternoon, and insist upon seeing myself, as I have an affair\n    of great consequence, in which your particular advice is\n    wanted by your humble servant,\n                                   \u00e2\u0080\u009cHawser Trunnion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe one-eyed commander, who had been satisfied with the chastisement he\nhad already bestowed upon the plaintiff, hearing him read this audacious\npiece of forgery, which he considered as the effect of his own villainy,\nstarted up from table, and seizing a huge turkey that lay in a dish\nbefore him, would have applied it, sauce and all, by way of poultice, to\nhis wound, had he not been restrained by Hatchway, who laid fast hold on\nboth his arms, and fixed him to his chair again, advising the attorney\nto sheer off with what he had got. Far from following this salutary\ncounsel, he redoubled his threats: set Trunnion at defiance, telling him\nhe not a man of true courage, although he had commanded a ship of war,\nor else he would not have attacked any person in such a cowardly and\nclandestine manner. This provocation would have answered his purpose\neffectually, had not his adversary's indignation been repressed by the\nsuggestions of the lieutenant, who desired his friend, in a whisper, to\nbe easy, for he would take care to have the attorney tossed in a\nblanket for his presumption. This proposal, which he received with\ngreat approbation, pacified him in a moment: he wiped the sweat from his\nforehead, and his features relaxed into a grim smile.\n\nHatchway disappeared; and Ravine proceeded with great fluency of abuse,\nuntil he was interrupted by the arrival of Pipes, who, without any\nexpostulation, led him out by the hand, and conducted him to the yard,\nwhere he was put into a carpet, and in a twinkling sent into the air by\nthe strength and dexterity of five stout operators, whom the lieutenant\nhad selected from the number of domestics for that singular spell of\nduty.\n\nIn vain did the astonished vaulter beg, for the love of God, that they\nwould take pity upon him, and put an end to his involuntary gambols:\nthey were deaf to his prayers and protestations, even when he swore,\nin the most solemn manner, that if they would cease tormenting him, he\nwould forget and forgive what was past, and depart in peace to his own\nhabitation; and continued the game till they were fatigued with the\nexercise.\n\nRavine being dismissed in a most melancholy plight, brought an action\nof assault and battery against the commodore, and subpoenaed all the\nservants as evidences in the cause; but as none of them had seen what\nhappened, he did not find his account in the prosecution, though he\nhimself examined all the witnesses, and, among their questions, asked,\nwhether they had not seen him come in like another man? and whether they\nhad ever seen any other man in such condition as that in which he\nhad crawled off. But this last interrogation they were not obliged\nto answer, because it had reference to the second discipline he had\nundergone, in which they, and they only, were concerned; and no person\nis bound to give testimony against himself.\n\nIn short, the attorney was nonsuited, to the satisfaction of all who\nknew him, and found himself under the necessity of proving that he had\nreceived, in course of post, the letter which was declared in court a\nscandalous forgery, in order to prevent an indictment with which he was\nthreatened by the commodore, who little dreamt that the whole affair had\nbeen planned and executed by Peregrine and his associates.\n\nThe next enterprise in which this triumvirate engaged, was a scheme to\nfrighten Trunnion with an apparition, which they prepared and exhibited\nin this manner: to the hide of a large ox, Pipes fitted a leathern vizor\nof a most terrible appearance, stretched on the jaws of a shark, which\nhe had brought from sea, and accommodated with a couple of broad glasses\ninstead of eyes. On the inside of these he placed two rushlights, and,\nwith a composition of sulphur and saltpetre, made a pretty large fusee,\nwhich he fixed between two rows of the teeth. This equipage being\nfinished, he, one dark night chosen for the purpose, put it on, and,\nfollowing the commodore into a long passage, in which he was preceded by\nPerry with a light in his hand, kindled his firework with a match, and\nbegan to bellow like a bull. The boy, as it was concerted, looked behind\nhim, screamed aloud, and dropped the light, which was extinguished\nin the fall; when Trunnion, alarmed at his nephew's consternation,\nexclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cZounds! what's the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and turning about to see the\ncause of his dismay, beheld a hideous phantom vomiting blue flame, which\naggravated the horrors of its aspect. He was instantly seized with an\nagony of fear, which divested him of his reason: nevertheless, he, as it\nwere mechanically, raised his trusty supporter in his own defence,\nand, the apparition advancing towards him, aimed it at this dreadful\nannoyance with such a convulsive exertion of strength, that had not the\nblow chanced to light upon one of the horns Mr. Pipes would have had no\ncause to value himself upon his invention. Misapplied as it was, he did\nnot fail to stagger at the shock; and, dreading another such salutation,\nclosed with the commodore, and having tripped up his heels, retreated\nwith great expedition.\n\nIt was then that Peregrine, pretending to recollect himself a little,\nran, with all the marks of disturbance and affright, and called up the\nservants to the assistance of their master, whom they found in a cold\nsweat upon the floor, his features betokening horror and confusion.\nHatchway raised him up, and having comforted him with a cup of Nantz,\nbegan to inquire into the cause of his disorder: but he could not\nextract one word of answer from his friend, who, after a considerable\npause, during which he seemed to be wrapt in profound contemplation,\npronounced aloud, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the Lord! Jack, you may say what you wool; but\nI'll be d-- if it was not Davy Jones himself. I know him by his saucer\neyes, his three rows of teeth, his horns and tail, and the blue smoke\nthat came out of his nostrils. What does the blackguard hell's baby\nwant with me? I'm sure I never committed murder, except in the way of my\nprofession, nor wronged any man whatsomever since I first went to sea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n This same Davy Jones, according to the mythology of sailors, is the\nfiend that presides over all the evil spirits of the deep, and is\noften seen in various shapes, perching among the rigging on the eve of\nhurricanes, shipwrecks, and other disasters, to which a seafaring life\nis exposed; warning the devoted wretch of death and woe. No wonder then\nthat Trunnion was disturbed by a supposed visit of this demon, which, in\nhis opinion, foreboded some dreadful calamity.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n\n\nHe is also, by their device, engaged in an Adventure with the Exciseman,\nwho does not find his Account in his own Drollery.\n\n\nHowsomever preposterous and unaccountable that passion may be which\nprompts persons, otherwise generous and sympathizing, to afflict\nand perplex their fellow-creatures, certain it is, our confederates\nentertained such a large proportion of it, that not satisfied with the\npranks they had already played, they still persecuted the commodore\nwithout ceasing. In the course of his own history, the particulars of\nwhich he delighted to recount, he had often rehearsed an adventure of\ndeer-stealing, in which, during the unthinking impetuosity of his\nyouth, he had been unfortunately concerned. Far from succeeding in that\nachievement, he and his associates had, it seems, been made prisoners,\nafter an obstinate engagement with the keepers, and carried before\na neighbouring justice of the peace, who used Trunnion with great\nindignity, and with his companions committed him to jail.\n\nHis own relations, and in particular an uncle on whom he chiefly\ndepended, treated him during his confinement with great rigour and\ninhumanity and absolutely refused to interpose his influence in his\nbehalf, unless he would sign a writing, obliging himself to go to\nsea within thirty days after his release, under the penalty of being\nproceeded against as a felon. The alternative was, either to undergo\nthis voluntary exile, or remain in prison disowned and deserted by\neverybody, and, after all, suffer an ignominious trial, that might end\nin a sentence of transportation for life. He therefore, without much\nhesitation, embraced the proposal of his kinsman, and, as he observed,\nwas, in less than a month after his discharge, turned adrift to the\nmercy of the wind and waves.\n\nSince that period he had never maintained any correspondence with his\nrelations, all of whom had concurred in sending him off; nor would he\never pay the least regard to the humiliations and supplications of some\namong them, who had prostrated themselves before him, on the advancement\nof his fortune: but he retained a most inveterate resentment against\nhis uncle, who was still in being, though extremely old and infirm, and\nfrequently mentioned his name with all the bitterness of revenge.\n\nPerry being perfectly well acquainted with the particulars of this\nstory, which he had heard so often repeated, proposed to Hatchway that\na person should be hired to introduce himself to the commodore, with a\nsupposititious letter of recommendation from this detested kinsman; an\nimposition that, in all likelihood, would afford abundance of diversion.\n\nThe lieutenant relished the scheme and young Pickle having composed an\nepistle for the occasion, the exciseman of the parish, a fellow of great\nimpudence and some humour, in whom Hatchway could confide, undertook to\ntranscribe and deliver it with his own hand, and also personate the\nman in whose favour it was feigned to be written. He, accordingly, one\nmorning arrived on horseback at the garrison, two hours at least\nbefore Trunnion used to get up, and gave Pipes, who admitted him, to\nunderstand, that he had a letter from his master, which he was ordered\nto deliver to none but the commodore himself. This message was no sooner\ncommunicated, than the indignant chief (who had been waked for the\npurpose) began to curse the messenger for breaking his rest, and swore\nhe would not budge till his usual time of turning out. This resolution\nbeing conveyed to the stranger, he desired the carrier to go back and\ntell him, he had such joyful tidings to impart, that he was sure the\ncommodore would think himself amply rewarded for his trouble, even if he\nhad been raised from the grave to receive them.\n\nThis assurance, flattering as it was, would not have been powerful\nenough to persuade him, had it not been assisted with the exhortations\nof his spouse, which never failed to influence his conduct. He therefore\ncrept out of bed, though not without great repugnance; and wrapping\nhimself in his morning gown, was supported down-stairs, rubbing his eye,\nyawning fearfully, and grumbling in the way. As soon as he popped his\nhead into the parlour, the supposed stranger made divers awkward bows,\nand with a grinning aspect accosted him in these words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour most\nhumble servant, most noble commodore! I hope you are in good health; you\nlook pure and hearty; and if it was not for that misfortune of your eye,\none would not desire to see a more pleasant countenance in a summer's\nday. Sure as I am a living soul, one would take you to be on this side\nof threescore. Lord help us, I should have known you to be a Trunnion,\nif I had met with one in the midst of Salisbury Plain, as the saying\nis.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe commodore, who was not at all in the humour of relishing such an\nimpertinent preamble, interrupted him in this place, saying, with a\npeevish accent, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPshaw! pshaw! brother, there's no occasion to bowse out\nso much unnecessary gun; if you can't bring your discourse to bear on\nthe right subject, you had much better clap a stopper on your tongue,\nand bring yourself up, d'ye see; I was told you had something to\ndeliver.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cDeliver!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the waggish impostor, \u00e2\u0080\u009codds heart! I have\ngot something for you that will make your very entrails rejoice within\nyour body. Here's a letter from a dear and worthy friend of yours. Take,\nread it, and be happy. Blessings on his old heart! one would think he\nhad renewed his age, like the eagle's.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trunnion's expectation being\nthus raised, he called for his spectacles, adjusted them to his eye,\ntook the letter, and being curious to know the subscription, no sooner\nperceived his uncle's name, then he started back, his lip quivered, and\nhe began to shake in every limb with resentment and surprise; eager\nto know the subject of an epistle from a person who had never before\ntroubled him with any sort of address, he endeavoured to recollect\nhimself, and perused the contents, which were these;--\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cLoving Nephew,--I doubt not but you will be rejoiced to\n    hear of my welfare; and well you may, considering what a\n    kind uncle I have been to you in the days of your youth, and\n    how little you deserved any such thing; for yet, was always\n    a graceless young man, given to wicked courses and bad company,\n    whereby you would have come to a shameful end, had it not been\n    for my care in sending you out of mischief's way. But this is\n    not the cause of my present writing. The bearer, Mr. Timothy\n    Trickle, is a distant relation of yours, being the son of the\n    cousin of your aunt Margery, and is not over and above well as\n    to worldly matters. He thinks of going to London, to see for\n    some post in the excise or customs if so be that you will\n    recommend him to some great man of your acquaintance, and give\n    him a small matter to keep him till he is provided. I doubt not,\n    nephew, but you will be glad to serve him, if it was no more\n    but for the respect you bear to me, who am,--Loving nephew,\n    your affectionate uncle, and servant to command,\n                                          \u00e2\u0080\u009cTobiah Trunnion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nIt would be a difficult task for the inimitable Hogarth himself to\nexhibit the ludicrous expression of the commodore's countenance while\nhe read this letter. It was not a stare of astonishment, a convulsion\nof rage, or a ghastly grin of revenge; but an association of all three,\nthat took possession of his features. At length, he hawked up, with\nincredible straining, the interjection, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d that seemed to have stuck\nsome time in his windpipe; and thus gave vent to his indignation: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave\nI come alongside of you at last, you old stinking curmudgeon? You lie,\nyou lousy hulk! ye lie! you did all in your power to founder me when I\nwas a stripling; and as for being graceless and wicked, and keeping\nbad company, you tell a d--d lie again, you thief! there was not a more\npeaceable lad in the county, and I kept no bad company but your own,\nd'ye see. Therefore, you Trickle, or what's your name, tell the old\nrascal that sent you hither, that I spit in his face, and call him\nhorse; that I tear his letter into rags, so; and that I trample upon\nit as I would upon his own villainous carcase, d'ye see.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he\ndanced in a sort of frenzy upon the fragments of the paper, which he\nhad scattered about the room, to the inexpressible satisfaction of the\ntriumvirate, who beheld the scene.\n\nThe exciseman having got between him and the door, which was left open\nfor his escape, in case of necessity, affected great confusion and\nsurprise at his behaviour, saying, with an air of mortification, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLord\nbe merciful unto me! is this the way you treat your own relations, and\nthe recommendation of your best friend? Surely all gratitude and virtue\nhas left this sinful world! What will cousin Tim, and Dick, and Tom,\nand good mother Pipkin; and her daughters cousin Sue, and Prue, and\nPeg, with all the rest of our kinsfolks, say, when they hear of this\nunconscionable reception that I have met with? Consider, sir, that\ningratitude is worse than the sin of witchcraft, as the Apostle wisely\nobserves; and do not send me away with such unchristian usage, which\nwill lay a heavy load of guilt upon your poor miserable soul.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat,\nyou are on a cruise for a post, brother Trickle, an't ye?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nTrunnion, interrupting him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe shall find a post for you in a trice,\nmy boy. Here, Pipes, take this saucy son of a b-- and help him to the\nwhipping-post in the yard. I'll teach you to rouse me in the morning\nwith such impertinent messages.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPipes, who wanted to carry the joke farther than the exciseman dreamt\nof, laid hold of him in a twinkling, and executed the orders of his\ncommander, notwithstanding all his nods, winking, and significant\ngestures, which the boatswain's mate would by no means understand; so\nthat he began to repent of the part he acted in this performance, which\nwas like to end so tragically; and stood fastened to the stake, in a\nvery disagreeable state of suspense; casting many a rueful look over his\nleft shoulder, while Pipes was absent in quest of a cat-o'-nine-tails,\nin expectation of being relieved by the interposition of the lieutenant,\nwho did not, however, appear. Tom, returning with the instrument of\ncorrection, undressed the delinquent in a trice, and whispering in his\near, that he was very sorry for being employed in such an office, but\ndurst not for his soul disobey the orders of his commander, flourished\nthe scourge about his head, and with admirable dexterity made such a\nsmarting application to the offender's back and shoulders, that the\ndistracted gauger performed sundry new cuts with his feet, and bellowed\nhideously with pain, to the infinite satisfaction of the spectators. At\nlength, when he was almost flayed from his rump to the nape of his neck,\nHatchway, who had purposely absented himself hitherto, appeared in the\nyard, and interposing in his behalf, prevailed upon Trunnion to call off\nthe executioner, and ordered the malefactor to be released.\n\nThe exciseman, mad with the catastrophe he had undergone, threatened\nto be revenged upon his employers, by making a candid confession of\nthe whole plot; but the lieutenant giving him to understand, that in so\ndoing, he would bring upon himself a prosecution for fraud, forgery, and\nimposture, he was fain to put up with his loss; and sneaked out of the\ngarrison, attended with a volley of curses discharged upon him by\nthe commodore, who was exceedingly irritated by the disturbance and\ndisappointment he had undergone.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\n\nThe Commodore detects the Machinations of the Conspirators, and hires a\ntutor for Peregrine, whom he settles in Winchester School.\n\n\nThis was not the least affliction he had suffered from the unwearied\nendeavours and unexhausted invention of his tormentors, who harassed him\nwith such a variety of mischievous pranks, that he began to think all\nthe devils in hell had conspired against his peace; and accordingly\nbecame very serious and contemplative on the subject.\n\nIn the course of his meditations, when he recollected and compared\nthe circumstances of every mortification to which he had been lately\nexposed, he could not help suspecting that some of them must have been\ncontrived to vex him; and, as he was not ignorant of his lieutenant's\ndisposition, nor unacquainted with the talents of Peregrine, he\nresolved to observe them both for the future with the utmost care and\ncircumspection. This resolution, aided by the incautious conduct of\nthe conspirators, whom, by this time, success had rendered heedless and\nindiscreet, was attended with the desired effect. He in a little time,\ndetected Perry in a new plot; and by dint of a little chastisement,\nand a great many threats, extorted from him a confession of all\nthe contrivances in which he had been concerned. The commodore was\nthunderstruck at the discovery, and so much incensed against Hatchway\nfor the part he had acted in the whole, that he deliberated with\nhimself, whether he should demand satisfaction with sword and pistol, or\ndismiss him from the garrison, and renounce all friendship with him\nat once. But he had been so long accustomed to Jack's company, that he\ncould not live without him; and upon more cool reflection, perceiving\nthat what he had done was rather the effect of wantonness than malice,\nwhich he himself would have laughed to see take place upon any\nother person, he determined to devour his chagrin, and extended his\nforgiveness even to Pipes, whom, in the first sally of his passion, he\nhad looked upon in a more criminal light than that of a simple mutineer.\nThis determination was seconded by another, which he thought absolutely\nnecessary for his own repose, and in which his own interest, and that of\nhis nephew, concurred.\n\nPeregrine, who was now turned of twelve, had made such advances under\nthe instruction of Jennings, that he often disputed upon grammar, and\nwas sometimes thought to have the better in his contests, with the\nparish-priest, who, notwithstanding this acknowledged superiority of\nhis antagonist, did great justice to his genius which he assured Mr.\nTrunnion would be lost for want of cultivation, if the boy was not\nimmediately sent to prosecute his studies at some proper seminary of\nlearning.\n\nThis maxim had been more than once inculcated upon the commodore by Mrs.\nTrunnion, who, over and above the deference she paid to the parson's\nopinion, had a reason of her own for wishing to see the house clear\nof Peregrine, at whose prying disposition she began to be very uneasy.\nInduced by these motives, which were joined by the solicitation of the\nyouth himself, who ardently longed to see a little more of the world,\nhis uncle determined to send him forthwith to Winchester, under the\nimmediate care and inspection of a governor, to whom he allowed a very\nhandsome appointment for that purpose. This gentleman, whose name was\nMr. Jacob Jolter, had been school-fellow with the parson of the parish,\nwho recommended him to Mrs. Trunnion as a person of great worth and\nlearning, in every respect qualified for the office of a tutor. He\nlikewise added, by way of eulogium, that he was a man of exemplary\npiety and particularly zealous for the honour of the church, of which\nhe was a member, having been many years in holy orders, though he did\nnot then exercise any function of the priesthood. Indeed, Mr. Jolter's\nzeal was so exceedingly fervent, as, on some occasions, to get the\nbetter of his discretion; for, being a high churchman and of consequence\na malcontent, his resentment was habituated into an insurmountable\nprejudice against the present disposition of affairs, which, by\nconfounding the nation with the ministry, sometimes led him into\nerroneous, not to say absurd calculations; otherwise, a man of good\nmorals, well versed in mathematics and school divinity, studies which\nhad not at all contributed to sweeten and unbend the natural sourness\nand severity of his complexion.\n\nThis gentleman being destined to the charge of superintending Perry's\neducation, everything was prepared for their departure; and Tom Pipes,\nin consequence of his own petition, put into livery, and appointed\nfootman to the young squire. But, before they set out, the commodore\npaid the compliment of communicating his design to Mr. Pickle, who\napproved of the plan, though he durst not venture to see the boy; so\nmuch was he intimidated by the remonstrances of his wife, whose aversion\nto her first-born became every day more inveterate and unaccountable.\nThis unnatural caprice seemed to be supported by a consideration which,\none would imagine, might have rather vanquished her disgust. Her second\nson Gam, who was now in the fourth year of his age, had been rickety\nfrom the cradle, and as remarkably unpromising in appearance as Perry\nwas agreeable in his person. As the deformity increased, the mother's\nfondness was augmented, and the virulence of her hate against the other\nson seemed to prevail in the same proportion.\n\nFar from allowing Perry to enjoy the common privileges of a child,\nshe would not suffer him to approach his father's house, expressed\nuneasiness whenever his name happened to be mentioned, sickened at his\npraise, and in all respects behaved like a most rancorous step-mother.\nThough she no longer retained that ridiculous notion of his being an\nimpostor, she still continued to abhor him, as if she really believed\nhim to be such; and when any person desired to know the cause of her\nsurprising dislike, she always lost her temper, and peevishly replied,\nthat she had reasons of her own, which she was not obliged to declare:\nnay, so much was she infected by this vicious partiality, that she broke\noff all commerce with her sister-in-law and the commodore, because they\nfavoured the poor child with their countenance and protection.\n\nHer malice, however, was frustrated by the love and generosity\nof Trunnion, who, having adopted him as his own son, equipped him\naccordingly, and carried him and his governor in his own coach to the\nplace of destination, where they were settled on a very genteel footing,\nand everything regulated according to their desires.\n\nMrs. Trunnion with great decency at the departure of her nephew, to\nwhom, with a great many pious advices and injunctions to behave with\nsubmission and reverence towards his tutor, she presented a diamond ring\nof small value, and a gold medal, as tokens of her affection and esteem.\nAs for the lieutenant, he accompanied them in the coach; and such was\nthe friendship he had contracted for Perry, that when the commodore\nproposed to return, after having accomplished the intent of his journey,\nJack absolutely refused to attend him, and signified his resolution to\nstay where he was.\n\nTrunnion was the more startled a this declaration, as Hatchway was\nbecome so necessary to him in almost all the purposes of his life, that\nhe foresaw he should not be able to exist without his company. Not a\nlittle affected with this consideration, he turned his eye ruefully\nupon the lieutenant, saying, in a piteous tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! leave me at last,\nJack, after we have weathered so many hard gales together? D-- my limbs!\nI thought you had been more of an honest heart: I looked upon you as my\nforemast, and Tom Pipes as my mizen: now he is carried away, if so be\nas you go too, my standing rigging being decayed, d'ye see, the first\nsquall will bring me by the board. D-- ye, if in case I have given\noffence, can't you speak above-board? and I shall make you amends.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJack, being ashamed to own the true situation of his thoughts, after\nsome hesitation, answered with perplexity and incoherence, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, d--\nme! that an't the case neither: to be sure you always used me in an\nofficer-like manner, that I must own, to give the devil his due, as the\nsaying is; but for all that, this here is the case, I have some thoughts\nof going to school myself to learn your Latin lingo: for, as the saying\nis, Better late mend than never: and I am informed as how one can get\nmore for the money here than anywhere else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn vain did Trunnion endeavour to convince him of the folly of going to\nschool at his years, by representing that the boys would make game of\nhim, and that he would become a laughing-stock to all the world: he\npersisted in his resolution to stay, and the commodore was fain to\nhave recourse to the mediation of Pipes and Perry, who employed their\ninfluence with Jack, and at last prevailed upon him to return to the\ngarrison, after Trunnion had promised he should be at liberty to visit\nthem once a month. This stipulation being settled, he and his friend\ntook leave of the pupil, governor, and attendant, and next morning, set\nout for their habitation, which they reached in safety that same night.\n\nSuch was Hatchway's reluctance to leave Peregrine, that he is said, for\nthe first time in his life, to have looked misty at parting: certain I\nam, that on the road homewards, after a long pause of silence, which the\ncommodore never dreamt of interrupting, he exclaimed all of a sudden,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll be d--d if the dog ha'nt given me some stuff to make me love him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Indeed, there was something congenial in the disposition of these two\nfriends, which never failed to manifest itself in the sequel, howsoever\ndifferent their education, circumstances, and connections happened to\nbe.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n\n\nPeregrine distinguishes himself among his School-fellows, exposes his\nTutor, and attracts the particular Notice of the Master.\n\n\nThus left to the prosecution of his studies, Peregrine was in a\nlittle time a distinguished character, not only for his acuteness of\napprehension, but also for that mischievous fertility of fancy, of which\nwe have already given such pregnant examples. But as there was a great\nnumber of such luminaries in this new sphere to which he belonged, his\ntalents were not so conspicuous while they shone in his single capacity,\nas they afterwards appeared, when they concentrated and reflected the\nrays of the whole constellation.\n\nAt first he confined himself to piddling game, exercising his genius\nupon his own tutor, who attracted his attention, by endeavouring to\nseason his mind with certain political maxims, the fallacy of which he\nhad discernment enough to perceive. Scarce a day passed in which he did\nnot find means to render Mr. Jolter the object of ridicule: his violent\nprejudices, ludicrous vanity, awkward solemnity, and ignorance of\nmankind, afforded continual food for the raillery, petulance, and satire\nof his pupil, who never neglected an opportunity of laughing, and making\nothers laugh, at his expense.\n\nSometimes in their parties, by mixing brandy in his wine, he decoyed\nthis pedagogue into a debauch, during which his caution forsook him, and\nhe exposed himself to the censure of the company. Sometimes, when the\nconversation turned upon intricate subjects, he practised upon him the\nSocratic method of confutation, and, under pretence of being informed,\nby an artful train of puzzling questions insensibly betrayed him into\nself-contradiction.\n\nAll the remains of authority which he had hitherto preserved over\nPeregrine soon vanished; so that, for the future, no sort of ceremony\nsubsisted between them, and all Mr. Jolter's precepts were conveyed in\nhints of friendly advice, which the other might either follow or neglect\nat his own pleasure. No wonder then that Peregrine gave a loose to his\ninclinations, and, by dint of genius and an enterprising temper, made a\nfigure among the younger class of heroes in the school.\n\nBefore he had been a full year at Winchester, he had signallized himself\nin so many achievements, in defiance to the laws and regulations of the\nplace, that he was looked upon with admiration, and actually chosen dux,\nor leader, by a large body of his contemporaries. It was not long\nbefore his fame reached the ears of the master, who sent for Mr. Jolter,\ncommunicated to him the informations he had received, and desired him to\ncheck the vivacity of his charge, and redouble his vigilance in time to\ncome, else he should be obliged to make a public example of his pupil\nfor the benefit of the school.\n\nThe governor, conscious of his own unimportance, was not a little\ndisconcerted at this injunction, which it was not in his power to fulfil\nby any compulsive means. He therefore went home in a very pensive mood,\nand after mature deliberation, resolved to expostulate with Peregrine\nin the most familiar terms, and endeavour to dissuade him from practices\nwhich might affect his character as well as interest. He accordingly\nfrankly told him the subject of the master's discourse; represented the\ndisgrace he might incur by neglecting this warning; and, putting him in\nmind of his own situation, hinted the consequences of the commodore's\ndispleasure, in case he should be brought to disapprove of his conduct.\nThese insinuations made the greater impression as they were delivered\nwith many expressions of friendship and concern. The young gentleman\nwas not so raw, but that he could perceive the solidity of Mr.\nJolter's advice, to which he promised to conform, because his pride was\ninterested in the affair, and he considered his own reformation as the\nonly means of avoiding that infamy which even in idea he could not bear.\n\nHis governor, finding him so reasonable, profited by these moments of\nreflection; and, in order to prevent a relapse, proposed that he\nshould engage in some delightful study that would agreeably amuse his\nimagination, and gradually detach him from those connections which had\ninvolved him in so many troublesome adventures. For this purpose, he,\nwith many rapturous encomiums, recommended the mathematics, as yielding\nmore rational and sensible pleasures to a youthful fancy than any other\nsubject of contemplation; and actually began to read Euclid with him\nthat same afternoon.\n\nPeregrine entered upon this branch of learning with all that warmth of\napplication which boys commonly yield on the first change of study; but\nhe had scarce advanced beyond the Pons Asinorum, when his ardour\nabated; the test of truth by demonstration did not elevate him to those\ntransports of joy with which his preceptor had regaled his expectation;\nand before he arrived at the forty-seventh proposition, he began to\nyawn drearily, make abundance of wry faces, and thought himself but\nindifferently paid for his attention, when he shared the vast discovery\nof Pythagoras, and understood that the square of the hypotenuse was\nequal to the squares of the other two sides of a right-angled triangle.\nHe was ashamed, however, to fail in his undertaking, and persevered with\ngreat industry, until he had finished the first four books, acquired\nplane trigonometry, with the method of algebraical calculation, and\nmade himself well acquainted with the principles of surveying. But no\nconsideration could prevail upon him to extend his inquiries farther\nin this science; and he returned with double relish to his former\navocations, like a stream, which, being dammed, accumulates more force,\nand, bursting over its mounds, rushes down with double impetuosity.\n\nMr. Jolter saw with astonishment and chagrin, but could not resist the\ntorrent. His behaviour was now no other than a series of license and\neffrontery; prank succeeded prank, and outrage followed outrage with\nsurprising velocity. Complaints were every day preferred against him; in\nvain were admonitions bestowed by the governor in private, and menaces\ndischarged by the masters in public; he disregarded the first, despised\nthe latter, divested himself of all manner of restraint, and proceeded\nin his career to such a pitch of audacity, that a consultation was held\nupon the subject, in which it was determined that this untoward spirit\nshould be humbled by a severe and ignominious flogging for the very next\noffence he should commit. In the mean time, Mr. Jolter was desired to\nwrite in the masters name to the commodore, requesting him to remove Tom\nPipes from the person of his nephew, the said Pipes being a principal\nactor and abettor in all his malversations; and to put a stop to the\nmonthly visitations of the mutilated lieutenant, who had never once\nfailed to use his permission, but came punctual to a day, always fraught\nwith some new invention. Indeed, by this time Mr. Hatchway was as well\nknown, and much better beloved, by every boy in the school than the\nmaster who instructed him, and always received by a number of scholars,\nwho used to attend Peregrine when he went forth to meet his friend, and\nconduct him to his lodging with public testimonies of joy and applause.\n\nAs for Tom Pipes, he was not so properly the attendant of Peregrine,\nas master of the revels of the whole school. He mingled in all their\nparties, and superintended the diversions, deciding between boy and boy,\nas if he acted by commission under the great seal. He regulated their\nmotions by his whistle, instructed the young boys in the games of\nhustle-cap, leap-frog, and chuck-farthing; imparted to those of a more\nadvanced age the sciences of cribbage and all-fours, together with the\nmethod of storming the castle, acting the comedy of Prince Arthur, and\nother pantomimes, as they commonly exhibited at sea; and instructed\nthe seniors, who were distinguished by the appellation of bloods, in\ncudgel-playing, dancing the St. Giles's hornpipe, drinking flip, and\nsmoking tobacco. These qualifications had rendered him so necessary and\nacceptable to the scholars, that exclusive of Perry's concern in the\naffair, his dismission, in all probability, would have produced some\ndangerous convulsion in the community. Jolter, therefore, knowing his\nimportance, informed his pupil of the directions he had received, and\nvery candidly asked how he should demean himself in the execution;\nfor he durst not write to the commodore without this previous notice,\nfearing that the young gentleman, as soon as he should get an inkling of\nthe affair, would follow the example, and make his uncle acquainted\nwith certain anecdotes, which it was the governor's interest to keep\nconcealed. Peregrine was of opinion that he should spare himself the\ntrouble of conveying any complaints to the commodore; and if questioned\nby the master, assure him he had complied with his desire: at the same\ntime he promised faithfully to conduct himself with such circumspection\nfor the future, that the masters should have no temptation to revive\nthe inquiry. But the resolution attending this extorted promise was too\nfrail to last, and in less than a fortnight our young hero found himself\nentangled in an adventure from which he was not extricated with his\nusual good fortune.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n\n\nHe is concerned in a dangerous Adventure with a certain\nGardener--Sublimes his Ideas, commences Gallant, and becomes acquainted\nwith Miss Emily Gauntlet.\n\n\nHe and some of his companions one day entered a garden in the suburbs,\nand, having indulged their appetites, desired to know what satisfaction\nthey must make for the fruit they had pulled. The gardener demanded\nwhat, in their opinion, was an exorbitant price, and they with many\nopprobrious terms refused to pay it. The peasant, being surly and\nuntractable, insisted upon his right; neither was he deficient or\nsparing in the eloquence of vulgar abuse. His guests attempted to\nretreat; a scuffle ensued, in which Peregrine lost his cap; and the\ngardener, being in danger from the number of his foes, called to\nhis wife to let loose the dog, which instantly flew to his master's\nassistance, and, after having torn the leg of one and the shoulder\nof another, put the whole body of scholars to flight. Enraged at the\nindignity which had been offered them, they solicited a reinforcement\nof their friends, and, with Tom Pipes at their head, marched back to\nthe field of battle. Their adversary, seeing them approach, called\nhis apprentice, who worked at the other end of the ground, to his\nassistance, armed him with a mattock, while he himself wielded a hoe,\nbolted his door on the inside, and, flanked with his man and mastiff,\nwaited the attack without flinching.\n\nHe had not remained three minutes in this posture of defence, when\nPipes, who acted as the enemy's forlorn hope, advanced to the gate with\ngreat intrepidity, and, clapping his foot to the door, which was none of\nthe stoutest, with the execution and despatch of a petard, split it into\na thousand pieces. This sudden execution had an immediate effect upon\nthe apprentice, who retreated with great precipitation, and escaped at\na postern; but the master placed himself, like another Hercules, in\nthe breach; and when Pipes, brandishing his cudgel, stepped forward to\nengage him, leveled his weapon with such force and dexterity at his\nhead, that had the skull been made of penetrable stuff, the iron edge\nmust have cleft his pate in twain. Casemated as he was, the instrument\ncut sheer even to the bone, on which it struck with such amazing\nviolence, that sparks of real fire were produced by the collision.\nAnd let not the incredulous reader pretend to doubt the truth of this\nphenomenon, until he shall have first perused the ingenious Peter\nKolben's Natural History of the Cape of Good Hope, where the inhabitants\ncommonly used to strike fire with the shin-bones of lions which had been\nkilled in that part of Africa.\n\nPipes, though a little disconcerted, far from being disabled by the\nblow, in a trice retorted the compliment with his truncheon, which, had\nnot his antagonist expeditiously slipped his head aside, would have\nlaid him breathless across his own threshold; but, happily for him, he\nreceived the salutation upon his right shoulder, which crashed beneath\nthe stroke, and the hoe dropped instantly from his tingling hand. Tom,\nperceiving, and being unwilling to forego, the advantage he had gained,\ndarted his head into the bosom of this son of earth, and overturned him\non the plain, being himself that instant assaulted by the mastiff, who\nfastened upon the outside of his thigh. Feeling himself incommoded by\nthis assailant in his rear, he quitted the prostrate gardener to the\nresentment of his associates, who poured upon him in shoals, and turning\nabout, laid hold with both his hands of this ferocious animal's throat,\nwhich he squeezed with such incredible force and perseverance, that the\ncreature quitted his hold; his tongue lolled out of his jaws, the blood\nstarted from his eyes, and he swung a lifeless trunk between the hands\nof his vanquisher.\n\nIt was well for his master that he did not longer exist: for by this\ntime he was overwhelmed by such a multitude of foes, that his whole body\nscarce afforded points of contact to all the fists that drummed upon\nhim; consequently, to use a vulgar phrase, his wind was almost knocked\nout, before Pipes had leisure to interpose in his he behalf, and\npersuade his offenders to desist, by representing that the wife had\ngone to alarm the neighbourhood, and in all probability they would\nbe intercepted in their return. They accordingly listened to his\nremonstrances, and marched homewards in triumph, leaving the gardener\nin the embraces of his mother earth, from which he had not power to move\nwhen he was found by his disconsolate helpmate and some friends whom\nshe had assembled for his assistance. Among these was a blacksmith and\nfarrier, who took cognizance of his carcase, every limb of which having\nexamined, he declared there was no bone broken, and taking out his\nfleam, blooded him plentifully as he lay. He was then conveyed to his\nbed, from which he was not able to stir during a whole month. His family\ncoming upon the parish, a formal complaint was made to the master of\nthe school, and Peregrine represented as the ringleader of those who\ncommitted this barbarous assault. An inquiry was immediately set on\nfoot; and the articles of impeachment being fully proved, our hero was\nsentenced to be severely chastised in the face of the whole school. This\nwas a disgrace, the thoughts of which his proud heart could not brook.\nHe resolved to make his elopement rather than undergo the punishment\nto which he was doomed; and having signified his sentiments to his\nconfederates, they promised one and all to stand by him, and either\nscreen him from chastisement or share his fate.\n\nConfiding in this friendly protestation, he appeared unconcerned on the\nday that was appointed for his punishment; and when he was called to\nhis destiny, advanced the scene, attended by the greatest part of the\nscholars, who intimated their determination to the master, and proposed\nthat Peregrine should be forgiven. The superior behaved with that\ndignity of demeanour which became his place, represented the folly\nand presumption of their demand, reprehended them for their audacious\nproceeding, and ordered every boy to his respective station. They obeyed\nhis command, and our unfortunate hero was publicly horsed, in terrorem\nof all whom it might concern.\n\nThis disgrace had a very sensible effect upon the mind of Peregrine,\nwho, having by this time, passed the fourteenth year of his age,\nbegan to adopt the pride and sentiments of a man. Thus dishonourably\nstigmatized, he was ashamed to appear in public as usual; he was\nincensed against his companions for their infidelity and irresolution,\nand plunged into a profound reverie that lasted several weeks, during\nwhich he shook off his boyish connections, and fixed his view upon\nobjects which he thought more worthy of his attention.\n\nIn the course of his gymnastic exercises, at which he was very expert,\nhe contracted intimacies with several youths who were greatly his\nsuperiors in point of age, and who, pleased with his aspiring genius\nand address, introduced him into parties of gallantry which strongly\ncaptivated his inclination. He was by nature particularly adopted\nfor succeeding in all adventures of this kind: over and above a most\nengaging person that improved with his years, he possessed a dignified\nassurance, an agreeable ferocity which enhanced the conquest of the fair\nwho had the good fortune to enslave him, unlimited generosity, and a\nfund of humour which never failed to please. Nor was he deficient in\nthe more solid accomplishments of youth: he had profited in his studies\nbeyond expectation; and besides that sensibility of discernment which\nis the foundation of taste, and in consequence of which he distinguished\nand enjoyed the beauties of the classics, he had already given several\nspecimens of a very promising poetic talent.\n\nWith this complexion and these qualifications, no wonder that our hero\nattracted the notice and affections of the young Delias in town, whose\nhearts had just begun to flutter for they knew not what. Inquiries\nwere made concerning his condition; and no sooner were his expectations\nknown, than he was invited and caressed by all the parents, while\nthe daughters vied with each other in treating him with particular\ncomplacency. He inspired love and emulation wherever he appeared: envy\nand jealous rage followed of course; so that he became a very desirable,\nthough a very dangerous acquaintance. His moderation was not equal to\nhis success: his vanity took the lead of his passions, dissipating his\nattention, which might otherwise have fixed him to one object; and he\nwas possessed with the rage of increasing the number of his conquests.\nWith this view he frequented public walks, concerts, and assemblies,\nbecame remarkably rich and fashionable in his clothes, gave\nentertainments to the ladies, and was in the utmost hazard of turning\nout a most egregious coxcomb.\n\nWhile his character thus wavered between the ridicule of some and the\nregard of others, an accident happened which by contracting his view\nto one object, detached him from those vain pursuits that would in time\nhave plunged him into an abyss of folly and contempt. Being one evening\nat the ball which is always given to the ladies at the time of the\nraces, the person acted as master of the ceremonies, knowing how fond\nMr. Pickle was of every opportunity to display himself, came up, and\ntold him, that there was a fine young creature at the other end of the\nroom, who seemed to have a great inclination to dance a minuet, but\nwanted a partner, the gentleman who attended her being in boots.\n\nPeregrine's vanity being aroused at this intimation, he went up to\nreconnoitre the young lady, and was struck with admiration at her\nbeauty. She seemed to be of his own age, was tall, though slender,\nexquisitely shaped; her hair was auburn, and in such plenty, that the\nbarbarity of dress had not been able to prevent it from shading both\nsides of her forehead, which was high and polished; the contour of her\nface was oval; her nose very little raised into the aquiline form,\nthat contributed to the spirit and dignity of her aspect; her mouth was\nsmall; her lips plump, juicy, and delicious, her teeth regular and white\nas driven snow, her complexion incredibly delicate, and glowing with\nhealth; and her full blue eyes beamed forth vivacity and love: her mien\nwas at the same time commanding and engaging, her address perfectly\ngenteel, and her whole appearance so captivating, that our young Adonis\nlooked, and was overcome.\n\nHe no sooner recollected himself from his astonishment, than he advanced\nto her with a graceful air of respect, and begged she would do him the\nhonour to walk a minuet with him. She seemed particularly pleased with\nhis application, and very frankly complied with his request. This pair\nwas too remarkable to escape the particular notice of the company; Mr.\nPickle was well known by almost everybody in the room, but his partner\nwas altogether a new face and of consequence underwent the criticism\nof all the ladies in the assembly. One whispered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has a good\ncomplexion, but don't you think she is a little awry?\u00e2\u0080\u009d a second pitied\nher for her masculine nose; a third observed, that she was awkward for\nwant of seeing company; a fourth distinguished something very bold in\nher countenance; and, in short, there was not a beauty in her whole\ncomposition which the glass of envy did not pervert into a blemish.\n\nThe men, however, looked upon her with different eyes; among them her\nappearance produced a universal murmur of applause: they encircled the\nspace on which she danced, and were enchanted by her graceful motion.\nWhile they launched out in the praise of her, they expressed their\ndispleasure at the good fortune of her partner, whom they d--d for a\nlittle finical coxcomb, that was too much engrossed by the contemplation\nof his own person, to discern or deserve the favour of his fate. He did\nnot hear, therefore could not repine at these invectives; but while they\nimagined he indulged his vanity, a much more generous passion had taken\npossession of his heart.\n\nInstead of that petulance of gaiety for which he had been distinguished\nin his public appearance, he now gave manifest signs of confusion and\nconcern: he danced with an anxiety which impeded his performance,\nand blushed to the eyes at every false step he made. Though this\nextraordinary agitation was overlooked by the men, it could not escape\nthe observation of the ladies, who perceived it with equal surprise\nand resentment; and when Peregrine led this fair unknown to her seat,\nexpressed their pique in an affected titter, which broke from every\nmouth at the same instant--as if all of them had been informed by the\nsame spirit.\n\nPeregrine was nettled at this unmannerly mark of disapprobation, and,\nin order to increase their chagrin, endeavoured to enter into particular\nconversation with their fair rival. The young lady herself, who neither\nwanted penetration nor the consciousness of her own accomplishments,\nresented their behaviour, though she triumphed at the cause of it, and\ngave her partner all the encouragement he could desire. Her mother, who\nwas present, thanked him for his civility in taking such notice of a\nstranger, and he received a compliment of the same nature from the young\ngentleman in boots, who was her own brother.\n\nIf he was charmed with her appearance, he was quite ravished with\nher discourse, which was sensible, spirited, and gay. Her frank and\nsprightly demeanour excited his own confidence and good-humour; and he\ndescribed to her the characters of those females who had honoured them\nwith such a spiteful mark of distinction, in terms so replete with\nhumorous satire, that she seemed to listen with particular complacency\nof attention, and distinguished every nymph thus ridiculed with such a\nsignificant glance as overwhelmed her with chagrin and mortification. In\nshort, they seemed to relish each other's conversation, during which\nour young Damon acquitted himself with great skill in all the duties\nof gallantry: he laid hold of proper opportunities to express his\nadmiration of her charms, had recourse to the silent rhetoric of tender\nlooks, breathed divers insidious sighs, and attached himself wholly to\nher during the remaining part of the entertainment.\n\nWhen the company broke up, he attended her to her lodgings, and\ntook leave of her with a squeeze of the hand, after having obtained\npermission to visit her next morning, and been informed by the mother\nthat her name was Miss Emilia Gauntlet.\n\nAll night long he closed not an eye, but amused himself with plans of\npleasure, which his imagination suggested in consequence of this new\nacquaintance. He rose with the lark, adjusted his hair into an agreeable\nnegligence of curl, and dressing himself in a genteel gray frock trimmed\nwith silver binding, waited with the utmost impatience for the hour\nof ten, which no sooner struck than he hied him to the place of\nappointment, and inquiring for Miss gauntlet, was shown into a parlour.\nHere he had not waited above ten minutes, when Emilia entered in a most\nenchanting undress, with all the graces of nature playing about her\nperson, and in a moment riveted the chains of his slavery beyond the\npower of accident to unbind.\n\nHer mother being still abed, and her brother gone to give orders about\nthe chaise, in which they proposed to return that same day to their\nown habitation, he enjoyed her company a whole hour, during which he\ndeclared his love in the most passionate terms, and begged that he might\nbe admitted into the number of those admirers whom she permitted to\nvisit and adore her.\n\nShe affected to look upon his vows and protestations as the ordinary\neffect of gallantry, and very obligingly assured him that were she to\nlive in that place she should be glad to see him often; but as the\nspot on which she resided was at a considerable distance, she could not\nexpect he would go so far, upon such a trifling occasion, as to take the\ntrouble of providing himself with her mamma's permission.\n\nTo this favourable hint he with all the eagerness of the most fervent\npassion, that he had uttered nothing but the genuine dictates of his\nheart; that he desired nothing so much as an opportunity of evincing the\nsincerity of his professions; and that, though he lived at the extremity\nof the kingdom, he would find means to lay himself at her feet, provided\nhe could visit her with her mother's consent, which he assured her he\nwould not fail to solicit.\n\nShe then gave him to understand that her habitation was about sixteen\nmiles from Winchester, in a village which she named, and where, as he\ncould easily collect from her discourse, he would be no unwelcome guest.\n\nIn the midst of this communication they were joined by Mrs. Gauntlet,\nwho received him with great courtesy, thanking him again for his\npoliteness to Emy at the ball, and anticipated his intention by saying\nthat she should be very glad to see him at her house, if ever his\noccasions should call him that way.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n\n\nHe inquires into the Situation of this young Lady, with whom he is\nenamoured--Elopes from School--Is found by the Lieutenant, conveyed to\nWinchester, and sends a Letter with a copy of verses to his Mistress.\n\n\nHe was transported with pleasure at this invitation, which he assured\nher he should not neglect; and after a little more conversation on\ngeneral topics, took his leave of the charming Emilia and her prudent\nmamma, who had perceived the first emotions of Mr. Pickle's passion for\nher daughter, and been at some pains to inquire about his family and\nfortune.\n\nNeither was Peregrine less inquisitive about the situation and pedigree\nof his new mistress, who, he learned, was the only daughter of a\nfield-officer, who died before he had it in his power to make suitable\nprovision for his children; that the widow lived in a frugal though\ndecent manner on her pension, assisted by the bounty of her relations;\nthat the son carried arms as a volunteer in the company which his father\nhad commanded; and that Emilia had been educated in London, at the\nexpense of a rich uncle, who was seized with the whim of marrying at the\nage of fifty-five; in consequence of which his niece had returned to her\nmother, without any visible dependence, except on her own conduct and\nqualifications.\n\nThis account, though it could not diminish his affection, nevertheless\nalarmed his pride; for his warm imagination had exaggerated all his own\nprospects; and he began to fear that his passion for Emilia might be\nthought to derogate from the dignity of his situation. The struggle\nbetween his interest and love produced a perplexity which had an evident\neffect upon his behaviour: he became pensive, solitary, and peevish;\navoided public diversions; and grew so remarkably negligent in his\ndress, that he was scarce distinguishable by his own acquaintance. This\ncontention of thoughts continued several weeks, at the end of which\nthe charms of Emilia triumphed over every other consideration. Having\nreceived a supply of money from the commodore, who acted towards him\nwith great generosity, he ordered Pipes to put up some linen and other\nnecessaries in a sort of knapsack, which he could conveniently carry;\nand, thus attended, set out early one morning on foot for the village\nwhere his charmer lived, at which he arrived before two o'clock in the\nafternoon; having chosen this method of travelling that his route might\nnot be so easily discovered, as it must have been had he hired horses,\nor taken a place in the stage-coach.\n\nThe first thing he did was to secure a convenient lodging at the inn\nwhere he dined; then he shifted himself, and, according to the direction\nhe had received, went to the house of Mrs. Gauntlet in a transport of\njoyous expectation. As he approached the gate, his agitation increased;\nhe knocked with impatience and concern, the door opened, and he had\nactually asked if Mrs. Gauntlet was at home, before he perceived that\nthe portress was no other than his dear Emilia. She was not without\nemotion at the unexpected sight of her lover, who instantly recognising\nhis charmer obeyed the irresistible impulse of his love, and caught the\nfair creature in his arms. Nor did she seem offended at this forwardness\nof behaviour, which might have displeased another of a less open\ndisposition, or less used to the freedom of a sensible education; but\nher natural frankness had been encouraged and improved by the easy and\nfamiliar intercourse in which she had been bred; and therefore, instead\nof reprimanding him with a severity of look, she with great good humour\nrallied him upon his assurance, which, she observed, was undoubtedly\nthe effect of his own conscious merit; and conducted him into a parlour,\nwhere he found her mother, who, in very polite terms, expressed her\nsatisfaction at seeing him within her house.\n\nAfter tea, Miss Emy proposed an evening walk, which they enjoyed through\na variety of little copses and lawns, watered by a most romantic stream,\nthat quite enchanted the imagination of Peregrine.\n\nIt was late before they returned from this agreeable excursion, and when\nour lover wished the ladies good night, Mrs. Gauntlet insisted upon his\nstaying to supper, and treated him with particular demonstrations\nof regard and affection. As her economy was not encumbered with an\nunnecessary number of domestics, her own presence was often required in\ndifferent parts of the house, so that the young gentleman was supplied\nwith frequent opportunities of promoting his suit by all the tender\noaths and insinuations that his passion could suggest. He protested her\nidea had taken such entire possession of his heart, that finding\nhimself unable to support her absence one day longer, he had quitted\nhis studies, and left his governor by stealth, that he might visit the\nobject of his adoration, and be blessed in her company for a few days\nwithout interruption.\n\nShe listened to his addresses with such affability as denoted\napprobation and delight, and gently chided him as a thoughtless truant,\nbut carefully avoided the confession of a mutual flame; because she\ndiscerned, in the midst of all his tenderness, a levity of pride which\nshe durst not venture to trust with such a declaration. Perhaps she\nwas confirmed in this caution by her mother, who very wisely, in her\ncivilities to him, maintained a sort of ceremonious distance, which she\nthought not only requisite for the honour and interest of her family,\nbut likewise for her own exculpation, should she ever be taxed with\nhaving encouraged or abetted him in the imprudent sallies of his youth;\nyet, notwithstanding this affected reserve, he was treated with such\ndistinction by both, that he was ravished with his situation, and became\nmore and more enamoured every day.\n\nWhile he remained under the influence of this sweet intoxication,\nhis absence produced great disturbance at Winchester. Mr. Jolter was\ngrievously afflicted at his abrupt departure, which alarmed him the\nmore, as it happened after a long fit of melancholy which he had\nperceived in his pupil. He communicated his apprehensions to the master\nof the school, who advised him to apprise the commodore of his nephew's\ndisappearance, and in the mean time inquire at all the inns in\ntown, whether he had hired horses, or any sort of carriage, for his\nconveyance, or was met with on the road by any person who could give an\naccount of the direction in which he travelled.\n\nThe scrutiny, though performed with great diligence and minuteness,\nwas altogether ineffectual; they could obtain no intelligence of the\nrunaway. Mr. Trunnion was well distracted at the news of his flight; he\nraved with great fury at the imprudence of Peregrine, whom in his first\ntransports he d--d as an ungrateful deserter; then he cursed Hatchway\nand Pipes, who he swore had foundered the lad by their pernicious\ncounsels; and, lastly, transferred his execrations upon Jolter, because\nhe had not kept a better look-out; finally, he made an apostrophe to\nthat son of a b-- the gout, which for the present disabled him from\nsearching for his nephew in person. That he might not, however, neglect\nany means in his power, he immediately despatched expresses to all the\nsea-port towns on that coast, that he might be prevented from leaving\nthe kingdom; and the lieutenant, at his own desire, was sent across the\ncountry, in quest of this young fugitive.\n\nFour days had he unsuccessfully carried on his inquiries with great\naccuracy, when, resolving to return by Winchester, where he hoped to\nmeet with some hints of intelligence by which he might profit in his\nfuture search, he struck off the common road to take the benefit of a\nnearer cut; and finding himself benighted near a village, took up\nhis lodgings at the first inn to which his horse directed him. Having\nbespoke something for supper, and retired to his chamber, where he\namused himself with a pipe, he heard a confused noise of rustic jollity,\nwhich being all of a sudden interrupted, after a short pause his ear\nwas saluted with the voice of Pipes, who, at the solicitation of the\ncompany, began to entertain them with a song.\n\nHatchway instantly recognised the well-known sound, in which, indeed,\nhe could not possibly be mistaken, as nothing in nature bore the least\nresemblance to it; he threw his pipe into the chimney, and, snatching\nup one of his pistols, ran immediately to the apartment from whence\nthe voice issued; he no sooner entered, than, distinguishing his old\nship-mate in a crowd of country peasants, he in a moment sprang upon\nhim, and, clapping his pistol to his breast, exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009c D--n you,\nPipes, you are a dead man, if you don't immediately produce young\nmaster.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis menacing application had a much greater effect upon the company\nthan upon Tom, who, looking at the lieutenant with great tranquility,\nreplied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy so I can, Master Hatchway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! safe and sound?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried\nthe other. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a roach,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Pipes, so much to the satisfaction\nof his friend Jack, that he shook him by the hand, and desired him\nto proceed with his song. This being performed and the reckoning\ndischarged, the two friends adjourned to the other room, where the\nlieutenant was informed of the manner in which the young gentleman had\nmade his elopement from college, as well as of the other particulars of\nhis present situation, as far as they had fallen within the sphere of\nhis comprehension.\n\nWhile they sat thus conferring together, Peregrine, having taken\nleave of his mistress for the night, came home, and was not a little\nsurprised, when Hatchway, entering his chamber in his sea attitude,\nthrust out his hand by way of salutation. His old pupil received him as\nusual, with great cordiality, and expressed his astonishment at meeting\nhim in that place; but when he understood the cause and intention of\nhis arrival, he started with concern; and, his visage glowing with\nindignation, told him he was old enough to be judge of his own conduct,\nand, when he should see it convenient, would return of himself; but\nthose who thought he was to be compelled to his duty, would find\nthemselves egregiously mistaken.\n\nThe lieutenant assured him, that for his own part he had no intention to\noffer him the least violence; but, at the same time, he represented\nto him the danger of incensing the commodore, who was already almost\ndistracted on account of his absence: and, in short, conveyed his\narguments, which were equally obvious and valid, in such expressions of\nfriendship and respect, that Peregrine yielded to his remonstrances, and\npromised to accompany him next day to Winchester.\n\nHatchway, overjoyed at the success of his negotiation, went immediately\nto the hostler and bespoke a post-chaise for Mr. Pickle and his man with\nwhom he afterwards indulged himself in a double can of rumbo, and, when\nthe night was pretty far advanced, left the lover to his repose, or\nrather to the thorns of his own meditation; for he slept not one moment,\nbeing incessantly tortured with the prospect of parting with his divine\nEmilia, who had now acquired the most absolute empire over his soul. One\nminute he proposed to depart early in the morning, without seeing this\nenchantress, in whose bewitching presence he durst not trust his own\nresolution; then the thoughts of leaving her in such an abrupt and\ndisrespectful manner interposed in favour of his love and honour. This\nwar of sentiments kept him all night upon the rack, and it was time to\nrise before he had determined to visit his charmer, and candidly impart\nthe motives that induced him to leave her.\n\nHe accordingly repaired to her mother's house with a heavy heart, being\nattended to the gate by Hatchway, who did not choose to leave him alone;\nand being admitted, found Emilia just risen, and, in his opinion, more\nbeautiful than ever.\n\nAlarmed at his early visit, and the gloom that overspread his\ncountenance, she stood in silent expectation of hearing some melancholy\ntidings; and it was not till after a considerable pause, that he\ncollected resolution enough to tell her he was come to take his\nleave. Though she strove to conceal her sorrow, nature was not to be\nsuppressed: every feature of her countenance saddened in a moment; and\nit was not without the utmost difficulty that she kept her lovely eyes\nfrom overflowing. He saw the situation of her thoughts, and, in order to\nalleviate her concern, assured her he should find means to see her\nagain in a very few weeks: meanwhile he communicated his reasons for\ndeparting, in which she readily acquiesced; and having mutually consoled\neach other, their transports of grief subsided: and before Mrs. Gauntlet\ncame downstairs, they were in a condition to behave with great decency\nand resignation.\n\nThis good lady expressed her concern when she learned his resolution,\nsaying, she hoped his occasions and inclinations would permit him to\nfavour them with his agreeable company another time.\n\nThe lieutenant, who began to be uneasy at Peregrine's stay, knocked\nat the door, and, being introduced by his friend, had the honour of\nbreakfasting with the ladies; on which occasion his heart received such\na rude shock from the charms of Emilia, that he afterwards made a merit\nwith his friend of having constrained himself so far, as to forbear\ncommencing his professed rival.\n\nAt length they bade adieu to their kind entertainers; and in less\nthan an hour setting out from the inn, arrived about two o'clock\nin Winchester, where Mr. Jolter was overwhelmed with joy at their\nappearance.\n\nThe nature of this adventure being unknown to all except those who could\nbe depended upon, everybody who inquired about the cause of Peregrine's\nabsence, was told that he had been with a relation in the country, and\nthe master condescended to overlook his indiscretion; so that Hatchway,\nseeing everything settled to the satisfaction of his friend, returned to\nthe garrison, and gave the commodore an account of his expedition.\n\nThe old gentleman was very much startled when he heard there was a lady\nin the case, and very emphatically observed, that a man had better be\nsucked into the gulf of Florida than once get into the indraught of a\nwoman; because, in one case, he may with good pilotage bring out his\nvessel safe between the Bahamas and the Indian shore; but in the other\nthere is no outlet at all, and it is in vain to strive against the\ncurrent; so that of course he must be embayed, and run chuck upon a\nlee-shore. He resolved, therefore, to lay the state of the case before\nGamaliel Pickle, and concert such measures with him as should be thought\nlikeliest to detach his son from the pursuit of an idle amour, which\ncould not fail of interfering in a dangerous manner with the plan of his\neducation.\n\nIn the mean time, Perry's ideas were totally engrossed by his amiable\nmistress, who, whether he slept or waked, was still present in his\nimagination, which produced the following stanzas in her praise:--\n\n    Adieu! ye streams that smoothly flow;\n    Ye vernal airs that softly blow;\n    Ye plains, by blooming spring arrayed;\n    Ye  birds that warble through the shade.\n\n    Unhurt from you my soul could fly,\n    Nor drop one tear, nor heave one sigh;\n    But forced from Celia's charms to part,\n    All joy deserts my drooping heart.\n\n    O' fairer than the rosy morn,\n    When flowers the dewy fields adorn;\n    Unsallied as the genial ray,\n    That warms the balmy breeze of May;\n\n    Thy charms divinely bright appear,\n    And add new splendour to the year;\n    Improve the day with fresh delight,\n    And gild with joy the dreary night.\n\n\nThis juvenile production was enclosed in a very tender billet to Emilia,\nand committed to the charge of Pipes, who was ordered to set out for\nMrs. Gauntlet's habitation with a present of venison, and a compliment\nto the ladies; and directed to take some opportunity of delivering the\nletter to miss, without the knowledge of her mamma.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n\n\nHis Messenger meets with a Misfortune, to which he applies a very\nextraordinary Expedient that is attended with strange Consequences.\n\n\nAs a stage-coach passed within two miles of the village where she lived,\nTom bargained with the driver for a seat on the box, and accordingly\ndeparted on this message, though he was but indifferently qualified for\ncommissions of such a nature. Having received particular injunctions\nabout the letter, he resolved to make that the chief object of his care,\nand very sagaciously conveyed it between the stocking and the sole of\nhis foot, where he thought it would be perfectly secure from all injury\nor accident. Here it remained until he arrived at the inn where he had\nformerly lodged, when, after having refreshed himself with a draught of\nbeer, he pulled off his stocking, and found the poor billet sullied\nwith dust, and torn in a thousand tatters by the motion of his foot\nin walking the last two miles of his journey. Thunderstruck at\nthis phenomenon, he uttered it loud whew! which was succeeded by an\nexclamation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cD-- my old shoes! a bite by G--!\u00e2\u0080\u009d then he rested his\nelbows on the table, and his forehead upon his two fists, and in that\nattitude deliberated with himself upon the means of remedying this\nmisfortune.\n\nAs he was not distracted by a vast number of ideas he soon concluded\nthat his best expedient would be to employ the clerk of the parish, who\nhe knew was a great scholar, to write another epistle according to\nthe directions he should give him; and never dreaming that the mangled\noriginal would in the least facilitate this scheme, he very wisely\ncommitted it to the flames, that it might never rise up in judgment\nagainst him.\n\nHaving taken this wise step, he went in quest of the scribe, to whom\nhe communicated his business, and promised a full pot by way of\ngratification. The clerk, who was also schoolmaster, proud of an\nopportunity to distinguish his talents, readily undertook the task; and\nrepairing with his employer to the inn, in less than a quarter of an\nhour produced a morsel of eloquence so much to the satisfaction of\nPipes, that he squeezed his hand by way of acknowledgment, and doubled\nhis allowance of beer. This being discussed, our courier betook himself\nto the house of Mrs. Gauntlet with the haunch of venison and this\nsuccedaneous letter, and delivered his message to the mother, who\nreceived it with great respect, and many kind inquiries about the health\nand welfare of his master, attempting to tip the messenger a crown,\nwhich he absolutely refused to accept, in consequence of Mr. Pickle's\nrepeated caution. While the old gentlewoman turned to a servant in order\nto give directions about the disposal of the present, Pipes looked upon\nthis as a favourable occasion to transact his business with Emilia, and\ntherefore shutting one eye, with a jerk of his thumb towards his left\nshoulder, and a most significant twist of his countenance he beckoned\nthe young lady into another room as if he had been fraught with\nsomething of consequence, which he wanted to impart. She understood the\nhint, howsoever strangely communicated, and, by stepping to one side of\nthe room gave him an opportunity of slipping the epistle into her hand,\nwhich he gently squeezed at the same time in token of regard: then\nthrowing a side-glance at the mother, whose back was turned, clapped\nhis finger on the side of his nose, thereby recommending secrecy and\ndiscretion.\n\nEmilia, conveying the letter into her bosom, could not help smiling at\nTom's politeness and dexterity; but lest her mamma should detect him in\nthe execution of his pantomime, she broke off this intercourse of signs,\nby asking aloud when he proposed to set out on his return to Winchester?\nWhen he answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo-morrow morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miss Gauntlet recommended him\nto the hospitality of her own footman, desiring him to make much of\nMr. Pipes below, where he was kept to supper, and very cordially\nentertained. Our young heroine, impatient to read her lover's billet,\nwhich made her heart throb with rapturous expectation, retired to her\nchamber as soon as possible, with a view of perusing the contents, which\nwere these:--\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cDivine Empress Of My Soul,--If the refulgent flames of your\n    beauty had not evaporated the particles of my transported\n    brain, and scorched my intellects into a cinder of stolidity,\n    perhaps the resplendency of my passion might shine illustrious\n    through the sable curtain of my ink, and in sublimity transcend\n    the galaxy itself, though wafted on the pinions of a gray goose\n    quill! But, ah! celestial enchantress! the necromancy of thy\n    tyrannical charms hath fettered my faculties with adamantine\n    chains, which, unless thy compassion shall melt I must eternally\n    remain in the Tartarean gulf of dismal despair. Vouchsafe,\n    therefore, O thou brightest luminary of this terrestrial sphere!\n    to warm, as well as shine; and let the genial rays of thy\n    benevolence melt the icy emanations of thy disdain, which hath\n    frozen up the spirits of angelic pre-eminence.--Thy most\n    egregious admirer and superlative slave,\n                                     \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeregrine Pickle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nNever was astonishment more perplexing than that of Emilia, when she\nread this curious composition, which she repeated verbatim three times\nbefore she would credit the evidence of her own senses. She began to\nfear in good earnest that love had produced a disorder in her lover's\nunderstanding; but after a thousand conjectures by which she attempted\nto account for this extraordinary fustian of style, she concluded that\nit was the effect of mere levity, calculated to ridicule the passion he\nhad formerly professed. Irritated by this supposition, she resolved\nto balk his triumph with affected indifference, and in the mean time\nendeavoured to expel him from that place which he possessed within her\nheart. And indeed such a victory over her inclinations might have been\nobtained without great difficulty; for she enjoyed an easiness of temper\nthat could accommodate itself to the emergencies of her fate; and her\nvivacity, by amusing her imagination, preserved herself from the keener\nsensations of sorrow. Thus determined and disposed, she did not send\nany sort of answer, or the least token of remembrance by Pipes, who\nwas suffered to depart with a general compliment from the mother, and\narrived at Winchester the next day.\n\nPeregrine's eyes sparkled when he saw his messenger come in, and he\nstretched out his hand in full confidence of receiving some particular\nmark of his Emilia's affection; but how was he confounded, when he found\nhis hope so cruelly disappointed! In an instant his countenance fell.\nHe stood for some time silent and abashed, then thrice repeated the\ninterrogation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! not one word from Emilia?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and dubious of his\ncourier's discretion, inquired minutely into all the particulars of his\nreception. He asked if he had seen the young lady, if she was in good\nhealth, if he had found an opportunity of delivering his letter, and how\nshe looked, when he put it into her hand? Pipes answered, that he had\nnever seen her in better health or better spirits; that he had managed\nmatters so as not only to present the billet unperceived, but also to\nask her commands in private before he took his leave, when she told him\nthat the letter required no reply. This last circumstance he considered\nas a manifest mark of disrespect, and gnawed his lips with resentment.\nUpon further reflection, however, he supposed that she could not\nconveniently write by the messenger, and would undoubtedly favour him by\nthe post. This consideration consoled him for the present, and he waited\nimpatiently for the fruits of his hope; but after he had seen eight\ndays elapse without reaping the satisfaction with which he had flattered\nhimself, his temper forsook him, he raved against the whole sex, and was\nseized with a fit of sullen chagrin; but his pride in a little time came\nto his assistance, and rescued him from the horrors of the melancholy\nfiend. He resolved to retort her own neglect upon her ungrateful\nmistress; his countenance gradually resumed its former serenity; and\nthough by this time he was pretty well cured of his foppery, he appeared\nagain at public diversions with an air of gaiety and unconcern, that\nEmilia might have a chance of hearing how much, in all likelihood, he\ndisregarded her disdain.\n\nThere are never wanting certain officious persons, who take pleasure in\npromoting intelligence of this sort. His behaviour soon reached the ears\nof Miss Gauntlet, and confirmed her in the opinion she had conceived\nfrom his letter; so that she fortified herself in her former sentiments,\nand bore his indifference with great philosophy, Thus a correspondence,\nwhich had commenced with all the tenderness and sincerity of love,\nand every promise of duration, was interrupted in its infancy by a\nmisunderstanding occasioned by the simplicity of Pipes, who never once\nreflected upon the consequences of his deceit.\n\nThough their mutual passion was by these means suppressed for the\npresent, it was not altogether extinguished, but glowed in secret,\nthough even to themselves unknown, until an occasion, which afterwards\noffered, blew up the latent flame, and love resumed his empire in\ntheir breasts. While they moved, as it were, without the sphere of each\nother's attraction, the commodore, hearing that Perry was in danger of\ninvolving himself in some pernicious engagement, resolved, by advice\nof Mr. Jolter and his friend the parish priest, to recall him from the\nplace where he had contracted such imprudent connections, and send him\nto the university, where his education might be completed, and his fancy\nweaned from all puerile amusements.\n\nThis plan had been proposed to his own father, who, as hath been already\nobserved, stood always neuter in everything that concerned his eldest\nson; and as for Mrs. Pickle, she had never heard his name mentioned\nsince his departure with any degree of temper or tranquility, except\nwhen her husband informed her that he was in a fair way of being ruined\nby this indiscreet amour. It was then she began to applaud her own\nforesight, which had discerned the mark of reprobation in that vicious\nboy, and launched out in comparison between him and Gammy, who, she\nobserved, was a child of uncommon parts and solidity, and, with the\nblessing of God, would be a comfort to his parents, and an ornament to\nthe family.\n\nShould I affirm that this favourite whom she commended so much, was in\nevery respect the reverse of what she described; that he was a boy of\nmean capacity, and, though remarkably distorted in his body, much more\ncrooked in his disposition; and that she had persuaded her husband to\nespouse her opinion, though it was contrary to common sense, as well as\nto his own perception;--I am afraid the reader will think I represent a\nmonster that never existed in nature, and be apt to condemn the economy\nof my invention: nevertheless, there is nothing more true than every\ncircumstance of what I have advanced; and I wish the picture, singular\nas it is, may not be thought to resemble more than one original.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\n\n\nPeregrine is summoned to attend his Uncle--Is more and more hated by his\nown Mother--Appeals to his Father, whose Condescension is defeated by\nthe Dominion of his Wife.\n\n\nBut, waiving these reflections, let us return to Peregrine, who received\na summons to attend his uncle, and in a few days arrived with Mr. Jolter\nand Pipes at the garrison, which he filled with joy and satisfaction.\nThe alteration, which, during his absence, had happened in his person,\nwas very favourable to his appearance, which, from that of a comely boy,\nwas converted into that of a most engaging youth. He was already taller\nthan a middle-sized man, his shape ascertained, his sinews well knit,\nhis mien greatly improved, and his whole figure as elegant and graceful\nas if it had been cast in the same mould with the Apollo of Belvedere.\n\nSuch an outside could not fail of prepossessing people in his favour.\nThe commodore, notwithstanding the advantageous reports he had heard,\nfound his expectation exceeded in the person of Peregrine, and signified\nhis approbation in the most sanguine terms. Mrs. Trunnion was struck\nwith his genteel address, and received him with uncommon marks of\ncomplacency and affection: he was caressed by all the people in the\nneighbourhood, who, while they admired his accomplishments, could\nnot help pitying his infatuated mother, for being deprived of that\nunutterable delight which any other parent would have enjoyed in the\ncontemplation of such an amiable son.\n\nDivers efforts were made by some well-disposed people to conquer, if\npossible, this monstrous prejudice; but their endeavours, instead of\ncuring, served only to inflame the distemper, and she never could be\nprevailed upon to indulge him with the least mark of maternal regard. On\nthe contrary, her original disgust degenerated into such inveteracy\nof hatred, that she left no stone unturned to alienate the commodore's\naffection for this her innocent child, and even practised the most\nmalicious defamation to accomplish her purpose. Every day, did she abuse\nher husband's ear with some forged instance of Peregrine's ingratitude\nto his uncle, well knowing that it would reach the commodore's knowledge\nat night.\n\nAccordingly Mr. Pickle used to tell him at the club, that his hopeful\nfavourite had ridiculed him in such a company, and aspersed his spouse\non another occasion; and thus retail the little scandalous issue of his\nown wife's invention. Luckily for Peregrine, the commodore paid no\ngreat regard to the authority of his informer, because he knew from what\nchannel the intelligence flowed; besides, the youth had a staunch friend\nin Mr. Hatchway, who never failed to vindicate him when he was thus\nunjustly accused, and always found argument enough to confute the\nassertions of his enemies. But, though Trunnion had been dubious of\nthe young gentleman's principles, and deaf to the remonstrances of the\nlieutenant, Perry was provided with a bulwark strong enough to defend\nhim from all such assaults. This was no other than his aunt, whose\nregard for him was perceived to increase in the same proportion as his\nown mother's diminished; and, indeed, the augmentation of the one was,\nin all probability, owing to the decrease of the other; for the\ntwo ladies, with great civility, performed all the duties of good\nneighbourhood, and hated each other most piously in their hearts.\n\nMrs. Pickle, having been disobliged at the splendour of her sister's\nnew equipage, had, ever since that time, in the course of her visiting,\nendeavoured to make people merry with satirical jokes on the poor lady's\ninfirmities; and Mrs. Trunnion seized the very first opportunity of\nmaking reprisals, by inveighing against her unnatural behaviour to her\nown child; so that Peregrine, as on the one hand he was abhorred, so\non the other was he caressed, in consequence of this contention; and I\nfirmly believe that the most effectual method of destroying his interest\nat the garrison, would have been the show of countenancing him at\nhis father's house; but, whether this conjecture be reasonable or\nchimerical, certain it is the experiment was never tried, and therefore\nMr. Peregrine ran no risk of being disgraced. The commodore, who\nassumed, and justly too, the whole merit of his education, was now as\nproud of the youth's improvements as if he had actually been his\nown offspring; and sometimes his affection rose to such a pitch of\nenthusiasm, that he verily believed him to be the issue of his own\nloins. Notwithstanding this favourable predicament in which our hero\nstood with his aunt and her husband, he could not help feeling the\ninjury he suffered from the caprice of his mother; and though the gaiety\nof his disposition hindered him from afflicting himself with reflections\nof any gloomy cast, he did not fail to foresee, that if any sudden\naccident should deprive him of the commodore, he would in all likelihood\nfind himself in a very disagreeable situation. Prompted by this\nconsideration, he one evening accompanied his uncle to the club, and\nwas introduced to his father, before that worthy gentleman had the least\ninkling of his arrival.\n\nMr. Gamaliel was never so disconcerted as at this reencounter. His own\ndisposition would not suffer him to do anything that might create\nthe least disturbance, or interrupt his enjoyment; so strongly was he\nimpressed with the terror of his wife, that he durst not yield to\nthe tranquility of his temper: and, as I have already observed, his\ninclination was perfectly neutral. Thus distracted between different\nmotives, when Perry was presented to him, he sat silent and absorbed,\nas if he did not or would not perceive the application; and when he was\nurged to declare himself by the youth, who pathetically begged to know\nhow he had incurred his displeasure, he answered, in a peevish strain,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, good now, child, what would you have me to do? your mother can't\nabide you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf my mother is so unkind, I will not call it unnatural,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Peregrine, the tears of indignation starting from his eyes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas\nto banish me from her presence and affection, without the least cause\nassigned; I hope you will not be so unjust as to espouse her barbarous\nprejudice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBefore Mr. Pickle had time to reply to his expostulation, for which\nhe was not at all prepared, the commodore interposed, and enforced his\nfavourite's remonstrance, by telling Mr. Gamaliel that he was ashamed to\nsee any man drive in such a miserable manner under his wife's petticoat.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs for my own part,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, raising his voice, and assuming a look of\nimportance and command, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbefore I would suffer myself to be steered\nall weathers by any woman in Christendom, d'ye see, I'd raise such\na hurricane about her ears, that--\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here he was interrupted by Mr.\nHatchway, who thrusting his head towards the door, in the attitude of\none that listens, cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAhey, there's your spouse come to pay us a\nvisit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trunnion's features that instant adopted a new disposition; fear\nand confusion took possession of his countenance; his voice, from a tone\nof vociferation, sank into a whisper of, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSure, you must be mistaken,\nJack;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and, in great perplexity, he wiped off his sweat which had\nstarted on his forehead at this false alarm. The lieutenant, having thus\npunished him for the rodomontade he had uttered, told him, with an arch\nsneer, that he was deceived with the sound of the outward door creaking\nupon its hinges, which he mistook for Mrs. Trunnion's voice, and desired\nhim to proceed with his admonitions to Mr. Pickle. It is not to be\ndenied that this arrogance was a little unseasonable to the commodore,\nwho was in all respects as effectually subdued to the dominion of his\nwife as the person whose submission he then ventured to condemn; with\nthis difference of disposition--, Trunnion's subjection was like that of\na bear, chequered with fits of surliness and rage; whereas Pickle\nbore the yoke like an ox, without repining. No wonder, then, that\nthis indolence, this sluggishness, this stagnation of temper rendered\nGamaliel incapable of withstanding the arguments and importunity of his\nfriends, to which he at length surrendered. He acquiesced in the justice\nof their observations: and, taking his son by the hand, promised to\nfavour him for the future with his love and fatherly protection.\n\nBut this laudable resolution did not last. Mrs. Pickle, still dubious\nof his constancy, and jealous of his communication with the commodore,\nnever failed to interrogate him every night about the conversation that\nhappened at the club, and to regulate her exhortations according to the\nintelligence she received. He was no sooner, therefore, conveyed to bed\n(that academy in which all notable wives communicate their lectures),\nwhen her catechism began; and she in a moment perceived something\nreluctant and equivocal in her husband's answers. Aroused at this\ndiscovery, she employed her influence and skill with such success, that\nhe disclosed every circumstance of what had happened; and after having\nsustained a most severe rebuke for his simplicity and indiscretion,\nhumbled himself so far as to promise that he would next day annul the\ncondescensions he had made, and for ever renounce the ungracious object\nof her disgust. This undertaking was punctually performed in a letter to\nthe commodore, which she herself dictated in these words:--\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir--Whereas my good-nature being last night imposed upon, I\n    was persuaded to countenance and promise I know not what to\n    that vicious youth, whose parent I have the misfortune to be;\n    I desire you will take notice that I will revoke all such\n    countenance and promises, and shall never look upon that man\n    as my friend who will, in such a cause, solicit,--\n    Sir, yours, etc.\n                            \u00e2\u0080\u009cGam. Pickle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n\n\nTrunnion is enraged at the conduct of Pickle--Peregrine resents the\nInjustice of his Mother, to whom he explains his Sentiments in a\nLetter-Is entered at the University of Oxford, where he signalizes\nhimself as a Youth of an enterprising Genius.\n\n\nUnspeakable were the transports of rage to which Trunnion was incensed\nby this absurd renunciation: he tore the letter with his gums (teeth\nhe had none), spit with furious grimaces, in token of the contempt\nhe entertain the for the author, whom he not only damned as a lousy,\nscabby, nasty, scurvy, skulking lubberly noodle, but resolved to\nchallenge to single combat with fire and sword; but, he was dissuaded\nfrom this violent measure, and appeased by the intervention and advice\nof the lieutenant and Mr. Jolter, who represented the message as the\neffect of the poor man's infirmity, for which he was rather an object\nof pity than of resentment, and turned the stream of his indignation\nagainst the wife, whom he reviled accordingly. Nor did Peregrine himself\nbear with patience this injurious declaration, the nature of which he no\nsooner understood from Hatchway than, equally shocked and exasperated,\nhe retired to his apartment, and, in the first emotions of his ire,\nproduced the following epistle, which was immediately conveyed to his\nmother,--\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,--Had nature formed me a bugbear to the sight, and\n    inspired me with a soul as vicious as my body was detestable,\n    perhaps I might have enjoyed particular marks of your affection\n    and applause; seeing you have persecuted me with such unnatural\n    aversion, for no other visible reason than that of my differing\n    so widely in shape as well as disposition from that deformed\n    urchin who is the object of your tenderness and care. If these be\n    the terms on which alone I can obtain your favour, I pray God\n    you may never cease to hate,--Madam, your much-injured son,\n                           \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeregrine Pickle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThis letter, which nothing, but his passion and inexperience could\nexcuse, had such an effect upon his mother as may be easily conceived.\nShe was enraged to a degree of frenzy against the writer; though, at the\nsame time, she considered the whole as the production of Mrs. Trunnion's\nparticular pique, and represented it to her husband as an insult that he\nwas bound in honour to resent, by breaking off all correspondence with\nthe commodore and his family. This was a bitter pill to Gamaliel, who,\nthrough a long course of years, was so habituated to Trunnion's company,\nthat he could as easily have parted with a limb as have relinquished the\nclub all at once. He therefore ventured to represent his own incapacity\nto follow her advice, and begged that he might, at least, be allowed to\ndrop the connection gradually, protesting that he would do his endeavour\nto give her all manner of satisfaction.\n\nMeanwhile preparations were made for Peregrine's departure to the\nuniversity, and in a few weeks he set out, in the seventeenth year\nof his age, accompanied by the same attendants who lived with him at\nWinchester. His uncle laid strong injunctions upon him to avoid the\ncompany of immodest women, to mind his learning, to let him hear of\nhis welfare as often as he could find time to write, and settled\nhis appointments at the rate of five hundred a year, including his\ngovernor's salary, which was one-fifth part of the sum. The heart of\nour young gentleman dilated at the prospect of the figure he should make\nwith such a handsome annuity the management of which was left to his\nown discretion; and he amused his imagination with the most agreeable\nreveries during his journey to Oxford, which he performed in two days.\nHere, being introduced to the head of the college, to whom he had been\nrecommended, accommodated with genteel apartments, entered as gentleman\ncommoner in the books, and provided with a judicious tutor, instead of\nreturning to the study of Greek and Latin, in which he thought himself\nalready sufficiently instructed, he renewed his acquaintance with some\nof his old school-fellows, whom he found in the same situation, and was\nby them initiated in all the fashionable diversions of the place.\n\nIt was not long before he made himself remarkable for his spirit and\nhumour, which were so acceptable to the bucks of the university, that he\nwas admitted as a member of their corporation, and in a very little time\nbecame the most conspicuous personage of the whole fraternity. Not that\nhe valued himself upon his ability in smoking the greatest number\nof pipes, and drinking the largest quantity of ale: these were\nqualifications of too gross a nature to captivate his refined ambition.\nHe piqued himself on his talent for raillery, his genius and taste,\nhis personal accomplishments, and his success at intrigue. Nor were his\nexcursions confined to the small villages in the neighbourhood, which\nare commonly visited once a week by the students for the sake of carnal\nrecreation. He kept his own horses, traversed the whole country in\nparties of pleasure, attended all the races within fifty miles of\nOxford, and made frequent jaunts to London, where he used to be\nincognito during the best part of many a term.\n\nThe rules of the university were too severe to be observed by a youth\nof his vivacity; and therefore he became acquainted with the proctor\nbetimes. But all the checks he received were insufficient to moderate\nhis career; he frequented taverns and coffee-houses, committed midnight\nfrolics in the streets, insulted all the sober and pacific class of\nhis fellow-students: the tutors themselves were not sacred from his\nridicule; he laughed at the magistrate, and neglected every particular\nof college discipline. In vain did they attempt to restrain his\nirregularities by the imposition of fines; he was liberal to profusion,\nand therefore paid without reluctance. Thrice did he scale the windows\nof a tradesman, with whose daughter he had an affair of gallantry; as\noften was he obliged to seek his safety by a precipitate leap; and one\nnight would, in all probability, have fallen a sacrifice to an ambuscade\nthat was laid by the father, had not his trusty squire Pipes interposed\nin his behalf, and manfully rescued him from the clubs of his enemies.\n\nIn the midst of these excesses, Mr. Jolter, finding his admonitions\nneglected and his influence utterly destroyed, attempted to wean his\npupil from his extravagant courses, by engaging his attention in some\nmore laudable pursuit. With this view he introduced him into a club\nof politicians, who received him with great demonstrations of regard,\naccommodated themselves more than he could have expected to his jovial\ndisposition, and while they revolved schemes for the reformation of the\nstate, drank with such devotion to the accomplishment of their\nplans, that, before parting, the cares of their patriotism were quite\noverwhelmed.\n\nPeregrine, though he could not approve of their doctrine, resolved to\nattach himself for some time to their company, because he perceived\nample subject for his ridicule in the characters of these wrong-headed\nenthusiasts. It was a constant practice with them, in their midnight\nconsistories, to swallow such plentiful draughts of inspiration, that\ntheir mysteries commonly ended like those of the Bacchanalian orgia; and\nthey were seldom capable of maintaining that solemnity of decorum which,\nby the nature of their functions, most of them were obliged to profess.\nNow, as Peregrine's satirical disposition was never more gratified than\nwhen he had an opportunity of exposing grave characters in ridiculous\nattitudes, he laid a mischievous snare for his new confederates, which\ntook effect in this manner:--In one of their nocturnal deliberations,\nhe promoted such a spirit of good fellowship by the agreeable sallies\nof his wit, which were purposely leveled against their political\nadversaries, that by ten o'clock they were all ready to join in the most\nextravagant proposal that could be made. They broke their glasses in\nconsequence of his suggestion, drank healths out of their shoes, caps,\nand the bottoms of the candlesticks that stood before them, sometimes\nstanding with one foot on a chair, and the knee bent on the edge of\nthe table; and when they could no longer stand in that posture, setting\ntheir bare posteriors on the cold floor. They huzzaed, hallooed, danced,\nand sang, and, in short, were elevated to such a pitch of intoxication,\nthat when Peregrine proposed that they should burn their periwigs, the\nhint was immediately approved, and they executed the frolic as one man.\nTheir shoes and caps underwent the same fate by the same instigation,\nand in this trim he led them forth into the street, where they resolved\nto compel everybody they should find to subscribe to their political\ncreed, and pronounce the Shibboleth of their party. In the achievement\nof this enterprise, they met with more opposition than they expected;\nthey were encountered with arguments which they could not well\nwithstand; the noses of some, and eyes of others, in a very little\ntime bore the marks of obstinate disputation. Their conductor having at\nlength engaged the whole body in a fray with another squadron which was\npretty much in the same condition, he very fairly gave them the slip,\nand slyly retreated to his apartment, foreseeing that his companions\nwould soon be favoured with the notice of their superiors: nor was he\ndeceived in his prognostic; the proctor, going his round, chanced to\nfall in with this tumultuous uproar, and, interposing his authority,\nfound means to quiet the disturbance. He took cognizance of their names,\nand dismissed the rioters to their respective chambers, not a little\nscandalized at the behaviour of some among them, whose business and\nduty it was to set far other examples for the youth under their care and\ndirection.\n\nAbout midnight, Pipes, who had orders to attend at a distance, and keep\nan eye upon Jolter, brought home that unfortunate governor upon his\nback, Peregrine having beforehand secured his admittance into the\ncollege; and among other bruises, he was found to have received a couple\nof contusions on his face, which next morning appeared in a black circle\nthat surrounded each eye.\n\nThis was a mortifying circumstance to a man of his character and\ndeportment, especially as he had received a message from the proctor,\nwho desired to see him forthwith. With great humility and contrition\nhe begged the advice of his pupil, who being used to amuse himself with\npainting, assured Mr. Jolter that he would cover those signs of disgrace\nwith a slight coat of flesh-colour so dexterously, that it would be\nalmost impossible to distinguish the artificial from the natural skin.\nThe rueful governor, rather than expose such opprobrious tokens to the\nobservation and censure of the magistrate, submitted to the expedient.\nAlthough his counsellor had overrated his own skill, he was persuaded to\nconfide in the disguise, and actually attended the proctor, with such\na staring addition to the natural ghastliness of his features, that\nhis visage bore a very apt resemblance to some of those ferocious\ncountenances that hang over the doors of certain taverns and ale-houses,\nunder the denomination of the Saracen's head.\n\nSuch a remarkable alteration of physiognomy could not escape the notice\nof the most undiscerning beholder, much less the penetrating eye of his\nsevere judge, already whetted with what he had seen over-night. He was\ntherefore upbraided with this ridiculous and shallow artifice, and,\ntogether with the companions of his debauch, underwent such a cutting\nreprimand for the scandalous irregularity of his conduct, that all of\nthem remained crest-fallen, and were ashamed, for many weeks, to appear\nin the public execution of their duty.\n\nPeregrine was too vain of his finesse, to conceal the part he acted in\nthis comedy, with the particulars of which he regaled his companions,\nand thereby entailed upon himself the hate and resentment of the\ncommunity whose maxims and practices he had disclosed: for he was\nconsidered as a spy, who had intruded himself into their society, with a\nview of betraying it; or, at best, as an apostate and renegado from the\nfaith and principles which he had professed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n\n\nHe is insulted by his Tutor, whom he lampoons--Makes a considerable\nProgress in Polite Literature; and, in an Excursion to Windsor, meets\nwith Emilia by accident, and is very coldly received.\n\n\nAmong those who suffered by his craft and infidelity was Mr. Jumble,\nhis own tutor, who could not at all digest the mortifying affront he had\nreceived, and was resolved to be revenged on the insulting author. With\nthis view he watched the conduct of Mr. Pickle with the utmost rancour\nof vigilance, and let slip no opportunity of treating him disrespect,\nwhich he knew the disposition of his pupil could less brook than any\nother severity it was in his power to exercise.\n\nPeregrine had been several mornings absent from chapel; and as Mr.\nJumble never failed to question him in a very peremptory style about his\nnon-attendance, he invented some very plausible excuses; but at length\nhis ingenuity was exhausted: he received a very galling rebuke for his\nproffigacy of morals; and, that he might feel it the more sensibly, was\nordered, by way of exercise, to compose a paraphrase in English verse\nupon these two lines in Virgil:--\n\n    Vane Ligur, frustraque animis elate superbis,\n    Nequicquam patrias tentasti lubricus artes.\n\n\nThe imposition of this invidious theme had all the desired effect upon\nPeregrine, who not only considered it as a piece of unmannerly abuse\nleveled against his own conduct, but also a retrospective insult on\nthe memory of his grandfather, who, as he had been informed, was in his\nlifetime more noted for his cunning than candour in trade.\n\nExasperated at this instance of the pedant's audacity, he had well nigh,\nin his first transports, taken corporal satisfaction on the spot;\nbut, foreseeing the troublesome consequences that would attend such\na flagrant outrage against the laws of the university, he checked his\nindignation, and resolved to revenge the injury in a more cool and\ncontemptuous manner. Thus determined, he set on foot an inquiry into\nthe particulars of Jumble's parentage and education. He learnt that the\nfather of this insolent tutor was a brick-layer, that his mother sold\npies, and that the son, in different periods of his youth, had amused\nhimself in both occupations, before he converted his views to the study\nof learning. Fraught with this intelligence, he composed the following\nballad in doggerel rhymes; and next day, presented it as a gloss upon\nthe text which the tutor had chosen:--\n\n    Come, listen, ye students of every degree;\n    I sing of a wit and a tutor perdie,\n    A statesman profound, a critic immense,\n    In short a mere jumble of learning and sense;\n    And yet of his talents though laudably vain,\n    His own family arts he could never attain.\n\n    His father, intending his fortune to build,\n    In his youth would have taught him the trowel to wield,\n    But the mortar of discipline never would stick,\n    For his skull was secured by a facing of brick;\n    And with all his endeavours of patience and pain,\n    The skill of his sire he could never attain.\n\n    His mother, a housewife neat, artful, and wise,\n    Renown'd for her delicate biscuit and pies,\n    soon alter'd his studies, by flattering his taste,\n    From the raising of walls to the rearing of paste!\n    But all her instructions were fruitless and vain;\n    The pie-making mystery he ne'er could attain.\n\n    Yet true to his race, in his labours were seen\n    A jumble of both their professions, I ween;\n    For, when his own genius he ventured to trust,\n    His pies seemed of brick, and his houses of crust.\n    Then good Mr. Tutor, pray be not so vain,\n    Since your family arts you could never attain.\n\n\nThis impudent production was the most effectual vengeance he could\nhave taken on his tutor, who had all the supercilious arrogance and\nridiculous pride of a low-born pedant. Instead of overlooking this\npetulant piece of satire with that temper and decency of disdain that\nbecame a person of his gravity and station, he no sooner cast his eye\nover the performance, than the blood rushed into his countenance, and\nimmediately after exhibited a ghastly pale colour. With a quivering lip,\nhe told his pupil, that he was an impertinent jackanapes; and he would\ntake care that he should be expelled from the university, for having\npresumed to write and deliver such a licentious and scurrilous libel.\nPeregrine answered, with great resolution, that when the provocation\nhe had received should be known, he was persuaded that he should be\nacquitted by the opinion of all impartial people; and that he was ready\nto submit the whole to the decision of the master.\n\nThis arbitration he proposed, because he knew the master and Jumble were\nat variance; and, for that reason, the tutor durst not venture to put\nthe cause on such an issue. Nay, when this reference was mentioned,\nJumble, who was naturally jealous, suspected that Peregrine had a\npromise of protection before he undertook to commit such an outrageous\ninsult; and this notion had such an effect upon him, that he decided\nto devour his vexation, and wait for a more proper opportunity of\ngratifying his hate. Meanwhile, copies of the ballad were distributed\namong the students, who sang it under the very nose of Mr. Jumble, to\nthe tune of \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Cobbler there was\u00e2\u0080\u009d etc.; and the triumph of our hero\nwas complete. Neither was his whole time devoted to the riotous\nextravagancies of youth. He enjoyed many lucid intervals, during which\nhe contracted a more intimate acquaintance with the classics, applied\nhimself to the reading of history, improved his taste for painting and\nmusic, in which he made some progress; and, above all things, cultivated\nthe study of natural philosophy. It was generally after a course of\nclose attention to some of these arts and sciences, that his disposition\nbroke out into those irregularities and wild sallies of a luxuriant\nimagination, for which he became so remarkable; and he was perhaps the\nonly young man in Oxford who, at the same time, maintained an intimate\nand friendly intercourse with the most unthinking, as well as the most\nsedate students at the university.\n\nIt is not to be supposed that a young man of Peregrine's vanity,\ninexperience, and profusion, could suit his expense to his allowance,\nliberal as it was--for he was not one of those fortunate people who are\nborn economists, and knew not the art of withholding his purse when he\nsaw his companion in difficulty. Thus naturally generous and expensive,\nhe squandered away his money, and made a most splendid appearance upon\nthe receipt of his quarterly appointment; but long before the third\nmonth was elapsed, his finances were consumed: and as he could not stoop\nto ask an extraordinary supply, was too proud to borrow, and too haughty\nto run in debt with tradesmen, he devoted those periods of poverty to\nthe prosecution of his studies, and shone forth again at the revolution\nof quarter-day.\n\nIn one of these eruptions he and some of his companions went to Windsor,\nin order to see the royal apartments in the castle, whither they\nrepaired in the afternoon; and as Peregrine stood contemplating the\npicture of Hercules and Omphale, one of his fellow-students whispered in\nhis car, \u00e2\u0080\u009cZounds! Pickle, there are two fine girls!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He turned instantly\nabout, and in one of them recognized his almost forgotten Emilia; her\nappearance acted upon his imagination like a spark of fire that falls\namong gun-powder; that passion which had lain dormant for the space of\ntwo years, flashed up in a moment, and he was seized with a trepidation.\nShe perceived and partook of his emotion; for their souls, like unisons,\nvibrated with the same impulse. However, she called her pride and\nresentment to her aid, and found resolution enough to retire from such a\ndangerous scene.\n\nAlarmed at her retreat, he recollected all his assurance, and, impelled\nby love, which he could no longer resist, followed her into the next\nroom, where, in the most disconcerted manner, he accosted her with \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour\nhumble servant, Miss Gauntlet;\u00e2\u0080\u009d to which salutation she replied, with\nan affectation of indifference, that did not, however, conceal her\nagitation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour servant, sir;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and immediately extending her finger\ntoward the picture of Duns Scotus, which is fixed over one of the doors,\nasked her companion, in a giggling tone, if she did not think he looked\nlike a conjurer? Peregrine, nettled into spirits by this reception,\nanswered for the other lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat it was an easy matter to be a\nconjurer in those times, when the simplicity of the age assisted his\ndivination; but were he, or Merlin himself, to rise from the dead now,\nwhen such deceit and dissimulation prevail, they would not be able to\nearn their bread by the profession.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cO! Sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, turning\nfull upon him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwithout doubt they would adopt new maxims; 'tis\nno disparagement in this enlightened age for one to alter one's\nopinion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, sure, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the youth, with some\nprecipitation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cprovided the change be for the better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd should\nit happen otherwise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d retorted the nymph, with a flirt of her\nfan, \u00e2\u0080\u009cinconstancy will never want countenance from the practice of\nmankind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed our hero, fixing his eyes upon her;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cexamples of levity are every where to be met with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh Lord, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n cried Emilia, tossing her head, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou'll scarce ever find a fop without\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBy this time his companion, seeing him engaged with one of the ladies,\nentered into conversation with the other; and, in order to favour his\nfriend's gallantry, conducted her into the next apartment, on pretence\nof entertaining her with the sight of a remarkable piece of painting.\n\nPeregrine, laying hold on this opportunity of being alone with the\nobject of his love, assumed a most seducing tenderness of look, and,\nheaving a profound sigh, asked if she had utterly discarded him from\nher remembrance. Reddening at this pathetic question, which recalled the\nmemory of the imagined slight he had put upon her, she answered in great\nconfusion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir, I believe I once had the pleasure of seeing you at a\nball in Winchester.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Emilia,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, very gravely, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill you\nbe so candid as to tell me what misbehaviour of mine you are pleased to\npunish, by restricting your remembrance to that single occasion?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr.\nPickle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied, in the same tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is neither my province\nnor inclination to judge your conduct; and therefore you misapply your\nquestion when you ask such an explanation of me\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt least\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed our\nlover, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgive me the melancholy satisfaction to know for what offence\nof mine you refused to take least notice of that letter which I had the\nhonour to write from Winchester by your own express permission.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour\nletter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said miss, with great vivacity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cneither required, nor, in my\nopinion, deserved an answer; and to be free with you, Mr. Pickle, it\nwas but a shallow artifice to rid yourself of a correspondence you had\ndeigned to solicit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPeregrine, confounded at this repartee, replied that howsoever he might\nhave failed in point of elegance or discretion, he was sure he had not\nbeen deficient in expressions of respect and devotion for those charms\nwhich it was his pride to adore: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs for the verses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI own\nthey were unworthy of the theme; but I flattered myself that they would\nhave merited your acceptance, though not your approbation, and been\nconsidered not so much as the proof of my genius, as the genuine\neffusion of my love.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cVerses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Emilia with an air of\nastonishment, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat verses? I really don't understand you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young gentleman was thunderstruck at this exclamation; to which,\nafter a long pause, he answered: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI begin to suspect, and heartily wish\nit may appear, that we have misunderstood each other from the beginning.\nPray, Miss Gauntlet, did you not find a copy of verses inclosed in that\nunfortunate letter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cTruly, sit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not so much of\na connoisseur as to distinguish whether that facetious production, which\nyou merrily style as an unfortunate letter, was composed in verse or\nprose; but methinks, the jest is a little too stale to be brought upon\nthe carpet again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, she tripped away to her companion, and\nleft her lover in a most tumultuous suspense. He now perceived that her\nneglect of his addresses when he was at Winchester, must have been owing\nto some mystery which he could not comprehend; and she began to suspect\nand to hope that the letter which she received was spurious, though\nshe could not conceive how that could possibly happen, as it had been\ndelivered to her by the hands of his own servant.\n\nHowever, she resolved to leave the task of unravelling this affair to\nhim, who, she knew, would infallibly exert himself for his own as well\nas her satisfaction. She was not deceived in her opinion: he went up\nto her again at the staircase, and, as they were improvided with a male\nattendant, insisted upon squiring the ladies to their lodgings. Emilia\nsaw his drift, which was no other than to know where she lived; and\nthough she approved of his contrivance, thought it was incumbent upon\nher, for the support of her own dignity, to decline the chivalry;\nshe therefore thanked him for his polite offer, but would by no means\nconsent to his giving himself such unnecessary trouble, especially as\nthey had a very little way to walk. He was not repulsed by this refusal,\nthe nature of which he perfectly understood; nor was she sorry to see\nhim persevere in his determination: he therefore accompanied them\nin their return, and made divers efforts to speak with Emilia in\nparticular; but she had a spice of the coquette in her disposition,\nand being determined to whet his impatience, artfully baffled all\nhis endeavours, by keeping her companion continually engaged in the\nconversation, which turned upon the venerable appearance and imperial\nsituation of the place. Thus tantalized, he lounged with them to the\ndoor of the house in which they lodged, when his mistress, perceiving,\nby the countenance of her comrade, that she was on the point of desiring\nhim to walk in, checked her intention with a frown; then, turning to Mr.\nPickle, dropped him a very formal curtsy, seized the other young lady by\nthe arm, and saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, cousin Sophy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d vanished in a moment.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n\n\nAfter sundry unsuccessful Efforts, he finds means to come to an\nExplanation with his Mistress; and a Reconciliation ensues.\n\n\nPeregrine, disconcerted at their sudden disappearance, stood for some\nminutes gaping in the street, before he could get the better of his\nsurprise; and then deliberated with himself whether he should demand\nimmediate admittance to his mistress, or choose some other method of\napplication. Piqued at her abrupt behaviour, though pleased with her\nspirit, he set his invention to work, in order to contrive some means\nof seeing her: and in a fit of musing arrived at the inn, where he found\nhis companions, whom he had left at the castle-gate. They had already\nmade inquiry about the ladies; in consequence of which he learnt that\nMiss Sophy was daughter of a gentleman in town to which his mistress\nwas related; that an intimate friendship subsisted between the two\nyoung ladies; that Emilia had lived almost a month with her cousin, and\nappeared at the last assembly, where she was universally admired: and\nthat several young gentlemen of fortune had since that time teased her\nwith addresses.\n\nOur hero's ambition was flattered, and his passion inflamed with this\nintelligence; and he swore within himself that he would not quit the\nspot until he should have obtained an undisputed victory over all his\nrivals.\n\nThat same evening he composed a most eloquent epistle, in which he\nearnestly entreated that she would favour him with an opportunity of\nvindicating his conduct: but she would neither receive his billet, nor\nsee his messenger. Balked in this effort, he inclosed it in a new cover\ndirected by another hand, and ordered Pipes to ride next morning to\nLondon, on purpose to deliver it at the post-office; that coming by such\nconveyance she might have no suspicion of the author, and open it before\nshe should be aware of the deceit.\n\nThree days he waited patiently for the effect of this stratagem, and,\nin the afternoon of the fourth, ventured to hazard a formal visit, in\nquality of an old acquaintance. But here too he failed in his attempt:\nshe was indisposed, and could not see company. These obstacles\nserved only to increase his eagerness: he still adhered to his former\nresolution; and his companions, understanding his determination, left\nhim next day to his own inventions. Thus relinquished to his own ideas,\nhe doubled his assiduity, and practised every method his imagination\ncould suggest, in order to promote his plan.\n\nPipes was stationed all day long within sight of her door, that he might\nbe able to give his master an account of her motions; but she never\nwent abroad except to visit in the neighbourhood, and was always housed\nbefore Peregrine could be apprised of her appearance. He went to church\nwith a view of attracting her notice, and humbled his deportment before\nher; but she was so mischievously devout as to look at nothing but\nher book, so that he was not favoured with one glance of regard. He\nfrequented the coffee-house, and attempted to contract an acquaintance\nwith Miss Sophy's father, who, he hoped, would invite him to his house:\nbut this expectation was also defeated. That prudent gentleman looked\nupon him as one of those forward fortune-hunters who go about the\ncountry seeking whom they may devour, and warily discouraged all his\nadvances. Chagrined by so many unsuccessful endeavours, he began to\ndespair of accomplishing his aim; and, as the last suggestion of his\nart, paid off his lodging, took horse at noon, and departed, in all\nappearance, for the place from whence he had come. He rode, but a few\nmiles, and in the dusk of the evening returned unseen, alighted at\nanother inn, ordered Pipes to stay within doors, and keeping himself\nincognito, employed another person as a sentinel upon Emilia.\n\nIt was not long before he reaped the fruits of his ingenuity. Next day\nin the afternoon he was informed by his spy that the two young ladies\nwere gone to walk in the park, whither he followed them on the instant,\nfully determined to come to an explanation with his mistress, even in\npresence of her friend, who might possibly be prevailed upon to interest\nherself in his behalf.\n\nWhen he saw them at such a distance that they could not return to\ntown before he should have an opportunity of putting his resolution in\npractice, he mended his pace, and found means to appear before them\nso suddenly, that Emilia could not help expressing her surprise in a\nscream. Our lover, putting on a mien of humility and mortification,\nbegged to know if her resentment was implacable; and asked why she had\nso cruelly refused to grant him the common privilege that every\ncriminal enjoyed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDear Miss Sophy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, addressing himself to her\ncompanion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgive me leave to implore your intercession with your cousin.\nI am sure you have humanity enough to espouse my cause, did you but know\nthe justice of it; and I flatter myself that by your kind interposition\nI may be able to rectify that fatal misunderstanding which hath made\nme wretched.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sophy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou appear like a gentleman, and\nI doubt not but your behaviour has been always suitable to your\nappearance; but you must excuse me from undertaking any such office\nin behalf of a person whom I have not the honour to know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered Peregrine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope Miss Emy will justify my pretensions to that\ncharacter, notwithstanding the mystery of her displeasure, which, upon\nmy honour, I cannot for my soul explain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord! Mr. Pickle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nEmilia, who had by this time recollected herself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never questioned\nyour gallantry and taste; but I am resolved that you shall never have\ncause to exercise your talents at my expense; so that you tease yourself\nand me to no purpose. Come, Sophy, let us walk home again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood God!\nmadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the lover, with great emotion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy will you distract me\nwith such barbarous indifference? Stay, dear Emilia!--I conjure you on\nmy knees to stay and hear me. By all that is sacred, I was not to blame.\nYou must have been imposed upon by some villain who envied my good\nfortune, and took some treacherous method to ruin my love.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMiss Sophy, who possessed a large stock of good nature, and to whom\nher cousin had communicated the cause of her reserve, seeing the young\ngentleman so much affected with that disdain which she knew to be\nfeigned, laid hold on Emilia's sleeve, saying, with a smile, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot quite\nso fast, Emily. I begin to perceive that this is a love-quarrel, and\ntherefore there may be hopes of a reconciliation; for I suppose both\nparties are open to conviction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor my own part,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Peregrine,\nwith great eagerness, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI appeal to Miss Sophy's decision. But why do I\nsay appeal? Though I am conscious of having committed no offence, I am\nready to submit to any penance, let it be never so rigorous, that my\nfair enslaver herself shall impose, provided it will entitle me to\nher favour and forgiveness at last.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Emily, well nigh overcome by this\ndeclaration, told him, that as she taxed him with no guilt, she expected\nno atonement, and pressed her companion to return to town. But Sophy,\nwho was too indulgent to her friend's real inclination to comply with\nher request, observed that the gentleman seemed so reasonable in his\nconcessions, that she began to think her cousin was in the wrong, and\nfelt herself disposed to act as umpire in the dispute.\n\nOverjoyed at this condescension, Mr. Pickle thanked her in the most\nrapturous terms, and, in the transport of his expectation, kissed the\nhand of his kind mediatrix--a circumstance which had a remarkable effect\non the countenance of Emilia, who did not seem to relish the warmth of\nhis acknowledgment.\n\nAfter many supplications on one hand, and pressing remonstrances on the\nother, she yielded at length, and, turning to her lover while her face\nwas overspread with blushes,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009csupposing I were\nto put the difference on that issue, how could you excuse the ridiculous\nletter which you sent to me from Winchester?\u00e2\u0080\u009d This expostulation\nintroduced a discussion of the whole affair, in which all the\ncircumstances were canvassed; and Emilia still affirmed, with great\nheat, that the letter must have been calculated to affront her; for she\ncould not suppose the author was so weak as to design it for any other\npurpose.\n\nPeregrine, who still retained in his memory the substance of this\nunlucky epistle, as well as the verses which were inclosed, could\nrecollect no particular expression which could have justly given the\nleast umbrage; and therefore, in the agonies of perplexity, begged\nthat the whole might be submitted to the judgment of Miss Sophy, and\nfaithfully promised to stand to her award. In short, this proposal was,\nwith seeming reluctance, embraced by Emilia, and an appointment made to\nmeet next day in the place, whither both parties were desired to come\nprovided with their credentials, according to which definitive sentence\nwould be pronounced.\n\nOur lover, having succeeded thus far, overwhelmed Sophy with\nacknowledgments on account of her generous mediation; and in the course\nof their walk, which Emilia was now in no hurry to conclude, whispered\na great many tender protestations in the ear of his mistress, who\nnevertheless continued to act upon the reserve, until her doubts should\nbe more fully resolved.\n\nMr. Pickle, having found means to amuse them in the fields till the\ntwilight, was obliged to wish them good even, after having obtained a\nsolemn repetition of their promise to meet him at the appointed time\nand place, and then retreated to his apartment, where he spent the whole\nnight in various conjectures on the subject of the letter, the Gordian\nknot of which he could by no means untie. One while he imagined that\nsome wag had played a trick on his messenger, in consequence of\nwhich Emilia had received a supposititious letter; but, upon farther\nreflection, he could not conceive the practicability of any such deceit.\nThen he began to doubt the sincerity of his mistress, who perhaps had\nonly made that a handle for discarding him, at the request of some\nfavoured rival; but his own integrity forbade him to harbour this mean\nsuspicion; and therefore he was again involved in the labyrinth of\nperplexity. Next day he waited on the rack of impatience for the hour of\nfive in the afternoon, which no sooner struck than he ordered Pipes\nto attend him, in case there should be occasion for his evidence, and\nrepaired to the place of rendezvous, where he had not tarried five\nminutes before the ladies appeared. Mutual compliments being passed, and\nthe attendant stationed at a convenient distance, Peregrine persuaded\nthem to sit down upon the grass, under the shade of a spreading oak,\nthat they might be more at their ease; while he stretched himself at\ntheir feet, and desired that the paper on which his doom depended might\nbe examined. It was accordingly put into the hand of his fair arbitress,\nwho read it immediately with an audible voice. The first two words of\nit were no sooner pronounced, than he started, with great emotion, and\nraised himself upon his hand and knee, in which posture he listened\nto the rest of the sentence; then sprang upon his feet in the utmost\nastonishment, and, glowing with resentment at the same time, exclaimed,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHell and the devil! what's all that? Sure you make a jest of me,\nmadam!\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cPray, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sophy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgive me the hearing for a few\nmoments, and then urge what you shall think proper in your own defence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Having thus cautioned him, she proceeded; but before she had finished\none-half of the performance, her gravity forsook her, and she was seized\nwith a violent fit of laughter, in which neither of the lovers could\nhelp joining, notwithstanding the resentment which at that instant\nprevailed in the breasts of both. The judge, however, in a little\ntime, resumed her solemnity, and having read the remaining part of this\ncurious epistle, all three continued staring at each other alternately\nfor the space of half a minute, and then broke forth at the same instant\nin another paroxysm of mirth. From this unanimous convulsion, one would\nhave thought that both parties were extremely well pleased with a joke,\nyet this was by no means the case.\n\nEmilia imagined that, notwithstanding his affected surprise, her lover,\nin spite of himself, had received the laugh at her expense, and in so\ndoing applauded his own unmannerly ridicule. This supposition could not\nfail of raising and reviving her indignation, while Peregrine highly\nresented the indignity, with which he supposed himself treated, in their\nattempting to make him the dupe of such a gross and ludicrous artifice.\nThis being the situation of their thoughts, their mirth was succeeded by\na mutual gloominess of aspect; and the judge, addressing herself to Mr.\nPickle, asked if he had anything to offer why sentence should not be\npronounced? \u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the culprit, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sorry to find myself\nso low in the opinion of your cousin as to be thought capable of being\ndeceived by such shallow contrivance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Emilia, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe\ncontrivance is your own; and I cannot help admiring your confidence in\nimputing it to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon my honour, Miss Emily, resumed our hero, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\nwrong my understanding, as well as my love, in accusing me of having\nwritten such a silly, impertinent performance. The very appearance and\naddress of it is so unlike the letter which I did myself the honour\nto write, that I dare say my man, even at this distance of time, will\nremember the difference.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he extended his voice, and beckoned to Pipes, who immediately\ndrew near. His mistress seemed to object to the evidence, by observing\nthat to be sure Mr. Pipes had his cue; when Peregrine, begging she would\nspare him the mortification of considering him in such a dishonourable\nlight, desired his valet to examine the outside of the letter, and\nrecollect if it was the same which he had delivered to Miss Gauntlet\nabout two years ago. Pipes, having taken a superficial view of it,\npulled up his breeches, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMayhap it is, but we have made so many\ntrips, and been in so many creeks and corners since that time, that I\ncan't pretend to be certain; for I neither keep journal nor log-book of\nour proceedings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Emilia commended him for his candour, at the same\ntime darting a sarcastic look at his master, as if she thought he had\ntampered with his servant's integrity in vain; and Peregrine began to\nlive and curse his fate for having subjected him to such mean suspicion,\nattesting heaven and earth in the most earnest manner, that far from\nhaving composed and conveyed that stupid production, he had never seen\nit before, nor been privy to the least circumstance of the plan.\n\nPipes, now, for the first time, perceived the mischief which he had\noccasioned; and, moved with the transports of his master, for whom he\nhad a most inviolable attachment, frankly declared he was ready to make\noath that Mr. Pickle had no hand in the letter which he delivered. All\nthree were amazed at this confession, the meaning of which they could\nnot comprehend. Peregrine, after some pause, leaped upon Pipes, and\nseizing him by the throat, exclaimed, in an ecstasy of rage. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRascal!\ntell me this instant what became of the letter I entrusted to your\ncare.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The patient valet, half-strangled as he was, squirted a\ncollection of tobacco-juice out of one corner of his mouth, and with\ngreat deliberation replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, burnt it, you wouldn't have me to give\nthe young woman a thing that shook all in the wind in tatters, would\nyou?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The ladies interposed in behalf of the distressed squire, from\nwhom, by dint of questions which he had neither art nor inclination to\nevade, they extorted an explanation of the whole affair.\n\nSuch ridiculous simplicity and innocence of intention appeared in the\ncomposition of his expedient, that even the remembrance of all the\nchagrin which it had produced, could not rouse their indignation, or\nenable the to resist a third eruption of laughter which they forthwith\nunderwent. Pipes was dismissed, with many menacing injunctions to beware\nof such conduct for the future; Emilia stood with a confusion of joy and\ntenderness in her countenance; Peregrine's eyes kindled into rapture,\nand, when Miss Sophy pronounced the sentence of reconciliation, advanced\nto his mistress, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTruth is mighty, and will prevail;\u00e2\u0080\u009d then\nclapping her in his arms, very impudently ravished a kiss, which she had\nnot power to refuse. Nay, such was the impulse of his joy, that he took\nthe same freedom with the lips of Sophy, calling her his kind mediatrix\nand guardian angel; and behaved with such extravagance of transport, as\nplainly evinced the fervour and sincerity of his love.\n\nI shall not pretend to repeat the tender protestations that were uttered\non one side, or describe the bewitching glances of approbation with\nwhich they were received on the other, suffice it to say that the\nendearing intimacy of their former connection was instantly renewed, and\nSophy, who congratulated them on the happy termination of their quarrel,\nfavoured with their mutual confidence. In consequence of this happy\npacification, they deliberated upon the means of seeing each other\noften; and as he could not, without some previous introduction, visit\nher openly at the house of her relation, they agreed to meet every\nafternoon in the park till the next assembly, at which he would solicit\nher as a partner, and she be unengaged, in expectation of his request.\nBy this connection he would be entitled to visit her next day, and\nthus an avowed correspondence would of course commence. This plan was\nactually put in execution, and attended with a circumstance which had\nwell-nigh produced some mischievous consequence, had not Peregrine's\ngood fortune been superior to his discretion.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n\n\nHe achieves an Adventure at the Assembly, and quarrels with his\nGovernor.\n\n\nAt the assembly, were no fewer than three gentlemen of fortune, who\nrivalled our lover in his passion for Emilia, and who had severally\nbegged the honour of dancing with her upon this occasion. She had\nexcused herself to each, on pretence of a slight indisposition that she\nforesaw would detain her from the ball, and desired they would provide\nthemselves with other partners. Obliged to admit her excuse, they\naccordingly followed her advice; and after they had engaged themselves\nbeyond the power of retracting, had the mortification of seeing her\nthere unclaimed. They in their turn made up to her, and expressed their\nsurprise and concern at finding her in the assembly unprovided, after\nshe had declined their invitation; but she told them that her cold had\nforsaken her since she had the pleasure of seeing them, and that she\nwould rely upon accident for a partner. Just as she pronounced these\nwords to the last of the three, Peregrine advanced as an utter stranger,\nbowed with great respect, told her he understood she was unengaged, and\nwould think himself highly honoured in being accepted as her partner for\nthe night; and he had the good fortune to succeed in his application.\n\nAs they were by far the handsomest and best-accomplished couple in the\nroom, they could not fail of attracting the notice and admiration of the\nspectators, which inflamed the jealousy of his three competitors, who\nimmediately entered into a conspiracy against this gaudy stranger, whom,\nas their rival, they resolved to affront in public. Pursuant to the plan\nwhich they projected for this purpose, the first country-dance was no\nsooner concluded, than one of them, with his partner, took place of\nPeregrine and his mistress, contrary to the regulation of the ball. Our\nlover, imputing his behaviour to inadvertency, informed the gentleman of\nhis mistake, and civilly desired he would rectify his error. The other\ntold him, in an imperious tone, that he wanted none of his advice, and\nbade him mind his own affairs. Peregrine answered, with some warmth, and\ninsisted upon his right: a dispute commenced, high words, ensued, in the\ncourse of which, our impetuous youth hearing himself reviled with the\nappellation of scoundrel, pulled off his antagonist's periwig, and\nflung it in his face. The ladies immediately shrieked, the gentlemen\ninterposed, Emilia was seized with a fit of trembling, and conducted\nto her seat by her youthful admirer, who begged pardon for having\ndiscomposed her, and vindicated what he had done, by representing the\nnecessity he was under to resent the provocation he had received.\n\nThough she could not help owning the justice of his plea, she not the\nless concerned at the dangerous situation in which he had involved\nhimself, and, in the utmost consternation and anxiety, insisted upon\ngoing directly home: he could not resist her importunities; and her\ncousin being determined to accompany her, he escorted to their lodgings,\nwhere he wished them good night, after having, in order to quiet their\napprehensions, protested, that if his opponent was satisfied, he should\nnever take any step towards the prosecution of the quarrel. Meanwhile\nthe assembly-room became a of scene of tumult and uproar: the person who\nconceived himself injured, seeing Peregrine retire, struggled with his\ncompanions, in order to pursue and take satisfaction of our hero, whom\nhe loaded with terms of abuse, and challenged to single combat. The\ndirector of the ball held a consultation with all the subscribers who\nwere present; and it was determined, by a majority of votes, that the\ntwo gentlemen who had occasioned the disturbance should be desired to\nwithdraw. This resolution being signified to one of the parties then\npresent, he made some difficulty of complying, but was persuaded to\nsubmit by his two confederates, who accompanied him to the street-door,\nwhere he was met by Peregrine on his return to the assembly.\n\nThis choleric gentleman, who was a country squire, no sooner saw his\nrival, than he began to brandish his cudgel in a menacing posture, when\nour adventurous youth, stepping back with one foot, laid his hand upon\nthe hilt of his sword, which he drew half way out of the scabbard. This\nattitude, and the sight of the blade which glistened by moonlight in his\nface, checked, in some sort, the ardour of his assailant, who desired\nhe would lay aside his toaster, and take a bout with him at equal arms.\nPeregrine, who was an expert cudgel-player, accepted the invitation:\nthen, exchanging weapons with Pipes, who stood behind him, put himself\nin a posture of defence, and received the attack of his adversary, who\nstruck at random, without either skill or economy. Pickle could have\nbeaten the cudgel out of his hand at the first blow; but as in that\ncase he would have been obliged in honour to give immediate quarter, he\nresolved to discipline his antagonist without endeavouring to disable\nhim, until he should be heartily satisfied with the vengeance he had\ntaken. With this view be returned the salute, and raised such a clatter\nabout the squire's pate, that one who had heard without seeing the\napplication, would have taken the sound for that of a salt-box, in the\nhand of a dexterous merry-andrew, belonging to one of the booths at\nBartholomew-fair. Neither was this salutation confined to his head: his\nshoulders, arms, thighs, ankles, and ribs, were visited with amazing\nrapidity, while Tom Pipes sounded the charge through his fist.\nPeregrine, tired with his exercise, which had almost bereft his enemy of\nsensation, at last struck the decisive blow, in consequence of which the\nsquire's weapon flew out of his grasp, and he allowed our hero to be\nthe better man. Satisfied with this acknowledgment, the victor walked\nupstairs with such elevation of spirits and insolence of mien, that\nnobody chose to intimate the resolution, which had been taken in his\nabsence; there, having amused himself for some time in beholding the\ncountry-dances, he retreated to his lodging, where he indulged himself\nall night in the contemplation of his own success.\n\nNext day in the forenoon he went to visit his partner; and the\ngentleman, at whose house she lived, having been informed of his family\nand condition, received him with great courtesy, as the acquaintance of\nhis cousin Gauntlet, and invited him to dinner that same day. Emilia was\nremarkably well pleased, when she understood the issue of his adventure,\nwhich began to make some noise in town even though it deprived her of\na wealthy admirer. The squire, having consulted an attorney about the\nnature of the dispute, in hopes of being able to prosecute Peregrine\nfor an assault, found little encouragement to go to law: he therefore\nresolved to pocket the insult and injury he had undergone, and to\ndiscontinue his addresses to her who was the cause of both.\n\nOur lover being told by his mistress that she proposed to stay a\nfortnight longer in Windsor, he determined to enjoy her company all that\ntime, and then to give her a convoy to the house of her mother, whom he\nlonged to see. In consequence of this plan, he every day contrived some\nfresh party of pleasure for the ladies, to whom he had by this time free\naccess; and entangled himself so much in the snares of love, that he\nseemed quite enchanted by Emilia's charms, which were now indeed almost\nirresistible. While he thus heedlessly roved in the flowery paths of\npleasure, his governor at Oxford alarmed at the unusual duration of\nhis absence, went to the young gentlemen who had accompanied him in his\nexcursion, and very earnestly entreated them to tell him, what they\nknew concerning his pupil: they accordingly gave him an account of the\nreencounter that happened between Peregrine and Miss Emily Gauntlet in\nthe castle, and mentioned circumstances sufficient to convince him that\nhis charge was very dangerously engaged.\n\nFar from having an authority over Peregrine, Mr. Jolter durst not even\ndisoblige him: therefore, instead of writing to the commodore, he took\nhorse immediately, and that same night reached Windsor, where he found\nhis stray sheep very much surprised at his unexpected arrival. The\ngovernor desiring to have some serious conversation with him, they\nshut themselves up in an apartment, when Jolter, with great solemnity,\ncommunicated the cause of his journey, which was no other than his\nconcern for his pupil's welfare; and very gravely undertook to prove,\nby mathematical demonstration, that this intrigue, if further pursued,\nwould tend to the young gentleman's ruin and disgrace. This singular\nproposition raised the curiosity of Peregrine, who promised to yield all\nmanner of attention, and desired him to begin without further preamble.\n\nThe governor, encouraged by this appearance of candour, expressed his\nsatisfaction in finding him so open to conviction, and told him he would\nproceed upon geometrical principles; then, hemming thrice, observed that\nno mathematical inquiries could be carried on, except upon certain data,\nor concessions of truth that were self-evident; and therefore he must\nhave his assent to a few axioms, which he was sure Mr. Pickle would see\nno reason to dispute. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the first place, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou will\ngrant, I hope, that youth and discretion are with respect to each other\nas two parallel lines, which, though infinitely produced, remain still\nequidistant, and will never coincide: then you must allow that passion\nacts upon the human mind in a ratio compounded of the acuteness of\nsense, and constitutional heat; and, thirdly, you will not deny that\nthe angle of remorse is equal to that of precipitation. These postulata\nbeing admitted,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added he, taking pen, ink, and paper, and drawing a\nparallelogram, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet youth be represented by the right line, a b, and\ndiscretion by another right line, c d, parallel to the former. Complete\nthe parallelogram, a b c d, and let the point of intersection, b,\nrepresent perdition. Let passion, represented under the letter c, have\na motion in the direction c a. At the same time, let another motion\nbe communicated to it, in the direction c d, it will proceed in the\ndiagonal c b, and describe it in the same time that it would have\ndescribed the side c a, by the first motion, or the side, c d, by the\nsecond. To understand the demonstration of this corollary, we must\npremise this obvious principle, that when a body is acted upon by a\nmotion of power parallel to a right line given in position, this power,\nor motion, has no effect to cause the body to approach towards that\nline, or recede from it, but to move in a line parallel to a right line\nonly; as appears from the second law of motion: therefore c a being\nparallel to d b--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis pupil having listened to him thus far, could contain himself no\nlonger, but interrupted the investigation with a loud laugh, and\ntold him that his postulata put him in mind of a certain learned and\ningenious gentleman, who undertook to disprove the existence of natural\nevil, and asked no other datum on which to found his demonstration,\nbut an acknowledgment that \u00e2\u0080\u009ceverything that is, is right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may\ntherefore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, in a peremptory tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cspare yourself the trouble\nof torturing your invention; for, after all, I am pretty certain that\nI shall want capacity to comprehend the discussion of your lemma, and\nconsequently be obliged to all the pangs of an ingenuous mind that I\nrefuse my assent to your deduction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Jolter was disconcerted at this declaration, and so much offended\nat Peregrine's disrespect, that he could not help expressing his\ndispleasure, by telling him flatly, that he was too violent and\nheadstrong to be reclaimed by reason and gentle means; that he (the\ntutor) must be obliged, in the discharge of his duty and conscience, to\ninform the commodore of his pupil's imprudence; that if the laws of this\nrealm were effectual, they would take cognizance of the gipsy who\nhad led him astray; and observed, by way of contrast, that if such\na preposterous intrigue had happened in France, she would have been\nclapped up in a convent two years ago. Our lover's eyes kindled with\nindignation, when he heard his mistress treated with such irreverence:\nhe could scarce refrain from inflicting manual chastisement on the\nblasphemer, whom he reproached in his wrath as an arrogant pedant,\nwithout either delicacy or sense, and cautioned him against rising any\nsuch impertinent freedoms with his affairs for the future on pain of\nincurring more severe effects of his resentment.\n\nMr. Jolter, who entertained very high notions of that veneration to\nwhich he thought himself entitled by his character and qualifications,\nhad not borne, without repining, his want of influence and authority\nover his pupil, against whom he cherished a particular grudge ever since\nthe adventure of the painted eye; and therefore, on this occasion, his\npolitic forbearance had been overcome by the accumulated motives of his\ndisgust. Indeed, he would have resigned his charge with disdain, had\nnot he been encouraged to persevere, by the hopes of a good living which\nTrunnion had in his gift, or known how to dispose of himself for the\npresent to better advantage.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n\n\nHe receives a Letter from his Aunt, breaks with the Commodore, and\ndisobliges the Lieutenant, who, nevertheless, undertakes his Cause.\n\n\nMeanwhile he quitted the youth in high dudgeon, and that same evening\ndespatched a letter for Mrs. Trunnion, which was dictated by the\nfirst transports of his passion, and of course replete with severe\nanimadversions on the misconduct of his pupil. In consequence of this\ncomplaint, it was not long before Peregrine received an epistle from his\naunt, wherein she commemorated all the circumstances of the commodore's\nbenevolence towards him, when he was helpless and forlorn, deserted and\nabandoned by his own parents; upbraided him for his misbehaviour, and\nneglect of his tutor's advice; and insisted upon his breaking off an\nintercourse with that girl who had seduced his youth, as he valued the\ncontinuance of her affection and her husband's regard.\n\nAs our lover's own ideas of generosity were extremely refined, he was\nshocked at the indelicate insinuations of Mrs. Trunnion, and felt all\nthe pangs of an ingenuous mind that labours under obligations to a\nperson whom it contemns. Far from obeying her injunction, or humbling\nhimself by a submissive answer to her reprehension, his resentment\nbuoyed him up above every selfish consideration: he resolved to attach\nhimself to Emilia, if possible, more than ever; and although he was\ntempted to punish the officiousness of Jolter, by recriminating upon\nhis life and conversation, he generously withstood the impulse of his\npassion, because he knew that his governor had no other dependence than\nthe good opinion of the commodore. He could not, however, digest in\nsilence the severe expostulations of his aunt; to which he replied by\nthe following letter, addressed to her husband:--\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,--Though my temper could never stoop to offer nor, I\n    believe, your disposition deign to receive, that gross incense\n    which the illiberal only expect, and none but the base-minded\n    condescend to pay; my sentiments have always done justice to\n    your generosity, and my intention scrupulously adhered to the\n    dictates of my duty. Conscious of this integrity of heart, I\n    cannot but severely feel your lady's unkind (I will not call\n    it ungenerous) recapitulation of the favours I have received;\n    and, as I take it for granted that you knew and approved of her\n    letter, I must beg leave to assure you, that, far from being\n    swayed by menaces and reproach, I am determined to embrace the\n    most abject extremity of fortune, rather than submit to such\n    dishonourable compulsion. When I am treated in a more delicate\n    and respectful manner, I hope I shall behave as becomes,--Sir,\n    your obliged\n                                \u00e2\u0080\u009cP. Pickle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThe commodore, who did not understand those nice distinctions of\nbehaviour, and dreaded the consequence of Peregrine's amour, against\nwhich he was strangely prepossessed, seemed exasperated at the insolence\nand obstinacy of this adopted son; to whose epistle he wrote the\nfollowing answer, which was transmitted by the hands of Hatchway, who\nhad orders to bring the delinquent along with him to the garrison:--\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cHark ye, child,--You need not bring your fine speeches to bear\n    upon me: you only expend your ammunition to no purpose. Your\n    aunt told you nothing but truth; for it is always fair and\n    honest to be above-board, d'ye see. I am informed as how you\n    are in chase of a painted galley, which will decoy you upon the\n    flats of destruction, unless you keep a better look-out and a\n    surer reckoning than you have hitherto done; and I have sent\n    Jack Hatchway to see how the land lies, and warn you of your\n    danger: if so be as you will put about ship, and let him steer\n    you into this harbour, you shall meet with a safe berth and\n    friendly reception; but if you refuse to alter your course you\n    cannot expect any farther assistance from yours as you behave,\n                                   \u00e2\u0080\u009cHawser Trunnion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nPeregrine was equally piqued and disconcerted at the receipt of this\nletter, which was quite different from what he had expected; and\ndeclared in a resolute tone to the lieutenant, who brought it, that he\nmight return as soon as he pleased, for he was determined to consult his\nown inclination, and remain for some time longer where he was.\n\nHatchway endeavoured to persuade him, by all the arguments which his\nsagacity and friendship could supply, to show a little more deference\nfor the old man, who was by this time rendered fretful and peevish by\nthe gout, which now hindered him from enjoying himself as usual, who\nmight, in his passion, take some step very much to the detriment of the\nyoung gentleman, whom he had hitherto considered as his own son. Among\nother remonstrances, Jack observed that mayhap Peregrine had got under\nEmilia's hatches, and did not choose to set her adrift; and that if that\nwas the case, he himself would take charge of the vessel, and see her\ncargo safely delivered; for he had a respect for the young woman, and\nhis needle pointed towards matrimony; and as, in all probability, she\ncould not be much the worse for the wear, he would make shift to scud\nthrough life with her under an easy sail.\n\nOur lover was deaf to all his admonitions, and, having thanked him\nfor this last instance of his complaisance, repeated his resolution of\nadhering to his first purpose. Hatchway, having profited so little by\nmild exhortations: assumed a more peremptory aspect, and plainly told\nhim that he neither could nor would go home without him; so he had best\nmake immediate preparation for the voyage.\n\nPeregrine made no other reply to this declaration than by a contemptuous\nsmile, and rose from his seat in order to retire; upon which the\nlieutenant started up, and, posting himself by the door, protested,\nwith some menacing gestures, that he would not suffer him to run a-head\nneither. The other, incensed at his presumption in attempting to detain\nhim by force, tripped up his wooden leg, and laid him on his back in a\nmoment; then walked deliberately towards the park, in order to indulge\nhis reflection, which at that time teemed with disagreeable thoughts. He\nhad not proceeded two hundred steps when he heard something blowing and\nstamping behind him; and, looking back, perceived the lieutenant at his\nheels, with rage and indignation in his countenance. This exasperated\nseaman, impatient of the affront he had received, and forgetting all the\ncircumstances of their former intimacy, advanced with great eagerness\nto his old friend, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook ye, brother, you're a saucy boy, and if\nyou was at sea, I would have your backside brought to the davit for your\ndisobedience; but as we are on shore, you and I must crack a pistol at\none another: here is a brace; you shall take which you please.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPeregrine, upon recollection, was sorry for having been laid under the\nnecessity of disobliging honest Jack, and very frankly asked his pardon\nfor what he had done. But this condescension was misinterpreted by the\nother, who refused any other satisfaction but that which an officer\nought to claim; and, with some irreverent expressions, asked if Perry\nwas afraid of his bacon? The youth, inflamed at this unjust insinuation,\ndarted a ferocious look at the challenger, told him he had paid but too\nmuch regard to his infirmities, and bid him walk forward to the park,\nwhere he would soon convince him of his error, if he thought his\nconcession proceeded from fear.\n\nAbout this time, they were overtaken by Pipes, who, having heard the\nlieutenant's fall and seen him pocket his pistols, suspected there was\na quarrel in the case, and followed him with a view of protecting\nhis master. Peregrine, seeing him arrive, and guessing his intention,\nassumed an air of serenity; and pretending that he had left his\nhandkerchief at the inn, ordered his man to go thither and fetch it to\nhim in the park, where he would find them at his return. This command\nwas twice repeated before Tom would take any other notice of the\nmessage, except by shaking his head; but being urged with many threats\nand curses to obedience, he gave them to understand that he knew their\ndrift too well to trust them by themselves. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs for you, Lieutenant\nHatchway,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been your shipmate, and know you to be a\nsailor, that's enough; and as for master, I know him to be as good a man\nas ever stept betwixt stem and stern, whereby, if you have anything to\nsay to him, I am your man, as the saying is. Here's my sapling, and I\ndon't value your crackers of a rope's end.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This oration, the longest\nthat ever Pipes was known to make, he concluded with a flourish of his\ncudgel, and enforced with such determined refusals to leave them, that\nthey found it impossible to bring the cause to mortal arbitrement at\nthat time, and strolled about the park in profound silence; during\nwhich, Hatchway's indignation subsiding, he, all of a sudden, thrust out\nhis hand as an advance to reconciliation, which being cordially shaken\nby Peregrine, a general pacification ensued; and was followed by a\nconsultation about the means of extricating the youth from his present\nperplexity. Had his disposition been like that of most other young men,\nit would have been no difficult task to overcome his difficulties; but\nsuch was the obstinacy of his pride, that he deemed himself bound in\nhonour to resent the letters he had received; and instead of submitting\nto the pleasure of the commodore, expected an acknowledgment from him,\nwithout which he would listen to no terms of accommodation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHad I been\nhis own son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should have borne his reproof, and sued for\nforgiveness; but knowing myself to be on the footing of an orphan, who\ndepends entirely upon his benevolence, I am jealous of everything that\ncan be construed into disrespect, and insist upon being treated with the\nmost punctual regard. I shall now make application to my father, who is\nobliged to provide for me by the ties of nature, as well as the laws\nof the land; and if he shall refuse to do me justice, I can never want\nemployment while men are required for his Majesty's service.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe lieutenant, alarmed at this intimation, begged he would take no new\nstep until he should hear from him; and that very evening set out for\nthe garrison, where he gave Trunnion an account of the miscarriage\nof his negotiation, told him how highly Peregrine was offended at the\nletter, communicated the young gentleman's sentiments and resolution,\nand finally assured him that unless he should think proper to ask pardon\nfor the offence he had committed, he would, in all appearance, never\nmore behold the face of his godson.\n\nThe old commodore was utterly confounded at this piece of intelligence:\nhe had expected all the humility of obedience and contrition from the\nyoung man; and, instead of that, received nothing but the most indignant\nopposition, and even found himself in the circumstances of an offender,\nobliged to make atonement, or forfeit all correspondence with his\nfavourite. These insolent conditions at first threw him into an agony of\nwrath; and he vented execrations with such rapidity that he left himself\nno time to breathe, and had almost been suffocated with his choler.\nHe inveighed bitterly against the ingratitude of Peregrine, whom he\nmentioned with many opprobrious epithets, and swore that he ought to be\nkeelhauled for his presumption; but when he began to reflect more coolly\nupon the spirit of the young gentleman, which had already manifested\nitself on many occasions, and listened to the suggestions of Hatchway,\nwhom he had always considered as an oracle in his way, his resentment\nabated, and he determined to take Perry into favour again; this\nplacability being not a little facilitated by Jack's narrative of our\nhero's intrepid behaviour at the assembly, as well as the contest with\nhim in the park. But still this plaguy amour occurred like a bugbear to\nhis imagination; for he held it as an infallible maxim, that woman was\nan eternal source of misery to man. Indeed, this apophthegm he seldom\nrepeated since his marriage, except in the company of a very few\nintimates, to whose secrecy and discretion he could trust. Finding\nJack himself at a nonplus in the affair of Emilia, he consulted Mrs.\nTrunnion, who was equally surprised and offended when she understood\nthat her letter did not produce the desired effect; and after having\nimputed the youth's obstinacy to his uncle's unseasonable indulgence,\nhad recourse to the advice of the parson, who, still with an eye to his\nfriend's advantage, counselled them to send the young gentleman on his\ntravels, in the course of which he would, in all probability, forget\nthe amusements of his greener years. The proposal was judicious, and\nimmediately approved; when Trunnion, going into his closet, after divers\nefforts, produced the following billet, with which Jack departed for\nWindsor that same afternoon:--\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy good lad,--If I gave offence in my last letter I'm sorry\n    for't, d'ye see: I thought it was the likeliest way to bring\n    you up; but, in time to come, you shall have a larger swing\n    of cable. When you can spare time, I should be glad if you will\n    make a short trip and see your aunt, and him who is--Your\n    loving godfather and humble servant,\n                                   \u00e2\u0080\u009cHawser Trunnion.\n\n    P.S. If you want money, you may draw upon me payable at sight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\n\n\nHe becomes Melancholy and Despondent--Is favoured with the condescending\nLetter from his Uncle--Reconciles himself to his Governor, and sets out\nwith Emilia and her Friend for Mrs. Gauntlet's House.\n\n\nPeregrine, fortified as he was with pride and indignation, did not fail\nto feel the smarting suggestions of his present situation: after having\nlived so long in an affluent and imperious manner, he could ill brook\nthe thoughts of submitting to the mortifying exigencies of life. All the\ngaudy schemes of pomp and pleasure, which his luxuriant imagination had\nformed, began to dissolve; a train of melancholy ideas took possession\nof his thoughts; and the prospect of losing Emilia was not the least\npart of his affliction. Though he endeavoured to suppress the chagrin\nthat preyed upon his heart, he could not conceal the disturbance of his\nmind from the penetration of that amiable young lady, who sympathized\nwith him in her heart, though she could not give her tongue the liberty\nof asking the cause of his disorder; for, notwithstanding all the ardour\nof his addresses, he never could obtain from her the declaration of\na mutual flame; because, though he had hitherto treated her with the\nutmost reverence of respect, he had never once mentioned the final\naim of his passion. However honourable she supposed it to be, she had\ndiscernment enough to foresee that vanity or interest, co-operating with\nthe levity of youth, might one day deprive her of her lover, and she was\ntoo proud to give him any handle of exulting at her expense. Although\nhe was received by her with the most distinguished civility, and even\nan intimacy of friendship, all his solicitations could never extort\nfrom her an acknowledgment of love: on the contrary, being of a gay\ndisposition, she sometimes coquetted with other admirers, that his\nattention thus whetted might never abate, and that he might see she had\nother resources in case he should flag in his affection.\n\nThis being the prudential plan on which she acted, it cannot be supposed\nthat she would condescend to inquire into the state of his thoughts when\nshe saw him thus affected; but she, nevertheless, imposed that task\non her cousin and confidant, who, as they walked together in the park\nobserved that he seemed to be out of humour. When this is the case, such\na question generally increases the disease; at least it had that effect\nupon Peregrine, who replied somewhat peevishly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI assure you, madam,\nyou never were more mistaken in your observations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think so,\ntoo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Emilia, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I never saw Mr. Pickle in higher spirits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This\nironical encomium completed his confusion: he affected to smile, but it\nwas a smile of anguish, and in his heart he cursed the vivacity of both.\nHe could not for his soul recollect himself so as to utter one connected\nsentence; and the suspicion that they observed every circumstance of\nhis behaviour, threw such a damp on his spirits that he was quite\noverwhelmed with shame and resentment, when Sophy, casting her eyes\ntowards the gate, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYonder is your servant, Mr. Pickle, with\nanother man who seems to have a wooden leg.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Peregrine started at this\nintelligence, and immediately underwent sundry changes of complexion,\nknowing that his fate, in a great measure, depended upon the information\nhe would receive from his friend.\n\nHatchway, advancing to the company, after a brace of sea bows to the\nladies, took the youth aside, and put the commodore's letter into\nhis hand, which threw him into such an agitation that he could scarce\npronounce, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLadies, will you give me leave?\u00e2\u0080\u009d When, in consequence of\ntheir permission, he attempted to open the billet, he fumbled with such\nmanifest disorder, that his mistress, who watched his motions, began to\nthink that there was something very interesting in the message; and so\nmuch was she affected with his concern, that she was fain to turn her\nhead another way, and wipe the tears from her lovely eyes.\n\nMeanwhile, Peregrine no sooner read the first sentence than his\ncountenance, which before was overcast with a deep gloom, began to be\nlighted up, and every feature unbending by degrees, he recovered his\nserenity. Having perused the letter, his eyes sparkling with joy and\ngratitude, he hugged the lieutenant in his arms, and presented him to\nthe ladies as one of his best friends. Jack met with a most gracious\nreception, and shook Emilia by the hand, telling her, with the familiar\nappellation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cold acquaintance\u00e2\u0080\u009d that he did not care how soon he was\nmaster of such another clean-going frigate as herself. The whole company\npartook of this favourable change that evidently appeared in our lover's\nrecollection, and enlivened his conversation with such an uncommon flow\nof sprightliness and good humour, as even made an impression on the iron\ncountenance of Pipes himself, who actually smiled with satisfaction as\nhe walked behind them.\n\nThe evening being pretty far advanced, they directed their course\nhomeward; and while the valet attended Hatchway to the inn, Peregrine\nescorted the ladies to their lodgings, where he owned the justness of\nSophy's remark in saying he was out of humour, and told them he had been\nextremely chagrined at a difference which had happened between him and\nhis uncle, to whom, by the letter which they had seen him receive, he\nnow found himself happily reconciled.\n\nHaving received their congratulations, and declined staying to sup\nwith them, on account of the longing desire he had to converse with his\nfriend Jack, he took his leave, and repaired to the inn, where Hatchway\ninformed him of everything that had happened in the garrison upon his\npresentations. Far from being disgusted, he was perfectly well pleased\nwith the prospect of going abroad, which flattered his vanity and\nambition, gratified his thirst after knowledge, and indulged that turn\nfor observation, for which he had been remarkable from his most\ntender years. Neither did he believe a short absence would tend to the\nprejudice of his love, but, on the contrary, enhance the value of his\nheart, because he should return better accomplished, consequently, a\nmore welcome offering to his mistress. Elevated with these sentiments,\nhis heart dilated with joy; and the sluices of his natural benevolence\nbeing opened by this happy turn of his affairs, he sent his compliment\nto Mr. Jolter, to whom he had not spoken during a whole week, and\ndesired he would favour Mr. Hatchway and him with his company at supper.\n\nThe governor was not weak enough to decline this invitation; in\nconsequence of which he forthwith appeared, and was cordially\nwelcomed by the relenting pupil, who expressed his sorrow for the\nmisunderstanding which had prevailed between them, and assured him that\nfor the future he would avoid giving him any just cause of complaint.\nJolter, who did not want affections, was melted by this acknowledgment,\nwhich he could not have expected; and earnestly protested, that his\nchief study had always been, and ever should be, to promote Mr. Pickle's\ninterest and happiness.\n\nThe best part of the night being spent in the circulation of a cheerful\nglass, the company broke up; and next morning Peregrine went out with\na view of making his mistress acquainted with his uncle's intention\nof sending him out of the kingdom for his improvement, and of saying\neverything which he thought necessary for the interest of his love. He\nfound her at breakfast with her cousin; and, as he was very full of\nthe subject of his visit, had scarce fixed himself in his seat, when he\nbrought it upon the carpet, by asking, with a smile, if the ladies had\nany commands for Paris? Emilia at this question began to stare, and her\nconfidant desired to know who was going thither? He no sooner gave\nto understand that he himself intended in a short time to visit that\ncapital, than his mistress with great precipitation wished him a good\njourney, and affected to talk with indifference the pleasures he would\nenjoy in France; but when he seriously assured Sophy, who asked if he\nwas in earnest, and his uncle actually insisted upon his making a short\ntour, the tears gushed in poor Emilia's eyes, and she was at great pains\nto conceal her concern, by observing that the tea was so scalding hot,\nas to make her eyes water. This pretext was too thin to impose upon her\nlover, or even deceive the observation of her friend Sophy, who, after\nbreakfast, took an opportunity of quitting the room.\n\nThus left by themselves, Peregrine imparted to her what he had learnt\nof the commodore's intention, without, however, mentioning a syllable\nof his being offended at their correspondence; and accompanied his\ninformation with such fervent vows of eternal constancy and solemn\npromises of a speedy return, that Emily's heart, which had been invaded\nby a suspicion that this scheme of travelling was an effect of her\nlover's inconstancy, began to be more at ease; and she could not help\nsignifying her approbation of his design.\n\nThis affair being amicably compromised, he asked how soon she proposed\nto set out for her mother's house; and understanding that her departure\nwas fixed for next day but one, and that her Cousin Sophy intended to\naccompany her in her father's chariot, he repeated his intention of\nattending her. In the mean time he dismissed the governor and the\nlieutenant to the garrison, with his compliments to his aunt and the\ncommodore, and a faithful promise of his being with them in six days at\nfarthest. These previous measures being taken, he, attended by Pipes,\nset out with the ladies; and they had also a convoy for twelve miles\nfrom Sophy's father, who, at parting, recommended them piously to\nthe care of Peregrine, with whom by this time, he was perfectly well\nacquainted.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\n\n\nThey meet with a dreadful Alarm on the Road--Arrive at their Journey's\nend--Peregrine is introduced to Emily's Brother--These two young\nGentlemen misunderstand each other--Pickle departs for the Garrison.\n\n\nAs they travelled at an easy rate, they had performed something more\nthan one half of their journey, when they were benighted near an inn,\nat which they resolved to lodge; the accommodation was very good, they\nsupped together with great mirth and enjoyment, and it was not till\nafter he had been warned by the yawns of the ladies, that he conducted\nthem to their apartment; where, wishing them good night, he retired to\nhis own, and went to rest. The house was crowded with country-people who\nhad been at a neighbouring fair, and now regaled themselves with ale and\ntobacco in the yard; so that their consideration, which at any time was\nbut slender, being now overwhelmed by this debauch, they staggered into\ntheir respective kennels, and left a lighted candle sticking to one of\nthe wooden pillars that supported the gallery. The flame in a little\ntime laid hold on the wood, which was as dry as tinder; and the whole\ngallery was on fire, when Peregrine suddenly waked, and found himself\nalmost suffocated. He sprang up in an instant, slipped on his breeches,\nand, throwing open the door of his chamber, saw the whole entry in a\nblaze.\n\nHeavens! what were the emotions of his soul, when he beheld the volumes\nof flame and smoke rolling towards the room where his dear Emilia lay!\nRegardless of his own danger, he darted himself through the thickest\nof the gloom, when knocking hard, and calling at the same time to the\nladies, with the most anxious entreaty to be admitted, the door was\nopened by Emilia in her shift, who asked, with the utmost trepidation,\nwhat was the matter? He made no reply, but snatching her up in his arms,\nlike another Aeneas, bore her through the flames to a place of safety;\nwhere leaving her before she could recollect herself, or pronounce one\nword, but \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlas; my Cousin Sophy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he flew back to the rescue of that\nyoung lady, and found her already delivered by Pipes, who having been\nalarmed by the smell of fire, had got up, rushed immediately to the\nchamber where he knew these companions lodged, and Emily being saved by\nher lover brought off Miss Sophy with the loss of his own shock-head of\nhair, which was singed off in his retreat.\n\nBy this time the whole inn was alarmed; every lodger, as well as\nservant, exerted himself, in order to stop the progress of this\ncalamity: and there being a well-replenished horse-pond in the yard, in\nless than an hour the fire was totally extinguished, without having done\nany other damage than that of consuming about two yards of the wooden\ngallery.\n\nAll this time our young gentleman closely attended his fair charge, each\nof whom had swooned with apprehension; but as their constitutions were\ngood, and their spirits not easily dissipated, when upon reflection\nthey found themselves and their company safe, and that the flames were\nhappily quenched, the tumult of their fears subsided, they put on their\nclothes, recovered their good humour, and began to rally each other on\nthe trim in which they had been secured. Sophy observed that now\nMr. Pickle had an indisputable claim to her cousin's affection; and\ntherefore she ought to lay aside all affected reserve for the future,\nand frankly avow the sentiments of her heart. Emily retorted the\nargument, putting her in mind, that by the same claim Mr. Pipes was\nentitled to the like return from her. Her friend admitted the force\nof the conclusion, provided she could not find means of satisfying his\ndeliverer in another shape; and, turning, to the valet, who happened to\nbe present, asked if his heart was not otherwise engaged. Tom, who did\nnot conceive the meaning of the question, stood silent according to\ncustom; and the interrogation being repeated, answered, with a grin,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeart-whole as a biscuit, I'll assure you, mistress.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nEmilia, \u00e2\u0080\u009chave you never been in love, Thomas?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, forsooth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied\nthe valet without hesitation, \u00e2\u0080\u009csometimes of a morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPeregrine could not help laughing, and his mistress looked a little\ndisconcerted at this blunt repartee: while Sophy, slipping a purse\ninto his hand, told him there was something to purchase a periwig. Tom,\nhaving consulted his master's eyes, refused the present, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\nthank ye as much as if I did;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and though she insisted upon his putting\nit in his pocket, as a small testimony of her gratitude, he could not be\nprevailed upon to avail himself of her generosity; but following her to\nthe other end of the room, thrust it into her sleeve without ceremony,\nexclaiming, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll be d--d to hell if I do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Peregrine, having checked\nhim for his boorish behaviour, sent him out of the room, and begged that\nMiss Sophy would not endeavour to debauch the morals of his servant,\nwho, rough and uncultivated as he was, had sense enough to perceive that\nhe had no pretension to any such acknowledgment. But she argued, with\ngreat vehemence, that she should never be able to make acknowledgment\nadequate to the service he had done her, and that she should never\nbe perfectly easy in her own mind until she found some opportunity of\nmanifesting the sense she had of the obligation: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not pretend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto reward Mr. Pipes; but I shall be absolutely unhappy,\nunless I am allowed to give him some token of my regard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPeregrine, thus earnestly solicited, desired, that since she was bent\nupon displaying her generosity, she would not bestow upon him any\npecuniary gratification, but honour him with some trinket, as a mark of\nconsideration; because he himself had such a particular value for the\nfellow, on account of his attachment and fidelity, that he should be\nsorry to see him treated on the footing of a common mercenary domestic.\nThere was not one jewel in the possession of this grateful young lady,\nthat she would not have gladly given as a recompense, or badge of\ndistinction, to her rescuer; but his master pitched upon a seal ring of\nno great value that hung at her watch, and Pipes, being called in, had\npermission to accept that testimony of Miss Sophy's favour. Tom received\nit accordingly with sundry scrapes; and, having kissed it with great\ndevotion, put it on his little finger, and strutted off, extremely proud\nof his acquisition.\n\nEmilia, with a most enchanting sweetness of aspect, told her lover that\nhe had instructed her how to behave towards him; and taking a diamond\nring from her finger, desired he would wear it for her sake. He received\nthe pledge as became him, and presented another in exchange, which\nshe at first refused, alleging that it would destroy the intent of her\nacknowledgment; but Peregrine assured her he had accepted her jewel, not\nas a proof of her gratitude, but as the mark of her love; and that if\nshe refused a mutual token, he should look upon himself as the object of\nher disdain. Her eyes kindled, and her cheeks glowed with resentment\nat this impudent intimation, which she considered as an unseasonable\ninsult, and the young gentleman, perceiving her emotion, stood corrected\nfor his temerity, and asked pardon for the liberty of his remonstrance,\nwhich he hoped she would ascribe to the prevalence of that principle\nalone, which he had always taken pride in avowing.\n\nSophy, seeing him disconcerted, interposed in his behalf, and chid her\ncousin for having practised such unnecessary affectation; upon which,\nEmilia, softened into compliance, held out her finger as a signal of\nher condescension. Peregrine put on the ring with great eagerness, and\nmumbled her soft white hand in an ecstasy which would not allow him to\nconfine his embraces to that limb, but urged him to seize her by the\nwaist, and snatch a delicious kiss from her love-pouting lips; nor\nwould he leave her a butt to the ridicule of Sophy, on whose mouth he\ninstantly committed a rape of the same nature: so that the two friends,\ncountenanced by each other, reprehended him with such gentleness of\nrebuke, that he was almost tempted to repeat the offence.\n\nThe morning being now lighted up, and the servants of the inn on foot,\nhe ordered some chocolate for breakfast, and at the desire of the\nladies, sent Pipes to see the horses fed, and the chariot prepared,\nwhile he went to the bar, and discharged the bill.\n\nThese measures being taken, they set out about five o'clock, and having\nrefreshed themselves and their cattle at another inn on the road,\nproceeded in the afternoon. Without meeting with any other accident,\nthey safely arrived at the place of their destination, where Mrs.\nGauntlet expressed her joy at seeing her old friend Mr. Pickle, whom,\nhowever, she kindly reproached for the long discontinuance of his\nregard. Without explaining the cause of that interruption, he protested\nthat his love and esteem had never been discontinued, and that for the\nfuture he should omit no occasion of testifying how much he had her\nfriendship at heart. She then made him acquainted with her son, who at\nthat time was in the house, being excused from his duty by furlough.\n\nThis young man, whose name was Godfrey, was about the age of twenty, of\na middling size, vigorous make, remarkably well-shaped, and the scars\nof the small-pox, of which he bore a good number, added a peculiar\nmanliness to the air of his countenance. His capacity was good, and his\ndisposition naturally frank and easy; but he had been a soldier from\nhis infancy, and his education was altogether in the military style.\nHe looked upon taste and letters as mere pedantry, beneath the\nconsideration of a gentleman, and every civil station of life as mean,\nwhen compared with the profession of arms. He had made great progress in\nthe gymnastic sciences of dancing, fencing, and riding; played perfectly\nwell on the German flute; and, above all things valued himself upon a\nscrupulous observance of all the points of honour.\n\nHad Peregrine and he considered themselves upon equal footing, in\nall probability they would have immediately entered into a league of\nintimacy and friendship: but this sufficient soldier looked upon his\nsister's admirer as a young student raw from the university, and utterly\nignorant of mankind; while Squire Pickle beheld Godfrey in the light of\na needy volunteer, greatly inferior to himself in fortune, as well as\nevery other accomplishment. This mutual misunderstanding could not fail\nof animosities. The very next day after Peregrine's arrival, some sharp\nrepartees passed between them in presence of the ladies, before whom\neach endeavoured to assert his own superiority. In these contests our\nhero never failed of obtaining the victory, because his genius was more\nacute, and his talents better cultivated, than those of his antagonist,\nwho therefore took umbrage at his success, became jealous of his\nreputation, and began to treat him with marks of scorn and disrespect.\n\nHis sister saw, and, dreading the consequence of his ferocity, not\nonly took him to task in private for his impolite behaviour, but\nalso entreated her lover to make allowances for the roughness of her\nbrother's education. He kindly assured her, that whatever pains it might\ncost him to vanquish his own impetuous temper, he would, for her sake,\nendure all the mortifications to which her brother's arrogance might\nexpose him; and, after having stayed with her two days, and enjoyed\nseveral private interviews, during which he acted the part of a most\npassionate lover, he took his leave of Mrs. Gauntlet overnight, and told\nthe young ladies he would call early next morning to bid them farewell.\nHe did not neglect this piece of duty, and found the two friends and\nbreakfast already prepared in the parlour. All three being extremely\naffected with the thoughts of parting, a most pathetic silence for some\ntime prevailed, till Peregrine put an end to it by lamenting his fate,\nin being obliged to exile himself so long from the dear object of his\nmost interesting wish. He begged, with the most earnest supplications,\nthat she would now, in consideration of the cruel absence he must\nsuffer, give him the consolation which she had hitherto refused; namely,\nthat of knowing he possessed a place within her heart. The confidante\nseconded his request, representing that it was now no time to disguise\nher sentiments, when her lover was about to leave the kingdom, and might\nbe in danger of contracting other connections, unless he was confirmed\nin his constancy, by knowing how far he could depend upon her love; and,\nin short, she was plied with such irresistible importunities, that\nshe answered in the utmost confusion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThough I have avoided literal\nacknowledgments, methinks the circumstances of my behaviour might\nhave convinced Mr. Pickle that I do not regard him as a common\nacquaintance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy charming Emily,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the impatient lover, throwing\nhimself at her feet, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy will you deal out my happiness in such scanty\nportions? Why will you thus mince the declaration which would overwhelm\nme with pleasure, and cheer my lonely reflection, while I sigh amid\nthe solitude of separation?\u00e2\u0080\u009d His fair mistress, melted by this image,\nreplied, with the tears gushing from her eyes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm afraid I shall feel\nthat separation more severely than you imagine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Transported at this\nflattering confession, he pressed her to his breast, and while her head\nreclined upon his neck, mingled his tears with hers in great abundance,\nbreathing the most tender vows of eternal fidelity. The gentle heart\nof Sophy could not bear this scene unmoved: she wept with sympathy,\nand encouraged the lovers to resign themselves to the will of fate, and\nsupport their spirits with the hope of meeting again on happier terms.\nFinally, after mutual promises, exhortations, and endearments, Peregrine\ntook his leave, his heart being so full that he could scarce pronounce\nthe word Adieu! and, mounting his horse at the door, set out with Pipes\nfor the garrison.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\n\n\nPeregrine is overtaken by Mr. Gauntlet, with whom he fights a Duel, and\ncontracts an intimate Friendship--He arrives at the Garrison, and finds\nhis Mother as implacable as ever--He is insulted by his Brother Gam,\nwhose Preceptor he disciplines with a Horsewhip.\n\n\nIn order to expel the melancholy images that took possession of his\nfancy, at parting from his mistress, he called in the flattering ideas\nof those pleasures he expected to enjoy in France; and before he had\nrode ten miles, his imagination was effectually amused. While he thus\nprosecuted his travels by anticipation, and indulged himself in all\nthe insolence of hope, at the turning of a lane he was all of a sudden\novertaken by Emilia's brother on horseback, who told him he was riding\nthe same way, and should be glad of his company. This young gentleman,\nwhether prompted by personal pique, or actuated with zeal for the honour\nof his family, had followed our hero, with the view of obliging him to\nexplain the nature of his attachment to his sister.\n\nPeregrine returned his compliment with such disdainful civility as gave\nhim room to believe that he suspected his errand; and therefore, without\nfurther preamble, he declared his business in these words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Pickle,\nyou have carried on a correspondence with my sister for some time, and\nI should be glad to know the nature of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To this question our lover\nreplied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir, I should be glad to know what title you have to demand\nthat satisfaction?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the other, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI demand it in the\ncapacity of a brother, jealous of his own honour, as well as of his\nsister's reputation; and if your intentions are honourable, you will\nnot refuse it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Peregrine, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not at present disposed to\nappeal to your opinion for the rectitude of my intentions: and I think\nyou assume a little too much importance, in pretending to judge my\nconduct.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the soldier, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI pretend to judge the conduct\nof every man who interferes with my concerns, and even to chastise\nhim, if I think he acts amiss.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cChastise!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the youth, with\nindignation in his looks, \u00e2\u0080\u009csure you dare not apply that term to\nme?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are mistaken,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Godfrey; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI dare do anything that becomes\nthe character of a gentleman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGentleman, God wot!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the other,\nlooking contemptuously at his equipage, which was none of the most\nsuperb, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca very pretty gentleman, truly!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe soldier's wrath was inflamed by this ironical repetition, the\ncontempt of which his conscious poverty made him feel; and he called his\nantagonist presumptuous boy, insolent upstart, and with other epithets,\nwhich Perry retorted with great bitterness. A formal challenge having\npassed between them, they alighted at the first inn, and walked into\nthe next field, in order to decide their quarrel by the sword. Having\npitched upon the spot, helped to pull off each other's boots, and laid\naside their coats and waistcoats, Mr. Gauntlet told his opponent, that\nhe himself was looked upon in the army as an expert swordsman, and\nthat if Mr. Pickle had not made that science his particular study, they\nshould be upon a more equal footing in using pistols. Peregrine was too\nmuch incensed to thank him for his plain dealing, and too confident\nof his own skill to relish the other's proposal, which he accordingly\nrejected: then, drawing his sword, he observed, that were he to treat\nMr. Gauntlet according to his deserts, he would order his man to punish\nhis audacity with a horsewhip. Exasperated at this expression, which he\nconsidered as an indelible affront, he made no reply, but attacked his\nadversary with equal ferocity and address. The youth parried his\nfirst and second thrust, but received the third in the outside of his\nsword-arm. Though the wound was superficial, he was transported with\nrage at sight of his own blood, and returned the assault with such\nfury and precipitation, that Gauntlet, loath to take advantage of\nhis unguarded heat, stood upon the defensive. In the second lounge,\nPeregrine's weapon entering a kind of network in the shell of Godfrey's\nsword, the blade snapped in two, and left him at the mercy of the\nsoldier, who, far from making an insolent use of the victory he had\ngained, put up his Toledo with great deliberation, like a man who had\nbeen used to that kind of reencounters, and observed that such a blade\nas Peregrine's was not to be trusted with a man's life: then advising\nthe owner to treat a gentleman in distress with more respect for the\nfuture, he slipped on his boots, and with sullen dignity of demeanour\nstalked back to the inn.\n\nThough Pickle was extremely mortified at his miscarriage in this\nadventure, he was also struck with the behaviour of his antagonist,\nwhich affected him the more, as he understood that Godfrey's fierte had\nproceeded from the jealous sensibility of a gentleman declined into the\nvale of misfortune. Gauntlet's valour and moderation induced him to\nput a favourable construction on all those circumstances of that young\nsoldier's conduct, which before had given him disgust. Though in any\nother case he would have industriously avoided the least appearance of\nsubmission, he followed his conqueror to the inn with a view of thanking\nhim for his generous forbearance, and of soliciting his friendship and\ncorrespondence.\n\nGodfrey had his foot in the stirrup to mount, when Peregrine, coming up\nto him, desired he would defer his departure for a quarter of an hour,\nand favour him with a little private conversation. The soldier, who\nmistook the meaning of the request, immediately quitted his horse, and\nfollowed Pickle into a chamber, where he expected to find a brace of\npistols loaded on the table: but he was very agreeably deceived,\nwhen our hero, in the most respectful terms, acknowledged his noble\ndeportment in the field, owned that till then he had misunderstood his\ncharacter, and begged that he would honour him with his intimacy and\ncorrespondence.\n\nGauntlet, who had seen undoubted proofs of Peregrine's courage, which\nhad considerably raised him in his esteem, and had sense enough to\nperceive that this concession was not owing to any sordid or sinister\nmotive, embraced his offer with demonstrations of infinite satisfaction.\nWhen he understood the terms on which Mr. Pickle was with his sister,\nhe proffered his service in his turn, either as agent, mediator, or\nconfidant: nay, to give this new friend a convincing proof of his\nsincerity, he disclosed to him a passion which he had for some time\nentertained for his cousin Miss Sophy, though he durst not reveal his\nsentiments to her father, lest he should be offended at his presumption,\nand withdraw his protection from the family.\n\nPeregrine's generous heart was wrung with anguish, when he understood\nthat this young gentleman, who was the only son of a distinguished\nofficer, had carried arms for the space of five years, without being\nable to obtain a subaltern's commission, though he always had behaved\nwith remarkable regularity and spirit, and, acquired the friendship and\nesteem of all the officers under whom he had served. He would, at that\ntime, with the utmost pleasure, have shared his finances with him; but\nas he would not run the risk of offending the young soldier's delicacy\nof honour by a premature exertion of his liberality, he resolved to\ninsinuate himself into an intimacy with him, before he would venture to\ntake such freedoms; and with that view pressed Mr. Gauntlet to accompany\nhim to the garrison, where he did not doubt of having influence enough\nto make him a welcome guest. Godfrey thanked him very courteously for\nhis invitation, which he said he could not immediately accept; but\npromised, if he would favour him with a letter, and fix the time at\nwhich he proposed to set out for France, he would endeavour to visit\nhim at the commodore's habitation, and from thence give him a convoy to\nDover. This new treaty being settled, and a dossil of lint, with a\nsnip of plaster, applied to our adventurer's wound, he parted from the\nbrother of his dear Emilia, to whom and his friend Sophy he sent his\nkindest wishes; and having lodged one night upon the road, arrived next\nday in the afternoon at the garrison, where he found all his friends in\ngood health, and overjoyed at his return.\n\nThe commodore, who was by this time turned of seventy, and altogether\ncrippled by the gout, seldom went abroad; and as his conversation was\nnot very entertaining, had but little company within doors; so that his\nspirits must have quite stagnated, had not they been kept in motion\nby the conversation of Hatchway, and received at different times a\nwholesome fillip from the discipline of his spouse, who, by the force of\npride, religion, and Cognac, had erected a most terrible tyranny in the\nhouse. There was such a quick circulation of domestics in the family,\nthat every suit of livery had been worn by figures of all dimensions.\nTrunnion himself had long before this time yielded to the torrent of her\narbitrary sway, though not without divers obstinate efforts to maintain\nhis liberty; and now, that he was disabled by his infirmities, when\nhe used to bear his empress singing the loud Orthyan song among the\nservants below, he would often in whispers communicate to the lieutenant\nhints of what he would do if so be as how he was not deprived of the use\nof his precious limbs. Hatchway was the only person whom the temper of\nMrs. Trunnion respected, either because she dreaded his ridicule, or\nlooked upon his person with eyes of affection. This being the situation\nof things in the garrison, it is not to be doubted that the old\ngentleman highly enjoyed the presence of Peregrine, who found means to\ningratiate himself so effectually with his aunt, that while he remained\nat home, she seemed to have exchanged the disposition of a tigress for\nthat of a gentle kid; but he found his own mother as implacable, and his\nfather as much henpecked, as ever.\n\nGamaliel, who now very seldom enjoyed the conversation of his old friend\nthe commodore, had some time ago entered into an amicable society,\nconsisting of the barber, apothecary, attorney, and exciseman of the\nparish, among whom he used to spend the evening at Tunley's, and listen\nto their disputes upon philosophy and politics with great comfort and\nedification, while his sovereign lady domineered at home as usual,\nvisited with pomp in the neighbourhood, and employed her chief care in\nthe education of her darling son Gam, who was now in the fifteenth year\nof his age, and so remarkable for his perverse disposition, that, in\nspite of his mother's influence and authority, he was not only hated,\nbut also despised, both at home and abroad. She had put him under the\ntuition of the curate, who lived in the family, and was obliged to\nattend him in all his exercises and excursions. This governor was a\nlow-bred fellow, who had neither experience nor ingenuity, but possessed\na large fund of adulation and servile complaisance, by which he had\ngained the good graces of Mrs. Pickle, and presided over all her\ndeliberations in the same manner as his superior managed those of Mrs.\nTrunnion.\n\nHe had one day rode out to take the air with his pupil, who, as I have\nalready observed, was odious to the poor people, for having killed\ntheir dogs and broken their inclosures, and, on account of his hump,\ndistinguished by the title of My Lord, when in a narrow lane they\nchanced to meet Peregrine on horseback. The young squire no sooner\nperceived his elder brother, for whom he had been instructed to\nentertain the most inveterate grudge, than he resolved to insult him en\npassant, and actually rode against him from gallop. Our hero, guessing\nhis aim, fixed himself in his stirrups, and by a dexterous management\nof the reins avoided the shock in such a manner as that their legs only\nshould encounter; by which means my lord was tilted out of his saddle,\nand in a twinkling laid sprawling in the dirt. The governor, enraged at\nthe disgrace of his charge, advanced with great insolence and fury, and\nstruck at Peregrine with his whip. Nothing could be more agreeable\nto our young gentleman than this assault, which furnished him with\nan opportunity of chastising an officious wretch, whose petulance and\nmalice he had longed to punish. He therefore, spurring up his horse\ntowards his antagonist, overthrew him in the middle of a hedge. Before\nhe had time to recollect himself from the confusion of the fall, Pickle\nalighted in a trice, and exercised his horsewhip with such agility about\nthe curate's face and ears, that he was fain to prostrate himself before\nhis enraged conqueror, and implore his forbearance in the most abject\nterms. While Peregrine was thus employed, his brother Gam had made shift\nto rise and attack him in the rear; for which reason, when the tutor was\nquelled, the victor faced about, snatched the weapon out of his hand,\nand having broken it to pieces, remounted his horse and rode off,\nwithout deigning to honour him with any other notice.\n\nThe condition in which they returned produced infinite clamour against\nthe conqueror, who was represented as a ruffian who had lain in ambush\nto make away with his brother, in whose defence the curate was said to\nhave received those cruel stripes that hindered him from appearing for\nthree whole weeks in the performance of his duty at church. Complaints\nwere made to the commodore, who, having inquired into the circumstances\nof the affair, approved of what his nephew had done, adding, with many\noaths, that provided Peregrine had been out of the scrape, he wished\nCrook-back had broken his neck in the fall.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\n\n\nHe projects a plan of Revenge, which is executed against the Curate.\n\n\nOur hero, exasperated at the villainy of the curate, in the treacherous\nmisrepresentation he had made of this encounter, determined to rise upon\nhim a method of revenge, which should be not only effectual but also\nunattended any bad consequence to himself. For this purpose he and\nHatchway, to whom he imparted his plan, went to the ale-house one\nevening, and called for an empty room, knowing there was no other but\nthat which they had chosen for the scene of action. This apartment was\na sort of a parlour that fronted the kitchen, with a window towards the\nyard, where after they had sat some time, the lieutenant found means to\namuse the landlord in discourse, while Peregrine, stepping out into\nthe yard, by the talent of mimickry, which he possessed in a surprising\ndegree, counterfeited a dialogue between the curate and Tunley's\nwife. This reaching the ears of the publican, for whose hearing it was\ncalculated, inflamed his naturally jealous disposition to such a degree,\nthat he could not conceal his emotion, but made a hundred efforts\nto quit the room; while the lieutenant, smoking his pipe with great\ngravity, as if he neither heard what passed nor took notice of the\nlandlord's disorder, detained him on the spot by a succession of\nquestions, which he could not refuse to answer, though he stood sweating\nwith agony all the time, stretching his neck every instant towards the\nwindow through which the voices were conveyed, scratching his head, and\nexhibiting sundry other symptoms of impatience and agitation. At length\nthe supposed conversation came to such a pitch of amorous complaisance,\nthat the husband, quite frantic with his imaginary disgrace, rushed\nout of the door crying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cComing, sir;\u00e2\u0080\u009d but as he was obliged to make a\ncircuit round one-half of the house, Peregrine had got in by the window\nbefore Tunley arrived in the yard.\n\nAccording to the feigned intelligence he had received, he ran directly\nto the barn, in expectation of making some very extraordinary discovery;\nand having employed some minutes in rummaging the straw to no purpose,\nreturned in a state of distraction to the kitchen, just as his wife\nchanced to enter at the other door. The circumstance of her appearance\nconfirmed him in the opinion that the deed was done. As the disease of\nbeing henpecked was epidemic in the parish, he durst not express the\nleast hint of his uneasiness to her, but resolved to take vengeance on\nthe libidinous priest, who he imagined had corrupted the chastity of his\nspouse.\n\nThe two confederates, in order to be certified that their scheme had\ntaken effect, as well as to blow up the flame which they had kindled,\ncalled for Tunley, in whose countenance they could easily discern his\nconfusion. Peregrine, desiring him to sit down and drink a glass with\nthem, began to interrogate him about his family, and, among other\nthings, asked him how long he had been married to that handsome wife.\nThis question, which was put with an arch significance of look, alarmed\nthe publican, who began to fear that Pickle had overheard his dishonour;\nand this suspicion was not at all removed when the lieutenant, with a\nsly regard, pronounced \u00e2\u0080\u009cTunley warn't you noosed by the curate?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\nI was,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the landlord, with an eagerness and perplexity of\ntone, as if he thought the lieutenant knew that thereby hung a tale: and\nHatchway supported the suspicion by \u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, as for that matter, the curate\nmay be a very sufficient man in his way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This transition from his wife\nto the curate convinced him that his shame was known to his guests; and,\nin the transport of his indignation, he pronounced with great emphasis,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA sufficient man! Odds heart! I believe they are all wolves in sheep's\nclothing. I wish to God I could see the day, master, when there shall\nnot be a priest, an exciseman, or a custom-house officer in the kingdom.\nAs for that fellow of a curate, if I do catch him--It don't signify\ntalking--But, by the Lord!--Gentlemen, my service to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe associates being satisfied, by these abrupt insinuations, that they\nhad so far succeeded in their aim, waited with impatience two or three\ndays in expectation of hearing that Tunley had fallen upon some method\nof being revenged for this imaginary wrong; but finding that either his\ninvention was too shallow, or his inclination too languid, to gratify\ntheir desire of his own accord, they determined to bring the affair to\nsuch a crisis, that he should not be able to withstand the opportunity\nof executing his vengeance. With this view, they one evening hired a boy\nto run to Mr. Pickle's house, and tell the curate that Mrs. Tunley being\ntaken suddenly ill, her husband desired he would come immediately and\npray with her. They had taken possession of a room in the house and\nHatchway engaging the landlord in conversation, Peregrine, in his return\nfrom the yard, observed, as if by accident, that the parson was gone\ninto the kitchen, in order, as he supposed, to catechise Tunley's wife.\n\nThe publican started at this intelligence, and, under pretence of\nserving another company in the next room, went out to the barn, where,\narming himself with a flail, he repaired to a lane through which the\ncurate was under a necessity of passing in his way home. There he lay\nin ambush with fell intent; and when the supposed author of his shame\narrived, greeted him in the dark with such a salutation as forced him\nto stagger backward three paces at least. If the second application had\ntaken effect, in all probability that spot would have been the\nboundary of the parson's mortal peregrination; but luckily for him, his\nantagonist was not expert in the management of his weapon, which, by a\ntwist of the thong that connected the legs, instead of pitching upon the\nhead of the astonished curate, descended in an oblique direction on\nhis own pate, with such a swing that the skull actually rang like an\napothecary's mortar, and ten thousand lights seemed to dance before his\neyes. The curate recollecting himself during the respite he obtained\nfrom this accident, and believing his aggressor to be some thief who\nlurked in that place for prey, resolved to make a running fight, until\nhe should arrive within cry of his habitation. With this design he\nraised up his cudgel for the defence of his head, and, betaking himself\nto his heels, began to roar for help with the lungs of a Stentor.\nTunley, throwing away the flail, which he durst no longer trust with\nthe execution of his revenge, pursued the fugitive with all the speed he\ncould exert; and the other, either unnerved by fear or stumbling over\na stone, was overtaken before he had run a hundred paces. He no sooner\nfelt the wind of the publican's fist that whistled round his ears, than\nhe fell flat upon the earth at full length, and the cudgel flew from his\nunclasping hand; when Tunley, springing like a tiger on his back, rained\nsuch a shower of blows upon his carcase, that he imagined himself\nunder the discipline of ten pairs of fists at least; yet the imaginary\ncuckold, not satisfied with annoying the priest in this manner, laid\nhold of one of his ears with his teeth, and bit so unmercifully, that\nthe curate was found almost entranced with pain by two labourers, at\nwhose approach the assailant retreated unperceived.\n\nThe lieutenant had posted himself at the window, in order to see the\nlandlord at his first return: and no sooner perceived him enter the\nyard, than he called him into the apartment, impatient to learn the\neffects of their stratagem. Tunley obeyed the summons, and appeared\nbefore his guests in all the violence of rage, disorder, and fatigue:\nhis nostrils were dilated more than one-half beyond their natural\ncapacity, his eyes rolled, his teeth chattered, he snored in breathing\nas if he had been oppressed by the nightmare, and streams of sweat\nflowed down each side of his forehead.\n\nPeregrine, affecting to start at the approach of such an uncouth figure,\nasked if he had been with a spirit; upon which he answered, with great\nvehemence, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpirit! No, no, master, I have had a roll and tumble with\nthe flesh. A dog. I'll teach him to come a caterwauling about my doors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Guessing from this reply, that his aim was accomplished, and curious to\nknow the particulars of the rencounter, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the youth,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope you have prevailed against the flesh, Tunley.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered the publican, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have cooled his capissens, as the saying is:\nI have played such a tune about his ears, that I'll be bound he shan't\nlong for music this month. A goatish, man-faced rascal! Why, he's a\nperfect parish bull, as I hope to live.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHatchway, observing that he seemed to have made a stout battle, desired\nhe would sit down and recover wind; and after he had swallowed a brace\nof bumpers, his vanity prompted him to expatiate upon his own exploit in\nsuch a manner, that the confederates, without seeming to know the curate\nwas his antagonist, became acquainted with every circumstance of the\nambuscade.\n\nTunley had scarce got the better of his agitation, when his wife,\nentering the room, told them, by way of news, that some waggish body\nhad sent Mr. Sackbut the curate to pray with her. This name inflamed\nthe husband's choler anew; and, forgetting all his complaisance for his\nspouse, he replied with a rancorous grin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdd rabbit him! I doubt not\nbut you found his admonitions deadly comfortable!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The landlady, looking\nat her vassal with a sovereign aspect, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat crotchets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009chave\nyou got in your fool's head, I trow? I know no business you have to sit\nhere like a gentleman with your arms akimbo, there's another company\nin the house to be served.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The submissive husband took the hint, and\nwithout further expostulation sneaked out of the room.\n\nNext day it was reported that Mr. Sackbut had been waylaid and\nalmost murdered by robbers, and an advertisement was pasted upon the\nchurch-door, offering a reward to any person that should discover the\nassassin; but he reaped no satisfaction from this expedient, and\nwas confined to his chamber a whole fortnight, by the bruises he had\nreceived.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\n\n\nMr. Sackbut and his Pupil conspire against Peregrine, who,\nbeing apprised of their Design by his Sister, takes measures for\ncounterworking their Scheme, which is executed by mistake upon Mr.\nGauntlet--this young Soldier meets with a cordial reception from the\nCommodore, who generously decoys him into his own interest.\n\n\nWhen he considered the circumstances of the ambuscade, he could not\npersuade himself that he had been assaulted by a common thief, because\nit was not to be supposed that a robber would have amused himself in\npummeling rather than in rifling his prey; he therefore ascribed his\nmisfortune to the secret enmity of some person who had a design upon his\nlife; and, upon mature deliberation, fixed his suspicion upon Peregrine,\nwho was the only man on earth from whom he thought he deserved such\ntreatment. He communicated his conjecture to his pupil, who readily\nadopted his opinion, and advised him strenuously to revenge the wrong by\na like contrivance, without seeking to make a narrower inquiry, lest his\nenemy should be thereby put upon his guard.\n\nThis proposal being relished, they in concert revolved the means of\nretorting the ambush with interest, and actually laid such a villainous\nplan for attacking our hero in the dark, that, had it been executed\naccording to their intention, the young gentleman's scheme of travelling\nwould have been effectually marred. But their machinations were\noverheard by Miss Pickle, who was now in the seventeenth year of her\nage, and, in spite of the prejudice of education, entertained in secret\na most sisterly affection for her brother Perry, though she had never\nspoken to him, and was deterred by the precepts, vigilance and menaces\nof her mother, from attempting any means of meeting him in private. She\nwas not, however, insensible to his praise, which was loudly sounded\nforth in the neighbourhood; and never failed of going to church, and\nevery other place, where she thought she might have an opportunity of\nseeing this amiable brother. With these sentiments it cannot be supposed\nthat she would hear the conspiracy without emotion. She was shocked at\nthe treacherous barbarity of Gam, and shuddered at the prospect of the\ndanger to which Peregrine would be exposed from their malice. She durst\nnot communicate this plot to her mother, because she was afraid that\nlady's unaccountable aversion for her first-born would hinder her\nfrom interposing in his behalf, and consequently render her a sort of\naccomplice in the guilt of his assassins. She therefore resolved to warn\nPeregrine of the conspiracy, on account of which she transmitted to\nhim in an affectionate letter, by means of a young gentleman in that\nneighbourhood, who made his addresses to her at that time, and who, at\nher request, offered his service to our hero, in defeating the projects\nof his adversaries.\n\nPeregrine was startled when he read the particulars of their scheme,\nwhich was no other than an intention to sally upon him when he should\nbe altogether unprovided against such an attack, cut off his ears, and\notherwise mutilate him in such a manner that he should have no cause\nto be vain of his person for the future. Incensed as he was against\nthe brutal disposition of his own father's son, he could not help\nbeing moved at the integrity and tenderness of his sister, of whose\ninclinations towards him he had been hitherto kept in ignorance. He\nthanked the gentleman for his honourable dealing, and expressed a desire\nof being better acquainted with his virtues; told him that now he was\ncautioned, he hoped there would be no necessity for giving him any\nfurther trouble, and wrote by him a letter of acknowledgment to his\nsister, for whom he expressed the utmost love and regard, beseeching\nher to favour him with an interview before his departure, that he might\nindulge his fraternal fondness, and be blessed with the company and\ncountenance of one at least belonging to his own family. Having imparted\nthis discovery to his friend Hatchway, they came to a resolution of\ncountermining the plan of their enemies. As they did not choose to\nexpose themselves to the insinuations of slander, which would have\nexerted itself at their expense, had they, even in defending themselves,\nemployed any harsh means of retaliation, they invented a method of\ndisappointing and disgracing their foes, and immediately set Pipes at\nwork to forward the preparations. Miss Pickle having described the spot\nwhich the assassins had pitched upon for the scene of their vengeance,\nour triumvirate intended to have placed a sentinel among the corn, who\nshould come and give them intelligence when the ambuscade was laid; and,\nin consequence of that information, they would steal softly towards the\nplace, attended by three or four of the domestics, and draw a large\nnet over the conspirators, who, being entangled in the toil, should be\ndisarmed, fettered, heartily scourged, and suspended between two trees\nin the snare, as a spectacle to all passengers that should chance to\ntravel that way.\n\nThe plan being thus digested, and the commodore acquainted with the\nwhole affair, the spy was sent upon duty, and everybody within-doors\nprepared to go forth upon the first notice. One whole evening did they\nspend in the most impatient expectation, but on the second the scout\ncrept into the garrison, and assured them that he had perceived three\nmen skulking behind the hedge, on the road that led to the public-house\nfrom which Peregrine and the lieutenant used every night to return about\nthat hour. Upon this intelligence the confederates set out immediately\nwith all their implements. Approaching the scene with as little noise as\npossible, they heard the sound of blows; and, though the night was\ndark, perceived a sort of tumultuous conflict on the very spot which the\nconspirators had possessed. Surprised at this occurrence, the meaning of\nwhich he could not comprehend, Peregrine ordered his myrmidons to\nhalt and reconnoitre; and immediately his ears were saluted with an\nexclamation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shan't 'scape me, rascal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The voice being quite\nfamiliar to him, he at once divined the cause of that confusion which\nthey had observed; and running up to the assistance of the exclaimer,\nfound a fellow on his knees begging his life of Mr. Gauntlet, who stood\nover him with a naked hanger in his hand.\n\nPickle instantly made himself known to his friend, who told him, that\nhaving left his horse at Tunley's, he was, in his way to the garrison,\nset upon by three ruffians, one of whom being the very individual person\nnow in his power, had come behind him, and struck with a bludgeon at\nhis head, which, however, he missed, and the instrument descended on his\nleft shoulder; that, upon drawing his hanger, and laying about him\nin the dark, the other two fled, leaving their companion, whom he had\ndisabled, in the lurch.\n\nPeregrine congratulated him on his safety, and having ordered Pipes to\nsecure the prisoner, conducted Mr. Gauntlet to the garrison, where he\nmet with a very hearty reception from the commodore, to whom he was\nintroduced as his nephew's intimate friend; not but that, in all\nlikelihood, he would have abated somewhat of his hospitality had he\nknown that he was the brother of Perry's mistress; but her name the\nold gentleman had never thought of asking, when he inquired into the\nparticulars of his godson's amour.\n\nThe captive being examined, in presence of Trunnion and all his\nadherents, touching the ambuscade, owned that being in the service of\nGam Pickle, he had been prevailed upon, by the solicitations of his\nmaster and the Curate, to accompany them in their expedition, and\nundertake the part which he had acted against the stranger, whom he\nand his employers mistook for Peregrine. In consideration of this frank\nacknowledgment, and a severe wound he had received in his right arm,\nthey resolved to inflict no other punishment on this malefactor than to\ndetain him all night in the garrison, and next morning carry him before\na justice of the peace, to whom he repeated all he had said overnight,\nand with his own hand subscribed his confession, copies of which\nwere handed about the neighbourhood, to the unspeakable confusion and\ndisgrace of the curate and his promising pupil.\n\nMeanwhile Trunnion treated the young soldier with uncommon marks of\nrespect, being prepossessed in his favour by this adventure, which he\nhad so gallantly achieved, as well as by the encomiums that Peregrine\nbestowed upon his valour and generosity. He liked his countenance, which\nwas bold and hardy, admired his Herculean limbs, and delighted in asking\nquestions concerning the service he had seen. The day after his arrival,\nwhile the conversation turned on this last subject, the commodore,\ntaking the pipe out of his month, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll tell ye what, brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cfive-and-forty years ago, when I was third lieutenant of the Warwick\nman-of-war, there was a very stout young fellow on board, a subaltern\nofficer of marines; his name was not unlike your own, d'ye see, being\nGuntlet, with a G. I remember he and I could not abide one another at\nfirst, because, d'ye see, I was a sailor and he a landsman; till we fell\nin with a Frenchman, whom we engaged for eight glasses, and at length\nboarded and took. I was the first man that stood on the enemy's deck,\nand should have come scurvily off, d'ye see, if Guntlet had not jumped\nto my assistance; but we soon cleared ship, and drove them to close\nquarters, so that they were obliged to strike; and from that day Guntlet\nand I were sworn brothers as long as he remained on board. He was\nexchanged into a marching regiment, and what became of him afterwards,\nLord in heaven knows; but this I'll say of him, whether he be dead or\nalive, he feared no man that ever wore a head, and was, moreover, a very\nhearty messmate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe stranger's breast glowed at this eulogium, which was no sooner\npronounced than he eagerly asked if the French ship was not the\nDiligence? The commodore replied, with a stare, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe very same, my\nlad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gauntlet, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe person of whom you are pleased to\nmake such honourable mention was my own father.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe devil he was!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n cried Trunnion, shaking him by the hand: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am rejoiced to see a son of\nNed Guntlet in my house.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis discovery introduced a thousand questions, in the course of which\nthe old gentleman learned the situation of his friend's family, and\ndischarged innumerable execrations upon the ingratitude and injustice\nof the ministry, which had failed to provide for the son of such a\nbrave soldier. Nor was his friendship confined to such ineffectual\nexpressions; he that same evening signified to Peregrine a desire of\ndoing something for his friend. This inclination was so much praised,\nencouraged, and promoted by his godson, and even supported by his\ncouncilor Hatchway, that our hero was empowered to present him with a\nsum of money sufficient to purchase a commission.\n\nThough nothing could be more agreeable to Pickle than this permission,\nhe was afraid that Godfrey's scrupulous disposition would hinder him\nfrom subjecting himself to any such obligation; and therefore proposed\nthat he should be decoyed into his own interest by a feigned story, in\nconsequence of which he would be prevailed upon to accept of the money,\nas a debt which the commodore had contracted of his father at sea.\nTrunnion made wry faces at this expedient, the necessity of which he\ncould not conceive, without calling in question the common sense of\nGauntlet; as he took it for granted that such offers as those were not\nto be rejected on any consideration whatever. Besides, he could not\ndigest an artifice, by which he himself must own that he had lived so\nmany years without manifesting the least intention of doing justice to\nhis creditor. All these objections, however, were removed by the zeal\nand rhetoric of Peregrine, who represented that it would be impossible\nto befriend him on any other terms; that his silence hitherto would\nbe imputed to his want of information touching the circumstances and\ncondition of his friend; and that his remembering and insisting upon\ndischarging the obligation, after such an interval of time, when the\nwhole affair was in oblivion, would be the greatest compliment he could\npay to his own honour and integrity.\n\nThus persuaded, he took an opportunity of Gauntlet's being alone with\nhim to broach the affair, telling the young man that his father had\nadvanced a sum of money for him, when they sailed together, on account\nof the mess, as well as to stop the mouth of a clamorous creditor at\nPortsmouth; and that the said sum, with interest, amounted to about four\nhundred pounds, which he would now, with great thankfulness, repay.\n\nGodfrey was amazed at this declaration, and, after a considerable pause,\nreplied, that he had never heard his parents mention any such debt; that\nno memorandum or voucher of it was found among his father's papers;\nand that, in all probability, it must have been discharged long ago,\nalthough the commodore, in such a long course of time and hurry of\noccupation, might have forgotten the repayment: he therefore desired to\nbe excused from accepting what in his own conscience he believed was\nnot his due; and complemented the old gentleman upon his being so\nscrupulously just and honourable.\n\nThe soldier's refusal, which was matter of astonishment to Trunnion,\nincreased his inclination to assist him; and, on pretence of acquitting\nhis own character, he urged his beneficence with such obstinacy, that\nGauntlet, afraid of disobliging him, was in a manner compelled to\nreceive a draft for the money; for which he subscribed an ample\ndischarge, and immediately transmitted the order to his mother, whom\nat the same time he informed of the circumstances by which they had so\nunexpectedly gained this accession of fortune.\n\nSuch a piece of news could not fail of being agreeable to Mrs. Gauntlet,\nwho by the first post wrote a polite letter of acknowledgment to the\ncommodore; another to her own son, importing that she had already sent\nthe draft to a friend in London, with directions to deposit it in the\nhands of a certain banker, for the purchase of the first ensigncy to be\nsold; and she took the liberty of sending a third to Peregrine, couched\nin very affectionate terms, with a kind postscript, signed by Miss Sophy\nand his charming Emily.\n\nThis affair being transacted to the satisfaction of all concerned,\npreparations were set on foot for the departure of our hero, on whom his\nuncle settled an annuity of eight hundred pounds, being little less than\none half of his whole income. By this time, indeed, the old gentleman\ncould easily afford to alienate such a part of his fortune, because he\nentertained little or no company, kept few servants, and was remarkably\nplain and frugal in his housekeeping. Mrs. Trunnion being now some\nyears on the wrong side of fifty, her infirmities began to increase; and\nthough her pride had suffered no diminution, her vanity was altogether\nsubdued by her avarice.\n\nA Swiss valet-de-chambre, who had already made the tour of Europe, was\nhired for the care of Peregrine's own person. Pipes being ignorant of\nthe French language, as well as otherwise unfit for the office of\na fashionable attendant, it was resolved that he should remain in\ngarrison; and his place was immediately supplied by a Parisian lacquey\nengaged at London for that purpose. Pipes did not seem to relish this\ndisposition of things; and though he made no verbal objections to it,\nlooked remarkably sour at his successor upon his first arrival; but this\nsullen fit seemed gradually to wear off; and long before his master's\ndeparture, he had recovered his natural tranquility and unconcern.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\n\n\nThe two young Gentlemen display their talents for Gallantry, in the\ncourse of which they are involved in a ludicrous circumstance of\nDistress, and afterwards take Vengeance on the Author of their Mishap.\n\n\nMeanwhile our hero and his new friend, together with honest Jack\nHatchway, made daily excursions into the country, visited the gentlemen\nin the neighbourhood, and frequently accompanied them to the chase;\nall three being exceedingly caressed on account of their talents, which\ncould accommodate themselves with great facility to the tempers and\nturns of their entertainers. The lieutenant was a droll in his way,\nPeregrine possessed a great fund of sprightliness and good-humour, and\nGodfrey, among his other qualifications already recited, sang a most\nexcellent song; so that the company of this triumvirate was courted\nin all parties, whether male or female: and if the hearts of our\nyoung gentlemen had not been pre-engaged, they would have met with\nopportunities in abundance of displaying their address in the art of\nlove: not but that they gave loose to their gallantry without much\ninteresting their affections, and amused themselves with little\nintrigues, which, in the opinion of a man of pleasure, do not affect his\nfidelity to the acknowledged sovereign of his soul.\n\nIn the midst of these amusements, our hero received an intimation from\nhis sister, that she should be overjoyed to meet him next day, at five\no'clock in the afternoon, at the house of her nurse, who lived in a\ncottage hard by her father's habitation, she being debarred from all\nopportunity of seeing him in any other place by the severity of her\nmother, who suspected her inclination. He accordingly obeyed the\nsummons, and went at the time appointed to the place of rendezvous,\nwhere he met this affectionate young lady, who when he entered the room,\nran towards him with all the eagerness of transport, flung her arms\nabout his neck, and shed a flood of tears in his bosom before she\ncould utter one word, except a repetition of My dear, dear brother! He\nembraced her with all the piety of fraternal tenderness, wept over her\nin his turn, assured her that this was one of the happiest moments of\nhis life, and kindly thanked her for having resisted the example, and\ndisobeyed the injunctions, of his mother's unnatural aversion.\n\nHe was ravished to find, by her conversation, that she possessed a\ngreat share of sensibility and prudent reflection; for she lamented the\ninfatuation of her parents with the most filial regret, and expressed\nsuch abhorrence and concern at the villainous disposition of her younger\nbrother as a humane sister may be supposed to have entertained. He made\nher acquainted with all the circumstances of his own fortune; and, as he\nsupposed she spent her time very disagreeably at home, among characters\nwhich must be shockingly interesting, professed a desire of removing her\ninto some other sphere, where she could live with more tranquility and\nsatisfaction.\n\nShe objected to this proposal as an expedient that would infallibly\nsubject her to the implacable resentment of her mother, whose favour and\naffection she at present enjoyed but in a very inconsiderable degree;\nand they had canvassed divers schemes of corresponding for the future,\nwhen the voice of Mrs. Pickle was heard at the door. Miss Julia (that\nwas the young lady's name), finding herself betrayed, was seized with\na violent agitation of fear; and Peregrine scarce had time to encourage\nher with a promise of protection, before the door of the apartment being\nflung open, this irreconcilable parent rushed in, and, with a furious\naspect, flew directly at her trembling daughter, when, the son\ninterposing, received the first discharge of her fury.\n\nHer eyes gleamed with all the rage of indignation, which choked up her\nutterance, and seemed to convulse her whole frame: she twisted her left\nhand in his hair, and with the other buffeted him about the face till\nthe blood gushed from his nostrils and mouth; while he defended his\nsister from the cruelty of Gam, who assaulted her from another quarter,\nseeing his brother engaged. This attack lasted several minutes with\ngreat violence, till at length Peregrine, finding himself in danger of\nbeing overpowered if he should remain any longer on the defensive, laid\nhis brother on his back; then he disentangled his mother's hand from his\nown hair, and, having pushed her gently out of the room, bolted the door\non the inside; finally, turning to Gam, he threw him out at the window,\namong a parcel of hogs that fed under it. By this time Julia was almost\nquite distracted with terror: she knew she had offended beyond all hope\nof forgiveness, and from that moment considered herself as an exile from\nher father's house: in vain did her brother strive to console her\nwith fresh protestations of love and protection; she counted herself\nextremely miserable in being obliged to endure the eternal resentment\nof a parent with whom she had hitherto lived; and dreaded the censure of\nthe world, which, from her mother's misrepresentation, she was sensible\nwould condemn her unheard. That she might not, however, neglect any\nmeans in her power of averting this storm, she resolved to appease, if\npossible, her mother's wrath with humiliation, and even appeal to the\ninfluence of her father, weak as it was, before she would despair\nof being forgiven. But the good lady spared her this unnecessary\napplication, by telling her, through the keyhole, that she must never\nexpect to come within her father's door again; for, from that hour, she\nrenounced her as unworthy of her affection and regard. Julia, weeping\nbitterly, endeavoured to soften the rigour of this sentence by the most\nsubmissive and reasonable remonstrances; but as, in her vindication, she\nof necessity espoused her elder brother's cause, her endeavours, instead\nof soothing, served only to exasperate her mother to a higher pitch of\nindignation, which discharged itself in invectives against Peregrine,\nwhom she reviled with the epithets of a worthless, abandoned reprobate.\n\nThe youth, hearing these unjust aspersions, trembled with resentment\nthrough every limb, assuring the upbraider that he considered her as an\nobject of compassion; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor without all doubt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour diabolical\nrancour must be severely punished by the thorns of your own conscience,\nwhich this very instant taxes you with the malice and falsehood of your\nreproaches. As for my sister, I bless God that you have not been able\nto infect her with your unnatural prejudice, which, because she is too\njust, too virtuous, too humane to imbibe, you reject her as an alien to\nyour blood, and turn her out unprovided into a barbarous world. But even\nthere your vicious purpose shall be defeated: that same Providence, that\nscreened me from the cruelty of your hate, shall extend its protection\nto her, until I shall find it convenient to assert by law that right of\nmaintenance which Nature, it seems, hath bestowed upon us in vain. In\nthe mean time, you will enjoy the satisfaction of paying an undivided\nattention to that darling son, whose amiable qualities have so long\nengaged and engrossed your love and esteem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis freedom of expostulation exalted his mother's ire to mere frenzy:\nshe cursed him with the bitterest imprecations, and raved like a\nbedlamite at the door, which she attempted to burst open. Her efforts\nwere seconded by her favourite son, who denounced vengeance against\nPeregrine, and made furious assaults against the lock, which resisted\nall their applications, until our hero espying his friends Gauntlet and\nPipes stepping over a stile that stood about a furlong from the window,\ncalled them to his assistance: giving them to understand how he was\nbesieged, he desired they would keep off his mother, that he might the\nmore easily secure his sister Julia's retreat. The young soldier entered\naccordingly, and, posting, himself between Mrs. Pickle and the door,\ngave the signal to his friend, who, lifting up his sister in his arms,\ncarried her safe without the clutches of this she-dragon, while Pipes,\nwith his cudgel, kept young master at bay.\n\nThe mother, being thus deprived of her prey, sprang upon Gauntlet like\na lioness robbed of her whelps; and he must have suffered sorely in the\nflesh, had he not prevented her mischievous intent by seizing both her\nwrists, and so keeping her at due distance. In attempting to disengage\nherself from his grasp, she struggled with such exertion, and suffered\nsuch agony of passion at the same time, that she actually fell into\na severe fit, during which she was put to bed, and the confederates\nretired without further molestation.\n\nIn the mean time, Peregrine was not a little perplexed about the\ndisposal of his sister, whom he had rescued. He could not endure the\nthoughts of saddling the commodore with a new expense; and he was afraid\nof undertaking the charge of Julia, without his benefactor's advice and\ndirection: for the present, however, he carried her to the house of a\ngentleman in the neighbourhood, whose lady was her godmother, where she\nwas received with great tenderness and condolence; and he purposed to\ninquire for some creditable house, where she might be genteelly boarded\nin his absence; resolving to maintain her from the savings of his own\nallowance, which he thought might very well bear such reduction. But\nthis intention was frustrated by the publication of the whole affair,\nwhich was divulged next day, and soon reached the ears of Trunnion,\nwho chid his godson for having concealed the adventure; and, with the\napprobation of his wife, ordered him to bring Julia forthwith to the\ngarrison. The young gentleman, with tears of gratitude in his eyes,\nexplained his design of maintaining her at his own expense, and\nearnestly begged that he might not be deprived of that satisfaction. But\nhis uncle was deaf to all his entreaties, and insisted upon her living\nin the garrison, though for no other reason than that of being company\nto her aunt, who, he observed, was lost for want of conversation.\n\nJulia was accordingly brought home, and settled under the tuition of\nMrs. Trunnion, who, whatever face she might put on the matter, could\nhave dispensed with the society of her niece, though she was not without\nhope of gratifying her pique to Mrs. Pickle, by the intelligence she\nwould receive from the daughter of that lady's economy and domestic\nbehaviour. The mother herself seemed conscious of this advantage which\nher sister-in-law had now gained over her, being as much chagrined at\nthe news of Julia's reception in the garrison, as if she had heard of\nher own husband's death. She even tortured her invention to propagate\ncalumnies against the reputation of her own daughter, whom she slandered\nin all companies; she exclaimed against the commodore as an old\nruffian, who spirited up rebellion among her children, and imputed the\nhospitality of his wife, in countenancing them, to nothing else but her\ninveterate enmity to their mother, whom they had disobliged. She now\ninsisted, in the most peremptory terms, upon her husband's renouncing\nall commerce with the old lad of the castle and his adherents; and Mr.\nGamaliel, having by this time contracted other friendships, readily\nsubmitted to her will; nay, even refused to communicate with the\ncommodore one night, when they happened to meet by accident at the\npublic-house.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\n\n\nThe Commodore sends a Challenge to Gamaliel, and is imposed upon by a\nwaggish invention of the Lieutenant, Peregrine, and Gauntlet.\n\n\nThis affront Trunnion could by no means digest: he advised with the\nlieutenant upon the subject; and the result of their consultation was a\ndefiance which the old commander sent to Pickle, demanding that he would\nmeet him at such a place on horseback with a brace of pistols, and give\nsatisfaction for the slight he had put upon him. Nothing could have\nafforded more pleasure to Jack than the acceptance of this challenge,\nwhich he delivered verbally to Mr. Gamaliel, who was called out from\nthe club at Tunley's for that purpose. The nature of this message had an\ninstantaneous effect upon the constitution of the pacific Pickle, whose\nbowels yearned with apprehension, and underwent such violent agitation\non the spot, that one would have thought the operation proceeded from\nsome severe joke of the apothecary which he had swallowed in his beer.\n\nThe messenger, despairing of a satisfactory answer, left him in this\nwoeful condition; and being loath to lose any opportunity of raising the\nlaugh against the commodore, went immediately and communicated the whole\naffair to the young gentlemen, entreating them, for the love of God,\nto concert some means of bringing old Hannibal into the field. The\ntwo friends relished the proposal; and after some deliberation, it was\nresolved that Hatchway should tell Trunnion his invitation was accepted\nby Gamaliel, who would meet him at the place appointed, with his second,\nto-morrow in the twilight, because, if either should fall, the other\nwould have the chance of escaping in the dark; that Godfrey should\npersonate old Pickle's friend, and Peregrine represent his own father;\nwhile the lieutenant should take care in loading the pistols to keep out\nthe shot, so that no damage might be done in the rencounter.\n\nThese circumstances being adjusted, the lieutenant returned to his\nprincipal with a most thundering reply from his antagonist, whose\ncourageous behaviour, though it could not intimidate, did not fail to\nastonish the commodore, who ascribed it to the spirit of his wife,\nwhich had inspired him. Trunnion that instant desired his counsellor to\nprepare his cartridge-box, and order the quietest horse in the stable to\nbe kept ready saddled for the occasion; his eye seemed to lighten with\nalacrity and pleasure at the prospect of smelling gunpowder once more\nbefore his death; and when Jack advised him to make his will, in case of\naccident, he rejected his counsel with disdain, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! dost thou\nthink that Hawser Trunnion, who has stood the fire of so many floating\nbatteries, runs any risk from the lousy pops of a landman? Thou shalt\nsee, thou shalt see, how I'll make him lower his topsails.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNext day Peregrine and the soldier provided themselves with horses at\nthe public-house, from whence, at the destined hour, they rode to the\nfield of battle, each of them being muffed in a great coat, which, with\nthe dimness of the light, effectually shielded them from the knowledge\nof the one-eyed commander, who, having taken horse, on pretence of\nenjoying the fresh air, soon appeared with Hatchway in his rear. When\nthey came within sight of each other, the seconds advanced, in order to\ndivide the ground, and regulate the measures of the combat; when it was\ndetermined by mutual consent, that two pistols should be discharged on\neach side, and that if neither should prove decisive, recourse must\nbe had to the broad-swords, in order to ascertain the victory. These\narticles being settled, the opponents rode forward to their respective\nstations, when Peregrine, cocking his pistol, and presenting,\ncounterfeited his father's voice, bidding Trunnion take care of his\nremaining eye.\n\nThe commodore took his advice, being unwilling to hazard his daylight,\nand very deliberately opposed the patched side of his face to the muzzle\nof his antagonist's piece, desiring him to do his duty without farther\njaw. The young man accordingly fired; and the distance being small,\nthe wad of his pistol took place with a smart stroke on the forehead of\nTrunnion. Mistaking it for a ball, which he thought lodged in his brain,\nspurred up his steed in a state of desperation towards his antagonist,\nand holding his piece within two yards of his body, let it off, without\nany regard to the laws of battle. Surprised and enraged to see it had\nmade no impression, he halloed, in a terrible tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cO! d-ye, you have\nyour netting stuffed, I see;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and advancing, he discharged his second\npistol so near his godson's head, that had he not been defended by his\ngreat coat, the powder must have scorched his face. Having thus thrown\naway his fire, he remained at the mercy of Peregrine, who clapping the\npiece he had in reserve to his head, commanded him to beg his life,\nand ask pardon for his presumption. The commodore made no reply to this\nimperious injunction; but, dropping his pistol, and unsheathing his\nbroad-sword in an instant, attacked our hero with such incredible\nagility, that if he had not made shift to ward off the stroke with his\npiece, the adventure, in all likelihood, would have turned out a very\ntragical joke.\n\nPeregrine finding it would be in vain for him to think of drawing his\nweapon, or of standing on the defensive against this furious aggressor,\nvery fairly clapped spurs to his nag, and sought his safety in flight.\nTrunnion pursued him with infinite eagerness; and his steed being the\nbetter of the two, would have overtaken the fugitive to his peril, had\nhe not been unfortunately encountered by the boughs of a tree, that\nhappened to stand on his blind side, and incommoded him so much, that\nhe was fain to quit his sword, and lay hold on the mane in order to\nmaintain his seat. Perry perceiving his disaster, wheeled about, and now\nfinding leisure to produce his weapon, returned upon his disarmed foe,\nbrandishing his Ferrara, threatening to make him shorter by the head\nif he would not immediately crave quarter and yield. There was nothing\nfarther from the intention of the old gentleman than such submission,\nwhich he flatly refused to pay, alleging that he had already compelled\nhis enemy to clap on all sails, and that his own present misfortune was\nowing to accident; all one as if a ship should be attacked, after she\nhad been obliged to heave her guns overboard in a storm.\n\nBefore Peregrine had time to answer this remonstrance, the lieutenant\ninterposed, and taking cognizance of the case, established a truce,\nuntil he and the other second should discuss and decide upon the merits\nof the case. They accordingly retired to a small distance; and after\nhaving conferred a few minutes, Hatchway returned and pronounced the\ncommodore vanquished by the chance of war.\n\nNever was rage more than that which took possession of old Hannibal,\nwhen he heard the sentence: it was some time before he could utter\naught, except the reproachful expression, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou lie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d which he repeated\nmore than twenty times, in a sort of delirious insensibility. When he\nrecovered the further use of speech, he abused the arbitrators with such\nbitter invectives, renouncing their sentence, and appealing to another\ntrial, that the confederates began to repent of having carried the joke\nso far; and Peregrine, in order to appease his choler, owned himself\novercome.\n\nThis acknowledgment calmed the tumult of his wrath, though he could not\nfor some days forgive the lieutenant; and the two young gentlemen rode\nback to Tunley's, while Hatchway, taking the commodore's horse by the\nbridle, reconducted him to his mansion, growling all the way to Jack for\nhis unjust and unfriendly decree; though he could not help observing,\nas how he had made his words good, in making his adversary to strike his\ntop-sails: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbefore God! I think the fellow's head is\nmade of a wood-pack: for my shot rebounded from his face like a wad of\nspun-yarn from the walls of a ship. But if so be that son of a b-- of\na tree hadn't come athwart my weather-bow, d'ye see, I'll be d--d if\nI hadn't snapt his main-yard in the slings, and mayhap let out his\nbulge-water into the bargain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He seemed particularly vain of this\nexploit, which dwelt upon his imagination, and was cherished as the\nchild of his old age; for though he could not with decency rehearse\nit to the young men and his wife at supper, he gave hints of his own\nmanhood, even at these years, and attested Hatchway as a voucher for his\nmettle; while the triumvirate, diverted by his vanity, enjoyed in secret\nthe success of their imposition.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\n\n\nPeregrine takes leave of his Aunt and Sister--Sets out from the\nGarrison-Parts with his Uncle and Hatchway on the Road, and with his\nGovernor arrives in safety at Dover.\n\n\nThis, however, was the last effort of invention which they practised\nupon him; and everything being now prepared for the departure of his\ngodson, that hopeful youth in two days took leave of all his friends in\nthe neighbourhood. He was closeted two whole hours with his aunt, who\nenriched him with many pious advices, recapitulated all the benefits\nwhich, through her means, had been conferred upon him since his infancy,\ncautioned him against the temptations of lewd women, who bring many a\nman to a morsel of bread, laid strict injunctions upon him to live in\nthe fear of the Lord and the true Protestant faith, to eschew quarrels\nand contention, to treat Mr. Jolter with reverence and regard, and above\nall things to abstain from the beastly sin of drunkenness, which\nexposes a man to the scorn and contempt of his fellow-creatures, and, by\ndivesting him of reason and reflection, renders him fit for all manner\nof vice and debauchery. She recommended to him economy, and the care of\nhis health, bade him remember the honour of his family, and in all the\ncircumstances of his behaviour, assured him that he might always depend\nupon the friendship and generosity of the commodore. Finally, presenting\nhim with her own picture set in gold, and a hundred guineas from her\nprivy purse, she embraced him affectionately, and wished him all manner\nof happiness and prosperity.\n\nBeing thus kindly dismissed by Mrs. Trunnion, he locked himself up with\nhis sister Julia, whom he admonished to cultivate her aunt with the\nmost complaisant and respectful attention, without stooping to any\ncircumstance of submission that she should judge unworthy of her\npractice: he protested that his chief study should be to make her amends\nfor the privilege she had forfeited by her affection for him; entreated\nher to enter into no engagement without his knowledge and approbation;\nput into her hand the purse, which he had received from his aunt, to\ndefray her pocket expenses in his absence; and parted from her, not\nwithout tears, after she had for some minutes hung about his neck,\nkissing him, and weeping in the most pathetic silence.\n\nHaving performed these duties of affection and consanguinity over-night,\nhe went to bed, and was, by his own direction, called at four o'clock\nin the morning, when he found the post-chaise, coach, and riding-horses\nready at the gate, his friends Gauntlet and Hatchway on foot, the\ncommodore himself almost dressed, and every servant in the garrison\nassembled in he yard to wish him a good journey. Our hero shook each\nof these humble friends by the hand, tipping them at the same time\nwith marks of his bounty; and was very much surprised when he could not\nperceive his old attendant Pipes among the number. When he expressed his\nwonder at this disrespectful omission of Tom, some of those present ran\nto his chamber, in order to give him a call; but his hammock and room\nwere both deserted, and they soon returned with an account of his having\neloped. Peregrine was disturbed at this information, believing that\nthe fellow had taken some desperate course, in consequence of his being\ndismissed from his service, and began to wish that he had indulged his\ninclination, by retaining him still about his person. However, as\nthere was now no other remedy, he recommended him strenuously to the\nparticular favour and distinction of his uncle and Hatchway, in case he\nshould appear again; and as he went out of the gate, was saluted with\nthree cheers by all the domestics in the family.\n\nThe commodore, Gauntlet, lieutenant, Peregrine, and Jolter went into the\ncoach together, that they might enjoy each other's conversation as\nmuch as possible, resolving to breakfast at an inn upon the road, where\nTrunnion and Hatchway intended to bid our adventurer farewell; the\nValet-de-chambre got into the post-chaise; the French lacquey rode one\nhorse, and led another; one of the valets of the garrison mounted at the\nback of the coach; and thus the cavalcade set out on the road to Dover.\n\nAs the commodore could not bear the fatigue of jolting, they travelled\nat an easy pace during the first stage; so that the old gentleman had an\nopportunity of communicating his exhortations to his godson, with\nregard to his conduct abroad: he advised him, now that he was going\ninto foreign parts, to be upon his guard against the fair weather of the\nFrench politesse, which was no more to be trusted than a whirlpool at\nsea. He observed that many young men had gone to Paris with good cargoes\nof sense, and returned with a great deal of canvas, and no ballast\nat all, whereby they became crank all the days of their lives, and\nsometimes carried their keels above water. He desired Mr. Jolter to keep\nhis pupil out of the clutches of those sharking priests who lie in wait\nto make converts of all young strangers, and in a particular manner\ncautioned the youth against carnal conversation with the Parisian dames,\nwho, he understood, were no better than gaudy fire-ships ready primed\nwith death and destruction.\n\nPeregrine listened with great respect, thanking him for his kind\nadmonitions, which he faithfully promised to observe. The halted and\nbreakfasted at the end of the stage, where Jolter provided himself with\na horse, and the commodore settled the method of corresponding with his\nnephew. The minute of parting being arrived, the old commander wrung his\ngodson by the hand, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish thee a prosperous voyage and good\ncheer, my lad: my timbers are now a little crazy, d'ye see; and God\nknows if I shall keep afloat till such time as I see thee again; but\nhowsomever, hap what will, thou wilt find thyself in a condition to keep\nin the line with the rest of thy fellows.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He then reminded Gauntlet\nof his promise to call at the garrison in his return from Dover, and\nimparted something in a whisper to the governor, while Jack Hatchway,\nunable to speak, pulled his hat over his eyes, and, squeezing Peregrine\nby the hand, gave him a pistol of curious workmanship, as a memorial\nof his friendship. Our youth, who was not unmoved on this occasion,\nreceived the pledge, which he acknowledged with the present of a\ntobacco-box bought for this purpose; and the two lads of the castle\ngetting into the coach, were driven homewards, in a state of silent\ndejection.\n\nGodfrey and Peregrine seated themselves in the post-chaise; and Jolter,\nthe valet-de-chambre, and lacquey, bestriding their beasts, they\nproceeded for the place of their destination, at which they arrived in\nsafety that same night, and bespoke a passage in the packet-boat which\nwas to sail next day.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\n\n\nHe adjusts the Method of his Correspondence with Gauntlet; meets by\naccident with an Italian Charlatan, and a certain Apothecary, who proves\nto be a noted Character.\n\n\nThere the two friends adjusted the articles of a future correspondence;\nand Peregrine, having written a letter to his mistress, wherein he\nrenewed his former vows of eternal fidelity, it was intrusted to the\ncare of her brother, while Mr. Jolter, at the desire of his pupil,\nprovided an elegant supper, and some excellent Burgundy, that they might\nspend this eve of his departure with the greater enjoyment.\n\nThings being thus disposed, and a servant employed in laying the cloth,\ntheir ears were of a sudden invaded by a strange tumultuous noise in the\nnext room, occasioned by the overthrow of tables, chairs, and glasses,\nwith odd unintelligible exclamations in broken French, and a jargon of\nthreats in the Welsh dialect. Our young gentlemen ran immediately into\nthe apartment from whence this clamour seemed to proceed, and found a\nthin, meagre, swarthy figure, gasping, in all the agony of fear, under\nthe hands of a squat, thick, hard-featured man, who collared him with\ngreat demonstrations of wrath, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you was as mighty a magician\nas Owen Glendower or the witch of Entor, look you, ay, ay, or as Paul\nBeor himself, I will meke pold, by the assistance of Got, and in his\nmajesty's name, to seize and secure, and confine and confront you, until\nsuch time as you suffer and endure and undergo the pains and penalties\nof the law, for your diabolical practices. Shentlements,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added he,\nturning to our adventurers, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI take you to witness, that I protest, and\nassert, and avow, that this person is as pig a necromancer as you would\ndesire to behold; and I supplicate, and beseech, and entreat of you,\nthat he may be prought pefore his petters, and compelled to give an\naccount of his compact and commerce with the imps of darkness, look you;\nfor, as I am a Christian soul, and hope for joyful resurrection, I have\nthis plessed evening seen him perform such things as could not be done\nwithout the aid and instruction and connivance of the tevil.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGauntlet seemed to enter into the sentiments of this Welsh reformer,\nand actually laid hold on the delinquent's shoulder, crying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--n the\nrascal! I'll lay any wager that he's a Jesuit; for none of his order\ntravel without a familiar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Peregrine, who looked upon the affair\nin another point of view, interposed in behalf of the stranger, whom he\nfreed from his aggressors, observing, that there was no occasion to use\nviolence; and asked, in French, what he had done to incur the censure of\nthe informer. The poor foreigner, more dead than alive, answered that\nhe was an Italian charlatan, who had practised with some reputation\nin Padua, until he had the misfortune to attract the notice of the\nInquisition, by exhibiting certain wonderful performances by his skill\nin natural knowledge, which that tribunal considered as the effects of\nsorcery, and persecuted him accordingly; so that he had been fain to\nmake a precipitate retreat into France, where not finding his account\nin his talents, he was now arrived in England, with a view of practising\nhis art in London; and that, in consequence of a specimen which he\nhad given to a company below, the choleric gentleman had followed him\nup-stairs to his own apartment, and assaulted him in that inhospitable\nmanner: he therefore earnestly begged that our hero would take him\nunder his protection; and, if he entertained the least suspicion of his\nemploying preternatural means in the operations of his art, he would\nfreely communicate all the secrets in his possession.\n\nThe youth dispelled his apprehension by assuring him that he was in no\ndanger of suffering for his art in England, where, if ever he should be\nquestioned by the zeal of superstitious individuals, he had nothing to\ndo but appeal to the justice of the peace, who would immediately acquit\nhim of the charge, and punish his accusers for their impertinence and\nindiscretion.\n\nHe then told Gauntlet and the Welshman that the stranger had a good\naction against them for an assault, by virtue of an Act of Parliament,\nwhich makes it criminal for any person to accuse another of sorcery and\nwitchcraft, these idle notions being now justly exploded by all sensible\nmen. Mr. Jolter, who had by this time joined the company, could not\nhelp signifying his dissent from this opinion of his pupil, which he\nendeavoured to invalidate by the authority of Scripture, quotations from\nthe Fathers, and the confession of many wretches who suffered death for\nhaving carried on correspondence with evil spirits together with\nthe evidence of \u00e2\u0080\u009cSatan's Invisible World,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Moreton's \u00e2\u0080\u009cHistory of\nWitchcraft.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe soldier corroborated these testimonies by facts that had happened\nwithin the sphere of his own knowledge, and in particular mentioned the\ncase of an old woman of the parish in which he was born, who used to\ntransform herself into the shapes of sundry animals, and was at last\nkilled by small shot in the character of a hare. The Welshman, thus\nsupported, expressed his surprise at hearing that the legislature had\nshown such tenderness for criminals of so dark a hue, and offered to\nprove, by undeniable instances, that there was not a mountain in\nWales which had not been, in his memory, the scene of necromancy and\nwitchcraft. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWherefore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am assuredly more than above\nastonished and confounded and concerned that the Parliament of Great\nBritain should, in their great wisdoms, and their prudence, and their\npenetration, give countenance and encouragement, look you, to the works\nof darkness and the empire of Pelzepup--ofer and apove the evidence of\nholy writ, and those writers who have been quoted by that aggurate and\nlearned shentleman, we are informed, by profane history, of the pribbles\nand pranks of the old serpent, in the bortents and oragles of antiquity,\nas you will find in that most excellent historian Bolypius, and Titus\nLifius; ay, and moreofer, in the Commentaries of Julius Caesar himself,\nwho, as the ole world knows, was a most famous, and a most faliant, and\na most wise, and a most prudent, and a most fortunate chieftain, and a\nmost renowned orator; ay, and a most elegant writer to boot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPeregrine did not think proper to enter the lists of dispute with three\nsuch obstinate antagonists, but contented himself with saying that he\nbelieved it would be no difficult matter to impugn the arguments\nthey had advanced; though he did not find himself at all disposed to\nundertake the task, which must of course break in upon the evening's\nentertainment. He therefore invited the Italian to supper, and asked\nthe same favour of his accuser, who seemed to have something curious and\ncharacteristic in his manner and disposition, resolving to make himself\nan eye-witness of those surprising feats which had given offence to\nthe choleric Briton. This scrupulous gentleman thanked our hero for\nhis courtesy, but declined communicating with the stranger until his\ncharacter should be further explained; upon which his inviter, after\nsome conversation with the charlatan, assured him that he would himself\nundertake for the innocence of his art; and then he was prevailed upon\nto favour them with his company.\n\nIn the course of the conversation, Peregrine learned that the Welshman\nwas a surgeon of Canterbury, who had been called in to a consultation at\nDover; and, understanding that his name was Morgan, took the liberty\nof asking if he was not the person so respectfully mentioned in the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAdventures of Roderick Random.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Morgan assumed a look of gravity\nand importance at this interrogation, and, screwing up his mouth,\nanswered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Rantum, my good sir, I believe, upon my conscience and\nsalfation, is my very goot frient and well-wisher; and he and I have\nbeen companions and messmates and fellow-sufferers, look you; but\nnevertheless, for all that, peradventure he hath not pehaved with so\nmuch complaisance and affability and respect as I might have expected\nfrom him; pecause he hath revealed and tivulged and buplished our\nprivate affairs, without my knowledge and privity and consent; but as\nGot is my Safiour, I think he had no evil intention in his pelly; and\nthough there be certain persons, look you, who, as I am told, take\nupon them to laugh at his descriptions of my person, deportment, and\nconversation, I do affirm and maintain, and insist with my heart, and\nmy plood, and my soul, that those persons are no petter than ignorant\nasses, and that they know not how to discern and distinguish and define\ntrue ridicule, or, as Aristotle calls it, the to Geloion, no more, look\nyou, than a herd of mountain goats; for I will make pold to observe--and\nI hope this goot company will be of the same opinion--that there is\nnothing said of me in that performance which is unworthy of a Christian\nand a shentleman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOur young gentleman and his friends acquiesced in the justness of his\nobservation. Peregrine particularly assured him that, from reading\nthe book, he had conceived the utmost regard and veneration for his\ncharacter, and that he thought himself extremely fortunate in having\nthis opportunity of enjoying his conversation. Morgan, not a little\nproud of such advances from a person of Peregrine's appearance, returned\nthe compliment with a profusion of civility, and, in the warmth of\nacknowledgment, expressed a desire of seeing him and his company at his\nhouse in Canterbury. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not pretend, or presume, kind sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nhe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto entertain you according to your merits and deserts; but you\nshall be as welcome to my poor cottage, and my wife and family, as the\nprince of Wales himself; and it shall go hard if, one way or other, I\ndo not find ways and means of making you confess that there is some goot\nfellowship in an ancient Priton; for though I am no petter than a simple\napothecary, I have as goot plood circulating in my veins as any he in\nthe county; and I can describe and delineate and demonstrate my pedigree\nto the satisfaction of the 'ole 'orld; and, moreofer, by Got's goot\nprovidence and assistance, I can afford to treat my friend with joint of\ngood mutton and a pottle of excellent wine, and no tradesman can peard\nme with a bill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was congratulated on his happy situation, and assured that our youth\nwould visit him on his return from France, provided he should take\nCanterbury in his route. As Peregrine manifested an inclination of\nbeing acquainted with the state of his affairs, he very complaisantly\nsatisfied his curiosity by giving him to know that his spouse had left\noff breeding, after having blessed him with two boys and a girl,\nwho were still alive and well; that he lived in good esteem with\nhis neighbors; and by his practice, which was considerably extended\nimmediately after the publication of Roderick Random, had saved some\nthousand pounds. He had begun to think of retiring among his own\nrelations in Glamorganshire, though his wife had made objection to this\nproposal, and opposed the execution of it with such obstinacy, that\nhe had been at infinite pains in asserting his own prerogative by\nconvincing her, both from reason and example, that he was king, and\npriest in his own family, and that she owed the most implicit submission\nto his will. He likewise informed the company that he had lately seen\nhis friend Roderick, who had come from London on purpose to visit him,\nafter having gained his lawsuit with Mr. Topeball, who was obliged to\npay Narcissa's fortune; that Mr. Random, in all appearance, led a very\nhappy life in the conversation of his father and bed-fellow, by whom he\nenjoyed a son and daughter; and that Morgan had received, in a present\nfrom him, a piece of very fine linen of his wife's own making, several\nkits of salmon, and two casks of pickled pork--the most delicate he\nhad ever tasted; together with a barrel of excellent herrings for\nsalmagundy, which he knew to be his favourite dish.\n\nThis topic of conversation being discussed, the Italian was desired to\nexhibit a specimen of his art, and in a few minutes he conducted the\ncompany into the next room, where, to their great astonishment and\naffright, they beheld a thousand serpents winding along the ceiling.\nMorgan, struck with this phenomenon, which he had not seen before, began\nto utter exorcisms with great devotion, Mr. Jolter ran of the room,\nGauntlet drew his hanger, and Peregrine himself was disconcerted. The\noperator, perceiving their confusion, desired them to retire, and,\ncalling them back in an instant, there was not a viper to be seen. He\nraised their admiration by sundry other performances and the Welshman's\nformer opinion and abhorrence of his character began to recur, when,\nin consideration of the civility with which he had been treated, this\nItalian imparted to them all the methods by which he had acted such\nwonders, that were no other than the effects of natural causes curiously\ncombined; so that Morgan became a convert to his skill, asked pardon for\nthe suspicion he had entertained, and invited the stranger to pass a\nfew days with him at Canterbury. The scruples of Godfrey and Jolter were\nremoved at the same time, and Peregrine testified his satisfaction by a\nhandsome gratuity which he bestowed upon their entertainer.\n\nThe evening being spent in this sociable manner, every man retired to\nhis respective chamber, and next morning they breakfasted together,\nwhen Morgan declared he would stay till he should see our hero fairly\nembarked, that he might have the pleasure of Mr. Gauntlet's company to\nhis own habitation: meanwhile, by the skipper's advice, the servants\nwere ordered to carry a store of wine and provision on board, in case of\naccident; and, as the packet-boat could not sail before one o'clock, the\ncompany walked up hill to visit the castle, where they saw the sword\nof Julius Caesar, and Queen Elizabeth's pocket pistol; repeated\nShakespeare's description, while they surveyed the chalky cliffs on each\nside, and cast their eyes towards the city of Calais, that was obscured\nby a thick cloud which did not much regale their eye-sight, because it\nseemed to portend foul weather.\n\nHaving viewed everything remarkable in this place, they returned to\nthe pier, where, after the compliments of parting, and an affectionate\nembrace between the two young gentlemen, Peregrine and his governor\nstepped aboard, the sails were hoisted, and they went to sea with a fair\nwind, while Godfrey, Morgan, and the conjurer walked back to the inn,\nfrom whence they set out for Canterbury before dinner.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\n\n\nHe embarks for France--Is overtaken by a Storm--Is surprised with\nthe Appearance of Pipes--Lands at Calais, and has an Affray with the\nOfficers at the Custom-house.\n\n\nScarce had the vessel proceeded two leagues on the passage, when, the\nwind shifting, blew directly in her teeth; so that they were obliged to\nhaul upon a wind, and alter their course. The sea running pretty high\nat the same time, our hero, who was below in his cabin, began to be\nsqueamish, and, in consequence of the skipper's advice, went upon deck\nfor the comfort of his stomach; while the governor, experienced in these\ndisasters, slipped into bed, where he lay at his ease, amusing himself\nwith a treatise on the cycloid, with algebraical demonstrations, which\nnever failed to engage his imagination in the most agreeable manner.\n\nIn the mean time the wind increased to a very hard gale, the vessel\npitched with great violence, the sea washed over the deck, the master\nwas alarmed, the crew were confounded, the passengers were overwhelmed\nwith sickness and fear, and universal distraction ensued. In the midst\nof this uproar, Peregrine holding fast by the taffrail, and looking\nruefully ahead, the countenance of Pipes presented itself to his\nastonished view, rising, as it were, from the hold of the ship. At first\nhe imagined it was a fear-formed shadow of his own brain; though he\ndid not long remain in this error, but plainly perceived that it was no\nother than the real person of Thomas, who, jumping on the quarter-deck,\ntook charge of the helm, and dictated to the sailors with as much\nauthority as if he had been commander of the ship. The skipper\nlooked upon him as an angel sent to his assistance; and the crew\nsoon discovered him to be a thoroughbred seaman, notwithstanding his\nlivery-frock; obeyed his orders with such alacrity, that, in a little\ntime, the confusion vanished; and every necessary step was taken to\nweather the gale.\n\nOur young gentleman immediately conceived the meaning of Tom's\nappearance on board; and when the tumult was a little subsided, went up,\nand encouraged him to exert himself for the preservation of the ship,\npromising to take him again into his service, from which he should never\nbe dismissed, except at his own desire. This assurance had a surprising\neffect upon Pipes, who, though he made no manner of reply, thrust the\nhelm into the master's hands, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere, you old bumboat-woman, take\nhold of the tiller, and keep her thus, boy, thus;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and skipped about the\nvessel, trimming the sails, and managing the ropes with such agility and\nskill, that everybody on deck stood amazed at his dexterity.\n\nMr. Jolter was far from being unconcerned at the uncommon motion of the\nvessel, the singing of the wind, and the uproar which he heard about\nhim: he looked towards the cabin-door with the most fearful expectation,\nin hope of seeing some person who could give some account of the\nweather, and what was doing upon deck; but not a soul appeared, and he\nwas too well acquainted with the disposition of his own bowels to make\nthe least alteration in his attitude. When he had lain a good while in\nall the agony of suspense, the boy tumbled headlong into his apartment,\nwith such noise, that he believed the mast had gone by the board; and\nstarting upright in his bed, asked, with all the symptoms of horror,\nwhat was the cause of that disturbance? The boy, half-stunned by his\nfall, answered in a dolorous tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm come to put up the dead-lights.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n At the mention of dead-lights, the meaning of which he did not\nunderstand, the poor governor's heart died within him: he shivered with\ndespair, his recollection forsaking him, he fell upon his knees in the\nbed, and, fixing his eyes upon the book which was in his hand, began to\npronounce aloud with great fervour, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe time of a complete oscillation\nin the cycloid, is to the time in which a body would fall through\nthe axis of the cycloid DV, as the circumference of a circle to its\ndiameter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe would in all likelihood have proceeded with the demonstration of this\nproposition, had he not been seized with such a qualm as compelled\nhim to drop the book, and accommodate himself to the emergency of his\ndistemper: he therefore stretched himself at full length, and, putting\nup ejaculations to Heaven, began to prepare himself for his latter end,\nwhen all of a sudden the noise above was intermitted; and as he could\nnot conceive the cause of this tremendous silence, he imagined that\neither the men were washed overboard, or that, despairing of safety,\nthey had ceased to oppose the tempest. While he was harrowed by this\nmiserable uncertainty, which, however, was not altogether unenlightened\nby some scattered rays of hope, the master entered the cabin: then he\nasked, with a voice half-extinguished by fear, how matters went upon\ndeck; and the skipper, with a large bottle of brandy applied to his\nmouth, answered, in a hollow tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll's over now, master.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Upon which,\nMr. Jolter, giving himself over for lost, exclaimed, with the utmost\nhorror, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLord have mercy upon us! Christ have mercy upon us;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\nrepeated this supplication, as it were mechanically, until the master\nundeceived him by explaining the meaning of what he had said, and\nassuring him that the squall was over.\n\nSuch a sudden transition from fear to joy occasioned a violent agitation\nboth in his mind and body; and it was a full quarter of an hour, before\nhe recovered the right use of his organs, By this time the weather\ncleared up, the wind began to blow again from the right corner, and the\nspires of Calais appeared at the distance of five leagues; so that the\ncountenances of all on board were lighted up with joyous expectation and\nPeregrine, venturing to go down into the cabin, comforted his governor\nwith an account of the happy turn of their affairs.\n\nJolter, transported with the thought of a speedy landing, began to\nlaunch out in praise of that country for which they were bound. He\nobserved, that France was the land of politeness and hospitality, which\nwere conspicuous in the behaviour of all ranks and degrees, from the\npeer to the peasant; that a gentleman and a foreigner, far from being\ninsulted and imposed upon by the lower class of people, as in England,\nwas treated with the utmost reverence, candour, and respect; and their\nfields were fertile, their climate pure healthy, their farmers rich and\nindustrious, the subjects in general the happiest of men. He would have\nprosecuted this favourite theme still farther, had not his pupil been\nobliged to run upon deck, in consequence of certain warnings he received\nfrom his stomach.\n\nThe skipper seeing his condition, very honestly reminded him of the cold\nham and fowls, with a basket of wine which he had ordered to be sent\non board, and asked if he would have the cloth laid below. He could\nnot have chosen a more seasonable opportunity of manifesting his own\ndisinterestedness. Peregrine made wry faces at the mention of food,\nbidding him, for Heaven's sake, talk no more on that subject. He then\ndescended into the cabin, and put the same question to Mr. Jolter, who,\nhe knew, entertained the same abhorrence for his proposal; and meeting\nwith the like reception from him, went between decks, and repeated his\ncourteous proffer to the valet-de-chambre and lacquey, who lay sprawling\nin all the pangs of a double evacuation, and rejected his civility with\nthe most horrible loathing. Thus baffled in all his kind endeavours,\nhe ordered the boy to secure the provision in one of his own lockers,\naccording to the custom of the ship.\n\nIt being low water when they arrived on the French coast, the vessel\ncould not enter the harbour, and they were obliged to bring to, and\nwait for a boat, which in less than half-an-hour came alongside from the\nshore. Mr. Jolter now came upon deck, and, snuffing up the French air\nwith symptoms of infinite satisfaction, asked of the boatmen, with the\nfriendly appellation of Mes enfants, what they demanded for transporting\nhim and his pupil with their baggage to the pier. But how was he\ndisconcerted, when those polite, candid, reasonable watermen demanded\na louis d'or for that service! Peregrine, with a sarcastic sneer,\nobserved, that he already began to perceive the justice of his encomiums\non the French; and the disappointed governor could say nothing in his\nown vindication, but that they were debauched by their intercourse with\nthe inhabitants of Dover. His pupil, however, was so much offended at\ntheir extortion, that he absolutely refused to employ them, even when\nthey abated one half in their demand, and swore he would stay on\nboard till the packet should be able to enter the harbour, rather than\nencourage such imposition.\n\nThe master, who in all probability had some sort of fellow-feeling with\nthe boatmen, in vain represented that he could not with safety lie-to\nor anchor upon a lee-shore: our hero, having consulted Pipes, answered,\nthat he had hired his vessel to transport him to Calais, and that he\nwould oblige him to perform what he had undertaken. The skipper, very\nmuch mortified at this peremptory reply, which was not over and above\nagreeable to Mr. Jolter, dismissed the boat, notwithstanding the\nsolicitations and condescension of the watermen. Running a little\nfarther in shore, they came to an anchor, and waited till there was\nwater enough to float them over the bar. Then they stood into the\nharbour; and our gentleman, with his attendants and baggage, were\nlanded on the pier by the sailors, whom he liberally rewarded for their\ntrouble.\n\nHe was immediately plied by a great number of porters, who, like so\nmany hungry wolves, laid hold on his baggage, and began to carry it off\npiecemeal, without his order or direction. Incensed at this officious\ninsolence, he commanded them to desist, with many oaths and opprobrious\nterms that his anger suggested; and perceiving, that one of them did\nnot seem to pay any regard to what he said, but marched off with his\nburthen, he snatched a cudgel out of his lacquey's hand, and overtaking\nthe fellow in a twinkling, brought him to the ground with one blow. He\nwas instantly surrounded by the whole congregation of this canaille, who\nresented the injury which their brother had sustained, and would have\ntaken immediate satisfaction on the aggressor, had not Pipes, seeing his\nmaster involved, brought the whole crew to his assistance, and exerted\nhimself so manfully that the enemy were obliged to retreat with many\nmarks of defeat, and menaces of interesting the commandant in their\nquarrel. Jolter, who knew and dreaded the power of the French governor,\nbegan to shake with apprehension, when he heard their repeated\nthreats, but they durst not apply to this magistrate, who, upon a fair\nrepresentation of the case, would have punished them severely for\ntheir rapacious and insolent behaviour. Peregrine, without further\nmolestation, availed himself of his own attendants, who shouldered his\nbaggage and followed him to the gate, where they were stopped by the\nsentinels until their names should be registered.\n\nMr. Jolter, who had undergone this examination before, resolved to\nprofit by his experience, and cunningly represented his pupil as a\nyoung English lord. This intimation, supported by the appearance of his\nequipage, was no sooner communicated to the officer, than he turned out\nthe guard, and ordered his soldiers to rest upon their arms, while his\nlordship passed in great state to the Lion d'Argent, where he took up\nhis lodging for the night, resolving to set out for Paris next morning\nin a post-chaise.\n\nThe governor triumphed greatly in this piece of complaisance and respect\nwith which they had been honoured, and resumed his beloved topic of\ndiscourse, in applauding the method and subordination of the French\ngovernment, which was better calculated for maintaining order and\nprotecting the people, than any constitution upon earth. Of their\ncourteous attention to strangers, there needed no other proof than the\ncompliment which had been paid to them, together with the governor's\nconnivance at Peregrine's employing his own servants in carrying the\nbaggage to the inn, contrary to the privilege of the inhabitants.\n\nWhile he expatiated with a remarkable degree of self-indulgence on\nthis subject, the valet-de-chambre coming into the room interrupted his\nharangue by telling his master that their trunks and portmanteaus must\nbe carried to the custom-house, in order to be searched, and sealed with\nlead, which must remain untouched until their arrival at Paris.\n\nPeregrine made no objection to this practice, which was in itself\nreasonable enough; but when he understood that the gate was besieged by\nanother multitude of porters, who insisted upon their right of carrying\nthe goods, and also of fixing their own price, he absolutely refused to\ncomply with their demand. Nay, he chastised some of the most clamorous\namong them with his foot, and told them, that if their custom-house\nofficers had a mind to examine his baggage, they might come to the inn\nfor that purpose. The valet-de-chambre was abashed at this boldness of\nhis master's behaviour, which the lacquey, shrugging up his shoulders,\nobserved, was bien a l'Anglaise; while the governor represented it as an\nindignity to the whole nation, and endeavoured to persuade his pupil to\ncomply with the custom of the place. But Peregrine's natural haughtiness\nof disposition hindered him from giving ear to Jolter's wholesome\nadvice; and in less than half-an-hour they observed a file of musketeers\nmarching up to the gate. At sight of this detachment the tutor trembled,\nthe valet grew pale, and the lacquey crossed himself; but our hero,\nwithout exhibiting any other symptoms than those of indignation, met\nthem on the threshold, and with a ferocious air demanded their business.\nThe corporal who commanded the file answered, with great deliberation,\nthat he had orders to convey his baggage to the custom-house; and seeing\nthe trunks standing in the entry, placed his men between them and the\nowner, while the porters that followed took them up, and proceeded to\nthe douane without opposition.\n\nPickle was not mad enough to dispute the authority of this message; but\nin order to gall and specify his contempt for those who brought it, he\ncalled aloud to his valet, desiring him, in French, to accompany his\nthings, and see that none of his linen and effects should be stolen by\nthe searchers. The corporal, mortified at this satirical insinuation,\ndarted a look of resentment at the author, as if he had been interested\nfor the glory of his nation; and told him that he could perceive he was\na stranger in France, or else he would have saved himself the trouble of\nsuch a needless precaution.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\n\n\nHe makes a fruitless Attempt in Gallantry--Departs for Boulogne, where\nhe spends the evening with certain English Exiles.\n\n\nHaving thus yielded to the hand of power, he inquired if there was any\nother English company in the house; when, understanding that a gentleman\nand lady lodged in the next apartment, and had bespoke a post-chaise for\nParis, he ordered Pipes to ingratiate himself with their footman, and,\nif possible, learn their names and condition, while he and Mr. Jolter,\nattended by the lacquey, took a turn round the ramparts, and viewed the\nparticulars of the fortification.\n\nTom was so very successful in his inquiry, that when his master\nreturned he was able to give him a very satisfactory account of his\nfellow-lodgers, in consequence of having treated his brother with a\nbottle of wine. The people in question were a gentleman and his lady\nlately arrived from England, in their way to Paris. The husband was\na man of good fortune, who had been a libertine in his youth, and a\nprofessed declaimer against matrimony. He wanted neither sense nor\nexperience, and piqued himself in particular upon his art of avoiding\nthe snares of the female sex, in which he pretended to be deeply versed;\nbut, notwithstanding all his caution and skill, he had lately fallen a\nsacrifice to the attractions of an oyster-wench, who had found means\nto decoy him into the bands of wedlock; and, in order to evade the\ncompliments and congratulations of his friends and acquaintance, he had\ncome so far on a tour to Paris, where he intended to initiate his spouse\nin the beau monde. In the mean time, he chose to live upon the reserve,\nbecause her natural talents had as yet received but little cultivation;\nand he had not the most implicit confidence in her virtue and\ndiscretion, which, it seems, had like to have yielded to the addresses\nof an officer at Canterbury, who had made shift to insinuate himself\ninto her acquaintance and favour.\n\nPeregrine's curiosity being inflamed by this information, he lounged\nabout the yard, in hopes of seeing the dulcinea who had captivated the\nold bachelor; and at length observing her at a window, took the liberty\nof bowing to her with great respect. She returned the compliment with a\ncurtsy, and appeared so decent in her dress and manner, that unless he\nhad been previously informed of her former life and conversation, he\nnever would have dreamt that her education was different from that\nof other ladies of fashion; so easy is it to acquire that external\ndeportment on which people of condition value themselves so much. Not\nbut that Mr. Pickle pretended to distinguish a certain vulgar audacity\nin her countenance, which in a lady of birth and fortune would have\npassed for an agreeable vivacity that enlivens the aspect, and gives\npoignancy to every feature; but as she possessed a pair of fine eyes,\nand a clear complexion overspread with a glow of health, which never\nfails of recommending the owner, he could not help gazing at her with\ndesire, and forming the design of making a conquest of her heart.\nWith this view, he sent his compliments to her husband whose name was\nHornbeck, with an intimation that he proposed to set out the next day\nfor Paris, and as he understood that he was resolved upon the same\njourney, he should be extremely glad of his company on the road, if he\nwas not better engaged. Hornbeck, who in all probability did not choose\nto accommodate his wife with a squire of our hero's appearance, sent a\ncivil answer to his message, professing infinite mortification at his\nbeing unable to embrace the favour of this kind offer, by reason of\nthe indisposition of his wife, who, he was afraid, would not be in a\ncondition for some days to bear the fatigue of travelling.\n\nThis rebuff, which Peregrine ascribed to the husband's jealousy, stifled\nhis project in embryo: he ordered his French servant to take a place\nfor himself in the diligence, where all his luggage was stowed, except a\nsmall trunk, with some linen and other necessaries, that was fixed upon\nthe post-chaise which they hired of the landlord; and early next morning\nhe and Mr. Jolter departed from Calais, attended by his valet-de-chambre\nand Pipes on horseback. They proceeded without any accident as far\nas Boulogne, where they breakfasted, and visited old Father Graham, a\nScottish gentleman of the governor's acquaintance, who had lived as a\nCapuchin in that place for the space of threescore years, and during\nthat period conformed to all the austerities of the order with the most\nrigorous exactness, being equally remarkable for the frankness of his\nconversation, the humanity of his disposition, and the simplicity of his\nmanners. From Boulogne they took their departure about noon; and as they\nproposed to sleep that night at Abbeville, commanded the postilion to\ndrive with extra ordinary speed. Perhaps it was well for his cattle that\nthe axletree gave way and the chaise of course overturned, before they\nhad travelled one-third part of the stage.\n\nThis accident compelled them to return to the place from whence they had\nset out; and as they could not procure another conveyance, they found\nthemselves under the necessity of staying till their chaise could be\nrefitted. Understanding that this operation would detain them a whole\nday, our young gentleman had recourse to his patience, and demanded\nto know what they could have for dinner; the garcon or waiter, thus\nquestioned, vanished in a moment, and immediately they were surprised\nwith the appearance of a strange figure, which, from the extravagance\nof its dress and gesticulation, Peregrine mistook for a madman of the\ngrowth of France. This phantom (which, by the bye, happened to be no\nother than the cook) was a tall, long-legged, meagre, swarthy fellow,\nthat stooped very much; his cheek-bones were remarkably raised, his nose\nbent into the shape and size of a powder-horn, and the sockets of his\neyes as raw round the edges as if the skin had been pared off. On his\nhead he wore a handkerchief, which had once been white, and now served\nto cover the upper part of a black periwig, to which was attached a bag\nat least a foot square, with a solitaire and rose that stuck upon each\nside of his ear; so that he looked like a criminal on the pillory. His\nback was accommodated with a linen waistcoat, his hands adorned with\nlong ruffles of the same piece, his middle was girded by an apron,\ntucked up, that it might not conceal his white silk stockings, rolled;\nand at his entrance he brandished a bloody weapon full three feet in\nlength.\n\nPeregrine, when he first saw him approach in this menacing attitude, put\nhimself upon his guard; but being informed of his quality, perused\nhis bill of fare, and having bespoken three or four things for dinner,\nwalked out with Mr. Jolter to view both towns, which they had not\nleisure to consider minutely before. In their return from the harbour\nthey met with four or five gentlemen, all of whom seemed to look with an\nair of dejection, and perceiving our hero and his governor to be English\nby their dress, bowed with great respect as they passed. Pickle, who\nwas naturally compassionate, felt an emotion of sympathy; and seeing a\nperson, who by his habit he judged to be one of their servants, accosted\nhim in English, and asked who the gentlemen were. The lacquey gave\nhim to understand that they were his own countrymen, called from their\nnative homes in consequence of their adherence to an unfortunate and\nruined cause; and that they were gone to the sea-side, according to\ntheir daily practice, in order to indulge their longing eyes with a\nprospect of the white cliffs of Albion, which they must never more\napproach.\n\nThough our young gentleman differed widely from them in point of\npolitical principles, he was not one of those enthusiasts who look upon\nevery schism from the established articles of faith as damnable,\nand exclude the sceptic from every benefit of humanity and Christian\nforgiveness: he could easily comprehend how a man of the most\nunblemished morals might, by the prejudice of education, or\nindispensable attachments, be engaged in such a blameworthy and\npernicious undertaking; and thought that they had already suffered\nseverely for their imprudence. He was affected with the account of their\ndiurnal pilgrimage to the sea-side, which he considered as a pathetic\nproof of their affliction, and invested Mr. Jolter with the agreeable\noffice of going to them with a compliment in his name, and begging the\nhonour of drinking a glass with them in the evening. They accepted the\nproposal with great satisfaction and respectful acknowledgment, and\nin the afternoon waited upon the kind inviter, who treated them with\ncoffee, and would have detained them to supper, but they entreated the\nfavour of his company at the house which they frequented so earnestly,\nthat he yielded to their solicitations, and, with his governor, was\nconducted by them to the place, where they had provided an elegant\nrepast, and regaled them with some of the best claret in France.\n\nIt was easy for them to perceive that their principal guest was no\nfavourer of their state maxims, and therefore they industriously avoided\nevery subject of conversation which could give the least offence: not\nbut they lamented their own situation, which cut them off from all their\ndearest connections, and doomed them to perpetual banishment from their\nfamilies and friends: but they did not, even by the most distant hint,\nimpeach the justice of that sentence by which they were condemned;\nalthough one among them, who seemed to be about the age of thirty, wept\nbitterly over his misfortune, which had involved a beloved wife and\nthree children in misery and distress; and, in the impatience of his\ngrief, cursed his own fate with frantic imprecations. His companions,\nwith a view of beguiling his sorrow, and manifesting their own\nhospitality at the same time, changed the topic of discourse, and\ncirculated the bumpers with great assiduity; so that all their cares\nwere overwhelmed and forgotten, several French drinking catches were\nsung, and mirth and good-fellowship prevailed.\n\nIn the midst of this elevation, which commonly unlocks the most hidden\nsentiment, and dispels every consideration of caution and constraint,\none of the entertainers, being more intoxicated than his fellows,\nproposed a toast, to which Peregrine, with some warmth, excepted as an\nunmannerly insult. The other maintained his proposition with indecent\nheat; and the dispute beginning to grow very serious, the company\ninterposed, and gave judgment against their friend, who was so keenly\nreproached and rebuked for his impolite behaviour, that he retired in\nhigh dudgeon, threatening to relinquish their society, and branding them\nwith the appellation apostates from the common cause. Mortified at the\nbehaviour of their companion, those that remained were earnest in\ntheir apologies to their guests, whom they besought to forgive his\nintemperance, assuring them with great confidence that he would, upon\nthe recovery of his reflection, wait upon them in person, and ask\npardon for the umbrage he had given. Pickle was satisfied with their\nremonstrances, resumed his good humour, and the night being pretty far\nadvanced resisted all their importunities with which he was entreated to\nsee another bottle go round, and was escorted to his own lodgings more\nthan half-seas over. Next morning, about eight o'clock, he was waked by\nhis valet-de-chambre, who told him that two of the gentlemen with whom\nhe had spent the evening were in the house, and desired the favour of\nbeing admitted into his chamber. He could not conceive the meaning of\nthis extraordinary visit; and, ordering his man to show them enter into\nhis apartment, beheld the person who had affronted him enter with the\ngentleman who had reprehended his rudeness.\n\nHe who had given the offence, after having made an apology for\ndisturbing Mr. Pickle, told him that his friend there present had been\nwith him early that morning, and proposed the alternative of either\nfighting with him immediately, or coming to beg pardon for his\nunmannerly deportment over-night: that though he had courage enough to\nface any man in the field in a righteous cause, he was not so brutal as\nto disobey the dictates of his own duty and reflection, in consequence\nof which, and not out of any regard to the other's menaces, which he\ndespised, he had now taken the liberty of interrupting his repose, that\nhe might, as soon as possible, atone for the injury he had done him,\nwhich he protested was the effect of intoxication alone, and begged his\nforgiveness accordingly. Our hero accepted of this acknowledgment very\ngraciously; thanked the other gentleman for the gallant part he had\nacted in his behalf; and perceiving that his companion was a little\nirritated at his officious interposition, effected a reconciliation, by\nconvincing him that what he had done was for the honour of the company.\nHe then kept them to his breakfast; expressed a desire of seeing their\nsituation altered for the better; and the chaise being repaired, took\nhis leave of his entertainers, who came to wish him a good journey, and\nwith his attendants left Boulogne for the second time.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\n\n\nProceeds for the Capital--Takes up his Lodging at Bernay, where he is\novertaken by Mr. Hornbeck, whose Head he longs to fortify.\n\n\nDuring this day's expedition, Mr. Jolter took an opportunity of\nimparting to his pupil the remarks he had made upon the industry of the\nFrench as an undeniable proof of which he bade him cast his eyes around,\nand observe with what care every spot of ground was cultivated, and from\nthe fertility of that province, which is reckoned the poorest in France,\nconceive the wealth and affluence of the nation in general. Peregrine,\namazed as well as disgusted at this infatuation, answered that what he\nascribed to industry was the effect of mere wretchedness; the miserable\npeasants being obliged to plough up every inch of ground to satisfy\ntheir oppressive landlords, while they themselves and their cattle\nlooked like so many images of famine; that their extreme poverty\nwas evident from the face of the country, on which there was not one\ninclosure to be seen, or any other object, except scanty crops of barley\nand oats, which could never reward the toil of the husbandman; that\ntheir habitations were no better than paltry huts; that in twenty miles\nof extent not one gentleman's house appeared; that nothing was more\nabject and forlorn than the attire of their country people; that the\nequipage of their travelling chaises was infinitely inferior to that\nof a dung-cart in England; and that the postilion who then drove their\ncarriage had neither stockings to his legs, nor a shirt to his back.\n\nThe governor, finding his charge so intractable resolved to leave him\nin the midst of his own ignorance and prejudice, and reserve his\nobservations for those who would pay more deference to his opinion: and\nindeed this resolution he had often made, and as often broken in the\ntransports of his zeal, that frequently hurried him out of the plan of\nconduct which in his cooler moments he had laid down. They halted for\nrefreshment at Montreuil, and about seven in the evening arrived at a\nvillage called Bernay, where, while they waited for fresh horses, they\nwere informed by the landlord that the gates of Abbeville were shut\nevery night punctually at eight o'clock, so that it would be impossible\nfor them to get admittance. He said there was not another place\nof entertainment on the road where they could pass the night; and\ntherefore, as a friend, he advised them to stay at his house, where they\nwould find the best of accommodation, and proceed upon their journey\nbetimes in the morning.\n\nMr. Jolter, though he had travelled on that road before, could not\nrecollect whether or not mine host spoke truth; but his remonstrance\nbeing very plausible, our hero determined to follow his advice, and\nbeing conducted into an apartment, asked what they could have for\nsupper. The landlord mentioned everything that was eatable in the house;\nand the whole being engrossed for the use of him and his attendants,\nhe amused himself, till such time as it should be dressed, in strolling\nabout the house, which stands in a very rural situation. While he thus\nloitered away the time that hung heavy on his hands, another chaise\narrived at the inn, and upon inquiry he found that the new-comers were\nMr. Hornbeck and his lady. The landlord, conscious of his inability to\nentertain this second company, came and begged with great humiliation\nthat Mr. Pickle would spare them some part of the victuals he had\nbespoken; but he refused to part with so much as the wing of a\npartridge, though at the same time he sent his compliments to the\nstrangers, and giving them to understand how ill the house was provided\nfor their reception, invited them to partake of his supper. Mr.\nHornbeck, who was not deficient in point of politeness, and extremely\nwell disposed for a relishing meal, which he had reason to expect from\nthe savoury steam that issued from the kitchen, could not resist this\nsecond instance of our young gentleman's civility, which he acknowledged\nin a message, importing that he and his wife would do themselves the\npleasure of profiting by his courteous offer. Peregrine's cheeks glowed\nwhen he found himself on the eve of being acquainted with Mrs. Hornbeck,\nof whose heart he had already made a conquest in imagination; and he\nforthwith set his invention at work, to contrive some means of defeating\nher husband's vigilance.\n\nWhen supper was ready, he in person gave notice to his guests, and,\nleading the lady into his apartment, seated her in an elbow-chair at the\nupper end of the table, squeezing her hand, and darting a most insidious\nglance at the same time. This abrupt behaviour he practised on the\npresumption that a lady of her breeding was not to be addressed with\nthe tedious forms that must be observed in one's advances to a person\nof birth and genteel education. In all probability his calculation was\njust, for Mrs. Hornbeck gave no signs of discontent at this sort of\ntreatment, but, on the contrary, seemed to consider it as a proof of\nthe young gentleman's regard; and though she did not venture to open\nher mouth three times during the whole repast, she showed herself\nparticularly well satisfied with her entertainer, by sundry sly and\nsignificant looks, while her husband's eyes were directed another way;\nand divers loud peals of laughter, signifying her approbation of the\nsallies which he uttered in the course of their conversation.\n\nHer spouse began to be very uneasy at the frank demeanour of his\nyoke-fellow, whom he endeavoured to check in her vivacity, by assuming\na severity of aspect; but whether she obeyed the dictates of her own\ndisposition, which, perhaps, was merry and unreserved, or wanted to\npunish Mr. Hornbeck for his jealousy of temper; certain it is, her\ngaiety increased to such a degree, that her husband was grievously\nalarmed and, incensed at her conduct, and resolved to make her sensible\nof his displeasure, by treading in secret upon her toes. He was,\nhowever, so disconcerted by his indignation, that he mistook his mark,\nand applied the sharp heel of his shoe to the side of Mr. Jolter's foot,\ncomprehending his little toe that was studded with an angry corn, which\nhe invaded with such a sudden jerk, that the governor, unable to endure\nthe torture in silence started up, and, dancing on the floor, roared\nhideously with repeated bellowings, to the enjoyment of Peregrine and\nthe lady, who laughed themselves almost into convulsions at the joke.\nHornbeck, confounded at the mistake he had committed, begged pardon of\nthe injured tutor with great contrition protesting that the blow he\nhad so unfortunately received, was intended for an ugly cur, which he\nthought had posted himself under the table. It was lucky for him that\nthere was actually a dog in the room, to justify this excuse, which\nJolter admitted with the tears running over his cheeks, and the economy\nof the table was recomposed.\n\nAs soon, however, as the strangers could with decency withdraw, this\nsuspicious husband took his leave of the youth, on pretence of being\nfatigued with his journey, after having, by way of compliment, proposed\nthat they should travel together next day; and Peregrine handed the\nlady to her chamber, where he wished her good night with another warm\nsqueeze, which she returned. This favourable hint made his heart bound\nwith a transport of joy: he lay in wait for an opportunity of declaring\nhimself; and seeing the husband go down into the yard with a candle,\nglided softly into his apartment, where he found her almost undressed.\nImpelled by the impetuosity of his passion, which was still more\ninflamed by her present luscious appearance, and encouraged by\nthe approbation she had already expressed, he ran towards her with\neagerness, crying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cZounds! madam, your charms are irresistible!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\nwithout further ceremony would have clasped her in his arms, had she not\nbegged him for the love of God to retire; for should Mr. Hornbeck return\nand find him there, she would be undone for ever. He was not so blinded\nby his passion, but that he saw the reasonableness of her fear; and as\nhe could not pretend to crown his wishes at that interview, he avowed\nhimself her lover, assured her that he would exhaust his whole invention\nin finding a proper opportunity for throwing himself at her feet; and in\nthe mean time he ravished sundry small favours, which she in the hurry\nof her fright, could not withhold from his impudence of address. Having\nthus settled the preliminaries, he withdrew to his own chamber, and\nspent the whole night in contriving stratagems to elude the jealous\ncaution of his fellow-traveller.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\n\n\nThey set out in company, breakfast at Abbeville, dine at Amiens and,\nabout eleven o'clock, arrive at Chantilly where Peregrine executes a\nPlan which he had concerted upon Hornbeck.\n\n\nThe whole company by agreement rose and departed before day, and\nbreakfasted at Abbeville, where they became acquainted with the finesse\nof their Bernay landlord, who had imposed upon them, in affirming that\nthey would not have been admitted after the gates were shut. From thence\nthey proceeded to Amiens, where they dined, and were pestered by begging\nfriars; and the roads being deep, it was eleven o'clock at night before\nthey reached Chantilly, where they found supper already dressed, in\nconsequence of having despatched the valet-de-chambre before them on\nhorseback.\n\nThe constitution of Hornbeck being very much impaired by a life of\nirregularity, he found himself so fatigued with his day's journey, which\namounted to upwards of a hundred miles, that when he sat down at table,\nhe could scarce sit upright; and in less than three minutes began to\nnod in his chair. Peregrine, who had foreseen and provided for this\noccasion, advised him to exhilarate his spirits with a glass of wine;\nand the proposal being embraced, tipped his valet-de-chambre the wink,\nwho, according to the instructions he had received, qualified the\nBurgundy with thirty drops of laudanum, which this unfortunate\nhusband swallowed in one glass. The dose, cooperating with his former\ndrowsiness, lulled him so fast to sleep, as it were instantaneously,\nthat it was found necessary to convey him to his own chamber, where his\nfootman undressed and put him to bed: nor was Jolter (naturally of a\nsluggish disposition) able to resist his propensity to sleep, without\nsuffering divers dreadful yawns, which encouraged his pupil to\nadminister the same dose to him, which had operated so successfully upon\nthe other Argus. This cordial had not such gentle effect upon the rugged\norgans of Jolter as upon the more delicate nerves of Hornbeck; but\ndiscovered itself in certain involuntary startings, and convulsive\nmotions in the muscles of his face; and when his nature at length\nyielded to the power of this medicine, he sounded the trumpet so loud\nthrough his nostrils, that our adventurer was afraid the noise would\nwake his other patient, and consequently the accomplishment of his aim.\nThe governor was therefore committed to the care of Pipes, who lugged\nhim into the next room, and having stripped off his clothes, tumbled him\ninto his nest, while the two lovers remained at full liberty to indulge\ntheir mutual passion.\n\nPeregrine, in the impatience of his inclination, would have finished\nthe fate of Hornbeck immediately; but his inamorata disapproved of his\nintention, and represented that their being together by themselves for\nany length of time would be observed by her servant, who was kept as a\nspy upon her actions; so that they had recourse to another scheme which\nwas executed in this manner. He conducted her into her own apartment in\npresence of her footman, who lighted them thither, and wishing her good\nrest, returned to his own chamber, where he waited till everything was\nquiet in the house; then stealing softly to her door, which had been\nleft open for his admission in the dark, he found the husband still\nsecure in the embraces of sleep, and the lady in a loose gown, ready to\nseal his happiness. He conveyed her to his own chamber; but his guilty\npassion was not gratified.\n\nThe opium which had been given to Jolter, together with the wine he had\ndrunk, produced such a perturbation in his fancy, that he was visited\nwith horrible dreams; and, among other miserable situations, imagined\nhimself in danger of perishing in the flames, which he thought had taken\nhold on his apartment. This vision made such an impression upon his\nfaculties, that he alarmed the whole house with repeated cries of \u00e2\u0080\u009cFire!\nfire!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and even leaped out of his bed, though he still continued fast\nasleep. The lovers were very disagreeably disturbed by this dreadful\nexclamation; and Mrs. Hornbeck, running in great confusion to the door,\nhad the mortification to see the footman, with a light in his hand,\nenter her husband's chamber, in order to give him notice of this\naccident. She knew that she would be instantly missed, and could easily\ndivine the consequence, unless her invention could immediately trump up\nsome plausible excuse for her absence.\n\nWomen are naturally fruitful of expedients in cases of such emergency:\nshe employed but a few seconds in recollection, and, rushing directly\ntowards the apartment of the governor, who still continued to hallo in\nthe same note, exclaimed, in a screaming tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLord have mercy upon us!\nwhere! where!\u00e2\u0080\u009d By this time, all the servants were assembled in strange\nattire: Peregrine burst into Jolter's room, and seeing him stalking in\nhis shirt, with his eyes shut, bestowed such a slap upon his back, as in\na moment dissolved his dream, and restored him to the use of his senses.\nHe was astonished and ashamed at being discovered in such an indecent\nattitude; and, taking refuge under the clothes, asked pardon of all\npresent for the disturbance he had occasioned; soliciting, with great\nhumility, the forgiveness of the lady, who, to a miracle, counterfeited\nthe utmost agitation of terror and surprise. Meanwhile Hornbeck, being\nawaked by the repeated efforts of his man, no sooner understood that his\nwife was missing, than all the chimeras of jealousy taking possession of\nhis imagination, he started up in a sort of frenzy, and, snatching his\nsword, flew straight to Peregrine's chamber; where, though he found not\nthat which he looked for, he unluckily perceived an under-petticoat,\nwhich his wife had forgot in the hurry of her retreat. This discovery\nadded fuel to the flame of his resentment. He seized the fatal proof of\nhis dishonour, and, meeting his spouse in her return to bed, presented\nit to her view, with a most expressive countenance, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam, you have\ndropped your under-petticoat in the next room.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Hornbeck, who inherited from nature a most admirable presence of\nmind, looked earnestly at the object in question, and, with incredible\nserenity of countenance, affirmed that the petticoat must belong to the\nhouse, for she had none such in her possession. Peregrine, who walked\nbehind her, hearing this asseveration, immediately interposed, and\npulling Hornbeck by the sleeve into his chamber, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGadszooks!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat business had you with that petticoat? Can't you let a young fellow\nenjoy a little amour with an innkeeper's daughter, without exposing his\ninfirmities to your wife? Pshaw! that's so malicious, because you have\nquitted these adventures yourself, to spoil the sport of other people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe poor husband was so confounded at the effrontery of his wife, and\nthis cavalier declaration of the young man, that his faith began to\nwaver; he distrusted his own conscious diffidence of temper, which, that\nhe might not expose, he expressed no doubts of Peregrine's veracity;\nbut, asking pardon for the mistake he had committed, retired. He was not\nyet satisfied with the behaviour of his ingenious helpmate, but on the\ncontrary determined to inquire more minutely into the circumstances of\nthis adventure, which turned out so little to his satisfaction, that he\nordered his servant to get everything ready for his departure by break\nof day; and when our adventurer rose next morning, he found that his\nfellow-travellers were gone above three hours, though they had agreed\nto stay all the forenoon, with a view of seeing the prince of Conde's\npalace, and to proceed all together for Paris in the afternoon.\n\nPeregrine was a little chagrined, when he understood that he was so\nsuddenly deprived of this untasted morsel; and Jolter could not conceive\nthe meaning of their abrupt and uncivil disappearance, which, after many\nprofound conjectures, he accounted for, by supposing that Hornbeck\nwas some sharper who had run away with an heiress, whom he found it\nnecessary to conceal from the inquiry of her friends. The pupil, who\nwas well assured of the true motive, allowed his governor to enjoy the\ntriumph of his own penetration, and consoled himself with the hope of\nseeing his dulcinea again at some of the public places in Paris, which\nhe proposed to frequent. Thus comforted, he visited the magnificent\nstables and palace of Chantilly, and immediately after dinner set out\nfor Paris, where they arrived in the evening, and hired apartments at an\nhotel in the Faubourg St. Germaine, not far from the playhouse.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\n\n\nHe is involved in an Adventure at Paris, and taken prisoner by the City\nGuard--Becomes acquainted with a French Nobleman, who introduces him in\nthe Beau Monde.\n\n\nThey were no sooner settled in these lodgings, than our hero wrote to\nhis uncle an account of their safe arrival, and sent another letter to\nhis friend Gauntlet, with a very tender billet inclosed for his dear\nEmilia, to whom he repeated all his former vows of constancy and love.\n\nThe next care that engrossed him was that of bespeaking several suits\nof clothes suitable to the French mode; and, in the mean time, he never\nappeared abroad, except in the English coffee-house, where he soon\nbecame acquainted with some of his own countrymen, who were at Paris on\nthe same footing with himself. The third evening after his journey, he\nwas engaged in a party of those young sparks, at the house of a noted\ntraiteur, whose wife was remarkably handsome, and otherwise extremely\nwell qualified for alluring customers to her house. To this lady our\nyoung gentleman was introduced as a stranger fresh from England; and\nhe was charmed with her personal accomplishments, as well as with the\nfreedom and gaiety of her conversation. Her frank deportment persuaded\nhim that she was one of those kind creatures who granted favours to the\nbest bidder: on this supposition he began to be so importunate in\nhis addresses, that the fair bourgeoise was compelled to cry aloud\nin defence of her own virtue. Her husband ran immediately to her\nassistance, and finding her in a very alarming situation, flew upon her\nravisher with such fury, that he was fain to quit his prey, and turn\nagainst the exasperated traiteur, whom he punished without mercy for\nhis impudent intrusion. The lady, seeing her yoke-fellow treated with\nso little respect, espoused his cause, and, fixing her nails in his\nantagonist's face, sacrificed all one side of his nose. The noise of\nthis encounter brought all the servants of the house to the rescue of\ntheir master; and Peregrine's company opposing them, a general battle\nensued, in which the French were totally routed, the wife insulted, and\nthe husband kicked downstairs.\n\nThe publican, enraged at the indignity which had been offered to him and\nhis family, went out into the street, and implored the protection of\nthe guet, or city guard, which, having heard his complaint, fixed their\nbayonets and surrounded the door, to the number of twelve or fourteen.\nThe young gentlemen, flushed with their success, and considering the\nsoldiers as so many London watchmen whom they had often put to flight,\ndrew their swords, and sallied out, with Peregrine at their head.\nWhether the guard respected them as foreigners, or inexperienced youths\nintoxicated with liquor, they opened to right and left, and gave them\nroom to pass without opposition. This complaisance, which was the effect\nof compassion, being misinterpreted by the English leader, he, out of\nmere wantonness, attempted to trip up the heels of the soldier that\nstood next him, but failed in the execution, and received a blow on his\nbreast with the butt-end of a fusil, that made him stagger several paces\nbackward. Incensed at this audacious application, the whole company\ncharged the detachment sword in hand and, after an obstinate engagement,\nin which divers wounds were given and received, every soul of them was\ntaken, and conveyed to the main-guard. The commanding officer being made\nacquainted with the circumstances of the quarrel, in consideration\nof their youth and national ferocity, for which the French make large\nallowances, set them all at liberty, after having gently rebuked them\nfor the irregularity and insolence of their conduct; so that all our\nhero acquired by his gallantry and courage, was a number of scandalous\nmarks upon his visage that confined him a whole week to his chamber.\nIt was impossible to conceal this disaster from Mr. Jolter, who, having\nobtained intelligence of the particulars, did not fail to remonstrate\nagainst the rashness of the adventure, which, he observed, must have\nbeen fatal to them, had their enemies been other than Frenchmen, who,\nof all people under the sun, most rigorously observe the laws of\nhospitality.\n\nAs the governor's acquaintance lay chiefly among Irish and English\npriests, and a set of low people who live by making themselves necessary\nto strangers, either in teaching the French language, or executing small\ncommissions with which they are intrusted, he was not the most proper\nperson in the world for regulating the taste of a young gentleman who\ntravelled for improvement, in expectation of making a figure one day\nin his own country. Being conscious of his own incapacity, he contented\nhimself with the office of a steward, and kept a faithful account of all\nthe money that was disbursed in the course of their family expense: not\nbut that he was acquainted with all the places which were visited by\nstrangers on their first arrival at Paris; and he knew to a liard what\nwas commonly given to the Swiss of each remarkable hotel; though, with\nrespect to the curious painting and statuary that everywhere abounded in\nthat metropolis, he was more ignorant than the domestic that attends for\na livre a day.\n\nIn short, Mr. Jolter could give a very good account of the stages on the\nroad, and save the expense of Antonini's detail of the curiosities\nin Paris: he was a connoisseur in ordinaries, from twelve to\nfive-and-thirty livres, knew all the rates of fiacre and remise, could\ndispute with a tailleur or a traiteur upon the articles of his bill,\nand scold the servants in tolerable French. But the laws, customs,\nand genius of the people, the characters of individuals, and scenes\nof polished life, were subjects which he had neither opportunities to\nobserve, inclination to consider, nor discernment to distinguish. All\nhis maxims were the suggestions of pedantry and prejudice; so that his\nperception was obscured, his judgment biased, his address awkward,\nand his conversation absurd and unentertaining: yet such as I have\nrepresented this tutor, are the greatest part of those animals who\nlead raw boys about the world, under the denomination of travelling\ngovernors. Peregrine, therefore, being perfectly well acquainted with\nthe extent of Mr. Jolter's abilities, never dreamt of consulting him\nin the disposition of his conduct, but parcelled out his time to the\ndictates of his own reflection, and the information and direction of his\ncompanions, who had lived longer in France, and consequently were better\nacquainted with the pleasures of the place.\n\nAs soon as he was in a condition to appear a la Francaise, he hired a\ngenteel chariot by the month, made the tour of the Luxembourg gallery,\nPalais Royal, all the remarkable hotels, churches, and celebrated places\nin Paris; visited St. Cloud, Marli, Versailles, Trianon, St. Germaine,\nand Fountainebleau, enjoyed the opera, Italian and French comedy; and\nseldom failed of appearing in the public walks, in hopes of meeting with\nMrs. Hornbeck, or some adventure suited to his romantic disposition.\nHe never doubted that his person would attract the notice of some\ndistinguished inamorata, and was vain enough to believe that few female\nhearts were able to resist the artillery of his accomplishments, should\nhe once find an opportunity of planting it to advantage. He presented\nhimself, however, at all the spectacles for many weeks, without reaping\nthe fruits of his expectation; and began to entertain a very indifferent\nidea of the French discernment, which had overlooked him so long,\nwhen one day, in his way to the opera, his chariot was stopped by an\nembarrass in the street, occasioned by two peasants, who having driven\ntheir carts against each other, quarrelled, and went to loggerheads on\nthe spot. Such a rencounter is so uncommon in France, that the people\nshut up their shops, and from their windows threw cold water upon the\ncombatants, with a view of putting an end to the battle, which was\nmaintained with great fury, and very little skill, until one of them\nreceiving an accidental fall, the other took the advantage of this\nmisfortune, and, fastening upon him, as he lay, began to thump the\npavement with his head.\n\nOur hero's equipage being detained close by the field of this\ncontention, Pipes could not bear to see the laws of boxing so\nscandalously transgressed, and, leaping from his station, pulled the\noffender from his antagonist, whom he raised up, and in the English\nlanguage encouraged to a second essay, instructing him at the same time\nby clenching his fists according to art, and putting himself in a proper\nattitude. Thus confirmed, the enraged carman sprang upon his foe, and\nin all appearance would have effectually revenged the injury he had\nsustained, if he had not been prevented by the interposition of a\nlacquey belonging to a nobleman, whose coach was obliged to halt in\nconsequence of the dispute. This footman, who was distinguished by\na cane, descending from his post, without the least ceremony or\nexpostulation, began to employ his weapon upon the head and shoulders\nof the peasant who had been patronized by Pipes; upon which, Thomas,\nresenting such ungenerous behaviour, bestowed such a stomacher upon\nthe officious intermeddler, as discomposed the whole economy of his\nentrails, and obliged him to discharge the interjection Ah! with\ndemonstrations of great anguish and amazement. The other two footmen\nwho stood behind the coach, seeing their fellow-servant so insolently\nassaulted, flew to his assistance, and rallied a most disagreeable\nshower upon the head of his aggressor, who had no means of diversion or\ndefence.\n\nPeregrine, though he did not approve of Tom's conduct, could not bear\nto see him so roughly handled, especially as he thought his own honour\nconcerned in the fray; and therefore, quitting his machine, came to the\nrescue of his attendant, and charged his adversaries sword in hand.\nTwo of them no sooner perceived this reinforcement, than they betook\nthemselves to flight; and Pipes, having twisted the cane out of the\nhands of the third, belaboured him so unmercifully, that our hero\nthought proper to interpose his authority in his behalf. The common\npeople stood aghast at this unprecedented boldness of Pickle, who\nunderstanding that the person whose servants he had disciplined was a\ngeneral and prince of the blood, went up to the coach, and asked pardon\nfor what he had done, imputing his own behaviour to his ignorance of\nthe other's quality. The old nobleman accepted of his apology with great\npoliteness, thanking him for the trouble he had taken to reform the\nmanners of his domestics; and guessing from our youth's appearance that\nhe was some stranger of condition, very courteously invited him into the\ncoach, on the supposition that they were both going to the opera. Pickle\ngladly embraced this opportunity of becoming acquainted with a person\nof such rank, and, ordering his own chariot to follow, accompanied\nthe count to his loge, where he conversed with him during the whole\nentertainment.\n\nHe soon perceived that Peregrine was not deficient in spirit or sense,\nand seemed particularly pleased with his engaging manner and easy\ndeportment, qualifications for which the English nation is by no means\nremarkable in France, and therefore the more conspicuous and agreeable\nin the character of our hero, whom the nobleman carried home that same\nevening, and introduced to his lady and several persons of fashion who\nsupped at his house. Peregrine was quite captivated by their affable\nbehaviour and the vivacity of their discourse; and, after having been\nhonoured with particular marks of consideration, took his leave, fully\ndetermined to cultivate such a valuable acquaintance.\n\nHis vanity suggested, that now the time was come when he should profit\nby his talents among the fair sex, on whom he resolved to employ his\nutmost art and address. With this view he assiduously engaged in all\nparties to which he had access by means of his noble friend, who let\nslip no opportunity of gratifying his ambition. He for some time shared\nin all his amusements, and was entertained in many of the best families\nof France; but he did not long enjoy that elevation of hope, which had\nflattered his imagination. He soon perceived that it would be impossible\nto maintain the honourable connections he had made, without engaging\nevery day at quadrille, or, in other words, losing his money; for every\nperson of rank, whether male or female, was a professed gamester, who\nknew and practised all the finesse of the art, of which he was entirely\nignorant. Besides, he began to find himself a mere novice in French\ngallantry, which is supported by an amazing volubility of tongue, and\nobsequious and incredible attention to trifles, a surprising faculty\nof laughing out of pure complaisance, and a nothingness of conversation\nwhich he could never attain. In short, our hero, who among his own\ncountrymen would have passed for a sprightly, entertaining fellow, was\nconsidered in the brilliant assemblies of France as a youth of a very\nphlegmatic disposition. No wonder, then, that his pride was mortified\nat his own want of importance, which he did not fail to ascribe to their\ndefect in point of judgment and taste. He conceived a disgust at the\nmercenary conduct, as well as the shallow intellects, of the ladies; and\nafter he had spent some months, and a round sum of money, in fruitless\nattendance and addresses, he fairly quitted the pursuit, and consoled\nhimself with the conversation of a merry fille de joie, whose good\ngraces he acquired by an allowance of twenty louis per month. That he\nmight the more easily afford this expense, he dismissed his chariot and\nFrench lacquey at the same time.\n\nHe then entered himself in a noted academy, in order to finish his\nexercises, and contracted an acquaintance with a few sensible people,\nwhom he distinguished at the coffee-house and ordinary to which he\nresorted, and who contributed not a little to the improvement of his\nknowledge and taste; for, prejudice apart, it must be owned that France\nabounds with men of consummate honour, profound sagacity, and the most\nliberal education. From the conversation of such, he obtained a distinct\nidea of their government and constitution; and though he could not help\nadmiring the excellent order and economy of their police, the result of\nall his inquiries was self-congratulation on his title to the privileges\nof a British subject. Indeed this invaluable birthright was rendered\nconspicuous by such flagrant occurrences, which fell every day almost\nunder his observation, that nothing but the grossest prejudice could\ndispute its existence.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\n\n\nAcquires a distinct Idea of the French Government--Quarrels with a\nMousquetaire, whom he afterwards fights and vanquishes, after having\npunished him for interfering in his amorous Recreations.\n\n\nAmong many other instances of the same nature, I believe it will not be\namiss to exhibit a few specimens of their administration, which happened\nduring his abode at Paris; that those who have not the opportunity\nof observing for themselves, or are in danger of being influenced by\nmisrepresentation, may compare their own condition with that of their\nneighbours, and do justice to the constitution under which they live.\n\nA lady of distinguished character having been lampooned by some obscure\nscribbler, who could not be discovered, the ministry, in consequence\nof her complaint, ordered no fewer than five-and-twenty abbes to be\napprehended and sent to the Bastille, on the maxim of Herod, when he\ncommanded the innocents to be murdered, hoping that the principal object\nof his cruelty would not escape in the general calamity; and the\nfriends of those unhappy prisoners durst not even complain of the unjust\npersecution, but shrugged up their shoulders, and in silence deplored\ntheir misfortune, uncertain whether or not they should ever set eyes on\nthem again.\n\nAbout the same time a gentleman of family, who had been oppressed by a\ncertain powerful duke that lived in the neighbourhood, found means to\nbe introduced to the king, who, receiving his petition very graciously,\nasked in what regiment he served; and when the memorialist answered\nthat he had not the honour of being in the service, returned the paper\nunopened, and refused to hear one circumstance of his complaint; so\nthat, far from being redressed, he remained more than ever exposed to\nthe tyranny of his oppressors; nay, so notorious is the discouragement\nof all those who presume to live independent of court favour and\nconnections that one of the gentlemen, whose friendship Peregrine\ncultivated, frankly owned he was in possession of a most romantic place\nin one of the provinces, and deeply enamoured of a country life; and\nyet he durst not reside upon his own estate, lest, by slackening in his\nattendance upon the great, who honoured him with their protection, he\nshould fall a prey to some rapacious intendant.\n\nAs for the common people, they are so much inured to the scourge and\ninsolence of power, that every shabby subaltern, every beggarly cadet of\nthe noblesse, every low retainer to the court, insults and injures them\nwith impunity. A certain ecuyer, or horsedealer, belonging to the king,\nbeing one day under the hands of a barber, who happened to cut the head\nof a pimple on his face, he started up, and drawing his sword, wounded\nhim desperately in the shoulder. The poor tradesman, hurt as he was,\nmade an effort to retire, and was followed by this barbarous assassin,\nwho, not contented with the vengeance he had taken, plunged his sword a\nsecond time into his body, and killed him on the spot. Having performed\nthis inhuman exploit, he dressed himself with great deliberation, and\ngoing to Versailles, immediately obtained a pardon for what he had done;\ntriumphing in his brutality with such insolence, that the very next time\nhe had occasion to be shaved he sat with his sword ready drawn, in order\nto repeat the murder, in case the barber should commit the same mistake.\nYet so tamed are those poor people to subjection, that when Peregrine\nmentioned this assassination to his own trimmer, with expressions of\nhorror and detestation, the infatuated wretch replied, that without\nall doubt it was a misfortune, but it proceeded from the gentleman's\npassion; and observed, by way of encomium on the government, that such\nvivacity is never punished in France.\n\nA few days after this outrage was committed, our youth, who was a\nprofessed enemy to all oppression, being in one of the first loges\nat the comedy, was eye-witness of an adventure which filled him with\nindignation: a tall, ferocious fellow, in the parterre, without the\nleast provocation, but prompted by the mere wantonness of pride, took\nhold of the hat of a very decent young man who happened to stand before\nhim, and twirled it round upon his head. The party thus offended turned\nto his aggressor, and civilly asked the reason of such treatment: but\nhe received no answer; and when he looked the other way, the insult\nwas repeated: upon which he expressed his resentment as became a man of\nspirit, and desired the offender to walk out with him. No sooner did\nhe thus signify his intention, than his adversary, swelling with rage,\ncocked his hat fiercely in his face, and, fixing his hands in his sides,\npronounced, with the most imperious tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHark ye, Mr. Round Periwig,\nyou must know that I am a mousquetaire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Scarce had this awful word\nescaped from his lips, when the blood forsook the lips of the poor\nchallenger, who, with the most abject submission, begged pardon for\nhis presumption, and with difficulty obtained it, on condition that he\nshould immediately quit the place. Having thus exercised his authority,\nhe turned to one of his companions, and, with an air of disdainful\nridicule, told him he was like to have had an affair with a bourgeois;\nadding, by way of heightening the irony, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEgad! I believe he is a\nphysician.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOur hero was so much shocked and irritated at this licentious behaviour,\nthat he could not suppress his resentment, which he manifested by saying\nto this Hector, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir, a physician may be a man of honour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To this\nremonstrance, which was delivered with a very significant countenance,\nthe mousquetaire made no other reply, but that of echoing his assertion\nwith a loud laugh, in which he was joined by his confederates.\nPeregrine, glowing with resentment, called him a fanfaron, and withdrew\nin expectation of being followed into the street. The other understood\nthe hint; and a rencounter must have ensued had not the officer of the\nguard, who overheard what passed, prevented their meeting, by putting\nthe mousquetaire immediately under arrest. Our young gentleman waited at\nthe door of the parterre, until he was informed of this interposition,\nand then went home very much chagrined at his disappointment; for he was\nan utter stranger to fear and diffidence on those occasions, and had set\nhis heart upon chastising the insolence of this bully, who had treated\nhim with such disrespect.\n\nThis adventure was not so private but that it reached the ears of Mr.\nJolter by the canal of some English gentlemen who were present when it\nhappened; and the governor, who entertained a most dreadful idea of\nthe mousquetaires, being alarmed at a quarrel, the consequence of which\nmight be fatal to his charge, waited on the British ambassador, and\nbegged he would take Peregrine under his immediate protection. His\nexcellency, having heard the circumstances of the dispute, sent one of\nhis gentlemen to invite the youth to dinner; and after having assured\nhim that he might depend upon his countenance and regard, represented\nthe rashness and impetuosity of his conduct so much to his conviction,\nthat he promised to act more circumspectly for the future, and drop all\nthoughts of the mousquetaire from that moment.\n\nA few days after he had taken this laudable resolution, Pipes, who had\ncarried a billet to his mistress, informed him that he had perceived a\nlaced hat lying upon a marble slab in her apartment; and that when\nshe came out of her own chamber to receive the letter, she appeared in\nmanifest disorder. From these hints of intelligence our young gentleman\nsuspected, or rather made no doubt of, her infidelity; and being by this\ntime well nigh cloyed with possession, was not sorry to find she had\ngiven him cause to renounce her correspondence. That he might therefore\ndetect her in the very breach of duty, and at the same time punish the\ngallant who had the presumption to invade his territories, he concerted\nwith himself a plan which was executed in this manner. During his next\ninterview with his dulcinea, far from discovering the least sign of\njealousy or discontent, he affected the appearance of extraordinary\nfondness, and, after having spent the afternoon with the show\nof uncommon satisfaction, told her he was engaged in a party for\nFountainebleau, and would set out from Paris that same evening; so that\nhe should not have the pleasure of seeing her again for some days.\n\nThe lady, who was very well versed in the arts of her occupation,\npretended to receive this piece of news with great affliction, and\nconjured him, with such marks of real tenderness, to return as soon as\npossible to her longing arms, that he went away almost convinced of her\nsincerity. Determined, however, to prosecute his scheme, he actually\ndeparted from Paris with two or three gentlemen of his acquaintance,\nwho had hired a remise for a jaunt to Versailles; and having accompanied\nthem as far as the village of Passe, he returned in the dusk of the\nevening on foot.\n\nHe waited impatiently till midnight, and then, arming himself with a\nbrace of pocket-pistols, and attended by trusty Tom with a cudgel in his\nhand, repaired to the lodgings of his suspected inamorata. Having given\nPipes his cue, he knocked gently at the door, which was no sooner opened\nby the lacquey, than he bolted in, before the fellow could recollect\nhimself from the confusion occasioned by his unexpected appearance; and,\nleaving Tom to guard the door, ordered the trembling valet to light\nhim upstairs into his lady's apartment. The first object that presented\nitself to his view, when he entered the antechamber, was a sword upon\nthe table, which he immediately seized, exclaiming, in a loud and\nmenacing voice, that his mistress was false, and then in bed with\nanother gallant, whom he would instantly put to death. This declaration,\nconfirmed by many terrible oaths, he calculated for the hearing of his\nrival, who, understanding his sanguinary purpose, started up in great\ntrepidation, and, naked as he was, dropped from the balcony into the\nstreet, while Peregrine thundered at the door for admittance, and,\nguessing his design, gave him an opportunity of making this precipitate\nretreat. Pipes, who stood sentinel at the door, observing the fugitive\ndescend, attacked him with his cudgel; and sweating him from one end of\nthe street to the other, at last committed him to the guet by whom he\nwas conveyed to the officer on duty in a most disgraceful and deplorable\ncondition.\n\nMeanwhile Peregrine, having burst open the chamber door, found the lady\nin the utmost dread and consternation, and the spoils of her favourite\nscattered about the room; but his resentment was doubly gratified, when\nhe learned, upon inquiry, that the person who had been so disagreeably\ninterrupted was no other than that individual mousquetaire with whom he\nhad quarrelled at the comedy. He upbraided the nymph with her\nperfidy and ingratitude; and telling her that she must not expect the\ncontinuance of his regard, or the appointments which she had hitherto\nenjoyed from his bounty, went home to his own lodgings, overjoyed at the\nissue of the adventure.\n\nThe soldier, exasperated at the disgrace he had undergone, as well as\nthe outrageous insult of the English valet, whom he believed his master\nhad tutored for that purpose, no sooner extricated himself from the\nopprobrious situation he had incurred, than, breathing vengeance\nagainst the author of the affront, he came to Peregrine's apartment, and\ndemanded satisfaction upon the ramparts next morning before sunrise.\nOur hero assured him he would not fail to pay his respects to him at the\ntime and place appointed; and foreseeing that he might be prevented from\nkeeping this engagement by the officious care of his governor, who saw\nthe mousquetaire come in, he told Mr. Jolter, that the Frenchman\nhad visited him in consequence of an order he had received from his\nsuperiors, to make an apology for his rude behaviour to him in the\nplayhouse, and that they had parted very good friends. This assurance,\ntogether with Pickle's tranquil and unconcerned behaviour through the\nday, quieted the terrors which had begun to take possession of his\ntutor's imagination; so that the youth had an opportunity of giving him\nthe slip at night, when he betook himself to the lodgings of a friend,\nwhom he engaged as his second, and with whom he immediately took the\nfield, in order to avoid the search which Jolter, upon missing him,\nmight set on foot.\n\nThis was a necessary precaution; for as he did not appear at supper, and\nPipes, who usually attended him in his excursions, could give no account\nof his motions, the governor was dreadfully alarmed at his absence, and\nordered his man to run in quest of his master to all the places which\nhe used to frequent, while he himself went to the commissaire, and,\ncommunicating his suspicions, was accommodated with a party of the\nhorse-guards, who patrolled round all the environs of the city, with a\nview of preventing the rencounter. Pipes might have directed them to the\nlady, by whose information they could have learned the name and lodgings\nof the mousquetaire, and if he had been apprehended the duel would not\nhave happened; but he did not choose to run the risk of disobliging his\nmaster by intermeddling in the affair, and was moreover very desirous\nthat the Frenchman should be humbled; for he never doubted that\nPeregrine was more than a match for any two men in France. In this\nconfidence, therefore, he sought his master with great diligence, not\nwith a view of disappointing his intention, but in order to attend him\nto the battle, that he might stand by him, and see justice done.\n\nWhile this inquiry was carried on, our hero and his companion concealed\nthemselves among some weeds, that grew on the edge of the parapet, a few\nyards from the spot where he had agreed to meet the mousquetaire;\nand scarce had the morning rendered objects distinguishable when they\nperceived their men advancing boldly to the place. Peregrine, seeing\nthem approach sprang forward to the ground, that he might have the glory\nof anticipating his antagonist; and swords being drawn, all four were\nengaged in a twinkling. Pickle's eagerness had well nigh cost him\nhis life; for, without minding his footing, he flew directly to his\nopposite, and, stumbling over a stone, was wounded on one side of his\nhead before he could recover his attitude. Far from being dispirited at\nthis check, it served only to animate him the more; being endowed with\nuncommon agility, he retrieved his posture in a moment; and having\nparried a second thrust, returned the lunge with such incredible speed,\nthat the soldier had not time to resume his guard, but was immediately\nrun through the bend of his right arm; and the sword dropping out of his\nhand, our hero's victory was complete.\n\nHaving despatched his own business, and received the acknowledgment of\nhis adversary who, with a look of infinite mortification, answered, that\nhis was the fortune of the day, he ran to part the seconds, just as the\nweapon was twisted out of his companion's hand: upon which he took his\nplace; and, in all likelihood, an obstinate dispute would have ensued,\nhad they not been interrupted by the guard, at sight of whom the two\nFrenchmen scampered off. Our young gentleman and his friend allowed\nthemselves to be taken prisoners by the detachment which had been sent\nout for that purpose, and were carried before the magistrate, who,\nhaving sharply reprimanded them for presuming to act in contempt of the\nlaws, set them at liberty, in consideration of their being strangers;\ncautioning them, at the same time, to beware of such exploits for the\nfuture.\n\nWhen Peregrine returned to his own lodgings, Pipes, seeing the blood\ntrickling down upon his master's neckcloth and solitaire, gave evident\ntokens of surprise and concern; not for the consequences of the wound,\nwhich he did no suppose dangerous, but for the glory of Old England,\nwhich he was afraid had suffered in the engagement; for he could not\nhelp saying, with an air of chagrin, as he followed the youth into his\nchamber, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do suppose as how you gave that lubberly Frenchman as good\nas he brought.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\n\n\nMr. Jolter threatens to leave him on account of his Misconduct, which he\npromises to rectify; but his Resolution is defeated by the Impetuosity\nof his Passions--He meets accidentally with Mrs. Hornbeck, who elopes\nwith him from her Husband, but is restored by the Interposition of the\nBritish Ambassador.\n\n\nThough Mr. Jolter was extremely well pleased at the safety of his pupil,\nhe could not forgive him for the terror and anxiety he had undergone on\nhis account; and roundly told him, that notwithstanding the inclination\nand attachment he had to his person, he would immediately depart for\nEngland, if ever he should hear of his being involved in such another\nadventure; for it could not be expected that he would sacrifice his own\nquiet, to an unrequited regard for one who seemed determined to keep him\nin continual uneasiness and apprehension.\n\nTo this declaration Pickle made answer, that Mr. Jolter, by this time,\nought to be convinced of the attention he had always paid to his ease\nand satisfaction; since he well knew that he had ever looked upon him in\nthe light of a friend rather than as a counsellor or tutor; and desired\nhis company in France with a view of promoting his interest, not for any\nemolument he could expect from his instruction. This being the case, he\nwas at liberty to consult his own inclinations, with regard to going or\nstaying; though he could not help owning himself obliged by the concern\nhe expressed for his safety, and would endeavour, for his own sake, to\navoid giving him any cause of disturbance in time to come.\n\nNo man was more capable of moralizing upon Peregrine's misconduct than\nhimself: his reflections were extremely just and sagacious, and attended\nwith no other disadvantage but that of occurring too late. He projected\na thousand salutary schemes of deportment, but, like other projectors,\nhe never had interest enough with the ministry of his passions to bring\nany of them to bear. He had, in the heyday of his gallantry received a\nletter from his friend Gauntlet with a kind postscript from his charming\nEmilia; but it arrived at a very unseasonable juncture, when his\nimagination was engrossed by conquests that more agreeably flattered his\nambition; so that he could not find leisure and inclination, from that\nday, to honour the correspondence which he himself had solicited. His\nvanity had, by the time, disapproved of the engagement he had contracted\nin the rawness and inexperience of youth; suggesting, that he was born\nto such an important figure in life, as ought to raise his ideas\nabove the consideration of any such middling connections, and fix his\nattention upon objects of the most sublime attraction. These dictates\nof ridiculous pride had almost effaced the remembrance of his amiable\nmistress, or at least so far warped his morals and integrity, that he\nactually began to conceive hopes of her altogether unworthy of his own\ncharacter and her deserts.\n\nMeanwhile, being destitute of a toy for the dalliance of his idle hours,\nhe employed several spies, and almost every day made a tour of the\npublic places in person, with a view of procuring intelligence of Mr.\nHornbeck, with whose wife he longed to have another interview. In this\ncourse of expectation had he exercised himself a whole fortnight, when,\nchancing to be at the Hospital of the Invalids with a gentleman lately\narrived from England, he no sooner entered the church than he perceived\nhis lady, attended by her spouse, who at sight of our hero changed\ncolour and looked another way, in order to discourage any communication\nbetween them. But the young man, who was not so easily repulsed,\nadvanced with great assurance to his fellow-traveller, and taking him by\nthe hand, expressed his satisfaction at this unexpected meeting; kindly\nupbraiding him for his precipitate retreat from Chantilly. Before\nHornbeck could make any reply he went up to his wife, whom he\ncomplimented in the same manner; assuring her, with some significant\nglances, he was extremely mortified that she had put it out of his power\nto pay his respects to her on his first arrival at Paris; and then,\nturning to her husband, who thought proper to keep close to him in this\nconference, begged to know where he could have the honour of waiting\nupon him; observing at the same time, that he himself lived a l'Academie\nde Palfrenier.\n\nMr. Hornbeck, without making any apology for his elopement on the road,\nthanked Mr. Pickle for his complaisance in a very cool and disobliging\nmanner; saying that as he intended to shift his lodgings in a day or\ntwo, he could not expect the pleasure of seeing him, until he should be\nsettled, when he would call at the academy, and conduct him to his new\nhabitation.\n\nPickle, who was not unacquainted with the sentiments of this jealous\ngentleman, did not put much confidence in his promise, and therefore\nmade divers efforts to enjoy a little private conversation with his\nwife; but he was baffled in all his attempts by the indefatigable\nvigilance of her keeper, and reaped no other immediate pleasure from\nthis accidental meeting, than that of a kind squeeze while he handed her\ninto the coach. However, as he had been witness to some instances of\nher invention, and was no stranger to the favourable disposition of\nher heart, he entertained some faint hopes of profiting by her\nunderstanding, and was not deceived in his expectation; for the very\nnext forenoon, a Savoyard called at the academy, and put the following\nbillet in his hand:--\n\n     \u00e2\u0080\u009cCoind Sur,--Heaving the playsure of meating with you at the\n     osspital of awilheads, I take this lubbertea of latin you\n     know, that I lotch at the hottail de May cong dangle rouy\n     Doghouseten, with two postis at the gait, naytheir of um very\n     hole, ware I shall be at the windore, if in kais you will be\n     so good as to pass that way at sicks a cloak in the heavening\n     when Mr. Hornbeck goes to the Calf hay de Contea. Prey for the\n     loaf of Geesus keep this from the nolegs of my hussban, ells he\n     will make me leed a hell upon urth.--Being all from, deer Sur,\n     your most umbell servan wile\n\n     \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeborah Hornbeck.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOur young gentleman was ravished at the receipt of this elegant epistle,\nwhich was directed, A Monsr. Monsr. Pickhell, a la Gaddamme de Paul\nFreny, and did not fail to obey the summons at the hour of assignation;\nwhen the lady, true to her appointment, beckoned him up-stairs, and he\nhad the good fortune to be admitted unseen.\n\nAfter the first transports of their mutual joy at meeting, she told him,\nthat her husband had been very surly and cross ever since the adventure\nat Chantilly, which he had not yet digested; that he had laid severe\ninjunctions upon her to avoid all commerce with Pickle, and even\nthreatened to shut her up in a convent for life, if ever she should\ndiscover the least inclination to renew that acquaintance; that she had\nbeen cooped up in her chamber since her arrival at Paris, without being\npermitted to see the place, or indeed any company, except that of her\nlandlady, whose language she did not understand; so that her spirit\nbeing broken, and her health impaired, he was prevailed upon some days\nago to indulge her in a few airings, during which she had seen the\ngardens of the Luxembourg, the Tuileries, and Palais Royal, though at\nthose times when there was no company in the walks; and that it was\nin one of those excursions she had the happiness of meeting with him.\nFinally, she gave him to understand, that rather than continue longer\nin such confinement with the man whom she could not love, she would\ninstantly give him the slip, and put herself under the protection of her\nlover.\n\nRash and unthinking as this declaration might be, the young\ngentleman was so much of a gallant, that he would not balk the\nlady's inclinations; and too infatuated by his passion to foresee the\nconsequences of such a dangerous step: he therefore, without hesitation,\nembraced the proposal; and the coast being clear, they sallied out into\nthe street, where Peregrine, calling a fiacre, ordered the coachman\nto drive them to a tavern; but knowing it would not be in his power to\nconceal her from the search of the lieutenant de police, if she should\nremain within the walls of Paris, he hired a remise, and carried her\nthat same evening to Villejuif, about four leagues from town, where he\nstayed with her all night; and having boarded her on a genteel pension,\nand settled the economy of his future visits, returned next day to his\nown lodgings.\n\nWhile he thus enjoyed his success, her husband endured the tortures of\nthe damned. When he returned from the coffee-house, and understood\nthat his wife had eloped, without being perceived by any person in the\nfamily, he began to rave and foam with rage and jealousy; and, in the\nfury of distraction, accused the landlady of being an accomplice in her\nescape, threatening to complain of her to the commissaire. The woman\ncould not conceive how Mrs. Hornbeck, who she knew was an utter stranger\nto the French language, and kept no sort of company, could elude the\ncaution of her husband, and find any refuge in a place where she had\nno acquaintance, and began to suspect the lodger's emotion was no other\nthan an affected passion to conceal his own practices upon his wife, who\nhad perhaps fallen a sacrifice to his jealous disposition. She therefore\nspared him the trouble of putting his menaces into execution by going to\nthe magistrate, without any further deliberation, and giving an account\nof what she knew concerning this mysterious affair, with certain\ninsinuations against Hornbeck's character, which she represented as\npeevish and capricious to the last degree.\n\nWhile she thus anticipated the purpose of the plaintiff, her information\nwas interrupted by the arrival of the party himself, who exhibited\nhis complaint with such evident marks of perturbation, anger, and\nimpatience, that the commissaire could easily perceive that he had\nno share in the disappearance of his wife, and directed him to the\nlieutenant de police, whose province it is to take cognizance of such\noccurrences. This gentleman, who presides over the city of Paris, having\nheard the particulars of Hornbeck's misfortune, asked if he suspected\nany individual person as the seducer of his yoke-fellow; and when he\nmentioned Peregrine as the object of his suspicion, granted a warrant\nand a detachment of soldiers, to search for and retrieve the fugitive.\n\nThe husband conducted them immediately to the academy where our hero\nlodged; and having rummaged the whole place, to the astonishment of\nMr. Jolter, without finding either his wife or the supposed ravisher,\naccompanied them to all the public-houses in the Faubourg, which having\nexamined also without success, he returned to the magistrate in a state\nof despair, and obtained a promise of his making such an effectual\ninquiry, that in three days he should have an account of her, provided\nshe was alive, and within the walls of Paris.\n\nOur adventurer, who had foreseen all this disturbance, was not at all\nsurprised when his governor told him what had happened, and conjured\nhim to restore the woman to the right owner, with many pathetic\nremonstrances touching the heinous sin of adultery, the distraction of\nthe unfortunate husband, and the danger of incurring the resentment of\nan arbitrary government, which, upon application being made would\nnot fail of espousing the cause of the injured. He denied, with great\neffrontery, that he had the least concern in the matter, pretended to\nresent the deportment of Hornbeck, whom he threatened to chastise for\nhis scandalous suspicion, and expressed his displeasure at the credulity\nof Jolter, who seemed to doubt the veracity of his asseveration.\n\nNotwithstanding this confident behaviour, Jolter could not help\nentertaining doubts of his sincerity, and, visiting the disconsolate\nswain, begged he would, for the honour of his country, as well as\nfor the sake of his own reputation, discontinue his addresses to the\nlieutenant de police, and apply to the British ambassador, who, by dint\nof friendly admonitions, would certainly prevail upon Mr. Pickle to do\nhim all the justice in his power, if he was really the author of\nthe injury he had sustained. The governor urged this advice with the\nappearance of so much sympathy and concern, promising to co-operate\nwithin his influence in his behalf, that Hornbeck embraced the proposal,\ncommunicated his purpose to the magistrate, who commended the resolution\nas the most decent and desirable expedient he could use, and then waited\nupon his excellency, who readily espoused his cause, and sending for the\nyoung gentleman that same evening, read him such a lecture in private,\nas extorted a confession of the whole affair. Not that he assailed him\nwith sour and supercilious maxims, or severe rebuke; because he\nhad penetration enough to discern that Peregrine's disposition was\nimpregnable to all such attacks; but he first of all rallied him on his\nintriguing genius; then, in a humorous manner, described the distraction\nof the poor cuckold, who he owned was justly punished for the absurdity\nof his conduct; and lastly, upon the supposition that it would be no\ngreat effort in Pickle to part with such a conquest, especially after\nit had been for some time possessed, represented the necessity and\nexpediency of restoring her, not only out of regard to his own character\nand that of his nation, but also with a view to his ease, which would in\na little time be very much invaded by such an incumbrance, that in all\nprobability would involve him in a thousand difficulties and disgusts.\nBesides, he assured him that he was already, by order of the lieutenant\nde police, surrounded with spies, who would watch all his motions, and\nimmediately discover the retreat in which he had disposed his prize.\nThese arguments, and the frank familiar manner in which they were\ndelivered--but, above all, the last consideration--induced the young\ngentleman to disclose the whole of his proceedings to the ambassador;\nand he promised to be governed by his direction, provided the lady\nshould not suffer for the step she had taken, but, be received by her\nhusband with due reverence and respect. These stipulations being agreed\nto, he undertook to produce her in eight-and-forty hours; and, taking\ncoach, immediately drove to the place of her residence, where he spent\na whole day and night in convincing her of the impossibility of their\nenjoying each other in that manner; then, returning to Paris, he\ndelivered her into the hands of the ambassador, who, having assured her\nthat she might depend upon his friendship and protection, in case she\nshould find herself aggrieved by the jealous temper of Mr. Hornbeck,\nrestored her to her legitimate lord, whom he counselled to exempt her\nfrom that restraint which in all probability had been the cause of\nher elopement, and endeavour to conciliate her affection by tender and\nrespectful usage.\n\nThe husband behaved with great humility and compliance, protesting\nthat his chief study should be to contrive parties for her pleasure and\nsatisfaction. But no sooner did he regain possession of his stray sheep,\nthan he locked her up more closely than ever; and after having revolved\nvarious schemes for her reformation, determined to board her in\na convent, under the inspection of a prudent abbess, who should\nsuperintend her morals, and recall her to the paths of virtue which\nshe had forsaken. With this view, he consulted an English priest of his\nacquaintance, who advised him to settle her in a monastery at Lisle,\nthat she might be as far as possible from the machinations of her lover,\nand gave him a letter of recommendation to the superior of a certain\nconvent in that place, for which Mr. Hornbeck set out in a few days with\nhis troublesome charge.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\n\n\nPeregrine resolves to return to England--Is diverted with the odd\nCharacters of two of his Countrymen, with whom he contracts an\nacquaintance in the Apartments of the Palais Royal.\n\n\nIn the mean time our hero received a letter from his aunt, importing\nthat the commodore was in a very declining way, and longed much to see\nhim at the garrison; and at the same time he heard from his sister, who\ngave him to understand that the young gentleman, who had for some\ntime made his addresses to her, was become very pressing in his\nsolicitations; so that she wanted to know in what manner she should\nanswer his repeated entreaties. Those two considerations determined the\nyoung gentleman to retain to his native country; a resolution that was\nfar from being disagreeable to Jolter, who knew that the incumbent on a\nliving which was in the gift of Trunnion was extremely old, and that\nit would be his interest to be upon the spot at the said incumbent's\ndecease.\n\nPeregrine, who had resided about fifteen months in France, thought he\nwas now sufficiently qualified for eclipsing most of his contemporaries\nin England, and therefore prepared for his departure with infinite\nalacrity; being moreover inflamed with the most ardent desire of\nrevisiting his friends, and renewing his connections, particularly with\nEmilia, whose heart he by this time, thought he was able to reduce on\nhis own terms.\n\nAs he proposed to make the tour of Flanders and Holland in his return\nto England, he resolved to stay at Paris a week or two after his affairs\nwere settled, in hope of finding some companion disposed for the same\njourney; and, in order to refresh his memory, made a second circuit\nround all the places in that capital, where any curious production of\nart is to be seen. In the course of this second examination he chanced\nto enter the Palais Royal, just as two gentlemen alighted from a fiacre\nat the gate; and all three being admitted at the same time, he soon\nperceived that the strangers were of his own country. One of them was a\nyoung man, in whose air and countenance appeared all the uncouth\ngravity and supercilious self-conceit of a physician piping-hot from his\nstudies; while the other, to whom his companion spoke by the appellation\nof Mr. Pallet, displayed at first sight a strange composition of levity\nand assurance. Indeed, their characters, dress, and address, were\nstrongly contrasted: the doctor wore a suit of black, and a huge\ntie-wig, neither suitable to his own age, nor the fashion of the country\nwhere he then lived; whereas the other, though seemingly turned of\nfifty, strutted in a gay summer dress of the Parisian cut, with a bag to\nhis own grey hair, and a red feather in his hat, which he carried under\nhis arm. As these figures seemed to promise something entertaining,\nPickle entered into conversation with them immediately, and soon\ndiscovered that the old gentleman was a painter from London, who had\nstolen a fortnight from his occupation, in order to visit the remarkable\npaintings of France and Flanders; and that the doctor had taken the\nopportunity of accompanying him in his tour. Being extremely talkative,\nhe not only communicated these particulars to our hero in a very few\nminutes after their meeting, but also took occasion to whisper in his\near that his fellow-traveller was a man of vast learning and, beyond\nall doubt, the greatest poet of the age. As for himself, he was under no\nnecessity of making his own eulogium; for he soon gave such specimens of\nhis taste and talents as left Pickle no room to doubt of his capacity.\n\nWhile they stood considering the pictures in one of the first\napartments, which are by no means the most masterly compositions,\nthe Swiss, who set up for a connoisseur, looking at a certain piece,\npronounced the word with a note of admiration; upon which Mr. Pallet,\nwho was not at all a critic in the French language, replied, with\ngreat vivacity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cManufac, you mean, and a very indifferent piece of\nmanufacture it is: pray, gentlemen, take notice; there is no keeping in\nthose heads upon the background, and no relief in the principal figure:\nthen you'll observe the shadings are harsh to the last degree; and, come\na little closer this way--don't you perceive that the foreshortening of\nthat arm is monstrous?--egad, sir! There is an absolute fracture in\nthe limb. Doctor, you understand anatomy: don't you think that muscle\nevidently misplaced? Hark ye, Mr. what-d'ye-call-um (turning to the\nattendant), what is the name of the dauber who painted that miserable\nperformance?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Swiss, imagining that he was all this time expressing\nhis satisfaction, sanctioned his supposed commendation by exclaiming\nsans prix. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Pallet: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could not recollect his name,\nthough his manner is quite familiar to me. We have a few pieces\nin England, done by that same Sangpree; but there they are in no\nestimation; we have more taste among us than to relish the productions\nof such a miserable gout. A'n't he an ignorant coxcomb, doctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The\nphysician, ashamed of his companion's blunder, thought it was necessary,\nfor the honour of his wan character, to take notice of it before the\nstranger, and therefore answered his question by repeating this line\nfrom Horace:--\n\nMutato nomine, de te fabula narratur.\n\nThe painter, who was rather more ignorant of Latin than of French,\ntaking it for granted that this quotation of his friend conveyed an\nassent to his opinion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cVery true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPotato domine date, this\npiece is not worth a single potato.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Peregrine was astonished at this\nsurprising perversion of the words and meaning of a Latin line, which,\nat first, he could not help thinking was a premeditated joke; but,\nupon second thoughts, he saw no reason to doubt that it was the\nextemporaneous effect of sheer pertness and ignorance, at which he\nbroke out into an immoderate fit of laughter. Pallet, believing that the\ngentleman's mirth was occasioned by his arch animadversion upon the work\nof Sangpree, underwent the same emotion in a much louder strain, and\nendeavoured to heighten the jest by more observations of the same\nnature; while the doctor, confounded at his impudence and want of\nknowledge, reprimanded him in these words of Homer:--\n\nSiga, me tis allos Achaion touton akouse muthon.\n\nThis rebuke, the reader will easily perceive, was not calculated for the\nmeridian of his friend's intellects, but uttered with a view of raising\nhis own character in the opinion of Mr. Pickle, who retorted this parade\nof learning in three verses from the same author, being part of the\nspeech of Polydamas to Hector, importing that it is impossible for one\nman to excel in everything.\n\nThe self-sufficient physician, who did not expect such a repartee from\na youth of Peregrine's appearance, looked upon his reply as a fair\nchallenge, and instantly rehearsed forty or fifty lines of the Iliad\nin a breath. Observing that the stranger made no effort to match this\neffusion, he interpreted his silence into submission; then, in order to\nascertain his victory, insulted him with divers fragments of authors,\nwhom his supposed competitor did not even know by name; while Mr. Pallet\nstared with admiration at the profound scholarship of his companion. Our\nyoung gentleman, far from repining at this superiority laughed within\nhimself at the ridiculous ambition of the pedantic doctor. He rated him\nin his own mind as a mere index-hunter, who held the eel of science by\nthe tail, and foresaw an infinite fund of diversion in his solemnity and\npride, if properly extracted by means of his fellow-traveller's\nvanity and assurance. Prompted by these considerations, he resolved to\ncultivate their acquaintance, and, if possible, amuse himself at their\nexpense in his journey through Flanders, understanding that they were\ndetermined upon the same route. In this view he treated them with\nextraordinary attention, and seemed to pay particular deference to the\nremarks of the painter, who, with great intrepidity, pronounced judgment\nupon every picture in the palace, or, in other words, exposed his own\nnakedness in every sentence that proceeded from his mouth.\n\nWhen they came to consider the Murder of the Innocents by Le Brun,\nthe Swiss observed, that it was un beau morceau, and Mr. Pallet\nreplied,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes, one may see with half an eye, that it can be\nthe production of no other; for Bomorso's style both in colouring\nand drapery, is altogether peculiar: then his design is tame, and his\nexpression antic and unnatural. Doctor, you have seen my judgment of\nSolomon; I think I may, without presumption--but, I don't choose to make\ncomparisons; I leave that odious task to other people, and let my works\nspeak for themselves. France, to be sure, is rich in the arts; but\nwhat is the reason? The king encourages men of genius with honour and\nrewards; whereas, in England, we are obliged to stand on our own feet,\nand combat the envy and malice of our brethren. Egad! I have a good mind\nto come and settle here in Paris. I should like to have an apartment in\nthe Louvre, with a snug pension of so many thousand livres.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn this manner did Pallet proceed with an eternal rotation of tongue,\nfloundering from one mistake to another, until it was the turn of\nPoussin's Seven Sacraments to be examined. Here again, the Swiss, out\nof the abundance of his zeal, expressed his admiration, by saying these\npieces were impayable; when the painter, turning to him, with an air of\nexultation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPardon me, friend, there you happen to be mistaken: these\nare none of Impayable's; but done by Nicholas Pouseen. I have seen\nprints of them in England, so that none of your tricks upon travellers,\nMr. Swiss or Swash, or what's your name.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He was much elated by this\nimaginary triumph of his understanding, which animated him to persevere\nin his curious observations upon all the other pieces of that celebrated\ncollection; but perceiving that the doctor manifested no signs of\npleasure and satisfaction, but rather beheld them with a silent air of\ndisdain, he could not digest his indifference, and asked, with a waggish\nsneer, if ever he had seen such a number of masterpieces before? The\nphysician, eyeing him with a look of compassion, mingled with contempt,\nobserved that there was nothing there which deserved the attention\nof any person acquainted with the ideas of the ancients; and that\nthe author of the finest piece now in being was unworthy to clean the\nbrushes of one of those great masters who are celebrated by the Greek\nand Roman writers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO lad! O lad!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the painter, with a loud laugh, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have\nfairly brought yourself into a dilemma at last, dear doctor; for it is\nwell known that your ancient Greek and Roman artists knew nothing at\nall of the matter, in comparison with our modern masters; for this good\nreason, because they had but three or four colours, and knew not how to\npaint with oil: besides, which of all your old fusty Grecians would you\nput upon a footing with the divine Raphael, the most excellent Michael\nAngelo, Bona Roti, the graceful Guido, the bewitching Titian, and above\nall others, the sublime Rubens, the--.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He would have proceeded with\na long catalogue of names which he had got by heart for the purpose,\nwithout retaining the least idea of their several qualifications, had\nnot he been interrupted by his friend, whose indignation being kindled\nby the irreverence with which he mentioned the Greeks, he called\nhim blasphemer, Goth, Boeotian, and, in his turn, asked with great\nvehemence, which of those puny moderns could match with Panaenus of\nAthens, and his brother Phidias; Polycletus of Sicyon; Polygnotus, the\nThracian; Parrhasius of Ephesus, surnamed Abrodiaitos, or the Beau; and\nApelles, the prince of painters? He challenged him to show any portrait\nof these days that could vie with the Helen of Zeuxis, the Heraclean; or\nany composition equal to the Sacrifice of Iphigenia, by Timanthes,\nthe Sicyonian; not to mention the Twelve Gods of Asclepiodorus, the\nAthenian, for which Mnason, tyrant of Elatea, gave him about three\nhundred pounds apiece; or Homer's Hell, by Nicias, who refused sixty\ntalents, amounting to upwards of eleven thousand pounds, and generously\nmade a present of it to his own country. He desired him to produce a\ncollection equal to that in the temple of Delphos, mentioned in the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIon\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Euripides; where Hercules and his companion Iolaus, are\nrepresented in the act of killing the Lernaean hydra with golden\nsickles, kruseais harpais, where Bellerophon appears on his winged\nsteed, vanquishing the fire-breathing chimera, tan puripneousan; and the\nwar of the giants is described. Here Jupiter stands wielding the red-hot\nthunderbolts, keraunon amphipuron; there Pallas, dreadful to the view,\nGorgopon, brandishes her spear against the huge Euceladus; and Bacchus,\nwith slender ivy rods, defeats and slays the ges teknon, or the mighty\nson of earth.\n\nThe painter was astonished and confounded at this rhapsody of names and\ninstances, which was uttered with surprising eagerness and rapidity,\nsuspecting at first that the whole was the creation of his own brain;\nbut when Pickle, with a view of flattering the doctor's self-conceit,\nespoused his side of the question, and confirmed the truth of everything\nhe advanced, Mr. Pallet changed his opinion, and in emphatic silence\nadored the immensity of his friend's understanding. In short, Peregrine\neasily perceived that they were false enthusiasts, without the smallest\npretensions to taste and sensibility; and pretended to be in raptures\nwith they knew not what; the one thinking it was incumbent upon him\nto express transports on seeing the works of those who had been most\neminent in their profession, whether they did or did not really raise\nhis admiration; and the other as a scholar deeming it his duty to\nmagnify the ancients above all competition, with an affected fervour,\nwhich the knowledge of their excellencies never inspired. Indeed, our\nyoung gentleman so successfully accommodated himself to the disposition\nof each, that long before their review was finished, he was become a\nparticular favourite with both.\n\nFrom the Palais Royal he accompanied them to the cloisters of the\nCarthusian's, where they considered the History of St. Bruno, by Le\nSueur, whose name being utterly unknown to the painter, he gave judgment\nagainst the whole composition, as pitiful and paltry; though, in the\nopinion of all good judges, it is a most masterly performance.\n\nHaving satisfied their curiosity in this place, Peregrine asked them\nto favour him with their company at dinner; but whether out of caution\nagainst the insinuations of one whose character they did not know, or by\nreason of a prior engagement, they declined his invitation on pretence\nof having an appointment at a certain ordinary, though they expressed\na desire of being further acquainted with him; and Mr. Pallet took the\nfreedom of asking his name, which he not only declared, but promised,\nas they were strangers in Paris, to wait upon them next day in the\nforenoon, in order to conduct them to the Hotel de Toulouse, and the\nhouses of several other noblemen, remarkable for painting or curious\nfurniture. They thankfully embraced his proposal, and that same day made\ninquiry among the English gentlemen about the character of our hero,\nwhich they found so much to their satisfaction, that, upon their second\nmeeting, they courted his good graces without reserve; and as they had\nheard of his intended departure, begged earnestly to have the honour of\naccompanying him through the Low Countries. He assured them that\nnothing could be more agreeable to him than the prospect of having such\nfellow-travellers; and they immediately appointed a day for setting out\non that tour.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\n\n\nHe introduces his new Friends to Mr. Jolter, with whom the Doctor enters\ninto a Dispute upon Government, which had well nigh terminated in open\nWar.\n\n\nMeanwhile, he not only made them acquainted with everything worth seeing\nin town but attended them in their excursions to all the king's houses\nwithin a day's journey of Paris; and in the course of these parties,\ntreated them with an elegant dinner at his own apartments, where a\ndispute arose between the doctor and Mr. Jolter, which had well nigh\nterminated in an irreconcilable animosity. These gentlemen, with an\nequal share of pride, pedantry, and saturnine disposition, were, by the\naccidents of education and company, diametrically opposite in\npolitical maxims; the one, as we have already observed, being a bigoted\nhigh-churchman, and the other a rank republican. It was an article of\nthe governor's creed, that the people could not be happy, nor the earth\nyield its fruits in abundance, under a restricted clergy and limited\ngovernment; whereas, in the doctor's opinion, it was an eternal truth,\nthat no constitution was so perfect as the democracy, and that no\ncountry could flourish but under the administration of the mob.\n\nThese considerations being premised, no wonder that they happened to\ndisagree in the freedom of an unreserved conversation, especially as\ntheir entertainer took all opportunities of encouraging and inflaming\nthe contention. The first source of their difference was an unlucky\nremark of the painter, who observed that the partridge, of which he was\nthen eating, had the finest relish of any he had ever tasted. His friend\nowned that the birds were the best of the kind he had seen in France;\nbut affirmed that they were neither so plump nor delicious as those that\nwere caught in England. The governor, considering this observation as\nthe effect of prejudice and inexperience, said, with a sarcastic smile,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe, sir, you are very well disposed to find everything here\ninferior to the productions of your own country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nthe physician, with a certain solemnity of aspect, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand not without\ngood reason, I hope.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd pray,\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed the tutor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy may not the\npartridges of France be as good as those of England?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor a very plain\nreason,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the other; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause they are not so well fed. The\niron hand of oppression is extended to all animals within the French\ndominions, even to the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air;\nkunessin oionoisi te pasi.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cEgad!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the painter, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is a truth\nnot to be controverted: for my own part, I am none of your tit-bits, one\nwould think; but yet there is a freshness in the English complexion, a\nginseekye, I think you call it, so inviting to a hungry Frenchman,\nthat I have caught several in the very act of viewing me with an eye of\nextreme appetite, as I passed; and as for their curs, or rather their\nwolves, whenever I set eyes on one of 'em, Ah! your humble servant, Mr.\nson of a b--, I am upon my guard in an instant. The doctor can testify\nthat their very horses, or more properly their live carrion, that drew\nour chaise, used to reach back their long necks and smell at us, as a\ncouple of delicious morsels.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis sally of Mr. Pallet, which was received with a general laugh of\napprobation, would in all probability, have stifled the dispute in\nembryo, had not Mr. Jolter, with a self-applauding simper, ironically\ncomplimented the strangers on their talking like true Englishmen. The\ndoctor, affronted at the insinuation, told him with some warmth that he\nwas mistaken in his conjecture, his affections and ideas being confined\nto no particular country; for he considered himself as a citizen of\nthe world. He owned himself more attached to England than to any other\nkingdom, but this preference was the effect of reflection, and not of\nprejudice; the British constitution approached nearer than any other to\nthat perfection of government, the democracy of Athens, he hoped one\nday to see revived; he mentioned the death of Charles the First, and the\nexpulsion of his son, with raptures of applause; inveighed with great\nacrimony against the kingly name; and, in order to strengthen his\nopinion, repeated forty or fifty lines from one of the Philippics of\nDemosthenes.\n\nJolter, hearing him speak so disrespectfully of the higher powers,\nglowed with indignation: he said his doctrines were detestable, and\ndestructive of all right, order, and society; that monarchy was of\ndivine institution, therefore indefeasible by any human power; and\nof consequence those events in the English history, which he had so\nliberally commended, were no other than flagrant instances of sacrilege,\nperfidy, and sedition; that the democracy of Athens was a most absurd\nconstitution, productive of anarchy and mischief, which must always\nhappen when the government of a nation depends upon the caprice of the\nignorant, hair-brained vulgar; that it was in the power of the most\nprofligate member of the commonwealth, provided he was endowed with\neloquence, to ruin the most deserving, by a desperate exertion of his\ntalents upon the populace, who had been often persuaded to act in the\nmost ungrateful and imprudent manner against the greatest patriots that\ntheir country had produced; and, finally, he averred, that the liberal\narts and sciences had never flourished so much in a republic as under\nthe encouragement and protection of absolute power: witness the Augustan\nage, and the reign of Louis the Fourteenth: nor was it to be supposed\nthat genius and merit could ever be so amply recompensed by the\nindividuals or distracted councils of a commonwealth, as by the\ngenerosity and magnificence of one who had the whole treasury at his own\ncommand.\n\nPeregrine, who was pleased to find the contest grow warm, observed that\nthere seemed to be a good deal of truth in what Mr. Jolter advanced;\nand the painter whose opinion began to waver, looked with a face\nof expectation at his friend, who, modelling his features into an\nexpression of exulting disdain, asked of his antagonist, if he did not\nthink that very power of rewarding merit enabled an absolute prince\nto indulge himself in the most arbitrary license over the lives and\nfortunes of his people? Before the governor had time to answer this\nquestion, Pallet broke forth into an exclamation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the Lord! that\nis certainly fact, egad! that was a home-thrust, doctor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When Mr.\nJolter, chastising this shallow intruder with a contemptuous look,\naffirmed that, though supreme power furnished a good prince with the\nmeans of exerting his virtues, it would not support a tyrant in the\nexercise of cruelty and oppression; because in all nations the genius\nof the people must be consulted by their governors, and the burthen\nproportioned to the shoulders on which it is laid. \u00e2\u0080\u009cElse, what follows?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said the physician. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe consequence is plain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the governor,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cinsurrection, revolt, and his own destruction; for it is not to\nbe supposed that the subjects of any nation would be so abject and\npusillanimous as to neglect the means which heaven hath put in their\npower for their own preservation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGadzooks, you're in the right, sir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n cried Pallet; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat, I grant you, must be confessed: doctor, I'm afraid\nwe have got into the wrong box.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This son of Paean, however, far from\nbeing of his friend's opinion, observed, with an air of triumph, that\nhe would not only demonstrate the sophistry of the gentleman's last\nallegation by argument and facts, but even confute him with his own\nwords. Jolter's eyes kindling at this presumptuous declaration, he told\nhis antagonist, while his lip quivered with resentment, that if his\narguments were no better than his breeding, he was sure he would make\nvery few converts to his opinion; and the doctor, with all the insolence\nof triumph, advised him to beware of disputes for the future, until he\nshould have made himself more master of his subject.\n\nPeregrine both wished and hoped to see the disputants proceed to\narguments of more weight and conviction; and the painter, dreading the\nsame issue, interposed with the usual exclamation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor God's sake,\ngentlemen;\u00e2\u0080\u009d when the governor rose from table in great dudgeon, and left\nthe room, muttering some ejaculation, of which the word coxcomb only\ncould be distinctly heard. The physician, being thus left master of the\nfield of battle, was complimented on his victory by Peregrine, and so\nelevated by his success, that he declaimed a full hour on the\nabsurdity of Jolter's proposition, and the beauty of the democratic\nadministration; canvassed the whole scheme of Plato's republic, with\nmany quotations from that ideal author, touching the to kalon: from\nthence he made a transition to the moral sense of Shaftesbury, and\nconcluded his harangue with the greatest part of that frothy writer's\nrhapsody, which he repeated with all the violence of enthusiastic\nagitation, to the unspeakable satisfaction of his entertainer, and\nthe unutterable admiration of Pallet, who looked upon him as something\nsupernatural and divine.\n\nSo intoxicated was this vain young man with the ironical praises of\nPickle, that he forthwith shook off all reserve; and having professed\na friendship for our hero, whose taste and learning he did not fail to\nextol, intimated in plain terms, that he was the only person, in these\nlatter ages, who possessed that genius, that portion of the divinity,\nor Ti Theion, which immortalized the Grecian poets: that as Pythagoras\naffirmed the spirit of Euphorbus had transmigrated into his body, he,\nthe doctor, strangely possessed with the opinion that he himself was\ninspired by the soul of Pindar; because, making allowance for the\ndifference of languages in which they wrote, there was a surprising\naffinity between his own works and those of that celebrated Theban; and\nas a confirmation of this truth, he immediately produced a sample of\neach, which, though in spirit and versification as different as the Odes\nof Horace and our present poet-laureat, Peregrine did not scruple to\npronounce altogether congenial, notwithstanding the violence he by\nthis sentence offered to his own conscience, and a certain alarm to\nhis pride, that was weak enough to be disturbed by the physician's\nridiculous vanity and presumption, which, not contented with displaying\nhis importance in the world of taste and polite literature, manifested\nitself in arrogating certain material discoveries in the province of\nphysic, which could not fail to advance him to the highest pinnacle of\nthat profession, considering the recommendation of his other talents,\ntogether with a liberal fortune which he inherited from his father.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\n\n\nThe Doctor prepares an Entertainment in the Manner of the Ancients,\nwhich is attended with divers ridiculous Circumstances.\n\n\nIn a word, our young gentleman, by his insinuating behaviour, acquired\nthe full confidence of the doctor, who invited him to an entertainment,\nwhich he intended to prepare in the manner of the ancients. Pickle,\nstruck with this idea, eagerly embraced the proposal, which he honoured\nwith many encomiums, as a plan in all respects worthy of his genius and\napprehension; and the day was appointed at some distance of time,\nthat the treater might have leisure to compose certain pickles and\nconfections which were not to be found among the culinary preparations\nof these degenerate days. With a view of rendering the physician's taste\nmore conspicuous, and extracting from it the more diversion, Peregrine\nproposed that some foreigners should partake of the banquet; and the\ntask being left to his care and discretion, he actually bespoke the\ncompany of a French marquis, an Italian count, and a German baron, whom\nhe knew to be egregious coxcombs, and therefore more likely to enhance\nthe joy of the entertainment.\n\nAccordingly, the hour being arrived, he conducted them to the hotel\nwhere the physician lodged, after having regaled their expectations with\nan elegant meal in the genuine old Roman taste; and they were received\nby Mr. Pallet, who did the honours of the house, while his friend\nsuperintended the cook below. By this communicative painter, the guests\nunderstood that the doctor had met with numerous difficulties in\nthe execution of his design; that no fewer than five cooks had been\ndismissed, because they could not prevail upon their own consciences to\nobey his directions in things that were contrary to the present practice\nof their art; and that although he had at last engaged a person, by\nan extraordinary premium, to comply with his orders, the fellow was so\nastonished, mortified, and incensed at the commands he had received,\nthat his hair stood on end, and he begged on his knees to be released\nfrom the agreement he had made; but finding that his employer insisted\nupon the performance of his contract, and threatened to introduce him\nto the commissaire if he should flinch from the bargain, he had, in the\ndischarge of his office, wept, sang, cursed, and capered for two whole\nhours without intermission.\n\nWhile the company listened to this odd information, by which they were\nprepossessed with strange notions of the dinner, their ears were invaded\nby a voice that exclaimed in French, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the love of God! dear sir! for\nthe passion of Jesus Christ! spare me the mortification of the honey\nand oil!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Their ears still vibrated with the sound, when the doctor\nentering, was by Peregrine made acquainted with the strangers, to whom\nhe, in the transports of his wrath, could not help complaining of the\nwant of complaisance he had found in the Parisian vulgar, by which his\nplan had been almost entirely ruined and set aside. The French marquis,\nwho thought the honour of his nation was concerned at this declaration,\nprofessed his sorrow for what had happened, so contrary to the\nestablished character of the people, and undertook to see the\ndelinquents severely punished, provided he could be informed of their\nnames or places of abode.\n\nThe mutual compliments that passed on this occasion were scarce\nfinished, when a servant, coming into the room, announced dinner; and\nthe entertainer led the way into another apartment, where they found a\nlong table, or rather two boards joined together, and furnished with a\nvariety of dishes, the steams of which had such evident effect upon the\nnerves of the company, that the marquis made frightful grimaces, under\npretence of taking snuff; the Italian's eyes watered; the German's\nvisage underwent several distortions of features; our hero found means\nto exclude the odour from his sense of smelling, by breathing only\nthrough his mouth; and the poor painter, running into another room,\nplugged his nostrils with tobacco. The doctor himself, who was the only\nperson present, whose organs were not discomposed, pointing to a couple\nof couches placed on each side of the table, told his guests that he was\nsorry he could not procure the exact triclinia of the ancients, which\nwere somewhat different from these conveniences, and desired they would\nhave the goodness to repose themselves without ceremony, each in his\nrespective couchette, while he and his friend Mr. Pallet would place\nthemselves upright at the ends, that they might have the pleasure of\nserving those that lay along. This disposition, of which the strangers\nhad no previous idea, disconcerted and perplexed them in a most\nridiculous manner; the marquis and baron stood bowing to each other,\non pretence of disputing the lower seat, but in reality with a view of\nprofiting by the example of one another, for neither of them understood\nthe manner in which they were to loll; and Peregrine, who enjoyed their\nconfusion, handed the count to the other side, where, with the most\nmischievous politeness, he insisted upon his taking possession of the\nupper place.\n\nIn this disagreeable and ludicrous suspense, they continue acting a\npantomime of gesticulations, until the doctor earnestly entreated them\nto waive all compliment and form, lest the dinner should be spoiled\nbefore the ceremonial could be adjusted. Thus conjured, Peregrine took\nthe lower couch on the left-hand-side, laying himself gently down, with\nhis face towards the table. The marquis, in imitation of this pattern\n(though he would have much rather fasted three days than run the risk of\ndiscomposing his dress by such an attitude), stretched himself upon the\nopposite place, reclining upon his elbow in a most painful and awkward\nsituation, with his head raised above the end of the couch, that the\neconomy of his hair might not suffer by the projection of his body. The\nItalian, being a thin limber creature, planted himself next to Pickle,\nwithout sustaining any misfortune but that of his stocking being torn\nby a ragged nail of the seat, as he raised his legs on a level with the\nrest of his limbs. But the baron, who was neither so wieldy nor supple\nin his joints as his companions, flounced himself down with such\nprecipitation, that his feet, suddenly tilting up, came in furious\ncontact with the head of the marquis, and demolished every curl in a\ntwinkling, while his own skull, at the same instant, descended upon the\nside of his couch, with such violence, that his periwig was struck off,\nand the whole room filled with pulvilio.\n\nThe drollery of distress that attended this disaster entirely vanquished\nthe affected gravity of our young gentleman, who was obliged to\nsuppress his laughter by cramming his handkerchief in his mouth; for the\nbare-headed German asked pardon with such ridiculous confusion, and\nthe marquis admitted his apology with such rueful complaisance, as were\nsufficient to awake the mirth of a quietist.\n\nThis misfortune being repaired as well as the circumstances of\nthe occasion would permit, and every one settled according to the\narrangement already described, the doctor graciously undertook to give\nsome account of the dishes as they occurred, that the company might be\ndirected in their choice: and with an air of infinite satisfaction thus\nbegan: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis here, gentlemen, is a boiled goose, served up in a sauce\ncomposed of pepper, lovage, coriander, mint, rue, anchovies; I wish\nfor your sakes, gentlemen, it was one of the geese of Ferrara, so much\ncelebrated among the ancients for the magnitude of their livers, one\nof which is said to have weighed upwards of two pounds; with this food,\nexquisite as it was, did the tyrant Heliogabalus regale his hounds. But\nI beg pardon, I had almost forgot the soup, which I hear is so necessary\nan article at all tables in France. At each end there are dishes of the\nsalacacabia of the Romans; one is made of parsley, pennyroyal, cheese,\npine-tops, honey, brine, eggs, cucumbers, onions, and hen livers; the\nother is much the same as the soup-maigre of this country. Then there\nis a loin of veal boiled with fennel and caraway-seed, on a pottage\ncomposed of pickle, oil, honey, and flour, and a curious hachis of the\nlights, liver, and blood of a hare, together with a dish of roasted\npigeons. Monsieur le baron, shall I help you to a plate of this soup?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n The German, who did not at all disapprove of the ingredients, assented\nto the proposal, and seemed to relish the composition; while the marquis\nbeing asked by the painter which of the silly-kickabys he chose, was,\nin consequence of his desire, accommodated with a portion of the\nsoup-maigre; and the count, in lieu of spoon-meat, of which he said he\nwas no great admirer, supplied himself with a pigeon, therein conforming\nto the choice of our young gentleman, whose example he determined to\nfollow through the whole course of the entertainment.\n\nThe Frenchman, having swallowed the first spoonful, made a full pause,\nhis throat swelled as if an egg had stuck in his gullet, his eyes\nrolled, and his mouth underwent a series of involuntary contractions and\ndilatations. Pallet, who looked steadfastly at this connoisseur, with a\nview of consulting his taste, before he himself would venture upon the\nsoup, began to be disturbed at these motions, and observed, with some\nconcern, that the poor gentleman seemed to be going into a fit; when\nPeregrine assured him, that these were symptoms of ecstasy, and, for\nfurther confirmation, asked the marquis how he found the soup. It was\nwith infinite difficulty that his complaisance could so far master\nhis disgust as to enable him to answer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAltogether excellent, upon my\nhonour!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the painter being certified of his approbation, lifted the\nspoon to his mouth without scruple, but far from justifying the eulogium\nof his taster, when this precious composition diffused itself upon his\npalate, he seemed to be deprived of all sense and motion, and sat like\nthe leaden statue of some river god, with the liquor flowing out at both\nsides of his mouth.\n\nThe doctor, alarmed at this indecent phenomenon, earnestly inquired into\nthe cause of it; and when Pallet recovered his recollection, and swore\nthat he would rather swallow porridge made of burning brimstone, than\nsuch an infernal mess as that which he had tasted, the physician, in\nhis own vindication, assured the company, that, except the usual\ningredients, he had mixed nothing in the soup but some sal ammoniac\ninstead of the ancient nitrum, which could not now be procured;\nand appealed to the marquis, whether such a succedaneum was not an\nimprovement on the whole. The unfortunate petit-maitre, driven to\nthe extremity of his condescension, acknowledged it to be a masterly\nrefinement; and deeming himself obliged, in point of honour, to evince\nhis sentiments by his practice, forced a few more mouthfuls of this\ndisagreeable potion down his throat, till his stomach was so much\noffended, that he was compelled to start up of a sudden; and, in the\nhurry of his elevation, overturned his plate into the bosom of the\nbaron. The emergency of this occasion would not permit him to stay and\nmake apologies for his abrupt behaviour; so that he flew into another\napartment, where Pickle found him puking and crossing himself with great\ndevotion; and a chair, at his desire, being brought to the door, he\nslipped into it more dead than alive, conjuring his friend Pickle to\nmake his peace with the company, and in particular excuse him to the\nbaron, on account of the violent fit of illness with which he had been\nseized. It was not without reason that he employed a mediator; for when\nour hero returned to the dining-room, the German got up, and was\nunder the hands of his own lacquey, who wiped the grease from a rich\nembroidered waistcoat, while he, almost frantic with his misfortune,\nstamped upon the ground, and in High Dutch cursed the unlucky banquet,\nand the impertinent entertainer, who all this time, with great\ndeliberation, consoled him for the disaster, by assuring him that the\ndamage done might be repaired with some oil of turpentine and a hot\niron. Peregrine, who could scarce refrain from laughing in his face,\nappeased his indignation by telling him how much the whole company, and\nespecially, the marquis, was mortified at the accident; and the unhappy\nsalacacabia being removed, the places were filled with two pies, one\nof dormice liquored with syrup of white poppies, which the doctor had\nsubstituted in the room of toasted poppy-seed, formerly eaten with\nhoney, as a dessert; and the other composed of a hock of pork baked in\nhoney.\n\nPallet, hearing the first of these dishes described, lifted up his hands\nand eyes, and with signs of loathing and amazement, pronounced, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA\npie made of dormice and syrup of poppies! Lord in heaven! what beastly\nfellows those Romans were!\u00e2\u0080\u009d His friend checked him for his irreverent\nexclamation with a severe look, and recommended the veal, of which he\nhimself cheerfully ate, with such encomiums to the company, that the\nbaron resolved to imitate his example, after having called for a bumper\nof Burgundy, which the physician, for his sake, wished to have been the\ntrue wine of Falernum. The painter, seeing nothing else upon the table\nwhich he would venture to touch, made a merit of necessity, and had\nrecourse to the veal also; although he could not help saying that he\nwould not give one slice of the roast beef of Old England for all the\ndainties of a Roman Emperor's table. But all the doctor's invitations\nand assurances could not prevail upon his guests to honour the hachis\nand the goose; and that course was succeeded by another, in which he\ntold them were divers of those dishes, which among the ancients had\nobtained the appellation of politeles, or magnificent. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat which\nsmokes in the middle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis a sow's stomach, filled with a\ncomposition of minced pork, hog's brains, eggs, pepper, cloves, garlic,\naniseed, rue, ginger, oil, wine, and pickle. On the right-hand side are\nthe teats and belly of a sow, just farrowed, fried with sweet wine, oil,\nflour, lovage, and pepper. On the left is a fricassee of snails, fed,\nor rather purged, with milk. At that end next Mr. Pallet are fritters\nof pompions, lovage, origanum, and oil; and here are a couple of pullets\nroasted and stuffed in the manner of Apicius.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe painter, who had by wry faces testified his abhorrence of the\nsow's stomach, which he compared to a bagpipe, and the snails which had\nundergone purgation, he no sooner heard him mention the roasted pullets,\nthan he eagerly solicited a wing of the fowl; upon which the doctor\ndesired he would take the trouble of cutting them up, and accordingly\nsent them round, while Pallet tucked the table-cloth under his chin,\nand brandished his knife and fork with singular address: but scarce were\nthey set down before him, when the tears ran down his cheeks; and he\ncalled aloud, in a manifest disorder, \u00e2\u0080\u009cZounds! this is the essence of a\nwhole bed of garlic!\u00e2\u0080\u009d That he might not, however, disappoint or disgrace\nthe entertainer, he applied his instruments to one of the birds; and\nwhen he opened up the cavity, was assaulted by such an irruption of\nintolerable smells, that, without staying to disengage himself from the\ncloth, he sprang away, with an exclamation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cLord Jesus!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and involved\nthe whole table in havoc, ruin, and confusion.\n\nBefore Pickle could accomplish his escape, he was sauced with the syrup\nof the dormouse pie, which went to pieces in the general wreck; and as\nfor the Italian count, he was overwhelmed by the sow's stomach, which,\nbursting in the fall, discharged its contents upon his leg and thigh,\nand scalded him so miserably, that he shrieked with anguish, and grinned\nwith a most ghastly and horrible aspect.\n\nThe baron, who sat secure without the vortex of this tumult, was not at\nall displeased at seeing his companions involved in such a calamity as\nthat which he had already shared; but the doctor was confounded with\nshame and vexation. After having prescribed an application of oil to\nthe count's leg, he expressed his sorrow for the misadventure, which he\nopenly ascribed to want of taste and prudence in the painter, who did\nnot think proper to return, and make an apology in person; and protested\nthat there was nothing in the fowls which could give offence to a\nsensible nose, the stuffing being a mixture of pepper, lovage, and\nassafoetida, and the sauce consisting of wine and herring-pickle, which\nhe had used instead of the celebrated garum of the Romans; that famous\npickle having been prepared sometimes of the scombri, which were a\nsort of tunny-fish, and sometimes of the silurus, or shad-fish: nay, he\nobserved that there was a third kind, called garum haemation, made of\nthe guts, gills, and blood of the thynnus.\n\nThe physician, finding it would be impracticable to re-establish the\norder of the banquet, by presenting again the dishes which had been\ndiscomposed, ordered everything to be removed, a clean cloth to be laid,\nand the dessert to be brought in. Meanwhile, he regretted his incapacity\nto give them a specimen of the aliens, or fish meals of the ancients,\nsuch as the jus diabaton, the conger-eel, which, in Galen's opinion, is\nhard of digestion; the cornuta, or gurnard, described by Pliny in his\nNatural History, who says, the horns of many of them were a foot and\na half in length, the mullet and lamprey, that were in the highest\nestimation of old, of which last Julius Caesar borrowed six thousand for\none triumphal supper. He observed that the manner of dressing them was\ndescribed by Horace, in the account he gives of the entertainment to\nwhich Maecenas was invited by the epicure Nasidienus:--\n\nAffertur squillas inter muraena natantes, etc.\n\nand told them that they were commonly eaten with the thus Syriacum,\na certain anodyne and astringent seed, which qualified the purgative\nnature of the fish. This learned physician gave them to understand, that\nthough this was reckoned a luxurious fish in the zenith of the Roman\ntaste, it was by no means comparable, in point of expense, to some\npreparations in vogue about the time of that absurd voluptuary\nHeliogabalus, who ordered the brains of six hundred ostriches to be\ncompounded in one illness.\n\nBy this time the dessert appeared, and the company were not a little\nrejoiced to see plain olives in salt and water: butt what the master of\nthe feast valued himself upon, was a sort of jelly, which he affirmed\nto be preferable to the hypotrimma of Hesychius, being a mixture of\nvinegar, pickle, and honey, boiled to proper consistence, and candied\nassafoetida, which he asserted, in contradiction to Aumelbergius and\nLister, was no other than the laser Syriacum, so precious, as to be sold\namong the ancients to the weight of a silver penny. The gentlemen took\nhis word for the excellency of this gum, but contented themselves with\nthe olives, which gave such an agreeable relish to the wine, that they\nseemed very well disposed to console themselves for the disgraces they\nhad endured; and Pickle, unwilling to lose the least circumstance of\nentertainment that could be enjoyed in their company, went in quest of\nthe painter, who remained in his penitentials in another apartment, and\ncould not be persuaded to re-enter the banqueting room, until Peregrine\nundertook to procure his pardon from those whom he had injured. Having\nassured him of this indulgence, our young gentleman led him in like a\ncriminal, bowing on all hands with all air of humility and contrition;\nand particularly addressing himself to the count, to whom he swore in\nEnglish, as God was his Saviour, he had no intent to affront man, woman,\nor child: but was fain to make the best of his way, that he might not\ngive the honourable company cause of offence, by obeying the dictates of\nnature in their presence.\n\nWhen Pickle interpreted this apology to the Italian, Pallet was forgiven\nin very polite terms, and even received into favour by his friend the\ndoctor, in consequence of our hero's intercession: so that all the\nguests forgot their chagrin, and paid their respects so piously to the\nbottle, that in a short time the Champagne produced very evident effects\nin the behaviour of all present.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\n\n\nThe Painter is persuaded to accompany Pickle to a Masquerade in\nWoman's Apparel---Is engaged in a troublesome Adventure, and, with his\nCompanion, conveyed to the Bastille.\n\n\nThe painter, at the request of Pickle, who had a design upon the count's\nsense of hearing, favoured the company with the song of Bumper Squire\nJones, which yielded infinite satisfaction to the baron, but affected\nthe delicate ears of the Italian in such a manner, that his features\nexpressed astonishment and disquiet; and by his sudden and repeated\njourneys to the door, it plainly appeared, that he was in the same\npredicament with those who, as Shakespeare observes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen the bagpipe\nsings in the nose, cannot contain their urine for affection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith a view, therefore, of vindicating music from such a barbarous\ntaste. Mr. Pallet had no sooner performed his task, than the count\nhonoured his friends with some favourite airs of his own country, which\nhe warbled with infinite grace and expression, though he had not energy\nsufficient to engage the attention of the German, who fell fast asleep\nupon his couch, and snored so loud, as to interrupt, and totally annul,\nthis ravishing entertainment; so that they were fain to have recourse\nagain to the glass, which made such innovation upon the brain of the\nphysician, that he sang divers odes of Anacreon to a tune of his own\ncomposing, and held forth upon the music and recitative of the ancients\nwith great erudition; while Pallet, having found means to make the\nItalian acquainted with the nature of his profession, harangued upon\npainting with wonderful volubility, in a language which (it was well for\nhis own credit) the stranger did not understand.\n\nAt length the doctor was seized with such a qualm, that he begged\nPeregrine to lead him to his chamber; and the baron, being waked,\nretired with the count. Peregrine, being rendered frolicsome with\nthe wine he had drunk, proposed that he and Pallet should go to a\nmasquerade, which he recollected was to be given that night. The painter\ndid not want curiosity and inclination to accompany him, but expressed\nhis apprehension of losing him in the ball; an accident which could\nnot fail to be very disagreeable, as he was an utter stranger to the\nlanguage and the town. To obviate this objection, the landlady, who was\nof their council, advised him to appear in a woman's dress, which would\nlay his companion under the necessity of attending him with more care,\nas he could not with decency detach himself from the lady whom he\nshould introduce; besides, such a connection would hinder the ladies of\npleasure from accosting and employing their seducing arts upon a person\nalready engaged.\n\nOur young gentleman foreseeing the abundance of diversion in the\nexecution of this project, seconded the proposal with such importunity\nand address, that the painter allowed himself to be habited in a suit\nbelonging to the landlady, who also procured for him a mask and domino,\nwhile Pickle provided himself with a Spanish dress. In this disguise,\nwhich they put on about eleven o'clock, did they, attended by Pipes,\nset out in a fiacre for the ball-room, into which Pickle led this\nsupposititious female, to the astonishment of the whole company, who had\nnever seen such an uncouth figure in the appearance of a woman.\n\nAfter they had taken a view of all the remarkable masks, and the painter\nhad been treated with a of glass of liqueur, his mischievous companion\ngave him the slip; and, vanishing in an instant, returned with\nanother mask and a domino over his habit, that he might enjoy Pallet's\nperplexity, and be at hand to protect him from insult. The poor painter,\nhaving lost his guide, was almost distracted with anxiety, and stalked\nabout the room, in quest of him, with such huge strides and oddity of\ngesture, that he was followed by a whole multitude, who gazed at him as\na preternatural phenomenon. This attendance increased his uneasiness\nto such a degree, that he could not help uttering a soliloquy aloud, in\nwhich he cursed his fate for having depended upon the promise of such a\nwag; and swore, that if once he was clear of this scrape, he would\nnot bring himself into such a premunire again for the whole kingdom of\nFrance.\n\nDivers petit-maitres, understanding the mask was a foreigner, who in all\nprobability could not speak French, made up to him in their turns, in\norder to display their wit and address, and teased him with several arch\nquestions, to which he made no other reply than \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo parly Francy. D--\nyour chattering! Go about your business, can't ye.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Among the masks\nwas a nobleman, who began to be very free with the supposed lady, and\nattempted to plunge his hand into her bosom: but the painter was too\nmodest to suffer such indecent treatment; and when the gallant repeated\nhis efforts in a manner still more indelicate, lent him such a box\non the ear, as made the lights dance before him, and created such a\nsuspicion of Pallet's sex, that the Frenchman swore he was either a male\nor a hermaphrodite, and insisted upon a scrutiny, for the sake of his\nown honour, with such obstinacy of resentment, that the nymph was in\nimminent danger, not only of being exposed, but also undergoing severe\nchastisement, for having made so free with the prince's ear; when\nPeregrine, who saw and overheard everything that passed, thought it was\nhigh time to interpose; and accordingly asserted his pretensions to the\ninsulted lady, who was overjoyed at this proof of his protection.\n\nThe affronted gallant persevered in demanding to know who she was, and\nour hero as strenuously refused to give him that satisfaction: so that\nhigh words ensued; and the prince threatening to punish his insolence,\nthe young gentleman, who was not supposed to know his quality, pointed\nto the place where his own sword used to hang, and, snapping his fingers\nin his face, laid hold on the painter's arm, and led him to another\npart of the room, leaving his antagonist to the meditations of his own\nrevenge.\n\nPallet, having chid his conductor for his barbarous desertion, made him\nacquainted with the difficulty in which he had been involved; and flatly\ntelling him he would not put it in his power to give him the slip again,\nheld fast by his arm during the remaining part of the entertainment, to\nthe no small diversion of the company, whose attention was altogether\nengrossed in the contemplation of such an awkward, ungainly, stalking\napparition. At last Pickle, being tired of exhibiting this raree-show,\ncomplied with the repeated desires of his companion, and handed her\ninto the coach; which he himself had no sooner entered, than they\nwere surrounded by a file of musqueteers, commanded by an exempt,\nwho, ordering the coach-door to be opened, took his place with great\ndeliberation, while one of his detachment mounted the box, in order to\ndirect the driver.\n\nPeregrine at once conceived the meaning of this arrest, and it was well\nfor him that he had no weapon wherewith to stand upon his defence; for\nsuch was the impetuosity and rashness of his temper, that, had he been\narmed, he would have run all risks rather than surrender himself to any\nodds whatever; but Pallet, imagining that the officer was some gentleman\nwho had mistaken their carriage for his own, desired his friend to\nundeceive the stranger; and when he was informed of the real state of\ntheir condition, his knees began to shake, his teeth to chatter, and he\nuttered a most doleful lamentation, importing his fear of being carried\nto some hideous dungeon of the Bastille, where he should spend the rest\nof his days in misery and horror, and never see the light of God's sun,\nnor the face of a friend; but perish in a foreign land, far removed from\nhis family and connexions. Pickle d--d him for his pusillanimity; and\nthe exempt hearing a lady bemoan herself so piteously, expressed his\nmortification at being the instrument of giving her such pain, and\nendeavoured to console them by representing the lenity of the French\ngovernment, and the singular generosity of the prince, by whose order\nthey were apprehended.\n\nPeregrine, whose discretion seemed to forsake him on all such occasions,\nexclaimed, with great bitterness, against the arbitrary administration\nof France, and inveighed, with many expressions of contempt, against\nthe character of the offended prince, whose resentment, far from being\nnoble, he mid, was pitiful, ungenerous, and unjust. To this remonstrance\nthe officer made no reply, but shrugged up his shoulders in silent\nastonishment at the hardiesse of the prisoner; and the fiacre was just\non the point of setting out, when they heard the noise of a scuffle at\nthe back of the coach, and the voice of Tom Pipes pronouncing, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll\nbe d--d if I do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This trusty attendant had been desired by one of the\nguards to descend from his station in the rear; but as he resolved to\nshare his master's fate, he took no notice of their entreaties, until\nthey were seconded by force; and that he endeavoured to repeal with his\nheel, which he applied with such energy to the jaws of the soldier, who\nfirst came in contact with him, that they emitted a crashing sound like\na dried walnut between the grinders of a Templar in the pit. Exasperated\nat this outrage, the other saluted Tom's posteriors with his bayonet,\nwhich incommoded him so much that he could no longer keep his post, but,\nleaping upon the ground, gave his antagonist a chuck under the chin, and\nlaid him upon his back, then skipping over him with infinite agility,\nabsconded among the crowd of coaches, till he saw the guard mount before\nand behind upon his master's fiacre, which no sooner set forward,\nthan he followed at a small distance, to reconnoitre the place where\nPeregrine should be confined. After having proceeded slowly through many\nwindings and turnings to a part of Paris, in which Pipes was an utter\nstranger, the coach stopped at a great gate, with a wicket in the\nmiddle, which, being opened at the approach of the carriage, the\nprisoners were admitted; and, the guard returning with the fiacre, Tom\ndetermined to watch in that place all night, that, in the morning, he\nmight make such observations as might be conducive to the enlargement of\nhis master.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\n\n\nBy the Fidelity of Pipes, Jolter is informed of his Pupil's\nfate--Confers with the Physician--Applies to the Ambassador, who, with\ngreat difficulty, obtains the Discharge of the Prisoners on certain\nConditions.\n\n\nThis plan he executed, notwithstanding the pain of his wound, and the\nquestions of the city-guard, both horse and foot, to which he could make\nno other answer than \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnglais, anglais;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and as soon as it was light,\ntaking an accurate survey of the castle (for such it seemed to be)\ninto which Peregrine and Pallet had been conveyed, together with its\nsituation in respect to the river, he went home to the lodgings, and,\nwaking Mr. Jolter, gave him an account of the adventure. The governor\nwrung his hands in the utmost grief and consternation when he heard\nthis unfortunate piece of news: he did not doubt that his pupil\nwas imprisoned in the Bastille for life; and, in the anguish of his\napprehension, cursed the day on which he had undertaken to superintend\nthe conduct of such an imprudent young man, who had, by reiterated\ninsults, provoked the vengeance of such a mild, forbearing\nadministration. That he might not, however, neglect any means in his\npower to extricate him from his present misfortune, he despatched Thomas\nto the doctor, with an account of his companion's fate, that they might\njoin their interest in behalf of the captives; and the physician, being\ninformed of what had happened, immediately dressed himself, and repaired\nto Jolter, whom he accosted in these words:--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, sir, I hope you are convinced of your error in asserting that\noppression can never be the effect of arbitrary power. Such a calamity\nas this could never have happened under the Athenian democracy: nay,\neven when the tyrant Pisistratus got possession of that commonwealth,\nhe durst not venture to rule with such absolute and unjust dominion. You\nshall see now that Mr. Pickle and my friend Pallet will fall a sacrifice\nto the tyranny of lawless power; and, in my opinion, we shall be\naccessory to the ruin of this poor enslaved people if we bestir\nourselves in demanding or imploring the release of our unhappy\ncountrymen; as we may thereby prevent the commission of a flagrant\ncrime, which would fill up the vengeance of Heaven against the\nperpetrators, and perhaps be the means of restoring the whole nation to\nthe unspeakable fruition of freedom. For my own part, I should rejoice\nto see the blood of my father spilt in such a glorious cause, provided\nsuch a victim would furnish me with the opportunity of dissolving the\nchains of slavery, and vindicating that liberty which is the birthright\nof man. Then would my name be immortalised among the patriot heroes of\nantiquity, and my memory, like that of Harmodius and Aristogiton, be\nhonoured by statues erected at the public expense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis rhapsody, which was delivered with great emphasis and agitation,\ngave so much offence to Jolter, that, without saying one word, he\nretired in great wrath to his own chamber; and the republican returned\nto his lodging, in full hope of his prognostic being verified in the\ndeath and destruction of Peregrine and the painter, which must give rise\nto some renowned revolution, wherein he himself would act a principal\npart. But the governor whose imagination was not quite so warm and\nprolific, went directly to the ambassador, whom he informed of his\npupil's situation, and besought to interpose with the French ministry,\nthat he and the other British subject might obtain their liberty.\n\nHis excellency asked, if Jolter could guess at the cause of his\nimprisonment, that he might be the better prepared to vindicate or\nexcuse his conduct: but neither he nor Pipes could give the smallest\nhint of intelligence on that subject; though he furnished himself from\nTom's own mouth with a circumstantial account of the manner in which\nhis master had been arrested, as well as of his own behaviour, and the\ndisaster he had received on that occasion. His lordship never doubted\nthat Pickle had brought this calamity upon himself by some unlucky\nprank he had played at the masquerade; when he understood that the young\ngentleman had drunk freely in the afternoon, and been so whimsical as to\ngo thither with a man in woman's apparel; and he that same day waited on\nthe French minister, in full confidence of obtaining his discharge; but\nmet with more difficulty than he expected, the court of France being\nextremely punctilious in everything that concerns a prince of the blood:\nthe ambassador was therefore obliged to talk in very high terms; and,\nthough the present circumstances of the French politics would not allow\nthem to fall out with the British administration for trifles, all the\nfavour he could procure was to promise that Pickle should be set at\nliberty, provided he would ask pardon of the prince to whom he had given\noffence.\n\nHis excellency thought this was but a reasonable condescension,\nsupposing Peregrine to have been in the wrong; and Jolter was admitted\nto him in order to communicate and reinforce his lordship's advice,\nwhich was, that he comply with the terms proposed. The governor, who\ndid not enter this gloomy fortress without fear and trembling, found\nhis pupil in a dismal apartment, void of all furniture but a stool and\na truckle-bed. The moment he was admitted, he perceived the youth\nwhistling with great unconcern, and working with his pencil at the bare\nwall, on which he had delineated a ludicrous figure labelled with the\nname of the nobleman, whom he had affronted, and an English mastiff with\nhis leg lifted up, in the attitude of making water in his shoe. He\nhad been even so presumptuous as to explain the device with satirical\ninscriptions in the French language, which, when Jolter perused, his\nhair stood on end with affright. The very turnkey was confounded and\noverawed by the boldness of his behaviour, which he had never seen\nmatched by any inhabitant of that place; and actually joined his friend\nin persuading him to submit to the easy demand of the minister. But our\nhero, far from embracing the counsel of this advocate, handed him to the\ndoor with great ceremony, and dismissed him with a kick on the breeches;\nand, to all the supplications, and even tears of Jolter, made no other\nreply than that he would stoop to no condescension, because he had\ncommitted no crime, but would leave his case to the cognisance and\nexertion of the British court, whose duty it was to see justice done to\nits own subjects: he desired, however, that Pallet, who was confined\nin another place, might avail himself of his own disposition, which\nwas sufficiently pliable; but when the governor desired to see his\nfellow-prisoner, the turnkey gave him to understand that he had received\nno orders relating to the lady, and therefore could not admit him into\nher apartment; though he was complaisant enough to tell him that she\nseemed very much mortified at her confinement, and at certain times\nbehaved as if her brain was not a little disordered.\n\nJolter, thus baffled in all his endeavours, quitted the Bastille with a\nheavy heart, and reported his fruitless negotiation to the ambassador,\nwho could not help breaking forth into some acrimonious expressions\nagainst the obstinacy and insolence of the young man, who, he said,\ndeserved to suffer for his folly. Nevertheless, he did not desist\nfrom his representations to the French ministry, which he found so\nunyielding, that he was obliged to threaten, in plain terms, to make it\na national concern; and not only wrote to his court for instructions,\nbut even advised the council to make reprisals, and send some French\ngentleman in London to the Tower.\n\nThis intimation had an effect upon the ministry at Versailles, who,\nrather than run the risk of incensing a people whom it was neither\ntheir interest nor inclination to disoblige, consented to discharge the\noffenders, on condition that they should leave Paris in three days after\ntheir enlargement. This proposal was readily agreed to by Peregrine, who\nwas now a little more tractable, and heartily tired of being cooped\nup in such an uncomfortable abode, for the space of three long days,\nwithout any sort of communication or entertainment but that which his\nown imagination suggested.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\n\n\nPeregrine makes himself Merry at the Expense of the Painter, who curses\nhis Landlady, and breaks with the Doctor.\n\n\nAs he could easily conceive the situation of his companion in adversity,\nhe was unwilling to leave the place until he had reaped some diversion\nfrom his distress, and with that view repaired to the dungeon of the\nafflicted painter, to which he had by this time free access. When\nhe entered, the first object that presented itself to his eye was so\nuncommonly ridiculous, that he could scarce preserve that gravity of\ncountenance which he had affected in order to execute the joke he had\nplanned. The forlorn Pallet sat upright in his bed in a deshabille that\nwas altogether extraordinary. He had laid aside his monstrous hoop,\ntogether with his stays, gown, and petticoat, wrapped his lappets\nabout his head by way of nightcap, and wore his domino as a loose\nmorning-dress; his grizzled locks hung down about his lack-lustre\neyes and tawny neck, in all the disorder of negligence; his gray beard\nbristled about half-an-inch through the remains of the paint with\nwhich his visage had been bedaubed, and every feature of his face was\nlengthened to the most ridiculous expression of grief and dismay.\n\nSeeing Peregrine come in, he started up in a sort of frantic ecstasy,\nand, running towards him with open arms, no sooner perceived the woeful\nappearance into which our hero had modelled his physiognomy, than he\nstopped short all of a sudden, and the joy which had begun to take\npossession of his heart was in a moment dispelled by the most rueful\npresages; so that he stood in a most ludicrous posture of dejection,\nlike a malefactor at the Old Bailey, when sentence is about to be\npronounced. Pickle, taking him by the hand, heaved a profound sigh; and\nafter having protested that he was extremely mortified at being pitched\nupon as the messenger of bad news, told him, with an air of sympathy and\ninfinite concern, that the French court, having discovered his sex, had\nresolved, in consideration of the outrageous indignity he offered\nin public to a prince of the blood, to detain him in the Bastille a\nprisoner for life; and that this sentence was a mitigation obtained by\nthe importunities of the British ambassador, the punishment ordained by\nlaw being no other than breaking alive upon the wheel.\n\nThese tidings aggravated the horrors of the painter to such a degree\nthat he roared aloud, and skipped about the room in all the extravagance\nof distraction, taking God and man to witness, that he would rather\nsuffer immediate death than endure one year's imprisonment in such a\nhideous place; and cursing the hour of his birth, and the moment on\nwhich he departed from his own country. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor my own part,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his\ntormentor, in a hypocritical tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was obliged to swallow the bitter\npill of making submission to the prince, who, as I had not presumed to\nstrike him, received acknowledgments, in consequence of which I shall\nbe this day set at liberty; and there is even one expedient left for the\nrecovery of your freedom--it is, I own, a disagreeable remedy, but one\nhad better undergo a little mortification than be for ever wretched.\nBesides, upon second thoughts, I begin to imagine that you will not for\nsuch a trifle sacrifice yourself to the unceasing horrors of a dungeon;\nespecially as your condescension will in all probability be attended\nwith advantages which you could not otherwise enjoy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pallet,\ninterrupting him with great eagerness, begged for the love of God that\nhe would no longer keep him in the torture of suspense, but mention\nthat same remedy, which he was resolved to follow, let it be ever so\nunpalatable.\n\nPeregrine, having thus played upon his passions of fear and hope,\nanswered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat as the offence was committed in the habit of a woman,\nwhich was a disguise unworthy of the other sex, the French court was of\nopinion that the delinquent should be reduced to the neuter gender; so\nthat there was no alternative at his own option, by which he had it in\nhis power to regain immediate freedom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the painter, in\ndespair, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecome a singer? Gadzooks! and the devil and all that! I'll\nrather be still where I am, and let myself be devoured by vermin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then\nthrusting out his throat--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere is my windpipe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe so good,\nmy dear friend, as to give it a slice or two: if you don't, I shall\none of these days be found dangling in my garters. What an unfortunate\nrascal I am! What a blockhead, and a beast, and a fool, was I to trust\nmyself among such a barbarous ruffian race! Lord forgive you, Mr.\nPickle, for having been the immediate cause of my disaster. If you had\nstood by me from the beginning, according to your promise, I should not\nhave been teased by that coxcomb who has brought me to this pass. And\nwhy did I put on this d--d unlucky dress? Lord curse that chattering\nJezebel of a landlady, who advised such a preposterous disguise!--a\ndisguise which has not only brought me to this pass, but also rendered\nme abominable to myself, and frightful to others; for when I this\nmorning signified to the turnkey that I wanted to be shaved, he looked\nat my beard with astonishment, and, crossing himself, muttered his Pater\nNoster, believing me, I suppose, to be a witch, or something worse. And\nHeaven confound that loathsome banquet of the ancients, which provoked\nme to drink too freely, that I might wash away the taste of that\naccursed sillikicaby.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOur young gentleman, having heard this lamentation to an end, excused\nhimself for his conduct by representing that he could not possibly\nforesee the disagreeable consequences that attended it; and in the\nmean time strenuously counselled him to submit to the terms of his\nenlargement. He observed that he was now arrived at that time of life\nwhen the lusts of the flesh should be entirely mortified within him, and\nhis greatest concern ought to be the of his soul, to which nothing could\nmore effectually contribute than the amputation which was proposed; that\nhis body, as well as his mind, would profit by the change; because he\nwould have no dangerous appetite to gratify, and no carnal thoughts to\ndivert him from the duties of his profession; and his voice, which was\nnaturally sweet, would improve to such a degree, that he would captivate\nthe ears of all the people of fashion and taste, and in a little time be\ncelebrated under the appellation of the English Senesino.\n\nThese arguments did not fail to make impression upon the painter, who\nnevertheless started two objections to his compliance; namely, the\ndisgrace of the punishment, and the dread of his wife. Pickle undertook\nto obviate these difficulties, by assuring him that the sentence would\nbe executed so privately as never to transpire: and that his wife could\nnot be so unconscionable, after so many years of cohabitation, as to\ntake exceptions to an expedient by which she would not only enjoy the\nconversation of her husband, but even the fruits of those talents which\nthe knife would so remarkably refine.\n\nPallet shook his hand at this last remonstrance, as if he thought it\nwould not be altogether convincing to his spouse, but yielded to the\nproposal, provided her consent could be obtained. Just as he signified\nthis condescension, the jailer entered, and addressing himself to the\nsupposed lady, expressed his satisfaction in having the honour to tell\nher that she was no longer a prisoner. As the painter did not understand\none word of what he said, Peregrine undertook the office of interpreter,\nand made his friend believe the jailer's speech was no other than an\nintimation that the ministry had sent a surgeon to execute what was\nproposed, and that the instruments and dressings were prepared in the\nnext room. Alarmed and terrified at this sudden appointment, he flew\nto the other end of the room, and, snatching up an earthen chamber-pot,\nwhich was the only offensive weapon in the place, put himself in a\nposture of defence, and with many oaths threatened to try the temper\nof the barber's skull, if he should presume to set his nose within the\napartment.\n\nThe jailer, who little expected such a reception, concluded that\nthe poor gentlewoman had actually lost her wits, and retreated with\nprecipitation, leaving the door open as he went out; upon which Pickle,\ngathering up the particulars of his dress with great despatch, crammed\nthem into Pallet's arms, and taking notice that now the coast was clear,\nexhorted him to follow his footsteps to the gate, where a hackney-coach\nstood for his reception. There being no time for hesitation, the painter\ntook his advice; and, without quitting the utensil, which in his hurry\nhe forgot to lay down, sallied out in the rear of our hero, with all the\nwildness of terror and impatience which may be reasonably supposed to\ntake possession of a man who flies from perpetual imprisonment. Such was\nthe tumult of his agitation, that his faculty of thinking was for the\npresent utterly overwhelmed, and he saw no object but his conductor,\nwhom he followed by a sort of instinctive impulse, without regarding the\nkeepers and sentinels, who, as he passed with his clothes under one arm,\nand his chamber-pot brandished above his head, were confounded, and even\ndismayed, at the strange apparition.\n\nDuring the whole course of this irruption, he ceased nor to cry, with\ngreat vociferation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDrive, coachman, drive, in the name of God!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n and the carriage had proceeded the length of a whole street before he\nmanifested the least sign of reflection, but stared like the Gorgon's\nhead, with his mouth wide open, and each particular hair crawling\nand twining like an animated serpent. At length, however, he began to\nrecover the use of his senses, and asked if Peregrine thought him\nnow out of all danger of being retaken. This unrelenting wag, not yet\nsatisfied with the affliction he imposed upon the sufferer, answered,\nwith an air of doubt and concern, that he hoped they would not be\novertaken, and prayed to God they might not be retarded by a stop\nof carriages. Pallet fervently joined in this supplication; and they\nadvanced a few yards farther, when the noise of a coach at full speed\nbehind them invaded their ears; and Pickle, having looked out of the\nwindow, withdrew his head in seeming confusion, and exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLord\nhave mercy upon us! I wish that may not be a guard sent after us.\nMethinks I saw the muzzle of a fusil sticking out of the coach.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The\npainter, hearing these tidings, that instant thrust himself half out\nat the window, with his helmet still in his hand, bellowing to the\ncoachman, as loud as he could roar, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDrive, d-- ye, dive to the gates\nof Jericho and the ends of the earth! Drive, you ragamuffin, you\nrascallion, you hell-hound! Drive us to the pit Of hell, rather than we\nshould be taken!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSuch a phantom could not pass without attracting the curiosity of the\npeople, who ran to their doors and windows, in order to behold this\nobject of admiration. With the same view, that coach, which was supposed\nto be in pursuit of him, stopped just as the windows of each happened to\nbe opposite; and Pallet, looking behind, and seeing three men standing\nupon the footboard armed with canes, which his fear converted into\nfusils, never doubted that his friend's suspicion was just, but, shaking\nhis Jordan at the imaginary guard, swore he would sooner die than part\nwith his precious ware. The owner of the coach, who was a nobleman of\nthe first quality, mistook him for some unhappy woman deprived of her\nsenses: and, ordering his coachman to proceed, convinced the fugitive,\nto his infinite joy, that this was no more than a false alarm. He was\nnot, for all that, freed from anxiety and trepidation; but our young\ngentleman, fearing his brain would not bear a repetition of the\nsame joke, permitted him to gain his own lodgings without further\nmolestation.\n\nHis landlady, meeting him on the stair, was so affected at his\nappearance, that she screamed aloud, and betook herself to flight; while\nhe, cursing her with greet bitterness, rushed into the apartment to\nthe doctor, who, instead of receiving him with cordial embraces, and\ncongratulating him upon his deliverance, gave evident signs of umbrage\nand discontent; and even plainly told him, he hoped to have heard that\nhe and Mr. Pickle had acted the glorious part of Cato; an event which\nwould have laid the foundation of such noble struggles, as could not\nfail to end in happiness and freedom; and that he had already made\nsome progress in an ode that would have immortalised their names, and\ninspired the flame of liberty in every honest breast. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nhe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would have proved, that great talents, and high sentiments of\nliberty, do reciprocally produce and assist each other; and illustrated\nmy assertions with such notes and quotations from the Greek writers, as\nwould have opened the eyes of the most blind and unthinking, and touched\nthe most callous and obdurate heart. 'O fool! to think the man, whose\nample mind must grasp whatever yonder stars survey'--Pray, Mr. Pellet,\nwhat is your opinion of that image of the mind's grasping the whole\nuniverse? For my own part, I can't help thinking it the most happy\nconception that ever entered my imagination.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe painter, who was not such a flaming enthusiast in the cause of\nliberty, could not brook the doctor's reflections, which he thought\nsavoured a little too much of indifference and deficiency in point of\nprivate friendship; and therefore seized the present opportunity of\nmortifying his pride, by observing, that the image was, without all\ndoubt, very grand and magnificent; but that he had been obliged for the\nidea to Mr. Bayes in \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Rehearsal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d who values himself upon the same\nfigure, conveyed in these words, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut all these clouds, when by the eye\nof reason grasp'd, etc.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Upon any other occasion, the painter would\nhave triumphed greatly upon this detection; but such was the flutter and\nconfusion of his spirits, under the apprehension of being retaken, that,\nwithout further communication, he retreated to his own room, in order to\nresume his own dress, which he hoped would alter his appearance in such\na manner as to baffle all search and examination; while the physician\nremained ashamed and abashed, to find himself convinced of bombast by\na person of such contemptible talents. He was offended at this proof\nof his memory, and so much enraged at his presumption in exhibiting\nit, that he could never forgive his want of reverence, and took every\nopportunity of exposing his ignorance and folly in the sequel. Indeed,\nthe ties of private affection were too weak to engage the heart of this\nrepublican, whose zeal for the community had entirely swallowed up\nhis concern for individuals. He looked upon particular friendship as a\npassion unworthy of his ample soul, and was a professed admirer of L.\nManlius, Junius Brutus, and those later patriots of the same name,\nwho shut their ears against the cries of nature, and resisted all the\ndictates of gratitude and humanity.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\n\n\nPallet conceives a hearty Contempt for his Fellow-traveller, and\nattaches himself to Pickle, who, nevertheless, persecutes him with his\nmischievous Talent upon the Road to Flanders.\n\n\nIn the mean time, his companion, having employed divers pailfuls of\nwater in cleansing himself from the squalor of jail, submitted his face\nto the barber, tinged his eye-brows with a sable hue, and, being dressed\nin his own clothes, ventured to visit Peregrine, who was still under the\nhands of his valet-de-chambre, and who gave him to understand that his\nescape had been connived at, and that the condition of their deliverance\nwas their departure from Paris in three days.\n\nThe painter was transported with joy, when he learned that he ran\nno risk of being retaken, and, far from repining at the terms of his\nenlargement, would have willingly set out on his return to England that\nsame afternoon; for the Bastille had made such an impression upon him,\nthat he started at the sound of every coach, and turned pale at the\nsight of a French soldier. In the fulness of his heart, he complained of\nthe doctor's indifference, and related what had passed at their meeting\nwith evident marks of resentment and disrespect; which were not at all\ndiminished, when Jolter informed him of the physician's behaviour\nwhen he sent for him, to confer about the means of abridging their\nconfinement. Pickle himself was incensed at his want of bowels; and,\nperceiving how much he had sank in the opinion of his fellow-traveller,\nresolved to encourage these sentiments of disgust, and occasionally\nfoment the division to a downright quarrel, which he foresaw would\nproduce some diversion, and perhaps expose the poet's character in\nsuch a light, as would effectually punish him for his arrogance and\nbarbarity. With this view, he leveled several satirical jokes at the\ndoctor's pedantry and want of taste, which had appeared so conspicuous\nin the quotation he had got by heart, from ancient authors; in his\naffected disdain of the best pictures of the world, which, had he been\nendowed with the least share of discernment, he could not have beheld\nwith such insensibility; and, lastly, in his ridiculous banquet, which\nnone but an egregious coxcomb, devoid of all elegance and sense, would\nhave prepared, or presented to rational beings. In a word, our young\ngentleman played the artillery of his wit against him with such success,\nthat the painter seemed to wake from a dream, and went home with the\nmost hearty contempt for the person he had formerly adored.\n\nInstead of using the privilege of a friend, to enter his apartment\nwithout ceremony, he sent in his servant with a message, importing,\nthat he intended to set out from Paris the next day, in company with\nMr. Pickle; and desiring to know whether or not he was, or would be,\nprepared for the journey. The doctor, struck with the manner as well\nas the matter of this intimation, went immediately to Pallet's room and\ndemanded to know the cause of such a sudden determination without his\nprivity or concurrence; and when he understood the necessity of their\naffairs, rather than travel by himself, he ordered his baggage to be\npacked up, and signified his readiness to conform to the emergency of\nthe case; though he was not at all pleased with the cavalier behaviour\nof Pallet, to whom he threw out some hints on his own importance, and\nthe immensity of his condescension in favouring him with such marks of\nregard. But by this time these insinuations had lost their effect upon\nthe painter who told him, with an arch sneer, that he did not at all\nquestion his learning and abilities, and particularly his skill in\ncookery, which he should never forget while his palate retained its\nfunction; but nevertheless advised him, for the sake of the degenerate\neaters of these days, to spare a little of his sal ammoniac in the next\nsillykicaby he should prepare; and abate somewhat of the devil's dung,\nwhich he had so plentifully crammed into the roasted fowls, unless he\nhad a mind to convert his guests into patients, with a view of licking\nhimself whole for the expense of the entertainment.\n\nThe physician, nettled at these sarcasms, eyed him with a look of\nindignation and disdain; and, being, unwilling to express himself in\nEnglish, lest, in the course of the altercation, Pallet should be so\nmuch irritated as to depart without him, he vented his anger in Greek.\nThe painter, though by the sound he supposed this quotation to be Greek,\ncomplimented his friend upon his knowledge in the Welsh language, and\nfound means to rally him quite out of temper; so that he retired to\nhis own chamber in the utmost wrath and mortification, and left his\nantagonist exulting over the victory he had won.\n\nWhile these things passed between these originals, Peregrine waited\nupon the ambassador, whom he thanked for his kind interposition,\nacknowledging the indiscretion of his own conduct with such appearance\nof conviction and promises of reformation, that his excellency freely\nforgave him for all the trouble he had been put to on his account,\nfortified him with sensible advices and, assuring him of his continual\nfavour and friendship, gave him at parting, letters of introduction to\nseveral persons of quality belonging to the British court.\n\nThus distinguished, our young gentleman took leave of all his French\nacquaintance, and spent the evening with some of those who had enjoyed\nthe greatest share of his intimacy and confidence; while Jolter\nsuperintended his domestic concerns, and with infinite joy bespoke a\npost-chaise and horse, in order to convey him from a place where\nhe lived in continual apprehension of suffering by the dangerous\ndisposition of his pupil. Everything being adjusted according to their\nplan, they and their fellow-travellers next day dined together, and\nabout four in the afternoon took their departure in two chaises,\nescorted by the valet-de-chambre, Pipes, and the doctor's lacquey on\nhorseback, well furnished with arms and ammunition, in case of being\nattacked by robbers on the road.\n\nIt was about eleven o'clock at night when they arrived at Senlis, which\nwas the place at which they proposed to lodge, and where they were\nobliged to knock up the people of the inn, before they could have\ntheir supper prepared. All the provision in the house was but barely\nsufficient to furnish one indifferent meal: however, the painter\nconsoled himself for the quantity with the quality of the dishes, one of\nwhich was a fricassee of rabbit, a preparation that he valued above\nall the dainties that ever smoked upon the table of the sumptuous\nHeliogabalus.\n\nHe had no sooner expressed himself to this effect, than our hero,\nwho almost incessantly laying traps for diversion at his neighbour's\nexpense, laid hold on the declaration; and, recollecting the story of\nScipio and the muleteer in Gil Blas, resolved to perpetrate a joke upon\nthe stomach of Pallet, which seemed well disposed to a hearty supper.\nHe, accordingly, digested his plan; and the company being seated at\ntable, affected to stare with peculiar eagerness at the painter, who had\nhelped himself to a large portion of the fricassee, and began to swallow\nit with infinite relish. Pallet, notwithstanding the keenness of his\nappetite, could not help taking notice of Pickle's demeanour; and,\nmaking a short pause in the exercise of his grinders, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are\nsurprised,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto see me make so much despatch; but I was\nextremely hungry, and this is one of the best fricassees I ever tasted:\nthe French are very expert in these dishes, that I must allow; and, upon\nmy conscience, I would never desire to eat a more delicate rabbit than\nthis that lies upon my plate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPeregrine made no other reply to this encomium, than the repetition of\nthe word rabbit, with a note of admiration, and such a significant shake\nof the head, as effectually alarmed the other, who instantly suspended\nthe action of his jaws, and, with the morsel half chewed in his mouth,\nstared round him with a certain stolidity of apprehension, which\nis easier conceived than described; until his eyes encountered the\ncountenance of Thomas Pipes, who, being instructed, and posted opposite\nto him for the occasion, exhibited an arch grin, that completed the\npainter's disorder. Afraid of swallowing his mouthful, and ashamed to\ndispose of it any other way, he sat some time in a most distressed state\nof suspense; and being questioned by Mr. Jolter touching his calamity,\nmade a violent effort of the muscles of his gullet, which with\ndifficulty performed their office; and then, with great confusion and\nconcern, asked if Mr. Pickle suspected the rabbit's identity. The young\ngentleman, assuming a mysterious air, pretended ignorance of the matter,\nobserving that he was apt to suspect all dishes of that kind, since he\nhad been informed of the tricks which were commonly played at inns\nin France, Italy, and Spain; and recounted three passage in Gil Blas,\nwhich we have hinted it above, saying, he did not pretend to be a\nconnoisseur in animals, but the legs of the creature which composed that\ndiet which composed the fricassee, did not, in his opinion, resemble\nthose of the rabbits he had usually seen. This observation had an\nevident effect upon the features of the painter, who, with certain signs\nof loathing and astonishment, exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLord Jesus!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and appealed to\nPipes for the discovery of the truth by asking if he knew anything\nof the affair. Tom very gravely replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009che did suppose the food\nwas wholesome enough, for he had seen the skin and feet of a special\nram-cat, new flayed, hanging upon the door of a small pantry adjoining\nto the kitchen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBefore this sentence was uttered, Pallet's belly seemed to move in\ncontact with his back-bone, his colour changed, no part but the whites\nof his eyes were to be seen, he dropped his lower jaw, and, fixing his\nhands in his sides, retched with such convulsive agonies, as amazed and\ndisconcerted the whole company: and what augmented his disorder, was\nthe tenacious retention of the stomach, which absolutely refused to part\nwith its contents, notwithstanding all the energy of his abhorrence,\nwhich threw him into a cold sweat, and almost into a swoon.\n\nPickle, alarmed at his condition, assured him it was a genuine rabbit,\nand that he had tutored Pipes to say otherwise for the joke's sake.\nBut this confession he considered as a friendly artifice of Pickle's\ncompassion, and therefore it had little effect upon his constitution. By\nthe assistance, however, of a large bumper of brandy, his spirits were\nrecruited, and his recollection so far recovered, that he was able to\ndeclare, with divers contortions of face, that the dish had a rankness\nof taste, which he had imparted partly to the nature of the French\ncovey, and partly to the composition of their sauces; then he inveighed\nagainst the infamous practices of French publicans, attributing\nsuch imposition to their oppressive government, which kept them so\nnecessitous, that they were tempted to exercise all manner of knavery\nupon their unwary guests.\n\nJolter, who could not find in his heart to let slip any opportunity of\nspeaking in favour of the French, told him, that he was a very great\nstranger to their police; else he would know, that if, upon information\nto the magistrate, it should appear that any traveller, native or\nforeigner, had been imposed upon or ill-treated by a publican, the\noffender would be immediately obliged to shut up his house; and, if his\nbehaviour had been notorious, he himself would be sent to the galleys,\nwithout the least hesitation: \u00e2\u0080\u009cand as for the dish which has been made\nthe occasion of your present disorder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will take upon me\nto affirm it was prepared of a genuine rabbit, which was skinned in my\npresence; and, in confirmation of what I assert, though such fricassees\nare not the favourites of my taste, I will eat a part of this without\nscruple.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he swallowed several mouthfuls of the questioned coney, and\nPallet seemed to eye it again with inclination; nay, he even resumed his\nknife and fork; and being just on the point of applying them, was seized\nwith another qualm of apprehension, that broke out in an exclamation of,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter all, Mr. Jolter, if it should be a real ram-cat? Lord have mercy\nupon me! here is one of the claws.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With these words he presented the\ntip of a toe, of which Pipes had snipped off five or six from a duck\nthat was roasted, and purposely scattered them in the fricassee: and\nthe governor could not behold this testimonial without symptoms of\nuneasiness and remorse; so that he and the painter sat silenced and\nabashed, and made faces at each other, while the physician, who hated\nthem both, exulted over their affliction, bidding them be of good cheer,\nand proceed with their meal; for he was ready to demonstrate, that\nthe flesh of a cat was as nourishing and delicious as veal or mutton,\nprovided they could prove that the said cat was not of the boar kind,\nand had fed chiefly on vegetable diet, or even confined its carnivorous\nappetite to rats and mice, which he affirmed to be dainties of exquisite\ntaste and flavour. He said, it was a vulgar mistake to think that\nall flesh-devouring creatures were unfit to be eaten: witness the\nconsumption of swine and ducks, animals that delight in carnage as\nwell as fish, and prey upon each other, and feed on bait and carrion;\ntogether with the demand for bear, of which the best hams in the world\nare made. He then observed that the negroes on the coast of Guinea, who\nare healthy and vigorous people, prefer cats and dogs to all other\nfare; and mentioned from history several sieges, during which the\ninhabitants, who were blocked up, lived upon these animals, and had\nrecourse even to human flesh, which, to his certain knowledge, was in\nall respects preferable to pork; for, in the course of his studies, he\nhad, for the experiment's sake, eaten a steak cut from the buttock of a\nperson who had been hanged.\n\nThis dissertation, far from composing, increased the disquiet in\nthe stomachs of the governor and painter, who, hearing the last\nillustration, turned their eyes upon the orator, at the same instant,\nwith looks of horror and disgust; and the one muttering the term\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ccannibal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the other pronouncing the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cabomination,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they rose\nfrom table in a great hurry, and running towards another apartment,\njostled with such violence in the passage, that both were overturned\nby the shock, which also contributed to the effect of their nausea that\nmutually defiled them as they lay.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX.\n\n\n\nNor is the Physician sacred from his Ridicule--They reach Arras, where\nour Adventurer engages in Play with two French Officers, who, next\nMorning, give the Landlord an interesting Proof of their Importance.\n\n\nThe doctor remained sullen and dejected during the whole journey: not\nbut that he attempted to recover his importance by haranguing upon the\nRoman highways, when Mr. Jolter desired the company to take notice of\nthe fine pavement upon which they travelled from Paris into Flanders;\nbut Pallet, who thought he had now gained the ascendency over the\nphysician, exerted himself in maintaining the superiority he had\nacquired, by venting various sarcasms upon his self-conceit and\naffectation of learning, and even tittering puns and conundrums upon the\nremarks which the republican retailed. When he talked of the Flaminian\nWay, the painter questioned if it was a better pavement than the\nFleminian Way on which they travelled: and the doctor having observed,\nthat this road was made for the convenience of drawing the French\nartillery into Flanders, which was often the seat of war, his competitor\nin wit replied, with infinite vivacity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are more great guns than\nthe French king knows of drawn along this causeway, doctor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEncouraged by the success of these efforts, which tickled the\nimagination of Jolter, and drew smiles (as he imagined) of approbation\nfrom our hero, he sported in many other equivoques of the same nature;\nand at dinner, told the physician, that he was like the root of the\ntongue, as being cursedly down in the mouth.\n\nBy this time, such was the animosity subsisting between these quondam\nfriends, that they never conversed together, except with a view\nof exposing each other to the ridicule or contempt of their\nfellow-travellers. The doctor was at great pains to point out the folly\nand ignorance of Pallet in private to Peregrine, who was often conjured\nin the same manner by the painter, to take notice of the physician's\nwant of manners and taste. Pickle pretended to acquiesce in the truth\nof their mutual severity, which, indeed, was extremely just; and by\nmalicious insinuations blew up their contention, with a view of bringing\nit to open hostility. But both seemed so averse to deeds of mortal\npurpose, that for a long time his arts were baffled, and he could\nnot spirit them up to any pitch of resentment higher than scurrilous\nrepartee.\n\nBefore they reached Arras, the city gates were shut, so that they\nwere obliged to take up their lodgings at an indifferent house in the\nsuburbs, where they found a couple of French officers, who had also rode\npost from Paris so far on their way to Lisle. These gentlemen were about\nthe age of thirty, and their deportment distinguished by such an air\nof insolence, as disgusted our hero, who, nevertheless, accosted them\npolitely in the yard, and proposed that they should sup together. They\nthanked him for the honour of his invitation, which, however, they\ndeclined upon pretence of having ordered something for themselves;\nbut promised to wait upon him and his company immediately after their\nrepast.\n\nThis they accordingly performed; and, after having drunk a few glasses\nof Burgundy, one of them asked, if the young gentleman would, for\npastime, take a hand at quadrille. Peregrine easily divined the meaning\nof this proposal, which was made with no other view than that of\nfleecing him and his fellow-travellers; for he well knew to what shifts\na subaltern in the French service is reduced, in order to maintain the\nappearance of a gentleman, and had reason to believe that most of them\nwere sharpers from their youth: but, as he depended a good deal upon his\nown penetration and address, he gratified the stranger's desire; and a\nparty was instantly formed of the painter, the physician, the proposer,\nand himself, the other officer having professed himself utterly ignorant\nof the game; in the course of the play, he took his station at the back\nof Pickle's chair, which was opposite to his friend, on pretence of\namusing himself with seeing his manner of conducting the cards. The\nyouth was not such a novice but that he perceived the design of this\npalpable piece of behaviour, which, notwithstanding, he overlooked for\nthe present, with a view of flattering their hopes in the beginning,\nthat they might be the more effectually punished by their disappointment\nin the end.\n\nThe game was scarce begun, when, by the reflection of a glass, he\ndiscerned the officer at his back making signs to his companion, who,\nby preconcerted gestures, was perfectly informed of the contents of\nPeregrine's hand, and, of consequence, fortunate in the course of play.\nThus they were allowed to enjoy the fruits of their dexterity, until\ntheir money amounted to some louis; when our young gentleman, thinking\nit high time to do himself justice, signified in very polite terms to\nthe gentleman who stood behind him, that he could never play with ease\nand deliberation when he was overlooked by any bystander, and begged\nthat he would have the goodness to be seated.\n\nAs this was a remonstrance which the stranger could not, with any show\nof breeding, resist, he asked pardon, and retired to the chair of the\nphysician, who frankly told him, that it was not the fashion of his\ncountry for one to submit his hand to the perusal of a spectator; and\nwhen, in consequence of this rebuff, he wanted to quarter himself upon\nthe painter, he was refused by a wave of the hand, and shake of the\nhead, with an exclamation of pardonnez moi; which was repeated with such\nemphasis, as discomposed this effrontery; and he found himself obliged\nto sit down in a state of mortification.\n\nThe odds being thus removed, fortune proceeded in her usual channel;\nand though the Frenchman, deprived of his ally, endeavoured to practise\ndivers strokes of finesse, the rest of the company observed him with\nsuch vigilance and caution, as baffled all his attempts, and in a very\nlittle time he was compelled to part with his winning: but, having\nengaged in the match with an intention of taking all advantages,\nwhether fair or unfair, that his superior skill should give him over the\nEnglishman, the money was not refunded without a thousand disputes, in\nthe course of which he essayed to intimidate his antagonist with high\nwords, which were retorted by our hero with such interest as convinced\nhim that he had mistaken his man, and persuaded him to make his retreat\nin quiet. Indeed, it was not without cause that they repined at the\nbad success of their enterprise; because, in all likelihood, they had\nnothing to depend upon for the present but their own industry, and knew\nnot how to defray their expenses on the road, except by some acquisition\nof this kind.\n\nNext morning they rose at daybreak, and resolving to anticipate their\nfellow-lodgers, bespoke post-horses as soon as they could be admitted\ninto the city; so that, when our company appeared, their beasts were\nready in the yard, and they only waited to discuss the bill, which they\nhad ordered to be made out. The landlord of the inn presented his carte\nwith fear and trembling to one of those ferocious cavaliers, who no\nsooner cast his eye upon the sum total, than he discharged a volley of\ndreadful oaths, and asked if the king's officers were to be treated in\nthat manner? The poor publican protested, with great humility, that he\nhad the utmost respect for his majesty, and everything that belonged to\nhim; and that, far from consulting his own interest, all that he desired\nwas, to be barely indemnified for the expense of their lodging.\n\nThis condescension seemed to have no other effect than that of\nencouraging their arrogance. They swore his extortion should be\nexplained to the commandant of the town, who would, by making him a\npublic example, teach other innkeepers how to behave towards men of\nhonour; and threatened with such confidence of indignation, that the\nwretched landlord, dreading the consequence of their wrath, implored\npardon in the most abject manner, begging, with many supplications, that\nhe might have the pleasure of lodging them at his own charge. This was\na favour which he with great difficulty obtained: they chid him severely\nfor his imposition; exhorted him to have more regard for his own\nconscience, as well as to the convenience of his guests; and, cautioning\nhim in particular touching his behaviour to the gentlemen of the army,\nmounted their horses, and rode off in great state, leaving him very\nthankful for having so successfully appeased the choler of two officers,\nwho wanted either inclination or ability to pay their bill; for\nexperience had taught him to be apprehensive of all such travellers, who\ncommonly lay the landlord under contribution, by way of atonement\nfor the extravagance of his demands, even after he has professed his\nwillingness to entertain them on their own terms.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\n\n\nPeregrine moralizes upon their Behaviour, which is condemned by the\nDoctor, and defended by the Governor--They arrive in safety at Lisle,\ndine at an Ordinary, visit the Citadel--The Physician quarrels with a\nNorth Briton, who is put in Arrest.\n\n\nThese honourable adventurers being gone, Peregrine, who was present\nduring the transaction, informed himself of the particulars from the\nmouth of the innkeeper himself, who took Heaven and the saints to\nwitness, that he should have been a loser by their custom, even if\nthe bill had been paid: because he was on his guard against their\nobjections, and had charged every article at an under price: but such\nwas the authority of officers in France, that he durst not dispute\nthe least circumstance of their will; for, had the case come under the\ncognizance of the magistrate, he must, in course, have suffered by the\nmaxims of their government, which never fail to abet the oppression\nof the army; and, besides, run the risk of incurring their future\nresentment, which would be sufficient to ruin him from top to bottom.\n\nOur hero boiled with indignation at this instance of injustice and\narbitrary power; and, turning to his governor, asked, if this too was\na proof of the happiness enjoyed by the French people. Jolter replied,\nthat every human constitution must, in some things, be imperfect and\nowned, that in this kingdom, gentlemen were more countenanced than\nthe vulgar, because it was to be presumed that their own sentiments\nof honour and superior qualifications would entitle them to this\npre-eminence, which had also a retrospective view to the merit of their\nancestors, in consideration of which they were at first ennobled; but he\naffirmed, that the innkeeper had misrepresented the magistracy, which,\nin France, never failed to punish flagrant outrages and abuse, without\nrespect of persons.\n\nThe painter approved of the wisdom of the French government, in bridling\nthe insolence of the mob, by which, he assured them, he had often\nsuffered in his own person; having been often bespattered by\nhackney-coachmen, jostled by draymen and porters, and reviled in the\nmost opprobrious terms by the watermen of London, where he had once lost\nhis bag and a considerable quantity of hair, which had been cut off\nby some rascal in his passage through Ludgate, during the Lord Mayor's\nprocession. On the other hand, the doctor with great warmth alleged,\nthat those officers ought to suffer death, or banishment at least, for\nhaving plundered the people in this manner, which was so impudent\nand barefaced, as plainly to prove they were certain of escaping\nwith impunity, and that they were old offenders in the same degree of\ndelinquency. He said, that the greatest man in Athens would have been\ncondemned to perpetual exile, and seen his estate confiscated for public\nuse, had he dared in such a licentious manner to violate the rights of\na fellow-citizen; and as for the little affronts to which a man may\nbe subject from the petulance of the multitude, he looked upon them as\nglorious indications of liberty, which ought not to be repressed, and\nwould at any time rejoice to find himself overthrown in a kennel by the\ninsolence of a son of freedom, even though the fall should cost him a\nlimb; adding, by way of illustration, that the greatest pleasure he ever\nenjoyed was in seeing a dustman wilfully overturn a gentleman's coach,\nin which two ladies were bruised, even to the danger of their lives.\nPallet, shocked at the extravagance of this declaration, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf that be the\ncase,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish you may see every bone in your body broke by the\nfirst carman you meet in the streets of London.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis argument being discussed, and the reckoning discharged without any\ndeduction, although the landlord, in stating the articles, had an eye\nto the loss he had sustained by his own countrymen, they departed\nfrom Arras, and arrived in safety at Lisle, about two o'clock in the\nafternoon.\n\nThey had scarce taken possession of their lodgings, in a large hotel in\nthe Grande Place, when the innkeeper gave them to understand, that\nhe kept an ordinary below, which was frequented by several English\ngentlemen who resided in town, and that dinner was then set upon\nthe table. Peregrine, who seized all opportunities of observing new\ncharacters, persuaded his company to dine in public; and they were\naccordingly conducted to the place, where they found a mixture of Scotch\nand Dutch officers, who had come from Holland to learn their exercises\nat the academy, and some gentlemen in the French service, who were upon\ngarrison duty in the citadel. Among these last was a person about the\nage of fifty, of a remarkably genteel air and polite address, dignified\nwith a Maltese cross, and distinguished by the particular veneration of\nall those who knew him. When he understood that Pickle and his friends\nwere travellers, he accosted the youth in English, which he spoke\ntolerably well; and, as they were strangers, offered to attend them in\nthe afternoon to all the places worth seeing in Lisle. Our hero thanked\nhim for his excess of politeness, which, he said, was peculiar to the\nFrench nation; and, struck with his engaging appearance, industriously\ncourted his conversation, in the course of which he learned that this\nchevalier was a man of good sense and great experience, that he was\nperfectly well acquainted with the greatest part of Europe, had lived\nsome years in England, and was no stranger to the constitution and\ngenius of that people.\n\nHaving dined, and drunk to the healths of the English and French kings,\ntwo fiacres were called, in one of which the knight, with one of his\ncompanions, the governor, and Peregrine seated themselves, the other\nbeing occupied by the physician, Pallet, and two Scottish officers,\nwho proposed to accompany them in their circuit. The first place they\nvisited was the citadel, round the ramparts of which they walked,\nunder the conduct of the knight, who explained with great accuracy the\nintention of every particular fortification belonging to that seemingly\nimpregnable fortress; and, when they had satisfied their curiosity,\ntook coach again, in order to view the arsenal, which stands in another\nquarter of the town; but, just as Pickle's carriage had crossed the\npromenade, he heard his own name bawled aloud by the painter; and,\nordering the fiacre to stop, saw Pallet, with one half of his body\nthrust out at the window of the other coach, crying, with a terrified\nlook, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Pickle, Mr. Pickle, the for the love of God halt, and prevent\nbloodshed, else here will be carnage and cutting of throats.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Peregrine,\nsurprised at this exclamation, immediately alighted, and, advancing to\nthe other vehicle, found one of their military companions standing upon\nthe ground, at the farther side of the coach, with his sword drawn, and\nfury in his countenance; and the physician, with a quivering lip, and\nhaggard aspect, struggling with the other, who had interposed in the\nquarrel, and detained him in his place.\n\nOur young gentleman, upon inquiry, found that this animosity had sprung\nfrom a dispute that happened upon the ramparts, touching the strength of\nthe fortification, which the doctor, according to custom, undervalued,\nbecause it was a modern work; saying, that by the help of the military\nengines used among the ancients, and a few thousands of pioneers, he\nwould engage to take it in less than ten days after he should sit down\nbefore it. The North Briton, who was as great a pedant as the physician,\nhaving studied fortification, and made himself master of Caesar's\nCommentaries and Polybius, with the observations of Folard, affirmed,\nthat all the methods of besieging practised by the ancients would be\nutterly ineffectual against such a plan as that of the citadel of Lisle;\nand began to compare the vineae, aggeres, arietes, scorpiones, and\ncatapultae of the Romans, with the trenches, mines, batteries, and\nmortars used in the present art of war. The republican, finding himself\nattacked upon what he thought his strong side, summoned all his learning\nto his aid; and, describing the famous siege of Plateae, happened to\nmisquote a passage of Thucydides, in which he was corrected by the\nother, who, having been educated for the church, was also a connoisseur\nin the Greek language. The doctor, incensed at being detected in such\na blunder in the presence of Pallet, who, he knew, would promulgate his\nshame, told the officer, with great arrogance, that his objection was\nfrivolous, and that he must not pretend to dispute on these matters\nwith one who had considered them with the utmost accuracy and care. His\nantagonist, piqued at this supercilious insinuation, replied with\ngreat heat, that for aught he knew, the doctor might be a very expert\napothecary, but that in the art of war, and knowledge of the Greek\ntongue, he was no other than an ignorant pretender.\n\nThis asseveration produced an answer full of virulence, including a\nnational reflection upon the soldier's country; and the contention rose\nto mutual abuse, when it was suppressed by the admonitions of the other\ntwo, who begged they would not expose themselves in a strange place,\nbut behave themselves like fellow-subjects and friends. They accordingly\nceased reviling each other, and the affair was seemingly forgot;\nbut after they had resumed their places in the coach, the painter\nunfortunately asked the meaning of the word tortise, which he had\nheard them mention among the Roman implements of war. This question was\nanswered by the physician, who described the nature of this expedient\nso little to the satisfaction of the officer, that he contradicted him\nflatly in the midst of his explanation; a circumstance which provoked\nthe republican to such a degree, that, in the temerity of his passion,\nhe uttered the epithet, \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpertinent scoundrel;\u00e2\u0080\u009d which was no sooner\npronounced than the Caledonian made manual application to his nose, and,\nleaping out of the coach, stood waiting for him on the plain; while he,\nthe physician, made feeble efforts to join him, being easily retained\nby the other soldier; and Pallet, dreading the consequence in which he\nhimself might be involved, bellowed aloud for prevention.\n\nOur hero endeavoured to quiet the commotion by representing to the Scot\nthat he had already taken satisfaction for the injury he had received,\nand telling the doctor that he had deserved the chastisement which was\ninflicted upon him; but the officer, encouraged perhaps by the confusion\nof his antagonist, insisted upon his asking pardon for what he had said;\nand the doctor, believing himself under the protection of his friend\nPickle, far from agreeing to such concession, breathed nothing but\ndefiance and revenge; so that the chevalier, in order to prevent\nmischief, put the soldier under arrest, and sent him to his lodgings,\nunder the care of the other French gentleman and his own companion; they\nbeing also accompanied by Mr. Jolter, who, having formerly seen all the\ncuriosities of Lisle, willingly surrendered his place to the physician.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\n\n\nPickle engages with a Knight of Malta, in a Conversation upon the\nEnglish Stage, which is followed by a Dissertation on the Theatres of\nthe Ancients, by the Doctor.\n\n\nThe rest of the company proceeded to the arsenal, which having viewed,\ntogether with some remarkable churches, they, in their return, went to\nthe comedy, and saw the Cid of Corneille tolerably well represented. In\nconsequence of this entertainment, the discourse at supper turned upon\ndramatic performances; and all the objections of Monsieur Scudery to\nthe piece they had seen acted, together with the decision of the French\nAcademy, were canvassed and discussed. The knight was a man of letters\nand taste, and particularly well acquainted with the state of the\nEnglish stage; so that when the painter boldly pronounced sentence\nagainst the French manner of acting, on the strength of having\nfrequented a Covent Garden club of critics, and been often admitted, by\nvirtue of an order, into the pit; a comparison immediately ensued,\nnot between the authors, but the actors of both nations, to whom\nthe chevalier and Peregrine were no strangers. Our hero, like a good\nEnglishman, made no scruple of giving the preference to the performers\nof his own country, who, he alleged, obeyed the genuine impulses of\nnature, in exhibiting the passions of the human mind; and entered so\nwarmly into the spirit of their several parts, that they often fancied\nthemselves the very heroes they represented; whereas, the action of\nthe Parisian players, even in their most interesting characters, was\ngenerally such an extravagance in voice and gesture, as is nowhere to\nbe observed but on the stage. To illustrate this assertion, he availed\nhimself of his talent, and mimicked the manner and voice of all the\nprincipal performers, male and female, belonging to the French comedy,\nto the admiration of the chevalier, who, having complimented him upon\nthis surprising modulation, begged leave to dissent in some particulars\nfrom the opinion he had avowed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat you have good actors in England,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit would be unjust\nand absurd in me to deny; your theatre is adorned by one woman, whose\nsensibility and sweetness of voice is such as I have never observed on\nany other stage; she has besides, an elegance of person and expression\nof features, that wonderfully adapt her for the most engaging characters\nof your best plays; and I must freely own that I have been as highly\ndelighted and as deeply affected by a Monimia and Belvidera at London,\nas ever I was by Cornelia and Cleopatra at Paris. Your favourite actor\nis a surprising genius. You can, moreover, boast of several comic actors\nwho are perfect masters of buffoonery and grimace; though, to be free\nwith you, I think in these qualifications you are excelled by the\nplayers of Amsterdam. Yet one of your graciosos I cannot admire, in all\nthe characters he assumes. His utterance is a continual sing-song,\nlike the chanting of vespers; and his action resembles that of heaving\nballast into the hold of a ship. In his outward deportment he seems to\nhave confounded the ideas of insolence and the dignity of mien; acts the\ncrafty cool, designing Crookback, as a loud, shallow, blustering Hector;\nin the character of the mild patriot Brutus, loses all temper and\ndecorum; nay, so ridiculous is the behaviour of him and Cassius at their\ninterview, that, setting foot to foot, and grinning at each other,\nwith the aspect of two cobblers engaged, they thrust their left sides\ntogether, with repeated shoots, that the hilts of their swords may clash\nfor the entertainment of the audience; as if they were a couple of merry\nandrews, endeavouring to raise the laugh of the vulgar, on some scaffold\nof Bartholomew Fair. The despair of a great man, who falls a victim to\nthe infernal practices of a subtle traitor who enjoyed his confidence,\nthis English Aesopus represents, by beating his own forehead, and\nbeating like a bull; and, indeed, in almost all his most interesting\nscenes, performs such strange shakings of the head, and other antic\ngesticulations, that when I first saw him act, I imagined the poor man\nlaboured under the paralytical disorder, which is known by the name\nof St. Vitus's dance. In short, he seems to be a stranger to the more\nrefined sensations of the soul, consequently his expression is of the\nvulgar kind, and he must often sink under the idea of the poet; so that\nhe has recourse to such violence of affected agitation, as imposes upon\nthe undiscerning spectator; but to the eye of taste, evinces him a mere\nplayer of that class whom your admired Shakespeare justly compares to\nNature's journeyman tearing a passion to rags. Yet this man, in spite of\nall these absurdities, is an admirable Falstaff, exhibits the character\nof the eighth Henry to the life, is reasonably applauded in the Plain\nDealer, excels in the part of Sir John Brute, and would be equal to many\nhumorous situations in low comedy, which his pride will not allow him to\nundertake. I should not have been so severe upon this actor, had I not\nseen him extolled by his partisans with the most ridiculous and fulsome\nmanifestations of praise, even in those very circumstances wherein (as I\nhave observed) he chiefly failed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPeregrine, not a little piqued to hear the qualifications of such a\ncelebrated actor in England treated with such freedom and disrespect,\nanswered, with some asperity, that the chevalier was a true critic,\nmore industrious in observing the blemishes than in acknowledging the\nexcellence of those who fell under his examination.\n\nIt was not to be supposed that one actor could shine equally in all\ncharacters; and though his observations were undoubtedly very judicious,\nhe himself could not help wondering that some of them had always escaped\nhis notice, though he had been an assiduous frequenter of the\nplayhouse. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe player in question,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009chas, in your own opinion,\nconsiderable share of merit in the characters of comic life; and as to\nthe manners of the great personages in tragedy, and the operation of\nthe grand passions of the soul, I apprehend they may be variously\nrepresented, according to the various complexion and cultivation of\ndifferent men, A Spaniard, for example, though impelled by the same\npassion, will express it very differently from a Frenchman; and what\nis looked upon as graceful vivacity and address by the one, would be\nconsidered as impertinence and foppery by the other; nay, so opposite is\nyour common deportment from that of some other nations, that one of\nour own countrymen, in the relation of his travels, observes, that the\nPersians even of this age, when they see any man perform unnecessary\ngestures, says he is either a fool or Frenchman. The standard of\ndemeanour being thus unsettled, a Turk, a Moor, an Indian, or inhabitant\nof my country whose customs and dress are widely different from ours,\nmay, in his sentiments, possess all the dignity of the human heart,\nand be inspired by the noblest passion that animates the soul, and yet\nexcite the laughter rather than the respect of an European spectator.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I first beheld your famous Parisian stage heroine in one of her\nprincipal parts, her attitudes seemed so violent, and she tossed\nher arms around with such extravagance, that she put me in mind of\na windmill under the agitation of a hard gale; while her voice and\nfeatures exhibited the lively representation of an English scold. The\naction of your favourite male performer was, in my opinion, equally\nunnatural: he appeared with the affected airs of a dancing-master; at\nthe most pathetic junctures of his fate he lifted up his hands above his\nhead, like a tumbler going to vault, and spoke as if his throat had\nbeen obstructed by a hair-brush: yet, when I compared their manners with\nthose of the people before whom they performed, and made allowance\nfor that exaggeration which obtains on all theatres, I was insensibly\nreconciled to their method of performance, and I could distinguish\nabundance of merit beneath that oddity of appearance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe chevalier, perceiving Peregrine a little irritated at what he had\nsaid, asked pardon for the liberty he had taken in censuring the English\nplayers; assuring him that he had an infinite veneration for the British\nlearning, genius, and taste, which were so justly distinguished in\nthe world of letters; and that, notwithstanding the severity of his\ncriticism, he thought the theatre of London much better supplied with\nactors than that of Paris. The young gentleman thanked him for his\npolite condescension, at which Pallet excited, saying, with a shake of\nthe head, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe so, too, Monsieur;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the physician, impatient\nof the dispute in which he had borne no share, observed, with a\nsupercilious air, that the modern stage was altogether beneath one who\nhad an idea of ancient magnificence and execution; that plays ought to\nbe exhibited at the expense of the state, as those of Sophocles were by\nthe Athenians; and that proper judges should be appointed for receiving\nor rejecting all such performances as are offered to the public.\n\nHe then described the theatre at Rome, which contained eighty thousand\nspectators; gave them a learned disquisition into the nature of the\npersona, or mask, worn by the Roman actors, which, he said, was a\nmachine that covered the whole head, furnished on the inside with a\nbrazen concavity, that, by reverberating, the sound, as it issued from\nthe mouth, raised the voice, so as to render it audible to such an\nextended audience. He explained the difference between the saltator and\ndeclamator, one of whom acted, while the other rehearsed the part; and\nfrom thence took occasion to mention the perfection of their pantomimes,\nwho were so amazingly distinct in the exercise of their art, that a\ncertain prince of Pontus, being at the court of Nero, and seeing one of\nthem represent a story, begged him of the emperor, in order to employ\nhim as an interpreter among barbarous nations, whose language he did\nnot understand. Nay, divers cynic philosophers, who had condemned this\nentertainment unseen, when they chanced to be eye-witnesses of their\nadmirable dexterity, expressed their sorrow for having so long debarred\nthemselves of such national enjoyment.\n\nHe dissented, however, from the opinion of Peregrine, who, as a proof of\ntheir excellence, had advanced that some of the English actors fancied\nthemselves the very thing they represented; and recounted a story from\nLucian, of a certain celebrated pantomime, who, in, acting the part of\nAjax in his frenzy, was transported into a real fit of delirium, during\nwhich he tore to pieces the clothes of that actor who stalked before\nhim, beating the stage with iron shoes, in order to increase the noise;\nsnatched an instrument from one of the musicians, and broke it over the\nhead of him who represented Ulysses; and, running to the consular bench,\nmistook a couple of senators for the sheep which were to be slain. The\naudience applauded him to the skies: but so conscious was the mimic of\nhis own extravagance when he recovered the use of his reason, that he\nactually fell sick with mortification; and being afterwards desired to\nre-act the piece, flatly refused to appear in any such character, saying\nthat the shortest follies were the best, and that it was sufficient for\nhim to have been a madman once in his life.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII.\n\n\n\nAn Adventure happens to Pipes, in consequence of which he is dismissed\nfrom Peregrine's Service--The whole Company set out for Ghent, in the\nDiligence--Our Hero is captivated by a Lady in that Carriage--Interests\nher spiritual Director in his behalf.\n\n\nThe doctor being fairly engaged on the subject of the ancients, would\nhave proceeded the Lord knows how far, without hesitation, had not he\nbeen interrupted by the arrival of Mr. Jolter, who, in great confusion,\ntold them that Pipes, having affronted a soldier, was then surrounded\nin the street, and certainly would be put to death if some person of\nauthority did not immediately interpose in his behalf.\n\nPeregrine no sooner learned the danger of his trusty squire, than,\nsnatching up his sword, he ran down-stairs, and was followed by the\nchevalier, entreating him to leave the affair to his management. Within\nten yards of the door they found Tom, with his back to a wall, defending\nhimself with a mopstick against the assault of three or four soldiers,\nwho, at sight of the Maltese cross, desisted from the attack, and were\ntaken into custody by order of the knight. One of the aggressors, being\nan Irishman, begged to be heard with great importunity before he should\nbe sent to the guard; and, by the mediation of Pickle, was accordingly\nbrought into the hotel with his companions, all three bearing upon\ntheir heads and faces evident marks of their adversary's prowess and\ndexterity. The spokesman, being confronted with Pipes, informed the\ncompany that, having by accident met with Mr. Pipes, whom he considered\nas his countryman, though fortune had disposed of them in different\nservices, he invited him to drink a glass of wine, and accordingly\ncarried him to a cabaret, where he introduced him to his comrades;\nbut in the course of the conversation, which turned upon the power and\ngreatness of the kings of France and England, Mr. Pipes had been pleased\nto treat his most Christian Majesty with great disrespect; and when he,\nthe entertainer, expostulated with him in a friendly manner about his\nimpolite behaviour, observing, that he, being in the French service,\nwould be under the necessity of resenting his abuse if he did not put a\nstop to it before the other gentlemen of the cloth should comprehend\nhis meaning; he had set them all three at defiance, dishonoured him in\nparticular with the opprobrious epithet of rebel to his native king and\ncountry, and even drunk, in broken French, to the perdition of Louis and\nall his adherents; that, compelled by this outrageous conduct, he, as\nthe person who had recommended him to their society, had, in vindication\nof his own character, demanded of the delinquent, who, on pretence\nof fetching a sword, had gone to his lodging, from whence he all of a\nsudden sallied upon them with the mopstick, which he employed in the\nannoyance of them all without distinction, so that they were obliged to\ndraw in their own defence.\n\nPipes, being questioned by his master with regard to the truth of this\naccount, owned that every circumstance was justly represented; saying,\nhe did not value their cheese-toasters a pinch of oakum; and that if the\ngentleman had not shot in betwixt them, he would have trimmed them\nto such a tune, that they should not have had a whole yard to square.\nPeregrine reprimanded him sharply for his unmannerly behaviour, and\ninsisted upon his asking pardon of those he had injured upon the spot:\nbut no consideration was efficacious enough to produce such concession;\nto this command he was both deaf and dumb; and the repeated threats\nof his master had no more effect than if they had been addressed to a\nmarble statue. At length, our hero, incensed at his obstinacy, started\nup, and would have chastised him with manual operation, had not he been\nprevented by the chevalier, who found means to moderate his indignation\nso far that he contented himself with dismissing the offender from his\nservice; and after having obtained the discharge of the prisoners, gave\nthem a louis to drink, by way of recompense for the disgrace and damage\nthey had sustained.\n\nThe knight, perceiving our young gentleman very much ruffled at\nthis accident, and reflecting upon the extraordinary deportment and\nappearance of his valet, whose hair had by this time adopted a grizzled\nhue, imagined he was some favourite domestic, who had grown gray in the\nservice of his master's family, and that, of consequence, he was uneasy\nat the sacrifice he had made. Swayed by this conjecture, he earnestly\nsolicited in his behalf; but all he could obtain, was a promise of\nre-admitting him into favour on the terms already proposed, or at least\non condition that he should make his acknowledgment to the chevalier,\nfor his want of reverence and respect for the French monarch.\n\nUpon this condescension the culprit was called up-stairs, and made\nacquainted with the mitigation of his fate; upon which he said, he would\ndown on his marrow-bones to his own master, but would be d--d before he\nwould ask pardon of e'er a Frenchman in Christendom. Pickle, exasperated\nat this blunt declaration, ordered him out of his presence, and charged\nhim never to appear before his face again; while the officer in vain\nemployed all his influence and address to appease his resentment, and\nabout midnight took his leave with marks of mortification at his want of\nsuccess.\n\nNext day the company agreed to travel through Flanders in the diligence,\nby the advice of Peregrine, who was not without hope of meeting with\nsome adventure or amusement in that carriage; and Jolter took care to\nsecure places for them all; it being resolved that the valet-de-chambre\nand the doctor's man should attend the vehicle on horseback; and as for\nthe forlorn Pipes, he was left to reap the fruits of his own\nstubborn disposition, notwithstanding the united efforts of the whole\ntriumvirate, who endeavoured to procure his pardon.\n\nEvery previous measure being thus taken, they set out from Lisle about\nsix in the morning, and found themselves in the company of a female\nadventurer, a very handsome young lady, a Capuchin, and a Rotterdam\nJew. Our young gentleman, being the first of this society that entered,\nsurveyed the stranger with an attentive eye, and seated himself\nimmediately behind the beautiful unknown, who at once attracted his\nattention. Pallet, seeing another lady unengaged, in imitation of his\nfriend, took possession of her neighbourhood; the physician paired with\nthe priest, and Jolter sat down by the Jew.\n\nThe machine had not proceeded many furlongs, when Pickle, accosting the\nfair incognita, congratulated himself upon his happiness, in being the\nfellow-traveller of so charming a lady. She, without the least reserve\nor affectation, thanked him for his compliment; and replied, with a\nsprightly air, that now they were embarked in one common bottom, they\nmust club their endeavours to make one another as happy as the nature\nof their situation would permit them to be. Encouraged by this frank\nintimation, and captivated by her fine black eyes and easy behaviour,\nhe attached himself to her from that moment; and, in a little time, the\nconversation became so particular, that the Capuchin thought proper\nto interfere in the discourse in such a manner as gave the youth to\nunderstand that he was there on purpose to superintend her conduct. He\nwas doubly rejoiced at this discovery, in consequence of which he hoped\nto profit in his addresses, not only by the young lady's restraint,\nthat never fails to operate in behalf of the lover, but also by the\ncorruptibility of her guardian, whom he did not doubt of rendering\npropitious to his cause. Flushed with these expectations, he behaved\nwith uncommon complacency to the father, who was charmed with the\naffability of his carriage, and on the faith of his generosity abated of\nhis vigilance so much, that our hero carried on his suit without further\nmolestation; while the painter, in signs and loud bursts of laughter,\nconversed with his dulcinea, who was perfectly well versed in these\nsimple expressions of satisfaction, and had already found means to make\na dangerous invasion upon his heart.\n\nNor were the governor and physician unemployed, while their friends\ninterested themselves in this agreeable manner. Jolter no sooner\nperceived the Hollander was a Jew, than he entered into an investigation\nof the Hebrew tongue, in which he was a connoisseur; and the doctor at\nthe same time attacked the mendicant on the ridiculous maxims of his\norder, together with the impositions of priestcraft in general, which,\nhe observed, prevailed so much among those who profess the Roman\nCatholic religion.\n\nThus coupled, each committee enjoyed their own conversation apart,\nwithout any danger of encroachment; and all were so intent upon their\nseveral topics, that they scarce allowed themselves a small interval\nin viewing the desolation of Menin, as they passed through that ruined\nfrontier. About twelve o'clock they arrived at Courtray, where the\nhorses are always changed, and the company halt an hour for refreshment.\nHere Peregrine handed his charmer into an apartment, where she was\njoined by the other lady; and on pretence of seeing some of the churches\nin town, put himself under the direction of the Capuchin, from whom he\nlearned that the lady was wife to a French gentleman, to whom she had\nbeen married about a year, and that she was now on her journey to visit\nher mother, who lived in Brussels, and was at that time laboured under a\nlingering distemper, which, in all probability, would soon put a period\nto her life. He then launched out in praise of her daughter's virtue\nand conjugal affection; and, lastly, told him, that he was her\nfather-confessor, and pitched upon to be her conductor through Flanders,\nby her husband, as well as his wife, placed the utmost confidence in his\nprudence and integrity.\n\nPickle easily comprehended the meaning of this insinuation, and took\nthe hint accordingly. He tickled the priest's vanity with extraordinary\nencomiums upon the disinterested principles of his order, which were\ndetached from all worldly pursuits, and altogether devoted to the\neternal salvation of mankind. He applauded their patience, humility, and\nlearning, and lavished a world of praise upon their talent in preaching,\nwhich, he said, had more than once operated so powerfully upon him, that\nhad he not been restrained by certain considerations which he could\nnot possibly waive, he should have embraced their tenets, and begged\nadmission into their fraternity: but, as the circumstances of his fate\nwould not permit him to take such a salutary measure for the present,\nhe entreated the good father to accept a small token of his love and\nrespect, for the benefit of that convent to which he belonged. So\nsaying he pulled out a purse of ten guineas, which the Capuchin\nobserving, turned his head another way, and, lifting up his arm,\ndisplayed a pocket almost as high as his collar-bone, in which he\ndeposited the money.\n\nThis proof of affection for the order produced a sudden and surprising\neffect upon the friar. In the transport of his zeal he wrung this\nsemi-convert's hand, showered a thousand benedictions upon his head, and\nexhorted him, with the tears flowing from his eyes, to perfect the great\nwork which the finger of God had begun in his heart; and, as an instance\nof his concern for the welfare of his precious soul, the holy brother\npromised to recommend him strenuously to the pious admonitions of the\nyoung woman under his care, who was a perfect saint upon earth, and\nendowed with a peculiar gift of mollifying the hearts of obdurate\nsinners. \u00e2\u0080\u009cO father!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the hypocritical projector, who by this time\nperceived that his money was not thrown away, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I could be favoured\nbut for one half hour with the private instruction of that inspired\ndevotee, my mind presages, that I should be a strayed sheep brought\nback into the fold, and that I should find easy entrance at the gates of\nheaven! There is something supernatural in her aspect: I gaze upon her\nwith the most pious fervour, and my whole soul is agitated with tumults\nof hope and despair!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaving pronounced this rhapsody with transport half natural and half\naffected, the priest assured him, that these were the operations of the\nSpirit, which must not be repressed; and comforted him with the hope of\nenjoying the blessed interview which he desired, protesting, that, as\nfar as his influence extended, his wish should be that very evening\nindulged. The gracious pupil thanked him for his benevolent concern,\nwhich he swore should not be squandered upon an ungrateful object; and\nthe rest of the company interrupting the conversation, they returned in\na body to the inn, where they dined all together, and the ladies were\npersuaded to be our hero's guests.\n\nAs the subjects on which they had been engaged before dinner were not\nexhausted, each brace resumed their former theme when they were replaced\nin the diligence. The painter's mistress finished her conquest, by\nexerting her skill in the art of ogling, accompanied by frequent\nbewitching sighs and some tender French songs, that she sang with such\npathetic expression, as quite melted the resolution of Pallet, and\nutterly subdued his affection. And he, to convince her of the importance\nof her victory, gave a specimen of his own talents, by entertaining her\nwith that celebrated English ditty, the burden of which begins with,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe pigs they lie with their a--s bare.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII.\n\n\n\nHe makes some Progress in her Affections--Is interrupted by a Dispute\nbetween Jolter and the Jew--Appeases the Wrath of the Capuchin, who\nprocures for him an interview with his fair Enslaver, in which he finds\nhimself deceived.\n\n\nPeregrine, meanwhile, employed all his insinuation and address in\npractising upon the heart of the Capuchin's fair charge. He had long ago\ndeclared his passion, not in the superficial manner of a French gallant,\nbut with all the ardour of an enthusiast. He had languished, vowed,\nflattered, kissed her hand by stealth, and had no reason to complain\nof his reception. Though, by a man of a less sanguine disposition, her\nparticular complaisance would have been deemed equivocal, and perhaps\nnothing more than the effects of French breeding and constitutional\nvivacity; he gave his own qualifications credit for the whole, and with\nthese sentiments carried on the attack with such unabating vigour, that\nshe was actually prevailed upon to accept a ring, which he presented\nas a token of his esteem; and everything proceeded in a most prosperous\ntrain, when they were disturbed by the governor Israelite, who, in\nthe heat of disputation, raised their voices, and poured forth such\neffusions of gutturals, as set our lover's teeth on edge. As they spoke\nin a language unknown to every one in the carriage but themselves,\nand looked at each other with mutual animosity and rancour, Peregrine\ndesired to know the cause of their contention; upon which Jolter\nexclaimed, in a furious tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis learned Levite, forsooth, has the\nimpudence to tell me that I don't understand Hebrew; and affirms that\nthe word Benoni signifies 'child of joy;' whereas, I can prove, and\nhave already said enough to convince any reasonable man, that in the\nSeptuagint it is rightly translated into 'son of my sorrow.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaving thus explained himself to his pupil, he turned to the priest,\nwith intention to appeal to his determination; but the Jew pulled him by\nthe sleeve with great eagerness, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the love of God, be\nquiet: the Capuchin will discover who we are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Joker, offended at this\nconjunction, echoed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho we are!\u00e2\u0080\u009d with great emphasis; and repeating\nnos poma natamus, asked ironically, to which of the tribes the Jew\nthought he belonged? The Levite, affronted at his comparing him to a\nball of horse-dung, replied, with a most significant grin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo the tribe\nof Issachar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His antagonist, taking the advantage of his unwillingness\nto be known by the friar, and prompted by revenge for the freedom he\nhad used, answered, in the French language, that the judgment of God\nwas still manifest upon their whole race, not only in their being in the\nstate of exiles from their native land, but also in the spite of their\nhearts and pravity of their dispositions, which demonstrate them to be\nthe genuine offspring of those who crucified the Saviour of the world.\n\nHis expectation was, however, defeated: the priest himself was too\ndeeply engaged to attend to the debates of other people. The physician,\nin the pride and insolence of his learning, had undertaken to display\nthe absurdity of the Christian faith; having already, as he thought,\nconfuted the Capuchin, touching the points of belief in which the Roman\nCatholics differ from the rest of the world. But not cemented with the\nimagined victory he had gained, he began to strike at the fundamentals\nof religion; and the father, with incredible forbearance, suffered him\nto make very free with the doctrine of the Trinity: but, when he leveled\nthe shafts of his ridicule at the immaculate conception of the Blessed\nVirgin, the good man's patience forsook him, his eyes seemed to kindle\nwith indignation, he trembled in every joint, and uttered, with a loud\nvoice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are an abominable--I will not call thee heretic, for thou\nart worse, if possible, than a Jew; you deserve to be inclosed in\na furnace seven times heated; and I have a good mind to lodge an\ninformation against you with the governor of Ghent, that you may be\napprehended and punished as an impious blasphemer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis menace operated like a charm upon all present. The doctor was\nconfounded, the governor dismayed, the Levite's teeth chattered, the\npainter astonished at the general confusion, the cause of which he could\nnot comprehend, and Pickle himself, not a little alarmed, was obliged to\nuse all his interest and assiduity in appeasing this son of the church,\nwho, at length, in consideration of the friendship he professed for the\nyoung gentleman, consented to forgive what had passed, but absolutely\nrefused to sit in contact with such a profane wretch, whom he looked\nupon as a fiend of darkness, sent by the enemy of mankind to poison the\nminds of weak people; so that, after having crossed himself and uttered\ncertain exorcisms, he insisted upon the doctor's changing places with\nthe Jew, who approached the offended ecclesiastic in an agony of fear.\n\nMatters being thus compromised, the conversation flowed in a more\ngeneral channel; and without the intervention of any other accident\nor bone of contention, the carriage arrived at the city of Ghent about\nseven in the evening. Supper being bespoken for the whole company, our\nadventurer and his friends went out to take a superficial view of\nthe place, leaving his new mistress to the pious exhortations of her\nconfessor, whom, as we have already observed, he had secured in his\ninterest. This zealous mediator spoke so warmly in his commendation,\nand interested her conscience so much in the affair, that she could\nnot refuse her helping hand to the great work of his conversion, and\npromised to grant the interview he desired.\n\nThis agreeable piece of intelligence, which the Capuchin communicated to\nPeregrine at his return, elevated his spirits to such a degree, that he\nshone at supper with uncommon brilliance, in a thousand sallies of wit\nand pleasantry, to the delight of all present, especially of his fair\nFleming, who seemed quite captivated by his person and behaviour. The\nevening being thus spent to the satisfaction of all parties, the company\nbroke up, and retired to their several apartments, where our lover, to\nhis unspeakable mortification, learned that the two ladies were\nobliged to be in the same room, all the other chambers of the inn being\npre-occupied. When he imparted this difficulty to the priest, that\ncharitable father, who was very fruitful in expedients, assured him\nthat his spiritual concerns should not be obstructed by such a slender\nimpediment; and accordingly availed himself of his prerogative, by going\ninto his daughter's chamber when she was almost undressed, and leading\nher into his own, on pretence of administering salutary food for her\nsoul. Having brought the two votaries together, he prayed for success\nto the operations of grace, and left them to their mutual meditations,\nafter having conjured them in the most solemn manner to let no impure\nsentiments or temptations of the flesh interfere with the hallowed\ndesign of their meeting.\n\nThe reverend intercessor being gone, and the door fastened on the\ninside, the pseudo-convert, transported with his passion, threw himself\nat his Amanda's feet; and begging she would spare him the tedious form\nof addresses, which the nature of their interview would not permit him\nto observe, began, with all the impetuosity of love, to make the most\nof the occasion. But whether she was displeased by the intrepidity and\nassurance of his behaviour, thinking herself entitled to more courtship\nand respect; or was really better fortified with chastity than he or his\nprocurer had supposed her to be; certain it is, she expressed resentment\nand surprise at his boldness and presumption, and upbraided him with\nhaving imposed upon the charity of the friar. The young gentleman was\nreally as much astonished at this rebuff, as she pretended to be at his\ndeclaration, and earnestly entreated her to consider how precious\nthe moments were, and for once sacrifice superfluous ceremony to the\nhappiness of one who adored her with such a flame as could not fail to\nconsume his vitals, if she would not deign to bless him with her favour.\n\nNotwithstanding all his tears, vows, and supplications, his personal\naccomplishments, and the tempting opportunity, all that he could obtain\nwas an acknowledgment of his having made an impression upon her heart,\nwhich she hoped the dictates of her duty would enable her to erase. This\nconfession he considered as a delicate consent; and, obeying the impulse\nof his love, snatched her up in his arms, with an intention of seizing\nthat which she declined to give; when this French Lucretia, unable\nto defend her virtue any other way, screamed aloud; and the Capuchin,\nsetting his shoulder to the door, forced it open, and entered in an\naffected ecstasy of amazement. He lifted up his hands and eyes, and\npretended to be thunderstruck at the discovery he had made; then in\nbroken exclamations, professed his horror at the wicked intention of our\nhero, who had covered such a damnable scheme with the mask of religion.\n\nIn short, he performed his cue with such dexterity, that the lady,\nbelieving him to be in earnest, begged he would forgive the stranger on\naccount of his youth and education, which had been tainted by the errors\nof heresy; and he was on these considerations content to accept the\nsubmission of our hero; who, far from renouncing his expectations,\nnotwithstanding this mortifying repulse, confided so much in his\nown talents, and the confession which his mistress had made, that he\nresolved to make another effort, to which nothing could have prompted\nhim but the utmost turbulence of unruly desire.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV.\n\n\n\nHe makes another Effort to towards the Accomplishment of his Wish, which\nis postponed by a strange Accident.\n\n\nHe directed his valet-de-chambre, who was a thorough-paced pimp,\nto kindle some straw in the yard, and then pass by the door of her\napartment, crying with a loud voice that the house was on fire.\nThis alarm brought both ladies out of their chamber in a moment, and\nPeregrine, taking the advantage of their running to the street door,\nentered the room, concealed himself under a large table that stood in an\nunobserved corner. The nymphs, as soon as they understood the cause\nof his Mercury's supposed affright, returned to their apartment, and,\nhaving said their prayers, undressed themselves, and went to bed.\nThis scene, which fell under the observation of Pickle, did not at all\ncontribute to the cooling of his concupiscence, but on the contrary\ninflamed him to such a degree, that he could scarce restrain his\nimpatience, until, by her breathing deep, he concluded the fellow-lodger\nof his Amanda was asleep. This welcome note no sooner saluted his ears,\nthan he crept to his charmer's bedside, and placing himself on his\nknees, gently laid hold on her white hand, and pressed it to his lips.\nShe had just begun to close her eyes, and enjoy the agreeable oppression\nof slumber, when she was roused by this rape, at which she started,\npronouncing, in a tone of surprise and dismay, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy God! who's that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe lover, with the most insinuating humility, besought her to hear him;\nvowing that his intention, in approaching her thus, was not to violate\nthe laws of decency, or that indelible esteem which she had engraved on\nhis heart; but to manifest his sorrow and contrition for the umbrage he\nhad given, to pour forth the overflowings of his soul, and tell her that\nhe neither could nor would survive her displeasure. These and many\nmore pathetic protestations, accompanied with sighs and tears and other\nexpressions of grief, which our hero had at command, could not fail to\nmelt the tender heart of the Fleming, already prepossessed in favour of\nhis qualifications. She sympathized so much with his affliction, as\nto weep in her turn, when she represented the impossibility of her\nrewarding his passion; and he, seizing the moment, reinforced his\nsolicitations with such irresistible transports, that her resolution\ngave way, she began to breathe quick, expressed her fear of being\noverheard by the other lady, with an ejaculation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cO heavens! I'm\nundone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d suffered him, after a faint struggle, to make a lodgment upon\nthe covered way of her bed. Her honour, however, was secured for the\npresent, by a strange sort of knocking upon the wainscot, at the other\nend of the room, hard by the bed in which the female adventurer lay.\n\nSurprised at this circumstance, the lady begged him for heaven's sake\nto retreat, or her reputation would be ruined for ever; but when he\nrepresented to her, that her character would run a much greater risk\nif he should be detected in withdrawing, she consented, with great\ntrepidation, to his stay, and they listened in silence to the sequel of\nthe noise that alarmed them. This was no other than an expedient of the\npainter to awaken his dulcinea, with whom he had made an assignation,\nor at least interchanged such signals as he thought amounted to a firm\nappointment. His nymph, being disturbed in her first sleep, immediately\nunderstood the sound, and, true to the agreement, rose; and, unbolting\nthe door, as softly as possible, gave him admittance; leaving it open\nfor his more commodious retreat.\n\nWhile this happy gallant was employed in disengaging himself from\nthe deshabille in which he had entered, the Capuchin, suspecting that\nPeregrine would make another attempt upon his charge, had crept silently\nto the apartment in order to reconnoitre, lest the adventure should be\nachieved without his knowledge; a circumstance that would deprive him\nof the profits he might expect from his privity and concurrence. Finding\nthe door unlatched, his suspicion was confirmed, and he made no scruple\nof creeping into the chamber on all four; so that the painter, having\nstripped himself to the shirt, in groping about for his dulcinea's bed,\nchanced to lay his hand upon the shaven crown of the father's head,\nwhich, by a circular motion, the priest began to turn round in his\ngrasp, like a ball in a socket, to the surprise and consternation of\npoor Pallet, who, neither having penetration to comprehend the case,\nnor resolution to withdraw his fingers from this strange object of his\ntouch, stood sweating in the dark, and venting ejaculations with great\ndevotion.\n\nThe friar, tired with this exercise, and the painful posture in which he\nstooped, raised himself gradually upon his feet, heaving up at the same\ntime the hand of the painter, whose terror and amazement increased to\nsuch a degree at this unaccountable elevation, that his faculties began\nto fail; and his palm, in the confusion of his fright, sliding over the\npriest's forehead, one of his fingers happened to slip into his mouth,\nand was immediately secured between the Capuchin's teeth with as firm a\nfixture as if it had been screwed in a blacksmith's vice.\n\nThe painter was so much disordered by this sudden snap, which tortured\nhim to the bone, that, forgetting all other considerations, he roared\naloud, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMurder! a fire! a trap, a trap! help, Christians, for the love\nof God, help!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Our hero, confounded by these exclamation, which he\nknew would soon fill the room with spectators, and incensed at his own\nmortifying disappointment, was obliged to quit the untasted banquet,\nand, approaching the cause of his misfortune, just as his tormentor\nhad thought proper to release his finger, discharged such a hearty\nslap between his shoulders, as brought him to the ground with hideous\nbellowing; then, retiring unperceived to his own chamber, was one of the\nfirst who returned with a light, on pretence of having been alarmed\nwith his cries. The Capuchin had taken the same precaution, and followed\nPeregrine into the room, pronouncing benedicite, and crossing himself\nwith many marks of astonishment. The physician and Jolter appearing\nat the same time, the unfortunate painter was found lying naked on the\nfloor, in all the agony of horror and dismay, blowing upon his left\nhand, that hung dangling from the elbow. The circumstance of his being\nfound in that apartment, and the attitude of his affliction, which was\nextremely ridiculous, provoked the doctor to a smile, and produced a\nsmall relaxation in the severity of the governor's countenance; while\nPickle, testifying his surprise and concern, lifted him from the ground,\nand inquired into the cause of his present situation.\n\nHaving, after some recollection, and fruitless endeavours to speak,\nrecovered the use of his tongue, he told them that the house was\ncertainly haunted by evil spirits, by which he had been conveyed, he\nknew not how, into that apartment, and afflicted with all the tortures\nof hell: that one of them had made itself sensible to his feeling, in\nthe shape of a round ball of smooth flesh, which turned round under his\nhand, like an astronomer's globe; and then, rising up to a surprising\nheight, was converted into a machine that laid hold on his finger, by a\nsnap; and having pinned him to the spot, he continued for some moments\nin unspeakable agony. At last, he said, the engine seemed to melt away\nfrom his finger, and he received a sudden thwack upon his shoulders, as\nif discharged by the arm of a giant, which overthrew him in an instant\nupon the floor.\n\nThe priest, hearing this strange account, pulled out of one of his\npouches a piece of consecrated candle, which he lighted immediately, and\nmuttered certain mysterious conjurations. Jolter, imagining that Pallet\nwas drunk, shook his head, saying, he believed the spirit was nowhere\nbut in his own brain. The physician for once condescended to be a wag,\nand, looking towards one of the beds, observed, that, in his opinion,\nthe painter had been misled by the flesh, and not by the spirit. The\nfair Fleming lay in silent astonishment and affright; and her fellow\nin order to acquit herself of all suspicion, exclaimed with incredible\nvolubility against the author of this uproar, who, she did not doubt,\nhad concealed himself in the apartment with a view of perpetuating some\nwicked attempt upon her precious virtue, and was punished and prevented\nby the immediate interposition of heaven. At her desire, therefore, and\nat the earnest solicitation of the other lady, he was conducted to his\nown bed; and the chamber being evacuated, they locked their door, fully\nresolved to admit no more visitants for that night: while Peregrine,\nmad with seeing the delicious morsel snatched, as it were, from his very\nlip, stalked through the passage like a ghost, in hope of finding some\nopportunity of re-entering; till the day beginning to break, he was\nobliged to retire, cursing the idiotical conduct of the painter, which\nhad so unluckily interfered with his delight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV.\n\n\n\nThey depart from Ghent--Our Hero engages in a Political Dispute with his\nMistress, whom he offends, and pacifies with Submission--He practises\nan Expedient to detain the Carriage at Alost, and confirms the Priest in\nhis Interest.\n\n\nNext day, about one o'clock, after having seen everything remarkable in\ntown, and been present at the execution of two youths, who were hanged\nfor ravishing a w--, they took their departure from Ghent in the same\ncarriage which had brought them thither; and the conversation turning\nupon the punishment they had seen inflicted, the Flemish beauty\nexpressed great sympathy and compassion for the unhappy sufferers,\nwho, as she had been informed, had fallen victims to the malice of the\naccuser. Her sentiments were espoused by all the company, except the\nFrench lady of pleasure, who, thinking the credit of the sisterhood\nconcerned in the affair, bitterly inveighed against the profligacy of\nthe age, and particularly the base and villainous attempts of man upon\nthe chastity of the weaker sex; saying, with a look of indignation\ndirected to the painter, that for her own part she should never be\nable to manifest the acknowledgment she owed to Providence, for having\nprotected her last night from the wicked aims of unbridled lust. This\nobservation introduced a series of jokes at the expense of Pallet, who\nhung his ears, and sat with a silent air of dejection, fearing that,\nthrough the malevolence of the physician, his adventure might reach the\nears of his wife. Indeed, though we have made shift to explain the\nwhole transaction to the reader, it was an inextricable mystery to every\nindividual in the diligence, because the part which was acted by the\nCapuchin was known to himself alone, and even he was utterly ignorant\nof Pickle's being concerned in the affair; so that the greatest share\nof the painter's sufferings were supposed to be the exaggerations of his\nown extravagant imagination.\n\nIn the midst of their discourse on this extraordinary subject, the\ndriver told them that they were now on the very spot where a detachment\nof the allied army had been intercepted and cut off by the French: and,\nstopping the vehicle, entertained them with a local description of the\nbattle of Melle. Upon this occasion, the Flemish lady, who, since her\nmarriage, had become a keen partisan for the French, gave a minute\ndetail of all the circumstances, as they had been represented to her by\nher husband's brother, who was in the action. This account, which sunk\nthe number of the French to sixteen, and raised that of the allies to\ntwenty thousand men, was so disagreeable to truth, as well as to the\nlaudable partiality of Peregrine, that he ventured to contradict her\nassertions, and a fierce dispute commenced, that not only regarded the\npresent question, but also comprehended all the battles in which the\nDuke of Marlborough had commanded against Louis the Fourteenth. In the\ncourse of these debates, she divested the great general of all the\nglory he had acquired, by affirming, that every victory he gained was\npurposely lost by the French in order to bring the schemes of Madame de\nMaintenon into discredit; and, as a particular instance, alledged, that\nwhile the citadel of Lisle was besieged, Louis said, in presence of the\nDauphin, that if the allies should be obliged to raise the siege, he\nwould immediately declare his marriage with that lady; upon which, the\nson sent private orders to Marshal Boufflers to surrender the place.\n\nThis strange allegation was supported by the asseveration of the priest\nand the courtesan, and admitted as truth by the governor, who pretended\nto have heard it from good authority; while the doctor sat neutral, as\none who thought it scandalous to know the history of such modern events.\nThe Israelite, being a true Dutchman, himself under the banners of our\nhero, who, in attempting to demonstrate the absurdity and improbability\nof what they had advanced, raised such a hue and cry against himself,\nand, being insensibly heated in the altercation, irritated his Amanda\nto such a degree, that her charming eyes kindled with fury, and he\nsaw great reason to think, that if he did not fall upon some method to\ndeprecate her wrath, she would, in a twinkling, sacrifice all her esteem\nfor him to her own zeal for the glory of the French nation. Moved by\nthis apprehension, his ardour cooled by degrees, and he insensibly\ndetached himself from the argument, leaving the whole care of supporting\nit to the Jew, who, finding himself deserted, was fain to yield at\ndiscretion; so that the French remained masters of the field, and their\nyoung heroine resumed her good humour.\n\nOur hero having prudently submitted to the superior intelligence of his\nfair enslaver, began to be harassed with the fears of losing her\nfor ever; and set his invention at work, to contrive some means\nof indemnifying himself for his assiduities, presents, and the\ndisappointment he had already undergone. On pretence of enjoying a free\nair, he mounted the box, and employed his elocution and generosity with\nsuch success, that the driver undertook to disable the diligence from\nproceeding beyond the town of Alost for that day; and, in consequence\nof his promise, gently overturned it when they were but a mile short of\nthat baiting-place. He had taken his measures so discreetly, that this\naccident was attended with no other inconvenience than a fit of fear\nthat took possession of the ladies, and the necessity to which they\nwere reduced by the declaration of the coachman, who, upon examining\nthe carriage, assured the company that the axle-tree had given way, and\nadvised them to walk forward to the inn, while he would jog after them\nat a slow pace, and do his endeavour the damage should be immediately\nrepaired.\n\nPeregrine pretended to be very much concerned at what had happened,\nand even cursed the driver for his inadvertency, expressing infinite\nimpatience to be at Brussels, and wishing that this misfortune might\nnot detain them another night upon the road; but when his understrapper,\naccording to his instructions, came afterwards to the inn, and gave them\nto understand that the workman he had employed could not possibly refit\nthe machine in less then six hours, the crafty youth affected to\nlose all temper, stormed at his emissary, whom he reviled in the most\nopprobrious terms, and threatened to cane for his misconduct. The fellow\nprotested, with great humility, that their being overturned was owing to\nthe failure of the axle-tree, and not to his want of care or dexterity\nin driving; though rather than be thought the cause of incommoding\nhim, he would inquire for a post-chaise, in which he might depart for\nBrussels immediately. This expedient Pickle rejected, unless the whole\ncompany could be accommodated in the same manner; and he had been\npreviously informed by the driver that the town could not furnish more\nthan one vehicle of that sort. His governor, who was quite ignorant\nof his scheme, represented that one night would soon be passed, and\nexhorted him to bear this small disappointment with a good grace,\nespecially as the house seemed to be well provided for their\nentertainment, and the company so much disposed to be sociable.\n\nThe Capuchin, who had found his account in cultivating the acquaintance\nof the young stranger, was not ill-pleased at this event, which might,\nby protracting the term of their intercourse, yield him some opportunity\nof profiting still farther by his liberality: he therefore joined Mr.\nJolter in his admonitions, congratulating himself upon the prospect\nof enjoying his conversation a little longer than he had expected.\nOur young gentleman received a compliment to the same purpose from\nthe Hebrew, who had that day exercised his gallantry upon the French\ncoquette, and was not without hope of reaping the fruit of his\nattention, his rival, the painter, being quite disgraced and dejected\nby the adventure of last night, As for the doctor, he was too much\nengrossed in the contemplation of his own importance, to interest\nhimself in the affair or its consequences, further than by observing,\nthat the European powers ought to establish public games, like those\nthat were celebrated of old in Greece; in which case, every state would\nbe supplied with such dexterous charioteers as would drive a machine, at\nfull speed, within a hair's breadth of a precipice, without any danger\nof its being overturned.\n\nPeregrine could not help yielding to their remonstrances and united\ncomplaisance, for which he thanked them in very polite terms; and his\npassion seeming to subside, proposed that they should amuse themselves\nin walking round the ramparts. He hoped to enjoy some private\nconversation with his admired Fleming, who had the whole day behaved\nwith remarkable reserve. The proposal being embraced, he, as usual,\nhanded her into the street, and took all opportunities of promoting his\nsuit; but they were attended so closely by her father-confessor, that\nhe foresaw it would be impracticable to accomplish his aim without the\nconnivance of that ecclesiastic. This he was obliged to purchase with\nanother purse, which he offered, and was accepted, as a charitable\natonement for his criminal behaviour during the interview which the\nfriar had procured for the good of his soul. The benefaction was no\nsooner made, than the mendicant edged off by little and little, till\nhe joined the rest of the company, leaving his generous patron at full\nliberty to prosecute his purpose.\n\nIt is not to be doubted that our adventurer made a good use of this\noccasion: he practised a thousand flowers of rhetoric, and actually\nexhausted his whole address, in persuading her to have compassion upon\nhis misery, and indulge him with another private audience, without which\nhe should run distracted, and be guilty of extravagancies which, in\nthe humanity of her disposition, she would weep to see. But, instead of\ncomplying with his request, she chid him severely for his presumption\nin persecuting her with his vicious addresses: she assured him, that\nalthough she had secured a chamber for herself in this place, because\nshe had no ambition to be better acquainted with the other lady, he\nwould be in the wrong to disturb her with another nocturnal visit, for\nshe was determined to deny him admittance. The lover was comforted by\nthis hint, which he understood in the true acceptation; and his passion\nbeing inflamed by the obstacles he had met with, his heart beat high\nwith the prospect of possession. These raptures of expectation produced\nan inquietude, which disabled him from bearing that share of the\nconversation for which he used to be distinguished. His behaviour\nat supper was a vicissitude of startings and reveries. The Capuchin,\nimputing the disorder to a second repulse from his charge, began to\nbe invaded with the apprehension of being obliged to refund, and in a\nwhisper forbade our hero to despair.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\n\n\nThe French Coquette entraps the Heart of the Jew, against whom Pallet\nenters into a Conspiracy, by which Peregrine is again disappointed, and\nthe Hebrew's Incontinence exposed.\n\n\nMeanwhile the French siren, balked in her design upon her English\ncully, who was so easily disheartened, and hung his ears in manifest\ndespondence, rather than run the risk of making a voyage\nthat should be altogether unprofitable, resolved to practise her charms\nupon the Dutch merchant. She had already made such innovation upon his\nheart, that he cultivated her with peculiar complacency, gazed upon her\nwith a most libidinous stare, and unbended his aspect into a grin\nthat was truly Israelitish. The painter saw and was offended at this\ncorrespondence, which he considered as an insult upon his misfortune,\nas well as an evident preference of his rival; and, conscious of his own\ntimidity, swallowed an extraordinary glass, that his invention might be\nstimulated, and his resolution raised to the contrivance and execution\nof some scheme of revenge. The wine failed in the expected effect, and,\nwithout inspiring him with the plan, served only to quicken his\ndesire of vengeance; so that he communicated his purpose to his friend\nPeregrine, and begged his assistance; but our young gentleman was too\nintent upon his own affair to mind the concerns of any other person; and\nhe declining to be engaged in the project, Pallet had recourse to\nthe genius of Pickle's valet-de-chambre, who readily embarked in the\nundertaking, and invented a plan, which was executed accordingly.\n\nThe evening being pretty far advanced, and the company separated into\ntheir respective apartments, Pickle repaired, in all the impatience of\nyouth and desire, to the chamber of his charmer, and, finding the door\nunbolted, entered in a transport of joy. By the light of the room,\nwhich shone through the window, he was conducted to her bed, which he\napproached in the utmost agitation; and perceiving her to all appearance\nasleep, essayed to wake her with a gentle kiss; but this method proved\nineffectual, because she was determined to save herself the confusion of\nbeing an accomplice in his guilt. He repeated the application, murmured\na most passionate salutation in her ear, and took such other gentle\nmethods of signifying his presence, as persuaded him that she was\nresolved to sleep, in spite of all his endeavours. Flushed with this\nsupposition, he locked the door, in order to prevent interruption; and,\nstealing himself under the clothes, set fortune at defiance, while he\nheld the fair creature circled in his arms.\n\nNevertheless, near as he seemed to be to the happy accomplishment of his\ndesire, his hope was again frustrated with a fearful noise, which in a\nmoment awaked his Amanda in a fright, and for the present engaged all\nhis attention. His valet-de-chambre, whom Pallet had consulted as a\nconfederate in his revenge against the lady of pleasure and her gallant,\nhad hired of certain Bohemians, who chanced to lodge at the inn, a\njackass adorned with bells, which, when everybody was retired to\nrest, and the Hebrew supposed to be bedded with his mistress, they led\nupstairs into a long thoroughfare, from which the chambers were detached\non each side. The painter, perceiving the lady's door ajar, according\nto his expectation, mounted this animal, with intention to ride into the\nroom, and disturb the lovers in the midst of their mutual endearments;\nbut the ass, true to its kind, finding himself bestrid by an unknown\nrider, instead of advancing in obedience to his conductor, retreated\nbackward to the other end of the passage, in spite of all the efforts of\nthe painter, who spurred, and kicked, and pummeled to no purpose. It was\nthe noise of this contention between Pallet and the ass which invaded\nthe ears of Peregrine and his mistress, neither of whom could form the\nleast rational conjecture about the cause of such strange disturbance,\nwhich increased as the animal approached their apartment. At length\nthe bourrique's retrograde motion was obstructed by the door, which\nit forced open in a twinkling, with one kick, and entered with such\ncomplication of sound as terrified the lady almost into a fit, and threw\nher lover into the utmost perplexity and confusion.\n\nThe painter, finding himself thus violently intruded into the\nbed-chamber of he knew not whom, and dreading the resentment of the\npossessor, who might discharge a pistol at him as a robber who had\nbroken into his apartment, was overwhelmed with consternation, and\nredoubled his exertion to accomplish a speedy retreat, sweating all the\ntime with fear, and putting up petition to Heaven for his safety;\nbut his obstinate companion, regardless of his situation, instead of\nsubmitting to his conduct, began to turn round like a millstone, the\nunited sound of his feet and bells producing a most surprising concert.\nThe unfortunate rider, whirling about in this manner, would have quitted\nhis seat, and left the beast to his own amusement, but the rotation was\nso rapid, that the terror of a severe fall hindered him from attempting\nto dismount; and, in the desperation of his heart, he seized one of his\nears, which he pinched so unmercifully, that the creature set up his\nthroat, and brayed aloud.\n\nThis hideous exclamation was no sooner heard by the fair Fleming,\nalready chilled with panic, and prepared with superstition, than,\nbelieving herself visited by the devil, who was permitted to punish her\nfor her infidelity to the marriage-bed, she uttered a scream, and began\nto repeat her pater noster with a loud voice. Her lover, finding himself\nunder the necessity of retiring, started up, and, stung with the most\nviolent pangs of rage and disappointment, ran directly to the spot from\nwhence this diabolical noise seemed to proceed. There encountering the\nass he discharged such a volley of blows at him and his rider, that the\ncreature carried him off at a round trot, and they roared in unison all\nthe way. Having thus cleared the room of such disagreeable company,\nhe went back to his mistress, and assuring her that this was only some\nfoolish prank of Pallet, took his leave, with a promise of returning\nafter the quiet of the inn should be re-established.\n\nIn the mean time, the noise of the bourrique, the cries of the painter,\nand the lady's scream, had alarmed the whole house; and the ass, in the\nprecipitation of his retreat, seeing people with lights before him, took\nshelter in the apartment for which he was at first designed, just as\nthe Levite, aroused at the uproar, had quitted his dulcinea, and was\nattempting to recover his own chamber unperceived. Seeing himself\nopposed by such an animal, mounted by a tall, meagre, lantern-jawed\nfigure, half naked, with a white nightcap upon his head which added to\nthe natural paleness of his complexion,--the Jew was sorely troubled in\nmind and believing it to be an apparition of Balaam and his ass, flew\nbackward with a nimble pace, and crept under the bed, where he lay,\nconcealed. Mr. Jolter and the priest, who were the foremost of those\nwho had been aroused by the noise, were not unmoved when they saw such a\nspectacle rushing into the chamber, whence the lady of pleasure began\nto shriek. The governor made a full halt, and the Capuchin discovered no\ninclination to proceed. They were, however, by the pressure of the crowd\nthat followed them, thrust forward to the door, through which the\nvision entered; and there Jolter, with great ceremony, complimented his\nreverence with the pas, beseeching him to walk in. The mendicant was\ntoo courteous and humble to accept this pre-eminence, and a very earnest\ndispute ensued; during which, the ass, in the course of his circuit,\nshowed himself and rider, and in a trice decided the contest; for,\nstruck with this second glimpse, both at one instant sprang backward\nwith such force, as overturned their next men, who communicated the\nimpulse to those that stood behind them, and these again to others; so\nthat the whole passage was strewed with a long file of people, that lay\nin a line, like the sequel and dependence of a pack of cards.\n\nIn the midst of this havoc, our hero returned from his own room with\nan air of astonishment, asking the cause of this uproar. Receiving such\nhints of intelligence as Jolter's consternation would permit him to\ngive, he snatched the candle out of his hand, and advanced into the\nhaunted chamber without hesitation, being followed by all present, who\nbroke forth into a long and loud peal of laughter, when they perceived\nthe ludicrous source of their disquiet. The painter himself made an\neffort to join their mirth; but he had been so harrowed by fear, and\nsmarted so much with the pain of the discipline he had received from\nPickle, that he could not, with all his endeavours, vanquish the\nruefulness of his countenance. His attempt served only to increase\nthe awkwardness of his situation, which was not at all mended by the\nbehaviour of the coquette, who, furious with her disappointment, slipped\non a petticoat and bedgown, and springing upon him, like mother Hecuba,\nwith her nails deprived all one side of his nose of the skin; and would\nnot have left him an eye to see through, if some of the company had not\nrescued him from her unmerciful talons. Provoked at this outrage, as\nwell as by her behaviour to him in the diligence, he publicly explained\nhis intention in entering her chamber in this equipage; and missing the\nHebrew among the spectators, assured them that he must have absconded\nsomewhere in the apartment. In pursuance of this intimation, the room\nwas immediately searched, and the mortified Levite pulled up by the\nheels from his lurking-place; so that Pallet had the good fortune, at\nlast, to transfer the laugh from himself to his rival and the French\ninamorata, who accordingly underwent the ridicule of the whole audience.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII.\n\n\n\nPallet endeavouring to unravel the Mystery of the Treatment he had\nreceived, falls out of the Frying-pan into the Fire.\n\n\nNevertheless, Pallet was still confounded and chagrined by one\nconsideration, which was no other than that of his having been so\nroughly handled in the chamber, belonging, as he found upon inquiry,\nto the handsome young lady who was under the Capuchin's direction. He\nrecollected that the door was fast locked when his beast burst it open,\nand he had no reason to believe that any person followed him in his\ninruption: on the other hand, he could not imagine that such a gentle\ncreature would either attempt to commit, or be able to execute, such\na desperate assault as that which his body had sustained; and her\ndemeanour was so modest and circumspect, that he durst not harbour the\nleast suspicion of her virtue. These reflections bewildered him in the\nlabyrinth of thought: he rummaged his whole imagination, endeavouring\nto account for what had happened. At length, he concluded, that either\nPeregrine, or the devil, or both must have been at the bottom of the\nwhole affair, and determined, for the satisfaction of his curiosity,\nto watch our hero's motions, during the remaining part of the night, so\nnarrowly, that his conduct, mysterious as it was, should not be able to\nelude his penetration.\n\nWith these sentiments he retired to his own room, after the ass had been\nrestored to the right owners, and the priest had visited and comforted\nhis fair ward, who had been almost distracted with fear. Silence no\nsooner prevailed again, than he crawled darkling towards her door, and\nhuddled himself up in an obscure corner, from whence he might observe\nthe ingress or egress of any human creature. He had not long remained\nin this posture, when, fatigued with this adventure and that of the\npreceding night, his faculties were gradually overpowered with slumber;\nand, falling fast asleep, he began to snore like a whole congregation of\nPresbyterians. The Flemish beauty, hearing this discordant noise in the\npassage, began to be afraid of some new alarm, and very prudently bolted\nher door; so that when her lover wanted to repeat his visit he was not\nonly surprised and incensed at this disagreeable serenade, the author of\nwhich he did not know; but when compelled by his passion, which was\nby this time wound to the highest pitch, he ventured to approach the\nentrance, he had the extreme mortification to find himself shut out. He\ndurst not knock or signify his presence in any other manner, on account\nof the lady's reputation, which would have greatly suffered had the\nsnorer been waked by his endeavours. Had he known that the person\nwho thus thwarted his views was the painter, he would have taken some\neffectual step to remove him; but he could not conceive what should\ninduce Pallet to take up his residence in that corner; nor could he use\nthe assistance of a light, to distinguish him, because there was not a\ncandle burning in the house.\n\nIt is impossible to describe the rage and vexation of our hero, while he\ncontinued thus tantalized upon the brink of bliss, after his desire had\nbeen exasperated by the circumstances of his former disappointments. He\nejaculated a thousand execrations against his own fortune, cursed all\nhis fellow-travellers without exception, vowed revenge against the\npainter, who had twice confounded his most interesting scheme, and was\ntempted to execute immediate vengeance upon the unknown cause of his\npresent miscarriage. In this agony of distraction did he sweat two\nwhole hours in the passage, though not without some faint hope of being\ndelivered from his tormentor, who, he imagined, upon waking, would\nundoubtedly shift his quarters, and leave the field free to his designs;\nbut when he heard the cock repeat his salutation to the morn, which\nbegan to open on the rear of night, he could no longer restrain his\nindignation. Going to his own chamber, he filled a basin with cold\nwater, and, standing at some distance, discharged it full in the face\nof the gaping snorer, who, over and above the surprise occasioned by the\napplication, was almost suffocated by the liquor that entered his\nmouth, and ran down into his windpipe. While he gasped like a person\nhalf-drowned, without knowing the nature of his disaster, or remembering\nthe situation in which he fell asleep, Peregrine retired to his own\ndoor, and, to his no small astonishment, from a long howl that invaded\nhis ears, learned that the patient was no other than Pallet, who had\nnow, for the third time, balked his good fortune.\n\nEnraged at the complicated trespasses of this unfortunate offender,\nhe rushed from his apartment with a horsewhip, and, encountering the\npainter in his flight, overturned him in the passage. There he exercised\nthe instrument of his wrath with great severity on pretence of mistaking\nhim for some presumptuous cur, which had disturbed the repose of the\ninn: nay, when he called aloud for mercy in a supplicating tone, and his\nchastiser could no longer pretend to treat him as a quadruped, such was\nthe virulence of the young gentleman's indignation, that he could\nnot help declaring his satisfaction, by telling Pallet he had richly\ndeserved the punishment he had undergone, for his madness, folly, and\nimpertinence, in contriving and executing such idle schemes, as had no\nother tendency than that of plaguing his neighbours.\n\nPallet protested, with great vehemence, that he was innocent as the\nchild unborn of an intention to give umbrage to any person whatever,\nexcept the Israelite and his doxy, who he knew had incurred his\ndispleasure. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut as God is my Saviour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe I am\npersecuted with witchcraft, and begin to think that d--d priest is\nan agent of the devil; for he has been but two nights in our company,\nduring which I have not closed an eye; but, on the contrary, have been\ntormented by all the fiends of hell.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pickle peevishly replied, that his\ntorments had been occasioned by his own foolish imagination; and asked\nhow he came to howl in that corner. The painter, who did not think\nproper to own the truth, said, that he had been transported thither by\nsome preternatural conveyance, and soused in water by an invisible hand.\nThe youth, in hope of profiting by his absence, advised him to retire\nimmediately to his bed, and by sleep strive to comfort his brain, which\nseemed to be not a little disordered by the want of that refreshment.\nPallet himself began to be very much of the same way of thinking; and,\nin compliance with such wholesome counsel, betook himself to rest,\nmuttering prayers all the way for the recovery of his own understanding.\n\nPickle attended him to his chamber, and, locking him up, put the key in\nhis own pocket, that he might not have it in his power to interrupt him\nagain; but in his return he was met by Mr. Jolter and the doctor, who\nhad been a second time alarmed by the painter's cries, and came to\ninquire about this new adventure. Half-frantic with such a series of\ndisappointments, he cursed them in his heart for their unseasonable\nappearance. When they questioned him about Pallet, he told them he had\nfound him stark staring mad, howling in a corner, and wet to the skin,\nand conducted him to his room, where he was now abed. The physician,\nhearing this circumstance, made a merit of his vanity; and, under\npretence of concern for the patient's welfare, desired he might have an\nopportunity of examining the symptoms of his disorder, without loss of\ntime; alleging that many diseases might have been stifled in the birth,\nwhich afterwards baffled all the endeavours of the medical art. The\nyoung gentleman accordingly delivered the key, and once more withdrew\ninto his own chamber, with a view of seizing the first occasion that\nshould present itself of renewing his application to his Amanda's\ndoor; while the doctor, in his way to Pellet's apartment, hinted to the\ngovernor his suspicion that the patient laboured under that dreadful\nsymptom called the hydrophobia, which he observed had sometimes appeared\nin persons who were not previously bit by a mad dog. This conjecture\nhe founded upon the howl he uttered when he was soused with water, and\nbegan to recollect certain circumstances of the painter's behaviour for\nsome days past, which now he could plainly perceive had prognosticated\nsome such calamity. He then ascribed the distemper to the violent\nfrights he had lately undergone, affirming that the affair of the\nBastille had made such a violent encroachment upon his understanding,\nthat his manner of thinking and speaking was entirely altered. By a\ntheory of his own invention, he explained the effects of fear upon a\nloose system of nerves, and demonstrated the modus in which the animal\nspirits operate upon the ideas and power of imagination.\n\nThis disquisition, which was communicated at the painter's door, might\nhave lasted till breakfast, had not Jolter reminded him of his own\nmaxim, Venienti occurrite morbo; upon which he put the key to immediate\nuse, and they walked softly towards the bed, where the patient lay\nextended at full length in the arms of sleep. The physician took\nnotice of his breathing hard, and his mouth being open; and from\nthese diagnostics declared, that the liquidum nervosum was intimately\naffected, and the saliva impregnated with the spiculated particles\nof the virus, howsoever contracted. This sentence was still farther\nconfirmed by the state of his pulse, which, being full and slow,\nindicated an oppressed circulation, from a loss of elasticity in the\npropelling arteries. He proposed that he should immediately suffer a\nsecond aspersion of water, which would not only contribute to the cure,\nbut also certify them, beyond all possibility of doubt, with regard to\nthe state of the disease; for it would evidently appear, from the manner\nin which he would bear the application, whether or not his horror of\nwater amounted to a confirmed hydrophobia. Mr. Jolter, in compliance\nwith his proposal, began to empty a bottle of water, which he found\nin the room in a basin; when he was interrupted by the prescriber,\nwho advised him to use the contents of the chamberpot, which, being\nimpregnated with salt, would operate more effectually than pure element.\nThus directed, the governor lifted up the vessel, which was replete with\nmedicine, and with one turn of his hand, discharged the whole healing\ninundation upon the ill-omened patient, who, waking in the utmost\ndistraction of horror, yelled most hideously, just at the time when\nPeregrine had brought his mistress to a parley, and entertained hopes of\nbeing admitted into her chamber.\n\nTerrified at this exclamation, she instantly broke off the treaty,\nbeseeching him to retire from the door, that her honour might receive\nno injury from his being found in that place; and he had just enough\nof recollection left to see the necessity of obeying the order; in\nconformity to which he retreated well nigh deprived of his senses, and\nalmost persuaded that so many unaccountable disappointments must have\nproceeded from some supernatural cause, of which the idiot Pallet was no\nmore than the involuntary instrument.\n\nMeanwhile, the doctor having ascertained the malady of the patient,\nwhose cries, interrupted by frequent sobs and sighs, he interpreted into\nthe barking of a dog, and having no more salt-water at hand, resolved to\nrenew the bath with such materials as chance would afford. He actually\nlaid hold of the bottle and basin; but by this time the painter had\nrecovered the use of his senses so well as to perceive his drift,\nand, starting up like a frantic bedlamite, ran directly to his sword,\nswearing, with many horrid imprecations, that he would murder them both\nimmediately, if he should be hanged before dinner, They did not choose\nto wait the issue of his threat, but retired with such precipitation\nthat the physician had almost dislocated his shoulder by running against\none side of the entry. Jolter, having pulled the door after him and\nturned the key, betook himself to flight, roaring aloud for assistance.\nHis colleague, seeing the door secured, valued himself upon his\nresolution, and exhorted him to return; declaring that, for his own\npart, he was more afraid of the madman's teeth than of his weapon, and\nadmonishing the governor to re-enter and execute what they had left\nundone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwithout fear or apprehension; and if any\naccident shall happen to you, either from his slaver or his sword,\nI will assist you with my advice, which from this station I can more\ncoolly and distinctly administer, than I should be able to supply if my\nideas were disturbed, or my attention engaged in any personal concern.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Jolter, who could make no objection to the justness of the conclusion,\nfrankly owned that he had no inclination to try the experiment;\nobserving, that self-preservation was the first law of nature; that his\nconnections with the unhappy lunatic were but slight; and that it could\nnot be reasonably expected that he would run such risks for his service\nas were declined by one who had set out with him from England on the\nfooting of a companion. This insinuation introduced a dispute upon\nthe nature of benevolence, and the moral sense, which, the republican\nargued, existed independent of any private consideration, and could\nnever be affected by any contingent circumstance of time and fortune;\nwhile the other, who abhorred his principles, asserted the duties and\nexcellence of private friendship with infinite rancour of altercation.\n\nDuring the hottest of the argument, they were joined by the Capuchin,\nwho being astonished to see them thus virulently engaged at the door,\nand to hear the painter bellowing within the chamber, conjured them, in\nthe name of God, to tell him the cause of that confusion which had kept\nthe whole house in continual alarm during the best part of the night,\nand seemed to be the immediate work of the devil and his angels. When\nthe governor gave him to understand that Pallet was visited with an evil\nspirit, he muttered a prayer of St. Antonio de Padua, and undertook\nto cure the painter, provided he could be secured so as that he might,\nwithout danger to himself, burn part of a certain relic under his nose,\nwhich he assured them was equal to the miraculous power of Eleazar's\nring. They expressed great curiosity to know what this treasure was; and\nthe priest was prevailed upon to tell them in confidence, that it was\na collection of the parings of the nails belonging to those two madmen,\nwhom Jesus purged of the legion of devils that afterwards entered\nthe swine. So saying, he pulled from one of his pockets a small box,\ncontaining about an ounce of the parings of a horse's hoof; at sight of\nwhich the governor could not help smiling, on account of the grossness\nof the imposition. The doctor asked, with a supercilious smile, whether\nthose maniacs whom Jesus cured were of the sorrel complexion, or\ndapple-gray; for, from the texture of these parings, he could prove that\nthe original owners were of the quadruped order, and even distinguish\nthat their feet had been fortified with shoes of iron.\n\nThe mendicant, who bore an inveterate grudge against this son of\nEsculapius ever since he had made so free with the Catholic religion,\nreplied, with great bitterness, that he was a wretch with whom no\nChristian ought to communicate; that the vengeance of Heaven would one\nday overtake him, on account of his profanity; and that his heart was\nshod with a metal much harder than iron, which nothing but hell fire\nwould be able to melt.\n\nIt was now broad day, and all the servants of the inn were afoot.\nPeregrine, seeing it would be impossible to obtain any sort of\nindemnification for the time he had lost, and the perturbation of\nhis spirits hindering him from enjoying repose, which was moreover\nobstructed by the noise of Pallet and his attendants, put on his clothes\nat once, and, in exceeding ill-humour, arrived at the spot where this\ntriumvirate stood debating about the means of overpowering the furious\npainter, who still continued his song of oaths and execrations, and made\nsundry efforts to break open the door. Chagrined as our hero was, he\ncould not help laughing when he heard how the patient had been treated;\nand his indignation changing into compassion, he called to him through\nthe keyhole, desiring to know the reason of his distracted behaviour.\nPallet no sooner recognized his voice than, lowering his own to a\nwhimpering tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear friend!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have at last detected the\nruffians who have persecuted me so much. I caught them in the fact of\nsuffocating me with cold water; and by the Lord, I will be revenged, or\nmay I never live to finish my Cleopatra. For the love of God! open the\ndoor, and I will make that conceited pagan, that pretender to\ntaste, that false devotee of the ancients, who poisons people with\nsillykicabies and devil's dung--I say, I will make him a monument of my\nwrath, and an example to all the cheats and impostors of the faculty;\nand as for that thick-headed insolent pedant, his confederate, who\nemptied my own jordan upon me while I slept, he had better have been in\nhis beloved Paris, botching schemes for his friend the Pretender, than\nincur the effects of my resentment. Gadsbodikins! I won't leave him a\nwindpipe for the hangman to stop, at the end of another rebellion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPickle told him his conduct had been so extravagant as to confirm the\nwhole company in the belief that he was actually deprived of his senses:\non which supposition, Mr. Jolter and the doctor had acted the part\nof friends, in doing that which they thought most conducive to his\nrecovery: so that their concern merited his thankful acknowledgment,\ninstead of his frantic menaces: that, for his own part, he would be the\nfirst to condemn him, as one utterly bereft of his wits, and give orders\nfor his being secured as a madman, unless he would immediately give a\nproof of his sanity by laying aside his sword, composing his spirits,\nand thanking his injured friends for their care of his person.\n\nThis alternative quieted his transports in a moment: he was terrified at\nthe apprehension of being treated like a bedlamite, being dubious of\nthe state of his own brain; and, on the other hand, had conceived such\na horror and antipathy for his tormentors, that, far from believing\nhimself obliged by what they had done, he could not even think of them\nwithout the utmost rage and detestation. He, therefore, in the most\ntranquil voice he could assume, protested that he never was less out\nof his senses than at present, though he did not know how long he might\nretain them, if he should be considered in the light of a lunatic: that,\nin order to prove his being Compos mentis, he was willing to sacrifice\nthe resentment he so justly harboured against those who, by their\nmalice, had brought him to this pass; but, as he apprehended it would\nbe the greatest sign of madness he could exhibit to thank them for\nthe mischiefs they had brought upon him, he desired to be excused from\nmaking any such concession; and swore he would endure everything rather\nthan be guilty of such mean absurdity.\n\nPeregrine held a consultation upon this reply, when the governor and\nphysician strenuously argued against any capitulation with a maniac, and\nproposed that some method might be taken to seize, fetter, and convey\nhim into a dark room, where he might be treated according to the rules\nof art; but the Capuchin, understanding the circumstances of the case,\nundertook to restore him to his former state, without having recourse to\nsuch violent measures. Pickle, who was a better judge of the affair\nthan any person present, opened the door without further hesitation, and\ndisplayed the poor painter standing with a woeful countenance, shivering\nin his shirt, which was as wet as if he had been dragged through the\nDender:--a spectacle which gave such offence to the chaste eyes of the\nHebrew's mistress, who was by this time one of the spectators, that she\nturned her head another way, and withdrew to her own room, exclaiming\nagainst the indecent practices of men.\n\nPallet, seeing the young gentleman enter, ran to him, and, taking him by\nthe hands, called him his best friend, and said he had rescued him from\nthose who had a design against his life. The priest would have produced\nhis parings and applied them to his nose, but was hindered by Pickle,\nwho advised the patient to shift himself, and put on his clothes. This\nbeing done with great order and deliberation, Mr. Jolter who, with the\ndoctor, had kept a wary distance, in expectation of seeing some storage\neffects of his distraction, began to believe that he had been guilty of\na mistake, and accused the physician of having misled him by his false\ndiagnostic. The doctor still insisted upon his former declaration\nassuring him, that although Pallet enjoyed a short interval for the\npresent, the delirium would soon recur, unless they would profit by this\nmomentary calm, and order him to be blooded, blistered, and purged with\nall imaginable despatch.\n\nThe governor, however, notwithstanding this caution, advanced to the\ninjured party, and begged pardon for the share he had in giving him\nsuch disturbance. He declared, in the most solemn manner, that he had no\nother intention than that of contributing towards his welfare; and that\nhis behaviour was the result of the physician's prescription, which he\naffirmed was absolutely necessary for the recovery of his health.\n\nThe painter, who had very little gall in his disposition, was satisfied\nwith this apology; but his resentment, which was before divided, now\nglowed with double fire against his first fellow-traveller, whom he\nlooked upon as the author of all the mischances he had undergone,\nand marked out for his vengeance accordingly. Yet the doors of\nreconciliation were not shut against the doctor, who, with great\njustice, might have transferred this load of offence from himself\nto Peregrine, who was, without doubt, the source of the painter's\nmisfortune: but, in that case, he must have owned himself mistaken in\nhis medical capacity, and he did not think the friendship of Pallet\nimportant enough to be retrieved by such condescension; so that he\nresolved to neglect him entirely, and gradually forget the former\ncorrespondence he had maintained with a person whom he deemed so\nunworthy of his notice.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII.\n\n\n\nPeregrine, almost distracted with his Disappointment, conjures the\nfair Fleming to permit his Visits at Brussels--She withdraws from his\nPursuit.\n\n\nThings being thus adjusted, and all the company dressed, they went to\nbreakfast about five in the morning; and in less than an hour after were\nseated in the diligence, where a profound silence prevailed. Peregrine,\nwho used to be the life of the society, was extremely pensive and\nmelancholy on account of his mishap, the Israelite and his dulcinea\ndejected in consequence of their disgrace, the poet absorbed in lofty\nmeditation, the painter in schemes of revenge; while Jolter, rocked by\nthe motion of the carriage, made himself amends for the want of rest he\nhad sustained; and the mendicant, with his fair charge, were infected\nby the cloudy aspect of our youth, in whose disappointment each of\nthem, for different reasons, bore no inconsiderable share. This general\nlanguor and recess from all bodily exercise disposed them all to receive\nthe gentle yoke of slumber; and in half-an-hour after they had embarked,\nthere was not one of them awake, except our hero and his mistress,\nunless the Capuchin was pleased to counterfeit sleep, in order to\nindulge our young gentleman with an opportunity of enjoying some private\nconversation with his beauteous ward.\n\nPeregrine did not neglect the occasion; but, on the contrary, seized\nthe first minute, and, in gentle murmurs, lamented his hard hap in\nbeing thus the sport of fortune. He assured her, and that with great\nsincerity, that all the cross accidents of his life had not cost him one\nhalf of the vexation and keenness of chagrin which he had suffered last\nnight; and that now he was on the brink of parting from her, he should\nbe overwhelmed with the blackest despair, if she would not extend her\ncompassion so far as to give him an opportunity of sighing at her feet\nin Brussels, during the few days his affairs would permit him to spend\nin that city. This young lady, with an air of mortification, expressed\nher sorrow for being the innocent cause of his anxiety; said she hoped\nlast night's adventure would be a salutary warning to both their souls;\nfor she was persuaded, that her virtue was protected by the intervention\nof Heaven; that whatever impression it might have made upon him, she was\nenabled by it to adhere to that duty from which her passion had begun to\nswerve; and, beseeching him to forget her for his own peace, gave him to\nunderstand, that neither the plan she had laid down for her own conduct,\nnor the dictates of her honour, would allow her to receive his visits,\nor carry on any other correspondence with him, while she was restricted\nby the articles of her marriage-vow.\n\nThis explanation produced such a violent effect upon her admirer, that\nhe was for some minutes deprived of the faculty of speech; which he no\nsooner recovered, than he gave vent to the most unbridled transports of\npassion. He taxed her with barbarity and indifference; told her, that\nshe had robbed him of his reason and internal peace; that he would\nfollow her to the ends of the earth, and cease to live sooner than cease\nto love her; that he would sacrifice the innocent fool who had been the\noccasion of all this disquiet, and murder every man whom he considered\nas an obstruction to his views. In a word, his passions, which had\ncontinued so long in a state of the highest fermentation, together with\nthe want of that repose which calms and quiets the perturbation of the\nspirits, had wrought him up to a pitch of real distraction. While he\nuttered these delirious expressions, the tears ran down his cheeks; and\nhe underwent such agitation that the tender heart of the fair Fleming\nwas affected with his condition: and, while her own face was bedewed\nwith the streams of sympathy, she begged him, for Heaven's sake, to be\ncomposed; and promised, for his satisfaction, to abate somewhat of the\nrigour of her purpose. Consoled by this kind declaration, he recollected\nhimself; and, taking out his pencil, gave her his address, when she had\nassured him, that he should hear from her in four-and-twenty hours, at\nfarthest, after their separation.\n\nThus soothed, he regained the empire of himself, and, by degrees,\nrecovered his serenity. But this was not the case with his Amanda, who,\nfrom this sample of his disposition, dreaded the impetuosity of his\nyouth, and was effectually deterred from entering into any engagements\nthat might subject her peace and reputation to the rash effects of\nsuch a violent spirit. Though she was captivated by his person and\naccomplishments, she had reflection enough to foresee, that the longer\nshe countenanced his passion, her own heart would be more and more\nirretrievably engaged, and the quiet of her life the more exposed to\ncontinual interruption. She therefore profited by these considerations,\nand a sense of religious honour, which helped her to withstand the\nsuggestions of inclination; and resolved to amuse her lover with\nfalse hopes, until she should have it in her power to relinquish his\nconversation, without running any risk of suffering by the inconsiderate\nsallies of his love. It was with this view that she desired he would not\ninsist upon attending her to her mother's house, when they arrived at\nBrussels; and he, cajoled by her artifice, took a formal leave of her,\ntogether with the other strangers, fixing his habitation at the inn to\nwhich he and his fellow-travellers had been directed, in the impatient\nexpectation of receiving a kind summons from her within the limited\ntime.\n\nMeanwhile, in order to divert his imagination, he went to see\nthe stadthouse, park, and arsenal, took a superficial view of the\nbooksellers' cabinet of curiosities, and spent the evening at the\nItalian opera, which was at that time exhibited for the entertainment\nof Prince Charles of Lorraine, then governor of the Low Countries. In\nshort, the stated period was almost lapsed when Peregrine received a\nletter to this purport:--\n\n     \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,--If you knew what violence I do my own heart, in\n     declaring, that I have withdrawn myself for ever from your\n     addresses, you would surely applaud the sacrifice I make to\n     virtue, and strive to imitate this example of self-denial.\n     Yes, sir, Heaven hath lent me grace to struggle with my guilty\n     passion, and henceforth to avoid the dangerous sight of him,\n     who inspired it. I therefore conjure you, by the regard you\n     ought to have to the eternal welfare of us both, as well as by\n     the esteem and affection you profess, to war with your unruly\n     inclination, and desist from all attempts of frustrating the\n     laudable resolution I have made. Seek not to invade the peace\n     of one who loves you, to disturb the quiet of a family that\n     never did you wrong, and to alienate the thoughts of a weak\n     woman from a deserving man, who, by the most sacred claim,\n     ought to have the full possession of her heart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\nThis billet, without either date or subscription, banished all remains\nof discretion from the mind of our hero, who ran instantly to the\nlandlord in all the ecstasy of madness, and demanded to see the\nmessenger who brought the letter on pain of putting his whole family to\nthe sword. The innkeeper, terrified by his looks and menaces, fell upon\nhis knees, protesting in the face of Heaven that he was utterly ignorant\nand innocent of anything that could give him offence, and that the\nbillet was brought by a person whom he did not know, and who retired\nimmediately, saying it required no answer. He then gave utterance to his\nfury in a thousand imprecations and invectives against the writer,\nwhom he dishonoured with the appellations of a coquette, a jilt, an\nadventurer, who, by means of a pimping priest, had defrauded him of his\nmoney. He denounced vengeance against the mendicant, whom he swore he\nwould destroy if ever he should set eyes on him again.\n\nThe painter unluckily appearing during this paroxysm of rage, he seized\nhim by the throat, saying he was ruined by his accursed folly; and in\nall likelihood poor Pallet would have been strangled had not Jolter\ninterposed in his behalf, beseeching his pupil to have mercy upon the\nsufferer, and, with infinite anxiety, desiring to know the cause of\nthis violent assault. He received no answer but a string of incoherent\ncurses. When the painter, with unspeakable astonishment, took God to\nwitness that he had done nothing to disoblige him, the governor began to\nthink, in sad earnest, that Peregrine's vivacity had at length risen to\nthe transports of actual madness, and was himself almost distracted with\nthis supposition. That he might the better judge what remedy ought to\nbe applied, he used his whole influence, and practised all his eloquence\nupon the youth, in order to learn the immediate cause of his delirium.\nHe employed the most pathetic entreaties, and even shed tears in the\ncourse of his supplication; so that Pickle, the first violence of the\nhurricane being blown over, was ashamed of his own imprudence, and\nretired to his chamber in order to recollect his dissipated thoughts;\nthere he shut himself up, and for the second time perusing the fatal\nepistle, began to waver in his opinion of the author's character and\nintention. He sometimes considered her as one of those nymphs, who,\nunder the mask of innocence and simplicity, practise upon the hearts and\npurses of unwary and inexperienced youths: this was the suggestion of\nhis wrath inflamed by disappointment; but when he reflected upon the\ncircumstances of her behaviour, and recalled her particular charms to\nhis imagination, the severity of his censure gave way and his heart\ndeclared in favour of her sincerity.\n\nYet even this consideration aggravated the sense of his loss, and he was\nin danger of relapsing into his former distraction, when his passion was\na little becalmed by the hope of seeing her again, either by accident\nor in the course of a diligent and minute inquiry, which he forthwith\nresolved to set on foot. He had reason to believe that her own heart\nwould espouse his cause in spite of her virtue's determination; and did\nnot despair of meeting with the Capuchin, whose good offices he knew he\ncould at any time command. Comforted with these reflections, the tempest\nof his soul subsided. In less than two hours he joined his company with\nan air of composure, and asked the painter's forgiveness for the freedom\nhe had taken, the cause of which he promised hereafter to explain.\nPallet was glad of being reconciled on any terms to one whose\ncountenance supported him in equilibrio with his antagonist the doctor;\nand Mr. Jolter was rejoiced beyond measure at his pupil's recovery.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX.\n\n\n\nPeregrine meets with Mrs. Hornbeck, and is consoled for his Loss--His\nValet-de-chambre is embroiled with her Duenna, whom, however, he finds\nmeans to appease.\n\n\nEverything having thus resumed its natural channel, they dined together\nin great tranquility. In the afternoon, Peregrine, on pretence of\nstaying at home to write letters, while his companions were at\nthe coffee-house, ordered a coach to be called, and, with his\nvalet-de-chambre, who was the only person acquainted with the present\nstate of his thoughts, set out for the promenade, to which all the\nladies of fashion resort in the evening during the summer season, in\nhopes of seeing his fugitive among the rest.\n\nHaving made a circuit round the walk, and narrowly observed every female\nin the place, he perceived at some distance the livery of Hornbeck upon\na lacquey that stood at the back of a coach; upon which he ordered his\nman to reconnoitre the said carriage, while he pulled up his glasses,\nthat he might not be discovered before he should have received some\nintelligence by which he might conduct himself on this unexpected\noccasion, that already began to interfere with the purpose of his coming\nthither, though it could not dispute his attention with the idea of his\ncharming unknown.\n\nHis Mercury, having made his observations, reported that there was\nnobody in the coach but Mrs. Hornbeck and an elderly woman, who had all\nthe air of a duenna; and that the servant was not the same footman who\nhad attended them in France. Encouraged by this information, our hero\nordered himself to be driven close up to that side of their convenience\non which his old mistress sat, and accosted her with the usual\nsalutation. This lady no sooner beheld her gallant than her cheeks\nreddened with a double glow, and she exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDear brother, I am\noverjoyed to see you! Pray come into our coach.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He took the hint\nimmediately, and, complying with her request, embraced this new sister\nwith great affection.\n\nPerceiving that her attendant was very much surprised and alarmed at\nthis unexpected meeting, she, in order to banish her suspicion, and at\nthe same time give her lover his cue, told him that his brother (meaning\nher husband) was gone to the Spa for a few weeks, by the advice of\nphysicians, on account of his ill state of health; and that, from his\nlast letter, she had the pleasure to tell him he was in a fair way of\ndoing well. The young gentleman expressed his satisfaction at this\npiece of news; observing, with an air of fraternal concern, that if\nhis brother had not made too free with his constitution, his friends in\nEngland would have had no occasion to repine at his absence and want of\nhealth, by which he was banished from his own country and connections.\nHe then asked, with an affectation of surprise, why she had not\naccompanied her spouse, and was given to understand that his tenderness\nof affection would not suffer him to expose her to the fatigues of the\njourney, which lay among rocks that were almost inaccessible.\n\nThe duenna's doubts being eased by this preamble of conversation, he\nchanged the subject to the pleasures of the place; and, among other\nsuch questions, inquired if she had as yet visited Versailles. This is\na public-house, situated upon the canal, at the distance of about\ntwo miles from town, and accommodated with tolerable gardens, for the\nentertainment of company. When she replied in the negative, he proposed\nto accompany her thither immediately; but the governante, who had\nhitherto sat silent, objected to this proposal; telling them, in broken\nEnglish, that as the lady was under her care, she could not answer to\nMr. Hornbeck for allowing her to visit such a suspicious place. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs\nfor that matter, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the confident gallant, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgive yourself no\ntrouble; the consequences shall be at my peril; and I will undertake to\ninsure you against my brother's resentment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he directed the\ncoachman to the place, and ordered his own to follow, under the auspices\nof his valet-de-chambre; while the old gentlewoman, overruled by his\nassurance, quietly submitted to his authority.\n\nBeing arrived at the place, he handed the ladies from the coach,\nand then, for the first time, observed that the duenna was lame, a\ncircumstance of which he did not scruple to take the advantage; for\nthey had scarce alighted, and drunk a glass of wine, when he advised his\nsister to enjoy a walk in the garden; and although the attendant made\nshift to keep them almost always in view, they enjoyed a detached\nconversation, in which Peregrine learned that the true cause of her\nbeing left behind at Brussels, whilst her husband proceeded to Spa, was\nhis dread of the company and familiarities of that place, to which his\njealousy durst not expose her; and that she had lived three weeks in a\nconvent at Lisle, from which she was delivered by his own free motion,\nbecause indeed he could no longer exist without her company; and,\nlastly, our lover understood that her governante was a mere dragon,\nwho had been recommended to him by a Spanish merchant, whose wife she\nattended to her dying day; but she very much questioned whether or not\nher fidelity was proof enough against money and strong waters. Peregrine\nassured her the experiment should be tried before parting; and they\nagreed to pass the night at Versailles, provided his endeavours should\nsucceed.\n\nHaving exercised themselves in this manner, until his duenna's spirits\nwere pretty much exhausted, that she might be the better\ndisposed to recruit them with a glass of liqueur, they returned to their\napartment, and the cordial was recommended and received in a bumper; but\nas it did not produce such a visible alteration as the sanguine hopes\nof Pickle had made him expect, and the old gentlewoman observed that it\nbegan to be late, and that the gates would be shut in a little time, he\nfilled up a parting glass, and pledged her in equal quantity. Her blood\nwas too much chilled to be warmed even by this extraordinary dose, which\nmade immediate innovation in the brain of our youth, who, in the gaiety\nof his imagination, overwhelmed this she-Argus with such profusion of\ngallantry, that she was more intoxicated with his expressions than with\nthe spirits she had drunk. When in the course of toying he dropped a\npurse into her bosom, she seemed to forget how the night wore, and,\nwith the approbation of her charge, assented to his proposal of having\nsomething for supper.\n\nThis was a great point which our adventurer had gained; and yet he\nplainly perceived that the governante mistook his meaning, by giving\nherself credit for all the passion he had professed. As this error could\nbe rectified by no other means than those of plying her with the bottle,\nuntil her distinguishing faculties should be overpowered, he promoted\na quick circulation. She did him justice, without any manifest signs of\ninebriation, so long, that his own eyes began to reel in the sockets,\nand he found that before his scheme could be accomplished, he should\nbe effectually unfitted for all the purposes of love. He therefore had\nrecourse to his valet-de-chambre, who understood the hint as soon as it\nwas given, and readily undertook to perform the part of which his master\nhad played the prelude. This affair being settled to his satisfaction,\nand the night at odds with morning, he took an opportunity of imparting\nto the ear of this aged dulcinea a kind whisper, importing a promise of\nvisiting her when his sister should be retired to her own chamber, and\nan earnest desire of leaving her door unlocked.\n\nThis agreeable intimation being communicated, he conveyed a caution of\nthe same nature to Mrs. Hornbeck, as he led her to her apartment; and\ndarkness and silence no sooner prevailed in the house, than he and his\ntrusted squire set out on their different voyages. Everything would have\nsucceeded according to their wish, had not the valet-de-chambre suffered\nhimself to fall asleep at the side of his inamorata, and, in the\nagitation of a violent dream, exclaimed in a voice so unlike that of her\nsupposed adorer, that she distinguished the difference at once. Waking\nhim with a pinch and a loud shriek, she threatened to prosecute him\nfor a rape, and reviled him with all the epithets her rage and\ndisappointment could suggest.\n\nThe Frenchman, finding himself detected, behaved with great temper and\naddress: he begged she would compose herself, on account of her own\nreputation, which was extremely dear to him; protesting that he had a\nmost inviolable esteem for her person. His representations had weight\nwith the duenna, who, upon recollection, comprehended the whole\naffair, and thought it would be her interest to bring matters to an\naccommodation. She therefore admitted the apologies of her bed-fellow,\nprovided he would promise to atone by marriage for the injury she had\nsustained; and in this particular he set her heart at ease by repeated\nvows, which he uttered with surprising volubility, though without any\nintention to perform the least title of their contents.\n\nPeregrine, who had been alarmed by her exclamation, and ran to the\ndoor with a view of interposing according to the emergency of the case,\noverhearing the affair thus compromised, returned to his mistress, who\nwas highly entertained with an account of what had passed, foreseeing\nthat for the future she should be under no difficulty or restriction\nfrom the severity of her guard.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX.\n\n\n\nHornbeck is informed of his Wife's Adventure with Peregrine, for whom he\nprepares a Stratagem, which is rendered ineffectual by the Information\nof Pipes--The Husband is ducked for his Intention, and our Hero\napprehended by the Patrol.\n\n\nThere was another person, however, still ungained; and that was no other\nthan her footman, whose secrecy our hero attempted to secure in the\nmorning by a handsome present, which he received with many professions\nof gratitude and devotion to his service; yet this complaisance was\nnothing but a cloak used to disguise the design he harboured of making\nhis master acquainted with the whole transaction. Indeed this lacquey\nhad been hired, not only as a spy upon his mistress, but also as a check\non the conduct of the governante, with promise of ample reward if ever\nhe should discover any sinister or suspicious practices in the course of\nher behaviour. As for the footman whom they had brought from England,\nhe was retained in attendance upon the person of his master, whose\nconfidence he had lost by advising him to gentle methods of reclaiming\nhis lady, when her irregularities had subjected her to his wrath.\n\nThe Flemish valet, in consequence of the office he had undertaken, wrote\nto Hornbeck by the first post, giving an exact detail of the adventure\nat Versailles, with such a description of the pretended brother as left\nthe husband no room to think he could be any other person than his first\ndishonourer; and exasperated him to such a degree, that he resolved\nto lay an ambush for this invader, and at once disqualify him from\ndisturbing his repose, by maintaining further correspondence with his\nwife.\n\nMeanwhile the lovers enjoyed themselves without restraint, and\nPeregrine's plan of inquiry after his dear unknown was for the present\npostponed. His fellow-travellers were confounded at his mysterious\nmotions, which filled the heart of Jolter with anxiety and terror.\nThis careful conductor was fraught with such experience of his pupil's\ndisposition, that he trembled with the apprehension of some sudden\naccident, and lived in continual alarm, like a man that walks under the\nwall of a nodding tower. Nor did he enjoy any alleviations of his fears,\nwhen, upon telling the young gentleman that the rest of the company were\ndesirous of departing for Antwerp, he answered, they were at liberty to\nconsult their own inclinations; but, for his own part, he was resolved\nto stay in Brussels a few days longer. By this declaration the governor\nwas confirmed in the opinion of his having some intrigue upon the anvil.\nIn the bitterness of his vexation, he took the liberty of signifying his\nsuspicion, and reminding him of the dangerous dilemmas to which he had\nbeen reduced by his former precipitation.\n\nPeregrine took his caution in good part, and promised to behave\nwith such circumspection as would screen him from any troublesome\nconsequences for the future: but, nevertheless, behaved that same\nevening in such a manner as plainly showed that his prudence was nothing\nelse than vain speculation. He had made an appointment to spend the\nnight, as usual, with Mrs. Hornbeck; and about nine o'clock hastened to\nher lodgings, when he was accosted in the street by his old discarded\nfriend Thomas Pipes, who, without any other preamble, told him, that for\nall he had turned him adrift, he did not choose to see him run full\nsail into his enemy's harbour, without giving him timely notice of the\ndanger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll tell you what,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmayhap you think I want to curry\nfavour, that I may be taken in tow again; if you do, you have made a\nmistake in your reckoning. I am old enough to be laid up, and have to\nkeep my planks from the weather. But this here is the affair: I have\nknown you since you were no higher than a marlinspike, and shouldn't\ncare to see you deprived of your rigging at these years; whereby I\nam informed by Hornbeck's man, whom I this afternoon fell in with by\nchance, as how his master has got intelligence of your boarding his\nwife, and has steered privately into this port with a large complement\nof hands, in order, d'ye see, to secure you while you are under the\nhatches. Now, if so be as how you have a mind to give him a salt eel for\nhis supper, here am I, without hope of fee or reward, ready to stand\nby you as long as my timbers will stick together: and if I expect any\nrecompense, may I be bound to eat oakum and drink bilge-water for life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nStartled at this information, Peregrine examined him upon the\nparticulars of his discourse with the lacquey; and when he understood\nthat Hornbeck's intelligence flowed from the canal of his Flemish\nfootman, he believed every circumstance of Tom's report, thanked him for\nhis warning, and, after having reprimanded him for his misbehaviour at\nLisle, assured him that it should be his own fault if ever they should\npart again. He then deliberated with himself whether or not he should\nretort the purpose upon his adversary; but when he considered that\nHornbeck was not the aggressor, and made that unhappy husband's case his\nown, he could not help quitting his intention of revenge; though, in his\nopinion, it ought to have been executed in a more honourable manner, and\ntherefore he determined to chastise him for his want of spirit. Nothing\nsurely can be more insolent and unjust than this determination, which\ninduced him to punish a person for his want of courage to redress the\ninjury which he himself had done to his reputation and peace; and yet\nthis barbarity of decision is authorised by the opinion and practice of\nmankind.\n\nWith these sentiments he returned to the inn, and, putting a pair of\npistols in his pocket, ordered his valet-de-chambre and Pipes to follow\nhim at a small distance, so as that they should be within call in\ncase of necessity, and then posted himself within thirty yards of his\ndulcinea's door. There he had not been above half an hour, when he\nperceived four men take their station on the other side, with a view, as\nhe guessed, to watch for his going in, that he might be taken unaware.\nBut when they had tarried a considerable time in that corner, without\nreaping the fruits of their expectation, their leader, persuaded that\nthe gallant had gained admittance by some secret means, approached the\ndoor with his followers, who, according to the instructions they had\nreceived, no sooner saw it opened, than they rushed in, leaving their\nemployer in the street, where he thought his person would be least\nendangered. Our adventurer, seeing him all alone, advanced with speed,\nand clapping a pistol to his breast, commanded him to follow his\nfootsteps without noise, on pain of immediate death.\n\nTerrified at this sudden apparition, Hornbeck obeyed in silence; and, in\na few minutes, they arrived at the quay, where Pickle, halting, gave\nhim to understand that he was no stranger to his villainous design; told\nhim, that if he conceived himself injured by any circumstance of his\nconduct, he would now give him an opportunity of resenting the wrong in\na manner becoming a man of honour. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have a sword about you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nhe; \u00e2\u0080\u009cor, if you don't choose to put the affair on that issue, here is a\nbrace of pistols; take which you please.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Such an address could not fail\nto disconcert a man of his character. After some hesitation, he, in a\nfaltering accent, denied that his design was to mutilate Mr. Pickle, but\nthat he thought himself entitled to the benefit of the law, by which he\nwould have obtained a divorce, if he could have procured evidence of his\nwife's infidelity; and, with that view, he had employed people to\ntake advantage of the information he had received. With regard to this\nalternative, he declined it entirely, because he could not see what\nsatisfaction he should enjoy in being shot through the head, or run\nthrough the lungs, by a person who had already wronged him in an\nirreparable manner. Lastly, his fear made him propose that the affair\nshould be left to the arbitration of two creditable men, altogether\nunconcerned in the dispute.\n\nTo these remonstrances Peregrine replied, in the style of a hot-headed\nyoung man, conscious of his own unjustifiable behaviour, that every\ngentleman ought to be a judge of his own honour and therefore he would\nsubmit to the decision of no umpire whatsoever; that he would forgive\nhis want of courage, which might be a natural infirmity, but his mean\ndissimulation he could not pardon. That, as he was certified of the\nrascally intent of his ambuscade by undoubted intelligence, he would\ntreat him, not with a retaliation of his own treachery, but with such\nindignity as a scoundrel deserves to suffer, unless he would make one\neffort to maintain the character he assumed in life. So saying, he again\npresented his pistols, which being rejected as before, he called his two\nministers, and ordered them to duck him in the canal.\n\nThis command was pronounced and executed almost in the same breath, to\nthe unspeakable terror and disorder of the poor shivering patient, who,\nhaving undergone the immersion, ran about like a drowned rat, squeaking\nfor assistance and revenge. His cries were overheard by the patrol,\nwho, chancing to pass that way, took him under their protection, and,\nin consequence of his complaint and information, went in pursuit of our\nadventurer and his attendants, who were soon overtaken and surrounded.\nRash and inconsiderate as the young gentleman was, he did not pretend\nto stand upon the defensive against a file of musketeers, although Pipes\nhad drawn his cutlass at their approach, but surrendered himself without\nopposition, and was conveyed to the main guard, where the commanding\nofficer, engaged by his appearance and address, treated him with all\nimaginable respect. Hearing the particulars of his adventure, he assured\nhim that the prince would consider the whole as a tour de jeunesse, and\norder him to be released without delay.\n\nNext morning, when this gentleman gave in his report, he made such a\nfavourable representation of the prisoner, that our hero was on the\npoint of being discharged, when Hornbeck preferred a complaint, accusing\nhim of a purposed assassination, and praying that such punishment should\nbe inflicted upon him as his highness should think adequate to the\nnature of the crime. The prince, perplexed with this petition, in\nconsequence of which he foresaw that he must disoblige a British\nsubject, sent for the plaintiff, of whom he had some knowledge, and, in\nperson, exhorted him to drop the prosecution, which would only serve to\npropagate his own shame. But Hornbeck was too much incensed to listen to\nany proposal of that kind, and peremptorily demanded justice against\nthe prisoner, whom he represented as an obscure adventurer, who had made\nrepeated attempts upon his honour and his life. Prince Charles told him,\nthat what he had advised was in the capacity of a friend; but, since he\ninsisted upon his acting as a magistrate, the affair should be examined,\nand determined according to the dictates of justice and truth.\n\nThe petitioner being dismissed with this promise, the defendant was, in\nhis turn, brought before the judge, whose prepossession in his favour\nwas in a great measure weakened by what his antagonist had said to the\nprejudice of his birth and reputation.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXI.\n\n\n\nPeregrine is released--Jolter confounded at his mysterious Conduct--A\nContest happens between the Poet and Painter, who are reconciled by the\nMediation of their Fellow-Travellers.\n\n\nOur hero, understanding from some expressions which escaped the prince,\nthat he was considered in the light of a sharper and assassin, begged\nthat he might have the liberty of sending for some vouchers, that would\nprobably vindicate his character from the malicious aspersions of his\nadversary. This permission being granted, he wrote a letter to\nhis governor, desiring that he would bring to him the letters of\nrecommendation which he had received from the British ambassador at\nParis, and such other papers as he thought conducive to evince the\nimportance of his situation.\n\nThe billet was given in charge to one of the subaltern officers on\nduty, who carried it to the inn, and demanded to speak with Mr. Jolter.\nPallet, who happened to be at the door when this messenger arrived,\nand heard him inquire for the tutor, ran directly to that gentleman's\napartment, and in manifest disorder, told him that a huge fellow of\na soldier, with a monstrous pair of whiskers, and fur cap as big as a\nbushel, was asking for him at the door. The poor governor began to shake\nat this intimation, though he was not conscious of having committed\nanything that could attract the attention of the state. When the officer\nappeared at his chamber door, his confusion increased to such a degree,\nthat his perception seemed to vanish, and the subaltern repeated the\npurport of his errand three times, before he could comprehend his\nmeaning, or venture to receive the letter which he presented. At length\nhe summoned all his fortitude, and having perused the epistle, his\nterror sank into anxiety. His ingenuous fear immediately suggested, that\nPeregrine was confined in a dungeon, for some outrage he had committed.\nHe ran with great agitation to a trunk, and, taking out a bundle of\npapers, followed his conductor, being attended by the painter, to whom\nhe had hinted his apprehension.\n\nWhen they passed through the guard, which was under arms, the hearts of\nboth died within them; and when they came into the presence, there was\nsuch an expression of awful horror on the countenance of Jolter, that\nthe prince, observing his dismay, was pleased to encourage him with an\nassurance that he had nothing to fear. Thus comforted, he recollected\nhimself so well as to understand his pupil, when he desired him to\nproduce the ambassador's letters; some of which being open, were\nimmediately read by his highness, who was personally acquainted with the\nwriter, and knew several of the noblemen to whom they were addressed.\nThese recommendations were so warm, and represented the young gentleman\nin such an advantageous light, that the prince, convinced of the\ninjustice his character had suffered by the misrepresentation of\nHornbeck, took our hero by the hand, asked pardon for the doubts he had\nentertained of his honour, declared him from that moment at liberty,\nordered his domestics to be enlarged, and offered him his countenance\nand protection as long as he should remain in the Austrian Netherlands.\nAt the same time, he cautioned him against indiscretion in the course\nof his gallantries; and took his word of honour, that he should drop\nall measures of resentment against the person of Hornbeck during his\nresidence in that place.\n\nThe delinquent, thus honourably acquitted, thanked the prince in the\nmost respectful manner for his generosity and candour, and retired with\nhis two friends, who were amazed and bewildered in their thoughts\nat what they had seen and heard, the whole adventure still remaining\nwithout the sphere of their comprehension, which was not at all\nenlarged by the unaccountable appearance of Pipes, who, with the\nvalet-de-chambre, joined them at the castle gate. Had Jolter been a man\nof a luxuriant imagination, his brain would undoubtedly have suffered in\nthe investigation of his pupil's mysterious conduct, which he strove in\nvain to unravel; but his intellects were too solid to be affected by the\nmiscarriage of his invention; and, as Peregrine did not think proper\nto make him acquainted with the cause of his being apprehended, he\ncontented himself with supposing that there was a lady in the case.\n\nThe painter, whose imagination was of a more flimsy texture, formed a\nthousand chimerical conjectures, which he communicated to Pickle,\nin imperfect insinuations, hoping, by his answers and behaviour, to\ndiscover the truth: but the youth, in order to tantalise him, eluded all\nhis inquiries, with such appearance of industry and art, as heightened\nhis curiosity, while it disappointed his aim, and inflamed him to such\na degree of impatience, that his wits began to be unsettled: then\nPeregrine was fain to recompose his brain, by telling him in confidence,\nthat he had been arrested as a spy. This secret he found more\nintolerable than his former uncertainty. He ran from one apartment to\nanother, like a goose in the agonies of egg-laying, with intention of\ndisburdening this important load; but Jolter being engaged with the\npupil, and all the people of the house ignorant of the only language\nhe could speak, he was compelled, with infinite reluctance, to address\nhimself to the doctor, who was at that time shut up in his own chamber.\nHaving knocked at the door to no purpose, he peeped through the\nkey-hole, and saw the physician sitting at a table, with a pen in one\nhand, and paper before him, his head reclined upon his other hand, and\nhis eyes fixed upon the ceiling, as if he had been entranced. Pallet,\nconcluding that he was under the power of some convulsion, endeavoured\nto force the door open, and the noise of his efforts recalled the doctor\nfrom his reverie.\n\nThis poetical republican, being so disagreeably disturbed, started up\nin a passion, and, opening the door, no sooner perceived who had\ninterrupted him, than he flung it in his face with great fury, and\ncursed him for his impertinent intrusion, which had deprived him of the\nmost delightful vision that ever regaled the human fancy. He imagined,\nas he afterwards imparted to Peregrine, that, as he enjoyed himself in\nwalking through the flowery plain that borders on Parnassus, he was met\nby a venerable sage, whom, by a certain divine vivacity that lightened\nfrom his eyes, he instantly knew to be the immortal Pindar. He was\nimmediately struck with reverence and awe, and prostrated himself before\nthe apparition, which, taking him by the hand, lifted him gently from\nthe ground and, with words more sweet than the honey of the Hybla\nbees, told him, that, of all the moderns, he alone was visited by\nthat celestial impulse by which he himself had been inspired, when he\nproduced his most applauded odes. So saying, he led him up the sacred\nhill, persuaded him to drink a copious draught of the waters of the\nHippocrene, and then presented him to the harmonious Nine, who crowned\nhis temples with a laurel wreath.\n\nNo wonder that he was enraged to find himself cut off from such sublime\nsociety. He raved in Greek against the invader, who was so big with\nhis own purpose, that, unmindful of the disgrace he had sustained, and\ndisregarding all the symptoms of the physician's displeasure, he applied\nhis mouth to the door, in an eager tone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll hold you any wager,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nhe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I guess the true cause of Mr. Pickle's imprisonment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To this\nchallenge he received no reply, and therefore repeated it, adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nsuppose you imagine he was taken up for fighting a duel, or affronting a\nnobleman, or lying with some man's wife, or some such matter: but, egad!\nyou was never more mistaken in your life; and I'll lay my Cleopatra\nagainst your Homer's head, that in four-and-twenty hours you shan't\nlight on the true reason.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe favourite of the muses, exasperated at this vexatious perseverance\nof the painter, who he imagined had come to tease and insult him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nwould,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009csacrifice a cock to Esculapius, were I assured that\nany person had been taken up for extirpating such a troublesome Goth as\nyou are from the face of the earth. As for your boasted Cleopatra, which\nyou say was drawn from your own wife, I believe the copy has as much\nas the original: but, were it mine, it should be hung up\nin the Temple of Cloacina, as the picture of that goddess; for any\nother apartment would be disgraced by its appearance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHark ye, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n replied Pallet, enraged in his turn at the contemptuous mention of his\ndarling performance, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou may make as free with my wife as you think\nproper, but 'ware my works; those are the children of my fancy,\nconceived by the glowing imagination, and formed by the art of my own\nhands: and you yourself are a Goth, and a Turk, and a Tartar, and\nan impudent pretending jackanapes, to treat with such disrespect a\nproduction which, in the opinion of all the connoisseurs of the age,\nwill, when finished, be a masterpiece in its kind, and do honour to\nhuman genius and skill. So I say again and again, and I care not\nthough your friend Playtor heard me, that you have no more taste than a\ndrayman's horse, and that those foolish notions of the ancients ought to\nbe drubbed out of you with a good cudgel, that you might learn to treat\nmen of parts with more veneration. Perhaps you may not always be in the\ncompany of one who will halloo for assistance when you are on the brink\nof being chastised for your insolence, as I did, when you brought upon\nyourself the resentment of that Scot, who, by the Lord! would have paid\nyou both Scot and lot, as Falstaff says, if the French officer had not\nput him in arrest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe physician, to this declamation, which was conveyed through the\nkey-hole, answered, that he (the painter) was a fellow so infinitely\nbelow his consideration, that his conscience upbraided him with no\naction of his life, except that of choosing such a wretch for his\ncompanion and fellow-traveller. That he had viewed his character through\nthe medium of good-nature and compassion, which had prompted him to give\nPallet an opportunity of acquiring some new ideas under his immediate\ninstruction; but he had abused his goodness and condescension in such a\nflagrant manner, that he was now determined to discard him entirely\nfrom his acquaintance; and desired him, for the present, to take himself\naway, on pain of being kicked for his presumption.\n\nPallet was too much incensed to be intimidated by this threat, which he\nretorted with great virulence, defying him to come forth, that it might\nappear which of them was best skilled in that pedestrian exercise, which\nhe immediately began to practise against the door with such thundering\napplication, as reached the ears of Pickle and his governor, who coming\nout into the passage, and seeing him thus employed, asked if he had\nforgot the chamber-pots of Alost, that he ventured to behave in such a\nmanner as entitled him to a second prescription of the same nature.\n\nThe doctor, understanding that there was company at hand, opened the\ndoor in a twinkling, and, springing upon his antagonist like a tiger, a\nfierce contention would have ensued, to the infinite satisfaction of\nour hero, had not Jolter, to the manifest peril of his own person,\ninterposed, and partly by force, and partly by exhortations, put a stop\nto the engagement before it was fairly begun. After having demonstrated\nthe indecency of such a vulgar rencontre, betwixt two fellow-citizens\nin a foreign land, he begged to know the cause of their dissension,\nand offered his good offices towards an accommodation. Peregrine also,\nseeing the fray was finished, expressed himself to the same purpose;\nand the painter, for obvious reasons, declining an explanation, his\nantagonist told the youth what a mortifying interruption he had suffered\nby the impertinent intrusion of Pallet, and gave him a detail of the\nparticulars of his vision, as above recited. The arbiter owned the\nprovocation was not to be endured; and decreed that the offender should\nmake some atonement for his transgression. Upon which the painter\nobserved, that, however he might have been disposed to make\nacknowledgments, if the physician had signified his displeasure like\na gentleman, the complainant had now forfeited all claim to any such\nconcessions, by the vulgar manner in which he had reviled him and his\nproductions; observing, that, if he (the painter) had been inclined to\nretort his slanderous insinuations, the republican's own works would\nhave afforded ample subject for his ridicule and censure.\n\nAfter divers disputes and representations, peace was at length\nconcluded, on condition, that, for the future, the doctor should never\nmention Cleopatra, unless he could say something in her praise; and that\nPallet, in consideration of his having been the first aggressor, should\nmake a sketch of the physician's vision, to be engraved and prefixed to\nthe next edition of his odes.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXII.\n\n\n\nThe Travellers depart for Antwerp, at which place the Painter gives a\nloose to his Enthusiasm.\n\n\nOur adventurer, baffled in all his efforts to retrieve his lost\nAmanda, yielded at length to the remonstrances of his governor and\nfellow-travellers, who, out of pure complaisance to him, had exceeded\ntheir intended stay by six days at least; and a couple of post-chaises,\nwith three riding-horses, being hired, they departed from Brussels in\nthe morning, dined at Mechlin, and arrived about eight in the evening\nat the venerable city of Antwerp. During this day's journey Pallet was\nelevated to an uncommon flow of spirits, with the prospect of seeing the\nbirthplace of Rubens, for whom he professed an enthusiastic admiration.\nHe swore, that the pleasure he felt was equal to that of a Mussulman, on\nthe last day of his pilgrimage to Mecca; and that he already considered\nhimself a native of Antwerp, being so intimately acquainted with their\nso justly boasted citizen, from whom, at certain junctures, he could\nnot help believing himself derived, because his own pencil adopted the\nmanner of that great man with surprising facility, and his face wanted\nnothing but a pair of whiskers and a beard, to exhibit the express\nimage of the Fleming's countenance. He told them he was so proud of this\nresemblance, that, in order to render it more striking, he had, at one\ntime of his life, resolved to keep his face sacred from the razor;\nand in that purpose had persevered, notwithstanding the continual\nreprehensions of Mrs. Pallet, (who, being then with child), said, his\naspect was so hideous, that she dreaded a miscarriage every hour, until\nshe threatened in plain terms, to dispute the sanity of his intellects,\nand apply to the chancellor for a committee.\n\nThe doctor, on this occasion, observed, that a man who is not proof\nagainst the solicitations of a woman, can never expect to make a great\nfigure in life; that painters and poets ought to cultivate no wives but\nthe Muses; or, if they are by the accidents of fortune encumbered with\nfamilies, they should carefully guard against that pernicious weakness,\nfalsely honoured with the appellation of natural affection, and pay no\nmanner of regard to the impertinent customs of the world. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGranting that\nyou had been for a short time deemed a lunatic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\nmight have acquitted yourself honourably of that imputation, by some\nperformance that would have raised your character above all censure.\nSophocles himself, that celebrated tragic poet, who, for the sweetness\nof his versification, was styled Melitta, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Bee,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in his old age,\nsuffered the same accusation from his own children, who, seeing him\nneglect his family affairs, and devote himself entirely to poetry,\ncarried him before the magistrate, as a man whose intellects were so\nmuch impaired by the infirmities of age, that he was no longer fit to\nmanage his domestic concerns; upon which the reverend bard produced his\ntragedy of Oidipus epi Kolono, as a work he had just finished; which\nbeing perused, instead of being declared unsound of understanding,\nhe was dismissed with admiration and applause. I wish your beard and\nwhiskers had been sanctioned by the like authority; though I am afraid\nyou would have been in the predicament of those disciples of a certain\nphilosopher, who drank decoctions of cummin seeds, that their faces\nmight adopt the paleness of their master's complexion, hoping that, in\nbeing as wan, they would be as learned as their teacher.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The painter,\nstung by this sarcasm, replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor like those virtuosi, who, by\nrepeating Greek, eating sillikicaby, and pretending to see visions,\nthink they equal the ancients in taste and genius.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The physician\nretorted, Pallet rejoined, and the altercation continued until they\nentered the gates of Antwerp, when the admirer of Rubens broke forth\ninto a rapturous exclamation, which put an end to the dispute and\nattracted the notice of the inhabitants, many of whom by shrugging up\ntheir shoulders and pointing to their foreheads, gave shrewd indications\nthat they believed him a poor gentleman disordered in his brain.\n\nThey had no sooner alighted at the inn, than this pseudo-enthusiast\nproposed to visit the great church, in which he had been informed some\nof his master's pieces were to be seen, and was remarkably chagrined,\nwhen he understood that he could not be admitted till next day. He rose\nnext morning by day-break, and disturbed his fellow-travellers in such a\nnoisy and clamorous manner, that Peregrine determined to punish him with\nsome new infliction, and, while he put on his clothes, actually\nformed the plan of promoting a duel between him and the doctor, in the\nmanagement of which, he promised himself store of entertainment, from\nthe behaviour of both.\n\nBeing provided with one of those domestics who are always in waiting\nto offer their services to strangers on their first arrival, they were\nconducted to the house of a gentleman who had an excellent collection\nof pictures; and though the greatest part of them were painted by his\nfavourite artist, Pallet condemned them all by the lump, because Pickle\nhad told him beforehand that there was not one performance of Rubens\namong the number.\n\nThe next place they visited was what is called the Academy of Painting,\nfurnished with a number of paltry pieces, in which our painter\nrecognised the style of Peter Paul, with many expressions of admiration,\non the same sort of previous intelligence.\n\nFrom this repository, they went to the great church; and being led\nto the tomb of Rubens, the whimsical painter fell upon his knees,\nand worshipped with such appearance of devotion, that the attendant,\nscandalized at his superstition, pulled him up, observing, with great\nwarmth, that the person buried in that place was no saint, but as great\na sinner as himself; and that, if he was spiritually disposed, there was\na chapel of the Blessed Virgin, at the distance of three yards on the\nright hand, to which he might retire. He thought it was incumbent upon\nhim to manifest some extraordinary inspiration, while he resided on the\nspot where Rubens was born; and, therefore, his whole behaviour was an\naffectation of rapture, expressed in distracted exclamations, convulsive\nstarts, and uncouth gesticulations. In the midst of this frantic\nbehaviour, he saw an old Capuchin, with a white beard, mount the pulpit,\nand hold forth to the congregation with such violence of emphasis and\ngesture, as captivated his fancy; and, bawling aloud, \u00e2\u0080\u009cZounds! what\nan excellent Paul preaching at Athens!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he pulled a pencil and a small\nmemorandum book from his pocket, and began to take a sketch of the\norator, with great eagerness and agitation, saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cEgad! friend\nRaphael, we shall see whether you or I have got the best knack at\ntrumping up an apostle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This appearance of disrespect gave offence to\nthe audience, who began to murmur against this heretic libertine; when\none of the priests belonging to the choir, in order to prevent any ill\nconsequence from their displeasure, came and told him in the French\nlanguage, that such liberties were not permitted in their religion, and\nadvised him to lay aside his implements, lest the people should take\numbrage at his design, and be provoked to punish him as a profane\nscoffer at their worship.\n\nThe painter, seeing himself addressed by a friar, who, while he spoke,\nbowed with great complaisance, imagined that he was a begging brother\ncome to supplicate his charity; and his attention being quite engrossed\nby the design he was making, he patted the priest's shaven crown with\nhis hand, saying, Oter tems, oter tems, and then resumed his pencil with\ngreat earnestness. The ecclesiastic, perceiving that the stranger did\nnot comprehend his meaning, pulled him by the sleeve, and explained\nhimself in the Latin tongue: upon which Pallet, provoked at his\nintrusion, cursed him aloud for an impudent beggarly son of a w--, and,\ntaking out a shilling, flung it upon the pavement, with manifest signs\nof indignation.\n\nSome of the common people, enraged to see their religion contemned, and\ntheir priests insulted at the very altar, rose from their seats, and,\nsurrounding the astonished painter, one of the number snatched his book\nfrom his hand, and tore it into a thousand pieces. Frightened as he was,\nhe could not help crying \u00e2\u0080\u009cFire and fagots! all my favourite ideas are\ngone to wreck!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and was in danger of being very roughly handled by the\ncrowd, had not Peregrine stepped in, and assured them, that he was a\npoor unhappy gentleman, who laboured under a transport of the brain.\nThose who understood the French language communicated this information\nto the rest, so that he escaped without any other chastisement than\nbeing obliged to retire. And as they could not see the famous Descent\nfrom the Cross till after the service was finished, they were conducted\nby their domestic to the house of a painter, where they found a\nbeggar standing for his picture, and the artist actually employed in\nrepresenting a huge louse that crawled upon his shoulder. Pallet was\nwonderfully pleased with this circumstance, which he said was altogether\na new thought, and an excellent hint, of which he would make his\nadvantage: and, in the course of his survey of this Fleming's\nperformances, perceiving a piece in which two flies were engaged upon\nthe carcass of a dog half devoured, he ran to his brother brush, and\nswore he was worthy of being a fellow-citizen of the immortal Rubens.\nHe then lamented, with many expressions of grief and resentment, that\nhe had lost his commonplace book, in which he had preserved a thousand\nconceptions of the same sort, formed by the accidental objects of\nhis senses and imagination; and took an opportunity of telling his\nfellow-travellers, that in execution he had equalled, if not\nexcelled, the two ancient painters who had vied with each other in the\nrepresentation of a curtain and a bunch of grapes; for he had exhibited\nthe image of a certain object so like to nature, that the bare sight of\nit set a whole hog-sty in an uproar.\n\nWhen he had examined and applauded all the productions of this minute\nartist, they returned to the great church, and were entertained with\nthe view of that celebrated masterpiece of Rubens, in which he has\nintroduced the portraits of himself and his whole family. The doors\nthat conceal this capital performance were no sooner unfolded, than our\nenthusiast, debarred the use of speech, by a previous covenant with his\nfriend Pickle, lifted up his hands and eyes, and putting himself in the\nattitude of Hamlet, when his father's ghost appears, adored in silent\necstasy and awe. He even made a merit of necessity; and, when they\nhad withdrawn from the place, protested that his whole faculties were\nswallowed up in love and admiration. He now professed himself more than\never enamoured of the Flemish school, raved in extravagant encomiums,\nand proposed that the whole company should pay homage to the memory\nof the divine Rubens, by repairing forthwith to the house in which he\nlived, and prostrating themselves on the floor of his painting-room.\n\nAs there was nothing remarkable in the tenement, which had been rebuilt\nmore than once since the death of that great man, Peregrine excused\nhimself from complying with the proposal, on pretence of being fatigued\nwith the circuit they had already performed. Jolter declined it for the\nsame reason; and the question being put to the doctor, he refused his\ncompany with an air of disdain. Pallet, piqued at his contemptuous\nmanner, asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif he would not go and see the habitation of Pindoor,\nprovided he was in the city where that poet lived?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and when the\nphysician observed, that there was an infinite difference between the\nmen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat I'll allow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the painter, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor the devil a poet ever\nlived in Greece or Troy, that was worthy to clean the pencils of our\nbeloved Rubens.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The physician could not, with any degree of temper\nand forbearance, hear this outrageous blasphemy, for which, he said,\nPallet's eyes ought to be picked out by owls; and the dispute arose,\nas usual, to such scurrilities of language, and indecency of behaviour,\nthat passengers began to take notice of their animosity, and Peregrine\nwas obliged to interpose for his own credit.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIII.\n\n\n\nPeregrine artfully foments a Quarrel between Pallet and the Physician,\nwho fight a Duel on the Ramparts.\n\n\nThe painter betook himself to the house of the Flemish Raphael, and\nthe rest of the company went back to their lodgings; where the young\ngentleman, taking the advantage of being alone with the physician,\nrecapitulated all the affronts he had sustained from the painter's\npetulance, aggravating every circumstance of the disgrace, and advising\nhim, in the capacity of a friend, to take care of his honour, which\ncould not fail to suffer in the opinion of the world, if he allowed\nhimself to be insulted with impunity, by one so much his inferior in\nevery degree of consideration.\n\nThe physician assured him, that Pallet had hitherto escaped\nchastisement, by being deemed an object unworthy his resentment, and\nin consideration of the wretch's family, for which his compassion was\ninterested; but that repeated injuries would inflame the most benevolent\ndisposition. And, though he could find no precedent of duelling among\nthe Greeks and Romans, whom he considered as the patterns of demeanour,\nPallet should no longer avail himself of his veneration for the\nancients, but be punished for the very next offence he should commit.\n\nHaving thus spirited up the doctor to a resolution from which he could\nnot decently swerve, our adventurer acted the incendiary with the other\nparty also; giving him to understand, that the physician treated his\ncharacter with such contempt, and behaved to him with such insolence, as\nno gentleman ought to bear: that, for his own part, he was every day put\nout of countenance by their mutual animosity, which appeared in nothing\nbut vulgar expressions, more becoming shoe-boys and oyster-women\nthan men of honour and education; and therefore he should be obliged,\ncontrary to his inclination, to break off all correspondence with them\nboth, if they would not fall upon some method to retrieve the dignity of\ntheir characters.\n\nThese representations would have had little effect upon the timidity of\nthe painter, who was likewise too much of a Grecian to approve of single\ncombat, in any other way than that of boxing, an exercise in which he\nwas well skilled, had they not been accompanied with an insinuation,\nthat his antagonist was no Hector, and that he might humble him into any\nconcession, without running the least personal risk. Animated by this\nassurance, our second Rubens set the trumpet of defiance to his mouth,\nswore he valued not his life a rush, when his honour was concerned, and\nentreated Mr. Pickle to be the bearer of a challenge, which he would\ninstantly commit to writing.\n\nThe mischievous fomenter highly applauded this manifestation of courage,\nby which he was at liberty to cultivate his friendship and society,\nbut declined the office of carrying the billet, that his tenderness of\nPallet's reputation might not be misinterpreted into an officious desire\nof promoting quarrels. At the same time, he recommended Tom Pipes, not\nonly as a very proper messenger on this occasion, but also as a trusty\nsecond in the field. The magnanimous painter took his advice, and,\nretiring to his chamber, penned a challenge in these terms:--\n\n     \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,--When I am heartily provoked, I fear not the devil\n     himself; much less--I will not call you a pedantic coxcomb,\n     nor an unmannerly fellow, because these are the hippethets of\n     the vulgar; but, remember, such as you are, I nyther love you\n     nor fear you; but, on the contrary, expect satisfaction for your\n     audacious behaviour to me on divers occasions; and will, this\n     evening, in the twilight, meet you on the ramparts with sword\n     and pistol, where the Lord have mercy on the soul of one of us,\n     for your body shall find no favour with your incensed defier\n     till death,\n                                      \u00e2\u0080\u009cLayman Pallet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis resolute defiance, after having been submitted to the perusal, and\nhonoured with the approbation of our youth, was committed to the charge\nof Pipes, who, according to his orders, delivered it in the afternoon;\nand brought for answer, that the physician would attend him at the\nappointed time and place. The challenger was evidently discomposed at\nthe unexpected news of this acceptance, and ran about the house in\ngreat disorder, in quest of Peregrine, to beg his further advice and\nassistance; but understanding that the youth was engaged in private with\nhis adversary, he began to suspect some collusion, and cursed himself\nfor his folly and precipitation. He even entertained some thoughts\nof retracting his invitation, and submitting to the triumph of his\nantagonist: but before he would stoop to this opprobrious condescension,\nhe resolved to try another expedient, which might be the means of saving\nboth his character and person. In this hope he visited Mr. Jolter, and\nvery gravely desired he would be so good as to undertake the office\nof his second in a duel which he was to fight that evening with the\nphysician.\n\nThe governor, instead of answering his expectation, in expressing\nfear and concern, and breaking forth into exclamations of \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood God!\ngentlemen, what d'ye mean? You shall not murder one another while it is\nin my power to prevent your purpose. I will go directly to the governor\nof the place, who shall interpose his authority--I say--\u00e2\u0080\u009d instead\nof these and other friendly menaces of prevention, Jolter heard the\nproposal with the most phlegmatic tranquility, and excused himself from\naccepting the honour he intended for him, on account of his character\nand situation, which would not permit him to be concerned in any such\nrencontres. Indeed, this mortifying reception was owing to a previous\nhint from Peregrine, who, dreading some sort of interruption from his\ngovernor, had made him acquainted with his design, and assured him, that\nthe affair should not be brought to any dangerous issue.\n\nThus disappointed, the dejected challenger was overwhelmed with\nperplexity and dismay; and, in the terrors of death or mutilation,\nresolved to deprecate the wrath of his enemy, and conform to any\nsubmission he should propose, when he was accidentally encountered by\nour adventurer, who, with demonstrations of infinite satisfaction, told\nhim in confidence, that the billet had thrown the doctor into an agony\nof consternation; that his acceptance of his challenge was a mere effort\nof despair, calculated to confound the ferocity of the sender, and\ndispose him to listen to terms of accommodation; that he had imparted\nthe letter to him with fear and trembling, on pretence of engaging him\nas a second, but, in reality, with a view of obtaining his good offices\nin promoting a reconciliation; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut, perceiving the situation of his\nmind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added our hero, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought it would be more for your honour to\nbaffle his expectation, and therefore I readily undertook the task of\nattending him to the field, in full assurance that he will there humble\nhimself before you, even to prostration. In this security, you may go\nand prepare your arms, and bespeak the assistance of Pipes, who will\nsquire you in the field, while I keep myself up, that our correspondence\nmay not be suspected by the physician.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pallet's spirits, that were\nsunk to dejection, rose at this encouragement to all the insolence of\ntriumph; he again declared his contempt of danger, and his pistols being\nloaded and accommodated with new flints, by his trusty armour-bearer, he\nwaited, without flinching, for the hour of battle.\n\nOn the first approach of twilight, somebody knocked at his door,\nand Pipes having opened it at his desire, he heard the voice of his\nantagonist pronounce, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTell Mr. Pallet that I am going to the place\nof appointment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The painter was not a little surprised at this\nanticipation, which so ill agreed with the information he had received\nfrom Pickle; and his concern beginning to recur, he fortified himself\nwith a large bumper of brandy, which, however, did not overcome the\nanxiety of his thoughts. Nevertheless, he set out on the expedition with\nhis second, betwixt whom and himself the following dialogue passed, in\ntheir way to the ramparts.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Pipes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the painter, with disordered accent, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmethinks the\ndoctor was in a pestilent hurry with that message of his.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cEy, ey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered Tom, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do suppose he longs to be foul of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n replied the other, \u00e2\u0080\u009cd'ye think he thirsts after my blood?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure\na does,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pipes, thrusting a large quid of tobacco in his check,\nwith great deliberation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf that be the case,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Pallet, beginning\nto shake, \u00e2\u0080\u009che is no better than a cannibal, and no Christian ought to\nfight him on equal footing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tom observing his emotion, eyed him with a\nfrown of indignation, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou an't afraid, are you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod forbid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n replied the challenger, stammering with fear; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat should I be afraid\nof? The worst he can do is to take my life, and then he'll be answerable\nboth to God and man for the murder. Don't you think he will?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think\nno such matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the second; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif so be as how he puts a brace\nof bullets through your bows, and kills you fairly, it is no more murder\nthan if I was to bring down a noddy from the main top-sail yard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBy this time Pallet's teeth chattered with such violence, that he could\nscarce pronounce this reply: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Thomas, you seem to make very light\nof a man's life; but I trust in the Almighty. I shall not be so easily\nbrought down. Sure many a man has fought a duel without losing his life.\nDo you imagine that I run such a hazard of falling by the hand of my\nadversary?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may or you may not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the unconcerned Pipes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust\nas it happens. What then? Death is a debt that every man owes, according\nto the song; and if you set foot to foot, I think one of you must go\nto pot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cFoot to foot!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the terrified painter: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat's\ndownright butchery; and I'll be d-- before I fight any man on earth in\nsuch a barbarous way. What! d'ye take me to be a savage beast?\u00e2\u0080\u009d This\ndeclaration he made while they ascended the ramparts.\n\nHis attendant perceiving the physician and his second at the distance\nof a hundred paces before them, gave him notice of their appearance,\nand advised him to make ready, and behave like a man. Pallet in vain\nendeavoured to conceal his panic, which discovered itself in a universal\ntrepidation of body, and the lamentable tone in which he answered this\nexhortation of Pipes, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do behave like a man; but you would\nhave me act the part of a brute. Are they coming this way?\u00e2\u0080\u009d When Tom\ntold him that they had faced about, and admonished him to advance,\nthe nerves of his arm refused their office, he could not hold out his\npistol, and instead of going forward, retreated with an insensibility\nof motion; till Pipes, placing himself in the rear, set his own back to\nthat of his principal, and swore he should not budge an inch farther in\nthat direction.\n\nWhile the valet thus tutored the painter, his master enjoyed the terrors\nof the physician, which were more ridiculous than those of Pallet,\nbecause he was more intent upon disguising them. His declaration to\nPickle in the morning would not suffer him to start any objections when\nhe received the challenge; and finding that the young gentleman made\nno offer of mediating the affair, but rather congratulated him on the\noccasion, when he communicated the painter's billet, all his efforts\nconsisted in oblique hints, and general reflections upon the absurdity\nof duelling, which was first introduced among civilised nations by the\nbarbarous Huns and Longobards. He likewise pretended to ridicule the use\nof firearms, which confounded all the distinctions of skill and address,\nand deprived a combatant of the opportunity of signalizing his personal\nprowess.\n\nPickle assented to the justness of his observations; but, at the same\ntime, represented the necessity of complying with the customs of this\nworld, ridiculous as they were, on which a man's honour and reputation\ndepend: so that, seeing no hopes of profiting by that artifice, the\nrepublican's agitation became more and more remarkable; and he proposed,\nin plain terms, that they should contend in armour, like the combatants\nof ancient days; for it was but reasonable that they should practise\nthe manner of fighting, since they adopted the disposition of those iron\ntimes.\n\nNothing could have afforded more diversion to our hero than the sight of\ntwo such duellists cased in iron; and he wished that he had promoted the\nquarrel in Brussels, where he could have hired the armour of Charles the\nFifth, and the valiant Duke of Parma, for their accommodation; but as\nthere was no possibility of furnishing them cap-a-pie at Antwerp, he\npersuaded him to conform to the modern use of the sword, and meet the\npainter on his own terms; and suspecting that his fear would supply him\nwith other excuses for declining the combat, he comforted him with some\ndistant insinuations, to the prejudice of his adversary's courage, which\nwould, in all probability, evaporate before any mischief could happen.\n\nNotwithstanding this encouragement, he could not suppress the reluctance\nwith which he went to the field, and cast many a wishful look over his\nleft shoulder, to see whether or not his adversary was at his heels.\nWhen, by the advice of his second, he took possession of the ground, and\nturned about with his face to the enemy, it was not so dark, but that\nPeregrine could perceive the unusual paleness of his countenance, and\nthe sweat standing in large drops upon his forehead; nay, there was a\nmanifest disorder in his speech, when he regretted his want of the pila\nand parma, with which he would have made a rattling noise, to astonish\nhis foe, in springing forward, and singing the hymn to battle, in the\nmanner of the ancients.\n\nIn the meantime, observing the hesitation of his antagonist, who, far\nfrom advancing, seemed to recoil, and even struggle with his second, he\nguessed the situation of the painter's thoughts, and, collecting all the\nmanhood that he possessed, seized the opportunity of profiting by\nhis enemy's consternation. Striking his sword and pistol together, he\nadvanced in a sort of trot, raising a loud howl, in which he repeated,\nin lieu of the Spartan song, part of the strophe from one of Pindar's\nPythia, beginning with ek theon gar makanoi pasai Broteais aretais,\netc. This imitation of the Greeks had all the desired effect upon the\npainter, who seeing the physician running towards him like a fury, with\na pistol in his right hand, which was extended, and hearing the dreadful\nyell he uttered, and the outlandish words he pronounced, was seized\nwith a universal palsy of his limbs. He would have dropped down upon\nthe ground, had not Pipes supported and encouraged him to stand upon his\ndefence. The doctor, contrary to his expectation, finding that he had\nnot flinched from the spot, though he had now performed one half of his\ncareer, put in practice his last effort, by firing his pistol, the noise\nof which no sooner reached the ears of the affrighted painter, than\nhe recommended his soul to God, and roared for mercy with great\nvociferation.\n\nThe republican, overjoyed at this exclamation, commanded him to yield,\nand surrender his arms, on pain of immediate death; upon which he threw\naway his pistols and sword, in spite of all the admonitions and even\nthreats of his second, who left him to his fate, and went up to his\nmaster, stopping his nose with signs of loathing and abhorrence.\n\nThe victor, having won the spolia opima, granted him his life, on\ncondition that he would on his knees supplicate his pardon, acknowledge\nhimself inferior to his conqueror in every virtue and qualification, and\npromise for the future to merit his favour by submission and respect.\nThese insolent terms were readily embraced by the unfortunate\nchallenger, who fairly owned, that he was not at all calculated for the\npurposes of war, and that henceforth he would contend with no weapon\nbut his pencil. He begged with great humility, that Mr. Pickle would not\nthink the worse of his morals for this defect of courage, which was a\nnatural infirmity inherited from his father, and suspend his opinion of\nhis talents, until he should have an opportunity of contemplating the\ncharms of his Cleopatra, which would be finished in less than three\nmonths.\n\nOur hero observed, with an affected air of displeasure, that no man\ncould be justly condemned for being subject to the impressions of fear,\nand therefore his cowardice might easily be forgiven: but there was\nsomething so presumptuous, dishonest, and disingenuous, in arrogating\na quality to which he knew he had not the smallest pretension, that\nhe could not forget his misbehaviour all at once, though he would\ncondescend to communicate with him as formerly, in hopes of seeking\na reformation in his conduct. Pallet protested, that there was no\ndissimulation in the case; for he was ignorant of his own weakness,\nuntil his resolution was put to the trial: he faithfully promised\nto demean himself, during the remaining part of the tour, with that\nconscious modesty and penitence which became a person in his condition;\nand, for the present, implored the assistance of Mr. Pipes, in\ndisembarrassing him from the disagreeable consequence of his fear.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIV.\n\n\n\nThe Doctor exults in his Victory--They set out for Rotterdam, where they\nare entertained by two Dutch Gentlemen in a Yacht, which is overturned\nin the Maese, to the manifest hazard of the Painter's Life--They spend\nthe Evening with their Entertainers, and next Day visit a Cabinet of\nCuriosities.\n\n\nTom was accordingly ordered to administer to his occasions; and\nthe conqueror, elated with his success, which he in a great measure\nattributed to his manner of attack, and the hymn which he howled, told\nPeregrine, that he was now convinced of the truth of what Pindar sung in\nthese words, ossa de me pephileke Zeus atuzontai boan Pieridon aionta;\nfor he had no sooner begun to repeat the mellifluent strains of that\ndivine poet, than the wretch his antagonist was confounded, and his\nnerves unstrung.\n\nOn their return to the inn, he expatiated on the prudence and\ntranquility of his own behaviour, and ascribed the consternation\nof Pallet to the remembrance of some crime that lay heavy upon his\nconscience; for, in his opinion, a man of virtue and common sense could\nnot possibly be afraid of death, which is not only the peaceful harbour\nthat receives him shattered on the tempestuous sea of life, but also the\neternal seal of his fame and glory, which it is no longer in his power\nto forfeit and forego. He lamented his fate, in being doomed to live in\nsuch degenerate days, when war is become a mercenary trade; and ardently\nwished, that the day would come, when he should have such an opportunity\nof signalizing his courage in the cause of liberty, as that of Marathon,\nwhere a handful of Athenians, fighting for their freedom, defeated the\nwhole strength of the Persian empire. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWould to heaven!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy\nmuse were blessed with an occasion to emulate that glorious testimony on\nthe trophy in Cyprus, erected by Cimon, for two great victories gained\non the same day over the Persians by sea and land; in which it is very\nremarkable, that the greatness of the occasion has raised the manner of\nexpression above the usual simplicity and modesty of all other ancient\ninscriptions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He then repeated it with all the pomp of declamation, and\nsignified his hope, that the French would one day invade us with such an\narmy as that which Xerxes led into Greece, that it might be in his power\nto devote himself, like Leonidas, to the freedom of his country.\n\nThis memorable combat being thus determined, and everything that was\nremarkable in Antwerp surveyed, they sent their baggage down the Scheldt\nto Rotterdam, and set out for the same place in a post-waggon, which\nthat same evening brought them in safety to the banks of the Maese. They\nput up at an English house of entertainment, remarkable for the modesty\nand moderation of the landlord; and next morning the doctor went in\nperson to deliver letters of recommendation to two Dutch gentlemen from\none of his acquaintance at Paris. Neither of them happened to be at home\nwhen he called; so that he left a message at their lodgings, with his\naddress; and in the afternoon, they waited upon the company, and, after\nmany hospitable professions, one of the two invited them to spend the\nevening at his house.\n\nMeanwhile they had provided a pleasure yacht, in which they proposed to\ntreat them with an excursion upon the Maese. This being almost the only\ndiversion that place affords, our young gentleman relished the proposal;\nand, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Mr. Jolter, who declined the\nvoyage on account of the roughness of the weather, they went on board\nwithout hesitation, and found a collation prepared in the cabin. While\nthey tacked to and fro in the river, under the impulse of a mackerel\nbreeze, the physician expressed his satisfaction, and Pallet was\nravished with the entertainment. But the wind increasing, to the\nunspeakable joy of the Dutchmen, who had now an opportunity of showing\ntheir dexterity in the management of the vessel, the guests found it\ninconvenient to stand upon deck, and impossible to sit below, on account\nof the clouds of tobacco smoke which rolled from the pipes of their\nentertainers, in such volumes as annoyed them even to the hazard of\nsuffocation. This fumigation, together with the extraordinary motion\nof the ship, began to affect the head and stomach of the painter, who\nbegged earnestly to be set on shore. But the Dutch gentlemen, who had no\nidea of his sufferings, insisted, with surprising obstinacy of regard,\nupon his staying until he should see an instance of the skill of the\nmariners; and, bringing him on deck, commanded the men to carry the\nvessel's lee gunwale under water. This nicety of navigation they\ninstantly performed, to the admiration of Pickle, the discomposure of\nthe doctor, and terror of Pallet, who blessed himself from the courtesy\nof a Dutchman, and prayed to Heaven for his deliverance.\n\nWhile the Hollanders enjoyed the reputation of this feat, and the\ndistress of the painter, at the same time, the yacht was overtaken by\na sudden squall, that overset her in a moment, and flung every man\noverboard into the Maese, before they could have the least warning of\ntheir fate, much less time to provide against the accident. Peregrine,\nwho was an expert swimmer, reached the shore in safety; the physician,\nin the agonies of despair, laid fast hold on the trunk-breeches of one\nof the men, who dragged him to the other side; the entertainers\nlanded at the bomb-keys, smoking their pipes all the way with great\ndeliberation; and the poor painter must have gone to the bottom, had not\nhe been encountered by the cable of a ship that lay at anchor near the\nscene of their disaster. Though his senses had forsaken him, his hands\nfastened by instinct on this providential occurrence, which he held with\nsuch a convulsive grasp, that, when a boat was sent out to bring him\non shore, it was with the utmost difficulty that his fingers were\ndisengaged. He was carried into a house, deprived of the use of speech,\nand bereft of all sensation; and, being suspended by the heels, a vast\nquantity of water ran out of his mouth. This evacuation being made, he\nbegan to utter dreadful groans, which gradually increased to a continued\nroar; and, after he had regained the use of his senses, he underwent\na delirium that lasted several hours. As for the treaters, they never\ndreamed of expressing the least concern to Pickle or the physician\nfor what had happened, because it was an accident so common as to pass\nwithout notice.\n\nLeaving the care of their vessel to the seamen, the company retired to\ntheir respective lodgings, in order to shift their clothes; and in the\nevening our travellers were conducted to the house of their new friend,\nwho, with a view of making his invitation the more agreeable, had\nassembled, to the number of twenty or thirty Englishmen, of all ranks\nand degrees, from the merchant to the periwig-maker's prentice.\n\nIn the midst of this congregation stood a chafing-dish with live coals,\nfor the convenience of lighting their pipes, and every individual was\naccommodated with a spitting-box. There was not a mouth in the apartment\nunfurnished with a tube, so that they resembled a congregation of\nchimeras breathing fire and smoke; and our gentlemen were fain to\nimitate their example in their own defence. It is not to be supposed\nthat the conversation was either very sprightly or polite; that the\nwhole entertainment was of the Dutch cast--frowzy and phlegmatic;\nand our adventurer, as he returned to his lodging, tortured with the\nheadache, and disgusted with every circumstance of his treatment, cursed\nthe hour in which the doctor had saddled them with such troublesome\ncompanions.\n\nNext morning by eight o'clock, these polite Hollanders returned the\nvisit, and, after breakfast, attended their English friends to the house\nof a person that possessed a very curious cabinet of curiosities,\nto which they had secured our company's admission. The owner of this\ncollection was a cheesemonger, who received them in a woollen nightcap,\nwith straps buttoned under his chin. As he understood no language but\nhis own, he told them, by the canal of one of their conductors, that he\ndid not make a practice of showing his curiosities; but understanding\nthat they were Englishmen, and recommended to his friends, he was\ncontent to submit them to their perusal. So saying, he led them up a\ndark stair, into a small room, decorated with a few paltry figures in\nplaster of Paris, two or three miserable landscapes, the skins of an\notter, seal, and some fishes stuffed; and in one corner stood a glass\ncase, furnished with newts, frogs, lizards, and serpents, preserved in\nspirits; a human foetus, a calf with two heads, and about two dozen of\nbutterflies pinned upon paper.\n\nThe virtuoso having exhibited these particulars, eyed the strangers with\na look soliciting admiration and applause; and as he could not perceive\nany symptom of either in their gestures or countenances, withdrew a\ncurtain, and displayed a wainscot chest of drawers, in which, he\ngave them to understand, was something that would agreeably amuse the\nimagination. Our travellers, regaled with this notice, imagined that\nthey would be entertained with the sight of some curious medals, or\nother productions of antiquity; but how were they disappointed, when\nthey saw nothing but a variety of shells, disposed in whimsical figures,\nin each drawer! After he had detained them full two hours with a tedious\ncommentary upon the shape, size, and colour of each department, he, with\na supercilious simper, desired that the English gentlemen would frankly\nand candidly declare, whether his cabinet, or that of Mynheer Sloane,\nat London, was the most valuable. When this request was signified in\nEnglish to the company, the painter instantly exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the Lard!\nthey are not to be named of a day. And as for that matter, I would not\ngive one corner of Saltero's coffee-house at Chelsea for all the trash\nhe hath shown.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Peregrine, unwilling to mortify any person who had done\nhis endeavour to please him, observed, that what he had seen was very\ncurious and entertaining; but that no private collection in Europe was\nequal to that of Sir Hans Sloane, which, exclusive of presents, had cost\nan hundred thousand pounds. The two conductors were confounded at this\nasseveration, which, being communicated to the cheesemonger, he shook\nhis head with a significant grin; and, though he did not choose to\nexpress his incredulity in words, gave our hero to understand, that\nhe did not much depend upon his veracity. From the house of this\nDutch naturalist, they were draggled all round the city by the painful\ncivility of their attendants, who did not quit them till the evening was\nwell advanced, and then not till after they had promised to be with\nthem before ten o'clock next day, in order to conduct them to a country\nhouse, situated in a pleasant village on the other side of the river.\n\nPickle was already so much fatigued with their hospitality, that, for\nthe first time of his life, he suffered a dejection of spirits; and\nresolved, at any rate, to avoid the threatened persecution of to-morrow.\nWith this view, he ordered his servants to pack up some clothes and\nlinen in a portmanteau; and in the morning embarked, with his governor,\nin the treckskuyt, for the Hague, whither he pretended to be called by\nsome urgent occasion, leaving his fellow-travellers to make his apology\nto their friends, and assuring them, that he would not proceed for\nAmsterdam without their society. He arrived at the Hague in the\nforenoon, and dined at an ordinary frequented by officers and people of\nfashion; where being informed that the princess would see company in the\nevening, he dressed himself in a rich suit of the Parisian cut, and went\nto court, without any introduction. A person of his appearance could not\nfail to attract the notice of such a small circle. The prince himself,\nunderstanding he was an Englishman and a stranger, went up to him\nwithout ceremony, and, having welcomed him to the place, conversed with\nhim for some minutes on the common topics of discourse.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXV.\n\n\n\nThey proceed to the Hague; from whence they depart for Amsterdam, where\nthey see a Dutch Tragedy--Visit the Music-house, in which Peregrine\nquarrels with the Captain of a Man-of-War--They pass through Haerlem, in\ntheir way to Leyden--Return to Rotterdam, where the Company separates,\nand our Hero, with his Attendants, arrive in safety at Harwich.\n\n\nBeing joined by their fellow-travellers in the morning, they made a\ntour to all the remarkable places in this celebrated village: saw the\nfoundry, the Stadthouse, the Spinhuys, Vauxhall, and Count Bentinck's\ngardens; and in the evening went to the French comedy, which was\ndirected by a noted harlequin, who had found means to flatter the Dutch\ntaste so effectually, that they extolled him as the greatest actor that\never appeared in the province of Holland. This famous company did not\nrepresent regular theatrical pieces, but only a sort of impromptus,\nin which this noted player always performed the greatest part of the\nentertainment. Among other sallies of wit that escaped him, there was\none circumstance so remarkably adapted to the disposition and genius of\nhis audience, that it were a pity to pass it over in silence. A windmill\nbeing exhibited on the scene, harlequin, after having surveyed it\nwith curiosity and admiration, asks one of the millers the use of that\nmachine; and being told that it was a windmill, observes, with some\nconcern, that as there was not the least breath of wind, he could not\nhave the pleasure of seeing it turn round. Urged by this consideration,\nhe puts himself into the attitude of a person wrapt in profound\nmeditation; and, having continued a few seconds in this posture, runs\nto the miller with great eagerness and joy, and, telling him that he\nhad found an expedient to make his mill work; very fairly unbuttons his\nbreeches. Then presenting his posteriors to the sails of the machine,\ncertain explosions are immediately heard, and the arms of the mill\nbegin to turn round, to the infinite satisfaction of the spectators, who\napprove the joke with loud peals of applause.\n\nOur travellers stayed a few days at the Hague, during which the young\ngentleman waited on the British ambassador, to whom he was recommended\nby his excellency at Paris, and lost about thirty guineas at billiards\nto a French adventurer, who decoyed him into the snare by keeping up his\ngame. Then they departed in a post-waggon for Amsterdam, being provided\nwith letters of introduction to an English merchant residing in that\ncity, under whose auspices they visited everything worth seeing,\nand among other excursions, went to see a Dutch tragedy acted, an\nentertainment which, of all others, had the strangest effect upon the\norgans of our hero; the dress of their chief personages was so antic,\ntheir manner so awkwardly absurd, and their language so ridiculously\nunfit for conveying the sentiment of love and honour, that Peregrine's\nnerves were diuretically affected with the complicated absurdity, and\nhe was compelled to withdraw twenty times before the catastrophe of the\npiece.\n\nThe subject of this performance was the famous story of Scipio's\ncontinence and virtue, in restoring the fair captive to her lover.\nThe young Roman hero was represented by a broadfaced Batavian, in a\nburgomaster's gown and a fur cap, sitting smoking his pipe at a table\nfurnished with a can of beer, a drinking glass, and a plate of tobacco.\nThe lady was such a person as Scipio might well be supposed to give\naway, without any great effort of generosity; and indeed the Celtiberian\nprince seemed to be of that opinion; for, upon receiving her from the\nhand of the victor, he discovered none of those transports of gratitude\nand joy which Livy describes in recounting this event. The Dutch Scipio,\nhowever, was complaisant enough in his way; for he desired her to sit at\nhis right hand, by the appellation of Ya frow, and with his own fingers\nfilling a clean pipe, presented it to Mynheer Allucio, the lover. The\nrest of the economy of the piece was in the same taste; which was so\nagreeable to the audience, that they seemed to have shaken off their\nnatural phlegm, in order to applaud the performance.\n\nFrom the play our company adjourned to the house of their friend, where\nthey spent the evening; and the conversation turning upon poetry, a\nDutchman who was present, and understood the English language, having\nlistened very attentively to the discourse, lifted up with both hands\nthe greatest part of a Cheshire cheese that lay upon the table, saying,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do know vat is boetre. Mine brotre be a great boet, and ave vrought\na book as dick as all dat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pickle, diverted with this method of\nestimating an author according to the quantity of his works, inquired\nabout the subjects of this bard's writings; but of these his brother\ncould give no account, or other information, but that there was little\nmarket for the commodity, which hung heavy upon his hands, and induced\nhim to wish he had applied himself to another trade.\n\nThe only remarkable scene in Amsterdam, which our company had not\nseen, was the Spuyl or music-houses, which, by the connivance of the\nmagistrates, are maintained for the recreation of those who might\nattempt the chastity of creditable women, if they were not provided\nwith such conveniences. To one of these night-houses did our travellers\nrepair, under the conduct of the English merchant, and were introduced\ninto such another place as the ever-memorable coffee-house of Moll King;\nwith this difference, that the company here were not so riotous as the\nbucks of Covent Garden, but formed themselves into a circle, within\nwhich some of the number danced to the music of a scurvy organ and a few\nother instruments, that uttered tunes very suitable to the disposition\nof the hearers, while the whole apartment was shrouded with clouds of\nsmoke impervious to the view. When our gentlemen entered, the floor was\noccupied by two females and their gallants, who, in the performance of\ntheir exercise, lifted their legs like so many oxen at plough and the\npipe of one of those hoppers happening to be exhausted, in the midst of\nhis saraband, he very deliberately drew forth his tobacco-box, filling\nand lighting it again, without any interruption to the dance.\n\nPeregrine being unchecked by the presence of his governor, who was too\ntender of his own reputation to attend them in this expedition, made up\nto a sprightly French girl who sat in seeming expectation of a customer,\nand prevailing upon her to be his partner, led her into the circle, and\nin his turn took the opportunity of dancing a minuet, to the admiration\nof all present. He intended to have exhibited another specimen of his\nability in this art, when a captain of a Dutch man-of-war chancing to\ncome in, and seeing a stranger engaged with the lady whom, it seems,\nhe had bespoke for his bedfellow, he advanced without any ceremony, and\nseizing her by the arm, pulled her to the other side of the room. Our\nadventurer, who was not a man to put up with such a brutal affront,\nfollowed the ravisher with indignation in his eyes; and pushing him on\none side, retook the subject of their contest, and led her back to the\nplace from whence she had been dragged. The Dutchman, enraged at the\nyouth's presumption, obeyed the first dictates of his choler, and lent\nhis rival a hearty box on the ear; which was immediately repaid with\ninterest, before our hero could recollect himself sufficiently to lay\nhis hand upon his sword, and beckon the aggressor to the door.\n\nNotwithstanding the confusion and disorder which this affair produced\nin the room, and the endeavours of Pickle's company, who interposed,\nin order to prevent bloodshed, the antagonists reached the street; and\nPeregrine drawing, was surprised to see the captain advance against\nhim with a long knife, which he preferred to the sword that hung by his\nside. The youth, confounded at this preposterous behaviour, desired him,\nin the French tongue, to lay aside that vulgar implement, and approach\nlike a gentleman. But the Hollander, who neither understood the\nproposal, nor would have complied with this demand, had he been made\nacquainted with his meaning, rushed forward like a desperado, before his\nadversary could put himself on his guard; and if the young gentleman had\nnot been endued with surprising agility, his nose would have fallen a\nsacrifice to the fury of the assailant. Finding himself in such imminent\njeopardy, he leaped to one side, and the Dutchman passing him, in the\nforce of his career, he with one nimble kick made such application to\nhis enemy's heels, that he flew like lightning into the canal, where he\nhad almost perished by pitching upon one of the posts with which it is\nfaced.\n\nPeregrine having performed this exploit, did not stay for the captain's\ncoming on shore, but retreated with all despatch, by the advice of his\nconductor; and next day embarked, with his companions, in the skuyt,\nfor Haerlem, where they dined; and in the evening arrived at the ancient\ncity of Leyden, where they met with some English students, who\ntreated them with great hospitality. Not but that the harmony of the\nconversation was that same night interrupted by a dispute that arose\nbetween one of those young gentlemen and the physician, about the\ncold and hot methods of prescription in the gout and rheumatism; and\nproceeded to such a degree of mutual reviling, that Pickle, ashamed\nand incensed at his fellow-traveller's want of urbanity, espoused the\nother's cause, and openly rebuked him for his unmannerly petulance,\nwhich, he said, rendered him unfit for the purposes, and unworthy of the\nbenefit, of society. This unexpected declaration overwhelmed the doctor\nwith amazement and confusion; he was instantaneously deprived of his\nspeech, and, during the remaining part of the party, sat in silent\nmortification. In all probability, he deliberated with himself, whether\nor not he should expostulate with the young gentleman on the freedom he\nhad taken with his character in a company of strangers; but as he knew\nhe had not a Pallet to deal with, he very prudently suppressed that\nsuggestion, and, in secret, chewed the cud of resentment.\n\nAfter they had visited the physic-garden, the university, the anatomical\nhall, and every other thing that was recommended to their view, they\nreturned to Rotterdam, and held a consultation upon the method of\ntransporting themselves to England. The doctor, whose grudge against\nPeregrine was rather inflamed than allayed by our hero's indifference\nand neglect, had tampered with the simplicity of the painter, who was\nproud of his advances towards a perfect reconciliation, and now took the\nopportunity of parting with our adventurer, by declaring that he and\nhis friend Mr. Pallet were resolved to take their passage in a trading\nsloop, after he had heard Peregrine object against that tedious,\ndisagreeable, and uncertain method of conveyance. Pickle immediately saw\nhis intention, and, without using the least argument to dissuade them\nfrom their design, or expressing the smallest degree of concern at their\nseparation, very coolly wished them a prosperous voyage, and ordered his\nbaggage to be sent to Helvoetsluys. There he himself, and his retinue,\nwent on board of the packet next day, and, by the favour of a fair wind,\nin eighteen hours arrived at Harwich.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVI.\n\n\n\nPeregrine delivers his Letters of Recommendation at London, and returns\nto the Garrison, to the unspeakable joy of the Commodore and his whole\nFamily.\n\n\nNow that our hero found himself on English ground, his heart dilated\nwith the proud recollection of his own improvement since he left his\nnative soil. He began to recognise the interesting ideas of his tender\nyears; he enjoyed, by anticipation, the pleasure of seeing his friends\nin the garrison, after an absence of eighteen months; and the image\nof his charming Emily, which other less worthy considerations had\ndepressed, resumed the full possession of his breast. He remembered,\nwith shame, that he had neglected the correspondence with her brother,\nwhich he himself had solicited, and in consequence of which he had\nreceived a letter from that young gentleman, while he lived at Paris. In\nspite of these conscientious reflections he was too self-sufficient to\nthink he should find any difficulty in obtaining forgiveness for\nsuch sins of omission; and began to imagine that his passion would\nbe prejudicial to the dignity of his situation, if it should not be\ngratified upon terms which formerly his imagination durst not conceive.\n\nSorry I am, that the task I have undertaken, lays me under the necessity\nof divulging this degeneracy in the sentiment of our imperious youth,\nwho was now in the heyday of his blood, flushed with the consciousness\nof his own qualifications, vain of his fortune, and elated on the\nwings of imaginary expectation. Though he was deeply enamoured of Miss\nGauntlet, he was far from proposing her heart as the ultimate aim of\nhis gallantry, which, he did not doubt, would triumph over the most\nillustrious females of the land, and at once regale his appetite and\nambition.\n\nMeanwhile, being willing to make his appearance at the garrison equally\nsurprising and agreeable, he cautioned Mr. Jolter against writing to the\ncommodore, who had not heard of them since their departure from Paris,\nand hired a post-chaise and horses, for London. The governor, going out\nto give orders about the carriage, inadvertently left a paper book open\nupon the table; and his pupil, casting his eyes upon the page, chanced\nto read these words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSept. 15. Arrived in safety, by the blessing of\nGod, in this unhappy kingdom of England. And thus concludes the journal\nof my last peregrination.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Peregrine's curiosity being inflamed by this\nextraordinary conclusion he turned to the beginning, and perused several\nsheets of a diary such as is commonly kept by that class of people known\nby the denomination of travelling governors, for the satisfaction of\nthemselves and the parents or guardians of their pupils, and for the\nedification and entertainment of their friends.\n\nThat the reader may have a clear idea of Mr. Jolter's performance, we\nshall transcribe the transactions of one day, as he had recorded them;\nand that abstract will be a sufficient specimen of the whole plan and\nexecution of the work.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMay 3. At eight o'clock, set out from Boulogne in a post-chaise: the\nmorning hazy and cold. Fortified my stomach with a cordial. Recommended\nditto to Mr. P. as an antidote against the fog. Mem. He refused it.\nThe hither horse greased in the off-pastern of the hind leg. Arrived\nat Samers. Mem. This last was a post and a half, i.e. three leagues, or\nnine English miles. The day clears up. A fine champaign country, well\nstored with corn. The postillion says his prayers in passing by a wooden\ncrucifix upon the road. Mem. The horses staled in a small brook that\nruns in a bottom, betwixt two hills. Arrived at Cormont. A common post.\nA dispute with my pupil, who is obstinate, and swayed by an unlucky\nprejudice. Proceed to Montreuil, where we dine on choice pigeons. A very\nmoderate charge. No chamber-pot in the room, owing to the negligence of\nthe maid. This is an ordinary post. Set out again for Nampont. Troubled\nwith flatulences and indigestion. Mr. P. is sullen, and seems to mistake\nan eructation for the breaking of wind backwards. From Nampont depart\nfor Bernay, at which place we arrive in the evening, and propose to\nstay all night. N.B. The two last a redouble posts, and our cattle\nvery willing, though not strong. Sup on a delicate ragout and excellent\npartridges, in company with Mr. H. and his spouse. Mem. The said H.\ntrod upon my corn by mistake. Discharge the bill, which is not very\nreasonable. Dispute with Mr. P. about giving money to the servant. He\ninsists upon my giving a twenty-four sol piece, which is too much by\ntwo-thirds, in all conscience. N.B. She was a pert baggage, and did not\ndeserve a liard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOur hero was so much disobliged with certain circumstances of this\namusing and instructing journal, that, by way of punishing the author,\nhe interlined these words betwixt two paragraphs, in a manner that\nexactly resembled the tutor's handwriting: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMem. Had the pleasure of\ndrinking myself into a sweet intoxication, by toasting our lawful king,\nand his royal family, among some worthy English fathers of the Society\nof Jesus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaving taken this revenge, he set out for London, where he waited upon\nthose noblemen to whom he had letters of recommendation from Paris;\nand was not only graciously received, but even loaded with caresses and\nproffers of service, because they understood he was a young gentleman\nof fortune, who, far from standing in need of their countenance or\nassistance, would make a useful and creditable addition to the number\nof their adherents. He had the honour of dining at their tables, in\nconsequence of pressing invitations, and of spending several evenings\nwith the ladies, to whom he was particularly agreeable, on account of\nhis person, address, and bleeding freely at play.\n\nBeing thus initiated in the beau monde, he thought it was high time\nto pay his respects to his generous benefactor, the commodore; and,\naccordingly, departed one morning, with his train, for the garrison,\nat which he arrived in safety the same night. When he entered the gate,\nwhich was opened by a new servant that did not know him, he found his\nold friend, Hatchway, stalking in the yard, with a nightcap on his head,\nand a pipe in his mouth; and, advancing to him, took him by the hand\nbefore he had any intimation of his approach. The lieutenant, thus\nsaluted by a stranger, stared at him in silent astonishment, till he\nrecollected his features, which were no sooner known, than, dashing\nhis pipe upon the pavement, he exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSmite my cross-trees! th'art\nwelcome to port;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and hugged him in his arms with great affection. He\nthen, by a cordial squeeze, expressed his satisfaction at seeing his old\nshipmate, Tom, who, applying his whistle to his mouth, the whole castle\nechoed with his performance.\n\nThe servants, hearing the well-known sound, poured out in a tumult of\njoy; and, understanding that their young master was returned, raised\nsuch a peal of acclamation, as astonished the commodore and his lady,\nand inspired Julia with such an interesting presage, that her heart\nbegan to throb with violence. Running out in the hurry and perturbation\nof her hope, she was so much overwhelmed at sight of her brother, that\nshe actually fainted in his arms. But from this trance she soon awaked;\nand Peregrine, having testified his pleasure and affection, went\nupstairs, and presented himself before his godfather and aunt. Mrs.\nTrunnion rose and received him with a gracious embrace, blessing God for\nhis happy return from a land of impiety and vice, in which she hoped his\nmorals had not been corrupted, nor his principles of religion altered or\nimpaired. The old gentleman being confined to his chair, was struck dumb\nwith pleasure at his appearance; and, having made divers ineffectual\nefforts to get up, at length discharged a volley of curses against his\nown limbs, and held out his hand to his godson, who kissed it with great\nrespect.\n\nAfter he had finished his apostrophe to the gout, which was the daily\nand hourly subject of his execrations, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, my lad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\ncare not how soon I go to the bottom, now I behold thee safe in harbour\nagain; and yet I tell a d--d lie; I would I could keep afloat until I\nshould see a lusty boy of thy begetting. Odds my timbers! I love thee\nso well, that I believe thou art the spawn of my own body; though I can\ngive no account of thy being put upon the stocks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then, turning his\neyes upon Pipes, who by this time had penetrated into his apartment, and\naddressed him with the usual salutation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat cheer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAhey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried\nhe, \u00e2\u0080\u009care you there, you herring-faced son of a sea-calf? What a slippery\ntrick you played your old commander! But come, you dog, there's my fist;\nI forgive you, for the love you bear to my godson. Go, man your tackle,\nand hoist a cask of strong beer into the yard, knock out the bung, and\nput a pump in it, for the use of all my servants and neighbours; and,\nd'ye hear, let the patereroes be fired, and the garrison illuminated,\nas rejoicings for the safe arrival of your master. By the Lord! if I had\nthe use of these d--d shambling shanks, I would dance a hornpipe with\nthe best of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe next object of his attention was Mr. Jolter, who was honoured with\nparticular marks of distinction, and the repeated promise of enjoying\nthe living in his gift, as an acknowledgment of the care and discretion\nwith which he had superintended the education and morals of our hero.\nThe governor was so affected by the generosity of his patron, that the\ntears ran down his cheeks, while he expressed his gratitude, and the\ninfinite satisfaction he felt in contemplating the accomplishments of\nhis pupil.\n\nMeanwhile, Pipes did not neglect the orders he had received. The beer\nwas produced, the gates were thrown open for the admission of all\ncomers, the whole house was lighted up, and the patereroes were\ndischarged in repeated volleys. Such phenomena could not fail to attract\nthe notice of the neighbourhood. The club at Tunley's were astonished\nat the report of the guns, which produced various conjectures among the\nmembers of that sagacious society. The landlord observed, that, in all\nlikelihood, the commodore was visited by hobgoblins, and ordered the\nguns to be fired in token of distress, as he had acted twenty years\nbefore, when he was annoyed by the same grievance. The exciseman, with\na waggish sneer, expressed his apprehension of Trunnion's death,\nin consequence of which the patereroes might be discharged with an\nequivocal intent, either as signals of his lady's sorrow or rejoicing.\nThe attorney signified a suspicion of Hatchway's being married to Miss\nPickle, and that the firing and illuminations were in honour of the\nnuptials; upon which Gamaliel discovered some faint signs of emotion,\nand, taking the pipe from his mouth, gave it as his opinion, that his\nsister was brought to bed.\n\nWhile they were thus bewildered in the maze of their own imaginations,\na company of countrymen, who sat drinking in the kitchen, and whose legs\nwere more ready than their invention, sallied out to know the meaning\nof these exhibitions. Understanding that there was a butt of strong beer\nabroach in the yard, to which they were invited by the servants, they\nsaved themselves the trouble and expense of returning to spend the\nevening at the public-house, and listed themselves under the banner of\nTom Pipes, who presided as director of this festival.\n\nThe news of Peregrine's return being communicated to the parish, the\nparson, and three or four neighbouring gentlemen, who were well-wishers\nto our hero, immediately repaired to the garrison, in order to pay their\ncompliments on this happy event, and were detained to supper. An elegant\nentertainment was prepared by the direction of Miss Julia, who was an\nexcellent housewife; and the commodore was so invigorated with joy, that\nhe seemed to have renewed his age. Among those who honoured the occasion\nwith their presence, was Mr. Clover, the young gentleman that made his\naddresses to Peregrine's sister. His heart was so big with his passion,\nthat, while the rest of the company were engrossed by their cups,\nhe seized an opportunity of our hero's being detached from the\nconversation, and, in the impatience of his love, conjured him to\nconsent to his happiness; protesting, that he would comply with any\nterms of settlement that a man of his fortune could embrace, in favour\nof a young lady who was absolute mistress of his affection.\n\nOur youth thanked him very politely for his favourable sentiments and\nhonourable intention towards his sister, and told him, that at present\nhe saw no reason to obstruct his desire; that he would consult Julia's\nown inclinations, and confer with him about the means of gratifying his\nwish; but, in the meantime, begged to be excused from discussing any\npoint of such importance to them both. Reminding him of the jovial\npurpose on which they were happily met, he promoted such a quick\ncirculation of the bottle, that their mirth grew noisy and obstreperous;\nthey broke forth into repeated peals of laughter, without any previous\nincitement except that of claret. These explosions were succeeded by\nBacchanalian songs, in which the old gentleman himself attempted to\nbear a share; the sedate governor snapped time with his fingers, and the\nparish priest assisted in the chorus with a most expressive nakedness\nof countenance. Before midnight they were almost all pinned to their\nchairs, as if they had been fixed by the power of enchantment; and, what\nrendered the confinement still more unfortunate, every servant in the\nhouse was in the same situation; so that they were fain to take their\nrepose as they sat, and nodded at each other like a congregation of\nAnabaptists.\n\nNext day Peregrine communed with his sister on the subject of her match\nwith Mr. Clover, who, she told him, had offered to settle a jointure of\nfour hundred pounds, and take her to wife without any expectation of a\ndowry. She moreover gave him to understand, that, in his absence, she\nhad received several messages from her mother, commanding her to return\nto her father's house; but that she had refused to obey these orders,\nby the advice and injunction of her aunt and the commodore, which were\nindeed seconded by her own inclination; because she had all the reason\nin the world to believe, that her mother only wanted an opportunity of\ntreating her with severity and rancour. The resentment of that lady\nhad been carried to such indecent lengths, that, seeing her daughter at\nchurch one day, she rose up, before the parson entered, and reviled her\nwith great bitterness, in the face of the whole congregation.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVII.\n\n\n\nSees his Sister happily married--Visits Emilia, who receives him\naccording to his Deserts.\n\n\nHer brother being of opinion, that Mr. Clover's proposal was not to\nbe neglected, especially as Julia's heart was engaged in his favour,\ncommunicated the affair to his uncle, who, with the approbation of\nMrs. Trunnion, declared himself well satisfied with the young man's\naddresses, and desired that they might be buckled with all expedition,\nwithout the knowledge or concurrence of her parents, to whom (on account\nof their unnatural barbarity) she was not bound to pay the least regard.\nThough our adventurer entertained the same sentiments of the matter,\nand the lover, dreading some obstruction, earnestly begged the immediate\ncondescension of his mistress, she could not be prevailed upon to take\nsuch a material step, without having first solicited the permission of\nher father; resolved, nevertheless, to comply with the dictates of her\nown heart, should his objections be frivolous or unjust.\n\nUrged by this determination, her admirer waited upon Mr. Gamaliel at the\npublic-house, and, with the appearance of great deference and respect,\nmade him acquainted with his affection for his daughter, communicated\nthe particulars of his fortune, with the terms of settlement he was\nready to make; and in conclusion told him, that he would marry her\nwithout a portion. This last offer seemed to have some weight with the\nfather, who received it with civility, and promised in a day or two to\nfavour him with a final answer to his demand. He, accordingly, that same\nevening consulted his wife, who, being exasperated at the prospect of\nher daughter's independency, argued with the most virulent expostulation\nagainst the match, as an impudent scheme of her own planning, with a\nview of insulting her parents, towards whom she had already been guilty\nof the most vicious disobedience. In short, she used such remonstrances,\nas not only averted this weak husband's inclination from the proposal\nwhich he had relished before, but even instigated him to apply for a\nwarrant to apprehend his daughter, on the supposition that she was about\nto bestow herself in marriage without his privity or consent.\n\nThe justice of peace to whom this application was made, though he could\nnot refuse the order, yet, being no stranger to the malevolence of the\nmother, which, together with Gamaliel's simplicity, was notorious in the\ncounty, he sent an intimation of what had happened to the garrison; upon\nwhich a couple of sentinels were placed on the gate, and at the pressing\nsolicitation of the lover, as well as the desire of the commodore, her\nbrother, and aunt, Julia was wedded without further delay, the ceremony\nbeing performed by Mr. Jolter, because the parish priest prudently\ndeclined any occasion of giving offence, and the curate was too much in\nthe interest of their enemies to be employed in that office.\n\nThis domestic concern being settled to the satisfaction of our hero, he\nescorted her next day to the house of her husband, who immediately wrote\na letter to her father, declaring his reasons for having thus superseded\nhis authority; and Mrs. Pickle's mortification was unspeakable.\n\nThat the new-married couple might be guarded against all insult, our\nyoung gentleman and his friend Hatchway, with their adherents, lodged\nin Mr. Clover's house for some weeks; during which they visited their\nacquaintance in the neighbourhood, according to custom. When the\ntranquility of their family was perfectly established, and the contract\nof the marriage executed in the presence of the old commodore and his\nlady, who gave her niece five hundred pounds to purchase jewels and\nclothes, Mr. Peregrine could no longer restrain his impatience to see\nhis dear Emily; and told his uncle, that next day he proposed to ride\nacross the country, in order to visit his friend Gauntlet, whom he had\nnot heard of for a long time.\n\nThe old gentleman, looking steadfastly in his face, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! D--n your\ncunning!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI find the anchor holds fast! I did suppose as how\nyou would have slipt your cable, and changed your berth; but, I see,\nwhen a young fellow is once brought up by a pretty wench, he may man his\ncapstans and viol block, if he wool; but he'll as soon heave up the Pike\nof Teneriffe, as bring his anchor aweigh! Odds heartlikins! had I known\nthe young woman was Ned Gauntlet's daughter, I shouldn't have thrown out\nsignal for leaving off chase.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOur adventurer was not a little surprised to hear the commodore talk\nin this style; and immediately conjectured that his friend Godfrey\nhad informed him of the whole affair. Instead of listening to this\napprobation of his flame, with those transports of joy which he would\nhave felt, had he retained his former sentiments, he was chagrined at\nTrunnion's declaration, and offended at the presumption of the young\nsoldier, in presuming to disclose the secret with which he had entrusted\nhim. Reddening with these reflections, he assured the commodore that he\nnever had serious thoughts of matrimony; so that if any person had told\nhim he was under any engagement of that kind, he had abused his ear; for\nhe protested that he would never contract such attachments without his\nknowledge and express permission.\n\nTrunnion commended him for his prudent resolution, and observed, that,\nthough no person mentioned to him what promises had passed betwixt him\nand his sweetheart, it was very plain that he had made love to her, and\ntherefore it was to be supposed that his intentions were honourable; for\nhe could not believe he was such a rogue in his heart, as to endeavour\nto debauch the daughter of a brave officer, who had served his country\nwith credit and reputation. Notwithstanding this remonstrance, which\nPickle imputed to the commodore's ignorance of the world, he set out for\nthe habitation of Mrs. Gauntlet, with the unjustifiable sentiments of a\nman of pleasure, who sacrifices every consideration to the desire of his\nruling appetite; and, as Winchester lay in his way, resolved to visit\nsome of his friends who lived in that place. It was in the house of one\nof these that he was informed of Emilia's being then in town with her\nmother; upon which he excused himself from staying to drink tea, and\nimmediately repaired to their lodgings, according to the directions he\nhad received.\n\nWhen he arrived at the door, instead of undergoing that perturbation of\nspirits, which a lover in his interesting situation might be supposed to\nfeel, he suffered no emotion but that of vanity and pride, favoured with\nan opportunity of self-gratification, and entered his Emilia's apartment\nwith the air of a conceited petit-maitre, rather than that of the\nrespectful admirer, when he visits the object of his passion, after an\nabsence of seventeen months.\n\nThe young lady, having been very much disobliged at his mortifying\nneglect of her brother's letter, had summoned all her own pride and\nresolution to her aid; and, by means of a happy disposition, so far\novercame her chagrin at his indifference, that she was able to behave in\nhis presence with apparent tranquility and ease. She was even pleased\nto find he had, by accident, chosen a time for his visit when she was\nsurrounded by two or three young gentlemen, who professed themselves her\nadmirers. Our gallant was no sooner announced, than she collected all\nher coquetry, put on the gayest air she could assume, and contrived\nto giggle just as he appeared at the room door. The compliments of\nsalutation being performed, she welcomed him to England in a careless\nmanner, asked the news of Paris, and, before he could make any reply,\ndesired one of the other gentlemen to proceed with the sequel of that\ncomical adventure, in the relation of which he had been interrupted.\n\nPeregrine smiled within himself at this behaviour, which, without all\ndoubt, he believed she had affected to punish him for his unkind silence\nwhile he was abroad, being fully persuaded that her heart was absolutely\nat his devotion. On this supposition, he practised his Parisian\nimprovements on the art of conversation, and uttered a thousand\nprettinesses in the way of compliment, with such incredible rotation of\ntongue, that his rivals were struck dumb with astonishment, and Emilia\nfretted out of all temper, at seeing herself deprived of the prerogative\nof the sex. He persisted, however, in this surprising loquacity, until\nthe rest of the company thought proper to withdraw, and then contracted\nhis discourse into the focus of love, which now put on a very different\nappearance from that which it had formerly worn. Instead of awful\nveneration, which her presence used to inspire, that chastity of\nsentiment, and delicacy of expression, he now gazed upon her with the\neyes of a libertine, he glowed with the impatience of desire, talked in\na strain that barely kept within the bounds of decency, and attempted\nto snatch such favours, as she, in the tenderness of mutual\nacknowledgments, had once vouchsafed to bestow.\n\nGrieved and offended as she was, at this palpable alteration in his\ncarriage, she disdained to remind him of his former deportment, and,\nwith dissembled good-humour, rallied him on the progress he had made\nin gallantry and address. But, far from submitting to the liberties he\nwould have taken, she kept her person sacred from his touch, and would\nnot even suffer him to ravish a kiss of her fair hand; so that he\nreaped no other advantage from the exercise of his talents, during\nthis interview, which lasted a whole hour, than that of knowing he had\noverrated his own importance, and that Emily's heart was not a garrison\nlikely to surrender at discretion.\n\nAt length his addresses were interrupted by the arrival of the mother,\nwho had gone abroad to visit by herself; and the conversation becoming\nmore general, he understood that Godfrey was at London, soliciting for a\nlieutenancy that had fallen vacant in the regiment to which he belonged;\nand that Miss Sophy was at home with her father.\n\nThough our adventurer had not met with all the success he expected by\nhis first visit, he did not despair of reducing the fortress, believing\nthat in time there would be a mutiny in his favour, and accordingly\ncarried on the siege for several days, without profiting by his\nperseverance; till, at length, having attended the ladies to their\nown house in the country, he began to look upon this adventure as time\nmisspent, and resolved to discontinue his attack, in hopes of meeting\nwith a more favourable occasion; being, in the meantime, ambitious of\ndisplaying in a higher sphere, those qualifications which his vanity\ntold him were at present misapplied.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\n\n\n\nHe attends his Uncle with great Affection during a Fit of Illness--Sets\nout again for London--Meets with his Friend Godfrey, who is prevailed\nupon to accompany him to Bath; on the Road to which Place they chance\nto Dine with a Person who entertains them with a curious Account of a\ncertain Company of Adventurers.\n\n\nThus determined, he took leave of Emilia and her mother, on pretence of\ngoing to London upon some urgent business, and returned to the garrison,\nleaving the good old lady very much concerned, and the daughter incensed\nat his behaviour, which was the more unexpected, because Godfrey had\ntold them that the commodore approved of his nephew's passion.\n\nOur adventurer found his uncle so ill of the gout, which, for the first\ntime, had taken possession of his stomach, that his life was in imminent\ndanger, and the whole family in disorder. He therefore took the reins\nof government in his own hands, sent for all the physicians in the\nneighbourhood, and attended him in person with the most affectionate\ncare, during the whole fit, which lasted a fortnight, and then retired\nbefore the strength of his constitution.\n\nWhen the old gentleman recovered his health, he was so penetrated with\nPeregrine's behaviour, that he actually would have made over to him his\nwhole fortune, and depended upon him for his own subsistence, had not\nour youth opposed the execution of the deed with all his influence\nand might, and even persuaded him to make a will, in which his friend\nHatchway, and all his other adherents, were liberally remembered,\nand his aunt provided for on her own terms. This material point being\nsettled, he, with his uncle's permission, departed for London, after\nhaving seen the family affairs established under the direction and\nadministration of Mr. Jolter and the lieutenant; for, by this time, Mrs.\nTrunnion was wholly occupied with her spiritual concern.\n\nOn his first arrival at London, he sent a card to the lodgings of\nGauntlet, in consequence of a direction from his mother; and that young\ngentleman waited on him next morning, though not with that alacrity of\ncountenance and warmth of friendship which might have been expected\nfrom the intimacy of their former connection. Nor was Peregrine himself\nactuated by the same unreserved affection for the soldier which he had\nformerly entertained. Godfrey, over and above the offence he had taken\nat Pickle's omission in point of corresponding with him, had been\ninformed, by a letter from his mother, of the youth's cavalier behaviour\nto Emilia, during his last residence at Winchester; and our young\ngentleman, as we have already observed, was disgusted at the supposed\ndiscovery which the soldier had made in his absence to the commodore.\nThey, perceived their mutual umbrage at meeting, and received each other\nwith that civility of reserve which commonly happens between two persons\nwhose friendship is in the wane.\n\nGauntlet at once divined the cause of the other's displeasure, and, in\norder to vindicate his own character, after the first compliments were\npassed, took the opportunity, on inquiring after the health of the\ncommodore, to tell Peregrine, that, while he tarried at the garrison,\non his return from Dover, the subject of the conversation, one night,\nhappening to turn on our hero's passion, the old gentleman had expressed\nhis concern about that affair; and, among other observations, said,\nhe supposed the object of his love was some paltry hussy, whom he had\npicked up when he was a boy at school. Upon which, Mr. Hatchway assured\nhim, that she was a young woman of as good a family as any in the\ncounty; and, after having prepossessed him in her favour, ventured,\nout of the zeal of his friendship, to tell who she was. Wherefore, the\ndiscovery was not to be imputed to any other cause; and he hoped Mr.\nPickle would acquit him of all share in the transaction.\n\nPeregrine was very well pleased to be thus undeceived; his countenance\nimmediately cleared up, the formality of his behaviour relaxed into\nhis usual familiarity; he asked pardon for his unmannerly neglect of\nGodfrey's letter, which he protested, was not owing to any disregard,\nor abatement of friendship, but to a hurry of youthful engagements, in\nconsequence of which he had procrastinated his answer from time to time,\nuntil he was ready to return in person.\n\nThe young soldier was contented with this apology and, as Pickle's\nintention, with respect to his sister, was still dubious and undeclared,\nhe did not think it was incumbent upon him, as yet, to express any\nresentment on that score; but was wise enough to foresee, that the\nrenewal of his intimacy with our young gentleman might be the means of\nreviving that flame which had been dissipated by a variety of new\nideas. With those sentiments, he laid aside all reserve, and their\ncommunication resumed its former channel. Peregrine made him acquainted\nwith all the adventures in which he had been engaged since their\nparting; and he, with the same confidence, related the remarkable\nincidents of his own fate; among other things, giving him to understand,\nthat, upon obtaining a commission in the army, the father of his dear\nSophy, without once inquiring about the occasion of his promotion, had\nnot only favoured him with his countenance in a much greater degree than\nheretofore, but also contributed his interest, and even promised the\nassistance of his purse, in procuring for him a lieutenancy, which he\nwas then soliciting with all his power; whereas, if he had not been\nenabled, by a most accidental piece of good fortune, to lift himself\ninto the sphere of an officer, he had all the reason in the world to\nbelieve that this gentleman, and all the rest of his wealthy relations,\nwould have suffered him to languish in obscurity and distress; and by\nturning his misfortune into reproach, made it a plea for their want of\ngenerosity and friendship.\n\nPeregrine, understanding the situation of his friend's affairs, would\nhave accommodated him upon the instant with a sum to accelerate the\npassage of his commission through the offices; but, being too well\nacquainted with his scrupulous disposition, to manifest his benevolence\nin that manner, he found means to introduce himself to one of the\ngentlemen of the War Office, who was so well satisfied with the\narguments used in behalf of his friend, that Godfrey's business was\ntransacted in a very few days, though he himself knew nothing of his\ninterest being thus reinforced.\n\nBy this time, the season at Bath was begun; and our hero, panting with\nthe desire of distinguishing himself at that resort of the fashionable\nworld, communicated his design of going thither to his friend Godfrey,\nwhom he importuned to accompany him in the excursion; and leave of\nabsence from his regiment being obtained by the influence of Peregrine's\nnew quality friends, the two companions departed from London in a\npost-chaise, attended, as usual, by the valet-de-chambre and Pipes, who\nwere become almost as necessary to our adventurer as any two of his own\norgans.\n\nAt the inn, when they alighted for dinner, Godfrey perceived a person\nwalking by himself in the yard, with a very pensive air, and, upon\nobserving him more narrowly, recognised him to be a professed gamester,\nwhom he had formerly known at Tunbridge. On the strength of this\nacquaintance, he accosted the peripatetic, who knew him immediately;\nand, in the fulness of his grief and vexation, told him, that he was\nnow on his return from Bath, where he had been stripped by a company\nof sharpers, who resented that he should presume to trade upon his own\nbottom.\n\nPeregrine, who was extremely curious in his inquiries, imagining that\nhe might learn some entertaining and useful anecdotes from this artist,\ninvited him to dinner, and was accordingly fully informed of all the\npolitical systems at Bath. He understood that there was at London one\ngreat company of adventurers, who employed agents in all the different\nbranches of imposition throughout the whole kingdom of England, allowing\nthese ministers a certain proportion of the profits accruing from their\nindustry and skill, and reserving the greatest share for the benefit of\nthe common stock, which was chargeable with the expense of fitting\nout individuals in their various pursuits, as well as with the loss\nsustained in the course of their adventures. Some whose persons and\nqualifications are by the company judged adequate to the task, exert\ntheir talents in making love to ladies of fortune, being accommodated\nwith money and accoutrements for that purpose, after having given their\nbonds payable to one or other of the directors, on the day of marriage,\nfor certain sums, proportioned to the dowries they are to receive.\nOthers versed in the doctrine of chances, and certain secret\nexpediences, frequent all those places where games of hazard are\nallowed: and such as are masters in the arts of billiards, tennis,\nand bowls, are continually lying in wait, in all the scenes of\nthese diversions, for the ignorant and unwary. A fourth class attend\nhorse-races, being skilled in those mysterious practices by which the\nknowing ones are taken in. Nor is this community unfurnished with those\nwho lay wanton wives and old rich widows under contribution, and extort\nmoney, by prostituting themselves to the embraces of their own sex,\nand then threatening their admirers with prosecution. But their most\nimportant returns are made by that body of their undertakers who\nexercise their understandings in the innumerable stratagems of the card\ntable, at which no sharper can be too infamous to be received, and even\ncaressed by persons of the highest rank and distinction. Among other\narticles of intelligence, our young gentleman learned, that those\nagents, by whom their guest was broke, and expelled from Bath, had\nconstituted a bank against all sporters, and monopolized the advantage\nin all sorts of play. He then told Gauntlet, that, if he would put\nhimself under his direction, he would return with them, and lay such a\nscheme as would infallibly ruin the whole society at billiards, as he\nknew that Godfrey excelled them all in his knowledge of that game.\n\nThe soldier excused himself from engaging in any party of that kind, and\nafter dinner the travellers parted; but, as the conversation between\nthe two friends turned upon the information they had received, Peregrine\nprojected a plan for punishing those villainous pests of society,\nwho prey upon their fellow-creatures; and it was put in execution by\nGauntlet in the following manner.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIX.\n\n\n\nGodfrey executes a Scheme at Bath, by which a whole Company of Sharpers\nis ruined.\n\n\nOn the evening after their arrival at Bath, Godfrey, who had kept\nhimself up all day for that purpose, went in boots to the billiard\ntable; and, two gentlemen being at play, began to bet with so little\nappearance of judgment, that one of the adventurers then present was\ninflamed with a desire of profiting by his inexperience; and, when the\ntable was vacant, invited him to take a game for amusement. The soldier,\nassuming the air of a self-conceited dupe, answered, that he did not\nchoose to throw away his time for nothing, but, if he pleased, would\npiddle for a crown a game. This declaration was very agreeable to\nthe other, who wanted to be further confirmed in the opinion he\nhad conceived of the stranger, before he would play for anything of\nconsequence. The party being accepted, Gauntlet put off his coat,\nand, beginning with seeming eagerness, won the first game, because his\nantagonist kept up his play with a view of encouraging him to wager\na greater sum. The soldier purposely bit at the hook, the stakes\nwere doubled, and he was again victorious, by the permission of his\ncompetitor. He now began to yawn; and observing, that it was not worth\nhis while to proceed in such a childish manner; the other swore, in\nan affected passion, that he would play him for twenty guineas. The\nproposal being embraced, through the connivance of Godfrey, the money\nwas won by the sharper, who exerted his dexterity to the utmost, fearing\nthat otherwise his adversary would decline continuing the game.\n\nGodfrey thus conquered, pretended to lose his temper, cursed his own\nill-luck, swore that the table had a cast, and that the balls did not\nrun true, changed his mast, and with great warmth, challenged his enemy\nto double the sum. The gamester, who feigned reluctance, complied with\nhis desire; and having got the two first hazards, offered to lay one\nhundred guineas to fifty on the game. The odds were taken; and Godfrey\nhaving allowed himself to be overcome, began to rage with great\nviolence, broke the mast to pieces, threw the balls out of the window,\nand, in the fury of his indignation, defied his antagonist to meet him\ntomorrow, when he should be refreshed from the fatigue of travelling.\nThis was a very welcome invitation to the gamester, who, imagining that\nthe soldier would turn out a most beneficial prize, assured him, that\nhe would not fail to be there next forenoon, in order to give him his\nrevenge.\n\nGauntlet went home to his lodgings, fully certified of his own\nsuperiority, and took his measures with Peregrine, touching the\nprosecution of their scheme; while his opponent made a report of his\nsuccess to the brethren of the gang, who resolved to be present at the\ndecision of the match, with a view of taking advantage of the stranger's\npassionate disposition.\n\nAffairs being thus concerted on both sides, the players met, according\nto appointment, and the room was immediately filled with spectators,\nwho either came thither by accident, curiosity, or design. The match\nwas fixed for one hundred pounds a game, the principals chose their\ninstruments, and laid aside their coats, and one of the knights of the\norder proffered to lay another hundred on the head of his associate.\nGodfrey took him upon the instant. A second worthy of the same class,\nseeing him so eager, challenged him to treble the sum; and his proposal\nmet with the same reception, to the astonishment of the company, whose\nexpectation was raised to a very interesting pitch. The game was begun,\nand the soldier having lost the first hazard, the odds were offered by\nthe confederacy with great vociferation; but nobody would run such a\nrisk in favour of a person who was utterly unknown. The sharper having\ngained the second also, the noise increased to a surprising clamour, not\nonly of the gang, but likewise of almost all the spectators, who desired\nto lay two to one against the brother of Emilia.\n\nPeregrine, who was present, perceiving the cupidity of the association\nsufficiently inflamed, all of a sudden opened his mouth, and answered\ntheir bets, to the amount of twelve hundred pounds; which were\nimmediately deposited, on both sides, in money and notes; so that this\nwas, perhaps, the most important game that ever was played at billiards.\nGauntlet seeing the agreement settled, struck his antagonist's ball\ninto the pocket in a twinkling, though it was in one of those situations\nwhich are supposed to be against the striker. The betters were a little\ndiscomposed at this event, for which, however, they consoled themselves\nby imputing the success to accident; but when, at the very next\nstroke, he sprung it over the table, their countenances underwent an\ninstantaneous distraction of feature, and they waited, in the most\ndreadful suspense, for the next hazard, which being likewise taken with\ninfinite ease by the soldier, the blood forsook their cheeks, and the\ninterjection \u00e2\u0080\u009cZounds!\u00e2\u0080\u009d pronounced with a look of consternation, and in a\ntone of despair, proceeded from every mouth at the same instant of\ntime. They were overwhelmed with horror and astonishment at seeing\nthree hazards taken in as many strokes, from a person of their\nfriend's dexterity; and shrewdly suspected, that the whole was a scheme\npreconcerted for their destruction. On this supposition, they changed\nthe note, and attempted to hedge for their own indemnification, by\nproposing to lay the odds in favour of Gauntlet; but so much was the\nopinion of the company altered by that young gentleman's success,\nthat no one would venture to espouse the cause of his competitor, who,\nchancing to improve his game by the addition of another lucky hit,\ndiminished the concern, and revived the hopes of his adherents.\n\nBut this gleam of fortune did not long continue. Godfrey collected\nhis whole art and capacity, and, augmenting his score to number ten,\nindulged himself with a view of the whole fraternity. The visages of\nthese professors had adopted different shades of complexion at every\nhazard he had taken: from their natural colour they had shifted into\na sallow hue; from thence into pale; from pale into yellow, which\ndegenerated into a mahogany tint; and now they saw seventeen hundred\npounds of their stock depending upon a single stroke, they stood like so\nmany swarthy Moors, jaundiced with terror and vexation. The fire which\nnaturally glowed in the cheeks and nose of the player, seemed utterly\nextinct, and his carbuncles exhibited a livid appearance, as if a\ngangrene had already made some progress in his face; his hand began to\nshake, and his whole frame was seized with such trepidation, that he\nwas fain to swallow a bumper of brandy, in order to re-establish the\ntranquility of his nerves. This expedient, however, did not produce\nthe desired effect; for he aimed the ball at the lead with such\ndiscomposure, that it struck on the wrong side, and came off at an\nangle which directed it full in the middle hole. This fatal accident was\nattended with a universal groan, as if the whole universe had gone to\nwreck; and notwithstanding that tranquility for which adventurers are so\nremarkable, this loss made such an impression upon them all, that each\nin particular manifested his chagrin, by the most violent emotions. One\nturned up his eyes to heaven, and bit his nether lip; another gnawed\nhis fingers, while he stalked across the room; a third blasphemed with\nhorrid imprecations; and he who played the party sneaked off, grinding\nhis teeth together, with a look that baffles all description, and as he\ncrossed the threshold, exclaiming, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA d--d bite, by G--!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe victors, after having insulted them, by asking, if they were\ndisposed for another chance, carried off their winning, with the\nappearance of great composure, though in their hearts they were\ntransported with unspeakable joy; not so much on account of the booty\nthey had gained, as in consideration of having so effectually destroyed\nsuch a nest of pernicious miscreants.\n\nPeregrine, believing that now he had found an opportunity of serving his\nfriend, without giving offence to the delicacy of his honour, told him,\nupon their arrival at their lodgings, that fortune had at length enabled\nhim to become in a manner independent, or at least make himself easy in\nhis circumstances, by purchasing a company with the money he had won.\nSo saying, he put his share of the success in Gauntlet's hand, as a sum\nthat of right belonged to him, and promised to write in his behalf to\na nobleman, who had interest enough to promote such a quick rise in the\nservice.\n\nGodfrey thanked him for his obliging intention, but absolutely refused,\nwith great loftiness of demeanour, to appropriate to his own use any\npart of the money which Pickle had gained, and seemed affronted at the\nother's entertaining a sentiment so unworthy of his character. He would\nnot even accept, in the way of loan, such an addition to his own stock,\nas would amount to the price of a company of foot; but expressed great\nconfidence in the future exertion of that talent which had been blessed\nwith such a prosperous beginning. Our hero finding him thus obstinately\ndeaf to the voice of his own interest, resolved to govern himself in\nhis next endeavours of friendship, by his experience of this ticklish\npunctilio; and, in the meantime, gave a handsome benefaction to the\nhospital, out of these first fruits of the success in play, and reserved\ntwo hundred pounds for a set of diamond ear-rings and solitaire, which\nhe intended for a present to Miss Emily.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXX.\n\n\n\nThe two Friends eclipse all their Competitors in Gallantry, and practise\na pleasant Project of Revenge upon the Physicians of the Place.\n\n\nThe fame of their exploit against the sharpers was immediately diffused\nthrough all the companies at Bath; so that, when our adventurers\nappeared in public, they were pointed out by an hundred extended\nfingers, and considered as consummate artists in all the different\nspecies of finesse, which they would not fail to practise with the first\nopportunity. Nor was this opinion of their characters any obstacle to\ntheir reception into the fashionable parties in the place; but, on the\ncontrary, such a recommendation, which, as I have already hinted, never\nfails to operate for the advantage of the possessor.\n\nThis first adventure, therefore, served them as an introduction to\nthe company at Bath, who were not a little surprised to find their\nexpectations baffled by the conduct of the two companions; because,\nfar from engaging deeply at play, they rather shunned all occasions of\ngaming, and directed their attention to gallantry, in which our hero\nshone unrivalled. His external qualifications, exclusive of any other\nmerit, were strong enough to captivate the common run of the female sex;\nand these, reinforced with a sprightliness of conversation, and a\nmost insinuating address, became irresistible, even by those who were\nfortified with pride, caution, or indifference. But, among all the\nnymphs of this gay place, he did not meet with one object that disputed\nthe empire of his heart with Emilia, and therefore he divided his\nattachment according to the suggestions of vanity and whim; so that,\nbefore he had resided a fortnight at Bath, he had set all the ladies\nby the ears, and furnished all the hundred tongues of scandal with full\nemployment. The splendour of his appearance excited the inquiries of\nenvy, which, instead of discovering any circumstances to his prejudice,\nwas cursed with the information of his being a young gentleman of a good\nfamily, and heir to an immense fortune.\n\nThe countenance of some of his quality friends, who arrived at Bath,\nconfirmed this piece of intelligence. Upon which his acquaintance\nwas courted and cultivated with great assiduity; and he met with such\nadvances from some of the fair sex, as rendered him extremely fortunate\nin his amours. Nor was his friend Godfrey a stranger to favours of the\nsame kind; his accomplishments were exactly calculated for the meridian\nof female taste; and, with certain individuals of that sex, his muscular\nframe, and the robust connection of his limbs, were more attractive\nthan the delicate proportions of his companion. He accordingly reigned\nparamount among those inamoratas who were turned of thirty, without\nbeing under the necessity of proceeding by tedious addresses, and was\nthought to have co-operated with the waters in removing the sterility of\ncertain ladies, who had long undergone the reproach and disgust of their\nhusbands; while Peregrine set up his throne among those who laboured\nunder the disease of celibacy, from the pert miss of fifteen, who,\nwith a fluttering heart, tosses her head, bridles up, and giggles\ninvoluntarily at sight of a handsome young man, to the staid maid of\ntwenty-eight, who, with a demure aspect, moralizes on the vanity of\nbeauty, the folly of youth, and simplicity of woman, and expatiates\non friendship, benevolence, and good sense, in the style of a Platonic\nphilosopher.\n\nIn such a diversity of dispositions, his conquests were attended with\nall the heart-burnings, animosities, and turmoils of jealousy and spite.\nThe younger class took all opportunities of mortifying their seniors\nin public, by treating them with that indignity which, contrary to the\ngeneral privilege of age, is, by the consent and connivance of mankind,\nleveled against those who have the misfortune to come under the\ndenomination of old maids; and these last retorted their hostilities\nin the private machinations of slander, supported by experience and\nsubtilty of invention. Not one day passed in which some new story did\nnot circulate, to the prejudice of one or other of those rivals.\n\nIf our hero, in the long-room, chanced to quit one of the moralists,\nwith whom he had been engaged in conversation, he was immediately\naccosted by a number of the opposite faction, who, with ironical smiles,\nupbraided him with cruelty to the poor lady he had left, exhorted him to\nhave compassion on her sufferings; and, turning their eyes towards\nthe object of their intercession, broke forth into a universal peal of\nlaughter. On the other hand, when Peregrine, in consequence of having\ndanced with one of the minors overnight, visited her in the morning,\nthe Platonists immediately laid hold on the occasion, tasked their\nimaginations, associated ideas, and, with sage insinuations, retailed a\nthousand circumstances of the interview, which never had any foundation\nin truth. They observed, that, if girls are determined to behave with\nsuch indiscretion, they must lay their accounts with incurring the\ncensure of the world; that she in question was old enough to act more\ncircumspectly; and wondered that her mother would permit any young\nfellow to approach the chamber while her daughter was naked in bed.\nAs for the servants peeping through the key-hole, to be sure it was an\nunlucky accident; but people ought to be upon their guard against\nsuch curiosity, and give their domestics no cause to employ their\npenetration. These and other such reflections were occasionally\nwhispered as secrets among those who were known to be communicative; so\nthat, in a few hours, it became the general topic of discourse; and,\nas it had been divulged under injunctions of secrecy, it was almost\nimpossible to trace the scandal to its origin; because every person\nconcerned must have promulgated her own breach of trust, in discovering\nher author of the report.\n\nPeregrine, instead of allaying, rather exasperated this contention,\nby an artful distribution of his attention among the competitors; well\nknowing, that, should his regard be converged into one point, he would\nsoon forfeit the pleasure he enjoyed in seeing them at variance; for\nboth parties would join against the common enemy, and his favourite\nwould be persecuted by the whole coalition. He perceived, that, among\nthe secret agents of scandal, none were so busy as the physicians, a\nclass of animals who live in this place, like so many ravens hovering\nabout a carcase, and even ply for employment, like scullers at\nHungerford-stairs. The greatest part of them have correspondents\nin London, who make it their business to inquire into the history,\ncharacter, and distemper of every one that repairs to Bath, for the\nbenefit of the waters, and if they cannot procure interest to recommend\ntheir medical friends to these patients before they set out, they at\nleast furnish them with a previous account of what they could collect,\nthat their correspondents may use this intelligence for their own\nadvantage. By these means, and the assistance of flattery and assurance,\nthey often insinuate themselves into the acquaintance of strangers, and,\nby consulting their dispositions, become necessary and subservient to\ntheir prevailing passions. By their connection with apothecaries and\nnurses, they are informed of all the private occurrences in each family,\nand therefore enabled to gratify the rancour of malice, amuse the spleen\nof peevish indisposition, and entertain the eagerness of impertinent\ncuriosity.\n\nIn the course of these occupations, which frequently affected the\nreputation of our two adventurers, this whole body fell under the\ndispleasure of our hero, who, after divers consultations with his\nfriend, concerted a stratagem, which was practised upon the faculty\nin this manner. Among those who frequented the pump-room, was an old\nofficer, whose temper, naturally impatient, was, by repeated attacks\nof the gout, which had almost deprived him of the use of his limbs,\nsublimated into a remarkable degree of virulence and perverseness. He\nimputed the inveteracy of his distemper to the malpractice of a surgeon\nwho had administered to him, while he laboured under the consequences\nof an unfortunate amour; and this supposition had inspired him with an\ninsurmountable antipathy to all the professors of the medical art, which\nwas more and more confirmed by the information of a friend at London,\nwho had told him, that it was the common practice among the physicians\nat Bath to dissuade their patients from drinking the water, that the\ncure, and in consequence their attendance, might be longer protracted.\n\nThus prepossessed, he had come to Bath, and, conformable to a few\ngeneral instructions he had received, used the waters without any\nfarther direction, taking all occasions of manifesting his hatred and\ncontempt of the sons of Esculapius, both by speech and gesticulations,\nand even by pursuing a regimen quite contrary to that which he knew they\nprescribed to others who seemed to be exactly in his condition. But he\ndid not find his account in this method, how successful soever it may\nhave been in other cases. His complaints, instead of vanishing, were\nevery day more and more enraged: and at length he was confined to his\nbed, where he lay blaspheming from morn to night, and from night to\nmorn, though still more determined than ever to adhere to his former\nmaxims.\n\nIn the midst of his torture, which was become the common joke of the\ntown, being circulated through the industry of the physicians, who\ntriumphed in his disaster, Peregrine, by means of Mr. Pipes, employed a\ncountry fellow, who had come to market, to run with great haste, early\none morning, to the lodgings of all the doctors in town, and desire them\nto attend the colonel with all imaginable despatch. In consequence of\nthis summons, the whole faculty put themselves in motion; and three\nof the foremost arriving at the same instant of time, far from\ncomplimenting one another with the door, each separately essayed to\nenter, and the whole triumvirate stuck in the passage. While they\nremained thus wedged together, they descried two of their brethren\nposting towards the same goal, with all the speed that God had enabled\nthem to exert; upon which they came to a parley, and agreed to stand\nby one another. This covenant being made, they disentangled themselves,\nand, inquiring about the patient, were told by the servant that he had\njust fallen asleep.\n\nHaving received this intelligence, they took possession of his\nante-chamber, and shut the door, while the rest of the tribe posted\nthemselves on the outside as they arrived; so that the whole passage was\nfilled, from the top of the staircase to the street-door; and the people\nof the house, together with the colonel's servant, struck dumb with\nastonishment. The three leaders of this learned gang had no sooner made\ntheir lodgment good, than they began to consult about the patient's\nmalady, which every one of them pretended to have considered with great\ncare and assiduity. The first who gave his opinion, said, the distemper\nwas an obstinate arthritis; the second affirmed, that it was no other\nthan a confirmed pox; and the third swore, it was an inveterate scurvy.\nThis diversity of opinions was supported by a variety of quotations\nfrom medical authors, ancient as well as modern; but these were not of\nsufficient authority, or, at least, not explicit enough to decide the\ndispute; for there are many schisms in medicine, as well as in religion,\nand each sect can quote the fathers in support of the tenets they\nprofess. In short, the contention rose to such a pitch of clamour, as\nnot only alarmed the brethren on the stair, but also awaked the patient\nfrom the first nap he had enjoyed in the space of ten whole days. Had\nit been simply waking, he would have been obliged to them for the noise\nthat disturbed him; for, in that case, he would have been relieved from\nthe tortures of hell fire, to which, in his dreams, he fancied himself\nexposed. But this dreadful vision had been the result of that impression\nwhich was made upon his brain by the intolerable anguish of his joints;\nso that, when he awaked, the pain, instead of being allayed, was\nrather aggravated by a great acuteness of sensation; and the confused\nvociferation in the next room invading his ears at the same time, he\nbegan to think his dream was realised, and, in the pangs of despair,\napplied himself to a bell that stood by his bedside, which he rung with\ngreat violence and perseverance.\n\nThis alarm put an immediate stop to the disputation of the three\ndoctors, who, upon this notice of his being awake, rushed into his\nchamber, without ceremony; and two of them seizing his arms, the third\nmade the like application to one of his temples. Before the patient\ncould recollect himself from the amazement which had laid hold on him\nat this unexpected irruption, the room was filled by the rest of the\nfaculty, who followed the servant that entered in obedience to his\nmaster's call; and the bed was in a moment surrounded by these gaunt\nministers of death. The colonel seeing himself beset with such an\nassemblage of solemn visages and figures, which he had always considered\nwith the utmost detestation and abhorrence, was incensed to a most\ninexpressible degree of indignation; and so inspirited by his rage, that\nthough his tongue denied its office, his other limbs performed their\nfunctions. He disengaged himself from the triumvirate, who had taken\npossession of his body, sprung out of bed with incredible agility, and,\nseizing one of his crutches, applied it so effectually to one of the\nthree, just as he stooped to examine the patient's water, that his\ntie-periwig dropped into the pot, while he himself fell motionless on\nthe floor.\n\nThis significant explanation disconcerted the whole fraternity; every\nman turned his face, as if it were by instinct, towards the door;\nand the retreat of the community being obstructed by the efforts of\nindividuals, confusion and tumultuous uproar ensued. For the colonel,\nfar from limiting his prowess to the first exploit, handled his weapon\nwith astonishing vigour and dexterity, without respect of persons; so\nthat few or none of them had escaped without marks of his displeasure,\nwhen his spirits failed, and he sank down again quite exhausted on his\nbed. Favoured by this respite, the discomfited faculty collected their\nhats and wigs, which had fallen off in the fray; and perceiving the\nassailant too much enfeebled to renew the attack, set up their throats\ntogether, and loudly threatened to prosecute him severely for such an\noutrageous assault.\n\nBy this time the landlord had interposed; and, inquiring into the\ncause of the disturbance, was informed of what had happened by the\ncomplainants, who, at the same time, giving him to understand that\nthey had been severally summoned to attend the colonel that morning, he\nassured them that they had been imposed upon by some wag, for his lodger\nhad never dreamed of consulting any one of their profession.\n\nThunderstruck at this declaration, the general clamour instantaneously\nceased; and each, in particular, at once comprehending the nature of\nthe joke, they sneaked silently off with the loss they had sustained, in\nunutterable shame and mortification; while Peregrine and his friend, who\ntook care to be passing that way by accident, made a full stop at\nsight of such an extraordinary efflux, and enjoyed the countenance and\ncondition of every one as he appeared; nay, even made up to some of\nthose who seemed most affected with their situation, and mischievously\ntormented them with questions, touching this unusual congregation; then,\nin consequence of the information they received from the landlord and\nthe colonel's valet, subjected the sufferers to the ridicule of all the\ncompany in town. As it would have been impossible for the authors of\nthis farce to keep themselves concealed from the indefatigable inquiries\nof the physicians, they made no secret of their having directed the\nwhole: though they took care to own it in such an ambiguous manner, as\nafforded no handle of prosecution.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXI.\n\n\n\nPeregrine humbles a noted Hector, and meets with a strange Character at\nthe House of a certain Lady.\n\n\nAmong those who never failed to reside at Bath during the season, was a\ncertain person, who, from the most abject misery, had, by his industry\nand art at play, amassed about fifteen thousand pounds; and though his\ncharacter was notorious, insinuated himself so far into the favour\nof what is called the best company, that very few private parties of\npleasure took place in which he was not principally concerned. He was\nof a gigantic stature, a most intrepid countenance; and his disposition,\nnaturally overbearing, had, in the course of his adventures and success,\nacquired a most intolerable degree of insolence and vanity. By the\nferocity of his features, and audacity of his behaviour, he had obtained\na reputation for the most undaunted courage, which had been confirmed by\ndivers adventures, in which he had humbled the most assuming heroes of\nhis own fraternity; so that he now reigned chief Hector of the place\nwith unquestioned authority.\n\nWith this son of fortune was Peregrine one evening engaged at play, and\nso successful, that he could not help informing his friend of his\ngood luck. Godfrey, hearing the description of the loser, immediately\nrecognized the person, whom he had known at Tunbridge; and, assuring\nPickle that he was a sharper of the first water, cautioned him against\nany further connection with such a dangerous companion, who, he\naffirmed, had suffered him to win a small sum, that he might be\nencouraged to lose a much greater sum upon some other occasion.\n\nOur young gentleman treasured up this advice; and though he did not\nscruple to give the gamester an opportunity of retrieving his loss, when\nhe next day demanded his revenge, he absolutely refused to proceed\nafter he had refunded his winning. The other, who considered him as\na hot-headed unthinking youth, endeavoured to inflame his pride to a\ncontinuance of the game, by treating his skill with scorn and contempt;\nand, among other sarcastic expressions, advised him to go to school\nagain, before he pretended to engage with masters of the art. Our hero,\nincensed at his arrogance, replied with great warmth, that he knew\nhimself sufficiently qualified for playing with men of honour, who deal\nupon the square, and hoped he should always deem it infamous either\nto learn or practise the tricks of a professed gamester. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlood and\nthunder! meaning me, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried this artist, raising his voice, and\ncurling his visage into a most intimidating frown. \u00e2\u0080\u009cZounds! I'll cut the\nthroat of any scoundrel who has the presumption to suppose that I don't\nplay as honourably as e'er a nobleman in the kingdom: and I insist upon\nan explanation from you, sir; or, by hell and brimstone! I shall expect\nother sort of satisfaction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Peregrine (whose blood by this time boiled\nwithin him) answered without hesitation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFar from thinking your demand\nunreasonable, I will immediately explain myself without reserve, and\ntell you, that, upon unquestionable authority, I believe you to be an\nimpudent rascal and common cheat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Hector was so amazed and confounded at the freedom of this\ndeclaration, which he thought no man on earth would venture to make in\nhis presence, that, for some minutes, he could not recollect himself;\nbut at length whispered a challenge in the ear of our hero, which was\naccordingly accepted. When they arrived next morning upon the field, the\ngamester, arming his countenance with all its terrors, advanced with a\nsword of a monstrous length, and, putting himself in a posture, called\nout aloud in a most terrific voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDraw, d--n ye, draw; I will this\ninstant send you to your fathers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The youth was not slow in complying\nwith his desire; his weapon was unsheathed in a moment, and he began\nthe attack with such unexpected spirit and address, that his adversary,\nhaving made shift with great difficulty to parry the first pass,\nretreated a few paces, and demanded a parley, in which he endeavoured\nto persuade the young man, that to lay a man of his character under\nthe necessity of chastising his insolence, was the most rash and\ninconsiderate step that he could possibly have taken; but that he had\ncompassion upon his youth, and was willing to spare him if he would\nsurrender his sword, and promise to ask pardon in public for the offence\nhe had given. Pickle was so much exasperated at this unparalleled\neffrontery, that, without deigning to make the least reply, he flung\nhis own hat in the proposer's face, and renewed the charge with such\nundaunted agility, that the gamester, finding himself in manifest\nhazard of his life, betook himself to his heels, and fled homewards\nwith incredible speed, being closely pursued by Peregrine, who, having\nsheathed his sword, pelted him with stones as he ran, and compelled him\nto go, that same day, into banishment from Bath, where he had domineered\nso long.\n\nBy this achievement, which was the subject of astonishment to all the\ncompany, who had looked upon the fugitive as a person of heroic\ncourage, our adventurer's reputation was rendered formidable in all\nits circumstances; although he thereby disobliged a good many people of\nfashion, who had contracted an intimacy of friendship with the exile,\nand who resented his disgrace, as if it had been the misfortune of\na worthy man. These generous patrons, however, bore a very small\nproportion to those who were pleased with the event of the duel;\nbecause, in the course of their residence at Bath, they had either been\ninsulted or defrauded by the challenger. Nor was this instance of our\nhero's courage unacceptable to the ladies, few of whom could now resist\nthe united force of such accomplishments. Indeed, neither he nor\nhis friend Godfrey would have found much difficulty in picking up an\nagreeable companion for life; but Gauntlet's heart was pre-engaged\nto Sophy; and Pickle, exclusive of his attachment to Emily, which was\nstronger than he himself imagined, possessed such a share of ambition\nas could not be satisfied with the conquest of any female he beheld at\nBath.\n\nHis visits were, therefore, promiscuous, without any other view than\nthat of amusement; and though his pride was flattered by the advances\nof the fair, whom he had captivated, he never harboured one thought of\nproceeding beyond the limits of common gallantry, and carefully avoided\nall particular explanations. But, what above all other enjoyments\nyielded him the most agreeable entertainment, was the secret history of\ncharacters, which he learned from a very extraordinary person, with whom\nhe became acquainted in this manner.\n\nBeing at the house of a certain lady on a visiting day, he was struck\nwith the appearance of an old man, who no sooner entered the room than\nthe mistress of the house very kindly desired one of the wits present to\nroast the old put. This petit-maitre, proud of the employment, went up\nto the senior, who had something extremely peculiar and significant\nin his countenance, and saluting him with divers fashionable congees,\naccosted him in these words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour servant, you old rascal. I hope to\nhave the honour of seeing you hanged. I vow to Gad! you look extremely\nshocking, with these gummy eyes, lanthorn jaws, and toothless chaps.\nWhat! you squint at the ladies, you old rotten medlar? Yes, yes, we\nunderstand your ogling; but you must content yourself with a cook-maid,\nsink me! I see you want to sit. These withered shanks of yours tremble\nunder their burden; but you must have a little patience, old Hirco!\nindeed you must. I intend to mortify you a little longer, curse me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe company was so tickled with this address, which was delivered with\nmuch grimace and gesticulation, that they burst out into a loud fit\nof laughter, which they fathered upon a monkey that was chained in the\nroom; and, when the peal was over, the wit renewed the attack in these\nwords: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose you are fool enough to think this mirth was occasioned\nby Pug. Ay, there he is; you had best survey him; he is of your own\nfamily; switch me. But the laugh was at your expense; and you ought\nto thank Heaven for making you so ridiculous.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While he uttered these\ningenious ejaculations, the old gentleman bowed alternately to him and\nthe monkey, that seemed to grin and chatter in imitation of the beau,\nand, with an arch solemnity of visage, pronounced, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGentlemen, as I have\nnot the honour to understand your compliments, they will be much better\nbestowed on each other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he seated himself, and had the\nsatisfaction to see the laugh returned upon the aggressor, who remained\nconfounded and abashed, and in a few minutes left the room, muttering,\nas he retired, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe old fellow grows scurrilous, stap my breath!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile Peregrine wondered in silence at this extraordinary scene, the\nlady of the house perceiving his surprise, gave him to understand, that\nthe ancient visitant was utterly bereft of the sense of hearing;\nthat his name was Cadwallader Crabtree, his disposition altogether\nmisanthropical; and that he was admitted into company on account\nof entertainment he afforded by his sarcastic observations, and the\npleasant mistakes to which he was subject from his infirmity. Nor did\nour hero wait a long time for an illustration of this odd character.\nEvery sentence he spoke was replete with gall; nor did his satire\nconsist in general reflections, but a series of remarks, which had been\nmade through the medium of a most whimsical peculiarity of opinion.\n\nAmong those who were present at this assembly was a young officer, who\nhaving, by dint of interest, obtained a seat in the lower house, thought\nit incumbent upon him to talk of affairs of state; and accordingly\nregaled the company with an account of a secret expedition which the\nFrench were busied in preparing; assuring them that he had it from the\nmouth of the minister, to whom it had been transmitted by one of his\nagents abroad. In descanting upon the particulars of the armament,\nhe observed that they had twenty ships of the line ready manned and\nvictualled at Brest, which were destined for Toulon, where they would\nbe joined by as many more; and from thence proceed to the execution of\ntheir scheme, which he imparted as a secret not fit to be divulged.\n\nThis piece of intelligence being communicated to all the company except\nMr. Crabtree, who suffered by his loss of hearing, that cynic was soon\nafter accosted by a lady, who, by means of an artificial alphabet,\nformed by a certain conjunction and disposition of the fingers, asked if\nhe had heard any extraordinary news of late. Cadwallader, with his usual\ncomplaisance, replied, that he supposed she took him for a courier or\nspy, by teasing him eternally with that question. He then expatiated\nupon the foolish curiosity of mankind, which, he said, must either\nproceed from idleness or want of ideas; and repeated almost verbatim\nthe officer's information, a vague ridiculous report invented by some\nignorant coxcomb, who wanted to give himself airs of importance, and\nbelieved only by those who were utterly unacquainted with the politics\nand strength of the French nation.\n\nIn confirmation of what he had advanced, he endeavoured to demonstrate\nhow impossible it must be for that people to fit out even the third part\nof such a navy, so soon after the losses they had sustained during\nthe war; and confirmed his proof by asserting, that to his certain\nknowledge, the harbours of Brest and Toulon could not at that time\nproduce a squadron of eight ships of the line. The member, who was\nan utter stranger to this misanthrope, hearing his own asseverations\ntreated with such contempt, glowed with confusion and resentment,\nand, raising his voice, began to defend his own veracity, with great\neagerness and trepidation, mingling with his arguments many blustering\ninvectives, against the insolence and ill manners of his supposed\ncontradictor, who sat with the most mortifying composure of countenance,\ntill the officer's patience was quite exhausted, and then, to the\nmanifest increase of his vexation, he was informed, that his antagonist\nwas so deaf, that in all probability, the last trumpet would make no\nimpression upon him, without a previous renovation of his organs.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXII.\n\n\n\nHe cultivates an Acquaintance with the Misanthrope, who favours him with\na short Sketch of his own History.\n\n\nPeregrine was extremely well pleased with this occasional rebuke, which\noccurred so seasonably, that he could scarce believe it accidental. He\nlooked upon Cadwallader as the greatest curiosity he had ever known,\nand cultivated the old man's acquaintance with such insinuating address,\nthat in less than a fortnight he obtained his confidence. As they one\nday walked into the fields together, the man-hater disclosed himself in\nthese words:--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThough the term of our communication has been but short,\nyou must have perceived, that I treat you with uncommon marks of regard;\nwhich, I assure you, is not owing to your personal accomplishments, nor\nthe pains you take to oblige me; for the first I overlook, and the\nlast I see through. But there is something in your disposition which\nindicates a rooted contempt for the world, and I understand you have\nmade some successful efforts in exposing one part of it to the ridicule\nof the other. It is upon this assurance that I offer you my advice and\nassistance, in prosecuting other schemes of the same nature; and to\nconvince you that such an alliance is not to be rejected, I will now\ngive you a short sketch of my history, which will be published after my\ndeath, in forty-seven volumes of my own compiling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was born about forty miles from this place, of parents who, having\na very old family name to support, bestowed their whole fortune on my\nelder brother; so that I inherited of my father little else than a large\nshare of choler, to which I am indebted for a great many adventures that\ndid not always end to my satisfaction. At the age of eighteen I was sent\nup to town, with a recommendation to a certain peer, who found means\nto amuse me with the promise of a commission for seven whole years; and\n'tis odds but I should have made my fortune by my perseverance, had not\nI been arrested, and thrown into the Marshalsea by my landlord, on whose\ncredit I had subsisted three years, after my father had renounced me as\nan idle vagabond. There I remained six months, among those prisoners\nwho have no other support than chance charity; and contracted a very\nvaluable acquaintance, which was of great service to me in the future\nemergencies of my life.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was no sooner discharged, in consequence of an act of parliament\nfor the relief of insolvent debtors, than I went to the house of my\ncreditor, whom I cudgelled without mercy; and, that I might leave\nnothing undone of those things which I ought to have done, my next stage\nwas to Westminster Hall, where I waited until my patron came forth from\nthe house, and saluted him with a blow that laid him senseless on the\npavement. But my retreat was not so fortunate as I could have wished.\nThe chairman and lacqueys in waiting having surrounded and disarmed me\nin a trice, I was committed to Newgate, and loaded with chains; and\na very sagacious gentleman, who was afterwards hanged, having sat in\njudgment upon my case, pronounced me guilty of a capital crime, and\nforetold my condemnation at the Old Bailey. His prognostic, however, was\ndisappointed; for nobody appearing to prosecute me at the next session,\nI was discharged by order of the court. It would be impossible for me\nto recount, in the compass of one day's conversation, all the particular\nexploits of which I bore considerable share. Suffice it to say, I have\nbeen, at different times, prisoner in all the jails within the bills of\nmortality. I have broken from every round-house on this side Temple-bar.\nNo bailiff, in the days of my youth and desperation, durst execute a\nwrit upon me without a dozen of followers; and the justices themselves\ntrembled when I was brought before them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was once maimed by a carman, with whom I quarrelled, because he\nridiculed my leek on St. David's day; my skull was fractured by a\nbutcher's cleaver on the like occasion. I have been run through the body\nfive times, and lost the tip of my left ear by a pistol bullet. In a\nrencontre of this kind, having left my antagonist for dead, I was wise\nenough to make my retreat into France; and a few days after my arrival\nat Paris, entering into conversation with some officers on the subject\nof politics, a dispute arose, in which I lost my temper, and spoke so\nirreverently of the Grand Monarque, that next morning I was sent to the\nBastille, by virtue of a lettre de cachet. There I remained for\nsome months, deprived of all intercourse with rational creatures;\na circumstance for which I was not sorry, as I had the more time to\nproject schemes of revenge against the tyrant who confined me, and the\nwretch who had betrayed my private conversation. But tired, at length,\nwith these fruitless suggestions, I was fain to unbend the severity of\nmy thoughts by a correspondence with some industrious spiders, who had\nhung my dungeon with their ingenious labours.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI considered their work with such attention that I soon became an adept\nin the mystery of weaving, and furnished myself with as many useful\nobservations and reflections on that art, as will compose a very curious\ntreatise, which I intend to bequeath to the Royal Society, for the\nbenefit of our woollen manufacture; and this with a view to perpetuate\nmy own name, rather than befriend my country; for, thank Heaven! I am\nweaned from all attachments of that kind, and look upon myself as one\nvery little obliged to any society whatsoever. Although I presided\nwith absolute power over this long-legged community, and distributed\npunishments and rewards to each, according to his deserts, I grew\nimpatient of my situation; and my natural disposition one day\nprevailing, like a fire which had long been smothered, I wreaked the\nfury of my indignation upon my innocent subjects, and in a twinkling\ndestroyed the whole race. While I was employed in this general massacre,\nthe turnkey, who brought me food, opened the door, and perceiving my\ntransport, shrugged up his shoulders, and leaving my allowance, went\nout, pronouncing, Le pauvre diable! la tete lui tourne. My passion no\nsooner subsided than I resolved to profit by this opinion of the jailor,\nand from that day counterfeited lunacy with such success, that in less\nthan three months I was delivered from the Bastille, and sent to the\ngalleys, in which they thought my bodily vigour might be of service,\nalthough the faculties of my mind were decayed. Before I was chained\nto the oar, I received three hundred stripes by way of welcome, that I\nmight thereby be rendered more tractable, notwithstanding I used all the\narguments in my power to persuade them I was only mad north-north-west,\nand, when the wind was southerly, knew a hawk from a handsaw.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn our second cruise we had the good fortune to be overtaken by\na tempest, during which the slaves were unbound, that they might\ncontribute the more to the preservation of the galley, and have a chance\nfor their lives, in case of shipwreck. We were no sooner at liberty,\nthan, making ourselves masters of the vessel, we robbed the officers,\nand ran her on shore among rocks on the coast of Portugal; from whence\nI hastened to Lisbon, with a view of obtaining my passage in some ship\nbound for England, where, by this time, I hoped my affair was forgotten.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, before this scheme could be accomplished, my evil genius led me\ninto company; and, being intoxicated, I began to broach doctrines on\nthe subject of religion, at which some of the party were scandalized and\nincensed; and I was next day dragged out of bed by the officers of the\nInquisition, and conveyed to a cell in the prison belonging to that\ntribunal.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt my first examination, my resentment was strong enough to support me\nunder the torture, which I endured without flinching; but my resolution\nabated, and my zeal immediately cooled, when I understood from a\nfellow-prisoner, who groaned on the other side of the partition, that\nin a short time there would be an auto da fe; in consequence of which\nI should, in all probability, be doomed to the flames, if I would not\nrenounce my heretical errors, and submit to such penance as the church\nshould think fit to prescribe. This miserable wretch was convicted of\nJudaism, which he had privately practised by connivance for many years,\nuntil he had amassed a fortune sufficient to attract the regard of the\nchurch. To this he fell a sacrifice, and accordingly prepared himself\nfor the stake; while I, not at all ambitious of the crown of martyrdom,\nresolved to temporize; so that, when I was brought to the question the\nsecond time, I made a solemn recantation. As I had no worldly fortune to\nobstruct my salvation, I was received into the bosom of the church, and,\nby way of penance, enjoined to walk barefoot to Rome in the habit of a\npilgrim.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDuring my peregrination through Spain, I was detained as a spy, until\nI could procure credentials from the Inquisition at Lisbon; and behaved\nwith such resolution and reserve, that, after being released, I\nwas deemed a proper person to be employed in quality of a secret\nintelligencer at a certain court. This office I undertook without\nhesitation; and being furnished with money and bills of credit, crossed\nthe Pyrenees, with intention to revenge myself upon the Spaniards for\nthe severities I had undergone during my captivity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving therefore effectually disguised myself by a change of dress, and\na large patch on one eye, I hired an equipage, and appeared at Bologna\nin quality of an itinerant physician; in which capacity I succeeded\ntolerably well, till my servants decamped in the night with my baggage,\nand left me in the condition of Adam. In short, I have travelled over\nthe greatest part of Europe, as a beggar, pilgrim, priest, soldier,\ngamester, and quack; and felt the extremes of indigence and opulence,\nwith the inclemency of weather in all its vicissitudes. I have learned\nthat the characters of mankind are everywhere the same; that common\nsense and honesty bear an infinitely small proportion to folly and vice;\nand that life is at best a paltry province.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter having suffered innumerable hardships, dangers, and disgraces, I\nreturned to London, where I lived some years in a garret, and picked up\na subsistence, such as it was, by vending purges in the streets, from\nthe back of a pied horse, in which situation I used to harangue the mob\nin broken English, under pretence of being an High German doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt last an uncle died, by whom I inherited an estate of three hundred\npounds per annum, though, in his lifetime, he would not have parted with\na sixpence to save my soul and body from perdition.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI now appear in the world, not as a member of any community, or what\nis called a social creature, but merely as a spectator, who entertains\nhimself with the grimaces of a jack-pudding, and banquets his spleen in\nbeholding his enemies at loggerheads. That I may enjoy this disposition,\nabstracted from all interruption, danger, and participation, I feign\nmyself deaf; an expedient by which I not only avoid all disputes and\ntheir consequences, but also become master of a thousand little secrets,\nwhich are every day whispered in my presence, without any suspicion of\ntheir being overheard. You saw how I handled that shallow politician at\nmy Lady Plausible's the other day. The same method I practise upon the\ncrazed Tory, the bigot Whig, the sour, supercilious pedant, the petulant\ncritic, the blustering coward, the fawning fool, the pert imp, sly\nsharper, and every other species of knaves and fools, with which this\nkingdom abounds.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn consequence of my rank and character, I obtain free admission to\nthe ladies, among whom I have acquired the appellation of the Scandalous\nChronicle. As I am considered, while silent, in no other light than that\nof a footstool or elbow-chair, they divest their conversation of all\nrestraint before me, and gratify my sense of hearing with strange\nthings, which, if I could prevail upon myself to give the world that\nsatisfaction, would compose a curious piece of secret history, and\nexhibit a quite different idea of characters from what is commonly\nentertained.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy this time, young gentleman, you may perceive that I have it in\nmy power to be a valuable correspondent, and that it will be to your\ninterest to deserve my confidence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere the misanthrope left off speaking, desirous to know the sentiments\nof our hero, who embraced the proffered alliance in a transport of joy\nand surprise; and the treaty was no sooner concluded, than Mr. Crabtree\nbegan to perform articles, by imparting to him a thousand delicious\nsecrets, from the possession of which he promised himself innumerable\nscenes of mirth and enjoyment. By means of this associate, whom he\nconsidered as the ring of Gyges, he foresaw, that he should be enabled\nto penetrate, not only into the chambers, but even to the inmost\nthoughts of the female sex. In order to ward off suspicion, they\nagreed to revile each other in public, and meet at a certain private\nrendezvous, to communicate their mutual discoveries, and concert their\nfuture operations.\n\nBut, soon after this agreement, our adventurer was summoned to the\ngarrison by an express from his friend Hatchway, representing that the\ncommodore lay at the point of death; and, in less than an hour after\nthe receipt of this melancholy piece of news, he set out post for his\nuncle's habitation, having previously taken leave of Crabtree,\nwho promised to meet him in two months in London; and settled a\ncorrespondence with Gauntlet, who proposed to remain at Bath during the\nrest of the season.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\n\n\n\nPeregrine arrives at the Garrison, where he receives the last\nAdmonitions of Commodore Trunnion, who next Day resigns his Breath, and\nis buried according to his own Directions--Some Gentlemen in the Country\nmake a fruitless Attempt to accommodate Matters betwixt Mr. Gamaliel\nPickle and his eldest Son.\n\n\nAbout four o'clock in the morning our hero arrived at the garrison,\nwhere he found his generous uncle in extremity, supported in bed by\nJulia on one side, and Lieutenant Hatchway on the other, while Mr.\nJolter administered spiritual consolation to his soul; and between\nwhiles comforted Mrs. Trunnion, who, with her maid, sat by the fire,\nweeping with great decorum; the physician having just taken his last\nfee, and retired, after pronouncing the fatal prognostic, in which he\nanxiously wished he might be mistaken.\n\nThough the commodore's speech was interrupted by a violent hiccup, he\nstill retained the use of his senses; and, when Peregrine approached,\nstretched out his hand with manifest signs of satisfaction. The young\ngentleman, whose heart overflowed with gratitude and affection, could\nnot behold such a spectacle unmoved. He endeavoured to conceal his\ntenderness, which, in the wildness of his youth, and the pride of his\ndisposition, he considered as a derogation from his manhood; but, in\nspite of all his endeavours, the tears gushed from his eyes, while he\nkissed the old man's hand; and he was so utterly disconcerted by his\ngrief, that, when he attempted to speak, his tongue denied its office;\nso that the commodore, perceiving his disorder, made a last effort of\nstrength, and consoled him in these words:--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSwab the spray from your\nbowsprit, my good lad, and coil up your spirits. You must not let the\ntoplifts of your heart give way, because you see me ready to go down at\nthese years. Many a better man has foundered before he has made half\nmy way; thof I trust, by the mercy of God, I shall be sure in port in a\nvery few glasses, and fast moored in a most blessed riding; for my\ngood friend Jolter hath overhauled the journal of my sins, and, by\nthe observation he hath taken of the state of my soul, I hope I shall\nhappily conclude my voyage, and be brought up in the latitude of heaven.\nHere has been a doctor that wanted to stow me chock full of physic; but,\nwhen a man's hour is come, what signifies his taking his departure with\na 'pothecary's shop in his hold? Those fellows come alongside of dying\nmen, like the messengers of the Admiralty with sailing orders; but\nI told him as how I could slip my cable without his direction or\nassistance, and so he hauled off in dudgeon. This cursed hiccup makes\nsuch a rippling in the current of my speech, that mayhap you don't\nunderstand what I say. Now, while the sucker of my wind-pump will go, I\nwould willingly mention a few things, which I hope you will set down\nin the log-book of your remembrance, when I am stiff, d'ye see. There's\nyour aunt sitting whimpering by the fire; I desire you will keep her\ntight, warm, and easy in her old age, she's an honest heart in her own\nway, and, thof she goes a little crank and humoursome, by being often\noverstowed with Nantz and religion, she has been a faithful shipmate to\nme, and I daresay she never turned in with another man since we first\nembarked in the same bottom. Jack Hatchway, you know the trim of her as\nwell as e'er a man in England, and I believe she has a kindness for\nyou; whereby, if you two will grapple in the way of matrimony, when I\nam gone, I do suppose that my godson, for love of me, will allow you to\nlive in the garrison all the days of your life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPeregrine assured him, he would with pleasure comply with any request\nhe should make in behalf of two persons whom he esteemed so much.\nThe lieutenant, with a waggish sneer, which even the gravity of the\nsituation could not prevent, thanked them both for their good-will,\ntelling the commodore, he was obliged to him for his friendship, in\nseeking to promote him to the command of a vessel which he himself had\nworn out in the service; but that, notwithstanding, he should be content\nto take charge of her, though he could not help being shy of coming\nafter such an able navigator.\n\nTrunnion, exhausted as he was, smiled at this sally, and, after some\npause, resumed his admonitions in this manner:--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI need not talk of\nPipes, because I know you'll do for him without any recommendation; the\nfellow has sailed with me in many a hard gale, and I'll warrant him as\nstout a seaman as ever set face to the weather. But I hope you'll take\ncare of the rest of my crew, and not disrate them after I am dead,\nin favour of new followers. As for that young woman, Ned Gauntlet's\ndaughter, I'm informed as how she's an excellent wench, and has a\nrespect for you; whereby, if you run her on board in an unlawful way, I\nleave my curse upon you, and trust you will never prosper in the voyage\nof life. But I believe you are more of an honest man, than to behave\nso much like a pirate. I beg, of all love, you wool take care of your\nconstitution, and beware of running foul of harlots, who are no better\nthan so many mermaids, that sit upon rocks in the sea, and hang out a\nfair face for the destruction of passengers; thof I must say, for my own\npart, I never met with any of those sweet singers, and yet I have gone\nto sea for the space of thirty years. But howsomever, steer your course\nclear of all such brimstone b--s. Shun going to law, as you would shun\nthe devil; and look upon all attorneys as devouring sharks, or ravenous\nfish of prey. As soon as the breath is out of my body, let minute guns\nbe fired, till I am safe under ground. I would also be buried in the\nred jacket I had on when I boarded and took the Renummy. Let my pistols,\ncutlass, and pocket-compass be laid in the coffin along with me. Let\nme be carried to the grave by my own men, rigged in the black caps and\nwhite shirts which my barge's crew were wont to wear; and they must keep\na good look out, that none of your pilfering rascallions may come and\nheave me up again, for the lucre of what they can get, until the carcase\nis belayed by a tombstone. As for the motto, or what you call it, I\nleave that to you and Mr. Jolter, who are scholars; but I do desire,\nthat it may not be engraved in the Greek or Latin lingos, and much less\nin the French, which I abominate, but in plain English, that, when the\nangel comes to pipe all hands, at the great day, he may know that I am a\nBritish man, and speak to me in my mother tongue. And now I have no more\nto say, but God in heaven have mercy upon my soul, and send you all fair\nweather, wheresoever you are bound.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he regarded every individual around him with a look of\ncomplacency, and closing his eye, composed himself to rest, while the\nwhole audience, Pipes himself not excepted, were melted with sorrow; and\nMrs. Trunnion consented to quit the room, that she might not be exposed\nto the unspeakable anguish of seeing him expire.\n\nHis last moments, however, were not so near as they imagined. He began\nto doze, and enjoyed small intervals of ease, till next day in the\nafternoon; during which remissions, he was heard to pour forth many\npious ejaculations, expressing his hope, that, for all the heavy cargo\nof his sins, he should be able to surmount the puttock-shrouds of\ndespair, and get aloft to the cross-trees of God's good favour. At last\nhis voice sunk so low as not to be distinguished; and, having lain about\nan hour, almost without any perceptible signs of life, he gave up the\nghost with a groan which announced his decease.\n\nJulia was no sooner certified of this melancholy event, than she ran to\nher aunt's chamber, weeping aloud; and immediately a very decent concert\nwas performed by the good widow and her attendants. Peregrine and\nHatchway retired till the corpse should be laid out; and Pipes having\nsurveyed the body, with a face of rueful attention,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell fare thy\nsoul! old Hawser Trunnion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he: \u00e2\u0080\u009cman and boy I have known thee\nthese five-and-thirty years, and sure a truer heart never broke biscuit.\nMany a hard gale hast thou weathered; but now thy spells are all over,\nand thy hull fairly laid up. A better commander I'd never desire to\nserve; and who knows but I may help to set up thy standing rigging in\nanother world?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAll the servants of the house were affected with the loss of their old\nmaster; and the poor people in the neighbourhood assembled at the gate,\nand, by repeated howlings, expressed their sorrow for the death of their\ncharitable benefactor. Peregrine, though he felt everything which\nlove and gratitude could inspire on this occasion, was not so much\noverwhelmed with affliction as to be incapable of taking the management\nof the family into his own hands. He gave directions about the funeral\nwith great discretion, after having paid the compliments of condolence\nto his aunt, whom he consoled with the assurance of his inviolable\nesteem and affection. He ordered a suit of mourning to be made for every\nperson in the garrison, and invited all the neighbouring gentlemen to\nthe burial, not even excepting his father and brother Gam, who did not,\nhowever, honour the ceremony with their presence; nor was his mother\nhumane enough to visit her sister-in-law in her distress.\n\nIn the method of interment, the commodore's injunctions were obeyed to a\ntitle; and at the same time our hero made a donation of fifty pounds to\nthe poor of the parish, as a benefaction which his uncle had forgot\nto bequeath. Having performed these obsequies with the most pious\npunctuality, he examined the will, to which there was no addition since\nit had first been executed, adjusted the payment of all the legacies,\nand, being sole executor, took an account of the estate to which he\nhad succeeded, which, after all deductions, amounted to thirty thousand\npounds. The possession of such a fortune, of which he was absolute\nmaster, did not at all contribute to the humiliation of his spirit, but\ninspired him with new ideas of grandeur and magnificence, and elevated\nhis hope to the highest pinnacle of expectation.\n\nHis domestic affairs being settled, he was visited by almost all\nthe gentlemen of the county, who came to pay their compliments of\ncongratulation on his accession to the estate; and some of them offered\ntheir good offices towards a reconciliation betwixt his father and him,\ninduced by the general detestation which was entertained for his brother\nGam, who was by this time looked upon by his neighbours as a prodigy\nof insolence and malice. Our young squire thanked them for their kind\nproposal, which he accepted; and old Gamaliel, at their entreaties,\nseemed very well disposed to any accommodation: but as he would not\nventure to declare himself before he had consulted his wife, his\nfavourable disposition was rendered altogether ineffectual, by the\ninstigations of that implacable woman; and our hero resigned all\nexpectation of being reunited to his father's house. His brother,\nas usual, took all opportunities of injuring his character, by false\naspersions, and stories misrepresented, in order to prejudice his\nreputation; nor was his sister Julia suffered to enjoy her good fortune\nin peace. Had he undergone such persecution from an alien to his blood,\nthe world would have heard of his revenge; but, notwithstanding\nhis indignation, he was too much tinctured by the prejudices of\nconsanguinity, to lift his arm in judgment against the son of his own\nparents; and this consideration abridged the term of his residence at\nthe garrison, where he had proposed to stay for some months.\n\n\n\nVOLUME II.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\n\n\n\nThe young Gentleman, having settled his domestic Affairs, arrives\nin London, and sets up a gay Equipage--He meets with Emilia, and is\nintroduced to her Uncle.\n\n\nHis aunt, at the earnest solicitations of Julia and her husband, took\nup her quarters at the house of that affectionate kinswoman, who made\nit her chief study to comfort and cherish the disconsolate widow; and\nJolter, in expectation of the living, which was not yet vacant, remained\nin garrison, in quality of land-steward upon our hero's country estate.\nAs for the lieutenant, our young gentleman communed with him in a\nserious manner about the commodore's proposal of taking Mrs. Trunnion\nto wife; and Jack, being quite tired of the solitary situation of a\nbachelor, which nothing but the company of his old commander could have\nenabled him to support so long, far from discovering aversion from the\nmatch, observed with an arch smile, that it was not the first time\nhe had commanded a vessel in the absence of Captain Trunnion; and\ntherefore, if the widow was willing, he would cheerfully stand by her\nhelm, and, as he hoped the duty would not be of long continuance, do his\nendeavour to steer her safe into port, where the commodore might come on\nboard, and take charge of her again.\n\nIn consequence of this declaration, it was determined that Mr. Hatchway\nshould make his addresses to Mrs. Trunnion as soon as decency would\npermit her to receive them; and Mr. Clover and his wife promised to\nexert their influence on his behalf. Meanwhile, Jack was desired to live\nat the castle as usual, and assured, that it should be put wholly in his\npossession, as soon as he should be able to accomplish this matrimonial\nscheme.\n\nWhen Peregrine had settled all these points to his own satisfaction,\nhe took leave of all his friends, and, repairing to the great city,\npurchased a new chariot and horses, put Pipes and another lacquey into\nrich liveries, took elegant lodgings in Pall Mall, and made a most\nremarkable appearance among the people of fashion.\n\nIt was owing to this equipage, and the gaiety of his personal\ndeportment, that common fame, which is always a common liar, represented\nhim as a young gentleman who had just succeeded to an estate of five\nthousand pounds per annum, by the death of an uncle; that he was\nentitled to an equal fortune at the decease of his own father, exclusive\nof two considerable jointures, which would devolve upon him at the\ndemise of his mother and aunt. This report, false and ridiculous as it\nwas, he could not find in his heart to contradict. Not but that he was\nsorry to find himself so misrepresented; but his vanity would not allow\nhim to take any step that might diminish his importance in the opinion\nof those who courted his acquaintance, on the supposition that his\ncircumstances were actually as affluent as they were said to be. Nay, so\nmuch was he infatuated by this weakness, that he resolved to encourage\nthe deception, by living up to the report; and accordingly engaged\nin the most expensive parties of pleasure, believing that, before his\npresent finances should be exhausted, his fortune would be effectually\nmade, by the personal accomplishments he should have occasion to display\nto the beau monde in the course of his extravagance. In a word, vanity\nand pride were the ruling foibles of our adventurer, who imagined\nhimself sufficiently qualified to retrieve his fortune in various\nshapes, long before he could have any idea of want or difficulty. He\nthought he should have it in his power, at any time, to make a prize of\na rich heiress, or opulent widow; his ambition had already aspired to\nthe heart of a young handsome duchess dowager, to whose acquaintance\nhe had found means to be introduced; or, should matrimony chance to be\nunsuitable to his inclinations, he never doubted, that, by the interest\nhe might acquire among the nobility, he should be favoured with some\nlucrative post, that would amply recompense him for the liberality\nof his disposition. There are many young men who entertain the same\nexpectations, with half the reason he had to be so presumptuous.\n\nIn the midst of these chimerical calculations, his passion for Emilia\ndid not subside; but, on the contrary, began to rage with such an\ninflammation of desire, that her idea interfered with every other\nreflection, and absolutely disabled him from prosecuting the other lofty\nschemes which his imagination had projected. He therefore laid down the\nhonest resolution of visiting her in all the splendour of his situation,\nin order to practise upon her virtue with all his art and address, to\nthe utmost extent of his affluence and fortune. Nay, so effectually\nhad his guilty passion absorbed his principles of honour, conscience,\nhumanity, and regard for the commodore's last words, that he was base\nenough to rejoice at the absence of his friend Godfrey, who, being then\nwith his regiment in Ireland, could not dive into his purpose, or take\nmeasures for frustrating his vicious design.\n\nFraught with these heroic sentiments, he determined to set out for\nSussex in his chariot and six, attended by his valet-de-chambre and\ntwo footmen; and as he was now sensible that in his last essay he had\nmistaken his cue, he determined to change his battery, and sap the\nfortress, by the most submissive, soft, and insinuating behaviour.\n\nOn the evening that preceded this proposed expedition, he went into one\nof the boxes at the playhouse, as usual, to show himself to the ladies;\nand reconnoitring the company through a glass (for no other reason but\nbecause it was fashionable to be purblind), perceived his mistress very\nplainly dressed, in one of the seats above the stage, talking to another\nyoung woman of a very homely appearance. Though his heart beat the\nalarm with the utmost impatience at sight of his Emilia, he was for some\nminutes deterred from obeying the impulse of his love, by the presence\nof some ladies of fashion, who, he feared, would think the worse of him,\nshould they see him make his compliment in public to a person of her\nfigure. Nor would the violence of his inclination have so far prevailed\nover his pride, as to lead him thither, had he not recollected, that his\nquality friends would look upon her as some handsome Abigail, with whom\nhe had an affair of gallantry, and of consequence give him credit for\nthe intrigue.\n\nEncouraged by this suggestion, he complied with the dictates of love,\nand flew to the place where his charmer sat. His air and dress were so\nremarkable, that it was almost impossible he should have escaped the\neyes of a curious observer, especially as he had chosen a time for\ncoming in, when his entrance could not fail to attract the notice of the\nspectators; I mean, when the whole house was hushed in attention to the\nperformance on the stage. Emilia, therefore, perceived him at his first\napproach; she found herself discovered by the direction of his glass,\nand, guessing his intention by his abrupt retreat from the box, summoned\nall her fortitude to her aid, and prepared for his reception. He\nadvanced to her with an air of eagerness and joy, tempered with modesty\nand respect, and expressed his satisfaction at seeing her, with a\nseeming reverence of regard. Though she was extremely well pleased at\nthis unexpected behaviour, she suppressed the emotions of her heart, and\nanswered his compliments with affected ease and unconcern, such as\nmight denote the good humour of a person who meets by accident with an\nindifferent acquaintance. After having certified himself of her own good\nhealth, he very kindly inquired about her mother and Miss Sophy, gave\nher to understand that he had lately been favoured with a letter from\nGodfrey; that he had actually intended to set out next morning on a\nvisit to Mrs. Gauntlet, which, now that he was so happy as to meet with\nher, he would postpone, until he should have the pleasure of attending\nher to the country. After having thanked him for his polite intention,\nshe told him, that her mother was expected in town in a few days, and\nthat she herself had come to London some weeks ago, to give attendance\nupon her aunt, who had been dangerously ill, but was now pretty well\nrecovered.\n\nAlthough the conversation of course turned upon general topics, during\nthe entertainment he took all opportunities of being particular with his\neyes, through which he conveyed a thousand tender protestations. She\nsaw and inwardly rejoiced at the humility of his looks; but, far from\nrewarding it with one approving glance, she industriously avoided this\nocular intercourse, and rather coquetted with a young gentleman that\nogled her from the opposite box. Peregrine's penetration easily detected\nher sentiments, and he was nettled at her dissimulation, which served to\nconfirm him in his unwarrantable designs upon her person. He persisted\nin his assiduities with indefatigable perseverance; when the play was\nconcluded, handed her and her companion into a hackney-coach, and with\ndifficulty was permitted to escort them to the house of Emilia's uncle,\nto whom our hero was introduced by the young lady, as an intimate friend\nof her brother Godfrey.\n\nThe old gentleman, who was no stranger to the nature of Peregrine's\nconnection with his sister's family, prevailed upon him to stay\nsupper, and seemed particularly well pleased with his conversation and\ndeportment, which, by the help of his natural sagacity, he wonderfully\nadapted to the humour of his entertainer. After supper, when the ladies\nwere withdrawn, and the citizen called for his pipe, our sly adventurer\nfollowed his example. Though he abhorred the plant, he smoked with\nan air of infinite satisfaction, and expatiated upon the virtues of\ntobacco, as if he had been deeply concerned in the Virginia trade. In\nthe progress of the discourse, he consulted the merchant's disposition;\nand the national debt coming upon the carpet, held forth upon the\nfunds like a professed broker. When the alderman complained of the\nrestrictions and discouragements of trade, his guest inveighed against\nexorbitant duties, with the nature of which he seemed as well acquainted\nas any commissioner of the customs; so that the uncle was astonished at\nthe extent of his knowledge, and expressed his surprise that a gay young\ngentleman like him should have found either leisure or inclination to\nconsider subjects so foreign to the fashionable amusements of youth.\n\nPickle laid hold on this opportunity to tell him, that he was descended\nfrom a race of merchants; and that, early in life, he had made it his\nbusiness to instruct himself in the different branches of trade, which\nhe not only studied as his family profession, but also as the source\nof all our national riches and power. He then launched out in praise of\ncommerce, and the promoters thereof; and, by way of contrast, employed\nall his ridicule in drawing such ludicrous pictures of the manners and\neducation of what is called high life, that the trader's sides were\nshaken by laughter, even to the danger of his life; and he looked upon\nour adventurer as a miracle of sobriety and good sense. Having thus\ningratiated himself with the uncle, Peregrine took his leave, and next\nday, in the forenoon, visited the niece in his chariot, after she\nhad been admonished by her kinsman to behave with circumspection, and\ncautioned against neglecting or discouraging the addresses of such a\nvaluable admirer.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXV.\n\n\n\nHe prosecutes his Design upon Emilia with great Art and Perseverance.\n\n\nOur adventurer, having by his hypocrisy obtained free access to his\nmistress, began the siege by professing the most sincere contrition\nfor his former levity, and imploring her forgiveness with such earnest\nsupplication, that, guarded as she was against his flattering arts, she\nbegan to believe his protestations, which were even accompanied with\ntears, and abated a good deal of that severity and distance she had\nproposed to maintain during this interview. She would not, however,\nfavour him with the least acknowledgment of a mutual passion, because,\nin the midst of his vows of eternal constancy and truth, he did not\nmention one syllable of wedlock, though he was now entirely master of\nhis own conduct, and this consideration created a doubt, which fortified\nher against all his attacks. Yet, what her discretion would have\nconcealed, was discovered by her eyes, which, in spite of all her\nendeavours, breathed forth complacency and love; for her inclination\nwas flattered by her own self-sufficiency, which imputed her admirer's\nsilence in that particular to the hurry and perturbation of his spirits,\nand persuaded her that he could not possibly regard her with any other\nthan honourable intentions.\n\nThe insidious lover exulted in the tenderness of her looks, from which\nhe presaged a complete victory; but, that he might not overshoot\nhimself by his own precipitation, he would not run the risk of declaring\nhimself, until her heart should be so far entangled within his snares,\nas that neither the suggestions of honour, prudence, nor pride, should\nbe able to disengage it. Armed with this resolution, he restrained\nthe impatience of his temper within the limits of the most delicate\ndeportment. After having solicited and obtained permission to attend\nher to the next opera, he took her by the hand, and, pressing it to his\nlips, in the most respectful manner, went away, leaving her in a most\nwhimsical state of suspense, chequered with an interesting vicissitude\nof hope and fear. On the appointed day, he appeared again about five\no'clock in the afternoon, and found her native charms so much improved\nby the advantages of dress, that he was transported with admiration\nand delight; and, while he conducted her to the Haymarket, could scarce\nbridle the impetuosity of his passion, so as to observe the forbearing\nmaxims he had adopted. When she entered the pit, he had abundance of\nfood for the gratification of his vanity; for, in a moment, she eclipsed\nall the female part of the audience; each individual allowing in her own\nheart that the stranger was by far the handsomest woman there present,\nexcept herself.\n\nHere it was that our hero enjoyed a double triumph; he was vain of this\nopportunity to enhance his reputation for gallantry among the ladies of\nfashion who knew him, and proud of an occasion to display his quality\nacquaintance to Emilia, that she might entertain the greater idea of the\nconquest she had made, and pay the more deference to his importance in\nthe sequel of his addresses. That he might profit as much as possible\nby this situation, he went up and accosted every person in the pit,\nwith whom he ever had least communication, whispered and laughed with an\naffected air of familiarity, and even bowed at a distance to some of the\nnobility, on the slender foundation of having stood near them at court,\nor presented them with a pinch of rappee at White's chocolate-house.\n\nThis ridiculous ostentation, though now practised with a view of\npromoting his design, was a weakness that, in some degree, infected\nthe whole of his behaviour; for nothing gave him so much joy in\nconversation, as an opportunity of giving the company to understand how\nwell he was with persons of distinguished rank and character. He would\noften, for example, observe, as it were occasionally, that the Duke of\nG-- was one of the best-natured men in the world, and illustrate this\nassertion by some instance of his affability, in which he himself was\nconcerned. Then, by an abrupt transition, he would repeat some repartee\nof Lady T--, and mention a certain bon mot of the Earl of C--, which was\nuttered in his hearing.\n\nAbundance of young men in this manner make free with the names, though\nthey have never had access to the persons of the nobility; but this was\nnot the case with Peregrine, who, in consideration of his appearance and\nsupposed fortune, together with the advantage of his introduction, was,\nby this time, freely admitted to the tables of the great.\n\nIn his return with Emilia from the opera, though he still maintained\nthe most scrupulous decorum in his behaviour, he plied her with the most\npassionate expressions of love, squeezed her hand with great fervency,\nprotested that his whole soul was engrossed by her idea, and that he\ncould not exist independent of her favour. Pleased as she was with his\nwarm and pathetic addresses, together with the respectful manner of his\nmaking love, she yet had prudence and resolution sufficient to contain\nher tenderness, which was ready to run over; being fortified against\nhis arts, by reflecting, that, if his aim was honourable, it was now his\nbusiness to declare it. On this consideration, she refused to make any\nserious reply to his earnest expostulations, but affected to receive\nthem as the undetermined effusions of gallantry and good breeding.\n\nThis fictitious gaiety and good-humour, though it baffled his hope\nof extorting from her an acknowledgment of which he might have taken\nimmediate advantage, nevertheless encouraged him to observe, as the\nchariot passed along the Strand, that the night was far advanced; that\nsupper would certainly be over before they could reach her uncle's\nhouse; and to propose that he should wait upon her to some place, where\nthey might be accommodated with a slight refreshment. She was offended\nat the freedom of this proposal, which, however, she treated as a joke,\nthanking him for his courteous offer, and assuring him, that when she\nshould be disposed for a tavern treat, he alone would have the honour of\nbestowing it.\n\nHer kinsman being engaged with company abroad, and her aunt retired to\nrest, he had the good fortune to enjoy a tete-a-tete with her during\na whole hour, which he employed with such consummate skill, that her\ncaution was almost overcome. He not only assailed her with the artillery\nof sighs, vows, prayers, and tears, but even pawned his honour in behalf\nof his love. He swore, with many imprecations, that although her heart\nwas surrendered to him at discretion, there was a principle within him,\nwhich would never allow him to injure such innocence and beauty; and the\ntransports of his passion had, upon this occasion so far overshot his\npurpose, that if she had demanded an explanation while he was thus\nagitated, he would have engaged himself to her wish by such ties as\nhe could not break with any regard to his reputation. But from such\nexpostulation she was deterred, partly by pride, and partly by the\ndread of finding herself mistaken in such an interesting conjecture.\nShe therefore enjoyed the present flattering appearance of her fate, was\nprevailed upon to accept the jewels which he purchased with part of his\nwinning at Bath, and, with the most enchanting condescension, submitted\nto a warm embrace when he took his leave, after having obtained\npermission to visit her as often as his inclination and convenience\nwould permit.\n\nIn his return to his own lodgings, he was buoyed up with his success to\nan extravagance of hope, already congratulated himself upon his triumph\nover Emilia's virtue, and began to project future conquests among the\nmost dignified characters of the female sex. But his attention was not\nat all dissipated by these vain reflections; he resolved to concentrate\nthe whole exertion of his soul upon the execution of his present plan,\ndesisted, in the meantime, from all other schemes of pleasure, interest,\nand ambition, and took lodgings in the city, for the more commodious\naccomplishment of his purpose. While our lover's imagination was thus\nagreeably regaled, his mistress did not enjoy her expectations without\nthe intervention of doubts and anxiety. His silence, touching the\nfinal aim of his addresses, was a mystery on which she was afraid of\nexercising her sagacity; and her uncle tormented her with inquiries into\nthe circumstances of Peregrine's professions and deportment. Rather than\ngive this relation the least cause for suspicion, which must have cut\noff all intercourse betwixt her and her admirer, she said everything\nwhich she thought would satisfy his care and concern for her welfare;\nand, in consequence of such representation, she enjoyed, without\nreserve, the company of our adventurer, who prosecuted his plan with\nsurprising eagerness and perseverance.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVI.\n\n\n\nHe prevails upon Emilia to accompany him to a Masquerade, makes a\ntreacherous Attempt upon her Affection, and meets with a deserved\nRepulse.\n\n\nScarce a night elapsed in which he did not conduct her to some public\nentertainment. When, by the dint of his insidious carriage, he thought\nhimself in full possession of her confidence and affection, he lay in\nwait for an opportunity; and, hearing her observe in conversation, that\nshe had never been at a masquerade, begged leave to attend her to the\nnext ball; at the same time extending his invitation to the young lady\nin whose company he had found her at the play, she being present when\nthis subject of discourse was introduced. He had flattered himself,\nthat this gentlewoman would decline the proposal, as she was a person\nseemingly of a demure disposition, who had been born and bred in the\ncity, where such diversions are looked upon as scenes of lewdness and\ndebauchery. For once, however, he reckoned without his host; curiosity\nis as prevalent in the city as at the court end of the town. Emilia no\nsooner signified her assent to his proposal, than her friend, with an\nair of satisfaction, agreed to make one of the party; and he was obliged\nto thank her for that complaisance, which laid him under infinite\nmortification. He set his genius at work to invent some scheme for\npreventing her unseasonable intrusion. Had an opportunity offered, he\nwould have acted as her physician, and administered a medicine that\nwould have laid her under the necessity of staying at home. But his\nacquaintance with her being too slight to furnish him with the means of\nexecuting this expedient, he devised another, which was practised with\nall imaginable success. Understanding that her grandmother had left her\na sum of money independent of her parents, he conveyed a letter to\nher mother, intimating, that her daughter, on pretence of going to the\nmasquerade, intended to bestow herself in marriage to a certain person,\nand that in a few days she would be informed of the circumstances of\nthe whole intrigue, provided she would keep this information secret,\nand contrive some excuse for detaining the young lady at home, without\ngiving her cause to believe she was apprised of her intention. This\nbillet, subscribed \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour well-wisher, and unknown humble servant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n had the desired effect upon the careful matron, who, on the ball day,\nfeigned herself so extremely ill, that Miss could not with any decency\nquit her mamma's apartment; and therefore sent her apology to Emilia in\nthe afternoon, immediately after the arrival of Peregrine, who pretended\nto be very much afflicted with the disappointment, while his heart\nthrobbed with a transport of joy.\n\nAbout ten o'clock the lovers set out for the Haymarket, he being dressed\nin the habit of Pantaloon, and she in that of Columbine; and they had\nscarce entered the house when the music struck up, the curtain was\nwithdrawn, and the whole scene displayed at once, to the admiration of\nEmilia, whose expectation was infinitely surpassed by this exhibition.\nOur gallant having conducted her through all the different apartments,\nand described the economy of the place, led her into the circle, and, in\ntheir turn, they danced several minuets; then going to the sideboard,\nhe prevailed upon her to eat some sweetmeats and drink a glass of\nchampagne. After a second review of the company, they engaged in country\ndances, at which exercise they continued until our adventurer concluded\nthat his partner's blood was sufficiently warm for the prosecution of\nhis design. On this supposition, which was built upon her declaring\nthat she was thirsty and fatigued, he persuaded her to take a little\nrefreshment and repose; and, for that purpose, handed her downstairs\ninto the eating-room, where, having seated her on the floor, he\npresented her with a glass of wine and water; and, as she complained of\nbeing faint, enriched the draught with some drops of a certain elixir,\nwhich he recommended as a most excellent restorative, though it was no\nother than a stimulating tincture, which he had treacherously provided\nfor the occasion. Having swallowed this potion, by which her spirits\nwere manifestly exhilarated, she ate a slice of ham, with the wing of a\ncold pullet, and concluded the meal with a glass of burgundy, which\nshe drank at the earnest entreaty of her admirer. These extraordinary\ncordials co-operating with the ferment of her blood, which was heated by\nviolent motion, could not fail to affect the constitution of a delicate\nyoung creature, who was naturally sprightly and volatile. Her eyes began\nto sparkle with unusual fire and vivacity, a thousand brilliant sallies\nof wit escaped her, and every mask that accosted her underwent some\nsmarting repartee.\n\nPeregrine, overjoyed at the success of his administration, proposed that\nthey should resume their places at the country dances, with a view to\npromote and assist the efficacy of his elixir; and, when he thought her\ndisposition was properly adapted for the theme, began to ply her with\nall the elocution of love. In order to elevate his own spirits to\nthat pitch of resolution which his scheme required, he drank two whole\nbottles of burgundy, which inflamed his passion to such a degree, that\nhe found himself capable of undertaking and perpetrating any scheme for\nthe gratification of his desire.\n\nEmilia, warmed by so many concurring incentives, in favour of the man\nshe loved, abated considerably of her wonted reserve, listened to his\nprotestations with undissembled pleasure, and, in the confidence of her\nsatisfaction, even owned him absolute master of her affections. Ravished\nwith this confession, he now deemed himself on the brink of reaping the\ndelicious fruits of his art and assiduity; and the morning being already\npretty far advanced, assented with rapture to the first proposal she\nmade of retiring to her lodgings. The blinds of the chariot being pulled\nup, he took advantage of the favourable situation of her thoughts;\nand, on pretence of being whimsical, in consequence of the wine he had\nswallowed, clasped her in his arms, and imprinted a thousand kisses\non her pouting lips, a freedom which she pardoned as the privilege of\nintoxication. While he thus indulged himself with impunity, the carriage\nhalted, and Pipes opening the door, his master handed her into the\npassage, before she perceived that it was not her uncle's house at which\nthey had alighted.\n\nAlarmed at this discovery, she, with some confusion, desired to know his\nreason for conducting her to a strange place at these hours. But he made\nno reply, until he had led her into an apartment, when he gave her to\nunderstand, that, as her uncle's family must be disturbed by her going\nthither so late in the night, and the streets near Temple-bar were\ninfested by a multitude of robbers and cut-throats, he had ordered his\ncoachman to halt at this house, which was kept by a relation of his, a\nmighty good sort of a gentlewoman, who would be proud of an opportunity\nto accommodate a person for whom he was known to entertain such\ntenderness and esteem.\n\nEmilia had too much penetration to be imposed upon by this plausible\npretext. In spite of her partiality for Peregrine, which had never been\ninflamed to such a pitch of complacency before, she comprehended his\nwhole plan in a twinkling. Though her blood boiled with indignation, she\nthanked him with an affected air of serenity for his kind concern, and\nexpressed her obligation to his cousin; but, at the same time, insisted\nupon going home, lest her absence should terrify her uncle and aunt,\nwho, she knew, would not retire to rest till her return.\n\nHe urged her, with a thousand remonstrances, to consult her own ease and\nsafety, promising to send Pipes into the city, for the satisfaction of\nher relations. But, finding her obstinately deaf to his entreaties, he\nassured her, that he would, in a few minutes, comply with her request;\nand, in the meantime, begged she would fortify herself against the cold\nwith a cordial, which he poured out in her presence, and which, now that\nher suspicion was aroused, she refused to taste, notwithstanding all\nhis importunities. He then fell on his knees before her, and the tears\ngushing from his eyes, swore that his passion was wound up to such a\npitch of impatience, that he could no longer live upon the unsubstantial\nfood of expectation; and that, if she would not vouchsafe to crown his\nhappiness, he would forthwith sacrifice himself to her disdain. Such an\nabrupt address, accompanied with all the symptoms of frantic agitation,\ncould not fail to perplex and affright the gentle Emilia, who, after\nsome recollection, replied with a resolute tone, that she could not\nsee what reason he had to complain of her reserve, which she was not\nat liberty to lay entirely aside, until he should have avowed his\nintentions in form, and obtained the sanction of those whom it was\nher duty to obey. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDivine creature!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he, seizing her hand,\nand pressing it to his lips, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is from you alone I hope for that\ncondescension, which would overwhelm me with the transports of celestial\nbliss. The sentiments of parents are sordid, silly, and confined. I\nmean not then to subject my passion to such low restrictions as were\ncalculated for the purposes of common life. My love is too delicate and\nrefined to wear those vulgar fetters, which serve only to destroy the\nmerit of voluntary affection, and to upbraid a man incessantly with the\narticles of compulsion, under which he lies. My dear angel! spare me the\nmortification of being compelled to love you, and reign sole empress\nof my heart and fortune. I will not affront you so much as to talk of\nsettlements; my all is at your disposal. In this pocket-book are notes\nto the amount of two thousand pounds; do me the pleasure to accept of\nthem; to-morrow I will lay ten thousand more in your lap. In a word, you\nshall be mistress of my whole estate, and I shall think myself happy in\nliving dependent on your bounty!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHeavens! what were the emotions of the virtuous, the sensible, the\ndelicate, the tender Emilia's heart, when she heard this insolent\ndeclaration from the mouth of a man whom she had honoured with her\naffection and esteem! It was not simply horror, grief, or indignation,\nthat she felt, in consequence of this unworthy treatment, but the united\npangs of all together, which produced a sort of hysteric laughter, while\nshe told him that she could not help admiring his generosity.\n\nDeceived by this convulsion, and the ironical compliment that attended\nit, the lover thought he had already made great progress in his\noperations, and that it was now his business to storm the fort by a\nvigorous assault, that he might spare her the confusion of yielding\nwithout resistance. Possessed by this vain suggestion, he started up,\nand, folding her in his arms, began to obey the furious dictates of his\nunruly and ungenerous desire. With an air of cool determination, she\ndemanded a parley; and when, upon her repeated request, he granted it,\naddressed herself to him in these words, while her eyes gleamed with all\nthe dignity of the most awful resentment:--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir, I scorn to upbraid you with a repetition of your former vows\nand protestations, nor will I recapitulate the little arts you have\npractised to ensnare my heart; because, though by dint of the most\nperfidious dissimulation you have found means to deceive my opinion,\nyour utmost efforts have never been able to lull the vigilance of my\nconduct, or to engage my affection beyond the power of discarding you\nwithout a tear, whenever my honour should demand such a sacrifice.\nSir, you are unworthy of my concern or regret, and the sigh that now\nstruggles from my breast is the result of sorrow, for my own want of\ndiscernment. As for your present attempt upon my chastity, I despise\nyour power, as I detest your intention. Though, under the mask of the\nmost delicate respect, you have decoyed me from the immediate protection\nof my friends, and contrived other impious stratagems to ruin my\npeace and reputation, I confide too much in my own innocence, and the\nauthority of the law, to admit one thought of fear, much less to sink\nunder the horror of this shocking situation, into which I have been\nseduced. Sir, your behaviour on this occasion is, in all respects, low\nand contemptible. For, ruffian as you are, you durst not harbour the\nthought of executing your execrable scheme, while you knew my brother\nwas near enough to prevent or revenge the insult; so that you must not\nonly be a treacherous villain, but also a most despicable coward.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaving expressed herself in this manner, with a most majestic severity\nof aspect, she opened the door, and walking down-stairs with\nsurprising resolution, committed herself to the care of a watchman, who\naccommodated her with a hackney-chair, in which she was safely conveyed\nto her uncle's house.\n\nMeanwhile, the lover was so confounded and overawed by these cutting\nreproaches, and her animated behaviour, that all his resolution forsook\nhim, and he found himself not only incapable of obstructing her retreat,\nbut even of uttering one syllable to deprecate her wrath, or extenuate\nthe guilt of his own conduct. The nature of his disappointment, and the\nkeen remorse that seized him, when he reflected upon the dishonourable\nfooting on which his character stood with Emilia, raised such\nperturbation in his mind, that his silence was succeeded by a violent\nfit of distraction, during which he raved like a bedlamite, and acted\na thousand extravagancies, which convinced the people of the house, a\ncertain bagnio, that he had actually lost his wits. Pipes, with great\nconcern, adopted the same opinion; and, being assisted by the waiters,\nhindered him, by main force, from running out and pursuing the fair\nfugitive, whom, in his delirium, he alternately cursed and commended\nwith horrid imprecations and lavish applause. His faithful valet,\nhaving waited two whole hours, in hopes of seeing this gust of passion\noverblown, and perceiving that the paroxysm seemed rather to increase,\nvery prudently sent for a physician of his master's acquaintance,\nwho, having considered the circumstances and symptoms of the disorder,\ndirected that he should be plentifully blooded, without loss of time,\nand prescribed a draught to compose the tumult of his spirits. These\norders being punctually performed, he grew more calm and tractable,\nrecovered his reflection so far as to be ashamed of the ecstasy he had\nundergone, and suffered himself quietly to be undressed and put to\nbed, where the fatigue occasioned by his exercise at the masquerade\nco-operated with the present dissipation of his spirits to lull him\ninto a profound sleep, which greatly tended to the preservation of his\nintellects. Not that he found himself in a state of perfect tranquility\nwhen he waked about noon. The remembrance of what had passed overwhelmed\nhim with mortification. Emilia's invectives still sounded in his ears.\nAnd, while he deeply resented her disdain, he could not help admiring\nher spirit, and his heart did homage to her charms.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVII.\n\n\n\nHe endeavours to Reconcile himself to his Mistress, and Expostulates\nwith the Uncle, who forbids him the House.\n\n\nIn this state of division, he went home to his own lodgings in a chair;\nand while he deliberated with himself whether he should relinquish\nthe pursuit, and endeavour to banish her idea from his breast, or go\nimmediately and humble himself before his exasperated mistress, and\noffer his hand as an atonement for his crime, his servant put in his\nhand a packet, which had been delivered by a ticket porter at the\ndoor. He no sooner perceived that the superscription was in Emilia's\nhandwriting, than he guessed the nature of the contents; and, opening\nthe seal with disordered eagerness, found the jewels he had given to her\nenclosed in a billet, couched in these words:--\n\n     \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat I may have no cause to reproach myself with having\n     retained the least memorial of a wretch whom I equally\n     despise and abhor, I take this opportunity of restoring\n     these ineffectual instruments of his infamous design upon\n     the honour of\n\n     \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmilia.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis chagrin was so much galled and inflamed at the bitterness of this\ncontemptuous message, that he gnawed his fingers till the blood ran\nover his nails, and even wept with vexation. Sometimes he vowed revenge\nagainst her haughty virtue, and reviled himself for his precipitate\ndeclaration, before his scheme was brought to maturity; then he would\nconsider her behaviour with reverence and regard, and bow before the\nirresistible power of her attractions. In short, his breast was torn by\nconflicting passions: love, shame, and remorse, contended with vanity,\nambition, and revenge; and the superiority was still doubtful when\nheadstrong desire interposed, and decided in favour of an attempt\ntowards a reconciliation with the offended fair.\n\nImpelled by this motive, he set out in the afternoon for the house of\nher uncle, not without hopes of that tender enjoyment, which never fails\nto attend an accommodation betwixt two lovers of taste and sensibility.\nThough the consciousness of his trespass encumbered him with an air of\nawkward confusion, he was too confident of his own qualifications and\naddress to despair of forgiveness; and, by that time he arrived at the\ncitizen's gate, he had conned a very artful and pathetic harangue, which\nhe proposed to utter in his own behalf, laying the blame of his conduct\non the impetuosity of his passion, increased by the burgundy which he\nhad too liberally drunk; but he did not meet with an opportunity to\navail himself of this preparation. Emilia, suspecting that he would\ntake some step of this kind to retrieve her favour, had gone abroad\non pretence of visiting, after having signified to her kinsman her\nresolution to avoid the company of Peregrine, on account of some\nambiguities which, she said, were last night remarkable in his demeanour\nat the masquerade. She chose to insinuate her suspicion in these hints,\nrather than give an explicit detail of the young man's dishonourable\ncontrivance, which might have kindled the resentment of the family to\nsome dangerous pitch of animosity and revenge.\n\nOur adventurer, finding himself baffled in his expectation of seeing\nher, inquired for the old gentleman, with whom he thought he had\ninfluence enough to make his apology good, in case he should find\nhim prepossessed by the young lady's information. But here too he was\ndisappointed, the uncle having gone to dine in the country, and his wife\nwas indisposed; so that he had no pretext for staying in the house till\nthe return of his charmer. Being, however, fruitful of expedients, he\ndismissed his chariot, and took possession of a room in a tavern, the\nwindows of which fronted the merchant's gate; and there he proposed to\nwatch until he should see her approach. This scheme he put in practice\nwith indefatigable patience, though it was not attended with the\nexpected success.\n\nEmilia, whose caution was equally vigilant and commendable, foreseeing\nthat she might be exposed to the fertility of his invention, came home\nby a private passage, and entered by a postern, which was altogether\nunknown to her admirer; and her uncle did not arrive until it was so\nlate that he could not, with any decency, demand a conference.\n\nNext morning, he did not fail to present himself at the door, and his\nmistress being denied by her own express direction, insisted upon\nseeing the master of the house, who received him with such coldness of\ncivility, as plainly gave him to understand that he was acquainted with\nthe displeasure of his niece. He, therefore, with an air of candour,\ntold the citizen, he could easily perceive by his behaviour that he was\nthe confidant of Miss Emily, of whom he was come to ask pardon for the\noffence he had given; and did not doubt, if he could be admitted to her\npresence, that he should be able to convince her that he had not erred\nintentionally, or at least propose such reparation as would effectually\natone for his fault.\n\nTo this remonstrance the merchant, without any ceremony or\ncircumlocution, answered, that though he was ignorant of the nature of\nhis offence, he was very certain, that it must have been something\nvery flagrant that could irritate his niece to such a degree, against a\nperson for whom she had formerly a most particular regard. He owned, she\nhad declared her intention to renounce his acquaintance for ever, and,\ndoubtless, she had good reason for so doing; neither would he undertake\nto promote an accommodation, unless he would give him full power to\ntreat on the score of matrimony, which he supposed would be the only\nmeans of evincing his own sincerity, and obtaining Emilia's forgiveness.\nPeregrine's pride was kindled by this blunt declaration, which he could\nnot help considering as the result of a scheme concerted betwixt the\nyoung lady and her uncle, in order to take advantage of his heat. He\ntherefore replied, with manifest signs of disgust, that he did not\napprehend there was any occasion for a mediator to reconcile the\ndifference betwixt Emilia and him; and that all he desired was an\nopportunity of pleading in his own behalf. The citizen frankly told\nhim, that, as his niece had expressed an earnest desire of avoiding his\ncompany, he would not put the least constraint upon her inclination;\nand, in the meantime, gave him to know, that he was particularly\nengaged. Our hero, glowing with indignation at this supercilious\ntreatment, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was in the wrong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto look for good manners so\nfar on this side of Temple-bar; but you must give me leave to tell you,\nsir, that unless I am favoured with an interview with Miss Gauntlet,\nI shall conclude that you have actually laid a constraint upon her\ninclination, for some sinister purposes of your own.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied\nthe old gentleman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are welcome to make what conclusions shall seem\ngood unto your own imagination; but pray be so good as to allow me\nthe privilege of being master in my own house.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he very\ncomplaisantly showed him to the door; and our lover being diffident of\nhis own temper, as well as afraid of being used with greater indignity,\nin a place where his personal prowess would only serve to heighten his\ndisgrace, quitted the house in a transport of rage, which he could not\nwholly suppress, telling the landlord, that if his age did not protect\nhim, he would have chastised him for his insolent behaviour.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVIII.\n\n\n\nHe projects a violent Scheme, in consequence of which he is involved in\na most fatiguing Adventure, which greatly tends towards the Augmentation\nof his Chagrin.\n\n\nThus debarred of personal communication with his mistress, he essayed\nto retrieve her good graces by the most submissive and pathetic letters,\nwhich he conveyed by divers artifices to her perusal; but, reaping no\nmanner of benefit from these endeavours, his passion acquired a degree\nof impatience little inferior to downright frenzy; and he determined to\nrun every risk of life, fortune, and reputation, rather than desist\nfrom his unjustifiable pursuit. Indeed, his resentment was now as deeply\nconcerned as his love, and each of these passions equally turbulent and\nloud in demanding gratification. He kept sentinels continually in pay,\nto give him notice of her outgoings, in expectation of finding some\nopportunity to carry her off; but her circumspection entirely\nfrustrated this design, for she suspected everything of that sort from a\ndisposition like his, and regulated her motions accordingly.\n\nBaffled by her prudence and penetration, he altered his plan. On\npretence of being called to his country house by some affair of\nimportance, he departed from London, and, taking lodgings at a farmer's\nhouse that stood near the road through which she must have necessarily\npassed in her return to her mother, concealed himself from all\nintercourse, except with his valet-de-chambre and Pipes, who had orders\nto scour the country, and reconnoitre every horse, coach, or carriage,\nthat should appear on that highway, with a view of intercepting his\nEmilia in her passage.\n\nHe had waited in this ambuscade a whole week, when his valet gave him\nnotice, that he and his fellow-scout had discovered a chaise-and-six,\ndriving at full speed towards them; upon which they had flapped their\nhats over their eyes, so as they might not be known, in case they should\nbe seen, and concealed themselves behind a hedge, from whence they could\nperceive in the carriage, as it passed, a young man plainly dressed,\nwith a lady in a mask, of the exact size, shape, and air of Emilia;\nand that Pipes followed them at a distance, while he rode back to\ncommunicate this piece of intelligence.\n\nPeregrine would scarce allow him time to conclude his information. He\nran down to the stable, where his horse was kept ready saddled for the\npurpose, and, never doubting that the lady in question was his mistress,\nattended by one of her uncle's clerks, mounted immediately, and rode\nfull gallop after the chaise, which, when he had proceeded about two\nmiles, he understood from Pipes, had put up at a neighbouring inn.\nThough his inclination prompted him to enter her apartment without\nfurther delay, he suffered himself to be dissuaded from taking such a\nprecipitate step, by his privy counsellor, who observed, that it would\nbe impracticable to execute his purpose of conveying her against her\nwill from a public inn, that stood in the midst of a populous village,\nwhich would infallibly rise in her defence. He advised him therefore to\nbe in wait for the chaise, in some remote and private part of the road,\nwhere they might accomplish their aim without difficulty or danger.\nIn consequence of this admonition our adventurer ordered Pipes to\nreconnoitre the inn, that she might not escape another way, while he\nand the valet, in order to avoid being seen, took a circuit by an\nunfrequented path, and placed themselves in ambush, on a spot which they\nchose for the scene of their achievement. Here they tarried a full hour,\nwithout seeing the carriage, or hearing from their sentinel. So that\nthe youth, unable to exert his patience one moment longer, left the\nforeigner in his station, and rode back to his faithful lacquey, who\nassured him, that the travellers had not yet hove up their anchor, or\nproceeded on their voyage.\n\nNotwithstanding this information, Pickle began to entertain such\nalarming suspicions, that he could not refrain from advancing to\nthe gate, and inquire for the company which had lately arrived in a\nchaise-and-six. The innkeeper, who was not at all pleased with the\nbehaviour of those passengers, did not think proper to observe the\ninstructions he had received: on the contrary, he plainly told him, that\nthe chaise did not halt, but only entered at one door, and went out at\nthe other, with a view to deceive those who pursued it, as he guessed\nfrom the words of the gentleman, who had earnestly desired that his\nroute might be concealed from any person who should inquire about their\nmotions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs for my own peart, measter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued this charitable\npublican, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believes as how they are no better than they should\nbe, else they wouldn't be in such a deadly fear of being overtaken.\nMethinks, said I, when I saw them in such a woundy pother to be gone,\noddsheartlikins! this must be some London 'prentice running away with\nhis measter's daughter, as sure as I'm a living soul. But, be he who he\nwill, sartain it is, a has nothing of the gentleman about en; for, thof\na asked such a favour, a never once put hand in pocket, or said, 'Dog,\nwill you drink?' Howsomever, that don't argufy in reverence of his being\nin a hurry; and a man may be sometimes a little too judgmatical in his\nconjectures.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In all probability, this loquacious landlord would have\nserved the travellers effectually, had Peregrine heard him to an end;\nbut this impetuous youth, far from listening to the sequel of his\nobservations, interrupted him in the beginning of his career, by asking\neagerly which road they followed; and, having received the innkeeper's\ndirections, clapped spurs to his horse, commanding Pipes to make the\nvalet acquainted with the course, that they might attend him with all\nimaginable despatch.\n\nBy the publican's account of their conduct, his former opinion was fully\nconfirmed. He plied his steed to the height of his mettle; and so much\nwas his imagination engrossed by the prospect of having Emilia in his\npower, that he did not perceive the road on which he travelled was quite\ndifferent from that which led to the habitation of Mrs. Gauntlet. The\nvalet-de-chambre was an utter stranger to that part of the country; and,\nas for Mr. Pipes, such considerations were altogether foreign to the\neconomy of his reflection.\n\nTen long miles had our hero rode, when his eyes were blessed with the\nsight of the chaise ascending an hill, at the distance of a good league;\nupon which he doubled his diligence in such a manner, that he gained\nupon the carriage every minute, and at length approached so near to\nit, that he could discern the lady and her conductor, with their heads\nthrust out at the windows, looking back, and speaking to the driver\nalternately, as if they earnestly besought him to augment the speed of\nhis cattle.\n\nBeing thus, as it were, in sight of port, while he crossed the road, his\nhorse happened to plunge into a cart-rut with such violence, that he\nwas thrown several yards over his head; and, the beast's shoulder being\nslipped by the fall, he found himself disabled from plucking the fruit,\nwhich was almost within his reach; for he had left his servants at a\nconsiderable distance behind him; and although they had been at his\nback, and supplied him with another horse, they were so indifferently\nmounted, that he could not reasonably expect to overtake the flyers, who\nprofited so much by this disaster that the chaise vanished in a moment.\n\nIt may be easily conceived how a young man of his disposition passed his\ntime, in this tantalizing situation. He ejaculated with great fervency;\nbut his prayers were not the effects of resignation. He ran back\non foot, with incredible speed, in order to meet his valet, whom he\nunhorsed in a twinkling, and, taking his seat, began to exercise his\nwhip and spurs, after having ordered the Swiss to follow him on the\nother gelding, and committed the lame hunter to the care of Pipes.\n\nMatters being adjusted in this manner, our adventurer prosecuted the\nrace with all his might; and, having made some progress, was informed\nby a countryman, that the chaise had struck off into another road, and,\naccording to his judgment, was by that time about three miles ahead;\nthough, in all probability, the horses would not be able to hold out\nmuch longer, because they seemed to be quite spent when they passed\nhis door. Encouraged by this intimation, Peregrine pushed on with great\nalacrity, though he could not regain sight of the desired object, till\nthe clouds of night began to deepen, and even then he enjoyed nothing\nmore than a transient glimpse; for the carriage was no sooner seen, than\nshrouded again from his view. These vexatious circumstances animated his\nendeavours, while they irritated his chagrin. In short, he continued his\npursuit, till the night was far advanced, and himself so uncertain about\nthe object of his care, that he entered a solitary inn, with a view of\nobtaining some intelligence, when, to his infinite joy, he perceived the\nchaise standing by itself, and the horses panting in the yard.\n\nIn full confidence of his having arrived at last at the goal of all his\nwishes, he alighted instantaneously, and, running up to the coachman,\nwith a pistol in his hand, commanded him, in an imperious tone, to\nconduct him to the lady's chamber, on pain of death. The driver,\naffrighted at this menacing address, protested, with great humility,\nthat he did not know whither his fare had retired; for that he himself\nwas paid and dismissed from the service, because he would not undertake\nto drive them all night across the country without stopping to refresh\nhis horses. But he promised to go in quest of the waiter, who would\nshow him to their apartment. He was accordingly detached on that errand,\nwhile our hero stood sentinel at the gate, till the arrival of his\nvalet-de-chambre, who, joining him by accident, before the coachman\nreturned, relieved him in his watch; and then the young gentleman,\nexasperated at his messenger's delay, rushed, with fury in his eyes,\nfrom room to room, denouncing vengeance upon the whole family; but he\ndid not meet with one living soul, until he entered the garret, where he\nfound the landlord and his wife in bed. This chicken-hearted couple, by\nthe light of a rush candle that burned on the hearth, seeing a stranger\nburst into the chamber, in such a terrible attitude, were seized with\nconsternation; and, exalting their voices, in a most lamentable strain,\nbegged, for the passion of Christ, that he would spare their lives, and\ntake all they had.\n\nPeregrine guessing, from this exclamation, and the circumstance of their\nbeing abed, that they mistook him for a robber, and were ignorant of\nthat which he wanted to know, dispelled their terror, by making them\nacquainted with the cause of his visit, and desired the husband to get\nup with all possible despatch, in order to assist and attend him in his\nsearch.\n\nThus reinforced, he rummaged every corner of the inn, and at last,\nfinding the hostler in the stable, was by him informed, to his\nunspeakable mortification, that the gentleman and lady who arrived in\nthe chaise, had immediately hired post-horses for a certain village\nat the distance of fifteen miles, and departed without halting for the\nleast refreshment. Our adventurer, mad with his disappointment, mounted\nhis horse in an instant, and, with his attendant, took the same road,\nwith full determination to die, rather than desist from the prosecution\nof his design. He had, by this time, rode upwards of thirty miles, since\nthree o'clock in the afternoon; so that the horses were almost quite\njaded, and travelled this stage so slowly, that it was morning before\nthey reached the place of their destination, where, far from finding the\nfugitives, he understood that no such persons as he described had passed\nthat way, and that, in all likelihood, they had taken a quite contrary\ndirection, while in order to mislead him in his pursuit, they had amused\nthe hostler with a false route. This conjecture was strengthened by his\nperceiving, now for the first time, that he had deviated a considerable\nway from the road, through which they must have journeyed, in order to\narrive at the place of her mother's residence; and these suggestions\nutterly deprived him of the small remains of recollection which he\nhad hitherto retained. His eyes rolled about, witnessing rage and\ndistraction; he foamed at the mouth, stamped upon the ground with\ngreat violence, uttered incoherent imprecations against himself and all\nmankind, and would have sallied forth again, he knew not whither, upon\nthe same horse, which he had already almost killed with fatigue, had\nnot his confidant found means to quiet the tumult of his thoughts,\nand recall his reflection, by representing the condition of the poor\nanimals, and advising him to hire fresh horses, and ride post across\nthe country, to the village in the neighbourhood of Mrs. Gauntlet's\nhabitation, where they should infallibly intercept the daughter,\nprovided they could get the start of her upon the road.\n\nPeregrine not only relished, but forthwith acted in conformity with\nthis good counsel. His own horses were committed to the charge of the\nlandlord, with directions for Pipes, in case he should come in quest of\nhis master: and, a couple of stout geldings being prepared, he and\nhis valet took the road again, steering their course according to the\nmotions of the post-boy, who undertook to be their guide. They had\nalmost finished the first stage, when they descried a post-chaise just\nhalting at the inn where they proposed to change horses; upon which our\nadventurer, glowing with a most interesting presage, put his beast\nto the full speed, and approached near enough to distinguish, as the\ntravellers quitted the carriage, that he had at last come up with the\nvery individual persons whom he had pursued so long.\n\nFlushed with this discovery, he galloped into the yard so suddenly, that\nthe lady and her conductor scarce had time to shut themselves up in a\nchamber, to which they retreated with great precipitation; so that\nthe pursuer was now certain of having housed his prey. That he might,\nhowever, leave nothing to fortune, he placed himself upon the stair by\nwhich they had ascended to the apartment, and sent up his compliments to\nthe young lady, desiring the favour of being admitted to her presence,\notherwise he should be obliged to waive all ceremony, and take that\nliberty which she would not give. The servant, having conveyed his\nmessage through the keyhole, returned with an answer, importing that she\nwould adhere to the resolution she had taken, and perish, rather than\ncomply with his will. Our adventurer, without staying to make any\nrejoinder to this reply, ran upstairs, and, thundering at the door\nfor entrance, was given to understand by the nymph's attendant, that\na blunderbuss was ready primed for his reception, and that he would do\nwell to spare him the necessity of shedding blood in defence of a person\nwho had put herself under his protection. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll the laws of the land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccannot now untie the knots by which we are bound together; and\ntherefore I will guard her as my own property; so that you had better\ndesist from your fruitless attempt, and thereby consult your own safety;\nfor, by the God that made me! I will discharge my piece upon you, as\nsoon as you set your nose within the door; and your blood be upon your\nown head.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese menaces, from a citizen's clerk, would have been sufficient\nmotives for Pickle to storm the breach, although they had not been\nreinforced by that declaration, which informed him of Emilia's having\nbestowed herself in marriage upon such a contemptible rival. This sole\nconsideration added wings to his impetuosity, and he applied his foot to\nthe door with such irresistible force, as burst it open in an instant,\nentering at the same time with a pistol ready cocked in his hand. His\nantagonist, instead of firing his blunderbuss, when he saw him\napproach, started back with evident signs of surprise and consternation,\nexclaiming, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLord Jesus! Sir, you are not the man! and, without doubt,\nare under some mistake with regard to us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Before Peregrine had time\nto answer this salutation, the lady, hearing it, advanced to him, and,\npulling off a mask, discovered a face which he had never seen before.\nThe Gorgon's head, according to the fables of antiquity, never had\na more instantaneous or petrifying effect, than that which this\ncountenance produced upon the astonished youth. His eyes were fixed\nupon this unknown object, as if they had been attracted by the power of\nenchantment, his feet seemed riveted to the ground, and, after having\nstood motionless for the space of a few minutes, he dropped down in an\napoplexy of disappointment and despair. The Swiss, who had followed him,\nseeing his master in this condition, lifted him up, and, laying him upon\na bed in the next room, let him blood immediately, without hesitation,\nbeing always provided with a case of lancets, against all accidents on\nthe road. To this foresight our hero, in all probability, was indebted\nfor his life. By virtue of a very copious evacuation, he recovered\nthe use of his senses; but the complication of fatigues and violent\ntransports, which he had undergone, brewed up a dangerous fever in his\nblood; and, a physician being called from the next market-town, several\ndays elapsed before he would answer for his life.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIX.\n\n\n\nPeregrine sends a Message to Mrs. Gauntlet, who rejects his Proposal--He\nrepairs to the Garrison.\n\n\nAt length, however, his constitution overcame his disease, though not\nbefore it had in a great measure tamed the fury of his disposition,\nand brought him to a serious consideration of his conduct. In this\nhumiliation of his spirits, he reflected with shame and remorse upon\nhis treachery to the fair, the innocent Emilia; he remembered his former\nsentiments in her favour, as well as the injunctions of his dying uncle;\nhe recollected his intimacy with her brother, against which he had so\nbasely sinned; and, revolving all the circumstances of her conduct,\nfound it so commendable, spirited, and noble, that he deemed her an\nobject of sufficient dignity to merit his honourable addresses, even\nthough his duty had not been concerned in this decision. But, obligated\nas he was to make reparation to a worthy family, which he had so grossly\ninjured, he thought he could not manifest his reformation too soon; and,\nwhenever he found himself able to hold a pen, wrote a letter to Mrs.\nGauntlet, wherein he acknowledged, with many expressions of sorrow and\ncontrition, that he had acted a part altogether unbecoming a man of\nhonour, and should never enjoy the least tranquility of mind, until he\nshould have merited her forgiveness. He protested, that, although his\nhappiness entirely depended upon the determination of Emilia, he would\neven renounce all hope of being blessed with her favour, if she could\npoint out any other method of making reparation to that amiable young\nlady, but by laying his heart and fortune at her feet, and submitting\nhimself to her pleasure during the remaining part of his life. He\nconjured her, therefore, in the most pathetic manner, to pardon him,\nin consideration of his sincere repentance, and to use her maternal\ninfluence with her daughter, so as that he might be permitted to wait\nupon her with a wedding ring, as soon as his health would allow him to\nundertake the journey.\n\nThis explanation being despatched by Pipes, who had, by this time, found\nhis master, the young gentleman inquired about the couple whom he had\nso unfortunately pursued, and understood from his valet-de-chambre,\nwho learned the story from their own mouths, that the lady was the only\ndaughter of a rich Jew, and her attendant no other than his apprentice,\nwho had converted her to Christianity, and married her at the same time;\nthat this secret having taken air, the old Israelite had contrived\na scheme to separate them for ever; and they being apprised of his\nintention, had found means to elope from his house, with a view of\nsheltering themselves in France, until the affair could be made up;\nthat, seeing three men ride after them with such eagerness, they\nnever doubted that the pursuers were her father, and some friends, or\ndomestics, and on that supposition had fled with the utmost despatch and\ntrepidation, until they had found themselves happily undeceived, at that\nvery instant when they expected nothing but mischief and misfortune.\nLastly, the Swiss gave him to understand, that, after having professed\nsome concern for his deplorable situation, and enjoyed a slight\nrefreshment, they had taken their departure for Dover, and, in all\nlikelihood, were safely arrived at Paris.\n\nIn four-and-twenty hours after Pipes was charged with his commission,\nhe brought back an answer from the mother of Emilia, couched in these\nwords:--\n\n     Sir,--I received the favour of yours, and am glad, for your\n     own sake, that you have attained a due sense and conviction\n     of your unkind and unchristian behaviour to poor Emy. I thank\n     God, none of my children were ever so insulted before. Give\n     me leave to tell you, sir, my daughter was no upstart, without\n     friends or education, but a young lady, as well bred, and\n     better born, than most private gentlewomen in the kingdom;\n     and therefore, though you had no esteem for her person, you\n     ought to have paid some regard to her family, which, no\n     disparagement to you, sir, is more honourable than your own.\n     As for your proposal, Miss Gauntlet will not hear of it,\n     being that she thinks her honour will not allow her to listen\n     to any terms of reconciliation; and she is not yet so\n     destitute as to embrace an offer to which she has the least\n     objection. In the meantime, she is so much indisposed, that\n     she cannot possibly see company; so I beg you will not take\n     the trouble of making a fruitless journey to this place.\n     Perhaps your future conduct may deserve her forgiveness,\n     and really, as I am concerned for your happiness, which you\n     assure me depends upon her condescension, I wish with all my\n     heart it may; and am, notwithstanding all that has happened,\n     your sincere well-wisher.             \u00e2\u0080\u009cCecilia Gauntlet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFrom this epistle, and the information of his messenger, our hero\nlearned, that his mistress had actually profited by his wild-goose\nchase, so as to make a safe retreat to her mother's house. Though sorry\nto hear of her indisposition, he was also piqued at her implacability,\nas well as at some stately paragraphs of the letter, in which, he\nthought, the good lady had consulted her own vanity, rather than\nher good sense. These motives of resentment helped him to bear his\ndisappointment like a philosopher, especially as he had now quieted\nhis conscience, in proffering to redress the injury he had done; and,\nmoreover, found himself, with regard to his love, in a calm state of\nhope and resignation.\n\nA seasonable fit of illness is an excellent medicine for the turbulence\nof passion. Such a reformation had the fever produced on the economy of\nhis thoughts, that he moralized like an apostle, and projected several\nprudential schemes for his future conduct. In the meantime, as soon\nas his health was sufficiently re-established, he took a trip to the\ngarrison, in order to visit his friends; and learned from Hatchway's own\nmouth, that he had broke the ice of courtship to his aunt, and that his\naddresses were now fairly afloat; though, when he first declared himself\nto the widow, after she had been duly prepared for the occasion, by her\nniece and the rest of her friends, she had received his proposal with\na becoming reserve, and piously wept at the remembrance of her husband,\nobserving, that she should never meet with his fellow.\n\nPeregrine promoted the lieutenant's suit with all his influence, and\nall Mrs. Trunnion's objections to the match being surmounted, it was\ndetermined, that the day of marriage should be put off for three months,\nthat her reputation might not suffer by a precipitate engagement. His\nnext care was to give orders for erecting a plain marble monument to the\nmemory of his uncle, on which the following inscription, composed by the\nbridegroom, actually appeared in golden letters:\n\n                     Here lies,\n             Foundered in a fathom and half,\n                     The shell\n                         Of\n                 HAWSER TRUNNION, Esq.\n            Formerly commander of a squadron\n               In his Majesty's service,\n          Who broached to, at five P.M. Oct. 10,\n      In the year of his age threescore and nineteen.\n\n            He kept his guns always loaded,\n             And his tackle ready mann'd,\n        And never showed his poop to the enemy,\n            Except when he took her in tow;\n    But, His shot being expended, His match burnt out,\n             And his upper works decayed,\n    He was sunk by Death's superior weight of metal.\n\n                     Nevertheless,\n       He will be weighed again at the Great Day,\n      His rigging refitted, And his timbers repaired;\n                And, with one broadside,\n          Make his adversary strike in his turn.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXX.\n\n\n\nHe returns to London, and meets with Cadwallader, who entertains\nhim with many curious Particulars--Crabtree sounds the Duchess, and\nundeceives Pickle, who, by an extraordinary Accident, becomes acquainted\nwith another Lady of Quality.\n\n\nThe young gentleman having performed these last offices in honour of\nhis deceased benefactor, and presented Mr. Jolter to the long-expected\nliving, which at this time happened to be vacant, returned to London,\nand resumed his former gaiety: not that he was able to shake Emilia from\nhis thought, or even to remember her without violent emotions; for, as\nhe recovered his vigour, his former impatience recurred, and therefore\nhe resolved to plunge himself headlong into some intrigue, that might\nengage his passions and amuse his imagination.\n\nA man of his accomplishments could not fail to meet with a variety of\nsubjects on which his gallantry would have been properly exercised; and\nthis abundance distracted his choice, which at any time was apt to be\ninfluenced by caprice and whim. I have already observed, that he had\nlifted his view, through a matrimonial perspective, as high as a lady of\nthe first quality and distinction: and now, that he was refused by Miss\nGauntlet, and enjoyed a little respite from the agonies of that flame\nwhich her charms had kindled in his heart, he renewed his assiduities to\nher grace. Though he durst not yet risk an explanation, he enjoyed the\npleasure of seeing himself so well received in quality of a particular\nacquaintance, that he flattered himself with the belief of his having\nmade some progress in her heart; and was confirmed in this conceited\nnotion by the assurances of her woman, whom, by liberal largesses, he\nretained in his interest, because she found means to persuade him\nthat she was in the confidence of her lady. But, notwithstanding this\nencouragement, and the sanguine suggestions of his own vanity, he\ndreaded the thoughts of exposing himself to her ridicule and resentment\nby a premature declaration and determined to postpone his addresses,\nuntil he should be more certified of the probability of succeeding in\nhis attempt.\n\nWhile he remained in this hesitation and suspense, he was one morning\nvery agreeably surprised with the appearance of his friend Crabtree,\nwho, by the permission of Pipes, to whom he was well known, entered his\nchamber before he was awake, and, by a violent shake of the shoulder,\ndisengaged him from the arms of sleep. The first compliments having\nmutually passed, Cadwallader gave him to understand, that he had arrived\nin town overnight in the stage-coach from Bath, and entertained him with\nsuch a ludicrous account of his fellow-travellers, that Peregrine, for\nthe first time since their parting, indulged himself in mirth, even to\nthe hazard of suffocation.\n\nCrabtree, having rehearsed these adventures, in such a peculiarity of\nmanner as added infinite ridicule to every circumstance, and repeated\nevery scandalous report which had circulated at Bath, after Peregrine's\ndeparture, was informed by the youth, that he harboured a design upon\nthe person of such a duchess, and in all appearance had no reason to\ncomplain of his reception; but that he would not venture to declare\nhimself, until he should be more ascertained of her sentiments; and\ntherefore he begged leave to depend upon the intelligence of his friend\nCadwallader, who, he knew, was admitted to her parties.\n\nThe misanthrope, before he would promise his assistance, asked if his\nprospect verged towards matrimony; and our adventurer, who guessed the\nmeaning of his question, replying in the negative, he undertook the\noffice of reconnoitring her inclination, protesting at the same time,\nthat he would never concern himself in any scheme that did not tend\nto the disgrace and deception of all the sex. On these conditions he\nespoused the interest of our hero; and a plan was immediately concerted,\nin consequence of which they met by accident at her grace's table.\nPickle having staid all the forepart of the evening, and sat out all the\ncompany, except the misanthrope and a certain widow lady who was said\nto be in the secrets of my lady duchess, went away on pretence of an\nindispensable engagement, that Crabtree might have a proper opportunity\nof making him the subject of conversation.\n\nAccordingly, he had scarce quitted the apartment, when this cynic,\nattending him to the door with a look of morose disdain, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWere I an\nabsolute prince,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand that fellow one of my subjects, I would\norder him to be clothed in sackcloth, and he should drive my asses\nto water, that his lofty spirit might be lowered to the level of his\ndeserts. The pride of a peacock is downright self-denial, when compared\nwith the vanity of that coxcomb, which was naturally arrogant, but is\nnow rendered altogether intolerable, by the reputation he acquired at\nBath, for kicking a bully, outwitting a club of raw sharpers, and divers\nother pranks, in the execution of which he was more lucky than wise.\nBut nothing has contributed so much to the increase of his insolence and\nself-conceit, as the favour he found among the ladies; ay, the ladies,\nmadam: I care not who knows it: the ladies, who, to their honour be it\nspoken, never fail to patronize foppery and folly, provided they solicit\ntheir encouragement. And yet this dog was not on the footing of those\nhermaphroditical animals, who may be reckoned among the number of\nwaiting-women, who air your shifts, comb your lap-dogs, examine your\nnoses with magnifying glasses, in order to squeeze out the worms, clean\nyour tooth-brushes, sweeten your handkerchiefs, and soften waste\npaper for your occasions. This fellow Pickle was entertained for more\nimportant purposes; his turn of duty never came till all those lapwings\nwere gone to roost; then he scaled windows, leaped over garden walls,\nand was let in by Mrs. Betty in the dark. Nay, the magistrates of Bath\ncomplimented him with the freedom of the corporation, merely because,\nthrough his means, the waters had gained extraordinary credit; for every\nfemale of a tolerable appearance, that went thither on account of her\nsterility, got the better of her complaint, during his residence at\nBath. And now the fellow thinks no woman can withstand his addresses.\nHe had not been here three minutes, when I could perceive, with half\nan eye, that he had marked out your grace for a conquest,--I mean in\nan honourable way; though the rascal has impudence enough to attempt\nanything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he fixed his eyes upon the duchess, who, while her face\nglowed with indignation, turning to her confidant, expressed herself in\nthese words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon my life! I believe there is actually some truth in\nwhat this old ruffian says; I have myself observed that young fellow\neyeing me with a very particular stare.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not to be at all\nwondered at,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said her friend, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat a youth of his complexion should\nbe sensible to the charms of your grace! but I dare say he would\nnot presume to entertain any but the most honourable and respectful\nsentiments.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cRespectful sentiments!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried my lady, with a look of\nineffable disdain; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I thought the fellow had assurance enough to\nthink of me in any shape, I protest I would forbid him my house. Upon my\nhonour, such instances of audacity should induce persons of quality to\nkeep your small gentry at a greater distance; for they are very apt to\ngrow impudent, upon the least countenance or encouragement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCadwallader, satisfied with this declaration, changed the subject of\ndiscourse, and next day communicated his discovery to his friend Pickle,\nwho upon this occasion felt the most stinging sensations of mortified\npride, and resolved to quit his prospect with a good grace. Nor did the\nexecution of this self-denying scheme cost him one moment's uneasiness;\nfor his heart had never been interested in the pursuit, and his vanity\ntriumphed in the thoughts of manifesting his indifference. Accordingly,\nthe very next time he visited her grace, his behaviour was remarkably\nfrank, sprightly and disengaged; and the subject of love being\nartfully introduced by the widow, who had been directed to sound his\ninclinations, he rallied the passion with great ease and severity and\nmade no scruple of declaring himself heart-whole. Though the duchess\nhad resented his supposed affection, she was now offended at his\ninsensibility, and even signified her disgust, by observing, that\nperhaps his attention to his own qualifications screened him from the\nimpression of all other objects.\n\nWhile he enjoyed this sarcasm, the meaning of which he could plainly\ndiscern, the company was joined by a certain virtuoso, who had gained\nfree access to all the great families of the land, by his noble talent\nof gossiping and buffoonery. He was now in the seventy-fifth year of his\nage; his birth was so obscure, that he scarce knew his father's name;\nhis education suitable to the dignity of his descent; his character\npublicly branded with homicide, profligacy, and breach of trust; yet\nthis man, by the happy inheritance of impregnable effrontery, and a\nlucky prostitution of all principle in rendering himself subservient to\nthe appetites of the great, had attained to an independency of fortune,\nas well as to such a particular share of favour among the quality, that,\nalthough he was well known to have pimped for three generations of the\nnobility, there was not a lady of fashion in the kingdom who scrupled to\nadmit him to her toilette, or even to be squired by him in any place of\npublic entertainment. Not but that this sage was occasionally useful to\nhis fellow-creatures, by these connections with people of fortune; for\nhe often undertook to solicit charity in behalf of distressed objects,\nwith a view of embezzling one-half of the benefactions. It was an errand\nof this kind that now brought him to the house of her grace.\n\nAfter having sat a few minutes, he told the company that he would favour\nthem with a very proper opportunity to extend their benevolence, for the\nrelief of a poor gentlewoman, who was reduced to the most abject misery,\nby the death of her husband, and just delivered of a couple of fine\nboys: they, moreover, understood from his information, that this object\nwas daughter of a good family, who had renounced her in consequence\nof her marrying an ensign without a fortune; and even obstructed\nhis promotion with all their influence and power; a circumstance of\nbarbarity which had made such an impression upon his mind, as disordered\nhis brain, and drove him to despair, in a fit of which he had made away\nwith himself, leaving his wife, then big with child, to all the horrors\nof indigence and grief.\n\nVarious were the criticisms on this pathetic picture, which the old man\ndrew with great expression. My lady duchess concluded that she must be\na creature void of all feeling and reflection, who could survive such\naggravated misery, therefore did not deserve to be relieved, except in\nthe character of a common beggar; and was generous enough to offer a\nrecommendation, by which she would be admitted into an infirmary,\nto which her grace was a subscriber; at the same time advising the\nsolicitor to send the twins to the Foundling Hospital, where they could\nbe carefully nursed and brought up, so as to become useful members to\nthe commonwealth. Another lady, with all due deference to the opinion of\nthe duchess, was free enough to blame the generosity of her grace, which\nwould only serve to encourage children in disobedience to their parents,\nand might be the means not only of prolonging the distress of the\nwretched creature, but also of ruining the constitution of some young\nheir, perhaps the hope of a great family; for she did suppose that\nmadam, when her month should be up, and her brats disposed of, would\nspread her attractions to the public, provided she could profit by her\nperson, and, in the usual way, make a regular progress from St. James's\nto Drury Lane. She apprehended, for these reasons, that their compassion\nwould be most effectually shown, in leaving her to perish in her present\nnecessity; and that the old gentleman would be unpardonable, should\nhe persist in his endeavours to relieve her. A third member of this\ntender-hearted society, after having asked if the young woman was\nhandsome, and being answered in the negative, allowed that there was a\ngreat deal of reason in what had been said by the honourable person who\nhad spoke last; nevertheless, she humbly conceived her sentence would\nadmit of some mitigation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet the bantlings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe sent to the\nhospital, according to the advice of her grace, and a small collection\nbe made for the present support of the mother; and, when her health\nis recovered, I will take her into my family, in quality of an upper\nservant, or medium between me and my woman; for, upon my life! I can't\nendure to chide or give directions to a creature, who is, in point of\nbirth and education, but one degree above the vulgar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis proposal met with universal approbation. The duchess, to her\nimmortal honour, began the contribution with a crown; so that the rest\nof the company were obliged to restrict their liberality to half the\nsum, that her grace might not be affronted. And the proposer, demanding\nthe poor woman's name and place of abode, the old mediator could not\nhelp giving her ladyship a verbal direction, though he was extremely\nmortified, on more accounts than one, to find such an issue to his\nsolicitation.\n\nPeregrine, who, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthough humorous as winter, had a tear for pity, and\na hand open as day for melting charity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was shocked at the nature and\nresult of this ungenerous consultation. He contributed his half-crown,\nhowever, and, retiring from the company, betook himself to the lodgings\nof the forlorn lady in the straw, according to the direction he had\nheard. Upon inquiry, he understood that she was then visited by some\ncharitable gentlewoman, who had sent for a nurse, and waited the return\nof the messenger; and he sent up his respects, desiring he might be\npermitted to see her, on pretence of having been intimate with her late\nhusband.\n\nThough the poor woman had never heard of his name, she did not think\nproper to deny his request; and he was conducted to a paltry chamber\nin the third story, where he found this unhappy widow sitting upon a\ntruckle-bed, and suckling one of her infants, with the most piteous\nexpression of anguish in her features, which were naturally regular\nand sweet, while the other was fondled on the knee of a person, whose\nattention was so much engrossed by her little charge, that, for the\npresent, she could mind nothing else; and it was not till after the\nfirst compliments passed betwixt the hapless mother and our adventurer,\nthat he perceived the stranger's countenance, which inspired him with\nthe highest esteem and admiration. He beheld all the graces of elegance\nand beauty, breathing sentiment and beneficence, and softened into the\nmost enchanting tenderness of weeping sympathy. When he declared the\ncause of his visit, which was no other than the desire of befriending\nthe distressed lady, to whom he presented a bank-note for twenty pounds,\nhe was favoured with such a look of complacency by this amiable phantom,\nwho might have been justly taken for an angel ministering to the\nnecessities of mortals, that his whole soul was transported with love\nand veneration. Nor was this prepossession diminished by the information\nof the widow, who, after having manifested her gratitude in a flood of\ntears, told him, that the unknown object of his esteem was a person of\nhonour, who having heard by accident of her deplorable situation, had\nimmediately obeyed the dictates of her humanity, and come in person to\nrelieve her distress; that she had not only generously supplied her with\nmoney for present sustenance, but also undertaken to provide a nurse for\nher babes, and even promised to favour her with protection, should\nshe survive her present melancholy situation. To these articles of\nintelligence she added, that the name of her benefactress was the\ncelebrated Lady --, to whose character the youth was no stranger, though\nhe had never seen her person before. The killing edge of her charms was\na little blunted by the accidents of time and fortune; but no man of\ntaste and imagination, whose nerves were not quite chilled with the\nfrost of age, could, even at that time, look upon her with impunity.\nAnd as Peregrine saw her attractions heightened by the tender office in\nwhich she was engaged, he was smitten with her beauty, and so ravished\nwith her compassion, that he could not suppress his emotions, but\napplauded her benevolence with all the warmth of enthusiasm.\n\nHer ladyship received his compliments with great politeness and\naffability. And the occasion on which they met being equally interesting\nto both, an acquaintance commenced between them, and they concerted\nmeasures for the benefit of the widow and her two children, one of whom\nour hero bespoke for his own godson; for Pickle was not so obscure in\nthe beau monde, but that his fame had reached the ears of this lady,\nwho, therefore, did not discourage his advances towards her friendship\nand esteem. All the particulars relating to their charge being adjusted,\nhe attended her ladyship to her own house; and, by her conversation,\nhad the pleasure of finding her understanding suitable to her other\naccomplishments. Nor had she any reason to think that our hero's\nqualifications had been exaggerated by common report.\n\nOne of their adopted children died before it was baptized; so that\ntheir care concentred in the other, for whom they stood sponsors.\nUnderstanding that the old agent was becoming troublesome in his visits\nto the mother, to whom he now began to administer such counsel as\nshocked the delicacy of her virtue, they removed her into another\nlodging, where she would not be exposed to his machinations. In less\nthan a month, our hero learned from a nobleman of his acquaintance,\nthat the hoary pander had actually engaged to procure for him this\npoor afflicted gentlewoman; and, being frustrated in his intention,\nsubstituted in her room a nymph from the purlieus of Covent Garden, that\nmade his lordship smart severely for the favours she bestowed.\n\nMeanwhile, Peregrine cultivated his new acquaintance with all his art\nand assiduity, presuming, from the circumstances of her reputation and\nfate, as well as on the strength of his own merit, that, in time, he\nshould be able to indulge that passion which had begun to glow within\nhis breast. As her ladyship had undergone a vast variety of fortune\nand adventure, which he had heard indistinctly related, with numberless\nerrors and misrepresentations, he was no sooner entitled, by the\nfamiliarity of communication, to ask such a favour, than he earnestly\nentreated her to entertain him with the particulars of her story; and,\nby dint of importunity, she was at length prevailed upon, in a select\nparty, to gratify his curiosity, by the account given in the following\nchapter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXI.\n\n\n\nThe Memoirs of a Lady of Quality.\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the circumstances of the story which I am going to relate, you will\nbe convinced of my candour, while you are informed of my indiscretion.\nYou will be enabled, I hope, to perceive, that, howsoever my head may\nhave erred, my heart hath always been uncorrupted, and that I have been\nunhappy, because I loved, and was a woman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe I need not observe, that I was the only child of a man of\ngood fortune, who indulged me in my infancy with all the tenderness of\npaternal affection; and, when I was six years old, sent me to a private\nschool, where I stayed till my age was doubled, and became such a\nfavourite, that I was, even in those early days, carried to all the\nplaces of public diversion, the court itself not excepted, an indulgence\nthat flattered my love of pleasure, to which I was naturally addicted,\nand encouraged those ideas of vanity and ambition which spring up so\nearly in the human mind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was lively and good-natured, my imagination apt to run riot, my heart\nliberal and disinterested, though I was so obstinately attached to my\nown opinions, that I could not well brook contradiction; and, in the\nwhole of my disposition, resembled that of Henry V., as described by\nShakespeare.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn my thirteenth year I went to Bath, where I was first introduced\ninto the world as a woman, having been entitled to that privilege by my\nperson, which was remarkably tall for my years; and there my fancy was\nquite captivated by the variety of diversions in which I was continually\nengaged. Not that the parties were altogether new to me, but because I\nnow found myself considered as a person of consequence, and surrounded\nby a crowd of admirers, who courted my acquaintance, and fed my vanity\nwith praise and adulation. In short, whether or not I deserved their\nencomiums, I leave the world to judge; but my person was commended, and\nmy talent in dancing met with universal applause. No wonder, then,\nthat everything appeared joyous to a young creature, who was so void\nof experience and dissimulation, that she believed everybody's heart as\nsincere as her own, and every object such as it appeared to be.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmong the swains who sighed, or pretended to sigh for me, were two\nthat bore a pretty equal share of my favour (it was too superficial to\ndeserve the name of love). One of these was a forward youth of sixteen,\nextremely handsome, lively, and impudent. He attended in quality of page\nupon the Princess Amelia, who spent that season at Bath. The other was a\nScotch nobleman turned of thirty, who was graced with a red ribbon, and\ndanced particularly well, two qualifications of great weight with a\ngirl of my age, whose heart was not deeply interested in the cause.\nNevertheless, the page prevailed over this formidable rival; though our\namour went no farther than a little flirting, and ceased entirely when I\nleft the place.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNext year, however, I revisited this agreeable scene, and passed my\ntime in the same circle of amusements; in which, indeed, each season\nat Bath is exactly resembled by that which succeeds, allowing for the\ndifference of company, which is continually varying. There I met with\nthe same incense, and again had my favourite, who was a North Briton,\nand captain of foot, near forty years of age, and a little lame, an\nimpediment which I did not discover, until it was pointed out by some\nof my companions, who rallied me upon my choice. He was always\ncheerful, and very amorous, had a good countenance, and an excellent\nunderstanding, possessed a great deal of art, and would have persuaded\nme to marry him, had I not been restrained by the authority of my\nfather, whose consent was not to be obtained in favour of a man of his\nfortune.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt the same time, many proposals of marriage were made to my parents;\nbut as they came from people whom I did not like, I rejected them all,\nbeing determined to refuse every man who did not make his addresses to\nmyself in person, because I had no notion of marrying for anything\nbut love. Among these formal proposers was a Scottish earl, whose\npretensions were broke off by some difference about settlements; and\nthe son of an English baron, with whom my father was in treaty, when\nhe carried me to town, on a visit to a young lady with whom I had been\nintimate from my infancy. She was just delivered of her first son, for\nwhom we stood sponsors; so that this occasion detained us a whole month,\nduring which I went to a ball at court, on the Queen's birthday, and\nthere, for the first time, felt what love and beauty were.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe second son of Duke H--, who had just returned from his travels, was\ndancing with the princess royal, when a young lady came and desired\nme to go and see a stranger, whom all the world admired. Upon which I\nfollowed her into the circle, and observed this object of admiration. He\nwas dressed in a coat of white cloth, faced with blue satin, embroidered\nwith silver, of the same piece with his waistcoat; his fine hair hung\ndown his back in ringlets below his waist; his hat was laced with\nsilver, and garnished with a white feather; but his person beggared\ndescription. He was tall and graceful, neither corpulent nor meagre, his\nlimbs finely proportioned, his countenance open and majestic, his eyes\nfull of sweetness and vivacity, his teeth regular, and his pouting lips\nof the complexion of the damask rose. In short, he was formed for\nlove, and inspired it wherever he appeared; nor was he a niggard of his\ntalents, but liberally returned it, at least, what passed for such; for\nhe had a flow of gallantry, for which many ladies of this land can vouch\nfrom their own experience. But he exclaimed against marriage, because\nhe had, as yet, met with no woman to whose charms he would surrender his\nliberty, though a princess of France, and lady of the same rank in --,\nwere said to be, at that time, enamoured of his person.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI went home, totally engrossed by his idea, flattering myself that he\nhad observed me with some attention; for I was young and new, and had\nthe good fortune to attract the notice and approbation of the queen\nherself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNext day, being at the opera, I was agreeably surprised with the\nappearance of this amiable stranger, who no sooner saw me enter, than\nhe approached so near to the place where I sat, that I overheard what he\nsaid to his companions; and was so happy as to find myself the object\nof his discourse, which abounded with rapturous expressions of love and\nadmiration. I could not listen to these transports without emotion; my\ncolour changed, my heart throbbed with unusual violence, and my eyes\nbetrayed my inclination in sundry favourable glances, which he seemed to\ninterpret aright, though he could not then avail himself of his success,\nso far as to communicate his sentiments by speech, because we were\nstrangers to each other.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI passed that night in the most anxious suspense, and several days\nelapsed before I saw him again. At length, however, being at court on\na ball-night, and determined against dancing, I perceived him among the\ncrowd, and, to my unspeakable joy, saw him advance, with my Lord P--,\nwho introduced him to my acquaintance. He soon found means to alter my\nresolution, and I condescended to be his partner all the evening; during\nwhich he declared his passion in the most tender and persuasive terms\nthat real love could dictate, or fruitful imagination invent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believed his protestations, because I wished them true, and was an\nunexperienced girl of fifteen. I complied with his earnest request of\nbeing permitted to visit me, and even invited him to breakfast next\nmorning; so that you may imagine (I speak to those that feel) I did\nnot, that night, enjoy much repose. Such was the hurry and flutter of my\nspirits, that I rose at six to receive him at ten. I dressed myself in\na new pink satin gown, and my best laced night-clothes, and was so\nanimated by the occasion that, if ever I deserved a compliment upon my\nlooks, it was my due at this meeting. The wished-for moment came that\nbrought my lover to my view. I was overwhelmed with joy, modesty, and\nfear of I knew not what. We sat down to breakfast, but did not eat. He\nrenewed his addresses with irresistible eloquence, and pressed me to\naccept of his hand without further hesitation. But to such a precipitate\nstep I objected, as a measure repugnant to my decency, as well as to\nthat duty which I owed to my father, whom I tenderly loved.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThough I withstood this premature proposal, I did not attempt to\ndisguise the situation of my thoughts; and thus commenced a tender\ncorrespondence, which was maintained by letters while I remained in the\ncountry, and carried on, when I was in town, by private interviews twice\nor thrice a week at the house of my milliner, where such endearments\npassed as refined and happy lovers know, and others can only guess.\nTruth and innocence prevailed on my side, while his heart was fraught\nwith sincerity and love. Such frequent intercourse created an intimacy\nwhich I began to think dangerous, and therefore yielded to his repeated\ndesire that we might be united for ever. Nay, I resolved to avoid him,\nuntil the day should be fixed, and very innocently, though not very\nwisely, told him my reason for this determination, which was no other\nthan a consciousness of my incapacity to refuse him anything he should\ndemand as a testimony of my love.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe time was accordingly appointed, at the distance of a few days,\nduring which I intended to have implored my father's consent, though I\nhad but faint hopes of obtaining it. But he was by some means or other\napprised of our design, before I could prevail upon myself to make him\nacquainted with our purpose. I had danced with my lover at the ridotto\non the preceding evening, and there perhaps our eyes betrayed us.\nCertain it is, several of Lord W--'s relations, who disapproved of the\nmatch, came up and rallied him on his passion; Lord S--k, in particular,\nused this remarkable expression, 'Nephew, as much love as you please,\nbut no matrimony.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNext day, the priest being prepared, and the bridegroom waiting for me\nat the appointed place, in all the transports of impatient expectation,\nI was, without any previous warning, carried into the country by my\nfather, who took no notice of the intelligence he had received, but\ndecoyed me into the coach on pretence of taking the air; and, when we\nhad proceeded as far as Turnham Green, gave me to understand, that he\nwould dine in that place.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was no remedy. I was obliged to bear my disappointment, though\nwith an aching heart, and followed him up-stairs into an apartment,\nwhere he told me he was minutely informed of my matrimonial scheme. I\ndid not attempt to disguise the truth, but assured him, while the tears\ngushed from my eyes, that my want of courage alone had hindered me from\nmaking him privy to my passion; though I owned, I should have married\nLord W--, even though he had disapproved of my choice. I reminded him of\nthe uneasy life I led at home, and frankly acknowledged, that I loved my\nadmirer too well to live without him; though, if he would favour me with\nhis consent, I would defer my intention, and punctually observe any day\nhe would fix for our nuptials. Meanwhile I begged he would permit me to\nsend a message to Lord W--, who was waiting in expectation of my coming,\nand might, without such notice, imagine I was playing the jilt. He\ngranted this last request; in consequence of which I sent a letter to\nmy lover, who, when he received it, had almost fainted away, believing I\nshould be locked up in the country, and snatched for ever from his arms.\nTortured with these apprehensions, he changed clothes immediately, and,\ntaking horse, resolved to follow me whithersoever we should go.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter dinner, we proceeded as far as Brentford, where we lay, intending\nto be at my father's country house next night; and my admirer putting up\nat the same inn, practised every expedient his invention could suggest\nto procure an interview; but all his endeavours were unsuccessful,\nbecause I, who little dreamed of his being so near, had gone to bed upon\nour first arrival, overwhelmed with affliction and tears. In the morning\nI threw myself at my father's feet, and conjured him, by all the ties\nof paternal affection, to indulge me with an opportunity of seeing my\nadmirer once more, before I should be conveyed from his wishes. The\nmelancholy condition in which I preferred this supplication, melted the\ntender heart of my parent, who yielded to my supplications, and carried\nme back to town for that purpose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord W--, who had watched our motions, and arrived at his own lodgings\nbefore we arrived at my father's house, obeyed my summons on the\ninstant, and appeared before me like an angel. Our faculties were for\nsome minutes suspended by a conflict of grief and joy. At length I\nrecovered the use of speech, and gave him to understand, that I was\ncome to town in order to take my leave of him, by the permission of my\nfather, whom I had promised to attend into the country next day, before\nhe would consent to my return; the chief cause and pretence of which\nwas my earnest desire to convince him, that I was not to blame for the\ndisappointment he had suffered, and that I should see him again in a\nmonth, when the nuptial knot should be tied in spite of all opposition.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lover, who was better acquainted with the world, had wellnigh run\ndistracted with this information. He swore he would not leave me, until\nI should promise to meet and marry him next day; or, if I refused to\ngrant that request, he would immediately leave the kingdom, to which he\nwould never more return; and, before his departure, sacrifice Lord H.\nB--, son to the Duke of S. A--, who was the only person upon earth who\ncould have betrayed us to my father, because he alone was trusted with\nthe secret of our intended marriage, and had actually undertaken to give\nme away; an office which he afterwards declined. Lord W-- also affirmed,\nthat my father decoyed me into the country with a view of cooping me up,\nand sequestering me entirely from his view and correspondence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn vain I pleaded my father's well-known tenderness, and used all the\narguments I could recollect to divert him from his revenge upon Lord\nH--. He was deaf to all my representations, and nothing, I found, would\nprevail upon him to suppress his resentment, but a positive promise to\ncomply with his former desire. I told him I would hazard everything to\nmake him happy; but could not, with any regard to my duty, take such a\nstep without the knowledge of my parent; or, if I were so inclined, it\nwould be impracticable to elude his vigilance and suspicion. However,\nhe employed such pathetic remonstrances, and retained such a powerful\nadvocate within my own breast, that, before we parted, I assured him my\nwhole power should be exerted for his satisfaction; and he signified his\nresolution of sitting up all night, in expectation of seeing me at his\nlodgings.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe had no sooner retired, than I went into the next room, and\ndesired my father to fix a day for the marriage; in which case I would\ncheerfully wait upon him into the country; whereas, should he deny\nmy request, on pretence of staying for the consent of my mother's\nrelations, which was very uncertain, I would seize the first opportunity\nof marrying Lord W--, cost what it would. He consented to the match,\nbut would not appoint a day for the ceremony, which he proposed to defer\nuntil all parties should be agreed; and such a favourable crisis, I\nfeared, would never happen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI therefore resolved within myself to gratify my lover's expectation,\nby eloping, if possible, that very night; though the execution of this\nplan was extremely difficult, because my father was upon the alarm,\nand my own maid, who was my bedfellow, altogether in his interest.\nNotwithstanding these considerations, I found means to engage one of\nthe housemaids in my behalf, who bespoke a hackney-coach, to be kept in\nwaiting all night; and to bed I went with my Abigail, whom, as I had not\nclosed an eye, I waked about five in the morning, and sent to pack up\nsome things for our intended journey.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile she was thus employed, I got up, and huddled on my clothes,\nstanding upon my pillow, lest my father, who lay in the chamber below,\nshould hear me afoot, and suspect my design. Having dressed myself with\ngreat despatch and disorder, I flounced downstairs, stalking as heavily\nas I could tread, that he might mistake me for one of the servants; and\nmy confederate opening the door, I sallied out into the street, though\nI knew not which way to turn; and, to my unspeakable mortification,\nneither coach nor chair appeared.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving travelled on foot a good way, in hope of finding a convenience,\nand being not only disappointed in that particular, but also bewildered\nin my peregrination, I began to be exceedingly alarmed with the\napprehension of being met by some person who might know me; because in\nthat case, my design would undoubtedly have been discovered, from every\ncircumstance of my appearance at that time of day; for I had put on\nthe very clothes which I had pulled off overnight, so that my dress was\naltogether odd and peculiar. My shoes were very fine, and over a large\nhoop I wore a pink satin quilted petticoat trimmed with silver, which\nwas partly covered by a white dimity night-gown, a full quarter of\na yard too short; my handkerchief and apron were hurried on without\npinning; my nightcap could not contain my hair, which hung about my\nears in great disorder; and my countenance denoted a mixture of hope and\nfear, joy and shame.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this dilemma, I made my addresses to that honourable member of\nsociety, a shoe-black, whom I earnestly entreated to provide me with a\ncoach or chair, promising to reward him liberally for his trouble, but\nhe, having the misfortune to be lame, was unable to keep up with\nmy pace; so that by his advice and direction, I went into the first\npublic-house I found open, where I stayed some time, in the utmost\nconsternation, among a crew of wretches whom I thought proper to bribe\nfor their civility, not without the terror of being stripped. At length,\nhowever, my messenger returned with a chair, of which I took immediate\npossession; and fearing that, by this time, my family would be alarmed,\nand send directly to Lord W--'s lodgings, I ordered myself to be carried\nthither backwards, that so I might pass undiscovered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis stratagem succeeded according to my wish; I ran upstairs, in a\nstate of trepidation, to my faithful lover, who waited for me with the\nmost impatient and fearful suspense. At sight of me his eyes lightened\nwith transport: he caught me in his arms, as the richest present Heaven\ncould bestow; gave me to understand that my father had already sent to\nhis lodgings in quest of me; then applauding my love and resolution in\nthe most rapturous terms, he ordered a hackney-coach to be called, and,\nthat we might run no risk of separation, attended me to church, where we\nwere lawfully joined in the sight of Heaven.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis fears were then all over, but mine recurred with double\naggravation: I dreaded the sight of my father, and shared all the sorrow\nhe suffered on account of my undutiful behaviour; for I loved him with\nsuch piety of affection, that I would have endured every other species\nof distress, rather than given him the least uneasiness; but love, where\nhe reigns in full empire, is altogether irresistible, surmounts every\ndifficulty, and swallows up all other considerations. This was the case\nwith me; and now the irrevocable step was taken, my first care was to\navoid his sight. With this view, I begged that Lord W-- would think\nof some remote place in the country, to which we might retire for the\npresent, and he forthwith conducted me to a house on Blackheath, where\nwe were very civilly received by a laughter-loving dame, who seemed\nto mistake me for one of her own sisterhood. I no sooner perceived her\nopinion, than I desired Lord W-- to undeceive her; upon which she was\nmade acquainted with the nature of my situation, and showed us into a\nprivate room, where I called for pen and paper, and wrote an apology\nto my father, for having acted contrary to his will in so important a\nconcern.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis task being performed, the bridegroom gave me to understand, that\nthere was a necessity for our being bedded immediately, in order to\nrender the marriage binding, lest my father should discover and part\nus before consummation. I pleaded hard for a respite till the evening,\nobjecting to the indecency of going to bed before noon; but he found\nmeans to invalidate all my arguments, and to convince me that it was now\nmy duty to obey. Rather than hazard the imputation of being obstinate\nand refractory on the first day of my probation, I suffered myself to be\nled into a chamber, which was darkened by my express stipulation, that\nmy shame and confusion might be the better concealed, and yielded to the\nprivilege of a dear husband, who loved me to adoration.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout five o'clock in the afternoon we were called to dinner, which we\nhad ordered to be ready at four; but such a paltry care had been forgot\namidst the transports of our mutual bliss. We got up, however, and when\nwe came downstairs, I was ashamed to see the light of day, or meet the\neyes of my beloved lord. I ate little, said less, was happy, though\noverwhelmed with confusion, underwent a thousand agitations, some of\nwhich were painful, but by far the greater part belonged to rapture and\ndelight; we were imparadised in the gratification of our mutual wishes,\nand felt all that love can bestow, and sensibility enjoy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the twilight we returned to Lord W--'s lodgings in town, where I\nreceived a letter from my father, importing that he would never see me\nagain. But there was one circumstance in his manner of writing, from\nwhich I conceived a happy presage of his future indulgence. He had\nbegun with his usual appellation of 'Dear Fanny,' which, though it was\nexpunged to make way for the word 'Madam,' encouraged me to hope that\nhis paternal fondness was not yet extinguished.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt supper we were visited by Lord W--'s younger sister, who laughed\nat us for our inconsiderate match, though she owned she envied our\nhappiness, and offered me the use of her clothes until I could retrieve\nmy own. She was a woman of a great deal of humour, plain but genteel,\ncivil, friendly, and perfectly well bred. She favoured us with her\ncompany till the night was pretty far advanced, and did not take her\nleave till we retired to our apartment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs our lodgings were not spacious or magnificent, we resolved to see\nlittle company; but this resolution was frustrated by the numerous\nacquaintance of Lord W--, who let in half the town: so that I ran the\ngauntlet for a whole week among a set of wits, who always delight in\nteasing a young creature of any note, when she happens to make such\na stolen match. Among those that visited us upon this occasion was my\nlord's younger brother, who was at that time in keeping with a rich\nheiress of masculine memory, and took that opportunity of making\na parade with his equipage, which was indeed very magnificent, but\naltogether disregarded by us, whose happiness consisted in the opulence\nof mutual love.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis ceremony of receiving visits being performed, we went to wait on\nhis mother, the duchess of H--, who, hearing I was an heiress, readily\nforgave her son for marrying without her knowledge and consent, and\nfavoured us with a very cordial reception; insomuch, that for several\nmonths, we dined almost constantly at her table; and I must own, I\nalways found her unaltered in her civility and affection, contrary\nto her general character, which was haughty and capricious. She was\nundoubtedly a woman of great spirit and understanding, but subject to\nan infirmity which very much impairs and disguises every other\nqualification.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn about three weeks after our marriage, I was so happy as to obtain\nthe forgiveness of my father, to whose house we repaired, in order\nto pay our respects and submission. At sight of me he wept; nor did I\nbehold his tears unmoved. My heart was overcharged with tenderness and\nsorrow, for having offended such an indulgent parent; so that I mingled\nmy tears with his, while my dear husband, whose soul was of the softest\nand gentlest mould, melted with sympathy at the affecting scene. Being\nthus reconciled to my father, we attended him into the country, where\nwe were received by my mother, who was a sensible good woman, though\nnot susceptible to love, and therefore less apt to excuse a weakness\nto which she was an utter stranger. This was likewise the case with an\nuncle, from whom I had great expectations. He was a plain good-natured\nman, and treated us with great courtesy, though his notions, in point\nof love, were not exactly conformable to ours. Nevertheless, I was,\nand seemed to be so happy in my choice, that my family not only became\nsatisfied with the match, but exceedingly fond of Lord W--.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter a short stay with them in the country, we returned to London, in\norder to be introduced at court, and then set out for the north, on a\nvisit to my brother-in-law the duke of H--, who had, by a letter to Lord\nW--, invited us to his habitation. My father accordingly equipped us\nwith horses and money; for our own finances were extremely slender,\nconsisting only of a small pension, allowed by his grace, upon whom\nthe brothers were entirely dependent, the father having died suddenly,\nbefore suitable provision could be made for his younger children.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I took leave of my relations, bidding adieu to my paternal home,\nand found myself launching into a world of care and trouble, though the\nvoyage on which I embarked was altogether voluntary, and my companion\nthe person on whom I doted to distraction,--I could not help feeling\nsome melancholy sensations, which, however, in a little time, gave way\nto a train of more agreeable ideas. I was visited in town by almost\nall the women of fashion, many of whom, I perceived, envied me the\npossession of a man who had made strange havoc among their hearts, and\nsome of them knew the value of his favour. One in particular endeavoured\nto cultivate my friendship with singular marks of regard; but I thought\nproper to discourage her advances, by keeping within the bounds of bare\ncivility; and, indeed, to none of them was I lavish of my complaisance;\nfor I dedicated my whole time to the object of my affection, who\nengrossed my wishes to such a degree, that, although I was never\njealous, because I had no reason to be so, I envied the happiness of\nevery woman whom he chanced at any time to hand into a coach.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe duchess of --, who was newly married to the earl of P--, a\nparticular friend of Lord W--'s, carried me to court, and presented\nme to the queen, who expressed her approbation of my person in very\nparticular terms, and, observing the satisfaction that appeared in\nmy countenance, with marks of admiration, desired her ladies to take\nnotice, how little happiness depended upon wealth, since there was more\njoy in my face than in all her court besides.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSuch a declaration could not fail to overwhelm me with blushes, which\nher Majesty seemed to behold with pleasure; for she frequently repeated\nthe remark, and showed me to all the foreigners of distinction, with\nmany gracious expressions of favour. She wished Lord W-- happiness\ninstead of joy, and was pleased to promise, that she would provide for\nher pretty beggars. And poor enough we certainly were in every article\nbut love. Nevertheless, we felt no necessities, but passed the summer\nin a variety of pleasures and parties; the greatest part of which were\nplanned by Lord W--'s sister and another lady, who was at that time\nmistress to the prime minister. The first was a wit, but homely in\nperson; the other a woman of great beauty and masculine understanding;\nand a particular friendship subsisted between them, though they were\nboth lovers of power and admiration.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis lady, who sat at the helm, was extremely elegant, as well\nas expensive in her diversions, in many of which we bore a share,\nparticularly in her parties upon the water, which were contrived in all\nthe magnificence of taste. In the course of these amusements, a trifling\ncircumstance occurred, which I shall relate as an instance of that\njealous sensibility which characterised Lord W--'s disposition. A large\ncompany of ladies and gentlemen having agreed to dine at Vauxhall, and\nsup at Marble-hall, where we proposed to conclude the evening with a\ndance, one barge being insufficient to contain the whole company, we\nwere divided by lots; in consequence of which, my husband and I were\nparted. This separation was equally mortifying to us both, who, though\nmarried, were still lovers; and my chagrin increased when I perceived\nthat I was doomed to sit by Sir W. Y--, a man of professed gallantry;\nfor, although Lord W-- had, before his marriage, made his addresses to\nevery woman he saw, I knew very well he did not desire that any person\nshould make love to his wife.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat I might not, therefore, give umbrage, by talking to this gallant,\nI conversed with a Scotch nobleman, who, according to common report, had\nformerly sighed among my admirers. By these means, in seeking to avoid\none error, I unwittingly plunged myself into a greater, and disobliged\nLord W-- so much, that he could not conceal his displeasure; nay, so\ndeeply was he offended at my conduct, that, in the evening, when the\nball began, he would scarce deign to take me by the hand in the course\nof dancing, and darted such unkind looks, as pierced me to the very\nsoul. What augmented my concern, was my ignorance of the trespass I had\ncommitted. I was tortured with a thousand uneasy reflections; I began to\nfear that I had mistaken his temper, and given my heart to a man who was\ntired of possession; though I resolved to bear without complaining the\nmisfortune I had entailed upon myself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI seized the first opportunity of speaking to him, and thereby\ndiscovered the cause of his chagrin; but, as there was no time for\nexpostulation, the misunderstanding continued on his side, with such\nevident marks of uneasiness, that every individual of the company made\nup to me, and inquired about the cause of his disorder; so that I was\nfain to amuse their concern, by saying, that he had been ill the day\nbefore, and dancing did not agree with his constitution. So much was he\nincensed by this unhappy circumstance of my conduct, which was void of\nall intention to offend him, that he determined to be revenged on me\nfor my indiscretion, and at supper, chancing to sit between two very\nhandsome ladies, one of whom is lately dead, and the other, at present,\nmy neighbour in the country, he affected an air of gaiety, and openly\ncoquetted with them both.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis was not the only punishment he inflicted on his innocent wife. In\nthe course of our entertainment, we engaged in some simple diversion,\nin consequence of which the gentlemen were ordered to salute the ladies;\nwhen Lord W--, in performing this command, unkindly neglected me in my\nturn; I had occasion for all my discretion and pride, to conceal\nfrom the company the agonies I felt at this mark of indifference and\ndisrespect. However, I obtained the victory over myself, and pretended\nto laugh at his husband-like behaviour, while the tears stood in my eyes\nand my heart swelled even to bursting.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe broke up about five, after having spent the most tedious evening I\nhad ever known; and this offended lover went to bed in a state of sullen\nsilence and disgust. Whatever desire I had to come to an explanation, I\nthought myself so much aggrieved by his unreasonable prejudice, that\nI could not prevail upon myself to demand a conference, till after his\nfirst nap, when my pride giving way to my tenderness, I clasped him in\nmy arms, though he pretended to discourage these advances of my love. I\nasked how he could be so unjust as to take umbrage at my civility to\na man whom he knew I had refused for his sake; I chid him for his\nbarbarous endeavours to awake my jealousy, and used such irresistible\narguments in my own vindication, that he was convinced of my innocence,\nscaled my acquittal with a kind embrace, and we mutually enjoyed the\nsoft transports of a fond reconciliation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever was passion more eager, delicate, or unreserved, than that which\nglowed within our breasts. Far from being cloyed with the possession of\neach other, our raptures seemed to increase with the term of our union.\nWhen we were separated, though but for a few hours, by the necessary\navocations of life, we were unhappy during that brief separation, and\nmet again like lovers, who knew no joy but in one another's presence.\nHow many delicious evenings did we spend together, in our little\napartment, after we had ordered the candles to be taken away, that we\nmight enjoy the agreeable reflection of the moon in a fine summer's\nevening! Such a mild and solemn scene naturally disposes the mind to\npeace and benevolence; but when improved with conversation of the man\none loves, it fills the imagination with ideas of ineffable delight! For\nmy own part, I can safely say, my heart was so wholly engrossed by my\nhusband, that I never took pleasure in any diversion where he was not\npersonally concerned; nor was I ever guilty of one thought repugnant to\nmy duty and my love.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the autumn, we set out for the north, and were met on the road by\nthe duke and twenty gentlemen, who conducted us to H--n, where we lived\nin all imaginable splendour. His grace, at that time, maintained above\na hundred servants, with a band of music, which always performed at\ndinner, kept open table, and was visited by a great deal of company. The\neconomy of his house was superintended by his eldest sister, a beautiful\nyoung lady of an amiable temper, with whom I soon contracted an intimate\nfriendship. She and the duke used to rally me upon my fondness for Lord\nW--, who was a sort of humourist, and apt to be in a pet, in which\ncase he would leave the company and go to bed by seven o'clock in the\nevening. On these occasions, I always disappeared, giving up every\nconsideration to that of pleasing my husband, notwithstanding the\nridicule of his relations, who taxed me with having spoiled him with\ntoo much indulgence. But how could I express too much tenderness and\ncondescension for a man, who doted upon me to such excess, that,\nwhen business obliged him to leave me, he always snatched the first\nopportunity to return, and often rode through darkness, storms, and\ntempests to my arms?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving stayed about seven months in this place, I found myself in a\nfair way of being a mother, and that I might be near my own relations\nin such an interesting situation, I and my dear companion departed\nfrom H--n, not without great reluctance; for I was fond of the Scots in\ngeneral, who treated me with great hospitality and respect; and to this\nday, they paid me the compliment of saying, I was one of the best wives\nin that country which is so justly celebrated for good women.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord W-- having attended me to my father's house, was obliged to\nreturn to Scotland, to support his interest in being elected member of\nParliament; so that he took his leave of me, with a full resolution of\nseeing me again before the time of my lying-in; and all the comfort\nI enjoyed in his absence, was the perusal of his letters, which I\npunctually received, together with those of his sister, who, from time\nto time, favoured me with assurances of his constancy and devotion.\nIndeed, these testimonials were necessary to one of my disposition; for\nI was none of those who could be contented with half a heart. I could\nnot even spare one complacent look to any other woman, but expected\nthe undivided homage of his love. Had I been disappointed in this\nexpectation, I should, though a wife, have rebelled or died.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMeanwhile my parents treated me with great tenderness, intending that\nLord W-- should be settled in a house of his own, and accommodated with\nmy fortune, and his expectations from the queen were very sanguine, when\nI was taken ill, and delivered of a dead child, an event which affected\nme extremely. When I understood the extent of my misfortune, my heart\nthrobbed with such violence, that my breast could scarce contain it;\nand my anxiety, being aggravated by the absence of my lord, produced a\ndangerous fever, of which he was no sooner apprised by letter, than he\ncame post from Scotland; but, before his arrival, I was supposed to be\nin a fair way.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDuring this journey, he was tortured with all that terrible suspense\nwhich prevails in the minds of those who are in danger of losing that\nwhich is most dear to them; and, when he entered the house, was so much\noverwhelmed with apprehension, that he durst not inquire about the state\nof my health. As for my part, I never closed an eye from the time on\nwhich I expected his return; and, when I heard his voice, I threw open\nmy curtains, and sat up in the bed to receive him, though at the hazard\nof my life. He ran towards me with all the eagerness of passion, and\nclasped me in his arms; he kneeled by the bedside, and kissed my hand\na thousand times, and wept with transports of tenderness and joy.\nIn short, this meeting was so pathetic as to overcome my enfeebled\nconstitution, and we were parted by those who were wiser than ourselves,\nand saw that nothing was so proper for us as a little repose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut how shall I relate the deplorable transition from envied happiness\nto excess of misery which I now sustained! My month was hardly up, when\nmy dear husband was taken ill; perhaps the fatigue of body, as well as\nmind, which he had undergone on my account, occasioned a fatal ferment\nin his blood, and his health fell a sacrifice to his love. Physicians\nwere called from London, but alas! they brought no hopes of his\nrecovery. By their advice, he was removed to town, for the convenience\nof being punctually attended. Every moment was too precious to be thrown\naway; he was therefore immediately put into the coach, though the day\nwas far spent; and I, though exceedingly weak, accompanied him in the\njourney, which was performed by the light of flambeaus, and rendered\nunspeakingly shocking by the dismal apprehension of losing him every\nmoment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt length, however, we arrived at our lodgings in Pall Mall, where I\nlay by him on the floor, and attended the issue of his distemper in all\nthe agonies of horror and despair. In a little time his malady\nsettled upon his brain, and, in his delirium, he uttered such dreadful\nexclamations, as were sufficient to pierce the most savage heart. What\neffect then must they have had on mine, which was fraught with every\nsentiment of the most melting affection! It was not a common grief that\ntook possession of my soul; I felt all the aggravation of the most acute\ndistress. I sometimes ran down the street in a fit of distraction: I\nsent for the doctors every minute: I wearied Heaven with my prayers;\neven now my heart aches at the remembrance of what I suffered, and I\ncannot, without trembling, proceed with the woeful story.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter having lain insensible some days, he recovered the use of speech,\nand called upon my name, which he had a thousand times repeated while he\nwas bereft of reason. All hopes of his life were now relinquished, and\nI was led to his bedside to receive his last adieus, being directed to\nsummon all my fortitude, and suppress my sorrow, that he might not be\ndisturbed by my agitation. I collected all my resolution to support me\nin this affecting scene. I saw my dear lord in extremity. The beauties\nof his youth were all decayed; yet his eyes, though languid, retained\nunspeakable sweetness and expression. He felt his end approaching, put\nforth his hand, and, with a look full of complacency and benevolence,\nuttered such a tender tale--good Heaven! how had I deserved such\naccumulated affliction, the bare remembrance of which now melts me into\ntears? Human nature could not undergo my situation without suffering an\necstasy of grief. I clasped him in my arms, and kissed him a thousand\ntimes, with the most violent emotions of woe; but I was torn from his\nembrace, and in a little time he was ravished for ever from my view.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn that fatal morning, which put a period to his life, I saw the\nduchess of L-- approach my bed, and, from her appearance, concluded that\nhe was no more; yet I begged she would not confirm the unhappy presage\nby announcing his death; and she accordingly preserved the most emphatic\nsilence. I got up, and trod softly over his head, as if I had been\nafraid of interrupting his repose. Alas! he was no longer sensible of\nsuch disturbance. I was seized with a stupefaction of sorrow; I threw\nup the window and, looking around, thought the sun shone with the most\ndismal aspect; everything was solitary, cheerless, and replete with\nhorror.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this condition I was, by the direction of my friend, conveyed to\nher house, where my faculties were so overpowered by the load of anguish\nwhich oppressed me, that I know not what passed during the first days of\nmy unhappy widowhood; this only I know, the kind duchess treated me with\nall imaginable care and compassion, and carried me to her country house,\nwhere I stayed some months; during which, she endeavoured to comfort\nme with all the amusements she could invent, and laid me under\nsuch obligations as shall never be erased from my remembrance. Yet,\nnotwithstanding all her care and concern, I was, by my excess of grief,\nplunged into a languishing distemper, for which my physicians advised me\nto drink the Bath waters.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn compliance with this prescription, I went thither towards the end of\nsummer, and found some benefit by adhering to their directions. Though\nI seldom went abroad, except when I visited my sister-in-law, who was\nthere with the princess; and, upon these occasions, I never failed to\nattract the notice of the company, who were struck with the appearance\nof such a young creature in weeds. Nor was I free from the persecution\nof professed admirers; but, being dead to all joy, I was deaf to the\nvoice of adulation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout Christmas I repaired to my father's house, where my sorrows were\nrevived by every object that recalled the idea of my dear lamented lord.\nBut these melancholy reflections I was obliged to bear, because I had\nno other home or habitation, being left an unprovided widow, altogether\ndependent on the affection of my own family. During this winter, divers\novertures were made to my father by people who demanded me in marriage;\nbut my heart was not yet sufficiently weaned from my former passion to\nadmit the thoughts of another master. Among those that presented their\nproposals was a certain young nobleman, who, upon the first news of Lord\nW--'s death, came post from Paris, in order to declare his passion. He\nmade his first appearance in a hired chariot-and-six, accompanied by a\nbig fat fellow, whom (as I afterwards learned) he had engaged to sound\nhis praises, with a promise of a thousand pounds, in lieu of which he\npaid him forty. Whether it was with a view of screening himself from the\ncold, or of making a comfortable medium in case of being overturned, and\nfalling under his weighty companion, I know not; but, certain it is, the\ncarriage was stuffed with hay, in such a manner, that, when he arrived,\nthe servants were at some pains in rummaging and removing it, before\nthey could come at their master, or help him to alight. When he was\nlifted out of the chariot, he exhibited a very ludicrous figure to the\nview. He was a thin, meagre, shivering creature, of a low stature, with\nlittle black eyes, a long nose, sallow complexion, and pitted with\nthe smallpox; dressed in a coat of light brown frieze, lined with\npink-coloured shag, a monstrous solitaire and bag, and, if I remember\nright, a pair of huge jack-boots. In a word, his whole appearance was\nso little calculated for inspiring love, that I had, on the strength of\nseeing him once before at Oxford, set him down as the last man on earth\nwhom I would choose to wed; and I will venture to affirm, that he was in\nevery particular the reverse of my late husband.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs my father was not at home, he stayed but one evening, and left his\nerrand with my mother, to whom he was as disagreeable as to myself; so\nthat his proposal was absolutely rejected, and I heard no more of him\nduring the space of three whole months, at the expiration of which I\nwent to town, where this mortifying figure presented itself again, and\nrenewed his suit, offering such advantageous terms of settlement, that\nmy father began to relish the match, and warmly recommended it to my\nconsideration.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord W--'s relations advised me to embrace the opportunity of making\nmyself independent. All my acquaintance plied me with arguments to the\nsame purpose. I was uneasy at home, and indifferent to all mankind. I\nweighed the motives with the objections, and with reluctance yielded to\nthe importunity of my friends. In consequence of this determination,\nthe little gentleman was permitted to visit me; and the manner of his\naddress did not alter the opinion I had conceived of his character and\nunderstanding. I was even shocked at the prospect of marrying a man whom\nI could not love; and, in order to disburden my own conscience, took\nan opportunity of telling him, one evening, as we sat opposite to\neach other, that it was not in my power to command my affection, and\ntherefore he could not expect the possession of my heart, Lord W--'s\nindulgence having spoiled me for a wife; nevertheless, I would endeavour\nto contract a friendship for him, which would entirely depend upon his\nown behaviour.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo this declaration he replied, to my great surprise, that he did\nnot desire me to love him; my friendship was sufficient; and next\nday repeated this strange instance of moderation in a letter, which I\ncommunicated to my sister, who laughed heartily at the contents, and\npersuaded me, that since I could love no man, he was the properest\nperson to be my husband.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAccordingly, the wedding clothes and equipage being prepared, the\nday--the fatal day--was fixed; on the morning of which I went to the\nhouse of my brother-in-law, duke H--, who loved me tenderly, and took my\nleave of the family, a family which I shall always remember with love,\nhonour, and esteem. His grace received me in the most affectionate\nmanner, saying at parting, 'Lady W--, if he does not use you well, I\nwill take you back again.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe bridegroom and I met at Ox-- Chapel, where the ceremony was\nperformed by the bishop of W--, in presence of his lordship's mother, my\nfather, and another lady. The nuptial knot being tied, we set out for\nmy father's house in the country, and proceeded full twenty miles on\nour journey before my lord opened his mouth, my thoughts having been all\nthat time employed on something quite foreign to my present situation;\nfor I was then but a giddy girl of eighteen. At length my father broke\nsilence, and clapping his lordship on the shoulder, told him he was but\na dull bridegroom; upon which my lord gave him to understand that he was\nout of spirits. This dejection continued all the day, notwithstanding\nthe refreshment of a plentiful dinner which he ate upon the road; and\nin the evening we arrived at the place of our destination, where we were\nkindly received by my mother, though she had no liking to the match;\nand, after supper, we retired to our apartment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was here that I had occasion to perceive the most disagreeable\ncontrast between my present helpmate and my former lord. Instead of\nflying to my arms with all the eagerness of love and rapture, this manly\nrepresentative sat moping in a corner, like a criminal on execution day,\nand owned he was ashamed to bed with a woman whose hand he had scarce\never touched.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI could not help being affected with this pusillanimous behaviour. I\nremembered Lord W--, while I surveyed the object before me, and made\nsuch a comparison as filled me with horror and disgust: nay, to such a\ndegree did my aversion to this phantom prevail, that I began to sweat\nwith anguish at the thought of being subjected to his pleasure; and\nwhen, after a long hesitation, he ventured to approach me, I trembled\nas if I had been exposed to the embraces of a rattlesnake. Nor did the\nefforts of his love diminish this antipathy. His attempts were like\nthe pawings of an imp, sent from hell to seize and torment some guilty\nwretch, such as are exhibited in some dramatic performance, which I have\nnever seen acted without remembering my wedding-night. By such shadowy,\nunsubstantial, vexatious behaviour was I tantalized, and robbed of my\nrepose; and early next morning I got up, with a most sovereign contempt\nfor my bedfellow, who indulged himself in bed till eleven.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving passed a few days in this place, I went home with him to his\nhouse at Twickenham, and soon after we were presented at court, when the\nqueen was pleased to say to my lord's mother, she did not doubt that\nwe should be a happy couple, for I had been a good wife to my former\nhusband.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatever deficiencies I had to complain of in my new spouse, he was\nnot wanting in point of liberality. I was presented with a very fine\nchariot, studded with silver nails, and such a profusion of jewels as\nfurnished a joke to some of my acquaintance, who observed, that I\nwas formerly queen of hearts, but now metamorphosed into the queen of\ndiamonds. I now also had an opportunity, which I did not let slip, of\npaying Lord W--'s debts from my privy purse; and on that score received\nthe thanks of his elder brother, who, though he had undertaken to\ndischarge them, delayed the execution of his purpose longer than I\nthought they should remain unpaid. This uncommon splendour attracted the\neyes and envy of my competitors, who were the more implacable in their\nresentments, because, notwithstanding my marriage, I was as much as\never followed by the men of gallantry and pleasure, among whom it is\na constant maxim, that a woman never withholds her affections from her\nhusband, without an intention to bestow them somewhere else. I never\nappeared without a train of admirers, and my house in the country was\nalways crowded with gay young men of quality.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmong those who cultivated my good graces with the greatest skill and\nassiduity, were the Earl C-- and Mr. S---, brother to Lord F--. The\nformer of whom, in the course of his addresses, treated me with an\nentertainment of surprising magnificence, disposed into a dinner,\nsupper, and ball, to which I, at his desire, invited eleven ladies, whom\nhe paired with the like number of his own sex; so that the whole company\namounted to twenty-four. We were regaled with a most elegant dinner, in\nan apartment which was altogether superb, and served by gentlemen\nonly, no livery servant being permitted to come within the door. In the\nafternoon we embarked in two splendid barges, being attended by a band\nof music in a third; and enjoyed a delightful evening upon the river\ntill the twilight, when we returned and began the ball, which was\nconducted with such order and taste, that mirth and good-humour\nprevailed. No dissatisfaction appeared, except in the countenance of one\nold maid, since married to a son of the duke of --, who though she would\nnot refuse to partake of such an agreeable entertainment, was displeased\nthat I should have the honour of inviting her. O baleful Envy! thou\nself-tormenting fiend! how dost thou predominate in all assemblies, from\nthe grand gala of a court, to the meeting of simple peasants at their\nharvest-home! Nor is the prevalence of this sordid passion to be\nwondered at, if we consider the weakness, pride, and vanity of our sex.\nThe presence of one favourite man shall poison the enjoyment of a whole\ncompany, and produce the most rancorous enmity betwixt the closest\nfriends.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI danced with the master of the ball, who employed all the artillery of\nhis eloquence in making love; yet I did not listen to his addresses, for\nhe was not to my taste, though he possessed an agreeable person, and a\ngood acquired understanding; but he was utterly ignorant of that gentle\nprevailing art which I afterwards experienced in Mr. S---, and which was\nthe only method he could have successfully practised in seducing a young\nwoman like me, born with sentiments of honour, and trained up in the\npaths of religion and virtue. This young gentleman was indeed absolutely\nmaster of those insinuating qualifications which few women of passion\nand sensibility can resist; and had a person every way adapted for\nprofiting by these insidious talents. He was well acquainted with the\nhuman heart, conscious of his own power and capacity, and exercised\nthese endowments with unwearied perseverance. He was tall and thin, of a\nshape and size perfectly agreeable to my taste, with large blue eloquent\neyes, good teeth, and a long head turned to gallantry. His behaviour was\nthe standard of politeness, and all his advances were conducted with the\nmost profound respect; which is the most effectual expedient a man can\nuse against us, if he can find means to persuade us that it proceeds\nfrom the excess and delicacy of his passion. It is no other than\na silent compliment, by which our accomplishments are continually\nflattered and pleases in proportion to the supposed understanding of\nhim who pays it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy these arts and advantages this consummate politician in love\nbegan by degrees to sap the foundation of my conjugal faith: he stole\nimperceptibly into my affection, and by dint of opportunity, which he\nwell knew how to improve, triumphed at last over all his rivals.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNor was he the only person that disputed my heart with Earl C--. That\nnobleman was also rivalled by Lord C. H--, a Scotchman, who had been an\nintimate and relation of my former husband. Him I would have preferred\nto most of his competitors, and actually coquetted with him for some\ntime: but the amour was interrupted by his going to Ireland; upon which\noccasion, understanding that he was but indifferently provided with\nmoney, I made him a present of a gold snuff-box, in which was enclosed\na bank-note; a trifling mark of my esteem, which he afterwards justified\nby the most grateful, friendly, and genteel behaviour; and as we\ncorresponded by letters, I frankly told him, that Mr. S--- had stepped\nin, and won the palm from all the rest of my admirers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis new favourite's mother and sister, who lived in the neighbourhood,\nwere my constant companions; and, in consequence of this intimacy, he\nnever let a day pass without paying his respects to me in person; nay,\nso ingenious was he in contriving the means of promoting his suit, that\nwhether I rode or walked, went abroad or stayed at home, he was always\nof course one of the party; so that his design seemed to engross his\nwhole vigilance and attention. Thus he studied my disposition, and\nestablished himself in my good opinion at the same time. He found my\nheart was susceptible of every tender impression, and saw that I was not\nfree from the vanity of youth; he had already acquired my friendship\nand esteem, from which he knew there was a short and easy transition to\nlove. By his penetration choosing proper seasons for the theme, he urged\nit with such pathetic vows and artful adulation, as well might captivate\na young woman of my complexion and experience, and circumstanced as I\nwas, with a husband whom I had such reason to despise.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThough he thus made an insensible progress in my heart, he did not find\nmy virtue an easy conquest; and I myself was ignorant of the advantage\nhe had gained with regard to my inclinations, until I was convinced of\nhis success by an alarm of jealousy which I one day felt, at seeing him\nengaged in conversation with another lady. I forthwith recognized this\nsymptom of love, with which I had been formerly acquainted, and trembled\nat the discovery of my own weakness. I underwent a strange agitation\nand mixture of contrary sensations. I was pleased with the passion,\nyet ashamed of avowing it even to my own mind. The rights of a husband,\nthough mine was but a nominal one, occurred to my reflection, and\nvirtue, modesty, and honour, forbade me to cherish the guilty flame.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I encouraged these laudable scruples, and resolved to sacrifice\nmy love to duty and reputation, my lord was almost every day employed\nin riding post to my father, with complaints of my conduct, which\nwas hitherto irreproachable; though the greatest grievance which he\npretended to have suffered was my refusing to comply with his desire,\nwhen he entreated me to lie, a whole hour every morning, with my neck\nuncovered, that, by gazing, he might quiet the perturbation of his\nspirits. From this request you may judge of the man, as well as of the\nregard I must entertain for his character and disposition.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDuring the whole summer I was besieged by my artful undoer, and in the\nautumn set out with my lord for Bath, where, by reason of the intimacy\nthat subsisted between our families, we lived in the same house with\nmy lover and his sister, who, with another agreeable young lady,\naccompanied us in this expedition. By this time Mr. S-- had extorted\nfrom me a confession of a mutual flame, though I assured him that\nit should never induce me to give up the valuable possession of an\nunspotted character, and a conscience void of offence. I offered him\nall the enjoyment he could reap from an unreserved intercourse of souls,\nabstracted from any sensual consideration. He eagerly embraced the\nplatonic proposal, because he had sagacity enough to foresee the issue\nof such chimerical contracts, and knew me too well to think he could\naccomplish his purpose without seeming to acquiesce in my own terms, and\ncultivating my tenderness under the specious pretext.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn consequence of this agreement, we took all opportunities of seeing\neach other in private; and these interviews were spent in mutual\nprotestations of disinterested love. This correspondence, though\ndangerous, was, on my side, equally innocent and endearing; and many\nhappy hours we passed, before my sentiments were discovered. At length\nmy lover was taken ill, and then my passion burst out beyond the\npower of concealment; my grief and anxiety became so conspicuous in my\ncountenance, and my behaviour was so indiscreet, that everybody in the\nhouse perceived the situation of my thoughts, and blamed my conduct\naccordingly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertain it is, I was extremely imprudent, though intentionally\ninnocent. I have lain whole nights by my lord, who teased and tormented\nme for that which neither I could give nor he could take, and ruminated\non the fatal consequences of this unhappy flame, until I was worked into\na fever of disquiet. I saw there was no safety but in flight, and often\ndetermined to banish myself for ever from the sight of this dangerous\nintruder. But my resolution always failed at the approach of day, and\nmy desire of seeing him as constantly recurred. So far was I from\npersisting in such commendable determinations, that, on the eve of\nour departure from Bath, I felt the keenest pangs of sorrow at\nour approaching separation; and, as we could not enjoy our private\ninterviews at my house in town, I promised to visit him at his own\napartments, after he had sworn by all that's sacred, that he would\ntake no sinister advantage of my condescension, by presuming upon the\nopportunities I should give.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe kept his word, for he saw I trusted to it with fear and trembling,\nand perceived that my apprehension was not affected, but the natural\nconcern of a young creature, distracted between love and duty, whom, had\nhe alarmed, he would never had seen within his doors again. Instead of\npressing me with solicitations in favour of his passion, he was more\nthan ever respectful and complaisant; so that I found myself disengaged\nof all restraint, conducted the conversation, shortened and repeated my\nvisits at my own pleasure, till at last I became so accustomed to this\ncommunication, that his house was as familiar to me as my own.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving in this manner secured himself in my confidence, he resumed the\nfavourite topic of love, and, warming my imagination by gradual advances\non the subject, my heart began to pant; when he saw me thus moved, he\nsnatched the favourable occasion to practise all his eloquence and art.\nI could not resist his energy nor even fly from the temptation that\nassailed me, until he had obtained a promise that he should, at our\nnext meeting, reap the fruits of his tedious expectation. Upon this\ncondition, I was permitted to retire, and blessed heaven for my escape,\nfully determined to continue in the path of virtue I had hitherto trod,\nand stifle the criminal flame by which my peace and reputation were\nendangered. But his idea, which reigned in my heart without control,\nsoon baffled all these prudent suggestions.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw him again; and he reminded me of my promise, which I endeavoured\nto evade with affected pleasantry, upon which he manifested the utmost\ndispleasure and chagrin, shedding some crocodile tears, and upbraided\nme with levity and indifference. He observed, that he had solicited my\nfavour for ten long months without intermission, and imagined I had held\nout so long on virtuous motives only; but now he could plainly perceive\nthat his want of success had been owing to my want of affection, and\nthat all my professions were insincere. In a word, he persuaded me\nthat his remonstrances were just and reasonable. I could not see the\naffliction of a man I loved, when I knew it was in my power to remove\nit; and, rather than forfeit his opinion of my sincerity and love, I\nconsented to his wish. My heart now flutters at the remembrance of the\ndear though fatal indiscretion; yet I reflect without remorse, and even\nremember it with pleasure.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I could not avoid the censure of the world, I was resolved to bear\nit without repining; and sure the guilt, if there was any in my conduct,\nwas but venial; for I considered myself as a person absolved of all\nmatrimonial ties, by the insignificance of Lord ----, who, though a\nnominal husband, was in fact a mere nonentity. I therefore contracted\na new engagement with my lover, to which I resolved to adhere with the\nmost scrupulous fidelity, without the least intention of injuring my\nlord or his relations; for, had our mutual passion produced any visible\neffects, I would immediately have renounced and abandoned my husband for\never, that the fruit of my love for Mr. S-- might not have inherited,\nto the detriment of the right heir. This was my determination, which\nI thought just, if not prudent; and for which I have incurred the\nimputation of folly, in the opinion of this wise and honest generation,\nby whose example and advice I have, since that time, been a little\nreformed in point of prudentials, though I still retain a strong\ntendency to return to my primitive way of thinking.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I quitted Mr. S--, after the sacrifice I had made, and returned to\nmy own bed, it may, perhaps, be supposed that I slept but little. True:\nI was kept awake by the joyful impatience of revisiting my lover. Indeed\nI neglected no opportunity of flying to his arms. When Lord -- was in\nthe country, we enjoyed each other's company without interruption;\nbut when he resided in town, our correspondence was limited to stolen\ninterviews, which were unspeakably delicious, as genuine love presided\nat the entertainment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSuch was my happiness in the course of this tender communication, that\nto this day I remember it with pleasure, though it has cost me dear in\nthe sequel, and was at that time enjoyed at a considerable expense; for\nI devoted myself so entirely to my lover, who was desirous of engrossing\nmy time and thoughts, that my acquaintance, which was very numerous,\njustly accused me of neglect, and of consequence cooled in their\nfriendships; but I was 'all for love, or the world well lost;' and were\nthe same opportunity to offer, I would act the same conduct over again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSome there are who possibly may wonder how I could love twice with such\nviolence of affection. But all such observers must be unacquainted with\nthe human heart. Mine was naturally adapted for the tender passions, and\nhad been so fortunate, so cherished in its first impressions, that it\nfelt with joy the same sensations revive, when influenced by the same\nengaging qualifications. Certain it is, I loved the second time as well\nas the first, and better was impossible. I gave up my all for both:\nfortune and my father's favour for the one; reputation, friends, and\nfortune for the other. Yet, notwithstanding this intimate connection,\nI did not relinquish the world all at once; on the contrary, I still\nappeared at court, and attracted the notice and approbation of my royal\npatroness; I danced with the P-- of W--; a circumstance which so nearly\naffected Mr. S--, who was present, that, in order to manifest his\nresentment, he chose the ugliest woman in the ball for his partner; and\nI no sooner perceived his uneasiness, than I gave over, with a view of\nappeasing his displeasure.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWithout repeating particular circumstances, let it suffice to say, our\nmutual passion was a perfect copy of that which had subsisted between\nme and my dear Lord W--. It was jealous, melting and delicate, and\nchequered with little accident, which serve to animate and maintain\nthe flame, in its first ardency of rapture. When my lover was sick,\nI attended and nursed him with indefatigable tenderness and care; and\nduring an indisposition, which I caught in the performance of this\nagreeable office, he discharged the obligation with all the warmth of\nsympathy and love.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was, however, judged necessary by the physicians, that I should use\nthe Bath waters for the recovery of my health; and I set out for that\nplace, glad of a pretence to be absent from Lord ----, with whom I lived\non very unhappy terms. He had, about nine months after our marriage,\ndesired that we might sleep in separate beds, and gave a very whimsical\nreason for this proposal. He said, the immensity of his love deprived\nhim of the power of gratification, and that some commerce with an\nobject, to which his heart was not attached, might, by diminishing the\ntransports of his spirits, recompose his nerves, and enable him to enjoy\nthe fruits of his good fortune.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may be sure I made no objection to this plan, which was immediately\nput into execution. He made his addresses to a nymph of Drury Lane,\nwhose name, as he told me, was Mrs. Rock. She made shift to extract some\nmoney from her patient; but his infirmity was beyond the power of her\nart, though she made some mischief between us; and I communicated my\nsuspicion to the duke of H--, who intended to have expostulated with her\nupon the subject; but she got intimation of his design, and saved him\nthe trouble by a precipitate retreat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter my return from Bath, where Mr. S-- and I had lived happily, until\nwe were interrupted by the arrival of my husband, his lordship expressed\nan inclination to be my bedfellow again. In this particular I desired to\nbe excused. I would not be the first to propose the separation, which,\nthough usual in other countries, is contrary to the custom of England,\nbeing unwilling to furnish the least handle for censure, as my character\nwas still unblemished; yet, when the proposal came from him, I thought\nmyself entitled to refuse a reunion; to which I accordingly objected.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis opposition produced a quarrel, which rose to a state of perpetual\nanimosity; so that we began to talk of parting. My lord relished the\nexpedient, agreeing to add three hundred pounds a year to my pin-money,\nwhich, by the bye, was never paid; and I renounced all state and\ngrandeur, to live in a small house that I hired at Carshalton, where I\npassed my time for two months, in the most agreeable retirement, with my\ndear lover. At length I was disturbed by the intrusion of my lord, who\nmolested me with visits and solicitations to return, pretending that he\nhad changed his mind, and insisting upon my compliance with his desire.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI exhausted my invention in endeavours to evade his request; but he\npersecuted me without ceasing. So that I was fain to capitulate, on\ncondition that he should immediately set out for France; and that he\nshould not presume to approach my bed till our arrival at Calais. We\naccordingly departed for that kingdom; and, far from infringing the\nleast article of our treaty, his lordship did not insist upon his\nprivilege before we reached the capital of France.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMeanwhile, I began to feel the effect of my passion in a very\ninteresting manner, and communicated my discovery to the dear author of\nit, who would not leave me in such an affecting situation, but took the\nfirst opportunity of following us to France.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn our road to Paris, we stopped to visit Chantilly, a magnificent\nchateau belonging to the prince of Conde, and there met by accident with\nsome English noblemen, to whom I was known. The prince and his\nsisters invited me very politely into the gallery where they sat. They\ncomplimented me on my person, and seemed to admire my dress, which was\naltogether new to them, being a blue English riding-habit, trimmed with\ngold, and a hat with a feather. They were particularly well pleased with\nmy hair which hung down to my waist, and pressed me to stay a fortnight\nat their house; an invitation which I was very much mortified at\nbeing obliged to refuse, because my lord did not understand the French\nlanguage. I was enchanted with the place and the company, the women\nbeing amiable, and the men polite; nor were they strangers to my name\nand story; for Mr. S-- calling at the same place a few days after, they\nrallied him on my account.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we arrived at Paris, the first thing I did was to metamorphose\nmyself into a Frenchwoman. I cut off my hair, hid a very good complexion\nof my own with rouge, reconciled myself to powder, which I had never\nused before, put on a robe with a large hoop, and went to the Tuileries,\nfull of spirits and joy; for, at that time, everything conspired to make\nme happy. I had health, youth, and beauty, love, vanity, and affluence,\nand found myself surrounded with diversions which were gay, new, and\nagreeable. My appearance drew upon me the eyes of the whole company,\nwho considered me a stranger, but not a foreigner, so completely was I\nequipped in the fashion of the French; and when they understood who I\nwas, they applauded my person with the most lavish encomiums, according\nto their known politeness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter having made a circuit round all the public places of\nentertainment in Paris, I was introduced into the company by an English\nfamily, residing in that city; and, among others, became acquainted with\na French lady, whose charms were remarkably attractive. The duke of K--\nwas her admirer; but she lived in reputation with her mother, and an\nagreeable sister, whose lover was the prince of C--, for almost every\nlady in France has her aimant.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith this charming woman, whose name was Madame de la T--, I often made\nparties of pleasure. The duke, Mr. S--, she, and I, used to meet in the\nBois de Boulogne, which is a pleasant wood, at a small distance from\nParis, whither the company repairs in the summer season for the benefit\nof the air; and, after having amused ourselves among the groves,\nembarked in his grace's equipage, which was extremely elegant, being a\ncalash drawn by six fine long-tailed greys, adorned with ribbons, in the\nFrench taste; and thus we were conducted to a little enchanted, or at\nleast enchanting, palace, possessed by the duke, at one end of the town.\nThe lower apartment, appropriated to me, was furnished with yellow and\nsilver, the bed surrounded with looking-glasses, and the door opened\ninto the garden, laid out in a cradle walk, and intervening parterres of\nroses and other flowers. Above-stairs, my female companion lodged in\na chamber furnished with chintz. We supped all together in the saloon,\nwhich, though small, was perfectly elegant. The company was always\ngood-humoured, the conversation sprightly and joyous, and the scene,\nthough often repeated, still delightful and entertaining.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt other times, Mr. S-- and I used to pass our evenings at the palace\nof the prince of C--, which his highness lent us for our accommodation.\nThe apartments opened into the gardens of the Luxembourg, and were, in\npoint of magnificence, suitable to the owner. Thither I used to repair\nin a flaming equipage, on pretence of visiting, and spent the best part\nof the night with him who was dearer to me than all the princes in the\nworld.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile I was happily engaged in these ravishing parties, my little lord\nwas employed in his efforts to recover his health by restoratives, and\nI know not what; for he still lamented the enfeebling effects of his\npassion, and complained that he loved me more like an angel than a\nwoman, though he strove to govern his affections according to the\ndoctrines of the Christian religion, as he regulated his life by the\nmaxims of Charles the Twelfth of Sweden. The meaning of this declaration\nI could never learn; and, indeed, I have been often tempted to believe\nhe had no meaning at all.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe that as it will, I found my size visibly increasing, and my\nsituation extremely uneasy, on account of the perpetual wrangling which\nprevailed between us, in consequence of his desiring to sleep with me\nagain, after we had parted beds for the second time; and, that I might\nno longer be exposed to such disagreeable persecutions, I resolved to\nleave him, though at the hazard of my life.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThus determined, I went to the British ambassador, in a hackney-coach;\nand, in order to disguise my youth, which might have prepossessed him\nagainst my judgment, muffled myself up in a black hood, which, as he\nsaid, instead of lending an air of gravity to my countenance, added a\nwildness to my looks, which was far from being disagreeable. He had\nbeen a gallant man in his youth, and even then, though well stricken\nin years, was not insensible to the power of beauty. This disposition,\nperhaps, rendered him more favourable to my cause, though he first\nadvised me to return to my husband; but finding me obstinate, he\nundertook to serve me in my own way, and procured a protection from the\nFrench king, by virtue of which I could live at Paris unmolested by my\nlord. Nevertheless, he advised me, if I was determined to leave him, to\nmake the best of my way to England and sue for a divorce. I relished his\nopinion, and concealed myself about three days in Paris, during which I\nborrowed some linen; for, as it was impossible to convey anything out\nof my own house without suspicion, I had neither clothes for my\naccommodation, nor a servant to wait on me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this solitary condition, I took the road to Flanders, after I had\nput my lord upon a wrong scent, by writing a letter to him, dated at\nCalais, and travelled through an unknown country, without any other\nattendant than the postillion, being subjected to this inconvenience by\nthe laws of France, which are so severe in some particulars, that, if\nany person had been apprehended with me, he would have suffered death\nfor going off with a man's wife; though any man might go to bed with\nthat same woman, without fear of incurring any legal punishment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI proceeded night and day without intermission, that I might the sooner\nreach Flanders, where I knew I should be safe; and as the nights were\nexcessively cold, I was fain to wrap myself up in flannel, which\nI bought for the purpose, as I had no clothes to keep me warm, and\ntravelled in an open chaise. While we passed through dreary woods, quite\nremote from the habitations of men, I was not without apprehension of\nbeing stripped and murdered by the postillion; and, in all probability,\nowed my safety to the indigence of my appearance, which might also\nprotect me in two miserable places, where I was obliged to lie, before\nI got out of the territories of France; for, as I could not reach the\ngreat towns where I intended to lodge, I was under the necessity of\nputting up at little wretched hovels, where no provision was to be had,\nbut sour brown bread, and sourer cheese; and everything seemed to denote\nthe dens of despair and assassination.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI made shift, however, to subsist on this fare, uncomfortable as it\nwas, confiding on the meanness of my equipage for the security of my\nperson; and at length arriving at Brussels, fixed my quarters in the\nHotel de Flandre (so well known to the English since), where I thought\nmyself extremely happy in the accomplishment of my flight.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had not been two full days in this place, when I was blessed with the\nsight of my lover, who followed me on the wings of love, in pursuance\nof the plan we had projected before my departure from Paris. Here\nwe concerted measures for proceeding to England. I hired a tall fine\nLiegeoise for my maid, and setting out for Ostend, we embarked in a\nvessel, in which Mr. S-- had bespoke our passage. Our voyage was short\nand prosperous, and our time most agreeably spent in the company of my\ndear partner, who was a most engaging man in all respects, as I dare say\nmy Lady C-- has since found him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI assumed a fictitious name, took private lodgings in Poland-street,\nretained lawyers, and commenced a suit for separation against my lord.\nI communicated the reasons of my elopement to my father, who was shocked\nand surprised at my conduct, which he condemned with expressions of\nsorrow and resentment. But the step was taken; nor did I repent of what\nI had done, except on his account.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the morning after my arrival at London, I waited upon the lord chief\njustice, to whom I complained of the usage I had received from my lord,\nwhose temper was teasing, tiresome, and intolerably capricious. Indeed,\nhis behaviour was a strange compound of madness and folly, seasoned\nwith a small proportion of sense. No wonder then, that I, who am hot\nand hasty, should be wretched, under the persecution of such a perverse\nhumourist, who used to terrify me, and scold at me the whole night\nwithout intermission, and shake my pillow from time to time, that\nI might not sleep, while he tormented me with his disagreeable\nexpostulations. I have been often frightened almost out of my senses, at\nseeing him convulsed with the most unreasonable passion; and chagrined\nto the highest degree of disgust, to find, by repeated observation, his\ndisposition so preposterous, that his satisfaction and displeasure never\ndepended upon the cause he had to be satisfied or disobliged; but, on\nthe contrary, when he had most reason to be pleased, he was always most\ndiscontented, and very often in good-humour when he had reason enough\nfor vexation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile I lived in Poland-street, I was engaged with lawyers, and so\noften visited by my father, that I could not dedicate my whole time as\nusual to my lover; nor was it convenient that he should be seen in my\ncompany: he therefore took a small house at Camberwell, whither I went\nas often as I had an opportunity; and maintained the correspondence with\nsuch eagerness and industry, that, although I was six months gone\nwith child, I have often, by myself, set out for his habitation, in a\nhackney-coach, at eleven o'clock at night, and returned by six in the\nmorning, that I might be in my own bed when my father came to see\nme; for I concealed my amour, as well as the effects of it, from his\nknowledge, and frequently took water from the bridge, that my motions\nmight not be discovered. Nothing but the most passionate love could have\nsupported my spirits under such vicissitudes of fatigue, or enabled my\nadmirer to spend whole days by himself in such a solitary retirement.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy this time, my lord was arrived in England, and employed in\ndiscovering the place of my retreat; so that I lived in continual alarm,\nand provided myself with a speaking-trumpet, which stood by my bedside,\nto be used in calling for assistance, in case my pursuer should make an\nattack upon my lodgings.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis situation being extremely uncomfortable, I had no sooner begun my\nprocess against him, than I put myself entirely under the protection of\nMr. S--, who conducted me to the house of a friend of his who lived in\nthe country, where I was secure from the attempts of my husband. The\nworld had now given me up, and I had renounced the world with the most\nperfect resignation. I weighed in my breast what I should lose in point\nof character, with what I suffered in my peace at home, and found,\nthat my reputation was not to be preserved, except at the expense of\nmy quiet, for his lordship was not disposed to make me easy, had I been\never so discreet. I therefore determined to give up a few ceremonial\nvisits, and empty professions, for the more substantial enjoyments of\nlife.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe passed our time very agreeably in various amusements with this\nfriend of Mr. S--, until the term of my reckoning was almost expired,\nthen returned to London, and took lodgings in Southampton-street, where\nI began to make the preparations for the approaching occasion. Here I\nproposed to live with the utmost circumspection. I disguised my name,\nsaw nobody but my lawyer and lover, and never approached the window lest\nI should be discovered by accident. Notwithstanding these precautions,\nmy French maid, whom I had sent for some of my clothes, was dogged in\nher return, and next morning my lord took my lodgings by storm. Had he\ngiven the assault in his person only, I make no doubt but he would have\nsuffered a repulse from the opposition of the Liegeoise, who made all\nthe resistance in her power; but was obliged to give way to superior\nnumbers. I was at that time abed, and hearing an unusual noise below,\nrang my bell, in order to know the cause of such disturbance. I drew my\ncurtain at the same time, and who should I see entering my chamber\nbut his lordship, attended by a constable, and the footman who had\ndiscovered my retreat!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSuch an unexpected visit could not fail to affect me with surprise\nand consternation. However, I summoned all my fortitude to my aid, and\nperceiving the fellows were about to open my window-shutters, desired\ntheir principal to order them down-stairs. He readily complied with my\nrequest, and sitting down by my bedside, told me with an air of triumph,\nthat he had found me at last; and I frankly owned, that I was heartily\nsorry for his success. Instead of upbraiding me with my escape, he\nproceeded to entertain me with all the news in town, and gave me a\nminute detail of everything that happened to him since our parting;\namong other articles of intelligence, giving me to understand, that he\nhad challenged Mr. S--, who refused to fight him, and was in disgrace\nwith the prince of W-- on that account.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut here his lordship did not strictly adhere to the naked truth. He\nhad indeed, before our departure from the country, gone to my lover, and\ninsisted upon having satisfaction in Hyde Park, two days from the date\nof his demand, and at three o'clock in the afternoon; S--, believing\nhim in earnest, accepted the invitation; though he observed, that these\naffairs could not be discussed too soon, and wished the time of meeting\nmight be an earlier hour. But his lordship did not choose to alter the\ncircumstances of his first proposal; and, when he went away, said he\nshould expect him at the appointed place and time, if it did not rain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis antagonist gave me an account of the conversation, when I assured\nhim the whole business would end in smoke. Accordingly, my lord sent him\na letter on Monday, desiring that the assignation might be deferred till\nThursday, that he might have time to settle his affairs, and pay S--\na hundred pounds, which he had formerly borrowed of him. When Thursday\ncame, he was favoured with another epistle, importing that the\nchallenger had changed his mind, and would seek satisfaction at law.\nThus ended that heroic exploit, which his lordship now boasted of with\nsuch arrogant misrepresentation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile he thus regaled me with these interesting particulars, I was\ncontriving a scheme to frustrate the discovery he had made; so that I\ndid not contradict his assertions, but told him, that, if he would go\ndown-stairs, I would rise and come to breakfast. He consented to this\nproposal with great cheerfulness; and I own I was not a little surprised\nto find him, at this first interview, in as good a humour as if nothing\nhad happened to interrupt the felicity of our matrimonial union.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt cost me some invention to conceal my condition from his notice,\nbeing now within a week of the expected crisis. But I knew I had to\ndo with a man of no great penetration, and succeeded in my attempt\naccordingly. We breakfasted with great harmony, and I invited him to\ndinner, after having prevailed upon him to send away his myrmidons,\nwhom, nevertheless, he ordered to return at eleven o'clock at night. We\nconversed together with great gaiety and mirth. When I rallied him for\nvisiting me in such a dishabille, he stood on tiptoe to view himself in\nthe glass; and, owning I was in the right, said he would go and dress\nhimself before dinner. He accordingly went away, charging my maid to\ngive him entrance at his return; and he was no sooner gone than I wrote\nto Mr. S--, giving him an account of what had happened. Then, without\nhaving determined on any certain plan, I huddled on my clothes, muffled\nmyself up, and calling a chair, went to the next tavern, where I\nstayed no longer than was sufficient to change my vehicle; and, to the\nastonishment of the drawers, who could not conceive the meaning of\nmy perturbation, proceeded to a shop in the neighbourhood, where I\ndismissed my second chair, and procured a hackney-coach, in which I\nrepaired to the lodgings of my lawyer, whom I could trust. Having made\nhim acquainted with the circumstances of my distress, and consulted him\nabout a proper place of retreat, after some recollection, he directed me\nto a little house in a court, to which, by the assistance of my lover,\nmy woman and clothes were safely conveyed that same evening.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord, however, came to dinner, according to invitation, and did not\nseem at all alarmed when my maid told him I was gone, but stepped to my\nlawyer to know if he thought I should return. Upon his answering in the\naffirmative, and advising his lordship to go back in the meantime, and\neat the dinner I had provided, he very deliberately took his advice,\nmade a very hearty meal, drank his bottle of wine, and, as I did not\nreturn according to his expectation, withdrew in order to consult his\nassociates. This motion of his furnished my woman with an opportunity of\nmaking her retreat; and, when he returned at night, the coast was clear,\nand he found nobody in the house, but a porter, who had been left to\ntake care of the furniture. He was so enraged at this disappointment,\nthat he made a furious noise, which raised the whole neighbourhood,\nreinforced his crew with the authority of a justice of the peace,\ntarried in the street till three o'clock in the morning, discharged a\nlodging he had hired at a barber's shop opposite to the house from which\nI had escaped, and retired with the comfortable reflection of having\ndone everything which a man could do to retrieve me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe hurry of spirits and surprise I had undergone in effecting this\nretreat, produced such a disorder in my constitution, that I began\nto fear I should be delivered before I could be provided with the\nnecessaries for the occasion. I signified my apprehension to Mr.\nS--, who, with infinite care and concern, endeavoured to find a more\nconvenient place; and, after all his inquiries, was obliged to fix upon\na paltry apartment in the city, though his tenderness was extremely\nshocked at the necessity of choosing it. However, there was no remedy,\nnor time to be lost, To this miserable habitation I was carried in a\nhackney-coach; and, though extremely ill, bore my fate with spirit and\nresignation, in testimony of my sincere and indelible attachment to\nmy lover, for whose case and pleasure, I could have suffered every\ninconvenience, and even sacrificed my life.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cImmediately after I had taken possession of my wretched apartment, I\nwas constrained by my indisposition to go to bed, and send for necessary\nhelp; and in a few hours a living pledge of my love and indiscretion saw\nthe light, though the terrors and fatigue I had undergone had affected\nthis little innocent so severely, that it scarce discovered any\nvisible signs of life. My grief at this misfortune was inexpressible. I\nforthwith despatched a message to the dear, the anxious father, who flew\nto my arms, and shared my sorrow, with all the gentleness of love\nand parental fondness; yet our fears were, for that time, happily\ndisappointed by the recovery of our infant daughter, who was committed\nto the charge of a nurse in the neighbourhood; so that I could every day\nbe satisfied in my inquiries about her health. Thus I continued a whole\nfortnight in a state of happiness and tranquility, being blessed with\nthe conversation and tender offices of my admirer, whose love and\nattention I wholly engrossed. In a word, he gave up all business and\namusement, and concentrated all his care and assiduity in ministering to\nmy ease and satisfaction: and sure I had no cause to regret what I had\nsuffered on his account.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut this my agreeable situation was one day disturbed by a most\nalarming accident, by which my life was drawn into imminent danger. The\nroom under my bed-chamber took fire: I immediately smelt it, and saw the\npeople about me in the utmost perplexity and consternation, though they\nwould not own the true cause of their confusion, lest my health should\nsuffer in the fright. Nevertheless, I was so calm in my inquiries, that\nthey ventured to tell me my suspicion was but too just; upon which I\ngave such directions as I thought would secure me from catching cold,\nin case there should be a necessity for removing me; but the fire being\nhappily extinguished, I escaped that ceremony, which might have cost me\nmy life. Indeed, it was surprising that the agitation of my spirits did\nnot produce some fatal effect upon my constitution; and I looked upon my\ndeliverance as the protection of a particular providence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThough I escaped the hazard of a sudden removal, I found it was high\ntime to change my lodgings, because the neighbours rushing into the\nhouse, upon the alarm of fire, had discovered my situation, though they\nwere ignorant of my name; and I did not think myself safe in being\nthe subject of their conjectures. Mr. S--, therefore, procured another\ncompartment, with better accommodation, to which I was carried as soon\nas my health would admit of my removal; and soon after my lord wrote\nto me by the hands of my lawyer, earnestly entreating me to drop my\nprosecution, and come home; but I would not comply with his request; and\nnothing was farther from my intention than the desire of receiving any\nfavours at his hands.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThus repulsed, he set on foot a most accurate search for my person; in\nthe course of which he is said to have detected several ladies and young\ngirls, who had reasons for keeping themselves concealed; and had like\nto have been very severely handled for his impertinent curiosity. Being\nunsuccessful in all his attempts, he entered into a treaty with one\nSir R-- H--, a person of a very indifferent character, who undertook\nto furnish him with an infallible expedient to discover the place of my\nabode, if he would gratify him with a bond for a thousand pounds; which\nbeing executed accordingly, this worthy knight advertised me and my maid\nin the public papers, offering one hundred pounds as a reward to any\nperson who should disclose the place of our retirement.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs soon as the paper fell into my hands, I was again involved in\nperplexity; and, being afraid of staying in town, resolved, with the\nconcurrence of my lover, to accept of an invitation I had received from\nthe duke of K--, who had by this time arrived in England, with that lady\nwhom I have already mentioned as one of our parties at Paris. Having\nvisited my little infant, I next day set out for the duke's country\nseat, which is a most elegant chateau, and stands in a charming\nsituation. Mr. S--- followed in a few days. We met with a very cordial\nreception; his grace was civil and good-natured, lived nobly, and loved\npleasure; Madame de la T-- was formed to please. There was always a\ngreat deal of company in the house; so that we passed our time agreeably\nin playing at billiards and cards, hunting, walking, reading, and\nconversation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut my terms of happiness were generally of short duration. In the\nmidst of this felicity I was overtaken by a most severe affliction, in\nthe death of my dear hapless infant, who had engrossed a greater share\nof my tenderness than perhaps I even should have paid to the offspring\nof a legitimate contract; because the circumstance of her birth would\nhave been an insurmountable misfortune to her through the whole course\nof her life, and rendered her absolutely dependent on my love and\nprotection.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile I still lamented the untimely fate of this fair blossom, Lord\n-- came down, and demanded me as his wife; but the suit which I then\nmaintained against him deprived him, for the present, of a husband's\nright; and therefore the duke would not deliver me into his hands.\nIn six months he repeated his visit and demand; and an agreement was\npatched up, in consequence of which I consented to live in the same\nhouse with him, on condition that he should never desire to sleep with\nme, or take any other measure to disturb my peace; otherwise I should\nbe at liberty to leave him again, and entitled to the provision of a\nseparate maintenance. To these articles I assented, by the advice of my\nlawyers, with a view of obtaining the payment of my pin-money, which I\nhad never received since our parting, but subsisted on the sale of my\njewels, which were very considerable, and had been presented to me with\nfull power of alienation. As to my lover, he had no fortune to support\nme; and for that reason I was scrupulously cautious of augmenting his\nexpense.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had now enjoyed each other's company for three years, during which\nour mutual passions had suffered no abatement, nor had my happiness been\nmixed with any considerable alloy, except that late stroke of providence\nwhich I have already mentioned, and the reflection of the sorrow that\nmy conduct had entailed upon my dear father, whom I loved beyond\nexpression, and whom nothing could have compelled me to disoblige but a\nmore powerful flame, that prevailed over every other consideration. As I\nwas now forced to break off this enchanting correspondence, it is not to\nbe doubted that our parting cost us the most acute sensations of grief\nand disappointment. However, there was no remedy. I tore myself from\nhis arms, took my leave of the family, after having acknowledged my\nobligations to the duke, and set out for the place of rendezvous, where\nI was met by my lord, attended by a steward whom he had lately engaged,\nand who was one chief cause of our future separations. My lord, having\nquitted his house in town, conducted me to his lodgings in Pall Mall,\nand insisted upon sleeping with me the first night; but I refused to\ngratify his desire, on the authority of our agreement.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis dispute produced a quarrel, in consequence of which I attempted to\nleave the house. He endeavouring to prevent my retreat, I fairly locked\nhim in, ran down-stairs, and, calling a hackney-coach, made the best of\nmy way into the city, to my father's lodgings, where I lay, the family\nbeing in town, though he himself was in the country. I wrote to him\nimmediately; and, when he came to London, declared my intention of\nseparating from my lord; in which, seeing me obstinate and determined,\nhe at length acquiesced, and a formal separation accordingly ensued,\nwhich at that time I thought binding and immutable.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was now sheltered under the wings of an indulgent father, who had\ntaken me into favour again, on the supposition that my commerce with Mr.\nS-- was absolutely at an end. Nevertheless, though we had separated,\nin all appearance for ever, we had previously agreed to maintain our\ncorrespondence in private interviews, which should escape the notice of\nthe world, with which I was again obliged to keep some measures.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur parting at the duke of K--'s house in the country was attended with\nall the genuine marks of sincere and reciprocal affection, and I lived\nin the sweet hope of seeing him again, in all the transport of his\nformer passion, when my lawyer, who received my letters, brought me a\nbillet one night, just as I had gone to bed. Seeing the superscription\nof S--'s handwriting, I opened it with all the impatience of an absent\nlover; but how shall I describe the astonishment and consternation with\nwhich I was seized, when I perused the contents! Instead of the most\ntender vows and protestations, this fatal epistle began with, Madam,\nthe best thing you can do is to return to your father, or some cold and\nkilling expression to that effect.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeaven and earth! what did I feel at this dire conjuncture! the light\nforsook my eyes, a cold sweat bedewed my limbs, and I was overwhelmed\nwith such a torrent of sorrow and surprise, that everybody present\nbelieved I would have died under the violent agitation. They endeavoured\nto support my spirits with repeated draughts of strong liquor, which had\nno sensible effect upon my constitution, though for eight whole years\nI had drunk nothing stronger than water; and I must have infallibly\nperished in the first ecstasy of my grief, had it not made its way in\na fit of tears and exclamation, in which I continued all night, to the\namazement of the family, whom my condition had alarmed, and raised from\ntheir repose. My father was the only person who guessed the cause of\nmy affliction; he said he was sure I had received some ill-usage in\na letter or message from that rascal S--; so he termed him in the\nbitterness of passion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt mention of that name, my agony redoubled to such a degree that\nall who were present wept at sight of my deplorable condition. My poor\nfather shed a flood of tears, and conjured me to tell him the cause of\nmy disquiet; upon which, rather than confess the truth, I amused his\nconcern by pretending that my lover was ill. The whole family having\nstayed by me till I was a little more composed, left me to the care of\nmy maid, who put me into bed about six in the morning, but I enjoyed no\nrest. I revolved every circumstance of my conduct, endeavouring to find\nout the cause of this fatal change in S--'s disposition; and as I could\nrecollect nothing which could justly give offence, concluded that some\nmalicious persons had abused his ears with stories to my prejudice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith this conjecture I got up, and sent my lawyer to him with a letter,\nwherein I insisted upon seeing him, that I might have an opportunity of\njustifying myself in person; a task which would be easily performed,\nas I had never offended, but in loving too well. I waited with the most\nanxious impatience for the return of my messenger, who brought me an\nanswer couched in the coldest terms of civility which indifference\ncould dictate; acknowledging, however, that he had nothing to lay to my\ncharge, but that it was for the good of us both that we should part. He\nought to have reflected on that before, not after I had sacrificed my\nall for his love! I was well-nigh distracted by this confirmation of\nhis inconstancy; and I wonder to this day how I retained the use of my\nreason under such circumstances of horror and despair! My grief laid\naside all decorum and restraint; I told my father that S-- was dying,\nand that I would visit him with all expedition.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStartled at the proposal, this careful parent demonstrated the fatal\nconsequence of such an unguarded step, reminded me of the difficulty\nwith which he had prevailed upon my mother and uncle to forgive my\nformer imprudence, observed that his intention was to carry me into the\ncountry next day, in order to effect a perfect reconciliation; but now\nI was on the brink of forfeiting all pretensions to their regard, by\ncommitting another fatal error, which could not possibly be retrieved;\nand that, for his part, whatever pangs it might cost him, he was\nresolved to banish me from his sight for ever.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile he uttered this declaration, the tears trickled down his cheeks,\nand he seemed overwhelmed with the keenest sorrow and mortification;\nso it may be easily conceived what were the impressions of my grief,\nreinforced with the affliction of a father whom I dearly loved, and the\nconsciousness of being the cause of all his disquiet! I was struck dumb\nwith remorse and woe; and, when I recovered the use of speech, I told\nhim how sensible I was of his great goodness and humanity, and owned\nhow little I deserved his favour and affection; that the sense of my own\nunworthiness was one cause of my present distraction; for such was the\ncondition of my fate, that I must either see S-- or die. I said,\nthough I could not expect his forgiveness, I was surely worthy of his\ncompassion; that nothing but the most irresistible passion could have\nmisled me at first from my duty, or tempted me to incur the least degree\nof his displeasure; that the same fatal influence still prevailed, and\nwould, in all probability, continue to the grave, which was the only\nabode in which I hoped for peace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile I expressed myself in this manner, my dear good father wept with\nthe most tender sympathy, and, saying I might do as I pleased, for he\nhad done with me, quitted the room, leaving me to the cruel sensations\nof my own heart, which almost burst with anguish, upbraiding me with a\nfault which I could not help committing. I immediately hired a\nchariot and six, and would have set out by myself, had not my father's\naffection, which all my errors could not efface, provided an attendant.\nHe saw me quite delirious and desperate; and therefore engaged a\nrelation of my own to accompany and take care of me in this rash\nexpedition.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDuring this journey, which lasted two days, I felt no remission\nof grief and anxiety, but underwent the most intolerable sorrow and\nsuspense. At last we arrived at a little house called the Hut, on\nSalisbury Plain, where, in the most frantic agitation, I wrote a letter\nto S--, describing the miserable condition to which I was reduced by\nhis unkindness, and desiring to see him, with the most earnest\nsolicitations. This billet I committed to the care of my attendant, and\nlaid strong injunctions upon him to tell Mr. S--, my injuries were so\ngreat, and my despair so violent, that, if he did not favour me with a\nvisit, I would go to him, though at his sister's house, where he then\nwas.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe received my message with great coldness, and told my friend, that,\nif I would return to London without insisting upon the interview I\ndemanded, he would, in a little time, follow me to town, and everything\nshould be amicably adjusted; but when the messenger assured him, that\nI was too much transported with grief to hear of such a proposal, he\nconsented to meet me in the middle of Salisbury Plain, that we might\navoid all observation. And though I was little able to walk, I set\nout for the place of assignation, my companion following at a small\ndistance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I saw him leading his horse down the hill, I collected all my\nfortitude, and advanced to him with all the speed I could exert; but\nwhen I made an effort to speak, my tongue denied its office, and so\nlively was the expression of unutterable sorrow in my countenance, that\nhis heart, hard as it was, melted at the sight of my sufferings, which\nhe well knew proceeded from the sincerity of my love. At length I\nrecovered the use of speech enough to tell him, that I was come to take\nmy leave; and, when I would have proceeded, my voice failed me again.\nBut, after a considerable pause, I found means, with great difficulty,\nto let him know how sensible I was of my own incapacity to retrieve\nhis lost affections; but that I was willing, if possible, to retain\nhis esteem, of which could I be assured, I would endeavour to compose\nmyself; that I was determined to leave the kingdom, because I could not\nbear the sight of those places where we had been so happy in our mutual\nlove; and that, till my departure, I hoped he would visit me sometimes,\nthat I might, by degrees, wean myself from his company; for I should not\nbe able to survive the shock of being deprived of him all at once.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis address may seem very humble to an unconcerned observer; but love\nwill tame the proudest disposition, as plainly appeared in my case; for\nI had naturally as much spirit, or more, than the generality of people\nhave. Mr. S-- was so much confounded at the manner of my behaviour,\nthat he scarce knew what answer to make; for, as he afterwards owned,\nhe expected to hear himself upbraided; but he was not proof against my\ntenderness. After some hesitation, he said, he never meant to forsake\nme entirely, that his affection was still unimpaired, and that he would\nfollow me directly to London. I imposed upon myself, and believed what\nhe said, because I could not bear to think of parting with him for ever,\nand returned to town in a more tranquil state of mind than that in which\nI had left my father, though my heart was far from being at ease; my\nfears being ingenious enough to foresee, that I should never be able to\novercome his indifference.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI took lodgings in Mount-street, and my maid having disposed of herself\nin marriage, hired another, who supplied her place very much to my\nsatisfaction. She was a good girl, had a particular attachment to\nme, and for many years, during which she lived in my service, was\nindefatigably assiduous in contributing to my ease, or rather in\nalleviating my affliction. For, though S-- came up to town according to\npromise, and renewed a sort of correspondence with me for the space of\nfive months, his complaisance would extend no farther; and he gave me\nto understand, that he had determined to go abroad with Mr. V--; whom he\naccordingly accompanied in his envoying to D--.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI understood the real cause of this expedition, which, notwithstanding\nhis oaths and protestations of unabated love and regard, I construed\ninto a palpable mark of dislike and disrespect; nor could the repeated\nassurances I received from him in letters mitigate the anguish and\nmortification that preyed upon my heart. I therefore gave up all hopes\nof recovering the happiness I had lost. I told him on the eve of his\ndeparture, that he might exercise his gallantry a great while, before he\nwould meet with my fellow, in point of sincerity and love; for I would\nrather have been a servant in his house, with the privilege of seeing\nhim, than the queen of England debarred of that pleasure.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen he took his leave, and went down-stairs, I shrunk at every step he\nmade, as if a new wound had been inflicted upon me and when I heard the\ndoor shut behind him, my heart died within me. I had the satisfaction\nto hear afterwards, he lamented the loss of me prodigiously, and that he\nhad never been so happy since. I sat down to write a letter, in which I\nforgave his indifference, because I knew the affections are altogether\ninvoluntary, and wished him all the happiness he deserved. I then walked\nup and down the room in the most restless anxiety, was put to bed by my\nmaid, rose at six, mounted my horse and rode forty miles, in order to\nfatigue myself that I might next night enjoy some repose. This exercise\nI daily underwent for months together; and, when it did not answer my\npurpose, I used to walk round Hyde-park in the evening, when the place\nwas quite solitary and unvisited by any other human creature.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the course of this melancholy perambulation, I was one day accosted\nby a very great man, who, after the first salutation, asked whether or\nnot my intercourse with S-- was at an end, and if I had any allowance\nfrom my husband. To the first of these questions I replied in the\naffirmative; and to the last answered, that my lord did not allow me a\ngreat deal; indeed, I might have truly said nothing at all; but I was\ntoo proud to own my indigence. He then expressed his wonder, how one\nlike me, who had been used to splendour and affluence from my cradle,\ncould make shift to live in my present narrow circumstances; and, when I\ntold him that I could make a very good shift, so I had peace, he seemed\nto lament my situation, and very kindly invited me to sup with his wife\nat his house. I accepted the invitation, without any apprehension of\nthe consequence; and, when I went to the place, was introduced into an\napartment magnificently lighted up, I suppose, for my reception.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter I had stayed alone for some time in this mysterious situation,\nwithout seeing a living soul, my inviter appeared, and said, he hoped\nI would not take it amiss that he and I were to sup by ourselves, as he\nhad something to say, which could not be so properly communicated before\ncompany or servants. I then, for the first time, perceived his drift,\nto my no small surprise and indignation; and, with evident marks of\ndispleasure, told him, I was sure he had nothing to propose that would\nbe agreeable to my inclination, and that I would immediately leave the\nhouse. Upon which he gave me to understand, that I could not possibly\nretire, because he had sent away my chair, and all his servants were\ndisposed to obey his orders.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIncensed at this declaration, which I considered as an insult, I\nanswered, with an air of resolution, it was very well; I despised his\ncontrivance, and was afraid of nothing. Seeing me thus alarmed, he\nassured me I had no reason to be afraid; that he had loved me long, and\ncould find no other opportunity of declaring his passion. He said the\nQ-- had told him that Lord -- had renewed his addresses to me; and,\nas he understood from my own mouth, my correspondence with S-- was\nabsolutely broke off, he thought himself as well entitled as another to\nmy regard. In conclusion, he told me that I might command his purse, and\nthat he had power enough to bring me into the world again with eclat. To\nthese advances I replied, that he was very much mistaken in his opinion\nof my character, if he imagined I was to be won by any temptations of\nfortune; and very frankly declared, that I would rather give myself to a\nfootman, than sell myself to a prince.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSupper being served, we sat down together; but I would neither eat\nnor drink anything, except a little bread and water; for I was an odd\nwhimsical girl, and it came into my head, that he might perhaps have\nmixed something in the victuals or wine, which would alter my way of\nthinking. In short, finding himself baffled in all his endeavours, he\npermitted me about twelve o'clock to depart in peace, and gave up his\nsuit as a desperate cause.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis uncomfortable life did I lead for a whole twelvemonth, without\nfeeling the least abatement of my melancholy. Finding myself worn to a\nskeleton, I resumed my former resolution of trying to profit by change\nof place, and actually went abroad, with no other attendant than my\nwoman, and the utmost indifference for life. My intention was to have\ngone to the south of France, where I thought I could have subsisted on\nthe little I had left, which amounted to five hundred pounds, until the\nissue of my law-suit, by which I hoped to obtain some provision from my\nlord; and, without all doubt, my expectation would have been answered,\nhad I put this my plan in execution; but, being at Paris, from whence\nI proposed to set forward in a few days, I sent to M. K--, who had been\nformerly intimate with my father, and shown me many civilities during my\nfirst residence in France.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis gentleman favoured me with a visit, and, when I made him\nacquainted with my scheme, dissuaded me from it, as an uncomfortable\ndetermination. He advised me to stay at Paris, where, with good economy,\nI could live as cheap as in any other place, and enjoy the conversation\nand countenance of my friends, among which number he declared himself\none of the most faithful. He assured me, that I should be always welcome\nto his table, and want for nothing. He promised to recommend me as a\nlodger to a friend of his, with whom I would live in a frugal and decent\nmanner; and observed, that, as the woman was well known and esteemed by\nall the English company in Paris, it would be the most reputable step\nI could take, considering my youth and situation, to lodge with a\ncreditable person, who could answer for my conduct. Thus persuaded, I\nvery simply followed his advice; I say simply, because, notwithstanding\nhis representations, I soon found my money melt away, without any\nprospect of a fresh supply. In lieu of this, however, I passed my time\nvery agreeably in several English and some French families, where, in a\nlittle time, I became quite intimate, saw a great deal of company, and\nwas treated with the utmost politeness and regard; yet, in the midst of\nthese pleasures, many a melancholy sigh would rise at the remembrance of\nmy beloved S--, whom, for several years, I could not recollect without\nemotion; but time, company, amusements, and change of place, in a great\nmeasure dissipated these ideas, and enabled me to bear my fate with\npatience and resignation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn my last arrival at Paris, I was surrounded by a crowd of professed\nadmirers, who sighed and flattered in the usual forms; but, besides\nthat my heart was not in a condition to contract new engagements, I was\nprepossessed against them all, by supposing that they presumed upon\nthe knowledge of my indiscretion with S--; and therefore rejected their\naddresses with detestation and disdain; for, as I have already observed,\nI was not to be won but by the appearance of esteem, and the most\nrespectful carriage; and though, by a false step, I had, in my own\nopinion, forfeited my title to the one, I was resolved to discourage the\nadvances of any man who seemed deficient in the other.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this manner my lovers were one by one repulsed, almost as soon as\nthey presented themselves, and I preserved the independence of my heart,\nuntil I became acquainted with a certain peer, whom I often saw at the\nhouse of Mrs. P--, an English lady then resident at Paris. This young\nnobleman professed himself deeply enamoured of me, in a style so\ndifferent from that of my other admirers, that I heard his protestations\nwithout disgust; and, though my inclinations were still free, could not\nfind in my heart to discountenance his addresses, which were preferred\nwith the most engaging modesty, disinterestedness, and respect.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy these never-failing arts, he gradually conquered my indifference,\nand gained the preference in my esteem from Lord C-- and the prince of\nC--, who were at that time his rivals. But what contributed more than\nany consideration to his success was his declaring openly, that he would\nmarry me without hesitation, as soon as I could obtain a divorce from\nmy present husband, which, in all probability, might have been easily\nprocured; for, before I left England, Lord -- had offered me five\nthousand pounds if I would consent to such a mutual release, that he\nmight be at liberty to espouse one Miss W--, of Kent, to whom he then\nmade love upon honourable terms; but I was fool enough to refuse his\nproposal, by the advice of S--. And whether or not his lordship, finding\nit impracticable to wed his new mistress, began to make love upon\nanother footing, I know not; but, certain it is, the mother forbade\nhim the house, a circumstance which he took so heinously ill, that\nhe appealed to the world in a public advertisement, beginning with\n'Whereas, for some time, I have passionately loved Miss W--, and, upon\nmy not complying with the mother's proposals, they have turned me out of\ndoors, this is to justify,' etc.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis declaration, signed with his name, was actually printed in a\nnumber of detached advertisements, which he ordered to be distributed to\nthe public; and afterwards, being convinced by some of his friends\nthat he had done a very silly thing, he recalled them at half a guinea\napiece. A copy of one of them was sent to me at Paris, and I believe my\nfather has now one of the originals in his possession. After this wise\nvindication of his conduct, he made an attempt to carry off the lady\nfrom church by force of arms; but she was rescued by the neighbours,\nheaded by her brother, who, being an attorney, had like to have made his\nlordship smart severely for this exploit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMeanwhile my new admirer had made some progress in my heart; and, my\nfinances being exhausted, I was reduced to the alternative of returning\nto Lord -- again, or accepting Earl B--'s love. When my affairs were\nbrought to an issue, I made no hesitation in my choice, putting myself\nunder the protection of a man of honour whom I esteemed, rather than\nsuffer every sort of mortification from a person who was the object of\nmy abhorrence and contempt. From a mistaken pride, I chose to live in\nLord B--'s house, rather than be maintained at his expense in another\nplace. We spent several months agreeably in balls and other diversions,\nvisited Lord B--, who lived at the distance of a few leagues from Paris,\nand stayed some days at his house, where the entertainment was, in all\nrespects, delightful, elegant, and refined. Their habitation was the\nrendezvous of the best company in France; and Lady B-- maintained\nthe same superiority in her own sex, for which her lord is so justly\ndistinguished among the men.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout Christmas we set out for England, accompanied by a little North\nBriton, who lived with Lord B-- as his companion, and did not at all\napprove of our correspondence; whether out of real friendship for his\npatron, or apprehension that in time I might supersede his own influence\nwith my lord, I shall not pretend to determine. Be that as it will, the\nfrost was so severe, that we were detained ten days at Calais before\nwe could get out of the harbour; and, during that time, I reflected\nseriously on what my new lover proposed. As he was very young, and\nunacquainted with the world, I thought my story might have escaped him;\nand therefore determined to give him a faithful detail of the whole,\nthat he might not have anything to reproach me with in the sequel;\nbesides, I did not think it honest to engage him to do more for me\nthan he might afterwards perhaps think I was worth. Accordingly, I\ncommunicated to him every particular of my life; and the narration,\nfar from altering his sentiments, rather confirmed his good opinion, by\nexhibiting an undoubted proof of my frankness and sincerity. In short,\nhe behaved with such generosity, as made an absolute conquest of my\nheart. But my love was of a different kind from that which had formerly\nreigned within my breast, being founded upon the warmest gratitude and\nesteem, exclusive of any other consideration, though his person was very\nagreeable, and his address engaging.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we arrived in England, I went directly to his country seat, about\ntwelve miles from London, where he soon joined me, and we lived some\ntime in perfect retirement. His relations being greatly alarmed with the\napprehension that Lord -- would bring an action against him, though he\nhimself desired nothing more, and lived so easy under that expectation,\nthat they soon laid aside their fears on his account.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were visited by Mr. H. B--, a relation of my lord, and one Mr. R--,\nof the Guards, who, with the little Scotchman and my lover, made an\nagreeable set, among whom I enjoyed hunting, and all manner of country\ndiversions. As to Mr. H. B--, if ever there was perfection in one\nman, it centred in him; or, at least, he, of all the men I ever knew,\napproached the nearest to that idea which I had conceived of a perfect\ncharacter. He was both good and great, possessed an uncommon genius, and\nthe best of hearts. Mr. R-- was a very sociable man, had a good person,\nand cultivated understanding; and my lord was excessively good-humoured;\nso that, with such companions, no place could be dull or insipid. For\nmy own part, I conducted the family; and, as I endeavoured to please and\nmake everybody happy, I had the good fortune to succeed. Mr. B-- told\nme, that before he saw me, he heard I was a fool; but finding, as he was\npleased to say, that I had been egregiously misrepresented, he courted\nmy friendship, and a correspondence commenced between us. Indeed, it was\nimpossible for any person to know him, without entertaining the utmost\nesteem and veneration for his virtue.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter I had lived some time in this agreeable retreat, my husband began\nto make a bustle. He sent a message, demanding me from Lord B--; then\ncame in person, with his nightcap in his pocket, intending to have\nstayed all night, had he been asked, and attended by a relation, whom\nhe assured that I was very fond of him, and detained by force from his\narms. Finding himself disappointed in his expectations, he commenced a\nlaw-suit against Lord B--, though not for a divorce, as we desired,\nbut with a view to reclaim me as his lawful wife. His lawyers, however,\nattempted to prove criminal conversation, in hopes of extorting money\nfrom my lover. But their endeavours were altogether fruitless; for no\nservant of Lord B--'s or mine could with justice say we were ever seen\nto trespass against modesty and decorum; so that the plaintiff was\nnonsuited. While this cause was depending, all my lover's friends\nexpressed fear and concern for the issue, while he himself behaved with\nthe utmost resolution, and gave me such convincing proofs of a strong\nand steady affection, as augmented my gratitude, and riveted the ties of\nmy love, which was unblemished, faithful, and sincere.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSoon after this event, I was seized with a violent fit of illness, in\nwhich I was visited by my father, and attended by two physicians, one of\nwhom despaired of my life, and took his leave accordingly; but Dr.\nS--, who was the other, persisted in his attendance, and, in all human\nappearance, saved my life; a circumstance by which he acquired a great\nshare of reputation. Yet, notwithstanding all his assistance, I was\nconfined to my bed for ten weeks; during which Lord B--'s grief was\nimmoderate, his care and generosity unlimited. While I lay in this\nextremity, Mr. S--, penetrated by my melancholy condition, which revived\nhis tenderness, begged leave to be admitted to my presence; and Lord B--\nwould have complied with his request, had I not been judged too weak to\nbear the shock of such an interview. My constitution, however, agreeably\ndisappointed my fears; and the fever had no sooner left me, than I was\nremoved to a hunting seat belonging to my lover, from whence, after I\nhad recovered my strength, we went to B-- castle, where we kept open\nhouse. And, while we remained at this place, Lord B-- received a letter\nfrom Lord --, dated in November, challenging him to single combat in\nMay, upon the frontiers of France and Flanders. This defiance was\nsent in consequence of what had passed between them long before my\nindisposition, at a meeting in a certain tavern, where they quarrelled,\nand in the fray, my lover threw his antagonist under the table. I\ncounselled him to take no notice of this rhodomontade, which I knew was\nvoid of all intention of performance; and he was wise enough to follow\nmy advice, resolved, however, should the message be repeated, to take\nthe challenger at his word.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving resided some time at this place, we returned to the other\ncountry house which he had left, where Lord B-- addicted himself so\nmuch to hunting, and other male diversions, that I began to think he\nneglected me, and apprised him of my suspicion, assuring him, at the\nsame time, that I would leave him as soon as my opinion should be\nconfirmed. This declaration had no effect upon his behaviour, which\nbecame so remarkably cold, that even Mr. R--, who lived with us,\nimagined that his affection was palpably diminished. When I went to\ntown, I was usually attended by his cousin, or this gentleman, or both,\nbut seldom favoured with his company; nay, when I repaired to Bath, for\nthe re-establishment of my health, he permitted me to go alone; so that\nI was quite persuaded of his indifference; and yet I was mistaken in my\nopinion. But I had been spoiled by the behaviour of my first husband,\nand Mr. S--, who never quitted me for the sake of any amusement, and\noften resisted the calls of the most urgent business, rather than part\nfrom me, though but for a few hours. I thought every man who loved me\ntruly would act in the same manner; and, whether I am right or wrong\nin my conjectures, I leave wiser casuists to judge. Certain it is,\nsuch sacrifice and devotion is the most pleasing proof of an admirer's\npassion; and, Voyez-moi plus souvent, et ne me donnez rien, is one of my\nfavourite maxims. A man may give money, because he is profuse; he may\nbe violently fond, because he is of a sanguine constitution. But, if he\ngives me his time, he gives me an unquestionable proof of my being in\nfull possession of his heart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy appearance at Bath, without the company of Lord B--, occasioned a\ngeneral surprise, and encouraged the men to pester me with addresses,\nevery new admirer endeavouring to advance his suit by demonstrating the\nunkind and disrespectful behaviour of his lordship. Indeed, this was\nthe most effectual string they could touch. My pride and resentment were\nalarmed, I was weak enough to listen to one man, who had like to have\ninsinuated himself into my inclinations. He was tall and large-boned,\nwith white hair, inclining to what is called sandy, and had the\nreputation of being handsome, though I think he scarce deserved that\nepithet. He possessed a large fortune, loved mischief, and stuck\nat nothing for the accomplishment of his designs, one of his chief\npleasures being that of setting any two lovers at variance. He employed\nhis address upon me with great assiduity, and knew so well how to\nmanage my resentment, that I was pleased with his manner, heard his vows\nwithout disgust, and, in a word, promised to deliberate with myself upon\nhis proposals, and give him an account of my determination in writing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThus resolved, I went to Lord B--, in Wiltshire, whither I was followed\nby this pretender to my heart, who visited us on the footing of an\nacquaintance; but when I reflected on what I had done, I condemned my\nown conduct as indiscreet, though nothing decisive had passed between\nus, and began to hate him in proportion to the self-conviction I felt,\nperceiving that I had involved myself in a difficulty from which I\nshould not be easily disengaged. For the present, however, I found means\nto postpone my declaration. He admitted my excuse, and I returned to\nLondon with Lord B--, who was again summoned to the field by his former\nchallenger.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cH--d--n, governor, counsellor, and steward to this little hero, came to\nLord B-- with a verbal message, importing that his lordship had changed\nhis mind about going to Flanders, but expected to meet him, on such\na day and hour, in the burying-ground near Red Lion-square. Lord B--\naccepted the challenge, and gave me an account of what had passed; but\nhe had been anticipated by the messenger, who had already tried to alarm\nmy fears from the consideration of the consequence, that I might take\nsome measures to prevent their meeting. I perceived his drift, and told\nhim plainly, that Lord ---- had no intention to risk his person, though\nhe endeavoured with all his might to persuade me, that his principal was\ndesperate and determined. I knew my little husband too well to think\nhe would bring matters to any dangerous issue, and was apprehensive of\nnothing but foul play, from the villainy of H--d--n, with which I was\nequally well acquainted. Indeed, I signified my doubts on that score to\nMr. B--, who would have attended his kinsman to the field, had he not\nthought he might be liable to censure, if anything should happen to Lord\nB--, because he himself was heir at law: for that reason he judiciously\ndeclined being personally concerned; and we pitched upon the earl of\nA--, his lordship's uncle, who willingly undertook the office.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt the appointed time they went to the house of rendezvous, where they\nhad not waited long when the challenger appeared, in a new pink satin\nwaistcoat, which he had put on for the occasion, with his sword under\nhis arm, and his steward by him, leaving, in a hackney-coach at some\ndistance, a surgeon whom he had provided for the care of his person.\nThus equipped he advanced to his antagonist, and desired him to choose\nhis ground; upon which Lord B-- told him, that if he must fall, it was\nnot material which grave he should tumble over.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur little hero, finding him so jocose and determined, turned to\nLord A--, and desired to speak with him, that he might disburden his\nconscience before they should begin the work of death. They accordingly\nwent aside; and he gave him to understand, that his motive for fighting,\nwas Lord B--'s detaining his wife from him by compulsion. The earl of\nA-- assured him, he was egregiously mistaken in his conjecture; that his\nnephew used no force or undue influence to keep me in his house; but it\ncould not be expected that he would turn me out of doors.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis explanation was altogether satisfactory to Lord --, who said he\nwas far from being so unreasonable as to expect Lord B-- would commit\nsuch a breach of hospitality; and all he desired was, that his wife\nshould be left to her own inclinations. Upon these articles, peace was\nconcluded, and they parted without bloodshed. At least these are the\nparticulars of the story, as they were related by Lord A--, with whom\nI laughed heartily at the adventure, for I never doubted that the\nchallenger would find some expedient to prevent the duel, though I\nwondered how he mustered up resolution enough to carry it so far.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat he might not, however, give us any more trouble, we resolved to\ngo and enjoy ourselves in France, whither I went by myself, in hopes of\nbeing soon joined by my lover, who was obliged to stay some time longer\nin England, to settle his affairs. He was so much affected at our\nparting, though but for a few weeks, that he was almost distracted.\nAnd this affliction renewed my tenderness for him, because it was an\nundoubted proof of his love. I wrote to him every post from France; and,\nas I had no secrets, desired him to take care of all the letters that\nshould come to his house, directed to me, after my departure from\nEngland.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis was an unfortunate office for him, in the execution of which he\nchanced to open a letter from Sir T-- A--, with whom, as I have already\nobserved, I had some correspondence at Bath. I had according to my\npromise, given this gentleman a decisive answer, importing that I\nwas determined to remain in my present situation; but as Lord B-- was\nignorant of my sentiments in that particular, and perceived from the\nletter that something extraordinary had passed between us, and that\nI was earnestly solicited to leave him, he was seized with the utmost\nconsternation and concern; and, having previously obtained the king's\nleave to go abroad, set out that very night for France, leaving his\naffairs in the greatest confusion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir T-- A-- hearing I was gone, without understanding the cause of my\ndeparture, took the same route, and both arrived at Dover next day. They\nheard of each other's motions. Each bribed the master of a packet-boat\nto transport him with expedition; but that depending upon the wind, both\nreached Calais at the same time, though in different vessels. Sir\nT-- sent his valet-de-chambre post, with a letter, entreating me to\naccompany him into Italy, where he would make me mistress of his whole\nfortune, and to set out directly for that country, that he might not\nlose me by the arrival of Lord B--, promising to join me on the road,\nif I would consent to make him happy. I sent his messenger back with\nan answer, wherein I expressed surprise at his proposals, after having\nsignified my resolution to him before I left England. He was scarce\ndismissed, when I received another letter from Lord B--, beseeching me\nto meet him at Clermont, upon the road from Calais; and conjuring me\nto avoid the sight of his rival, should he get the start of him in\ntravelling. This, however, was not likely to be the case, as Lord B--\nrode post, and the other was, by his corpulence, obliged to travel in\na chaise; yet, that I might not increase his anxiety, I left Paris\nimmediately on the receipt of his message, and met him at the appointed\nplace, where he received me with all the agitation of joy and fear,\nand asked if I had ever encouraged Sir T-- A-- in his addresses. I very\ncandidly told him the whole transaction, at which he was incensed; but\nhis indignation was soon appeased, when I professed my penitence, and\nassured him that I had totally rejected his rival. Not that I approved\nof my behaviour to Sir T--, who, I own, was ill-used in this affair; but\nsurely it was more excusable to halt here, than proceed farther in my\nindiscretion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lover being satisfied with my declaration, we went together to\nParis, being attended by the Scotchman, whom I have already mentioned,\nthough I believe he was not over and above well pleased to see matters\nthus amicably compromised. The furious knight followed us to the\ncapital; insisted on seeing me in person; told this North Briton, that\nI was actually engaged to him; wrote every hour, and railed at my\nperfidious conduct. I took no notice of these delirious transports,\nwhich were also disregarded by Lord B--, till, one night, he was\nexasperated by the insinuations of Mr. C--, who, I believe, inflamed\nhis jealousy, by hinting a suspicion that I was really in love with his\nrival. What passed betwixt them I know not, but he sent for me from the\nopera, by a physician of Paris, who was a sort of go-between among us\nall, and who told me, that, if I did not come home in the instant, a\nduel would be fought on my account.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was very much shocked at this information; but, by being used to\nalarms from the behaviour of Lord --, I had acquired a pretty good share\nof resolution, and with great composure entered the room where Lord B--\nwas, with his companion, whom I immediately ordered to withdraw. I then\ngave his lordship to understand, that I was informed of what had passed,\nand thought myself so much injured by the person who had just quitted\nthe apartment, that I would no longer live under the same roof with\nhim. Lord B-- raved like a bedlamite, taxing me with want of candour and\naffection; but I easily justified my own integrity, and gave him such\nassurances of my love, that his jealousy subsided, and his spirits were\nrecomposed. Nevertheless, I insisted upon his dismissing Mr. C--, on\npain of my leaving the house, as I could not help thinking he had used\nhis endeavours to prejudice me in the opinion of my lord. If his conduct\nwas the result of friendship for his patron, he certainly acted the part\nof an honest and trusty adherent. But I could not easily forgive\nhim, because, a few weeks before, he had, by my interest, obtained a\nconsiderable addition to his allowance; and even after the steps he had\ntaken to disoblige me, I was not so much his enemy but that I prevailed\nupon Lord B-- to double his salary, that his leaving the family might\nbe no detriment to his fortune. His lordship having complied with my\ndemand, this gentleman, after having stayed three days in the house,\nto prepare for his departure, during which I would not suffer him to be\nadmitted into my presence, made his retreat with a fine young girl, who\nwas my companion; and I have never seen him since that time.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir T-- still continued furious, and would not take a denial, except\nfrom my own mouth, upon which, with the approbation of Lord B--, I\nindulged him with an interview. He entered the apartment with a stern\ncountenance, and told me I had used him ill. I pleaded guilty to the\ncharge, and begged his pardon accordingly. I attempted to reason the\ncase with him, but he would hear no arguments except his own, and even\ntried to intimidate me with threats; which provoked me to such a degree,\nthat I defied his vengeance. I told him, that I feared nothing but the\nreport of my own conscience; that, though I had acted a simple part, he\ndurst not say there was anything criminal in my conduct, and that, from\nhis present frantic and unjust behaviour, I thought myself happy in\nhaving escaped him. He swore I was the most inflexible of all creatures;\nasked if nothing would move me; and when I answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d took his\nleave, and never after persecuted me with his addresses; though I have\nheard he was vain and false enough to boast of favours, which, upon\nmy honour, he never received, as he himself, at one time, owned to Dr.\nCantwell, at Paris.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile he underwent all this frenzy and distraction upon my account, he\nwas loved with the same violence of passion by a certain Scotch lady of\nquality, who, when he followed me to France, pursued him thither with\nthe same eagerness and expedition. Far from being jealous of me as a\nrival, she used to come to my house, implore my good offices with the\nobject of her love, and, laying herself on the floor at full length\nbefore the fire, weep and cry like a person bereft of her senses. She\nbitterly complained that he had never obliged her but once; and\nbegged, with the most earnest supplications, that I would give her an\nopportunity of seeing him at my house. But I thought proper to avoid her\ncompany, as soon as I perceived her intention.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe continued at Paris for some time, during which I contracted an\nacquaintance with the sister of Madame de la T--. She was the\nsupposed mistress of the prince of C--, endowed with a great share of\nunderstanding, and loved pleasure to excess, though she maintained her\nreputation on a respectable footing, by living with her husband and\nmother. This lady, perceiving that I had inspired her lover with a\npassion, which gave me uneasiness on her account, actually practised all\nher eloquence and art in persuading me to listen to his love; for it\nwas a maxim with her to please him at any rate. I was shocked at her\nindelicate complaisance, and rejected the proposal as repugnant to my\npresent engagement, which I held as sacred as any nuptial tie, and much\nmore binding than a forced or unnatural marriage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon our return to England, we lived in great harmony and peace, and\nnothing was wanting to my happiness, but the one thing to me the most\nneedful; I mean the enchanting tenderness and delightful enthusiasm of\nlove. Lord B--'s heart, I believe, felt the soft impressions; and, for\nmy own part, I loved him with the most faithful affection. It is not\nenough to say I wished him well; I had the most delicate, the most\ngenuine esteem for his virtue; I had an intimate regard and anxiety for\nhis interest; and felt for him as if he had been my own son. But still\nthere was a vacancy in my heart; there was not that fervour, that\ntransport, that ecstasy of passion which I had formerly known; my bosom\nwas not filled with the little deity; I could not help recalling to my\nremembrance the fond, the ravishing moments I had passed with S--. Had\nI understood the conditions of life, those pleasures were happily\nexchanged for my present situation, because, if I was now deprived\nof those rapturous enjoyments, I was also exempted from the cares\nand anxiety that attended them; but I was generally extravagant in my\nnotions of happiness, and therefore construed my present tranquility\ninto an insipid languor and stagnation of life.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile I remained in this inactivity of sentiment, Lord --, having\nreceived a very considerable addition to his fortune, sent a message\nto me, promising, that if I would leave Lord B--, he would make me\na present of a house and furniture, where I should live at my case,\nwithout being exposed to his visits, except when I should be disposed to\nreceive them. This proposal he made in consequence of what I had always\ndeclared, namely, that if he had not reduced me to the necessity\nof putting myself under the protection of some person or other, by\ndepriving me of any other means of subsistence, I should never have\ngiven the world the least cause to scandalize my reputation; and that I\nwould withdraw myself from my present dependence, as soon as he should\nenable me to live by myself. I was therefore resolved to be as good as\nmy word, and accepted his offer, on condition that I should be wholly\nat my own disposal, and that he should never enter my door but as a\nvisitant or common friend.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese articles being ratified by his word and honour, the value\nof which I did not then know, a house was furnished according to my\ndirections; and I signified my intention to Lord B--, who consented\nto my removal, with this proviso, that I should continue to see him. I\nwrote also to his relation, Mr. B--, who, in his answer, observed,\nthat it was too late to advise, when I was actually determined. All my\nfriends and acquaintance approved of the scheme, though it was one\nof the most unjustifiable steps I had ever taken, being a real act of\ningratitude to my benefactor; which I soon did, and always shall regret\nand condemn. So little is the world qualified to judge of private\naffairs!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen the time of our parting drew near, Lord B-- became gloomy and\ndiscontented, and even entreated me to postpone my resolution; but I\ntold him, that now everything was prepared for my reception, I could not\nretract without incurring the imputation of folly and extravagance.\nOn the very day of my departure, Mr. B-- endeavoured, with all the\narguments he could suggest, to dissuade me from my purpose; and I\nmade use of the same answer which had satisfied his friend. Finding me\ndetermined on removing, he burst out into a flood of tears, exclaiming,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy God! if Lord B-- can bear it, I can't.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was thunderstruck at this\nexpression; for though I had been told that Mr. B-- was in love with\nme, I gave no credit to the report, because he had never declared his\npassion, and this was the first hint of it that ever escaped him in\nmy hearing. I was therefore so much amazed at the circumstance of this\nabrupt explanation, that I could make no answer; but having taken my\nleave, went away, ruminating on the unexpected declaration.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord B--, as I was informed, spoke not a word that whole night, and\ntook my leaving him so much to heart, that two years elapsed before he\ngot the better of his grief. This intelligence I afterwards received\nfrom his own mouth, and asked his forgiveness for my unkind retreat,\nthough I shall never be able to obtain my own. As for Mr. B--, he was\noverwhelmed with sorrow, and made such efforts to suppress his concern,\nas had well nigh cost him his life. Dr. S-- was called to him in the\nmiddle of the night, and found him almost suffocated. He soon guessed\nthe cause, when he understood that I had left the house. So that I\nmyself was the only person concerned, who was utterly ignorant of his\naffection; for I solemnly declare he never gave me the least reason\nto suspect it while I lived with his relation, because he had too much\nhonour to entertain a thought of supplanting his friend, and too good an\nopinion of me to believe he should have succeeded in the attempt. Though\nmy love for Lord B-- was not so tender and interesting as the passion I\nhad felt for S--, my fidelity was inviolable, and I never harboured the\nmost distant thought of any other person, till after I had resolved\nto leave him, when, I own, I afforded some small encouragement to the\naddresses of a new admirer by telling him, that I should, in a little\ntime, be my own mistress, though I was not now at my own disposal.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI enjoyed my new house as a little paradise. It was accommodated with\nall sorts of conveniences; everything was new, and therefore pleasing,\nand the whole absolutely at my command. I had the company of a relation,\na very good woman, with whom I lived in the most amicable manner; was\nvisited by the best people in town--I mean those of the male sex, the\nladies having long ago forsaken me; I frequented all reputable places of\npublic entertainment, and had a concert at home once a week; so that\nmy days rolled on in happiness and quiet, till all my sweets were\nembittered by the vexatious behaviour of my husband, who began to\nimportune me again to live with him; and by the increasing anxiety of\nLord B--, who, though I still admitted his visits, plainly perceived\nthat I wanted to relinquish his correspondence. This discovery raised\nsuch tempests of jealousy and despair within his breast, that he kept\nme in continual alarm. He sent messages to me every hour, signed his\nletters with his own blood, raved like a man in ecstasy of madness,\nrailed at my ingratitude, and praised my conduct by turns. He offered\nto sacrifice everything for my love, to leave the kingdom forthwith, and\nlive with me for ever in any part of the world where I should choose to\nreside.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese were generous and tempting proposals; but I was beset with\ncounsellors who were not totally disinterested, and who dissuaded me\nfrom embracing the proffers of my lover, on pretence that Lord -- would\nbe highly injured by my compliance. I listened to their advice, and\nhardened my heart against Lord B--'s sorrow and solicitations. My\nbehaviour on this occasion is altogether unaccountable; this was the\nonly time that ever I was a slave to admonition. The condition of Lord\nB-- would have melted any heart but mine, and yet mine was one of the\nmost sensible. He employed his cousin as an advocate with me, till that\ngentleman actually refused the office, telling him candidly, that his\nown inclinations were too much engaged to permit him to perform the task\nwith fidelity and truth. He accordingly resolved to avoid my presence,\nuntil my lord and I should come to some final determination, which was\ngreatly retarded by the perseverance of his lordship, who would not\nresign his hopes, even when I pretended that another man had engaged my\nheart, but said, that in time my affection might return.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur correspondence, however, gradually wore off; upon which Mr.\nB-- renewed his visits, and many agreeable and happy hours we passed\ntogether. Not that he, or any other person whom I now saw, succeeded to\nthe privilege of a fortunate lover; I knew he loved me to madness; but\nI would not gratify his passion any other way than by the most profound\nesteem and veneration for his virtues, which were altogether amiable and\nsublime; and I would here draw his character minutely, but it would\ntake up too much time to set forth his merit; the only, man living of\nmy acquaintance who resembles him, is Lord F--, of whom I shall speak in\nthe sequel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout this time I underwent a very interesting change in the situation\nof my heart. I had sent a message to my old lover S--, desiring he would\nallow my picture, which was in his possession, to be copied; and he\nnow transmitted it to me by my lawyer, whom he directed to ask, if I\nintended to be at the next masquerade. This curiosity had a strange\neffect upon my spirits; my heart fluttered at the question, and my\nimagination glowed with a thousand fond presages. I answered in the\naffirmative; and we met by accident at the ball. I could not behold him\nwithout emotion: when he accosted me, his well-known voice made my heart\nvibrate, like a musical chord, when its unison is struck. All the ideas\nof our past love, which the lapse of time and absence had enfeebled and\nlulled to sleep, now awoke, and were reinspired by his appearance; so\nthat his artful excuses were easily admitted: I forgave him all that\nI had suffered on his account, because he was the natural lord of my\naffection; and our former correspondence was renewed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought myself in a new world of bliss in consequence of this\nreconciliation, the rapture of which continued unimpaired for the space\nof four months, during which time he was fonder of me, if possible, than\nbefore; repeated his promise of marriage, if we should ever have it in\nour power; assured me he had never been happy since he left me: that\nhe believed no woman loved like me. And indeed, to have a notion of my\npassion for that man, you must first have loved as I did. But, through\na strange caprice, I broke off the correspondence, out of apprehension\nthat he would forsake me again. From his past conduct I dreaded what\nmight happen; and the remembrance of what I had undergone by his\ninconstancy, filled my imagination with such horror, that I could not\nendure the shocking prospect, and prematurely plunged myself into the\ndanger, rather than endure the terrors of expectation. I remembered\nthat his former attachment began in the season of my prosperity, when\nmy fortune was in the zenith, and my youth in its prime; and that he had\nforsaken me in the day of trouble when my life became embarrassed, and\nmy circumstances were on the decline. I foresaw nothing but continual\npersecution from my husband, and feared, that, once the keener\ntransports of our reconciliation should be over, his affection would\nsink under the severity of its trial. In consequence of this desertion,\nI received a letter from him, acknowledging that he was rightly served,\nbut that my retreat gave him inexpressible concern.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMeanwhile Lord -- continued to act in the character of a fiend,\ntormenting me with his nauseous importunities. He prevailed upon the\nduke of L-- to employ his influence in persuading me to live with him;\nassuring his grace, that I had actually promised to give him that proof\nof my obedience, and that I would come home the sooner for being pressed\nto compliance by a person of his rank and character. Induced by these\nrepresentations, the duke honoured me with a visit; and, in the course\nof his exhortations, I understood how he had been thus misinformed. Upon\nwhich I sent for Lord --, and, in his presence, convicted him of the\nfalsehood, by communicating to his grace the articles of our last\nagreement, which he did not think proper to deny; and the duke, being\nundeceived, declared, that he would not have given me the trouble of\nvindicating myself, had he not been misled by the insincerity of my\nlord.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBaffled in this attempt, he engaged Mr. H-- V--, and afterwards my\nown father, in the same task; and though I still adhered to my first\nresolution, persisted with such obstinacy in his endeavours to make me\nunhappy, that I determined to leave the kingdom. Accordingly, after\nI had spent the evening with him at Ranelagh, I went away about two\no'clock in the morning, leaving my companion, with directions to restore\nto my lord his house, furniture, plate, and everything he had given me\nsince our last accommodation; so far was I, upon this occasion, or at\nany other time of my life, from embezzling any part of his fortune. My\nfriend followed my instructions most punctually: and his lordship knows\nand will acknowledge the truth of this assertion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThus have I explained the true cause of my first expedition to\nFlanders, whither the world was good-natured enough to say, I followed\nMr. B-- and the whole army, which happened to be sent abroad that\nsummer. Before my departure, I likewise transmitted to Lord B-- the\ndressing plate, china, and a very considerable settlement, of which he\nhad been generous enough to make me a present. This was an instance of\nmy integrity, which I thought due to a man who had laid me under great\nobligations; and though I lived to be refused a small sum both by him\nand S--, I do not repent of my disinterested behaviour; all the revenge\nI harbour against the last of these lovers, is the desire of having it\nin my power to do him good.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI now found myself adrift in the world again, and very richly deserved\nthe hardships of my condition, for my indiscretion in leaving Lord B--,\nand in trusting to the word of Lord -- without some further security;\nbut I have dearly paid for my imprudence. The more I saw into the\ncharacter of this man, whom destiny hath appointed my scourge, the more\nwas I determined to avoid his fellowship and communication; for he and\nI are, in point of disposition, as opposite as any two principles in\nnature. In the first place, he is one of the most unsocial beings that\never existed; when I was pleased and happy, he was always out of temper;\nbut if he could find means to overcast and cloud my mirth, though never\nso innocent, he then discovered signs of uncommon satisfaction and\ncontent, because, by this disagreeable temper, he banished all company\nfrom his house. He is extremely weak of understanding, though he\npossesses a good share of low cunning, which has so egregiously imposed\nupon some people, that they have actually believed him a good-natured\neasy creature, and blamed me because I did not manage him to better\npurpose; but, upon further acquaintance, they have always found him\nobstinate as a mule, and capricious as a monkey. Not that he is utterly\nvoid of all commendable qualities. He is punctual in paying his debts,\nliberal when in good humour, and would be well-bred, were he not subject\nto fits of absence, during which he is altogether unconversable; but he\nis proud, naturally suspicious, jealous, equally with and without cause,\nnever made a friend, and is an utter stranger to the joys of intimacy;\nin short, he hangs like a damp upon society, and may be properly called\nKill-joy, an epithet which he has justly acquired. He honoured me with\nconstant professions of love; but his conduct is so opposite to my\nsentiments of that passion, as to have been the prime source of all my\nmisfortunes and affliction; and I have often wished myself the object of\nhis hate, in hopes of profiting by a change in his behaviour.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed, he has not been able to make me more unhappy than I believe\nhe is in his own mind; for he is literally a self-tormentor, who never\nenjoyed one gleam of satisfaction except at the expense of another's\nquiet; and yet with this, I had almost called it diabolical quality, he\nexpects that I should cherish him with all the tenderness of affection.\nAfter he has been at pains to incur my aversion, he punishes my disgust,\nby contriving schemes to mortify and perplex me, which have often\nsucceeded so effectually, as to endanger my life and constitution; for\nI have been fretted and frighted into sundry fits of illness, and then I\nown I have experienced his care and concern.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOver and above the oddities I have mentioned, he is so unsteady in his\neconomy, that he is always new-modelling his affairs, and exhausting\nhis fortune, by laying out ten pounds, in order to save a shilling. He\ninquires into the character of a servant, after he has lived two\nyears in his family, and is so ridiculously stocked with vanity and\nself-conceit, that, notwithstanding my assurance before, and the whole\nseries of my conduct since our marriage, which ought to have convinced\nhim of my dislike, he is still persuaded, that, at bottom, I must admire\nand be enamoured of his agreeable person and accomplishments, and that\nI would not fail to manifest my love, were I not spirited against him\nby his own relations. Perhaps it might be their interest to foment the\nmisunderstanding betwixt us; but really they give themselves no trouble\nabout our affairs; and, so far as I know them, are a very good sort of\npeople. On the whole, I think I may with justice pronounce my precious\nyoke-fellow a trifling, teasing, insufferable, inconsistent creature.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith the little money which remained of what I had received from\nhis lordship for house-keeping, I transported myself to Flanders, and\narrived in Ghent a few days after our troops were quartered in that\ncity, which was so much crowded with these new visitants, that I\nshould have found it impracticable to procure a lodging, had I not been\naccommodated by Lord B--, the duke of A--'s youngest brother, who very\npolitely gave me up his own. Here I saw my friend Mr. B--, who\nwas overjoyed at my arrival, though jealous of every man of his\nacquaintance; for he loved me with all the ardour of passion, and I\nregarded him with all the perfection of friendship, which, had he lived,\nin time might have produced love; though that was a fruit which it\nnever brought forth. Notwithstanding his earnest solicitations to the\ncontrary, I stayed but a week in Ghent, from whence I proceeded to\nBrussels, and fixed my abode in the Hotel de Flandre, among an agreeable\nset of gentlemen and ladies, with whom I spent my time very cheerfully.\nThere was a sort of court in this city, frequented by all the officers\nwho could obtain permission to go thither; and the place in general was\ngay and agreeable. I was introduced to the best families, and very\nhappy in my acquaintance; for the ladies were polite, good-tempered, and\nobliging, and treated me with the utmost hospitality and respect. Among\nothers, I contracted a friendship with Madame la comtesse de C-- and her\ntwo daughters, who were very amiable young ladies; and became intimate\nwith the Princess C-- and Countess W--, lady of the bedchamber to the\nqueen of Hungary, and a great favourite of the governor, Monsieur d'H--,\nin whose house she lived with his wife, who was also a lady of a very\nengaging disposition.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSoon after I had fixed my habitation in Brussels, the company at our\nhotel was increased by three officers, who professed themselves my\nadmirers, and came from Ghent, with a view of soliciting my love. This\ntriumvirate consisted of the Scotch earl of --, Lord R-M--, and another\nyoung officer. The first was a man of a very genteel figure and amorous\ncomplexion, danced well, and had a great deal of good-humour, with a\nmixture of vanity and self-conceit. The second had a good face, though\na clumsy person, and a very sweet disposition, very much adapted for the\nsentimental passion of love. And the third, Mr. W-- by name, was tall,\nthin, and well-bred, with a great stock of good-nature and vivacity.\nThese adventurers began their addresses in general acts of gallantry,\nthat comprehended several of my female friends, with whom we used to\nengage in parties of pleasure, both in the city and the environs,\nwhich are extremely agreeable. When they thought they had taken the\npreliminary steps of securing themselves in my good opinion and esteem,\nthey agreed to go on without further delay, and that Lord -- should make\nthe first attack upon my heart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe accordingly laid siege to me, with such warmth and assiduity, that I\nbelieve he deceived himself, and began to think he was actually in love;\nthough, at bottom, he felt no impulse that deserved the sacred name.\nThough I discouraged him in the beginning, he persecuted me with his\naddresses; he always sat by me at dinner, and imparted a thousand\ntrifles in continual whispers, which attracted the notice of the company\nso much, that I began to fear his behaviour would give rise to some\nreport to my prejudice, and therefore avoided him with the utmost\ncaution. Notwithstanding all my care, however, he found means one night,\nwhile my maid, who lay in my room, went downstairs, to get into my\nchamber after I was abed. Upon which, I started up, and told him, that,\nif he should approach me, I would alarm the house; for I never wanted\ncourage and resolution. Perceiving my displeasure, he kneeled by the\nbedside, begged I would have pity on his sufferings, and swore I\nshould have carte blanche to the utmost extent of his fortune. To these\nproposals I made no other reply, but that of protesting I would never\nspeak to him again, if he did not quit my apartment that moment; upon\nwhich he thought proper to withdraw; and I never afterwards gave him\nan opportunity of speaking to me on the same subject. So that, in a\nfew weeks, he separated himself from our society; though the ladies of\nBrussels considered him as my lover, because, of all the other officers,\nhe was their greatest favourite.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis lordship being thus repulsed, Mr. W-- took the field, and assailed\nmy heart in a very different manner. He said he knew not how to make\nlove, but was a man of honour, and would keep the secret, and so forth.\nTo this cavalier address I answered, that I was not angry as I otherwise\nshould have been, at his blunt declaration, because I found by his own\nconfession, he did not know what was due to the sex; and my unhappy\nsituation in some shape excused him for a liberty which he would\nnot have dreamed of taking, had not my misfortunes encouraged his\npresumption. But I would deal with him in his own way; and, far from\nassuming the prude, frankly assured him, that he was not at all to my\ntaste, hoping he would consider my dislike as a sufficient reason to\nreject his love.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord R-- began to feel the symptoms of a genuine passion, which he\ncarefully cherished in silence, being naturally diffident and bashful;\nbut, by the very means he used to conceal it from my observation,\nI plainly discerned the situation of his heart, and was not at all\ndispleased at the progress I had made in his inclinations. Meanwhile he\ncultivated my acquaintance with great assiduity and respect, attended me\nin all my excursions, and particularly in an expedition to Antwerp, with\ntwo other gentlemen, where, in downright gaiete de coeur, we sat for\nour pictures, which were drawn in one piece, one of the party being\nrepresented in the dress of a hussar, and another in that of a running\nfootman. This incident I mention, because the performance, which is now\nin my possession, gave birth to a thousand groundless reports circulated\nin England at our expense.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was immediately after this jaunt that Lord R-- began to disclose his\npassion; though he, at the same time, started such objections as seemed\nto extinguish his hopes, lamenting that, even if he should have the\nhappiness to engage my affections, his fortune was too inconsiderable\nto support us against the efforts of Lord --, should he attempt to\ninterrupt our felicity, and that he himself was obliged to follow the\nmotions of the army. In short, he seemed to consider my felicity more\nthan his own, and behaved with such delicacy, as gradually made an\nimpression on my heart, so that, when we parted, we agreed to renew our\ncorrespondence in England.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the midst of these agreeable amusements, which I enjoyed in almost\nall the different towns of Flanders, I happened to be at Ghent one day,\nsitting among a good deal of company, in one of their hotels, when a\npost-chaise stopped at the gate; upon which we went to the windows to\nsatisfy our curiosity, when who should step out of the convenience, but\nmy little insignificant lord! I no sooner announced him to the company,\nthan all the gentlemen asked whether they should stay and protect me,\nor withdraw; and when I assured them that their protection was not\nnecessary, one and all of them retired; though Lord R-- M-- went no\nfarther than the parlour below, being determined to screen me against\nall violence and compulsion. I sent a message to my lord, desiring him\nto walk up into my apartment; but although his sole errand was to see\nand carry me off, he would not venture to accept of my invitation,\ntill he had demanded me in form from the governor of the place. That\ngentleman, being altogether a stranger to his person and character,\nreferred him to the commanding officer of the English troops, who was a\nman of honour, and, upon his lordship's application, pretended to doubt\nhis identity; observing, that he had always heard Lord -- represented\nas a jolly, corpulent man. He gave him to understand, however, that even\ngranting him to be the person, I was by no means subject to military\nlaw, unless he could prove that I had ever listed in his Majesty's\nservice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThus disappointed in his endeavours, he returned to the inn, and,\nwith much persuasion, trusted himself in my dining-room, after having\nstationed his attendants at the door, in case of accidents. When I asked\nwhat had procured me the honour of this visit, he told me, his business\nand intention were to carry me home. This declaration produced a\nconference, in which I argued the case with him; and matters were\naccommodated for the present, by my promising to be in England some time\nin September, on condition that he would permit me to live by myself, as\nbefore, and immediately order the arrears of my pin-money to be paid. He\nassented to everything I proposed, returned in peace to his own country,\nand the deficiencies of my allowance were made good; while I returned\nto Brussels, where I stayed until my departure for England, which I\nregulated in such a manner as was consistent with my engagement.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI took lodgings in Pall-mall, and, sending for my lord, convinced him\nof my punctuality, and put him in mind of his promise, when, to my utter\nastonishment and confusion, he owned, that his promise was no more than\na decoy to bring me over, and that I must lay my account with living\nin his house like a dutiful and obedient wife. I heard him with the\nindignation such treatment deserved, upbraiding him with his perfidious\ndealing, which I told him would have determined me against cohabitation\nwith him had I not been already resolved; and, being destitute of all\nresource, repaired to Bath, where I afterwards met with Mr. D-- and Mr.\nR--, two gentlemen who had been my fellow-passengers in the yacht from\nFlanders, and treated me with great friendship and politeness, without\neither talking or thinking of love.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith these gentlemen, who were as idle as myself, I went to the jubilee\nat Preston, which was no other than a great number of people assembled\nin a small town, extremely ill-accommodated, to partake of diversions\nthat were bad imitations of plays, concerts, and masquerades. If the\nworld should place to the account of my indiscretion my travelling in\nthis manner with gentlemen to whom I had no particular attachment, let\nit also be considered, as an alleviation, that I always lived in terror\nof my lord, and consequently was often obliged to shift my quarters; so\nthat, my finances being extremely slender, I stood the more in need of\nassistance and protection. I was, besides, young, inconsiderate, and so\nsimple, as to suppose the figure of an ugly man would always secure\nme from censure on his account; neither did I ever dream of any man's\naddresses, until he made an actual declaration of his love.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon my return to Bath, I was again harassed by Lord --, who came\nthither accompanied by my father, whom I was very glad to see, though\nhe importuned me to comply with my husband's desire, and for the future\nkeep measures with the world. This remonstrance about living with\nmy lord, which he constantly repeated, was the only instance of his\nunkindness which I ever felt. But all his admonitions were not of force\nsufficient to shake my resolution in that particular; though the debate\ncontinued so late, that I told his lordship, it was high time to\nretire, for I could not accommodate him with a bed. He then gave me to\nunderstand, that he would stay where he was; upon which my father took\nhis leave, on pretence of looking out for a lodging for himself. The\nlittle gentleman being now left with me, began to discover some signs of\napprehension in his looks; but, mustering up all his resolution, he\nwent to the door, called up three of his servants, whom he placed as\nsentinels upon the stairs, and flounced into my elbow-chair, where he\nresigned himself to rest. Intending to go to bed, I thought it was but\njust and decent that I should screen myself from the intrusion of his\nfootmen, and with that view bolted the door. Lord --, hearing himself\nlocked in, started up in the utmost terror and consternation, kicked the\ndoor with his heel, and screamed aloud, as if he had been in the hands\nof an assassin. My father, who had not yet quitted the house, hearing\nthese outcries, ran upstairs again, and, coming through my bedchamber\ninto the dining-room where we were, found me almost suffocated with\nlaughter, and his heroic son-in-law staring like one who had lost his\nwits, with his hair standing on end.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen my father asked the meaning of his exclamations, he told him, with\nall the symptoms of dismay, that I had locked him in, and he did not\nunderstand such usage. But I explained the whole mystery, by saying, I\nhad bolted the door because I did not like the company of his servants,\nand could not imagine the cause of his panic, unless he thought I\ndesigned to ravish him; an insult than which nothing was farther from my\nintention. My father himself could scarce refrain from laughing at his\nridiculous fear; but, seeing him in great confusion, took pity on his\ncondition, and carried him off to his own lodgings, after I had given\nmy word that I would not attempt to escape, but give him audience next\nmorning. I accordingly kept my promise, and found means to persuade\nthem to leave me at my own discretion. Next day I was rallied upon\nthe stratagem I had contrived to frighten Lord --; and a thousand idle\nstories were told about this adventure, which happened literally as I\nhave related it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom Bath I betook myself to a small house near Lincoln, which I had\nhired of the d-- of A--, because a country life suited best with my\nincome, which was no more than four hundred pounds a year, and that\nnot well paid. I continued some months in this retirement, and saw\nno company, except Lord R-- M--, who lived in the neighbourhood, and\nvisited me twice; till, finding myself indisposed, I was obliged to\nremove to London, and took lodgings in Maddox-street, where my garrison\nwas taken by storm by my Lord -- and his steward, reinforced by Mr. L--\nV-- (who, as my lord told me, had a subsidy of five-and-twenty pounds\nbefore he would take the field) and a couple of hardy footmen. This\nformidable band rushed into my apartment, laid violent hands upon me,\ndragged me down-stairs without gloves or a cloak, and, thrusting me into\na coach that stood at the door, conveyed me to my lord's lodgings in\nGloucester-street. Upon this occasion, his lordship courageously drew\nhis sword upon my woman, who attempted to defend me from his insults,\nand, in all probability, would have intimidated him from proceeding; for\nhe looked pale and aghast, his knees knocked together, and he breathed\nthick and hard, with his nostrils dilated, as if he had seen a\nghost; but he was encouraged by his mercenary associate, who, for the\nfive-and-twenty pounds, stood by him in the day of trouble, and spirited\nhim on to this gallant enterprise.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn consequence of this exploit, I was cooped up in a paltry apartment\nin Gloucester-street, where I was close beset by his lordship and his\nworthy steward Mr. H--, with a set of servants that were the creatures\nof this fellow, of whom my lord himself stood in awe, so that I could\nnot help thinking myself in Newgate, among thieves and ruffians. To such\na degree did my terror avail, that I actually believed I was in danger\nof being poisoned, and would not receive any sustenance, except from the\nhands of one harmless-looking fellow, a foreigner, who, was my lord's\nvalet-de-chambre. I will not pretend to say my fears were just; but such\nwas my opinion of H--, that I never doubted he would put me out of the\nway, if he thought my life interfered with his interest. On the second\nday of my imprisonment, I was visited by the duke of L--, a friend of\nmy lord, who found me sitting upon a trunk, in a poor little diningroom\nfilled with lumber, and lighted with two bits of tallow candle, which\nhad been left overnight. He perceived in my face a mixture of rage,\nindignation, terror, and despair. He compassionated my sufferings,\nthough he could not alleviate my distress any other way than by\ninterceding with my tyrant to mitigate my oppression. Nevertheless, I\nremained eleven days in this uncomfortable situation: I was watched\nlike a criminal all day, and one of the servants walked from one room to\nanother all night, in the nature of a patrol; while my lord, who lay in\nthe chamber above me, got out of bed and tripped to the window at the\nsound of every coach that chanced to pass through the street. H--, who\nwas consummate in the arts of a sycophant, began to court my favour, by\ncondoling my affliction, and assuring me, that the only method by which\nI could regain my liberty was a cheerful compliance with the humour of\nmy lord. I was fully convinced of the truth of this observation; and,\nthough my temper is altogether averse to dissimulation, attempted to\naffect an air of serenity and resignation. But this disguise, I found,\nwould not answer my purpose; and therefore I had recourse to the\nassistance of my maid, who was permitted to attend me in my confinement.\nWith her I frequently consulted about the means of accomplishing my\nescape. In consequence of our deliberations, she directed a coach and\nsix to be ready at a certain part of the town, and to wait for me three\ndays in the same place, in case I could not come before the expiration\nof that term.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis previous measure being taken according to my instructions, the\nnext necessary step was to elude the vigilance of my guard: and in this\nmanner did I effectuate my purpose. Being by this time indulged in the\nliberty of going out in the coach for the benefit of the air, attended\nby two footmen, who had orders to watch all my motions, I made use\nof this privilege one forenoon, when Lord -- expected some company to\ndinner, and bade the coachman drive to the lodgings of a man who wrote\nwith his mouth, intending to give my spies the slip, on pretence of\nseeing this curiosity; but they were too alert in their duty to be thus\noutwitted, and followed me up-stairs into the very apartment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDisappointed in this hope, I resolved another scheme, which was\nattended with success. I bought some olives at an oil-shop; and, telling\nthe servants I would proceed to St. James's-gate, and take a turn in the\npark, broke one of the bottles by the way, complained of the misfortune\nwhen I was set down, and desired my coach might be cleaned before my\nreturn. While my attendants were employed in this office, I tripped\nacross the Parade to the Horse Guards, and chanced to meet with an\nacquaintance in the park, who said, he saw by my countenance that I was\nupon some expedition. I owned his suspicion was just, but, as I had not\ntime to relate particulars, I quickened my pace, and took possession of\na hackney-coach, in which I proceeded to the vehicle I had appointed to\nbe in waiting.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile I thus compassed my escape, there was nothing but perplexity and\nconfusion at home; dinner was delayed till six o'clock; my lord ran half\nthe town over in quest of his equipage, which at last returned, with\nan account of my elopement. My maid was brought to the question, and\ngrievously threatened; but, like all the women I ever had, remained\nunshaken in her fidelity. In the meantime, I travelled night and day\ntowards my retreat in Lincolnshire, of which his lordship had not,\nas yet, got the least intelligence; and as my coachman was but an\ninexperienced driver, I was obliged to make use of my own skill in that\nexercise, and direct his endeavours the whole way, without venturing to\ngo to bed, or take the least repose, until I reached my own habitation.\nThere I lived in peace and tranquility for the space of six weeks,\nwhen I was alarmed by one of my lord's myrmidons, who came into the\nneighbourhood, blustering and swearing that he would carry me off either\ndead or alive.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not to be supposed that I was perfectly easy when I was made\nacquainted with his purpose and declaration, as my whole family\nconsisted of no more than a couple of women and one footman. However, I\nsummoned up my courage, which had been often tried, and never forsook me\nin the day of danger; and sent him word, that, if ever he should presume\nto approach my house, I would order him to be shot without ceremony.\nThe fellow did not choose to put me to the trial, and returned to town\nwithout his errand: but as the place of my abode was now discovered,\nI laid my account with having a visit from his employer; I therefore\nplanted spies upon the road, with a promise of reward to him who should\nbring me the first intelligence of his lordship's approach.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAccordingly, I was one morning apprised of his coming, and, mounting\nhorse immediately, with my woman and valet, away we rode, in defiance of\nwinter. In two days I traversed the wilds of Lincolnshire and hundreds\nof Essex, crossed the river at Tilbury, breakfasted at Chatham, by\nthe help of a guide and moonlight arrived at Dover the same evening,\nembarked for Calais, in which place I found myself next day at two\no'clock in the afternoon; and being heartily tired with my journey,\nbetook myself to rest. My maid, who was not able to travel with such\nexpedition, followed me at an easier pace; and the footman was so\nastonished at my perseverance, that he could not help asking me upon\nthe road, if ever I was weary in my life. Certain it is, my spirits\nand resolution have enabled me to undergo fatigues that are almost\nincredible. From Calais I went to Brussels, where I again set up my\nrest in private lodgings; was again perfectly well received by the\nfashionable people of that place; and, by the interest of my friends,\nobtained the queen of Hungary's protection against the persecution of\nmy husband, while I should reside in the Austrian Netherlands. Thus\nsecured, I lived uncensured, conversing with the English company, with\nwhich this city was crowded; but spent the most agreeable part of my\ntime with the countess of Calemberg, in whose house I generally dined\nand supped. And I also contracted an intimacy with the princess of\nChemay, who was a great favourite with Madame d'Harrach, the governor's\nlady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had not been long in this happy situation, when I was disturbed by\nthe arrival of Lord --, who demanded me of the governor; but finding me\nsheltered from his power, he set out for Vienna; and, in consequence\nof his representations, strengthened with the duke of N--'s name, my\nprotection was withdrawn. But, before this application, he had gone to\nthe camp, and addressed himself to my Lord Stair, who was my particular\nfriend and ally by my first marriage, desiring he would compel me to\nreturn to his house. His lordship told him, that I was in no shape\nsubject to his command; but invited him to dinner, with a view of\ndiverting himself and company at the expense of his guest. In the\nevening, he was plied with so many bumpers to my health, that he became\nintoxicated, and extremely obstreperous, insisted upon seeing Lord Stair\nafter he was retired to rest, and quarrelled with Lord D--, who being\na tall, large, raw-boned Scotchman, could have swallowed him at one\nmouthful; but he thought he might venture to challenge him, in hopes of\nbeing put under arrest by the general. Though he reckoned without his\nhost; Lord Stair knew his disposition, and, in order to punish his\npresumption, winked at the affair. The challenger, finding himself\nmistaken in his conjecture, got up early in the morning, and went off\npost for Vienna. And Lord Stair desired a certain man of quality to make\nme a visit, and give me an account of his behaviour.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeing now deprived of my protection and pin-money, which my generous\nhusband would no longer pay, I was reduced to great difficulty and\ndistress. The duchess d'Aremberg, Lord G--, and many other persons of\ndistinction, interceded in my behalf with his Majesty, who was then\nabroad; but he refused to interpose between man and wife. The countess\nof Calemberg wrote a letter to my father, in which she represented my\nuncomfortable situation, and undertook to answer for my conduct, in case\nhe would allow me a small annuity, on which I could live independent\nof Lord --, who, by all accounts, was a wretch with whom I could never\nenjoy the least happiness or quiet, otherwise she would be the first\nto advise me to an accommodation. She gave him to understand, that her\ncharacter was neither doubtful nor obscure; and that, if my conduct\nthere had not been irreproachable, she should not have taken me under\nher protection. That, as I proposed to board in a convent, a small\nsum would answer my occasions; but, if that should be denied, I would\nactually go to service, or take some other desperate step, to avoid the\nman who was my bane and aversion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo this kind remonstrance my father answered that his fortune would not\nallow him to assist me; he had now a young family; and that I ought,\nat all events, to return to my husband. By this time, such was the\nextremity of my circumstances, that I was forced to pawn my clothes, and\nevery trifling trinket in my possession, and even to descend so far as\nto solicit Mr. S-- for a loan of fifty pounds, which he refused. Thus\nwas I deserted in my distress by two persons, to whom, in the season\nof my affluence, my purse had been always open. Nothing so effectually\nsubdues a spirit unused to supplicate, as want. Repulsed in this manner,\nI had recourse to Lord B--, who was also, it seems, unable to relieve my\nnecessities. This mortification I deserved at his hands, though he had\nonce put it in my power to be above all such paltry applications; and I\nshould not have been compelled to the disagreeable task of troubling my\nfriends, had not I voluntarily resigned what he formerly gave me. As to\nthe other gentleman to whom I addressed myself on this occasion, I\nthink he might have shown more regard to my situation, not only for\nthe reasons already mentioned, but because he knew me too well to be\nignorant of what I must have suffered in condescending to make such a\nrequest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSeveral officers, who guessed my adversity, generously offered to\nsupply me with money; but I could not bring myself to make use of their\nfriendship, or even to own my distress, except to one person, of whom I\nborrowed a small sum. To crown my misfortunes, I was taken very ill,\nat a time when there was no other way of avoiding the clutches of my\npersecutor but by a precipitate flight. In this emergency, I applied\nto a worthy gentleman of Brussels, a very good friend of mine, but no\nlover. I say no lover, because every man is supposed to act in that\ncapacity who befriends a young woman in distress. This generous Fleming\nset out with me in the night from Brussels, and conducted me to the\nfrontier of France. Being very much indisposed both in mind and body\nwhen I was obliged to undertake this expedition, I should in all\nprobability have sunk under the fatigue of travelling, had not my\nspirits been kept up by the conversation of my companion, who was a man\nof business and consequence, and undertook to manage my affairs in such\na manner as would enable me to re-establish my residence in the place I\nhad left. He was young and active, attended me with the utmost care and\nassiduity, and left nothing undone which he thought would contribute to\nmy ease and satisfaction. I believe his friendship for me was a little\ntinctured with another passion; but he was married, and lived very well\nwith his wife, who was also my friend; so that he knew I would never\nthink of him in the light of a lover.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon our arrival at Valenciennes, he accommodated me with a little\nmoney, for a little was all I would take, and returned to his own city,\nafter we had settled a correspondence by letters. I was detained a\nday or two in this place by my indisposition, which increased; but,\nnevertheless, proceeded to Paris, to make interest for a protection from\nthe king of France, which that monarch graciously accorded me, in three\ndays after my first application, and his minister sent orders to all the\ngovernors and intendants of the province towns, to protect me against\nthe efforts of Lord ----, in whatever place I should choose to reside.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving returned my thanks at Versailles for this favour, and tarried\na few days at Paris, which was a place altogether unsuitable to the\nlow ebb of my fortune, I repaired to Lisle, where I intended to fix my\nhabitation; and there my disorder recurred with such violence, that I\nwas obliged to send for a physician, who seemed to have been a disciple\nof Sangrado; for he scarce left a drop of blood in my body, and yet I\nfound myself never a whit the better. Indeed, I was so much exhausted by\nthese evacuations, and my constitution so much impaired by fatigue and\nperturbation of mind, that I had no other hope of recovering but that of\nreaching England, and putting myself under the direction of a physician\non whose ability I could depend.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith this doubtful prospect, therefore, I determined to attempt a\nreturn to my native air, and actually departed from Lisle, in such a\nmelancholy, enfeebled condition, that I had almost fainted when I was\nput into the coach. But before I resolved upon this journey, I was\nreduced to the utmost exigence of fortune, so that I could scarce afford\nto buy provisions, had it been in my power to eat, and should not have\nbeen able to defray my travelling expenses, had I not been generously\nbefriended by Lord R-- H--, who, I am sure, would have done anything\nfor my case and accommodation, though he has unjustly incurred the\nimputation of being parsimonious, and I had no reason to expect any such\nfavour at his hands.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this deplorable state of health I was conveyed to Calais, being all\nthe way, as it were, in the arms of death, without having swallowed the\nleast sustenance on the road. So much was my indisposition augmented by\nthe fatigue of the journey, that I swooned when I was brought into the\ninn, and had almost expired before I could receive the least assistance\nor advice. However, my spirits were a little revived by some bread and\nwine, which I took at the persuasion of a French surgeon, who, chancing\nto pass by the door, was called up to my relief. Having sent my servant\nto Brussels, to take care of my clothes, I embarked in the packet-boat,\nand by the time we arrived at Dover was almost in extremity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere I found a return coach, in which I was carried to London, and was\nput to bed at the house we put up at, more dead than alive. The people\nof the inn sent for an apothecary, who administered some cordial that\nrecalled me to life; and, when I recovered the use of speech, I told him\nwho I was, and desired him to wait upon Dr. S--, and inform him of my\nsituation. A young girl, who was niece to the landlord's wife, seeing\nme unattended, made a tender of her service to me, and I accepted the\noffer, as well as of a lodging in the apothecary's house, to which I was\nconveyed as soon as my strength would admit of my removal. There I was\nvisited by my physician, who was shocked to find me in such a dangerous\ncondition. However, having considered my case, he perceived that\nmy indisposition proceeded from the calamities I had undergone, and\nencouraged me with the hope of a speedy cure, provided I could be kept\neasy and undisturbed. I was accordingly attended with all imaginable\ncare; my lord's name being never mentioned in my hearing, because I\nconsidered him as the fatal source of all my misfortunes; and in a month\nI recovered my health, by the great skill and tenderness of my\ndoctor, who now finding me strong enough to encounter fresh troubles,\nendeavoured to persuade me, that it would be my wisest step to return\nto my husband, whom at that time he had often occasion to see. But I\nrejected his proposal, commencing a new lawsuit for separation, and took\na small house in St. James's-square.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout this time my woman returned from Brussels, but without my\nclothes, which were detained on account of the money I owed in that\nplace; and, asking her dismission from my service, set up shop for\nherself. I had not lived many weeks in my new habitation, when my\npersecutor renewed his attempts to make himself master of my person;\nbut I had learned from experience to redouble my vigilance, and he was\nfrustrated in all his endeavours. I was again happy in the conversation\nof my former acquaintance, and visited by a great number of gentlemen,\nmostly persons of probity and sense, who cultivated my friendship,\nwithout any other motive of attachment. Not that I was unsolicited on\nthe article of love. That was a theme on which I never wanted orators;\nand could I have prevailed upon myself to profit by the advances that\nwere made, I might have managed my opportunities so as to have set\nfortune at defiance for the future. But I was none of these economists\nwho can sacrifice their hearts to interested considerations.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne evening, while I was conversing with three or four of my friends,\nmy lawyer came in, and told me he had something of consequence to\nimpart; upon which all the gentlemen but one went away. Then he gave me\nto understand, that my suit would immediately come to trial; and, though\nhe hoped the best, the issue was uncertain. That, if it should be given\nagainst me, the decision would inspire my lord with fresh spirits to\ndisturb my peace, and, therefore, it would be convenient for me to\nretire, until the affair should be brought to a determination.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was very much disconcerted at this intelligence; and the gentleman\nwho stayed, perceiving my concern, asked what I intended to do, or if he\ncould serve me in any shape, and desired to know whither I proposed to\nretreat. I affected to laugh, and answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo a garret, I believe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To\nthis overstrained reasoning he replied, that if I should, his friendship\nand regard would find the way to my apartment; and I had no reason to\ndoubt the sincerity of his declaration. We consulted about the measures\nI should take, and I determined to remove into the country, where I was\nsoon favoured with a letter from him, wherein he expressed the infinite\npleasure he had in being able to assure me that my suit had been\nsuccessful, and that I might appear again with great safety.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAccordingly, I returned to town in his coach and six, which he had\nsent for my convenience, and the same evening went with him to the\nmasquerade, where we passed the night very agreeably, his spirits, as\nwell as mine, being elevated to a joyous pitch by the happy event of\nmy process. This gentleman was a person of great honour, worth, and\ngood-nature; he loved me extremely, but did not care that I should know\nthe extent of his passion. On the contrary, he endeavoured to persuade\nme, he had laid it down as a maxim, that no woman should ever have power\nenough over his heart to give him the least pain or disquiet. In short,\nhe had made a progress in my affection, and to his generosity was\nI indebted for my subsistence two whole years; during which, he was\ncontinually professing this philosophic indifference, while, at the same\ntime, he was giving me daily assurances of his friendship and esteem,\nand treated me with incessant marks of the most passionate love; so\nthat I concluded his intention was cold, though his temper was warm.\nConsidering myself as an encumbrance upon his fortune, I redoubled my\nendeavours to obtain a separate maintenance from my lord, and removed\nfrom St. James's-square to lodgings at Kensington, where I had not\nlong enjoyed myself in tranquility, before I was interrupted by a very\nunexpected visit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile I was busy one day dressing in my dining-room, I found his\nlordship at my elbow before I was aware of his approach, although his\ncoach was at the door, and the house already in the possession of his\nservants. He accosted me in the usual style, as if we had parted the\nnight before; and I answered him with an appearance of the same careless\nfamiliarity, desiring him to sit down, while I retreated to my chamber,\nlocked the door, and fairly went to bed; being perhaps the first woman\nwho went thither for protection from the insults of a man. Here, then.\nI immured myself with my faithful Abigail. My lord finding me secured,\nknocked at the door, and through the keyhole begged to be admitted,\nassuring me that all he wanted was a conference. I desired to be\nexcused, though I believed his assurance; but I had no inclination to\nconverse with him, because I knew from experience the nature of his\nconversation, which was so disagreeable and tormenting, that I would\nhave exchanged it at any time for a good beating, and thought myself\na gainer by the bargain. However, he persisted in his importunities to\nsuch a degree, that I assented to his proposal, on condition that the\nduke of L-- should be present at the interview: and he immediately sent\na message for his grace, while I, in peace, ate my breakfast, conveyed\nin a basket, which was hoisted up to the window of my bedchamber.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe duke was so kind as to come at my lord's request, and, before I\nwould open the door, gave me his word, that I should be protected from\nall violence and compulsion. Thus assured, they were permitted to enter.\nMy little gentleman, sitting down by my bedside, began to repeat the old\nhackneyed arguments he had formerly used, with a view of inducing me\nto live with him; and I, on my side, repeated my former objections, or\npretended to listen to his representations, while my imagination was\nemployed in contriving the means of effecting an escape, as the duke\neasily perceived by my countenance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFinding all his remonstrances ineffectual, he quitted the chamber, and\nleft his cause to the eloquence of his grace, who sat with me a whole\nhalf-hour, without exerting himself much in behalf of his client,\nbecause he knew I was altogether obstinate and determined on that score;\nbut joked upon the behaviour of his lordship, who, though jealous of\nmost people, had left him alone with me in my bedchamber, observing,\nthat he must neither have great confidence in his virtue, or a very\nbad opinion of him otherwise. In short, I found means to defer the\ncategorical answer till next day, and invited the duke and his lordship\nto dine with me to-morrow. My wise yoke-fellow seemed to doubt the\nsincerity of this invitation, and was very much disposed to keep\npossession of my house. But, by the persuasion of his grace, and the\nadvice of H--, who was his chief counsellor and back, he was prevailed\nupon to take my word, and for the present left me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey were no sooner retired, than I rose with great expedition, packed\nup my clothes, and took shelter in Essex for the first time. Next day,\nmy lord and his noble friend came to dinner, according to appointment;\nand being informed of my escape by my woman, whom I left in the house,\nhis lordship discovered some signs of discontent, and insisted upon\nseeing my papers; upon which my maid produced a parcel of bills which\nI owed to different people. Notwithstanding this disappointment, he sat\ndown to what was provided for dinner, and with great deliberation ate up\na leg of lamb, the best part of a fowl, and something else, which I do\nnot now remember; and then very peaceably went away, giving my maid an\nopportunity of following me to the place of my retreat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy intention was to have sought refuge, as formerly, in another\ncountry; but I was prevented from putting my design in execution by a\nfit of illness, during which I was visited by my physician and some of\nmy own relations, particularly a distant cousin of mine, whom my lord\nhad engaged in his interests, by promising to recompense her amply, if\nshe could persuade me to comply with his desire. In this office she was\nassisted by the doctor, who was my friend, and a man of sense, for whom\nI have the most perfect esteem, though he and I have often differed\nin point of opinion. In a word, I was exposed to the incessant\nimportunities of all my acquaintance, which, added to the desperate\ncircumstances of my fortune, compelled me to embrace the terms that were\noffered, and I again returned to the domestic duties of a wife.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was conducted to my lord's house by an old friend of mine, a\ngentleman turned of fifty, of admirable parts and understanding; he\nwas a pleasing companion, cheerful and humane, and had acquired a great\nshare of my esteem and respect. In a word, his advice had great weight\nin my deliberations, because it seemed to be the result of experience\nand disinterested friendship. Without all doubt, he had an unfeigned\nconcern for my welfare; but, being an admirable politician, his scheme\nwas to make my interest coincide with his own inclinations; for I had,\nunwittingly, made an innovation upon his heart; and as he thought I\nshould hardly favour his passion while I was at liberty to converse with\nthe rest of my admirers, he counselled me to surrender that freedom,\nwell knowing that my lord would be easily persuaded to banish all his\nrivals from the house; in which case, he did not doubt of his being able\nto insinuate himself into my affections; because he laid it down as an\neternal truth, that, if any two persons of different sexes were obliged\nto live together in a desert, where they would be excluded from all\nother human intercourse, they would naturally and inevitably contract an\ninclination for each other.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow just this hypothesis might be, I leave to the determination of the\ncurious; though, if I may be allowed to judge from my own disposition,\na couple so situated would be apt to imbibe mutual disgusts from the\nnature and necessity of their union, unless their association was at\nfirst the effect of reciprocal affection and esteem. Be this as it will,\nI honour the gentleman for his plan, which was ingeniously contrived,\nand artfully conducted; but I happened to have too much address for him\nin the sequel, cunning as he was, though at first I did not perceive his\ndrift; and his lordship was much less likely to comprehend his meaning.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cImmediately after this new accommodation, I was carried to a country\nhouse belonging to my lord, and was simple enough to venture myself,\nunattended by any servant on whose integrity I could depend, in the\nhands of his lordship, and H--, whose villainy I always dreaded;\nthough, at this time, my apprehensions were considerably increased by\nrecollecting, that it was not his interest to let me live in the house,\nlest his conduct should be inquired into; and by remembering that the\nvery house to which we were going had been twice burnt down in a very\nshort space of time, not without suspicion of his having been the\nincendiary, on account of some box of writings which was lost in the\nconflagration. True it is, this imputation was never made good; and,\nperhaps, he was altogether innocent of the charge, which nevertheless\naffected my spirits in such a manner, as rendered me the most miserable\nof all mortals. In this terror did I remain, till my consternation was\nawakened by the arrival of Mr. B--, a good-natured worthy man, whom my\nlord had invited to his house, and I thought would not see me ill-used.\nIn a few weeks we were joined by Dr. S-- and his lady, who visited us\naccording to their promise; and it was resolved that we should set out\nfor Tunbridge, on a party of pleasure, and at our return examine H--'s\naccounts.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis last part of our scheme was not at all relished by our worthy\nsteward, who therefore determined to overturn our whole plan, and\nsucceeded accordingly. My lord, all of a sudden, declared himself\nagainst the jaunt we had projected, and insisted upon my staying at\nhome, without assigning any reason for this peremptory behaviour; his\ncountenance being cloudy, and, for the space of three days, he did not\nopen his mouth. At last, he one night entered my bedchamber, to which\nhe now had free access, with his sword under his arm, and, if I remember\naright, it was ready drawn. I could not help taking notice of this\nalarming circumstance, which shocked me the more, as it happened\nimmediately after a gloomy fit of discontent. However, I seemed to\noverlook the incident, and, dismissing my maid, went to bed; because I\nwas ashamed to acknowledge, even to my own heart, any dread of a person\nwhom I despised so much. However, the strength of my constitution was\nnot equal to the fortitude of my mind. I was taken ill, and the servants\nwere obliged to be called up; while my lord himself, terrified at my\nsituation, ran upstairs to Mrs. S--, who was in bed, told her, with\nevident perturbation of spirits, that I was very much indisposed, and\nsaid, he believed I was frightened by his entering my chamber with his\nsword in hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis lady was so startled at his information, that she ran into my\napartment half naked, and as she went down-stairs, asked what reason\ncould induce him to have carried his sword with him. Upon which he gave\nher to understand, that his intention was to kill the bats. I believe\nand hope he had no other design than that of intimidating me; but when\nthe affair happened, I was of a different opinion. Mrs. S--, having put\non her clothes, sat up all night by my bedside, and was so good as to\nassure me that she would not leave me until I should be safely delivered\nfrom the apprehensions that surrounded me in this house, to which she\nand the doctor had been the principal cause of my coming; for my lord\nhad haunted and importuned them incessantly on this subject, protesting\nthat he loved me with the most inviolable affection; and all he desired\nwas, that I would sit at his table, manage his family, and share his\nfortune. By these professions, uttered with an air of honesty and\ngood-nature, he had imposed himself upon them for the best tempered\ncreature upon earth; and they used all their influence with me to take\nhim into favour. This has been the case with a great many people, who\nhad but a superficial knowledge of his disposition; but, in the course\nof their acquaintance, they have never failed to discern and acknowledge\ntheir mistake.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe doctor, on his return from Tunbridge, to which place he had made a\ntrip by himself, found me ill abed, and the whole family in confusion.\nSurprised and concerned at this disorder, he entered into expostulation\nwith my lord, who owned, that the cause of his displeasure and disquiet\nwas no other than jealousy. He had informed him, that I had been seen\nto walk out with Mr. Bal-- in a morning; and that our correspondence had\nbeen observed, with many additional circumstances, which were absolutely\nfalse and groundless. This imputation was no sooner understood, than it\nwas resolved that the accuser should be examined in presence of us all.\nHe accordingly appeared, exceedingly drunk, though it was morning, and\nrepeated the articles of the charge, as an information he had received\nfrom a man who came from town to hang the bells, and was long ago\nreturned to London.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis was an instance of his cunning and address, which did not forsake\nhim even in his hours of intoxication. Had he fixed the calumny on any\none of the servants, he would have been confronted and detected in his\nfalsehood. Nevertheless, though he could not be legally convicted,\nit plainly appeared that he was the author of this defamation, which\nincensed Mr. Bal-- to such a degree, that he could scarce be withheld\nfrom punishing him on the spot, by manual chastisement. However, he\nwas prevailed upon to abstain from such immediate vengeance, as a step\nunworthy of his character; and the affair was brought to this issue,\nthat his lordship should either part with me or Mr. H--; for I was fully\ndetermined against living under the same roof with such an incendiary.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis alternative being proposed, my lord dismissed his steward, and we\nreturned to town with the doctor and Mrs. S--; for I had imbibed such\nhorror and aversion for this country seat, though one of the pleasantest\nin England, that I could not bear to live in it. We therefore removed to\na house in Bond-street, where, according to the advice of my friends, I\nexerted my whole power and complaisance in endeavours to keep my husband\nin good-humour, but was so unsuccessful in my attempts, that, if ever he\nwas worse tempered, more capricious, or intolerable, at one time than at\nanother, this was the season in which his ill-humour predominated in the\nmost rancorous degree. I was scarce ever permitted to stir abroad, saw\nnobody at home, but my old male friend, whom I have mentioned above; and\nthe doctor, with his lady, from whose conversation, also, I was at last\nexcluded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNevertheless, I contrived to steal a meeting now and then with my late\nbenefactor, for whom I entertained a great share of affection, exclusive\nof that gratitude that was due to his generosity. It was not his fault\nthat I compromised matters with my lord; for he was as free of his purse\nas I was unwilling to use it. It would, therefore, have been unfriendly,\nunkind, and ungrateful in me, now that I was in affluence, to avoid all\nintercourse with a man who had supported me in adversity. I think people\ncannot be too shy and scrupulous in receiving favours; but once they are\nconferred, they ought never to forget the obligation. And I was never\nmore concerned at any incident of my life, than at hearing that this\ngentleman did not receive a letter, in which I acknowledged the last\nproof of his friendship and liberality which I had occasion to use,\nbecause I have since learned that he suspected me of neglect.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut to return to my situation in Bond-street. I bore it as well as I\ncould for the space of three months, during which I lived in the midst\nof spies, who were employed to watch my conduct, and underwent every\nmortification that malice, power, and folly could inflict. Nay, so\nridiculous, so unreasonable was my tyrant in his spleen, that he\ndeclared he would even be jealous of Heydigger, if there was no other\nman to incur his suspicion: he expected that I should spend my whole\ntime with him tete-a-tete; when I sacrificed my enjoyment to these\ncomfortable parties, he never failed to lay hold on some innocent\nexpression of mine, which he made the foundation of a quarrel; and, when\nI strove to avoid these disagreeable misinterpretations by reading or\nwriting, he incessantly teased and tormented me with the imputation of\nbeing peevish, sullen, and reserved.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHarassed by this insufferable behaviour, I communicated my case to\nDr. S-- and his lady, intimating that I neither could nor would expose\nmyself any longer to such usage. The doctor exhorted me to bear my fate\nwith patience; and Mrs. S-- was silent on the subject; so that I still\nhesitated between staying and going, when the doctor, being one night at\nsupper, happened to have some words with my lord, who was so violently\ntransported with passion, that I was actually afraid of going to\nbed with him; and next morning, when he awakened, there was such an\nexpression of frantic wildness in his countenance, that I imagined he\nwas actually distracted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis alarming circumstance confirmed me in my resolution of decamping;\nand I accordingly moved my quarters to a house in Sackville-street,\nwhere I had lodged when I was a widow. From thence I sent a message\nto the duke of L--, desiring he would make my lord acquainted with the\nplace of my abode, my reasons for removing, and my intention to defend\nmyself against all his attempts. The first night of this separation I\nwent to bed by myself with as much pleasure as a man would feel in going\nto bed to his mistress whom he had long solicited in vain, so rejoiced\nwas I to be delivered from my obnoxious bedfellow!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom these lodgings I soon moved to Brook-street, where I had not long\nenjoyed the sweets of my escape, when I was importuned to return, by a\nnew steward whom my lord had engaged in the room of H--. This gentleman,\nwho bore a very fair character, made such judicious representations, and\nbehaved so candidly in the discharge of his function, that I agreed\nhe should act as umpire in the difference betwixt us, and once more\na reconciliation was effected, though his lordship began to be\ndissatisfied even before the execution of our agreement; in consequence\nof which he attended me to Bath, whither I went for the benefit of my\nhealth, which was not a little impaired.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis accommodation had a surprising effect upon my lover, who,\nnotwithstanding his repeated declarations, that no woman should ever\ngain such an ascendancy over his heart as to be able to give him pain,\nsuffered all the agonies of disappointed love, when he now found himself\ndeprived of the opportunities of seeing me, and behaved very differently\nfrom what he had imagined he should. His words and actions were\ndesperate: one of his expressions to me was, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is like twisting my\nheart-strings, and tearing it out of my body.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Indeed, I never should\nhave acted this part had I foreseen what he would have suffered; but\nI protest I believed him, when he said otherwise, so much, that his\ndeclaration on that subject was the occasion of my giving him up; and it\nwas now too late to retract.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn our expedition to Bath, I was accompanied by a very agreeable young\nlady, with whom I passed my time very happily, amid the diversions of\nthe place, which screened me, in a good measure, from the vexatious\nsociety of my hopeful partner. From this place we repaired to his seat\nin the country, where we spent a few months, and thence returned again\nto our house in Bond-street. Here, while I was confined to my bed by\nillness, it was supposed my indisposition was no other than a private\nlying-in, though I was under the roof with my lord, and attended by his\nservants.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile the distemper continued, my lord, to do him justice, behaved with\nall imaginable tenderness and care; and his concern on these occasions I\nhave already mentioned as a strange inconsistency in his disposition.\nIf his actions were at all accountable, I should think he took pains to\nfret me into a fever first, in order to manifest his love and humanity\nafterwards. When I recovered my strength and spirits, I went abroad,\nsaw company, and should have been easy, had he been contented; but as\nmy satisfaction increased, his good-humour decayed, and he banished from\nhis house, one by one, all the people whose conversation could have made\nmy life agreeable.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI often expostulated with him on his malignant behaviour, protesting\nmy desire of living peaceably with him, and begging he would not lay\nme under the necessity of changing my measures. He was deaf to all\nmy remonstrances, though I warned him more than once of the event,\npersisted in his maxims of persecution; and, after repeated quarrels, I\nagain left his house fully determined to suffer all sorts of extremity,\nrather than subject myself to the tyranny of his disposition.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis year was productive of one fatal event, which I felt with\nthe utmost sensibility of sorrow, and I shall always remember with\nregret:--I mean the death of Mr. B--, with whom I had constantly\nmaintained an intimate correspondence since the first commencement of\nour acquaintance. He was one of the most valuable men, and promised\nto be one of the brightest ornaments that this or any other age had\nproduced. I enjoyed his friendship without reserve; and such was the\nconfidence he reposed in my integrity, from long experience of my truth,\nthat he often said he would believe my bare assertion, even though it\nshould contradict the evidence of his own senses. These being the terms\nupon which we lived, it is not to be supposed that I bore the loss of\nhim without repining. Indeed, my grief was unspeakable; and, though the\nedge of it be now smoothed by the lenient hand of time, I shall never\ncease to cherish his memory with the most tender remembrance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDuring the last period of my living with my lord, I had agreed to the\nexpediency of obtaining an act of parliament, which would enable him to\npay his debts; on which occasion there was a necessity of cancelling a\ndeed that subsisted between us, relating to a separate maintenance, to\nwhich, on certain provisions, I was entitled; and this was to be set\naside, so far as it interfered with the above-mentioned scheme, while\nthe rest of it should remain in force. When this affair was about to\nbe transacted, my lord very generously insisted upon my concurrence in\nannulling the whole settlement; and, when I refused to comply with this\ndemand, because this was the sole resource I had against his ill-usage,\nhe would not proceed in the execution of his plan, though, by dropping\nit, he hurt nobody but himself; and he accused me of having receded from\nmy word, after I had drawn him into considerable expense.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis imputation of breaking my word, which I defy the whole world to\nprove I ever did, incensed me the more, as I myself had proposed the\nscheme for his service, although I knew the accomplishment of it would\nendanger the validity of my own settlement; and my indignation was still\nmore augmented by the behaviour of Mr. G--, who had always professed\na regard for my interest, and upon my last accommodation with my lord,\nundertaken to effect a reconciliation between my father and me; but,\nwhen he was questioned about the particulars of this difference, and\ndesired to declare whether his lordship or I was to blame, he declined\nthe office of arbitrator, refused to be explicit upon the subject, and\nby certain shrewd hums and ha's, signified his disapprobation of my\nconduct. Yet this very man, when I imparted to him, in confidence, my\nintention of making another retreat, and frankly asked his opinion of\nmy design, seemed to acquiesce in the justice of it in these remarkable\nwords: 'Madam, if I thought or had hopes of my lord growing better, I\nwould down on my knees to desire you to stay; but, as I have not, I say\nnothing.'\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf he connived at my conduct in this particular, why should he\ndisapprove of it when all I asked was but common justice? But he was\na dependant; and therefore I excuse his phlegmatic, not to call it\nunfriendly, behaviour. Indeed, he could not be too cautious of giving\noffence to his lordship, who sometimes made him feel the effects of that\nwrath which other people had kindled; particularly in consequence of a\nsmall adventure which happened about this very period of time.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA very agreeable, sprightly, good-natured young man, a near relation of\nmy lord, happening to be at our house one evening, when there was a fire\nin the neighbourhood, we agreed to go and sup at the tavern en famille;\nand, having spent the evening with great mirth and good-humour, this\nyoung gentleman, who was naturally facetious, in taking his leave,\nsaluted us all round. My lord, who had before entertained some jealousy\nof his kinsman, was very much provoked by this trifling incident, but\nvery prudently suppressed his displeasure till he returned to his own\nhouse, where his rage co-operating with the champagne he had drunk,\ninflamed him to such a degree of resolution, that he sprang upon the\ninnocent G--, and collared him with great fury, though he was altogether\nunconcerned in the cause of his indignation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis extravagant and frantic behaviour, added to other grievances under\nwhich I laboured, hastened my resolution of leaving him; and he, to this\nday, blames his relation as the immediate cause of my escape, whereas\nhe ought to place it to the account of his own madness and indiscretion.\nWhen I retired to Park-street, he cautioned all my tradesmen, not even\nexcepting my baker, against giving me credit, assuring them that he\nwould not pay any debts I should contract; and the difficulties to which\nI was reduced, in consequence of this charitable declaration, together\nwith the reflection of what I had suffered, and might undergo, from the\ncaprice and barbarity of his disposition, affected my health so much,\nthat I was again taken ill, and my life thought in danger.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy constitution, however, got the better of my distemper, and I was\nordered into the country by my physicians, for the benefit of the air;\nso that I found myself under the necessity of keeping two houses, when\nI was little able to support one, and set up my chariot, because I could\nnot defray the expense of a hackney-coach; for I had as much credit\ngiven me as I asked for, notwithstanding my lord's orders to the\ncontrary.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving recruited my spirits in the country, I returned to town, and\nwas visited by my friends, who never forsook me in adversity, and in the\nsummer removed to a house in Essex, where I lived a few months in great\ntranquility, unmolested by my tyrant, who sometimes gave me a whole\nyear's respite. Here I used to ride and drive by turns, as my humour\ndictated, with horses which were lent me; and I had the company of my\nlover, and another gentleman, who was a very agreeable companion, and of\nsingular service to me in the sequel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt last, my lord having received intelligence of the place of my abode,\nand his tormenting humour recurring, he set out for my habitation, and\nin the morning appeared in his coach and six, attended by Mr. G--\nand another person, whom he had engaged for the purpose, with several\ndomestics armed. I immediately shut up my doors at his approach, and\nrefused him admittance, which he endeavoured to obtain by a succession\nof prayers and threats; but I was deaf to both, and resolved to hold out\nto the last. Seeing me determined, he began his attack, and his servants\nactually forced their way into the house; upon which I retreated\nup-stairs, and fortified myself in my apartment, which the assailants\nstormed with such fury, that the door began to give way, and I retired\ninto another room.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhilst I remained in this post, Mr. G-- demanded a parley, in which he\nbegged I would favour my lord with an interview, otherwise he knew not\nwhat might be the consequence. To this remonstrance I replied, that I\nwas not disposed to comply with his request; and though their\ndesign should be murder, I was not at all afraid of death. Upon this\ndeclaration they renewed their attacks, which they carried on with\nindifferent success till the afternoon, when my lord, as if he had been\nat play, sent a formal message to me, desiring that all hostilities\nshould cease, till after both parties should have dined. At the same\ntime, my own servants came for instructions; and I ordered them to let\nhim have everything which he should call for, as far as the house would\nafford.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe did not fail to make use of this permission; but sitting down with\nhis companions, ate up my dinner without hesitation, after he had paid\nme the compliment of desiring to know what he should send up to my\napartment. Far from having any stomach to partake of his meal, I sat\nsolitary upon my bed, in a state of melancholy expectation, having\nfastened the door of the outward room for my security, while I kept my\nchamber open for the convenience of air, the weather being excessively\nhot. His lordship, having indulged his appetite, resumed his attempt,\nand all of a sudden I heard a noise in the next room; upon which I\nstarted up, and perceiving that he had got into my ante-chamber, by the\nhelp of a bench that stood under the window, I flung to the door of my\nroom, which I locked with great expedition, and opening another that\ncommunicated with the staircase, ran out of the house, through a crowd\nof more than a hundred people, whom this fray had gathered together.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeing universally beloved in the neighbourhood, and respected by my\nlord's servants, I passed among them untouched, and took refuge in\na neighbouring cottage; while his lordship bawled and roared for\nassistance, being afraid to come out as he had gone in. Without waiting\nfor his deliberations, I changed clothes with the poor woman who had\ngiven me shelter, and in her blue apron and straw hat sallied out into\nthe fields, intending to seek protection in the house of a gentleman not\nfar off, though I was utterly ignorant of the road that led me to it.\nHowever, it was my good fortune to meet with a farmer, who undertook to\nconduct me to the place; otherwise I should have missed my way, and\nin all probability lain in the fields; for by this time it was eight\no'clock at night.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder the direction of this guide, I traversed hedges and ditches; for\nI would not venture to travel in the highway, lest I should fall into\nthe hands of my pursuer, and after I had actually tumbled into the mire,\nand walked six or seven long miles by the help of a good spirit, which\nnever failed me on such occasions, I arrived at the place, and rung the\nbell at the garden gate for admittance. Seeing my figure, which was very\nuncouth, together with my draggled condition, they denied me entrance;\nbut, when they understood who I was, immediately opened the door, and I\nwas hospitably entertained, after having been the subject of mirth, on\naccount of my dress and adventure.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNext day I returned and took possession of my house again, where I\nresumed my former amusements, which I enjoyed in quiet for the space\nof a whole month, waiting with resignation for the issue of my lawsuit;\nwhen, one afternoon, I was apprised of his lordship's approach by one\nof my spies, whom I always employed to reconnoitre the road; and so\nfortunate was I in the choice of these scouts, that I never was betrayed\nby one of them, though they were often bribed for that purpose. I\nno sooner received this intelligence, than I ordered my horse to be\nsaddled, and, mounting, rode out of sight immediately, directing my\ncourse a different way from the London road. I had not long proceeded\nin this track, when my career was all of a sudden stopped by a five-bar\ngate, which, after some hesitation, I resolved to leap (my horse being\nan old hunter), if I should find myself pursued. However, with much\ndifficulty I made a shift to open it, and arrived in safety at the house\nof my very good friend Mr. G--, who, being a justice of the peace, had\npromised me his protection, if it should be wanted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThus secured for the present, I sent out spies to bring information of\nhis lordship's proceedings, and understood that he had taken possession\nof my house, turned my servants adrift, and made himself master of all\nmy movables, clothes, and papers. As for the papers, they were of no\nconsequence, but of clothes I had a good stock; and, when I had reason\nto believe that he did not intend to relinquish his conquest, I thought\nit was high time for me to remove to a greater distance from his\nquarters. Accordingly, two days after my escape, I set out at eleven\no'clock at night, in a chariot and four, which I borrowed of my friend,\nattended by a footman, who was a stout fellow, and well armed, I\nmyself being provided with a brace of good pistols, which I was fully\ndetermined to use against any person who should presume to lay violent\nhands upon me, except my lord, for whom a less mortal weapon would have\nsufficed, such as a bodkin or a tinder-box. Nothing could be farther\nfrom my intention than the desire of hurting any living creature, much\nless my husband: my design was only to defend myself from cruelty and\noppression, which I knew, by fatal experience, would infallibly be my\nlot, should he get me into his power. And I thought I had as good a\nright to preserve my happiness, as that which every individual has\nto preserve his life, especially against a set of ruffians, who were\nengaged to rob me of it for a little dirty lucre.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the midst of our journey, the footman came up, and told me I was\ndogged; upon which I looked out, and, seeing a man riding by the chariot\nside, presented one of my pistols out of my window, and preserved that\nposture of defence, until he thought proper to retreat, and rid me of\nthe fears that attended his company. I arrived in town, and, changing\nmy equipage, hired an open chaise, in which, though I was almost starved\nwith cold, I travelled to Reading, which I reached by ten next morning;\nand from thence proceeded farther in the country, with a view of taking\nrefuge with Mrs. C--, who was my particular friend. Here I should\nhave found shelter, though my lord had been beforehand with me, and\nendeavoured to prepossess her against my conduct, had not the house\nbeen crowded with company, among whom I could not possibly have been\nconcealed, especially from her brother, who was an intimate friend of my\npersecutor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThings being thus situated, I enjoyed but a very short interview with\nher, in which her sorrow and perplexity on my account appeared with\ngreat expression in her countenance; and, though it was not in her power\nto afford me the relief I expected, she, in the most genteel manner,\nsent after me a small sum of money, thinking that, considering the hurry\nin which I left my house, I might have occasion for it on the road. I\nwas, by this time, benumbed with cold, fatigued with travelling, and\nalmost fretted to death by my disappointment. However, this was no time\nto indulge despondence; since nobody could or would assist me, I stood\nthe more in need of my own resolution and presence of mind. After some\ndeliberation, I steered my course back to London; and, being unwilling\nto return by the same road in which I came, as well as impatient to be\nat the end of my journey, I chose the Bagshot way, and ventured to cross\nthe heath by moonlight.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere I was attacked by a footpad armed with a broad-sword, who came\nup and demanded my money. My stock amounted to twelve guineas; and I\nforesaw that should I be stripped of the whole sum, I could not travel\nwithout discovering who I was, and consequently running the risk of\nbeing detected by my pursuer. On these considerations, I gave the fellow\nthree guineas and some silver; with which he was so far from being\nsatisfied, that he threatened to search me for more: but I ordered the\ncoachman to proceed, and by good fortune escaped that ceremony, though\nI was under some apprehension of being overtaken with a pistol bullet in\nmy flight, and therefore held down my head in the chaise, in imitation\nof some great men, who are said to have ducked in the same manner in\nthe day of battle. My fears happened to be disappointed: I lay at an inn\nupon the road, and next day arrived in town, in the utmost difficulty\nand distress; for I knew not where to fix my habitation, and was\ndestitute of all means of support. In this dilemma, I applied to my\nlawyer, who recommended me to the house of a tradesman in Westminster,\nwhere I lodged and boarded upon credit, with my faithful Abigail (whom I\nshall distinguish by the name of Mrs. S--), for the space of ten weeks,\nduring which I saw nobody, and never once stirred abroad.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile I was thus harassed out of all enjoyment of life, and reduced\nto the utmost indigence, by the cruelty of my persecutor, who had even\nstripped me of my wearing apparel, I made a conquest of Lord D--,\na nobleman who is now dead, and therefore I shall say little of his\ncharacter, which is perfectly well known: this only will I observe,\nthat, next to my own tyrant, he was the person of whom I had the\ngreatest abhorrence. Nevertheless, when these two came in competition,\nI preferred the offers of this new lover, which were very considerable;\nand as an asylum was the chief thing I wanted, agreed to follow him\nto his country seat, whither I actually sent my clothes, which I had\npurchased upon credit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHowever, upon mature deliberation, I changed my mind, and signified my\nresolution in a letter, desiring at the same time that my baggage might\nbe sent back. In consequence of this message, I expected a visit from\nhim, in all the rage of indignation and disappointment, and gave orders\nthat he should not be admitted into my house yet, notwithstanding this\nprecaution, he found means to procure entrance; and one of the first\nobjects that I saw, next morning, in my bedchamber, was my lover, armed\nwith a horsewhip, against which, from the knowledge of the man, I did\nnot think myself altogether secure; though I was not much alarmed,\nbecause I believed myself superior to him in point of bravery, should\nthe worst come to the worst. But, contrary to my expectation, and his\nusual behaviour to our sex, he accosted me very politely, and began to\nexpostulate on the contents of my letter. I freely told him, that I had\nrashly assented to his proposal, for my own convenience only; that, when\nI reflected on what I had done, I thought it ungenerous in me to live\nwith him upon these terms; and that, as I did not like him, and\ncould not dissemble, such a correspondence could never tend to the\nsatisfaction of either. He allowed the inference was just, though he\nwas very much chagrined at my previous proceeding. He relinquished his\nclaim, restored my clothes, and never afterwards upbraided me with my\nconduct in this affair; though he at one time owned, that he still loved\nme, and ever should, because I had used him ill; a declaration that\nstrongly marks the peculiarity of his character. As for my own part, I\nown that my behaviour on this occasion is no other way excusable, than\non account of the miserable perplexity of my circumstances, which were\noften so calamitous, that I wonder I have not been compelled to take\nsuch steps as would have rendered my conduct much more exceptionable\nthan it really is.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt last all my hopes were blasted by the issue of my suit, which was\ndetermined in favour of my lord. Even then I refused to yield: on the\ncontrary, coming out of retirement, I took lodgings in Suffolk-street,\nand set my tyrant at defiance. But, being unwilling to trust my doors\nto the care of other people, I hired a house in Conduit-street; and no\nsooner appeared in the world again, than I was surrounded by divers and\nsundry sorts of admirers. I believe I received the incense and addresses\nof all kinds under the sun, except that sort which was most to my\nliking, a man capable of contracting and inspiring a mutual attachment;\nbut such a one is equally rare and inestimable; not but that I own\nmyself greatly obliged to all those who cultivated my good graces,\nthough they were very little beholden to me; for where I did not really\nlove, I could never profess that passion; that sort of dissimulation is\na slavery that no honest nature will undergo. Except one worthy young\nman whom I sometimes saw, they were a strange medley of insignificant\nbeings: one was insipid, another ridiculously affected, a third void of\nall education, a fourth altogether inconsistent; and, in short, I found\nas many trifling characters among the men, as ever I observed in my own\nsex. Some of them I endeavoured to bring over to my maxims, while they\nattempted to make a proselyte of me; but, finding the task impracticable\non both sides, we very wisely dropped each other.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt length, however, I was blessed with the acquaintance of one\nnobleman, who is, perhaps, the first character in England, in point\nof honour, integrity, wit, sense, and benevolence; when I have thus\ndistinguished him, I need scarce mention Lord --. This great, this good\nman, possesses every accomplishment requisite to inspire admiration,\nlove, and esteem. With infinitely more merit than almost ever fell to\none man's share, he manifests such diffidence of his own qualifications,\nas cannot fail to prepossess every company in his favour. He seems to\nobserve nothing, yet sees everything; his manner of telling a story,\nand making trifles elegant, is peculiar to himself; and, though he has\na thousand oddities, they serve only to make him more agreeable. After\nwhat I have said, it may be supposed that I was enamoured of his person;\nbut this was not the case; love is altogether capricious and fanciful;\nyet I admire, honour, and esteem him to the highest degree, and when I\nobserve that his character resembled that of my dear departed friend Mr.\nB--; or rather, that Mr. B--, had he lived, would have resembled Lord\n--, I pay the highest compliment I can conceive both to the living and\nto the dead.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this nobleman's friendship and conversation I thought myself happy;\nthough I was, as usual, exposed to the indefatigable efforts of my lord,\nwho, one day, while I was favoured with the company of this generous\nfriend, appeared at my door in his coach, attended by another gentleman,\nwho demanded entrance with an air of authority. A very honest\nfootman, who had been long in my service, ran upstairs in the utmost\nconsternation, and gave me an account of what had happened below. Upon\nwhich I told him he had nothing to answer for, and ordered him to keep\nthe door fast shut against all opposition; though I was so much affected\nwith this unexpected assault, that Lord -- said he was never more\nsurprised and shocked in his life, than at the horror which appeared in\nmy countenance, when I saw the coach stop at my door.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy little hero being refused admittance, went away, threatening to\nreturn speedily with a reinforcement; and during this interval, I\nprovided myself with a soldier, whom I placed sentinel at the door,\nwithin side, to guard me from the danger of such assaults for the\nfuture. My lord, true to his promise, marched back with his auxiliaries,\nreinforced with a constable, and repeated his demand of being admitted;\nand my soldier opening the sash, in order to answer him, according to my\ndirections, he no sooner perceived the red coat, than he was seized with\nsuch a panic, that he instantly fled with great precipitation; and, when\nhe recounted the adventure, like Falstaff in the play, multiplied my\nguard into a whole file of musqueteers. He also made a shift to discover\nthe gentleman who had been so kind as to lend me one of his company, and\ncomplained of him to the duke of N--, in hopes of seeing him broke for\nhis misdemeanour; but in that expectation he was luckily disappointed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerceiving that in England I should never enjoy peace, but be\ncontinually subject to those alarms and disquiets which had already\nimpaired my health and spirits, I resolved to repair again to France,\nmy best refuge and sure retreat from the persecution of my tyrant. Yet,\nbefore I took this step, I endeavoured, by the advice of my friends, to\nconceal myself near Windsor; but was in a little time discovered by my\nlord, and hunted out of my lurking-place accordingly. I then removed\nto Chelsea, where I suffered inconceivable uneasiness and agitation\nof mind, from the nature of my situation, my tranquility being thus\nincessantly invaded by a man who could not be satisfied with me, and yet\ncould not live without me. So that, though I was very much indisposed,\nI set out for France, by way of the Hague, as the war had shut up all\nother communication, having no other attendant but my woman S--, who,\nthough she dreaded the sea, and was upon the brink of matrimony, would\nnot quit me in such a calamitous condition, until I was joined by my\nfootman and another maid, whom I ordered to follow me with the baggage.\nBut, before my departure, I sent a message to Lord --, demanding my\nclothes, which he had seized in Essex; and, he refusing to deliver them,\nI was obliged to equip myself anew, upon credit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was supplied with money for my journey by my good friend L--; and,\nafter a short and pleasant passage, arrived at the Hague, where I\nstayed two months, and parted with S--, on whom I settled an annuity\nof five-and-twenty pounds, payable out of the provision which I had or\nmight obtain from my husband. The same allowance had I prevailed upon\nLord B-- to grant to another maid, who attended me while I lived in his\nhouse.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did not much relish the people in Holland, because they seemed\nentirely devoted to self-interest, without any taste for pleasure or\npoliteness; a species of disposition that could not be very agreeable\nto me, who always despised money, had an unbounded benevolence of\nheart, and loved pleasure beyond every other consideration. When I\nsay pleasure, I would not be understood to mean sensuality, which\nconstitutes the supreme happiness of those only who are void of\nsentiment and imagination. Nevertheless, I received some civilities in\nthis place, and, among the rest, the reputation of having for my lover\nthe king of P--'s minister, who was young and airy, and visited me\noften; circumstances that were sufficient to lay me under the imputation\nof an amour, which I frequently incurred without having given the least\ncause of suspicion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving taken leave of my Dutch friends, I departed from the Hague, in\ncompany with an English woman, whom I had chosen for that purpose, and\narrived at Antwerp with much difficulty and danger, the highway being\ninfested with robbers. After having reposed myself a few days in this\ncity, I hired a coach for myself, and set out with my companion for\nBrussels; but, before we reached Mechlin, our vehicle was attacked by\ntwo hussars, who, with their sabres drawn, obliged the coachman to\ndrive into a wood near the road. I at first imagined that they wanted to\nexamine our passports, but was soon too well convinced of their design;\nand, though very much shocked at the discovery, found resolution enough\nto suppress my concern, so that it should not aggravate the terrors\nof the young woman, who had almost died with apprehension. I even\nencouraged her to hope for the best; and, addressing myself to the\nrobbers in French, begged, in the most suppliant manner, that they\nwould spare our lives; upon which one of them, who was a little fellow,\nassured me, in the same language, that we had nothing to fear for our\npersons.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we were conveyed in a state of dreadful suspense about\nthree-quarters of a mile into the wood, the ruffians came into the\ncoach, and, taking my keys, which I kept ready in my hand for them,\nopened three large trunks that contained my baggage, and emptying them\nof everything but my hoops and a few books, packed up their booty in a\ncloth; then robbed me of my money and jewels, even to my shoe-buckles\nand sleeve-buttons, took my footman's laced hat, and gave it, by way\nof gratification, to a peasant, who came from behind the bushes, and\nassisted them in packing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis affair being despatched, they ordered us to return to the road by\na different way from that in which we were carried into the wood; and\nmounting their horses, rode off with the plunder, though not before\nthe little fellow, who was the least ferocious of the two, had come and\nshaken me by the hand, wishing us a good journey; a compliment which I\nheartily returned, being extremely well pleased with the retreat of two\nsuch companions, who had detained us a whole half-hour; during which,\nnotwithstanding the assurance I had received, I was in continual\napprehension of seeing their operation concluded with the murder of\nus all; for I supposed they were of that gang who had some time before\nmurdered a French officer, and used a lady extremely ill, after having\nrifled her of all she had.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving thus undergone pillage, and being reduced to the extremity\nof indigence in a foreign land, it is not to be supposed that my\nreflections were very comfortable; and yet, though I sustained the whole\ndamage, I was the only person in the company who bore the accident with\nany resolution and presence of mind. My coachman and valet seemed quite\npetrified with fear; and it was not till I had repeated my directions\nthat the former drove farther into the wood, and took the first turning\nto the right, in order to regain the road, according to the command of\nthe robbers, which I did not choose to disobey.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis misfortune I suffered by the misinformation I received at Antwerp,\nwhere I would have provided myself with an escort, had not I been\nassured that there was not the least occasion to put myself to such\nextraordinary expense. And, indeed, the robbers took the only half-hour\nin which they could have had an opportunity of plundering us; for we no\nsooner returned into the highway, than we met with the French artillery\ncoming from Brussels, which was a security to us during the rest of our\njourney. We were afterwards informed at a small village, that there was\nactually a large gang of deserters, who harboured in that wood, from\nwhich they made excursions in the neighbourhood, and kept the peasants\nin continual alarms.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving proceeded a little way, we were stopped by the artillery\ncrossing a bridge; and, as the train was very long, must have been\ndetained till night, had not a soldier informed me, that, if I would\ntake the trouble to come out of my coach, and apply to the commandant,\nhe would order them to halt, and allow me to pass. I took the man's\nadvice, and was by him conducted, with much difficulty, through the\ncrowd, to some officers, who seemed scarce to deserve the name; for,\nwhen I signified my request, they neither rose up, nor desired me to sit\ndown; but, lolling in their chairs, with one leg stretched out, asked,\nwith an air of disrespectful raillery where I was going; and when I\nanswered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo Paris,\u00e2\u0080\u009d desired to know what I would do there.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI, who am naturally civil where I am civilly used, and saucy enough\nwhere I think myself treated with disregard, was very much piqued at\ntheir insolent and unmannerly behaviour, and began to reply to the\nimpertinent questions very abruptly; so that a very tart dialogue would\nhave ensued, had not the conversation been interrupted by a tall, thin,\ngenteel young French nobleman, an officer in the army, who, chancing\nto come in, asked with great politeness, what I would please to have. I\nthen repeated my desire, and produced my passports, by which he learned\nwho I was. He immediately gave orders that my coach should pass; and\nafterwards visited me at Paris, having obtained my permission, and\ntaken my address at parting; while the others, understanding my name and\nquality, asked pardon for their impolite carriage, which they told\nme was owing to the representation of the soldier, who gave them to\nunderstand that I was a strolling actress.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI could not help laughing heartily at this mistake, which might have\nproceeded from the circumstances of my appearance, my footman having\nbeen obliged to change hats with the peasant, and myself being without\nbuckles on my shoes and buttons on my riding-skirt, while my countenance\nstill retained marks of the fear and confusion I had undergone. After\nall, perhaps the fellow was a droll, and wanted to entertain himself at\nmy expense. The day was so far consumed in these adventures, that I was\nobliged to take up my lodgings at Mechlin, where I addressed myself to\nthe intendant, giving him an account of the disaster I had met with, and\ndesiring I might have credit at the inn, as our whole company could not\nraise the value of a sixpence. This gentleman, though a provincial, was\npolite in his way, and not only granted my request, but invited me to\nlodge at his own house. I accordingly gave him my company at supper, but\ndid not choose to sleep at his quarters, because he appeared to be what\nthe French call un vieux debauche.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNext day, he sent a trumpet to the general, with a detail of my\nmisfortune, in hopes of retrieving what I had lost; but, notwithstanding\nall possible search, I was fain to put up with my damage, which, in\nlinen, laces, clothes, and baubles, amounted to upwards of seven hundred\npounds, a loss which never deprived me of one moment's rest; for, though\nI lodged at a miserable inn, and lay in a paltry bed, I slept as sound\nas if nothing extraordinary had happened, after I had written to London\nand Paris, directing that the payment of my bills of credit might\nbe stopped. Indeed, I know of but two misfortunes in life capable of\ndepressing my spirits, namely, the loss of health and friends; all\nothers may be prevented or endured. The articles of that calamity which\nI chiefly regretted, were a picture of Lord W--, and some inimitable\nletters from Mr. B--.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom Mechlin I proceeded to Brussels, where, being known, I got credit\nfor some necessaries, and borrowed twenty guineas to defray the expense\nof my journey to Paris. Having consulted with my friends about the\nsafest method of travelling through Flanders, I was persuaded to take\nplaces in the public voiture; and accordingly departed, not without\nfears of finding one part of the country as much infested with robbers\nas another. Nor were these apprehensions assuaged by the conversation\nof my fellow-travellers, who, being of the lower sort of people, that\ndelight in exaggerating dangers, entertained me all the way with an\naccount of all the robberies and murders which had been committed on\nthat road, with many additional circumstances of their own invention.\nAfter having been two days exposed to this comfortable conversation,\namong very disagreeable company, which is certainly one of the most\ndisagreeable situations in life, I arrived at Lisle, where, thinking the\ndangerous part of the journey was now past, I hired a post-chaise, and\nin two days more reached Paris without any further molestation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon my arrival in the capital, I was immediately visited by my old\nacquaintances, who, hearing my disaster, offered me their clothes, and\ninsisted upon my wearing them, until I could be otherwise provided. They\nlikewise engaged me in parties, with a view of amusing my imagination,\nthat I might not grow melancholy in reflecting upon my loss; and desired\nme to repeat the particulars of my story forty times over, expressing\ngreat surprise at our not being murdered, or ravished at least. As for\nthis last species of outrage, the fear of it never once entered my head,\notherwise I should have been more shocked and alarmed than I really\nwas. But it seems this was the chief circumstance of my companion's\napprehension; and I cannot help observing, that a homely woman is always\nmore apt to entertain those fears, than one whose person exposes her to\nmuch more imminent danger. However, I now learned, that the risk I\nran was much greater than I imagined it to be, those ruffians being\nfamiliarized to rape as well as murder.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSoon after my appearance at Paris, I was favoured with the addresses\nof several French lovers; but I never had any taste for foreigners, or\nindeed for any amusement of that kind, except such as were likely to be\nlasting, and settled upon a more agreeable footing than that of common\ngallantry. When I deviated from this principle, my conduct was the\neffect of compulsion, and therefore I was never easy under it, having\nbeen reduced to the alternative of two evils, the least of which I was\nobliged to choose, as a man leaps into the sea, in order to escape from\na ship that is on fire.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThough I rejected their love, I did not refuse their company and\nconversation; and, though my health was considerably impaired by the\nshock I received in my last adventure, which was considerably greater\nthan I at first imagined, and affected my companion so much, that she\ndid not recover her spirits till she returned to England, I say,\nthough I was for some time a valetudinarian, I enjoyed myself in great\ntranquility for the space of ten months, during which I was visited\nby English, Scotch, and French, of all parties and persuasions; for\npleasure is of no faction, and that was the chief object of my pursuit;\nneither was I so ambitious of being a politician, as to employ my time\nand thoughts upon subjects which I did not understand. I had admirers of\nall sides, and should have spent my time very much to my liking, had not\nI felt my funds sensibly diminish, without any prospect of their being\nrepaired; for I had been obliged to lay out a great part of the sum\nallotted for my subsistence, in supplying my companion, my servant, and\nmyself with necessaries, in lieu of those which we had lost.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving before my eyes the uncomfortable prospect of wanting money in\na strange place, I found myself under the necessity of returning to\nEngland, where I had more resources than I could possibly have among\nforeigners; and with that view wrote to Lord --'s agents, desiring that\nI might be enabled to discharge my obligations at Paris, by the payment\nof my pin-money. Thus a negotiation commenced, and his lordship promised\nto remit money for the clearance of my Paris debts, which amounted to\nfour hundred pounds: but he would not advance one farthing more, though\nI gave him to understand, that, while he protracted the agreement, I\nmust inevitably be adding to my encumbrances, and that I should be\nas effectually detained by a debt of twenty pounds, as if I owed a\nthousand. Notwithstanding all my representations, he would not part with\none shilling over the net sum which I at first stipulated; so that\nall my measures were rendered abortive, and I found it altogether\nimpracticable to execute those resolutions I had formed in his favour.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThus did he for a mere trifle embarrass the woman for whom he professed\nthe most unlimited love, and whose principles he pretended to hold in\nthe utmost veneration. Indeed, his confidence in my integrity was not\nwithout foundation; for many wives, with one half of my provocation,\nwould have ruined him to all intents and purposes; whereas,\nnotwithstanding all the extraordinary expenses to which I had been\nexposed by his continual persecution, he never paid a shilling on my\naccount except one thousand pounds, exclusive of the small allowance\nwhich was my due. In a word, so much time elapsed before my lord could\nprevail upon himself to advance the bare four hundred, that I was\ninvolved in fresh difficulties, from which I found it impossible to\nextricate myself; and though I had occasion to write a letter to my\nbenefactor Lord --, in which I expressed my acknowledgment of past\nfavours, I could not venture to solicit more, even when I was encouraged\nby a very obliging answer, wherein he declared, that the good qualities\nof my mind and heart would bind him to me in friendship for ever.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile I ruminated on my uncomfortable situation, which would neither\npermit me to return to England, nor to stay much longer where I was, a\nyoung Englishman of immense fortune took Paris in his way from Italy,\naccompanied by a most agreeable Scotchman of very good sense and great\nvivacity. It was my good or ill fortune to become acquainted with these\ngentlemen, who, having seen me at the opera, expressed a desire of being\nknown to me, and accordingly favoured me with a visit one afternoon,\nwhen the brisk North Briton engrossed the whole conversation, while\nthe other seemed fearful and diffident even to a degree of bashfulness,\nthrough which, however, I could discern a delicate sensibility and\nuncommon understanding. There was in his person, which was very\nagreeable, as well as in his behaviour, a certain naivete that was very\npleasing; and, at this first interview, we relished each other's company\nso well, that a sort of intimacy immediately commenced, and was carried\non in a succession of parties of pleasure, in the course of which I\nfound him fraught with all the tenderness and sentiment that render\nthe heart susceptible of the most refined love; a disposition that\nimmediately made me partial to him, while it subjected his own heart to\nall the violent impressions of a passion, which I little imagined our\ncorrespondence would have produced.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNevertheless, I was far from being displeased with my conquest, because\nhis person and qualifications, as well as his manner of address, were\nvery much to my liking, and recommended him in a particular manner to\nmy affection. Indeed, he made greater progress in my heart than I myself\nsuspected; for there was something congenial in our souls, which, from\nour first meeting, I believe, had attracted us, unknown to ourselves,\nunder the notions of friendship and regard, and now disclosed itself in\nthe most passionate love.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI listened to his addresses, and we were truly happy. His attachment\nwas the quintessence of tenderness and sincerity, while his generosity\nknew no bounds. Not contented with having paid twelve hundred pounds on\nmy account, in the space of one fortnight, he would have loaded me\nwith present after present, had I not absolutely refused to accept\nsuch expensive marks of his munificence. I was even mortified at those\ninstances of his liberality, which my situation compelled me to receive,\nlest, being but little acquainted with my disposition, he should suspect\nme of being interested in my love, and judge my conduct by the malicious\nreports of common fame, which, he afterwards owned, had at first\nobtained such credit with him, that he believed our mutual attachment\nwould not be of long duration. But, in this particular, he was soon\nundeceived. His heart, though naturally adapted for the melting passion,\nhad hitherto escaped untouched by all the ladies of Italy and France;\nand, therefore, the first impressions were the more deeply fixed. As he\nwas unpractised in the ways of common gallantry and deceit, the striking\nsimplicity in his character was the more likely to engage the heart of\none who knew the perfidy of the world, and despised all the farce and\nbombast of fashionable profession, which I had always considered as the\nphrase of vanity and ostentation, rather than the genuine language\nof love. Besides, gratitude had a considerable share in augmenting my\naffection, which manifested itself in such a warm, cordial, artless\nmanner, as increased his esteem, and riveted his attachment; for he\ncould easily perceive, from the whole tenor of my conduct, that my\nbreast was an utter stranger to craft and dissimulation; yet I was at\nfirst fearful of contracting any engagement with him, because, being\nyounger than me, he might be more apt to change, and the world might be\nmalicious enough to suppose I had practised upon his inexperience; but,\nconscious of my own integrity, I set slander at defiance, trusting to my\nown behaviour, and his natural probity, for the continuance of his love.\nThough we did not live together in the same house, the greatest part of\nour time was spent in each other's company; we dined and supped at the\nsame table, frequented public places, went upon parties to the country,\nand never parted, but for a few hours in the night, which we passed in\nthe utmost impatience to meet again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this agreeable manner did the days roll on, when my felicity was\ninterrupted by a fit of jealousy with which I happened to be seized. I\nhad contracted an acquaintance with a young married lady, who, though\nher personal attractions were but slender, was upon the whole an\nagreeable, cheerful, good-natured companion, with a little dash of\nthe coquette in her composition. This woman being in very indigent\ncircumstances, occasioned by some losses her husband had sustained, no\nsooner had an opportunity of seeing and conversing with my lover,\nthan she formed the design of making a conquest of him. I should have\nforgiven her for this scheme, whatever pangs it might have cost me, had\nI believed it the effect of real passion; but I knew her too well to\nsuppose her heart was susceptible of love, and accordingly resented it.\nIn the execution of her plan, she neglected nothing which she thought\ncapable of engaging his attention. She took all opportunities of sitting\nnear him at table, ogled him in the most palpable manner, directed her\nwhole discourse to him, trod upon his toes; nay, I believe, squeezed his\nhand. My blood boiled at her, though my pride, for some time, enabled\nme to conceal my uneasiness; till at length her behaviour became so\narrogant and gross, that I could no longer suppress my indignation,\nand one day told my lover that I would immediately renounce his\ncorrespondence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was greatly alarmed at this unexpected declaration; and, when he\nunderstood the cause of it, assured me, that, for the future, he would\nnever exchange one word with her. Satisfied with this mark of his\nsincerity and regard, I released him from his promise, which he\ncould not possibly keep, while she and I lived upon any terms; and we\ncontinued to visit each other as usual, though she still persisted in\nher endeavours to rival me in his affection, and contracted an intimacy\nwith his companion, who seemed to entertain a passion for her, that she\nmight have the more frequent opportunities of being among us; for she\nhad no objection against favouring the addresses of both. One evening,\nI remember, we set out in my coach for the opera; and, in the way,\nthis inamorata was so busy with her feet, that I was incensed at her\nbehaviour; and, when we arrived at the place, refused to alight; but,\nsetting them down, declared my intention of returning home immediately.\nShe was so much pleased with this intimation, that she could not conceal\nthe joy she felt at the thoughts of conversing with him, uninterrupted\nby my presence; an opportunity with which I had never favoured her\nbefore. This open exultation increased my anger and anxiety. I went\nhome; but, being still tortured with the reflection of having left them\ntogether, adjusted myself in the glass, though I was too angry to take\nnotice of my own figure, and without further delay returned to the\nopera.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving inquired for the box in which they sat, I took possession of one\nthat fronted them, and, reconnoitring them, without being perceived, had\nthe satisfaction of seeing him removed to as great a distance from her\nas the place would permit, and his head turned another way. Composed by\nthis examination, I joined them without further scruple, when my young\ngentleman expressed great joy at my appearance, and told me he was\ndetermined to have left the entertainment, and come in quest of me, had\nI not returned at that instant.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn our way homewards, my rival repeated her usual hints, and with her\nlarge hoop almost overshadowed my lover from my view; upon which my\njealousy and wrath recurred with such violence, that I pulled the string\nas a signal for the coachman to stop, with a view of getting out, and\ngoing home afoot; a step which would have afforded a new spectacle to\nthe people of Paris. But I reflected in a moment upon the folly of such\na resolution, and soon recollected myself, by calling my pride to my\nassistance. I determined, however, that she should act no more scenes of\nthis kind in my presence, and that same night insisted upon my lover's\ndropping all intercourse and connection with this tormentor. He very\ncheerfully complied with my desire, and was even glad of an occasion to\nbreak off his acquaintance with a person about whom I had plagued him so\nmuch.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThus was I freed from the persecution of one of those creatures,\nwho, though of little consequence in themselves, are yet the pests of\nsociety, and find means to destroy that harmony which reigns between two\nlovers, by the intrusion of a loose appetite, void of all sensibility\nand discretion; having no feelings themselves, they cannot sympathize\nwith those of other people; and do mischief out of mere wantonness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lover being obliged to go to England, had settled me in a genteel\nhouse in Paris, with a view of returning when his affairs should be\nadjusted; but, when the time of his departure approached, he began to\nbe uneasy at the prospect of separation, and, in order to alleviate his\nanxiety, desired me to accompany him to Calais, where we stayed together\nthree or four days, during which the dread of parting became more and\nmore intense; so that we determined upon my following him into England\nat the first opportunity, where I should live altogether incog. that\nI might be concealed from the inquiries and attempts of my lord. Even\nafter this resolution was fixed, we parted with all the agonies of\nlovers who despair of ever meeting again; and the wind blowing very high\nafter he had embarked, increased my fears. But, by the return of the\npacket-boat I was blessed with the report of his being safe arrived in\nEngland, and had the satisfaction of perusing his letters by every post.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy admirer being thus detached from me, my thoughts were entirely\nemployed in concerting some private method of conveying myself to him.\nAs I would not trust myself in the common packet, for fear of being\ndiscovered, after having revolved divers schemes, I determined to\ntransport myself in one of the Dutch fishing-boats, though I knew the\npassage would be hazardous; but, in a case of such interesting concern,\nI overlooked all danger and inconvenience. Before I put this resolution\nin practice, I was so fortunate as to hear of a small English vessel,\nthat arrived in Calais with a prisoner of war, in which I embarked,\nwith my companion and another lady, who lived with me for some time\nafterwards; and, when we came on board, discovered that the ship was no\nother than a light collier, and that her whole company amounted to no\nmore than three men. Nevertheless, though the sea was so rough, and the\nweather so unpromising, that no other boat would venture to put to sea,\nwe set sail, and, between two storms, in about three hours arrived in\nsafety in Dover.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom hence my first companion went to her friends in the stage-coach,\nwhile the other lady and I hired an open post-chaise, though it snowed\nvery hard, and, without any accident, performed our journey to London,\nwhere I met with my lover, who flew to my arms in all the transports\nof impatient joy; and, doubtless, I deserved his affection for the\nhardships, perils, and difficulties I had undergone to be with him;\nfor I never scrupled to undertake anything practicable, in order to\ndemonstrate the sincerity of what I professed. In consequence of our\nplan, I assumed a fictitious name, and never appeared in public, being\nfully satisfied and happy in the company and conversation of the man\nI loved; and, when he went into the country, contented myself with his\ncorrespondence, which he punctually maintained, in a series of letters,\nequally sensible, sincere, and affectionate.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon his return to town for the remainder of the season, he devoted\nthe greatest part of his time to our mutual enjoyment; left me with\nreluctance, when he was called away by indispensable business, and the\ncivility which was due to his acquaintance, and very seldom went to any\nplace of public entertainment, because I could not accompany and share\nwith him in the diversion; nay, so much did I engross his attention,\nthat one evening, after he had been teased into an agreement of meeting\nsome friends at a play, he went thither precisely at the appointed hour,\nand, as they did not arrive punctually at the very minute, he returned\nto me immediately, as much rejoiced at his escape as if he had met with\nsome signal deliverance. Nor was his constancy inferior to the ardour\nof his love. We went once together to a ball in the Haymarket, where,\nin the midst of a thousand fine women, whose charms were enhanced by the\npeculiarity of the dresses they wore, he remained unshaken, unseduced,\npreserving his attachment for me in spite of all temptation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the summer, he provided me with a house in the neighbourhood of his\nown; but the accommodations being bad, and that country affording no\nother place fit for my residence, he brought me home to his own seat,\nand, by that step, raised such a universal clamour; though I saw no\ncompany, and led such a solitary life, that nothing but excessive love\ncould have supported my spirits. Not but that he gave me as much of his\ntime as he could possibly spare from the necessary duties of paying and\nreceiving visits, together with the avocations of hunting, and other\ncountry amusements, which I could not partake. Formerly, indeed, I used\nto hunt and shoot, but I had left off both, so that I was now reduced to\nthe alternative of reading and walking by myself; but love made up for\nall deficiencies to me, who think nothing else worth the living for. Had\nI been blessed with a partner for life, who could have loved sincerely,\nand inspired me with a mutual flame, I would have asked no more of fate.\nInterest and ambition have no share in my composition; love, which is\npleasure, or pleasure, which is love, makes up the whole. A heart so\ndisposed cannot be devoid of other good qualities; it must be subject\nto the impressions of humanity and benevolence, and enemy to nothing but\nitself. This you will give me leave to affirm, in justice to myself, as\nI have frankly owned my failings and misconduct.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTowards the end of summer, my heart was a little alarmed by a report\nthat prevailed, of my lover's being actually engaged in a treaty of\nmarriage; however, I gave little credit to this rumour till I was\nobliged to go to town about business, and there I heard the same\ninformation confidently affirmed. Though I still considered it as a\nvague surmise, I wrote to him an account of what I had heard; and,\nin his answer, which is still in my possession, he assured me, with\nrepeated vows and protestations, that the report was altogether false.\nSatisfied with this declaration, I returned to his house; and, though\nthe tale was incessantly thundered in my ears, still believed it void of\nall foundation, till my suspicion was awakened by a very inconsiderable\ncircumstance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne day, on his return from hunting, I perceived he had a very fine\npair of Dresden ruffles on his shirt, which I could not suppose he would\nwear at such a rustic exercise; and, therefore, my fears took the alarm.\nWhen I questioned him about this particular of his dress, his colour\nchanged; and though he attempted to elude my suspicion, by imputing\nit to a mistake of his servant, I could not rest satisfied with this\naccount of the matter, but inquired into the truth with such eagerness\nand penetration, that he could not deny he had been to make a visit.\nBy degrees, I even extorted from him a confession, that he had engaged\nhimself further than he ought to have proceeded, without making me\nacquainted with his design, though he endeavoured to excuse his conduct,\nand pacify my displeasure, by saying, that the affair would not be\nbrought to bear for a great while, and, perhaps, might never come to a\ndetermination but he was in great confusion, and, indeed, hardly knew\nwhat he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would have quitted his house that moment, had not he beforehand\nobtained a promise that I would take no rash resolution of that kind,\nand put it out of my power to procure any method of conveyance by\nwhich I could make my retreat. I gave no vent to reproaches, but only\nupbraided him with his having permitted me to return, in ignorance, to\nthe country, after I was once fairly gone; upon which he swore that he\ncould not bear the thoughts of parting with me. This declaration was a\nmystery at that time, but I have been since so fully satisfied of his\nreasons for his conduct, that I heartily acquit him of all injustice\nto me. And, indeed, it is my sincere opinion, that, if ever young man\ndeserved to be happy, he is certainly entitled to that privilege;\nand, if I may be allowed to judge, has a heart susceptible of the most\nrefined enjoyment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe violence of the grief and consternation which I suffered from this\nstroke having a little subsided, I deliberated with myself about the\nmeasures I should take, and determined to leave his house some day when\nhe should be abroad. I was encouraged in this resolution by the advice\nof our Scotch friend, who came about this time from London, on a visit\nto his fellow-traveller. We thought such an abrupt departure would be\nless shocking than to stay and take a formal leave of my lover, whose\nheart was of such a delicate frame, that, after I told him I should one\nday withdraw myself in his absence, he never came home from the chase,\nor any other avocation, without trembling with apprehension that I had\nescaped.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter he had been some time accustomed to these fears by my previous\nintimation, I at length decamped in good earnest, though my heart\nached upon the occasion, because I left him loving and beloved; for\nhis affection was evident, notwithstanding the step he had taken by the\nadvice and importunity of all his relations, who laid a disagreeable\nrestraint upon his inclinations, while they consulted his interest in\nevery other particular.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile I halted in the next great town, until I could be supplied\nwith fresh horses, I was visited by a gentleman who had been formerly\nintimate with my lover; but a breach had happened in their friendship,\nand he now came to complain of the treatment he had received. Perceiving\nthat I was not in a humour to listen to his story, he shifted the\nconversation to my own, and observed, that I had been extremely\nill-used. I told him that I was of a different opinion; that it was not\nonly just, but expedient, that a young man of Mr. --'s fortune should\nthink of making some alliance to strengthen and support the interest of\nhis family; and that I had nothing to accuse him of but his letting\nme remain so long in ignorance of his intention. He then gave me to\nunderstand, that I was still ignorant of a great part of the ill-usage I\nhad received; affirming, that, while I lived in his house, he had amused\nhimself with all the common women in that town, to some of whom this\ngentleman had personally introduced him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt first, I could not believe this imputation; but he supported his\nassertion with so many convincing circumstances, that I could no longer\ndoubt the truth of them; and I felt so much resentment, that my love\nvanished immediately into air. Instead of proceeding on my journey to\nLondon, I went back a considerable way, and sent a message desiring to\nsee him in a little house, about midway between his own habitation and\nthe town from whence I came. He obeyed my summons, and appeared at\nthe place appointed, where I reproached him with great bitterness.\nHe pleaded guilty to the charge, so far as acknowledging that he had\ncorresponded with other women lately, in order to get the better of his\naffection for me, but the experiment had failed, and he found that he\nshould be for ever miserable.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did not look upon this candid confession as a sufficient atonement\nfor his past dissimulation, and, in the sharpness of my revenge,\ndemanded a settlement, which he peremptorily refused; so that for the\npresent we held each other in the utmost contempt. Indeed, I afterwards\ndespised myself for my condescension, which was owing to the advice\nof my companion, supported and inflamed by the spirit of resentment.\nNevertheless, he begged that I would return to his house, or stay all\nnight where I was; but I was deaf to his entreaties, and, after a great\ndeal of ironical civility on my side, I took my leave, and went away;\nyet, before I set out, I looked back, and saw him on horseback, with\nsuch an air of simplicity and truth, as called up a profound sigh,\nnotwithstanding all that had passed in our conversation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon my arrival in London, I took lodgings in Leicester-fields, and\nanswered a letter which I had some months before received from my lord,\ntelling him that I would go home to him, without stipulating for any\nterms, to try what effect my confidence would have upon his generosity.\nHe readily embraced the offer, and took a house in St. James's-street,\nwhere I proposed to comply with his humour in everything that was\nconsistent with my own peace and tranquility.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMeanwhile, my lover passed his time very disagreeably in the country,\nwith his friend, of whom, it seems, he had conceived some jealousy,\nwhich was increased by a letter I wrote to that gentleman, till he was\nmade acquainted with the contents, which he read over forty times; and\nthen his passion breaking out with more violence than ever, he not only\nexpressed his feeling, in an epistle which I immediately received, but\nwhen he came to town suffered such agonies of despair as I had never\nseen before, except in Lord B--. It was then in my power to have taken\nample revenge upon him, as well as upon my insolent rival, who had\ninsisted upon my leaving his house in a very abrupt manner, though he\nabsolutely refused to gratify her malice, for he was now disposed to\ndo anything for my satisfaction. But I knew his worth, and had too much\nregard for his reputation to advise him to act inconsistent with his\nhonour.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout this time, many tender feelings and sorrowful partings happened\nbetween us, till the marriage knot was tied, when he sent me a bank-note\nfor a thousand pounds, by way of specimen, as he called it, of his\nfriendship, and of what he would do for me, should I ever want his\nassistance. This mark of his generosity I received in a most tender\nbillet, which I shall never part with, together with his picture set in\ndiamonds.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI now employed my thoughts in keeping measures with my lord; we lay\nin the same apartment, and for the first four or five months I neither\ndined nor supped abroad above twice; and then he knew where I was, and\napproved of my company. But all this complacency and circumspection had\nno effect upon his temper, which remained as capricious and dissatisfied\nas ever. Nay, to such a provoking degree did this unhappy humour\nprevail, that one day, in the presence of his lawyer, he harangued upon\nmy misconduct since our last reunion; and very freely affirmed, that\nevery step I had taken was diametrically opposite to his will.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cConscious of the pains I had been at to please him, I was so incensed\nat these unjust invectives, that, starting up, I told him he was a\nlittle dirty fellow; and would have left the house immediately, had not\nhis lawyer, and others, who were in the room, interposed, and by dint of\nargument and importunity diverted me from my purpose. By the bye, I have\nbeen informed by a person of rank, that my lord discovered exactly the\nsame disposition in his father's lifetime, and only changed the subject\nof his complaint from the word father to that of wife. Indeed, he takes\nall opportunities of plaguing my dear parent, as he has just sagacity\nenough to know, that this is the most effectual way he can take to\ndistress me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter repeated trials, I have given up all hopes of making him happy,\nor of finding myself easy in my situation, and live with him at present\nto avoid a greater inconvenience. Not that his ill-nature is all the\ngrievance of which I complain; exclusive of the personal disgust I\nentertain for him, his folly is of that species which disobliges rather\nthan diverts, and his vanity and affectation altogether intolerable;\nfor he actually believes himself, or at least would impose himself upon\nmankind, as a pattern of gallantry and taste; and, in point of business.\na person of infinite sagacity and penetration. But the most ridiculous\npart of his character is his pretended talent for politics, in which he\nso deeply concerns himself, that he has dismissed many a good servant,\nbecause he suspected him of having wrong connections; a theme upon which\nhe has often quarrelled with me, even almost to parting, accusing me\nwith holding correspondence with the earls of B-- and C--, and Mr.\nH-- V--, though I never had the least acquaintance with any of these\ngentlemen, except the earl of C--, to whom I have not spoken these ten\nyears past.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn short, I have often been at a loss to know, whether he was more mad\nand malicious in those fits of enthusiasm, wherein he seemed transported\nwith zeal for the commonwealth, and tormented me with his admonitions\nout of all temper and patience. At length, however, I contrived an\nexpedient which freed me from these troublesome expostulations, and\nsilenced him effectually on the score of politics. This was no other\nthan an open avowal of being connected with all those people whom I have\nnamed. Indeed, I knew him too well to believe there was anything solid\nin his intention or professions, even when he carried himself so far\nas to demand a private audience of the k--, in order to communicate a\nscheme for suppressing the rebellion; and that being denied, solicited\nthe duke of D--'s interest, for permission to raise and head a regiment\nof Kentish smugglers. Nay, to such a pitch did his loyalty soar, that he\npurchased a firelock of particular mechanism, calculated for the safety\nof the bearer, in case he had been placed sentinel at his Majesty's\ndoor, and kept his horses ready caparisoned, with a view of attending\nhis sovereign to the field. Notwithstanding all these pompous\npreparations, had he been put to the proof, he would have infallibly\ncrept out of his engagements, through some sneaking evasion, his\nimagination being very fertile in such saving pretences. Yet he will\ntalk sometimes so fervently, and even sensibly, on the subject, that a\nstranger would mistake him for a man of understanding, and determined\nzeal for the good of his country.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSince my last return to his house, that act of parliament passed, by\nwhich he was enabled to pay his debts, and, among the rest, a thousand\npounds of my contracting, the only burden of that kind I ever entailed\nupon him, exclusive of my pin-money, which was never regularly paid; nor\nwould he have been subject to this, had he not, by his persecution and\npursuit, exposed me to an extraordinary expense. I have also had it\nin my power to reward some of my faithful Abigails; in particular,\nto relieve from extreme distress that maid to whom, as I have already\nobserved, Lord B-- granted an annuity, which she had sold: so that she\nwas reduced to the most abject poverty; and I found her in a dismal\nhole, with two infants perishing for want; a spectacle which drew tears\nfrom my eyes, and indeed could not but make deep impression upon a heart\nlike mine, which the misery of my fellow-creatures never failed to melt.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNor did I upon this occasion forget the attachment and fidelity of my\nother woman Mrs. S--, who, hearing I was robbed in my passage through\nFlanders, had generously relinquished the allowance I had settled upon\nher at parting. The exercise of such acts of humanity and benevolence,\nand the pleasure of seeing my dear and tender parent often, in\nsome measure alleviate the chagrin to which I am subject from the\ndisagreeable disposition of my lord, who, consistent with his former\ninconsistency, upon our last reconciliation, cheerfully agreed to a\nproposal I made of having concerts in the house, and even approved of\nthe scheme with marks of particular satisfaction. But, before one half\nof the winter was expired, he found means to banish all the company,\nbeginning with Lord R-- B--, who, as he walked up-stairs one evening,\nwas stopped by a footman, who plainly told him he had orders to say to\nhim in particular, that his lordship was not at home; yet the very next\nday, perceiving that nobleman and me walking together in the park, he\njoins us with an air of alacrity, as if no such thing had happened,\nand even behaved to Lord R-- with the most fawning complaisance.\nHis deportment was equally absurd and impertinent to the rest of his\nfriends, who forsook us gradually, being tired of maintaining any\nfriendly communication with such a disagreeable composition of ignorance\nand arrogance. For my own part, I look upon him as utterly incorrigible;\nand, as fate has subjected me to his power, endeavour to make the\nbitter draught go down, by detaching myself as much as possible from the\nsupposition that there is any such existence upon earth. Indeed, if I\nhad not fatal experience to the contrary, I should be apt to believe\nthat such a character is not to be found among the sons of men; because\nhis conduct is altogether unaccountable by the known rules and maxims of\nlife, and falls entirely under the poet's observation, when he says,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c'Tis true, no meaning puzzles more than wit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHer ladyship having thus concluded her story, to the entertainment\nof the company, and the admiration of Peregrine, who expressed his\nastonishment at the variety of adventures she had undergone, which\nwas such as he thought sufficient to destroy the most hardy and robust\nconstitution, and therefore infinitely more than enough to overwhelm one\nof her delicate frame; one of the gentlemen present roundly taxed her\nwith want of candour, in suppressing some circumstances of her life,\nwhich he thought essential in the consideration of her character.\n\nShe reddened at this peremptory charge, which had an evident effect upon\nthe countenances of the whole audience, when the accuser proceeded\nto explain his imputation, by observing, that, in the course of her\nnarration, she had omitted to mention a thousand acts of uncommon\ncharity, of which he himself knew her to be guilty; and that she had\nconcealed a great many advantageous proposals of marriage, which she\nmight have accepted before she was engaged.\n\nThe company were agreeably undeceived by this explanation; which her\nladyship acknowledged in very polite terms, as a compliment equally\ngenteel and unexpected. And our hero, after having testified the sense\nhe had of her complaisance and condescension, in regaling him with a\nmark of her confidence and esteem, took his leave, and went home in a\nstate of confusion and perplexity; for, from the circumstances of the\ntale he had heard, he plainly perceived, that her ladyship's heart\nwas too delicate to receive such incense as he, in the capacity of an\nadmirer, could at present pay; because, though he had in some measure\nabridged the empire of Emilia in his own breast, it was not in his own\npower to restrain it so effectually, but that it would interfere with\nany other sovereign whom his thoughts should adopt; and unless Lady --\ncould engross his whole love, time, and attention, he foresaw that it\nwould be impossible for him to support the passion which he might have\nthe good fortune to inspire. He was, moreover, deterred from declaring\nhis love, by the fate of her former admirers, who seemed to have been\nwound up to a degree of enthusiasm, that looked more like the effect of\nenchantment, than the inspiration of human attractions; an ecstasy of\npassion which he durst not venture to undergo. He, therefore, resolved\nto combat with the impressions he had already received, and, if\npossible, cultivate her friendship without soliciting her affection.\nBut, before he could fix upon this determination, he desired to know the\nfooting on which he stood in her opinion; and, by the intelligence of\nCrabtree, obtained in the usual manner, understood that her sentiments\nof him were very favourable, though without the least tincture of love.\nHe would have been transported with joy, had her thoughts of him been\nof a more tender texture; though his reason was better pleased with\nthe information he received; in consequence of which he mustered up the\nideas of his first passion, and set them in opposition to those of this\nnew and dangerous attachment; by which means he kept the balance in\nequilibrio, and his bosom tolerably quiet.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXII.\n\n\n\nHe persuades Cadwallader to assume the Character of a Magician, in\nwhich he acquires a great Share of Reputation, by his Responses to three\nFemales of Distinction, who severally consult the Researches of his Art.\n\n\nHis heart being thus, as it were, suspended between two objects that\nlessened the force of each other's attraction, he took this opportunity\nof enjoying some respite, and for the present detached his sentiments\nfrom both, resolving to indulge himself in the exercise of that\npractical satire which was so agreeable and peculiar in his disposition.\nIn this laudable determination he was confirmed by the repeated\nsuggestions of his friend Cadwallader, who taxed him with letting his\ntalents rust in indolence, and stimulated his natural vivacity with a\nsuccession of fresh discoveries in the world of scandal.\n\nPeregrine was now seized with a strange whim, and when he communicated\nthe conceit to Cadwallader, it in a moment acquired his approbation.\nThis notion he imparted in a proposal to subject the town to their\nridicule, by giving responses to the character of a professed conjurer,\nto be personated by the old misanthrope, whose aspect was extremely well\ncalculated for the purpose. The plan was immediately adjusted in all its\nparts; an apartment hired in a house accommodated with a public stair,\nso that people might have free ingress and egress, without being exposed\nto observation; and, this tenement being furnished with the apparatus of\na magician, such as globes, telescopes, a magic-lanthorn, a skeleton, a\ndried monkey together with the skins of an alligator, otter, and\nsnake, the conjurer himself took possession of his castle, after having\ndistributed printed advertisements containing the particulars of his\nundertaking.\n\nThese bills soon operated according to the wish of the projectors. As\nthe price of the oracle was fixed at half a guinea, the public naturally\nconcluded that the author was no common fortune-teller; and, the very\nnext day, Peregrine found some ladies of his quality acquaintance\ninfected with the desire of making an experiment upon the skill of this\nnew conjurer, who pretended to be just arrived from the Mogul's empire,\nwhere he had learned the art from a Brachman philosopher. Our young\ngentleman affected to talk of the pretensions of this sage with ridicule\nand contempt, and with seeming reluctance undertook to attend them to\nhis apartment, observing, that it would be a very easy matter to detect\nthe fellow's ignorance, and no more than common justice to chastise him\nfor his presumption. Though he could easily perceive a great fund of\ncredulity in the company, they affected to espouse his opinion, and,\nunder the notion of a frolic, agreed that one particular lady should\nendeavour to baffle his art, by appearing before him in the dress of\nher woman, who should at the same time personate her mistress, and be\ntreated as such by our adventurer, who promised to squire them to the\nplace. These measures being concerted, and the appointment fixed for\nthe next audience-day, Peregrine furnished his friend with the necessary\ninformation, and, when the hour of assignation arrived, conducted his\ncharge to this oraculous seer.\n\nThey were admitted by our hero's valet-de-chambre, whose visage, being\nnaturally meagre and swarthy, was adorned with artificial whiskers; so\nthat he became the Persian dress which he wore, and seemed a very proper\nmaster of the ceremonies to an Oriental necromancer. Having crossed his\narms upon his breasts, with an inclination of the head, he stalked in\nsolemn silence before them into the penetralia of the temple, where\nthey found the conjurer sitting at a table, provided with pen, ink, and\npaper, divers books, mathematical instruments, and a long white wand\nlying across the whole. He was habited in a black gown and fur cap. His\ncountenance, over and above a double proportion of philosophic gravity,\nwhich he had assumed for the occasion, was improved by a thick beard,\nwhite as snow, that reached to his middle, and upon each shoulder sat a\nprodigious large black cat which had been tutored for the purpose.\n\nSuch a figure, which would have startled Peregrine himself, had not he\nbeen concerned in the mystery, could not fail to make an impression upon\nthose whom he accompanied. The fictitious chambermaid, in spite of all\nher natural pertness and vivacity, changed colour when she entered\nthe room, while the pretended lady, whose intellects were not quite so\nenlightened, began to tremble in every joint, and ejaculate petitions\nto Heaven for her safety. Their conductor, advancing to the table,\npresented his offering, and, pointing to the maid, told him, that lady\ndesired to know what would be her destiny in point of marriage. The\nphilosopher, without lifting up his eyes to view the person in whose\nbehalf he was consulted, turned his ear to one of the sable familiars\nthat purred upon his shoulder, and, taking up the pen, wrote upon a\ndetached slip of paper these words, which Peregrine, at the desire\nof the ladies, repeated aloud: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHer destiny will, in a great measure,\ndepend upon what happened to her about nine o'clock in the morning on\nthe third day of last December.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis sentence was no sooner pronounced, than the counterfeit lady\nscreamed, and ran into the ante-chamber, exclaiming, \u00e2\u0080\u009cChrist have mercy\nupon us! Sure he is the devil incarnate!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her mistress, who followed her\nwith great consternation, insisted upon knowing the transaction to which\nthe response alluded; and Mrs. Abigail, after some recollection, gave\nher to understand that she had an admirer, who, on that very hour and\nday mentioned by the cunning man, had addressed himself to her in\na serious proposal of marriage. This explanation, however, was more\ningenious than candid, for the admirer was no other than the identical\nMr. Pickle himself, who was a mere dragon among the chambermaids, and,\nin his previous information communicated to his associate, had given\nan account of this assignation, with which he had been favoured by the\ndamsel in question.\n\nOur hero seeing his company very much affected with the circumstance\nof the wizard's art, which had almost frightened both mistress and\nmaid into hysteric fits, pretended to laugh them out of their fears, by\nobserving, that there was nothing extraordinary in this instance of\nhis knowledge, which might have been acquired by some of those secret\nemissaries whom such impostors are obliged to employ for intelligence,\nor imparted by the lover himself, who had, perhaps, come to consult\nhim about the success of his amour. Encouraged by this observation, or\nrather prompted by an insatiable curiosity, which was proof against all\nsorts of apprehension, the disguised lady returned to the magician's own\napartment, and, assuming the air of a pert chambermaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Conjurer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnow you have satisfied my mistress, will you be as good as\nto tell me if ever I shall be married?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The sage, without the least\nhesitation, favoured her with an answer, in the following words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\ncannot be married before you are a widow; and whether or not that will\never be the case, is a question which my art cannot resolve, because my\nforeknowledge exceeds not the term of thirty years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis reply, which at once cut her off from her pleasing prospect of\nseeing herself independent in the enjoyment of youth and fortune, in\na moment clouded her aspect; all her good-humour was overcast, and she\nwent away, without further inquiry, muttering in the rancour of her\nchagrin, that he was a silly impertinent fellow, and a mere quack in\nhis profession. Notwithstanding the prejudice of this resentment, her\nconviction soon recurred; and when the report of his answers was made\nto those confederates by whom she had been deputed to make trial of\nhis skill, they were universally persuaded that his art was altogether\nsupernatural, though each affected to treat it with contempt, resolving\nin her own breast to have recourse to him in private.\n\nIn the meantime, the maid, though laid under the most peremptory\ninjunctions of secrecy, was so full of the circumstance which related to\nher own conduct, that she extolled his prescience, in whispers, to all\nacquaintances, assuring them, that he had told her all the particulars\nof her life; so that his fame was almost instantaneously conveyed,\nthrough a thousand different channels, to all parts of the town; and,\nthe very next time he assumed the chair, his doors were besieged by\ncurious people of all sects and denominations.\n\nBeing an old practitioner in this art, Cadwallader knew it would be\nimpossible for him to support his reputation in the promiscuous exercise\nof fortune-telling, because every person that should come to consult him\nwould expect a sample of his skill relating to things past; and it could\nnot be supposed that he was acquainted with the private concerns of\nevery individual who might apply to him for that purpose. He, therefore,\nordered his minister, whom he distinguished by the name of Hadgi Rourk,\nto signify to all those who demanded entrance, that his price was half a\nguinea; and that all such as were not disposed to gratify him with that\nconsideration, would do well to leave the passage free for the rest.\n\nThis declaration succeeded to his wish; for this congregation consisted\nchiefly of footmen, chambermaids, prentices, and the lower class of\ntradesmen, who could not afford to purchase prescience at such a price;\nso that, after fruitless offers of shillings and half-crowns, they\ndropped off one by one, and left the field open for customers of a\nhigher rank.\n\nThe first person of this species who appeared was dressed like the wife\nof a substantial tradesman; but this disguise could not screen her from\nthe penetration of the conjurer, who at first sight knew her to be one\nof the ladies of whose coming he had been apprised by Peregrine, on the\nsupposition that their curiosity was rather inflamed than allayed by\nthe intelligence they had received from his first client. This lady\napproached the philosopher with that intrepidity of countenance so\nconspicuous in matrons of her dignified sphere, and, in a soft voice,\nasked with a simper, of what complexion her next child would be? The\nnecromancer, who was perfectly well acquainted with her private history,\nforthwith delivered his response in the following question, written in\nthe usual form: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow long has Pompey the black been dismissed from your\nladyship's service?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEndued as she was with a great share of that fortitude which is\ndistinguished by the appellation of effrontery, her face exhibited\nsome signs of shame and confusion at the receipt of this oracular\ninterrogation, by which she was convinced of his extraordinary\nintelligence; and, accosting him in a very serious tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nshe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI perceive you are a person of great abilities in the art you\nprofess; and therefore, without pretending to dissemble, I will own you\nhave touched the true string of my apprehensions. I am persuaded I need\nnot be more particular in my inquiries. Here is a purse of money; take\nit, and deliver me from a most alarming and uneasy suspense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying,\nshe deposited her offering upon the table, and waited for his answer,\nwith a face of fearful expectation, while he was employed in writing\nthis sentence for her perusal: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThough I see into the womb of time,\nthe prospect is not perfectly distinct: the seeds of future events lie\nmingled and confused. So that I am under the necessity of assisting my\ndivination in some cases, by analogy and human intelligence; and cannot\npossibly satisfy your present doubts, unless you will condescend to make\nme privy to all those occurrences which you think might have interfered\nwith the cause of your apprehension.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe lady having read the declaration, affected a small emotion of\nshyness and repugnance, and, seating herself upon a settee, after having\ncautiously informed herself of the privacy of the apartment, gave such a\ndetail of the succession of her lovers, as amazed, while it entertained,\nthe necromancer, as well as his friend Pickle, who, from a closet\nin which he had concealed himself, overheard every syllable of her\nconfession. Cadwallader listened to her story with a look of infinite\nimportance and sagacity, and, after a short pause, told her, that he\nwould not pretend to give a categorical answer, until he should have\ndeliberated maturely upon the various circumstances of the affair; but,\nif she would take the trouble of honouring him with another visit on\nhis next public day, he hoped he should be able to give her full\nsatisfaction. Conscious of the importance of her doubts, she could\nnot help commending his caution, and took her leave, with a promise of\nreturning at the appointed time. Then the conjurer being joined by his\nassociate, they gave a loose to their mirth, which having indulged, they\nbegan to concert measures for inflicting some disgraceful punishment on\nthe shameless and insatiate termagant who had so impudently avowed her\nown prostitution.\n\nThey were interrupted, however, in their conference, by the arrival of\na new guest, who being announced by Hadgi, our hero retreated to his\nlurking-place, and Cadwallader resumed his mysterious appearance. This\nnew client, though she hid her face in a mask, could not conceal herself\nfrom the knowledge of the conjurer, who, by her voice, recognised her\nto be an unmarried lady of his own acquaintance. She had, within a small\ncompass of time, made herself remarkable for two adventures, which had\nnot at all succeeded to her expectation. Being very much addicted to\nplay, she had, at a certain rout, indulged that passion to such\nexcess, as not only got the better of her justice, but also of her\ncircumspection, so that she was unfortunately detected in her endeavours\nto appropriate to herself what was not lawfully her due. This small slip\nwas attended with another indiscretion, which had likewise an unlucky\neffect upon her reputation. She had been favoured with the addresses of\none of those hopeful heirs who swarm and swagger about town, under the\ndenomination of bucks; and, in the confidence of his honour, consented\nto be one of a party that made an excursion as far as Windsor, thinking\nherself secured from scandal by the company of another young lady,\nwho had also condescended to trust her person to the protection of her\nadmirer. The two gallants, in the course of this expedition, were said\nto use the most perfidious means to intoxicate the passions of their\nmistresses by mixing drugs with their wine, which inflamed their\nconstitutions to such a degree, that they fell an easy sacrifice to the\nappetites of their conductors, who, upon their return to town, were so\nbase and inhuman as to boast among their companions of the exploit they\nhad achieved. Thus the story was circulated, with a thousand additional\ncircumstances to the prejudice of the sufferers, one of whom had thought\nproper to withdraw into the country, until the scandal raised at her\nexpense should subside; while the other, who was not so easily put\nout of countenance, resolved to outface the report, as a treacherous\naspersion, invented by her lover as an excuse for his own inconstancy;\nand actually appeared in public, as usual, till she found herself\nneglected by the greatest part of her acquaintance.\n\nIn consequence of this disgrace, which she knew not whether to impute to\nthe card affair, or to the last faux pas she had committed, she now came\nto consult the conjurer, and signified her errand, by asking whether\nthe cause of her present disquiet was of the town or the country.\nCadwallader at once perceiving her allusion, answered her question\nin these terms: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis honest world will forgive a young gamester for\nindiscretion at play, but a favour granted to a babbling coxcomb is\nan unpardonable offence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This response she received with equal\nastonishment and chagrin; and, fully convinced of the necromancer's\nomniscience, implored his advice, touching the retrieval of her\nreputation: upon which he counselled her to wed with the first\nopportunity. She seemed so well pleased with his admonition, that she\ngratified him with a double fee, and, dropping a low curtsey, retired.\n\nOur undertakers now thought it high time to silence the oracle for the\nday, and Hadgi was accordingly ordered to exclude all comers, while\nPeregrine and his friend renewed the deliberations which had been\ninterrupted, and settled a plan of operations for the next occasion.\nMeanwhile it was resolved that Hadgi should not only exercise his\nown talents, but also employ inferior agents, in procuring general\nintelligence for the support of their scheme; that the expense of this\nministry should be defrayed from the profits of their professions; and\nthe remainder be distributed to poor families in distress.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXIII.\n\n\n\nPeregrine and his friend Cadwallader proceed in the Exercise of the\nMystery of Fortune-telling, in the course of which they achieve various\nAdventures.\n\n\nThese preliminaries being adjusted, our hero forthwith repaired to a\ncard assembly, which was frequented by some of the most notable gossips\nin town, and, having artfully turned the conversation upon the subject\nof the fortune-teller, whose talents he pretended to ridicule, incensed\ntheir itch of knowing secrets to such a degree of impatience, that their\ncuriosity became flagrant, and he took it for granted, that all or some\nof them would visit Albumazar on his very first visiting-day. While\nPeregrine was thus engaged, his associate made his appearance in another\nconvocation of fashionable people, where he soon had the pleasure of\nhearing the conjurer brought upon the carpet by an elderly gentlewoman,\nremarkable for her inquisitive disposition, who, addressing herself\nto Cadwallader, asked, by the help of the finger-alphabet, if he knew\nanything of the magician that made such a noise in town. The misanthrope\nanswered, as usual, in a surly tone: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy your question you must either\ntake me for a pimp or an idiot. What, in the name of nonsense, should\nI know of such a rascal, unless I were to court his acquaintance with a\nview to feast my own spleen, in seeing him fool the whole nation out\nof their money? Though, I suppose, his chief profits arise from his\npractice, in quality of pander. All fortune-tellers are bawds, and, for\nthat reason, are so much followed by people of fashion. This fellow,\nI warrant, has got sundry convenient apartments for the benefit of\nprocreation; for it is not to be supposed that those who visit him on\nthe pretence of consulting his supernatural art, can be such fools,\nsuch drivellers, as to believe that he can actually prognosticate future\nevents.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe company, according to his expectation, imputed his remarks to the\nrancour of his disposition, which could not bear to think that any\nperson upon earth was wiser than himself; and his ears were regaled with\na thousand instances of the conjurer's wonderful prescience, for which\nhe was altogether indebted to fiction. Some of these specimens being\ncommunicated to him by way of appeal to his opinion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmere phantoms of ignorance and credulity, swelled up in the\nrepetition, like those unsubstantial bubbles which the boys blow up in\nsoap-suds with a tobacco-pipe. And this will ever be the case in the\npropagation of all extraordinary intelligence. The imagination naturally\nmagnifies every object that falls under its cognizance, especially\nthose that concern the passions of fear and admiration; and when the\noccurrence comes to be rehearsed, the vanity of the relater exaggerates\nevery circumstance in order to enhance the importance of the\ncommunication. Thus an incident, which is but barely uncommon, often\ngains such accession in its progress through the fancies and mouths\nof those who represent it, that the original fact cannot possibly be\ndistinguished. This observation might be proved and illustrated by\na thousand undeniable examples, out of which I shall only select one\ninstance, for the entertainment and edification of the company.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A very\nhonest gentleman, remarkable for the gravity of his deportment, was one\nday in a certain coffee-house accosted by one of his particular friends,\nwho, taking him by the hand, expressed uncommon satisfaction in seeing\nhim abroad, and in good health, after the dangerous and portentous\nmalady he had undergone. Surprised at this salutation, the gentleman\nreplied, it was true he had been a little out of order overnight, but\nthere was nothing at all extraordinary in his indisposition. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJesu! not\nextraordinary!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the other, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen you vomited three black crows.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n This strange exclamation the grave gentleman at first mistook for\nraillery, though his friend was no joker; but, perceiving in him all the\nmarks of sincerity and astonishment, he suddenly changed his opinion,\nand, after a short reverie, taking him aside, expressed himself in these\nwords: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir, it is not unknown to you that I am at present engaged in a\ntreaty of marriage, which would have been settled long ago, had it\nnot been retarded by the repeated machinations of a certain person who\nprofessed himself my rival. Now I am fully persuaded that this affair of\nthe three crows is a story of his invention, calculated to prejudice me\nin the opinion of the lady, who, to be sure, would not choose to marry a\nman who has a rookery in his bowels; and, therefore, I must insist upon\nknowing the author of this scandalous report, that I may be able to\nvindicate my character from the malicious aspersion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His friend, who\nthought the demand was very reasonable, told him, without hesitation,\nthat he was made acquainted with the circumstances of his distemper by\nMr. Such-a-one, their common acquaintance: upon which the person who\nconceived himself injured went immediately in quest of his supposed\ndefamer, and having found him: \u00e2\u0080\u009cPray, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, with a peremptory\ntone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho told you that I vomited three black crows?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThree?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered the gentleman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mentioned two only.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cZounds! Sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried\nthe other, incensed at his indifference, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou will find the two too\nmany, if you refuse to discover the villainous source of such calumny.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n The gentleman, surprised at his heat, said he was sorry to find he had\nbeen the accidental instrument of giving him offence, but translated\nthe blame, if any there was, from himself to a third person, to\nwhose information he owed his knowledge of the report. The plaintiff,\naccording to the direction he received, repaired to the house of the\naccused; and his indignation being inflamed at finding the story had\nalready circulated among his acquaintance, he told him, with evident\nmarks of displeasure, that he was come to pluck the same brace of crows\nwhich he said he had disgorged. The defendant, seeing him very much\nirritated, positively denied that he had mentioned a brace: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne\nindeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI own I took notice of, upon the authority of your\nown physician, who gave me an account of it this morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the\nLord!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the sufferer, in a rage, which he could no longer contain,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat rascal has been suborned by my rival to slander my character in\nthis manner: but I'll be revenged, if there be either law or equity in\nEngland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He had scarce pronounced these words, when the doctor happened\nto enter the room: when his exasperated patient lifting up his cane,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSirrah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I live, I'll make that black crow the blackest\ncircumstance of thy whole life and conversation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The physician,\nconfounded at this address, assured him that he was utterly ignorant\nof his meaning, and, when the other gentleman explained it, absolutely\ndenied the charge, affirming he had said no more than that he had\nvomited a quantity of something as black as a crow. The landlord of the\nhouse acknowledged that he might have been mistaken; and thus the whole\nmystery was explained.\n\nThe company seeming to relish the story of the three black crows, which\nthey considered as an impromptu of Cadwallader's own invention; but,\ngranting it to be true, they unanimously declared that it could have no\nweight in invalidating the testimony of divers persons of honour, who\nhad been witnesses of the magician's supernatural skill. On the next\nday of consultation, the necromancer being in the chair, and his friend\nbehind the curtain, the outward door was scarce opened, when a female\nvisitant flounced in, and discovered to the magician the features of one\nof those inquisitive ladies, whose curiosity, he knew, his confederate\nhad aroused in the matter above described. She addressed herself to him\nwith a familiar air, observing, that she had heard much of his great\nknowledge, and was come to be a witness of his art, which she desired\nhim to display, in declaring what he knew to be her ruling passion.\n\nCadwallader, who was no stranger to her disposition, assumed the pen\nwithout hesitation, and furnished her with an answer, importing, that\nthe love of money predominated, and scandal possessed the next place\nin her heart. Far from being offended at his freedom, she commended\nhis frankness with a smile; and, satisfied of his uncommon talents,\nexpressed a desire of being better acquainted with his person; nay,\nshe began to catechise him upon the private history of divers great\nfamilies, in which he happened to be well versed: and he, in a\nmysterious manner, dropped such artful hints of his knowledge, that\nshe was amazed at his capacity, and actually asked if his art was\ncommunicable. The conjurer replied in the affirmative; but, at the same\ntime, gave her to understand, that it was attainable by those only who\nwere pure and undefiled in point of chastity and honour, or such as, by\na long course of penitence, had weaned themselves from all attachments\nto the flesh. She not only disapproved, but seemed to doubt the truth\nof this assertion; telling him, with a look of disdain, that his art\nwas not worth having, if one could not use it for the benefit of\none's pleasure; she had even penetration enough to take notice of\nan inconsistency in what he had advanced; and asked, why he himself\nexercised his knowledge for hire, if he was so much detached from all\nworldly concerns. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come, doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are in the right\nto be cautious against impertinent curiosity, but, perhaps, I may make\nit worth your while to be communicative.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese overtures were interrupted by a rap at the door, signifying the\napproach of another client; upon which the lady inquired for his private\npassage, through which she might retire, without the risk of being seen.\nWhen she understood he was deficient in that convenience, she withdrew\ninto an empty room adjoining to the audience-chamber, in order to\nconceal herself from the observation of the new-comer. This was no other\nthan the inamorata, who came, by appointment, to receive the solution of\nher doubts; and the misanthrope, glad of an opportunity to expose her to\nthe censure of such an indefatigable minister of fame as the person\nwho he knew would listen from the next apartment, laid her under the\nnecessity of refreshing his remembrance with a recapitulation of her\nformer confession, which was almost finished, when she was alarmed by a\nnoise at the door, occasioned by two gentlemen, who attempted to enter\nby force.\n\nTerrified at this uproar, which disconcerted the magician himself, she\nran for shelter into the place which was preoccupied by the other lady,\nwho, hearing this disturbance, had closed the window-shutters, that she\nmight have the better chance of remaining unknown. Here they ensconced\nthemselves in the utmost consternation, while the necromancer, after\nsome recollection, ordered Hadgi to open the door, and admit the\nrioters, who, he hoped, would be over-awed by the authority of his\nappearance. The janitor had no sooner obeyed his instructions, than\nin rushed a young libertine, who had been for some time upon the town,\ntogether with his tutor, who was a worn-out debauchee, well known to\nthe magician. They were both in that degree of intoxication necessary to\nprepare such dispositions for what they commonly call frolics, and the\nsober part of mankind feel to be extravagant outrages against the\nlaws of their country, and the peace of their fellow-subjects. Having\nstaggered up to the table, the senior, who undertook to be spokesman,\nsaluted Cadwallader with, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow dost do, old Capricorn? Thou seem'st\nto be a most venerable pimp, and, I doubt not, hast abundance of\ndiscretion. Here is this young whoremaster, a true chip of the old\nvenereal block his father, and myself, come for a comfortable cast\nof thy function. I don't mean that stale pretence of conjuring--d--\nfuturity; let us live for the present, old Haly. Conjure me up a couple\nof hale wenches, and I warrant we shall get into the magic circle in a\ntwinkling. What says Galileo? What says the Reverend Brahe? Here is a\npurse, you pimp. Hark, how it chinks! This is sweeter than the music of\nspheres.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOur necromancer, perplexed at this rencontre, made no reply; but, taking\nup his wand, waved it around his head in a very mysterious motion, with\na view of intimidating these forward visitants, who, far from being awed\nby this sort of evolution, became more and more obstreperous, and even\nthreatened to pull him by the beard, if he would not immediately comply\nwith their desire. Had he called his associate, or even Hadgi, to his\naid, he knew he could have soon calmed their turbulence; but, being\nunwilling to run the risk of a discovery, or even of a riot, he\nbethought himself of chastising their insolence in another manner, that\nwould be less hazardous, and rather more effectual. In consequence of\nthis suggestion, he pointed his wand towards the door of the\napartment in which the ladies had taken sanctuary; and the two rakes,\nunderstanding the hint, rushed in without hesitation.\n\nThe females, finding their place of retreat taken by assault, ran about\nthe room in great consternation, and were immediately taken prisoners\nby the assailants, who, pulling them towards the windows, opened the\nshutters at the same instant of time, when, strange to tell! one of the\nheroes discovered in the prize he had made, the very wife of his bosom;\nand his companion perceived that he had stumbled in the dark upon\nhis own mother. Their mutual astonishment was unspeakable at this\neclaircissement, which produced a universal silence for the space\nof several minutes. During this pause, the ladies having recollected\nthemselves, an expostulation was begun by the elder of the two, who\nroundly took her son to task for his disorderly life, which laid her\nunder the disagreeable necessity of watching his motions, and detecting\nhim in such an infamous place.\n\nWhile the careful mother thus exercised her talent for reprehension,\nthe hopeful young gentleman, with a hand in each fob, stood whistling\nan opera tune, without seeming to pay the most profound regard to his\nparent's reproof; and the other lady, in imitation of such a consummate\npattern, began to open upon her husband, whom she bitterly reproached\nwith his looseness and intemperance, demanding to know what he had to\nallege in alleviation of his present misconduct. The surprise occasioned\nby such an unexpected meeting, had already, in a great measure,\ndestroyed the effects of the wine he had so plentifully drunk, and\nthe first use he made of his recovered sobriety, was to revolve within\nhimself the motives that could possibly induce his wife to give him\nthe rendezvous in this manner. As he had good reason to believe she\nwas utterly void of jealousy, he naturally placed this rencontre to the\naccount of another passion; and his chagrin was not at all impaired by\nthe effrontery with which she now presumed to reprimand him. He listened\nto her, therefore, with a grave, or rather grim, aspect; and to the\nquestion with which she concluded her rebuke, answered, with great\ncomposure, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll that I have to allege, madam, is, that the bawd has\ncommitted a mistake, in consequence of which we are both disappointed;\nand so, ladies, your humble servant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he retired, with\nmanifest confusion in his looks; and, as he passed through the\naudience-chamber, eyeing the conjurer askance, pronounced the epithet\nof precious rascal, with great emphasis. Meanwhile, the junior, like\na dutiful child, handed his mamma to her chair; and the other client,\nafter having reviled the necromancer, because he could not foresee this\nevent, went away in a state of mortification.\n\nThe coast being clear, Peregrine came forth from his den, and\ncongratulated his friend upon the peaceable issue of the adventure,\nwhich he had overheard; but, that he might not be exposed to such\ninconvenience for the future, they resolved, that a grate should be\nfixed in the middle of the outward door, through which the conjurer\nhimself might reconnoitre all the visitants, before their admission; so\nthat, to those whose appearance he might not like, Hadgi should, without\nopening, give notice, that his master was engaged. By this expedient\ntoo, they provided against those difficulties which Cadwallader must\nhave encountered, in giving satisfaction to strangers, whom he did not\nknow: for the original intention of the founders was to confine the\npractice of their art to people of fashion only, most of whom were\npersonally known to the counterfeit magician and his coadjutors.\n\nIndeed these associates, Cadwallader in particular, notwithstanding his\nboasted insight into the characters of life, never imagined that his\npretended skill would be consulted by any but the weaker-minded of\nthe female sex, incited by that spirit of curiosity which he knew was\nimplanted in their nature; but, in the course of his practice, he found\nhimself cultivated in his preternatural capacity by people of all sexes,\ncomplexions, and degrees of reputation, and had occasion to observe,\nthat, when the passions are concerned, howsoever cool, cautious, and\ndeliberate the disposition may otherwise be, there is nothing so idle,\nfrivolous, or absurd, to which they will not apply for encouragement\nand gratification. The last occurrence, according to the hopes and\nexpectation of the confederates, was whispered about by the ladies\nconcerned, in such a manner, that the whole affair was in a few days the\nuniversal topic of discourse, in which it was retailed with numberless\nembellishments, invented by the parties themselves, who had long\nindulged a pique at each other, and took this opportunity of enjoying\ntheir revenge.\n\nThese incidents, while they regaled the spleen, at the same time\naugmented the renown of the conjurer, who was described on both sides as\na very extraordinary person in his way; and the alteration in his door\nwas no sooner performed, than he had occasion to avail himself of it,\nagainst the intrusion of a great many, with whom he would have found it\nvery difficult to support the fame he had acquired.\n\nAmong those who appeared at his grate, he perceived a certain clergyman,\nwhom he had long known a humble attendant on the great, and with some\nthe reputed minister of their pleasures. This Levite had disguised\nhimself in a greatcoat, boots, and dress quite foreign to the habit\nworn by those of his function; and, being admitted, attempted to impose\nhimself as a country squire upon the conjurer, who, calling him by his\nname, desired him to sit down. This reception corresponding with the\nreport he had heard, touching our magician's art, the doctor said he\nwould lay aside all dissimulation. After having professed an implicit\nbelief, that his supernatural knowledge did not proceed from any\ncommunication with evil spirits, but was the immediate gift of Heaven,\nhe declared the intention of his coming, was to inquire into the health\nof a good friend and brother of his, who possessed a certain living in\nthe country, which he named; and, as he was old and infirm, to know what\nspace of time was allotted to him in this frail state of mortality, that\nhe might have the melancholy satisfaction of attending him in his last\nmoments, and assisting him in his preparations for eternity.\n\nThe conjurer, who at once perceived the purport of this question,\nafter a solemn pause, during which he seemed absorbed in contemplation,\ndelivered this response to his consulter: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThough I foresee some\noccurrences, I do not pretend to be omniscient. I know not to what age\nthat clergyman's life will extend; but so far I can penetrate into\nthe womb of time, as to discern, that the incumbent will survive his\nintended successor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This dreadful sentence in a moment banished the\nblood from the face of the appalled consulter, who, hearing his own doom\npronounced, began to tremble in every joint; he lifted up his eyes in\nthe agony of fear, and saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe will of God be done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d withdrew in\nsilent despondence, his teeth chattering with terror and dismay.\n\nThis client was succeeded by an old man about the age of seventy-five,\nwho, being resolved to purchase a lease, desired to be determined in the\nterm of years by the necromancer's advice, observing, that, as he had\nno children of his own body, and had no regard for his heirs-at-law,\nthe purchase would be made with a view to his own convenience only; and\ntherefore, considering his age, he himself hesitated in the period of\nthe lease, between thirty and three-score years.\n\nThe conjurer, upon due deliberation, advised him to double the last\nspecified term, because he distinguished in his features something\nportending extreme old age and second childhood, and he ought to provide\nfor that state of incapacity, which other-wise would be attended with\ninfinite misery and affliction. The superannuated wretch, thunderstruck\nwith this prediction, held up his hands, and in the first transports\nof his apprehension, exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLord have mercy upon me! I have not\nwherewithal to purchase such a long lease, and I have long outlived all\nmy friends; what then must become of me, sinner that I am, one hundred\nand twenty years hence!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cadwallader, who enjoyed his terror,\nunder pretence of alleviating his concern, told him that what he had\nprognosticated did not deprive him of the means which he and every\nperson had in their power, to curtail a life of misfortune; and the old\ngentleman went away, seemingly comforted with the assurance, that\nit would always be in his power to employ a halter for his own\ndeliverance.\n\nSoon after the retreat of this elder, the magician was visited by one\nof those worthies known among the Romans by the appellation of\nhaeredipetae, who had amassed a large fortune by a close attention\nto the immediate wants and weakness of raw, inexperienced heirs.\nThis honourable usurer had sold an annuity upon the life of a young\nspendthrift, being thereto induced by the affirmation of his physician,\nwho had assured him his patient's constitution was so rotten, that he\ncould not live one year to an end. He had, nevertheless, made shift to\nweather eighteen months, and now seemed more vigorous and healthy\nthan he had ever been known: for he was supposed to have nourished an\nhereditary pox from his cradle. Alarmed at this alteration, the seller\ncame to consult Cadwallader, not only about the life of the annuitant,\nbut also concerning the state of his health at the time of his\npurchasing the annuity, purposing to sue the physician for false\nintelligence, should the conjurer declare that the young man was\nsound when the doctor pronounced him diseased. But this was a piece of\nsatisfaction he did not obtain from the misanthrope, who, in order\nto punish his sordid disposition, gave him to understand, that the\nphysician had told him the truth, and nothing but the truth; and that\nthe young gentleman was in a fair way of attaining a comfortable old\nage. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is to say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the client, in the impatience of his\nmortification at this answer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbating accidents; for, thank God, the\nannuitant does not lead the most regular life. Besides, I am credibly\ninformed he is choleric and rash, so that he may be concerned in a duel.\nThen there are such things as riots in the street, in which a rake's\nskull may be casually cracked; he may be overturned in a coach, overset\nin the river, thrown from a vicious horse, overtaken with a cold,\nendangered by a surfeit; but what I place my chief confidence in, is a\nhearty pox, a distemper which hath been fatal to his whole family. Not\nbut that the issue of all these things is uncertain, and expedients\nmight be found which would more effectually answer the purpose. I know\nthey have arts in India, by which a man can secure his own interest, in\nthe salutation of a friendly shake by the hand; and I don't doubt that\nyou, who have lived in that country, are master of the secret. To be\nsure, if you were inclined to communicate such a nostrum, there are\nabundance of people who would purchase it at a very high price.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCadwallader understood this insinuation, and was tempted to amuse him\nin such a manner as would tend to his disgrace and confusion; but,\nconsidering that the case was of too criminal a nature to be tampered\nwith, he withstood his desire of punishing this rapacious cormorant any\nother way than by telling him he would not impart the secret for his\nwhole fortune ten times doubled; so that the usurer retired, very much\ndissatisfied with the issue of his consultation.\n\nThe next person who presented himself at this altar of intelligence,\nwas an author, who recommended himself to a gratis advice, by observing,\nthat a prophet and poet were known by the same appellation among the\nancients; and that, at this day, both the one and the other spoke by\ninspiration. The conjurer refused to own this affinity, which, he said,\nformerly subsisted, because both species of the vates were the children\nof fiction; but as he himself did not fall under that predicament, he\nbegged leave to disown all connection with the family of the poets; and\nthe poor author would have been dismissed without his errand, though he\noffered to leave an ode as security for the magician's fee, to be\npaid from the profits of his first third night, had not Cadwallader's\ncuriosity prompted him to know the subject of this gentleman's inquiry.\nHe therefore told him, that, in consideration of his genius, he would\nfor once satisfy him without a fee; and desired him to specify the\ndoubts in which he wished to be resolved.\n\nThe son of Parnassus, glad of this condescension, for which he thanked\nthe necromancer, gave him to understand, that he had some time before\npresented a play in manuscript to a certain great man, at the head of\ntaste, who had not only read and approved the performance, but also\nundertaken to introduce and support it on the stage; that he, the\nauthor, was assured by this patron, that the play was already, in\nconsequence of his recommendation, accepted by one of the managers, who\nhad faithfully promised to bring it to light; but that, when he waited\non this said manager, to know when he intended to put his production\nin rehearsal, the man declared he had never seen or heard of the piece.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Mr. Conjurer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to know whether or not my play has\nbeen presented, and if I have any sort of chance of seeing it acted this\nwinter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCadwallader, who had, in his younger days, sported among the theatrical\nmuses, began to lose his temper at this question, which recalled the\nremembrance of his own disappointments; and despatched the author\nwith an abrupt answer, importing that the affairs of the stage were\naltogether without the sphere of his divination, being entirely\nregulated by the daemons of dissimulation, ignorance, and caprice.\n\nIt would be an endless task to recount every individual response\nwhich our magician delivered in the course of his conjuration. He was\nconsulted in all cases of law, physic, and trade, over and above the\nordinary subjects of marriage and fornication; his advice and assistance\nwere solicited by sharpers, who desired to possess an infallible method\nof cheating unperceived; by fortune-hunters, who wanted to make prize of\nwidows and heiresses; by debauchees, who were disposed to be with other\nmen's wives; by coxcombs, who longed for the death of their fathers;\nby wenches with child, who wished themselves rid of their burdens; by\nmerchants, who had insured above value, and thirsted after the news of a\nwreck; by underwriters, who prayed for the gift of prescience, that they\nmight venture money upon such ships only as should perform the voyage\nin safety; by Jews, who wanted to foresee the fluctuations of stock; by\nusurers, who advance money upon undecided causes; by clients, who\nwere dubious of the honesty of their counsel. In short, all matters\nof uncertain issue were appealed to this tribunal; and, in point of\ncalculation, De Moivre was utterly neglected.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXIV.\n\n\n\nThe Conjurer and his Associate execute a Plan of Vengeance against\ncertain Infidels who pretend to despise their Art; and Peregrine\nachieves an Adventure with a young Nobleman.\n\n\nBy these means, the whole variety of characters undisguised passed, as\nit were, in review before the confederates, who, by divers ingenious\ncontrivances, punished the most flagrant offenders with as much severity\nas the nature of their plan would allow. At length they projected a\nscheme for chastising a number of their own acquaintance, who had all\nalong professed the utmost contempt for the talent of this conjurer,\nwhich they endeavoured to ridicule in all companies, where his\nsurprising art was the subject of discourse; not that they had sense\nand discernment enough to perceive the absurdity of his pretensions,\nbut affected a singularity of opinions, with a view of insulting the\ninferior understandings of those who were deceived by such an idle\nimpostor.\n\nPeregrine, indeed, for obvious reasons, had always espoused their\njudgment in this case, and joined them in reviling the public character\nof his friend. But he knew how far the capacities of those virtuosi\nextended, and had frequently caught them in the fact of recounting their\nexploits against the conjurer, which were the productions of their own\ninvention only. On these considerations, his wrath was kindled against\nthem, and he accordingly concerted measures with his coadjutor, for\noverwhelming them with confusion and dismay.\n\nIn the first place, a report was spread by his emissaries, that the\nmagician had undertaken to entertain their view with the appearance of\nany person whom his customers should desire to see, whether dead, or at\nthe distance of a thousand leagues. This extraordinary proposal chancing\nto be the subject of conversation in a place where most of those\ninfidels were assembled, they talked of it in the usual style, and some\nof them swore the fellow ought to be pilloried for his presumption.\n\nOur hero, seizing this favourable opportunity, acquiesced in their\nremarks, and observed, with great vehemence, that it would be a\nmeritorious action to put the rascal to the proof, and then toss him in\na blanket for non-performance. They were wonderfully pleased with this\nsuggestion, and forthwith determined to try the experiment; though, as\nthey understood the apparition would be produced to one only at a time,\nthey could not immediately agree in the choice of the person who should\nstand the first brunt of the magician's skill. While each of them\nseverally excused himself from this preference on various pretences,\nPeregrine readily undertook the post, expressing great confidence of the\nconjurer's incapacity to give him the least cause of apprehension.\n\nThis point being settled, they detached one of their number to Crabtree,\nin order to bespeak and adjust the hour and terms of the operation,\nwhich he insisted upon performing at his own apartment, where everything\nwas prepared for the occasion. At the appointed time, they went thither\nin a body, to the number of seven, in full expectation of detecting the\nimpostor; and were received with such gloomy formality, as seemed to\nhave an effect upon the countenances of some among them; though they\nwere encouraged by the vivacity of Pickle, who affected a double share\nof petulance, for the more effectual accomplishment of his purpose.\n\nCadwallader made no reply to the interrogations they uttered, in the\nlevity of their insolence, at the first entrance, but ordered Hadgi to\nconduct them through the next room, that they might see there was no\nprevious apparatus to affright their deputy with objects foreign to his\nundertaking. They found nothing but a couple of wax tapers burning on a\ntable that stood with a chair by it in the middle of the apartment,\nand returned to the audience-chamber, leaving Peregrine by himself,\nto encounter the phantom of that person whom they should, without his\nknowledge, desire the magician to conjure up to his view.\n\nAll the doors being shut and the company seated, a profound silence\nensued, together with a face of dreadful expectation, encouraged by\nthe blue flame of the candles, which were tipped with sulphur for that\npurpose, and heightened by the dismal sound of a large bell, which Hadgi\ntolled in the ante-chamber. Cadwallader having thus practised upon their\nignorance and fear, desired them to name the person to be produced.\nAfter some whispers among themselves, one of them took the pen, and,\nwriting the name of Commodore Trunnion upon a slip of paper, put it into\nthe hands of the magician, who rose from his seat, and, opening the\ndoor of his closet, displayed to their view a skull, with thigh bones\ncrossed, upon a table covered with black cloth.\n\nThis melancholy spectacle made a remarkable impression upon the\nimaginations of the company, already prepossessed by the previous\nceremony; and they began to survey one another with looks of\nconsternation, while Cadwallader, shutting himself in the closet,\nthat was contiguous to the chamber in which his friend Peregrine was\nstationed, thrust the label with his uncle's name through a small chink\nin the partition according to agreement, muttering at the time a sort\nof gibberish, that increased the panic of his audience; then returning\nto his chair, the knell was tolled again, and Pickle called aloud, \u00e2\u0080\u009cD--n\nyour mummery: why don't you despatch?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was a signal to Crabtree, who thus certified of his having received\nthe paper, stood up and waved his wand in the figure of an S. The motion\nbeing thrice performed, their ears were all of a sudden invaded by\na terrible noise in the next room, accompanied with the voice of\nPeregrine, who exclaimed, in a tone of horror and amazement, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGuard me,\nHeaven! my Uncle Trunnion!\u00e2\u0080\u009d This ejaculation had such an effect upon the\nhearers, that two of them swooned with fear, a third fell upon his knees\nand prayed aloud, while the other three, in a transport of dismay and\ndistraction, burst open the door, and rushed into the haunted chamber,\nwhere they found the table and chair overturned, and Peregrine extended,\nin all appearance without sense or motion, upon the floor.\n\nThey immediately began to chafe his temples, and the first symptom of\nhis recovery which they perceived was a hollow groan; after which he\npronounced these words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMerciful powers! if I live I saw the commodore\nwith his black patch, in the very clothes he wore at my sister's\nwedding.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This declaration completed their astonishment and terror; they\nobserved a wildness in his looks, which he seemed to bend on something\nconcealed from their view; and were infected by his appearance to such\na pitch of superstition, that it would have been an easy matter to\npersuade them that the chair and table were apparitions of their\nforefathers. However, they conducted Peregrine into the council chamber,\nwhere the conjurer and Hadgi were employed in ministering to those who\nhad fainted.\n\nThe patients having retrieved the use of their faculties, Cadwallader,\nassuming a double portion of severity in his aspect, asked if they were\nnot ashamed of their former incredulity; declaring, that he was ready\nto give them more convincing proofs of his art upon the spot, and would\nimmediately recall three generations of their progenitors from the dead,\nif they were disposed to relish such company. Then turning to one of\nthem, whose grandfather had been hanged, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cambitious\nof seeing the first remarkable personage of your family? Say the word\nand he shall appear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis youth, who had been the most insolent and obstreperous in the whole\nsociety, and was now depressed with the same proportion of fear, alarmed\nat the proposal, assured the magician he had no curiosity of that sort\nremaining; and that what he had already seen would, he hoped, have a\ngood effect upon his future life and conversation. Every one of these\nheroes made an acknowledgment and profession of the same kind, some of\nwhich were attended with tears; and Hadgi having provided chairs for the\nwhole company, they departed exceedingly crest-fallen. Two of the number\nactually sickened with the agitation they had undergone, while our\nhero and his associate made themselves merry with the success of their\nenterprise.\n\nBut this scheme of fortune-telling did not engross his whole attention;\nhe still continued to maintain his appearance in the beau monde; and, as\nhis expense far exceeded his income, strove to contract intimacies with\npeople of interest and power; he showed himself regularly at court, paid\nhis respects to them in all places of public diversion, and frequently\nentered into their parties, either of pleasure or cards. In the\ncourse of this cultivation, he happened one evening, at a certain\nchocolate-house, to overlook a match of piquet, in which he perceived\na couple of sharpers making a prey of a young nobleman, who had neither\ntemper nor skill sufficient to cope with such antagonists.\n\nOur hero, being a professed enemy to all knights of industry, could\nnot bear to see them cheat in public with such insolent audacity. Under\npretence of communicating some business of importance, he begged the\nfavour of speaking to the young gentleman in another corner of the\nroom, and in a friendly manner cautioned him against his opponents. This\nhot-headed representative, far from thinking or owning himself obliged\nto Pickle for his good counsel, looked upon his advice as an insult upon\nhis understanding; and replied, with an air of ferocious displeasure,\nthat he knew how to take care of his own concerns, and would not suffer\neither him or them to bubble him out of a shilling.\n\nPeregrine, offended at the association, as well as at the ingratitude\nand folly of this conceited coxcomb, expressed his resentment, by\ntelling him, that he expected at least an acknowledgment for his candid\nintention; but he found his intellects too much warped by his vanity\nto perceive his own want of capacity and experience. Inflamed by this\nreproof, the young nobleman challenged him to play for five hundred\npounds, with many opprobrious, or at least contemptuous terms of\ndefiance, which provoked our hero to accept the proposal. After the\nother had disengaged himself from the old rooks, who were extremely\nmortified at the interruption, the two young champions sat down, and\nfortune acting with uncommon impartiality, Pickle, by the superiority of\nhis talents, in two hours won to the amount of as many thousand pounds,\nfor which he was obliged to take his antagonist's note, the sharpers\nhaving previously secured his ready money.\n\nFrantic with his loss, the rash young man would have continued the game,\nand doubled stakes every time; so that Peregrine might have increased\nhis acquisition to ten times the sum he had gained; but he thought he\nhad already sufficiently chastised the presumption of the challenger,\nand was unwilling to empower fortune to ravish from him the fruits of\nhis success; he therefore declined my lord's proposal, unless he would\nplay for ready money; and his lordship having in vain tried his credit\namong the company, our adventurer withdrew, leaving him in an ecstasy of\nrage and disappointment.\n\nAs the insolence of his behaviour had increased with his ill-luck, and\nhe had given vent to divers expressions which Peregrine took amiss, our\nyoung gentleman resolved to augment his punishment, by teasing him with\ndemands which could not, he knew, be immediately satisfied; and next day\nsent Pipes to his father's house with the note, which was drawn payable\nupon demand. The debtor, who had gone to bed half-distracted with his\nmisfortune, finding himself waked with such a disagreeable dun, lost\nall patience, cursed Pickle, threatened his messenger, blasphemed with\nhorrible execrations, and made such a noise as reached the ears of his\nfather, who, ordering his son to be called into his presence, examined\nhim about the cause of that uproar, which had disturbed the whole\nfamily. The young gentleman, after having essayed to amuse him with\nsundry equivocations, which served only to increase his suspicion and\ndesire of knowing the truth, acknowledged that he had lost some money\novernight at cards, to a gamester who had been so impertinent as to send\na message, demanding it that morning, though he had told the fellow that\nit would not suit him to pay him immediately. The father, who was a\nman of honour, reproached him with great severity for his profligate\nbehaviour in general, and this scandalous debt in particular, which he\nbelieved to be some trifle; then giving him a bank-note for five hundred\npounds, commanded him to go and discharge it without loss of time. This\nwell-principled heir took the money; but, instead of waiting upon\nhis creditor, he forthwith repaired to the gaming-house, in hopes of\nretrieving his loss; and, before he rose from the table, saw his note\nmortgaged for seven-eighths of its value.\n\nMeanwhile, Pickle, incensed at the treatment which his servant had\nreceived, and informed of his lordship's second loss, which aggravated\nhis resentment, determined to preserve no medium; and, taking out a\nwrit the same day, put it immediately in execution upon the body of\nhis debtor, just as he stepped into his chair at the door of White's\nchocolate-house. The prisoner, being naturally fierce and haughty,\nattempted to draw upon the bailiffs, who disarmed him in a twinkling;\nand this effort served only to heighten his disgrace; which was\nwitnessed by a thousand people, most of whom laughed very heartily at\nthe adventure of a lord's being arrested.\n\nSuch a public transaction could not long escape the knowledge of his\nfather, who that very day had the satisfaction to hear that his son was\nin a spunging-house. In consequence of this information, he sent\nhis steward to learn the particulars of the arrest, and was equally\noffended, surprised, and concerned, when he understood the nature of the\ndebt, which he imagined his son had already discharged. Unwilling to\npay such a considerable sum for a spendthrift, whom he had but too much\nindulged, and who in less than one week might involve himself in such\nanother difficulty, the old gentleman wrote a letter to Peregrine,\nrepresenting what a hardship it would be upon him to forfeit such sums\nby the indiscretion of a son, whose engagements he was not bound to\nfulfil, and desiring some mitigation in his demand, as it was not a debt\ncontracted for value received, but incurred without subjecting him to\nthe least damage or inconvenience.\n\nOur adventurer no sooner received this letter, than he went in person\nto wait upon the author, to whom he, in a candid manner, related the\nparticular circumstances of the match, together with the ingratitude and\naudacity of his son, which he owned had stimulated him to such measures\nas he otherwise would have scorned to take. The nobleman acknowledged\nthat the revenge was hardly adequate to the provocation, and condemned\nthe conduct of his son with such justice and integrity, as disarmed\nPeregrine of his resentment, and disposed him to give an undoubted\nproof of his own disinterestedness, which he immediately exhibited, by\nproducing the note, and tearing it to pieces, after having assured his\nlordship that the writ should be withdrawn, and the prisoner discharged\nbefore night.\n\nThe earl, who perfectly well understood the value of money, and was no\nstranger to the characters of mankind, stood amazed at the sacrifice,\nwhich Pickle protested was offered by his esteem for his lordship; and,\nafter having complimented him upon his generosity, in a very uncommon\nstrain of encomium, begged the favour of his acquaintance, and insisted\nupon his dining with him next day. The youth, proud of having met\nwith such an opportunity to distinguish himself, in less than an hour\nperformed every article of his promise; and in the morning was visited\nby the debtor, who came, by the express order of his father, to thank\nhim for the obligation under which he was laid, and to ask pardon for\nthe offence he had given.\n\nThis condescension was very glorious for our hero, who graciously\nreceived his submission, and accompanied him to dinner, where he was\ncaressed by the old earl with marks of particular affection and esteem.\nNor was his gratitude confined to exterior civility; he offered him the\nuse of his interest at court, which was very powerful, and repeated his\ndesire of serving him so pressingly, that Peregrine thought he could not\ndispense with the opportunity of assisting his absent friend Godfrey, in\nwhose behalf he begged the influence of his lordship.\n\nThe earl, pleased with this request, which was another proof of the\nyoung gentleman's benevolence, said, he would not fail to pay the utmost\nregard to his recommendation; and in six weeks a captain's commission\nwas actually signed for the brother of Emilia, who was very agreeably\nsurprised at the intimation he received from the War Office, though\nhe was utterly ignorant of the canal through which he obtained that\npromotion.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXV.\n\n\n\nPeregrine is celebrated as a Wit and Patron, and proceeds to entertain\nhimself at the Expense of whom it did concern.\n\n\nIn the meantime, Peregrine flourished in the gay scenes of life, and,\nas I have already observed, had divers opportunities of profiting in the\nway of marriage, had not his ambition been a little too inordinate, and\nhis heart still biased by a passion, which all the levity of youth could\nnot balance, nor all the pride of vanity overcome. Nor was our hero\nunmarked in the world of letters and taste; he had signalized himself in\nseveral poetical productions, by which he had acquired a good share of\nreputation: not that the pieces were such as ought to have done much\nhonour to his genius; but any tolerable performance from a person of his\nfigure and supposed fortune, will always be considered by the bulk of\nreaders as an instance of astonishing capacity; though the very same\nproduction, ushered into the world with the name of an author in less\naffluent circumstances would be justly disregarded and despised; so\nmuch is the opinion of most people influenced and overawed by ridiculous\nconsiderations.\n\nBe this as it will, our young gentleman was no sooner distinguished\nas an author, than he was marked out as a patron by all the starving\nretainers to poetry; he was solemnised in odes, celebrated in epigrams,\nand fed with the milk of soft dedication. His vanity even relished this\nincense; and, though his reason could not help despising those that\noffered it, not one of them was sent away unowned by his munificence.\nHe began to think himself, in good earnest, that superior genius which\ntheir flattery had described; he cultivated acquaintance with the wits\nof fashion, and even composed in secret a number of bon-mots, which\nhe uttered in company as the impromptus of his imagination. In this\npractice, indeed, he imitated some of the most renowned geniuses of the\nage, who, if the truth were known, have laboured in secret, with the\nsweat of their brows, for many a repartee which they have vended as the\nimmediate production of fancy and expression. He was so successful in\nthis exercise of his talents, that his fame actually came in competition\nwith that great man who had long sat at the helm of wit; and, in a\ndialogue that once happened between them, on the subject of a corkscrew,\nwherein the altercation was discharged, according to Bayes, slap for\nslap, dash for dash, our hero was judged to have the better of his\nlordship, by some of the minor satellites, that commonly surround and\nreflect the rays of such mighty luminaries.\n\nIn a word, he dipped himself so far in these literary amusements, that\nhe took the management of the pit into his direction, putting himself\nat the head of those critics who call themselves the town; and in that\ncapacity chastised several players, who had been rendered insolent\nand refractory by unmerited success. As for the new productions of the\nstage, though generally unspirited and insipid, they always enjoyed the\nbenefit of his influence and protection; because he never disliked the\nperformance so much as he sympathized with the poor author, who stood\nbehind the scenes in the most dreadful suspense, trembling, as it were,\non the very brink of damnation. Yet, though he extended his generosity\nand compassion to the humble and needy, he never let slip one\nopportunity of mortifying villainy and arrogance. Had the executive\npower of the legislature been vested in him, he would have doubtless\ndevised strange species of punishment for all offenders against humanity\nand decorum; but, restricted as he was, he employed his invention in\nsubjecting them to the ridicule and contempt of their fellow-subjects.\n\nIt was with this view he set on foot the scheme of conjuration, which\nwas still happily carried on, and made use of the intelligence of his\nfriend Cadwallader; though he sometimes converted this advantage to the\npurposes of gallantry, being, as the reader may have perceived, of a\nvery amorous complexion. He not only acted the reformer, or rather the\ncastigator, in the fashionable world, but also exercised his\ntalents among the inferior class of people, who chanced to incur his\ndispleasure. One mischievous plan that entered our hero's imagination\nwas suggested by two advertisements published in the same paper, by\npersons who wanted to borrow certain sums of money, for which they\npromised to give undeniable security. Peregrine, from the style and\nmanner of both, concluded they were written by attorneys, a species of\npeople for whom he entertained his uncle's aversion. In order to amuse\nhimself and some of his friends with their disappointment, he wrote\na letter signed A. B. to each advertiser, according to the address\nspecified in the newspaper, importing, that if he would come with his\nwritings to a certain coffee-house near the Temple, precisely at six in\nthe evening, he would find a person sitting in the right-hand box next\nto the window, who would be glad to treat with him about the subject of\nhis advertisement; and, should his security be liked, would accommodate\nhim with the sum which he wanted to raise. Before the hour of this\ndouble appointment, Pickle, with his friend Cadwallader, and a few more\ngentlemen, to whom he had thought proper to communicate the plan, went\nto the coffee-house, and seated themselves near the place that was\ndestined for their meeting.\n\nThe hope of getting money had such an evident effect upon their\npunctuality, that one of them arrived a considerable time before the\nhour; and having reconnoitred the room, took his station according to\nthe direction he had received, fixing his eye upon a dock that stood\nbefore him, and asking of the barkeeper, if it was not too slow. He,\nhad not remained in this posture many minutes, when he was joined by a\nstrange figure that waddled into the room, with a bundle of papers in\nhis bosom, and the sweat running over his nose. Seeing a man in the box\nto which he had been directed, he took it for granted that he was the\nlender; and as soon as he could recover his breath, which was almost\nexhausted by the despatch he had made, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI presume\nyou are the gentleman I was to meet about that loan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here he was\ninterrupted by the other, who eagerly replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA. B., sir, I suppose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe same,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the last-comer: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was afraid I should be too late;\nfor I was detained beyond my expectation by a nobleman at the other end\nof the town, that wants to mortgage a small trifle of his estate, about\na thousand a year; and my watch happens to be in the hands of the maker,\nhaving met with an accident a few nights ago, which set it asleep.\nBut, howsomever, there is no time lost, and I hope this affair will be\ntransacted to the satisfaction of us both. For my own part, I love to do\ngood offices myself, and therefore I expect nothing but what is fair and\nhonest of other people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis new friend was exceedingly comforted by this declaration, which he\nconsidered as a happy omen of his success; and the hope of fingering\nthe cash operated visibly in his countenance, while he expressed his\nsatisfaction at meeting with a person of such candour and humanity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\npleasure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cof dealing with an easy conscientious man is, in my\nopinion, superior to that of touching all the money upon earth; for what\njoy can be compared with what a generous mind feels in befriending its\nfellow-creatures? I was never so happy in my life, as at one time, in\nlending five hundred pounds to a worthy gentleman in distress, without\ninsisting upon rigid security. Sir, one may easily distinguish an\nupright man by his countenance: for example now, I think I could\ntake your word for ten thousand pounds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The other, with great joy,\nprotested, that he was right in his conjecture, and returned the\ncompliment a thousand-fold; by which means, the expectation of both was\nwound up to a very interesting pitch; and both, at the same instant,\nbegan to produce their papers, in the untying of which their hands shook\nwith transports of eagerness and impatience; while their eyes were so\nintent upon their work, that they did not perceive the occupation of\neach other.\n\nAt length, one of them, having got the start of the other, and unrolled\nseveral skins of musty parchment, directed his view to the employment of\nhis friend; and, seeing him fumbling at his bundle, asked if that was\na blank bond and conveyance which he had brought along with him. The\nother, without lifting up his eyes, or desisting from his endeavours to\nloose the knot, which by this time he had applied to his teeth, answered\nthis question in the negative, observing that the papers in his hand\nwere the security which he proposed to give for the money. This reply\nconverted the looks of the inquirer into a stare of infinite solidity,\naccompanied with the word Anan! which he pronounced in a tone of fear\nand astonishment. The other, alarmed at this note, cast his eyes towards\nthe supposed lender, and was in a moment infected by his aspect. All\nthe exultation of hope that sparkled in their eyes was now succeeded by\ndisappointment and dismay; and while they gazed ruefully at each other,\ntheir features were gradually elongated, like the transient curls of a\nMiddle-row periwig.\n\nThis emphatic silence was, however, broken by the last-comer, who, in\na faltering accent, desired the other to recollect the contents of his\nletter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf your letter!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the first, putting into his hand the\nadvertisement he had received from Pickle; which he had no sooner\nperused, than he produced his own for the satisfaction of the other\nparty. So that another gloomy pause ensued, at the end of which, each\nuttered a profound sigh, or rather groan, and, rising up, sneaked off\nwithout further communication, he who seemed to be the most afflicted of\nthe two, taking his departure, with an exclamation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cHumbugged, egad!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSuch were the amusements of our hero, though they did not engross his\nwhole time, some part of which was dedicated to nocturnal riots and\nrevels, among a set of young noblemen, who had denounced war against\ntemperance, economy, and common sense, and were indeed the devoted sons\nof tumult, waste, and prodigality. Not that Peregrine relished those\nscenes, which were a succession of absurd extravagance, devoid of all\ntrue spirit, taste, or enjoyment. But his vanity prompted him to mingle\nwith those who are entitled the choice spirits of the age; and his\ndisposition was so pliable, as to adapt itself easily to the measures of\nhis company, where he had not influence enough to act in the capacity\nof a director. Their rendezvous was a certain tavern, which might be\nproperly styled the temple of excess, where they left the choice of\ntheir fare to the discretion of the landlord, that they might save\nthemselves the pains of exercising their own reason; and, in order to\navoid the trouble of adjusting the bill, ordered the waiter to declare\nhow much every individual must pay, without specifying the articles of\nthe charge. This proportion generally amounted to two guineas per head\nfor each dinner and supper; and frequently exceeded that sum; of which\nthe landlord durst not abate, without running the risk of having his\nnose slit for his moderation.\n\nBut this was puny expense compared with that which they often incurred,\nby the damage done to the furniture and servants, in the madness of\ntheir intoxication, as well as the loss they sustained at hazard, an\namusement to which all of them had recourse in the progress of their\ndebauches. This elegant diversion was introduced, encouraged, and\npromoted by a crew of rapacious sharpers, who had made themselves\nnecessary companions to this hopeful generation, by the talents of\npimping and buffoonery. Though they were universally known, even\nby those they preyed upon to have no other means of earning their\nlivelihood, than the most infamous and fraudulent practices, they were\ncaressed and courted by these infatuated dupes, when a man of honour,\nwho would not join in their excesses, would have been treated with the\nutmost indignity and contempt.\n\nThough Peregrine, in his heart, detested those abandoned courses,\nand was a professed enemy to the whole society of gamesters, whom\nhe considered, and always treated, as the foes of humankind, he was\ninsensibly accustomed to licentious riot, and even led imperceptibly\ninto play by those cormorants, who are no less dangerous in the art of\ncheating, than by their consummate skill in working up the passions of\nunwary youth. They are, for the most part, naturally cool, phlegmatic,\nand crafty, and, by a long habit of dissimulation, have gained an\nabsolute dominion over the hasty passions of the heart; so that they\nengage with manifest advantage over the impatience and impetuosity of a\nwarm undesigning temper, like that of our young gentleman, who, when he\nwas heated with wine, misled by example, invited on one hand, and\ndefied on the other, forgot all his maxims of caution and sobriety, and,\nplunging into the reigning folly of the place, had frequent occasions\nto moralize in the morning upon the loss of the preceding night. These\npenitential reflections were attended with many laudable resolutions of\nprofiting by the experience which he had so dearly purchased; but he\nwas one of those philosophers who always put off till another day the\ncommencement of their reformation.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXVI.\n\n\n\nPeregrine receives a letter from Hatchway, in consequence of which he\nrepairs to the Garrison, and performs the last Offices to his Aunt--He\nis visited by Mr. Gauntlet, who invites him to his Marriage.\n\n\nIn this circle of amusements our hero's time was parcelled out, and\nfew young gentlemen of the age enjoyed life with greater relish,\nnotwithstanding those intervening checks of reason, which served only\nto whet his appetite for a repetition of the pleasures she so prudently\ncondemned; when he received the following letter, by which he was\ndetermined to visit his estate in the country:\n\n     Cousin Pickle,--I hope you are in a better trim than your\n     aunt, who hath been fast moored to her bed these seven weeks,\n     by several feet of under-water lodging in her hold and\n     hollop, whereby I doubt her planks are rotted, so that she\n     cannot choose but fall to pieces in a short time. I have\n     done all in my power to keep her tight and easy, and free\n     from sudden squalls that might overstrain her. And here\n     have been the doctors, who have scuttled her lower deck, and\n     let out six gallons of water. For my own part, I wonder how\n     the devil it came there; for you know as how it was a liquor\n     she never took in. But as for those fellows the doctors, they\n     are like unskilful carpenters, that in mending one leak make\n     a couple; and so she fills again apace. But the worst sign of\n     all is this here, she won't let a drop of Nantz go between\n     the combings of her teeth, and has quite lost the rudder of\n     her understanding, whereby she yaws woundily in her speech\n     palavering about some foreign part called the New Geereusalem,\n     and wishing herself in a safe berth in the river Geordun.\n     The parson, I must say, strives to keep her steady, concerning\n     the navigation of her soul, and talks very sensibly of charity\n     and the poor, whereof she hath left a legacy of two hundred\n     pounds in her will. And here has been Mr. Gamaliel and your\n     brother my lord, demanding entrance at the gate, in order to\n     see her; but I would not suffer them to come aboard, and\n     pointed my patereroes, which made them sheer off. Your sister,\n     Mrs. Clover, keeps close watch upon her kinswoman, without\n     ever turning in, and a kind-hearted young woman it is. I\n     should be glad to see you at the garrison, if the wind of your\n     inclination sits that way; and mayhap it may be a comfort to\n     your aunt, to behold you alongside of her, when her anchor is\n     apeak. So no more at present, but rests your friend and humble\n     servant to command,                        \u00e2\u0080\u009cJohn Hatchway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNext morning, after the receipt of this epistle, Peregrine, in order to\nmanifest his regard to his aunt, as well as his friendship for honest\nJack, set out on horseback for their habitation, attended by Pipes, who\nlonged to see his old messmate; but before he had reached the garrison,\nMrs. Hatchway had given up the ghost, in the threescore and fifth year\nof her age. The widower seemed to bear his loss with resignation, and\nbehaved very decently upon the occasion, though he did not undergo those\ndangerous transports of sorrow, which some tender-hearted husbands have\nfelt at the departure of their wives. The lieutenant was naturally a\nphilosopher, and so well disposed to acquiesce in the dispensations of\nProvidence, that in this, as well as in every other emergency of his\nlife, he firmly believed, that everything which happened was for the\nbest.\n\nPeregrine's task, therefore, was not so great in comforting him, as in\nconsoling his own sister, who, with great poignancy and sincerity\nof grief, lamented the death of the only relation with whom she had\nmaintained any intimacy of correspondence; for her mother was as\nimplacable as ever, in her enmity against her and Peregrine, and rather\nmore determined in her rancour; that which was originally a sudden\ntransport of indignation, being by this time settled into a confirmed\ninveteracy of hate. As for Gam, who was now dignified by the country\npeople with the appellation of the young squire, he still acted in the\ncapacity of minister to the caprice and vengeance of his mother,\ntaking all opportunities of disturbing Julia's peace, slandering her\nreputation, and committing outrages against the tenants and domestics of\nher husband, who was a man of quiet and timorous disposition.\n\nBut the chief amusement of young Pickle, in his later years, was\nthe chase, in which he acquired some renown by his intrepidity and\nremarkable figure, which improved every day in deformity; insomuch,\nas to suggest a ludicrous scheme of revenge to a gentleman in the\nneighbourhood. Having been affronted by the insolence of Crookback,\nhe clothed a large baboon that was in his possession, in a dress that\nresembled the hunting equipage of Gam; and ordering the animal to be set\nastride, and tied upon the back of his keenest hunter, turned them out\none day after the hounds. The horse in a little time outstripping all\nthe rest in the field, the rider was mistaken for Gam by the whole\ncompany, who saluted him as he passed with a halloo, observing, that\nthe squire had his usual good luck, in being better mounted than his\nneighbours. Pickle afterwards appearing in his own person, created\ngreat astonishment in the spectators, one of whom asked if he had split\nhimself in twain, and pointed out his representative, who was, by this\ntime, almost up with the hounds. Upon which the identical Gam went in\npursuit of the impostor. When he overtook him, he was so much enraged at\nthe counterfeit, that he attacked the baboon whip in hand, and, in all\nprobability, would have sacrificed him to his resentment, had not he\nbeen prevented by the other fox-hunters. They interposed, in order\nto make up the difference betwixt two brothers of the sport, and were\nequally surprised and diverted when they distinguished the quality of\nCrookback's antagonist, which they rescued from his rage, and reconveyed\nto its master.\n\nPeregrine, at the request of his friend Jack, took charge of his aunt's\nfuneral, to which his parents were invited, though they did not think\nproper to appear, or pay the least regard to his solicitations, when\nhe desired permission to wait upon them in person. Nevertheless, old\nGamaliel, at the instigation of his wife, afterwards obtained an order\nfrom Doctors' Commons, obliging Hatchway to produce the will of his\nwife, on the supposition that she had bequeathed to him some part of the\nmoney, which, he knew, was at her own disposal. But from this step he\nreaped no other satisfaction than that of finding himself altogether\nneglected by the testatrix, who had left all her effects to her husband,\nexcept one thousand pounds, with her jewels, to Julia's daughter,\nthe benefaction mentioned in the lieutenant's letter, and some\ninconsiderable legacies to her favourite domestics.\n\nA few days after the interment of this good lady, our hero was agreeably\nsurprised with a visit from his friend Godfrey, who had come to England\nin consequence of that promotion which he owed to his interest, though\nthe soldier himself placed it to the credit of a certain courtier who\nhad formerly promised to befriend him, and now finding his advancement\nunowned, very modestly arrogated the merit of it to himself. He\ncommunicated his good-fortune to Pickle, who complimented him upon it as\nan event of which he had no precognition; and at the same time told\nhim, that, in consequence of his preferment, his cousin at Windsor had\nconsented to his being immediately united in the bands of wedlock with\nhis lovely Sophy; that the wedding-day was already fixed; and that\nnothing would be wanting to his happiness, if Peregrine would honour the\nnuptials with his presence.\n\nOur hero accepted the invitation with great eagerness, when he learned\nthat Emilia would be there in quality of bridesmaid; and now repeated\nwhat he had formerly written to his friend, namely, that he was not only\nwilling, but extremely impatient to atone for his mad behaviour to that\nyoung lady, by laying himself and his whole fortune at her feet. Godfrey\nthanked him for his honourable intention, and promised to use his\ninfluence, and that of Sophy, in his behalf, though he seemed dubious\nof their success, on account of his sister's delicacy which could not\npardon the least shadow of disrespect. He owned, indeed, he was not\ncertain that she would appear in the same company with Pickle; but, as\nshe made no stipulation on that score, he would interpret her silence\nin the most favourable manner, and keep her in ignorance of his design,\nuntil she should find it too late to retract with any decency. The hope\nof seeing and conversing with Emilia, and perhaps of being reconciled\nto her, after having suffered so much and so long from her displeasure,\nraised a tumult of ideas in his breast, and produced a strange\ninquietude of joy and perturbation. Gauntlet having stayed with him a\nfew days, and signified the time appointed for his spousals, took his\nleave, in order to prepare for the occasion; while Peregrine, with his\nfriend Hatchway, made a tour among his acquaintance in the country, with\na view of sounding their inclinations touching a project which he had\nlately conceived, of offering himself as a candidate for a certain\nborough in the neighbourhood, at the ensuing election for members of\nparliament.\n\nThis scheme, which was suggested to him by one of his quality patrons,\nwould have succeeded according to his wish, had the election taken place\nimmediately; but, before that happened, his interest was overbalanced\nby some small accidents that will be recorded in the sequel. In the\nmeantime, he repaired to Windsor on the eve of his friend's marriage,\nand understood from Godfrey that it was with the utmost difficulty he\nand Sophy could prevail upon his sister to be present at the wedding.\nwhen she was informed that her lover was invited; and that her consent\nhad not been obtained until they had promised, on the part of Peregrine,\nthat he should not renew the old topic, nor even speak to her in the\nstyle of a former acquaintance.\n\nOur young gentleman was nettled at this preliminary, to which, however,\nhe said he would adhere; and so well did he think himself fortified with\npride and resentment, that he resolved to behave towards her with such\nindifference, as would, he hoped, mortify her vanity, and thereby\npunish her for the implacability of her disposition. Armed with these\nsentiments, he was next day introduced by Godfrey to the bride, who\nreceived him with her usual sweetness of temper and affability; and\nEmilia being present, he saluted her with a distant bow, which she\nacknowledged with a cold courtesy, and an aspect of ice. Though\nthis deportment confirmed his displeasure, her beauty undermined his\nresolution; he thought her charms infinitely improved since their last\nparting, and a thousand fond images recurring to his imagination, he\nfelt his whole soul dissolving into tenderness and love.\n\nIn order to banish those dangerous ideas, he endeavoured to enter into a\ngay conversation with Sophy, on the subject of the approaching ceremony;\nbut his tongue performed its office awkwardly, his eyes were attracted\ntowards Emilia, as if they had been subject to the power of fascination;\nin spite of all his efforts, a deep sigh escaped from his bosom, and\nhis whole appearance indicated anxiety and confusion. The bridegroom,\nperceiving his condition, abridged the visit, and having conducted his\ncompanion to his own lodgings, expressed his concern at having been the\ninnocent occasion of his uneasiness, by exposing him to the sight of\nEmilia, which he perceived had given him pain. Peregrine, who had by\nthis time recollected the dictates of his pride, assured him, that he\nwas very much mistaken in the cause of his disorder, which was no other\nthan a sudden qualm, to which he had been for some time subject; and to\nshow him how philosophically he could bear the disdain of Emilia, which,\nwith all deference to her conduct, he could not help thinking a little\ntoo severe, he desired, as the bridegroom had made preparation for a\nprivate ball in the evening, that he would provide him with an agreeable\npartner; in which case he would exhibit undoubted proofs of the\ntranquility of his heart. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was in hopes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Godfrey, \u00e2\u0080\u009cof being\nable, with the assistance of Sophy, to make up matters between you and\nmy sister, and for that reason kept her unengaged to any other gentleman\nfor the night; but since she was so peevishly obstinate, I shall take\ncare to accommodate you with a very handsome young lady, whose partner\nwill not be sorry to exchange her for Emilia.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe thoughts of having an opportunity to coquette with another woman,\nunder the eye of this implacable mistress, supported his spirits during\nthe ceremony, which put Gauntlet in possession of his heart's desire;\nand, by means of this cordial, he found himself so undisturbed at\ndinner, though he sat opposite to his fair enemy, that he was able\nto pass some occasional jokes upon the new-married couple, with some\nappearance of mirth and good-humour. Nor did Emily any otherwise seem\naffected by his presence, than by excepting him from the participation\nof those genial regards which she distributed to the rest of the\ncompany. This easiness of behaviour on her side reinforced his\nresolution, by giving him pretence to call her sensibility in question;\nfor he could not conceive how any woman of acute feelings could sit\nunmoved in presence of a man with whom she had such recent and intimate\nconnection; not considering that she had much more reason to condemn his\naffectation of unconcern, and that her external deportment might, like\nhis own, be an effort of pride and resentment.\n\nThis contest, in point of dissimulation, continued till night, when the\ncompany was paired for dancing, and Peregrine began the ball by walking\na minuet with the bride; then he took out the young lady to whom he was\nrecommended by Gauntlet, being very well pleased to see that her person\nwas such as might have inspired even Emily herself with jealousy,\nthough, at the same time, he perceived his mistress coupled with a gay\nyoung officer, whom, with all due deference to his own qualifications,\nhe considered as no despicable rival. However, he himself first began\nhostilities, by becoming all of a sudden particular with his partner,\nwhom he forthwith assailed with flattering compliments, that soon\nintroduced the subject of love, upon which he expatiated with great\nart and elocution, using not only the faculty of speech, but also the\nlanguage of the eyes, in which he was a perfect connoisseur.\n\nThis behaviour soon manifested itself to the whole assembly, the\ngreatest part of whom believed that he was in good earnest captivated\nby the charms of his partner; while Emilia, penetrating into his\ndesign, turned his own artillery upon himself, by seeming to listen with\npleasure to the addresses of his rival, who was no novice in the art of\nmaking love. She even affected uncommon vivacity, and giggled aloud at\nevery whisper which he conveyed into her ear, insomuch that she, in\nher turn, afforded speculation to the company, who imagined the young\nsoldier had made a conquest of the bridegroom's sister. Pickle\nhimself began to cherish the same opinion, which gradually invaded his\ngood-humour, and at length filled his bosom with rage. He strove to\nsuppress his indignation, and called every consideration of vanity\nand revenge to his aid. He endeavoured to wean his eyes from the fatal\nobject that disturbed him, but they would not obey his direction and\ncommand. He wished himself deprived of all sensation, when he heard\nher laugh, and saw her smile upon the officer; and, in the course of\ncountry-dancing, when he was obliged to join hands with her, the touch\nthrilled through all his nerves, and kindled a flame within him which he\ncould not contain. In a word, his endeavours to conceal the situation of\nhis thoughts were so violent, that his constitution could not endure the\nshock; the sweat ran down his forehead in a stream, the colour vanished\nfrom his cheeks, his knees began to totter, and his eyesight to fail; so\nthat he must have fallen at his full length upon the floor, had not he\nretired very abruptly into another room, where he threw himself upon a\ncouch, and fainted.\n\nIn this condition he was found by his friend, who, seeing him withdraw\nwith such symptoms of disorder, followed him thither; and, when he\nrecovered the use of his faculties, pressed him to make use of a bed in\nthat house, rather than expose himself in the night air, by going home\nto his own lodgings; but not being able to prevail upon him to accept\nthe offer, he wrapped him up in a cloak, and, conducting him to the\ninn where he lodged, helped him to undress and go to bed, where he was\nimmediately seized with a violent fit of the ague. Godfrey behaved with\ngreat tenderness, and would have actually borne him company all night,\nnotwithstanding the circumstances of his own situation, had not his\nfriend insisted upon his returning to the company, and making his\napology to his partner for his sudden departure. This was a step\nabsolutely necessary towards maintaining the quiet of the assembly,\nwhich he found in great consternation, occasioned by his absence; for\nsome of the ladies, seeing the bridegroom follow the stranger in his\nretreat, the meaning of which they did not comprehend, began to be\nafraid of a quarrel. Emilia, upon pretence of that supposition, was so\nmuch alarmed, that she could not stand, and was fain to have recourse to\na smelling-bottle.\n\nThe bride, who understood the whole mystery, was the only person that\nacted with deliberation and composure; she imputed Emilia's disorder to\nthe right cause, which was no other than concern for the condition of\nher lover, and assured the ladies there was nothing extraordinary in Mr.\nPickle's going off, he being subject to fainting fits, by which he was\noften overtaken without any previous notice. The arrival of Gauntlet\nconfirmed the truth of this declaration. He made an apology to the\ncompany in the name of his friend, who, he told them, was suddenly\ntaken ill; and they returned to their diversion of dancing, with this\nvariation: Emilia was so disordered and fatigued, that she begged to\nbe excused from continuing the exercise; and Peregrine's partner\nbeing disengaged, was paired with the young officer, for whom she\nwas originally designed. Meanwhile, the bride withdrew into another\napartment with her sister, and expostulated with her upon her cruelty\nto Mr. Pickle, assuring her, from Godfrey's information, that he had\nundergone a severe fit on her account, which, in all likelihood\nwould have a dangerous effect upon his constitution. Though Emily was\ninflexible in her answers to the kind remonstrances of the gentle\nSophy, her heart was melting with the impressions of pity and love; and,\nfinding herself unable to perform the duty of her function, in putting\nthe bride to bed, she retired to her own chamber, and in secret\nsympathized with the distemper of her lover.\n\nIn the morning, as early as decency would permit him to leave the arms\nof his dear wife, Captain Gauntlet made a visit to Peregrine, who had\npassed a very tedious and uneasy night, having been subject to short\nintervals of delirium, during which Pipes had found it very difficult to\nkeep him fast belayed. He owned indeed to Godfrey, that his imagination\nhad been haunted by the ideas of Emilia and her officer, which tormented\nhim to an unspeakable degree of anguish and distraction; and that\nhe would rather suffer death than a repetition of such excruciating\nreflections. He was, however, comforted by his friend, who assured\nhim, that his sister's inclinations would in time prevail over all the\nendeavours of resentment and pride, illustrating this asseveration by an\naccount of the manner in which she was affected by the knowledge of\nhis disorder, and advising him to implore the mediation of Sophy, in a\nletter which she should communicate to Emilia.\n\nThis was an opportunity which our hero thought too favourable to be\nneglected: calling for paper, he sat up in his bed, and, in the first\ntransports of his emotion, wrote the following petition to Godfrey's\namiable wife:--\n\n     Dear Madam--The affliction of a contrite heart can never\n     appeal to your benevolence in vain, and, therefore, I\n     presume to approach you in this season of delight, with\n     the language of sorrow, requesting that you will espouse\n     the cause of an unhappy lover, who mourns with unutterable\n     anguish over his ruined hope, and intercede for my pardon\n     with that divine creature, whom, in the intemperance and\n     excess of passion, I have so mortally offended. Good Heaven!\n     is my guilt inexpiable? Am I excluded from all hope of\n     remission? Am I devoted to misery and despair? I have\n     offered all the atonement which the most perfect and sincere\n     penitence could suggest, and she rejects my humility and\n     repentance. If her resentment would pursue me to the grave,\n     let her signify her pleasure; and may I be branded with the\n     name of villain, and remembered with infamy and detestation\n     to all posterity, if I hesitate one moment in sacrificing a\n     life which is odious to Emilia. Ah! madam, while I thus pour\n     forth the effusions of my grief and distraction, I look\n     around the apartment in which I lie, and every well-known\n     object that salutes my view, recalls to my remembrance that\n     fond, that happy day, on which the fair, the good, the\n     tender-hearted Sophy became my advocate, though I was a\n     stranger to her acquaintance, and effected a transporting\n     reconciliation between me and that same enchanting beauty,\n     that is now so implacably incensed. If she is not satisfied\n     with the pangs of remorse and disappointment, the transports\n     of madness I have undergone, let her prescribe what further\n     penance she thinks I ought to endure, and when I decline her\n     sentence, let me be the object of her eternal disdain.\n\n     I commit myself, dear madam! dear Sophy! dear partner of my\n     Friend! to your kind interposition. I know you will manage\n     my cause, as a concern on which my happiness entirely\n     depends; and I hope everything from your compassion and\n     beneficence, while I fear everything from her rigour and\n     barbarity. Yes! I call it barbarity, a savageness of delicacy\n     altogether inconsistent with the tenderness of human nature;\n     and may the most abject contempt be my portion, if I live\n     under its scourge! But I begin to rave. I conjure you by your\n     own humanity and sweetness of disposition, I conjure you by\n     your love for the man whom Heaven hath decreed your protector,\n     to employ your influence with that angel of wrath, in behalf\n     of your obliged and obedient servant.             \u00e2\u0080\u009cP. PICKLE.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis epistle was immediately transmitted by Godfrey to his wife, who\nperused it with marks of the most humane sympathy; and, carrying it\ninto her sister's chamber, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere is something,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, presenting the\npaper, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich I must recommend to your serious attention.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Emilia, who\nimmediately guessed the meaning of this address, absolutely refused to\nlook upon it, or even to hear it read, till her brother, entering her\napartment, reprimanded her sharply for her obstinacy and pride, accused\nher of folly and dissimulation, and entered so warmly into the interests\nof his friend, that she thought him unkind in his remonstrances, and,\nbursting into a flood of tears, reproached him with partiality and\nwant of affection. Godfrey, who entertained the most perfect love and\nveneration for his sister, asked pardon for having given offence, and,\nkissing the drops from her fair eyes, begged she would, for his sake,\nlisten to the declaration of his friend.\n\nThus solicited, she could not refuse to hear the letter, which, when he\nhad repeated, she lamented her own fate in being the occasion of so much\nuneasiness, desired her brother to assure Mr. Pickle that she was not\na voluntary enemy to his peace; on the contrary, she wished him all\nhappiness, though she hoped he would not blame her for consulting her\nown, in avoiding any future explanation or connection with a person\nwhose correspondence she found herself under a necessity to renounce. In\nvain did the new-married couple exhaust their eloquence in attempting\nto prove, that the reparation which our hero had offered was adequate to\nthe injury she had sustained: that in reconciling herself to a penitent\nlover, who subscribed to her own terms of submission, her honour would\nbe acquitted by the most scrupulous and severe judges of decorum;\nand that her inflexibility would be justly ascribed to the pride\nand insensibility of her heart. She turned a deaf ear to all their\narguments, exhortations, and entreaties, and threatened to leave the\nhouse immediately, if they would not promise to drop that subject of\ndiscourse.\n\nGodfrey, very much chagrined at the bad success of his endeavours,\nreturned to his friend, and made as favourable a report of the affair,\nas the nature of his conversation with Emilia would permit; but as he\ncould not avoid mentioning her resolution in the close, Peregrine was\nobliged to drink again the bitter draught of disappointment, which put\nhis passions into such a state of agitation, as produced a short ecstasy\nof despair, in which he acted a thousand extravagances. This paroxysm,\nhowever, soon subsided into a settled reserve of gloomy resentment,\nwhich he in secret indulged, detaching himself, as soon as possible,\nfrom the company of the soldier, on pretence of retiring to rest.\n\nWhile he lay ruminating upon the circumstances of his present situation,\nhis friend Pipes, who knew the cause of his anxiety, and firmly believed\nthat Emilia loved his master at her heart, howsoever she might attempt\nto disguise her sentiments; I say, Thomas was taken with a conceit\nwhich he thought would set everything to rights, and therefore put it in\nexecution without further delay. Laying aside his hat, he ran directly\nto the house of Sophy's father, and, affecting an air of surprise and\nconsternation, to which he had never before been subject, thundered at\nthe door with such an alarming knock, as in a moment brought the whole\nfamily into the hall. When he was admitted, he began to gape, stare, and\npant at the same time, and made no reply, when Godfrey asked what was\nthe matter, till Mrs. Gauntlet expressed her apprehensions about his\nmaster. When Pickle's name was mentioned, he seemed to make an effort to\nspeak, and, in a bellowing tone, pronounced, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBrought himself up, split\nmy topsails!\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he pointed to his own neck, and rose upon his\ntiptoes, by way of explaining the meaning of his words.\n\nGodfrey, without staying to ask another question, rushed out, and flew\ntowards the inn, with the utmost horror and concern; while Sophy, who\ndid not rightly understand the language of the messenger, addressing\nherself to him a second time, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope no accident has happened\nto Mr. Pickle?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo accident at all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Tom; \u00e2\u0080\u009che has only hanged\nhimself for love.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These words had scarcely proceeded from his mouth,\nwhen Emilia, who stood listening at the parlour door, shrieked aloud,\nand dropped down senseless upon the floor; while her sister, who\nwas almost equally shocked at the intelligence, had recourse to the\nassistance of her maid, by whom she was supported from falling. Pipes,\nhearing Emily's voice, congratulated himself upon the success of his\nstratagem. He sprung to her assistance, and, lifting her up into an easy\nchair, stood by her, until he saw her recover from her swoon, and heard\nher call upon his master's name, with all the frenzy of despairing love.\nThen he bent his course back to the inn, overjoyed at the opportunity of\ntelling Peregrine what a confession he had extorted from his mistress,\nand extremely vain of this proof of his own sagacity.\n\nIn the meantime Godfrey arriving at the house in which he supposed this\nfatal catastrophe had happened, ran upstairs to Peregrine's chamber,\nwithout staying to make any inquiry below; and, finding the door locked,\nburst it open with one stroke of his foot. But what was his amazement,\nwhen, upon entrance, our hero, starting up from the bed, saluted him\nwith a boisterous exclamation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cZounds! who's there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He was struck\ndumb with astonishment, which also riveted him to the place where he\nstood, scarce crediting the testimony of his own senses, till Peregrine,\nwith an air of discontent, which denoted him displeased with his\nintrusion, dispelled his apprehension by a second address, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nsee you consider me as a friend, by your using me without ceremony.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n The soldier, thus convinced of the falsehood of the information he had\nreceived, began to imagine, that Pickle had projected the plan which was\nexecuted by his servant; and looking upon it as a piece of unjustifiable\nfinesse, which might be attended with very melancholy consequences to\nhis sister or wife, he answered, in a supercilious tone, that Mr.\nPickle must blame himself for the interruption of his repose, which was\nentirely owing to the sorry jest he had set on foot.\n\nPickle, who was the child of passion, and more than half mad with\nimpatience before this visit, hearing himself treated in such a cavalier\nmanner, advanced close up to Godfrey's breast, and assuming a stern, or\nrather frantic countenance, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHark ye, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are mistaken\nif you think I jest; I am in downright earnest, I assure you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gauntlet,\nwho was not a man to be browbeaten, seeing himself thus bearded by a\nperson of whose conduct he had, he thought, reason to complain, put on\nhis military look of defiance, and, erecting his chest, replied with\nan exalted voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Pickle, whether you were in jest or earnest,\nyou must give me leave to tell you, that the scheme was childish,\nunseasonable, and unkind, not to give it a harsher term.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cDeath, sir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n cried our adventurer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou trifle with my disquiet; if there is any\nmeaning in your insinuation, explain yourself, and then I shall know\nwhat answer it will befit me to give.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI came with very different\nsentiments,\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed the soldier, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut since you urge me to\nexpostulation, and behave with such unprovoked loftiness of displeasure,\nI will, without circumlocution, tax you with having committed an outrage\nupon the peace of my family, in sending your fellow to alarm us with\nsuch an abrupt account of your having done violence upon yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Peregrine, confounded at this imputation, stood silent, with a most\nsavage aspect of surprise, eager to know the circumstance to which\nhis accuser alluded, and incensed to find it beyond the sphere of his\ncomprehension.\n\nWhile these two irritated friends stood fronting each other with mutual\nindignation in their eyes and attitudes, they were joined by Pipes, who,\nwithout taking the least notice of the situation in which he found them,\ntold his master, that he might up with the top-gallant masts of his\nheart, and out with his rejoicing pendants; for as to Miss Emily, he\nhad clapped her helm aweather, the vessel wore, and now she was upon the\nother tack, standing right into the harbour of his good-will. Peregrine,\nwho was not yet a connoisseur in the terms of his lacquey, commanded\nhim, upon pain of his displeasure, to be more explicit in his\nintelligence; and by dint of divers questions, obtained a perfect\nknowledge of the scheme which he had put in execution for his service.\nThis information perplexed him not a little; he would have chastised\nhis servant upon the spot for his temerity, had he not plainly perceived\nthat the fellow's intention was to promote his case and satisfaction;\nand, on the other hand, he knew not how to acquit himself of the\nsuspicion which he saw Godfrey entertain of his being the projector of\nthe plan, without condescending to an explanation, which his present\ndisposition could not brook. After some pause, however, turning to Pipes\nwith a severe frown, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRascal!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is the second time I have\nsuffered in the opinion of that lady, by your ignorance and presumption;\nif ever you intermeddle in my affairs for the future, without express\norder and direction, by all that's sacred, I will put you to death\nwithout mercy! Away, and let my horse be saddled this instant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPipes having withdrawn, in order to perform this piece of duty, our\nyoung gentleman, addressing himself again to the soldier, and laying\nhis hand upon his breast, said, with a solemnity of regard, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCaptain\nGauntlet, upon my honour, I am altogether innocent of that shallow\ndevice which you impute to my invention; and I don't think you do\njustice either to my intellect or honour, in supposing me capable of\nsuch insolent absurdity. As for your sister, I have once in my life\naffronted her in the madness and impetuosity of desire; but I have made\nsuch acknowledgments, and offered such atonement, as few women of her\nsphere would have refused; and before God I am determined to endure\nevery torment of disappointment and despair, rather than prostrate\nmyself again to the cruelty of her unjustifiable pride.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he\nstalked suddenly down-stairs, and took horse immediately, his spirits\nbeing supported by resentment, which prompted him to vow within himself,\nthat he would seek consolation for the disdain of Emilia, in the\npossession of the first willing wench he should meet upon the road.\n\nWhile he set out for the garrison with these sentiments, Gauntlet, in a\nsuspense between anger, shame, and concern, returned to the house of his\nfather-in-law, where he found his sister still violently agitated\nfrom the news of Peregrine's death; the mystery of which he forthwith\nunravelled, recounting at the same time the particulars of the\nconversation which had happened at the inn, and describing the demeanour\nof Pickle with some expressions of asperity, which were neither\nagreeable to Emilia, nor approved by the gentle Sophy, who tenderly chid\nhim, for allowing Peregrine to depart in terms of misunderstanding.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXVII.\n\n\n\nPeregrine sets out for the Garrison, and meets with a Nymph of the Road,\nwhom he takes into Keeping, and metamorphoses into a fine Lady.\n\n\nIn the meantime, our hero jogged along in a profound reverie, which\nwas disturbed by a beggar-woman and her daughter, who solicited him\nfor alms, as he passed them on the road. The girl was about the age\nof sixteen, and, notwithstanding the wretched equipage in which she\nappeared, exhibited to his view a set of agreeable features, enlivened\nwith the complexion of health and cheerfulness. The resolution I have\nalready mentioned was still warm in his imagination; and he looked upon\nthis young mendicant as a very proper object for the performance of his\nvow. He, therefore, entered into a conference with the mother, and for\na small sum of money purchased her property in the wench, who did not\nrequire much courtship and entreaty, before she consented to accompany\nhim to any place that he should appoint for her habitation.\n\nThis contract being settled to his satisfaction, he ordered Pipes to\nseat his acquisition behind him upon the crupper, and, alighting at the\nfirst public-house which they found upon the road, he wrote a letter to\nHatchway, desiring him to receive this hedge inamorata, and direct her\nto be cleaned and clothed in a decent manner, with all expedition, so\nthat she should be touchable upon his arrival, which, on that account,\nhe would defer for the space of one day. This billet, together with\nthe girl, he committed to the charge of Pipes, after having laid strong\ninjunctions upon him to abstain from all attempts upon her chastity,\nand ordered him to make the best of his way to the garrison, while he\nhimself crossed the country to a market town, where he proposed to spend\nthe night.\n\nTom, thus cautioned, proceeded with his charge, and, being naturally\ntaciturn, opened not his lips, until he had performed the best half of\nhis journey. But Thomas, notwithstanding his irony appearance, was in\nreality composed of flesh and blood. His desire being titillated by\nthe contact of a buxom wench, whose right arm embraced his middle as he\nrode, his thoughts began to mutiny against his master, and he found\nit almost impossible to withstand the temptation of making love.\nNevertheless, he wrestled with these rebellious suggestions with all\nthe reason that Heaven had enabled him to exert; and that being totally\novercome, his victorious passion suddenly broke out in this address:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c'Sblood! I believe master thinks I have no more stuff in my body than\na dried haddock, to turn me adrift in the dark with such a spanker. D'ye\nthink he don't, my dear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d To this question his fellow-traveller replied,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSwanker anan!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And the lover resumed his suit, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOons! how you\ntickle my timber! Something shoots from your arm, through my stowage,\nto the very keelstone. Han't you got quicksilver in your\nhand?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuicksilver!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cd--n the silver that has crossed\nmy hand this month; d'ye think, if I had silver, I shouldn't buy me a\nsmock?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAdsooks! you baggage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the lover, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou shouldn't want\na smock nor a petticoat neither, if you could have a kindness for a\ntrue-hearted sailor, as sound and strong as a nine-inch cable, that\nwould keep all clear above board, and everything snug under the\nhatches.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cCurse your gum!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the charmer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat's your gay balls\nand your hatches to me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo but let us bring-to a little,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nthe wooer, whose appetite was by this time whetted to a most ravenous\ndegree, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I'll teach you to box the compass, my dear. Ah! you\nstrapper, what a jolly b-- you are!\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cB--!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed this modern\ndulcinea, incensed at the opprobrious term; \u00e2\u0080\u009csuch a b-- as your mother,\nyou dog! D-- you, I've a good mind to box your jaws instead of your\ncomepiss. I'll let you know, as how I am meat for your master, you saucy\nblackguard. You are worse than a dog, you old flinty-faced, flea-bitten\nscrub. A dog wears his own coat, but you wear your master's.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSuch a torrent of disgraceful epithets from a person who had no clothes\nat all, converted the gallant's love into choler, and he threatened to\ndismount and seize her to a tree, when she should have a taste of\nhis cat-o'-nine-tails athwart her quarters; but, instead of being\nintimidated by his menaces, she set him at defiance, and held forth with\nsuch a flow of eloquence, as would have entitled her to a considerable\nshare of reputation, even among the nymphs of Billingsgate; for this\nyoung lady, over and above a natural genius for altercation, had her\ntalents cultivated among the venerable society of weeders, podders, and\nhoppers, with whom she had associated from her tender years. No wonder,\nthen, that she soon obtained a complete victory over Pipes, who, as the\nreader may have observed, was very little addicted to the exercise of\nspeech. Indeed, he was utterly disconcerted by her volubility of tongue;\nand, being altogether unfurnished with answers to the distinct periods\nof her discourse, very wisely chose to save himself the expense of\nbreath and argument, by giving her a full swing of cable, so that she\nmight bring herself up; while he rode onwards, in silent composure,\nwithout taking any more notice of his fair fellow-traveller, than if she\nhad been his master's cloak-bag.\n\nIn spite of all the despatch he could make, it was late before he\narrived at the garrison, where he delivered the letter and the lady to\nthe lieutenant, who no sooner understood the intention of his friend,\nthan he ordered all the tubs in the house to be carried into the hall,\nand filled with water. Tom having provided himself with swabs and\nbrushes, divested the fair stranger of her variegated drapery, which\nwas immediately committed to the flames, and performed upon her soft and\nsleek person the ceremony of scrubbing, as it is practised on board of\nthe king's ships of war. Yet the nymph herself did not submit to this\npurification without repining. She cursed the director, who was upon the\nspot, with many abusive allusions to his wooden leg; and as for Pipes\nthe operator, she employed her talons so effectually upon his face, that\nthe blood ran over his nose in sundry streams; and next morning, when\nthose rivulets were dry, his countenance resembled the rough bark of a\nplum-tree, plastered with gum. Nevertheless, he did his duty with great\nperseverance, cut off her hair close to the scalp, handled his brushes\nwith dexterity, applied his swabs of different magnitude and texture, as\nthe case required; and, lastly, rinsed the whole body with a dozen pails\nof cold water, discharged upon her head.\n\nThese ablutions being executed, he dried her with towels, accommodated\nher with a clean shift, and, acting the part of a valet-de-chambre,\nclothed her from head to foot, in clean and decent apparel which had\nbelonged to Mrs. Hatchway; by which means her appearance was altered\nso much for the better, that when Peregrine arrived next day, he could\nscarce believe his own eyes. He was, for that reason, extremely well\npleased with his purchase, and now resolved to indulge a whim, which\nseized him at the very instant of his arrival.\n\nHe had, as I believe the reader will readily allow, made considerable\nprogress in the study of character, from the highest rank to the most\nhumble station of life, and found it diversified in the same manner,\nthrough every degree of subordination and precedency: nay, he moreover\nobserved, that the conversation of those who are dignified with the\nappellation of polite company, is neither more edifying nor entertaining\nthan that which is met with among the lower classes of mankind; and that\nthe only essential difference, in point of demeanour, is the form of an\neducation, which the meanest capacity can acquire, without much study or\napplication. Possessed of this notion, he determined to take the young\nmendicant under his own tutorage and instruction. In consequence of\nwhich, he hoped he should, in a few weeks, be able to produce her in\ncompany, as an accomplished young lady of uncommon wit, and an excellent\nunderstanding.\n\nThis extravagant plan he forthwith began to execute with great eagerness\nand industry; and his endeavours succeeded even beyond his expectation.\nThe obstacle, in surmounting of which he found the greatest difficulty,\nwas an inveterate habit of swearing, which had been indulged from her\ninfancy, and confirmed by the example of those among whom she had lived.\nHowever, she had the rudiments of good sense from nature, which taught\nher to listen to wholesome advice, and was so docile as to comprehend\nand retain the lessons which her governor recommended to her attention;\ninsomuch, that he ventured, in a few days, to present her at table,\namong a set of country squires, to whom she was introduced as niece to\nthe lieutenant. In that capacity she sat with becoming easiness of mien,\nfor she was as void of the mauvaise honte as any duchess in the land;\nbowed very graciously to the compliments of the gentlemen; and though\nshe said little or nothing, because she was previously cautioned on that\nscore, she more than once gave way to laughter, and her mirth happened\nto be pretty well timed. In a word, she attracted the applause and\nadmiration of the guests, who, after she was withdrawn, complimented Mr.\nHatchway upon the beauty, breeding, and good-humour of his kinswoman.\n\nBut what contributed more than any other circumstance to her speedy\nimprovement, was some small insight into the primer, which she had\nacquired at a day-school, during the life of her father, who was a\nday-labourer in the country. Upon this foundation did Peregrine build\na most elegant superstructure; he culled out choice sentences from\nShakespeare, Otway, and Pope, and taught her to repeat them with an\nemphasis and theatrical cadence. He then instructed her in the names\nand epithets of the most celebrated players, which he directed her\nto pronounce occasionally, with an air of careless familiarity; and,\nperceiving that her voice was naturally clear, he enriched it with\nremnants of opera tunes, to be hummed during a pause in conversation,\nwhich is generally supplied with a circulation of a pinch of snuff.\nBy means of this cultivation she became a wonderful proficient in the\npolite graces of the age; she, with great facility, comprehended the\nscheme of whist, though cribbage was her favourite game, with which she\nhad amused herself in her vacant hours, from her first entrance into the\nprofession of hopping; and brag soon grew familiar to her practice and\nconception.\n\nThus prepared, she was exposed to the company of her own sex, being\nfirst of all visited by the parson's daughter, who could not avoid\nshowing that civility to Mr. Hatchway's niece, after she had made her\npublic appearance at church. Mrs. Clover, who had a great share of\npenetration, could not help entertaining some doubts about this same\nrelation, whose name she had never heard the uncle mention, during the\nwhole term of her residence at the garrison. But as the young lady was\ntreated in that character, she would not refuse her acquaintance; and,\nafter having seen her at the castle, actually invited Miss Hatchway to\nher house. In short, she made a progress through almost all the families\nin the neighbourhood; and by dint of her quotations, which, by the bye,\nwere not always judiciously used, she passed for a sprightly young lady,\nof uncommon learning and taste.\n\nPeregrine having in this manner initiated her in the beau monde of the\ncountry, conducted her to London, where she was provided with private\nlodgings and a female attendant; and put her immediately under the\ntuition of his valet-de-chambre, who had orders to instruct her in\ndancing, and the French language. He attended her to plays and concerts\nthree or four times a week; and when our hero thought her sufficiently\naccustomed to the sight of great company, he squired her in person to\na public assembly, and danced with her among all the gay ladies of\nfashion; not but that there was still an evident air of rusticity and\nawkwardness in her demeanour, which was interpreted into an agreeable\nwildness of spirit, superior to the forms of common breeding. He\nafterwards found means to make her acquainted with some distinguished\npatterns of her own sex, by whom she was admitted into the most elegant\nparties, and continued to make good her pretensions to gentility, with\ngreat circumspection. But one evening, being at cards with a certain\nlady whom she detected in the very fact of unfair conveyance, she taxed\nher roundly with the fraud, and brought upon herself such a torrent of\nsarcastic reproof, as overbore all her maxims of caution, and burst\nopen the floodgates of her own natural repartee, twanged off with the\nappellation of b-- and w--, which she repeated with great vehemence, in\nan attitude of manual defiance, to the terror of her antagonist, and\nthe astonishment of all present; nay, to such an unguarded pitch was she\nprovoked, that, starting up, she snapped her fingers, in testimony of\ndisdain, and, as she quitted the room, applied her hand to that part\nwhich was the last of her that disappeared, inviting the company to kiss\nit by one of its coarsest denominations.\n\nPeregrine was a little disconcerted at this oversight in her behaviour,\nwhich, by the demon of intelligence, was in a moment conveyed to all the\nprivate companies in town; so that she was absolutely excluded from all\npolite communication, and Peregrine, for the present, disgraced among\nthe modest part of his female acquaintance, many of whom not only\nforbade him their houses, on account of the impudent insult he had\ncommitted upon their honour, as well as understanding, in palming a\ncommon trull upon them, as a young lady of birth and education; but\nalso aspersed his family, by affirming that she was actually his own\ncousin-german, whom he had precipitately raised from the most abject\nstate of humility and contempt. In revenge for this calumny, our young\ngentleman explained the whole mystery of her promotion, together with\nthe motives that induced him to bring her into the fashionable world;\nand repeated among his companions the extravagant encomiums which had\nbeen bestowed upon her by the most discerning matrons of the age.\n\nMeanwhile, the infanta herself being rebuked by her benefactor for this\ninstance of misbehaviour, promised faithfully to keep a stricter\nguard for the future over her conduct, and applied herself with great\nassiduity to the studies, in which she was assisted by the Swiss, who\ngradually lost the freedom of his heart, while she was profiting by his\ninstruction. In other words, she made a conquest of her preceptor, who\nyielding to the instigations of the flesh, chose a proper opportunity\nto declare his passion, which was powerfully recommended by his personal\nqualifications; and his intentions being honourable, she listened to his\nproposals of espousing her in private. In consequence of this agreement,\nthey made an elopement together; and, being buckled at the Fleet,\nconsummated their nuptials in private lodgings, by the Seven Dials,\nfrom which the husband next morning sent a letter to our hero begging\nforgiveness for the clandestine step he had taken, which he solemnly\nprotested was not owing to any abatement in his inviolable regard\nfor his master, whom he should always honour and esteem to his latest\nbreath, but entirely to the irresistible charms of the young lady,\nto whom he was now so happy as to be joined in the silken bonds of\nmarriage.\n\nPeregrine, though at first offended at his valet's presumption, was,\nupon second thoughts, reconciled to the event by which he was delivered\nfrom an encumbrance; for by this time he had performed his frolic,\nand began to be tired of his acquisition. He reflected upon the former\nfidelity of the Swiss, which had been manifested in a long course of\nservice and attachment; and, thinking it would be cruelly severe to\nabandon him to poverty and distress for one venial trespass, he resolved\nto pardon what he had done, and enable him in some shape to provide for\nthe family which he had entailed upon himself.\n\nWith these sentiments, he sent a favourable answer to the delinquent,\ndesiring to see him as soon as his passion should permit him to leave\nthe arms of his spouse for an hour or two; and Hadgi, in obedience to\nthis intimation, repaired immediately to the lodgings of his master,\nbefore whom he appeared with a most penitential aspect. Peregrine,\nthough he could scarce help laughing at his rueful length of face,\nreprimanded him sharply, for his disrespect and ingratitude in taking\nthat by stealth which he might have had for asking. The culprit assured\nhim, that next to the vengeance of God, his master's displeasure\nwas that which of all evils he dreaded to incur; but that love had\ndistracted his brain in such a manner, as to banish every other\nconsideration but that of gratifying his desire; and he owned, that he\nshould not have been able to preserve his fidelity and duty to his own\nfather, had they interfered with the interest of his passion. He then\nappealed to his master's own heart for the remission of his guilt,\nalluding to certain circumstances of our hero's conduct, which evinced\nthe desperate effects of love. In short, he made such an apology as\nextorted a smile from his offended judge, who not only forgave his\ntransgression, but also promised to put him in some fair way of earning\na comfortable subsistence.\n\nThe Swiss was so much affected with this instance of generosity, that he\nfell upon his knees, and kissed his hand, praying to heaven, with great\nfervour, to make him worthy of such goodness and condescension.\nHis scheme, he said, was to open a coffee-house and tavern in some\ncreditable part of the town, in hopes of being favoured with the\ncustom of a numerous acquaintance he had made among upper servants and\nreputable tradesmen, not doubting that his wife would be an ornament to\nhis bar, and a careful manager of his affairs. Peregrine approved of the\nplan, towards the execution of which he made him and his wife a present\nof five hundred pounds, together with a promise of erecting a weekly\nclub among his friends, for the reputation and advantage of the house.\n\nHadgi was so transported with his good fortune, that he ran to Pipes,\nwho was in the room, and having hugged him with great cordiality,\nand made his obeisance to his master, hied him home to his bride, to\ncommunicate his happiness, cutting capers, and talking to himself all\nthe way.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXVIII.\n\n\n\nHe is visited by Pallet--Contracts an Intimacy with a Newmarket\nNobleman, and is by the Knowing Ones taken in.\n\n\nThis affair being settled, and our adventurer, for the present, free of\nall female connections, he returned to his former course of fast living\namong the bucks of the town, and performed innumerable exploits among\nwhores, bullies, rooks, constables, and justices of the peace. In\nthe midst of these occupations, he was one morning visited by his old\nfellow-traveller, Pallet, whose appearance gave him equal surprise\nand concern. Though the weather was severe, he was clothed in the\nthin summer dress which he had worn at Paris, and was now, not only\nthreadbare, but, in some parts, actually patched; his stockings, by\na repetition of that practice known among economists by the term of\ncoaxing, hung like pudding-bags about his ankles; his shirt, though new\nwashed, was of the saffron hue, and, in divers places, appeared through\nthe crannies of his breeches; he had exchanged his own hair for a\nsmoke-dried tie-periwig, which all the flour in his dredging-box had\nnot been able to whiten; his eyes were sunk, his jaws lengthened beyond\ntheir usual extension; and he seemed twenty years older than he\nlooked when he and our hero parted at Rotterdam. In spite of all these\nevidences of decay, he accosted him with a meagre affectation of content\nand good-humour, struggled piteously to appear gay and unconcerned,\nprofessed his joy at seeing him in England, excused himself for having\ndelayed so long to come and present his respects; alleging that, since\nhis return, he had been a mere slave to the satisfaction of some persons\nof quality and taste, who had insisted upon his finishing some pieces\nwith the utmost expedition.\n\nPeregrine received him with that compassion and complaisance which was\nnatural to his disposition; inquired about the health of Mrs. Pallet\nand his family, and asked if his friend, the doctor, was in town. The\npainter seemed to have resumed his resentment against that gentleman, of\nwhom he spoke in contemptuous terms. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis so much\novershadowed with presumption and self-conceit, that his merit has no\nrelief. It does not rise. There is no keeping in the picture, my dear\nsir. All the same as if I were to represent the moon under a cloud;\nthere will be nothing but a deep mass of shade, with a little tiny speck\nof light in the middle, which would only serve to make, as it were, the\ndarkness visible. You understand me. Had he taken my advice, it might\nhave been better for him; but he is bigoted to his own opinion. You\nmust know, Mr. Pickle, upon our return to England, I counselled him to\ncompose a little smart, clever ode upon my Cleopatra. As Gad shall judge\nme, I thought it would have been of some service, in helping him out of\nobscurity; for you know, as Sir Richard observes,\n\n     \u00e2\u0080\u009cSoon will that die, which adds thy fame to mine;\n     Let me then live, join'd to a work of thine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the bye, there is a most picturesque contrast in these lines, of thy\nand me, living and dying, and thine and mine. Ah! a prize upon it! Dick,\nafter all, was the man. Ecod! he rounded it off. But, to return to this\nunhappy young man, would you believe it, he tossed up his nose at my\nfriendly proposal, and gabbled something in Greek, which is not worth\nrepeating. The case was this, my dear sir, he was out of humour at the\nneglect of the world. He thought the poets of the age were jealous\nof his genius, and strove to crush it accordingly, while the rest\nof mankind wanted taste sufficient to discern it. For my own part, I\nprofess myself one of these; and, as the clown in Billy Shakespeare says\nof the courtier's oath, had I sworn by the doctor's genius, that the\npancakes were naught, they might have been for all that very good, yet\nshouldn't I have been forsworn. Let that be as it will, he retired from\ntown in great dudgeon, and set up his rest near a hill in Derbyshire,\nwith two tops, resembling Parnassus, and a well at the bottom, which he\nhad christened Hyp-o'-the-Green. Egad! if he stays in that habitation,\n'tis my opinion he'll soon grow green with the hip indeed. He'll be glad\nof an opportunity to return to the fleshpots of Egypt, and pay his court\nto the slighted Queen Cleopatra. Ha! well remembered, by this light!\nyou shall know, my good sir, that this same Egyptian princess has been\ncourted by so many gallants of taste, that, as I hope to live, I found\nmyself in some sort of dilemma, because in parting with her to one, I\nshould have disobliged all his rivals. Now a man would not choose to\ngive offence to his friends, at least I lay it down as a maxim to avoid\nthe smallest appearance of ingratitude. Perhaps I may be in the wrong.\nBut every man has his way. For this reason, I proposed to all the\ncandidates, that a lottery or raffle should be set on foot, by which\nevery individual would have an equal chance for her good graces, and\nthe prize be left to the decision of fortune. The scheme was mightily\nrelished, and the terms being such a trifle as half a guinea, the whole\ntown crowded into my house, in order to subscribe. But there I was their\nhumble servant. 'Gentlemen, you must have a little patience till my\nown particular friends are served.' Among that number, I do myself the\nhonour to consider Mr. Pickle. Here is a copy of the proposals; and, if\nthe list should be adorned with his name, I hope, notwithstanding his\nmerited success among the young ladies, he will for once be shunned by\nthat little vixen called Miss Fortune! he, he, he!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he bowed with a thousand apish congees, and presented his\npaper to Peregrine, who, seeing the number of subscribers was limited to\none hundred, said he thought him too moderate in his expectations, as\nhe did not doubt that his picture would be a cheap purchase at five\nhundred, instead of fifty pounds, at which the price was fixed. To this\nunexpected remark Pallet answered, that among the connoisseurs he would\nnot pretend to appraise his picture; but that, in valuing his works, he\nwas obliged to have an eye to the Gothic ignorance of the age in which\nhe lived. Our adventurer saw at once into the nature of this raffle,\nwhich was no other than a begging shift to dispose of a paltry piece,\nthat he could not otherwise have sold for twenty shillings. However, far\nfrom shocking the poor man in distress, by dropping the least hint\nof his conjecture, he desired to be favoured with six chances, if the\ncircumstances of his plan would indulge him so far; and the painter,\nafter some hesitation, condescended to comply with his request, out of\npure friendship and veneration; though he observed, that, in so doing,\nhe must exclude some of his most intimate companions. Having received\nthe money he gave Pickle his address, desiring he would, with his\nconvenience, visit the princess, who, he was sure, would display her\nmost engaging attractions, in order to captivate his fancy; and took his\nleave extremely well pleased with the success of his application.\n\nThough Peregrine was tempted with the curiosity of seeing this portrait,\nwhich he imagined must contain some analogy to the ridiculous oddity of\nthe painter, he would not expose himself to the disagreeable alternative\nof applauding the performance, contrary to the dictates of conscience\nand common sense, or of condemning it, to the unspeakable mortification\nof the miserable author; and therefore never dreamt of returning the\npainter's visit. Nor did he ever hear of the lottery's being drawn.\nAbout this time he was invited to spend a few weeks at the country seat\nof a certain nobleman, with whom he had contracted an acquaintance,\nin the course of his debauches, which we have already described. His\nlordship being remarkable for his skill and success in horse-racing, his\nhouse was continually filled with the connoisseurs and admirers of that\nsport, upon which the whole conversation turned, insomuch that Peregrine\ngradually imbibed some knowledge in horse-flesh, and the diversions of\nthe course; for the whole occupation of the day, exclusive of eating and\ndrinking, consisted in viewing, managing, and exercising his lordship's\nstud.\n\nOur hero looked upon these amusements with an eye of taste as well as\ncuriosity; he contemplated the animal as a beautiful and elegant part of\nthe creation, and relished the surprising exertion of its speed with\na refined and classical delight. In a little time he became personally\nacquainted with every horse in the stable, and interested himself in the\nreputation of each; while he also gratified his appetite for knowledge,\nin observing the methods of preparing their bodies, and training them to\nthe race. His lordship saw and encouraged his eagerness, from which he\npromised himself some advantage; he formed several private matches for\nhis entertainment, and flattered his discernment, by permitting him to\nbe successful in the first bets he made. Thus was he artfully decoyed\ninto a spirit of keenness and adventure, and disposed to depend upon his\nown judgment, in opposition to that of people who had made horse-racing\nthe sole study of their lives. He accompanied my lord to Newmarket, and,\nentering at once into the genius of the place, was marked as fair game,\nby all the knowing ones there assembled, many of whom found means\nto take him in, in spite of all the cautions and admonitions of his\nlordship, who wanted to reserve him for his own use.\n\nIt is almost impossible for any man, let him be never so fearful or\nphlegmatic, to be an unconcerned spectator in this busy scene. The demon\nof play hovers in the air, like a pestilential vapour, tainting the\nminds of all present with infallible infection, which communicates\nfrom one person to another, like the circulation of a general panic.\nPeregrine was seized with this epidemic distemper to a violent degree;\nand, after having lost a few loose hundreds, in his progress through the\nvarious rookeries of the place, entered into partnership with his noble\nfriend in a grand match, upon the issue of which he ventured no less\nthan three thousand pounds. Indeed he would not have risked such a\nconsiderable sum, had not his own confidence been reinforced by the\nopinion and concurrence of his lordship, who hazarded an equal bet upon\nthe same event. These two associates engaged themselves in the penalty\nof six thousand pounds, to run one chaise and four against another,\nthree times round the course; and our adventurer had the satisfaction of\nseeing his antagonist distanced in the first and second heat; but, all\nof a sudden, one of the horses of his machine was knocked up, by which\naccident the victory was ravished almost from his very grasp, and he was\nobliged to endure the damage and the scorn.\n\nHe was deeply affected with this misfortune, which he imputed to his\nown extravagance and temerity; but discovered no external signs of\naffliction, because his illustrious partner bore his loss with the most\nphilosophic resignation, consoling himself, as well as Pickle, with the\nhope of making it up on some other occasion. Nevertheless, our young\ngentleman could not help admiring, and even envying his equanimity, not\nknowing that his lordship had managed matters so as to be a gainer by\nthe misfortune; which to retrieve, Peregrine purchased several horses,\nat the recommendation of his friend; and, instead of returning to\nLondon, made a tour with him to all the celebrated races in England, at\nwhich, after several vicissitudes of fortune, he made shift, before the\nend of the season, to treble his loss.\n\nBut his hopes seemed to increase with his ill-luck. In the beginning of\nwinter he came to town, fully persuaded that fortune must necessarily\nchange, and that next season he should reap the happy fruits of his\nexperience. In this confidence, he seemed to drown all ideas of prudence\nand economy. His former expense was mere parsimony, compared with that\nwhich he now incurred. He subscribed to the opera, and half a dozen\nconcerts at different parts of the town; was a benefactor to several\nhospitals; purchased a collection of valuable pictures; took a house,\nand furnished it in a most magnificent taste, laid in a large stock\nof French wines, and gave extravagant entertainments to his quality\nfriends, who, in return, loaded him with compliments, and insisted upon\nhis making use of their interest and goodwill.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXIX.\n\n\n\nHe is taken into the Protection of a great Man--Sets up for a Member\nof Parliament--Is disappointed in his Expectation, and finds himself\negregiously outwitted.\n\n\nAmong these professed patrons, the greatest part of whom Peregrine\nsaw through, there was one great personage, who seemed to support with\ndignity the sphere in which fortune had placed him. His behaviour to\nPickle was not a series of grinning complaisance in a flat repetition of\ngeneral expressions of friendship and regard. He demeaned himself with\na seemingly honest reserve, in point of profession; his advances to\nPeregrine appeared to be the result of deliberation and experiment; he\nchid the young gentleman for his extravagance, with the authority of\na parent, and the sincerity of a fast friend; and having, by gradual\ninquiries, made himself acquainted with the state of his private\naffairs, condemned his conduct with an air of candour and concern.\nHe represented to him the folly and dangerous consequences of the\nprofligate life in which he had plunged himself, counselled him\nwith great warmth to sell off his race-horses, which would otherwise\ninsensibly eat him up; to retrench all superfluous expense, which would\nonly serve to expose him to the ridicule and ingratitude of those who\nwere benefited by it; to lay out his money upon secure mortgages, at\ngood interest; and carry into execution his former design of standing\ncandidate for a borough, at the ensuing election for a new parliament;\nin which case this nobleman promised to assist him with his influence\nand advice; assuring him, that, if he could once procure a seat in the\nhouse, he might look upon his fortune as already made.\n\nOur adventurer perceiving the wisdom and sanity of this advice, for\nwhich he made his acknowledgments to his generous monitor, protested\nthat he would adhere to it in every particular, and immediately set\nabout a reformation. He accordingly took cognizance of his most minute\naffairs, and, after an exact scrutiny, gave his patron to understand,\nthat, exclusive of his furniture, his fortune was reduced to fourteen\nthousand three hundred and thirty pounds, in Bank and South-sea\nannuities, over and above the garrison and its appendages, which he\nreckoned at sixty pounds a year. He therefore desired, that, as his\nlordship had been so kind as to favour him with his friendship and\nadvice, he would extend his generosity still farther, by putting him in\na way of making the most advantage of his money. My lord said, that,\nfor his own part, he did not choose to meddle in money matters; that\nMr. Pickle would find abundance of people ready to borrow it upon land\nsecurity; but that he ought to be extremely cautious in a transaction of\nsuch consequence; promising, at the same time, to employ his own steward\nin seeking out a mortgager to whom it might be safely lent.\n\nThis agent was accordingly set at work, and for a few days made a\nfruitless inquiry; so that the young gentleman was obliged to have\nrecourse to his own intelligence, by which he got notice of several\npeople of reputed credit, who offered him mortgages for the whole sum;\nbut when he made a report of the particulars to his noble friend, his\nlordship started such doubts and objections relating to each, that he\nwas deterred from entering into any engagements with the proposers;\ncongratulating himself, in the meantime, on his good fortune, in being\nfavoured with the advice and direction of such a sage counsellor.\nNevertheless, he began to be impatient, after having unsuccessfully\nconsulted all the money brokers and conveyancers about town, and\nresolved to try the expedient of a public advertisement. But he was\npersuaded by my lord to postpone that experiment, until every other\nmethod should have failed, because it would attract the attention of\nall the pettifoggers in London, who, though they might not be able to\noverreach, would infallibly harass and tease him out of all tranquility.\n\nIt was on the back of this conversation that Peregrine, chancing to meet\nthe steward near his lord's house, stopped him in the street, to give\nhim an account of his bad luck; at which the other expressed some\nconcern, and rubbing his chin with his hand, in a musing posture, told\nPickle, there was a thought just come into his head, pointing out one\nway of doing his business effectually. The youth, upon this intimation,\nbegged he would accompany him to the next coffee-house, in which having\nchosen a private situation, this grave manager gave him to understand,\nthat a part of my lord's estate was mortgaged, in consequence of a debt\ncontracted by his grandfather, for provision to the younger children of\nthe family; and that the equity of redemption would be foreclosed in a\nfew months, unless the burden could be discharged. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009chas always lived in a splendid manner, and, notwithstanding his ample\nfortune, together with the profits accruing from the posts he enjoys,\nhe saves so little money, that, upon this occasion, I know he will\nbe obliged to borrow ten thousand pounds to make up the sum that is\nrequisite to redeem the mortgage. Now, certain I am, that, when his\ndesign comes to be known, he will be solicited on all hands by people\ndesirous of lending money upon such undoubted security; and 'tis\nodds but he has already promised the preference to some particular\nacquaintance. However, as I know he has your interest very much at\nheart, I will, if you please, sound his lordship upon the subject, and\nin a day or two give you notice of my success.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPeregrine, ravished with the prospect of settling this affair so much\nto his satisfaction, thanked the steward for his friendly hint and\nundertaking, which he assured him should be acknowledged by a more solid\nproof of his gratitude, provided the business could be brought to bear;\nand next day he was visited by this kind manager, with the happy news\nof his lordship's having consented to borrow ten thousand pounds of his\nstock upon mortgage, at the interest of five per cent. This information\nhe received as an instance of the singular esteem of his noble patron;\nand the papers being immediately drawn and executed, the money was\ndeposited in the hands of the mortgager, who, in the hearing of the\nlender, laid strong injunctions on his steward to pay the interest\npunctually at quarter-day.\n\nThe best part of our hero's fortune being thus happily deposited, and\nthe agent gratified with a present of fifty pieces, he began to put his\nretrenching scheme in execution; all his servants, Pipes excepted, were\ndischarged, his chariot and running horses disposed of, his housekeeping\nbroken up, and his furniture sold by auction: nay, the heat of his\ndisposition was as remarkable in this as any other transaction in\nhis life; for every step of his saving project was taken with such\neagerness, and even precipitation, that most of his companions thought\nhe was either ruined or mad. But he answered all their expostulations\nwith a string of prudent apophthegms, such as, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe shortest follies\nare the best\u00e2\u0080\u009d; \u00e2\u0080\u009cBetter to retrench upon conviction than compulsion\u00e2\u0080\u009d;\nand divers other wise maxims, seemingly the result of experience and\nphilosophic reflection. To such a degree of enthusiasm did his present\neconomy prevail, that he was actually seized with the desire of\namassing. And as he every day received proposals from those brokers whom\nhe had employed, about the disposal of his cash, he at length ventured\nfifteen hundred pounds upon bottomry, being tempted by the excessive\npremium.\n\nBut it must be observed, for the honour of our adventurer, that this\nreformation did not at all interfere with the good qualities of his\nheart. He was still as friendly and benevolent as ever, though his\nliberality was more subject to the restraint of reason; and he\nmight have justly pleaded, in vindication of his generosity, that he\nretrenched the superfluities in his own way of living, in order to\npreserve the power of assisting his fellow-creatures in distress.\nNumberless were the objects to which he extended his charity in private.\nIndeed, he exerted this virtue in secret, not only on account of\navoiding the charge of ostentation, but also because he was ashamed\nof being detected in such an awkward unfashionable practice, by the\ncensorious observers of this humane generation. In this particular, he\nseemed to confound the ideas of virtue and vice; for he did good, as\nother people do evil, by stealth; and was so capricious in point of\nbehaviour, that frequently, in public, he wagged his tongue in satirical\nanimadversions upon that poverty which his hand had in private\nrelieved. Yet, far from shunning the acquaintance, or discouraging the\nsolicitation of those who, he thought, wanted his assistance, he\nwas always accessible, open, and complaisant to them, even when the\nhaughtiness of his temper kept his superiors at a distance; and often\nsaved a modest man the anguish and confusion of declaring himself, by\npenetrating into his necessity, and anticipating his request, in a\nfrank offer of his purse and friendship. Not that he practised this\nbeneficence to all the needy of his acquaintance without distinction;\nthere is always a set of idle profligate fellows, who, having squandered\naway their own fortunes, and conquered all sense of honour and shame,\nmaintain themselves by borrowing from those who have not yet finished\nthe same career, and want resolution to resist their importunate\ndemands. To these he was always inflexible; though he could not\nabsolutely detach himself from their company, because, by dint of\neffrontery, and such of their original connections as they have been\nable to retain, they find admission to all places of fashionable resort.\n\nSeveral unsuccessful attacks had been made upon his pocket by beggars of\nthis class. One of the most artful of them, having one day joined him\nin the Mall, and made the usual observation on the weather, d--d all\nthe fogs of London, and began a dissertation on the difference of air,\npreferring that of the country in which he was born to any climate under\nthe sun. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWere you ever in Gloucestershire?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he to Peregrine; who\nreplying in the negative, he thus went on: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have got a house there,\nwhere I should be glad to see you. Let us go down together during the\nEaster holidays; I can promise you good country fare and wholesome\nexercise; for I have everything within myself, and as good a pack of\nfox-hounds as any in the three kingdoms. I shan't pretend to expatiate\nupon the elegance of the house, which to be sure is an old building; and\nthese, you know, are generally cold, and not very convenient. But, curse\nthe house! the dirty acres about it are the thing; and d--d fine parcel\nthey are to be sure. If my old grandmother was dead--she can't live\nanother season, for she's turned of fourscore, and quite worn out: nay,\nas for that matter, I believe I have got a letter in my pocket, giving\nan account of her being despaired of by the doctors. Let me see--No, d--\nit! I left it at home, in the pocket of another coat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPickle, who, from the beginning of this harangue, saw its tendency,\nseemed to yield the most serious attention to what he said: breaking in\nupon it, every now and then, with the interjections, hum! ha! the deuce!\nand several civil questions, from which the other conceived happy omens\nof success; till perceiving they had advanced as far as the passage into\nSt. James's, the mischievous youth interrupted him all at once, saying,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see you are for the end of the walk; this is my way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With these\nwords he took leave of the saunterer, who would have delayed his\nretreat, by calling to him aloud, that he had not yet described the\nsituation of his castle. But Peregrine, without stopping, answered\nin the same tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnother time will do as well\u00e2\u0080\u009d; and in a moment\ndisappeared, leaving the projector very much mortified with his\ndisappointment; for his intention was to close the description with a\ndemand of twenty pieces, to be repaid out of the first remittance he\nshould receive from his estate.\n\nIt would have been well for our hero, had he always acted with the same\ncircumspection. But he had his unguarded moments, in which he fell a\nprey to the unsuspecting integrity of his own heart. There was a\nperson among the number of his acquaintances, whose conversation he\nparticularly relished, because it was frank, agreeable, and fraught with\nmany sensible observations upon the craft and treachery of mankind. This\ngentleman had made shift to discuss a very genteel fortune, though\nit was spent with taste and reputation, and now he was reduced to his\nshifts for the maintenance of his family, which consisted of a wife\nand child. Not that he was destitute of the necessaries of life, being\ncomfortably supplied by the bounty of his friends; but this was a\nprovision not at all suited to his inclination; and he had endeavoured,\nby divers unsuccessful schemes, to retrieve his former independency.\n\nPeregrine happened one evening to be sitting alone in a coffee-house,\nwhere he overheard a conversation between this schemer and another\ngentleman, touching an affair that engaged his attention. The stranger\nhad been left trustee for fifteen hundred pounds bequeathed to the\nother's daughter by an aunt, and was strongly solicited to pay the money\nto the child's father, who assured him, he had then an opportunity to\nlay it out in such a manner as would greatly conduce to the advantage of\nhis family. The trustee reminded him of the nature of his charge, which\nmade him accountable for the money until the child should have attained\nthe age of eighteen; but at the same time gave him to understand,\nthat, if he could procure such security as would indemnify him from the\nconsequences, he would forthwith pay the legacy into his hands. To this\nproposal the father replied that it was not to be supposed he would\nrisk the fortune of his only child upon any idle scheme or precarious\nissue; and therefore he thought it reasonable, that he should have the\nuse of it in the meantime; and that, as to security, he was loth to\ntrouble any of his friends about an affair which might be compromised\nwithout their interposition; observing, that he would not look upon his\ncondescension as a favour, if obtained by security, on which he could\nborrow the same sum from any usurer in town.\n\nAfter much importunity on one side, and evasion on the other, the\nmoneyed gentleman told him, that, though he would not surrender the sum\ndeposited in his hands for the use of his daughter, he would lend him\nwhat he should have occasion for in the meantime; and if, upon her being\nof age, he should be able to obtain her concurrence, the money should be\nplaced to her account, provided he could find any person of credit, who\nwould join with him in a bond, for the assurance of the lender. This\nproviso was an obstruction which the other would not have been able to\nsurmount, without great difficulty, had not his cause been espoused by\nour hero, who thought it was a pity a man of honour and understanding\nshould suffer in his principal concerns on such a paltry consideration.\nHe therefore, presuming on his acquaintance, interposed in the\nconversation as a friend, who interested himself in the affair; and,\nbeing fully informed of the particulars, offered himself as a security\nfor the lender. This gentleman being a stranger to Peregrine, was\nnext day made acquainted with his funds; and, without further scruple,\naccommodated his friend with one thousand pounds, for which he took\ntheir bond payable in six months, though he protested that the money\nshould never be demanded, until the infant should be of age, unless some\naccident should happen which he could not then foresee. Pickle\nbelieved this declaration sincere, because he could have no interest in\ndissembling; but what he chiefly depended upon, for his own security,\nwas the integrity and confidence of the borrower, who assured him,\nthat happen what would, he should be able to stand between him and all\ndanger; the nature of his plan being such as would infallibly treble the\nsum in a very few months.\n\nIn a little time after this transaction, writs being issued out for\nelecting a new parliament, our adventurer, by the advice of his patron,\nwent into the country, in order to canvass for a borough, and lined his\npockets with a competent share of banknotes for the occasion. But in\nthis project he unfortunately happened to interfere with the interest of\na great family in the opposition, who, for a long series of years,\nhad made members for that place; and were now so much offended at the\nintrusion of our young gentleman, that they threatened to spend ten\nthousand pounds in frustrating his design. This menace was no other than\nan incitement to Peregrine, who confided so much in his own influence\nand address, that he verily believed he should be able to baffle\nhis grace, even in his own territories. By that victory he hoped to\nestablish his reputation and interest with the minister, who, through\nthe recommendation of his noble friend, countenanced his cause, and\nwould have been very well pleased to see one of his great enemies suffer\nsuch a disgraceful overthrow, which would have, moreover, in a great\nmeasure, shaken his credit with his faction.\n\nOur hero, intoxicated with the ideas of pride and ambition, put all\nhis talents to the test, in the execution of this project. He spared no\nexpense in treating the electors; but, finding himself rivalled in this\nrespect by his competitor, who was powerfully supported, he had recourse\nto those qualifications in which he thought himself superior. He made\nballs for the ladies, visited the matrons of the corporation, adapted\nhimself to their various humours with surprising facility, drank with\nthose who loved a cherishing cup in private, made love to the amorous,\nprayed with the religious, gossiped with those who delighted in scandal,\nand with great sagacity contrived agreeable presents to them all. This\nwas the most effectual method of engaging such electors as were under\nthe influence of their wives. As for the rest, he assailed them in\ntheir own way, setting whole hogsheads of beer and wine abroach, for the\nbenefit of comers; and into those sordid hearts that liquor would not\nopen, he found means to convey himself by the help of a golden key.\n\nWhile he thus exerted himself, his antagonist was not idle: his age and\ninfirmities would not permit him to enter personally into their parties;\nbut his stewards and adherents bestirred themselves with great industry\nand perseverance. The market for votes ran so high, that Pickle's ready\nmoney was exhausted before the day of election, and he was obliged to\nwrite to his patron an account of the dilemma to which he was reduced,\nentreating him to take such speedy measures as would enable him to\nfinish the business which he had so happily begun. This nobleman\ncommunicated the circumstances of the case to the minister, and in a\nday or two our candidate found credit with the receiver-general of the\ncounty, who lent him twelve hundred pounds on his personal note,\npayable on demand. By means of this new supply he managed matters so\nsuccessfully, that an evident majority of votes was secured in his\ninterest, and nothing could have obstructed his election, had not the\nnoble peer who set up his competitor, in order to avoid the shame and\nmortification of being foiled in his own borough, offered to compromise\nthe affair with his honour, by giving up two members in another place,\nprovided the opposition should cease in his own corporation. This\nproposal was greedily embraced. On the eve of the election, Peregrine\nreceived an intimation from his patron, desiring him to quit his\npretensions, on pain of his and the minister's displeasure, and\npromising that he should be elected for another place.\n\nNo other disappointment in life could have given him such chagrin as\nhe felt at the receipt of this tantalizing order, by which the cup of\nsuccess was snatched from his lip, and all the vanity of his ambitious\nhope humbled in the dust. He cursed the whole chain of his court\nconnections, inveighed with great animosity against the rascally scheme\nof politics to which he was sacrificed, and, in conclusion, swore he\nwould not give up the fruits of his own address for the pleasure of any\nminister upon earth. This laudable resolution, however, was rendered\nineffectual by his friend the receiver-general, who was bearer of\nthe message, and, after having in vain endeavoured to persuade him\nto submission, fairly arrested him upon the spot for the money he had\nadvanced; this expedient being performed by virtue of a writ which\nhe had been advised to take out, in case the young man should prove\nrefractory.\n\nThe reader, who by this time must be pretty well acquainted with the\ndisposition of our hero, may easily conceive how he relished this\nadventure. At first, all the faculties of his soul were swallowed up in\nastonishment and indignation; and some minutes elapsed before his nerves\nwould obey the impulse of his rage, which manifested itself in such an\napplication to the temples of the plaintiff, as laid him sprawling on\nthe floor. This assault, which was committed in a tavern, whither he\nhad been purposely decoyed, attracted the regard of the bailiff and his\nfollowers, who, to the number of four, rushed upon him at once, in\norder to overpower him; but his wrath inspired him with such additional\nstrength and agility, that he disengaged himself from them in a trice,\nand, seizing a poker, which was the first weapon that presented itself\nto his hand, exercised it upon their skulls with incredible dexterity\nand execution. The officer himself, who had been the first that presumed\nto lay violent hands upon him, felt the first effects of his fury in a\nblow upon the jaws, in consequence of which he lost three of his teeth,\nand fell athwart the body of the receiver, with which he formed the\nfigure of a St. Andrew's cross. One of his myrmidons, seeing the fate\nof his chief, would not venture to attack the victor in front, but,\nwheeling to one side, made an attempt upon him in flank, and was\nreceived obliquely by our hero's left hand and foot, so masterly\ndisposed to the right side of his leg, and the left side of his neck,\nthat he bolted head foremost into the chimney, where his chin was\nencountered by the grate, which in a moment seared him to the bone. The\nrest of the detachment did not think proper to maintain the dispute,\nbut, evacuating the room with great expedition, locked the door on the\noutside, and bellowed aloud to the receiver's servants, beseeching them\nto come to the assistance of their master, who was in danger of his\nlife.\n\nMeanwhile, this gentleman having recollected himself, demanded a parley;\nwhich having with difficulty obtained of our incensed candidate, in\nconsequence of the most submissive application, he complained grievously\nof the young gentleman's intemperance and heat of disposition, and very\ncalmly represented the danger of his rashness and indiscretion. He told\nhim, that nothing could be more outrageous or idle, than the resistance\nhe had made against the laws of his country, because he would find it\nimpracticable to withstand the whole executive power of the country,\nwhich he could easily raise to apprehend and secure him; that, over and\nabove the disgrace that would accrue to him from this imprudent conduct,\nhe would knock his own interest on the head, by disobliging his friends\nin the administration, who were, to his knowledge, at present very well\ndisposed to do him service; that, for his own part, what he had done\nwas by the express order of his superiors, and not out of any desire of\ndistressing him; and that, far from being his enemy, notwithstanding\nthe shocking insult he had sustained, he was ready to withdraw the writ,\nprovided he would listen to any reasonable terms of accommodation.\n\nPeregrine, who was not more prone to anger than open to conviction,\nbeing appeased by his condescension, moved by his arguments, and chid\nby his own reflection for what he had done in the precipitation of his\nwrath, began to give ear to his remonstrances; and the bailiffs being\nordered to withdraw, they entered into a conference, the result of which\nwas our adventurer's immediate departure for London; so that next day\nhis competitor was unanimously chosen, because nobody appeared to oppose\nhis election. The discontented Pickle, on his arrival in town, went\ndirectly to the house of his patron, to whom, in the anguish of his\ndisappointment, he bitterly complained of the treatment he had received,\nby which, besides the disgrace of his overthrow, he was no less than two\nthousand pounds out of pocket, exclusive of the debt for which he\nstood engaged to the receiver. His lordship, who was prepared for this\nexpostulation, on his knowledge of the young man's impetuous temper,\nanswered all the articles of his charge with great deliberation, giving\nhim to understand the motives that induced the minister to quit his\ninterest in that borough; and soothing him with assurances that his\nloss would be amply rewarded by his honour, to whom he was next day\nintroduced by this nobleman, in the warmest style of recommendation. The\nminister, who was a pattern of complaisance, received him with the\nmost engaging affability; thanked him very kindly for his endeavours\nto support and strengthen the interest of the administration; and\nfaithfully promised to lay hold on the first opportunity to express the\nsense he had of his zeal and attachment; desiring to see him often at\nhis levee, that, in the multiplicity of business, he might not be in\ndanger of forgetting his services and desert.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XC.\n\n\n\nPeregrine commences Minister's Dependant--Meets by Accident with Mrs.\nGauntlet--And descends gradually in the Condition of Life.\n\n\nThis reception, favourable as it was, did not please Peregrine, who had\ntoo much discernment to be cajoled with general promises, at a time\nwhen he thought himself entitled to the most particular assurance. He\naccordingly signified his disgust to his introductor, giving him\nto understand, that he had laid his account with being chosen\nrepresentative of one of those boroughs for which he had been\nsacrificed. His lordship agreed to the reasonableness of his\nexpectation, observing, however, that he could not suppose the minister\nwould enter upon business with him on his first visit; and that it\nwould be time enough at his next audience to communicate his demand.\nNotwithstanding this remonstrance, our hero continued to indulge his\nsuspicion and chagrin, and even made a point of it with his patron, that\nhis lordship should next day make application on his behalf, lest the\ntwo seats should be filled up, on pretence of his inclinations being\nunknown. Thus importuned, my lord went to his principal, and returned\nwith an answer, importing that his honour was extremely sorry that Mr.\nPickle had not signified his request before the boroughs in question\nwere promised to two gentlemen whom he could not now disappoint, with\nany regard to his own credit or interest; but, as several persons who\nwould be chosen were, to his certain knowledge, very aged and infirm, he\ndid not doubt that there would be plenty of vacant seats in a very short\ntime, and then, the young gentleman might depend upon his friendship.\n\nPeregrine was so much irritated at this intimation, that, in the first\ntransports of his anger he forgot the respect he owed his friend, and\nin his presence inveighed against the minister, as a person devoid of\ngratitude and candour, protesting, that if ever an opportunity should\noffer itself, he would spend the whole remains of his fortune in\nopposing his measures. The nobleman having given him time to exhaust\nthe impetuosity of his passion, rebuked him very calmly for his\ndisrespectful expressions, which were equally injurious and indiscreet;\nassured him that this project of revenge, if ever put in execution,\nwould redound to his own prejudice and confusion; and advised him to\ncultivate and improve, with patience and assiduity, the footing he had\nalready obtained in the minister's good graces.\n\nOur hero, convinced of the truth, though not satisfied with the occasion\nof his admonitions, took his leave in a fit of sullen discontent, and\nbegan to ruminate upon the shattered posture of his affairs. All that\nnow remained of the ample fortune he had inherited was the sum he had\ndeposited in his lordship's hands, together with fifteen hundred pounds\nhe had ventured on bottomry, and the garrison, which he had left for the\nuse and accommodation of the lieutenant; and, on the per contra side\nof his account, he was debtor for the supply he had received from the\nreceiver-general, and the money for which he was bound in behalf of his\nfriend; so that he found himself, for the first time of his life, very\nmuch embarrassed in his circumstances. For, of the first half-year's\ninterest of his ten thousand, which was punctually paid, he had but\nfourscore pounds in bank, without any prospect of a farther supply\ntill the other term, which was at the distance of four long months. He\nseriously reflected upon the uncertainty of human affairs: the ship with\nhis fifteen hundred pounds might be lost; the gentleman for whom he was\nsecurity might miscarry in this, as well as in his former projects, and\nthe minister might one day, through policy or displeasure, expose him to\nthe mercy of his dependant, who was in possession of his notes.\n\nThese suggestions did not at all contribute to the ease of our\nadventurer's mind, already ruffled by his disappointment. He cursed\nhis own folly and extravagance, by which he was reduced to such an\nuncomfortable situation. He compared his own conduct with that of some\nyoung gentlemen of his acquaintance, who, while he was squandering\naway the best part of his inheritance, had improved their fortunes,\nstrengthened their interest, and increased their reputation. He was\nabandoned by his gaiety and good-humour, his countenance gradually\ncontracted itself into a representation of severity and care, he dropped\nall his amusements and the companions of his pleasure, and turned his\nwhole attention to the minister, at whose levees he never failed to\nappear.\n\nWhile he thus laboured in the wheel of dependence, with all that\nmortification which a youth of his pride and sensibility may be supposed\nto feel from such a disagreeable necessity, he one day heard himself\ncalled by name, as he crossed the park; and, turning, perceived the wife\nof Captain Gauntlet, with another lady. He no sooner recognized the kind\nSophy, than he accosted her with his wonted civility and friendship;\nbut his former sprightly air was metamorphosed into such austerity, or\nrather dejection of feature, that she could scarce believe her own eyes,\nand, in her astonishment, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it possible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the gay Mr.\nPickle should be so much altered in such a short space of time!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He made\nno other reply to this exclamation, but by a languid smile; and asked\nhow long she had been in town; observing, that he would have paid his\ncompliments to her at her own lodgings, had he been favoured with\nthe least intimation of her arrival. After having thanked him for his\npoliteness, she told him, it was not owing to any abatement of her\nfriendship and esteem for him, that she had omitted to give him that\nnotice; but his abrupt departure from Windsor, and the manner in which\nhe quitted Mr. Gauntlet, had given her just grounds to believe that they\nhad incurred his displeasure; which suspicion was reinforced by his long\nsilence and neglect from that period to the present time. She observed\nit was still farther confirmed, by his forbearing to inquire for Emilia\nand her brother: \u00e2\u0080\u009cjudge, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I had any reason to\nbelieve that you would be pleased to hear that I was in town. However,\nI will not detain you at present, because you seem to be engaged about\nsome particular business; but, if you will favour me with your company\nat breakfast to-morrow, I shall be much pleased, and honoured to boot,\nby the visit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, she gave him a direction to her lodgings;\nand he took his leave, with a faithful promise of seeing her at the\nappointed time.\n\nHe was very much affected with this advance of Sophy, which he\nconsidered as an instance of her uncommon sweetness of temper; he\nfelt strange longings of returning friendship towards Godfrey; and the\nremembrance of Emilia melted his heart, already softened with grief and\nmortification. Next day he did not neglect his engagement, and had the\npleasure of enjoying a long conversation with this sensible young lady,\nwho gave him to understand that her husband was with his regiment; and\npresented to him a fine boy, the first-fruits of their love, whom they\nhad christened by the name of Peregrine, in memory of the friendship\nwhich had subsisted between Godfrey and our youth.\n\nThis proof of their regard, notwithstanding the interruption in their\ncorrespondence, made a deep impression upon the mind of our adventurer,\nwho having made the warmest acknowledgments for this undeserved mark\nof respect, took the child in his arms, and almost devoured him with\nkisses, protesting before God, that he should always consider him with\nthe tenderness of a parent. This was the highest compliment he could pay\nto the gentle Sophy, who again kindly chid him for his disdainful and\nprecipitate retreat, immediately after her marriage; and expressed an\nearnest desire of seeing him and the captain reconciled. He assured her,\nnothing could give him greater satisfaction than such an event, to which\nhe would contribute all that lay in his power, though he could not help\nlooking upon himself as injured by Captain Gauntlet's behaviour,\nwhich denoted a suspicion of his honour, as well as contempt for his\nunderstanding. The lady undertook for the concession of her husband,\nwho, she told him, had been extremely sorry for his own heat, after\nMr. Pickle's departure, and would have followed him to the garrison, in\norder to solicit his forgiveness, had he not been restrained by certain\npunctilios, occasioned by some acrimonious expressions that dropped from\nPeregrine at the inn.\n\nAfter having cleared up this misunderstanding, she proceeded to give an\naccount of Emilia, whose behaviour, at that juncture, plainly indicated\na continuance of affection for her first lover; and desired, that\nhe would give her full powers to bring that matter also to an\naccommodation: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor I am not more certain of my own existence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nshe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthan that you are still in possession of my sister's heart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At\nthis declaration, the tear started in his eye. But he shook his head,\nand declined her good offices, wishing that the young lady might be much\nmore happy than ever he should be able to make her.\n\nMrs. Gauntlet, confounded at these expressions, and moved by the\ndesponding manner in which they were delivered, begged to know if\nany new obstacle was raised, by some late change in his sentiments or\nsituation. And he, in order to avoid a painful explanation, told\nher, that he had long despaired of being able to vanquish Emilia's\nresentment, and for that reason quitted the pursuit, which he would\nnever renew, howsoever his heart might suffer by that resolution; though\nhe took Heaven to witness, that his love, esteem, and admiration of her,\nwere not in the least impaired. But the true motive of his laying aside\nhis design, was the consciousness of his decayed fortune, which, by\nadding to the sensibility of his pride, increased the horror of another\nrepulse. She expressed her concern for this determination, both on his\nown account, and in behalf of Emilia, whose happiness, in her opinion,\ndepended upon his constancy and affection; and she would have questioned\nhim more minutely about the state of his affairs, had not he discouraged\nthe inquiry by seeking to introduce another subject of conversation.\n\nAfter mutual protestations of friendship and regard, he promised to\nvisit her often, during her residence in town; and took his leave in a\nstrange perplexity of mind, occasioned by the images of love, intruding\nupon the remonstrances of carking care. He had some time ago forsaken\nthose extravagant companions with whom he had rioted in the heyday of\nhis fortune, and begun to consort with a graver and more sober species\nof acquaintance. But he now found himself disabled from cultivating\nthe society of these also, who were men of ample estates and liberal\ndispositions; in consequence of which, their parties were too expensive\nfor the consumptive state of his finances; so that he was obliged to\ndescend to another degree, and mingle with a set of old bachelors and\nyounger brothers, who subsisted on slender annuities, or what is called\na bare competency in the public funds. This association was composed of\nsecond-hand politicians and minor critics, who in the forenoon saunter\nin the Mall, or lounge at shows of pictures, appear in the drawing-room\nonce or twice a week, dine at an ordinary, decide disputes in a\ncoffee-house, with an air of superior intelligence, frequent the pit\nof the playhouse, and once in a month spend an evening with some noted\nactor, whose remarkable sayings they repeat for the entertainment of\ntheir ordinary friends.\n\nAfter all, he found something comfortable enough in the company of\nthese gentlemen, who never interested his passions to any violence of\ntransport, nor teased him with impertinent curiosity about his private\naffairs. For, though many of them had maintained a very long, close, and\nfriendly correspondence with each other, they never dreamt of inquiring\ninto particular concerns; and if one of the two who were most intimately\nconnected, had been asked how the other made a shift to live, he would\nhave answered with great truth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cReally, that is more than I know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Notwithstanding this phlegmatic indifference, which is of the true\nEnglish production, they were all inoffensive, good-natured people, who\nloved a joke and a song, delighted in telling a merry story, and prided\nthemselves in the art of catering, especially in the articles of fish,\nvenison, and wild fowl.\n\nOur young gentleman was not received among them on the footing of a\ncommon member, who makes interest for his admission; he was courted as a\nperson of superior genius and importance, and his compliance looked upon\nas an honour to their society. This their idea of his pre-eminence was\nsupported by his conversation, which, while it was more liberal and\nlearned than that to which they had been accustomed, was tinctured\nwith an assuming air, so agreeably diffused, that, instead of producing\naversion, it commanded respect. They not only appealed to him, in all\ndoubts relating to foreign parts, to which one and all of them were\nstrangers, but also consulted his knowledge in history and divinity,\nwhich were frequently the topics of their debates; and, in poetry of\nall kinds, he decided with such magisterial authority, as even\nweighed against the opinions of the players themselves. The variety of\ncharacters he had seen and observed, and the high spheres of life in\nwhich he had so lately moved, furnished him with a thousand entertaining\nanecdotes. When he became a little familiarized to his disappointments,\nso that his natural vivacity began to revive, he flashed among them in\nsuch a number of bright sallies, as struck them with admiration, and\nconstituted himself a classic in wit; insomuch that they began to retail\nhis remnants, and even invited some particular friends to come and hear\nhim hold forth. One of the players, who had for many years strutted\nabout the taverns in the neighbourhood of Covent Garden as the Grand\nTurk of wit and humour, began to find his admirers melt away; and a\ncertain petulant physician, who had shone at almost all the port clubs\nin that end of the town, was actually obliged to import his talents into\nthe city, where he was now happily taken root.\n\nNor was this success to be wondered at, if we consider that, over and\nabove his natural genius and education, our adventurer still had the\nopportunity of knowing everything which happened among the great, by\nmeans of his friend Cadwallader, with whom he still maintained his\nformer intimacy, though it was now chequered with many occasional tiffs,\nowing to the sarcastic remonstrances of the misanthrope, who disapproved\nof those schemes which miscarried with Peregrine, and now took\nunseasonable methods of valuing himself upon his own foresight. Nay, he\nwas between whiles like a raven, croaking presages of more ill-luck from\nthe deceit of the minister, the dissimulation of his patron, the folly\nof the projector, for whom he was bound, the uncertainty of the seas,\nand the villainy of those with whom he had entrusted his cash, for\nCrabtree saw and considered everything through a perspective of spleen,\nthat always reflected the worst side of human nature. For these reasons\nour young gentleman began to be disgusted, at certain intervals, with\nthe character of this old man, whom he now thought a morose cynic, not\nso much incensed against the follies and vices of mankind, as delighted\nwith the distress of his fellow-creatures. Thus he put the most\nunfavourable construction on the principles of his friend, because he\nfound himself justly fallen under the lash of his animadversion. Thus\nself-accusation very often dissolves the closest friendship. A man,\nconscious of his own indiscretion, is implacably offended at the\nrectitude of his companion's conduct, which he considers as an insult\nupon his failings, never to be forgiven, even though he has not tasted\nthe bitterness of reproof, which no sinner can commodiously digest. The\nfriendship, therefore, subsisting between Crabtree and Pickle, had of\nlate suffered several symptomatic shocks, that seemed to prognosticate\na total dissolution; a great deal of smart dialogue had passed in their\nprivate conversations, and the senior began to repent of having placed\nhis confidence in such an imprudent, headstrong ungovernable youth.\n\nIt was in such paroxysms of displeasure that he prophesied misfortune\nto Peregrine, and even told him one morning, that he had dreamed of the\nshipwreck of the two East Indiamen, on board of which he had hazarded\nhis money. But this was no other than a false vision; for in a few\nweeks, one of them arrived at her moorings in the river, and he received\na thousand in lieu of eight hundred pounds which he had lent upon bond\nto one of the mates. At the same time he was informed, that the other\nship, in which he was concerned, had, in all probability, lost her\npassage for the season, by being unable to weather the Cape. He was\nnot at all concerned at that piece of news, knowing, that the longer he\nshould be out of his money, he would have the more interest to receive;\nand, finding his present difficulties removed by this supply, his heart\nbegan to dilate, and his countenance to resume its former alacrity. This\nstate of exultation, however, was soon interrupted by a small accident,\nwhich he could not foresee. He was visited one morning by the person\nwho had lent his friend a thousand pounds on his security, and given\nto understand, that the borrower had absconded, in consequence of a\ndisappointment, by which he had lost the whole sum and all hopes of\nretrieving it; so that our hero was now liable for the debt, which he\nbesought him to discharge according to the bond, that he, the lender,\nmight not suffer by his humanity. It may be easily conceived that\nPeregrine did not receive this intelligence in cold blood. He cursed his\nown imprudence in contracting such engagements with an adventurer, whom\nhe did not sufficiently know. He exclaimed against the treachery of the\nprojector; and having for some time indulged his resentment in threats\nand imprecations, inquired into the nature of the scheme which had\nmiscarried.\n\nThe lender, who had informed himself of the whole affair, gratified his\ncuriosity in this particular, by telling him that the fugitive had been\ncajoled by a certain knight of the post, who undertook to manage the\nthousand pounds in such a manner as would, in a very little time, make\nhim perfectly independent; and thus he delineated the plan: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne half\nof the sum,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshall be laid out in jewels, which I will pawn to\ncertain persons of credit and fortune, who lend money upon such pledges\nat an exorbitant interest. The other shall be kept for relieving\nthem, so that they may be again deposited with a second set of those\nhonourable usurers; and when they shall have been circulated in this\nmanner through a variety of hands, we will extort money from each of the\npawnbrokers, by threatening them with a public prosecution, for exacting\nillegal interest; and I know that they will bleed freely, rather than\nbe exposed to the infamy attending such an accusation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The scheme was\nfeasible, and though not very honourable, made such an impression upon\nthe needy borrower, that he assented to the proposals; and, by our\nhero's credit, the money was raised. The jewels were accordingly\npurchased, pawned, relieved, and repledged by the agent, who undertook\nto manage the whole affair; and so judiciously was the project executed,\nthat he could have easily proved each lender guilty of the charge.\nHaving thus far successfully transacted the business, this faithful\nagent visited them severally on his own account, to give them\nintimation, that his employer intended to sue them on the statute of\nusury; upon which, every one for himself bribed the informer to withdraw\nhis evidence, by which alone he could be convicted; and having received\nthese gratifications, he had thought proper to retreat into France\nwith the whole booty, including the original thousand that put them in\nmotion. In consequence of this decampment, the borrower had withdrawn\nhimself; so that the lender was obliged to have recourse to his\nsecurity.\n\nThis was a very mortifying account to our young gentleman, who, in\nvain, reminded the narrator of his promise, importing, that he would not\ndemand the money, until he should be called to an account by his ward;\nand observed, that, long before that period, the fugitive might appear\nand discharge the debt. But the other was deaf to these remonstrances;\nalleging, that his promise was provisional, on the supposition that the\nborrower would deal candidly and fairly; that he had forfeited all title\nto his friendship and trust, by the scandalous scheme in which he had\nembarked; and that his treacherous flight from his security was no proof\nof his honesty and intended return; but, on the contrary, a warning, by\nwhich he, the lender, was taught to take care of himself. He therefore\ninsisted upon his being indemnified immediately, on pain of letting the\nlaw take its course; and Peregrine was actually obliged to part with\nthe whole sum he had so lately received. But this payment was not made\nwithout extreme reluctance, indignation, and denunciation of eternal war\nagainst the absconder, and the rigid creditor, betwixt whom he suspected\nsome collusion.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCI.\n\n\n\nCadwallader acts the part of a Comforter to his Friend; and in his turn\nis consoled by Peregrine, who begins to find himself a most egregious\nDupe.\n\n\nThis new misfortune, which he justly charged to the account of his own\nfolly, recalled his chagrin; and though he endeavoured with all his\nmight to conceal the affair from the knowledge of Cadwallader, that\nprying observer perceived his countenance overcast. The projector's\nsudden disappearance alarming his suspicion, he managed his inquiries\nwith so much art, that in a few days he made himself acquainted with\nevery particular of the transaction, and resolved to gratify his\nspleen at the expense of the impatient dupe. With this view, he took an\nopportunity to accost him with a very serious air, saying a friend of\nhis had immediate occasion for a thousand pounds, and as Peregrine had\nthe exact sum lying by him, he would take it as a great favour if he\nwould part with it for a few months on undoubted security. Had Pickle\nknown the true motive of this demand, he would in all likelihood have\nmade a very disagreeable answer; but Crabtree had wrappped himself up so\nsecurely in the dissimulation of his features, that the youth could not\npossibly penetrate into his intention; and in the most galling suspense\nreplied, that the money was otherwise engaged. The misanthrope, not\ncontented with this irritation, assumed the prerogative of a friend, and\nquestioned him so minutely about the disposal of the cash, that, after\nnumberless evasions, which cost him a world of torture to invent, he\ncould contain his vexation no longer, but exclaimed in a rage, \u00e2\u0080\u009cD-- your\nimpertinence! 'tis gone to the devil, and that's enough!\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThereafter,\nas it may be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said this tormentor, with a most provoking indifference\nof aspect, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should be glad to know upon what footing; for I suppose\nyou have some expectation of advantage from that quarter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009c'Sdeath!\nsir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the impatient youth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I had any expectation from hell, I\nwould make interest with you; for I believe, from my soul, you are one\nof its most favoured ministers upon earth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With these words, he flung\nout of the room, leaving Cadwallader very well satisfied with the\nchastisement he had bestowed.\n\nPeregrine having cooled himself with a solitary walk in the park,\nduring which the violence of his choler gradually evaporated, and his\nreflection was called to a serious deliberation upon the posture of his\naffairs, he resolved to redouble his diligence and importunity with his\npatron and the minister, in order to obtain some sinecure, which would\nindemnify him for the damage he had sustained on their account. He\naccordingly went to his lordship and signified his demand, after having\ntold him, that he had suffered several fresh losses, which rendered\nan immediate provision of that sort necessary to his credit and\nsubsistence. His noble friend commended him for the regard he manifested\nfor his own interest, which he considered as a proof of his being at\nlast detached from the careless inadvertency of youth; he approved of\nhis demand, which he assured him should be faithfully transmitted to the\nminister, and backed with all his influence; and encouraged his hope, by\nobserving, that some profitable places were at that time vacant, and, so\nfar as he knew, unengaged.\n\nThis conversation helped to restore the tranquility of Pickle's breast,\nthough he still harboured resentment against Cadwallader, on account of\nthe last insult; and on the instant he formed a plan of revenge. He knew\nthe misanthrope's remittances from his estate in the country had been of\nlate very scanty, in consequence of repairs and bankruptcies among his\ntenants; so that, in spite of all his frugality, he had been but barely\nable to maintain his credit, and even that was engaged on the strength\nof his running rent. Being therefore intimately acquainted with the\nparticulars of his fortune, he wrote a letter to Crabtree, subscribed\nwith the name of his principal farmer's wife, importing that her husband\nbeing lately dead, and the greatest part of her cattle destroyed by the\ninfectious distemper, she found herself utterly incapable of paying the\nrent which was due, or even of keeping the farm, unless he would, out\nof his great goodness, be pleased to give her some assistance, and allow\nher to sit free for a twelvemonth to come. This intimation he found\nmeans to convey by post from a market town adjoining to the farm,\ndirected in the usual style to the cynic, who, seeing it stamped with\nthe known marks, could not possibly suspect any imposition.\n\nHackneyed as he was in the ways of life, and steeled with his boasted\nstoicism, this epistle threw him into such an agony of vexation, that\na double proportion of souring was visible in his aspect, when he was\nvisited by the author, who, having observed and followed the postman\nat a proper distance, introduced a conversation upon his own\ndisappointments, in which, among other circumstances of his own\nill-luck, he told him, that his patron's steward had desired to be\nexcused from paying the last quarter of his interest precisely at the\nappointed term, for which reason he should be utterly void of cash, and\ntherefore requested that Crabtree would accommodate him with an hundred\npieces of his next remittance from the country.\n\nThis demand galled and perplexed the old man to such a degree, that\nthe muscles of his face assumed a contraction peculiarly virulent, and\nexhibited the character of Diogenes with a most lively expression; he\nknew that a confession of his true situation would furnish Pickle with\nan opportunity to make reprisals upon him, with intolerable triumph;\nand that, by a downright refusal to supply his wants, he would for ever\nforfeit his friendship and esteem, and might provoke him to take ample\nvengeance for his sordid behaviour, by exposing him, in his native\ncolours, to the resentment of those whom he had so long deceived. These\nconsiderations kept him some time in a most rancorous state of suspense,\nwhich Peregrine affected to misinterpret, by bidding him freely declare\nhis suspicion, if he did not think it safe to comply with his request,\nand he would make shift elsewhere.\n\nThis seeming misconstruction increased the torture of the misanthrope,\nwho, with the utmost irritation of feature, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOons!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat\nvillainy have you noted in my conduct, that you treat me like a rascally\nusurer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Peregrine very gravely replied, that the question needed no\nanswer; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009chad I considered you as a usurer, I would have\ncome with a security under my arm; but, all evasion apart, will you\nstead me? will you pleasure me? shall I have the money?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWould it were\nin your belly, with a barrel of gunpowder!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the enraged cynic;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009csince I must be excruciated, read that plaguy paper! 'Sblood! why\ndidn't nature clap a pair of long ears and a tail upon me, that I might\nbe a real ass, and champ thistles on some common, independent of my\nfellow-creatures? Would I were a worm, that I might creep into the\nearth, and thatch my habitation with a single straw; or rather a wasp\nor a viper, that I might make the rascally world feel my resentment. But\nwhy do I talk of rascality? folly, folly, is the scourge of life! Give\nme a scoundrel, so he be a sensible one, and I will put him in my heart\nof hearts! but a fool is more mischievous than famine, pestilence, and\nwar. The idiotical hag that writes, or causes to be writ, this same\nletter, has ruined her family, and broke her husband's heart, by\nignorance and mismanagement; and she imputes her calamity to Providence\nwith a vengeance; and so I am defrauded of three hundred pounds, the\ngreatest part of which I owe to tradesmen, whom I have promised to pay\nthis very quarter. Pox upon her! I would she were a horned beast, that\nthe distemper might lay hold on her. The beldame has the impudence too,\nafter she has brought me into this dilemma, to solicit my assistance\nto stock the farm anew! Before God, I have a good mind to send her a\nhalter, and perhaps I might purchase another for myself, but that I\nwould not furnish food for laughter to knaves and coxcombs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPeregrine having perused the billet, and listened to this ejaculation,\nreplied with great composure, that he was ashamed to see a man of\nhis years and pretensions to philosophy so ruffled by a trifle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\nsignify all the boasted hardships you have overcome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand the\nshrewd observations you pretend to have made on human nature? Where is\nthat stoical indifference you affirm you have attained, if such a paltry\ndisappointment can disturb you in this manner? What is the loss of\nthree hundred pounds, compared with the misfortunes which I myself have\nundergone within these two years? Yet you will take upon you to act the\ncensor, and inveigh against the impatience and impetuosity of youth, as\nif you yourself had gained an absolute conquest over all the passions\nof the heart. You were so kind as to insult me another day in my\naffliction, by reproaching me with indiscretion and misconduct: suppose\nI were now to retort the imputation, and ask how a man of your profound\nsagacity could leave your fortune at the discretion of ignorant\npeasants? How could you be so blind as not to foresee the necessity of\nrepairs, together with the danger of bankruptcy, murrain, or thin crop?\nWhy did you not convert your land into ready money, and, as you have no\nconnections in life, purchase an annuity, on which you might have lived\nat your ease, without any fear of the consequence? Can't you, from the\nwhole budget of your philosophy, cull one apophthegm to console you for\nthis trivial mischance?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRot your rapidity!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the cynic, half-choked with gall; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif the\ncancer or the pox were in your throat, I should not be thus tormented\nwith your tongue; and yet a magpie shall speak infinitely more to the\npurpose. Don't you know, Mr. Wiseacre, that my case does not fall within\nthe province of philosophy? Had I been curtailed of all my members,\nracked by the gout and gravel, deprived of liberty, robbed of an only\nchild, or visited with the death of a dear friend like you, philosophy\nmight have contributed to my consolation; but will philosophy pay my\ndebts, or free me from the burden of obligation to a set of fellows whom\nI despise?--speak-pronounce-demonstrate, or may Heaven close your mouth\nfor ever!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese are the comfortable fruits of your misanthropy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the\nyouth; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour laudable scheme of detaching yourself from the bonds of\nsociety, and of moving in a superior sphere of your own. Had you not\nbeen so peculiarly sage, and intent upon laughing at mankind, you could\nnever have been disconcerted by such a pitiful inconvenience; any friend\nwould have accommodated you with the sum in question. But now the world\nmay retort the laugh; for you stand upon such an agreeable footing with\nyour acquaintance, that nothing could please them better than an account\nof your having given disappointment the slip, by the help of a noose\nproperly applied. This I mention by way of hint, upon which I would have\nyou chew the cud of reflection; and, should it come to that issue, I\nwill use my whole interest with the coroner to bring in his verdict\nlunacy, that your carcase may have Christian burial.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he withdrew, very well satisfied with the revenge he had\ntaken, which operated so violently upon Crabtree, that, if it had\nnot been for the sole consideration mentioned above, he would, in\nall probability, have had recourse to the remedy proposed. But his\nunwillingness to oblige and entertain his fellow-creatures hindered him\nfrom practising that expedient, till, by course of post, he was happily\nundeceived with regard to the situation of his affairs; and that\ninformation had such an effect upon him, that he not only forgave our\nhero for the stratagem, which he immediately ascribed to the right\nauthor, but also made him a tender of his purse; so that matters for the\npresent were brought to an amicable accommodation.\n\nMeanwhile Peregrine never slacked in his attendance upon the great; he\nnever omitted to appear upon every levee day, employed his industry and\npenetration in getting intelligence of posts that were unfilled, and\nevery day recommended himself to the good offices of his patron, who\nseemed to espouse his interest with great cordiality; nevertheless, he\nwas always too late in his application, or the place he demanded chanced\nto be out of the minister's gift. These intimations, though communicated\nin the most warm professions of friendship and regard, gave great\numbrage to the young gentleman, who considered them as the evasions\nof an insincere courtier, and loudly complained of them as such to\nhis lordship, signifying, at the same time, an intention to sell his\nmortgage for ready money, which he would expend to the last farthing in\nthwarting his honour, in the very first election he should patronize.\nHis lordship never wanted a proper exhortation upon these occasions. He\ndid not now endeavour to pacify him with assurances of the minister's\nfavour, because he perceived that these medicines had, by repeated use,\nlost their effect upon our adventurer, whose menaces he now combated\nby representing that the minister's purse was heavier than that of\nMr. Pickle; that, therefore, should he make a point of opposing his\ninterest, the youth must infallibly fail in the contest; in which case\nhe would find himself utterly destitute of the means of subsistence, and\nconsequently precluded from all hope of provision.\n\nThis was an observation, the truth of which our young gentleman could\nnot pretend to doubt, though it did not at all tend to the vindication\nof his honour's conduct. Indeed, Pickle began to suspect the sincerity\nof his own patron, who, in his opinion, had trifled with his impatience,\nand even eluded, by sorry excuses, his desire of having another\nprivate audience of the first mover. His lordship also began to be less\naccessible than usual; and Peregrine had been obliged to dun the steward\nwith repeated demands, before he could finger the last quarter of his\ninterest. Alarmed by these considerations, he went and consulted the\nnobleman whom he had obliged in the affair of his son, and had the\nmortification to hear but a very indifferent character of the person in\nwhom he had so long confided. This new adviser, who, though a courtier,\nwas a rival of the other, gave our adventurer to understand, that he had\nbeen leaning upon a broken reed; that his professed patron was a man of\nshattered fortune and decayed interest, which extended no farther than\na smile and a whisper; that, for his own part, he should have been proud\nof an opportunity to use his influence with the minister in behalf of\nMr. Pickle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, since you have put yourself under the protection of\nanother peer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhose connections interfere with mine, I cannot\nnow espouse your cause, without incurring the imputation of seducing\nthat nobleman's adherents; a charge which, of all others, I would most\ncarefully avoid. However, I shall always be ready to assist you with my\nprivate advice, as a specimen of which, I now counsel you to insist upon\nhaving another interview with Sir Steady Steerwell himself, that you\nmay in person explain your pretensions, without any risk of being\nmisrepresented; and endeavour, if possible, to draw him into some\nparticular promise, from which he cannot retract, with any regard to\nhis reputation; for general profession is a necessary armour worn by all\nministers in their own defence, against the importunity of those whom\nthey will not befriend, and would not disoblige.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis advice was so conformable to his own sentiments, that our\nadventurer seized the first opportunity to demand a hearing, and plainly\ntold his patron, that, if he could not be indulged with that favour, he\nshould look upon his lordship's influence to be very small, and his\nown hopes to be altogether desperate; in which case he was resolved to\ndispose of the mortgage, purchase an annuity, and live independent.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCII.\n\n\n\nHe is indulged with a second Audience by the Minister, of whose\nSincerity he is convinced--His Pride and Ambition revive, and again are\nmortified.\n\n\nIf the young gentleman's money had been in other hands, perhaps the peer\nwould have been at very little pains, either in gratifying his demand,\nor opposing his revenge; but he knew that the sale of the mortgage\ncould not be effected without an inquiry, to which he did not wish to\nbe exposed. He, therefore, employed all his interest in procuring the\nsolicited audience. This being granted, Peregrine, with great warmth and\nelocution, expatiated upon the injury his fortune had suffered in the\naffair of the borough, for which he had stood candidate; he took notice\nof the disappointment he had sustained in the other election, reminded\nhim of the promises with which he had been amused, and, in conclusion,\ndesired to know what he had to expect from his favour. The minister\nhaving patiently heard him to an end, replied with a most gracious\naspect, that he was very well informed of his merit and attachment, and\nvery much disposed to convince him of the regard which he paid to\nboth; that till of late he did not know the nature of his expectations,\nneither had he the power of creating posts for those whom he was\ninclined to serve; but if Mr. Pickle would chalk out any feasible method\nby which he could manifest his sentiments of friendship, he should not\nbe backward in executing the plan.\n\nPeregrine, laying hold on this declaration, mentioned several places\nwhich he knew to be vacant. But the old evasion was still used; one of\nthem was not in his department of business, another had been promised to\nthe third son of a certain earl before the death of the last possessor,\nand a third was encumbered with a pension that ate up a good half of\nthe appointments. In short, such obstructions were started to all his\nproposals as he could not possibly surmount, though he plainly perceived\nthey were no other than specious pretexts to cover the mortifying side\nof a refusal. Exasperated, therefore, at this lack of sincerity and\ngratitude, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can easily foresee,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat such difficulties will\nnever be wanting, when I have anything to ask; and for that reason\nwill save myself the trouble of any further application.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he\nwithdrew in a very abrupt manner, breathing defiance and revenge. But\nhis patron, who did not think proper to drive him to extremities, found\nmeans to persuade his honour to do something for the pacification of\nthe young man's choler; and that same evening our adventurer received a\nmessage from his lordship, desiring to see him immediately.\n\nIn consequence of this intimation, Pickle went to his house, and\nappeared before him with a very cloudy aspect, which signified to whom\nit might concern, that his temper was at present too much galled to\nendure reproof; and therefore the sagacious peer forbore taking him to\ntask for his behaviour during the audience he had obtained; but gave him\nto understand, that the minister, in consideration of his services, had\nsent him a bank-note of three hundred pounds, with a promise of the like\nsum yearly, until he could be otherwise provided for. This declaration\nin some measure appeased the youth, who condescended to accept the\npresent; and, next levee day, made his acknowledgment to the donor,\nwho favoured him with a smile of infinite complacency, which entirely\ndissipated all the remains of his resentment; for, as he could not\npossibly divine the true cause of his being temporized with, he looked\nupon this condescension as an undoubted proof of Sir Steady's sincerity,\nand firmly believed that he would settle him in some place with the\nfirst opportunity, rather than continue to pay this pension out of his\nown pocket. In all probability, his prediction would have been verified,\nhad not an unforeseen accident in a moment overwhelmed the barque of his\ninterest at court.\n\nMeanwhile, this short gleam of good fortune recalled the ideas of pride\nand ambition which he had formerly cherished. His countenance was again\nlifted up, his good-humour retrieved, and his mien reexalted. Indeed, he\nbegan to be considered as a rising man by his fellow-dependents, who saw\nthe particular notice with which he was favoured at the public levee;\nand some of them, for that reason, were at pains to court his good\ngraces. He no longer shunned his former intimates, with whom a good\npart of his fortune had been spent, but made up to them in all places of\npublic resort, with the same ease and familiarity as he had been used\nto express, and even re-embarked in some of their excesses, upon the\nstrength of his sanguine expectation. Cadwallader and he renewed\ntheir consultations in the court of ridicule; and divers exploits were\nachieved, to the confusion of those who had \u00e2\u0080\u009csailed into the north of\ntheir displeasure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut these enjoyments were soon interrupted by a misfortune equally fatal\nand unexpected. His noble patron was seized with an apoplectic fit, from\nwhich he was recovered by the physicians, that they might despatch him\naccording to rule, and in two months after they were called, he went the\nway of all flesh. Peregrine was very much afflicted at this event, not\nonly on account of his friendship for the deceased, to whom he thought\nhimself under many and great obligations, but also because he feared\nthat his own interest would suffer a severe shock, by the removal of\nthis nobleman, whom he considered as its chief support. He put himself\ntherefore in mourning, out of regard to the memory of his departed\nfriend, and exhibited genuine marks of sorrow and concern, though he\nhad in reality more cause to grieve than he as yet imagined. When\nquarter-day came about, he applied to the steward of his lordship's heir\nfor the interest of his money, as usual; and the reader will readily\nown he had some reason to be surprised, when he was told he had no claim\neither to principal or interest. True it is, the manager talked very\ncivilly as well as sensibly on the subject. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour appearance, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nhe to Pickle, \u00e2\u0080\u009cscreens you from all suspicion of an intended fraud; but\nthe mortgage upon those lands you mention was granted to another person\nmany years before you pretend to have lent that sum; and I have, this\nvery morning, paid one quarter's interest, as appears from this receipt,\nwhich you may peruse for your satisfaction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPeregrine was so thunderstruck at this information, which stripped him\nof his all, that he could not utter one word; a circumstance that did\nno great honour to his character in the opinion of the steward, who,\nin good earnest, began to entertain some doubts of his integrity. For,\namong the papers of the deceased, which he had examined, there was no\nwriting, memorandum, or receipt relating to this encumbrance. After a\nlong pause of stupefaction, Peregrine recollected himself so far as to\nobserve, that either he was egregiously mistaken, or the predecessor of\nhis lord the greatest villain upon earth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, Mr. Whatd'ycallum,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nhe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must give me leave to tell you, that your bare assertion in\nthis affair will by no means induce me to put up quietly with the loss\nof ten thousand pounds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaving thus expressed himself, he retired from the house so discontented\nat this demur, that he scarce knew whether he moved upon his head or\nheels; and the park chancing to be in his way, he sauntered about,\ngiving vent to a soliloquy in praise of his departed friend, the burden\nof which was a string of incoherent curses imprecated upon himself; till\nhis transports by degrees giving way to his reflection, he deliberated\nseriously and sorrowfully upon his misfortune, and resolved to consult\nlawyers without loss of time. But, first of all, he proposed to make\npersonal application to the heir, who, by a candid representation of\nthe case, might be inclined to do him justice. In consequence of this\ndetermination, he next morning put his writings in his pocket, and went\nin a chair to the house of the young nobleman, to whom, being admitted\nby virtue of his appearance, and a small gratification to the porter, he\nexplained the whole affair, corroborating his assertions with the papers\nwhich he produced, and describing the disgrace that would be entailed\nupon the memory of the deceased, should he be obliged to seek redress in\na public court of justice.\n\nThe executor, who was a person of good breeding, condoled him upon his\nloss with great good-nature, though he did not seem much surprised at\nhis account of the matter; but wished, that, since the fraud must have\nbeen committed, the damage had fallen upon the first mortgager, who,\nhe said, was a thievish usurer, grown rich by the distresses of his\nfellow-creatures. In answer to our hero's remonstrances, he observed,\nthat he did not look upon himself as obliged to pay the least regard to\nthe character of his predecessor, who had used him with great barbarity\nand injustice, not only in excluding him from his countenance and\nassistance, but also in prejudicing his inheritance as much as lay in\nhis power; so that it could not be reasonably expected that he would\npay ten thousand pounds of his debt, for which he had received no\nvalue. Peregrine, in spite of his chagrin, could not help owning within\nhimself, that there was a good deal of reason in this refusal. After\nhaving given loose to his indignation in the most violent invectives\nagainst the defunct, he took his leave of the complaisant heir, and had\nimmediate recourse to the advice of counsel, who assured him that he had\nan excellent plea, and was accordingly retained in the cause.\n\nAll these measures were taken in the first vigour of his exertion,\nduring which his spirits were so fluttered with the diversity of\npassions produced by his mischance, that he mistook for equanimity that\nwhich was no other than intoxication; and two whole days elapsed before\nhe attained a due sense of his misfortune. Then, indeed, he underwent a\nwoeful self-examination; every circumstance of the inquiry added fresh\npangs to his reflection; and the result of the whole was a discovery,\nthat his fortune was totally consumed, and himself reduced to a state\nof the most deplorable dependence. This suggestion alone might, in the\nanguish of his despondency, have driven him to some desperate course,\nhad it not been in some measure qualified by the confidence of his\nlawyers, and the assurance of the minister, which, slender as the world\nhath generally found them, were the only bulwarks between misery and\nhim.\n\nThe mind is naturally pliable, and, provided it has the least hope to\nlean upon, adapts itself wonderfully to the emergencies of fortune,\nespecially when the imagination is gay and luxuriant. This was the case\nwith our adventurer; instead of indulging the melancholy ideas which\nhis loss inspired, he had recourse to the flattering delusions of hope,\nsoothing himself with unsubstantial plans of future greatness, and\nendeavouring to cover what was past with the veil of oblivion. After\nsome hesitation, he resolved to make Crabtree acquainted with his\nmisfortune, that once for all he might pass the ordeal of his satire,\nwithout subjecting himself to a long series of sarcastic hints and\ndoubtful allusions, which he could not endure. He accordingly took the\nfirst opportunity of telling him that he was absolutely ruined by the\nperfidy of his patron, and desired that he would not aggravate his\naffliction by those cynical remarks which were peculiar to men of his\nmisanthropical disposition. Cadwallader listened to this declaration\nwith internal surprise, which, however, produced no alteration in his\ncountenance; and, after some pause, observed, that our hero had no\nreason to look for any new observation from him upon this event, which\nhe had long foreseen, and daily expected, and exhorted him, with an\nironical sneer, to console himself with the promise of the minister, who\nwould doubtless discharge the debts of his deceased bosom friend.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCIII.\n\n\n\nPeregrine commits himself to the Public, and is admitted Member of a\nCollege of Authors.\n\n\nThe bitterness of this explanation being passed, our young gentleman\nbegan to revolve within himself schemes for making up the deficiencies\nof his yearly income, which was now so grievously reduced; and\ndetermined to profit, in some shape or other, by those talents which he\nowed to nature and education. He had, in his affluence, heard of several\nauthors, who, without any pretensions to genius or human literature,\nearned a very genteel subsistence by undertaking work for booksellers,\nin which reputation was not at all concerned. One, for example,\nprofessed all manner of translation, at so much per sheet, and actually\nkept five or six amanuenses continually employed, like so many clerks in\na counting-house, by which means he was enabled to live at his ease, and\nenjoy his friend and his bottle, ambitious of no other character than\nthat of an honest man and a good neighbour. Another projected a variety\nof plans for new dictionaries, which were executed under his eye by\nday-labourers; and the province of a third was history and voyages,\ncollected or abridged by understrappers of the same class.\n\nMr. Pickle, in his comparisons, paid such deference to his own\ncapacity, as banished all doubts of his being able to excel any of those\nundertakers in their different branches of profession, if ever he should\nbe driven to that experiment; but his ambition prompted him to make his\ninterest and glory coincide, by attempting some performance which\nshould do him honour with the public, and at the same time establish\nhis importance among the copy-purchasers in town. With this view, he\nworshipped the muse; and, conscious of the little regard which is in\nthis age paid to every species of poetic composition, in which neither\nsatire nor obscenity occurs, he produced an imitation of Juvenal,\nand lashed some conspicuous characters, with equal truth, spirit, and\nseverity. Though his name did not appear in the title-page of this\nproduction, he managed matters so that the work was universally\nimputed to the true author, who was not altogether disappointed in his\nexpectations of success; for the impression was immediately sold off,\nand the piece became the subject of conversation in all assemblies of\ntaste.\n\nThis happy exordium not only attracted the addresses of the booksellers,\nwho made interest for his acquaintance, but also roused the notice of a\nsociety of authors, who styled themselves \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe College,\u00e2\u0080\u009d from which\nhe was honoured with a deputation, offering to enroll him a member by\nunanimous consent. The person employed for this purpose being a bard\nwho had formerly tasted of our hero's bounty, used all his eloquence to\npersuade him to comply with the advances of their fraternity, which\nhe described in such a manner as inflamed the curiosity of Pickle, who\ndismissed the ambassador, with an acknowledgment of the great honour\nthey conferred upon him, and a faithful promise of endeavouring to merit\nthe continuance of their approbation.\n\nHe was afterwards, by the same minister, instructed in the ceremonies of\nthe college; and, in consequence of his information, composed an ode,\nto be publicly recited on the evening of his introduction. He understood\nthat this constitution was no other than a body of authors, incorporated\nby mutual consent, for their joint advantage and satisfaction,\nopposed to another assembly of the same kind, their avowed enemies and\ndetractors. No wonder, then, that they sought to strengthen themselves\nwith such a valuable acquisition as our hero was likely to prove. The\ncollege consisted of authors only, and these of all degrees in point\nof reputation, from the fabricator of a song, set to music, and sung at\nMarylebone, to the dramatic bard who had appeared in buskins upon the\nstage: nay, one of the members had actually finished eight books of an\nepic poem, for the publication of which he was at that time soliciting\nsubscriptions.\n\nIt cannot be supposed that such a congregation of the sons of Apollo\nwould sit a whole evening with order and decorum, unless they were under\nthe check of some established authority; and this inconvenience having\nbeen foreseen, they had elected a president, vested with full power to\nsilence any member or members that should attempt to disturb the harmony\nand subordination of the whole. The sage, who at this time possessed the\nchair, was a person in years, whose countenance was a lively portraiture\nof that rancorous discontent which follows repeated damnation. He had\nbeen extremely unfortunate in his theatrical productions, and was, to\nuse the words of a profane wag, who assisted at the condemnation of his\nlast play, by this time d--d beyond redemption. Nevertheless, he still\ntarried about the skirts of Parnassus, translating some of the classics,\nand writing miscellanies, and by dint of an invincible assurance,\nsupercilious insolence, the most undaunted virulence of tongue, and some\nknowledge of life, he made shift to acquire and maintain the character\nof a man of learning and wit, in the opinion of people who had neither;\nthat is, thirty-nine in forty of those with whom he associated himself.\nHe was even looked upon in this light by some few of the college; though\nthe major part of those who favoured his election, were such as dreaded\nhis malice, respected his experience and seniority, or hated his\ncompetitor, who was the epic poet.\n\nThe chief end of this society, as I have already hinted, was to assist\nand support each other in their productions, which they mutually\nrecommended to sale, with all their art and influence, not only in\nprivate conversation, but also in occasional epigrams, criticisms, and\nadvertisements, inserted in the public papers. This science, which is\nknown by the vulgar appellation of puffing, they carried to such a pitch\nof finesse, that an author very often wrote an abusive answer to his own\nperformance, in order to inflame the curiosity of the town, by which\nit had been overlooked. Notwithstanding this general unanimity in the\ncollege, a private animosity had long subsisted between the two rivals\nI have mentioned, on account of precedence, to which both laid claim,\nthough, by a majority of votes, it had been decided in favour of the\npresent chairman. The grudge indeed never proceeded to any degree of\noutrage or defiance, but manifested itself at every meeting, in attempts\nto eclipse each other in smart sayings and pregnant repartee; so that\nthere was always a delicate mess of this kind of wit served up in the\nfront of the evening, for the entertainment and example of the junior\nmembers, who never failed to divide upon this occasion, declaring\nthemselves for one or other of the combatants, whom they encouraged by\ntheir looks, gestures, and applause, according to the circumstances of\nthe dispute.\n\nThis honourable consistory was held in the best room of an ale-house,\nwhich afforded wine, punch, or beer, suitable to the purse or\ninclination of every individual, who separately paid for his own choice;\nand here was our hero introduced in the midst of twenty strangers, who,\nby their looks and equipage, formed a very picturesque variety. He was\nreceived with a most gracious solemnity, and placed upon the right\nhand of the president, who, having commanded silence, recited aloud\nhis introductory ode, which met with universal approbation. Then was\ntendered to him the customary oath, obliging him to consult the honour\nand advantage of the society as far as it should he in his power, in\nevery station of life; and this being taken, his temples were bound with\na wreath of laurel, which was kept sacred for such inauguration.\n\nWhen these rites were performed with all due ceremony, the new member\ncast his eyes around the place, and took a more accurate survey of his\nbrethren; among whom he observed a strange collection of periwigs, with\nregard to the colour, fashions, and dimensions, which were such as\nhe had never seen before. Those who sat on each side, nearest the\npresident, were generally distinguished by venerable ties, the foretops\nof which exhibited a surprising diversity; some of them rose slanting\nbackwards, like the glacis of a fortification; some were elevated in\ntwo distinct eminences, like the hills Helicon and Parnassus; and others\nwere curled and reflected, as the horns of Jupiter Ammon. Next to these,\nthe majors took place, many of which were mere succedanea, made by the\napplication of an occasional rose to the tail of a lank bob; and in the\nlower form appeared masses of hair, which would admit of no description.\n\nTheir clothes were tolerably well suited to the furniture of their\nheads, the apparel of the upper bench being decent and clean, while that\nof the second class was threadbare and soiled; and at the lower end\nof the room, he perceived divers efforts made to conceal their\nrent breeches and dirty linen; nay, he could distinguish by their\ncountenances the different kinds of poetry in which they exercised the\nmuse. He saw Tragedy conspicuous in a grave solemnity of regard; Satire\nlouring in a frown of envy and discontent; Elegy whining in a funeral\naspect; Pastoral dozing in a most insipid languor of face; Ode-writing\ndelineated in a distracted stare; and Epigram squinting with a pert\nsneer. Perhaps our hero refined too much in his penetration, when he\naffirmed, that, over and above these discoveries, he could plainly\nperceive the state of every one's finances, and would have undertaken\nto have guessed each particular sum without varying three farthings from\nthe truth. The conversation, instead of becoming general, began to fall\ninto parties; and the epic poet had actually attracted the attention of\na private committee, when the chairman interposed, calling aloud, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo\ncabals, no conspiracies, gentlemen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His rival, thinking it incumbent\nupon him to make some reply to this rebuke, answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have no\nsecrets; he that hath ears, let him hear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This was spoke as an\nintimation to the company, whose looks were instantly whetted with the\nexpectation of their ordinary meal; but the president seemed to decline\nthe contest; for, without putting on his fighting face, he calmly\nreplied, that he had seen Mr. Metaphor tip the wink, and whisper to\none of his confederates, and thence judged, that there was something\nmysterious on the carpet.\n\nThe epic poet, believing his antagonist crest-fallen, resolved to take\nthe advantage of his dejection, that he might enhance his own character\nin the opinion of the stranger; and, with that view, asked, with an air\nof exultation, if a man might not be allowed to have a convulsion in his\neye, without being suspected of a conspiracy? The president, perceiving\nhis drift, and piqued at his presumption, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca\nman of a weak head may be very well supposed to have convulsions in his\neyes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This repartee produced a laugh of triumph among the chairman's\nadherents; one of whom observed, that his rival had got a smart rap on\nthe pate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the bard, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin that respect Mr. Chairman has the\nadvantage of me. Had my head been fortified with a horn-work, I should\nnot have been so sensible of the stroke.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This retort, which carried a\nsevere allusion to the president's wife, lighted up the countenances of\nthe aggressor's friends, which had begun to be a little obumbrated;\nand had a contrary effect upon the other faction, till their chief,\ncollecting all his capacity, returned the salute, by observing, that\nthere was no occasion for a horn-work, when the covered way was not\nworth defending.\n\nSuch a reprisal upon Mr. Metaphor's yoke-fellow, who was by no means\nremarkable for her beauty, could not fail to operate upon the hearers;\nand as for the bard himself, he was evidently ruffled by the reflection;\nto which, however, he, without hesitation, replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEgad! 'tis my\nopinion, that, if your covered way was laid open, few people would\nventure to give the assault.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot unless their batteries were more\neffectual than the fire of your wit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs for\nthat matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the other with precipitation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey would have\nno occasion to batter in breach; they would find the angle of the la\npucelle bastion demolished to their hands--he, he!\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I believe it\nwould surpass your understanding,\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed the chairman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto fill up\nthe fosse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat, I own, is impracticable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the bard, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere I\nshould meet with a hiatus maxime deflendus!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe president, exasperated at this insinuation, in presence of the new\nmember, exclaimed, with indignation in his looks, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yet, if a body\nof pioneers were set at work upon your skull, they would find rubbish\nenough to choke up all the common sewers in town.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here a groan was\nuttered by the admirers of the epic poet, who, taking a pinch of snuff\nwith great composure, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen a man grows scurrilous,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI take it\nfor an undoubted proof of his overthrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf that be the case,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried\nthe other, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou yourself must be the vanquished party, for you were\nthe first that was driven to personal abuse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI appeal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the\nbard, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto those who can distinguish. Gentlemen, your judgment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis reference produced a universal clamour, and the whole college was\ninvolved in confusion. Every man entered into dispute with his neighbour\non the merits of this cause. The chairman interposed his authority in\nvain; the noise grew louder and louder; the disputants waxed warm;\nthe epithets of blockhead, fool, and scoundrel, were bandied about.\nPeregrine enjoyed the uproar, and, leaping upon the table, sounded\nthe charge to battle, which was immediately commenced in ten different\nduels. The lights were extinguished; the combatants thrashed one another\nwithout distinction; the mischievous Pickle distributed sundry random\nblows in the dark, and the people below, being alarmed with the sound\nof application, the overturning of chairs, and the outcries of those who\nwere engaged, came up-stairs in a body with lights to reconnoitre, and,\nif possible, quell this hideous tumult.\n\nObjects were no sooner rendered visible, than the field of battle\nexhibited strange groups of the standing and the fallen. Each of Mr.\nMetaphor's eyes was surrounded with a circle of a livid hue; and the\npresident's nose distilled a quantity of clotted blood. One of the\ntragic authors, finding himself assaulted in the dark, had, by way of a\nponiard, employed upon his adversary's throat a knife which lay upon the\ntable, for the convenience of cutting cheese; but, by the blessing of\nGod, the edge of it was not keen enough to enter the skin, which it had\nonly scratched in divers places. A satirist had almost bit off the ear\nof a lyric bard. Shirts and neckcloths were torn to rags; and there was\nsuch a woeful wreck of periwigs on the floor, that no examination\ncould adjust the property of the owners, the greatest part of whom were\nobliged to use handkerchiefs by way of nightcap.\n\nThe fray, however, ceased at the approach of those who interposed; part\nof the combatants being tired of an exercise in which they had\nreceived nothing but hard blows; part of them being intimidated by the\nremonstrances of the landlord and his company, who threatened to call\nthe watch; and a very few being ashamed of the scandalous dispute\nin which they were detected. But though the battle was ended, it was\nimpossible, for that evening, to restore harmony and good order to the\nsociety, which broke up, after the president had pronounced a short and\nconfused apology to our adventurer, for the indecent uproar which had\nunfortunately happened on the first night of his admission. Indeed,\nPeregrine deliberated with himself, whether or not his reputation would\nallow him to appear again among this venerable fraternity; but, as he\nknew some of them to be men of real genius, how ridiculous soever their\ncarriage might be modified, and was of that laughing disposition, which\nis always seeking food for mirth, as Horace observes of Philippus:\n\nRisus undique quaerit;--\n\nhe resolved to frequent the college, notwithstanding this accident,\nwhich happened at his inauguration; being thereto, moreover, induced by\nhis desire of knowing the private history of the stage, with which he\nsupposed some of the members perfectly well acquainted. He was also\nvisited, before the next meeting, by his introductor, who assured him,\nthat such a tumult had never happened since the first institution of the\nassembly, till that very night; and promised that, for the future, he\nshould have no cause to be scandalized at their behaviour.\n\nPersuaded by these motives and assurances, he trusted himself once more\nin the midst of their community, and everything proceeded with great\ndecorum; all dispute and altercation was avoided, and the college\napplied itself seriously to the purposes of its meeting, namely, to hear\nthe grievances of individuals, and assist them with salutary advice.\nThe first person that craved redress was a noisy North Briton, who\ncomplained, in a strange dialect, that he had, in the beginning of the\nseason, presented a comedy to the manager of a certain theatre, who,\nafter it had lain six weeks in his hands, returned it to the author,\naffirming there was neither sense nor English in the performance.\n\nThe president, who, by the bye, had revised the piece, thinking his own\nreputation concerned, declared, in presence of the whole society,\nthat, with regard to sense, he would not undertake to vindicate the\nproduction; but, in point of language, no fault could be justly laid to\nits charge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe case, however, is very plain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe manager\nnever gave himself the trouble to peruse the play, but formed a judgment\nof it from the conversation of the author, never dreaming that it had\nundergone the revisal of an English writer; be that as it will, you are\ninfinitely obliged to him for having despatched you so soon, and I shall\nhave the better opinion of him for it so long as I live; for I have\nknown other guise authors than you, that is, in point of interest and\nfame, kept in continual attendance and dependence during the best part\nof their lives, and, after all, disappointed in the expectation of\nseeing their performances exhibited on the stage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCIV.\n\n\n\nFurther proceedings of the College.\n\n\nThis affair was no sooner discussed, than another gentleman exhibited a\ncomplaint, signifying, that he had undertaken to translate into English\na certain celebrated author, who had been cruelly mangled by former\nattempts; and that, soon as his design took air, the proprietors of\nthose miserable translations had endeavoured to prejudice his work, by\nindustrious insinuations, contrary to truth and fair dealing, importing,\nthat he did not understand one word of the language which he pretended\nto translate. This being a case that nearly concerned the greatest part\nof the audience, it was taken into serious deliberation. Some observed,\nthat it was not only a malicious effort against the plaintiff, but also\na spiteful advertisement to the public, tending to promote an inquiry\ninto the abilities of all other translators, few of whom, it was well\nknown, were so qualified as to stand the test of such examination.\nOthers said, that over and above this consideration, which ought to have\nits due weight with the college, there was a necessity for concerting\nmeasures to humble the presumption of booksellers, who had, from\ntime immemorial, taken all opportunities to oppress and enslave their\nauthors; not only by limiting men of genius to the wages of journeymen\ntailors, without even allowing them one Sabbath in the week, but also\nin taking such advantages of their necessities as were inconsistent with\njustice and humanity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor example,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one of the members, \u00e2\u0080\u009cafter I myself had acquired a\nlittle reputation with the town, I was caressed by one of those tyrants,\nwho professed a friendship for me, and even supplied me with money,\naccording to the exigencies of my situation; so that I looked upon\nhim as the mirror of disinterested benevolence; and had he known my\ndisposition, and treated me accordingly, I should have writ for him upon\nhis own terms. After I had used his friendship in this manner for some\ntime, I happened to have occasion for a small sum of money, and with\ngreat confidence made another application to my good friend; when all of\na sudden he put a stop to his generosity, refused to accommodate me\nin the most abrupt and mortifying style; and though I was at that time\npretty far advanced in a work for his benefit, which was a sufficient\nsecurity for what I owed him, he roundly asked, how I proposed to pay\nthe money which I had already borrowed? Thus was I used like a young w--\njust come upon the town, whom the b--d allows to run into her debt,\nthat she may have it in her power to oppress her at pleasure; and if the\nsufferer complains, she is treated like the most ungrateful wretch\nupon earth; and that too with such appearance of reason, as may easily\nmislead an unconcerned spectator. 'You unthankful drab!' she will say,\n'didn't I take you into my house when you hadn't a shift to your back,\na petticoat to your tail, nor a morsel of bread to put into your belly?\nHan't I clothed you from head to foot like a gentlewoman, supported you\nwith board, lodging, and all necessaries, till your own extravagance\nhath brought you into distress; and now you have the impudence, you\nnasty, stinking, brimstone bungaway! to say you are hardly dealt with,\nwhen I demand no more than my own?' Thus the w-- and the author are\nequally oppressed, and even left without the melancholy privilege of\ncomplaining; so that they are fain to subscribe to such terms as their\ncreditors shall please to impose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis illustration operated so powerfully upon the conviction and\nresentment of the whole college, that revenge was universally denounced\nagainst those who had aggrieved the plaintiff; and, after some debate,\nit was agreed that he should make a new translation of some other\nsaleable book, in opposition to a former version belonging to the\ndelinquents, and print it in such a small size as would enable him\nto undersell their property; and that this new translation should\nbe recommended and introduced into the world with the whole art and\ninfluence of the society.\n\nThis affair being settled to the satisfaction of all present, an author\nof some character stood up, and craved the advice and assistance of his\nfellows, in punishing a certain nobleman of great pretensions to taste,\nwho, in consequence of a production which this gentleman had ushered\ninto the world with universal applause, not only desired, but even\neagerly courted his acquaintance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe invited me to his house,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhere I was overwhelmed with civility and professions of friendship.\nHe insisted upon my treating him as an intimate, and calling upon him at\nall hours, without ceremony; he made me promise to breakfast with him\nat least three times a week. In short, I looked upon myself as very\nfortunate, in meeting with such advances from a man of his interest and\nreputation, who had it in his power to befriend me effectually in my\npassage through life; and, that I might not give him any cause to think\nI neglected his friendship, I went to his house in two days, with a view\nof drinking chocolate, according to appointment; but he had been so\nmuch fatigued with dancing at an assembly overnight, that his\nvalet-de-chambre would not venture to wake him so early; and I left my\ncompliments to his lordship, with a performance in manuscript, which he\nhad expressed a most eager desire to peruse. I repeated my visit next\nmorning, that his impatience to see me might not have some violent\neffect upon his constitution; and received a message from his minister,\nsignifying, that he had been highly entertained with the manuscript I\nhad left, a great part of which he had read, but was at present so busy\nin contriving a proper dress for a private masquerade, which would\nbe given that same evening, that he could not have the pleasure of my\ncompany at breakfast. This was a feasible excuse, which I admitted\naccordingly, and in a day or two appeared again, when his lordship was\nparticularly engaged. This might possibly be the case; and therefore I\nreturned the fourth time, in hopes of finding him more at leisure;\nbut he had gone out about half an hour before my arrival, and left my\nperformance with his valet-de-chambre, who assured me, that his lord\nhad perused it with infinite pleasure. Perhaps I might have retired very\nwell satisfied with this declaration, had not I, in my passage through\nthe hall, heard one of the footmen upon the top of the staircase,\npronounce with an audible voice, 'Will your lordship please to be at\nhome when he calls?' It is not to be supposed that I was pleased at this\ndiscovery, which I no sooner made, than, turning to my conductor, 'I\nfind,' said I, 'his lordship is disposed to be abroad to more people\nthan me this morning.' The fellow, though a valet-de-chambre, blushed at\nthis observation; and I withdrew, not a little irritated at the peer's\ndisingenuity, and fully resolved to spare him my visits for the future.\nIt was not long after this occasion, that I happened to meet him in\nthe park, and being naturally civil, I could not pass him without a\nsalutation of the hat, which he returned in the most distant manner,\nthough we were both solitary, and not a soul within view, and when that\nvery performance, which he had applauded so warmly, was lately published\nby subscription, he did not bespeak so much as one copy. I have often\nreflected with wonder upon this inconsistency of his conduct. I never\ncourted his patronage, nor indeed thought of his name, until he\nmade interest for my acquaintance; and if he was disappointed in my\nconversation, why did he press me so much to further connection?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe case is very clear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the chairman, interrupting him; \u00e2\u0080\u009che is\none of those connoisseurs who set up for taste, and value themselves\nupon knowing all men of genius, whom they would be thought to assist\nin their productions. I will lay an even bet with any man, that his\nlordship on the strength of that slender interview, together with the\nopportunity of having seen your performance in manuscript, has already\nhinted to every company in which he is conversant, that you solicited\nhis assistance in retouching the piece, which you have now offered to\nthe public, and that he was pleased to favour you with his advice,\nbut found you obstinately bigoted to your own opinion, in some points\nrelating to those very passages which have not met with the approbation\nof the town. As for his caresses, there was nothing at all extraordinary\nin his behaviour. By that time you have lived to my age, you will not\nbe surprised to see a courtier's promise and performance of a different\ncomplexion; not but that I would willingly act as an auxiliary in your\nresentment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe opinion of the president was strengthened by the concurrence of all\nthe members; and all other complaints and memorials being deferred till\nanother sitting, the college proceeded to an exercise of wit, which was\ngenerally performed once every fortnight, with a view to promote the\nexpectoration of genius. The subject was occasionally chosen by the\nchairman, who opened the game with some shrewd remark naturally arising\nfrom the conversation; and then the ball was tossed about, from one\ncorner of the room to the other, according to the motions of the spirit.\n\nThat the reader may have a just idea of this sport, and of the abilities\nof those who carried it on, I shall repeat the sallies of this evening,\naccording to the order and succession in which they escaped. One of the\nmembers observing that Mr. Metaphor was absent, was told by the person\nwho sat next to him, that the poet had foul weather at home, and could\nnot stir abroad. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the president, interposing, with the\nsignal upon his countenance, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis he wind-bound, in port?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWine-bound,\nI suppose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried another. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHooped with wine! a strange metaphor!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthe third. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot if he has got into a hogshead,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the fourth.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe hogshead will sooner get into him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied a fifth; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit must be a\ntun or an ocean.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo wonder then, if he should be overwhelmed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\na sixth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf he should,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried a seventh, \u00e2\u0080\u009che will cast up when his gall\nbreaks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat must be very soon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d roared an eighth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor it has been\nlong ready to burst.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d observed a ninth, \u00e2\u0080\u009che'll stick fast\nat the bottom, take my word for it; he has a natural alacrity in\nsinking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d remarked a tenth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have seen him in the\nclouds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen was he cloudy, I suppose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the eleventh.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo dark,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the other, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat his meaning could not be\nperceived.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor all that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the twelfth, \u00e2\u0080\u009che is easily seen\nthrough.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou talk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the thirteenth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas if his head was made\nof glass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the fourteenth, \u00e2\u0080\u009chis head is made of more\ndurable stuff; it will bend before it breaks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYet I have seen it\nbroken,\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed the president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you perceive any wit come out\nat the whole?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said another. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis wit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the chairman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis too\nsubtle to be perceived.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA third mouth was just open, when the exercise was suddenly interrupted\nby the dreadful cry of \u00e2\u0080\u009cFire!\u00e2\u0080\u009d which issued from the kitchen, and\ninvolved the whole college in confusion. Every man endeavoured to be\nthe first in making his exit, the door and passage were blocked up; each\nindividual was pommelled by the person that happened to be behind him.\nThis communication produced noise and exclamation; clouds of smoke\nrolled upwards into the apartment, and terror sat on every brow; when\nPeregrine, seeing no prospect of retreating by the door, opened one of\nthe windows, and fairly leaped into the street, where he found a crowd\nof people assembled to contribute their assistance in extinguishing the\nflames. Several members of the college followed his example, and happily\naccomplished their escape. The chairman himself, being unwilling to use\nthe same expedient, stood trembling on the brink of descent, dubious\nof his own agility, and dreading the consequence of such a leap, when\na chair happening to pass, he laid hold on the opportunity, and by an\nexertion of his muscles, pitched upon the top of the carriage, which was\nimmediately overturned in the kennel, to the grievous annoyance of the\nfare, which happened to be a certain effeminate beau, in full dress, on\nhis way to a private assembly.\n\nThis phantom hearing the noise overhead, and feeling the shock of being\noverthrown at the same time, thought that some whole tenement had fallen\nupon the chair, and, in the terror of being crushed to pieces, uttered\na scream, which the populace supposed to proceed from the mouth of a\nwoman; and therefore went to his assistance, while the chairmen, instead\nof ministering to his occasions, no sooner recollected themselves,\nthan they ran in pursuit of their overthrower, who, being accustomed\nto escape from bailiffs, dived into a dark alley, and, vanishing in a\ntrice, was not visible to any living soul, until he appeared next day on\nTower-hill.\n\nThe humane part of the mob, who bestirred themselves for the relief of\nthe supposed lady, no sooner perceived their mistake in the appearance\nof the beau, who stared around him with horror and affright, than their\ncompassion was changed into mirth, and they began to pass a great\nmany unsavoury jokes upon his misfortune, which they now discovered no\ninclination to alleviate; and he found himself very uncomfortably\nbeset, when Pickle, pitying his situation, interposed in his behalf, and\nprevailed upon the chairmen to carry him into the house of an apothecary\nin the neighbourhood, to whom his mischance proved a very advantageous\naccident; for the fright operated so violently upon his nerves, that he\nwas seized with a delirium, and lay a whole fortnight deprived of his\nsenses; during which period he was not neglected in point of medicines,\nfood, and attendance, but royally regaled, as appeared by the contents\nof his landlord's bill.\n\nOur adventurer having seen this unfortunate beau safely housed, returned\nto the scene of the other calamity, which, as it was no other than a\nfoul chimney, soon yielded to the endeavours of the family, and was\nhappily overcome, without any other bad consequence than that of\nalarming the neighbours, disturbing the college, and disordering\nthe brain of a beau. Eager to be acquainted with the particular\nconstitutions of a society which seemed to open upon him by degrees,\nMr. Pickle did not fail to appear at the next meeting, when several\npetitions were laid before the board, in behalf of those members who\nwere confined in the prisons of the Fleet, Marshalsea, and King's Bench.\nAs those unhappy authors expected nothing from their brethren but advice\nand good offices, which did not concern the purse, the memorials were\nconsidered with great care and humanity; and, upon this occasion,\nPeregrine had it in his power to manifest his importance to the\ncommunity; for he happened to be acquainted with the creditor of one\nof the prisoners, and knew that gentleman's severity was owing to his\nresentment at the behaviour of the debtor, who had lampooned him in\nprint, because he refused to comply with a fresh demand, after he had\nlent him money to the amount of a considerable sum. Our young gentleman,\ntherefore, understanding that the author was penitent, and disposed to\nmake a reasonable submission, promised to employ his influence with the\ncreditor towards an accommodation; and in a few days actually obtained\nhis release.\n\nThe social duties being discharged, the conversation took a general\nturn, and several new productions were freely criticised; those\nespecially which belonged to authors who were either unconnected with,\nor unknown to the college. Nor did the profession of stage-playing\nescape the cognizance of the assembly; a deputation of the most\njudicious members being sent weekly to each theatre, with a view of\nmaking remarks upon the performance of the actors. The censors for the\npreceding week were accordingly called upon to give in their report; and\nthe play which they had reviewed was \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Revenge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Q--,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the second censor, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctake him all in all, is certainly\nthe most complete and unblemished performer that ever appeared on our\nstage, notwithstanding the blind adoration which is paid to his rival.\nI went two nights ago, with an express design to criticise his action. I\ncould find no room for censure, but infinite subject for admiration\nand applause. In Pierre he is great, in Othello excellent, but in Zanga\nbeyond all imitation. Over and above the distinctness of pronunciation,\nthe dignity of attitude, and expression of face, his gestures are so\njust and significant, that a man, though utterly bereft of the sense of\nhearing, might, by seeing him only, understand the meaning of every word\nhe speaks! Sure nothing can be more exquisite than his manner of telling\nIsabella how Alonzo behaved, when he found the incendiary letter\nwhich he had dropped by the Moor's direction; and when, to crown his\nvengeance, he discovers himself to be the contriver of all the mischief\nthat had happened, he manifests a perfect masterpiece of action, in\npronouncing these four little monosyllables, 'Know, then, 'twas--I.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPeregrine having eyed the critic some minutes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI fancy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cyour praise must be ironical, because, in the very two situations you\nmention, I think I have seen that player outherod Herod, or, in other\nwords, exceed all his other extravagances. The intention of the author\nis, that the Moor should communicate to his confidant a piece of\ninformation contained in a few lines, which, doubtless, ought to\nbe repeated with an air of eagerness and satisfaction, not with the\nridiculous grimace of a monkey, to which, methought, his action bore an\nintimate resemblance, in uttering this plain sentence:--\n\n     ----He took it up:\n     But scarce was it unfolded to his sight,\n     When he, as if an arrow pierc'd his eye,\n     Started, and trembling dropp'd it on the ground.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn pronouncing the first two words, this egregious actor stoops down,\nand seems to take up something from the stage, then proceeding to repeat\nwhat follows, mimics the manner of unfolding a letter; when he mentions\nthe simile of an arrow piercing the eye, he darts his forefinger towards\nthat organ, then recoils with great violence when the word 'started' is\nexpressed; and when he comes to 'trembling dropp'd it on the ground,' he\nthrows all his limbs into a tremulous motion, and shakes the imaginary\npaper from his hand. The latter part of the description is carried on\nwith the same minute gesticulation, while he says:--\n\n     Pale and aghast awhile my victim stood,\n     Disguis'd a sigh or two, and puff'd them from him;\n     Then rubb'd his brow, and took it up again.\n\nThe player's countenance assumes a wild stare, he sighs twice most\npiteously, as if he were on the point of suffocation, scrubs his\nforehead, and, bending his body, apes the action of snatching an object\nfrom the floor. Nor is this dexterity of dumb-show omitted, when he\nconcludes his imitation in these three lines:--\n\n     At first he look'd as if he meant to read it;\n     But check'd by rising fears, he crushed it thus,\n     And thrust it, like an adder, in his bosom.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere the judicious performer imitates the confusion and concern of\nAlonzo, seems to cast his eyes upon something, from which they are\nimmediately withdrawn with horror and precipitation then shutting\nhis fist with a violent squeeze, as if he intended to make immediate\napplication to Isabella's nose, he rams it in his own bosom, with all\nthe horror and agitation of a thief taken in the manner. Were the player\ndebarred the use of speech, and obliged to act to the eyes only of the\naudience, this mimicry might be a necessary conveyance of his meaning;\nbut when he is at liberty to signify his ideas by language, nothing can\nbe more trivial, forced, unnatural, and antic, than this mummery. Not\nthat I would exclude from the representation the graces of action,\nwithout which the choicest sentiments, clothed in the most exquisite\nexpression, would appear unanimated and insipid; but these are as\ndifferent from this ridiculous burlesque, as is the demeanour of a Tully\nin the rostrum, from the tricks of a Jack-pudding on a mountebank's\nstage. And, for the truth of what I allege, I appeal to the observation\nof any person who has considered the elegance of attitude and propriety\nof gesture, as they are universally acknowledged in the real characters\nof life. Indeed, I have known a Gascon, whose limbs were eloquent as\nhis tongue: he never mentioned the word sleep without reclining his\nhead upon his hand; when he had occasion to talk of a horse, he always\nstarted up and trotted across the room, except when he was so situated\nthat he could not stir without incommoding the company, and in that case\nhe contented himself with neighing aloud. If a dog happened to be the\nsubject of his conversation, he wagged his tail, and grinned in a\nmost significant manner; and one day he expressed his desire of going\nbackwards with such natural imitation of his purpose, that everybody in\nthe room firmly believed he had actually overshot himself, and fortified\ntheir nostrils accordingly. Yet no man ever looked upon this virtuoso to\nbe the standard of propriety in point of speaking and deportment. For\nmy own part, I confess the player in question would, by dint of these\nqualifications, make a very good figure in the character of Pantaloon's\nlacquey, in the entertainment of 'Perseus and Andromeda,' and perhaps\nmight acquire some reputation, by turning 'the Revenge' into a\npantomime; in which case, I would advise him to come upon the stage,\nprovided with a handful of flour, in order to besmear his face when he\npronounces 'pale and aghast,' etc.; and methinks he ought to illustrate\nthe adder with a hideous hiss. But let us now come to the other\nsituation, in which this modern Aesopus is supposed to distinguish\nhimself so much--I mean that same eclaircissement comprehended in 'Know\nthen, 'twas--I.' His manner, I own, may be altered since I was present\nat the representation of that performance; but certain I am, when I\nbeheld him in that critical conjuncture, his behaviour appeared to me\nso uncouth, that I really imagined he was visited by some epileptic\ndistemper; for he stood tottering and gasping for the space of two\nminutes, like a man suddenly struck with the palsy; and, after various\ndistortions and side-shakings, as if he had got fleas in his doublet,\nheaved up from his lungs the letter I, like a huge anchor from foul\nground.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis criticism was acceptable to the majority of the college, who had\nno great veneration for the player in question; and his admirer, without\nmaking any reply, asked in a whisper, of the gentleman who sat next to\nhim, if Pickle had not offered some production to the stage, and met\nwith a repulse.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCV.\n\n\n\nThe young Gentleman is introduced to a Virtuoso of the first Order, and\ncommences Yelper.\n\n\nHitherto Peregrine had professed himself an author, without reaping the\nfruits of that occupation, except the little fame he had acquired by\nhis late satire; but now he thought it high time to weigh solid pudding\nagainst empty praise; and therefore engaged with some booksellers in\na certain translation, which he obliged himself to perform for the\nconsideration of two hundred pounds. The articles of agreement being\ndrawn, he began his task with great eagerness, rose early in the morning\nto his work, at which he laboured all day long, went abroad with the\nbats in the evening, and appeared in the coffee-house, where he amused\nhimself with the newspapers and conversation till nine o'clock; then he\nretired to his own apartment, and, after a slight repast, betook himself\nto rest, that he might be able to unroost with the cock. This sudden\nchange from his former way of life agreed so ill with his disposition,\nthat, for the first time, he was troubled with flatulencies and\nindigestion, which produced anxiety and dejection of spirits, and the\nnature of his situation began in some measure to discompose his brain; a\ndiscovery which he no sooner made, than he had recourse to the advice of\na young physician, who was a member of the college of authors, at this\ntime one of our hero's most intimate acquaintance.\n\nThe son of Esculapius, having considered his case, imputed his disorder\nto the right cause, namely, want of exercise; dissuaded him from such\nclose application to study, until he should be gradually familiarized\nto a sedentary life; advised him to enjoy his friend and his bottle in\nmoderation, and wean himself from his former customs by degrees;\nand, above all things, to rise immediately after his first sleep, and\nexercise himself in a morning's walk. In order to render this last part\nof the prescription the more palatable, the doctor promised to attend\nhim in these early excursions, and even to introduce him to a certain\npersonage of note, who gave a sort of public breakfasting to the minor\nvirtuosi of the age, and often employed his interest in behalf of those\nwho properly cultivated his countenance and approbation.\n\nThis proposal was extremely acceptable to our young gentleman, who,\nbesides the advantage which might accrue to him from such a valuable\nconnection, foresaw much entertainment and satisfaction in the discourse\nof so many learned guests. The occasions of his health and interest,\nmoreover, coincided in another circumstance; the minister's levee being\nkept betimes in the morning, so that he could perform his walk, yield\nhis attendance, and breakfast at this philosophical board, without\nencroaching a great deal upon his other avocations. Measures being thus\npreconcerted, the physician conducted our adventurer to the house of\nthis celebrated sage, to whom he recommended him as a gentleman of\ngenius and taste, who craved the honour of his acquaintance; but he\nhad previously smoothed the way to his introduction, by representing\nPeregrine as a young fellow of great ambition, spirit, and address, who\ncould not fail to make a figure in the world; that therefore he would be\na creditable addition to the subordinates of such a patron, and by his\nqualifications, intrepidity, and warmth of temper, turn out a consummate\nherald of his fame. Upon these considerations, he met with a most\nengaging reception from the entertainer, who was a well-bred man, of\nsome learning, generosity, and taste; but his foible was the desire of\nbeing thought the inimitable pattern of all three.\n\nIt was with a view to acquire and support this character, that his\nhouse was open to all those who had any pretensions to literature;\nconsequently he was surrounded by a strange variety of pretenders; but\nnone were discouraged, because he knew that even the most insignificant\nmight, in some shape, conduce to the propagation of his praise. A\nbabbler, though he cannot run upon the scent, may spring the game, and,\nby his yelping, help to fill up the cry. No wonder, then, that a youth\nof Pickle's accomplishments was admitted and even invited into the pack.\nAfter having enjoyed a very short private audience in the closet, our\nyoung gentleman was shown into another room, where half a dozen of his\nfellow-adherents waited for the Maecenas, who in a few minutes appeared,\nwith a most gracious aspect, received the compliments of the morning,\nand sat down to breakfast, in the midst of them, without any further\nceremony.\n\nThe conversation at first turned upon the weather, which was\ninvestigated in a very philosophical manner by one of the company, who\nseemed to have consulted all the barometers and thermometers that ever\nwere invented, before he would venture to affirm that it was a chill\nmorning. This subject being accurately discussed, the chief inquired\nabout the news of the learned world; and his inclination was no sooner\nexpressed than every guest opened his mouth, in order to ratify his\ncuriosity. But he that first captivated his attention was a meagre,\nshrivelled antiquary, who looked like an animated mummy, which had been\nscorched among the sands of the desert. He told the patron, that he had,\nby accident, met with a medal, which, though it was defaced by time, he\nwould venture to pronounce a genuine antique, from the ringing and taste\nof the metal, as well as from the colour and composition of the rust. So\nsaying, he produced a piece of copper coin, so consumed and disguised\nby age, that scarce a vestige of the impression was to be perceived.\nNevertheless, this connoisseur pretended to distinguish a face in\nprofile, from which he concluded that the piece was of the Upper Empire,\nand on the reverse he endeavoured to point out the bulb of the spear,\nand part of the parazonium, which were the insignia of the Roman Virtus,\ntogether with the fragment of one fold of the multicium in which she was\nclothed. He likewise had discovered an angle of the letter N, and, at\nsome distance, an entire I; from these circumstances conjecturing, and\nindeed concluding, that the medal was struck by Severus, in honour of\nthe victory he obtained over his rival Niger, after he had forced the\npasses of Mount Taurus. This criticism seemed very satisfactory to\nthe entertainer, who, having examined the coin by the help of his\nspectacles, plainly discerned the particulars which the owner had\nmentioned, and was pleased to term his account of the matter a very\ningenious explanation.\n\nThe curiosity was circulated through the hands of all present, and every\nvirtuoso, in his turn, licked the copper, and rung it upon the hearth,\ndeclaring his assent to the judgment which had been pronounced. At\nlength it fell under the inspection of our young gentleman, who, though\nno antiquarian, was very well acquainted with the current coin of his\nown country, and no sooner cast his eyes upon the valuable antique, than\nhe affirmed, without hesitation, that it was no other than the ruins of\nan English farthing, and that same spear, parazonium, and multicium, the\nremains of the emblems and drapery with which the figure of Britannia\nis delineated on our copper money. This hardy asseveration seemed to\ndisconcert the patron while it incensed the medallist, who, grinning\nlike an enraged baboon, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat d'ye tell me of a brass farthing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nhe. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you ever know modern brass of such a relish? Do but taste it,\nyoung gentleman; and sure I am, if you have ever been conversant with\nsubjects of this kind, you will find as wide a difference in the savour\nbetween this and an English farthing as can possibly be perceived\nbetwixt an onion and a turnip. Besides, this medal has the true\nCorinthian ring; then the attitude is upright, whereas that of Britannia\nis reclining; and how is it possible to mistake a branch of palm for a\nparazonium?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAll the rest of the company espoused the virtuoso's side of the\nquestion, because the reputation of each was concerned. The patron,\nfinding himself in the same circumstance, assumed a solemnity of\nfeature, dashed with a small mixture of displeasure, and told Peregrine,\nthat as he had not made that branch of literature his particular\nstudy, he was not surprised to see him mistaken in his opinion. Pickle\nimmediately understood the reproof, though he was shocked at the vanity\nor infatuation of his entertainer and fellow-guests; asked pardon for\nhis presumption, which was accordingly excused, in consideration of his\ninexperience; and the English farthing was dignified with the title of a\ntrue antique.\n\nThe next person that addressed himself to the chief was a gentleman of a\nvery mathematical turn, who valued himself upon the improvements he had\nmade in several domestic machines, and now presented the plan of a new\ncontrivance for cutting cabbages, in such a manner as would secure the\nstock against the rotting rain, and enable it to produce a plenteous\naftercrop of delicious sprouts. In this important machine he had united\nthe whole mechanic powers, with such massy complication of iron and\nwood, that it could not have been moved without the assistance of\na horse, and a road made for the convenience of the draught. These\nobjections were so obvious, that they occurred at first sight to the\ninspector-general, who greatly commended the invention, which, he\nobserved, might be applied to several other useful purposes, could it\nonce be rendered a little more portable and commodious.\n\nThe inventor, who had not foreseen these difficulties, was not prepared\nto surmount them; but he took the hint in good part, and promised to\ntask his abilities anew, in altering the construction of his design. Not\nbut that he underwent some severe irony from the rest of the virtuosi,\nwho complimented him upon the momentous improvement he had made, by\nwhich a family might save a dish of greens in a quarter, for so trifling\nan expense as that of purchasing, working, and maintaining such a\nstupendous machine; but no man was ever more sarcastic in his remarks\nupon this piece of mechanism than the naturalist, who next appealed to\nthe patron's approbation for a curious disposition he had made touching\nthe procreation of muck-flies, in which he had laid down a curious\nmethod of collecting, preserving, and hatching the eggs of these\ninsects, even in the winter, by certain modifications of artificial\nheat. The nature of this discovery was no sooner communicated, than\nPeregrine, unable to contain himself, was seized with a fit of laughter,\nwhich infected every person at the table, the landlord himself not\nexcepted, who found it impossible to preserve his wonted gravity of\nface.\n\nSuch unmannerly mirth did not fail to mortify the philosopher, who,\nafter some pause, during which indignation and disdain were painted in\nhis countenance, reprehended our young gentleman for his unphilosophical\nbehaviour, and undertook to prove, that the subject of his inquiry\nwas of infinite consequence to the progress and increase of natural\nknowledge. But he found no quarter from the vengeful engineer, who now\nretorted his ironical compliments, with great emphasis, upon this hotbed\nfor the generation of vermin, and advised him to lay the whole process\nbefore the Royal Society, which would, doubtless, present him with a\nmedal, and give him a place among their memoirs, as a distinguished\npromoter of the useful arts. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou had employed your\nstudies in finding out some effectual method to destroy those insects\nwhich prejudice and annoy mankind, in all probability you must have\nbeen contented with the contemplation of the good you had done; but this\ncurious expedient for multiplying maggots will surely entitle you to an\nhonourable rank in the list of learned philosophers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't wonder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n replied the naturalist, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you should be so much averse to the\npropagation of insects, because, in all likelihood, you are afraid that\nthey will not leave you a cabbage to cut down with the same miraculous\nmachine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the mechanic, with great bitterness of\nvoice and aspect, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif the cabbage be as light-headed as some muck-worm\nphilosophers, it will not be worth cutting down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never dispute\nupon cabbage with the son of a cucumber,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the fly-breeder, alluding\nto the pedigree of his antagonist; who, impatient of the affront,\nstarted up with fury in his looks, exclaiming, \u00e2\u0080\u009c'Sdeath! meaning me,\nsir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere the patron, perceiving things drawing towards a rupture, interposed\nhis authority, rebuking them for their intemperance and recommending\nto them amity and concord against the Goths and Vandals of the age, who\ntook all opportunities of ridiculing and discouraging the adherents of\nknowledge and philosophy. After this exhortation, they had no pretence\nfor carrying on the dispute, which was dropped in all appearance, though\nthe mechanic still retained his resentment; and after breakfast, when\nthe company broke up, accosted his adversary in the street, desiring to\nknow how he durst be so insolent as to make that scurrilous reflection\nupon his family. The fly-fancier, thus questioned, accused the\nmathematician of having been the aggressor, in likening his head to\na light cabbage; and here the altercation being renewed, the engineer\nproceeded to the illustration of his mechanics, tilting up his hand\nlike a balance, thrusting it forward by way of lever, embracing the\nnaturalist's nose like a wedge betwixt two of his fingers, and turning\nit round, with the momentum of a screw or peritrochium. Had they been\nobliged to decide the dispute with equal arms, the assailant would have\nhad great advantage over the other, who was very much his inferior in\nmuscular strength; but the philosopher being luckily provided with a\ncane, no sooner disengaged himself from this opprobrious application,\nthan he handled his weapon with great dexterity about the head and\nshoulders of his antagonist, who, finding this shower of blows very\ndisagreeable, was fain to betake himself to his heels for shelter, and\nwas pursued by the angry victor, who chased him from one end of\nthe street to the other, affording unspeakable satisfaction to the\nmultitude, as well as to our hero and to his introductor, who were\nspectators of the whole scene.\n\nThus was our adventurer initiated into the society of Yelpers, though\nhe did not as yet fully understand the nature of his office, which was\nexplained by the young physician, who chid him for his blunt behaviour\nin the case of the medal; and gave him to understand, that their\npatron's favour was neither to be gained nor preserved by any man that\nwould pretend to convict him of a mistake. He therefore counselled him\nto respect this foible, and cultivate the old gentleman with all the\nzeal and veneration which a regard to his own character would permit him\nto say. This task was the easier to one of our young gentleman's pliant\ndisposition, because the virtuoso's behaviour was absolutely free from\nthat insolent self-conceit, which he could not bear without disgust. The\nsenior was, on the contrary, mild and beneficent; and Pickle was rather\npleased than shocked at his weakness; because it flattered his vanity\nwith the supposition of his own superior sense. Cautioned in this\nmanner, Peregrine profited so much by his insinuating qualifications,\nthat, in a very little time, he was looked upon as one of the chief\nfavourites of the patron, to whom he dedicated a small occasional poem;\nand everybody believed he would reap the fruits of his attachment among\nthe first of the old gentleman's dependents.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCVI.\n\n\n\nPeregrine, finding himself neglected by Sir Steady Steerwell,\nexpostulates with him in a Letter; in consequence of which he is forbid\nhis House, loses his Pension, and incurs the charge of Lunacy.\n\n\nThis prospect of success, together with his expectations from the\nminister, whom he did not neglect, helped to comfort him under the\nreverse of fortune which he had undergone, and the uncertainty of the\nlawsuit, which he still maintained for the recovery of his ten thousand\npounds. The lawyers, indeed, continued to drain his pocket of money,\nwhile they filled his brain with unsubstantial hope; and he was actually\nobliged to borrow money from his bookseller, on the strength of the\ntranslation, in order to satisfy the demands of those ravenous harpies,\nrather than lay the misanthrope under any difficulties, or have recourse\nto his friend Hatchway, who lived at the garrison, entirely ignorant\nof his distress. This was not at all alleviated by the arrival of the\nIndiaman, in which he had ventured seven hundred pounds, as we have\nalready observed; for he was given to understand, that the borrower was\nleft dangerously ill at Bombay when the ship sailed, and that his chance\nfor retrieving his money was extremely slender.\n\nSo situated, it is not to be supposed that he led a life of tranquility,\nthough he made a shift to struggle with the remonstrances of misfortune.\nYet such a gush of affliction would sometimes rush upon his thought, as\noverwhelmed all the ideas of his hope, and sunk him to the very bottom\nof despondence. Every equipage that passed him in the street, every\nperson of rank and fortune that occurred to his view, recalled the gay\nimages of his former life, with such mortifying reflection as stabbed\nhim to the very soul. He lived, therefore, incessantly exposed to all\nthe pangs of envy and disquiet. When I say envy, I do not mean that\nsordid passion, in consequence of which a man repines at his neighbour's\nsuccess, howsoever deserved: but that self-tormenting indignation which\nis inspired by the prosperity of folly, ignorance, and vice. Without the\nintervening gleams of enjoyment, which he felt in the conversation of a\nfew friends, he could not have supported his existence; or, at least,\nhe must have suffered some violent discomposure of the brain. But one\nis still finding some circumstance of alleviation, even in the worst of\nconjunctures, and Pickle was so ingenious in these researches, that he\nmaintained a good battle with disappointment, till the revolution of the\nterm at which he had received his pension of three hundred pounds.\n\nHowever, seeing the day elapse without touching his allowance,\nnotwithstanding his significant method of presenting himself at the\nminister's levee, when the year was expired, he wrote a letter to Sir\nSteady, reminding him of his situation and promise, and giving him to\nunderstand, that his occasions were such as compelled him to demand\nhis salary for the ensuing year. In the morning after this letter was\nconveyed, the author went to his honour's house, in expectation of being\nadmitted by particular order; but was mistaken in his hope, the minister\nnot being visible. He then made his appearance at the levee, in hopes\nof being closeted; but, though he took all opportunities of watching Sir\nSteady's eyes, he could not obtain one glance, and had the pleasure of\nseeing him retire, without being favoured with the least notice. These\ncircumstances of wilful neglect were not over and above agreeable to our\nyoung hero, who, in the agonies of vexation and resentment, went\nhome, and composed a most acrimonious remonstrance to his honour; in\nconsequence of which he was not only deprived of all pretensions to a\nprivate audience, but expressly denied admittance on a public day, by\nSir Steady's own order.\n\nThis prohibition, which announced his total ruin, filled him with rage,\nhorror, and despair. He insulted the porter who signified the minister's\ncommand, threatening to chastise him upon the spot for his presumption,\nand vented the most virulent imprecations upon his master, to the\nastonishment of those who chanced to enter during this conference.\nHaving exhausted himself in these vain exclamations, he returned to his\nlodgings in a most frantic condition, biting his lips so that the blood\nran from his mouth, dashing his head and fists against the sides of his\nchimney, and weeping with the most bitter expressions of woe. Pipes,\nwhose perception had been just sufficient to let him see that there was\nsome difference between the present and former situation of his master,\noverhearing his transports, essayed to enter his apartment, with a\nview of administering consolation; and, finding the door locked on the\ninside, desired admittance, protesting, that otherwise he would down\nwith the bulkhead in the turning of a handspike. Peregrine ordered him\nto retire, on pain of his displeasure, and swore, that if he should\noffer to break open the door, he would instantly shoot him through\nthe head. Tom, without paying the least regard to this injunction, set\nhimself at work immediately. His master, exasperated at his want of\nreverence and respect, which in his present paroxysm appeared with the\nmost provoking aggravation, flew into his closet, and snatching up\none of his pistols already loaded, no sooner saw his valet enter the\napartment, in consequence of having forced the lock, than he presented\nit full at his face, and drew the trigger. Happily the priming flashed\nin the pan, without communicating with the charge; so that his furious\npurpose did not take effect upon the countenance of honest Pipes, who,\ndisregardful of the attempt, though he knew the contents of the piece,\nasked, without the least alteration of feature, if it must be foul\nweather through the whole voyage.\n\nPeregrine, mad as he was, repented of his mischievous intent against\nsuch a faithful adherent, in the very moment of execution; and had it\nproved fatal, according to the design, in all probability he would have\napplied another to his own head. There are certain considerations that\nstrike upon the mind with irresistible force, even in the midst of\nits distraction; the momentary recollection of some particular scene,\noccasioned by the features of the devoted victim, hath often struck the\ndagger from the assassin's hand. By such an impulse was Pipes protected\nfrom any repeated effort of his master's rage; the friendly cause of his\npresent disobedience flashed upon the conviction of Peregrine, when he\nbeheld the rugged front of his valet, in which also stood disclosed\nhis long and faithful service together with the recommendation of the\ndeceased commodore. Though his wrath was immediately suppressed, and his\nheart torn with remorse for what he had done, his brows remained\nstill contracted, and darting a most ferocious regard at the intruder,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVillain!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow dare you treat me with such disrespect?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy shouldn't I lend a hand for the preservation of the ship,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nthe unruffled Pipes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen there is more sail than ballast aboard, and\nthe pilot quits the helm in despair? What signifies one or two broken\nvoyages, so long as our timbers are strong, and our vessel in good trim?\nIf she loses upon one tack, mayhap she may gain upon t'other; and I'll\nbe d--d, if one day or other we don't fetch up our leeway. As for the\nmatter of provision, you have started a pretty good stock of money into\nmy hold, and you are welcome to hoist it up again when you wool.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere Tom was interrupted by the arrival of Mr. Crabtree, who seeing\nPeregrine with a pistol in his hand, and such wild disorder in his\nlooks, his head, hands, and mouth besmeared with blood, and, moreover,\nsmelling the gunpowder which had been burnt, actually believed he had\neither committed, or was bent upon murder, and accordingly retreated\ndown-stairs with infinite despatch. All his speed could not convey him\nwithout the reach of Pipes, who, overtaking him in his passage, carried\nhim back into his master's apartment, observing by the way, that\nthis was no time to sheer off, when his consort stood in need of his\nassistance.\n\nThere was something so ruefully severe in the countenance of\nCadwallader, thus compelled, that, at any other time, our hero would\nhave laughed at his concern; but at the present there was nothing\nrisible in his disposition. He had, however, laid aside his pistol, and\nendeavoured, though in vain, to compose his internal disturbance; for\nhe could not utter one syllable to the misanthrope, but stood staring\nat him in silence, with a most delirious aspect. This did not tend\nto dispel the dismay of his friend, who, after some recollection, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nwonder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you have never killed your man before. Pray how\nmay you have disposed of the body?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pickle having recovered the\nfaculty of speech, ordered his lacquey out of the room, and, in a most\nincoherent detail, made Crabtree acquainted with the perfidious conduct\nof the minister.\n\nThe confidant was very glad to find his fears disappointed; for he had\nreally concluded that some life was lost. Perceiving the youth too much\nagitated to be treated by him in his usual style, he owned that Sir\nSteady was a rascal, and encouraged Pickle with the hope of being one\nday able to make reprisals upon him; in the mean time offered him\nmoney for his immediate occasions, exhorted him to exert his own\nqualifications in rendering himself independent of such miscreants, and\nfinally counselled him to represent his wrongs to the nobleman whom he\nhad formerly obliged, with a view of interesting that peer in his behalf\nor at least of obtaining a satisfactory explanation from the minister,\nthat he might take no premature measures of revenge.\n\nThese admonitions were so much milder and more agreeable than our hero\nexpected from the misanthrope, that they had a very favourable effect\nupon his transports, which gradually subsided, until he became so\ntractable as to promise that he would conform to his advice; in\nconsequence of which, he next morning waited upon his lordship, who\nreceived him very politely, as usual, and with great patience heard his\ncomplaint, which, by the bye, he could not repeat without some hasty\nebullitions of passionate resentment. This peer, after having gently\ndisapproved of the letter of expostulation, which had produced such\nunfortunate effects, kindly undertook to recommend his case to the\nminister, and actually performed his promise that same day, when Sir\nSteady informed him, to his utter astonishment, that the poor young\ngentleman was disordered in his brain, so that he could not possibly be\nprovided for in a place of importance, with any regard to the service;\nand it could not be expected that he (Sir Steady) would support his\nextravagance from his own private purse; that he had, indeed at the\nsolicitation of a nobleman deceased, made him a present of three\nhundred pounds, in consideration of some loss that he pretended to have\nsustained in an election; but, since that time, had perceived in him\nsuch indisputable marks of lunacy, both by his distracted letters and\npersonal behaviour, as obliged him to give order that he should not be\nadmitted into the house. To corroborate this assertion, the minister\nactually called in the evidence of his own porter, and one of the\ngentlemen of his household, who had heard the execrations that escaped\nour youth, when he first found himself excluded. In short, the nobleman\nwas convinced that Peregrine was certainly and bona fide mad as a March\nhare; and, by the help of this intimation, began to recollect some\nsymptoms of distraction which appeared in his last visit; he remembered\na certain incoherence in his speech, a violence of gesture and wildness\nof look, that now evidently denoted a disturbed understanding; and he\ndetermined, for his own credit and security, to disentangle himself from\nsuch a dangerous acquaintance.\n\nWith this view, he, in imitation of Sir Steady, commanded his gate to be\nshut against our adventurer; so that, when he went to know the result of\nhis lordship's conference with the minister, the door was flung in his\nface, and the janitor told him through an iron grate, that he needed not\nto give himself the trouble of calling again, for his lord desired to\nbe excused from seeing him. He spoke not a word in answer to this\ndeclaration, which he immediately imputed to the ill offices of the\nminister, against whom he breathed defiance and revenge, in his way to\nthe lodgings of Cadwallader; who, being made acquainted with the manner\nof his reception, begged he would desist from all schemes of vengeance,\nuntil he, Crabtree, should be able to unriddle the mystery of the whole,\nwhich he did not doubt of unveiling by means of his acquaintance with a\nfamily in which his lordship often spent the evening at whist.\n\nIt was not long before he had the desired opportunity: the nobleman\nbeing under no injunctions or obligation to keep the affair secret,\ndiscovered the young gentleman's misfortune, by way of news, to the\nfirst company in which he happened to be; and Peregrine's name was not\nso obscure in the fashionable world, but that his disorder became the\ngeneral topic of conversation for a day; so that his friend soon partook\nof the intelligence, and found means to learn the particulars of the\nminister's information, as above related. Nay, he was in danger of\nbecoming a proselyte to Sir Steady's opinion, when he recalled and\ncompared every circumstance which he knew of Pickle's impatience and\nimpetuosity. Indeed, nothing more easily gains credit than an imputation\nof madness fixed upon any person whatsoever: for when the suspicion of\nthe world is roused, and its observation once set at work, the wisest,\nthe coolest man upon earth, will, by some particulars in his behaviour,\nconvict himself of the charge: every singularity in his dress and manner\n(and such are observable in every person), that before passed unheeded,\nnow rises up in judgment against him, with all the exaggeration of the\nobserver's fancy; and the sagacious examiner perceives distraction in\nevery glance of the eye, turn of the finger, and motion of the head.\nWhen he speaks, there is a strange peculiarity in his argument and\nexpression; when he holds his tongue, his imagination teems with some\nextravagant reverie; his sobriety of demeanour is no other than a lucid\ninterval, and his passion mere delirium.\n\nIf people of the most sedate and insipid life and conversation are\nsubject to such criticisms, no wonder that they should take place upon a\nyouth of Peregrine's fiery disposition, which, on some occasions, would\nhave actually justified any remarks of this kind, which his greatest\nenemies could make. He was accordingly represented as one of those\nenterprising bucks, who, after having spent their fortunes in riot and\nexcess, are happily bereft of their understanding, and consequently\ninsensible of the want and disgrace which they have entailed upon\nthemselves, Cadwallader himself was so much affected with the report,\nthat for some time he hesitated in his deliberations upon our hero,\nbefore he could prevail upon himself to communicate to him the\ninformation he had received, or to treat him in other respects as a\nman of sound intellects. At length, however, he ventured to make Pickle\nacquainted with the particulars he had learned, imparting them with such\ncaution and circumlocution, as he thought necessary to prevent the young\ngentleman from transgressing all bounds of temper and moderation; but,\nfor once, he was agreeably deceived in his prognostic. Incensed as our\nhero was at the conduct of the minister, he could not help laughing at\nthe ridiculous aspersion, which he told his friend he would soon refute\nin a manner that should not be very agreeable to his calumniator,\nobserving, that it was a common practice with the state pilot, thus to\nslander those people to whom he lay under obligations which he had no\nmind to discharge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue it is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Peregrine \u00e2\u0080\u009che has succeeded more\nthan once in contrivances of this kind, having actually reduced divers\npeople of weak heads to such extremity of despair, as hath issued in\ndownright distraction, whereby he was rid of their importunities, and\nhis judgment confirmed at the same time. But I have now, thank Heaven,\nattained to such a pitch of philosophical resolution, as will support me\nagainst all his machinations; and I will forthwith exhibit the\nmonster to the public, in his true lineaments of craft, perfidy, and\ningratitude.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis indeed was the plan with which Mr. Pickle had amused himself during\nthe researches of Crabtree; and by this time it so effectually flattered\nhis imagination, that he believed he should be able to bring his\nadversary, in spite of all his power, to his own terms of submission, by\ndistinguishing himself in the list of those who, at that period, wrote\nagainst the administration. Nor was this scheme so extravagant as it\nmay seem to be, had not he overlooked one material circumstance, which\nCadwallader himself did not recollect, when he approved of this project.\n\nWhile he thus meditated vengeance, the fame of his disorder, in due\ncourse of circulation, reached the ears of that lady of quality whose\nmemoirs have already appeared in these adventures. The correspondence\nwith which she had honoured our hero had been long broke off for the\nreason already advanced, namely, his dread of being exposed to her\ninfatuating charms. He had been candid enough to make her acquainted\nwith the cause of exiling himself from her presence; and she admitted\nthe prudence of self-restraint, although she would have very well\nsatisfied with the continuance of his intimacy and conversation,\nwhich were not at all beneath the desire of any lady in the kingdom.\nNotwithstanding this interruption, she still retained a friendship and\nregard for his character, and felt all the affliction of a humane heart,\nat the news of his misfortunes and deplorable distemper. She had seen\nhim courted and cultivated in the sunshine of his prosperity; but she\nknew, from sad experience, how all those insect-followers shrink away in\nthe winter of distress. Her compassion represented him as a poor unhappy\nlunatic, destitute of all the necessaries of life, dragging about the\nruins of human nature, and exhibiting the spectacle of blasted youth\nto the scorn and abhorrence of his fellow-creatures. Aching with these\ncharitable considerations, she found means to learn in what part of the\ntown he lodged and, laying aside all superfluous ceremony, went in a\nhackney-chair to his door, which was opened by the ever-faithful Pipes.\n\nHer ladyship immediately recollected the features of his trusty\nfollower, whom she could not help loving in her heart for his attachment\nand fidelity, which after she had applauded with a most gracious\ncommendation, she kindly inquired after the state of his master's\nhealth, and asked if he was in a condition to be seen. Tom, who could\nnot suppose that the visit of a fine lady would be unacceptable to a\nyouth of Peregrine's complexion, made no verbal reply to the question;\nbut beckoning her ladyship with an arch significance of feature, at\nwhich she could not forbear smiling, walked softly up-stairs; and she,\nin obedience to the signal, followed her guide into the apartment of our\nhero, whom she found at a writing-table, in the very act of composing\na eulogium upon his good friend Sir Steady. The nature of his work had\nanimated his countenance with an uncommon degree of vivacity; and being\ndressed in a neat deshabille, his figure could not have appeared to more\nadvantage in the eye of a person who despised the tinsel of unnecessary\nornament. She was extremely well pleased to see her expectations so\nagreeably disappointed; for, instead of the squalid circumstances and\nwretched looks attending indigence and distraction, everything was\ndecent and genteel; and the patient's aspect such as betokened internal\nsatisfaction. Hearing the rustling of silk in his room, he lifted up\nhis eyes from the paper, and, seeing her ladyship, was struck\nwith astonishment and awe, as at the unexpected apparition of some\nsupernatural being.\n\nBefore he could recollect himself from his confusion, which called\nthe blood into his cheeks, she told him that, on the strength of old\nacquaintance, she was come to visit him, though it was a long time since\nhe had given her good reason to believe he had absolutely forgot that\nthere was such a person as she in being. After having made the most warm\nacknowledgments for this unforeseen honour, he assured her ladyship that\nthe subject of her reproach was not his fault, but rather his very\ngreat misfortune; and that, if it had been in his power to forget her so\neasily as she seemed to imagine, he should never have given her cause to\ntax him with want of duty and respect.\n\nStill dubious of his situation, she began to converse with him\non different subjects; and he acquitted himself so well in every\nparticular, that she no longer doubted his having been misrepresented by\nthe malice of his enemies, and candidly told him the cause and intent\nof her coming. He was not deficient in expressions of gratitude for this\ninstance of her generosity and friendship, which even drew tears from\nhis eyes. As to the imputation of madness, he explained it so much to\nher ladyship's satisfaction, that she evidently perceived he had been\nbarbarously dealt with, and that the charge was no other than a most\nvillainous aspersion. Notwithstanding all his endeavours to conceal\nthe true state of his finances, it was impossible for him to give this\ndetail, without disclosing some of the difficulties under which he\nlaboured; and, her ladyship's sagacity divining the rest, she not only\nmade him a tender of assistance, but, presenting a bank-note for a\nconsiderable sum, insisted upon his acceptance of it as a trifling mark\nof her esteem, and a specimen of what she was inclined to do in his\nbehalf. But this mark of her benevolence he would by no means receive;\nassuring her, that, though his affairs were at present a little\nperplexed, he had never felt the least circumstance of distress,\nand begging that she would not subject him to the burden of such an\nunnecessary obligation.\n\nBeing obliged to put up with this refusal she protested she would never\nforgive him should she ever hear that he rejected her offer when he\nstood in need of her aid; or if, in any time to come, he should not\napply to her friendship, if ever he should find himself incommoded in\npoint of fortune. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn overdelicacy in this respect,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall\nlook upon as a disapprobation of my own conduct; because I myself have\nbeen obliged to have recourse to my friends in such emergencies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These\ngenerous remonstrances and marks of particular friendship could not\nfail to make a deep impression upon the heart of our hero, which still\nsmarted from the former impulse of her charms; he not only felt all\nthose transports which a man of honour and sensibility may be supposed\nto feel upon such an occasion, but the sentiments of a more tender\npassion awaking in his breast, he could not help expressing himself in\nterms adapted to the emotion of his soul; and, at length, plainly told\nher, that, were he disposed to be a beggar, he would ask something of\ninfinitely more importance to his peace than the charitable assistance\nshe had proffered. Her ladyship had too much penetration to mistake his\nmeaning; but, as she did not choose to encourage his advances, pretended\nto interpret his intimation into a general compliment of gallantry, and,\nin a jocose manner, desired he would not give her any reason to believe\nhis lucid interval was past. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn faith, my lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI perceive\nthe fit coming on; and I don't see why I may not use the privilege of\nmy distemper, so far as to declare myself one of your most passionate\nadmirers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied her ladyship, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall not be fool\nenough to believe a madman, unless I were assured that your disorder\nproceeded from your love; and that this was the case, I suppose you will\nfind it difficult to prove.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the youth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have in\nthis drawer what will convince you of my having been mad on that strain;\nand, since you doubt my pretension, you must give me leave to produce\nmy testimonials.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he opened an escrutoire, and taking out a\npaper, presented her with the following song, which he had written\nin her praise, immediately after he was made acquainted with the\nparticulars of her story:\n\n                       I.\n     While with fond rapture and amaze,\n     On thy transcendent charms I gaze,\n     My cautious soul essays in vain\n     Her peace and freedom to maintain;\n     yet let that blooming form divine,\n     Where grace and harmony combine;\n     Those eyes, like genial orbs that move,\n     Dispensing gladness, joy, and love;\n     in all their pomp assail my view,\n     Intent my bosom to subdue;\n     My breast, by wary maxims steel'd,\n     Not all those charms shall force to yield.\n\n                       II.\n     But, when invok'd to Beauty's aid,\n     I see the enlighten'd soul display'd,\n     That soul so sensibly sedate\n     Amid the storms of froward fate!\n     Thy genius active, strong, and clear,\n     Thy wit sublime, though not severe,\n     The social ardour, void of art,\n     That glows within thy candid heart;\n     My spirits, sense, and strength decay,\n     My resolution dies away,\n     And, every faculty oppress'd,\n     Almighty love invades my breast!\n\nHer ladyship having perused this production, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWere I inclined to\nbe suspicious,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should believe that I had no share in\nproducing this composition, which seems to have been inspired by a much\nmore amiable object. However, I will take your word for your intention,\nand thank you for the unmerited compliment, though I have met with it\nin such an accidental manner. Nevertheless, I must be so free as to tell\nyou, it is now high time for you to contract that unbounded spirit of\ngallantry, which you have indulged so long, into a sincere attachment\nfor the fair Emilia, who, by all accounts, deserves the whole of your\nattention and regard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His nerves thrilled at mention of that name,\nwhich he never heard pronounced without agitation. Rather than undergo\nthe consequence of a conversation upon this subject, he chose to drop\nthe theme of love altogether, and industriously introduced some other\ntopic of discourse.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCVII.\n\n\n\nHe writes against the Minister, by whose Instigation he is arrested, and\nmoves himself by habeas corpus into the Fleet.\n\n\nMy lady having prolonged her stay beyond the period of a common visit,\nand repeated her protestations in the most frank and obliging manner,\ntook her leave of our adventurer, who promised to pay his respects to\nher in a few days at her own house. Meanwhile, he resumed his task; and\nhaving finished a most severe remonstrance against Sir Steady, not\nonly with regard to his private ingratitude, but also to his\nmaladministration of public affairs, he sent it to the author of a\nweekly paper, who had been long a professed reformer in politics, and it\nappeared in a very few days, with a note of the publisher, desiring the\nfavour of further correspondence with the author.\n\nThe animadversions contained in this small essay were so spirited and\njudicious, and a great many new lights thrown upon the subject with such\nperspicuity, as attracted the notice of the public in an extraordinary\nmanner, and helped to raise the character of the paper in which it was\ninserted. The minister was not the last who examined the performance,\nwhich, in spite of all his boasted temper, provoked him to such a\ndegree, that he set his emissaries at work, and by dint of corruption,\nprocured a sight of the manuscript in Peregrine's own handwriting, which\nhe immediately recognised; but, for further confirmation of his opinion,\nhe compared it with the two letters which he had received from our\nadventurer. Had he known the young gentleman's talents for declamation\nwere so acute, perhaps he would never have given him cause to complain,\nbut employed him in the vindication of his own measures; nay, he might\nstill have treated him like some other authors whom he had brought over\nfrom the opposition, had not the keenness of this first assault\nincensed him to a desire of revenge. He, therefore, no sooner made\nthis discovery, than he conveyed his directions to his dependent, the\nreceiver-general, who was possessed of Pickle's notes. Next day, while\nour author stood within a circle of his acquaintance, at a certain\ncoffee-house, holding forth with great eloquence upon the diseases of\nthe state, he was accosted by a bailiff, who, entering the room with\nfive or six followers, told him aloud that he had a writ against him for\ntwelve hundred pounds, at the suit of Mr. Ravage Gleanum.\n\nThe whole company were astonished at this address, which did not fail to\ndiscompose the defendant himself, who, as it were instinctively, in the\nmidst of his confusion, saluted the officer across the head with\nhis cane; in consequence of which application, he was surrounded and\ndisarmed in an instant by the gang, who carried him off to the next\ntavern in the most opprobrious manner. Nor did one of the spectators\ninterpose in his behalf, or visit him in his confinement with the\nleast tender of advice or assistance; such is the zeal of coffee-house\nfriendship. This stroke was the more severe upon our hero, as it was\naltogether unexpected; for he had utterly forgot the debt for which\nhe was arrested. His present indignation was, however, chiefly kindled\nagainst the bailiff, who had done his office in such a disrespectful\nmanner; and the first use he made of his recollection in the house to\nwhich they conducted him, was to chastise him for the insolence and\nindecency of his behaviour. This task he performed with his bare fists,\nevery other weapon being previously conveyed out of his reach; and\nthe delinquent underwent his discipline with surprising patience and\nresignation, asking pardon with great humility, and protesting before\nGod, that he had never willingly and wittingly used any gentleman with\nill manners, but had been commanded to arrest our adventurer according\nto the express direction of the creditor, on pain of forfeiting his\nplace.\n\nBy this declaration Peregrine was appeased, and, out of a delirium of\npassion, waked to all the horrors of reflection. All the glory of his\nyouth was now eclipsed, all the blossoms of his hope were blasted,\nand he saw himself doomed to the miseries of a jail, without the least\nprospect of enlargement, except in the issue of his lawsuit, of which he\nhad, for some time past, grown less and less confident every day. What\nwould become of the unfortunate, if the constitution of the mind did\nnot permit them to bring one passion into the field against another?\npassions that operate in the human breast, like poisons of a different\nnature, extinguishing each other's effect. Our hero's grief reigned in\nfull despotism, until it was deposed by revenge, during the predominancy\nof which he considered everything which had happened as a circumstance\nconducive to its gratification. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I must be prisoner for life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nhe to himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I must relinquish all my gay expectations, let me at\nleast have the satisfaction of clanking my chains so as to interrupt\nthe repose of my adversary; and let me search in my own breast for that\npeace and contentment, which I have not been able to find in all the\nscenes of my success. In being detached from the world, I shall be\ndelivered from folly and ingratitude, as well as exempted from\nan expense, which I should have found it very difficult, if not\nimpracticable, to support; I shall have little or no temptation\nto misspend my time, and more undisturbed opportunity to earn my\nsubsistence, and prosecute revenge. After all, a jail is the best tub to\nwhich a cynic philosopher can retire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn consequence of these comfortable reflections, he sent a letter to Mr.\nCrabtree, with an account of his misfortune, signifying his resolution\nto move himself immediately into the Fleet, and desiring that he would\nsend him some understanding attorney of his acquaintance, who would\ndirect him into the steps necessary to be taken for that purpose. The\nmisanthrope, upon the receipt of this intimation, sent in person to a\nlawyer, whom he accompanied to the spunging-house whither the prisoner\nhad by this time retired. Peregrine was, under the auspices of his\ndirector, conducted to the judges' chamber, where he was left in the\ncustody of a tipstaff; and, after having paid for a warrant of habeas\ncorpus, by him conveyed to the Fleet, and delivered to the care of the\nwarden.\n\nHere he was introduced to the lodge, in which he was obliged to\nexpose himself a full half-hour to the eyes of all the turnkeys and\ndoor-keepers, who took an accurate survey of his person, that they might\nknow him again at first sight; and then he was turned loose into the\nplace called the master's side, having given a valuable consideration\nfor that privilege. This is a large range of building, containing some\nhundreds of lodging-rooms for the convenience of the prisoners, who pay\nso much per week for that accommodation. In short, this community is\nlike a city detached from all communication with the neighbouring parts,\nregulated by its own laws, and furnished with peculiar conveniences for\nthe use of the inhabitants. There is a coffee-house for the resort of\ngentlemen, in which all sorts of liquors are kept, and a public kitchen,\nwhere any quantity of meat is sold at a very reasonable rate, or any\nkind of provision boiled and roasted gratis, for the poor prisoners.\nNay, there are certain servants of the public, who are obliged to go to\nmarket, at the pleasure of individuals, without fee or reward from those\nwho employ them. Nor are they cooped up, so as to be excluded from\nthe benefit of fresh air, there being an open area, of a considerable\nextent, adjacent to the building, on which they may exercise themselves\nin walking, skittles, bowls, and a variety of other diversions,\naccording to the inclination of each.\n\nOur adventurer being admitted a denizen of this community, found himself\nbewildered in the midst of strangers, who, by their appearance, did not\nat all prepossess him in their favour; and, after having strolled about\nthe place with his friend Cadwallader, repaired to the coffee-house,\nin order to be further informed of the peculiar customs which it was\nnecessary for him to know. There, while he endeavoured to pick up\nintelligence from the bar-keeper, he was accosted by a person in\ncanonicals, who very civilly asked if he was a new-comer. Being answered\nin the affirmative, he gave him the salutation of welcome to the\nsociety, and, with great hospitality, undertook to initiate him in the\nconstitutions of the brotherhood. This humane clergyman gave him to\nunderstand, that his first care ought to be that of securing a lodging;\ntelling him there was a certain number of apartments in the prison let\nat the same price, though some were more commodious than others;\nand that when the better sort became vacant, by the removal of their\npossessors, those who succeeded in point of seniority had the privilege\nof occupying the empty tenements preferable to the rest of the\ninhabitants, howsoever respectable they might otherwise be. That, when\nthe jail was very much crowded, there was but one chamber allotted for\ntwo lodgers; but this was not considered as any great hardship on the\nprisoners; because, in that case, there was always a sufficient number\nof males, who willingly admitted the females to a share in their\napartments and beds. Not but the time had been, when this expedient\nwould not answer the occasion; because, after a couple had been\nquartered in every room, there was a considerable residue still\nunprovided with lodging; so that, for the time being, the last-comers\nwere obliged to take up their habitation in Mount Scoundrel, an\napartment most miserably furnished, in which they lay promiscuously,\namidst filth and vermin, until they could be better accommodated in due\ncourse of rotation.\n\nPeregrine, hearing the description of this place, began to be very\nimpatient about his night's lodging; and the parson, perceiving his\nanxiety, conducted him, without loss of time, to the warden, who\nforthwith put him in possession of a paltry chamber, for which he agreed\nto pay half a crown a week. This point being settled, his director gave\nhim an account of the different methods of eating, either singly, in a\nmess, or at an ordinary, and advised him to choose the last, as the most\nreputable, offering to introduce him next day to the best company in the\nFleet, who always dined together in public.\n\nPickle having thanked this gentleman for his civilities, and promised\nto be governed by his advice, invited him to pass the evening at his\napartment; and, in the meantime, shut himself up with Crabtree, in order\nto deliberate upon the wreck of his affairs. Of all his ample fortune\nnothing now remained but his wardrobe, which was not very sumptuous,\nabout thirty guineas in cash, and the garrison, which the misanthrope\ncounselled him to convert into ready money for his present subsistence.\nThis advice, however, he absolutely rejected, not only on account of his\nhaving already bestowed it upon Hatchway during the term of his natural\nlife, but also with a view of retaining some memorial of the commodore's\ngenerosity. He proposed, therefore, to finish in this retreat the\ntranslation which he had undertaken, and earn his future subsistence by\nlabour of the same kind. He desired Cadwallader to take charge of his\nmovables, and send to him such linen and clothes as he should have\noccasion for in his confinement. But, among all his difficulties,\nnothing embarrassed him so much as his faithful Pipes, whom he could no\nlonger entertain in his service. He knew Tom had made shift to pick up\na competency in the course of his ministration; but that reflection,\nthough it in some measure alleviated, could not wholly prevent the\nmortification he should suffer in parting with an affectionate adherent,\nwho was by this time become as necessary to him as one of his own\nmembers, and who was so accustomed to live under his command and\nprotection, that he did not believe the fellow could reconcile himself\nto any other way of life.\n\nCrabtree, in order to make him easy on that score, offered to adopt him\nin the room of his own valet, whom he would dismiss; though he observed,\nthat Pipes had been quite spoiled in our hero's service. But Peregrine\ndid not choose to lay his friend under that inconvenience, knowing that\nhis present lacquey understood and complied with all the peculiarities\nof his humour, which Pipes would never be able to study or regard; he\ntherefore determined to send him back to his shipmate Hatchway,\nwith whom he had spent the fore part of his life. These points being\nadjusted, the two friends adjourned to the coffee-house, with a view of\ninquiring into the character of the clergyman to whose beneficence our\nadventurer was so much indebted. They learned he was a person who had\nincurred the displeasure of the bishop in whose diocese he was settled,\nand, being unequal in power to his antagonist, had been driven to the\nFleet, in consequence of his obstinate opposition; though he still\nfound means to enjoy a pretty considerable income, by certain irregular\npractices in the way of his function, which income was chiefly consumed\nin acts of humanity to his fellow-creatures in distress.\n\nHis eulogium was scarce finished, when he entered the room, according to\nappointment with Peregrine, who ordering wine and something for supper\nto be carried to his apartment, the triumvirate went thither; and\nCadwallader taking his leave for the night, the two fellow-prisoners\npassed the evening very sociably, our hero being entertained by his new\ncompanion with a private history of the place, some particulars of which\nwere extremely curious. He told him, that the person who attended them\nat supper, bowing with the most abject servility, and worshipping them\nevery time he opened his mouth, with the epithets of your lordship and\nyour honour, had, a few years before, been actually a captain in\nthe guards; who, after having run his career in the great world, had\nthreaded every station in their community, from that of a buck of\nthe first order, who swaggers about the Fleet in a laced coat, with a\nfootman and w--, to the degree of a tapster, in which he was now\nhappily settled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you will take the trouble of going into the cook's\nkitchen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou will perceive a beau metamorphosed into a\nturnspit; and there are some hewers of wood and drawers of water in\nthis microcosm who have had forests and fishponds of their own. Yet,\nnotwithstanding such a miserable reverse of fortune, they are neither\nobjects of regard nor compassion, because their misfortunes are the\nfruits of the most vicious extravagance, and they are absolutely\ninsensible of the misery which is their lot. Those of our\nfellow-sufferers, who have been reduced by undeserved losses, or the\nprecipitation of inexperienced youth, never fail to meet with the most\nbrotherly assistance, provided they behave with decorum, and a due\nsense of their unhappy circumstances. Nor are we destitute of power to\nchastise the licentious, who refuse to comply with the regulations\nof the place, and disturb the peace of the community with riot and\ndisorder. Justice is here impartially administered by a court of equity,\nconsisting of a select number of the most respectable inhabitants, who\npunish all offenders with equal judgment and resolution, after they have\nbeen fairly convicted of the crimes laid to their charge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe clergyman having thus explained the economy of the place, as well as\nthe cause of his own confinement, began to discover signs of curiosity\ntouching our hero's situation; and Pickle, thinking he could do no less\nfor the satisfaction of a man who had treated him in such a hospitable\nmanner, favoured him with a detail of the circumstances which produced\nhis imprisonment; at the same time gratifying his resentment against\nthe minister, which delighted in recapitulating the injuries he had\nreceived. The parson, who had been prepossessed in favour of our youth\nat first sight, understanding what a considerable part he had acted on\nthe stage of life, felt his veneration increase; and, pleased with the\nopportunity of introducing a stranger of his consequence to the club,\nleft him to his repose, or rather to ruminate on an event which he had\nnot as yet seriously considered.\n\nI might here, in imitation of some celebrated writers, furnish out a\npage or two, with the reflections he made upon the instability of human\naffairs, the treachery of the world, and the temerity of youth; and\nendeavour to decoy the reader into a smile, by some quaint observation\nof my own, touching the sagacious moraliser: but, besides that I look\nupon this practice as an impertinent anticipation of the peruser's\nthoughts, I have too much matter of importance upon my hands, to give\nthe reader the least reason to believe that I am driven to such paltry\nshifts, in order to eke out the volume. Suffice it then to say,\nour adventurer passed a very uneasy night, not only from the thorny\nsuggestions of his mind, but likewise from the anguish of his body,\nwhich suffered from the hardness of his couch, as well as from the\nnatural inhabitants thereof, that did not tamely suffer his intrusion.\nIn the morning he was waked by Pipes, who brought upon his shoulder\na portmanteau filled with necessaries, according to the direction of\nCadwallader; and, tossing it down upon the floor, regaled himself with a\nquid, without the least manifestation of concern. After some pause, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\nsee, Pipes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his master, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto what I have brought myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cEy, ey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n answered the valet, \u00e2\u0080\u009conce the vessel is ashore, what signifies talking?\nWe must bear a hand to tow her off, if we can. If she won't budge for\nall the anchors and capstans aboard, after we have lightened her, by\ncutting away her masts, and heaving our guns and cargo overboard, why\nthen, mayhap a brisk gale of wind, a tide, or current setting from\nshore, may float her again in the blast of a whistle. Here is two\nhundred and ten guineas by the tale in this here canvas bag; and upon\nthis scrap of paper--no, avast--that's my discharge from the parish\nfor Moll Trundle--ey, here it is--an order for thirty pounds upon the\nwhat-d'ye-call-'em in the city; and two tickets for twenty-five and\neighteen, which I lent, d'ye see, to Sam Studding to buy a cargo of\nrum, when he hoisted the sign of the commodore at St. Catherine's.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So\nsaying, he spread his whole stock upon the table for the acceptance of\nPeregrine; who, being very much affected with this fresh instance of his\nattachment, expressed his satisfaction at seeing he had been such a good\neconomist, and paid his wages up to that very day. He thanked him for\nhis faithful services, and, observing that he himself was no longer in a\ncondition to maintain a domestic, advised him to retire to the garrison,\nwhere he would be kindly received by his friend Hatchway, to whom he\nwould recommend him in the strongest terms.\n\nPipes looked blank at this unexpected intimation, to which he replied,\nthat he wanted neither pay nor provision, but only to be employed as a\ntender; and that he would not steer his course for the garrison,\nunless his master would first take his lumber aboard. Pickle, however,\nperemptorily refused to touch a farthing of the money, which he\ncommanded him to put up, and Pipes was so mortified at his refusal,\nthat, twisting the notes together, he threw them into the fire without\nhesitation, crying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cD-- the money!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The canvas bag with its contents\nwould have shared the same fate, had not Peregrine started up, and\nsnatching the paper from the flames, ordered his valet to forbear, on\npain of being banished for ever from his sight. He told him that, for\nthe present, there was a necessity for his being dismissed, and he\ndischarged him accordingly; but, if he would go and live quietly\nwith the lieutenant, he promised, on the first favourable turn of his\nfortune, to take him again into his service. In the meantime he gave him\nto understand, that he neither wanted, nor would make use of his money,\nwhich he insisted upon his pocketing immediately, on pain of forfeiting\nall title to his favour.\n\nPipes was very much chagrined at these injunctions, to which he made\nno reply; but, sweeping the money into his bag, stalked off in silence,\nwith a look of grief and mortification, which his countenance had never\nexhibited before. Nor was the proud heart of Pickle unmoved upon the\noccasion; he could scarce suppress his sorrow in the presence of Pipes,\nand, soon as he was gone, it vented itself in tears.\n\nHaving no great pleasure in conversing with his own thoughts, he dressed\nhimself with all convenient despatch, being attended by one of the\noccasional valets of the place, who had formerly been a rich mercer in\nthe city; and, this operation being performed, he went to breakfast\nat the coffee-house, where he happened to meet with his friend the\nclergyman and several persons of genteel appearance, to whom the doctor\nintroduced him as a new messmate. By these gentlemen he was conducted to\na place where they spent the forenoon in playing at fives, an exercise\nin which our hero took singular delight; and about one o'clock a court\nwas held, for the trial of two delinquents, who had transgressed the\nlaws of honesty and good order. The first who appeared at the bar was\nan attorney, accused of having picked a gentleman's pocket of his\nhandkerchief. And the fact being proved by incontestable evidence, he\nreceived sentence. In consequence of which, he was immediately carried\nto the public pump, and subjected to a severe cascade of cold water.\nThis cause being discussed, they proceeded to the trial of the other\noffender, who was a lieutenant of a man-of-war, indicted for a riot,\nwhich he had committed in company with a female, not yet taken, against\nthe laws of the place, and the peace of his fellow-prisoners. The\nculprit had been very obstreperous, and absolutely refused to obey the\nsummons, with many expressions of contempt and defiance against the\nauthority of the court; upon which the constables were ordered to bring\nhim to the bar, vi et armis; and he was accordingly brought before the\njudge, after having made a most desperate resistance with a hanger, by\nwhich one of the officers was dangerously wounded. This outrage was such\nan aggravation of his crime, that the court would not venture to decide\nupon it, but remitted him to the sentence of the warden; who, by virtue\nof his dictatorial power, ordered the rioter to be loaded with irons,\nand confined in the strong room, which is a dismal dungeon, situated\nupon the side of the ditch, infested with toads and vermin, surcharged\nwith noisome damps, and impervious to the least ray of light.\n\nJustice being done upon these criminals, our adventurer and his company\nadjourned to the ordinary, which was kept at the coffee-house; and he\nfound, upon inquiry, that his messmates consisted of one officer, two\nunderwriters, three projectors, an alchemist, an attorney, a parson, a\nbrace of poets, a baronet, and a knight of the Bath. The dinner,\nthough not sumptuous, nor very elegantly served up, was nevertheless\nsubstantial, and pretty well dressed. The wine was tolerable, and all\nthe guests as cheerful as if they had been utter strangers to calamity;\nso that our adventurer began to relish the company, and mix in the\nconversation, with that sprightliness and ease which were peculiar to\nhis disposition. The repast being ended, the reckoning paid, and part\nof the gentlemen withdrawn to cards, or other avocations, those who\nremained, among whom Peregrine made one, agreed to spend the afternoon\nin conversation over a bowl of punch; and the liquor being produced,\nthey passed the time very socially in various topics of discourse,\nincluding many curious anecdotes relating to their own affairs. No man\nscrupled to own the nature of the debt for which he was confined, unless\nit happened to be some piddling affair, but, on the contrary, boasted\nof the importance of the sum, as a circumstance that implied his\nhaving been a person of consequence in life; and he who made the most\nremarkable escapes from bailiffs, was looked upon as a man of superior\ngenius and address.\n\nAmong other extraordinary adventures of this kind, none was more\nromantic than the last elopement achieved by the officer; who told them\nhe had been arrested for a debt of two hundred pounds, at a time when he\ncould not command as many pence, and conveyed to the bailiff's house,\nin which he continued a whole fortnight, moving his lodgings higher and\nhigher, from time to time, in proportion to the decay of his credit;\nuntil, from the parlour, he had made a regular ascent to the garret.\nThere, while he ruminated on his next step, which would have been to the\nMarshalsea, and saw the night come on, attended with hunger and cold,\nthe wind began to blow, and the tiles of the house rattled with the\nstorm. His imagination was immediately struck with the idea of escaping\nunperceived, amidst the darkness and noise of the tempest, by creeping\nout of the window of his apartment, and making his way over the tops\nof the adjoining houses. Glowing with this prospect, he examined the\npassage, which, to his infinite mortification, he found grated with iron\nbars on the outside; but even this difficulty did not divert him from\nhis purpose. Conscious of his own strength, he believed himself able to\nmake a hole through the roof, which seemed to be slender and crazy; and,\non this supposition, he barricaded the door with the whole furniture of\nthe room; then setting himself to work with a poker, he in a few minutes\neffected a passage for his hand, with which he gradually stripped off\nthe boards and tiling, so as to open a sallyport for his whole body,\nthrough which he fairly set himself free, groping his way towards the\nnext tenement. Here, however, he met with an unlucky accident. His hat\nbeing blown off his head, chanced to fall into the court just as one\nof the bailiff's followers was knocking at the door; and this myrmidon,\nrecognizing it, immediately gave the alarm to his chief, who,\nrunning up-stairs to the garret, forced open the door in a twinkling,\nnotwithstanding the precautions which the prisoner had taken, and, with\nhis attendant, pursued the fugitive through his own track. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter this\nchase had continued some time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the officer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto the imminent\ndanger of all three, I found my progress suddenly stopped by a skylight,\nthrough which I perceived seven tailors sitting at work upon a board.\nWithout the least hesitation, or previous notice, I plunged among them\nwith my backside foremost. Before they could recollect themselves from\nthe consternation occasioned by such a strange visit, I told them my\nsituation, and gave them to understand that there was no time to be\nlost. One of the number, taking the hint, led me instantly down-stairs,\nand dismissed me at the street door; while the bailiff and his follower,\narriving at the breach, were deterred from entering by the brethren of\nmy deliverer, who, presenting their shears, like a range of chevaux de\nfrise, commanded them to retire, on pain of immediate death. And the\ncatchpole, rather than risk his carcase, consented to discharge the\ndebt, comforting himself with the hope of making me prisoner again.\nThere, however, he was disappointed. I kept snug, and laughed at his\nescape-warrant, until I was ordered abroad with the regiment, when I\nconveyed myself in a hearse to Gravesend, where I embarked for Flanders;\nbut, being obliged to come over again on the recruiting service, I was\nnabbed on another score. And all the satisfaction my first captor has\nbeen able to obtain, is a writ of detainer, which, I believe, will fix\nme in this place, until the parliament, in its great goodness, shall\nthink proper to discharge my debts by a new act of insolvency.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEverybody owned, that the captain's success was equal to the hardiness\nof his enterprise, which was altogether in the style of a soldier; but\none of the merchants observed, that he must have been a bailiff of small\nexperience, who would trust a prisoner of that consequence in such an\nunguarded place. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the captain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009chad fallen into the hands\nof such a cunning rascal as the fellow that arrested me, he would not\nhave found it such an easy matter to escape; for the manner in which I\nwas caught is perhaps the most extraordinary that ever was practised\nin these realms. You must know, gentlemen, I suffered such losses by\ninsuring vessels during the war, that I was obliged to stop payment,\nthough my expectations were such as encouraged me to manage one\nbranch of business, without coming to an immediate composition with my\ncreditors, and, in short, I received consignments from abroad as usual,\nthat I might not be subject to the visits of those catchpoles, I never\nstirred abroad; but, turning my first floor into a warehouse, ordered\nall my goods to be hoisted up by a crane fixed to the upper story of my\nhouse. Divers were the stratagems practised by those ingenious ferrets,\nwith a view of decoying me from the walls of my fortification. I\nreceived innumerable messages from people, who wanted to see me at\ncertain taverns, upon particular business. I was summoned into the\ncountry, to see my own mother, who was said to be at the point of\ndeath. A gentlewoman, one night, was taken in labour on my threshold. At\nanother time I was disturbed with the cry of murder in the street; and\nonce I was alarmed by a false fire. But, being still upon my guard, I\nbaffled all their attempts, and thought myself quite secure from their\ninvention, when one of those bloodhounds, inspired, I believe, by the\ndevil himself, contrived a snare by which I was at last entrapped. He\nmade it his business to inquire into the particulars of my traffic; and,\nunderstanding that, among other things, there were several chests of\nFlorence entered at the custom house on my behalf, he ordered himself\nto be enclosed in a box of the same dimensions, with air-holes in the\nbottom, for the benefit of breathing, and marked upon the cover; and,\nbeing conveyed to my door in a cart, among other goods, was, in his\nturn, hoisted up to my warehouse, where I stood with a hammer, in order\nto open the chests, that I might compare the contents with the invoice.\nYou may guess my surprise and consternation, when, upon uncovering the\nbox, I saw a bailiff rearing up his head, like Lazarus from the grave,\nand heard him declare that he had a writ against me for a thousand\npounds. Indeed, I aimed the hammer at his head, but, in the hurry of my\nconfusion, missed my mark; before I could repeat the blow, he started\nup with great agility, and executed his office in sight of several\nevidences whom he had assembled in the street for that purpose; so that\nI could not possibly disentangle myself from the toil without incurring\nan escape-warrant, from which I had no protection. But, had I known\nthe contents of the chest, by all that's good! I would have ordered my\nporter to raise it up as high as the crane would permit, and then have\ncut the rope by accident.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat expedient,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the knight with the red ribbon, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould have\ndiscouraged him from such hazardous attempts for the future, and would\nhave been an example in terrorem of all his brethren. The story puts me\nin mind of a deliverance achieved by Tom Hackabout, a very stout, honest\nfellow, an old acquaintance of mine, who had been so famous for\nmaiming bailiffs, that another gentleman having been ill-used at a\nspunging-house, no sooner obtained his liberty, than, with a view of\nbeing revenged upon the landlord, he, for five shillings, bought one of\nTom's notes, which sold at a very large discount, and, taking out a writ\nupon it, put it into the hands of the bailiff who had used him ill. The\ncatchpole, after a diligent search, had an opportunity of executing the\nwrit upon the defendant, who, without ceremony, broke one of his arms,\nfractured his skull, and belaboured him in such a manner, that he lay\nwithout sense or motion on the spot. By such exploits, this hero became\nso formidable, that no single bailiff would undertake to arrest him;\nso that he appeared in all public places untouched. At length, however,\nseveral officers of the Marshalsea court entered into a confederacy\nagainst him; and two of the number, attended by three desperate\nfollowers, ventured to arrest him one day in the Strand, near\nHungerford-market. He found it impossible to make resistance, because\nthe whole gang sprung upon him at once, like so many tigers, and\npinioned his arms so fast, that he could not wag a finger. Perceiving\nhimself fairly overpowered, he desired to be conducted forthwith to\njail, and was stowed in a boat accordingly; by the time they had\nreached the middle of the river, he found means to overset the wherry\nby accident, and every man, disregarding the prisoner, consulted his own\nsafety. As for Hackabout, to whom that element was quite familiar, he\nmounted astride upon the keel of the boat, which was uppermost, and\nexhorted the bailiffs to swim for their lives; protesting before God,\nthat they had no other chance to be saved.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe watermen were immediately taken up by some of their own friends,\nwho, far from yielding any assistance to the catchpoles, kept aloof, and\nexulted in their calamity. In short, two of the five went to the bottom,\nand never saw the light of God's sun, and the other three, with\ngreat difficulty, saved themselves by laying hold on the rudder of a\ndung-barge, to which they were carried by the stream, while Tom,\nwith great deliberation, swam across to the Surrey shore. After this\nachievement, he was so much dreaded by the whole fraternity, that they\nshivered at the very mention of his name; and this character, which\nsome people would think an advantage to a man in debt, was the greatest\nmisfortune that could possibly happen to him; because no tradesman would\ngive him credit for the least trifle, on the supposition that he could\nnot indemnify himself in the common course of law.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe parson did not approve of Mr. Hackabout's method of escaping,\nwhich he considered as a very unchristian attempt upon the lives of his\nfellow-subjects. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat we elude the laws of our\ncountry, without murdering the officers of justice. For my own part, I\ncan lay my hand upon my heart, and safely say, that I forgive from\nmy soul the fellow by whom I was made a prisoner, although the\ncircumstances of his behaviour were treacherous, wicked, and profane.\nYou must know, Mr. Pickle, I was one day called into my chapel, in order\nto join a couple in the holy bands of matrimony; and, my affairs being\nat that time so situated, as to lay me under apprehensions of an arrest,\nI cautiously surveyed the man through a lattice which was made for that\npurpose, before I would venture to come within his reach. He was clothed\nin a seaman's jacket and trousers, and had such an air of simplicity in\nhis countenance, as divested me of all suspicion. I therefore, without\nfurther scruple, trusted myself in his presence, began to exercise\nthe duty of my function, and had actually performed one half of the\nceremony, when the supposed woman, pulling out a paper from her bosom,\nexclaimed, with a masculine voice, 'Sir, you are my prisoner; I have got\na writ against you for five hundred pounds.' I was thunderstruck at this\ndeclaration, not so much on account of my own misfortune, which, thank\nHeaven, I can bear with patience and resignation, as at the impiety of\nthe wretch, first, in disguising such a worldly aim under the cloak of\nreligion; and, secondly, in prostituting the service, when there was no\noccasion for so doing, his design having previously taken effect. Yet I\nforgive him, poor soul! because he knew not what he did; and I hope you,\nSir Simple, will exert the same Christian virtue towards the man by whom\nyou were likewise overreached.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! d-- the rascal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the knight; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwere I his judge, he should\nbe condemned to flames everlasting. A villain! to disgrace me in such\na manner, before almost all the fashionable company in town.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Our hero\nexpressing a curiosity to know the particulars of this adventure, the\nknight gratified his desire, by telling him, that one evening, while\nhe was engaged in a party of cards, at a drum in the house of a certain\nlady of quality, he was given to understand by one of the servants, that\na stranger, very richly dressed, was just arrived in a chair, preceded\nby five footmen with flambeaux, and that he refused to come upstairs,\nuntil he should be introduced by Sir Simple. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon this notice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n continued the knight, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI judged it was some of my quality friends; and,\nhaving obtained her ladyship's permission to bring him up, went down to\nthe hall, and perceived a person, whom, to the best of my recollection,\nI had never seen before. However, his appearance was so magnificent,\nthat I could not harbour the least suspicion of his true quality; and,\nseeing me advance, he saluted me with a very genteel bow, observing,\nthat though he had not the honour of my acquaintance, he could not\ndispense with waiting upon me, even on that occasion, in consequence of\na letter which he had received from a particular friend. So saying, he\nput a paper into my hand, intimating that he had got a writ against\nme for ten thousand pounds, and that it would be my interest to submit\nwithout resistance, for he was provided with a guard of twenty men,\nwho surrounded the door in different disguises, determined to secure me\nagainst all opposition. Enraged at the scoundrel's finesse, and trusting\nto the assistance of the real footmen assembled in the hall, 'So you are\na rascally bailiff,' said I, 'who have assumed the garb of a gentleman,\nin order to disturb her ladyship's company. Take this fellow, my lads,\nand roll him in the kennel. Here are ten guineas for your trouble.'\nThese words were no sooner pronounced, than I was seized, lifted up,\nplaced in a chair, and carried off in the twinkling of an eye; not but\nthat the servants of the house, and some other footmen, made a motion\ntowards my rescue, and alarmed all the company above. But the bailiff\naffirming with undaunted effrontery, that I was taken up upon an affair\nof state, and so many people appearing in his behalf, the countess would\nnot suffer the supposed messenger to be insulted; and he carried me to\nthe county jail without further let or molestation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCVIII.\n\n\n\nPickle seems tolerably well reconciled to his Cage; and is by the\nClergyman entertained with the Memoirs of a Noted Personage, whom he\nsees by accident in the Fleet.\n\n\nThe knight had scarce finished his narrative, when our hero was told,\nthat a gentleman in the coffee-room wanted to see him; and when he\nwent thither, he found his friend Crabtree, who had transacted all his\naffairs, according to the determination of the preceding day; and now\ngave him an account of the remarks he overheard, on the subject of\nhis misfortune; for the manner of the arrest was so public and\nextraordinary, that those who were present immediately propagated it\namong their acquaintance, and it was that same evening discoursed upon\nat several tea and card tables, with this variation from the truth, that\nthe debt amounted to twelve thousand, instead of twelve hundred pounds.\nFrom which circumstance it was conjectured, that Peregrine was a bite\nfrom the beginning, who had found credit on account of his effrontery\nand appearance, and imposed himself upon the town as a young gentleman\nof fortune. They rejoiced, therefore, at his calamity, which they\nconsidered as a just punishment for his fraud and presumption, and began\nto review certain particulars of his conduct, that plainly demonstrated\nhim to be a rank adventurer, long before he had arrived at this end of\nhis career.\n\nPickle, who now believed his glory was set for ever, received this\nintelligence with that disdain which enables a man to detach himself\neffectually from the world, and, with great tranquility, gave the\nmisanthrope an entertaining detail of what he had seen and heard since\ntheir last parting. While they amused themselves in this manner over\na dish of coffee they were joined by the parson, who congratulated our\nhero upon his bearing mischance with such philosophic quite, and began\nto regale the two friends with some curious circumstances relating to\nthe private history of the several prisoners, as they happened to come\nin. At length a gentleman entered; at sight of whom the clergyman rose\nup, and saluted him with a most reverential bow, which was graciously\nreturned by the stranger, who, with a young man that attended him,\nretired to the other end of the room. They were no sooner out of\nhearing, than the communicative priest desired his company to take\nparticular notice of this person to whom he had paid his respects.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis this day one of the most flagrant instances\nof neglected virtue which the world can produce. Over and above a cool\ndiscerning head, fraught with uncommon learning and experience, he\nis possessed of such fortitude and resolution, as no difficulties can\ndiscourage, and no danger impair; and so indefatigable in his humanity,\nthat even now, while he is surrounded with such embarrassments as would\ndistract the brain of an ordinary mortal, he has added considerably to\nhis encumbrances, by taking under his protection that young gentleman,\nwho, induced by his character, appealed to his benevolence for redress\nof the grievances under which he labours from the villainy of guardian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPeregrine's curiosity being excited by this encomium, asked the name of\nthis generous patron, of which when he was informed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am no stranger,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto the fame of that gentleman, who has made a considerable\nnoise in the world, on account of that great cause he undertook in\ndefence of an unhappy orphan; and, since he is a person of such an\namiable disposition, I am heartily sorry to find that his endeavours\nhave not met with that successful issue which their good fortune in the\nbeginning seemed to promise. Indeed, the circumstance of his espousing\nthat cause was so uncommon and romantic and the depravity of the\nhuman heart so universal, that some people, unacquainted with his real\ncharacter, imagined his views were altogether selfish; and some were not\nwanting, who affirmed he was a mere adventurer. Nevertheless, I must do\nhim the justice to own, I have heard some of the most virulent of those\nwho were concerned on the other side of the question, bear testimony\nin his favour, observing, that he was deceived into the expense of the\nwhole, by the plausible story which at first engaged his compassion.\nYour description of his character confirms me in the same opinion,\nthough I am quite ignorant of the affair; the particulars of which I\nshould be glad to learn, as well as the genuine account of his own life,\nmany circumstances of which are by his enemies, I believe, egregiously\nmisrepresented.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the priest, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is a piece of satisfaction which I am\nglad to find myself capable of giving you. I have had the pleasure of\nbeing acquainted with Mr. M-- from his youth, and everything which I\nshall relate concerning him, you may depend upon as a fact which hath\nfallen under my own cognizance, or been vouched upon the credit of\nundoubted evidence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. M--'s father was a minister of the established church of Scotland,\ndescended from a very ancient clan, and his mother nearly related to a\nnoble family in the northern part of that kingdom. While the son was\nboarded at a public school, where he made good progress in the Latin\ntongue, his father died, and he was left an orphan to the care of an\nuncle, who, finding him determined against any servile employment, kept\nhim at school, that he might prepare himself for the university, with a\nview of being qualified for his father's profession.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere his imagination was so heated by the warlike achievements he found\nrecorded in the Latin authors, such as Caesar, Curtius, and Buchanan,\nthat he was seized with an irresistible thirst of military glory, and\ndesire of trying his fortune in the army. His Majesty's troops taking\nthe field, in consequence of the rebellion which happened in the year\nseventeen hundred and fifteen, this young adventurer, thinking no life\nequal to that of a soldier, found means to furnish himself with a fusil\nand bayonet, and, leaving the school, repaired to the camp near Stirling\nwith a view of signalizing himself in the field, though he was at that\ntime but just turned of thirteen. He offered his service to several\nofficers, in hope of being enlisted in their companies; but they would\nnot receive him, because they rightly concluded, that he was some\nschoolboy broke loose, without the knowledge or consent of his\nrelations. Notwithstanding this discouragement, he continued in camp,\ncuriously prying into every part of the service; and such was the\nresolution conspicuous in him, even at such a tender age, that, after\nhis small finances were exhausted, he persisted in his design; and,\nbecause he would not make his wants known, actually subsisted for\nseveral days on hips, haws, and sloes, and other spontaneous fruits,\nwhich he gathered in the woods and fields. Meanwhile, he never failed\nto be present, when any regiment or corps of men were drawn out to be\nexercised and reviewed, and accompanied them in all their evolutions,\nwhich he had learned to great perfection, by observing the companies\nwhich were quartered in the place where he was at school. This eagerness\nand perseverance attracted the notice of many officers, who, after\nhaving commended his spirit and zeal, pressed him to return to his\nparents, and even threatened to expel him from the camp, if he would not\ncomply with their advice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese remonstrances having no other effect than that of warning him to\navoid his monitors, they thought proper to alter their behaviour towards\nhim, took him into their protection, and even into their mess, and\nwhat, above all other marks of favour, pleased the young soldier most,\npermitted him to incorporate in the battalion, and take his turn of\nduty with the other men. In this happy situation he was discovered by a\nrelation of his mother, who was a captain in the army, and who used all\nhis authority and influence in persuading M-- to return to school; but,\nfinding him deaf to his admonitions and threats, he took him under his\nown care, and, when the army marched to Dumblane, left him at Stirling\nwith express injunctions to keep himself within the walls.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe temporized with his kinsman, fearing that, should he seem\nrefractory, the captain would have ordered him to be shut up in the\ncastle. Inflamed with the desire of seeing a battle, his relation no\nsooner marched off the ground, than he mixed in with another regiment,\nto which his former patrons belonged, and proceeded to the field,\nwhere he distinguished himself, even at that early time of life, by his\ngallantry, in helping to retrieve a pair of colours belonging to M--n's\nregiment; so that, after the affair, he was presented to the duke of\nArgyll, and recommended strongly to Brigadier Grant, who invited him\ninto his regiment, and promised to provide for him with the first\nopportunity. But that gentleman in a little time lost his command upon\nthe duke's disgrace, and the regiment was ordered for Ireland, being\ngiven to Colonel Nassau, whose favour the young volunteer acquired to\nsuch a degree, that he was recommended to the king for his ensigncy,\nwhich in all probability he would have obtained, had not the regiment\nbeen unluckily reduced.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn consequence of this reduction, which happened in the most severe\nseason of the year, he was obliged to return to his own country, through\ninfinite hardships, to which he was exposed from the narrowness of his\ncircumstances. And continuing still enamoured of a military life, he\nentered into the regiment of Scots Greys, at that time commanded by\nthe late Sir James Campbell, who, being acquainted with his family and\ncharacter, encouraged him with a promise of speedy preferment. In this\ncorps he remained three years, during which he had no opportunity of\nseeing actual service, except at the affair of Glensheel; and this\nlife of insipid quiet must have hung heavy upon a youth of M--'s active\ndisposition, had not he found exercise for the mind, in reading books\nof amusement, history, voyages, and geography, together with those that\ntreated of the art of war, ancient and modern, for which he contracted\nsuch an eager appetite, that he used to spend sixteen hours a day in\nthis employment. About that time he became acquainted with a gentleman\nof learning and taste, who observing his indefatigable application,\nand insatiable thirst after knowledge, took upon himself the charge of\nsuperintending his studies; and, by the direction of such an able guide,\nthe young soldier converted his attention to a more solid and profitable\ncourse of reading. So inordinate was his desire of making speedy\nadvances in the paths of learning, that within the compass of three\nmonths, he diligently perused the writings of Locke and Malebranche,\nand made himself master of the first six and of the eleventh and twelfth\nbooks of Euclid's Elements. He considered Puffendorf and Grotius with\nuncommon care, acquired a tolerable degree of knowledge in the French\nlanguage, and his imagination was so captivated with the desire of\nlearning, that, seeing no prospect of a war, or views of being provided\nfor in the service, he quitted the army, and went through a regular\ncourse of university education. Having made such progress in his\nstudies, he resolved to qualify himself for the church, and acquired\nsuch a stock of school divinity, under the instructions of a learned\nprofessor at Edinburgh, that he more than once mounted the rostrum\nin the public hall, and held forth with uncommon applause. But being\ndiscouraged from a prosecution of his plan, by the unreasonable\nausterity of some of the Scotch clergy, by whom the most indifferent\nand innocent words and actions were often misconstrued into levity and\nmisconduct, he resolved to embrace the first favourable opportunity\nof going abroad, being inflamed with the desire of seeing foreign\ncountries; and actually set out for Holland, where, for the space of\ntwo years, he studied the Roman law, with the law of nature and nations,\nunder the famous professors Tolieu and Barbeyrac.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving thus finished his school education, he set out for Paris, with\na view to make himself perfect in the French language, and learn such\nuseful exercises, as might be acquired with the wretched remnant of his\nslender estate, which was by that time reduced very low. In his journey\nthrough the Netherlands, he went to Namur, and paid his respects to\nBishop Strickland and General Collier, by whom he was received with\ngreat civility, in consequence of letters of recommendation, with which\nhe was provided from the Hague; and the old general assured him of his\nprotection and interest for a pair of colours, if he was disposed to\nenter into the Dutch service. Though he was by that time pretty well\ncured of his military quixotism, he would not totally decline the\ngenerous proffer, for which he thanked him in the most grateful terms,\ntelling the general that he would pay his duty to him on his return from\nFrance, and then, if he could determine upon re-engaging in the army,\nshould think himself highly honoured in being under his command.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter a stay of two months in Flanders, he proceeded to Paris, and, far\nfrom taking up his habitation in the suburbs of St. Germain, according\nto the custom of English travellers, he hired a private lodging on the\nother side of the river, and associated chiefly with French officers,\nwho, their youthful sallies being over, are allowed to be the politest\ngentlemen of that kingdom. In this scheme he found his account so much,\nthat he could not but wonder at the folly of his countrymen, who lose\nthe main scope of their going abroad, by spending their time and fortune\nidly with one another.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDuring his residence in Holland, he had made himself acquainted with\nthe best authors in the French language, so that he was able to share\nin their conversation; a circumstance from which he found great benefit;\nfor it not only improved him in his knowledge of that tongue, but also\ntended to the enlargement of his acquaintance, in the course of which he\ncontracted intimacies in some families of good fashion, especially those\nof the long robe, which would have enabled him to pass his time very\nagreeably, had he been a little easier in point of fortune. But his\nfinances, notwithstanding the most rigid economy, being in a few months\nreduced to a very low ebb, the prospect of indigence threw a damp upon\nall his pleasures, though he never suffered himself to be thereby in any\ndegree dispirited; being in that respect of so happy a disposition, that\nconscious poverty or abundance made very slight impressions upon his\nmind. This consumption of his cash, however, involved him in some\nperplexity, and he deliberated with himself, whether he should return to\nGeneral Collier, or repair to London, where he might possibly fall\ninto some business not unbecoming a gentleman; though he was very much\nmortified to find himself incapable of gratifying an inordinate desire\nwhich possessed him of making the grand tour, or, at least, of visiting\nthe southern parts of France.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile he thus hesitated between different suggestions, he was one\nmorning visited by a gentleman who had sought and cultivated his\nfriendship, and for whom he had done a good office, in supporting him\nwith spirit against a brutal German, with whom he had an affair of\nhonour. This gentleman came to propose a party for a fortnight, to\nFontainebleau, where the court then was; and the proposal being declined\nby M-- with more than usual stiffness, his friend was very urgent to\nknow the reason of his refusal, and at length, with some confusion,\nsaid, 'Perhaps your finances are low?' M-- replied, that he had\nwherewithal to defray the expense of his journey to London, where he\ncould be furnished with a fresh supply; and this answer was no sooner\nmade, than the other taking him by the hand, 'My dear friend,' said he,\n'I am not unacquainted with your affairs, and would have offered you my\ncredit long ago, if I had thought it would be acceptable; even now, I do\nnot pretend to give you money, but desire and insist upon it, that you\nwill accept of the loan of these two pieces of paper, to be repaid when\nyou marry a woman with a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, or obtain an\nemployment of a thousand a year.' So saying, he presented him with two\nactions of above two thousand livres each.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cM-- was astonished at this unexpected instance of generosity, in a\nstranger, and, with suitable acknowledgment, peremptorily refused to\nincur such an obligation; but at length he was, by dint of importunity\nand warm expostulation, prevailed upon to accept one of the actions, on\ncondition that the gentleman would take his note for the sum; and this\nhe absolutely rejected, until M-- promised to draw upon him for double\nthe value or more, in case he should at any time want a further supply.\nThis uncommon act of friendship and generosity, afterwards had an\nopportunity to repay tenfold, though he could not help regretting the\noccasion, on his friend's account. That worthy man having, by placing\ntoo much confidence in a villainous lawyer, and a chain of other\nmisfortunes, involved himself and his amiable lady in a labyrinth of\ndifficulties, which threatened the total ruin of his family, M-- felt\nthe inexpressible satisfaction of delivering his benefactor from the\nsnare.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeing thus reinforced by the generosity of his friend, M-- resolved to\nexecute his former plan of seeing the south of France, together with the\nsea-ports of Spain, as far as Cadiz, from whence he proposed to take a\npassage for London by sea; and, with this view, sent forward his trunks\nby the diligence to Lyons, determined to ride post, in order to enjoy a\nbetter view of the country, and for the conveniency of stopping at those\nplaces where there was anything remarkable to be seen or inquired into.\nWhile he was employed in taking leave of his Parisian friends, who\nfurnished him with abundant recommendation, a gentleman of his own\ncountry, who spoke little or no French, hearing of his intention,\nbegged the favour of accompanying him in his expedition. With this new\ncompanion, therefore, he set out for Lyons, where he was perfectly well\nreceived by the intendant and some of the best families of the place, in\nconsequence of his letters of recommendation; and, after a short stay\nin that city, proceeded down the Rhone to Avignon, in what is called the\ncoche d'eau; then visiting the principal towns of Dauphiny, Languedoc,\nand Provence, he returned to the delightful city of Marseilles, where he\nand his fellow-traveller were so much captivated by the serenity of the\nair, the good-nature and hospitality of the sprightly inhabitants, that\nthey never dreamed of changing their quarters during the whole winter\nand part of the spring: here he acquired the acquaintance of the Marquis\nd'Argens, attorney-general in the parliament of Aix, and of his eldest\nson, who now makes so great a figure in the literary world; and when the\naffair of Father Girard and Mademoiselle Cadiere began to make a noise,\nhe accompanied these two gentlemen to Toulon, where the marquis was\nordered to take a precognition of the facts.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn his return to Marseilles, he found a certain noble lord of great\nfortune, under the direction of a Swiss governor, who had accommodated\nhim with two of his own relations, of the same country, by way of\ncompanions, together with five servants in his train. They being\nabsolute strangers in the place, M--introduced them to the intendant,\nand several other good families, and had the good fortune to be so\nagreeable to his lordship, that he proposed and even pressed him to live\nwith him in England as a friend and companion, and to take upon him the\nsuperintendence of his affairs, in which case he would settle upon him\nfour hundred a year for life.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis proposal was too advantageous to be slighted by a person of no\nfortune, or fixed establishment: he therefore made no difficulty of\nclosing with it; but, as his lordship's departure was fixed to a short\nday, and he urged him to accompany him to Paris, and from thence to\nEngland, M-- thought it would be improper and indecent to interfere with\nthe office of his governor, who might take umbrage at his favour, and\ntherefore excused himself from a compliance with his lordship's request,\nuntil his minority should be expired, as he was within a few months of\nbeing of age. However, he repeated his importunities so earnestly, and\nthe governor joined in the request with such appearance of cordiality,\nthat he was prevailed upon to comply with their joint desire; and in a\nfew days set out with them for Paris, by the way of Lyons. But, before\nthey had been three days in the city, M-- perceived a total change\nin the behaviour of the Swiss and his two relations, who, in all\nprobability, became jealous of his influence with his lordship; and he\nno sooner made this discovery, than he resolved to withdraw himself from\nsuch a disagreeable participation of that young nobleman's favour. He,\ntherefore, in spite of all his lordship's entreaties and remonstrances,\nquitted him for the present, alleging, as a pretext, that he had a\nlonging desire to see Switzerland and the banks of the Rhine, and\npromising to meet him again in England.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis his intention being made known to the governor and his friends,\ntheir countenances immediately cleared up, their courtesy and\ncomplaisance returned, and they even furnished him with letters for\nGeneva, Lausanne, Bern, and Soleures; in consequence of which he met\nwith unusual civilities at these places. Having made this tour with his\nScotch friend, who came up to him before he left Lyons, and visited the\nmost considerable towns on both sides of the Rhine, and the courts of\nthe electors Palatine, Mentz, and Cologne, he arrived in Holland; and\nfrom thence, through the Netherlands, repaired to London, where he found\nmy lord just returned from Paris.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis lordship received him with expressions of uncommon joy, would not\nsuffer him to stir from him for several days, and introduced him to his\nrelations. M-- accompanied his lordship from London to his country seat,\nwhere he was indeed treated with great friendship and confidence, and\nconsulted in everything; but the noble peer never once made mention of\nthe annuity which he had promised to settle upon him, nor did M--\nremind him of it, because he conceived it was his affair to fulfil his\nengagements of his own accord. M-- being tired of the manner of living\nat this place, made an excursion to Bath, where he stayed about a\nfortnight, to partake of the diversions, and, upon his return, found his\nlordship making dispositions for another journey to Paris.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSurprised at this sudden resolution, he endeavoured to dissuade\nhim from it; but his remonstrances were rendered ineffectual by the\ninsinuations of a foreigner who had come over with him, and filled his\nimagination with extravagant notions of pleasure, infinitely superior\nto any which he could enjoy while he was in the trammels and under the\nrestraints of a governor. He, therefore, turned a deaf ear to all M--'s\narguments, and entreated him to accompany him in the journey; but\nthis gentleman, foreseeing that a young man, like my lord, of strong\npassions, and easy to be misled, would, in all probability, squander\naway great sums of money, in a way that would neither do credit to\nhimself, or to those who were concerned with him, resisted all his\nsolicitations, on pretence of having business of consequence at London;\nand afterwards had reason to be extremely well pleased with his own\nconduct in this particular.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBefore he set out on this expedition, M--, in justice to himself,\nreminded him of the proposal which he had made to him at Marseilles,\ndesiring to know if he had altered his design in that particular; in\nwhich case he would turn his thoughts some other way, as he would not\nin the least be thought to intrude or pin himself upon any man. My lord\nprotested in the most solemn manner, that he still continued in his\nformer resolution, and, again beseeching him to bear him company into\nFrance, promised that everything should be settled to his satisfaction\nupon their return to England. M--, however, still persisted in his\nrefusal, for the above-mentioned reasons, and, though he never heard\nmore of the annuity, he nevertheless continued to serve his lordship\nwith his advice and good offices ever after; particularly in directing\nhis choice to an alliance with a lady of eminent virtue, the daughter of\na noble lord, more conspicuous for his shining parts than the splendour\nof his titles; a circumstance upon which he always reflected with\nparticular satisfaction, as well on account of the extraordinary merit\nof the lady, as because it vested in her children a considerable part\nof that great estate, which of right belonged to her grandmother, and\nafterwards put him in a way to retrieve his estate from a heavy load of\ndebt he had contracted. When my lord set out on his Paris expedition,\nthe money M-- had received from his generous friend at Paris was almost\nreduced to the last guinea. He had not yet reaped the least benefit from\nhis engagements with his lordship; and, disdaining to ask for a supply\nfrom him, he knew not how to subsist, with any degree of credit, till\nhis return.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis uncomfortable prospect was the more disagreeable to him, as, at\nthat time of life, he was much inclined to appear in the gay world, had\ncontracted a taste for plays, operas, and other public diversions, and\nacquired an acquaintance with many people of good fashion, which could\nnot be maintained without a considerable expense. In this emergency,\nhe thought he could not employ his idle time more profitably than in\ntranslating, from foreign languages, such books as were then chiefly in\nvogue; and upon application to a friend, who was a man of letters, he\nwas furnished with as much business of that kind as he could possibly\nmanage, and wrote some pamphlets on the reigning controversies of that\ntime, that had the good fortune to please. He was also concerned in a\nmonthly journal of literature, and the work was carried on by the two\nfriends jointly, though M-- did not at all appear in the partnership.\nBy these means he not only spent his mornings in useful exercise but\nsupplied himself with money for what the French call the menus plaisirs,\nduring the whole summer. He frequented all the assemblies in and about\nLondon, and considerably enlarged his acquaintance among the fair sex.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe had, upon his first arrival in England, become acquainted with a\nlady at an assembly not far from London; and though, at that time, he\nhad no thoughts of extending his views farther than the usual gallantry\nof the place, he met with such distinguishing marks of her regard in\nthe sequel, and was so particularly encouraged by the advice of another\nlady, with whom he had been intimate in France, and who was now of\ntheir parties, that he could not help entertaining hopes of making an\nimpression upon the heart of his agreeable partner, who was a young lady\nof an ample fortune and great expectations. He therefore cultivated her\ngood graces with all the assiduity and address of which he was master,\nand succeeded so well in his endeavours, that, after a due course of\nattendance, and the death of an aunt, by which she received an accession\nof fortune to the amount of three and twenty thousand pounds, he\nventured to declare his passion, and she not only heard him with\npatience and approbation, but also replied in terms adequate to his\nwarmest wish.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFinding himself so favourably received, he pressed her to secure his\nhappiness by marriage; but, to this proposal, she objected the recency\nof her kinswoman's death, which would have rendered such a step highly\nindecent, and the displeasure of her other relations, from whom she had\nstill greater expectations, and who, at that time, importuned her to\nmarry a cousin of her own, whom she could not like. However, that M--\nmight have no cause to repine at her delay, she freely entered with\nhim into an intimacy of correspondence; during which nothing could have\nadded to their mutual felicity, which was the more poignant and refined,\nfrom the mysterious and romantic manner of their enjoying it; for,\nthough he publicly visited her as an acquaintance, his behaviour on\nthese occasions was always so distant, respectful, and reserved, that\nthe rest of the company could not possibly suspect the nature of their\nreciprocal attachment; in consequence of which they used to have private\ninterviews, unknown to every soul upon earth, except her maid, who was\nnecessarily entrusted with the secret.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this manner they enjoyed the conversation of each other for above\ntwelve months, without the least interruption; and though the stability\nof Mr. M--'s fortune depended entirely upon their marriage, yet as\nhe perceived his mistress so averse to it, he never urged it with\nvehemence, nor was at all anxious on that score, being easily induced\nto defer a ceremony, which, as he then thought, could in no shape\nhave added to their satisfaction, though he hath since altered his\nsentiments. Be that as it will, his indulgent mistress, in order to\nset his mind at ease in that particular, and in full confidence of his\nhonour, insisted on his accepting a deed of gift of her whole fortune,\nin consideration of her intended marriage; and, after some difficulty,\nhe was prevailed upon to receive this proof of her esteem, well knowing\nthat it would still be in his power to return the obligation. Though she\noften entreated him to take upon himself the entire administration of\nher finances, and upon divers occasions pressed him to accept of large\nsums, he never once abused her generous disposition, or solicited her\nfor money, except for some humane purpose, which she was always more\nready to fulfil than he to propose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the course of this correspondence, he became acquainted with some\nof her female relations, and, among the rest, with a young lady, so\neminently adorned with all the qualifications of mind and person, that,\nnotwithstanding all his philosophy and caution, he could not behold and\nconverse with her, without being deeply smitten with her charms. He did\nall in his power to discourage this dangerous invasion in the beginning,\nand to conceal the least symptom of it from her relation; he summoned\nall his reflection to his aid, and, thinking it would be base and\ndishonest to cherish any sentiment repugnant to the affection which he\nowed to a mistress who had placed such unlimited confidence in him, he\nattempted to stifle the infant flame, by avoiding the amiable inspirer\nof it. But the passion had taken too deep a root in his heart to be\nso easily extirpated; his absence from the dear object increased\nthe impatience of his love: the intestine conflict between that and\ngratitude deprived him of his rest and appetite. He was, in a short\ntime, emaciated by continual watching, anxiety, and want of nourishment,\nand so much altered from his usual cheerfulness, that his mistress,\nbeing surprised and alarmed at the change, which, from the symptoms, she\njudged was owing to some uneasiness of mind, took all imaginable\npains to discover the cause. In all probability it did not escape her\npenetration; for she more than once asked if he was in love with her\ncousin; protesting that, far from being an obstacle to his happiness,\nshe would, in that case, be an advocate for his passion. However,\nthis declaration was never made without manifest signs of anxiety and\nuneasiness, which made such an impression upon the heart of M--, that he\nresolved to sacrifice his happiness, and even his life, rather than take\nany step which might be construed into an injury or insult to a person\nwho had treated him with such generosity and goodness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn consequence of this resolution, he formed another, which was to go\nabroad, under pretence of recovering his health, but in reality to avoid\nthe temptation, as well as the suspicion of being inconstant; and in\nthis design he was confirmed by his physician, who actually thought him\nin the first stage of a consumption, and therefore advised him to repair\nto the south of France. He communicated his design, with the doctor's\nopinion, to the lady, who agreed to it with much less difficulty than he\nfound in conquering his own reluctance at parting with the dear object\nof his love. The consent of his generous mistress being obtained, he\nwaited upon her with the instrument whereby she had made the conveyance\nof her fortune to him; and all his remonstrances being insufficient\nto persuade her to take it back, he cancelled it in her presence,\nand placed it in that state upon her toilet, while she was dressing;\nwhereupon she shed a torrent of tears, saying, she now plainly perceived\nthat he wanted to tear himself from her, and that his affections were\nsettled upon another. He was sensibly affected by this proof of her\nconcern, and endeavoured to calm the perturbation of her mind, by vowing\neternal fidelity, and pressing her to accept of his hand in due form\nbefore his departure. By these means her transports were quieted for the\npresent, and the marriage deferred for the same prudential reasons which\nhad hitherto prevented it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMatters being thus compromised, and the day fixed for his departure,\nshe, together with her faithful maid, one morning visited him for the\nfirst time at his own lodgings; and, after breakfast, desiring to speak\nwith him in private, he conducted her into another room, where assuming\nan unusual gravity of aspect, 'My dear M--,' said she, 'you are now\ngoing to leave me, and God alone knows if ever we shall meet again;\ntherefore, if you really love me with that tenderness which you profess,\nyou will accept of this mark of my friendship and unalterable affection;\nit will at least be a provision for your journey, and if an accident\nshould befall me, before I have the happiness of receiving you again\ninto my arms, I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that you are\nnot altogether without resource.' So saying, she put an embroidered\npocket-book into his hand. He expressed the high sense he had of her\ngenerosity and affection in the most pathetic terms, and begged leave\nto suspend his acceptance, until he should know the contents of her\npresent, which was so extraordinary, that he absolutely refused to\nreceive it. He was, however, by her repeated entreaties, in a manner\ncompelled to receive about one-half, and she afterwards insisted upon\nhis taking a reinforcement of a considerable sum for the expense of his\njourney.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving stayed with her ten days beyond the time he had fixed for his\ndeparture, and settled the method of their correspondence, he took his\nleave, with a heart full of sorrow, anxiety, and distraction, produced\nfrom the different suggestions of his duty and love. He then set out for\nFrance, and, after a short stay at Paris, proceeded to Aix in Provence,\nand from thence to Marseilles, at which two places he continued for some\nmonths. But nothing he met with being able to dissipate those melancholy\nideas which still preyed upon his imagination, and affected his spirits,\nhe endeavoured to elude them with a succession of new objects; and, with\nthat view, persuaded a counsellor of the parliament of Aix, a man of\ngreat worth, learning, and good-humour, to accompany him in making a\ntour of those parts of France which he had not yet seen. On their return\nfrom this excursion, they found at Aix an Italian abbe, a person of\ncharacter, and great knowledge of men and books, who, having travelled\nall over Germany and France, was so far on his return to his own\ncountry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cM-- having, by means of his friend the counsellor, contracted an\nacquaintance with this gentleman, and, being desirous of seeing some\nparts of Italy, particularly the carnival at Venice, they set out\ntogether from Marseilles in a tartan for Genoa, coasting it all the\nway, and lying on shore every night. Having shown him what was most\nremarkable in this city, his friend the abbe was so obliging as to\nconduct him through Tuscany, and the most remarkable cities in Lombardy,\nto Venice, where M-- insisted upon defraying the expense of the whole\ntour, in consideration of the abbe's complaisance, which had been\nof infinite service to him in the course of this expedition. Having\nremained five weeks at Venice, he was preparing to set out for Rome,\nwith some English gentlemen whom he had met by accident, when he was\nall of a sudden obliged to change his resolution by some disagreeable\nletters which he received from London. He had, from his first departure,\ncorresponded with his generous, though inconstant mistress, with a\nreligious exactness and punctuality; nor was she, for some time, less\nobservant of the agreement they had made. Nevertheless, she, by degrees,\nbecame so negligent and cold in her expression, and so slack in her\ncorrespondence, that he could not help observing and upbraiding her with\nsuch indifference; and her endeavours to palliate it were supported by\npretexts so frivolous, as to be easily seen through by a lover of very\nlittle discernment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile he tortured himself with conjectures about the cause of this\nunexpected change, he received such intelligence from England, as, when\njoined with what he himself had perceived by her manner of writing,\nleft him little or no room to doubt of her fickleness and inconstancy.\nNevertheless, as he knew by experience that informations of that kind\nare not to be entirely relied upon, he resolved to be more certainly\napprised: and, for that end, departed immediately for London, by the\nway of Tyrol, Bavaria, Alsace, and Paris. On his arrival in England, he\nlearned, with infinite concern, that his intelligence had not been\nat all exaggerated; and his sorrow was inexpressible to find a person\nendowed with so many other noble and amiable qualities, seduced into\nan indiscretion, that of necessity ruined the whole plan which had been\nconcerted between them for their mutual happiness. She made several\nattempts, by letters and interviews, to palliate her conduct, and soften\nhim into a reconciliation; but his honour being concerned, he remained\ndeaf to all her entreaties and proposals. Nevertheless, I have often\nheard him say, that he could not help loving her, and revering the\nmemory of a person to whose generosity and goodness he owed his fortune,\nand one whose foibles were overbalanced by a thousand good qualities. He\noften insisted on making restitution; but far from complying with that\nproposal, she afterwards often endeavoured to lay him under yet greater\nobligations of the same kind, and importuned him with the warmest\nsolicitations to renew their former correspondence, which he as often\ndeclined.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cM-- took this instance of the inconstancy of the sex so much to\nheart, that he had almost resolved for the future to keep clear of all\nengagements for life, and returned to Paris, in order to dissipate his\nanxiety, where he hired an apartment in one of the academies, in the\nexercises whereof he took singular delight. During his residence at\nthis place, he had the good fortune to ingratiate himself with a\ngreat general, a descendant of one of the most ancient and illustrious\nfamilies in France; having attracted his notice by some remarks he had\nwritten on Folard's Polybius, which were accidentally shown to that\ngreat man by one of his aides-de-camp, who was a particular friend of\nM--. The favour he had thus acquired was strengthened by his assiduities\nand attention. Upon his return to London, he sent some of Handel's\nnewest compositions to the prince, who was particularly fond of that\ngentleman's productions, together with Clark's edition of Caesar; and,\nin the spring of the same year, before the French army took the field,\nhe was honoured with a most obliging letter from the prince, inviting\nhim to come over, if he wanted to see the operations of the campaign,\nand desiring he would give himself no trouble about his equipage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cM-- having still some remains of a military disposition, and this to be\na more favourable opportunity than any he should ever meet with again,\nreadily embraced the offer, and sacrificed the soft delights of love,\nwhich at that time he enjoyed without control, to an eager, laborious,\nand dangerous curiosity. In that and the following campaign, during\nwhich he was present at the siege of Philipsburgh, and several other\nactions, he enlarged his acquaintance among the French officers,\nespecially those of the graver sort, who had a taste for books and\nliterature; and the friendship and interest of those gentlemen were\nafterwards of singular service to him, though in an affair altogether\nforeign from their profession. He had all along made diligent inquiry\ninto the trade and manufactures of the countries through which he had\noccasion to travel, more particularly those of Holland, England, and\nFrance; and, as he was well acquainted with the revenue and farms of\nthis last kingdom, he saw with concern the great disadvantages under\nwhich our tobacco trade, the most considerable branch of our commerce\nwith that people, was carried on; what inconsiderable returns were made\nto the planters, out of the low price given by the French company; and\nhow much it was in the power of that company to reduce it still lower.\nM-- had formed a scheme to remedy this evil, so far as it related to the\nnational loss or gain, by not permitting the duty of one penny in\nthe pound, old subsidy, to be drawn back, on tobacco, re-exported. He\ndemonstrated to the ministry of that time, that so inconsiderable a duty\ncould not in the least diminish the demand from abroad, which was the\nonly circumstance to be apprehended, and that the yearly produce of that\nrevenue would amount to one hundred and twenty thousand pounds, without\none shilling additional expense to the public; but the ministry having\nthe excise scheme then in contemplation, could think of no other till\nthat should be tried; and that project having miscarried, he renewed his\napplication, when they approved of his scheme in every particular, but\ndiscovered a surprising backwardness to carry it into execution.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis expectations in this quarter being disappointed, he, by the\ninterposition of his friends, presented a plan to the French company, in\nwhich he set forth the advantages that would accrue to themselves from\nfixing the price, and securing that sort of tobacco which best suited\nthe taste of the public and their manufacture; and finally proposed to\nfurnish them with any quantity, at the price which they paid in the port\nof London.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter some dispute, they agreed to this proposal, and contracted\nwith him for fifteen thousand hogsheads a year, for which they obliged\nthemselves to pay ready money, on its arrival in any one or more\nconvenient ports in the south or western coasts of Great Britain that he\nshould please to fix upon for that purpose. M-- no sooner obtained this\ncontract, than he immediately set out for America, in order to put it\nin execution; and, by way of companion, carried with him a little French\nabbe, a man of humour, wit, and learning, with whom he had been long\nacquainted, and for whom he had done many good offices.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn his arrival in Virginia, which opportunely happened at a time when\nall the gentlemen were assembled in the capital of that province, he\npublished a memorial, representing the disadvantages under which their\ntrade was carried on, the true method of redressing their own grievances\nin that respect, and proposing to contract with them for the yearly\nquantity of fifteen thousand hogsheads of such tobacco as was fit for\nthe French market, at the price which he demonstrated to be considerably\ngreater than that which they had formerly received. This remonstrance\nmet with all the success and encouragement he could expect. The\nprincipal planters, seeing their own interest concerned, readily\nassented to the proposal, which, through their influence, was also\nrelished by the rest; and the only difficulty that remained, related to\nthe security for payment of the bills on the arrival of the tobacco in\nEngland, and to the time stipulated for the continuance of the contract.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn order to remove these objections, Mr. M-- returned to Europe, and\nfound the French company of farmers disposed to agree to everything he\ndesired for facilitating the execution of the contract, and perfectly\nwell pleased with the sample which he had already sent; but his\ngood friend the abbe, whom he had left behind him in America, by an\nunparalleled piece of treachery, found means to overturn the whole\nproject. He secretly wrote a memorial to the company, importing, that he\nfound, by experience, M-- could afford to furnish them at a much lower\nprice than that which they had agreed to give; and that, by being in\npossession of the contract for five years, as was intended according to\nthe proposal, he would have the company so much in his power, that they\nmust afterwards submit to any price he should please to impose; and\nthat, if they thought him worth of such a trust, he would undertake to\nfurnish them at an easier rate, in conjunction with some of the leading\nmen in Virginia and Maryland, with whom, he said, he had already\nconcerted measures for that purpose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe company were so much alarmed at these insinuations, that they\ndeclined complying with Mr. M--'s demands until the abbe's return; and,\nthough they afterwards used all their endeavours to persuade him to be\nconcerned with that little traitor in his undertaking, by which he\nmight still have been a very considerable gainer, he resisted all their\nsolicitations, and plainly told them, in the abbe's presence, that\nhe would never prostitute his own principles so far, as to enter into\nengagements of any kind with a person of his character, much less in a\nscheme that had a manifest tendency to lower the market price of tobacco\nin England.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThus ended a project the most extensive, simple, and easy, and, as\nappeared by the trial made, the best calculated to raise an immense\nfortune of any that was ever undertaken or planned by a private person;\na project, in the execution of which M-- had the good of the public, and\nthe glory of putting in a flourishing condition the valuable branch of\nour trade which gives employment to two great provinces and above two\nhundred sail of ships, much more at heart than his own private interest.\nIt was reasonable to expect, that a man whose debts M-- had paid more\nthan once, whom he had obliged in many other respects, and whom he had\ncarried with him at a very considerable expense, on this expedition,\nmerely with a view of bettering his fortune, would have acted with\ncommon honesty, if not with gratitude; but such was the depravity\nof this little monster's heart, that, on his deathbed, he left a\nconsiderable fortune to mere strangers, with whom he had little or no\nconnection, without the least thought of refunding the money advanced\nfor him by M--, in order to prevent his rotting in a jail.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen M-- had once obtained a command of money, he, by his knowledge\nin several branches of trade, as well as by the assistance of some\nintelligent friends at Paris and London, found means to employ it to\nvery good purpose; and had he been a man of that selfish disposition,\nwhich too much prevails in the world, he might have been at this day\nmaster of a very ample fortune; but his ear was never deaf to the voice\nof distress, nor his beneficent heart shut against the calamities of his\nfellow-creatures. He was even ingenious in contriving the most\ndelicate methods of relieving modest indigence, and, by his industrious\nbenevolence, often anticipated the requests of misery.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI could relate a number of examples to illustrate my assertions, in\nsome of which you would perceive the most disinterested generosity;\nbut such a detail would trespass too much upon your time, and I do not\npretend to dwell upon every minute circumstance of his conduct. Let it\nsuffice to say, that, upon the declaration of war in Spain, he gave up\nall his commercial schemes, and called in his money from all quarters,\nwith a view of sitting down, for the rest of his life, contented with\nwhat he had got, and restraining his liberalities to what he could spare\nfrom his yearly income. This was a very prudential resolution, could\nhe have kept it; but, upon the breaking out of the war, he could not\nwithout concern see many gentlemen of merit, who had been recommended\nto him, disappointed of commissions, merely for want of money to satisfy\nthe expectations of the commission-brokers of that time; and therefore\nlaunched out considerable sums for them on their bare notes, great part\nwhereof was lost by the death of some in the unfortunate expedition\nto the West Indies. He at length, after many other actions of the like\nnature, from motives of pure humanity, love of justice, and abhorrence\nof oppression, embarked in a cause, every way the most important that\never came under the discussion of the courts of law in these kingdoms;\nwhether it be considered in relation to the extraordinary nature of the\ncase, or the immense property of no less than fifty thousand pounds a\nyear, and three peerages that depended upon it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the year 1740, the brave admiral who at that time commanded his\nmajesty's fleet in the West Indies, among the other transactions of his\nsquadron transmitted to the duke of Newcastle, mentioned a young man,\nwho, though in the capacity of a common sailor on board one of the ships\nunder his command, laid claim to the estate and titles of the earl of\nA--. These pretensions were no sooner communicated in the public papers,\nthan they became the subject of conversation in all companies; and the\nperson whom they chiefly affected, being alarmed at the appearance of a\ncompetitor, though at such a distance, began to put himself in motion,\nand take all the precautions which he thought necessary to defeat\nthe endeavour of the young upstart. Indeed, the early intelligence he\nreceived of Mr. A--'s making himself known in the West Indies, furnished\nhim with numberless advantages over that unhappy young gentleman; for,\nbeing in possession of a splendid fortune, and lord of many manors in\nthe neighbourhood of the very place where the claimant was born, he\nknew all the witnesses who could give the most material evidence of his\nlegitimacy; and, if his probity did not restrain him, had, by his power\nand influence, sufficient opportunity and means of applying to the\npassions and interests of the witnesses, to silence many, and gain over\nothers to his side; while his competitor, by an absence of fifteen\nor sixteen years from his native country, the want of education and\nfriends, together with his present helpless situation, was rendered\nabsolutely incapable of taking any step for his own advantage. And\nalthough his worthy uncle's conspicuous virtue, and religious regard for\njustice and truth, might possibly be an unconquerable restraint to his\ntaking any undue advantages, yet the consciences of that huge army\nof emissaries he kept in pay were not altogether so very tender and\nscrupulous. This much, however, may be said, without derogation from,\nor impeachment of, the noble earl's nice virtue and honour, that he\ntook care to compromise all differences with the other branches of the\nfamily, whose interests were, in this affair, connected with his own,\nby sharing the estate with them, and also retained most of the eminent\ncounsel within the bar of both kingdoms against this formidable bastard,\nbefore any suit was instituted by him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile he was thus entrenching himself against the attack of a poor\nforlorn youth, at the distance of fifteen hundred leagues, continually\nexposed to the dangers of the sea, the war, and an unhealthy climate,\nMr. M--, in the common course of conversation, chanced to ask some\nquestions relating to this romantic pretender, of one H--, who was at\nthat time the present Lord A--'s chief agent. This man, when pressed,\ncould not help owning that the late Lord A-- actually left a son, who\nhad been spirited away into America soon after his father's death, but\nsaid he did not know whether this was the same person. This information\ncould not fail to make an impression on the humanity of Mr. M--, who,\nbeing acquainted with the genius of the wicked party who had possessed\nthemselves of this unhappy young man's estate and honours, expressed\nno small anxiety and apprehension lest they should take him off by some\nmeans or other; and, even then, seemed disposed to contribute\ntowards the support of the friendless orphan, and to inquire more\ncircumstantially into the nature of his claim. In the meantime his\noccasions called him to France, and during his absence Mr. A-- arrived\nin London in the month of October, 174l.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere the clergyman was interrupted by Peregrine, who said there was\nsomething so extraordinary, not to call it improbable, in the account he\nhad heard of the young gentleman's being sent into exile, that he would\nlook upon himself as infinitely obliged to the doctor, if he would\nfavour him with a true representation of that transaction, as well as of\nthe manner in which he arrived and was known at the Island of Jamaica.\n\nThe parson, in compliance with our hero's request, taking up the story\nfrom the beginning, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. A--,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis the son of Arthur, late lord\nbaron of A--, by his wife Mary S--, natural daughter to John, duke of\nB-- and N--, whom he publicly married on the 21st day of July, 1706,\ncontrary to the inclination of his mother, and all his other relations,\nparticularly of Arthur, late earl of A--, who bore an implacable enmity\nto the duke her father, and, for that reason, did all that lay in his\npower to traverse the marriage; but, finding his endeavours ineffectual,\nhe was so much offended, that he would never be perfectly reconciled to\nLord A--, though he was his presumptive heir. After their nuptials,\nthey cohabited together in England for the space of two or three years,\nduring which she miscarried more than once; and he being a man of\nlevity, and an extravagant disposition, not only squandered away all\nthat he had received of his wife's fortune, but also contracted many\nconsiderable debts, which obliged him to make a precipitate retreat into\nIreland, leaving his lady behind him in the house with his mother and\nsister, who, having also been averse to the match, had always looked\nupon her with eyes of disgust.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was not likely that harmony should long subsist in this family,\nespecially as Lady A-- was a woman of a lofty spirit, who could not\ntamely bear insults and ill-usage from persons who, she had reason to\nbelieve, were her enemies at heart. Accordingly, a misunderstanding\nsoon happened among them, which was fomented by the malice of one of her\nsisters-in-law. Divers scandalous reports of her misconduct, to which\nthe empty pretensions of a vain wretched coxcomb, who was made use of\nas an infamous tool for that purpose, gave a colourable pretext,\nwere trumped up, and transmitted, with many false and aggravating\ncircumstances, to her husband in Ireland; who, being a giddy, unthinking\nman, was so much incensed at these insinuations, that, in the first\ntransports of his passion, he sent to his mother a power of attorney,\nthat she might sue for a divorce in his behalf. A libel was thereupon\nexhibited, containing many scandalous allegations, void of any real\nfoundation in truth; but being unsupported by any manner of proof, it\nwas at length dismissed with costs, after it had depended upwards of two\nyears.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord A-- finding himself abused by the misrepresentations of his mother\nand sister, discovered an inclination to be reconciled to his lady. In\nconsequence of which, she was sent over to Dublin by her father, to the\ncare of a gentleman in that city; in whose house she was received by her\nhusband with all the demonstrations of love and esteem. From thence he\nconducted her to his lodgings, and thence to his country house, where\nshe had the misfortune to suffer a miscarriage, through fear and\nresentment of my lord's behaviour, which was often brutal and indecent.\nFrom the country they removed to Dublin, about the latter end of July,\nor beginning of August, 1714, where they had not long continued, when\nher ladyship was known to be again with child.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord A-- and his issue being next in remainder to the honours and\nestate of Arthur, earl of A--, was extremely solicitous to have a son;\nand, warned by the frequent miscarriages of his lady, resolved to curb\nthe natural impatience and rusticity of his disposition, that she might\nnot, as formerly, suffer by his outrageous conduct. He accordingly\ncherished her with uncommon tenderness and care; and her pregnancy being\npretty far advanced, conducted her to his country seat, where she was\ndelivered of Mr. A--, about the latter end of April, or beginning of\nMay; for none of the witnesses have been able, at this distance, with\nabsolute certainty to fix the precise time of his birth, and there\nwas no register kept in the parish. As an additional misfortune, no\ngentleman of fashion lived in that parish; nor did those who lived at\nany considerable distance care to cultivate an acquaintance with a man\nof Lord A--'s strange conduct.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe that as it will, the occasion was celebrated by his lordship's\ntenants and dependents upon the spot, and in the neighbouring town of\nNew-R--, by bonfires, illuminations, and other rejoicings; which have\nmade such an impression upon the minds of the people, that in the\nplace where they happened, and the contiguous parishes, several hundred\npersons have already declared their knowledge and remembrance of this\nevent, in spite of the great power of the claimant's adversary in\nthat quarter, and the great pains and indirect methods taken by his\nnumberless agents and emissaries, as well as by those who are interested\nwith him in the event of the suit, to corrupt and suppress the evidence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord A--, after the birth of his son, who was sent to nurse in the\nneighbourhood, according to the custom of the country, where people of\nthe highest distinction put their children out to nurse into farmhouses\nand cabins, lived in harmony with his lady for the space of two years.\nBut having, by his folly and extravagance, reduced himself to great\ndifficulties, he demanded the remainder of her fortune from her father,\nthe duke of B--, who absolutely refused to part with a shilling until a\nproper settlement should be made on his daughter, which, by that time,\nhe had put out of his own power to make, by his folly and extravagance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs her ladyship, by her endeavours to reform the economy of her house,\nhad incurred the displeasure of some idle profligate fellows, who\nhad fastened themselves upon her husband, and helped to consume his\nsubstance, they seized this opportunity of the duke's refusal; and, in\norder to be revenged upon the innocent lady, persuaded Lord A--, that\nthe only means of extracting money from his grace, would be to turn her\naway, on pretence of infidelity to his bed, for which they hinted there\nwas but too much foundation. At their suggestions, a most infamous\nplan was projected; in the execution of which, one P--, a poor, unbred,\nsimple country booby, whom they had decoyed into a snare, lost one of\nhis ears, and the injured lady retired that same day to New-R--, where\nshe continued several years. She did not, however, leave the house,\nwithout struggling hard to carry her child along with her; but far from\nenjoying such indulgence, strict orders were given, that the boy should\nnot, for the future, be brought within her sight. This base, inhuman\ntreatment, instead of answering the end proposed, produced such a\ncontrary effect, that the duke of B--, by a codicil to his will, in\nwhich he reflects upon Lord A--'s evil temper, directed his executors to\npay to his daughter an annuity of one hundred pounds, while her lord and\nshe should continue to live separate; and this allowance was to cease on\nLord A--'s death.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile she remained in this solitary situation, the child was\nuniversally known and received as the legitimate son and heir of her\nlord, whose affection for the boy was so conspicuous, that, in the midst\nof his own necessities, he never failed to maintain him in the dress and\nequipage of a young nobleman. In the course of his infancy, his father\nhaving often changed his place of residence, the child was put under\nthe instructions of a great many different schoolmasters, so that he was\nperfectly well known in a great many different parts of the kingdom; and\nhis mother seized all opportunities, which were but rare, on account of\nhis father's orders to the contrary, of seeing and giving him proofs\nof her maternal tenderness, until she set out for England, after having\nbeen long in a declining state of health, by a paralytical disorder;\nupon the consequence of which, such dependence was placed by her\ninconsiderate husband, who was by this time reduced to extreme poverty,\nthat he actually married a woman whom he had long kept as a mistress.\nThis creature no sooner understood that Lady A-- was departed from\nIreland, than she openly avowed her marriage, and went about publicly\nwith Lord A--, visiting his acquaintances in the character of his wife.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom this era may be dated the beginning of Mr. A--'s misfortune. This\nartful woman, who had formerly treated the child with an appearance of\nfondness, in order to ingratiate herself with the father, now looking\nupon herself as sufficiently established in the family, thought it was\nhigh time to alter her behaviour with regard to the unfortunate boy;\nand accordingly, for obvious reasons, employed a thousand artifices to\nalienate the heart of the weak father from his unhappy offspring.\nYet, notwithstanding all her insinuations, nature still maintained her\ninfluence in his heart; and though she often found means to irritate\nhim by artful and malicious accusations, his resentment never extended\nfarther than fatherly correction. She would have found it impossible\nto accomplish his ruin, had not her efforts been reinforced by a new\nauxiliary, who was no other than his uncle, the present usurper of\nhis title and estate; yet even this confederacy was overawed, in some\nmeasure, by the fear of alarming the unfortunate mother, until her\ndistemper increased to a most deplorable degree of the dead palsy, and\nthe death of her father had reduced her to a most forlorn and abject\nstate of distress. Then they ventured upon the execution of their\nprojects; and, though their aims were widely different, concurred in\ntheir endeavours to remove the hapless boy, as the common obstacle to\nboth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord A-- who, as I have already observed, was a man of weak intellects,\nand utterly void of any fixed principle of action, being by this time\nreduced to such a pitch of misery, that he was often obliged to pawn his\nwearing apparel in order to procure the common necessaries of life; and\nhaving no other fund remaining, with which he could relieve his present\nnecessities, except a sale of the reversion of the A-- estate, to\nwhich the nonage of his son was an effectual bar, he was advised by\nhis virtuous brother, and the rest of his counsellors, to surmount this\ndifficulty, by secreting his son, and spreading a report of his death.\nThis honest project he the more readily embraced, because he knew that\nno act of his could frustrate the child's succession. Accordingly, the\nboy was removed from the school at which he was then boarded, to the\nhouse of one K--, an agent and accomplice of the present earl of A--,\nwhere he was kept for several months closely confined; and, in the\nmeantime, it was industriously reported that he was dead.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis previous measure being taken, Lord A-- published advertisements\nin the gazettes, offering reversions of the A-- estate to sale; and\nemissaries of various kinds were employed to inveigle such as were\nignorant of the nature of the settlement of these estates, or strangers\nto the affairs of his family. Some people, imposed upon by the report of\nthe child's death, were drawn in to purchase, thinking themselves safe\nin the concurrence of his lordship's brother, upon presumption that\nhe was next in remainder to the succession; others, tempted by the\nsmallness of the price, which rarely exceeded half a year's purchase, as\nappears by many deeds, though they doubted the truth of the boy's being\ndead, ran small risks, on the contingency of his dying before he should\nbe of age, or in hopes of his being prevailed upon to confirm the grants\nof his father; and many more were treating with him on the same notions,\nwhen their transactions were suddenly interrupted, and the scheme\nof raising more money for the present, defeated by the unexpected\nappearance of the boy, who, being naturally sprightly and impatient of\nrestraint, had found means to break from his confinement, and wandered\nup and down the streets of Dublin, avoiding his father's house, and\nchoosing to encounter all sorts of distress, rather than subject himself\nagain to the cruelty and malice of the woman who supplied his mother's\nplace. Thus debarred his father's protection, and destitute of any fixed\nhabitation, he herded with all the loose, idle, and disorderly youths in\nDublin, skulking chiefly about the college, several members and students\nof which, taking pity on his misfortunes, supplied him at different\ntimes with clothes and money. In this unsettled and uncomfortable way\nof life did he remain, from the year 1725 to the latter end of November,\n1727; at which time his father died, so miserably poor, that he was\nactually buried at the public expense.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis unfortunate nobleman was no sooner dead, than his brother Richard,\nnow earl of A--, taking advantage of the nonage and helpless situation\nof his nephew, seized upon all the papers of the defunct, and afterwards\nusurped the title of Lord A--, to the surprise of the servants,\nand others who were acquainted with the affairs of the family. This\nusurpation, bold as it was, produced no other effect than that of his\nbeing insulted by the populace as he went through the streets, and the\nrefusal of the king-at-arms to enrol the certificate of his brother's\nhaving died without issue. The first of these inconveniences he bore\nwithout any sense of shame, though not without repining, conscious that\nit would gradually vanish with the novelty of his invasion; and as to\nthe last, he conquered it by means well known and obvious.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNor will it seem strange, that he should thus invade the rights of an\norphan with impunity, if people will consider, that the late Lord\nA-- had not only squandered away his fortune with the most ridiculous\nextravagance, but also associated himself with low company, so that he\nwas little known, and less regarded, by persons of any rank and figure\nin life; and his child, of consequence, debarred of the advantages\nwhich might have accrued from valuable connections. And though it was\nuniversally known, that Lady A-- had a son in Ireland, such was the\nobscurity in which the father had lived, during the last years of his\nlife, that few of the nobility could be supposed to be acquainted with\nthe particular circumstances of a transaction in which they had no\nconcern, and which had happened at the distance of twelve years before\nthe date of this usurpation. Moreover, as their first information was no\nother than common fame, the public clamour occasioned by the separation\nmight inspire such as were strangers to the family affairs with a\nmistaken notion of the child's having been born about or after the time\nof that event. The hurry and bustle occasioned by the arrival of the\nlord-lieutenant about this period, the reports industriously propagated\nof the claimant's death, the obscurity and concealment in which the boy\nwas obliged to live, in order to elude the wicked attempts of his uncle,\nmight also contribute to his peaceable enjoyment of an empty title. And\nlastly, Lord Chancellor W--, whose immediate province it was to issue\nwrits for parliament, was an utter stranger in Ireland, unacquainted\nwith the descents of families, and consequently did not examine farther\nthan the certificate enrolled in the books of the king-at-arms. Over and\nabove these circumstances, which naturally account for the success of\nthe imposture, it may be observed, that the hapless youth had not one\nrelation alive, on the side of his father, whose interest it was not to\nforward or connive at his destruction; that his grandfather, the duke\nof B--, was dead; and that his mother was then in England, in a forlorn,\ndestitute, dying condition, secreted from the world, and even from her\nown relations, by her woman Mary H--, who had a particular interest to\nsecrete her, and altogether dependent upon a miserable and precarious\nallowance from the duchess of B--, to whose caprice she was moreover a\nmost wretched slave.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNotwithstanding these concurring circumstances in favour of the\nusurper, he did not think himself secure while the orphan had any chance\nof finding a friend who would undertake his cause; and therefore laid\na plan for his being kidnapped, and sent to America as a slave. His\ncoadjutor in this inhuman scheme was a person who carried on the trade\nof transporting servants to our plantations, and was deeply interested\non this occasion, having, for a mere trifle, purchased of the late\nLord A--, the reversion of a considerable part of the A-- estate, which\nshameful bargain was confirmed by the brother, but could never take\nplace, unless the boy could be effectually removed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEverything being settled with this auxiliary, several ruffians were\nemployed in search of the unhappy victim; and the first attempt that was\nmade upon him, in which his uncle personally assisted, happening near\none of the great markets of the city of Dublin, an honest butcher, with\nthe assistance of his neighbours, rescued him by force from their cruel\nhands. This, however, was but a short respite; for, though warned by\nthis adventure, the boy seldom crept out of his lurking-places, without\nthe most cautious circumspection, he was, in March, 1727, discovered\nby the diligence of his persecutors, and forcibly dragged on board of\na ship bound for Newcastle, on Delaware river in America, where he\nwas sold as a slave, and kept to hard labour, much above his age\nor strength, for the space of thirteen years, during which he was\ntransferred from one person to another.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile he remained in this servile situation, he often mentioned,\nto those in whom he thought such confidence might be placed, the\ncircumstances of his birth and title, together with the manner of his\nbeing exiled from his native country, although, in this particular, he\nneglected a caution which he had received in his passage, importing that\nsuch a discovery would cost him his life. Meanwhile the usurper quietly\nenjoyed his right; and to those who questioned him about his brother's\nson, constantly replied, that the boy had been dead for several years.\nAnd Arthur, earl of A--, dying in April 1737, he, upon pretence of being\nnext heir, succeeded to the honours and estate of that nobleman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe term of the nephew's bondage, which had been lengthened out beyond\nthe usual time, on account of his repeated attempts to escape, being\nexpired in the year 1739, he hired himself as a common sailor in a\ntrading vessel bound to Jamaica; and there, being entered on board of\none of his majesty's ships under the command of Admiral Vernon, openly\ndeclared his parentage and pretensions. This extraordinary claim, which\nmade a great noise in the fleet, reaching the ears of one Lieutenant\nS--, nearly related to the usurper's Irish wife, he believed the young\ngentleman to be an impostor; and, thinking it was incumbent on him to\ndiscover the cheat, he went on board the ship to which the claimant\nbelonged, and, having heard the account which he gave of himself, was,\nnotwithstanding his prepossessions, convinced of the truth of what\nhe alleged. On his return to his own ship, he chanced to mention this\nextraordinary affair upon the quarter-deck, in the hearing of Mr. B--,\none of the midshipmen, who had formerly been at school with Mr. A--.\nThis young gentleman not only told the lieutenant, that he had been\nschool-fellow with Lord A--'s son, but also declared that he should know\nhim again, if not greatly altered, as he still retained a perfect idea\nof his countenance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon this intimation, the lieutenant proposed that the experiment\nshould be tried; and went with the midshipman on board the ship that\nthe claimant was on, for that purpose. After all the sailors had been\nassembled upon deck, Mr. B--, casting his eyes around, immediately\ndistinguished Mr. A-- in the crowd, and, laying his hand on his\nshoulder, 'This is the man,' said he; affirming, at the same time, that,\nwhile he continued at school with him, the claimant was reputed and\nrespected as Lord A--'s son and heir, and maintained in all respects\nsuitable to the dignity of his rank. Nay, he was, in like manner,\nrecognised by several other persons in the fleet, who had known him in\nhis infancy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese things being reported to the admiral, he generously ordered him\nto be supplied with necessaries, and treated like a gentleman; and, in\nhis next despatches, transmitted an account of the affair to the duke of\nNewcastle, among the other transactions of the fleet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn September or October, 1741, Mr. A-- arrived in London; and the first\nperson to whom he applied for advice and assistance was a man of the\nlaw, nearly related to the families of A-- and A--, and well acquainted\nwith the particular affairs of each; who, far from treating him as a\nbastard and impostor, received him with civility and seeming kindness,\nasked him to eat, presented him with a piece of money, and, excusing\nhimself from meddling in the affair, advised him to go to Ireland, as\nthe most proper place for commencing a suit for the recovery of his\nright.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBefore the young gentleman had an opportunity, or indeed any\ninclination, to comply with this advice, he was accidentally met in\nthe street by that same H--, who, as I have mentioned, gave Mr. M-- the\nfirst insight into the affair. This man immediately knew the claimant,\nhaving been formerly an agent for his father, and afterwards a creature\nof his uncle's, with whom he was, not without reason, suspected to be\nconcerned in kidnapping and transporting his nephew. Be that as it will,\nhis connections with the usurper were now broken off by a quarrel, in\nconsequence of which he had thrown up his agency; and he invited the\nhapless stranger to his house, with a view of making all possible\nadvantage of such a guest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere he had not long remained, when his treacherous landlord,\ntampering with his inexperience, effected a marriage between him and the\ndaughter of one of his own friends, who lodged in his house at the same\ntime. But afterwards, seeing no person of consequence willing to espouse\nhis cause, he looked upon him as an encumbrance, and wanted to rid\nhis hands of him accordingly. He remembered that Mr. M-- had expressed\nhimself with all the humanity of apprehension in favour of the\nunfortunate young nobleman, before his arrival in England; and, being\nwell acquainted with the generosity of his disposition, he no sooner\nunderstood that he was returned from France, than he waited upon him\nwith an account of Mr. A--'s being safely arrived. Mr. M-- was sincerely\nrejoiced to find, that a person who had been so cruelly injured, and\nundergone so long and continued a scene of distress, was restored to\na country where he was sure of obtaining justice, and where every good\nman, as he imagined, would make the cause his own. And being informed\nthat the youth was in want of necessaries, he gave twenty guineas to H--\nfor his use, and promised to do him all the service in his power;\nbut had no intention to take upon himself the whole weight of such an\nimportant affair, or indeed to appear in the cause, until he should be\nfully and thoroughly satisfied that the claimant's pretensions were well\nfounded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the meantime, H-- insinuating that the young gentleman was not\nsafe in his present lodging from the machinations of his enemies, M--\naccommodated him with an apartment in his own house; where he was at\ngreat pains to remedy the defect in his education, by rendering him fit\nto appear as a gentleman in the world. Having received from him all the\nintelligence he could give relating to his own affair, he laid the case\nbefore counsel, and despatched a person to Ireland, to make further\ninquiries upon the same subject; who, in his first arrival in that\nkingdom, found the claimant's birth was as publicly known as any\ncircumstance of that kind could possibly be, at so great a distance of\ntime.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe usurper and his friends gave all the interruption in their power to\nany researches concerning that affair; and had recourse to every art\nand expedient that could be invented, to prevent its being brought to\na legal discussion. Privilege, bills in chancery, orders of court\nsurreptitiously and illegally obtained, and every other invention was\nmade use of to bar and prevent a fair and honest trial by a jury. The\nusurper himself, and his agents, at the same time that they formed\ndivers conspiracies against his life, in vain endeavoured to detach\nMr. M-- from the orphan's cause, by innumerable artifices, insinuating,\ncajoling, and misrepresenting, with surprising dexterity and\nperseverance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis protector, far from being satisfied with their reasons, was not\nonly deaf to their remonstrances, but, believing him in danger from\ntheir repeated efforts, had him privately conveyed into the country;\nwhere an unhappy accident, which he hath ever since sincerely regretted,\nfurnished his adversary with a colourable pretext to cut him off in the\nbeginning of his career.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA man happening to lose his life by the accidental discharge of a piece\nthat chanced to be in a young gentleman's hands, the account of this\nmisfortune no sooner reached the ears of his uncle, than he expressed\nthe most immoderate joy at having found so good a handle for destroying\nhim, under colour of law. He immediately constituted himself prosecutor,\nset his emissaries at work to secure a coroner's inquest suited to his\ncruel purposes; set out for the place in person, to take care that the\nprisoner should not escape; insulted him in jail, in the most inhuman\nmanner; employed a whole army of attorneys and agents, to spirit up and\ncarry on a most virulent prosecution; practised all the unfair methods\nthat could be invented, in order that the unhappy gentleman should be\ntransported to Newgate, from the healthy prison to which he was at first\ncommitted; endeavoured to inveigle him into destructive confessions;\nand, not to mention other more infamous arts employed in the affair of\nevidence, attempted to surprise him upon his trial in the absence of\nhis witnesses and counsel, contrary to a previous agreement with the\nprosecutor's own attorney. Nay, he even appeared in person upon the\nbench at the trial, in order to intimidate the evidence, and browbeat\nthe unfortunate prisoner at the bar, and expended above a thousand\npounds in that prosecution. In spite of all his wicked efforts, however,\nwhich were defeated by the spirit and indefatigable industry of Mr.\nM--, the young gentleman was honourably acquitted, to the evident\nsatisfaction of all the impartial; the misfortune, that gave a handle\nfor that unnatural prosecution, appearing to a demonstration to have\nbeen a mere accident.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn a few months, his protector, who had now openly espoused his cause,\ntaking with him two gentlemen to witness his transactions, conducted him\nto his native country, with a view to be better informed of the strength\nof his pretensions, than he could be by the intelligence he had\nhitherto received, or by the claimant's own dark and almost obliterated\nremembrance of the facts which were essential to be known. Upon their\narrival in Dublin, application was made to those persons whom Mr.\nA-- had named as his schoolmasters and companions, together with\nthe servants and neighbours of his father. These, though examined\nseparately, without having the least previous intimation of what the\nclaimant had reported, agreed in their accounts with him, as well as\nwith one another, and mentioned many other people as acquainted with the\nsame facts, to whom Mr. M-- had recourse, and still met with the same\nunvaried information. By these means, he made such progress in his\ninquiries, that, in less than two months, no fewer than one hundred\npersons, from different quarters of the kingdom, either personally,\nor by letters, communicated their knowledge of the claimant, in\ndeclarations consonant with one another, as well as with the accounts\nhe gave of himself. Several servants who had lived with his father, and\nbeen deceived with the story of his death, so industriously propagated\nby his uncle, no sooner heard of his being in Dublin, than they came\nfrom different parts of the country to see him; and though great pains\nwere taken to deceive them, they, nevertheless, knew him at first\nsight; some of them fell upon their knees to thank for his preservation,\nembraced his legs, and shed tears of joy for his return.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlthough the conduct of his adversary, particularly in the\nabove-mentioned prosecution, together with the evidence that already\nappeared, were sufficient to convince all mankind of the truth of the\nclaimant's pretensions, Mr. M--, in order to be further satisfied,\nresolved to see how he would be received upon the spot where he was\nborn; justly concluding, that if he was really an impostor, the bastard\nof a kitchen-wench, produced in a country entirely possessed by his\nenemy and his allies, he must be looked upon in that place with the\nutmost detestation and contempt.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis his intention was no sooner known to the adverse party, than their\nagents and friends from all quarters repaired to that place with all\npossible despatch, and used all their influence with the people, in\nremonstrances, threats, and all the other arts they could devise, not\nonly to discountenance the claimant upon his arrival, but even to spirit\nup a mob to insult him. Notwithstanding these precautions, and the\nservile awe and subjection in which tenants are kept by their landlords\nin that part of the country, as soon as it was known that Mr. A--\napproached the town, the inhabitants crowded out in great multitudes\nto receive and welcome him, and accompanied him into town, with\nacclamations, and other expressions of joy, insomuch that the agents\nof his adversary durst not show their faces. The sovereign of the\ncorporation, who was a particular creature and favourite of the usurper,\nand whose all depended upon the issue of the cause, was so conscious of\nthe stranger's right, and so much awed by the behaviour of the people,\nwho knew that consciousness, that he did not think it safe even to\npreserve the appearance of neutrality upon this occasion, but actually\nheld the stirrup while Mr. A-- dismounted from his horse.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis sense of conviction in the people manifested itself still more\npowerfully when he returned to the same place in the year 1744, about\nwhich time Lord A-- being informed of his resolution, determined again\nto be beforehand with him, and set out in person, with his agents\nand friends, some of whom were detached before him to prepare for his\nreception, and induced the people to meet him in a body, and accompany\nhim to town, with such expressions of welcome as they had before\nbestowed on his nephew; but, in spite of all their art and interest,\nhe was suffered to pass through the street in a mournful silence; and\nthough several barrels of beer were produced to court the favour of the\npopulace, they had no other effect than that of drawing their ridicule\nupon the donor, whereas, when Mr. A--, two days afterwards, appeared,\nall the inhabitants, with garlands, streamers, music, and other ensigns\nof joy, crowded out to meet him, and ushered him into town with such\ndemonstrations of pleasure and goodwill, that the noble peer found it\nconvenient to hide himself from the resentment of his own tenants, the\neffects of which he must have severely felt, had not he been screened\nby the timely remonstrances of Mr. M--, and the other gentlemen who\naccompanied his competitor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNor did his apprehension vanish with the transaction of this day; the\ntown was again in uproar on the Sunday following, when it was known that\nMr. A-- intended to come thither from Dunmain to church; they went\nout to meet him as before, and conducted him to the church door with\nacclamations, which terrified his uncle to such a degree, that he fled\nwith precipitation in a boat, and soon after entirely quitted the place.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would be almost an endless task to enumerate the particular steps\nthat were taken by one side to promote, and by the other to delay, the\ntrial. The young gentleman's adversaries finding that they could not, by\nall the subterfuges and arts they had used, evade it, repeated attempts\nwere made to assassinate him and his protector; and every obstruction\nthrown in the way of his cause which craft could invent, villainy\nexecute, and undue influence confirm. But all these difficulties were\nsurmounted by the vigilance, constancy, courage, and sagacity of M--;\nand, at last, the affair was brought to a very solemn trial at bar,\nwhich being continued, by several adjournments, from the eleventh to the\ntwenty-fifth day of November, a verdict was found for the claimant by a\njury of gentlemen, which, in point of reputation and property, cannot\nbe easily paralleled in the annals of that or any other country; a jury,\nthat could by no means be suspected of prepossessions in favour of Mr.\nA--, to whose person they were absolute strangers; especially if we\nconsider, that a gentleman in their neighbourhood, who was nephew to\nthe foreman, and nearly related to some of the rest of their number,\nforfeited a considerable estate by their decision.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis verdict,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the parson, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgave the highest satisfaction to all\nimpartial persons that were within reach of being duly informed of their\nproceedings, and of the different genius and conduct of the parties\nengaged in the contest, but more especially to such as were in court, as\nI was, at the trial, and had an opportunity of observing the characters\nand behaviour of the persons who appeared there to give evidence. To\nsuch it was very apparent, that all the witnesses produced there on the\npart of the uncle, were either his tenants, dependents, pot-companions,\nor persons some way or other interested in the issue of the suit, and\nremarkable for a low kind of cunning; that many of them were persons\nof profligate lives, who deserved no credit; that, independent of\nthe levity of their characters, those of them who went under the\ndenomination of colonels, Colonel L-- alone excepted, who had nothing to\nsay, and was only brought there in order to give credit to that party,\nmade so ridiculous a figure, and gave so absurd, contradictory, and\ninconsistent an evidence, as no court or jury could give the least\ndegree of credit to. On the other hand, it was observed, that the\nnephew and Mr. M--, his chief manager, being absolute strangers in that\ncountry, and unacquainted with the characters of the persons they had to\ndeal with, were obliged to lay before the court and jury such evidence\nas came to their hand, some of whom plainly appeared to have been\nput upon them by their adversaries with a design to hurt. It was also\nmanifest, that the witnesses produced for Mr. A--, were such as could\nhave no manner of connection with him, nor any dependence whatsoever\nupon him, to influence their evidence; for the far greatest part of them\nhad never seen him from his infancy till the trial began; and many of\nthem, though poor, and undignified with the title of colonels, were\npeople of unblemished character, of great simplicity, and such as no man\nin his senses would pitch upon to support a bad cause. It is plain that\nthe jury, whose well-known honour, impartiality, and penetration, must\nbe revered by all who are acquainted with them, were not under the least\ndifficulty about their verdict; for they were not enclosed above half\nan hour, when they returned with it. These gentlemen could not help\nobserving the great inequality of the parties engaged, the great\nadvantages that the uncle had in every other respect, except the\ntruth and justice of his case, over the nephew, by means of his vast\npossessions, and of his power and influence all round the place of his\nbirth; nor could the contrast between the different geniuses of the two\nparties escape their observation. They could not but see and conclude,\nthat a person who had confessedly transported and sold his orphan nephew\ninto slavery,--who, on his return, had carried on so unwarrantable and\ncruel a prosecution to take away his life under colour of law,--and who\nhad also given such glaring proofs of his skill and dexterity in the\nmanagement of witnesses for that cruel purpose,--was in like manner\ncapable of exerting the same happy talent on this occasion, when his all\nwas at stake; more especially, as he had so many others who were equally\ninterested with himself, and whose abilities in that respect fell\nnothing short of his own, to second him in it. The gentlemen of the\njury had also a near view of the manner in which the witnesses delivered\ntheir testimonies, and had from thence an opportunity of observing\nmany circumstances, and distinguishing characteristics of truth and\nfalsehood, from which a great deal could be gathered, that could not\nbe adequately conveyed by any printed account, how exact soever;\nconsequently, they must have been much better judges of the evidence on\nwhich they founded their verdict than any person who had not the same\nopportunity, can possibly be.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese, Mr. Pickle, were my reflections on what I had occasion to\nobserve concerning that famous trial; and, on my return to England\ntwo years after, I could not help pitying the self-sufficiency of some\npeople, who, at this distance, pretended to pass their judgment on that\nverdict with as great positiveness as if they had been in the secrets\nof the cause, or upon the jury who tried it; and that from no better\nauthority than the declamations of Lord A--'s emissaries, and some\nfalsified printed accounts, artfully cooked up on purpose to mislead and\ndeceive.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut to return from this digression. Lord A--, the defendant in that\ncause, was so conscious of the strength and merits of his injured\nnephew's case, and that a verdict would go against him, that he ordered\na writ of error to be made out before the trial was ended; and the\nverdict was no sooner given, than he immediately lodged it, though\nhe well knew he had no manner of error to assign. This expedient was\npractised merely for vexation and delay, in order to keep Mr. A-- from\nthe possession of the small estate he had recovered by the verdict,\nthat, his slender funds being exhausted, he might be deprived of other\nmeans to prosecute his right; and by the most oppressive contrivances\nand scandalous chicanery, it has been kept up to this day, without his\nbeing able to assign the least shadow of any error.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord A-- was not the only antagonist that Mr. A-- had to deal with;\nall the different branches of the A-- family, who had been worrying one\nanother at law ever since the death of the late earl of A--, about the\npartition of his great estate, were now firmly united in an association\nagainst this unfortunate gentleman; mutual deeds were executed among\nthem, by which many great lordships and estates were given up by the\nuncle to persons who had no right to possess them, in order to engage\nthem to side with him against his nephew, in withholding the unjust\npossession of the remainder.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese confederates having held several consultations against their\ncommon enemy, and finding that his cause gathered daily strength since\nthe trial, by the accession of many witnesses of figure and reputation,\nwho had not been heard of before, and that the only chance they had\nto prevent the speedy establishment of his right, and their own\ndestruction, was by stripping Mr. M-- of the little money that yet\nremained, and by stopping all further resources whereby he might be\nenabled to proceed; they therefore came to a determined resolution to\ncarry that hopeful scheme into execution; and, in pursuance thereof,\nthey have left no expedient or stratagem, how extraordinary or\nscandalous soever, unpractised, to distress Mr. A-- and that\ngentleman. For that end, all the oppressive arts and dilatory expensive\ncontrivances that the fertile invention of the lowest pettifoggers\nof the law could possibly devise, have with dexterity been played off\nagainst them, in fruitless quibbling, and malicious suits, entirely\nforeign to the merits of the cause. Not to mention numberless other acts\nof oppression, the most extraordinary and unprecedented proceeding, by\nmeans whereof this sham writ of error hath been kept on foot ever since\nNovember, 1743, is to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca most flagrant instance\nnot only of the prevalency of power and money, when employed, as in the\npresent case, against an unfortunate helpless man, disabled, as he is,\nof the means of ascertaining his right, but of the badness of a cause\nthat hath recourse to so many iniquitous expedients to support it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn a word, the whole conduct of Lord A-- and his party, from the\nbeginning to this time, hath been such as sufficiently manifests that\nit could proceed from no other motives than a consciousness of Mr.\nA--'s right, and of their own illegal usurpations, and from a terror of\ntrusting the merits of their case to a fair discussion by the laws\nof their country; and that the intention and main drift of all their\nproceedings plainly tends to stifle and smother the merits of the\ncase from the knowledge of the world, by oppressive arts and ingenious\ndelays, rather than trust it to the candid determination of an honest\njury. What else could be the motives of kidnapping the claimant, and\ntransporting him when an infant? of the various attempts made upon his\nlife since his return? of the attempts to divest him of all assistance\nto ascertain his right, by endeavouring so solicitously to prevail on\nMr. M-- to abandon him in the beginning? of retaining an army of counsel\nbefore any suit had been commenced? of the many sinister attempts to\nprevent the trial at bar? of the various arts made use of to terrify any\none from appearing as witness for the claimant, and to seduce those who\nhad appeared? of the shameless, unprecedented, low tricks now practised,\nto keep him out of the possession of that estate for which he had\nobtained the verdict, thereby to disable him from bringing his cause to\na further hearing; and of the attempts made to buy up Mr. M--'s debts,\nand to spirit up suits against him? Is it not obvious from all these\ncircumstances, as well as from the obstruction they have given to the\nattorney-general's proceeding to make a report to his majesty on the\nclaimant's petition to the king for the peerage, which was referred\nby his majesty to that gentleman, so far back as 1743, that all their\nefforts are bent to that one point, of stifling, rather than suffering\nthe merits of this cause to come to a fair and candid hearing; and that\nthe sole consideration at present between them and this unfortunate man\nis not whether he is right or wrong, but whether he shall or shall not\nfind money to bring this cause to a final determination?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord A-- and his confederates, not thinking themselves safe with all\nthese expedients, while there was a possibility of their antagonist's\nobtaining any assistance from such as humanity, compassion, generosity,\nor a love of justice, might induce to lay open their purses to his\nassistance in ascertaining his right, have, by themselves and their\nnumerous emissaries, employed all the arts of calumny, slander, and\ndetraction against him, by traducing his cause, vilifying his person,\nand most basely and cruelly tearing his character to pieces, by a\nthousand misrepresentations, purposely invented and industriously\npropagated in all places of resort, which is a kind of cowardly\nassassination that there is no guarding against; yet, in spite of all\nthese machinations, and the shameful indifference of mankind, who\nstand aloof unconcerned, and see this unhappy gentleman most inhumanly\noppressed by the weight of lawless power and faction, M--, far from\nsuffering himself to be dejected by the multiplying difficulties\nthat crowd upon him, still exerts himself with amazing fortitude and\nassiduity, and will, I doubt not, bring the affair he began and\ncarried on with so much spirit, while his finances lasted, to a happy\nconclusion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would exceed the bounds of my intention, and, perhaps, trespass too\nmuch upon your time, were I to enumerate the low artifices and shameful\nquibbles by which the usurper has found means to procrastinate the\ndecision of the contest between him and his hapless nephew, or to give\na detail of the damage and perplexity which Mr. M-- has sustained, and\nbeen involved in, by the treachery and ingratitude of some who listed\nthemselves under him in the prosecution of this affair; and by the\nvillainy of others, who, under various pretences of material discoveries\nthey had to make, etc., had fastened themselves upon him, and continued\nto do all the mischief in their power, until the cloven foot was\ndetected.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne instance, however, is so flagrantly flagitious, that I cannot\nresist the inclination I feel to relate it, as an example of the most\ninfernal perfidy that perhaps ever entered the human heart. I have\nalready mentioned the part which H--n acted in the beginning of M--'s\nconnection with the unfortunate stranger, and hinted that the said H--\nlay under many obligations to that gentleman before Mr. A--'s arrival\nin England. He had been chief agent to Lord A--, and, as it afterwards\nappeared, received several payments of a secret pension which that\nlord enjoyed, for which he either could not or would not account.\nHis lordship, therefore, in order to compel him to it, took out writs\nagainst him, and his house was continually surrounded with catchpoles\nfor the space of two whole years.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. M-- believing, from H--'s own account of the matter, that the poor\nman was greatly injured, and prosecuted on account of his attachment to\nthe unhappy young gentleman, did him all the good offices in his power,\nand became security for him on several occasions; nay, such was his\nopinion of his integrity, that, after Mr. A-- was cleared of the\nprosecution carried on against him by his uncle, his person was\nentrusted to the care of this hypocrite, who desired that the young\ngentleman might lodge at his house for the convenience of air, M--'s own\noccasions calling him often into the country.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving thus, by his consummate dissimulation, acquired such a valuable\ncharge, he wrote a letter to one of Lord A--'s attorneys, offering to\nbetray Mr. A--, provided his lordship would settle his account, and give\nhim a discharge for eight hundred pounds of the pension which he had\nreceived and not accounted for. Mr. M--, informed of this treacherous\nproposal, immediately removed his lodger from his house into his own,\nwithout assigning his reasons for so doing, until he was obliged to\ndeclare it, in order to free himself from the importunities of H--, who\nearnestly solicited his return. This miscreant finding himself detected\nand disappointed in his villainous design, was so much enraged at his\nmiscarriage, that, forgetting all the benefits he had received from M--\nfor a series of years, he practised all the mischief that his malice\ncould contrive against him; and at length entered into a confederacy\nwith one G--, and several other abandoned wretches, who, as before said,\nunder various pretences of being able to make material discoveries, and\notherwise to serve the cause, had found means to be employed in some\nextra business relating to it, though their real intention was to betray\nthe claimant.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese confederates, in conjunction with some other auxiliaries of\ninfamous character, being informed that Mr. M-- was on the point of\nsecuring a considerable sum, to enable him to prosecute Mr. A--'s right,\nand to bring it to a happy conclusion, contrived a deep-laid scheme\nto disappoint him in it, and at once to ruin the cause. And, previous\nmeasures being taken for that wicked purpose, they imposed upon the\nyoung gentleman's inexperience and credulity by insinuations equally\nfalse, plausible, and malicious; to which they at length gained his\nbelief, by the mention of some circumstances that gave what they alleged\nan air of probability, and even of truth. They swore that Mr. M-- had\ntaken out an action against him for a very large sum of money; that they\nhad actually seen the writ; that the intention of it was to throw him\ninto prison for life, and ruin his cause, in consequence of an agreement\nmade by him with Lord A--, and his other enemies, to retrieve the money\nthat he had laid out in the cause.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis plausible tale was enforced with such an air of truth, candour,\nand earnest concern for his safety, and was strengthened by so many\nimprecations and corroborating circumstances of their invention, as\nwould have staggered one of much greater experience and knowledge of\nmankind than Mr. A-- could be supposed at that time to possess. The\nnotion of perpetual imprisonment, and the certain ruin they made him\nbelieve his cause was threatened with, worked upon his imagination to\nsuch a degree, that he suffered himself to be led like a lamb to the\nslaughter by this artful band of villains, who secreted him at the\nlodgings of one P--, an intimate of G--'s, for several days, under\ncolour of his being hunted by bailiffs employed by Mr. M--, where he was\nnot only obliged by them to change his name, but even his wife was not\nsuffered to have access to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTheir design was to have sold him, or drawn him into a ruinous\ncompromise with his adversaries, for a valuable consideration to\nthemselves. But as no ties are binding among such a knot of villains,\nthe rest of the conspirators were jockeyed by G--, who, in order to\nmonopolize the advantage to himself, hurried his prize into the country,\nand secreted him even from his confederates, in a place of concealment\none hundred miles from London, under the same ridiculous pretence of\nM--'s having taken out a writ against him, and of bailiffs being in\npursuit of him everywhere round London.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was no sooner there, than G--, as a previous step to the other\nvillainy he intended, tricked him out of a bond for six thousand pounds,\nunder colour of his having a person ready to advance the like sum upon\nit, as an immediate fund for carrying on his cause; assuring him, at\nthe same time, that he had a set of gentlemen ready, who were willing\nto advance twenty-five thousand pounds more for the same purpose, and to\nallow him five hundred pounds a year for his maintenance, till his cause\nshould be made an end of, provided that Mr. M-- should have no further\nconcern with him and his cause.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. A--, having by this time received some intimations of the deceit\nthat had been put upon him, made answer, that he should look upon\nhimself as a very ungrateful monster indeed, if he deserted a person who\nhad saved his life, and so generously ventured his own, together with\nhis fortune, in his cause, until he should first be certain of the truth\nof what was alleged of him, and absolutely rejected the proposal. G--,\nwho had no other view in making it, than to cover the secret villainy he\nmeditated against him, and to facilitate the execution thereof, easily\nreceded from it, when he found Mr. A-- so averse to it, and undertook\nnevertheless to raise the money, adding, that he might, if he pleased,\nreturn to Mr. M-- whenever it was secured. The whole drift of this\npretended undertaking to raise the twenty-five thousand pounds, was only\nto lay a foundation for a dexterous contrivance to draw Mr. A-- unwarily\ninto the execution of a deed, relinquishing all his right and title,\nunder a notion of its being a deed to secure the repayment of that sum.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cG-- having, as he imagined, so far paved the way for the execution of\nsuch a deed, enters into an agreement with an agent, employed for that\npurpose by Mr. A--'s adversaries, purporting that in consideration of\nthe payment of a bond for six thousand pounds, which he, G--, had, as\nhe pretended, laid out in Mr. A--'s cause, and of an annuity of seven\nhundred pounds a year, he was to procure for them from Mr. A-- a deed\nready executed, relinquishing all right and title to the A-- estate and\nhonours. Everything being prepared for the execution of this infernal\nscheme, unknown to Mr. A--, G-- then thought proper to send for him\nto town from his retirement, in order, as he pretended, to execute a\nsecurity of twenty-five thousand pounds.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis intended victim to that villain's avarice no sooner arrived in\ntown, full of hopes of money to carry on his cause, and of agreeably\nsurprising his friend and protector Mr. M--, with so seasonable and\nunexpected a reinforcement, than an unforeseen difficulty arose,\nconcerning the payment of G--'s six-thousand-pound bond. That money was\nto have been raised out of the estate of a lunatic, which could not be\ndone without the leave of the Court of Chancery, to whom an account must\nhave been given of the intended application of it. While preparations\nwere making to rectify this omission, G-- immediately carried Mr. A--\nagain into the country, lest he should happen to be undeceived by some\nmeans or other.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the meantime, this wicked machination was providentially discovered\nby Mr. M--, before it could be carried into execution, by means of the\njealousies that arose among the conspirators themselves; and was, at the\nsame time, confirmed to him by a person whom the very agent for the A--\nparty had entrusted with the secret. M-- no sooner detected it, than he\ncommunicated his discovery to one of Mr. A--'s counsel, a man of great\nworth, and immediately thereupon took proper measures to defeat it. He\nthen found means to lay open to Mr. A-- himself the treacherous scheme\nthat was laid for his destruction. He was highly sensible of it, and\ncould never afterwards reflect on the snare that he had so unwarily been\ndrawn into, and had so narrowly escaped, without a mixture of horror,\nshame, and gratitude to his deliverer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe consummate assurance of the monsters who were engaged in this plot,\nafter they had been detected, and upbraided with their treachery, is\nscarce to be paralleled; for they not only owned the fact of spiriting\nMr. A-- away in the manner above mentioned, but justified their doing it\nas tending to his service. They also maintained, that they had actually\nsecured the twenty-five thousand pounds for him, though they never could\nname any one person who was to have advanced the money. No man was more\nactive in this scheme than H--, nor any man more solicitous to keep\nMr. A-- up in the false impressions he had received, or in projecting\nmethods to ruin his protector, than he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmong many other expedients for that purpose, a most malicious attempt\nwas made to lodge an information against him, for treasonable practices,\nwith the secretary of state, notwithstanding the repeated proofs he had\ngiven of his loyalty; and, as a preparatory step to his accusation, a\nletter, which this traitor dictated, was copied by another person, and\nactually sent to the earl of C--, importing, that the person who copied\nthe letter had an affair of consequence to communicate to his lordship,\nif he would appoint a time of receiving the information. But that\nperson, upon full conviction of the villainy of the scheme, absolutely\nrefused to proceed further in it; so that his malice once more proved\nabortive; and before he had time to execute any other contrivance of the\nsame nature, he was imprisoned in this very jail for debt.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere, finding his creditors inexorable, and himself destitute of all\nother resource, he made application to the very man whom he had injured\nin such an outrageous manner, set forth his deplorable case in the most\npathetic terms, and entreated him, with the most abject humility, to\nuse his influence in his behalf. The distress of this varlet immediately\ndisarmed M-- of his resentment, and even excited his compassion. Without\nsending any answer to his remonstrances, he interceded for him with his\ncreditors; and the person to whom he was chiefly indebted, refusing to\nrelease him without security, this unwearied benefactor joined with the\nprisoner in a bond for above two hundred and forty pounds, for which he\nobtained his release.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was no sooner discharged, however, than he entered into fresh\ncombinations with G-- and others, in order to thwart his deliverer in\nhis schemes of raising money, and otherwise to distress and deprive him\nof liberty; for which purpose, no art or industry, perjury not excepted,\nhath been spared. And, what is still more extraordinary, this perfidious\nmonster having found money to take up the bond, in consequence of which\nhe regained his freedom, hath procured a writ against M--, upon that\nvery obligation; and taken assignments to some other debts of that\ngentleman, with the same Christian intention. But hitherto he hath, by\nsurprising sagacity and unshaken resolution, baffled all their infernal\ncontrivances, and retorted some of their machinations on their own\nheads. At this time, when he is supposed by some, and represented by\nothers, as under the circumstances of oblivion and despondence, he\nproceeds in his design with the utmost calmness and intrepidity,\nmeditating schemes, and ripening measures, that will one day confound\nhis enemies, and attract the notice and admiration of mankind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPeregrine, having thanked the priest for his obliging information,\nexpressed his surprise at the scandalous inattention of the world to\nan affair of such importance; observing, that, by such inhuman neglect,\nthis unfortunate young gentleman, Mr. A--, was absolutely deprived of\nall the benefit of society; the sole end of which is, to protect\nthe rights, redress the grievances, and promote the happiness\nof individuals. As for the character of M--, he said, it was so\nromantically singular in all its circumstances, that, though other\nmotives were wanting, curiosity alone would induce him to seek his\nacquaintance. But he did not at all wonder at the ungrateful returns\nwhich had been made to his generosity by H-- and many others, whom he\nhad served in a manner that few, besides himself, would have done; for\nhe had been long convinced of the truth conveyed in these lines of a\ncelebrated Italian author:--\n\nLi beneficii che, per la loro grandezza, non ponno esser guiderdonati,\ncon la scelerata moneta dell' ingratitudine sono pagati.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe story which you have related of that young gentleman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbears a very strong resemblance to the fate of a Spanish nobleman, as\nit was communicated to me by one of his own intimate friends at Paris.\nThe Countess d'Alvarez died immediately after the birth of a son, and\nthe husband surviving her but three years, the child was left sole heir\nto the honours and estate, under the guardianship of his uncle, who\nhad a small fortune and a great many children. This inhuman relation,\ncoveting the wealth of his infant ward, formed a design against the\nlife of the helpless orphan, and trusted the execution of it to his\nvalet-de-chambre, who was tempted to undertake the murder by the promise\nof a considerable reward. He accordingly stabbed the boy with a knife\nin three different places, on the right side of his neck; but, as he was\nnot used to such barbarous attempts, his hand failed in the performance;\nand he was seized with such remorse, that, perceiving the wounds were\nnot mortal, he carried the hapless victim to the house of a surgeon,\nby whose care they were healed; and, in the meantime, that he might not\nforfeit his recompense, found means to persuade his employer, that\nhis orders were performed. A bundle being made up for the purpose, was\npublicly interred as the body of the child, who was said to have been\nsuddenly carried off by a convulsion; and the uncle, without opposition,\nsucceeded to his honours and estate. The boy being cured of his hurts,\nwas, about the age of six, delivered, with a small sum of money, to a\nmerchant just embarking for Turkey; who was given to understand, that he\nwas the bastard of a man of quality and that for family reasons, it was\nnecessary to conceal his birth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile the unfortunate orphan remained in this deplorable state of\nbondage, all the children of the usurper died one after another; and he\nhimself being taken dangerously ill, attributed all his afflictions to\nthe just judgment of God, and communicated his anxiety on that subject\nto the valet-de-chambre, who had been employed in the murder of his\nnephew. That domestic, in order to quiet his master's conscience, and\ncalm the perturbation of his spirits, confessed what he had done, and\ngave him hopes of still finding the boy by dint of industry and expense.\nThe unhappy child being the only hope of the family of Alvarez, the\nuncle immediately ordered a minute inquiry to be set on foot; in\nconsequence of which he was informed, that the orphan had been sold to a\nTurk, who had afterwards transferred him to an English merchant, by whom\nhe was conveyed to London.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAn express was immediately despatched to this capital, where he\nunderstood that the unhappy exile had, in consideration of his faithful\nservices, been bound apprentice to a French barber-surgeon; and, after\nhe had sufficiently qualified himself in that profession, been received\ninto the family of the Count de Gallas, at that time the emperor's\nambassador at the court of London. From the house of this nobleman he\nwas traced into the service of Count d'Oberstorf, where he had married\nhis lady's chambermaid, and then gone to settle as a surgeon in Bohemia.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the course of these inquiries, several years elapsed: his uncle, who\nwas very much attached to the house of Austria, lived at Barcelona when\nthe father of this empress-queen resided in that city, and lent him a\nvery considerable sum of money in the most pressing emergency of his\naffairs; and when that prince was on the point of returning to Germany,\nthe old count, finding his end approaching, sent his father confessor\nto his majesty, with a circumstantial account of the barbarity he had\npractised against his nephew, for which he implored forgiveness, and\nbegged he would give orders, that the orphan, when found, should inherit\nthe dignities and fortune which he had unjustly usurped.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis majesty assured the old man, that he might make himself easy\non that score, and ordered the confessor to follow him to Vienna,\nimmediately after the count's death, in order to assist his endeavours\nin finding out the injured heir. The priest did not fail to yield\nobedience to this command. He informed himself of certain natural marks\non the young count's body, which were known to the nurse and women who\nattended him in his infancy; and, with a gentleman whom the emperor\nordered to accompany him, set out for Bohemia, where he soon found the\nobject of his inquiry, in the capacity of major-domo to a nobleman\nof that country, he having quitted his profession of surgery for that\noffice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was not a little surprised, when he found himself circumstantially\ncatechised about the particulars of his life, by persons commissioned\nfor that purpose by the emperor. He told them, that he was absolutely\nignorant of his own birth, though he had been informed, during his\nresidence in Turkey, that he was the bastard of a Spanish grandee,\nand gave them a minute detail of the pilgrimage he had undergone. This\ninformation agreeing with the intelligence which the priest had already\nreceived, and being corroborated by the marks upon his body, and the\nvery scars of the wounds which had been inflicted upon him in his\ninfancy, the confessor, without further hesitation, saluted him by\nthe name of Count d'Alvarez, grandee of Spain, and explained the whole\nmystery of his fortune.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf he was agreeably amazed at this explanation, the case was otherwise\nwith his wife, who thought herself in great danger of being abandoned\nby a husband of such high rank; but he immediately dispelled her\napprehension, by assuring her, that, as she had shared in his adversity,\nshe should also partake of his good fortune. He set out immediately for\nVienna, to make his acknowledgments to the emperor, who favoured him\nwith a very gracious reception, promised to use his influence, so that\nhe might enjoy the honours and estate of his family; and in the meantime\nacknowledged himself his debtor for four hundred thousand florins, which\nhe had borrowed from his uncle. He threw himself at the feet of his\naugust protector, expressed the most grateful sense of his goodness, and\nbegged he might be permitted to settle in some of his imperial majesty's\ndominions. This request was immediately granted; he was allowed to\npurchase land in any part of the hereditary dominions of the house of\nAustria, to the amount of the sum I have mentioned; and made choice of\nthe country of Ratibor, in Silesia, where, in all probability, he still\nresides.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPeregrine had scarce finished the narrative, when he perceived Mr. M--\nslip something into the hand of the young man with whom he had been\nconversing at the other end of the room, and rise up from the table\nin order to take his leave. He at once understood the meaning of this\nconveyance, and longed for an opportunity to be acquainted with such\na rare instance of primitive benevolence; but the consciousness of his\npresent situation hindered him from making any advance that might be\nconstrued into forwardness or presumption.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCIX.\n\n\n\nHe is surprised with the Appearance of Hatchway and Pipes, who take up\ntheir Habitation in his Neighbourhood, contrary to his Inclination and\nexpress Desire.\n\n\nBeing now regularly initiated in the mysteries of the Fleet, and\nreconciled in some measure to the customs of the place, he began to bear\nthe edge of reflection without wincing; and thinking it would be highly\nimprudent in him to defer any longer the purposes by which only he\ncould enjoy any ease and satisfaction in his confinement, he resolved\nto resume his task of translating, and every week compose an occasional\npaper, by way of revenge upon the minister, against whom he had\ndenounced eternal war. With this view, he locked himself up in his\nchamber, and went to work with great eagerness and application, when he\nwas interrupted by a ticket porter, who, putting a letter in his hand,\nvanished in a moment, before he had time to peruse the contents.\n\nOur hero, opening the billet, was not a little surprised to find a\nbank-note for fifty pounds, enclosed in a blank sheet of paper; and,\nhaving exercised his memory and penetration on the subject of this\nunexpected windfall, had just concluded, that it could come from no\nother hand than the lady who had so kindly visited him a few days\nbefore, when his ears were suddenly invaded by the well-known sound of\nthat whistle which always hung about the neck of Pipes, as a memorial of\nhis former occupation. This tune being performed, he heard the noise\nof a wooden leg ascending the stair; upon which he opened his door, and\nbeheld his friend Hatchway, with his old shipmate at his back.\n\nAfter a cordial shake of the hand, with the usual salutation of, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\ncheer, cousin Pickle?\u00e2\u0080\u009d honest Jack seated himself without ceremony; and\ncasting his eyes around the apartment, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSplit my top-staysail,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he,\nwith an arch sneer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have got into a snug berth, cousin. Here you\nmay sit all weathers, without being turned out to take your watch, and\nno fear of the ship's dragging her anchor. You han't much room to spare,\n'tis true: an' I had known as how you stowed so close, Tom should have\nslung my own hammock for you, and then you mought have knocked down this\ngreat lubberly hurricane house. But, mayhap, you turn in double, and so\nyou don't choose to trust yourself and your doxy to a clue and canvas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPickle bore his jokes with great good-humour, rallied him in his turn\nabout the dairy-maid at the garrison; inquiring about his friends in\nthe country, asked if he had been to visit his niece, and, finally,\nexpressed a desire of knowing the cause of his journey to London. The\nlieutenant satisfied his curiosity in all these particulars; and, in\nanswer to the last question, observed that, from the information of\nPipes, understanding he was land-locked, he had come from the country in\norder to tow him into the offing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know not how the wind sets,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nhe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut if so be as three thousand pounds will bring you clear of the\ncape, say the word, and you shan't lie wind-bound another glass for want\nof the money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was an offer which few people in our hero's situation would have\naltogether refused, especially as he had all the reason in the world to\nbelieve, that, far from being a vain unmeaning compliment, it was\nthe genuine tribute of friendship, which the lieutenant would have\nwillingly, ay, and with pleasure, paid. Nevertheless, Peregrine\nperemptorily refused his assistance, though not without expressing\nhimself in terms of acknowledgment suitable to the occasion. He told\nhim, it would be time enough to make use of his generosity, when he\nshould find himself destitute of all other resource. Jack employed all\nhis rhetoric, with a view of persuading him to take this opportunity\nto procure his own enlargement; and, finding his arguments ineffectual,\ninsisted upon his accepting an immediate supply for his necessary\noccasions; swearing with great vehemence, that he would never return\nto the garrison, unless he would put him upon the footing of any other\ntenant, and receive his rent accordingly.\n\nOur young gentleman as positively swore, that he never would consider\nhim in that light; remonstrating, that he had long ago settled the\nhouse upon him for life, as a pledge of his own esteem, as well as in\nconformity with the commodore's desire; and beseeching him to return\nto his usual avocations, protested that, if ever his situation should\nsubject him to the necessity of borrowing from his friends, Mr. Hatchway\nshould be the first man to whom he would apply himself for succour.\nTo convince him that this was not the case at present, he produced the\nbank-note which he had received in the letter, together with his\nown ready money; and mentioned some other funds, which he invented\nextempore, in order to amuse the lieutenant's concern. In the close\nof this expostulation, he desired Pipes to conduct Mr. Hatchway to the\ncoffee-house, where he might amuse himself with the newspaper for half\nan hour; during which he would put on his clothes, and bespeak something\nfor dinner, that they might enjoy each other's company as long as his\noccasions would permit him to stay in that place.\n\nThe two sailors were no sooner gone, than he took up the pen, and wrote\nthe following letter, in which he enclosed the bank-note to his generous\nbenefactress:\n\n     Madam,--Your humanity is not more ingenious than my\n     suspicion. In vain you attempt to impose upon me by an\n     act of generosity, which no person on earth but your\n     ladyship is capable of committing. Though your name was\n     not subscribed on the paper, your sentiments were fully\n     displayed in the contents, which I must beg leave to\n     restore, with the same sense of gratitude, and for the\n     same reasons I expressed when last I had the honour to\n     converse with you upon this subject. Though I am deprived\n     of my liberty by the villainy and ingratitude of mankind,\n     I am not yet destitute of the other conveniences of life;\n     and therefore beg to be excused for incurring an unnecessary\n     addition to that load of obligation you have already laid\n     upon, madam, your ladyship's most devoted, humble servant,\n                                     \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeregrine Pickle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaving dressed himself, and repaired to the place of appointment, he\ndespatched this epistle by the hands of Pipes, who was ordered to leave\nit at her ladyship's house, without staying for an answer; and in the\nmeantime gave directions for dinner, which he and his friend Hatchway\nate very cheerfully in his own apartment, after he had entertained him\nwith a sight of all the curiosities in the place. During their repast,\nJack repeated his kind offers to our adventurer, who declined them with\nhis former obstinacy, and begged he might be no more importuned on\nthat subject; but if he insisted upon giving some fresh proofs of his\nfriendship, he might have an opportunity of exhibiting it in taking\nPipes under his care and protection; for nothing affected him so much as\nhis inability to provide for such a faithful adherent.\n\nThe lieutenant desired he would give himself no trouble upon that score;\nhe being, of his own accord, perfectly well disposed to befriend his old\nshipmate, who should never want while he had a shilling to spare. But\nhe began to drop some hints of an intention to fix his quarters in the\nFleet, observing, that the air seemed to be very good in that place, and\nthat he was tired of living in the country. What he said did not amount\nto a plain declaration, and therefore Peregrine did not answer it\nas such, though he perceived his drift; and took an opportunity of\ndescribing the inconveniences of the place, in such a manner as,\nhe hoped, would deter him from putting such an extravagant plan in\nexecution.\n\nThis expedient, however, far from answering the end proposed, had a\nquite contrary effect, and furnished Hatchway with an argument against\nhis own unwillingness to quit such a disagreeable place. In all\nprobability, Jack would have been more explicit with regard to the\nscheme he had proposed, if the conversation had not been interrupted by\nthe arrival of Cadwallader, who never failed in the performance of his\ndiurnal visit. Hatchway, conjecturing that this stranger might have some\nprivate business with his friend, quitted the apartment, on pretence of\ntaking a turn; and meeting Pipes at the door, desired his company to\nthe Bare, by which name the open space is distinguished; where, during\na course of perambulation, these two companions held a council upon\nPickle, in consequence of which it was determined, since he obstinately\npersisted to refuse their assistance, that they should take lodgings\nin his neighbourhood, with a view of being at hand to minister unto his\noccasions, in spite of his false delicacy, according to the emergency of\nhis affairs.\n\nThis resolution being taken, they consulted the bar-keeper of the\ncoffee-house about lodging, and she directed them to the warden; to whom\nthe lieutenant, in his great wisdom, represented himself as a kinsman to\nPeregrine, who, rather than leave that young gentleman by himself to the\nunavoidable discomforts of a prison, was inclined to keep him company,\ntill such time as his affairs could be put in order. This measure he\nthe more anxiously desired to take, because the prisoner was sometimes\nsubject to a disordered imagination, upon which occasion he stood in\nneed of extraordinary attendance; and therefore he, the lieutenant,\nentreated the warden to accommodate him with a lodging for himself\nand his servant, for which he was ready to make any reasonable\nacknowledgment. The warden, who was a sensible and humane man, could\nnot help applauding his resolution; and several rooms being at that time\nunoccupied, he put him immediately in possession of a couple, which were\nforthwith prepared for his reception.\n\nThis affair being settled to his satisfaction, he despatched Pipes for\nhis portmanteau; and, returning to the coffee-house, found Peregrine,\nwith whom he spent the remaining part of the evening. Our hero, taking\nit for granted that he proposed to set out for the garrison next day,\nwrote a memorandum of some books which he had left in that habitation,\nand which he now desired Jack to send up to town by the waggon, directed\nfor Mr. Crabtree. He cautioned him against giving the least hint of\nhis misfortune in the neighbourhood, that it might remain, as long as\npossible, concealed from the knowledge of his sister, who, he knew,\nwould afflict herself immoderately at the news, nor reach the ears of\nthe rest of his family, who would exult and triumph over his distress.\n\nHatchway listened to his injunctions with great attention, and promised\nto demean himself accordingly. Then the discourse shifted to an\nagreeable recapitulation of the merry scenes they had formerly acted\ntogether. And the evening being pretty far advanced, Peregrine, with\nseeming reluctance, told him that the gates of the Fleet would in a few\nminutes be shut for the night, and that there was an absolute necessity\nfor his withdrawing to his lodging. Jack replied, that he could not\nthink of parting with him so soon, after such a long separation; and\nthat he was determined to stay with him an hour or two longer, if he\nshould be obliged to take up his lodging in the streets. Pickle, rather\nthan disoblige his guest, indulged him in his desire and resolved to\ngive him a share of his own bed. A pair of chickens and asparagus were\nbespoke for supper, at which Pipes attended with an air of internal\nsatisfaction; and the bottle was bandied about in a jovial manner till\nmidnight, when the lieutenant rose up to take his leave, observing,\nthat, being fatigued with riding, he was inclined to turn in. Pipes,\nupon this intimation, produced a lanthorn ready lighted; and Jack,\nshaking his entertainer by the hand, wished him good night, and promised\nto visit him again betimes in the morning.\n\nPeregrine, imagining that his behaviour proceeded from the wine, which\nhe had plentifully drunk, told him, that, if he was disposed to sleep,\nhis bed was ready prepared in the room, and ordered his attendant to\nundress his master; upon which Mr. Hatchway gave him to understand, that\nhe had no occasion to incommode his friend, having already provided a\nlodging for himself, and the young gentleman demanding an explanation,\nhe frankly owned what he had done, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou gave me such a dismal\naccount of the place, that I could not think of leaving you in it\nwithout company.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Our young gentleman, who was naturally impatient\nof benefits, and foresaw that this uncommon instance of Hatchway's\nfriendship would encroach upon the plan which he had formed for his own\nsubsistence, by engrossing his time and attention, so as that he should\nnot be able to prosecute his labours, closeted the lieutenant next day,\nand demonstrated to him the folly and ill consequences of the step he\nhad taken. He observed, that the world in general would look upon it as\nthe effect of mere madness; and, if his relations were so disposed, they\nmight make it the foundation for a statute of lunacy against him; that\nhis absence from the garrison must be a very great detriment to his\nprivate affairs; and, lastly, that his presence in the Fleet would be\na very great hindrance to Pickle himself, whose hope of regaining his\nliberty altogether depended upon his being detached from all company and\ninterruption.\n\nTo these remonstrances Jack replied, that, as to the opinion of\nthe world, it was no more to him than a rotten net-line; and if his\nrelations had a mind to have his upper works condemned, he did not doubt\nbut he should be able to stand the survey, without being declared unfit\nfor service; that he had no affairs at the garrison, but such as\nwould keep cold; and with regard to Pickle's being interrupted by his\npresence, he gave him his word, that he would never come alongside of\nhim, except when he should give him the signal for holding discourse.\nIn conclusion, he signified his resolution to stay where he was, at all\nevents, without making himself accountable to any person, whatsoever.\n\nPeregrine seeing him determined, desisted from any further importunity;\nresolving, however, to tire him out of his plan by reserve and\nsupercilious neglect; for he could not bear the thought of being so\nnotoriously obliged by any person upon earth. With this view he quitted\nthe lieutenant, upon some slight pretence; after having told him, that\nhe could not have the pleasure of his company at dinner, because he was\nengaged with a particular club of his fellow-prisoners.\n\nJack was a stranger to the punctilios of behaviour, and therefore did\nnot take this declaration amiss; but had immediate recourse to the\nadvice of his counsellor, Mr. Pipes, who proposed, that he should go to\nthe coffee-house and kitchen, and give the people to understand that he\nwould pay for all such liquor and provisions as Mr. Pickle should order\nto be sent to his lodging. This expedient was immediately practised; and\nas there was no credit in the place, Hatchway deposited a sum of money,\nby way of security, to the cook and the vintner, intimating, that\nthere was a necessity for taking that method of befriending his cousin\nPeregrine, who was subject to strange whims, that rendered it impossible\nto serve him any other way.\n\nIn consequence of these insinuations, it was that same day rumoured\nabout the Fleet, that Mr. Pickle was an unhappy gentleman disordered in\nhis understanding, and that the lieutenant was his near relation, who\nhad subjected himself to the inconvenience of living in a jail, with\nthe sole view of keeping a strict eye over his conduct. This report,\nhowever, did not reach the ears of our hero till the next day, when he\nsent one of the runners of the Fleet, who attended him, to bespeak and\npay for a couple of pullets, and something else for dinner, to which\nhe had already invited his friend Hatchway, in hope of being able to\npersuade him to retire into the country, after he had undergone a\nwhole day's mortification in the place. The messenger returned with\nan assurance, that the dinner should be made ready according to his\ndirections, and restored the money, observing, that his kinsman had paid\nfor what was bespoke.\n\nPeregrine was equally surprised and disgusted at this information, and\nresolved to chide the lieutenant severely for his unseasonable treat,\nwhich he considered as a thing repugnant to his reputation. Meanwhile,\nhe despatched his attendant for wine to the coffee-house, and finding\nhis credit bolstered up in that place by the same means, was enraged at\nthe presumption of Jack's friendship. He questioned the valet about\nit with such manifestation of displeasure, that the fellow, afraid of\ndisobliging such a good master, frankly communicated the story which was\ncirculated at his expense. The young gentleman was so much incensed at\nthis piece of intelligence, that he wrote a bitter expostulation to the\nlieutenant, where he not only retracted his invitation, but declared\nthat he would never converse with him while he should remain within the\nplace.\n\nHaving thus obeyed the dictates of his anger, he gave notice to the\ncook, that he should not have occasion for what was ordered. Repairing\nto the coffee-house, he told the landlord, that whereas he understood\nthe stranger with the wooden leg had prepossessed him and others with\nridiculous notions, tending to bring the sanity of his intellects in\nquestion, and, to confirm this imputation, had, under the pretence of\nconsanguinity, undertaken to defray his expenses; he could not help, in\njustice to himself, declaring, that the same person was, in reality,\nthe madman, who had given his keepers the slip; that, therefore, he, the\nlandlord, would not find his account in complying with his orders, and\nencouraging him to frequent his house; and that, for his own part, he\nwould never enter the door, or favour him with the least trifle of his\ncustom, if ever he should for the future find himself anticipated in his\npayments by that unhappy lunatic.\n\nThe vintner was confounded at this retorted charge; and, after\nmuch perplexity and deliberation, concluded, that both parties were\ndistracted; the stranger in paying a man's debts against his will, and\nPickle, in being offended at such forwardness of friendship.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER C.\n\n\n\nThese Associates commit an Assault upon Crabtree, for which they\nare banished from the Fleet--Peregrine begins to feel the effects of\nConfinement.\n\n\nOur adventurer having dined at an ordinary, and in the afternoon retired\nto his own apartment, as usual, with his friend Cadwallader, Hatchway\nand his associate, after they had been obliged to discuss the provision\nfor which they had paid, renewed their conference upon the old subject.\nPipes giving his messmate to understand, that Peregrine's chief\nconfidant was the old deaf bachelor, whom he had seen at his lodging the\npreceding day, Mr. Hatchway, in his great penetration, discovered,\nthat the young gentleman's obstinacy proceeded from the advice of the\nmisanthrope, whom, for that reason, it was their business to chastise.\nPipes entered into this opinion the more willingly, as he had all along\nbelieved the senior to be a sort of wizard, or some cacodaemon, whom\nit was not very creditable to be acquainted with. Indeed, he had been\ninspired with this notion by the insinuations of Hadgi, who had formerly\ndropped some hints touching Crabtree's profound knowledge in the magic\nart; mentioning, in particular, his being possessed of the philosopher's\nstone; an assertion to which Tom had given implicit credit, until his\nmaster was sent to prison for debt, when he could no longer suppose\nCadwallader lord of such a valuable secret, or else he would have\ncertainly procured the enlargement of his most intimate friend.\n\nWith these sentiments, he espoused the resentment of Hatchway. They\ndetermined to seize the supposed conjurer, with the first opportunity,\non his return from his visit to Peregrine, and, without hesitation,\nexercise upon him the discipline of the pump. This plan they would have\nexecuted that same evening, had not the misanthrope luckily withdrawn\nhimself, by accident, before it was dark, and even before they had\nintelligence of his retreat. But, next day, they kept themselves upon\nthe watch till he appeared, and Pipes lifting his hat, as Crabtree\npassed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cO d-- ye, old Dunny,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou and I must grapple by and\nby; and a'gad I shall lie so near your quarter, that your ear-ports will\nlet in the sound, thof they are double caulked with oakum.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe misanthrope's ears were not quite so fast closed, but that they\nreceived this intimation; which, though delivered in terms that he did\nnot well understand, had such an effect upon his apprehension, that he\nsignified his doubts to Peregrine, observing, that he did not much like\nthe looks of that same ruffian with the wooden leg. Pickle assured him,\nhe had nothing to fear from the two sailors, who could have no cause of\nresentment against him; or, if they had, would not venture to take\nany step, which they knew must block up all the avenues to that\nreconcilement, about which they were so anxious; and, moreover, give\nsuch offence to the governor of the place as would infallibly induce him\nto expel them both from his territories.\n\nNotwithstanding this assurance, the young gentleman was not so confident\nof the lieutenant's discretion, as to believe that Crabtree's fears were\naltogether without foundation; he forthwith conjectured that Jack had\ntaken umbrage at an intimacy from which he found himself excluded, and\nimputed his disgrace to the insinuations of Cadwallader, whom, in all\nlikelihood, he intended to punish for his supposed advice. He knew his\nfriend could sustain no great damage from the lieutenant's resentment,\nin a place which he could immediately alarm with his cries, and\ntherefore wished he might fall into the snare, because it would furnish\nhim with a pretence of complaint; in consequence of which, the sailors\nwould be obliged to shift their quarters, so as that he should be rid of\ntheir company, in which he at present could find no enjoyment.\n\nEverything happened as he had foreseen; the misanthrope, in his retreat\nfrom Peregrine's chamber, was assaulted by Hatchway and his associate,\nwho seized him by the collar without ceremony, and began to drag him\ntowards the pump, at which they would have certainly complimented him\nwith a very disagreeable bath, had not he exalted his voice in such a\nmanner, as in a moment brought a number of the inhabitants, and Pickle\nhimself, to his aid. The assailants would have persisted in their\ndesign, had the opposition been such as they could have faced with any\npossibility of success; nor did they quit their prey, before a dozen, at\nleast, had come to his rescue, and Peregrine with a menacing aspect and\nair of authority, commanded his old valet to withdraw. Then they thought\nproper to sheer off, and betake themselves to close quarters, while our\nhero accompanied the affrighted Cadwallader to the gate, and exhibited\nto the warden a formal complaint against the rioters, upon whom he\nretorted the charge of lunacy, which was supported by the evidence of\ntwenty persons, who had been eye-witnesses of the outrage committed\nagainst the old gentleman. The governor, in consequence of this\ninformation, sent a message to Mr. Hatchway, warning him to move\nhis lodging next day, on pain of being expelled. The lieutenant\ncontumaciously refusing to comply with this intimation, was in the\nmorning, while he amused himself in walking upon the Bare, suddenly\nsurrounded by the constables of the court, who took him and his adherent\nprisoners, before they were aware, and delivered them into the hands of\nthe turnkeys, by whom they were immediately dismissed, and their baggage\nconveyed to the side of the ditch.\n\nThis expulsion was not performed without an obstinate opposition on the\npart of the delinquents, who, had they not been surprised, would have\nset the whole Fleet at defiance, and, in all probability, have acted\ndivers tragedies, before they could have been overpowered. Things\nbeing circumstanced as they were, the lieutenant did not part with his\nconductor without tweaking his nose, by way of farewell; and Pipes,\nin imitation of such a laudable example, communicated a token of\nremembrance, in an application to the sole eye of his attendant, who,\nscorning to be outdone in this kind of courtesy, returned the compliment\nwith such good-will, that Tom's organ performed the office of a\nmultiplying-glass. These were mutual hints for stripping, and,\naccordingly, each was naked from the waist upwards in a trice. A ring\nof butchers from the market was immediately formed; a couple of the\nreverend flamens, who, in morning gowns, ply for marriages in that\nquarter of the town, constituted themselves seconds and umpires of the\napproaching contest, and the battle began without further preparation.\nThe combatants were, in point of strength and agility, pretty equally\nmatched; but the jailor had been regularly trained in the art of\nbruising: he had more than once signalized himself in public, by his\nprowess and skill in this exercise, and lost one eye upon the stage in\nthe course of his exploits. This was a misfortune of which Pipes did not\nfail to take the advantage. He had already sustained several hard knocks\nupon his temples and jaws, and found it impracticable to smite his\nantagonist upon the victualling-office, so dexterously was it defended\nagainst assault. He then changed his battery, and being ambidexter,\nraised such a clatter upon the turnkey's blind side, that this hero,\nbelieving him left-handed, converted his attention that way, and opposed\nthe unenlightened side of his face to the right hand of Pipes, which\nbeing thus unprovided against, slyly bestowed upon him a peg under the\nfifth rib, that in an instant laid him senseless on the pavement, at\nthe feet of his conqueror. Pipes was congratulated upon his victory,\nnot only by his friend Hatchway, but also by all the by-standers,\nparticularly the priest who had espoused his cause, and now invited the\nstrangers to his lodgings in a neighbouring alehouse, where they were\nentertained so much to their liking, that they determined to seek\nno other habitation while they should continue in town; and,\nnotwithstanding the disgrace and discouragement they had met with, in\ntheir endeavours to serve our adventurer, they were still resolved to\npersevere in their good offices, or, in the vulgar phrase, to see him\nout.\n\nWhile they settled themselves in this manner, and acquired familiar\nconnections round all the purlieus of the ditch, Peregrine found himself\ndeprived of the company of Cadwallader, who signified, by letter, that\nhe did not choose to hazard his person again in visiting him, while such\nassassins occupied the avenues through which he must pass; for he had\nbeen at pains to inquire into the motions of the seamen, and informed\nhimself exactly of the harbour in which they were moored.\n\nOur hero had been so much accustomed to the conversation of Crabtree,\nwhich was altogether suitable to the singularity of his own disposition,\nthat he could very ill afford to be debarred of it at this juncture,\nwhen almost every other source of enjoyment was stopped. He was,\nhowever, obliged to submit to the hardships of his situation; and as the\ncharacters of his fellow-prisoners did not at all improve upon him, he\nwas compelled to seek for satisfaction within himself. Not but that he\nhad an opportunity of conversing with some people who neither wanted\nsense, nor were deficient in point of principle; yet there appeared in\nthe behaviour of them all, without exception, a certain want of decorum,\na squalor of sentiment, a sort of jailish cast contracted in the course\nof confinement, which disgusted the delicacy of our hero's observation.\nHe, therefore, detached himself from their parties as much as he could,\nwithout giving offence to those among whom he was obliged to live, and\nresumed his labours with incredible eagerness and perseverance, his\nspirits being supported by the success of some severe philippics, which\nhe occasionally published against the author of his misfortune.\n\nNor was his humanity unemployed in the vacations of his revenge. A man\nmust be void of all sympathy and compassion, who can reside among so\nmany miserable objects, without feeling an inclination to relieve their\ndistress. Every day almost presented to his view such lamentable scenes\nas were most likely to attract his notice, and engage his benevolence.\nReverses of fortune, attended with the most deplorable circumstances of\ndomestic woe, were continually intruding upon his acquaintance; his ears\nwere invaded with the cries of the hapless wife, who, from the enjoyment\nof affluence and pleasure, was forced to follow her husband to this\nabode of wretchedness and want; his eyes were every minute assailed\nwith the naked and meagre appearances of hunger and cold; and his fancy\nteemed with a thousand aggravations of their misery.\n\nThus situated, his purse was never shut while his heart remained open.\nWithout reflecting upon the slenderness of his store, he exercised his\ncharity to all the children of distress, and acquired a popularity,\nwhich, though pleasing, was far from being profitable. In short, his\nbounty kept no pace with his circumstances, and in a little time he was\nutterly exhausted. He had recourse to his bookseller, from whom, with\ngreat difficulty, he obtained a small reinforcement; and immediately\nrelapsed into the same want of retention. He was conscious of his\ninfirmity, and found it incurable: he foresaw that by his own industry\nhe should never be able to defray the expense of these occasions; and\nthis reflection sunk deep into his mind. The approbation of the public,\nwhich he had earned or might acquire like a cordial often repeated,\nbegan to lose its effect upon his imagination; his health suffered by\nhis sedentary life and austere application, his eyesight failed, his\nappetite forsook him, his spirits decayed; so that he became melancholy,\nlistless, and altogether incapable of prosecuting the only means he had\nleft for his subsistence; and, what did not at all contribute to the\nalleviation of these particulars, he was given to understand by his\nlawyer, that he had lost his cause, and was condemned in costs. Even\nthis was not the most mortifying piece of intelligence he received:\nhe at the same time learned that his bookseller was bankrupt, and his\nfriend Crabtree at the point of death.\n\nThese were comfortable considerations to a youth of Peregrine's\ndisposition, which was so capricious, that the more his misery\nincreased, the more haughty and inflexible he became. Rather than be\nbeholden to Hatchway, who still hovered about the gate, eager for an\nopportunity to assist him, he chose to undergo the want of almost every\nconvenience of life, and actually pledged his wearing apparel to an\nIrish pawnbroker in the Fleet, for money to purchase those things,\nwithout which he must have absolutely perished. He was gradually\nirritated by his misfortunes into a rancorous resentment against mankind\nin general, and his heart so alienated from the enjoyments of life, that\nhe did not care how soon he quitted his miserable existence. Though he\nhad shocking examples of the vicissitudes of fortune continually before\nhis eyes, he could never be reconciled to the idea of living like his\nfellow-sufferers, in the most abject degree of dependence. If he refused\nto accept of favours from his own allies and intimate friends, whom he\nhad formerly obliged, it is not to be supposed that he would listen to\nproposals of that kind from any of his fellow-prisoners, with whom he\nhad contracted acquaintance: he was even more cautious than ever of\nincurring obligations; he now shunned his former messmates, in order to\navoid disagreeable tenders of friendship. Imagining that he perceived\nan inclination in the clergyman to learn the state of his finances, he\ndiscouraged and declined the explanation, and at length secluded himself\nfrom all society.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER CI.\n\n\n\nHe receives an unexpected Visit; and the Clouds of Misfortune begin to\nseparate.\n\n\nWhile he pined in this forlorn condition, with an equal abhorrence of\nthe world and himself, Captain Gauntlet arrived in town in order to\nemploy his interest for promotion in the army; and in consequence of his\nwife's particular desire, made it his business to inquire for Peregrine,\nto whom he longed to be reconciled, even though at the expense of a\nslight submission. But he could hear no tidings of him, at the place to\nwhich he was directed; and, on the supposition that our hero had gone\nto reside in the country, applied himself to his own business,\nwith intention to renew his inquiries, after that affair should be\ntransacted. He communicated his demands to his supposed patron, who had\nassumed the merit of making him a captain, and been gratified with a\nvaluable present on that consideration; and was cajoled with hopes of\nsucceeding in his present aim by the same interest.\n\nMeanwhile, he became acquainted with one of the clerks belonging to\nthe War Office, whose advice and assistance, he was told, would be a\nfurtherance to his scheme. As he had occasion to discourse with this\ngentleman upon the circumstances of his expectation, he learned that the\nnobleman, upon whom he depended, was a person of no consequence in the\nstate, and altogether incapable of assisting him in his advancement.\nAt the same time, his counsellor expressed his surprise that Captain\nGauntlet did not rather interest in his cause the noble peer to whose\ngood offices he owed his last commission.\n\nThis remark introduced an explanation, by which Godfrey discovered, to\nhis infinite astonishment, the mistake in which he had continued so long\nwith regard to his patron; though he could not divine the motive which\ninduced a nobleman, with whom he had no acquaintance or connection,\nto interpose his influence in his behalf. Whatsoever that might be, he\nthought it was his duty to make his acknowledgment; and for that purpose\nwent next morning to his house, where he was politely received, and\ngiven to understand that Mr. Pickle was the person to whose friendship\nhe was indebted for his last promotion.\n\nInexpressible were the transports of gratitude, affection, and remorse\nthat took possession of the soul of Gauntlet, when this mystery was\nunfolded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood Heaven!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he, lifting up his hands, \u00e2\u0080\u009chave I lived\nso long in a state of animosity with my benefactor? I intended to have\nreconciled myself at any rate before I was sensible of this obligation,\nbut now I shall not enjoy a moment's quiet until I have an opportunity\nof expressing to him my sense of his heroic friendship. I presume,\nfrom the nature of the favour conferred upon him in my behalf, that\nMr. Pickle is well known to your lordship; and I should think myself\nextremely happy if you could inform me in what part of the country he is\nto be found; for the person with whom he lodged some time ago could give\nme no intelligence of his motions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe nobleman, touched with this instance of generous self-denial in\nPeregrine, as well as with the sensibility of his friend, lamented the\nunhappiness of our hero, while he gave Gauntlet to understand that he\nhad been long disordered in his intellects, in consequence of having\nsquandered away his fortune; and that his creditors had thrown him into\nthe Fleet prison; but whether he still continued in that confinement, or\nwas released from his misfortunes by death, his lordship did not know,\nbecause he had never inquired.\n\nGodfrey no sooner received this intimation, than, his blood boiling with\ngrief and impatience, he craved pardon for his abrupt departure; then\nquitting his informer on the instant, re-embarked in his hackney-coach,\nand ordered himself to be conveyed directly to the Fleet. As the vehicle\nproceeded along one side of the market, he was surprised with the\nappearance of Hatchway and Pipes, who stood cheapening cauliflowers at a\ngreen-stall, their heads being cased in worsted nightcaps, half covered\nwith their hats, and a short tobacco-pipe in the mouth of each. He was\nrejoiced at sight of the two seamen, which he took for a happy omen of\nfinding his friend, and, ordering the coachman to stop the carriage,\ncalled to the lieutenant by his name. Jack replying with an hilloah,\nlooking behind him, and recognizing the face of his old acquaintance,\nran up to the coach with great eagerness. Shaking the captain heartily\nby the hand, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOdds heart!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am glad thou hast fallen in with\nus; we shall now be able to find the trim of the vessel, and lay her\nabout on t'other tack. For my own part, I have had many a consort in my\ntime, that is, in the way of good fellowship, and I always made a\nshift to ware 'em at one time or another. But this headstrong toad will\nneither obey the helm nor the sheet; and for aught I know, will founder\nwhere a lies at anchor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGauntlet, who conceived part of his meaning, alighted immediately; and\nbeing conducted to the sailor's lodging, was informed of everything\nthat had passed between the lieutenant and Pickle. He, in his turn,\ncommunicated to Jack the discovery which he had made, with regard to his\ncommission; at which the other gave no signs of surprise, but, taking\nthe pipe from his mouth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy look ye, captain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat's not\nthe only good turn you have owed him. That same money you received from\nthe commodore as an old debt was all a sham, contrived by Pickle for\nyour service; but a wool drive under his bare poles without sails and\nrigging, or a mess of provision on board, rather than take the same\nassistance from another man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGodfrey was not only amazed, but chagrined at the knowledge of this\nanecdote; which gave umbrage to his pride, while it stimulated his\ndesire of doing something in return for the obligation. He inquired into\nthe present circumstances of the prisoner; and understanding that he was\nindisposed, and but indifferently provided with the common necessaries\nof life, though still deaf to all offers of assistance, began to be\nextremely concerned at the account of this savage obstinacy and pride,\nwhich would, he feared, exclude him from the privilege of relieving him\nin his distress. However, he resolved to leave no expedient untried,\nthat might have any tendency to surmount such destructive prejudice;\nand entering the jail, was directed to the apartment of the wretched\nprisoner. He knocked softly at the door, and, when it was opened,\nstarted back with horror and astonishment. The figure that presented\nitself to his view was the remains of his once happy friend; but\nso miserably altered and disguised, that his features were scarce\ncognisable. The florid, the sprightly, the gay, the elevated youth, was\nnow metamorphosed into a wan, dejected, meagre, squalid spectre; the\nhollow-eyed representative of distemper, indigence, and despair. Yet his\neyes retained a certain ferocity, which threw a dismal gleam athwart the\ncloudiness of his aspect, and he, in silence, viewed his old companion\nwith a look betokening confusion and disdain. As for Gauntlet, he could\nnot, without emotion, behold such a woeful reverse of fate, in a person\nfor whom he entertained the noblest sentiments of friendship, gratitude,\nand esteem; his sorrow was at first too big for utterance, and he shed a\nflood of tears before he could pronounce one word.\n\nPeregrine, in spite of his misanthropy, could not help being affected\nwith this uncommon testimony of regard; but he strove to stifle his\nsensations. His brows contracted themselves into a severe frown; his\neyes kindled into the appearance of live coals. He waved with his hand\nin signal for Godfrey to be gone, and leave such a wretch as him to the\nmiseries of his fate; and, finding nature too strong to be suppressed,\nuttered a deep groan, and wept aloud.\n\nThe soldier, seeing him thus melted, unable to restrain the strong\nimpulse of his affection, sprung towards, and clasping him in his arms,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dearest friend, and best benefactor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am come hither to\nhumble myself for the offence I was so unhappy as to give at our\nlast parting; to beg a reconciliation, to thank you for the case and\naffluence I have enjoyed through your means, and to rescue you, in spite\nof yourself, from this melancholy situation; of which, but an hour ago,\nI was utterly ignorant. Do not deny me the satisfaction of acquitting\nmyself in point of duty and obligation. You must certainly have had some\nregard for a person in whose favour you have exerted yourself so much;\nand if any part of that esteem remains, you will not refuse him an\nopportunity of approving himself in some measure worthy of it. Let\nme not suffer the most mortifying of all repulses, that of slighted\nfriendship; but kindly sacrifice your resentment and inflexibility to\nthe request of one who is at all times ready to sacrifice his life for\nyour honour and advantage. If you will not yield to my entreaties, have\nsome regard to the wishes of my Sophy, who laid me under the strongest\ninjunctions to solicit your forgiveness, even before she knew how much I\nwas indebted to your generosity; or, if that consideration should be of\nno weight, I hope you will relax a little for the sake of poor Emilia,\nwhose resentment hath been long subdued by her affection, and who now\ndroops in secret at your neglect.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEvery word of this address, delivered in the most pathetic manner,\nmade an impression upon the mind of Peregrine. He was affected with the\nsubmission of his friend, who, in reality, had given him no just\ncause to complain. He knew that no ordinary motive had swayed him to a\ncondescension so extraordinary in a man of his punctilious temper. He\nconsidered it, therefore, as the genuine effect of eager gratitude and\ndisinterested love, and his heart began to relent accordingly. When he\nheard himself conjured in the name of the gentle Sophy, his obstinacy\nwas quite overcome; and when Emilia was recalled to his remembrance,\nhis whole frame underwent a violent agitation. He took his friend by the\nhand, with a softened look; and, as soon as he recovered the faculty\nof speech, which had been overpowered in the conflict of passions that\ntransported him, protested, that he retained no vestige of animosity,\nbut considered him in the light of an affectionate comrade, the ties of\nwhose friendship adversity could not unbind. He mentioned Sophy in the\nmost respectful terms; spoke of Emilia with the most reverential awe,\nas the object of his inviolable love and veneration; but disclaimed\nall hope of ever more attracting her regard, and excused himself from\nprofiting by Godfrey's kind intention; declaring, with a resolute\nair, that he had broken off all connection with mankind, and that he\nimpatiently longed for the hour of his dissolution, which, if it should\nnot soon arrive by the course of nature, he was resolved to hasten\nwith his own hands, rather than be exposed to the contempt, and more\nintolerable pity, of a rascally world.\n\nGauntlet argued against this frantic determination with all the\nvehemence of expostulating friendship; but his remonstrances did not\nproduce the desired effect upon our desperate hero, who calmly refuted\nall his arguments, and asserted the rectitude of his design from the\npretended maxims of reason and true philosophy. While this dispute was\ncarried on with eagerness on one side, and deliberation on the other, a\nletter was brought to Peregrine, who threw it carelessly aside unopened,\nthough the superscription was in a handwriting to which he was a\nstranger; and, in all probability, the contents would never have been\nperused, had not Gauntlet insisted upon his waiving all ceremony, and\nreading it forthwith. Thus solicited, Pickle unsealed the billet, which,\nto his no small surprise, contained the following intimation:--\n\n     Sir,--This comes to inform you, that, after many dangers\n     and disappointments, I am, by the blessing of God, safely\n     arrived in the Downs, on board of the Gomberoon Indiaman,\n     having made a tolerable voyage; by which I hope I shall be\n     enabled to repay, with interest, the seven hundred pounds\n     which I borrowed of you before my departure from England.\n     I take this opportunity of writing by our purser, who goes\n     express with despatches for the Company, that you may have\n     this satisfactory notice as soon as possible, relating to\n     one whom I suppose you have long given over as lost. I have\n     enclosed it in a letter to my broker, who, I hope, knows\n     your address, and will forward it accordingly. And I am,\n     with respect, Sir, your most humble servant,\n                                         \u00e2\u0080\u009cBenjamin Chintz.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe had no sooner taken a cursory view of this agreeable epistle, than\nhis countenance cleared up, and, reaching it to his friend, with a\nsmile, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis a more convincing argument, on your side\nof the question, than all the casuists in the universe can advance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Gauntlet, wondering at this observation, took the paper, and, casting\nhis eyes greedily upon the contents, congratulated him upon the receipt\nof it, with extravagant demonstrations of joy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot on account of the\nsum,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich, upon my honour, I would with pleasure pay three\ntimes over for your convenience and satisfaction; but because it seems\nto have reconciled you to life, and disposed your mind for enjoying the\ncomforts of society.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe instantaneous effect which this unexpected smile of fortune produced\nin the appearance of our adventurer is altogether inconceivable; it\nplumped up his cheeks in a moment, unbended and enlightened every\nfeature of his face; elevated his head, which had begun to sink as\nit were, between his shoulders; and from a squeaking dispirited tone,\nswelled up his voice to a clear manly accent. Godfrey, taking advantage\nof this favourable change, began to regale him with prospects of future\nsuccess. He reminded him of his youth and qualifications, which were\ncertainly designed for better days than those he had as yet seen;\nhe pointed out various paths by which he might arrive at wealth and\nreputation; he importuned him to accept of a sum for his immediate\noccasions; and earnestly begged that he would allow him to discharge\nthe debt for which he was confined, observing, that Sophy's fortune\nhad enabled him to exhibit that proof of his gratitude, without any\ndetriment to his affairs; and protesting that he should not believe\nhimself in possession of Mr. Pickle's esteem, unless he was permitted to\nmake some such return of good-will to the man, who had not only raised\nhim from indigence and scorn, to competence and reputable rank, but also\nempowered him to obtain the possession of an excellent woman, who had\nfilled up the measure of his felicity.\n\nPeregrine declared himself already overpaid for all his good offices,\nby the pleasure he enjoyed in employing them, and the happy effects they\nhad produced in the mutual satisfaction of two persons so dear to his\naffection; and assured his friend, that one time or other he would set\nhis conscience at ease, and remove the scruples of his honour, by having\nrecourse to his assistance; but at present he could not make use of his\nfriendship, without giving just cause of offence to honest Hatchway,\nwho was prior to him in point of solicitation, and had manifested his\nattachment with surprising obstinacy and perseverance.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER CII.\n\n\n\nPeregrine reconciles himself to the Lieutenant, and renews his\nConnection with Society--Divers Plans are projected in his behalf, and\nhe has occasion to exhibit a remarkable Proof of Self-denial.\n\n\nThe captain, with reluctance, yielded the preference in this particular\nto Jack, who was immediately invited to a conference, by a note\nsubscribed with Pickle's own hand. He was found at the prison-gate\nwaiting for Gauntlet, to know the issue of his negotiation. He no sooner\nreceived this summons, than he set all his sails, and made the best of\nhis way to his friend's apartment; being admitted by the turnkey, in\nconsequence of Peregrine's request, communicated by the messenger who,\ncarried the billet. Pipes followed close in the wake of his shipmate;\nand, in a few minutes after the note had been despatched, Peregrine and\nGauntlet heard the sound of the stump, ascending the wooden staircase\nwith such velocity, that they at first mistook it for the application of\ndrumsticks to the head of an empty barrel. This uncommon speed, however,\nwas attended with a misfortune; he chanced to overlook a small defect in\none of the steps, and his prop plunging into a hole, he fell backwards,\nto the imminent danger of his life. Tom was luckily at his back, and\nsustained him in his arms, so as that he escaped without any other\ndamage than the loss of his wooden leg, which was snapped in the middle,\nby the weight of his body in falling; and such was his impatience, that\nhe would not give himself the trouble to disengage the fractured member.\nUnbuckling the whole equipage in a trice, he left it sticking in the\ncrevice, saying, a rotten cable was not worth heaving up, and, in\nthis natural state of mutilation, hopped into the room with infinite\nexpedition.\n\nPeregrine, taking him cordially by the hand, seated him upon one side of\nhis bed; and, after having made an apology for that reserve of which he\nhad so justly complained, asked if he could conveniently accommodate\nhim with the loan of twenty guineas. The lieutenant, without opening\nhis mouth, pulled out his purse; and Pipes, who overheard the demand,\napplying the whistle to his lips, performed a loud overture, in token of\nhis joy. Matters being thus brought to an accommodation, our hero told\nthe captain, that he should be glad of his company at dinner, with their\ncommon friend Hatchway, if he would in the meantime leave him to the\nministry of Pipes; and the soldier went away for the present, in order\nto pay a short visit to his uncle, who at that time languished in a\ndeclining state of health, promising to return at the appointed hour.\n\nThe lieutenant, having surveyed the dismal appearance of his friend,\ncould not help being moved at the spectacle, and began to upbraid\nhim with his obstinate pride, which, he swore, was no better than\nself-murder. But the young gentleman interrupted him in the course of\nhis moralizing, by telling him he had reasons for his conduct, which,\nperhaps, he would impart in due season; but, at present, his design was\nto alter that plan of behaviour, and make himself some amends for the\nmisery he had undergone. He accordingly sent Pipes to redeem his clothes\nfrom the pawnbroker's wardrobe, and bespeak something comfortable for\ndinner. When Godfrey came back, he was very agreeably surprised to see\nsuch a favourable alteration in his externals; for, by the assistance of\nhis valet, he had purified himself from the dregs of his distress, and\nnow appeared in a decent suit, with clean linen, while his face was\ndisencumbered of the hair that overshadowed it, and his apartment\nprepared for the reception of company.\n\nThey enjoyed their meal with great satisfaction, entertaining one\nanother with a recapitulation of their former adventures at the\ngarrison. In the afternoon, Gauntlet taking his leave, in order to write\na letter to his sister, at the desire of his uncle who, finding his end\napproaching, wanted to see her without loss of time, Peregrine made his\nappearance on the Bare, and was complimented on his coming abroad again,\nnot only by his old messmates, who had not seen him for many weeks, but\nby a number of those objects whom his liberality had fed, before his\nfunds were exhausted. Hatchway was, by his interest with the warden,\nput in possession of his former quarters, and Pipes despatched to make\ninquiry about Crabtree at his former lodging, where he learned that\nthe misanthrope, after a very severe fit of illness, was removed to\nKensington Gravel-pits, for the convenience of breathing a purer air\nthan that of London.\n\nIn consequence of this information, Peregrine, who knew the narrowness\nof the old gentleman's fortune, next day desired his friend Gauntlet to\ntake the trouble of visiting him, in his name, with a letter, in which\nhe expressed great concern for his indisposition, gave him notice of the\nfortunate intelligence he had received from the Downs, and conjured\nhim to make use of his purse, if he was in the least hampered in his\ncircumstances. The captain took coach immediately, and set out for the\nplace, according to the direction which Pipes had procured.\n\nCadwallader, having seen him at Bath, knew him again at first sight;\nand, though reduced to a skeleton, believed himself in such a fair\nway of doing well, that he would have accompanied him to the Fleet\nimmediately, had he not been restrained by his nurse, who was, by his\nphysician, invested with full authority to dispute and oppose his will\nin everything that she should think prejudicial to his health; for he\nwas considered, by those who had the care of him, as an old humourist,\nnot a little distempered in his brain. He inquired particularly about\nthe sailors, who, he said, had deterred him from carrying on his\nusual correspondence with Pickle, and been the immediate cause of his\nindisposition, by terrifying him into a fever. Understanding that the\nbreach between Pickle and Hatchway was happily cemented, and that he was\nno longer in any danger from the lieutenant's resentment, he promised\nto be at the Fleet with the first convenient opportunity; and, in the\nmeantime, wrote an answer to Peregrine's letter, importing, that he was\nobliged to him for his offer, but had not the least occasion for his\nassistance.\n\nIn a few days, our adventurer recovered his vigour, complexion, and\nvivacity; he mingled again in the diversions and parties of the place;\nand he received, in a little time, the money he had lent upon bottomry,\nwhich, together with the interest, amounted to upwards of eleven hundred\npounds. The possession of this sum, while it buoyed up his spirits,\ninvolved him in perplexity. Sometimes he thought it was incumbent\non him, as a man of honour, to employ the greatest part of it in\ndiminishing the debt for which he suffered; on the other hand, he\nconsidered that obligation effaced, by the treacherous behaviour of his\ncreditor, who had injured him to ten times the value of the sum; and,\nin these sentiments, entertained thoughts of attempting his escape from\nprison, with a view of conveying himself, with the shipwreck of\nhis fortune, to another country, in which he might use it to better\nadvantage.\n\nBoth suggestions were attended with such doubts and difficulties, that\nhe hesitated between them, and for the present laid out a thousand\npounds in stock, the interest of which, together with the fruits of his\nown industry, he hoped, would support him above want in his confinement,\nuntil something should occur that would point out the expediency of some\nother determination. Gauntlet still insisted upon having the honour of\nobtaining his liberty, at the expense of taking up his notes to Gleanum,\nand exhorted him to purchase a commission with part of the money which\nhe had retrieved. The lieutenant affirmed, that it was his privilege\nto procure the release of his cousin Pickle, because he enjoyed a\nvery handsome sum by his aunt, which of right belonged to the young\ngentleman, to whom he was, moreover, indebted for the use of his\nfurniture, and for the very house that stood over his head; and that,\nalthough he had already made a will in his favour, he should never be\nsatisfied, nor easy in his mind, so long as he remained deprived of his\nliberty, and wanted any of the conveniences of life.\n\nCadwallader, who by this time assisted at their councils, and was best\nacquainted with the peculiarity and unbending disposition of the youth,\nproposed, that, seeing he was so averse to obligations, Mr. Hatchway\nshould purchase of him the garrison with its appendages, which, at a\nmoderate price, would sell for more money than would be sufficient to\ndischarge his debts; that, if the servile subordination of the army\ndid not suit his inclinations, he might, with his reversion, buy a\ncomfortable annuity, and retire with him to the country, where he might\nlive absolutely independent, and entertain himself, as usual, with the\nridiculous characters of mankind.\n\nThis plan was to Pickle less disagreeable than any other project which\nas yet had been suggested; and the lieutenant declared himself ready to\nexecute his part of it without delay; but the soldier was mortified at\nthe thoughts of seeing his assistance unnecessary, and eagerly objected\nto the retirement, as a scheme that would blast the fairest promises\nof fame and fortune, and bury his youth and talents in solitude and\nobscurity. This earnest opposition on the part of Gauntlet hindered\nour adventurer from forming any immediate resolution, which was also\nretarded by his unwillingness to part with the garrison upon any terms,\nbecause he looked upon it as a part of his inheritance, which he could\nnot dispose of without committing an insult upon the memory of the\ndeceased commodore.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER CIII.\n\n\n\nHe is engaged in a very extraordinary Correspondence, which is\ninterrupted by a very unexpected Event.\n\n\nWhile this affair was in agitation, the captain told him in the course\nof conversation, that Emilia was arrived in town, and had inquired about\nMr. Pickle with such an eagerness of concern, as seemed to proclaim that\nshe was in some measure informed of his misfortune: he therefore\ndesired to know if he might be allowed to make her acquainted with\nhis situation, provided he should be again importuned by her on that\nsubject, which he had at first industriously waived. This proof, or\nrather presumption, of her sympathizing regard, did not fail to operate\npowerfully upon the bosom of Peregrine, which was immediately filled\nwith those tumults which love, ill-stifled, frequently excites. He\nobserved, that his disgrace was such as could not be effectually\nconcealed; therefore he saw no reason for depriving himself of Emilia's\ncompassion, since he was for ever excluded from her affection; and\ndesired Godfrey to present to his sister the lowly respects of a\ndespairing lover.\n\nBut, notwithstanding his declaration of despondence on this head, his\nimagination involuntarily teemed with more agreeable ideas. The proposal\nof Crabtree had taken root in his reflection, and he could not help\nforming plans of pastoral felicity in the arms of the lovely Emilia,\nremote from those pompous scenes which he now detested and despised.\nHe amused his fancy with the prospect of being able to support her in a\nstate of independency, by means of the slender annuity which it was\nin his power to purchase, together with the fruits of those endeavours\nwhich would profitably employ his vacant hours; and foresaw provision\nfor his growing family in the friendship of the lieutenant, who had\nalready constituted him his heir. He even parcelled out his hours among\nthe necessary cares of the world, the pleasures of domestic bliss, and\nthe enjoyments of a country life; and spent the night in ideal parties\nwith his charming bride, sometimes walking by the sedgy bank of some\ntransparent stream, sometimes pruning the luxuriant vine, and sometimes\nsitting in social converse with her in a shady grove of his own\nplanting.\n\nThese, however, were no more than the shadowy phantoms of imagination,\nwhich, he well knew, would never be realized: not that he believed such\nhappiness unattainable by a person in his circumstances, but because he\nwould not stoop to propose a scheme which might, in any shape, seem to\ninterfere with the interest of Emilia, or subject himself to a repulse\nfrom that young lady, who had rejected his addresses in the zenith of\nhis fortune.\n\nWhile he diverted himself with these agreeable reveries, an unexpected\nevent intervened, in which she and her brother were deeply interested.\nThe uncle was tapped for the dropsy, and died in a few days after the\noperation, having bequeathed, in his will, five thousand pounds to his\nnephew, and twice that sum to his niece, who had always enjoyed the\ngreatest share of his favour.\n\nIf our adventurer, before this occurrence, looked upon his love for\nEmilia as a passion which it was necessary, at any rate, to conquer or\nsuppress, he now considered her accession of fortune as a circumstance\nwhich confirmed that necessity, and resolved to discourage every thought\non that subject which should tend to the propagation of hope. One day,\nin the midst of a conversation calculated for the purpose, Godfrey put\ninto his hand a letter directed to Mr. Pickle, in the handwriting of\nEmilia, which the youth no sooner recognized, than his cheeks were\ncovered with a crimson dye, and he began to tremble with violent\nagitation; for he at once guessed the import of the billet, which he\nkissed with great reverence and devotion, and was not at all surprised\nwhen he read the following words:--\n\n     Sir,--I have performed a sufficient sacrifice to my\n     reputation, in retaining hitherto the appearance of that\n     resentment which I had long ago dismissed; and as the\n     late favourable change in my situation empowers me to\n     avow my genuine sentiments, without fear of censure, or\n     suspicion of mercenary design, I take this opportunity\n     to assure you, that, if I still maintain that place in\n     your heart which I was vain enough to think I once\n     possessed, I am willing to make the first advances to an\n     accommodation, and have actually furnished my brother\n     with full powers to conclude it in the name of your\n     appeased\n\n     \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmilia.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPickle, having kissed the subscription with great ardour, fell upon his\nknees, and lifting up his eyes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThank Heaven!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he, with an air\nof transport, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have not been mistaken in my opinion of that generous\nmaid. I believed her inspired with the most dignified and heroic\nsentiments, and now she gives me a convincing proof of her magnanimity.\nIt is now my business to approve myself worthy of her regard. May Heaven\ninflict upon me the keenest arrows of its vengeance, if I do not, at\nthis instant, contemplate the character of Emilia with the most perfect\nlove and adoration; yet, amiable and enchanting as she is, I am, more\nthan ever, determined to sacrifice the interest of my passion to my\nglory, though my life should fail in the contest; and even to refuse\nan offer, which, otherwise, the whole universe should not bribe me to\nforego.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis declaration was not so unexpected as unwelcome to his friend\nGauntlet, who represented that his glory was not at all interested in\nthe affair; because he had already vindicated his generosity in\nrepeated proffers to lay his whole fortune at Emilia's feet, when it\nwas impossible that anything selfish could enter into the proposal;\nbut that, in rejecting her present purpose, he would give the world\nan opportunity to say, that his pride was capricious, his obstinacy\ninvincible; and his sister would have undeniable reason to believe,\nthat either his passion for her was dissembled, or the ardour of it\nconsiderably abated.\n\nIn answer to these remonstrances, Pickle observed, that he had long\nset the world at defiance; and, as to the opinion of Emilia, he did not\ndoubt that she would applaud in her heart the resolution he had taken,\nand do justice to the purity of his intention. It was not an easy task\nto divert our hero from his designs at any time of life; but, since his\nconfinement, his inflexibility was become almost insurmountable. The\ncaptain, therefore, after having discharged his conscience, in assuring\nhim that his sister's happiness was at stake, that his mother had\napproved of the step she had taken, and that he himself should be\nextremely mortified at his refusal, forbore to press him with further\nargument, which served only to rivet him the more strongly in his own\nopinion, and undertook to deliver this answer to Emilia's letter:--\n\n     Madam,--That I revere the dignity of your virtue with the\n     utmost veneration, and love you infinitely more than life,\n     I am at all times ready to demonstrate; but the sacrifice\n     to honour it is now my turn to pay; and such is the rigour\n     of my destiny, that, in order to justify your generosity,\n     I must refuse to profit by your condescension. Madam, I am\n     doomed to be for ever wretched; and to sigh without ceasing\n     for the possession of that jewel, which, though now in my\n     offer, I dare not enjoy. I shall not pretend to express the\n     anguish that tears my heart, whilst I communicate this fatal\n     renunciation, but appeal to the delicacy of your own\n     sentiments, which can judge of my sufferings, and will,\n     doubtless, do justice to the self-denial of your forlorn\n                                         \u00e2\u0080\u009cP. Pickle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEmilia, who knew the nicety of our hero's pride, had foreseen the\npurport of this epistle before it came to her hands; she did not,\ntherefore, despair of success, nor desist from the prosecution of her\nplan, which was no other than that of securing her own happiness, in\nespousing the man upon whom she had fixed her unalterable affection.\nConfident of his honour, and fully satisfied of the mutual passion with\nwhich they were inspired, she gradually decoyed him into a literary\ncorrespondence, wherein she attempted to refute the arguments on which\nhe grounded his refusal; and, without doubt, the young gentleman was not\na little pleased with the enjoyment of such delightful commerce, in the\ncourse of which he had, more than ever, an opportunity of admiring the\npoignancy of her wit, and the elegance of her understanding.\n\nThe contemplation of such excellency, while it strengthened the chains\nwith which she held him enslaved, added emulation to the other motives\nthat induced him to maintain the dispute; and much subtlety of reasoning\nwas expended upon both sides of this very particular question, without\nany prospect of conviction on either part, till, at last, she began to\ndespair of making him a proselyte to her opinion by dint of argument;\nand resolved for the future to apply herself chiefly to the irresistible\nprepossessions of his love, which were not at all diminished or impaired\nby the essays of her pen. With this view she proposed a conference,\npretending that it was impossible to convey all her reflections upon\nthis subject in a series of short letters; and Godfrey undertook to bail\nhim for the day. But, conscious of her power, he would not trust himself\nin her presence, though his heart throbbed with all the eagerness of\ndesire to see her fair eyes disrobed of that resentment which they\nhad worn so long, and to enjoy the ravishing sweets of a fond\nreconciliation.\n\nNature could not have held out against such powerful attacks, had not\nthe pride and caprice of his disposition been gratified to the full in\nthe triumph of his resistance; he looked upon the contest as altogether\noriginal, and persevered with obstinacy, because he thought himself\nsure of favourable terms, whenever he should be disposed to\ncapitulate. Perhaps he might have overshot himself in the course of his\nperseverance. A young lady of Emilia's fortune and attractions could\nnot fail to find herself surrounded by temptations, which few women can\nresist. She might have misinterpreted the meaning of some paragraph or\ntaken umbrage at an unguarded expression in one of Peregrine's letters.\nShe might have been tired out by his obstinate peculiarity, or, at the\nlong run, construed it into madness, slight, or indifference; or, rather\nthan waste her prime in fruitless endeavours to subdue the pride of\na headstrong humourist, she might have listened to the voice of some\nadmirer, fraught with qualifications sufficient to engage her esteem and\naffection. But all these possibilities were providentially prevented by\nan accident attended with more important consequences than any we have\nhitherto recounted.\n\nEarly one morning Pipes was disturbed by the arrival of a messenger, who\nhad been sent express from the country by Mr. Clover, with a packet for\nthe lieutenant, and arrived in town overnight; but as he was obliged to\nhave recourse to the information of Jack's correspondent in the city,\ntouching the place of his abode, before he demanded entrance at the\nFleet the gate was shut; nor would the turnkeys admit him, although he\ntold them that he was charged with a message of the utmost consequence;\nso that he was fain to tarry till daybreak, when he, at his earnest\nsolicitation, was allowed to enter.\n\nHatchway, opening the packet, found a letter enclosed for Peregrine,\nwith an earnest request that he should forward it to the hands of that\nyoung gentleman with all possible despatch. Jack, who could not dive\ninto the meaning of this extraordinary injunction, began to imagine\nthat Mrs. Clover lay at the point of death, and wanted to take a last\nfarewell of her brother; and this conceit worked so strongly upon his\nimagination, that, while he huddled on his clothes, and made the best of\nhis way to the apartment of our hero, he could not help cursing, within\nhimself, the folly of the husband in sending such disagreeable messages\nto a man of Peregrine's impatient temper, already soured by his own\nuneasy situation. This reflection would have induced him to suppress the\nletter, had not he been afraid to tamper with the ticklish disposition\nof his friend, to whom, while he delivered it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs for my own part,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmayhap I may have as much natural affection as another, but\nwhen my spouse parted, I bore my misfortune like a British man, and a\nChristian. For why? He's no better than a fresh-water sailor, who knows\nnot how to stem the current of mischance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPickle being waked from a pleasant dream, in which the fair Emilia was\nprincipally concerned, and hearing this strange preamble, sat up in his\nbed, and unsealed the letter, in a state of mortification and disgust.\nBut what were the emotions of his soul, when he read the following\nintimation:--\n\n     Dear Brother,--It hath pleased God to take your father\n     suddenly off by a fit of apoplexy; and as he has died\n     intestate, I give you this notice, that you may, with all\n     speed, come down and take possession of your right, in\n     despite of Master Gam and his mother, who, you may be sure,\n     do not sit easy under this unexpected dispensation of\n     Providence. I have, by virtue of being a justice of the\n     peace, taken such precautions as I thought necessary for\n     your advantage; and the funeral shall be deferred until\n     your pleasure be known. Your sister, though sincerely\n     afflicted by her father's fate, submits to the will of\n     Heaven with laudable resignation, and begs you will set\n     out for this place without delay; in which request she is\n     joined by, sir, your affectionate brother, and humble\n     servant,                         \u00e2\u0080\u009cCharles Clover.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPeregrine at first looked upon this epistle as a mere illusion of the\nbrain, and a continuation of the reverie in which he had been engaged.\nHe read it ten times over, without being persuaded that he was actually\nawake. He rubbed his eyes, and shook his head, in order to shake off\nthe drowsy vapours that surrounded him. He hemmed thrice with great\nvociferation, snapped his fingers, tweaked his nose, started up from his\nbed, and, opening the casement, took a survey of the well-known\nobjects that appeared on each side of his habitation. Everything seemed\ncongruous and connected, and he said within himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSure this is the\nmost distinct dream that ever sleep produced.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then he had recourse\nagain to the paper, which he carefully perused, without finding any\nvariation from his first notion of the contents.\n\nHatchway, seeing all his extravagances of action, accompanied with a\nwild stare of distraction, began to believe that his head was at length\nfairly turned, and was really meditating means for securing his person,\nwhen Pickle, in a tone of surprise, exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood God! am I or am I\nnot awake?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy look ye, cousin Pickle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the lieutenant, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\nis a question which the deep sea-line of my understanding is not long\nenough to sound; but howsomever, thof I can't trust to the observation\nI have taken, it shall go hard but I will fall upon a way to guess\nwhereabouts we are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he lifted up a pitcher full of cold\nwater, that stood behind the outward door, and discharged it in the face\nof Peregrine without ceremony or hesitation. This remedy produced the\ndesired effect. Unpalatable as it was, the young gentleman no sooner\nrecovered his breath, which was endangered by such a sudden application,\nthan he thanked his friend Jack for the seasonable operation he had\nperformed. Having no longer any just reason to doubt the reality of\nwhat appeared so convincingly to his senses, he shifted himself on the\ninstant, not without hurry and trepidation; and, putting on his morning\ndress, sallied forth to the Bare, in order to deliberate with himself on\nthe important intelligence he had received.\n\nHatchway, not yet fully convinced of his sanity, and curious to know the\npurport of the letter, which had affected him in such an extraordinary\nmanner, carefully attended his footsteps in this excursion, in hope\nof being favoured with his confidence, in the course of their\nperambulation. Our hero no sooner appeared at the street door, than he\nwas saluted by the messenger, who having posted himself in the way for\nthat purpose, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod bless your noble honour, Squire Pickle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand give you joy of succeeding to your father's estate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These words\nhad scarce proceeded from his mouth, when the lieutenant, hopping\neagerly towards the countryman, squeezed his hand with great affection,\nand asked if the old gentleman had actually taken his departure. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\nMaster Hatchway,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the other, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin such a woundy haste, that he\nforgot to make a will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cBody of me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the seaman; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthese are\nthe best tidings I have ever heard since I first went to sea. Here, my\nlad, take my purse, and stow thyself chuck full of the best liquor\nin the land.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So saying, he tipped the peasant with ten pieces, and\nimmediately the whole place echoed the sound of Tom's instrument.\nPeregrine, repairing to the walk, communicated the billet to his honest\nfriend, who at his desire went forthwith to the lodgings of Captain\nGauntlet, and returned in less than an hour with that gentleman, who, I\nneed not say, was heartily rejoiced at the occasion.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER CIV.\n\n\n\nPeregrine holds a Consultation with his Friends, in consequence of\nwhich he bids Adieu to the Fleet--He arrives at his Father's House, and\nasserts his Right of Inheritance.\n\n\nNor did our hero keep the misanthrope in ignorance of this happy turn of\nfortune. Pipes was despatched to the senior, with a message requesting\nhis immediate presence; and he accordingly appeared, in obedience to the\nsummons, growling with discontent for having been deprived of several\nhours of his natural rest. His mouth was immediately stopped with the\nletter, at which he \u00e2\u0080\u009csmiled horribly a ghastly grin;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and, after a\ncompliment of gratulation, they entered into close divan, about the\nmeasures to be taken in consequence of this event.\n\nThere was no room for much debate. It was unanimously agreed that Pickle\nshould set out with all possible despatch for the garrison, to which\nGauntlet and Hatchway resolved to attend him. Pipes was accordingly\nordered to prepare a couple of post-chaises, while Godfrey went to\nprocure bail for his friend, and provide them with money for the expense\nof the expedition; but not before he was desired by Peregrine to\nconceal this piece of news from his sister, that our youth might have\nan opportunity to surprise her in a more interesting manner, after he\nshould have settled his affairs.\n\nAll these previous steps being taken, in less than an hour our hero took\nhis leave of the Fleet, after he had left twenty guineas with the warden\nfor the relief of the poor prisoners, a great number of whom conveyed\nhim to the gate, pouring forth prayers for his long life and prosperity;\nand he took the road to the garrison, in the most elevated transports of\njoy, unallayed with the least mixture of grief at the death of a parent\nwhose paternal tenderness he had never known. His breast was absolutely\na stranger to that boasted storm, or instinct of affection, by which\nthe charities are supposed to subsist.\n\nOf all the journeys he had ever made, this, sure, was the most\ndelightful. He felt all the ecstasy that must naturally be produced in a\nyoung man of his imagination, from such a sudden transition in point of\ncircumstance, he found himself delivered from confinement and disgrace,\nwithout being obliged to any person upon earth for his deliverance; he\nhad it now in his power to retort the contempt of the world in a manner\nsuited to his most sanguine wish; he was reconciled to his friend, and\nenabled to gratify his love, even upon his own terms; and saw himself\nin possession of a fortune more ample than his first inheritance, with\na stock of experience that would steer him clear of all those quicksands\namong which he had been formerly wrecked.\n\nIn the middle of their journey, while they halted at an inn for a short\nrefreshment and change of horses, a postilion running up to Peregrine in\nthe yard, fell at his feet, clasped his knees with great eagerness\nand agitation, and presented to him the individual face of his old\nvalet-de-chambre. The youth perceiving him in such an abject garb and\nattitude, commanded him to rise and tell the cause of such a miserable\nreverse in his fortune. Upon which Hadgi gave him to understand, that he\nhad been ruined by his wife, who, having robbed him of all his cash\nand valuable effects, had eloped from his house with one of his own\ncustomers, who appeared in the character of a French count, but was in\nreality no other than an Italian fiddler; that, in consequence of this\nretreat, he, the husband, was disabled from paying a considerable sum\nwhich he had set apart for his wine merchant, who being disappointed in\nhis expectation, took out an execution against his effects; and the\nrest of his creditors following his example, hunted him out of house\nand home. So that, finding his person in danger at London, he had been\nobliged to escape into the country, skulking about from one village to\nanother, till, being quite destitute of all support, he had undertaken\nhis present office, to save himself from starving.\n\nPeregrine listened with compassion to his lamentable tale, which too\nwell accounted for his not appearing in the Fleet, with offers of\nservice to his master in distress; a circumstance that Pickle had all\nalong imputed to his avarice and ingratitude. He assured him, that, as\nhe had been the means of throwing in his way the temptation to which\nhe fell a sacrifice, he would charge himself with the retrieval of his\naffairs. In the meantime, he made him taste of his bounty, and desired\nhim to continue in his present employment until he should return from\nthe garrison, when he would consider his situation, and do something for\nhis immediate relief.\n\nHadgi attempted to kiss his shoe, and wept, or affected to weep, with\nsensibility at this gracious reception; he even made a merit of his\nunwillingness to exercise his new occupation, and earnestly begged that\nhe might be allowed to give immediate attendance upon his dear master,\nfrom whom he could not bear the thoughts of a second parting. His\nentreaties were reinforced by the intercession of his two friends, in\nconsequence of which the Swiss was permitted to follow them at his own\nleisure, while they set forward after a slight repast, and reached the\nplace of their destination before ten o'clock at night.\n\nPeregrine, instead of alighting at the garrison, rode straightway to\nhis father's house; and no person appearing to receive him, not even a\nservant to take care of his chaise, he dismounted without assistance.\nBeing followed by his two friends, he advanced into the hall, where\nperceiving a bell-rope, he made immediate application to it in such a\nmanner as brought a couple of footmen into his presence. After having\nreprimanded them, with a stern look, for their neglect in point of\nattendance, he commanded them to show him into an apartment; and as they\nseemed unwilling to yield obedience to his orders, asked if they did not\nbelong to the family?\n\nOne of them, who took upon himself the office of spokesman, replied with\na sullen air, that they had been in the service of old Mr. Pickle, and\nnow that he was dead, thought themselves bound to obey nobody but their\nlady, and her son Mr. Gamaliel. This declaration had scarce proceeded\nfrom his mouth, when our hero gave them to understand, that since\nthey were not disposed to own any other master, they must change\ntheir quarters immediately. He ordered them to decamp without further\npreparation; and, as they still continued restive, they were kicked\nout of doors by the captain and his friend Hatchway. Squire Gam, who\noverheard everything that passed, and was now more than ever inflamed\nwith that rancour which he had sucked with his mother's milk, flew to\nthe assistance of his adherents, with a pistol in each hand, bellowing\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThieves! Thieves!\u00e2\u0080\u009d with great vociferation, as if he had mistaken the\nbusiness of the strangers, and actually believed himself in danger of\nbeing robbed. Under this pretence he discharged a piece at his brother,\nwho luckily escaped the shot, closed with him in a moment, and, wresting\nthe other pistol from his grip, turned him out into the courtyard, to\nthe consolation of his two dependents.\n\nBy this time, Pipes and the two postilions had taken possession of\nthe stables, without being opposed by the coachman and his deputy, who\nquietly submitted to the authority of their new sovereign. But the noise\nof the pistol had alarmed Mrs. Pickle, who, running downstairs, with the\nmost frantic appearance, attended by two maids and the curate, who still\nmaintained his place of chaplain and ghostly director in the family,\nwould have assaulted our hero with her nails, had not she been\nrestrained by her attendants. Though they prevented her from using her\nhands, they could not hinder her from exercising her tongue, which she\nwagged against him with all the virulence of malice. She asked, if he\nwere come to butcher his brother, to insult his father's corpse,\nand triumph in her affliction? She bestowed upon him the epithets of\nspendthrift, jail-bird, and unnatural ruffian; she begged pardon of God\nfor having brought such a monster into the world; accused him of having\nbrought his father's grey hairs with sorrow to the grave; and affirmed,\nthat were he to touch the body, it would bleed at his approach.\n\nWithout pretending to refute the articles of this ridiculous charge, he\nallowed her to ring out her alarm; and then calmly replied, that if she\ndid not quietly retire to her chamber, and behave as became a person\nin her present situation, he should insist upon her removing to another\nlodging without delay; for he was determined to be master in his own\nfamily. The lady, who, in all probability, expected that he would\nendeavour to appease her with all the tenderness of filial submission,\nwas so much exasperated at his cavalier behaviour, that her constitution\ncould not support the transports of her spirits; and she was carried off\nby her women in a fit, while the officious clergyman was dismissed after\nhis pupil, with all the circumstances of disgrace.\n\nOur hero having thus made his quarters good, took possession of the best\napartment in the house, and sent notice of his arrival to Mr. Clover,\nwho, with his wife, visited him in less than an hour, and was not a\nlittle surprised to find him so suddenly settled in his father's house.\nThe meeting of Julia and her brother was extremely pathetic. She had\nalways loved him with uncommon tenderness, and looked upon him as the\nornament of her family; but she had heard of his extravagances with\nregret, and though she considered the stories that were circulated\nat his expense, as the malicious exaggerations of his mother and her\ndarling son, her apprehension had been grievously alarmed by an account\nof his imprisonment and distress, which had been accidentally conveyed\nto that country by a gentleman from London, who had been formerly of his\nacquaintance; she could not, therefore, without the most tender emotions\nof joy, see him, as it were, restored to his rightful inheritance, and\nre-established in that station of life which she thought he could fill\nwith dignity and importance.\n\nAfter their mutual expressions of affection, she retired to her\nmother's chamber, with a view to make a second offer of her service\nand attendance, which had been already rejected with scorn since her\nfather's death; while Peregrine consulted his brother-in-law about the\naffairs of the family, so far as they had fallen within his cognizance\nand observation. Mr. Clover told him, that, though he was never favoured\nwith the confidence of the defunct, he knew some of his intimates, who\nhad been tampered with by Mrs. Pickle, and even engaged to second the\nremonstrances by which she had often endeavoured to persuade her husband\nto settle his affairs by a formal will; but that he had from time\nto time evaded their importunities with surprising excuses of\nprocrastination, that plainly appeared to be the result of invention\nand design, far above the supposed pitch of his capacity; a circumstance\nfrom which Mr. Clover concluded, that the old gentleman imagined his\nlife would not have been secure, had he once taken such a step as would\nhave rendered it unnecessary to the independence of his second son.\nHe moreover observed, that, in consequence of this information, he no\nsooner heard of Mr. Pickle's death, which happened at the club, than he\nwent directly with a lawyer to his house, before any cabal or conspiracy\ncould be formed against the rightful heir; and, in presence of witnesses\nprovided for the purpose, sealed up all the papers of the deceased,\nafter the widow had, in the first transports of her sorrow and vexation,\nfairly owned that her husband had died intestate.\n\nPeregrine was extremely well satisfied with this intelligence, by which\nall his doubts were dispelled; and, having cheerfully supped with his\nfriends on a cold collation, which his brother-in-law had brought in his\nchariot, they retired to rest, in different chambers, after Julia had\nmet with another repulse from her capricious mother, whose overflowing\nrage had now subsided into the former channel of calm inveteracy. Next\nmorning the house was supplied with some servants from the garrison, and\npreparations were made for the funeral of the deceased. Gam having taken\nlodgings in the neighbourhood, came with a chaise and cart to demand\nhis mother, together with his own clothes, and her personal effects.\nOur hero, though he would not suffer him to enter the door, allowed\nhis proposal to be communicated to the widow, who eagerly embraced the\nopportunity of removing, and was, with her own baggage, and that of\nher beloved son, conveyed to the place which he had prepared for her\nreception. Thither she was followed by her woman, who was desired by\nPeregrine to assure her mistress, that, until a regular provision could\nbe settled upon her, she might command him, in point of money, or any\nother accommodation in his power.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER CV.\n\n\n\nHe performs the last Offices to his Father, and returns to London, upon\na very interesting Design.\n\n\nSuits of mourning being provided for himself, his friends and adherents,\nand every other previous measure taken suitable to the occasion, his\nfather was interred, in a private manner, in the parish church; and\nhis papers being examined, in presence of many persons of honour and\nintegrity, invited for that purpose, no will was found, or any other\ndeed, in favour of the second son, though it appeared by the marriage\nsettlement, that the widow was entitled to a jointure of five hundred\npounds a year. The rest of his papers consisted of East India bonds,\nSouth Sea annuities, mortgages, notes, and assignments, to the amount\nof four score thousand seven hundred and sixty pounds, exclusive of\nthe house, plate and furniture, horses, equipage, and cattle, with the\ngarden and park adjacent, to a very considerable extent.\n\nThis was a sum that even exceeded his expectation, and could not fail\nto entertain his fancy with the most agreeable ideas. He found himself\nimmediately a man of vast consequence among his country neighbours, who\nvisited him with compliments of congratulation, and treated him with\nsuch respect as would have effectually spoiled any young man of his\ndisposition, who had not the same advantages of experience as he had\nalready purchased at a very extravagant price. Thus shielded with\ncaution, he bore his prosperity with surprising temperance; everybody\nwas charmed with his affability and moderation. When he made a circuit\nround the gentlemen of the district, in order to repay the courtesy\nwhich he owed, he was caressed by them with uncommon assiduity, and\nadvised to offer himself as a candidate for the county at the next\nelection, which, they supposed, would soon happen, because the present\nmember was in a declining state of health. Nor did his person and\naddress escape unheeded by the ladies, many of whom did not scruple to\nspread their attractions before him, with a view of captivating such\na valuable prize: nay, such an impression did this legacy make upon\na certain peer, who resided in this part of the country, that he\ncultivated Pickle's acquaintance with great eagerness, and, without\ncircumlocution, offered to him in marriage his only daughter, with a\nvery considerable fortune.\n\nOur hero expressed himself upon this occasion as became a man of\nhonour, sensibility, and politeness, and frankly gave his lordship to\nunderstand, that his heart was already engaged. He was pleased with the\nopportunity of making such a sacrifice of his passion for Emilia, which,\nby this time, inflamed his thoughts to such a degree of impatience, that\nhe resolved to depart for London with all possible speed; and for\nthat purpose industriously employed almost every hour of his time in\nregulating his domestic affairs. He paid off all his father's servants,\nand hired others, at the recommendation of his sister, who promised\nto superintend his household in his absence. He advanced the first\nhalf-yearly payment of his mother's jointure; and as for his brother\nGam, he gave him divers opportunities of acknowledging his faults, so\nthat he might have answered to his own conscience for taking any step in\nhis favour; but that young gentleman was not yet sufficiently humbled\nby misfortune, and not only forbore to make any overtures of peace, but\nalso took all occasions to slander the conduct and revile the person of\nour hero, being in this practice comforted and abetted by his righteous\nmamma.\n\nEverything being thus settled for the present, the triumvirate set out\non their return to town in the same manner with that in which they had\narrived in the country, except in this small variation, that Hatchway's\nchaise-companion was now the valet-de-chambre refitted, instead of\nPipes, who, with another lacquey, attended them on horseback. When\nthey had performed two-thirds of their way to London, they chanced to\novertake a country squire, on his return from a visit to one of his\nneighbours, who had entertained him with such hospitality, that, as the\nlieutenant observed, he rolled himself almost gunwale to every motion\nof his horse, which was a fine hunter; and when the chaise passed him\nat full speed, he set up the sportsman's halloo, in a voice that sounded\nlike a French horn, clapping spurs to Sorrel at the same time, in order\nto keep up with the pace of the machine.\n\nPeregrine, who was animated with an uncommon flow of spirits, ordered\nhis postilion to proceed more softly; and entered into conversation with\nthe stranger, touching the make and mettle of his horse, upon which he\ndescanted with so much learning, that the squire was astonished at his\nknowledge. When they approached his habitation, he invited the young\ngentleman and his company to halt, and drink a bottle of his ale;\nand was so pressing in his solicitation, that they complied with his\nrequest. He accordingly conducted them through a spacious avenue, that\nextended as far as the highway, to the gate of a large chateau, of a\nmost noble and venerable appearance, which induced them to alight and\nview the apartments, contrary to their first intention of drinking a\nglass of his October at the door.\n\nThe rooms were every way suitable to the magnificence of the outside,\nand our hero imagined they had made a tour through the whole sweep, when\nthe landlord gave him to understand that they had not yet seen the\nbest apartment of the house, and immediately led them into a spacious\ndining-room, which Peregrine did not enter without giving manifest\nsigns of uncommon astonishment. The panels all round were covered with\nportraits at full length, by Vandyke; and not one of them appeared\nwithout a ridiculous tie-periwig, in the style of those that usually\nhang over the shops of twopenny barbers. The straight boots in which\nthe figures had been originally painted, and the other circumstances of\nattitude and drapery, so inconsistent with this monstrous furniture of\nthe head, exhibited such a ludicrous appearance, that Pickle's wonder,\nin a little time, gave way to his mirth, and he was seized with a\nviolent fit of laughter, which had well-nigh deprived him of his breath.\n\nThe squire, half-pleased and half-offended at this expression of\nridicule, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat makes you laugh so woefully; you\nthink it strange to zee my vorefathers booted and spurred, with huge\nthree-tailed periwigs on their pates. The truth of the matter is this: I\ncould not abide to zee the pictures of my vamily with a parcel of loose\nhair hanging about their eyes, like zo many colts; and zo I employed a\npainter vellow from Lundon to clap decent periwigs upon their skulls,\nat the rate of vive shillings a head, and offered him three shillings a\npiece to furnish each with a handsome pair of shoes and stockings: but\nthe rascal, thinking I must have 'em done at any price after their heads\nwere covered, haggled with me for four shillings a picture; and zo,\nrather than be imposed upon, I turned him off, and shall let 'em stand\nas they are, till zome more reasonable brother of the brush comes round\nthe country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPickle commended his resolution, though in his heart, he blessed himself\nfrom such a barbarous Goth; and, after they had despatched two or three\nbottles of his beer, they proceeded on their journey, and arrived in\ntown about eleven at night.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER CVI.\n\n\n\nHe enjoys an interview with Emilia, and makes himself ample Amends for\nall the Mortifications of his Life.\n\n\nGodfrey, who had taken leave of his sister, on pretence of making a\nshort excursion with Peregrine, whose health required the enjoyment of\nfresh air, after his long confinement, sent a message to her, that\nsame night, announcing his arrival, and giving her notice that he would\nbreakfast with her next morning; when he and our hero, who had dressed\nhimself for the purpose, taking a hackney-coach, repaired to her\nlodging, and were introduced into a parlour adjoining to that in which\nthe tea-table was set. Here they had not waited many minutes when they\nheard the sound of feet coming downstairs; upon which our hero's heart\nbegan to beat the alarm. He concealed himself behind the screen, by the\ndirection of his friend, whose ears being saluted with Sophy's voice\nfrom the next room, he flew into it with great ardour, and enjoyed upon\nher lips the sweet transports of a meeting so unexpected; for he had\nleft her in her father's house at Windsor.\n\nAmidst these emotions, he had almost forgotten the situation of\nPeregrine; when Emilia, assuming her enchanting air: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs not this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nshe, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca most provoking scene to a young woman like me, who am doomed\nto wear the willow, by the strange caprice of my lover? Upon my word,\nbrother, you have done me infinite prejudice, in promoting this jaunt\nwith my obstinate correspondent; who, I suppose, is so ravished with\nthis transient glimpse of liberty, that he will never be persuaded\nto incur unnecessary confinement for the future.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear sister,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n replied the captain tauntingly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour own pride set him the example; so\nyou must e'en stand to the consequence of his imitation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009c'Tis a hard\ncase, however,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the fair offender, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I should suffer all\nmy life, by one venial trespass. Heigh ho! who would imagine that\na sprightly girl, such as I, with ten thousand pounds, should go a\nbegging? I have a good mind to marry the next person that asks me the\nquestion, in order to be revenged upon this unyielding humourist. Did\nthe dear fellow discover no inclination to see me, in all the term of\nhis releasement? Well, if ever I can catch the fugitive again, he shall\nsing in his cage for life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt is impossible to convey to the reader a just idea of Peregrine's\ntransports, while he overheard this declaration; which was no sooner\npronounced, than, unable to resist the impetuosity of his passion,\nhe sprung from his lurking-place, exclaiming, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere I surrender!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\nrushing into her presence, was so dazzled with her beauty, that his\nspeech failed. He was fixed like a statue to the floor; and all his\nfaculties were absorbed in admiration. Indeed, she was now in the full\nbloom of her charms, and it was nearly impossible to look upon her\nwithout emotion. What then must have been the ecstasy of our youth,\nwhose passion was whetted with all the incitements which could stimulate\nthe human heart! The ladies screamed with surprise at his appearance,\nand Emilia underwent such agitation as flushed every charm with\nirresistible energy: her cheeks glowed with a most delicate suffusion,\nand her bosom heaved with such bewitching undulation, that the cambric\ncould not conceal or contain the snowy hemispheres, that rose like a\nvision of paradise to his view.\n\nWhile he was almost fainting with unutterable delight, she seemed to\nsink under the tumults of tenderness and confusion; when our hero,\nperceiving her condition, obeyed the impulse of his love, and circled\nthe charmer in his arms, without suffering the least frown or symptom\nof displeasure. Not all the pleasures of his life had amounted to the\nineffable joy of this embrace, in which he continued for some minutes\ntotally entranced. He fastened upon her pouting lips with all the\neagerness of rapture; and, while his brain seemed to whirl round with\ntransport, exclaimed, in a delirium of bliss, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHeaven and earth! this is\ntoo much to bear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis imagination was accordingly relieved, and his attention in some\nmeasure divided, by the interposition of Sophy, who kindly chid him for\nhis having overlooked his old friends. Thus accosted, he quitted his\ndelicious armful, and, saluting Mrs. Gauntlet, asked pardon for his\nneglect; observing that such rudeness was excusable, considering the\nlong and unhappy exile which he had suffered from the jewel of his\nsoul. Then turning to Emilia, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am come, madam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto claim\nthe performance of your promise, which I can produce under your own\nfair hand. You may, therefore, lay aside all superfluous ceremony and\nshyness, and crown my happiness without further delay; for, upon my\nsoul! my thoughts are wound up to the last pitch of expectation, and\nI shall certainly run distracted, if I am doomed to any term of\nprobation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis mistress having by this time recollected herself, replied, with a\nmost exhilarating smile, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI ought to punish you for your obstinacy\nwith the mortification of a twelvemonth's trial; but it is dangerous to\ntamper with an admirer of your disposition, and therefore, I think, I\nmust make sure of you while it is in my power.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are willing\nthen to take me for better, for worse, in presence of heaven and these\nwitnesses?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Peregrine kneeling, and applying her hand to his lips.\nAt this interrogation, her features softened into an amazing expression\nof condescending love; and, while she darted a side glance that thrilled\nto his marrow, and heaved a sigh more soft than Zephyr's balmy wing, her\nanswer was, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy--ay--and heaven grant me patience to bear the humours\nof such a yoke-fellow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd may the same powers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the youth,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cgrant me life and opportunity to manifest the immensity of my\nlove. Meanwhile, I have eighty thousand pounds, which shall be laid\nimmediately in your lap.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he sealed the contract upon her lips, and explained the\nmystery of his last words, which had begun to operate upon the wonder of\nthe two sisters. Sophy was agreeably surprised with the account of his\ngood fortune; nor was it, in all probability, unacceptable to the\nlovely Emilia; though, from this information, she took an opportunity\nto upbraid her admirer with the inflexibility of his pride, which,\nshe scrupled not to say, would have baffled all the suggestions of his\npassion, had it not been gratified by this providential event.\n\nMatters being thus happily matured, the lover begged that immediate\nrecourse might be had to the church, and his happiness ascertained\nbefore night. But the bride objected with great vehemence to such\nprecipitation, being desirous of her mother's presence at the ceremony;\nand she was seconded in her opinion by her brother's wife. Peregrine,\nmaddening with desire, assaulted her with the most earnest entreaties,\nrepresenting, that, as her mother's consent was already obtained, there\nwas surely no necessity for delay, that must infallibly make a dangerous\nimpression upon his brain and constitution. He fell at her feet in\nall the agony of impatience; and swore his life and intellects would\nactually be in jeopardy by her refusal; and, when she attempted to argue\nhim out of his demand, began to rage with such extravagance, that Sophy\nwas frightened into conviction; and Godfrey enforcing the remonstrances\nof his friend, the amiable Emilia was teased into compliance.\n\nAfter breakfast the bridegroom and his companion set out for the Commons\nfor a licence, having first agreed upon the house at which the ceremony\nshould be performed, in the lodgings of the bride; and the permission\nbeing obtained, they found means to engage a clergyman, who undertook to\nattend them at their own time and place. Then a ring was purchased for\nthe occasion; and they went in search of the lieutenant, with whom they\ndined at a tavern, and not only made him acquainted with the steps they\nhad taken, but desired that he would stand godfather to the bride:\nan employment which Jack accepted with demonstrations of particular\nsatisfaction; till chancing to look into the street, and seeing\nCadwallader approach the door, in consequence of a message they had sent\nto him by Pipes, he declined the office in favour of the senior, who was\naccordingly ordained for that purpose, on the supposition that such\na mark of regard might facilitate his concurrence with a match, which\notherwise he would certainly oppose, as he was a professed enemy to\nwedlock, and, as yet, ignorant of Peregrine's intention.\n\nAfter having congratulated Pickle upon his succession, and shook his two\nfriends by the hand, the misanthrope asked whose mare was dead, that he\nwas summoned in such a plaguy hurry from his dinner, which he had been\nfain to gobble up like a cannibal? Our hero gave him to understand, that\nthey had made an appointment to drink tea with two agreeable ladies,\nand were unwilling that he should lose the opportunity of enjoying an\nentertainment which he loved so much. Crabtree, shrivelling up his face\nlike an autumn leaf at this intimation, cursed his complaisance, and\nswore they should keep their assignation without him; for he and lechery\nhad shaken hands many years ago.\n\nThe bridegroom, however, likening him unto an old coachman who still\ndelights in the smack of the whip, and dropping some flattering hints\nof his manhood, even at these years, he was gradually prevailed upon to\naccompany them to the place of rendezvous; where, being ushered into a\ndining-room, they had not waited three minutes, when they were joined by\nthe parson, who had observed the hour with great punctuality.\n\nThis gentleman no sooner entered the room, than Cadwallader, in a\nwhisper to Gauntlet, asked if that was not the cock-b--d; and, before\nthe captain could make any reply, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat an unconscionable w-- master the\nrogue is!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cscarce discharged from confinement, and sweetened\nwith a little fresh air, when he wenches with a pimp in canonicals in\nhis pay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The door again opened, and Emilia broke in upon them,\nwith such dignity of mien, and divinity of aspect, as inspired every\nspectator with astonishment and admiration. The lieutenant, who had not\nseen her since her charms were ripened into such perfection, expressed\nhis wonder and approbation in an exclamation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdd's zooks! what\na glorious galley!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the misanthrope's visage was instantly\nmetamorphosed into the face of a mountain goat. He licked his lips\ninstinctively, snuffed the air, and squinted with a most horrible\nobliquity of vision.\n\nThe bride and her sister being seated, and Hatchway having renewed\nhis acquaintance with the former, who recognized him with particular\ncivility, Peregrine withdrew into another apartment with his friend\nCrabtree, to whom he imparted the design of his meeting; which the\nlatter no sooner understood, than he attempted to retreat, without\nmaking any other reply than that of \u00e2\u0080\u009cPshaw! rot your matrimony! can't\nyou put your neck in the noose, without my being a witness of your\nfolly?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young gentleman, in order to vanquish this aversion, stepped to the\ndoor of the next room, and begged the favour of speaking with Emilia,\nto whom he introduced the testy old bachelor as one of his particular\nfriends, who desired to have the honour of giving her away. The\nbewitching smile with which she received his salute, and granted his\nrequest, at once overcame the disapprobation of the misanthrope, who,\nwith a relaxation in his countenance, which had never been perceived\nbefore that instant, thanked her in the most polite terms for such\nan agreeable mark of distinction. He accordingly led her to the\ndining-room, where the ceremony was performed without delay; and after\nthe husband had asserted his prerogative on her lips, the whole company\nsaluted her by the name of Mrs. Pickle.\n\nI shall leave the sensible reader to judge what passed at this juncture\nwithin the bosoms of the new-married couple: Peregrine's heart was fired\nwith inexpressible ardour and impatience; while the transports of the\nbride were mingled with a dash of diffidence and apprehension. Gauntlet\nsaw it would be too much for both to bear their present tantalizing\nsituation till night, without some amusement to divert their thoughts;\nand therefore proposed to pass part of the evening at the public\nentertainments in Marylebone gardens, which were at that time frequented\nby the best company in town. The scheme was relished by the discreet\nSophy, who saw the meaning of the proposal, and the bride submitted\nto the persuasion of her sister; so that, after tea, two coaches were\ncalled, and Peregrine was forcibly separated from his charmer during the\nconveyance.\n\nThe new-married couple and their company having made shift to spend\nthe evening, and supped on a slight collation in one of the boxes,\nPeregrine's patience was almost quite exhausted, and taking Godfrey\naside, he imparted his intention to withdraw in private from the sea-wit\nof his friend Hatchway, who would otherwise retard his bliss with\nunseasonable impediments, which, at present, he could not possibly bear.\nGauntlet, who sympathized with his impatience, undertook to intoxicate\nthe lieutenant with bumpers to the joy of the bride, and, in the\nmeantime, desired Sophy to retire with his sister, under the auspices of\nCadwallader, who promised to squire them home.\n\nThe ladies were accordingly conducted to the coach, and Jack proposed\nto the captain, that, for the sake of the joke, the bridegroom should\nbe plied with liquor, in such a manner as would effectually disable him\nfrom enjoying the fruits of his good-fortune for one night at least.\nGauntlet seemed to relish the scheme, and they prevailed upon Pickle to\naccompany them to a certain tavern, on pretence of drinking a farewell\nglass to a single life: there the bottle was circulated, till Hatchway's\nbrain began to suffer innovation. As he had secured our hero's hat and\nsword, he felt no apprehension of an elopement, which, however, was\neffected; and the youth hastened on the wings of love to the arms of his\nenchanting bride. He found Crabtree in a parlour waiting for his return,\nand disposed to entertain him with a lecture upon temperance; to which\nhe paid very little attention, but ringing for Emilia's maid, desired to\nknow if her mistress was in bed. Being answered in the affirmative, he\nsent her up-stairs to announce his arrival, undressed himself to a loose\ngown and slippers, and, wishing the misanthrope good night, after having\ndesired to see him next day, followed in person to the delicious\nscene, where he found her elegantly dished out, the fairest daughter of\nchastity and love.\n\nWhen he approached, she was overwhelmed with confusion, and hid her\nlovely face from his transporting view. Mrs. Gauntlet, seeing his eyes\nkindled at the occasion, kissed her charming sister, who, throwing her\nsnowy arms about her neck, would have detained her in the room, had\nnot Peregrine gently disengaged her confidante from her embrace,\nand conducted her trembling to the door; which having bolted and\nbarricadoed, he profited by his good fortune, and his felicity was\nperfect.\n\nNext day he rose about noon, and found his three friends assembled, when\nhe learned that Jack had fallen in his own snare, and been obliged to\nlie in the same tavern where he fell; a circumstance of which he was so\nmuch ashamed, that Peregrine and his wife escaped many jokes, which he\nwould have certainly cracked, had he not lain under the imputation of\nthis disgrace. In half an hour after he came down, Mrs. Pickle appeared\nwith Sophy, blushing like Aurora or the goddess of health, and sending\nforth emanations of beauty unparalleled. She was complimented upon her\nchange of situation by all present, and by none more warmly than by\nold Crabtree, who declared himself so well satisfied with his friend's\nfortune, as to be almost reconciled to that institution, against which\nhe had declaimed during the best part of his life.\n\nAn express was immediately despatched to Mrs. Gauntlet, with an account\nof her daughter's marriage: a town-house was hired, and a handsome\nequipage set up, in which the new-married pair appeared at all public\nplaces, to the astonishment of our adventurer's fair-weather friends,\nand the admiration of all the world: for, in point of figure, such\nanother couple was not to be found in the whole United Kingdom. Envy\ndespaired, and detraction was struck dumb, when our hero's new accession\nof fortune was consigned to the celebration of public fame: Emilia\nattracted the notice of all observers, from the pert Templar to\nthe Sovereign himself, who was pleased to bestow encomiums upon the\nexcellence of her beauty. Many persons of consequence, who had dropped\nthe acquaintance of Peregrine in the beginning of his decline, now made\nopen efforts to cultivate his friendship anew; but he discouraged all\nthese advances with the most mortifying disdain; and one day when\nthe nobleman, whom he had formerly obliged, came up to him in the\ndrawing-room, with the salutation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour servant, Mr. Pickle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he eyed\nhim with a look of ineffable contempt, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose your lordship\nis mistaken in your man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and turned his head another way in presence of\nthe whole court.\n\nWhen he had made a circuit round all the places frequented by the\nbeau-monde, to the utter confusion of those against whom his resentment\nwas kindled; paid off his debts, and settled his money matters in town,\nHatchway was dismissed to the country, in order to prepare for the\nreception of his fair Emilia. In a few days after his departure, the\nwhole company, Cadwallader himself included, set out for his father's\nhouse, and, in their way, took up Mrs. Gauntlet, the mother, who was\nsincerely rejoiced to see our hero in the capacity of her son-in-law.\nFrom her habitation they proceeded homewards at an easy pace, and,\namidst the acclamations of the whole parish, entered their own house,\nwhere Emilia was received in the most tender manner by Mr. Clover's\nwife, who had provided everything for her ease and accommodation; and,\nnext day, surrendered unto her the management of her own household\naffairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle,\nVolume I, by Tobias Smollett\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PEREGRINE PICKLE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 4084-0.txt or 4084-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/4\/0\/8\/4084\/\n\nProduced by Tapio Riikonen\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":348,"split":"train"}
