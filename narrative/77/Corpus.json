{"ori_id":"11ac9bf7f55ee9d40df3c0ba117c6914dd6ed9e6","title":"A. J. Raffles","context":"A. J. Raffles\n The \"Raffles\" stories have two distinct phases. In the first phase, Raffles and Bunny are men-about-town who also commit burglaries. Raffles is a famous gentleman cricketer, a marvellous spin bowler who is often invited to social events that would be out of his reach otherwise. \"I was asked about for my cricket\", he comments after this period is over. It ends when they are caught and exposed on an ocean voyage while attempting another theft; Raffles dives overboard and is presumed drowned. These stories were collected in The Amateur Cracksman. Other stories set in this period, written after Raffles had been \"killed off\", were collected in A Thief in the Night.\nThe second phase begins some time later when Bunny\u00a0\u2013 having served a prison sentence\u00a0\u2013 is summoned to the house of a rich invalid. This turns out to be Raffles himself, back in England in disguise. Then begins their \"professional\" period, exiled from Society, in which they are straightforward thieves trying to earn a living while keeping Raffles's identity a secret. They finally volunteer for the Boer War, where Bunny is wounded and Raffles dies in battle after exposing an enemy spy. These stories were originally collected in The Black Mask, although they were subsequently published in one volume with the phase one stories. The last few stories in A Thief in the Night were set during this period as well.\nLike Sherlock Holmes after his disappearance into the Reichenbach Falls, Raffles was never quite the same after his reappearance. The \"classic\" Raffles elements are all found in the first stories: cricket, high society, West End clubs, Bond Street jewellers\u00a0\u2013 and two men in immaculate evening dress pulling off impossible robberies.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of A Thief in the Night, by E.

In so doing I may indeed fill some small part of an infinitely\ngreater blank, across which you may conceive me to have stretched my\ncanvas for the first frank portrait of my friend.  The whole truth\ncannot harm him now.  I shall paint in every wart.  Raffles was a\nvillain, when all is written; it is no service to his memory to glaze\nthe fact; yet I have done so myself before to-day.  I have omitted\nwhole heinous episodes.  I have dwelt unduly on the redeeming side.\nAnd this I may do again, blinded even as I write by the gallant glamour\nthat made my villain more to me than any hero.  But at least there\nshall be no more reservations, and as an earnest I shall make no\nfurther secret of the greatest wrong that even Raffles ever did me.\n\nI pick my words with care and pain, loyal as I still would be to my\nfriend, and yet remembering as I must those Ides of March when he led\nme blindfold into temptation and crime.  That was an ugly office, if\nyou will.  It was a moral bagatelle to the treacherous trick he was to\nplay me a few weeks later.  The second offence, on the other hand, was\nto prove the less serious of the two against society, and might in\nitself have been published to the world years ago.  There have been\nprivate reasons for my reticence.  The affair was not only too\nintimately mine, and too discreditable to Raffles.  One other was\ninvolved in it, one dearer to me than Raffles himself, one whose name\nshall not even now be sullied by association with ours.\n\nSuffice it that I had been engaged to her before that mad March deed.\nTrue, her people called it \"an understanding,\" and frowned even upon\nthat, as well they might.  But their authority was not direct; we bowed\nto it as an act of politic grace; between us, all was well but my\nunworthiness.  That may be gauged when I confess that this was how the\nmatter stood on the night I gave a worthless check for my losses at\nbaccarat, and afterward turned to Raffles in my need.  Even after that\nI saw her sometimes.  But I let her guess that there was more upon my\nsoul than she must ever share, and at last I had written to end it all.\nI remember that week so well!  It was the close of such a May as we had\nnever had since, and I was too miserable even to follow the heavy\nscoring in the papers.  Raffles was the only man who could get a wicket\nup at Lord's, and I never once went to see him play.  Against\nYorkshire, however, he helped himself to a hundred runs as well; and\nthat brought Raffles round to me, on his way home to the Albany.\n\n\"We must dine and celebrate the rare event,\" said he.  \"A century takes\nit out of one at my time of life; and you, Bunny, you look quite as\nmuch in need of your end of a worthy bottle.  Suppose we make it the\nCaf\u00c3\u00a9 Royal, and eight sharp?   I'll be there first to fix up the table\nand the wine.\"\n\nAnd at the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Royal I incontinently told him of the trouble I was in.\nIt was the first he had ever heard of my affair, and I told him all,\nthough not before our bottle had been succeeded by a pint of the same\nexemplary brand.  Raffles heard me out with grave attention.  His\nsympathy was the more grateful for the tactful brevity with which it\nwas indicated rather than expressed.  He only wished that I had told\nhim of this complication in the beginning; as I had not, he agreed with\nme that the only course was a candid and complete renunciation.  It was\nnot as though my divinity had a penny of her own, or I could earn an\nhonest one.  I had explained to Raffles that she was an orphan, who\nspent most of her time with an aristocratic aunt in the country, and\nthe remainder under the repressive roof of a pompous politician in\nPalace Gardens.  The aunt had, I believed, still a sneaking softness\nfor me, but her illustrious brother had set his face against me from\nthe first.\n\n\"Hector Carruthers!\" murmured Raffles, repeating the detested name with\nhis clear, cold eye on mine.  \"I suppose you haven't seen much of him?\"\n\n\"Not a thing for ages,\" I replied.  \"I was at the house two or three\ndays last year, but they've neither asked me since nor been at home to\nme when I've called.  The old beast seems a judge of men.\"\n\nAnd I laughed bitterly in my glass.\n\n\"Nice house?\" said Raffles, glancing at himself in his silver\ncigarette-case.\n\n\"Top shelf,\" said I.  \"You know the houses in Palace Gardens, don't\nyou?\"\n\n\"Not so well as I should like to know them, Bunny.\"\n\n\"Well, it's about the most palatial of the lot.  The old ruffian is as\nrich as Croesus.  It's a country-place in town.\"\n\n\"What about the window-fastenings?\" asked Raffles casually.\n\nI recoiled from the open cigarette-case that he proffered as he spoke.\nOur eyes met; and in his there was that starry twinkle of mirth and\nmischief, that sunny beam of audacious devilment, which had been my\nundoing two months before, which was to undo me as often as he chose\nuntil the chapter's end.  Yet for once I withstood its glamour; for\nonce I turned aside that luminous glance with front of steel.  There\nwas no need for Raffles to voice his plans.  I read them all between\nthe strong lines of his smiling, eager face.  And I pushed back my\nchair in the equal eagerness of my own resolve.\n\n\"Not if I know it!\" said I.  \"A house I've dined in--a house I've\n seen her in--a house where she stays by the month together!  Don't\nput it into words, Raffles, or I'll get up and go.\"\n\n\"You mustn't do that before the coffee and liqueur,\" said Raffles\nlaughing.  \"Have a small Sullivan first: it's the royal road to a\ncigar.  And now let me observe that your scruples would do you honor if\nold Carruthers still lived in the house in question.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say he doesn't?\"\n\nRaffles struck a match, and handed it first to me.  \"I mean to say, my\ndear Bunny, that Palace Gardens knows the very name no more.  You began\nby telling me you had heard nothing of these people all this year.\nThat's quite enough to account for our little misunderstanding. I was\nthinking of the house, and you were thinking of the people in the\nhouse.\"\n\n\"But who are they, Raffles?  Who has taken the house, if old Carruthers\nhas moved, and how do you know that it is still worth a visit?\"\n\n\"In answer to your first question--Lord Lochmaben,\" replied Raffles,\nblowing bracelets of smoke toward the ceiling.  \"You look as though you\nhad never heard of him; but as the cricket and racing are the only part\nof your paper that you condescend to read, you can't be expected to\nkeep track of all the peers created in your time.  Your other question\nis not worth answering.  How do you suppose that I know these things?\nIt's my business to get to know them, and that's all there is to it.\nAs a matter of fact, Lady Lochmaben has just as good diamonds as Mrs.\nCarruthers ever had; and the chances are that she keeps them where Mrs.\nCarruthers kept hers, if you could enlighten me on that point.\"\n\nAs it happened, I could, since I knew from his niece that it was one on\nwhich Mr. Carruthers had been a faddist in his time.  He had made quite\na study of the cracksman's craft, in a resolve to circumvent it with\nhis own.  I remembered myself how the ground-floor windows were\nelaborately bolted and shuttered, and how the doors of all the rooms\nopening upon the square inner hall were fitted with extra Yale locks,\nat an unlikely height, not to be discovered by one within the room.  It\nhad been the butler's business to turn and to collect all these keys\nbefore retiring for the night.  But the key of the safe in the study\nwas supposed to be in the jealous keeping of the master of the house\nhimself.  That safe was in its turn so ingeniously hidden that I never\nshould have found it for myself.  I well remember how one who showed it\nto me (in the innocence of her heart) laughed as she assured me that\neven her little trinkets were solemnly locked up in it every night.  It\nhad been let into the wall behind one end of the book-case, expressly\nto preserve the barbaric splendor of Mrs. Carruthers; without a doubt\nthese Lochmabens would use it for the same purpose; and in the altered\ncircumstances I had no hesitation in giving Raffles all the information\nhe desired.  I even drew him a rough plan of the ground-floor on the\nback of my menu-card.\n\n\"It was rather clever of you to notice the kind of locks on the inner\ndoors,\" he remarked as he put it in his pocket.  \"I suppose you don't\nremember if it was a Yale on the front door as well?\"\n\n\"It was not,\" I was able to answer quite promptly.  \"I happen to know\nbecause I once had the key when--when we went to a theatre together.\"\n\n\"Thank you, old chap,\" said Raffles sympathetically.  \"That's all I\nshall want from you, Bunny, my boy.  There's no night like to-night!\"\n\nIt was one of his sayings when bent upon his worst.  I looked at him\naghast.  Our cigars were just in blast, yet already he was signalling\nfor his bill.  It was impossible to remonstrate with him until we were\nboth outside in the street.\n\n\"I'm coming with you,\" said I, running my arm through his.\n\n\"Nonsense, Bunny!\"\n\n\"Why is it nonsense?  I know every inch of the ground, and since the\nhouse has changed hands I have no compunction.  Besides, 'I have been\nthere' in the other sense as well: once a thief, you know!  In for a\npenny, in for a pound!\"\n\nIt was ever my mood when the blood was up.  But my old friend failed to\nappreciate the characteristic as he usually did.  We crossed Regent\nStreet in silence.  I had to catch his sleeve to keep a hand in his\ninhospitable arm.\n\n\"I really think you had better stay away,\" said Raffles as we reached\nthe other curb.  \"I've no use for you this time.\"\n\n\"Yet I thought I had been so useful up to now?\"\n\n\"That may be, Bunny, but I tell you frankly I don't want you to-night.\"\n\n\"Yet I know the ground and you don't!  I tell you what,\" said I: \"I'll\ncome just to show you the ropes, and I won't take a pennyweight of the\nswag.\"\n\nSuch was the teasing fashion in which he invariably prevailed upon me;\nit was delightful to note how it caused him to yield in his turn. But\nRaffles had the grace to give in with a laugh, whereas I too often lost\nmy temper with my point.\n\n\"You little rabbit!\" he chuckled.  \"You shall have your share, whether\nyou come or not; but, seriously, don't you think you might remember the\ngirl?\"\n\n\"What's the use?\" I groaned.  \"You agree there is nothing for it but to\ngive her up.  I am glad to say that for myself before I asked you, and\nwrote to tell her so on Sunday.  Now it's Wednesday, and she hasn't\nanswered by line or sign.  It's waiting for one word from her that's\ndriving me mad.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you wrote to Palace Gardens?\"\n\n\"No, I sent it to the country.  There's been time for an answer,\nwherever she may be.\"\n\nWe had reached the Albany, and halted with one accord at the Piccadilly\nportico, red cigar to red cigar.\n\n\"You wouldn't like to go and see if the answer's in your rooms?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"No.  What's the good?  Where's the point in giving her up if I'm going\nto straighten out when it's too late?  It is too late, I have given her\nup, and I am coming with you!\"\n\nThe hand that bowled the most puzzling ball in England (once it found\nits length) descended on my shoulder with surprising promptitude.\n\n\"Very well, Bunny!  That's finished; but your blood be on your own pate\nif evil comes of it.  Meanwhile we can't do better than turn in here\ntill you have finished your cigar as it deserves, and topped up with\nsuch a cup of tea as you must learn to like if you hope to get on in\nyour new profession.  And when the hours are small enough, Bunny, my\nboy, I don't mind admitting I shall be very glad to have you with me.\"\n\nI have a vivid memory of the interim in his rooms.  I think it must\nhave been the first and last of its kind that I was called upon to\nsustain with so much knowledge of what lay before me.  I passed the\ntime with one restless eye upon the clock, and the other on the\nTantalus which Raffles ruthlessly declined to unlock.  He admitted that\nit was like waiting with one's pads on; and in my slender experience of\nthe game of which he was a world's master, that was an ordeal not to be\nendured without a general quaking of the inner man.  I was, on the\nother hand, all right when I got to the metaphorical wicket; and half\nthe surprises that Raffles sprung on me were doubtless due to his early\nrecognition of the fact.\n\nOn this occasion I fell swiftly and hopelessly out of love with the\nprospect I had so gratuitously embraced.  It was not only my repugnance\nto enter that house in that way, which grew upon my better judgment as\nthe artificial enthusiasm of the evening evaporated from my veins.\nStrong as that repugnance became, I had an even stronger feeling that\nwe were embarking on an important enterprise far too much upon the spur\nof the moment.  The latter qualm I had the temerity to confess to\nRaffles; nor have I often loved him more than when he freely admitted\nit to be the most natural feeling in the world.  He assured me,\nhowever, that he had had my Lady Lochmaben and her jewels in his mind\nfor several months; he had sat behind them at first nights; and long\nago determined what to take or to reject; in fine, he had only been\nwaiting for those topographical details which it had been my chance\nprivilege to supply.  I now learned that he had numerous houses in a\nsimilar state upon his list; something or other was wanting in each\ncase in order to complete his plans.  In that of the Bond Street\njeweller it was a trusty accomplice; in the present instance, a more\nintimate knowledge of the house.  And lastly, this was a Wednesday\nnight, when the tired legislator gets early to his bed.\n\nHow I wish I could make the whole world see and hear him, and smell the\nsmoke of his beloved Sullivan, as he took me into these, the secrets of\nhis infamous trade!  Neither look nor language would betray the infamy.\nAs a mere talker, I shall never listen to the like of Raffles on this\nside of the sod; and his talk was seldom garnished by an oath, never in\nmy remembrance by the unclean word. Then he looked like a man who had\ndressed to dine out, not like one who had long since dined; for his\ncurly hair, though longer that another's, was never untidy in its\nlength; and these were the days when it was still as black as ink.  Nor\nwere there many lines as yet upon the smooth and mobile face; and its\nframe was still that dear den of disorder and good taste, with the\ncarved book-case, the dresser and chests of still older oak, and the\nWattses and Rossettis hung anyhow on the walls.\n\nIt must have been one o'clock before we drove in a hansom as far as\nKensington Church, instead of getting down at the gates of our private\nroad to ruin.  Constitutionally shy of the direct approach, Raffles was\nfurther deterred by a ball in full swing at the Empress Rooms, whence\npotential witnesses were pouring between dances into the cool deserted\nstreet.  Instead he led me a little way up Church Street, and so\nthrough the narrow passage into Palace Gardens.  He knew the house as\nwell as I did.  We made our first survey from the other side of the\nroad.  And the house was not quite in darkness; there was a dim light\nover the door, a brighter one in the stables, which stood still farther\nback from the road.\n\n\"That's a bit of a bore,\" said Raffles.  \"The ladies have been out\nsomewhere--trust them to spoil the show!  They would get to bed before\nthe stable folk, but insomnia is the curse of their sex and our\nprofession.  Somebody's not home yet; that will be the son of the\nhouse; but he's a beauty, who may not come home at all.\"\n\n\"Another Alick Carruthers,\" I murmured, recalling the one I liked least\nof all the household, as I remembered it.\n\n\"They might be brothers,\" rejoined Raffles, who knew all the loose fish\nabout town.  \"Well, I'm not sure that I shall want you after all,\nBunny.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"If the front door's only on the latch, and you're right about the\nlock, I shall walk in as though I were the son of the house myself.\"\n\nAnd he jingled the skeleton bunch that he carried on a chain as honest\nmen carry their latchkeys.\n\n\"You forget the inner doors and the safe.\"\n\n\"True.  You might be useful to me there.  But I still don't like\nleading you in where it isn't absolutely necessary, Bunny.\"\n\n\"Then let me lead you, I answered, and forthwith marched across the\nbroad, secluded road, with the great houses standing back on either\nside in their ample gardens, as though the one opposite belonged to me.\nI thought Raffles had stayed behind, for I never heard him at my heels,\nyet there he was when I turned round at the gate.\n\n\"I must teach you the step,\" he whispered, shaking his head.  \"You\nshouldn't use your heel at all.  Here's a grass border for you: walk it\nas you would the plank!  Gravel makes a noise, and flower-beds tell a\ntale.  Wait--I must carry you across this.\"\n\nIt was the sweep of the drive, and in the dim light from above the\ndoor, the soft gravel, ploughed into ridges by the night's wheels,\nthreatened an alarm at every step.  Yet Raffles, with me in his arms,\ncrossed the zone of peril softly as the pard.\n\n\"Shoes in your pocket--that's the beauty of pumps!\" he whispered on the\nstep; his light bunch tinkled faintly; a couple of keys he stooped and\ntried, with the touch of a humane dentist; the third let us into the\nporch.  And as we stood together on the mat, as he was gradually\nclosing the door, a clock within chimed a half-hour in fashion so\nthrillingly familiar to me that I caught Raffles by the arm.  My\nhalf-hours of happiness had flown to just such chimes! I looked wildly\nabout me in the dim light.  Hat-stand and oak settee belonged equally\nto my past.  And Raffles was smiling in my face as he held the door\nwide for my escape.\n\n\"You told me a lie!\" I gasped in whispers.\n\n\"I did nothing of the sort,\" he replied.  \"The furniture's the\nfurniture of Hector Carruthers; but the house is the house of Lord\nLochmaben.  Look here!\"\n\nHe had stooped, and was smoothing out the discarded envelope of a\ntelegram.  \"Lord Lochmaben,\" I read in pencil by the dim light; and the\ncase was plain to me on the spot.  My friends had let their house,\nfurnished, as anybody but Raffles would have explained to me in the\nbeginning.\n\n\"All right,\" I said.  \"Shut the door.\"\n\nAnd he not only shut it without a sound, but drew a bolt that might\nhave been sheathed in rubber.\n\nIn another minute we were at work upon the study-door, I with the tiny\nlantern and the bottle of rock-oil, he with the brace and the largest\nbit.  The Yale lock he had given up at a glance.  It was placed high up\nin the door, feet above the handle, and the chain of holes with which\nRaffles had soon surrounded it were bored on a level with his eyes.\nYet the clock in the hall chimed again, and two ringing strokes\nresounded through the silent house before we gained admittance to the\nroom.\n\nRaffle's next care was to muffle the bell on the shuttered window (with\na silk handkerchief from the hat-stand) and to prepare an emergency\nexit by opening first the shutters and then the window itself.  Luckily\nit was a still night, and very little wind came in to embarrass us.  He\nthen began operations on the safe, revealed by me behind its folding\nscreen of books, while I stood sentry on the threshold.  I may have\nstood there for a dozen minutes, listening to the loud hall clock and\nto the gentle dentistry of Raffles in the mouth of the safe behind me,\nwhen a third sound thrilled my every nerve.  It was the equally\ncautious opening of a door in the gallery overhead.\n\nI moistened my lips to whisper a word of warning to Raffles.  But his\nears had been as quick as mine, and something longer.  His lantern\ndarkened as I turned my head; next moment I felt his breath upon the\nback of my neck.  It was now too late even for a whisper, and quite out\nof the question to close the mutilated door.  There we could only\nstand, I on the threshold, Raffles at my elbow, while one carrying a\ncandle crept down the stairs.\n\nThe study-door was at right angles to the lowest flight, and just to\nthe right of one alighting in the hall.  It was thus impossible for us\nto see who it was until the person was close abreast of us; but by the\nrustle of the gown we knew that it was one of the ladies, and dressed\njust as she had come from theatre or ball.  Insensibly I drew back as\nthe candle swam into our field of vision: it had not traversed many\ninches when a hand was clapped firmly but silently across my mouth.\n\nI could forgive Raffles for that, at any rate!  In another breath I\nshould have cried aloud: for the girl with the candle, the girl in her\nball-dress, at dead of night, the girl with the letter for the post,\nwas the last girl on God's wide earth whom I should have chosen thus to\nencounter--a midnight intruder in the very house where I had been\nreluctantly received on her account!\n\nI forgot Raffles.  I forgot the new and unforgivable grudge I had\nagainst him now.  I forgot his very hand across my mouth, even before\nhe paid me the compliment of removing it.  There was the only girl in\nall the world: I had eyes and brains for no one and for nothing else.\nShe had neither seen nor heard us, had looked neither to the right hand\nnor the left.  But a small oak table stood on the opposite side of the\nhall; it was to this table that she went.  On it was one of those boxes\nin which one puts one's letters for the post; and she stooped to read\nby her candle the times at which this box was cleared.\n\nThe loud clock ticked and ticked.  She was standing at her full height\nnow, her candle on the table, her letter in both hands, and in her\ndowncast face a sweet and pitiful perplexity that drew the tears to my\neyes.  Through a film I saw her open the envelope so lately sealed and\nread her letter once more, as though she would have altered it a little\nat the last.  It was too late for that; but of a sudden she plucked a\nrose from her bosom, and was pressing it in with her letter when I\ngroaned aloud.\n\nHow could I help it?  The letter was for me: of that I was as sure as\nthough I had been looking over her shoulder.  She was as true as\ntempered steel; there were not two of us to whom she wrote and sent\nroses at dead of night.  It was her one chance of writing to me. None\nwould know that she had written.  And she cared enough to soften the\nreproaches I had richly earned, with a red rose warm from her own warm\nheart.  And there, and there was I, a common thief who had broken in to\nsteal!  Yet I was unaware that I had uttered a sound until she looked\nup, startled, and the hands behind me pinned me where I stood.\n\nI think she must have seen us, even in the dim light of the solitary\ncandle.  Yet not a sound escaped her as she peered courageously in our\ndirection; neither did one of us move; but the hall clock went on and\non, every tick like the beat of a drum to bring the house about our\nears, until a minute must have passed as in some breathless dream.  And\nthen came the awakening--with such a knocking and a ringing at the\nfront door as brought all three of us to our senses on the spot.\n\n\"The son of the house!\" whispered Raffles in my ear, as he dragged me\nback to the window he had left open for our escape.  But as he leaped\nout first a sharp cry stopped me at the sill.  \"Get back! Get back!\nWe're trapped!\" he cried; and in the single second that I stood there,\nI saw him fell one officer to the ground, and dart across the lawn with\nanother at his heels.  A third came running up to the window.  What\ncould I do but double back into the house?  And there in the hall I met\nmy lost love face to face.\n\nTill that moment she had not recognized me.  I ran to catch her as she\nall but fell.  And my touch repelled her into life, so that she shook\nme off, and stood gasping: \"You, of all men!  You, of all men!\" until I\ncould bear it no more, but broke again for the study-window. \"Not that\nway--not that way!\" she cried in an agony at that.  Her hands were upon\nme now.  \"In there, in there,\" she whispered, pointing and pulling me\nto a mere cupboard under the stairs, where hats and coats were hung;\nand it was she who shut the door on me with a sob.\n\nDoors were already opening overhead, voices calling, voices answering,\nthe alarm running like wildfire from room to room.  Soft feet pattered\nin the gallery and down the stairs about my very ears. I do not know\nwhat made me put on my own shoes as I heard them, but I think that I\nwas ready and even longing to walk out and give myself up.  I need not\nsay what and who it was that alone restrained me.  I heard her name.  I\nheard them crying to her as though she had fainted.  I recognized the\ndetested voice of my bete noir, Alick Carruthers, thick as might be\nexpected of the dissipated dog, yet daring to stutter out her name.\nAnd then I heard, without catching, her low reply; it was in answer to\nthe somewhat stern questioning of quite another voice; and from what\nfollowed I knew that she had never fainted at all.\n\n\"Upstairs, miss, did he?  Are you sure?\"\n\nI did not hear her answer.  I conceive her as simply pointing up the\nstairs.  In any case, about my very ears once more, there now followed\nsuch a patter and tramp of bare and booted feet as renewed in me a base\nfear for my own skin.  But voices and feet passed over my head, went up\nand up, higher and higher; and I was wondering whether or not to make a\ndash for it, when one light pair came running down again, and in very\ndespair I marched out to meet my preserver, looking as little as I\ncould like the abject thing I felt.\n\n\"Be quick!\" she cried in a harsh whisper, and pointed peremptorily to\nthe porch.\n\nBut I stood stubbornly before her, my heart hardened by her hardness,\nand perversely indifferent to all else.  And as I stood I saw the\nletter she had written, in the hand with which she pointed, crushed\ninto a ball.\n\n\"Quickly!\" She stamped her foot.  \"Quickly--if you ever cared!\"\n\nThis in a whisper, without bitterness, without contempt, but with a\nsudden wild entreaty that breathed upon the dying embers of my poor\nmanhood.  I drew myself together for the last time in her sight.  I\nturned, and left her as she wished--for her sake, not for mine.  And as\nI went I heard her tearing her letter into little pieces, and the\nlittle pieces falling on the floor.\n\nThen I remembered Raffles, and could have killed him for what he had\ndone.  Doubtless by this time he was safe and snug in the Albany: what\ndid my fate matter to him?  Never mind; this should be the end between\nhim and me as well; it was the end of everything, this dark night's\nwork!  I would go and tell him so.  I would jump into a cab and drive\nthere and then to his accursed rooms.  But first I must escape from the\ntrap in which he had been so ready to leave me.  And on the very steps\nI drew back in despair.  They were searching the shrubberies between\nthe drive and the road; a policeman's lantern kept flashing in and out\namong the laurels, while a young man in evening-clothes directed him\nfrom the gravel sweep.  It was this young man whom I must dodge, but at\nmy first step in the gravel he wheeled round, and it was Raffles\nhimself.\n\n\"Hulloa!\" he cried.  \"So you've come up to join the dance as well! Had\na look inside, have you?  You'll be better employed in helping to draw\nthe cover in front here.  It's all right, officer--only another\ngentleman from the Empress Rooms.\"\n\nAnd we made a brave show of assisting in the futile search, until the\narrival of more police, and a broad hint from an irritable sergeant,\ngave us an excellent excuse for going off arm-in-arm. But it was\nRaffles who had thrust his arm through mine.  I shook him off as we\nleft the scene of shame behind.\n\n\"My dear Bunny!\" he exclaimed.  \"Do you know what brought me back?\"\n\nI answered savagely that I neither knew nor cared.\n\n\"I had the very devil of a squeak for it,\" he went on.  \"I did the\nhurdles over two or three garden-walls, but so did the flyer who was on\nmy tracks, and he drove me back into the straight and down to High\nStreet like any lamplighter.  If he had only had the breath to sing out\nit would have been all up with me then; as it was I pulled off my coat\nthe moment I was round the corner, and took a ticket for it at the\nEmpress Rooms.\"\n\n\"I suppose you had one for the dance that was going on,\" I growled. Nor\nwould it have been a coincidence for Raffles to have had a ticket for\nthat or any other entertainment of the London season.\n\n\"I never asked what the dance was,\" he returned.  \"I merely took the\nopportunity of revising my toilet, and getting rid of that rather\ndistinctive overcoat, which I shall call for now.  They're not too\nparticular at such stages of such proceedings, but I've no doubt I\nshould have seen someone I knew if I had none right in.  I might even\nhave had a turn, if only I had been less uneasy about you, Bunny.\"\n\n\"It was like you to come back to help me out,\" said I.  \"But to lie to\nme, and to inveigle me with your lies into that house of all\nhouses--that was not like you, Raffles--and I never shall forgive it or\nyou!\"\n\nRaffles took my arm again.  We were near the High Street gates of\nPalace Gardens, and I was too miserable to resist an advance which I\nmeant never to give him an opportunity to repeat.\n\n\"Come, come, Bunny, there wasn't much inveigling about it,\" said he. \"I\ndid my level best to leave you behind, but you wouldn't listen to me.\"\n\n\"If you had told me the truth I should have listened fast enough,\" I\nretorted.  \"But what's the use of talking?  You can boast of your own\nadventures after you bolted.  You don't care what happened to me.\"\n\n\"I cared so much that I came back to see.\"\n\n\"You might have spared yourself the trouble!  The wrong had been done.\nRaffles--Raffles--don't you know who she was?\"\n\nIt was my hand that gripped his arm once more.\n\n\"I guessed,\" he answered, gravely enough even for me.\n\n\"It was she who saved me, not you,\" I said.  \"And that is the bitterest\npart of all!\"\n\nYet I told him that part with a strange sad pride in her whom I had\nlost--through him--forever.  As I ended we turned into High Street; in\nthe prevailing stillness, the faint strains of the band reached us from\nthe Empress Rooms; and I hailed a crawling hansom as Raffles turned\nthat way.\n\n\"Bunny,\" said he, \"it's no use saying I'm sorry.  Sorrow adds insult in\na case like this--if ever there was or will be such another! Only\nbelieve me, Bunny, when I swear to you that I had not the smallest\nshadow of a suspicion that she was in the house.\"\n\nAnd in my heart of hearts I did believe him; but I could not bring\nmyself to say the words.\n\n\"You told me yourself that you had written to her in the country,\" he\npursued.\n\n\"And that letter!\" I rejoined, in a fresh wave of bitterness: \"that\nletter she had written at dead of night, and stolen down to post, it\nwas the one I have been waiting for all these days!  I should have got\nit to-morrow.  Now I shall never get it, never hear from her again, nor\nhave another chance in this world or in the next. I don't say it was\nall your fault.  You no more knew that she was there than I did.  But\nyou told me a deliberate lie about her people, and that I never shall\nforgive.\"\n\nI spoke as vehemently as I could under my breath.  The hansom was\nwaiting at the curb.\n\n\"I can say no more than I have said,\" returned Raffles with a shrug.\n\"Lie or no lie, I didn't tell it to bring you with me, but to get you\nto give me certain information without feeling a beast about it. But,\nas a matter of fact, it was no lie about old Hector Carruthers and Lord\nLochmaben, and anybody but you would have guessed the truth.\"\n\n\"'What is the truth?\"\n\n\"I as good as told you, Bunny, again and again.\"\n\n\"Then tell me now.\"\n\n\"If you read your paper there would be no need; but if you want to\nknow, old Carruthers headed the list of the Birthday Honors, and Lord\nLochmaben is the title of his choice.\"\n\nAnd this miserable quibble was not a lie!  My lip curled, I turned my\nback without a word, and drove home to my Mount Street flat in a new\nfury of savage scorn.  Not a lie, indeed!  It was the one that is half\na truth, the meanest lie of all, and the very last to which I could\nhave dreamt that Raffles would stoop.  So far there had been a degree\nof honor between us, if only of the kind understood to obtain between\nthief and thief.  Now all that was at an end. Raffles had cheated me.\nRaffles had completed the ruin of my life. I was done with Raffles, as\nshe who shall not be named was done with me.\n\nAnd yet, even while I blamed him most bitterly, and utterly abominated\nhis deceitful deed, I could not but admit in my heart that the result\nwas put of all proportion to the intent: he had never dreamt of doing\nme this injury, or indeed any injury at all. Intrinsically the deceit\nhad been quite venial, the reason for it obviously the reason that\nRaffles had given me.  It was quite true that he had spoken of this\nLochmaben peerage as a new creation, and of the heir to it in a fashion\nonly applicable to Alick Carruthers.  He had given me hints, which I\nhad been too dense to take, and he had certainly made more than one\nattempt to deter me from accompanying him on this fatal emprise; had he\nbeen more explicit, I might have made it my business to deter him.  I\ncould not say in my heart that Raffles had failed to satisfy such honor\nas I might reasonably expect to subsist between us.  Yet it seems to me\nto require a superhuman sanity always and unerringly to separate cause\nfrom effect, achievement from intent.  And I, for one, was never quite\nable to do so in this case.\n\nI could not be accused of neglecting my newspaper during the next few\nwretched days.  I read every word that I could find about the attempted\njewel-robbery in Palace Gardens, and the reports afforded me my sole\ncomfort.  In the first place, it was only an attempted robbery; nothing\nhad been taken, after all.  And then--and then--the one member of the\nhousehold who had come nearest to a personal encounter with either of\nus was unable to furnish any description of the man--had even expressed\na doubt as to the likelihood of identification in the event of an\narrest!\n\nI will not say with what mingled feelings I read and dwelt on that\nannouncement It kept a certain faint glow alive within me until the\nmorning brought me back the only presents I had ever made her.  They\nwere books; jewellery had been tabooed by the authorities.  And the\nbooks came back without a word, though the parcel was directed in her\nhand.\n\nI had made up my mind not to go near Raffles again, but in my heart I\nalready regretted my resolve.  I had forfeited love, I had sacrificed\nhonor, and now I must deliberately alienate myself from the one being\nwhose society might yet be some recompense for all that I had lost.\nThe situation was aggravated by the state of my exchequer.  I expected\nan ultimatum from my banker by every post. Yet this influence was\nnothing to the other.  It was Raffles I loved. It was not the dark life\nwe led together, still less its base rewards; it was the man himself,\nhis gayety, his humor, his dazzling audacity, his incomparable courage\nand resource.  And a very horror of turning to him again in mere need\nof greed set the seal on my first angry resolution.  But the anger was\nsoon gone out of me, and when at length Raffles bridged the gap by\ncoming to me, I rose to greet him almost with a shout.\n\nHe came as though nothing had happened; and, indeed, not very many days\nhad passed, though they might have been months to me.  Yet I fancied\nthe gaze that watched me through our smoke a trifle less sunny than it\nhad been before.  And it was a relief to me when he came with few\npreliminaries to the inevitable point.\n\n\"Did you ever hear from her, Bunny?\" he asked.\n\n\"In a way,\" I answered.  \"We won't talk about it, if you don't mind,\nRaffles.\"\n\n\"That sort of way!\" he exclaimed.  He seemed both surprised and\ndisappointed.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"that sort of way.  It's finished.  What did you expect?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Raffles.  \"I only thought that the girl who went\nso far to get a fellow out of a tight place might go a little farther\nto keep him from getting into another.\"\n\n\"I don't see why she should,\" said I, honestly enough, yet with the\nirritation of a less just feeling deep down in my inmost consciousness.\n\n\"Yet you did hear from her?\" he persisted.\n\n\"She sent me back my poor presents, without a word,\" I said, \"if you\ncall that hearing.\"\n\nI could not bring myself to own to Raffles that I had given her only\nbooks.  He asked if I was sure that she had sent them back herself; and\nthat was his last question.  My answer was enough for him.  And to this\nday I cannot say whether it was more in relief than in regret that he\nlaid a hand upon my shoulder.\n\n\"So you are out of Paradise after all!\" said Raffles.  \"I was not sure,\nor I should have come round before.  Well, Bunny, if they don't want\nyou there, there's a little Inferno in the Albany where you will be as\nwelcome as ever.\"\n\nAnd still, with all the magic mischief of his smile, there was that\ntouch of sadness which I was yet to read aright.\n\n\n\n\nThe Chest of Silver\n\nLike all the tribe of which I held him head, Raffles professed the\nliveliest disdain for unwieldy plunder of any description; it might be\nold Sheffield, or it might be solid silver or gold, but if the thing\nwas not to be concealed about the person, he would none whatever of it.\nUnlike the rest of us, however, in this as in all else, Raffles would\nnot infrequently allow the acquisitive spirit of the mere collector to\nsilence the dictates of professional prudence.  The old oak chests, and\neven the mahogany wine-cooler, for which he had doubtless paid like an\nhonest citizen, were thus immovable with pieces of crested plate, which\nhe had neither the temerity to use nor the hardihood to melt or sell.\nHe could but gloat over them behind locked doors, as I used to tell\nhim, and at last one afternoon I caught him at it.  It was in the year\nafter that of my novitiate, a halcyon period at the Albany, when\nRaffles left no crib uncracked, and I played second-murderer every\ntime. I had called in response to a telegram in which he stated that he\nwas going out of town, and must say good-by to me before he went. And I\ncould only think that he was inspired by the same impulse toward the\nbronzed salvers and the tarnished teapots with which I found him\nsurrounded, until my eyes lit upon the enormous silver-chest into which\nhe was fitting them one by one.\n\n\"Allow me, Bunny!  I shall take the liberty of locking both doors\nbehind you and putting the key in my pocket,\" said Raffles, when he had\nlet me in.  \"Not that I mean to take you prisoner, my dear fellow; but\nthere are those of us who can turn keys from the outside, though it was\nnever an accomplishment of mine.\"\n\n\"Not Crawshay again?\" I cried, standing still in my hat.\n\nRaffles regarded me with that tantalizing smile of his which might mean\nnothing, yet which often meant so much; and in a flash I was convinced\nthat our most jealous enemy and dangerous rival, the doyen of an older\nschool, had paid him yet another visit.\n\n\"That remains to be seen,\" was the measured reply; \"and I for one have\nnot set naked eye on the fellow since I saw him off through that window\nand left myself for dead on this very spot.  In fact, I imagined him\ncomfortably back in jail.\"\n\n\"Not old Crawshay!\" said I.  \"He's far too good a man to be taken\ntwice.  I should call him the very prince of professional cracksmen.\"\n\n\"Should you?\" said Raffles coldly, with as cold an eye looking into\nmine.  \"Then you had better prepare to repel princes when I'm gone.\"\n\n\"But gone where?\" I asked, finding a corner for my hat and coat, and\nhelping myself to the comforts of the venerable dresser which was one\nof our friend's greatest treasures.  \"Where is it you are off to, and\nwhy are you taking this herd of white elephants with you?\"\n\nRaffles bestowed the cachet of his smile on my description of his\nmotley plate.  He joined me in one of his favorite cigarettes, only\nshaking a superior head at his own decanter.\n\n\"One question at a time, Bunny,\" said he.  \"In the first place, I am\ngoing to have these rooms freshened up with a potful of paint, the\nelectric light, and the telephone you've been at me about so long.\"\n\n\"Good!\" I cried.  \"Then we shall be able to talk to each other day and\nnight!\"\n\n\"And get overheard and run in for our pains?  I shall wait till you are\nrun in, I think,\" said Raffles cruelly.  \"But the rest's a necessity:\nnot that I love new paint or am pining for electric light, but for\nreasons which I will just breathe in your private ear, Bunny. You must\nnot try to take them too seriously; but the fact is, there is just the\nleast bit of a twitter against me in this rookery of an Albany.  It\nmust have been started by that tame old bird, Policeman Mackenzie; it\nisn't very bad as yet, but it needn't be that to reach my ears.  Well,\nit was open to me either to clear out altogether, and so confirm\nwhatever happened to be in the air, or to go off for a time, under some\narrangement which would give the authorities ample excuse for\noverhauling every inch of my rooms.  Which would you have done, Bunny?\"\n\n\"Cleared out, while I could!\" said I devoutly.\n\n\"So I should have thought,\" rejoined Raffles.  \"Yet you see the merit\nof my plan.  I shall leave every mortal thing unlocked.\"\n\n\"Except that,\" said I, kicking the huge oak case with the iron bands\nand clamps, and the baize lining fast disappearing under heavy packages\nbearing the shapes of urns and candelabra.\n\n\"That,\" replied Raffles, \"is neither to go with me nor to remain here.\"\n\n\"Then what do you propose to do with it?\"\n\n\"You have your banking account, and your banker,\" he went on.  This was\nperfectly true, though it was Raffles alone who had kept the one open,\nand enabled me to propitiate the other in moments of emergency.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, pay in this bundle of notes this afternoon, and say you have had\na great week at Liverpool and Lincoln; then ask them if they can do\nwith your silver while you run over to Paris for a merry Easter.  I\nshould tell them it's rather heavy--a lot of old family stuff that\nyou've a good mind to leave with them till you marry and settle down.\"\n\nI winced at this, but consented to the rest after a moment's\nconsideration.  After all, and for more reasons that I need enumerate,\nit was a plausible tale enough.  And Raffles had no banker; it was\nquite impossible for him to explain, across any single counter, the\nlarge sums of hard cash which did sometimes fall into his hands; and it\nmight well be that he had nursed my small account in view of the very\nquandary which had now arisen.  On all grounds, it was impossible for\nme to refuse him, and I am still glad to remember that my assent was\ngiven, on the whole, ungrudgingly.\n\n\"But when will the chest be ready for me,\" I merely asked, as I stuffed\nthe notes into my cigarette case.  \"And how are we to get it out of\nthis, in banking hours, without attracting any amount of attention at\nthis end?\"\n\nRaffles gave me an approving nod.\n\n\"I'm glad to see you spot the crux so quickly, Bunny.  I have thought\nof your taking it round to your place first, under cloud of night; but\nwe are bound to be seen even so, and on the whole it would look far\nless suspicious in broad daylight.  It will take you some twelve or\nfifteen minutes to drive to your bank in a growler, so if you are here\nwith one at a quarter to ten to-morrow morning, that will exactly meet\nthe case.  But you must have a hansom this minute if you mean to\nprepare the way with those notes this afternoon!\"\n\nIt was only too like the Raffles of those days to dismiss a subject and\nmyself in the same breath, with a sudden nod, and a brief grasp of the\nhand he was already holding out for mine.  I had a great mind to take\nanother of his cigarettes instead, for there were one or two points on\nwhich he had carefully omitted to enlighten me.  Thus, I had still to\nlearn the bare direction of his journey; and it was all that I could do\nto drag it from him as I stood buttoning my coat and gloves.\n\n\"Scotland,\" he vouchsafed at last.\n\n\"At Easter,\" I remarked.\n\n\"To learn the language,\" he explained.  \"I have no tongue but my own,\nyou see, but I try to make up for it by cultivating every shade of\nthat.  Some of them have come in useful even to your knowledge, Bunny:\nwhat price my Cockney that night in St.  John's Wood?  I can keep up my\nend in stage Irish, real Devonshire, very fair Norfolk, and three\ndistinct Yorkshire dialects.  But my good Galloway Scots might be\nbetter, and I mean to make it so.\"\n\n\"You still haven't told me where to write to you.\"\n\n\"I'll write to you first, Bunny.\"\n\n\"At least let me see you off,\" I urged at the door.  \"I promise not to\nlook at your ticket if you tell me the train!\"\n\n\"The eleven-fifty from Euston.\"\n\n\"Then I'll be with you by quarter to ten.\"\n\nAnd I left him without further parley, reading his impatience in his\nface.  Everything, to be sure, seemed clear enough without that fuller\ndiscussion which I loved and Raffles hated.  Yet I thought we might at\nleast have dined together, and in my heart I felt just the least bit\nhurt, until it occurred to me as I drove to count the notes in my\ncigarette case.  Resentment was impossible after that. The sum ran well\ninto three figures, and it was plain that Raffles meant me to have a\ngood time in his absence.  So I told his lie with unction at my bank,\nand made due arrangements for the reception of his chest next morning.\nThen I repaired to our club, hoping he would drop in, and that we might\ndine together after all.  In that I was disappointed.  It was nothing,\nhowever, to the disappointment awaiting me at the Albany, when I\narrived in my four-wheeler at the appointed hour next morning.\n\n\"Mr. Raffles 'as gawn, sir,\" said the porter, with a note of reproach\nin his confidential undertone.  The man was a favorite with Raffles,\nwho used him and tipped him with consummate tact, and he knew me only\nless well.\n\n\"Gone!\" I echoed aghast.  \"Where on earth to?\"\n\n\"Scotland, sir.\"\n\n\"Already?\"\n\n\"By the eleven-fifty lawst night.\"\n\n\"Last night!  I thought he meant eleven-fifty this morning!\"\n\n\"He knew you did, sir, when you never came, and he told me to tell you\nthere was no such train.\"\n\nI could have rent my garments in mortification and annoyance with\nmyself and Raffles.  It was as much his fault as mine.  But for his\nindecent haste in getting rid of me, his characteristic abruptness at\nthe end, there would have been no misunderstanding or mistake.\n\n\"Any other message?\" I inquired morosely.\n\n\"Only about the box, sir.  Mr. Raffles said as you was goin' to take\nchawge of it time he's away, and I've a friend ready to lend a 'and in\ngetting it on the cab.  It's a rare 'eavy 'un, but Mr. Raffles an' me\ncould lift it all right between us, so I dessay me an' my friend can.\"\n\nFor my own part, I must confess that its weight concerned me less than\nthe vast size of that infernal chest, as I drove with it past club and\npark at ten o'clock in the morning.  Sit as far back as I might in the\nfour-wheeler, I could conceal neither myself nor my connection with the\nhuge iron-clamped case upon the roof: in my heated imagination its wood\nwas glass through which all the world could see the guilty contents.\nOnce an officious constable held up the traffic at our approach, and\nfor a moment I put a blood-curdling construction upon the simple\nceremony.  Low boys shouted after us--or if it was not after us, I\nthought it was--and that their cry was \"Stop thief!\"  Enough said of\none of the most unpleasant cab-drives I ever had in my life.  Horresco\nreferens.\n\nAt the bank, however, thanks to the foresight and liberality of\nRaffles, all was smooth water.  I paid my cabman handsomely, gave a\nflorin to the stout fellow in livery whom he helped with the chest, and\ncould have pressed gold upon the genial clerk who laughed like a\ngentleman at my jokes about the Liverpool winners and the latest\nbetting on the Family Plate.  I was only disconcerted when he informed\nme that the bank gave no receipts for deposits of this nature.  I am\nnow aware that few London banks do.  But it is pleasing to believe that\nat the time I looked--what I felt--as though all I valued upon earth\nwere in jeopardy.\n\nI should have got through the rest of that day happily enough, such was\nthe load off my mind and hands, but for an extraordinary and most\ndisconcerting note received late at night from Raffles himself. He was\na man who telegraphed freely, but seldom wrote a letter. Sometimes,\nhowever, he sent a scribbled line by special messenger; and overnight,\nevidently in the train, he had scribbled this one to post in the small\nhours at Crewe:\n\n  \"'Ware Prince of Professors!  He was in the offing when I left.\n  If slightest cause for uneasiness about bank, withdraw at once\n  and keep in own rooms Like good chap,\n\n                                                    \"A. J. R.\n\n  \"P. S.--Other reasons, as you shall hear.\"\n\n\nThere was a nice nightcap for a puzzled head!  I had made rather an\nevening of it, what with increase of funds and decrease of anxiety, but\nthis cryptic admonition spoiled the remainder of my night.  It had\narrived by a late post, and I only wished that I had left it all night\nin my letter-box.  What exactly did it mean?  And what exactly must I\ndo?  These were questions that confronted me with fresh force in the\nmorning.\n\nThe news of Crawshay did not surprise me.  I was quite sure that\nRaffles had been given good reason to bear him in mind before his\njourney, even if he had not again beheld the ruffian in the flesh. That\nruffian and that journey might be more intimately connected than I had\nyet supposed.  Raffles never told me all.  Yet the solid fact held\ngood--held better than ever--that I had seen his plunder safely planted\nin my bank.  Crawshay himself could not follow it there.  I was certain\nhe had not followed my cab: in the acute self-consciousness induced by\nthat abominable drive, I should have known it in my bones if he had.  I\nthought of the porter's friend who had helped me with the chest.  No, I\nremember him as well as I remembered Crawshay; they were quite\ndifferent types.\n\nTo remove that vile box from the bank, on top of another cab, with no\nstronger pretext and no further instructions, was not to be thought of\nfor a moment.  Yet I did think of it, for hours.  I was always anxious\nto do my part by Raffles; he had done more than his by me, not once or\ntwice, to-day or yesterday, but again and again from the very first.  I\nneed not state the obvious reasons I had for fighting shy of the\npersonal custody of his accursed chest. Yet he had run worse risks for\nme, and I wanted him to learn that he, too, could depend on a devotion\nnot unworthy of his own.\n\nIn my dilemma I did what I have often done when at a loss for light and\nleading.  I took hardly any lunch, but went to Northumberland Avenue\nand had a Turkish bath instead.  I know nothing so cleansing to mind as\nwell as body, nothing better calculated to put the finest possible edge\non such judgment as one may happen to possess.  Even Raffles, without\nan ounce to lose or a nerve to soothe, used to own a sensuous\nappreciation of the peace of mind and person to be gained in this\nfashion when all others failed.  For me, the fun began before the boots\nwere off one's feet; the muffled footfalls, the thin sound of the\nfountain, even the spent swathed forms upon the couches, and the whole\nclean, warm, idle atmosphere, were so much unction to my simpler soul.\nThe half-hour in the hot-rooms I used to count but a strenuous step to\na divine lassitude of limb and accompanying exaltation of intellect.\nAnd yet--and yet--it was in the hottest room of all, in a temperature\nof 270 deg. Fahrenheit, that the bolt fell from the Pall Mall Gazette\nwhich I had bought outside the bath.\n\nI was turning over the hot, crisp pages, and positively revelling in my\nfiery furnace, when the following headlines and leaded paragraphs leapt\nto my eye with the force of a veritable blow:\n\n                    BANK ROBBERS IN THE WEST END--\n                    DARING AND MYSTERIOUS CRIME\n\n  An audacious burglary and dastardly assault have been committed\n  on the premises of the City and Suburban Bank in Sloane Street, W.\n  From the details so far to hand, the robbery appears to have been\n  deliberately planned and adroitly executed in the early hours of\n  this morning.\n\n  A night watchman named Fawcett states that between one and two\n  o'clock he heard a slight noise in the neighborhood of the lower\n  strong-room, used as a repository for the plate and other\n  possessions of various customers of the bank.  Going down to\n  investigate, he was instantly attacked by a powerful ruffian,\n  who succeeded in felling him to the ground before an alarm could\n  be raised.\n\n  Fawcett is unable to furnish any description of his assailant\n  or assailants, but is of opinion that more than one were engaged\n  in the commission of the crime.  When the unfortunate man\n  recovered consciousness, no trace of the thieves remained, with\n  the exception of a single candle which had been left burning on\n  the flags of the corridor.  The strong-room, however, had been\n  opened, and it is feared the raid on the chests of plate and\n  other valuables may prove to have been only too successful, in\n  view of the Easter exodus, which the thieves had evidently taken\n  into account.  The ordinary banking chambers were not even\n  visited; entry and exit are believed to have been effected\n  through the coal cellar, which is also situated in the basement.\n  Up to the present the police have effected no arrest.\n\nI sat practically paralyzed by this appalling news; and I swear that,\neven in that incredible temperature, it was a cold perspiration in\nwhich I sweltered from head to heel.  Crawshay, of course!  Crawshay\nonce more upon the track of Raffles and his ill-gotten gains!  And once\nmore I blamed Raffles himself: his warning had come too late: he should\nhave wired to me at once not to take the box to the bank at all.  He\nwas a madman ever to have invested in so obvious and obtrusive a\nreceptacle for treasure.  It would serve Raffles right if that and no\nother was the box which had been broken into by the thieves.\n\nYet, when I considered the character of his treasure, I fairly\nshuddered in my sweat.  It was a hoard of criminal relics.  Suppose his\nchest had indeed been rifled, and emptied of every silver thing but\none; that one remaining piece of silver, seen of men, was quite enough\nto cast Raffles into the outer darkness of penal servitude! And\nCrawshay was capable of it--of perceiving the insidious revenge--of\ntaking it without compunction or remorse.\n\nThere was only one course for me.  I must follow my instructions to the\nletter and recover the chest at all hazards, or be taken myself in the\nattempt.  If only Raffles had left me some address, to which I could\nhave wired some word of warning!  But it was no use thinking of that;\nfor the rest there was time enough up to four o'clock, and as yet it\nwas not three.  I determined to go through with my bath and make the\nmost of it.  Might it not be my last for years?\n\nBut I was past enjoying even a Turkish bath.  I had not the patience\nfor a proper shampoo, or sufficient spirit for the plunge.  I weighed\nmyself automatically, for that was a matter near my heart; but I forgot\nto give my man his sixpence until the reproachful intonation of his\nadieu recalled me to myself.  And my couch in the cooling gallery--my\nfavorite couch, in my favorite corner, which I had secured with gusto\non coming in--it was a bed of thorns, with hideous visions of a\nplank-bed to follow!\n\nI ought to be able to add that I heard the burglary discussed on\nadjacent couches before I left I certainly listened for it, and was\nrather disappointed more than once when I had held my breath in vain.\nBut this is the unvarnished record of an odious hour, and it passed\nwithout further aggravation from without; only, as I drove to Sloane\nStreet, the news was on all the posters, and on one I read of \"a clew\"\nwhich spelt for me a doom I was grimly resolved to share.\n\nAlready there was something in the nature of a \"run\" up on the Sloane\nStreet branch of the City and Suburban.  A cab drove away with a chest\nof reasonable dimensions as mine drove up, while in the bank itself a\nlady was making a painful scene.  As for the genial clerk who had\nroared at my jokes the day before, he was mercifully in no mood for any\nmore, but, on the contrary, quite rude to me at sight.\n\n\"I've been expecting you all the afternoon,\" said he.  \"You needn't\nlook so pale.\"\n\n\"Is it safe?\"\n\n\"That Noah's Ark of yours?  Yes, so I hear; they'd just got to it when\nthey were interrupted, and they never went back again.\"\n\n\"Then it wasn't even opened?\"\n\n\"Only just begun on, I believe.\"\n\n\"Thank God!\"\n\n\"You may; we don't,\" growled the clerk.  \"The manager says he believes\nyour chest was at the bottom of it all.\"\n\n\"How could it be?\" I asked uneasily.\n\n\"By being seen on the cab a mile off, and followed,\" said the clerk.\n\n\"Does the manager want to see me?\" I asked boldly.\n\n\"Not unless you want to see him,\" was the blunt reply.  \"He's been at\nit with others all the afternoon, and they haven't all got off as cheap\nas you.\"\n\n\"Then my silver shall not embarrass you any longer,\" said I grandly. \"I\nmeant to leave it if it was all right, but after all you have said I\ncertainly shall not.  Let your man or men bring up the chest at once.\nI dare say they also have been 'at it with others all the afternoon,'\nbut I shall make this worth their while.\"\n\nI did not mind driving through the streets with the thing this time. My\npresent relief was too overwhelming as yet to admit of pangs and fears\nfor the immediate future.  No summer sun had ever shone more brightly\nthan that rather watery one of early April.  There was a green-and-gold\ndust of buds and shoots on the trees as we passed the park.  I felt\ngreater things sprouting in my heart.  Hansoms passed with schoolboys\njust home for the Easter holidays, four-wheelers outward bound, with\nbicycles and perambulators atop; none that rode in them were half so\nhappy as I, with the great load on my cab, but the greater one off my\nheart.\n\nAt Mount Street it just went into the lift; that was a stroke of luck;\nand the lift-man and I between us carried it into my flat. It seemed a\nfeatherweight to me now.  I felt a Samson in the exaltation of that\nhour.  And I will not say what my first act was when I found myself\nalone with my white elephant in the middle of the room; enough that the\nsiphon was still doing its work when the glass slipped through my\nfingers to the floor.\n\n\"Bunny!\"\n\nIt was Raffles.  Yet for a moment I looked about me quite in vain. He\nwas not at the window; he was not at the open door.  And yet Raffles it\nhad been, or at all events his voice, and that bubbling over with fun\nand satisfaction, be his body where it might.  In the end I dropped my\neyes, and there was his living face in the middle of the lid of the\nchest, like that of the saint upon its charger.\n\nBut Raffles was alive, Raffles was laughing as though his vocal cords\nwould snap--there was neither tragedy nor illusion in the apparition of\nRaffles.  A life-size Jack-in-the-box, he had thrust his head through a\nlid within the lid, cut by himself between the two iron bands that ran\nround the chest like the straps of a portmanteau.  He must have been\nbusy at it when I found him pretending to pack, if not far into that\nnight, for it was a very perfect piece of work; and even as I stared\nwithout a word, and he crouched laughing in my face, an arm came\nsqueezing out, keys in hand; one was turned in either of the two great\npadlocks, the whole lid lifted, and out stepped Raffles like the\nconjurer he was.\n\n\"So you were the burglar!\" I exclaimed at last.  \"Well, I am just as\nglad I didn't know.\"\n\nHe had wrung my hand already, but at this he fairly mangled it in his.\n\n\"You dear little brick,\" he cried, \"that's the one thing of all things\nI longed to hear you say!  How could you have behaved as you've done if\nyou had known?  How could any living man?  How could you have acted, as\nthe polar star of all the stages could not have acted in your place?\nRemember that I have heard a lot, and as good as seen as much as I've\nheard.  Bunny, I don't know where you were greatest: at the Albany,\nhere, or at your bank!\"\n\n\"I don't know where I was most miserable,\" I rejoined, beginning to see\nthe matter in a less perfervid light.  \"I know you don't credit me with\nmuch finesse, but I would undertake to be in the secret and to do quite\nas well; the only difference would be in my own peace of mind, which,\nof course, doesn't count.\"\n\nBut Raffles wagged away with his most charming and disarming smile; he\nwas in old clothes, rather tattered and torn, and more than a little\ngrimy as to the face and hands, but, on the surface, wonderfully little\nthe worse for his experience.  And, as I say, his smile was the smile\nof the Raffles I loved best.\n\n\"You would have done your damnedest, Bunny!  There is no limit to your\nheroism; but you forget the human equation in the pluckiest of the\nplucky.  I couldn't afford to forget it, Bunny; I couldn't afford to\ngive a point away.  Don't talk as though I hadn't trusted you!  I\ntrusted my very life to your loyal tenacity.  What do you suppose would\nhave happened to me if you had let me rip in that strong-room?  Do you\nthink I would ever have crept out and given myself up?  Yes, I'll have\na peg for once; the beauty of all laws is in the breaking, even of the\nkind we make unto ourselves.\"\n\nI had a Sullivan for him, too; and in another minute he was spread out\non my sofa, stretching his cramped limbs with infinite gusto, a\ncigarette between his fingers, a yellow bumper at hand on the chest of\nhis triumph and my tribulation.\n\n\"Never mind when it occurred to me, Bunny; as a matter of fact, it was\nonly the other day, when I had decided to go away for the real reasons\nI have already given you.  I may have made more of them to you than I\ndo in my own mind, but at all events they exist.  And I really did want\nthe telephone and the electric light.\"\n\n\"But where did you stow the silver before you went?\"\n\n\"Nowhere; it was my luggage--a portmanteau, cricket-bag, and suit-case\nfull of very little else--and by the same token I left the lot at\nEuston, and one of us must fetch them this evening.\"\n\n\"I can do that,\" said I.  \"But did you really go all the way to Crewe?\"\n\n\"Didn't you get my note?  I went all the way to Crewe to post you those\nfew lines, my dear Bunny!  It's no use taking trouble if you don't take\ntrouble enough; I wanted you to show the proper set of faces at the\nbank and elsewhere, and I know you did.  Besides, there was an up-train\nfour minutes after mine got in.  I simply posted my letter in Crewe\nstation, and changed from one train to the other.\"\n\n\"At two in the morning!\"\n\n\"Nearer three, Bunny.  It was after seven when I slung in with the\nDaily Mail.  The milk had beaten me by a short can.  But even so I had\ntwo very good hours before you were due.\"\n\n\"And to think,\" I murmured, \"how you deceived me there!\"\n\n\"With your own assistance,\" said Raffles laughing.  \"If you had looked\nit up you would have seen there was no such train in the morning, and I\nnever said there was.  But I meant you to be deceived, Bunny, and I\nwon't say I didn't--it was all for the sake of the side!  Well, when\nyou carted me away with such laudable despatch, I had rather an\nuncomfortable half-hour, but that was all just then.  I had my candle,\nI had matches, and lots to read. It was quite nice in that strong-room\nuntil a very unpleasant incident occurred.\"\n\n\"Do tell me, my dear fellow!\"\n\n\"I must have another Sullivan--thank you--and a match.  The unpleasant\nincident was steps outside and a key in the lock!  I was disporting\nmyself on the lid of the trunk at the time.  I had barely time to knock\nout my light and slip down behind it.  Luckily it was only another box\nof sorts; a jewel-case, to be more precise; you shall see the contents\nin a moment.  The Easter exodus has done me even better than I dared to\nhope.\"\n\nHis words reminded me of the Pall Mall Gazette, which I had brought in\nmy pocket from the Turkish bath.  I fished it out, all wrinkled and\nbloated by the heat of the hottest room, and handed it to Raffles with\nmy thumb upon the leaded paragraphs.\n\n\"Delightful!\" said he when he had read them.  \"More thieves than one,\nand the coal-cellar of all places as a way in!  I certainly tried to\ngive it that appearance.  I left enough candle-grease there to make\nthose coals burn bravely.  But it looked up into a blind backyard,\nBunny, and a boy of eight couldn't have squeezed through the trap. Long\nmay that theory keep them happy at Scotland Yard!\"\n\n\"But what about the fellow you knocked out?\" I asked.  \"That was not\nlike you, Raffles.\"\n\nRaffles blew pensive rings as he lay back on my sofa, his black hair\ntumbled on the cushion, his pale profile as clear and sharp against the\nlight as though slashed out with the scissors.\n\n\"I know it wasn't, Bunny,\" he said regretfully.  \"But things like that,\nas the poet will tell you, are really inseparable from victories like\nmine.  It had taken me a couple of hours to break out of that\nstrong-room; I was devoting a third to the harmless task of simulating\nthe appearance of having broken in; and it was then I heard the\nfellow's stealthy step.  Some might have stood their ground and killed\nhim; more would have bolted into a worse corner than they were in\nalready.  I left my candle where it was, crept to meet the poor devil,\nflattened myself against the wall, and let him have it as he passed.  I\nacknowledge the foul blow, but here's evidence that it was mercifully\nstruck.  The victim has already told his tale.\"\n\nAs he drained his glass, but shook his head when I wished to replenish\nit, Raffles showed me the flask which he had carried in his pocket: it\nwas still nearly full; and I found that he had otherwise provisioned\nhimself over the holidays.  On either Easter Day or Bank Holiday, had I\nfailed him, it had been his intention to make the best escape he could.\nBut the risk must have been enormous, and it filled my glowing skin to\nthink that he had not relied on me in vain.\n\nAs for his gleanings from such jewel-cases as were spending the Easter\nrecess in the strong-room of my bank, (without going into rhapsodies or\neven particulars on the point,) I may mention that they realized enough\nfor me to join Raffles on his deferred holiday in Scotland, besides\nenabling him to play more regularly for Middlesex in the ensuing summer\nthan had been the case for several seasons.  In fine, this particular\nexploit entirely justified itself in my eyes, in spite of the\nsuperfluous (but invariable) secretiveness which I could seldom help\nresenting in my heart I never thought less of it than in the present\ninstance; and my one mild reproach was on the subject of the phantom\nCrawshay.\n\n\"You let me think he was in the air again,\" I said.  \"But it wouldn't\nsurprise me to find that you had never heard of him since the day of\nhis escape through your window.\"\n\n\"I never even thought of him, Bunny, until you came to see me the day\nbefore yesterday, and put him into my head with your first words. The\nwhole point was to make you as genuinely anxious about the plate as you\nmust have seemed all along the line.\"\n\n\"Of course I see your point,\" I rejoined; \"but mine is that you labored\nit.  You needn't have written me a downright lie about the fellow.\"\n\n\"Nor did I, Bunny.\"\n\n\"Not about the 'prince of professors' being 'in the offing' when you\nleft?\"\n\n\"My dear Bunny, but so he was!\" cried Raffles.  \"Time was when I was\nnone too pure an amateur.  But after this I take leave to consider\nmyself a professor of the professors.  And I should like to see one\nmore capable of skippering their side!\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Rest Cure\n\nI had not seen Raffles for a month or more, and I was sadly in need of\nhis advice.  My life was being made a burden to me by a wretch who had\nobtained a bill of sale over the furniture in Mount Street, and it was\nonly by living elsewhere that I could keep the vulpine villain from my\ndoor.  This cost ready money, and my balance at the bank was sorely in\nneed of another lift from Raffles.  Yet, had he been in my shoes, he\ncould not have vanished more effectually than he had done, both from\nthe face of the town and from the ken of all who knew him.\n\nIt was late in August; he never played first-class cricket after July,\nwhen, a scholastic understudy took his place in the Middlesex eleven.\nAnd in vain did I scour my Field and my Sportsman for the country-house\nmatches with which he wilfully preferred to wind up the season; the\nmatches were there, but never the magic name of A. J. Raffles.  Nothing\nwas known of him at the Albany; he had left no instructions about his\nletters, either there or at the club.  I began to fear that some evil\nhad overtaken him.  I scanned the features of captured criminals in the\nillustrated Sunday papers; on each occasion I breathed again; nor was\nanything worthy of Raffles going on.  I will not deny that I was less\nanxious on his account than on my own.  But it was a double relief to\nme when he gave a first characteristic sign of life.\n\nI had called at the Albany for the fiftieth time, and returned to\nPiccadilly in my usual despair, when a street sloucher sidled up to me\nin furtive fashion and inquired if my name was what it is.\n\n\"'Cause this 'ere's for you,\" he rejoined to my affirmative, and with\nthat I felt a crumpled note in my palm.\n\nIt was from Raffles.  I smoothed out the twisted scrap of paper, and on\nit were just a couple of lines in pencil:\n\n\"Meet me in Holland Walk at dark to-night.  Walk up and down till I\ncome.                                           A.  J.  R.\"\n\nThat was all!  Not another syllable after all these weeks, and the few\nwords scribbled in a wild caricature of his scholarly and dainty hand!\nI was no longer to be alarmed by this sort of thing; it was all so like\nthe Raffles I loved least; and to add to my indignation, when at length\nI looked up from the mysterious missive, the equally mysterious\nmessenger had disappeared in a manner worthy of the whole affair.  He\nwas, however, the first creature I espied under the tattered trees of\nHolland Walk that evening.\n\n\"Seen 'im yet?\" he inquired confidentially, blowing a vile cloud from\nhis horrid pipe.\n\n\"No, I haven't; and I want to know where you've seen him,\" I replied\nsternly.  \"Why did you run away like that the moment you had given me\nhis note?\"\n\n\"Orders, orders,\" was the reply.  \"I ain't such a juggins as to go agen\na toff as makes it worf while to do as I'm bid an' 'old me tongue.\"\n\n\"And who may you be?\" I asked jealously.  \"And what are you to Mr.\nRaffles?\"\n\n\"You silly ass, Bunny, don't tell all Kensington that I'm in town!\"\nreplied my tatterdemalion, shooting up and smoothing out into a merely\nshabby Raffles.  \"Here, take my arm--I'm not so beastly as I look.  But\nneither am I in town, nor in England, nor yet on the face of the earth,\nfor all that's known of me to a single soul but you.\"\n\n\"Then where are you,\" I asked, \"between ourselves?\"\n\n\"I've taken a house near here for the holidays, where I'm going in for\na Rest Cure of my own description.  Why?  Oh, for lots of reasons, my\ndear Bunny; among others, I have long had a wish to grow my own beard;\nunder the next lamppost you will agree that it's training on very\nnicely.  Then, you mayn't know it, but there's a canny man at Scotland\nYard who has had a quiet eye on me longer than I like.  I thought it\nabout time to have an eye on him, and I stared him in the face outside\nthe Albany this very morning.  That was when I saw you go in, and\nscribbled a line to give you when you came out.  If he had caught us\ntalking he would have spotted me at once.\"\n\n\"So you are lying low out here!\"\n\n\"I prefer to call it my Rest Cure,\" returned Raffles, \"and it's really\nnothing else.  I've got a furnished house at a time when no one else\nwould have dreamed of taking one in town; and my very neighbors don't\nknow I'm there, though I'm bound to say there are hardly any of them at\nhome.  I don't keep a servant, and do everything for myself.  It's the\nnext best fun to a desert island. Not that I make much work, for I'm\nreally resting, but I haven't done so much solid reading for years.\nRather a joke, Bunny: the man whose house I've taken is one of her\nMajesty's inspectors of prisons, and his study's a storehouse of\ncriminology.  It has been quite amusing to lie on one's back and have a\ngood look at one's self as others fondly imagine they see one.\"\n\n\"But surely you get some exercise?\" I asked; for he was leading me at a\ngood rate through the leafy byways of Camp den Hill; and his step was\nas springy and as light as ever.\n\n\"The best exercise I ever had in my life,\" said Raffles; \"and you would\nnever live to guess what it is.  It's one of the reasons why I went in\nfor this seedy kit.  I follow cabs.  Yes, Bunny, I turn out about dusk\nand meet the expresses at Euston or King's Cross; that is, of course, I\nloaf outside and pick my cab, and often run my three or four miles for\na bob or less.  And it not only keeps you in the very pink: if you're\ngood they let you carry the trunks up-stairs; and I've taken notes from\nthe inside of more than one commodious residence which will come in\nuseful in the autumn.  In fact, Bunny, what with these new Rowton\nhouses, my beard, and my otherwise well-spent holiday, I hope to have\nquite a good autumn season before the erratic Raffles turns up in town.\"\n\nI felt it high time to wedge in a word about my own far less\nsatisfactory affairs.  But it was not necessary for me to recount half\nmy troubles.  Raffles could be as full of himself as many a worse man,\nand I did not like his society the less for these human outpourings.\nThey had rather the effect of putting me on better terms with myself,\nthrough bringing him down to my level for the time being.  But his\negoism was not even skin-deep; it was rather a cloak, which Raffles\ncould cast off quicker than any man I ever knew, as he did not fail to\nshow me now.\n\n\"Why, Bunny, this is the very thing!\" he cried.  \"You must come and\nstay with me, and we'll lie low side by side.  Only remember it really\nis a Rest Cure.  I want to keep literally as quiet as I was without\nyou.  What do you say to forming ourselves at once into a practically\nSilent Order?  You agree?  Very well, then, here's the street and\nthat's the house.\"\n\nIt was ever such a quiet little street, turning out of one of those\nwhich climb right over the pleasant hill.  One side was monopolized by\nthe garden wall of an ugly but enviable mansion standing in its own\nground; opposite were a solid file of smaller but taller houses; on\nneither side were there many windows alight, nor a solitary soul on the\npavement or in the road.  Raffles led the way to one of the small tall\nhouses.  It stood immediately behind a lamppost, and I could not but\nnotice that a love-lock of Virginia creeper was trailing almost to the\nstep, and that the bow-window on the ground floor was closely\nshuttered.  Raffles admitted himself with his latch-key, and I squeezed\npast him into a very narrow hall.  I did not hear him shut the door,\nbut we were no longer in the lamplight, and he pushed softly past me in\nhis turn.\n\n\"I'll get a light,\" he muttered as he went; but to let him pass I had\nleaned against some electric switches, and while 'his back was turned I\ntried one of these without thinking.  In an instant hall and staircase\nwere flooded with light; in another Raffles was upon me in a fury, and,\nall was dark once more.  He had not said a word, but I heard him\nbreathing through his teeth.\n\nNor was there anything to tell me now.  The mere flash of electric\nlight upon a hail of chaos and uncarpeted stairs, and on the face of\nRaffles as he sprang to switch it off, had been enough even for me.\n\n\"So this is how you have taken the house,\" said I in his own undertone.\n\"'Taken' is good; 'taken' is beautiful!\"\n\n\"Did you think I'd done it through an agent?\" he snarled.  \"Upon my\nword, Bunny, I did you the credit of supposing you saw the joke all the\ntime!\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't you take a house,\" I asked, \"and pay for it?\"\n\n\"Why should I,\" he retorted, \"within three miles of the Albany?\nBesides, I should have had no peace; and I meant every word I said\nabout my Rest Cure.\"\n\n\"You are actually staying in a house where you've broken in to steal?\"\n\n\"Not to steal, Bunny!  I haven't stolen a thing.  But staying here I\ncertainly am, and having the most complete rest a busy man could wish.\"\n\n\"There'll be no rest for me!\"\n\nRaffles laughed as he struck a match.  I had followed him into what\nwould have been the back drawing-room in the ordinary little London\nhouse; the inspector of prisons had converted it into a separate study\nby filling the folding doors with book-shelves, which I scanned at once\nfor the congenial works of which Raffles had spoken.  I was not able to\ncarry my examination very far.  Raffles had lighted a candle, stuck (by\nits own grease) in the crown of an opera hat, which he opened the\nmoment the wick caught.  The light thus struck the ceiling in an oval\nshaft, which left the rest of the room almost as dark as it had been\nbefore.\n\n\"Sorry, Bunny!\" said Raffles, sitting on one pedestal of a desk from\nwhich the top had been removed, and setting his makeshift lantern on\nthe other.  \"In broad daylight, when it can't be spotted from the\noutside, you shall have as much artificial light as you like.  If you\nwant to do some writing, that's the top of the desk on end against the\nmantlepiece.  You'll never have a better chance so far as interruption\ngoes.  But no midnight oil or electricity!  You observe that their last\ncare was to fix up these shutters; they appear to have taken the top\noff the desk to get at 'em without standing on it; but the beastly\nthings wouldn't go all the way up, and the strip they leave would give\nus away to the backs of the other houses if we lit up after dark.  Mind\nthat telephone!  If you touch the receiver they will know at the\nexchange that the house is not empty, and I wouldn't put it past the\ncolonel to have told them exactly how long he was going to be away.\nHe's pretty particular: look at the strips of paper to keep the dust\noff his precious books!\"\n\n\"Is he a colonel?\" I asked, perceiving that Raffles referred to the\nabsentee householder.\n\n\"Of sappers,\" he replied, \"and a V.C. into the bargain, confound him!\nGot it at Rorke's Drift; prison governor or inspector ever since;\nfavorite recreation, what do you think?  Revolver shooting!  You can\nread all about him in his own Who's Who.  A devil of a chap to tackle,\nBunny, when he's at home!\"\n\n\"And where is he now?\" I asked uneasily.  \"And do you know he isn't on\nhis way home?\"\n\n\"Switzerland,\" replied Raffles, chuckling; \"he wrote one too many\nlabels, and was considerate enough to leave it behind for our guidance.\nWell, no one ever comes back from Switzerland at the beginning of\nSeptember, you know; and nobody ever thinks of coming back before the\nservants. When they turn up they won't get in.  I keep the latch\njammed, but the servants will think it's jammed itself, and while\nthey're gone for the locksmith we shall walk out like gentlemen--if we\nhaven't done so already.\"\n\n\"As you walked in, I suppose?\"\n\nRaffles shook his head in the dim light to which my sight was growing\ninured.\n\n\"No, Bunny, I regret to say I came in through the dormer window. They\nwere painting next door but one.  I never did like ladder work, but it\ntakes less time than in picking a lock in the broad light of a street\nlamp.\"\n\n\"So they left you a latch-key as well as everything else!\"\n\n\"No, Bunny.  I was just able to make that for myself.  I am playing at\n'Robinson Crusoe,' not 'The Swiss Family Robinson.'  And now, my dear\nFriday, if you will kindly take off those boots, we can explore the\nisland before we turn in for the night.\"\n\nThe stairs were very steep and narrow, and they creaked alarmingly as\nRaffles led the way up, with the single candle in the crown of the\ncolonel's hat.  He blew it out before we reached the half-landing,\nwhere a naked window stared upon the backs of the houses in the next\nroad, but lit it again at the drawing-room door.  I just peeped in upon\na semi-grand swathed in white and a row of water colors mounted in\ngold.  An excellent bathroom broke our journey to the second floor.\n\n\"I'll have one to-night,\" said I, taking heart of a luxury unknown in\nmy last sordid sanctuary.\n\n\"You'll do no such thing,\" snapped Raffles.  \"Have the goodness to\nremember that our island is one of a group inhabited by hostile tribes.\nYou can fill the bath quietly if you try, but it empties under the\nstudy window, and makes the very devil of a noise about it.  No, Bunny,\nI bale out every drop and pour it away through the scullery sink, so\nyou will kindly consult me before you turn a tap. Here's your room;\nhold the light outside while I draw the curtains; it's the old chap's\ndressing-room.  Now you can bring the glim. How's that for a jolly\nwardrobe?  And look at his coats on their cross-trees inside: dapper\nold dog, shouldn't you say?  Mark the boots on the shelf above, and the\nlittle brass rail for his ties! Didn't I tell you he was particular?\nAnd wouldn't he simply love to catch us at his kit?\"\n\n\"Let's only hope it would give him an apoplexy,\" said I shuddering.\n\n\"I shouldn't build on it,\" replied Raffles.  \"That's a big man's\ntrouble, and neither you nor I could get into the old chap's clothes.\nBut come into the best bedroom, Bunny.  You won't think me selfish if I\ndon't give it up to you?  Look at this, my boy, look at this! It's the\nonly one I use in all the house.\"\n\nI had followed him into a good room, with ample windows closely\ncurtained, and he had switched on the light in a hanging lamp at the\nbedside.  The rays fell from a thick green funnel in a plateful of\nstrong light upon a table deep in books.  I noticed several volumes of\nthe \"Invasion of the Crimea.\"\n\n\"That's where I rest the body and exercise the brain,\" said Raffles. \"I\nhave long wanted to read my Kinglake from A to Z, and I manage about a\nvolume a night.  There's a style for you, Bunny!  I love the\npunctilious thoroughness of the whole thing; one can understand its\nappeal to our careful colonel.  His name, did you say?  Crutchley,\nBunny--Colonel Crutchley, R.E., V.C.\"\n\n\"We'd put his valor to the test!\" said I, feeling more valiant myself\nafter our tour of inspection.\n\n\"Not so loud on the stairs,\" whispered Raffles.  \"There's only one door\nbetween us and--\"\n\nRaffles stood still at my feet, and well he might!  A deafening double\nknock had resounded through the empty house; and to add to the utter\nhorror of the moment, Raffles instantly blew out the light. I heard my\nheart pounding.  Neither of us breathed.  We were on our way down to\nthe first landing, and for a moment we stood like mice; then Raffles\nheaved a deep sigh, and in the depths I heard the gate swing home.\n\n\"Only the postman, Bunny!  He will come now and again, though they have\nobviously left instructions at the post-office.  I hope the old colonel\nwill let them have it when he gets back.  I confess it gave me a turn.\"\n\n\"Turn!\" I gasped.  \"I must have a drink, if I die for it.\"\n\n\"My dear Bunny, that's no part of my Rest Cure.\"\n\n\"Then good-by!  I can't stand it; feel my forehead; listen to my heart!\nCrusoe found a footprint, but he never heard a double-knock at the\nstreet door!\"\n\n\"'Better live in the midst of alarms,'\" quoted Raffles, \"'than dwell in\nthis horrible place.'  I must confess we get it both ways, Bunny. Yet\nI've nothing but tea in the house.\"\n\n\"And where do you make that?  Aren't you afraid of smoke?\"\n\n\"There's a gas-stove in the dining-room.\"\n\n\"But surely to goodness,\" I cried, \"there's a cellar lower down!\"\n\n\"My dear, good Bunny,\" said Raffles, \"I've told you already that I\ndidn't come in here on business.  I came in for the Cure.  Not a penny\nwill these people be the worse, except for their washing and their\nelectric light, and I mean to leave enough to cover both items.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said I, \"since Brutus is such a very honorable man, we will\nborrow a bottle from the cellar, and replace it before we go.\"\n\nRaffles slapped me softly on the back, and I knew that I had gained my\npoint.  It was often the case when I had the presence of heart and mind\nto stand up to him.  But never was little victory of mine quite so\ngrateful as this.  Certainly it was a very small cellar, indeed a mere\ncupboard under the kitchen stairs, with a most ridiculous lock.  Nor\nwas this cupboard overstocked with wine.  But I made out a jar of\nwhiskey, a shelf of Zeltinger, another of claret, and a short one at\nthe top which presented a little battery of golden-leafed necks and\ncorks.  Raffles set his hand no lower.  He examined the labels while I\nheld folded hat and naked light.\n\n\"Mumm, '84!\" he whispered.  \"G. H. Mumm, and A.D. 1884!  I am no\nwine-bibber, Bunny, as you know, but I hope you appreciate the\nspecifications as I do.  It looks to me like the only bottle, the last\nof its case, and it does seem a bit of a shame; but more shame for the\nmiser who hoards in his cellar what was meant for mankind! Come, Bunny,\nlead the way.  This baby is worth nursing.  It would break my heart if\nanything happened to it now!\"\n\nSo we celebrated my first night in the furnished house; and I slept\nbeyond belief, slept as I never was to sleep there again.  But it was\nstrange to hear the milkman in the early morning, and the postman\nknocking his way along the street an hour later, and to be passed over\nby one destroying angel after another.  I had come down early enough,\nand watched through the drawing-room blind the cleansing of all the\nsteps in the street but ours.  Yet Raffles had evidently been up some\ntime; the house seemed far purer than overnight as though he had\nmanaged to air it room by room; and from the one with the gas-stove\nthere came a frizzling sound that fattened the heart.\n\nI only would I had the pen to do justice to the week I spent in-doors\non Campden Hill!  It might make amusing reading; the reality for me was\nfar removed from the realm of amusement.  Not that I was denied many a\nlaugh of suppressed heartiness when Raffles and I were together.  But\nhalf our time we very literally saw nothing of each other.  I need not\nsay whose fault that was.  He would be quiet; he was in ridiculous and\noffensive earnest about his egregious Cure. Kinglake he would read by\nthe hour together, day and night, by the hanging lamp, lying up-stairs\non the best bed.  There was daylight enough for me in the drawing-room\nbelow; and there I would sit immersed in criminous tomes weakly\nfascinated until I shivered and shook in my stocking soles.  Often I\nlonged to do something hysterically desperate, to rouse Raffles and\nbring the street about our ears; once I did bring him about mine by\nstriking a single note on the piano, with the soft pedal down.  His\nneglect of me seemed wanton at the time.  I have long realized that he\nwas only wise to maintain silence at the expense of perilous amenities,\nand as fully justified in those secret and solitary sorties which made\nbad blood in my veins.  He was far cleverer than I at getting in and\nout; but even had I been his match for stealth and wariness, my company\nwould have doubled every risk.  I admit now that he treated me with\nquite as much sympathy as common caution would permit.  But at the time\nI took it so badly as to plan a small revenge.\n\nWhat with his flourishing beard and the increasing shabbiness of the\nonly suit he had brought with him to the house, there was no denying\nthat Raffles had now the advantage of a permanent disguise. That was\nanother of his excuses for leaving me as he did, and it was the one I\nwas determined to remove.  On a morning, therefore, when I awoke to\nfind him flown again, I proceeded to execute a plan which I had already\nmatured in my mind.  Colonel Crutchley was a married man; there were no\nsigns of children in the house; on the other hand, there was much\nevidence that the wife was a woman of fashion.  Her dresses overflowed\nthe wardrobe and her room; large, flat, cardboard boxes were to be\nfound in every corner of the upper floors.  She was a tall woman; I was\nnot too tall a man.  Like Raffles, I had not shaved on Campden Hill.\nThat morning, however, I did my best with a very fair razor which the\ncolonel had left behind in my room; then I turned out the lady's\nwardrobe and the cardboard boxes, and took my choice.\n\nI have fair hair, and at the time it was rather long.  With a pair of\nMrs. Crutchley's tongs and a discarded hair-net, I was able to produce\nan almost immodest fringe.  A big black hat with a wintry feather\ncompleted a headdress as unseasonable as my skating skirt and feather\nboa; of course, the good lady had all her summer frocks away with her\nin Switzerland.  This was all the more annoying from the fact that we\nwere having a very warm September; so I was not sorry to hear Raffles\nreturn as I was busy adding a layer of powder to my heated countenance.\nI listened a moment on the landing, but as he went into the study I\ndetermined to complete my toilet in every detail.  My idea was first to\ngive him the fright he deserved, and secondly to show him that I was\nquite as fit to move abroad as he.  It was, however, I confess, a pair\nof the colonel's gloves that I was buttoning as I slipped down to the\nstudy even more quietly than usual.  The electric light was on, as it\ngenerally was by day, and under it stood as formidable a figure as ever\nI encountered in my life of crime.\n\nImagine a thin but extremely wiry man, past middle age, brown and\nbloodless as any crabapple, but as coolly truculent and as casually\nalert as Raffles at his worst.  It was, it could only be, the\nfire-eating and prison-inspecting colonel himself!  He was ready for\nme, a revolver in his hand, taken, as I could see, from one of those\nlocked drawers in the pedestal desk with which Raffles had refused to\ntamper; the drawer was open, and a bunch of keys depended from the\nlock.  A grim smile crumpled up the parchment face, so that one eye was\npuckered out of sight; the other was propped open by an eyeglass,\nwhich, however, dangled on its string when I appeared.\n\n\"A woman, begad!\" the warrior exclaimed.  \"And where's the man, you\nscarlet hussy?\"\n\nNot a word could I utter.  But, in my horror and my amazement, I have\nno sort of doubt that I acted the part I had assumed in a manner I\nnever should have approached in happier circumstances.\n\n\"Come, come, my lass,\" cried the old oak veteran, \"I'm not going to put\na bullet through you, you know!  You tell me all about it, and it'll do\nyou more good than harm.  There, I'll put the nasty thing away and--God\nbless me, if the brazen wench hasn't squeezed into the wife's kit!\"\n\nA squeeze it happened to have been, and in my emotion it felt more of\none than ever; but his sudden discovery had not heightened the\nveteran's animosity against me.  On the contrary, I caught a glint of\nhumor through his gleaming glass, and he proceeded to pocket his\nrevolver like the gentleman he was.\n\n\"Well, well, it's lucky I looked in,\" he continued.  \"I only came round\non the off-chance of letters, but if I hadn't you'd have had another\nweek in clover.  Begad, though, I saw your handwriting the moment I'd\ngot my nose inside!  Now just be sensible and tell me where your good\nman is.\"\n\nI had no man.  I was alone, had broken in alone.  There was not a soul\nin the affair (much less the house) except myself.  So much I stuttered\nout in tones too hoarse to betray me on the spot.  But the old man of\nthe world shook a hard old head.\n\n\"Quite right not to give away your pal,\" said he.  \"But I'm not one of\nthe marines, my dear, and you mustn't expect me to swallow all that.\nWell, if you won't say, you won't, and we must just send for those who\nwill.\"\n\nIn a flash I saw his fell design.  The telephone directory lay open on\none of the pedestals.  He must have been consulting it when he heard me\non the stairs; he had another look at it now; and that gave me my\nopportunity.  With a presence of mind rare enough in me to excuse the\nboast, I flung myself upon the instrument in the corner and hurled it\nto the ground with all my might.  I was myself sent spinning into the\nopposite corner at the same instant.  But the instrument happened to be\na standard of the more elaborate pattern, and I flattered myself that I\nhad put the delicate engine out of action for the day.\n\nNot that my adversary took the trouble to ascertain.  He was looking at\nme strangely in the electric light, standing intently on his guard, his\nright hand in the pocket where he had dropped his revolver.  And I--I\nhardly knew it--but I caught up the first thing handy for self-defence,\nand was brandishing the bottle which Raffles and I had emptied in honor\nof my arrival on this fatal scene.\n\n\"Be shot if I don't believe you're the man himself!\" cried the colonel,\nshaking an armed fist in my face.  \"You young wolf in sheep's clothing.\nBeen at my wine, of course!  Put down that bottle; down with it this\ninstant, or I'll drill a tunnel through your middle.  I thought so!\nBegad, sir, you shall pay for this! Don't you give me an excuse for\npotting you now, or I'll jump at the chance!  My last bottle of\n'84--you miserable blackguard--you unutterable beast!\"\n\nHe had browbeaten me into his own chair in his own corner; he was\nstanding over me, empty bottle in one hand, revolver in the other, and\nmurder itself in the purple puckers of his raging face.  His language I\nwill not even pretend to indicate: his skinny throat swelled and\ntrembled with the monstrous volleys.  He could smile at my appearance\nin his wife's clothes; he would have had my blood for the last bottle\nof his best champagne.  His eyes were not hidden now; they needed no\neyeglass to prop them open; large with fury, they started from the\nlivid mask.  I watched nothing else.  I could not understand why they\nshould start out as they did.  I did not try. I say I watched nothing\nelse--until I saw the face of Raffles over the unfortunate officer's\nshoulder.\n\nRaffles had crept in unheard while our altercation was at its height,\nhad watched his opportunity, and stolen on his man unobserved by either\nof us.  While my own attention was completely engrossed, he had seized\nthe colonel's pistol-hand and twisted it behind the colonel's back\nuntil his eyes bulged out as I have endeavored to describe.  But the\nfighting man had some fight in him still; and scarcely had I grasped\nthe situation when he hit out venomously behind with the bottle, which\nwas smashed to bits on Raffles's shin. Then I threw my strength into\nthe scale; and before many minutes we had our officer gagged and bound\nin his chair.  But it was not one of our bloodless victories.  Raffles\nhad been cut to the bone by the broken glass; his leg bled wherever he\nlimped; and the fierce eyes of the bound man followed the wet trail\nwith gleams of sinister satisfaction.\n\nI thought I had never seen a man better bound or better gagged.  But\nthe humanity seemed to have run out of Raffles with his blood.  He tore\nup tablecloths, he cut down blind-cords, he brought the dust-sheets\nfrom the drawing-room, and multiplied every bond.  The unfortunate\nman's legs were lashed to the legs of his chair, his arms to its arms,\nhis thighs and back fairly welded to the leather. Either end of his own\nruler protruded from his bulging cheeks--the middle was hidden by his\nmoustache--and the gag kept in place by remorseless lashings at the\nback of his head.  It was a spectacle I could not bear to contemplate\nat length, while from the first I found myself physically unable to\nface the ferocious gaze of those implacable eyes.  But Raffles only\nlaughed at my squeamishness, and flung a dust-sheet over man and chair;\nand the stark outline drove me from the room.\n\nIt was Raffles at his worst, Raffles as I never knew him before or\nafter--a Raffles mad with pain and rage, and desperate as any other\ncriminal in the land.  Yet he had struck no brutal blow, he had uttered\nno disgraceful taunt, and probably not inflicted a tithe of the pain he\nhad himself to bear.  It is true that he was flagrantly in the wrong,\nhis victim as laudably in the right.  Nevertheless, granting the\noriginal sin of the situation, and given this unforeseen development,\neven I failed to see how Raffles could have combined greater humanity\nwith any regard for our joint safety; and had his barbarities ended\nhere, I for one should not have considered them an extraordinary\naggravation of an otherwise minor offence.  But in the broad daylight\nof the bathroom, which had a ground-glass window but no blind, I saw at\nonce the serious nature of his wound and of its effect upon the man.\n\n\"It will maim me for a month,\" said he; \"and if the V.C. comes out\nalive, the wound he gave may be identified with the wound I've got.\"\n\nThe V.C.!  There, indeed, was an aggravation to one illogical mind. But\nto cast a moment's doubt upon the certainty of his coming out alive!\n\n\"Of course he'll come out,\" said I.  \"We must make up our minds to\nthat.\"\n\n\"Did he tell you he was expecting the servants or his wife?  If so, of\ncourse we must hurry up.\"\n\n\"No, Raffles, I'm afraid he's not expecting anybody.  He told me, if he\nhadn't looked in for letters, we should have had the place to ourselves\nanother week.  That's the worst of it.\"\n\nRaffles smiled as he secured a regular puttee of dust-sheeting. No\nblood was coming through.\n\n\"I don't agree, Bunny,\" said he.  \"It's quite the best of it, if you\nask me.\"\n\n\"What, that he should die the death?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nAnd Raffles stared me out with a hard and merciless light in his clear\nblue eyes--a light that chilled the blood.\n\n\"If it's a choice between his life and our liberty, you're entitled to\nyour decision and I'm entitled to mine, and I took it before I bound\nhim as I did,\" said Raffles.  \"I'm only sorry I took so much trouble if\nyou're going to stay behind and put him in the way of releasing himself\nbefore he gives up the ghost.  Perhaps you will go and think it over\nwhile I wash my bags and dry 'em at the gas stove.  It will take me at\nleast an hour, which will just give me time to finish the last volume\nof Kinglake.\"\n\nLong before he was ready to go, however, I was waiting in the hall,\nclothed indeed, but not in a mind which I care to recall.  Once or\ntwice I peered into the dining-room where Raffles sat before the stove,\nwithout letting him hear me.  He, too, was ready for the street at a\nmoment's notice; but a steam ascended from his left leg, as he sat\nimmersed in his red volume.  Into the study I never went again; but\nRaffles did, to restore to its proper shelf this and every other book\nhe had taken out and so destroy that clew to the manner of man who had\nmade himself at home in the house.  On his last visit I heard him whisk\noff the dust-sheet; then he waited a minute; and when he came out it\nwas to lead the way into the open air as though the accursed house\nbelonged to him.\n\n\"We shall be seen,\" I whispered at his heels.  \"Raffles, Raffles,\nthere's a policeman at the corner!\"\n\n\"I know him intimately,\" replied Raffles, turning, however, the other\nway.  \"He accosted me on Monday, when I explained that I was an old\nsoldier of the colonel's regiment, who came in every few days to air\nthe place and send on any odd letters.  You see, I have always carried\none or two about me, redirected to that address in Switzerland, and\nwhen I showed them to him it was all right.  But after that it was no\nuse listening at the letter-box for a clear coast, was it?\"\n\nI did not answer; there was too much to exasperate in these prodigies\nof cunning which he could never trouble to tell me at the time.  And I\nknew why he had kept his latest feats to himself: unwilling to trust me\noutside the house, he had systematically exaggerated the dangers of his\nown walks abroad; and when to these injuries he added the insult of a\npatronizing compliment on my late disguise, I again made no reply.\n\n\"What's the good of your coming with me he asked, when I had followed\nhim across the main stream of Notting Hill.\n\n\"We may as well sink or swim together,\" I answered sullenly.\n\n\"Yes?  Well, I'm going to swim into the provinces, have a shave on the\nway, buy a new kit piecemeal, including a cricket-bag (which I really\nwant), and come limping back to the Albany with the same old strain in\nmy bowling leg.  I needn't add that I have been playing country-house\ncricket for the last month under an alias; it's the only decent way to\ndo it when one's county has need of one.  That's my itinerary, Bunny,\nbut I really can't see why you should come with me.\"\n\n\"We may as well swing together!\" I growled.\n\n\"As you will, my dear fellow,\" replied Raffles.  \"But I begin to dread\nyour company on the drop!\"\n\nI shall hold my pen on that provincial tour.  Not that I joined Raffles\nin any of the little enterprises with which he beguiled the breaks in\nour journey; our last deed in London was far too great a weight upon my\nsoul.  I could see that gallant officer in his chair, see him at every\nhour of the day and night, now with his indomitable eyes meeting mine\nferociously, now a stark outline underneath a sheet.  The vision\ndarkened my day and gave me sleepless nights.  I was with our victim in\nall his agony; my mind would only leave him for that gallows of which\nRaffles had said true things in jest.  No, I could not face so vile a\ndeath lightly, but I could meet it, somehow, better than I could endure\na guilty suspense.  In the watches of the second night I made up my\nmind to meet it halfway, that very morning, while still there might be\ntime to save the life that we had left in jeopardy.  And I got up early\nto tell Raffles of my resolve.\n\nHis room in the hotel where we were staying was littered with clothes\nand luggage new enough for any bridegroom; I lifted the locked\ncricket-bag, and found it heavier than a cricket-bag has any right to\nbe.  But in the bed Raffles was sleeping like an infant, his shaven\nself once more.  And when I shook him he awoke with a smile.\n\n\"Going to confess, eh, Bunny?  Well, wait a bit; the local police won't\nthank you for knocking them up at this hour.  And I bought a late\nedition which you ought to see; that must be it on the floor. You have\na look in the stop-press column, Bunny.\"\n\nI found the place with a sunken heart, and this is what I read:\n\n                 WEST-END OUTRAGE\n\n  Colonel Crutchley, R.E., V.C., has been the victim of a dastardly\n  outrage at his residence, Peter Street, Campden Hill.  Returning\n  unexpectedly to the house, which had been left untenanted during\n  the absence of the family abroad, it was found occupied by two\n  ruffians, who overcame and secured the distinguished officer by\n  the exercise of considerable violence.  When discovered through\n  the intelligence of the Kensington police, the gallant victim was\n  gagged and bound hand and foot, and in an advanced stage of\n  exhaustion.\n\n\n\"Thanks to the Kensington police,\" observed Raffles, as I read the last\nwords aloud in my horror.  \"They can't have gone when they got my\nletter.\"\n\n\"Your letter?\"\n\n\"I printed them a line while we were waiting for our train at Euston.\nThey must have got it that night, but they can't have paid any\nattention to it until yesterday morning.  And when they do, they take\nall the credit and give me no more than you did, Bunny!\"\n\nI looked at the curly head upon the pillow, at the smiling, handsome\nface under the curls.  And at last I understood.\n\n\"So all the time you never meant it!\"\n\n\"Slow murder?  You should have known me better.  A few hours' enforced\nRest Cure was the worst I wished him.\"\n\n\"'You might have told me, Raffles!\"\n\n\"That may be, Bunny, but you ought certainly to have trusted me!\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Criminologists' Club\n\n\"But who are they, Raffles, and where's their house?  There's no such\nclub on the list in Whitaker.\"\n\n\"The Criminologists, my dear Bunny, are too few for a local habitation,\nand too select to tell their name in Gath.  They are merely so many\nsolemn students of contemporary crime, who meet and dine periodically\nat each other's clubs or houses.\"\n\n\"But why in the world should they ask us to dine with them?\"\n\nAnd I brandished the invitation which had brought me hotfoot to the\nAlbany: it was from the Right Hon. the Earl of Thornaby, K.G.; and it\nrequested the honor of my company at dinner, at Thornaby House, Park\nLane, to meet the members of the Criminologists' Club.  That in itself\nwas a disturbing compliment: judge then of my dismay on learning that\nRaffles had been invited too!\n\n\"They have got it into their heads,\" said he, \"that the gladiatorial\nelement is the curse of most modern sport.  They tremble especially for\nthe professional gladiator.  And they want to know whether my\nexperience tallies with their theory.\"\n\n\"So they say!\"\n\n\"They quote the case of a league player, sus per coll., and any number\nof suicides.  It really is rather in my public line.\"\n\n\"In yours, if you like, but not in mine,\" said I.  \"No, Raffles,\nthey've got their eye on us both, and mean to put us under the\nmicroscope, or they never would have pitched on me.\"\n\nRaffles smiled on my perturbation.\n\n\"I almost wish you were right, Bunny!  It would be even better fun than\nI mean to make it as it is.  But it may console you to hear that it was\nI who gave them your name.  I told them you were a far keener\ncriminologist than myself.  I am delighted to hear they have taken my\nhint, and that we are to meet at their gruesome board.\"\n\n\"If I accept,\" said I, with the austerity he deserved.\n\n\"If you don't,\" rejoined Raffles, \"you will miss some sport after both\nour hearts.  Think of it, Bunny!  These fellows meet to wallow in all\nthe latest crimes; we wallow with them as though we knew more about it\nthan themselves.  Perhaps we don't, for few criminologists have a soul\nabove murder; and I quite expect to have the privilege of lifting the\ndiscussion into our own higher walk.  They shall give their morbid\nminds to the fine art of burgling, for a change; and while we're about\nit, Bunny, we may as well extract their opinion of our noble selves.\nAs authors, as collaborators, we will sit with the flower of our\ncritics, and find our own level in the expert eye. It will be a piquant\nexperience, if not an invaluable one; if we are sailing too near the\nwind, we are sure to hear about it, and can trim our yards accordingly.\nMoreover, we shall get a very good dinner into the bargain, or our\nnoble host will belie a European reputation.\"\n\n\"Do you know him?\" I asked.\n\n\"We have a pavilion acquaintance, when it suits my lord,\" replied\nRaffles, chuckling.  \"But I know all about him.  He was president one\nyear of the M.C.C., and we never had a better.  He knows the game,\nthough I believe he never played cricket in his life.  But then he\nknows most things, and has never done any of them.  He has never even\nmarried, and never opened his lips in the House of Lords. Yet they say\nthere is no better brain in the August assembly, and he certainly made\nus a wonderful speech last time the Australians were over.  He has read\neverything and (to his credit in these days) never written a line.  All\nround he is a whale for theory and a sprat for practice--but he looks\nquite capable of both at crime!\"\n\nI now longed to behold this remarkable peer, in the flesh, and with the\ngreater curiosity since another of the things which he evidently never\ndid was to have his photograph published for the benefit of the vulgar.\nI told Raffles that I would dine with him at Lord Thornaby's, and he\nnodded as though I had not hesitated for a moment. I see now how deftly\nhe had disposed of my reluctance.  No doubt he had thought it all out\nbefore: his little speeches look sufficiently premeditated as I set\nthem down at the dictates of an excellent memory.  Let it, however, be\nborne in mind that Raffles did not talk exactly like a Raffles book: he\nsaid the things, but he did not say them in so many consecutive\nbreaths.  They were punctuated by puffs from his eternal cigarette, and\nthe punctuation was often in the nature of a line of asterisks, while\nhe took a silent turn up and down his room.  Nor was he ever more\ndeliberate than when he seemed most nonchalant and spontaneous.  I came\nto see it in the end.  But these were early days, in which he was more\nplausible to me than I can hope to render him to another human being.\n\nAnd I saw a good deal of Raffles just then; it was, in fact, the one\nperiod at which I can remember his coming round to see me more\nfrequently than I went round to him.  Of course he would come at his\nown odd hours, often just as one was dressing to go out and dine, and I\ncan even remember finding him there when I returned, for I had long\nsince given him a key of the flat.  It was the inhospitable month of\nFebruary, and I can recall more than one cosy evening when we discussed\nanything and everything but our own malpractices; indeed, there were\nnone to discuss just then.  Raffles, on the contrary, was showing\nhimself with some industry in the most respectable society, and by his\nadvice I used the club more than ever.\n\n\"There is nothing like it at this time of year,\" said he.  \"In the\nsummer I have my cricket to provide me with decent employment in the\nsight of men.  Keep yourself before the public from morning to night,\nand they'll never think of you in the still small hours.\"\n\nOur behavior, in fine, had so long been irreproachable that I rose\nwithout misgiving on the morning of Lord Thornaby's dinner to the other\nCriminologists and guests.  My chief anxiety was to arrive under the\naegis of my brilliant friend, and I had begged him to pick me up on his\nway; but at five minutes to the appointed hour there was no sign of\nRaffles or his cab.  We were bidden at a quarter to eight for eight\no'clock, so after all I had to hurry off alone.\n\nFortunately, Thornaby House is almost at the end of my street that was;\nand it seemed to me another fortunate circumstance that the house stood\nback, as it did and does, in its own August courtyard; for, as I was\nabout to knock, a hansom came twinkling in behind me, and I drew back,\nhoping it was Raffles at the last moment.  It was not, and I knew it in\ntime to melt from the porch, and wait yet another minute in the\nshadows, since others were as late as I.  And out jumped these others,\nchattering in stage whispers as they paid their cab.\n\n\"Thornaby has a bet about it with Freddy Vereker, who can't come, I\nhear.  Of course, it won t be lost or won to-night.  But the dear man\nthinks he's been invited as a cricketer!\"\n\n\"I don't believe he's the other thing,\" said a voice as brusque as the\nfirst was bland.  \"I believe it's all bunkum.  I wish I didn't, but I\ndo!\"\n\n\"I think you'll find it's more than that,\" rejoined the other, as the\ndoors opened and swallowed the pair.\n\nI flung out limp hands and smote the air.  Raffles bidden to what he\nhad well called this \"gruesome board,\" not as a cricketer but, clearly,\nas a suspected criminal!  Raffles wrong all the time, and I right for\nonce in my original apprehension!  And still no Raffles in sight--no\nRaffles to warn--no Raffles, and the clocks striking eight!\n\nWell may I shirk the psychology of such a moment, for my belief is that\nthe striking clocks struck out all power of thought and feeling, and\nthat I played my poor part the better for that blessed surcease of\nintellectual sensation.  On the other hand, I was never more alive to\nthe purely objective impressions of any hour of my existence, and of\nthem the memory is startling to this day.  I hear my mad knock at the\ndouble doors; they fly open in the middle, and it is like some\nsumptuous and solemn rite.  A long slice of silken-legged lackey is\nseen on either hand; a very prelate of a butler bows a benediction from\nthe sanctuary steps.  I breathe more freely when I reach a book-lined\nlibrary where a mere handful of men do not overflow the Persian rug\nbefore the fire.  One of them is Raffles, who is talking to a large man\nwith the brow of a demi-god and the eyes and jowl of a degenerate\nbulldog.  And this is our noble host.\n\nLord Thornaby stared at me with inscrutable stolidity as we shook\nhands, and at once handed me over to a tall, ungainly man whom he\naddressed as Ernest, but whose surname I never learned.  Ernest in turn\nintroduced me, with a shy and clumsy courtesy, to the two remaining\nguests.  They were the pair who had driven up in the hansom; one turned\nout to be Kingsmill, Q.C.; the other I knew at a glance from his\nphotographs as Parrington, the backwoods novelist. They were admirable\nfoils to each other, the barrister being plump and dapper, with a\nNapoleonic cast of countenance, and the author one of the shaggiest\ndogs I have ever seen in evening-clothes. Neither took much stock of\nme, but both had an eye on Raffles as I exchanged a few words with each\nin turn.  Dinner, however, was immediately announced, and the six of us\nhad soon taken our places round a brilliant little table stranded in a\ngreat dark room.\n\nI had not been prepared for so small a party, and at first I felt\nrelieved.  If the worst came to the worst, I was fool enough to say in\nmy heart, they were but two to one.  But I was soon sighing for that\nsafety which the adage associates with numbers.  We were far too few\nfor the confidential duologue with one's neighbor in which I, at least,\nwould have taken refuge from the perils of a general conversation.  And\nthe general conversation soon resolved itself into an attack, so subtly\nconcerted and so artistically delivered that I could not conceive how\nRaffles should ever know it for an attack, and that against himself, or\nhow to warn him of his peril. But to this day I am not convinced that I\nalso was honored by the suspicions of the club; it may have been so,\nand they may have ignored me for the bigger game.\n\nIt was Lord Thornaby himself who fired the first shot, over the very\nsherry.  He had Raffles on his right hand, and the backwoodsman of\nletters on his left.  Raffles was hemmed in by the law on his right,\nwhile I sat between Parrington and Ernest, who took the foot of the\ntable, and seemed a sort of feudatory cadet of the noble house.  But it\nwas the motley lot of us that my lord addressed, as he sat back\nblinking his baggy eyes.\n\n\"Mr. Raffles,\" said he, \"has been telling me about that poor fellow who\nsuffered the extreme penalty last March.  A great end, gentlemen, a\ngreat end!  It is true that he had been unfortunate enough to strike a\njugular vein, but his own end should take its place among the most\nglorious traditions of the gallows.  You tell them Mr. Raffles: it will\nbe as new to my friends as it is to me.\"\n\n\"I tell the tale as I heard it last time I played at Trent Bridge; it\nwas never in the papers, I believe,\" said Raffles gravely.  \"You may\nremember the tremendous excitement over the Test Matches out in\nAustralia at the time: it seems that the result of the crucial game was\nexpected on the condemned man's last day on earth, and he couldn't rest\nuntil he knew it.  We pulled it off, if you recollect, and he said it\nwould make him swing happy.\"\n\n\"Tell 'em what else he said!\" cried Lord Thornaby, rubbing his podgy\nhands.\n\n\"The chaplain remonstrated with him on his excitement over a game at\nsuch a time, and the convict is said to have replied: 'Why, it's the\nfirst thing they'll ask me at the other end of the drop!'\"\n\nThe story was new even to me, but I had no time to appreciate its\npoints.  My concern was to watch its effect upon the other members of\nthe party.  Ernest, on my left, doubled up with laughter, and tittered\nand shook for several minutes.  My other neighbor, more impressionable\nby temperament, winced first, and then worked himself into a state of\nenthusiasm which culminated in an assault upon his shirt-cuff with a\njoiner's pencil.  Kingsmill, Q.C., beaming tranquilly on Raffles,\nseemed the one least impressed, until he spoke.\n\n\"I am glad to hear that,\" he remarked in a high bland voice.  \"I\nthought that man would die game.\"\n\n\"Did you know anything about him, then?\" inquired Lord Thornaby.\n\n\"I led for the Crown,\" replied the barrister, with a twinkle.  \"You\nmight almost say that I measured the poor man's neck.\"\n\nThe point must have been quite unpremeditated; it was not the less\neffective for that.  Lord Thornaby looked askance at the callous silk.\nIt was some moments before Ernest tittered and Parrington felt for his\npencil; and in the interim I had made short work of my hock, though it\nwas Johannisberger.  As for Raffles, one had but to see his horror to\nfeel how completely he was off his guard.\n\n\"In itself, I have heard, it was not a sympathetic case?\" was the\nremark with which he broke the general silence.\n\n\"Not a bit.\"\n\n\"That must have been a comfort to you,\" said Raffles dryly.\n\n\"It would have been to me,\" vowed our author, while the barrister\nmerely smiled.  \"I should have been very sorry to have had a hand in\nhanging Peckham and Solomons the other day.\"\n\n\"Why Peckham and Solomons?\" inquired my lord.\n\n\"They never meant to kill that old lady.\"\n\n\"But they strangled her in her bed with her own pillow-case!\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" said the uncouth scribe.  \"They didn't break in for\nthat.  They never thought of scragging her.  The foolish old person\nwould make a noise, and one of them tied too tight.  I call it jolly\nbad luck on them.\"\n\n\"On quiet, harmless, well-behaved thieves,\" added Lord Thornaby, \"in\nthe unobtrusive exercise of their humble avocation.\"\n\nAnd, as he turned to Raffles with his puffy smile, I knew that we had\nreached that part of the programme which had undergone rehearsal: it\nhad been perfectly timed to arrive with the champagne, and I was not\nafraid to signify my appreciation of that small mercy.  But Raffles\nlaughed so quickly at his lordship's humor, and yet with such a natural\nrestraint, as to leave no doubt that he had taken kindly to my own old\npart, and was playing the innocent inimitably in his turn, by reason of\nhis very innocence.  It was a poetic judgment on old Raffles, and in my\nmomentary enjoyment of the novel situation I was able to enjoy some of\nthe good things of this rich man's table. The saddle of mutton more\nthan justified its place in the menu; but it had not spoiled me for my\nwing of pheasant, and I was even looking forward to a sweet, when a\nfurther remark from the literary light recalled me from the table to\nits talk.\n\n\"But, I suppose,\" said he to Kingsmill, \"it's many a burglar you've\nrestored to his friends and his relations'?\"\n\n\"Let us say many a poor fellow who has been charged with burglary,\"\nreplied the cheery Q.C.  \"It's not quite the same thing, you know, nor\nis 'many' the most accurate word.  I never touch criminal work in town.\"\n\n\"It's the only kind I should care about,\" said the novelist, eating\njelly with a spoon.\n\n\"I quite agree with you,\" our host chimed in.  \"And of all the\ncriminals one might be called upon to defend, give me the enterprising\nburglar.\"\n\n\"It must be the breeziest branch of the business,\" remarked Raffles,\nwhile I held my breath.\n\nBut his touch was as light as gossamer, and his artless manner a\ntriumph of even his incomparable art.  Raffles was alive to the danger\nat last.  I saw him refuse more champagne, even as I drained my glass\nagain.  But it was not the same danger to us both.  Raffles had no\nreason to feel surprise or alarm at such a turn in a conversation\nfrankly devoted to criminology; it must have been as inevitable to him\nas it was sinister to me, with my fortuitous knowledge of the\nsuspicions that were entertained.  And there was little to put him on\nhis guard in the touch of his adversaries, which was only less light\nthan his own.\n\n\"I am not very fond of Mr. Sikes,\" announced the barrister, like a man\nwho had got his cue.\n\n\"But he was prehistoric,\" rejoined my lord.  \"A lot of blood has flowed\nunder the razor since the days of Sweet William.\"\n\n\"True; we have had Peace,\" said Parrington, and launched out into such\nglowing details of that criminal's last moments that I began to hope\nthe diversion might prove permanent.  But Lord Thornaby was not to be\ndenied.\n\n\"William and Charles are both dead monarchs,\" said he.  \"The reigning\nking in their department is the fellow who gutted poor Danby's place in\nBond Street.\"\n\nThere was a guilty silence on the part of the three conspirators--for I\nhad long since persuaded myself that Ernest was not in their\nsecret--and then my blood froze.\n\n\"I know him well,\" said Raffles, looking up.\n\nLord Thornaby stared at him in consternation.  The smile on the\nNapoleonic countenance of the barrister looked forced and frozen for\nthe first time during the evening.  Our author, who was nibbling cheese\nfrom a knife, left a bead of blood upon his beard.  The futile Ernest\nalone met the occasion with a hearty titter.\n\n\"What!\" cried my lord.  \"You know the thief?\"\n\n\"I wish I did,\" rejoined Raffles, chuckling.  \"No, Lord Thornaby, I\nonly meant the jeweller, Danby.  I go to him when I want a wedding\npresent.\"\n\nI heard three deep breaths drawn as one before I drew my own.\n\n\"Rather a coincidence,\" observed our host dryly, \"for I believe you\nalso know the Milchester people, where Lady Melrose had her necklace\nstolen a few months afterward.\"\n\n\"I was staying there at the time,\" said Raffles eagerly.  No snob was\never quicker to boast of basking in the smile of the great.\n\n\"We believe it to be the same man,\" said Lord Thornaby, speaking\napparently for the Criminologists' Club, and with much less severity of\nvoice.\n\n\"I only wish I could come across him,\" continued Raffles heartily.\n\"He's a criminal much more to my mind than your murderers who swear on\nthe drop or talk cricket in the condemned cell!\"\n\n\"He might be in the house now,\" said Lord Thornaby, looking Raffles in\nthe face.  But his manner was that of an actor in an unconvincing part\nand a mood to play it gamely to the bitter end; and he seemed\nembittered, as even a rich man may be in the moment of losing a bet.\n\n\"What a joke if he were!\" cried the Wild West writer.\n\n\"Absit omen!\" murmured Raffles, in better taste.\n\n\"Still, I think you'll find it's a favorite time,\" argued Kingsmill,\nQ.C.  \"And it would be quite in keeping with the character of this man,\nso far as it is known, to pay a little visit to the president of the\nCriminologists' Club, and to choose the evening on which he happens to\nbe entertaining the other members.\"\n\nThere was more conviction in this sally than in that of our noble host;\nbut this I attributed to the trained and skilled dissimulation of the\nbar.  Lord Thornaby, however, was not to be amused by the elaboration\nof his own idea, and it was with some asperity that he called upon the\nbutler, now solemnly superintending the removal of the cloth.\n\n\"Leggett!  Just send up-stairs to see if all the doors are open and the\nrooms in proper order.  That's an awful idea of yours, Kingsmill, or of\nmine!\" added my lord, recovering the courtesy of his order by an effort\nthat I could follow.  \"We should look fools.  I don't know which of us\nit was, by the way, who seduced the rest from the main stream of blood\ninto this burglarious backwater.  Are you familiar with De Quincey's\nmasterpiece on 'Murder as a Fine Art,' Mr. Raffles?\"\n\n\"I believe I once read it,\" replied Raffles doubtfully.\n\n\"You must read it again,\" pursued the earl.  \"It is the last word on a\ngreat subject; all we can hope to add is some baleful illustration or\nbloodstained footnote, not unworthy of De Quincey's text.  Well,\nLeggett?\"\n\nThe venerable butler stood wheezing at his elbow.  I had not hitherto\nobserved that the man was an asthmatic.\n\n\"I beg your lordship's pardon, but I think your lordship must have\nforgotten.\"\n\nThe voice came in rude gasps, but words of reproach could scarcely have\nachieved a finer delicacy.\n\n\"Forgotten, Leggett!  Forgotten what, may I ask?\"\n\n\"Locking your lordship's dressing-room door behind your lordship, my\nlord,\" stuttered the unfortunate Leggett, in the short spurts of a\nwinded man, a few stertorous syllables at a time.  \"Been up myself, my\nlord.  Bedroom door--dressing-room door--both locked inside!\"\n\nBut by this time the noble master was in worse case than the man. His\nfine forehead was a tangle of livid cords; his baggy jowl filled out\nlike a balloon.  In another second he had abandoned his place as our\nhost and fled the room; and in yet another we had forgotten ours as his\nguests and rushed headlong at his heels.\n\nRaffles was as excited as any of us now: he outstripped us all.  The\ncherubic little lawyer and I had a fine race for the last place but\none, which I secured, while the panting butler and his satellites\nbrought up a respectful rear.  It was our unconventional author,\nhowever, who was the first to volunteer his assistance and advice.\n\n\"No use pushing, Thornaby!\" cried he.  \"If it's been done with a wedge\nand gimlet, you may smash the door, but you'll never force it. Is there\na ladder in the place?\"\n\n\"There's a rope-ladder somewhere, in case of fire, I believe,\" said my\nlord vaguely, as he rolled a critical eye over our faces.  \"Where is it\nkept, Leggett?\"\n\n\"'William will fetch it, my lord.\"\n\nAnd a pair of noble calves went flashing to the upper regions.\n\n\"What's the good of bringing it down,\" cried Parrington, who had thrown\nback to the wilds in his excitement.  \"Let him hang it out of the\nwindow above your own, and let me climb down and do the rest!  I'll\nundertake to have one or other of these doors open in two twos!\"\n\nThe fastened doors were at right angles on the landing which we filled\nbetween us.  Lord Thornaby smiled grimly on the rest of us, when he had\nnodded and dismissed the author like a hound from the leash.\n\n\"It's a good thing we know something about our friend Parrington,\" said\nmy lord.  \"He takes more kindly to all this than I do, I can tell you.\"\n\n\"It's grist to his mill,\" said Raffles charitably.\n\n\"Exactly!  We shall have the whole thing in his next book.\"\n\n\"I hope to have it at the Old Bailey first,\" remarked Kingsmill, Q.C.\n\n\"Refreshing to find a man of letters such a man of action too!\"\n\nIt was Raffles who said this, and the remark seemed rather trite for\nhim, but in the tone there was a something that just caught my private\near.  And for once I understood: the officious attitude of Parrington,\nwithout being seriously suspicious in itself, was admirably calculated\nto put a previously suspected person in a grateful shade.  This\nliterary adventurer had elbowed Raffles out of the limelight, and\ngratitude for the service was what I had detected in Raffles's voice.\nNo need to say how grateful I felt myself.  But my gratitude was shot\nwith flashes of unwonted insight. Parrington was one of those who\nsuspected Raffles, or, at all events, one who was in the secret of\nthose suspicions.  What if he had traded on the suspect's presence in\nthe house?  What if he were a deep villain himself, and the villain of\nthis particular piece? I had made up my mind about him, and that in a\ntithe of the time I take to make it up as a rule, when we heard my man\nin the dressing-room.  He greeted us with an impudent shout; in a few\nmoments the door was open, and there stood Parrington, flushed and\ndishevelled, with a gimlet in one hand and a wedge in the other.\n\nWithin was a scene of eloquent disorder.  Drawers had been pulled out,\nand now stood on end, their contents heaped upon the carpet. Wardrobe\ndoors stood open; empty stud-cases strewed the floor; a clock, tied up\nin a towel, had been tossed into a chair at the last moment.  But a\nlong tin lid protruded from an open cupboard in one corner.  And one\nhad only to see Lord Thornaby's wry face behind the lid to guess that\nit was bent over a somewhat empty tin trunk.\n\n\"What a rum lot to steal!\" said he, with a twitch of humor at the\ncorners of his canine mouth.  \"My peer's robes, with coronet complete!\"\n\nWe rallied round him in a seemly silence.  I thought our scribe would\nput in his word.  But even he either feigned or felt a proper awe.\n\n\"You may say it was a rum place to keep 'em,\" continued Lord Thornaby.\n\"But where would you gentlemen stable your white elephants?  And these\nwere elephants as white as snow; by Jove, I'll job them for the future!\"\n\nAnd he made merrier over his loss than any of us could have imagined\nthe minute before; but the reason dawned on me a little later, when we\nall trooped down-stairs, leaving the police in possession of the\ntheatre of crime.  Lord Thornaby linked arms with Raffles as he led the\nway.  His step was lighter, his gayety no longer sardonic; his very\nlooks had improved.  And I divined the load that had been lifted from\nthe hospitable heart of our host.\n\n\"I only wish,\" said he, \"that this brought us any nearer to the\nidentity of the gentleman we were discussing at dinner, for, of course,\nwe owe it to all our instincts to assume that it was he.\"\n\n\"I wonder!\" said old Raffles, with a foolhardy glance at me.\n\n\"But I'm sure of it, my dear sir,\" cried my lord.  \"The audacity is his\nand his alone.  I look no further than the fact of his honoring me on\nthe one night of the year when I endeavor to entertain my brother\nCriminologists.  That's no coincidence, sir, but a deliberate irony,\nwhich would have occurred to no other criminal mind in England.\"\n\n\"You may be right,\" Raffles had the sense to say this time, though I\nflattered myself it was my face that made him.\n\n\"What is still more certain,\" resumed our host, \"is that no other\ncriminal in the world would have crowned so delicious a conception with\nso perfect an achievement.  I feel sure the inspector will agree with\nus.\"\n\nThe policeman in command had knocked and been admitted to the library\nas Lord Thornaby spoke.\n\n\"I didn't hear what you said, my lord.\"\n\n\"Merely that the perpetrator of this amusing outrage can be no other\nthan the swell mobsman who relieved Lady Melrose of her necklace and\npoor Danby of half his stock a year or two ago.\"\n\n\"I believe your lordship has hit the nail on the head.\"\n\n\"The man who took the Thimblely diamonds and returned them to Lord\nThimblely, you know.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he'll treat your lordship the same.\"\n\n\"Not he!  I don't mean to cry over my spilt milk.  I only wish the\nfellow joy of all he had time to take.  Anything fresh up-stain by the\nway?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord: the robbery took place between a quarter past eight and\nthe half-hour.\"\n\n\"How on earth do you know?\"\n\n\"The clock that was tied up in the towel had stopped at twenty past.\"\n\n\"Have you interviewed my man?\"\n\n\"I have, my lord.  He was in your lordship's room until close on the\nquarter, and all was as it should be when he left it.\"\n\n\"Then do you suppose the burglar was in hiding in the house?\"\n\n\"It's impossible to say, my lord.  He's not in the house now, for he\ncould only be in your lordship's bedroom or dressing-room, and we have\nsearched every inch of both.\"\n\nLord Thornaby turned to us when the inspector had retreated, caressing\nhis peaked cap.\n\n\"I told him to clear up these points first,\" he explained, jerking his\nhead toward the door.  \"I had reason to think my man had been\nneglecting his duties up there.  I am glad to find myself mistaken.\"\n\nI ought to have been no less glad to see my own mistake.  My suspicions\nof our officious author were thus proved to have been as wild as\nhimself.  I owed the man no grudge, and yet in my human heart I felt\nvaguely disappointed.  My theory had gained color from his behavior\never since he had admitted us to the dressing-room; it had changed all\nat once from the familiar to the morose; and only now was I just enough\nto remember that Lord Thornaby, having tolerated those familiarities as\nlong as they were connected with useful service, had administered a\nrelentless snub the moment that service had been well and truly\nperformed.\n\nBut if Parrington was exonerated in my mind, so also was Raffles\nreinstated in the regard of those who had entertained a far graver and\nmore dangerous hypothesis.  It was a miracle of good luck, a\ncoincidence among coincidences, which had white-washed him in their\nsight at the very moment when they were straining the expert eye to\nsift him through and through.  But the miracle had been performed, and\nits effect was visible in every face and audible in every voice. I\nexcept Ernest, who could never have been in the secret; moreover, that\ngay Criminologist had been palpably shaken by his first little\nexperience of crime.  But the other three vied among themselves to do\nhonor where they had done injustice.  I heard Kingsmill, Q.C., telling\nRaffles the best time to catch him at chambers, and promising a seat in\ncourt for any trial he might ever like to hear. Parrington spoke of a\npresentation set of his books, and in doing homage to Raffles made his\npeace with our host.  As for Lord Thornaby, I did overhear the name of\nthe Athenaeum Club, a reference to his friends on the committee, and a\nwhisper (as I thought) of Rule II.\n\nThe police were still in possession when we went our several ways, and\nit was all that I could do to drag Raffles up to my rooms, though, as I\nhave said, they were just round the corner.  He consented at last as a\nlesser evil than talking of the burglary in the street; and in my rooms\nI told him of his late danger and my own dilemma, of the few words I\nhad overheard in the beginning, of the thin ice on which he had cut\nfancy figures without a crack.  It was all very well for him.  He had\nnever realized his peril.  But let him think of me--listening,\nwatching, yet unable to lift a finger--unable to say one warning word.\n\nRaffles suffered me to finish, but a weary sigh followed the last\nsymmetrical whiff of a Sullivan which he flung into my fire before he\nspoke.\n\n\"No, I won't have another, thank you.  I'm going to talk to you, Bunny.\nDo you really suppose I didn't see through these wiseacres from the\nfirst?\"\n\nI flatly refused to believe he had done so before that evening.  Why\nhad he never mentioned his idea to me?  It had been quite the other\nway, as I indignantly reminded Raffles.  Did he mean me to believe he\nwas the man to thrust his head into the lion's mouth for fun? And what\npoint would there be in dragging me there to see the fun?\n\n\"I might have wanted you, Bunny.  I very nearly did.\"\n\n\"For my face?\"\n\n\"It has been my fortune before to-night, Bunny.  It has also given me\nmore confidence than you are likely to believe at this time of day.\nYou stimulate me more than you think.\"\n\n\"Your gallery and your prompter's box in one?\"\n\n\"Capital, Bunny!  But it was no joking matter with me either, my dear\nfellow; it was touch-and-go at the time.  I might have called on you at\nany moment, and it was something to know I should not have called in\nvain.\"\n\n\"But what to do, Raffles?\"\n\n\"Fight our way out and bolt!\" he answered, with a mouth that meant it,\nand a fine gay glitter of the eyes.\n\nI shot out of my chair.\n\n\"You don't mean to tell me you had a hand in the job?\"\n\n\"I had the only hand in it, my dear Bunny.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!  You were sitting at table at the time.  No, but you may\nhave taken some other fellow into the show.  I always thought you\nwould!\"\n\n\"One's quite enough, Bunny,\" said Raffles dryly; he leaned back in his\nchair and took out another cigarette.  And I accepted of yet another\nfrom his case; for it was no use losing one's temper with Raffles; and\nhis incredible statement was not, after all, to be ignored.\n\n\"Of course,\" I went on, \"if you really had brought off this thing on\nyour own, I should be the last to criticise your means of reaching such\nan end.  You have not only scored off a far superior force, which had\nlaid itself out to score off you, but you have put them in the wrong\nabout you, and they'll eat out of your hand for the rest of their days.\nBut don't ask me to believe that you've done all this alone!  By\nGeorge,\" I cried, in a sudden wave of enthusiasm, \"I don't care how\nyou've done it or who has helped you. It's the biggest thing you ever\ndid in your life!\"\n\nAnd certainly I had never seen Raffles look more radiant, or better\npleased with the world and himself, or nearer that elation which he\nusually left to me.\n\n\"Then you shall hear all about it, Bunny, if you'll do what I ask you.\"\n\n\"Ask away, old chap, and the thing's done.\"\n\n\"Switch off the electric lights.\"\n\n\"All of them?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"There, then.\"\n\n\"Now go to the back window and up with the blind.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I'm coming to you.  Splendid!  I never had a look so late as this.\nIt's the only window left alight in the house!\"\n\nHis cheek against the pane, he was pointing slightly downward and very\nmuch aslant through a long lane of mews to a little square light like a\nyellow tile at the end.  But I had opened the window and leaned out\nbefore I saw it for myself.\n\n\"You don't mean to say that's Thornaby House?\"\n\nI was not familiar with the view from my back windows.\n\n\"Of course I do, you rabbit!  Have a look through your own race-glass.\nIt has been the most useful thing of all.\"\n\nBut before I had the glass in focus more scales had fallen from my\neyes; and now I knew why I had seen so much of Raffles these last few\nweeks, and why he had always come between seven and eight o'clock in\nthe evening, and waited at this very window, with these very glasses at\nhis eyes.  I saw through them sharply now.  The one lighted window\npointed out by Raffles came tumbling into the dark circle of my vision.\nI could not see into the actual room, but the shadows of those within\nwere quite distinct on the lowered blind.  I even thought a black\nthread still dangled against the square of light.  It was, it must be,\nthe window to which the intrepid Parrington had descended from the one\nabove.\n\n\"Exactly!\" said Raffles in answer to my exclamation.  \"And that's the\nwindow I have been watching these last few weeks.  By daylight you can\nsee the whole lot above the ground floor on this side of the house; and\nby good luck one of them is the room in which the master of the house\narrays himself in all his nightly glory.  It was easily spotted by\nwatching at the right time.  I saw him shaved one morning before you\nwere up!  In the evening his valet stays behind to put things straight;\nand that has been the very mischief. In the end I had to find out\nsomething about the man, and wire to him from his girl to meet her\noutside at eight o'clock.  Of course he pretends he was at his post at\nthe time: that I foresaw, and did the poor fellow's work before my own.\nI folded and put away every garment before I permitted myself to rag\nthe room.\"\n\n\"I wonder you had time!\"\n\n\"It took me one more minute, and it put the clock on exactly fifteen.\nBy the way, I did that literally, of course, in the case of the clock\nthey found.  It's an old dodge, to stop a clock and alter the time; but\nyou must admit that it looked as though one had wrapped it up all ready\nto cart away.  There was thus any amount of prima-fade evidence of the\nrobbery having taken place when we were all at table.  As a matter of\nfact, Lord Thornaby left his dressing-room one minute, his valet\nfollowed him the minute after, and I entered the minute after that.\"\n\n\"Through the window?\"\n\n\"To be sure.  I was waiting below in the garden.  You have to pay for\nyour garden in town, in more ways than one.  You know the wall, of\ncourse, and that jolly old postern?  The lock was beneath contempt.\"\n\n\"But what about the window?  It's on the first floor, isn't it?\"\n\nRaffles took up the cane which he had laid down with his overcoat. It\nwas a stout bamboo with a polished ferule.  He unscrewed the ferule,\nand shook out of the cane a diminishing series of smaller canes,\nexactly like a child's fishing-rod, which I afterward found to have\nbeen their former state.  A double hook of steel was now produced and\nquickly attached to the tip of the top joint; then Raffles undid three\nbuttons of his waistcoat; and lapped round and round his waist was the\nfinest of Manila ropes, with the neatest of foot-loops at regular\nintervals.\n\n\"Is it necessary to go any further?\" asked Raffles when he had unwound\nthe rope.  \"This end is made fast to that end of the hook, the other\nhalf of the hook fits over anything that comes its way, and you leave\nyour rod dangling while you swarm up your line.  Of course, you must\nknow what you've got to hook on to; but a man who has had a porcelain\nbath fixed in his dressing-room is the man for me.  The pipes were all\noutside, and fixed to the wall in just the right place.  You see I had\nmade a reconnaissance by day in addition to many by night; it would\nhardly have been worth while constructing my ladder on chance.\"\n\n\"So you made it on purpose!\"\n\n\"My dear Bunny,\" said Raffles, as he wound the hemp girdle round his\nwaist once more, \"I never did care for ladder work, but I always said\nthat if I ever used a ladder it should be the best of its kind yet\ninvented.  This one may come in useful again.\"\n\n\"But how long did the whole thing take you?\"\n\n\"From mother earth, to mother earth?  About five minutes, to-night, and\none of those was spent in doing another man's work.\"\n\n\"What!\" I cried.  \"You mean to tell me you climbed up and down, in and\nout, and broke into that cupboard and that big tin box, and wedged up\nthe doors and cleared out with a peer's robes and all the rest of it in\nfive minutes?\"\n\n\"Of course I don't, and of course I didn't.\"\n\n\"Then what do you mean, and what did you do?\"\n\n\"Made two bites at the cherry, Bunny!  I had a dress rehearsal in the\ndead of last night, and it was then I took the swag.  Our noble friend\nwas snoring next door all the time, but the effort may still stand high\namong my small exploits, for I not only took all I wanted, but left the\nwhole place exactly as I found it, and shut things after me like a good\nlittle boy.  All that took a good deal longer; to-night I had simply to\nrag the room a bit, sweep up some studs and links, and leave ample\nevidence of having boned those rotten robes to-night.  That, if you\ncome to think of it, was what you writing chaps would call the\nquintessential Q.E.F.  I have not only shown these dear Criminologists\nthat I couldn't possibly have done this trick, but that there's some\nother fellow who could and did, and whom they've been perfect asses to\nconfuse with me.\"\n\nYou may figure me as gazing on Raffles all this time in mute and rapt\namazement.  But I had long been past that pitch.  If he had told me now\nthat he had broken into the Bank of England, or the Tower, I should not\nhave disbelieved him for a moment.  I was prepared to go home with him\nto the Albany and find the regalia under his bed.  And I took down my\novercoat as he put on his.  But Raffles would not hear of my\naccompanying him that night.\n\n\"No, my dear Bunny, I am short of sleep and fed up with excitement. You\nmayn't believe it--you may look upon me as a plaster devil--but those\nfive minutes you wot of were rather too crowded even for my taste.  The\ndinner was nominally at a quarter to eight, and I don't mind telling\nyou now that I counted on twice as long as I had. But no one came until\ntwelve minutes to, and so our host took his time.  I didn't want to be\nthe last to arrive, and I was in the drawing-room five minutes before\nthe hour.  But it was a quicker thing than I care about, when all is\nsaid.\"\n\nAnd his last word on the matter, as he nodded and went his way, may\nwell be mine; for one need be no criminologist, much less a member of\nthe Criminologists' Club, to remember what Raffles did with the robes\nand coronet of the Right Hon. the Earl of Thornaby, K.G.  He did with\nthem exactly what he might have been expected to do by the gentlemen\nwith whom he had foregathered; and he did it in a manner so\ncharacteristic of himself as surely to remove from their minds the last\naura of the idea that he and himself were the same person. Carter\nPaterson was out of the question, and any labelling or addressing to be\navoided on obvious grounds.  But Raffles stabled the white elephants in\nthe cloak-room at Charing Cross--and sent Lord Thornaby the ticket.\n\n\n\n\nThe Field of Phillipi\n\nNipper Nasmyth had been head of our school when Raffles was captain of\ncricket. I believe he owed his nickname entirely to the popular\nprejudice against a day-boy; and in view of the special reproach which\nthe term carried in my time, as also of the fact that his father was\none of the school trustees, partner in a banking firm of four\nresounding surnames, and manager of the local branch, there can be\nlittle doubt that the stigma was undeserved.  But we did not think so\nthen, for Nasmyth was unpopular with high and low, and appeared to\nglory in the fact.  A swollen conscience caused him to see and hear\neven more than was warranted by his position, and his uncompromising\nnature compelled him to act on whatsoever he heard or saw: a savage\ncustodian of public morals, he had in addition a perverse enthusiasm\nfor lost causes, loved a minority for its own sake, and untenable\ntenets for theirs.  Such, at all events, was my impression of Nipper\nNasmyth, after my first term, which was also his last I had never\nspoken to him, but I had heard him speak with extraordinary force and\nfervor in the school debates.  I carried a clear picture of his unkempt\nhair, his unbrushed coat, his dominant spectacles, his dogmatic jaw.\nAnd it was I who knew the combination at a glance, after years and\nyears, when the fateful whim seized Raffles to play once more in the\nOld Boys' Match, and his will took me down with him to participate in\nthe milder festivities of Founder's Day.\n\nIt was, however, no ordinary occasion.  The bicentenary loomed but a\nyear ahead, and a movement was on foot to mark the epoch with an\nadequate statue of our pious founder.  A special meeting was to be held\nat the school-house, and Raffles had been specially invited by the new\nhead master, a man of his own standing, who had been in the eleven with\nhim up at Cambridge.  Raffles had not been near the old place for\nyears; but I had never gone down since the day I left; and I will not\ndwell on the emotions which the once familiar journey awakened in my\nunworthy bosom.  Paddington was alive with Old Boys of all ages--but\nvery few of ours--if not as lively as we used to make it when we all\nlanded back for the holidays.  More of us had moustaches and cigarettes\nand \"loud\" ties.  That was all.  Yet of the throng, though two or three\nlooked twice and thrice at Raffles, neither he nor I knew a soul until\nwe had to change at the junction near our journey's end, when, as I\nsay, it was I who recognized Nipper Nasmyth at sight.\n\nThe man was own son of the boy we both remembered.  He had grown a\nragged beard and a moustache that hung about his face like a neglected\ncreeper.  He was stout and bent and older than his years. But he\nspurned the platform with a stamping stride which even I remembered in\nan instant, and which was enough for Raffles before he saw the man's\nface.\n\n\"The Nipper it is!\" he cried.  \"I could swear to that walk in a\npantomime procession!  See the independence in every step: that's his\nheel on the neck of the oppressor: it's the nonconformist conscience in\nbaggy breeches.  I must speak to him, Bunny.  There was a lot of good\nin the old Nipper, though he and I did bar each other.\"\n\nAnd in a moment he had accosted the man by the boy's nickname,\nobviously without thinking of an affront which few would have read in\nthat hearty open face and hand.\n\n\"My name's Nasmyth,\" snapped the other, standing upright to glare.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" said Raffles undeterred.  \"One remembers a nickname and\nforgets all it never used to mean.  Shake hands, my dear fellow! I'm\nRaffles.  It must be fifteen years since we met.\"\n\n\"At least,\" replied Nasmyth coldly; but he could no longer refuse\nRaffles his hand.  \"So you are going down,\" he sneered, \"to this great\ngathering?\"  And I stood listening at my distance, as though still in\nthe middle fourth.\n\n\"Rather!\" cried Raffles.  \"I'm afraid I have let myself lose touch, but\nI mean to turn over a new leaf.  I suppose that isn't necessary in your\ncase, Nasmyth?\"\n\nHe spoke with an enthusiasm rare indeed in him: it had grown upon\nRaffles in the train; the spirit of his boyhood had come rushing back\nat fifty miles an hour.  He might have been following some honorable\ncalling in town; he might have snatched this brief respite from a\ndistinguished but exacting career.  I am convinced that it was I alone\nwho remembered at that moment the life we were really leading at that\ntime.  With me there walked this skeleton through every waking hour\nthat was to follow.  I shall endeavor not to refer to it again.  Yet it\nshould not be forgotten that my skeleton was always there.\n\n\"It certainly is not necessary in my case,\" replied Nasmyth, still as\nstiff as any poker.  \"I happen to be a trustee.\"\n\n\"Of the school?\"\n\n\"Like my father before me.\"\n\n\"I congratulate you, my dear fellow!\" cried the hearty Raffles--a\nyounger Raffles than I had ever known in town.\n\n\"I don't know that you need,\" said Nasmyth sourly.\n\n\"But it must be a tremendous interest.  And the proof is that you're\ngoing down to this show, like all the rest of us.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not.  I live there, you see.\"\n\nAnd I think the Nipper recalled that name as he ground his heel upon an\nunresponsive flagstone.\n\n\"But you're going to this meeting at the school-house, surely?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  If I do there may be squalls.  I don't know what you\nthink about this precious scheme Raffles, but I...\"\n\nThe ragged beard stuck out, set teeth showed through the wild\nmoustache, and in a sudden outpouring we had his views.  They were\nnarrow and intemperate and perverse as any I had heard him advocate as\nthe firebrand of the Debating Society in my first term.  But they were\nstated with all the old vim and venom.  The mind of Nasmyth had not\nbroadened with the years, but neither had its natural force abated, nor\nthat of his character either.  He spoke with great vigor at the top of\nhis voice; soon we had a little crowd about us; but the tall collars\nand the broad smiles of the younger Old Boys did not deter our dowdy\ndemagogue.  Why spend money on a man who had been dead two hundred\nyears?  What good could it do him or the school?  Besides, he was only\ntechnically our founder.  He had not founded a great public school.  He\nhad founded a little country grammar school which had pottered along\nfor a century and a half.  The great public school was the growth of\nthe last fifty years, and no credit to the pillar of piety. Besides, he\nwas only nominally pious.  Nasmyth had made researches, and he knew.\nAnd why throw good money after a bad man?\n\n\"Are there many of your opinion?\" inquired Raffles, when the agitator\npaused for breath.  And Nasmyth beamed on us with flashing eyes.\n\n\"Not one to my knowledge as yet,\" said he.  \"But we shall see after\nto-morrow night.  I hear it's to be quite an exceptional gathering this\nyear; let us hope it may contain a few sane men.  There are none on the\npresent staff, and I only know of one among the trustees!\"\n\nRaffles refrained from smiling as his dancing eye met mine.\n\n\"I can understand your view,\" he said.  \"I am not sure that I don't\nshare it to some extent.  But it seems to me a duty to support a\ngeneral movement like this even if it doesn't take the direction or the\nshape of our own dreams.  I suppose you yourself will give something,\nNasmyth?\"\n\n\"Give something?  I?  Not a brass farthing!\" cried the implacable\nbanker.  \"To do so would be to stultify my whole position.  I cordially\nand conscientiously disapprove of the whole thing, and shall use all my\ninfluence against it.  No, my good sir, I not only don't subscribe\nmyself, but I hope to be the means of nipping a good many subscriptions\nin the bud.\"\n\nI was probably the only one who saw the sudden and yet subtle change in\nRaffles--the hard mouth, the harder eye.  I, at least, might have\nforeseen the sequel then and there.  But his quiet voice betrayed\nnothing, as he inquired whether Nasmyth was going to speak at next\nnight's meeting.  Nasmyth said he might, and certainly warned us what\nto expect.  He was still fulminating when our train came in.\n\n\"Then we meet again at Philippi,\" cried Raffles in gay adieu.  \"For you\nhave been very frank with us all, Nasmyth, and I'll be frank enough in\nmy turn to tell you that I've every intention of speaking on the other\nside!\"\n\nIt happened that Raffles had been asked to speak by his old college\nfriend, the new head master.  Yet it was not at the school-house that\nhe and I were to stay, but at the house that we had both been in as\nboys.  It also had changed hands: a wing had been added, and the double\ntier of tiny studies made brilliant with electric light. But the quad\nand the fives-courts did not look a day older; the ivy was no thicker\nround the study windows; and in one boy's castle we found the\ntraditional print of Charing Cross Bridge which had knocked about our\nstudies ever since a son of the contractor first sold it when he left.\nNay, more, there was the bald remnant of a stuffed bird which had been\nmy own daily care when it and I belonged to Raffles.  And when we all\nfiled in to prayers, through the green baize door which still separated\nthe master's part of the house from that of the boys, there was a small\nboy posted in the passage to give the sign of silence to the rest\nassembled in the hall, quite identically as in the dim old days; the\npicture was absolutely unchanged; it was only we who were out of it in\nbody and soul.\n\nOn our side of the baize door a fine hospitality and a finer flow of\nspirits were the order of the night.  There was a sound representative\nassortment of quite young Old Boys, to whom ours was a prehistoric\ntime, and in the trough of their modern chaff and chat we old stagers\nmight well have been left far astern of the fun.  Yet it was Raffles\nwho was the life and soul of the party, and that not by meretricious\nvirtue of his cricket.  There happened not to be another cricketer\namong us, and it was on their own subjects that Raffles laughed with\nthe lot in turn and in the lump.  I never knew him in quite such form.\nI will not say he was a boy among them, but he was that rarer being,\nthe man of the world who can enter absolutely into the fun and fervor\nof the salad age.  My cares and my regrets had never been more acute,\nbut Raffles seemed a man without either in his life.\n\nHe was not, however, the hero of the Old Boys' Match, and that was\nexpected of him by all the school.  There was a hush when he went in, a\ngroan when he came out.  I had no reason to suppose he was not trying;\nthese things happen to the cricketer who plays out of his class; but\nwhen the great Raffles went on to bowl, and was hit all over the field,\nI was not so sure.  It certainly failed to affect his spirits; he was\nmore brilliant than ever at our hospitable board; and after dinner came\nthe meeting at which he and Nasmyth were to speak.\n\nIt was a somewhat frigid gathering until Nasmyth rose.  We had all\ndined with our respective hosts, and then repaired to this business in\ncold blood.  Many were lukewarm about it in their hearts; there was a\ncertain amount of mild prejudice, and a greater amount of animal\nindifference, to be overcome in the opening speech.  It is not for me\nto say whether this was successfully accomplished.  I only know how the\ntemperature of that meeting rose with Nipper Nasmyth.\n\nAnd I dare say, in all the circumstances of the case, his really was a\nrather vulgar speech.  But it was certainly impassioned, and probably\nas purely instinctive as his denunciation of all the causes which\nappeal to the gullible many without imposing upon the cantankerous few.\nHis arguments, it is true, were merely an elaboration of those with\nwhich he had favored some of us already; but they were pointed by a\nconcise exposition of the several definite principles they represented,\nand barbed with a caustic rhetoric quite admirable in itself.  In a\nword, the manner was worthy of the very foundation it sought to shake,\nor we had never swallowed such matter without a murmur.  As it was,\nthere was a demonstration in the wilderness when the voice ceased\ncrying.  But we sat in the deeper silence when Raffles rose to reply.\n\nI leaned forward not to lose a word.  I knew my Raffles so well that I\nfelt almost capable of reporting his speech before I heard it.  Never\nwas I more mistaken, even in him!  So far from a gibe for a gibe and a\ntaunt for a taunt, there never was softer answer than that which A. J.\nRaffles returned to Nipper Nasmyth before the staring eyes and startled\nears of all assembled.  He courteously but firmly refused to believe a\nword his old friend Nasmyth had said--about himself.  He had known\nNasmyth for twenty years, and never had he met a dog who barked so loud\nand bit so little.  The fact was that he had far too kind a heart to\nbite at all.  Nasmyth might get up and protest as loud as he liked: the\nspeaker declared he knew him better than Nasmyth knew himself.  He had\nthe necessary defects of his great qualities.  He was only too good a\nsportsman.  He had a perfect passion for the weaker side.  That alone\nled Nasmyth into such excesses of language as we had all heard from his\nlips that night.  As for Raffles, he concluded his far too genial\nremarks by predicting that, whatever Nasmyth might say or think of the\nnew fund, he would subscribe to it as handsomely as any of us, like\n\"the generous good chap\" that we all knew him to be.\n\nEven so did Raffles disappoint the Old Boys in the evening as he had\ndisappointed the school by day.  We had looked to him for a noble\nraillery, a lofty and loyal disdain, and he had fobbed us off with\nfriendly personalities not even in impeccable taste. Nevertheless, this\nlight treatment of a grave offence went far to restore the natural\namenities of the occasion.  It was impossible even for Nasmyth to reply\nto it as he might to a more earnest onslaught.  He could but smile\nsardonically, and audibly undertake to prove Raffles a false prophet;\nand though subsequent speakers were less merciful the note was struck,\nand there was no more bad blood in the debate.  There was plenty,\nhowever, in the veins of Nasmyth, as I was to discover for myself\nbefore the night was out.\n\nYou might think that in the circumstances he would not have attended\nthe head master's ball with which the evening ended; but that would be\nsadly to misjudge so perverse a creature as the notorious Nipper. He\nwas probably one of those who protest that there is \"nothing personal\"\nin their most personal attacks.  Not that Nasmyth took this tone about\nRaffles when he and I found ourselves cheek by jowl against the\nballroom wall; he could forgive his franker critics, but not the\nfriendly enemy who had treated him so much more gently than he deserved.\n\n\"I seem to have seen you with this great man Raffles,\" began Nasmyth,\nas he overhauled me with his fighting eye.  \"Do you know him well?\"\n\n\"Intimately.\"\n\n\"I remember now.  You were with him when he forced himself upon me on\nthe way down yesterday.  He had to tell me who he was.  Yet he talks as\nthough we were old friends.\"\n\n\"You were in the upper sixth together,\" I rejoined, nettled by his tone.\n\n\"What does that matter?  I am glad to say I had too much self-respect,\nand too little respect for Raffles, ever to be a friend of his then. I\nknew too many of the things he did,\" said Nipper Nasmyth.\n\nHis fluent insults had taken my breath.  But in a lucky flash I saw my\nretort.\n\n\"You must have had special opportunities of observation, living in the\ntown,\" said I; and drew first blood between the long hair and the\nragged beard; but that was all.\n\n\"So he really did get out at nights?\" remarked my adversary.  \"You\ncertainly give your friend away.  What's he doing now?\"\n\nI let my eyes follow Raffles round the room before replying.  He was\nwaltzing with a master's wife--waltzing as he did everything else.\nOther couples seemed to melt before them.  And the woman on his arm\nlooked a radiant girl.\n\n\n\"I meant in town, or wherever he lives his mysterious life,\" explained\nNasmyth, when I told him that he could see for himself. But his clever\ntone did not trouble me; it was his epithet that caused me to prick my\nears.  And I found some difficulty in following Raffles right round the\nroom.\n\n\"I thought everybody knew what he was doing; he's playing cricket most\nof his time,\" was my measured reply; and if it bore an extra touch of\ninsolence, I can honestly ascribe that to my nerves.\n\n\"And is that all he does for a living?\" pursued my inquisitor keenly.\n\n\"You had better ask Raffles himself,\" said I to that.  \"It's a pity you\ndidn't ask him in public, at the meeting!\"\n\nBut I was beginning to show temper in my embarrassment, and of course\nthat made Nasmyth the more imperturbable.\n\n\"Really, he might be following some disgraceful calling, by the mystery\nyou make of it!\" he exclaimed.  \"And for that matter I call first-class\ncricket a disgraceful calling, when it's followed by men who ought to\nbe gentlemen, but are really professionals in gentlemanly clothing.\nThe present craze for gladiatorial athleticism I regard as one of the\ngreat evils of the age; but the thinly veiled professionalism of the\nso-called amateur is the greatest evil of that craze.  Men play for the\ngentlemen and are paid more than the players who walk out of another\ngate.  In my time there was none of that.  Amateurs were amateurs and\nsport was sport; there were no Raffleses in first-class cricket then.\nI had forgotten Raffles was a modern first-class cricketer: that\nexplains him.  Rather than see my son such another, do you know what\nI'd prefer to see him?\"\n\nI neither knew nor cared: yet a wretched premonitory fascination held\nme breathless till I was told.\n\n\"I'd prefer to see him a thief!\" said Nasmyth savagely; and when his\neyes were done with me, he turned upon his heel.  So that ended that\nstage of my discomfiture.\n\nIt was only to give place to a worse.  Was all this accident or fell\ndesign?  Conscience had made a coward of me, and yet what reason had I\nto disbelieve the worst?  We were pirouetting on the edge of an abyss;\nsooner or later the false step must come and the pit swallow us.  I\nbegan to wish myself back in London, and I did get back to my room in\nour old house.  My dancing days were already over; there I had taken\nthe one resolution to which I remained as true as better men to better\nvows; there the painful association was no mere sense of personal\nunworthiness.  I fell to thinking in my room of other dances ... and\nwas still smoking the cigarette which Raffles had taught me to\nappreciate when I looked up to find him regarding me from the door.  He\nhad opened it as noiselessly as only Raffles could open doors, and now\nhe closed it in the same professional fashion.\n\n\"I missed Achilles hours ago,\" said he.  \"And still he's sulking in his\ntent!\"\n\n\"I have been,\" I answered, laughing as he could always make me, \"but\nI'll chuck it if you'll stop and smoke.  Our host doesn't mind; there's\nan ash-tray provided for the purpose.  I ought to be sulking between\nthe sheets, but I'm ready to sit up with you till morning.\"\n\n\"We might do worse; but, on the other hand, we might do still better,\"\nrejoined Raffles, and for once he resisted the seductive Sullivan.  \"As\na matter of fact, it's morning now; in another hour it will be dawn;\nand where could day dawn better than in Warfield Woods, or along the\nStockley road, or even on the Upper or the Middle?  I don't want to\nturn in, any more than you do.  I may as well confess that the whole\nshow down here has exalted me more than anything for years.  But if we\ncan't sleep, Bunny, let's have some fresh air instead.\"\n\n\"Has everybody gone to bed?\" I asked.\n\n\"Long ago.  I was the last in.  Why?\"\n\n\"Only it might sound a little odd, our turning out again, if they were\nto hear us.\"\n\nRaffles stood over me with a smile made of mischief and cunning; but it\nwas the purest mischief imaginable, the most innocent and comic cunning.\n\n\"They shan't hear us at all, Bunny,\" said he.  \"I mean to get out as I\ndid in the good old nights.  I've been spoiling for the chance ever\nsince I came down.  There's not the smallest harm in it now; and if\nyou'll come with me I'll show you how it used to be done.\"\n\n\"But I know,\" said I.  \"Who used to haul up the rope after you, and let\nit down again to the minute?\"\n\nRaffles looked down on me from lowered lids, over a smile too humorous\nto offend.\n\n\"My dear good Bunny!  And do you suppose that even then I had only one\nway of doing a thing?  I've had a spare loophole all my life, and when\nyou're ready I'll show you what it was when I was here. Take off those\nboots, and carry your tennis-shoes; slip on another coat; put out your\nlight; and I'll meet you on the landing in two minutes.\"\n\nHe met me with uplifted finger, and not a syllable; and down-stairs he\nled me, stocking soles close against the skirting, two feet to each\nparticular step.  It must have seemed child's play to Raffles; the old\nprecautions were obviously assumed for my entertainment; but I confess\nthat to me it was all refreshingly exciting--for once without a risk of\ndurance if we came to grief!  With scarcely a creak we reached the\nhall, and could have walked out of the street door without danger or\ndifficulty.  But that would not do for Raffles.  He must needs lead me\ninto the boys' part, through the green baize door.  It took a deal of\nopening and shutting, but Raffles seemed to enjoy nothing better than\nthese mock obstacles, and in a few minutes we were resting with sharp\nears in the boys' hall.\n\n\"Through these windows?\" I whispered, when the clock over the piano had\nhad matters its own way long enough to make our minds quite easy.\n\n\"How else?\" whispered Raffles, as he opened the one on whose ledge our\nletters used to await us of a morning.\n\n\"And then through the quad--\"\n\n\"And over the gates at the end.  No talking, Bunny; there's a dormitory\njust overhead; but ours was in front, you remember, and if they had\never seen me I should have nipped back this way while they were\nwatching the other.\"\n\nHis finger was on his lips as we got out softly into the starlight. I\nremember how the gravel hurt as we left the smooth flagged margin of\nthe house for the open quad; but the nearer of two long green seats\n(whereon you prepared your construe for the second-school in the summer\nterm) was mercifully handy; and once in our rubber soles we had no\ndifficulty in scaling the gates beyond the fives-courts. Moreover, we\ndropped into a very desert of a country road, nor saw a soul when we\ndoubled back beneath the outer study windows, nor heard a footfall in\nthe main street of the slumbering town.  Our own fell like the\nnight-dews and the petals of the poet; but Raffles ran his arm through\nmine, and would chatter in whispers as we went.\n\n\"So you and Nipper had a word--or was it words?  I saw you out of the\ntail of my eye when I was dancing, and I heard you out of the tail of\nmy ear.  It sounded like words, Bunny, and I thought I caught my name.\nHe's the most consistent man I know, and the least altered from a boy.\nBut he'll subscribe all right, you'll see, and be very glad I made him.\"\n\nI whispered back that I did not believe it for a moment.  Raffles had\nnot heard all Nasmyth had said of him.  And neither would he listen to\nthe little I meant to repeat to him; he would but reiterate a\nconviction so chimerical to my mind that I interrupted in my turn to\nask him what ground he had for it.\n\n\"I've told you already,\" said Raffles.  \"I mean to make him.\"\n\n\"But how?\" I asked.  \"And when, and where?\"\n\n\"At Philippi, Bunny, where I said I'd see him.  What a rabbit you are\nat a quotation!\n\n  \"'And I think that the field of Philippi\n     Was where Caesar came to an end;\n       But who gave old Brutus the tip, I\n          Can't comprehend!'\n\n\"You may have forgotten your Shakespeare, Bunny, but you ought to\nremember that.\"\n\nAnd I did, vaguely, but had no idea what it or Raffles meant, as I\nplainly told him.\n\n\"The theatre of war,\" he answered--\"and here we are at the stage door!\"\n\nRaffles had stopped suddenly in his walk.  It was the last dark hour of\nthe summer night, but the light from a neighboring lamppost showed me\nthe look on his face as he turned.\n\n\"I think you also inquired when,\" he continued.  \"Well, then, this\nminute--if you will give me a leg up!\"\n\nAnd behind him, scarcely higher than his head, and not even barred, was\na wide window with a wire blind, and the name of Nasmyth among others\nlettered in gold upon the wire.\n\n\"You're never going to break in?\"\n\n\"This instant, if you'll, help me; in five or ten minutes, if you\nwon't.\"\n\n\"Surely you didn't bring the--the tools?\"\n\nHe jingled them gently in his pocket.\n\n\"Not the whole outfit, Bunny.  But you never know when you mayn't want\none or two.  I'm only thankful I didn't leave the lot behind this time.\nI very nearly did.\"\n\n\"I must say I thought you would, coming down here,\" I said\nreproachfully.\n\n\"But you ought to be glad I didn't,\" he rejoined with a smile. \"It's\ngoing to mean old Nasmyth's subscription to the Founder's Fund, and\nthat's to be a big one, I promise you!  The lucky thing is that I went\nso far as to bring my bunch of safekeys.  Now, are you going to help me\nuse them, or are you not?  If so, now's your minute; if not, clear out\nand be--\"\n\n\"Not so fast, Raffles,\" said I testily.  \"You must have planned this\nbefore you came down, or you would never have brought all those things\nwith you.\"\n\n\"My dear Bunny, they're a part of my kit!  I take them wherever I take\nmy evening-clothes.  As to this potty bank, I never even thought of it,\nmuch less that it would become a public duty to draw a hundred or so\nwithout signing for it.  That's all I shall touch, Bunny--I'm not on\nthe make to-night.  There's no risk in it either.  If I am caught I\nshall simply sham champagne and stand the racket; it would be an\nobvious frolic after what happened at that meeting.  And they will\ncatch me, if I stand talking here: you run away back to bed--unless\nyou're quite determined to 'give old Brutus the tip!'\"\n\nNow we had barely been a minute whispering where we stood, and the\nwhole street was still as silent as the tomb.  To me there seemed least\ndanger in discussing the matter quietly on the spot.  But even as he\ngave me my dismissal Raffles turned and caught the sill above him,\nfirst with one hand and then with the other.  His legs swung like a\npendulum as he drew himself up with one arm, then shifted the position\nof the other hand, and very gradually worked himself waist-high with\nthe sill.  But the sill was too narrow for him; that was as far as he\ncould get unaided; and it was as much as I could bear to see of a feat\nwhich in itself might have hardened my conscience and softened my\nheart.  But I had identified his doggerel verse at last.  I am ashamed\nto say that it was part of a set of my very own writing in the school\nmagazine of my time.  So Raffles knew the stuff better than I did\nmyself, and yet scorned to press his flattery to win me over!  He had\nwon me: in a second my rounded shoulders were a pedestal for those\ndangling feet.  And before many more I heard the old metallic snap,\nfollowed by the raising of a sash so slowly and gently as to be almost\ninaudible to me listening just below.\n\nRaffles went through hands first, disappeared for an instant, then\nleaned out, lowering his hands for me.\n\n\"Come on, Bunny!  You're safer in than out.  Hang on to the sill and\nlet me get you under the arms.  Now all together--quietly does it--and\nover you come!\"\n\nNo need to dwell on our proceedings in the bank.  I myself had small\npart in the scene, being posted rather in the wings, at the foot of the\nstairs leading to the private premises in which the manager had his\ndomestic being.  But I made my mind easy about him, for in the silence\nof my watch I soon detected a nasal note overhead, and it was resonant\nand aggressive as the man himself.  Of Raffles, on the contrary, I\nheard nothing, for he had shut the door between us, and I was to warn\nhim if a single sound came through.  I need scarcely add that no\nwarning was necessary during the twenty minutes we remained in the\nbank.  Raffles afterward assured me that nineteen of them had been\nspent in filing one key; but one of his latest inventions was a little\nthick velvet bag in which he carried the keys; and this bag had two\nelastic mouths, which closed so tightly about either wrist that he\ncould file away, inside, and scarcely hear it himself.  As for these\nkeys, they were clever counterfeits of typical patterns by two great\nsafe-making firms.  And Raffles had come by them in a manner all his\nown, which the criminal world may discover for itself.\n\nWhen he opened the door and beckoned to me, I knew by his face that he\nhad succeeded to his satisfaction, and by experience better than to\nquestion him on the point.  Indeed, the first thing was to get out of\nthe bank; for the stars were drowning in a sky of ink and water, and it\nwas a comfort to feel that we could fly straight to our beds.  I said\nso in whispers as Raffles cautiously opened our window and peeped out.\nIn an instant his head was in, and for another I feared the worst.\n\n\"What was that, Bunny?  No, you don't, my son!  There's not a soul in\nsight that I can see, but you never know, and we may as well lay a\nscent while we're about it.  Ready?  Then follow me, and never mind the\nwindow.\"\n\nWith that he dropped softly into the street, and I after him, turning\nto the right instead of the left, and that at a brisk trot instead of\nthe innocent walk which had brought us to the bank. Like mice we\nscampered past the great schoolroom, with its gable snipping a paler\nsky than ever, and the shadows melting even in the colonnade\nunderneath.  Masters' houses flitted by on the left, lesser landmarks\non either side, and presently we were running our heads into the dawn,\none under either hedge of the Stockley road.\n\n\"Did you see that light in Nab's just now?\" cried Raffles as he led.\n\n\"No; why?\" I panted, nearly spent.\n\n\"It was in Nab's dressing-room.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I've seen it there before,\" continued Raffles.  \"He never was a good\nsleeper, and his ears reach to the street.  I wouldn't like to say how\noften I was chased by him in the small hours!  I believe he knew who it\nwas toward the end, but Nab was not the man to accuse you of what he\ncouldn't prove.\"\n\nI had no breath for comment.  And on sped Raffles like a yacht before\nthe wind, and on I blundered like a wherry at sea, making heavy weather\nall the way, and nearer foundering at every stride. Suddenly, to my\ndeep relief, Raffles halted, but only to tell me to stop my pipes while\nhe listened.\n\n\"It's all right, Bunny,\" he resumed, showing me a glowing face in the\ndawn.  \"History's on its own tracks once more, and I'll bet you it's\ndear old Nab on ours!  Come on, Bunny; run to the last gasp, and leave\nthe rest to me.\"\n\nI was past arguing, and away he went.  There was no help for it but to\nfollow as best I could.  Yet I had vastly preferred to collapse on the\nspot, and trust to Raffles's resource, as before very long I must.  I\nhad never enjoyed long wind and the hours that we kept in town may well\nhave aggravated the deficiency.  Raffles, however, was in first-class\ntraining from first-class cricket, and he had no mercy on Nab or me.\nBut the master himself was an old Oxford miler, who could still bear it\nbetter than I; nay, as I flagged and stumbled, I heard him pounding\nsteadily behind.\n\n\"Come on, come on, or he'll do us!\" cried Raffles shrilly over his\nshoulder; and a gruff sardonic laugh came back over mine.  It was\npearly morning now, but we had run into a shallow mist that took me by\nthe throat and stabbed me to the lungs.  I coughed and coughed, and\nstumbled in my stride, until down I went, less by accident than to get\nit over, and so lay headlong in my tracks.  And old Nab dealt me a\nverbal kick as he passed.\n\n\"You beast!\" he growled, as I have known him growl it in form.\n\nBut Raffles himself had abandoned the flight on hearing my downfall,\nand I was on hands and knees just in time to see the meeting between\nhim and old Nab.  And there stood Raffles in the silvery mist, laughing\nwith his whole light heart, leaning back to get the full flavor of his\nmirth; and, nearer me, sturdy old Nab, dour and grim, with beads of dew\non the hoary beard that had been lamp-black in our time.\n\n\"So I've caught you at last!\" said he.  \"After more years than I mean\nto count!\"\n\n\"Then you're luckier than we are, sir,\" answered Raffles, \"for I fear\nour man has given us the slip.\"\n\n\"Your man!\" echoed Nab.  His bushy eyebrows had shot up: it was as much\nas I could do to keep my own in their place.\n\n\"We were indulging in the chase ourselves,\" explained Raffles, \"and one\nof us has suffered for his zeal, as you can see.  It is even possible\nthat we, too, have been chasing a perfectly innocent man.\"\n\n\"Not to say a reformed character,\" said our pursuer dryly. \"I suppose\nyou don't mean a member of the school?\" he added, pinking his man\nsuddenly as of yore, with all the old barbed acumen.  But Raffles was\nnow his match.\n\n\"That would be carrying reformation rather far, sir.  No, as I say, I\nmay have been mistaken in the first instance; but I had put out my\nlight and was looking out of the window when I saw a fellow behaving\nquite suspiciously.  He was carrying his boots and creeping along in\nhis socks--which must be why you never heard him, sir. They make less\nnoise than rubber soles even--that is, they must, you know!  Well,\nBunny had just left me, so I hauled him out and we both crept down to\nplay detective.  No sign of the fellow!  We had a look in the\ncolonnade--I thought I heard him--and that gave us no end of a hunt for\nnothing.  But just as we were leaving he came padding past under our\nnoses, and that's where we took up the chase.  Where he'd been in the\nmeantime I have no idea; very likely he'd done no harm; but it seemed\nworth while finding out.  He had too good a start, though, and poor\nBunny had too bad a wind.\"\n\n\"You should have gone on and let me rip,\" said I, climbing to my feet\nat last.\n\n\"As it is, however, we will all let the other fellow do so,\" said old\nNab in a genial growl.  \"And you two had better turn into my house and\nhave something to keep the morning cold out.\"\n\nYou may imagine with what alacrity we complied; and yet I am bound to\nconfess that I had never liked Nab at school.  I still remember my term\nin his form.  He had a caustic tongue and  fine assortment of damaging\nepithets, most of which were levelled at my devoted skull during those\nthree months.  I now discovered that he also kept a particularly mellow\nScotch whiskey, an excellent cigar, and a fund of anecdote of which a\nmordant wit was the worthy bursar. Enough to add that he kept us\nlaughing in his study until the chapel bells rang him out.\n\nAs for Raffles, he appeared to me to feel far more compunction for the\nfable which he had been compelled to foist upon one of the old masters\nthan for the immeasurably graver offence against society and another\nOld Boy.  This, indeed, did not worry him at all; and the story was\nreceived next day with absolute credulity on all sides.  Nasmyth\nhimself was the first to thank us both for our spirited effort on his\nbehalf; and the incident had the ironic effect of establishing an\nimmediate entente cordiale between Raffles and his very latest victim.\nI must confess, however, that for my own part I was thoroughly uneasy\nduring the Old Boys' second innings, when Raffles made a selfish score,\ninstead of standing by me to tell his own story in his own way.  There\nwas never any knowing with what new detail he was about to embellish\nit: and I have still to receive full credit for the tact that it\nrequired to follow his erratic lead convincingly.  Seldom have I been\nmore thankful than when our train started next morning, and the poor,\nunsuspecting Nasmyth himself waved us a last farewell from the platform.\n\n\"Lucky we weren't staying at Nab's,\" said Raffles, as he lit a Sullivan\nand opened his Daily Mail at its report of the robbery. \"There was one\nthing Nab would have spotted like the downy old bird he always was and\nwill be.\"\n\n\"What was that?\"\n\n\"The front door must have been found duly barred and bolted in the\nmorning, and yet we let them assume that we came out that way.  Nab\nwould have pounced on the point, and by this time we might have been\nnabbed ourselves.\"\n\nIt was but a little over a hundred sovereigns that Raffles had taken,\nand, of course, he had resolutely eschewed any and every form of paper\nmoney.  He posted his own first contribution of twenty-five pounds to\nthe Founder's Fund immediately on our return to town, before rushing\noff to more first-class cricket, and I gathered that the rest would\nfollow piecemeal as he deemed it safe. By an odd coincidence, however,\na mysterious but magnificent donation of a hundred guineas was almost\nsimultaneously received in notes by the treasurer of the Founder's\nFund, from one who simply signed himself \"Old Boy.\"  The treasurer\nhappened to be our late host, the new man at our old house, and he\nwrote to congratulate Raffles on what he was pleased to consider a\ndirect result of the latter's speech.  I did not see the letter that\nRaffles wrote in reply, but in due course I heard the name of the\nmysterious contributor.  He was said to be no other than Nipper Nasmyth\nhimself. I asked Raffles if it was true.  He replied that he would ask\nold Nipper point-blank if he came up as usual to the Varsity match, and\nif they had the luck to meet.  And not only did this happen, but I had\nthe greater luck to be walking round the ground with Raffles when we\nencountered our shabby friend in front of the pavilion.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" cried Raffles, \"I hear it was you who gave that\nhundred guineas by stealth to the very movement you denounced. Don't\ndeny it, and don't blush to find it fame.  Listen to me. There was a\ngreat lot in what you said; but it's the kind of thing we ought all to\nback, whether we strictly approve of it in our hearts or not.\"\n\n\"Exactly, Raffles, but the fact is--\"\n\n\"I know what you're going to say.  Don't say it.  There's not one in a\nthousand who would do as you've done, and not one in a million who\nwould do it anonymously.\"\n\n\"But what makes you think I did it, Raffles?\"\n\n\"Everybody is saying so.  You will find it all over the place when you\nget back.  You will find yourself the most popular man down there,\nNasmyth!\"\n\nI never saw a nobler embarrassment than that of this awkward, ungainly,\ncantankerous man: all his angles seemed to have been smoothed away:\nthere was something quite human in the flushed, undecided, wistful face.\n\n\"I never was popular in my life,\" he said.  \"I don't want to buy my\npopularity now.  To be perfectly candid with you, Raffles--\"\n\n\"Don't!  I can't stop to hear.  They're ringing the bell.  But you\nshouldn't have been angry with me for saying you were a generous good\nchap, Nasmyth, when you were one all the time.  Good-by, old fellow!\"\n\nBut Nasmyth detained us a second more.  His hesitation was at an end.\nThere was a sudden new light in his face.\n\n\"Was I?\" he cried.  \"Then I'll make it two hundred, and damn the odds!\"\n\nRaffles was a thoughtful man as we went to our seats.  He saw nobody,\nwould acknowledge no remark.  Neither did he attend to the cricket for\nthe first half-hour after lunch; instead, he eventually invited me to\ncome for a stroll on the practice ground, where, however, we found two\nchairs aloof from the fascinating throng.\n\n\"I am not often sorry, Bunny, as you know,\" he began.  \"But I have been\nsorry since the interval.  I've been sorry for poor old Nipper Nasmyth.\nDid you see the idea of being popular dawn upon him for the first time\nin his life?\"\n\n\"I did; but you had nothing to do with that, my dear man.\"\n\nRaffles shook his head over me as our eyes met.  \"I had everything to\ndo with it.  I tried to make him tell the meanest lie.  I made sure he\nwould, and for that matter he nearly did.  Then, at the last moment, he\nsaw how to hedge things with his conscience.  And his second hundred\nwill be a real gift.\"\n\n\"You mean under his own name--\"\n\n\"And with his own free-will.  My good Bunny, is it possible you don't\nknow what I did with the hundred we drew from that bank!\"\n\n\"I knew what you were going to do with it,\" said I.  \"I didn't know you\nhad actually got further than the twenty-five you told me you were\nsending as your own contribution.\"\n\nRaffles rose abruptly from his chair.\n\n\"And you actually thought that came out of his money?\"\n\n\"Naturally.\"\n\n\"In my name?\"\n\n\"I thought so.\"\n\nRaffles stared at me inscrutably for some moments, and for some more at\nthe great white numbers over the grand-stand.\n\n\"We may as well have another look at the cricket,\" said he.  \"It's\ndifficult to see the board from here, but I believe there's another man\nout.\"\n\n\n\n\nA Bad Night\n\nThere was to be a certain little wedding in which Raffles and I took a\nsurreptitious interest.  The bride-elect was living in some retirement,\nwith a recently widowed mother and an asthmatical brother, in a mellow\nhermitage on the banks of the Mole.  The bridegroom was a prosperous\nson of the same suburban soil which had nourished both families for\ngenerations.  The wedding presents were so numerous as to fill several\nrooms at the pretty retreat upon the Mole, and of an intrinsic value\ncalling for a special transaction with the Burglary Insurance Company\nin Cheapside.  I cannot say how Raffles obtained all this information.\nI only know that it proved correct in each particular.  I was not\nindeed deeply interested before the event, since Raffles assured me\nthat it was \"a one-man job,\" and naturally intended to be the one man\nhimself. It was only at the eleventh hour that our positions were\ninverted by the wholly unexpected selection of Raffles for the English\nteam in the Second Test Match.\n\nIn a flash I saw the chance of my criminal career.  It was some years\nsince Raffles had served his country in these encounters; he had never\nthought to be called upon again, and his gratification was only less\nthan his embarrassment.  The match was at Old Trafford, on the third\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday in July; the other affair had been all\narranged for the Thursday night, the night of the wedding at East\nMolesey.  It was for Raffles to choose between the two excitements, and\nfor once I helped him to make up his mind.  I duly pointed out to him\nthat in Surrey, at all events, I was quite capable of taking his place.\nNay, more, I insisted at once on my prescriptive right and on his\npatriotic obligation in the matter.  In the country's name and in my\nown, I implored him to give it and me a chance; and for once, as I say,\nmy arguments prevailed.  Raffles sent his telegram--it was the day\nbefore the match.  We then rushed down to Esher, and over every inch of\nthe ground by that characteristically circuitous route which he\nenjoined on me for the next night.  And at six in the evening I was\nreceiving the last of my many instructions through a window of the\nrestaurant car.\n\n\"Only promise me not to take a revolver,\" said Raffles in a whisper.\n\"Here are my keys; there's an old life-preserver somewhere in the\nbureau; take that, if you like--though what you take I rather fear you\nare the chap to use!\"\n\n\"Then the rope be round my own neck!\" I whispered back.  \"Whatever else\nI may do, Raffles, I shan't give you away; and you'll find I do better\nthan you think, and am worth trusting with a little more to do, or I'll\nknow the reason why!\"\n\nAnd I meant to know it, as he was borne out of Euston with raised\neyebrows, and I turned grimly on my heel.  I saw his fears for me; and\nnothing could have made me more fearless for myself.  Raffles had been\nwrong about me all these years; now was my chance to set him right.  It\nwas galling to feel that he had no confidence in my coolness or my\nnerve, when neither had ever failed him at a pinch. I had been loyal to\nhim through rough and smooth.  In many an ugly corner I had stood as\nfirm as Raffles himself.  I was his right hand, and yet he never\nhesitated to make me his catspaw.  This time, at all events, I should\nbe neither one nor the other; this time I was the understudy playing\nlead at last; and I wish I could think that Raffles ever realized with\nwhat gusto I threw myself into his part.\n\nThus I was first out of a crowded theatre train at Esher next night,\nand first down the stairs into the open air.  The night was close and\ncloudy; and the road to Hampton Court, even now that the suburban\nbuilder has marked much of it for his own, is one of the darkest I\nknow.  The first mile is still a narrow avenue, a mere tunnel of leaves\nat midsummer; but at that time there was not a lighted pane or cranny\nby the way.  Naturally, it was in this blind reach that I fancied I was\nbeing followed.  I stopped in my stride; so did the steps I made sure I\nhad heard not far behind; and when I went on, they followed suit.  I\ndried my forehead as I walked, but soon brought myself to repeat the\nexperiment when an exact repetition of the result went to convince me\nthat it had been my own echo all the time.  And since I lost it on\ngetting quit of the avenue, and coming out upon the straight and open\nroad, I was not long in recovering from my scare.  But now I could see\nmy way, and found the rest of it without mishap, though not without\nanother semblance of adventure. Over the bridge across the Mole, when\nabout to turn to the left, I marched straight upon a policeman in\nrubber soles.  I had to call him \"officer\" as I passed, and to pass my\nturning by a couple of hundred yards, before venturing back another way.\n\nAt last I had crept through a garden gate, and round by black windows\nto a black lawn drenched with dew.  It had been a heating walk, and I\nwas glad to blunder on a garden seat, most considerately placed under a\ncedar which added its own darkness to that of the night.  Here I rested\na few minutes, putting up my feet to keep them dry, untying my shoes to\nsave time, and generally facing the task before me with a coolness\nwhich I strove to make worthy of my absent chief.  But mine was a\nself-conscious quality, as far removed from the original as any other\ndeliberate imitation of genius.  I actually struck a match on my\ntrousers, and lit one of the shorter Sullivans.  Raffles himself would\nnot have done such a thing at such a moment.  But I wished to tell him\nthat I had done it; and in truth I was not more than pleasurably\nafraid; I had rather that impersonal curiosity as to the issue which\nhas been the saving of me in still more precarious situations.  I even\ngrew impatient for the fray, and could not after all sit still as long\nas I had intended.  So it happened that I was finishing my cigarette on\nthe edge of the wet lawn, and about to slip off my shoes before\nstepping across the gravel to the conservatory door, when a most\nsingular sound arrested me in the act.  It was a muffled gasping\nsomewhere overhead.  I stood like stone; and my listening attitude must\nhave been visible against the milky sheen of the lawn, for a labored\nvoice hailed me sternly from a window.\n\n\"Who on earth are you?\" it wheezed.\n\n\"A detective officer,\" I replied, \"sent down by the Burglary Insurance\nCompany.\"\n\nNot a moment had I paused for my precious fable.  It had all been\nprepared for me by Raffles, in case of need.  I was merely repeating a\nlesson in which I had been closely schooled.  But at the window there\nwas pause enough, filled only by the uncanny wheezing of the man I\ncould not see.\n\n\"I don't see why they should have sent you down,\" he said at length.\n\"We are being quite well looked after by the local police; they're\ngiving us a special call every hour.\"\n\n\"I know that, Mr. Medlicott,\" I rejoined on my own account.  \"I met one\nof them at the corner just now, and we passed the time of night.\"\n\nMy heart was knocking me to bits.  I had started for myself at last.\n\n\"Did you get my name from him?\" pursued my questioner, in a suspicious\nwheeze.\n\n\"No; they gave me that before I started,\" I replied.  \"But I'm sorry\nyou saw me, sir; it's a mere matter of routine, and not intended to\nannoy anybody.  I propose to keep a watch on the place all night, but I\nown it wasn't necessary to trespass as I've done.  I'll take myself off\nthe actual premises, if you prefer it.\"\n\nThis again was all my own; and it met with a success that might have\ngiven me confidence.\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" replied young Medlicott, with a grim geniality.\n\"I've just woke up with the devil of an attack of asthma, and may have\nto sit up in my chair till morning.  You'd better come up and see me\nthrough, and kill two birds while you're about it.  Stay where you are,\nand I'll come down and let you in.\"\n\nHere was a dilemma which Raffles himself had not foreseen!  Outside, in\nthe dark, my audacious part was not hard to play; but to carry the\nimprovisation in-doors was to double at once the difficulty and the\nrisk.  It was true that I had purposely come down in a true detective's\novercoat and bowler; but my personal appearance was hardly of the\ndetective type.  On the other hand as the soi-disant guardian of the\ngifts one might only excite suspicion by refusing to enter the house\nwhere they were.  Nor could I forget that it was my purpose to effect\nsuch entry first or last.  That was the casting consideration.  I\ndecided to take my dilemma by the horns.\n\nThere had been a scraping of matches in the room over the conservatory;\nthe open window had shown for a moment, like an empty picture-frame, a\ngigantic shadow wavering on the ceiling; and in the next half-minute I\nremembered to tie my shoes.  But the light was slow to reappear through\nthe leaded glasses of an outer door farther along the path.  And when\nthe door opened, it was a figure of woe that stood within and held an\nunsteady candle between our faces.\n\nI have seen old men look half their age, and young men look double\ntheirs; but never before or since have I seen a beardless boy bent into\na man of eighty, gasping for every breath, shaken by every gasp,\nswaying, tottering, and choking, as if about to die upon his feet.  Yet\nwith it all, young Medlicott overhauled me shrewdly, and it was several\nmoments before he would let me take the candle from him.\n\n\"I shouldn't have come down--made me worse,\" he began whispering in\nspurts.  \"Worse still going up again.  You must give me an arm. You\nwill come up?  That's right!  Not as bad as I look, you know. Got some\ngood whiskey, too.  Presents are all right; but if they aren't you'll\nhear of it in-doors sooner than out.  Now I'm ready--thanks!  Mustn't\nmake more noise than we can help--wake my mother.\"\n\nIt must have taken us minutes to climb that single flight of stairs.\nThere was just room for me to keep his arm in mine; with the other he\nhauled on the banisters; and so we mounted, step by step, a panting\npause on each, and a pitched battle for breath on the half-landing.  In\nthe end we gained a cosey library, with an open door leading to a\nbedroom beyond.  But the effort had deprived my poor companion of all\npower of speech; his laboring lungs shrieked like the wind; he could\njust point to the door by which we had entered, and which I shut in\nobedience to his gestures, and then to the decanter and its accessories\non the table where he had left them overnight.  I gave him nearly half\na glassful, and his paroxysm subsided a little as he sat hunched up in\na chair.\n\n\"I was a fool ... to turn in,\" he blurted in more whispers between\nlonger pauses.  \"Lying down is the devil ... when you're in for a real\nbad night.  You might get me the brown cigarettes ... on the table in\nthere.  That's right ... thanks awfully ... and now a match!\"\n\nThe asthmatic had bitten off either end of the stramonium cigarette,\nand was soon choking himself with the crude fumes, which he inhaled in\ndesperate gulps, to exhale in furious fits of coughing.  Never was more\nheroic remedy; it seemed a form of lingering suicide; but by degrees\nsome slight improvement became apparent, and at length the sufferer was\nable to sit upright, and to drain his glass with a sigh of rare relief.\nI sighed also, for I had witnessed a struggle for dear life by a man in\nthe flower of his youth, whose looks I liked, whose smile came like the\nsun through the first break in his torments, and whose first words were\nto thank me for the little I had done in bare humanity.\n\nThat made me feel the thing I was.  But the feeling put me on my guard.\nAnd I was not unready for the remark which followed a more exhaustive\nscrutiny than I had hitherto sustained.\n\n\"Do you know,\" said young Medlicott, \"that you aren't a bit like the\ndetective of my dreams?\"\n\n\"Only to proud to hear it,\" I replied.  \"There would be no point in my\nbeing in plain clothes if I looked exactly what I was.\"\n\nMy companion reassured me with a wheezy laugh.\n\n\"There's something in that,\" said he, \"although I do congratulate the\ninsurance people on getting a man of your class to do their dirty work.\nAnd I congratulate myself,\" he was quick enough to add, \"on having you\nto see me through as bad a night as I've had for a long time.  You're\nlike flowers in the depths of winter.  Got a drink?  That's right!  I\nsuppose you didn't happen to bring down an evening paper?\"\n\nI said I had brought one, but had unfortunately left it in the train.\n\n\"What about the Test Match?\" cried my asthmatic, shooting forward in\nhis chair.\n\n\"I can tell you that,\" said I.  \"We went in first--\"\n\n\"Oh, I know all about that,\" he interrupted.  \"I've seen the miserable\nscore up to lunch.  How many did we scrape altogether?\"\n\n\"We're scraping them still.\"\n\n\"No!  How many?\"\n\n\"Over two hundred for seven wickets.\"\n\n\"Who made the stand?\"\n\n\"Raffles, for one.  He was 62 not out at close of play!\"\n\nAnd the note of admiration rang in my voice, though I tried in my\nself-consciousness to keep it out.  But young Medlicott's enthusiasm\nproved an ample cloak for mine; it was he who might have been the\npersonal friend of Raffles; and in his delight he chuckled till he\npuffed and blew again.\n\n\"Good old Raffles!\" he panted in every pause.  \"After being chosen\nlast, and as a bowler-man!  That's the cricketer for me, sir; by Jove,\nwe must have another drink in his honor!  Funny thing, asthma; your\nliquor affects your head no more than it does a man with a snake-bite;\nbut it eases everything else, and sees you through.  Doctors will tell\nyou so, but you've got to ask 'em first; they're no good for asthma!\nI've only known one who could stop an attack, and he knocked me\nsideways with nitrite of amyl.  Funny complaint in other ways; raises\nyour spirits, if anything.  You can't look beyond the next breath.\nNothing else worries you.  Well, well, here's luck to A. J. Raffles,\nand may he get his century in the morning!\"\n\nAnd he struggled to his feet for the toast; but I drank it sitting\ndown.  I felt unreasonably wroth with Raffles, for coming into the\nconversation as he had done--for taking centuries in Test Matches as he\nwas doing, without bothering his head about me.  A failure would have\nbeen in better taste; it would have shown at least some imagination,\nsome anxiety on one's account I did not reflect that even Raffles could\nscarcely be expected to picture me in my cups with the son of the house\nthat I had come to rob; chatting with him, ministering to him; admiring\nhis cheery courage, and honestly attempting to lighten his load!  Truly\nit was an infernal position: how could I rob him or his after this?\nAnd yet I had thrust myself into it; and Raffles would never, never\nunderstand!\n\nEven that was not the worst.  I was not quite sure that young Medlicott\nwas sure of me.  I had feared this from the beginning, and now (over\nthe second glass that could not possibly affect a man in his condition)\nhe practically admitted as much to me. Asthma was such a funny thing\n(he insisted) that it would not worry him a bit to discover that I had\ncome to take the presents instead of to take care of them!  I showed a\nsufficiently faint appreciation of the jest.  And it was presently\npunished as it deserved, by the most violent paroxysm that had seized\nthe sufferer yet: the fight for breath became faster and more furious,\nand the former weapons of no more avail.  I prepared a cigarette, but\nthe poor brute was too breathless to inhale.  I poured out yet more\nwhiskey, but he put it from him with a gesture.\n\n\"Amyl--get me amyl!\" he gasped.  \"The tin on the table by my bed.\"\n\nI rushed into his room, and returned with a little tin of tiny\ncylinders done up like miniature crackers in scraps of calico; the\nspent youth broke one in his handkerchief, in which he immediately\nburied his face.  I watched him closely as a subtle odor reached my\nnostrils; and it was like the miracle of oil upon the billows.  His\nshoulders rested from long travail; the stertorous gasping died away to\na quick but natural respiration; and in the sudden cessation of the\ncruel contest, an uncanny stillness fell upon the scene. Meanwhile the\nhidden face had flushed to the ears, and, when at length it was raised\nto mine, its crimson calm was as incongruous as an optical illusion.\n\n\"It takes the blood from the heart,\" he murmured, \"and clears the whole\nshow for the moment.  If it only lasted!  But you can't take two\nwithout a doctor; one's quite enough to make you smell the brimstone...\nI say, what's up?  You're listening to something! If it's the policeman\nwe'll have a word with him.\"\n\nIt was not the policeman; it was no out-door sound that I had caught in\nthe sudden cessation of the bout for breath.  It was a noise, a\nfootstep, in the room below us.  I went to the window and leaned out:\nright underneath, in the conservatory, was the faintest glimmer of a\nlight in the adjoining room.\n\n\"One of the rooms where the presents are!\" whispered Medlicott at my\nelbow.  And as we withdrew together, I looked him in the face as I had\nnot done all night.\n\nI looked him in the face like an honest man, for a miracle was to make\nme one once more.  My knot was cut--my course inevitable. Mine, after\nall, to prevent the very thing that I had come to do! My gorge had long\nsince risen at the deed; the unforeseen circumstances had rendered it\nimpossible from the first; but now I could afford to recognize the\nimpossibility, and to think of Raffles and the asthmatic alike without\na qualm.  I could play the game by them both, for it was one and the\nsame game.  I could preserve thieves' honor, and yet regain some shred\nof that which I had forfeited as a man!\n\nSo I thought as we stood face to face, our ears straining for the least\nmovement below, our eyes locked in a common anxiety.  Another muffled\nfoot-fall--felt rather than heard--and we exchanged grim nods of\nsimultaneous excitement.  But by this time Medlicott was as helpless as\nhe had been before; the flush had faded from his face, and his\nbreathing alone would have spoiled everything.  In dumb show I had to\norder him to stay where he was, to leave my man to me.  And then it was\nthat in a gusty whisper, with the same shrewd look that had\ndisconcerted me more than once during our vigil, young Medlicott froze\nand fired my blood by turns.\n\n\"I've been unjust to you,\" he said, with his right hand in his\ndressing-gown pocket.  \"I thought for a bit--never mind what I\nthought--I soon saw I was wrong.  But--I've had this thing in my pocket\nall the time!\"\n\nAnd he would have thrust his revolver upon me as a peace-offering, but\nI would not even take his hand, as I tapped the life-preserver in my\npocket, and crept out to earn his honest grip or to fall in the\nattempt.  On the landing I drew Raffles's little weapon, slipped my\nright wrist through the leathern loop, and held it in readiness over my\nright shoulder.  Then, down-stairs I stole, as Raffles himself had\ntaught me, close to the wall, where the planks are nailed.  Nor had I\nmade a sound, to my knowledge; for a door was open, and a light was\nburning, and the light did not flicker as I approached the door.  I\nclenched my teeth and pushed it open; and here was the veriest villain\nwaiting for me, his little lantern held aloft.\n\n\"You blackguard!\" I cried, and with a single thwack I felled the\nruffian to the floor.\n\nThere was no question of a foul blow.  He had been just as ready to\npounce on me; it was simply my luck to have got the first blow home.\nYet a fellow-feeling touched me with remorse, as I stood over the\nsenseless body, sprawling prone, and perceived that I had struck an\nunarmed man.  The lantern only had fallen from his hands; it lay on one\nside, smoking horribly; and a something in the reek caused me to set it\nup in haste and turn the body over with both hands.\n\nShall I ever forget the incredulous horror of that moment?\n\nIt was Raffles himself!\n\nHow it was possible, I did not pause to ask myself; if one man on earth\ncould annihilate space and time, it was the man lying senseless at my\nfeet; and that was Raffles, without an instant's doubt.  He was in\nvillainous guise, which I knew of old, now that I knew the unhappy\nwearer.  His face was grimy, and dexterously plastered with a growth of\nreddish hair; his clothes were those in which he had followed cabs from\nthe London termini; his boots were muffled in thick socks; and I had\nlaid him low with a bloody scalp that filled my cup of horror.  I\ngroaned aloud as I knelt over him and felt his heart.  And I was\nanswered by a bronchial whistle from the door.\n\n\"Jolly well done!\" cheered my asthmatical friend.  \"I heard the whole\nthing--only hope my mother didn't.  We must keep it from her if we can.\"\n\nI could have cursed the creature's mother from my full heart; yet even\nwith my hand on that of Raffles, as I felt his feeble pulse, I told\nmyself that this served him right.  Even had I brained him, the fault\nhad been his, not mine.  And it was a characteristic, an inveterate\nfault, that galled me for all my anguish: to trust and yet distrust me\nto the end, to race through England in the night, to spy upon me at his\nwork--to do it himself after all!\n\n\"Is he dead?\" wheezed the asthmatic coolly.\n\n\"Not he,\" I answered, with an indignation that I dared not show.\n\n\"You must have hit him pretty hard,\" pursued young Medlicott, \"but I\nsuppose it was a case of getting first knock.  And a good job you got\nit, if this was his,\" he added, picking up the murderous little\nlife-preserver which poor Raffles had provided for his own destruction.\n\n\"Look here,\" I answered, sitting back on my heels.  \"He isn't dead, Mr.\nMedlicott, and I don't know how long he'll be as much as stunned. He's\na powerful brute, and you're not fit to lend a hand.  But that\npoliceman of yours can't be far away.  Do you think you could struggle\nout and look for him?\"\n\n\"I suppose I am a bit better than I was,\" he replied doubtfully. \"The\nexcitement seems to have done me good.  If you like to leave me on\nguard with my revolver, I'll undertake that he doesn't escape me.\"\n\nI shook my head with an impatient smile.\n\n\"I should never hear the last of it,\" said I.  \"No, in that case all I\ncan do is to handcuff the fellow and wait till morning if he won't go\nquietly; and he'll be a fool if he does, while there's a fighting\nchance.\"\n\nYoung Medlicott glanced upstairs from his post on the threshold. I\nrefrained from watching him too keenly, but I knew what was in his mind.\n\n\"I'll go,\" he said hurriedly.  \"I'll go as I am, before my mother is\ndisturbed and frightened out of her life.  I owe you something, too,\nnot only for what you've done for me, but for what I was fool enough to\nthink about you at the first blush.  It's entirely through you that I\nfeel as fit as I do for the moment.  So I'll take your tip, and go just\nas I am, before my poor old pipes strike up another tune.\"\n\nI scarcely looked up until the good fellow had turned his back upon the\nfinal tableau of watchful officer and prostrate prisoner and gone out\nwheezing into the night.  But I was at the door to hear the last of him\ndown the path and round the corner of the house. And when I rushed back\ninto the room, there was Raffles sitting cross-legged on the floor, and\nslowly shaking his broken head as he stanched the blood.\n\n\"Et tu, Bunny!\" he groaned.  \"Mine own familiar friend!\"\n\n\"Then you weren't even stunned!\" I exclaimed.  \"Thank God for that!\"\n\n\"Of course I was stunned,\" he murmured, \"and no thanks to you that I\nwasn't brained.  Not to know me in the kit you've seen scores of times!\nYou never looked at me, Bunny; you didn't give me time to open my\nmouth.  I was going to let you run me in so prettily!  We'd have walked\noff arm-in-arm; now it's as tight a place as ever we were in, though\nyou did get rid of old blow-pipes rather nicely. But we shall have the\ndevil's own run for our money!\"\n\nRaffles had picked himself up between his mutterings, and I had\nfollowed him to the door into the garden, where he stood busy with the\nkey in the dark, having blown out his lantern and handed it to me.  But\nthough I followed Raffles, as my nature must, I was far too embittered\nto answer him again.  And so it was for some minutes that might furnish\nforth a thrilling page, but not a novel one to those who know their\nRaffles and put up with me.  Suffice it that we left a locked door\nbehind us, and the key on the garden wall, which was the first of half\na dozen that we scaled before dropping into a lane that led to a\nfoot-bridge higher up the backwater.  And when we paused upon the\nfoot-bridge, the houses along the bank were still in peace and darkness.\n\nKnowing my Raffles as I did, I was not surprised when he dived under\none end of this bridge, and came up with his Inverness cape and opera\nhat, which he had hidden there on his way to the house. The thick socks\nwere peeled from his patent-leathers, the ragged trousers stripped from\nan evening pair, bloodstains and Newgate fringe removed at the water's\nedge, and the whole sepulchre whited in less time than the thing takes\nto tell.  Nor was that enough for Raffles, but he must alter me as\nwell, by wearing my overcoat under his cape, and putting his Zingari\nscarf about my neck.\n\n\"And now,\" said he, \"you may be glad to hear there's a 3:12 from\nSurbiton, which we could catch on all fours.  If you like we'll go\nseparately, but I don't think there's the slightest danger now,\n and I begin to wonder what's happening to old blow-pipes.\"\n\nSo, indeed, did I, and with no small concern, until I read of his\nadventures (and our own) in the newspapers.  It seemed that he had made\na gallant spurt into the road, and there paid the penalty of his\nrashness by a sudden incapacity to move another inch.  It had\neventually taken him twenty minutes to creep back to locked doors, and\nanother ten to ring up the inmates.  His description of my personal\nappearance, as reported in the papers, is the only thing that\nreconciles me to the thought of his sufferings during that half-hour.\n\nBut at the time I had other thoughts, and they lay too deep for idle\nwords, for to me also it was a bitter hour.  I had not only failed in\nmy self-sought task; I had nearly killed my comrade into the bargain.\nI had meant well by friend and foe in turn, and I had ended in doing\nexecrably by both.  It was not all my fault, but I knew how much my\nweakness had contributed to the sum.  And I must walk with the man\nwhose fault it was, who had travelled two hundred miles to obtain this\nlast proof of my weakness, to bring it home to me, and to make our\nintimacy intolerable from that hour.  I must walk with him to Surbiton,\nbut I need not talk; all through Thames Ditton I had ignored his\nsallies; nor yet when he ran his arm through mine, on the river front,\nwhen we were nearly there, would I break the seal my pride had set upon\nmy lips.\n\n\"Come, Bunny,\" he said at last, \"I have been the one to suffer most,\nwhen all's said and done, and I'll be the first to say that I deserved\nit.  You've broken my head; my hair's all glued up in my gore; and what\nyarn I'm to put up at Manchester, or how I shall take the field at all,\nI really don't know.  Yet I don't blame you, Bunny, and I do blame\nmyself.  Isn't it rather hard luck if I am to go unforgiven into the\nbargain?  I admit that I made a mistake; but, my dear fellow, I made it\nentirely for your sake.\"\n\n\"For my sake!\" I echoed bitterly.\n\nRaffles was more generous; he ignored my tone.\n\n\"I was miserable about you--frankly--miserable!\" he went on.  \"I\ncouldn't get it out of my head that somehow you would be laid by the\nheels.  It was not your pluck that I distrusted, my dear fellow, but it\nwas your very pluck that made me tremble for you.  I couldn't get you\nout of my head.  I went in when runs were wanted, but I give you my\nword that I was more anxious about you; and no doubt that's why I\nhelped to put on some runs.  Didn't you see it in the paper, Bunny?\nIt's the innings of my life, so far.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"I saw that you were in at close of play.  But I don't\nbelieve it was you--I believe you have a double who plays your cricket\nfor you!\"\n\nAnd at the moment that seemed less incredible than the fact.\n\n\"I'm afraid you didn't read your paper very carefully,\" said Raffles,\nwith the first trace of pique in his tone.  \"It was rain that closed\nplay before five o'clock.  I hear it was a sultry day in town, but at\nManchester we got the storm, and the ground was under water in ten\nminutes.  I never saw such a thing in my life.  There was absolutely\nnot the ghost of a chance of another ball being bowled. But I had\nchanged before I thought of doing what I did.  It was only when I was\non my way back to the hotel, by myself, because I couldn't talk to a\nsoul for thinking of you, that on the spur of the moment I made the man\ntake me to the station instead, and was under way in the restaurant car\nbefore I had time to think twice about it.  I am not sure that of all\nthe mad deeds I have ever done, this was not the maddest of the lot!\"\n\n\"It was the finest,\" I said in a low voice; for now I marvelled more at\nthe impulse which had prompted his feat, and at the circumstances\nsurrounding it, than even at the feat itself.\n\n\"Heaven knows,\" he went on, \"what they are saying and doing in\nManchester!  But what can they say?  'What business is it of theirs?  I\nwas there when play stopped, and I shall be there when it starts again.\nWe shall be at Waterloo just after half-past three, and that's going to\ngive me an hour at the Albany on my way to Euston, and another hour at\nOld Trafford before play begins. What's the matter with that?  I don't\nsuppose I shall notch any more, but all the better if I don't; if we\nhave a hot sun after the storm, the sooner they get in the better; and\nmay I have a bowl at them while the ground bites!\"\n\n\"I'll come up with you,\" I said, \"and see you at it.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" replied Raffles, \"that was my whole feeling about\nyou.  I wanted to 'see you at it'--that was absolutely all.  I wanted\nto be near enough to lend a hand if you got tied up, as the best of us\nwill at times.  I knew the ground better than you, and I simply\ncouldn't keep away from it.  But I didn't mean you to know that I was\nthere; if everything had gone as I hoped it might, I should have\nsneaked back to town without ever letting you know I had been up.  You\nshould never have dreamt that I had been at your elbow; you would have\nbelieved in yourself, and in my belief in you, and the rest would have\nbeen silence till the grave.  So I dodged you at Waterloo, and I tried\nnot to let you know that I was following you from Esher station.  But\nyou suspected somebody was; you stopped to listen more than once; after\nthe second time I dropped behind, but gained on you by taking the short\ncut by Imber Court and over the foot-bridge where I left my coat and\nhat.  I was actually in the garden before you were.  I saw you smoke\nyour Sullivan, and I was rather proud of you for it, though you must\nnever do that sort of thing again.  I heard almost every word between\nyou and the poor devil upstairs.  And up to a certain point, Bunny, I\nreally thought you played the scene to perfection.\"\n\nThe station lights were twinkling ahead of us in the fading velvet of\nthe summer's night.  I let them increase and multiply before I spoke.\n\n\"And where,\" I asked, \"did you think I first went wrong?\"\n\n\"In going in-doors at all,\" said Raffles.  \"If I had done that, I\nshould have done exactly what you did from that point on.  You couldn't\nhelp yourself, with that poor brute in that state.  And I admired you\nimmensely, Bunny, if that's any comfort to you now.\"\n\nComfort!  It was wine in every vein, for I knew that Raffles meant what\nhe said, and with his eyes I soon saw myself in braver colors. I ceased\nto blush for the vacillations of the night, since he condoned them.  I\ncould even see that I had behaved with a measure of decency, in a truly\ntrying situation, now that Raffles seemed to think so.  He had changed\nmy whole view of his proceedings and my own, in every incident of the\nnight but one.  There was one thing, however, which he might forgive\nme, but which I felt that I could forgive neither Raffles nor myself.\nAnd that was the contused scalp wound over which I shuddered in the\ntrain.\n\n\"And to think that I did that,\" I groaned, \"and that you laid yourself\nopen to it, and that we have neither of us got another thing to show\nfor our night's work!  That poor chap said it was as bad a night as he\nhad ever had in his life; but I call it the very worst that you and I\never had in ours.\"\n\nRaffles was smiling under the double lamps of the first-class\ncompartment that we had to ourselves.\n\n\"I wouldn't say that, Bunny.  We have done worse.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that you did anything at all?\"\n\n\"My dear Bunny,\" replied Raffles, \"you should remember how long I had\nbeen maturing felonious little plan, what a blow it was to me to have\nto turn it over to you, and how far I had travelled to see that you did\nit and yourself as well as might be.  You know what I did see, and how\nwell I understood.  I tell you again that I should have done the same\nthing myself, in your place.  But I was not in your place, Bunny.  My\nhands were not tied like yours. Unfortunately, most of the jewels have\ngone on the honeymoon with the happy pair; but these emerald links are\nall right, and I don't know what the bride was doing to leave this\ndiamond comb behind. Here, too, is the old silver skewer I've been\nwanting for years--they make the most charming paper-knives in the\nworld--and this gold cigarette-case will just do for your smaller\nSullivans.\"\n\nNor were these the only pretty things that Raffles set out in twinkling\narray upon the opposite cushions.  But I do not pretend that this was\none of our heavy hauls, or deny that its chief interest still resides\nin the score of the Second Test Match of that Australian tour.\n\n\n\n\nA Trap to Catch a Cracksman\n\nI was just putting out my light when the telephone rang a furious\ntocsin in the next room.  I flounced out of bed more asleep than awake;\nin another minute I should have been past ringing up.  It was one\no'clock in the morning, and I had been dining with Swigger Morrison at\nhis club.\n\n\"Hulloa!\"\n\n\"That you, Bunny?\"\n\n\"Yes--are you Raffles?\"\n\n\"What's left of me!  Bunny, I want you--quick.\"\n\nAnd even over the wire his voice was faint with anxiety and\napprehension.\n\n\"What on earth has happened?\"\n\n\"Don't ask!  You never know--\"\n\n\"I'll come at once.  Are you there, Raffles?\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Are you there, man?\"\n\n\"Ye--e--es.\"\n\n\"At the Albany?\"\n\n\"No, no; at Maguire's.\"\n\n\"You never said so.  And where's Maguire?\"\n\n\"In Half-moon Street.\"\n\n\"I know that.  Is he there now?\"\n\n\"No--not come in yet--and I'm caught.\"\n\n\"Caught!\"\n\n\"In that trap he bragged about.  It serves me right.  I didn't believe\nin it.  But I'm caught at last ... caught ... at last!\"\n\n\"When he told us he set it every night!  Oh, Raffles, what sort of a\ntrap is it?  What shall I do?  What shall I bring?\"\n\nBut his voice had grown fainter and wearier with every answer, and now\nthere was no answer at all.  Again and again I asked Raffles if he was\nthere; the only sound to reach me in reply was the low metallic hum of\nthe live wire between his ear and mine.  And then, as I sat gazing\ndistractedly at my four safe walls, with the receiver still pressed to\nmy head, there came a single groan, followed by the dull and dreadful\ncrash of a human body falling in a heap.\n\nIn utter panic I rushed back into my bedroom, and flung myself into the\ncrumpled shirt and evening clothes that lay where I had cast them off.\nBut I knew no more what I was doing than what to do next I afterward\nfound that I had taken out a fresh tie, and tied it rather better than\nusual; but I can remember thinking of nothing but Raffles in some\ndiabolical man-trap, and of a grinning monster stealing in to strike\nhim senseless with one murderous blow.  I must have looked in the glass\nto array myself as I did; but the mind's eye was the seeing eye, and it\nwas filled with this frightful vision of the notorious pugilist known\nto fame and infamy as Barney Maguire.\n\nIt was only the week before that Raffles and I had been introduced to\nhim at the Imperial Boxing Club.  Heavy-weight champion of the United\nStates, the fellow was still drunk with his sanguinary triumphs on that\nside, and clamoring for fresh conquests on ours. But his reputation had\ncrossed the Atlantic before Maguire himself; the grandiose hotels had\nclosed their doors to him; and he had already taken and sumptuously\nfurnished the house in Half-moon Street which does not re-let to this\nday.  Raffles had made friends with the magnificent brute, while I took\ntimid stock of his diamond studs, his jewelled watch-chain, his\neighteen-carat bangle, and his six-inch lower jaw.  I had shuddered to\nsee Raffles admiring the gewgaws in his turn, in his own brazen\nfashion, with that air of the cool connoisseur which had its double\nmeaning for me.  I for my part would as lief have looked a tiger in the\nteeth.  And when we finally went home with Maguire to see his other\ntrophies, it seemed to me like entering the tiger's lair.  But an\nastounding lair it proved, fitted throughout by one eminent firm, and\nringing to the rafters with the last word on fantastic furniture.\n\nThe trophies were a still greater surprise.  They opened my eyes to the\nrosier aspect of the noble art, as presently practised on the right\nside of the Atlantic.  Among other offerings, we were permitted to\nhandle the jewelled belt presented to the pugilist by the State of\nNevada, a gold brick from the citizens of Sacramento, and a model of\nhimself in solid silver from the Fisticuff Club in New York.  I still\nremember waiting with bated breath for Raffles to ask Maguire if he\nwere not afraid of burglars, and Maguire replying that he had a trap to\ncatch the cleverest cracksman alive, but flatly refusing to tell us\nwhat it was.  I could not at the moment conceive a more terrible trap\nthan the heavy-weight himself behind a curtain.  Yet it was easy to see\nthat Raffles had accepted the braggart's boast as a challenge.  Nor did\nhe deny it later when I taxed him with his mad resolve; he merely\nrefused to allow me to implicate myself in its execution.  Well, there\nwas a spice of savage satisfaction in the thought that Raffles had been\nobliged to turn to me in the end.  And, but for the dreadful thud which\nI had heard over the telephone, I might have extracted some genuine\ncomfort from the unerring sagacity with which he had chosen his night.\n\nWithin the last twenty-four hours Barney Maguire had fought his first\ngreat battle on British soil.  Obviously, he would no longer be the man\nthat he had been in the strict training before the fight; never, as I\ngathered, was such a ruffian more off his guard, or less capable of\nprotecting himself and his possessions, than in these first hours of\nrelaxation and inevitable debauchery for which Raffles had waited with\ncharacteristic foresight.  Nor was the terrible Barney likely to be\nmore abstemious for signal punishment sustained in a far from bloodless\nvictory.  Then what could be the meaning of that sickening and most\nsuggestive thud?  Could it be the champion himself who had received the\ncoup de grace in his cups? Raffles was the very man to administer\nit--but he had not talked like that man through the telephone.\n\nAnd yet--and yet--what else could have happened?  I must have asked\nmyself the question between each and all of the above reflections, made\npartly as I dressed and partly in the hansom on the way to Half-moon\nStreet.  It was as yet the only question in my mind.  You must know\nwhat your emergency is before you can decide how to cope with it; and\nto this day I sometimes tremble to think of the rashly direct method by\nwhich I set about obtaining the requisite information.  I drove every\nyard of the way to the pugilist's very door.  You will remember that I\nhad been dining with Swigger Morrison at his club.\n\nYet at the last I had a rough idea of what I meant to say when the door\nwas opened.  It seemed almost probable that the tragic end of our talk\nover the telephone had been caused by the sudden arrival and as sudden\nviolence of Barney Maguire.  In that case I was resolved to tell him\nthat Raffles and I had made a bet about his burglar trap, and that I\nhad come to see who had won.  I might or might not confess that Raffles\nhad rung me out of bed to this end. If, however, I was wrong about\nMaguire, and he had not come home at all, then my action would depend\nupon the menial who answered my reckless ring.  But it should result in\nthe rescue of Raffles by hook or crook.\n\nI had the more time to come to some decision, since I rang and rang in\nvain.  The hall, indeed, was in darkness; but when I peeped through the\nletter-box I could see a faint beam of light from the back room.  That\nwas the room in which Maguire kept his trophies and set his trap.  All\nwas quiet in the house: could they have haled the intruder to Vine\nStreet in the short twenty minutes which it had taken me to dress and\nto drive to the spot?  That was an awful thought; but even as I hoped\nagainst hope, and rang once more, speculation and suspense were cut\nshort in the last fashion to be foreseen.\n\nA brougham was coming sedately down the street from Piccadilly; to my\nhorror, it stopped behind me as I peered once more through the\nletter-box, and out tumbled the dishevelled prizefighter and two\ncompanions.  I was nicely caught in my turn.  There was a lamp-post\nright opposite the door, and I can still see the three of them\nregarding me in its light.  The pugilist had been at least a fine\nfigure of a bully and a braggart when I saw him before his fight; now\nhe had a black eye and a bloated lip, hat on the back of his head, and\nmade-up tie under one ear.  His companions were his sallow little\nYankee secretary, whose name I really forget, but whom I met with\nMaguire at the Boxing Club, and a very grand person in a second skin of\nshimmering sequins.\n\nI can neither forget nor report the terms in which Barney Maguire asked\nme who I was and what I was doing there.  Thanks, however, to Swigger\nMorrison's hospitality, I readily reminded him of our former meeting,\nand of more that I only recalled as the words were in my mouth.\n\n\"You'll remember Raffles,\" said I, \"if you don't remember me.  You\nshowed us your trophies the other night, and asked us both to look you\nup at any hour of the day or night after the fight.\"\n\nI was going on to add that I had expected to find Raffles there before\nme, to settle a wager that we had made about the man-trap. But the\nindiscretion was interrupted by Maguire himself, whose dreadful fist\nbecame a hand that gripped mine with brute fervor, while with the other\nhe clouted me on the back.\n\n\"You don't say!\" he cried.  \"I took you for some darned crook, but now\nI remember you perfectly.  If you hadn't've spoke up slick I'd have\nbu'st your face in, sonny.  I would, sure!  Come right in, and have a\ndrink to show there's--Jeehoshaphat!\"\n\nThe secretary had turned the latch-key in the door, only to be hauled\nback by the collar as the door stood open, and the light from the inner\nroom was seen streaming upon the banisters at the foot of the narrow\nstairs.\n\n\"A light in my den,\" said Maguire in a mighty whisper, \"and the blamed\ndoor open, though the key's in my pocket and we left it locked!  Talk\nabout crooks, eh?  Holy smoke, how I hope we've landed one alive!  You\nladies and gentlemen, lay round where you are, while I see.\"\n\nAnd the hulking figure advanced on tiptoe, like a performing elephant,\nuntil just at the open door, when for a second we saw his left\nrevolving like a piston and his head thrown back at its fighting angle.\nBut in another second his fists were hands again, and Maguire was\nrubbing them together as he stood shaking with laughter in the light of\nthe open door.\n\n\"Walk up!\" he cried, as he beckoned to us three.  \"Walk up and see one\no' their blamed British crooks laid as low as the blamed carpet, and\nnailed as tight!\"\n\nImagine my feelings on the mat!  The sallow secretary went first; the\nsequins glittered at his heels, and I must own that for one base moment\nI was on the brink of bolting through the street door.  It had never\nbeen shut behind us.  I shut it myself in the end.  Yet it was small\ncredit to me that I actually remained on the same side of the door as\nRaffles.\n\n\"Reel home-grown, low-down, unwashed Whitechapel!\"  I had heard Maguire\nremark within.  \"Blamed if our Bowery boys ain't cock-angels to scum\nlike this.  Ah, you biter, I wouldn't soil my knuckles on your ugly\nface; but if I had my thick boots on I'd dance the soul out of your\ncarcass for two cents!\"\n\nAfter this it required less courage to join the others in the inner\nroom; and for some moments even I failed to identify the truly\nrepulsive object about which I found them grouped.  There was no false\nhair upon the face, but it was as black as any sweep's.  The clothes,\non the other hand, were new to me, though older and more pestiferous in\nthemselves than most worn by Raffles for professional purposes.  And at\nfirst, as I say, I was far from sure whether it was Raffles at all; but\nI remembered the crash that cut short our talk over the telephone; and\nthis inanimate heap of rags was lying directly underneath a wall\ninstrument, with the receiver dangling over him.\n\n\"Think you know him?\" asked the sallow secretary, as I stooped and\npeered with my heart in my boots.\n\n\"Good Lord, no!  I only wanted to see if he was dead,\" I explained,\nhaving satisfied myself that it was really Raffles, and that Raffles\nwas really insensible.  \"But what on earth has happened?\"  I asked in\nmy turn.\n\n\"That's what I want to know,\" whined the person in sequins, who had\ncontributed various ejaculations unworthy of report, and finally\nsubsided behind an ostentatious fan.\n\n\"I should judge,\" observed the secretary, \"that it's for Mr. Maguire to\nsay, or not to say, just as he darn pleases.\"\n\nBut the celebrated Barney stood upon a Persian hearth-rug, beaming upon\nus all in a triumph too delicious for immediate translation into words.\nThe room was furnished as a study, and most artistically furnished, if\nyou consider outlandish shapes in fumed oak artistic. There was nothing\nof the traditional prize-fighter about Barney Maguire, except his\nvocabulary and his lower jaw.  I had seen over his house already, and\nit was fitted and decorated throughout by a high-art firm which\nexhibits just such a room as that which was the scene of our\ntragedietta.  The person in the sequins lay glistening like a landed\nsalmon in a quaint chair of enormous nails and tapestry compact.  The\nsecretary leaned against an escritoire with huge hinges of beaten\nmetal.  The pugilist's own background presented an elaborate scheme of\noak and tiles, with inglenooks green from the joiner, and a china\ncupboard with leaded panes behind his bullet head.  And his bloodshot\neyes rolled with rich delight from the decanter and glasses on the\noctagonal table to another decanter in the quaintest and craftiest of\nrevolving spirit tables.\n\n\"Isn't it bully?\" asked the prize-fighter, smiling on us each in turn,\nwith his black and bloodshot eyes and his bloated lip.  \"To think that\nI've only to invent a trap to catch a crook, for a blamed crook to walk\nright into!  You, Mr. Man,\" and he nodded his great head at me, \"you'll\nrecollect me telling you that I'd gotten one when you come in that\nnight with the other sport?  Say, pity he's not with you now; he was a\ngood boy, and I liked him a lot; but he wanted to know too much, and I\nguess he'd got to want.  But I'm liable to tell you now, or else bu'st.\nSee that decanter on the table?\"\n\n\"I was just looking at it,\" said the person in sequins.  \"You don't\nknow what a turn I've had, or you'd offer me a little something.\"\n\n\"You shall have a little something in a minute,\" rejoined Maguire. \"But\nif you take a little anything out of that decanter, you'll collapse\nlike our friend upon the floor.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" I cried out, with involuntary indignation, and his fell\nscheme broke upon me in a clap.\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" said Maguire, fixing me with his bloodshot orbs.  \"My trap\nfor crooks and cracksmen is a bottle of hocussed whiskey, and I guess\nthat's it on the table, with the silver label around its neck. Now look\nat this other decanter, without any label at all; but for that they're\nthe dead spit of each other.  I'll put them side by side, so you can\nsee.  It isn't only the decanters, but the liquor looks the same in\nboth, and tastes so you wouldn't know the difference till you woke up\nin your tracks.  I got the poison from a blamed Indian away west, and\nit's ruther ticklish stuff.  So I keep the label around the\ntrap-bottle, and only leave it out nights. That's the idea, and that's\nall there is to it,\" added Maguire, putting the labelled decanter back\nin the stand.  \"But I figure it's enough for ninety-nine crooks out of\na hundred, and nineteen out of twenty 'll have their liquor before they\ngo to work.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't figure on that,\" observed the secretary, with a downward\nglance as though at the prostrate Raffles.  \"Have you looked to see if\nthe trophies are all safe?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Maguire, with a glance at the pseudo-antique cabinet in\nwhich he kept them.  \"Then you can save yourself the trouble,\" rejoined\nthe secretary, as he dived under the octagonal table, and came up with\na small black bag that I knew at a glance.  It was the one that Raffles\nhad used for heavy plunder ever since I had known him.\n\nThe bag was so heavy now that the secretary used both hands to get it\non the table.  In another moment he had taken out the jewelled belt\npresented to Maguire by the State of Nevada, the solid silver statuette\nof himself, and the gold brick from the citizens of Sacramento.\n\nEither the sight of his treasures, so nearly lost, or the feeling that\nthe thief had dared to tamper with them after all, suddenly infuriated\nMaguire to such an extent that he had bestowed a couple of brutal kicks\nupon the senseless form of Raffles before the secretary and I could\ninterfere.\n\n\"Play light, Mr. Maguire!\" cried the sallow secretary.  \"The man's\ndrugged, as well as down.\"\n\n\"He'll be lucky if he ever gets up, blight and blister him!\"\n\n\"I should judge it about time to telephone for the police.\"\n\n\"Not till I've done with him.  Wait till he comes to!  I guess I'll\npunch his face into a jam pudding!  He shall wash down his teeth with\nhis blood before the coppers come in for what's left!\"\n\n\"You make me feel quite ill,\" complained the grand lady in the chair.\n\"I wish you'd give me a little something, and not be more vulgar than\nyou can 'elp.\"\n\n\"Help yourself,\" said Maguire, ungallantly, \"and don't talk through\nyour hat.  Say, what's the matter with the 'phone?\"\n\nThe secretary had picked up the dangling receiver.\n\n\"It looks to me,\" said he, \"as though the crook had rung up somebody\nbefore he went off.\"\n\nI turned and assisted the grand lady to the refreshment that she craved.\n\n\"Like his cheek!\" Maguire thundered.  \"But who in blazes should he ring\nup?\"\n\n\"It'll all come out,\" said the secretary.  \"They'll tell us at the\ncentral, and we shall find out fast enough.\"\n\n\"It don't matter now,\" said Maguire.  \"Let's have a drink and then\nrouse the devil up.\"\n\nBut now I was shaking in my shoes.  I saw quite clearly what this\nmeant.  Even if I rescued Raffles for the time being, the police would\npromptly ascertain that it was I who had been rung up by the burglar,\nand the fact of my not having said a word about it would be directly\ndamning to me, if in the end it did not incriminate us both.  It made\nme quite faint to feel that we might escape the Scylla of our present\nperil and yet split on the Charybdis of circumstantial evidence.  Yet I\ncould see no middle course of conceivable safety, if I held my tongue\nanother moment.  So I spoke up desperately, with the rash resolution\nwhich was the novel feature of my whole conduct on this occasion.  But\nany sheep would be resolute and rash after dining with Swigger Morrison\nat his club.\n\n\"I wonder if he rang me up?\" I exclaimed, as if inspired.\n\n\"You, sonny?\" echoed Maguire, decanter in hand.  \"What in hell could he\nknow about you?\"\n\n\"Or what could you know about him?\" amended the secretary, fixing me\nwith eyes like drills.\n\n\"Nothing,\" I admitted, regretting my temerity with all my heart. \"But\nsome one did ring me up about an hour ago.  I thought it was Raffles.\nI told you I expected to find him here, if you remember.\"\n\n\"But I don't see what that's got to do with the crook,\" pursued the\nsecretary, with his relentless eyes boring deeper and deeper into mine.\n\n\"No more do I,\" was my miserable reply.  But there was a certain\ncomfort in his words, and some simultaneous promise in the quantity of\nspirit which Maguire splashed into his glass.\n\n\"Were you cut off sudden?\" asked the secretary, reaching for the\ndecanter, as the three of us sat round the octagonal table.\n\n\"So suddenly,\" I replied, \"that I never knew who it was who rang me up.\nNo, thank you--not any for me.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Maguire, raising a depressed head suddenly.  \"You won't\nhave a drink in my house?  Take care, young man.  That's not being a\ngood boy!\"\n\n\"But I've been dining out,\" I expostulated, \"and had my whack.  I\nreally have.\"\n\nBarney Maguire smote the table with terrific\n\n\"Say, sonny, I like you a lot,\" said he.  \"But I shan't like you any if\nyou're not a good boy!\"\n\n\"Very well, very well,\" I said hurriedly.  \"One finger, if I must.\"\n\nAnd the secretary helped me to not more than two.\n\n\"Why should it have been your friend Raffles?\" he inquired, returning\nremorselessly to the charge, while Maguire roared \"Drink up!\" and then\ndrooped once more.\n\n\"I was half asleep,\" I answered, \"and he was the first person who\noccurred to me.  We are both on the telephone, you see.  And we had\nmade a bet--\"\n\nThe glass was at my lips, but I was able to set it down untouched.\nMaguire's huge jaw had dropped upon his spreading shirt-front, and\nbeyond him I saw the person in sequins fast asleep in the artistic\narmchair.\n\n\"What bet?\" asked a voice with a sudden start in it.  The secretary was\nblinking as he drained his glass.\n\n\"About the very thing we've just had explained to us,\" said I, watching\nmy man intently as I spoke.  \"I made sure it was a man-trap. Raffles\nthought it must be something else.  We had a tremendous argument about\nit.  Raffles said it wasn't a man-trap.  I said it was.  We had a bet\nabout it in the end.  I put my money on the man-trap.  Raffles put his\nupon the other thing.  And Raffles was right--it wasn't a man-trap.\nBut it's every bit as good--every little bit--and the whole boiling of\nyou are caught in it except me!\"\n\nI sank my voice with the last sentence, but I might just as well have\nraised it instead.  I had said the same thing over and over again to\nsee whether the wilful tautology would cause the secretary to open his\neyes.  It seemed to have had the very opposite effect. His head fell\nforward on the table, with never a quiver at the blow, never a twitch\nwhen I pillowed it upon one of his own sprawling arms.  And there sat\nMaguire bolt upright, but for the jowl upon his shirt-front, while the\nsequins twinkled in a regular rise and fall upon the reclining form of\nthe lady in the fanciful chair.  All three were sound asleep, by what\naccident or by whose design I did not pause to inquire; it was enough\nto ascertain the fact beyond all chance of error.\n\nI turned my attention to Raffles last of all.  There was the other side\nof the medal.  Raffles was still sleeping as sound as the enemy--or so\nI feared at first I shook him gently: he made no sign.  I introduced\nvigor into the process: he muttered incoherently. I caught and twisted\nan unresisting wrist--and at that he yelped profanely.  But it was many\nand many an anxious moment before his blinking eyes knew mine.\n\n\"Bunny!\" he yawned, and nothing more until his position came back to\nhim.  \"So you came to me,\" he went on, in a tone that thrilled me with\nits affectionate appreciation, \"as I knew you would!  Have they turned\nup yet?  They will any minute, you know; there's not one to lose.\"\n\n\"No, they won't, old man!\" I whispered.  And he sat up and saw the\ncomatose trio for himself.\n\nRaffles seemed less amazed at the result than I had been as a puzzled\nwitness of the process; on the other hand, I had never seen anything\nquite so exultant as the smile that broke through his blackened\ncountenance like a light.  It was all obviously no great surprise, and\nno puzzle at all, to Raffles.\n\n\"How much did they have, Bunny?\" were his first whispered words.\n\n\"Maguire a good three fingers, and the others at least two.\"\n\n\"Then we needn't lower our voices, and we needn't walk on our toes.\nEheu!  I dreamed somebody was kicking me in the ribs, and I believe it\nmust have been true.\"\n\nHe had risen with a hand to his side and a wry look on his sweep's face.\n\n\"You can guess which of them it was,\" said I.  \"The beast is jolly well\nserved!\"\n\nAnd I shook my fist in the paralytic face of the most brutal bruiser of\nhis time.\n\n\"He is safe till the forenoon, unless they bring a doctor to him,\" said\nRaffles.  \"I don't suppose we could rouse him now if we tried. How much\nof the fearsome stuff do you suppose I took?  About a tablespoonful!  I\nguessed what it was, and couldn't resist making sure; the minute I was\nsatisfied, I changed the label and the position of the two decanters,\nlittle thinking I should stay to see the fun; but in another minute I\ncould hardly keep my eyes open. I realized then that I was fairly\npoisoned with some subtle drug. If I left the house at all in that\nstate, I must leave the spoil behind, or be found drunk in the gutter\nwith my head on the swag itself.  In any case I should have been picked\nup and run in, and that might have led to anything.\"\n\n\"So you rang me up!\"\n\n\"It was my last brilliant inspiration--a sort of flash in the brain-pan\nbefore the end--and I remember very little about it.  I was more asleep\nthan awake at the time.\"\n\n\"You sounded like it, Raffles, now that one has the clue.\"\n\n\"I can't remember a word I said, or what was the end of it, Bunny.\"\n\n\"You fell in a heap before you came to the end.\"\n\n\"You didn't hear that through the telephone?\"\n\n\"As though we had been in the same room: only I thought it was Maguire\nwho had stolen a march on you and knocked you out.\"\n\nI had never seen Raffles more interested and impressed; but at this\npoint his smile altered, his eyes softened, and I found my hand in his.\n\n\"You thought that, and yet you came like a shot to do battle for my\nbody with Barney Maguire!  Jack-the-Giant-killer wasn't in it with you,\nBunny!\"\n\n\"It was no credit to me--it was rather the other thing,\" said I,\nremembering my rashness and my luck, and confessing both in a breath.\n\"You know old Swigger Morrison?\" I added in final explanation.  \"I had\nbeen dining with him at his club!\"\n\nRaffles shook his long old head.  And the kindly light in his eyes was\nstill my infinite reward.\n\n\"I don't care,\" said he, \"how deeply you had been dining: in vino\nveritas, Bunny, and your pluck would always out!  I have never doubted\nit, and I never shall.  In fact, I rely on nothing else to get us out\nof this mess.\"\n\nMy face must have fallen, as my heart sank at these words.  I had said\nto myself that we were out of the mess already--that we had merely to\nmake a clean escape from the house--now the easiest thing in the world.\nBut as I looked at Raffles, and as Raffles looked at me, on the\nthreshold of the room where the three sleepers slept on without sound\nor movement, I grasped the real problem that lay before us.  It was\ntwofold; and the funny thing was that I had seen both horns of the\ndilemma for myself, before Raffles came to his senses.  But with\nRaffles in his right mind, I had ceased to apply my own, or to carry my\nshare of our common burden another inch.  It had been an unconscious\nwithdrawal on my part, an instinctive tribute to my leader; but, I was\nsufficiently ashamed of it as we stood and faced the problem in each\nother's eyes.\n\n\"If we simply cleared out,\" continued Raffles, \"you would be\nincriminated in the first place as my accomplice, and once they had you\nthey would have a compass with the needle pointing straight to me.\nThey mustn't have either of us, Bunny, or they will get us both.  And\nfor my part they may as well!\"\n\nI echoed a sentiment that was generosity itself in Raffles, but in my\ncase a mere truism.\n\n\"It's easy enough for me,\" he went on.  \"I am a common house-breaker,\nand I escape.  They don't know me from Noah.  But they do know you; and\nhow do you come to let me escape?  What has happened to you, Bunny?\nThat's the crux.  What could have happened after they all dropped off?\"\nAnd for a minute Raffles frowned and smiled like a sensation novelist\nworking out a plot; then the light broke, and transfigured him through\nhis burnt cork.  \"I've got it, Bunny!\" he exclaimed.  \"You took some of\nthe stuff yourself, though of course not nearly so much as they did.\n\n\"Splendid!\" I cried.  \"They really were pressing it upon me at the end,\nand I did say it must be very little.\"\n\n\"You dozed off in your turn, but you were naturally the first to come\nto yourself.  I had flown; so had the gold brick, the jewelled belt,\nand the silver statuette.  You tried to rouse the others.  You couldn't\nsucceed; nor would you if you did try.  So what did you do? What's the\nonly really innocent thing you could do in the circumstances?\"\n\n\"Go for the police,\" I suggested dubiously, little relishing the\nprospect.\n\n\"There's a telephone installed for the purpose,\" said Raffles.  \"I\nshould ring them up, if I were you.  Try not to look blue about it,\nBunny.  They're quite the nicest fellows in the world, and what you\nhave to tell them is a mere microbe to the camels I've made them\nswallow without a grain of salt.  It's really the most convincing story\none could conceive; but unfortunately there's another point which will\ntake more explaining away.\"\n\nAnd even Raffles looked grave enough as I nodded.\n\n\"You mean that they'll find out you rang me up?\"\n\n\"They may,\" said Raffles.  \"I see that I managed to replace the\nreceiver all right.  But still--they may.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid they will,\" said I, uncomfortably.  \"I'm very much afraid I\ngave something of the kind away.  You see, you had not replaced the\nreceiver; it was dangling over you where you lay. This very question\ncame up, and the brutes themselves seemed so quick to see its\npossibilities that I thought best to take the bull by the horns and own\nthat I had been rung up by somebody. To be absolutely honest, I even\nwent so far as to say I thought it was Raffles!\"\n\n\"You didn't, Bunny!\"\n\n\"What could I say?  I was obliged to think of somebody, and I saw they\nwere not going to recognize you.  So I put up a yarn about a wager we\nhad made about this very trap of Maguire's.  You see, Raffles, I've\nnever properly told you how I got in, and there's no time now; but the\nfirst thing I had said was that I half expected to find you here before\nme.  That was in case they spotted you at once.  But it made all that\npart about the telephone fit in rather well.\"\n\n\"I should think it did, Bunny,\" murmured Raffles, in a tone that added\nsensibly to my reward.  \"I couldn't have done better myself, and you\nwill forgive my saying that you have never in your life done half so\nwell.  Talk about that crack you gave me on the head! You have made it\nup to me a hundredfold by all you have done to-night.  But the bother\nof it is that there's still so much to do, and to hit upon, and so\nprecious little time for thought as well as action.\"\n\nI took out my watch and showed it to Raffles without a word.  It was\nthree o'clock in the morning, and the latter end of March.  In little\nmore than an hour there would be dim daylight in the streets. Raffles\nroused himself from a reverie with sudden decision.\n\n\"There's only one thing for it, Bunny,\" said he.  \"We must trust each\nother and divide the labor.  You ring up the police, and leave the rest\nto me.\"\n\n\"You haven't hit upon any reason for the sort of burglar they think you\nwere, ringing up the kind of man they know I am?\"\n\n\"Not yet, Bunny, but I shall.  It may not be wanted for a day or so,\nand after all it isn't for you to give the explanation.  It would be\nhighly suspicious if you did.\"\n\n\"So it would,\" I agreed.\n\n\"Then will you trust me to hit on something--if possible before\nmorning--in any case by the time it's wanted?  I won't fail you, Bunny.\nYou must see how I can never, never fail you after to-night!\"\n\nThat settled it.  I gripped his hand without another word, and remained\non guard over the three sleepers while Raffles stole upstairs.  I have\nsince learned that there were servants at the top of the house, and in\nthe basement a man, who actually heard some of our proceedings!  But he\nwas mercifully too accustomed to nocturnal orgies, and those of a far\nmore uproarious character, to appear unless summoned to the scene.  I\nbelieve he heard Raffles leave.  But no secret was made of his exit: he\nlet himself out and told me afterward that the first person he\nencountered in the street was the constable on the beat.  Raffles\nwished him good-morning, as well he might; for he had been upstairs to\nwash his face and hands; and in the prize-fighter's great hat and fur\ncoat he might have marched round Scotland Yard itself, in spite of his\nhaving the gold brick from Sacramento in one pocket, the silver\nstatuette of Maguire in the other, and round his waist the jewelled\nbelt presented to that worthy by the State of Nevada.\n\nMy immediate part was a little hard after the excitement of those small\nhours.  I will only say that we had agreed that it would be wisest for\nme to lie like a log among the rest for half an hour, before staggering\nto my feet and rousing house and police; and that in that half-hour\nBarney Maguire crashed to the floor, without waking either himself or\nhis companions, though not without bringing my beating heart into the\nvery roof of my mouth.\n\nIt was daybreak when I gave the alarm with bell and telephone.  In a\nfew minutes we had the house congested with dishevelled domestics,\nirascible doctors, and arbitrary minions of the law.  If I told my\nstory once, I told it a dozen times, and all on an empty stomach. But\nit was certainly a most plausible and consistent tale, even without\nthat confirmation which none of the other victims was as yet\nsufficiently recovered to supply. And in the end I was permitted to\nretire from the scene until required to give further information, or to\nidentify the prisoner whom the good police confidently expected to make\nbefore the day was out.\n\nI drove straight to the flat.  The porter flew to help me out of my\nhansom.  His face alarmed me more than any I had left in Half-moon\nStreet.  It alone might have spelled my ruin.\n\n\"Your flat's been entered in the night, sir,\" he cried.  \"The thieves\nhave taken everything they could lay hands on.\"\n\n\"Thieves in my flat!\" I ejaculated aghast.  There were one or two\nincriminating possessions up there, as well as at the Albany.\n\n\"The door's been forced with a jimmy,\" said the porter.  \"It was the\nmilkman who found it out.  There's a constable up there now.\"\n\nA constable poking about in my flat of all others!  I rushed upstairs\nwithout waiting for the lift.  The invader was moistening his pencil\nbetween laborious notes in a fat pocketbook; he had penetrated no\nfurther than the forced door.  I dashed past him in a fever.  I kept my\ntrophies in a wardrobe drawer specially fitted with a Bramah lock.  The\nlock was broken--the drawer void.\n\n\"Something valuable, sir?\" inquired the intrusive constable at my heels.\n\n\"Yes, indeed--some old family silver,\" I answered.  It was quite true.\nBut the family was not mine.\n\nAnd not till then did the truth flash across my mind.  Nothing else of\nvalue had been taken.  But there was a meaningless litter in all the\nrooms.  I turned to the porter, who had followed me up from the street;\nit was his wife who looked after the flat.\n\n\"Get rid of this idiot as quick as you can,\" I whispered.  \"I'm going\nstraight to Scotland Yard myself.  Let your wife tidy the place while\nI'm gone, and have the lock mended before she leaves. I'm going as I\nam, this minute!\"\n\nAnd go I did, in the first hansom I could find--but not straight to\nScotland Yard.  I stopped the cab in Picadilly on the way.\n\nOld Raffles opened his own door to me.  I cannot remember finding him\nfresher, more immaculate, more delightful to behold in every way.\nCould I paint a picture of Raffles with something other than my pen, it\nwould be as I saw him that bright March morning, at his open door in\nthe Albany, a trim, slim figure in matutinal gray, cool and gay and\nbreezy as incarnate spring.\n\n\"What on earth did you do it for?\" I asked within.\n\n\"It was the only solution,\" he answered, handing me the cigarettes. \"I\nsaw it the moment I got outside.\"\n\n\"I don't see it yet.\"\n\n\"Why should a burglar call an innocent gentleman away from home?\"\n\n\"That's what we couldn't make out.\"\n\n\"I tell you I got it directly I had left you.  He called you away in\norder to burgle you too, of course!\"\n\nAnd Raffles stood smiling upon me in all his incomparable radiance and\naudacity.\n\n\"But why me?\" I asked.  \"Why on earth should he burgle me?\"\n\n\"My dear Bunny, we must leave something to the imagination of the\npolice.  But we will assist them to a fact or two in due season. It was\nthe dead of night when Maguire first took us to his house; it was at\nthe Imperial Boxing Club we met him; and you meet queer fish at the\nImperial Boxing Club.  You may remember that he telephoned to his man\nto prepare supper for us, and that you and he discussed telephones and\ntreasure as we marched through the midnight streets.  He was certainly\nbucking about his trophies, and for the sake of the argument you will\nbe good enough to admit that you probably bucked about yours.  What\nhappens?  You are overheard; you are followed; you are worked into the\nsame scheme, and robbed on the same night.\"\n\n\"And you really think this will meet the case?\"\n\n\"I am quite certain of it, Bunny, so far as it rests wit us to meet the\ncase at all.\"\n\n\"Then give me another cigarette, my dear fellow, and let me push on to\nScotland Yard.\"\n\nRaffles held up both hands in admiring horror.  \"Scotland Yard!\"\n\n\"To give a false description of what you took from that drawer in my\nwardrobe.\"\n\n\"A false description!  Bunny, you have no more to learn from me. Time\nwas when I wouldn't have let you go there without me to retrieve a lost\numbrella--let alone a lost cause!\"\n\nAnd for once I was not sorry for Raffles to have the last unworthy\nword, as he stood once more at his outer door and gayly waved me down\nthe stairs.\n\n\n\n\nThe Spoils of Sacrilege\n\nThere was one deed of those days which deserved a place in our original\nannals.  It is the deed of which I am personally most ashamed.  I have\ntraced the course of a score of felonies, from their source in the\nbrain of Raffles to their issue in his hands. I have omitted all\nmention of the one which emanated from my own miserable mind.  But in\nthese supplementary memoirs, wherein I pledged myself to extenuate\nnothing more that I might have to tell of Raffles, it is only fair that\nI should make as clean a breast of my own baseness.  It was I, then,\nand I alone, who outraged natural sentiment, and trampled the expiring\nembers of elementary decency, by proposing and planning the raid upon\nmy own old home.\n\nI would not accuse myself the more vehemently by making excuses at this\npoint.   Yet I feel bound to state that it was already many years since\nthe place had passed from our possession into that of an utter alien,\nagainst whom I harbored a prejudice which was some excuse in itself.\nHe had enlarged and altered the dear old place out of knowledge;\nnothing had been good enough for him as it stood in our day.  The man\nwas a hunting maniac, and where my dear father used to grow prize\npeaches under glass, this vandal was soon stabling his hothouse\nthoroughbreds, which took prizes in their turn at all the country\nshows.  It was a southern county, and I never went down there without\nmissing another greenhouse and noting a corresponding extension to the\nstables.  Not that I ever set foot in the grounds from the day we left;\nbut for some years I used to visit old friends in the neighborhood, and\ncould never resist the temptation to reconnoiter the scenes of my\nchildhood.  And so far as could be seen from the road--which it stood\ntoo near--the house itself appeared to be the one thing that the horsey\npurchaser had left much as he found it.\n\nMy only other excuse may be none at all in any eyes but mine.  It was\nmy passionate desire at this period to \"keep up my end\" with Raffles in\nevery department of the game felonious.  He would insist upon an equal\ndivision of all proceeds; it was for me to earn my share.  So far I had\nbeen useful only at a pinch; the whole credit of any real success\nbelonged invariably to Raffles.  It had always been his idea.  That was\nthe tradition which I sought to end, and no means could compare with\nthat of my unscrupulous choice.  There was the one house in England of\nwhich I knew every inch, and Raffles only what I told him.  For once I\nmust lead, and Raffles follow, whether he liked it or not.  He saw that\nhimself; and I think he liked it better than he liked me for the\ndesecration in view; but I had hardened my heart, and his feelings were\ntoo fine for actual remonstrance on such a point.\n\nI, in my obduracy, went to foul extremes.  I drew plans of all the\nfloors from memory.  I actually descended upon my friends in the\nneighborhood, with the sole object of obtaining snap-shots over our own\nold garden wall.  Even Raffles could not keep his eyebrows down when I\nshowed him the prints one morning in the Albany.  But he confined his\nopen criticisms to the house.\n\n\"Built in the late 'sixties, I see,\" said Raffles, \"or else very early\nin the 'seventies.\"\n\n\"Exactly when it was built,\" I replied.  \"But that's worthy of a\nsixpenny detective, Raffles!  How on earth did you know?\"\n\n\"That slate tower bang over the porch, with the dormer windows and the\niron railing and flagstaff atop makes us a present of the period. You\nsee them on almost every house of a certain size built about thirty\nyears ago.  They are quite the most useless excrescences I know.\"\n\n\"Ours wasn't,\" I answered, with some warmth.  \"It was my sanctum\nsanctorum in the holidays.  I smoked my first pipe up there, and wrote\nmy first verses.\"\n\nRaffles laid a kindly hand upon my shoulder--\"Bunny, Bunny, you can rob\nthe old place, and yet you can't hear a word against it?\"\n\n\"That's different,\" said I relentlessly.  \"The tower was there in my\ntime, but the man I mean to rob was not.\"\n\n\"You really do mean to do it, Bunny?\"\n\n\"By myself, if necessary?  I averred.\n\n\"Not again, Bunny, not again,\" rejoined Raffles, laughing as he shook\nhis head.  \"But do you think the man has enough to make it worth our\nwhile to go so far afield?\"\n\n\"Far afield!  It's not forty miles on the London and Brighton.\"\n\n\"Well, that's as bad as a hundred on most lines.  And when did you say\nit was to be?\"\n\n\"Friday week.\"\n\n\"I don't much like a Friday, Bunny.  Why make it one?\"\n\n\"It's the night of their Hunt Point-to-Point.  They wind up the season\nwith it every year; and the bloated Guillemard usually sweeps the board\nwith his fancy flyers.\"\n\n\"You mean the man in your old house?\"\n\n\"Yes; and he tops up with no end of dinner there,\" I went on, \"to his\nhunting pals and the bloods who ride for him.  If the festive board\ndoesn't groan under a new regiment of challenge cups, it will be no\nfault of theirs, and old Guillemard will have to do them top-hole all\nthe same.\"\n\n\"So it's a case of common pot-hunting,\" remarked Raffles, eyeing me\nshrewdly through the cigarette smoke.\n\n\"Not for us, my dear fellow,\" I made answer in his own tone.  \"I\nwouldn't ask you to break into the next set of chambers here in the\nAlbany for a few pieces of modern silver, Raffles.  Not that we need\nscorn the cups if we get a chance of lifting them, and if Guillemard\ndoes so in the first instance.  It's by no means certain that he will.\nBut it is pretty certain to be a lively night for him and his pals--and\na vulnerable one for the best bedroom!\"\n\n\"Capital!\" said Raffles, throwing coils of smoke between his smiles.\n\"Still, if it's a dinner-party, the hostess won't leave her jewels\nupstairs.  She'll wear them, my boy.\"\n\n\"Not all of them, Raffles; she has far too many for that.  Besides, it\nisn't an ordinary dinner-party; they say Mrs.  Guillemard is generally\nthe only lady there, and that she's quite charming in herself.  Now, no\ncharming woman would clap on all sail in jewels for a roomful of\nfox-hunters.\"\n\n\"It depends what jewels she has.\"\n\n\"Well, she might wear her rope of pearls.\"\n\n\"I should have said so.\"\n\n\"And, of course, her rings.\"\n\n\"Exactly, Bunny.\"\n\n\"But not necessarily her diamond tiara--\"\n\n\"Has she got one?\"\n\n\"--and certainly not her emerald and diamond necklace on top of all!\"\n\nRaffles snatched the Sullivan from his lips, and his eyes burned like\nits end.\n\n\"Bunny, do you mean to tell me there are all these things?\"\n\n\"Of course I do,\" said I.  \"They are rich people, and he's not such a\nbrute as to spend everything on his stable.  Her jewels are as much the\ntalk as his hunters.  My friends told me all about both the other day\nwhen I was down making inquiries.  They thought my curiosity as natural\nas my wish for a few snapshots of the old place.  In their opinion the\nemerald necklace alone must be worth thousands of pounds.\"\n\nRaffles rubbed his hands in playful pantomime.\n\n\"I only hope you didn't ask too many questions, Bunny!  But if your\nfriends are such old friends, you will never enter their heads when\nthey hear what has happened, unless you are seen down there on the\nnight, which might be fatal.  Your approach will require some thought:\nif you like I can work out the shot for you.  I shall go down\nindependently, and the best thing may be to meet outside the house\nitself on the night of nights.  But from that moment I am in your\nhands.\"\n\nAnd on these refreshing lines our plan of campaign was gradually\ndeveloped and elaborated into that finished study on which Raffles\nwould rely like any artist of the footlights.  None were more capable\nthan he of coping with the occasion as it rose, of rising himself with\nthe emergency of the moment, of snatching a victory from the very dust\nof defeat.  Yet, for choice, every detail was premeditated, and an\nalternative expedient at each finger's end for as many bare and awful\npossibilities.  In this case, however, the finished study stopped short\nat the garden gate or wall; there I was to assume command; and though\nRaffles carried the actual tools of trade of which he alone was master,\nit was on the understanding that for once I should control and direct\ntheir use.\n\nI had gone down in evening-clothes by an evening train, but had\ncarefully overshot old landmarks, and alighted at a small station some\nmiles south of the one where I was still remembered.  This committed me\nto a solitary and somewhat lengthy tramp; but the night was mild and\nstarry, and I marched into it with a high stomach; for this was to be\nno costume crime, and yet I should have Raffles at my elbow all the\nnight.  Long before I reached my destination, indeed, he stood in wait\nfor me on the white highway, and we finished with linked arms.\n\n\"I came down early,\" said Raffles, \"and had a look at the races.  I\nalways prefer to measure my man, Bunny; and you needn't sit in the\nfront row of the stalls to take stock of your friend Guillemard. No\nwonder he doesn't ride his own horses!  The steeple-chaser isn't foaled\nthat would carry him round that course.  But he's a fine monument of a\nman, and he takes his troubles in a way that makes me blush to add to\nthem.\"\n\n\"Did he lose a horse?\" I inquired cheerfully.\n\n\"No, Bunny, but he didn't win a race!  His horses were by chalks the\nbest there, and his pals rode them like the foul fiend, but with the\nworst of luck every time.  Not that you'd think it, from the row\nthey're making.  I've been listening to them from the road--you always\ndid say the house stood too near it.\"\n\n\"Then you didn't go in?\"\n\n\"When it's your show?  You should know me better.  Not a foot would I\nset on the premises behind your back.  But here they are, so perhaps\nyou'll lead the way.\"\n\nAnd I led it without a moment's hesitation, through the unpretentious\nsix-barred gate into the long but shallow crescent of the drive. There\nwere two such gates, one at each end of the drive, but no lodge at\neither, and not a light nearer than those of the house.  The shape and\naltitude of the lighted windows, the whisper of the laurels on either\nhand, the very feel of the gravel underfoot, were at once familiar to\nmy senses as the sweet, relaxing, immemorial air that one drank deeper\nat every breath.  Our stealthy advance was to me like stealing back\ninto one's childhood; and yet I could conduct it without compunction.\nI was too excited to feel immediate remorse, albeit not too lost in\nexcitement to know that remorse for every step that I was taking would\nbe my portion soon enough.  I mean every word that I have written of my\npeculiar shame for this night's work.  And it was all to come over me\nbefore the night was out.  But in the garden I never felt it once.\n\nThe dining-room windows blazed in the side of the house facing the\nroad.  That was an objection to peeping through the venetian blinds, as\nwe nevertheless did, at our peril of observation from the road. Raffles\nwould never have led me into danger so gratuitous and unnecessary, but\nhe followed me into it without a word.  I can only plead that we both\nhad our reward.  There was a sufficient chink in the obsolete\nvenetians, and through it we saw every inch of the picturesque board.\nMrs. Guillemard was still in her place, but she really was the only\nlady, and dressed as quietly as I had prophesied; round her neck was\nher rope of pearls, but not the glimmer of an emerald nor the glint of\na diamond, nor yet the flashing constellation of a tiara in her hair.\nI gripped Raffles in token of my triumph, and he nodded as he scanned\nthe overwhelming majority of flushed fox-hunters.  With the exception\nof one stripling, evidently the son of the house, they were in evening\npink to a man; and as I say, their faces matched their coats.  An\nenormous fellow, with a great red face and cropped moustache, occupied\nmy poor father's place; he it was who had replaced our fruitful\nvineries with his stinking stables; but I am bound to own he looked a\ngenial clod, as he sat in his fat and listened to the young bloods\nboasting of their prowess, or elaborately explaining their mishaps.\nAnd for a minute we listened also, before I remembered my\nresponsibilities, and led Raffles round to the back of the house.\n\nThere never was an easier house to enter.  I used to feel that keenly\nas a boy, when, by a prophetic irony, burglars were my bugbear, and I\nlooked under my bed every night in life.  The bow-windows on the ground\nfloor finished in inane balconies to the first-floor windows.  These\nbalconies had ornamental iron railings, to which a less ingenious\nrope-ladder than ours could have been hitched with equal ease.  Raffles\nhad brought it with him, round his waist, and he carried the telescopic\nstick for fixing it in place.  The one was unwound, and the other put\ntogether, in a secluded corner of the red-brick walls, where of old I\nhad played my own game of squash-rackets in the holidays.  I made\nfurther investigations in the starlight, and even found a trace of my\noriginal white line along the red wall.\n\nBut it was not until we had effected our entry through the room which\nhad been my very own, and made our parlous way across the lighted\nlanding, to the best bedroom of those days and these, that I really\nfelt myself a worm.  Twin brass bedsteads occupied the site of the old\nfour-poster from which I had first beheld the light.  The doors were\nthe same; my childish hands had grasped these very handles.  And there\nwas Raffles securing the landing door with wedge and gimlet, the very\nsecond after softly closing it behind us.\n\n\"The other leads into the dressing-room, of course?  Then you might be\nfixing the outer dressing-room door,\" he whispered at his work, \"but\nnot the middle one Bunny, unless you want to.  The stuff will be in\nthere, you see, if it isn't in here.\"\n\nMy door was done in a moment, being fitted with a powerful bolt; but\nnow an aching conscience made me busier than I need have been. I had\nraised the rope-ladder after us into my own old room, and while Raffles\nwedged his door I lowered the ladder from one of the best bedroom\nwindows, in order to prepare that way of escape which was a fundamental\nfeature of his own strategy.  I meant to show Raffles that I had not\nfollowed in his train for nothing.  But I left it to him to unearth the\njewels.  I had begun by turning up the gas; there appeared to be no\npossible risk in that; and Raffles went to work with a will in the\nexcellent light.  There were some good pieces in the room, including an\nancient tallboy in fruity mahogany, every drawer of which was turned\nout on the bed without avail.  A few of the drawers had locks to pick,\nyet not one triffle to our taste within.  The situation became serious\nas the minutes flew.  We had left the party at its sweets; the solitary\nlady might be free to roam her house at any minute.  In the end we\nturned our attention to the dressing-room.  And no sooner did Raffles\nbehold the bolted door than up went his hands.\n\n\"A bathroom bolt,\" he cried below his breath, \"and no bath in the room!\nWhy didn't you tell me, Bunny?  A bolt like that speaks volumes;\nthere's none on the bedroom door, remember, and this one's worthy of a\nstrong room!  What if it is their strong room, Bunny! Oh, Bunny, what\nif this is their safe?\"\n\nRaffles had dropped upon his knees before a carved oak chest of\nindisputable antiquity.  Its panels were delightfully irregular, its\nangles faultlessly faulty, its one modern defilement a strong lock to\nthe lid.  Raffles was smiling as he produced his jimmy. R--r--r--rip\nwent lock or lid in another ten seconds--I was not there to see which.\nI had wandered back into the bedroom in a paroxysm of excitement and\nsuspense.  I must keep busy as well as Raffles, and it was not too\nsoon to see whether the rope-ladder was all right.  In another minute...\n\nI stood frozen to the floor.  I had hooked the ladder beautifully to\nthe inner sill of wood, and had also let down the extended rod for the\nmore expeditious removal of both on our return to terra firma.\nConceive my cold horror on arriving at the open window just in time to\nsee the last of hooks and bending rod, as they floated out of sight and\nreach into the outer darkness of the night, removed by some silent and\ninvisible hand below!\n\n\"Raffles-Raffles--they've spotted us and moved the ladder this very\ninstant!\"\n\nSo I panted as I rushed on tiptoe to the dressing-room.  Raffles had\nthe working end of his jimmy under the lid of a leathern jewel case. It\nflew open at the vicious twist of his wrist that preceded his reply.\n\n\"Did you let them see that you'd spotted that?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Good!  Pocket some of these cases--no time to open them.  Which door's\nnearest the backstairs?\"\n\n\"The other.\"\n\n\"Come on then?\"\n\n\"No, no, I'll lead the way.  I know every inch of it.\"\n\nAnd, as I leaned against the bedroom door, handle in hand, while\nRaffles stooped to unscrew the gimlet and withdraw the wedge, I hit\nupon the ideal port in the storm that was evidently about to burst on\nour devoted heads.  It was the last place in which they would look for\na couple of expert cracksmen with no previous knowledge of the house.\nIf only we could gain my haven unobserved, there we might lie in\nunsuspected hiding, and by the hour, if not for days and nights.\n\nAlas for that sanguine dream!  The wedge was out, and Raffles on his\nfeet behind me.  I opened the door, and for a second the pair of us\nstood upon the threshold.\n\nCreeping up the stairs before us, each on the tip of his silken toes,\nwas a serried file of pink barbarians, redder in the face than anywhere\nelse, and armed with crops carried by the wrong end. The monumental\nperson with the short moustache led the advance.  The fool stood still\nupon the top step to let out the loudest and cheeriest view-holloa that\never smote my ears.\n\nIt cost him more than he may know until I tell him.  There was the wide\npart of the landing between us; we had just that much start along the\nnarrow part, with the walls and doors upon our left, the banisters on\nour right, and the baize door at the end.  But if the great Guillemard\nhad not stopped to live up to his sporting reputation, he would\nassuredly have laid one or other of us by the heels, and either would\nhave been tantamount to both.  As I gave Raffles a headlong lead to the\nbaize door, I glanced down the great well of stairs, and up came the\ndaft yells of these sporting oafs:\n\n\"Gone away--gone away!\"\n\n\"Yoick--yoick--yoick?\"\n\n\"Yon-der they go?\"\n\nAnd gone I had, through the baize door to the back landing, with\nRaffles at my heels.  I held the swing door for him, and heard him bang\nit in the face of the spluttering and blustering master of the house.\nOther feet were already in the lower flight of the backstairs; but the\nupper flight was the one for me, and in an instant we were racing along\nthe upper corridor with the chuckle-headed pack at our heels.  Here it\nwas all but dark--they were the servants' bedrooms that we were passing\nnow--but I knew what I was doing.  Round the last corner to the right,\nthrough the first door to the left and we were in the room underneath\nthe tower. In our time a long stepladder had led to the tower itself.\nI rushed in the dark to the old corner.  Thank God, the ladder was\nthere still!  It leaped under us as we rushed aloft like one quadruped.\nThe breakneck trap-door was still protected by a curved brass\nstanchion; this I grasped with one hand, and then Raffles with the\nother as I felt my feet firm upon the tower floor.  In he sprawled\nafter me, and down went the trap-door with a bang upon the leading\nhound.\n\nI hoped to feel his dead-weight shake the house, as he crashed upon the\nfloor below; but the fellow must have ducked, and no crash came.\nMeanwhile not a word passed between Raffles and me; he had followed me,\nas I had led him, without waste of breath upon a single syllable. But\nthe merry lot below were still yelling and bellowing in full cry.\n\n\"Gone to ground?  screamed one.\n\n\"Where's the terrier?\" screeched another.\n\nBut their host of the mighty girth--a man like a soda-water bottle,\nfrom my one glimpse of him on his feet--seemed sobered rather than\nstunned by the crack on that head of his.  We heard his fine voice no\nmore, but we could feel him straining every thew against the trap-door\nupon which Raffles and I stood side by side.  At least I thought\nRaffles was standing, until he asked me to strike a light, when I found\nhim on his knees instead of on his feet, busy screwing down the\ntrap-door with his gimlet.  He carried three or four gimlets for\nwedging doors, and he drove them all in to the handle, while I pulled\nat the stanchion and pushed with my feet.\n\nBut the upward pressure ceased before our efforts.  We heard the ladder\ncreak again under a ponderous and slow descent; and we stood upright in\nthe dim flicker of a candle-end that I had lit and left burning on the\nfloor.  Raffles glanced at the four small windows in turn and then at\nme.  \"Is there any way out at all?\" he whispered, as no other being\nwould or could have whispered to the man who had led him into such a\ntrap.  \"We've no rope-ladder, you know.\"\n\n\"Thanks to me,\" I groaned.  \"The whole thing's my fault?\n\n\"Nonsense, Bunny; there was no other way to run.  But what about these\nwindows?\"\n\nHis magnanimity took me by the throat; without a word I led him to the\none window looking inward upon sloping slates and level leads. Often as\na boy I had clambered over them, for the fearful fun of risking life\nand limb, or the fascination of peering through the great square\nskylight, down the well of the house into the hall below.  There were,\nhowever, several smaller skylights, for the benefit of the top floor,\nthrough any one of which I thought we might have made a dash.  But at a\nglance I saw we were too late: one of these skylights became a\nbrilliant square before our eyes; opened, and admitted a flushed face\non flaming shoulders.\n\n\"I'll give them a fright!\"  said Raffles through his teeth.  In an\ninstant he had plucked out his revolver, smashed the window with its\nbutt, and the slates with a bullet not a yard from the protruding head.\nAnd that, I believe, was the only shot that Raffles ever fired in his\nwhole career as a midnight marauder.\n\n\"You didn't hit him?\" I gasped, as the head disappeared, and we heard a\ncrash in the corridor.\n\n\"Of course I didn't, Bunny,\" he replied, backing into the tower; \"but\nno one will believe I didn't mean to, and it'll stick on ten years if\nwe're caught.  That's nothing, if it gives us an extra five minutes\nnow, while they hold a council of war.  Is that a working flag-staff\noverhead?\"\n\n\"It used to be.\"\n\n\"Then there'll be halliards.\"\n\n\"They were as thin as clothes-lines.\".\n\n\"And they're sure to be rotten, and we should be seen cutting them\ndown.  No, Bunny, that won't do.  Wait a bit.  Is there a lightning\nconductor?\"\n\n\"There was.\"\n\nI opened one of the side windows and reached out as far as I could.\n\n\"You'll be seen from that skylight!\" cried Raffles in a warning\nundertone.\n\n\"No, I won't.  I can't see it myself.  But here's the\nlightning-conductor, where it always was.\"\n\n\"How thick,\" asked Raffles, as I drew in and rejoined him.\n\n\"Rather thicker than a lead-pencil.\"\n\n\"They sometimes bear you,\" said Raffles, slipping on a pair of white\nkid gloves, and stuffing his handkerchief into the palm of one. \"The\ndifficulty is to keep a grip; but I've been up and down them before\nto-night.  And it's our only chance.  I'll go first, Bunny: you watch\nme, and do exactly as I do if I get down all right.\"\n\n\"But if you don't?\"\n\n\"If I don't,\" whispered Raffles, as he wormed through the window feet\nforemost, \"I'm afraid you'll have to face the music where you are, and\nI shall have the best of it down in Acheron!\"\n\nAnd he slid out of reach without another word, leaving me to shudder\nalike at his levity and his peril; nor could I follow him very far by\nthe wan light of the April stars; but I saw his forearms resting a\nmoment in the spout that ran around the tower, between bricks and\nslates, on the level of the floor; and I had another dim glimpse of him\nlower still, on the eaves over the very room that we had ransacked.\nThence the conductor ran straight to earth in an angle of the facade.\nAnd since it had borne him thus far without mishap, I felt that Raffles\nwas as good as down.  But I had neither his muscles nor his nerves, and\nmy head swam as I mounted to the window and prepared to creep out\nbackward in my turn.\n\nSo it was that at the last moment I had my first unobstructed view of\nthe little old tower of other days.  Raffles was out of the way; the\nbit of candle was still burning on the floor, and in its dim light the\nfamiliar haunt was cruelly like itself of innocent memory. A lesser\nladder still ascended to a tinier trap-door in the apex of the tower;\nthe fixed seats looked to me to be wearing their old, old coat of\ngrained varnish; nay the varnish had its ancient smell, and the very\nvanes outside creaked their message to my ears.  I remembered whole\ndays that I had spent, whole books that I had read, here in this\nfavorite fastness of my boyhood.  The dirty little place, with the\ndormer window in each of its four sloping sides, became a gallery hung\nwith poignant pictures of the past.  And here was I leaving it with my\nlife in my hands and my pockets full of stolen jewels!  A superstition\nseized me.  Suppose the conductor came down with me ...  suppose I\nslipped ... and was picked up dead, with the proceeds of my shameful\ncrime upon me, under the very windows\n\n  ...where the sun\n  Came peeping in at dawn...\n\nI hardly remember what I did or left undone.  I only know that nothing\nbroke, that somehow I kept my hold, and that in the end the wire ran\nred-hot through my palms so that both were torn and bleeding when I\nstood panting beside Raffles in the flower-beds. There was no time for\nthinking then.  Already there was a fresh commotion in-doors; the tidal\nwave of excitement which had swept all before it to the upper regions\nwas subsiding in as swift a rush downstairs; and I raced after Raffles\nalong the edge of the drive without daring to look behind.\n\nWe came out by the opposite gate to that by which we had stolen in.\nSharp to the right ran the private lane behind the stables and sharp to\nthe right dashed Raffles, instead of straight along the open road.  It\nwas not the course I should have chosen, but I followed Raffles without\na murmur, only too thankful that he had assumed the lead at last.\nAlready the stables were lit up like a chandelier; there was a staccato\nrattle of horseshoes in the stable yard, and the great gates were\nopening as we skimmed past in the nick of time.  In another minute we\nwere skulking in the shadow of the kitchen-garden wall while the\nhigh-road rang with the dying tattoo of galloping hoofs.\n\n\"That's for the police,\" said Raffles, waiting for me.  \"But the fun's\nonly beginning in the stables.  Hear the uproar, and see the lights!\nIn another minute they'll be turning out the hunters for the last run\nof the season.\"\n\n\"We mustn't give them one, Raffles?\"\n\n\"Of course we mustn't; but that means stopping where we are.\"\n\n\"We can't do that?\"\n\n\"If they're wise they'll send a man to every railway station within ten\nmiles and draw every cover inside the radius.  I can only think of one\nthat's not likely to occur to them.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"The other side of this wall.  How big is the garden, Bunny?\"\n\n\"Six or seven acres.\"\n\n\"Well, you must take me to another of your old haunts, where we can lie\nlow till morning.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Sufficient for the night, Bunny!  The first thing is to find a burrow.\nWhat are those trees at the end of this lane?\"\n\n\"St. Leonard's Forest.\"\n\n\"Magnificent!  They'll scour every inch of that before they come back\nto their own garden.  Come, Bunny, give me a leg up, and I'll pull you\nafter me in two ticks!\"\n\nThere was indeed nothing better to be done; and, much as I loathed and\ndreaded entering the place again, I had already thought of a second\nsanctuary of old days, which might as well be put to the base uses of\nthis disgraceful night.  In a far corner of the garden, over a hundred\nyards from the house, a little ornamental lake had been dug within my\nown memory; its shores were shelving lawn and steep banks of\nrhododendrons; and among the rhododendrons nestled a tiny boathouse\nwhich had been my childish joy.  It was half a dock for the dingy in\nwhich one plowed these miniature waters and half a bathing-box for\nthose who preferred their morning tub among the goldfish.  I could not\nthink of a safer asylum than this, if we must spend the night upon the\npremises; and Raffles agreed with me when I had led him by sheltering\nshrubbery and perilous lawn to the diminutive chalet between the\nrhododendrons and the water.\n\nBut what a night it was!  The little bathing-box had two doors, one to\nthe water, the other to the path.  To hear all that could be heard, it\nwas necessary to keep both doors open, and quite imperative not to\ntalk.  The damp night air of April filled the place, and crept through\nour evening clothes and light overcoats into the very marrow; the\nmental torture of the situation was renewed and multiplied in my brain;\nand all the time one's ears were pricked for footsteps on the path\nbetween the rhododendrons. The only sounds we could at first identify\ncame one and all from the stables.  Yet there the excitement subsided\nsooner than we had expected, and it was Raffles himself who breathed a\ndoubt as to whether they were turning out the hunters after all.  On\nthe other hand, we heard wheels in the drive not long after midnight;\nand Raffles, who was beginning to scout among the shrubberies, stole\nback to tell me that the guests were departing, and being sped, with an\nunimpaired conviviality which he failed to understand. I said I could\nnot understand it either, but suggested the general influence of\nliquor, and expressed my envy of their state.  I had drawn my knees up\nto my chin, on the bench where one used to dry one's self after\nbathing, and there I sat in a seeming stolidity at utter variance with\nmy inward temper.  I heard Raffles creep forth again and I let him go\nwithout a word.  I never doubted that he would be back again in a\nminute, and so let many minutes elapse before I realized his continued\nabsence, and finally crept out myself to look for him.\n\nEven then I only supposed that he had posted himself outside in some\nmore commanding position.  I took a catlike stride and breathed his\nname.  There was no answer.  I ventured further, till I could overlook\nthe lawns: they lay like clean slates in the starlight: there was no\nsign of living thing nearer than the house, which was still lit up, but\nquiet enough now.  Was it a cunning and deliberate quiet assumed as a\nsnare?  Had they caught Raffles, and were they waiting for me?  I\nreturned to the boat-house in an agony of fear and indignation.  It was\nfear for the long hours that I sat there waiting for him; it was\nindignation when at last I heard his stealthy step upon the gravel.  I\nwould not go out to meet him.  I sat where I was while the stealthy\nstep came nearer, nearer; and there I was sitting when the door opened,\nand a huge man in riding-clothes stood before me in the steely dawn.\n\nI leaped to my feet, and the huge man clapped me playfully on the\nshoulder.\n\n\"Sorry I've been so long, Bunny, but we should never have got away as\nwe were; this riding-suit makes a new man of me, on top of my own, and\nhere's a youth's kit that should do you down to the ground.\"\n\n\"So you broke into the house again?\n\n\"I was obliged to, Bunny; but I had to watch the lights out one by one,\nand give them a good hour after that I went through that dressing room\nat my leisure this time; the only difficulty was to spot the son's\nquarters at the back of the house; but I overcame it, as you see, in\nthe end.  I only hope they'll fit, Bunny.  Give me your patent\nleathers, and I'll fill them with stones and sink them in the pond.\nI'm doing the same with mine.  Here's a brown pair apiece, and we\nmustn't let the grass grow under them if we're to get to the station in\ntime for the early train while the coast's still clear.\"\n\nThe early train leaves the station in question at 6.20 A.M.; and that\nfine spring morning there was a police officer in a peaked cap to see\nit off; but he was too busy peering into the compartments for a pair of\nvery swell mobsmen that he took no notice of the huge man in\nriding-clothes, who was obviously intoxicated, or the more\ninsignificant but not less horsy character who had him in hand.  The\nearly train is due at Victoria at 8.28, but these worthies left it at\nClapham Junction, and changed cabs more than once between Battersea and\nPiccadilly, and a few of their garments in each four-wheeler.  It was\nbarely nine o'clock when they sat together in the Albany, and might\nhave been recognized once more as Raffles and myself.\n\n\"And now,\" said Raffles, \"before we do anything else, let us turn out\nthose little cases that we hadn't time to open when we took them.  I\nmean the ones I handed to you, Bunny.  I had a look into mine in the\ngarden, and I'm sorry to say there was nothing in them. The lady must\nhave been wearing their proper contents.\"\n\nRaffles held out his hand for the substantial leather cases which I had\nproduced at his request.  But that was the extent of my compliance;\ninstead of handing them over, I looked boldly into the eyes that seemed\nto have discerned my wretched secret at one glance.\n\n\"It is no use my giving them to you,\" I said.  \"They are empty also.\"\n\n\"When did you look into them?\"\n\n\"In the tower.\"\n\n\"Well, let me see for myself.\"\n\n\"As you like.\"\n\n\"My dear Bunny, this one must have contained the necklace you boasted\nabout.\"\n\n\"Very likely.\"\n\n\"And this one the tiara.\"\n\n\"I dare say.\"\n\n\"Yet she was wearing neither, as you prophesied, and as we both saw for\nourselves.\"\n\nI had not taken my eyes from his.\n\n\"Raffles,\" I said, \"I'll be frank with you after all.  I meant you\nnever to know, but it's easier than telling you a lie.  I left both\nthings behind me in the tower.  I won't attempt to explain or defend\nmyself; it was probably the influence of the tower, and nothing else;\nbut the whole thing came over me at the last moment, when you had gone\nand I was going.  I felt that I should very probably break my neck,\nthat I cared very little whether I did or not, but that it would be\nfrightful to break it at that house with those things in my pocket.\nYou may say I ought to have thought of all that before! you may say\nwhat you like, and you won't say more than I deserve. It was\nhysterical, and it was mean, for I kept the cases to impose on you.\"\n\n\"You were always a bad liar, Bunny,\" said Raffles, smiling.  \"Will you\nthink me one when I tell you that I can understand what you felt, and\neven what you did?  As a matter of fact, I have understood for several\nhours now.\"\n\n\"You mean what I felt, Raffles?\"\n\n\"And what you did.  I guessed it in the boathouse.  I knew that\nsomething must have happened or been discovered to disperse that\ntruculent party of sportsmen so soon and on such good terms with\nthemselves.  They had not got us; they might have got something better\nworth having; and your phlegmatic attitude suggested what. As luck\nwould have it, the cases that I personally had collared were the empty\nones; the two prizes had fallen to you.  Well, to allay my horrid\nsuspicion, I went and had another peep through the lighted venetians.\nAnd what do you think I saw?\"\n\nI shook my head.  I had no idea, nor was I very eager for enlightenment.\n\n\"The two poor people whom it was your own idea to despoil,\" quoth\nRaffles, \"prematurely gloating over these two pretty things?\"\n\nHe withdrew a hand from either pocket of his crumpled dinner-jacket,\nand opened the pair under my nose.  In one was a diamond tiara, and in\nthe other a necklace of fine emeralds set in clusters of brilliants.\n\n\"You must try to forgive me, Bunny,\" continued Raffles before I could\nspeak.  \"I don't say a word against what you did, or undid; in fact,\nnow it's all over, I am rather glad to think that you did try to undo\nit.  But, my dear fellow, we had both risked life, limb, and liberty;\nand I had not your sentimental scruples.  Why should I go empty away?\nIf you want to know the inner history of my second visit to that good\nfellow's dressing-room, drive home for a fresh kit and meet me at the\nTurkish bath in twenty minutes. I feel more than a little grubby, and\nwe can have our breakfast in the cooling gallery.  Besides, after a\nwhole night in your old haunts, Bunny, it's only in order to wind up in\nNorthumberland Avenue.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Raffles Relics\n\nIt was in one of the magazines for December, 1899, that an article\nappeared which afforded our minds a brief respite from the then\nconsuming excitement of the war in South Africa.  These were the days\nwhen Raffles really had white hair, and when he and I were nearing the\nend of our surreptitious second innings, as professional cracksmen of\nthe deadliest dye.  Piccadilly and the Albany knew us no more.  But we\nstill operated, as the spirit tempted us, from our latest and most\nidyllic base, on the borders of Ham Common.  Recreation was our\ngreatest want; and though we had both descended to the humble bicycle,\na lot of reading was forced upon us in the winter evenings.  Thus the\nwar came as a boon to us both.  It not only provided us with an honest\ninterest in life, but gave point and zest to innumerable spins across\nRichmond Park, to the nearest paper shop; and it was from such an\nexpedition that I returned with inflammatory matter unconnected with\nthe war.  The magazine was one of those that are read (and sold) by the\nmillion; the article was rudely illustrated on every other page.  Its\nsubject was the so-called Black Museum at Scotland Yard; and from the\ncatchpenny text we first learned that the gruesome show was now\nenriched by a special and elaborate exhibit known as the Raffles Relics.\n\n\"Bunny,\" said Raffles, \"this is fame at last!  It is no longer\nnotoriety; it lifts one out of the ruck of robbers into the society of\nthe big brass gods, whose little delinquencies are written in water by\nthe finger of time.  The Napoleon Relics we know, the Nelson Relics\nwe've heard about, and here are mine!\"\n\n\"Which I wish to goodness we could see,\" I added, longingly.  Next\nmoment I was sorry I had spoken.  Raffles was looking at me across the\nmagazine.  There was a smile on his lips that I knew too well, a light\nin his eyes that I had kindled.\n\n\"What an excellent idea?  he exclaimed, quite softly, as though working\nit out already in his brain.\n\n\"I didn't mean it for one,\" I answered, \"and no more do you.\"\n\n\"Certainly I do,\" said Raffles.  \"I was never more serious in my life.\"\n\n\"You would march into Scotland Yard in broad daylight?\"\n\n\"In broad lime-light,\" he answered, studying the magazine again, \"to\nset eyes on my own once more.  Why here they all are, Bunny--you never\ntold me there was an illustration.  That's the chest you took to your\nbank with me inside, and those must be my own rope-ladder and things on\ntop.  They produce so badly in the baser magazines that it's impossible\nto swear to them; there's nothing for it but a visit of inspection.\"\n\n\"Then you can pay it alone,\" said I grimly.  \"You may have altered, but\nthey'd know me at a glance.\"\n\n\"By all means, Bunny, if you'll get me the pass.\"\n\n\"A pass?\" I cried triumphantly.  \"Of course we should have to get one,\nand of course that puts an end to the whole idea.  Who on earth would\ngive a pass for this show, of all others, to an old prisoner like me?\"\n\nRaffles addressed himself to the reading of the magazine with a shrug\nthat showed some temper.\n\n\"The fellow who wrote this article got one,\" said he shortly.  \"He got\nit from his editor, and you can get one from yours if you tried. But\npray don't try, Bunny: it would be too terrible for you to risk a\nmoment's embarrassment to gratify a mere whim of mine.  And if I went\ninstead of you and got spotted, which is so likely with this head of\nhair, and the general belief in my demise, the consequences to you\nwould be too awful to contemplate!  Don't contemplate them, my dear\nfellow.  And do let me read my magazine.\"\n\nNeed I add that I set about the rash endeavor without further\nexpostulation?  I was used to such ebullitions from the altered Raffles\nof these later days, and I could well understand them.  All the\ninconvenience of the new conditions fell on him.  I had purged my known\noffences by imprisonment, whereas Raffles was merely supposed to have\nescaped punishment in death.  The result was that I could rush in where\nRaffles feared to tread, and was his plenipotentiary in all honest\ndealings with the outer world.  It could not but gall him to be so\ndependent upon me, and it was for me to minimize the humiliation by\nscrupulously avoiding the least semblance of an abuse of that power\nwhich I now had over him. Accordingly, though with much misgiving, I\ndid his ticklish behest in Fleet Street, where, despite my past, I was\nalready making a certain lowly footing for myself.  Success followed as\nit will when one longs to fail; and one fine evening I returned to Ham\nCommon with a card from the Convict Supervision Office, New Scotland\nYard, which I treasure to this day.  I am surprised to see that it was\nundated, and might still almost \"Admit Bearer to see the Museum,\" to\nsay nothing of the bearer's friends, since my editor's name \"and party\"\nis scrawled beneath the legend.\n\n\"But he doesn't want to come,\" as I explained to Raffles.  \"And it\nmeans that we can both go, if we both like.\"\n\nRaffles looked at me with a wry smile; he was in good enough humor now.\n\n\"It would be rather dangerous, Bunny.  If they spotted you, they might\nthink of me.\"\n\n\"But you say they'll never know you now.\"\n\n\"I don't believe they will.  I don't believe there's the slightest\nrisk; but we shall soon see.  I've set my heart on seeing, Bunny, but\nthere's no earthly reason why I should drag you into it.\"\n\n\"You do that when you present this card,\" I pointed out.  \"I shall hear\nof it fast enough if anything happens.\"\n\n\"Then you may as well be there to see the fun?\"\n\n\"It will make no difference if the worst comes to the worst.\"\n\n\"And the ticket is for a party, isn't it?\"\n\n\"It is.\"\n\n\"It might even look peculiar if only one person made use of it?\"\n\n\"It might.\"\n\n\"Then we're both going, Bunny!  And I give you my word,\" cried Raffles,\n\"that no real harm shall come of it.  But you mustn't ask to see the\nRelics, and you mustn't take too much interest in them when you do see\nthem.  Leave the questioning to me: it really will be a chance of\nfinding out whether they've any suspicion of one's resurrection at\nScotland Yard.  Still I think I can promise you a certain amount of\nfun, old fellow, as some little compensation for your pangs and fears?\"\n\nThe early afternoon was mild and hazy, and unlike winter but for the\nprematurely low sun struggling through the haze, as Raffles and I\nemerged from the nether regions at Westminster Bridge, and stood for\none moment to admire the infirm silhouettes of Abbey and Houses in flat\ngray against a golden mist.  Raffles murmured of Whistler and of Arthur\nSevern, and threw away a good Sullivan because the smoke would curl\nbetween him and the picture.  It is perhaps the picture that I can now\nsee clearest of all the set scenes of our lawless life.  But at the\ntime I was filled with gloomy speculation as to whether Raffles would\nkeep his promise of providing an entirely harmless entertainment for my\nbenefit at the Black Museum.\n\nWe entered the forbidding precincts; we looked relentless officers in\nthe face, and they almost yawned in ours as they directed us through\nswing doors and up stone stairs.  There was something even sinister in\nthe casual character of our reception.  We had an arctic landing to\nourselves for several minutes, which Raffles spent in an instinctive\nsurvey of the premises, while I cooled my heels before the portrait of\na late commissioner.\n\n\"Dear old gentleman!\" exclaimed Raffles, joining me.  \"I have met him\nat dinner, and discussed my own case with him, in the old days. But we\ncan't know too little about ourselves in the Black Museum, Bunny.  I\nremember going to the old place in Whitehall, years ago, and being\nshown round by one of the tip-top 'tecs.  And this may be another.\"\n\nBut even I could see at a glance that there was nothing of the\ndetective and everything of the clerk about the very young man who had\njoined us at last upon the landing.  His collar was the tallest I have\never seen, and his face was as pallid as his collar.  He carried a\nloose key, with which he unlocked a door a little way along the\npassage, and so ushered us into that dreadful repository which perhaps\nhas fewer visitors than any other of equal interest in the world.  The\nplace was cold as the inviolate vault; blinds had to be drawn up, and\nglass cases uncovered, before we could see a thing except the row of\nmurderers' death-masks--the placid faces with the swollen necks--that\nstood out on their shelves to give us ghostly greeting.\n\n\"This fellow isn't formidable,\" whispered Raffles, as the blinds went\nup; \"still, we can't be too careful.  My little lot are round the\ncorner, in the sort of recess; don't look till we come to them in their\nturn.\"\n\nSo we began at the beginning, with the glass case nearest the door; and\nin a moment I discovered that I knew far more about its contents than\nour pallid guide.  He had some enthusiasm, but the most inaccurate\nsmattering of his subject.  He mixed up the first murderer with quite\nthe wrong murder, and capped his mistake in the next breath with an\nintolerable libel on the very pearl of our particular tribe.\n\n\"This revawlver,\" he began, \"belonged to the celebrited burgular,\nChawles Peace.  These are his spectacles, that's his jimmy, and this\nhere knife's the one that Chawley killed the policeman with.\"\n\nNow I like accuracy for its own sake, strive after it myself, and am\nsometimes guilty of forcing it upon others.  So this was more than I\ncould pass.\n\n\"That's not quite right,\" I put in mildly.  \"He never made use of the\nknife.\"\n\nThe young clerk twisted his head round in its vase of starch.\n\n\"Chawley Peace killed two policemen,\" said he.\n\n\"No, he didn't; only one of them was a policeman; and he never killed\nanybody with a knife.\"\n\nThe clerk took the correction like a lamb.  I could not have refrained\nfrom making it, to save my skin.  But Raffles rewarded me with as\nvicious a little kick as he could administer unobserved. \"Who was\nCharles Peace?\" he inquired, with the bland effrontery of any judge\nupon the bench.\n\nThe clerk's reply came pat and unexpected.  \"The greatest burgular we\never had,\" said he, \"till good old Raffles knocked him out!\"\n\n\"The greatest of the pre-Raffleites,\" the master murmured, as we passed\non to the safer memorials of mere murder.  There were misshapen bullets\nand stained knives that had taken human life; there were lithe, lean\nropes which had retaliated after the live letter of the Mosaic law.\nThere was one bristling broadside of revolvers under the longest shelf\nof closed eyes and swollen throats. There were festoons of\nrope-ladders--none so ingenious as ours--and then at last there was\nsomething that the clerk knew all about. It was a small tin\ncigarette-box, and the name upon the gaudy wrapper was not the name of\nSullivan.  Yet Raffles and I knew even more about this exhibit than the\nclerk.\n\n\"There, now,\" said our guide, \"you'll never guess the history of that!\nI'll give you twenty guesses, and the twentieth will be no nearer than\nthe first.\"\n\n\"I'm sure of it, my good fellow,\" rejoined Raffles, a discreet twinkle\nin his eye.  \"Tell us about it, to save time.\"\n\nAnd he opened, as he spoke, his own old twenty-five tin of purely\npopular cigarettes; there were a few in it still, but between the\ncigarettes were jammed lumps of sugar wadded with cotton-wool.  I saw\nRaffles weighing the lot in his hand with subtle satisfaction. But the\nclerk saw merely the mystification which he desired to create.\n\n\"I thought that'd beat you, sir,\" said he.  \"It was an American dodge.\nTwo smart Yankees got a jeweller to take a lot of stuff to a private\nroom at Keliner's, where they were dining, for them to choose from.\nWhen it came to paying, there was some bother about a remittance; but\nthey soon made that all right, for they were far too clever to suggest\ntaking away what they'd chosen but couldn't pay for.  No, all they\nwanted was that what they'd chosen might be locked up in the safe and\nconsidered theirs until their money came for them to pay for it.  All\nthey asked was to seal the stuff up in something; the jeweller was to\ntake it away and not meddle with it, nor yet break the seals, for a\nweek or two.  It seemed a fair enough thing, now, didn't it, sir?\"\n\n\"Eminently fair,\" said Raffles sententiously.\n\n\"So the jeweller thought,\" crowed the clerk.  \"You see, it wasn't as if\nthe Yanks had chosen out the half of what he'd brought on appro.;\nthey'd gone slow on purpose, and they'd paid for all they could on the\nnail, just for a blind.  Well, I suppose you can guess what happened in\nthe end?  The jeweller never heard of those Americans again; and these\nfew cigarettes and lumps of sugar were all he found.\"\n\n\"Duplicate boxes?  I cried, perhaps a thought too promptly.\n\n\"Duplicate boxes!\" murmured Raffles, as profoundly impressed as a\nsecond Mr. Pickwick.\n\n\"Duplicate boxes!\" echoed the triumphant clerk.  \"Artful beggars, these\nAmericans, sir!  You've got to crawss the 'Erring Pond to learn a trick\nworth one o' that?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" assented the grave gentleman wit the silver hair.\n\"Unless,\" he added, as if suddenly inspired, \"unless it was that man\nRaffles.\"\n\n\"It couldn't 've bin,\" jerked the clerk from his conning-tower of a\ncollar.  \"He'd gone to Davy Jones long before.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\" asked Raffles.  \"Was his body ever found?\"\n\n\"Found and buried,\" replied our imaginative friend.  \"Malter, I think\nit was; or it may have been Giberaltar.  I forget which.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" I put in, rather annoyed at all this wilful work, yet not\nindisposed to make a late contribution--\"besides, Raffles would never\nhave smoked those cigarettes.  There was only one brand for him.  It\nwas--let me see--\"\n\n\"Sullivans?\" cried the clerk, right for once.  \"It's all a matter of\n'abit,\" he went on, as he replaced the twenty-five tin box with the\nvulgar wrapper.  \"I tried them once, and I didn't like 'em myself.\nIt's all a question of taste.  Now, if you want a good smoke, and\ncheaper, give me a Golden Gem at quarter of the price.\"\n\n\"What we really do want,\" remarked Raffles mildly, \"is to see something\nelse as clever as that last.\"\n\n\"Then come this way,\" said the clerk, and led us into a recess almost\nmonopolized by the iron-clamped chest of thrilling memory, now a mere\nplatform for the collection of mysterious objects under a dust-sheet on\nthe lid.  \"These,\" he continued, unveiling them with an air, \"are the\nRaffles Relics, taken from his rooms in the Albany after his death and\nburial, and the most complete set we've got.  That's his centre-bit,\nand this is the bottle of rock-oil he's supposed to have kept dipping\nit in to prevent making a noise.  Here's the revawlver he used when he\nshot at a gentleman on the roof down Horsham way; it was afterward\ntaken from him on the P. & O. boat before he jumped overboard.\"\n\nI could not help saying I understood that Raffles had never shot at\nanybody.  I was standing with my back to the nearest window, my hat\njammed over my brows and my overcoat collar up to my ears.\n\n\"That's the only time we know about,\" the clerk admitted; \"and it\ncouldn't be brought 'ome, or his precious pal would have got more than\nhe did.  This empty cawtridge is the one he 'id the Emperor's pearl in,\non the Peninsular and Orient.  These gimlets and wedges were what he\nused for fixin' doors.  This is his rope-ladder, with the telescope\nwalking-stick he used to hook it up with; he's said to have 'ad it with\nhim the night he dined with the Earl of Thornaby, and robbed the house\nbefore dinner.  That's his life-preserver; but no one can make out what\nthis little thick velvet bag's for, with the two holes and the elawstic\nround each.  Perhaps you can give a guess, sir?\"\n\nRaffles had taken up the bag that he had invented for the noiseless\nfiling of keys.  Now he handled it as though it were a tobacco-pouch,\nputting in finger and thumb, and shrugging over the puzzle with a\ndelicious face; nevertheless, he showed me a few grains of steel filing\nas the result of his investigations, and murmured in my ear, \"These\nsweet police!  I, for my part, could not but examine the life-preserver\nwith which I had once smitten Raffles himself to the ground: actually,\nthere was his blood upon it still; and seeing my horror, the clerk\nplunged into a characteristically garbled version of that incident\nalso.  It happened to have come to light among others at the Old\nBailey, and perhaps had its share in promoting the quality of mercy\nwhich had undoubtedly been exercised on my behalf.  But the present\nrecital was unduly trying, and Raffles created a noble diversion by\ncalling attention to an early photograph of himself, which may still\nhang on the wall over the historic chest, but which I had carefully\nignored.  It shows him in flannels, after some great feat upon the\ntented field.  I am afraid there is a Sullivan between his lips, a look\nof lazy insolence in the half-shut eyes.  I have since possessed myself\nof a copy, and it is not Raffles at his best; but the features are\nclean-cut and regular; and I often wish that I had lent it to the\nartistic gentlemen who have battered the statue out of all likeness to\nthe man.\n\n\"You wouldn't think it of him, would you?\" quoth the clerk.  \"It makes\nyou understand how no one ever did think it of him at the time.\"\n\nThe youth was looking full at Raffles, with the watery eyes of\nunsuspecting innocence.  I itched to emulate the fine bravado of my\nfriend.\n\n\"You said he had a pal,\" I observed, sinking deeper into the collar of\nmy coat.  \"Haven't you got a photograph of him?\"\n\nThe pale clerk gave such a sickly smile, I could have smacked some\nblood into his pasty face.\n\n\"You mean Bunny?\" said the familiar fellow.  \"No, sir, he'd be out of\nplace; we've only room for real criminals here.  Bunny was neither one\nthing nor the other.  He could follow Raffles, but that's all he could\ndo.  He was no good on his own.  Even when he put up the low-down job\nof robbing his old 'ome, it's believed he hadn't the 'eart to take the\nstuff away, and Raffles had to break in a second time for it.  No, sir,\nwe don't bother our heads about Bunny; we shall never hear no more of\n'im.  He was a harmless sort of rotter, if you awsk me.\"\n\nI had not asked him, and I was almost foaming under the respirator that\nI was making of my overcoat collar.  I only hoped that Raffles would\nsay something, and he did.\n\n\"The only case I remember anything about,\" he remarked, tapping the\nclamped chest with his umbrella, \"was this; and that time, at all\nevents, the man outside must have had quite as much to do as the one\ninside.  May I ask what you keep in it?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir.\n\n\"I imagined more relics inside.  Hadn't he some dodge of getting in and\nout without opening the lid?\"\n\n\"Of putting his head out, you mean,\" returned the clerk, whose\nknowledge of Raffles and his Relics was really most comprehensive on\nthe whole.  He moved some of the minor memorials and with his penknife\nraised the trap-door in the lid.\n\n\"Only a skylight,\" remarked Raffles, deliciously unimpressed.\n\n\"Why, what else did you expect?\" asked the clerk, letting the trap-door\ndown again, and looking sorry that he had taken so much trouble.\n\n\"A backdoor, at least!\" replied Raffles, with such a sly look at me\nthat I had to turn aside to smile.  It was the last time I smiled that\nday.\n\nThe door had opened as I turned, and an unmistakable detective had\nentered with two more sight-seers like ourselves.  He wore the hard,\nround hat and the dark, thick overcoat which one knows at a glance as\nthe uniform of his grade; and for one awful moment his steely eye was\nupon us in a flash of cold inquiry.  Then the clerk emerged from the\nrecess devoted to the Raffles Relics, and the alarming interloper\nconducted his party to the window opposite the door.\n\n\"Inspector Druce,\" the clerk informed us in impressive whispers, \"who\nhad the Chalk Farm case in hand.  He'd be the man for Raffles, if\nRaffles was alive to-day!\"\n\n\"I'm sure he would,\" was the grave reply.  \"I should be very sorry to\nhave a man like that after me.  But what a run there seems to be upon\nyour Black Museum!\"\n\n\"There isn't reelly, sir,\" whispered the clerk.  \"We sometimes go weeks\non end without having regular visitors like you two gentlemen. I think\nthose are friends of the Inspector's, come to see the Chalk Farm\nphotographs, that helped to hang his man.  We've a lot of interesting\nphotographs, sir, if you like to have a look at them.\"\n\n\"If it won't take long,\" said Raffles, taking out his watch; and as the\nclerk left our side for an instant he gripped my arm.  \"This is a bit\ntoo hot,\" he whispered, \"but we mustn't cut and run like rabbits.  That\nmight be fatal.  Hide your face in the photographs, and leave\neverything to me.  I'll have a train to catch as soon as ever I dare.\"\n\nI obeyed without a word, and with the less uneasiness as I had time to\nconsider the situation.  It even struck me that Raffles was for once\ninclined to exaggerate the undeniable risk that we ran by remaining in\nthe same room with an officer whom both he and I knew only too well by\nname and repute.  Raffles, after all, had aged and altered out of\nknowledge; but he had not lost the nerve that was equal to a far more\ndirect encounter than was at all likely to be forced upon us.  On the\nother hand, it was most improbable that a distinguished detective would\nknow by sight an obscure delinquent like myself; besides, this one had\ncome to the front since my day. Yet a risk it was, and I certainly did\nnot smile as I bent over the album of horrors produced by our guide.  I\ncould still take an interest in the dreadful photographs of murderous\nand murdered men; they appealed to the morbid element in my nature; and\nit was doubtless with degenerate unction that I called Raffles's\nattention to a certain scene of notorious slaughter.  There was no\nresponse. I looked round.  There was no Raffles to respond.  We had all\nthree been examining the photographs at one of the windows; at another\nthree newcomers were similarly engrossed; and without one word, or a\nsingle sound, Raffles had decamped behind all our backs.\n\nFortunately the clerk was himself very busy gloating over the horrors\nof the album; before he looked round I had hidden my astonishment, but\nnot my wrath, of which I had the instinctive sense to make no secret.\n\n\"My friend's the most impatient man on earth!\" I exclaimed.  \"He said\nhe was going to catch a train, and now he's gone without a word!\"\n\n\"I never heard him,\" said the clerk, looking puzzled.\n\n\"No more did I; but he did touch me on the shoulder,\" I lied, \"and say\nsomething or other.  I was too deep in this beastly book to pay much\nattention.  He must have meant that he was off.  Well, let him be off!\nI mean to see all that's to be seen.\"\n\nAnd in my nervous anxiety to allay any suspicions aroused by my\ncompanion's extraordinary behavior, I outstayed even the eminent\ndetective and his friends, saw them examine the Raffles Relics, heard\nthem discuss me under my own nose, and at last was alone with the\nanemic clerk.  I put my hand in my pocket, and measured him with a\nsidelong eye.  The tipping system is nothing less than a minor bane of\nmy existence.  Not that one is a grudging giver, but simply because in\nso many cases it is so hard to know whom to tip and what to tip him.  I\nknow what it is to be the parting guest who has not parted freely\nenough, and that not from stinginess but the want of a fine instinct on\nthe point.  I made no mistake, however, in the case of the clerk, who\naccepted my pieces of silver without demur, and expressed a hope of\nseeing the article which I had assured him I was about to write.  He\nhas had some years to wait for it, but I flatter myself that these\nbelated pages will occasion more interest than offense if they ever do\nmeet those watery eyes.\n\nTwilight was falling when I reached the street; the sky behind St.\nStephen's had flushed and blackened like an angry face; the lamps were\nlit, and under every one I was unreasonable enough to look for Raffles.\nThen I made foolishly sure that I should find him hanging about the\nstation, and hung thereabouts myself until one Richmond train had gone\nwithout me.  In the end I walked over the bridge to Waterloo, and took\nthe first train to Teddington instead.  That made a shorter walk of it,\nbut I had to grope my way through a white fog from the river to Ham\nCommon, and it was the hour of our cosy dinner when I reached our place\nof retirement. There was only a flicker of firelight on the blinds: I\nwas the first to return after all.  It was nearly four hours since\nRaffles had stolen away from my side in the ominous precincts of\nScotland Yard.  Where could he be?  Our landlady wrung her hands over\nhim; she had cooked a dinner after her favorite's heart, and I let it\nspoil before making one of the most melancholy meals of my life.\n\nUp to midnight there was no sign of him; but long before this time I\nhad reassured our landlady with a voice and face that must have given\nmy words the lie.  I told her that Mr. Ralph (as she used to call him)\nhad said something about going to the theatre; that I thought he had\ngiven up the idea, but I must have been mistaken, and should certainly\nsit up for him.  The attentive soul brought in a plate of sandwiches\nbefore she retired; and I prepared to make a night of it in a chair by\nthe sitting-room fire.  Darkness and bed I could not face in my\nanxiety.  In a way I felt as though duty and loyalty called me out into\nthe winter's night; and yet whither should I turn to look for Raffles?\nI could think of but one place, and to seek him there would be to\ndestroy myself without aiding him.  It was my growing conviction that\nhe had been recognized when leaving Scotland Yard, and either taken\nthen and there, or else hunted into some new place of hiding.  It would\nall be in the morning papers; and it was all his own fault.  He had\nthrust his head into the lion's mouth, and the lion's jaws had snapped.\nHad he managed to withdraw his head in time?\n\nThere was a bottle at my elbow, and that night I say deliberately that\nit was not my enemy but my friend.  It procured me at last some\nsurcease from my suspense.  I fell fast asleep in my chair before the\nfire.  The lamp was still burning, and the fire red, when I awoke; but\nI sat very stiff in the iron clutch of a wintry morning.  Suddenly I\nslued round in my chair.  And there was Raffles in a chair behind me,\nwith the door open behind him, quietly taking off his boots.\n\n\"Sorry to wake you, Bunny,\" said he.  \"I thought I was behaving like a\nmouse; but after a three hours' tramp one's feet are all heels.\"\n\nI did not get up and fall upon his neck.  I sat back in my chair and\nblinked with bitterness upon his selfish insensibility.  He should not\nknow what I had been through on his account.\n\n\"Walk out from town?\" I inquired, as indifferently as though he were in\nthe habit of doing so.\n\n\"From Scotland Yard,\" he answered, stretching himself before the fire\nin his stocking soles.\n\n\"Scotland Yard?\" I echoed.  \"Then I was right; that's where you were\nall the time; and yet you managed to escape!\"\n\nI had risen excitedly in my turn.\n\n\"Of course I did,\" replied Raffles.  \"I never thought there would be\nmuch difficulty about that, but there was even less than I anticipated.\nI did once find myself on one side of a sort of counter, and an officer\ndozing at his desk at the other side.  I thought it safest to wake him\nup and make inquiries about a mythical purse left in a phantom hansom\noutside the Carlton.  And the way the fellow fired me out of that was\nanother credit to the Metropolitan Police: it's only in the savage\ncountries that they would have troubled to ask how one had got in.\"\n\n\"And how did you?\" I asked.  \"And in the Lord's name, Raffles, when and\nwhy?\"\n\nRaffles looked down on me under raised eyebrows, as he stood with his\ncoat tails to the dying fire.\n\n\"How and when, Bunny, you know as well as I do,\" said he, cryptically.\n\"And at last you shall hear the honest why and wherefore.  I had more\nreasons for going to Scotland Yard, my dear fellow, than I had the face\nto tell you at the time.\"\n\n\"I don't care why you went there!\" I cried.  \"I want to know why you\nstayed, or went back, or whatever it was you may have done.  I thought\nthey had got you, and you had given them the slip!\"\n\nRaffles smiled as he shook his head.\n\n\"No, no, Bunny; I prolonged the visit, as I paid it, of my own accord.\nAs for my reasons, they are far too many for me to tell you them all;\nthey rather weighed upon me as I walked out; but you'll see them for\nyourself if you turn round.\"\n\nI was standing with my back to the chair in which I had been asleep;\nbehind the chair was the round lodging-house table; and there, reposing\non the cloth with the whiskey and sandwiches, was the whole collection\nof Raffles Relics which had occupied the lid of the silver-chest in the\nBlack Museum at Scotland Yard!  The chest alone was missing.  There was\nthe revolver that I had only once heard fired, and there the\nblood-stained life-preserver, brace-and-bit, bottle of rock-oil, velvet\nbag, rope-ladder, walking-stick, gimlets, wedges, and even the empty\ncartridge-case which had once concealed the gift of a civilized monarch\nto a potentate of color.\n\n\"I was a real Father Christmas,\" said Raffles, \"when I arrived. It's a\npity you weren't awake to appreciate the scene.  It was more edifying\nthan the one I found.  You never caught me asleep in my chair, Bunny!\"\n\nHe thought I had merely fallen asleep in my chair!  He could not see\nthat I had been sitting up for him all night long!  The hint of a\ntemperance homily, on top of all I had borne, and from Raffles of all\nmortal men, tried my temper to its last limit--but a flash of late\nenlightenment enabled me just to keep it.\n\n\"Where did you hide?\" I asked grimly.\n\n\"At the Yard itself.\"\n\n\"So I gather; but whereabouts at the Yard?\"\n\n\"Can you ask, Bunny?\"\n\n\"I am asking.\"\n\n\"It's where I once hid before.\"\n\n\"You don't mean in the chest?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\nOur eyes met for a minute.\n\n\"You may have ended up there,\" I conceded.  \"But where did you go first\nwhen you slipped out behind my back, and how the devil did you know\nwhere to go?\"\n\n\"I never did slip out,\" said Raffles, \"behind your back.  I slipped in.\"\n\n\"Into the chest?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nI burst out laughing in his face.\n\n\"My dear fellow, I saw all these things on the lid just afterward. Not\none of them was moved.  I watched that detective show them to his\nfriends.\"\n\n\"And I heard him.\"\n\n\"But not from the inside of the chest?\"\n\n\"From the inside of the chest, Bunny.  Don't look like that--it's\nfoolish.  Try to recall a few words that went before, between the idiot\nin the collar and me.  Don't you remember my asking him if there was\nanything in the chest?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"One had to be sure it was empty, you see.  Then I asked if there was a\nbackdoor to the chest as well as a skylight.\"\n\n\"I remember.\"\n\n\"I suppose you thought all that meant nothing?\"\n\n\"I didn't look for a meaning.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't; it would never occur to you that I might want to find\nout whether anybody at the Yard had found out that there was something\nprecisely in the nature of a sidedoor--it isn't a backdoor--to that\nchest.  Well, there is one; there was one soon after I took the chest\nback from your rooms to mine, in the good old days.  You push one of\nthe handles down--which no one ever does--and the whole of that end\nopens like the front of a doll's house.  I saw that was what I ought to\nhave done at first: it's so much simpler than the trap at the top; and\none likes to get a thing perfect for its own sake.  Besides, the trick\nhad not been spotted at the bank, and I thought I might bring it off\nagain some day; meanwhile, in one's bedroom, with lots of things on\ntop, what a port in a sudden squall!\"\n\nI asked why I had never heard of the improvement before, not so much at\nthe time it was made, but in these later days, when there were fewer\nsecrets between us, and this one could avail him no more. But I did not\nput the question out of pique.  I put it out of sheer obstinate\nincredulity.  And Raffles looked at me without replying, until I read\nthe explanation in his look.\n\n\"I see,\" I said.  \"You used to get into it to hide from me!\"\n\n\"My dear Bunny, I am not always a very genial man,\" he answered; \"but\nwhen you let me have a key of your rooms I could not very well refuse\nyou one of mine, although I picked your pocket of it in the end.  I\nwill only say that when I had no wish to see you, Bunny, I must have\nbeen quite unfit for human society, and it was the act of a friend to\ndeny you mine.  I don't think it happened more than once or twice.  You\ncan afford to forgive a fellow after all these years?\n\n\"That, yes,\" I replied bitterly; \"but not this, Raffles.\"\n\n\"Why not?  I really hadn't made up my mind to do what I did.  I had\nmerely thought of it.  It was that smart officer in the same room that\nmade me do it without thinking twice.\"\n\n\"And we never even heard you!\" I murmured, in a voice of involuntary\nadmiration which vexed me with myself.  \"But we might just as well!\" I\nwas as quick to add in my former tone.\n\n\"Why, Bunny?\"\n\n\"We shall be traced in no time through our ticket of admission.\"\n\n\"Did they collect it?\"\n\n\"No; but you heard how very few are issued.\"\n\n\"Exactly.  They sometimes go weeks on end without a regular visitor. It\nwas I who extracted that piece of information, Bunny, and I did nothing\nrash until I had.  Don't you see that with any luck it will be two or\nthree weeks before they are likely to discover their loss?\"\n\nI was beginning to see.\n\n\"And then, pray, how are they going to bring it home to us?  Why should\nthey even suspect us, Bunny?  I left early; that's all I did. You took\nmy departure admirably; you couldn't have said more or less if I had\ncoached you myself.  I relied on you, Bunny, and you never more\ncompletely justified my confidence.  The sad thing is that you have\nceased to rely on me.  Do you really think that I would leave the place\nin such a state that the first person who came in with a duster would\nsee that there had been a robbery?\"\n\nI denied the thought with all energy, though it perished only as I\nspoke.\n\n\"Have you forgotten the duster that was over these things, Bunny? Have\nyou forgotten all the other revolvers and life preservers that there\nwere to choose from?  I chose most carefully, and I replaced my relics\nwith a mixed assortment of other people's which really look just as\nwell.  The rope-ladder that now supplants mine is, of course, no patch\nupon it, but coiled up on the chest it really looks much the same.  To\nbe sure, there was no second velvet bag; but I replaced my stick with\nanother quite like it, and I even found an empty cartridge to\nunderstudy the setting of the Polynesian pearl. You see the sort of\nfellow they have to show people round: do you think he's the kind to\nsee the difference next time, or to connect it with us if he does?  One\nleft much the same things, lying much as he left them, under a\ndust-sheet which is only taken off for the benefit of the curious, who\noften don't turn up for weeks on end.\"\n\nI admitted that we might be safe for three or four weeks.  Raffles held\nout his hand.\n\n\"Then let us be friends about it, Bunny, and smoke the cigarette of\nSullivan and peace!  A lot may happen in three or four weeks; and what\nshould you say if this turned out to be the last as well as the least\nof all my crimes?  I must own that it seems to me their natural and\nfitting end, though I might have stopped more characteristically than\nwith a mere crime of sentiment.  No, I make no promises, Bunny; now I\nhave got these things, I may be unable to resist using them once more.\nBut with this war one gets all the excitement one requires--and rather\nmore than usual may happen in three or four weeks?\"\n\nWas he thinking even then of volunteering for the front?  Had he\nalready set his heart on the one chance of some atonement for his\nlife--nay, on the very death he was to die?  I never knew, and shall\nnever know.  Yet his words were strangely prophetic, even to the three\nor four weeks in which those events happened that imperilled the fabric\nof our empire, and rallied her sons from the four winds to fight\nbeneath her banner on the veldt.  It all seems very ancient history\nnow.  But I remember nothing better or more vividly than the last words\nof Raffles upon his last crime, unless it be the pressure of his hand\nas he said them, or the rather sad twinkle in his tired eyes.\n\n\n\n\nThe Last Word\n\nThe last of all these tales of Raffles is from a fresher and a sweeter\npen.  I give it exactly as it came to me, in a letter which meant more\nto me than it can possibly mean to any other reader. And yet, it may\nstand for something with those for whom these pale reflections have a\ntithe of the charm that the real man had for me; and it is to leave\nsuch persons thinking yet a little better of him (and not wasting\nanother thought on me) that I am permitted to retail the very last word\nabout their hero and mine.\n\nThe letter was my first healing after a chance encounter and a\nsleepless night; and I print every word of it except the last.\n\n                                     \"39 CAMPDEN GROVE COURT, W.,\n                                     \"June 28, 1900.\n\n\"DEAR HARRY: You may have wondered at the very few words I could find\nto say to you when we met so strangely yesterday.  I did not mean to be\nunkind.  I was grieved to see you so cruelly hurt and lame.  I could\nnot grieve when at last I made you tell me how it happened.  I honor\nand envy every man of you--every name in those dreadful lists that fill\nthe papers every day.  But I knew about Mr. Raffles, and I did not know\nabout you, and there was something I longed to tell you about him,\nsomething I could not tell you in a minute in the street, or indeed by\nword of mouth at all.  That is why I asked you for your address.\n\n\"You said I spoke as if I had known Mr. Raffles.  Of course I have\noften seen him playing cricket, and heard about him and you. But I only\nonce met him, and that was the night after you and I met last.  I have\nalways supposed that you knew all about our meeting.  Yesterday I could\nsee that you knew nothing.  So I have made up my mind to tell you every\nword.\n\n\"That night--I mean the next night--they were all going out to several\nplaces, but I stayed behind at Palace Gardens.  I had gone up to the\ndrawing-room after dinner, and was just putting on the lights, when in\nwalked Mr. Raffles from the balcony.  I knew him at once, because I\nhappened to have watched him make his hundred at Lord's only the day\nbefore.  He seemed surprised that no one had told me he was there, but\nthe whole thing was such a surprise that I hardly thought of that.  I\nam afraid I must say that it was not a very pleasant surprise.  I felt\ninstinctively that he had come from you, and I confess that for the\nmoment it made me very angry indeed.  Then in a breath he assured me\nthat you knew nothing of his coming, that you would never have allowed\nhim to come, but that he had taken it upon himself as your intimate\nfriend and one who would be mine as well.  (I said that I would tell\nyou every word.)\n\n\"Well, we stood looking at each other for some time, and I was never\nmore convinced of anybody's straightness and sincerity; but he was\nstraight and sincere with me, and true to you that night, whatever he\nmay have been before and after.  So I asked him why he had come, and\nwhat had happened; and he said it was not what had happened, but what\nmight happen next; so I asked him if he was thinking of you, and he\njust nodded, and told me that I knew very well what you had done.  But\nI began to wonder whether Mr. Raffles himself knew, and I tried to get\nhim to tell me what you had done, and he said I knew as well as he did\nthat you were one of the two men who had come to the house the night\nbefore.  I took some time to answer.  I was quite mystified by his\nmanner.  At last I asked him how he knew.  I can hear his answer now.\n\n\"'Because I was the other man,' he said quite quietly; 'because I led\nhim blindfold into the whole business, and would rather pay the shot\nthan see poor Bunny suffer for it.'\n\n\"Those were his words, but as he said them he made their meaning clear\nby going over to the bell, and waiting with his finger ready to ring\nfor whatever assistance or protection I desired.  Of course I would not\nlet him ring at all; in fact, at first I refused to believe him.  Then\nhe led me out into the balcony, and showed me exactly how he had got up\nand in.  He had broken in for the second night running, and all to tell\nme that the first night he had brought you with him on false pretences.\nHe had to tell me a great deal more before I could quite believe him.\nBut before he went (as he had come) I was the one woman in the world\nwho knew that A. J. Raffles, the great cricketer, and the so-called\n'amateur cracksman' of equal notoriety, were one and the same person.\n\n\"He had told me his secret, thrown himself on my mercy, and put his\nliberty if not his life in my hands, but all for your sake, Harry, to\nright you in my eyes at his own expense.  And yesterday I could see\nthat you knew nothing whatever about it, that your friend had died\nwithout telling you of his act of real and yet vain self-sacrifice!\nHarry, I can only say that now I understand your friendship, and the\ndreadful lengths to which it carried you.  How many in your place would\nnot have gone as far for such a friend? Since that night, at any rate,\nI for one have understood.  It has grieved me more than I can tell you,\nHarry, but I have always understood.\n\n\"He spoke to me quite simply and frankly of his life.  It was wonderful\nto me then that he should speak of it as he did, and still more\nwonderful that I should sit and listen to him as I did. But I have\noften thought about it since, and have long ceased to wonder at myself.\nThere was an absolute magnetism about Mr. Raffles which neither you nor\nI could resist.  He had the strength of personality which is a\ndifferent thing from strength of character; but when you meet both\nkinds together, they carry the ordinary mortal off his or her feet.\nYou must not imagine you are the only one who would have served and\nfollowed him as you did. When he told me it was all a game to him, and\nthe one game he knew that was always exciting, always full of danger\nand of drama, I could just then have found it in my heart to try the\ngame myself! Not that he treated me to any ingenious sophistries or\nparadoxical perversities.  It was just his natural charm and humor, and\na touch of sadness with it all, that appealed to something deeper than\none's reason and one's sense of right.  Glamour, I suppose, is the\nword.  Yet there was far more in him than that.  There were depths,\nwhich called to depths; and you will not misunderstand me when I say I\nthink it touched him that a woman should listen to him as I did, and in\nsuch circumstances.  I know that it touched me to think of such a life\nso spent, and that I came to myself and implored him to give it all up.\nI don't think I went on my knees over it.  But I am afraid I did cry;\nand that was the end.  He pretended not to notice anything, and then in\nan instant he froze everything with a flippancy which jarred horribly\nat the time, but has ever since touched me more than all the rest.  I\nremember that I wanted to shake hands at the end.  But Mr. Raffles only\nshook his head, and for one instant his face was as sad as it was\ngallant and gay all the rest of the time.  Then he went as he had come,\nin his own dreadful way, and not a soul in the house knew that he had\nbeen.  And even you were never told!\n\n\"I didn't mean to write all this about your own friend, whom you knew\nso much better yourself, yet you see that even you did not know how\nnobly he tried to undo the wrong he had done you; and now I think I\nknow why he kept it to himself.  It is fearfully late--or early--I seem\nto have been writing all night--and I will explain the matter in the\nfewest words.  I promised Mr. Raffles that I would write to you, Harry,\nand see you if I could.  Well, I did write, and I did mean to see you,\nbut I never had an answer to what I wrote.  It was only one line, and I\nhave long known you never received it.  I could not bring myself to\nwrite more, and even those few words were merely slipped into one of\nthe books which you had given me.  Years afterward these books, with my\nname in them, must have been found in your rooms; at any rate they were\nreturned to me by somebody; and you could never have opened them, for\nthere was my line where I had left it.  Of course you had never seen\nit, and that was all my fault.  But it was too late to write again.\nMr. Raffles was supposed to have been drowned, and everything was known\nabout you both.  But I still kept my own independent knowledge to\nmyself; to this day, no one else knows that you were one of the two in\nPalace Gardens; and I still blame myself more than you may think for\nnearly everything that has happened since.\n\n\"You said yesterday that your going to the war and getting wounded\nwiped out nothing that had gone before.  I hope you are not growing\nmorbid about the past.  It is not for me to condone it, and  yet I know\nthat Mr. Raffles was what he was because he loved danger and adventure,\nand that you were what you were because you loved Mr. Raffles.  But,\neven admitting it was all as bad as bad could be, he is dead, and you\nare punished.  The world forgives, if it does not forget.  You are\nyoung enough to live everything down.  Your part in the war will help\nyou in more ways than one.  You were always fond of writing.  You have\nnow enough to write about for a literary lifetime.  You must make a new\nname for yourself.  You must Harry, and you will!\n\n\"I suppose you know that my aunt, Lady Melrose, died some years ago?\nShe was the best friend I had in the world, and it is thanks to her\nthat I am living my own life now in the one way after my own heart.\nThis is a new block of flats, one of those where they do everything for\nyou; and though mine is tiny, it is more than all I shall ever want.\nOne does just exactly what one likes--and you must blame that habit for\nall that is least conventional in what I have said. Yet I should like\nyou to understand why it is that I have said so much, and, indeed, left\nnothing unsaid.  It is because I want never to have to say or hear\nanother word about anything that is past and over.  You may answer that\nI run no risk!  Nevertheless, if you did care to come and see me some\nday as an old friend, we might find one or two new points of contact,\nfor I am rather trying to write myself!  You might almost guess as much\nfrom this letter; it is long enough for anything; but, Harry, if it\nmakes you realize that one of your oldest friends is glad to have seen\nyou, and will be gladder still to see you again, and to talk of\nanything and everything except the past, I shall cease to be ashamed\neven of its length!\n\n\"And so good-by for the present from\n                                                        \"____\"\n\n\n\nI omit her name and nothing else.  Did I not say in the beginning that\nit should never be sullied by association with mine?  And yet--and\nyet--even as I write I have a hope in my heart of hearts which is not\nquite consistent with that sentiment.  It is as faint a hope as man\never had, and yet its audacity makes the pen tremble in my fingers.\nBut, if it be ever realized, I shall owe more than I could deserve in a\ncentury of atonement to one who atoned more nobly than I ever can.  And\nto think that to the end I never heard one word of it from Raffles!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Thief in the Night, by E. W.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":77,"split":"train"}
