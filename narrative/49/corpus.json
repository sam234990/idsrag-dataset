{"ori_id":"0bc9bac5aa5a407fd2cca4cdefcde62ae41a98ca","title":"Policeman Bluejay","context":"Policeman Bluejay\n At the story's start, Twinkle and Chubbins are lost in a \"great forest.\" They encounter a \"tuxix\" \u2014 a creature that looks like a spiny turtle, but is in reality \"a magician, a sorcerer, a wizard, and a witch all rolled into one...and you can imagine what a dreadful thing that would be.\" The evil tuxix casts a spell on the children, transforming them into little bird-like beings, with their own heads but the bodies of skylarks. (They resemble the human-headed, bird-bodied sirins, alkonosts, and gamayuns of Russian folklore.) Policeman Bluejay, the force of order in the avian world of the forest, leads the two child-larks on a flight through the sky; he esconces them in an abandoned thrush's nest in a maple tree, and with the help of a friendly eagle he retrieves their picnic basket (so that they don't have to eat bugs, worms, and grubs).\nTwinkle and Chubbins learn of their new maple-tree neighbors, a squirrel, an owl, and an o'possum; and Policeman Bluejay introduces them to the community of birds. The children see that the world of living beings in the forest has structure, relationships, and conflict. They hear stories of human cruelty to animals \u2013 and soon they witness it firsthand, when hunters enter the forest. The hunters kill Mrs. 'Possum and Mrs. Hootaway and Wisk the squirrel; Twinkle tries to protest, but she can only make a skylark's chirp. The hunters' dog almost catches Twinkle \u2013 but she and Chubbins are rescued by their friend the eagle, who swoops down, kills the dog, and leads them to safety.\nOr relative safety, at least: the eagle takes the two lark-children up to his eyrie, where his hungry hatchlings want to eat them for breakfast. (Baum acknowledges that animals, to survive, have to prey upon each other. Yet he maintains that \"love\" is the Grand Law of the forest.) Policeman Bluejay escorts the children to a safer location. Soon he takes them to the Paradise of Birds, where the contentions and violence of the forest never penetrate. The children are given a tour of its splendors, and meet the King Bird of Paradise. In the \"suburbs\" of Paradise, the child-larks are introduced to the community of bees, and meet the Queen Bee; and they witness a spectacular flight of butterflies.\nBeyond Paradise, in \"the coarse, outer world,\" there is trouble in birdland; Policeman Bluejay must cope with a rebellion among the rooks, who would make the other birds their slaves. By uniting, the smaller birds beat the rooks in a battle. The King Bird of Paradise and his Royal Necromancer have told the children that they can restore themselves to human form by eating a fruit called \"tingle-berries.\" They do so, and return to their normal bodies \u2013 though Chubbins almost gets stuck halfway. Their adventure done, the children make their way home in the waning light of evening.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook of Policeman Bluejay, by L.

Therefore I have been encouraged to write a new \"TWINKLE\nBOOK,\" hoping with all my heart that my little friends will find it\nworthy to occupy a place beside the others on their pet bookshelves.\nAnd because the children seem to especially love the story of \"Bandit\nJim Crow,\" and bird-life is sure to appeal alike to their hearts and\ntheir imaginations, I have again written about birds.\n\nThe tale is fantastical, and intended to amuse rather than instruct;\nyet many of the traits of the feathered folk, herein described, are in\nstrict accordance with natural history teachings and will serve to\nacquaint my readers with the habits of birds in their wildwood homes.\nAt the same time my birds do unexpected things, because I have written\na fairy tale and not a natural history.\n\nThe question is often asked me whether Twinkle and Chubbins were asleep\nor awake when they encountered these wonderful adventures; and it\ngrieves me to reflect that the modern child has been deprived of fairy\ntales to such an extent that it does not know--as I did when a girl--\nthat in a fairy story it does not matter whether one is awake or not.\nYou must accept it as you would a fragrant breeze that cools your brow,\na draught of sweet water, or the delicious flavor of a strawberry, and\nbe grateful for the pleasure it brings you, without stopping to\nquestion too closely its source.\n\nFor my part I am glad if my stories serve to while away a pleasant hour\nbefore bedtime or keep one contented on a rainy day. In this way they\nare sure to be useful, and if a little tenderness for the helpless\nanimals and birds is acquired with the amusement, the value of the\ntales will be doubled.\n\nLAURA BANCROFT.\n\n\nLIST OF CHAPTERS\n\nI     LITTLE ONES IN TROUBLE\nII    POLICEMAN BLUEJAY\nIII   THE CHILD-LARKS\nIV    AN AFTERNOON RECEPTION\nV     THE ORIOLE'S STORY\nVI    A MERRY ADVENTURE\nVII   THE BLUEJAY'S STORY\nVIII  MRS.

LET'S GO HOME\"\n\n\n[CHAPTER I] _Little Ones in Trouble_\n\n\"SEEMS to me, Chub,\" said Twinkle, \"that we're lost.\"\n\n\"Seems to me, Twink,\" said Chubbins, \"that it isn't _we_ that's lost.\nIt's the path.\"\n\n\"It was here a minute ago,\" declared Twinkle.\n\n\"But it isn't here now,\" replied the boy.\n\n\"That's true,\" said the girl.\n\nIt really _was_ queer. They had followed the straight path into the\ngreat forest, and had only stopped for a moment to sit down and rest,\nwith the basket between them and their backs to a big tree. Twinkle\nwinked just twice, because she usually took a nap in the afternoon, and\nChubbins merely closed his eyes a second to find out if he could see\nthat long streak of sunshine through his pink eyelids. Yet during this\nsecond, which happened while Twinkle was winking, the path had run away\nand left them without any guide or any notion which way they ought to\ngo.\n\nAnother strange thing was that when they jumped up to look around them\nthe nearest trees began sliding away, in a circle, leaving the little\ngirl and boy in a clear space. And the trees continued moving back and\nback, farther and farther, until all their trunks were jammed tight\ntogether, and not even a mouse could have crept between them. They made\na solid ring around Twinkle and Chubbins, who stood looking at this\ntransformation with wondering eyes.\n\n\"It's a trap,\" said Chubbins; \"and we're in it.\"\n\n\"It looks that way,\" replied Twinkle, thoughtfully. \"Isn't it lucky,\nChub, we have the basket with us? If it wasn't for that, we might\nstarve to death in our prison.\"\n\n\"Oh, well,\" replied the little fellow, \"the basket won't last long.\nThere's plenty of starve in the bottom of it, Twinkle, any way you can\nfix it.\"\n\n\"That's so; unless we can get out. Whatever do you suppose made the\ntrees behave that way, Chubbins?\n\n\"Don't know,\" said the boy.\n\nJust then a queer creature dropped from a tree into the ring and began\nmoving slowly toward them. It was flat in shape, like a big turtle;\nonly it hadn't a turtle's hard shell. Instead, its body was covered\nwith sharp prickers, like rose thorns, and it had two small red eyes\nthat looked cruel and wicked. The children could not see how many legs\nit had, but they must have been very short, because the creature moved\nso slowly over the ground.\n\nWhen it had drawn near to them it said, in a pleading tone that sounded\nsoft and rather musical:\n\n\"Little girl, pick me up in your arms, and pet me!\"\n\nTwinkle shrank back.\n\n\"My! I couldn't _think_ of doing such a thing,\" she answered.\n\nThen the creature said:\n\n\"Little boy, please pick me up in your arms, and pet me!\"\n\n\"Go 'way!\" shouted Chubbins. \"I wouldn't touch you for anything.\"\n\nThe creature turned its red eyes first upon one and then upon the\nother.\n\n\"Listen, my dears,\" it continued; \"I was once a beautiful maiden, but a\ncruel tuxix transformed me into this awful shape, and so must I remain\nuntil some child willingly takes me in its arms and pets me. Then, and\nnot till then, will I be restored to my proper form.\"\n\n\"Don't believe it! Don't believe it!\" cried a high, clear voice, and\nboth the boy and the girl looked quickly around to see who had spoken.\nBut no one besides themselves was in sight, and they only noticed a\nthick branch of one of the trees slightly swaying its leaves.\n\n\"What is a tuxix?\" asked Twinkle, who was beginning to feel sorry for\nthe poor creature.\n\n\"It is a magician, a sorcerer, a wizard, and a witch all rolled into\none,\" was the answer; \"and you can imagine what a dreadful thing that\nwould be.\"\n\n\"Be careful!\" cried the clear voice, again. \"It is the tuxix herself\nwho is talking to you. Don't believe a word you hear!\"\n\nAt this the red eyes of the creature flashed fire with anger, and it\ntried to turn its clumsy body around to find the speaker. Twinkle and\nChubbins looked too, but only heard a flutter and a mocking laugh\ncoming from the trees.\n\n\"If I get my eye on that bird, it will never speak again,\" exclaimed\nthe creature, in a voice of fury very different from the sweet tones it\nhad at first used; and perhaps it was this fact that induced the\nchildren to believe the warning was from a friend, and they would do\nwell to heed it.\n\n\"Whether you are the tuxix or not,\" said Twinkle, \"I never will touch\nyou. You may be sure of that.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" declared Chubbins, stoutly, as he came closer to the girl and\ngrasped her hand in his own.\n\nAt this the horrid thing bristled all its sharp prickers in anger, and\nsaid:\n\n\"Then, if I cannot conquer you in one way, I will in another. Go, both\nof you, and join the bird that warned you, and live in the air and the\ntrees until you repent your stubbornness and promise to become my\nslaves. The tuxix has spoken, and her magical powers are at work. Go!\"\n\nIn an instant Twinkle saw Chubbins shoot through the air and disappear\namong the leaves of one of the tall trees. As he went he seemed to grow\nvery small, and to change in shape.\n\n\"Wait!\" she cried. \"I'm coming, too!\"\n\nShe was afraid of losing Chubbins, so she flew after him, feeling\nrather queer herself, and a moment after was safe in the tall tree,\nclinging with her toes to a branch and looking in amazement at the boy\nwho sat beside her.\n\nChubbins had been transformed into a pretty little bird--all, that is,\nexcept his head, which was Chubbins' own head reduced in size to fit\nthe bird body. It still had upon it the straw hat, which had also grown\nsmall in size, and the sight that met Twinkle's eyes was so funny that\nshe laughed merrily, and her laugh was like the sweet warbling of a\nskylark.\n\nChubbins looked at her and saw almost what she saw; for Twinkle was a\nbird too, except for her head, with its checked sunbonnet, which had\ngrown small enough to fit the pretty, glossy-feathered body of a lark.\n\nBoth of them had to cling fast to the branch with their toes, for their\narms and hands were now wings. The toes were long and sharp pointed, so\nthat they could be used in the place of fingers.\n\n\"My!\" exclaimed Twinkle; \"you're a queer sight, Chubbins!\"\n\n\"So are you,\" answered the boy. \"That mean old thing must have 'witched\nus.\"\n\n\"Yes, we're 'chanted,\" said Twinkle. \"And now, what are we going to do\nabout it? We can't go home, for our folks would be scared nearly into\nfits. And we don't know the way home, either.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" said Chubbins, fluttering his little wings to keep from\nfalling, for he had nearly lost his balance.\n\n\"What shall we do?\" she continued.\n\n\"Why, fly around and be gay and happy,\" said a clear and merry voice\nbeside them. \"That's what birds are expected to do!\"\n\n\n\n[CHAPTER II] _The Forest Guardian_\n\nTwinkle and Chubbins twisted their heads around on their little\nfeathered necks and saw perched beside them a big bird of a most\nbeautiful blue color. At first they were a bit frightened, for the\nnewcomer seemed of giant size beside their little lark bodies, and he\nwas, moreover, quite fierce in appearance, having a crest of feathers\nthat came to a point above his head, and a strong beak and sharp\ntalons. But Twinkle looked full into the shrewd, bright eye, and found\nit good humored and twinkling; so she plucked up courage and asked:\n\n\"Were you speaking to us?\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" replied the blue bird, in a cheerful tone. \"There's no\none else around to speak to.\"\n\n\"And was it you who warned us against that dreadful creature below in\nthe forest?\" she continued.\n\n\"It was.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Twinkle, \"we are very much obliged to you.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" said the other. \"I'm the forest policeman--\nPoliceman Bluejay, you know--and it's my duty to look after everyone\nwho is in trouble.\"\n\n\"We're in trouble, all right,\" said Chubbins, sorrowfully.\n\n\"Well, it might have been worse,\" remarked Policeman Bluejay, making a\nchuckling sound in his throat that Twinkle thought was meant for a\nlaugh. \"If you had ever touched the old tuxix she would have\ntransformed you into toads or lizards. That is an old trick of hers, to\nget children into her power and then change them into things as\nloathsome as herself.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't have touched her, anyhow,\" said Twinkle.\n\n\"Nor I!\" cried Chubbins, in his shrill, bird-like voice. \"She wasn't\nnice.\"\n\n\"Still, it was good of you to warn us,\" Twinkle added, sweetly.\n\nThe Bluejay looked upon the fluttering little things with kind\napproval. Then he laughed outright.\n\n\"What has happened to your heads?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nothing, 'cept they're smaller,\" replied Chubbins.\n\n\"But birds shouldn't have human heads,\" retorted the bluejay. \"I\nsuppose the old tuxix did that so the birds would not admit you into\ntheir society, for you are neither all bird nor all human. But never\nmind; I'll explain your case, and you may be sure all the birds of the\nforest will be kind to you.\"\n\n\"Must we stay like this always?\" asked Twinkle, anxiously.\n\n\"I really can't say,\" answered the policeman. \"There is said to be a\nway to break every enchantment, if one knows what it is. The trouble in\nthese cases is to discover what the charm may be that will restore you\nto your natural shapes. But just now you must make up your minds to\nlive in our forest for a time, and to be as happy as you can under the\ncircumstances.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll try,\" said Chubbins, with a sigh.\n\n\"That's right,\" exclaimed Policeman Bluejay, nodding his crest in\napproval. \"The first thing you must have is a house; so, if you will\nfly with me, I will try to find you one.\"\n\n\"I--I'm afraid!\" said Twinkle, nervously.\n\n\"The larks,\" declared the bluejay, \"are almost the strongest and best\nflyers we have. You two children have now become skylarks, and may soar\nso high in the air that you can scarcely see the earth below you. For\nthat reason you need have no fear whatever. Be bold and brave, and all\nwill be well.\"\n\nHe spoke in such a kindly and confident voice that both Twinkle and\nChubbins gained courage; and when the policeman added: \"Come on!\" and\nflew straight as an arrow into the air above the tree-tops, the two\nlittle skylarks with their girl and boy heads followed swiftly after\nhim, and had no trouble in going just as fast as their conductor.\n\nIt was quite a pleasant and interesting experience, to dart through the\nair and be in no danger of falling. When they rested on their\noutstretched wings they floated as lightly as bubbles, and soon a\njoyous thrill took possession of them and they began to understand why\nit is that the free, wild birds are always so happy in their native\nstate.\n\nThe forest was everywhere under them, for it was of vast extent.\nPresently the bluejay swooped downward and alighted near the top of a\ntall maple tree that had many thick branches.\n\nIn a second Twinkle and Chubbins were beside him, their little hearts\nbeating fast in their glossy bosoms from the excitement of their rapid\nflight. Just in front of them, firmly fastened to a crotch of a limb,\nwas a neatly built nest of a gray color, lined inside with some soft\nsubstance that was as smooth as satin.\n\n\"Here,\" said their thoughtful friend, \"is the nest that Niddie Thrush\nand Daisy Thrush built for themselves a year ago. They have now gone to\nlive in a wood across the big river, so you are welcome to their old\nhome. It is almost as good as new, and there is no rent to pay.\"\n\n\"It's awfully small!\" said Chubbins.\n\n\"Chut-chut!\" twittered Policeman Bluejay. \"Remember you are not\nchildren now, but skylarks, and that this is a thrush's nest. Try it,\nand you are sure to find it will fit you exactly.\"\n\nSo Twinkle and Chubbins flew into the \"house\" and nestled their bodies\nagainst its soft lining and found that their friend was right. When\nthey were cuddled together, with their slender legs tucked into the\nfeathers of their breasts, they just filled the nest to the brim, and\nno more room was necessary.\n\n\"Now, I'll mark the nest for you, so that everyone will know you claim\nit,\" said the policeman; and with his bill he pecked a row of small\ndots in the bark of the limb, just beside the nest. \"I hope you will be\nvery happy here, and this afternoon I will bring some friends to meet\nyou. So now good-bye until I see you again.\"\n\n\"Wait!\" cried Chubbins. \"What are we going to eat?\"\n\n\"Eat!\" answered the bluejay, as if surprised. \"Why, you may feast upon\nall the good things the forest offers--grubs, beetles, worms, and\nbutterfly-eggs.\"\n\n\"Ugh!\" gasped Chubbins. \"It makes me sick to just think of it.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"You see,\" said Twinkle, \"we are not _all_ birds, Mr. Bluejay, as you\nare; and that makes a big difference. We have no bills to pick up the\nthings that birds like to eat, and we do not care for the same sort of\nfood, either.\"\n\n\"What _do_ you care for?\" asked the policeman, in a puzzled voice.\n\n\"Why, cake and sandwitches, and pickles, and cheese, such as we had in\nour basket. We couldn't _eat_ any live things, you see, because we are\nnot used to it.\"\n\nThe bluejay became thoughtful.\n\n\"I understand your objection,\" he said, \"and perhaps you are right, not\nhaving good bird sense because the brains in your heads are still human\nbrains. Let me see: what can I do to help you?\"\n\nThe children did not speak, but watched him anxiously.\n\n\"Where did you leave your basket?\" he finally asked.\n\n\"In the place where the old witch 'chanted us.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the officer of the forest, \"I must try to get it for you.\"\n\n\"It is too big and heavy for a bird to carry,\" suggested Twinkle.\n\n\"Sure enough. Of course. That's a fact.\" He turned his crested head\nupward, trying to think of a way, and saw a black speck moving across\nthe sky.\n\n\"Wait a minute! I'll be back,\" he called, and darted upward like a\nflash.\n\nThe children watched him mount into the sky toward the black speck, and\nheard his voice crying out in sharp, quick notes. And before long\nPoliceman Bluejay attracted the other bird's attention, causing it to\npause in its flight and sink slowly downward until the two drew close\ntogether.\n\nThen it was seen that the other bird was a great eagle, strong and\nsharp-eyed, and with broad wings that spread at least six feet from tip\nto tip.\n\n\"Good day, friend eagle,\" said the bluejay; \"I hope you are in no\nhurry, for I want to ask you to do me a great favor.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked the eagle, in a big, deep voice.\n\n\"Please go to a part of the forest with me and carry a basket to some\nfriends of mine. I'll show you the way. It is too heavy for me to lift,\nbut with your great strength you can do it easily.\"\n\n\"It will give me pleasure to so favor you,\" replied the eagle,\npolitely; so Policeman Bluejay led the way and the eagle followed with\nsuch mighty strokes of its wings that the air was sent whirling in\nlittle eddies behind him, as the water is churned by a steamer's\npaddles.\n\nIt was not very long before they reached the clearing in the forest.\nThe horrid tuxix had wriggled her evil body away, to soothe her\ndisappointment by some other wicked act; but the basket stood as the\nchildren had left it.\n\nThe eagle seized the handle in his stout beak and found it was no\ntrouble at all for him to fly into the air and carry the basket with\nhim.\n\n\"This way, please--this way!\" chirped the bluejay; and the eagle bore\nthe precious burden safely to the maple tree, and hung it upon a limb\njust above the nest.\n\nAs he approached he made such a fierce fluttering that Twinkle and\nChubbins were dreadfully scared and flew out of their nest, hopping\nfrom limb to limb until they were well out of the monstrous bird's way.\nBut when they saw the basket, and realized the eagle's kindly act, they\nflew toward him and thanked him very earnestly for his assistance.\n\n\"Goodness me!\" exclaimed the eagle, turning his head first on one side\nand then on the other, that both his bright eyes might observe the\nchild-larks; \"what curious creatures have you here, my good policeman?\"\n\n\"Why, it is another trick of old Hautau, the tuxix. She found two\nchildren in the forest and enchanted them. She wanted to make them\ntoads, but they wouldn't touch her, so she couldn't. Then she got\nherself into a fine rage and made the little dears half birds and half\nchildren, as you see them. I was in a tree near by, and saw the whole\nthing. Because I was sorry for the innocent victims I befriended them,\nand as this basket belongs to them I have asked you to fetch it to\ntheir nest.\"\n\n\"I am glad to be of service,\" replied the eagle. \"If ever you need me,\nand I am anywhere around,\" he continued, addressing the larks, \"just\ncall me, and I will come at once.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Twinkle, gratefully.\n\n\"We're much obliged,\" added Chubbins.\n\nThen the eagle flew away, and when he was gone Policeman Bluejay also\nbade them good-bye.\n\n\"I'll be back this afternoon, without fail,\" he said. \"Just now I must\ngo and look over the forest, and make sure none of the birds have been\nin mischief during my absence. Do not go very far from your nest, for a\ntime, or you may get lost. The forest is a big place; but when you are\nmore used to it and to your new condition you can be more bold in\nventuring abroad.\"\n\n\"We won't leave this tree,\" promised Twinkle, in an earnest voice.\n\nAnd Chubbins chimed in with, \"That's right; we won't leave this tree\nuntil you come back.\"\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said the policeman.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" responded Twinkle and Chubbins.\n\nSo the bluejay darted away and was soon lost to sight, and Twinkle and\nChubbins were left alone to seriously consider the great misfortune\nthat had overtaken them.\n\n\n\n[CHAPTER III] _The Child-Larks_\n\n\"Folks will be worried about us, Twink,\" said Chubbins.\n\n\"'Course they will,\" Twinkle replied. \"They'll wonder what has become\nof us, and try to find us.\"\n\n\"But they won't look in the tree-tops.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Nor think to ask the birds where we are.\"\n\n\"Why should they?\" enquired Twinkle. \"They can't talk to the birds,\nChub.\"\n\n\"Why not? We talk to them, don't we? And they talk to us. At least, the\np'liceman and the eagle did.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" answered Twinkle, \"and I don't understand it a bit. I\nmust ask Mr. Bluejay to 'splain it to us.\"\n\n\"What's the use of a p'liceman in the forest?\" asked Chubbins, after a\nmoment's thought.\n\n\"I suppose,\" she replied, \"that he has to keep the birds from being\nnaughty. Some birds are just awful mischiefs, Chub. There's the\nmagpies, you know, that steal; and the crows that fight; and the\njackdaws that are saucy, and lots of others that get into trouble.\nSeems to me P'liceman Bluejay's a pretty busy bird, if he looks after\nthings as he ought.\"\n\n\"Prob'ly he's got his hands full,\" said Chubbins.\n\n\"Not that; for he hasn't any hands, any more than we have. Perhaps you\nought to say he's got his wings full,\" suggested Twinkle.\n\n\"That reminds me I'm hungry,\" chirped the boy-lark.\n\n\"Well, we've got the basket,\" she replied.\n\n\"But how can we eat cake and things, witched up as we are?\"\n\n\"Haven't we mouths and teeth, just the same as ever?\"\n\n\"Yes, but we haven't any hands, and there's a cloth tied over the top\nof the basket.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" exclaimed Twinkle; \"I hadn't thought of that.\"\n\nThey flew together to the basket and perched upon the edge of it. It\nseemed astonishingly big to them, now that they were so small; but\nChubbins remarked that this fact was a pleasant one, for instead of\neating all the good things the basket contained at one meal, as they\nhad at first intended, it would furnish them with food for many days to\ncome.\n\nBut how to get into the basket was the thing to be considered just now.\nThey fluttered around on every side of it, and finally found a small\nplace where the cloth was loose. In a minute Chubbins began clawing at\nit with his little feet, and Twinkle helped him; so that gradually they\nmanaged to pull the cloth away far enough for one of them to crawl\nthrough the opening. Then the other followed, and because the big\nbasket was not quite full there was exactly room for them to stand\nunderneath the cloth and walk around on top of a row of cookies that\nlay next to a row of sandwiches.\n\nThe cookies seemed enormous. One was lying flat, and Chubbins declared\nit seemed as big around as the dining-table at home.\n\n\"All the better for us,\" said Twinkle, bending her head down to nibble\nat the edge of the cookie.\n\n\"If we're going to be birds,\" said Chubbins, who was also busily eating\nas best he could, \"we ought to be reg'lar birds, and have bills to peck\nwith. This being half one thing and half another doesn't suit me at\nall.\"\n\n\"The witch wasn't trying to suit us,\" replied Twinkle; \"she was trying\nto get us into trouble.\"\n\n\"Well, she did it, all right,\" he said.\n\nIt was not so hard to eat as they had feared, for their slender necks\nenabled them to bend their heads low. Chubbins' hat fell off, a minute\nlater, and he wondered how he was going to get it on his head again.\n\n\"Can't you stand on one foot, and use the other foot like a hand?\"\nasked Twinkle.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said he.\n\n\"The storks stand on one leg,\" continued the girl. \"I've seen 'em in\npictures.\"\n\nSo Chubbins tried it, and found he could balance his little body on one\nleg very nicely. For if he toppled either way he had but to spread his\nwings and tail feathers and so keep himself from falling. He picked up\nhis hat with the claws of his other foot and managed to put it on by\nducking his head.\n\nThis gave the boy-lark a new idea. He broke off a piece of the cookie\nand held it in his claw while he ate it; and seeing his success Twinkle\nfollowed his example, and after a few attempts found she could eat very\ncomfortably in that way.\n\nHaving had their luncheon--and it amazed Chubbins to see how very\nlittle was required to satisfy their hunger--the bird-children crept\nout of the basket and flew down to the twig beside their nest.\n\n\"Hello!\" cried a strange voice. \"Newcomers, eh?\"\n\nThey were so startled that they fluttered a moment to keep from\ntumbling off the limb. Then Twinkle saw a furry red head sticking out\nof a small hollow in the trunk of the tree. The head had two round\nblack eyes, an inquisitive nose, a wide mouth with sharp teeth and\nwhiskers like those of a cat. It seemed as big as the moon to the shy\nlittle child-larks, until it occurred to the girl that the strange\ncreature must be a squirrel.\n\n\"You--you scared us!\" she said, timidly.\n\n\"You scared _me,_ at first,\" returned the squirrel, in a comic tone.\n\"Dear me! how came you birds to have children's heads?\"\n\n\"That isn't the way to put it,\" remarked Chubbins, staring back into\nthe eyes of the squirrel. \"You should ask how we children happened to\nhave birds' bodies.\"\n\n\"Very well; put the conundrum that way, if you like,\" said the\nsquirrel. \"What is the answer?\"\n\n\"We are enchanted,\" replied Twinkle.\n\n\"Ah. The tuxix?\"\n\n\"Yes. We were caught in the forest, and she bewitched us.\"\n\n\"That is too bad,\" said their new acquaintance. \"She is a very wicked\nold creature, for a fact, and loves to get folks into trouble. Are you\ngoing to live here?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the girl. \"Policeman Bluejay gave us this nest.\"\n\n\"Then it's all right; for Policeman Bluejay rules the feathered tribes\nof this forest about as he likes. Have you seen him in full uniform\nyet?\"\n\n\"No,\" they replied, \"unless his feathers are his uniform.\"\n\n\"Well, he's too proud of his office to be satisfied with feathers, I\ncan tell you. When some folks get a little authority they want all the\nworld to know about it, and a bold uniform covers many a faint heart.\nBut as I'm your nearest neighbor I'll introduce myself. My name's\nWisk.\"\n\n\"My name is Twinkle.\"\n\n\"And mine's Chubbins.\"\n\n\"Pleased to make your acquaintance,\" said the squirrel, nodding. \"I\nlive in the second flat.\"\n\n\"How's that?\" asked the boy.\n\n\"Why, the second hollow, you know. There's a 'possum living in the\nhollow down below, who is carrying four babies around in her pocket;\nand Mrs. Hootaway, the gray owl, lives in the hollow above--the one you\ncan see far over your heads. So I'm the second flat tenant.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Twinkle.\n\n\"Early in the morning the 'possum comes growling home to go to bed;\nlate at night the owl hoots and keeps folks awake; but I'm very quiet\nand well behaved, and you'll find me a good neighbor,\" continued Wisk.\n\n\"I'm sure of that,\" said Chubbins.\n\nAs if to prove his friendship the squirrel now darted out of the hollow\nand sat upon a limb beside the children, holding his bushy tail\nstraight up so that it stood above his head like a big plume in a\nsoldier's helmet.\n\n\"Are you hungry?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"Not very. I cannot get much food until the nuts are ripe, you know,\nand my last winter's supply was gone long ago. But I manage to find\nsome bits to eat, here and there.\"\n\n\"Do you like cookies?\" she asked.\n\n\"I really do not know,\" answered Wisk. \"Where do they grow?\"\n\n\"In baskets. I'll get you a piece, and you can try it.\" So Twinkle flew\nup and crept into her basket again, quickly returning with a bit of\ncookie in her claw. It was not much more than a crumb, but nevertheless\nit was all that she could carry.\n\nThe squirrel seized the morsel in his paws, examined it gravely, and\nthen took a nibble. An instant later it was gone.\n\n\"That is very good, indeed!\" he declared. \"Where do these baskets of\ncookies grow?\"\n\n\"They don't grow anywhere,\" replied Twinkle, with a laugh. \"The baskets\ncome from the grocery store, and my mama makes the cookies.\"\n\n\"Oh; they're human food, then.\"\n\n\"Yes; would you like some more?\"\n\n\"Not just now,\" said Wisk. \"I don't want to rob you, and it is foolish\nto eat more than one needs, just because the food tastes good. But if I\nget very hungry, perhaps I'll ask you for another bite.\"\n\n\"Do,\" said the girl. \"You are welcome to what we have, as long as it\nlasts.\"\n\n\"That is very kind of you,\" returned the squirrel.\n\nThey sat and talked for an hour, and Wisk told them stories of the\nforest, and of the many queer animals and birds that lived there. It\nwas all very interesting to the children, and they listened eagerly\nuntil they heard a rushing sound in the air that sent Wisk scurrying\nback into his hole.\n\n\n\n[CHAPTER IV] _An Afternoon Reception_\n\nTwinkle and Chubbins stretched their little necks to see what was\ncoming, and a moment later beheld one of the most gorgeous sights the\nforest affords--a procession of all the bright-hued birds that live\namong the trees or seek them for shelter.\n\nThey flew in pairs, one after the other, and at the head of the\nprocession was their good friend Policeman Bluejay, wearing a\npoliceman's helmet upon his head and having a policeman's club tucked\nunderneath his left wing. The helmet was black and glossy and had a big\nnumber \"1\" on the front of it, and a strap that passed under the\nwearer's bill and held it firmly in place. The club was fastened around\nthe policeman's wing with a cord, so that it could not get away when he\nwas flying.\n\nThe birds were of many sizes and of various colorings. Some were much\nlarger than the bluejay, but none seemed so proud or masterful, and all\ndeferred meekly to the commands of the acknowledged guardian of the\nforest.\n\nOne by one the pretty creatures alighted upon the limbs of the tree,\nand the first thing they all did was to arrange their feathers properly\nafter their rapid flight. Then the bluejay, who sat next to the\nchild-larks, proceeded to introduce the guests he had brought to call\nupon the newest inhabitants of his domain.\n\n\"This is Mr. and Mrs. Robin Redbreast, one of our most aristocratic\nfamilies,\" said he, swinging his club around in a circle until Chubbins\nducked his head for fear it might hit him.\n\n\"You are welcome to our forest,\" chirped Robin, in a sedate and\ndignified tone.\n\n\"And here is Mr. Goldfinch and his charming bride,\" continued the\npoliceman.\n\n\"Ah, it is a pleasure to meet you,\" the goldfinch murmured, eyeing the\nchild-larks curiously, but trying to be so polite that they would not\nnotice his staring.\n\n\"Henny Wren and Jenny Wren,\" proceeded the policeman.\n\nTwinkle and Chubbins both bowed politely.\n\n\"Well, well!\" croaked a raven, in a hoarse voice, \"am I to wait all day\nwhile you introduce those miserable little insignificant grub-eaters?\"\n\n\"Be quiet!\" cried Policeman Bluejay, sternly.\n\n\"I won't,\" snapped the raven.\n\nIt happened so quickly that the children saw nothing before they heard\nthe thump of the club against the raven's head.\n\n\"Caw--waw--waw--waw! Murder! Help!\" screamed the big bird, and flew\naway from the tree as swiftly as his ragged wings would carry him.\n\n\"Let him go,\" said a sweet brown mocking-bird. \"The rowdy is always\ndisturbing our social gatherings, and no one will miss him if he\ndoesn't come back.\"\n\n\"He is not fit for polite society,\" added a nuthatcher, pruning her\nscarlet wings complacently.\n\nSo the policeman tucked the club under his wing again and proceeded\nwith the introductions, the pewees and the linnets being next presented\nto the strangers, and then the comical little chicadees, the orioles,\nbobolinks, thrushes, starlings and whippoorwills, the latter appearing\nsleepy because, they explained, they had been out late the night\nbefore.\n\nThese smaller birds all sat in rows on the limbs beside Twinkle and\nChubbins; but seated upon the stouter limbs facing them were rows of\nbigger birds who made the child-larks nervous by the sharp glances from\ntheir round, bright eyes. Here were blackbirds, cuckoos, magpies,\ngrosbeaks and wood-pigeons, all nearly as big and fierce-looking as\nPoliceman Bluejay himself, and some so rugged and strong that it seemed\nstrange they would submit to the orders of the officer of the law. But\nthe policeman kept a sharp watch upon these birds, to see that they\nattempted no mischievous pranks, and they must have been afraid of him\nbecause they behaved very well after the saucy raven had left them.\nEven the chattering magpies tried to restrain their busy tongues, and\nthe blackbirds indulged in no worse pranks than to suddenly spread\ntheir wings and try to push the pigeons off the branch.\n\nSeveral beautiful humming-birds were poised in the air above this\ngathering, their bodies being motionless but their tiny wings\nfluttering so swiftly that neither Twinkle nor Chubbins could see them\nat all.\n\nPoliceman Bluejay, having finally introduced all the company to the\nchild-larks, began to relate the story of their adventures, telling the\nbirds how the wicked tuxix had transformed them into the remarkable\nshapes they now possessed.\n\n\"For the honor of our race,\" he said, \"we must each and every one guard\nthese little strangers carefully, and see that they come to no harm in\nour forest. You must all pledge yourselves to befriend them on all\noccasions, and if any one dares to break his promise he must fight with\nme to the death--and you know very well what that means.\"\n\n\"We do,\" said a magpie, with a shrill laugh. \"You'll treat us as you\ndid Jim Crow. Eh?\"\n\nThe policeman did not notice this remark, but the other birds all\nlooked grave and thoughtful, and began in turn to promise that they\nwould take care to befriend the child-larks at all times. This ceremony\nhaving been completed, the birds began to converse in a more friendly\nand easy tone, so that Twinkle and Chubbins soon ceased to be afraid of\nthem, and enjoyed very much their society and friendly chatter.\n\n\n\n[CHAPTER V] _The Oriole's Story_\n\n\"We are really very happy in this forest,\" said an oriole that sat next\nto Twinkle, \"and we would have no fears at all did not the men with\nguns, who are called hunters, come here now and then to murder us. They\nare terribly wild and ferocious creatures, who have no hearts at all.\"\n\n\"Oh, they _must_ have hearts,\" said Twinkle, \"else they couldn't live.\nFor one's heart has to beat to keep a person alive, you know.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it's their gizzards that beat,\" replied the oriole,\nreflectively, \"for they are certainly heartless and very wicked. A\ncousin of mine, Susie Oriole, had a very brave and handsome husband.\nThey built a pretty nest together and Susie laid four eggs in it that\nwere so perfect that she was very proud of them.\n\n\"The eggs were nearly ready to hatch when a great man appeared in the\nforest and discovered Susie's nest. Her brave husband fought\ndesperately to protect their home, but the cruel man shot him, and he\nfell to the ground dead. Even then Susie would not leave her pretty\neggs, and when the man climbed the tree to get them she screamed and\ntried to peck out his eyes. Usually we orioles are very timid, you\nknow; so you can well understand how terrified Susie was to fight\nagainst this giant foe. But he had a club in his hand, with which he\ndealt my poor cousin such a dreadful blow that she was sent whirling\nthrough the air and sank half unconscious into a bush a few yards away.\n\n\"After this the man stole the eggs from the nest, and also picked up\nthe dead body of Susie's husband and carried it away with him. Susie\nrecovered somewhat from the blow she had received, and when she saw her\neggs and her poor dead husband being taken away, she managed to flutter\nalong after the man and followed him until he came to the edge of the\nforest. There he had a horse tied to a tree, and he mounted upon the\nbeast's back and rode away through the open country. Susie followed\nhim, just far enough away to keep the man in sight, without being\nnoticed herself.\n\n\"By and bye he came to a big house, which he entered, closing the door\nbehind him. Susie flew into a tree beside the house and waited\nsorrowfully but in patience for a chance to find her precious ones\nagain.\n\n\"The days passed drearily away, one after another, but in about a week\nmy cousin noticed that one of the windows of the house had been left\nopen. So she boldly left her tree and flew in at the window, and\nluckily none of the people who lived in the house happened to be in the\nroom.\n\n\"Imagine Susie's surprise when she saw around the sides of the room\nmany birds sitting silently upon limbs cut from trees, and among them\nher own husband, as proud and beautiful as he had ever been before the\ncruel man had killed him! She quickly flew to the limb and perched\nbeside her loved one.\n\n\"'Oh, my darling!' she cried, 'how glad I am to have found you again,\nand to see you alive and well when I had mourned you as dead. Come with\nme at once, and we will return to our old home in the forest.'\n\n\"But the bird remained motionless and made no reply to her loving\nwords. She thrust her bill beside his and tried to kiss him, but he did\nnot respond to the caress and his body was stiff and cold.\n\n\"Then Susie uttered a cry of grief, and understood the truth. Her\nhusband was indeed dead, but had been stuffed and mounted upon the limb\nto appear as he had in life. Small wires had been pushed through his\nlegs to make his poor body stand up straight, and to Susie's horror she\ndiscovered that his eyes were only bits of glass! All the other birds\nin the room were stuffed in the same way. They looked as if they were\nalive, at the first glance; but each body was cold and every voice\nmute. They were mere mockeries of the beautiful birds that this\nheartless and cruel man had deprived of their joyous lives.\n\n\"Susie's loving heart was nearly bursting with pain as she slowly\nfluttered toward the open window by which she had entered. But on her\nway a new anguish overtook her, for she noticed a big glass case\nagainst the wall in which were arranged clusters of eggs stolen from\nbirds of almost every kind. Yes; there were her own lovely eggs,\nscarcely an inch from her face, but separated from her by a stout glass\nthat could not be broken, although she madly dashed her body against it\nagain and again.\n\n\"Finally, realizing her helplessness, poor Susie left the room by the\nopen window and flew back to the forest, where she told us all the\nterrible thing she had seen. No one was able to comfort her, for her\nloving heart was broken; and after that she would often fly away to the\nhouse to peer through the window at her eggs and her beautiful husband.\n\n\"One day she did not return, and after waiting for her nearly two weeks\nwe sent the bluejay to see what had become of her. Our policeman found\nthe house, and also found the window of the room open.\n\n\"He boldly entered, and discovered Susie and her husband sitting side\nby side upon the dried limb, their bodies both stiff and dead. The man\nhad caught the poor wife at last, and the lovers were reunited in\ndeath.\n\n\"Also Policeman Bluejay found his grandfather's mummy in this room, and\nthe stuffed mummies of many other friends he had known in the forest.\nSo he was very sorrowful when he returned to us, and from that time we\nhave feared the heartless men more than ever.\"\n\n\"It's a sad story,\" sighed Twinkle, \"and I've no doubt it is a true\none. But all men are not so bad, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"All men who enter the forest are,\" answered the oriole, positively.\n\"For they only come here to murder and destroy those who are helpless\nbefore their power, but have never harmed them in the least. If God\nloves the birds, as I am sure He does, why do you suppose He made their\nferocious enemies, the men?\"\n\nTwinkle did not reply, but she felt a little ashamed.\n\n\n\n[CHAPTER VI] _A Merry Adventure_\n\n\"Talking about men,\" said the cuckoo, in a harsh but not very\nunpleasant voice, \"reminds me of a funny adventure I once had myself. I\nwas sitting in my nest one day, at the time when I was quite young,\nwhen suddenly a man appeared before me. You must know that this nest,\nwhich was rather carelessly built by my mother, was in a thick\nevergreen tree, and not very high from the ground; so that I found the\nman's eyes staring squarely into my own.\n\n\"Most of you, my dears, have seen men; but this was the strangest sort\nof man you can imagine. There was white hair upon his face, so long\nthat it hung down to his middle, and over his eyes were round plates\nof glass that glittered very curiously. I was so astonished at seeing\nthe queer creature that I sat still and stared, and this was my\nundoing. For suddenly there came a rapid 'whish!' through the air, and\na network of cords fell all around and over me. Then, indeed, I spread\nmy wings and attempted to fly; but it was too late. I struggled in the\nnet without avail, and soon gave up the conflict in breathless despair.\n\n\"My captor did not intend to kill me, however. Instead, he tried to\nsoothe my fright, and carried me very gently for many, many miles,\nuntil we came to a village of houses. Here, at the very top of a high\nhouse, the man lived in one little room. It was all littered with tools\nand bits of wood, and on a broad shelf were several queer things that\nwent 'tick-tock! tick-tock!' every minute. I was thrust, gently enough,\ninto a wooden cage, where I lay upon the bottom more dead than alive\nbecause the ticking things at first scared me dreadfully and I was in\nconstant terror lest I should be tortured or killed. But the glass-eyed\nold man brought me dainty things to eat, and plenty of fresh water to\nrelieve my thirst, and by the next day my heart had stopped going\npitty-pat and I was calm enough to stand up in my cage and look around\nme.\n\n\"My white-whiskered captor sat at a bench with his coat off and his\nbald head bare, while he worked away busily putting little wheels and\nsprings together, and fitting them into a case of wood. When one of\nthem was finished it would sing 'tick-tock! tick-tock!' just like the\nother queer things on the shelf, and this constant ticking so\ninterested me that I raised my head and called:\n\n\"'Cuck-oo! cuck-oo!'\"\n\n\"'That's it!' cried the old man, delightedly. 'That's what I wanted to\nhear. It's the real cuckoo at last, and not a bit like those cheap\nimitations.'\n\n\"I didn't understand at first what he meant, but he worked at his bench\nall day, and finally brought to my cage a bird made out of wood, that\nwas carved and painted to look just as I was. It seemed so natural that\nI flapped my wings and called 'cuck-oo' to it, and the man pressed a\nlittle bellows at the bottom of the bird and made it say 'cuck-oo!' in\nreturn. But that cry was so false and unreal that I just shouted with\nlaughter, and the glass-eyed old man shook his head sadly and said:\n'That will never do. That will never do in the world.'\n\n\"So all the next day he worked hard trying to make his wooden bird say\n'cuck-oo!' in the proper way; and at last it really spoke quite\nnaturally, so that it startled even me when I heard it. This seemed to\nplease my captor very much; so he put it inside one of the ticking\nthings on the shelf, and by-and-by a door opened and the wooden bird\njumped out and cried 'Cuck-oo! Cuck-oo! Cuck-oo!' and then jumped back\nagain and the door closed with a snap.\n\n\"'Bravo!' cried old white-hair; but I was rather annoyed, for I thought\nthe wooden bird was impudent in trying to ape the ways of live cuckoos.\nI shouted back a challenge to it, but there was no reply. An hour\nlater, and every hour, it repeated the performance, but jumped behind\nthe door when I offered to fight it.\n\n\"The next day the man was absent from the room, and I had nothing to\neat. So I became angry and uneasy. I scratched away at the wooden bars\nof my cage and tried to twist them with my beak, and at last one of\nthem, to my great joy, came loose, and I was able to squeeze myself out\nof the cage.\n\n\"But then I was no better off than before, because the windows and the\ndoor of the room were fast shut. I grew more cross and ill-tempered\nthan before, when I discovered this, and to add to my annoyance that\nmiserable wooden bird would every once in awhile jump out and yell\n'Cuck-oo!' and then bounce back into its house again, without daring to\nargue with me.\n\n\"This at last made me frantic with rage, and I resolved to be revenged.\nThe next time the wooden bird made its appearance I new upon it in a\nflash and knocked it off the little platform before it had uttered its\ncry more than twice. It fell upon the floor and broke one of its wings;\nbut in an instant I dashed myself upon it and bit and scratched the\nimpudent thing until there was not a bit of paint left upon it. Its\nhead came off, too, and so did its legs and the other wing, and before\nI was done with it no one ever would have known it was once a clever\nimitation of myself. Finding that I was victorious I cried 'Cuck-oo!'\nin triumph, and just then the little door of the ticking thing opened\nand the platform where the wooden bird had stood came out of it and\nremained for a time motionless. I quickly flew up and perched upon it,\nand shouted 'Cuck-oo!' again, in great glee. As I did so, to my\namazement the platform on which I stood leaped backward, carrying me\nwith it, and the next instant the door closed with a snap and I found\nmyself in darkness.\n\n\"Wildly I fluttered my wings; but it was of no use. I was in a prison\nmuch worse than the cage, and so small that I could hardly turn around\nin it. I was about to die of terror and despair when I chanced to\nremember that at certain times the door would open to push out the bird\nand allow it to say 'Cuck-oo!' before it shut again. So, the next time\nit opened in this way, I would be able to make my escape.\n\n\"Very patiently I waited in the dark little hole, listening to the\nsteady 'tick-tock!' of the machinery behind me and trying not to be\nnervous. After awhile I heard the old man come into the room and\nexclaim sorrowfully because his captive cuckoo had escaped from its\ncage. He could not imagine what had become of me, and I kept still and\nlaughed to myself to think how I would presently surprise him.\n\n\"It seemed an age before I finally heard the click that opened the door\nin front of me. Then the platform on which I sat sprang out, and I\nfluttered my wings and yelled 'Cuck-oo! Cuck-oo!' as loud as I could.\nThe old man was standing right in front of me, his mouth wide open with\nastonishment at the wonderfully natural performance of his wooden bird,\nas he thought me. He shouted 'Bravo!' again, and clapped his hands; and\nat that I flew straight into his face, and clawed his white hair with\nall my might, and screamed as loud as I could.\n\n\"He screamed, too, being taken by surprise, and tumbled over backward\nso that he sat down upon the floor with a loud bump. I flew to the\nwork-bench, and then the truth dawned upon him that I was not the\nwooden bird but the real one.\n\n\"'Good gracious!' said he, 'I've left the window open. The rascal will\nescape!'\n\n\"I glanced at the window and saw that it was indeed wide open. The\nsight filled me with triumphant joy. Before the old man could get upon\nhis feet and reach the window I had perched upon the sill, and with one\nparting cry of 'Cuck-oo!' I spread my wings and flew straight into the\nair.\n\n\"Well, I never went back to enquire if he enjoyed the trick I had\nplayed upon him, but I've laughed many a time when I thought of the old\nfellow's comic expression when a real cuckoo instead of a painted one\nflew out of his ticking machine.\"\n\nAs the cuckoo ended his tale the other birds joined in a chorus of\nshrill laughter; but Chubbins said to them, gravely:\n\n\"He was a smart man, though, to make a cuckoo-clock. I saw one myself,\none time, and it was a wonderful thing. The cuckoo told what time it\nwas every hour.\"\n\n\"Was it made of wood?\" asked the bluejay.\n\n\"I don't know that,\" replied the boy-lark; \"but of course it wasn't a\nreal bird.\"\n\n\"It only shows,\" remarked the bobolink, \"how greatly those humans\nadmire us birds. They make pictures of us, and love to keep us in cages\nso they can hear us sing, and they even wear us in their bonnets after\nwe are dead.\"\n\n\"I think that is a dreadful thing,\" said the goldfinch, with a shudder.\n\"But it only proves that men are our greatest enemies.\"\n\n\"Don't forget the women,\" said Twinkle. \"It's the women that wear birds\nin their hats.\"\n\n\"Mankind,\" said Robin Redbreast, gravely, \"is the most destructive and\nbloodthirsty of all the brute creation. They not only kill for food,\nbut through vanity and a desire for personal adornment. I have even\nheard it said that they kill for amusement, being unable to restrain\ntheir murderous desires. In this they are more cruel than the\nserpents.\"\n\n\"There is some excuse for the poor things,\" observed the bluejay, \"for\nnature created them dependent upon the animals and birds and fishes.\nHaving neither fur nor feathers to protect their poor skinny bodies,\nthey wear clothing made of the fleece of sheep, and skins of seals and\nbeavers and otters and even the humble muskrats. They cover their feet\nand their hands with skins of beasts; they sleep upon the feathers of\nbirds; their food is the flesh of beasts and birds and fishes. No\ncreated thing is so dependent upon others as man; therefore he is the\ngreatest destroyer in the world. But he is not alone in his murderous,\ndespoiling instinct. While you rail at man, my friends, do not forget\nthat birds are themselves the greatest enemies of birds.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" cried the magpie, indignantly.\n\n\"Perhaps the less you say about this matter the better,\" declared the\nbluejay, swinging his club in a suggestive manner, and looking sharply\nat the magpie.\n\n\"It's a slander,\" said the blackbird. \"I'm sure you can't accuse _me_\nof injuring birds in any way.\"\n\n\"If you are all innocent, why are we obliged to have a policeman?\"\nenquired the little wren, in a nervous voice.\n\n\"Tell me,\" said Twinkle, appealing to the bluejay; \"are the big birds\nreally naughty to the little ones?\"\n\n\"Why, it is the same with us as it is with men,\" replied the policeman.\n\"There are good ones and bad ones among us, and the bad ones have to be\nwatched. Men destroy us wantonly; other animals and the sly serpents\nprey upon us and our eggs for food; but these are open enemies, and we\nknow how we may best avoid them. Our most dangerous foes are those\nbandits of our own race who, instead of protecting their brethren,\nsteal our eggs and murder our young. They are not always the biggest\nbirds, by any means, that do these things. The crow family is known to\nbe treacherous, and the shrike is rightly called the 'butcher-bird,'\nbut there are many others that we have reason to suspect feed upon\ntheir own race.\"\n\n\"How dreadful!\" exclaimed the girl-lark.\n\nThe birds all seemed restless and uneasy at this conversation, and\nlooked upon one another with suspicious glances. But the bluejay\nsoothed them by saying:\n\n\"After all, I suppose we imagine more evil than really exists, and\nsometimes accuse our neighbors wrongfully. But the mother birds know\nhow often their nests have been robbed in their absence, and if they\nsuspect some neighbor of the crime instead of a prowling animal it is\nbut natural, since many birds cannot be trusted. There are laws in the\nforest, of course; but the guilty ones are often able to escape. I'll\ntell you of a little tragedy that happened only last week, which will\nprove how apt we are to be mistaken.\"\n\n\n\n[CHAPTER VII] _The Bluejay's Story_\n\n\"There is no more faithful mother in the forest than the blue titmouse,\nwhich is a cousin to the chickadee,\" continued the policeman, \"and this\nspring Tom Titmouse and his wife Nancy set up housekeeping in a little\nhollow in an elm-tree about half a mile north of this spot. Of course,\nthe first thing Nancy did was to lay six beautiful eggs--white with\nbrown spots all over them--in the nest. Tom was as proud of these eggs\nas was Nancy, and as the nest was hidden in a safe place they flew away\ntogether to hunt for caterpillars, and had no thought of danger. But on\ntheir return an hour later what was their sorrow to find the nest\nempty, and every pretty egg gone. On the ground underneath the tree\nwere scattered a few bits of shell; but the robber was nowhere to be\nseen.\n\n\"Tom Titmouse was very indignant at this dreadful crime, and came to me\nat once to complain of the matter; but of course I had no idea who had\ndone the deed. I questioned all the birds who have ever been known to\nslyly steal eggs, and every one denied the robbery. So Nancy Titmouse\nsaw she must lay more eggs, and before long had another six speckled\nbeauties in the bottom of her nest.\n\n\"They were more careful now about leaving home; but the danger seemed\npast. One bright, sunny morning they ventured to fly to the brook to\ndrink and bathe themselves, and on their return found their home\ndespoiled for a second time. Not an egg was left to them out of the\nsix, and while Nancy wept and wailed Tom looked sharply around him and\nsaw a solitary shrike sitting on a limb not far away.\"\n\n\"What's a shrike?\" asked Chubbins.\n\n\"It is a bird that looks a good deal like that mocking-bird sitting\nnext you; but it bears a bad character in the forest and has earned the\nvile name of 'butcher-bird.' I admit that I am always obliged to keep\nan eye upon the shrike, for I expect it to get into mischief at any\ntime. Well, Tom Titmouse naturally thought the shrike had eaten Nancy's\neggs, so he came to me and ordered me to arrest the robber. But the\nshrike pleaded his innocence, and I had no proof against him.\n\n\"Again Nancy, with true motherly courage and perseverance, laid her\neggs in the nest; and now they were never left alone for a single\nminute. Either she or Tom was always at home, and for my part I watched\nthe shrike carefully and found he did not fly near the nest of the\ntitmice at all.\n\n\"The result of our care was that one fine day the eggs hatched out, and\nsix skinny little titmice, with big heads and small bodies, were\nnestling against Nancy's breast. The mother thought they were\nbeautiful, you may be sure, and many birds gathered around to\ncongratulate her and Tom, and the brown thrush sang a splendid song of\nwelcome to the little ones.\n\n\"When the children got a little stronger it did not seem necessary to\nguard the nest so closely, and the six appetites required a good many\ninsects and butterfly-eggs to satisfy them. So Tom and Nancy both flew\naway to search for food, and when they came back they found, to their\nhorror, that their six little ones had been stolen, and the nest was\nbare and cold. Nancy nearly fainted with sorrow, and her cries were\npitiful and heart-rending; but Tom Titmouse was dreadfully angry, and\ncame to me demanding vengeance.\n\n\"'If you are any good at all as a policeman,' said he, 'you will\ndiscover and punish the murderer of my babies.'\n\n\"So I looked all around and finally discovered, not far from the nest\nof the titmice, four of their children, all dead and each one impaled\nupon the thorn of a bush that grew close to the ground. Then I decided\nit was indeed the shrike, for he has a habit of doing just this thing;\nkilling more than he can eat and sticking the rest of his murdered\nvictims on thorns until he finds time to come back and devour them.\n\n\"I was also angry, by that time; so I flew to the shrike's nest and\nfound him all scratched and torn and his feathers plucked in many\nplaces.\n\n\"'What has happened to you?' I asked.\n\n\"'I had a fight with a weasel last night,' answered the shrike, 'and\nboth of us are rather used up, today.'\n\n\"'Still,' said I, sternly, 'you had strength enough to kill the six\nlittle titmice, and to eat two of them.'\n\n\"'I never did,' said he, earnestly; 'my wings are too stiff to fly.'\n\n\"'Do not lie about it, I beg of you,' said I; 'for we have found four\nof the dead titmice stuck on the thorns of a bush, and your people have\nbeen known to do such things before.'\n\n\"At this the shrike looked worried.\n\n\"'Really,' said he, 'I cannot understand it. But I assure you I am\ninnocent.'\n\n\"Nevertheless, I arrested him, and made him fly with me to the Judgment\nTree, where all the birds had congregated. He was really stiff and\nsore, and I could see it hurt him to fly; but my duty was plain. We\nselected a jury of twelve birds, and Judge Bullfinch took his seat on a\nbough, and then the trial began.\n\n\"Tom Titmouse accused the shrike of murder, and so did Nancy, who had\nnearly cried her eyes out. I also gave my evidence. But the prisoner\ninsisted strongly that he was innocent, and claimed he had not left his\nnest since his fight with the weasel, and so was guiltless of the\ncrime.\n\n\"But no one had any sympathy for him, or believed what he said; for it\nis often the case that when one has earned a bad character he is\nthought capable of any wickedness. So the jury declared him guilty, and\nthe judge condemned him to die at sundown. We were all to fall upon the\nprisoner together, and tear him into bits with bill and claw; but while\nwe waited for the sun to sink Will Sparrow flew up to the Judgment Tree\nand said:\n\n\"'Hello! What's going on here?'\n\n\"'We are just about to execute a criminal,' replied the judge.\n\n\"'What has he been doing?' asked Will, eyeing the shrike curiously.\n\n\"'He killed the titmice children this morning, and ate two of them, and\nstuck the other four upon a thorn bush,' explained the judge.\n\n\"'Oh, no; the shrike did not do that!' cried Will Sparrow. 'I saw the\ncrime committed with my own eyes, and it was the cunning weasel--the\none that lives in the pine stump--that did the dreadful murder.'\n\n\"At this all the birds set up an excited chatter, and the shrike again\nscreamed that he was innocent. So the judge said, gravely: 'Will\nSparrow always speaks the truth. Release the prisoner, for we have\nmisjudged him. We must exact our vengeance upon the weasel.'\n\n\"So we all flew swiftly to the pine stump, which we knew well, and when\nwe arrived we found the weasel sitting at the edge of his hole and\nlaughing at us.\n\n\"'That is the very weasel I fought with,' said the shrike. 'You can see\nwhere I tore the fur from his head and back with my sharp beak.'\n\n\"'So you did,' answered the weasel; 'and in return I killed the little\ntomtits.'\n\n\"'Did you stick them on the thorns?' asked Judge Bullfinch.\n\n\"'Yes,' said the weasel. 'I hoped you would accuse the shrike of the\nmurder, and kill him to satisfy my vengeance.'\n\n\"'We nearly fell into the trap,' returned the judge; 'but Will Sparrow\nsaw your act and reported it just in time to save the shrike's life.\nBut tell me, did you also eat Nancy Titmouse's eggs?'\n\n\"'Of course,' confessed the weasel, 'and they were very good, indeed.'\n\n\"Hearing this, Tom Titmouse became so excited that he made a furious\ndash at the weasel, who slipped within his hole and escaped.\n\n\"'I condemn you to death!' cried the judge.\n\n\"'That's all right,' answered the weasel, sticking just the tip of his\nnose out of the hole. 'But you've got to catch me before you can kill\nme. Run home, my pretty birds. You're no match for a weasel!'\n\n\"Then he was gone from sight, and we knew he was hidden safely in the\nstump, where we could not follow him, for the weasel's body is slim and\nslender. But I have not lived in the forest all my life without\nlearning something, and I whispered a plan to Judge Bullfinch that met\nwith his approval. He sent messengers at once for the ivory-billed\nwoodpeckers, and soon four of those big birds appeared and agreed to\nhelp us. They began tearing away at the stump with their strong beaks,\nand the splinters flew in every direction. It was not yet dark when the\ncunning weasel was dragged from his hole and was at the mercy of the\nbirds he had so cruelly offended. We fell upon him in a flash, and he\nwas dead almost instantly.\"\n\n\"What became of the shrike?\" asked Twinkle.\n\n\"He left the forest the next day,\" answered Policeman Bluejay. \"For\nalthough he was innocent of this crime, he was still a butcher-bird,\nand he knew our people had no confidence in him.\"\n\n\"It was lucky Will Sparrow came in time,\" said the girl-lark. \"But all\nthese stories must have made you hungry, so I'd like to invite my\nguests to have some refreshments.\"\n\nThe birds seemed much surprised by this invitation, and even Policeman\nBluejay wondered what she was going to do. But Twinkle whispered to\nChubbins, and both the bird-children flew into their basket and\nreturned with their claws full of cookie. They repeated the journey\nmany times, distributing bits of the rare food to all of the birds who\nhad visited them, and each one ate the morsel eagerly and declared that\nit was very good.\n\n\"Now,\" said the policeman, when the feast was over, \"let us all go to\nthe brook and have a drink of its clear, sweet water.\"\n\nSo they flew away, a large and merry band of all sizes and colors; and\nthe child-larks joined them, skimming the air as lightly and joyously\nas any of their new friends. It did not take them long to reach a\nsparkling brook that wound its way through the forest, and all the\nfeathered people drank their fill standing upon the low bank or upon\nstones that rose above the level of the water.\n\nAt first the children were afraid they might fall into the brook; but\npresently they gained courage, and when they saw the thrush and\nbullfinch plunge in and bathe themselves in the cool water Chubbins\ndecided to follow their example, and afterward Twinkle also joined\nthem.\n\nThe birds now bade the child-larks good-bye and promised to call upon\nthem again, and soon all had flown away except the bluejay, who said he\nwould see Twinkle and Chubbins safe home again, so that they would not\nget lost.\n\nThey thanked him for this kindness, and when they had once more settled\nupon the limb beside their nest the bluejay also bade them good night\nand darted away for one last look through the forest to see that all\nwas orderly for the night.\n\n\n\n[CHAPTER VIII] _Mrs. Hootaway_\n\nAs the child-larks sat side by side upon their limb, with the soft gray\nnest near at hand, the twilight fell and a shadow began to grow and\ndeepen throughout the forest.\n\n\"Twink,\" said Chubbins, gravely, \"how do you like it?\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied the girl, \"it isn't so bad in the daytime, but it's\nworse at night. That bunch of grass mixed up with the stems of leaves,\nthat they call a nest, isn't much like my pretty white bed at home,\nChubbins.\"\n\n\"Nor mine,\" he agreed. \"And, Twink, how ever can we say our prayers\nwhen we haven't any hands to hold up together?\"\n\n\"Prayers, Chub,\" said the girl, \"are more in our hearts than in our\nhands. It isn't what we _do_ that counts; it's what we feel. But the\nmost that bothers me is what the folks at home will think, when we\ndon't come back.\"\n\n\"They'll hunt for us,\" Chubbins suggested; \"and they may come under\nthis tree, and call to us.\"\n\n\"If they do,\" said Twinkle, \"we'll fly right down to them.\"\n\n\"I advise you not to fly much, in the night,\" said a cheery voice\nbeside them, and Wisk the squirrel stuck his head out of the hollow\nwhere he lived. \"You've had quite a party here today,\" he continued,\n\"and they behaved pretty well while the policeman was around. But some\nof them might not be so friendly if you met them alone.\"\n\n\"Would any bird hurt us?\" asked the girl, in surprise.\n\n\"Why, I've seen a magpie meet a thrush, and fly away alone,\" replied\nWisk. \"And the wrens and chickadees avoid the cuckoo as much as\npossible, because they are fond of being alive. But the policeman keeps\nthe big birds all in order when he is around, and he makes them all\nafraid to disobey the laws. He's a wonderful fellow, that Policeman\nBluejay, and even we squirrels are glad he is in the forest.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Chubbins.\n\n\"Well, we also fear some of the birds,\" answered Wisk. \"The lady in the\nthird flat, for instance, Mrs. Hootaway, is said to like a squirrel for\na midnight meal now and then, when mice and beetles are scarce. It is\nalmost her hour for wakening, so I must be careful to keep near home.\"\n\n\"Tut--tut--tut!\" cried a harsh voice from above. \"What scandal is this\nyou are talking, Mr. Wisk?\"\n\nThe squirrel was gone in a flash; but a moment later he put out his\nhead again and turned one bright eye toward the upper part of the tree.\nThere, on a perch outside her hollow, sat the gray owl, pruning her\nfeathers. It was nearly dark by this time, and through the dusk Mrs.\nHootaway's yellow eyes could be seen gleaming bright and wide open.\n\n\"What nonsense are you putting into the heads of these little\ninnocents?\" continued the owl, in a scolding tone.\n\n\"No nonsense at all,\" said Wisk, in reply. \"The child-larks are safe\nenough from you, because they are under the protection of Policeman\nBluejay, and he would have a fine revenge if you dared to hurt them.\nBut my case is different. The laws of the birds do not protect\nsquirrels, and when you're abroad, my dear Mrs. Hootaway, I prefer to\nremain snugly at home.\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" remarked the owl, with a laugh. \"You are timid and\nsuspicious by nature, my dear Wisk, and you forget that although I have\nknown you for a long time I have never yet eaten you.\"\n\n\"That is my fault, and not yours,\" retorted the squirrel.\n\n\"Well, I'm not after you tonight, neighbor, nor after birds, either. I\nknow where there are seven fat mice to be had, and until they are all\ngone you may cease to worry.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear that,\" replied Wisk. \"I wish there were seven hundred\nmice to feed your appetite. But I'm not going to run into danger\nrecklessly, nevertheless, and it is my bed-time. So good night, Mrs.\nHootaway; and good night, little child-larks.\" The owl did not reply,\nbut Twinkle and Chubbins called good night to the friendly squirrel,\nand then they hopped into their nest and cuddled down close together.\n\nThe moon was now rising over the trees and flooding the gloom of the\nforest with its subdued silver radiance. The children were not sleepy;\ntheir new life was too strange and wonderful for them to be able to\nclose their eyes at once. So they were rather pleased when the gray owl\nsettled on the branch beside their nest and began to talk to them.\n\n\"I'm used to slanders, my dears,\" she said, in a pleasanter tone than\nshe had used before, \"so I don't mind much what neighbor Wisk says to\nme. But I do not wish you to think ill of the owl family, and so I must\nassure you that we are as gentle and kindly as any feathered creatures\nin the forest--not excepting the Birds of Paradise.\"\n\n\"I am sure of that,\" replied Twinkle, earnestly. \"You are too soft and\nfluffy and pretty to be bad.\"\n\n\"It isn't the prettiness,\" said the gray owl, evidently pleased by the\ncompliment. \"It is the nature of owls to be kind and sympathetic. Those\nwho do not know us very well say harsh things about us, because we fly\nin the night, when most other birds are asleep, and sleep in the\ndaytime when most other birds are awake.\"\n\n\"Why do you do that?\" asked Chubbins.\n\n\"Because the strong light hurts our eyes. But, although we are abroad\nin the night, we seek only our natural prey, and obey the Great Law of\nthe forest more than some others do.\"\n\n\"What is the Great Law?\" enquired Twinkle, curiously.\n\n\"Love. It is the moral law that is above all laws made by living\ncreatures. The whole forest is ruled by love more than it is by fear.\nYou may think this is strange when you remember that some animals eat\nbirds, and some birds eat animals, and the dreadful creeping things eat\nus both; but nevertheless we are so close to Nature here that love and\ntenderness for our kind influences us even more than it does mankind--\nthe careless and unthinking race from which you came. The residents of\nthe forest are good parents, helpful neighbors, and faithful friends.\nWhat better than this could be said of us?\"\n\n\"Nothing, I'm sure, if it is true,\" replied the girl.\n\n\"Over in the Land of Paradise,\" continued the owl, thoughtfully, \"the\nbirds are not obliged to take life in order to live themselves; so they\ncall us savage and fierce. But I believe our natures are as kindly as\nthose of the Birds of Paradise.\"\n\n\"Where is this Land of Paradise you speak of?\" asked Twinkle.\n\n\"Directly in the center of our forest. It is a magical spot, protected\nfrom intrusion not by any wall or barred gates, but by a strong wind\nthat blows all birds away from that magnificent country except the\nBirds of Paradise themselves. There is a legend that man once lived\nthere, but for some unknown crime was driven away. But the birds have\nalways been allowed to inhabit the place because they did no harm.\"\n\n\"I'd like to see it,\" said Chubbins.\n\n\"So would I,\" confessed the gray owl, with a sigh; \"but there is no use\nof my attempting to get into the Paradise of Birds, because the wind\nwould blow me back. But now it is getting quite dark, and I must be off\nto seek my food. Mrs. 'Possum and I have agreed to hunt together,\ntonight.\"\n\n\"Who is Mrs. 'Possum?\" the girl asked.\n\n\"An animal living in the lowest hollow of this tree,\" answered the owl.\n\"She is a good-natured creature, and hunts by night, as I do. She is\nslow, but, being near the ground, she can spy a mouse much quicker than\nI can, and then she calls to me to catch it. So between us we get\nplenty of game and are helpful to each other. The only drawback is that\nMrs. 'Possum has four children, which she carries in her pouch wherever\nshe goes, and they have to be fed as well as their mother. So the\n'possums have five mouths to my one, and it keeps us busy to supply\nthem all.\"\n\n\"It's very kind of you to help her,\" remarked Twinkle.\n\n\"Oh, she helps me, too,\" returned the owl, cheerfully. \"But now good\nnight, my dears. You will probably be sound asleep when I get home\nagain.\"\n\nOff flew Mrs. Hootaway with these words, and her wings moved so\nnoiselessly that she seemed to fade away into the darkness like a\nghost.\n\nThe child-larks sat looking at the silver moon for a time; but\npresently Twinkle's eyelids drooped and she fell fast asleep, and\nChubbins was not long in following her example.\n\n\n\n[CHAPTER IX] _The Destroyers_\n\nA loud shouting and a bang that echoed like a clap of thunder through\nthe forest awoke the bird-children from their dreams.\n\nOpening their eyes with a start they saw that the gray dawn was\nbreaking and a sort of morning twilight made all objects in the forest\ndistinct, yet not so brilliant as the approaching daylight would.\nShadows still lay among the bushes and the thickest branches; but\nbetween the trees the spaces were clearly visible.\n\nThe children, rudely awakened by the riot of noise in their ears, could\ndistinguish the barking of dogs, the shouts of men calling to the\nbrutes, and the scream of an animal in deep distress. Immediately\nafter, there was a whirl overhead and the gray owl settled on the limb\nbeside their nest.\n\n\"They've got her!\" she exclaimed, in a trembling, terrified voice. \"The\nmen have shot Mrs. 'Possum dead, and the dogs are now tearing her four\nbabies limb from limb!\"\n\n\"Where are they?\" whispered Twinkle, her little heart beating as\nviolently as if the dread destroyers had always been her mortal\nenemies.\n\n\"Just below us. Isn't it dreadful? We had such a nice night together,\nand Mrs. 'Possum was so sweet and loving in caring for her little ones\nand feeding them! And, just as we were nearly home again, the dogs\nsprang upon my friend and the men shot her dead. We had not even\nsuspected, until then, that our foes were in the forest.\"\n\nTwinkle and Chubbins craned their necks over the edge of the nest and\nlooked down. On the ground stood a man and a boy, and two great dogs\nwere growling fiercely and tearing some bloody, revolting object with\ntheir cruel jaws.\n\n\"Look out!\" cried the voice of Wisk, the squirrel. \"He's aiming at\nyou--look out!\"\n\nThey ducked their heads again, just as the gun roared and flamed fire\nbeneath them.\n\n\"Oh-h-h!\" wailed Mrs. Hootaway, fluttering violently beside them. \"They\nstruck me that time--the bullet is in my heart. Good-bye, my dears.\nRemember that--all--is love; all is--love!\"\n\nHer voice died away to a whisper, and she toppled from the limb.\nTwinkle and Chubbins tried to save their dying friend from falling, but\nthe gray owl was so much bigger than they that they could not support\nthe weight of her body. Slowly she sank to the ground and fell upon the\nearth with a dull sound that was dreadful to hear.\n\nInstantly Twinkle darted from the nest and swooped downward, alighting\non the ground beside the owl's quivering body. A big dog came bounding\ntoward her. The man was reloading his gun, a few paces away.\n\n\"Call off your dog!\" shouted Twinkle, wildly excited. \"How dare you\nshoot the poor, harmless birds? Call off your dog, I say!\"\n\nBut, even as she spoke, the words sounded in her own ears strange and\nunnatural, and more like the chirping of a bird than the language of\nmen. The hunter either did not hear her or he did not understand her,\nand the dog snarled and bared its wicked teeth as it sprang greedily\nupon the child-lark.\n\nTwinkle was too terrified to move. She glared upon the approaching\nmonster helplessly, and it had almost reached her when a black object\nfell from the skies with the swiftness of a lightning streak and struck\nthe dog's back, tearing the flesh with its powerful talons and driving\na stout, merciless beak straight through the skull of the savage brute.\n\nThe dog, already dead, straightened out and twitched convulsively. The\nman shouted angrily and sprang upon the huge bird that had slain his\npet, at the same time swinging his gun like a club.\n\n\"Quick!\" said the eagle to Twinkle, \"mount with me as swiftly as you\ncan.\"\n\nWith the words he rose into the air and Twinkle darted after him, while\nChubbins, seeing their flight from his nest, joined them just in time\nto escape a shot from the boy's deadly gun.\n\nThe inquisitive squirrel, however, had stuck his head out to see what\nwas happening, and one of the leaden bullets buried itself in his\nbreast. Chubbins saw him fall back into his hollow and heard his\nagonized scream; but he could not stay to help his poor friend. An\ninstant later he had joined the eagle and Twinkle, and was flying as\nhard and swift as his wonderful lark wings could carry him up, up into\nthe blue sky.\n\nThe sunshine touched them now, while below the tragic forest still lay\nburied in gloom.\n\n\"We are quite safe here, for I am sure no shot from a gun could reach\nus,\" said the eagle. \"So let us rest upon our wings for a while. How\nlucky it was that I happened to be around in time to rescue you, my\nlittle friends.\"\n\n\"I am very grateful, indeed,\" answered Twinkle, holding her wings\noutstretched so that she floated lightly in the air beside her rescuer.\n\"If you had been an instant later, the dog would have killed me.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" returned the eagle. \"I saw your danger while I was in the\nair, and determined to act quickly, although I might myself have been\nshot by the man had his gun been loaded. But I have noticed that a bold\naction is often successful because it causes surprise, and the foe does\nnot know what to do.\"\n\n\"I'm 'shamed of those people,\" said Chubbins, indignantly. \"What right\nhad they to come to the forest and kill the pretty owl, and the dear\nlittle squirrel, and the poor mama 'possum and her babies?\"\n\n\"They had the right of power,\" said the eagle, calmly. \"It would be a\nbeautiful world were there no destroyers of life in it; but the earth\nand air and water would then soon become so crowded that there would\nnot be room for them all to exist. Don't blame the men.\"\n\n\"But they are cruel,\" said Twinkle, \"and kill innocent, harmless birds\nand animals, instead of the wicked ones that could be better spared.\"\n\n\"Cruelty is man's nature,\" answered the eagle. \"Of all created things,\nmen, tigers and snakes are known to be the most cruel. From them we\nexpect no mercy. But now, what shall be our next movement? I suppose it\nwill be best for you to keep away from the forest until the men are\ngone. Would you like to visit my home, and meet my wife and children?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed!\" cried Twinkle; \"if you will be kind enough to let us.\"\n\n\"It will be a great pleasure to me,\" said the eagle. \"Follow me\nclosely, please.\"\n\nHe began flying again, and they kept at his side. By and by they\nnoticed a bright, rosy glow coming from a portion of the forest beneath\nthem.\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Chubbins.\n\n\"It is the place called the Paradise of Birds,\" answered their\nconductor. \"It is said to be the most beautiful place in all the world,\nbut no one except the Birds of Paradise are allowed to live there.\nThose favored birds sometimes enter our part of the forest, but we are\nnever allowed to enter theirs.\"\n\n\"I'd like to see that place,\" said Twinkle.\n\n\"Well, you two child-larks are different from all other birds,\"\nremarked the eagle, \"and for that reason perhaps you would be allowed\nto visit the paradise that is forbidden the rest of us. If ever I meet\none of the beautiful birds that live there, I will ask it to grant you\nthe privilege.\"\n\n\"Do!\" said Twinkle and Chubbins, in one eager breath. They flew for a\nlong time, high in the air, but neither of the bird-children seemed to\ntire in the least. They could not go quite as fast as the eagle,\nhowever, who moderated his speed so that they could keep up with him.\n\n\n\n[CHAPTER X] _In the Eagle's Nest_\n\nGradually the forest passed out of sight and only bleak, rugged\nmountains were below them. One peak rose higher than the others, and\nfaced the sea, and to this point the great eagle directed their flight.\n\nOn a crag that jutted out from the mountain was the eagle's nest, made\nof rude sticks of wood gathered from the forest. Sitting beside the\nnest was Mrs. Eagle, larger and more pompous even than her husband,\nwhile squatting upon the edge of the nest were two half-grown eaglets\nwith enormous claws and heads, but rather skinny bodies that were\ncovered with loose and ragged feathers. Neither the nest nor the\neaglets appeared to be very clean, and a disagreeable smell hung over\nthe place.\n\n\"This is funny,\" said Mrs. Eagle, looking at the child-larks with\nsurprise. \"Usually you kill your game before you bring it home,\nJonathan; but today it seems our dinner has flown to us willingly.\"\n\n\"They're for us!\" cried one of the eaglets, making a quick dash to\nseize Twinkle, who darted out of his reach.\n\n\"One for each of us!\" screamed the other eaglet, rushing at Chubbins.\n\n\"Peace--be quiet!\" said the eagle, sternly. \"Cannot you tell friends\nfrom food, you foolish youngsters? These are two little friends of mine\nwhom I have invited to visit us; so you must treat them in a civil\nmanner.\"\n\n\"Why not eat them?\" asked one of the eaglets, looking at the\nchild-larks with hungry eyes.\n\n\"Because I forbid you. They are my guests, and must be protected and\nwell treated. And even if this were not so, the larks are too small to\nsatisfy your hunger, you little gluttons.\"\n\n\"Jonathan,\" said Mrs. Eagle, coldly, \"do not reproach our offspring for\ntheir hunger. We sent you out this morning to procure a supply of food,\nand we expected you to bring us home something good to eat, instead of\nthese useless little creatures.\"\n\nThe eagle seemed annoyed at being scolded in this manner.\n\n\"I had an adventure in the forest,\" he said, \"and came near being shot\nand killed by a man. That is the reason I came home so soon.\"\n\nTwinkle and Chubbins were standing together at the edge of the crag\nwhen one of the eaglets suddenly spread out his wide, stiff wings and\npushed them over the precipice. They recovered themselves before they\nhad fallen far, and flew to the ledge again just in time to see the\nfather eagle cuff his naughty son very soundly. But the mother only\nlaughed in her harsh voice and said:\n\n\"It is so early in the day, Jonathan, that I advise you to go again in\nsearch of food. Our sweet darlings will not be comforted until they\nhave eaten.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" answered the eagle. \"I am sorry you cannot treat my guests\nmore politely, for they are all unaccustomed to such rudeness. But I\nsee that it will be better for me to take them away with me at once.\"\n\n\"Do,\" said Mrs. Eagle; and the eaglets cried: \"Better let us eat 'em,\ndaddy. They are not very big, but they're better than no breakfast at\nall.\"\n\n\"You're dis'greeable things!\" said Twinkle, indignantly; \"and I don't\nlike you a bit. So _there!\"_\n\n\"Come on, Twink,\" said Chubbins. \"Let's go away.\"\n\n\"I will take you back to the forest,\" the eagle declared, and at once\nrose into the air. Twinkle and Chubbins followed him, and soon the nest\non the crag was left far behind and they could no longer hear the hoot\nof the savage young ones.\n\nFor a time the eagle flew in silence. Then he said:\n\n\"You must forgive my family for not being more hospitable. You must\nknow that they live a very lonely life, and have no society because\nevery living thing fears them. But I go abroad more and see more of the\nworld, so I know very well how guests ought to be treated.\"\n\n\"You have been very kind to us, Mr. Eagle,\" replied the girl-lark, \"and\nyou saved my life when the dog would have killed me. I don't blame you\nany for what your family did. My mama says lots of people show off\nbetter abroad than they do at home, and that's your case exactly. If I\nwere you I wouldn't take any more visitors to my nest.\"\n\n\"I do not intend to,\" answered the eagle. \"But I am glad that you think\nwell of me personally, if you do not of my family, and I assure you it\nhas been a real pleasure to me to assist you. Were you like ordinary\nbirds, you would be beneath my notice; but I am wise enough to\nunderstand that you are very unusual and wonderful little creatures,\nand if at any time I can serve you further, you have but to call me,\nand I will do what I can for you.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" replied Twinkle, who realized that the great\nbird had acted more gently toward them than it is the nature of his\nwild race to do.\n\nThey had just reached the edge of the forest again when they saw a bird\napproaching them at a great speed, and soon it came near enough for\nthem to see that it was Policeman Bluejay. He wore his official helmet\nand carried his club, and as soon as he came beside them he said:\n\n\"Thank goodness I've found you at last. I've been hunting for you an\nhour, and began to fear you had met with some misfortune.\"\n\n\"We've been with the eagle,\" said the girl. \"He saved our lives and\ncarried us away from where the dreadful men were.\"\n\n\"We have had sad doings in the forest today--very sad, indeed,\"\ndeclared the bluejay, in a grave voice. \"The hunters did even more\ndamage than usual. They killed Jolly Joe, the brown bear, and Sam Fox,\nand Mrs. 'Possum and her babies, and Wisk the squirrel; so that the\nanimals are all in mourning for their friends. But our birds suffered\ngreatly, also. Mrs. Hootaway is dead, and three pigeons belonging to a\nhighly respected family; but the saddest of all is the murder of Mr.\nand Mrs. Goldfinch, both of whom were killed by the same shot. You may\nremember, my dears, that they were at your reception yesterday, and as\ngay and happy as any of the company present. In their nest are now five\nlittle children, too young and weak to fly, and there is no one to feed\nthem or look after them.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is dreadful!\" exclaimed Twinkle. \"Can't Chubbins and I do\nsomething for the little goldfinches?\"\n\n\"Why, that is why I was so anxious to find you,\" answered Policeman\nBluejay. \"You haven't laid any eggs yet, and have no one to depend upon\nyou. So I hoped you would adopt the goldfinch babies.\"\n\n\"We will,\" said Chubbins, promptly. \"We can feed them out of our\nbasket.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" chimed in the girl. \"We couldn't catch grubs for them, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"It won't be necessary,\" observed the policeman, with a sly wink at the\neagle. \"They're too young yet to know grubs from grub.\"\n\n\n\n[CHAPTER XI] _The Orphans_\n\nThe eagle now bade them good-bye and flew away in search of prey, while\nthe bluejay and the child-larks directed their flight toward that part\nof the great forest where they lived.\n\n\"Are you sure the men have gone?\" asked Chubbins.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the policeman; \"they left the forest as soon as they had\nshot Jolly Joe, for the brown bear was so heavy that they had to carry\nhim on a pole resting across their shoulders. I hope they won't come\nagain very soon.\"\n\n\"Did they take Mrs. Hootaway with them?\" asked Twinkle.\n\n\"Yes; she will probably be stuffed, poor thing!\"\n\nPresently they passed near the rosy glow that lighted up the center of\nthe forest with its soft radiance, and the girl said:\n\n\"That is the Paradise Land, where the Birds of Paradise live. The eagle\nhas promised to ask one of those birds to let us visit their country.\"\n\n\"Oh, I can do better than that, if you wish to visit the Paradise,\"\nresponded the bluejay; \"for the Guardian of the Entrance is a special\nfriend of mine, and will do whatever I ask him to.\"\n\n\"Will he, really?\" asked the girl, in delight.\n\n\"To be sure. Some day I will take you over there, and then you will see\nwhat powerful friends Policeman Bluejay has.\"\n\n\"I'd like that,\" declared Twinkle.\n\nTheir swift flight enabled them to cover the remaining distance very\nrapidly, and soon they were at home again.\n\nThey first flew to the nest of the goldfinches, which was in a tree not\nfar from the maple where the lark-children lived. There they found the\ntiny birds, who were yet so new that they were helpless indeed. Mrs.\nRedbreast was sitting by the nest when they arrived, and she said:\n\n\"The poor orphans are still hungry, although I have fed them all the\ninsects I could find near. But I am glad that you have come, for it is\ntime I was at home looking after my own little ones.\"\n\n\"Chubbins and I have 'dopted the goldfinches,\" said Twinkle, \"so we will\nlook after them now. But it was very nice of you, Mrs. Redbreast, to\ntake take care of them until we arrived.\"\n\n\"Well, I like to be neighborly,\" returned the pretty bird; \"and as long\nas cruel men enter our forest no mother can tell how soon her own\nlittle ones will be orphaned and left helpless.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said the policeman, nodding gravely.\n\nSo Mrs. Redbreast flew away and now Chubbins looked curiously into the\nnest, where several fluffy heads were eagerly lifted with their bills\nas wide open as they could possibly stretch.\n\n\"They must be just _awful_ hungry, Twink,\" said the boy.\n\n\"Oh, they're always like that,\" observed Policeman Bluejay, calmly.\n\"When anyone is around they open their mouths to be fed, whether they\nare hungry or not. It's the way with birdlets.\"\n\n\"What shall we feed them?\" asked Twinkle.\n\n\"Oh, anything at all; they are not particular,\" said the bluejay, and\nthen he flew away and left the child-larks to their new and interesting\ntask.\n\n\"I'll be the father, and you be the mother,\" said Chubbins.\n\n\"All right,\" answered Twinkle.\n\n\"Peep! peep! peep!\" said the tiny goldfinches.\n\n\"I wonder if the luncheon in our basket would agree with them,\"\nremarked the girl, looking at the open mouths reflectively as she\nperched her own brown body upon the edge of the deep nest.\n\n\"Might try it,\" suggested the boy. \"The cop says they're not\nparticular, and what's good enough for us ought to be good enough for\nthem.\"\n\nSo they flew to where the basket hung among the thick leaves of the\ntree, which had served to prevent the men from discovering it, and\ncrept underneath the cloth that covered it.\n\n\"Which do you think they'd like best,\" asked Chubbins, \"the pickles or\nthe cheese?\"\n\n\"Neither one,\" Twinkle replied. \"The sandwiches will be best for them.\nWait; I'll pick out some of the meat that is between the slices of\nbread. They'll be sure to like that.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" agreed Chubbins, promptly. \"They'll think it's bugs.\"\n\nSo each one dragged out a big piece of meat from a sandwich, and by\nholding it fast in one claw they managed to fly with the burden to the\nnest of the goldfinch babies.\n\n\"Don't give it to 'em all at once,\" cautioned the girl. \"It would choke\n'em.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Chubbins.\n\nHe tore off a tiny bit of the meat and dropped it into one of the\nwide-open bills. Instantly it was gone and the mouth was open again for\nmore. They tried to divide the dinner equally among them, but they all\nlooked so alike and were so ravenous to eat everything that was dropped\ninto their bills that it was hard work to keep track of which had been\nfed and which had not. But the child-larks were positive that each one\nhad had enough to keep it from starving, because there was a big bunch\nin front of each little breast that was a certain proof of a full crop.\n\nThe next task of the guardians was to give the birdlets drink; so\nTwinkle and Chubbins flew to the brook and by hunting around a while\nthey found an acorn-cup that had fallen from one of the oak trees. This\nthey filled with water, and then Twinkle, who was a trifle larger than\nthe boy-lark, clutched the cup firmly with her toes and flew back to\nthe orphans without spilling more than a few drops. They managed to\npour some of the water into each open mouth, and then Twinkle said:\n\n\"There! they won't die of either hunger or thirst in a hurry, Chub. So\nnow we can feed ourselves.\"\n\n\"Their mouths are still open,\" returned the boy, doubtfully.\n\n\"It must be a habit they have,\" she answered. \"Wouldn't you think\nthey'd get tired stretching their bills that way?\"\n\n\"Peep! peep! peep!\" cried the baby goldfinches.\n\n\"You see,\" said the boy, with a wise look, \"they don't know any better.\nI had a dog once that howled every time we shut him up. But if we let\nhim alone he stopped howling. We'll go and get something to eat and let\nthese beggars alone a while. Perhaps they'll shut their mouths by the\ntime we get back again.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" replied Twinkle.\n\nThey got their own luncheon from the basket, and afterward perched on\nthe tree near the nest of the little goldfinches. They did not feel at\nall comfortable in their old nest in the maple, because they could not\nforget the tragic deaths of the inhabitants of the three hollows in the\ntree--the three \"flats\" as poor Wisk had merrily called them.\n\nDuring the afternoon several of the birds came to call upon the\norphans, and they all nodded approval when they found the child-larks\nwatching over the little ones. Twinkle questioned some of the mothers\nanxiously about that trick the babies had of keeping their bills open\nand crying for food, but she was told to pay no attention to such\nactions.\n\nNevertheless, the pleadings of the orphans, who were really stuffed\nfull of food, made the child-larks so nervous that they hailed with\ndelight the arrival of Policeman Bluejay in the early evening. The busy\nofficer had brought with him Mrs. Chaffinch, a widow whose husband had\nbeen killed a few days before by a savage wildcat.\n\nMrs. Chaffinch declared she would be delighted to become a mother to\nthe little goldfinches, and rear them properly. She had always had good\nsuccess in bringing up her own children, she claimed, and the\ngoldfinches were first cousins to the chaffinches, so she was sure to\nunderstand their ways perfectly.\n\nTwinkle did not want to give up her charges at first, as she had become\ninterested in them; but Chubbins heaved a sigh of relief and declared\nhe was glad the \"restless little beggars\" had a mother that knew more\nabout them than he did. The bluejay hinted that he considered the\nwidow's experience would enable her to do more for the baby goldfinches\nthan could a child-lark who had never yet laid an egg, and so Twinkle\nwas forced to yield to his superior judgment.\n\nMrs. Chaffinch settled herself in a motherly manner upon the nest, and\nthe two bird-children bade her good-night and returned to their own\nmaple tree, where they had a rather wakeful night, because Chubbins\nthoughtlessly suggested that the place might be haunted by the ghosts\nof the gray owl, Wisk, and Mrs. 'Possum.\n\nBut either the poor things had no ghosts or they were too polite to\nbother the little child-larks.\n\n\n\n[CHAPTER XII] _The Guardian_\n\nThe next morning ushered in a glorious day, sunny and bright. The sky\nwas a clear blue, and only a slight breeze ruffled the leaves of the\ntrees. Even before Twinkle and Chubbins were awake the birds were\ncalling merrily to one another throughout the forest, and the chipmonks\nchirped in their own brisk, businesslike way as they scuttled from tree\nto tree.\n\nWhile the child-larks were finishing their breakfast Policeman Bluejay\ncame to them, his feathers looking fresh and glossy and all his\ngorgeous colorings appearing especially beautiful in the sunshine.\n\n\"Today will be a rare day to visit the Paradise,\" he said; \"so I have\ncome to escort you to the Guardian of the Entrance, who I am sure will\narrange for you to enter that wonderful country.\"\n\n\"It is very kind of you to remember our wish,\" said Twinkle. \"We are\nall ready.\"\n\nSo they flew above the tree-tops and began their journey toward the\ncenter of the forest.\n\n\"Where's your p'liceman's hat and club?\" Chubbins asked the bluejay.\n\n\"Why, I left them at home,\" was the reply. \"I'm not on official duty\ntoday, you know, and the Guardian does not like to see anything that\nlooks like a weapon. In his country there are no such things as\nquarrels or fighting, or naughtiness of any sort; for as they have\neverything they want there is nothing to quarrel over or fight for. The\nBirds of Paradise have laws, I understand; but they obey them because\nthey are told to, and not because they are forced to. It would be a bad\ncountry for a policeman to live in.\"\n\n\"But a good place for everyone else,\" said Twinkle.\n\n\"Perhaps so,\" agreed the policeman, reluctantly. \"But I sometimes think\nthe goody-goody places would get awful tiresome to live in, after a\ntime. Here in our part of the forest there is a little excitement, for\nthe biggest birds only obey our laws through fear of punishment, and I\nunderstand it is just the same in the world of men. But in the Birds'\nParadise there lives but one race, every member of which is quite\nparticular not to annoy any of his fellows in any way. That is why they\nwill admit no disturbing element into their country. If you are\nadmitted, my dears, you must be very careful not to offend any one that\nyou meet.\"\n\n\"We'll try to be good,\" promised Chubbins.\n\n\"I would not dare to take any of my own people there,\" continued the\nbluejay, flying swiftly along as they talked together; \"but you two are\ndifferent, and more like the fairy Birds of Paradise themselves than\nlike our forest birds. That is the reason I feel sure the Guardian will\nadmit you.\"\n\n\"I'm naughty sometimes, and so is Chubbins,\" said Twinkle, honestly.\n\"But we try not to be any naughtier than we can help.\"\n\n\"I am sure you will behave very nicely,\" replied the bluejay.\n\nAfter a time the rosy glow appeared reflected in the blue sky, and as\nthey flew toward it the soft and delightful radiance seemed to grow and\ndeepen in intensity. It did not dazzle their eyes in the least, but as\nthe light penetrated the forest and its furthest rays fell upon the\ngroup, they experienced a queer sense of elation and light-hearted joy.\n\nBut now the breeze freshened and grew more strong, pressing against\ntheir feathered breasts so gently yet powerfully that they soon\ndiscovered they were not advancing at all, but simply fluttering in the\nair.\n\n\"Drop down to the ground,\" whispered the bluejay; and they obeyed his\ninjunction and found that close to the earth the wind was not so\nstrong.\n\n\"That is a secret I learned some time ago,\" said their friend. \"Most\nbirds who seek to enter the Paradise try to beat against the wind, and\nare therefore always driven back; but there is just one way to approach\nthe Guardian near enough to converse with him. After that it depends\nentirely upon his good-will whether you get any farther.\"\n\nThe wind still blew so strongly that it nearly took their breath away,\nbut by creeping steadily over the ground they were able to proceed\nslowly, and after a time the pressure of the wind grew less and less,\nuntil it suddenly ceased altogether.\n\nThen they stopped to rest and to catch their breaths, but before this\nhappened Twinkle and Chubbins both uttered exclamations of amazement at\nthe sight that met their eyes.\n\nBefore them was a grove composed of stately trees not made of wood, but\nhaving trunks of polished gold and silver and leaves of exquisite\nmetallic colorings. Beneath the trees was a mass of brilliant flowers,\nexceedingly rare and curious in form, and as our little friends looked\nupon them these flowers suddenly began a chant of greeting and then\nsang a song so sweet and musical that the lark-children were entranced\nand listened in rapt delight.\n\nWhen the song ended the flowers all nodded their heads in a pretty way,\nand Twinkle drew a long breath and murmured:\n\n\"Isn't it odd to hear flowers sing? I'm sure the birds themselves\ncannot beat that music.\"\n\n\"They won't try,\" replied the policeman, \"for Birds of Paradise do not\nsing.\"\n\n\"How strange!\" exclaimed the girl.\n\n\"The land they live in is so full of music that they do not need to,\"\ncontinued the bluejay. \"But before us is the entrance, leading through\nthe limbs of that great golden tree you see at the left. Fly swiftly\nwith me, and perch upon the middle branch.\"\n\nWith these words he darted toward the tree, and Twinkle and Chubbins\nfollowed. In a few seconds they alighted upon the branch and found\nthemselves face to face with the first Bird of Paradise they had yet\nseen.\n\nHe possessed a graceful carriage and a most attractive form, being in\nsize about as large as a common pigeon. His eyes were shrewd but gentle\nin expression and his pose as he stood regarding the newcomers was\ndignified and impressive. But the children had little time to note\nthese things because their wondering eyes were riveted upon the bird's\nmagnificent plumage. The feathers lay so smoothly against his body that\nthey seemed to present a solid surface, and in color they were a\nglistening emerald green upon the neck and wings, shading down on the\nbreast to a softer green and then to a pure white. The main\nwing-feathers were white, tipped with vivid scarlet, and the white\nfeathers of his crest were also tipped with specks of flame. But his\ntail feathers were the most beautiful of all his gay uniform. They\nspread out in the shape of a fan, and every other feather was brilliant\ngreen and its alternate feather snow white.\n\n\"How lovely!\" cried Twinkle, and the bird bowed its head and with a\nmerry glance from its eyes responded:\n\n\"Your admiration highly honors me, little stranger.\"\n\n\"This,\" said Policeman Bluejay, \"is the important official called the\nGuardian of the Entrance of Paradise. Sir Guardian, permit me to\nintroduce to you two children of men who have been magically\ntransformed into skylarks against their will. They are not quite birds,\nbecause their heads retain the human shape; but whatever form they may\nbear, their natures are sweet and innocent and I deem them worthy to\nassociate for a brief time with your splendid and regal race. Therefore\nI have brought them here to commend them to your hospitality and\ngood-will, and I hope you will receive them as your guests.\"\n\n\"What are your names, little strangers?\" asked the Guardian.\n\n\"Mama calls me Twinkle,\" said the girl.\n\n\"I'm Chubbins,\" said the boy.\n\nThe Guardian looked attentively at the bluejay.\n\n\"You know our regulations,\" said he; \"no birds of the forest are\nadmitted to our Paradise.\"\n\n\"I know,\" replied the policeman. \"I will await my little friends here.\nIt is pleasure enough for me to have just this glimpse of your\nbeautiful fairyland.\"\n\nThe Guardian nodded his approval of this speech.\n\n\"Very well,\" he answered, \"you shall remain and visit with me. If all\nforest birds were like you, my friend, there would be little danger in\nadmitting them into our society. But they are not, and the laws must be\nregarded. As for the child-larks, I will send them first to the King,\nin charge of the Royal Messenger, whom I will now summon.\"\n\nHe tossed his head upward with an abrupt motion, and in the tree-top a\nchime of golden bells rang musically in the air. The flowers beneath\nthem caught up the refrain, and sang it softly until another bird came\ndarting through the air and alighted on the golden limb beside the\nGuardian.\n\nThe newcomer was differently garbed from the other. His plumage was\norange and white, the crest and wing-feathers being tipped with bright\nblue. Nor was he so large as the Guardian, nor so dignified in\ndemeanor. Indeed, his expression was rather merry and roguish, and as\nhe saw the strangers he gave a short, sharp whistle of surprise.\n\n\"My dear Ephel,\" said the Guardian, \"oblige me by escorting these\nchild-larks to the presence of his Majesty the King.\"\n\n\"I am delighted to obey your request,\" answered Ephel the Messenger,\nbrightly. Then, turning to Twinkle and Chubbins, he added: \"I trust you\nwill find my society agreeable during our flight to the royal monarch\nof Paradise.\"\n\nTwinkle was too much embarrassed by this politeness to answer at once,\nbut Chubbins said \"Sure thing!\" in a matter-of-fact voice, and the\nMessenger nodded gaily and continued:\n\n\"Then we will go, if it pleases you.\"\n\nHe spread his wings in a flash of color and sped away into the\nParadise, and the children eagerly followed him.\n\n\n\n[CHAPTER XIII] _The King Bird_\n\nMore and more magnificence was unfolded as they advanced into this\nveritable fairyland of the birds. Vines of silver climbed up the golden\ntrunks of trees and mingled their twining threads with the brilliant\nleaves. And now upon the trees appeared jewelled blossoms that sparkled\nmost exquisitely in the rosy-hued radiance that, in this favored spot,\nhad taken the place of sunshine. There were beds of plants with\nwide-spreading leaves that changed color constantly, one hue slowly\nmelting into another and no two leaves on the same plant having the\nsame color at the same time. Yet in spite of the vivid coloring that\nprevailed everywhere, each combination seemed in perfect harmony and\nserved to delight the senses.\n\nBushes that emitted a grateful fragrance bore upon slender branches\nlittle bells that at times tinkled in the perfumed breeze and played\nsweet melodies, while here and there were clusters of fountain-lilies\nthat shot sprays of crystal water high into the air. When the water\nfell back again and the drops struck against the broad leaves of the\nplants, they produced a melodious sound that was so delightful that\nTwinkle thought she could listen to it for hours.\n\nTheir guide flew silently on, and the two children were so much amazed\nby their surroundings that they had no words for questions or even\nremarks.\n\nThe scene was ever shifting and becoming more and more lovely and\nfascinating, and the paradise was more extensive than they had thought\nit.\n\nBy and bye Ephel the Messenger approached the central part, where was a\ngreat arbor thickly covered with masses of pure white flowers. Some of\nthese were large, like chrysanthemums and mammoth white double roses,\nwhile among them were twined smaller and more delicate blossoms, like\nthe bells of lilies-of-the-valley.\n\nEphel entered the arch of the arbor and flew on, for it was of great\nextent and continually enlarged from the point of entrance, so that at\nlast the child-larks found themselves in a lofty circular chamber\nbanked on sides and roof with solid masses of the snow-white flowers,\nwhich filled the air with a sweet and agreeable perfume. The floor was\nalso a mass of white blossoms, so that the place resembled the inside\nof a huge cornucopia.\n\nBut the eyes of the little strangers were not directed so much to the\narbor itself as to the group of splendid birds that occupied the\nflower-chamber and perched upon a wide-spreading bush of filigree gold\nthat rose from the middle of the floor and spread its dainty branches\nin every direction.\n\nOn the lower branches sat many birds of marvellous colorings, some\nhaving blue the predominant tint in their feathers, and others green,\nor scarlet, or brilliant yellows. In strong contrast with these were a\nfew modest-looking birds with soft brown feathers covering their\ngraceful forms, that sat silently upon the lowest and most retired\nbranch of the golden bush; but still greater was the contrast of all\npresent with the magnificence of the one occupying the topmost branch.\n\nThis gorgeous creature, whose splendor dominated the white bower, at\nonce won the children's attention, and they had no doubt they were\ngazing upon the King Bird of Paradise.\n\nThe feathers of his head and neck were so fine that they looked like a\ncovering of velvet. These seemed to be, at first, of a delicate\nlavender color, but the children observed that they shone with a\ndifferent tint at every movement the King made. The body feathers, also\nas glossy as velvet, were of a rich royal purple, shading to lavender\nand then to white upon his breast. His wing plumes were white, tipped\nwith specks of lustrous gold.\n\nBut by far the most astonishing part of the King's plumage was that\nwhich consisted of the dainty, fern-like plumes that rose from his body\nand tail and spread in graceful and bewildering curves both right and\nleft, until his form seemed to be standing in a feathery bower of\nresplendent beauty. All the colors of the rainbow were seen in these\ndelicate feathers, and against the white background of the arch this\nmonarch of the feathered world appeared more royally magnificent than\nany words can describe.\n\nBoth Twinkle and Chubbins gasped with amazement and delight as, at the\ncommand of Ephel, they alighted upon a lowly branch of the golden bush\nand bowed their heads before the ruler of the birds' fairyland.\n\n\"Ah, whom have we here?\" asked the King, in a soft voice, as he\nstrutted and proudly turned himself upon his perch.\n\n\"Strangers, your Majesty,\" answered the Messenger. \"They are sent to\nyou by the Guardian of the Entrance because they are gentle and\ninnocent, and are neither birds nor mortals, but a part of both.\"\n\n\"They are certainly very curious,\" remarked the King, staring at the\nhuman heads upon the lark bodies. \"May I ask you, little strangers, how\nyou happen to exist in your present form?\"\n\nTwinkle, tossing her head to throw back a straggling lock of hair that\nhad fallen across her eyes, began in her sweet voice to tell the story\nof their enchantment, and not only the King but all the Birds of\nParadise present listened intently to her words.\n\nWhen she had finished the King exclaimed:\n\n\"Indeed, my dear child-larks, you are worthy to be our guests in\nfairyland. So it will please me if you will be as happy and comfortable\nas possible, and enjoy your stay with us as much as you can. My people\nwill delight to honor and amuse you, and Ephel shall continue to guide\nyou wherever you go.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" returned Twinkle, earnestly; and Chubbins added, in his\nblunt way: \"Much obliged.\"\n\n\"But, before you go,\" continued his Majesty, \"tell me what you think of\nmy royal person. Am I not beautiful?\"\n\n\"You are, indeed,\" replied Twinkle; \"only--\"\n\n\"Only what?\" asked the King, as she hesitated.\n\n\"Only I'm sorry you are so vain, and strut around so, and want everyone\nto see how beautiful you are.\"\n\n\"Why should I not? Is not vanity one of the great virtues?\" asked the\nKing, in a surprised voice.\n\n\"My mama says people ought not to think themselves nice, or pretty,\"\nsaid the child. \"With us, to be vain is a fault, and we are taught to\nbe modest and unassuming.\"\n\n\"How remarkable!\" exclaimed the King. \"And how very thoughtless your\nmother must be. Here we think that if God creates us beautiful it is a\nsin not to glory in His work, and make everyone acknowledge the kindly\nskill of the Supreme Maker's hand. Should I try to make others think,\nor should I myself think, that I am not most gracefully formed and most\ngorgeously clothed, I would be guilty of the sin of not appreciating\nthe favor of God, and deserve to be punished.\"\n\nTwinkle was amazed, but could find no words to contradict this\nastonishing idea.\n\n\"I had not thought of it in that way,\" she answered. \"Perhaps I am\nwrong, your Majesty; and certainly you are very beautiful.\"\n\n\"Think it over,\" said the King, graciously. \"Learn to be grateful for\nevery good thing that is yours, and proud that you have been selected\nby Nature for adornment. Only in this way may such rare favors be\ndeserved. And now the royal Messenger will show you the sights of our\nParadise, and try to entertain you pleasantly while you are our\nguests.\"\n\nHe turned aside, with these words, and fluttered his waving feathers so\nthat their changing tints might dazzle the eyes of all observers. But\nimmediately afterward he paused and cried out:\n\n\"Dear me! One of my wing plumes is disarranged. Help me, you ladies!\"\n\nAt once the small brown birds on the lower branches, who had been\nmodestly quiet because they had no gay plumage, flew up to the King and\nwith their bills skillfully dressed his feathers, putting the wing\nplume into its place again and arranging it properly, while the other\nbirds looked on with evident interest.\n\nAs the lark-children turned away to follow the Messenger Chubbins\nremarked:\n\n\"I'm glad _I_ haven't got all those giddy feathers.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Twinkle, who had been rather awed by the King's splendor.\n\n\"Because it would take all my time to keep 'em smooth,\" answered the\nboy. \"The poor King can't do much more than admire himself, so he don't\nget time to have fun.\"\n\n\n\n[CHAPTER XIV] _A Real Fairyland_\n\nAs they left the royal arbor of white flowers the Messenger turned to\nthe left and guided his guests through several bright and charming\navenues to a grove of trees that had bright blue bark and yellow\nleaves. Scattered about among the branches were blossoms of a delicate\npink color, shaped like a cup and resembling somewhat the flower of the\nmorning-glory.\n\n\"Are you hungry?\" asked Ephel.\n\n\"Oh, I could eat something, I guess,\" said Chubbins.\n\nThe Messenger flew to one of the trees and alighted upon a branch where\nthree of the pink, cup-shaped flowers grew in a row. The children\nfollowed him, and sitting one before each blossom they looked within\nthe cups and found them filled with an unknown substance that both\nlooked and smelled delicious and appetizing.\n\n\"It is royal amal,\" said their guide, busily pecking at his cup with\nhis bill. \"Help yourselves, little ones. You will find it very nice\nindeed.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Twinkle, \"I'd be glad to eat it if I could. But it\nwouldn't do Chubbins and me a bit of good to stick our noses into these\ncups.\"\n\nEphel turned to look at them.\n\n\"True,\" he remarked; \"it was very careless of me to forget that you\nhave no bills. How are you accustomed to eat?\"\n\n\"Why, with spoons, and knives and forks,\" said the girl.\n\n\"You have but to ask for what you need,\" declared the royal Messenger.\n\nTwinkle hesitated, scarcely knowing what to say. At last she spoke\nboldly: \"I wish Chub and I had spoons.\"\n\nHardly had the words left her lips when two tiny golden spoons appeared\nin the flower-cups. Twinkle seized the spoon before her in one claw and\ndipped up a portion of the strange food, which resembled charlotte\nrusse in appearance. When she tasted it she found it delicious; so she\neagerly ate all that the blossom contained.\n\nWhen she looked around for Chubbins she found he was gone. He had\nemptied his cup and carried the golden spoon to another blossom on a\nhigher limb, where the girl discovered him eating as fast as he could\ndip up the food.\n\n\"Let us go to another tree,\" said Ephel. \"There are many excellent\nthings to eat, and a variety of food is much more agreeable than\nfeasting upon one kind.\"\n\n\"All right,\" called Chubbins, who had succeeded in emptying the second\ncup.\n\nAs they flew on Twinkle said to the guide:\n\n\"I should think the blossoms would all be emptied in a little while.\"\n\n\"Oh, they fill up again in a few moments,\" replied Ephel. \"Should we go\nback even now, I think we would find them all ready to eat again. But\nhere are the conona bushes. Let us taste these favorite morsels.\"\n\nThe bushes on which they now rested had willow-green branches with\nsilver balls growing thickly upon them. Ephel tapped lightly upon one\nof the balls with his bill and at once it opened by means of a hinge in\nthe center, the two halves of the ball lying flat, like plates. On one\nside Twinkle found tiny round pellets of cake, each one just big enough\nto make a mouthful for a bird. On the other side was a thick substance\nthat looked like jelly.\n\n\"The proper thing to do,\" said their guide, \"is to roll one of the\npellets in the jelly, and then eat it.\"\n\nHe showed Twinkle how to do this, and as she had brought her golden\nspoon with her it was easy enough. Ephel opened a ball for Chubbins and\nthen one for himself, and the children thought this food even nicer\nthan the first they had eaten.\n\n\"Now we will have some fruit,\" declared the Messenger. He escorted his\ncharges to an orchard where grew many strange and beautiful trees\nhanging full of fruits that were all unknown to the lark-children. They\nwere of many odd shapes and all superbly colored, some gleaming like\nsilver and gold and others being cherry-red or vivid blue or royal\npurple in shade. A few resembled grapes and peaches and cherries; but\nthey had flavors not only varied and delicious but altogether different\nfrom the fruits that grow outside of the Birds' Paradise.\n\nAnother queer thing was, that as fast as the children ate one fruit,\nanother appeared in its place, and they hopped from branch to branch\nand tree to tree, trying this one and that, until Chubbins exclaimed:\n\n\"Really, Twink, I can't eat another mouthful.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid we've both been stuffing ourselves, Chub,\" the girl\nreplied. \"But these things taste so good it is hard to stop at the\nright time.\"\n\n\"Would you like to drink?\" asked Ephel.\n\n\"If you please,\" Twinkle answered.\n\n\"Then follow me,\" said the guide.\n\nHe led them through lovely vistas of wonderful trees, down beautiful\nwinding avenues that excited their admiration, and past clusters of\nflowering plants with leaves as big as umbrellas and as bright as a\npainter's palette. The Paradise seemed to have been laid out according\nto one exquisite, symmetrical plan, and although the avenues or paths\nbetween the trees and plants led in every direction, the ground beneath\nthem was everywhere thickly covered with a carpet of magnificent\nflowers or richly tinted ferns and grasses. This was because the birds\nnever walked upon the ground, but always flew through the air.\n\nOften, as they passed by, the flowers would greet them with sweet songs\nor choruses and the plants would play delightful music by rubbing or\nstriking their leaves against one another, so that the children's ears\nwere constantly filled with harmony, while their eyes were feasted on\nthe bewildering masses of rich color, and each breath they drew was\nfragrant with the delicious odors of the blossoms that abounded on\nevery side.\n\n\"Of all the fairylands I've ever heard of or read about,\" said Twinkle,\n\"this certainly is the best.\"\n\n\"It's just a peach of a fairyland,\" commented Chubbins, approvingly.\n\n\"Here is the nectar tree,\" presently remarked the royal Messenger, and\nhe paused to allow them to observe it.\n\nThe tree was all of silver--silver trunk and branches and leaves--and\nfrom the end of each leaf or branch dripped sparkling drops of a\npink-tinted liquid. These glistened brightly as they fell through the\nair and lost themselves in a bed of silver moss that covered all the\nground beneath the tree.\n\nEphel flew to a branch and held his mouth open so that a drop from\nabove fell into it. Twinkle and Chubbins followed his example, and\nfound the pink liquid very delightful to drink. It seemed to quench\ntheir thirst and refresh them at the same time, and when they flew from\nthe queer dripping tree they were as light-hearted and gay as any two\nchildren so highly favored could possibly have felt.\n\n\"Haven't you any water in your paradise?\" asked the little girl-lark.\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" Ephel answered. \"The fountain-lilies supply what\nwater we wish to drink, and the Lustrous Lake is large enough for us\nall to bathe in. Besides these, we have also the Lake of Dry Water, for\nyou must know that the Lustrous Lake is composed of wet water.\"\n\n\"I thought all water was wet,\" said Chubbins.\n\n\"It may be so in your country,\" replied the Royal Messenger, \"but in\nour Paradise we have both dry and wet water. Would you like to visit\nthese lakes?\"\n\n\"If you please,\" said Twinkle.\n\n\n\n[CHAPTER XV] _The Lake of Dry Water_\n\nThey flew through the jewelled gardens for quite a way, emerging at\nlast from among the trees to find before them a pretty sheet of water\nof a greenish hue. Upon the shore were rushes that when swayed by the\nbreeze sang soft strains of music.\n\n\"This,\" announced their guide, \"is the Lake of Dry Water.\"\n\n\"It _looks_ wet, all right,\" said Chubbins, in a tone of doubt.\n\n\"But it isn't,\" declared Ephel. \"Watch me, if you please.\"\n\nHe hovered over the lake a moment and then dove downward and\ndisappeared beneath the surface. When he came up again he shook the\ndrops of water from his plumage and then flew back to rejoin his\nguests.\n\n\"Look at me,\" he said. \"My feathers are not even damp.\" They looked,\nand saw that he spoke truly. Then Chubbins decided to try a bath in the\ndry water, and also plunged into the lake. When he came to the surface\nhe floated there for a time, and ducked his head again and again; but\nwhen he came back to the others not a hair of his head nor a feather of\nhis little brown body was in the least moist.\n\n\"That's fine water,\" said the boy-lark. \"I suppose you Birds of\nParadise bathe here all the time.\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Ephel; \"for only wet water is cleansing and refreshing.\nWe always take our daily baths in the Lustrous Lake. But here we\nusually sail and disport ourselves, for it is a comfort not to get wet\nwhen you want to play in the water.\"\n\n\"How do you sail?\" asked Twinkle, with interest.\n\n\"I will show you,\" replied their guide.\n\nHe flew to a tall tree near, that had broad, curling leaves, and\nplucked a leaf with his bill. The breeze caught it at once and wafted\nit to the lake, so that it fell gently upon the water.\n\n\"Get aboard, please,\" called Ephel, and alighted upon the broad surface\nof the floating leaf. Twinkle and Chubbins followed, one sitting in\nfront of their guide and one behind him. Then Ephel spread out his\nwings of white and orange, and the breeze pushed gently against them\nand sent the queer boat gliding over the surface of the dry water.\n\n\"Sometimes, when the wind is strong,\" said the Royal Messenger, \"these\nfrail craft upset, and then we are dumped into the water. But we never\nmind that, because the water is dry and we are not obliged to dress our\nfeathers again.\"\n\n\"It is very convenient,\" observed Twinkle, who was enjoying the sail.\n\"Could one be drowned in this lake?\"\n\n\"I suppose an animal, like man, could, for it is as impossible to\nbreathe beneath dry water as it is beneath wet. But only birds live\nhere, and they cannot drown, because as soon as they come to the\nsurface they fly into the air.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Twinkle, musingly.\n\nThey sailed way across the lake, and because the wind was gentle they\ndid not upset once. On reaching the farther shore they abandoned the\nleaf-boat and again took wing and resumed their flight through the\navenues.\n\nThere was a great variety of scenery in the Paradise, and wherever they\nwent something new and different was sure to meet their view.\n\nAt one place the avenue was carpeted with big pansies of every color\none could imagine, some of them, indeed, having several colors blended\ntogether upon their petals. As they passed over the pansies Twinkle\nheard a chorus of joyous laughter, and looking downward, she perceived\nthat the pansies all had faces, and the faces resembled those of happy\nchildren.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" she cried to Chubbins and the guide, and then she flew\ndownward until she could see the faces more plainly. They smiled and\nnodded to the girl-lark, and laughed their merry laughter; but when she\nspoke to them Twinkle found they were unable to answer a single word.\n\nMany of the faces were exceedingly beautiful; but others were bold and\nsaucy, and a few looked at her with eyes twinkling with mischief. They\nseemed very gay and contented in their paradise, so Twinkle merely\nkissed one lovely face that smiled upon her and then flew away to rejoin\nher companions.\n\n\n\n[CHAPTER XVI] _The Beauty Dance_\n\nBefore long they came to another and larger sheet of water, and this\nTwinkle decided was the most beautiful lake she had ever seen. Its\nwaters were mostly deep blue in color, although they had a changeable\neffect and constantly shifted from one hue to another. Little waves\nrippled all over its surface, and the edges of the waves were\nglistening jewels which, as they scattered in spray and fell into the\nbosom of the lake, glinted and sparkled with a thousand flashing\nlights. Here were no rushes upon the shore, but instead of them banks\nof gorgeous flowers grew far down to the water's edge, so that the last\nones dipped their petals into the lake itself.\n\nNestling upon this bank of flowers the Royal Messenger turned to his\ncompanions and said:\n\n\"Here let us rest for a time, while I call the friendly fishes to\nentertain you.\"\n\nHe ended his speech with a peculiar warble, and at its sound a score of\nfishes thrust their heads above the surface of the water. Some of them\nwere gold-fish and some silver-fish, but others had opal tints that\nwere very pretty. Their faces were jolly in expression and their eyes,\nChubbins thought, must be diamonds, because they sparkled so brightly.\n\nSwimming softly here and there in the lovely waters of the Lustrous\nLake, the fishes sang this song:\n\n  \"We are the fishes of the lake;\n  Our lives are very deep;\n  We're always active when awake\n  And quiet when asleep.\n\n  \"We get our fins from Finland,\n  From books we get out tales;\n  Our eyes they come from Eyerland\n  And weighty are our scales.\n\n  \"We love to flop and twist and turn\n  Whenever 'tis our whim.\n  Yet social etiquette we learn\n  Because we're in the swim.\n\n  \"Our beds, though damp, are always made;\n  We need no fires to warm us;\n  When we swim out we're not afraid,\n  For autos cannot harm us.\n\n  \"We're independent little fish\n  And never use umbrellas.\n  We do exactly as we wish\n  And live like jolly fellows.\"\n\nAs the fishes concluded their song they leaped high into the air and\nthen plunged under the water and disappeared, and it was hard to tell\nwhich sparkled most brilliantly, their gold and silver bodies or the\nspray of jewels they scattered about them as they leaped.\n\n\"If you should dive into this lake,\" said Ephel the Messenger, \"your\nfeathers would be dripping wet when you came out again. It is here we\nBirds of Paradise bathe each morning, after which we visit the Gleaming\nGlade to perform our Beauty Dance.\"\n\n\"I should like to see that glade,\" said Twinkle, who was determined to\nlet nothing escape her that she could possibly see.\n\n\"You shall,\" answered Ephel, promptly. \"We will fly there at once.\"\n\nSo he led the way and presently they entered a thicker grove of trees\nthan any they had before noticed. The trunks were so close together\nthat the birds could only pass between then in single file, but as they\nproceeded in this fashion it was not long before they came to a\ncircular space which the child-lark knew at once must be the Gleaming\nGlade.\n\nThe floor was of polished gold, and so bright that as they stood upon\nit they saw their forms reflected as in a mirror. The trees surrounding\nthem were also of gold, being beautifully engraved with many attractive\ndesigns and set with rows of brilliant diamonds. The leaves of the\ntrees, however, were of burnished silver, and bore so high a gloss that\neach one served as a looking-glass, reproducing the images of those\nstanding in the glade thousands of times, whichever way they chanced to\nturn.\n\nThe gleam of these mirror-like leaves was exceedingly brilliant, but\nEphel said this radiance was much stronger in the morning, when the\nrosy glow of the atmosphere was not so powerful.\n\n\"Then,\" said he, \"the King Bird and all the Nobility of Paradise, who\nrejoice in the most brilliant plumage, come here from their bath and\ndance upon the golden floor the Beauty Dance, which keeps their blood\nwarm until the feathers have all dried. While they dance they can\nadmire their reflections in the mirrors, which adds greatly to their\npleasure.\"\n\n\"Don't they have music to dance by?\" asked Chubbins.\n\n\"Of course,\" the Messenger replied. \"There is a regular orchestra that\nplays exquisite music for the dance; but the musicians are the female\nBirds of Paradise, who, because their plumage is a modest brown, are\nnot allowed to take part in the Beauty Dance.\"\n\n\"I think the brown birds with the soft gray breasts are just as pretty\nas the gaily clothed ones,\" said Twinkle. \"The male birds are too\nbright, and tire my eyes.\"\n\nEphel did not like this speech, for he was very proud of his own\ngorgeous coloring; but he was too polite to argue with his guest, so he\nlet the remark pass.\n\n\"You have now witnessed the most attractive scenes in our favored\nland,\" he said; \"but there are some curious sights in the suburbs that\nmight serve to interest you.\"\n\n\"Oh! have you suburbs, too?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes, indeed. We do not like to come into too close contact with the\ncoarse, outer world, so we have placed the flying things that are not\nbirds midway between our Paradise and the great forest. They serve us\nwhen we need them, and are under our laws and regulations; but they are\nso highly favored by being permitted to occupy the outer edge of our\nglorious Paradise that they willingly obey their masters. After all,\nthey live happy lives, and their habits, as I have said, may amuse you.\n\n\"Who are they?\" enquired Chubbins.\n\n\"Come with me, and you shall see for yourselves.\"\n\nThey flew away from the grove of the Gleaming Glade and Ephel led them\nby pleasant routes into a large garden with many pretty flowers in it.\nMostly it was filled with hollyhocks--yellow, white, scarlet and\npurple.\n\n\n\n[CHAPTER XVII] _The Queen Bee_\n\nAs they approached they heard a low, humming sound, which grew louder\nas they advanced and aroused their curiosity.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Twinkle, at last.\n\nEphel answered: \"It is the suburb devoted to the bees.\"\n\n\"But bees are not birds!\" exclaimed Twinkle.\n\n\"No; as I have told you, the suburbs contain flying things that cannot\nbe called birds, and so are unable to live in our part of the Paradise.\nBut because they have wings, and love all the flowers and fruits as we\ndo ourselves, we have taken them under our protection.\"\n\nEphel perched upon a low bush, and when the child-larks had settled\nbeside him he uttered a peculiar, shrill whistle. The humming sound\ngrew louder, then, and presently hundreds of great bees rose above the\nflower tops and hovered in the air. But none of them approached the\nbush except one monstrous bumble-bee that had a body striped with black\nand gold, and this one sailed slowly toward the visitors and alighted\ngracefully upon a branch in front of them.\n\nThe bee was all bristling with fine hairs and was nearly half as big as\nTwinkle herself; so the girl shrank back in alarm, and cried:\n\n\"Oh-h-h! I'm afraid it will sting me!\"\n\n\"How ridiculous!\" answered the bee, laughing in a small but merry\nvoice. \"Our stings are only for our enemies, and we have no enemies in\nthis Paradise; so we do not use our stingers at all. In fact, I'd\nalmost forgotten I had one, until you spoke.\"\n\nThe words were a little mumbled, as if the insect had something in its\nmouth, but otherwise they were quite easy to understand.\n\n\"Permit me to introduce her Majesty the Queen Bee,\" said their guide.\n\"These, your highness, are some little child-larks who are guests of\nour King. I have brought them to visit you.\"\n\n\"They are very welcome,\" returned the Queen Bee. \"Are you fond of\nhoney?\" she asked, turning to the children.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" replied Chubbins; \"but we've just eaten, and we're chock\nfull now.\"\n\n\"You see,\" the Queen remarked, \"my people are all as busy as bees\ngathering the honey from every flower.\"\n\n\"What do you do with it?\" asked Twinkle.\n\n\"Oh, we eat part of it, and store up the rest for a rainy day.\"\n\n\"Does it ever rain here?\" enquired Chubbins.\n\n\"Sometimes, at night, when we are all asleep, so as to refresh and\nmoisten the flowers, and help them to grow.\"\n\n\"But if it rains at night, there can't be any rainy days,\" remarked\nTwinkle; \"so I can't see the use of saving your honey.\"\n\n\"Nor can I,\" responded the Queen, laughing again in her pleasant way.\n\"Out in the world people usually rob us of our stores, and so keep us\nbusy getting more. But here there are not even robbers, so that the\nhoney has been accumulating until we hardly know what to do with it. We\nhave built a village of honeycombs, and I have just had my people make\nme a splendid palace of honey. But it is our way to gather the sweet\nstuff, whether we need it or not, so we have to act according to our\nnatures. I think of building a mountain of honey next.\"\n\n\"I'd like to see that honey palace,\" said Twinkle.\n\n\"Then come with me,\" answered the Queen Bee, \"for it will give me\npleasure to show it to you.\"\n\n\"Shall we go?\" asked the girl-lark, turning to Ephel.\n\n\"Of course,\" he returned. \"It is quite a wonderful sight, and may\ninterest you.\"\n\nSo they all flew away, the Queen Bee taking the lead, and passed\ndirectly over the bed of flowers with its swarm of buzzing, busy bees.\n\n\"They remind me of a verse from 'Father Goose,'\" said Twinkle, looking\ncuriously but half fearfully at the hundreds of big insects.\n\n\"What is the verse?\" asked the Queen.\n\n\"Why, it goes this way,\" answered the girl:\n\n  \"'A bumble-bee was buzzing on a yellow hollyhock\n  When came along a turtle, who at the bee did mock,\n  Saying \"Prithee, Mr. Bumble, why make that horrid noise?\n  It's really distracting, and every one annoys.\"\n\n  \"'\"I'm sorry,\" said, quite humble, the busy droning bee,\n  \"The noise is just my bumble, and natural, you see.\n  And if I didn't buzz so I'm sure that you'll agree\n  I'd only be a big fly, and not a bumble-bee.\"'\"\n\n\"That is quite true,\" said the bee, \"and describes our case exactly.\nBut you should know that we are not named 'bumblebees' by rights, but\n'Humble Bees.' The latter is our proper name.\"\n\n\"But why 'humble?'\" asked Twinkle.\n\n\"Because we are common, work-a-day people, I suppose, and not very\naristocratic,\" was the reply. \"I've never heard why they changed our\nname to 'bumble,' but since you recited that verse I imagine it is on\naccount of the noise our wings make.\"\n\nThey had now passed over the flower beds and approached a remarkable\nvillage, where the houses were all formed of golden-yellow honey-combs.\nThere were many pretty shapes among these houses, and some were large\nand many stories in height while others were small and had but one\nstory. Some had spires and minarets reaching up into the air, and all\nwere laid out into streets just like a real village.\n\nBut in the center stood a great honey-comb building with so many gables\nand roofs and peaks and towers that it was easy to guess it was the\nQueen Bee's palace, of which she had spoken.\n\nThey flew in at a second-story window and found themselves in a big\nroom with a floor as smooth as glass. Yet it was composed of man\nsix-sided cells filled with honey, which could be seen through the\ntransparent covering. The walls and roof were of the same material, and\nat the end of the room was a throne shaped likewise of the honey cells,\nlike everything else. On a bench along the wall sat several fat and\nsleepy-looking bumble-bees, who scarcely woke up when their queen\nentered.\n\n\"Those are the drones,\" she said to her visitors. \"It is useless to\nchide them for their laziness, because they are too stupid to pay\nattention to even a good scolding. Don't mind them in any way.\"\n\nAfter examining the beautiful throne-room, they visited the sleeping\nchambers, of which there were many, and afterward the parlors and\ndining-room and the work-rooms.\n\nIn these last were many bees building the six-sided pockets or cells\nfor storing the honey in, or piling them up in readiness for the return\nof those who were gathering honey from the flowers.\n\n\"We are not really honey-bees,\" remarked the Queen; \"but gathering\nhoney is our chief business, after all, and we manage to find a lot of\nit.\"\n\n\"Won't your houses melt when it rains?\" asked Twinkle.\n\n\"No, for the comb of the honey is pure wax,\" the Queen Bee replied.\n\"Water does not melt it at all.\"\n\n\"Where do you get all the wax?\" Chubbins enquired.\n\n\"From the flowers, of course. It grows on the stamens, and is a fine\ndust called pollen, until we manufacture it into wax. Each of my bees\ncarries two sacks, one in front of him, to put the honey in, and one\nbehind to put the wax in.\"\n\n\"That's funny,\" said the boy-lark.\n\n\"I suppose it may be, to you,\" answered the Queen, \"but to us it is a\nvery natural thing.\"\n\n\n\n[CHAPTER XVIII] _Good News_\n\nEphel and the children now bade the good-natured Queen Bee good-bye,\nand thanked her for her kindness. The Messenger led them far away to\nanother place that he called a \"suburb,\" and as they emerged from a\nthick cluster of trees into a second flower garden they found the air\nfilled with a great assemblage of butterflies, they being both large\nand small in size and colored in almost every conceivable manner.\n\nTwinkle and Chubbins had seen many beautiful butterflies, but never\nsuch magnificent ones as these, nor so many together at one time. Some\nof them had wings fully as large as those of the Royal Messenger\nhimself, even when he spread them to their limit, and the markings of\nthese big butterfly wings were more exquisite than those found upon the\ntail-feathers of the proudest peacocks.\n\nThe butterflies paid no attention to their visitors, but continued to\nflutter aimlessly from flower to flower. Chubbins asked one of them a\nquestion, but got no reply.\n\n\"Can't they talk?\" he enquired of Ephel.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Messenger, \"they all know how to talk, but when they\nspeak they say nothing that is important. They are brainless, silly\ncreatures, for the most part, and are only interesting because they are\nbeautiful to look at. The King likes to watch the flashes of color as\nthey fly about, and so he permits them to live in this place. They are\nvery happy here, in their way, for there is no one to chase them or to\nstick pins through them when they are caught.\"\n\nJust then a chime of bells tinkled far away in the distance, and the\nRoyal Messenger listened intently and then said:\n\n\"It is my summons to his Majesty the King. We must return at once to\nthe palace.\"\n\nSo they flew into the air again and proceeded to cross the lovely\ngardens and pass through the avenues of jewelled trees and the fragrant\norchards and groves until they came at last to the royal bower of white\nflowers.\n\nThe child-larks entered with their guide and found the gorgeous King\nBird of Paradise still strutting on his perch on the golden bush and\nenjoying the admiring glances of his courtiers and the ladies of his\nfamily. He turned as the children entered and addressed his Messenger,\nsaying:\n\n\"Well, my dear Ephel, have you shown the strangers all the sights of\nour lovely land?\"\n\n\"Most of them, your Majesty,\" replied Ephel.\n\n\"What do you think of us now?\" asked the King, turning his eyes upon\nthe lark-children.\n\n\"It must be the prettiest place in all the world!\" cried Twinkle, with\nreal enthusiasm.\n\nHis Majesty seemed much pleased. \"I am very sorry you cannot live here\nalways,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm not,\" declared Chubbins. \"It's too pretty. I'd get tired of it\nsoon.\"\n\n\"He means,\" said Twinkle, hastily, for she feared the blunt remark\nwould displease the kindly King, \"that he isn't really a bird, but a\nboy who has been forced to wear a bird's body. And your Majesty is wise\nenough to understand that the sort of life you lead in your fairy\nparadise would be very different from the life that boys generally\nlead.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" replied the King. \"A boy's life must be a dreadful one.\"\n\n\"It suits me, all right,\" said Chubbins.\n\nThe King looked at him attentively.\n\n\"Would you really prefer to resume your old shape, and cease to be a\nbird?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, if I could,\" Chubbins replied.\n\n\"Then I will tell you how to do it,\" said the King. \"Since you told me\nyour strange story I have talked with my Royal Necromancer, who knows a\ngood deal about magic, and especially about that same tuxix who\nwickedly transformed you in the forest. And the Royal Necromancer tells\nme that if you can find a tingle-berry, and eat it, you will resume\nyour natural form again. For it is the one antidote in all the world\nfor the charm the tuxix worked upon you.\"\n\n\"What _is_ a tingle-berry?\" asked Twinkle, anxiously, for this\ninformation interested her as much as it did Chubbins.\n\n\"I do not know,\" said the King, \"for it is a common forest berry, and\nnever grows in our paradise. But doubtless you will have little trouble\nin finding the bush of the tingle-berry when you return to the outside\nworld.\"\n\nThe children were both eager to go at once and seek the tingle-berry;\nbut they could not be so impolite as to run away just then, for the\nKing announced that he had prepared an entertainment in their honor.\n\nSo they sat on a branch of the golden bush beside their friend Ephel,\nwhile at a nod from the King a flock of the beautiful Birds of Paradise\nflew into the bower and proceeded to execute a most delightful and\nbewildering set of aerial evolutions. They flew swiftly in circles,\nspirals, triangles, and solid squares, and all the time that they\nperformed sweet music was played by some unseen band. It almost dazzled\nthe eyes of the child-larks to watch this brilliant flashing of the\ncolored wings of the birds, but the evolutions only lasted for a few\nminutes, and then the birds flew out again in regular ranks.\n\nThen the little brown lady-birds danced gracefully upon the carpet,\ntheir dainty feet merely touching the tips of the lovely flowers.\nAfterward the flowers themselves took part, and sang a delightful\nchorus, and when this was finished the King said they would now indulge\nin some refreshment.\n\nInstantly a row of bell-shaped blossoms appeared upon the golden bush,\none for each bird present, and all were filled with a delicious ice\nthat was as cold and refreshing as if it had just been taken from a\nfreezer. Twinkle and Chubbins asked for spoons, and received them\nquickly; but the others all ate the ices with their bills.\n\nThe King seemed to enjoy his as much as any one, and Twinkle noticed\nthat as fast as a blossom was emptied of its contents it disappeared\nfrom the branch.\n\nThe child-larks now thanked the beautiful but vain King very earnestly\nfor all his kindness to them, and especially for telling them about the\ntingle-berries; and when all the good-byes had been exchanged Ephel\nflew with them back to the tree where they had left the Guardian of the\nEntrance and their faithful comrade, Policeman Bluejay.\n\n\n\n[CHAPTER XIX] _The Rebels_\n\nThey were warmly greeted by the bluejay, who asked:\n\n\"Did you enjoy the wonderful Paradise?\"\n\n\"Very much, indeed,\" cried Twinkle. \"But we were sorry you could not be\nwith us.\"\n\n\"Never mind that,\" returned the policeman, cheerfully. \"I have feasted\nmy eyes upon all the beauties visible from this tree, and my good\nfriend the Guardian has talked to me and given me much good advice that\nwill surely be useful to me in the future. So I have been quite\ncontented while you were gone.\"\n\nThe children now gave their thanks to Ephel for his care of them and\npolite attention, and the Royal Messenger said he was pleased that the\nKing had permitted him to serve them. They also thanked the green-robed\nGuardian of the Entrance, and then, accompanied by Policeman Bluejay,\nthey quitted the golden tree and began their journey back to the\nforest.\n\nIt was no trouble at all to return. The wind caught their wings and\nblew against them strongly, so that they had but to sail before the\nbreeze and speed along until they were deep in the forest again. Then\nthe wind moderated, and presently died away altogether, so that they\nwere forced to begin flying in order to continue their journey home.\n\nIt was now the middle of the afternoon, and the policeman said:\n\n\"I hope all has been quiet and orderly during my absence. There are so\nmany disturbing elements among the forest birds that I always worry\nwhen they are left alone for many hours at a time.\"\n\n\"I'm sure they have behaved themselves,\" returned Twinkle. \"They fear\nyour power so much that the evil-minded birds do not dare to offend you\nby being naughty.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said the policeman. \"They know very well that I will\nnot stand any nonsense, and will always insist that the laws be\nobeyed.\"\n\nThey were now approaching that part of the forest where they lived, and\nas the policeman concluded his speech they were surprised to hear a\ngreat flutter of wings among the trees, and presently a flock of big\nblack rooks flew toward them.\n\nAt the head of the band was a saucy-looking fellow who wore upon his\nhead a policeman's helmet, and carried under his wing a club.\n\nPoliceman Bluejay gave a cry of anger as he saw this, and dashed\nforward to meet the rooks.\n\n\"What does this mean, you rascal?\" he demanded, in a fierce voice.\n\n\"Easy there, my fine dandy,\" replied the rook, with a hoarse laugh.\n\"Don't get saucy, or I'll give you a rap on the head!\"\n\nThe rooks behind him shrieked with delight at this impudent speech, and\nthat made the mock policeman strut more absurdly than ever.\n\nThe bluejay was not only astonished at this rebellion but he was\nterribly angry as well.\n\n\"That is my policeman's helmet and club,\" he said sternly. \"Where did\nyou get them?\"\n\n\"At your nest, of course,\" retorted the other. \"We made up our minds\nthat we have had a miserable bluejay for a policeman long enough; so\nthe rooks elected me in your place, and I'm going to make you birds\nstand around and obey orders, I can tell you! If you do as I command,\nyou'll get along all right; if you don't, I'll pound you with your own\nclub until you obey.\"\n\nAgain the rooks screamed in an admiring chorus of delight, and when the\nbluejay observed their great numbers, and that they were all as large\nas he was, and some even larger and stronger, he decided not to risk an\nopen fight with them just then, but to take time to think over what had\nbest be done.\n\n\"I will call the other birds to a meeting,\" he said to the rook, \"and\nlet them decide between us.\"\n\n\"That won't do any good,\" was the reply. \"We rooks have decided the\nmatter already. We mean to rule the forest, after this, and if any one,\nor all of the birds, dare to oppose us, we'll fight until we force them\nto serve us. Now, then, what do you intend to do about it?\"\n\n\"I'll think it over,\" said Policeman Bluejay.\n\n\"Oho! oho! He's afraid! He's a coward!\" yelled the rooks; and one of\nthem added:\n\n\"Stand up and fight, if you dare!\"\n\n\"I'll fight your false policeman, or any one of you at a time,\" replied\nthe bluejay.\n\n\"No, you won't; you'll fight us all together, or not at all,\" they\nanswered.\n\nThe bluejay knew it would be foolish to do that, so he turned away and\nwhispered to the lark-children:\n\n\"Follow me, and fly as swiftly as you can.\"\n\nLike a flash he darted high into the air, with Twinkle and Chubbins\nright behind him, and before the rooks could recover from their\nsurprise the three were far away.\n\nThen the big black birds gave chase, uttering screams of rage; but they\ncould not fly so swiftly as the bluejay and the larks, and were soon\nobliged to abandon the pursuit.\n\nWhen at last he knew that they had escaped the rooks, Policeman Bluejay\nentered the forest again and went among the birds to call them all to a\nmeeting. They obeyed the summons without delay, and were very indignant\nwhen they heard of the rebellion of the rooks and the insults that had\nbeen heaped upon their regularly elected officer. Judge Bullfinch\narrived with his head bandaged with soft feathers, for he had met the\nrook policeman and, when he remonstrated, had been severely pounded by\nthe wicked bird's club.\n\n\"But what can we do?\" he asked. \"The rooks are a very powerful tribe,\nand the magpies and cuckoos and blackbirds are liable to side with\nthem, if they seem to be stronger than we are.\"\n\n\"We might get all our people together and fall upon them in a great\narmy, and so defeat them,\" suggested an oriole.\n\n\"The trouble with that plan,\" decided the judge, \"is that we can only\ndepend upon the smaller birds. The big birds might desert us, and in\nthat case we would be badly beaten.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it will be better to submit to the rooks,\" said a little\nchickadee, anxiously. \"We are neither warriors nor prizefighters, and\nif we obey our new rulers they may leave us in peace.\"\n\n\"No, indeed!\" cried a linnet. \"If we submit to them they will think we\nare afraid, and will treat us cruelly. I know the nature of these\nrooks, and believe they can only be kept from wickedness by a power\nstronger than their own.\"\n\n\"Hear me, good friends,\" said the bluejay, who had been silent because\nhe was seriously thinking; \"I have a plan for subduing these rebels,\nand it is one that I am sure will succeed. But I must make a long\njourney to accomplish my purpose. Go now quietly to your nests; but\nmeet me at the Judgment Tree at daybreak to-morrow morning. Also be\nsure to ask every friendly bird of the forest to be present, for we\nmust insist upon preserving our liberty, or else be forever slaves to\nthese rooks.\"\n\nWith these words he rose into the air and sped swiftly upon his errand.\n\nThe other birds looked after him earnestly.\n\n\"I think it will be well for us to follow his advice,\" said Judge\nBullfinch, after a pause. \"The bluejay is an able bird, and has had\nmuch experience. Besides, we have ever found him just and honorable\nsince the time we made him our policeman, so I feel that we may depend\nupon him in this emergency.\"\n\n\"Why, it is all we can do,\" replied a robin; and this remark was so\ntrue that the birds quietly dispersed and returned to their nests to\nawait the important meeting the next morning.\n\n\n\n[CHAPTER XX] _The Battle_\n\nTwinkle and Chubbins flew slowly home to their nests in the maple tree,\npausing to ask every bird they met where tingle-berries grew. But none\nof them could tell.\n\n\"I'm sorry we did not ask Policeman Bluejay,\" said Chubbins.\n\n\"I intended to ask him, but we hadn't time,\" replied Twinkle. \"But he\nwill be back to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"I wonder what he's going to do,\" remarked the boy.\n\n\"Don't know, Chub; but it'll be the right thing, whatever it is. You\nmay be sure of that.\"\n\nThey visited the nest of the baby goldfinches, and found the Widow\nChaffinch still caring for the orphans in her motherly way. The little\nones seemed to be as hungry as ever, but the widow assured the\nlark-children that all five had just been fed.\n\n\"Did you ever hear of a tingle-berry?\" asked Twinkle.\n\n\"Yes; it seems to me I have heard of that berry,\" was the reply. \"If I\nremember rightly my grandmother once told me of the tingle-berries, and\nwarned me never to eat one. But I am quite certain the things do not\ngrow in our forest, for I have never seen one that I can recollect.\"\n\n\"Where do they grow, then?\" enquired Chubbins.\n\n\"I can't say exactly where; but if they are not in the forest, they\nmust grow in the open country.\"\n\nThe child-larks now returned to their own nest, and sat snuggled up in\nit during the evening, talking over the day's experiences and the\nwonderful things they had seen in the fairy-like Paradise of the Birds.\nSo much sight-seeing had made them tired, so when it grew dark they\nfell fast asleep, and did not waken until the sun was peeping over the\nedge of the trees.\n\n\"Good gracious!\" exclaimed the girl, \"we shall be late at the meeting\nat the Judgment Tree. Let's hurry, Chub.\"\n\nThey ate a hasty breakfast from the contents of their basket, and after\nflying to the brook for a drink and a dip in the cool water they\nhurried toward the Judgment Tree.\n\nThere they found a vast assemblage of birds. They were so numerous,\nindeed, that Twinkle was surprised to find that so many of them\ninhabited the forest.\n\nBut a still greater surprise was in store for her, for immediately she\ndiscovered sitting upon the biggest branch of the tree twenty-two\nbluejays, all in a row. They were large, splendidly plumaged birds,\nwith keen eyes and sharp bills, and at their head was the children's\nold friend, the policeman.\n\n\"These are my cousins,\" he said to the child-larks, proudly, \"and I\nhave brought them from another forest, where they live, to assist me. I\nam not afraid of the foolish rooks now, and in a moment we shall fly\naway to give them battle.\"\n\nThe forest birds were all in a flutter of delight at the prompt arrival\nof the powerful bluejays, and when the word of command was given they\nall left the tree and flew swiftly to meet the rooks.\n\nFirst came the ranks of the twenty-two bluejays, with the policeman at\ntheir head. Then followed many magpies and cuckoos, who were too clever\nto side with the naughty rooks when they saw the powerful birds the\nbluejay had summoned to his assistance. After these flew the smaller\nbirds, of all descriptions, and they were so many and at the same time\nso angry that they were likely to prove stubborn foes in a fight.\n\nThis vast army came upon the rooks in an open space in the forest.\nWithout waiting for any words or explanations from the rebels, the\nsoldierly bluejays fell upon their enemies instantly, fighting fiercely\nwith bill and claw, while the other birds fluttered in the rear,\nawaiting their time to join in the affray.\n\nPoliceman Bluejay singled out the rook which had stolen his helmet and\nclub, and dashed upon him so furiously that the black rebel was amazed,\nand proved an easy victim to the other's superior powers. He threw down\nthe club and helmet at once; but the bluejay was not satisfied with\nthat, and attacked the thief again and again, until the air was full of\nblack feathers torn from the rook's body.\n\nAfter all, the battle did not last long; for the rooks soon screamed\nfor mercy, and found themselves badly plucked and torn by the time\ntheir assailants finally decided they had been punished enough.\n\nLike all blustering, evil-disposed people, when they found themselves\nconquered they whined and humbled themselves before the victors and\ndeclared they would never again rebel against Policeman Bluejay, the\nregularly appointed guardian of the Law of the Forest. And I am told\nthat after this day the rooks, who are not rightly forest birds, betook\nthemselves to the nearest villages and farm houses, and contented\nthemselves with plaguing mankind, who could not revenge themselves as\neasily as the birds did.\n\nAfter the fight Policeman Bluejay thanked his cousins and sent them\nhome again, and then the birds all surrounded the policeman and cheered\nhim gratefully for his cleverness and bravery, so that he was the hero\nof the hour.\n\nJudge Bullfinch tried to make a fine speech, but the birds were too\nexcited to listen to his words, and he soon found himself without an\naudience.\n\nOf course, Twinkle and Chubbins took no part in the fight, but they had\nhovered in the background to watch it, and were therefore as proud of\ntheir friend as any of the forest birds could be.\n\n\n\n[CHAPTER XXI] _The Tingle-Berries_\n\nWhen the excitement of the morning had subsided and the forest was\nquiet again, Policeman Bluejay came to the nest of the child-larks,\nwearing his official helmet and club. You may be sure that one of the\nfirst things Twinkle asked him was if he knew where tingle-berries\ngrew.\n\n\"Of course,\" he replied, promptly. \"They grow over at the north edge of\nthe forest, in the open country. But you must never eat them, my dear\nfriend, because they are very bad for birds.\"\n\n\"But the Royal Necromancer of the King Bird of Paradise says the\ntingle-berries will restore us to our proper forms,\" explained the\ngirl.\n\n\"Oh; did he say that? Then he probably knows,\" said the bluejay, \"and I\nwill help you to find the berries. We birds always avoid them, for they\ngive us severe pains in our stomachs.\"\n\n\"That's bad,\" observed Chubbins, uneasily.\n\n\"Well,\" said Twinkle, \"I'd be willing to have a pain or two, just to be\nmyself again.\"\n\n\"So would I, if it comes to that,\" agreed the boy. \"But I'd rather have\nfound a way to be myself without getting the pain.\"\n\n\"There is usually but one thing that will overcome an enchantment,\"\nremarked the bluejay, seriously; \"and if it is a tingle-berry that will\ndestroy the charm which the old tuxix put upon you, then nothing else\nwill answer the same purpose. The Royal Necromancer is very wise, and\nyou may depend upon what he says. But it is late, at this season, for\ntingle-berries. They do not grow at all times of the year, and we may\nnot be able to find any upon the bushes.\"\n\n\"Cannot we go at once and find out?\" asked Twinkle, anxiously.\n\n\"To be sure. It will grieve me to lose you, my little friends, but I\nwant to do what will give you the most happiness. Come with me,\nplease.\"\n\nThey flew away through the forest, and by and by came upon the open\ncountry to the north, leaving all the trees behind them.\n\n\"Why, this is the place we entered the forest, that day we got\n'chanted!\" cried Twinkle.\n\n\"So it is,\" said Chubbins. \"I believe we could find our way home from\nhere, Twink.\"\n\n\"But we can't go home like we are,\" replied the girl-lark. \"What would\nour folks say, to find us with birds' bodies?\"\n\n\"They'd yell and run,\" declared the boy.\n\n\"Then,\" said she, \"we must find the tingle-berries.\"\n\nThe bluejay flew with them to some bushes which he said were the kind\nthe tingle-berries grew upon, but they were all bare and not a single\nberry could be found.\n\n\"There must be more not far away,\" said the policeman, encouragingly.\n\"Let us look about us.\"\n\nThey found several clumps of the bushes, to be sure; but unfortunately\nno berries were now growing upon them, and at each failure the children\ngrew more and more sad and despondent.\n\n\"If we have to wait until the bushes bear again,\" Twinkle remarked, \"it\nwill be nearly a year, and I'm sure we can't live in the forest all\nwinter.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked the policeman.\n\n\"The food in our basket would all be gone, and then we would starve to\ndeath,\" was the reply. \"We can't eat bugs and worms, you know.\"\n\n\"I'd rather die!\" declared Chubbins, mournfully.\n\nThe bluejay became very thoughtful.\n\n\"If we could find some of the tingle bushes growing near the shade of\nthe forest,\" he said at last, \"there might still be some berries\nremaining on them. Out here in the bright sunshine the berries soon\nwither and drop off and disappear.\"\n\n\"Then let us look near the trees,\" suggested Twinkle.\n\nThey searched for a long time unsuccessfully. It was growing late, and\nthey were almost in despair, when a sharp cry from Policeman Bluejay\ndrew the child-larks to his side.\n\n\"What is it?\" enquired the girl, trembling with nervous excitement.\n\n\"Why,\" said the policeman, \"here is a bush at last, and on it are\nexactly two ripe tingle-berries!\"\n\n\n\n[CHAPTER XXII] _The Transformation_\n\nThey looked earnestly at the bush, and saw that their friend spoke\ntruly. Upon a high limb was one plump, red berry, looking much like a\ncranberry, while lower down grew another but smaller berry, which\nappeared to be partially withered.\n\n\"Good!\" the lark-children cried, joyfully; and the next moment Chubbins\nadded: \"You eat the big berry, Twink.\"\n\n\"Why?\" she asked, hesitating.\n\n\"It looks as if it had more stomach-ache in it,\" he replied.\n\n\"I'm not afraid of that,\" said she. \"But do you suppose the little\nberry will be enough for you? One side of it is withered, you see.\"\n\n\"That won't matter,\" returned the boy-lark. \"The Royal Necromancer said\nto eat one berry. He didn't say a little or a big one, you know, or\nwhether it should be plump or withered.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said the girl-lark. \"Shall I eat mine now?\"\n\n\"The sooner the better,\" Chubbins replied.\n\n\"Don't forget me, little friend, when you are a human again,\" said\nPoliceman Bluejay, sadly.\n\n\"I shall never forget you,\" Twinkle answered, \"nor any part of all your\nkindness to us. We shall be friends forever.\"\n\nThat seemed to please the handsome blue bird, and Twinkle was so eager\nthat she could not wait to say more. She plucked the big, plump berry,\nput it in her mouth with her little claw, and ate it as soon as\npossible.\n\nIn a moment she said: \"Ouch! Oo-oo-oo!\" But it did not hurt so badly,\nafter all. Her form quickly changed and grew larger; and while Chubbins\nand Policeman Bluejay watched her anxiously she became a girl again,\nand the bird's body with its soft gray feathers completely disappeared.\n\nAs she felt herself changing she called: \"Good-bye!\" to the bluejay;\nbut even then he could hardly understand her words.\n\n\"Good-bye!\" he answered, and to Twinkle's ears it sounded like\n\"Chir-r-rip-chee-wee!\"\n\n\"How did it feel?\" asked Chubbins; but she looked at him queerly, as if\nhis language was strange to her, and seemed to be half frightened.\n\n\"Guess I'll have to eat my berry,\" he said, with a laugh, and proceeded\nto pluck and eat it, as Twinkle had done. He yelled once or twice at\nthe cramp the fruit gave him, but as soon as the pain ceased he began\nto grow and change in the same way his little comrade had.\n\nBut not entirely. For although he got his human body and legs back\nagain, all in their natural size, his wings remained as they were, and\nit startled him to find that the magic power had passed and he was\nstill partly a bird.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Twinkle.\n\n\"Is anything wrong?\" enquired the bluejay.\n\nThe boy understood them both, although they could not now understand\neach other. He said to Twinkle:\n\n\"I guess the berry wasn't quite big enough.\" Then he repeated the same\nthing in the bird language to Policeman Bluejay, and it sounded to\nTwinkle like:\n\n\"Pir-r-r-r--eep--cheep--tweet!\"\n\n\"What in the world can you do?\" asked the girl, quite distressed. \"It\nwill be just dreadful if you have to stay like that.\"\n\nThe tears came to Chubbins' eyes. He tried to restrain them, but could\nnot. He flapped his little wings dolefully and said:\n\n\"I wish I was either one thing or the other! I'd rather be a child-lark\nagain, and nest in a tree, than to go home to the folks in this way.\"\n\nPoliceman Bluejay had seen his dilemma at the first, and his sharp eyes\nhad been roving over all the bushes that were within the range of his\nvision. Suddenly he uttered a chirp of delight and dashed away,\nspeedily returning with another tingle-berry in his bill.\n\n\"It's the very last one there is!\" said he to Chubbins.\n\n\"But it is all that I want,\" cried the boy, brightening at once; and\nthen, regardless of any pain, he ate the berry as greedily as if he was\nfond of a stomache-ache.\n\nThe second berry had a good effect in one way, for Chubbins' wings\nquickly became arms, and he was now as perfectly formed as he had been\nbefore he met with the cruel tuxix. But he gave a groan, every once in\na while, and Twinkle suspected that two berries were twice as powerful\nas one, and made a pain that lasted twice as long.\n\nAs the boy and girl looked around they were astonished to find their\nbasket standing on the ground beside them. On a limb of the first tree\nof the forest sat silently regarding them a big blue bird that they\nknew must be Policeman Bluejay, although somehow or other he had lost\nhis glossy black helmet and the club he had carried underneath his\nwing.\n\n\"It's almost dark,\" said Twinkle, yawning. \"Let's go home, Chub.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nHe picked up the basket, and for a few minutes they walked along in\nsilence.\n\nThen the boy asked:\n\n\"Don't your legs feel heavy, Twink?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said she; \"do yours?\"\n\n\"Awful,\" said he.\n\n\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\nL.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":49,"split":"train"}
