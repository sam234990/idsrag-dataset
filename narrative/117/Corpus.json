Wealthy Paul D\u00e9roul\u00e8de has offended the young Vicomte de Marny by speaking disrespectfully of his latest infatuation, Ad\u00e8le de Monterch\u00e9ri. D\u00e9roul\u00e8de had not intended to get into the quarrel but has a tendency to blunder into things -- \"no doubt a part of the inheritance bequeathed to him by his bourgeois ancestry.\"\nIncensed at the slur on Ad\u00e8le, whom he sees as a paragon of virtue, the Vicomte challenges D\u00e9roul\u00e8de to a duel, a fight which D\u00e9roul\u00e8de does not want - for he knows and respects the boy's father, the Duc de Marny. Swords drawn, the fight ensues in the centre of the salon but despite his noble lineage, the Vicomte de Marny is no match for D\u00e9roul\u00e8de's swordplay, especially when addled with wine and rage. D\u00e9roul\u00e8de disarms his opponent and having won the duel, draws back but the boy refuses to back down without complete satisfaction and demands that D\u00e9roul\u00e8de get down on his knees and apologize.\nFinally losing his temper with the young Vicomte, D\u00e9roul\u00e8de raises his sword to disarm his protagonist once more, however de Marny lunges wildly at his opponent's breast and manages to literally throw himself on D\u00e9roul\u00e8de's weapon. The boy is dead and D\u00e9roul\u00e8de can do nothing but leave the establishment.\nOn hearing of the death of his only son, the Duc de Marny (by now a cripple and almost a dotard) is distraught. The Duc summons his fourteen-year-old daughter, Juliette, to his side and forces her to swear an oath to ruin D\u00e9roulede in revenge for her brother's death, telling her that her brother's soul will remain in torment until the final judgement day should she break her promise.\nThe story picks up ten years later, and Citizen D\u00e9roul\u00e8de, though no longer rich, is a lawyer popular with the people and is allowed to go his own way, for Marat has said of him \"Il n'est pas dangereux\". He leads a quiet life, living alone with his mother and his orphaned cousin Anne Mie in the Rue Ecole de M\u00e9decine.\nAt 6 pm on August 19, 1793, Juliette Marny walks into the Rue Ecole de M\u00e9decine and stopping just outside the house belonging to Citizen-Deputy D\u00e9roul\u00e8de, suddenly starts to draw attention to herself, invoking the anger of the crowd through her proud aristocratic manner. She hammers on D\u00e9roul\u00e8de's door as the crowd shout and lash out at her, but just before they can drag her away, the door opens and she is pulled inside.\nHaving tricked her way into D\u00e9roulede's home Juliette is invited to stay for her own safety. She agrees and eventually reveals her identity, but even after hearing D\u00e9roulede's side of the story, she fails to realise that he only wishes to make amends for the death of her brother and continues to plot revenge on her host.\nUnaware of her intentions, D\u00e9roulede tells Juliette that he has accepted the post of Governor of the Conciergerie prison where Queen Marie Antoinette is imprisoned. Later he is visited at home by Sir Percy Blakeney and Juliette overhears Sir Percy warning his friend off a scheme to free the queen, for it is doomed to failure. He advises D\u00e9roulede to burn a bundle of papers relating to the plot, which if found would result in him being arrested for treason and sentenced to death.\nJuliette sees her chance and posts a letter denouncing her host, but realises too late that she has failed to take account of the fact that not only has Paul D\u00e9roulede fallen madly in love with her, she has also come to love the man she has vowed to destroy.\nWhen soldiers arrive to search D\u00e9roulede's home, Juliette hides the letter box, then escapes to her room where she attempts to burn it. She places the burnt remains among her belongings, and when the soldiers discover them, they arrest her. Because the search turned up nothing suspicious against D\u00e9roulede he is allowed to remain free.\nDuring her trial, Juliette keeps to the story that the burnt letterbox contained love letters. However, D\u00e9roulede defends his love and admits that the letters are his own and that he has committed treason. Both of them are sentenced to death.\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel and his comrades manage to rescue the condemned couple on their journey from the courthouse to the prison.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of I Will Repay, by Baroness Emmuska Orczy\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Coward! Coward!\"\n\nThe words rang out, clear, strident, passionate, in a crescendo of\nagonised humiliation.\n\nThe boy, quivering with rage, had sprung to his feet, and, losing his\nbalance, he fell forward clutching at the table, whilst with a\nconvulsive movement of the lids, he tried in vain to suppress the tears\nof shame which were blinding him.\n\n\"Coward!\" He tried to shout the insult so that all might hear, but his\nparched throat refused him service, his trembling hand sought the\nscattered cards upon the table, he collected them together, quickly,\nnervously, fingering them with feverish energy, then he hurled them at\nthe man opposite, whilst with a final effort he still contrived to\nmutter: \"Coward!\"\n\nThe older men tried to interpose, but the young ones only laughed, quite\nprepared for the adventure which must inevitably ensue, the only\npossible ending to a quarrel such as this.\n\nConciliation or arbitration was out of the question. D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de should\nhave known better than to speak disrespectfully of Ad\u00c3\u00a8le de Montch\u00c3\u00a9ri,\nwhen the little Vicomte de Marny's infatuation for the notorious beauty\nhad been the talk of Paris and Versailles these many months past.\n\nAd\u00c3\u00a8le was very lovely and a veritable tower of greed and egotism. The\nMarnys were rich and the little Vicomte very young, and just now the\nbrightly-plumaged hawk was busy plucking the latest pigeon, newly\narrived from its ancestral cote.\n\nThe boy was still in the initial stage of his infatuation. To him Ad\u00c3\u00a8le\nwas a paragon of all the virtues, and he would have done battle on her\nbehalf against the entire aristocracy of France, in a vain endeavour to\njustify his own exalted opinion of one of the most dissolute women of\nthe epoch. He was a first-rate swordsman too, and his friends had\nalready learned that it was best to avoid all allusions to Ad\u00c3\u00a8le's\nbeauty and weaknesses.\n\nBut D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de was a noted blunderer. He was little versed in the manners\nand tones of that high society in which, somehow, he still seemed an\nintruder. But for his great wealth, no doubt, he never would have been\nadmitted within the intimate circle of aristocratic France. His ancestry\nwas somewhat doubtful and his coat-of-arms unadorned with quarterings.\n\nBut little was known of his family or the origin of its wealth; it was\nonly known that his father had suddenly become the late King's dearest\nfriend, and commonly surmised that D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de gold had on more than one\noccasion filled the emptied coffers of the First Gentleman of France.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had not sought the present quarrel. He had merely blundered in\nthat clumsy way of his, which was no doubt a part of the inheritance\nbequeathed to him by his bourgeois ancestry.\n\nHe knew nothing of the little Vicomte's private affairs, still less of\nhis relationship with Ad\u00c3\u00a8le, but he knew enough of the world and enough\nof Paris to be acquainted with the lady's reputation. He hated at all\ntimes to speak of women. He was not what in those days would be termed a\nladies' man, and was even somewhat unpopular with the sex. But in this\ninstance the conversation had drifted in that direction, and when\nAd\u00c3\u00a8le's name was mentioned, every one became silent, save the little\nVicomte, who waxed enthusiastic.\n\nA shrug of the shoulders on D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's part had aroused the boy's ire,\nthen a few casual words, and, without further warning, the insult had\nbeen hurled and the cards thrown in the older man's face.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de did not move from his seat. He sat erect and placid, one knee\ncrossed over the other, his serious, rather swarthy face perhaps a shade\npaler than usual: otherwise it seemed as if the insult had never reached\nhis ears, or the cards struck his cheek.\n\nHe had perceived his blunder, just twenty seconds too late. Now he was\nsorry for the boy and angered with himself, but it was too late to draw\nback. To avoid a conflict he would at this moment have sacrificed half\nhis fortune, but not one particle of his dignity.\n\nHe knew and respected the old Duc de Marny, a feeble old man now, almost\na dotard whose hitherto spotless _blason_, the young Vicomte, his son,\nwas doing his best to besmirch.\n\nWhen the boy fell forward, blind and drunk with rage, D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de leant\ntowards him automatically, quite kindly, and helped him to his feet. He\nwould have asked the lad's pardon for his own thoughtlessness, had that\nbeen possible: but the stilted code of so-called honour forbade so\nlogical a proceeding. It would have done no good, and could but imperil\nhis own reputation without averting the traditional sequel.\n\nThe panelled walls of the celebrated gaming saloon had often witnessed\nscenes such as this. All those present acted by routine. The etiquette\nof duelling prescribed certain formalities, and these were strictly but\nrapidly adhered to.\n\nThe young Vicomte was quickly surrounded by a close circle of friends.\nHis great name, his wealth, his father's influence, had opened for him\nevery door in Versailles and Paris. At this moment he might have had an\narmy of seconds to support him in the coming conflict.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de for a while was left alone near the card table, where the\nunsnuffed candles began smouldering in their sockets. He had risen to\nhis feet, somewhat bewildered at the rapid turn of events. His dark,\nrestless eyes wandered for a moment round the room, as if in quick\nsearch for a friend.\n\nBut where the Vicomte was at home by right, D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had only been\nadmitted by reason of his wealth. His acquaintances and sycophants were\nmany, but his friends very few.\n\nFor the first time this fact was brought home to him. Every one in the\nroom must have known and realised that he had not wilfully sought this\nquarrel, that throughout he had borne himself as any gentleman would,\nyet now, when the issue was so close at hand, no one came forward to\nstand by him.\n\n\"For form's sake, monsieur, will you choose your seconds?\"\n\nIt was the young Marquis de Villefranche who spoke, a little haughtily,\nwith a certain ironical condescension towards the rich parvenu, who was\nabout to have the honour of crossing swords with one of the noblest\ngentlemen in France.\n\n\"I pray you, Monsieur le Marquis,\" rejoined D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de coldly, \"to make\nthe choice for me. You see, I have few friends in Paris.\"\n\nThe Marquis bowed, and gracefully flourished his lace handkerchief. He\nwas accustomed to being appealed to in all matters pertaining to\netiquette, to the toilet, to the latest cut in coats, and the procedure\nin duels. Good-natured, foppish, and idle, he felt quite happy and in\nhis element thus to be made chief organiser of the tragic farce, about\nto be enacted on the parquet floor of the gaming saloon.\n\nHe looked about the room for a while, scrutinising the faces of those\naround him. The gilded youth was crowding round De Marny; a few older\nmen stood in a group at the farther end of the room: to these the\nMarquis turned, and addressing one of them, an elderly man with a\nmilitary bearing and a shabby brown coat:\n\n\"Mon Colonel,\" he said, with another flourishing bow; \"I am deputed by\nM. D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de to provide him with seconds for this affair of honour, may\nI call upon you to ...\"\n\n\"Certainly, certainly,\" replied the Colonel. \"I am not intimately\nacquainted with M. D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, but since you stand sponsor, M. le Marquis\n...\"\n\n\"Oh!\" rejoined the Marquis, lightly, \"a mere matter of form, you know.\nM. D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de belongs to the entourage of Her Majesty. He is a man of\nhonour. But I am not his sponsor. Marny is my friend, and if you prefer\nnot to ...\"\n\n\"Indeed I am entirely at M. D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's service,\" said the Colonel, who\nhad thrown a quick, scrutinising glance at the isolated figure near the\ncard table, \"if he will accept my services ...\"\n\n\"He will be very glad to accept, my dear Colonel,\" whispered the Marquis\nwith an ironical twist of his aristocratic lips. \"He has no friends in\nour set, and if you and De Quettare will honour him, I think he should\nbe grateful.\"\n\nM. de Quettare, adjutant to M. le Colonel, was ready to follow in the\nfootsteps of his chief, and the two men, after the prescribed\nsalutations to M. le Marquis de Villefranche, went across to speak to\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de.\n\n\"If you will accept our services, monsieur,\" began the Colonel abruptly,\n\"mine, and my adjutant's, M. de Quettare, we place ourselves entirely at\nyour disposal.\"\n\n\"I thank you, messieurs,\" rejoined D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de. \"The whole thing is a\nfarce, and that young man is a fool; but I have been in the wrong and\n...\"\n\n\"You would wish to apologise?\" queried the Colonel icily.\n\nThe worthy soldier had heard something of D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's reputed bourgeois\nancestry. This suggestion of an apology was no doubt in accordance with\nthe customs of the middle-classes, but the Colonel literally gasped at\nthe unworthiness of the proceeding. An apology? Bah! Disgusting!\ncowardly! beneath the dignity of any gentleman, however wrong he might\nbe. How could two soldiers of His Majesty's army identify themselves\nwith such doings?\n\nBut D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de seemed unconscious of the enormity of his suggestion.\n\n\"If I could avoid a conflict,\" he said, \"I would tell the Vicomte that I\nhad no knowledge of his admiration for the lady we were discussing and\n...\"\n\n\"Are you so very much afraid of getting a sword scratch, monsieur?\"\ninterrupted the Colonel impatiently, whilst M. de Quettare elevated a\npair of aristocratic eyebrows in bewilderment at such an extraordinary\ndisplay of bourgeois cowardice.\n\n\"You mean, Monsieur le Colonel?\"--queried D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de.\n\n\"That you must either fight the Vicomte de Marny to-night, or clear out\nof Paris to-morrow. Your position in our set would become untenable,\"\nretorted the Colonel, not unkindly, for in spite of D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's\nextraordinary attitude, there was nothing in his bearing or his\nappearance that suggested cowardice or fear.\n\n\"I bow to your superior knowledge of your friends, M. le Colonel,\"\nresponded D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, as he silently drew his sword from its sheath.\n\nThe centre of the saloon was quickly cleared. The seconds measured the\nlength of the swords and then stood behind the antagonists, slightly in\nadvance of the groups of spectators, who stood massed all round the\nroom.\n\nThey represented the flower of what France had of the best and noblest\nin name, in lineage, in chivalry, in that year of grace 1783. The\nstorm-cloud which a few years hence was destined to break over their\nheads, sweeping them from their palaces to the prison and the\nguillotine, was only gathering very slowly in the dim horizon of\nsqualid, starving Paris: for the next half-dozen years they would still\ndance and gamble, fight and flirt, surround a tottering throne, and\nhoodwink a weak monarch. The Fates' avenging sword still rested in its\nsheath; the relentless, ceaseless wheel still bore them up in their\nwhirl of pleasure; the downward movement had only just begun: the cry of\nthe oppressed children of France had not yet been heard above the din of\ndance music and lovers' serenades.\n\nThe young Duc de Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaudun was there, he who, nine years later, went to\nthe guillotine on that cold September morning, his hair dressed in the\nlatest fashion, the finest Mechlin lace around his wrists, playing a\nfinal game of piquet with his younger brother, as the tumbril bore them\nalong through the hooting, yelling crowd of the half-naked starvelings\nof Paris.\n\nThere was the Vicomte de Mirepoix, who, a few years later, standing on\nthe platform of the guillotine, laid a bet with M. de Miranges that his\nown blood would flow bluer than that of any other head cut off that day\nin France. Citizen Samson heard the bet made, and when De Mirepoix's\nhead fell into the basket, the headsman lifted it up for M. de Miranges\nto see. The latter laughed.\n\n\"Mirepoix was always a braggart,\" he said lightly, as he laid his head\nupon the block.\n\n\"Who'll take my bet that my blood turns out to be bluer than his?\"\n\nBut of all these comedies, these tragico-farces of later years, none who\nwere present on that night, when the Vicomte de Marny fought Paul\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, had as yet any presentiment.\n\nThey watched the two men fighting, with the same casual interest, at\nfirst, which they would have bestowed on the dancing of a new movement\nin the minuet.\n\nDe Marny came of a race that had wielded the sword of many centuries,\nbut he was hot, excited, not a little addled with wine and rage.\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de was lucky; he would come out of the affair with a slight\nscratch.\n\nA good swordsman too, that wealthy parvenu. It was interesting to watch\nhis sword-play: very quiet at first, no feint or parry, scarcely a\nriposte, only _en garde,_ always _en garde_ very carefully, steadily,\nready for his antagonist at every turn and in every circumstance.\n\nGradually the circle round the combatants narrowed. A few discreet\nexclamations of admiration greeted D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's most successful parry. De\nMarny was getting more and more excited, the older man more and more\nsober and reserved.\n\nA thoughtless lunge placed the little Vicomte at his opponent's mercy.\nThe next instant he was disarmed, and the seconds were pressing forward\nto end the conflict.\n\nHonour was satisfied: the parvenu and the scion of the ancient race had\ncrossed swords over the reputation of one of the most dissolute women in\nFrance. D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's moderation was a lesson to all the hot-headed young\nbloods who toyed with their lives, their honour, their reputation as\nlightly as they did with their lace-edged handkerchiefs and gold\nsnuff-boxes.\n\nAlready D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had drawn back. With the gentle tact peculiar to\nkindly people, he avoided looking at his disarmed antagonist. But\nsomething in the older man's attitude seemed to further nettle the\nover-stimulated sensibility of the young Vicomte.\n\n\"This is no child's play, monsieur,\" he said excitedly. \"I demand full\nsatisfaction.\"\n\n\"And are you not satisfied?\" queried D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de. \"You have borne yourself\nbravely, you have fought in honour of your liege lady. I, on the other\nhand ...\"\n\n\"You,\" shouted the boy hoarsely, \"you shall publicly apologise to a\nnoble and virtuous woman whom you have outraged--now--at--once--on your\nknees ...\"\n\n\"You are mad, Vicomte,\" rejoined D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de coldly. \"I am willing to ask\nyour forgiveness for my blunder ...\"\n\n\"An apology--in public--on your knees ...\"\n\nThe boy had become more and more excited. He had suffered humiliation\nafter humiliation. He was a mere lad, spoilt, adulated, pampered from\nhis boyhood: the wine had got into his head, the intoxication of rage\nand hatred blinded his saner judgment.\n\n\"Coward!\" he shouted again and again.\n\nHis seconds tried to interpose, but he waved them feverishly aside. He\nwould listen to no one. He saw no one save the man who had insulted\nAd\u00c3\u00a8le, and who was heaping further insults upon her, by refusing this\npublic acknowledgment of her virtues.\n\nDe Marny hated D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de at this moment with the most deadly hatred the\nheart of man can conceive. The older man's calm, his chivalry, his\nconsideration only enhanced the boy's anger and shame.\n\nThe hubbub had become general. Everyone seemed carried away with this\nstrange fever of enmity, which was seething in the Vicomte's veins. Most\nof the young men crowded round De Marny, doing their best to pacify him.\nThe Marquis de Villefranche declared that the matter was getting quite\noutside the rules.\n\nNo one took much notice of D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de. In the remote corners of the\nsaloon a few elderly dandies were laying bets as to the ultimate issue\nof the quarrel.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, however, was beginning to lose his temper. He had no friends\nin that room, and therefore there was no sympathetic observer there, to\nnote the gradual darkening of his eyes, like the gathering of a cloud\nheavy with the coming storm.\n\n\"I pray you, messieurs, let us cease the argument,\" he said at last, in\na loud, impatient voice. \"M. le Vicomte de Marny desires a further\nlesson, and, by God! he shall have it. En garde, M. le Vicomte!\"\n\nThe crowd quickly drew back. The seconds once more assumed the bearing\nand imperturbable expression which their important function demanded.\nThe hubbub ceased as the swords began to clash.\n\nEveryone felt that farce was turning to tragedy.\n\nAnd yet it was obvious from the first that D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de merely meant once\nmore to disarm his antagonist, to give him one more lesson, a little\nmore severe perhaps than the last. He was such a brilliant swordsman, and\nDe Marny was so excited, that the advantage was with him from the very\nfirst.\n\nHow it all happened, nobody afterwards could say. There is no doubt that\nthe little Vicomte's sword-play had become more and more wild: that he\nuncovered himself in the most reckless way, whilst lunging wildly at his\nopponent's breast, until at last, in one of these mad, unguarded\nmoments, he seemed literally to throw himself upon D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's weapon.\n\nThe latter tried with lightning-swift motion of the wrist to avoid the\nfatal issue, but it was too late, and without a sigh or groan, scarce a\ntremor, the Vicomte de Marny fell.\n\nThe sword dropped out of his hand, and it was D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de himself who\ncaught the boy in his arms.\n\nIt had all occurred so quickly and suddenly that no one had realised it\nall, until it was over, and the lad was lying prone on the ground, his\nelegant blue satin coat stained with red, and his antagonist bending\nover him.\n\nThere was nothing more to be done. Etiquette demanded that D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de\nshould withdraw. He was not allowed to do anything for the boy whom he\nhad so unwillingly sent to his death.\n\nAs before, no one took much notice of him. Silence, the awesome silence\ncaused by the presence of the great Master, fell upon all those around.\nOnly in the far corner a shrill voice was heard to say:\n\n\"I hold you at five hundred louis, Marquis. The parvenu is a good\nswordsman.\"\n\nThe groups parted as D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de walked out of the room, followed by the\nColonel and M. de Quettare, who stood by him to the last. Both were old\nand proved soldiers, both had chivalry and courage in them, with which\nto do tribute to the brave man whom they had seconded.\n\nAt the door of the establishment, they met the leech who had been\nsummoned some little time ago to hold himself in readiness for any\neventuality.\n\nThe great eventuality had occurred: it was beyond the leech's learning.\nIn the brilliantly lighted saloon above, the only son of the Duc de\nMarny was breathing his last, whilst D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, wrapping his mantle\nclosely round him, strode out into the dark street, all alone.\n\n\nII\n\nThe head of the house of Marny was at this time barely seventy years of\nage. But he had lived every hour, every minute of his life, from the day\nwhen the Grand Monarque gave him his first appointment as gentleman page\nin waiting when he was a mere lad, barely twelve years of age, to the\nmoment--some ten years ago now--when Nature's relentless hand struck him\ndown in the midst of his pleasures, withered him in a flash as she does\na sturdy old oak, and nailed him--a cripple, almost a dotard--to the\ninvalid chair which he would only quit for his last resting place.\n\nJuliette was then a mere slip of a girl, an old man's child, the spoilt\ndarling of his last happy years. She had retained some of the melancholy\nwhich had characterised her mother, the gentle lady who had endured so\nmuch so patiently, and who had bequeathed this final tender burden--her\nbaby girl--to the brilliant, handsome husband whom she had so deeply\nloved, and so often forgiven.\n\nWhen the Duc de Marny entered the final awesome stage of his gilded\ncareer, that deathlike life which he dragged on for ten years wearily to\nthe grave, Juliette became his only joy, his one gleam of happiness in\nthe midst of torturing memories.\n\nIn her deep, tender eyes he would see mirrored the present, the future\nfor her, and would forget his past, with all its gaieties, its mad,\nmerry years, that meant nothing now but bitter regrets, and endless\nrosary of the might-have-beens.\n\nAnd then there was the boy. The little Vicomte, the future Duc de Marny,\nwho would in _his_ life and with _his_ youth recreate the glory of the\nfamily, and make France once more ring with the echo of brave deeds and\ngallant adventures, which had made the name of Marny so glorious in camp\nand court.\n\nThe Vicomte was not his father's love, but he was his father's pride,\nand from the depths of his huge, cushioned arm-chair, the old man would\nlisten with delight to stories from Versailles and Paris, the young\nQueen and the fascinating Lamballe, the latest play and the newest star\nin the theatrical firmament. His feeble, tottering mind would then take\nhim back, along the paths of memory, to his own youth and his own\ntriumphs, and in the joy and pride in his son, he would forget himself\nfor the sake of the boy.\n\nWhen they brought the Vicomte home that night, Juliette was the first to\nwake. She heard the noise outside the great gates, the coach slowly\ndrawing up, the ring for the doorkeeper, and the sound of Matthieu's\nmutterings, who never liked to be called up in the middle of the night\nto let anyone through the gates.\n\nSomehow a presentiment of evil at once struck the young girl: the\nfootsteps sounded so heavy and muffled along the flagged courtyard, and\nup the great oak staircase. It seemed as if they were carrying something\nheavy, something inert or dead.\n\nShe jumped out of bed and hastily wrapped a cloak round her thin girlish\nshoulders, and slipped her feet into a pair of heelless shoes, then she\nopened her bedroom door and looked out upon the landing.\n\nTwo men, whom she did not know, were walking upstairs abreast, two more\nwere carrying a heavy burden, and Matthieu was behind moaning and crying\nbitterly.\n\nJuliette did not move. She stood in the doorway rigid as a statue. The\nlittle cort\u00c3\u00a8ge went past her. No one saw her, for the landings in the\nHotel de Marny are very wide, and Matthieu's lantern only threw a dim,\nflickering light upon the floor.\n\nThe men stopped outside the Vicomte's room. Matthieu opened it, and then\nthe five men disappeared within, with their heavy burden.\n\nA moment later old P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle, who had been Juliette's nurse, and was\nnow her devoted slave, came to her, all bathed in tears.\n\nShe had just heard the news, and she could scarcely speak, but she\nfolded the young girl, her dear pet lamb, in her arms, and rocking\nherself to and fro she sobbed and eased her aching, motherly heart.\n\nBut Juliette did not cry. It was all so sudden, so awful. She, at\nfourteen years of age, had never dreamed of death; and now there was her\nbrother, her Philippe, in whom she had so much joy, so much pride--he\nwas dead--and her father must be told ...\n\nThe awfulness of this task seemed to Juliette like unto the last\nJudgment Day; a thing so terrible, so appalling, so impossible, that it\nwould take a host of angels to proclaim its inevitableness.\n\nThe old cripple, with one foot in the grave, whose whole feeble mind,\nwhose pride, whose final flicker of hope was concentrated in his boy,\nmust be told that the lad had been brought home dead.\n\n\"Will you tell him, P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle?\" she asked repeatedly, during the brief\nintervals when the violence of the old nurse's grief subsided somewhat.\n\n\"No--no--darling, I cannot--I cannot--\" moaned P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle, amidst a\nrenewed shower of sobs.\n\nJuliette's entire soul--a child's soul it was--rose in revolt at thought\nof what was before her. She felt angered with God for having put such a\nthing upon her. What right had He to demand a girl of her years to\nendure so much mental agony?\n\nTo lose her brother, and to witness her father's grief! She couldn't!\nshe couldn't! she couldn't! God was evil and unjust!\n\nA distant tinkle of a bell made all her nerves suddenly quiver. Her\nfather was awake then? He had heard the noise, and was ringing his bell\nto ask for an explanation of the disturbance.\n\nWith one quick movement Juliette jerked herself free from the nurse's\narms, and before P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle could prevent her, she had run out of the\nroom, straight across the dark landing to a large panelled door\nopposite.\n\nThe old Duc de Marny was sitting on the edge of his bed, with his long,\nthin legs dangling helplessly to the ground.\n\nCrippled as he was, he had struggled to this upright position, he was\nmaking frantic, miserable efforts to raise himself still further. He,\ntoo, had heard the dull thud of feet, the shuffling gait of men when\ncarrying a heavy burden.\n\nHis mind flew back half-a-century, to the days when he had witnessed\nscenes wherein he was then merely a half-interested spectator. He knew\nthe cort\u00c3\u00a8ge composed of valets and friends, with the leech walking\nbeside that precious burden, which anon would be deposited on the bed\nand left to the tender care of a mourning family.\n\nWho knows what pictures were conjured up before that enfeebled vision?\nBut he guessed. And when Juliette dashed into his room and stood before\nhim, pale, trembling, a world of misery in her great eyes, she knew that\nhe guessed and that she need not tell him. God had already done that for\nher.\n\nPierre, the old Duc's devoted valet, dressed him as quickly as he could.\nM. le Duc insisted on having his _habit de c\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a9monie,_ the rich suit of\nblack velvet with the priceless lace and diamond buttons, which he had\nworn when they laid le Roi Soleil to his eternal rest.\n\nHe put on his orders and buckled on his sword. The gorgeous clothes,\nwhich had suited him so well in the prime of his manhood, hung somewhat\nloosely on his attenuated frame, but he looked a grand and imposing\nfigure, with his white hair tied behind with a great black bow, and the\nfine jabot of beautiful point d'Angleterre falling in a soft cascade\nbelow his chin.\n\nThen holding himself as upright as he could, he sat in his invalid\nchair, and four flunkeys in full livery carried him to the deathbed of\nhis son.\n\nAll the house was astir by now. Torches burned in great sockets in the\nvast hall and along the massive oak stairway, and hundreds of candles\nflickered ghostlike in the vast apartments of the princely mansion.\n\nThe numerous servants were arrayed on the landing, all dressed in the\nrich livery of the ducal house.\n\nThe death of an heir of the Marnys is an event that history makes a note\nof.\n\nThe old Duc's chair was placed close to the bed, where lay the dead body\nof the young Vicomte. He made no movement, nor did he utter a word or\nsigh. Some of those who were present at the time declared that his mind\nhad completely given way, and that he neither felt nor understood the\ndeath of his son.\n\nThe Marquis de Villefranche, who had followed his friend to the last,\ntook a final leave of the sorrowing house.\n\nJuliette scarcely noticed him. Her eyes were fixed on her father. She\nwould not look at her brother. A childlike fear had seized her, there,\nsuddenly, between these two silent figures: the living and the dead.\n\nBut just as the Marquis was leaving the room, the old man spoke for the\nfirst time.\n\n\"Marquis,\" he said very quietly, \"you forget--you have not yet told me\nwho killed my son.\"\n\n\"It was in a fair fight, M. de Duc,\" replied the young Marquis, awed in\nspite of all his frivolity, his light-heartedness, by this strange,\nalmost mysterious tragedy.\n\n\"Who killed my son, M. le Marquis?\" repeated the old man mechanically.\n\"I have the right to know,\" he added with sudden, weird energy.\n\n\"It was M. Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, M. le Duc,\" replied the Marquis. \"I repeat,\nit was in fair fight.\"\n\nThe old Duc sighed as if in satisfaction. Then with a courteous gesture\nof farewell reminiscent of the _grand si\u00c3\u00a8cle_ he added:\n\n\"All thanks from me and mine to you, Marquis, would seem but a mockery.\nYour devotion to my son is beyond human thanks. I'll not detain you now.\nFarewell.\"\n\nEscorted by two lacqueys, the Marquis passed out of the room.\n\n\"Dismiss all the servants, Juliette; I have something to say,\" said the\nold Duc, and the young girl, silent, obedient, did as her father bade\nher.\n\nFather and sister were alone with their dead. As soon as the last hushed\nfootsteps of the retreating servants died away in the distance, the Duc\nde Marny seemed to throw away the lethargy which had enveloped him until\nnow. With a quick, feverish gesture he seized his daughter's wrist, and\nmurmured excitedly:\n\n\"His name. You heard his name, Juliette?\"\n\n\"Yes, father,\" replied the child.\n\n\"Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de! Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de! You'll not forget it?\"\n\n\"Never, father!\"\n\n\"He killed your brother! You understand that? Killed my only son, the\nhope of my house, the last descendant of the most glorious race that has\never added lustre to the history of France.\"\n\n\"In fair fight, father!\" protested the child.\n\n\"'Tis not fair for a man to kill a boy,\" retorted the old man, with\nfurious energy.\n\n\"D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de is thirty: my boy was scarce out of his teens: may the\nvengeance of God fall upon the murderer!\"\n\nJuliette, awed, terrified, was gazing at her father with great,\nwondering eyes. He seemed unlike himself. His face wore a curious\nexpression of ecstasy and of hatred, also of hope and exultation,\nwhenever he looked steadily at her.\n\nThat the final glimmer of a tottering reason was fast leaving the poor,\naching head she was too young to realise. Madness was a word that had\nonly a vague meaning for her. Though she did not understand her father\nat the present moment, though she was half afraid of him, she would have\nrejected with scorn and horror any suggestion that he was mad.\n\nTherefore when he took her hand and, drawing her nearer to the bed and\nto himself, placed it upon her dead brother's breast, she recoiled at\nthe touch of the inanimate body, so unlike anything she had ever touched\nbefore, but she obeyed her father without any question, and listened to\nhis words as to those of a sage.\n\n\"Juliette, you are now fourteen, and able to understand what I am going\nto ask of you. If I were not chained to this miserable chair, if I were\nnot a hopeless, abject cripple, I would not depute anyone, not even you,\nmy only child, to do that, which God demands that one of us should do.\"\n\nHe paused a moment, then continued earnestly:\n\n\"Remember, Juliette, that you are of the house of Marny, that you are a\nCatholic, and that God hears you now. For you shall swear an oath before\nHim and me, an oath from which only death can relieve you. Will you\nswear, my child?\"\n\n\"If you wish it, father.\"\n\n\"You have been to confession lately, Juliette?\"\n\n\"Yes, father; also to holy communion, yesterday,\" replied the child. \"It\nwas the F\u00c3\u00aate-Dieu, you know.\"\n\n\"Then you are in a state of grace, my child?\"\n\n\"I was yesterday morning, father,\" replied the young girl na\u00c3\u00afvely, \"but\nI have committed some little sins since then.\"\n\n\"Then make your confession to God in your heart now. You must be in a\nstate of grace when you speak the oath.\"\n\nThe child closed her eyes, and as the old man watched her, he could see\nthe lips framing the words of her spiritual confession.\n\nJuliette made the sign of the cross, then opened her eyes and looked at\nher father.\n\n\"I am ready, father,\" she said; \"I hope God has forgiven me the little\nsins of yesterday.\"\n\n\"Will you swear, my child?\"\n\n\"What, father?\"\n\n\"That you will avenge your brother's death on his murderer?\"\n\n\"But, father ...\"\n\n\"Swear it, my child!\"\n\n\"How can I fulfil that oath, father?--I don't understand ...\"\n\n\"God will guide you, my child. When you are older you will understand.\"\n\nFor a moment Juliette still hesitated. She was just on that borderland\nbetween childhood and womanhood when all the sensibilities, the nervous\nsystem, the emotions, are strung to their highest pitch.\n\nThroughout her short life she had worshipped her father with a\nwhole-hearted, passionate devotion, which had completely blinded her to\nhis weakening faculties and the feebleness of his mind.\n\nShe was also in that initial stage of enthusiastic piety which\noverwhelms every girl of temperament, if she be brought up in the Roman\nCatholic religion, when she is first initiated into the mysteries of the\nSacraments.\n\nJuliette had been to confession and communion. She had been confirmed by\nMonseigneur, the Archbishop. Her ardent nature had responded to the full\nto the sensuous and ecstatic expressions of the ancient faith.\n\nAnd somehow her father's wish, her brother's death, all seemed mingled\nin her brain with that religion, for which in her juvenile enthusiasm\nshe would willingly have laid down her life.\n\nShe thought of all the saints, whose lives she had been reading. Her\nyoung heart quivered at the thought of _their_ sacrifices, their\nmartyrdoms, their sense of duty.\n\nAn exaltation, morbid perhaps, superstitious and overwhelming, took\npossession of her mind; also, perhaps, far back in the innermost\nrecesses of her heart, a pride in her own importance, her mission in\nlife, her individuality: for she was a girl after all, a mere child,\nabout to become a woman.\n\nBut the old Duc was waxing impatient.\n\n\"Surely you do not hesitate, Juliette, with your dead brother's body\nclamouring mutely for revenge? You, the only Marny left now!--for from\nthis day I too shall be as dead.\"\n\n\"No, father,\" said the young girl in an awed whisper, \"I do not\nhesitate. I will swear, just as you bid me.\"\n\n\"Repeat the words after me, my child.\"\n\n\"Yes, father.\"\n\n\"Before the face of Almighty God, who sees and hears me ...\"\n\n\"Before the face of Almighty God, who sees and hears me,\" repeated\nJuliette firmly.\n\n\"I swear that I will seek out Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de.\"\n\n\"I swear that I will seek out Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de.\"\n\n\"And in any manner which God may dictate to me encompass his death, his\nruin or dishonour, in revenge for my brother's death.\"\n\n\"And in any manner which God may dictate to me encompass his death, his\nruin or dishonour, in revenge for my brother's death,\" said Juliette\nsolemnly.\n\n\"May my brother's soul remain in torment until the final Judgment Day if\nI should break my oath, but may it rest in eternal peace the day on\nwhich his death is fitly avenged.\"\n\n\"May my brother's soul remain in torment until the final Judgment Day if\nI should break my oath, but may it rest in eternal peace the day on\nwhich his death is fitly avenged.\"\n\nThe child fell upon her knees. The oath was spoken, the old man was\nsatisfied.\n\nHe called for his valet, and allowed himself quietly to be put to bed.\n\nOne brief hour had transformed a child into a woman. A dangerous\ntransformation when the brain is overburdened with emotions, when the\nnerves are overstrung and the heart full to breaking.\n\nFor the moment, however, the childlike nature reasserted itself for the\nlast time, for Juliette, sobbing, had fled out of the room, to the\nprivacy of her own apartment, and thrown herself passionately into the\narms of kind old P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nParis: 1793\n\nThe outrage.\n\n\nIt would have been very difficult to say why Citizen D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de was quite\nso popular as he was. Still more difficult would it have been to state\nthe reason why he remained immune from the prosecutions, which were\nbeing conducted at the rate of several scores a day, now against the\nmoderate Gironde, anon against the fanatic Mountain, until the whole of\nFrance was transformed into one gigantic prison, that daily fed the\nguillotine.\n\nBut D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de remained unscathed. Even Merlin's law of the suspect had\nso far failed to touch him. And when, last July, the murder of Marat\nbrought an entire holocaust of victims to the guillotine--from Adam Lux,\nwho would have put up a statue in honour of Charlotte Corday, with the\ninscription: \"Greater than Brutus\", to Charlier, who would have had her\npublicly tortured and burned at the stake for her crime--D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de alone\nsaid nothing, and was allowed to remain silent.\n\nThe most seething time of that seething revolution. No one knew in the\nmorning if his head would still be on his own shoulders in the evening,\nor if it would be held up by Citizen Samson the headsman, for the\nsansculottes of Paris to see.\n\nYet D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de was allowed to go his own way. Marat once said of him: \"Il\nn'est pas dangereux.\" The phrase had been taken up. Within the precincts\nof the National Convention, Marat was still looked upon as the great\nprotagonist of Liberty, a martyr to his own convictions carried to the\nextreme, to squalor and dirt, to the downward levelling of man to what\nis the lowest type in humanity. And his sayings were still treasured up:\neven the Girondins did not dare to attack his memory. Dead Marat was\nmore powerful than his living presentment had been.\n\nAnd he had said that D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de was not dangerous. Not dangerous to\nRepublicanism, to liberty, to that downward, levelling process, the\ntearing down of old traditions, and the annihilation of past\npretensions.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had once been very rich. He had had sufficient prudence to\ngive away in good time that which, undoubtedly, would have been taken\naway from him later on.\n\nBut when he gave willingly, at a time when France needed it most, and\nbefore she had learned how to help herself to what she wanted.\n\nAnd somehow, in this instance, France had not forgotten: an invisible\nfortress seemed to surround Citizen D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and keep his enemies at\nbay. They were few, but they existed. The National Convention trusted\nhim. \"He was not dangerous\" to them. The people looked upon him as one\nof themselves, who gave whilst he had something to give. Who can gauge\nthat most elusive of all things: _Popularity?_\n\nHe lived a quiet life, and had never yielded to the omni-prevalent\ntemptation of writing pamphlets, but lived alone with his mother and\nAnne Mie, the little orphaned cousin whom old Madame D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had taken\ncare of, ever since the child could toddle.\n\nEveryone knew his house in the Rue Ecole de M\u00c3\u00a9decine, not far from the\none wherein Marat lived and died, the only solid, stone house in the\nmidst of a row of hovels, evil-smelling and squalid.\n\nThe street was narrow then, as it is now, and whilst Paris was cutting\noff the heads of her children for the sake of Liberty and Fraternity,\nshe had no time to bother about cleanliness and sanitation.\n\nRue Ecole de M\u00c3\u00a9decine did little credit to the school after which it was\nnamed, and it was a most unattractive crowd that usually thronged its\nuneven, muddy pavements.\n\nA neat gown, a clean kerchief, were quite an unusual sight down this\nway, for Anne Mie seldom went out, and old Madame D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de hardly ever\nleft her room. A good deal of brandy was being drunk at the two drinking\nbars, one at each end of the long, narrow street, and by five o'clock in\nthe afternoon it was undoubtedly best for women to remain indoors.\n\nThe crowd of dishevelled elderly Amazons who stood gossiping at the\nstreet corner could hardly be called women now. A ragged petticoat, a\ngreasy red kerchief round the head, a tattered, stained shift--to this\npass of squalor and shame had Liberty brought the daughters of France.\n\nAnd they jeered at any passer-by less filthy, less degraded than\nthemselves.\n\n\"Ah! voyons l'aristo!\" they shouted every time a man in decent clothes,\na woman with tidy cap and apron, passed swiftly down the street.\n\nAnd the afternoons were very lively. There was always plenty to see:\nfirst and foremost, the long procession of tumbrils, winding its way\nfrom the prisons to the Place de la R\u00c3\u00a9volution. The forty-four thousand\nsections of the Committee of Public Safety sent their quota, each in\ntheir turn, to the guillotine.\n\nAt one time these tumbrils contained royal ladies and gentlemen,\n_ci-devant_ dukes and princesses, aristocrats from every county in\nFrance, but now this stock was becoming exhausted. The wretched Queen\nMarie Antoinette still lingered in the Temple with her son and daughter.\nMadame Elisabeth was still allowed to say her prayers in peace, but\n_ci-devant_ dukes and counts were getting scarce: those who had not\nperished at the hand of Citizen Samson were plying some trade in Germany\nor England.\n\nThere were aristocratic joiners, innkeepers, and hairdressers. The\nproudest names in France were hidden beneath trade signs in London and\nHamburg. A good number owed their lives to that mysterious Scarlet\nPimpernel, that unknown Englishman who had snatched scores of victims\nfrom the clutches of Tinville the Prosecutor, and sent M. Chauvelin,\nbaffled, back to France.\n\nAristocrats were getting scarce, so it was now the turn of deputies of\nthe National Convention, of men of letters, men of science or of art,\nmen who had sent others to the guillotine a twelvemonth ago, and men who\nhad been loudest in defence of anarchy and its Reign of Terror.\n\nThey had revolutionised the Calendar: the Citizen-Deputies, and every\ngood citizen of France, called this 19th day of August 1793 the 2nd\nFructidor of the year I. of the New Era.\n\nAt six o'clock on that afternoon a young girl suddenly turned the angle\nof the Rue Ecole de M\u00c3\u00a9decine, and after looking quickly to the right and\nleft she began deliberately walking along the narrow street.\n\nIt was crowded just then. Groups of excited women stood jabbering before\nevery doorway. It was the home-coming hour after the usual spectacle on\nthe Place de la R\u00c3\u00a9volution. The men had paused at the various drinking\nbooths, crowding the women out. It would be the turn of these Amazons\nnext, at the brandy bars; for the moment they were left to gossip, and\nto jeer at the passer-by.\n\nAt first the young girl did not seem to heed them. She walked quickly\nalong, looking defiantly before her, carrying her head erect, and\nstepping carefully from cobblestone to cobblestone, avoiding the mud,\nwhich could have dirtied her dainty shoes.\n\nThe harridans passed the time of day to her, and the time of day meant\nsome obscene remark unfit for women's ears. The young girl wore a simple\ngrey dress, with fine lawn kerchief neatly folded across her bosom, a\nlarge hat with flowing ribbons sat above the fairest face that ever\ngladdened men's eyes to see.\n\nFairer still it would have been, but for the look of determination which\nmade it seem hard and old for the girl's years.\n\nShe wore the tricolour scarf round her waist, else she had been more\nseriously molested ere now. But the Republican colours were her\nsafeguard: whilst she walked quietly along, no one could harm her.\n\nThen suddenly a curious impulse seemed to seize her. It was just outside\nthe large stone house belonging to Citizen-Deputy D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de. She had so\nfar taken no notice of the groups of women which she had come across.\nWhen they obstructed the footway, she had calmly stepped out into the\nmiddle of the road.\n\nIt was wise and prudent, for she could close her ears to obscene\nlanguage and need pay no heed to insult.\n\nSuddenly she threw up her head defiantly.\n\n\"Will you please let me pass?\" she said loudly, as a dishevelled Amazon\nstood before her with arms akimbo, glancing sarcastically at the lace\npetticoat, which just peeped beneath the young girl's simple grey frock.\n\n\"Let her pass? Let her pass? Ho! ho! ho!\" laughed the old woman, turning\nto the nearest group of idlers, and apostrophising them with a loud\noath. \"Did _you_ know, citizeness, that this street had been specially\nmade for aristos to pass along?\"\n\n\"I am in a hurry, will you let me pass at once?\" commanded the young\ngirl, tapping her foot impatiently on the ground.\n\nThere was the whole width of the street on her right, plenty of room for\nher to walk along. It seemed positive madness to provoke a quarrel\nsinglehanded against this noisy group of excited females, just home from\nthe ghastly spectacle around the guillotine.\n\nAnd yet she seemed to do it wilfully, as if coming to the end of her\npatience, all her proud, aristocratic blood in revolt against this\nevil-smelling crowd which surrounded her.\n\nHalf-tipsy men and noisome, naked urchins seemed to have sprung from\neverywhere.\n\n\"Oho, quelle aristo!\" they shouted with ironical astonishment, gazing at\nthe young girl's face, fingering her gown, thrusting begrimed,\nhate-distorted faces close to her own.\n\nInstinctively she recoiled and backed towards the house immediately on\nher left. It was adorned with a porch made of stout oak beams, with a\ntiled roof; an iron lantern descended from this, and there was a stone\nparapet below, and a few steps, at right angles from the pavement, led\nup to the massive door.\n\nOn these steps the young girl had taken refuge. Proud, defiant, she\nconfronted the howling mob, which she had so wilfully provoked.\n\n\"Of a truth, Citizeness Margot, that grey dress would become you well!\"\nsuggested a young man, whose red cap hung in tatters over an evil and\ndissolute-looking face.\n\n\"And all that fine lace would make a splendid jabot round the aristo's\nneck when Citizen Samson holds up her head for us to see,\" added\nanother, as with mock elegance he stooped and with two very grimy\nfingers slightly raised the young girl's grey frock, displaying the\nlace-edged petticoat beneath.\n\nA volley of oaths and loud, ironical laughter greeted this sally.\n\n\"'Tis mighty fine lace to be thus hidden away,\" commented an elderly\nharridan. \"Now, would you believe it, my fine madam, but my legs are\nbare underneath my kirtle?\"\n\n\"And dirty, too, I'll lay a wager,\" laughed another. \"Soap is dear in\nParis just now.\"\n\n\"The lace on the aristo's kerchief would pay the baker's bill of a whole\nfamily for a month!\" shouted an excited voice.\n\nHeat and brandy further addled the brains of this group of French\ncitizens; hatred gleamed out of every eye. Outrage was imminent. The\nyoung girl seemed to know it, but she remained defiant and\nself-possessed, gradually stepping back and back up the steps, closely\nfollowed by her assailants.\n\n\"To the Jew with the gewgaw, then!\" shouted a thin, haggard female\nviciously, as she suddenly clutched at the young girl's kerchief, and\nwith a mocking, triumphant laugh tore it from her bosom.\n\nThis outrage seemed to be the signal for the breaking down of the final\nbarriers which ordinary decency should have raised. The language and\nvituperation became such as no chronicler could record.\n\nThe girl's dainty white neck, her clear skin, the refined contour of\nshoulders and bust, seemed to have aroused the deadliest lust of hate in\nthese wretched creatures, rendered bestial by famine and squalor.\n\nIt seemed almost as if one would vie with the other in seeking for words\nwhich would most offend these small aristocratic ears.\n\nThe young girl was now crouching against the doorway, her hands held up\nto her ears to shut out the awful sounds. She did not seem frightened,\nonly appalled at the terrible volcano which she had provoked.\n\nSuddenly a miserable harridan struck her straight in the face, with\nhard, grimy fist, and a long shout of exultation greeted this monstrous\ndeed.\n\nThen only did the girl seem to lose her self-control.\n\n\"A moi,\" she shouted loudly, whilst hammering with both hands against\nthe massive doorway. \"A moi! Murder! Murder! Citoyen D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, \u00c3\u00a0 moi!\"\n\nBut her terror was greeted with renewed glee by her assailants. They\nwere now roused to the highest point of frenzy: the crowd of brutes\nwould in the next moment have torn the helpless girl from her place of\nrefuge and dragged her into the mire, an outraged prey, for the\nsatisfaction of an ungovernable hate.\n\nBut just as half-a-dozen pairs of talon-like hands clutched frantically\nat her skirts, the door behind her was quickly opened. She felt her arm\nseized firmly, and herself dragged swiftly within the shelter of the\nthreshold.\n\nHer senses, overwrought by the terrible adventure which she had just\ngone through, were threatening to reel; she heard the massive door\nclose, shutting out the yells of baffled rage, the ironical laughter,\nthe obscene words, which sounded in her ears like the shrieks of Dante's\ndamned.\n\nShe could not see her rescuer, for the hall into which he had hastily\ndragged her was only dimly lighted. But a peremptory voice said quickly:\n\n\"Up the stairs, the room straight in front of you, my mother is there.\nGo quickly.\"\n\nShe had fallen on her knees, cowering against the heavy oak beam which\nsupported the ceiling, and was straining her eyes to catch sight of the\nman, to whom at this moment she perhaps owed more than her life: but he\nwas standing against the doorway, with his hand on the latch.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" she murmured.\n\n\"Prevent their breaking into my house in order to drag you out of it,\"\nhe replied quietly; \"so, I pray you, do as I bid you.\"\n\nMechanically she obeyed him, drew herself to her feet, and, turning\ntowards the stairs, began slowly to mount the shallow steps. Her knees\nwere shaking under her, her whole body was trembling with horror at the\nawesome crisis she had just traversed.\n\nShe dared not look back at her rescuer. Her head was bent, and her lips\nwere murmuring half-audible words as she went.\n\nOutside the hooting and yelling was becoming louder and louder. Enraged\nfists were hammering violently against the stout oak door.\n\nAt the top of the stairs, moved by an irresistible impulse, she turned\nand looked into the hall.\n\nShe saw his figure dimly outlined in the gloom, one hand on the latch,\nhis head thrown back to watch her movements.\n\nA door stood ajar immediately in front of her. She pushed it open and\nwent within.\n\nAt that moment he too opened the door below. The shrieks of the howling\nmob once more resounded close to her ears. It seemed as if they had\nsurrounded him. She wondered what was happening, and marvelled how he\ndared to face that awful crowd alone.\n\nThe room into which she had entered was gay and cheerful-looking with\nits dainty chintz hangings and graceful, elegant pieces of furniture.\nThe young girl looked up, as a kindly voice said to her, from out the\ndepths of a capacious armchair:\n\n\"Come in, come in, my dear, and close the door behind you! Did those\nwretches attack you? Never mind. Paul will speak to them. Come here, my\ndear, and sit down; there's no cause now for fear.\"\n\nWithout a word the young girl came forward. She seemed now to be walking\nin a dream, the chintz hangings to be swaying ghostlike around her, the\nyells and shrieks below to come from the very bowels of the earth.\n\nThe old lady continued to prattle on. She had taken the girl's hand in\nhers, and was gently forcing her down on to a low stool beside her\narmchair. She was talking about Paul, and said something about Anne Mie,\nand then about the National Convention, and those beasts and savages,\nbut mostly about Paul.\n\nThe noise outside had subsided. The girl felt strangely sick and tired.\nHer head seemed to be whirling round, the furniture to be dancing round\nher; the old lady's face looked at her through a swaying veil, and\nthen--and then ...\n\nTired Nature was having her way at last; she folded the quivering young\nbody in her motherly arms, and wrapped the aching senses beneath her\nmerciful mantle of unconsciousness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nCitizen-Deputy.\n\n\nWhen, presently, the young girl awoke, with a delicious feeling of rest\nand well-being, she had plenty of leisure to think.\n\nSo, then, this was his house! She was actually a guest, a rescued\nprot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9, beneath the roof of Citoyen D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de.\n\nHe had dragged her from the clutches of the howling mob which she had\nprovoked; his mother had made her welcome, a sweet-faced, young girl\nscarce out of her teens, sad-eyed and slightly deformed, had waited upon\nher and made her happy and comfortable.\n\nJuliette de Marny was in the house of the man, whom she had sworn before\nher God and before her father to pursue with hatred and revenge.\n\nTen years had gone by since then.\n\nLying upon the sweet-scented bed which the hospitality of the D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8des\nhad provided for her, she seemed to see passing before her the spectres\nof these past ten years--the first four, after her brother's death,\nuntil the old Duc de Marny's body slowly followed his soul to its grave.\n\nAfter that last glimmer of life beside the deathbed of his son, the old\nDuc had practically ceased to be. A mute, shrunken figure, he merely\nexisted; his mind vanished, his memory gone, a wreck whom Nature\nfortunately remembered at last, and finally took away from the invalid\nchair which had been his world.\n\nThen came those few years at the Convent of the Ursulines. Juliette had\nhoped that she had a vocation; her whole soul yearned for a secluded, a\nreligious, life, for great barriers of solemn vows and days spent in\nprayer and contemplation, to interpose between herself and the memory of\nthat awful night when, obedient to her father's will, she had made the\nsolemn oath to avenge her brother's death.\n\nShe was only eighteen when she first entered the convent, directly after\nher father's death, when she felt very lonely--both morally and mentally\nlonely--and followed by the obsession of that oath.\n\nShe never spoke of it to anyone except to her confessor, and he, a\nsimple-minded man of great learning and a total lack of knowledge of the\nworld, was completely at a loss how to advise.\n\nThe Archbishop was consulted. He could grant a dispensation, and release\nher of that most solemn vow.\n\nWhen first this idea was suggested to her, Juliette was exultant. Her\nentire nature, which in itself was wholesome, light-hearted, the very\nreverse of morbid, rebelled against this unnatural task placed upon her\nyoung shoulders. It was only religion--the strange, warped religion of\nthat extraordinary age--which kept her to it, which forbade her breaking\nlightly that most unnatural oath.\n\nThe Archbishop was a man of many duties, many engagements. He agreed to\ngive this strange \"cas de conscience\" his most earnest attention. He\nwould make no promises. But Mademoiselle de Marny was rich: a munificent\ndonation to the poor of Paris, or to some cause dear to the Holy Father\nhimself, might perhaps be more acceptable to God than the fulfilment of\na compulsory vow.\n\nJuliette, within the convent walls, was waiting patiently for the\nArchbishop's decision at the very moment, when the greatest upheaval the\nworld has ever known was beginning to shake the very foundations of\nFrance.\n\nThe Archbishop had other things now to think about than isolated cases\nof conscience. He forgot all about Juliette, probably. He was busy\nconsoling a monarch for the loss of his throne, and preparing himself\nand his royal patron for the scaffold.\n\nThe Convent of the Ursulines was scattered during the Terror. Everyone\nremembers the Thermidor massacres, and the thirty-four nuns, all\ndaughters of ancient families of France, who went so cheerfully to the\nscaffold.\n\nJuliette was one of those who escaped condemnation. How or why, she\nherself could not have told. She was very young, and still a postulant;\nshe was allowed to live in retirement with P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle, her old nurse,\nwho had remained faithful through all these years.\n\nThen the Archbishop was prosecuted and imprisoned. Juliette made frantic\nefforts to see him, but all in vain. When he died, she looked upon her\nspiritual guide's death as a direct warning from God, that nothing could\nrelieve her of her oath.\n\nShe had watched the turmoils of the Revolution through the attic window\nof her tiny apartment in Paris. Waited upon by faithful P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle, she\nhad been forced to live on the savings of that worthy old soul, as all\nher property, all the Marny estates, the _dot_ she took with her to the\nconvent--everything, in fact--had been seized by the Revolutionary\nGovernment, self appointed to level fortunes, as well as individuals.\n\nFrom that attic window she had seen beautiful Paris writhing under the\npitiless lash of the demon of terror which it had provoked; she had\nheard the rumble of the tumbrils, dragging day after day their load of\nvictims to the insatiable maker of this Revolution of Fraternity--the\nGuillotine.\n\nShe had seen the gay, light-hearted people of this Star-City turned to\nhowling beasts of prey, its women changed to sexless vultures, with\nmurderous talons implanted in everything that is noble, high or\nbeautiful.\n\nShe was not twenty when the feeble, vacillating monarch and his\nimperious consort were dragged back--a pair of humiliated prisoners--to\nthe capital from which they had tried to flee.\n\nTwo years later, she had heard the cries of an entire people exulting\nover a regicide. Then the murder of Marat, by a young girl like herself,\nthe pale-faced, large-eyed Charlotte, who had committed a crime for the\nsake of a conviction. \"Greater than Brutus!\" some had called her.\nGreater than Joan of Arc, for it was to a mission of evil and of sin\nthat she was called from the depths of her Breton village, and not to\none of glory and triumph.\n\n\"Greater than Brutus!\"\n\nJuliette followed the trial of Charlotte Corday with all the passionate\nardour of her exalted temperament.\n\nJust think what an effect it must have had upon the mind of this young\ngirl, who for nine years--the best of her life--had also lived with the\nidea of a sublime mission pervading her very soul.\n\nShe watched Charlotte Corday at her trial. Conquering her natural\nrepulsion for such scenes, and the crowds which usually watched them,\nshe had forced her way into the foremost rank of the narrow gallery\nwhich overlooked the Hall of the Revolutionary Tribunal.\n\nShe heard the indictment, heard Tinville's speech and the calling of the\nwitnesses.\n\n\"All this is unnecessary. I killed Marat!\"\n\nJuliette heard the fresh young voice ringing out clearly above the\nmurmur of voices, the howls of execration; she saw the beautiful young\nface, clear, calm, impassive.\n\n\"I killed Marat!\"\n\nAnd there in the special space allotted to the Citizen-Deputies, sitting\namong those who represented the party of the Moderate Gironde, was Paul\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, the man whom she had sworn to pursue with a vengeance as\ngreat, as complete, as that which guided Charlotte Corday's hand.\n\nShe watched him during the trial, and wondered if he had any\npresentiment of the hatred which dogged him, like unto the one which had\ndogged Marat.\n\nHe was very dark, almost swarthy a son of the South, with brown hair,\nfree from powder, thrown back and revealing the brow of a student rather\nthan that of a legislator. He watched Charlotte Corday earnestly, and\nJuliette who watched him saw the look of measureless pity, which\nsoftened the otherwise hard look of his close-set eyes.\n\nHe made an impassioned speech for the defence: a speech which has become\nhistoric. It would have cost any other man his head.\n\nJuliette marvelled at his courage; to defend Charlotte Corday was\nequivalent to acquiescing in the death of Marat: Marat, the friend of\nthe people; Marat, whom his funeral orators had compared to the Great,\nthe Sacred Leveller of Mankind!\n\nBut D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's speech was not a defence, it was an appeal. The most\neloquent man of that eloquent age, his words seemed to find that hidden\nbit of sentiment which still lurked in the hearts of these strange\nprotagonists of Hate.\n\nEveryone round Juliette listened as he spoke: \"It is Citoyen D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de!\"\nwhispered the bloodthirsty Amazons, who sat knitting in the gallery.\n\nBut there was no further comment. A huge, magnificently-equipped\nhospital for sick children had been thrown open in Paris that very\nmorning, a gift to the nation from Citoyen D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de. Surely he was\nprivileged to talk a little, if it pleased him. His hospital would cover\nquite a good many defalcations.\n\nEven the rabid Mountain, Danton, Merlin, Santerre, shrugged their\nshoulders. \"It is D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, let him talk an he list. Murdered Marat\nsaid of him that he was not dangerous.\"\n\nJuliette heard it all. The knitters round her were talking loudly. Even\nCharlotte was almost forgotten whilst D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de talked. He had a fine\nvoice, of strong calibre, which echoed powerfully through the hall.\n\nHe was rather short, but broad-shouldered and well knit, with an\nexpressive hand, which looked slender and delicate below the fine lace\nruffle.\n\nCharlotte Corday was condemned. All D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's eloquence could not save\nher.\n\nJuliette left the court in a state of mad exultation. She was very\nyoung: the scenes she had witnessed in the past two years could not help\nbut excite the imagination of a young girl, left entirely to her own\nintellectual and moral resources.\n\nWhat scenes! Great God!\n\nAnd now to wait for an opportunity! Charlotte Corday, the half-educated\nlittle provincial should not put to shame Mademoiselle de Marny, the\ndaughter of a hundred dukes, of those who had made France before she\ntook to unmaking herself.\n\nBut she could not formulate any definite plans. P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle, poor old\nsoul, her only confidante, was not of the stuff that heroines are made\nof. Juliette felt impelled by duty, and duty at best is not so prompt a\ncounsellor as love or hate.\n\nHer adventure outside D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's house had not been premeditated.\nImpulse and coincidence had worked their will with her.\n\nShe had been in the habit, daily, for the past month, of wandering down\nthe Rue Ecole de M\u00c3\u00a9decine, ostensibly to gaze at Marat's dwelling, as\ncrowds of idlers were wont to do, but really in order to look at\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's house. Once or twice she saw him coming or going from home.\nOnce she caught sight of the inner hall, and of a young girl in a dark\nkirtle and snow-white kerchief bidding him good-bye at his door. Another\ntime she caught sight of him at the corner of the street, helping that\nsame young girl over the muddy pavement. He had just met her, and she\nwas carrying a basket of provisions: he took it from her and carried it\nto the house.\n\nChivalrous--eh?--and innately so, evidently, for the girl was slightly\ndeformed: hardly a hunchback, but weak and unattractive-looking, with\nmelancholy eyes, and a pale, pinched face.\n\nIt was the thought of that little act of simple chivalry, witnessed the\nday before, which caused Juliette to provoke the scene which, but for\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's timely interference, might have ended so fatally. But she\nreckoned on that interference: the whole thing had occurred to her\nsuddenly, and she had carried it through.\n\nHad not her father said to her that when the time came, God would show\nher a means to the end?\n\nAnd now she was inside the house of the man who had murdered her brother\nand sent her sorrowing father, a poor, senseless maniac, tottering to\nthe grave.\n\nWould God's finger point again, and show her what to do next, how best\nto accomplish what she had sworn to do?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nHospitality.\n\n\n\"Is there anything more I can do for you now, mademoiselle?\"\n\nThe gentle, timid voice roused Juliette from the contemplation of the\npast.\n\nShe smiled at Anne Mie, and held her hand out towards her.\n\n\"You have all been so kind,\" she said, \"I want to get up now and thank\nyou all.\"\n\n\"Don't move unless you feel quite well.\"\n\n\"I am quite well now. Those horrid people frightened me so, that is why\nI fainted.\"\n\n\"They would have half-killed you, if ...\"\n\n\"Will you tell me where I am?\" asked Juliette.\n\n\"In the house of M. Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de--I should have said of Citizen-Deputy\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de. He rescued you from the mob, and pacified them. He has such a\nbeautiful voice that he can make anyone listen to him, and ...\"\n\n\"And you are fond of him, mademoiselle?\" added Juliette, suddenly\nfeeling a mist of tears rising to her eyes.\n\n\"Of course I am fond of him,\" rejoined the other girl simply, whilst a\nlook of the most tender-hearted devotion seemed to beautify her pale\nface. \"He and Madame D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de have brought me up; I never knew my\nparents. They have cared for me, and he has taught me all I know.\"\n\n\"What do they call you, mademoiselle?\"\n\n\"My name is Anne Mie.\"\n\n\"And mine, Juliette--Juliette Marny,\" she added after a slight\nhesitation. \"I have no parents either. My old nurse, P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle, has\nbrought me up, and--But tell me more about M. D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de--I owe him so\nmuch, I'd like to know him better.\"\n\n\"Will you not let me arrange your hair?\" said Anne Mie as if purposely\nevading a direct reply. \"M. D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de is in the salon with madame. You\ncan see him then.\"\n\nJuliette asked no more questions, but allowed Anne Mie to tidy her hair\nfor her, to lend her a fresh kerchief and generally to efface all traces\nof her terrible adventure. She felt puzzled and tearful. Anne Mie's\ngentleness seemed somehow to jar on her spirits. She could not\nunderstand the girl's position in the D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de household. Was she a\nrelative, or a superior servant? In these troublous times she might\neasily have been both.\n\nIn any case she was a childhood's companion of the\nCitizen-Deputy--whether on an equal or a humbler footing, Juliette would\nhave given much to ascertain.\n\nWith the marvellous instinct peculiar to women of temperament, she had\nalready divined Anne Mie's love for D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de. The poor young cripple's\nvery soul seemed to quiver magnetically at the bare mention of his name,\nher whole face became transfigured: Juliette even thought her beautiful\nthen.\n\nShe looked at herself critically in the glass, and adjusted a curl,\nwhich looked its best when it was rebellious. She scrutinised her own\nface carefully; why? she could not tell: another of those subtle\nfeminine instincts perhaps.\n\nThe becoming simplicity of the prevailing mode suited her to perfection.\nThe waist line, rather high but clearly defined--a precursor of the\nlater more accentuated fashion--gave grace to her long slender limbs,\nand emphasised the lissomeness of her figure. The kerchief, edged with\nfine lace, and neatly folded across her bosom, softened the contour of\nher girlish bust and shoulders.\n\nAnd her hair was a veritable glory round her dainty, piquant face. Soft,\nfair, and curly, it emerged in a golden halo from beneath the prettiest\nlittle lace cap imaginable.\n\nShe turned and faced Anne Mie, ready to follow her out of the room, and\nthe young crippled girl sighed as she smoothed down the folds of her own\napron, and gave a final touch to the completion of Juliette's attire.\n\nThe time before the evening meal slipped by like a dream-hour for\nJuliette.\n\nShe had lived so much alone, had led such an introspective life, that\nshe had hardly realised and understood all that was going on around her.\nAt the time when the inner vitality of France first asserted itself and\nthen swept away all that hindered its mad progress, she was tied to the\ninvalid chair of her half-demented father; then, after that, the\nsheltering walls of the Ursuline Convent had hidden from her mental\nvision the true meaning of the great conflict, between the Old Era and\nthe New.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de was neither a pedant nor yet a revolutionary: his theories\nwere Utopian and he had an extraordinary overpowering sympathy for his\nfellow-men.\n\nAfter the first casual greetings with Juliette, he had continued a\ndiscussion with his mother, which the young girl's entrance had\ninterrupted.\n\nHe seemed to take but little notice of her, although at times his dark,\nkeen eyes would seek hers, as if challenging her for a reply.\n\nHe was talking of the mob of Paris, whom he evidently understood so\nwell. Incidents such as the one which Juliette had provoked, had led to\nrape and theft, often to murder, before now: but outside Citizen-Deputy\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's house everything was quiet, half-an-hour after Juliette's\nescape from that howling, brutish crowd.\n\nHe had merely spoken to them, for about twenty minutes, and they had\ngone away quite quietly, without even touching one hair of his head. He\nseemed to love them: to know how to separate the little good that was in\nthem, from that hard crust of evil, which misery had put around their\nhearts.\n\nOnce he addressed Juliette somewhat abruptly: \"Pardon me, mademoiselle,\nbut for your own sake we must guard you a prisoner here awhile. No one\nwould harm you under this roof, but it would not be safe for you to\ncross the neighbouring streets to-night.\"\n\n\"But I must go, monsieur. Indeed, indeed I must!\" she said earnestly. \"I\nam deeply grateful to you, but I could not leave P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle.\"\n\n\"Who is P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle?\"\n\n\"My dear old nurse, monsieur. She has never left me. Think how anxious\nand miserable she must be, at my prolonged absence.\"\n\n\"Where does she live?\"\n\n\"At No. 15 Rue Taitbout, but ...\"\n\n\"Will you allow me to take her a message?--telling her that you are safe\nand under my roof, where it is obviously more prudent that you should\nremain at present.\"\n\n\"If you think it best, monsieur,\" she replied.\n\nInwardly she was trembling with excitement. God had not only brought her\nto this house, but willed that she should stay in it.\n\n\"In whose name shall I take the message, mademoiselle?\" he asked.\n\n\"My name is Juliette Marny.\"\n\nShe watched him keenly as she said it, but there was not the slightest\nsign in his expressive face, to show that he had recognised the name.\n\nTen years is a long time, and every one had lived through so much during\nthose years! A wave of intense wrath swept through Juliette's soul, as\nshe realised that he had forgotten. The name meant nothing to him! It\ndid not recall to him the fact that his hand was stained with blood.\nDuring ten years she had suffered, she had fought with herself, fought\nfor him as it were, against the Fate which she was destined to mete out\nto him, whilst he had forgotten, or at least had ceased to think.\n\nHe bowed to her and went out of the room.\n\nThe wave of wrath subsided, and she was left alone with Madame\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de: presently Anne Mie came in.\n\nThe three women chatted together, waiting for the return of the master\nof the house. Juliette felt well and, in spite of herself, almost happy.\nShe had lived so long in the miserable, little attic alone with\nP\u00c3\u00a9tronelle that she enjoyed the well-being of this refined home. It was\nnot so grand or gorgeous of course as her father's princely palace\nopposite the Louvre, a wreck now, since it was annexed by the Committee\nof National Defence, for the housing of soldiery. But the D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8des'\nhome was essentially a refined one. The delicate china on the tall\nchimney-piece, the few bits of Buhl and Vernis Martin about the room,\nthe vision through the open doorway of the supper-table spread with a\nfine white cloth, and sparkling with silver, all spoke of fastidious\ntastes, of habits of luxury and elegance, which the spirit of Equality\nand Anarchy had not succeeded in eradicating.\n\nWhen D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de came back, he brought an atmosphere of breezy\ncheerfulness with him.\n\nThe street was quiet now, and when walking past the hospital--his own\ngift to the Nation--he had been loudly cheered. One or two ironical\nvoices had asked him what he had done with the aristo and her lace\nfurbelows, but it remained at that and Mademoiselle Marny need have no\nfear.\n\nHe had brought P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle along with him: his careless, lavish\nhospitality would have suggested the housing of Juliette's entire\ndomestic establishment, had she possessed one.\n\nAs it was, the worthy old soul's deluge of happy tears had melted his\nkindly heart. He offered her and her young mistress shelter, until the\nsmall cloud should have rolled by.\n\nAfter that he suggested a journey to England. Emigration now was the\nonly real safety, and Mademoiselle Marny had unpleasantly drawn on\nherself the attention of the Paris rabble. No doubt, within the next few\ndays her name would figure among the \"suspect.\" She would be safest out\nof the country, and could not do better than place herself under the\nguidance of that English enthusiast, who had helped so many persecuted\nFrenchmen to escape from the terrors of the Revolution: the man who was\nsuch a thorn in the flesh of the Committee of Public Safety, and who\nwent by the nickname of The Scarlet Pimpernel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThe faithful house-dog.\n\n\nAfter supper they talked of Charlotte Corday.\n\nJuliette clung to the vision of that heroine, and liked to talk of her.\nShe appeared as a justification of her own actions, which somehow seemed\nto require justification.\n\nShe loved to hear Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de talk; liked to provoke his enthusiasm\nand to see his stern, dark face light up with the inward fire of the\nenthusiast.\n\nShe had openly avowed herself as the daughter of the Duc de Marny. When\nshe actually named her father, and her brother killed in duel, she saw\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de looking long and searchingly at her. Evidently he wondered if\nshe knew everything: but she returned his gaze fearlessly and frankly,\nand he apparently was satisfied.\n\nMadame D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de seemed to know nothing of the circumstances of that\nduel. D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de tried to draw Juliette out, to make her speak of her\nbrother. She replied to his questions quite openly, but there was\nnothing in what she said, suggestive of the fact that she knew who\nkilled her brother.\n\nShe wanted him to know who she was. If he feared an enemy in her, there\nwas yet time enough for him to close his doors against her.\n\nBut less than a minute later, he had renewed his warmest offers of\nhospitality.\n\n\"Until we can arrange for your journey to England,\" he added with a\nshort sigh, as if reluctant to part from her.\n\nTo Juliette his attitude seemed one of complete indifference for the\nwrong he had done to her and to her father: feeling that she was an\navenging spirit, with flaming sword in hand, pursuing her brother's\nmurderer like a relentless Nemesis, she would have preferred to see him\ncowed before her, even afraid of her, though she was only a young and\ndelicate girl.\n\nShe did not understand that in the simplicity of his heart, he only\nwished to make amends. The quarrel with the young Vicomte de Marny had\nbeen forced upon him, the fight had been honourable and fair, and on his\nside fought with every desire to spare the young man. He had merely been\nthe instrument of Fate, but he felt happy that Fate once more used him\nas her tool, this time to save the sister.\n\nWhilst D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and Juliette talked together Anne Mie cleared the\nsupper-table, then came and sat on a low stool at madame's feet. She\ntook no part in the conversation, but every now and then Juliette felt\nthe girl's melancholy eyes fixed almost reproachfully upon her.\n\nWhen Juliette had retired with P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle, D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de took Anne Mie's\nhand in his.\n\n\"You will be kind to my guest, Anne Mie, won't you? She seems very\nlonely, and has gone through a great deal.\"\n\n\"Not more than I have,\" murmured the young girl involuntarily.\n\n\"You are not happy, Anne Mie? I thought ...\"\n\n\"Is a wretched, deformed creature ever happy?\" she said with sudden\nvehemence, as tears of mortification rushed to her eyes, in spite of\nherself.\n\n\"I did not think that you were wretched,\" he replied with some sadness,\n\"and neither in my eyes, nor in my mother's, are you in any way\ndeformed.\"\n\nHer mood changed at once. She clung to him, pressing his hand between\nher own.\n\n\"Forgive me! I--I don't know what's the matter with me to-night,\" she\nsaid with a nervous little laugh. \"Let me see, you asked me to be kind\nto Mademoiselle Marny, did you not?\"\n\nHe nodded with a smile.\n\n\"Of course I'll be kind to her. Isn't every one kind to one who is young\nand beautiful, and has great, appealing eyes, and soft, curly hair? Ah\nme! how easy is the path in life for some people! What do you want me to\ndo, Paul? Wait on her? Be her little maid? Soothe her nerves or what?\nI'll do it all, though in her eyes I shall remain both wretched and\ndeformed, a creature to pity, the harmless, necessary house-dog ...\"\n\nShe paused a moment: said \"Good-night\" to him, and turned to go, candle\nin hand, looking pathetic and fragile, with that ugly contour of\nshoulder, which D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de assured her he could not see.\n\nThe candle flickered in the draught, illumining the thin, pinched face,\nthe large melancholy eyes of the faithful house-dog.\n\n\"Who can watch and bite!\" she said half-audibly as she slipped out of\nthe room. \"For I do not trust you, my fine madam, and there was\nsomething about that comedy this afternoon, which somehow, I don't quite\nunderstand.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nA day in the woods.\n\n\nBut whilst men and women set to work to make the towns of France hideous\nwith their shrieks and their hootings, their mock-trials and bloody\nguillotines, they could not quite prevent Nature from working her sweet\nwill with the country.\n\nJune, July, and August had received new names--they were now called\nMessidor, Thermidor, and Fructidor, but under these new names they\ncontinued to pour forth upon the earth the same old fruits, the same\nflowers, the same grass in the meadows and leaves upon the trees.\n\nMessidor brought its quota of wild roses in the hedgerows, just as\narchaic June had done. Thermidor covered the barren cornfields with its\nflaming mantle of scarlet poppies, and Fructidor, though now called\nAugust, still tipped the wild sorrel with dots of crimson, and laid the\nfirst wash of tender colour on the pale cheeks of the ripening peaches.\n\nAnd Juliette--young, girlish, feminine and inconsequent--had sighed for\ncountry and sunshine, had longed for a ramble in the woods, the music of\nthe birds, the sight of the meadows sugared with marguerites.\n\nShe had left the house early: accompanied by P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle, she had been\nrowed along the river as far as Suresnes. They had brought some bread\nand fresh butter, a little wine and fruit in a basket, and from here she\nmeant to wander homewards through the woods.\n\nIt was all so peaceful, so remote: even the noise of shrieking, howling\nParis did not reach the leafy thickets of Suresnes.\n\nIt almost seemed as if this little old-world village had been forgotten\nby the destroyers of France. It had never been a royal residence, the\nwoods had never been preserved for royal sport: there was no vengeance\nto be wreaked upon its peaceful glades and sleepy, fragrant meadows.\n\nJuliette spent a happy day; she loved the flowers, the trees, the birds,\nand P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle was silent and sympathetic. As the afternoon wore on, and\nit was time to go home, Juliette turned townwards with a sigh.\n\nYou all know that road through the woods, which lies to the north-west\nof Paris: so leafy, so secluded. No large, hundred-year-old trees, no\nfine oaks or antique elms, but numberless delicate stems of hazel-nut\nand young ash, covered with honeysuckle at this time of year,\nsweet-smelling and so peaceful after that awful turmoil of the town.\n\nObedient to Madame D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's suggestion, Juliette had tied a tricolour\nscarf round her waist, and a Phrygian cap of crimson cloth, with the\ninevitable rosette on one side, adorned her curly head.\n\nShe had gathered a huge bouquet of poppies, marguerites and blue lupin\n--Nature's tribute to the national colours--and as she wandered through\nthe sylvan glades she looked like some quaint dweller of the woods--a\nsprite, mayhap--with old mother P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle trotting behind her, like an\nattendant witch.\n\nSuddenly she paused, for in the near distance she had perceived the\nsound of footsteps upon the leafy turf, and the next moment Paul\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de emerged from out the thicket and came rapidly towards her.\n\n\"We were so anxious about you at home!\" he said, almost by way of an\napology. \"My mother became so restless ...\"\n\n\"That to quiet her fears you came in search of me!\" she retorted with a\ngay little laugh, the laugh of a young girl, scarce a woman as yet, who\nfeels that she is good to look at, good to talk to, who feels her wings\nfor the first time, the wings with which to soar into that mad, merry,\nelusive land called Romance. Ay, her wings! but her power also! that\nsweet, subtle power of the woman: the yoke which men love, rail at, and\nlove again, the yoke that enslaves them and gives them the joy of kings.\n\nHow happy the day had been! Yet it had been incomplete!\n\nP\u00c3\u00a9tronelle was somewhat dull, and Juliette was too young to enjoy long\ncompanionship with her own thoughts. Now suddenly the day seemed to have\nbecome perfect. There was someone there to appreciate the charm of the\nwoods, the beauty of that blue sky peeping though the tangled foliage of\nthe honeysuckle-covered trees. There was some one to talk to, someone to\nadmire the fresh white frock Juliette had put on that morning.\n\n\"But how did you know where to find me?\" she asked with a quaint touch\nof immature coquetry.\n\n\"I didn't know,\" he replied quietly. \"They told me you had gone to\nSuresness, and meant to wander homewards through the woods. It\nfrightened me, for you will have to go through the north-west barrier,\nand ...\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nHe smiled, and looked earnestly for a moment at the dainty apparition\nbefore him.\n\n\"Well, you know!\" he said gaily, \"that tricolour scarf and the red cap\nare not quite sufficient as a disguise: you look anything but a staunch\nfriend of the people. I guessed that your muslin frock would be clean,\nand that there would still be some tell-tale lace upon it.\"\n\nShe laughed again, and with delicate fingers lifted her pretty muslin\nfrock, displaying a white frou-frou of flounces beneath the hem.\n\n\"How careless and childish!\" he said, almost roughly.\n\n\"Would you have me coarse and grimy to be a fitting match for your\npartisans?\" she retorted.\n\nHis tone of mentor nettled her, his attitude seemed to her priggish and\ndictatorial, and as the sun disappearing behind a sudden cloud, so her\nchildish merriment quickly gave place to a feeling of unexplainable\ndisappointment.\n\n\"I humbly beg your pardon,\" he said quietly, \"And must crave your kind\nindulgence for my mood: but I have been so anxious ...\"\n\n\"Why should you be anxious about me?\"\n\nShe had meant to say this indifferently, as if caring little what the\nreply might be: but in her effort to seem indifferent her voice became\nhaughty, a reminiscence of the days when she still was the daughter of\nthe Duc de Marny, the richest and most high-born heiress in France.\n\n\"Was that presumptuous?\" he asked, with a slight touch of irony, in\nresponse to her own hauteur.\n\n\"It was merely unnecessary,\" she replied. \"I have already laid too many\nburdens on your shoulders, without wishing to add that of anxiety.\"\n\n\"You have laid no burden on me,\" he said quietly, \"save one of\ngratitude.\"\n\n\"Gratitude? What have I done?\"\n\n\"You committed a foolish, thoughtless act outside my door, and gave me\nthe chance of easing my conscience of a heavy load.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"I had never hoped that the Fates would be so kind as to allow me to\nrender a member of your family a slight service.\"\n\n\"I understand that you saved my life the other day, Monsieur D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de.\nI know that I am still in peril and that I owe my safety to you ...\"\n\n\"Do you also know that your brother owed his death to me?\"\n\nShe closed her lips firmly, unable to reply, wrathful with him, for\nhaving suddenly and without any warning, placed a clumsy hand upon that\nhidden sore.\n\n\"I always meant to tell you,\" he continued somewhat hurriedly; \"for it\nalmost seemed to me that I have been cheating you, these last few days.\nI don't suppose that you can quite realise what it means to me to tell\nyou this just now; but I owe it to you, I think. In later years you\nmight find out, and then regret the days you spent under my roof. I\ncalled you childish a moment ago, you must forgive me; I know that you\nare a woman, and hope therefore that you will understand me. I killed\nyour brother in fair fight. He provoked me as no man was ever provoked\nbefore ...\"\n\n\"Is it necessary, M. D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, that you should tell me all this?\" she\ninterrupted him with some impatience.\n\n\"I thought you ought to know.\"\n\n\"You must know, on the other hand, that I have no means of hearing the\nhistory of the quarrel from my brother's point of view now.\"\n\nThe moment the words were out of her lips she had realised how cruelly\nshe had spoken. He did not reply; he was too chivalrous, too gentle, to\nreproach her. Perhaps he understood for the first time how bitterly she\nhad felt her brother's death, and how deeply she must be suffering, now\nthat she knew herself to be face to face with his murderer.\n\nShe stole a quick glance at him, through her tears. She was deeply\npenitent for what she had said. It almost seemed to her as if a dual\nnature was at war within her.\n\nThe mention of her brother's name, the recollection of that awful night\nbeside his dead body, of those four years whilst she watched her\nfather's moribund reason slowly wandering towards the grave, seemed to\nrouse in her a spirit of rebellion, and of evil, which she felt was not\nentirely of herself.\n\nThe woods had become quite silent. It was late afternoon, and they had\ngradually wandered farther and farther away from pretty sylvan\nSuresness, towards great, anarchic, deathdealing Paris. In this part of\nthe woods the birds had left their homes; the trees, shorn of their\nlower branches looked like gaunt spectres, raising melancholy heads\ntowards the relentless, silent sky.\n\nIn the distance, from behind the barriers, a couple of miles away, the\nboom of a gun was heard.\n\n\"They are closing the barriers,\" he said quietly after a long pause. \"I\nam glad I was fortunate enough to meet you.\"\n\n\"It was kind of you to seek for me,\" she said meekly. \"I didn't mean\nwhat I said just now ...\"\n\n\"I pray you, say no more about it. I can so well understand. I only wish\n...\"\n\n\"It would be best I should leave your house,\" she said gently; \"I have\nso ill repaid your hospitality. P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle and I can easily go back to\nour lodgings.\"\n\n\"You would break my mother's heart if you left her now,\" he said, almost\nroughly. \"She has become very fond of you, and knows, just as well as I\ndo, the dangers that would beset you outside my house. My coarse and\ngrimy partisans,\" he added, with a bitter touch of sarcasm, \"have that\nadvantage, that they are loyal to me, and would not harm you while under\nmy roof.\"\n\n\"But you ...\" she murmured.\n\nShe felt somehow that she had wounded him very deeply, and was half\nangry with herself for her seeming ingratitude, and yet childishly glad\nto have suppressed in him that attitude of mentorship, which he was\nbeginning to assume over her.\n\n\"You need not fear that my presence will offend you much longer,\nmademoiselle,\" he said coldly. \"I can quite understand how hateful it\nmust be to you, though I would have wished that you could believe at\nleast in my sincerity.\"\n\n\"Are you going away then?\"\n\n\"Not out of Paris altogether. I have accepted the post of Governor of\nthe Conciergerie.\"\n\n\"Ah!--where the poor Queen ...\"\n\nShe checked herself suddenly. Those words would have been called\ntreasonable to the people of France.\n\nInstinctively and furtively, as everyone did in these days, she cast a\nrapid glance behind her.\n\n\"You need not be afraid,\" he said; \"there is no one here but\nP\u00c3\u00a9tronelle.\"\n\n\"And you.\"\n\n\"Oh! I echo your words. Poor Marie Antoinette!\"\n\n\"You pity her?\"\n\n\"How can I help it?\"\n\n\"But your are that horrible National Convention, who will try her,\ncondemn her, execute her as they did the King.\"\n\n\"I am of the National Convention. But I will not condemn her, nor be a\nparty to another crime. I go as Governor of the Conciergerie, to help\nher, if I can.\"\n\n\"But your popularity--your life--if you befriend her?\"\n\n\"As you say, mademoiselle, my life, if I befriend her,\" he said simply.\n\nShe looked at him with renewed curiosity in her gaze.\n\nHow strange were men in these days! Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, the republican, the\nrecognised idol of the lawless people of France, was about to risk his\nlife for the woman he had helped to dethrone.\n\nPity with him did not end with the rabble of Paris; it had reached\nCharlotte Corday, though it failed to save her, and now it extended to\nthe poor dispossessed Queen. Somehow, in his face this time, she saw\neither success or death.\n\n\"When do you leave?\" she asked.\n\n\"To-morrow night.\"\n\nShe said nothing more. Strangely enough, a tinge of melancholy had\nsettled over her spirits. No doubt the proximity of the town was the\ncause of this. She could already hear the familiar noise of muffled\ndrums, the loud, excited shrieking of the mob, who stood round the gates\nof Paris, at this time of the evening, waiting to witness some important\ncapture, perhaps that of a hated aristocrat striving to escape from the\npeople's revenge.\n\nThey had reached the edge of the wood, and gradually, as she walked, the\nflowers she had gathered fell unheeded out of her listless hands one by\none.\n\nFirst the blue lupins: their bud-laden heads were heavy and they dropped\nto the ground, followed by the white marguerites, that lay thick behind\nher now on the grass like a shroud. The red poppies were the lightest,\ntheir thin gummy stalks clung to her hands longer than the rest. At last\nshe let them fall too, singly, like great drops of blood, that glistened\nas her long white gown swept them aside.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de was absorbed in his thoughts, and seemed not to heed her. At\nthe barrier, however, he roused himself and took out the passes which\nalone enabled Juliette and P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle to re-enter the town unchallenged.\nHe himself as Citizen-Deputy could come and go as he wished.\n\nJuliette shuddered as the great gates closed behind her with a heavy\nclank. It seemed to shut out even the memory of this happy day, which\nfor a brief space had been quite perfect.\n\nShe did not know Paris very well, and wondered where lay that gloomy\nConciergerie, where a dethroned queen was living her last days, in an\nagonised memory of the past. But as they crossed the bridge she\nrecognised all round her the massive towers of the great city: Notre\nDame, the grateful spire of La Sainte Chapelle, the sombre outline of\nSt. Gervais, and behind her the Louvre with its great history and\nirreclaimable grandeur. How small her own tragedy seemed in the midst of\nthis great sanguinary drama, the last act of which had not yet even\nbegun. Her own revenge, her oath, her tribulations, what were they in\ncomparison with that great flaming Nemesis which had swept away a\nthrone, that vow of retaliation carried out by thousands against other\nthousands, that long story of degradation, of regicide, of fratricide,\nthe awesome chapters of which were still being unfolded one by one?\n\nShe felt small and petty: ashamed of the pleasure she had felt in the\nwoods, ashamed of her high spirits and light-heartedness, ashamed of\nthat feeling of sudden pity and admiration for the man who had done her\nand her family so deep an injury, which she was too feeble, too\nvacillating to avenge.\n\nThe majestic outline of the Louvre seemed to frown sarcastically on her\nweakness, the silent river to mock her and her wavering purpose. The man\nbeside her had wronged her and hers far more deeply than the Bourbons\nhad wronged their people. The people of France were taking their\nrevenge, and God had at the close of this last happy day of her life\npointed once more to the means for her great end.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel.\n\n\nIt was some few hours later. The ladies sat in the drawing-room, silent\nand anxious.\n\nSoon after supper a visitor had called, and had been closeted with Paul\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de in the latter's study for the past two hours.\n\nA tall, somewhat lazy-looking figure, he was sitting at a table face to\nface with the Citizen-Deputy. On a chair beside him lay a heavy caped\ncoat, covered with the dust and the splashings of a long journey, but he\nhimself was attired in clothes that suggested the most fastidious taste,\nand the most perfect of tailors; he wore with apparent ease the\neccentric fashion of the time, the short-waisted coat of many lapels,\nthe double waistcoat and billows of delicate lace. Unlike D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de he\nwas of great height, with fair hair and a somewhat lazy expression in\nhis good-natured blue eyes, and as he spoke, there was just a soup\u00c3\u00a7on of\nforeign accent in the pronunciation of the French vowels, a certain\ndrawl of o's and a's, that would have betrayed the Britisher to an\nobservant ear.\n\nThe two men had been talking earnestly for some time, the tall\nEnglishman was watching his friend keenly, whilst an amused, pleasant\nsmile lingered round the corners of his firm mouth and jaw. D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de,\nrestless and enthusiastic, was pacing to and fro.\n\n\"But I don't understand now, how you managed to reach Paris, my dear\nBlakeney!\" said D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de at last, placing an anxious hand on his\nfriend's shoulder. \"The government has not forgotten The Scarlet\nPimpernel.\"\n\n\"La! I took care of that!\" responded Blakeney with his short, pleasant\nlaugh. \"I sent Tinville my autograph this morning.\"\n\n\"You are mad, Blakeney!\"\n\n\"Not altogether, my friend. My faith! 'twas not only foolhardiness caused\nme to grant that devilish prosecutor another sight of my scarlet device.\nI knew what you maniacs would be after, so I came across in the\n_Daydream,_just to see if I couldn't get my share of the fun.\"\n\n\"Fun, you call it?\" queried the other bitterly.\n\n\"Nay! what would you have me call it? A mad, insane, senseless tragedy,\nwith but one issue?--the guillotine for you all.\"\n\n\"Then why did you come?\"\n\n\"To--What shall I say, my friend?\" rejoined Sir Percy Blakeney, with\nthat inimitable drawl of his. \"To give your demmed government something\nelse to think about, whilst you are all busy running your heads into a\nnoose.\"\n\n\"What makes you think we are doing that?\"\n\n\"Three things, my friend--may I offer you a pinch of snuff--No?--Ah\nwell!...\" And with the graceful gesture of an accomplished dandy, Sir\nPercy flicked off a grain of dust from his immaculate Mechlin ruffles.\n\n\"Three things,\" he continued quietly; \"an imprisoned Queen, about to be\ntried for her life, the temperament of a Frenchman--some of them--and\nthe idiocy of mankind generally. These three things make me think that a\ncertain section of hot-headed Republicans with yourself, my dear\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, _en t\u00c3\u00aate,_ are about to attempt the most stupid, senseless,\npurposeless thing that was ever concocted by the excitable brain of a\ndemmed Frenchman.\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de smiled.\n\n\"Does it not seem amusing to you, Blakeney, that you should sit there\nand condemn anyone for planning mad, insane, senseless things.\"\n\n\"La! I'll not sit, I'll stand!\" rejoined Blakeney with a laugh, as he\ndrew himself up to his full height, and stretched his long, lazy limbs.\n\"And now let me tell you, friend, that my League of The Scarlet\nPimpernel never attempted the impossible, and to try and drag the Queen\nout of the clutches of these murderous rascals now, is attempting the\nunattainable.\"\n\n\"And yet we mean to try.\"\n\n\"I know it. I guessed it, that is why I came: that is also why I sent a\npleasant little note to the Committee of Public Safety, signed with the\ndevice they know so well: The Scarlet Pimpernel.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well! the result is obvious. Robespierre, Danton, Tinville, Merlin, and\nthe whole of the demmed murderous crowd, will be busy looking after\nme--a needle in a haystack. They'll put the abortive attempt down to me,\nand you may--_ma foi!_ I only suggest that you _may_ escape safely out\nof France--in the _Daydream,_ and with the help of your humble servant.\"\n\n\"But in the meanwhile they'll discover you, and they'll not let you\nescape a second time.\"\n\n\"My friend! if a terrier were to lose his temper, he never would run a\nrat to earth. Now your Revolutionary Government has lost its temper with\nme, ever since I slipped through Chauvelin's fingers; they are blind\nwith their own fury, whilst I am perfectly happy and cool as a cucumber.\nMy life has become valuable to me, my friend. There is someone over the\nwater now who weeps when I don't return--No! no! never fear--they'll not\nget The Scarlet Pimpernel this journey ...\"\n\nHe laughed, a gay, pleasant laugh, and his strong, firm face seemed to\nsoften at thought of the beautiful wife, over in England, who was\nwaiting anxiously for his safe return.\n\n\"And yet you'll not help us to rescue the Queen?\" rejoined D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de,\nwith some bitterness.\n\n\"By every means in my power,\" replied Blakeney, \"save the insane. But I\nwill help to get you all out of the demmed hole, when you have failed.\"\n\n\"We'll not fail,\" asserted the other hotly.\n\nSir Percy Blakeney went close up to his friend and placed his long,\nslender hand, with a touch of almost womanly tenderness upon the\nlatter's shoulder.\n\n\"Will you tell me your plans?\"\n\nIn a moment D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de was all fire and enthusiasm.\n\n\"There are not many of us in it,\" he began, \"although half France will\nbe in sympathy with us. We have plenty of money, of course, and also the\nnecessary disguise for the royal lady.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I, in the meanwhile, have asked for and obtained the post of Governor\nof the Conciergerie; I go into my new quarters to-morrow. In the\nmeanwhile, I am making arrangements for my mother and--and those\ndependent upon me to quit France immediately.\"\n\nBlakeney had perceived the slight hesitation when D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de mentioned\nthose dependent upon him. He looked scrutinisingly at his friend, who\ncontinued quickly:\n\n\"I am still very popular among the people. My family can go about\nunmolested. I must get them out of France, however, in case--in case\n...\"\n\n\"Of course,\" rejoined the other simply.\n\n\"As soon as I am assured that they are safe, my friends and I can\nprosecute our plans. You see the trial of the Queen has not yet been\ndecided on, but I know that it is in the air. We hope to get her away,\ndisguised in one of the uniforms of the National Guard. As you know, it\nwill be my duty to make the final round every evening in the prison, and\nto see that everything is safe for the night. Two fellows watch all\nnight, in the room next to that occupied by the Queen. Usually they\ndrink and play cards all night long. I want an opportunity to drug their\nbrandy, and thus to render them more loutish and idiotic than usual;\nthen for a blow on the head that will make them senseless. It should be\neasy, for I have a strong fist, and after that ...\"\n\n\"Well? After that, friend?\" rejoined Sir Percy earnestly, \"after that?\nShall I fill in the details of the picture?--the guard twenty-five\nstrong outside the Conciergerie, how will you pass them?\"\n\n\"I as the Governor, followed by one of my guards ...\"\n\n\"To go whither?\"\n\n\"I have the right to come and go as I please.\"\n\n\"I' faith! so you have, but 'one of your guards'--eh? Wrapped to the\neyes in a long mantle to hide the female figure beneath. I have been in\nParis but a few hours, and yet already I have realised that there is not\none demmed citizen within its walls, who does not at this moment suspect\nsome other demmed citizen of conniving at the Queen's escape. Even the\nsparrows on the house-tops are objects of suspicion. No figure wrapped\nin a mantle will from this day forth leave Paris unchallenged.\"\n\n\"But you yourself, friend?\" suggested D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de. \"You think you can quit\nParis unrecognised--then why not the Queen?\"\n\n\"Because she is a woman, and has been a queen. She has nerves, poor\nsoul, and weaknesses of body and of mind now. Alas for her! Alas for\nFrance! who wreaks such idle vengeance on so poor an enemy? Can you take\nhold of Marie Antoinette by the shoulders, shove her into the bottom of\na cart and pile sacks of potatoes on the top of her? I did that to the\nComtesse de Tournai and her daughter, as stiff-necked a pair of French\naristocrats as ever deserved the guillotine for their insane prejudices.\nBut can you do it to Marie Antoinette? She'd rebuke you publicly, and\nbetray herself and you in a flash, sooner than submit to a loss of\ndignity.\"\n\n\"But would you leave her to her fate?\"\n\n\"Ah! there's the trouble, friend. Do you think you need appeal to the\nsense of chivalry of my league? We are still twenty strong, and heart\nand soul in sympathy with your mad schemes. The poor, poor Queen! But\nyou are bound to fail, and then who will help you all, if we too are put\nout of the way?\"\n\n\"We should succeed if you helped us. At one time you used proudly to\nsay: 'The League of The Scarlet Pimpernel has never failed.'\"\n\n\"Because it attempted nothing which it could not accomplish. But, la!\nsince you put me on my mettle--Demm it all! I'll have to think about\nit!\"\n\nAnd he laughed that funny, somewhat inane laugh of his, which had\ndeceived the clever men of two countries as to his real personality.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de went up to the heavy oak desk which occupied a conspicuous\nplace in the centre of one of the walls. He unlocked it and drew forth a\nbundle of papers.\n\n\"Will you look through these?\" he asked, handing them to Sir Percy\nBlakeney.\n\n\"What are they?\"\n\n\"Different schemes I have drawn up, in case my original plan should not\nsucceed.\"\n\n\"Burn them, my friend,\" said Blakeney laconically. \"Have you not yet\nlearned the lesson of never putting your hand to paper?\"\n\n\"I can't burn these. You see, I shall not be able to have long\nconversations with Marie Antoinette. I must give her my suggestions in\nwriting, that she may study them and not fail me, through lack of\nknowledge of her part.\"\n\n\"Better that than papers in these times, my friend: these papers, if\nfound, would send you, untried, to the guillotine.\"\n\n\"I am careful, and, at present, quite beyond suspicion. Moreover, among\nthe papers is a complete collection of passports, suitable for any\ncharacter the Queen and her attendant may be forced to assume. It has\ntaken me some months to collect them, so as not to arouse suspicion; I\ngradually got them together, on one pretence or another: now I am ready\nfor any eventuality ...\"\n\nHe suddenly paused. A look in his friend's face had given him a swift\nwarning.\n\nHe turned, and there in the doorway, holding back the heavy porti\u00c3\u00a8re,\nstood Juliette, graceful, smiling, a little pale, this no doubt owing to\nthe flickering light of the unsnuffed candles.\n\nSo young and girlish did she look in her soft, white muslin frock that\nat sight of her the tension in D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's face seemed to relax.\nInstinctively he had thrown the papers back into the desk, but his look\nhad softened, from the fire of obstinate energy to that of inexpressible\ntenderness.\n\nBlakeney was quietly watching the young girl as she stood in the\ndoorway, a little bashful and undecided.\n\n\"Madame D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de sent me,\" she said hesitatingly, \"she says the hour is\ngetting late and she is very anxious. M. D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, would you come and\nreassure her?\"\n\n\"In a moment, mademoiselle,\" he replied lightly, \"my friend and I have\njust finished our talk. May I have the honour to present him?--Sir Percy\nBlakeney, a traveller from England. Blakeney, this is Mademoiselle\nJuliette de Marny, my mother's guest.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nA warning.\n\n\nSir Percy bowed very low, with all the graceful flourish and elaborate\ngesture the eccentric customs of the time demanded.\n\nHe had not said a word, since the first exclamation of warning, with\nwhich he had drawn his friend's attention to the young girl in the\ndoorway.\n\nNoiselessly, as she had come, Juliette glided out of the room again,\nleaving behind her an atmosphere of wild flowers, of the bouquet she had\ngathered, then scattered in the woods.\n\nThere was silence in the room for awhile. D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de was locking up his\ndesk and slipping the keys into his pocket.\n\n\"Shall we join my mother for a moment, Blakeney?\" he said, moving\ntowards the door.\n\n\"I shall be proud to pay my respects,\" replied Sir Percy; \"but before we\nclose the subject, I think I'll change my mind about those papers. If I\nam to be of service to you I think I had best look through them, and\ngive you my opinion of your schemes.\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de looked at him keenly for a moment.\n\n\"Certainly,\" he said at last, going up to his desk. \"I'll stay with you\nwhilst you read them through.\"\n\n\"La! not to-night, my friend,\" said Sir Percy lightly; \"the hour is\nlate, and madame is waiting for us. They'll be quite safe with me, and\nyou'll entrust them to my care.\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de seemed to hesitate. Blakeney had spoken in his usual airy\nmanner, and was even now busy readjusting the set of his\nperfectly-tailored coat.\n\n\"Perhaps you cannot quite trust me?\" laughed Sir Percy gaily. \"I seemed\ntoo lukewarm just now.\"\n\n\"No; it's not that, Blakeney!\" said D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de quietly at last. \"There is\nno mistrust in me, all the mistrust is on your side.\"\n\n\"Faith!--\" began Sir Percy.\n\n\"Nay! do not explain. I understand and appreciate your friendship, but I\nshould like to convince you how unjust is your mistrust of one of God's\npurest angels, that ever walked the earth.\"\n\n\"Oho! that's it, is it, friend D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de? Methought you had foresworn\nthe sex altogether, and now you are in love.\"\n\n\"Madly, blindly, stupidly in love, my friend,\" said D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de with a\nsigh. \"Hopelessly, I fear me!\"\n\n\"Why hopelessly?\"\n\n\"She is the daughter of the late Duc de Marny, one of the oldest names\nin France; a Royalist to the backbone ...\"\n\n\"Hence your overwhelming sympathy for the Queen!\"\n\n\"Nay! you wrong me there, friend. I'd have tried to save the Queen, even\nif I had never learned to love Juliette. But you see now how unjust were\nyour suspicions.\"\n\n\"Had I any?\"\n\n\"Don't deny it. You were loud in urging me to burn those papers a moment\nago. You called them useless and dangerous and now ...\"\n\n\"I still think them useless and dangerous, and by reading them would\nwish to confirm my opinion and give weight to my arguments.\"\n\n\"If I were to part from them now I would seem to be mistrusting her.\"\n\n\"You are a mad idealist, my dear D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de!\"\n\n\"How can I help it? I have lived under the same roof with her for three\nweeks now. I have begun to understand what a saint is like.\"\n\n\"And 'twill be when you understand that your idol has feet of clay that\nyou'll learn the real lesson of love,\" said Blakeney earnestly.\n\n\"Is it love to worship a saint in heaven, whom you dare not touch, who\nhovers above you like a cloud, which floats away from you even as you\ngaze? To love is to feel one being in the world at one with us, our\nequal in sin as well as in virtue. To love, for us men, is to clasp one\nwoman with our arms, feeling that she lives and breathes just as we do,\nsuffers as we do, thinks with us, loves with us, and, above all, sins\nwith us. Your mock saint who stands in a niche is not a woman if she\nhave not suffered, still less a woman if she have not sinned. Fall at\nthe feet of your idol an you wish, but drag her down to your level after\nthat--the only level she should ever reach, that of your heart.\"\n\nWho shall render faithfully a true account of the magnetism which poured\nforth from this remarkable man as he spoke: this well-dressed, foppish\napostle of the greatest love that man has ever known. And as he spoke\nthe whole story of his own great, true love for the woman who once had\nso deeply wronged him seemed to stand clearly written in the strong,\nlazy, good-humoured, kindly face glowing with tenderness for her.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de felt this magnetism, and therefore did not resent the implied\nsuggestion, anent the saint whom he was still content to worship.\n\nA dreamer and an idealist, his mind held spellbound by the great social\nproblems which were causing the upheaval of a whole country, he had not\nyet had the time to learn the sweet lesson which Nature teaches to her\nelect--the lesson of a great, a true, human and passionate love. To him,\nat present, Juliette represented the perfect embodiment of his most\nidealistic dreams. She stood in his mind so far above him that if she\nproved unattainable, he would scarce have suffered. It was such a\nforegone conclusion.\n\nBlakeney's words were the first to stir in his heart a desire for\nsomething beyond that quasi-mediaeval worship, something weaker and yet\ninfinitely stronger, something more earthy and yet almost divine.\n\n\"And now, shall we join the ladies?\" said Blakeney after a long pause,\nduring which the mental workings of his alert brain were almost visible,\nin the earnest look which he cast at his friend. \"You shall keep the\npapers in your desk, give them into the keeping of your saint, trust her\nall in all rather than not at all, and if the time should come that your\nheaven-enthroned ideal fall somewhat heavily to earth, then give me the\nprivilege of being a witness to your happiness.\"\n\n\"You are still mistrustful, Blakeney,\" said D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de lightly. \"If you\nsay much more I'll give these papers into Mademoiselle Marny's keeping\nuntil to-morrow.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nAnne Mie.\n\n\nThat night, when Blakeney, wrapped in his cloak, was walking down the\nRue Ecole de M\u00c3\u00a9decine towards his own lodgings, he suddenly felt a timid\nhand upon his sleeve.\n\nAnne Mie stood beside him, her pale, melancholy face peeping up at the\ntall Englishman, through the folds of a dark hood closely tied under her\nchin.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" she said timidly, \"do not think me very presumptuous. I--I\nwould wish to have five minutes' talk with you--may I?\"\n\nHe looked down with great kindness at the quaint, wizened little figure,\nand the strong face softened at the sight of the poor, deformed\nshoulder, the hard, pinched look of the young mouth, the general look of\npathetic helplessness which appeals so strongly to the chivalrous.\n\n\"Indeed, mademoiselle,\" he said gently, \"you make me very proud; and I\ncan serve you in any way, I pray you command me. But,\" he added, seeing\nAnne Mie's somewhat scared look, \"this street is scarce fit for private\nconversation. Shall we try and find a better spot?\"\n\nParis had not yet gone to bed. In these times it was really safest to be\nout in the open streets. There, everybody was more busy, more on the\nmove, on the lookout for suspected houses, leaving the wanderer alone.\n\nBlakeney led Anne Mie towards the Luxembourg Gardens, the great\ndevastated pleasure-ground of the ci-devant tyrants of the people. The\nbeautiful Anne of Austria, and the Medici before her, Louis XIII, and\nhis gallant musketeers--all have given place to the great cannon-forging\nindustry of this besieged Republic. France, attacked on every side, is\nforcing her sons to defend her: persecuted, martyrised, done to death by\nher, she is still their Mother: La Patrie, who needs their arms against\nthe foreign foe. England is threatening the north, Prussia and Austria\nthe east. Admiral Hood's flag is flying on Toulon Arsenal.\n\nThe siege of the Republic!\n\nAnd the Republic is fighting for dear life. The Tuileries and Luxembourg\nGardens are transformed into a township of gigantic smithies; and Anne\nMie, with scared eyes, and clinging to Blakeney's arm, cast furtive,\nterrified glances at the huge furnaces and the begrimed, darkly scowling\nfaces of the workers within.\n\n\"The people of France in arms against tyranny!\" Great placards, bearing\nthese inspiriting words, are affixed to gallows-shaped posts, and\nflutter in the evening breeze, rendered scorching by the heat of the\nfurnaces all around.\n\nFarther on, a group of older men, squatting on the ground, are busy\nmaking tents, and some women--the same Megaeras who daily shriek round\nthe guillotine--are plying their needles and scissors for the purpose of\nmaking clothes for the soldiers.\n\nThe soldiers are the entire able-bodied male population of France.\n\n\"The people of France in arms against tyranny!\"\n\nThat is their sign, their trade-mark; one of these placards, fitfully\nillumined by a torch of resin, towers above a group of children busy\ntearing up scraps of old linen--their mothers', their sisters' linen\n--in order to make lint for the wounded.\n\nLoud curses and suppressed mutterings fill the smoke-laden air.\n\nThe people of France, in arms against tyranny, is bending its broad back\nbefore the most cruel, the most absolute and brutish slave-driving ever\nexercised over mankind.\n\nNot even mediaeval Christianity has ever dared such wholesale\nenforcements of its doctrines, as this constitution of Liberty and\nFraternity.\n\nMerlin's \"Law of the Suspect\" has just been formulated. From now onward\neach and every citizen of France must watch his words, his looks, his\ngestures, lest they be suspect. Of what--of treason to the Republic, to\nthe people? Nay, worse! lest they be suspect of being suspect to the\ngreat era of Liberty.\n\nTherefore in the smithies and among the groups of tent-makers a moment's\nnegligence, a careless attention to the work, might lead to a brief\ntrial on the morrow and the inevitable guillotine. Negligence is treason\nto the higher interests of the Republic.\n\nBlakeney dragged Anne Mie away from the sight. These roaring furnaces\nfrightened her; he took her down the Place St Michel, towards the river.\nIt was quieter here.\n\n\"What dreadful people they have become,\" she said, shuddering; \"even I\ncan remember how different they used to be.\"\n\nThe houses on the banks of the river were mostly converted into\nhospitals, preparatory for the great siege. Some hundred m\u00c3\u00a8tres lower\ndown, the new children's hospital, endowed by Citizen-Deputy D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de,\nloomed, white, clean, and comfortable-looking, amidst its more squalid\nfellows.\n\n\"I think it would be best not to sit down,\" suggested Blakeney, \"and\nwiser for you to throw your hood away from your face.\"\n\nHe seemed to have no fears for himself; many had said that he bore a\ncharmed life; and yet ever since Admiral Hood had planted his flag on\nToulon Arsenal, the English were more feared than ever, and The Scarlet\nPimpernel more hated than most.\n\n\"You wished to speak to me about Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de,\" he said kindly, seeing\nthat the young girl was making desperate efforts to say what lay on her\nmind. \"He is my friend, you know.\"\n\n\"Yes; that is why I wished to ask you a question,\" she replied.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Who is Juliette de Marny, and why did she seek an entrance into Paul's\nhouse?\"\n\n\"Did she seek it, then?\"\n\n\"Yes; I saw the scene from the balcony. At the time it did not strike me\nas a farce. I merely thought that she had been stupid and foolhardy. But\nsince then I have reflected. She provoked the mob of the street,\nwilfully, just at the very moment when she reached M. D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's door.\nShe meant to appeal to his chivalry, and called for help, well knowing\nthat he would respond.\"\n\nShe spoke rapidly and excitedly now, throwing off all shyness and\nreserve. Blakeney was forced to check her vehemence, which might have\nbeen thought \"suspicious\" by some idle citizen unpleasantly inclined.\n\n\"Well? And now?\" he asked, for the young girl had paused, as if ashamed\nof her excitement.\n\n\"And now she stays in the house, on and on, day after day,\" continued\nAnne Mie, speaking more quietly, though with no less intensity. \"Why\ndoes she not go? She is not safe in France. She belongs to the most\nhated of all the classes--the idle, rich aristocrats of the old r\u00c3\u00a9gime.\nPaul has several times suggested plans for her emigration to England.\nMadame D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, who is an angel, loves her, and would not like to part\nfrom her, but it would be obviously wiser for her to go, and yet she\nstays. Why?\"\n\n\"Presumably because ...\"\n\n\"Because she is in love with Paul?\" interrupted Anne Mie vehemently.\n\"No, no; she does not love him--at least--Oh! sometimes I don't know.\nHer eyes light up when he comes, and she is listless when he goes. She\nalways spends a longer time over her toilet, when we expect him home to\ndinner,\" she added, with a touch of na\u00c3\u00afve femininity. \"But--if it be\nlove, then that love is strange and unwomanly; it is a love that will\nnot be for his good ...\"\n\n\"Why should you think that?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said the girl simply. \"Isn't it an instinct?\"\n\n\"Not a very unerring one in this case, I fear.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because your own love for Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de has blinded you--- Ah! you\nmust pardon me, mademoiselle; you sought this conversation and not I,\nand I fear me I have wounded you. Yet I would wish you to know how deep\nis my sympathy with you, and how great my desire to render you a service\nif I could.\"\n\n\"I was about to ask a service of you, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Then command me, I beg of you.\"\n\n\"You are Paul's friend--persuade him that that woman in his house is a\nstanding danger to his life and liberty.\"\n\n\"He would not listen to me.\"\n\n\"Oh! a man always listens to another.\"\n\n\"Except on one subject--the woman he loves.\"\n\nHe had said the last words very gently but very firmly. He was deeply,\ntenderly sorry for the poor, deformed, fragile girl, doomed to be a\nwitness of that most heartrending of human tragedies, the passing away\nof her own scarce-hoped-for happiness. But he felt that at this moment\nthe kindest act would be one of complete truth. He knew that Paul\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's heart was completely given to Juliette de Marny; he too,\nlike Anne Mie, instinctively mistrusted the beautiful girl and her\nstrange, silent ways, but, unlike the poor hunchback, he knew that no\nsin which Juliette might commit would henceforth tear her from out the\nheart of his friend; that if, indeed, she turned out to be false, or\neven treacherous, she would, nevertheless, still hold a place in\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's very soul, which no one else would ever fill.\n\n\"You think he loves her?\" asked Anne Mie at last.\n\n\"I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"And she?\"\n\n\"Ah! I do not know. I would trust your instinct--a woman's--sooner than\nmy own.\"\n\n\"She is false, I tell you, and is hatching treason against Paul.\"\n\n\"Then all we can do is to wait.\"\n\n\"Wait?\"\n\n\"And watch carefully, earnestly, all the time. There! shall I pledge you\nmy word that D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de shall come to no harm?\"\n\n\"Pledge me your word that you'll part him from that woman.\"\n\n\"Nay; that is beyond my power. A man like Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de only loves once\nin life, but when he does, it is for always.\"\n\nOnce more she was silent, pressing her lips closely together, as if\nafraid of what she might say.\n\nHe saw that she was bitterly disappointed, and sought for a means of\ntempering the cruelty of the blow.\n\n\"It will be your task to watch over Paul,\" he said; \"with your\nfriendship to guard and protect him, we need have no fear for his\nsafety, I think.\"\n\n\"I will watch,\" she replied quietly.\n\nGradually he had led her steps back towards the Rue Ecole de M\u00c3\u00a9decine.\n\nA great melancholy had fallen over his bold, adventurous spirit. How\nfull of tragedies was this great city, in the last throes of its insane\nand cruel struggle for an unattainable goal. And yet, despite its\nguillotine and mock trials, its tyrannical laws and overfilled prisons,\nits very sorrows paled before the dead, dull misery of this deformed\ngirl's heart.\n\nA wild exaltation, a fever of enthusiasm lent glamour to the scenes\nwhich were daily enacted on the Place de la Revolution, turning the\nfinal acts of the tragedies into glaring, lurid melodrama, almost unreal\nin its poignant appeal to the sensibilities.\n\nBut here there was only this dead, dull misery, an aching heart, a poor,\nfragile creature in the throes of an agonised struggle for a\nfast-disappearing happiness.\n\nAnne Mie hardly knew now what she had hoped, when she sought this\ninterview with Sir Percy Blakeney. Drowning in a sea of hopelessness,\nshe had clutched at what might prove a chance of safety. Her reason told\nher that Paul's friend was right. D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de was a man who would love but\nonce in his life. He had never loved--for he had too much pitied--poor,\npathetic little Anne Mie.\n\nNay; why should we say that love and pity are akin?\n\nLove, the great, the strong, the conquering god--Love that subdues a\nworld, and rides roughshod over principle, virtue, tradition, over home,\nkindred, and religion--what cares he for the easy conquest of the\npathetic being, who appeals to his sympathy?\n\nLove means equality--the same height of heroism or of sin. When Love\nstoops to pity, he has ceased to soar in the boundless space, that\nrarefied atmosphere wherein man feels himself made at last truly in the\nimage of God.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nJealousy.\n\n\nAt the door of her home Blakeney parted from Anne Mie, with all the\ncourtesy with which he would have bade adieu to the greatest lady in his\nown land.\n\nAnne Mie let herself into the house with her own latch-key. She closed\nthe heavy door noiselessly, then glided upstairs like a quaint little\nghost.\n\nBut on the landing above she met Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de.\n\nHe had just come out of his room, and was still fully dressed.\n\n\"Anne Mie!\" he said, with such an obvious cry of pleasure, that the\nyoung girl, with beating heart, paused a moment on the top of the\nstairs, as if hoping to hear that cry again, feeling that indeed he was\nglad to see her, had been uneasy because of her long absence.\n\n\"Have I made you anxious?\" she asked at last.\n\n\"Anxious!\" he exclaimed. \"Little one, I have hardly lived this last\nhour, since I realised that you had gone out so late as this, and all\nalone.\"\n\n\"How did you know?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle de Marny knocked at my door an hour ago. She had gone to\nyour room to see you, and, not finding you there, she searched the house\nfor you, and finally, in her anxiety, came to me. We did not dare to\ntell my mother. I won't ask you where you have been, Anne Mie, but\nanother time, remember, little one, that the streets of Paris are not\nsafe, and that those who love you suffer deeply, when they know you to\nbe in peril.\"\n\n\"Those who love me!\" murmured the girl under her breath.\n\n\"Could you not have asked me to come with you?\"\n\n\"No; I wanted to be alone. The streets were quite safe, and--I wanted to\nspeak with Sir Percy Blakeney.\"\n\n\"With Blakeney?\" he exclaimed in boundless astonishment. \"Why, what in\nthe world did you want to say him?\"\n\nThe girl, so unaccustomed to lying, had blurted out the truth, almost\nagainst her will.\n\n\"I thought he could help me, as I was much perturbed and restless.\"\n\n\"You went to him sooner than to me?\" said D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de in a tone of gentle\nreproach, and still puzzled at this extraordinary action on the part of\nthe girl, usually so shy and reserved.\n\n\"My anxiety was about you, and you would have mocked me for it.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I should never mock you, Anne Mie. But why should you be\nanxious about me?\"\n\n\"Because I see you wandering blindly on the brink of a great danger, and\nbecause I see you confiding in those, whom you had best mistrust.\"\n\nHe frowned a little, and bit his lip to check the rough word that was on\nthe tip of his tongue.\n\n\"Is Sir Percy Blakeney one of those whom I had best mistrust?\" he said\nlightly.\n\n\"No,\" she answered curtly.\n\n\"Then, dear, there is no cause for unrest. He is the only one of my\nfriends whom you have not known intimately. All those who are round me\nnow, you know that you can trust and that you can love,\" he added\nearnestly and significantly.\n\nHe took her hand; it was trembling with obvious suppressed agitation.\nShe knew that he had guessed what was passing in her mind, and now was\ndeeply ashamed of what she had done. She had been tortured with jealousy\nfor the past three weeks, but at least she had suffered quite alone: no\none had been allowed to touch that wound, which more often than not,\nexcites derision rather than pity. Now, by her own actions, two men knew\nher secret. Both were kind and sympathetic; but D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de resented her\nimputations, and Blakeney had been unable to help her.\n\nA wave of morbid introspection swept over her soul. She realised in a\nmoment how petty and base had been her thoughts and how purposeless her\nactions. She would have given her life at this moment to eradicate from\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's mind the knowledge of her own jealousy; she hoped that at\nleast he had not guessed her love.\n\nShe tried to read his thoughts, but in the dark passage, only dimly\nlighted by the candles in D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's room beyond, she could not see the\nexpression of his face, but the hand which held hers was warm and\ntender. She felt herself pitied, and blushed at the thought. With a\nhasty good-night she fled down the passage, and locked herself in her\nroom, alone with her own thoughts at last.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nDenunciation.\n\n\nBut what of Juliette?\n\nWhat of this wild, passionate, romantic creature tortured by a Titanic\nconflict? She, but a girl, scarcely yet a woman, torn by the greatest\nantagonistic powers that ever fought for a human soul. On the one side\nduty, tradition, her dead brother, her father--above all, her religion\nand the oath she had sworn before God; on the other justice and honour,\na case of right and wrong, honesty and pity.\n\nHow she fought with these powers now!\n\nShe fought with them, struggled with them on her knees. She tried to\ncrush memory, tried to forget that awful midnight scene ten years ago,\nher brother's dead body, her father's avenging hand holding her own, as\nhe begged her to do that, which he was too feeble, too old to\naccomplish.\n\nHis words rang in her ears from across that long vista of the past.\n\n\"Before the face of Almighty God, who sees and hears me, I swear ...\"\n\nAnd she had repeated those words loudly and of her own free will, with\nher hand resting on her brother's breast, and God Himself looking down\nupon her, for she had called upon Him to listen.\n\n\"I swear that I will seek out Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, and in any manner which\nGod may dictate to me encompass his death, his ruin, or dishonour in\nrevenge for my brother's death. May my brother's soul remain in torment\nuntil the final Judgment Day if I should break my oath, but may it rest\nin eternal peace, the day on which his death is fitly avenged.\"\n\nAlmost it seemed to her as if father and brother were standing by her\nside, as she knelt and prayed.--Oh! how she prayed!\n\nIn many ways she was only a child. All her years had been passed in\nconfinement, either beside her dying father or, later, between the four\nwalls of the Ursuline Convent. And during those years her soul had been\nfed on a contemplative, ecstatic religion, a kind of sanctified\nsuperstition, which she would have deemed sacrilege to combat.\n\nHer first step into womanhood was taken with that oath upon her lips;\nsince then, with a stoical sense of duty, she had lashed herself into a\ndaily, hourly remembrance of the great mission imposed upon her.\n\nTo have neglected it would have been, to her, equal to denying God.\n\nShe had but vague ideas of the doctrinal side of religion. Purgatory was\nto her merely a word, but a word representing a real spiritual\nstate--one of expectancy, of restlessness, of sorrow. And vaguely, yet\ndeterminedly, she believed that her brother's soul suffered, because she\nhad been too weak to fulfil her oath.\n\nThe Church had not come to her rescue. The ministers of her religion\nwere scattered to the four corners of besieged, agonising France. She\nhad no one to help her, no one to comfort her. That very peaceful,\ncontemplative life she had led in the convent, only served to enhance\nher feeling of the solemnity of her mission.\n\nIt was true, it was inevitable, because it was so hard.\n\nTo the few who, throughout those troublous times, had kept a feeling of\nveneration for their religion, this religion had become one of\nabnegation and martyrdom.\n\nA spirit of uncompromising Jansenism seemed to call forth sacrifices and\nrenunciation, whereas the happy-go-lucky Catholicism of the past century\nhad only suggested an easy, flowered path, to a comfortable,\nwell-upholstered heaven.\n\nThe harder the task seemed which was set before her, the more real it\nbecame to Juliette. God, she firmly believed, had at last, after ten\nyears, shown her the way to wreak vengeance upon her brother's murderer.\nHe had brought her to this house, caused her to see and hear part of the\nconversation between Blakeney and D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, and this at the moment of\nall others, when even the semblance of a conspiracy against the Republic\nwould bring the one inevitable result in its train: disgrace first, the\nhasty mock trial, the hall of justice, and the guillotine.\n\nShe tried not to hate D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de. She wished to judge him coldly and\nimpartially, or rather to indict him before the throne of God, and to\npunish him for the crime he had committed ten years ago. Her personal\nfeelings must remain out of the question.\n\nHad Charlotte Corday considered her own sensibilities, when with her own\nhand she put an end to Marat?\n\nJuliette remained on her knees for hours. She heard Anne Mie come home,\nand D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's voice of welcome on the landing. This was perhaps the\nmost bitter moment of this awful soul conflict, for it brought to her\nmind the remembrance of those others who would suffer too, and who were\ninnocent--Madame D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and poor, crippled Anne Mie. They had done no\nwrong, and yet how heavily would they be punished!\n\nAnd then the saner judgment, the human, material code of ethics gained\nfor a while the upper hand. Juliette would rise from her knees, dry her\neyes, prepare quietly to go to bed, and to forget all about the awful,\nrelentless Fate which dragged her to the fulfilment of its will, and\nthen sink back, broken-hearted, murmuring impassioned prayers for\nforgiveness to her father, her brother, her God.\n\nThe soul was young and ardent, and it fought for abnegation, martyrdom,\nand stern duty; the body was childlike, and it fought for peace,\ncontentment, and quiet reason.\n\nThe rational body was conquered by the passionate, powerful soul.\n\nBlame not the child, for in herself she was innocent. She was but\nanother of the many victims of this cruel, mad, hysterical time, that\nspirit of relentless tyranny, forcing its doctrines upon the weak.\n\nWith the first break of dawn Juliette at last finally rose from her\nknees, bathed her burning eyes and head, tidied her hair and dress, then\nshe sat down at the table, and began to write.\n\nShe was a transformed being now, no longer a child, essentially a\nwoman--a Joan of Arc with a mission, a Charlotte Corday going to\nmartyrdom, a human, suffering, erring soul, committing a great crime for\nthe sake of an idea.\n\nShe wrote out carefully and with a steady hand the denunciation of\nCitizen-Deputy D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de which has become an historical document, and is\npreserved in the chronicles of France.\n\nYou have all seen it at the Mus\u00c3\u00a9e Carnavalet in its glass case, its\nyellow paper and faded ink revealing nothing of the soul conflict of\nwhich it was the culminating victory. The cramped, somewhat\nschoolgirlish writing is the mute, pathetic witness of one of the\nsaddest tragedies, that era of sorrow and crime has ever known:\n\n\/*\n_To the Representatives of the People now sitting in Assembly at\n the National Convention_\n\nYou trust and believe in the Representative of the people:\nCitizen-Deputy Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de. He is false, and a traitor to the\nRepublic. He is planning, and hopes to effect, the release of\nci-devant Marie Antoinette, widow of the traitor Louis Capet. Haste!\nye representatives of the people! proofs of his assertion, papers\nand plans, are still in the house of the Citizen-Deputy D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de.\nThis statement is made by one who knows.\n\n_I. The 23rd Fructidor._\n*\/\n\nWhen her letter was written she read it through carefully, made the one\nor two little corrections, which are still visible in the document, then\nfolded her missive, hid it within the folds of her kerchief, and,\nwrapping a dark cloak and hood round her, she slipped noiselessly out of\nher room.\n\nThe house was all quiet and still. She shuddered a little as the cool\nmorning air fanned her hot cheeks: it seemed like the breath of ghosts.\n\nShe ran quickly down the stairs, and as rapidly as she could, pushed\nback the heavy bolts of the front door, and slipped out into the street.\n\nAlready the city was beginning to stir. There was no time for sleep,\nwhen so much had to be done for the safety of the threatened Republic.\nAs Juliette turned her steps towards the river, she met the crowd of\nworkmen, whom France was employing for her defence.\n\nBehind her, in the Luxembourg Gardens, and all along the opposite bank\nof the river, the furnaces were already ablaze, and the smiths at work\nforging the guns.\n\nAt every step now Juliette came across the great placards, pinned to the\ntall gallows-shaped posts, which proclaim to every passing citizen, that\nthe people of France are up and in arms.\n\nRight across the Place de l'Institut a procession of market carts, laden\nwith vegetables and a little fruit, wends its way slowly towards the\ncentre of the town. They each carry tiny tricolour flags, with a Pike\nand Cap of Liberty surmounting the flagstaff.\n\nThey are good patriots the market-gardeners, who come in daily to feed\nthe starving mob of Paris, with the few handfuls of watery potatoes, and\nmiserable, vermin-eaten cabbages, which that fraternal Revolution still\nallows them to grow without hindrance.\n\nEveryone seems busy with their work this early in the morning: the\nbusiness of killing does not begin until later in the day.\n\nFor the moment Juliette can get along quite unmolested: the women and\nchildren mostly hurrying on towards the vast encampments in the\nTuileries, where lint, and bandages, and coats for the soldiers are\nmanufactured all the day.\n\nThe walls of all the houses bear the great patriotic device: \"_Libert\u00c3\u00a9,\nEgalit\u00c3\u00a9, Fraternit\u00c3\u00a9, sinon La Mort_\"; others are more political in their\nproclamation: \"_La R\u00c3\u00a9publique une et indivisible_.\"\n\nBut on the walls of the Louvre, of the great palace of whilom kings,\nwhere the Roi Soleil held his Court, and flirted with the prettiest\nwomen in France, there the new and great Republic has affixed its final\nmandate.\n\nA great poster glued to the wall bears the words: \"_La Loi concernan les\nSuspects_.\" Below the poster is a huge wooden box with a slit at the\ntop.\n\nThis is the latest invention for securing the safety of this one and\nindivisible Republic.\n\nHenceforth everyone becomes a traitor at one word of denunciation from\nan idler or an enemy, and, as in the most tyrannical days of the Spanish\nInquisition one-half of the nation was set to spy upon the other, that\nwooden box, with its slit, is put there ready to receive denunciations\nfrom one hand against another.\n\nHad Juliette paused but for the fraction of a second, had she stopped to\nread the placard setting forth this odious law, had she only reflected,\nthen she would even now have turned back, and fled from that gruesome\nbox of infamies, as she would from a dangerous and noisome reptile or\nfrom the pestilence.\n\nBut her long vigil, her prayers, her ecstatic visions of heroic martyrs\nhad now completely numbed her faculties. Her vitality, her sensibilities\nwere gone: she had become an automaton gliding to her doom, without a\nthought or a tremor.\n\nShe drew the letter from her bosom, and with a steady hand dropped it\ninto the box. The irreclaimable had now occurred. Nothing she could\nhenceforth say or do, no prayers or agonised vigils, no miracles even,\ncould undo her action or save Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de from trial and guillotine.\n\nOne or two groups of people hurrying to their work had seen her drop the\nletter into the box. A couple of small children paused, finger in mouth,\ngazing at her with inane curiosity; one woman uttered a coarse jest, all\nof them shrugged their shoulders, and passed on, on their way. Those who\nhabitually crossed this spot were used to such sights.\n\nThat wooden box, with its mouthlike slit was like an insatiable monster\nthat was constantly fed, yet was still gaping for more.\n\nHaving done the deed Juliette turned, and as rapidly as she had come, so\nshe went back to her temporary home.\n\nA home no more now; she must leave it at once, to-day if possible. This\nmuch she knew, that she no longer could touch the bread of the man she\nhad betrayed. She would not appear at breakfast, she could plead a\nheadache, and in the afternoon P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle should pack her things.\n\nShe turned into a little shop close by, and asked for a glass of milk\nand a bit of bread. The woman who served her eyed her with some\ncuriosity, for Juliette just now looked almost out of her mind.\n\nShe had not yet begun to think, and she had ceased to suffer.\n\nBoth would come presently, and with them the memory of this last\nirretrievable hour and a just estimate of what she had done.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\"Vengeance is mine.\"\n\n\nThe pretence of a headache enabled Juliette to keep in her room the\ngreater part of the day. She would have liked to shut herself out from\nthe entire world during those hours which she spent face to face with\nher own thoughts and her own sufferings.\n\nThe sight of Anne Mie's pathetic little face as she brought her food and\ndelicacies and various little comforts, was positive torture to the\npoor, harrowed soul.\n\nAt every sound in the great, silent house she started up, quivering with\napprehension and horror. Had the sword of Damocles, which she herself\nhad suspended, already fallen over the heads of those who had shown her\nnothing but kindness?\n\nShe could not think of Madame D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de or of Anne Mie without the most\nagonising, the most torturing shame.\n\nAnd what of him--the man she had so remorselessly, so ruthlessly\nbetrayed to a tribunal which would know no mercy?\n\nJuliette dared not think of him.\n\nShe had never tried to analyse her feelings with regard to him. At the\ntime of Charlotte Corday's trial, when his sonorous voice rang out in\nits pathetic appeal for the misguided woman, Juliette had given him\nungrudging admiration. She remembered now how strongly his magnetic\npersonality had roused in her a feeling of enthusiasm for the poor girl,\nwho had come from the depths of her quiet provincial home, in order to\naccomplish the horrible deed which would immortalise her name through\nall the ages to come, and cause her countrymen to proclaim her \"greater\nthan Brutus.\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de was pleading for the life of that woman, and it was his very\nappeal which had aroused Juliette's dormant energy, for the cause which\nher dead father had enjoined her not to forget. It was D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de again\nwhom she had seen but a few weeks ago, standing alone before the mob who\nwould have torn her to pieces, haranguing them on her behalf, speaking\nto them with that quiet, strong voice of his, ruling them with the rule\nof love and pity, and turning their wrath to gentleness.\n\nDid she hate him, then?\n\nSurely, surely she hated him for having thrust himself into her life,\nfor having caused her brother's death and covered her father's declining\nyears with sorrow. And, above all, she hated him--indeed, indeed it was\nhate!--for being the cause of this most hideous action of her life: an\naction to which she had been driven against her will, one of basest\ningratitude and treachery, foreign to every sentiment within her heart,\ncowardly, abject, the unconscious outcome of this strange magnetism\nwhich emanated from him and had cast a spell over her, transforming her\nindividuality and will power, and making of her an unconscious and\nautomatic instrument of Fate.\n\nShe would not speak of God's finger again: it was Fate--pagan, devilish\nFate!--the weird, shrivelled women who sit and spin their interminable\nthread. They had decreed; and Juliette, unable to fight, blind and\nbroken by the conflict, had succumbed to the Megaeras and their\nrelentless wheel.\n\nAt length silence and loneliness became unendurable. She called\nP\u00c3\u00a9tronelle, and ordered her to pack her boxes.\n\n\"We leave for England to-day\", she said curtly.\n\n\"For England?\" gasped the worthy old soul, who was feeling very happy\nand comfortable in this hospitable house, and was loth to leave it. \"So\nsoon?\"\n\n\"Why, yes; we had talked of it for some time. We cannot remain here\nalways. My cousins De Cr\u00c3\u00a9cy are there, and my aunt De Coudremont. We\nshall be among friends, P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle, if we ever get there.\"\n\n\"If we ever get there!\" sighed poor P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle; \"we have but very little\nmoney, _ma ch\u00c3\u00a9rie,_ and no passports. Have you thought of asking M.\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de for them?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" rejoined Juliette hastily; \"I'll see to the passports somehow,\nP\u00c3\u00a9tronelle. Sir Percy Blakeney is English; he'll tell me what to do.\"\n\n\"Do you know where he lives, my jewel?\"\n\n\"Yes; I heard him tell Madame D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de last night that he was lodging\nwith a provincial named Brogard at the Sign of the Cruche Cass\u00c3\u00a9e. I'll\ngo seek him, P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle; I am sure he will help me. The English are so\nresourceful and practical. He'll get us our passports, I know, and\nadvise us as to the best way to proceed. Do you stay here and get all\nour things ready. I'll not be long.\"\n\nShe took up a cloak and hood, and, throwing them over her arm, she\nslipped out of the room.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had left the house earlier in the day. She hoped that he had\nnot yet returned, and ran down the stairs quickly, so that she might go\nout unperceived.\n\nThe house was quite peaceful and still. It seemed strange to Juliette\nthat there did not hang over it some sort of pall-like presentiment of\ncoming evil.\n\nFrom the kitchen, at some little distance from the hall, Anne Mie's\nvoice was heard singing an old ditty:\n\n\/*[4]\n    \"De ta tige d\u00c3\u00a9tach\u00c3\u00a9e\n     Pauvre feuille d\u00c3\u00a9ss\u00c3\u00a9ch\u00c3\u00a9e\n     O\u00c3\u00b9 vas-tu?\"\n*\/\n\nJuliette paused a moment. An awful ache had seized her heart; her eyes\nunconsciously filled with tears, as they roamed round the walls of this\nhouse which had sheltered her so hospitably, these three weeks past.\n\nAnd now whither was she going? Like the poor, dead leaf of the song, she\nwas wastrel, torn from the parent bough, homeless, friendless, having\nturned against the one hand which, in this great time of peril, had been\nextended to her in kindness and in love.\n\nConscience was beginning to rise up against her, and that hydra-headed\ntyrant Remorse. She closed her eyes to shut out the hideous vision of\nher crime; she tried to forget this home which her treachery had\ndesecrated.\n\n\/*[4]\n    \"Je vais o\u00c3\u00b9 va toute chose\n     O\u00c3\u00b9 va la feuille de rose\n     Et la feuille de laurier,\"\n*\/\n\nsang Anne Mie plaintively.\n\nA great sob broke from Juliette's aching heart. The misery of it all was\nmore than she could bear. Ah, pity her if you can! She had fought and\nstriven, and been conquered. A girl's soul is so young, so\nimpressionable; and she had grown up with that one, awful, all-pervading\nidea of duty to accomplish, a most solemn oath to fulfil, one sworn to\nher dying father, and on the dead body of her brother. She had begged\nfor guidance, prayed for release, and the voice from above had remained\nsilent. Weak, miserable, cringing, the human soul, when torn with\nearthly passion, must look at its own strength for the fight.\n\nAnd now the end had come. That swift, scarce tangible dream of peace,\nwhich had flitted through her mind during the past few weeks, had\nvanished with the dawn, and she was left desolate, alone with her great\nsin and its lifelong expiation.\n\nScarce knowing what she did, she fell on her knees, there on that\nthreshold, which she was about to leave for ever. Fate had placed on her\nyoung shoulders a burden too heavy for her to bear.\n\n\"Juliette!\"\n\nAt first she did not move. It was his voice coming from the study behind\nher. Its magic thrilled her, as it had done that day in the Hall of\nJustice. Strong, passionate, tender, it seemed now to raise every echo\nof response in her heart. She thought it was a dream, and remained there\non her knees lest it should be dispelled.\n\nThen she heard his footsteps on the flagstones of the hall. Anne Mie's\nplaintive singing had died away in the distance. She started, and jumped\nto her feet, hastily drying her eyes. The momentary dream was dispelled,\nand she was ashamed of her weakness.\n\nHe, the cause of all her sorrows, of her sin, and of her degradation,\nhad no right to see her suffer.\n\nShe would have fled out of the house now, but it was too late. He had\ncome out of his study, and, seeing her there on her knees weeping, he\ncame quickly forward, trying, with all the innate chivalry of his\nupright nature, not to let her see that he had been a witness to her\ntears.\n\n\"You are going out, mademoiselle?\" he said courteously, as, wrapping her\ncloak around her, she was turning towards the door.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" she replied hastily; \"a small errand, I ...\"\n\n\"Is it anything I can do for you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"If ...\" he added, with visible embarrassment, \"if your errand would\nbrook a delay, might I crave the honour of your presence in my study for\na few moments?\"\n\n\"My errand brooks of no delay, Citizen D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de,\" she said as\ncomposedly as she could, \"and perhaps on my return I might ...\"\n\n\"I am leaving almost directly, mademoiselle, and I would wish to bid you\ngood-bye.\"\n\nHe stood aside to allow her to pass, either out, through the street door\nor across the hall to his study.\n\nThere had been no reproach in his voice towards the guest, who was thus\nleaving him without a word of farewell. Perhaps if there had been any,\nJuliette would have rebelled. As it was, an unconquerable magnetism\nseemed to draw her towards him, and, making an almost imperceptible sign\nof acquiescence, she glided past him into his room.\n\nThe study was dark and cool; for the room faced the west, and the\nshutters had been closed, in order to keep out the hot August sun. At\nfirst Juliette could see nothing, but she felt his presence near her, as\nhe followed her into the room, leaving the door slightly ajar.\n\n\"It is kind of you, mademoiselle,\" he said gently, \"to accede to my\nrequest, which was perhaps presumptuous. But, you see, I am leaving this\nhouse to-day, and I had a selfish longing to hear your voice bidding me\nfarewell.\"\n\nJuliette's large, burning eyes were gradually piercing the semi-gloom\naround her. She could see him distinctly now, standing close beside her,\nin an attitude of the deepest, almost reverential respect.\n\nThe study was as usual neat and tidy, denoting the orderly habits of a\nman of action and energy. On the ground there was a valise, ready\nstrapped as if for a journey, and on the top of it a bulky letter-case\nof stout pigskin, secured with a small steel lock. Juliette's eyes\nfastened upon this case with a look of fascination and of horror.\nObviously it contained D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's papers, the plans for Marie\nAntoinette's escape, the passports of which he had spoken the day before\nto his friend, Sir Percy Blakeney--the proofs, in fact, which she had\noffered to the representatives of the people, in support of her\ndenunciation of the Citizen-Deputy.\n\nAfter his request he had said nothing more. He was waiting for her to\nspeak; but her voice felt parched; it seemed to her as if hands of steel\nwere gripping her throat, smothering the words she would have longed to\nspeak.\n\n\"Will you not wish me godspeed, mademoiselle?\" he repeated gently.\n\n\"Godspeed?\" Oh! the awful irony of it all! Should God speed him to a\nmock trial and to the guillotine? He was going thither, though he did\nnot know it, and was even now trying to take the hand which had\ndeliberately sent him there.\n\nAt last she made an effort to speak, and in a toneless, even voice she\ncontrived to murmur:\n\n\"You are not going for long, Citizen-Deputy?\"\n\n\"In these times, mademoiselle,\" he replied, \"any farewell might be for\never. But I am actually going for a month to the Conciergerie, to take\ncharge of the unfortunate prisoner there.\"\n\n\"For a month!\" she repeated mechanically.\n\n\"Oh yes!\" he said, with a smile. \"You see, our present Government is\nafraid that poor Marie Antoinette will exercise her fascinations over\nany lieutenant-governor of her prison, if he remain near her long\nenough, so a new one is appointed every month. I shall be in charge\nduring this coming Vend\u00c3\u00a9miaire. I shall hope to return before the\nequinox, but--who can tell?\"\n\n\"In any case then, Citoyen D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, the farewell I bid you to-night\nwill be a very long one.\"\n\n\"A month will seem a century to me,\" he said earnestly, \"since I must\nspend it without seeing you, but ...\"\n\nHe looked long and searchingly at her. He did not understand her in her\npresent mood, so scared and wild did she seem, so unlike that girlish,\nlight-hearted self, which had made the dull old house so bright these\npast few weeks.\n\n\"But I should not dare to hope,\" he murmured, \"that a similar reason\nwould cause you to call that month a long one.\"\n\nShe turned perhaps a trifle paler than she had been hitherto, and her\neyes roamed round the room like those of a trapped hare seeking to\nescape.\n\n\"You misunderstand me, Citoyen D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de,\" she said at last hurriedly.\n\"You have all been kind--very kind--but P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle and I can no longer\ntrespass on your hospitality. We have friends in England, and many\nenemies here ...\"\n\n\"I know,\" he interrupted quietly; \"it would be the most arrant\nselfishness on my part to suggest, that you should stay here an hour\nlonger than necessary. I fear that after to-day my roof may no longer\nprove a sheltering one for you. But will you allow me to arrange for\nyour safety, as I am arranging for that of my mother and Anne Mie? My\nEnglish friend Sir Percy Blakeney, has a yacht in readiness off the\nNormandy coast. I have already seen to your passports and to all the\narrangements of your journey as far as there, and Sir Percy, or one of\nhis friends, will see you safely on board the English yacht. He has\ngiven me his promise that he will do this, and I trust him as I would\nmyself. For the journey through France, my name is a sufficient\nguarantee that you will be unmolested; and if you will allow it, my\nmother and Anne Mie will travel in your company. Then ...\"\n\n\"I pray you stop, Citizen D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de,\" she suddenly interrupted\nexcitedly. \"You must forgive me, but I cannot allow thus to make any\narrangements for me. P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle and I must do as best we can. All your\ntime and trouble should be spent for the benefit of those who have a\nclaim upon you, whilst I ...\"\n\n\"You speak unkindly, mademoiselle; there is no question of claim.\"\n\n\"And you have no right to think ...\" she continued, with a growing,\nnervous excitement, drawing her hand hurriedly away, for he had tried to\nseize it.\n\n\"Ah! pardon me,\" he interrupted earnestly, \"there you are wrong. I have\nthe right to think of you and for you--the inalienable right conferred\nupon me by my great love for you.\"\n\n\"Citizen-Deputy!\"\n\n\"Nay, Juliette; I know my folly, and I know my presumption. I know the\npride of your caste and of your party, and how much you despise the\npartisan of the squalid mob of France. Have I said that I aspired to\ngain your love? I wonder if I have ever dreamed it? I only know,\nJuliette, that you are to me something akin to the angels, something\nwhite and ethereal, intangible, and perhaps ununderstandable. Yet,\nknowing my folly, I glory in it, my dear, and I would not let you go out\nof my life without telling you of that, which has made every hour of the\npast few weeks a paradise for me--my love for you, Juliette.\"\n\nHe spoke in that low, impressive voice of his, and with those soft,\nappealing tones with which she had once heard him pleading for poor\nCharlotte Corday. Yet now he was not pleading for himself, not for his\nselfish wish or for his own happiness, only pleading for his love, that\nshe should know of it, and, knowing it, have pity in her heart for him,\nand let him serve her to the end.\n\nHe did not say anything more for a while; he had taken her hand, which\nshe no longer withdrew from him, for there was sweet pleasure in feeling\nhis strong fingers close tremblingly over hers. He pressed his lips upon\nher hand, upon the soft palm and delicate wrist, his burning kisses\nbearing witness to the tumultuous passion, which his reverence for her\nwas holding in check.\n\nShe tried to tear herself away from him, but he would not let her go:\n\n\"Do not go away just yet, Juliette,\" he pleaded. \"Think! I may never see\nyou again; but when you are far from me--in England, perhaps--amongst\nyour own kith and kin, will you try sometimes to think kindly of one who\nso wildly, so madly worships you?\"\n\nShe would have stilled, an she could, the beating of her heart, which\nwent out to him at last with all the passionate intensity of her great,\npent-up love. Every word he spoke had its echo within her very soul, and\nshe tried not to hear his tender appeal, not to see his dark head\nbending in worship before her. She tried to forget his presence, not to\nknow that he was there--he, the man whom she had betrayed to serve her\nown miserable vengeance, whom in her mad, exalted rage she had thought\nthat she hated, but whom she now knew that she loved better than her\nlife, better than her soul, her traditions, or her oath.\n\nNow, at this moment, she made every effort to conjure up the vision of\nher brother brought home dead upon a stretcher, of her father's\ndeclining years, rendered hideous by the mind unhinged through the great\nsorrow.\n\nShe tried to think of the avenging finger of God pointing the way to the\nfulfilment of her oath, and called to Him to stand by her in this\nterrible agony of her soul.\n\nAnd God spoke to her at last; through the eternal vistas of boundless\nuniverse, from that heaven which had known no pity, His voice came to\nher now, clear, awesome, and implacable:\n\n\"Vengeance is mine! I will repay!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nThe sword of Damocles.\n\n\n\"In the name of the Republic!\"\n\nAbsorbed in his thoughts, his dreams, his present happiness, D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de\nhad heard nothing of what was going on in the house, during the past few\nseconds.\n\nAt first, to Anne Mie, who was still singing her melancholy ditty over\nher work in the kitchen, there had seemed nothing unusual in the\nperemptory ring at the front-door bell. She pulled down her sleeves over\nher thin arms, smoothed down her cooking apron, then only did she run to\nsee who the visitor might be.\n\nAs soon as she had opened the door, however, she understood.\n\nFive men were standing before her, four of whom wore the uniform of the\nNational Guard, and the fifth, the tricolour scarf fringed with gold,\nwhich denoted service under the Convention.\n\nThis man seemed to be in command of the others, and he immediately\nstepped into the hall, followed by his four companions, who at a sign\nfrom him, effectively cut off Anne Mie from what had been her imminent\npurpose--namely, to run to the study and warn D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de of his danger.\n\nThat it was danger of the most certain, the most deadly kind she never\ndoubted for one moment. Even had her instinct not warned her, she would\nhave guessed. One glance at the five men had sufficed to tell her: their\nattitude, their curt word of command, their air of authority as they\ncrossed the hall--everything revealed the purpose of their visit: a\ndomiciliary search in the house of Citizen-Deputy D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de.\n\nMerlin's Law of the Suspect was in full operation. Someone had denounced\nthe Citizen-Deputy to the Committee of Public Safety; and in this year\nof grace, 1793, and I. of the Revolution, men and women were daily sent\nto the guillotine on suspicion.\n\nAnne Mie would have screamed, had she dared, but instinct such as hers\nwas far too keen, to betray her into so injudicious an act. She felt\nthat, were Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's eyes upon her at this moment, he would wish\nher to remain calm and outwardly serene.\n\nThe foremost man--he with the tricolour scarf--had already crossed the\nhall, and was standing outside the study door. It was his word of\ncommand which first roused D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de from his dream:\n\n\"In the name of the Republic!\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de did not immediately drop the small hand, which a moment ago he\nhad been covering with kisses. He held it to his lips once more, very\ngently, lingering over this last fond caress, as if over an eternal\nfarewell, then he straightened out his broad, well-knit figure, and\nturned to the door.\n\nHe was very pale, but there was neither fear nor even surprise expressed\nin his earnest, deep-set eyes. They still seemed to be looking afar,\ngazing upon a heaven-born vision, which the touch of her hand and the\navowal of his love had conjured up before him.\n\n\"In the name of the Republic!\"\n\nOnce more, for the third time--according to custom--the words rang out,\nclear, distinct, peremptory.\n\nIn that one fraction of a second, whilst those six words were spoken,\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's eyes wandered swiftly towards the heavy letter-case, which\nnow held his condemnation, and a wild, mad thought--the mere animal\ndesire to escape from danger--surged up in his brain.\n\nThe plans for the escape of Marie Antoinette, the various passports,\nworded in accordance with the possible disguises the unfortunate Queen\nmight assume--all these papers were more than sufficient proof of what\nwould be termed his treason against the Republic.\n\nHe could already hear the indictment against him, could see the filthy\nmob of Paris dancing a wild saraband round the tumbril, which bore him\ntowards the guillotine; he could hear their yells of execration, could\nfeel the insults hurled against him, by those who had most admired, most\nenvied him. And from all this he would have escaped if he could, if it\nhad not been too late.\n\nIt was but a second, or less, whilst the words were spoken outside his\ndoor, and whilst all other thoughts in him were absorbed in this one mad\ndesire for escape. He even made a movement, as if to snatch up the\nletter-case and to hide it about his person. But it was heavy and bulky;\nit would be sure to attract attention, and might bring upon him the\nadditional indignity of being forced to submit to a personal search.\n\nHe caught Juliette's eyes fixed upon him with an intensity of gaze\nwhich, in that same one mad moment, revealed to him the depths of her\nlove. Then the second's weakness was gone; he was once more quiet, firm,\nthe man of action, accustomed to meet danger boldly, to rule and to\nsubdue the most turgid mob.\n\nWith a quiet shrug of the shoulders, he dismissed all thought of the\ncompromising lettercase, and went to the door.\n\nAlready, as no reply had come to the third word of command, it had been\nthrown open from outside, and D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de found himself face to face with\nthe five men.\n\n\"Citizen Merlin!\" he said quietly, as he recognised the foremost among\nthem.\n\n\"Himself, Citizen-Deputy,\" rejoined the latter, with a sneer, \"at your\nservice.\"\n\nAnne Mie, in a remote corner of the hall, had heard the name, and felt\nher very soul sicken at its sound.\n\nMerlin! Author of that infamous Law of the Suspect which had set man\nagainst man, a father against his son, brother against brother, and\nfriend against friend, had made of every human creature a bloodhound on\nthe track of his fellowmen, dogging in order not to be dogged,\ndenouncing, spying, hounding, in order not to be denounced.\n\nAnd he, Merlin, gloried in this, the most fiendishly evil law ever\nperpetrated for the degradation of the human race.\n\nThere is that sketch of him in the Mus\u00c3\u00a9e Carnavalet, drawn just before\nhe, in his turn, went to expiate his crimes on that very guillotine,\nwhich he had sharpened and wielded so powerfully against his fellows.\nThe artist has well caught the slouchy, slovenly look of his loosely\nknit figure, his long limbs and narrow head, with the snakelike eyes and\nslightly receding chin. Like Marat, his model and prototype, Merlin\naffected dirty, ragged clothes. The real Sanscullottism, the downward\nlevelling of his fellowmen to the lowest rung of the social ladder,\npervaded every action of this noted product of the great Revolution.\n\nEven D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, whose entire soul was filled with a great,\nall-understanding pity for the weaknesses of mankind, recoiled at sight\nof this incarnation of the spirit of squalor and degradation, of all\nthat was left of the noble Utopian theories of the makers of the\nRevolution.\n\nMerlin grinned when he saw D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de standing there, calm, impassive,\nwell dressed, as if prepared to receive an honoured guest, rather than a\nsummons to submit to the greatest indignity a proud man has ever been\ncalled upon to suffer.\n\nMerlin had always hated the popular Citizen-Deputy. Friend and\nboon-companion of Marat and his gang, he had for over two years now\nexerted all the influence he possessed in order to bring D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de under\na cloud of suspicion.\n\nBut D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had the ear of the populace. No one understood as he did\nthe tone of a Paris mob; and the National Convention, ever terrified of\nthe volcano it had kindled, felt that a popular member of its assembly\nwas more useful alive than dead.\n\nBut now at last Merlin was having his way. An anonymous denunciation\nagainst D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had reached the Public Prosecutor that day. Tinville\nand Merlin were the fastest of friends, so the latter easily obtained\nthe privilege of being the first to proclaim to his hated enemy, the\nnews of his downfall.\n\nHe stood facing D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de for a moment, enjoying the present situation\nto its full. The light from the vast hall struck full upon the powerful\nfigure of the Citizen-Deputy and upon his firm, dark face and magnetic,\nrestless eyes. Behind him the study, with its closely-drawn shutters,\nappeared wrapped in gloom.\n\nMerlin turned to his men, and, still delighted with his position of a\ncat playing with a mouse, he pointed to D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, with a smile and a\nshrug of the shoulders.\n\n\"_Voyez-moi donc \u00c3\u00a7\u00c3\u00a0,_\" he said, with a coarse jest, and expectorating\ncontemptuously upon the floor, \"the aristocrat seems not to understand\nthat we are here in the name of the Republic. There is a very good\nproverb, Citizen-Deputy,\" he added, once more addressing D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de,\n\"which you seem to have forgotten, and that is that the pitcher which\ngoes too often to the well breaks at last. You have conspired against\nthe liberties of the people for the past ten years. Retribution has come\nto you at last; the people of France have come to their senses. The\nNational Convention wants to know what treason you are hatching between\nthese four walls, and it has deputed me to find out all there is to\nknow.\"\n\n\"At your service, Citizen-Deputy!\" said D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, quietly stepping\naside, in order to make way for Merlin and his men.\n\nResistance was useless, and, like all strong, determined natures, he\nknew when it was best to give in.\n\nDuring this while, Juliette had neither moved nor uttered a sound.\nLittle more than a minute had elapsed since the moment when the first\nperemptory order, to open in the name of the Republic, had sounded like\nthe tocsin through the stillness of the house. D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's kisses were\nstill hot upon her hand, his words of love were still ringing in her\nears.\n\nAnd now this awful, deadly peril, which she with her own hand had\nbrought on the man she loved!\n\nIf in one moment's anguish the soul be allowed to expiate a lifelong\nsin, then indeed did Juliette atone during this one terrible second.\n\nHer conscience, her heart, her entire being rose in revolt against her\ncrime. Her oath, her life, her final denunciation appeared before her in\nall their hideousness.\n\nAnd now it was too late.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de stood facing Merlin, his most implacable enemy. The latter was\ngiving orders to his men, preparatory to searching the house, and there,\njust on the top of the valise, lay the letter-case, obviously containing\nthose papers, to which the day before she had overheard D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de making\nallusion, whilst he spoke to his friend, Sir Percy Blakeney.\n\nAn unexplainable instinct seemed to tell her that the papers were in\nthat case. Her eyes were riveted on it, as if fascinated. An awful\nterror held her enthralled for one second more, whilst her thoughts, her\nlongings, her desires were all centred on the safety of that one thing.\n\nThe next instant she had seized it and thrown it upon the sofa. Then\nseating herself beside it, with the gesture of a queen and the grace of\na Parisienne, she had spread the ample folds of her skirts over the\ncompromising case, hiding it entirely from view.\n\nMerlin in the hall was ordering two men to stand one on each side of\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, and two more to follow him into the room. Now he entered it\nhimself, his narrow eyes trying to pierce the semi-obscurity, which was\nrendered more palpable by the brilliant light in the hall.\n\nHe had not seen Juliette's gesture, but he had heard the _frou-frou_ of\nher skirts, as she seated herself upon the sofa.\n\n\"You are not alone Citizen-Deputy, I see,\" he said, with a sneer, as his\nsnakelike eyes lighted upon the young girl.\n\n\"My guest, Citizen Merlin,\" replied D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de as calmly as he\ncould--\"Citizen Juliette Marny. I know that it is useless, under these\ncircumstances, to ask for consideration for a woman, but I pray you to\nremember, as far as is possible, that although we are all Republicans,\nwe are also Frenchmen, and all still equal in our sentiment of chivalry\ntowards our mothers, our sisters, or our guests.\"\n\nMerlin chuckled, and gazed for a moment ironically at Juliette. He had\nheld, between his talon-like fingers, that very morning, a thin scrap of\npaper, on which a schoolgirlish hand had scrawled the denunciation\nagainst Citizen-Deputy D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de.\n\nCoarse in nature, and still coarser in thoughts, this representative of\nthe people had very quickly arrived at a conclusion in his mind, with\nregard to this so-called guest in the D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de household.\n\n\"A discarded mistress,\" he muttered to himself. \"Just had another scene,\nI suppose. He's got tired of her, and she's given him away out of\nspite.\"\n\nSatisfied with this explanation of the situation, he was quite inclined\nto be amiable to Juliette. Moreover, he had caught sight of the valise,\nand almost thought that the young girl's eyes had directed his attention\ntowards it.\n\n\"Open those shutters!\" he commanded, \"this place is like a vault.\"\n\nOne of the men obeyed immediately, and as the brilliant August sun came\nstreaming into the room, Merlin once more turned to D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de.\n\n\"Information has been laid against you, Citizen-Deputy,\" he said, \"by an\nanonymous writer, who states that you have just now in your possession\ncorrespondence or other papers intended for the Widow Capet: and the\nCommittee of Public Safety has entrusted me and these citizens to seize\nsuch correspondence, and make you answerable for its presence in your\nhouse.\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de hesitated for one brief fraction of a second. As soon as the\nshutters had been opened, and the room flooded in daylight, he had at\nonce perceived that his letter-case had disappeared, and guessed, from\nJuliette's attitude upon the sofa, that she had concealed it about her\nperson. It was this which caused him to hesitate.\n\nHis heart was filled with boundless gratitude to her for her noble\neffort to save him, but he would have given his life at this moment, to\nundo what she had done.\n\nThe Terrorists were no respecters of persons or of sex. A domicillary\nsearch order, in those days, conferred full powers on those in\nauthority, and Juliette might at any moment now be peremptorily ordered\nto rise. Through her action she had made herself one with the\nCitizen-Deputy; if the case were found under the folds of her skirts,\nshe would be accused of connivance, or at any rate of the equally grave\ncharge of shielding a traitor.\n\nThe manly pride in him rebelled at the thought of owing his immediate\nsafety to a woman, yet he could not now discard her help, without\ncompromising her irretrievably.\n\nHe dared not even to look again towards her, for he felt that at this\nmoment her life as well as his own lay in the quiver of an eyelid; and\nMerlin's keen, narrow eyes were fixed upon him in eager search for a\ntremor, a flash, which might betray fear or prove an admission of guilt.\n\nJuliette sat there, calm, impassive, disdainful, and she seemed to\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de more angelic, more unattainable even than before. He could\nhave worshipped her for her heroism, her resourcefulness, her quiet\naloofness from all these coarse creatures who filled the room with the\nodour of their dirty clothes, with their rough jests, and their noisome\nsuggestions.\n\n\"Well, Citizen-Deputy,\" sneered Merlin after a while, \"you do not reply,\nI notice.\"\n\n\"The insinuation is unworthy of a reply, citizen,\" replied D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de\nquietly; \"my services to the Republic are well known. I should have\nthought that the Committee of Public Safety would disdain an anonymous\ndenunciation against a faithful servant of the people of France.\"\n\n\"The Committee of Public Safety knows its own business best,\nCitizen-Deputy,\" rejoined Merlin roughly. \"If the accusation prove a\ncalumny, so much the better for you. I presume,\" he added with a sneer,\n\"that you do not propose to offer any resistance whilst these citizens\nand I search your house.\"\n\nWithout another word D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de handed a bunch of keys to the man by his\nside. Every kind of opposition, argument even, would be worse than\nuseless.\n\nMerlin had ordered the valise and desk to be searched, and two men were\nbusy turning out the contents of both on to the floor. But the desk now\nonly contained a few private household accounts, and notes for the\nvarious speeches which D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had at various times delivered in the\nassemblies of the National Convention. Among these, a few pencil\njottings for his great defence of Charlotte Corday were eagerly seized\nupon by Merlin, and his grimy, clawlike hands fastened upon this scrap\nof paper, as upon a welcome prey.\n\nBut there was nothing else of any importance. D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de was a man of\nthought and of action, with all the enthusiasm of real conviction, but\nnone of the carelessness of a fanatic. The papers which were contained\nin the letter-case, and which he was taking with him to the\nConciergerie, he considered were necessary to the success of his plans,\notherwise he never would have kept them, and they were the only proofs\nthat could be brought up against him.\n\nThe valise itself was only packed with the few necessaries for a month's\nsojourn at the Conciergerie; and the men, under Merlin's guidance, were\nvainly trying to find something, anything that might be construed into\ntreasonable correspondence with the unfortunate prisoner there.\n\nMerlin, whilst his men were busy with the search, was sprawling in one\nof the big leather-covered chairs, on the arms of which his dirty\nfinger-nails were beating an impatient devil's tattoo. He was at no\npains to conceal the intense disappointment which he would experience,\nwere his errand to prove fruitless.\n\nHis narrow eyes every now and then wandered towards Juliette, as if\nasking for her help and guidance. She, understanding his frame of mind,\nresponded to the look. Shutting her mentality off from the coarse\nsuggestion of his attitude towards her, she played her part with\ncunning, and without flinching. With a glance here and there, she\ndirected the men in their search. D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de himself could scarcely\nrefrain from looking at her; he was puzzled, and vaguely marvelled at\nthe perfection, with which she carried through her r\u00c3\u00b4le to the end.\n\nMerlin found himself baffled.\n\nHe knew quite well that Citizen-Deputy D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de was not a man to be\nlightly dealt with. No mere suspicion or anonymous denunciation would be\nsufficient in his case, to bring him before the tribunal of the\nRevolution. Unless there were proofs--positive, irrefutable, damnable\nproofs--of Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's treachery, the Public Prosecutor would never\ndare to frame an indictment against him. The mob of Paris would rise to\ndefend its idol; the hideous hags, who plied their knitting at the foot\nof the scaffold, would tear the guillotine down, before they would allow\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de to mount it.\n\nThis was D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's stronghold: the people of Paris, whom he had loved\nthrough all their infamies, and whom he had succoured and helped in\ntheir private need; and above all the women of Paris, whose children he\nhad caused to be tended in the hospitals which he had built for\nthem--this they had not yet forgotten, and Merlin knew it. One day they\nwould forget--soon, perhaps--then they would turn on their former idol,\nand, howling, send him to his death, amidst cries of rancour and\nexecration. When that day came there would be no need to worry about\ntreason or about proofs. When the populace had forgotten all that he had\ndone, then D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de would fall.\n\nBut that time was not yet.\n\nThe men had finished ransacking the room; every scrap of paper, every\nportable article had been eagerly seized upon.\n\nMerlin, half blind with fury, had jumped to his feet.\n\n\"Search him!\" he ordered peremptorily.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de set his teeth, and made no protest, calling up every fibre of\nmoral strength within him, to aid him in submitting to this indignity.\nAt a coarse jest from Merlin, he buried his nails into the palms of his\nhand, not to strike the foulmouthed creature in the face. But he\nsubmitted, and stood impassive by, whilst the pockets of his coat were\nturned inside out by the rough hands of the soldiers.\n\nAll the while Juliette had remained silent, watching Merlin as any hawk\nwould its prey. But the Terrorist, through the very coarseness of his\nnature, was in this case completely fooled.\n\nHe knew that it was Juliette who had denounced D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, and had\nsatisfied himself as to her motive. Because he was low and brutish and\ndegraded, he never once suspected the truth, never saw in that beautiful\nyoung woman, anything of the double nature within her, of that curious,\nself-torturing, at times morbid sense of religion and of duty, at war\nwith her own upright, innately healthy disposition.\n\nThe low-born, self-degraded Terrorist had put his own construction on\nJuliette's action, and with this he was satisfied, since it answered to\nhis own estimate of the human race, the race which he was doing his best\nto bring down to the level of the beast.\n\nTherefore Merlin did not interfere with Juliette, but contented himself\nwith insinuating, by jest and action, what her share in this day's work\nhad been. To these hints D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, of course, paid no heed. For him\nJuliette was as far above political intrigue as the angels. He would as\nsoon have suspected one of the saints enshrined in Notre Dame as this\nbeautiful, almost ethereal creature, who had been sent by Heaven to\ngladden his heart and to elevate his very thought.\n\nBut Juliette understood Merlin's attitude, and guessed that her written\ndenunciation had come into his hands. Her every thought, every living\nsensation within her, was centred in this one thing: to save the man she\nloved from the consequences of her own crime against him. And for this,\neven the shadow of suspicion must be removed from him. Merlin's\niniquitous law should not touch him again.\n\nWhen D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de at last had been released, after the outrage to which he\nhad been personally subjected, Merlin was literally, and figuratively\ntoo, looking about him for an issue to his present dubious position.\n\nJudging others by his own standard of conduct, he feared now that the\npopular Citizen-Deputy would incite the mob against him, in revenge for\nthe indignities which he had had to suffer. And with it all the\nTerrorist was convinced that D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de was guilty, that proofs of his\ntreason did exist, if only he knew where to lay hands on them.\n\nHe turned to Juliette with an unexpressed query in his adder-like eyes.\nShe shrugged her shoulders, and made a gesture as if pointing towards\nthe door.\n\n\"There are other rooms in the house besides this,\" her gesture seemed to\nsay; \"try them. The proofs are there, 'tis for you to find them.\"\n\nMerlin had been standing between her and D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, so that the latter\nsaw neither query nor reply.\n\n\"You are cunning, Citizen-Deputy,\" said Merlin now, turning towards him,\n\"and no doubt you have been at pains to put your treasonable\ncorrespondence out of the way. You must understand that the Committee of\nPublic Safety will not be satisfied with a mere examination of your\nstudy,\" he added, assuming an air of ironical benevolence, \"and I\npresume you will have no objection, if I and these citizen soldiers pay\na visit to other portions of your house.\"\n\n\"As you please,\" responded D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de drily.\n\n\"You will accompany us, Citizen-Deputy,\" commanded the other curtly.\n\nThe four men of the National Guard formed themselves into line outside\nthe study door; with a peremptory nod, Merlin ordered D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de to pass\nbetween them, then he too prepared to follow. At the door he turned, and\nonce more faced Juliette.\n\n\"As for you, citizeness,\" he said, with a sudden access of viciousness\nagainst her, \"if you have brought us here on a fool's errand, it will go\nill with you, remember. Do not leave the house until our return. I may\nhave some questions to put to you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTangled meshes.\n\n\nJuliette waited a moment or two, until the footsteps of the six men died\naway up the massive oak stairs.\n\nFor the first time, since the sword of Damocles had fallen, she was\nalone with her thoughts.\n\nShe had but a few moments at her command in which to devise an issue out\nof these tangled meshes, which she had woven round the man she loved.\n\nMerlin and his men would return anon. The comedy could not be kept up\nthrough another visit from them, and while the compromising letter-case\nremained in D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's private study he was in imminent danger at the\nhands of his enemy.\n\nShe thought for a moment of concealing the case about her person, but a\nsecond's reflection showed her the futility of such a move. She had not\nseen the papers themselves; any one of them might be an absolute proof\nof D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's guilt; the correspondence might be in his handwriting.\n\nIf Merlin, furious, baffled, vicious, were to order her to be searched!\nThe horror of the indignity made her shudder, but she would have\nsubmitted to that, if thereby she could have saved D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de. But of\nthis she could not be sure until after she had looked through the\npapers, and this she had not the time to do.\n\nHer first and greatest idea was to get out of this room, his private\nstudy, with the compromising papers. Not a trace of them must be found\nhere, if he were to remain beyond suspicion.\n\nShe rose from the sofa, and peeped through the door. The hall was now\ndeserted; from the left wing of the house, on the floor above, the heavy\nfootsteps of the soldiers and Merlin's occasional brutish laugh could be\ndistinctly heard.\n\nJuliette listened for a moment, trying to understand what was happening.\nYes; they had all gone to D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's bedroom, which was on the extreme\nleft, at the end of the first-floor landing. There might be just time to\naccomplish what she had now resolved to do.\n\nAs best she could, she hid the bulky leather case in the folds of her\nskirt. It was literally neck or nothing now. If she were caught on the\nstairs by one of the men nothing could save her or--possibly--D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de.\n\nAt any rate, by remaining where she was, by leaving the events to shape\nthemselves, discovery was absolutely certain. She chose to take the\nrisk.\n\nShe slipped noiselessly out of the room and up the great oak stairs.\nMerlin and his men, busy with their search in D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's bedroom, took\nno heed of what was going on behind them; Juliette arrived on the\nlanding, and turned sharply to her right, running noiselessly along the\nthick Aubusson carpet, and thence quickly to her own room.\n\nAll this had taken less than a minute to accomplish. The very next\nmoment she heard Merlin's voice ordering one of his men to stand at\nattention on the landing, but by that time she was safe inside her room.\nShe closed the door noiselessly.\n\nP\u00c3\u00a9tronelle, who had been busy all the afternoon packing up her young\nmistress' things, had fallen asleep in an arm-chair. Unconscious of the\nterrible events which were rapidly succeeding each other in the house,\nthe worthy old soul was snoring peaceably, with her hands complacently\nfolded on her ample bosom.\n\nJuliette, for the moment, took no notice of her. As quickly and as\ndexterously as she could, she was tearing open the heavy leather case\nwith a sharp pair of scissors, and very soon its contents were scattered\nbefore her on the table.\n\nOne glance at them was sufficient to convince her that most of the\npapers would undoubtedly, if found, send D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de to the guillotine.\nMost of the correspondence was in the Citizen-Deputy's handwriting. She\nhad, of course, no time to examine it more closely, but instinct\nnaturally told her that it was of a highly compromising character.\n\nShe gathered the papers up into a heap, tearing some of them up into\nstrips; then she spread them out upon the ash-pan in front of the large\nearthenware stove, which stood in a corner of the room.\n\nUnfortunately, this was a hot day in August. Her task would have been\nfar easier if she had wished to destroy a bundle of papers in the depth\nof winter, when there was a good fire burning in the stove.\n\nBut her purpose was firm and her incentive, the greatest that has ever\nspurred mankind to heroism.\n\nRegardless of any consequences to herself, she had but the one object in\nview, to save D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de at all costs.\n\nOn the wall facing her bed, and immediately above a velvet-covered\nprie-dieu, there was a small figure of the Virgin and Child--one of\nthose quaintly pretty devices for holding holy water, which the reverent\nsuperstition of the past century rendered a necessary adjunct of every\ngirl's room.\n\nIn front of the figure a small lamp was kept perpetually burning. This\nJuliette now took between her fingers, carefully, lest the tiny flame\nshould die out. First she poured the oil over the fragments of paper in\nthe ash-pan, then with the wick she set fire to the whole compromising\ncorrespondence.\n\nThe oil helped the paper to burn quickly; the smell, or perhaps the\npresence of Juliette in the room caused worthy old P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle to wake.\n\n\"It's nothing, P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle,\" said Juliette quietly; \"only a few old\nletters I am burning. But I want to be alone for a few moments--will you\ngo down to the kitchen until I call you?\"\n\nAccustomed to do as her young mistress commanded, P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle rose\nwithout a word.\n\n\"I have finished putting away your few things, my jewel. There, there!\nwhy didn't you tell me to burn your papers for you? You have soiled your\ndear hands, and ...\"\n\n\"Sh! Sh! P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle!\" said Juliette impatiently, and gently pushing the\ngarrulous old woman towards the door. \"Run to the kitchen now quickly,\nand don't come out of it until I call you. And, P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle,\" she added,\n\"you will see soldiers about the house perhaps.\"\n\n\"Soldiers! The good God have mercy!\"\n\n\"Don't be frightened, P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle. But they may ask you questions.\"\n\n\"Questions?\"\n\n\"Yes; about me.\"\n\n\"My treasure, my jewel,\" exclaimed P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle in alarm, \"have those\ndevils ...?\"\n\n\"No, no; nothing has happened as yet, but, you know, in these times\nthere is always danger.\"\n\n\"Good God! Holy Mary! Mother of God!\"\n\n\"Nothing 'll happen if you try to keep quite calm and do exactly as I\ntell you. Go to the kitchen, and wait there until I call you. If the\nsoldiers come in and question you, if they try to frighten you, remember\nthat we have nothing to fear from men, and that our lives are in God's\nkeeping.\"\n\nAll the while that Juliette spoke, she was watching the heap of paper\nbeing gradually reduced to ashes. She tried to fan the flames as best\nshe could, but some of the correspondence was on tough paper, and was\nslow in being consumed. P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle, tearful but obedient, prepared to\nleave the room. She was overawed by her mistress' air of aloofness, the\npale face rendered ethereally beautiful by the sufferings she had gone\nthrough. The eyes glowed large and magnetic, as if in presence of\nspiritual visions beyond mortal ken; the golden hair looked like a\nsaintly halo above the white, immaculate young brow.\n\nP\u00c3\u00a9tronelle made the sign of the cross, as if she were in the presence of\na saint.\n\nAs she opened the door there was a sudden draught, and the last\nflickering flame died out in the ash-pan. Juliette, seeing that\nP\u00c3\u00a9tronelle had gone, hastily turned over the few half burnt fragments of\npaper that were left. In none of them had the writing remained legible.\nAll that was compromising to D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de was effectually reduced to dust.\nThe small wick in the lamp at the foot of the Virgin and Child had\nburned itself out for want of oil; there was no means for Juliette to\nstrike another light and to destroy what remained. The leather case was,\nof course, still there, with its sides ripped open, an indestructible\nthing.\n\nThere was nothing to be done about that. Juliette after a second's\nhesitation threw it among her dresses in the valise.\n\nThen she too went out of the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nA happy moment.\n\n\nThe search in the Citizen-Deputy's bedroom had proved as fruitless as\nthat in his study. Merlin was beginning to have vague doubts as to\nwhether he had been effectively fooled.\n\nHis manner towards D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had undergone a change. He had become suave\nand unctuous, a kind of elephantine irony pervading his laborious\nattempts at conciliation. He and the Public Prosecutor would be severely\nblamed for this day's work, if the popular Deputy, relying upon the\nsupport of the people of Paris, chose to take his revenge.\n\nIn France, in this glorious year of the Revolution, there was but one\nstep between censure and indictment. And Merlin knew it. Therefore,\nalthough he had not given up all hope of finding proofs of D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's\ntreason, although by the latter's attitude he remained quite convinced\nthat such proof did exist, he was already reckoning upon the cat's paw,\nthe sop he would offer to that Cerberus, the Committee of Public Safety,\nin exchange for his own exculpation in the matter.\n\nThis sop would be Juliette, the denunciator instead of D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de the\ndenounced.\n\nBut he was still seeking for the proofs.\n\nSomewhat changing his tactics, he had allowed D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de to join his\nmother in the living-room, and had betaken himself to the kitchen in\nsearch of Anne Mie, whom he had previously caught sight of in the hall.\nThere he also found old P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle, whom he could scare out of her wits\nto his heart's content, but from whom he was quite unable to extract any\nuseful information. P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle was too stupid to be dangerous, and Anne\nMie was too much on the alert.\n\nBut, with a vague idea that a cunning man might choose the most unlikely\nplaces for the concealment of compromising property, he was ransacking\nthe kitchen from floor to ceiling.\n\nIn the living-room D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de was doing his best to reassure his mother,\nwho, in her turn, was forcing herself to be brave, and not to show by\nher tears how deeply she feared for the safety of her son. As soon as\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had been freed from the presence of the soldiers, he had\nhastened back to his study, only to find that Juliette had gone, and\nthat the letter-case had also disappeared. Not knowing what to think,\ntrembling for the safety of the woman he adored, he was just debating\nwhether he would seek for her in her own room, when she came towards him\nacross the landing.\n\nThere seemed a halo around her now. D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de felt that she had never\nbeen so beautiful and to him so unattainable. Something told him then,\nthat at this moment she was as far away from him, as if she were an\ninhabitant of another, more ethereal planet.\n\nWhen she saw him coming towards her, she put a finger to her lips, and\nwhispered:\n\n\"Sh! sh! the papers are destroyed, burned.\"\n\n\"And I owe my safety to you!\"\n\nHe had said it with his whole soul, an infinity of gratitude filled his\nheart, a joy and pride in that she had cared for his safety.\n\nBut at his words she had grown paler than she was before. Her eyes,\nlarge, dilated, and dark, were fixed upon him with an intensity of gaze\nwhich almost startled him. He thought that she was about to faint, that\nthe emotions of the past half hour had been too much for her overstrung\nnerves. He took her hand, and gently dragged her into the living-room.\n\nShe sank into a chair, as if utterly weary and exhausted, and he,\nforgetting his danger, forgetting the world and all else besides, knelt\nat her feet, and held her hands in his.\n\nShe sat bolt upright, her great eyes still fixed upon him. At first it\nseemed as if he could not be satiated with looking at her; he felt as if\nhe had never, never really seen her. She had been a dream of beauty to\nhim ever since that awful afternoon when he had held her, half fainting,\nin his arms, and had dragged her under the shelter of his roof.\n\nFrom that hour he had worshipped her: she had cast over him the magic\nspell of her refinement, her beauty, that aroma of youth and innocence\nwhich makes such a strong appeal to the man of sentiment.\n\nHe had worshipped her and not tried to understand. He would have deemed\nit almost sacrilege to pry into the mysteries of her inner self, of that\nsecond nature in her which at times made her silent, and almost morose,\nand cast a lurid gloom over her young beauty.\n\nAnd though his love for her had grown in intensity, it had remained as\nheaven born as he deemed her to be--the love of a mortal for a saint,\nthe ecstatic adoration of a St Francis for his Madonna.\n\nSir Percy Blakeney had called D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de an idealist. He was that, in the\nstrictest sense, and Juliette had embodied all that was best in his\nidealism.\n\nIt was for the first time to-day, that he had held her hand just for a\nmoment longer than mere conventionality allowed. The first kiss on her\nfinger-tips had sent the blood rushing wildly to his heart; but he still\nworshipped her, and gazed upon her as upon a divinity.\n\nShe sat bolt upright in the chair, abandoning her small, cold hands to\nhis burning grasp.\n\nHis very senses ached with the longing to clasp her in his arms, to draw\nher to him, and to feel her pulses beat closer against his. It was\nalmost torture now to gaze upon her beauty--that small, oval face,\nalmost like a child's, the large eyes which at times had seemed to be\nblue but which now appeared to be a deep, unfathomable colour, like the\ntempestuous sea.\n\n\"Juliette!\" he murmured at last, as his soul went out to her in a\npassionate appeal for the first kiss.\n\nA shudder seemed to go through her entire frame, her very lips turned\nwhite and cold, and he, not understanding, timorous, chivalrous and\nhumble, thought that she was repelled by his ardour and frightened by a\npassion to which she was too pure to respond.\n\nNothing but that one word had been spoken--just her name, an appeal from\na strong man, overmastered at last by his boundless love--and she, poor,\nstricken soul, who had so much loved, so deeply wronged him, shuddered\nat the thought of what she might have done, had Fate not helped her to\nsave him.\n\nHalf ashamed of his passion, he bowed his dark head over her hands, and,\nonce more forcing himself to be calm now, he kissed her finger-tips\nreverently.\n\nWhen he looked up again the hard lines in her face had softened, and two\ntears were slowly trickling down her pale cheeks.\n\n\"Will you forgive me, madonna?\" he said gently. \"I am only a man and you\nare very beautiful. No--don't take your little hands away. I am quite\ncalm now, and know how one should speak to angels.\"\n\nReason, justice, rectitude--everything was urging Juliette to close her\nears to the words of love, spoken by the man whom she had betrayed. But\nwho shall blame her for listening to the sweetest sound the ears of a\nwoman can ever hear--the sound of the voice of the loved one in his\nfirst declaration of love?\n\nShe sat and listened, whilst he whispered to her those soft, endearing\nwords, of which a strong man alone possesses the enchanting secret.\n\nShe sat and listened, whilst all around her was still. Madame D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de,\nat the farther end of the room, was softly muttering a few prayers.\n\nThey were all alone these two in the mad and beautiful world, which man\nhas created for himself--the world of romance--that world more wonderful\nthan any heaven, where only those may enter who have learned the sweet\nlesson of love. D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de roamed in it at will. He had created his own\nromance, wherein he was as a humble worshipper, spending his life in the\nservice of his madonna.\n\nAnd she too forgot the earth, forgot the reality, her oath, her crime\nand its punishment, and began to think that it was good to live, good to\nlove, and good to have at her feet the one man in all the world whom she\ncould fondly worship.\n\nWho shall tell what he whispered? Enough that she listened and that she\nsmiled; and he, seeing her smile, felt happy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nDetected.\n\n\nThe opening and shutting of the door roused them both from their dreams.\n\nAnne Mie, pale, trembling, with eyes looking wild and terrified, had\nglided into the room.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had sprung to his feet. In a moment he had thrust his own\nhappiness into the background at sight of the poor child's obvious\nsuffering. He went quickly towards her, and would have spoken to her,\nbut she ran past him up to Madame D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, as if she were beside\nherself with some unexplainable terror.\n\n\"Anne Mie,\" he said firmly, \"what is it? Have those devils dared ...\"\n\nIn a moment reality had come rushing back upon him with full force, and\nbitter reproaches surged up in his heart against himself, for having in\nthis moment of selfish joy forgotten those who looked up to him for help\nand protection.\n\nHe knew the temper of the brutes who had been set upon his track, knew\nthat low-minded Merlin and his noisome ways, and blamed himself severely\nfor having left Anne Mie and P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle alone with him even for a few\nmoments.\n\nBut Anne Mie quickly reassured him.\n\n\"They have not molested us much,\" she said, speaking with a visible\neffort and enforced calmness. \"P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle and I were together, and they\nmade us open all the cupboards and uncover all the dishes. They then\nasked us many questions.\"\n\n\"Questions? Of what kind?\" asked D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de.\n\n\"About you, Paul,\" replied Anne Mie, \"and about maman, and also about\n--about the citizeness, your guest.\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de looked at her closely, vaguely wondering at the strange\nattitude of the child. She was evidently labouring under some strong\nexcitement, and in her thin, brown little hand she was clutching a piece\nof paper.\n\n\"Anne Mie! Child,\" he said very gently, \"you seem quite upset--as if\nsomething terrible had happened. What is that paper you are holding, my\ndear?\"\n\nAnne Mie gazed down upon it. She was obviously making frantic efforts to\nmaintain her self-possession.\n\nJuliette at first sight of Anne Mie seemed literally to have been turned\nto stone. She sat upright, rigid as a statue, her eyes fixed upon the\npoor, crippled girl as if upon an inexorable judge, about to pronounce\nsentence upon her of life or death.\n\nInstinct, that keen sense of coming danger which Nature sometimes gives\nto her elect, had told her that, within the next few seconds, her doom\nwould be sealed; that Fate would descend upon her, holding the sword of\nNemesis; and it was Anne Mie's tiny, half-shrivelled hand which had\nplaced that sword into the grasp of Fate.\n\n\"What is that paper? Will you let me see it, Anne Mie?\" repeated\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de.\n\n\"Citizen Merlin gave it to me just now,\" began Anne Mie more quietly;\n\"he seems very wroth at finding nothing compromising against you, Paul.\nThey were a long time in the kitchen, and now they have gone to search\nmy room and P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle's; but Merlin--oh! that awful man!--he seemed\nlike a beast infuriated with his disappointment.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"I don't know what he hoped to get out of me, for I told him that you\nnever spoke to your mother or to me about your political business, and\nthat I was not in the habit of listening at the keyholes.\"\n\n\"Yes. And ...\"\n\n\"Then he began to speak of--of our guest--but, of course, there again I\ncould tell him nothing. He seemed to be puzzled as to who had denounced\nyou. He spoke about an anonymous denunciation, which reached the Public\nProsecutor early this morning. It was written on a scrap of paper, and\nthrown into the public box, it seems, and ...\"\n\n\"It is indeed very strange,\" said D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, musing over this\nextraordinary occurrence, and still more over Anne Mie's strange\nexcitement in the telling of it. \"I never knew I had a hidden enemy. I\nwonder if I shall ever find out ...\"\n\n\"That is just what I said to Citizen Merlin,\" rejoined Anne Mie.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That I wondered if you, or--or any of us who love you, will ever find\nout who your hidden enemy might be.\"\n\n\"It was a mistake to talk so fully with such a brute, little one.\"\n\n\"I didn't say much, and I thought it wisest to humour him, as he seemed\nto wish to talk on that subject.\"\n\n\"Well? And what did he say?\"\n\n\"He laughed, and asked me if I would very much like to know.\"\n\n\"I hope you said No, Anne Mie?\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed, I said Yes,\" she retorted with sudden energy, her eyes\nfixed now upon Juliette, who still sat rigid and silent, watching every\nmovement of Anne Mie from the moment in which she began to tell her\nstory.\n\n\"Would I not wish to know who is your enemy, Paul--the creature who was\nbase and treacherous enough to attempt to deliver you into the hands of\nthose merciless villains? What wrong had you done to anyone?\"\n\n\"Sh! Hush, Anne Mie! you are too excited,\" he said, smiling now, in\nspite of himself, at the young girl's vehemence over what he thought was\nbut a trifle--the discovery of his own enemy.\n\n\"I am sorry, Paul. How can I help being excited,\" rejoined Anne Mie with\nquaint, pathetic gentleness, \"when I speak of such base treachery, as\nthat which Merlin has suggested?\"\n\n\"Well? And what did he suggest?\"\n\n\"He did more than suggest,\" whispered Anne Mie almost inaudibly; \"he\ngave me this paper--the anonymous denunciation which reached the Public\nProsecutor this morning--he thought one of us might recognise the\nhandwriting.\"\n\nThen she paused, some five steps away from D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, holding out\ntowards him the crumpled paper, which up to now she had clutched\ndeterminedly in her hand. D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de was about to take it from her, and\njust before he had turned to do so, his eyes lighted on Juliette.\n\nShe said nothing, she had merely risen instinctively, and had reached\nAnne Mie's side in less than the fraction of a second.\n\nIt was all a flash, and there was dead silence in the room, but in that\none-hundredth part of a second, D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had read guilt in the face of\nJuliette.\n\nIt was nothing but instinct, a sudden, awful, unexplainable revelation.\nHer soul seemed suddenly to stand before him in all its misery and in\nall its sin.\n\nIt was as if the fire from heaven had descended in one terrific crash,\nburying beneath its devastating flames his ideals, his happiness, and\nhis divinity. She was no longer there. His madonna had ceased to be.\n\nThere stood before him a beautiful woman, on whom he had lavished all\nthe pent-up treasures of his love, whom he had succoured, sheltered, and\nprotected, and who had repaid him thus.\n\nShe had forced an entry into his house; she had spied upon him, dogged\nhim, lied to him. The moment was too sudden, too awful for him to make\neven a wild guess at her motives. His entire life, his whole past, the\npresent, and the future, were all blotted out in this awful dispersal of\nhis most cherished dream. He had forgotten everything else save her\nappalling treachery; how could he even remember that once, long ago, in\nfair fight, he had killed her brother?\n\nShe did not even try now to hide her guilt.\n\nA look of appeal, touching in its trustfulness, went out to him, begging\nhim to spare her further shame. Perhaps she felt that love, such as his,\ncould not be killed in a flash.\n\nHis entire nature was full of pity, and to that pity she made a final\nappeal, lest she should be humiliated before Madame D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and Anne\nMie.\n\nAnd he, still under the spell of those magic moments when he had knelt\nat her feet, understood her prayer, and closing his eyes just for one\nbrief moment in order to shut out for ever that radiant vision of a pure\nangel whom he had worshipped, turned quietly to Anne Mie.\n\n\"Give me that paper, Anne Mie,\" he said coldly. \"I may perhaps recognise\nthe handwriting of my most bitter enemy.\"\n\n\"'Tis unnecessary now,\" replied Anne Mie slowly, still gazing at the\nface of Juliette, in which she too had read what she wished to read.\n\nThe paper dropped out of her hand.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de stooped to pick it up. He unfolded it, smoothed it out, and\nthen saw that it was blank.\n\n\"There is nothing written on this paper,\" he said mechanically.\n\n\"No,\" rejoined Anne Mie; \"no other words save the story of her\ntreachery.\"\n\n\"What you have done is evil and wicked, Anne Mie.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so; but I had guessed the truth, and I wished to know. God\nshowed me this way, how to do it, and how to let you know as well.\"\n\n\"The less you speak of God just now, Anne Mie, the better, I think. Will\nyou attend to maman? she seems faint and ill.\"\n\nMadame D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, silent and placid in her arm-chair, had watched the\ntragic scene before her, almost like a disinterested spectator. All her\nideas and all her thoughts had been paralysed, since the moment when the\nfirst summons at the front door had warned her of the imminence of the\nperil to her son.\n\nThe final discovery of Juliette's treachery had left her impassive.\nSince her son was in danger, she cared little as to whence that danger\nhad come.\n\nObedient to D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's wish, Anne Mie was attending to the old lady's\ncomforts. The poor, crippled girl was already feeling the terrible\nreaction of her deed.\n\nIn her childish mind she had planned this way, in which to bring the\ntraitor to shame. Anne Mie knew nothing, cared nothing, about the\nmotives which had actuated Juliette; all she knew was that a terrible\nJudas-like deed had been perpetrated against the man, on whom she\nherself had lavished her pathetic, hopeless love.\n\nAll the pent-up jealousy which had tortured her for the past three weeks\nrose up, and goaded her into unmasking her rival.\n\nNever for a moment did she doubt Juliette's guilt. The god of love may\nbe blind, tradition has so decreed it, but the demon of jealousy has a\nhundred eyes, more keen than those of the lynx.\n\nAnne Mie, pushed aside by Merlin's men when they forced their way into\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's study, had, nevertheless, followed them to the door. When\nthe curtains were drawn aside and the room filled with light, she had\nseen Juliette enthroned, apparently calm and placid, upon the sofa.\n\nIt was instinct, the instinct born of her own rejected passion, which\ncaused her to read in the beautiful girl's face all that lay hidden\nbehind the pale, impassive mask. That same second sight made her\nunderstand Merlin's hints and allusions. She caught every inflection of\nhis voice, heard everything, saw everything.\n\nAnd in the midst of her anxiety and her terrors for the man she loved,\nthere was the wild, primitive, intensely human joy at the thought of\nbringing that enthroned idol, who had stolen his love, down to earth at\nlast.\n\nAnne Mie was not clever; she was simple and childish, with no complexity\nof passions or devious ways of intellect. It was her elemental jealousy\nwhich suggested the cunning plan for the unmasking of Juliette. She\nwould make the girl cringe and fear, threaten her with discovery, and\nthrough her very terror shame her before Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de.\n\nAnd now it was all done; it had all occurred as she had planned it. Paul\nknew that his love had been wasted upon a liar and a traitor, and\nJuliette stood pale, humiliated, a veritable wreck of shamed humanity.\n\nAnne Mie had triumphed, and was profoundly, abjectly wretched in her\ntriumph. Great sobs seemed to tear at her very heart-strings. She had\npulled down Paul's idol from her pedestal, but the one look she had cast\nat his face had shown her that she had also wrecked his life.\n\nHe seemed almost old now. The earnest, restless gaze had gone from his\neyes; he was staring mutely before him, twisting between nerveless\nfingers that blank scrap of paper, which had been the means of\nannihilating his dream.\n\nAll energy of attitude, all strength of bearing, which were his chief\ncharacteristics, seemed to have gone. There was a look of complete\nblankness, of hopelessness in his listless gesture.\n\n\"How he loved her!\" sighed Anne Mie, as she tenderly wrapped the shawl\nround Madame D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's shoulders.\n\nJuliette had said nothing; it seemed as if her very life had gone out of\nher. She was a mere statue now, her mind numb, her heart dead, her very\nexistence a fragile piece of mechanism. But she was looking at\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de. That one sense in her had remained alive: her sight.\n\nShe looked and looked: and saw every passing sign of mental agony on his\nface: the look of recognition of her guilt, the bewilderment at the\nappalling crash, and now that hideous deathlike emptiness of his soul\nand mind.\n\nNever once did she detect horror or loathing. He had tried to save her\nfrom being further humiliated before his mother, but there was no hatred\nor contempt in his eyes, when he realised that she had been unmasked by\na trick.\n\nShe looked and looked, for there was no hope in her, not even despair.\nThere was nothing in her mind, nothing in her soul, but a great\npall-like blank.\n\nThen gradually, as the minutes sped on, she saw the strong soul within\nhim make a sudden fight against the darkness of his despair: the\nmovement of the fingers became less listless; the powerful, energetic\nfigure straightened itself out; remembrance of other matters, other\ninterests than his own began to lift the overwhelming burden of his\ngrief.\n\nHe remembered the letter-case containing the compromising papers. A\nvague wonder arose in him as to Juliette's motives in warding off,\nthrough her concealment of it, the inevitable moment of its discovery by\nMerlin.\n\nThe thought that her entire being had undergone a change, and that she\nnow wished to save him, never once entered his mind; if it had, he would\nhave dismissed it as the outcome of maudlin sentimentality, the conceit\nof the fop, who believes his personality to be irresistible.\n\nHis own self-torturing humility pointed but to the one conclusion: that\nshe had fooled him all along; fooled him when she sought his protection;\nfooled him when she taught him to love her; fooled him, above all, at\nthe moment when, subjugated by the intensity of his passion, he had for\none brief second ceased to worship in order to love.\n\nWhen the bitter remembrance of that moment of sweetest folly rushed back\nto his aching brain, then at last did he look up at her with one final,\nagonised look of reproach, so great, so tender, and yet so final, that\nAnne Mie, who saw it, felt as if her own heart would break with the pity\nof it all.\n\nBut Juliette had caught the look too. The tension of her nerves seemed\nsuddenly to relax. Memory rushed back upon her with tumultuous\nintensity. Very gradually her knees gave beneath her, and at last she\nknelt down on the floor before him, her golden head bent under the\nburden of her guilt and her shame.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nUnder arrest.\n\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de did not attempt to go to her.\n\nOnly presently, when the heavy footsteps of Merlin and his men were once\nmore heard upon the landing, she quietly rose to her feet.\n\nShe had accomplished her act of humiliation and repentance, there before\nthem all. She looked for the last time upon those whom she had so deeply\nwronged, and in her heart spoke an eternal farewell to that great, and\nmighty, and holy love which she had called forth and then had so\nhopelessly crushed.\n\nNow she was ready for the atonement.\n\nMerlin had already swaggered into the room. The long and arduous search\nthroughout the house had not improved either his temper or his personal\nappearance. He was more covered with grime than he had been before, and\nhis narrow forehead had almost disappeared beneath the tangled mass of\nhis ill-kempt hair, which he had perpetually tugged forward and roughed\nup in his angry impatience.\n\nOne look at his face had already told Juliette what she wished to know.\nHe had searched her room, and found the fragments of burnt paper, which\nshe had purposely left in the ash-pan.\n\nHow he would act now was the one thing of importance left for Juliette\nto ponder over. That she would not escape arrest and condemnation was at\nonce made clear to her. Merlin's look of sneering contempt, when he\nglanced towards her, had told her that.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de himself had been conscious of a feeling of intense relief when\nthe men re-entered the room. The tension had become unendurable. When he\nsaw his dethroned madonna kneel in humiliation at his feet, an\noverwhelming pain had wrenched his very heart-strings.\n\nAnd yet he could not go to her. The passionate, human nature within him\nfelt a certain proud exultation at seeing her there.\n\nShe was not above him now, she was no longer akin to the angels.\n\nHe had given no further thought to his own immediate danger. Vaguely he\nguessed that Merlin would find the leather case. Where it was he could\nnot tell; perhaps Juliette herself had handed it to the soldiers. She\nhad only hidden it for a few moments, out of impulse perhaps, fearing\nlest, at the first instant of its discovery, Merlin might betray her.\n\nHe remembered now those hints and insinuations which had gone out from\nthe Terrorist to Juliette whilst the search was being conducted in the\nstudy. At the time he had merely looked upon these as a base attempt at\ninsult, and had tortured himself almost beyond bearing, in the endeavour\nto refrain from punishing that evilmouthed creature, who dared to bandy\nwords with his madonna.\n\nBut now he understood, and felt his very soul writhing with shame at the\nremembrance of it all.\n\nOh yes; the return of Merlin and his men, the presence of these grimy,\ndegraded brutes, was welcome now. He would have wished to crowd in the\nentire world, the universe and its population, between him and his\nfallen idol.\n\nMerlin's manner towards him had lost nothing of its ironical\nbenevolence. There was even a touch of obsequiousness apparent in the\nugly face, as the representative of the people approached the popular\nCitizen-Deputy.\n\n\"Citizen-Deputy,\" began Merlin, \"I have to bring you the welcome news,\nthat we have found nothing in your house that in any way can cast\nsuspicion upon your loyalty to the Republic. My orders, however, were to\nbring you before the Committee of Public Safety, whether I had found\nproofs of your guilt or not. I have found none.\"\n\nHe was watching D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de keenly, hoping even at this eleventh hour to\ndetect a look or a sign, which would furnish him with the proofs for\nwhich he was seeking. The slightest suggestion of relief on D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's\npart, a sigh of satisfaction, would have been sufficient at this moment,\nto convince him and the Committee of Public Safety that the\nCitizen-Deputy was guilty after all.\n\nBut D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de never moved. He was sufficiently master of himself not to\nexpress either surprise or satisfaction. Yet he felt both--satisfaction\nnot for his own safety, but because of his mother and Anne Mie, whom he\nwould immediately send out of the country, out of all danger; and also\nbecause of her, of Juliette Marny, his guest, who, whatever she may have\ndone against him, had still a claim on his protection. His feeling of\nsurprise was less keen, and quite transient. Merlin had not found the\nletter-case. Juliette, stricken with tardy remorse perhaps, had\nsucceeded in concealing it. The matter had practically ceased to\ninterest him. It was equally galling to owe his betrayal or his ultimate\nsafety to her.\n\nHe kissed his mother tenderly, bidding her good-bye, and pressed Anne\nMie's timid little hand warmly between his own. He did what he could to\nreassure them, but, for their own sakes, he dared say nothing before\nMerlin, as to his plans for their safety.\n\nAfter that he was ready to follow the soldiers.\n\nAs he passed close to Juliette he bowed, and almost inaudibly whispered:\n\n\"Adieu!\"\n\nShe heard the whisper, but did not respond. Her look alone gave him the\nreply to his eternal farewell.\n\nHis footsteps and those of his escort were heard echoing down the\nstaircase, then the hall door to open and shut. Through the open window\ncame the sound of hoarse cheering as the popular Citizen-Deputy appeared\nin the street.\n\nMerlin, with two men beside him, remained under the portico; he told off\nthe other two to escort D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de as far as the Hall of Justice, where\nsat the members of the Committee of Public Safety. The Terrorist had a\nvague fear that the Citizen-Deputy would speak to the mob.\n\nAn unruly crowd of women had evidently been awaiting his appearance. The\nnews had quickly spread along the streets that Merlin, Merlin himself,\nthe ardent, bloodthirsty Jacobin, had made a descent upon Paul\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's house, escorted by four soldiers. Such an indignity, put\nupon the man they most trusted in the entire assembly of the Convention,\nhad greatly incensed the crowd. The women jeered at the soldiers as soon\nas they appeared, and Merlin dared not actually forbid D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de to\nspeak.\n\n_\"A la lanterne, vieux cr\u00c3\u00a9tin!\"_ shouted one of the women, thrusting her\nfist under Merlin's nose.\n\n\"Give the word, Citizen-Deputy,\" rejoined another, \"and we'll break his\nugly face. _Nous lui casserons la gueule!_\"\n\n\"_A la lanterne! A la lanterne!\"_\n\nOne word from D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de now would have caused an open riot, and in those\ndays self defence against the mob was construed into enmity against the\npeople.\n\nMerlin's work, too, was not yet accomplished. He had had no intention of\nescorting D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de himself; he had still important business to transact\ninside the house which he had just quitted, and had merely wished to get\nthe Citizen-Deputy well out of the way, before he went upstairs again.\n\nMoreover, he had expected something of a riot in the streets. The temper\nof the people of Paris was at fever heat just now. The hatred of the\npopulace against a certain class, and against certain individuals, was\nonly equalled by their enthusiasm in favour of others.\n\nThey had worshipped Marat for his squalor and his vices; they worshipped\nDanton for his energy and Robespierre for his calm; they worshipped\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de for his voice, his gentleness and his pity, for his care of\ntheir children and the eloquence of his speech.\n\nIt was that eloquence which Merlin feared now; but he little knew the\ntype of man he had to deal with.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's influence over the most unruly, the most vicious populace\nthe history of the world has ever known, was not obtained through\nfanning its passions. That popularity, though brilliant, is always\nephemeral. The passions of a mob will invariably turn against those who\nhave helped to rouse them. Marat did not live to see the waning of his\nstar; Danton was dragged to the guillotine by those whom he had taught\nto look upon that instrument of death as the only possible and\nunanswerable political argument; Robespierre succumbed to the orgies of\nbloodshed he himself had brought about. But D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de remained master of\nthe people of Paris for as long as he chose to exert that mastery. When\nthey listened to him they felt better, nobler, less hopelessly degraded.\n\nHe kept up in their poor, misguided hearts that last flickering sense of\nmanhood which their bloodthirsty tyrants, under the guise of Fraternity\nand Equality, were doing their best to smother.\n\nEven now, when he might have turned the temper of the small crowd\noutside his door to his own advantage, he preferred to say nothing; he\neven pacified them with a gesture.\n\nHe well knew that those whom he incited against Merlin now would, once\ntheir blood was up, probably turn against him in less than half-an-hour.\n\nMerlin, who all along had meant to return to the house, took his\nopportunity now. He allowed D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and the two men to go on ahead,\nand beat a hasty retreat back into the house, followed by the jeers of\nthe women.\n\n_\"A la lanterne, vieux cr\u00c3\u00a9tin!\"_ they shouted as soon as the hall door\nwas once more closed in their faces. A few of them began hammering\nagainst the door with their fists; then they realised that their special\nfavourite, Citizen-Deputy D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, was marching along between two\nsoldiers, as if he were a prisoner. The word went round that he was\nunder arrest, and was being taken to the Hall of Justice--a prisoner.\n\nThis was not to be. The mob of Paris had been taught that it was the\nmaster in the city, and it had learned its lesson well. For the moment\nit had chosen to take Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de under its special protection, and\nas a guard of honour to him--the women in ragged kirtles, the men with\nbare legs and stripped to the waist, the children all yelling, hooting,\nand shrieking--followed him, to see that none dared harm him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nAtonement.\n\n\nMerlin waited a while in the hall, until he heard the noise of the\nshrieking crowd gradually die away in the distance, then with a grunt of\nsatisfaction he one more mounted the stairs.\n\nAll these events outside had occurred during a very few minutes, and\nMadame D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and Anne Mie had been too anxious as to what was\nhappening in the streets, to take any notice of Juliette.\n\nThey had not dared to step out on to the balcony to see what was going\non, and, therefore, did not understand what the reopening and shutting\nof the front door had meant.\n\nThe next instant, however, Merlin's heavy, slouching footsteps on the\nstairs had caused Anne Mie to look round in alarm.\n\n\"It is only the soldiers come back for me,\" said Juliette quietly.\n\n\"For you?\"\n\n\"Yes; they are coming to take me away. I suppose they did not wish to do\nit in the presence of Mr. D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, for fear ...\"\n\nShe had no time to say more. Anne Mie was still looking at her in awed\nand mute surprise, when Merlin entered the room.\n\nIn his hand he held a leather case, all torn, and split at one end, and\na few tiny scraps of half-charred paper. He walked straight up to\nJuliette, and roughly thrust the case and papers into her face.\n\n\"These are yours?\" he said roughly.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I suppose you know where they were found?\"\n\nShe nodded quietly in reply.\n\n\"What were these papers which you burnt?\"\n\n\"Love letters.\"\n\n\"You lie!\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"As you please,\" she said curtly.\n\n\"What were these papers?\" he repeated, with a loud obscene oath which,\nhowever, had not the power to disturb the young girl's serenity.\n\n\"I have told you,\" she said: \"love letters, which I wished to burn.\"\n\n\"Who was your lover?\" he asked.\n\nThen as she did not reply he indicated the street, where cries of\n\"D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de! Vive D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de!\" still echoed from afar.\n\n\"Were the letters from him?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You had more than one lover, then?\"\n\nHe laughed, and a hideous leer seemed further to distort his ugly\ncountenance.\n\nHe thrust his face quite close to hers, and she closed her eyes, sick\nwith the horror of this contact with the degraded wretch. Even Anne Mie\nhad uttered a cry of sympathy at sight of this evil-smelling, squalid\ncreature torturing, with his close proximity, the beautiful, refined\ngirl before him.\n\nWith a rough gesture he put his clawlike hand under her delicate chin,\nforcing her to turn round and to look at him. She shuddered at the\nloathsome touch, but her quietude never forsook her for a moment.\n\nIt was into the power of wretches such as this man, that she had\nwilfully delivered the man she loved. This brutish creature's\nfamiliarity put the finishing touch to her own degradation, but it gave\nher the courage to carry through her purpose to the end.\n\n\"You had more than one lover, then?\" said Merlin, with a laugh which\nwould have pleased the devil himself. \"And you wished to send one of\nthem to the guillotine in order to make way for the other? Was that it?\"\n\n\"Was that it?\" he repeated, suddenly seizing one of her wrists, and\ngiving it a savage twist, so that she almost screamed with the pain.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied firmly.\n\n\"Do you know that you brought me here on a fool's errand?\" he asked\nviciously; \"that the Citizen-Deputy D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de cannot be sent to the\nguillotine on mere suspicion, eh? Did you know that, when you wrote out\nthat denunciation?\"\n\n\"No; I did not know.\"\n\n\"You thought we could arrest him on mere suspicion?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You knew he was Innocent?\"\n\n\"I knew it.\"\n\n\"Why did you burn your love letters?\"\n\n\"I was afraid that they would be found, and would be brought under the\nnotice of the Citizen-Deputy.\"\n\n\"A splendid combination, _ma foi!_\" said Merlin, with an oath, as he\nturned to the two other women, who sat pale and shrinking in a corner of\nthe room, not understanding what was going on, not knowing what to think\nor what to believe. They had known nothing of D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's plans for the\nescape of Marie Antoinette, they didn't know what the letter-case had\ncontained, and yet they both vaguely felt that the beautiful girl, who\nstood up so calmly before the loathsome Terrorist, was not a wanton, as\nshe tried to make out, but only misguided, mad perhaps--perhaps a\nmartyr.\n\n\"Did you know anything of this?\" queried Merlin roughly from trembling\nAnne Mie.\n\n\"Nothing,\" she replied.\n\n\"No one knew anything of my private affairs or of my private\ncorrespondence,\" said Juliette coldly; \"as you say, it was a splendid\ncombination. I had hoped that it would succeed. But I understand now\nthat Citizen-Deputy D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de is a personage of too much importance to\nbe brought to trial on mere suspicion, and my denunciation of him was\nnot based on facts.\"\n\n\"And do you know, my fine aristocrat,\" sneered Merlin viciously, \"that\nit is not wise either to fool the Committee of Public Safety, or to\ndenounce without cause one of the representatives of the people?\"\n\n\"I know,\" she rejoined quietly, \"that you, Citizen Merlin, are\ndetermined that someone shall pay for this day's blunder. You dare not\nnow attack the Citizen-Deputy, and so you must be content with me.\"\n\n\"Enough of this talk now; I have no time to bandy words with aristos,\"\nhe said roughly.\n\n\"Come now, follow the men quietly. Resistance would only aggravate your\ncase.\"\n\n\"I am quite prepared to follow you. May I speak two words to my friends\nbefore I go?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I may never be able to speak to them again.\"\n\n\"I have said No, and I mean No. Now then, forward. March! I have wasted\ntoo much time already.\"\n\nJuliette was too proud to insist any further. She had hoped, by one\nword, to soften Madame D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's and Anne Mie's heart towards her. She\ndid not know whether they believed that miserable lie which she had been\ntelling to Merlin; she only guessed that for the moment they still\nthought her the betrayer of Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de.\n\nBut that one word was not to be spoken. She would have to go forth to\nher certain trial, to her probable death, under the awful cloud, which\nshe herself had brought over her own life.\n\nShe turned quietly, and walked towards the door, where the two men\nalready stood at attention.\n\nThen it was that some heaven-born instinct seemed suddenly to guide Anne\nMie. The crippled girl was face to face with a psychological problem,\nwhich in itself was far beyond her comprehension, but vaguely she felt\nthat it was a problem. Something in Juliette's face had already caused\nher to bitterly repent her action towards her, and now, as this\nbeautiful, refined woman was about to pass from under the shelter of\nthis roof, to the cruel publicity and terrible torture of that awful\nrevolutionary tribunal, Anne Mie's whole heart went out to her in\nboundless sympathy.\n\nBefore Merlin or the men could prevent her, she had run up to Juliette,\ntaken her hand, which hung listless and cold, and kissed it tenderly.\n\nJuliette seemed to wake as if from a dream. She looked down at Anne Mie\nwith a glance of hope, almost of joy, and whispered:\n\n\"It was an oath--I swore it to my father and my dead brother. Tell him.\"\n\nAnne Mie could only nod; she could not speak, for her tears were choking\nher.\n\n\"But I'll atone--with my life. Tell him,\" whispered Juliette.\n\n\"Now then,\" shouted Merlin, \"out of the way, hunchback, unless you want\nto come along too.\"\n\n\"Forgive me,\" said Anne Mie through her tears.\n\nThen the men pushed her roughly aside. But at the door Juliette turned\nto her once more, and said:\n\n\"P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle--take care of her ...\"\n\nAnd with a firm step she followed the soldiers out of the room.\n\nPresently the front door was heard to open, then to shut with a loud\nbang, and the house in the Rue Ecole de M\u00c3\u00a9decine was left in silence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nIn the Luxembourg prison.\n\n\nJuliette was alone at last--that is to say, comparatively alone, for\nthere were too many aristocrats, too many criminals and traitors, in the\nprisons of Paris now, to allow of any seclusion of those who were about\nto be tried, condemned, and guillotined.\n\nThe young girl had been marched through the crowded streets of Paris,\nfollowed by a jeering mob, who readily recognised in the gentle,\nhigh-bred girl the obvious prey, which the Committee of Public Safety\nwas wont, from time to time to throw to the hungry hydra-headed dog of\nthe Revolution.\n\nLately the squalid spectators of the noisome spectacle on the Place de\nla Guillotine had had few of these very welcome sights: an aristocrat\n--a real, elegant, refined woman, with white hands and proud, pale\nface--mounting the steps of the same scaffold on which perished the\nvilest criminals and most degraded brutes.\n\nMadame Guillotine was, above all, catholic in her tastes, her gaunt\narms, painted blood red, were open alike to the murderer and the thief,\nthe aristocrats of ancient lineage, and the proletariat from the gutter.\n\nBut lately the executions had been almost exclusively of a political\ncharacter. The Girondins were fighting their last upon the bloody arena\nof the Revolution. One by one they fell still fighting, still preaching\nmoderation, still foretelling disaster and appealing to that people,\nwhom they had roused from one slavery, in order to throw it headlong\nunder a tyrannical yoke more brutish, more absolute than before.\n\nThere were twelve prisons in Paris then, and forty thousand in France,\nand they were all full. An entire army went round the country recruiting\nprisoners. There was no room for separate cells, no room for privacy, no\ncause or desire for the most elementary sense of delicacy.\n\nWomen, men, children--all were herded together, for one day, perhaps\ntwo, and a night or so, and then death would obliterate the petty\nannoyances, the womanly blushes caused by this sordid propinquity.\n\nDeath levelled all, erased everything.\n\nWhen Marie Antoinette mounted the guillotine she had forgotten that for\nsix weeks she practically lived day and night in the immediate\ncompanionship of a set of degraded soldiery.\n\nJuliette, as she marched through the streets between two men of the\nNational Guard, and followed by Merlin, was hooted and jeered at,\ninsulted, pelted with mud. One woman tried to push past the soldiers,\nand to strike her in the face--a woman! not thirty!--and who was\ndragging a pale, squalid little boy by the hand.\n\n\"_Crache donc sur l'aristo, voyons!_\" the woman said to this poor,\nmiserable little scrap of humanity as the soldiers pushed her roughly\naside. \"Spit on the aristocrat!\" And the child tortured its own small,\nparched mouth so that, in obedience to its mother, it might defile and\nbespatter a beautiful, innocent girl.\n\nThe soldiers laughed, and improved the occasion with another insulting\njest. Even Merlin forgot his vexation, delighted at the incident.\n\nBut Juliette had seen nothing of it all.\n\nShe was walking as in a dream. The mob did not exist for her; she heard\nneither insult nor vituperation. She did not see the evil, dirty faces\npushed now and then quite close to her; she did not feel the rough hands\nof the soldiers jostling her through the crowd: she had gone back to her\nown world of romance, where she dwelt alone now with the man she loved.\nInstead of the squalid houses of Paris, with their eternal device of\nFraternity and Equality, there were beautiful trees and shrubs of laurel\nand of roses around her, making the air fragrant with their soft,\nintoxicating perfumes; sweet voices from the land of dreams filled the\natmosphere with their tender murmur, whilst overhead a cloudless sky\nillumined this earthly paradise.\n\nShe was happy--supremely, completely happy. She had saved him from the\nconsequences of her own iniquitous crime, and she was about to give her\nlife for him, so that his safety might be more completely assured.\n\nHer love for him he would never know; now he knew only her crime, but\npresently, when she would be convicted and condemned, confronted with a\nfew scraps of burned paper and a torn letter-case, then he would know\nthat she had stood her trial, self-accused, and meant to die for him.\n\nTherefore the past few moments were now wholly hers. She had the rights\nto dwell on those few happy seconds when she listened to the avowal of\nhis love. It was ethereal, and perhaps not altogether human, but it was\nhers. She had been his divinity, his madonna; he had loved in her that,\nwhich was her truer, her better self.\n\nWhat was base in her was not truly her. That awful oath, sworn so\nsolemnly, had been her relentless tyrant; and her religion--a religion\nof superstition and of false ideals--had blinded her, and dragged her\ninto crime.\n\nShe had arrogated to herself that which was God's alone--\"Vengeance!\"\nwhich is not for man.\n\nThat through it all she should have known love, and learned its tender\nsecrets, was more than she deserved. That she should have felt his\nburning kisses on her hand was heavenly compensation for all she would\nhave to suffer.\n\nAnd so she allowed them to drag her through the sansculotte mob of\nParis, who would have torn her to pieces then and there, so as not to\ndelay the pleasure of seeing her die.\n\nThey took her to the Luxembourg, once the palace of the Medici, the home\nof proud \"Monsieur\" in the days of the Great Monarch, now a loathsome,\noverfilled prison.\n\nIt was then six o'clock in the afternoon, drawing towards the close of\nthis memorable day. She was handed over to the governor of the prison, a\nshort, thick-set man in black trousers and black-shag woollen shirt, and\nwearing a dirty red cap, with tricolour rosette on the side of his\nunkempt head.\n\nHe eyed her up and down as she passed under the narrow doorway, then\nmurmured one swift query to Merlin:\n\n\"Dangerous?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Merlin laconically.\n\n\"You understand,\" added the governor; \"we are so crowded. We ought to\nknow if individual attention is required.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Merlin, \"you will be personally responsible for this\nprisoner to the Committee of Public Safety.\"\n\n\"Any visitors allowed?\"\n\n\"Certainly not, without the special permission of the Public\nProsecutor.\"\n\nJuliette heard this brief exchange of words over her future fate.\n\nNo visitor would be allowed to see her. Well, perhaps that would be\nbest. She would have been afraid to meet D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de again, afraid to read\nin his eyes that story of his dead love, which alone might have\ndestroyed her present happiness.\n\nAnd she wished to see no one. She had a memory to dwell on--a short,\nheavenly memory. It consisted of a few words, a kiss--the last one--on\nher hand, and that passionate murmur which had escaped from his lips\nwhen he knelt at her feet:\n\n\"Juliette!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nComplexities.\n\n\nCitizen-Deputy D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had been privately interviewed by the Committee\nof Public Safety, and temporarily allowed to go free.\n\nThe brief proceedings had been quite private, the people of Paris were\nnot to know as yet that their favourite was under a cloud. When he had\nanswered all the questions put to him, and Merlin--just returned from\nhis errand at the Luxembourg Prison--had given his version of the\ndomiciliary visitation in the Citizen-Deputy's house, the latter was\nbriefly told that for the moment the Republic had no grievance against\nhim.\n\nBut he knew quite well what that meant. He would be henceforth under\nsuspicion, watched incessantly, as a mouse is by the cat, and pounced\nupon, the moment time would be considered propitious for his final\ndownfall.\n\nThe inevitable waning of his popularity would be noted by keen, jealous\neyes; and D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, with his sure knowledge of mankind and of\ncharacter, knew well enough that his popularity was bound to wane sooner\nor later, as all such ephemeral things do.\n\nIn the meanwhile, during the short respite which his enemies would leave\nhim, his one thought and duty would be to get his mother and Anne Mie\nsafely out of the country.\n\nAnd also ...\n\nHe thought of _her,_ and wondered what had happened. As he walked\nswiftly across the narrow footbridge, and reached the other side of the\nriver, the events of the past few hours rushed upon his memory with\nterrible, overwhelming force.\n\nA bitter ache filled his heart at the remembrance of her treachery. The\nbaseness of it all was so appalling. He tried to think if he had ever\nwronged her; wondered if perhaps she loved someone else, and wished\n_him_ out of her way.\n\nBut, then, he had been so humble, so unassuming in his love. He had\narrogated nothing unto himself, asked for nothing, demanded nothing in\nvirtue of his protecting powers over her.\n\nHe was torturing himself with this awful wonderment of why she had\ntreated him thus.\n\nOut of revenge for her brother's death--that was the only explanation he\ncould find, the only palliation for her crime.\n\nHe knew nothing of her oath to her father, and, of course, had never\nheard of the sad history of this young, sensitive girl placed in one\nterrible moment between her dead brother and her demented father. He\nonly thought of common, sordid revenge for a sin he had been practically\nforced to commit.\n\nAnd how he had loved her! Yes, _loved_--for that was in the past now.\n\nShe had ceased to be a saint or a madonna; she had fallen from her\npedestal so low that he could not find the way to descend and grope\nafter the fragments of his ideal.\n\nAt his own door he was met by Anne Mie in tears.\n\n\"She has gone,\" murmured the young girl. \"I feel as if I had murdered\nher.\"\n\n\"Gone? Who? Where?\" queried D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de rapidly, an icy feeling of terror\ngripping him by the heart-strings.\n\n\"Juliette has gone,\" replied Anne Mie; \"those awful brutes took her\naway.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Directly after you left. That man Merlin found some ashes and scraps of\npaper in her room ...\"\n\n\"Ashes?\"\n\n\"Yes; and a torn letter-case.\"\n\n\"Great God!\"\n\n\"She said that they were love letters, which she had been burning for\nfear you should see them.\"\n\n\"She said so? Anne Mie, Anne Mie, are you quite sure?\"\n\nIt was all so horrible, and he did not quite understand it all; his\nbrain, which was usually so keen and so active, refused him service at\nthis terrible juncture.\n\n\"Yes; I am quite sure,\" continued Anne Mie, in the midst of her tears.\n\"And oh! that awful Merlin said some dastardly things. But she persisted\nin her story, that she had--another lover. Oh, Paul, I am sure it is not\ntrue. I hated her because--because--you loved her so, and I mistrusted\nher, but I cannot believe that she was quite as base as that.\"\n\n\"No, no, child,\" he said in a toneless, miserable voice; \"she was not so\nbase as that. Tell me more of what she said.\"\n\n\"She said very little else. But Merlin asked her whether she had\ndenounced you so as to get you out of the way. He hinted that--that ...\"\n\n\"That I was her lover too?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" murmured Anne Mie.\n\nShe hardly liked to look at him; the strong face had become hard and set\nin its misery.\n\n\"And she allowed them to say all this?\" he asked at last.\n\n\"Yes. And she followed them without a murmur, as Merlin said she would\nhave to answer before the Committee of Public Safety, for having fooled\nthe representatives of the people.\"\n\n\"She'll answer for it with her life,\" murmured D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de. \"And with\nmine!\" he added half audibly.\n\nAnne Mie did not hear him; her pathetic little soul was filled with a\ngreat, an overwhelming pity of Juliette and for Paul.\n\n\"Before they took her away,\" she said, placing her thin,\ndelicate-looking hands on his arm. \"I ran to her, and bade her farewell.\nThe soldiers pushed me roughly aside; but I contrived to kiss her--and\nthen she whispered a few words to me.\"\n\n\"Yes? What were they?\"\n\n\"'It was an oath,' she said. 'I swore it to my father and to my dead\nbrother. Tell him,'\" repeated Anne Mie slowly.\n\nAn oath!\n\nNow he understood, and oh! how he pitied her. How terribly she must have\nsuffered in her poor, harassed soul when her noble, upright nature\nfought against this hideous treachery.\n\nThat she was true and brave in herself, of that D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had no doubt.\nAnd now this awful sin upon her conscience, which must be causing her\nendless misery.\n\nAnd, alas! the atonement would never free her from the load of\nself-condemnation. She had elected to pay with her life for her treason\nagainst him and his family. She would be arraigned before a tribunal\nwhich would inevitably condemn her. Oh! the pity of it all!\n\nOne moment's passionate emotion, a lifelong superstition and mistaken\nsense of duty, and now this endless misery, this terrible atonement of a\nwrong that could never be undone.\n\nAnd she had never loved him!\n\nThat was the true, the only sting which he knew now; it rankled more\nthan her sin, more than her falsehood, more than the shattering of his\nideal.\n\nWith a passionate desire for his safety, she had sacrificed herself in\norder to atone for the material evil which she had done.\n\nBut there was the wreck of his hopes and of his dreams!\n\nNever until now, when he had irretrievably lost her, did D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de\nrealise how great had been his hopes; how he had watched day after day\nfor a look in her eyes, a word from her lips, to show him that she too\n--his unattainable saint--would one day come to earth, and respond to\nhis love.\n\nAnd now and then, when her beautiful face lighted up at sight of him,\nwhen she smiled a greeting to him on his return from his work, when she\nlooked with pride and admiration on him from the public bench in the\nassemblies of the Convention--then he had begun to hope, to think, to\ndream.\n\nAnd it was all a sham! A mask to hide the terrible conflict that was\nraging within her soul, nothing more.\n\nShe did not love him, of that he felt convinced. Man like, he did not\nunderstand to the full that great and wonderful enigma, which has\npuzzled the world since primeval times: a woman's heart.\n\nThe eternal contradictions which go to make up the complex nature of an\nemotional woman were quite incomprehensible to him. Juliette had\nbetrayed him to serve her own sense of what was just and right, her\nrevenge and her oath. Therefore she did not love him.\n\nIt was logic, sound common-sense, and, aided by his own diffidence where\nwomen were concerned, it seemed to him irrefutable.\n\nTo a man like Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, a man of thought, of purpose, and of\naction, the idea of being false to the thing loved, of hate and love\nbeing interchangeable, was absolutely foreign and unbelievable. He had\nnever hated the thing he loved or loved the thing he hated. A man's\nfeelings in these respects are so much less complex, so much less\ncontradictory.\n\nWould a man betray his friend? No--never. He might betray his enemy, the\ncreature he abhorred, whose downfall would cause him joy. But his\nfriend? The very idea was repugnant, impossible to an upright nature.\n\nJuliette's ultimate access of generosity in trying to save him, when she\nwas at last brought face to face with the terrible wrong she had\ncommitted, _that_ he put down to one of those noble impulses of which he\nknew her soul to be fully capable, and even then his own diffidence\nsuggested that she did it more for the sake of his mother or for Anne\nMie rather than for him.\n\nTherefore what mattered life to him now? She was lost to him for ever,\nwhether he succeeded in snatching her from the guillotine or not. He had\nbut little hope to save her, but he would not owe his life to her.\n\nAnne Mie, seeing him wrapped in his own thoughts, had quietly withdrawn.\nHer own good sense told her already that Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's first step\nwould be to try and get his mother out of danger, and out of the\ncountry, while there was yet time.\n\nSo, without waiting for instructions, she began that same evening to\npack up her belongings and those of Madame D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de.\n\nThere was no longer any hatred in her heart against Juliette. Where Paul\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had failed to understand, there Anne Mie had already made a\nguess. She firmly believed that nothing now could save Juliette from\ndeath, and a great feeling of tenderness had crept into her heart, for\nthe woman whom she had looked upon as an enemy and a rival.\n\nShe too had learnt in those brief days the great lesson that revenge\nbelongs to God alone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nThe Cheval Borgne.\n\n\nIt was close upon midnight.\n\nThe place had become suffocatingly hot; the fumes of rank tobacco, of\nrancid butter, and of raw spirits hung like a vapour in mid-air.\n\nThe principal room in the \"Auberge du Cheval Borgne\" had been used for\nthe past five years now as the chief meeting-place of the\nultra-sansculotte party of the Republic.\n\nThe house itself was squalid and dirty, up one of those mean streets\nwhich, by their narrow way and shelving buildings, shut out sun, air,\nand light from their miserable inhabitants.\n\nThe Cheval Borgne was one of the most wretched-looking dwellings in this\nstreet of evil repute. The plaster was cracked, the walls themselves\nseemed bulging outward, preparatory to a final collapse. The ceilings\nwere low, and supported by beams black with age and dirt.\n\nAt one time it had been celebrated for its vast cellarage, which had\ncontained some rare old wines. And in the days of the Grand Monarch\nyoung bucks were wont to quit the gay salons of the ladies, in order to\nrepair to the Cheval Borgne for a night's carouse.\n\nIn those days the vast cellarage was witness of many a dark encounter,\nof many a mysterious death; could the slimy walls have told their own\ntale, it would have been one which would have put to shame the wildest\nchronicles of M. Vidoq.\n\nNow it was no longer so.\n\nThings were done in broad daylight on the Place de la R\u00c3\u00a9volution: there\nwas no need for dark, mysterious cellars, in which to accomplish deeds\nof murder and of revenge.\n\nRats and vermin of all sorts worked their way now in the underground\nportion of the building. They ate up each other, and held their orgies\nin the cellars, whilst men did the same sort of thing in the rooms\nabove.\n\nIt was a club of Equality and Fraternity. Any passer-by was at liberty\nto enter and take part in the debates, his only qualification for this\ntemporary membership being an inordinate love for Madame la Guillotine.\n\nIt was from the sordid rooms of the Cheval Borgne that most of the\ndenunciations had gone forth which led but to the one inevitable\nending--death.\n\nThey sat in conclave here, some twoscore or so at first, the rabid\npatriots of this poor, downtrodden France. They talked of Liberty\nmostly, with many oaths and curses against the tyrants, and then started\na tyranny, an autocracy, ten thousand times more awful than any wielded\nby the dissolute Bourbons.\n\nAnd this was the temple of Liberty, this dark, damp, evil-smelling\nbrothel, with is narrow, cracked window-panes, which let in but an\ninfinitesimal fraction of air, and that of the foulest, most unwholesome\nkind.\n\nThe floor was of planks roughly put together; now they were worm-eaten,\nbare, save for a thick carpet of greasy dust, which deadened the sound\nof booted feet. The place only boasted of a couple of chairs, both of\nwhich had to be propped against the wall lest they should break, and\nbring the sitter down upon the floor; otherwise a number of empty wine\nbarrels did duty for seats, and rough deal boards on broken trestles for\ntables.\n\nThere had once been a paper on the walls, now it hung down in strips,\nshowing the cracked plaster beneath. The whole place had a tone of\nyellowish-grey grime all over it, save where, in the centre of the room,\non a rough double post, shaped like the guillotine, a scarlet cap of\nLiberty gave a note of lurid colour to the dismal surroundings.\n\nOn the walls here and there the eternal device, so sublime in\nconception, so sordid in execution, recalled the aims of the so-called\nclub: \"Libert\u00c3\u00a9, Fraternit\u00c3\u00a9, Egalit\u00c3\u00a9, sinon la Mort.\"\n\nBelow the device, in one or two corners of the room, the wall was\nfurther adorned with rough charcoal sketches, mostly of an obscene\ncharacter, the work of one of the members of the club, who had chosen\nthis means of degrading his art.\n\nTo-night the assembly had been reduced to less than a score.\n\nEven according to the dictates of these apostles of Fraternity: _\"la\nguillotine va toujours\"_--the guillotine goes on always. She had become\nthe most potent factor in the machinery of government, of this great\nRevolution, and she had been daily, almost hourly fed through the\nactivity of this nameless club, which held its weird and awesome\nsittings in the dank coffee-room of the Cheval Borgne.\n\nThe number of the active members had been reduced. Like the rats in the\ncellars below, they had done away with one another, swallowed one\nanother up, torn each other to pieces in this wild rage for a Utopian\nfraternity.\n\nMarat, founder of the organisation, had been murdered by a girl's hand;\nbut Charon, Manuel, Osselin had gone the usual way, denounced by their\ncolleagues, Rabaut, Custine, Bison, who in their turn were sent to the\nguillotine by those more powerful, perhaps more eloquent, than\nthemselves.\n\nIt was merely a case of who could shout the loudest at an assembly of\nthe National Convention.\n\n_\"La guillotine va toujours!\"_\n\nAfter the death of Marat, Merlin became the most prominent member of the\nclub--he and Foucquier-Tinville, his bosom friend, Public Prosecutor,\nand the most bloodthirsty homicide of this homicidal age.\n\nBosom friend both, yet they worked against one another, undermining each\nother's popularity, whispering persistently, one against the other: \"He\nis a traitor!\" It had become just a neck-to-neck race between them\ntowards the inevitable goal--the guillotine.\n\nFoucquier-Tinville is in the ascendant for the moment. Merlin had been\ngiven a task which he had failed to accomplish. For days now, weeks\neven, the debates of this noble assembly had been chiefly concerned with\nthe downfall of Citizen-Deputy D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de. His popularity, his calm\nsecurity in the midst of this reign of terror and anarchy, had been a\nterrible thorn in the flesh of these rabid Jacobins.\n\nAnd now the climax had been reached. An anonymous denunciation had\nroused the hopes of these sanguinary patriots. It all sounded perfectly\nplausible. To try and save that traitor, Marie Antoinette, the widow of\nLouis Capet, was just the sort of scheme that would originate in the\nbrain of Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de.\n\nHe had always been at heart an aristocrat, and the feeling of chivalry\nfor a persecuted woman was only the outward signs of his secret\nadherence to the hated class.\n\nMerlin had been sent to search the Deputy's house for proofs of the\nlatter's guilt.\n\nAnd Merlin had come back empty-handed.\n\nThe arrest of a female aristo--the probable mistress of D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, who\nobviously had denounced him--was but small compensation for the failure\nof the more important capture.\n\nAs soon as Merlin joined his friends in the low, ill-lit, evil-smelling\nroom he realised at once that there was a feeling of hostility against\nhim.\n\nTinville, enthroned on one of the few chairs of which the Cheval Borgne\ncould boast, was surrounded by a group of surly adherents.\n\nOn the rough trestles a number of glasses, half filled with raw\npotato-spirit, gave the keynote to the temper of the assembly.\n\nAll those present were dressed in the black-shag spencer, the seedy\nblack breeches, and down-at-heel boots, which had become recognised as\nthe distinctive uniform of the sansculotte party. The inevitable\nPhrygian cap, with its tricolour cockade, appeared on the heads of all\nthose present, in various stages of dirt and decay.\n\nTinville had chosen to assume a sarcastic tone with regard to his whilom\nbosom friend, Merlin. Leaning both elbows on the table, he was picking\nhis teeth with a steel fork, and in the intervals of his interesting\noperation, gave forth his views on the broad principles of patriotism.\n\nThose who sat round him felt that his star was in the ascendant and\nassumed the position of satellites. Merlin as he entered had grunted a\nsullen \"Good-eve,\" and sat himself down in a remote corner of the room.\n\nHis greeting had been responded to with a few jeers and a good many\ndark, threatening looks. Tinville himself had bowed to him with mock\nsarcasm and an unpleasant leer.\n\nOne of the patriots, a huge fellow, almost a giant, with heavy, coarse\nfists and broad shoulders that obviously suggested coal-heaving, had,\nafter a few satirical observations, dragged one of the empty wine\nbarrels to Merlin's table, and sat down opposite him.\n\n\"Take care, Citizen Lenoir,\" said Tinville, with an evil laugh,\n\"Citizen-Deputy Merlin will arrest you instead of Deputy D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, whom\nhe has allowed to slip through his fingers.\"\n\n\"Nay; I've no fear,\" replied Lenoir, with an oath. \"Citizen Merlin is\ntoo much of an aristo to hurt anyone; his hands are too clean; he does\nnot care to do the dirty work of the Republic. Isn't that so, Monsieur\nMerlin?\" added the giant, with a mock bow, and emphasising the\nappellation which had fallen into complete disuse in these days of\nequality.\n\n\"My patriotism is too well known,\" said Merlin roughly, \"to fear any\nattacks from jealous enemies; and as for my search in the\nCitizen-Deputy's house this afternoon, I was told to find proofs against\nhim, and I found none.\"\n\nLenoir expectorated on the floor, crossed his dark hairy arms over the\ntable, and said quietly:\n\n\"Real patriotism, as the true Jacobin understands it, makes the proofs\nit wants and leaves nothing to chance.\"\n\nA chorus of hoarse murmurs of \"Vive la Libert\u00c3\u00a9!\" greeted this harangue\nof the burly coal-heaver.\n\nFeeling that he had gained the ear and approval of the gallery, Lenoir\nseemed, as it were, to spread himself out, to arrogate to himself the\nleadership of this band of malcontents, who, disappointed in their lust\nof D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's downfall, were ready to exult over that of Merlin.\n\n\"You were a fool, Citizen Merlin,\" said Lenoir with slow significance,\n\"not to see that the woman was playing her own game.\"\n\nMerlin had become livid under the grime on his face. With this ill-kempt\nsansculotte giant in front of him, he almost felt as if he were already\narraigned before that awful, merciless tribunal, to which he had dragged\nso many innocent victims.\n\nAlready he felt, as he sat ensconced behind a table in the far corner of\nthe room, that he was a prisoner at the bar, answering for his failure\nwith his life.\n\nHis own laws, his own theories now stood in bloody array against him.\nWas it not he who had framed the indictments against General Custine for\nhaving failed to subdue the cities of the south? against General\nWesterman and Brunet and Beauharnais for having failed and failed and\nfailed?\n\nAnd now it was his turn.\n\nThese bloodthirsty jackals had been cheated of their prey; they would\ntear him to pieces in compensation of their loss.\n\n\"How could I tell?\" he murmured roughly, \"the woman had denounced him.\"\n\nA chorus of angry derision greeted this feeble attempt at defence.\n\n\"By your own law, Citizen-Deputy Merlin,\" commented Tinville\nsarcastically, \"it is a crime against the Republic to be suspected of\ntreason. It is evident, however, that it is quite one thing to frame a\nlaw and quite another to obey it.\"\n\n\"What could I have done?\"\n\n\"Hark at the innocent!\" rejoined Lenoir, with a sneer. \"What could he\nhave done? Patriots, friends, brothers, I ask you, what could he have\ndone?\"\n\nThe giant had pushed the wine cask aside, it rolled away from under him,\nand in the fulness of his contempt for Merlin and his impotence, he\nstood up before them all, strong in his indictment against treasonable\nincapacity.\n\n\"I ask you,\" he repeated, with a loud oath, \"what any patriot would do,\nwhat you or I would have done, in the house of a man whom we all _know_\nis a traitor to the Republic? Brothers, friends, Citizen-Deputy Merlin\nfound a heap of burnt paper in a grate, he found a letter-case which had\nobviously contained important documents, and he asks us what he could\ndo!\"\n\n\"D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de is too important a man to be tried without proofs. The whole\nmob of Paris would have turned on us for having arraigned him, for\nhaving dared lay hands upon his sacred person.\"\n\n\"Without proofs? Who said there were no proofs?\" queried Lenoir.\n\n\"I found the burnt papers and torn letter-case in the woman's room. She\nowned that they were love letters, and that she had denounced D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de\nin order to be rid of him.\"\n\n\"Then let me tell you, Citizen-Deputy Merlin, that a true patriot would\nhave found those papers in D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's, and not the woman's room; that\nin the hands of a faithful servant of the Republic those documents would\nnot all have been destroyed, for he would have 'found' one letter\naddressed to the Widow Capet, which would have proved conclusively that\nCitizen-Deputy D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de was a traitor. That is what a true patriot\nwould have done--what I would have done. _Pardi!_ since D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de is so\nimportant a personage, since we must all put on kid gloves when we lay\nhands upon him, then let us fight him with other weapons. Are we\naristocrats that we should hesitate to play the part of jackal to this\ncunning fox? Citizen-Deputy Merlin, are you the son of some ci-devant\nduke or prince that you dared not _forge_ a document which would bring a\ntraitor to his doom? Nay; let me tell you, friends, that the Republic\nhas no use for curs, and calls him a traitor who allows one of her\nenemies to remain inviolate through his cowardice, his terror of that\nintangible and fleeting shadow--the wrath of a Paris mob.\"\n\nThunderous applause greeted this peroration, which had been delivered\nwith an accompaniment of violent gestures and a wealth of obscene\nepithets, quite beyond the power of the mere chronicler to render.\nLenoir had a harsh, strident voice, very high pitched, and he spoke with\na broad, provincial accent, somewhat difficult to locate, but quite\nunlike the hoarse, guttural tones of the low-class Parisian. His\nenthusiasm made him seem impressive. He looked, in his ragged,\ndust-stained clothes, the very personification of the squalid herd which\nhad driven culture, art, refinement to the scaffold in order to make way\nfor sordid vice, and satisfied lusts of hate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nA Jacobin orator.\n\n\nTinville alone had remained silent during Lenoir's impassioned speech.\nIt seemed to be his turn now to become surly. He sat picking his teeth,\nand staring moodily at the enthusiastic orator, who had so obviously\ndiverted popular feeling in his own direction. And Tinville brooked\npopularity only for himself.\n\n\"It is easy to talk now, Citizen--er--Lenoir. Is that your name? Well,\nyou are a comparative stranger here, Citizen Lenoir, and have not yet\nproved to the Republic that you can do ought else but talk.\"\n\n\"If somebody did not talk, Citizen Tinville--is that your name?\"\nrejoined Lenoir, with a sneer--\"if somebody didn't talk, nothing would\nget done. You all sit here, and condemn the Citizen-Deputy Merlin for\nbeing a fool, and I must say I am with you there, but ...\"\n\n\"_Pardi!_ tell us your 'but' citizen,\" said Tinville, for the\ncoal-heaver had paused, as if trying to collect his thoughts. He had\ndragged a wine barrel to collect his thoughts. He had dragged a wine\nbarrel close to the trestle table, and now sat astride upon it, facing\nTinville and the group of Jacobins. The flickering tallow candle behind\nhim threw into bold silhouette his square, massive head, crowned with\nits Phrygian cap, and the great breadth of his shoulders, with the\nshabby knitted spencer and low, turned-down collar.\n\nHe had long, thin hands, which were covered with successive coats of\ncoal dust, and with these he constantly made weird gestures, as if in\nthe act of gripping some live thing by the throat.\n\n\"We all know that the Deputy D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de is a traitor, eh?\" he said,\naddressing the company in general.\n\n\"We do,\" came with uniform assent from all those present.\n\n\"Then let us put it to the vote. The Ayes mean death, the Noes freedom.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay!\" came from every hoarse, parched throat; and twelve gaunt hands\nwere lifted up demanding death for Citizen-Deputy D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de.\n\n\"The Ayes have it,\" said Lenoir quietly, \"Now all we need do is to\ndecide how best to carry out our purpose.\"\n\nMerlin, very agreeably surprised to see public attention thus diverted\nfrom his own misdeeds, had gradually lost his surly attitude. He too\ndragged one of the wine barrels, which did duty for chairs, close to the\ntrestle table, and thus the members of the nameless Jacobin club made a\ncompact group, picturesque in its weird horror, its uncompromising,\nflaunting ugliness.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Tinville, who was loth to give up his position as\nleader of these extremists--\"I suppose, Citizen Lenoir, that you are in\nposition to furnish me with proofs of the Citizen-Deputy's guilt?\"\n\n\"If I furnish you with such proofs, Citizen Tinville,\" retorted the\nother, \"will you, as Public Prosecutor, carry the indictment through?\"\n\n\"It is my duty to publicly accuse those who are traitors to the\nRepublic.\"\n\n\"And you, Citizen Merlin,\" queried Lenoir, \"will you help the Republic\nto the best of your ability to be rid of a traitor?\"\n\n\"My services to the cause of our great Revolution are too well known-\"\nbegan Merlin.\n\nBut Lenoir interrupted him with impatience.\n\n\"_Pardi!_but we'll have no rhetoric now, Citizen Merlin. We all know\nthat you have blundered, and that the Republic cares little for those of\nher sons who have failed, but whilst you are still Minister of Justice\nthe people of France have need of you--for bringing _other_ traitors to\nthe guillotine.\"\n\nHe spoke this last phrase slowly and significantly, lingering on the\nword \"other,\" as if he wished its whole awesome meaning to penetrate\nwell into Merlin's brain.\n\n\"What is your advice then, Citizen Lenoir?\"\n\nApparently, by unanimous consent, the coalheaver, from some obscure\nprovince of France, had been tacitly acknowledged the leader of the\nband. Merlin, still in terror for himself, looked to him for advice;\neven Tinville was ready to be guided by him. All were at one in their\ndesire to rid themselves of D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, who by his clean living, his\naloofness from their own hideous orgies and deadly hates, seemed a\nliving reproach to them all; and they all felt that in Lenoir there must\nexist some secret dislike of the popular Citizen-Deputy, which would\ngive him a clear insight of how best to bring about his downfall.\n\n\"What is your advice?\" had been Merlin's query, and everyone there\nlistened eagerly for what was to come.\n\n\"We are all agreed,\" commenced Lenoir quietly, \"that just at this moment\nit would be unwise to arraign the Citizen-Deputy without material proof.\nThe mob of Paris worship him, and would turn against those who had tried\nto dethrone their idol. Now, Citizen Merlin failed to furnish us with\nproofs of D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's guilt. For the moment he is a free man, and I\nimagine a wise one; within two days he will have quitted this country,\nwell knowing that, if he stayed long enough to see his popularity wane,\nhe would also outstay his welcome on earth altogether.\"\n\n\"Ay! Ay!\" said some of the men approvingly, whilst others laughed\nhoarsely at the weird jest.\n\n\"I propose, therefore,\" continued Lenoir after a slight pause, \"that it\nshall be Citizen-Deputy D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de himself who shall furnish to the\npeople of France proofs of his own treason against the Republic.\"\n\n\"But how? But how?\" rapid, loud and excited queries greeted this\nextraordinary suggestion from the provincial giant.\n\n\"By the simplest means imaginable,\" retorted Lenoir with imperturbable\ncalm. \"Isn't there a good proverb which our grandmothers used to quote,\nthat if you only give a man a sufficient length of rope, he is sure to\nhang himself? We'll give our aristocratic Citizen-Deputy plenty of rope,\nI'll warrant, if only our present Minister of Justice,\" he added,\nindicating Merlin, \"will help us in the little comedy which I propose\nthat we should play.\"\n\n\"Yes! Yes! Go on!\" said Merlin excitedly.\n\n\"The woman who denounced D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de--that is our trump card,\" continued\nLenoir, now waxing enthusiastic with his own scheme and his own\neloquence. \"She denounced him. Ergo, he had been her lover, whom she\nwished to be rid of--why? Not, as Citizen Merlin supposed, because he\nhad discarded her. No, no; she had another lover--she has admitted that.\nShe wished to be rid of D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de to make way for the other, because he\nwas too persistent--ergo, because he loved her.\"\n\n\"Well, and what does that prove?\" queried Tinville with dry sarcasm.\n\n\"It proves that D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, being in love with the woman, would do much\nto save her from the guillotine.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"_Pardi!_ let him try, say I,\" rejoined Lenoir placidly. \"Give him the\nrope with which to hang himself.\"\n\n\"What does he mean?\" asked one or two of the men, whose dull brains had\nnot quite as yet grasped the full meaning of this monstrous scheme.\n\n\"You don't understand what I mean, citizens; you think I am mad, or\ndrunk, or a traitor like D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de? _Eh bien!_ give me your attention\nfive minutes longer, and you shall see. Let me suppose that we have\nreached the moment when the woman--what is her name? Oh! ah! yes!\nJuliette Marny--stands in the Hall of Justice on her trial before the\nCommittee of Public Safety. Citizen Foucquier-Tinville, one of our\ngreatest patriots, reads the indictment against her: the papers\nsurreptitiously burnt, the torn, mysterious letter-case found in her\nroom. If these are presumed, in the indictment, to be treasonable\ncorrespondence with the enemies of the Republic, condemnation follows at\nonce, then the guillotine. There is no defence, no respite. The Minister\nof Justice, according to Article IX of the Law framed by himself, allows\nno advocate to those directly accused of treason. But,\" continued the\ngiant, with slow and calm impressiveness, \"in the case of ordinary,\ncivil indictments, offences against public morality or matters\npertaining to the penal code, the Minister of Justice allows the accused\nto be publicly defended. Place Juliette Marny in the dock on a\ntreasonable charge, she will be hustled out of the court in a few\nminutes, amongst a batch of other traitors, dragged back to her own\nprison, and executed in the early dawn, before D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de has had time to\nframe a plan for her safety or defence. If, then, he tries to move\nheaven and earth to rescue the woman he loves, the mob of Paris\nmay,--who knows?--take his part warmly. They are mad where D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de is\nconcerned; and we all know that two devoted lovers have ere now found\nfavour with the people of France--a curious remnant of sentimentalism, I\nsuppose--and the popular Citizen-Deputy knows better than anyone else on\nearth, how to play upon the sentimental feelings of the populace. Now,\nin the case of a penal offence, mark where the difference would be! The\nwoman Juliette Marny, arraigned for wantonness, for an offence against\npublic morals; the burnt correspondence, admitted to be the letters of a\nlover--her hatred for D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de suggesting the false denunciation. Then\nthe Minister of Justice allows an advocate to defend her. She has none\nin court; but think you D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de would not step forward, and bring all\nthe fervour of his eloquence to bear in favour of his mistress? Can you\nhear his impassioned speech on her behalf?--I can--the rope, I tell you,\ncitizens, with which he'll hang himself. Will he admit in open court\nthat the burnt correspondence was another lover's letters? No!--a\nthousand times no!--and, in the face of his emphatic denial of the\nexistence of another lover for Juliette, it will be for our clever\nPublic Prosecutor to bring him down to an admission that the\ncorrespondence was his, that it was treasonable, that she burnt them to\nsave him.\"\n\nHe paused, exhausted at last, mopping his forehead, then drinking large\ngulps of brandy to ease his parched throat.\n\nA veritable chorus of enthusiasm greeted the end of his long peroration.\nThe Machiavelian scheme, almost devilish in its cunning, in its subtle\nknowledge of human nature and of the heart-strings of a noble\norganisation like D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's, commended itself to these patriots, who\nwere thirsting for the downfall of a superior enemy.\n\nEven Tinville lost his attitude of dry sarcasm; his thin cheeks were\nglowing with the lust of the fight.\n\nAlready for the past few months, the trials before the Committee of\nPublic Safety had been dull, monotonous, uninteresting. Charlotte Corday\nhad been a happy diversion, but otherwise it had been the case of\nvarious deputies, who had held views that had become too moderate, or of\nthe generals who had failed to subdue the towns or provinces of the\nsouth.\n\nBut now this trial on the morrow--the excitement of it all, the trap\nlaid for D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, the pleasure of seeing him take the first step\ntowards his own downfall. Everyone there was eager and enthusiastic for\nthe fray. Lenoir, having spoken at such length, had now become silent,\nbut everyone else talked, and drank brandy, and hugged his own hate and\nlikely triumph.\n\nFor several hours, far into the night, the sitting was continued. Each\none of the score of members had some comment to make on Lenoir's speech,\nsome suggestion to offer.\n\nLenoir himself was the first to break up this weird gathering of human\njackals, already exulting over their prey. He bad his companions a quiet\ngood-night, then passed out into the dark street.\n\nAfter he had gone there were a few seconds of complete silence in the\ndark and sordid room, where men's ugliest passions were holding absolute\nsway. The giant's heavy footsteps echoed along the ill-paved street, and\ngradually died away in the distance.\n\nThen at last Foucquier-Tinville, the Public Prosecutor, spoke:\n\n\"And who is that man?\" he asked, addressing the assembly of patriots.\n\nMost of them did not know.\n\n\"A provincial from the north,\" said one of the men at last; \"he has been\nhere several times before now, and last year he was a fairly constant\nattendant. I believe he is a butcher by trade, and I fancy he comes from\nCalais. He was originally brought here by Citizen Brogard, who is good\npatriot enough.\"\n\nOne by one the members of this bond of Fraternity began to file out of\nthe Cheval Borgne. They nodded curt good-nights to each other, and then\nwent to their respective abodes, which surely could not be dignified\nwith the name of home.\n\nTinville remained one of the last; he and Merlin seemed suddenly to have\nburied the hatchet, which a few hours ago had threatened to destroy one\nor the other of these whilom bosom friends.\n\nTwo or three of the most ardent of these ardent extremists had gathered\nround the Public Prosecutor, and Merlin, the framer of the Law of the\nSuspect.\n\n\"What say you, citizens?\" said Tinville at last quietly. \"That man\nLenoir, meseems, is too eloquent--eh?\"\n\n\"Dangerous,\" pronounced Merlin, whilst the others nodded approval.\n\n\"But his scheme is good,\" suggested one of the men.\n\n\"And we'll avail ourselves of it,\" assented Tinville, \"but afterwards\n...\"\n\nHe paused, and once more everyone nodded approval.\n\n\"Yes; he is dangerous. We'll leave him in peace to-morrow, but\nafterwards ...\"\n\nWith a gentle hand Tinville caressed the tall double post, which stood\nin the centre of the room, and which was shaped like the guillotine. An\nevil look was on his face: the grin of a death-dealing monster, savage\nand envious. The others laughed in grim content. Merlin grunted a surly\napproval. He had no cause to love the provincial coal-heaver who had\nraised a raucous voice to threaten him.\n\nThen, nodding to one another, the last of the patriots, satisfied with\nthis night's work, passed out into the night.\n\nThe watchman was making his rounds, carrying his lantern, and shouting\nhis customary cry:\n\n\"Inhabitants of Paris, sleep quietly. Everything is in order, everything\nis at peace.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nThe close of day.\n\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had spent the whole of this same night in a wild, impassioned\nsearch for Juliette.\n\nEarlier in the day, soon after Anne Mie's revelations, he had sought out\nhis English friend, Sir Percy Blakeney, and talked over with him the\nfinal arrangements for the removal of Madame D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and Anne Mie from\nParis.\n\nThough he was a born idealist and a Utopian, Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had never\nfor a moment had any illusions with regard to his own popularity. He\nknew that at any time, and for any trivial cause, the love which the mob\nbore him would readily turn to hate. He had seen Mirabeau's popularity\nwane, La Fayette's, Desmoulin's--was it likely that _he_ alone would\nsurvive the inevitable death of so ephemeral a thing?\n\nTherefore, whilst he was in power, whilst he was loved and trusted, he\nhad, figuratively and actually, put his house in order. He had made full\npreparations for his own inevitable downfall, for that probable flight\nfrom Paris of those who were dependent upon him.\n\nHe had, as far back as a year ago, provided himself with the necessary\npassports, and bespoken with his English friend certain measures for the\nsafety of his mother and his crippled little relative. Now it was merely\na question of putting these measures into execution.\n\nWithin two hours of Juliette Marny's arrest, Madame D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and Anne\nMie had quitted the house in the Rue Ecole de M\u00c3\u00a9decine. They had but\nlittle luggage with them, and were ostensibly going into the country to\nvisit a sick cousin.\n\nThe mother of the popular Citizen-Deputy was free to travel unmolested.\nThe necessary passports which the safety of the Republic demanded were\nall in perfect order, and Madame D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and Anne Mie passed through\nthe north gate of Paris an hour before sunset, on that 24th day of\nFructidor.\n\nTheir large travelling chaise took them some distance on the North Road,\nwhere they were to meet Lord Hastings and Lord Anthony Dewhurst, two of\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel's most trusted lieutenants, who were to escort\nthem as far as the coast, and thence see them safely aboard the English\nyacht.\n\nOn that score, therefore, D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had no anxiety. His chief duty was\nto his mother and to Anne Mie, and that was now fully discharged.\n\nThen there was old P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle.\n\nEver since the arrest of her young mistress the poor old soul had been\nin a state of mind bordering on frenzy, and no amount of eloquence on\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's part would persuade her to quit Paris without Juliette.\n\n\"If my pet lamb is to die,\" she said amidst heart-broken sobs, \"then I\nhave no cause to live. Let those devils take me along too, if they want\na useless, old woman like me. But if my darling is allowed to go free,\nthen what would become of her in this awful city without me? She and I\nhave never been separated; she wouldn't know where to turn for a home.\nAnd who would cook for her and iron out her kerchiefs, I'd like to\nknow?\"\n\nReason and common sense were, of course, powerless in face of this\nsublime and heroic childishness. No one had the heart to tell the old\nwoman that the murderous dog of the Revolution seldom loosened its\nfangs, once they had closed upon a victim.\n\nAll D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de could do was to convey P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle to the old abode, which\nJuliette had quitted in order to come to him, and which had never been\nformally given up. The worthy soul, calmed and refreshed, deluded\nherself into the idea that she was waiting for the return of her young\nmistress, and became quite cheerful at sight of the familiar room.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had provided her with money and necessaries. He had but few\nremaining hopes in his heart, but among them was the firmly implanted\none that P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle was too insignificant to draw upon herself the\nterrible attention of the Committee of Public Safety.\n\nBy the nightfall he had seen the good woman safely installed. Then only\ndid he feel free.\n\nAt last he could devote himself to what seemed to him the one, the only,\naim of his life--to find Juliette.\n\nA dozen prisons in this vast Paris!\n\nOver five thousand prisoners on that night, awaiting trial, condemnation\nand death.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de at first, strong in his own power, his personality, had\nthought that the task would be comparatively easy.\n\nAt the Palais de Justice they would tell him nothing: the list of new\narrests had not yet been handled in by the commandant of Paris, Citizen\nSanterre, who classified and docketed the miserable herd of aspirants\nfor the next day's guillotine.\n\nThe lists, moreover, would not be completed until the next day, when the\ntrials of the new prisoners would already be imminent.\n\nThe work of the Committee of Public Safety was done without much delay.\n\nThen began D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's weary quest through those twelve prisons of\nParis. From the Temple to the Conciergerie, from Palais Cond\u00c3\u00a9 to the\nLuxembourg, he spent hours in the fruitless search.\n\nEverywhere the same shrug of the shoulders, the same indifferent reply\nto his eager query:\n\n\"Juliette Marny? _Inconnue._\"\n\nUnknown! She had not yet been docketed, not yet classified; she was\nstill one of that immense flock of cattle, sent in ever-increasing\nnumbers to the slaughter-house.\n\nPresently, to-morrow, after a trial which might last ten minutes, after\na hasty condemnation and quick return to prison, she would be listed as\none of the traitors, whom this great and beneficent Republic sent daily\nto the guillotine.\n\nVainly did D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de try to persuade, to entreat, to bribe. The sullen\nguardians of these twelve charnel-houses knew nothing of individual\nprisoners.\n\nBut the Citizen-Deputy was allowed to look for himself. He was conducted\nto the great vaulted rooms of the Temple, to the vast ballrooms of the\nPalais Cond\u00c3\u00a9, where herded the condemned and those still awaiting trial;\nhe was allowed to witness there the grim farcical tragedies, with which\nthe captives beguiled the few hours which separated them from death.\n\nMock trials were acted there; Tinville was mimicked; then the Place de\nla R\u00c3\u00a9volution; Samson the headsman, with a couple of inverted chairs to\nrepresent the guillotine.\n\nDaughters of dukes and princes, descendants of ancient lineage, acted in\nthese weird and ghastly comedies. The ladies, with hair bound high over\ntheir heads, would kneel before the inverted chairs, and place the\nsnowwhite necks beneath this imaginary guillotine. Speeches were\ndelivered to a mock populace, whilst a mock Santerre ordered a mock roll\nof drums to drown the last flow of eloquence of the supposed victim.\n\nOh! the horror of it all--the pity, pathos, and misery of this ghastly\nparody, in the very face of the sublimity of death!\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de shuddered when first he beheld the scene, shuddered at the\nvery thought of finding Juliette amongst these careless, laughing,\nthoughtless mimes.\n\nHis own, his beautiful Juliette, with her proud face and majestic,\nqueen-like gestures; it was a relief not to see her there.\n\n\"Juliette Marny? _Inconnue,_\" was the final word he heard about her.\n\nNo one told him that by Deputy Merlin's strictest orders she had been\nlabelled \"dangerous,\" and placed in a remote wing of the Luxembourg\nPalace, together with a few, who, like herself, were allowed to see no\none, communicate with no one.\n\nThen when the _couvre-feu_ had sounded, when all public places were\nclosed, when the night watchman had begun his rounds, D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de knew\nthat his quest for that night must remain fruitless.\n\nBut he could not rest. In and out the tortuous streets of Paris he\nroamed during the better part of that night. He was now only awaiting\nthe dawn to publicly demand the right to stand beside Juliette.\n\nA hopeless misery was in his heart, a longing for a cessation of life;\nonly one thing kept his brain active, his mind clear: the hope of saving\nJuliette.\n\nThe dawn was breaking in the far east when, wandering along the banks of\nthe river, he suddenly felt a touch on his arm.\n\n\"Come to my hovel,\" said a pleasant, lazy voice close to his ear, whilst\na kindly hand seemed to drag him away from the contemplation of the\ndark, silent river. \"And a demmed, beastly place it is too, but at least\nwe can talk quietly there.\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, roused from his meditation, looked up, to see his friend, Sir\nPercy Blakeney, standing close beside him. Tall, d\u00c3\u00a9bonnair,\nwell-dressed, he seemed by his very presence to dissipate the morbid\natmosphere which was beginning to weigh upon D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's active mind.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de followed him readily enough through the intricate mazes of\nold Paris, and down the Rue des Arts, until Sir Percy stopped outside a\nsmall hostelry, the door of which stood wide open.\n\n\"Mine host has nothing to lose from footpads and thieves,\" explained the\nEnglishman as he guided his friend through the narrow doorway, then up a\nflight of rickety stairs, to a small room on the floor above. \"He leaves\nall doors open for anyone to walk in, but, la! the interior of the house\nlooks so uninviting that no one is tempted to enter.\"\n\n\"I wonder you care to stay here,\" remarked D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, with a momentary\nsmile, as he contrasted in his mind the fastidious appearance of his\nfriend with the dinginess and dirt of these surroundings.\n\nSir Percy deposited his large person in the capacious depths of a creaky\nchair, stretched his long limbs out before him, and said quietly:\n\n\"I am only staying in this demmed hole until the moment when I can drag\nyou out of this murderous city.\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de shook his head.\n\n\"You'd best go back to England, then,\" he said, \"for I'll never leave\nParis now.\"\n\n\"Not without Juliette Marny, shall we say?\" rejoined Sir Percy placidly.\n\n\"And I fear me that she has placed herself beyond our reach,\" said\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de sombrely.\n\n\"You know that she is in the Luxembourg Prison?\" queried the Englishman\nsuddenly.\n\n\"I guessed it, but could find no proof.\"\n\n\"And that she will be tried to-morrow?\"\n\n\"They never keep a prisoner pining too long,\" replied D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de\nbitterly. \"I guessed that too.\"\n\n\"What do you mean to do?\"\n\n\"Defend her with the last breath in my body.\"\n\n\"You love her still, then?\" asked Blakeney, with a smile.\n\n\"Still?\" The look, the accent, the agony of a hopeless passion conveyed\nin that one word, told Sir Percy Blakeney all that he wished to know.\n\n\"Yet she betrayed you,\" he said tentatively.\n\n\"And to atone for that sin--an oath, mind you, friend, sworn to her\nfather--she is already to give her life for me.\"\n\n\"And you are prepared to forgive?\"\n\n\"To understand _is_ to forgive,\" rejoined D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de simply, \"and I love\nher.\"\n\n\"Your madonna!\" said Blakeney, with a gently ironical smile.\n\n\"No; the woman I love, with all her weaknesses, all her sins; the woman\nto gain whom I would give my soul, to save whom I will give my life.\"\n\n\"And she?\"\n\n\"She does not love me--would she have betrayed me else?\"\n\nHe sat beside the table, and buried his head in his hands. Not even his\ndearest friend should see how much he had suffered, how deeply his love\nhad been wounded.\n\nSir Percy said nothing, a curious, pleasant smile lurked round the\ncorners of his mobile mouth. Through his mind there flitted the vision\nof beautiful Marguerite, who had so much loved yet so deeply wronged\nhim, and, looking at his friend, he thought that D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de too would\nsoon learn all the contradictions, which wage a constant war in the\ninnermost recesses of a feminine heart.\n\nHe made a movement as if he would say something more, something of grave\nimport, then seemed to think better of it, and shrugged his broad\nshoulders, as if to say:\n\n\"Let time and chance take their course now.\"\n\nWhen D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de looked up again Sir Percy was sitting placidly in the\narm-chair, with an absolutely blank expression on his face.\n\n\"Now that you know how much I love her, my friend,\" said D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de as\nsoon as he had mastered his emotions, \"will you look after her when they\nhave condemned me, and save her for my sake?\"\n\nA curious, enigmatic smile suddenly illumined Sir Percy's earnest\ncountenance.\n\n\"Save her? Do you attribute supernatural powers to me, then, or to The\nLeague of The Scarlet Pimpernel?\"\n\n\"To you, I think,\" rejoined D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de seriously.\n\nOnce more it seemed as if Sir Percy were about to reveal something of\ngreat importance to his friend, then once more he checked himself. The\nScarlet Pimpernel was, above all, far-seeing and practical, a man of\naction and not of impulse. The glowing eyes of his friend, his nervous,\nfebrile movements, did not suggest that he was in a fit state to be\nentrusted with plans, the success of which hung on a mere thread.\n\nTherefore Sir Percy only smiled, and said quietly:\n\n\"Well, I'll do my best.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nJustice.\n\n\nThe day had been an unusually busy one.\n\nFive and thirty prisoners, arraigned before the bar of the Committee of\nPublic Safety, had been tried in the last eight hours--an average of\nrather more than four to the hour; twelve minutes and a half in which to\nsend a human creature, full of life and health, to solve the great\nenigma which lies hidden beyond the waters of the Styx.\n\nAnd Citizen-Deputy Foucquier-Tinville, the Public Prosecutor, had\nsurpassed himself. He seemed indefatigable.\n\nEach of these five and thirty prisoners had been arraigned for treason\nagainst the Republic, for conspiracy with her enemies, and all had to\nhave irrefutable proofs of their guilt brought before the Committee of\nPublic Safety. Sometimes a few letters, written to friends abroad, and\nseized at the frontier; a word of condemnation of the measures of the\nextremists; and expression of horror at the massacres on the Place de la\nR\u00c3\u00a9volution, where the guillotine creaked incessantly--these were\nirrefutable proofs; or else perhaps a couple of pistols, or an old\nfamily sword seized in the house of a peaceful citizen, would be brought\nagainst a prisoner, as an irrefutable proof of his warlike dispositions\nagainst the Republic.\n\nOh! it was not difficult!\n\nOut of five and thirty indictments, Foucquier-Tinville had obtained\nthirty convictions.\n\nNo wonder his friends declared that he had surpassed himself. It had\nindeed been a glorious day, and the glow of satisfaction as much as the\nheat, caused the Public Prosecutors to mop his high, bony cranium before\nhe had adjourned for the much-needed respite for refreshment.\n\nThe day's work was not yet done.\n\nThe \"politicals\" had been disposed of, and there had been such an\naccumulation of them recently that it was difficult to keep pace with\nthe arrests.\n\nAnd in the meanwhile the criminal record of the great city had not\ndiminished. Because men butchered one another in the name of Equality,\nthere were none the fewer among the Fraternity of thieves and petty\npilferers, of ordinary cut-throats and public wantons.\n\nAnd these too had to be dealt with by law. The guillotine was impartial,\nand fell with equal velocity on the neck of the proud duke and the\ngutter-born _fille de joie,_ on a descendant of the Bourbons and the\nwastrel born in a brothel.\n\nThe ministerial decrees favoured the proletariat. A crime against the\nRepublic was indefensible, but one against the individual was dealt\nwith, with all the paraphernalia of an elaborate administration of\njustice. There were citizen judges and citizen advocates, and the\nrabble, who crowded in to listen to the trials, acted as honorary jury.\n\nIt was all thoroughly well done. The citizen criminals were given every\nchance.\n\nThe afternoon of this hot August day, one of the last of glorious\nFructidor, had begun to wane, and the shades of evening to slowly creep\ninto the long, bare room where this travesty of justice was being\nadministered.\n\nThe Citizen-President sat at the extreme end of the room, on a rough\nwooden bench, with a desk in front of him littered with papers.\n\nJust above him, on the bare, whitewashed wall, the words: \"_La\nR\u00c3\u00a9publique: une et indivisible,_\" and below them the device: \"_Libert\u00c3\u00a9,\nEgalit\u00c3\u00a9, Fraternit\u00c3\u00a9!_\"\n\nTo the right and left of the Citizen-President, four clerks were busy\nmaking entries in that ponderous ledger, that amazing record of the\nfoulest crimes the world has ever known, the \"_Bulletin du Tribunal\nR\u00c3\u00a9volutionnaire._\"\n\nAt present no one is speaking, and the grating of the clerks' quill pens\nagainst the paper is the only sound which disturbs the silence of the\nhall.\n\nIn front of the President, on a bench lower than his, sits Citizen\nFoucquier-Tinville, rested and refreshed, ready to take up his\noccupation, for as many hours as his country demands it of him.\n\nOn every desk a tallow candle, smoking and spluttering, throws a weird\nlight, and more weird shadows, on the faces of clerks and President, on\nblank walls and ominous devices.\n\nIn the centre of the room a platform surrounded by an iron railing is\nready for the accused. Just in front of it, from the tall, raftered\nceiling above, there hangs a small brass lamp, with a green _abat-jour._\n\nEach side of the long, whitewashed walls there are three rows of\nbenches, beautiful old carved oak pews, snatched from Notre Dame and\nfrom the Churches of St Eustache and St Germain l'Auxerrois. Instead of\nthe pious worshippers of mediaeval times, they now accommodate the\nlookers-on of the grim spectacle of unfortunates, in their brief halt\nbefore the scaffold.\n\nThe front row of these benches is reserved for those citizen-deputies\nwho desire to be present at the debates of the Tribunal R\u00c3\u00a9volutionnaire.\nIt is their privilege, almost their duty, as representatives of the\npeople, to see that the sittings are properly conducted.\n\nThese benches are already well filled. At one end, on the left, Citizen\nMerlin, Minister of Justice, sits; next to him Citizen-Minister Lebrun;\nalso Citizen Robespierre, still in the height of his ascendancy, and\nwatching the proceedings with those pale, watery eyes of his and that\ncurious, disdainful smile, which have earned for him the nickname of\n\"the sea-green incorruptible.\"\n\nOther well-known faces are there also, dimly outlined in the\nfast-gathering gloom. But everyone notes Citizen-Deputy D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, the\nidol of the people, as he sits on the extreme end of a bench on the\nright, with arms tightly folded across his chest, the light from the\nhanging lamp falling straight on his dark head and proud, straight\nbrows, with the large, restless, eager eyes.\n\nAnon the Citizen-President rings a hand-bell, and there is a discordant\nnoise of hoarse laughter and loud curses, some pushing, jolting, and\nswearing, as the general public is admitted into the hall.\n\nHeaven save us! What a rabble! Has humanity really such a scum?\n\nWomen with a single ragged kirtle and shift, through the interstices of\nwhich the naked, grime-covered flesh shows shamelessly: with bare legs,\nand feet thrust into heavy sabots, hair dishevelled, and evil,\nspirit-sodden faces: women without a semblance of womanhood, with\nshrivelled, barren breasts, and dry, parched lips, that have never known\nhow to kiss. Women without emotion save that of hate, without desire,\nsave for the satisfaction of hunger and thirst, and lust for revenge\nagainst their sisters less wretched, less unsexed than themselves. They\ncrowd in, jostling one another, swarming into the front rows of the\nbenches, where they can get a better view of the miserable victims about\nto be pilloried before them.\n\nAnd the men without a semblance of manhood. Bent under the heavy care of\ntheir own degradation, dead to pity, to love, to chivalry; dead to all\nsave an inordinate longing for the sight of blood.\n\nAnd God help them all! for there were the children too. Children--save\nthe mark!--with pallid, precocious little faces, pinched with the\nravages of starvation, gazing with dim, filmy eyes on this world of\nrapacity and hideousness. Children who have seen death!\n\nOh, the horror of it! Not beautiful, peaceful death, a slumber or a\ndream, a loved parent or fond sister or brother lying all in white\namidst a wealth of flowers, but death in its most awesome aspect,\nviolent, lurid, horrible.\n\nAnd now they stare around them with eager, greedy eyes, awaiting the\namusement of the spectacle; gazing at the President, with his tall\nPhrygian cap; at the clerks wielding their indefatigable quill pens,\nwriting, writing, writing; at the flickering lights, throwing clouds of\nsooty smoke, up to the dark ceiling above.\n\nThen suddenly the eyes of one little mite--a poor, tiny midget not yet\nin her teens--alight on Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's face, on the opposite side of\nthe rooms.\n\n\"_Tiens!_ Papa D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de!\" she says, pointing an attenuated little\nfinger across at him, and turning eagerly to those around her, her eyes\ndilating in wishful recollection of a happy afternoon spent in Papa\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's house, with fine white bread to eat in plenty, and great\njars of foaming milk.\n\nHe rouses himself from his apathy, and his great earnest eyes lose their\nlook of agonised misery, as he responds to the greeting of the little\none.\n\nFor one moment--oh! a mere fraction of a second--the squalid faces, the\nmiserable, starved expressions of the crowd, soften at sight of him.\nThere is a faint murmur among the women, which perhaps God's recording\nangel registered as a blessing. Who knows?\n\nFoucquier-Tinville suppresses a sneer, and the Citizen-President\nimpatiently rings his hand-bell again.\n\n\"Bring forth the accused!\" he commands in stentorian tones.\n\nThere is a movement of satisfaction among the crowd, and the angel of\nGod is forced to hide his face again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nThe trial of Juliette.\n\n\nIt is all indelibly placed on record in the \"Bulletin du Tribunal\nR\u00c3\u00a9volutionnaire,\" under date 25th Fructidor, year I. of the Revolution.\n\nAnyone who cares may read, for the Bulletin is in the Archives of the\nBiblioth\u00c3\u00a8que Nationale of Paris.\n\nOne by one the accused had been brought forth, escorted by two men of\nthe National Guard in ragged, stained uniforms of red, white, and blue;\nthey were then conducted to the small raised platform in the centre of\nthe hall, and made to listen to the charge brought against them by\nCitizen Foucquier-Tinville, the Public Presecutor.\n\nThey were petty charges mostly: pilfering, fraud, theft, occasionally\narson or manslaughter. One man, however, was arraigned for murder with\nhighway robbery, and a woman for the most ignoble traffic, which evil\nfeminine ingenuity could invent.\n\nThese two were condemned to the guillotine, the others sent to the\ngalleys at Brest or Toulon--the forger along with the petty thief, the\nhousebreaker with the absconding clerk.\n\nThere was no room in the prison for ordinary offences against the\ncriminal code; they were overfilled already with so-called traitors\nagainst the Republic.\n\nThree women were sent to the penitentiary at the Salp\u00c3\u00aatriere, and were\ndragged out of the court shrilly protesting their innocence, and\nfollowed by obscene jeers from the spectators on the benches.\n\nThen there was a momentary hush.\n\nJuliette Marny had been brought in.\n\nShe was quite calm, and exquisitely beautiful, dressed in a plain grey\nbodice and kirtle, with a black band round her slim waist and a soft\nwhite kerchief folded across her bosom. Beneath the tiny, white cap her\ngolden hair appeared in dainty, curly profusion; her child-like, oval\nface was very white, but otherwise quite serene.\n\nShe seemed absolutely unconscious of her surroundings, and walked with a\nfirm step up to the platform, looking neither to the right nor to the\nleft of her.\n\nTherefore she did not see D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de. A great, a wonderful radiance\nseemed to shine in her large eyes--the radiance of self-sacrifice.\n\nShe was offering not only her life, but everything a woman of refinement\nholds most dear, for the safety of the man she loved.\n\nA feeling that was almost physical pain, so intense was it, overcame\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, when at last he heard her name loudly called by the Public\nProsecutor.\n\nAll day he had waited for this awful moment, forgetting his own misery,\nhis own agonised feeling of an irretrievable loss, in the horrible\nthought of what _she_ would endure, what _she_ would think, when first\nshe realised the terrible indignity, which was to be put upon her.\n\nYet for the sake of her, of her chances of safety and of ultimate\nfreedom, it was undoubtedly best that it should be so.\n\nArraigned for conspiracy against the Republic, she was liable to secret\ntrial, to be brought up, condemned, and executed before he could even\nhear of her whereabouts, before he could throw himself before her judges\nand take all guilt upon himself.\n\nThose suspected of treason against the Republic forfeited, according to\nMerlin's most iniquitous Law, their rights of citizenship, in publicity\nof trial and in defence.\n\nIt all might have been finished before D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de knew anything of it.\n\nThe other way was, of course, more terrible. Brought forth amongst the\nscum of criminal Paris, on a charge, the horror of which, he could but\ndimly hope that she was too innocent to fully understand, he dared not\neven think of what she would suffer.\n\nBut undoubtedly it was better so.\n\nThe mud thrown at her robes of purity could never cling to her, and at\nleast her trial would be public; he would be there to take all infamy,\nall disgrace, all opprobrium on himself.\n\nThe strength of his appeal would turn her judges' wrath from her to him;\nand after these few moments of misery, she would be free to leave Paris,\nFrance, to be happy, and to forget him and the memory of him.\n\nAn overwhelming, all-compelling love filled his entire soul for the\nbeautiful girl, who had so wronged, yet so nobly tried to save him. A\nlonging for her made his very sinews ache; she was no longer madonna,\nand her beauty thrilled him, with the passionate, almost sensuous desire\nto give his life for her.\n\nThe indictment against Juliette Marny has become history now.\n\nOn that day, the 25th Fructidor, at seven o'clock in the evening, it was\nread out by the Public Prosecutor, and listened to by the accused--so\nthe Bulletin tells us--with complete calm and apparent indifference. She\nstood up in that same pillory where once stood poor, guilty Charlotte\nCorday, where presently would stand proud, guiltless Marie Antoinette.\n\nAnd D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de listened to the scurrilous document, with all the outward\ncalm his strength of will could command. He would have liked to rise\nfrom his seat then and there, at once, and in mad, purely animal fury\nhave, with a blow of his fist, quashed the words in Foucquier-Tinville's\nlying throat.\n\nBut for her sake he was bound to listen, and, above all, to act quietly,\ndeliberately, according to form and procedure, so as in no way to\nimperil her cause.\n\nTherefore he listened whilst the Public Prosecutor spoke.\n\n\"Juliette Marny, you are hereby accused of having, by a false and\nmalicious denunciation, slandered the person of a representative of the\npeople; you caused the Revolutionary Tribunal, through this same\nmischievous act, to bring a charge against this representative of the\npeople, to institute a domiciliary search in his house, and to waste\nvaluable time, which otherwise belonged to the service of the Republic.\nAnd this you did, not from a misguided sense of duty towards your\ncountry, but in wanton and impure spirit, to be rid of the surveillance\nof one who had your welfare at heart, and who tried to prevent your\nleading the immoral life which had become a public scandal, and which\nhas now brought you before this court of justice, to answer to a charge\nof wantonness, impurity, defamation of character, and corruption of\npublic morals. In proof of which I now place before the court your own\nadmission, that more than one citizen of the Republic has been led by\nyou into immoral relationship with yourself; and further, your own\nadmission, that your accusation against Citizen-Deputy D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de was\nfalse and mischievous; and further, and finally, your immoral and\nobscene correspondence with some persons unknown, which you vainly tried\nto destroy. In consideration of which, and in the name of the people of\nFrance, whose spokesman I am, I demand that you be taken hence from this\nHall of Justice to the Place de la R\u00c3\u00a9volution, in full view of the\ncitizens of Paris and its environs, and clad in a soiled white garment,\nemblem of the smirch upon your soul, that there you be publicly whipped\nby the hands of Citizen Samson, the public executioner; after which,\nthat you be taken to the prison of the Salp\u00c3\u00aatriere, there to be further\ndetained at the discretion of the Committee of Public Safety. And now,\nJuliette Marny, you have heard the indictment preferred against you,\nhave you anything to say, why the sentence which I have demanded shall\nnot be passed upon you?\"\n\nJeers, shouts, laughter, and curses greeted this speech of the Public\nProsecutor.\n\nAll that was most vile and most bestial in this miserable, misguided\npeople struggling for Utopia and Liberty, seemed to come to the surface,\nwhilst listening to the reading of this most infamous document.\n\nThe delight of seeing this beautiful, ethereal woman, almost unearthly\nin her proud aloofness, smirched with the vilest mud to which the\nvituperation of man can contrive to sink, was a veritable treat to the\ndegraded wretches.\n\nThe women yelled hoarse approval; the children, not understanding,\nlaughed in mirthless glee; the men, with loud curses, showed their\nappreciation of Foucquier-Tinville's speech.\n\nAs for D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, the mental agony he endured surpassed any torture\nwhich the devils, they say, reserve for the damned. His sinews cracked\nin his frantic efforts to control himself; he dug his finger-nails into\nhis flesh, trying by physical pain to drown the sufferings of his mind.\n\nHe thought that his reason was tottering, that he would go mad if he\nheard another word of this infamy. The hooting and yelling of that\nfilthy mob sounded like the cries of lost souls, shrieking from hell.\nAll his pity for them was gone, his love for humanity, his devotion to\nthe suffering poor.\n\nA great, an immense hatred for this ghastly Revolution and the people it\nprofessed to free filled his whole being, together with a mad, hideous\ndesire to see them suffer, starve, die a miserable, loathsome death. The\npassion of hate, that now overwhelmed his soul, was at least as ugly as\ntheirs. He was, for one brief moment, now at one with them in their\ninordinate lust for revenge.\n\nOnly Juliette throughout all this remained calm, silent, impassive.\n\nShe had heard the indictment, heard the loathsome sentence, for her\nwhite cheeks had gradually become ashy pale, but never for a moment did\nshe depart from her attitude of proud aloofness.\n\nShe never once turned her head towards the mob who insulted her. She\nwaited in complete passiveness until the yelling and shouting had\nsubsided, motionless save for her finger-tips, which beat an impatient\ntattoo upon the railing in front of her.\n\nThe Bulletin says that she took out her handkerchief and wiped her face\nwith it. _Elle s'essuya le front qui fut perl\u00c3\u00a9 de sueur._ The heat had\nbecome oppressive.\n\nThe atmosphere was overcharged with the dank, penetrating odour of\nsteaming, dirty clothes. The room, though vast, was close and\nsuffocating, the tallow candles flickering in the humid, hot air threw\nthe faces of the President and clerks into bold relief, with curious\ncaricature effects of light and shade.\n\nThe petrol lamp above the head of the accused had flared up, and begun\nto smoke, causing the chimney to crack with a sharp report. This\ndiversion effected a momentary silence among the crowd, and the Public\nProsecutor was able to repeat his query:\n\n\"Juliette Marny, have you anything to say in reply to the charge brought\nagainst you, and why the sentence which I have demanded should not be\npassed against you?\"\n\nThe sooty smoke from the lamp came down in small, black, greasy\nparticles; Juliette with her slender finger-tips flicked one of these\nquietly off her sleeve, then she replied:\n\n\"No; I have nothing to say.\"\n\n\"Have you instructed an advocate to defend you, according to your rights\nof citizenship, which the Law allows?\" added the Public Prosecutor\nsolemnly.\n\nJuliette would have replied at once; her mouth had already framed the No\nwith which she meant to answer.\n\nBut now at last had come D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's hour. For this he had been silent,\nhad suffered and had held his peace, whilst twice twenty-four hours had\ndragged their weary lengths along, since the arrest of the woman he\nloved.\n\nIn a moment he was on his feet before them all, accustomed to speak, to\ndominate, to command.\n\n\"Citizeness Juliette Marny has entrusted me with her defence,\" he said,\neven before the No had escaped Juliette's white lips, \"and I am here to\nrefute the charges brought against her, and to demand in the name of the\npeople of France full acquittal and justice for her.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nThe defence.\n\n\nIntense excitement, which found vent in loud applause, greeted\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's statement.\n\n\"_\u00c3\u0087a ira! \u00c3\u00a7a ira! vas-y D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de!_\" came from the crowded benches\nround; and men, women, and children, wearied with the monotony of the\npast proceedings, settled themselves down for a quarter of an hour's\nkeen enjoyment.\n\nIf D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had anything to do with it, the trial was sure to end in\nexcitement. And the people were always ready to listen to their special\nfavourite.\n\nThe citizen-deputies, drowsy after the long, oppressive day, seemed to\nrouse themselves to renewed interest. Lebrun, like a big, shaggy dog,\nshook himself free from creeping somnolence. Robespierre smiled between\nhis thin lips, and looked across at Merlin to see how the situation\naffected him. The enmity between the Minister of Justice and Citizen\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de was well known, and everyone noted, with added zest, that the\nformer wore a keen look of anticipated triumph.\n\nHigh up, on one of the topmost benches, sat Citizen Lenoir, the\nstage-manager of this palpitating drama. He looked down, with obvious\nsatisfaction, at the scene which he himself had suggested last night to\nthe members of the Jacobin Club. Merlin's sharp eyes had tried to pierce\nthe gloom, which wrapped the crowd of spectators, searching vainly to\ndistinguish the broad figure and massive head of the provincial giant.\n\nThe light from the petrol lamp shone full on D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's earnest, dark\ncountenance as he looked Juliette's infamous accuser full in the face,\nbut the tallow candles, flickering weirdly on the President's desk,\nthrew Tinville's short, spare figure and large, unkempt head into\ncurious grotesque silhouette.\n\nJuliette apparently had lost none of her calm, and there was no one\nthere sufficiently interested in her personality to note the tinge of\ndelicate colour which, at the first word of D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, had slowly\nmounted to her pale cheeks.\n\nTinville waited until the wave of excitement had broken upon the shoals\nof expectancy.\n\nThen he resumed:\n\n\"Then, Citizen D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, what have _you_ to say, why sentence should\nnot be passed upon the accused?\"\n\n\"I have to say that the accused is innocent of every charge brought\nagainst her in your indictment,\" replied D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de firmly.\n\n\"And how do you substantiate this statement, Citizen-Deputy?\" queried\nTinville, speaking with mock unctuousness.\n\n\"Very simply, Citizen Tinville. The correspondence to which you refer\ndid not belong to the accused, but to me. It consisted of certain\ncommunications, which I desired to hold with Marie Antoinette, now a\nprisoner in the Conciergerie, during my state there as\nlieutenant-governor. The Citizeness Juliette Marny, by denouncing me,\nwas serving the Republic, for my communications with Marie Antoinette\nhad reference to my own hopes of seeing her quit this country and take\nrefuge in her own native land.\"\n\nGradually, as D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de spoke, a murmur, like the distant roar of a\nmonstrous breaker, rose among the crowd on the upper benches. As he\ncontinued quietly and firmly, so it grew in volume and in intensity,\nuntil his last words were drowned in one mighty, thunderous shout of\nhorror and execration.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, the friend and idol of the people, the privileged darling of\nthis unruly population, the father of the children, the friend of the\nwomen, the sympathiser in all troubles, Papa D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de as the little\nones called him--he a traitor, self-accused, plotting and planning for\nan ex-tyrant, a harlot who had called herself a queen, for Marie\nAntoinette the Austrian, who had desired and worked for the overthrow of\nFrance! He, D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, a traitor!\n\nIn one moment, as he spoke, the love which in their crude hearts they\nbore him, that animal primitive love, was turned to sudden, equally\nirresponsible hate. He had deceived them, laughed at them, tried to\nbribe them by feeding their little ones!\n\nBah! the bread of the traitor! It might have choked the children.\n\nSurprise at first had taken their breath away. Already they had\nmarvelled why he should stand up to defend a wanton. And now, probably\nfeeling that he was on the point of being found out, he thought it\nbetter to make a clean breast of his own treason, trusting in his\npopularity, in his power over the people.\n\nBah!!!\n\nNot one extenuating circumstance did they find in their hardened hearts\nfor him.\n\nHe had been their idol, enshrined in their squalid, degraded minds, and\nnow he had fallen, shattered beyond recall, and they hated and loathed\nhim as much as they had loved him before.\n\nAnd this his enemies noted, and smiled with complete satisfaction.\n\nMerlin heaved a sigh of relief. Tinville nodded his shaggy head, in\ntoken of intense delight.\n\nWhat that provincial coal-heaver had foretold had indeed come to pass.\n\nThe populace, that most fickle of all fickle things in this world, had\nturned all at once against its favourite. This Lenoir had predicted, and\nthe transition had been even more rapid than he had anticipated.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had been given a length of rope, and, figuratively speaking,\nhad already hanged himself.\n\nThe reality was a mere matter of a few hours now. At dawn to-morrow the\nguillotine; and the mob of Paris, who yesterday would have torn his\ndetractors limb from limb, would on the morrow be dragging him, with\nhoots and yells and howls of execration, to the scaffold.\n\nThe most shadowy of all footholds, that of the whim of a populace, had\nalready given way under him. His enemies knew it, and were exulting in\ntheir triumph. He knew it himself, and stood up, calmly defiant, ready\nfor any event, if only he succeeded in snatching her beautiful head from\nthe ready embrace of the guillotine.\n\nJuliette herself had remained as if entranced. The colour had again fled\nfrom her cheeks, leaving them paler, more ashen than before. It seemed\nas if in this moment she suffered more than human creature could bear,\nmore than any torture she had undergone hitherto.\n\nHe would not owe his life to her.\n\nThat was the one overwhelming thought in her, which annihilated all\nothers. His love for her was dead, and he would not accept the great\nsacrifice at her hands.\n\nThus these two in the supreme moment of their life saw each other, yet\ndid not understand. A word, a touch would have given them both the key\nto one another's heart, and it now seemed as if death would part them\nfor ever, whilst that great enigma remained unsolved.\n\nThe Public Prosecutor had been waiting until the noise had somewhat\nsubsided, and his voice could be heard above the din, then he said, with\na smile of ill-concealed satisfaction:\n\n\"And is the court, then, to understand, Citizen-Deputy D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, that\nit was you who tried to burn the treasonable correspondence and to\ndestroy the case which contained it?\"\n\n\"The treasonable correspondence was mine, and it was I who destroyed\nit.\"\n\n\"But the accused admitted before Citizen Merlin that she herself was\ntrying to burn certain love letters, that would have brought to light\nher illicit relationship with another man than yourself,\" argued\nTinville suavely. The rope was perhaps not quite long enough; D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de\nmust have all that could be given him, ere this memorable sitting was\nadjourned.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, however, instead of directing his reply straight to his\nenemy, now turned towards the dense crowd of spectators, on the benches\nopposite to him.\n\n\"Citizens, friends, brothers,\" he said warmly, \"the accused is only a\ngirl, young, innocent knowing nothing of peril or of sin. You all have\nmothers, sisters, daughters--have you not watched those dear to you in\nthe many moods of which a feminine heart is capable; have you not seen\nthem affectionate, tender, and impulsive? Would you love them so dearly\nbut for the fickleness of their moods? Have you not worshipped them in\nyour hearts, for those sublime impulses which put all man's plans and\ncalculations to shame? Look on the accused, citizens. She loves the\nRepublic, the people of France, and feared that I, an unworthy\nrepresentative of her sons, was hatching treason against our great\nmother. That was her first wayward impulse--to stop me before I\ncommitted the awful crime, to punish me, or perhaps only to warn me.\nDoes a young girl calculate, citizens? She acts as her heart dictates;\nher reason but awakes from slumber later on, when the act is done. Then\ncomes repentance sometimes: another impulse of tenderness which we all\nrevere. Would you extract vinegar from rose leaves? Just as readily\ncould you find reason in a young girl's head. Is that a crime? She\nwished to thwart me in my treason; then, seeing me in peril, the sincere\nfriendship she had for me gained the upper hand once more. She loved my\nmother, who might be losing a son; she loved my crippled foster-sister;\nfor _their_ sakes, not for mine--a traitor's--did she yield to another,\na heavenly impulse, that of saving me from the consequences of my own\nfolly. Was _that_ a crime, citizens? When you are ailing, do not your\nmothers, sisters, wives tend you? when you are seriously ill, would they\nnot give their heart's blood to save you? and when, in the dark hours of\nyour lives, some deed which you would not openly avow before the world\noverweights your soul with its burden of remorse, is it not again your\nwomenkind who come to you, with tender words and soothing voices, trying\nto ease your aching conscience, bringing solace, comfort, and peace? And\nso it was with the accused, citizens. She had seen my crime, and longed\nto punish it; she saw those who had befriended her in sorrow, and she\ntried to ease their pain by taking _my_ guilt upon her shoulders. She\nhas suffered for the noble lie, which she had told on my behalf, as no\nwoman has ever been made to suffer before. She has stood, white and\ninnocent as your new-born children, in the pillory of infamy. She was\nready to endure death, and what was ten thousand times worse than death,\nbecause of her own warm-hearted affection. But you, citizens of France,\nwho, above all, are noble, true, and chivalrous, you will not allow the\nsweet impulses of young and tender womanhood to be punished with the ban\nof felony. To you, women of France, I appeal in the name of your\nchildhood, your girlhood, your motherhood; take her to your hearts, she\nis worthy of it, worthier now for having blushed before you, worthier\nthan any heroine in the great roll of honour of France.\"\n\nHis magnetic voice went echoing along the rafters of the great, sordid\nHall of Justice, filling it with a glory it had never known before. His\nenthusiasm thrilled his hearers, his appeal to their honour and chivalry\nroused all the finer feelings within them. Still hating him for his\ntreason, his magical appeal had turned their hearts towards her.\n\nThey had listened to him without interruption, and now at last, when he\npaused, it was very evident, by muttered exclamations and glances cast\nat Juliette, that popular feeling, which up to the present had\npractically ignored her, now went out towards her personality with\noverwhelming sympathy.\n\nObviously at the present moment, if Juliette's fate had been put to the\nplebiscite, she would have been unanimously acquitted.\n\nMerlin, as D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de spoke, had once or twice tried to read his friend\nFoucquier-Tinville's enigmatical expression, but the Public Prosecutor,\nwith his face in deep shadow, had not moved a muscle during the\nCitizen-Deputy's noble peroration. He sat at his desk, chin resting on\nhand, staring before him with an expression of indifference, almost of\nboredom.\n\nNow, when D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de finished speaking, and the outburst of human\nenthusiasm had somewhat subsided, he rose slowly to his feet, and said\nquietly:\n\n\"So you maintain, Citizen-Deputy, that the accused is a chaste and\ninnocent girl, unjustly charged with immorality?\"\n\n\"I do,\" protested D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de loudly.\n\n\"And will you tell the court why you are so ready to publicly accuse\nyourself of treason against the Republic, knowing full well all the\nconsequences of your action?\"\n\n\"Would any Frenchman care to save his own life at the expense of a\nwoman's honour?\" retorted D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de proudly.\n\nA murmur of approval greeted these words, and Tinville remarked\nunctuously:\n\n\"Quite so, quite so. We esteem your chivalry, Citizen-Deputy. The same\nspirit, no doubt, actuates you to maintain that the accused knew nothing\nof the papers which you say you destroyed?\"\n\n\"She knew nothing of them. I destroyed them; I did not know that they\nhad been found; on my return to my house I discovered that the\nCitizeness Juliette Marny had falsely accused herself of having\ndestroyed some papers surreptitiously.\"\n\n\"She said they were love letters.\"\n\n\"It is false.\"\n\n\"You declare her to be pure and chaste?\"\n\n\"Before the whole world.\"\n\n\"Yet you were in the habit of frequenting the bedroom of this pure and\nchaste girl, who dwelt under your roof,\" said Tinville with slow and\ndeliberate sarcasm.\n\n\"It is false.\"\n\n\"If it be false, Citizen D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de,\" continued the other with the same\nunctuous suavity, \"then how comes it that the correspondence which you\nadmit was treasonable, and therefore presumably secret--how comes it\nthat it was found, still smouldering, in the chaste young woman's\nbedroom, and the torn letter-case concealed among her dresses in a\nvalise?\"\n\n\"It is false.\"\n\n\"The Minister of Justice, Citizen-Deputy Merlin, will answer for the\ntruth of that.\"\n\n\"It is the truth,\" said Juliette quietly.\n\nHer voice rang out clear, almost triumphant, in the midst of the\nbreathless pause, caused by the previous swift questions and loud\nanswers.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de now was silent.\n\nThis one simple fact he did not know. Anne Mie, in telling him the\nevents in connection with the arrest of Juliette, had omitted to give\nhim the one little detail, that the burnt letters were found in the\nyoung girl's bedroom.\n\nUp to the moment when the Public Prosecutor confronted him with it, he\nhad been under the impression that she had destroyed the papers and the\nletter-case in the study, where she had remained alone after Merlin and\nhis men had left the room. She could easily have burnt them there, as a\ntiny spirit lamp was always kept alight on a side table for the use of\nsmokers.\n\nThis little fact now altered the entire course of events. Tinville had\nbut to frame an indignant ejaculation:\n\n\"Citizens of France, see how you are being befooled and hoodwinked!\"\n\nThen he turned once more to D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de.\n\n\"Citizen D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de ...\" he began.\n\nBut in the tumult that ensued he could no longer hear his own voice. The\npent-up rage of the entire mob of Paris seemed to find vent for itself\nin the howls with which the crowd now tried to drown the rest of the\nproceedings.\n\nAs their brutish hearts had been suddenly melted on behalf of Juliette,\nin response to D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's passionate appeal, so now they swiftly\nchanged their sympathetic attitude to one of horror and execration.\n\nTwo people had fooled and deceived them. One of these they had\nreverenced and trusted, as much as their degraded minds were capable of\nreverencing anything, therefore _his_ sin seemed doubly damnable.\n\nHe and that pale-face aristocrat had for weeks now, months, or years\nperhaps, conspired against the Republic, against the Revolution, which\nhad been made by a people thirsting for liberty. During these months and\nyears _he_ had talked to them, and they had listened; he had poured\nforth treasures of eloquence, cajoled them, as he had done just now.\n\nThe noise and hubbub were growing apace. If Tinville and Merlin had\ndesired to infuriate the mob, they had more than succeeded. All that was\nmost bestial, most savage in this awful Parisian populace rose to the\nsurface now in one wild, mad desire for revenge.\n\nThe crowd rushed down from the benches, over one another's heads, over\nchildren's fallen bodies; they rushed down because they wanted to get at\nhim, their whilom favourite, and at his pale-faced mistress, and tear\nthem to pieces, hit them, scratch out their eyes. They snarled like so\nmany wild beasts, the women shrieked, the children cried, and the men of\nthe National Guard, hurrying forward, had much ado to keep back this\nflood-tide of hate.\n\nHad any of them broken loose, from behind the barrier of bayonets\nhastily raised against them, it would have fared ill with D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and\nJuliette.\n\nThe President wildly rang his bell, and his voice, quivering with\nexcitement, was heard once or twice above the din.\n\n\"Clear the court! Clear the court!\"\n\nBut the people refused to be cleared out of court.\n\n\"_A la lanterne les tra\u00c3\u00aetres! Mort \u00c3\u00a0 D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de. A la lanterne!\nl'aristo!_\"\n\nAnd in the thickest of the crowd, the broad shoulders and massive head\nof Citizen Lenoir towered above the others.\n\nAt first it seemed as if he had been urging on the mob in its fury. His\nstrident voice, with its broad provincial accent, was heard distinctly\nshouting loud vituperations against the accused.\n\nThen at a given moment, when the tumult was at its height, when the\nNational Guard felt their bayonets giving way before this onrushing tide\nof human jackals, Lenoir changed his tactics.\n\n\"_Tiens! c'est b\u00c3\u00aate!_\" he shouted loudly, \"we shall do far better with\nthe traitors when we get them outside. What say you, citizens? Shall we\nleave the judges here to conclude the farce, and arrange for its sequel\nourselves outside the 'Tigre Jaune'?\"\n\nAt first but little heed was paid to his suggestion, and he repeated it\nonce or twice, adding some interesting details:\n\n\"One is freer in the streets, where these apes of the National Guard\ncan't get between the people of France and their just revenge. _Ma\nfoi!_\" he added, squaring his broad shoulders, and pushing his way\nthrough the crowd towards the door, \"I for one am going to see where\nhangs the most suitable _lanterne._\"\n\nLike a flock of sheep the crowd now followed him.\n\n\"The nearest _lanterne!_\" they shouted. \"In the streets--in the streets!\n_A la lanterne!_ The traitors!\"\n\nAnd with many a jeer, many a loathsome curse, and still more loathsome\njests, some of the crowd began to file out. A few only remained to see\nthe conclusion of the farce.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nSentence of death.\n\n\nThe \"Bulletin du Tribunal R\u00c3\u00a9volutionnaire\" tells us that both the\naccused had remained perfectly calm during the turmoil which raged\nwithin the bare walls of the Hall of Justice.\n\nCitizen-Deputy D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, however, so the chroniclers aver, though\noutwardly impassive, was evidently deeply moved. He had very expressive\neyes, clear mirrors of the fine, upright soul within, and in them there\nwas a look of intense emotion as he watched the crowd, which he had so\noften dominated and controlled, now turning in hatred against him.\n\nHe seemed actually to be seeing with a spiritual vision, his own\npopularity wane and die.\n\nBut when the thick of the crowd had pushed and jostled itself out of the\nhall, that transient emotion seemed to disappear, and he allowed himself\nquietly to be led from the front bench, where he had sat as a privileged\nmember of the National Convention, to a place immediately behind the\ndock, and between two men of the National Guard.\n\nFrom that moment he was a prisoner, accused of treason against the\nRepublic, and obviously his mock trial would be hurried through by his\ntriumphant enemies, whilst the temper of the people was at boiling point\nagainst him.\n\nComplete silence had succeeded to the raging tumult of the past few\nmoments. Nothing now could be heard in the vast room, save\nFoucquier-Tinville's hastily whispered instructions to the clerk nearest\nto him, and the scratch of the latter's quill pen against the paper.\n\nThe President was, with equal rapidity, affixing his signature to\nvarious papers handed up to him by the other clerks. The few remaining\nspectators, the deputies, and those among the crowd who had elected to\nsee the close of the debate, were silent and expectant.\n\nMerlin was mopping his forehead as if in intense fatigue after a hard\nstruggle; Robespierre was coolly taking snuff.\n\nFrom where D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de stood, he could see Juliette's graceful figure\nsilhouetted against the light of the petrol lamp. His heart was torn\nbetween intense misery at having failed to save her and a curious,\nexultant joy at thought of dying beside her.\n\nHe knew the procedure of this revolutionary tribunal well--knew that\nwithin the next few moments he too would be condemned, that they would\nboth be hustled out of the crowd and dragged through the streets of\nParis, and finally thrown into the same prison, to herd with those who,\nlike themselves, had but a few hours to live.\n\nAnd then to-morrow at dawn, death for them both under the guillotine.\nDeath in public, with all its attendant horrors: the packed tumbril; the\npriest, in civil clothes, appointed by this godless government,\nmuttering conventional prayers and valueless exhortations.\n\nAnd in his heart there was nothing but love for her--love and an intense\npity--for the punishment she was suffering was far greater than her\ncrime. He hoped that in her heart remorse would not be too bitter; and\nhe looked forward with joy to the next few hours, which he would pass\nnear her, during which he could perhaps still console and soothe her.\n\nShe was but the victim of an ideal, of Fate stronger than her own will.\nShe stood, an innocent martyr to the great mistake of her life.\n\nBut the minutes sped on. Foucquier-Tinville had evidently completed his\nnew indictments.\n\nThe one against Juliette Marny was read out first. She was now accused\nof conspiring with Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de against the safety of the Republic, by\nhaving cognisance of a treasonable correspondence carried on with the\nprisoner, Marie Antoinette; by virtue of which accusation the Public\nProsecutor asked her if she had anything to say.\n\n\"No,\" she replied loudly and firmly. \"I pray to God for the safety and\ndeliverance of our Queen, Marie Antoinette, and for the overthrow of\nthis Reign of Terror and Anarchy.\"\n\nThese words, registered in the \"Bulletin du Tribunal R\u00c3\u00a9volutionnaire\"\nwere taken as final and irrefutable proofs of her guilt, and she was\nthen summarily condemned to death.\n\nShe was then made to step down from the dock and D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de to stand in\nher place.\n\nHe listened quietly to the long indictment which Foucquier-Tinville had\nalready framed against him the evening before, in readiness for this\ncontingency. The words \"treason against the Republic\" occurred\nconspicuously and repeatedly. The document itself is at one with the\nthousands of written charges, framed by that odious Foucquier-Tinville\nduring these periods of bloodshed, and which in themselves are the most\nscathing indictments against the odious travesty of Justice, perpetrated\nwith his help.\n\nSelf-accused, and avowedly a traitor, D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de was not even asked if he\nhad anything to say; sentence of death was passed on him, with the\nrapidity and callousness peculiar to these proceedings.\n\nAfter which Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and Juliette Marny were led forth, under\nstrong escort, into the street.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nThe Fructidor Riots.\n\n\nMany accounts, more or less authentic, have been published of the events\nknown to history as the \"Fructidor Riots.\"\n\nBut this is how it all happened: at any rate it is the version related\nsome few days later in England to the Prince of Wales by no less a\npersonage than Sir Percy Blakeney; and who indeed should know better\nthan The Scarlet Pimpernel himself?\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and Juliette Marny were the last of the batch of prisoners who\nwere tried on that memorable day of Fructidor.\n\nThere had been such a number of these, that all the covered carts in use\nfor the conveyance of prisoners to and from the Hall of Justice had\nalready been despatched with their weighty human load; thus it was that\nonly a rough wooden cart, hoodless and rickety, was available, and into\nthis D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and Juliette were ordered to mount.\n\nIt was now close on nine o'clock in the evening. The streets of Paris,\nsparsely illuminated here and there with solitary oil lamps swung across\nfrom house to house on wires, presented a miserable and squalid\nappearance. A thin, misty rain had begun to fall, transforming the\nill-paved roads into morasses of sticky mud.\n\nThe Hall of Justice was surrounded by a howling and shrieking mob, who,\nhaving imbibed all the stores of brandy in the neighbouring drinking\nbars, was now waiting outside in the dripping rain for the express\npurpose of venting its pent-up, spirit-sodden lust of rage against the\nman whom it had once worshipped, but whom now it hated. Men, women, and\neven children swarmed round the principal entrances of the Palais de\nJustice, along the bank of the river as far as the Pont au Change, and\nup towards the Luxembourg Palace, now transformed into the prison, to\nwhich the condemned would no doubt be conveyed.\n\nAlong the river-bank, and immediately facing the Palais de Justice, a\nrow of gallows-shaped posts, at intervals of a hundred yards or more,\nheld each a smoky petrol lamp, at a height of some eight feet from the\nground.\n\nOne of these lamps had been knocked down, and from the post itself there\nnow hung ominously a length of rope, with a noose at the end.\n\nAround this improvised gallows a group of women sat, or rather squatted,\nin the mud; their ragged shifts and kirtles, soaked through with the\ndrizzling rain, hung dankly on their emaciated forms; their hair, in\nsome cases grey, and in others dark or straw-coloured, clung matted\nround their wet faces, on which the dirt and the damp had drawn weird\nand grotesque lines.\n\nThe men were restless and noisy, rushing aimlessly hither and thither,\nfrom the corner of the bridge, up the Rue du Palais, fearful lest their\nprey be conjured away ere their vengeance was satisfied.\n\nOh, how they hated their former idol now! Citizen Lenoir, with his broad\nshoulders and powerful, grime-covered head, towered above the throng;\nhis strident voice, with its raucous, provincial accent, could be\ndistinctly heard above the din, egging on the men, shouting to the\nwomen, stirring up hatred against the prisoners, wherever it showed\nsigns of abating in intensity.\n\nThe coal-heaver, hailing from some distant province, seemed to have set\nhimself the grim task of provoking the infuriated populace to some\nterrible deed of revenge against D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and Juliette.\n\nThe darkness of the street, the fast-falling mist which obscured the\nlight from the meagre oil lamps, seemed to add a certain weirdness to\nthis moving, seething multitude. No one could see his neighbour. In the\nblackness of the night the muttering or yelling figures moved about like\nsome spectral creatures from hellish regions--the Akous of Brittany who\ncall to those about to die; whilst the women squatting in the oozing\nmud, beneath that swinging piece of rope, looked like a group of ghostly\nwitches, waiting for the hour of their Sabbath.\n\nAs D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de emerged into the open, the light from a swinging lantern in\nthe doorway fell upon his face. The foremost of the crowd recognised\nhim; a howl of execration went up to the cloud-covered sky, and a\nhundred hands were thrust out in deadly menace against him.\n\nIt seemed as if they wished to tear him to pieces.\n\n\"_A la lanterne! A la lanterne! le tra\u00c3\u00aetre!_\"\n\nHe shivered slightly, as if with the sudden blast of cold, humid air,\nbut he stepped quietly into the cart, closely followed by Juliette.\n\nThe strong escort of the National Guard, with Commandant Santerre and\nhis two drummers, had much ado to keep back the mob. It was not the\npolicy of the revolutionary government to allow excesses of summary\njustice in the streets: the public execution of traitors on the Place de\nla R\u00c3\u00a9volution, the processions in the tumbrils, were thought to be\nwholesome examples for other would-be traitors to mark and digest.\n\nCitizen Santerre, military commandant of Paris, had ordered his men to\nuse their bayonets ruthlessly, and, to further overawe the populace, he\nordered a prolonged roll of drums, lest D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de took it into his head\nto speak to the crowd.\n\nBut D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had no such intention: he seemed chiefly concerned in\nshielding Juliette from the cold; she had been made to sit in the cart\nbeside him, and he had taken off his coat, and was wrapping it round her\nagainst the penetrating rain.\n\nThe eye-witnesses of these memorable events have declared that, at a\ngiven moment, he looked up suddenly with a curious, eager expression in\nhis eyes, and then raised himself in the cart and seemed to be trying to\npenetrate the gloom round him, as if in search of a face, or perhaps a\nvoice.\n\n\"_A la lanterne! A la lanterne!_\" was the continual hoarse cry of the\nmob.\n\nUp to now, flanked in their rear by the outer walls of the Palais de\nJustice, the soldiers had found it a fairly easy task to keep the crowd\nat bay. But there came a time when the cart was bound to move out into\nthe open, in order to convey the prisoners along, by the Rue du Palais,\nup to the Luxembourg Prison.\n\nThis task, however, had become more and more difficult every moment. The\npeople of Paris, who for two years had been told by its tyrants that it\nwas supreme lord of the universe, was mad with rage at seeing its\ndesires frustrated by a few soldiers.\n\nThe drums had been greeted by terrific yells, which effectually drowned\ntheir roll; the first movement of the cart was hailed by a veritable\ntumult.\n\nOnly the women who squatted round the gallows had not moved from their\nposition of vantage; one of these M\u00c3\u00a6g\u00c3\u00a6ras was quietly readjusting the\nrope, which had got out of place.\n\nBut all the men and some of the women were literally besieging the cart,\nand threatening the soldiers, who stood between them and the object of\ntheir fury.\n\nIt seemed as if nothing now could save D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and Juliette from an\nimmediate and horrible death.\n\n\"_A mort! A mort! A la lanterne les tra\u00c3\u00aetres!_\"\n\nSanterne himself, who had shouted himself hoarse, was at a loss what to\ndo. He had sent one man to the nearest cavalry barracks, but\nreinforcements would still be some little time coming; whilst in the\nmeanwhile his men were getting exhausted, and the mob, more and more\nexcited, threatened to break through their line at every moment.\n\nThere was not another second to be lost.\n\nSanterre was for letting the mob have its way, and he would willingly\nhave thrown it the prey for which it clamoured; but orders were orders,\nand in the year I. of the Revolution it was not good to disobey.\n\nAt this supreme moment of perplexity he suddenly felt a respectful touch\non his arm.\n\nClose behind him a soldier of the National Guard--not one of his own\nmen--was standing at attention, and holding a small, folded paper in his\nhand.\n\n\"Sent to you by the Minister of Justice,\" whispered the soldier\nhurriedly. \"The citizen-deputies have watched the tumult from the Hall;\nthey say, you must not lose an instant.\"\n\nSanterre withdrew from the front rank, up against the side of the cart,\nwhere a rough stable lantern had been fixed. He took the paper from the\nsoldier's hand, and, hastily tearing it open, he read it by the dim\nlight of the lantern.\n\nAs he read, his thick, coarse features expressed the keenest\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"You have two more men with you?\" he asked quickly.\n\n\"Yes, citizen,\" replied the man, pointing towards his right; \"and the\nCitizen-Minister said you would give me two more.\"\n\n\"You'll take the prisoners quietly across to the Prison of the Temple\n--you understand that?\"\n\n\"Yes, citizen; Citizen Merlin has given me full instructions. You can\nhave the cart drawn back a little more under the shadow of the portico,\nwhere the prisoners can be made to alight; they can then be given into my\ncharge. You in the meantime are to stay here with your men, round the\nempty cart, as long as you can. Reinforcements have been sent for, and\nmust soon be here. When they arrive you are to move along with the cart,\nas if you were making for the Luxembourg Prison. This manoeuvre will\ngive us time to deliver the prisoners safely at the Temple.\"\n\nThe man spoke hurriedly and peremptorily, and Santerne was only too\nready to obey. He felt relieved at thought of reinforcements, and glad\nto be rid of the responsibility of conducting such troublesome\nprisoners.\n\nThe thick mist, which grew more and more dense, favoured the new\nmanoeuvre, and the constant roll of drums drowned the hastily given\norders.\n\nThe cart was drawn back into the deepest shadow of the great portico,\nand whilst the mob were howling their loudest, and yelling out frantic\ndemands for the traitors, D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and Juliette were summarily ordered\nto step out of the cart. No one saw them, for the darkness here was\nintense.\n\n\"Follow quietly!\" whispered a raucous voice in their ears as they did\nso, \"or my orders are to shoot you where you stand.\"\n\nBut neither of them had any wish for resistance. Juliette, cold and\nnumb, was clinging to D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, who had placed a protecting arm round\nher.\n\nSanterne had told off two of his men to join the new escort of the\nprisoners, and presently the small party, skirting the walls of the\nPalais de Justice, began to walk rapidly away from the scene of the\nriot.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de noted that some half-dozen men seemed to be surrounding him\nand Juliette, but the drizzling rain blurred every outline. The\nblackness of the night too had become absolutely dense, and in the\ndistance the cries of the populace grew more and more faint.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nThe unexpected.\n\n\nThe small party walked on in silence. It seemed to consist of a very few\nmen of the National Guard, whom Santerne had placed under the command of\nthe soldier who had transmitted to him the orders of the\nCitizen-Deputies.\n\nJuliette and D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de both vaguely wondered whither they were being\nled; to some other prison mayhap, away from the fury of the populace.\nThey were conscious of a sense of satisfaction at thought of being freed\nfrom that pack of raging wild beasts.\n\nBeyond that they cared nothing. Both felt already the shadow of death\nhovering over them. The supreme moment of their lives had come, and had\nfound them side by side.\n\nWhat neither fear nor remorse, sorrow nor joy, could do, that the great\nand mighty Shadow accomplished in a trice.\n\nJuliette, looking death bravely in the face, held out her hand, and\nsought that of the man she loved.\n\nThere was not one word spoken between them, not even a murmur.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, with the unerring instinct of his own unselfish passion,\nunderstood all that the tiny hand wished to convey to him.\n\nIn a moment everything was forgotten save the joy of this touch. Death,\nor the fear of death, had ceased to exist. Life was beautiful, and in\nthe soul of these two human creatures there was perfect peace, almost\nperfect happiness.\n\nWith one grasp of the hand they had sought and found one another's soul.\nWhat mattered the yelling crowd, the noise and tumult of this sordid\nworld? They had found one another, and, hand-in-hand,\nshoulder-to-shoulder, they had gone off wandering into the land of\ndreams, where dwelt neither doubt nor treachery, where there was nothing\nto forgive.\n\nHe no longer said: \"She does not love me--would she have betrayed me\nelse?\" He felt the clinging, trustful touch of her hand, and knew that,\nwith all her faults, her great sin and her lasting sorrow, her woman's\nheart, Heaven's most priceless treasure, was indeed truly his.\n\nAnd she knew that he had forgiven--nay, that he had naught to forgive\n--for Love is sweet and tender, and judges not. Love is Love--whole,\ntrustful, passionate. Love is perfect understanding and perfect peace.\n\nAnd so they followed their escort whithersoever it chose to lead them.\n\nTheir eyes wandered aimlessly over the mist-laden landscape of this\nportion of deserted Paris. They had turned away from the river now, and\nwere following the Rue des Arts. Close by on the right was the dismal\nlittle hostelry, \"La Cruche Cass\u00c3\u00a9e,\" where Sir Percy Blakeney lived.\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, as they neared the place, caught himself vaguely wondering\nwhat had become of his English friend.\n\nBut it would take more than the ingenuity of the Scarlet Pimpernel to\nget two noted prisoners out of Paris to-day. Even if ...\n\n\"Halt!\"\n\nThe word of command rang out clearly and distinctly through the\nrain-soaked atmosphere.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de threw up his head and listened. Something strange and\nunaccountable in that same word of command had struck his sensitive ear.\n\nYet the party had halted, and there was a click as of bayonets or\nmuskets levelled ready to fire.\n\nAll had happened in less than a few seconds. The next moment there was a\nloud cry:\n\n\"_A moi,_ D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de! 'tis the Scarlet Pimpernel!\"\n\nA vigorous blow from an unseen hand had knocked down and extinguished\nthe nearest street lantern.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de felt that he and Juliette were being hastily dragged under an\nadjoining doorway even as the cheery voice echoed along the narrow\nstreet.\n\nHalf-a-dozen men were struggling below in the mud, and there was a\nplentiful supply of honest English oaths. It looked as if the men of the\nNational Guard had fallen upon one another, and had it not been for\nthose same English oaths perhaps D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and Juliette would have been\nslower to understand.\n\n\"Well done, Tony! Gadzooks, Ffoulkes, that was a smart bit of work!\"\n\nThe lazy, pleasant voice was unmistakable, but, God in heaven! where did\nit come from?\n\nOf one thing there could be no doubt. The two men despatched by Santerne\nwere lying disabled on the ground, whilst three other soldiers were busy\npinioning them with ropes.\n\nWhat did it all mean?\n\n\"La, friend D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de! you had not thought, I trust, that I would leave\nMademoiselle Juliette in such a demmed, uncomfortable hole?\"\n\nAnd there, close beside D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and Juliette, stood the tall figure of\nthe Jacobin orator, the bloodthirsty Citizen Lenoir. The two young\npeople gazed and gazed, then looked again, dumfounded, hardly daring to\ntrust their vision, for through the grime-covered mask of the gigantic\ncoal-heaver a pair of merry blue eyes was regarding them with\nlazy-amusement.\n\n\"La! I do look a miserable object, I know,\" said the pseudo coal-heaver\nat last, \"but 'twas the only way to get those murderous devils to do\nwhat I wanted. A thousand pardons, mademoiselle; 'twas I brought you to\nsuch a terrible pass, but la! you are amongst friends now. Will you\ndeign to forgive me?\"\n\nJuliette looked up. Her great, earnest eyes, now swimming in tears,\nsought those of the brave man who had so nobly stood by her and the man\nshe loved.\n\n\"Blakeney ...\" began D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de.\n\nBut Sir Percy quickly interrupted him:\n\n\"Hush, man! we have but a few moments. Remember you are in Paris still,\nand the Lord only knows how we shall all get out of this murderous city\nto-night. I have said that you and mademoiselle are among friends. That\nis all for the moment. I had to get you together, or I should have\nfailed. I could only succeed by subjecting you and mademoiselle to\nterrible indignities. Our League could plan but one rescue, and I had to\nadopt the best means at my command to have you condemned and led away\ntogether. Faith!\" he added, with a pleasant laugh, \"my friend Tinville\nwill not be pleased when he realises that Citizen Lenoir has dragged the\nCitizen-Deputies by the nose.\"\n\nWhilst he spoke he had led D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and Juliette into a dark and narrow\nroom on the ground floor of the hostelry, and presently he called loudly\nfor Brogard, the host of this uninviting abode.\n\n\"Brogard!\" shouted Sir Percy. \"Where is that ass Brogard? La! man,\" he\nadded as Citizen Brogard, obsequious and fussy, and with pockets stuffed\nwith English gold, came shuffling along, \"where do you hide your\nengaging countenance? Here! another length of rope for the gallant\nsoldiers. Bring them in here, then give them that potion down their\nthroats, as I have prescribed. Demm it! I wish we need not have brought\nthem along, but that devil Santerre might have been suspicious else.\nThey'll come to no harm, though, and can do us no mischief.\"\n\nHe prattled along merrily. Innately kind and chivalrous, he wished to\ngive D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and Juliette time to recover from their dazed surprise.\n\nThe transition from dull despair to buoyant hope had been so sudden: it\nhad all happened in less than three minutes.\n\nThe scuffle had been short and sudden outside. The two soldiers of\nSanterne had been taken completely unawares, and the three young\nlieutenants of the Scarlet Pimpernel had fallen on them with such vigour\nthat they had hardly had time to utter a cry of \"Help!\"\n\nMoreover, that cry would have been useless. The night was dark and wet,\nand those citizens who felt ready for excitement were busy mobbing the\nHall of Justice, a mile and a half away. One or two heads had appeared\nat the small windows of the squalid houses opposite, but it was too dark\nto see anything, and the scuffle had very quickly subsided.\n\nAll was silent now in the Rue des Arts, and in the grimy coffee-room of\nthe Cruche Cass\u00c3\u00a9e two soldiers of the National Guard were lying bound\nand gagged, whilst three others were gaily laughing, and wiping their\nrain-soaked hands and faces.\n\nIn the midst of them all stood the tall, athletic figure of the bold\nadventurer who had planned this impudent coup.\n\n\"La! we've got so far, friends, haven't we?\" he said cheerily, \"and now\nfor the immediate future. We must all be out of Paris to-night, or the\nguillotine for the lot of us to-morrow.\"\n\nHe spoke gaily, and with that pleasant drawl of his which was so well\nknown in the fashionable assemblies of London; but there was a ring of\nearnestness in his voice, and his lieutenants looked up at him, ready to\nobey him in all things, but aware that danger was looming threateningly\nahead.\n\nLord Anthony Dewhurst, Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, and Lord Hastings, dressed\nas soldiers of the National Guard, had played their part to perfection.\nLord Hastings had presented the order to Santerre, and the three young\nbucks, at the word of command from their chief, had fallen upon and\noverpowered the two men whom the commandant of Paris had despatched to\nlook after the prisoners.\n\nSo far all was well. But how to get out of Paris? Everyone looked to the\nScarlet Pimpernel for guidance.\n\nSir Percy now turned to Juliette, and with the consummate grace which\nthe elaborate etiquette of the times demanded, he made her a courtly\nbow.\n\n\"Mademoiselle de Marny,\" he said, \"allow me to conduct you to a room,\nwhich though unworthy of your presence will, nevertheless, enable you to\nrest quietly for a few minutes, whilst I give my friend D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de\nfurther advice and instructions. In the room you will find a disguise,\nwhich I pray you to don with all haste. La! they are filthy rags, I own,\nbut your life and--and ours depend upon your help.\"\n\nGallantly he kissed the tips of her fingers, and opened the door of an\nadjoining room to enable her to pass through; then he stood aside, so\nthat her final look, as she went, might be for D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de.\n\nAs soon as the door had closed upon her he once more turned to the men.\n\n\"Those uniforms will not do now,\" he said peremptorily; \"there are\nbundles of abominable clothes here, Tony. Will you all don them as\nquickly as you can? We must all look as filthy a band of _sansculottes_\nto-night as ever walked the streets of Paris.\"\n\nHis lazy drawl had deserted him now. He was the man of action and of\nthought, the bold adventurer who held the lives of his friends in the\nhollow of his hand.\n\nThe four men hastily obeyed. Lord Anthony Dewhurst--one of the most\nelegant dandies of London society--had brought forth from a dank\ncupboard a bundle of clothes, mere rags, filthy but useful.\n\nWithin ten minutes the change was accomplished, and four dirty, slouchy\nfigures stood confronting their chief.\n\n\"That's capital!\" said Sir Percy merrily.\n\n\"Now for Mademoiselle de Marny.\"\n\nHardly had he spoken when the door of the adjoining room was pushed\nopen, and a horrible apparition stood before the men. A woman in filthy\nbodice and skirt, with face covered in grime, her yellow hair, matted\nand greasy, thrust under a dirty and crumpled cap.\n\nA shout of rapturous delight greeted this uncanny apparition.\n\nJuliette, like the true woman she was, had found all her energy and\nspirits now that she felt that she had an important part to play. She\nwoke from her dream to realise that noble friends had risked their lives\nfor the man she loved and for her.\n\nOf herself she did not think; she only remembered that her presence of\nmind, her physical and mental strength, would be needed to carry the\nrescue to a successful end.\n\nTherefore with the rags of a Paris _tricotteuse_ she had also donned her\npersonality. She played her part valiantly, and one look at the\nperfection of her disguise was sufficient to assure the leader of this\nband of heroes that his instructions would be carried through to the\nletter.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de too now looked the ragged _sansculotte_ to the life, with bare\nand muddy feet, frayed breeches, and shabby, black-shag spencer. The\nfour men stood waiting together with Juliette, whilst Sir Percy gave\nthem his final instructions.\n\n\"We'll mix with the crowd,\" he said, \"and do all that the crowd does. It\nis for us to see that that unruly crowd does what we want. Mademoiselle\nde Marny, a thousand congratulations. I entreat you to take hold of my\nfriend D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's hand, and not to let go of it, on any pretext\nwhatever. La! not a difficult task, I ween,\" he added, with his genial\nsmile; \"and yours, D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, is equally easy. I enjoin you to take\ncharge of Mademoiselle Juliette, and on no account to leave her side\nuntil we are out of Paris.\"\n\n\"Out of Paris!\" echoed D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, with a troubled sigh.\n\n\"Aye!\" rejoined Sir Percy boldly; \"out of Paris! with a howling mob at\nour heels causing the authorities to take double precautions. And above\nall remember, friends, that our rallying cry is the shrill call of the\nsea-mew thrice repeated. Follow it until you are outside the gates of\nParis. Once there, listen for it again; it will lead you to freedom and\nsafety at last. Aye! Outside Paris, by the grace of God.\"\n\nThe hearts of his hearers thrilled as they heard him. Who could help but\nfollow this brave and gallant adventurer, with the magic voice and the\nnoble bearing?\n\n\"And now _en route_!\" said Blakeney finally, \"that ass Santerre will\nhave dispersed the pack of yelling hyenas with his cavalry by now.\nThey'll to the Temple prison to find their prey; we'll in their wake. _A\nmoi,_ friends! and remember the sea-gull's cry.\"\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de drew Juliette's hand in his.\n\n\"We are ready,\" he said; \"and God bless the Scarlet Pimpernel.\"\n\nThen the five men, with Juliette in their midst, went out into the\nstreet once more.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nP\u00c3\u00a8re Lachaise.\n\n\nIt was not difficult to guess which way the crowd had gone; yells,\nhoots, and hoarse cries could be heard from the farther side of the\nriver.\n\nCitizen Santerne had been unable to keep the mob back until the arrival\nof the cavalry reinforcements. Within five minutes of the abduction of\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and Juliette the crowd had broken through the line of\nsoldiers, and had stormed the cart, only to find it empty, and the prey\ndisappeared.\n\n\"They are safe in the Temple by now!\" shouted Santerne hoarsely, in\nsavage triumph at seeing them all baffled.\n\nAt first it seemed as if the wrath of the infuriated populace, fooled in\nits lust for vengeance, would vent itself against the commandant of\nParis and his soldiers; for a moment even Santerre's ruddy cheeks had\npaled at the sudden vision of this unlooked for danger.\n\nThen just as suddenly the cry was raised.\n\n\"To the Temple!\"\n\n\"To the Temple! To the Temple!\" came in ready response.\n\nThe cry was soon taken up by the entire crowd, and in less than two\nminutes the purlieus of the Hall of Justice were deserted, and the Pont\nSt Michel, then the Cit\u00c3\u00a9 and the Pont au Change, swarmed with the\nrioters. Thence along the north bank of the river, and up the Rue du\nTemple, the people still yelling, muttering, singing the \"_\u00c3\u0087a ira,_\" and\nshouting: \"_A la lanterne! A la lanterne!_\"\n\nSir Percy Blakeney and his little band of followers had found the Pont\nNeuf and the adjoining streets practically deserted. A few stragglers\nfrom the crowd, soaked through with the rain, their enthusiasm damped,\nand their throats choked with the mist, were sulkily returning to their\nhomes.\n\nThe desultory group of six _sansculottes_ attracted little or no\nattention, and Sir Percy boldly challenged every passer-by.\n\n\"The way to the Rue du Temple, citizen?\" he asked once or twice, or:\n\n\"Have they hung the traitor yet? Can you tell me, citizeness?\"\n\nA grunt or an oath were the usual replies, but no one took any further\nnotice of the gigantic coal-heaver and his ragged friends.\n\nAt the corner of one of the cross streets, between the Rue du Temple and\nthe Rue des Archives, Sir Percy Blakeney suddenly turned to his\nfollowers:\n\n\"We are close to the rabble now,\" he said in a whisper, and speaking in\nEnglish; \"do you all follow the nearest stragglers, and get as soon as\npossible into the thickest of the crowd. We'll meet again outside the\nprison--and remember the sea-gull's cry.\"\n\nHe did not wait for an answer, and presently disappeared in the mist.\n\nAlready a few stragglers, hangers-on of the multitude, were gradually\ncoming into view, and the yells could be distinctly heard. The mob had\nevidently assembled in the great square outside the prison, and was\nloudly demanding the object of its wrath.\n\nThe moment for cool-headed action was at hand. The Scarlet Pimpernel had\nplanned the whole thing, but it was for his followers and for those,\nwhom he was endeavouring to rescue from certain death, to help him heart\nand soul.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's grasp tightened on Juliette's little hand.\n\n\"Are you frightened, my beloved?\" he whispered.\n\n\"Not whilst you are near me,\" she murmured in reply.\n\nA few more minutes' walk up the Rue des Archives and they were in the\nthick of the crowd. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, Lord Anthony Dewhurst, and Lord\nHastings, the three Englishmen, were in front; D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and Juliette\nimmediately behind them.\n\nThe mob itself now carried them along. A motley throng they were, soaked\nthrough with the rain, drunk with their own baffled rage, and with the\nbrandy which they had imbibed.\n\nEveryone was shouting; the women louder than the rest; one of them was\ndragging the length of rope, which might still be useful.\n\n\"_\u00c3\u0087a ira! \u00c3\u00a7a ira! A la lanterne! A la lanterne! les tra\u00c3\u00aetres!_\"\n\nAnd D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, holding Juliette by the hand, shouted lustily with them:\n\n\"_\u00c3\u0087a ira!_\"\n\nSir Andrew Ffoulkes turned, and laughed. It was rare sport for these\nyoung bucks, and they all entered into the spirit of the situation. They\nall shouted \"_A la lanterne!_\" egging and encouraging those around them.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and Juliette felt the intoxication of the adventure. They were\ndrunk with the joy of their reunion, and seized with the wild, mad,\npassionate desire for freedom and for life ... Life and love!\n\nSo they pushed and jostled on in the mud, followed the crowd, sang and\nyelled louder than any of them. Was not that very crowd the great\nbulwark of their safety?\n\nAs well have sought for the proverbial needle in the haystack, as for\ntwo escaped prisoners in this mad, heaving throng.\n\nThe large open space in front of the Temple Prison looked like one\ngreat, seething, black mass.\n\nThe darkness was almost thick here, the ground like a morass, with\ninches of clayey mud, which stuck to everything, whilst the sparse\nlanterns, hung to the prison walls and beneath the portico, threw\npractically no light into the square.\n\nAs the little band, composed of the three Englishmen, and of D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de,\nholding Juliette by the hand, emerged into the open space, they heard a\nstrident cry, like that of a sea-mew thrice repeated, and a hoarse voice\nshouting from out the darkness:\n\n\"_Ma foi!_ I'll not believe that the prisoners are in the Temple now! It\nis my belief, friends, citizens, that we have been fooled once more!\"\n\nThe voice, with its strange, unaccountable accent, which seemed to\nbelong to no province of France, dominated the almost deafening noise;\nit penetrated through, even into the brandy-soddened minds of the\nmultitude, for the suggestion was received with renewed shouts of the\nwildest wrath.\n\nLike one great, living, seething mass the crowd literally bore down upon\nthe huge and frowning prison. Pushing, jostling, yelling, the women\nscreaming, the men cursing, it seemed as if that awesome day--the 14th\nof July--was to have its sanguinary counterpart to-night, as if the\nTemple were destined to share the fate of the Bastille.\n\nObedient to their leader's orders the three young Englishmen remained in\nthe thick of the crowd: together with D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de they contrived to form a\nsturdy rampart round Juliette, effectually protecting her against rough\nbuffetings.\n\nOn their right, towards the direction of M\u00c3\u00a9nilmontant, the sea-mew's cry\nat intervals gave the strength and courage.\n\nThe foremost rank of the crowd had reached the portico of the building,\nand, with howls and snatches of their gutter song, were loudly\nclamouring for the guardian of the grim prison.\n\nNo one appeared; the great gates with their massive bars and hinges\nremained silent and defiant.\n\nThe crowd was becoming dangerous: whispers of the victory of the\nBastille, five years ago, engendered thoughts of pillage and of arson.\n\nThen the strident voice was heard again:\n\n\"_Pardi!_ the prisoners are not in the Temple! The dolts have allowed\nthem to escape, and now are afraid of the wrath of the people!\"\n\nIt was strange how easily the mob assimilated this new idea. Perhaps the\ndark, frowning block of massive buildings had overawed them with its\npeaceful strength, perhaps the dripping rain and oozing clay had damped\ntheir desire for an immediate storming of the grim citadel; perhaps it\nwas merely the human characteristic of a wish for something new,\nsomething unexpected.\n\nBe that as it may, the cry was certainly taken up with marvellous,\nquick-change rapidity.\n\n\"The prisoners have escaped! The prisoners have escaped!\"\n\nSome were for proceeding with the storming of the Temple, but they were\nin the minority. All along, the crowd had been more inclined for private\nrevenge than for martial deeds of valour; the Bastille had been taken by\ndaylight; the effort might not have been so successful on a pitch-black\nnight such as this, when one could not see one's hand before one's eyes,\nand the drizzling rain went through to the marrow.\n\n\"They've got through one of the barriers by now!\" suggested the same\nvoice from out the darkness.\n\n\"The barriers--the barriers!\" came in sheeplike echo from the crowd.\n\nThe little group of fugitives and their friends tightened their hold on\none another.\n\nThey had understood at last.\n\n\"It is for us to see that the crowd does what we want,\" the Scarlet\nPimpernel had said.\n\nHe wanted it to take him and his friends out of Paris, and, by God! he\nwas like to succeed.\n\nJuliette's heart within her beat almost to choking; her strong little\nhand gripped D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's fingers with the wild strength of a mad\nexultation.\n\nNext to the man to whom she had given her love and her very soul she\nadmired and looked up to the remarkable and noble adventurer, the\nhigh-born and exquisite dandy, who with grime-covered face, and strong\nlimbs encased in filthy clothes, was playing the most glorious part ever\nenacted upon the stage.\n\n\"To the barriers--to the barriers!\"\n\nLike a herd of wild horses, driven by the whip of the herdsmen, the mob\nbegan to scatter in all directions. Not knowing what it wanted, not\nknowing what it would find, half forgetting the very cause and object of\nits wrath, it made one gigantic rush for the gates of the great city\nthrough which the prisoners were supposed to have escaped.\n\nThe three Englishmen and D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, with Juliette well protected in\ntheir midst, had not joined the general onrush as yet. The crowd in the\nopen place was still very thick, the outward-branching streets were very\nnarrow: through these the multitude, scampering, hurrying, scurrying,\nlike a human torrent let out of a whirlpool, rushed down headlong\ntowards the barriers.\n\nUp the Rue Turbigo to the Belleville gate, the Rue des Filles, and the\nRue du Chemin Vert, towards Popincourt, they ran, knocking each other\ndown, jostling the weaker ones on one side, trampling others underfoot.\nThey were all rough, coarse creatures, accustomed to these wild\nbousculades, ready to pick themselves up, again after any number of\nfalls; whilst the mud was slimy and soft to tumble on, and those who did\nthe trampling had no shoes on their feet.\n\nThey rushed out from the dark, open place, these creatures of the night,\ninto streets darker still.\n\nOn they ran--on! on!--now in thick, heaving masses, anon in loose,\nstraggling groups--some north, some south, some east, some west.\n\nBut it was from the east that came the seagull's cry.\n\nThe little band ran boldly towards the east. Down the Rue de la\nR\u00c3\u00a9publique they followed their leader's call. The crowd was very thick\nhere; the Barri\u00c3\u00a8re M\u00c3\u00a9nilmontant was close by, and beyond it there was\nthe cemetery of P\u00c3\u00a8re Lachaise. It was the nearest gate to the Temple\nPrison, and the mob wanted to be up and doing, not to spend too much\ntime running along the muddy streets and getting wet and cold, but to\nrepeat the glorious exploits of the 14th of July, and capture the\nbarriers of Paris by force of will rather than force of arms.\n\nIn this rushing mob the four men, with Juliette in their midst, remained\nquite unchallenged, mere units in an unruly crowd.\n\nIn a quarter of an hour M\u00c3\u00a9nilmontant was reached.\n\nThe great gates of the city were well guarded by detachments of the\nNational Guard, each under command of an officer. Twenty strong at\nmost--what was that against such a throng?\n\nWho had ever dreamed of Paris being stormed from within?\n\nAt every gate to the north and east of the city there was now a rabble\nsome four or five thousand strong, wanting it knew not what. Everyone\nhad forgotten what it was that caused him or her to rush on so blindly,\nso madly, towards the nearest barrier.\n\nBut everyone knew that he or she wanted to get through that barrier, to\nattack the soldiery, to knock down the captain of the Guard.\n\nAnd with a wild cry every city gate was stormed.\n\nLike one huge wind-tossed wave, the populace on that memorable night of\nFructidor, broke against the cordon of soldiery, that vainly tried to\nkeep it back. Men and women, drunk with brandy and exultation, shouted\n\"_Quatorze Juillet!_\" and amidst curses and threats demanded the opening\nof the gates.\n\nThe people of France _would_ have its will.\n\nWas it not the supreme lord and ruler of the land, the arbiter of the\nFate of this great, beautiful, and maddened country?\n\nThe National Guard was powerless; the officers in command could offer\nbut feeble resistance.\n\nThe desultory fire, which in the darkness and the pouring rain did very\nlittle harm, had the effect of further infuriating the mob.\n\nThe drizzle had turned to a deluge, a veritable heavy summer downpour,\nwith occasional distant claps of thunder and incessant sheet-lightning,\nwhich ever and anon illumined with its weird, fantastic flash this\nheaving throng, these begrimed faces, crowned with red caps of Liberty,\nthese witchlike female creatures with wet, straggly hair and gaunt,\nmenacing arms.\n\nWithin half-an-hour the people of Paris was outside its own gates.\n\nVictory was complete. The Guard did not resist; the officers had\nsurrendered; the great and mighty rabble had had its way.\n\nExultant, it swarmed around the fortifications and along the _terrains\nvagues_ which it had conquered by its will.\n\nBut the downpour was continuous, and with victory came satiety--satiety\ncoupled with wet skins, muddy feet, tired, wearied bodies, and throats\nparched with continual shouting.\n\nAt M\u00c3\u00a9nilmontant, where the crowd had been thickest, the tempers highest,\nand the yells most strident, there now stretched before this tired,\nexcited throng, the peaceful vastness of the cemetery of P\u00c3\u00a8re Lachaise.\n\nThe great alleys of sombre monuments, the weird cedars with their\nfantastic branches, like arms of a hundred ghosts, quelled and awed\nthese hooting masses of degraded humanity.\n\nThe silent majesty of this city of the dead seemed to frown with\nwithering scorn on the passions of the sister city.\n\nInstinctively the rabble was cowed. The cemetery looked dark, dismal,\nand deserted. The flashes of lightning seemed to reveal ghostlike\nprocessions of the departed heroes of France, wandering silently amidst\nthe tombs.\n\nAnd the populace turned with a shudder away from this vast place of\neternal peace.\n\nFrom within the cemetery gates, there was suddenly heard the sound of a\nsea-mew calling thrice to its mate. And five dark figures, wrapped in\ncloaks, gradually detached themselves from the throng, and one by one\nslipped into the grounds of P\u00c3\u00a8re Lachaise through that break in the\nwall, which is quite close to the main entrance.\n\nOnce more the sea-gull's cry.\n\nThose in the crowd who heard it, shivered beneath their dripping\nclothes. They thought it was a soul in pain risen from one of the\ngraves, and some of the women, forgetting the last few years of\ngodlessness, hastily crossed themselves, and muttered an invocation to\nthe Virgin Mary.\n\nWithin the gates all was silent and at peace. The sodden earth gave\nforth no echo of the muffled footsteps, which slowly crept towards the\nmassive block of stone, which covers the graves of the immortal lovers\n--Ab\u00c3\u00a9lard and Helo\u00c3\u00afse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nConclusion.\n\n\nThere is but little else to record.\n\nHistory has told us how, shamefaced, tired, dripping, the great,\nall-powerful people of Paris quietly slunk back to their homes, even\nbefore the first cock-crow in the villages beyond the gates, acclaimed\nthe pale streak of dawn.\n\nBut long before that, even before the church bells of the great city had\ntolled the midnight hour, Sir Percy Blakeney and his little band of\nfollowers had reached the little tavern which stands close to the\nfarthest gate of P\u00c3\u00a8re Lachaise.\n\nWithout a word, like six silent ghosts, they had traversed the vast\ncemetery, and reached the quiet hostelry, where the sounds of the\nseething revolution only came, attenuated by their passage through the\npeaceful city of the dead.\n\nEnglish gold had easily purchased silence and good will from the\nhalf-starved keeper of this wayside inn. A huge travelling chaise\nalready stood in readiness, and four good Flanders horses had been\npawing the ground impatiently for the past half hour. From the window of\nthe chaise old P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle's face, wet with anxious tears, was peering\nanxiously.\n\nA cry of joy and surprise escaped D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and Juliette, and both\nturned, with a feeling akin to awe, towards the wonderful man who had\nplanned and carried through this bold adventure.\n\n\"Nay, my friend,\" said Sir Percy, speaking more especially to D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de;\n\"if you only knew how simple it all was! Gold can do so many things, and\nmy only merit seems to be the possession of plenty of that commodity.\nYou told me yourself how you had provided for old P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle. Under the\nmost solemn assurance that she would meet her young mistress here, I got\nher to leave Paris. She came out most bravely this morning in one of the\nmarket carts. She is so obviously a woman of the people, that no one\nsuspected her. As for the worthy couple who keep this wayside hostel,\nthey have been well paid, and money soon procures a chaise and horses.\nMy English friends and I, we have our own passports, and one for\nMademoiselle Juliette, who must travel as an English lady, with her old\nnurse, P\u00c3\u00a9tronelle. There are some decent clothes in readiness for us all\nin the inn. A quarter of an hour in which to don them and we must on our\nway. You can use your own passport, of course; your arrest has been so\nvery sudden that it has not yet been cancelled, and we have an eight\nhours' start of our enemies. They'll wake up to-morrow morning, begad!\nand find that you have slipped through their fingers.\"\n\nHe spoke with easy carelessness, and that slow drawl of his, as if he\nwere talking airy nothings in a London drawing-room, instead of\nrecounting the most daring, most colossal piece of effrontery the\nadventurous brain of man could conceive.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de could say nothing. His own noble heart was too full of\ngratitude towards his friend to express it all in a few words.\n\nAnd time, of course, was precious.\n\nWithin the prescribed quarter of an hour the little band of heroes had\ndoffed their grimy, ragged clothes, and now appeared dressed as\nrespectable bourgeois of Paris _en route_ for the country. Sir Percy\nBlakeney had donned the livery of a coachman of a well-to-do house,\nwhilst Lord Anthony Dewhurst wore that of an English lacquey.\n\nFive minutes later D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de had lifted Juliette into the travelling\nchaise, and in spite of fatigue, of anxiety, and emotion, it was\nimmeasurable happiness to feel her arm encircling his shoulders in\nperfect joy and trust.\n\nSir Andrew Ffoulkes and Lord Hastings joined them inside the chaise;\nLord Anthony sat next to Sir Percy on the box.\n\nAnd whilst the crowd of Paris was still wondering why it had stormed the\ngates of the city, the escaped prisoners were borne along the muddy\nroads of France at breakneck speed northward to the coast.\n\nSir Percy Blakeney held the reins himself. With his noble heart full of\njoy, the gallant adventurer himself drove his friends to safety.\n\nThey had an eight hours' start, and The League of The Scarlet Pimpernel\nhad done its work thoroughly: well provided with passports, and with\nrelays awaiting them at every station of fifty miles or so, the journey,\nthough wearisome was free from further adventure.\n\nAt Le Havre the little party embarked on board Sir Percy Blakeney's\nyacht the _Daydream,_ where they met Madame D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de and Anne Mie.\n\nThe two ladies, acting under the instructions of Sir Percy, had as\noriginally arranged, pursued their journey northwards, to the populous\nseaport town.\n\nAnne Mie's first meeting with Juliette was intensely pathetic. The poor\nlittle cripple had spent the last few days in an agony of remorse,\nwhilst the heavy travelling chaise bore her farther and farther away\nfrom Paris.\n\nShe thought Juliette dead, and Paul a prey to despair, and her tender\nsoul ached when she remembered that it was she who had given the final\ndeadly stab to the heart of the man she loved.\n\nHers was the nature born to abnegation: aye! and one destined to find\nbliss therein. And when one glance in Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's face told her\nthat she was forgiven, her cup of joy at seeing him happy beside his\nbeloved, was unalloyed with any bitterness.\n\n<tb>\n\nIt was in the beautiful, rosy dawn of one of the last days of that\nmemorable Fructidor, when Juliette and Paul D\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de, standing on the\ndeck of the _Daydream,_ saw the shores of France gradually receding from\ntheir view.\n\nD\u00c3\u00a9roul\u00c3\u00a8de's arm was round his beloved, her golden hair, fanned by the\nbreeze, brushed lightly against his cheek.\n\n\"Madonna!\" he murmured.\n\nShe turned her head to him. It was the first time that they were quite\nalone, the first time that all thought of danger had become a mere\ndream.\n\nWhat had the future in store for them, in that beautiful, strange land\nto which the graceful yacht was swiftly bearing them?\n\nEngland, the land of freedom, would shelter their happiness and their\njoy; and they looked out towards the North, where lay, still hidden in\nthe arms of the distant horizon, the white cliffs of Albion, whilst the\nmist even now was wrapping in its obliterating embrace the shores of the\nland where they had both suffered, where they had both learned to love.\n\nHe took her in his arms.\n\n\"My wife!\" he whispered.\n\nThe rosy light touched her golden hair; he raised her face to his, and\nsoul met soul in one long, passionate kiss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of I Will Repay, by Baroness Emmuska Orczy\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK I WILL REPAY ***\n\n***** This file should be named 5090-8.txt or 5090-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/5\/0\/9\/5090\/\n\nProduced by Walter Debeuf, Project Gutenberg volunteer.\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":117,"split":"train"}
