After her mother's death, Lisbeth (given the nickname Longskirt, or Sids\u0102\u015ark in the original Norwegian, because of her much too-long skirt, a Christmas present given her by her brother) as she moves from her original home at New Ridge farm (called \"Peerout Castle\" for its fine view of the valley), to Hoel farm, one of the central farms of the area. Her brother, Jacob, also goes to Nordrum farm to become a herdsman there. At Hoel, Lisbeth is cared for by Kjersti Hoel, the farm's owner, who has made a promise to Lisbeth's mother before she died. Lisbeth works with livestock both at the farm, and at the seter (s\u0102\u015ater in the book's transliteration), a mountain pasture used during the summertime. At the seter, Lisbeth meets two other herdsmen from neighboring farms, and spends the summer with them, getting to know them as she grows up.\nThe content of the book concerns the difficult conditions of the work of the country children who had to eke out a poor existence far away from their parents. In spite of this account of their hard lot an optimistic kind of portrayal is predominant.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Lisbeth Longfrock, by Hans Aanrud\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

They\nare generally concerned with peasant character, and present in true\nbalance the coarse and fine in peasant nature. The style of speech is\noccasionally over-concrete for sophisticated ears, but it is not\nunwholesome. Of weak or cloying sweetness--so abhorrent to Norwegian\ntaste--there is never a trace.\n\n_Sidsel Sids\u00c3\u00a6rk_ was dedicated to the author's daughter on her eighth\nbirthday, and is doubtless largely reminiscent of Aanrud's own\nchildhood. If I have been able to give a rendering at all worthy of the\noriginal, readers of _Lisbeth Longfrock_ will find that the whole story\nbreathes a spirit of unaffected poetry not inconsistent with the common\nlife which it depicts. This fine blending of the poetic and commonplace\nis another characteristic of Aanrud's writings.\n\nWhile translating the book I was living in the region where the scenes\nof the story are laid, and had the benefit of local knowledge\nconcerning terms used, customs referred to, etc. No pains were spared\nin verifying particulars, especially through elderly people on the\nfarms, who could best explain the old-fashioned terms and who had a\nclear remembrance of obsolescent details of s\u00c3\u00a6ter life. For this\nwelcome help and for elucidations through other friends I wish here to\noffer my hearty thanks.\n\nBeing desirous of having the conditions of Norwegian farm life made as\nclear as possible to young English and American readers, I felt that\nseveral illustrations were necessary and that it would be well for\nthese to be the work of a Norwegian. To understand how the sun can be\nalready high in the heavens when it rises, and how, when it sets, the\nshadow of the western mountain can creep as quickly as it does from the\nbottom of the valley up the opposite slope, one must have some\nconception of the narrowness of Norwegian valleys, with steep mountain\nridges on either side. I felt also that readers would be interested in\npictures showing how the dooryard of a well-to-do Norwegian farm looks,\nhow the open fireplace of the roomy kitchen differs from our\nfireplaces, how tall and slender a Norwegian stove is, built with\nalternating spaces and heat boxes, several stories high, and how\nCrookhorn and the billy goat appeared when about to begin their grand\ntussle up at Hoel S\u00c3\u00a6ter.\n\n_Sidsel Sids\u00c3\u00a6rk_ has given much pleasure to old and young. I hope that\n_Lisbeth Longfrock_ may have the same good fortune.\n\nLAURA E.

In spite of the bright\nsunshine, however, Bearhunter would have liked to be indoors much\nbetter than out, if his sense of responsibility had permitted; for his\npaws ached with the cold, and he had to keep holding them up one after\nanother from the stone slab to keep from getting the \"claw ache.\"\nBearhunter did not wish to risk that, because \"claw ache\" is very\npainful, as every northern dog knows.\n\nBut to leave his post as watchman was not to be thought of just now,\nfor the pigs and the goats were out to-day. At this moment they were\nbusy with their separate affairs and behaving very well,--the pigs over\non the sunny side of the dooryard scratching themselves against the\ncorner of the cow house, and the goats gnawing bark from the big heap\nof pine branches that had been laid near the sheep barn for their\nspecial use. They looked as if they thought of nothing but their\nscratching and gnawing; but Bearhunter knew well, from previous\nexperience, that no sooner would he go into the house than both pigs\nand goats would come rushing over to the doorway and do all the\nmischief they could. That big goat, Crookhorn,--the new one who had\ncome to the farm last autumn and whom Bearhunter had not yet brought\nunder discipline,--had already strayed in a roundabout way to the very\ncorner of the farmhouse, and was looking at Bearhunter in a\nself-important manner, as if she did not fear him in the least. She was\nreally an intolerable creature, that goat Crookhorn! But just let her\ndare--!\n\nBearhunter felt that he must sit on the cold doorstep for some time\nlonger, at any rate. He glanced up the road occasionally as if to see\nwhether any one was coming, so that the pigs and goats might not think\nthey had the whole of his attention.\n\nHe had just turned his head leisurely toward the narrow road that came\ndown crosswise over the slope from the Upper Farms, when--what in the\nworld was that!\n\nSomething _was_ coming,--a funny little roly-poly something. What a\npity, thought Bearhunter, that his sight was growing so poor! At any\nrate, he had better give the people in the house warning.\n\nSo he gave several deep, echoing barks. The goats sprang together in a\nclump and raised their ears; the pigs stopped in the very midst of\ntheir scratching to listen. That Bearhunter was held in great respect\ncould easily be seen.\n\nHe still remained sitting on the doorstep, staring up the road. Never\nin his life had he seen such a thing as that now approaching. Perhaps,\nafter all, it was nothing worth giving warning about. He would take a\nturn up the road and look at it a little nearer. So, arching his bushy\ntail into a handsome curve and putting on his most good-humored\nexpression, he sauntered off.\n\nYes, it must be a human being, although you would not think so. It\nbegan to look very much like \"Katrine the Finn,\" as they called her,\nwho came to the farm every winter; but it could not be Katrine--it was\naltogether too little. It wore a long, wide skirt, and from under the\nskirt protruded the tips of two big shoes covered with gray woolen\nstocking feet from which the legs had been cut off. Above the skirt\nthere was a round bundle of clothes with a knitted shawl tied around\nit, and from this protruded two stumps with red mittens on. Perched on\nthe top of all was a smaller shape, muffled up in a smaller knitted\nshawl,--that, of course, must be the head. Carried at the back was a\nhuge bundle tied up in a dark cloth, and in front hung a pretty wooden\npail, painted red.\n\nReally, Bearhunter had to stand still and gaze. The strange figure, in\nthe meantime, had become aware of him, and it also came to a\nstandstill, as if in a dilemma. At that, Bearhunter walked over to the\nfarther side of the road and took his station there, trying to look\nindifferent, for he did not wish to cause any fright. The strange\nfigure then made its way carefully forward again, drawing gradually\ncloser and closer to its own side of the road. As it came nearer to\nBearhunter the figure turned itself around by degrees, until, when\ndirectly opposite to him, it walked along quite sidewise.\n\nThen it was that Bearhunter got a peep through a little opening in the\nupper shawl; and there he saw the tip of a tiny, turned-up red nose,\nthen a red mouth that was drawn down a little at the corners as if\nready for crying, and then a pair of big blue eyes that were fastened\nupon him with a look of terror.\n\n[Illustration: HOEL FARM]\n\nPooh! it was nothing, after all, but a little girl, well bundled up\nagainst the cold. Bearhunter did not know her--but wait a bit! he\nthought he had seen that pail before. At any rate it would be absurd to\ntry to frighten this queer little creature.\n\nHis tail began to wag involuntarily as he walked across the road to\ntake a sniff at the pail.\n\nThe little girl did not understand his action at once. Stepping back in\nalarm, she caught her heels in her long frock and down she tumbled by\nthe side of the road. Bearhunter darted off instantly; but after\nrunning a short distance toward the house he stopped and looked at her\nagain, making his eyes as gentle as he could and wagging his tail\nenergetically. With Bearhunter that wagging of the tail meant hearty,\ngood-natured laughter.\n\nThen the little girl understood. She got up, smiled, and jogged slowly\nafter him. Bearhunter trotted leisurely ahead, looking back at her from\ntime to time. He knew now that she had an errand at Hoel Farm, and that\nhe was therefore in duty bound to help her.\n\nThus it was that Lisbeth Longfrock of Peerout Castle made her entrance\ninto Hoel Farm.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nPeerout Castle was perched high above the Upper Farms, on a crag that\njutted out from a barren ridge just under a mountain peak called \"The\nBig Hammer.\" The real name of the little farm was New Ridge,[1] and\n\"Peerout Castle\" was only a nickname given to it by a joker because\nthere was so fine an outlook from it and because it bore no resemblance\nwhatever to a castle. The royal lands belonging to this castle\nconsisted of a little plot of cultivated soil, a bit of meadow land\nhere and there, and some heather patches where tiny blueberry bushes\nand small mountain-cranberry plants grew luxuriantly. The castle's\noutbuildings were a shabby cow house and a pigsty. The cow house was\nbuilt against the steep hillside, with three walls of loosely built\nstone, and its two stalls were dug half their length into the hill. The\ntiny pigsty was built in the same fashion.\n\n      [1] It is customary in Norway for each farm, however small, to\n      have a name.\n\nAs for the castle itself, that was a very, very small, turf-roofed\ncabin lying out on the jutting crag in the middle of the rocky ridge.\nIt had only one small window, with tiny panes of glass, that looked out\nover the valley. And yet, in whatever part of the surrounding country\none might be, by looking in that direction--and looking high\nenough--one could always see that little castle, with its single window\npeering out like a watchful eye over the landscape.\n\nSince the castle from which Lisbeth Longfrock came was no more\nmagnificent than this, it may easily be understood that she was no\ndisguised princess, but only a poor little girl. Coming to Hoel Farm\nfor the first time was for her like visiting an estate that was, in\nvery truth, royal; and besides, she had come on an important \"grown-up\"\nerrand. She was taking her mother's place and visiting Hoel as a\nspinning woman.\n\nLisbeth's mother, whose name was Randi,[2] had worked hard for the last\nfour years to get food for herself and her children up at Peerout\nCastle. Before that the family had been in very comfortable\ncircumstances; but the father had died, leaving the mother with the\ncastle, one cow, and the care of the two children. The children were\nJacob, at that time about six years old, and Lisbeth, a couple of years\nyounger. Life was often a hard struggle for the mother; but they had,\nat any rate, a house over their heads, and they could get wood without\nhaving to go very far for it, since the forest lay almost within a\nstone's throw.\n\n      [2] (In the original, Roennaug.) This was the mother's first\n      name. Her full name would be Randi Newridge, or Randi Peerout.\n\nIn the summer Randi managed to dig up her tiny plots of ground after a\nfashion, so that she could harvest a few potatoes and a little grain.\nBy cutting grass and stripping off birch leaves she had thus far\nmanaged each year to give Bliros, their cow, enough to eat. And where\nthere is a cow there is always food.\n\nIn the winter she spun linen and wool for the women on the farms far\nand near, but as she had lived at Hoel Farm as a servant before she was\nmarried, it was natural that most of her spinning should be for\nKjersti[3] Hoel.\n\n      [3] Kyare'-stee.\n\nIn such ways had Randi been able to care for her family. Meanwhile\nJacob, now ten years old, had grown big enough to earn his own living.\nIn the spring before the last a message had come from Nordrum Farm that\na boy was needed to look after the flocks, and Jacob had at once\napplied and been accepted. He and Lisbeth had often knelt on the long\nwooden bench under the little window at Peerout Castle, and gazed upon\nthe different farms, choosing which they would work on when they were\nbig enough. Jacob had always chosen Nordrum Farm,--probably because he\nhad heard Farmer Nordrum spoken of as the big man of the community;\nwhile Lisbeth had always thought that it would be pleasanter at Hoel\nFarm because it was owned by a woman.\n\nWhen autumn came Farmer Nordrum had concluded that he would have use\nfor such a boy as Jacob during the winter also, and so Jacob had stayed\non. This last Christmas, however, he had gone home for the whole day\nand had taken with him a Christmas present for his sister from a little\ngirl at Nordrum. The present was a gray woolen frock,--a very nice one.\n\nJacob had grown extremely pleasant and full of fun while at Nordrum,\nLisbeth thought. When she tried the frock on and it reached way down to\nthe ground before and behind, he called her \"Lisbeth Longfrock\" and\nLisbeth Longfrock she had remained from that day.\n\nAfter Christmas, times had been somewhat harder at Peerout Castle.\nBliros, who generally gave milk the whole year round, had become dry,\nand would not give milk for several months. She was to have a calf in\nthe early summer. During the last few weeks there had not been milk\nenough even for Randi's and Lisbeth's coffee.\n\nTo go to Svehaugen,[4] the nearest farm, for milk was no short trip;\nand milk was scarce there too, as Randi well knew. Besides, she could\nnot spare the time to go. She had to finish spinning Kjersti Hoel's\nwool. When she once got that off her hands, they could have plenty of\nmilk for their coffee, and other good things besides. What a relief it\nwould be when that time came!\n\n      [4] Sva-howg-en.\n\nSo Randi worked steadily at her spinning, Lisbeth being now big enough\nto help in carding the wool. For a week she spun almost without\nceasing, scarcely taking time for meals, but drinking a good deal of\nstrong black coffee. Not until very late one evening was Kjersti Hoel's\nwool all spun and ready. By that time Randi was far from well. Whether\nor not her illness was caused, as she thought, by drinking so much\nblack coffee, certain it is that when Kjersti Hoel's wool was all spun\nRandi felt a tightness in her chest, and when she got up the next\nmorning and tried to get ready to go to Hoel with the spinning, she was\nseized with such a sudden dizziness that she had to go back to bed\nagain. She was too weak for anything else.\n\nNow it was the custom in Norway for the spinning woman to take back to\nthe different farms the wool she had spun, and for the farmers' wives\nto praise her work, treat her to something good to eat and drink, pay\nher, and then give her directions about the way the next spinning was\nto be done. All this Randi would have to give up for the present--there\nwas no help for it; but she wondered how it would do to send Lisbeth to\nHoel Farm in her stead. The little girl would find her way safely,\nRandi was sure, although Randi had never as yet taken her to that farm\nbecause it was so far off. The payment for the spinning was to be in\neatables as well as money, and Lisbeth could bring home part of what\nwas due. Then, though they still might lack many things, their drop of\ncoffee could have cream in it, as coffee ought to have. The remainder\nof the payment and the directions for the next spinning Randi herself\ncould get when she was better.\n\nIf she could only be sure that Lisbeth would behave properly and not\nact like a changeling, a troll child!\n\nLisbeth eagerly promised that if her mother would allow her to go she\nwould behave exactly as a spinning woman should,--she would, really!\nAnd she remembered perfectly well just how everything was done that\ntime she had gone with her mother to one of the nearer farms.\n\nSo Lisbeth put on her long frock, which was used only for very best,\nand her mother wrapped her up snugly in the two shawls. Then the bundle\nof yarn was slung over her back, the pail was hung in front, many\ndirections were given to her about the road, and off she started.\n\nAnd that is the way Lisbeth Longfrock happened to come toddling after\nBearhunter to Hoel Farm on that clear, cold winter's day toward the\nbeginning of spring.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nLISBETH LONGFROCK AS SPINNING WOMAN\n\n\nWhen Lisbeth found herself in the farm dooryard, with the different\nbuildings all about her, she really had to stand still and gaze around.\nOh, how large everything was!--quite on another scale from things at\nhome. Why, the barn door was so broad and high that Peerout Castle\ncould easily go right through it, and each windowpane in the big house\nwas as large as their own whole window. And such a goat!--for just then\nshe caught sight of Crookhorn, who had come warily up to the doorway,\nand who only saw fit to draw back as Bearhunter approached. Not that\nCrookhorn was afraid of Bearhunter,--no, indeed!\n\nThe goat was larger than most goats,--about as large as a good-sized\ncalf. If the cows belonging to Hoel Farm were as much larger than\nordinary cows, thought Lisbeth, they would be able to eat grass from\nthe roof of Peerout Castle while standing, just as usual, on the\nground.[5] She glanced searchingly at the cow-house door. No, it was\nnot larger than such doors usually were, so the cows were evidently no\nbigger than other cows.\n\n      [5] Norwegian children in country districts are accustomed to see\n      goats walking about on the roofs of turf-covered huts, nibbling\n      the herbage; but the idea of a creature so large as to be able to\n      eat from the roof while standing on the ground was very\n      astonishing to Lisbeth.\n\nBearhunter had followed after Crookhorn until the latter was well out\nof the way; then he had come back again, and now stood wagging his tail\nand turning toward the house door as if coaxing Lisbeth to go in. Yes,\nshe must attend to her errand and not stay out there staring at\neverything.\n\nSo she followed after Bearhunter and went into the hall way. She lifted\nthe latch of the inner door, turned herself around carefully as she\nwent in so as to make room for her bundle, fastened the door behind\nher--and there she stood inside the big kitchen at Hoel!\n\n[Illustration: THE BIG KITCHEN AT HOEL FARM]\n\nThere were only two people in the kitchen,--one a young servant maid in\nthe middle of the room spinning, and the other the mistress herself,\nKjersti Hoel, over by the white wall of the big open fireplace,\ngrinding coffee.\n\nBoth looked up when they heard the door open.\n\nLisbeth Longfrock stood still for a moment, then made a deep courtesy\nunder her long frock and said in a grown-up way, just as she had heard\nher mother say, \"Good day, and God bless your work.\"\n\nKjersti Hoel had to smile when she saw the little roly-poly bundle over\nby the door, talking in such a grown-up fashion. But she answered as\nsoberly as if she also were talking to a grown-up person: \"Good day. Is\nthis a young stranger out for a walk?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And what is the stranger's name, and where is she from? I see that I\ndo not know her.\"\n\n\"No, you could not be expected to. My mother and Jacob call me Lisbeth\nLongfrock, and I am from Peerout Castle. Mother sent me here with the\nwoolen yarn she has spun for you. She told me to say that she could not\ncome with it before, for she did not get the last spool wound until\nlate last night.\"\n\n\"Indeed! Can it be a spinning woman we have here? And to think that I\nwholly forgot to ask you to sit down after your long walk! You really\nmust take off your things and stay awhile.\"\n\nWhat a pleasant woman Kjersti Hoel was! She got up from her own chair\nand set one forward for Lisbeth.\n\n\"Thank you; I shall be glad to sit down,\" said Lisbeth.\n\nShe took off the pail and the bundle of wool and put them down by the\ndoor, and then began to walk across the floor over to the chair. It\nseemed as if she would never get there, so far was it across the big\nkitchen,--nearly as far as from their own door to the cow-house door at\nPeerout Castle. At last, however, she reached the chair; but it was\nhigher than the seats she was accustomed to and she could barely\nscramble up on one corner of it.\n\nKjersti Hoel came toward her.\n\n\"I really think I must open this roly-poly bundle and see what is in\nit,\" said she; and she began to take off Lisbeth's red mittens and to\nundo the knitted shawls. Soon Lisbeth sat there stripped of all her\nouter toggery, but nevertheless looking almost as plump and roly-poly\nas ever; for not only did her long frock barely clear the ground at the\nbottom, but its band reached almost up under her arms.\n\nKjersti stood and looked at her a moment.\n\n\"That is just what I thought,--that I should find a nice little girl\ninside all those clothes. You look like your mother.\"\n\nAt this Lisbeth grew so shy that she forgot all about being a spinning\nwoman. She cast down her eyes and could not say a word.\n\n\"But what is the matter with Randi, your mother?\" continued Kjersti.\n\"Why could she not come herself?\"\n\n\"She was a little poorly to-day.\"\n\n\"Indeed! Randi not well? And her health is generally so good. What ails\nher?\"\n\n\"Oh, she thought that very likely drinking strong coffee without milk\nhad not been good for her.\"\n\n\"So you have no milk at your house. Perhaps that is why you have\nbrought a pail with you.\"\n\n\"Yes; what do you think! Bliros has stopped giving us milk this\nwinter.\"\n\n\"Has she, indeed! That is rather inconvenient, isn't it? How long\nbefore she can be milked again?\"\n\n\"Not until the beginning of summer, after she has had her calf.\"\n\n\"H'm,\" said Kjersti thoughtfully. By and by, as if to herself, she\nsaid: \"I have often thought of going to see Randi, but have never done\nso. Before this spring is over, I must surely pay her a visit.\"\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nLisbeth Longfrock stayed a long time at Hoel that day. Although she had\ncome in the important character of spinning woman, she had never\nimagined that a great person like Kjersti Hoel would be so pleasant and\nkind to her. Kjersti treated her to coffee and cakes and milk and other\ngood things, just as if she had been an invited guest, and chatted with\nher in such a way that Lisbeth forgot all about being shy. And oh, how\nmany curious things Kjersti showed her!\n\nThe cow house was the finest of them all. There were so many cows that\nLisbeth could scarcely count them. And then the pigs and sheep and\ngoats! and hens, too, inside a big latticework inclosure,--nearly as\nmany of them as there were crows in autumn up at Peerout!\n\nAnd Kjersti wanted to know about _everything_,--whether Lisbeth could\nread and write (she could do both, for Jacob had taught her), and how\nthey managed about food up at Peerout Castle, and how it went with the\nfarming.\n\nLisbeth could tell her that in the autumn they had gathered three\nbarrels of potatoes, and one barrel and three pecks of mixed grain; and\nthat they had stripped off so many birch leaves that they had fodder\nenough to carry Bliros through the winter,--in fact, much more than\nenough.\n\nWhen Kjersti had shown Lisbeth the sheep and the goats, she declared\nthat she should certainly need a little girl to look after her flocks\nwhen spring came; and then Lisbeth, before she knew what she was\nsaying, told Kjersti how she and Jacob used to look at the farms from\nthe window at home, and how she had always chosen Hoel as the place\nwhere she should like to work when she was big enough.\n\n\"Should you really like to go out to work?\" Kjersti inquired.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" Lisbeth said, \"if it were not for leaving mother.\"\n\n\"Well, we will not think about that any more at present,\" said Kjersti,\n\"but I will go up and talk with your mother about it some time in the\nspring. We certainly ought to go into the house now, so that you can\nhave time to take a little food before leaving. It is drawing toward\nevening and you will have to start for home soon.\"\n\nSo they went into the house again, and Lisbeth had another feast of\ngood things. While she was eating she noticed that Kjersti brought from\nthe cellar some butter and cheese and other things and packed them in\nthe dark cloth in which the wool had been tied. The milk pail she did\nnot touch at all; but Lisbeth saw that she said something about it\nsoftly to the servant maid, after which the maid left the room.\n\nWhen Lisbeth had eaten and had said \"Thanks and praise for both food\nand drink,\" Kjersti remarked: \"Now you must lift the bundle over there\nand see if you can carry it.\"\n\nThe bundle _was_ rather heavy. Still, Lisbeth thought she could manage\nit. But the pail! Not a word did Kjersti say, even now, about the pail!\nShe only added, kindly, \"Come, and I will help you put on your things.\"\n\nShe drew on Lisbeth's mittens, wrapped her up snugly in the two little\nshawls, and, in a trice, there stood Lisbeth Longfrock looking exactly\nas she did when she had come to Hoel that morning.\n\nSlowly and reluctantly Lisbeth went toward the door, where the pail\nstill stood. How strange that Kjersti had not even yet said a single\nword about it! Lisbeth stood for a moment in doubt. After receiving so\nmuch, it would never do to remind Kjersti about the pail; but she would\nmuch rather have gone without the good things she herself had been\ntreated to than to go home without any milk for her mother's coffee.\n\nShe took up the bundle, drew her face with its turned-up nose tip back\ninto its little shawl as far as she could so that Kjersti should not\nsee the tears in her eyes, and then bent down and lifted the pail.\n\nAt that Kjersti said: \"Oh, yes! the pail! I quite forgot it. Are you\nwilling to exchange pails with me if I give you one that will never get\nempty?\"\n\nLisbeth dropped her pail plump on the floor. She had seen and heard\nmany curious things on this eventful day,--things she had never seen or\nthought of before; but that Kjersti, besides everything else, had a\npail that would never get empty! She stood and stared, open-mouthed.\n\n\"Yes, you must come and see it,\" said Kjersti. \"It stands just outside\nthe door.\"\n\nLisbeth was not slow in making her way out. Kjersti followed her. There\nstood the servant maid, holding the big goat, Crookhorn, by a rope.\n\n\"The goat is used to being led,\" said Kjersti, \"so you will have no\ntrouble in taking it home. Give my greetings to your mother, and ask\nher if she is satisfied with the exchange of pails.\"\n\nKjersti was not a bit displeased because Lisbeth Longfrock forgot to\nexpress her thanks as she started off with Crookhorn. Bearhunter\nfollowed the little girl and the goat a long distance up the road. He\ndid not understand matters at all!\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nIt is not to be wondered at that Randi, too, was greatly surprised when\nshe saw Crookhorn following after Lisbeth as the little girl approached\nthe castle.\n\nThere was not time for Lisbeth to tell about everything at the very\nfirst, for her mother and she had to clear up the stall next to the one\nBliros occupied, and put Crookhorn into it. When this was done they\nfelt exactly as if they had two cows. The goat took her place in the\nstall with a self-important, superior air, quite as if she were a real\ncow and had never done anything else but stand in a cow stall. Bliros\nbecame offended at this remarkable newcomer, who was putting on such\nairs in the cow house that had always belonged to herself alone, and so\nshe made a lunge with her head and tried to hook the goat with her\nhorns; but Crookhorn merely turned her own horns against those of\nBliros in the most indifferent manner, as if quite accustomed to being\nhooked by cows.\n\nBliros gazed at her in astonishment. Such a silly goat! She had never\nseen such a silly goat. And with that she turned her head to the wall\nagain and did not give Crookhorn another look.\n\nThat evening Lisbeth Longfrock had so many things to tell her mother\nthat she talked herself fast asleep!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nLEAVING PEEROUT CASTLE\n\n\nThe next time Lisbeth Longfrock came to Hoel Farm, she did not come\nalone; and she came--to stay!\n\nAll that had happened between that first visit and her second coming\nhad been far, far different from anything Lisbeth had ever imagined. It\nseemed as if there had been no time for her to think about the strange\nevents while they were taking place. She did not realize what their\nresult would be until after she had lived through them and gone out of\nthe gate of Peerout Castle when everything was over. So much had been\ngoing on in those last sad, solemn days,--so much that was new to see\nand to hear,--that although she had felt a lump in her throat the whole\ntime, she had not had a real cry until at the very end. But when she\nhad passed through the gate that last day, and had stopped and looked\nback, the picture that she then saw had brought the whole clearly\nbefore her, with all its sorrow. Something was gone that would never\ncome again. She would never again go to Peerout Castle except as a\nstranger. She had no home--no home anywhere. And at that she had begun\nto weep so bitterly that those who had been thinking how wisely and\nquietly she was taking her trouble could but stand and look at her in\nwonder.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nThe last two months of the winter had passed so quickly up at Peerout\nCastle that Lisbeth really could not tell what had become of them; and\nthis was owing not a little to the fact that, besides all her other\nwork, she had so much to do in the cow house.\n\nCrookhorn had become, as it were, Lisbeth's cow, and consequently had\nto be taken care of by her. Bliros showed very plainly that she would\nnot like at all to have Randi's attentions bestowed upon a rascally\ngoat. That would make it seem as if the goat were fully as important a\nperson in the cow house as Bliros herself; whereas the whole cow house,\nin reality, belonged to her, and that other creature was only allowed\nthere as a favor.\n\nSo Lisbeth took care of Crookhorn exactly as she saw her mother take\ncare of Bliros. In fact, before long she had more to do in the cow\nhouse than her mother had; for she soon learned to milk Crookhorn,\nwhile Bliros, her mother's cow, could not then be milked.\n\nAnd Crookhorn gave so much milk! Three times a day Lisbeth had to milk\nher. There was no longer any scarcity of cream for coffee or milk for\nporridge. Indeed, there was even cream enough to make waffles with now\nand then.\n\nSpringtime came. It always came early up at Peerout Castle. The slopes\nof heather, directly facing the sun, were the first in the whole valley\nto peep up out of the snow. As soon as the heathery spots began to show\nthemselves, Lisbeth was out on them, stepping here and there with a\ncautious foot. It seemed so wonderful to step on bare earth again\ninstead of snow! Day by day she kept track of the different green\npatches, watching them grow larger and larger, and seeing how the snow\nglided slowly farther and farther downward,--exactly as her own frock\ndid when she loosened the band and let it slip down and lie in a ring\naround her feet. When the snow had slipped as far down as the big stone\nwhere she and Jacob used to have their cow house (using pine cones for\ncows and sheep), the outermost buds on the trees would swell and be\nready to burst,--she knew that from the year before; and when the buds\nhad really opened (she kept close watch of them every day now), then,\n_then_ would come the great day when Crookhorn could be let out.\nLisbeth's mother had said so.\n\nThat great day was what she was waiting for, not only because it would\nbe so pleasant for Crookhorn to be out, but because no food was equal\nto the first buds of spring for making goats yield rich milk.\n\nLisbeth's mother had been far from well ever since the day that Lisbeth\nwent over to Hoel Farm for the first time. But Lisbeth thought that as\nsoon as Crookhorn had fresh buds to eat and gave richer milk, her\nmother would of course get entirely well.\n\nIt is very possible that a little streak of snow was still lying by the\nupper side of the big stone (in spite of Lisbeth's having scattered\nsand there to make the snow melt faster) on the bright spring day when\nLisbeth went into the cow house, unfastened Crookhorn, and led her out\nof the stall.\n\nAs for Crookhorn, she followed her little mistress very sedately until\nthey reached the cow-house door. There she stopped short, looking\naround and blinking at the sun. Lisbeth pulled at the rope, trying to\ndrag her over to the part of the ridge where the birch tree with the\nfullest leaf buds stood. But Crookhorn would not budge. She merely\nstood stock-still as if nothing were being done to her; for she was so\nstrong that, however hard Lisbeth pulled, it did not even make her\nstretch her neck. Lisbeth then went nearer, thinking that she could\npull better without such a length of rope between her and the goat; but\nat that, quick as a wink, Crookhorn lowered her head and butted\nLisbeth, causing the little girl to fall back against the hillside with\na whack. Upon which, Crookhorn stalked in an indifferent manner across\nthe road.\n\nLisbeth picked herself up and started to go after her charge; but, if\nyou please, as soon as she came near enough and tried to seize\nCrookhorn, away would that naughty goat dart, not galloping as a goat\nusually does, but trotting like a cow or an elk. She trotted by the\nhouse and turned off on the road leading to Svehaugen Farm. Lisbeth\npursued swiftly; but, run as she might, she could not gain upon\nCrookhorn. At last, stumbling over a stone, the little girl fell at\nfull length, having barely time, while falling, to look up and catch a\nglimpse of Crookhorn's back as the goat, trotting swiftly, disappeared\nover the brow of a hill.\n\nThere was no other way out of it,--Lisbeth would have to run home and\nget her mother to help her. This she did, and they both set out in full\nchase. It was a long run, for they did not overtake Crookhorn until\nthey had reached the Svehaugen gate. There stood the goat gazing\nunconcernedly through the palings. She evidently felt herself superior\nto jumping over fences,--she who imagined herself to be a cow!\n\nRandi had become much overheated from running, and at night, when she\nwent to bed, she said she felt cold and shivery. That seemed very\nstrange indeed to Lisbeth, for when she laid her face against her\nmother's neck, it was as hot as a burning coal.\n\nIn the morning Lisbeth's mother woke her and told her to get up and go\nover to Kari Svehaugen's and ask Kari to come to Peerout Castle. Randi\nfelt so poorly that there was no use in her even trying to get up. She\nwas not able.\n\nNot able to get up! That also seemed very strange to Lisbeth, for never\nbefore had she seen her mother with cheeks so red and eyes so shining.\nThe child did not say anything, however, but got up, dressed herself\nquickly and quietly, and ran off to Svehaugen.\n\nAfter that there came several wonderful days at Peerout Castle. When\nLisbeth Longfrock thought about them afterward, they seemed like a\nsingle long day in which a great many things had happened that she\ncould not separate from one another and set in order. In her\nremembrance it was as if shadows had glided to and fro in an ugly\nyellow light, while the sound of a heavy, painful breathing was\nconstantly heard, penetrating all other sounds.\n\nShe seemed dimly to see Kari Svehaugen gliding about and taking care of\nthings in the home and out in the cow house. She herself had climbed a\nbirch tree several times and picked leaf buds for the animals to eat.\nOne day Lars Svehaugen had flitted along the road in front of the\nhouse, swiftly, as if he had not a moment to spare. Soon after this,\nsome one dressed in furs and with big boots on came driving to the\nhouse, and all the neighbors flocked around him, listening to what he\nsaid. And he brought such a curious smell with him! It filled the whole\nhouse, so that, even after he had gone away, he seemed to be still\nthere.\n\nShe thought, too, that once she had seen Kjersti Hoel sitting on a\nchair, taking many good things out of a big basket, and Jacob standing\nby Kjersti's side with a great slice of raisin cake in his hand. And\nJacob had kept chewing and chewing on his raisin cake, as if it was\nhard work to get it down. What she remembered chiefly, though, was\nJacob's eyes,--they looked so big and strange.\n\nThen one morning she had awakened in a clear gray light, and from that\ntime she remembered everything very distinctly. She was lying in the\nlittle trundle-bed that Jacob had slept in when he lived at home,--she\nmust, of course, have slept in it all these nights,--and Kari Svehaugen\nwas standing beside it, looking down upon her. The house was oh! so\nstill,--she did not hear the heavy, painful breathing any longer. The\nonly sound was a slight crackling in the fireplace, out of which a\nstream of warmth issued.\n\nKari said very quietly: \"Your mother is comfortable and happy now,\nlittle Lisbeth; better off than she has ever been before. So you must\nnot cry.\"\n\nAnd Lisbeth did not cry. She merely got up and went about the house\nvery, very quietly all that first day. Afterwards there were so many\npreparations being made for some solemn festival that she did not seem\nto get time to think about the great change that had taken place.\n\nLars Svehaugen came from the storekeeper's with ever so much fine\nwhite, shining cloth,--she had never seen the like. Then a woman came\nto help Kari cut out and sew, and they made pillows and a fine white\ngarment that mother was to have on when she lay upon the pillows. And\nLars Svehaugen began to make a new wooden bed for mother to lie in; and\nBliros had her calf, and the calf was slaughtered; and Lars Svehaugen\nbrought some small pine trees and nailed them at the gateposts and\noutside the house door, one at each side, and he strewed pine branches\nall the way from the door to the gate. And there came presents of\nfood--oh! so many good things--from Kjersti Hoel and others. Lisbeth\nhad never tasted such delicious food before.\n\nThen came the day when mother was to be taken to the church and buried.\nMany people came to the house that day,--among them Jacob in a bright\nnew suit of gray woolen homespun; and there was a feast for them all,\nand everything was very still and solemn. Even the schoolmaster came;\nand oh, how beautifully he sang when Lars Svehaugen and three other men\ncarried mother out through the door and set her couch upon a sledge.\n\nThen they all went slowly away from the house, down the hill,--the\nsledge first and the people walking slowly behind. But down at the\nbottom of the hill, in the road, there stood two horses and wagons\nwaiting; and, just think! Lisbeth and Jacob were invited to sit up in\nKjersti Hoel's broad wagon and drive with her.\n\nThen they came to the white church; and as they carried mother in\nthrough the big gateway the church bells up in the tower rang, oh, so\nbeautifully!\n\nAfter that Lisbeth did not see things quite so clearly, but they\nlowered mother down into the earth in the churchyard and strewed\nwreaths of green heather over her, and then the schoolmaster sang\nagain, and all the men took off their hats and held them a long time\nbefore their faces.\n\nAfter that the people went out of the churchyard, and Lisbeth and Jacob\nclimbed into Kjersti Hoel's broad wagon again and drove away,--only\nthis time they drove much faster. It looked as if the boards in the\nfences ran after each other in an opposite direction from the one in\nwhich she and Jacob were going. They both tried to count them, but\ncould not.\n\nAll the people came back with them to Peerout Castle,--Kjersti Hoel,\ntoo. Kari Svehaugen, who had not gone to the church, had covered the\ntable with a white tablecloth, and set it with plates and good things\nto eat. And all the people ate and talked,--but they did not talk very\nloudly.\n\nWhen the meal was over, Lisbeth got Jacob to go out into the cow house\nto look at Crookhorn. Jacob conceded that the goat was an extremely\nfine animal, but she was a vixen, he was sure,--he could tell that by\nher eyelids.\n\nThen they went over to the hill to look at the mill wheel that Jacob\nused to have there; but it had fallen into complete decay because he\nhad been away from home so long. Such things need a boy's personal\nattention.\n\nAfter that they were called into the house again and everybody drank\ncoffee. When they had finished the coffee drinking, Kari began packing\ninto baskets the food that was left; and when that was done, Kjersti\nHoel said: \"Well, now we have done everything that we can here. You may\nbring Crookhorn with you, Lisbeth, and come to live with me. That was\nthe last thing I promised your mother.\"\n\nThus had it come about that Lisbeth Longfrock, holding Crookhorn by a\nrope, stood outside the gate at Peerout Castle with Kjersti Hoel and\nBearhunter; and then it was that she looked behind her and began to\ncry.\n\nOn one road she saw Kari Svehaugen with a big basket on her arm and\nBliros following her; and on the other she saw the back of Jacob, with\nwhom she had just shaken hands, saying, \"May you fare well.\" He looked\nsingularly small and forlorn.\n\nLast of all she saw Lars Svehaugen put a pine twig in the door latch as\na sign that Peerout Castle was now closed, locked, and forsaken.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nSPRING: LETTING THE ANIMALS OUT TO PASTURE\n\n\nOne morning, a few weeks after the sad departure from Peerout Castle,\nLisbeth Longfrock awoke early in the small sleeping room built under\nthe great staircase at Hoel. She opened her eyes wide at the moment of\nwaking, and tried to gather her thoughts together. She was conscious of\na delightful, quivering expectancy, and felt that she had awakened to\nsomething great and new,--something that she had waited for and been\nexceedingly glad over; but she could not at once remember just what it\nwas.\n\nThe little room, whose only furniture consisted of a bed, a chair, a\nstove, and a small wooden shelf with a mirror over it, was filled with\ndaylight in spite of the early hour. The sun fell slanting down through\na window set high up in the wall directly over Lisbeth's bed, and the\nwindowpanes were pictured in bright yellow squares on the floor near\nthe tiny stove. The corner of one square spread itself against the\nstove, and Lisbeth traced it with her eyes as she lay in bed. At the\ntip of the corner glimmered something light-green and shiny. Was it\nfrom there that a fine, wonderful fragrance came floating toward her?\nShe sniffed a little. Yes, indeed! now she remembered. The fragrance\ncame from the fresh birch twigs she had decorated the room with\nyesterday. Out of doors it was spring,--the sprouting, bursting\nspringtime. To-day the cattle were to be let out and the calves named.\nTo-day she would begin work in earnest and be a responsible individual.\nIn short, she would be the herd girl at Hoel Farm.\n\nIt was now a month since Lisbeth had come to Hoel Farm, but up to this\ntime she had been treated merely as company. She had walked about the\nplace, sauntered after Kjersti here and there in the house, ground the\ncoffee, and brought out from a bowl in the pantry the small cakes that\nthey ate with their coffee every afternoon. Frequently, too, she had\nhad pleasant talks with Kjersti.\n\nAs for helping with the animals,--the sheep and the goats had been let\nout, to be sure, but nevertheless they did not need her care because\nthey were allowed, so early in the season, to run about everywhere\nexcept in the garden, and that Bearhunter stood guard over. In the cow\nhouse there was nothing for her to do, for a milkmaid and an\nunder-milkmaid did the work there. Of course the girl who tended the\nflocks ought really to be able to help in milking the cows; but it was\nthought that Lisbeth had better wait a year before she tried to do\nthat,--her hands being rather too small as yet. Lisbeth had kept\nmeasuring her hands every now and then and pulling her fingers to make\nthem grow; and after a while she had asked the milkmaid if she did not\nthink they had grown large enough, but the milkmaid did not see that\nthey were any larger. She could not have very good eyes!\n\nLisbeth had, of course, expected to take care of Crookhorn,--Kjersti\nand she both thought she ought to do that; but it had proved to be\nimpossible. Crookhorn had become so freakish that sometimes they almost\nthought her out of her wits. In the building shared by the sheep and\ngoats she ranged back and forth from wall to wall, knocking against the\nsheep and the other goats so hard as she went that their ribs rattled.\nAt last she had to be tied to one of the walls, and with the shortest\nrope possible at that. Nor would she allow herself to be milked\npeaceably in that building. The first time Lisbeth tried it, Crookhorn,\nwith a toss of the head, gave a kick that sent Lisbeth and the pail\nrolling off in different directions. Afterward the milkmaid herself\ntook Crookhorn in hand at milking time; but even for her it was always\na feat of strength, and she had to have some one to help her by holding\nthe goat's horns.\n\nWhen Crookhorn was let out with the other goats, would she ramble with\nthem over the fields and meadows, seeking food? No, indeed! She would\nstation herself poutingly by the cow-house door and stand there the\nlivelong day,--\"bellowing like a cow\" the farm boy said; and then in\nthe evening, when the other goats came home plump and well fed, there\nCrookhorn would stand as thin and hungry as a wolf.\n\nLisbeth thought that Crookhorn, if provided with a stall in the cow\nhouse, would act like a reasonable creature again. But neither Kjersti\nnor the milkmaid would consent to the removal; they thought a goat\nought not to be humored in such unreasonable fancies.\n\nThus it was that Lisbeth had not had much to do during her first month\nat Hoel Farm. The only thing that Kjersti had required of her was to\nkeep her own little room under the hall staircase in nice order, and\nthat she had done. Every day she had made the bed herself, and every\nSaturday she had washed the floor and the shelf, and spread juniper\ntwigs about. Last Saturday Kjersti had come out to take a look at it,\nand had said to her that she kept her room in better order than the\ngrown-up girls in the south chamber kept theirs; and Lisbeth knew that\nthis was true, for she had noticed it herself.\n\n[Illustration: LISBETH'S ROOM UNDER THE STAIRS]\n\nBut now everything was going to be different. Kjersti Hoel had come to\nLisbeth's room the night before and said that the cows were to be let\nout early in the morning, and that Lisbeth, like all the rest of the\nHoel Farm people, must be up early to help. Later in the day the calves\nthat had been born in the cow house during the winter were to be let\nout for the first time, and Lisbeth would have to look after them for\nthat afternoon at any rate. Kjersti had said also that Lisbeth was to\nbe allowed to give the calves their names,--names that they would keep\nall their lives, even after they had grown to be full-sized cows.\n\nThe next day after the letting out of the animals Lisbeth was to take a\nlunch bag and begin her spring work of going into the forest all day to\nwatch the sheep and goats. It would not do to have them running about\nthe fields at home any longer, Kjersti said.\n\nSuddenly Lisbeth recollected what it was that she had pondered over so\nlong as she lay awake the evening before,--it was the names of the\ncalves. In spite of all her pondering she had got no farther than to\nwonder whether the cow with the red sides and white head and the gentle\nbut bright-looking face should not be called Bliros. That idea,\nhowever, she had given up; it seemed to her that only one cow in the\nworld could be called Bliros. Then she had determined to think no\nlonger about Bliros or the names of the calves, and so had fallen\nasleep.\n\nWhat if she had overslept herself now! She hoped not, with all her\nheart, for she had heard Kjersti Hoel say that she did not like girls\nto lie abed late and dally in the morning. How mortifying it would be\nfor her not to be on the spot as early as the others to-day, her very\nfirst working day!\n\nWide-awake now, Lisbeth hopped quickly out of bed and popped into her\nlong frock. Then, having made her bed[6] with all haste, she opened the\ndoor, went out through the hall way, and stood on the outside steps.\n\n      [6] Lisbeth meant to be very neat and tidy, but she should have\n      let her bed air longer before making it!\n\nThe sun had just risen above the highest spruce tops over the edge of\nthe eastern hills, and the light was flooding the sides of the valley\nlike a waterfall. In the meadows and on the sloping fields the sunbeams\nquivered in the dew. They sifted in gold, they glittered in green, they\nsilvered the clear brooks that babbled down the hills. From every bush\ncame a twittering and chirping and clapping of wings. From everything,\neverywhere, came a message of joy and activity and sprouting life.\nMingled in one great morning effervescence, single sights and sounds\nwere lost; only the call of the cuckoo, far up on the birch-clad slope,\nwas heard above the other sounds, and from every shining window glanced\na big, serene eye of reflected sun rays.\n\nAnd just as there were thousands of different sounds, so were there\nalso thousands of different odors,--from the steaming earth, from the\ngrowing grass, from buds and blossoms; and above them all, like the\ncuckoo's call that was heard above the thousands of blended sounds,\nrose the fine, penetrating fragrance of newly sprouted birch trees.\n\nLisbeth stood still awhile, drawing deep breaths and letting the sweet\nair and the effervescence of spring stream in upon her. Then she looked\naround at the different farm buildings. Quiet brooded within them and\nevery door was shut. Of all the living creatures belonging to the farm,\nnot one was to be seen except Bearhunter, who got up slowly from the\nflat stone where he had been lying, comfortably sunning himself, and\ncame over to her, looking up into her face and wagging his tail.\n\nTruly, she believed she was the first one up on the whole farm to-day.\n\nWell, of course she would have to wait. So she sat herself down on the\nsteps.\n\nOh, no; it was just as she might have known it would be. Kjersti Hoel\nwas up. Lisbeth heard her come out of her own room into the kitchen,\ntake a big stick, and knock three times on the ceiling to waken the\ngirls in the south chamber.\n\nIn a moment Lisbeth heard a thump! thump! as the girls hopped out of\nbed, and then a clattering noise as they put on their shoes. Soon\nKjersti came out of the house. She was going over to the building where\nthe men slept to waken them.\n\nCatching sight of Lisbeth, she exclaimed: \"No! this cannot be Lisbeth\nalready up. What a wide-awake little girl! I think I shall have to make\nyou head milkmaid.\"\n\nAt this Lisbeth became so shy that she could not raise her eyes to look\nat Kjersti; but it must be acknowledged that when the head milkmaid and\nthe other girls came downstairs a certain small nose was tilted a\nlittle higher than usual.\n\nSoon there was life and motion over the whole farm. The activity was\nvery different from that of ordinary days, for everything was done with\nextra haste, and all that was done seemed to have some connection with\nthe cow house. The doors at both ends of this building stood wide open,\nand every one seemed to have an errand which obliged him to pass\nthrough. The spring air streaming in made the cows turn around in their\nstalls, stretch their nostrils, and look out. When Kjersti herself\nappeared on the scene, after the girls had begun milking, and talked to\nthe cows and patted the neck of the bell cow, the creatures at once\nrealized what day it was. The bell cow threw up her head and bellowed\ntill the cow house echoed. That was a signal for all the other cows.\nThey pulled at their chains, swung their tails, and one after another,\nalong the whole row, joined in a manifold bellow of joyful expectancy\nthat shook the entire cow house and seemed as if it would never end.\nAbove the many-voiced chorus could be heard the bellowing of the big\nbull, deep and even and good-natured, as if he did not need to exert\nhimself in the least in order to be heard.\n\nAlthough everything went so much more speedily to-day than usual, the\ntime seemed long to Lisbeth Longfrock. When the farm people went into\nthe house to eat their early breakfast, she could not understand how\nthey could sit at the table so long. She finished her meal very quickly\nand asked if she might not go and let out the smaller animals,--the\nsheep and the goats,--so that that would be done. Yes, Kjersti said she\nmight. In a trice, therefore, she had them out, and as usual they\nscattered in every direction, leaping and capering,--all except\nCrookhorn, who seized her chance to slink into the cow house through\nthe open door; but Lisbeth was so busy that she did not notice this.\n\nAll at once there came an instant's stillness, as if everything\nlistened. Then from the farmhouse the tuneful clanging of a deep-toned\nbell was heard, and in a moment this was answered by such a joyful\nlowing and bellowing, such a sniffing and rattling of chains, that it\nseemed as if a thunderstorm were passing over the farm; for when the\nanimals recognized the sound of that deep-toned bell, which they had\nnot heard since they were shut up in the cow house the autumn before,\nthey knew that the time for being let out into the open air was close\nat hand.\n\nA formal procession now issued from the farmhouse. Kjersti marched at\nthe front, carrying the big iron-bound cow collar to which the\ndeep-toned bell was fastened; next came the head milkmaid, followed by\nthe under-milkmaid; then the girls who worked in the farmhouse; and\nthen the two farm hands, with thick sticks, which they afterwards dealt\nout to the company, giving one to Lisbeth as well as to the rest. Last\nof all came Bearhunter, who also wanted to have a part in what was\ngoing on.\n\nWhen the procession reached the cow house there was again a sudden\nsilence. The cows, one and all, turned their heads toward the people as\nthey came in, and looked at them with large, expectant eyes.\n\nThe procession then divided into groups, and definite work was assigned\nto each person. The head milkmaid was to unfasten the cows; Lisbeth and\nthe under-milkmaid and the housemaids, each with her stout stick, were\nto steer the cows out through the door; the farm hands were to stand in\nthe cow lane to meet the creatures and guide them into the right road\n(they were to be pastured up in the north meadow) and to separate those\nwho fought with each other; and Kjersti and Bearhunter were to watch\neverything from the gateway.\n\nAll was ready. The moment for the start had come.\n\nKjersti went into the stall of the cow who was to wear the bell. The\ncow straightened herself up, lifted her head as high as she could, and\nthen stood stock-still. She knew very well that she was the principal\ncow of the herd, and that the first place when they went out and in\nthrough the cow-house door belonged to her; but she knew also that even\nshe had to be on her best behavior when Kjersti, the mistress of the\nwhole farm, did her the honor of clasping around her neck the cow\ncollar with its bell,--emblem of dignity and power,--and of unfastening\nthe chain that held her in the stall. Kjersti clasped on the bell and\nunloosed the chain, which fell rattling to the floor; and then the bell\ncow swung slowly and deliberately out of the stall, like a big, heavy\nship out of its dock, and wended her way with solemn dignity toward the\ndoor. She carried her head so high and so stiffly that you could not\nsee the least swaying of her horns, and her bell gave only a single\ndecided stroke at each step.\n\nThe next to be let out was the big bull. The head milkmaid unloosed\nhim, and he sailed out just as stiffly and heavily as the bell cow had\ndone, with horns so high that they nearly touched the cow-house roof,\nand so wide apart that they seemed to stretch across the whole\npassageway. Lisbeth had never realized before how large the bull was.\n\nAnd then, one by one, in regular turn, the rest of the cows marched\nout. They were Brindle, Morlik (which means \"like its mother\"), Goldie,\nSpeckle, Blackie, Pusher, Summer-Leaf, Darkey, Wee Bonny, Trot-About,\nWreathie, and Moolley.[7] Wreathie was so named because the white marks\non her hide looked something like a wreath.\n\n      [7] Mulley (cow without horns).\n\nBeyond the cow stalls, now empty, were the stalls of the heifers, whose\nnames no one quite remembered as yet, and of the half-grown bulls, who\ndid not have any names at all.\n\nWhen it came to the unloosing of the heifers and young bulls, the scene\ngrew livelier and livelier. They stretched their necks and rubbed\nagainst their chains. They fell on their knees as soon as the unlooped\nchains slipped from their necks, and as they sprang up again you could\nhear their legs creak,--so stiff were they from standing in the stall\nall winter. They ran plump against the side wall or up into the wrong\npassageway. They dashed noisily against the door, two reaching it at\nthe same time and trying to rush through together but getting wedged by\ntheir fat sides; while those who had been set free after them came\nclose on their heels, pushing, clashing their horns, butting and\nbellowing,--until suddenly, the blockade being broken, out rushed the\nwhole throng.\n\nDirectly in the wake of the heifers and young bulls, to Lisbeth's\nextreme surprise, followed Crookhorn, who, kicking up her heels, made a\nswift dash out through the doorway.\n\nOutside the cow house, too, all was life and stir. As the animals came\ninto the lane, they lifted their heads, sniffed the air from the\nmountain side, and became eager and excited. Stiff-legged old cows, as\nwell as young calves, kicked up their hind legs and made frolicsome\nleaps this way and that. They rushed playfully or angrily at each\nother, clashing their horns, and giving a short bellow if worsted in\nthe tussle; then they dashed off to assail other members of the crowd.\nEverything combined to form a hubbub of lowing and bellowing, horn\nclashing and fence creaking, whacking of sticks and shouting of people;\nwhile back and forth through all the confusion, with his horns high\nabove all the other horns, went the big bull, like a great heavy\nsnowplow, clearing the way. Of the whole herd, only one cow stood\nundisturbed amid the wild uproar, calmly waiting and looking about.\nThat was the bell cow, whom, of course, none of the other cows dared to\ndisturb.\n\nAt last the head milkmaid came to the front and gave a call. The bell\ncow threw up her head and with a loud, echoing bellow started to follow\nher. Next came Brindle, still sniffing with anger after her many\nencounters. She had got the best of all who were worth getting the best\nof, and if she could not be the bell cow, she would, at any rate, stand\nnext to her.\n\nDirectly after Brindle came Crookhorn, with a self-important air and\nmaking herself as tall as possible. But Brindle was in no mood for\nseeing the funny side of things to-day, so she lunged out with one of\nher long hind legs and gave Crookhorn a blow on the head that made the\nprideful goat see stars. But Crookhorn merely tossed her head and went\non as if nothing had happened. Such actions, she thought, were probably\ncustomary among cows.\n\nThe head milkmaid kept on calling, and the cows, one after another,\nhearing her voice, started toward her. Soon the whole noisy herd, led\nby the deep-toned bell and urged by shouts and flourishing of sticks,\nwas going in full swing toward the north meadow.\n\nUp in the meadow, which they reached after a while, the ground was\nlevel and there was plenty of room, so that the danger of collisions\nand other accidents was lessened. The young creatures danced around in\nwild play, and those of the cows who had not settled the question of\nmastery fought now a battle that was to be decisive for the whole\nsummer. Soon, however, everything became quiet again, and in a couple\nof hours all of the animals, even the worst combatants, were grazing\nplacidly side by side.\n\nAfter this the farm people began to go home,--all except the head\nmilkmaid and Lisbeth, who were to remain a while longer so as to be on\nhand in case anything happened. And something did happen. Brindle,\nwhose quiet behavior had been only temporary, soon began to rove\nuneasily back and forth, sniffing hard. _She_ was really the one who\nought to be wearing the bell, she sniffed to herself; and then\nsuddenly, with a violent rush, she hurled herself at the bell cow. Such\na fight as there was then! The turf flew in all directions. Soon a\nsharp crack was heard, and a short, wild bellow, and one of Brindle's\nhorns hung dangling.\n\nBrindle shook her head till the blood splashed; then, giving another\nbellow, she turned and ran the shortest way home as fast as her legs\ncould carry her, never stopping until she had reached the cow-house\ndoor. There she gave vent to a terrible bellowing, as if she wanted to\nbring all the farm buildings down over the people's ears.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nAfter dinner the calves were let out. Lisbeth had finally named the\nthree cow calves Yellow Speckle, Redsides, and Young Moolley, but as\nyet she had found no name to suit her for the bull calf. Lisbeth saw\nplainly that Kjersti wondered why she had not called any of the calves\nafter Bliros (Gentle Cow), but she gave no sign of having noticed\nKjersti's thought.\n\nThis is the way the calves were induced to leave their pen and to cross\nthe cow-house floor. To begin with, a good-sized pail with a little\nmilk in it was held out to each calf. In their eagerness to get the\nmilk the calves thrust their heads clear into the pails; and when the\npersons holding these began to run, the calves ran too, with the pails\nover their heads like hats. Outside the cow-house door the pails were\nsnatched off and there stood the calves, who had never before been\nbeyond their pen, in the very midst of the great, wonderful new world.\n\nThe startled creatures gave an amazed look and then began to back, just\nas if they felt themselves suddenly standing at the head of a steep\nstairway; but soon they ventured to put one foot carefully forward,\nthen another, and another. It was slow work, one step at a time; but at\nlength they found that there was firm ground in this new region. They\nconcluded that the world was only a larger calf pen, after all; but it\nwas a wonderfully light calf pen, and its walls were certainly a long\nway off. Swish! up went their tails into the air and away they\nscampered like the wildest of forest animals.\n\nThen began a great race in the big field,--from fence to fence, this\nway and that, crosswise, and round and round. Every time the calves\njumped over a hillock Kjersti and Lisbeth saw their tails stand\nstraight up against the sky like tillers. Lisbeth thought she had never\nseen anything so funny. But they could not keep together long. They\nsoon ran off in various directions, and in the evening Lisbeth had to\ngo to the farthest corners of the field with a pail and coax them home\none by one; for of course they did not have sense enough to know when\nto go home,--they who were out in the world for the first time!\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nLisbeth was lying again in her little room. It was the evening of her\nfirst working day. She had said her simple evening prayer, as usual,\nand then stretched herself out on the bed, feeling how good it was to\nrest, for her body was tired through and through.\n\nWhat a day it had been! A long day, too, she knew; nevertheless, she\ncould not imagine where it had gone. She felt that she must think over\nall that had happened. But drowsiness came stealing upon her and threw\nthe scenes of the day into confusion. She saw a pair of big horns that\nplowed like a snow plow through a swarming crowd, and then she saw\nBrindle standing in her stall with her head on one side and a big\nbandage over one of her horns, looking exactly like an old peasant\nwoman with a kerchief tied around her head for a headache; and then she\nthought she saw, written in the air, a couplet that she had once heard:\n\n    Rearing its tail against the sky,\n    Danced the calf on the hilltop high.\n\nAnd then Lisbeth Longfrock fell asleep.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nThe next day, with the lunch bag upon her back, Lisbeth Longfrock set\nout for a forest that lay not far off, taking the sheep and goats with\nher. She had not succeeded in getting Crookhorn to go along, however.\nThe self-willed goat had taken the shortest cut up to the north meadow,\nwhere the cows were again pastured.\n\nLisbeth's second working day, like her first, seemed a very long one,\nfor the forest was wonderfully lonesome and still. The little girl had\ntime to think of many, many things,--of her mother and Jacob and\nPeerout Castle; and it must be acknowledged that she cried a wee bit,\ntoo.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nSUMMER: TAKING THE ANIMALS UP TO THE S\u00c3\u0086TER\n\n\nUpward over the open slope across the valley from Hoel Farm a lengthy\nprocession was taking its way.\n\nKjersti Hoel stood at the window of her room, following the procession\nwith her eyes as long as she could, for soon it would vanish from the\nopen slope into the wooded part of the mountain. The herds belonging to\nHoel Farm were that day being taken up to the s\u00c3\u00a6ter,[8] to spend the\nsummer grazing on the rich grass which grows in sunny spaces here and\nthere on the mountain heights.\n\n      [8] Pronounced (approximately) say'ter.\n\nAt the head of the procession rode the milkmaid on the military\nhorse,[9] which for this occasion had a woman's saddle upon its back.\nThe saddle had a high frame, so that it looked almost like an\neasy-chair; and the milkmaid sitting aloft on it, dressed in her best,\nand with a white linen kerchief on her head, was rosy, plump, and also\nsomewhat self-conscious, for was not she the most important person in\nthe company, the one who was to give all the commands?\n\n      [9] In some districts of Norway the farmers are required to keep\n      one or more horses subject to the needs of the government, under\n      certain conditions of use and payment.\n\nAfter her came two farm hands, each leading a horse whose back fairly\ncurved in under its heavy load. Then followed the herds in order of\nrank. First came the bell cow, then Brindle with her wounded horn that\nhad grown on awry, then Crookhorn, then Darkey, and behind Darkey the\nwhole long train of cows,--all except two, old Moolley and the pet, Wee\nBonny, who were to stay at home to furnish milk for the people there\nand to teach the new calves to follow. After the cows stalked the big\nbull, as if acting as rear guard for his herd.\n\nNext came the goats, hurrying along and trying to get ahead; then the\nsheep in a tight clump; and behind these, four great pigs and a few\ncalves; while at the very end of the train came the under-milkmaid, and\nLisbeth Longfrock with her lunch bag on her back.\n\nIn the beginning all had gone as gayly as a dance, for almost every one\nhad pleasant memories of the summer before, and it seemed impossible to\nreach the mountain top quickly enough; but as they mounted, the way\nbecame steeper and steeper, and the sun rose higher and higher, burning\ntheir backs. The pigs began to lag behind, trying to branch off at\nevery side path so as to get a little nap in the shade or cool\nthemselves in a mudhole. The sheep and goats, feeling the need of\nsomething in their stomachs, slipped aside whenever they spied a young\nbirch tree whose leaves they could nibble, or a fence to peep through,\nor a plot of green grass. The last year's calves, who had not been to\nthe s\u00c3\u00a6ter before, saw no reason at all for hurrying, and made no\nattempt at it except when the stick was used upon them.\n\nSo Lisbeth Longfrock had to keep rushing off the road into side paths,\nbehind bushes, into forest thickets and boggy marshes, to drag the\nvarious creatures back into line; and scarcely did she get them safely\ninto the road from one side before they slipped out again on the other.\n\nShe had to take off one of her long knitted garters and tie it around\nher waist so that she could tuck her long frock up out of the way; for\nshe was constantly on the run, coaxing, shouting, and circumventing.\n\nIt was a hard struggle. Her light hair became dripping wet and her face\nwas as red as a half-ripe mountain cranberry; but Lisbeth did not\nnotice her discomfort, so absorbed was she in what she had to do. The\nunder-milkmaid would return to the farm with the men when the s\u00c3\u00a6ter was\nreached. It was Lisbeth who was to have the responsibility for the\nsmaller animals during the whole summer, and who was to bring them home\nin the autumn fat and glossy. She and the head milkmaid had their\nspecial responsibilities, each at her own end of the line, as it were;\nand even if Lisbeth's was only the tail end, she did not wish to have\nthe disgrace of being unable to keep it in order.\n\nThe procession continued mounting higher and higher, and soon the whole\nvalley lay below, deep and wide and delicately green. The fir trees\nbecame smaller and more scattered, the slender birches grew closer\ntogether. Before long the first specimens of black crowberries and \"old\nwoman's switches\" (dwarf birch trees) were seen; and with that the\nprocession was up over the crest of the mountain side.\n\n[Illustration: THE VALLEY AND THE FARMS]\n\nThen, all at once, it seemed as if a heavy weight slipped off; as if\nall weariness was smoothed away from man and beast. The whole mountain\nsent its freshness and peace streaming over them. They were in a new\nworld. Before them, with its boundless surface broken into level spaces\nand undulating slopes, lay the mountain top, stretching itself far, far\naway, until lost in the deepening blue of a snow-streaked summit. If\nthey looked back, the valley seemed to have sunk out of sight; but on\nthe mountain top across the valley they could see wide expanses of open\nland dotted with shining water and grassy s\u00c3\u00a6ter districts.\n\nDrawing a long breath, all gazed silently around. What a tranquillity\nlay over everything! Of their own accord the animals fell into order\nalong the stony road curving endlessly beyond them. They made no more\nattempts to branch off into side paths, but walked slowly along at an\neven pace. That gave Lisbeth a little time to view her surroundings.\nShe had never seen a place so broad and open. And up here she was to\nspend the whole bright summer.\n\nAll at once, in the midst of this vastness and space, Lisbeth felt\nherself so wonderfully little! But she was not at all terrified; she\nonly felt very solemn and peaceful.\n\nShe began to think of the future,--of the rest of the day, the coming\nsummer, and the many summers that would follow. Sometime she herself\nwould be big and grown up, like the head milkmaid, whom she could now\nsee sitting on the high saddle far ahead. Sometime she herself would\nsit up there, perhaps, and ride at the front.\n\nThe pack horses refused to go slowly now, even under their heavy loads.\nThey forged ahead, passed the mounted milkmaid, and soon disappeared\nover a distant ridge. The procession followed slowly. Hour after hour\nit wound its curving way over ridges and brooks, past s\u00c3\u00a6ters and\nshining mountain lakes. Lisbeth had the honor of sitting up in the\nsaddle and riding awhile, the milkmaid feeling that she would gladly\nwalk a little.\n\nEvening began to draw nigh. They took their way high up through a gap\nin the mountain which they had seen in the distance early in the\nmorning. After that the road began to descend. They met with birch\ntrees again and one single warped fir tree; and from below they heard\nthe rushing sound of a large river.\n\nThey reached at last the edge of the s\u00c3\u00a6ter valley to which they were\nbound, and stood still to look down. Below them lay a comparatively\nlevel space, peaceful and green, with its three s\u00c3\u00a6ter huts, belonging\nto Hoegseth,[10] Lunde,[11] and Hoel farms. From the chimneys of two\nof the huts smoke was ascending in the still afternoon air.\n\n      [10] Pronounce the _oe_ like the _e_ in _her_ and _th_ like\n      _t_.\n\n      [11] Loond'eh (_oo_ as in _good_).\n\nThe gazers were filled with delight. This, then, was the spot where\nthey were to spend the summer! The cows began to bellow. The smaller\nanimals, one and all, started on a run past the cows and down the hill.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nEarly the next morning Lisbeth was on her way across the mountain\npasture with the small animals in her charge. She did not have the\nlunch bag on her back now, for while she was up at the s\u00c3\u00a6ter she was to\ntake dinner at the hut every noon.\n\nThe sunshine was brilliant. The cows had been turned loose and were\nwalking away on the nearest cow path, going in single file as if strung\non a line. The leader's bell rang deeply and regularly, its tone\nmingling with others quite as deep from the neighboring s\u00c3\u00a6ters; and in\nupon this solemn ringing broke the delicate, brisk dingle-dangle of the\nsmaller creatures' bells.\n\nThe time had now come when Lisbeth Longfrock was to make her first\nentrance into the vast unknown. The milkmaid had told her that while\ntending her animals this first day she should not wander too far, lest\nshe might not be able to find her way back. She was to listen to the\nother herders and keep near them. The milkmaid did not know whether the\nother herders were boys or girls this year.\n\nLisbeth kept looking back every now and then to keep track of the way\nshe had come, and was apparently loath to lose sight of the hut; but\nthe animals drifted rapidly off in the distance and she had to follow\nso as not to lose sight of them altogether, and after a while, when she\nlooked back, the hut could not be seen. Around her were only the\nunending wastes of hill and marsh and the faraway mountain peaks. How\nspacious and silent it was! Not a sound was to be heard except that of\nthe bells; not even the river's rushing harmonies reached up to where\nshe stood.\n\nShe suddenly felt herself so utterly alone and remote and had such a\nlonging to caress some living creature that she went among the flock\nand petted now this one and now that. The bell goat became so envious\nthat it butted the others out of the way and stood rubbing itself\nagainst her.\n\nAll at once there came a call, \"Ho-i-ho! ho-i-ho!\" so loud and clear\nthat the mountains echoed with it. The goats pricked up their ears, and\nLisbeth, too, listened breathlessly. The call was so unexpected that\nshe had not distinguished from what quarter it came. It sounded near,\nand yet, because of the echoes, from all directions.\n\n\"Ho-i-ho! ho-i-ho!\" This time the call was still louder. Presently she\nheard bells, several bells, and then she saw a large flock of sheep and\ngoats come straggling over the crest of a hill.\n\nVery likely it was the other herders who were calling. Lisbeth saw two\nstraw hats rise above the hill, and by degrees two tall boys seemed to\ngrow up out of the hilltop,--boys about as big as Jacob.\n\nAt sight of them Lisbeth felt so shy that she kneeled down and hid\nherself behind a bushy little mound.\n\nThe boys shaded their eyes with their hands and looked down from the\nhilltop.\n\n\"Ho-i-ho!\" they called, and then listened. \"Ho-i-ho!\"\n\nNo answer. All was still.\n\nThen one of the boys cried out:\n\n    Oh, ho! you boy from Hoel, don't you hear?\n    If you have pluck, we call you to appear!\n\nThey stood awhile, watching. Then they darted forward, turned two or\nthree somersaults, and ran down the hill toward her, repeating their\ncall and shouting. Again they stopped and listened, as if uncertain.\n\n\"Ho-i-ho!\" Again they challenged:\n\n    If you lie hid behind some bush or stone,\n    Come out and show there's marrow in your bone!\n\nThen the two boys came to the bottom of the hill, where Lisbeth's flock\nwas, and looked around. No, they did not see any one. The new herder\nfrom Hoel, who dared to lose track of his flock the first day, must be\na reckless young scamp--a fellow it might be fun to get acquainted\nwith. Very likely he had heard of their bathing place in the Sloping\nMarsh. Probably that was where he had gone now.\n\nWell, they would take his animals with them and go there themselves;\nbut first they would give another call. Perhaps he was not so far away\nbut that he might hear if they gave a good loud one.\n\n\"Ho-i-ho!\" From far away echo repeated the sounds in \"dwarf language,\"\nas the Norwegian boys call it.\n\nWhen all was still again, there sounded close at hand, as thin and\nclear as the peep of a bird, \"Ho-i-ho!\"\n\nThis was from Lisbeth, who, when she heard that they were going to take\nher flock away, felt that she ought to call out, although it was\nextremely embarrassing.\n\nThe boys stopped short, greatly astonished. From behind the bushy\nlittle mound there arose something small, just like a tiny \"hill\nwoman,\" in a plaid neckerchief and a long frock, who stood stock-still\nand looked at them with large, shy eyes.\n\nAt sight of her the boys were somewhat abashed. It was a little\nembarrassing for them to find that their boastful, taunting rhymes had\nbeen directed against a poor timorous \"young one,\" and a girl at that;\nbut it was exasperating, too, for they had expected to see a comrade of\ntheir own size.\n\nHumph! any one could see that Hoel Farm had women folk at the head of\nit. The mistress was not willing that even the herder should be a boy.\n\nIf the \"young one\" had only been bigger,--bigger than themselves,--they\ncould have shown their contempt for her and chased her; but that little\nmidget! no, indeed, grown-up fellows like them did not waste either\nwords or blows on such small fry! It would be a good plan, however, to\ntalk with her a bit and hear whether another herder was not coming to\ntake her place. After that they would have nothing more to do with her.\nThey could get along by themselves for one summer. All that was\nnecessary was to frighten her a little, so that she would keep out of\ntheir way.\n\nThey came over to Lisbeth and stood before her, big-boy-like, with\ntheir hands in their pockets. Then one of them said, \"Are you going to\nbe the Hoel herder this summer?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Lisbeth. Then, as if to excuse herself, she added\nquickly, \"Kjersti wanted me to.\"\n\n\"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Lisbeth; and Jacob calls me Longfrock.\"\n\n\"Where are you from?\"\n\n\"From Peerout.\"\n\n\"Are you Jacob Peerout's sister? We went to school with him last\nwinter.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am.\"\n\n\"What a nuisance that Jacob himself did not come! We haven't any use at\nall for young ones like you up here.\"\n\nThe speaker, who was the larger of the two boys, stood awhile waiting\nfor a reply; but Lisbeth did not know what answer to make to his remark\nand therefore said nothing. So he continued: \"Well, we only wanted to\nsay to you--I'm Ole Hoegseth and that fellow over there is Peter\nLunde--that you must keep out of our way. You must not dare to come a\nstep beyond a line running from Pancake Stone down around the Sloping\nMarsh to the Pointing Stump near the Hoegseth cow path. If you let\nyour animals graze beyond that line, your brother Jacob, next winter,\nshall get all the thrashings you ought to have this summer.\"\n\nLisbeth was dreadfully frightened and her mouth began to tremble. Then\nthe second boy said to the larger one, \"Yes, but Jacob is so strong\nthat he will get the best of you.\"\n\n\"Not when I have brought myself into good training. Hoi!\" and he turned\na handspring.\n\n\"Now you know what Jacob may expect, so take care what you do! We boys\nare going up to the Sloping Marsh to bathe. Ho-i-ho!\"\n\nWith shout and call they took their way up over the hill again. At the\ntop they looked back and then glanced a little dubiously at each other.\nLisbeth Longfrock was still standing where they had left her, and--she\nwas crying!\n\nLisbeth felt very small and forlorn as she stood there. She certainly\ndid not want to do anything that Jacob would get a thrashing for. If\nshe only knew where it was that she was not allowed to go! but she had\nnot the least idea where either the Pointing Stump or the Sloping Marsh\nlay. All that she could do would be to keep with her animals and find\nout about these places later.\n\nSometime afterwards, when Lisbeth had mounted a small round hill, she\nheard the bells of the boys' flocks again. That gave her a fright, and\nshe began to chase her animals off in another direction. But as she\nturned around to do so she saw, far, far down the marsh, two white\nfigures running, jumping, and playing leapfrog in the sunshine beside a\ngleaming pond. The boys had let their flocks stray away from them!\n\nLisbeth dreaded incurring more displeasure, but surely something ought\nto be done. There was no help for it; she would really have to take\ncare of the stray animals for a while. The boys could not be angry at\nthat, she knew, because the greatest disgrace that can befall a herder\nis the losing of his flock, and for boys so big as these to go back to\nthe s\u00c3\u00a6ter without any animals would be especially humiliating.\n\nSo Lisbeth went to work gathering the flocks together, jumping up on a\nmound every now and then to see if the boys were not ready to come; but\nthey appeared to have forgotten everything except their play.\n\nAt length she saw that the boys suddenly stood still and listened,\npeering about in all directions. Then they started into activity again,\nsnatched up their clothes, put them on in great haste, and started off\non a run toward the opposite edge of the marsh. Every little while they\nwould stop and listen, and then run on again. They were so far off that\nthere was no use in Lisbeth's shouting to them or trying to give the\ncall \"Ho-i-ho!\"\n\nWhen the boys reached a round hill that lay on the other side of the\nmarsh, they ran to the top and again peered in all directions for a\nlong time. Then, as fast as their legs could carry them, they made\ntheir way back across the marsh straight toward the small round hill\nwhere Lisbeth was. As they neared it Lisbeth thought that now was the\ntime to give the herder's call, for the flocks were on the other side\nof the hill and their bells could not be heard by the boys. Her first\ncall was too weak. She gave another somewhat stronger.\n\nThe boys stopped and answered.\n\nLisbeth called again, \"Ho-i-ho!\" and then the boys came up the hill.\nThey found it a little difficult to break the silence. It was rather\nannoying to be obliged to question that \"young one\" about their flocks;\nbut there was no other way.\n\n\"Have you seen our animals?\"\n\nLisbeth looked at them pleadingly. \"They are here at the foot of the\nhill. I have been taking care of them, but you must not thrash Jacob\nfor it.\"\n\nThe boys looked as they felt,--rather crestfallen. But they had to say\nsomething, so Ole remarked, as they turned and left her, \"Oh, well, we\n'll let him off for this one time.\"\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nWhen Lisbeth went to fasten the gate of the fold that evening Peter\nLunde came bobbing along outside the fence.\n\n\"You haven't a strange sheep here, have you?\"\n\n\"No; I have counted mine.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps I counted mine wrong. Very likely they are all there.\"\n\nThe two stood looking at each other for a while; then both grew shy and\nhad to turn their eyes away. At last Peter said: \"Lisbeth, if you want\nto, you may tend your flock wherever we tend ours, and you may come to\nour pond. I understood Ole to say that he is willing, too; but if he\nmakes any fuss about it, why I _can_ thrash him if I really want to.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will come gladly, you may be sure.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I will come after you to-morrow morning, back of the hill\nhere.\"\n\nLisbeth did not get a chance to say anything more, for Peter was off\nlike a flash around the corner. He had seen Ole coming.\n\nOle came lounging along in his usual fashion, with his hands in his\npockets.\n\n\"You haven't seen a strange sheep, have you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Humph!\"\n\n\"Is one of yours missing?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know exactly. Humph! I thought I would tell you that you\nneed not bother yourself about what I said to-day. I did not mean\nanything by it. It was Peter that made me say it; and if you want me\nto, I can thrash him for it to-morrow.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE TAMING OF CROOKHORN\n\n\nIt was early morning in the latter part of the summer, and the sun was\nshining brightly over Hoel S\u00c3\u00a6ter.\n\nLisbeth was alone inside the fold, milking goats. All was quiet and\npeaceful. Not a bell was heard. The only sounds were the gentle rush of\nthe river far below and an occasional soft thud from the cow house when\na cow bumped her horns against the wall in getting up. The milkmaid was\ninside the cow house, milking the cows. Lisbeth's hands were still too\nsmall for that work, so it had been arranged that she should have\nentire charge of the goats instead of helping with the larger animals.\n\nSuddenly from the hill above the s\u00c3\u00a6ter rang out \"Ho-o-i-ho!\" and in a\nfew minutes the call was answered a little farther off with a touch of\nirritation in the tone, \"Ho-o-i-ho!\"\n\n[Illustration: UP AT THE S\u00c3\u0086TER]\n\nLisbeth looked up and listened. Then with a smile of happy satisfaction\nshe went over to the fence and called, \"Ho-o-i-ho!\" Now she could send\nout the tones with vigor, so that they rang back from all the hills\naround; her voice no longer trembled when she answered the big boys'\ncall.\n\nTo-day she knew that they were calling especially to summon her, and\nthat they dared to come close to the s\u00c3\u00a6ter with their animals because\nthey had an errand,--something that they had planned with the milkmaid\nand Lisbeth.\n\nBy the sound of the bells she could tell that the boys were driving the\nanimals as fast as they could. The boy that was behind--Peter, of\ncourse--was provoked at not being first.\n\nBut, if you please, they would have to wait until she had finished her\nwork. They were out extremely early to-day!\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nHowever strange it may seem, Lisbeth Longfrock, soon after her arrival\nat Hoel S\u00c3\u00a6ter, had become a prime favorite with the other herders. The\nday after her first painful experiences the boys, as proposed, had met\nher behind the hill, Peter first and then Ole. No reference was made to\nthe previous day; it was merely taken for granted that in future she\nwould be with them. Ole said that she could look after their animals,\ntogether with her own, while they went off to bathe. Peter thought she\ncould, too. So she agreed to the arrangement.\n\nBut the boys did not play very long on the bank of the pond that day\nwhen they had finished bathing. It was not much fun, after all, to be\ndown there by themselves.\n\nSo it had come to pass that Lisbeth and her animals never came\nstrolling over the hill in the morning without meeting the boys. They\ngenerally came at nearly the same time, each from the direction of his\nown s\u00c3\u00a6ter, apparently trying to see who could be the first to give the\ncall. But when they met each did his best to make out to the other that\nhe had come there by the merest chance, both sheepishly realizing that\nthe very evening before they had put on big-boy airs about \"that young\none whom they could never get rid of,\" and had said that they would go\noff in an entirely different direction the next day, to avoid her if\npossible.\n\nOften the boys would have athletic contests, turning handsprings and\nwrestling from one meal-time to another because neither boy was willing\nto give up beaten. More than once in a single morning or afternoon\nwould Lisbeth have to remind them to look after their animals, because,\ncompletely forgotten by the boys, the flocks had strayed nearly out of\nsight.\n\nOccasionally it happened that one boy would reach Hoel S\u00c3\u00a6ter ten or\nfifteen minutes before the other and would find Lisbeth ready to set\nout. In that case the first comer would insist that he and Lisbeth\nshould start out by themselves, urging that the other boy had probably\ngone somewhere else that day. Such times were almost the pleasantest,\nLisbeth thought, for then the one boy had always so much to show her\nthat the other boy did not know about,--a marshy ledge, white as snow\nwith cloudberry blossoms, where there would be many, many berries in\nthe autumn (that ledge they could keep for themselves,--it was not\nworth while to let the other boy know about everything they found); or\na ptarmigan nest with thirteen big eggs in it; or a ridge where\nscouring rushes[12] grew unusually long and thick.\n\n      [12] A species of horsetail rush (_Equisetum hyemale_), having a\n      rough, flinty surface. It is used for scouring and polishing.\n\nEach boy talked more with her, too, when by himself, and was less\nboastful and rough. And the one boy would climb trees and get spruce\ngum for her, while she would seek scouring rush for him. Scouring rush\nis something that requires a special knack in the one who is to\ndiscover it, and the boys had never seen Lisbeth's equal in spying it\nout. Peter said that if there was a single spear growing anywhere, you\nmight be sure that she would find it; to which Ole jokingly responded\nthat, for his part, he believed she could find one even where there\nwasn't any!\n\nAnd how many, many things both boys thought of that they could make!\nOne day when it rained Ole made Lisbeth a hat out of birch bark, and\nthe next day Peter came with a pair of birch-bark shoes for her. The\nmilkmaid must have laughed when she saw Lisbeth coming home that second\nday wearing the birch-bark hat and shoes, and carrying her ordinary\nshoes in her hand. Another day Ole gave her a pocketknife. She ought to\nhave something to whittle with, he thought, and he did not need that\nknife because he had one with a sheath that he always wore in his belt.\nThe next day Peter brought her a musical horn that he had made in the\nevenings from a goat's horn. It had an unusually fine tone. You could\nmanage to play that funny tune, \"Old Woman with a Stick,\" on it after a\nfashion.\n\nOle speculated a while as to what he could do to beat that, and then he\nhit upon an idea,--he would tame Crookhorn!\n\nThey had often seen Crookhorn going with the cows as if she were one of\nthem; and they knew that though she was Lisbeth's own goat there was no\nuse in trying to make her go with the other goats. The little girl had\ntold them how impossible it had been to manage the creature at the\nfarm, and that Kjersti had said the men would have to make an end of\nher when winter came.\n\nSo Ole offered to tame Crookhorn. He was sure that he could teach her\nto go with the others. There had never been a goat yet that had not\nbeen forced to yield when he attempted to master it.\n\nYes, indeed, Lisbeth was more than willing for him to try. If he\nsucceeded, she would gladly give him all she owned.\n\nNo, Ole did not want any payment for doing it; but if she insisted on\ngiving him something, he would like the goat's horns after the goat was\nslaughtered, as it would have to be some day. They would make matchless\nhorns to blow upon.\n\nBut Peter, too, wanted to have a share in the undertaking. If the goat\nproved to be very cross and obstinate, two persons would surely be\nneeded to tame her. Then they could have one horn apiece.\n\nOle did not know whether he would agree to that or not, for it was he\nwho had thought of the plan.\n\nYes, but how could he carry it out? Peter did not believe that\nCrookhorn could be made to go with the other goats unless there was a\nstronger goat for her to be fastened to. Ole did not have such a one.\nIt was Peter who had the big billy goat, the only one strong enough for\nthe task.\n\nYes, that was true; so Peter might help in taming Crookhorn if he would\nlend his billy goat.\n\nLisbeth, for her part, thought they ought all to help; that was the\nonly proper way. And her suggestion was finally followed.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nOle's taming of Crookhorn was the errand that brought the boys to the\nHoel S\u00c3\u00a6ter on the morning that Lisbeth and the milkmaid were doing\ntheir milking so early.\n\nThe two flocks came pushing and crowding over the hill; but as soon as\nthe animals realized that they were to be allowed to go close to the\ns\u00c3\u00a6ter, they began to run at full speed. It was always such fun to go to\na strange place! They would be sure to find something new to see and to\nstick their noses into,--perhaps a little milk stirabout in the pig\ntrough, a little salt on the salting stone, or a hole in the fence\nwhere one could get a chance to squeeze through without being seen.\n\nThe bells clanged, the boys ran about shouting and hallooing and giving\ntheir musical calls, trying to keep the worst goats in order, but\nperhaps making a little more noise than was necessary.\n\nWhere all had been so still before there was now the liveliest\ncommotion. The milkmaid could not resist going to the cow-house door to\nlook out; and Lisbeth would surely have forgotten to milk the last of\nher goats if it had not come over to her of its own accord and stood\ndirectly in her way as she was going out of the fold.\n\nWhen Ole saw the milkmaid at the cow-house door he called out, \"Shall\nyou not let out your cattle soon?\"\n\n\"Yes; I am just ready to,\" answered the milkmaid. \"Are you ready,\nLisbeth?\"\n\n\"I am milking my last goat.\"\n\nSoon everything was done, and the animals stood waiting to be let out.\n\nOle had with him a strong band woven of willow withes, with an\ningeniously fastened loop at each end. One loop was for Peter's billy\ngoat, the other for Crookhorn. Ole thought it was a very fine apparatus\nindeed.\n\n\"Where is Crookhorn?\"\n\n\"In the cow house.\"\n\n\"Then I had better go in and get her myself. Bring your goat, Peter,\nand hold him ready.\"\n\nPeter called his big billy goat. It knew its name and came at once.\n\n\"Let me see how strong you are,\" said Peter. He took hold of its horns,\nheld its head down, and pushed against it. The billy goat bunted, took\na fresh start, bunted again,--they often played in this way,--and sent\nPeter against the fence.\n\n\"There!\" exclaimed Peter, picking himself up; \"I rather think that\nbilly goat is strong enough to drag any goat along, no matter how big a\none.\" Peter fairly glowed with pride.\n\nOle, too, wanted to try the strength of the goat. Yes, it was an\namazingly strong goat.\n\nThen Ole went into the cow house, and in a few moments came back\nleading Crookhorn by the band of willow withes. The next step was to\nfasten the other loop around the billy goat's neck, and behold! there\nstood the two goats harnessed together. But neither of them seemed to\nnotice that anything had been done.\n\nLisbeth and the milkmaid and the boys waited a while expectantly; but\nthe billy goat rather enjoyed being looked at, and would not budge so\nlong as they and the flocks were near by. He merely stood still and\nwanted to be petted.\n\nSo Ole said: \"Let your animals out, Lisbeth, and start ours on the\npath, Peter. Then we shall see a double-team grazing contest.\"\n\nLisbeth opened the gate and her animals crowded out, taking their\ncustomary way up over the hill. Peter drove his own flock and Ole's\nafter them.\n\nSeeing this, the billy goat thought it was high time for him to be\njogging along, so he took a step forward; but something was the matter.\nHe looked back. Who was playing tricks and hindering him?\n\nHe saw Crookhorn with all four legs planted fast on the ground and her\nneck stretched out.\n\n\"Pooh! nothing but that,\" thought the billy goat, taking a couple of\nsteps forward. Crookhorn found herself obliged to follow, but she laid\nher head back and struggled. Then the billy goat gathered all his\nforce, set his horns high in the air, and tugged at the band. He would\nshow her that he was not to be kept back by any such foolery!\n\nCrookhorn again found herself obliged to follow, but she resisted and\nresisted with all her might. At length her fore legs doubled up under\nher and she sank upon her knees; but the billy goat went on as if\nnothing had happened, and Crookhorn had to follow on her knees across\nthe whole flat part of the s\u00c3\u00a6ter field.\n\nLisbeth and the boys shrieked with laughter, and even the milkmaid\nfound it impossible not to join in.\n\nWhen Crookhorn reached the beginning of the hill, where the ground was\nmore uneven, she thought it wiser to get up and trot along on her four\nfeet; but although she yielded thus far for the sake of her own\ncomfort, she still continued to struggle against being forced to go at\nall.\n\nThe animals took the customary path leading farther over the mountain.\nLittle by little Crookhorn seemed to conclude that she must submit to\nthe inevitable. During the first part of the morning she was sullen and\ncontrary, merely allowing herself to be dragged along; but as the day\nwore on and her stomach felt empty and slack, she grew more subdued and\nbegan to walk quietly forward, eating as she went like any other\ngoat,--only looking up once in a while when she heard the heavy cow\nbell in the distance.\n\nThe fun was gone when Crookhorn took to behaving well, so the boys\nbegan as usual to wrestle and turn somersaults; and this they kept up\nuntil it was nearly time to go home for their nooning. Then Ole said:\n\"Now let us slip her loose on trial. I think she must be cured by this\ntime.\"\n\nYes, the others agreed to that.\n\nSo they called to the billy goat coaxingly. He came jogging along with\nhis big horns straight up and Crookhorn trailing after him. Ole first\nset the billy goat free, and then, kneeling down before Crookhorn, he\ntook hold of her beard. Crookhorn pawed with her feet as goats do when\nthey want to get rid of this hold, but Ole would not let go. He wished\nto give her a few admonitions first.\n\nNow that she had found her master, he told her, she need no longer\nimagine that she was a cow. Hereafter she was to behave like other\ngoats or she would have him to deal with; and at this he gave her beard\na wag, as if to add force to his words. That hurt Crookhorn, and she\nmade a bound straight at him and sent him rolling backward. Then,\npassing directly over him, with the willow band trailing behind her,\nshe set out on a trot across the marsh in the direction from which the\nsound of the cow bell had come.\n\nOle scrambled up again, stamped the ground with rage, and started after\nher.\n\nLisbeth and Peter were already on the way. They shouted and screamed as\nthey ran, and threatened Crookhorn with all sorts of punishments if she\ndid not stop; but Crookhorn acted as if she did not understand. She\nran, and they after her. The boys became more and more angry. It had\nnever happened before that they had been unable to capture a goat; and\nbesides, each boy was eager to get ahead of the other. So they ran\nfaster and faster. Although Lisbeth Longfrock was light-footed,\nespecially with her birch-bark shoes[13] on, she lagged behind. It was\nlike wading in deep water to try to run in that long frock of hers,\nwhich, in the hasty start of the morning, she had forgotten to tuck up\nin her belt as usual.\n\n      [13] Lisbeth's ordinary shoes were clumsy wooden ones.\n\nSoon she caught a last glimpse of the boys as they disappeared over a\nhill on the other side of the marsh. Peter was ahead (she believed he\nreally was the faster runner of the two). But she herself was only in\nthe middle of the marsh.\n\nSo she stopped. Certainly the best thing that she could do was to go\nback and get the animals together; otherwise all three flocks were\nlikely to stray away.\n\nShe turned back, recrossed the marsh, and had climbed the hill a little\nway when she heard a rumbling and thudding noise, which grew constantly\nlouder and louder, while the ground seemed to roll in waves under her\nfeet. What could it be? Around the foot of the hill came a big herd of\nhorses[14]--oh, what a big herd! There were horses old and young, and\nfoals running beside their mothers; horses brown, dun-colored, black,\nand white; and all of them were so bright and shiny and fat and\nskittish! They trotted and ran, with heads tossing,--those ahead being\npassed by others, then those behind getting ahead again,--making a\nnoise almost like the booming of thunder.\n\n      [14] Horses, as well as other animals, are sent up on the\n      mountains to graze during the summer. They roam about at will,\n      and sometimes go home of their own accord at the end of the\n      season, if no one has been sent to fetch them.\n\nLisbeth stood still and watched them, half afraid. She had never seen\nso big a herd before. They noticed her, too, but they did not run at\nher at all. Only two or three stopped, pricked up their ears, and gazed\nat her, trying to make out what kind of little creature she could be.\nThen they ran on again, and in an instant the whole herd had gone past.\nLisbeth could only hear the thunder of their hoofs as they galloped\ninto the path leading to the s\u00c3\u00a6ter.\n\nBut her animals! and the boys' flocks! Naturally the horses had\nfrightened them. Lisbeth could see no trace of them anywhere. She ran\nfrom hill to hill, stopping to listen and then running again.\n\nIt was all of no use; she could not find them. The only wise course for\nher was to go back to the s\u00c3\u00a6ter.\n\nThis was the first and only time that Lisbeth Longfrock went home\nwithout taking her animals with her.\n\nBut when she reached the s\u00c3\u00a6ter there lay the whole flock peacefully\nwithin the fold, chewing the cud. They had gone home of their own\naccord. The horses that had given Lisbeth such a fright were there\nalso, walking about and licking up the salt which the milkmaid had\nstrewn for them.\n\nIn the afternoon the milkmaids from the other s\u00c3\u00a6ters came to inquire\nafter the boys, for their goats had also come home of themselves long\nbefore the usual time.\n\nIt was not until much later that Ole and Peter arrived, dragging\nCrookhorn between them.\n\nWhen the milkmaids laughed at them the boys could not help feeling a\nlittle chagrined. That they had let their flocks stray away could not\nbe denied; but no one could say that they had come home without any\nanimal at all,--although two big boys _did_ seem a rather liberal\nnumber to be in charge of a single goat, however large that goat might\nbe.\n\nThings had gone wrong for that day, Ole acknowledged; but Crookhorn was\nnot to think that she had seen the end of the struggle. They would take\nher with them again the next day. She should get her deserts.\n\nBut it turned out otherwise. Crookhorn knew better than to let such a\nthing happen. When they took off the willow band she stood still awhile\nwith her neck stretched up, looking at the horses which were at that\nmoment going out of the inclosure. Suddenly she kicked up her hind legs\nin real horse fashion, and then away she went after the herd as fast as\nshe could go.\n\nThe milkmaids, as well as the boys, could do nothing but stand and gape\nwhen they saw her join the horses.\n\n\"Probably she imagines now that she is a horse,\" thought they.\n\nFor a while they stood in silence watching the receding herd. Then Ole\nsaid in his dry fashion, \"If there had been any elephants here, it\nwould have been just like Crookhorn to imagine herself an elephant.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nHOME FROM THE S\u00c3\u0086TER\n\n\nSummer, with its light nights and brilliant days, comes rapidly to full\npower on the mountains in Norway. The season is brief but intense.\n\nIt begins with a creeping of light green over the gentle slopes and\nunending marshes, and a trickling of light green down around each\n_tue_, or little mound of earth covered with moss and tiny berry\nplants. Ptarmigans roam about in solitary pairs, murmuring when any one\ncomes too near their nests; gnats and horseflies buzz through the air;\nand cows, with tails set straight up, scamper friskily about, trying to\nescape the irritating stings.\n\nOver everything lies a thick, warm, dark-blue haze, hindering a free\noutlook.\n\nBut soon come the blueberries, the marsh wool or cotton grass, and\nlater the cloudberries; and on some fine day when the mother ptarmigans\ngo out to walk, peeping sounds are heard around them, here, there, and\neverywhere. The mother birds scold more than ever, now that their young\nones are whirling like so many feathery balls a yard or more upward,\nand two or three yards forward, and then tumbling down into the heather\nagain, head foremost. By this time the cows roam about quietly and\nmeditatively over the mountain, seeking the juiciest, best-flavored\nherbage to nibble; the warm haze melts away and the air becomes so\nsparklingly clear that mountain peaks miles distant are as delicately\nand sharply outlined as the nearest little mound. Then the cloudberry\nblossoms fall, and soon the marshes grow yellow and red, the tiny\nblossoms of the heather color all the knolls and rocky places, the\ngreenness vanishes, and over the patches of white reindeer moss, which\nshine out like snow here and there on the mountain, comes a blush of\nred and a tinge of brown. Autumn is now drawing near.\n\nMuch of the time the sun shines brightly, and when it does, how\nglorious to be the herder of a flock!\n\nBut there come days also when the fog spreads itself like a close gray\nblanket, under which the ground, with its mounds and bushes and\nheather, creeps stealthily, disappearing a few yards away. And out of\nthe fog comes a fine, mist-like rain, which deposits itself in tiny\ngray beads on every blade and every pine needle, so that wherever any\none goes there is a little sprinkling of water.\n\nIn such weather it is far from pleasant to be in charge of a flock. If\nthe animals move forward quietly, the herder must seek shelter under\nevery bush, with a piece of sacking over his shoulders to shield him\nfrom the wet. But it is far more likely that he will be obliged to run\nabout, with the water squeezing in and out of his shoes, trying to keep\ntrack of his animals; for in weather like this the mushrooms spring up\nplentifully and the animals scatter eagerly in all directions to find\nthem, scorning other food when these may be obtained. Sometimes when\nthe herder is speeding along the edge of the marsh, a pair of large,\npowerful cranes, who are on their journey south, will loom suddenly\nbefore him out of the fog. This startles him greatly, for the cranes\nseem to the herder much larger than they really are. They look like a\ncouple of great sheep with wings on.\n\nLater in the season comes a morning when all is glistening white. A\nlittle snow has fallen during the night,--not enough to last, however;\nit melts away as the day goes on. But after this the animals no longer\nlike to go up on the higher parts of the mountain. The cows stand\nlowing at the gate of the s\u00c3\u00a6ter inclosure; they know that sooner or\nlater they will be allowed to slip in there to enjoy the last of the\nmountain's good grazing. The goats look inquiringly backward as they\nare let out of the fold. Summer is over. Every one longs to go down\nagain to the home farm.\n\nAt last a day comes when the gate is opened and the cows rush into the\ns\u00c3\u00a6ter inclosure. They know now that they will not have to go up on the\nbare mountain again this year. Then the farm hands come up with pack\nhorses, and other horses that have been running wild on the mountain\nall summer are found and taken home. The packs are tied up; there is a\ngreat washing, a clearing away of rubbish and putting things in order\nfor the next summer, and at last _Bufar_ day, the long-expected day of\nreturning to the home farm, arrives.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nOn Bufar day Lisbeth Longfrock stood up on the ridge of the\nturf-covered cow-house roof, taking a final look at the surrounding\nscene. She was all ready for the journey. Her lunch bag was on her\nback, her birch-bark hat on her head, and the goat horn which Peter had\ngiven her hung on a string around her neck. In her hand she carried a\nstout stick. Within the s\u00c3\u00a6ter inclosure the cows and smaller animals\nwere roving back and forth from fence to fence impatiently. They knew\nthat Bufar day had come, for along the wall of the s\u00c3\u00a6ter hut, in a row,\nstood the horses' packs, filled with butter tubs, cheese tubs, and\ncheese boxes; and tied to the fence were the horses themselves. All of\nthese had pack saddles on, except the military horse, which stood\nforemost among them, bearing a woman's saddle. The farm hands stood\noutside, too, smoking their pipes. They were all ready, and were only\nwaiting for the milkmaid, who was inside the hut making the last batch\nof cheese from the morning's milk, which she could not allow to be\nwasted.\n\nWhile Lisbeth was standing on the ridge of the cow house Ole and Peter\ncame bobbing along past the fence of the fold. They were not so\nboisterous as usual to-day, and stopped at the gate, looking at Lisbeth\nwithout saying a word at first. Then Peter asked, \"Are you going back\nto the farm to-day, Lisbeth?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am all ready.\"\n\nWith one impulse Lisbeth and the boys gazed over the mountain's\nfamiliar expanse.\n\n\"The mountain begins to look barren now,\" said Peter; \"but I shall be\nhere a week longer.\"\n\n\"So long as that?\" said Lisbeth. \"And you, Ole?\"\n\n\"I am going day after to-morrow.\"\n\nAll three were silent again for a while. Then Lisbeth said: \"I suppose\nI must go with the others now. They surely must be ready.\"\n\nShe descended from the roof and went over to where the boys were. The\nconversation came to a standstill again; they could not think of\nanything to say. Finally Peter spoke.\n\n\"Are you coming again next summer, Lisbeth?\"\n\n\"Yes, if Kjersti Hoel is pleased with me; but that can hardly be\nexpected, since I am going home without Crookhorn.\"\n\n\"It would take a horse trainer to look after her,\" said Ole.\n\nAgain there was silence. Then Ole said: \"We did not go up to Glory Peak\nthis summer, to see the spot the king once visited.\"\n\n\"No, we didn't.\"\n\n\"We two boys are coming here again next summer, both of us.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we can go to Glory Peak after all then, even if it is so far\naway.\"\n\n\"Yes, we can,\" said Ole. \"And I can tell you a good deal about the\nking's visit, for my father went with him and drove.\"\n\n\"Drove the king's carriage?\"\n\n\"No, not the king's; the county magistrate's.\"\n\n\"My father went with him, too,\" said Peter, \"and drove; so I can tell\nabout it as well as you.\"\n\n\"Yes, but whose carriage did he drive? A homely old woman's!\"\n\n\"But that homely old woman was next in rank to the queen. She was the\none who went off to walk with the queen at the foot of Glory Peak.\"\n\nJust then came a call for Lisbeth. She hesitated a moment, then\nstretched out her little hand and said: \"Good-by. May you both fare\nwell. Thanks for this summer.\"\n\n\"Thanks to you for the same,\" said Ole. \"We are to meet again, then,\nnext summer?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"May you fare well,\" said Peter.\n\nHe stood holding her hand awhile; then, thinking he ought to say\nsomething more, he added, \"I will greet Jacob from you, Lisbeth.\"\n\nAfter that the boys vanished along the fence as noiselessly as they had\ncome.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nInside the s\u00c3\u00a6ter inclosure the farm hands were putting the packs on the\nhorses, and the military horse had been led to the gate. Lisbeth ran\ninto the inclosure, drove her animals together and counted them,\ncertainly for the tenth time that day. Soon everything stood ready for\nthe homeward march.\n\nThe milkmaid appeared in the doorway, clad in her Sunday best, as on\nthe day she came. She closed the s\u00c3\u00a6ter door with a bang, turned the\nlarge key solemnly in the lock, took it out and put it in her pocket.\nThat key she would not intrust to any one else; she wanted to deliver\nit to Kjersti Hoel with her own hand. After trying the door vigorously\nto be sure that it was securely locked, she went to the window and\nlooked in to assure herself that everything was in order and the fire\nentirely out. Then, going over to the military horse, she climbed into\nthe saddle. One of the farm hands opened the gate for her as if she had\nbeen a queen, and out she rode.\n\nAfter her followed the pack horses, one by one, and the cows in the\nsame order as when they came up,--the bell cow, Brindle, and the whole\nlong line. Behind the cows came the smaller animals, and, last of all,\nLisbeth Longfrock with a stick in her hand, her birch-bark hat on her\nhead, and her lunch bag on her back.\n\nLisbeth turned and looked at the scene she was leaving. There lay the\ns\u00c3\u00a6ter, desolate now. The mountain, too, appeared lonely and forsaken.\nOf course she, like all the others, had longed for home during these\nlast days; but it was strange, after all, for her to be going away from\neverything up here. A little of the same feeling she had had when\nleaving Peerout Castle crept over her. How singular that she should\nhappen to recall that sad time just at this moment! She had not thought\nof it at all since coming up on the mountain,--not once during the\nwhole long summer.\n\nNor would she think of it now; there were other and happier things to\nremember. God be praised, all had gone well at the s\u00c3\u00a6ter, and the whole\nprocession was on its way home. She was taking her animals safely\nback,--all except Crookhorn. Of her she had seen nothing since that day\nwhen the boys had tried to tame her; but she had heard that far off on\nthe mountain a big goat went about with a herd of horses.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nAll day long the great procession went on its way over the mountain in\nsteady, plodding fashion. The animals were fatter and heavier than in\nthe spring; they trod the hills with a brisker and firmer step, and\nnone showed any sign of being tired or lagging behind. The milkmaid was\nrosy-cheeked and plump (\"Butterpack\" she was always called in the\nautumn). As she and Lisbeth looked at the procession, one from the\nfront and the other from the rear, they agreed in thinking that the\nanimals, as well as the butter and cheese, were such as they need not\nbe ashamed to take home to Kjersti Hoel.\n\nEvening was drawing near, when suddenly the road pitched down over the\nedge of the mountain, the valley began to open before them, and they\ncould even catch a glimpse of the slope on the other side. Every one\nlooked over there, but all that could be seen as yet was a strip along\nthe uppermost edge. The only one to distinguish a house upon the strip\nwas Lisbeth Longfrock. Away up and off to one side she saw the setting\nsun glittering on a little pane of glass in a low gray hut. That hut\nwas Peerout Castle.\n\nThen all at once they came out upon the open mountain side, and the\nwhole valley lay before them, broad and peaceful, with its yellow\nfields and stacks of grain, its green spaces, and its slope of birch\ntrees flaming in yellow, with here and there a red mountain ash among\nthem. And over across they spied Hoel,--large, substantial, and well\ncared for,--with its broad, shining windows and its general air of\ncomfort. Smoke was issuing from its chimney,--such an inviting,\ncoffee-suggesting, welcoming smoke! Kjersti had probably hung the\ncoffee kettle over the fire already, so as to receive them in a\nsuitable manner.\n\nThe whole procession now began to show more life. Every member of it\nknew that Kjersti Hoel stood over there in the window watching the long\nline as it curved down the open slope. All moved forward more quickly.\nThe horses hurried ahead; the cows began to trot, the bell cow sending\nout an eager Moo-oo! across the valley; the bells jingled merrily; and\nLisbeth Longfrock trilled a vigorous call through her little goat horn.\nThey wanted every one to hear that the great company of animals\nbelonging to Hoel Farm was now coming back again.\n\nThus they hastened down to the bottom of the valley and then up the\nopposite side. It was not long before they were actually at home.\n\nKjersti Hoel herself stood at the cow-house door and opened it for\nthem. The cows recognized her, and each one of them, as they went by\nher in turn, received a word or a pat on the head; after which, proud\nand satisfied, they went to their separate stalls,--not a single cow\nmaking a mistake. They went swiftly, too, for they knew that there was\nsomething good in the mangers to welcome them. And they needed\nsomething, surely, for there had not been time to eat anything along\nthe road that day.\n\nWhen the milkmaid had dismounted from her horse Kjersti took her hand\nand said, \"Welcome home!\" Then Kjersti went over to the door of the\nsheep barn, opened that also, and counted the goats and sheep as they\nwent in; and when Lisbeth Longfrock came following in their wake,\nKjersti took her hand also and said, \"Welcome home!\"\n\n\"But,\" faltered Lisbeth, \"I have not brought Crookhorn back with me.\"\n\n\"No, I see that you have not; and it is a good thing. Now we shall be\nrid of her capers for a while. You have been a faithful and capable\nlittle worker, there is no doubt of that. And how you have grown! Why,\nyour long frock is far above your toes now!\"\n\nThen the milkmaid and Lisbeth fastened the cows in their stalls, while\nKjersti went to watch the unloading of the packs and to look at the\ntubs and boxes containing the butter and cheese that had been made at\nthe s\u00c3\u00a6ter.\n\nAfter that Kjersti came to them again and asked them to \"Please walk\nin,\" exactly as if they were grand strangers. And when they had gone\ninto the house they were invited into Kjersti's own sitting room, both\nLisbeth and the milkmaid. Here the table was set with a welcoming meal,\nand oh, how delicious the food smelled! There were large hot pancakes\nas thin as paper, and pease bread, and hot new potatoes,--the finest\nfeast you can give to people just home from a s\u00c3\u00a6ter. And Kjersti\nherself poured coffee for them and begged them to help themselves. Then\nthey had to give an account of everything that had happened on the\nmountain; to tell about the cows,--which of them had given the most\nmilk and which of them had stopped giving; about the sheep, goats, and\npigs; and about the butter and cheese that had been made. And then\nKjersti praised her two servants for their faithfulness and industry,\nand the trio rejoiced together over the success of the summer.\n\nThat evening when Lisbeth Longfrock again lay stretched out on her\nlittle bed in her room under the hall stairs and thought back over the\nsummer and about the mountain, it seemed to her that she had had a\nglorious time, as delightful as could be thought of; but, all the same,\nit was pleasant to come home again, too,--especially when one was\nwelcomed by such an unusually fine woman as Kjersti Hoel.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nAutumn was passing away. The leaves had fallen and the trees spread out\nnaked branches into the cold air. In the fields where grain had grown\nstood only the poles, now bare and slanting, on which the crops had\nbeen stacked. The verdure of the meadows was changed to yellowish\nbrown.\n\nThere was no more food for the animals out of doors, so slaughtering\nday had come. That is the end of the season for the young herder, for\non that day he gives up his responsibility. Thenceforward he is no\nlonger a person with a special duty; he must be at every one's beck and\ncall. And when winter comes with its long evenings, when the wood fire\ngleams out over the huge kitchen from the great open fireplace, while\nwool is being carded and the spinning wheel whirs, and the farm hands\nmake brooms out of twigs and whittle thole pins and ax handles, then\nmust the herder sit by the pile of twigs and logs at the side of the\nfireplace and feed the fire so that the rest can see to work while he\nstudies his lessons.\n\nBy the pile of wood in Kjersti Hoel's big kitchen Lisbeth Longfrock had\nher place on the long winter evenings. She studied and listened, and\nheard so many curious things talked about that it seemed as if the\nevenings were too short and the days too few, in spite of the long,\ndark Norwegian winter. Before she knew it spring had come again; and\nwhen she looked down at her long frock she found that the hem reached\nno farther than the tops of her ankles.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nON GLORY PEAK\n\n\nIt was again high summer, and the sun shone bright on all the mountain\ntops when, one morning, an ear-splitting call played on three goat\nhorns rang suddenly out from the inclosure belonging to Hoel s\u00c3\u00a6ter. One\ncall was thin and fine, the other two were heavier.\n\nThat triple signal meant \"Forward, march!\" Lisbeth Longfrock, Ole, and\nPeter were going to take their trip to Glory Peak to see the spot that\nhad been visited by the king.\n\nThe boys now owned goat horns to blow on, and they were good ones, too;\nfor Lisbeth Longfrock had kept her word about Crookhorn's horns and had\ngiven one to each boy.\n\nAfter Crookhorn's running off with the herd of horses, things had not\ngone any better with that proud-minded goat. When she finally came\nhome, late in the autumn, with the last of the horses, she was so\nconceited that there was no getting her to live in the barn with the\nother goats. They had to put her in the cow house; but not even the cow\nhouse was good enough for her after her summer experiences. Every time\nshe got an opportunity, out she bounded, trotting over to the door of\nthe stable as if she belonged in there. The stable boy insisted that he\nhad even heard her neigh. One day, when the men were feeding the\nhorses, they saw her dash in, and, with her usual self-important air,\nattempt to squeeze her way into the stall of the military horse. But\nthat she should not have done. It was dark, and the military horse\nfailed to see that it was only Crookhorn at his heels; so up went his\nhind legs and out went a kick that landed plump on Crookhorn's cranium\nand sent her flying against the stable wall. That was the last of\nCrookhorn.\n\nIt cannot be said that any one, except perhaps Lisbeth Longfrock,\nsorrowed particularly over her; but Lisbeth could not help remembering\nthat Crookhorn had given them milk for their coffee that winter up at\nPeerout Castle. At any rate, if not much sorrowed for, the queer,\nambitious creature was held in honorable esteem after her death. Such\nhorns as hers Ole had never seen. Not only were they extremely large,\nbut they gave out a peculiarly fine sound. Any one would know at once\nthat they were not the horns of an ordinary goat. There had always been\nsomething about Crookhorn that no one understood, Ole said. Yes, Peter\nhad noticed that too. Afterward, when he had thought a little more on\nthe subject, he said he believed that horses' horns would have exactly\nthe same sound as those of this remarkable goat, if there were any\nhorses with horns!\n\nOn the day of the visit to Glory Peak the goat horns, as musical\ninstruments, were brand-new, being used that day for the first time. In\nfact, the trip had been put off until they were ready.\n\nBut new goat horns were not the only things the travelers were provided\nwith. All three wore their best clothes, and each carried a lunch bag\nfull of food on his back and a stout stick in his hand. The trip was so\nlong that it would take a whole day.\n\nOnce more they blew their horns,--all three together. The animals\nlooked up in surprise at the unusual volume of sound, and the milkmaid\ncame to the cow-house door with a smiling face. Then off the party\nstarted. The flocks were mingled together to-day, and driven straight\nahead,--no time for them to graze by the wayside with Glory Peak lying\nso far away, blue against the sky. This excursion was a much longer one\nthan Lisbeth had ever before taken, and even Ole and Peter had been to\nGlory Peak but once.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nIt was drawing on toward dinner time when they came to the last gentle\nascent leading to the top of Glory Peak. There the juniper bushes and\n\"old woman's switches\" (dwarf birch) grew so high that the animals were\nquite lost to sight among them. Lisbeth and the boys could only see the\ncourse of their charges by a wavelike movement that passed over the\ntops of the bushes and by the sticking up of a pair of horns here and\nthere. Ole thought that this was a good place to leave the flocks for a\ntime, while they themselves went on ahead. The animals were so tired\nand hungry that they would stay there quietly for an hour or so; then,\nwhen rested, they would be sure to follow to the peak, for a goat was\nnever satisfied until it had mounted to the highest possible point,\nwhere it could look about in all directions. Ole's plan was assented\nto, and it proved to be a good one.\n\nOle led Lisbeth and Peter around a curve toward the north. He wanted to\nshow them exactly where the king and queen came up on the day of their\nvisit. To be sure, they were not really king and queen that day, but\nthey were on the very point of being: they were crown prince and crown\nprincess. They had left their horses down on the mountain side where\nthe road grew too steep for driving, and had walked the rest of the\nway. Oh, what a large company they had with them!--the county\nmagistrate, the district judge, and officers so richly dressed that\nthey could scarcely move. Seven or eight of the principal farmers of\nthe district were also in the company, and first among these were\nNordrum, Jacob's master, and the master of Hoel Farm, who was then\nliving. These two wore queer old-fashioned swallow-tailed coats. All\naround over the whole mountain top were crowds of other people gazing\nat the lively scene.\n\n\"The king looked wonderfully fine, didn't he?\" asked Lisbeth.\n\n\"No. The county magistrate looked much finer, and so did the officers,\nand even the people who waited upon them. But it could easily be seen\nthat he was the king, for he was a head taller than any of the others.\"\n\n\"The king must be tremendously strong,\" said Peter.\n\n\"Strong! Of course he is! And he must have use for every bit of his\nstrength, too, for he has to govern all the others.\"\n\n\"Was the queen also very large?\" asked Lisbeth.\n\n\"No, she was not much larger than an ordinary woman. She was unusually\nearnest and modest-looking, father said. There was not so much fuss and\nfeathers with her as with the other women folk.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Peter; \"the old frump that my father drove laughed even at\nthe magistrate, and found fault because his hands were too big.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" said Ole; \"that _was_ a joke. As if a grown-up fellow should\nnot have big fists! Anyhow, I don't see how she could have seen them,\nfor the magistrate wore his white gloves, although it was high summer.\"\n\nOle resumed the part of showman.\n\n\"Next they came up over this way,--the whole company, close by that\nvery stone there; and then the king ran on ahead of them. He wanted to\nbe the first to reach the top, as one might know. And now I will show\nyou exactly what he did. Follow me. I will be the king, and you,\nLisbeth, may be the queen. Come along!\"\n\nOle walked hastily over the last spur of the ground, the others\nfollowing. Then, running the last few steps, they found themselves\nsuddenly on the very top of the mountain! Ole threw out his hand and\nstood a long time in silence.\n\nThe others stood still also, involuntarily, impressed by the wonderful\nsight. Here and there over the endless expanse of mountain shone\nglistening lakes and mountain pools, and away off in the distance rose\nsnow-clad peaks. On every open slope lay green s\u00c3\u00a6ters; and toward the\nsouth, as far as the eye could reach, were beautiful farming districts\nand dark-green, forest-clad ridges.\n\nOle, in his character of king, threw out his hand again. \"This is the\nmost beautiful spot I have ever seen!\" he cried. Then, after a short\npause, \"Come, Sophie, and see!\" Ole took Lisbeth's hand and drew her\nforward.\n\n\"Yes,\" assented Peter, \"that is exactly the way the king did. I have\nheard about it, too.\"\n\n\"Of course it was,\" said Ole. \"Don't you think I know?\"\n\n\"What else did he do?\" asked Lisbeth.\n\n\"The king and queen then went around and spoke to all the other people,\nwho began to take out long spyglasses and gaze in all directions and\nask the name of everything.\n\n\"The county magistrate, as the highest of the local officials, stood\nnear the king and queen and pointed things out to them.\n\n\"'See that group of distant white peaks,' said the magistrate; 'and\nthere to the north is Snow-Cap, although I am not sure that you can\ndistinguish it; and that little black thing farthest away' (Ole pointed\nas the magistrate had done) 'is the highest peak in Norway.'[15]\n\n      [15] The mountain referred to is Galdhoepiggen.\n\n\"After a while the company turned around, facing the south. When they\nsaw the view in that direction,--with the great shining lake lying so\nfar away down there, and the forests stretching farther and farther in\nthe distance,--even the king himself was astonished. He thought that\nthe forests must reach almost to Sweden. He had never seen so vast an\nextent of forest at one view, king though he was. When they had\nfinished looking at the surrounding landscape, Nordrum went to that\npatch of reindeer moss over there and gathered a whole handful of it. A\ngood many of the people wondered, of course, what he was going to do\nwith it. He went over to the king, showed it to him, and then said,\n'Should you like to see the moss that we mixed with birch bark to make\nbread during the war?'\n\n\"The king took a piece and chewed it. 'Yes, there is bird lime in it,'\nhe said.\n\n\"Nobody else had moved or spoken since Nordrum picked the moss,--they\nwere so surprised. At last father heard one of the officers say, 'It is\nastonishing how tactless these farmers can be!'\"\n\n\"What is _tactless_?\" asked Lisbeth.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know; but no doubt it is something pleasant, for the king\nclapped Nordrum on the shoulder and said: 'Thanks, my good man. We can\nall thank God that there are happier days in Norway now.'\n\n\"'That was what I was thinking of when I showed you the moss,' said\nNordrum.\n\n\"Then they took the king to the great heap of stones that was piled up\nas a memorial of his visit, and asked him to scratch his name upon the\nstone slab beside it. And so he did, '_O. S._,' which stands for Oscar\nand Sophia; and then the number of the year, too,--see, here it is! It\nwas all cut into the slab afterwards, exactly as the king himself had\nscratched it.\"\n\nThe three looked at the letters. Yes, indeed, that was beautiful\nwriting, almost like print. How remarkably well the king must be able\nto write on paper, when he could write like that on stone!\n\nJust then the animals came crowding up over the edge of the mountain\ntop. They also went to the pile of stones and the big flat stone, like\na table, that stood beside it. They began to lie down, for now, after\neating, they wanted to rest.\n\n\"What else did the king and the others do?\" asked Lisbeth.\n\n\"There wasn't much more. Oh, yes! after the king had finished writing,\nhe seemed to think that they needed something to eat; so he began\nsinging to the magistrate a line from an old song that they all knew.\nThe king had a good voice and it rang out with jolly zest:\n\n    Oh, have you a drop in your bottle?\n\nThen they laughed, and came forward with a basket, and set the table on\nthe stone here. And they had something to drink, and some little cakes,\nand after that they went away again. And now,\" concluded Ole, \"I think\nthat we also need something to eat. Let us sit here at the king's table\nand have our lunch, too.\"\n\nThey took their lunch bags from their backs and sat down on the big,\nthick stone table, while the animals lay around them chewing the cud.\nWhen the bags were opened many good things came out. There was butter,\nand pork, and pease bread, and, in Lisbeth's, cream waffles besides. In\neach bag there was also a bottle of milk, except in Ole's--he had\nforgotten his. But that did not matter, for the others had plenty. They\nshared their food with each other, and when Ole wanted milk he merely\nsang,\n\n    Oh, have you a drop in your bottle?\n\nAnd so he got rather more than his share, after all.\n\nThey did not talk much at the beginning of the meal, for it was so good\nto get a chance to eat; but when they had eaten quite a while, and\ntheir jaws began to work more slowly, Peter said, as if he had been\npondering upon it, \"I wonder what the king has to eat,--for every day,\nI mean.\"\n\n\"Loppered-cream[16] porridge, all day long,\" said Ole with conviction.\n\n      [16] Cream that has been allowed to stand until it has attained a\n      jellylike consistency. Loppered milk is sometimes called\n      bonnyclabber.\n\n\"Yes; but when he wants a little solid food, once in a while?\" asked\nLisbeth.\n\nPeter had just put a very delicious piece of pork on some pease bread.\nHe looked at it with real enjoyment before eating it.\n\n\"I am sure that he has pork and pease bread,\" said he.\n\nLisbeth took the last waffle and bit a piece off. Then she said, \"Yes;\nbut the queen,--she certainly does not eat anything but cream waffles!\"\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nWhile they sat there on the stone, eating and talking, they saw a\nfigure far off on the mountain. It was coming in the direction of Glory\nPeak. So unusual is it to meet another person up on the mountain that\nit gives one a strange feeling when it happens. Soon they could think\nof nothing except this stranger.\n\n\"It must be a man trying to find his horses,\" said Ole.\n\n\"Yes, it must be, surely,\" said Peter. \"But what farmer could be\nsending up for his horses now?\"\n\n\"Let me see,--it must be Nordrum.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is true. They have only Old Blakken[17] at home now, and\nthey will have to begin their haymaking soon.\"\n\n      [17] A pet name for the dun-colored Norwegian horses.\n\n\"Yes; but this man is going on a wild-goose chase to-day. The Nordrum\nmare is over on the other side of our s\u00c3\u00a6ter. I saw her a fortnight\nago.\"\n\n\"If we set him right he can find her to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Yes, easily.\"\n\nThey sat still and watched, for they knew it would be a long time\nbefore the figure could reach them. It is so strange to watch any one\ncoming toward you on the mountain. He walks and walks, and it can be\nseen from his motions that he is walking quickly, too, but he does not\nappear to be getting the least bit nearer. He continues to seem small\nand far away, and to increase very slowly in size, because the\ndistances from point to point are so great.\n\nThe animals had risen and had begun to descend the peak in the\ndirection of the s\u00c3\u00a6ter; but they concluded to lie down again and await\nthe stranger's approach.\n\nAt last he reached them.\n\nThey had guessed aright. He was walking about trying to find the\nNordrum horses. The boys told him what they knew, and said that\nalthough he could not get them that day, he could the next day, surely.\n\nWhen the question of the horses was settled the man turned to Lisbeth.\n\n\"Isn't it you who are called Lisbeth Longfrock?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Lisbeth, \"they do call me that.\"\n\n\"Then I bring you a greeting from Jacob, your brother. I have a letter\nwith me from him. He wants me to bring him an answer, but there is no\nhurry about it until to-morrow. I shall spend the night at Hoel S\u00c3\u00a6ter,\nwhether I find the horses to-day or not. But now I must look around a\nlittle before evening comes on. I want to be sure that the horses are\nnot on this side of the s\u00c3\u00a6ter.\" So off he went.\n\nLisbeth was still sitting on the king's table. It was the first time\nshe had ever received a letter. Indeed, even Ole and Peter had never\nreceived any. They were entirely overwhelmed with respectful surprise\nand took their stand at a suitable distance.\n\nOn the outside of the letter stood:\n\n    _Salve Titel._[18]\n        To the Highly Respected Maiden,\n            Lisbeth Jacob's-daughter Longfrock,\n                at Hoel S\u00c3\u00a6ter, on the West Mountain.\n\n    At Convenience, by Messenger.\n\n        Post Free.\n\n      [18] An expression from the Latin, often used in old-fashioned\n      Norwegian correspondence. It meant, in a general way, \"Pardon any\n      error in the address.\"\n\nLisbeth broke the seal solemnly and opened the letter. Then she read,\nhalf aloud:\n\n                                   NORDRUM S\u00c3\u0086TER, 15th of this month.\n\n    _Salve Titel._\n\n    TO THE MAIDEN LISBETH LONGFROCK.\n\n    _Good Sister:_ Since time and opportunity permit, I now take my pen\n    in hand to write to you and tell you that I have nothing to write\n    about except that it is a long time since I last saw you. But I\n    have a spare day due to me from Hans. I took care of his animals\n    for him when he went to his mother's burial. It was really two\n    days, but I only reckoned it as one, because it was his mother. And\n    now I will take that day from him on the next Sunday of this month.\n    In case you have a day due to you from Peter or Ole, I write to ask\n    if you cannot take it from them. But if you have not, you can take\n    a day, all the same, because I am stronger; but I did not mean\n    anything by it when I gave Peter a thrashing last winter. So I\n    wanted to write to you and ask if we could not meet at Peerout\n    Castle, for I have not been there since--\n\n    You are requested to come to the meeting in good season. Bring\n    something to eat with you.\n\n                             With much regard,\n\n                                       Respectfully,\n\n                             Jacob Jacob's-son Nordrum, Esq.\n\n    P.S. Please answer.\n\nThat evening Lisbeth Longfrock sat with her tongue thrust into one\ncorner of her mouth, and wrote her response.\n\n\n                                    HOEL'S S\u00c3\u0086TER, 17th of this month.\n\n    TO BACHELOR JACOB JACOB'S-SON NORDRUM.\n\n    _Good Brother:_ I will now write a few words to you, and thank you\n    for your welcome letter which I have duly received. I am glad to\n    see that you are in good health. The same can be said of me, except\n    for toothache. But I will gladly come, and the milkmaid says I may\n    be away over night, because it is too far. And so Ole and Peter can\n    each have a day from me. For I have not had any day from them. They\n    wrestle almost all the time, but Peter is nearly as strong.\n\n    I must now close my poor letter to you, with many greetings from\n    them. But first and foremost are you greeted by me.\n\n                             Your affectionate sister,\n\n                                  Lisbeth Jacob's-daughter Longfrock.\n\n    P.S. Excuse the writing. Burn this letter, dear.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE VISIT TO PEEROUT CASTLE\n\n\nLate on Saturday evening Lisbeth Longfrock went jogging slowly up over\nthe hilly road to Hoel Farm. The milkmaid had given her leave to go to\nthe farm and to stay away until Monday evening.\n\nShe had risen early that day, for she would not think of such a thing\nas leaving the s\u00c3\u00a6ter before she had done her morning chores, and milked\nthe goats, and let out the cows. And she had had to do this very early,\nnot only because she was in a hurry to get away, but also because she\nknew that Ole would not oversleep himself after having insisted so\nstrongly that he should take care of her flock the first day. She had\nbarely finished when Ole came. Peter was not with him; but she had had\na talk with Peter the evening before, and he was quite as well pleased\nto take her flock on Sunday by himself, and then on Monday he and Ole\ncould watch all the flocks together.\n\nOle had been very modest and ceremonious with Lisbeth as he bade her\ngood-by. He had shaken hands and asked her to greet Jacob from him, and\nto say that he, Ole Hoegseth, would not keep close account of these\ndays Lisbeth was taking, since Jacob really needed to speak with his\nsister. He did not know, of course, that Peter had said the very same\nthing the evening before.\n\nAnd then she had given her animals over to Ole's care and had begun her\nlong walk down the mountain. She walked and she walked, hour after\nhour. She had now gone over this s\u00c3\u00a6ter road several times, but had\nnever before noticed that it was so long as it seemed to-day. She\nrested by a brook, took out her lunch, ate it and drank some water with\nit, and then set out again. In order to forget how slowly time was\npassing, she began to count her steps, first by tens and then by\nhundreds, and each time she had finished counting, she looked back to\nsee how far she had walked; but this did not avail in the least, so she\nmade up her mind to count to a thousand. When she had counted almost up\nto a thousand, she could not remember whether it was eight or nine\nhundred she had had last, so she counted four hundred more in order to\nbe altogether certain that she had counted enough.\n\nBut even that did not make the time pass any more quickly, and she did\nnot reach the point where she could look down into the valley until the\nsun was setting. The shadow had begun to creep up on the opposite side.\nAbove the dark shadow line the slope was still bathed in the rosy\nevening sunlight, but the shadow steadily ate its way upward.\n\nThen Lisbeth forgot to count her steps any more. What fun it would be\nto try to reach the sunshine again before the shadow had passed Hoel,\nwhich lay shining so brightly up there!\n\nShe went down the long slope on a run; but, run as fast as she might,\nit took time, and when she had reached the bottom of the valley and\nstarted up the hilly road on the other side, the sun had gone down. She\ncould only catch its last gleam through the tops of the spruce trees,\nand a last tiny reflection as it left the window of Peerout Castle.\n\nShe stopped to get her breath after running. It was so still and warm\nand close down there in the valley,--so different from what it had been\nup on the mountain. It seemed as if the earth sent out a deep breath\nthe moment the sun went down,--a strange, heavy fragrance that made\nher, all at once, feel anxious and downhearted, just as if she had done\nsomething wrong which she could not remember. Then it came into her\nmind that she ought to have sent word to Kjersti Hoel that she was\ncoming. People in the valley were always afraid that something was the\nmatter when a person came from the s\u00c3\u00a6ter unexpectedly; and it would be\ntoo shameful for any one to give Kjersti Hoel a fright.\n\nThat was the reason she was now jogging so slowly up over the hilly\nroad leading to Hoel Farm. She was in hopes that some one would catch\nsight of her, or that at least Bearhunter would give warning of her\napproach; for then they would see that she was not coming in haste, and\nthat she therefore could not be bringing any bad news.\n\nBut no one caught sight of her, and no one was stirring on the farm; so\nshe would have to go right in, after all.\n\nYes, Kjersti Hoel was really startled when she saw her. Lisbeth had no\ntime to offer a greeting before Kjersti said: \"What in the world! Is\nthis a mountain bird that has taken flight? There is nothing the matter\nat the s\u00c3\u00a6ter, is there?\"\n\nLisbeth made haste to answer: \"Oh, no, indeed! I was to greet you from\nthe milkmaid and say that you must not be frightened at seeing me, for\neverything is going very well with both man and beast. I have only come\ndown to make a visit and meet Jacob, my brother.\"\n\n\"God be praised!\" said Kjersti. \"And now you are heartily welcome.\"\n\nAt these words all Lisbeth's downheartedness vanished, and she felt\nonly how festive and cozy it was to be at home again. And Kjersti was\nin the best of humors. She gave Lisbeth something good to eat, and\ntreated her with as much ceremony as if she had been the milkmaid\nherself. When the time came for Lisbeth to go to bed, Kjersti went with\nher all the way to the little sleeping room under the hall stairs,\nwhich looked just as neat and orderly as when she had left it. And\nKjersti sat on the edge of the bed and asked after every single one of\nthe animals,--she remembered them all. And Lisbeth told about\neverything. There was only one provoking thing that she shrank from\nconfessing (it might as well be acknowledged first as last, however,\nfor it was sure to come out sometime), and that was her mistake in\nnaming one of the calves. She had called it Young Moolley,[19] but the\nname had proved not at all suitable, for the calf's horns had begun to\ngrow, although Lisbeth had done her best to prevent it by strewing salt\nupon them.\n\n      [19] See note on page 45.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nThe next day was Sunday, and Lisbeth thought it certainly began well\nwhen no less a person than Kjersti Hoel herself came out into the\nlittle hall room carrying a big tray with coffee and cakes on it, for\nLisbeth to indulge in as she lay in bed. Such grandeur as that Lisbeth\nhad never before experienced. She scarcely believed that such a thing\nhad ever happened to the milkmaid herself. And what was more, when she\nhopped into her long frock Kjersti said that she must hurry up and\ngrow, for there would be a new dress for her as soon as this one had\ncrept up to her knees. And although Lisbeth had not said a word about\nwhere she was going to meet Jacob, it seemed just as if Kjersti knew\nthat, too; for she made up a package with a remarkably fine lunch in\nit, and told Lisbeth that she must treat Jacob to some of it, because\nhe would probably have to go back to Nordrum S\u00c3\u00a6ter that evening and\nwould not have time to come down to Hoel. But after the lunch was put\nup Kjersti did not seem to see any necessity for further haste. In\nfact, she thought that it would not be possible for Jacob to get to\nPeerout Castle very early, because he would have to come all the way\nfrom Nordrum S\u00c3\u00a6ter that morning. So, finally, Lisbeth had to show\nKjersti her letter and point out the place where it said, \"You are\nrequested to come to the meeting in good season.\" Then, of course,\nKjersti understood that there was no time to spare.\n\nShortly afterward Lisbeth was on her way to Peerout Castle, Bearhunter\nfollowing her up the road to where the slope of birch trees began; then\nhe turned around and jogged home with the blandest and prettiest of\nSunday curls in his tail.\n\nThe valley lay before her in its quiet Sunday-morning peace. No one was\nout on the road or in the fields. Here and there in the farmhouses\nacross the valley could be seen a man leaning against the frame of the\ndoorway, bareheaded, and in shirt sleeves as white as the driven snow.\nFrom all the chimneys smoke was slowly arising in the still air.\nLisbeth looked involuntarily up at Peerout Castle. There everything\nappeared gray and desolate. No smoke ascended from its chimney; and the\nwindow eye that gazed out over the valley looked as if it was blind,\nfor the sunlight did not shine upon it now. And that brought to mind a\nblind person whom Lisbeth had once seen and whose strange, empty eyes\nmade her shiver. She felt just the same now, and her pace slackened.\nShe did not wish to get to the house before Jacob did.\n\nWhen she finally reached Peerout Castle the first thing she saw was the\npine branches that had been nailed to the gateposts the last time she\nwas there. They stood in their places still, but they were dry, and the\npine needles had fallen off. She glanced hastily at the door of the\nhouse. Yes, the pine trees stood there, too, just the same, but a\nfresher twig had been stuck in the doorlatch,--some one had evidently\nbeen there since that last day. The path that led from the gate to the\ndoor and from there over to the cow house had vanished; grass covered\nit. The cow-house door had fallen off, and around the doorposts had\ngrown up tall stinging nettles. No trace was to be seen of the foot of\nman or beast.\n\nLisbeth had rejoiced at the idea of coming back to her old home. It had\nnever entered her mind that Peerout Castle could be anything but the\npleasantest place in the whole world to come to. Now, on the contrary,\nshe felt all at once very, very lonely, more lonely than when on the\nmountain or in the forest. She felt like one who, afraid of the dark,\nis obliged to walk in it; as if every step must be taken warily, that\nno creaking be heard.\n\nWithout realizing it she veered away from the castle and the cow house,\nfeeling that she would rather go over to the big stone by the brook,\nwhere she and Jacob used to have their playthings. Perhaps it was not\nso desolate there.\n\nWhen she came to the heather ridge she saw Jacob already sitting on the\nstone. At the sight of him Lisbeth felt as if there was life again in\nall the desolation. She was so happy that she was about to run toward\nhim; but then she remembered that such behavior would not be suitable\nat a ceremonious meeting like this, and that really it was so long a\ntime since she had seen Jacob that he was almost a stranger to her.\nWhen he saw her, he jumped down from the stone and began to brush his\ngray breeches with his hands and to set his cap straight,--he wore a\ncap with a visor now, and not a straw hat like hers. Both of them were\nas embarrassed as if they were entire strangers to each other, and they\ncould not look each other in the eye while shaking hands. He made a\nheavy bob with his head, while she courtesied so low that her long\nfrock drooped down to the ground. After that, each dropped the other's\nhand and they remained standing a long time, looking around. It was not\neasy to find something to say, although both had fancied that they had\na great deal to talk about. At last Jacob thought of something. He\nlooked about for quite a while longer, and then said, as if he had\nweighed the matter deliberately and thoroughly, \"It is delightful\nweather to-day.\"\n\n\"Yes, really delightful.\"\n\n\"If it holds out a fortnight longer, it will not be bad weather for\nhaying.\"\n\n\"No, it will not be at all bad.\"\n\n\"But we can scarcely expect that.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! scarcely.\"\n\nThen there was silence again, for not much more could be said on that\nsubject. Lisbeth stole a look at Jacob. She thought of saying something\nabout his having grown so large; but then again it did not seem to her\nquite proper for her to speak first, he being the elder. The package of\nfood caught her eye,--she could certainly begin to speak about that.\n\n\"Kjersti Hoel sent you her greetings, and bade me ask if you would not\ntry to put up with the lunch she has sent to-day.\"\n\n\"Yes, thank you; but I have some with me, too.\"\n\n\"You must be hungry after your long walk.\"\n\n\"Yes, I can't say that I'm not.\"\n\n\"Then we will set the table here on the stone.\"\n\nLittle by little Lisbeth set out on the stone all the good things which\nKjersti had put in the package; and then she said, as she had heard was\nthe custom when one entertained strangers, \"Be so good as to draw up\nyour chair, Jacob.\"\n\nAnd Jacob hesitated, also according to custom, and said, \"Oh, thanks!\nbut you should not put yourself to any trouble on my account.\"\n\nThey sat down. Ceremonious manners were kept up during the first part\nof the meal, and Lisbeth did not forget to say \"please\" whenever it was\nproper. But when Jacob had eaten one of Kjersti's pancakes (a large,\nvery thin kind, spread with fresh butter or sweetmeats) and was just\nbeginning on the second, he forgot that he was at a party, so to speak,\nand said quite naturally and with conviction, \"That was a remarkably\ngood pancake!\"\n\n\"Yes, of course; it is from Hoel.\"\n\nAt that it was as if they suddenly knew each other again; as if it had\nbeen only yesterday that they had kneeled on the bench under the window\nand looked over the valley and made up their minds where they would\nlike best to live when they went out to service; as if they had never\nbeen parted from each other. And an instant after they were in eager\ndispute about which was the better place to live at, Nordrum or Hoel.\nAgree upon that question they could not; but when Jacob's appetite had\nbeen more than satisfied he finally admitted that they were both fine\nplaces, each one in its own way, and that, at any rate, those two were\nthe best in the whole valley.\n\nAnd now there was no end to all they had to talk over together and to\ntell each other. Jacob told about Nordrum and the Nordrum S\u00c3\u00a6ter and the\ngoats there; and Lisbeth told about Ole and Peter, and gave Jacob their\ngreetings. She had much to tell about them both, but Jacob thought it\nwas queer that she had more to say about Ole than about Peter; for\nwhile Ole was a straight-forward fellow, it could not be denied that he\nwas a bit of a boaster.\n\nThen they talked about their future. Jacob was going to stay at Nordrum\nFarm until he was grown up, and perhaps longer. Nordrum had said that\nwhen Jacob was a grown man and married he could take Peerout Castle,\nwith the right of buying it as soon as he was able. But Jacob thought\nthat very likely Nordrum meant it only as a joke; and anyway it was a\nlittle early for him to be thinking about marriage. Nordrum was getting\non in years, however; he would be sure to need a head man about the\nplace by that time. Lisbeth said that she was going to stay at Hoel.\nShe was as well off there as she could expect to be, for Kjersti was\nexceedingly kind to her. Lisbeth did not say anything about her\nambition to become a milkmaid. Indeed, that goal was so far off that\nshe did not dare to set her heart upon reaching it.\n\nWhen they had talked thus freely for a while they began to look around\nand call to mind all the plays they used to play and all the places\nthey used to frequent. There, right by the castle itself, they had had\ntheir cow house with its pine-cone animals--why, yonder lay the big\nbull even now! And there, on the other side of the heather ridge, had\nbeen their s\u00c3\u00a6ter, where they had driven their animals many times during\nthe summer. And there on the hill Jacob had had his sawmill, that\nLisbeth was never to touch; and farther down she had had her dairy,\nwhere he came and bought cheese in exchange for planks made out of\ncarrots that he had sliced in his sawmill. Not a stone or a mound could\nbe seen the whole way up to the stony raspberry patches on Big Hammer\nMountain that did not have some memory connected with it.\n\nThe brother and sister now felt themselves much older than when they\nhad lived at Peerout Castle. Lisbeth thought that Jacob had grown to be\nvery large, and he secretly thought the same about her. It was\ntherefore like holding a sort of festival for them to be visiting the\nscenes together and talking of their former life as of something long\ngone by, saying to each other now and then, \"Do you remember?\" What is\ntalked of in that way assumes unwonted proportions and appears to be\nwithout flaw.\n\nThus they went about the whole day,--they had even been close up to Big\nHammer itself,--and it was already late in the afternoon when they\nagain drew near Peerout Castle. They did not seem to be in any haste to\nreach it. They lingered by brook and stone to say, \"Do you remember?\"\noften both at once and about the same thing. They chased each other in\naimless fashion. Their chief idea seemed to be to think continually of\nsomething new to do, so that there should come no silent pause, and so\nthat the time of getting back to the castle should be put off as long\nas possible. Neither of them had yet mentioned a single memory\nconnected with the castle itself or with the cow house. They had not\nvisited either of these places yet, and they had avoided all mention of\ntheir mother.\n\nBut now they knew that the time had come when these sad things could be\navoided no longer. They dragged themselves slowly down over the last\nridge, talking more rapidly and nervously, and with loud and forced\nlaughter. Then suddenly their laughter ceased as if it had been cut\nstraight across,--they had come out on the ridge just back of the cow\nhouse. They became very, very quiet, and stood awhile with heads cast\ndown. Then they turned toward each other and their eyes met. It did not\nseem at all as if they had just been laughing,--their eyes were so\nstrangely big and bright. While they stood looking at each other there\ncame suddenly the \"klunk\" of a bell over from Svehaugen. At that Jacob\nshook his head, as if shaking himself free from something, and said in\na most indifferent manner, \"Do you think that is the Svehaugen bell we\nhear over there?\"\n\nLisbeth answered as unconcernedly as she could, \"Yes, it is; I remember\nit.\"\n\n\"What cow do you believe they have at Svehaugen now for their home\nmilking?\"\n\n\"We could go over there and see whether it is--Bliros.\"\n\nThat was the first time since her mother's death that Lisbeth had\nspoken Bliros's name aloud. But to do that was easier than to name her\nmother.\n\nIt was not long before Lisbeth and Jacob were on their way over to\nSvehaugen. They had gone round the castle and the cow house without\ngoing very near them,--it was not worth while to tread down the grass,\nJacob said. As they had expected, they found Bliros at Svehaugen; she\nwas standing close by the gate. And they really thought that she knew\nLisbeth again. They petted her, and talked to her, and gave her waffles\nand pancakes. It was just as if they wanted to make amends for not\nhaving had courage to stir up the memories connected with their old\nhome itself. Jacob's heart was so touched at the last that he promised\nto buy Bliros back and give her to Lisbeth as soon as he was grown up.\nAt that Lisbeth could contain herself no longer. She put her arms\naround Bliros's neck, looked at her a long time, and said, \"Do you\nbelieve, Jacob, that Bliros remembers mother?\" And then she began to\ncry.\n\nThat question came upon Jacob so unexpectedly that at first he could\nsay nothing. After a moment's struggle he, too, was crying; but he\nmanaged to declare with decision, \"Yes; if she remembers any one, it\ncertainly must be mother.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nSUNDAY AT THE S\u00c3\u0086TER\n\n\nFive summers had passed away since Lisbeth Longfrock first went up on\nthe mountain; and no one who had not seen her during those years could\nhave guessed that she had grown into the tall girl sitting by herself\none Sunday on the stone which, so far back as any herder could\nremember, had been called the Pancake Stone, and which lay hidden away\nin a distant and lonely part of the mountain. She had grown so tall\nthat the long frock, now used as a petticoat, came above her knees, and\nshe no longer wore the birch-bark hat and birch-bark shoes. On this\nspecial Sunday her Sunday kerchief was on her head, and she sat with a\nbook in her lap; for in the winter she was to go to the priest to be\nprepared for confirmation and in the spring she was to be confirmed.\nThe reading did not progress very rapidly. The book had sunk down into\nher lap, and her calm blue eyes, now grown so womanly and earnest, were\nroving from one to another of the dear familiar places about her. Her\nflock lay quietly around the stone, chewing the cud. Indian summer was\nnear its close. The sky was high vaulted and the air clear and cool. As\nfar as the eye could reach all things were sketched in sharpest\noutline. Hills and marshes already glowed in autumnal tints, for these\nmake their triumphal entry on the mountains earlier than below. The sun\nshone tranquilly and, as it were, a little coolly also. Everything was\nvery still. Not even the sound of a bell was heard, for the animals\nwere taking their afternoon rest; and no movement was discernible\nexcept far, far away, where Lisbeth spied a falcon flapping out from\nGlory Peak.\n\nJust as it was now had Lisbeth seen the mountain at the close of each\nsummer all these years. It had become familiar and dear to her, and she\nthought to herself how unchanging it was through all its variableness,\nwhile so much else altered never to be the same again. For much had\nchanged since she first sat on this same stone and looked out over this\nsame landscape. Few of the animals she now took care of had belonged to\nher original flock; the oldest had gone out and new ones had come in.\nThe unlucky Morskol (Mother's Moolley) was now a full-grown cow, with\nhorns of more than usual beauty. The former milkmaid was gone and\nanother had taken her place. Ole and Peter, with whom Lisbeth in\nearlier years had tended her flock almost daily, were her companions\nno longer. They had not been up at the s\u00c3\u00a6ter since they were\nconfirmed,--two years ago. Ole had even sailed to America. Lisbeth had\nmissed the boys very much, and had many a time been lonely during the\nlast two summers, for no new herders had come from the Hoegseth or\nLunde farms. At home, too, at the Hoel Farm, there had been changes\namong the people, and Bearhunter had become blind. Lisbeth herself no\nlonger occupied her old place by the heap of firewood in the great\nkitchen on winter evenings, but sat beside Kjersti on the wooden\ncarving bench; that is, she sat there when she did not have to study\nher catechism or learn her hymns to be ready for school the next day.\n\nAnd now still further changes were in store for her. This was to be the\nlast summer she would be sitting up here tending her flock. What would\ncome next? Kjersti Hoel had not said anything to her about the\nfuture,--perhaps Kjersti would not want her any longer. But Lisbeth put\nthese thoughts aside,--she would not allow her mind to dwell on such\nperplexing subjects when all was so delightfully peaceful and beautiful\naround her. Whatever her lot might be, or wherever she might go, of one\nthing she was certain,--she would never forget these mountain scenes\nnor this stone which had always been her favorite resting place,\nespecially since she had been so much alone; and she gazed around her\nagain.\n\nAs her eyes wandered about she caught sight of a man far off on the\nmarsh, sauntering along in her direction, stopping once in a while and\nstooping down, apparently to pluck an occasional cloudberry, for they\nwere now beginning to ripen. This sent her thoughts into another\nchannel.\n\nWho could it be coming over the marsh? Not a man looking for horses,\nfor no one goes out for that purpose on Sunday; nor a cloudberry\npicker, for the berries were not yet ripe enough to pay for the trouble\nof seeking. Surely it was some one who had made the ascent of the\nmountain for pleasure only. What if it should be Jacob! She had not\nseen him since the last autumn, and he had said then that he would come\nup to see her this summer. Nevertheless the young man did not look like\nJacob; and Jacob, not being very well acquainted on the western\nmountain, would not be trying to find the Pancake Stone. Yet this\nperson was steering his course exactly toward where she sat, and it was\nplain that he knew the marsh thoroughly,--where the cloudberries grew,\nand where it was not so wet but that you could get across. It could not\npossibly be----? She blushed the instant she thought of the name, and\nat the same moment the stranger disappeared behind a hill, so that she\nsaw no more of him for the time.\n\nInvoluntarily she tied her kerchief freshly under her chin, stroked her\nlight hair under the edge of the kerchief, and smoothed out the folds\nin her skirt. Then, sitting with her back half turned to the quarter\nwhere he might be expected to appear, she took up her book and bent her\nhead over it as if reading.\n\nShortly afterward a young man shot up over the hill behind her. He had\non brand-new gray woolen clothes, a \"bought\" scarf around his neck, and\ntop-boots outside his trousers. He was not tall, but his figure was\nwell knit and manly. In his youthful face, on which the merest shadow\nof down could be distinguished, was set a pair of brown eyes, trusting\nand trustworthy. He stopped a moment and looked down at the open space\nwhere Lisbeth sat upon the stone with the flock of animals around her.\nIt was evident that he had a memory of the scene,--that he had seen\nthat picture before. Lisbeth did not look up, but she knew he was\nthere,--felt in her back, so to speak, that he was standing there\ngazing at her. He smiled and then swung his course around so as to\napproach her from the side, and so that the animals might have time to\nbecome gently aware of his presence and not scramble up in a flurry.\nSilently he drew near to her, until at last his shadow fell upon her\nbook. Then she looked up and their eyes met. At that both of them\nflushed a little, and he said hastily, \"Good day, Lisbeth Longfrock.\"\n\n\"Good day. Why, is it you, Peter, out for a walk?\"\n\nThey shook hands.\n\n\"Yes; I thought it would be pleasant to have a look at the old places\nagain; and since Jacob was coming up to visit you, I made up my mind to\nkeep him company.\"\n\n\"Is Jacob with you?\"\n\n\"Yes, but he is waiting down at the s\u00c3\u00a6ter, for he was tired. We were\nout early to-day, and tomorrow we are to take home a pair of nags to\nHoegseth Farm. He sent you his greeting and will see you this evening.\"\n\n\"Were you sure that you could find me?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! I knew just about where you would be in such weather. And, of\ncourse, it is more fun for me to ramble around here than for him, I\nbeing so familiar with the region.\"\n\nHe sat down beside her on the stone and gazed slowly around.\n\n\"Does it look natural here?\"\n\n\"Yes, everything is unaltered. It seems only yesterday that I was here\ntaking care of the Lunde flocks. But I hardly recognized _you_ again.\nYou have grown so large.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"Yes. But still it is two years since I last saw you.\"\n\nThere was a short pause. Then Peter continued: \"I walked over Sloping\nMarsh, by our bathing pond. The water has all run out.\"\n\n\"Yes, it has.\"\n\n\"I wondered if it would not be a good plan for me to build the dam up\nagain, so that you could use the pond.\"\n\n\"No, you need not do that, for I have my bathing place somewhere\nelse,--a place that no one knows about.\"\n\n\"Oh, have you?\"\n\n\"Yes; I had it the last year that you and Ole were here, too.\"\n\n\"So it was there you used to be on the days that you kept away from\nus?\"\n\n\"Yes, sometimes.\"\n\nThe animals began to get up and stray off, thus attracting attention.\nLisbeth made Peter look at the older goats to see if he recognized\nthem, and she was glad to find that he did remember them all. Then she\ntold him about the new ones; but soon that topic was exhausted and\nthere was apparently nothing more to talk about. They still remained\nseated on the stone. Then Peter said, \"You haven't that birch-bark hat\nany longer, have you, Lisbeth?\"\n\n\"No; it was worn out long ago.\"\n\n\"But what is it you have on this string?\"\n\nHe took hold carefully of a string she wore around her neck, and,\npulling it, drew out from her bosom the little goat horn he had given\nher.\n\n\"I did not think you would have that horn still,\" said Peter.\n\nA deep blush covered Lisbeth's face at the idea of appearing childish\nto Peter. She hastened to say, \"Oh, yes; I carry it with me sometimes.\"\n\n\"I have mine, too. It is the only thing I have left from my herding\ndays.\" And he drew one of Crookhorn's horns out of an inner pocket.\n\"Shall we try them?\"\n\nThen they both laughed and played \"The Old Woman with a Stick\"\ntogether, as they had so often done in the old days. It did not sound\nas if either of them had forgotten it in the least. When the tune was\nfinished there was another pause. At last Lisbeth said, \"I must look\nafter the animals a little now, or I shall lose track of them.\"\n\n\"Can't you let them go home alone to-night? It is time for them to seek\nthe fold, and they will surely find the way safely. Then we can walk to\nthe s\u00c3\u00a6ter more at our leisure.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will gladly. I can trust them to find their way home, I am\nsure.\"\n\nAgain there was silence for a time. Then Lisbeth rose, saying, \"I think\nwe must go now.\"\n\nPeter did not stir. He merely said very quietly: \"Can't you sit a\nlittle longer? There was something I wanted to ask you.\"\n\nLisbeth bowed her head and seated herself again without speaking.\n\n\"I have a greeting to you from Ole. I received a letter from him a\nfortnight ago. He asked me very particularly to give you his\ngreetings.\"\n\n\"Thank you. Is all going well with him?\"\n\n\"Yes, it seems so from his letter. He has a good place and earns large\nwages.\"\n\n\"Ole deserves it. He grew to be a fine fellow.\"\n\n\"Yes, he did. He asks me whether I will go to America in the spring. He\nwill send me a ticket, if I will.\"\n\nOn hearing that Lisbeth looked up at Peter for an instant, then drooped\nher head again without saying a word. Peter continued: \"It was that I\nwanted to ask you about. Do you wish me to go?\"\n\nA dead silence ensued, during which Peter sat looking inquiringly at\nher. For a long time she was motionless; then, suddenly lifting her\nhead, she fastened her blue eyes upon him and said, \"No, I do _not_\nwish you to go.\"\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nThere was no more conversation on that subject, and soon they were on\ntheir way to the s\u00c3\u00a6ter. They went around by all the familiar, memorable\nplaces, including both the bathing pond and Pointing Stump; and all\nthese places had so many reminders for them of the time when they\nwatched their flocks together there, that more than once they said how\nmuch they pitied Ole, who would perhaps never be able to come to Norway\nagain. The sky arched high and clear above them, the mountain stretched\nbeyond them with its unending, silent wastes; and Lisbeth and Peter\nfelt strangely buoyant and glad. Although they had made no agreement,\nthey felt as if they had a hidden bond between them--as if they two had\na wonderful secret that no one, not even Jacob, could share.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nLISBETH APPOINTED HEAD MILKMAID\n\n\nIt was the first Sunday after Easter, early in the morning. Lisbeth sat\nby the small table in her little sleeping room, with one elbow leaning\non the table and her hand under her chin, while she stared down at a\nbig black book which lay open before her. The book was the New\nTestament, and Lisbeth's lips moved softly as she read. That morning,\nfor the first time in several years, she had not gone into the cow\nhouse. Kjersti Hoel had said that she was to have a couple of hours in\nwhich she could be alone. No one was to disturb her.\n\nShe sat there somewhat stiff and helpless, in a long black dress with a\nstrip of white in the neck. The dress seemed to her rather tight, so\ntight that she held her elbows close to her side and hardly dared to\nbend her back. It was the first time she had had a close-fitting dress\non,--her usual costume being a jacket and skirt. Her light hair was\ndrawn smoothly back and twisted into a knot at her neck. That was for\nthe first time, too. She was a trifle paler than usual, and her lips,\nas she moved them, were dark red and dewy; but her eyes shone with\npeace. All in all, she was beautiful, as she sat there in her little\nroom waiting for church time to come. This was the day that she was to\nbe confirmed.\n\nA knock was heard at the door, and in stepped Kjersti Hoel. She also\nwas dressed in her very best,--an old-fashioned black dress with a\ngathered waist, and a freshly ironed cap with a frill around the face\nand strings hanging down. In her hand she carried the big psalm book, a\nhandsome one printed in large type, which she used only on the greatest\noccasions. On top of the psalm book lay a neatly folded pocket\nhandkerchief.\n\nStanding still for a moment and looking earnestly at Lisbeth, Kjersti\nsaid, \"Do you think you are ready now, Lisbeth?\"\n\nLisbeth answered quietly, \"Yes, I think so.\"\n\n\"Then it is time for us to start. Come, let me tie your kerchief, so\nthat your hair will not get untidy.\"\n\nShe tied the kerchief on Lisbeth's head and then they went slowly out\nthrough the hall way. Outside, at the door, stood the broad wagon with\nthe military horse harnessed to it.\n\n\"You may come and sit up here by me, Lisbeth,\" said Kjersti.\n\nSo they both got into the wagon and drove off. Not a word was spoken\nthe whole way. As they drove down the hill from the farm and out on the\nmain road, they were encompassed by all the effervescence of the\nspring,--its myriads of sights, sounds, and odors. The brooks and\nrivers rushed tunefully along, birds by the thousands were singing and\ncalling, insects were buzzing, trees and plants of many sorts were\npouring their fragrance over the whole valley; and above it all stood\nthe sun, shedding down its glittering light. But these things failed to\narouse in Lisbeth the feelings they usually awakened. They had,\ninstead, the effect of a roar and a disturbance, of something\ninharmonious that caused her to quiver with discomfort. Involuntarily\nshe drew nearer to Kjersti on the wagon seat. She felt a longing for\none thing only,--silence. Thus they drove for a while along the sunlit\nvalley road.\n\nThen suddenly a broad wave of sound came rolling toward them. The\nchurch bells were adding their tones--broad, peaceful, sure--to the\ngeneral chorus. They did not drown the sounds of the spring, but took\nthem up, as it were, and ordered them, harmonized them, used them as a\ngentle accompaniment; so that the whole seemed like a great psalm\nsinging and organ playing.\n\nAt the sound of the bells there came to Lisbeth a feeling of peace,\nsolemnity, and holiness, such as she had never known before. She felt\nlifted up. A change came over the world about her: everything became\nlighter, loftier, as if prepared for a sacred festival. She felt a\nmighty gladness within her.\n\nFrom that time on she had but a confused consciousness of what took\nplace. On arriving at the church she thought that the gathering of\npeople around it had never been so large or so reverent in demeanor,\nand that the church had never looked so tall and shining.\n\nAs she went inside and walked up the church aisle she felt very erect\nand free. The same wonderful light was within the church, too. And when\nshe looked down the lines of those who were to be confirmed with her,\nas they stood with bowed heads on each side of the middle aisle, she\nthought that their faces were strangely radiant.\n\nWhen the priest came into the chancel it seemed to her that he was much\nlarger than ever before, and that his face was, oh, so mild! He began\nto speak; and though she did not really hear or understand what he\nsaid, she felt that it was something great and good, and it thrilled\nher like music.\n\nAs soon as the psalm singing began she joined in with a stronger voice\nthan usual, her breast swelling involuntarily. When it came her turn to\nbe questioned she hardly knew whether she had heard what the priest\nasked or not, but she was sure, nevertheless, that her answer, which\ncame forth clear and firm, was the right one. And when she knelt down\nand gave the priest her hand, as the ceremony required, it seemed to\nher that the awkward figures in the old altar pictures smiled\nbenignantly upon her.\n\nShe did not come wholly to herself until the confirmation ceremony was\nentirely over and she had gone to her seat beside Kjersti Hoel in one\nof the church pews.\n\nAs Lisbeth drew near, Kjersti took her hand and said half aloud, \"May\nit bring you happiness and blessing, Lisbeth!\"\n\nLisbeth stood a moment, looked up at Kjersti as if just awakening,\nsmiled, and whispered softly, \"Thanks, Kjersti Hoel.\"\n\nThen, when the service was over, they walked out of church.\n\nOutside the church door stood Jacob and Peter. They lifted their caps\nto Kjersti and shook hands with her. Afterward they shook hands with\nLisbeth, lifting their caps to her, too, which had not been their\ncustom before her confirmation. They also said to her, \"May it bring\nyou happiness and blessing!\"\n\nAfter that Kjersti and Lisbeth walked about the grassy space in front\nof the church. They made slow progress, because there were so many\npeople who wanted to greet the mistress of Hoel and to ask what girl it\nwas that she had presented for confirmation on that day. At last they\nreached the broad wagon, to which the horse had already been harnessed,\nand, mounting into it, they set forth on their homeward way, returning\nin silence, as they had come. Not until they had reached home did\nKjersti say, \"You would like to be alone awhile this afternoon, too?\"\n\n\"Yes, thank you,\" responded Lisbeth.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *\n\nIn the afternoon Lisbeth Longfrock again sat alone in the little room\nin the hall way. Bearhunter, who had now become blind, lay outside her\ndoor. Whenever he was not in the kitchen, where, as a rule, he kept to\nhis own corner, he lay at Lisbeth's door, having chosen this place in\npreference to his old one on the flat stone in front of the house. To\nlie on the doorstep where so many went out and in--and nowadays they\nwent so rudely--was too exciting for him; but Lisbeth always stepped\nconsiderately.\n\nAs Lisbeth sat there in her room she was not reading in any book; in\nfact, she was doing nothing at all. Spread out on the bed before her\nlay her long frock, which she had not used that winter. It looked very\nsmall and worn.\n\nWhen she had come into her room, where the afternoon sun fell slantwise\nupon the coverlet of her bed, picturing there the small window frame,\nshe had had a wonderful feeling of peace and contentment. It seemed to\nher that there was not the least need of thinking about serious things\nor of reading, either. She felt that the simplest and most natural\nthing to do was merely to busy herself happily, without putting her\nthoughts on anything in particular. She had no earthly possessions of\nvalue, but she did have a small chest which she had received in the\nsecond year of her stay at Hoel, and in this chest there was a tiny\nside box and also a space in the lid where she had stored away the\nlittle she owned that seemed worth keeping. She had pulled the chest\nforward and opened it. To take the things out, look at each one, and\nrecall the memories connected with them was very pleasant.\n\nThere was a good-for-nothing old pocketknife that had been given to her\nby Ole the first summer on the mountain. There was a letter from Ole,\ntoo, that she had received the last autumn, and that no one knew about.\nIn it he had asked if he might send her and Jacob tickets to America\nafter she had been confirmed. She had not answered the letter yet, but\nshe would do it soon now, and thank him, and say that she was not\ncoming,--for she knew that she could never leave Norway.\n\nAnd then she took out the goat horn that Peter had given her. She was\nseized with a strong desire to play on it, but did not dare to, because\nit would sound so strange in the house. Next to the place where the\ngoat horn had lain was a silk neckerchief that Peter had given her for\nChristmas. He had sent it by Jacob. She herself had not seen or spoken\nwith Peter since that Sunday last year when he had found her on the\nmountain, until to-day at the church.\n\nAnd there was the letter she had received from Jacob in regard to their\nmeeting at Peerout Castle. It was the only letter she had ever had from\nhim,--Jacob was not one to write much; but she had a few small gifts\nthat he had sent her.\n\nDown at the very bottom of the chest lay a kerchief that she had never\ntaken out before,--her mother's kerchief. It seemed to Lisbeth that now\nwas the first time she had really dared to think about her mother. She\ntook out the kerchief and spread it on the bed; and when, as she did\nso, her eye caught sight of her old long frock hanging on the wall, she\nspread that, too, on the bed. Then she seated herself and gazed upon\nthese simple objects. The time had arrived when it was possible for her\nto look back without becoming hopelessly sorrowful; when she could\nponder over the rich memories which these poor relics hid,--the\nmemories from Peerout Castle not being the least precious. She sat\nnourishing these thoughts a long time, beginning at the beginning, as\nfar back as she could remember, and going forward to this very Sunday.\nThe memories came easily and in regular succession, and all of them\nwere good memories. Everything that had seemed hard at the time either\nhad been forgotten or was seen now in a softer light.\n\nSuddenly there came a knock at the door; and before Lisbeth had had\ntime to conceal the things, or presence of mind enough to rise from her\nchair, in walked Kjersti Hoel.\n\nLisbeth saw that Kjersti noticed the things at once, but she was not in\nthe least embarrassed, for Kjersti only smiled kindly and said: \"I see\nthat you are thinking about your mother to-day, Lisbeth, and that is\nright; but now come with me into my room. There is something I wish to\ntalk with you about.\"\n\nLisbeth was half alarmed at this, for never before had Kjersti spoken\nso seriously to her; but she rose quietly and did as she was bidden.\n\nKjersti went ahead, through the kitchen and across to the door of her\nown room, Lisbeth following close behind her. The others in the kitchen\nlooked at them curiously, wondering what was going to happen.\n\nOnce in her room, Kjersti took a seat beside the table and asked\nLisbeth to sit at the opposite side. Then said Kjersti: \"You are now\ngrown up, Lisbeth Longfrock, and hereafter you will be free to decide\nthings for yourself. I have kept the last promise I made to your\nmother, and I can to-day say that it has been only a pleasure for me to\ndo so. You have turned out well, as may be expected of every good girl;\nif you do as well in the future, I really believe that your mother\nwould be satisfied with both you and me. But from to-day I have no\nlonger any right to decide things for you. You must decide for yourself\nwhat you will do and what you think is right. I will therefore ask\nyou--and you are to choose with entire freedom--whether you wish to\nstay here with me any longer, or whether, now that you are to earn your\nown living, you would rather try something else. I can add that I\nshould like very much to have you stay here.\"\n\nFor a while there was a deep silence. Then Lisbeth looked up with big\ntears in her eyes and said, \"I should like to stay with you, Kjersti\nHoel, as long as you are pleased with me.\"\n\n\"That is what I thought, and therefore I have also thought of another\nthing. Of course you are very young yet, but it is not always unwise to\nput responsibility on young shoulders. You have shown yourself so\nfaithful and capable, not only at the cow house but at the s\u00c3\u00a6ter as\nwell, that I have no fear in intrusting both to your care. If you wish\nit to be so, I will now appoint you head milkmaid at Hoel Farm.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Lisbeth Longfrock, by Hans Aanrud\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LISBETH LONGFROCK ***\n\n***** This file should be named 26348-8.txt or 26348-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/6\/3\/4\/26348\/\n\nProduced by Chris Curnow, Joseph Cooper and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http:\/\/www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1104,"split":"test"}
