Conan Doyle was \"strongly of the opinion\" that the crimes committed on the Congo were \"the greatest to be ever known\",and he lauded the work of the Congo Reform Association. Conan Doyle was dismissive of the annexation of the state by Belgium, a situation intended to end the personal rule of the King.

CONAN DOYLE\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n\nThere are many of us in England who consider the crime which has been\nwrought in the Congo lands by King Leopold of Belgium and his followers to\nbe the greatest which has ever been known in human annals. Personally I am\nstrongly of that opinion. There have been great expropriations like that\nof the Normans in England or of the English in Ireland. There have been\nmassacres of populations like that of the South Americans by the Spaniards\nor of subject nations by the Turks. But never before has there been such a\nmixture of wholesale expropriation and wholesale massacre all done under\nan odious guise of philanthropy and with the lowest commercial motives as\na reason. It is this sordid cause and the unctious hypocrisy which makes\nthis crime unparalleled in its horror.\n\nThe witnesses of the crime are of all nations, and there is no possibility\nof error concerning facts. There are British consuls like Casement,\nThesiger, Mitchell and Armstrong, all writing in their official capacity\nwith every detail of fact and date. There are Frenchmen like Pierre Mille\nand F\u00c3\u00a9licien Challaye, both of whom have written books upon the subject.\nThere are missionaries of many races--Harris, Weeks and Stannard\n(British); Morrison, Clarke and Shepherd (American); Sjoblom (Swedish) and\nFather Vermeersch, the Jesuit. There is the eloquent action of the Italian\nGovernment, who refused to allow Italian officers to be employed any\nlonger in such hangman's work, and there is the report of the Belgian\ncommission, the evidence before which was suppressed because it was too\ndreadful for publication; finally, there is the incorruptible evidence of\nthe kodak. Any American citizen who will glance at Mark Twain's \"King\nLeopold's Soliloquy\" will see some samples of that. A perusal of all of\nthese sources of information will show that there is not a grotesque,\nobscene or ferocious torture which human ingenuity could invent which has\nnot been used against these harmless and helpless people.\n\nThis would, to my mind, warrant our intervention in any case. Turkey has\nseveral times been interfered with simply on the general ground of\nhumanity. There is in this instance a very special reason why America and\nEngland should not stand by and see these people done to death. They are,\nin a sense, their wards. America was the first to give official\nrecognition to King Leopold's enterprise in 1884, and so has the\nresponsibility of having actually put him into that position which he has\nso dreadfully abused. She has been the indirect and innocent cause of the\nwhole tragedy. Surely some reparation is due. On the other hand England\nhas, with the other European Powers, signed the treaty of 1885, by which\neach and all of them make it responsible for the condition of the native\nraces. The other Powers have so far shown no desire to live up to this\npledge. But the conscience of England is uneasy and she is slowly rousing\nherself to act. Will America be behind?\n\nAt this moment two American citizens, Shepherd and that noble Virginian,\nMorrison, are about to be tried at Boma for telling the truth about the\nscoundrels. Morrison in the dock makes a finer Statue of Liberty than\nBartholdi's in New York harbour.\n\nAttempts will be made in America (for the Congo has its paid apologists\neverywhere) to pretend that England wants to oust Belgium from her colony\nand take it herself. Such accusations are folly. To run a tropical colony\nhonestly without enslaving the natives is an expensive process. For\nexample Nigeria, the nearest English colony, has to be subsidized to the\nextent of $2,000,000 a year. Whoever takes over the Congo will,\nconsidering its present demoralized condition, have a certain expense of\n$10,000,000 a year for twenty years. Belgium has not run the colony. It\nhas simply sacked it, forcing the inhabitants without pay to ship\neverything of value to Antwerp. No decent European Power could do this.\nFor many years to come the Congo will be a heavy expense and it will truly\nbe a philanthropic call upon the next owner. I trust it will not fall to\nEngland.\n\nAttempts have been made too (for there is considerable ingenuity and\nunlimited money on the other side) to pretend that it is a question of\nProtestant missions against Catholic. Any one who thinks this should read\nthe book, \"La Question Kongolaise,\" of the eloquent and holy Jesuit,\nFather Vermeersch. He lived in the country and, as he says, it was the\nsight of the \"immeasurable misery,\" which drove him to write.\n\nWe English who are earnest over this matter look eagerly to the westward\nto see some sign of moral support of material leading. It would be a grand\nsight to see the banner of humanity and civilization carried forward in\nsuch a cause by the two great English-speaking nations.\n\nARTHUR CONAN DOYLE.\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nI am convinced that the reason why public opinion has not been more\nsensitive upon the question of the Congo Free State, is that the terrible\nstory has not been brought thoroughly home to the people. Mr. E. D. Morel\nhas done the work of ten men, and the Congo Reform Association has\nstruggled hard with very scanty means; but their time and energies have,\nfor the most part, been absorbed in dealing with each fresh phase of the\nsituation as it arose. There is room, therefore, as it seemed to me, for a\ngeneral account which would cover the whole field and bring the matter up\nto date. This account must necessarily be a superficial one, if it is to\nbe produced at such a size and such a price, as will ensure its getting at\nthat general public for which it has been prepared. Yet it contains the\nessential facts, and will enable the reader to form his own opinion upon\nthe situation.\n\nShould he, after reading it, desire to help in the work of forcing this\nquestion to the front, he can do so in several ways. He can join the Congo\nReform Association (Granville House, Arundel Street, W. C.). He can write\nto his local member and aid in getting up local meetings to ventilate the\nquestion. Finally, he can pass this book on and purchase other copies, for\nany profits will be used in setting the facts before the French and German\npublic.\n\nIt may be objected that this is ancient history, and that the greater part\nof it refers to a period before the Congo State was annexed to Belgium on\nAugust 10th, 1908. But responsibility cannot be so easily shaken off. The\nCongo State was founded by the Belgian King, and exploited by Belgian\ncapital, Belgian soldiers and Belgian concessionnaires. It was defended\nand upheld by successive Belgian Governments, who did all they could to\ndiscourage the Reformers. In spite of legal quibbles, it is an insult to\ncommon sense to suppose that the responsibility for the Congo has not\nalways rested with Belgium. The Belgian machinery was always ready to help\nand defend the State, but never to hold it in control and restrain it from\ncrime.\n\nOne chance Belgium had. If immediately upon taking over the State they had\nformed a Judicial Commission for the rigid inspection of the whole matter,\nwith power to punish for all past offences, and to examine all the\nscandals of recent years, then they would have done something to clear the\npast. If on the top of that they had freed the land, given up the system\nof forced labour entirely, and cancelled the charters of all the\nconcessionnaire companies, for the obvious reason that they have\nnotoriously abused their powers, then Belgium could go forward in its\ncolonizing enterprise on the same terms as other States, with her sins\nexpiated so far as expiation is now possible.\n\nShe did none of these things. For a year now she has herself persevered in\nthe evil ways of her predecessor. Her colony is a scandal before the whole\nworld. The era of murders and mutilations has, as we hope, passed by, but\nthe country is sunk into a state of cowed and hopeless slavery. It is not\na new story, but merely another stage of the same story. When Belgium took\nover the Congo State, she took over its history and its responsibilities\nalso. What a load that was is indicated in these pages.\n\nThe record of the dates is the measure of our patience. Can any one say\nthat we are precipitate if we now brush aside vain words and say\ndefinitely that the matter has to be set right by a certain near date, or\nthat we will appeal to each and all of the Powers, with the evidence\nbefore them, to assist us in setting it right? If the Powers refuse to do\nso, then it is our duty to honour the guarantees which we made as to the\nsafety of these poor people, and to turn to the task of setting it right\nourselves. If the Powers join in, or give us a mandate, all the better.\nBut we have a mandate from something higher than the Powers which obliges\nus to act.\n\nSir Edward Grey has told us in his speech of July 22nd, 1909, that a\ndanger to European peace lies in the matter. Let us look this danger\nsquarely in the face. Whence does it come? Is it from Germany, with her\ntraditions of kindly home life--is this the power which would raise a hand\nto help the butchers of the Mongalla and of the Domaine de la Couronne? Is\nit likely that those who so justly admire the splendid private and public\nexample of William II. would draw the sword for Leopold? Both in the name\nof trade rights and in that of humanity Germany has a long score to settle\non the Congo. Or is it the United States which would stand in the way,\nwhen her citizens have vied with our own in withstanding and exposing\nthese iniquities? Or, lastly, is France the danger? There are those who\nthink that because France has capital invested in these enterprises,\nbecause the French Congo has itself degenerated under the influence and\nexample of its neighbour, and because France holds a right of pre-emption,\nthat therefore our trouble lies across the Channel. For my own part, I\ncannot believe it. I know too well the generous, chivalrous instincts of\nthe French people. I know, also, that their colonial record during\ncenturies has been hardly inferior to our own. Such traditions are not\nlightly set aside, and all will soon be right again when a strong Colonial\nMinister turns his attention to the concessionnaires in the French Congo.\nThey will remember de Brazza's dying words: \"Our Congo must not be turned\ninto a Mongalla.\" It is an impossibility that France could ally herself\nwith King Leopold, and certainly if such were, indeed, the case, the\n_entente cordiale_ would be strained to breaking. Surely, then, if these\nthree Powers, the ones most directly involved, have such obvious reasons\nfor helping, rather than hindering, we may go forward without fear. But if\nit were not so, if all Europe frowned upon our enterprise, we would not be\nworthy to be the sons of our fathers if we did not go forward on the plain\npath of national duty.\n\nARTHUR CONAN DOYLE.\n\n  Windlesham, Crowborough,\n      September, 1909.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\n                                                  PAGE\n\n  Preface                                          iii\n\n  Introduction                                     vii\n\n  How the Congo Free State Came to be Founded        3\n\n  The Development of the Congo State                 9\n\n  The Working of the System                         22\n\n  First Fruits of the System                        27\n\n  Further Fruits of the System                      39\n\n  Voices from the Darkness                          46\n\n  Consul Roger Casement's Report                    57\n\n  King Leopold's Commission and Its Report          68\n\n  The Congo After the Commission                    87\n\n  Some Catholic Testimony as to the Congo           97\n\n  The Evidence Up to Date                          102\n\n  The Political Situation                          114\n\n  Some Congolese Apologies                         118\n\n  Solutions                                        123\n\n  Appendix                                         127\n\n\n\n\nTHE CRIME OF THE CONGO\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nHOW THE CONGO FREE STATE CAME TO BE FOUNDED\n\n\nIn the earlier years of his reign King Leopold of Belgium began to display\nthat interest in Central Africa which for a long time was ascribed to\nnobility and philanthropy, until the contrast between such motives, and\nthe actual unscrupulous commercialism, became too glaring to be sustained.\nAs far back as the year 1876 he called a conference of humanitarians and\ntravellers, who met at Brussels for the purpose of debating various plans\nby which the Dark Continent might be opened up. From this conference\nsprang the so-called International African Association, which, in spite of\nits name, was almost entirely a Belgian body, with the Belgian King as\nPresident. Its professed object was the exploration of the country and the\nfounding of stations which should be rest-houses for travellers and\ncentres of civilization.\n\nOn the return of Stanley from his great journey in 1878, he was met at\nMarseilles by a representative from the King of Belgium, who enrolled the\nfamous traveller as an agent for his Association. The immediate task given\nto Stanley was to open up the Congo for trade, and to make such terms with\nthe natives as would enable stations to be built and dep\u00c3\u00b4ts established.\nIn 1879 Stanley was at work with characteristic energy. His own intentions\nwere admirable. \"We shall require but mere contact,\" he wrote, \"to satisfy\nthe natives that our intentions are pure and honourable, seeking their own\ngood, materially and socially, more than our own interests. We go to\nspread what blessings arise from amiable and just intercourse with people\nwho have been strangers to them.\" Stanley was a hard man, but he was no\nhypocrite. What he said he undoubtedly meant. It is worth remarking, in\nview of the accounts of the laziness or stupidity of the natives given by\nKing Leopold's apologists in order to justify their conduct toward them,\nthat Stanley had the very highest opinion of their industry and commercial\nability. The following extracts from his writings set this matter beyond\nall doubt:\n\n    \"Bolobo is a great centre for the ivory and camwood powder trade,\n    principally because its people are so enterprising.\"\n\nOf Irebu--\"a Venice of the Congo\"--he says:\n\n    \"These people were really acquainted with many lands and tribes on the\n    Upper Congo. From Stanley Pool to Upoto, a distance of 6,000 miles,\n    they knew every landing-place on the river banks. All the ups and\n    downs of savage life, all the profits and losses derived from barter,\n    all the diplomatic arts used by tactful savages, were as well known to\n    them as the Roman alphabet to us.... No wonder that all this\n    commercial knowledge had left its traces on their faces; indeed, it is\n    the same as in your own cities in Europe. Know you not the military\n    man among you, the lawyer and the merchant, the banker, the artist, or\n    the poet? It is the same in Africa, MORE ESPECIALLY ON THE CONGO,\n    WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE SO DEVOTED TO TRADE.\"\n\n    \"During the few days of our mutual intercourse they gave us a high\n    idea of their qualities--industry, after their own style, not being\n    the least conspicuous.\"\n\n    \"As in the old time, Umangi, from the right bank, and Mpa, from the\n    left bank, despatched their representatives with ivory tusks, large\n    and small, goats and sheep, and vegetable food, clamorously demanding\n    that we should buy from them. Such urgent entreaties, accompanied with\n    blandishments to purchase their stock, were difficult to resist.\"\n\n    \"I speak of eager native traders following us for miles for the\n    smallest piece of cloth. I mention that after travelling many miles to\n    obtain cloth for ivory and redwood powder, the despairing natives\n    asked: 'Well, what is it you do want? Tell us, and we will get it for\n    you.'\"\n\nSpeaking of English scepticism as to King Leopold's intentions, he says:\n\n    \"Though they understand the satisfaction of a sentiment when applied\n    to England, they are slow to understand that it may be a sentiment\n    that induced King Leopold II. to father this International\n    Association. He is a dreamer, like his _confr\u00c3\u00a8res_ in the work,\n    because the sentiment is applied to the neglected millions of the Dark\n    Continent. They cannot appreciate rightly, because there are no\n    dividends attaching to it, this ardent, vivifying and expansive\n    sentiment, which seeks to extend civilizing influences among the dark\n    races, and to brighten up with the glow of civilization the dark\n    places of sad-browed Africa.\"\n\nOne cannot let these extracts pass without noting that Bolobo, the first\nplace named by Stanley, has sunk in population from 40,000 to 7,000; that\nIrebu, called by Stanley the populous Venice of the Congo, had in 1903 a\npopulation of fifty; that the natives who used to follow Stanley,\nbeseeching him to trade, now, according to Consul Casement, fly into the\nbush at the approach of a steamer, and that the unselfish sentiment of\nKing Leopold II. has developed into dividends of 300 per cent. per annum.\nSuch is the difference between Stanley's anticipation and the actual\nfulfilment.\n\nUntroubled, however, with any vision as to the destructive effects of his\nown work, Stanley laboured hard among the native chiefs, and returned to\nhis employer with no less than 450 alleged treaties which transferred land\nto the Association. We have no record of the exact payment made in order\nto obtain these treaties, but we have the terms of a similar transaction\ncarried out by a Belgian officer in 1883 at Palabala. In this case the\npayment made to the Chief consisted of \"one coat of red cloth with gold\nfacings, one red cap, one white tunic, one piece of white baft, one piece\nof red points, one box of liqueurs, four demijohns of rum, two boxes of\ngin, 128 bottles of gin, twenty red handkerchiefs, forty singlets and\nforty old cotton caps.\" It is clear that in making such treaties the Chief\nthought that he was giving permission for the establishment of a station.\nThe idea that he was actually bartering away the land was never even in\nhis mind, for it was held by a communal tenure for the whole tribe, and it\nwas not his to barter. And yet it is on the strength of such treaties as\nthese that twenty millions of people have been expropriated, and the whole\nwealth and land of the country proclaimed to belong, not to the\ninhabitants, but to the State--that is, to King Leopold.\n\nWith this sheaf of treaties in his portfolio the King of the Belgians now\napproached the Powers with high sentiments of humanitarianism, and with a\ndefinite request that the State which he was forming should receive some\nrecognized status among the nations. Was he at that time consciously\nhypocritical? Did he already foresee how widely his future actions would\ndiffer from his present professions? It is a problem which will interest\nthe historian of the future, who may have more materials than we upon\nwhich to form a judgment. On the one hand, there was a furtive secrecy\nabout the evolution of his plans and the despatch of his expeditions which\nshould have no place in a philanthropic enterprise. On the other hand,\nthere are limits to human powers of deception, and it is almost\ninconceivable that a man who was acting a part could so completely deceive\nthe whole civilized world. It is more probable, as it seems to me, that\nhis ambitious mind discerned that it was possible for him to acquire a\nfield of action which his small kingdom could not give, in mixing himself\nwith the affairs of Africa. He chose the obvious path, that of a\ncivilizing and elevating mission, taking the line of least resistance\nwithout any definite idea whither it might lead him. Once faced with the\nfacts, his astute brain perceived the great material possibilities of the\ncountry; his early dreams faded away to be replaced by unscrupulous\ncupidity, and step by step he was led downward until he, the man of holy\naspirations in 1885, stands now in 1909 with such a cloud of terrible\ndirect personal responsibility resting upon him as no man in modern\nEuropean history has had to bear.\n\nIt is, indeed, ludicrous, with our knowledge of the outcome, to read the\ndeclarations of the King and of his representatives at that time. They\nwere actually forming the strictest of commercial monopolies--an\norganization which was destined to crush out all general private trade in\na country as large as the whole of Europe with Russia omitted. That was\nthe admitted outcome of their enterprise. Now listen to M. Beernaert, the\nBelgian Premier, speaking in the year 1885:\n\n    \"The State, of which our King will be the Sovereign, will be a sort of\n    international Colony. There will be no monopolies, no privileges....\n    Quite the contrary: absolute freedom of commerce, freedom of property,\n    freedom of navigation.\"\n\nHere, too, are the words of Baron Lambermont, the Belgian Plenipotentiary\nat the Berlin Conference:\n\n    \"The temptation to impose abusive taxes will find its corrective, if\n    need be, in the freedom of commerce.... No doubt exists as to the\n    strict and literal meaning of the term 'in commercial matters.' It\n    means ... the unlimited right for every one to buy and to sell.\"\n\nThe question of humanity is so pressing that it obscures that of the\nbroken pledges about trade, but on the latter alone there is ample reason\nto say that every condition upon which this State was founded has been\nopenly and notoriously violated, and that, therefore, its title-deeds are\nvitiated from the beginning.\n\nAt the time the professions of the King made the whole world his\nenthusiastic allies. The United States was the first to hasten to give\nformal recognition to the new State. May it be the first, also, to realize\nthe truth and to take public steps to retract what it has done. The\nchurches and the Chambers of Commerce of Great Britain were all for\nLeopold, the one attracted by the prospect of pushing their missions into\nthe heart of Africa, the others delighted at the offer of an open market\nfor their produce. At the Congress of Berlin, which was called to regulate\nthe situation, the nations vied with each other in furthering the plans of\nthe King of the Belgians and in extolling his high aims. The Congo Free\nState was created amid general rejoicings. The veteran Bismarck, as\ncredulous as the others, pronounced its baptismal blessing. \"The New Congo\nState is called upon,\" said he, \"to become one of the chief promoters of\nthe work\" (of civilization) \"which we have in view, and I pray for its\nprosperous development and for the fulfilment of the noble aspirations of\nits illustrious founder.\" Such was the birth of the Congo Free State. Had\nthe nations gathered round been able to perceive its future, the betrayal\nof religion and civilization of which it would be guilty, the immense\nseries of crimes which it would perpetrate throughout Central Africa, the\nlowering of the prestige of all the white races, they would surely have\nstrangled the monster in its cradle.\n\nIt is not necessary to record in this statement the whole of the\nprovisions of the Berlin Congress. Two only will suffice, as they are at\nthe same time the most important and the most flagrantly abused. The first\nof these (which forms the fifth article of the agreement) proclaims that\n\"No Power which exercises sovereign rights in the said regions shall be\nallowed to grant therein either monopoly or privilege of any kind in\ncommercial matters.\" No words could be clearer than that, but the Belgian\nrepresentatives, conscious that such a clause must disarm all opposition,\nwent out of their way to accentuate it. \"No privileged situation can be\ncreated in this respect,\" they said. \"The way remains open without any\nrestriction to free competition in the sphere of commerce.\" It would be\ninteresting now to send a British or German trading expedition up the\nCongo in search of that free competition which has been so explicitly\npromised, and to see how it would fare between the monopolist Government\nand the monopolist companies who have divided the land between them. We\nhave travelled some distance since Prince Bismarck at the last sitting of\nthe Conference declared that the result was \"to secure to the commerce of\nall nations free access to the centre of the African Continent.\"\n\nMore important, however, is Article VI., both on account of the issues at\nstake, and because the signatories of the treaty bound themselves\nsolemnly, \"in the name of Almighty God,\" to watch over its enforcement. It\nran: \"All the Powers exercising sovereign rights or influence in these\nterritories pledge themselves to watch over the preservation of the native\npopulations and the improvement of their moral and material conditions of\nexistence, and to work together for the suppression of slavery and of the\nslave trade.\" That was the pledge of the united nations of Europe. It is a\ndisgrace to each of them, including ourselves, the way in which they have\nfulfilled that oath. Before their eyes, as I shall show in the sequel,\nthey have had enacted one long, horrible tragedy, vouched for by priests\nand missionaries, traders, travellers and consuls, all corroborated, but\nin no way reformed, by a Belgium commission of inquiry. They have seen\nthese unhappy people, who were their wards, robbed of all they possessed,\ndebauched, degraded, mutilated, tortured, murdered, all on such a scale as\nhas never, to my knowledge, occurred before in the whole course of\nhistory, and now, after all these years, with all the facts notorious, we\nare still at the stage of polite diplomatic expostulations. It is no\nanswer to say that France and Germany have shown even less regard for the\npledge they took at Berlin. An individual does not condone the fact that\nhe has broken his word by pointing out that his neighbour has done the\nsame.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONGO STATE\n\n\nHaving received his mandate from the civilized world King Leopold\nproceeded to organize the Government of the new State, which was in theory\nto be independent of Belgium, although ruled by the same individual. In\nEurope, King Leopold was a constitutional monarch; in Africa, an absolute\nautocrat. There were chosen three ministers for the new State--for foreign\naffairs, for finances and for internal affairs; but it cannot be too\nclearly understood that they and their successors, up to 1908, were\nnominated by the King, paid by the King, answerable only to the King, and,\nin all ways, simply so many upper clerks in his employ. The workings of\none policy and of one brain, as capable as it is sinister, are to be\ntraced in every fresh development. If the ministers were ever meant to be\na screen, it is a screen which is absolutely transparent. The origin of\neverything is the King--always the King. M. van Ectvelde, one of the three\nhead agents, put the matter into a single sentence: \"C'est \u00c3\u00a0 votre majest\u00c3\u00a9\nqu'appartient l'\u00c3\u0089tat.\" They were simply stewards, who managed the estate\nwith a very alert and observant owner at their back.\n\nOne of the early acts was enough to make observers a little thoughtful. It\nwas the announcement of the right to issue laws by arbitrary decrees\nwithout publishing them in Europe. There should be secret laws, which\ncould, at any instant, be altered. The _Bulletin Officiel_ announced that\n\"Tous les Actes du Gouvernement qu'il y a int\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00aat \u00c3\u00a0 rendre publics seront\nins\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a9s au _Bulletin Officiel_.\" Already it is clear that something was in\nthe wind which might shock the rather leathery conscience of a European\nConcert. Meanwhile, the organization of the State went forward. A\nGovernor-General was elected, who should live at Boma, which was made the\ncapital. Under him were fifteen District Commissaries, who should govern\nso many districts into which the whole country was divided. The only\nportion which was at that time at all developed was the semi-civilized\nLower Congo at the mouth of the river. There lay the white population. The\nupper reaches of the stream and of its great tributaries were known only\nto a few devoted missionaries and enterprising explorers. Grenfell and\nBentley, of the Missions, with Von Wissman, the German, and the\never-energetic Stanley, were the pioneers who, during the few years which\nfollowed, opened up the great hinterland which was to be the scene of such\natrocious events.\n\nBut the work of the explorer had soon to be supplemented and extended by\nthe soldier. Whilst the Belgians had been entering the Congo land from the\nwest, the slave-dealing Arabs had penetrated from the east, passing down\nthe river as far as Stanley Falls. There could be no compromise between\nsuch opposite forces, though some attempt was made to find one by electing\nthe Arab leader as Free State Governor. There followed a long scrambling\ncampaign, carried on for many years between the Arab slavers on the one\nside and the Congo forces upon the other--the latter consisting largely of\ncannibal tribes--men of the Stone Age, armed with the weapons of the\nnineteenth century. The suppression of the slave trade is a good cause,\nbut the means by which it was effected, and the use of Barbarians who ate\nin the evening those whom they had slain during the day, are as bad as the\nevil itself. Yet there is no denying the energy and ability of the Congo\nleaders, especially of Baron Dhanis. By the year 1894 the Belgian\nexpeditions had been pushed as far as Lake Tanganyika, the Arab\nstrongholds had fallen, and Dhanis was able to report to Brussels that the\ncampaign was at an end, and that slave-raiding was no more. The new State\ncould claim that they had saved a part of the natives from slavery. How\nthey proceeded to impose upon all of them a yoke, compared to which the\nold slavery was merciful, will be shown in these pages. From the time of\nthe fall of the Arab power the Congo Free State was only called upon to\nuse military force in the case of mutinies of its own black troops, and of\noccasional risings of its own tormented \"citizens.\" Master of its own\nhouse, it could settle down to exploit the country which it had won.\n\nIn the meantime the internal policy of the State showed a tendency to take\nan unusual and sinister course. I have already expressed my opinion that\nKing Leopold was not guilty of conscious hypocrisy in the beginning, that\nhis intentions were vaguely philanthropic, and that it was only by degrees\nthat he sank to the depths which will be shown. This view is borne out by\nsome of the earlier edicts of the State. In 1886, a long pronouncement\nupon native lands ended by the words: \"All acts or agreements are\nforbidden which tend to the expulsion of natives from the territory they\noccupy, or to deprive them, directly or indirectly, of their liberty or\ntheir means of existence.\" Such are the words of 1886. Before the end of\n1887, an Act had been published, though not immediately put into force,\nwhich had the exactly opposite effect. By this Act all lands which were\nnot actually occupied by natives were proclaimed to be the property of the\nState. Consider for a moment what this meant! No land in such a country is\nactually occupied by natives save the actual site of their villages, and\nthe scanty fields of grain or manioc which surround them. Everywhere\nbeyond these tiny patches extend the plains and forests which have been\nthe ancestral wandering places of the natives, and which contain the\nrubber, the camwood, the copal, the ivory, and the skins which are the\nsole objects of their commerce. At a single stroke of a pen in Brussels\neverything was taken from them, not only the country, but the produce of\nthe country. How could they trade when the State had taken from them\neverything which they had to offer? How could the foreign merchant do\nbusiness when the State had seized everything and could sell it for itself\ndirect in Europe? Thus, within two years of the establishment of the State\nby the Treaty of Berlin, it had with one hand seized the whole patrimony\nof those natives for whose \"moral and material advantage\" it had been so\nsolicitous, and with the other hand it had torn up that clause in the\ntreaty by which monopolies were forbidden, and equal trade rights\nguaranteed to all. How blind were the Powers not to see what sort of a\ncreature they had made, and how short-sighted not to take urgent steps in\nthose early days to make it retrace its steps and find once more the path\nof loyalty and justice! A firm word, a stern act at that time in the\npresence of this flagrant breach of international agreement, would have\nsaved all Central Africa from the horror which has come upon it, would\nhave screened Belgium from a lasting disgrace, and would have spared\nEurope a question which has already, as it seems to me, lowered the moral\nstanding of all the nations, and the end of which is not yet.\n\nHaving obtained possession of the land and its products, the next step was\nto obtain labour by which these products could be safely garnered. The\nfirst definite move in this direction was taken in the year 1888, when,\nwith that odious hypocrisy which has been the last touch in so many of\nthese transactions, an Act was produced which was described in the\n_Bulletin Officiel_ as being for the \"Special protection of the black.\" It\nis evident that the real protection of the black in matters of trade was\nto offer him such pay as would induce him to do a day's work, and to let\nhim choose his own employment, as is done with the Kaffirs of South\nAfrica, or any other native population. This Act had a very different end.\nIt allowed blacks to be bound over in terms of seven years' service to\ntheir masters in a manner which was in truth indistinguishable from\nslavery. As the negotiations were usually carried on with the capita, or\nheadman, the unfortunate servant was transferred with small profit to\nhimself, and little knowledge of the conditions of his servitude. Under\nthe same system the State also enlisted its employees, including the\nrecruits for its small army. This army was supplemented by a wild militia,\nconsisting of various barbarous tribes, many of them cannibals, and all of\nthem capable of any excess of cruelty or outrage. A German, August\nBoshart, in his \"Zehn Jahre Afrikanischen Lebens,\" has given us a clear\nidea of how these tribes are recruited, and of the precise meaning of the\nattractive word \"lib\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a9\" when applied to a State servant. \"Some District\nCommissary,\" he says, \"receives instructions to furnish a certain number\nof men in a given time. He puts himself in communication with the chiefs,\nand invites them to a palaver at his residence. These chiefs, as a rule,\nalready have an inkling of what is coming, and, if made wise by\nexperience, make a virtue of necessity and present themselves. In that\ncase the negotiations run their course easily enough; each chief promises\nto supply a certain number of slaves, and receives presents in return. It\nmay happen, however, that one or another pays no heed to the friendly\ninvitation, in which case war is declared, his villages are burned down,\nperhaps some of his people are shot, and his stores or gardens are\nplundered. In this way the wild king is soon tamed, and he sues for peace,\nwhich, of course, is granted on condition of his supplying double the\nnumber of slaves. These men are entered in the State books as 'lib\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a9s.'\nTo prevent their running away, they are put in irons and sent, on the\nfirst opportunity, to one of the military camps, where their irons are\ntaken off and they are drafted into the army. The District Commissary is\npaid \u00c2\u00a32 sterling for every serviceable recruit.\"\n\nHaving taken the country and secured labour for exploiting it in the way\ndescribed, King Leopold proceeded to take further steps for its\ndevelopment, all of them exceedingly well devised for the object in view.\nThe great impediment to the navigation of the Congo had lain in the\ncontinuous rapids which made the river impassable from Stanley Pool for\nthree hundred miles down to Boma at the mouth. A company was now formed to\nfind the capital by which a railway should be built between these two\npoints. The construction was begun in 1888, and was completed in 1898,\nafter many financial vicissitudes, forming a work which deserves high\ncredit as a piece of ingenious engineering and of sustained energy. Other\ncommercial companies, of which more will be said hereafter, were formed in\norder to exploit large districts of the country which the State was not\nyet strong enough to handle. By this arrangement the companies found the\ncapital for exploring, station building, etc., while the State--that is,\nthe King--retained a certain portion, usually half, of the company's\nshares. The plan itself is not necessarily a vicious one; indeed, it\nclosely resembles that under which the Chartered Company of Rhodesia\ngrants mining and other leases. The scandal arose from the methods by\nwhich these companies proceeded to carry out their ends--those methods\nbeing the same as were used by the State, on whose pattern these smaller\norganizations were moulded.\n\nIn the meantime King Leopold, feeling the weakness of his personal\nposition in face of the great enterprise which lay before him in Africa,\nendeavoured more and more to draw Belgium, as a State, into the matter.\nAlready the Congo State was largely the outcome of Belgian work and of\nBelgian money, but, theoretically, there was no connection between the two\ncountries. Now the Belgian Parliament was won over to advancing ten\nmillion francs for the use of the Congo, and thus a direct connection\nsprang up which has eventually led to annexation. At the time of this loan\nKing Leopold let it be known that he had left the Congo Free State in his\nwill to Belgium. In this document appear the words, \"A young and spacious\nState, directed from Brussels, has pacifically appeared in the sunlight,\nthanks to the benevolent support of the Powers that have welcomed its\nappearance. Some Belgians administer it, while others, each day more\nnumerous, there increase their wealth.\" So he flashed the gold before the\neyes of his European subjects. Verily, if King Leopold deceived other\nPowers, he reserved the most dangerous of all his deceits for his own\ncountry. The day on which they turned from their own honest, healthy\ndevelopment to follow the Congo lure, and to administer without any\nprevious colonial experience a country more than sixty times their own\nsize, will prove to have been a dark day in Belgian history.\n\nThe Berlin Conference of 1885 marks the first International session upon\nthe affairs of the Congo. The second was the Brussels Conference of\n1889-90. It is amazing to find that after these years of experience the\nPowers were still ready to accept King Leopold's professions at their face\nvalue. It is true that none of the more sinister developments had been\nconspicuous, but the legislation of the State with regard to labour and\ntrade was already such as to suggest the turn which affairs would take in\nfuture if not curbed by a strong hand. One Power, and one only, Holland,\nhad the sagacity to appreciate the true situation, and the independence to\nshow its dissatisfaction. The outcome of the sittings was various\nphilanthropic resolutions intended to strengthen the new State in dealing\nwith that slave trade it was destined to re-introduce in its most odious\nform. We are too near to these events, and they are too painfully\nintimate, to permit us to see humour in them; but the historian of the\nfuture, when he reads that the object of the European Concert was \"to\nprotect effectually the aboriginal inhabitants of Africa,\" may find it\ndifficult to suppress a smile. This was the last European assembly to deal\nwith the affairs of the Congo. May the next be for the purpose of taking\nsteps to truly carry out those high ends which have been forever spoken of\nand never reduced to practice.\n\nThe most important practical outcome of the Brussels Conference was that\nthe Powers united to free the new State from those free port promises\nwhich it had made in 1885, and to permit it in future to levy ten per\ncent. upon imports. The Act was hung up for two years owing to the\nopposition of Holland, but the fact of its adoption by the other Powers,\nand the renewed mandate given to King Leopold, strengthened the position\nof the new State to such an extent that it found no difficulty in securing\na further loan from Belgium of twenty-five millions of francs, upon\ncondition that, after ten years, Belgium should have the option of taking\nover the Congo lands as a colony.\n\nIf in the years which immediately succeeded the Brussels Conference--from\n1890 to 1894--a bird's-eye view could be taken of the enormous river\nwhich, with its tributaries, forms a great twisted fan radiating over the\nwhole centre of Africa, one would mark in all directions symptoms of\nEuropean activity. At the Lower Congo one would see crowds of natives,\nimpressed for the service and guarded by black soldiers, working at the\nrailway. At Boma and at Leopoldsville, the two termini of the projected\nline, cities are rising, with stations, wharves and public buildings. In\nthe extreme southeast one would see an expedition under Stairs exploring\nand annexing the great district of Katanga, which abuts upon Northern\nRhodesia. In the furthest northeast and along the whole eastern border,\nsmall military expeditions would be disclosed, fighting against rebellious\nblacks or Arab raiders. Then, along all the lines of the rivers, posts\nwere being formed and stations established--some by the State and some by\nthe various concessionnaire companies for the development of their\ncommerce.\n\nIn the meantime, the State was tightening its grip upon the land with its\nproducts, and was working up the system which was destined to produce such\ngrim results in the near future. The independent traders were discouraged\nand stamped out, Belgium, as well as Dutch, English and French. Some of\nthe loudest protests against the new order may be taken from Belgian\nsources. Everywhere, in flagrant disregard of the Treaty of Berlin, the\nState proclaimed itself to be the sole landlord and the sole trader. In\nsome cases it worked its own so-called property, in other cases it leased\nit. Even those who had striven to help King Leopold in the earlier stages\nof his enterprise were thrown overboard. Major Parminter, himself engaged\nin trade upon the Congo, sums up the situation in 1902 as follows: \"To sum\nup, the application of the new decrees of the Government signifies this:\nthat the State considers as its private property the whole of the Congo\nBasin, excepting the sites of the natives' villages and gardens. It\ndecrees that all the products of this immense region are its private\nproperty, and it monopolizes the trade in them. As regards the primitive\nproprietors, the native tribes, they are dispossessed by a simple\ncircular; permission is graciously granted to them to collect such\nproducts, but only on condition that they bring them for sale to the State\nfor whatever the latter may be pleased to give them. As regards alien\ntraders, they are prohibited in all this territory from trading with the\nnatives.\"\n\nEverywhere there were stern orders--to the natives on the one hand, that\nthey had no right to gather the products of their own forests; to\nindependent traders on the other hand, that they were liable to punishment\nif they bought anything from the natives. In January, 1892, District\nCommissary Baert wrote: \"The native of the district of Ubangi-Welle are\nnot authorized to gather rubber. It has been notified to them that they\ncan only receive permission to do so on condition that they gather the\nproduce for the exclusive benefit of the State.\" Captain Le Marinel, a\nlittle later, is even more explicit: \"I have decided,\" he says, \"to\nenforce rigorously the rights of the State over its domain, and, in\nconsequence, cannot allow the natives to convert to their own profit, or\nto sell to others, any part of the rubber or ivory forming the fruits of\nthe domain. Traders who purchase, or attempt to purchase, such fruits of\nthis domain from the natives--which fruits the State only authorizes the\nnatives to gather subject to the condition that they are brought to\nit--render themselves, in my opinion, guilty of receiving stolen goods,\nand I shall denounce them to the judicial authorities, so that proceedings\nmay be taken against them.\" This last edict was in the Bangala district,\nbut it was followed at once by another from the more settled Equateur\ndistrict, which shows that the strict adoption of the system was\nuniversal. In May, 1892, Lieutenant Lemaire proclaims: \"Considering that\nno concession has been granted to gather rubber in the domains of the\nState within this district, (1) natives can only gather rubber on\ncondition of selling the same to the State; (2) any person or persons or\nvessels having in his or their possession, or on board, more than one\nkilogramme of rubber will have a _proc\u00c3\u00a8sverbal_ drawn up against him, or\nthem, or it; and the ship can be confiscated without prejudice to any\nsubsequent proceedings.\"\n\nThe sight of these insignificant lieutenants and captains, who are often\nnon-commissioned officers of the Belgian army, issuing proclamations which\nwere in distinct contradiction to the expressed will of all the great\nPowers of the world, might at the time have seemed ludicrous; but the\nhistory of the next seventeen years was to prove that a small malignant\nforce, driven on by greed, may prove to be more powerful than a vague\ngeneral philanthropy, strong only in good intentions and platitudes.\nDuring these years--from 1890 to 1895--whatever indignation might be felt\namong traders over the restrictions placed upon them, the only news\nreceived by the general public from the Congo Free State concerned the\nfounding of new stations, and the idea prevailed that King Leopold's\nenterprise was indeed working out upon the humanitarian lines which had\nbeen originally planned. Then, for the first time, incidents occurred\nwhich gave some glimpse of the violence and anarchy which really\nprevailed.\n\nThe first of these, so far as Great Britain is concerned, lay in the\ntreatment of natives from Sierra Leone, Lagos, and other British\nSettlements, who had been engaged by the Belgians to come to Congoland and\nhelp in railway construction and other work. Coming from the settled order\nof such a colony as Sierra Leone or Lagos, these natives complained loudly\nwhen they found themselves working side by side with impressed Congolese,\nand under the discipline of the armed sentinels of the Force Publique.\nThey were discontented and the discontent was met by corporal punishment.\nThe matter grew to the dimensions of a scandal.\n\nIn answer to a question asked in the House of Commons on March 12th, 1896,\nMr. Chamberlain, as Secretary of State for the Colonies, stated that\ncomplaints had been received of these British subjects having been\nemployed without their consent as soldiers, and of their having been\ncruelly flogged, and, in some cases, shot; and he added: \"They were\nengaged with the knowledge of Her Majesty's representatives, and every\npossible precaution was taken in their interests; but, in consequence of\nthe complaints received, the recruitment of labourers for the Congo has\nbeen prohibited.\"\n\nThis refusal of the recruitment of labourers by Great Britain was the\nfirst public and national sign of disapproval of Congolese methods. A few\nyears later, a more pointed one was given, when the Italian War Ministry\nrefused to allow their officers to serve with the Congo forces.\n\nEarly in 1895 occurred the Stokes affair, which moved public opinion\ndeeply, both in this country and in Germany. Charles Henry Stokes was an\nEnglishman by birth, but he resided in German East Africa, was the\nrecipient of a German Decoration for his services on behalf of German\ncolonization, and formed his trading caravans from a German base, with\nEast African natives as his porters. He had led such a caravan over the\nCongo State border, when he was arrested by Captain Lothaire, an officer\nin command of some Congolese troops. The unfortunate Stokes may well have\nthought himself safe as the subject of one great Power and the agent of\nanother, but he was tried instantly in a most informal manner upon a\ncharge of selling guns to the natives, was condemned, and was hanged on\nthe following morning. When Captain Lothaire reported his proceedings to\nhis superiors they signified their approbation by promoting him to the\nhigh rank of Commissaire-G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral.\n\nThe news of this tragedy excited as much indignation in Berlin as in\nLondon. Faced with the facts, the representatives of the Free State in\nBrussels--that is, the agents of the King--were compelled to admit the\ncomplete illegality of the whole incident, and could only fall back upon\nthe excuse that Lothaire's action was _bona-fide_, and free from personal\nmotive. This is by no means certain, for as Baron von Marschall pointed\nout to the acting British Ambassador at Berlin, Stokes was known to be a\nsuccessful trader in ivory, exporting it by the east route, and so\ndepriving the officers of the Congo Government of a ten per cent.\ncommission, which would be received by them if it were exported by the\nwest route. \"This was the reason,\" the report continued, quoting the\nGerman Statesman's words, \"that he had been done away with, and not on\naccount of an alleged sale of arms to Arabs, his death being, in fact, not\nan act of justice, but one of commercial protection, neither more nor\nless.\"\n\nThis was one reading of the situation. Whether it was a true one or not,\nthere could be no two opinions as to the illegality of the proceedings.\nUnder pressure from England, Lothaire was tried at Boma and acquitted. He\nwas again, under the same pressure, tried at Brussels, when the\nProsecuting Counsel thought it consistent with his duty to plead for an\nacquittal and the proceedings became a fiasco. There the matter was\nallowed to remain. A Blue Book of 188 pages is the last monument to\nCharles Henry Stokes, and his executioner returned to high office in the\nCongo Free State, where his name soon recurred in the accounts of the\nviolent and high-handed proceedings which make up the history of that\ncountry. He was appointed Director of the Antwerp Society for the Commerce\nof the Congo--an appointment for which King Leopold must have been\nresponsible--and he managed the affairs of that company until he was\nimplicated in the Mongalla massacres, of which more will be said\nhereafter.\n\nIt has been necessary to describe the case of Stokes, because it is\nhistorical, but nothing is further from my intention than to address\nnational _amour propre_ in the matter. It was a mere accident that Stokes\nwas an Englishman, and the outrage remains the same had he been a citizen\nof any State. The cause I plead is too broad, and also too lofty, to be\nsupported by any narrower appeals than those which may be addressed to all\nhumanity. I will proceed to describe a case which occurred a few years\nlater to show that men of other nationalities suffered as well as the\nEnglish. Stokes, the Englishman, was killed, and his death, it was said by\nsome Congolese apologists, was due to his not having, after his summary\ntrial, announced that he would lodge an immediate appeal to the higher\ncourt at Boma. Rabinck, the Austrian, the victim of similar proceedings,\ndid appeal to the higher court at Boma, and it is interesting to see what\nadvantage he gained by doing so.\n\nRabinck was, as I have said, an Austrian from Olmutz, a man of a gentle\nand lovable nature, popular with all who knew him, and remarkable, as\nseveral have testified, for his just and kindly treatment of the natives.\nHe had, for some years, traded with the people of Katanga, which is the\nsoutheastern portion of the Congo State where it abuts upon British\nCentral Africa. The natives were at the time in arms against the Belgians,\nbut Rabinck had acquired such influence among them that he was still able\nto carry on his trade in ivory and rubber for which he held a permit from\nthe Katanga Company.\n\nShortly after receiving this permit, for which he had paid a considerable\nsum, certain changes were made in the company by which the State secured a\ncontrolling influence in it. A new manager, Major Weyns, appeared, who\nrepresented the new r\u00c3\u00a9gime, superseding M. L\u00c3\u00a9v\u00c3\u00aaque, who had sold the\npermits in the name of the original company. Major Weyns was zealous that\nthe whole trade of the country should belong to the Concessionnaire\nCompany, which was practically the Government, according to the usual, but\ninternationally illegal, habit of the State. To secure this trade, the\nfirst step was evidently to destroy so well-known and successful a private\ntrader as M. Rabinck. In spite of his permits, therefore, a charge was\ntrumped up against him of having traded illegally in rubber--an offence\nwhich, even if he had no permit, was an impossibility in the face of that\ncomplete freedom of trade which was guaranteed by the Treaty of Berlin.\nThe young Austrian could not bring himself to believe that the matter was\nserious. His letters are extant, showing that he regarded the matter as so\npreposterous that he could not feel any fears upon the subject. He was\nsoon to be undeceived, and his eyes were opened too late to the character\nof the men and the organization with which he was dealing. Major Weyns sat\nin court-martial upon him. The offence with which he was charged, dealing\nillegally in rubber, was one which could only be punished by a maximum\nimprisonment of a month. This would not serve the purpose in view. Major\nWeyns within forty minutes tried the case, condemned the prisoner, and\nsentenced him to a year's imprisonment. There was an attempt to excuse\nthis monstrous sentence afterward by the assertion that the crime\npunished was that of selling guns to the natives, but as a matter of fact\nthere was at the time no mention of anything of the sort, as is proved by\nthe existing minutes of the trial. Rabinck naturally appealed against such\na sentence. He would have been wiser had he submitted to it in the nearest\nguard-house. In that case he might possibly have escaped with his life. In\nthe other, he was doomed. \"He will go,\" said Major Weyns, \"on such a nice\nlittle voyage that he will act like this no more, and others will take\nexample from it.\" The voyage in question was the two thousand miles which\nseparated Katanga from the Appeal Court at Boma. He was to travel all this\nway under the sole escort of black soldiers, who had their own\ninstructions. The unfortunate man felt that he could never reach his\ndestination alive. \"Rumours have it,\" he wrote to his relatives, \"that\nEuropeans who have been taken are poisoned, so if I disappear without\nfurther news you may guess what has become of me.\" Nothing more was heard\nfrom him save two agonized letters, begging officials to speed him on his\nway. He died, as he had foreseen, on the trip down the Congo, and was\nhurriedly buried in a wayside station when two hours more would have\nbrought the body to Leopoldville. If it is possible to add a darker shadow\nto the black business it lies in the fact that the apologists of the State\nendeavoured to make the world believe that their victim's death was due to\nhis own habit of taking morphia. The fact is denied by four creditable\nwitnesses, who knew him well, but most of all is it denied by the activity\nand energy which had made him one of the leading traders of Central\nAfrica--too good a trader to be allowed open competition with King\nLeopold's huge commercial monopoly. As a last and almost inconceivable\ntouch, the whole of the dead man's caravans and outfits, amounting to some\n\u00c2\u00a315,000, were seized by those who had driven him to his death, and by the\nlast reports neither his relatives nor his creditors have received any\nportion of this large sum. Consider the whole story and say if it is\nexaggeration to state that Gustav Maria Rabinck was robbed and murdered by\nthe Congo Free State.\n\nHaving shown in these two examples the way in which the Congo Free State\nhas dared to treat the citizens of European States who have traded within\nher borders, I will now proceed to detail, in chronological order, some\naccount of the dark story of that State's relations to the subject races,\nfor whose moral and material advantage we and other European Powers have\nanswered. For every case I chronicle there are a hundred which are known,\nbut which cannot here be dealt with. For every one known, there are ten\nthousand, the story of which never came to Europe. Consider how vast is\nthe country, and how few the missionaries or consuls who alone would\nreport such matters. Consider also that every official of the Congo State\nis sworn neither at the time nor _afterward_ to reveal any matter that may\nhave come to his knowledge. Consider, lastly, that the missionary or\nconsul acts as a deterrent, and that it is in the huge stretch of country\nwhere neither are to be found that the agent has his own unfettered way.\nWith all these considerations, is it not clear that all the terrible facts\nwhich we know are but the mere margin of that welter of violence and\ninjustice which the Jesuit, Father Vermeersch, has summed up in the two\nwords, \"Immeasurable Misery!\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nTHE WORKING OF THE SYSTEM\n\n\nHaving claimed, as I have shown, the whole of the land, and therefore the\nwhole of its products, the State--that is, the King--proceeded to\nconstruct a system by which these products could be gathered most rapidly\nand at least cost. The essence of this system was that the people who had\nbeen dispossessed (ironically called \"citizens\") were to be forced to\ngather, for the profit of the State, those very products which had been\ntaken from them. This was to be effected by two means; the one, taxation,\nby which an arbitrary amount, ever growing larger until it consumed almost\ntheir whole lives in the gathering, should be claimed for nothing. The\nother, so-called barter by which the natives were paid for the stuff\nexactly what the State chose to give, and in the form the State chose to\ngive it, there being no competition allowed from any other purchaser. This\nremuneration, ridiculous in value, took the most absurd shape, the natives\nbeing compelled to take it, whatever the amount, and however little they\nmight desire it. Consul Thesiger, in 1908, describing their so-called\nbarter, says: \"The goods he proceeds to distribute, giving a hat to one\nman, or an iron hoe-head to another, and so on. Each recipient is then at\nthe end of a month responsible for so many balls of rubber. No choice of\nthe objects is given, no refusal is allowed. If any one makes any\nobjection, the stuff is thrown down at his door, and whether it is taken\nor left, the man is responsible for so many balls at the end of the month.\nThe total amounts are fixed by the agents at the maximum which the\ninhabitants are capable of producing.\"\n\nBut is it not clear that no natives, especially tribes who, as Stanley has\nrecorded, had remarkable aptitude for trade, would do business at all upon\nsuch terms? That is just where the system came in.\n\nBy this system some two thousand white agents were scattered over the Free\nState to collect the produce. These whites were placed in ones and twos\nin the more central points, and each was given a tract of country\ncontaining a certain number of villages. By the help of the inmates he was\nto gather the rubber, which was the most valuable asset. These whites,\nmany of whom were men of low _morale_ before they left Europe, were\nwretchedly paid, the scale running from 150 to 300 francs a month. This\npay they might supplement by a commission or bonus on the amount of rubber\ncollected. If their returns were large it meant increased pay, official\npraise, a more speedy return to Europe, and a better chance of promotion.\nIf, on the other hand, the returns were small, it meant poverty, harsh\nreproof and degradation. No system could be devised by which a body of men\ncould be so driven to attain results at any cost. It is not to the\nabsolute discredit of Belgians that such an existence should have\ndemoralized them, and, indeed, there were other nationalities besides\nBelgians in the ranks of the agents. I doubt if Englishmen, Americans, or\nGermans could have escaped the same result had they been exposed in a\ntropical country to similar temptations.\n\nAnd now, the two thousand agents being in place, and eager to enforce the\ncollection of rubber upon very unwilling natives, how did the system\nintend that they should set about it? The method was as efficient as it\nwas absolutely diabolical. Each agent was given control over a certain\nnumber of savages, drawn from the wild tribes, but armed with firearms.\nOne or more of these was placed in each village to ensure that the\nvillagers should do their task. These are the men who are called\n\"capitas,\" or head-men in the accounts, and who are the actual, though not\nthe moral, perpetrators of so many horrible deeds. Imagine the nightmare\nwhich lay upon each village while this barbarian squatted in the midst of\nit. Day or night they could never get away from him. He called for palm\nwine. He called for women. He beat them, mutilated them, and shot them\ndown at his pleasure. He enforced public incest in order to amuse himself\nby the sight. Sometimes they plucked up spirit and killed him. The Belgian\nCommission records that 142 capitas had been killed in seven months in a\nsingle district. Then came the punitive expedition, and the destruction of\nthe whole community. The more terror the capita inspired, the more useful\nhe was, the more eagerly the villagers obeyed him, and the more rubber\nyielded its commission to the agent. When the amount fell off, then the\ncapita was himself made to feel some of those physical pains which he had\ninflicted upon others. Often the white agent far exceeded in cruelty the\nbarbarian who carried out his commissions. Often, too, the white man\npushed the black aside, and acted himself as torturer and executioner. As\na rule, however, the relationship was as I have stated, the outrages being\nactually committed by the capitas, but with the approval of, and often in\nthe presence of, their white employers.\n\nIt would be absurd to suppose that the agents were all equally merciless,\nand that there were not some who were torn in two by the desire for wealth\nand promotion on the one side and the horror of their daily task upon the\nother. Here are two illustrative extracts from the letters of Lieutenant\nTilkens, as quoted by Mr. Vandervelde in the debate in the Belgian\nChamber: \"The steamer _v. d. Kerkhove_ is coming up the Nile. It will\nrequire the colossal number of fifteen hundred porters--unhappy blacks! I\ncannot think of them. I ask myself how I shall find such a number. If the\nroads were passable it would make some difference, but they are hardly\ncleared of morasses where many will meet their death. Hunger and weariness\nwill make an end of many more in the eight days' march. How much blood\nwill the transport make to flow? Already I have had to make war three\ntimes against the chieftains who will not take part in this work. The\npeople prefer to die in the forest instead of doing this work. If a\nchieftain refuses, it is war, and this horrible war--perfect firearms\nagainst spear and lance. A chieftain has just left me with the complaint:\n'My village is in ruins, my women are killed.' But what can I do? I am\noften compelled to put these unhappy chieftains into chains until they\ncollect one or two hundred porters. Very often my soldiers find the\nvillages empty, then they seize the women and children.\"\n\nTo his mother he writes:\n\n    \"Com. Verstraeten visited my station and highly congratulated me. He\n    said the attitude of his report hung upon the quantity of rubber I\n    would bring. My quantity rose from 360 kilos in September to 1,500 in\n    October, and from January it will be 4,000 per month, which gives me\n    500 francs over my pay. Am I not a lucky fellow? And if I continue, in\n    two years I shall have reached an additional 12,000 francs.\"\n\nBut a year later he writes in a different tone to Major Leussens:\n\n    \"I look forward to a general rising. I warned you before, I think,\n    already in my last letter. The cause is always the same. The natives\n    are weary of the hitherto _r\u00c3\u00a9gime_--transport labour, collection of\n    rubber, preparation of food stores for blacks and whites. Again for\n    three months I have had to fight with only ten days' rest. I have 152\n    prisoners. For two years now I have been carrying on war in this\n    neighbourhood. But I cannot say I have subjected the people. They\n    prefer to die. What can I do? I am paid to do my work, I am a tool in\n    the hands of my superiors, and I follow orders as discipline\n    requires.\"\n\nLet us consider now for an instant the chain of events which render such a\nsituation not only possible, but inevitable. The State is run with the one\nobject of producing revenue. For this end all land and its produce are\nappropriated. How, then, is this produce to be gathered? It can only be by\nthe natives. But if the natives gather it they must be paid their price,\nwhich will diminish profits, or else they will refuse to work. Then they\nmust be made to work. But the agents are too few to make them work. Then\nthey must employ such sub-agents as will strike most terror into the\npeople. But if these sub-agents are to make the people work all the time,\nthen they must themselves reside in the villages. So a capita must be sent\nas a constant terror to each village. Is it not clear that these steps are\nnot accidental, but are absolutely essential to the original idea? Given\nthe confiscation of the land, all the rest must logically follow. It is\nutterly futile, therefore, to imagine that any reform can set matters\nright. Such a thing is impossible. Until unfettered trade is\nunconditionally restored, as it now exists in every German and English\ncolony, it is absolutely out of the question that any specious promises or\nwritten decrees can modify the situation. But, on the other hand, if trade\nbe put upon this natural basis, then for many years the present owners of\nthe Congo land, instead of sharing dividends, must pay out at least a\nmillion a year to administer the country, exactly as England pays half a\nmillion a year to administer the neighbouring land of Nigeria. To grasp\nthat fact is to understand the root of the whole question.\n\nAnd one more point before we proceed to the dark catalogue of the facts.\nWhere did the responsibility for these deeds of blood, these thousands of\ncold-blooded murders lie? Was it with the capita?\n\nHe was a cannibal and a ruffian, but if he did not inspire terror in the\nvillage he was himself punished by the agent. Was it, then, with the\nagent? He was a degraded man, and yet, as I have already said, no men\ncould serve on such terms in a tropical country without degradation. He\nwas goaded and driven to crime by the constant clamour from those above\nhim. Was it, then, with the District Commissary? He had reached a\nresponsible and well-paid post, which he would lose if his particular\ndistrict fell behind in the race of production. Was it, then, with the\nGovernor-General at Boma? He was a man of a hardened conscience, but for\nhim also there was mitigation. He was there for a purpose with definite\norders from home which it was his duty to carry through. It would take a\nman of exceptional character to throw up his high position, sacrifice his\ncareer, and refuse to carry out the evil system which had been planned\nbefore he was allotted a place in it. Where, then, was the guilt? There\nwere half a dozen officials in Brussels who were, as shown already, so\nmany bailiffs paid to manage a property upon lines laid down for them.\nTrace back the chain from the red-handed savage, through the worried,\nbilious agent, the pompous Commissary, the dignified Governor-General, the\nsmooth diplomatist, and you come finally, without a break, and without a\npossibility of mitigation or excuse, up the cold, scheming brain which\nframed and drove the whole machine. It is upon the King, always the King,\nthat the guilt must lie. He planned it, knowing the results which must\nfollow. They did follow. He was well informed of it. Again and again, and\nyet again, his attention was drawn to it. A word from him would have\naltered the system. The word was never said. There is no possible\nsubterfuge by which the moral guilt can be deflected from the head of the\nState, the man who went to Africa for the freedom of commerce and the\nregeneration of the native.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nFIRST FRUITS OF THE SYSTEM\n\n\nThe first testimony which I shall cite is that of Mr. Glave, which covers\nthe years 1893 up to his death in 1895. Mr. Glave was a young Englishman,\nwho had been for six years in the employ of the State, and whose character\nand work were highly commended by Stanley. Four years after the expiration\nof his engagement he travelled as an independent man right across the\nwhole country, from Tanganyika in the east to Matadi near the mouth of the\nriver, a distance of 2,000 miles. The agent and rubber systems were still\nin their infancy, but already he remarked on every side that violence and\ndisregard of human life which were so soon to grow to such proportions.\nRemember that he was himself a Stanleyman, a pioneer and a native trader,\nby no means easy to shock. Here are some of his remarks as taken from his\ndiary.\n\nDealing with the release of slaves by the Belgians, for which so much\ncredit has been claimed, he says (_Cent. Mag._, Vol. 53):\n\n    \"They are supposed to be taken out of slavery and freed, but I fail to\n    see how this can be argued out. They are taken from their villages and\n    shipped south, to be soldiers, workers, etc., on the State stations,\n    and what were peaceful families have been broken up, and the different\n    members spread about the place. They have to be made fast and guarded\n    for transportation, or they would all run away. This does not look as\n    though the freedom promised had any seductive prospects. The young\n    children thus 'liberated' are handed over to the French mission\n    stations, where they receive the kindest care, but nothing justifies\n    this form of serfdom. I can understand the State compelling natives to\n    do a certain amount of work for a certain time; but to take people\n    forcibly from their homes, and despatch them here and there, breaking\n    up families, is not right. I shall learn more about this on the way\n    and at Kabambare. If these conditions are to exist, I fail to see how\n    the anti-slavery movement is to benefit the native.\"\n\nWith regard to the use of barbarous soldiers he says:\n\n    \"State soldiers are also employed without white officers. This should\n    not be allowed, for the black soldiers do not understand the reason of\n    the fighting, and instead of submission being sought, often the\n    natives are massacred or driven away into the hill.... But the black\n    soldiers are bent on fighting and raiding; they want no peaceful\n    settlement. They have good rifles and ammunition, realize their\n    superiority over the natives with their bows and arrows, and they want\n    to shoot and kill and rob. Black delights to kill black, whether the\n    victim be man, woman, or child, and no matter how defenceless. This is\n    no reasonable way of settling the land; it is merely persecution.\n    Blacks cannot be employed on such an errand unless under the\n    leadership of whites.\"\n\nHe met and describes one Lieutenant Hambursin, who seems to have been a\ncapable officer:\n\n    \"Yesterday the natives in a neighbouring village came to complain that\n    one of Hambursin's soldiers had killed a villager; they brought in the\n    offender's gun. To-day at roll-call the soldier appeared without his\n    gun; his guilt was proved, and without more to do, he was hanged on a\n    tree. Hambursin has hanged several for the crime of murder.\"\n\nHad there been more Hambursins there might have been fewer scandals. Glave\nproceeds to comment on treatment of prisoners:\n\n    \"In stations in charge of white men, Government officers, one sees\n    strings of poor emaciated old women, some of them mere skeletons,\n    working from six in the morning till noon, and from half-past two till\n    six, carrying clay water-jars, tramping about in gangs, with a rope\n    round the neck, and connected by a rope one and a half yards apart.\n    They are prisoners of war. In war the old women are always caught, but\n    should receive a little humanity. They are naked, except for a\n    miserable patch of cloth of several parts, held in place by a string\n    round the waist. They are not loosened from the rope for any purpose.\n    They live in the guard-house under the charge of black native\n    sentries, who delight in slapping and ill-using them, for pity is not\n    in the heart of the native. Some of the women have babies, but they go\n    to work just the same. They form, indeed, a miserable spectacle, and\n    one wonders that old women, although prisoners of war, should not\n    receive a little more consideration; at least, their nakedness might\n    be hidden. The men prisoners are treated in a far better way.\"\n\nDescribing the natives he says:\n\n    \"The natives are not lazy, good-for-nothing fellows. Their fine powers\n    are obtained by hard work, sobriety and frugal living.\"\n\nHe gives a glimpse of what the chicotte is like, the favourite and\nuniversal instrument of torture used by the agents and officers of the\nFree State:\n\n    \"The 'chicotte' of raw hippo hide, especially a new one, trimmed like\n    a corkscrew, with edges like knife-blades, and as hard as wood, is a\n    terrible weapon, and a few blows bring blood; not more than\n    twenty-five blows should be given unless the offence is very serious.\n    Though we persuaded ourselves that the African's skin is very tough it\n    needs an extraordinary constitution to withstand the terrible\n    punishment of one hundred blows; generally the victim is in a state of\n    insensibility after twenty-five or thirty blows. At the first blow he\n    yells abominably; then he quiets down, and is a mere groaning,\n    quivering body till the operation is over, when the culprit stumbles\n    away, often with gashes which will endure a lifetime. It is bad enough\n    the flogging of men, but far worse is this punishment when inflicted\n    on women and children. Small boys of ten or twelve, with excitable,\n    hot-tempered masters, often are most harshly treated. At Kasnogo there\n    is a great deal of cruelty displayed. I saw two boys very badly cut. I\n    conscientiously believe that a man who receives one hundred blows is\n    often nearly killed, and has his spirit broken for life.\"\n\nHe has a glimpse of the treatment of the subjects of other nations:\n\n    \"Two days before my arrival (at Wabundu) two Sierra Leoneans were\n    hanged by Laschet. They were sentries on guard, and while they were\n    asleep allowed a native chief, who was a prisoner and in chains, to\n    escape. Next morning Laschet, in a fit of rage, hanged the two men.\n    They were British subjects, engaged by the Congo Free State as\n    soldiers. In time of war, I suppose, they could be executed, after\n    court-martial, by being shot; but to hang a subject of any other\n    country without trial seems to me outrageous.\"\n\nTalking of the general unrest he says:\n\n    \"It is the natural outcome of the harsh, cruel policy of the State in\n    wringing rubber from these people without paying for it. The\n    revolution will extend.\" He adds: \"The post (Isangi) is close to the\n    large settlement of an important coast man, Kayamba, who now is\n    devoted to the interests of the State, catching slaves for them, and\n    stealing ivory from the natives of the interior. Does the\n    philanthropic King of the Belgians know about this? If not, he ought\n    to.\"\n\nAs he gets away from the zone of war, and into that which should represent\npeace, his comments become more bitter. The nascent rubber trade began to\nintrude its methods upon his notice:\n\n    \"Formerly the natives were well treated, but now expeditions have been\n    sent in every direction, forcing natives to make rubber and to bring\n    it to the stations. Up the Ikelemba, we are taking down one hundred\n    slaves, mere children, all taken in unholy wars against the\n    natives.... It was not necessary in the olden times, when we white men\n    had no force at all. This forced commerce is depopulating the\n    country.... Left Equateur at eleven o'clock this morning, after taking\n    on a cargo of one hundred small slaves, principally boys, seven or\n    eight years old, with a few girls among the batch, all stolen from the\n    natives. The Commissary of the district is a violent-tempered fellow.\n    While arranging to take on the hundred small slaves a woman who had\n    charge of the youngsters was rather slow in understanding his order,\n    delivered in very poor Kabanji. He sprang at her, slapped her in the\n    face, and as she ran away, kicked her. They talk of philanthropy and\n    civilization! Where it is, I do not know.\"\n\nAnd again:\n\n    \"Most white officers out on the Congo are averse to the india-rubber\n    policy of the State, but the laws command it. Therefore, at each post\n    one finds the natives deserting their homes, and escaping to the\n    French side of the river when possible.\"\n\nAs he goes on his convictions grow stronger:\n\n    \"Everywhere,\" he said, \"I hear the same news of the doings of the\n    Congo Free State--rubber and murder, slavery in its worst form. It is\n    said that half the lib\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a9s sent down die on the road.... In Europe we\n    understand from the word lib\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a9s slaves saved from their cruel\n    masters. Not at all! Most of them result from wars made against the\n    natives because of ivory or rubber.\"\n\nOn all sides he sees evidence of the utter disregard of humanity:\n\n    \"To-day I saw the dead body of a carrier lying on the trail. There\n    could have been no mistake about his being a sick man; he was nothing\n    but skin and bones. These posts ought to give some care to the\n    porters; the heartless disregard for life is abominable.... Native\n    life is considered of no value by the Belgians. No wonder the State is\n    hated.\"\n\nFinally, a little before his death, he heard of that practice of\nmutilation which was one of the most marked fruits of the policy of \"moral\nand material advantage of the native races\" promised at the Berlin\nConference:\n\n    \"Mr. Harvey heard from Clarke, who is at Lake Mantumba, that the State\n    soldiers have been in the vicinity of his station recently fighting\n    and taking prisoners; and he himself had seen several men with bunches\n    of hands signifying their individual skill. These, I presume, they\n    must produce to prove their success! Among the hands were those of men\n    and women, and also those of little children. The missionaries are so\n    much at the mercy of the State that they do not report these barbaric\n    happenings to the people at home. I have previously heard of hands,\n    among them children's, being brought to the stations, but I was not so\n    satisfied of the truth of the former information as of the reports\n    received just now by Mr. Harvey from Clarke. Much of this sort of\n    thing is going on at the Equateur Station. The methods employed are\n    not necessary. Years ago, when I was on duty at the Equateur without\n    soldiers, I never had any difficulty in getting what men I needed, nor\n    did any other station in the old, humane days. The stations and the\n    boats then had no difficulty in finding men or labour, nor will the\n    Belgians, if they introduce more reasonable methods.\"\n\nA sentence which is worth noting is that \"The missionaries are so much at\nthe mercy of the State that they do not report these barbaric happenings\nto the people at home.\" Far from the question being one, which, as the\napologists for King Leopold have contended, has been fomented by the\nmissionaries, it has actually been held back by them, and it is only the\ncourage and truthfulness of a handful of Englishmen and Americans which\nhave finally brought it to the front.\n\n\nSo much for Mr. Glave's testimony. He was an English traveller. Mr.\nMurphy, an American missionary, was working in another part of the\ncountry, the region where the Ubangi joins the Congo, during the same\nyears. Let us see how far his account, written entirely independently\n(_Times_, November 18, 1895), agrees with the other:\n\n    \"I have seen these things done,\" he said, \"and have remonstrated with\n    the State in the years 1888, 1889, and 1894, but never got\n    satisfaction. I have been in the interior and have seen the ravages\n    made by the State in pursuit of this iniquitous trade. Let me give an\n    incident to show how this unrighteous trade affects the people. One\n    day a State corporal, who was in charge of the post of Solifa, was\n    going round the town collecting rubber. Meeting a poor woman, whose\n    husband was away fishing, he asked: 'Where is your husband?' She\n    answered by pointing to the river. He then asked: 'Where is his\n    rubber?' She answered: 'It is ready for you.' Whereupon he said 'You\n    lie,' and lifting up his gun, shot her dead. Shortly afterward the\n    husband returned and was told of the murder of his wife. He went\n    straight to the corporal, taking with him his rubber, and asked why he\n    had shot his wife. The wretched man then raised his gun and killed the\n    corporal. The soldiers ran away to the headquarters of the State, and\n    made representations of the case, with the result that the Commissary\n    sent a large force to support the authority of the soldiers; the town\n    was looted, burned, and many people were killed and wounded.\"\n\nAgain:\n\n    \"In November last (1894) there was heavy fighting on the Bosira,\n    because the people refused to give rubber, and I was told upon the\n    authority of a State officer that no less than eighteen hundred people\n    were killed. Upon another occasion in the same month some soldiers ran\n    away from a State steamer, and, it was said, went to the town of\n    Bombumba. The officer sent a message telling the chief of the town to\n    give them up. He answered that he could not, as the fugitives had not\n    been in his town. The officer sent the messenger a second time with\n    the order: 'Come to me at once, or war in the morning.' The next\n    morning the old chief went to meet the Belgians, and was attacked\n    without provocation. He himself was wounded, his wife was killed\n    before his eyes, and her head cut off in order that they might possess\n    the brass necklet that she wore. Twenty-four of the chief's people\n    were also killed, and all for the paltry reason given above. Again the\n    people of Lake Mantumba ran away on account of the cruelty of the\n    State, and the latter sent some soldiers in charge of a coloured\n    corporal to treat with them and induce them to return. On the way the\n    troops met a canoe containing seven of the fugitives. Under some\n    paltry pretext they made the people land, shot them, cut off their\n    hands and took them to the Commissary. The Mantumba people complained\n    to the missionary at Irebu, and he went down to see if the story was\n    true. He ascertained the case to be just as they had narrated, and\n    found that one of the seven was a little girl, who was not quite dead.\n    The child recovered, and she lives to-day, the stump of the handless\n    arm witnessing against this horrible practice. These are only a few\n    things of many that have taken place in one district.\"\n\nIt was not merely for rubber that these horrors were done. Much of the\ncountry is unsuited to rubber, and in those parts there were other imposts\nwhich were collected with equal brutality. One village had to send food\nand was remiss one day in supplying it:\n\n    \"The people were quietly sleeping in their beds when they heard a shot\n    fired, and ran out to see what was the matter. Finding the soldiers\n    had surrounded the town, their only thought was escape. As they raced\n    out of their homes, men, women and children, they were ruthlessly shot\n    down. Their town was utterly destroyed, and is a ruin to this day. The\n    only reason for this fight was that the people had failed to bring\n    Kwanga (food) to the State upon that one day.\"\n\nFinally Mr. Murphy says: \"The rubber question is accountable for most of\nthe horrors perpetrated in the Congo. It has reduced the people to a state\nof utter despair. Each town in the district is forced to bring a certain\nquantity to the headquarters of the Commissary every Sunday. It is\ncollected by force; the soldiers drive the people into the bush; if they\nwill not go they are shot down, their left hands being cut off and taken\nas trophies to the Commissary. The soldiers do not care whom they shoot\ndown, and they most often shoot poor, helpless women and harmless\nchildren. These hands--the hands of men, women and children--are placed\nin rows before the Commissary, who counts them to see the soldiers have\nnot wasted the cartridges. The Commissary is paid a commission of about a\npenny per pound upon all the rubber he gets; it is, therefore, to his\ninterest to get as much as he can.\"\n\nHere is corroboration and amplification of all that Mr. Glaves had put\nforward. The system had not been long established, and was more efficient\nten or twelve years later, but already it was bearing some notable first\nfruits of civilization. King Leopold's rule cannot be said to have left\nthe country unchanged. There is ample evidence that mutilations of this\nsort were unknown among the native savages. Knowledge was spreading under\nEuropean rule.\n\nHaving heard the testimony of an English traveller and of an American\nmissionary, let us now hear that of a Swedish clergyman, Mr. Sjoblom, as\ndetailed in _The Aborigines' Friend_, July, 1897. It covers much the same\ntime as the other two, and is drawn from the Equateur district. Here is\nthe system in full swing:\n\n    \"They refuse to bring the rubber. Then war is declared. The soldiers\n    are sent in different directions. The people in the towns are\n    attacked, and when they are running away into the forest, and try to\n    hide themselves, and save their lives, they are found out by the\n    soldiers. Then their gardens of rice are destroyed, and their supplies\n    taken. Their plantains are cut down while they are young and not in\n    fruit, and often their huts are burned, and, of course, everything of\n    value is taken. Within my own knowledge forty-five villages were\n    altogether burned down. I say altogether, because there were many\n    others partly burned down. I passed through twenty-eight abandoned\n    villages. The natives had left their places to go further inland. In\n    order to separate themselves from the white men they go part of the\n    way down the river, or else they cross the river into French\n    territory. Sometimes, the natives are obliged to pay a large\n    indemnity. The chiefs often have to pay with brass wire and slaves,\n    and if the slaves do not make up the amount their wives are sold to\n    pay. I was told that by a Belgian officer. I will give you,\" Mr.\n    Sjoblom continues, \"an instance of a man I saw shot right before my\n    eyes. In one of my inland journeys, when I had gone a little farther,\n    perhaps, than the Commissary expected me to go, I saw something that\n    perhaps he would not have liked me to see. It was at a town called\n    Ibera, one of the cannibal towns to which no white man had ever been\n    before. I reached it at sunset, after the natives had returned from\n    the various places in which they had been looking for india-rubber.\n    They gathered together in a great crowd, being curious to see a white\n    man. Besides, they had heard I had some good news to tell them, which\n    came through the Gospel. When that large crowd gathered, and I was\n    just ready to preach, the sentinels rushed in among them to seize an\n    old man. They dragged him aside a little from the crowd, and the\n    sentinel in charge came to me and said, 'I want to shoot this man,\n    because he has been in the river fishing to-day. He has not been on\n    the river for india-rubber.' I told him: 'I have not authority to stop\n    you, because I have nothing to do with these palavers, but the people\n    are here to hear what I have to say to them, and I don't want you to\n    do it before my eyes.' He said: 'All right, I will keep him in bonds,\n    then, until to-morrow morning when you have gone. Then I will kill\n    him.' But a few minutes afterward the sentinel came in a rage to the\n    man and shot him right before my eyes. Then he charged his rifle again\n    and pointed it at the others, who all rushed away like chaff before\n    the wind. He told a little boy, eight or nine years of age, to go and\n    cut off the right hand of the man who had been shot. The man was not\n    quite dead, and when he felt the knife he tried to drag his hand away.\n    The boy, after some labour, cut the hand off and laid it by a fallen\n    tree. A little later this hand was put on a fire to smoke before being\n    sent to the Commissary.\"\n\nHere we get the system at its highest. I think that picture of the child\nhacking off the hand of the dying man at the order of the monster who\nwould have assuredly murdered him also had he hesitated to obey, is as\ndiabolical a one as even the Congo could show. A pretty commentary upon\nthe doctrine of Christ which the missionary was there to preach!\n\nMr. Sjoblom seems to have been unable to believe at first that such deeds\nwere done with the knowledge and approval of the whites. He ventured to\nappeal to the Commissary. \"He turned in anger on me,\" he adds, \"and in the\npresence of the soldiers said that he would expel me from the town if I\nmeddled with matters of that kind any more.\"\n\nIt would, indeed, have been rather absurd for the Commissary to interfere\nwhen the severed hand had actually been cut off in order to be presented\nto him. The whole procedure is explained in the following paragraph:\n\n    \"If the rubber does not reach the full amount required, the sentinels\n    attack the natives. They kill some and bring the hands to the\n    Commissary. Others are brought to the Commissary as prisoners. At the\n    beginning they came with their smoked hands. The sentinels, or else\n    the boys in attendance on them, put these hands on a little kiln, and\n    after they had been smoked, they by and by put them on the top of the\n    rubber baskets. I have on many occasions seen this done.\"\n\nThen we read in the latest State papers of the Belgian diplomatists that\nthey propose to continue the beneficent and civilizing work which they\nhave inherited.\n\nYet another paragraph from Mr. Sjoblom showing the complicity of the\nBelgian authorities, and showing also that the presence of the\nmissionaries was some deterrent against open brutality. If, then, they saw\nas much as they did, what must have been the condition of those huge\ntracts of country where no missions existed?\n\n    \"At the end of 1895, the Commissary--all the people were gathering the\n    rubber--said he had often told the sentinels not to kill the people.\n    But on the 14th of December a sentinel passed our mission station and\n    a woman accompanied him, carrying a basket of hands. Mr. and Mrs.\n    Banks, besides myself, went down the road, and they told the sentinel\n    to put the hands on the road that they might count them. We counted\n    eighteen right hands smoked and from the size of the hands we could\n    judge that they belonged to men, women and children. We could not\n    understand why these hands had been collected, as the Commissary had\n    given orders that no more natives were to be killed for their hands.\n    On my last journey I discovered the secret. One Monday night, a\n    sentinel who had just returned from the Commissary, said to me: 'What\n    are the sentinels to do? When all the people are gathered together,\n    the Commissary openly tells us not to kill any more people, but when\n    the people have gone he tells us privately that if they do not bring\n    plenty of india-rubber we must kill some, but not bring the hands to\n    him.' Some sentinels, he told me, had been put in chains because they\n    killed some natives who happened to be near a mission station; but it\n    was only because he thought it might become known that the Commissary,\n    to justify himself, had put the men in chains. I said to the sentinel:\n    'You should obey the first command, never to kill any more.' 'The\n    people,' he answered, 'unless they are frightened, do not bring in the\n    rubber, and then the Commissary flogs us with the hippopotamus hide,\n    or else he puts us in chains, or sends us to Boma.' The sentinel\n    added that the Commissary induced him to hide cruelty while letting it\n    go on, and to do this in such a way that he might be justified, in\n    case it should become known and an investigation should be made. In\n    such a case the Commissary could say, 'Why, I told him openly not to\n    kill any more' and he might put the blame on the soldier to justify\n    himself, though the blame and the punishment in all its force ought to\n    have been put on himself, after he had done such a terrible act in\n    order to disguise or mislead justice. If the sentinels were puzzled\n    about this message, what would the natives be?\"\n\nI have said that there was more to be said for the cannibal murderers than\nfor those who worked the system. The capitas pleaded the same excuse.\n\"Don't take this to heart so much,\" said one of them to the missionary.\n\"They kill us if we do not bring rubber. The Commissary has promised us if\nwe bring plenty of hands he will shorten our service. I have brought\nplenty already, and I expect my time will soon be finished.\"\n\nThat the Commissaries are steeped to the lips in this horrible business\nhas been amply shown in these paragraphs. But Mr. Sjoblom was able to go\none stage further along the line which leads to the Palace at Brussels. M.\nWahis, the Governor-General, a man who has played a sinister part in the\ncountry, came up the river and endeavoured to get the outspoken Swede to\ncontradict himself, or, failing that, to intimidate him. To get at the\ntruth or to right the wrong seems to have been the last thing in his mind,\nfor he knew well that the wrong was essential to the system, and that\nwithout it the wheels would move more slowly and the head engineer in\nEurope would soon wish to know what was amiss with his rubber-producing\nmachine. \"You may have seen all these things that you have stated,\" said\nhe, \"but nothing is proved.\" The Commissary meanwhile had been holding a\nrifle to the head of witnesses so as to make sure that nothing would be\nproved. In spite of this Mr. Sjoblom managed to collect his evidence, and\ngoing to the Governor, asked him when he could listen to it. \"I don't want\nto hear any witnesses,\" said he, and then: \"If you continue to demand\ninvestigation in these matters we will make a charge against you.... That\nmeans five years' imprisonment.\"\n\nSuch is Mr Sjoblom's narrative involving Governor Wahis in the general\ninfamy. \"It is not true,\" cries the Congolese apologist. Strange how\nSwedes, Americans, and British, laymen and clergy, all unite in defaming\nthis innocent State! No doubt the wicked children lop off their own hands\nin order to cast a slur upon \"the benevolent and philanthropic enterprise\nof the Congo.\" Tartuffe and Jack the Ripper--was ever such a combination\nin the history of the world!\n\nOne more anecdote of Mr. Wahis, for it is not often that we can get a\nGovernor of the Congo in person face to face with the results of his own\nwork. As he passed down the river, Mr. Sjoblom was able to report another\noutrage to him:\n\n    \"Mr. Banks told the Governor that he had seen it himself, whereupon M.\n    Wahis summoned the commandant in charge--the officer who had ordered\n    the raid had already gone elsewhere--and asked him in French if the\n    story were true. The Belgian officer assured M. Wahis that it was, but\n    the latter, thinking Mr. Banks did not understand French, said: 'After\n    all, you may have seen this; but you have no witnesses.' 'Oh,' said\n    Mr. Banks, 'I can call the commandant, who has just told you that it\n    is true.' M. Wahis then tried to minimize the matter, when, to his\n    great surprise, Mr. Banks added: 'In any case I have, at his own\n    request, furnished to the British Consul, who passed through here\n    lately, a signed statement concerning it.' M. Wahis rose from his\n    chair, saying: 'Oh, then, it is all over Europe!' Then for the first\n    time he said that the responsible Commissary must be punished.\"\n\nIt need not be added that the punishment was the merest farce.\n\nThese successive reports, each amplifying the other, coming on the top of\nthe killing of Mr. Stokes, and the action of the British Colonial Office\nin prohibiting recruiting for Congoland, had the effect of calling strong\nattention to the condition of that country. The charges were met partly by\ndenial, partly by general phrases about morality, and partly by bogus\nreform. M. van Eetvelde, in Brussels, and M. Jules Houdret, in London,\ndenied things which have since been proved up to the hilt. The reform took\nthe shape of a so-called Natives' Protection Commission. Like all these\nso-called reforms, it was utterly ineffectual, and was only meant for\nEuropean consumption. No one knew so well as the men at Brussels that no\npossible reform could have any effect whatever unless the system was\nitself abolished, for that system produced outrages as logically and\ncertainly as frost produces ice. The sequel will show the results of the\nNatives' Protection Commission.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nFURTHER FRUITS OF THE SYSTEM\n\n\nFor a moment I must interrupt the narrative of the long, dismal succession\nof atrocities in order to explain certain new factors in the situation.\n\nIt has already been shown that the Congo State, unable to handle the whole\nof its vast domain, had sublet large tracts of it to monopolist companies,\nin absolute contradiction to Article V. of the Berlin Treaty. Up to the\nyear 1897, these companies were registered in Belgium, and had some\npretence to being international in scope. The State had no open or direct\ncontrol over them. This was now altered. The State drew closer the bonds\nwhich united it to these commercial undertakings. They were, for the most\npart, dissolved, and then reconstructed under Congo law. In most cases, in\nreturn for the monopoly, the State was given control, sometimes to the\nextent of appointing all managers and agents. Half the shares of the\ncompany or half the profits were usually made over to the State. Thus one\nmust bear in mind in future that whether one talks of the Abir Company, of\nthe Kasai, the Katanga, the Anversoise, or any other, it is really with\nthe State--that is, with King Leopold--that one has to do. He owned the\ncompanies, but paid them fifty per cent. commission for doing all the\nwork. As their profits were such as might be expected where nothing was\npaid either for produce or for labour (varying from fifty to seven hundred\nper cent. per annum), all parties to the bargain were the gainers.\n\nAnother new factor in the situation was the completion, in 1898, of the\nLower Congo Railway, which connects Boma with Stanley Pool, and so\noutflanks the cataracts. The enterprise itself was beneficent and\nsplendid. The means by which it was carried out were unscrupulous and\ninhuman. Had civilization no complaint against the Congo State save the\nhistory of its railway construction with its forced labour, so different\nto the tradition of the tropical procedure of other European colonies, it\nwould be a heavy indictment. Now it sinks to insignificance when compared\nwith the enslavement of a whole people and the twenty years of\nuninterrupted massacre. As a sketch of the condition of the railway\ndistrict here is a little pen picture by M. Edouard Picard, of the Belgian\nSenate, who saw it in the building:\n\n    \"The cruel impression conveyed by the mutilated forests,\" he wrote,\n    \"is heightened in the places where, till lately, native villages\n    nestled, hidden and protected by thick and lofty foliage. The\n    inhabitants have fled. They have fled in spite of encouraging palavers\n    and promises of peace and kind treatment. They have burnt their huts,\n    and great heaps of cinders mark the sites, amid deserted palm-groves\n    and trampled-down banana fields. The terrors caused by the memory of\n    inhuman floggings, of massacres, of rapes and abductions, haunt their\n    poor brains, and they go as fugitives to seek shelter in the recesses\n    of the hospitable bush, or, across the frontiers, to find it in French\n    or Portuguese Congo, not yet afflicted with so many labours and\n    alarms, far from the roads traversed by white men, those baneful\n    intruders, and their train of strange and disquieting habits.\" The\n    outlook was as gloomy when he wandered along the path trodden by the\n    caravans to the Pool and back again. \"We are constantly meeting these\n    carriers, either isolated or in Indian file; blacks, blacks, miserable\n    blacks, with horribly filthy loin-clothes for their only garments;\n    their bare and frizzled heads supporting their loads--chest, bale,\n    ivory-tusk, hamper of rubber, or barrel; for the most part broken\n    down, sinking under the burdens made heavier by their weariness and\n    insufficiency of food, consisting of a handful of rice and tainted\n    dried fish; pitiful walking caryatids; beasts of burden with the lank\n    limbs of monkeys, pinched-up features, eyes fixed and round with the\n    strain of keeping their balance and the dulness of exhaustion. Thus\n    they come and go by thousands, organized in a system of human\n    transport, requisitioned by the State armed with its irresistible\n    _force publique_, supplied by the chiefs whose slaves they are and who\n    pounce on their wages; jogging on, with knees bent and stomach\n    protruding, one arm raised up and the other resting on a long stick,\n    dusty and malodorous; covered with insects as their huge procession\n    passes over mountains and through valleys; dying on the tramp, or,\n    when the tramp is over, going to their villages to die of exhaustion.\"\n\nIt will be remembered that Captain Lothaire, having been acquitted of the\nmurder of Mr. Stokes, was sent out by King Leopold to act as\nmanaging-director of the Anversoise Trust. In 1898, he arrived in the\nMongalla District, and from then onward there came to Europe vague rumours\nof native attacks and bloody reprisals, with those other symptoms of\nviolence and unrest which might be expected where a large population\naccustomed to freedom is suddenly reduced to slavery. How huge were the\nrubber operations which were carried through under the ferocious rule of\nCaptain Lothaire, may be guessed from the fact that the profits of the\ncompany, which had been 120,000 francs in 1897, rose to 3,968,000 in\n1899--a sum which is considerably more than twice the total capital. M.\nMille tells of a Belgian agent who showed 25,000 cartridges and remarked,\n\"I can turn those into 25,000 pounds of rubber.\" Captain Lothaire believed\nin the same trade methods, for his fighting and his output increased\ntogether. It is worth while to slaughter one-fourth of the population if\nthe effect is to drive the others to frenzied and unceasing work.\n\nNo definite details might ever have reached Europe of those doings had not\nLothaire made the capital mistake of quarrelling with his subordinates.\nOne of these, named Lacroix, sent a communication to the _Nieuw Gazet_, of\nAntwerp, which, with the _Petit Bleu_, acted an honourable and independent\npart at this epoch. The Congo Press Bureau, which has stifled the voice of\nthe more venal portion of the Belgian and Parisian Press, had not at that\ntime attained the efficiency which it afterward reached. This letter from\nLacroix was published on April 10th, 1900, and shed a lurid light upon\nwhat had been going on in the Mongalla District. It was a confession, but\na confession which involved his superiors as well as himself. He told how\nhe had been instructed by his chief to massacre all the natives of a\ncertain village which had been slow in bringing its rubber. He had carried\nout the order. Later, his chief had put sixty women in irons, and allowed\nnearly all of them to die of hunger because the village--Mummumbula--had\nnot brought enough rubber. \"I am going to be tried,\" he wrote, \"for having\nmurdered one hundred and fifty men, for having crucified women and\nchildren, and for having mutilated many men and hung the remains on the\nvillage fence.\" At the same moment as this confession of Lacroix, _Le\nPetit Bleu_ published sworn affidavits of soldiers employed by the Trust,\ntelling how they had put to death whole villages for being short with\ntheir rubber. Moray, another agent, published a confession in _Le Petit\nBleu_, from which this is an extract:\n\n    \"At Ambas we were a party of thirty, under Van Eycken, who sent us\n    into a village to ascertain if the natives were collecting rubber, and\n    in the contrary case to murder all, including men, women and children.\n    We found the natives sitting peaceably. We asked them what they were\n    doing. They were unable to reply, thereupon we fell upon them all, and\n    killed them without mercy. An hour later we were joined by Van Eycken,\n    and told him what had been done. He answered: 'It is well, but you\n    have not done enough!' Thereupon he ordered us to cut off the heads of\n    the men and hang them on the village palisades, also their sexual\n    members, and to hang the women and children on the palisades in the\n    form of a cross.\"\n\nIn the face of these fresh revelations there was an outburst of feeling in\nBelgium, showing that it is only their ignorance of the true facts which\nprevents the inhabitants of that country from showing the same humanity as\nany other civilized nation would do. They have not yet realized the foul\nthings which have been done in their name. Surely when they do realize it\nthere will be a terrible reckoning! Some were already very alive to the\nquestion. MM. Vandervelde and Lorand fought bravely in the Chamber. The\nofficials, with MM. Liebrichts and De Cuvelier at their head, made the\nusual vague professions and general denials. \"Ah, you can rest assured\nlight will be forthcoming, complete, striking!\" cried the former. Light\nwas indeed forthcoming, though not so complete as might be wished, for\nsome, at least, of the scoundrels implicated were tried and condemned. In\nany other European colony they would have been hanged offhand, as the\nvillainous murderers that they were. But they do not hang white men in the\nCongoland, even with the blood of a hundred murders on their hands. The\nonly white man ever hanged there was the Englishman Stokes for competing\nin trade.\n\nWhat is to be remarked, however, is that only subordinates were punished.\nVan Eycken was acquitted; Lacroix had imprisonment; Mattheys, another\nagent accused of horrible practices, got twelve years--which sounded well\nat the time, but he was liberated at the end of three. In the sentence\nupon this man the Judge used the words, \"Seeing that it is just to take\ninto account the example which his superiors gave him in showing no\nrespect for the lives or rights of the natives.\" Brave words, but how\nhelpless is justice when such words can be said, and no result follow!\nThey referred, of course, to Captain Lothaire, who had, in the meanwhile,\nfled aboard a steamer at Matadi, and made his escape to Europe. His\nflight was common knowledge, but who would dare to lay his hand upon the\nfavourite of the King. Lothaire has had occasion several times since to\nvisit the Congo, but Justice has indeed sat with bandaged eyes where that\nman was concerned!\n\nThere is one incident which should be marked in the story of this trial.\nMoray, whose testimony would have been of great importance, was found dead\nin his bed just before the proceedings. There have been several such\nhappenings in Congo history. Commandant Dooms, having threatened to expose\nthe misdeeds of Lieutenant Massard before Europe, was shortly afterward\ndeclared to have been mysteriously drowned by a hippopotamus. Dr. Barotti,\nreturning hot with anger after an inspection of the State, declares\nvehemently that he was poisoned. There is much that is of the sixteenth\ncentury in this State, besides its views of its duties to the natives.\n\nBefore passing these revelations with the attendant burst of candour in\nthe Belgian Press, it may be well to transcribe the following remark in an\ninterview from a returned Congo official which appeared in the _Antwerp\nNieuw Gazet_ (April 10th, 1900). He says:\n\n    \"When first commissioned to establish a fort, I was given some native\n    soldiers and a prodigious stock of ammunition. My chief gave me the\n    following instructions: 'Crush every obstacle!' I obeyed, and cut\n    through my district by fire and sword. I had left Antwerp thinking I\n    was simply to gather rubber. Great was my stupefaction when the truth\n    dawned on me.\"\n\nThis, with the letter of Lieutenant Tilken, as quoted before, gives some\ninsight into the position of the agent.\n\nIndeed, there is something to be said for these unfortunate men, for it is\na more awful thing to be driven to crime than to endure it. Consider the\nsequence of events! The man sees an advertisement offering a commercial\nsituation in the tropics. He applies to a bureau. He is told that the\nsalary is some seventy-five pounds a year, with a bonus on results. He\nknows nothing of the country or conditions. He accepts. He is then asked\nif he has any money. He has not. One hundred pounds is advanced to him for\nexpenses and outfit, and he is pledged to work it off. He goes out and\nfinds the terrible nature of the task before him. He must condone crime to\nget his results. Suppose he resigns? \"Certainly,\" say the authorities;\n\"but you must remain there until you have worked off your debt!\" He\ncannot possibly get down the river, for the steamers are all under\nGovernment control. What can he do then? There is one thing which he very\nfrequently does, and that is to blow out his brains. The statistics of\nsuicide are higher than in any service in the world. But suppose he takes\nthe line: \"Very well, I will stay if you make me do so, but I will expose\nthese misdeeds to Europe.\" What then? The routine is a simple one. An\nofficial charge is preferred against him of ill-treating the natives.\nIll-treating of some sort is always going forward, and there is no\ndifficulty with the help of the sentries in proving that something for\nwhich the agent is responsible does not tally with the written law,\nhowever much it might be the recognized custom. He is taken to Boma, tried\nand condemned. Thus it comes about that the prison of Boma may at the same\ntime contain the best men and the worst--the men whose ideas were too\nhumane for the authorities as well as those whose crimes could not be\noverlooked even by a Congolese administration. Take warning, you who seek\nservice in this dark country, for suicide, the Boma prison, or such deeds\nas will poison your memory forever are the only choice which will lie\nbefore you.\n\nHere is the sort of official circular which descends in its thousands upon\nthe agent. This particular one was from the Commissioner in the Wille\ndistrict:\n\n    \"I give you _carte blanche_ to procure 4,000 kilos of rubber a month.\n    You have two months in which to work your people. Employ gentleness at\n    first, and if they persist in resisting the demands of the State,\n    employ force of arms.\"\n\nAnd this State was formed for the \"moral and material advantage of the\nnative.\"\n\nWhile dealing with trials of Boma I will give some short account of the\nCaudron case, which occurred in 1904. This case was remarkable as\nestablishing judicially what was always clear enough: the complicity\nbetween the State and the criminal. Caudron was a man against whom 120\ncold-blooded murders were charged. He was, in fact, a zealous and\nefficient agent of the Anversoise Society, that same company whose\nred-edged securities rose to such a height when Manager Lothaire taught\nthe natives what a minister in the Belgian House described as the\nChristian law of work. He did his best for the company, and he did his\nbest for himself, for he had a three per cent. commission upon the\nrubber. Why he should be chosen among all his fellow-murderers is hard to\nexplain, but it was so, and he found himself at Boma with a sentence of\ntwenty years. On appealing, this was reduced to fifteen years, which\nexperience has shown to mean in practice two or three. The interesting\npoint of his trial, however, is that his appeal, and the consequent\ndecrease of sentence which justified that appeal, were based upon the\nclaim that the Government was cognisant of the murderous raids, and that\nthe Government soldiers were used to effect them. The points brought out\nby the trial were:\n\n    1. The existence of a system of organized oppression, plunder, and\n    massacre, in order to increase the output of india-rubber for the\n    benefit of a \"company,\" which is only a covering name for the\n    Government itself.\n\n    2. That the local authorities of the Government are cognisant, and\n    participatory in this system.\n\n    3. That local officials of the Government engage in these rubber\n    raids, and that Government troops are regularly employed there on.\n\n    4. That the Judicature is powerless to place the real responsibility\n    on the proper shoulders.\n\n    5. That, consequently, these atrocities will continue until the system\n    itself is extirpated.\n\nCaudron's counsel called for the production of official documents to show\nhow the chain of responsibility went, but the President of the Appeal\nCourt refused it, knowing as clearly as we do, that it could only conduct\nto the Throne itself.\n\nOne might ask how the details of this trial came to Europe when it is so\nseldom that anything leaks out from the Courts of Boma. The reason was\nthat there lived in Boma a British coloured subject named Shanir, who was\nat the pains to attend the court day by day in order to preserve some\nrecord of the procedure. This he dispatched to Europe. The sequel is\ninteresting. The man's trade, which was a very large one, was boycotted,\nhe lost his all, brooded over his misfortunes, and finally took his own\nlife--another martyr in the cause of the Congo.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nVOICES FROM THE DARKNESS\n\n\nI will now return to the witnesses of the shocking treatment of the\nnatives. Rev. Joseph Clark was an American missionary living at Ikoko in\nthe Crown Domain, which is King Leopold's own special private preserve.\nThese letters cover the space between 1893 and 1899.\n\nThis is Ikoko as he found it in 1893:\n\n    \"Irebo contains say 2,000 people. Ikoko has at least 4,000 and there\n    are other towns within easy reach, several as large as Irebo, and two\n    probably as large as Ikoko. The people are fine-looking, bold and\n    active.\"\n\nIn 1903 there were 600 people surviving.\n\nIn 1894 Ikoko in the Crown Domain began to feel the effects of \"moral and\nmaterial regeneration.\" On May 30th of that year Mr. Clark writes:\n\n    \"Owing to trouble with the State the Irebo people fled and left their\n    homes. Yesterday the State soldiers shot a sick man who had not\n    attempted to run away, and others have been killed by the State\n    (native) soldiers, who, in the absence of a white man, do as they\n    please.\"\n\nIn November, 1894:\n\n    \"At Ikoko quite a number of people have been killed by the soldiers,\n    and most of the others are living in the bush.\"\n\nIn the same month he complained officially to Commissaire Fievez:\n\n    \"If you do not come soon and stop the present trouble the towns will\n    be empty.... I entreat you to help us to have peace on the Lake.... It\n    seems so hard to see the dead bodies in the creek and on the beach,\n    and to know why they are killed.... People are living in the bush like\n    wild beasts without shelter or proper food, and afraid to make fires.\n    Many died in this way. One woman ran away with three children--they\n    all died in the forest, and the woman herself came back a wreck and\n    died before long--ruined by exposure and starvation. We knew her well.\n    My hope in 1894 was to get the facts put before King Leopold, as I was\n    sure he knew nothing of the awful conditions of the collection of the\n    so-called 'rubber tax.'\"\n\nOn November 28th he writes:\n\n    \"The State soldiers brought in seven hands, and reported having shot\n    the people in the act of running away to the French side, etc.\"\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    \"We found all that the soldiers had reported was untrue, and that the\n    statements made by the natives to me were true. We saw only six\n    bodies; a seventh had evidently fallen into the water, and we learned\n    in a day or two that an eighth body had floated into the landing-place\n    above us--a woman that had either been thrown or had fallen into the\n    water after being shot.\"\n\nOn December 5th, he says:\n\n    \"A year ago we passed or visited between here and Ikoko the following\n    villages:\n\n                                    Probable population\n          Lobwaka                          250\n          Boboko                           250\n          Bosungu                          100\n          Kenzie                           150\n          Bokaka                           200\n          Mosenge                          150\n          Ituta                             80\n          Ngero                          2,000\n                                         -----\n                  Total                  3,180\n\n    \"A week ago I went up, and only at Ngero were there any people: there\n    we found ten. Ikoko did not contain over twelve people other than\n    those employed by Frank. Beyond Ikoko the case is the same.\"\n\nApril 12th, 1895, he writes:\n\n    \"I am sorry that rubber palavers continue. Every week we hear of some\n    fighting, and there are frequent 'rows,' even in our village, with\n    the armed and unruly soldiers.... During the past twelve months it has\n    cost more lives than native wars and superstition would have\n    sacrificed in three to five years. The people make this comparison\n    among themselves.... It seems incredible and awful to think of these\n    savage men armed with rifles and let loose to hunt and kill people,\n    because they do not get rubber to sell at a mere nothing to the State,\n    _and it is blood-curdling to see them returning with hands of the\n    slain and to find the hands of young children, amongst bigger ones,\n    evidencing their 'bravery.'_\"\n\nThe following was written on May 3rd, 1895:\n\n    \"The war on account of rubber. The State demands that the natives\n    shall make rubber and sell same to its agents at a very low price. The\n    natives do not like it. It is hard work and very poor pay, and takes\n    them away from their homes into the forest, where they feel very\n    unsafe, as there are always feuds among them.... The rubber from this\n    district has cost hundreds of lives, and the scenes I have witnessed\n    while unable to help the oppressed have been almost enough to make me\n    wish I were dead. The soldiers, are themselves savages, some even\n    cannibals, trained to use rifles and in many cases they are sent away\n    without supervision, and they do as they please. When they come to any\n    town no man's property or wife is safe, and when they are at war they\n    are like devils.\n\n    \"_Imagine them returning from fighting some 'rebels'; see, on the bow\n    of the canoe is a pole and a bundle of something on it.... These are\n    the hands (right hands) of sixteen warriors they have slain.\n    'Warriors!' Don't you see among them the hands of little children and\n    girls (young girls or boys)? I have seen them. I have seen where even\n    the trophy has been cut off while yet the poor heart beat strongly\n    enough to shoot the blood from the cut arteries to a distance of fully\n    four feet._\"\n\n    \"A young baby was brought here one time; its mother was taken\n    prisoner, and before her eyes they threw the infant in the water to\n    drown it. The soldiers coolly told me and my wife that their white man\n    did not want them to bring infants to their place. They dragged the\n    women off and left the infant beside us, but we sent the child to its\n    mother, and said we would report the matter to the chief of the post.\n    We did so, but the men were not punished. The principal offender was\n    told before me he would get fifty lashes, but I heard the same mouth\n    send a message to say he would not be flogged.\"\n\nCompare with this the following extracts from King Leopold's _Officiel\nBulletin_, referring to this very tract of country:\n\n    \"The exploitation of the rubber vines of this district was undertaken\n    barely three years ago by M. Fievez. The results he obtained have been\n    unequalled. The district produced in 1895 more than 650 tons of\n    rubber, bought (_sic_) for 2-1\/2_d._ (European price), and sold at\n    Antwerp for 5_s._ 5_d._ per kilo (2 lbs.).\"\n\nA later bulletin adds:\n\n    \"With this development of general order is combined an inevitable\n    amelioration in the native's condition of existence _wherever he comes\n    into contact with the European element_....\n\n    \"Such is, in fact, one of the ends of the general policy of the State,\n    to _promote the regeneration of the race by instilling into him a\n    higher idea of the necessity of labour_.\"\n\nTruly, I know nothing in history to match such documents as these--pirates\nand bandits have never descended to that last odious abyss of hypocrisy.\nIt stands alone, colossal in its horror, colossal, too, in its effrontery.\n\nA few more anecdotes from the worthy Mr. Clark. This is an extract from a\nletter to the Chief of the District, Mueller:\n\n    \"There is a matter I want to report to you regarding the Nkake\n    sentries. You remember some time ago they took eleven canoes and shot\n    some Ikoko people. As a proof they went to you with some hands, of\n    which three were the hands of little children. We heard from one of\n    their paddlers that one child was not dead when its hand was cut off,\n    but did not believe the story. Three days after we were told the child\n    was still alive in the bush. I sent four of my men to see, and they\n    brought back a little girl whose right hand had been cut off, and she\n    left to die from the wound. The child had no other wound. As I was\n    going to see Dr. Reusens about my own sickness I took the child to\n    him, and he has cut the arm and made it right and I think she will\n    live. But I think such awful cruelty should be punished.\"\n\nMr. Clark still clung to the hope that King Leopold did not know of the\nresults of his own system. On March 25th, 1896, he writes:\n\n    \"_This rubber traffic is steeped in blood, and if the natives were to\n    rise and sweep every white person on the upper Congo into eternity\n    there would still be left a fearful balance to their credit._ Is it\n    not possible for some American of influence to see the King of the\n    Belgians, and let him know what is being done in his name? _The Lake\n    is reserved for the King_--no traders allowed--and _to collect rubber\n    for him hundreds of men, women and children have been shot_.\"\n\nAt last the natives, goaded beyond endurance, rose against their\noppressors. Who can help rejoicing that they seem to have had some\nsuccess?\n\n_Extracts from letter-book commencing January 29th, 1897_:\n\n    \"The native uprising. This was brought about at last by sentries\n    robbing and badly treating an important chief. _In my presence_ he\n    laid his complaint before M. Mueller, reporting the seizure of his\n    wives and goods and the personal violence he had suffered at the hands\n    of M. Mueller's soldiers stationed in his town. _I saw M. Mueller kick\n    him off his veranda._ Within forty-eight hours there were no\n    'sentries' or their followers left in that chief's town--they were\n    killed and mutilated--and soon after M. Mueller, with another white\n    officer and many soldiers, were killed, and the revolt began.\"\n\nSuch is some of the evidence, a very small portion of the whole narrative\nfurnished by Mr. Clark. Remember that it is extracted from a long series\nof letters written to various people during a succession of years. One\ncould conceive a single statement being a concoction, but the most\ningenious apologist for the Congo methods could not explain how such a\ndocument as this could be other than true.\n\nSo much for Mr. Clark, the American. The evidence of Mr. Scrivener, the\nEnglishman, covering roughly the same place and date, will follow. But\nlest the view should seem too Anglo-Saxon, let me interpolate a paragraph\nfrom the travels of a Frenchman, M. Leon Berthier, whose diary was\npublished by the Colonial Institute of Marseilles in 1902:\n\n    \"Belgian post of Imesse well constructed. The Chef de Poste is absent.\n    He has gone to punish the village of M'Batchi, guilty of being a\n    little late in paying the rubber tax.... A canoe full of Congo State\n    soldiers returns from the pillage of M'Batchi.... Thirty killed, fifty\n    wounded.... At three o'clock arrive at M'Batchi, the scene of the\n    bloody punishment of the Chef de Poste at Imesse. Poor village! The\n    d\u00c3\u00a9bris of miserable huts.... One goes away humiliated and saddened\n    from these scenes of desolation, filled with indescribable feelings.\"\n\nIn showing the continuity of the Congo horror and the extent of its\nduration (an extent which is the shame of the great Powers who acquiesced\nin it by their silence), I have marshalled witnesses in their successive\norder. Messrs. Glave, Murphy and Sjoblom have covered the time from 1894\nto 1897; Mr. Clark has carried it on to 1900; we have had the deeds of\n1901-4 as revealed in the Boma Law Courts. I shall now give the experience\nof Rev. Mr. Scrivener, an English missionary, who in July, August and\nSeptember, 1903, traversed a section of the Crown Domain, that same region\nspecially assigned to King Leopold in person, in which Mr. Clark had spent\nso many nightmare years. We shall see how far the independent testimony of\nthe Englishman and the American, the one extracted from a diary, the other\nfrom a succession of letters, corroborate each other:\n\n    \"At six in the morning woke up to find it still raining. It kept on\n    till nine, and we managed to get off by eleven. All the cassava bread\n    was finished the day previous, so a little rice was cooked, but it was\n    a hungry crowd that left the little village. I tried to find out\n    something about them. They said they were runaways from a district a\n    little distance away, where rubber was being collected. They told us\n    some horrible tales of murder and starvation, and when we heard all we\n    wondered that men so maltreated should be able to live without\n    retaliation. The boys and girls were naked, and I gave them each a\n    strip of calico, much to their wonderment....\n\n    \"Four hours and a half brought us to a place called Sa.... On the way\n    we passed two villages with more people than we had seen for days.\n    There may have been 120. Close to the post was another small village.\n    We decided to stay there the rest of the day. Three chiefs came in\n    with all the adult members of their people, and altogether there were\n    not 300. And this where, not more than six or seven years ago, there\n    were at least 3,000! It made one's heart heavy to listen to the tales\n    of bloodshed and cruelty. And it all seemed so foolish. To kill the\n    people off in the wholesale way in which it has been done in this Lake\n    district, because they would not bring in a sufficient quantity of\n    rubber to satisfy the white man--and now here is an empty country and\n    a very much diminished output of rubber as the inevitable\n    consequence....\"\n\nFinally Mr. Scrivener emerged in the neighbourhood of a \"big State\nstation.\" He was hospitably received, and had many chats with his host,\nwho seems to have been a very decent sort of man, doing his best under\nvery trying circumstances. His predecessor had worked incalculable havoc\nin the country, and the present occupant of the post was endeavouring to\ncarry out the duties assigned to him (those duties consisting, as usual,\nof orders to get all the rubber possible out of the people) with as much\nhumanity as the nature of the task permitted. In this he, no doubt, did\nwhat was possible as one whom the system had not yet degraded to its\nlevel--one of the rare few: and one cannot wonder that they should be\nrare, seeing the nature of the bonds, and the helplessness in which an\nofficial is placed who does not carry out the full desires of his\nsuperiors. But he had only succeeded in getting himself into trouble with\nthe district commander in consequence. He showed Mr. Scrivener a letter\nfrom the latter upbraiding him for not using more vigorous means, telling\nhim to talk less and shoot more, and reprimanding him for not killing more\nthan one man in a district under his care where there was a little\ntrouble.\n\nMr. Scrivener had the opportunity while at this State post, under the\n_r\u00c3\u00a9gime_ of a man who was endeavouring to be as humane as his instructions\nallowed, to actually see the process whereby the secret revenues of the\n\"Crown Domain\" are obtained. He says:\n\n    \"Everything was on a military basis, but, so far as I could see, the\n    one and only reason for it all was rubber. It was the theme of every\n    conversation, and it was evident that the only way to please one's\n    superiors was to increase the output somehow. I saw a few men come in,\n    and the frightened look even now on their faces tells only too\n    eloquently of the awful time they have passed through. As I saw it\n    brought in, each man had a little basket, containing, say, four or\n    five pounds of rubber. This was emptied into a larger basket and\n    weighed, and being found sufficient, each man was given a cupful of\n    coarse salt, and to some of the head-men a fathom of calico.... I\n    heard from the white men and some of the soldiers some most gruesome\n    stories. The former white man (I feel ashamed of my colour every time\n    I think of him) would stand at the door of the store to receive the\n    rubber from the poor trembling wretches, who after, in some cases,\n    weeks of privation in the forest, had ventured in with what they had\n    been able to collect. A man bringing rather under the proper amount,\n    the white man flies into a rage, and seizing a rifle from one of the\n    guards, shoots him dead on the spot. Very rarely did rubber come in\n    but one or more were shot in that way at the door of the store--'to\n    make the survivors bring more next time.' Men who had tried to run\n    from the country and had been caught, were brought to the station and\n    made to stand one behind the other, and an Albini bullet sent through\n    them. 'A pity to waste cartridges on such wretches.' Only the roads to\n    and fro from the various posts are kept open, and large tracts of\n    country are abandoned to the wild beasts. The white man himself told\n    me that you could walk on for five days in one direction, and not see\n    a single village or a single human being. And this where formerly\n    there was a big tribe!...\n\n    \"As one by one the surviving relatives of my men arrived, some\n    affecting scenes were enacted. There was no falling on necks and\n    weeping, but very genuine joy was shown and tears were shed as the\n    losses death had made were told. How they shook hands and snapped\n    their fingers! What expressions of surprise--the wide-opened mouth\n    covered with the open hand to make its evidence of wonder the more\n    apparent.... So far as the State post was concerned, it was in a very\n    dilapidated condition.... On three sides of the usual huge quadrangle\n    there were abundant signs of a former population, but we only found\n    three villages--bigger, indeed, than any we had seen before, but sadly\n    diminished from what had been but recently the condition of the\n    place.... Soon we began talking, and, without any encouragement on my\n    part, they began the tales I had become so accustomed to. They were\n    living in peace and quietness when the white men came in from the Lake\n    with all sorts of requests to do this and to do that, and they thought\n    it meant slavery. So they attempted to keep the white men out of their\n    country, but without avail. The rifles were too much for them. So they\n    submitted, and made up their minds to do the best they could under the\n    altered circumstances. First came the command to build houses for the\n    soldiers, and this was done without a murmur. Then they had to feed\n    the soldiers, and all the men and women--hangers-on--who accompanied\n    them.\n\n    \"Then they were told to bring in rubber. This was quite a new thing\n    for them to do. There was rubber in the forest several days away from\n    their home, but that it was worth anything was news to them. A small\n    reward was offered, and a rush was made for the rubber; 'What strange\n    white men, to give us cloth and beads for the sap of a wild vine.'\n    They rejoiced in what they thought was their good fortune. But soon\n    the reward was reduced until they were told to bring in the rubber for\n    nothing. To this they tried to demur, but to their great surprise\n    several were shot by the soldiers, and the rest were told, with many\n    curses and blows, to go at once or more would be killed. Terrified,\n    they began to prepare their food for the fortnight's absence from the\n    village, which the collection of the rubber entailed. The soldiers\n    discovered them sitting about. 'What, not gone yet?' Bang! bang! bang!\n    bang! And down fell one and another, dead, in the midst of wives and\n    companions. There is a terrible wail, and an attempt made to prepare\n    the dead for burial, but this is not allowed. All must go at once to\n    the forest. And off the poor wretches had to go, without even their\n    tinderboxes to make fires. Many died in the forests from exposure and\n    hunger, and still more from the rifles of the ferocious soldiers in\n    charge of the post. In spite of all their efforts, the amount fell\n    off, and more and more were killed....\n\n    \"I was shown around the place, and the sites of former big chiefs'\n    settlements were pointed out. A careful estimate made the population,\n    of say, seven years ago, to be 2,000 people in and about the post,\n    within a radius of, say a quarter of a mile. All told, they would not\n    muster 200 now, and there is so much sadness and gloom that they are\n    fast decreasing.... Lying about in the grass, within a few yards of\n    the house I was occupying, were numbers of human bones, in some cases\n    complete skeletons. I counted thirty-six skulls, and saw many sets of\n    bones from which the skulls were missing. I called one of the men, and\n    asked the meaning of it. 'When the rubber palaver began,' said he,\n    'the soldiers shot so many we grew tired of burying, and very often we\n    were not allowed to bury, and so just dragged the bodies out into the\n    grass and left them. There are hundreds all round if you would like to\n    see them.' But I had seen more than enough, and was sickened by the\n    stories that came from men and women alike of the awful time they had\n    passed through. The Bulgarian atrocities might be considered as\n    mildness itself when compared with what has been done here....\n\n    \"In due course we reached Ibali. There was hardly a sound building in\n    the place.... Why such dilapidation? The Commandant away for a trip\n    likely to extend into three months, the sub-lieutenant away in another\n    direction on a punitive expedition. In other words, the station must\n    be neglected, and rubber-hunting carried out with all vigour. I stayed\n    here two days, and the one thing that impressed itself upon me was the\n    collection of rubber. I saw long files of men come, as at Mbongo, with\n    their little baskets under their arms, saw them paid their milk-tin\n    full of salt, and the two yards of calico flung to the head-men; saw\n    their trembling timidity, and, in fact, a great deal more, to prove\n    the state of terrorism that exists, and the virtual slavery in which\n    the people are held....\n\n    \"So much for the journey to the Lake. It has enlarged my knowledge of\n    the country, and also, alas! my knowledge of the awful deeds enacted\n    in the mad haste of men to get rich. So far as I know, I am the first\n    white man to go into the _Domaine Priv\u00c3\u00a9_ of the King, other than the\n    employees of the State. I expect there will be wrath in some quarters,\n    but that cannot be helped.\"\n\nSo far Mr. Scrivener. But perhaps the reader may think that there really\nwas a missionary plot to decry the Free State. Let us have some\ntravellers, then. Here is Mr. Grogan from his \"Cape to Cairo\":\n\n    \"The people were terrorized and were living in marshes.\" This was on\n    the British frontier. \"The Belgians have crossed the frontier,\n    descended into the valley, shot down large numbers of natives, British\n    subjects, driven off the young women and cattle, and actually tied up\n    and burned the old women. I do not make these statements without\n    having gone into the matter. I remarked on the absence of women and\n    the reason was given. It was on further inquiry that I was assured by\n    the natives that white men had been present when the old women had\n    been burned.... They even described to me the personal appearance of\n    the white officers with the troops.... The wretched people came to me\n    and asked me why the British had deserted them.\"\n\nFurther on he says:\n\n    \"Every village had been burned to the ground, and as I fled from the\n    country I saw skeletons, skeletons everywhere. And such postures! What\n    tales of horror they told.\"\n\nJust a word in conclusion from another witness, Mr. Herbert Frost:\n\n    \"The power of an armed soldier among enslaved people is absolutely\n    paramount. By chief or child, every command, wish, or whim of the\n    soldier must be obeyed or gratified. At his command with rifle ready a\n    man will ... outrage his own sister, give to his persecutor the wife\n    he loves most of all, say or do anything, indeed, to save his life.\n    The woes and sorrows of the race whom King Leopold has enslaved have\n    not decreased, for his Commissaire officers and agents have introduced\n    and maintain a system of deviltry hitherto undreamed of by his\n    victims.\"\n\nDoes this all seem horrible? But in the face of it is there not something\nmore horrible in a sentence of this kind?--\n\n    \"Our only programme, I am anxious to repeat, is the work of moral and\n    material regeneration, and we must do this among a population whose\n    degeneration in its inherited conditions it is difficult to measure.\n    The many horrors and atrocities which disgrace humanity give way\n    little by little before our intervention.\"\n\nIt is King Leopold who speaks.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nCONSUL ROGER CASEMENT'S REPORT\n\n\nUp to this time the published reports as to the black doings of King\nLeopold and his men were, with the exception of a guarded document from\nConsul Pickersgill, in 1898, entirely from private individuals. No doubt\nthere were official reports but the Government withheld them. In 1904,\nthis policy of reticence was abandoned, and the historic report of Consul\nRoger Casement confirmed, and in some ways amplified, all that had reached\nEurope from other sources.\n\nA word or two as to Mr. Casement's own personality and qualifications may\nnot be amiss, since both were attacked by his Belgian detractors. He is a\ntried and experienced public servant, who has had exceptional\nopportunities of knowing Africa and the natives. He entered the Consular\nService in 1892, served on the Niger till 1895, was Consul at Delagoa Bay\nto 1898, and was finally transferred to the Congo. Personally, he is a man\nof the highest character, truthful, unselfish--one who is deeply respected\nby all who know him. His experience, which deals with the Crown Domain\ndistricts in the year 1903, covers some sixty-two pages, to be read in\nfull in \"White Book, Africa, No. 1, 1904.\" I will not apologize for the\nlength of the extracts, as this, the first official exposure, was an\nhistorical document and from its publication we mark the first step in\nthat train of events which is surely destined to remove the Congo State\nfrom hands which have proved so unworthy, and to place it in conditions\nwhich shall no longer be a disgrace to European civilization. It may be\nremarked before beginning that at some of these conversations with the\nnatives Mr. Scrivener was present, and that he corroborates the account\ngiven by the Consul.\n\nThe beginning of Mr. Casement's report shows how willing he was to give\npraise where praise was possible, and to say all that could be said for\nthe Administration. He talks of \"energetic European intervention,\" and\nadds, \"that very much of this intervention has been called for no one who\nformerly knew the Upper Congo could doubt.\" \"Admirably built and admirably\nkept stations greet the traveller at many points.\" \"To-day the railway\nworks most efficiently.\" He attributes sleeping sickness as \"one cause of\nthe seemingly wholesale diminution of human life which I everywhere\nobserved in the regions re-visited; a prominent place must be assigned to\nthis malady. The natives certainly attribute their alarming death-rate to\nthis as one of the inducing causes, although they attribute, and I think\nprincipally, their rapid decrease in numbers to other causes as well.\"\n\nThe Government work shop \"was brightness, care, order, and activity, and\nit was impossible not to admire and commend the industry which had created\nand maintained in constant working order this useful establishment.\"\n\nThese are not the words of a critic who has started with a prejudiced mind\nor the desire to make out a case.\n\nIn the lower reaches of the river above Stanley Pool Casement found no\ngross ill-usage. The natives were hopeless and listless, being debarred\nfrom trade and heavily taxed in food, fish and other produce. It was not\nuntil he began to approach the cursed rubber zones that terrible things\nbegan to dawn upon him. Casement had travelled in 1887 in the Congo, and\nwas surprised to note the timidity of the natives. Soon he had his\nexplanation:\n\n    \"At one of these village, S----, after confidence had been restored\n    and the fugitives had been induced to come in from the surrounding\n    forest, where they had hidden themselves, I saw women coming back,\n    carrying their babies, their household utensils, and even the food\n    they had hastily snatched up, up to a late hour of the evening.\n    Meeting some of these returning women in one of the fields I asked\n    them why they had run away at my approach, and they said, smiling, 'We\n    thought you were Bula Matadi' (_i. e._, 'men of the Government'). Fear\n    of this kind was formerly unknown on the Upper Congo; and in much more\n    out-of-the-way places visited many years ago the people flocked from\n    all sides to greet a white stranger. But to-day the apparition of a\n    white man's steamer evidently gave the signal for instant flight.\"\n\n    \"... Men, he said, still came to him whose hands had been cut off by\n    the Government soldiers during those evil days, and he said there were\n    still many victims of this species of mutilation in the surrounding\n    country. Two cases of the kind came to my actual notice while I was in\n    the lake. One, a young man, both of whose hands had been beaten off\n    with the butt-ends of rifles against a tree, the other a young lad of\n    eleven or twelve years of age, whose right hand was cut off at the\n    wrist. This boy described the circumstances of his mutilation, and, in\n    answer to my inquiry, said that although wounded at the time he was\n    perfectly sensible of the severing of his wrist, but lay still fearing\n    that if he moved he would be killed. In both these cases the\n    Government soldiers had been accompanied by white officers whose names\n    were given to me. Of six natives (one a girl, three little boys, one\n    youth, and one old woman) who had been mutilated in this way during\n    the rubber _r\u00c3\u00a9gime_, all except one were dead at the date of my visit.\n    The old woman had died at the beginning of this year, and her niece\n    described to me how the act of mutilation in her case had been\n    accomplished.\"\n\nThe fines inflicted upon villages for trifling offences were such as to\nproduce the results here described:\n\n    \"The officer had then imposed as further punishment a fine of 55,000\n    brass rods (2,750 fr.)--\u00c2\u00a3110. This sum they had been forced to pay,\n    and as they had no other means of raising so large a sum they had,\n    many of them, been compelled to sell their children and their wives. I\n    saw no live-stock of any kind in W---- save a very few fowls--possibly\n    under a dozen--and it seemed, indeed, not unlikely that, as these\n    people asserted, they had great difficulty in always getting their\n    supplies ready. A father and mother stepped out and said that they had\n    been forced to sell their son, a little boy called F, for 1,000 rods\n    to meet their share of the fine. A widow came and declared that she\n    had been forced, in order to meet her share of the fine, to sell her\n    daughter G, a little girl whom I judged from her description to be\n    about ten years of age. She had been sold to a man in Y----, who was\n    named, for 1,000 rods, which had then gone to make up the fine.\"\n\nThe natives were broken in spirit by the treatment:\n\n    \"One of them--a strong, indeed, a splendid-looking man--broke down and\n    wept, saying that their lives were useless to them, and that they knew\n    of no means of escape from the troubles which were gathering around\n    them. I could only assure these people that their obvious course to\n    obtain relief was by appeal to their own constituted authorities, and\n    that if their circumstances were clearly understood by those\n    responsible for these fines I trusted and believed some satisfaction\n    would be forthcoming.\"\n\nThese fines, it may be added, were absolutely illegal. It was the officer,\nnot the poor, harried natives, who had broken the law.\n\n    \"These fines, it should be borne in mind, are illegally imposed; they\n    are not 'fines of Court'; are not pronounced after any judicial\n    hearing, or for any proved offence against the law, but are quite\n    arbitrarily levied according to the whim or ill-will of the executive\n    officers of the district, and their collection, as well as their\n    imposition, involves continuous breaches of the Congolese laws. They\n    do not, moreover, figure in the account of public revenues in the\n    Congo 'Budgets'; they are not paid into the public purse of the\n    country, but are spent on the needs of the station or military camp of\n    the officer imposing them, just as seems good to this official.\"\n\nHere is an illustrative anecdote:\n\n    \"One of the largest Congo Concession Companies had, when I was on the\n    Upper River, addressed a request to its Directors in Europe for a\n    further supply of ball-cartridge. The Directors had met this demand by\n    asking what had become of the 72,000 cartridges shipped some three\n    years ago, to which a reply was sent to the effect that these had all\n    been used in the production of india-rubber. I did not see this\n    correspondence, and cannot vouch for the truth of the statement; but\n    the officer who informed me that it had passed before his own eyes was\n    one of the highest standing in the interior.\"\n\nAnother witness showed the exact ratio between cartridges and rubber:\n\n    \"'The S. A. B. on the Bussira, with 150 guns, get only ten tons\n    (rubber) a month; we, the State, at Momboyo, with 130 guns, get\n    thirteen tons per month.' 'So you count by guns?' I asked him.\n    'Partout,' M. P. said. 'Each time the corporal goes out to get rubber\n    cartridges are given to him. He must bring back all not used; and for\n    every one used, he must bring back a right hand.' M. P. told me that\n    sometimes they shot a cartridge at an animal in hunting; they then cut\n    off a hand from a living man. As to the extent to which this is\n    carried on, he informed me that in six months they, the State, on the\n    Momboyo River, had used 6,000 cartridges, which means that 6,000\n    people are killed or mutilated. It means more than 6,000 for the\n    people have told me repeatedly that the soldiers kill children with\n    the butt of their guns.\"\n\nThat the statement about the cutting off of living hands is correct is\namply proved by the Kodak. I have photographs of at least twenty such\nmutilated Negroes in my own possession.\n\nHere is a copy of a dispatch from an official quoted in its naked\nfrankness:\n\n    \"Le Chef Ngulu de Wangata est envoy\u00c3\u00a9 dans la Maringa, pour m'y acheter\n    des esclaves. Pri\u00c3\u00a8re a MM. les agents de l'A.B.I.R. de bien vouloir me\n    signaler les m\u00c3\u00a9faits que celui-ci pourrait commettre en route.\n\n        \"Le Capitaine-Commandant,\n            (Sign\u00c3\u00a9) \"SARRAZZYN.\"\n\n    \"_Colquilhatville, le 1er Mai, 1896._\"\n\nPretty good for the State which boasts that it has put down the slave\ntrade.\n\nThere is a passage showing the working of the rubber system which is so\nclear and authoritative that I transcribe it in full:\n\n    \"I went to the homes of these men some miles away and found out their\n    circumstances. To get the rubber they had first to go fully a two\n    days' journey from their homes, leaving their wives, and being absent\n    for from five to six days. They were seen to the forest limits under\n    guard, and if not back by the sixth day trouble was likely to ensue.\n    To get the rubber in the forests--which, generally speaking, are very\n    swampy--involves much fatigue and often fruitless searching for a\n    well-flowing vine. As the area of supply diminishes, moreover, the\n    demand for rubber constantly increases. Some little time back I\n    learned the Bongandanga district supplied seven tons of rubber a\n    month, a quantity which it was hoped would shortly be increased to ten\n    tons. The quantity of rubber brought by the three men in question\n    would have represented, probably, for the three of them certainly not\n    less than seven kilog. of pure rubber. That would be a very safe\n    estimate, and at an average of 7fr. per kilog. they might be said to\n    have brought in \u00c2\u00a32 worth of rubber. In return for this labour, or\n    imposition, they had received goods which cost certainly under 1_s._,\n    and whose local valuation came to 45 rods (1_s._ 10_d._). As this\n    process repeats itself twenty-six times a year, it will be seen that\n    they would have yielded \u00c2\u00a352 in kind at the end of the year to the\n    local factory, and would have received in return some 24_s._ or 25_s._\n    worth of goods, which had a market value on the spot of \u00c2\u00a32 7_s._ 8_d._\n    In addition to these formal payments they were liable at times to be\n    dealt with in another manner, for should their work, which might have\n    been just as hard, have proved less profitable in its yield of rubber,\n    the local prison would have seen them. The people everywhere assured\n    me that they were not happy under this system, and it was apparent to\n    a callous eye that in this they spoke the strict truth.\"\n\nAgain I insert a passage to show that Casement was by no means an\nill-natured critic:\n\n    \"It is only right to say that the present agent of the A.B.I.R.\n    Society I met at Bongandanga seemed to me to try, in very difficult\n    and embarrassing circumstances, to minimize as far as possible, and\n    within the limits of his duties, the evils of the system I there\n    observed at work.\"\n\nSpeaking of the Mongalla massacres--those in which Lothaire was\nimplicated--he quotes from the judgment of the Court of Appeal:\n\n    \"That it is just to take into account that, by the correspondence\n    produced in the case, the chiefs of the Concession Company have, if\n    not by formal orders, at least by their example and their tolerance,\n    induced their agents to take no account whatever of the rights,\n    property, and lives of the natives; to use the arms and the soldiers\n    which should have served for their defence and the maintenance of\n    order to force the natives to furnish them with produce and to work\n    for the Company, as also to pursue as rebels and outlaws those who\n    sought to escape from the requisitions imposed upon them.... That,\n    above all, the fact that the arrest of women and their detention, to\n    compel the villages to furnish both produce and workmen, was tolerated\n    and admitted even by certain of the administrative authorities of the\n    region.\"\n\nYet another example of the workings of the system:\n\n    \"In the morning, when about to start for K----, many people from the\n    surrounding country came in to see me. They brought with them three\n    individuals who had been shockingly wounded by gun fire, two men and a\n    very small boy, not more than six years of age, and a fourth--a boy\n    child of six or seven--whose right hand was cut off at the wrist. One\n    of the men, who had been shot through the arm, declared that he was Y\n    of L----, a village situated some miles away. He declared that he had\n    been shot as I saw under the following circumstances: the soldiers had\n    entered his town, he alleged, to enforce the due fulfilment of the\n    rubber tax due by the community. These men had tied him up and said\n    that unless he paid 1,000 brass rods to them they would shoot him.\n    Having no rods to give them they had shot him through the arm and had\n    left him.\"\n\nI may say that among my photographs are several with shattered arms who\nhave been treated in this fashion.\n\nThis is how the natives were treated when they complained to the white\nman:\n\n    \"In addition, fifty women are required each morning to go to the\n    factory and work there all day. They complained that the remuneration\n    given for these services was most inadequate, and that they were\n    continually beaten. When I asked the Chief W why he had not gone to D\n    F to complain if the sentries beat him or his people, opening his\n    mouth he pointed to one of the teeth which was just dropping out, and\n    said: 'That is what I got from the D F four days ago when I went to\n    tell him what I now say to you.' He added that he was frequently\n    beaten, along with others of his people, by the white man.\"\n\nOne sentry was taken almost red-handed by Mr. Casement:\n\n    \"After some little delay a boy of about fifteen years of age appeared,\n    whose left arm was wrapped up in a dirty rag. Removing this, I found\n    the left hand had been hacked off by the wrist, and that a shot hole\n    appeared in the fleshy part of the forearm. The boy, who gave his name\n    as I I, in answer to my inquiry, said that a sentry of the La Lulanga\n    Company now in the town had cut off his hand. I proceeded to look for\n    this man, who at first could not be found, the natives to a\n    considerable number gathering behind me as I walked through the town.\n    After some delay the sentry appeared, carrying a cap-gun. The boy,\n    whom I placed before him, then accused him to his face of having\n    mutilated him. The men of the town, who were questioned in\n    succession, corroborated the boy's statement. The sentry, who gave his\n    name as K K, could make no answer to the charge. He met it by vaguely\n    saying some other sentry of the Company had mutilated I I; his\n    predecessor, he said, had cut off several hands, and probably this was\n    one of the victims. The natives around said that there were two other\n    sentries at present in the town, who were not so bad as K K, but that\n    he was a villain. As the evidence against him was perfectly clear, man\n    after man standing out and declaring he had seen the act committed, I\n    informed him and the people present that I should appeal to the local\n    authorities for his immediate arrest and trial.\"\n\nThe following extract must be my final quotation from Consul Casement's\nreport:\n\n    \"I asked then how this tax was imposed. One of them, who had been\n    hammering out an iron neck-collar on my arrival, spoke first. He said:\n\n    \"'I am N N. These other two beside me are O O and P P, all of us\n    Y----. From our country each village had to take twenty loads of\n    rubber. These loads were big: they were as big as this....' (Producing\n    an empty basket which came nearly up to the handle of my\n    walking-stick.) 'That was the first size. We had to fill that up, but\n    as rubber got scarcer the white man reduced the amount. We had to take\n    these loads in four times a month.'\n\n    \"_Q._ 'How much pay did you get for this?'\n\n    \"_A._ (Entire audience.) 'We got no pay! We got nothing!'\n\n    \"And then N N, whom I asked again, said:\n\n    \"'Our village got cloth and a little salt, but not the people who did\n    the work. Our chiefs eat up the cloth; the workers got nothing. The\n    pay was a fathom of cloth and a little salt for every big basketful,\n    but it was given to the chief, never to the men. It used to take ten\n    days to get the twenty baskets of rubber--we were always in the forest\n    and then when we were late we were killed. We had to go further and\n    further into the forest to find the rubber vines, to go without food,\n    and our women had to give up cultivating the fields and gardens. Then\n    we starved. Wild beasts--the leopards--killed some of us when we were\n    working away in the forest, and others got lost or died from exposure\n    and starvation, and we begged the white man to leave us alone, saying\n    we could get no more rubber, but the white men and their soldiers\n    said: \"Go! You are only beasts yourselves; you are nyama (meat).\" We\n    tried, always going further into the forest, and when we failed and\n    our rubber was short, the soldiers came to our towns and killed us.\n    Many were shot, some had their ears cut off: others were tied up with\n    ropes around their necks and bodies and taken away. The white men\n    sometimes at the posts did not know of the bad things the soldiers did\n    to us, but it was the white men who sent the soldiers to punish us for\n    not bringing in enough rubber.'\n\n    \"Here P P took up the tale from N N:\n\n    \"'We said to the white men, \"We are not enough people now to do what\n    you want us. Our country has not many people in it and we are dying\n    fast. We are killed by the work you make us do, by the stoppage of our\n    plantations, and the breaking up of our homes.\" The white man looked\n    at us and said: \"There are lots of people in Mputu\"' (Europe, the\n    white man's country). '\"If there are lots of people in the white man's\n    country there must be many people in the black man's country.\" The\n    white man who said this was the chief white man at F F----; his name\n    was A B; he was a very bad man. Other white men of Bula Matadi who had\n    been bad and wicked were B C, C D, and D E.' 'These had killed us\n    often, and killed us by their own hands as well as by their soldiers.\n    Some white men were good. These were E F, F G, G H, H I, I K, K L.'\n\n    \"These ones told them to stay in their homes and did not hunt and\n    chase them as the others had done, but after what they had suffered\n    they did not trust more any one's word, and they had fled from their\n    country and were now going to stay here, far from their homes, in this\n    country where there was no rubber.\n\n    \"_Q._ 'How long is it since you left your homes, since the big trouble\n    you speak of?'\n\n    \"_A._ 'It lasted for three full seasons, and it is now four seasons\n    since we fled and came into the K---- country.'\n\n    \"_Q._ 'How many days is it from N---- to your own country?'\n\n    \"_A._ 'Six days of quick marching. We fled because we could not endure\n    the things done to us. Our chiefs were hanged, and we were killed and\n    starved and worked beyond endurance to get rubber.'\n\n    \"_Q._ 'How do you know it was the white men themselves who ordered\n    these cruel things to be done to you? These things must have been done\n    without the white man's knowledge by the black soldiers.'\n\n    \"_A._ (P P): 'The white men told their soldiers: \"You kill only women;\n    you cannot kill men. You must prove that you kill men.\" So then the\n    soldiers when they killed us' (here he stopped and hesitated, and then\n    pointing to the private parts of my bulldog--it was lying asleep at my\n    feet), he said: 'then they cut off those things and took them to the\n    white men, who said: \"It is true, you have killed men.\"'\n\n    \"_Q._ 'You mean to tell me that any white man ordered your bodies to\n    be mutilated like that, and those parts of you carried to him?'\n\n    \"P P, O O, and all (shouting): 'Yes! many white men. D E did it.'\n\n    \"_Q._ 'You say this is true? Were many of you so treated after being\n    shot?'\n\n    \"All (shouting out): 'Nkoto! Nkoto!' (Very many! Very many!)\n\n    \"There was no doubt that these people were not inventing. Their\n    vehemence, their flashing eyes, their excitement, was not simulated.\n    Doubtless they exaggerated the numbers, but they were clearly telling\n    what they knew and loathed. I was told that they often became so\n    furious at the recollection of what had been done to them that they\n    lost control over themselves. One of the men before me was getting\n    into this state now.\"\n\nSuch is the story--or a very small portion of it--which His Majesty's\nConsul conveyed to His Majesty's Government as to the condition of those\nnatives, who, \"in the name of Almighty God,\" we had pledged ourselves to\ndefend!\n\nThe same damning White Book contained a brief account of Lord Cromer's\nexperience upon the Upper Nile in the Lado district. He notes that for\neighty miles the side of the river which is British territory was crowded\nwith native villages, the inhabitants of which ran along the bank calling\nto the steamer. The other bank (Congolese territory), was a deserted\nwilderness. The \"Tuquoque\" argument which King Leopold's henchmen are so\nfond of advancing will find it hard to reconcile the difference. Lord\nCromer ends his report:\n\n    \"It appears to me that the facts which I have stated above afford\n    amply sufficient evidence of the spirit which animates the Belgian\n    Administration, if, indeed, Administration it can be called. The\n    Government, so far as I could judge, is conducted almost exclusively\n    on commercial principles, and, even judged by that standard, it would\n    appear that those principles are somewhat short-sighted.\"\n\nIn the same White Book which contains these documents there is printed the\nCongolese defence drawn up by M. de Cuvelier. The defence consists in\nsimply ignoring all the definite facts laid before the public, and in\nmaking such statements as that the British have themselves made war upon\nnatives, as if there were no distinction between war and massacre, and\nthat the British have put a poll-tax upon natives, which, if it be\nreasonable in amount, is a perfectly just proceeding adopted by all\nColonial nations. Let the possessors of the Free State use this system,\nand at the same time restore the freedom of trade by throwing open the\ncountry to all, and returning to the natives that land and produce which\nhas been taken from them. When they have done this--and punished the\nguilty--there will be an end of anti-Congo agitation. Beyond this, a large\npart (nearly half) of the Congo Reply (_notes sur le rapport de Mr.\nCasement, de Dec. 11, 1903_), is taken up by trying to show that in one\ncase of mutilation the injuries were, in truth, inflicted by a wild boar.\nThere must be many wild boars in Congo land, and their habits are of a\nsingular nature. It is not in the Congo that these boars are bred.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nKING LEOPOLD'S COMMISSION AND ITS REPORT\n\n\nThe immediate effect of the publication as a State paper of the general\ncomment of Lord Cromer, and of the definite accusations of Consul\nCasement, was a demand both in Belgium and in England for an official\ninquiry. Lord Landsdowne stipulated that this inquiry should be impartial\nand thorough. It was also suggested by the British Government that it\nshould be international in character, and separated from the local\nadministration. Very grudgingly and under constant pressure the King\nappointed a Commission, but whittled down its powers to such a point that\nits proceedings must lose all utility. Such were the terms that they\nprovoked remonstrance from men like M. A. J. Wauters, the Belgian\nhistorian of the Congo Free State, who protested in the _Mouvement\nG\u00c3\u00a9ographique_ (August 7th, 1904) that such a body could serve no useful\nend. Finally, their functions were slightly increased, but they possessed\nno punitive powers and were hampered in every direction by the terms of\ntheir reference.\n\nThe _personnel_ of the Commission was worthy of the importance of the\ninquiry. M. Janssens, a well-known jurist of Belgium, was the president.\nHe impressed all who came in contact with him as a man of upright and\nsympathetic character. Baron Nisco's appointment was open to criticism, as\nhe was himself a Congo functionary, but save for that fact there was no\ncomplaint to make against him. Dr. Schumacher, a distinguished Swiss\nlawyer, was the third Commissioner. The English Government applied to have\na representative upon the tribunal, and with true Congo subtlety the\nrequest was granted after the three judges had reached the Congo. The\nEnglishman, Mr. Mackie, hurried out, but was only in time to attend the\nlast three sittings, which were held in the lower part of the river, far\nfrom the notorious rubber agents. It is worth noting that on his arrival\nhe applied for the minutes of the previous meetings and that his\napplication was refused. In Belgium the evidence of the Commission has\nnever been published, and it is safe to say that it never will be.\nFortunately the Congo missionaries took copious notes of the proceedings\nand of the testimony which came immediately under their own notice. It is\nfrom their evidence that I draw these accounts. If the Congo authorities\ncontest the accuracy of those accounts, then let them confute them forever\nand put their accusers to confusion by producing the actual minutes which\nthey hold.\n\nThe first sitting of any length of which there are records is that at\nBolobo, and extended from November 5th to 12th, 1904. The veteran, Mr.\nGrenfell, gave evidence at this sitting, and it is useful to summarize his\nviews as he was one of the men who held out longest against the\ncondemnation of King Leopold, and because his early utterances have been\nquoted as if he were a supporter of the system. He expressed to the\nCommissioners his disappointment at the failure of the Congo Government to\nrealize the promises with which it inaugurated its career. He declared he\ncould no longer wear the decorations which he had received from the\nSovereign of the Congo State. He gave it as his opinion that the ills the\ncountry was suffering from were due to the haste of a few men to get rich,\nand to the absence of anything like a serious attempt to properly police\nthe country in the interests of the people. He instanced the few judicial\nofficers, and the virtual impossibility of a native obtaining justice,\nowing to witnesses being compelled to travel long distances, either to\nLeopoldville or Boma. Mr. Grenfell spoke out emphatically against the\nadministrative _r\u00c3\u00a9gime_ on the Upper River, so far as it had been brought\nunder his notice.\n\nMr. Scrivener, a gentleman who had been twenty-three years on the Congo,\nwas the next witness. His evidence was largely the same as the \"Diary\"\nfrom which I have already quoted, concerning the condition of the Crown\nDomain. Many witnesses were examined. \"How do you know the names of the\nmen murdered?\" a lad was asked. \"One of them was my father,\" was the\ndramatic reply. \"Men of stone,\" wrote Mr. Scrivener, \"would be moved by\nthe stories that are unfolded as the Commission probes this awful history\nof rubber collection.\"\n\nMr. Gilchrist, another missionary, was a new witness. His testimony was\nconcerned with the State Domain and the Concessionnaire area, principally\non the Lulanga River. He said:\n\n    \"I also told them what we had seen on the Ikelemba, of the signs of\n    desolation in all the districts, of the heartrending stories the\n    people told us, of the butcheries wrought by the various white men of\n    the State and companies who had, from time to time, been stationed\n    there among whom a few names were notorious. I pointed out to them the\n    fact that the basin of the Ikelemba was supposed to be free-trade\n    territory also, but that everywhere the people of the various\n    districts were compelled to serve the companies of these respective\n    districts, in rubber, gum copal or food. At one out-of-the-way place\n    where we were on the south bank, two men arrived just as we were\n    leaving, with their bodies covered with marks of the chicotte, which\n    they had just received from the trader of Bosci because their quantity\n    had been short. I said to the Commissaire, given favourable\n    conditions, particularly freedom, there would soon be a large\n    population in these interior towns, the Ngombe and Mongo.\"\n\nIn answer to questions the following facts were solicited:\n\n    \"_Unsettled condition of the people._ The older people never seem to\n    have confidence to build their houses substantially. If they have any\n    suspicion of the approach of a canoe or steamer with soldiers they\n    flee.\n\n    \"_Chest disease, pneumonia, etc._ These carry off very many. The\n    people flee to the islands, live in the open air, expose themselves to\n    all kinds of weather, contract chills, which are followed by serious\n    lung troubles, and die. For years we never saw a new house because of\n    the drifting population. They have a great fear of soldiers. In the\n    case of many the absence from the villages is temporary; in the case\n    of a few they permanently settle on the north bank of the river.\n\n    \"_Want of proper nourishment._ I have witnessed the collecting of the\n    State imposition, and after this was set aside the natives had nothing\n    but leaves to eat.\"\n\nAlso, that fines, which the Commission at once declared to be illegal,\nwere constantly levied on the people, and that these fines had continued\nafter the matter had been reported to the Governor-General. In spite of\nthis declaration of illegality, no steps were taken in the matter, and M.\nde Bauw, the chief offender, was by last accounts the supreme executive\nofficial of the district. At every turn one finds that there is no\nrelation at all between law and practice in the Congo. Law is habitually\nbroken by every official from the Governor-General downward if the profits\nof the State can be increased thereby. The only stern enforcement of the\nlaws is toward the foreigner, the Austrian Rubinck, or the Englishman\nStokes, who is foolish enough to think that an international agreement is\nof more weight than the edicts of Boma. These men believed it, and met\ntheir death through their belief without redress, and even, in the case of\nthe Austrian, without public remonstrance.\n\nThe next considerable session of the Commission was at Baringa. Mr. Harris\nand Mr. Stannard, the missionaries at this station, had played a noble\npart throughout in endeavouring within their very limited powers to shield\nthe natives from their tormentors. In both cases, and also in that of Mrs.\nHarris, this had been done at the repeated risk of their lives. Their\nwhite neighbours of the rubber factories made their lives miserable also\nby preventing their receipt of food from the natives, and harassing them\nin various ways. On one occasion a chief and his son were both murdered by\nthe order of the white agent because they had supplied the Harris\nhousehold with the fore-quarter of an antelope. Before giving the terrible\ntestimony of the missionaries--a testimony which was admitted to be true\nby the chief agent of the A.B.I.R. Company on the spot, it would be well\nto show the exact standing of this Corporation and its relation to the\nState. These relations are so close that they become to all intents and\npurposes the same. The State holds fifty per cent. of the shares; it\nplaces the Government soldiers at the company's disposal; it carries up in\nthe Government steamers and supplies licenses for the great number of\nrifles and the quantity of cartridges which the company needs for its\nmurderous work. Whatever crimes are done by the company, the State is a\nclose accomplice. Finally, the European directors of this bloodstained\ncompany are, or were at the time, the Senator Van der Nest, who acted as\nPresident; and as Council: Count John d'Oultremont, Grand Marshal of the\nBelgian Court; Baron Dhanis, of Congo fame, and M. van Eetevelde, the\ncreature of the King, and the writer of so many smug despatches to the\nBritish Government about the mission of civilization and the high purpose\nof the Congo State. Now listen to some of the testimony as condensed by\nMr. Harris:\n\n    \"First, the specific atrocities during 1904 were dealt with, including\n    men, women, and children; then murders and outrages, including\n    cannibalism. From this I passed on to the imprisonment of men, women\n    and children. Following this I called attention to the destruction of\n    the Baringa towns and the partial famine among the people in\n    consequence. Also the large gangs of prisoners--men, women and\n    children--imprisoned to carry out this work; the murder of two men\n    whilst it was being done. Next followed the irregularities during\n    1903. The expedition conducted by an A.B.I.R. agent against\n    Samb'ekota, and the arming continually of A.B.I.R. sentries with\n    Albini rifles. Following this I drew attention to the administration\n    of Mons. Forcie, whose _r\u00c3\u00a9gime_ was a terrible one, including the\n    murder of Isekifasu, the principal Chief of Bolima; the killing,\n    cutting up and eating of his wives, son and children; the decorating\n    of the chief houses with the intestines, liver and heart of some of\n    the killed, as stated by 'Veritas' in the _West African Mail_.\n\n    \"I confirmed in general the letter published in the _West African\n    Mail_ by 'Veritas.'\n\n    \"Following this I came to Mons. Tagner's time, and stated that no\n    village in this district had escaped murders under this man's\n    _r\u00c3\u00a9gime_.\n\n    \"Next we dealt with irregularities common to all agents, calling\n    attention to and proving by specific instances the public floggings of\n    practically any and every one; quoting, for instance, seeing with my\n    own eyes six Ngombe men receive one hundred strokes each, delivered\n    simultaneously by two sentries.\n\n    \"Next, the normal condition has always been the imprisoning of men,\n    women and children, all herded together in one shed, with no\n    arrangement for the demands of nature. Further, that very many,\n    including even chiefs, had died either in prison or immediately on\n    their release.\n\n    \"Next, the mutilation of the woman Boaji, because she wished to remain\n    faithful to her husband, and refused to subject herself to the\n    passions of the sentries. The woman's footless leg and hernia testify\n    to the truth of her statement. She appeared before the Commission and\n    doctor.\n\n    \"Next, the fact that natives are imprisoned for visiting friends and\n    relatives in other villages, and the refusal to allow native canoes to\n    pass up and down river without carrying a permit signed by the rubber\n    agent; pointing out that even missionaries are subject to these\n    restrictions, and publicly insulted, in an unprintable manner, when\n    they do so.\n\n    \"Next point dealt with was responsibility--maintaining that\n    responsibility lay not so much in the individual as in the system. The\n    sentry blames the agent, he in turn the director, and so on.\n\n    \"I next called attention to the difficulties to be faced by natives in\n    reporting irregularities. The number of civil officials is too small;\n    the practical impossibility of reaching those that do exist--the\n    native having first to ask permission of the rubber agent.\n\n    \"The relations that are at present necessary between the A.B.I.R. and\n    the State render it highly improbable that the natives will ever\n    report irregularities. I then pointed out that we firmly believe that\n    but for us these irregularities would never have come to light.\n\n    \"Following on this the difficulties to be faced by missionaries were\n    dealt with, pointing out that the A.B.I.R. can and do impose on us all\n    sorts of restrictions if we dare to speak a word about their\n    irregularities. I then quoted a few of the many instances which found\n    their climax in Mrs. Harris and I almost losing our lives for daring\n    to oppose the massacres by Van Caelcken. It was also stated that we\n    could not disconnect the attitude of the State in refusing us fresh\n    sites with our action in condemning the administration. I then\n    mentioned that the forests are exhausted of rubber, pointing out that\n    during a five days' tour through the forests I did not see a single\n    vine of any size. This is solely because the vines have been worked in\n    such a manner that all the rubber roots need many years' rest, whereas\n    the natives now are actually reduced to digging up those roots in\n    order to get rubber.\n\n    \"The next subject dealt with was the clear violation both of the\n    spirit and letter of the Berlin Act. In the first place we are not\n    allowed to extend the Mission, and, further, we are forbidden to trade\n    even for food.\n\n    \"Next the statement was made that, so far as we are aware, no single\n    sentry had ever been punished by the State till 1904 for the many\n    murders committed in this district.\n\n    \"I next pointed out that one reason why the natives object to paddle\n    for the A.B.I.R. is because of the sentries who travel in the A.B.I.R.\n    canoes, and whose only business is to flog the paddlers in order to\n    keep them going.\n\n    \"After Mr. Stannard had been heard, sixteen Esanga witnesses were\n    questioned one by one. They gave clearly the details of how father,\n    mother, brother, sister, son or daughter were killed in cold blood for\n    rubber. These sixteen represented over twenty murders in Esanga alone.\n    Then followed the big chief of all Bolima, who succeeded Isekifasu\n    (murdered by the A.B.I.R.). What a sight for those who prate about\n    lying missionaries! He stood boldly before all, pointed to his twenty\n    witnesses, placed on the table his one hundred and ten twigs, each\n    twig representing a life for rubber. 'These are chiefs' twigs, these\n    are men's, these shorter are women's, these smaller still are\n    children's.' He gives the names of scores, but begs for permission to\n    call his son as a reminder. The Commission, though, is satisfied with\n    him, that he is telling the truth, and therefore say that it is\n    unnecessary. He tells how his beard of many years' growth, and which\n    nearly reached his feet, was cut off by a rubber agent, merely because\n    he visited a friend in another town. Asked if he had not killed\n    A.B.I.R. sentries, he denied it, but owned to his people spearing\n    three of the sentry's boys. He tells how the white man fought him, and\n    when the fight was over handed him his corpses, and said: 'Now you\n    will bring rubber, won't you?' To which he replied: 'Yes.' The corpses\n    were cut up and eaten by Mons. Forcie's fighters. He also told how he\n    had been chicotted and imprisoned by the A.B.I.R. agent, and further\n    put to the most menial labour by the agent.\n\n    \"Here Bonkoko came forward and told how he accompanied the A.B.I.R.\n    sentries when they went to murder Isekifasu and his wives and little\n    ones; of finding them peacefully sitting at their evening meal; of the\n    killing as many as they could, also the cutting up and eating of the\n    bodies of Isekifasu's son and his father's wives; of how they dashed\n    the baby's brains out, cut the body in half, and impaled the halves.\n\n    \"Again he tells how, on their return, Mons. Forcie had the sentries\n    chicotted because they had not killed enough of the Bolima people.\n\n    \"Next came Bongwalanga, and confirmed Bonkoko's story; this youth went\n    to 'look on.' After this the mutilated wife of Lomboto, of Ekerongo,\n    was carried by a chief, who showed her footless leg and hernia. This\n    was the price she had to pay for remaining faithful to her husband.\n    The husband told how he was chicotted because he was angry about his\n    wife's mutilation.\n\n    \"Then Longoi, of Lotoko, placed eighteen twigs on the table,\n    representing eighteen men, women and children murdered for rubber.\n    Next, Inunga laid thirty-four twigs on the table and told how\n    thirty-four of his men, women and children had been murdered at\n    Ekerongo. He admits that they had speared one sentry, Iloko, but that,\n    as in every other such instance, was because Iloko had first killed\n    their people. Lomboto shows his mutilated wrist and useless hand,\n    done by the sentry. Isekansu shows his stump of a forearm, telling the\n    same pitiful story. Every witness tells of floggings, rape,\n    mutilations, murders, and of imprisonments of men, women and children,\n    and of illegal fines and irregular taxes, etc., etc. The Commission\n    endeavours to get through this slough of iniquity and river of blood,\n    but finding it hopeless, asks how much longer I can go on. I tell them\n    I can go on until they are satisfied that hundreds of murders have\n    been committed by the A.B.I.R. in this district alone; murders of\n    chiefs, men, women and little children, and that multitudes of\n    witnesses only await my signal to appear by the thousand.\n\n    \"I further point out that we have only considered about two hundred\n    murders from the villages of Bolima, Esanga, Ekerongo, Lotoko; that by\n    far the greater majority still remain. The following districts are as\n    yet untouched: Bokri, Nson-go, Boru-ga, Ekala, Baringa, Linza,\n    Lifindu, Nsongo-Mboyo, Livoku, Boendo, the Lomako river, the Ngombe\n    country, and many others, all of whom have the same tale to tell.\n    Every one saw the hopelessness of trying to investigate things fully.\n    To do so, the Commission would have to stay here for months.\"\n\nWhat comment can be added to such evidence as this! It stands in its naked\nhorror, and it is futile to try to make it more vivid. What can any of\nthose English apologists of the Congo who have thrown a doubt upon the\naccounts of outrages because in passing through a section of this huge\ncountry upon a flying visit they had not happened to see them--what can\nLord Mountmorris, Captain Boyd Alexander, or Mrs. French Sheldon say in\nthe face of a mass of evidence with the actual mutilated limbs and\nexcoriated backs to enforce it? Can they say more than the man actually\nincriminated, M. Le Jeune, the chief agent at the spot? \"What have you to\nsay?\" asked the President. M. Le Jeune shrugged his shoulders. He had\nnothing to say. The President, who had listened, to his honour be it\nspoken, with tears running down his cheeks to some of the evidence, cried\nout in amazement and disgust. \"There is one document I would put in,\" said\nthe agent. \"It is to show that 142 of my sentinels were slain by the\nvillagers in the course of seven months.\" \"Surely that makes the matter\nworse!\" cried the sagacious judge. \"If these well-armed men were slain by\nthe defenceless villagers, how terrible must the wrongs have been which\ncalled for such desperate reprisals!\"\n\nYou will ask what was done with this criminal agent, a man whose deeds\nmerited the heaviest punishment that human law could bestow. Nothing\nwhatever was done to him. He was allowed to slip out of the country\nexactly as Captain Lothaire, in similar circumstances, was allowed to slip\nfrom the country. An insignificant agent may be occasionally made an\nexample of, but to punish the local manager of a great company would be to\nlessen the output of rubber, and what are morality and justice compared to\nthat?\n\nWhy should one continue with the testimony given before the Commission?\nTheir wanderings covered a little space of the country and were confined\nto the main river, but everywhere they elicited the same tale of slavery,\nmutilation, and murder. What Scrivener and Grenfell said at Bolobo was\nwhat Harris and Stannard said at Baringa, what Gilchrist said at Lulanga,\nwhat Rushin and Gamman said at Bongadanga, what Mr. and Mrs. Lower said at\nIkan, what Padfield said at Bonginda, what Weeks said at Monscombe. The\nplace varied, but the results of the system were ever the same. Here and\nthere were human touches which lingered in the memory; here and there also\nepisodes of horror which stood out even in that universal Golgotha. One\nlad testified that he had lost every relative in the world, male or\nfemale, all murdered for rubber. As his father lay dying he had given him\nthe charge of two infant brothers and enjoined him to guard them tenderly.\nHe had cared for them until he had been compelled at last to go himself\ninto the forest to gather the rubber. One week their quantity had been\nshort. When he returned from the wood the village had been raided in his\nabsence, and he found his two little brothers lying disembowelled across a\nlog. The company, however, paid 200 per cent.\n\nFour natives had been tortured until they cried out for some one to bring\na gun and shoot them.\n\nThe chiefs died because their hearts were broken.\n\nMr. Gamman knew no village where it took them less than ten days out of\nfifteen to satisfy the demands of the A.B.I.R. As a rule, the people had\nfour days in a month to themselves. By law the maximum of forced labour\nwas forty hours in a month. But, as I have said, there is no relation at\nall between law and practice in the Congo.\n\nOne witness appeared with a string knotted in forty-two places, and with a\npacket of fifty leaves. Each knot represented a murder and each leaf a\nrope in his native village.\n\nThe son of a murdered chief took the body of his father (all names, dates\nand place specified) to show it to the white agent, in the hope of\njustice. The agent called his dog and set it on him, the dog biting the\nson on the leg as he carried the corpse of his father.\n\nThe villagers brought their murdered men to M. Spelier, director of the La\nLulanga Company. He accused them of lying and ordered them off.\n\nOne chief was seized by two white agents, one of whom held him while the\nother beat him. When they had finished they kicked him to make him get up,\nbut the man was dead. The Commission examined ten witnesses in their\ninvestigation of this story. The chief was Jonghi, the village Bogeka, the\ndate October, 1904.\n\nSuch is a fractional sample of the evidence which was laid before the\nCommission, corroborated by every detail of name, place and date which\ncould enforce conviction. There is no doubt that it did enforce thorough\nconviction. The judges travelled down the river sadder and wiser men. When\nthey reached Boma, they had an interview with Governor-General\nConstermann. What passed at that interview has not been published, but the\nGovernor-General went forth from it and cut his own throat. The fact may,\nperhaps, give some indication of how the judges felt when the stories were\nstill fresh in their minds, and their nerves wincing under the horror of\nthe evidence.\n\nA whole year elapsed between the starting of the Commission and the\npresentation of their Report, which was published upon October 31st, 1905.\nThe evidence which would have stirred Europe to its foundations was never\npublished at all, in spite of an informal assurance to Lord Lansdowne that\nnothing would be held back. Only the conclusions saw the light, without\nthe document upon which they were founded.\n\nThe effect of that Report, when stripped of its courtly phrases, was an\nabsolute confirmation of all that had been said by so many witnesses\nduring so many years. It is easy to blame the Commissioners for not having\nthe full courage of their convictions, but their position was full of\ndifficulty. The Report was really a personal one. The State was, as no one\nknew better than themselves, a fiction. It was the King who had sent them,\nand it was to the King himself that they were reporting upon a matter\nwhich deeply affected his personal honour as well as his material\ninterests. Had they been, as had been suggested, an international body,\nthe matter would have been simple. But of the three good care had been\ntaken that two should be men who would have to answer for what was said.\nMr. Janssens was a more or less independent man, but a Belgian, and a\nsubject all the same. Baron Nisco was in the actual employ of the King,\nand his future was at stake. On the whole, I think that the Commissioners\nacted like brave and honest men.\n\nNaturally they laid all stress upon what could be said in favour of the\nKing and his creation. They would have been more than human had they not\ndone so. They enlarged upon the size and the traffic of the cities at the\nmouth of the Congo--as if the whole loot of a nation could pass down a\nriver without causing commerce and riches at its mouth. Very early in the\nReport they indicated that the question of the State appropriation of the\nland had forced itself upon their notice. \"If the State wishes to avoid\nthe principle of the State appropriation of vacant lands resulting in\nabuse,\" says the Report, \"it should place its agents and officials on\ntheir guard against too restrictive interpretation and too rigorous\napplications.\" Weak and trimming, it is true, but it was the cornerstone\nof all that the King had built, and how were they to knock it rudely out?\nTheir attitude was not heroic. But it was natural. They go on:\n\n    \"As the greater portion of the land in the Congo is not under\n    cultivation, this interpretation concedes to the State A RIGHT OF\n    ABSOLUTE AND EXCLUSIVE OWNERSHIP OVER VIRTUALLY THE WHOLE OF THE LAND,\n    WITH THIS CONSEQUENCE: THAT IT CAN DISPOSE--ITSELF AND SOLELY--OF ALL\n    THE PRODUCTS OF THE SOIL; PROSECUTE AS A POACHER ANY ONE WHO TAKES\n    FROM THAT LAND THE LEAST OF ITS FRUITS, OR AS A RECEIVER OF STOLEN\n    GOODS ANY ONE WHO RECEIVES SUCH FRUIT: FORBID ANY ONE TO ESTABLISH\n    HIMSELF ON THE GREATER PART OF THE TERRITORY. THE ACTIVITY OF THE\n    NATIVES IS THUS LIMITED TO VERY RESTRICTED AREAS, AND THEIR ECONOMIC\n    CONDITION IS IMMOBILIZED. THUS ABUSIVELY APPLIED, SUCH LEGISLATION\n    WOULD PREVENT ANY DEVELOPMENT OF NATIVE LIFE. IN THIS MANNER, NOT ONLY\n    HAS THE NATIVE BEEN OFTEN FORBIDDEN TO SHIFT HIS VILLAGE, BUT HE HAS\n    EVEN BEEN FORBIDDEN TO VISIT, EVEN TEMPORARILY, A NEIGHBOURING VILLAGE\n    WITHOUT SPECIAL PERMIT. A NATIVE DISPLACING HIMSELF WITHOUT BEING THE\n    BEARER OF SUCH AN AUTHORIZATION, WOULD LEAVE HIMSELF OPEN TO ARREST,\n    TO BE TAKEN BACK AND EVEN PUNISHED.\"\n\nWho could possibly deny, after reading this passage, that the Congo native\nhas been reduced from freedom into slavery? There follows a curious\nsentence:\n\n    \"Let us hasten,\" says the Report, \"to say that in actual fact so great\n    a rigour has not been shown. Almost everywhere certain PRODUCTS OF THE\n    DOMAIN have been abandoned to the natives, notably palm kernels, which\n    form the object of an important export trade in the Lower Congo.\"\n\nThis palm kernel trade is an old-established one, affecting only the mouth\nof the river, which could not be disturbed without obvious international\ncomplications, and which bears no relation to the great Upper Congo\npopulations, whose inhuman treatment was the question at issue.\n\nThe Report then proceeds to point out very clearly, the all-important fact\nwhich arises from the expropriation of the native from the land. \"Apart\nfrom the rough plantations,\" it says, \"which barely suffice, to feed the\nnatives themselves and to supply the stations, all the fruits of the soil\nare considered as the property of the State or of the Concessionnaire\nsocieties.\" This being so, there is an end forever of free trade, or,\nindeed, of any trade, save an export by the Government itself, or by a\nhandful of companies which really represent the Government, of the whole\nwealth of the country to Europe for the benefit of a ring of millionaires.\n\nHaving dealt with the taking of the land and the taking of its products,\nthe Commission handles with kid gloves the third great root proposition,\nthe forcing of the natives, for nothing, under the name of taxes, for\ntrifles under the absurd name of trade, to work for the sake of their\noppressors. It expends many words in showing that natives do not like\nwork, and that, therefore, compulsion is necessary. It is sad to see just\nand learned men driven to such straits in defending what is indefensible.\nDo the blacks of the Rand gold mines like work? Do the Kimberley diamond\nhunters like work? Do the carriers of an East German caravan like work? No\nmore than the Congolese. Why, then, do they work? Because they are paid a\nfair wage to do so. Because the money earned by their work can bring them\nmore pleasure than the work does pain. That is the law of work the whole\nworld over. Notably it is the law on the Congo itself, where the\nmissionaries, who pay honestly for work, have no difficulty in getting it.\nOf course, the Congolese, like the Englishman, or the Belgian, does not\nlike work when it is work which brings a benefit to others and none to\nhimself.\n\nBut in spite of this preamble, the Commission cannot escape the actual\nfacts.\n\n    \"Numbers of agents only thought of one thing: to obtain as MUCH AS\n    POSSIBLE IN THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME, and their demands were often\n    excessive. This IS NOT AT ALL ASTONISHING, AT ANY RATE AS REGARDS THE\n    GATHERING OF THE PRODUCE OF THE DOMAIN....\n\n    that is to say, the revenues for Government;\n\n    FOR THE AGENTS THEMSELVES WHO REGULATED THE TAX AND SAW TO ITS\n    COLLECTION, HAD A DIRECT INTEREST IN INCREASING ITS AMOUNT, SINCE THEY\n    RECEIVED PROPORTIONAL BONUSES ON THE PRODUCE THUS COLLECTED.\"\n\nNo more definite statement could be made of the system which had been\nattacked by the Reformers and denied by the Congo officials for so many\nyears. The Report then goes on to tell that when the State, in one of\nthose pretended reforms which were meant for European, not for Congolese,\nuse, allotted forty hours of forced labour per month as the amount which\nthe native owed the State, the announcement was accompanied by a private\nintimation from the Governor-General to the District Commissioners, dated\nFebruary 23rd, 1904, that this new law must have the effect, not of\nlessening, but \"of bringing about a constant increase in the resources of\nthe Treasury.\" Could they be told in plainer terms that they were to\ndisregard it?\n\nThe land is taken, the produce is taken, the labour is taken. In old days\nthe African slave was exported, but we progress with the ages and now a\nhigher intelligence has shown the folly of the old-fashioned methods when\nit is to easy to enslave him in his own home.\n\nWe may pass the Report of the Commission in so far as it deals with the\ntaxation of the natives, food taxes, porterage taxes and other imposts. It\nbrings out very clearly the curse of the parasitic army, with their\nfamilies, which have to be fed by the natives, and the difficulty which it\ncauses them with their limited plantations to find the means for feeding\nthemselves. Even the wood to the State steamers is not paid for, but is\ntaken as a tax. Such demands \"force the natives in the neighbourhood of\nthe stations in certain cases to an almost continuous labour\"--a fresh\nadmission of slave conditions. The Report describes the result of the\nrubber tax in the following terms:\n\n    \"This circumstance [exhaustion of the rubber] explains the repugnance\n    of the native for rubber work, which in itself is not particularly\n    painful. In THE MAJORITY OF CASES the native must go one or two days'\n    march EVERY FORTNIGHT, until he arrives at that part of the forest\n    where the rubber vines can be met with in a certain degree of\n    abundance. There the collector passes a number of days IN A MISERABLE\n    EXISTENCE. HE HAS TO BUILD HIMSELF AN IMPROVISED SHELTER, WHICH\n    CANNOT, OBVIOUSLY, REPLACE HIS HUT. HE HAS NOT THE FOOD TO WHICH HE IS\n    ACCUSTOMED. HE IS DEPRIVED OF HIS WIFE, EXPOSED TO THE INCLEMENCIES OF\n    THE WEATHER AND THE ATTACKS OF WILD BEASTS. WHEN ONCE HE HAS COLLECTED\n    THE RUBBER HE MUST BRING IT TO THE STATE STATION OR TO THAT OF THE\n    COMPANY, AND ONLY THEN CAN HE RETURN TO HIS VILLAGE, WHERE HE CAN\n    SOJOURN FOR BARELY MORE THAN TWO OR THREE DAYS, BECAUSE THE NEXT\n    DEMAND IS UPON HIM.... It is hardly necessary to add that this state\n    of affairs is A FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF THE FORTY HOURS' LAW.\"\n\nThe Report deals finally with the question of the punishments meted out by\nthe State. These it enumerates as \"the taking of hostages, the\nimprisonment of the chiefs, the institution of sentries or capitas, fines\nand military expeditions,\" the latter being a euphemism for cold-blooded\nmassacres. It continues:\n\n    \"Whatever one may think of native ideas, acts such as taking women as\n    hostages outrage too much our ideas of justice to be tolerated. The\n    State has prohibited this practice long ago, but without being able to\n    suppress it.\"\n\nThe State prohibits, but the State not only condones, but actually\ncommands it by private circular. Again the gap which lies betwixt law and\nfact where the interest of gain is concerned.\n\n    \"It was barely denied,\" the Report continues, \"that in the various\n    posts of the A.B.I.R. which we visited, the imprisonment of women\n    hostages, the subjection of the chiefs to servile labour, the\n    humiliations meted out to them, the flogging of rubber collectors, the\n    brutality of the black employ\u00c3\u00a9s set over the prisoners, were the rule\n    commonly followed.\"\n\nThen follows an illuminative passage about the sentries, capitas or\n\"forest guards,\" or messengers, as they are alternatively called. It is a\nwonder that they were not called hospital orderlies in the efforts to make\nthem seem inoffensive. What they actually were was, as we have seen, some\ntwenty thousand cannibals armed with Albini repeating rifles. The Report\nsays:\n\n    \"This system of native supervisors (_surveillants_) has given rise to\n    numerous criticisms, even on the part of State officials. The\n    Protestant missionaries heard at Bolobo, Ikoko (Lake Mantumba),\n    Lulonga, Bonginda, Ikau, Baringa and Bongandanga, drew up formidable\n    accusations against the acts of these intermediaries. They brought\n    before the Commission a MULTITUDE OF NATIVE WITNESSES, WHO REVEALED A\n    LARGE NUMBER OF CRIMES and excesses alleged to have been committed by\n    the sentinels. According to the witnesses these auxiliaries,\n    especially those stationed in the villages, abuse the authority\n    conferred upon them, convert themselves into DESPOTS, CLAIMING THE\n    WOMEN AND THE FOOD, NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR THE BODY OF\n    PARASITES AND CREATURES WITHOUT ANY CALLING WHICH A LOVE OF RAPINE\n    CAUSES TO BECOME ASSOCIATED WITH THEM, AND WITH WHOM THEY SURROUND\n    THEMSELVES AS WITH A VERITABLE BODYGUARD; THEY KILL WITHOUT PITY ALL\n    THOSE WHO ATTEMPT TO RESIST THEIR EXIGENCIES AND WHIMS. The Commission\n    was obviously unable in all cases to verify the exactitude of the\n    allegations made before it, the more so that the facts were often\n    several years old. However, TRUTH OF THE CHARGES IS BORNE OUT BY A\n    MASS OF EVIDENCE AND OFFICIAL REPORTS.\"\n\nIt adds:\n\n    \"OF HOW MANY ABUSES HAVE THESE NATIVE SENTINELS BEEN GUILTY IT WOULD\n    BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY, EVEN APPROXIMATELY. SEVERAL CHIEFS OF BARINGA\n    BROUGHT US, ACCORDING TO THE NATIVE CUSTOM, BUNDLES OF STICKS, EACH OF\n    WHICH WAS MEANT TO SHOW ONE OF THEIR SUBJECTS KILLED BY THE CAPITAS.\n    ONE OF THEM SHOWED 120 MURDERS IN HIS VILLAGE COMMITTED DURING THE\n    LAST FEW YEARS. Whatever one may think of the confidence with which\n    this native form of book-keeping may inspire one, a document handed to\n    the Commission by the Director of the A.B.I.R. does not allow any\n    doubt to remain as to the sinister character of the system. It\n    consisted of a list showing that from 1st January to 1st August,\n    1905--that is to say, within a space of seven months--142 sentries of\n    the Society had been killed or wounded by the natives. Now, it is to\n    be assumed that in many cases these sentries had been attacked by the\n    natives by way of revenge. One may judge by this of the number of\n    bloody affrays to which their presence had given rise. ON THE OTHER\n    HAND, THE AGENTS INTERROGATED BY THE COMMISSION, OR WHO WERE PRESENT\n    AT THE AUDIENCES, DID NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO DENY THE CHARGES BROUGHT\n    AGAINST THE SENTINELS.\"\n\nThat last sentence seems the crown of the arch. If the agents on the spot\ndid not attempt before the Commission to deny the outrages who shall\nventure to do it in their name?\n\nThe remainder of the Report, though stuffed with courtly platitudes and\nwith vague recommendations of reform which are absolutely unpractical, so\nlong as the root causes of all the trouble remain undisturbed, contains a\nfew positive passages which are worth preserving. Talking of the want of\ndefinite instructions to military expeditions, it says:\n\n    \"The consequences are often very murderous. And one must not be\n    astonished. If in the course of THESE DELICATE OPERATIONS, WHOSE\n    OBJECT IT IS TO SEIZE HOSTAGES AND TO INTIMIDATE THE NATIVES, constant\n    watch cannot be exercised over the sanguinary instincts of the\n    soldiers when orders to punish are given by superior authority, it is\n    difficult that the expedition should not degenerate into massacres,\n    accompanied by pillage and incendiarism.\"\n\nAgain:\n\n    \"The responsibility for these abuses must not, however, always be\n    placed upon the commanders of military expeditions. In considering\n    these facts one must bear in mind the deplorable confusion still\n    existing in the Upper Congo between a state of war and a state of\n    peace; between administration and repression; between those who may be\n    regarded as enemies and those who have the right to be regarded as\n    citizens of the State and treated in accordance with its laws. The\n    Commission was struck with the general tone of the reports relating to\n    operations described above. Often, while admitting that the expedition\n    had been sent out SOLELY FOR SHORTAGE IN TAXATION, AND WITHOUT MAKING\n    ALLUSION TO AN ATTACK OR RESISTANCE ON THE PART OF THE NATIVES, WHICH\n    ALONE WOULD JUSTIFY THE USE OF ARMS, the authors of these reports\n    speak of 'SURPRISING VILLAGES,' 'ENERGETIC PURSUIT,' 'NUMEROUS ENEMIES\n    KILLED AND WOUNDED,' 'LOOT,' 'PRISONERS OF WAR,' 'CONDITIONS OF\n    PEACE.' Evidently these officers thought themselves at war, acted as\n    though at war.\"\n\nAgain:\n\n    \"The course of such expeditions grave abuses have occurred; men, women\n    and children have BEEN KILLED EVEN AT THE VERY TIME THEY SOUGHT SAFETY\n    IN FLIGHT. OTHERS HAVE BEEN IMPRISONED. WOMEN HAVE BEEN TAKEN AS\n    HOSTAGES.\"\n\nThere is an interesting passage about the missionaries:\n\n    \"Often also, in the regions where evangelical stations are\n    established, the native, instead of going to the magistrate, his\n    natural protector, adopts the habit when he thinks he has a grievance\n    against an agent or an Executive officer, to confide in the\n    missionary. The latter listens to him, helps him according to his\n    means, and makes himself the echo of all the complaints of a region.\n    Hence the astounding influence which the missionaries possess in some\n    parts of the territory. It exercises itself not only among the natives\n    within the purview of their religious propaganda, but over all the\n    villages whose troubles they have listened to. The missionary becomes,\n    for the native of the region, the only representative of equity and\n    justice; he adds to the ascendancy acquired from his religious zeal,\n    the prestige which, in the interest of the State itself, should be\n    invested in the magistrates.\"\n\nI will now turn for a moment to contemplate the document as a whole.\n\nWith the characteristic policy of the Congo authorities, it was originally\ngiven to the world as being a triumphant vindication of King Leopold's\nadministration, which would certainly have been the greatest whitewashing\ncontract ever yet carried through upon this planet. Looked at more\nclosely, it is clearly seen that behind the veil of courtly phrase and\ncomplimentary forms, every single thing that the Reformers have been\nclaiming has been absolutely established. That the land has been taken.\nThat the produce has been taken. That the people are enslaved. That they\nare reduced to misery. That the white agents have given the capitas a free\nhand against them. That there have been illegal holdings of hostages,\npredatory expeditions, murders and mutilations. All these things are\nabsolutely admitted. I do not know that anything more has ever been\nclaimed, save that the Commission talks coldly of what a private man must\ntalk of hotly, and that the Commission might give the impression that they\nwere isolated acts, whereas the evidence here given and the general\ndepopulation of the country show that they are general, universal, and\nparts of a single system extending from Leopoldville to the Great Lakes,\nand from the French border to Katanga. Be it private domain, crown domain,\nor Concessionnaire territory, be it land of the Kasai, the Anversoise, the\nAbir, or the Katanga companies, the tale still tells of bloodshed and\nhorror.\n\nWhere the Commission differs from the Reformers is in their estimate of\nthe gravity of this situation and of the need of absolute radical reforms.\nIt is to be borne in mind that of the three judges two had never been in\nAfrica before, while the third was a direct servant of the attacked\ninstitution. They seem to have vaguely felt that these terrible facts were\nnecessary phases of Colonial expansion. Had they travelled, as I have\ndone, in British West Africa, and had it been brought home to them that a\nblow to a black man, Sierra Leone, for example, would mean that one would\nbe taken by a black policeman before a black judge to be handed over to a\nblack gaoler, they would understand that there are other methods of\nadministration. Had they ever read of that British Governor of Jamaica,\nwho, having in the face of dangerous revolt, executed a Negro without due\nforms of law, was recalled to London, tried, and barely escaped with his\nlife. It is by such tension as this that Europeans in the Tropics,\nwhatever be their nation, must be braced up to maintain their civilized\n_morale_. Human nature is weak, the influence of environment is strong.\nGermans or English would yield and in isolated cases have yielded, to\ntheir surroundings. No nation can claim much individual superiority in\nsuch a matter. But for both Germany and England (I would add France, were\nit not for the French Congo) can claim that their system works as strongly\nagainst outrage as the Belgian one does in favour of it. These things are\nnot, as the Commissioners seemed to think, necessary evils, which are\ntolerated elsewhere. How can their raw opinion weigh for a moment upon\nsuch a point when it is counterbalanced by the words of such Reformers as\nSir Harry Johnston or Lord Cromer? The fact is that the running of a\ntropical colony is, of all tests, the most searching as to the\ndevelopment of the nation which attempts it; to see helpless people and\nnot to oppress them, to see great wealth and not to confiscate it, to have\nabsolute power and not to abuse it, to raise the native instead of sinking\nyourself--these are the supreme trials of a nation's spirit. We have all\nfailed at times. But never has there been failure so hopeless, so\nshocking, bearing such consequences to the world, such degradation to the\ngood name of Christianity and civilization as the failure of the Belgians\nin the Congo.\n\nAnd all this has happened and all this has been tolerated in an age of\nprogress. The greatest, deepest, most wide-reaching crime of which there\nis any record, has been reserved for these latter years. Some excuse there\nis for racial extermination where, as with Saxons and Celts, two peoples\ncontend for the same land which will but hold one. Some excuse, too, for\nreligious massacre when, like Mahomet the Second at Constantinople, or\nAlva in the Lowlands, the bigoted murderers honestly conceived that their\nbrutal work was in the interest of God. But here the real doers have sat\nremote with cold blood in their veins, knowing well from day to day what\nthey were doing, and with the sole object of adding more to wealth which\nwas already enormous. Consider this circumstance and consider also the\nprofessions of philanthropy with which the huge massacre was inaugurated,\nthe cloud of lies with which it has been screened, the persecution and\ncalumny of the few honest men who uncovered it, the turning of religion\nagainst religion and of nation against nation in the attempt to perpetuate\nit, and having weighed all this, tell me where in the course of history\nthere is any such story. What is progress? Is it to run a little faster in\na motor-car, to listen to gabble in a gramophone?--these are the toys of\nlife. But if progress is a spiritual thing, then we do _not_ progress.\nSuch a horror as this of Belgium and the Congo would not have been\npossible fifty years ago. No European nation would have done it, and if it\nhad, no other one would have failed to raise its voice in protest. There\nwas more decorum and principle in life in those slower days. We live in a\ntime of rush, but do not call it progress. The story of the Congo has made\nthe idea a little absurd.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nTHE CONGO AFTER THE COMMISSION\n\n\nThe high hopes which the advent of the Commission raised among the natives\nand the few Europeans who had acted as their champions, were soon turned\nto bitter disappointment. The indefatigable Mr. Harris had sent on after\nthe Commission a number of fresh cases which had come to his notice. In\none of these a chief deposed that he had been held back in his village\n(Boendo) in order to prevent him from reaching the Commission. He\nsucceeded in breaking away from his guards, but was punished for his\nenterprise by having his wife clubbed to death by a sentry. He brought\nwith him, in the hope that he might lay them before the judges, one\nhundred and eighty-two long twigs and seventy-six smaller ones, to\nrepresent so many adults and children who had been murdered by the\nA.B.I.R. Company in his district during the last few years. His account of\nthe methods by which these unfortunate people met their deaths will not\nbear printing. The wildest dreams of the Inquisition were outdone. Women\nhad been killed by thrusting stakes into them from below. When the\nhorrified missionary asked the chief if this was personally known to him,\nhis answer was, \"They killed my daughter, Nsinga, in this manner; I found\nthe stake in her.\" And a reputable Belgian statesman can write in this\nyear of grace that they are carrying on the beneficent and philanthropic\nmission which has been handed down to them.\n\nIn a later communication Mr. Harris gives the names of men, women and\nchildren killed by the sentries of a M. Pilaet.\n\n    \"Last year,\" he says, \"or the year before, the young woman, Imenega,\n    was tied to a forked tree and chopped in half with a hatchet,\n    beginning at the left shoulder, chopping down through the chest and\n    abdomen and out at the side.\" Again, with every detail of name and\n    place, he dwelt upon the horrible fact that public incest had been\n    enforced by the sentries--brother with sister, and father with\n    daughter. \"Oh, Inglesia,\" cried the chief in conclusion, \"don't stay\n    away long; if you do, they will come, I am sure they will come, and\n    then these enfeebled legs will not support me, I cannot run away. I am\n    near my end; try and see to it that they let me die in peace; don't\n    stay away.\"\n\n    \"I was so moved, your Excellency, at these people's story that I took\n    the liberty of promising them, in the name of the Congo Free State,\n    that you will only kill them in future for crimes. I told them the\n    Inspector Royal was, I hoped, on his way, and that I was sure he would\n    listen to their story, and give them time to recover themselves.\"\n\nIt is terrible to think that such a promise, through no fault of Mr.\nHarris, has not been fulfilled. Are the dreams of the Commissioners never\nhaunted by the thought of those who put such trust in them, but whose only\nreward has been that they have been punished for the evidence they gave\nand that their condition has been more miserable than ever. The final\npractical result of the Commission was that upon the natives, and not upon\ntheir murderers, came the punishment.\n\nM. Malfeyt, a Royal High Commissioner, had been sent out on pretence of\nreform. How hollow was this pretence may be seen from the fact that at the\nsame time M. Wahis had been despatched as Governor-General in place of\nthat Constermann who had committed suicide after his interview with the\njudges of the Commission. Wahis had already served two terms as Governor,\nand it was under his administration that all the abuses the Commission had\ncondemned had actually grown up. Could King Leopold have shown more\nclearly how far any real reform was from his mind?\n\nM. Malfeyt's visit had been held up as a step toward improvement. The\nBritish Government had been assured that his visit would be of a nature to\neffect all necessary reforms. On arriving in the country, however, he\nannounced that he had no power to act, and only came to see and hear. Thus\na few more months were gained before any change could be effected. The\nonly small consolation which we can draw from all this succession of\nimpotent ambassadors and reforming committees, which do not, and were\nnever intended to, reform, is that the game has been played and exposed,\nand surely cannot be played again. A Government would deservedly be the\nlaughing-stock of the world which again accepted assurances from the same\nsource.\n\nWhat, in the meanwhile, was the attitude of that A.B.I.R. Company, whose\niniquities had been thoroughly exposed before the Commission, and whose\nmanager M. Le Jeune, had fled to Europe? Was it ashamed of its\nbloodthirsty deeds? Was it prepared in any way to modify its policy after\nthe revelations which its representatives had admitted to be true? Read\nthe following interview which Mr. Stannard had with M. Delvaux, who had\nvisited the stations of his disgraced colleague:\n\n    \"He spoke of the Commission of Inquiry in a contemptuous manner, and\n    showed considerable annoyance about the things we had said to the\n    Commission. He declared the A.B.I.R. had full authority and power to\n    send out armed sentries, and force the people to bring in rubber, and\n    to imprison those who did not. A short time ago, the natives of a town\n    brought in some rubber to the agent here, but he refused it because it\n    was not enough, and the men were thrashed by the A.B.I.R. employees,\n    and driven away. The director justified the agent in refusing the\n    rubber because the quantity was too small. The Commissioners had\n    declared that the A.B.I.R. had no power to send armed sentries into\n    the towns in order to flog the people and drive them into the forests\n    to seek rubber; they were 'guards of the forest,' and that was their\n    work. When we pointed this out to M. Delvaux, he pooh-poohed the idea,\n    and said the name had no significance; some called the sentries by one\n    name, some by another. We pointed out that the people were not\n    compelled to pay their taxes in rubber only, but could bring in other\n    things, or even currency. He denied this, and said that the\n    alternative tax only meant that an agent could impose whatever tax he\n    thought fit. It had no reference whatever to the natives. The A.B.I.R.\n    preferred the taxes to be paid in rubber. This is what the A.B.I.R.\n    says, in spite of the interpretation by Baron Nisco, the highest\n    judicial authority in the State, that the natives could pay their\n    taxes in what they were best able. All these things were said in the\n    presence of the Royal High Commissioner, who, whether he approved or\n    not, certainly did not contradict or protest against them.\"\n\nWithin a week or two of the departure of the Commission the state of the\ncountry was as bad as ever. It cannot be too often repeated that it was\nnot local in its origin, but that it occurred there, as elsewhere, on\naccount of pressure from the central officials. If further proof were\nneeded of this it is to be found in the Van Caelchen trial. This agent,\nhaving been arrested, succeeded in showing (as was done in the Caudron\ncase) that the real guilt lay with his superior officers. In his defence\nhe\n\n    \"Bases his power on a letter of the Commissaire-G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral de Bauw (the\n    Supreme Executive Officer in the District), and in a circular\n    transmitted to him by his director, and signed 'Constermann'\n    (Governor-General), which he read to the Court, deploring the\n    diminished output in rubber, and saying that the agents of the\n    A.B.I.R. should not forget that they had the same powers of\n    '_contrainte par corps_' (bodily detention) as were delegated to the\n    agent of the Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 Commerciale Anversoise au Congo for the increase\n    of rubber production; that if the Governor-General or his\n    Commissaire-G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral did not know what they were writing and what they\n    signed, he knows what orders he had to obey; it was not for him to\n    question the legality or illegality of these orders; his superiors\n    ought to have known and have weighed what they wrote before giving him\n    orders to execute; that bodily detention of natives for rubber was no\n    secret, seeing that at the end of every month a statement of\n    '_contrainte par corps_' (bodily detention) during the month has to be\n    furnished in duplicate, the book signed, and one of the copies\n    transmitted to the Government.\"\n\nWhilst these organized outrages were continuing in the Congo, King\nLeopold, at Belgium, had taken a fresh step, which, in its cynical\ndisregard for any attempt at consistency, surpassed any of his previous\nperformances. Feeling that something must be done in the face of the\nfinding of his own delegates, he appointed a fresh Commission, whose terms\nof reference were \"to study the conclusions of the Commission of Inquiry,\nto formulate the proposals they call for, and to seek for practical means\nfor realizing them.\" It is worth while to enumerate the names of the men\nchosen for this work. Had a European Areopagus called before it the head\ncriminals of this terrible business, all of these men, with the exception\nof two or three, would have been standing in the dock. Take their names in\nturn: Van Maldeghem, the President--a jurist, who had written on Congo\nlaw, but had no direct complicity in the crimes; Janssens, the President\nof the former Commission, a man of integrity; M. Davignon, a Belgian\npolitician--so far the selection is a possible one--now listen to the\nothers! De Cuvelier, creature of the King, and responsible for the Congo\nhorrors; Droogmans, creature of the King, administrator of the secret\nfunds derived from his African estates, and himself President of a Rubber\nTrust; Arnold, creature of the King; Liebrechts, the same; Gohr, the same;\nChenot, a Congo Commissioner; Tombeur, the same; Fiv\u00c3\u00a9, a Congo inspector;\nNys, the chief legal upholder of the King's system; De Hemptinne,\nPresident of the Kasai Rubber Trust; Mobs, an Administrator of the\nA.B.I.R. Is it not evident that, save the first three, these were the very\nmen who were on their trial? The whole appointment is an example of that\ncynical humour which gives a grotesque touch to this inconceivable story.\nIt need not be added that no result making for reform ever came from such\nan assembly. One can but rejoice that the presence of the small humane\nminority may have prevented the others from devising some fresh methods of\noppression.\n\nIt cannot be said, however, that no judicial proceedings and no\ncondemnation arose from the actions of the Congo Commission. But who could\never guess who the man was who was dragged to the bar. On the evidence of\nnatives and missionaries, the whole white hierarchy, from Governor-General\nto subsidized cannibal, had been shown to be blood-guilty. Which of them\nwas punished? None of them, but Mr. Stannard, one of the accusing\nwitnesses. He had shown that the soldiers of a certain M. Hagstrom had\nbehaved brutally to the natives. This was the account of Lontulu the\nchief:\n\n    \"Lontulu, the senior chief of Bolima, came with twenty witnesses,\n    which was all the canoe would hold. He brought with him one hundred\n    and ten twigs, each of which represented a life sacrificed for rubber.\n    The twigs were of different lengths and represented chiefs, men, women\n    and children, according to their length. It was a horrible story of\n    massacre, mutilation and cannibalism that he had to tell, and it was\n    perfectly clear that he was telling the truth. He was further\n    supported by other eye-witnesses. These crimes were committed by those\n    who were acting under the instructions and with the knowledge of white\n    men. On one occasion the sentries were flogged because they had not\n    killed enough people. At one time, after they had killed a number of\n    people, including Isekifasu, the principal chief, his wives and\n    children, the bodies, except that of Isekifasu, were cut up, and the\n    cannibalistic fighters attached to the A.B.I.R. force were rationed on\n    the meat thus supplied. The intestines, etc., were hung up in and\n    about the house, and a little child who had been cut in halves was\n    impaled. After one attack, Lontulu, the chief, was shown the dead\n    bodies of his people, and asked by the rubber agent if he would bring\n    in rubber now. He replied that he would. Although a chief of\n    considerable standing, he has been flogged, imprisoned, tied by the\n    neck with men who were regarded as slaves, made to do the most menial\n    work, and his beard, which was of many years' growth, and reached\n    almost to the ground, was cut off by the rubber agent because he\n    visited another town.\"\n\nLontulu was cross-examined by the Commission and his evidence was not\nshaken. Here are some of the questions and answers:\n\n    \"President Janssens: 'M. Hagstrom leur a fait la guerre. Il a tu\u00c3\u00a9\n    beaucoup d'hommes avec ses soldats.'\n\n    \"To Lontulu: 'Were the people of Monji, etc., given the corpses to\n    eat?'\n\n    \"Lontulu: 'Yes, they cut them up and ate them.'\n\n    \"Baron Nisco: 'Did they flog you?'\n\n    \"Lontulu: 'Repeatedly.'\n\n    \"Baron Nisco: 'Who cut your beard off?'\n\n    \"Lontulu: 'M. Hannotte.'\n\n    \"President Janssens: 'Did you see sentries kill your people? Did they\n    kill many?'\n\n    \"Lontulu: 'Yes, all my family is finished.'\n\n    \"President: 'Give us names.'\n\n    \"Lontulu: 'Chiefs Bokomo, Isekifasu, Botamba, Longeva, Bosangi,\n    Booifa, Eongo, Lomboto, Loma, Bayolo.'\n\n    \"Then followed names of women and children and ordinary men (not\n    chiefs).\n\n    \"Lontulu: 'May I call my son lest I make a mistake?'\n\n    \"President: 'It is unnecessary; go on.'\n\n    \"Lontulu: 'Bomposa, Beanda, Ekila.'\n\n    \"President: 'Are you sure that each of your twigs (110) represents one\n    person killed?'\n\n    \"Lontulu: 'Yes.'\n\n    \"President: 'Was Isekifasu killed at this time?'\n\n    \"Reply not recorded.\n\n    \"President: 'Did you see his entrails hanging on his house?'\n\n    \"Lontulu: 'Yes.'\n\n    \"_Question_: 'Were the sentries and people who helped given the dead\n    bodies to eat?'\n\n    \"_Answer_: 'Yes, they ate them. Those who took part in the fight cut\n    them up and ate them.... He was _chicotted_ (flogged), and said, \"Why\n    do you do this? Is it right to flog a chief?\"' Gave a very full\n    account of his harsh treatment and sufferings.\"\n\nThe action was taken for criminal libel by M. Hagstrom against Mr.\nStannard, for saying that this evidence had been given before the\nCommission. Of course, the only way to establish the fact was a reference\nto the evidence itself which lay at Brussels. But as Hagstrom was only a\npuppet of the higher Government of the Congo (which means the King\nhimself), in their attempt to revenge themselves upon the missionaries it\nwas not very likely that official documents would be produced for the mere\npurpose of serving the end of Justice. The minutes then were not\nforthcoming. How, then, was Mr. Stannard to produce evidence that his\naccount was correct? Obviously by producing Lontulu, the chief. But the\nwretched Lontulu, beaten and tortured, with his beard plucked off and his\nspirit broken, had been cast into gaol before the trial, and knew well\nwhat would be his fate if he testified against his masters. He withdrew\nall that he had said at the Commission--and who can blame him? So M.\nHagstrom obtained his verdict and the Belgian reptile Press proclaimed\nthat Mr. Stannard had been proved to be a liar. He was sentenced to three\nmonths' imprisonment, with the alternative of a \u00c2\u00a340 fine. Even as I write,\ntwo more of these lion-hearted missionaries, Americans this time--Mr.\nMorrison and Mr. Shepherd--are undergoing a similar prosecution on the\nCongo. This time it is the Kasai Company which is the injured innocent.\nBut the eyes of Europe and America are on the transaction, and M.\nVandervelde, the fearless Belgian advocate of liberty, has set forth to\nact for the accused. What M. Labori was to Dreyfus, M. Vandervelde has\nbeen to the Congo, save that it is a whole nation who are his clients. He\nand his noble comrade, Mr. Lorand, are the two men who redeem the record\nof infamy which must long darken the good name of Belgium.\n\nI will now deal swiftly with the records of evil deeds which have occurred\nsince the time which I have already treated. I say \"swiftly\" not because\nthere is not much material from which to choose, but because I feel that\nmy reader must be as sated with horrors as I who have to write them. Here\nare some notes of a journey undertaken by W. Cassie Murdoch, as recently\nas July and September, 1907. This time we are concerned with the Crown\nDomain, King Leopold's private estate, of which we have such accounts\nfrom Mr. Clark and Mr. Scrivener dating as far back as 1894. Thirteen\nyears had elapsed and no change! What do these thirteen represent in\ntorture and murder? Could all these screams be united, what a vast cry\nwould have reached the heavens. In the Congo hell the most lurid glow is\nto be found in the Royal Domain. And the money dragged from these tortured\npeople is used in turn to corrupt newspapers and public men--that it may\nbe possible to continue the system. So the devil's wheel goes round and\nround! Here are some extracts from Mr. Murdoch's report:\n\n    \"I remarked to the old chief of the largest town I came across that\n    his people seemed to be numerous. 'Ah,' said he, 'my people are all\n    dead. These you see are only a very few of what I once had.' And,\n    indeed, it was evident enough that his town had once been a place of\n    great size and importance. There cannot be the least doubt that this\n    depopulation is directly due to the State. Everywhere I went I heard\n    stories of the raids made by the State soldiers. The number of people\n    they shot, or otherwise tortured to death, must have been enormous.\n    Perhaps as many more of those who escaped the rifle died from\n    starvation and exposure. More than one of my carriers could tell of\n    how their villages had been raided, and of their own narrow escapes.\n    They are not a warlike people, and I could hear of no single attempt\n    at resistance. They are the kind of people the State soldiers are most\n    successful with. They would rather any day run away than fight. And in\n    fact, they have nothing to fight with except a few bows and arrows. I\n    have been trying to reckon the probable number of people I met with. I\n    should say that five thousand is, if anything, beyond the mark. A few\n    years ago the population of the district I passed through must have\n    been four times that number. On my return march I was desirous of\n    visiting Mbelo, the place where Lieutenant Massard had been stationed,\n    and in which he committed his unspeakable outrages. On making\n    inquiries, however, I was told that there were no people there now,\n    and that the roads were all 'dead.' On reaching one of the roads that\n    led there, it was evident enough that it had not been used for a long\n    time. Later on, I was able to confirm the statement that what had once\n    been a district with numerous large towns, was now completely\n    empty....\n\n    \"With the exception of a few people living near the one State post now\n    existing on this side of the Lake, who supply the State with _kwanga_\n    and large mats, all the people I saw are taxed with rubber. The rubber\n    tax is an intolerable burden--how intolerable I should have found it\n    almost impossible to believe had I not seen it. It is DIFFICULT TO\n    DESCRIBE IT CALMLY. What I found was simply this: The _'tax' demands\n    from twenty to twenty-five days' labour every month_. There never was\n    a 'forty hours per month labour law' in the Crown Domain, and so long\n    as the tax is demanded in rubber, there never will be--at least in the\n    section of it I visited. If that law were applied, no rubber would, or\n    could possibly, be produced, for the simple reason that _there is no\n    rubber left in this section of the Domain_.\n\n    \"It was some time before I made the discovery that in the Domaine de\n    la Couronne west of Lake Leopold there is no rubber. On my way through\n    I was continually meeting numbers of men going out on the hunt for\n    rubber, and heard with amazement the distance they had to walk. It\n    seemed so impossible that I was somewhat sceptical of the truth of\n    what I was told. But I heard the same story so often, and in so many\n    different places, that I was at last obliged to accept it. On my\n    return I followed up this track, and found that it was all true. And I\n    found also that the rubber is collected from the Domaine Priv\u00c3\u00a9 in\n    forests from ten to forty miles beyond the boundary of the Crown\n    Domain.\n\n    \"Once the vines had been found the working of the rubber is a small\n    part of the labour. I have made a careful calculation of the distance\n    the people I met have to walk, and I find that the average _cannot be\n    less than 300 miles there and back_. But walking to the forest and\n    back does not occupy from twenty to twenty-five days per month. They\n    will cover the 300 miles in ten or twelve days. The rest of the time\n    is used in hunting for the vines, and in tapping them when found. I\n    met a party returning with their rubber who had been six nights in the\n    forest. This was the lowest number. _Most of them have to spend ten,\n    some as many as fifteen, nights in the forest._ Two days after I left\n    the Domain on my way back I saw some men returning empty-handed. They\n    had been hunting for over eight days and had found nothing. What the\n    poor wretches would do I cannot imagine. If they failed to produce the\n    usual amount of rubber on the appointed day they would be put in\n    '_bloc_' (imprisoned).\n\n    \"The workmen of the _chef de poste_ at Mbongo described a concoction\n    which is sometimes administered to capitas when their tale of rubber\n    is short. The white man chops up green tobacco leaves and soaks them\n    in water. Red peppers are added, and a dose of the liquid is\n    administered to defaulting capitas. This wily official manages to get\n    thirteen monthly 'taxes' in the year. At one village I bought a\n    contrivance by which the natives reckon when the tax falls due. Pieces\n    of wood are strung on a piece of cane. One piece is moved up every\n    day. On counting them I found there were only twenty-eight. I asked\n    why, and was told that originally there were thirty pieces, but the\n    white man had so often sent on the twenty-eighth day to say the time\n    was up, that at last they took off two.\n\n    \"Individual acts of atrocity here have for the most part ceased. The\n    State agents seem to have come to the conclusion that it is a waste of\n    cartridges to shoot down these people. BUT THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS A VAST\n    ATROCITY INVOLVING THE PEOPLE IN A STATE OF UNIMAGINABLE MISERY. One\n    man said to me, 'Slaves are happy compared with us. Slaves are\n    protected by their masters, they are fed and clothed. As for us--the\n    capitas do with us what they like. Our wives have to plant the cassava\n    gardens and fish in the stream to feed us while we spend our days\n    working for Bula Matadi. No, we are not even slaves.' And he is right.\n    _It is not slavery as slavery was generally understood: it is not even\n    the uncivilized African's idea of slavery. There never was a slavery\n    more absolute in its despotism or more fiendish in its tyranny._\"\n\nIt will be seen that, so far as the people are concerned, the problem is\nlargely solved, the bitterness of death is past. No European intervention\ncan save them. In many places they have been utterly destroyed. But they\nwere the wards of Europe, and surely Europe, if she is not utterly lost to\nshame, will have something to say to their fate!\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nSOME CATHOLIC TESTIMONY AS TO THE CONGO\n\n\nIt must be admitted that the Roman Catholic Church, as an organized body,\nhas not raised her voice as she should in the matter of the Congo. Never\nwas there such a field for a Las Casas. It was the proudest boast of that\nchurch that in the dark days of man's history she was the one power which\nstood with her spiritual terrors between the oppressor and the oppressed.\nThis noble tradition has been sadly forgotten in the Congo, where the\nmissions have themselves, as I understand, done most excellent work, but\nwhere the power of the Church has never been invoked against the constant\nbarbarities of the State. In extenuation, it may be stated that the chief\nCatholic establishments are down the river and far from the rubber zones.\nIt is important, however, to collect under a separate heading such\ntestimony as exists, for an unworthy attempt has been made to represent\nthe matter as a contest between rival creeds, whereas it is really a\ncontest between humanity and civilization on one side and cruel greed upon\nthe other.\n\nThe organization of the Catholic Church is more disciplined, and admits of\nless individualism than that of those religious bodies which supplied the\nvaliant champions of right in the Congo. The simple priests were doubtless\nas horrified as others, within the limit of their knowledge, but the means\nof expression were denied them. M. Colfs, himself a Catholic, said in the\nBelgian Chamber: \"Our missionaries have less liberty than foreign\nmissionaries. They are expected to keep silence.... There is a gag. This\ngag is placed in the mouth of Belgian missionaries.\"\n\nSignor Santini, the Catholic and Royalist Deputy for Rome, has been one of\nthe leaders in the anti-Congo movement, and has done excellent work in\nItaly. From his own sources of information he confirms and amplifies all\nthat the English and Americans have asserted. Speaking in the Italian\nParliament on February 4th, 1907, Signor Santini said:\n\n    \"I am proud to have been the first to bring the question of the Congo\n    before this House. If at the present day we are spared the shame of\n    seeing again officers of our Army, valorous and perfectly stainless,\n    serving under and at the orders of an association of sweaters,\n    slave-holders and barbarians, it is legitimate for me to declare that\n    I have, if only modestly, at least efficaciously, co-operated in this\n    result.\"\n\nThere is no conflict of creeds in such an utterance as that.\n\nCatholic papers have occasionally spoken out bravely upon the subject.\n\n_Le Patriote_, of Brussels (Royalist and Catholic), in its issue of\nFebruary 28th, 1907, has an indignant editorial:\n\n    \"The rebellion in the A.B.I.R. territory extends. The Government\n    itself forces the rubber, and delivers it on the Antwerp quay to the\n    brokers of the A.B.I.R.... Nothing is altered on the Congo. The same\n    abominable measures are adopted; the same outrages take place.... The\n    Government is adopting the same measures as in the Mongalla, flooding\n    the A.B.I.R. territory with soldiers to utterly smash the people, whom\n    it thinks will then work, and the rubber output be increased.... The\n    memory of these deeds will remain graven in the memory of men, and in\n    the memory of Divine vengeance. Sooner or later the executioners will\n    have to render an account to God and to history.\"\n\nThere is one order of the Catholic Church which has always had a most\nnoble record in its treatment of native races. These are the Jesuits. No\none who has read the \"History of Paraguay,\" or studied the records of the\nMissions to the Red Indians of the eighteenth century, can forget the\npicture of unselfish devotion which they exhibit. Father Vermeersch, a\nworthy successor of such predecessors, has published a book, \"La Question\nCongolaise,\" in which he finds nothing incompatible between his position\nas a Catholic and his exposure of the abuses of the Congo.\n\nIn all points the position of Father Vermeersch and of the English\nReformers appears to be identical.\n\nOn the rightful possession of the land by the natives he writes in terms\nwhich might be a paragraph from Mr. Morel:\n\n    \"On the Congo the land cannot be supposedly vacant. Presumption is in\n    favour of occupation, of a full occupation. By this is meant that it\n    is not sufficient to recognize to the natives rights of tenure over\n    the land they actually cultivate, or certain rights of\n    usage--wood-cutting, hunting, fishing--on the remainder of the\n    territory; but these rights of usage, which are much more important\n    than with us, appear to imply a full _animus domini_, and to signify a\n    complete appropriation, which is carried out amongst us in different\n    fashion. It is not, in effect, indispensable in natural law that I\n    should exhaust the utility of an article or of land in order to be\n    able to claim it as my own; it suffices that I should make use of it\n    in a positive manner, but of my own will, personally, and that I\n    should have the will to forbid any stranger to use it without my\n    consent. Hence effective occupation is joined to intention, and all\n    the constituent elements to a valid title of property exist. Let us\n    suppose, moreover, that some great Belgian landowner wishes to convert\n    portions of his property into sporting land--that land, nevertheless,\n    remains in his entire possession. Amongst the Congo natives, no doubt,\n    occupation is usually collective; but such occupation is as worthy of\n    respect as no matter what individual appropriation.\"\n\nHe continues:\n\n    \"To whom does the rubber belong which grows upon the land occupied by\n    the Congo natives? To the natives, and to no one else, without their\n    consent and just compensation.\"\n\nAgain:\n\n    \"To sum up, we recognize it with much regret, the State's\n    appropriation of so-called vacant land on the Congo confronts us with\n    AN IMMENSE EXPROPRIATION.\"\n\nHe makes a bold attack upon King Leopold's own preserve:\n\n    \"Humanity, whose cause we plead, Christian rights, whose principles we\n    endeavour to inculcate, compel us to touch briefly upon a curious and\n    mysterious creation which is peculiar to the Congo State--the _Domaine\n    de la Couronne_.\"\n\n    \"What are the revenues of this mysterious civil personality?\n    Estimates, more or less conjectural in nature, elaborated by M.\n    Cattier appear to establish the profits from the exploitation of\n    rubber alone, at eight to nine millions of francs per annum. M. le\n    Comte de Smet de Naeyer reduces this figure to four or five millions.\n    Short of positive data one can only deal in conjectures. But we regret\n    still more that an impenetrable veil hides from sight all that takes\n    place in the territory of this _Domaine_. IT IS EIGHT OR TEN TIMES THE\n    SIZE OF BELGIUM, AND THROUGHOUT THIS VAST EXTENT OF TERRITORY THERE IS\n    NEITHER MISSIONARY NOR MAGISTRATE.\"\n\nOnly one missionary at that date had entered this dark land, and his\nexclamation was: \"The Bulgarian atrocities are child's play to what has\ntaken place here.\"\n\nFather Vermeersch then proceeds to deal with the Congo balance-sheets. His\ncriticism is most destructive. He shows at considerable length, and with a\nfine grasp of his subject, that there is really no connection at all\nbetween the so-called estimate and the actual budget. In the course of the\nState's development there is an excess running to millions of pounds which\nhas never been accounted for. In this Father Vermeersch is in agreement\nwith the equally elaborate calculations of Professor Cattier, of Brussels.\n\nHe puts the economical case in a nutshell thus:\n\n    \"X----, District Commissioner, commits every day dozens of offences\n    against individual liberty. What can be done? These violations of the\n    law are necessitated by a great enterprise which must have workmen. In\n    such cases the intervention of the magistrate would be a ruinous\n    imprudence, calculated to bring trouble into the region.\"\n\n    \"But the law?\"\n\n    \"Oh, law in the Congo is not applicable!\"\n\n    \"But if you offered a decent remuneration, would you not get free\n    labour?\"\n\n    \"That is precisely what the State will not listen to. It maintains\n    that the enterprise must be carried out for nothing!\"\n\nAnd disposes once again of the \"forty hours a month\" fiction:\n\n    \"It is IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE STATE TO OBTAIN THE AMOUNT OF RUBBER IT\n    SELLS ANNUALLY, BY LABOUR LIMITED TO FORTY HOURS A MONTH, especially\n    when it is borne in mind that a number of these hours are absorbed in\n    other _corv\u00c3\u00a9es_. Of two things one, therefore. Either the surplus is\n    furnished freely; and if so, how can coercion be logically argued? Or\n    this supplementary labour is forced; and if so, the law of forty hours\n    is shown to be merely a fraud.\"\n\nHe shows the root causes of the evil:\n\n    \"So long as an inflexible will fixes in advance the quantity of rubber\n    to be obtained; so long as instructions are given in this form:\n    'Increase by five tons your rubber output per month' (instance given\n    by Father Cus and van Hencxthoven in their report), we cannot await\n    with confidence a serious improvement, which is the desire of all....\"\n\n    \"The Governor-General dismisses and appoints magistrates at his will,\n    suspends the execution of penalties; even sends back, if need be,\n    gentlemen of the gown to Europe. Who does not realize the grave\n    inconvenience of this dependence? That is not all. No proceedings can\n    be attempted against a European without the authority of the\n    Governor-General.\"\n\nAnd, finally, his reasons for writing his book:\n\n    \"The contemplation of an immeasurable misery has caused us to publish\n    this book. The gravity of the evil, its roots causes, had long escaped\n    us. When we knew them we could not retain within ourselves the\n    compassion with which we were imbued, and we resolved to tell the\n    citizens of a generous country, appealing to their religion, to their\n    patriotism, to their hearts.\"\n\nSurely after such evidence from such a source there must be some\nheart-searchings among those higher members of the Catholic hierarchy,\nincluding both Cardinals and Bishops, who have done what they could to\ncripple the efforts of the reformers. Misinformed through their own want\nof care in searching for the truth, they have stood before the whole world\nas the defenders of that which will be described by the historian as the\ngreatest crime in history.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\nTHE EVIDENCE UP TO DATE\n\n\nI shall now append some extracts from the reports of several British\nVice-Consuls and Consuls sent in during the last few years. These bear\nless upon outrages, which have admittedly greatly decreased, but mainly\nupon the general condition of the people, which is one of deplorable\npoverty and misery--a slavery without that care which the owner was bound\nto exercise over the health and strength of the slave. I shall give\nwithout comment some extracts from the reports of Vice-Consul Mitchell,\nwhich date from July, 1906:\n\n    \"Most of the primitive bridges over the numerous creeks and marshes\n    had rotted away, and we had some difficulty in crossing on fallen\n    trees or a few thin sticks. This was the case all the way to Banalya,\n    and I may here state that this condition of the roads, even of the\n    most frequented, is universal in this province. The reason is that the\n    local authorities have neither men, means, nor time at their disposal\n    for the making of decent roads. _The parsimony of the State in this\n    respect is the more remarkable in the 'Domaine Priv\u00c3\u00a9,' whence large\n    amounts are derived, and where next to nothing is expended._\n\n    \"So long as the policy of the State Government is to extract all it\n    can from the country, while using only local materials, and spending\n    the least possible amount on development and improvements, no increase\n    in the general well-being can be expected....\n\n    \"... At all the posts on the north (right) bank, between Yambuya and\n    Basoko, I found the European agents absent in the interior, and at\n    Basoko itself only the doctor was left in charge, all the rest of the\n    staff _being away_ '_en exp\u00c3\u00a9dition_,' that is, on punitive\n    expeditions.\n\n    \"I stayed at Basoko for five days, partly at Dr. Grossule's request,\n    and partly in the endeavour to learn something of the operations\n    going on in the interior. Three canoe-loads of prisoners arrived, all\n    heavily loaded with chains. But all I could learn was that they were\n    sent in by Lieutenant Baron von Otter, who had been sent to the\n    promontory lying between the mouth of the Aruwimi and the Congo to\n    enforce the Labour Ordinances.\n\n    \"In all the Basenji villages through which I have passed on my two\n    journeys, the natives assert that it _takes them three weeks every\n    month to find and make their tale of rubber, besides taking it once\n    every three months to the State post, from four to six days distant_.\n\n    \"This country is taxed to the utmost, not one penny of the proceeds of\n    which is spent on the roads. This condition of the most important\n    highway in the province is nothing less than disgraceful, and yet this\n    is the road of which the authorities are really proud.\n\n    \"Thus, with the exception of a trivial payment for some things, the\n    Government carries on the work of the country at no expense beyond the\n    wages and the European rations of the white agents, and these are\n    excessively few in number. It is true there are the _Force Publique_\n    and some _travailleurs_. These are recruited by conscription and\n    receive pay and rations, but it is at the lowest possible rate....\n\n    \"Coming to the Basenji, the following particulars of a village in the\n    forest will show their liabilities. This village has fourteen adult\n    males; its neighbour, which works with it, the chiefs being brothers,\n    has nine. Each man has to take to the State post a large basket,\n    holding about twenty-five pounds of rubber, once every month and a\n    half. To get this rubber, though they find it only one day's journey\n    distant, takes them thirty days. It then takes them five days to carry\n    it to the State post, and three days to return. Thus they spend\n    thirty-eight days out of forty-five in the compulsory service of the\n    State. For the basket of rubber they receive 1 kilog. of salt,\n    nominally worth 1 fr. The chief receives 1 kilog. of salt for the\n    whole. If the rubber is deficient in quality or quantity, the man is\n    liable to be whipped and imprisoned without trial. As it is supposed\n    to be the equivalent of the forty hours' monthly labour, I fail to see\n    by what right the man can be held responsible for the quality, even if\n    he wilfully adulterates it with other substances.\n\n    \"The people are all disheartened, and are unanimously of the opinion\n    that they were better off under the Arabs, whose rule was\n    intermittent, and from whom they could run away....\n\n    \"I must say that during more than nineteen years' experience in\n    Northern and Central Africa, _I have never seen such a miserably poor\n    lot as the Basenji in this State_....\n\n    \"It is perfectly clear that the Inspectors, however conscientious,\n    hard-working, and faithful they may be, _cannot remedy the excessive\n    impositions on the natives under the present system_....\n\n    \"The grant of land and seed to the natives is of _absolutely no use_\n    to them _till they are left time to use them_....\n\n    \"To say that the State cannot afford the expense is absurd. The Congo\n    is taxed unmercifully, and I do not suppose any country has less money\n    spent upon it. The taxpayer gets literally nothing in return for the\n    life of practical slavery he has to spend in the support of the\n    Government.\n\n    \"If trade and navigation were really free, and guarded by proper\n    police, German trade through Ujiji, which already exists to some\n    extent, might be greatly developed, as well as that with the British\n    colonies and Zanzibar.\n\n    \"The operations of the Dutch traders, who up to a few months ago had\n    quite a considerable fleet of steamers on the Upper Congo and its\n    affluents, and of the French at Brazzaville, and of the Portuguese,\n    would also benefit greatly.\n\n    \"_All these have practically disappeared from the Upper Congo._\n\n    \"Here, as elsewhere, the natives appeared to me to be so heavily taxed\n    as to be depressed and to regard themselves as practically enslaved by\n    the 'Bula Matadi.' The incessant call for rubber, food and labour,\n    leaves them no respite nor peace of mind.\"\n\nThe following are extracts from Vice-Consul Armstrong's report, dated\nOctober, 1906:\n\n    \"As the result of my journey through this portion of the country, I am\n    forced to the conclusion that the condition of the people in the\n    A.B.I.R. territory _is deplorable_, and although those living in the\n    vicinity of the mission stations are, comparatively speaking, safe\n    from ill-treatment by the rubber agents and their armed sentries,\n    those in other parts are subjected to the gravest abuses.\n\n    \"There is no free labour, the natives being forced to work at a\n    totally inadequate wage. In visiting the various rubber-working towns,\n    one would expect to see some signs of European commodities that had\n    been given in exchange for the millions of pounds' worth of rubber\n    that has been extracted from them, but the native residents possess\n    actually nothing at all.\n\n    \"_Their conditions of living are deplorable_, and the filth and\n    squalor of their villages is only too apparent. _The people live in a\n    state of uncertainty as to the advent of police officers and soldiers,\n    who invariably chase them from their abodes and destroy their huts,\n    and for this reason it is impossible for them to better their\n    condition of living by the construction of suitable dwellings._\n\n        \"_No change of system to be looked for._\n\n    \"No change in the existing system can be looked for until a more\n    reasonable method of taxation is adopted. The present system permits\n    the rubber agents to extract the largest possible quantity of rubber\n    from the native at the lowest possible wage, and allows the employment\n    of armed sentries to enforce this deplorable system.\"\n\nIn these despatches Vice-Consul Armstrong gives evidence of a plot against\nthe sturdy Mr. Stannard upon the part of the infamous A.B.I.R. Company.\nTheir idea, no doubt, was to break down his health and embitter his\nexistence by successive law-suits. In May of 1906, the natives of a\nvillage called Lokongi rose up against his murderous sentries and burned\ntheir houses. A charge was at once made against Mr. Stannard of having\ninstigated them to this very natural and commendable action. Natives had\nbeen suborned or terrified into giving evidence against him, and it might\nhave gone ill with him had it not been for the prompt action of the\nConsul. He set off for the village, accompanied by Mr. Stannard and the\nA.B.I.R. director. The natives were assembled and asked to speak the\ntruth. They said, without hesitation, that Mr. Stannard had had nothing to\ndo with the matter, but that the representatives of the company had\nthreatened to torture them unless they said that he had. The A.B.I.R.\ndirector held his peace before these revelations and had no explanation to\noffer. Consul Armstrong then pointed out to the Public Prosecutor in good,\nstraight terms, which his official superiors might well imitate, that the\nmatter had gone far enough, that English patience was almost exhausted,\nand that Mr. Stannard should be baited no longer. The case was dropped.\n\nI shall pass straight on now to the most recent reports received from the\nCongo, to show that there is no difference at all in the general\ncondition, so far as it is reported by the impartial men at the spot, save\nthat the actual killings and maimings have decreased. The great oppression\nand misery of the people seem to grow rather than abate. The following\nextracts are from Consul Thesiger's report of his experiences in the\nKasai Company's district. This company, it may be worth remarking, has\npaid the enormous dividend of seven hundred per cent. The first paragraph\nmay be commended to the consideration of those British or American\ntravellers who, on the strength of a flying visit, venture to contradict\nthe experience of those white men who spend their lives in the country:\n\n    \"Although from the evidence of State officials it has been proved that\n    individual cases of abuses are not infrequent even at these posts, the\n    chance traveller will certainly see nothing of them, and when he\n    judges of the condition of the country by what he actually sees at\n    these stations, his opinions may be perfectly honest, but they are\n    absolutely worthless. It is as though some well-meaning person, who\n    had heard that a certain fashionable firm was making a fortune by\n    sweated labour, were to venture to deny the facts because a cursory\n    visit to the West End establishment showed that the salesmen behind\n    the counter were well-dressed and well-nourished, ignoring altogether\n    the festering misery of the sweaters' dens in which every article sold\n    over that counter was made up.\"\n\nAfter showing that the Kasai Company, in their haste for wealth (and,\nperhaps, in their foresight, as knowing that their occupancy may be\nbrought to an end), are cutting down the rubber vines instead of tapping\nthem (illegal, of course, but what does that matter where Belgian\nConcessionnaires are in question), goes on to show the pressure on the\npeople:\n\n    \"The work is compulsory; it is also incessant. The vines have to be\n    sought out in the forest, cut down and disentangled from the\n    high-growing branches, divided into lengths, and carried home. This\n    operation has to be continually repeated, as no man can carry a larger\n    quantity of the heavy vine lengths than will keep him occupied for two\n    or three days. Accidents are frequent, especially among the Bakuba,\n    who are large-built men, hunters and agriculturists by nature, and\n    unaccustomed to tree climbing. Large as the Bakuba villages still are,\n    the population is diminishing. Here there is no sleeping sickness to\n    account for the decrease, there have been no epidemics of late years;\n    exposure, overwork, and shortage of proper food alone are responsible\n    for it. The Bakuba district was formerly one of the richest\n    food-producing regions in the country, maize and millet being the\n    staple crops, together with manioc and other plants. So much so was\n    this the case that the mission at Luebo used to send there to buy\n    maize. Under the present _r\u00c3\u00a9gime_ the villagers are not allowed to\n    waste in cultivating, hunting or fishing--time which should be\n    occupied in making rubber.\n\n    \"In a few villages they were cultivating by stealth small patches in\n    the forest, where they were supposed to be out cutting the rubber\n    vines; but everywhere else it was the same story: the capitas would\n    not allow them time to clear new ground for cultivation, or permit\n    them to hunt or fish; if they tried to do so their nets and implements\n    were destroyed. The majority of the capitas, when questioned,\n    acknowledged quite frankly that they had orders to that effect. These\n    villages are living on the produce of the old manioc fields, and are\n    buying food from the Bakette. Under these circumstances it is not\n    surprising that the population is diminishing. As one woman expressed\n    it: 'The men go out hungry into the forest; when they come back they\n    get sick and die.' The village of Ibunge, where formerly the largest\n    market of the district was held weekly, now consists of a collection\n    of hovels, eight of which are habitable, and the market is all but\n    dead.\"\n\nSo the capitas are at their old work the same as ever. The Congo idea of\nreforming them has always been to change their name--so by calling a\nburglar a policeman a great reformation is effected.\n\nRead, however, the following passage, which shows that if the capita is\nthe same, so also is the agent. The white race is certainly superior, for\nwhen the savage sentry's heart relented the white man was able to scourge\nhim back to his inhuman task:\n\n    \"Once I had got outside the zone surrounding Ibanj, where the villages\n    are not taxed in rubber, I found the capitas, with very few\n    exceptions, were all armed with cap-guns. I met them frequently,\n    escorting the rubber caravans to the company post, or going from\n    village to village collecting the rubber from the centres under their\n    charge and distributing the trade goods for the coming month. I\n    noticed that they invariably carried their guns, and, in fact, I have\n    seldom seen a capita stir outside his own home without his gun. These\n    are the men who are appointed by the Kasai Company agents to enforce\n    the rubber tax. Chosen always from a different race, they have no\n    sympathy with the natives placed under them, and having the authority\n    of the agent behind them they can do as they please, so long as they\n    insure the rubber being brought at the proper times and in sufficient\n    quantities. In the villages they are absolute masters, and the\n    villagers have to supply them gratis with a house, food, palm wine,\n    and a woman. They exercise freely the right of beating or imprisoning\n    the villagers for any imaginary offences or for neglecting their work\n    in any way, and even go as far as imposing fines in cowries on their\n    own account, and confiscating for their own use the cowries paid over\n    by the plaintiff or defendant's family in the case of trial by poison,\n    which, in spite of statements to the contrary recently made in the\n    Belgian Chamber, are of frequent occurrence in this country. The\n    native cannot complain or obtain satisfaction in any way, as the\n    capita acts in the name of the company, and the company's agent is\n    always threatening them in the name of 'Bula-Matadi.' If the\n    authorities wish to act in the matter, they might profitably make\n    inquiry into the doings of the capitas at Bungueh, Bolong, and into\n    those of the Zappo Zap capita, who appears to exercise the chief\n    control over the villages near Ibunge, though he does not live in the\n    latter town. These appear to me to be among the worst where most are\n    bad. The capitas, however, are scarcely to be blamed, as, if they do\n    not extort enough rubber, they are liable in their turn to suffer at\n    the hands of the agent. Witness a case at Sangela, when it was\n    reported that the capita had some time back been chicotted in the\n    village itself by the agent for not bringing in rubber sufficient.\n    Endless cases could be quoted, but these will probably be sufficient\n    to show the methods pursued under the auspices of the Kasai Company.\n    Yet in a letter dated the eighth of March, 1908, we find Dr. Dreypondt\n    writing reproachfully:\n\n        \"'You know we have no armed sentries, but only tradesmen going,\n        with goods of every kind, and unarmed, through the villages for\n        the purchasing of rubber. We use only one trading\n        principle--_l'offre et la demande_.'\"\n\nThe laws at all points are completely ignored, \"and many of the agents not\nonly punish the natives in these ways themselves, but allow their capitas\nthe same privileges. It is only by these means that the natives can be\nkept at their incessant work.\"\n\nSuicide is not natural with African, as it is with some Oriental races.\nBut it has come in with the other blessings of King Leopold.\n\n    \"At Ibanj, for instance, only a day's march from a State post, two\n    Bakette from the village of Baka-Tomba were not long ago imprisoned\n    for shortage of rubber, and were daily taken out under the charge of\n    an armed native to work in the fields with ropes round their necks.\n    One of them, tired of captivity, pretended one day that he saw some\n    animal in a tree and obtained leave from the guard to try and get it.\n    He climbed the tree, tied the rope which was round his neck to a\n    branch and hung himself. He was cut down, and, after a considerable\n    time, was resuscitated, thanks to the medical experience of one of the\n    missionaries. I was able to question the man myself at his village,\n    and the story was also confirmed by the Capita.\"\n\nThe American flag presents no refuge for the persecuted.\n\n    \"About the same time this same man had the effrontery to take some\n    seven armed natives on to the station of the American mission, during\n    the absence of the missionaries, and demand from the native who was\n    left in charge that he should hand over to him a native, not in his\n    own employ, who had run away in consequence of some dispute, and who\n    he declared was hiding at the mission. The overseer, a Sierra Leone\n    man, very rightly declared his inability to do so, and said he must\n    await the return of the missionaries. An altercation followed, and the\n    agent struck him twice in the face. The man being a British subject, I\n    told him if he chose to prosecute I would support him, or else I would\n    insist on the agent paying him an indemnity in cloth. As a prosecution\n    would have entailed his going to Lusambo, a fifteen days' journey,\n    with every prospect of being kept there some four to six months with\n    all the witnesses while awaiting the hearing of his case, he chose the\n    latter method. The cloth was paid.\"\n\nHe continues:\n\n    \"These cases can all be substantiated, and are typical of a certain\n    class of agent which is unfortunately, although not general, far too\n    common. Numerous complaints were also made to me in different villages\n    against an agent, not only that he beat and imprisoned the natives for\n    shortage of rubber, but also that he obliged them to supply him with\n    alcohol distilled from palm wine, and was in the habit of taking any\n    of the village women that struck his fancy at the weekly market held\n    on or near his own post. The Company, I believe, promised the American\n    mission last May that this man should be removed, but when I passed\n    through he was still there. Placed in the power of men like these the\n    natives dare not complain to the authorities, and are entirely\n    helpless.\"\n\nNominally the Company makes no punitive expeditions. As a matter of fact\nthey have engaged Lukenga, a warlike chief of the neighbourhood, to do it\nfor them. Nominally the capitas are not supplied with guns. As a matter of\nfact they all carry guns, which are declared to be their personal\nproperty. At every corner one meets hypocrisy and evasion of law.\n\nSpeaking of the Bakuba, the Consul says:\n\n    \"Although not wanting in physical courage or strength, they are rather\n    an agricultural than a warlike race, and their villages were formerly\n    noted for their well-built and artistically decorated houses and their\n    well-cultivated fields.\n\n    \"It is, however, their misfortune to live in a forest country rich in\n    rubber vines, and they have consequently come under the curse of the\n    concessionary Company in the shape of the Kasai Trust. As a result\n    their native industries are dying out, their houses and fields are\n    neglected, and the population is not only decreasing, but also sinking\n    to the dead-level of the less advanced and less capable races.\n\n    \"There is no doubt that the Bakuba are the most oppressed race to-day\n    in the Kasai. Harassed by their own king in the interest of the Rubber\n    Company, driven by the agents and their capitas, disarmed and deprived\n    even of the most ordinary rights, they will, if nothing is done to\n    help them, sink to the level of the vicious and degraded Bakette.\n\n    \"One asks oneself in vain what benefits these people have gained from\n    the boasted civilization of the Free State. One looks in vain for any\n    attempt to benefit them or to recompense them in any way for the\n    enormous wealth which they are helping to pour into the Treasury of\n    the State. Their native industries are being destroyed, their freedom\n    has been taken from them, and their numbers are decreasing.\n\n    \"The only efforts made to civilize them have been made by the\n    missionaries, who are hampered at every turn.\"\n\nConsul Thesiger winds up with the remark that as the Company has behaved\nillegally at every turn it has forfeited all claims to consideration and\nthat there is no hope for the country so long as it exists. Straight\nwords--but how much more forcibly do they apply to that Congo State of\nwhich these particular companies are merely an outcome. Until it is swept\nfrom the map there is no hope for the country. You cannot avoid the rank\nproducts while the putridity remains.\n\nThe next document bearing upon the question is from the Rev. H. M.\nWhiteside, from the notorious A.B.I.R. district. I give it in full, that\nthe reader may judge for himself how far the direct Belgian rule has\naltered the situation.\n\n    \"I should like to bring to your notice a few facts regarding the\n    condition of this (A.B.I.R.) district.\n\n    \"After this extensive journey made through the district recently, and\n    particularly the Bompona neighbourhood, I found the people working\n    rubber in all the towns visited with the exception of those taxed in\n    provisions.\n\n    \"It is difficult to know which 'tax,' rubber or provisions, is\n    hardest. The rubber workers implored us to free them from rubber, and\n    at one village upon our departure they followed us a considerable\n    distance, and it was difficult to get away from them. The amount of\n    rubber collected is small compared with what was formerly demanded,\n    but I have no doubt it requires one-third of the time of the people to\n    collect it. Many of the people of the villages behind Bompona were\n    away collecting rubber. We met many of the Ionji people in the forest,\n    either actually engaged in their work or hunting for a district where\n    the vines might have escaped other collectors. We also met other\n    villagers in the bush in quest of rubber. Almost all the village\n    migrates to the forest--men, many women and children--when rubber is\n    required.\n\n    \"In the light of these facts, how worthless are the assertions that\n    rubber 'tax' has been stopped in the A.B.I.R. territory.\n\n    \"With regard to the provision tax, it was difficult to get any data,\n    but it is easy for one to see the oppressed condition of the people\n    when one comes into contact with them. Between the provision tax,\n    porterage and paddlers, I believe that the people of Bompona have got\n    very little time to themselves. There is one thing that one cannot\n    help seeing, viz., the mean, miserable appearance of the people\n    residing around the State post of Bompona. The houses or huts are in\n    keeping with the owners of them. A very small bale of cloth could take\n    the place of all I saw worn. In all the district I never saw a single\n    brass rod, nor any domestic animals except a few miserable chickens.\n    The extreme poverty of the people is most remarkable. There is no\n    doubt as to their desire to possess European goods, but they have\n    nothing with which to buy except rubber and ivory, which is claimed by\n    the State.\n\n    \"It may be thought that I am painting their condition in too dark\n    colours, but I feel it requires strong words to give a fair idea of\n    the utter hopelessness and abject appearance of the people of Bompona,\n    of the people of the villages behind the State post some twenty-five\n    miles away, and in a lesser degree of the rubber workers opposite\n    Bompona.\n\n        \"H. M. WHITESIDE.\n\n    \"Ikau,\n        \"June 15th, 1909.\"\n\nFinally, there is the following report from the extreme other end of the\ncountry. It is dated June 1st, 1909. The name of the sender, though not\npublished, was sent to the Foreign Office. He is an American citizen:\n\n    \"I am sorry to say there is need for agitation for the reform of the\n    Belgian Kwango territory along this frontier. Robbing and murder are\n    still being carried on under the rule of the Belgian official from\n    Popocabacca. Last month he came with an armed force to the district of\n    Mpangala Nlele, two days west of here, to decorate with the Congo\n    medal a new chief in the stead of our old friend Nlekani. Nlekani left\n    a number of sons, but none of them were willing to take the\n    responsibility of the Medal Chieftainship. They, therefore, placed\n    their villages under the authority of a powerful chief living to the\n    north of them.\n\n    \"The official of the Congo Government had been insisting for a year\n    that a younger son of the old chief should consent to be the Medal\n    Chief. This young man, named Kingeleza, was a fine, bright fellow, but\n    thinking that, as a younger son, he would lack the necessary authority\n    over the people and would get into trouble with the Government if he\n    could not satisfy its requirements, he declined. The Belgian official\n    was, however, so insistent that Kingeleza had finally agreed in order\n    to avoid a clash with the Government.\n\n    \"On his way to make the 'investiture,' the Belgian official robbed\n    some villages and killed two men. Kingeleza's people, who had gathered\n    together to witness the investiture, hearing of the treatment meted\n    out to the other villages, took fright and fled from their own\n    villages, which the Belgians, upon arriving, found deserted. Whereupon\n    the soldiers proceeded to ferret the fugitives out of the woods, where\n    they were hiding. Twenty were seized, among whom was one of\n    Kingeleza's sisters, a young and attractive looking girl. Four of the\n    villagers were subsequently released, and the balance marched off with\n    other spoils to Popocabacca. The evangelist attached to the American\n    mission, who was absent in the Lower Congo, had his house broken open\n    and a tent and school materials carried off.\n\n    \"As for Kingeleza, some of the Belgian soldiers met him in the path\n    and shot him. They did not know that he was Kingeleza, and Kingeleza\n    is still being sought for by the Belgian official.\n\n    \"This same 'Chief of Brigands,' as I prefer to call him, has just been\n    on another raid for which he even entered Portuguese territory within\n    a few hours of where I am writing, wantonly destroying all that he\n    could not carry off. The people had, happily, all escaped before he\n    arrived. The Portuguese are reporting this outrage to the\n    Governor-General at Loanda.\"\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\nTHE POLITICAL SITUATION\n\n\nI have not in this statement touched upon the financial side of the Congo\nState. A huge scandal lies there--so huge that the limits of it have not\nyet been defined. I will not go into that morass. If Belgians wish to be\nhoodwinked in the matter, and to have their good name compromised in\nfinance as well as in morality, it is they who in the end will suffer. One\nmay merely indicate the main points, that during the independent life of\nthe Congo State all accounts have been kept secret, that no budgets of the\nlast year but only estimates of the coming one have ever been published,\nthat the State has made huge gains, in spite of which it has borrowed\nmoney, and that the great sums resulting have been laid out in\nspeculations in China and elsewhere, that sums amounting in the aggregate\nto at least \u00c2\u00a37,000,000 of money have been traced to the King, and that\nthis money has been spent partly in buildings in Belgium, partly in land\nin the same country, partly in building on the Riviera, partly in the\ncorruption of public men, and of the European and American Press (our own\nbeing not entirely untarnished, I fear), and, finally, in the expenses of\nsuch a private life as has made King Leopold's name notorious throughout\nEurope. Of the guilty companies the poorest seem to pay fifty and the\nrichest seven hundred per cent. per annum. There I will leave this\nunsavoury side of the matter. It is to humanity that I appeal, and that is\nconcerned with higher things.\n\nBefore ending my task, however, I would give a short account of the\nevolution of the political situation as it affected, first, Great Britain\nand the Congo State; secondly, Great Britain and Belgium. In each case\nGreat Britain was, indeed, the spokesman of the civilized world.\n\nSo far as one can trace, no strong protest was raised by the British\nGovernment at the time when the Congo State took the fatal step, the\ndirect cause of everything which has followed, of leaving the honest\npath, trodden up to that time by all European Colonies, and seizing the\nland of the country as their own. Only in 1896 do we find protests against\nthe ill-usage of British coloured subjects, ending in a statement in\nParliament from Mr. Chamberlain that no further recruiting would be\nallowed. For the first time we had shown ourselves in sharp disagreement\nwith the policy of the Congo State. In April, 1897, a debate was raised on\nCongo affairs by Sir Charles Dilke without any definite result.\n\nOur own troubles in South Africa (troubles which called forth in Belgium a\nburst of indignation against wholly imaginary British outrages during the\nwar) left us little time to fulfil our Treaty obligations toward the\nnatives on the Congo. In 1903 the matter forced itself to the front again,\nand a considerable debate took place in the House of Commons, which ended\nby passing a resolution with almost complete unanimity to the following\neffect:\n\n    \"That the Government of the Congo Free State, having, at its\n    inception, guaranteed to the Powers that its native subjects should be\n    governed with humanity, and that no trading monopoly or privilege\n    should be permitted within its dominions; this House requests His\n    Majesty's Government to confer with the other Powers, signatories of\n    the Berlin General Act, by virtue of which the Congo Free State\n    exists, in order that measures may be adopted to abate the evils\n    prevalent in that State.\"\n\nIn July of the same year there occurred the famous three days' debate in\nthe Belgian House, which was really inaugurated by the British resolution.\nIn this debate the two brave Reformers, Vandervelde and Lorand, though\ncrushed by the voting power of their opponents, bore off all the honours\nof war. M. de Favereau, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, alternately\nexplained that there was no connection at all between Belgium and the\nCongo State, and that it was a breach of Belgian patriotism to attack the\nlatter. The policy of the Congo State was upheld and defended by the\nBelgian Government in a way which must forever identify them with all the\ncrimes which I have recounted. No member of the Congo administration could\never have expressed the intimate spirit of Congo administration so\nconcisely as M. de Smet de Naeyer, when he said, speaking of the natives:\n\"They are not entitled to anything. What is given them is a pure\ngratuity.\" Was there ever in the world such an utterance as that from a\nresponsible statesman! In 1885 a State is formed for the \"moral and\nmaterial improvement of the native races.\" In 1903 the native \"is not\nentitled to anything.\" The two phrases mark the beginning and the end of\nKing Leopold's journey.\n\nIn 1904 the British Government showed its continued uneasiness and disgust\nat the state of affairs on the Congo by publishing the truly awful report\nof Consul Casement. This document, circulated officially all over the\nglobe, must have opened the eyes of the nations, if any were still shut,\nto the true object and development of King Leopold's enterprise. It was\nhoped that this action upon the part of Great Britain would be the first\nstep toward intervention, and, indeed, Lord Lansdowne made it clear in so\nmany words that our hand was outstretched, and that if any other nation\nchose to grasp it, we would proceed together to the task of compulsory\nreform. It is not to the credit of the civilized nations that not one was\nready to answer the appeal. If, finally, we are forced to move alone, they\ncannot say that we did not ask and desire their co-operation.\n\nFrom this date remonstrances were frequent from the British Government,\nthough they inadequately represented the anger and impatience of those\nBritish subjects who were aware of the true state of affairs. The British\nGovernment refrained from going to extremes because it was understood that\nthere would shortly be a Belgian annexation, and it was hoped that this\nwould mark the beginning of better things without the necessity for our\nintervention. Delay followed delay, and nothing was done. A Liberal\nGovernment was as earnest upon the matter as its Unionist predecessor, but\nstill the diplomatic etiquette delayed them from coming to a definite\nconclusion. Note followed note, while a great population was sinking into\nslavery and despair. In August, 1906, Sir Edward Grey declared that we\n\"could not wait forever,\" and yet we see that he is waiting still. In 1908\nthe long looked-for annexation came at last, and the Congo State exchanged\nthe blue flag with the golden star for the tricolour of Belgium. Immediate\nand radical reforms were promised, but the matter ended as all previous\npromises have done. In 1909 M. Renkin, the Belgian Colonial Minister, went\nout to inspect the Congo State, and had the frankness before going to say\nthat nothing would be changed there. This assurance he repeated at Boma,\nwith a flourish about the \"genial monarch\" who presided over their\ndestinies. By the time this pamphlet is printed M. Renkin will be back, no\ndoubt with the usual talk of minor reforms, which will take another year\nto produce, and will be utterly futile when reduced to practice. But the\nworld has seen this game too often. Surely it will not be made a fool of\nagain. There is some limit to European patience.\n\nMeanwhile, in this very month of August, 1909, a full year after the\nannexation by Belgium (an annexation, be it mentioned, which will not be\nofficially recognized by Great Britain until she is satisfied in the\nmatter of reforms), Prince Albert, the heir to the throne, has returned\nfrom the Congo. He says:\n\n    \"The Congo is a marvellous country, which offers unlimited resources\n    to men of enterprise. In my opinion our colony will be an important\n    factor in the welfare of our country, whatever sacrifices we will have\n    to make for its development. What we must do is to work for the moral\n    regeneration of the natives, ameliorate their material situation,\n    suppress the scourge of sleeping sickness, and build new railways.\"\n\n\"Moral regeneration of the natives!\" Moral regeneration of his own family\nand of his own country--that is what the situation demands.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nSOME CONGOLESE APOLOGIES\n\n\nIt only remains to examine some of the Congolese attempts to answer the\nunanswerable. It is but fair to hear the other side, and I will set down\nsuch points as they advance as clearly as I can:\n\n1.--_That the Congo State is independent and that it is no one else's\nbusiness what occurs within its borders._\n\nI have, I trust, clearly shown that by the Berlin Treaty of 1885 the State\nwas formed on certain conditions, and that these conditions as affecting\nboth trade and the natives have not been fulfilled. Therefore we have the\nright to interfere. Apart from the Treaty this right might be claimed on\nthe general grounds of humanity, as has been done more than once with\nTurkey.\n\n2.--_That the French Congo is as bad, and that we do not interfere._\n\nThe French Colonial system has usually been excellent, and there is,\ntherefore, every reason to believe that this one result of evil example\nwill soon be amended. There, at least, we have no Treaty obligation to\ninterfere.\n\n3.--_That the English agitation is due to jealousy of Belgian success._\n\nWe do not look upon it as success, but the most stupendous failure in\nhistory. What is there to be jealous of? Is it the making of money? But we\ncould do the same at once in any tropical Colony if we stooped to the same\nmethods.\n\n4.--_That it is a plot of the Liverpool merchants._\n\nThis legend had its origin in the fact that Mr. Morel, the leader and hero\nof the cause, was in business in Liverpool, and was afterward elected to\nbe a member of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce. There is, indeed, a\nconnection between Liverpool and the movement, because it was while\nengaged in the shipping trade there that Mr. Morel was brought into\nconnection with the persons and the facts which moved him to generous\nindignation, and started him upon the long struggle which he has so\nsplendidly and unselfishly maintained. As a matter of fact, all business\nmen in England have very good reason to take action against a system which\nhas kept their commerce out of a country which was declared to be open to\ninternational trade. But of all towns Liverpool has the least reason to\ncomplain, as it is the centre of that shipping line which (alas! that any\nEnglish line should do so) conveys the Congo rubber from Boma to Antwerp.\n\n5.--_That it is a Protestant scheme in order to gain an advantage over the\nCatholic missions._\n\nIn all British Colonies Catholic missions may be founded and developed\nwithout any hindrance. If the Congo were British to-morrow, no Catholic\nchurch, or school would be disturbed. What advantage, then, would the\nProtestants gain by any change? These charges are, as a matter of fact,\nborne out by Catholics as well as by Protestants. Father Vermeersch is as\nfervid as any English or American pastor.\n\n6.--_That travellers who have passed through the country, and others who\nreside in the country, have seen no trace of outrages._\n\nSuch a defence reminds one of the ancient pleasantry of the man who, being\naccused on the word of three men who were present and saw him do the\ncrime, declared that the balance of evidence was in his favour, since he\nwas prepared to produce ten men who were not present and did not see it.\nOf the white people who live in the country the great majority are in the\nLower Congo, which is not affected by the murderous rubber traffic. Their\nevidence is beside the question. When a traveller passes up the main river\nhis advent is known and all is ready for him. Captain Boyd Alexander\npassed, as I understand, along the frontier, where naturally one would\nexpect the best conditions, since a discontented tribe has only to cross\nthe line. To show the fallacy of such reasoning I would instance the case\nof the Reverend John Howell, who for many years travelled on one of the\nmission boats upon the main river and during that time never saw an\noutrage. No doubt he had formed the opinion that his brethren had been\nexaggerating. Then one day he heard an outburst of firing, and turned his\nlittle steamer to the spot. This is what he saw: \"They were horrified to\nfind the native soldiers of the Government under the eyes of their white\nofficers engaged in mutilating the dead bodies of the natives who had just\nbeen killed. Three native bodies were lying near the river's edge and\nhuman limbs were lying within a few yards from the steamer. A State\nsoldier was seen drawing away the legs and other portions of a human body.\nAnother soldier was seen standing by a large basket in which were the\nviscera of a human body. The missionaries were promptly ordered off the\nbeach by the two officers presiding over this human shambles.\" And this\nwas on the main river, twenty years after the European occupation.\n\n7.--_That land has been claimed by Government in Uganda and other British\nColonies._\n\nWhere land has been so claimed, it has been worked by free labour for the\nbenefit of the African community itself, and not for the purpose of\nsending the proceeds to Europe. This is a vital distinction.\n\n8.--_That odious incidents occur in all Colonies._\n\nIt is true that no Colonial system is always free from such reproach.\n\nBut the object of the normal European system is to discourage and to\npunish such abuses, especially if they occur in high places. I have\nalready given the instance of Eyre, Governor of Jamaica, who was tried for\nhis life in England because he had executed a half-caste at a time when\nthere was actual revolt among the black population, of which he was the\nleader. Germany also has not hesitated to bring to the bar of Justice any\nof her officers who have lowered her prestige by their conduct in the\ntropics. But in the Congo, after twenty years of unexampled horror and\nbrutality, not one single officer above the rank of a simple clerk has\never been condemned, or even, so far as I can learn, tried for conduct\nwhich, had they been British, would assuredly have earned them the\ngallows. What chance would Lothaire or Le Jeune have before a Middlesex\njury? There lies the difference between the systems.\n\n9.--_That the British charges did not begin until the Congo became a\nflourishing State._\n\nSince the Congo's wealth sprang from this barbarous system, it is natural\nthat they both attracted attention at the same time. Rising wealth meant a\nmore rigidly enforced system.\n\n10.--_That the Congo State deserves great credit for having prohibited the\nsale of alcohol to the natives._\n\nIt is true that the sale of alcohol to natives should be forbidden in all\nparts of Africa. It is caused by the competition of trade. If a chief\ndesires gin for his ivory, it is clear that the nation which supplies that\ngin will get the trade, and that which refuses will lose it. This by way\nof explanation, not of apology. But as there is no trade competition in\nthe Congo, they have no reason to introduce alcohol, which would simply\ndetract front the quality and value of their slave population. When\ncompared with the absolute immorality of other Congo proceedings, it is\nclear that the prohibition of alcohol springs from no high motive, but is\npurely dictated by self-interest.\n\n11.--_That the depopulation is due to sleeping sickness._\n\nSleeping sickness is one of the contributory causes, but all the evidence\nin this book will tend to show that the great wastage of the people has\noccurred where the Congo rule has pressed heavily upon them.\n\nSo I bring my task to an end.\n\nI look at my statement of the facts and I wince at its many faults of\nomission. How many specific examples have I left out, how many deductions\nhave I missed, how many fresh sides to the matter have I neglected. It is\nhurried and broken, as a man's speech may be hurried and broken when he is\ndriven to it by a sense of burning injustice and intolerable wrong. But it\nis true--and I defy any man to read it without rising with the conviction\nof its truth. Consider the cloud of witnesses. Consider the minute and\nspecific detail in the evidence. Consider the undenied system which must\n_prima facie_ produce such results. Consider the admissions of the Belgian\nCommission. Not one shadow of doubt can remain in the most sceptical mind\nthat the accusations of the Reformers have been absolutely proved. It is\nnot a thing of the past. It is going on at this hour. The Belgian\nannexation has made no difference. The machinery and the men who work it\nare the same. There are fewer outrages it is true. The spirit of the\nunhappy people is so broken that it is a waste of labour to destroy them\nfurther. That their conditions have not improved is shown by the\nunanswerable fact that the export of rubber has not decreased. That export\nis the exact measure of the terrorism employed. Many of the old districts\nare worked out, but the new ones must be exploited with greater energy to\natone. The problem, I say, remains as ever. But surely the answer is at\nhand. Surely there is some limit to the silent complicity of the civilized\nworld?\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nSOLUTIONS\n\n\nBut what can be done? What course should we pursue? Let us consider a few\npossible solutions and the reasons which bear upon them.\n\nThere is one cardinal fact which dominates everything. It is that _any_\nchange must be for the better. Under their old savage _r\u00c3\u00a9gime_ as Stanley\nfound them the tribes were infinitely happier, richer and more advanced\nthan they are to-day. If they should return undisturbed to such an\nexistence, the situation would, at least, be free from all that lowering\nof the ideals of the white race which is implied by a Belgian occupation.\nWe may start with a good heart, therefore, since whatever happens must be\nfor the better.\n\nCan a solution be found through Belgium?\n\nNo, it is impossible, and that should be recognized from the outset. The\nBelgians have been given their chance. They have had nearly twenty-five\nyears of undisturbed possession, and they have made it a hell upon earth.\nThey cannot disassociate themselves from this work or pretend that it was\ndone by a separate State. It was done by a Belgian King, Belgian soldiers,\nBelgian financiers, Belgian lawyers, Belgian capital, and was endorsed and\ndefended by Belgian governments. It is out of the question that Belgium\nshould remain on the Congo.\n\nNor, in face of reform, would Belgium wish to be there. She could not\ncarry the burden. When the country is restored to its inhabitants together\nwith their freedom, it will be in the same position as those German and\nEnglish colonies which entail heavy annual expenditure from the mother\ncountry. It is a proof of the honesty of German colonial policy, and the\nfitness of Germany to be a great land-owning Power, that nearly all her\ntropical colonies, like our own, show, or have shown, a deficit. It is\neasy to show a profit if a land be exploited as Spain exploited Central\nAmerica, or Belgium the Congo. It would always be more profitable to sack\na business than to run it. Now, if the forced revenue of the Congo State\ndisappeared, it would, at a moderate estimate, take a minimum of a million\na year for twenty years to bring the demoralized State back to the normal\ncondition of a tropical colony. Would Belgium pay this \u00c2\u00a320,000,000? It is\ncertain that she would not. Reform, then, is an absolute impossibility so\nlong as Belgium holds the Congo.\n\nWhat, then, should be done?\n\nThat is for the statesmen of Europe and America to determine. America\nhastened before all the rest of the world in 1884 to recognize this new\nState, and her recognition caused the rest of the world to follow suit.\nBut since then she has done nothing to control what she created. American\ncitizens have suffered as much as British, and American commerce has met\nwith the same impediments, in spite of the shrewd attempt of King Leopold\nto bribe American complicity by allowing some of her citizens to form a\nConcessionnaire Company and so to share in the unholy spoils. But America\nhas a high moral sense, and when the true facts are known to her, and when\nshe learns to distinguish the outcome of King Leopold's dollars from the\nwork of honest publicists, she will surely be ready to move in the matter.\nIt was in crushing pirates that America made her first international\nappearance upon the world's stage. May it be a precedent.\n\nBut to bring the matter to a head the British Government should surely act\nwith no further delay. The obvious course would appear to be that having\nprepared the ground by sounding each of the Great Powers, they should then\nlay before each of them the whole evidence, and ask that a European\nCongress should meet to discuss the situation. Such a Congress would\nsurely result in the partition of the Congo lands--a partition in which\nGreat Britain, whose responsibilities of empire are already too vast,\nmight well play the most self-denying part. If France, having given a\npledge to rule her Congo lands in the same excellent fashion as she does\nthe rest of her African Empire, were to extend her borders to the northern\nbank of the river along its whole course until it turns to the south, then\nan orderly government might be hoped for in those regions. Germany, too,\nmight well extend her East African Protectorate, so as to bring it up to\nthe eastern bank of the Congo, where it runs to the south. With these\nlarge sections removed it would not be difficult to arrange some great\nnative reservation in the centre, which should be under some international\nguarantee which would be less of a fiasco than the last one. The Lower\nCongo and the Boma railway would, no doubt, present difficulties, but\nsurely they are not above solution. And always one may repeat that any\nchange is a change for good.\n\nSuch a partition would form one solution. Another, less permanent and\nstable--and to that extent, as it seems to me, less good--is that which is\nadvanced by Mr. Morel and others. It is an international control of the\nriver, some provision for which is, as I understand, already in existence.\nThe trouble is that what belongs to all nations belongs to no nation, and\nthat when the native risings and general turmoil come, which will surely\nsucceed the withdrawal of Belgian pressure, something stronger and richer\nthan an International Riverine Board will be needed to meet them. I am\nconvinced that partition affords the only chance of solid, lasting\namendment.\n\nLet us suppose, however, that the Powers refuse to convene a meeting, and\nthat we are deserted even by America. Then it is our duty, as it has often\nbeen in the world's history, to grapple single-handed with that which\nshould be a common task. We have often done so before, and if we are\nworthy of our fathers, we will do it again. A warning and a date must be\nfixed, and then we must decide our course of action.\n\nAnd what shall that action be? War with Belgium? On them must rest the\nresponsibility for that. Our measures must be directed against the Congo\nState, which has not yet been recognized by us as being a possession of\nBelgium. If Belgium take up the quarrel then so be it. There are many ways\nin which we can bring the Congo State to her knees. A blockade of the\nCongo is one, but it has the objection of the international complications\nwhich might ensue. An easier way would be to proclaim this guilty land as\nan outlaw State. Such a proclamation means that to no British subject does\nthe law of that land apply. If British traders enter it, they shall be\nstopped at the peril of those who stop them. If British subjects are\nindicted, they shall be tried in our own Consular Courts. If complications\nensue, as is likely, then Boma shall be occupied. This would surely lead\nto that European Conference which we are supposing to have been denied us.\n\nYet another solution. Let a large trading caravan start into the Congoland\nfrom Northern Rhodesia. We claim that we have a right to free trade by the\nBerlin Treaty. We will enforce our claim. To do so would cut at the very\nroots of the Congo system. If the caravan be opposed, then again Boma and\na conference.\n\nMany solutions could be devised, but there is one which will come of\nitself, and may bring about a very sudden end of the Congo Power. Northern\nRhodesia is slowly filling up. The railhead is advancing. The nomad South\nAfrican population, half Boers, half English, adventurers and lion\nhunters, are trekking toward the Katanga border. They are not men who will\ntake less than those rights of free entry and free commerce which are, in\nfact, guaranteed them. Only last year twelve Boer wagons appeared upon the\nKatanga border and were, contrary to all international law, warned off.\nThey are the pioneers of many more. No one has the right, and no one, save\ntheir own Government, has the force to keep them out. Let the Powers of\nEurope hasten to regulate the situation, or some day they may find\nthemselves in the presence of a _fait accompli_. Better an orderly\npartition conducted from Paris or Berlin, than the intrusion of some Piet\nJoubert, with his swarthy followers, who will see no favour in taking that\nwhich they believe to be their right.\n\nBut whichever solution is adopted, the conscience of Europe should not be\ncontent merely with the safeguarding of the future. Surely there should be\nsome punishment for those who by their injustice and violence have dragged\nChristianity and civilization in the dirt. Surely, also, there should be\ncompulsory compensation out of the swollen moneybags of the three hundred\nper cent. concessionnaires for the widows and the orphans, the maimed and\nthe incapacitated. Justice cannot be satisfied with less. An International\nCommission, with punitive powers, may be exceptional, but the whole\ncircumstances are exceptional, and Europe must rise to them. The fear is,\nhowever, that it is the wretched agents on the spot, the poor driven\nbonus-hunters who will be offered up as victims, whereas the real\ncriminals will escape. The curse of blood and the scorn of every honest\nman rest upon them already. Would that they were within the reach of human\njustice also! They have been guilty of the sack of a country, the\nspoliation of a nation, the greatest crime in all history, the greater for\nhaving been carried out under an odious pretence of philanthropy. Surely\nsomehow, somewhere, they will have their reward!\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX\n\n\nNOTE I--THE CHICOTTE\n\nChicotting is alluded to in Congo annals as a minor punishment, freely\ninflicted upon women and children. It is really a terrible torture, which\nleaves the victim flayed and fainting. There is a science in the\nadministration of it. F\u00c3\u00a9licien Challaye tells of a Belgian officer who\nbecame communicative upon the subject. \"One can hardly believe,\" said the\nbrute, \"how difficult it is to administer the chicotte properly. One\nshould spread out the blows so that each shall give a fresh pang. Then we\nhave a law which forbids us to give more than twenty-five blows in one\nday, and to stop when the blood flows. One should, therefore, give\ntwenty-four of the blows vigorously, but without risking to stop; then at\nthe twenty-fifth, with a dexterous twist, one should make the blood\nspurt.\" (\"Le Congo Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais,\" Challaye.) The twenty-five lash law, like\nall other laws, has no relation at all to the proceedings in the Upper\nCongo.\n\nMonsieur Stanislas Lefranc, Judge on the Congo, and one of the few men\nwhose humanity seems to have survived such an experience, says:\n\n\"Every day, at six in the morning and two in the afternoon, at each State\npost can be seen, to-day, as five or even ten years ago, the savoury sight\nwhich I am going to try to depict, and to which new recruits are specially\ninvited.\n\n\"The chief of the post points out the victims; they leave the ranks and\ncome forward, for at the least attempt at flight they would be brutally\nseized by the soldiers, struck in the face by the representative of the\nFree State and the punishment would be doubled. Trembling and terrified,\nthey stretch themselves face down before the captain and his colleagues;\ntwo of their companions, sometimes four, seize them by their hands and\nfeet and take off their waistcloth. Then, armed with a lash of\nhippopotamus hide, similar to what we call a cow-hide, but more flexible,\na black soldier, who is only required to be energetic and pitiless, flogs\nthe victims.\n\n\"Every time the executioner draws away the chicotte a reddish streak\nappears upon the skin of the wretched victims who, although strongly\nbuilt, gasp in terrible contortions.\n\n\"Often the blood trickles, more rarely fainting ensues. Regularly and\nwithout cessation the chicotte winds round the flesh of these martyrs of\nthe most relentless and loathsome tyrants who have ever disgraced\nhumanity. At the first blows the unhappy victims utter terrible shrieks\nwhich soon die down to low groans. In addition, when the officer who\norders the punishment is in a bad humour, he kicks those who cry or\nstruggle. Some (I have witnessed the thing), by a refinement of brutality,\nrequire that, at the moment when they get up gasping, the slaves should\ngraciously give the military salute. This formality, not required by the\nregulations, is really a part of the design of the vile institution which\naims at debasing the black in order to be able to use him and abuse him\nwithout fear.\"--\"Le R\u00c3\u00a9gime Congolais,\" Li\u00c3\u00a9ge, Lefranc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Crime of the Congo, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CRIME OF THE CONGO ***\n\n***** This file should be named 37712-8.txt or 37712-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/7\/7\/1\/37712\/\n\nProduced by Bryan Ness and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team at http:\/\/www.pgdp.net (This file was\nproduced from images generously made available by The\nInternet Archive\/American Libraries.)\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":790,"split":"train"}
