The main character, Miles Coverdale, embarks on a quest for the betterment of the world through the agrarian lifestyle and community of the Blithedale Farm. The story begins with a conversation between Coverdale and Old Moodie, a character who reappears throughout the story. The legend of the mysterious Veiled Lady is introduced; she is a popular clairvoyant who disappears unannounced from the social scene. Coverdale then makes the voyage to Blithedale, where he is introduced to such characters as Zenobia and Mr. and Mrs. Silas Foster. At their first community dinner they are interrupted by the arrival of Hollingsworth, a previous acquaintance of Coverdale's, who is carrying a frail, pale girl. Though Hollingsworth believes the girl (whose age is never clarified) is an expected guest, none of the Blithedale citizens recognize her. She immediately develops a strong attachment to Zenobia, and reveals her name to be Priscilla.\nSoon after, Coverdale becomes severely ill and is bedridden. During his sickness, he believes he is on the brink of death and develops a closeness with Hollingsworth due to their anxiety-ridden situation and discussion of worldly ideals. Hollingsworth and Zenobia take care of him, and he returns to health shortly. As he recovers and spring comes, the residents of the community begin to work the land successfully and prove to their neighbors the plausibility of their cause. Priscilla starts to open up, and relationships between the other characters develop as well. Tension in the friendship between Coverdale and Hollingsworth intensifies as their philosophical disagreements continue. Meanwhile, Zenobia and Hollingsworth become close and rumor flies they might build a house together. Mr. Moodie makes a reappearance and asks about Priscilla and Zenobia for reasons to be revealed later. Coverdale then meets a stranger who turns out to be a Professor Westervelt. Westervelt also asks about Zenobia and Hollingsworth. Coverdale does not like the Professor, and when he is retreating in a tree he overhears the Professor talking to Zenobia and implying that they have a prior relationship.\nAt this point, the narrator of the story briefly switches to Zenobia as she tells a tale entitled \u201cThe Silvery Veil.\u201d She describes the Veiled Lady and her background, though it is never revealed whether her version of the story is true or not. After switching narration back to Coverdale, the story proceeds to Eliot's Pulpit, a place of rest and discourse for the four main characters (Coverdale, Hollingsworth, Priscilla, and Zenobia). There they discuss women's rights, and Zenobia and Hollingsworth agree, against Coverdale, on a more misogynistic point of view. Their disagreements intensify the next day when Hollingsworth and Coverdale discuss their hopes for the future of Blithedale. They disagree so thoroughly that Coverdale renounces Hollingsworth and effectively ends their friendship. A turning point in the novel, the drama culminates with Coverdale's leaving the farm and returning to the city. He there shows a sort of voyeurism, peeping through hotel windows at a young man and another family. Whilst peeping, he spies Zenobia and Westervelt in another window. They notice, and, embarrassed and curious, Coverdale visits them and gets chastised by Zenobia. She also reveals that Priscilla is staying with them, and then all three leave Coverdale for an unnamed appointment. Motivated once more by curiosity, he seeks out Old Moodie, who when drunk tells him the story of Fauntleroy, Zenobia, and Priscilla. It turns out that Old Moodie is Fauntleroy and the father of Zenobia, and was once a wealthy man. He fell from grace, but remarried later and had another child, Priscilla, making the two women half sisters.\nCoverdale is extremely shocked and proceeds to a show of the Veiled Lady, where he recognizes Westervelt as the magician controlling the clairvoyant and Hollingsworth in the audience. He asks the whereabouts of Priscilla, and it is shortly revealed, when Hollingsworth removes the veil, that Priscilla is the Veiled Lady. All of the main characters then return and meet up at Eliot's Pulpit. Zenobia accosts Hollingsworth for his love for Priscilla, expresses her depression, and acknowledges her sisterhood with Priscilla. However, Priscilla chooses Hollingsworth over her and the three go their separate ways. When Zenobia realizes that Coverdale witnessed this scene, she asks him to tell Hollingsworth that he has \u201cmurdered\u201d her and tells him that when they next meet it will be behind the \u201cblack veil,\u201d representing death. She leaves and does not return. Hollingsworth, Coverdale, and Silas Foster form a search party and find Zenobia's body in the river. She is buried at Blithedale and given a simple funeral, at which Westervelt makes a last cryptic appearance and declares her suicide foolish. Hollingsworth is severely affected by the death, and it seems as she promised that Zenobia is haunting him. Priscilla is less affected due to her attachment solely to Hollingsworth, and the rest of the characters part and move on with their lives. The last chapter reflects on the wisdom and ideals of Coverdale, now cynical about his purpose in life. The last sentence reveals cause for his bleak, apathetic outlook\u2014he was in love with Priscilla.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Blithedale Romance, by Nathaniel Hawthorne\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

MILES COVERDALE'S CONFESSION\n\n\n\nI. OLD MOODIE\n\nThe evening before my departure for Blithedale, I was returning to my\nbachelor apartments, after attending the wonderful exhibition of the\nVeiled Lady, when an elderly man of rather shabby appearance met me in\nan obscure part of the street.\n\n\"Mr. Coverdale,\" said he softly, \"can I speak with you a moment?\"\n\nAs I have casually alluded to the Veiled Lady, it may not be amiss to\nmention, for the benefit of such of my readers as are unacquainted with\nher now forgotten celebrity, that she was a phenomenon in the mesmeric\nline; one of the earliest that had indicated the birth of a new\nscience, or the revival of an old humbug.  Since those times her\nsisterhood have grown too numerous to attract much individual notice;\nnor, in fact, has any one of them come before the public under such\nskilfully contrived circumstances of stage effect as those which at\nonce mystified and illuminated the remarkable performances of the lady\nin question.  Nowadays, in the management of his \"subject,\"\n\"clairvoyant,\" or \"medium,\" the exhibitor affects the simplicity and\nopenness of scientific experiment; and even if he profess to tread a\nstep or two across the boundaries of the spiritual world, yet carries\nwith him the laws of our actual life and extends them over his\npreternatural conquests.  Twelve or fifteen years ago, on the contrary,\nall the arts of mysterious arrangement, of picturesque disposition, and\nartistically contrasted light and shade, were made available, in order\nto set the apparent miracle in the strongest attitude of opposition to\nordinary facts.  In the case of the Veiled Lady, moreover, the interest\nof the spectator was further wrought up by the enigma of her identity,\nand an absurd rumor (probably set afloat by the exhibitor, and at one\ntime very prevalent) that a beautiful young lady, of family and\nfortune, was enshrouded within the misty drapery of the veil.  It was\nwhite, with somewhat of a subdued silver sheen, like the sunny side of\na cloud; and, falling over the wearer from head to foot, was supposed\nto insulate her from the material world, from time and space, and to\nendow her with many of the privileges of a disembodied spirit.\n\nHer pretensions, however, whether miraculous or otherwise, have little\nto do with the present narrative--except, indeed, that I had\npropounded, for the Veiled Lady's prophetic solution, a query as to the\nsuccess of our Blithedale enterprise.  The response, by the bye, was of\nthe true Sibylline stamp,--nonsensical in its first aspect, yet on\ncloser study unfolding a variety of interpretations, one of which has\ncertainly accorded with the event.  I was turning over this riddle in\nmy mind, and trying to catch its slippery purport by the tail, when the\nold man above mentioned interrupted me.\n\n\"Mr. Coverdale!--Mr. Coverdale!\" said he, repeating my name twice, in\norder to make up for the hesitating and ineffectual way in which he\nuttered it.  \"I ask your pardon, sir, but I hear you are going to\nBlithedale tomorrow.\"\n\nI knew the pale, elderly face, with the red-tipt nose, and the patch\nover one eye; and likewise saw something characteristic in the old\nfellow's way of standing under the arch of a gate, only revealing\nenough of himself to make me recognize him as an acquaintance.  He was\na very shy personage, this Mr. Moodie; and the trait was the more\nsingular, as his mode of getting his bread necessarily brought him into\nthe stir and hubbub of the world more than the generality of men.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Moodie,\" I answered, wondering what interest he could take in\nthe fact, \"it is my intention to go to Blithedale to-morrow.  Can I be\nof any service to you before my departure?\"\n\n\"If you pleased, Mr. Coverdale,\" said he, \"you might do me a very great\nfavor.\"\n\n\"A very great one?\" repeated I, in a tone that must have expressed but\nlittle alacrity of beneficence, although I was ready to do the old man\nany amount of kindness involving no special trouble to myself. \"A very\ngreat favor, do you say?  My time is brief, Mr. Moodie, and I have a\ngood many preparations to make.  But be good enough to tell me what you\nwish.\"\n\n\"Ah, sir,\" replied Old Moodie, \"I don't quite like to do that; and, on\nfurther thoughts, Mr. Coverdale, perhaps I had better apply to some\nolder gentleman, or to some lady, if you would have the kindness to\nmake me known to one, who may happen to be going to Blithedale. You are\na young man, sir!\"\n\n\"Does that fact lessen my availability for your purpose?\" asked I.\n\"However, if an older man will suit you better, there is Mr.\nHollingsworth, who has three or four years the advantage of me in age,\nand is a much more solid character, and a philanthropist to boot.  I am\nonly a poet, and, so the critics tell me, no great affair at that! But\nwhat can this business be, Mr. Moodie?  It begins to interest me;\nespecially since your hint that a lady's influence might be found\ndesirable.  Come, I am really anxious to be of service to you.\"\n\nBut the old fellow, in his civil and demure manner, was both freakish\nand obstinate; and he had now taken some notion or other into his head\nthat made him hesitate in his former design.\n\n\"I wonder, sir,\" said he, \"whether you know a lady whom they call\nZenobia?\"\n\n\"Not personally,\" I answered, \"although I expect that pleasure\nto-morrow, as she has got the start of the rest of us, and is already a\nresident at Blithedale.  But have you a literary turn, Mr. Moodie? or\nhave you taken up the advocacy of women's rights? or what else can have\ninterested you in this lady?  Zenobia, by the bye, as I suppose you\nknow, is merely her public name; a sort of mask in which she comes\nbefore the world, retaining all the privileges of privacy,--a\ncontrivance, in short, like the white drapery of the Veiled Lady, only\na little more transparent.  But it is late.  Will you tell me what I\ncan do for you?\"\n\n\"Please to excuse me to-night, Mr. Coverdale,\" said Moodie.  \"You are\nvery kind; but I am afraid I have troubled you, when, after all, there\nmay be no need.  Perhaps, with your good leave, I will come to your\nlodgings to-morrow morning, before you set out for Blithedale. I wish\nyou a good-night, sir, and beg pardon for stopping you.\"\n\nAnd so he slipt away; and, as he did not show himself the next morning,\nit was only through subsequent events that I ever arrived at a\nplausible conjecture as to what his business could have been. Arriving\nat my room, I threw a lump of cannel coal upon the grate, lighted a\ncigar, and spent an hour in musings of every hue, from the brightest to\nthe most sombre; being, in truth, not so very confident as at some\nformer periods that this final step, which would mix me up irrevocably\nwith the Blithedale affair, was the wisest that could possibly be\ntaken.  It was nothing short of midnight when I went to bed, after\ndrinking a glass of particularly fine sherry on which I used to pride\nmyself in those days.  It was the very last bottle; and I finished it,\nwith a friend, the next forenoon, before setting out for Blithedale.\n\n\n\nII. BLITHEDALE\n\nThere can hardly remain for me (who am really getting to be a frosty\nbachelor, with another white hair, every week or so, in my mustache),\nthere can hardly flicker up again so cheery a blaze upon the hearth, as\nthat which I remember, the next day, at Blithedale.  It was a wood\nfire, in the parlor of an old farmhouse, on an April afternoon, but\nwith the fitful gusts of a wintry snowstorm roaring in the chimney.\nVividly does that fireside re-create itself, as I rake away the ashes\nfrom the embers in my memory, and blow them up with a sigh, for lack of\nmore inspiring breath.  Vividly for an instant, but anon, with the\ndimmest gleam, and with just as little fervency for my heart as for my\nfinger-ends!  The staunch oaken logs were long ago burnt out. Their\ngenial glow must be represented, if at all, by the merest phosphoric\nglimmer, like that which exudes, rather than shines, from damp\nfragments of decayed trees, deluding the benighted wanderer through a\nforest.  Around such chill mockery of a fire some few of us might sit\non the withered leaves, spreading out each a palm towards the imaginary\nwarmth, and talk over our exploded scheme for beginning the life of\nParadise anew.\n\nParadise, indeed!  Nobody else in the world, I am bold to\naffirm--nobody, at least, in our bleak little world of New\nEngland,--had dreamed of Paradise that day except as the pole suggests\nthe tropic.  Nor, with such materials as were at hand, could the most\nskilful architect have constructed any better imitation of Eve's bower\nthan might be seen in the snow hut of an Esquimaux.  But we made a\nsummer of it, in spite of the wild drifts.\n\nIt was an April day, as already hinted, and well towards the middle of\nthe month.  When morning dawned upon me, in town, its temperature was\nmild enough to be pronounced even balmy, by a lodger, like myself, in\none of the midmost houses of a brick block,--each house partaking of\nthe warmth of all the rest, besides the sultriness of its individual\nfurnace--heat.  But towards noon there had come snow, driven along the\nstreet by a northeasterly blast, and whitening the roofs and sidewalks\nwith a business-like perseverance that would have done credit to our\nseverest January tempest.  It set about its task apparently as much in\nearnest as if it had been guaranteed from a thaw for months to come.\nThe greater, surely, was my heroism, when, puffing out a final whiff of\ncigar-smoke, I quitted my cosey pair of bachelor-rooms,--with a good\nfire burning in the grate, and a closet right at hand, where there was\nstill a bottle or two in the champagne basket and a residuum of claret\nin a box,--quitted, I say, these comfortable quarters, and plunged into\nthe heart of the pitiless snowstorm, in quest of a better life.\n\nThe better life!  Possibly, it would hardly look so now; it is enough\nif it looked so then.  The greatest obstacle to being heroic is the\ndoubt whether one may not be going to prove one's self a fool; the\ntruest heroism is to resist the doubt; and the profoundest wisdom to\nknow when it ought to be resisted, and when to be obeyed.\n\nYet, after all, let us acknowledge it wiser, if not more sagacious, to\nfollow out one's daydream to its natural consummation, although, if the\nvision have been worth the having, it is certain never to be\nconsummated otherwise than by a failure.  And what of that?  Its\nairiest fragments, impalpable as they may be, will possess a value that\nlurks not in the most ponderous realities of any practicable scheme.\nThey are not the rubbish of the mind.  Whatever else I may repent of,\ntherefore, let it be reckoned neither among my sins nor follies that I\nonce had faith and force enough to form generous hopes of the world's\ndestiny--yes!--and to do what in me lay for their accomplishment; even\nto the extent of quitting a warm fireside, flinging away a freshly\nlighted cigar, and travelling far beyond the strike of city clocks,\nthrough a drifting snowstorm.\n\nThere were four of us who rode together through the storm; and\nHollingsworth, who had agreed to be of the number, was accidentally\ndelayed, and set forth at a later hour alone.  As we threaded the\nstreets, I remember how the buildings on either side seemed to press\ntoo closely upon us, insomuch that our mighty hearts found barely room\nenough to throb between them.  The snowfall, too, looked inexpressibly\ndreary (I had almost called it dingy), coming down through an\natmosphere of city smoke, and alighting on the sidewalk only to be\nmoulded into the impress of somebody's patched boot or overshoe.  Thus\nthe track of an old conventionalism was visible on what was freshest\nfrom the sky.  But when we left the pavements, and our muffled\nhoof-tramps beat upon a desolate extent of country road, and were\neffaced by the unfettered blast as soon as stamped, then there was\nbetter air to breathe.  Air that had not been breathed once and again!\nair that had not been spoken into words of falsehood, formality, and\nerror, like all the air of the dusky city!\n\n\"How pleasant it is!\" remarked I, while the snowflakes flew into my\nmouth the moment it was opened.  \"How very mild and balmy is this\ncountry air!\"\n\n\"Ah, Coverdale, don't laugh at what little enthusiasm you have left!\"\nsaid one of my companions.  \"I maintain that this nitrous atmosphere is\nreally exhilarating; and, at any rate, we can never call ourselves\nregenerated men till a February northeaster shall be as grateful to us\nas the softest breeze of June!\"\n\nSo we all of us took courage, riding fleetly and merrily along, by\nstone fences that were half buried in the wave-like drifts; and through\npatches of woodland, where the tree-trunks opposed a snow-incrusted\nside towards the northeast; and within ken of deserted villas, with no\nfootprints in their avenues; and passed scattered dwellings, whence\npuffed the smoke of country fires, strongly impregnated with the\npungent aroma of burning peat.  Sometimes, encountering a traveller, we\nshouted a friendly greeting; and he, unmuffling his ears to the bluster\nand the snow-spray, and listening eagerly, appeared to think our\ncourtesy worth less than the trouble which it cost him.  The churl!  He\nunderstood the shrill whistle of the blast, but had no intelligence for\nour blithe tones of brotherhood.  This lack of faith in our cordial\nsympathy, on the traveller's part, was one among the innumerable tokens\nhow difficult a task we had in hand for the reformation of the world.\nWe rode on, however, with still unflagging spirits, and made such good\ncompanionship with the tempest that, at our journey's end, we professed\nourselves almost loath to bid the rude blusterer good-by. But, to own\nthe truth, I was little better than an icicle, and began to be\nsuspicious that I had caught a fearful cold.\n\nAnd now we were seated by the brisk fireside of the old farmhouse, the\nsame fire that glimmers so faintly among my reminiscences at the\nbeginning of this chapter.  There we sat, with the snow melting out of\nour hair and beards, and our faces all ablaze, what with the past\ninclemency and present warmth.  It was, indeed, a right good fire that\nwe found awaiting us, built up of great, rough logs, and knotty limbs,\nand splintered fragments of an oak-tree, such as farmers are wont to\nkeep for their own hearths, since these crooked and unmanageable boughs\ncould never be measured into merchantable cords for the market.  A\nfamily of the old Pilgrims might have swung their kettle over precisely\nsuch a fire as this, only, no doubt, a bigger one; and, contrasting it\nwith my coal-grate, I felt so much the more that we had transported\nourselves a world-wide distance from the system of society that\nshackled us at breakfast-time.\n\nGood, comfortable Mrs. Foster (the wife of stout Silas Foster, who was\nto manage the farm at a fair stipend, and be our tutor in the art of\nhusbandry) bade us a hearty welcome.  At her back--a back of generous\nbreadth--appeared two young women, smiling most hospitably, but looking\nrather awkward withal, as not well knowing what was to be their\nposition in our new arrangement of the world.  We shook hands\naffectionately all round, and congratulated ourselves that the blessed\nstate of brotherhood and sisterhood, at which we aimed, might fairly be\ndated from this moment.  Our greetings were hardly concluded when the\ndoor opened, and Zenobia--whom I had never before seen, important as\nwas her place in our enterprise--Zenobia entered the parlor.\n\nThis (as the reader, if at all acquainted with our literary biography,\nneed scarcely be told) was not her real name.  She had assumed it, in\nthe first instance, as her magazine signature; and, as it accorded well\nwith something imperial which her friends attributed to this lady's\nfigure and deportment, they half-laughingly adopted it in their\nfamiliar intercourse with her.  She took the appellation in good part,\nand even encouraged its constant use; which, in fact, was thus far\nappropriate, that our Zenobia, however humble looked her new\nphilosophy, had as much native pride as any queen would have known what\nto do with.\n\n\n\nIII. A KNOT OF DREAMERS\n\nZenobia bade us welcome, in a fine, frank, mellow voice, and gave each\nof us her hand, which was very soft and warm.  She had something\nappropriate, I recollect, to say to every individual; and what she said\nto myself was this:--\"I have long wished to know you, Mr. Coverdale,\nand to thank you for your beautiful poetry, some of which I have\nlearned by heart; or rather it has stolen into my memory, without my\nexercising any choice or volition about the matter.  Of course--permit\nme to say you do not think of relinquishing an occupation in which you\nhave done yourself so much credit.  I would almost rather give you up\nas an associate, than that the world should lose one of its true poets!\"\n\n\"Ah, no; there will not be the slightest danger of that, especially\nafter this inestimable praise from Zenobia,\" said I, smiling, and\nblushing, no doubt, with excess of pleasure.  \"I hope, on the contrary,\nnow to produce something that shall really deserve to be called\npoetry,--true, strong, natural, and sweet, as is the life which we are\ngoing to lead,--something that shall have the notes of wild birds\ntwittering through it, or a strain like the wind anthems in the woods,\nas the case may be.\"\n\n\"Is it irksome to you to hear your own verses sung?\" asked Zenobia,\nwith a gracious smile.  \"If so, I am very sorry, for you will certainly\nhear me singing them sometimes, in the summer evenings.\"\n\n\"Of all things,\" answered I, \"that is what will delight me most.\"\n\nWhile this passed, and while she spoke to my companions, I was taking\nnote of Zenobia's aspect; and it impressed itself on me so distinctly,\nthat I can now summon her up, like a ghost, a little wanner than the\nlife but otherwise identical with it.  She was dressed as simply as\npossible, in an American print (I think the dry-goods people call it\nso), but with a silken kerchief, between which and her gown there was\none glimpse of a white shoulder.  It struck me as a great piece of good\nfortune that there should be just that glimpse.  Her hair, which was\ndark, glossy, and of singular abundance, was put up rather soberly and\nprimly--without curls, or other ornament, except a single flower.  It\nwas an exotic of rare beauty, and as fresh as if the hothouse gardener\nhad just clipt it from the stem.  That flower has struck deep root into\nmy memory.  I can both see it and smell it, at this moment.  So\nbrilliant, so rare, so costly as it must have been, and yet enduring\nonly for a day, it was more indicative of the pride and pomp which had\na luxuriant growth in Zenobia's character than if a great diamond had\nsparkled among her hair.\n\nHer hand, though very soft, was larger than most women would like to\nhave, or than they could afford to have, though not a whit too large in\nproportion with the spacious plan of Zenobia's entire development. It\ndid one good to see a fine intellect (as hers really was, although its\nnatural tendency lay in another direction than towards literature) so\nfitly cased.  She was, indeed, an admirable figure of a woman, just on\nthe hither verge of her richest maturity, with a combination of\nfeatures which it is safe to call remarkably beautiful, even if some\nfastidious persons might pronounce them a little deficient in softness\nand delicacy.  But we find enough of those attributes everywhere.\nPreferable--by way of variety, at least--was Zenobia's bloom, health,\nand vigor, which she possessed in such overflow that a man might well\nhave fallen in love with her for their sake only.  In her quiet moods,\nshe seemed rather indolent; but when really in earnest, particularly if\nthere were a spice of bitter feeling, she grew all alive to her\nfinger-tips.\n\n\"I am the first comer,\" Zenobia went on to say, while her smile beamed\nwarmth upon us all; \"so I take the part of hostess for to-day, and\nwelcome you as if to my own fireside.  You shall be my guests, too, at\nsupper.  Tomorrow, if you please, we will be brethren and sisters, and\nbegin our new life from daybreak.\"\n\n\"Have we our various parts assigned?\" asked some one.\n\n\"Oh, we of the softer sex,\" responded Zenobia, with her mellow, almost\nbroad laugh,--most delectable to hear, but not in the least like an\nordinary woman's laugh,--\"we women (there are four of us here already)\nwill take the domestic and indoor part of the business, as a matter of\ncourse.  To bake, to boil, to roast, to fry, to stew,--to wash, and\niron, and scrub, and sweep,--and, at our idler intervals, to repose\nourselves on knitting and sewing,--these, I suppose, must be feminine\noccupations, for the present.  By and by, perhaps, when our individual\nadaptations begin to develop themselves, it may be that some of us who\nwear the petticoat will go afield, and leave the weaker brethren to\ntake our places in the kitchen.\"\n\n\"What a pity,\" I remarked, \"that the kitchen, and the housework\ngenerally, cannot be left out of our system altogether!  It is odd\nenough that the kind of labor which falls to the lot of women is just\nthat which chiefly distinguishes artificial life--the life of\ndegenerated mortals--from the life of Paradise.  Eve had no dinner-pot,\nand no clothes to mend, and no washing-day.\"\n\n\"I am afraid,\" said Zenobia, with mirth gleaming out of her eyes, \"we\nshall find some difficulty in adopting the paradisiacal system for at\nleast a month to come.  Look at that snowdrift sweeping past the\nwindow!  Are there any figs ripe, do you think?  Have the pineapples\nbeen gathered to-day?  Would you like a bread-fruit, or a cocoanut?\nShall I run out and pluck you some roses?  No, no, Mr. Coverdale; the\nonly flower hereabouts is the one in my hair, which I got out of a\ngreenhouse this morning.  As for the garb of Eden,\" added she,\nshivering playfully, \"I shall not assume it till after May-day!\"\n\nAssuredly Zenobia could not have intended it,--the fault must have been\nentirely in my imagination.  But these last words, together with\nsomething in her manner, irresistibly brought up a picture of that\nfine, perfectly developed figure, in Eve's earliest garment.  Her free,\ncareless, generous modes of expression often had this effect of\ncreating images which, though pure, are hardly felt to be quite\ndecorous when born of a thought that passes between man and woman.  I\nimputed it, at that time, to Zenobia's noble courage, conscious of no\nharm, and scorning the petty restraints which take the life and color\nout of other women's conversation.  There was another peculiarity about\nher.  We seldom meet with women nowadays, and in this country, who\nimpress us as being women at all,--their sex fades away and goes for\nnothing, in ordinary intercourse.  Not so with Zenobia.  One felt an\ninfluence breathing out of her such as we might suppose to come from\nEve, when she was just made, and her Creator brought her to Adam,\nsaying, \"Behold! here is a woman!\"  Not that I would convey the idea of\nespecial gentleness, grace, modesty, and shyness, but of a certain warm\nand rich characteristic, which seems, for the most part, to have been\nrefined away out of the feminine system.\n\n\"And now,\" continued Zenobia, \"I must go and help get supper.  Do you\nthink you can be content, instead of figs, pineapples, and all the\nother delicacies of Adam's supper-table, with tea and toast, and a\ncertain modest supply of ham and tongue, which, with the instinct of a\nhousewife, I brought hither in a basket?  And there shall be bread and\nmilk, too, if the innocence of your taste demands it.\"\n\nThe whole sisterhood now went about their domestic avocations, utterly\ndeclining our offers to assist, further than by bringing wood for the\nkitchen fire from a huge pile in the back yard.  After heaping up more\nthan a sufficient quantity, we returned to the sitting-room, drew our\nchairs close to the hearth, and began to talk over our prospects.\nSoon, with a tremendous stamping in the entry, appeared Silas Foster,\nlank, stalwart, uncouth, and grizzly-bearded. He came from foddering\nthe cattle in the barn, and from the field, where he had been\nploughing, until the depth of the snow rendered it impossible to draw a\nfurrow.  He greeted us in pretty much the same tone as if he were\nspeaking to his oxen, took a quid from his iron tobacco-box, pulled off\nhis wet cowhide boots, and sat down before the fire in his\nstocking-feet.  The steam arose from his soaked garments, so that the\nstout yeoman looked vaporous and spectre-like.\n\n\"Well, folks,\" remarked Silas, \"you'll be wishing yourselves back to\ntown again, if this weather holds.\"\n\nAnd, true enough, there was a look of gloom, as the twilight fell\nsilently and sadly out of the sky, its gray or sable flakes\nintermingling themselves with the fast-descending snow.  The storm, in\nits evening aspect, was decidedly dreary.  It seemed to have arisen for\nour especial behoof,--a symbol of the cold, desolate, distrustful\nphantoms that invariably haunt the mind, on the eve of adventurous\nenterprises, to warn us back within the boundaries of ordinary life.\n\nBut our courage did not quail.  We would not allow ourselves to be\ndepressed by the snowdrift trailing past the window, any more than if\nit had been the sigh of a summer wind among rustling boughs.  There\nhave been few brighter seasons for us than that.  If ever men might\nlawfully dream awake, and give utterance to their wildest visions\nwithout dread of laughter or scorn on the part of the audience,--yes,\nand speak of earthly happiness, for themselves and mankind, as an\nobject to be hopefully striven for, and probably attained, we who made\nthat little semicircle round the blazing fire were those very men.  We\nhad left the rusty iron framework of society behind us; we had broken\nthrough many hindrances that are powerful enough to keep most people on\nthe weary treadmill of the established system, even while they feel its\nirksomeness almost as intolerable as we did.  We had stepped down from\nthe pulpit; we had flung aside the pen; we had shut up the ledger; we\nhad thrown off that sweet, bewitching, enervating indolence, which is\nbetter, after all, than most of the enjoyments within mortal grasp.  It\nwas our purpose--a generous one, certainly, and absurd, no doubt, in\nfull proportion with its generosity--to give up whatever we had\nheretofore attained, for the sake of showing mankind the example of a\nlife governed by other than the false and cruel principles on which\nhuman society has all along been based.\n\nAnd, first of all, we had divorced ourselves from pride, and were\nstriving to supply its place with familiar love.  We meant to lessen\nthe laboring man's great burden of toil, by performing our due share of\nit at the cost of our own thews and sinews.  We sought our profit by\nmutual aid, instead of wresting it by the strong hand from an enemy, or\nfilching it craftily from those less shrewd than ourselves (if, indeed,\nthere were any such in New England), or winning it by selfish\ncompetition with a neighbor; in one or another of which fashions every\nson of woman both perpetrates and suffers his share of the common evil,\nwhether he chooses it or no.  And, as the basis of our institution, we\npurposed to offer up the earnest toil of our bodies, as a prayer no\nless than an effort for the advancement of our race.\n\nTherefore, if we built splendid castles (phalansteries perhaps they\nmight be more fitly called), and pictured beautiful scenes, among the\nfervid coals of the hearth around which we were clustering, and if all\nwent to rack with the crumbling embers and have never since arisen out\nof the ashes, let us take to ourselves no shame.  In my own behalf, I\nrejoice that I could once think better of the world's improvability\nthan it deserved.  It is a mistake into which men seldom fall twice in\na lifetime; or, if so, the rarer and higher is the nature that can thus\nmagnanimously persist in error.\n\nStout Silas Foster mingled little in our conversation; but when he did\nspeak, it was very much to some practical purpose.  For\ninstance:--\"Which man among you,\" quoth he, \"is the best judge of\nswine?  Some of us must go to the next Brighton fair, and buy half a\ndozen pigs.\"\n\nPigs!  Good heavens! had we come out from among the swinish multitude\nfor this?  And again, in reference to some discussion about raising\nearly vegetables for the market:--\"We shall never make any hand at\nmarket gardening,\" said Silas Foster, \"unless the women folks will\nundertake to do all the weeding.  We haven't team enough for that and\nthe regular farm-work, reckoning three of your city folks as worth one\ncommon field-hand.  No, no; I tell you, we should have to get up a\nlittle too early in the morning, to compete with the market gardeners\nround Boston.\"\n\nIt struck me as rather odd, that one of the first questions raised,\nafter our separation from the greedy, struggling, self-seeking world,\nshould relate to the possibility of getting the advantage over the\noutside barbarians in their own field of labor.  But, to own the truth,\nI very soon became sensible that, as regarded society at large, we\nstood in a position of new hostility, rather than new brotherhood. Nor\ncould this fail to be the case, in some degree, until the bigger and\nbetter half of society should range itself on our side. Constituting so\npitiful a minority as now, we were inevitably estranged from the rest\nof mankind in pretty fair proportion with the strictness of our mutual\nbond among ourselves.\n\nThis dawning idea, however, was driven back into my inner consciousness\nby the entrance of Zenobia.  She came with the welcome intelligence\nthat supper was on the table.  Looking at herself in the glass, and\nperceiving that her one magnificent flower had grown rather languid\n(probably by being exposed to the fervency of the kitchen fire), she\nflung it on the floor, as unconcernedly as a village girl would throw\naway a faded violet.  The action seemed proper to her character,\nalthough, methought, it would still more have befitted the bounteous\nnature of this beautiful woman to scatter fresh flowers from her hand,\nand to revive faded ones by her touch. Nevertheless, it was a singular\nbut irresistible effect; the presence of Zenobia caused our heroic\nenterprise to show like an illusion, a masquerade, a pastoral, a\ncounterfeit Arcadia, in which we grown-up men and women were making a\nplay-day of the years that were given us to live in.  I tried to\nanalyze this impression, but not with much success.\n\n\"It really vexes me,\" observed Zenobia, as we left the room, \"that Mr.\nHollingsworth should be such a laggard.  I should not have thought him\nat all the sort of person to be turned back by a puff of contrary wind,\nor a few snowflakes drifting into his face.\"\n\n\"Do you know Hollingsworth personally?\"  I inquired.\n\n\"No; only as an auditor--auditress, I mean--of some of his lectures,\"\nsaid she.  \"What a voice he has! and what a man he is!  Yet not so much\nan intellectual man, I should say, as a great heart; at least, he moved\nme more deeply than I think myself capable of being moved, except by\nthe stroke of a true, strong heart against my own.  It is a sad pity\nthat he should have devoted his glorious powers to such a grimy,\nunbeautiful, and positively hopeless object as this reformation of\ncriminals, about which he makes himself and his wretchedly small\naudiences so very miserable.  To tell you a secret, I never could\ntolerate a philanthropist before.  Could you?\"\n\n\"By no means,\" I answered; \"neither can I now.\"\n\n\"They are, indeed, an odiously disagreeable set of mortals,\" continued\nZenobia.  \"I should like Mr. Hollingsworth a great deal better if the\nphilanthropy had been left out.  At all events, as a mere matter of\ntaste, I wish he would let the bad people alone, and try to benefit\nthose who are not already past his help.  Do you suppose he will be\ncontent to spend his life, or even a few months of it, among tolerably\nvirtuous and comfortable individuals like ourselves?\"\n\n\"Upon my word, I doubt it,\" said I. \"If we wish to keep him with us, we\nmust systematically commit at least one crime apiece!  Mere peccadillos\nwill not satisfy him.\"\n\nZenobia turned, sidelong, a strange kind of a glance upon me; but,\nbefore I could make out what it meant, we had entered the kitchen,\nwhere, in accordance with the rustic simplicity of our new life, the\nsupper-table was spread.\n\n\n\nIV. THE SUPPER-TABLE\n\nThe pleasant firelight!  I must still keep harping on it.  The kitchen\nhearth had an old-fashioned breadth, depth, and spaciousness, far\nwithin which lay what seemed the butt of a good-sized oak-tree, with\nthe moisture bubbling merrily out at both ends.  It was now half an\nhour beyond dusk.  The blaze from an armful of substantial sticks,\nrendered more combustible by brushwood and pine, flickered powerfully\non the smoke-blackened walls, and so cheered our spirits that we cared\nnot what inclemency might rage and roar on the other side of our\nilluminated windows.  A yet sultrier warmth was bestowed by a goodly\nquantity of peat, which was crumbling to white ashes among the burning\nbrands, and incensed the kitchen with its not ungrateful fragrance.\nThe exuberance of this household fire would alone have sufficed to\nbespeak us no true farmers; for the New England yeoman, if he have the\nmisfortune to dwell within practicable distance of a wood-market, is as\nniggardly of each stick as if it were a bar of California gold.\n\nBut it was fortunate for us, on that wintry eve of our untried life, to\nenjoy the warm and radiant luxury of a somewhat too abundant fire. If\nit served no other purpose, it made the men look so full of youth, warm\nblood, and hope, and the women--such of them, at least, as were anywise\nconvertible by its magic--so very beautiful, that I would cheerfully\nhave spent my last dollar to prolong the blaze.  As for Zenobia, there\nwas a glow in her cheeks that made me think of Pandora, fresh from\nVulcan's workshop, and full of the celestial warmth by dint of which he\nhad tempered and moulded her.\n\n\"Take your places, my dear friends all,\" cried she; \"seat yourselves\nwithout ceremony, and you shall be made happy with such tea as not many\nof the world's working-people, except yourselves, will find in their\ncups to-night.  After this one supper, you may drink buttermilk, if you\nplease.  To-night we will quaff this nectar, which, I assure you, could\nnot be bought with gold.\"\n\nWe all sat down,--grizzly Silas Foster, his rotund helpmate, and the\ntwo bouncing handmaidens, included,--and looked at one another in a\nfriendly but rather awkward way.  It was the first practical trial of\nour theories of equal brotherhood and sisterhood; and we people of\nsuperior cultivation and refinement (for as such, I presume, we\nunhesitatingly reckoned ourselves) felt as if something were already\naccomplished towards the millennium of love.  The truth is, however,\nthat the laboring oar was with our unpolished companions; it being far\neasier to condescend than to accept of condescension.  Neither did I\nrefrain from questioning, in secret, whether some of us--and Zenobia\namong the rest--would so quietly have taken our places among these good\npeople, save for the cherished consciousness that it was not by\nnecessity but choice.  Though we saw fit to drink our tea out of\nearthen cups to-night, and in earthen company, it was at our own option\nto use pictured porcelain and handle silver forks again to-morrow.\nThis same salvo, as to the power of regaining our former position,\ncontributed much, I fear, to the equanimity with which we subsequently\nbore many of the hardships and humiliations of a life of toil.  If ever\nI have deserved (which has not often been the case, and, I think,\nnever), but if ever I did deserve to be soundly cuffed by a fellow\nmortal, for secretly putting weight upon some imaginary social\nadvantage, it must have been while I was striving to prove myself\nostentatiously his equal and no more.  It was while I sat beside him on\nhis cobbler's bench, or clinked my hoe against his own in the\ncornfield, or broke the same crust of bread, my earth-grimed hand to\nhis, at our noontide lunch.  The poor, proud man should look at both\nsides of sympathy like this.\n\nThe silence which followed upon our sitting down to table grew rather\noppressive; indeed, it was hardly broken by a word, during the first\nround of Zenobia's fragrant tea.\n\n\"I hope,\" said I, at last, \"that our blazing windows will be visible a\ngreat way off.  There is nothing so pleasant and encouraging to a\nsolitary traveller, on a stormy night, as a flood of firelight seen\namid the gloom.  These ruddy window panes cannot fail to cheer the\nhearts of all that look at them.  Are they not warm with the\nbeacon-fire which we have kindled for humanity?\"\n\n\"The blaze of that brushwood will only last a minute or two longer,\"\nobserved Silas Foster; but whether he meant to insinuate that our moral\nillumination would have as brief a term, I cannot say.\n\n\"Meantime,\" said Zenobia, \"it may serve to guide some wayfarer to a\nshelter.\"\n\nAnd, just as she said this, there came a knock at the house door.\n\n\"There is one of the world's wayfarers,\" said I. \"Ay, ay, just so!\"\nquoth Silas Foster.  \"Our firelight will draw stragglers, just as a\ncandle draws dorbugs on a summer night.\"\n\nWhether to enjoy a dramatic suspense, or that we were selfishly\ncontrasting our own comfort with the chill and dreary situation of the\nunknown person at the threshold, or that some of us city folk felt a\nlittle startled at the knock which came so unseasonably, through night\nand storm, to the door of the lonely farmhouse,--so it happened that\nnobody, for an instant or two, arose to answer the summons.  Pretty\nsoon there came another knock.  The first had been moderately loud; the\nsecond was smitten so forcibly that the knuckles of the applicant must\nhave left their mark in the door panel.\n\n\"He knocks as if he had a right to come in,\" said Zenobia, laughing.\n\"And what are we thinking of?--It must be Mr. Hollingsworth!\"\n\nHereupon I went to the door, unbolted, and flung it wide open.  There,\nsure enough, stood Hollingsworth, his shaggy greatcoat all covered with\nsnow, so that he looked quite as much like a polar bear as a modern\nphilanthropist.\n\n\"Sluggish hospitality this!\" said he, in those deep tones of his, which\nseemed to come out of a chest as capacious as a barrel.  \"It would have\nserved you right if I had lain down and spent the night on the\ndoorstep, just for the sake of putting you to shame.  But here is a\nguest who will need a warmer and softer bed.\"\n\nAnd, stepping back to the wagon in which he had journeyed hither,\nHollingsworth received into his arms and deposited on the doorstep a\nfigure enveloped in a cloak.  It was evidently a woman; or,\nrather,--judging from the ease with which he lifted her, and the little\nspace which she seemed to fill in his arms, a slim and unsubstantial\ngirl.  As she showed some hesitation about entering the door,\nHollingsworth, with his usual directness and lack of ceremony, urged\nher forward not merely within the entry, but into the warm and strongly\nlighted kitchen.\n\n\"Who is this?\" whispered I, remaining behind with him, while he was\ntaking off his greatcoat.\n\n\"Who?  Really, I don't know,\" answered Hollingsworth, looking at me\nwith some surprise.  \"It is a young person who belongs here, however;\nand no doubt she had been expected.  Zenobia, or some of the women\nfolks, can tell you all about it.\"\n\n\"I think not,\" said I, glancing towards the new-comer and the other\noccupants of the kitchen.  \"Nobody seems to welcome her.  I should\nhardly judge that she was an expected guest.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said Hollingsworth quietly, \"We'll make it right.\"\n\nThe stranger, or whatever she were, remained standing precisely on that\nspot of the kitchen floor to which Hollingsworth's kindly hand had\nimpelled her.  The cloak falling partly off, she was seen to be a very\nyoung woman dressed in a poor but decent gown, made high in the neck,\nand without any regard to fashion or smartness.  Her brown hair fell\ndown from beneath a hood, not in curls but with only a slight wave; her\nface was of a wan, almost sickly hue, betokening habitual seclusion\nfrom the sun and free atmosphere, like a flower-shrub that had done its\nbest to blossom in too scanty light.  To complete the pitiableness of\nher aspect, she shivered either with cold, or fear, or nervous\nexcitement, so that you might have beheld her shadow vibrating on the\nfire-lighted wall.  In short, there has seldom been seen so depressed\nand sad a figure as this young girl's; and it was hardly possible to\nhelp being angry with her, from mere despair of doing anything for her\ncomfort.  The fantasy occurred to me that she was some desolate kind of\na creature, doomed to wander about in snowstorms; and that, though the\nruddiness of our window panes had tempted her into a human dwelling,\nshe would not remain long enough to melt the icicles out of her hair.\nAnother conjecture likewise came into my mind.  Recollecting\nHollingsworth's sphere of philanthropic action, I deemed it possible\nthat he might have brought one of his guilty patients, to be wrought\nupon and restored to spiritual health by the pure influences which our\nmode of life would create.\n\nAs yet the girl had not stirred.  She stood near the door, fixing a\npair of large, brown, melancholy eyes upon Zenobia--only upon\nZenobia!--she evidently saw nothing else in the room save that bright,\nfair, rosy, beautiful woman.  It was the strangest look I ever\nwitnessed; long a mystery to me, and forever a memory.  Once she seemed\nabout to move forward and greet her,--I know not with what warmth or\nwith what words,--but, finally, instead of doing so, she dropped down\nupon her knees, clasped her hands, and gazed piteously into Zenobia's\nface. Meeting no kindly reception, her head fell on her bosom.\n\nI never thoroughly forgave Zenobia for her conduct on this occasion.\nBut women are always more cautious in their casual hospitalities than\nmen.\n\n\"What does the girl mean?\" cried she in rather a sharp tone.  \"Is she\ncrazy?  Has she no tongue?\"\n\nAnd here Hollingsworth stepped forward.\n\n\"No wonder if the poor child's tongue is frozen in her mouth,\" said he;\nand I think he positively frowned at Zenobia.  \"The very heart will be\nfrozen in her bosom, unless you women can warm it, among you, with the\nwarmth that ought to be in your own!\"\n\nHollingsworth's appearance was very striking at this moment.  He was\nthen about thirty years old, but looked several years older, with his\ngreat shaggy head, his heavy brow, his dark complexion, his abundant\nbeard, and the rude strength with which his features seemed to have\nbeen hammered out of iron, rather than chiselled or moulded from any\nfiner or softer material.  His figure was not tall, but massive and\nbrawny, and well befitting his original occupation; which as the reader\nprobably knows--was that of a blacksmith.  As for external polish, or\nmere courtesy of manner, he never possessed more than a tolerably\neducated bear; although, in his gentler moods, there was a tenderness\nin his voice, eyes, mouth, in his gesture, and in every indescribable\nmanifestation, which few men could resist and no woman. But he now\nlooked stern and reproachful; and it was with that inauspicious meaning\nin his glance that Hollingsworth first met Zenobia's eyes, and began\nhis influence upon her life.\n\nTo my surprise, Zenobia--of whose haughty spirit I had been told so\nmany examples--absolutely changed color, and seemed mortified and\nconfused.\n\n\"You do not quite do me justice, Mr. Hollingsworth,\" said she almost\nhumbly.  \"I am willing to be kind to the poor girl.  Is she a protegee\nof yours?  What can I do for her?\"\n\n\"Have you anything to ask of this lady?\" said Hollingsworth kindly to\nthe girl.  \"I remember you mentioned her name before we left town.\"\n\n\"Only that she will shelter me,\" replied the girl tremulously.  \"Only\nthat she will let me be always near her.\"\n\n\"Well, indeed,\" exclaimed Zenobia, recovering herself and laughing,\n\"this is an adventure, and well-worthy to be the first incident in our\nlife of love and free-heartedness!  But I accept it, for the present,\nwithout further question, only,\" added she, \"it would be a convenience\nif we knew your name.\"\n\n\"Priscilla,\" said the girl; and it appeared to me that she hesitated\nwhether to add anything more, and decided in the negative.  \"Pray do\nnot ask me my other name,--at least not yet,--if you will be so kind to\na forlorn creature.\"\n\nPriscilla!--Priscilla!  I repeated the name to myself three or four\ntimes; and in that little space, this quaint and prim cognomen had so\namalgamated itself with my idea of the girl, that it seemed as if no\nother name could have adhered to her for a moment.  Heretofore the poor\nthing had not shed any tears; but now that she found herself received,\nand at least temporarily established, the big drops began to ooze out\nfrom beneath her eyelids as if she were full of them. Perhaps it showed\nthe iron substance of my heart, that I could not help smiling at this\nodd scene of unknown and unaccountable calamity, into which our\ncheerful party had been entrapped without the liberty of choosing\nwhether to sympathize or no.  Hollingsworth's behavior was certainly a\ngreat deal more creditable than mine.\n\n\"Let us not pry further into her secrets,\" he said to Zenobia and the\nrest of us, apart; and his dark, shaggy face looked really beautiful\nwith its expression of thoughtful benevolence.  \"Let us conclude that\nProvidence has sent her to us, as the first-fruits of the world, which\nwe have undertaken to make happier than we find it.  Let us warm her\npoor, shivering body with this good fire, and her poor, shivering heart\nwith our best kindness.  Let us feed her, and make her one of us.  As\nwe do by this friendless girl, so shall we prosper. And, in good time,\nwhatever is desirable for us to know will be melted out of her, as\ninevitably as those tears which we see now.\"\n\n\"At least,\" remarked I, \"you may tell us how and where you met with\nher.\"\n\n\"An old man brought her to my lodgings,\" answered Hollingsworth, \"and\nbegged me to convey her to Blithedale, where--so I understood him--she\nhad friends; and this is positively all I know about the matter.\"\n\nGrim Silas Foster, all this while, had been busy at the supper-table,\npouring out his own tea and gulping it down with no more sense of its\nexquisiteness than if it were a decoction of catnip; helping himself to\npieces of dipt toast on the flat of his knife blade, and dropping half\nof it on the table-cloth; using the same serviceable implement to cut\nslice after slice of ham; perpetrating terrible enormities with the\nbutter-plate; and in all other respects behaving less like a civilized\nChristian than the worst kind of an ogre.  Being by this time fully\ngorged, he crowned his amiable exploits with a draught from the water\npitcher, and then favored us with his opinion about the business in\nhand.  And, certainly, though they proceeded out of an unwiped mouth,\nhis expressions did him honor.\n\n\"Give the girl a hot cup of tea and a thick slice of this first-rate\nbacon,\" said Silas, like a sensible man as he was.  \"That's what she\nwants.  Let her stay with us as long as she likes, and help in the\nkitchen, and take the cow-breath at milking time; and, in a week or\ntwo, she'll begin to look like a creature of this world.\"\n\nSo we sat down again to supper, and Priscilla along with us.\n\n\n\nV. UNTIL BEDTIME\n\nSilas Foster, by the time we concluded our meal, had stript off his\ncoat, and planted himself on a low chair by the kitchen fire, with a\nlapstone, a hammer, a piece of sole leather, and some waxed-ends, in\norder to cobble an old pair of cowhide boots; he being, in his own\nphrase, \"something of a dab\" (whatever degree of skill that may imply)\nat the shoemaking business.  We heard the tap of his hammer at\nintervals for the rest of the evening.  The remainder of the party\nadjourned to the sitting-room.  Good Mrs. Foster took her\nknitting-work, and soon fell fast asleep, still keeping her needles in\nbrisk movement, and, to the best of my observation, absolutely footing\na stocking out of the texture of a dream.  And a very substantial\nstocking it seemed to be.  One of the two handmaidens hemmed a towel,\nand the other appeared to be making a ruffle, for her Sunday's wear,\nout of a little bit of embroidered muslin which Zenobia had probably\ngiven her.\n\nIt was curious to observe how trustingly, and yet how timidly, our poor\nPriscilla betook herself into the shadow of Zenobia's protection. She\nsat beside her on a stool, looking up every now and then with an\nexpression of humble delight at her new friend's beauty.  A brilliant\nwoman is often an object of the devoted admiration--it might almost be\ntermed worship, or idolatry--of some young girl, who perhaps beholds\nthe cynosure only at an awful distance, and has as little hope of\npersonal intercourse as of climbing among the stars of heaven.  We men\nare too gross to comprehend it.  Even a woman, of mature age, despises\nor laughs at such a passion.  There occurred to me no mode of\naccounting for Priscilla's behavior, except by supposing that she had\nread some of Zenobia's stories (as such literature goes everywhere), or\nher tracts in defence of the sex, and had come hither with the one\npurpose of being her slave.  There is nothing parallel to this, I\nbelieve,--nothing so foolishly disinterested, and hardly anything so\nbeautiful,--in the masculine nature, at whatever epoch of life; or, if\nthere be, a fine and rare development of character might reasonably be\nlooked for from the youth who should prove himself capable of such\nself-forgetful affection.\n\nZenobia happening to change her seat, I took the opportunity, in an\nundertone, to suggest some such notion as the above.\n\n\"Since you see the young woman in so poetical a light,\" replied she in\nthe same tone, \"you had better turn the affair into a ballad.  It is a\ngrand subject, and worthy of supernatural machinery.  The storm, the\nstartling knock at the door, the entrance of the sable knight\nHollingsworth and this shadowy snow-maiden, who, precisely at the\nstroke of midnight, shall melt away at my feet in a pool of ice-cold\nwater and give me my death with a pair of wet slippers!  And when the\nverses are written, and polished quite to your mind, I will favor you\nwith my idea as to what the girl really is.\"\n\n\"Pray let me have it now,\" said I; \"it shall be woven into the ballad.\"\n\n\"She is neither more nor less,\" answered Zenobia, \"than a seamstress\nfrom the city; and she has probably no more transcendental purpose than\nto do my miscellaneous sewing, for I suppose she will hardly expect to\nmake my dresses.\"\n\n\"How can you decide upon her so easily?\"  I inquired.\n\n\"Oh, we women judge one another by tokens that escape the obtuseness of\nmasculine perceptions!\" said Zenobia.  \"There is no proof which you\nwould be likely to appreciate, except the needle marks on the tip of\nher forefinger.  Then, my supposition perfectly accounts for her\npaleness, her nervousness, and her wretched fragility.  Poor thing! She\nhas been stifled with the heat of a salamander stove, in a small, close\nroom, and has drunk coffee, and fed upon doughnuts, raisins, candy, and\nall such trash, till she is scarcely half alive; and so, as she has\nhardly any physique, a poet like Mr. Miles Coverdale may be allowed to\nthink her spiritual.\"\n\n\"Look at her now!\" whispered I.\n\nPriscilla was gazing towards us with an inexpressible sorrow in her wan\nface and great tears running down her cheeks.  It was difficult to\nresist the impression that, cautiously as we had lowered our voices,\nshe must have overheard and been wounded by Zenobia's scornful estimate\nof her character and purposes.\n\n\"What ears the girl must have!\" whispered Zenobia, with a look of\nvexation, partly comic and partly real.  \"I will confess to you that I\ncannot quite make her out.  However, I am positively not an ill-natured\nperson, unless when very grievously provoked,--and as you, and\nespecially Mr. Hollingsworth, take so much interest in this odd\ncreature, and as she knocks with a very slight tap against my own heart\nlikewise,--why, I mean to let her in.  From this moment I will be\nreasonably kind to her.  There is no pleasure in tormenting a person of\none's own sex, even if she do favor one with a little more love than\none can conveniently dispose of; and that, let me say, Mr. Coverdale,\nis the most troublesome offence you can offer to a woman.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said I, smiling; \"I don't mean to be guilty of it.\"\n\nShe went towards Priscilla, took her hand, and passed her own rosy\nfinger-tips, with a pretty, caressing movement, over the girl's hair.\nThe touch had a magical effect.  So vivid a look of joy flushed up\nbeneath those fingers, that it seemed as if the sad and wan Priscilla\nhad been snatched away, and another kind of creature substituted in her\nplace.  This one caress, bestowed voluntarily by Zenobia, was evidently\nreceived as a pledge of all that the stranger sought from her, whatever\nthe unuttered boon might be.  From that instant, too, she melted in\nquietly amongst us, and was no longer a foreign element. Though always\nan object of peculiar interest, a riddle, and a theme of frequent\ndiscussion, her tenure at Blithedale was thenceforth fixed.  We no more\nthought of questioning it, than if Priscilla had been recognized as a\ndomestic sprite, who had haunted the rustic fireside of old, before we\nhad ever been warmed by its blaze.\n\nShe now produced, out of a work-bag that she had with her, some little\nwooden instruments (what they are called I never knew), and proceeded\nto knit, or net, an article which ultimately took the shape of a silk\npurse.  As the work went on, I remembered to have seen just such purses\nbefore; indeed, I was the possessor of one.  Their peculiar excellence,\nbesides the great delicacy and beauty of the manufacture, lay in the\nalmost impossibility that any uninitiated person should discover the\naperture; although, to a practised touch, they would open as wide as\ncharity or prodigality might wish.  I wondered if it were not a symbol\nof Priscilla's own mystery.\n\nNotwithstanding the new confidence with which Zenobia had inspired her,\nour guest showed herself disquieted by the storm.  When the strong\npuffs of wind spattered the snow against the windows and made the oaken\nframe of the farmhouse creak, she looked at us apprehensively, as if to\ninquire whether these tempestuous outbreaks did not betoken some\nunusual mischief in the shrieking blast.  She had been bred up, no\ndoubt, in some close nook, some inauspiciously sheltered court of the\ncity, where the uttermost rage of a tempest, though it might scatter\ndown the slates of the roof into the bricked area, could not shake the\ncasement of her little room.  The sense of vast, undefined space,\npressing from the outside against the black panes of our uncurtained\nwindows, was fearful to the poor girl, heretofore accustomed to the\nnarrowness of human limits, with the lamps of neighboring tenements\nglimmering across the street.  The house probably seemed to her adrift\non the great ocean of the night. A little parallelogram of sky was all\nthat she had hitherto known of nature, so that she felt the awfulness\nthat really exists in its limitless extent.  Once, while the blast was\nbellowing, she caught hold of Zenobia's robe, with precisely the air of\none who hears her own name spoken at a distance, but is unutterably\nreluctant to obey the call.\n\nWe spent rather an incommunicative evening.  Hollingsworth hardly said\na word, unless when repeatedly and pertinaciously addressed. Then,\nindeed, he would glare upon us from the thick shrubbery of his\nmeditations like a tiger out of a jungle, make the briefest reply\npossible, and betake himself back into the solitude of his heart and\nmind.  The poor fellow had contracted this ungracious habit from the\nintensity with which he contemplated his own ideas, and the infrequent\nsympathy which they met with from his auditors,--a circumstance that\nseemed only to strengthen the implicit confidence that he awarded to\nthem.  His heart, I imagine, was never really interested in our\nsocialist scheme, but was forever busy with his strange, and, as most\npeople thought it, impracticable plan, for the reformation of criminals\nthrough an appeal to their higher instincts.\n\nMuch as I liked Hollingsworth, it cost me many a groan to tolerate him\non this point.  He ought to have commenced his investigation of the\nsubject by perpetrating some huge sin in his proper person, and\nexamining the condition of his higher instincts afterwards.\n\nThe rest of us formed ourselves into a committee for providing our\ninfant community with an appropriate name,--a matter of greatly more\ndifficulty than the uninitiated reader would suppose.  Blithedale was\nneither good nor bad.  We should have resumed the old Indian name of\nthe premises, had it possessed the oil-and-honey flow which the\naborigines were so often happy in communicating to their local\nappellations; but it chanced to be a harsh, ill-connected, and\ninterminable word, which seemed to fill the mouth with a mixture of\nvery stiff clay and very crumbly pebbles.  Zenobia suggested \"Sunny\nGlimpse,\" as expressive of a vista into a better system of society.\nThis we turned over and over for a while, acknowledging its prettiness,\nbut concluded it to be rather too fine and sentimental a name (a fault\ninevitable by literary ladies in such attempts) for sunburnt men to\nwork under.  I ventured to whisper \"Utopia,\" which, however, was\nunanimously scouted down, and the proposer very harshly maltreated, as\nif he had intended a latent satire.  Some were for calling our\ninstitution \"The Oasis,\" in view of its being the one green spot in the\nmoral sand-waste of the world; but others insisted on a proviso for\nreconsidering the matter at a twelvemonths' end, when a final decision\nmight be had, whether to name it \"The Oasis\" or \"Sahara.\"  So, at last,\nfinding it impracticable to hammer out anything better, we resolved\nthat the spot should still be Blithedale, as being of good augury\nenough.\n\nThe evening wore on, and the outer solitude looked in upon us through\nthe windows, gloomy, wild, and vague, like another state of existence,\nclose beside the little sphere of warmth and light in which we were the\nprattlers and bustlers of a moment.  By and by the door was opened by\nSilas Foster, with a cotton handkerchief about his head, and a tallow\ncandle in his hand.\n\n\"Take my advice, brother farmers,\" said he, with a great, broad,\nbottomless yawn, \"and get to bed as soon as you can.  I shall sound the\nhorn at daybreak; and we've got the cattle to fodder, and nine cows to\nmilk, and a dozen other things to do, before breakfast.\"\n\nThus ended the first evening at Blithedale.  I went shivering to my\nfireless chamber, with the miserable consciousness (which had been\ngrowing upon me for several hours past) that I had caught a tremendous\ncold, and should probably awaken, at the blast of the horn, a fit\nsubject for a hospital.  The night proved a feverish one. During the\ngreater part of it, I was in that vilest of states when a fixed idea\nremains in the mind, like the nail in Sisera's brain, while innumerable\nother ideas go and come, and flutter to and fro, combining constant\ntransition with intolerable sameness.  Had I made a record of that\nnight's half-waking dreams, it is my belief that it would have\nanticipated several of the chief incidents of this narrative, including\na dim shadow of its catastrophe.  Starting up in bed at length, I saw\nthat the storm was past, and the moon was shining on the snowy\nlandscape, which looked like a lifeless copy of the world in marble.\n\nFrom the bank of the distant river, which was shimmering in the\nmoonlight, came the black shadow of the only cloud in heaven, driven\nswiftly by the wind, and passing over meadow and hillock, vanishing\namid tufts of leafless trees, but reappearing on the hither side, until\nit swept across our doorstep.\n\nHow cold an Arcadia was this!\n\n\n\nVI. COVERDALE'S SICK-CHAMBER\n\nThe horn sounded at daybreak, as Silas Foster had forewarned us, harsh,\nuproarious, inexorably drawn out, and as sleep-dispelling as if this\nhard-hearted old yeoman had got hold of the trump of doom.\n\nOn all sides I could hear the creaking of the bedsteads, as the\nbrethren of Blithedale started from slumber, and thrust themselves into\ntheir habiliments, all awry, no doubt, in their haste to begin the\nreformation of the world.  Zenobia put her head into the entry, and\nbesought Silas Foster to cease his clamor, and to be kind enough to\nleave an armful of firewood and a pail of water at her chamber door.\nOf the whole household,--unless, indeed, it were Priscilla, for whose\nhabits, in this particular, I cannot vouch,--of all our apostolic\nsociety, whose mission was to bless mankind, Hollingsworth, I\napprehend, was the only one who began the enterprise with prayer. My\nsleeping-room being but thinly partitioned from his, the solemn murmur\nof his voice made its way to my ears, compelling me to be an auditor of\nhis awful privacy with the Creator.  It affected me with a deep\nreverence for Hollingsworth, which no familiarity then existing, or\nthat afterwards grew more intimate between us,--no, nor my subsequent\nperception of his own great errors,--ever quite effaced. It is so rare,\nin these times, to meet with a man of prayerful habits (except, of\ncourse, in the pulpit), that such an one is decidedly marked out by the\nlight of transfiguration, shed upon him in the divine interview from\nwhich he passes into his daily life.\n\nAs for me, I lay abed; and if I said my prayers, it was backward,\ncursing my day as bitterly as patient Job himself.  The truth was, the\nhot-house warmth of a town residence, and the luxurious life in which I\nindulged myself, had taken much of the pith out of my physical system;\nand the wintry blast of the preceding day, together with the general\nchill of our airy old farmhouse, had got fairly into my heart and the\nmarrow of my bones.  In this predicament, I seriously wished--selfish\nas it may appear--that the reformation of society had been postponed\nabout half a century, or, at all events, to such a date as should have\nput my intermeddling with it entirely out of the question.\n\nWhat, in the name of common-sense, had I to do with any better society\nthan I had always lived in?  It had satisfied me well enough. My\npleasant bachelor-parlor, sunny and shadowy, curtained and carpeted,\nwith the bedchamber adjoining; my centre-table, strewn with books and\nperiodicals; my writing-desk with a half-finished poem, in a stanza of\nmy own contrivance; my morning lounge at the reading-room or picture\ngallery; my noontide walk along the cheery pavement, with the\nsuggestive succession of human faces, and the brisk throb of human life\nin which I shared; my dinner at the Albion, where I had a hundred\ndishes at command, and could banquet as delicately as the wizard\nMichael Scott when the Devil fed him from the king of France's kitchen;\nmy evening at the billiard club, the concert, the theatre, or at\nsomebody's party, if I pleased,--what could be better than all this?\nWas it better to hoe, to mow, to toil and moil amidst the accumulations\nof a barnyard; to be the chambermaid of two yoke of oxen and a dozen\ncows; to eat salt beef, and earn it with the sweat of my brow, and\nthereby take the tough morsel out of some wretch's mouth, into whose\nvocation I had thrust myself?  Above all, was it better to have a fever\nand die blaspheming, as I was like to do?\n\nIn this wretched plight, with a furnace in my heart and another in my\nhead, by the heat of which I was kept constantly at the boiling point,\nyet shivering at the bare idea of extruding so much as a finger into\nthe icy atmosphere of the room, I kept my bed until breakfast-time,\nwhen Hollingsworth knocked at the door, and entered.\n\n\"Well, Coverdale,\" cried he, \"you bid fair to make an admirable farmer!\nDon't you mean to get up to-day?\"\n\n\"Neither to-day nor to-morrow,\" said I hopelessly.  \"I doubt if I ever\nrise again!\"\n\n\"What is the matter now?\" he asked.\n\nI told him my piteous case, and besought him to send me back to town in\na close carriage.\n\n\"No, no!\" said Hollingsworth with kindly seriousness.  \"If you are\nreally sick, we must take care of you.\"\n\nAccordingly he built a fire in my chamber, and, having little else to\ndo while the snow lay on the ground, established himself as my nurse. A\ndoctor was sent for, who, being homaeopathic, gave me as much medicine,\nin the course of a fortnight's attendance, as would have laid on the\npoint of a needle.  They fed me on water-gruel, and I speedily became a\nskeleton above ground.  But, after all, I have many precious\nrecollections connected with that fit of sickness.\n\nHollingsworth's more than brotherly attendance gave me inexpressible\ncomfort.  Most men--and certainly I could not always claim to be one of\nthe exceptions--have a natural indifference, if not an absolutely\nhostile feeling, towards those whom disease, or weakness, or calamity\nof any kind causes to falter and faint amid the rude jostle of our\nselfish existence.  The education of Christianity, it is true, the\nsympathy of a like experience and the example of women, may soften and,\npossibly, subvert this ugly characteristic of our sex; but it is\noriginally there, and has likewise its analogy in the practice of our\nbrute brethren, who hunt the sick or disabled member of the herd from\namong them, as an enemy.  It is for this reason that the stricken deer\ngoes apart, and the sick lion grimly withdraws himself into his den.\nExcept in love, or the attachments of kindred, or other very long and\nhabitual affection, we really have no tenderness.  But there was\nsomething of the woman moulded into the great, stalwart frame of\nHollingsworth; nor was he ashamed of it, as men often are of what is\nbest in them, nor seemed ever to know that there was such a soft place\nin his heart.  I knew it well, however, at that time, although\nafterwards it came nigh to be forgotten.  Methought there could not be\ntwo such men alive as Hollingsworth.  There never was any blaze of a\nfireside that warmed and cheered me, in the down-sinkings and\nshiverings of my spirit, so effectually as did the light out of those\neyes, which lay so deep and dark under his shaggy brows.\n\nHappy the man that has such a friend beside him when he comes to die!\nand unless a friend like Hollingsworth be at hand,--as most probably\nthere will not,--he had better make up his mind to die alone.  How many\nmen, I wonder, does one meet with in a lifetime, whom he would choose\nfor his deathbed companions!  At the crisis of my fever I besought\nHollingsworth to let nobody else enter the room, but continually to\nmake me sensible of his own presence by a grasp of the hand, a word, a\nprayer, if he thought good to utter it; and that then he should be the\nwitness how courageously I would encounter the worst. It still\nimpresses me as almost a matter of regret that I did not die then, when\nI had tolerably made up my mind to it; for Hollingsworth would have\ngone with me to the hither verge of life, and have sent his friendly\nand hopeful accents far over on the other side, while I should be\ntreading the unknown path.  Now, were I to send for him, he would\nhardly come to my bedside, nor should I depart the easier for his\npresence.\n\n\"You are not going to die, this time,\" said he, gravely smiling. \"You\nknow nothing about sickness, and think your case a great deal more\ndesperate than it is.\"\n\n\"Death should take me while I am in the mood,\" replied I, with a little\nof my customary levity.\n\n\"Have you nothing to do in life,\" asked Hollingsworth, \"that you fancy\nyourself so ready to leave it?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" answered I; \"nothing that I know of, unless to make pretty\nverses, and play a part, with Zenobia and the rest of the amateurs, in\nour pastoral.  It seems but an unsubstantial sort of business, as\nviewed through a mist of fever.  But, dear Hollingsworth, your own\nvocation is evidently to be a priest, and to spend your days and nights\nin helping your fellow creatures to draw peaceful dying breaths.\"\n\n\"And by which of my qualities,\" inquired he, \"can you suppose me fitted\nfor this awful ministry?\"\n\n\"By your tenderness,\" I said.  \"It seems to me the reflection of God's\nown love.\"\n\n\"And you call me tender!\" repeated Hollingsworth thoughtfully.  \"I\nshould rather say that the most marked trait in my character is an\ninflexible severity of purpose.  Mortal man has no right to be so\ninflexible as it is my nature and necessity to be.\"\n\n\"I do not believe it,\" I replied.\n\nBut, in due time, I remembered what he said.\n\nProbably, as Hollingsworth suggested, my disorder was never so serious\nas, in my ignorance of such matters, I was inclined to consider it.\nAfter so much tragical preparation, it was positively rather mortifying\nto find myself on the mending hand.\n\nAll the other members of the Community showed me kindness, according to\nthe full measure of their capacity.  Zenobia brought me my gruel every\nday, made by her own hands (not very skilfully, if the truth must be\ntold), and, whenever I seemed inclined to converse, would sit by my\nbedside, and talk with so much vivacity as to add several gratuitous\nthrobs to my pulse.  Her poor little stories and tracts never half did\njustice to her intellect.  It was only the lack of a fitter avenue that\ndrove her to seek development in literature.  She was made (among a\nthousand other things that she might have been) for a stump oratress.\nI recognized no severe culture in Zenobia; her mind was full of weeds.\nIt startled me sometimes, in my state of moral as well as bodily\nfaint-heartedness, to observe the hardihood of her philosophy.  She\nmade no scruple of oversetting all human institutions, and scattering\nthem as with a breeze from her fan.  A female reformer, in her attacks\nupon society, has an instinctive sense of where the life lies, and is\ninclined to aim directly at that spot.  Especially the relation between\nthe sexes is naturally among the earliest to attract her notice.\n\nZenobia was truly a magnificent woman.  The homely simplicity of her\ndress could not conceal, nor scarcely diminish, the queenliness of her\npresence.  The image of her form and face should have been multiplied\nall over the earth.  It was wronging the rest of mankind to retain her\nas the spectacle of only a few.  The stage would have been her proper\nsphere.  She should have made it a point of duty, moreover, to sit\nendlessly to painters and sculptors, and preferably to the latter;\nbecause the cold decorum of the marble would consist with the utmost\nscantiness of drapery, so that the eye might chastely be gladdened with\nher material perfection in its entireness.  I know not well how to\nexpress that the native glow of coloring in her cheeks, and even the\nflesh-warmth over her round arms, and what was visible of her full\nbust,--in a word, her womanliness incarnated,--compelled me sometimes\nto close my eyes, as if it were not quite the privilege of modesty to\ngaze at her.  Illness and exhaustion, no doubt, had made me morbidly\nsensitive.\n\nI noticed--and wondered how Zenobia contrived it--that she had always a\nnew flower in her hair.  And still it was a hot-house flower,--an\noutlandish flower,--a flower of the tropics, such as appeared to have\nsprung passionately out of a soil the very weeds of which would be\nfervid and spicy.  Unlike as was the flower of each successive day to\nthe preceding one, it yet so assimilated its richness to the rich\nbeauty of the woman, that I thought it the only flower fit to be worn;\nso fit, indeed, that Nature had evidently created this floral gem, in a\nhappy exuberance, for the one purpose of worthily adorning Zenobia's\nhead.  It might be that my feverish fantasies clustered themselves\nabout this peculiarity, and caused it to look more gorgeous and\nwonderful than if beheld with temperate eyes.  In the height of my\nillness, as I well recollect, I went so far as to pronounce it\npreternatural.\n\n\"Zenobia is an enchantress!\" whispered I once to Hollingsworth.  \"She\nis a sister of the Veiled Lady.  That flower in her hair is a talisman.\nIf you were to snatch it away, she would vanish, or be transformed into\nsomething else.\"\n\n\"What does he say?\" asked Zenobia.\n\n\"Nothing that has an atom of sense in it,\" answered Hollingsworth. \"He\nis a little beside himself, I believe, and talks about your being a\nwitch, and of some magical property in the flower that you wear in your\nhair.\"\n\n\"It is an idea worthy of a feverish poet,\" said she, laughing rather\ncompassionately, and taking out the flower.  \"I scorn to owe anything\nto magic.  Here, Mr. Hollingsworth, you may keep the spell while it has\nany virtue in it; but I cannot promise you not to appear with a new one\nto-morrow.  It is the one relic of my more brilliant, my happier days!\"\n\nThe most curious part of the matter was that, long after my slight\ndelirium had passed away,--as long, indeed, as I continued to know this\nremarkable woman,--her daily flower affected my imagination, though\nmore slightly, yet in very much the same way.  The reason must have\nbeen that, whether intentionally on her part or not, this favorite\nornament was actually a subtile expression of Zenobia's character.\n\nOne subject, about which--very impertinently, moreover--I perplexed\nmyself with a great many conjectures, was, whether Zenobia had ever\nbeen married.  The idea, it must be understood, was unauthorized by any\ncircumstance or suggestion that had made its way to my ears.  So young\nas I beheld her, and the freshest and rosiest woman of a thousand,\nthere was certainly no need of imputing to her a destiny already\naccomplished; the probability was far greater that her coming years had\nall life's richest gifts to bring.  If the great event of a woman's\nexistence had been consummated, the world knew nothing of it, although\nthe world seemed to know Zenobia well.  It was a ridiculous piece of\nromance, undoubtedly, to imagine that this beautiful personage, wealthy\nas she was, and holding a position that might fairly enough be called\ndistinguished, could have given herself away so privately, but that\nsome whisper and suspicion, and by degrees a full understanding of the\nfact, would eventually be blown abroad. But then, as I failed not to\nconsider, her original home was at a distance of many hundred miles.\nRumors might fill the social atmosphere, or might once have filled it,\nthere, which would travel but slowly, against the wind, towards our\nNortheastern metropolis, and perhaps melt into thin air before reaching\nit.\n\nThere was not--and I distinctly repeat it--the slightest foundation in\nmy knowledge for any surmise of the kind.  But there is a species of\nintuition,--either a spiritual lie or the subtile recognition of a\nfact,--which comes to us in a reduced state of the corporeal system.\nThe soul gets the better of the body, after wasting illness, or when a\nvegetable diet may have mingled too much ether in the blood. Vapors\nthen rise up to the brain, and take shapes that often image falsehood,\nbut sometimes truth.  The spheres of our companions have, at such\nperiods, a vastly greater influence upon our own than when robust\nhealth gives us a repellent and self-defensive energy. Zenobia's\nsphere, I imagine, impressed itself powerfully on mine, and transformed\nme, during this period of my weakness, into something like a mesmerical\nclairvoyant.\n\nThen, also, as anybody could observe, the freedom of her deportment\n(though, to some tastes, it might commend itself as the utmost\nperfection of manner in a youthful widow or a blooming matron) was not\nexactly maiden-like.  What girl had ever laughed as Zenobia did? What\ngirl had ever spoken in her mellow tones?  Her unconstrained and\ninevitable manifestation, I said often to myself, was that of a woman\nto whom wedlock had thrown wide the gates of mystery.  Yet sometimes I\nstrove to be ashamed of these conjectures.  I acknowledged it as a\nmasculine grossness--a sin of wicked interpretation, of which man is\noften guilty towards the other sex--thus to mistake the sweet, liberal,\nbut womanly frankness of a noble and generous disposition. Still, it\nwas of no avail to reason with myself nor to upbraid myself.\nPertinaciously the thought, \"Zenobia is a wife; Zenobia has lived and\nloved!  There is no folded petal, no latent dewdrop, in this perfectly\ndeveloped rose!\"--irresistibly that thought drove out all other\nconclusions, as often as my mind reverted to the subject.\n\nZenobia was conscious of my observation, though not, I presume, of the\npoint to which it led me.\n\n\"Mr. Coverdale,\" said she one day, as she saw me watching her, while\nshe arranged my gruel on the table, \"I have been exposed to a great\ndeal of eye-shot in the few years of my mixing in the world, but never,\nI think, to precisely such glances as you are in the habit of favoring\nme with.  I seem to interest you very much; and yet--or else a woman's\ninstinct is for once deceived--I cannot reckon you as an admirer.  What\nare you seeking to discover in me?\"\n\n\"The mystery of your life,\" answered I, surprised into the truth by the\nunexpectedness of her attack.  \"And you will never tell me.\"\n\nShe bent her head towards me, and let me look into her eyes, as if\nchallenging me to drop a plummet-line down into the depths of her\nconsciousness.\n\n\"I see nothing now,\" said I, closing my own eyes, \"unless it be the\nface of a sprite laughing at me from the bottom of a deep well.\"\n\nA bachelor always feels himself defrauded, when he knows or suspects\nthat any woman of his acquaintance has given herself away.  Otherwise,\nthe matter could have been no concern of mine.  It was purely\nspeculative, for I should not, under any circumstances, have fallen in\nlove with Zenobia.  The riddle made me so nervous, however, in my\nsensitive condition of mind and body, that I most ungratefully began to\nwish that she would let me alone.  Then, too, her gruel was very\nwretched stuff, with almost invariably the smell of pine smoke upon it,\nlike the evil taste that is said to mix itself up with a witch's best\nconcocted dainties.  Why could not she have allowed one of the other\nwomen to take the gruel in charge?  Whatever else might be her gifts,\nNature certainly never intended Zenobia for a cook.  Or, if so, she\nshould have meddled only with the richest and spiciest dishes, and such\nas are to be tasted at banquets, between draughts of intoxicating wine.\n\n\n\nVII. THE CONVALESCENT\n\nAs soon as my incommodities allowed me to think of past occurrences, I\nfailed not to inquire what had become of the odd little guest whom\nHollingsworth had been the medium of introducing among us.  It now\nappeared that poor Priscilla had not so literally fallen out of the\nclouds, as we were at first inclined to suppose.  A letter, which\nshould have introduced her, had since been received from one of the\ncity missionaries, containing a certificate of character and an\nallusion to circumstances which, in the writer's judgment, made it\nespecially desirable that she should find shelter in our Community.\nThere was a hint, not very intelligible, implying either that Priscilla\nhad recently escaped from some particular peril or irksomeness of\nposition, or else that she was still liable to this danger or\ndifficulty, whatever it might be.  We should ill have deserved the\nreputation of a benevolent fraternity, had we hesitated to entertain a\npetitioner in such need, and so strongly recommended to our kindness;\nnot to mention, moreover, that the strange maiden had set herself\ndiligently to work, and was doing good service with her needle.  But a\nslight mist of uncertainty still floated about Priscilla, and kept her,\nas yet, from taking a very decided place among creatures of flesh and\nblood.\n\nThe mysterious attraction, which, from her first entrance on our scene,\nshe evinced for Zenobia, had lost nothing of its force.  I often heard\nher footsteps, soft and low, accompanying the light but decided tread\nof the latter up the staircase, stealing along the passage-way by her\nnew friend's side, and pausing while Zenobia entered my chamber.\nOccasionally Zenobia would be a little annoyed by Priscilla's too close\nattendance.  In an authoritative and not very kindly tone, she would\nadvise her to breathe the pleasant air in a walk, or to go with her\nwork into the barn, holding out half a promise to come and sit on the\nhay with her, when at leisure. Evidently, Priscilla found but scanty\nrequital for her love. Hollingsworth was likewise a great favorite with\nher.  For several minutes together sometimes, while my auditory nerves\nretained the susceptibility of delicate health, I used to hear a low,\npleasant murmur ascending from the room below; and at last ascertained\nit to be Priscilla's voice, babbling like a little brook to\nHollingsworth. She talked more largely and freely with him than with\nZenobia, towards whom, indeed, her feelings seemed not so much to be\nconfidence as involuntary affection.  I should have thought all the\nbetter of my own qualities had Priscilla marked me out for the third\nplace in her regards.  But, though she appeared to like me tolerably\nwell, I could never flatter myself with being distinguished by her as\nHollingsworth and Zenobia were.\n\nOne forenoon, during my convalescence, there came a gentle tap at my\nchamber door.  I immediately said, \"Come in, Priscilla!\" with an acute\nsense of the applicant's identity.  Nor was I deceived.  It was really\nPriscilla,--a pale, large-eyed little woman (for she had gone far\nenough into her teens to be, at least, on the outer limit of girlhood),\nbut much less wan than at my previous view of her, and far better\nconditioned both as to health and spirits.  As I first saw her, she had\nreminded me of plants that one sometimes observes doing their best to\nvegetate among the bricks of an enclosed court, where there is scanty\nsoil and never any sunshine.  At present, though with no approach to\nbloom, there were indications that the girl had human blood in her\nveins.\n\nPriscilla came softly to my bedside, and held out an article of\nsnow-white linen, very carefully and smoothly ironed.  She did not seem\nbashful, nor anywise embarrassed.  My weakly condition, I suppose,\nsupplied a medium in which she could approach me.\n\n\"Do not you need this?\" asked she.  \"I have made it for you.\"  It was a\nnightcap!\n\n\"My dear Priscilla,\" said I, smiling, \"I never had on a nightcap in my\nlife!  But perhaps it will be better for me to wear one, now that I am\na miserable invalid.  How admirably you have done it!  No, no; I never\ncan think of wearing such an exquisitely wrought nightcap as this,\nunless it be in the daytime, when I sit up to receive company.\"\n\n\"It is for use, not beauty,\" answered Priscilla.  \"I could have\nembroidered it and made it much prettier, if I pleased.\"\n\nWhile holding up the nightcap and admiring the fine needlework, I\nperceived that Priscilla had a sealed letter which she was waiting for\nme to take.  It had arrived from the village post-office that morning.\nAs I did not immediately offer to receive the letter, she drew it back,\nand held it against her bosom, with both hands clasped over it, in a\nway that had probably grown habitual to her.  Now, on turning my eyes\nfrom the nightcap to Priscilla, it forcibly struck me that her air,\nthough not her figure, and the expression of her face, but not its\nfeatures, had a resemblance to what I had often seen in a friend of\nmine, one of the most gifted women of the age.  I cannot describe it.\nThe points easiest to convey to the reader were a certain curve of the\nshoulders and a partial closing of the eyes, which seemed to look more\npenetratingly into my own eyes, through the narrowed apertures, than if\nthey had been open at full width.  It was a singular anomaly of\nlikeness coexisting with perfect dissimilitude.\n\n\"Will you give me the letter, Priscilla?\" said I.\n\nShe started, put the letter into my hand, and quite lost the look that\nhad drawn my notice.\n\n\"Priscilla,\" I inquired, \"did you ever see Miss Margaret Fuller?\"\n\n\"No,\" she answered.\n\n\"Because,\" said I, \"you reminded me of her just now,--and it happens,\nstrangely enough, that this very letter is from her.\"\n\nPriscilla, for whatever reason, looked very much discomposed.\n\n\"I wish people would not fancy such odd things in me!\" she said rather\npetulantly.  \"How could I possibly make myself resemble this lady\nmerely by holding her letter in my hand?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Priscilla, it would puzzle me to explain it,\" I replied;\n\"nor do I suppose that the letter had anything to do with it.  It was\njust a coincidence, nothing more.\"\n\nShe hastened out of the room, and this was the last that I saw of\nPriscilla until I ceased to be an invalid.\n\nBeing much alone during my recovery, I read interminably in Mr.\nEmerson's Essays, \"The Dial,\" Carlyle's works, George Sand's romances\n(lent me by Zenobia), and other books which one or another of the\nbrethren or sisterhood had brought with them.  Agreeing in little else,\nmost of these utterances were like the cry of some solitary sentinel,\nwhose station was on the outposts of the advance guard of human\nprogression; or sometimes the voice came sadly from among the shattered\nruins of the past, but yet had a hopeful echo in the future. They were\nwell adapted (better, at least, than any other intellectual products,\nthe volatile essence of which had heretofore tinctured a printed page)\nto pilgrims like ourselves, whose present bivouac was considerably\nfurther into the waste of chaos than any mortal army of crusaders had\never marched before.  Fourier's works, also, in a series of horribly\ntedious volumes, attracted a good deal of my attention, from the\nanalogy which I could not but recognize between his system and our own.\nThere was far less resemblance, it is true, than the world chose to\nimagine, inasmuch as the two theories differed, as widely as the zenith\nfrom the nadir, in their main principles.\n\nI talked about Fourier to Hollingsworth, and translated, for his\nbenefit, some of the passages that chiefly impressed me.\n\n\"When, as a consequence of human improvement,\" said I, \"the globe shall\narrive at its final perfection, the great ocean is to be converted into\na particular kind of lemonade, such as was fashionable at Paris in\nFourier's time.  He calls it limonade a cedre.  It is positively a\nfact!  Just imagine the city docks filled, every day, with a flood tide\nof this delectable beverage!\"\n\n\"Why did not the Frenchman make punch of it at once?\" asked\nHollingsworth.  \"The jack-tars would be delighted to go down in ships\nand do business in such an element.\"\n\nI further proceeded to explain, as well as I modestly could, several\npoints of Fourier's system, illustrating them with here and there a\npage or two, and asking Hollingsworth's opinion as to the expediency of\nintroducing these beautiful peculiarities into our own practice.\n\n\"Let me hear no more of it!\" cried he, in utter disgust.  \"I never will\nforgive this fellow!  He has committed the unpardonable sin; for what\nmore monstrous iniquity could the Devil himself contrive than to choose\nthe selfish principle,--the principle of all human wrong, the very\nblackness of man's heart, the portion of ourselves which we shudder at,\nand which it is the whole aim of spiritual discipline to eradicate,--to\nchoose it as the master workman of his system?  To seize upon and\nfoster whatever vile, petty, sordid, filthy, bestial, and abominable\ncorruptions have cankered into our nature, to be the efficient\ninstruments of his infernal regeneration!  And his consummated\nParadise, as he pictures it, would be worthy of the agency which he\ncounts upon for establishing it.  The nauseous villain!\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" remarked I, \"in consideration of the promised delights\nof his system,--so very proper, as they certainly are, to be\nappreciated by Fourier's countrymen,--I cannot but wonder that\nuniversal France did not adopt his theory at a moment's warning.  But\nis there not something very characteristic of his nation in Fourier's\nmanner of putting forth his views?  He makes no claim to inspiration.\nHe has not persuaded himself--as Swedenborg did, and as any other than\na Frenchman would, with a mission of like importance to\ncommunicate--that he speaks with authority from above.  He promulgates\nhis system, so far as I can perceive, entirely on his own\nresponsibility.  He has searched out and discovered the whole counsel\nof the Almighty in respect to mankind, past, present, and for exactly\nseventy thousand years to come, by the mere force and cunning of his\nindividual intellect!\"\n\n\"Take the book out of my sight,\" said Hollingsworth with great\nvirulence of expression, \"or, I tell you fairly, I shall fling it in\nthe fire!  And as for Fourier, let him make a Paradise, if he can, of\nGehenna, where, as I conscientiously believe, he is floundering at this\nmoment!\"\n\n\"And bellowing, I suppose,\" said I,--not that I felt any ill-will\ntowards Fourier, but merely wanted to give the finishing touch to\nHollingsworth's image, \"bellowing for the least drop of his beloved\nlimonade a cedre!\"\n\nThere is but little profit to be expected in attempting to argue with a\nman who allows himself to declaim in this manner; so I dropt the\nsubject, and never took it up again.\n\nBut had the system at which he was so enraged combined almost any\namount of human wisdom, spiritual insight, and imaginative beauty, I\nquestion whether Hollingsworth's mind was in a fit condition to receive\nit.  I began to discern that he had come among us actuated by no real\nsympathy with our feelings and our hopes, but chiefly because we were\nestranging ourselves from the world, with which his lonely and\nexclusive object in life had already put him at odds. Hollingsworth\nmust have been originally endowed with a great spirit of benevolence,\ndeep enough and warm enough to be the source of as much disinterested\ngood as Providence often allows a human being the privilege of\nconferring upon his fellows.  This native instinct yet lived within\nhim.  I myself had profited by it, in my necessity.  It was seen, too,\nin his treatment of Priscilla.  Such casual circumstances as were here\ninvolved would quicken his divine power of sympathy, and make him seem,\nwhile their influence lasted, the tenderest man and the truest friend\non earth.  But by and by you missed the tenderness of yesterday, and\ngrew drearily conscious that Hollingsworth had a closer friend than\never you could be; and this friend was the cold, spectral monster which\nhe had himself conjured up, and on which he was wasting all the warmth\nof his heart, and of which, at last,--as these men of a mighty purpose\nso invariably do,--he had grown to be the bond-slave.  It was his\nphilanthropic theory.\n\nThis was a result exceedingly sad to contemplate, considering that it\nhad been mainly brought about by the very ardor and exuberance of his\nphilanthropy.  Sad, indeed, but by no means unusual: he had taught his\nbenevolence to pour its warm tide exclusively through one channel; so\nthat there was nothing to spare for other great manifestations of love\nto man, nor scarcely for the nutriment of individual attachments,\nunless they could minister in some way to the terrible egotism which he\nmistook for an angel of God.  Had Hollingsworth's education been more\nenlarged, he might not so inevitably have stumbled into this pitfall.\nBut this identical pursuit had educated him.  He knew absolutely\nnothing, except in a single direction, where he had thought so\nenergetically, and felt to such a depth, that no doubt the entire\nreason and justice of the universe appeared to be concentrated\nthitherward.\n\nIt is my private opinion that, at this period of his life,\nHollingsworth was fast going mad; and, as with other crazy people\n(among whom I include humorists of every degree), it required all the\nconstancy of friendship to restrain his associates from pronouncing him\nan intolerable bore.  Such prolonged fiddling upon one string--such\nmultiform presentation of one idea!  His specific object (of which he\nmade the public more than sufficiently aware, through the medium of\nlectures and pamphlets) was to obtain funds for the construction of an\nedifice, with a sort of collegiate endowment.  On this foundation he\npurposed to devote himself and a few disciples to the reform and mental\nculture of our criminal brethren.  His visionary edifice was\nHollingsworth's one castle in the air; it was the material type in\nwhich his philanthropic dream strove to embody itself; and he made the\nscheme more definite, and caught hold of it the more strongly, and kept\nhis clutch the more pertinaciously, by rendering it visible to the\nbodily eye.  I have seen him, a hundred times, with a pencil and sheet\nof paper, sketching the facade, the side-view, or the rear of the\nstructure, or planning the internal arrangements, as lovingly as\nanother man might plan those of the projected home where he meant to be\nhappy with his wife and children. I have known him to begin a model of\nthe building with little stones, gathered at the brookside, whither we\nhad gone to cool ourselves in the sultry noon of haying-time.  Unlike\nall other ghosts, his spirit haunted an edifice, which, instead of\nbeing time-worn, and full of storied love, and joy, and sorrow, had\nnever yet come into existence.\n\n\"Dear friend,\" said I once to Hollingsworth, before leaving my\nsick-chamber, \"I heartily wish that I could make your schemes my\nschemes, because it would be so great a happiness to find myself\ntreading the same path with you.  But I am afraid there is not stuff in\nme stern enough for a philanthropist,--or not in this peculiar\ndirection,--or, at all events, not solely in this.  Can you bear with\nme, if such should prove to be the case?\"\n\n\"I will at least wait awhile,\" answered Hollingsworth, gazing at me\nsternly and gloomily.  \"But how can you be my life-long friend, except\nyou strive with me towards the great object of my life?\"\n\nHeaven forgive me!  A horrible suspicion crept into my heart, and stung\nthe very core of it as with the fangs of an adder.  I wondered whether\nit were possible that Hollingsworth could have watched by my bedside,\nwith all that devoted care, only for the ulterior purpose of making me\na proselyte to his views!\n\n\n\nVIII. A MODERN ARCADIA\n\nMay-day--I forget whether by Zenobia's sole decree, or by the unanimous\nvote of our community--had been declared a movable festival. It was\ndeferred until the sun should have had a reasonable time to clear away\nthe snowdrifts along the lee of the stone walls, and bring out a few of\nthe readiest wild flowers.  On the forenoon of the substituted day,\nafter admitting some of the balmy air into my chamber, I decided that\nit was nonsense and effeminacy to keep myself a prisoner any longer.\nSo I descended to the sitting-room, and finding nobody there, proceeded\nto the barn, whence I had already heard Zenobia's voice, and along with\nit a girlish laugh which was not so certainly recognizable.  Arriving\nat the spot, it a little surprised me to discover that these merry\noutbreaks came from Priscilla.\n\nThe two had been a-maying together.  They had found anemones in\nabundance, houstonias by the handful, some columbines, a few\nlong-stalked violets, and a quantity of white everlasting flowers, and\nhad filled up their basket with the delicate spray of shrubs and trees.\nNone were prettier than the maple twigs, the leaf of which looks like a\nscarlet bud in May, and like a plate of vegetable gold in October.\nZenobia, who showed no conscience in such matters, had also rifled a\ncherry-tree of one of its blossomed boughs, and, with all this variety\nof sylvan ornament, had been decking out Priscilla. Being done with a\ngood deal of taste, it made her look more charming than I should have\nthought possible, with my recollection of the wan, frost-nipt girl, as\nheretofore described.  Nevertheless, among those fragrant blossoms, and\nconspicuously, too, had been stuck a weed of evil odor and ugly aspect,\nwhich, as soon as I detected it, destroyed the effect of all the rest.\nThere was a gleam of latent mischief--not to call it deviltry--in\nZenobia's eye, which seemed to indicate a slightly malicious purpose in\nthe arrangement.\n\nAs for herself, she scorned the rural buds and leaflets, and wore\nnothing but her invariable flower of the tropics.\n\n\"What do you think of Priscilla now, Mr. Coverdale?\" asked she,\nsurveying her as a child does its doll.  \"Is not she worth a verse or\ntwo?\"\n\n\"There is only one thing amiss,\" answered I. Zenobia laughed, and flung\nthe malignant weed away.\n\n\"Yes; she deserves some verses now,\" said I, \"and from a better poet\nthan myself.  She is the very picture of the New England spring;\nsubdued in tint and rather cool, but with a capacity of sunshine, and\nbringing us a few Alpine blossoms, as earnest of something richer,\nthough hardly more beautiful, hereafter.  The best type of her is one\nof those anemones.\"\n\n\"What I find most singular in Priscilla, as her health improves,\"\nobserved Zenobia, \"is her wildness.  Such a quiet little body as she\nseemed, one would not have expected that.  Why, as we strolled the\nwoods together, I could hardly keep her from scrambling up the trees,\nlike a squirrel.  She has never before known what it is to live in the\nfree air, and so it intoxicates her as if she were sipping wine. And\nshe thinks it such a paradise here, and all of us, particularly Mr.\nHollingsworth and myself, such angels!  It is quite ridiculous, and\nprovokes one's malice almost, to see a creature so happy, especially a\nfeminine creature.\"\n\n\"They are always happier than male creatures,\" said I.\n\n\"You must correct that opinion, Mr. Coverdale,\" replied Zenobia\ncontemptuously, \"or I shall think you lack the poetic insight.  Did you\never see a happy woman in your life?  Of course, I do not mean a girl,\nlike Priscilla and a thousand others,--for they are all alike, while on\nthe sunny side of experience,--but a grown woman.  How can she be\nhappy, after discovering that fate has assigned her but one single\nevent, which she must contrive to make the substance of her whole life?\nA man has his choice of innumerable events.\"\n\n\"A woman, I suppose,\" answered I, \"by constant repetition of her one\nevent, may compensate for the lack of variety.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Zenobia.\n\nWhile we were talking, Priscilla caught sight of Hollingsworth at a\ndistance, in a blue frock, and with a hoe over his shoulder, returning\nfrom the field.  She immediately set out to meet him, running and\nskipping, with spirits as light as the breeze of the May morning, but\nwith limbs too little exercised to be quite responsive; she clapped her\nhands, too, with great exuberance of gesture, as is the custom of young\ngirls when their electricity overcharges them. But, all at once, midway\nto Hollingsworth, she paused, looked round about her, towards the\nriver, the road, the woods, and back towards us, appearing to listen,\nas if she heard some one calling her name, and knew not precisely in\nwhat direction.\n\n\"Have you bewitched her?\"  I exclaimed.\n\n\"It is no sorcery of mine,\" said Zenobia; \"but I have seen the girl do\nthat identical thing once or twice before.  Can you imagine what is the\nmatter with her?\"\n\n\"No; unless,\" said I, \"she has the gift of hearing those 'airy tongues\nthat syllable men's names,' which Milton tells about.\"\n\nFrom whatever cause, Priscilla's animation seemed entirely to have\ndeserted her.  She seated herself on a rock, and remained there until\nHollingsworth came up; and when he took her hand and led her back to\nus, she rather resembled my original image of the wan and spiritless\nPriscilla than the flowery May-queen of a few moments ago.  These\nsudden transformations, only to be accounted for by an extreme nervous\nsusceptibility, always continued to characterize the girl, though with\ndiminished frequency as her health progressively grew more robust.\n\nI was now on my legs again.  My fit of illness had been an avenue\nbetween two existences; the low-arched and darksome doorway, through\nwhich I crept out of a life of old conventionalisms, on my hands and\nknees, as it were, and gained admittance into the freer region that lay\nbeyond.  In this respect, it was like death.  And, as with death, too,\nit was good to have gone through it.  No otherwise could I have rid\nmyself of a thousand follies, fripperies, prejudices, habits, and other\nsuch worldly dust as inevitably settles upon the crowd along the broad\nhighway, giving them all one sordid aspect before noon-time, however\nfreshly they may have begun their pilgrimage in the dewy morning.  The\nvery substance upon my bones had not been fit to live with in any\nbetter, truer, or more energetic mode than that to which I was\naccustomed.  So it was taken off me and flung aside, like any other\nworn-out or unseasonable garment; and, after shivering a little while\nin my skeleton, I began to be clothed anew, and much more\nsatisfactorily than in my previous suit.  In literal and physical\ntruth, I was quite another man.  I had a lively sense of the exultation\nwith which the spirit will enter on the next stage of its eternal\nprogress after leaving the heavy burden of its mortality in an early\ngrave, with as little concern for what may become of it as now affected\nme for the flesh which I had lost.\n\nEmerging into the genial sunshine, I half fancied that the labors of\nthe brotherhood had already realized some of Fourier's predictions.\nTheir enlightened culture of the soil, and the virtues with which they\nsanctified their life, had begun to produce an effect upon the material\nworld and its climate.  In my new enthusiasm, man looked strong and\nstately,--and woman, oh, how beautiful!--and the earth a green garden,\nblossoming with many-colored delights.  Thus Nature, whose laws I had\nbroken in various artificial ways, comported herself towards me as a\nstrict but loving mother, who uses the rod upon her little boy for his\nnaughtiness, and then gives him a smile, a kiss, and some pretty\nplaythings to console the urchin for her severity.\n\nIn the interval of my seclusion, there had been a number of recruits to\nour little army of saints and martyrs.  They were mostly individuals\nwho had gone through such an experience as to disgust them with\nordinary pursuits, but who were not yet so old, nor had suffered so\ndeeply, as to lose their faith in the better time to come. On comparing\ntheir minds one with another they often discovered that this idea of a\nCommunity had been growing up, in silent and unknown sympathy, for\nyears.  Thoughtful, strongly lined faces were among them; sombre brows,\nbut eyes that did not require spectacles, unless prematurely dimmed by\nthe student's lamplight, and hair that seldom showed a thread of\nsilver.  Age, wedded to the past, incrusted over with a stony layer of\nhabits, and retaining nothing fluid in its possibilities, would have\nbeen absurdly out of place in an enterprise like this.  Youth, too, in\nits early dawn, was hardly more adapted to our purpose; for it would\nbehold the morning radiance of its own spirit beaming over the very\nsame spots of withered grass and barren sand whence most of us had seen\nit vanish.  We had very young people with us, it is true,--downy lads,\nrosy girls in their first teens, and children of all heights above\none's knee; but these had chiefly been sent hither for education, which\nit was one of the objects and methods of our institution to supply.\nThen we had boarders, from town and elsewhere, who lived with us in a\nfamiliar way, sympathized more or less in our theories, and sometimes\nshared in our labors.\n\nOn the whole, it was a society such as has seldom met together; nor,\nperhaps, could it reasonably be expected to hold together long. Persons\nof marked individuality--crooked sticks, as some of us might be\ncalled--are not exactly the easiest to bind up into a fagot.  But, so\nlong as our union should subsist, a man of intellect and feeling, with\na free nature in him, might have sought far and near without finding so\nmany points of attraction as would allure him hitherward. We were of\nall creeds and opinions, and generally tolerant of all, on every\nimaginable subject.  Our bond, it seems to me, was not affirmative, but\nnegative.  We had individually found one thing or another to quarrel\nwith in our past life, and were pretty well agreed as to the\ninexpediency of lumbering along with the old system any further.  As to\nwhat should be substituted, there was much less unanimity.  We did not\ngreatly care--at least, I never did--for the written constitution under\nwhich our millennium had commenced.  My hope was, that, between theory\nand practice, a true and available mode of life might be struck out;\nand that, even should we ultimately fail, the months or years spent in\nthe trial would not have been wasted, either as regarded passing\nenjoyment, or the experience which makes men wise.\n\nArcadians though we were, our costume bore no resemblance to the\nberibboned doublets, silk breeches and stockings, and slippers fastened\nwith artificial roses, that distinguish the pastoral people of poetry\nand the stage.  In outward show, I humbly conceive, we looked rather\nlike a gang of beggars, or banditti, than either a company of honest\nlaboring-men, or a conclave of philosophers. Whatever might be our\npoints of difference, we all of us seemed to have come to Blithedale\nwith the one thrifty and laudable idea of wearing out our old clothes.\nSuch garments as had an airing, whenever we strode afield!  Coats with\nhigh collars and with no collars, broad-skirted or swallow-tailed, and\nwith the waist at every point between the hip and arm-pit; pantaloons\nof a dozen successive epochs, and greatly defaced at the knees by the\nhumiliations of the wearer before his lady-love,--in short, we were a\nliving epitome of defunct fashions, and the very raggedest presentment\nof men who had seen better days.  It was gentility in tatters.  Often\nretaining a scholarlike or clerical air, you might have taken us for\nthe denizens of Grub Street, intent on getting a comfortable livelihood\nby agricultural labor; or Coleridge's projected Pantisocracy in full\nexperiment; or Candide and his motley associates at work in their\ncabbage garden; or anything else that was miserably out at elbows, and\nmost clumsily patched in the rear.  We might have been sworn comrades\nto Falstaff's ragged regiment.  Little skill as we boasted in other\npoints of husbandry, every mother's son of us would have served\nadmirably to stick up for a scarecrow.  And the worst of the matter\nwas, that the first energetic movement essential to one downright\nstroke of real labor was sure to put a finish to these poor\nhabiliments.  So we gradually flung them all aside, and took to honest\nhomespun and linsey-woolsey, as preferable, on the whole, to the plan\nrecommended, I think, by Virgil,--\"Ara nudus; sere nudus, \"--which as\nSilas Foster remarked, when I translated the maxim, would be apt to\nastonish the women-folks.\n\nAfter a reasonable training, the yeoman life throve well with us. Our\nfaces took the sunburn kindly; our chests gained in compass, and our\nshoulders in breadth and squareness; our great brown fists looked as if\nthey had never been capable of kid gloves.  The plough, the hoe, the\nscythe, and the hay-fork grew familiar to our grasp.  The oxen\nresponded to our voices.  We could do almost as fair a day's work as\nSilas Foster himself, sleep dreamlessly after it, and awake at daybreak\nwith only a little stiffness of the joints, which was usually quite\ngone by breakfast-time.\n\nTo be sure, our next neighbors pretended to be incredulous as to our\nreal proficiency in the business which we had taken in hand.  They told\nslanderous fables about our inability to yoke our own oxen, or to drive\nthem afield when yoked, or to release the poor brutes from their\nconjugal bond at nightfall.  They had the face to say, too, that the\ncows laughed at our awkwardness at milking-time, and invariably kicked\nover the pails; partly in consequence of our putting the stool on the\nwrong side, and partly because, taking offence at the whisking of their\ntails, we were in the habit of holding these natural fly-flappers with\none hand and milking with the other.  They further averred that we hoed\nup whole acres of Indian corn and other crops, and drew the earth\ncarefully about the weeds; and that we raised five hundred tufts of\nburdock, mistaking them for cabbages; and that by dint of unskilful\nplanting few of our seeds ever came up at all, or, if they did come up,\nit was stern-foremost; and that we spent the better part of the month\nof June in reversing a field of beans, which had thrust themselves out\nof the ground in this unseemly way.  They quoted it as nothing more\nthan an ordinary occurrence for one or other of us to crop off two or\nthree fingers, of a morning, by our clumsy use of the hay-cutter.\nFinally, and as an ultimate catastrophe, these mendacious rogues\ncirculated a report that we communitarians were exterminated, to the\nlast man, by severing ourselves asunder with the sweep of our own\nscythes! and that the world had lost nothing by this little accident.\n\nBut this was pure envy and malice on the part of the neighboring\nfarmers.  The peril of our new way of life was not lest we should fail\nin becoming practical agriculturists, but that we should probably cease\nto be anything else.  While our enterprise lay all in theory, we had\npleased ourselves with delectable visions of the spiritualization of\nlabor.  It was to be our form of prayer and ceremonial of worship.\nEach stroke of the hoe was to uncover some aromatic root of wisdom,\nheretofore hidden from the sun.  Pausing in the field, to let the wind\nexhale the moisture from our foreheads, we were to look upward, and\ncatch glimpses into the far-off soul of truth.  In this point of view,\nmatters did not turn out quite so well as we anticipated.  It is very\ntrue that, sometimes, gazing casually around me, out of the midst of my\ntoil, I used to discern a richer picturesqueness in the visible scene\nof earth and sky.  There was, at such moments, a novelty, an unwonted\naspect, on the face of Nature, as if she had been taken by surprise and\nseen at unawares, with no opportunity to put off her real look, and\nassume the mask with which she mysteriously hides herself from mortals.\nBut this was all.  The clods of earth, which we so constantly belabored\nand turned over and over, were never etherealized into thought.  Our\nthoughts, on the contrary, were fast becoming cloddish.  Our labor\nsymbolized nothing, and left us mentally sluggish in the dusk of the\nevening. Intellectual activity is incompatible with any large amount of\nbodily exercise.  The yeoman and the scholar--the yeoman and the man of\nfinest moral culture, though not the man of sturdiest sense and\nintegrity--are two distinct individuals, and can never be melted or\nwelded into one substance.\n\nZenobia soon saw this truth, and gibed me about it, one evening, as\nHollingsworth and I lay on the grass, after a hard day's work.\n\n\"I am afraid you did not make a song today, while loading the\nhay-cart,\" said she, \"as Burns did, when he was reaping barley.\"\n\n\"Burns never made a song in haying-time,\" I answered very positively.\n\"He was no poet while a farmer, and no farmer while a poet.\"\n\n\"And on the whole, which of the two characters do you like best?\" asked\nZenobia.  \"For I have an idea that you cannot combine them any better\nthan Burns did.  Ah, I see, in my mind's eye, what sort of an\nindividual you are to be, two or three years hence.  Grim Silas Foster\nis your prototype, with his palm of sole-leather, and his joints of\nrusty iron (which all through summer keep the stiffness of what he\ncalls his winter's rheumatize), and his brain of--I don't know what his\nbrain is made of, unless it be a Savoy cabbage; but yours may be\ncauliflower, as a rather more delicate variety.  Your physical man will\nbe transmuted into salt beef and fried pork, at the rate, I should\nimagine, of a pound and a half a day; that being about the average\nwhich we find necessary in the kitchen.  You will make your toilet for\nthe day (still like this delightful Silas Foster) by rinsing your\nfingers and the front part of your face in a little tin pan of water at\nthe doorstep, and teasing your hair with a wooden pocket-comb before a\nseven-by-nine-inch looking-glass.  Your only pastime will be to smoke\nsome very vile tobacco in the black stump of a pipe.\"\n\n\"Pray, spare me!\" cried I. \"But the pipe is not Silas's only mode of\nsolacing himself with the weed.\"\n\n\"Your literature,\" continued Zenobia, apparently delighted with her\ndescription, \"will be the 'Farmer's Almanac;' for I observe our friend\nFoster never gets so far as the newspaper.  When you happen to sit\ndown, at odd moments, you will fall asleep, and make nasal proclamation\nof the fact, as he does; and invariably you must be jogged out of a\nnap, after supper, by the future Mrs. Coverdale, and persuaded to go\nregularly to bed.  And on Sundays, when you put on a blue coat with\nbrass buttons, you will think of nothing else to do but to go and\nlounge over the stone walls and rail fences, and stare at the corn\ngrowing.  And you will look with a knowing eye at oxen, and will have a\ntendency to clamber over into pigsties, and feel of the hogs, and give\na guess how much they will weigh after you shall have stuck and dressed\nthem.  Already I have noticed you begin to speak through your nose, and\nwith a drawl.  Pray, if you really did make any poetry to-day, let us\nhear it in that kind of utterance!\"\n\n\"Coverdale has given up making verses now,\" said Hollingsworth, who\nnever had the slightest appreciation of my poetry.  \"Just think of him\npenning a sonnet with a fist like that!  There is at least this good in\na life of toil, that it takes the nonsense and fancy-work out of a man,\nand leaves nothing but what truly belongs to him.  If a farmer can make\npoetry at the plough-tail, it must be because his nature insists on it;\nand if that be the case, let him make it, in Heaven's name!\"\n\n\"And how is it with you?\" asked Zenobia, in a different voice; for she\nnever laughed at Hollingsworth, as she often did at me.  \"You, I think,\ncannot have ceased to live a life of thought and feeling.\"\n\n\"I have always been in earnest,\" answered Hollingsworth.  \"I have\nhammered thought out of iron, after heating the iron in my heart!  It\nmatters little what my outward toil may be.  Were I a slave, at the\nbottom of a mine, I should keep the same purpose, the same faith in its\nultimate accomplishment, that I do now.  Miles Coverdale is not in\nearnest, either as a poet or a laborer.\"\n\n\"You give me hard measure, Hollingsworth,\" said I, a little hurt.  \"I\nhave kept pace with you in the field; and my bones feel as if I had\nbeen in earnest, whatever may be the case with my brain!\"\n\n\"I cannot conceive,\" observed Zenobia with great emphasis,--and, no\ndoubt, she spoke fairly the feeling of the moment,--\"I cannot conceive\nof being so continually as Mr. Coverdale is within the sphere of a\nstrong and noble nature, without being strengthened and ennobled by its\ninfluence!\"\n\nThis amiable remark of the fair Zenobia confirmed me in what I had\nalready begun to suspect, that Hollingsworth, like many other\nillustrious prophets, reformers, and philanthropists, was likely to\nmake at least two proselytes among the women to one among the men.\nZenobia and Priscilla!  These, I believe (unless my unworthy self might\nbe reckoned for a third), were the only disciples of his mission; and I\nspent a great deal of time, uselessly, in trying to conjecture what\nHollingsworth meant to do with them--and they with him!\n\n\n\nIX. HOLLINGSWORTH, ZENOBIA, PRISCILLA\n\nIt is not, I apprehend, a healthy kind of mental occupation to devote\nourselves too exclusively to the study of individual men and women. If\nthe person under examination be one's self, the result is pretty\ncertain to be diseased action of the heart, almost before we can snatch\na second glance.  Or if we take the freedom to put a friend under our\nmicroscope, we thereby insulate him from many of his true relations,\nmagnify his peculiarities, inevitably tear him into parts, and of\ncourse patch him very clumsily together again.  What wonder, then,\nshould we be frightened by the aspect of a monster, which, after\nall,--though we can point to every feature of his deformity in the real\npersonage,--may be said to have been created mainly by ourselves.\n\nThus, as my conscience has often whispered me, I did Hollingsworth a\ngreat wrong by prying into his character; and am perhaps doing him as\ngreat a one, at this moment, by putting faith in the discoveries which\nI seemed to make.  But I could not help it.  Had I loved him less, I\nmight have used him better.  He and Zenobia and Priscilla--both for\ntheir own sakes and as connected with him--were separated from the rest\nof the Community, to my imagination, and stood forth as the indices of\na problem which it was my business to solve.  Other associates had a\nportion of my time; other matters amused me; passing occurrences\ncarried me along with them, while they lasted.  But here was the vortex\nof my meditations, around which they revolved, and whitherward they too\ncontinually tended.  In the midst of cheerful society, I had often a\nfeeling of loneliness.  For it was impossible not to be sensible that,\nwhile these three characters figured so largely on my private theatre,\nI--though probably reckoned as a friend by all--was at best but a\nsecondary or tertiary personage with either of them.\n\nI loved Hollingsworth, as has already been enough expressed.  But it\nimpressed me, more and more, that there was a stern and dreadful\npeculiarity in this man, such as could not prove otherwise than\npernicious to the happiness of those who should be drawn into too\nintimate a connection with him.  He was not altogether human.  There\nwas something else in Hollingsworth besides flesh and blood, and\nsympathies and affections and celestial spirit.\n\nThis is always true of those men who have surrendered themselves to an\noverruling purpose.  It does not so much impel them from without, nor\neven operate as a motive power within, but grows incorporate with all\nthat they think and feel, and finally converts them into little else\nsave that one principle.  When such begins to be the predicament, it is\nnot cowardice, but wisdom, to avoid these victims.  They have no heart,\nno sympathy, no reason, no conscience.  They will keep no friend,\nunless he make himself the mirror of their purpose; they will smite and\nslay you, and trample your dead corpse under foot, all the more\nreadily, if you take the first step with them, and cannot take the\nsecond, and the third, and every other step of their terribly strait\npath.  They have an idol to which they consecrate themselves\nhigh-priest, and deem it holy work to offer sacrifices of whatever is\nmost precious; and never once seem to suspect--so cunning has the Devil\nbeen with them--that this false deity, in whose iron features,\nimmitigable to all the rest of mankind, they see only benignity and\nlove, is but a spectrum of the very priest himself, projected upon the\nsurrounding darkness.  And the higher and purer the original object,\nand the more unselfishly it may have been taken up, the slighter is the\nprobability that they can be led to recognize the process by which\ngodlike benevolence has been debased into all-devouring egotism.\n\nOf course I am perfectly aware that the above statement is exaggerated,\nin the attempt to make it adequate.  Professed philanthropists have\ngone far; but no originally good man, I presume, ever went quite so far\nas this.  Let the reader abate whatever he deems fit.  The paragraph\nmay remain, however, both for its truth and its exaggeration, as\nstrongly expressive of the tendencies which were really operative in\nHollingsworth, and as exemplifying the kind of error into which my mode\nof observation was calculated to lead me. The issue was, that in\nsolitude I often shuddered at my friend.  In my recollection of his\ndark and impressive countenance, the features grew more sternly\nprominent than the reality, duskier in their depth and shadow, and more\nlurid in their light; the frown, that had merely flitted across his\nbrow, seemed to have contorted it with an adamantine wrinkle.  On\nmeeting him again, I was often filled with remorse, when his deep eyes\nbeamed kindly upon me, as with the glow of a household fire that was\nburning in a cave.  \"He is a man after all,\" thought I; \"his Maker's\nown truest image, a philanthropic man!--not that steel engine of the\nDevil's contrivance, a philanthropist!\" But in my wood-walks, and in my\nsilent chamber, the dark face frowned at me again.\n\nWhen a young girl comes within the sphere of such a man, she is as\nperilously situated as the maiden whom, in the old classical myths, the\npeople used to expose to a dragon.  If I had any duty whatever, in\nreference to Hollingsworth, it was to endeavor to save Priscilla from\nthat kind of personal worship which her sex is generally prone to\nlavish upon saints and heroes.  It often requires but one smile out of\nthe hero's eyes into the girl's or woman's heart, to transform this\ndevotion, from a sentiment of the highest approval and confidence, into\npassionate love.  Now, Hollingsworth smiled much upon Priscilla,--more\nthan upon any other person.  If she thought him beautiful, it was no\nwonder.  I often thought him so, with the expression of tender human\ncare and gentlest sympathy which she alone seemed to have power to call\nout upon his features.  Zenobia, I suspect, would have given her eyes,\nbright as they were, for such a look; it was the least that our poor\nPriscilla could do, to give her heart for a great many of them.  There\nwas the more danger of this, inasmuch as the footing on which we all\nassociated at Blithedale was widely different from that of conventional\nsociety.  While inclining us to the soft affections of the golden age,\nit seemed to authorize any individual, of either sex, to fall in love\nwith any other, regardless of what would elsewhere be judged suitable\nand prudent. Accordingly the tender passion was very rife among us, in\nvarious degrees of mildness or virulence, but mostly passing away with\nthe state of things that had given it origin.  This was all well\nenough; but, for a girl like Priscilla and a woman like Zenobia to\njostle one another in their love of a man like Hollingsworth, was\nlikely to be no child's play.\n\nHad I been as cold-hearted as I sometimes thought myself, nothing would\nhave interested me more than to witness the play of passions that must\nthus have been evolved.  But, in honest truth, I would really have gone\nfar to save Priscilla, at least, from the catastrophe in which such a\ndrama would be apt to terminate.\n\nPriscilla had now grown to be a very pretty girl, and still kept\nbudding and blossoming, and daily putting on some new charm, which you\nno sooner became sensible of than you thought it worth all that she had\npreviously possessed.  So unformed, vague, and without substance, as\nshe had come to us, it seemed as if we could see Nature shaping out a\nwoman before our very eyes, and yet had only a more reverential sense\nof the mystery of a woman's soul and frame. Yesterday, her cheek was\npale, to-day, it had a bloom.  Priscilla's smile, like a baby's first\none, was a wondrous novelty.  Her imperfections and shortcomings\naffected me with a kind of playful pathos, which was as absolutely\nbewitching a sensation as ever I experienced.  After she had been a\nmonth or two at Blithedale, her animal spirits waxed high, and kept her\npretty constantly in a state of bubble and ferment, impelling her to\nfar more bodily activity than she had yet strength to endure.  She was\nvery fond of playing with the other girls out of doors.  There is\nhardly another sight in the world so pretty as that of a company of\nyoung girls, almost women grown, at play, and so giving themselves up\nto their airy impulse that their tiptoes barely touch the ground.\n\nGirls are incomparably wilder and more effervescent than boys, more\nuntamable and regardless of rule and limit, with an ever-shifting\nvariety, breaking continually into new modes of fun, yet with a\nharmonious propriety through all.  Their steps, their voices, appear\nfree as the wind, but keep consonance with a strain of music inaudible\nto us.  Young men and boys, on the other hand, play, according to\nrecognized law, old, traditionary games, permitting no caprioles of\nfancy, but with scope enough for the outbreak of savage instincts.\nFor, young or old, in play or in earnest, man is prone to be a brute.\n\nEspecially is it delightful to see a vigorous young girl run a race,\nwith her head thrown back, her limbs moving more friskily than they\nneed, and an air between that of a bird and a young colt.  But\nPriscilla's peculiar charm, in a foot-race, was the weakness and\nirregularity with which she ran.  Growing up without exercise, except\nto her poor little fingers, she had never yet acquired the perfect use\nof her legs.  Setting buoyantly forth, therefore, as if no rival less\nswift than Atalanta could compete with her, she ran falteringly, and\noften tumbled on the grass.  Such an incident--though it seems too\nslight to think of--was a thing to laugh at, but which brought the\nwater into one's eyes, and lingered in the memory after far greater\njoys and sorrows were wept out of it, as antiquated trash. Priscilla's\nlife, as I beheld it, was full of trifles that affected me in just this\nway.\n\nWhen she had come to be quite at home among us, I used to fancy that\nPriscilla played more pranks, and perpetrated more mischief, than any\nother girl in the Community.  For example, I once heard Silas Foster,\nin a very gruff voice, threatening to rivet three horseshoes round\nPriscilla's neck and chain her to a post, because she, with some other\nyoung people, had clambered upon a load of hay, and caused it to slide\noff the cart.  How she made her peace I never knew; but very soon\nafterwards I saw old Silas, with his brawny hands round Priscilla's\nwaist, swinging her to and fro, and finally depositing her on one of\nthe oxen, to take her first lessons in riding.  She met with terrible\nmishaps in her efforts to milk a cow; she let the poultry into the\ngarden; she generally spoilt whatever part of the dinner she took in\ncharge; she broke crockery; she dropt our biggest water pitcher into\nthe well; and--except with her needle, and those little wooden\ninstruments for purse-making--was as unserviceable a member of society\nas any young lady in the land.  There was no other sort of efficiency\nabout her.  Yet everybody was kind to Priscilla; everybody loved her\nand laughed at her to her face, and did not laugh behind her back;\neverybody would have given her half of his last crust, or the bigger\nshare of his plum-cake.  These were pretty certain indications that we\nwere all conscious of a pleasant weakness in the girl, and considered\nher not quite able to look after her own interests or fight her battle\nwith the world.  And Hollingsworth--perhaps because he had been the\nmeans of introducing Priscilla to her new abode--appeared to recognize\nher as his own especial charge.\n\nHer simple, careless, childish flow of spirits often made me sad. She\nseemed to me like a butterfly at play in a flickering bit of sunshine,\nand mistaking it for a broad and eternal summer.  We sometimes hold\nmirth to a stricter accountability than sorrow; it must show good\ncause, or the echo of its laughter comes back drearily. Priscilla's\ngayety, moreover, was of a nature that showed me how delicate an\ninstrument she was, and what fragile harp-strings were her nerves.  As\nthey made sweet music at the airiest touch, it would require but a\nstronger one to burst them all asunder.  Absurd as it might be, I tried\nto reason with her, and persuade her not to be so joyous, thinking\nthat, if she would draw less lavishly upon her fund of happiness, it\nwould last the longer.  I remember doing so, one summer evening, when\nwe tired laborers sat looking on, like Goldsmith's old folks under the\nvillage thorn-tree, while the young people were at their sports.\n\n\"What is the use or sense of being so very gay?\"  I said to Priscilla,\nwhile she was taking breath, after a great frolic.  \"I love to see a\nsufficient cause for everything, and I can see none for this.  Pray\ntell me, now, what kind of a world you imagine this to be, which you\nare so merry in.\"\n\n\"I never think about it at all,\" answered Priscilla, laughing.  \"But\nthis I am sure of, that it is a world where everybody is kind to me,\nand where I love everybody.  My heart keeps dancing within me, and all\nthe foolish things which you see me do are only the motions of my\nheart.  How can I be dismal, if my heart will not let me?\"\n\n\"Have you nothing dismal to remember?\"  I suggested.  \"If not, then,\nindeed, you are very fortunate!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Priscilla slowly.\n\nAnd then came that unintelligible gesture, when she seemed to be\nlistening to a distant voice.\n\n\"For my part,\" I continued, beneficently seeking to overshadow her with\nmy own sombre humor, \"my past life has been a tiresome one enough; yet\nI would rather look backward ten times than forward once. For, little\nas we know of our life to come, we may be very sure, for one thing,\nthat the good we aim at will not be attained.  People never do get just\nthe good they seek.  If it come at all, it is something else, which\nthey never dreamed of, and did not particularly want.  Then, again, we\nmay rest certain that our friends of to-day will not be our friends of\na few years hence; but, if we keep one of them, it will be at the\nexpense of the others; and most probably we shall keep none.  To be\nsure, there are more to be had; but who cares about making a new set of\nfriends, even should they be better than those around us?\"\n\n\"Not I!\" said Priscilla.  \"I will live and die with these!\"\n\n\"Well; but let the future go,\" resumed I. \"As for the present moment,\nif we could look into the hearts where we wish to be most valued, what\nshould you expect to see?  One's own likeness, in the innermost,\nholiest niche?  Ah!  I don't know!  It may not be there at all.  It may\nbe a dusty image, thrust aside into a corner, and by and by to be flung\nout of doors, where any foot may trample upon it.  If not to-day, then\nto-morrow!  And so, Priscilla, I do not see much wisdom in being so\nvery merry in this kind of a world.\"\n\nIt had taken me nearly seven years of worldly life to hive up the\nbitter honey which I here offered to Priscilla.  And she rejected it!\n\n\"I don't believe one word of what you say!\" she replied, laughing anew.\n\"You made me sad, for a minute, by talking about the past; but the past\nnever comes back again.  Do we dream the same dream twice? There is\nnothing else that I am afraid of.\"\n\nSo away she ran, and fell down on the green grass, as it was often her\nluck to do, but got up again, without any harm.\n\n\"Priscilla, Priscilla!\" cried Hollingsworth, who was sitting on the\ndoorstep; \"you had better not run any more to-night.  You will weary\nyourself too much.  And do not sit down out of doors, for there is a\nheavy dew beginning to fall.\"\n\nAt his first word, she went and sat down under the porch, at\nHollingsworth's feet, entirely contented and happy.  What charm was\nthere in his rude massiveness that so attracted and soothed this\nshadow-like girl?  It appeared to me, who have always been curious in\nsuch matters, that Priscilla's vague and seemingly causeless flow of\nfelicitous feeling was that with which love blesses inexperienced\nhearts, before they begin to suspect what is going on within them. It\ntransports them to the seventh heaven; and if you ask what brought them\nthither, they neither can tell nor care to learn, but cherish an\necstatic faith that there they shall abide forever.\n\nZenobia was in the doorway, not far from Hollingsworth.  She gazed at\nPriscilla in a very singular way.  Indeed, it was a sight worth gazing\nat, and a beautiful sight, too, as the fair girl sat at the feet of\nthat dark, powerful figure.  Her air, while perfectly modest, delicate,\nand virgin-like, denoted her as swayed by Hollingsworth, attracted to\nhim, and unconsciously seeking to rest upon his strength. I could not\nturn away my own eyes, but hoped that nobody, save Zenobia and myself,\nwas witnessing this picture.  It is before me now, with the evening\ntwilight a little deepened by the dusk of memory.\n\n\"Come hither, Priscilla,\" said Zenobia.  \"I have something to say to\nyou.\"\n\nShe spoke in little more than a whisper.  But it is strange how\nexpressive of moods a whisper may often be.  Priscilla felt at once\nthat something had gone wrong.\n\n\"Are you angry with me?\" she asked, rising slowly, and standing before\nZenobia in a drooping attitude.  \"What have I done?  I hope you are not\nangry!\"\n\n\"No, no, Priscilla!\" said Hollingsworth, smiling.  \"I will answer for\nit, she is not.  You are the one little person in the world with whom\nnobody can be angry!\"\n\n\"Angry with you, child?  What a silly idea!\" exclaimed Zenobia,\nlaughing.  \"No, indeed!  But, my dear Priscilla, you are getting to be\nso very pretty that you absolutely need a duenna; and, as I am older\nthan you, and have had my own little experience of life, and think\nmyself exceedingly sage, I intend to fill the place of a maiden aunt.\nEvery day, I shall give you a lecture, a quarter of an hour in length,\non the morals, manners, and proprieties of social life.  When our\npastoral shall be quite played out, Priscilla, my worldly wisdom may\nstand you in good stead.\"\n\n\"I am afraid you are angry with me!\" repeated Priscilla sadly; for,\nwhile she seemed as impressible as wax, the girl often showed a\npersistency in her own ideas as stubborn as it was gentle.\n\n\"Dear me, what can I say to the child!\" cried Zenobia in a tone of\nhumorous vexation.  \"Well, well; since you insist on my being angry,\ncome to my room this moment, and let me beat you!\"\n\nZenobia bade Hollingsworth good-night very sweetly, and nodded to me\nwith a smile.  But, just as she turned aside with Priscilla into the\ndimness of the porch, I caught another glance at her countenance.  It\nwould have made the fortune of a tragic actress, could she have\nborrowed it for the moment when she fumbles in her bosom for the\nconcealed dagger, or the exceedingly sharp bodkin, or mingles the\nratsbane in her lover's bowl of wine or her rival's cup of tea.  Not\nthat I in the least anticipated any such catastrophe,--it being a\nremarkable truth that custom has in no one point a greater sway than\nover our modes of wreaking our wild passions.  And besides, had we been\nin Italy, instead of New England, it was hardly yet a crisis for the\ndagger or the bowl.\n\nIt often amazed me, however, that Hollingsworth should show himself so\nrecklessly tender towards Priscilla, and never once seem to think of\nthe effect which it might have upon her heart.  But the man, as I have\nendeavored to explain, was thrown completely off his moral balance, and\nquite bewildered as to his personal relations, by his great excrescence\nof a philanthropic scheme.  I used to see, or fancy, indications that\nhe was not altogether obtuse to Zenobia's influence as a woman.  No\ndoubt, however, he had a still more exquisite enjoyment of Priscilla's\nsilent sympathy with his purposes, so unalloyed with criticism, and\ntherefore more grateful than any intellectual approbation, which always\ninvolves a possible reserve of latent censure.  A man--poet, prophet,\nor whatever he may be--readily persuades himself of his right to all\nthe worship that is voluntarily tendered.  In requital of so rich\nbenefits as he was to confer upon mankind, it would have been hard to\ndeny Hollingsworth the simple solace of a young girl's heart, which he\nheld in his hand, and smelled too, like a rosebud.  But what if, while\npressing out its fragrance, he should crush the tender rosebud in his\ngrasp!\n\nAs for Zenobia, I saw no occasion to give myself any trouble.  With her\nnative strength, and her experience of the world, she could not be\nsupposed to need any help of mine.  Nevertheless, I was really generous\nenough to feel some little interest likewise for Zenobia. With all her\nfaults (which might have been a great many besides the abundance that I\nknew of), she possessed noble traits, and a heart which must, at least,\nhave been valuable while new.  And she seemed ready to fling it away as\nuncalculatingly as Priscilla herself.  I could not but suspect that, if\nmerely at play with Hollingsworth, she was sporting with a power which\nshe did not fully estimate.  Or if in earnest, it might chance, between\nZenobia's passionate force and his dark, self-delusive egotism, to turn\nout such earnest as would develop itself in some sufficiently tragic\ncatastrophe, though the dagger and the bowl should go for nothing in it.\n\nMeantime, the gossip of the Community set them down as a pair of\nlovers.  They took walks together, and were not seldom encountered in\nthe wood-paths: Hollingsworth deeply discoursing, in tones solemn and\nsternly pathetic; Zenobia, with a rich glow on her cheeks, and her eyes\nsoftened from their ordinary brightness, looked so beautiful, that had\nher companion been ten times a philanthropist, it seemed impossible but\nthat one glance should melt him back into a man. Oftener than anywhere\nelse, they went to a certain point on the slope of a pasture,\ncommanding nearly the whole of our own domain, besides a view of the\nriver, and an airy prospect of many distant hills.  The bond of our\nCommunity was such, that the members had the privilege of building\ncottages for their own residence within our precincts, thus laying a\nhearthstone and fencing in a home private and peculiar to all desirable\nextent, while yet the inhabitants should continue to share the\nadvantages of an associated life.  It was inferred that Hollingsworth\nand Zenobia intended to rear their dwelling on this favorite spot.\n\nI mentioned those rumors to Hollingsworth in a playful way.\n\n\"Had you consulted me,\" I went on to observe, \"I should have\nrecommended a site farther to the left, just a little withdrawn into\nthe wood, with two or three peeps at the prospect among the trees. You\nwill be in the shady vale of years long before you can raise any better\nkind of shade around your cottage, if you build it on this bare slope.\"\n\n\"But I offer my edifice as a spectacle to the world,\" said\nHollingsworth, \"that it may take example and build many another like\nit.  Therefore, I mean to set it on the open hillside.\"\n\nTwist these words how I might, they offered no very satisfactory\nimport.  It seemed hardly probable that Hollingsworth should care about\neducating the public taste in the department of cottage architecture,\ndesirable as such improvement certainly was.\n\n\n\nX. A VISITOR FROM TOWN\n\nHollingsworth and I--we had been hoeing potatoes, that forenoon, while\nthe rest of the fraternity were engaged in a distant quarter of the\nfarm--sat under a clump of maples, eating our eleven o'clock lunch,\nwhen we saw a stranger approaching along the edge of the field. He had\nadmitted himself from the roadside through a turnstile, and seemed to\nhave a purpose of speaking with us.\n\nAnd, by the bye, we were favored with many visits at Blithedale,\nespecially from people who sympathized with our theories, and perhaps\nheld themselves ready to unite in our actual experiment as soon as\nthere should appear a reliable promise of its success.  It was rather\nludicrous, indeed (to me, at least, whose enthusiasm had insensibly\nbeen exhaled together with the perspiration of many a hard day's toil),\nit was absolutely funny, therefore, to observe what a glory was shed\nabout our life and labors, in the imaginations of these longing\nproselytes.  In their view, we were as poetical as Arcadians, besides\nbeing as practical as the hardest-fisted husbandmen in Massachusetts.\nWe did not, it is true, spend much time in piping to our sheep, or\nwarbling our innocent loves to the sisterhood.  But they gave us credit\nfor imbuing the ordinary rustic occupations with a kind of religious\npoetry, insomuch that our very cow-yards and pig-sties were as\ndelightfully fragrant as a flower garden.  Nothing used to please me\nmore than to see one of these lay enthusiasts snatch up a hoe, as they\nwere very prone to do, and set to work with a vigor that perhaps\ncarried him through about a dozen ill-directed strokes.  Men are\nwonderfully soon satisfied, in this day of shameful bodily enervation,\nwhen, from one end of life to the other, such multitudes never taste\nthe sweet weariness that follows accustomed toil.  I seldom saw the new\nenthusiasm that did not grow as flimsy and flaccid as the proselyte's\nmoistened shirt-collar, with a quarter of an hour's active labor under\na July sun.\n\nBut the person now at hand had not at all the air of one of these\namiable visionaries.  He was an elderly man, dressed rather shabbily,\nyet decently enough, in a gray frock-coat, faded towards a brown hue,\nand wore a broad-brimmed white hat, of the fashion of several years\ngone by.  His hair was perfect silver, without a dark thread in the\nwhole of it; his nose, though it had a scarlet tip, by no means\nindicated the jollity of which a red nose is the generally admitted\nsymbol.  He was a subdued, undemonstrative old man, who would doubtless\ndrink a glass of liquor, now and then, and probably more than was good\nfor him,--not, however, with a purpose of undue exhilaration, but in\nthe hope of bringing his spirits up to the ordinary level of the\nworld's cheerfulness.  Drawing nearer, there was a shy look about him,\nas if he were ashamed of his poverty, or, at any rate, for some reason\nor other, would rather have us glance at him sidelong than take a full\nfront view.  He had a queer appearance of hiding himself behind the\npatch on his left eye.\n\n\"I know this old gentleman,\" said I to Hollingsworth, as we sat\nobserving him; \"that is, I have met him a hundred times in town, and\nhave often amused my fancy with wondering what he was before he came to\nbe what he is.  He haunts restaurants and such places, and has an odd\nway of lurking in corners or getting behind a door whenever\npracticable, and holding out his hand with some little article in it\nwhich he wishes you to buy.  The eye of the world seems to trouble him,\nalthough he necessarily lives so much in it.  I never expected to see\nhim in an open field.\"\n\n\"Have you learned anything of his history?\" asked Hollingsworth.\n\n\"Not a circumstance,\" I answered; \"but there must be something curious\nin it.  I take him to be a harmless sort of a person, and a tolerably\nhonest one; but his manners, being so furtive, remind me of those of a\nrat,--a rat without the mischief, the fierce eye, the teeth to bite\nwith, or the desire to bite.  See, now!  He means to skulk along that\nfringe of bushes, and approach us on the other side of our clump of\nmaples.\"\n\nWe soon heard the old man's velvet tread on the grass, indicating that\nhe had arrived within a few feet of where we Sat.\n\n\"Good-morning, Mr. Moodie,\" said Hollingsworth, addressing the stranger\nas an acquaintance; \"you must have had a hot and tiresome walk from the\ncity.  Sit down, and take a morsel of our bread and cheese.\"\n\nThe visitor made a grateful little murmur of acquiescence, and sat down\nin a spot somewhat removed; so that, glancing round, I could see his\ngray pantaloons and dusty shoes, while his upper part was mostly hidden\nbehind the shrubbery.  Nor did he come forth from this retirement\nduring the whole of the interview that followed.  We handed him such\nfood as we had, together with a brown jug of molasses and water (would\nthat it had been brandy, or some thing better, for the sake of his\nchill old heart!), like priests offering dainty sacrifice to an\nenshrined and invisible idol.  I have no idea that he really lacked\nsustenance; but it was quite touching, nevertheless, to hear him\nnibbling away at our crusts.\n\n\"Mr. Moodie,\" said I, \"do you remember selling me one of those very\npretty little silk purses, of which you seem to have a monopoly in the\nmarket?  I keep it to this day, I can assure you.\"\n\n\"Ah, thank you,\" said our guest.  \"Yes, Mr. Coverdale, I used to sell a\ngood many of those little purses.\"\n\nHe spoke languidly, and only those few words, like a watch with an\ninelastic spring, that just ticks a moment or two and stops again. He\nseemed a very forlorn old man.  In the wantonness of youth, strength,\nand comfortable condition,--making my prey of people's individualities,\nas my custom was,--I tried to identify my mind with the old fellow's,\nand take his view of the world, as if looking through a smoke-blackened\nglass at the sun.  It robbed the landscape of all its life.  Those\npleasantly swelling slopes of our farm, descending towards the wide\nmeadows, through which sluggishly circled the brimful tide of the\nCharles, bathing the long sedges on its hither and farther shores; the\nbroad, sunny gleam over the winding water; that peculiar\npicturesqueness of the scene where capes and headlands put themselves\nboldly forth upon the perfect level of the meadow, as into a green\nlake, with inlets between the promontories; the shadowy woodland, with\ntwinkling showers of light falling into its depths; the sultry\nheat-vapor, which rose everywhere like incense, and in which my soul\ndelighted, as indicating so rich a fervor in the passionate day, and in\nthe earth that was burning with its love,--I beheld all these things as\nthrough old Moodie's eyes.  When my eyes are dimmer than they have yet\ncome to be, I will go thither again, and see if I did not catch the\ntone of his mind aright, and if the cold and lifeless tint of his\nperceptions be not then repeated in my own.\n\nYet it was unaccountable to myself, the interest that I felt in him.\n\n\"Have you any objection,\" said I, \"to telling me who made those little\npurses?\"\n\n\"Gentlemen have often asked me that,\" said Moodie slowly; \"but I shake\nmy head, and say little or nothing, and creep out of the way as well as\nI can.  I am a man of few words; and if gentlemen were to be told one\nthing, they would be very apt, I suppose, to ask me another. But it\nhappens just now, Mr. Coverdale, that you can tell me more about the\nmaker of those little purses than I can tell you.\"\n\n\"Why do you trouble him with needless questions, Coverdale?\"\ninterrupted Hollingsworth.  \"You must have known, long ago, that it was\nPriscilla.  And so, my good friend, you have come to see her? Well, I\nam glad of it.  You will find her altered very much for the better,\nsince that winter evening when you put her into my charge. Why,\nPriscilla has a bloom in her cheeks, now!\"\n\n\"Has my pale little girl a bloom?\" repeated Moodie with a kind of slow\nwonder.  \"Priscilla with a bloom in her cheeks!  Ah, I am afraid I\nshall not know my little girl.  And is she happy?\"\n\n\"Just as happy as a bird,\" answered Hollingsworth.\n\n\"Then, gentlemen,\" said our guest apprehensively, \"I don't think it\nwell for me to go any farther.  I crept hitherward only to ask about\nPriscilla; and now that you have told me such good news, perhaps I can\ndo no better than to creep back again.  If she were to see this old\nface of mine, the child would remember some very sad times which we\nhave spent together.  Some very sad times, indeed!  She has forgotten\nthem, I know,--them and me,--else she could not be so happy, nor have a\nbloom in her cheeks.  Yes--yes--yes,\" continued he, still with the same\ntorpid utterance; \"with many thanks to you, Mr. Hollingsworth, I will\ncreep back to town again.\"\n\n\"You shall do no such thing, Mr. Moodie,\" said Hollingsworth bluffly.\n\"Priscilla often speaks of you; and if there lacks anything to make her\ncheeks bloom like two damask roses, I'll venture to say it is just the\nsight of your face.  Come,--we will go and find her.\"\n\n\"Mr. Hollingsworth!\" said the old man in his hesitating way.\n\n\"Well,\" answered Hollingsworth.\n\n\"Has there been any call for Priscilla?\" asked Moodie; and though his\nface was hidden from us, his tone gave a sure indication of the\nmysterious nod and wink with which he put the question.  \"You know, I\nthink, sir, what I mean.\"\n\n\"I have not the remotest suspicion what you mean, Mr. Moodie,\" replied\nHollingsworth; \"nobody, to my knowledge, has called for Priscilla,\nexcept yourself.  But come; we are losing time, and I have several\nthings to say to you by the way.\"\n\n\"And, Mr. Hollingsworth!\" repeated Moodie.\n\n\"Well, again!\" cried my friend rather impatiently.  \"What now?\"\n\n\"There is a lady here,\" said the old man; and his voice lost some of\nits wearisome hesitation.  \"You will account it a very strange matter\nfor me to talk about; but I chanced to know this lady when she was but\na little child.  If I am rightly informed, she has grown to be a very\nfine woman, and makes a brilliant figure in the world, with her beauty,\nand her talents, and her noble way of spending her riches.  I should\nrecognize this lady, so people tell me, by a magnificent flower in her\nhair.\"\n\n\"What a rich tinge it gives to his colorless ideas, when he speaks of\nZenobia!\"  I whispered to Hollingsworth.  \"But how can there possibly\nbe any interest or connecting link between him and her?\"\n\n\"The old man, for years past,\" whispered Hollingsworth, \"has been a\nlittle out of his right mind, as you probably see.\"\n\n\"What I would inquire,\" resumed Moodie, \"is whether this beautiful lady\nis kind to my poor Priscilla.\"\n\n\"Very kind,\" said Hollingsworth.\n\n\"Does she love her?\" asked Moodie.\n\n\"It should seem so,\" answered my friend.  \"They are always together.\"\n\n\"Like a gentlewoman and her maid-servant, I fancy?\" suggested the old\nman.\n\nThere was something so singular in his way of saying this, that I could\nnot resist the impulse to turn quite round, so as to catch a glimpse of\nhis face, almost imagining that I should see another person than old\nMoodie.  But there he sat, with the patched side of his face towards me.\n\n\"Like an elder and younger sister, rather,\" replied Hollingsworth.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Moodie more complacently, for his latter tones had harshness\nand acidity in them,--\"it would gladden my old heart to witness that.\nIf one thing would make me happier than another, Mr. Hollingsworth, it\nwould be to see that beautiful lady holding my little girl by the hand.\"\n\n\"Come along,\" said Hollingsworth, \"and perhaps you may.\"\n\nAfter a little more delay on the part of our freakish visitor, they set\nforth together, old Moodie keeping a step or two behind Hollingsworth,\nso that the latter could not very conveniently look him in the face.  I\nremained under the tuft of maples, doing my utmost to draw an inference\nfrom the scene that had just passed.  In spite of Hollingsworth's\noff-hand explanation, it did not strike me that our strange guest was\nreally beside himself, but only that his mind needed screwing up, like\nan instrument long out of tune, the strings of which have ceased to\nvibrate smartly and sharply. Methought it would be profitable for us,\nprojectors of a happy life, to welcome this old gray shadow, and\ncherish him as one of us, and let him creep about our domain, in order\nthat he might be a little merrier for our sakes, and we, sometimes, a\nlittle sadder for his. Human destinies look ominous without some\nperceptible intermixture of the sable or the gray.  And then, too,\nshould any of our fraternity grow feverish with an over-exulting sense\nof prosperity, it would be a sort of cooling regimen to slink off into\nthe woods, and spend an hour, or a day, or as many days as might be\nrequisite to the cure, in uninterrupted communion with this deplorable\nold Moodie!\n\nGoing homeward to dinner, I had a glimpse of him, behind the trunk of a\ntree, gazing earnestly towards a particular window of the farmhouse;\nand by and by Priscilla appeared at this window, playfully drawing\nalong Zenobia, who looked as bright as the very day that was blazing\ndown upon us, only not, by many degrees, so well advanced towards her\nnoon.  I was convinced that this pretty sight must have been purposely\narranged by Priscilla for the old man to see.  But either the girl held\nher too long, or her fondness was resented as too great a freedom; for\nZenobia suddenly put Priscilla decidedly away, and gave her a haughty\nlook, as from a mistress to a dependant.  Old Moodie shook his head;\nand again and again I saw him shake it, as he withdrew along the road;\nand at the last point whence the farmhouse was visible, he turned and\nshook his uplifted staff.\n\n\n\nXI. THE WOOD-PATH\n\nNot long after the preceding incident, in order to get the ache of too\nconstant labor out of my bones, and to relieve my spirit of the\nirksomeness of a settled routine, I took a holiday.  It was my purpose\nto spend it all alone, from breakfast-time till twilight, in the\ndeepest wood-seclusion that lay anywhere around us.  Though fond of\nsociety, I was so constituted as to need these occasional retirements,\neven in a life like that of Blithedale, which was itself characterized\nby a remoteness from the world.  Unless renewed by a yet further\nwithdrawal towards the inner circle of self-communion, I lost the\nbetter part of my individuality.  My thoughts became of little worth,\nand my sensibilities grew as arid as a tuft of moss (a thing whose life\nis in the shade, the rain, or the noontide dew), crumbling in the\nsunshine after long expectance of a shower.  So, with my heart full of\na drowsy pleasure, and cautious not to dissipate my mood by previous\nintercourse with any one, I hurried away, and was soon pacing a\nwood-path, arched overhead with boughs, and dusky-brown beneath my feet.\n\nAt first I walked very swiftly, as if the heavy flood tide of social\nlife were roaring at my heels, and would outstrip and overwhelm me,\nwithout all the better diligence in my escape.  But, threading the more\ndistant windings of the track, I abated my pace, and looked about me\nfor some side-aisle, that should admit me into the innermost sanctuary\nof this green cathedral, just as, in human acquaintanceship, a casual\nopening sometimes lets us, all of a sudden, into the long-sought\nintimacy of a mysterious heart.  So much was I absorbed in my\nreflections,--or, rather, in my mood, the substance of which was as yet\ntoo shapeless to be called thought,--that footsteps rustled on the\nleaves, and a figure passed me by, almost without impressing either the\nsound or sight upon my consciousness.\n\nA moment afterwards, I heard a voice at a little distance behind me,\nspeaking so sharply and impertinently that it made a complete discord\nwith my spiritual state, and caused the latter to vanish as abruptly as\nwhen you thrust a finger into a soap-bubble.\n\n\"Halloo, friend!\" cried this most unseasonable voice.  \"Stop a moment,\nI say!  I must have a word with you!\"\n\nI turned about, in a humor ludicrously irate.  In the first place, the\ninterruption, at any rate, was a grievous injury; then, the tone\ndispleased me.  And finally, unless there be real affection in his\nheart, a man cannot,--such is the bad state to which the world has\nbrought itself,--cannot more effectually show his contempt for a\nbrother mortal, nor more gallingly assume a position of superiority,\nthan by addressing him as \"friend.\"  Especially does the misapplication\nof this phrase bring out that latent hostility which is sure to animate\npeculiar sects, and those who, with however generous a purpose, have\nsequestered themselves from the crowd; a feeling, it is true, which may\nbe hidden in some dog-kennel of the heart, grumbling there in the\ndarkness, but is never quite extinct, until the dissenting party have\ngained power and scope enough to treat the world generously.  For my\npart, I should have taken it as far less an insult to be styled\n\"fellow,\" \"clown,\" or \"bumpkin.\"  To either of these appellations my\nrustic garb (it was a linen blouse, with checked shirt and striped\npantaloons, a chip hat on my head, and a rough hickory stick in my\nhand) very fairly entitled me.  As the case stood, my temper darted at\nonce to the opposite pole; not friend, but enemy!\n\n\"What do you want with me?\" said I, facing about.\n\n\"Come a little nearer, friend,\" said the stranger, beckoning.\n\n\"No,\" answered I. \"If I can do anything for you without too much\ntrouble to myself, say so.  But recollect, if you please, that you are\nnot speaking to an acquaintance, much less a friend!\"\n\n\"Upon my word, I believe not!\" retorted he, looking at me with some\ncuriosity; and, lifting his hat, he made me a salute which had enough\nof sarcasm to be offensive, and just enough of doubtful courtesy to\nrender any resentment of it absurd.  \"But I ask your pardon!  I\nrecognize a little mistake.  If I may take the liberty to suppose it,\nyou, sir, are probably one of the aesthetic--or shall I rather say\necstatic?--laborers, who have planted themselves hereabouts.  This is\nyour forest of Arden; and you are either the banished Duke in person,\nor one of the chief nobles in his train.  The melancholy Jacques,\nperhaps?  Be it so.  In that case, you can probably do me a favor.\"\n\nI never, in my life, felt less inclined to confer a favor on any man.\n\n\"I am busy,\" said I.\n\nSo unexpectedly had the stranger made me sensible of his presence, that\nhe had almost the effect of an apparition; and certainly a less\nappropriate one (taking into view the dim woodland solitude about us)\nthan if the salvage man of antiquity, hirsute and cinctured with a\nleafy girdle, had started out of a thicket.  He was still young,\nseemingly a little under thirty, of a tall and well-developed figure,\nand as handsome a man as ever I beheld.  The style of his beauty,\nhowever, though a masculine style, did not at all commend itself to my\ntaste.  His countenance--I hardly know how to describe the\npeculiarity--had an indecorum in it, a kind of rudeness, a hard,\ncoarse, forth-putting freedom of expression, which no degree of\nexternal polish could have abated one single jot.  Not that it was\nvulgar.  But he had no fineness of nature; there was in his eyes\n(although they might have artifice enough of another sort) the naked\nexposure of something that ought not to be left prominent.  With these\nvague allusions to what I have seen in other faces as well as his, I\nleave the quality to be comprehended best--because with an intuitive\nrepugnance--by those who possess least of it.\n\nHis hair, as well as his beard and mustache, was coal-black; his eyes,\ntoo, were black and sparkling, and his teeth remarkably brilliant. He\nwas rather carelessly but well and fashionably dressed, in a\nsummer-morning costume.  There was a gold chain, exquisitely wrought,\nacross his vest.  I never saw a smoother or whiter gloss than that upon\nhis shirt-bosom, which had a pin in it, set with a gem that glimmered,\nin the leafy shadow where he stood, like a living tip of fire.  He\ncarried a stick with a wooden head, carved in vivid imitation of that\nof a serpent.  I hated him, partly, I do believe, from a comparison of\nmy own homely garb with his well-ordered foppishness.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said I, a little ashamed of my first irritation, but still\nwith no waste of civility, \"be pleased to speak at once, as I have my\nown business in hand.\"\n\n\"I regret that my mode of addressing you was a little unfortunate,\"\nsaid the stranger, smiling; for he seemed a very acute sort of person,\nand saw, in some degree, how I stood affected towards him.  \"I intended\nno offence, and shall certainly comport myself with due ceremony\nhereafter.  I merely wish to make a few inquiries respecting a lady,\nformerly of my acquaintance, who is now resident in your Community,\nand, I believe, largely concerned in your social enterprise.  You call\nher, I think, Zenobia.\"\n\n\"That is her name in literature,\" observed I; \"a name, too, which\npossibly she may permit her private friends to know and address her\nby,--but not one which they feel at liberty to recognize when used of\nher personally by a stranger or casual acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" answered this disagreeable person; and he turned aside his\nface for an instant with a brief laugh, which struck me as a noteworthy\nexpression of his character.  \"Perhaps I might put forward a claim, on\nyour own grounds, to call the lady by a name so appropriate to her\nsplendid qualities.  But I am willing to know her by any cognomen that\nyou may suggest.\"\n\nHeartily wishing that he would be either a little more offensive, or a\ngood deal less so, or break off our intercourse altogether, I mentioned\nZenobia's real name.\n\n\"True,\" said he; \"and in general society I have never heard her called\notherwise.  And, after all, our discussion of the point has been\ngratuitous.  My object is only to inquire when, where, and how this\nlady may most conveniently be seen.\"\n\n\"At her present residence, of course,\" I replied.  \"You have but to go\nthither and ask for her.  This very path will lead you within sight of\nthe house; so I wish you good-morning.\"\n\n\"One moment, if you please,\" said the stranger.  \"The course you\nindicate would certainly be the proper one, in an ordinary morning\ncall.  But my business is private, personal, and somewhat peculiar.\nNow, in a community like this, I should judge that any little\noccurrence is likely to be discussed rather more minutely than would\nquite suit my views.  I refer solely to myself, you understand, and\nwithout intimating that it would be other than a matter of entire\nindifference to the lady.  In short, I especially desire to see her in\nprivate.  If her habits are such as I have known them, she is probably\noften to be met with in the woods, or by the river-side; and I think\nyou could do me the favor to point out some favorite walk, where, about\nthis hour, I might be fortunate enough to gain an interview.\"\n\nI reflected that it would be quite a supererogatory piece of Quixotism\nin me to undertake the guardianship of Zenobia, who, for my pains,\nwould only make me the butt of endless ridicule, should the fact ever\ncome to her knowledge.  I therefore described a spot which, as often as\nany other, was Zenobia's resort at this period of the day; nor was it\nso remote from the farmhouse as to leave her in much peril, whatever\nmight be the stranger's character.\n\n\"A single word more,\" said he; and his black eyes sparkled at me,\nwhether with fun or malice I knew not, but certainly as if the Devil\nwere peeping out of them.  \"Among your fraternity, I understand, there\nis a certain holy and benevolent blacksmith; a man of iron, in more\nsenses than one; a rough, cross-grained, well-meaning individual,\nrather boorish in his manners, as might be expected, and by no means of\nthe highest intellectual cultivation.  He is a philanthropical\nlecturer, with two or three disciples, and a scheme of his own, the\npreliminary step in which involves a large purchase of land, and the\nerection of a spacious edifice, at an expense considerably beyond his\nmeans; inasmuch as these are to be reckoned in copper or old iron much\nmore conveniently than in gold or silver.  He hammers away upon his one\ntopic as lustily as ever he did upon a horseshoe!  Do you know such a\nperson?\"  I shook my head, and was turning away.  \"Our friend,\" he\ncontinued, \"is described to me as a brawny, shaggy, grim, and\nill-favored personage, not particularly well calculated, one would say,\nto insinuate himself with the softer sex.  Yet, so far has this honest\nfellow succeeded with one lady whom we wot of, that he anticipates,\nfrom her abundant resources, the necessary funds for realizing his plan\nin brick and mortar!\"\n\nHere the stranger seemed to be so much amused with his sketch of\nHollingsworth's character and purposes, that he burst into a fit of\nmerriment, of the same nature as the brief, metallic laugh already\nalluded to, but immensely prolonged and enlarged.  In the excess of his\ndelight, he opened his mouth wide, and disclosed a gold band around the\nupper part of his teeth, thereby making it apparent that every one of\nhis brilliant grinders and incisors was a sham.  This discovery\naffected me very oddly.\n\nI felt as if the whole man were a moral and physical humbug; his\nwonderful beauty of face, for aught I knew, might be removable like a\nmask; and, tall and comely as his figure looked, he was perhaps but a\nwizened little elf, gray and decrepit, with nothing genuine about him\nsave the wicked expression of his grin.  The fantasy of his spectral\ncharacter so wrought upon me, together with the contagion of his\nstrange mirth on my sympathies, that I soon began to laugh as loudly as\nhimself.\n\nBy and by, he paused all at once; so suddenly, indeed, that my own\ncachinnation lasted a moment longer.\n\n\"Ah, excuse me!\" said he.  \"Our interview seems to proceed more merrily\nthan it began.\"\n\n\"It ends here,\" answered I. \"And I take shame to myself that my folly\nhas lost me the right of resenting your ridicule of a friend.\"\n\n\"Pray allow me,\" said the stranger, approaching a step nearer, and\nlaying his gloved hand on my sleeve.  \"One other favor I must ask of\nyou.  You have a young person here at Blithedale, of whom I have\nheard,--whom, perhaps, I have known,--and in whom, at all events, I\ntake a peculiar interest.  She is one of those delicate, nervous young\ncreatures, not uncommon in New England, and whom I suppose to have\nbecome what we find them by the gradual refining away of the physical\nsystem among your women.  Some philosophers choose to glorify this\nhabit of body by terming it spiritual; but, in my opinion, it is rather\nthe effect of unwholesome food, bad air, lack of outdoor exercise, and\nneglect of bathing, on the part of these damsels and their female\nprogenitors, all resulting in a kind of hereditary dyspepsia.  Zenobia,\neven with her uncomfortable surplus of vitality, is far the better\nmodel of womanhood.  But--to revert again to this young person--she\ngoes among you by the name of Priscilla.  Could you possibly afford me\nthe means of speaking with her?\"\n\n\"You have made so many inquiries of me,\" I observed, \"that I may at\nleast trouble you with one.  What is your name?\"\n\nHe offered me a card, with \"Professor Westervelt\" engraved on it.  At\nthe same time, as if to vindicate his claim to the professorial\ndignity, so often assumed on very questionable grounds, he put on a\npair of spectacles, which so altered the character of his face that I\nhardly knew him again.  But I liked the present aspect no better than\nthe former one.\n\n\"I must decline any further connection with your affairs,\" said I,\ndrawing back.  \"I have told you where to find Zenobia.  As for\nPriscilla, she has closer friends than myself, through whom, if they\nsee fit, you can gain access to her.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" returned the Professor, ceremoniously raising his hat,\n\"good-morning to you.\"\n\nHe took his departure, and was soon out of sight among the windings of\nthe wood-path.  But after a little reflection, I could not help\nregretting that I had so peremptorily broken off the interview, while\nthe stranger seemed inclined to continue it.  His evident knowledge of\nmatters affecting my three friends might have led to disclosures or\ninferences that would perhaps have been serviceable.  I was\nparticularly struck with the fact that, ever since the appearance of\nPriscilla, it had been the tendency of events to suggest and establish\na connection between Zenobia and her.  She had come, in the first\ninstance, as if with the sole purpose of claiming Zenobia's protection.\nOld Moodie's visit, it appeared, was chiefly to ascertain whether this\nobject had been accomplished.  And here, to-day, was the questionable\nProfessor, linking one with the other in his inquiries, and seeking\ncommunication with both.\n\nMeanwhile, my inclination for a ramble having been balked, I lingered\nin the vicinity of the farm, with perhaps a vague idea that some new\nevent would grow out of Westervelt's proposed interview with Zenobia.\nMy own part in these transactions was singularly subordinate.  It\nresembled that of the Chorus in a classic play, which seems to be set\naloof from the possibility of personal concernment, and bestows the\nwhole measure of its hope or fear, its exultation or sorrow, on the\nfortunes of others, between whom and itself this sympathy is the only\nbond.  Destiny, it may be,--the most skilful of stage managers,--seldom\nchooses to arrange its scenes, and carry forward its drama, without\nsecuring the presence of at least one calm observer.  It is his office\nto give applause when due, and sometimes an inevitable tear, to detect\nthe final fitness of incident to character, and distil in his\nlong-brooding thought the whole morality of the performance.\n\nNot to be out of the way in case there were need of me in my vocation,\nand, at the same time, to avoid thrusting myself where neither destiny\nnor mortals might desire my presence, I remained pretty near the verge\nof the woodlands.  My position was off the track of Zenobia's customary\nwalk, yet not so remote but that a recognized occasion might speedily\nhave brought me thither.\n\n\n\nXII. COVERDALE'S HERMITAGE\n\nLong since, in this part of our circumjacent wood, I had found out for\nmyself a little hermitage.  It was a kind of leafy cave, high upward\ninto the air, among the midmost branches of a white-pine tree. A wild\ngrapevine, of unusual size and luxuriance, had twined and twisted\nitself up into the tree, and, after wreathing the entanglement of its\ntendrils around almost every bough, had caught hold of three or four\nneighboring trees, and married the whole clump with a perfectly\ninextricable knot of polygamy.  Once, while sheltering myself from a\nsummer shower, the fancy had taken me to clamber up into this seemingly\nimpervious mass of foliage.  The branches yielded me a passage, and\nclosed again beneath, as if only a squirrel or a bird had passed.  Far\naloft, around the stem of the central pine, behold a perfect nest for\nRobinson Crusoe or King Charles!  A hollow chamber of rare seclusion\nhad been formed by the decay of some of the pine branches, which the\nvine had lovingly strangled with its embrace, burying them from the\nlight of day in an aerial sepulchre of its own leaves.  It cost me but\nlittle ingenuity to enlarge the interior, and open loopholes through\nthe verdant walls.  Had it ever been my fortune to spend a honeymoon, I\nshould have thought seriously of inviting my bride up thither, where\nour next neighbors would have been two orioles in another part of the\nclump.\n\nIt was an admirable place to make verses, tuning the rhythm to the\nbreezy symphony that so often stirred among the vine leaves; or to\nmeditate an essay for \"The Dial,\" in which the many tongues of Nature\nwhispered mysteries, and seemed to ask only a little stronger puff of\nwind to speak out the solution of its riddle.  Being so pervious to\nair-currents, it was just the nook, too, for the enjoyment of a cigar.\nThis hermitage was my one exclusive possession while I counted myself a\nbrother of the socialists.  It symbolized my individuality, and aided\nme in keeping it inviolate.  None ever found me out in it, except,\nonce, a squirrel.  I brought thither no guest, because, after\nHollingsworth failed me, there was no longer the man alive with whom I\ncould think of sharing all.  So there I used to sit, owl-like, yet not\nwithout liberal and hospitable thoughts.  I counted the innumerable\nclusters of my vine, and fore-reckoned the abundance of my vintage.  It\ngladdened me to anticipate the surprise of the Community, when, like an\nallegorical figure of rich October, I should make my appearance, with\nshoulders bent beneath the burden of ripe grapes, and some of the\ncrushed ones crimsoning my brow as with a bloodstain.\n\nAscending into this natural turret, I peeped in turn out of several of\nits small windows.  The pine-tree, being ancient, rose high above the\nrest of the wood, which was of comparatively recent growth.  Even where\nI sat, about midway between the root and the topmost bough, my position\nwas lofty enough to serve as an observatory, not for starry\ninvestigations, but for those sublunary matters in which lay a lore as\ninfinite as that of the planets.  Through one loophole I saw the river\nlapsing calmly onward, while in the meadow, near its brink, a few of\nthe brethren were digging peat for our winter's fuel.  On the interior\ncart-road of our farm I discerned Hollingsworth, with a yoke of oxen\nhitched to a drag of stones, that were to be piled into a fence, on\nwhich we employed ourselves at the odd intervals of other labor.  The\nharsh tones of his voice, shouting to the sluggish steers, made me\nsensible, even at such a distance, that he was ill at ease, and that\nthe balked philanthropist had the battle-spirit in his heart.\n\n\"Haw, Buck!\" quoth he.  \"Come along there, ye lazy ones!  What are ye\nabout, now?  Gee!\"\n\n\"Mankind, in Hollingsworth's opinion,\" thought I, \"is but another yoke\nof oxen, as stubborn, stupid, and sluggish as our old Brown and Bright.\nHe vituperates us aloud, and curses us in his heart, and will begin to\nprick us with the goad-stick, by and by.  But are we his oxen?  And\nwhat right has he to be the driver?  And why, when there is enough else\nto do, should we waste our strength in dragging home the ponderous load\nof his philanthropic absurdities?  At my height above the earth, the\nwhole matter looks ridiculous!\"\n\nTurning towards the farmhouse, I saw Priscilla (for, though a great way\noff, the eye of faith assured me that it was she) sitting at Zenobia's\nwindow, and making little purses, I suppose; or, perhaps, mending the\nCommunity's old linen.  A bird flew past my tree; and, as it clove its\nway onward into the sunny atmosphere, I flung it a message for\nPriscilla.\n\n\"Tell her,\" said I, \"that her fragile thread of life has inextricably\nknotted itself with other and tougher threads, and most likely it will\nbe broken.  Tell her that Zenobia will not be long her friend. Say that\nHollingsworth's heart is on fire with his own purpose, but icy for all\nhuman affection; and that, if she has given him her love, it is like\ncasting a flower into a sepulchre.  And say that if any mortal really\ncares for her, it is myself; and not even I for her realities,--poor\nlittle seamstress, as Zenobia rightly called her!--but for the\nfancy-work with which I have idly decked her out!\"\n\nThe pleasant scent of the wood, evolved by the hot sun, stole up to my\nnostrils, as if I had been an idol in its niche.  Many trees mingled\ntheir fragrance into a thousand-fold odor.  Possibly there was a\nsensual influence in the broad light of noon that lay beneath me.  It\nmay have been the cause, in part, that I suddenly found myself\npossessed by a mood of disbelief in moral beauty or heroism, and a\nconviction of the folly of attempting to benefit the world. Our\nespecial scheme of reform, which, from my observatory, I could take in\nwith the bodily eye, looked so ridiculous that it was impossible not to\nlaugh aloud.\n\n\"But the joke is a little too heavy,\" thought I. \"If I were wise, I\nshould get out of the scrape with all diligence, and then laugh at my\ncompanions for remaining in it.\"\n\nWhile thus musing, I heard with perfect distinctness, somewhere in the\nwood beneath, the peculiar laugh which I have described as one of the\ndisagreeable characteristics of Professor Westervelt.  It brought my\nthoughts back to our recent interview.  I recognized as chiefly due to\nthis man's influence the sceptical and sneering view which just now had\nfilled my mental vision in regard to all life's better purposes.  And\nit was through his eyes, more than my own, that I was looking at\nHollingsworth, with his glorious if impracticable dream, and at the\nnoble earthliness of Zenobia's character, and even at Priscilla, whose\nimpalpable grace lay so singularly between disease and beauty.  The\nessential charm of each had vanished.  There are some spheres the\ncontact with which inevitably degrades the high, debases the pure,\ndeforms the beautiful.  It must be a mind of uncommon strength, and\nlittle impressibility, that can permit itself the habit of such\nintercourse, and not be permanently deteriorated; and yet the\nProfessor's tone represented that of worldly society at large, where a\ncold scepticism smothers what it can of our spiritual aspirations, and\nmakes the rest ridiculous.  I detested this kind of man; and all the\nmore because a part of my own nature showed itself responsive to him.\n\nVoices were now approaching through the region of the wood which lay in\nthe vicinity of my tree.  Soon I caught glimpses of two figures--a\nwoman and a man--Zenobia and the stranger--earnestly talking together\nas they advanced.\n\nZenobia had a rich though varying color.  It was, most of the while, a\nflame, and anon a sudden paleness.  Her eyes glowed, so that their\nlight sometimes flashed upward to me, as when the sun throws a dazzle\nfrom some bright object on the ground.  Her gestures were free, and\nstrikingly impressive.  The whole woman was alive with a passionate\nintensity, which I now perceived to be the phase in which her beauty\nculminated.  Any passion would have become her well; and passionate\nlove, perhaps, the best of all.  This was not love, but anger, largely\nintermixed with scorn.  Yet the idea strangely forced itself upon me,\nthat there was a sort of familiarity between these two companions,\nnecessarily the result of an intimate love,--on Zenobia's part, at\nleast,--in days gone by, but which had prolonged itself into as\nintimate a hatred, for all futurity.  As they passed among the trees,\nreckless as her movement was, she took good heed that even the hem of\nher garment should not brush against the stranger's person.  I wondered\nwhether there had always been a chasm, guarded so religiously, betwixt\nthese two.\n\nAs for Westervelt, he was not a whit more warmed by Zenobia's passion\nthan a salamander by the heat of its native furnace.  He would have\nbeen absolutely statuesque, save for a look of slight perplexity,\ntinctured strongly with derision.  It was a crisis in which his\nintellectual perceptions could not altogether help him out.  He failed\nto comprehend, and cared but little for comprehending, why Zenobia\nshould put herself into such a fume; but satisfied his mind that it was\nall folly, and only another shape of a woman's manifold absurdity,\nwhich men can never understand.  How many a woman's evil fate has yoked\nher with a man like this!  Nature thrusts some of us into the world\nmiserably incomplete on the emotional side, with hardly any\nsensibilities except what pertain to us as animals.  No passion, save\nof the senses; no holy tenderness, nor the delicacy that results from\nthis.  Externally they bear a close resemblance to other men, and have\nperhaps all save the finest grace; but when a woman wrecks herself on\nsuch a being, she ultimately finds that the real womanhood within her\nhas no corresponding part in him.  Her deepest voice lacks a response;\nthe deeper her cry, the more dead his silence.  The fault may be none\nof his; he cannot give her what never lived within his soul.  But the\nwretchedness on her side, and the moral deterioration attendant on a\nfalse and shallow life, without strength enough to keep itself sweet,\nare among the most pitiable wrongs that mortals suffer.\n\nNow, as I looked down from my upper region at this man and\nwoman,--outwardly so fair a sight, and wandering like two lovers in the\nwood,--I imagined that Zenobia, at an earlier period of youth, might\nhave fallen into the misfortune above indicated.  And when her\npassionate womanhood, as was inevitable, had discovered its mistake,\nhere had ensued the character of eccentricity and defiance which\ndistinguished the more public portion of her life.\n\nSeeing how aptly matters had chanced thus far, I began to think it the\ndesign of fate to let me into all Zenobia's secrets, and that therefore\nthe couple would sit down beneath my tree, and carry on a conversation\nwhich would leave me nothing to inquire.  No doubt, however, had it so\nhappened, I should have deemed myself honorably bound to warn them of a\nlistener's presence by flinging down a handful of unripe grapes, or by\nsending an unearthly groan out of my hiding-place, as if this were one\nof the trees of Dante's ghostly forest.  But real life never arranges\nitself exactly like a romance. In the first place, they did not sit\ndown at all.  Secondly, even while they passed beneath the tree,\nZenobia's utterance was so hasty and broken, and Westervelt's so cool\nand low, that I hardly could make out an intelligible sentence on\neither side.  What I seem to remember, I yet suspect, may have been\npatched together by my fancy, in brooding over the matter afterwards.\n\n\"Why not fling the girl off,\" said Westervelt, \"and let her go?\"\n\n\"She clung to me from the first,\" replied Zenobia.  \"I neither know nor\ncare what it is in me that so attaches her.  But she loves me, and I\nwill not fail her.\"\n\n\"She will plague you, then,\" said he, \"in more ways than one.\"\n\n\"The poor child!\" exclaimed Zenobia.  \"She can do me neither good nor\nharm.  How should she?\"\n\nI know not what reply Westervelt whispered; nor did Zenobia's\nsubsequent exclamation give me any clew, except that it evidently\ninspired her with horror and disgust.\n\n\"With what kind of a being am I linked?\" cried she.  \"If my Creator\ncares aught for my soul, let him release me from this miserable bond!\"\n\n\"I did not think it weighed so heavily,\" said her companion..\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" answered Zenobia, \"it will strangle me at last!\"\n\nAnd then I heard her utter a helpless sort of moan; a sound which,\nstruggling out of the heart of a person of her pride and strength,\naffected me more than if she had made the wood dolorously vocal with a\nthousand shrieks and wails.\n\nOther mysterious words, besides what are above written, they spoke\ntogether; but I understood no more, and even question whether I fairly\nunderstood so much as this.  By long brooding over our recollections,\nwe subtilize them into something akin to imaginary stuff, and hardly\ncapable of being distinguished from it.  In a few moments they were\ncompletely beyond ear-shot.  A breeze stirred after them, and awoke the\nleafy tongues of the surrounding trees, which forthwith began to\nbabble, as if innumerable gossips had all at once got wind of Zenobia's\nsecret.  But, as the breeze grew stronger, its voice among the branches\nwas as if it said, \"Hush!  Hush!\" and I resolved that to no mortal\nwould I disclose what I had heard.  And, though there might be room for\ncasuistry, such, I conceive, is the most equitable rule in all similar\nconjunctures.\n\n\n\nXIII. ZENOBIA'S LEGEND\n\nThe illustrious Society of Blithedale, though it toiled in downright\nearnest for the good of mankind, yet not unfrequently illuminated its\nlaborious life with an afternoon or evening of pastime.  Picnics under\nthe trees were considerably in vogue; and, within doors, fragmentary\nbits of theatrical performance, such as single acts of tragedy or\ncomedy, or dramatic proverbs and charades.  Zenobia, besides, was fond\nof giving us readings from Shakespeare, and often with a depth of\ntragic power, or breadth of comic effect, that made one feel it an\nintolerable wrong to the world that she did not at once go upon the\nstage.  Tableaux vivants were another of our occasional modes of\namusement, in which scarlet shawls, old silken robes, ruffs, velvets,\nfurs, and all kinds of miscellaneous trumpery converted our familiar\ncompanions into the people of a pictorial world.  We had been thus\nengaged on the evening after the incident narrated in the last chapter.\nSeveral splendid works of art--either arranged after engravings from\nthe old masters, or original illustrations of scenes in history or\nromance--had been presented, and we were earnestly entreating Zenobia\nfor more.\n\nShe stood with a meditative air, holding a large piece of gauze, or\nsome such ethereal stuff, as if considering what picture should next\noccupy the frame; while at her feet lay a heap of many-colored\ngarments, which her quick fancy and magic skill could so easily convert\ninto gorgeous draperies for heroes and princesses.\n\n\"I am getting weary of this,\" said she, after a moment's thought. \"Our\nown features, and our own figures and airs, show a little too\nintrusively through all the characters we assume.  We have so much\nfamiliarity with one another's realities, that we cannot remove\nourselves, at pleasure, into an imaginary sphere.  Let us have no more\npictures to-night; but, to make you what poor amends I can, how would\nyou like to have me trump up a wild, spectral legend, on the spur of\nthe moment?\"\n\nZenobia had the gift of telling a fanciful little story, off-hand, in a\nway that made it greatly more effective than it was usually found to be\nwhen she afterwards elaborated the same production with her pen. Her\nproposal, therefore, was greeted with acclamation.\n\n\"Oh, a story, a story, by all means!\" cried the young girls.  \"No\nmatter how marvellous; we will believe it, every word.  And let it be a\nghost story, if you please.\"\n\n\"No, not exactly a ghost story,\" answered Zenobia; \"but something so\nnearly like it that you shall hardly tell the difference.  And,\nPriscilla, stand you before me, where I may look at you, and get my\ninspiration out of your eyes.  They are very deep and dreamy to-night.\"\n\nI know not whether the following version of her story will retain any\nportion of its pristine character; but, as Zenobia told it wildly and\nrapidly, hesitating at no extravagance, and dashing at absurdities\nwhich I am too timorous to repeat,--giving it the varied emphasis of\nher inimitable voice, and the pictorial illustration of her mobile\nface, while through it all we caught the freshest aroma of the\nthoughts, as they came bubbling out of her mind,--thus narrated, and\nthus heard, the legend seemed quite a remarkable affair.  I scarcely\nknew, at the time, whether she intended us to laugh or be more\nseriously impressed.  From beginning to end, it was undeniable\nnonsense, but not necessarily the worse for that.\n\n\n\nTHE SILVERY VEIL\n\nYou have heard, my dear friends, of the Veiled Lady, who grew suddenly\nso very famous, a few months ago.  And have you never thought how\nremarkable it was that this marvellous creature should vanish, all at\nonce, while her renown was on the increase, before the public had grown\nweary of her, and when the enigma of her character, instead of being\nsolved, presented itself more mystically at every exhibition?  Her last\nappearance, as you know, was before a crowded audience.  The next\nevening,--although the bills had announced her, at the corner of every\nstreet, in red letters of a gigantic size,--there was no Veiled Lady to\nbe seen!  Now, listen to my simple little tale, and you shall hear the\nvery latest incident in the known life--(if life it may be called,\nwhich seemed to have no more reality than the candle-light image of\none's self which peeps at us outside of a dark windowpane)--the life of\nthis shadowy phenomenon.\n\nA party of young gentlemen, you are to understand, were enjoying\nthemselves, one afternoon,--as young gentlemen are sometimes fond of\ndoing,--over a bottle or two of champagne; and, among other ladies less\nmysterious, the subject of the Veiled Lady, as was very natural,\nhappened to come up before them for discussion.  She rose, as it were,\nwith the sparkling effervescence of their wine, and appeared in a more\nairy and fantastic light on account of the medium through which they\nsaw her.  They repeated to one another, between jest and earnest, all\nthe wild stories that were in vogue; nor, I presume, did they hesitate\nto add any small circumstance that the inventive whim of the moment\nmight suggest, to heighten the marvellousness of their theme.\n\n\"But what an audacious report was that,\" observed one, \"which pretended\nto assert the identity of this strange creature with a young\nlady,\"--and here he mentioned her name,--\"the daughter of one of our\nmost distinguished families!\"\n\n\"Ah, there is more in that story than can well be accounted for,\"\nremarked another.  \"I have it on good authority, that the young lady in\nquestion is invariably out of sight, and not to be traced, even by her\nown family, at the hours when the Veiled Lady is before the public; nor\ncan any satisfactory explanation be given of her disappearance.  And\njust look at the thing: Her brother is a young fellow of spirit.  He\ncannot but be aware of these rumors in reference to his sister.  Why,\nthen, does he not come forward to defend her character, unless he is\nconscious that an investigation would only make the matter worse?\"\n\nIt is essential to the purposes of my legend to distinguish one of\nthese young gentlemen from his companions; so, for the sake of a soft\nand pretty name (such as we of the literary sisterhood invariably\nbestow upon our heroes), I deem it fit to call him Theodore.\n\n\"Pshaw!\" exclaimed Theodore; \"her brother is no such fool!  Nobody,\nunless his brain be as full of bubbles as this wine, can seriously\nthink of crediting that ridiculous rumor.  Why, if my senses did not\nplay me false (which never was the case yet), I affirm that I saw that\nvery lady, last evening, at the exhibition, while this veiled\nphenomenon was playing off her juggling tricks!  What can you say to\nthat?\"\n\n\"Oh, it was a spectral illusion that you saw!\" replied his friends,\nwith a general laugh.  \"The Veiled Lady is quite up to such a thing.\"\n\nHowever, as the above-mentioned fable could not hold its ground against\nTheodore's downright refutation, they went on to speak of other stories\nwhich the wild babble of the town had set afloat.  Some upheld that the\nveil covered the most beautiful countenance in the world; others,--and\ncertainly with more reason, considering the sex of the Veiled\nLady,--that the face was the most hideous and horrible, and that this\nwas her sole motive for hiding it.  It was the face of a corpse; it was\nthe head of a skeleton; it was a monstrous visage, with snaky locks,\nlike Medusa's, and one great red eye in the centre of the forehead.\nAgain, it was affirmed that there was no single and unchangeable set of\nfeatures beneath the veil; but that whosoever should be bold enough to\nlift it would behold the features of that person, in all the world, who\nwas destined to be his fate; perhaps he would be greeted by the tender\nsmile of the woman whom he loved, or, quite as probably, the deadly\nscowl of his bitterest enemy would throw a blight over his life.  They\nquoted, moreover, this startling explanation of the whole affair: that\nthe magician who exhibited the Veiled Lady--and who, by the bye, was\nthe handsomest man in the whole world--had bartered his own soul for\nseven years' possession of a familiar fiend, and that the last year of\nthe contract was wearing towards its close.\n\nIf it were worth our while, I could keep you till an hour beyond\nmidnight listening to a thousand such absurdities as these.  But\nfinally our friend Theodore, who prided himself upon his common-sense,\nfound the matter getting quite beyond his patience.\n\n\"I offer any wager you like,\" cried he, setting down his glass so\nforcibly as to break the stem of it, \"that this very evening I find out\nthe mystery of the Veiled Lady!\"\n\nYoung men, I am told, boggle at nothing over their wine; so, after a\nlittle more talk, a wager of considerable amount was actually laid, the\nmoney staked, and Theodore left to choose his own method of settling\nthe dispute.\n\nHow he managed it I know not, nor is it of any great importance to this\nveracious legend.  The most natural way, to be sure, was by bribing the\ndoorkeeper,--or possibly he preferred clambering in at the window.\nBut, at any rate, that very evening, while the exhibition was going\nforward in the hall, Theodore contrived to gain admittance into the\nprivate withdrawing-room whither the Veiled Lady was accustomed to\nretire at the close of her performances.  There he waited, listening, I\nsuppose, to the stifled hum of the great audience; and no doubt he\ncould distinguish the deep tones of the magician, causing the wonders\nthat he wrought to appear more dark and intricate, by his mystic\npretence of an explanation.  Perhaps, too, in the intervals of the wild\nbreezy music which accompanied the exhibition, he might hear the low\nvoice of the Veiled Lady, conveying her sibylline responses.  Firm as\nTheodore's nerves might be, and much as he prided himself on his sturdy\nperception of realities, I should not be surprised if his heart\nthrobbed at a little more than its ordinary rate.\n\nTheodore concealed himself behind a screen.  In due time the\nperformance was brought to a close, and whether the door was softly\nopened, or whether her bodiless presence came through the wall, is more\nthan I can say, but, all at once, without the young man's knowing how\nit happened, a veiled figure stood in the centre of the room.  It was\none thing to be in presence of this mystery in the hall of exhibition,\nwhere the warm, dense life of hundreds of other mortals kept up the\nbeholder's courage, and distributed her influence among so many; it was\nanother thing to be quite alone with her, and that, too, with a\nhostile, or, at least, an unauthorized and unjustifiable purpose.  I\nfurther imagine that Theodore now began to be sensible of something\nmore serious in his enterprise than he had been quite aware of while he\nsat with his boon-companions over their sparkling wine.\n\nVery strange, it must be confessed, was the movement with which the\nfigure floated to and fro over the carpet, with the silvery veil\ncovering her from head to foot; so impalpable, so ethereal, so without\nsubstance, as the texture seemed, yet hiding her every outline in an\nimpenetrability like that of midnight.  Surely, she did not walk!  She\nfloated, and flitted, and hovered about the room; no sound of a\nfootstep, no perceptible motion of a limb; it was as if a wandering\nbreeze wafted her before it, at its own wild and gentle pleasure.  But,\nby and by, a purpose began to be discernible, throughout the seeming\nvagueness of her unrest.  She was in quest of something.  Could it be\nthat a subtile presentiment had informed her of the young man's\npresence?  And if so, did the Veiled Lady seek or did she shun him?\nThe doubt in Theodore's mind was speedily resolved; for, after a moment\nor two of these erratic flutterings, she advanced more decidedly, and\nstood motionless before the screen.\n\n\"Thou art here!\" said a soft, low voice.  \"Come forth, Theodore!\" Thus\nsummoned by his name, Theodore, as a man of courage, had no choice.  He\nemerged from his concealment, and presented himself before the Veiled\nLady, with the wine-flush, it may be, quite gone out of his cheeks.\n\n\"What wouldst thou with me?\" she inquired, with the same gentle\ncomposure that was in her former utterance.\n\n\"Mysterious creature,\" replied Theodore, \"I would know who and what you\nare!\"\n\n\"My lips are forbidden to betray the secret,\" said the Veiled Lady.\n\n\"At whatever risk, I must discover it,\" rejoined Theodore.\n\n\"Then,\" said the Mystery, \"there is no way save to lift my veil.\"\n\nAnd Theodore, partly recovering his audacity, stept forward on the\ninstant, to do as the Veiled Lady had suggested.  But she floated\nbackward to the opposite side of the room, as if the young man's breath\nhad possessed power enough to waft her away.\n\n\"Pause, one little instant,\" said the soft, low voice, \"and learn the\nconditions of what thou art so bold to undertake.  Thou canst go hence,\nand think of me no more; or, at thy option, thou canst lift this\nmysterious veil, beneath which I am a sad and lonely prisoner, in a\nbondage which is worse to me than death.  But, before raising it, I\nentreat thee, in all maiden modesty, to bend forward and impress a kiss\nwhere my breath stirs the veil; and my virgin lips shall come forward\nto meet thy lips; and from that instant, Theodore, thou shalt be mine,\nand I thine, with never more a veil between us.  And all the felicity\nof earth and of the future world shall be thine and mine together.  So\nmuch may a maiden say behind the veil.  If thou shrinkest from this,\nthere is yet another way.\"  \"And what is that?\" asked Theodore.  \"Dost\nthou hesitate,\" said the Veiled Lady, \"to pledge thyself to me, by\nmeeting these lips of mine, while the veil yet hides my face?  Has not\nthy heart recognized me?  Dost thou come hither, not in holy faith, nor\nwith a pure and generous purpose, but in scornful scepticism and idle\ncuriosity?  Still, thou mayest lift the veil!  But, from that instant,\nTheodore, I am doomed to be thy evil fate; nor wilt thou ever taste\nanother breath of happiness!\"\n\nThere was a shade of inexpressible sadness in the utterance of these\nlast words.  But Theodore, whose natural tendency was towards\nscepticism, felt himself almost injured and insulted by the Veiled\nLady's proposal that he should pledge himself, for life and eternity,\nto so questionable a creature as herself; or even that she should\nsuggest an inconsequential kiss, taking into view the probability that\nher face was none of the most bewitching.  A delightful idea, truly,\nthat he should salute the lips of a dead girl, or the jaws of a\nskeleton, or the grinning cavity of a monster's mouth!  Even should she\nprove a comely maiden enough in other respects, the odds were ten to\none that her teeth were defective; a terrible drawback on the\ndelectableness of a kiss.\n\n\"Excuse me, fair lady,\" said Theodore, and I think he nearly burst into\na laugh, \"if I prefer to lift the veil first; and for this affair of\nthe kiss, we may decide upon it afterwards.\"\n\n\"Thou hast made thy choice,\" said the sweet, sad voice behind the veil;\nand there seemed a tender but unresentful sense of wrong done to\nwomanhood by the young man's contemptuous interpretation of her offer.\n\"I must not counsel thee to pause, although thy fate is still in thine\nown hand!\"\n\nGrasping at the veil, he flung it upward, and caught a glimpse of a\npale, lovely face beneath; just one momentary glimpse, and then the\napparition vanished, and the silvery veil fluttered slowly down and lay\nupon the floor.  Theodore was alone.  Our legend leaves him there. His\nretribution was, to pine forever and ever for another sight of that\ndim, mournful face,--which might have been his life-long household\nfireside joy,--to desire, and waste life in a feverish quest, and never\nmeet it more.\n\nBut what, in good sooth, had become of the Veiled Lady?  Had all her\nexistence been comprehended within that mysterious veil, and was she\nnow annihilated?  Or was she a spirit, with a heavenly essence, but\nwhich might have been tamed down to human bliss, had Theodore been\nbrave and true enough to claim her?  Hearken, my sweet friends,--and\nhearken, dear Priscilla,--and you shall learn the little more that\nZenobia can tell you.\n\nJust at the moment, so far as can be ascertained, when the Veiled Lady\nvanished, a maiden, pale and shadowy, rose up amid a knot of visionary\npeople, who were seeking for the better life.  She was so gentle and so\nsad,--a nameless melancholy gave her such hold upon their\nsympathies,--that they never thought of questioning whence she came.\nShe might have heretofore existed, or her thin substance might have\nbeen moulded out of air at the very instant when they first beheld her.\nIt was all one to them; they took her to their hearts. Among them was a\nlady to whom, more than to all the rest, this pale, mysterious girl\nattached herself.\n\nBut one morning the lady was wandering in the woods, and there met her\na figure in an Oriental robe, with a dark beard, and holding in his\nhand a silvery veil.  He motioned her to stay.  Being a woman of some\nnerve, she did not shriek, nor run away, nor faint, as many ladies\nwould have been apt to do, but stood quietly, and bade him speak.  The\ntruth was, she had seen his face before, but had never feared it,\nalthough she knew him to be a terrible magician.\n\n\"Lady,\" said he, with a warning gesture, \"you are in peril!\"  \"Peril!\"\nshe exclaimed.  \"And of what nature?\"\n\n\"There is a certain maiden,\" replied the magician, \"who has come out of\nthe realm of mystery, and made herself your most intimate companion.\nNow, the fates have so ordained it, that, whether by her own will or\nno, this stranger is your deadliest enemy.  In love, in worldly\nfortune, in all your pursuit of happiness, she is doomed to fling a\nblight over your prospects.  There is but one possibility of thwarting\nher disastrous influence.\"\n\n\"Then tell me that one method,\" said the lady.\n\n\"Take this veil,\" he answered, holding forth the silvery texture. \"It\nis a spell; it is a powerful enchantment, which I wrought for her sake,\nand beneath which she was once my prisoner.  Throw it, at unawares,\nover the head of this secret foe, stamp your foot, and cry, 'Arise,\nMagician!  Here is the Veiled Lady!' and immediately I will rise up\nthrough the earth, and seize her; and from that moment you are safe!\"\n\nSo the lady took the silvery veil, which was like woven air, or like\nsome substance airier than nothing, and that would float upward and be\nlost among the clouds, were she once to let it go.  Returning homeward,\nshe found the shadowy girl amid the knot of visionary\ntranscendentalists, who were still seeking for the better life.  She\nwas joyous now, and had a rose-bloom in her cheeks, and was one of the\nprettiest creatures, and seemed one of the happiest, that the world\ncould show.  But the lady stole noiselessly behind her and threw the\nveil over her head.  As the slight, ethereal texture sank inevitably\ndown over her figure, the poor girl strove to raise it, and met her\ndear friend's eyes with one glance of mortal terror, and deep, deep\nreproach.  It could not change her purpose.\n\n\"Arise, Magician!\" she exclaimed, stamping her foot upon the earth.\n\"Here is the Veiled Lady!\"\n\nAt the word, up rose the bearded man in the Oriental robes,--the\nbeautiful, the dark magician, who had bartered away his soul!  He threw\nhis arms around the Veiled Lady, and she was his bond-slave for\nevermore!\n\n\nZenobia, all this while, had been holding the piece of gauze, and so\nmanaged it as greatly to increase the dramatic effect of the legend at\nthose points where the magic veil was to be described.  Arriving at the\ncatastrophe, and uttering the fatal words, she flung the gauze over\nPriscilla's head; and for an instant her auditors held their breath,\nhalf expecting, I verily believe, that the magician would start up\nthrough the floor, and carry off our poor little friend before our eyes.\n\nAs for Priscilla, she stood droopingly in the midst of us, making no\nattempt to remove the veil.\n\n\"How do you find yourself, my love?\" said Zenobia, lifting a corner of\nthe gauze, and peeping beneath it with a mischievous smile.  \"Ah, the\ndear little soul!  Why, she is really going to faint!  Mr. Coverdale,\nMr. Coverdale, pray bring a glass of water!\"\n\nHer nerves being none of the strongest, Priscilla hardly recovered her\nequanimity during the rest of the evening.  This, to be sure, was a\ngreat pity; but, nevertheless, we thought it a very bright idea of\nZenobia's to bring her legend to so effective a conclusion.\n\n\n\nXIV. ELIOT'S PULPIT\n\nOur Sundays at Blithedale were not ordinarily kept with such rigid\nobservance as might have befitted the descendants of the Pilgrims,\nwhose high enterprise, as we sometimes flattered ourselves, we had\ntaken up, and were carrying it onward and aloft, to a point which they\nnever dreamed of attaining.\n\nOn that hallowed day, it is true, we rested from our labors.  Our oxen,\nrelieved from their week-day yoke, roamed at large through the pasture;\neach yoke-fellow, however, keeping close beside his mate, and\ncontinuing to acknowledge, from the force of habit and sluggish\nsympathy, the union which the taskmaster had imposed for his own hard\nends.  As for us human yoke-fellows, chosen companions of toil, whose\nhoes had clinked together throughout the week, we wandered off, in\nvarious directions, to enjoy our interval of repose.  Some, I believe,\nwent devoutly to the village church.  Others, it may be, ascended a\ncity or a country pulpit, wearing the clerical robe with so much\ndignity that you would scarcely have suspected the yeoman's frock to\nhave been flung off only since milking-time.  Others took long rambles\namong the rustic lanes and by-paths, pausing to look at black old\nfarmhouses, with their sloping roofs; and at the modern cottage, so\nlike a plaything that it seemed as if real joy or sorrow could have no\nscope within; and at the more pretending villa, with its range of\nwooden columns supporting the needless insolence of a great portico.\nSome betook themselves into the wide, dusky barn, and lay there for\nhours together on the odorous hay; while the sunstreaks and the shadows\nstrove together,--these to make the barn solemn, those to make it\ncheerful,--and both were conquerors; and the swallows twittered a\ncheery anthem, flashing into sight, or vanishing as they darted to and\nfro among the golden rules of sunshine.  And others went a little way\ninto the woods, and threw themselves on mother earth, pillowing their\nheads on a heap of moss, the green decay of an old log; and, dropping\nasleep, the bumblebees and mosquitoes sung and buzzed about their ears,\ncausing the slumberers to twitch and start, without awaking.\n\nWith Hollingsworth, Zenobia, Priscilla, and myself, it grew to be a\ncustom to spend the Sabbath afternoon at a certain rock.  It was known\nto us under the name of Eliot's pulpit, from a tradition that the\nvenerable Apostle Eliot had preached there, two centuries gone by, to\nan Indian auditory.  The old pine forest, through which the Apostle's\nvoice was wont to sound, had fallen an immemorial time ago. But the\nsoil, being of the rudest and most broken surface, had apparently never\nbeen brought under tillage; other growths, maple and beech and birch,\nhad succeeded to the primeval trees; so that it was still as wild a\ntract of woodland as the great-great-great-great grandson of one of\nEliot's Indians (had any such posterity been in existence) could have\ndesired for the site and shelter of his wigwam. These after-growths,\nindeed, lose the stately solemnity of the original forest.  If left in\ndue neglect, however, they run into an entanglement of softer wildness,\namong the rustling leaves of which the sun can scatter cheerfulness as\nit never could among the dark-browed pines.\n\nThe rock itself rose some twenty or thirty feet, a shattered granite\nbowlder, or heap of bowlders, with an irregular outline and many\nfissures, out of which sprang shrubs, bushes, and even trees; as if the\nscanty soil within those crevices were sweeter to their roots than any\nother earth.  At the base of the pulpit, the broken bowlders inclined\ntowards each other, so as to form a shallow cave, within which our\nlittle party had sometimes found protection from a summer shower.  On\nthe threshold, or just across it, grew a tuft of pale columbines, in\ntheir season, and violets, sad and shadowy recluses, such as Priscilla\nwas when we first knew her; children of the sun, who had never seen\ntheir father, but dwelt among damp mosses, though not akin to them.  At\nthe summit, the rock was overshadowed by the canopy of a birch-tree,\nwhich served as a sounding-board for the pulpit.  Beneath this shade\n(with my eyes of sense half shut and those of the imagination widely\nopened) I used to see the holy Apostle of the Indians, with the\nsunlight flickering down upon him through the leaves, and glorifying\nhis figure as with the half-perceptible glow of a transfiguration.\n\nI the more minutely describe the rock, and this little Sabbath\nsolitude, because Hollingsworth, at our solicitation, often ascended\nEliot's pulpit, and not exactly preached, but talked to us, his few\ndisciples, in a strain that rose and fell as naturally as the wind's\nbreath among the leaves of the birch-tree.  No other speech of man has\never moved me like some of those discourses.  It seemed most pitiful--a\npositive calamity to the world--that a treasury of golden thoughts\nshould thus be scattered, by the liberal handful, down among us three,\nwhen a thousand hearers might have been the richer for them; and\nHollingsworth the richer, likewise, by the sympathy of multitudes.\nAfter speaking much or little, as might happen, he would descend from\nhis gray pulpit, and generally fling himself at full length on the\nground, face downward.  Meanwhile, we talked around him on such topics\nas were suggested by the discourse.\n\nSince her interview with Westervelt, Zenobia's continual inequalities\nof temper had been rather difficult for her friends to bear.  On the\nfirst Sunday after that incident, when Hollingsworth had clambered down\nfrom Eliot's pulpit, she declaimed with great earnestness and passion,\nnothing short of anger, on the injustice which the world did to women,\nand equally to itself, by not allowing them, in freedom and honor, and\nwith the fullest welcome, their natural utterance in public.\n\n\"It shall not always be so!\" cried she.  \"If I live another year, I\nwill lift up my own voice in behalf of woman's wider liberty!\"\n\nShe perhaps saw me smile.\n\n\"What matter of ridicule do you find in this, Miles Coverdale?\"\nexclaimed Zenobia, with a flash of anger in her eyes.  \"That smile,\npermit me to say, makes me suspicious of a low tone of feeling and\nshallow thought.  It is my belief--yes, and my prophecy, should I die\nbefore it happens--that, when my sex shall achieve its rights, there\nwill be ten eloquent women where there is now one eloquent man.  Thus\nfar, no woman in the world has ever once spoken out her whole heart and\nher whole mind.  The mistrust and disapproval of the vast bulk of\nsociety throttles us, as with two gigantic hands at our throats!  We\nmumble a few weak words, and leave a thousand better ones unsaid. You\nlet us write a little, it is true, on a limited range of subjects. But\nthe pen is not for woman.  Her power is too natural and immediate.  It\nis with the living voice alone that she can compel the world to\nrecognize the light of her intellect and the depth of her heart!\"\n\nNow,--though I could not well say so to Zenobia,--I had not smiled from\nany unworthy estimate of woman, or in denial of the claims which she is\nbeginning to put forth.  What amused and puzzled me was the fact, that\nwomen, however intellectually superior, so seldom disquiet themselves\nabout the rights or wrongs of their sex, unless their own individual\naffections chance to lie in idleness, or to be ill at ease. They are\nnot natural reformers, but become such by the pressure of exceptional\nmisfortune.  I could measure Zenobia's inward trouble by the animosity\nwith which she now took up the general quarrel of woman against man.\n\n\"I will give you leave, Zenobia,\" replied I, \"to fling your utmost\nscorn upon me, if you ever hear me utter a sentiment unfavorable to the\nwidest liberty which woman has yet dreamed of.  I would give her all\nshe asks, and add a great deal more, which she will not be the party to\ndemand, but which men, if they were generous and wise, would grant of\ntheir own free motion.  For instance, I should love dearly--for the\nnext thousand years, at least--to have all government devolve into the\nhands of women.  I hate to be ruled by my own sex; it excites my\njealousy, and wounds my pride.  It is the iron sway of bodily force\nwhich abases us, in our compelled submission.  But how sweet the free,\ngenerous courtesy with which I would kneel before a woman-ruler!\"\n\n\"Yes, if she were young and beautiful,\" said Zenobia, laughing.  \"But\nhow if she were sixty, and a fright?\"\n\n\"Ah! it is you that rate womanhood low,\" said I. \"But let me go on. I\nhave never found it possible to suffer a bearded priest so near my\nheart and conscience as to do me any spiritual good.  I blush at the\nvery thought!  Oh, in the better order of things, Heaven grant that the\nministry of souls may be left in charge of women!  The gates of the\nBlessed City will be thronged with the multitude that enter in, when\nthat day comes!  The task belongs to woman.  God meant it for her.  He\nhas endowed her with the religious sentiment in its utmost depth and\npurity, refined from that gross, intellectual alloy with which every\nmasculine theologist--save only One, who merely veiled himself in\nmortal and masculine shape, but was, in truth, divine--has been prone\nto mingle it.  I have always envied the Catholics their faith in that\nsweet, sacred Virgin Mother, who stands between them and the Deity,\nintercepting somewhat of his awful splendor, but permitting his love to\nstream upon the worshipper more intelligibly to human comprehension\nthrough the medium of a woman's tenderness. Have I not said enough,\nZenobia?\"\n\n\"I cannot think that this is true,\" observed Priscilla, who had been\ngazing at me with great, disapproving eyes.  \"And I am sure I do not\nwish it to be true!\"\n\n\"Poor child!\" exclaimed Zenobia, rather contemptuously.  \"She is the\ntype of womanhood, such as man has spent centuries in making it.  He is\nnever content unless he can degrade himself by stooping towards what he\nloves.  In denying us our rights, he betrays even more blindness to his\nown interests than profligate disregard of ours!\"\n\n\"Is this true?\" asked Priscilla with simplicity, turning to\nHollingsworth.  \"Is it all true, that Mr. Coverdale and Zenobia have\nbeen saying?\"\n\n\"No, Priscilla!\" answered Hollingsworth with his customary bluntness.\n\"They have neither of them spoken one true word yet.\"\n\n\"Do you despise woman?\" said Zenobia.\n\n\"Ah, Hollingsworth, that would be most ungrateful!\"\n\n\"Despise her?  No!\" cried Hollingsworth, lifting his great shaggy head\nand shaking it at us, while his eyes glowed almost fiercely. \"She is\nthe most admirable handiwork of God, in her true place and character.\nHer place is at man's side.  Her office, that of the sympathizer; the\nunreserved, unquestioning believer; the recognition, withheld in every\nother manner, but given, in pity, through woman's heart, lest man\nshould utterly lose faith in himself; the echo of God's own voice,\npronouncing, 'It is well done!' All the separate action of woman is,\nand ever has been, and always shall be, false, foolish, vain,\ndestructive of her own best and holiest qualities, void of every good\neffect, and productive of intolerable mischiefs! Man is a wretch\nwithout woman; but woman is a monster--and, thank Heaven, an almost\nimpossible and hitherto imaginary monster--without man as her\nacknowledged principal!  As true as I had once a mother whom I loved,\nwere there any possible prospect of woman's taking the social stand\nwhich some of them,--poor, miserable, abortive creatures, who only\ndream of such things because they have missed woman's peculiar\nhappiness, or because nature made them really neither man nor\nwoman!--if there were a chance of their attaining the end which these\npetticoated monstrosities have in view, I would call upon my own sex to\nuse its physical force, that unmistakable evidence of sovereignty, to\nscourge them back within their proper bounds!  But it will not be\nneedful.  The heart of time womanhood knows where its own sphere is,\nand never seeks to stray beyond it!\"\n\nNever was mortal blessed--if blessing it were--with a glance of such\nentire acquiescence and unquestioning faith, happy in its completeness,\nas our little Priscilla unconsciously bestowed on Hollingsworth.  She\nseemed to take the sentiment from his lips into her heart, and brood\nover it in perfect content.  The very woman whom he pictured--the\ngentle parasite, the soft reflection of a more powerful existence--sat\nthere at his feet.\n\nI looked at Zenobia, however, fully expecting her to resent--as I felt,\nby the indignant ebullition of my own blood, that she ought this\noutrageous affirmation of what struck me as the intensity of masculine\negotism.  It centred everything in itself, and deprived woman of her\nvery soul, her inexpressible and unfathomable all, to make it a mere\nincident in the great sum of man.  Hollingsworth had boldly uttered\nwhat he, and millions of despots like him, really felt. Without\nintending it, he had disclosed the wellspring of all these troubled\nwaters.  Now, if ever, it surely behooved Zenobia to be the champion of\nher sex.\n\nBut, to my surprise, and indignation too, she only looked humbled. Some\ntears sparkled in her eyes, but they were wholly of grief, not anger.\n\n\"Well, be it so,\" was all she said.  \"I, at least, have deep cause to\nthink you right.  Let man be but manly and godlike, and woman is only\ntoo ready to become to him what you say!\"\n\nI smiled--somewhat bitterly, it is true--in contemplation of my own\nill-luck.  How little did these two women care for me, who had freely\nconceded all their claims, and a great deal more, out of the fulness of\nmy heart; while Hollingsworth, by some necromancy of his horrible\ninjustice, seemed to have brought them both to his feet!\n\n\"Women almost invariably behave thus,\" thought I. \"What does the fact\nmean?  Is it their nature?  Or is it, at last, the result of ages of\ncompelled degradation?  And, in either case, will it be possible ever\nto redeem them?\"\n\nAn intuition now appeared to possess all the party, that, for this\ntime, at least, there was no more to be said.  With one accord, we\narose from the ground, and made our way through the tangled undergrowth\ntowards one of those pleasant wood-paths that wound among the\noverarching trees.  Some of the branches hung so low as partly to\nconceal the figures that went before from those who followed. Priscilla\nhad leaped up more lightly than the rest of us, and ran along in\nadvance, with as much airy activity of spirit as was typified in the\nmotion of a bird, which chanced to be flitting from tree to tree, in\nthe same direction as herself.  Never did she seem so happy as that\nafternoon.  She skipt, and could not help it, from very playfulness of\nheart.\n\nZenobia and Hollingsworth went next, in close contiguity, but not with\narm in arm.  Now, just when they had passed the impending bough of a\nbirch-tree, I plainly saw Zenobia take the hand of Hollingsworth in\nboth her own, press it to her bosom, and let it fall again!\n\nThe gesture was sudden, and full of passion; the impulse had evidently\ntaken her by surprise; it expressed all!  Had Zenobia knelt before him,\nor flung herself upon his breast, and gasped out, \"I love you,\nHollingsworth!\"  I could not have been more certain of what it meant.\nThey then walked onward, as before.  But, methought, as the declining\nsun threw Zenobia's magnified shadow along the path, I beheld it\ntremulous; and the delicate stem of the flower which she wore in her\nhair was likewise responsive to her agitation.\n\nPriscilla--through the medium of her eyes, at least could not possibly\nhave been aware of the gesture above described.  Yet, at that instant,\nI saw her droop.  The buoyancy, which just before had been so\nbird-like, was utterly departed; the life seemed to pass out of her,\nand even the substance of her figure to grow thin and gray. I almost\nimagined her a shadow, tiding gradually into the dimness of the wood.\nHer pace became so slow that Hollingsworth and Zenobia passed by, and\nI, without hastening my footsteps, overtook her.\n\n\"Come, Priscilla,\" said I, looking her intently in the face, which was\nvery pale and sorrowful, \"we must make haste after our friends. Do you\nfeel suddenly ill?  A moment ago, you flitted along so lightly that I\nwas comparing you to a bird.  Now, on the contrary, it is as if you had\na heavy heart, and a very little strength to bear it with. Pray take my\narm!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Priscilla, \"I do not think it would help me.  It is my\nheart, as you say, that makes me heavy; and I know not why.  Just now,\nI felt very happy.\"\n\nNo doubt it was a kind of sacrilege in me to attempt to come within her\nmaidenly mystery; but, as she appeared to be tossed aside by her other\nfriends, or carelessly let fall, like a flower which they had done\nwith, I could not resist the impulse to take just one peep beneath her\nfolded petals.\n\n\"Zenobia and yourself are dear friends of late,\" I remarked.  \"At\nfirst,--that first evening when you came to us,--she did not receive\nyou quite so warmly as might have been wished.\"\n\n\"I remember it,\" said Priscilla.  \"No wonder she hesitated to love me,\nwho was then a stranger to her, and a girl of no grace or beauty,--she\nbeing herself so beautiful!\"\n\n\"But she loves you now, of course?\" suggested I. \"And at this very\ninstant you feel her to be your dearest friend?\"\n\n\"Why do you ask me that question?\" exclaimed Priscilla, as if\nfrightened at the scrutiny into her feelings which I compelled her to\nmake.  \"It somehow puts strange thoughts into my mind.  But I do love\nZenobia dearly!  If she only loves me half as well, I shall be happy!\"\n\n\"How is it possible to doubt that, Priscilla?\"  I rejoined.  \"But\nobserve how pleasantly and happily Zenobia and Hollingsworth are\nwalking together.  I call it a delightful spectacle.  It truly rejoices\nme that Hollingsworth has found so fit and affectionate a friend!  So\nmany people in the world mistrust him,--so many disbelieve and\nridicule, while hardly any do him justice, or acknowledge him for the\nwonderful man he is,--that it is really a blessed thing for him to have\nwon the sympathy of such a woman as Zenobia.  Any man might be proud of\nthat.  Any man, even if he be as great as Hollingsworth, might love so\nmagnificent a woman.  How very beautiful Zenobia is!  And Hollingsworth\nknows it, too.\"\n\nThere may have been some petty malice in what I said.  Generosity is a\nvery fine thing, at a proper time and within due limits.  But it is an\ninsufferable bore to see one man engrossing every thought of all the\nwomen, and leaving his friend to shiver in outer seclusion, without\neven the alternative of solacing himself with what the more fortunate\nindividual has rejected.  Yes, it was out of a foolish bitterness of\nheart that I had spoken.\n\n\"Go on before,\" said Priscilla abruptly, and with true feminine\nimperiousness, which heretofore I had never seen her exercise.  \"It\npleases me best to loiter along by myself.  I do not walk so fast as\nyou.\"\n\nWith her hand she made a little gesture of dismissal.  It provoked me;\nyet, on the whole, was the most bewitching thing that Priscilla had\never done.  I obeyed her, and strolled moodily homeward, wondering--as\nI had wondered a thousand times already--how Hollingsworth meant to\ndispose of these two hearts, which (plainly to my perception, and, as I\ncould not but now suppose, to his) he had engrossed into his own huge\negotism.\n\nThere was likewise another subject hardly less fruitful of speculation.\nIn what attitude did Zenobia present herself to Hollingsworth?  Was it\nin that of a free woman, with no mortgage on her affections nor\nclaimant to her hand, but fully at liberty to surrender both, in\nexchange for the heart and hand which she apparently expected to\nreceive?  But was it a vision that I had witnessed in the wood?  Was\nWestervelt a goblin?  Were those words of passion and agony, which\nZenobia had uttered in my hearing, a mere stage declamation?  Were they\nformed of a material lighter than common air?  Or, supposing them to\nbear sterling weight, was it a perilous and dreadful wrong which she\nwas meditating towards herself and Hollingsworth?\n\nArriving nearly at the farmhouse, I looked back over the long slope of\npasture land, and beheld them standing together, in the light of\nsunset, just on the spot where, according to the gossip of the\nCommunity, they meant to build their cottage.  Priscilla, alone and\nforgotten, was lingering in the shadow of the wood.\n\n\n\nXV. A CRISIS\n\nThus the summer was passing away,--a summer of toil, of interest, of\nsomething that was not pleasure, but which went deep into my heart, and\nthere became a rich experience.  I found myself looking forward to\nyears, if not to a lifetime, to be spent on the same system.  The\nCommunity were now beginning to form their permanent plans.  One of our\npurposes was to erect a Phalanstery (as I think we called it, after\nFourier; but the phraseology of those days is not very fresh in my\nremembrance), where the great and general family should have its\nabiding-place.  Individual members, too, who made it a point of\nreligion to preserve the sanctity of an exclusive home, were selecting\nsites for their cottages, by the wood-side, or on the breezy swells, or\nin the sheltered nook of some little valley, according as their taste\nmight lean towards snugness or the picturesque.  Altogether, by\nprojecting our minds outward, we had imparted a show of novelty to\nexistence, and contemplated it as hopefully as if the soil beneath our\nfeet had not been fathom-deep with the dust of deluded generations, on\nevery one of which, as on ourselves, the world had imposed itself as a\nhitherto unwedded bride.\n\nHollingsworth and myself had often discussed these prospects.  It was\neasy to perceive, however, that he spoke with little or no fervor, but\neither as questioning the fulfilment of our anticipations, or, at any\nrate, with a quiet consciousness that it was no personal concern of\nhis.  Shortly after the scene at Eliot's pulpit, while he and I were\nrepairing an old stone fence, I amused myself with sallying forward\ninto the future time.\n\n\"When we come to be old men,\" I said, \"they will call us uncles, or\nfathers,--Father Hollingsworth and Uncle Coverdale,--and we will look\nback cheerfully to these early days, and make a romantic story for the\nyoung People (and if a little more romantic than truth may warrant, it\nwill be no harm) out of our severe trials and hardships. In a century\nor two, we shall, every one of us, be mythical personages, or\nexceedingly picturesque and poetical ones, at all events.  They will\nhave a great public hall, in which your portrait, and mine, and twenty\nother faces that are living now, shall be hung up; and as for me, I\nwill be painted in my shirtsleeves, and with the sleeves rolled up, to\nshow my muscular development.  What stories will be rife among them\nabout our mighty strength!\" continued I, lifting a big stone and\nputting it into its place, \"though our posterity will really be far\nstronger than ourselves, after several generations of a simple,\nnatural, and active life.  What legends of Zenobia's beauty, and\nPriscilla's slender and shadowy grace, and those mysterious qualities\nwhich make her seem diaphanous with spiritual light!  In due course of\nages, we must all figure heroically in an epic poem; and we will\nourselves--at least, I will--bend unseen over the future poet, and lend\nhim inspiration while he writes it.\"\n\n\"You seem,\" said Hollingsworth, \"to be trying how much nonsense you can\npour out in a breath.\"\n\n\"I wish you would see fit to comprehend,\" retorted I, \"that the\nprofoundest wisdom must be mingled with nine tenths of nonsense, else\nit is not worth the breath that utters it.  But I do long for the\ncottages to be built, that the creeping plants may begin to run over\nthem, and the moss to gather on the walls, and the trees--which we will\nset out--to cover them with a breadth of shadow.  This spick-and-span\nnovelty does not quite suit my taste.  It is time, too, for children to\nbe born among us.  The first-born child is still to come.  And I shall\nnever feel as if this were a real, practical, as well as poetical\nsystem of human life, until somebody has sanctified it by death.\"\n\n\"A pretty occasion for martyrdom, truly!\" said Hollingsworth.\n\n\"As good as any other,\" I replied.  \"I wonder, Hollingsworth, who, of\nall these strong men, and fair women and maidens, is doomed the first\nto die.  Would it not be well, even before we have absolute need of it,\nto fix upon a spot for a cemetery?  Let us choose the rudest, roughest,\nmost uncultivable spot, for Death's garden ground; and Death shall\nteach us to beautify it, grave by grave.  By our sweet, calm way of\ndying, and the airy elegance out of which we will shape our funeral\nrites, and the cheerful allegories which we will model into tombstones,\nthe final scene shall lose its terrors; so that hereafter it may be\nhappiness to live, and bliss to die.  None of us must die young.  Yet,\nshould Providence ordain it so, the event shall not be sorrowful, but\naffect us with a tender, delicious, only half-melancholy, and almost\nsmiling pathos!\"\n\n\"That is to say,\" muttered Hollingsworth, \"you will die like a heathen,\nas you certainly live like one.  But, listen to me, Coverdale.  Your\nfantastic anticipations make me discern all the more forcibly what a\nwretched, unsubstantial scheme is this, on which we have wasted a\nprecious summer of our lives.  Do you seriously imagine that any such\nrealities as you, and many others here, have dreamed of, will ever be\nbrought to pass?\"\n\n\"Certainly I do,\" said I. \"Of course, when the reality comes, it will\nwear the every-day, commonplace, dusty, and rather homely garb that\nreality always does put on.  But, setting aside the ideal charm, I hold\nthat our highest anticipations have a solid footing on common sense.\"\n\n\"You only half believe what you say,\" rejoined Hollingsworth; \"and as\nfor me, I neither have faith in your dream, nor would care the value of\nthis pebble for its realization, were that possible.  And what more do\nyou want of it?  It has given you a theme for poetry.  Let that content\nyou.  But now I ask you to be, at last, a man of sobriety and\nearnestness, and aid me in an enterprise which is worth all our\nstrength, and the strength of a thousand mightier than we.\"\n\nThere can be no need of giving in detail the conversation that ensued.\nIt is enough to say that Hollingsworth once more brought forward his\nrigid and unconquerable idea,--a scheme for the reformation of the\nwicked by methods moral, intellectual, and industrial, by the sympathy\nof pure, humble, and yet exalted minds, and by opening to his pupils\nthe possibility of a worthier life than that which had become their\nfate.  It appeared, unless he overestimated his own means, that\nHollingsworth held it at his choice (and he did so choose) to obtain\npossession of the very ground on which we had planted our Community,\nand which had not yet been made irrevocably ours, by purchase.  It was\njust the foundation that he desired.  Our beginnings might readily be\nadapted to his great end.  The arrangements already completed would\nwork quietly into his system. So plausible looked his theory, and, more\nthan that, so practical,--such an air of reasonableness had he, by\npatient thought, thrown over it,--each segment of it was contrived to\ndovetail into all the rest with such a complicated applicability, and\nso ready was he with a response for every objection, that, really, so\nfar as logic and argument went, he had the matter all his own way.\n\n\"But,\" said I, \"whence can you, having no means of your own, derive the\nenormous capital which is essential to this experiment?  State Street,\nI imagine, would not draw its purser strings very liberally in aid of\nsuch a speculation.\"\n\n\"I have the funds--as much, at least, as is needed for a\ncommencement--at command,\" he answered.  \"They can be produced within a\nmonth, if necessary.\"\n\nMy thoughts reverted to Zenobia.  It could only be her wealth which\nHollingsworth was appropriating so lavishly.  And on what conditions\nwas it to be had?  Did she fling it into the scheme with the\nuncalculating generosity that characterizes a woman when it is her\nimpulse to be generous at all?  And did she fling herself along with\nit?  But Hollingsworth did not volunteer an explanation.\n\n\"And have you no regrets,\" I inquired, \"in overthrowing this fair\nsystem of our new life, which has been planned so deeply, and is now\nbeginning to flourish so hopefully around us?  How beautiful it is,\nand, so far as we can yet see, how practicable!  The ages have waited\nfor us, and here we are, the very first that have essayed to carry on\nour mortal existence in love and mutual help!  Hollingsworth, I would\nbe loath to take the ruin of this enterprise upon my conscience.\"\n\n\"Then let it rest wholly upon mine!\" he answered, knitting his black\nbrows.  \"I see through the system.  It is full of\ndefects,--irremediable and damning ones!--from first to last, there is\nnothing else!  I grasp it in my hand, and find no substance whatever.\nThere is not human nature in it.\"\n\n\"Why are you so secret in your operations?\"  I asked.  \"God forbid that\nI should accuse you of intentional wrong; but the besetting sin of a\nphilanthropist, it appears to me, is apt to be a moral obliquity. His\nsense of honor ceases to be the sense of other honorable men. At some\npoint of his course--I know not exactly when or where--he is tempted to\npalter with the right, and can scarcely forbear persuading himself that\nthe importance of his public ends renders it allowable to throw aside\nhis private conscience.  Oh, my dear friend, beware this error!  If you\nmeditate the overthrow of this establishment, call together our\ncompanions, state your design, support it with all your eloquence, but\nallow them an opportunity of defending themselves.\"\n\n\"It does not suit me,\" said Hollingsworth.  \"Nor is it my duty to do\nso.\"\n\n\"I think it is,\" replied I.\n\nHollingsworth frowned; not in passion, but, like fate, inexorably.\n\n\"I will not argue the point,\" said he.  \"What I desire to know of you\nis,--and you can tell me in one word,--whether I am to look for your\ncooperation in this great scheme of good?  Take it up with me!  Be my\nbrother in it!  It offers you (what you have told me, over and over\nagain, that you most need) a purpose in life, worthy of the extremest\nself-devotion,--worthy of martyrdom, should God so order it!  In this\nview, I present it to you.  You can greatly benefit mankind.  Your\npeculiar faculties, as I shall direct them, are capable of being so\nwrought into this enterprise that not one of them need lie idle. Strike\nhands with me, and from this moment you shall never again feel the\nlanguor and vague wretchedness of an indolent or half-occupied man.\nThere may be no more aimless beauty in your life; but, in its stead,\nthere shall be strength, courage, immitigable will,--everything that a\nmanly and generous nature should desire!  We shall succeed!  We shall\nhave done our best for this miserable world; and happiness (which never\ncomes but incidentally) will come to us unawares.\"\n\nIt seemed his intention to say no more.  But, after he had quite broken\noff, his deep eyes filled with tears, and he held out both his hands to\nme.\n\n\"Coverdale,\" he murmured, \"there is not the man in this wide world whom\nI can love as I could you.  Do not forsake me!\"\n\nAs I look back upon this scene, through the coldness and dimness of so\nmany years, there is still a sensation as if Hollingsworth had caught\nhold of my heart, and were pulling it towards him with an almost\nirresistible force.  It is a mystery to me how I withstood it. But, in\ntruth, I saw in his scheme of philanthropy nothing but what was odious.\nA loathsomeness that was to be forever in my daily work! A great black\nugliness of sin, which he proposed to collect out of a thousand human\nhearts, and that we should spend our lives in an experiment of\ntransmuting it into virtue!  Had I but touched his extended hand,\nHollingsworth's magnetism would perhaps have penetrated me with his own\nconception of all these matters.  But I stood aloof.  I fortified\nmyself with doubts whether his strength of purpose had not been too\ngigantic for his integrity, impelling him to trample on considerations\nthat should have been paramount to every other.\n\n\"Is Zenobia to take a part in your enterprise?\"  I asked.\n\n\"She is,\" said Hollingsworth.\n\n\"She!--the beautiful!--the gorgeous!\"  I exclaimed.  \"And how have you\nprevailed with such a woman to work in this squalid element?\"\n\n\"Through no base methods, as you seem to suspect,\" he answered; \"but by\naddressing whatever is best and noblest in her.\"\n\nHollingsworth was looking on the ground.  But, as he often did\nso,--generally, indeed, in his habitual moods of thought,--I could not\njudge whether it was from any special unwillingness now to meet my\neyes.  What it was that dictated my next question, I cannot precisely\nsay.  Nevertheless, it rose so inevitably into my mouth, and, as it\nwere, asked itself so involuntarily, that there must needs have been an\naptness in it.\n\n\"What is to become of Priscilla?\"\n\nHollingsworth looked at me fiercely, and with glowing eyes.  He could\nnot have shown any other kind of expression than that, had he meant to\nstrike me with a sword.\n\n\"Why do you bring in the names of these women?\" said he, after a moment\nof pregnant silence.  \"What have they to do with the proposal which I\nmake you?  I must have your answer!  Will you devote yourself, and\nsacrifice all to this great end, and be my friend of friends forever?\"\n\n\"In Heaven's name, Hollingsworth,\" cried I, getting angry, and glad to\nbe angry, because so only was it possible to oppose his tremendous\nconcentrativeness and indomitable will, \"cannot you conceive that a man\nmay wish well to the world, and struggle for its good, on some other\nplan than precisely that which you have laid down?  And will you cast\noff a friend for no unworthiness, but merely because he stands upon his\nright as an individual being, and looks at matters through his own\noptics, instead of yours?\"\n\n\"Be with me,\" said Hollingsworth, \"or be against me!  There is no third\nchoice for you.\"\n\n\"Take this, then, as my decision,\" I answered.  \"I doubt the wisdom of\nyour scheme.  Furthermore, I greatly fear that the methods by which you\nallow yourself to pursue it are such as cannot stand the scrutiny of an\nunbiassed conscience.\"\n\n\"And you will not join me?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\nI never said the word--and certainly can never have it to say\nhereafter--that cost me a thousandth part so hard an effort as did that\none syllable.  The heart-pang was not merely figurative, but an\nabsolute torture of the breast.  I was gazing steadfastly at\nHollingsworth.  It seemed to me that it struck him, too, like a bullet.\nA ghastly paleness--always so terrific on a swarthy face--overspread\nhis features.  There was a convulsive movement of his throat, as if he\nwere forcing down some words that struggled and fought for utterance.\nWhether words of anger, or words of grief, I cannot tell; although many\nand many a time I have vainly tormented myself with conjecturing which\nof the two they were.  One other appeal to my friendship,--such as\nonce, already, Hollingsworth had made,--taking me in the revulsion that\nfollowed a strenuous exercise of opposing will, would completely have\nsubdued me.  But he left the matter there.  \"Well!\" said he.\n\nAnd that was all!  I should have been thankful for one word more, even\nhad it shot me through the heart, as mine did him.  But he did not\nspeak it; and, after a few moments, with one accord, we set to work\nagain, repairing the stone fence.  Hollingsworth, I observed, wrought\nlike a Titan; and, for my own part, I lifted stones which at this\nday--or, in a calmer mood, at that one--I should no more have thought\nit possible to stir than to carry off the gates of Gaza on my back.\n\n\n\nXVI. LEAVE-TAKINGS\n\nA few days after the tragic passage-at-arms between Hollingsworth and\nme, I appeared at the dinner-table actually dressed in a coat, instead\nof my customary blouse; with a satin cravat, too, a white vest, and\nseveral other things that made me seem strange and outlandish to\nmyself.  As for my companions, this unwonted spectacle caused a great\nstir upon the wooden benches that bordered either side of our homely\nboard.\n\n\"What's in the wind now, Miles?\" asked one of them.  \"Are you deserting\nus?\"\n\n\"Yes, for a week or two,\" said I. \"It strikes me that my health demands\na little relaxation of labor, and a short visit to the seaside, during\nthe dog-days.\"\n\n\"You look like it!\" grumbled Silas Foster, not greatly pleased with the\nidea of losing an efficient laborer before the stress of the season was\nwell over.  \"Now, here's a pretty fellow!  His shoulders have broadened\na matter of six inches since he came among us; he can do his day's\nwork, if he likes, with any man or ox on the farm; and yet he talks\nabout going to the seashore for his health!  Well, well, old woman,\"\nadded he to his wife, \"let me have a plateful of that pork and cabbage!\nI begin to feel in a very weakly way.  When the others have had their\nturn, you and I will take a jaunt to Newport or Saratoga!\"\n\n\n\"Well, but, Mr. Foster,\" said I, \"you must allow me to take a little\nbreath.\"\n\n\"Breath!\" retorted the old yeoman.  \"Your lungs have the play of a pair\nof blacksmith's bellows already.  What on earth do you want more?  But\ngo along!  I understand the business.  We shall never see your face\nhere again.  Here ends the reformation of the world, so far as Miles\nCoverdale has a hand in it!\"\n\n\"By no means,\" I replied.  \"I am resolute to die in the last ditch, for\nthe good of the cause.\"\n\n\"Die in a ditch!\" muttered gruff Silas, with genuine Yankee intolerance\nof any intermission of toil, except on Sunday, the Fourth of July, the\nautumnal cattle-show, Thanksgiving, or the annual Fast,--\"die in a\nditch!  I believe, in my conscience, you would, if there were no\nsteadier means than your own labor to keep you out of it!\"\n\nThe truth was, that an intolerable discontent and irksomeness had come\nover me.  Blithedale was no longer what it had been.  Everything was\nsuddenly faded.  The sunburnt and arid aspect of our woods and\npastures, beneath the August sky, did but imperfectly symbolize the\nlack of dew and moisture, that, since yesterday, as it were, had\nblighted my fields of thought, and penetrated to the innermost and\nshadiest of my contemplative recesses.  The change will be recognized\nby many, who, after a period of happiness, have endeavored to go on\nwith the same kind of life, in the same scene, in spite of the\nalteration or withdrawal of some principal circumstance.  They discover\n(what heretofore, perhaps, they had not known) that it was this which\ngave the bright color and vivid reality to the whole affair.\n\nI stood on other terms than before, not only with Hollingsworth, but\nwith Zenobia and Priscilla.  As regarded the two latter, it was that\ndreamlike and miserable sort of change that denies you the privilege to\ncomplain, because you can assert no positive injury, nor lay your\nfinger on anything tangible.  It is a matter which you do not see, but\nfeel, and which, when you try to analyze it, seems to lose its very\nexistence, and resolve itself into a sickly humor of your own. Your\nunderstanding, possibly, may put faith in this denial.  But your heart\nwill not so easily rest satisfied.  It incessantly remonstrates,\nthough, most of the time, in a bass-note, which you do not separately\ndistinguish; but, now and then, with a sharp cry, importunate to be\nheard, and resolute to claim belief.  \"Things are not as they were!\" it\nkeeps saying.  \"You shall not impose on me!  I will never be quiet!  I\nwill throb painfully!  I will be heavy, and desolate, and shiver with\ncold!  For I, your deep heart, know when to be miserable, as once I\nknew when to be happy!  All is changed for us! You are beloved no\nmore!\"  And were my life to be spent over again, I would invariably\nlend my ear to this Cassandra of the inward depths, however clamorous\nthe music and the merriment of a more superficial region.\n\nMy outbreak with Hollingsworth, though never definitely known to our\nassociates, had really an effect upon the moral atmosphere of the\nCommunity.  It was incidental to the closeness of relationship into\nwhich we had brought ourselves, that an unfriendly state of feeling\ncould not occur between any two members without the whole society being\nmore or less commoted and made uncomfortable thereby.  This species of\nnervous sympathy (though a pretty characteristic enough, sentimentally\nconsidered, and apparently betokening an actual bond of love among us)\nwas yet found rather inconvenient in its practical operation, mortal\ntempers being so infirm and variable as they are. If one of us happened\nto give his neighbor a box on the ear, the tingle was immediately felt\non the same side of everybody's head. Thus, even on the supposition\nthat we were far less quarrelsome than the rest of the world, a great\ndeal of time was necessarily wasted in rubbing our ears.\n\nMusing on all these matters, I felt an inexpressible longing for at\nleast a temporary novelty.  I thought of going across the Rocky\nMountains, or to Europe, or up the Nile; of offering myself a volunteer\non the Exploring Expedition; of taking a ramble of years, no matter in\nwhat direction, and coming back on the other side of the world.  Then,\nshould the colonists of Blithedale have established their enterprise on\na permanent basis, I might fling aside my pilgrim staff and dusty\nshoon, and rest as peacefully here as elsewhere.  Or, in case\nHollingsworth should occupy the ground with his School of Reform, as he\nnow purposed, I might plead earthly guilt enough, by that time, to give\nme what I was inclined to think the only trustworthy hold on his\naffections.  Meanwhile, before deciding on any ultimate plan, I\ndetermined to remove myself to a little distance, and take an exterior\nview of what we had all been about.\n\nIn truth, it was dizzy work, amid such fermentation of opinions as was\ngoing on in the general brain of the Community.  It was a kind of\nBedlam, for the time being, although out of the very thoughts that were\nwildest and most destructive might grow a wisdom, holy, calm, and pure,\nand that should incarnate itself with the substance of a noble and\nhappy life.  But, as matters now were, I felt myself (and, having a\ndecided tendency towards the actual, I never liked to feel it) getting\nquite out of my reckoning, with regard to the existing state of the\nworld.  I was beginning to lose the sense of what kind of a world it\nwas, among innumerable schemes of what it might or ought to be.  It was\nimpossible, situated as we were, not to imbibe the idea that everything\nin nature and human existence was fluid, or fast becoming so; that the\ncrust of the earth in many places was broken, and its whole surface\nportentously upheaving; that it was a day of crisis, and that we\nourselves were in the critical vortex. Our great globe floated in the\natmosphere of infinite space like an unsubstantial bubble.  No\nsagacious man will long retain his sagacity, if he live exclusively\namong reformers and progressive people, without periodically returning\ninto the settled system of things, to correct himself by a new\nobservation from that old standpoint.\n\nIt was now time for me, therefore, to go and hold a little talk with\nthe conservatives, the writers of \"The North American Review,\" the\nmerchants, the politicians, the Cambridge men, and all those\nrespectable old blockheads who still, in this intangibility and\nmistiness of affairs, kept a death-grip on one or two ideas which had\nnot come into vogue since yesterday morning.\n\nThe brethren took leave of me with cordial kindness; and as for the\nsisterhood, I had serious thoughts of kissing them all round, but\nforbore to do so, because, in all such general salutations, the penance\nis fully equal to the pleasure.  So I kissed none of them; and nobody,\nto say the truth, seemed to expect it.\n\n\"Do you wish me,\" I said to Zenobia, \"to announce in town, and at the\nwatering-places, your purpose to deliver a course of lectures on the\nrights of women?\"\n\n\"Women possess no rights,\" said Zenobia, with a half-melancholy smile;\n\"or, at all events, only little girls and grandmothers would have the\nforce to exercise them.\"\n\nShe gave me her hand freely and kindly, and looked at me, I thought,\nwith a pitying expression in her eyes; nor was there any settled light\nof joy in them on her own behalf, but a troubled and passionate flame,\nflickering and fitful.\n\n\"I regret, on the whole, that you are leaving us,\" she said; \"and all\nthe more, since I feel that this phase of our life is finished, and can\nnever be lived over again.  Do you know, Mr. Coverdale, that I have\nbeen several times on the point of making you my confidant, for lack of\na better and wiser one?  But you are too young to be my father\nconfessor; and you would not thank me for treating you like one of\nthose good little handmaidens who share the bosom secrets of a\ntragedy-queen.\"\n\n\"I would, at least, be loyal and faithful,\" answered I; \"and would\ncounsel you with an honest purpose, if not wisely.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Zenobia, \"you would be only too wise, too honest. Honesty\nand wisdom are such a delightful pastime, at another person's expense!\"\n\n\"Ah, Zenobia,\" I exclaimed, \"if you would but let me speak!\"\n\n\"By no means,\" she replied, \"especially when you have just resumed the\nwhole series of social conventionalisms, together with that\nstrait-bodied coat.  I would as lief open my heart to a lawyer or a\nclergyman!  No, no, Mr. Coverdale; if I choose a counsellor, in the\npresent aspect of my affairs, it must be either an angel or a madman;\nand I rather apprehend that the latter would be likeliest of the two to\nspeak the fitting word.  It needs a wild steersman when we voyage\nthrough chaos!  The anchor is up,--farewell!\"\n\nPriscilla, as soon as dinner was over, had betaken herself into a\ncorner, and set to work on a little purse.  As I approached her, she\nlet her eyes rest on me with a calm, serious look; for, with all her\ndelicacy of nerves, there was a singular self-possession in Priscilla,\nand her sensibilities seemed to lie sheltered from ordinary commotion,\nlike the water in a deep well.\n\n\"Will you give me that purse, Priscilla,\" said I, \"as a parting\nkeepsake?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, \"if you will wait till it is finished.\"\n\n\"I must not wait, even for that,\" I replied.  \"Shall I find you here,\non my return?\"\n\n\"I never wish to go away,\" said she.\n\n\"I have sometimes thought,\" observed I, smiling, \"that you, Priscilla,\nare a little prophetess, or, at least, that you have spiritual\nintimations respecting matters which are dark to us grosser people. If\nthat be the case, I should like to ask you what is about to happen; for\nI am tormented with a strong foreboding that, were I to return even so\nsoon as to-morrow morning, I should find everything changed. Have you\nany impressions of this nature?\"\n\n\"Ah, no,\" said Priscilla, looking at me apprehensively.  \"If any such\nmisfortune is coming, the shadow has not reached me yet.  Heaven\nforbid!  I should be glad if there might never be any change, but one\nsummer follow another, and all just like this.\"\n\n\"No summer ever came back, and no two summers ever were alike,\" said I,\nwith a degree of Orphic wisdom that astonished myself.  \"Times change,\nand people change; and if our hearts do not change as readily, so much\nthe worse for us.  Good-by, Priscilla!\"\n\nI gave her hand a pressure, which, I think, she neither resisted nor\nreturned.  Priscilla's heart was deep, but of small compass; it had\nroom but for a very few dearest ones, among whom she never reckoned me.\n\nOn the doorstep I met Hollingsworth.  I had a momentary impulse to hold\nout my hand, or at least to give a parting nod, but resisted both.\nWhen a real and strong affection has come to an end, it is not well to\nmock the sacred past with any show of those commonplace civilities that\nbelong to ordinary intercourse.  Being dead henceforth to him, and he\nto me, there could be no propriety in our chilling one another with the\ntouch of two corpse-like hands, or playing at looks of courtesy with\neyes that were impenetrable beneath the glaze and the film.  We passed,\ntherefore, as if mutually invisible.\n\nI can nowise explain what sort of whim, prank, or perversity it was,\nthat, after all these leave-takings, induced me to go to the pigsty,\nand take leave of the swine!  There they lay, buried as deeply among\nthe straw as they could burrow, four huge black grunters, the very\nsymbols of slothful ease and sensual comfort.  They were asleep,\ndrawing short and heavy breaths, which heaved their big sides up and\ndown.  Unclosing their eyes, however, at my approach, they looked dimly\nforth at the outer world, and simultaneously uttered a gentle grunt;\nnot putting themselves to the trouble of an additional breath for that\nparticular purpose, but grunting with their ordinary inhalation.  They\nwere involved, and almost stifled and buried alive, in their own\ncorporeal substance.  The very unreadiness and oppression wherewith\nthese greasy citizens gained breath enough to keep their life-machinery\nin sluggish movement appeared to make them only the more sensible of\nthe ponderous and fat satisfaction of their existence.  Peeping at me\nan instant out of their small, red, hardly perceptible eyes, they dropt\nasleep again; yet not so far asleep but that their unctuous bliss was\nstill present to them, betwixt dream and reality.\n\n\"You must come back in season to eat part of a spare-rib,\" said Silas\nFoster, giving my hand a mighty squeeze.  \"I shall have these fat\nfellows hanging up by the heels, heads downward, pretty soon, I tell\nyou!\"\n\n\"O cruel Silas, what a horrible idea!\" cried I. \"All the rest of us,\nmen, women, and livestock, save only these four porkers, are bedevilled\nwith one grief or another; they alone are happy,--and you mean to cut\ntheir throats and eat them!  It would be more for the general comfort\nto let them eat us; and bitter and sour morsels we should be!\"\n\n\n\nXVII. THE HOTEL\n\nArriving in town (where my bachelor-rooms, long before this time, had\nreceived some other occupant), I established myself, for a day or two,\nin a certain, respectable hotel.  It was situated somewhat aloof from\nmy former track in life; my present mood inclining me to avoid most of\nmy old companions, from whom I was now sundered by other interests, and\nwho would have been likely enough to amuse themselves at the expense of\nthe amateur workingman.  The hotel-keeper put me into a back room of\nthe third story of his spacious establishment. The day was lowering,\nwith occasional gusts of rain, and an ugly tempered east wind, which\nseemed to come right off the chill and melancholy sea, hardly mitigated\nby sweeping over the roofs, and amalgamating itself with the dusky\nelement of city smoke.  All the effeminacy of past days had returned\nupon me at once.  Summer as it still was, I ordered a coal fire in the\nrusty grate, and was glad to find myself growing a little too warm with\nan artificial temperature.\n\nMy sensations were those of a traveller, long sojourning in remote\nregions, and at length sitting down again amid customs once familiar.\nThere was a newness and an oldness oddly combining themselves into one\nimpression.  It made me acutely sensible how strange a piece of\nmosaic-work had lately been wrought into my life.  True, if you look at\nit in one way, it had been only a summer in the country.  But,\nconsidered in a profounder relation, it was part of another age, a\ndifferent state of society, a segment of an existence peculiar in its\naims and methods, a leaf of some mysterious volume interpolated into\nthe current history which time was writing off.  At one moment, the\nvery circumstances now surrounding me--my coal fire and the dingy room\nin the bustling hotel--appeared far off and intangible; the next\ninstant Blithedale looked vague, as if it were at a distance both in\ntime and space, and so shadowy that a question might be raised whether\nthe whole affair had been anything more than the thoughts of a\nspeculative man.  I had never before experienced a mood that so robbed\nthe actual world of its solidity.  It nevertheless involved a charm, on\nwhich--a devoted epicure of my own emotions--I resolved to pause, and\nenjoy the moral sillabub until quite dissolved away.\n\nWhatever had been my taste for solitude and natural scenery, yet the\nthick, foggy, stifled element of cities, the entangled life of many men\ntogether, sordid as it was, and empty of the beautiful, took quite as\nstrenuous a hold upon my mind.  I felt as if there could never be\nenough of it.  Each characteristic sound was too suggestive to be\npassed over unnoticed.  Beneath and around me, I heard the stir of the\nhotel; the loud voices of guests, landlord, or bar-keeper; steps\nechoing on the staircase; the ringing of a bell, announcing arrivals or\ndepartures; the porter lumbering past my door with baggage, which he\nthumped down upon the floors of neighboring chambers; the lighter feet\nof chambermaids scudding along the passages;--it is ridiculous to think\nwhat an interest they had for me! From the street came the tumult of\nthe pavements, pervading the whole house with a continual uproar, so\nbroad and deep that only an unaccustomed ear would dwell upon it.  A\ncompany of the city soldiery, with a full military band, marched in\nfront of the hotel, invisible to me, but stirringly audible both by its\nfoot-tramp and the clangor of its instruments.  Once or twice all the\ncity bells jangled together, announcing a fire, which brought out the\nengine-men and their machines, like an army with its artillery rushing\nto battle. Hour by hour the clocks in many steeples responded one to\nanother.\n\nIn some public hall, not a great way off, there seemed to be an\nexhibition of a mechanical diorama; for three times during the day\noccurred a repetition of obstreperous music, winding up with the rattle\nof imitative cannon and musketry, and a huge final explosion. Then\nensued the applause of the spectators, with clap of hands and thump of\nsticks, and the energetic pounding of their heels.  All this was just\nas valuable, in its way, as the sighing of the breeze among the\nbirch-trees that overshadowed Eliot's pulpit.\n\nYet I felt a hesitation about plunging into this muddy tide of human\nactivity and pastime.  It suited me better, for the present, to linger\non the brink, or hover in the air above it.  So I spent the first day,\nand the greater part of the second, in the laziest manner possible, in\na rocking-chair, inhaling the fragrance of a series of cigars, with my\nlegs and slippered feet horizontally disposed, and in my hand a novel\npurchased of a railroad bibliopolist.  The gradual waste of my cigar\naccomplished itself with an easy and gentle expenditure of breath.  My\nbook was of the dullest, yet had a sort of sluggish flow, like that of\na stream in which your boat is as often aground as afloat.  Had there\nbeen a more impetuous rush, a more absorbing passion of the narrative,\nI should the sooner have struggled out of its uneasy current, and have\ngiven myself up to the swell and subsidence of my thoughts.  But, as it\nwas, the torpid life of the book served as an unobtrusive accompaniment\nto the life within me and about me.  At intervals, however, when its\neffect grew a little too soporific,--not for my patience, but for the\npossibility of keeping my eyes open, I bestirred myself, started from\nthe rocking-chair, and looked out of the window.\n\nA gray sky; the weathercock of a steeple that rose beyond the opposite\nrange of buildings, pointing from the eastward; a sprinkle of small,\nspiteful-looking raindrops on the window-pane.  In that ebb-tide of my\nenergies, had I thought of venturing abroad, these tokens would have\nchecked the abortive purpose.\n\nAfter several such visits to the window, I found myself getting pretty\nwell acquainted with that little portion of the backside of the\nuniverse which it presented to my view.  Over against the hotel and its\nadjacent houses, at the distance of forty or fifty yards, was the rear\nof a range of buildings which appeared to be spacious, modern, and\ncalculated for fashionable residences.  The interval between was\napportioned into grass-plots, and here and there an apology for a\ngarden, pertaining severally to these dwellings.  There were\napple-trees, and pear and peach trees, too, the fruit on which looked\nsingularly large, luxuriant, and abundant, as well it might, in a\nsituation so warm and sheltered, and where the soil had doubtless been\nenriched to a more than natural fertility.  In two or three places\ngrapevines clambered upon trellises, and bore clusters already purple,\nand promising the richness of Malta or Madeira in their ripened juice.\nThe blighting winds of our rigid climate could not molest these trees\nand vines; the sunshine, though descending late into this area, and too\nearly intercepted by the height of the surrounding houses, yet lay\ntropically there, even when less than temperate in every other region.\nDreary as was the day, the scene was illuminated by not a few sparrows\nand other birds, which spread their wings, and flitted and fluttered,\nand alighted now here, now there, and busily scratched their food out\nof the wormy earth.  Most of these winged people seemed to have their\ndomicile in a robust and healthy buttonwood-tree.  It aspired upward,\nhigh above the roofs of the houses, and spread a dense head of foliage\nhalf across the area.\n\nThere was a cat--as there invariably is in such places--who evidently\nthought herself entitled to the privileges of forest life in this close\nheart of city conventionalisms.  I watched her creeping along the low,\nflat roofs of the offices, descending a flight of wooden steps, gliding\namong the grass, and besieging the buttonwood-tree, with murderous\npurpose against its feathered citizens.  But, after all, they were\nbirds of city breeding, and doubtless knew how to guard themselves\nagainst the peculiar perils of their position.\n\nBewitching to my fancy are all those nooks and crannies where Nature,\nlike a stray partridge, hides her head among the long-established\nhaunts of men!  It is likewise to be remarked, as a general rule, that\nthere is far more of the picturesque, more truth to native and\ncharacteristic tendencies, and vastly greater suggestiveness in the\nback view of a residence, whether in town or country, than in its\nfront.  The latter is always artificial; it is meant for the world's\neye, and is therefore a veil and a concealment.  Realities keep in the\nrear, and put forward an advance guard of show and humbug.  The\nposterior aspect of any old farmhouse, behind which a railroad has\nunexpectedly been opened, is so different from that looking upon the\nimmemorial highway, that the spectator gets new ideas of rural life and\nindividuality in the puff or two of steam-breath which shoots him past\nthe premises.  In a city, the distinction between what is offered to\nthe public and what is kept for the family is certainly not less\nstriking.\n\nBut, to return to my window at the back of the hotel.  Together with a\ndue contemplation of the fruit-trees, the grapevines, the\nbuttonwood-tree, the cat, the birds, and many other particulars, I\nfailed not to study the row of fashionable dwellings to which all these\nappertained.  Here, it must be confessed, there was a general sameness.\nFrom the upper story to the first floor, they were so much alike, that\nI could only conceive of the inhabitants as cut out on one identical\npattern, like little wooden toy-people of German manufacture.  One\nlong, united roof, with its thousands of slates glittering in the rain,\nextended over the whole.  After the distinctness of separate characters\nto which I had recently been accustomed, it perplexed and annoyed me\nnot to be able to resolve this combination of human interests into\nwell-defined elements.  It seemed hardly worth while for more than one\nof those families to be in existence, since they all had the same\nglimpse of the sky, all looked into the same area, all received just\ntheir equal share of sunshine through the front windows, and all\nlistened to precisely the same noises of the street on which they\nboarded.  Men are so much alike in their nature, that they grow\nintolerable unless varied by their circumstances.\n\nJust about this time a waiter entered my room.  The truth was, I had\nrung the bell and ordered a sherry-cobbler.\n\n\n\"Can you tell me,\" I inquired, \"what families reside in any of those\nhouses opposite?\"\n\n\"The one right opposite is a rather stylish boarding-house,\" said the\nwaiter.  \"Two of the gentlemen boarders keep horses at the stable of\nour establishment.  They do things in very good style, sir, the people\nthat live there.\"\n\nI might have found out nearly as much for myself, on examining the\nhouse a little more closely, in one of the upper chambers I saw a young\nman in a dressing-gown, standing before the glass and brushing his hair\nfor a quarter of an hour together.  He then spent an equal space of\ntime in the elaborate arrangement of his cravat, and finally made his\nappearance in a dress-coat, which I suspected to be newly come from the\ntailor's, and now first put on for a dinner-party.  At a window of the\nnext story below, two children, prettily dressed, were looking out.  By\nand by a middle-aged gentleman came softly behind them, kissed the\nlittle girl, and playfully pulled the little boy's ear.  It was a papa,\nno doubt, just come in from his counting-room or office; and anon\nappeared mamma, stealing as softly behind papa as he had stolen behind\nthe children, and laying her hand on his shoulder to surprise him.\nThen followed a kiss between papa and mamma; but a noiseless one, for\nthe children did not turn their heads.\n\n\"I bless God for these good folks!\" thought I to myself.  \"I have not\nseen a prettier bit of nature, in all my summer in the country, than\nthey have shown me here, in a rather stylish boarding-house.  I will\npay them a little more attention by and by.\"\n\nOn the first floor, an iron balustrade ran along in front of the tall\nand spacious windows, evidently belonging to a back drawing-room; and\nfar into the interior, through the arch of the sliding-doors, I could\ndiscern a gleam from the windows of the front apartment.  There were no\nsigns of present occupancy in this suite of rooms; the curtains being\nenveloped in a protective covering, which allowed but a small portion\nof their crimson material to be seen.  But two housemaids were\nindustriously at work; so that there was good prospect that the\nboarding-house might not long suffer from the absence of its most\nexpensive and profitable guests.  Meanwhile, until they should appear,\nI cast my eyes downward to the lower regions.  There, in the dusk that\nso early settles into such places, I saw the red glow of the kitchen\nrange.  The hot cook, or one of her subordinates, with a ladle in her\nhand, came to draw a cool breath at the back door.  As soon as she\ndisappeared, an Irish man-servant, in a white jacket, crept slyly\nforth, and threw away the fragments of a china dish, which,\nunquestionably, he had just broken.  Soon afterwards, a lady, showily\ndressed, with a curling front of what must have been false hair, and\nreddish-brown, I suppose, in hue,--though my remoteness allowed me only\nto guess at such particulars,--this respectable mistress of the\nboarding-house made a momentary transit across the kitchen window, and\nappeared no more.  It was her final, comprehensive glance, in order to\nmake sure that soup, fish, and flesh were in a proper state of\nreadiness, before the serving up of dinner.\n\nThere was nothing else worth noticing about the house, unless it be\nthat on the peak of one of the dormer windows which opened out of the\nroof sat a dove, looking very dreary and forlorn; insomuch that I\nwondered why she chose to sit there, in the chilly rain, while her\nkindred were doubtless nestling in a warm and comfortable dove-cote.\nAll at once this dove spread her wings, and, launching herself in the\nair, came flying so straight across the intervening space, that I fully\nexpected her to alight directly on my window-sill.  In the latter part\nof her course, however, she swerved aside, flew upward, and vanished,\nas did, likewise, the slight, fantastic pathos with which I had\ninvested her.\n\n\n\nXVIII. THE BOARDING-HOUSE\n\nThe next day, as soon as I thought of looking again towards the\nopposite house, there sat the dove again, on the peak of the same\ndormer window!  It was by no means an early hour, for the preceding\nevening I had ultimately mustered enterprise enough to visit the\ntheatre, had gone late to bed, and slept beyond all limit, in my\nremoteness from Silas Foster's awakening horn.  Dreams had tormented me\nthroughout the night.  The train of thoughts which, for months past,\nhad worn a track through my mind, and to escape which was one of my\nchief objects in leaving Blithedale, kept treading remorselessly to and\nfro in their old footsteps, while slumber left me impotent to regulate\nthem.  It was not till I had quitted my three friends that they first\nbegan to encroach upon my dreams.  In those of the last night,\nHollingsworth and Zenobia, standing on either side of my bed, had bent\nacross it to exchange a kiss of passion. Priscilla, beholding\nthis,--for she seemed to be peeping in at the chamber window,--had\nmelted gradually away, and left only the sadness of her expression in\nmy heart.  There it still lingered, after I awoke; one of those\nunreasonable sadnesses that you know not how to deal with, because it\ninvolves nothing for common-sense to clutch.\n\nIt was a gray and dripping forenoon; gloomy enough in town, and still\ngloomier in the haunts to which my recollections persisted in\ntransporting me.  For, in spite of my efforts to think of something\nelse, I thought how the gusty rain was drifting over the slopes and\nvalleys of our farm; how wet must be the foliage that overshadowed the\npulpit rock; how cheerless, in such a day, my hermitage--the\ntree-solitude of my owl-like humors--in the vine-encircled heart of the\ntall pine!  It was a phase of homesickness.  I had wrenched myself too\nsuddenly out of an accustomed sphere.  There was no choice, now, but to\nbear the pang of whatever heartstrings were snapt asunder, and that\nillusive torment (like the ache of a limb long ago cut off) by which a\npast mode of life prolongs itself into the succeeding one.  I was full\nof idle and shapeless regrets.  The thought impressed itself upon me\nthat I had left duties unperformed. With the power, perhaps, to act in\nthe place of destiny and avert misfortune from my friends, I had\nresigned them to their fate.  That cold tendency, between instinct and\nintellect, which made me pry with a speculative interest into people's\npassions and impulses, appeared to have gone far towards unhumanizing\nmy heart.\n\nBut a man cannot always decide for himself whether his own heart is\ncold or warm.  It now impresses me that, if I erred at all in regard to\nHollingsworth, Zenobia, and Priscilla, it was through too much\nsympathy, rather than too little.\n\nTo escape the irksomeness of these meditations, I resumed my post at\nthe window.  At first sight, there was nothing new to be noticed. The\ngeneral aspect of affairs was the same as yesterday, except that the\nmore decided inclemency of to-day had driven the sparrows to shelter,\nand kept the cat within doors; whence, however, she soon emerged,\npursued by the cook, and with what looked like the better half of a\nroast chicken in her mouth.  The young man in the dress-coat was\ninvisible; the two children, in the story below, seemed to be romping\nabout the room, under the superintendence of a nursery-maid.  The\ndamask curtains of the drawing-room, on the first floor, were now fully\ndisplayed, festooned gracefully from top to bottom of the windows,\nwhich extended from the ceiling to the carpet. A narrower window, at\nthe left of the drawing-room, gave light to what was probably a small\nboudoir, within which I caught the faintest imaginable glimpse of a\ngirl's figure, in airy drapery.  Her arm was in regular movement, as if\nshe were busy with her German worsted, or some other such pretty and\nunprofitable handiwork.\n\nWhile intent upon making out this girlish shape, I became sensible that\na figure had appeared at one of the windows of the drawing-room. There\nwas a presentiment in my mind; or perhaps my first glance, imperfect\nand sidelong as it was, had sufficed to convey subtile information of\nthe truth.  At any rate, it was with no positive surprise, but as if I\nhad all along expected the incident, that, directing my eyes\nthitherward, I beheld--like a full-length picture, in the space between\nthe heavy festoons of the window curtains--no other than Zenobia!  At\nthe same instant, my thoughts made sure of the identity of the figure\nin the boudoir.  It could only be Priscilla.\n\nZenobia was attired, not in the almost rustic costume which she had\nheretofore worn, but in a fashionable morning-dress.  There was,\nnevertheless, one familiar point.  She had, as usual, a flower in her\nhair, brilliant and of a rare variety, else it had not been Zenobia.\nAfter a brief pause at the window, she turned away, exemplifying, in\nthe few steps that removed her out of sight, that noble and beautiful\nmotion which characterized her as much as any other personal charm. Not\none woman in a thousand could move so admirably as Zenobia.  Many women\ncan sit gracefully; some can stand gracefully; and a few, perhaps, can\nassume a series of graceful positions.  But natural movement is the\nresult and expression of the whole being, and cannot be well and nobly\nperformed unless responsive to something in the character.  I often\nused to think that music--light and airy, wild and passionate, or the\nfull harmony of stately marches, in accordance with her varying\nmood--should have attended Zenobia's footsteps.\n\nI waited for her reappearance.  It was one peculiarity, distinguishing\nZenobia from most of her sex, that she needed for her moral well-being,\nand never would forego, a large amount of physical exercise.  At\nBlithedale, no inclemency of sky or muddiness of earth had ever impeded\nher daily walks.  Here in town, she probably preferred to tread the\nextent of the two drawing-rooms, and measure out the miles by spaces of\nforty feet, rather than bedraggle her skirts over the sloppy pavements.\nAccordingly, in about the time requisite to pass through the arch of\nthe sliding-doors to the front window, and to return upon her steps,\nthere she stood again, between the festoons of the crimson curtains.\nBut another personage was now added to the scene.  Behind Zenobia\nappeared that face which I had first encountered in the wood-path; the\nman who had passed, side by side with her, in such mysterious\nfamiliarity and estrangement, beneath my vine curtained hermitage in\nthe tall pine-tree.  It was Westervelt.  And though he was looking\nclosely over her shoulder, it still seemed to me, as on the former\noccasion, that Zenobia repelled him,--that, perchance, they mutually\nrepelled each other, by some incompatibility of their spheres.\n\nThis impression, however, might have been altogether the result of\nfancy and prejudice in me.  The distance was so great as to obliterate\nany play of feature by which I might otherwise have been made a\npartaker of their counsels.\n\nThere now needed only Hollingsworth and old Moodie to complete the knot\nof characters, whom a real intricacy of events, greatly assisted by my\nmethod of insulating them from other relations, had kept so long upon\nmy mental stage, as actors in a drama.  In itself, perhaps, it was no\nvery remarkable event that they should thus come across me, at the\nmoment when I imagined myself free.  Zenobia, as I well knew, had\nretained an establishment in town, and had not unfrequently withdrawn\nherself from Blithedale during brief intervals, on one of which\noccasions she had taken Priscilla along with her.  Nevertheless, there\nseemed something fatal in the coincidence that had borne me to this one\nspot, of all others in a great city, and transfixed me there, and\ncompelled me again to waste my already wearied sympathies on affairs\nwhich were none of mine, and persons who cared little for me.  It\nirritated my nerves; it affected me with a kind of heart-sickness.\nAfter the effort which it cost me to fling them off,--after\nconsummating my escape, as I thought, from these goblins of flesh and\nblood, and pausing to revive myself with a breath or two of an\natmosphere in which they should have no share,--it was a positive\ndespair to find the same figures arraying themselves before me, and\npresenting their old problem in a shape that made it more insoluble\nthan ever.\n\nI began to long for a catastrophe.  If the noble temper of\nHollingsworth's soul were doomed to be utterly corrupted by the too\npowerful purpose which had grown out of what was noblest in him; if the\nrich and generous qualities of Zenobia's womanhood might not save her;\nif Priscilla must perish by her tenderness and faith, so simple and so\ndevout, then be it so!  Let it all come!  As for me, I would look on,\nas it seemed my part to do, understandingly, if my intellect could\nfathom the meaning and the moral, and, at all events, reverently and\nsadly.  The curtain fallen, I would pass onward with my poor individual\nlife, which was now attenuated of much of its proper substance, and\ndiffused among many alien interests.\n\nMeanwhile, Zenobia and her companion had retreated from the window.\nThen followed an interval, during which I directed my eves towards the\nfigure in the boudoir.  Most certainly it was Priscilla, although\ndressed with a novel and fanciful elegance.  The vague perception of\nit, as viewed so far off, impressed me as if she had suddenly passed\nout of a chrysalis state and put forth wings.  Her hands were not now\nin motion.  She had dropt her work, and sat with her head thrown back,\nin the same attitude that I had seen several times before, when she\nseemed to be listening to an imperfectly distinguished sound.\n\nAgain the two figures in the drawing-room became visible.  They were\nnow a little withdrawn from the window, face to face, and, as I could\nsee by Zenobia's emphatic gestures, were discussing some subject in\nwhich she, at least, felt a passionate concern.  By and by she broke\naway, and vanished beyond my ken.  Westervelt approached the window,\nand leaned his forehead against a pane of glass, displaying the sort of\nsmile on his handsome features which, when I before met him, had let me\ninto the secret of his gold-bordered teeth.  Every human being, when\ngiven over to the Devil, is sure to have the wizard mark upon him, in\none form or another.  I fancied that this smile, with its peculiar\nrevelation, was the Devil's signet on the Professor.\n\nThis man, as I had soon reason to know, was endowed with a cat-like\ncircumspection; and though precisely the most unspiritual quality in\nthe world, it was almost as effective as spiritual insight in making\nhim acquainted with whatever it suited him to discover.  He now proved\nit, considerably to my discomfiture, by detecting and recognizing me,\nat my post of observation.  Perhaps I ought to have blushed at being\ncaught in such an evident scrutiny of Professor Westervelt and his\naffairs.  Perhaps I did blush.  Be that as it might, I retained\npresence of mind enough not to make my position yet more irksome by the\npoltroonery of drawing back.\n\nWestervelt looked into the depths of the drawing-room, and beckoned.\nImmediately afterwards Zenobia appeared at the window, with color much\nheightened, and eyes which, as my conscience whispered me, were\nshooting bright arrows, barbed with scorn, across the intervening\nspace, directed full at my sensibilities as a gentleman.  If the truth\nmust be told, far as her flight-shot was, those arrows hit the mark.\nShe signified her recognition of me by a gesture with her head and\nhand, comprising at once a salutation and dismissal.  The next moment\nshe administered one of those pitiless rebukes which a woman always has\nat hand, ready for any offence (and which she so seldom spares on due\noccasion), by letting down a white linen curtain between the festoons\nof the damask ones.  It fell like the drop-curtain of a theatre, in the\ninterval between the acts.\n\nPriscilla had disappeared from the boudoir.  But the dove still kept\nher desolate perch on the peak of the attic window.\n\n\n\nXIX. ZENOBIA'S DRAWING-ROOM\n\nThe remainder of the day, so far as I was concerned, was spent in\nmeditating on these recent incidents.  I contrived, and alternately\nrejected, innumerable methods of accounting for the presence of Zenobia\nand Priscilla, and the connection of Westervelt with both. It must be\nowned, too, that I had a keen, revengeful sense of the insult inflicted\nby Zenobia's scornful recognition, and more particularly by her letting\ndown the curtain; as if such were the proper barrier to be interposed\nbetween a character like hers and a perceptive faculty like mine.  For,\nwas mine a mere vulgar curiosity? Zenobia should have known me better\nthan to suppose it.  She should have been able to appreciate that\nquality of the intellect and the heart which impelled me (often against\nmy own will, and to the detriment of my own comfort) to live in other\nlives, and to endeavor--by generous sympathies, by delicate intuitions,\nby taking note of things too slight for record, and by bringing my\nhuman spirit into manifold accordance with the companions whom God\nassigned me--to learn the secret which was hidden even from themselves.\n\nOf all possible observers, methought a woman like Zenobia and a man\nlike Hollingsworth should have selected me.  And now when the event has\nlong been past, I retain the same opinion of my fitness for the office.\nTrue, I might have condemned them.  Had I been judge as well as\nwitness, my sentence might have been stern as that of destiny itself.\nBut, still, no trait of original nobility of character, no struggle\nagainst temptation,--no iron necessity of will, on the one hand, nor\nextenuating circumstance to be derived from passion and despair, on the\nother,--no remorse that might coexist with error, even if powerless to\nprevent it,--no proud repentance that should claim retribution as a\nmeed,--would go unappreciated.  True, again, I might give my full\nassent to the punishment which was sure to follow. But it would be\ngiven mournfully, and with undiminished love.  And, after all was\nfinished, I would come as if to gather up the white ashes of those who\nhad perished at the stake, and to tell the world--the wrong being now\natoned for--how much had perished there which it had never yet known\nhow to praise.\n\nI sat in my rocking-chair, too far withdrawn from the window to expose\nmyself to another rebuke like that already inflicted.  My eyes still\nwandered towards the opposite house, but without effecting any new\ndiscoveries.  Late in the afternoon, the weathercock on the church\nspire indicated a change of wind; the sun shone dimly out, as if the\ngolden wine of its beams were mingled half-and-half with water.\nNevertheless, they kindled up the whole range of edifices, threw a glow\nover the windows, glistened on the wet roofs, and, slowly withdrawing\nupward, perched upon the chimney-tops; thence they took a higher\nflight, and lingered an instant on the tip of the spire, making it the\nfinal point of more cheerful light in the whole sombre scene.  The next\nmoment, it was all gone.  The twilight fell into the area like a shower\nof dusky snow, and before it was quite dark, the gong of the hotel\nsummoned me to tea.\n\nWhen I returned to my chamber, the glow of an astral lamp was\npenetrating mistily through the white curtain of Zenobia's\ndrawing-room.  The shadow of a passing figure was now and then cast\nupon this medium, but with too vague an outline for even my adventurous\nconjectures to read the hieroglyphic that it presented.\n\nAll at once, it occurred to me how very absurd was my behavior in thus\ntormenting myself with crazy hypotheses as to what was going on within\nthat drawing-room, when it was at my option to be personally present\nthere, My relations with Zenobia, as yet unchanged,--as a familiar\nfriend, and associated in the same life-long enterprise,--gave me the\nright, and made it no more than kindly courtesy demanded, to call on\nher.  Nothing, except our habitual independence of conventional rules\nat Blithedale, could have kept me from sooner recognizing this duty.\nAt all events, it should now be performed.\n\nIn compliance with this sudden impulse, I soon found myself actually\nwithin the house, the rear of which, for two days past, I had been so\nsedulously watching.  A servant took my card, and, immediately\nreturning, ushered me upstairs.  On the way, I heard a rich, and, as it\nwere, triumphant burst of music from a piano, in which I felt Zenobia's\ncharacter, although heretofore I had known nothing of her skill upon\nthe instrument.  Two or three canary-birds, excited by this gush of\nsound, sang piercingly, and did their utmost to produce a kindred\nmelody.  A bright illumination streamed through, the door of the front\ndrawing-room; and I had barely stept across the threshold before\nZenobia came forward to meet me, laughing, and with an extended hand.\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Coverdale,\" said she, still smiling, but, as I thought, with a\ngood deal of scornful anger underneath, \"it has gratified me to see the\ninterest which you continue to take in my affairs!  I have long\nrecognized you as a sort of transcendental Yankee, with all the native\npropensity of your countrymen to investigate matters that come within\ntheir range, but rendered almost poetical, in your case, by the refined\nmethods which you adopt for its gratification.  After all, it was an\nunjustifiable stroke, on my part,--was it not?--to let down the window\ncurtain!\"\n\n\"I cannot call it a very wise one,\" returned I, with a secret\nbitterness, which, no doubt, Zenobia appreciated.  \"It is really\nimpossible to hide anything in this world, to say nothing of the next.\nAll that we ought to ask, therefore, is, that the witnesses of our\nconduct, and the speculators on our motives, should be capable of\ntaking the highest view which the circumstances of the case may admit.\nSo much being secured, I, for one, would be most happy in feeling\nmyself followed everywhere by an indefatigable human sympathy.\"\n\n\"We must trust for intelligent sympathy to our guardian angels, if any\nthere be,\" said Zenobia.  \"As long as the only spectator of my poor\ntragedy is a young man at the window of his hotel, I must still claim\nthe liberty to drop the curtain.\"\n\nWhile this passed, as Zenobia's hand was extended, I had applied the\nvery slightest touch of my fingers to her own.  In spite of an external\nfreedom, her manner made me sensible that we stood upon no real terms\nof confidence.  The thought came sadly across me, how great was the\ncontrast betwixt this interview and our first meeting. Then, in the\nwarm light of the country fireside, Zenobia had greeted me cheerily and\nhopefully, with a full sisterly grasp of the hand, conveying as much\nkindness in it as other women could have evinced by the pressure of\nboth arms around my neck, or by yielding a cheek to the brotherly\nsalute.  The difference was as complete as between her appearance at\nthat time--so simply attired, and with only the one superb flower in\nher hair--and now, when her beauty was set off by all that dress and\nornament could do for it.  And they did much.  Not, indeed, that they\ncreated or added anything to what Nature had lavishly done for Zenobia.\nBut, those costly robes which she had on, those flaming jewels on her\nneck, served as lamps to display the personal advantages which required\nnothing less than such an illumination to be fully seen.  Even her\ncharacteristic flower, though it seemed to be still there, had\nundergone a cold and bright transfiguration; it was a flower\nexquisitely imitated in jeweller's work, and imparting the last touch\nthat transformed Zenobia into a work of art.\n\n\"I scarcely feel,\" I could not forbear saying, \"as if we had ever met\nbefore.  How many years ago it seems since we last sat beneath Eliot's\npulpit, with Hollingsworth extended on the fallen leaves, and Priscilla\nat his feet!  Can it be, Zenobia, that you ever really numbered\nyourself with our little band of earnest, thoughtful, philanthropic\nlaborers?\"\n\n\"Those ideas have their time and place,\" she answered coldly.  \"But I\nfancy it must be a very circumscribed mind that can find room for no\nother.\"\n\nHer manner bewildered me.  Literally, moreover, I was dazzled by the\nbrilliancy of the room.  A chandelier hung down in the centre, glowing\nwith I know not how many lights; there were separate lamps, also, on\ntwo or three tables, and on marble brackets, adding their white\nradiance to that of the chandelier.  The furniture was exceedingly\nrich.  Fresh from our old farmhouse, with its homely board and benches\nin the dining-room, and a few wicker chairs in the best parlor, it\nstruck me that here was the fulfilment of every fantasy of an\nimagination revelling in various methods of costly self-indulgence and\nsplendid ease.  Pictures, marbles, vases,--in brief, more shapes of\nluxury than there could be any object in enumerating, except for an\nauctioneer's advertisement,--and the whole repeated and doubled by the\nreflection of a great mirror, which showed me Zenobia's proud figure,\nlikewise, and my own.  It cost me, I acknowledge, a bitter sense of\nshame, to perceive in myself a positive effort to bear up against the\neffect which Zenobia sought to impose on me.  I reasoned against her,\nin my secret mind, and strove so to keep my footing.  In the\ngorgeousness with which she had surrounded herself,--in the redundance\nof personal ornament, which the largeness of her physical nature and\nthe rich type of her beauty caused to seem so suitable,--I malevolently\nbeheld the true character of the woman, passionate, luxurious, lacking\nsimplicity, not deeply refined, incapable of pure and perfect taste.\nBut, the next instant, she was too powerful for all my opposing\nstruggles.  I saw how fit it was that she should make herself as\ngorgeous as she pleased, and should do a thousand things that would\nhave been ridiculous in the poor, thin, weakly characters of other\nwomen.  To this day, however, I hardly know whether I then beheld\nZenobia in her truest attitude, or whether that were the truer one in\nwhich she had presented herself at Blithedale.  In both, there was\nsomething like the illusion which a great actress flings around her.\n\n\"Have you given up Blithedale forever?\"  I inquired.\n\n\"Why should you think so?\" asked she.\n\n\"I cannot tell,\" answered I; \"except that it appears all like a dream\nthat we were ever there together.\"\n\n\"It is not so to me,\" said Zenobia.  \"I should think it a poor and\nmeagre nature that is capable of but one set of forms, and must convert\nall the past into a dream merely because the present happens to be\nunlike it.  Why should we be content with our homely life of a few\nmonths past, to the exclusion of all other modes?  It was good; but\nthere are other lives as good, or better.  Not, you will understand,\nthat I condemn those who give themselves up to it more entirely than I,\nfor myself, should deem it wise to do.\"\n\nIt irritated me, this self-complacent, condescending, qualified\napproval and criticism of a system to which many individuals--perhaps\nas highly endowed as our gorgeous Zenobia--had contributed their all of\nearthly endeavor, and their loftiest aspirations.  I determined to make\nproof if there were any spell that would exorcise her out of the part\nwhich she seemed to be acting.  She should be compelled to give me a\nglimpse of something true; some nature, some passion, no matter whether\nright or wrong, provided it were real.\n\n\"Your allusion to that class of circumscribed characters who can live\nonly in one mode of life,\" remarked I coolly, \"reminds me of our poor\nfriend Hollingsworth.  Possibly he was in your thoughts when you spoke\nthus.  Poor fellow!  It is a pity that, by the fault of a narrow\neducation, he should have so completely immolated himself to that one\nidea of his, especially as the slightest modicum of common-sense would\nteach him its utter impracticability.  Now that I have returned into\nthe world, and can look at his project from a distance, it requires\nquite all my real regard for this respectable and well-intentioned man\nto prevent me laughing at him,--as I find society at large does.\"\n\nZenobia's eyes darted lightning, her cheeks flushed, the vividness of\nher expression was like the effect of a powerful light flaming up\nsuddenly within her.  My experiment had fully succeeded.  She had shown\nme the true flesh and blood of her heart, by thus involuntarily\nresenting my slight, pitying, half-kind, half-scornful mention of the\nman who was all in all with her.  She herself probably felt this; for\nit was hardly a moment before she tranquillized her uneven breath, and\nseemed as proud and self-possessed as ever.\n\n\"I rather imagine,\" said she quietly, \"that your appreciation falls\nshort of Mr. Hollingsworth's just claims.  Blind enthusiasm, absorption\nin one idea, I grant, is generally ridiculous, and must be fatal to the\nrespectability of an ordinary man; it requires a very high and powerful\ncharacter to make it otherwise.  But a great man--as, perhaps, you do\nnot know--attains his normal condition only through the inspiration of\none great idea.  As a friend of Mr. Hollingsworth, and, at the same\ntime, a calm observer, I must tell you that he seems to me such a man.\nBut you are very pardonable for fancying him ridiculous.  Doubtless, he\nis so--to you!  There can be no truer test of the noble and heroic, in\nany individual, than the degree in which he possesses the faculty of\ndistinguishing heroism from absurdity.\"\n\nI dared make no retort to Zenobia's concluding apothegm.  In truth, I\nadmired her fidelity.  It gave me a new sense of Hollingsworth's native\npower, to discover that his influence was no less potent with this\nbeautiful woman here, in the midst of artificial life, than it had been\nat the foot of the gray rock, and among the wild birch-trees of the\nwood-path, when she so passionately pressed his hand against her heart.\nThe great, rude, shaggy, swarthy man!  And Zenobia loved him!\n\n\"Did you bring Priscilla with you?\"  I resumed.  \"Do you know I have\nsometimes fancied it not quite safe, considering the susceptibility of\nher temperament, that she should be so constantly within the sphere of\na man like Hollingsworth.  Such tender and delicate natures, among your\nsex, have often, I believe, a very adequate appreciation of the heroic\nelement in men.  But then, again, I should suppose them as likely as\nany other women to make a reciprocal impression. Hollingsworth could\nhardly give his affections to a person capable of taking an independent\nstand, but only to one whom he might absorb into himself.  He has\ncertainly shown great tenderness for Priscilla.\"\n\nZenobia had turned aside.  But I caught the reflection of her face in\nthe mirror, and saw that it was very pale,--as pale, in her rich\nattire, as if a shroud were round her.\n\n\"Priscilla is here,\" said she, her voice a little lower than usual.\n\"Have not you learnt as much from your chamber window?  Would you like\nto see her?\"\n\nShe made a step or two into the back drawing-room, and\ncalled,--\"Priscilla!  Dear Priscilla!\"\n\n\n\nXX. THEY VANISH\n\nPriscilla immediately answered the summons, and made her appearance\nthrough the door of the boudoir.  I had conceived the idea, which I now\nrecognized as a very foolish one, that Zenobia would have taken\nmeasures to debar me from an interview with this girl, between whom and\nherself there was so utter an opposition of their dearest interests,\nthat, on one part or the other, a great grief, if not likewise a great\nwrong, seemed a matter of necessity.  But, as Priscilla was only a leaf\nfloating on the dark current of events, without influencing them by her\nown choice or plan, as she probably guessed not whither the stream was\nbearing her, nor perhaps even felt its inevitable movement,--there\ncould be no peril of her communicating to me any intelligence with\nregard to Zenobia's purposes.\n\nOn perceiving me, she came forward with great quietude of manner; and\nwhen I held out my hand, her own moved slightly towards it, as if\nattracted by a feeble degree of magnetism.\n\n\"I am glad to see you, my dear Priscilla,\" said I, still holding her\nhand; \"but everything that I meet with nowadays makes me wonder whether\nI am awake.  You, especially, have always seemed like a figure in a\ndream, and now more than ever.\"\n\n\"Oh, there is substance in these fingers of mine,\" she answered, giving\nmy hand the faintest possible pressure, and then taking away her own.\n\"Why do you call me a dream?  Zenobia is much more like one than I; she\nis so very, very beautiful!  And, I suppose,\" added Priscilla, as if\nthinking aloud, \"everybody sees it, as I do.\"\n\nBut, for my part, it was Priscilla's beauty, not Zenobia's, of which I\nwas thinking at that moment.  She was a person who could be quite\nobliterated, so far as beauty went, by anything unsuitable in her\nattire; her charm was not positive and material enough to bear up\nagainst a mistaken choice of color, for instance, or fashion.  It was\nsafest, in her case, to attempt no art of dress; for it demanded the\nmost perfect taste, or else the happiest accident in the world, to give\nher precisely the adornment which she needed.  She was now dressed in\npure white, set off with some kind of a gauzy fabric, which--as I bring\nup her figure in my memory, with a faint gleam on her shadowy hair, and\nher dark eyes bent shyly on mine, through all the vanished years--seems\nto be floating about her like a mist.  I wondered what Zenobia meant by\nevolving so much loveliness out of this poor girl.  It was what few\nwomen could afford to do; for, as I looked from one to the other, the\nsheen and splendor of Zenobia's presence took nothing from Priscilla's\nsofter spell, if it might not rather be thought to add to it.\n\n\"What do you think of her?\" asked Zenobia.\n\nI could not understand the look of melancholy kindness with which\nZenobia regarded her.  She advanced a step, and beckoning Priscilla\nnear her, kissed her cheek; then, with a slight gesture of repulse, she\nmoved to the other side of the room.  I followed.\n\n\"She is a wonderful creature,\" I said.  \"Ever since she came among us,\nI have been dimly sensible of just this charm which you have brought\nout.  But it was never absolutely visible till now.  She is as lovely\nas a flower!\"\n\n\"Well, say so if you like,\" answered Zenobia.  \"You are a poet,--at\nleast, as poets go nowadays,--and must be allowed to make an\nopera-glass of your imagination, when you look at women.  I wonder, in\nsuch Arcadian freedom of falling in love as we have lately enjoyed, it\nnever occurred to you to fall in love with Priscilla.  In society,\nindeed, a genuine American never dreams of stepping across the\ninappreciable air-line which separates one class from another.  But\nwhat was rank to the colonists of Blithedale?\"\n\n\"There were other reasons,\" I replied, \"why I should have demonstrated\nmyself an ass, had I fallen in love with Priscilla.  By the bye, has\nHollingsworth ever seen her in this dress?\"\n\n\"Why do you bring up his name at every turn?\" asked Zenobia in an\nundertone, and with a malign look which wandered from my face to\nPriscilla's.  \"You know not what you do!  It is dangerous, sir, believe\nme, to tamper thus with earnest human passions, out of your own mere\nidleness, and for your sport.  I will endure it no longer!  Take care\nthat it does not happen again!  I warn you!\"\n\n\"You partly wrong me, if not wholly,\" I responded.  \"It is an uncertain\nsense of some duty to perform, that brings my thoughts, and therefore\nmy words, continually to that one point.\"\n\n\"Oh, this stale excuse of duty!\" said Zenobia, in a whisper so full of\nscorn that it penetrated me like the hiss of a serpent.  \"I have often\nheard it before, from those who sought to interfere with me, and I know\nprecisely what it signifies.  Bigotry; self-conceit; an insolent\ncuriosity; a meddlesome temper; a cold-blooded criticism, founded on a\nshallow interpretation of half-perceptions; a monstrous scepticism in\nregard to any conscience or any wisdom, except one's own; a most\nirreverent propensity to thrust Providence aside, and substitute one's\nself in its awful place,--out of these, and other motives as miserable\nas these, comes your idea of duty!  But, beware, sir!  With all your\nfancied acuteness, you step blindfold into these affairs.  For any\nmischief that may follow your interference, I hold you responsible!\"\n\nIt was evident that, with but a little further provocation, the lioness\nwould turn to bay; if, indeed, such were not her attitude already.  I\nbowed, and not very well knowing what else to do, was about to\nwithdraw.  But, glancing again towards Priscilla, who had retreated\ninto a corner, there fell upon my heart an intolerable burden of\ndespondency, the purport of which I could not tell, but only felt it to\nbear reference to her.  I approached and held out my hand; a gesture,\nhowever, to which she made no response.  It was always one of her\npeculiarities that she seemed to shrink from even the most friendly\ntouch, unless it were Zenobia's or Hollingsworth's. Zenobia, all this\nwhile, stood watching us, but with a careless expression, as if it\nmattered very little what might pass.\n\n\"Priscilla,\" I inquired, lowering my voice, \"when do you go back to\nBlithedale?\"\n\n\"Whenever they please to take me,\" said she.\n\n\"Did you come away of your own free will?\"  I asked.\n\n\"I am blown about like a leaf,\" she replied.  \"I never have any free\nwill.\"\n\n\"Does Hollingsworth know that you are here?\" said I.\n\n\"He bade me come,\" answered Priscilla.\n\nShe looked at me, I thought, with an air of surprise, as if the idea\nwere incomprehensible that she should have taken this step without his\nagency.\n\n\"What a gripe this man has laid upon her whole being!\" muttered I\nbetween my teeth.\n\n\"Well, as Zenobia so kindly intimates, I have no more business here. I\nwash my hands of it all.  On Hollingsworth's head be the consequences!\nPriscilla,\" I added aloud, \"I know not that ever we may meet again.\nFarewell!\"\n\nAs I spoke the word, a carriage had rumbled along the street, and stopt\nbefore the house.  The doorbell rang, and steps were immediately\nafterwards heard on the staircase.  Zenobia had thrown a shawl over her\ndress.\n\n\"Mr. Coverdale,\" said she, with cool courtesy, \"you will perhaps excuse\nus.  We have an engagement, and are going out.\"\n\n\"Whither?\"  I demanded.\n\n\"Is not that a little more than you are entitled to inquire?\" said she,\nwith a smile.  \"At all events, it does not suit me to tell you.\"\n\nThe door of the drawing-room opened, and Westervelt appeared.  I\nobserved that he was elaborately dressed, as if for some grand\nentertainment.  My dislike for this man was infinite.  At that moment\nit amounted to nothing less than a creeping of the flesh, as when,\nfeeling about in a dark place, one touches something cold and slimy,\nand questions what the secret hatefulness may be.  And still I could\nnot but acknowledge that, for personal beauty, for polish of manner,\nfor all that externally befits a gentleman, there was hardly another\nlike him.  After bowing to Zenobia, and graciously saluting Priscilla\nin her corner, he recognized me by a slight but courteous inclination.\n\n\"Come, Priscilla,\" said Zenobia; \"it is time.  Mr. Coverdale,\ngood-evening.\"\n\nAs Priscilla moved slowly forward, I met her in the middle of the\ndrawing-room.\n\n\"Priscilla,\" said I, in the hearing of them all, \"do you know whither\nyou are going?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" she answered.\n\n\"Is it wise to go, and is it your choice to go?\"  I asked.  \"If not, I\nam your friend, and Hollingsworth's friend.  Tell me so, at once.\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" observed Westervelt, smiling, \"Priscilla sees in me an\nolder friend than either Mr. Coverdale or Mr. Hollingsworth.  I shall\nwillingly leave the matter at her option.\"\n\nWhile thus speaking, he made a gesture of kindly invitation, and\nPriscilla passed me, with the gliding movement of a sprite, and took\nhis offered arm.  He offered the other to Zenobia; but she turned her\nproud and beautiful face upon him with a look which--judging from what\nI caught of it in profile--would undoubtedly have smitten the man dead,\nhad he possessed any heart, or had this glance attained to it.  It\nseemed to rebound, however, from his courteous visage, like an arrow\nfrom polished steel.  They all three descended the stairs; and when I\nlikewise reached the street door, the carriage was already rolling away.\n\n\n\nXXI. AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE\n\nThus excluded from everybody's confidence, and attaining no further, by\nmy most earnest study, than to an uncertain sense of something hidden\nfrom me, it would appear reasonable that I should have flung off all\nthese alien perplexities.  Obviously, my best course was to betake\nmyself to new scenes.  Here I was only an intruder.  Elsewhere there\nmight be circumstances in which I could establish a personal interest,\nand people who would respond, with a portion of their sympathies, for\nso much as I should bestow of mine.\n\nNevertheless, there occurred to me one other thing to be done.\nRemembering old Moodie, and his relationship with Priscilla, I\ndetermined to seek an interview, for the purpose of ascertaining\nwhether the knot of affairs was as inextricable on that side as I found\nit on all others.  Being tolerably well acquainted with the old man's\nhaunts, I went, the next day, to the saloon of a certain establishment\nabout which he often lurked.  It was a reputable place enough,\naffording good entertainment in the way of meat, drink, and fumigation;\nand there, in my young and idle days and nights, when I was neither\nnice nor wise, I had often amused myself with watching the staid humors\nand sober jollities of the thirsty souls around me.\n\nAt my first entrance, old Moodie was not there.  The more patiently to\nawait him, I lighted a cigar, and establishing myself in a corner, took\na quiet, and, by sympathy, a boozy kind of pleasure in the customary\nlife that was going forward.  The saloon was fitted up with a good deal\nof taste.  There were pictures on the walls, and among them an\noil-painting of a beefsteak, with such an admirable show of juicy\ntenderness, that the beholder sighed to think it merely visionary, and\nincapable of ever being put upon a gridiron.  Another work of high art\nwas the lifelike representation of a noble sirloin; another, the\nhindquarters of a deer, retaining the hoofs and tawny fur; another, the\nhead and shoulders of a salmon; and, still more exquisitely finished, a\nbrace of canvasback ducks, in which the mottled feathers were depicted\nwith the accuracy of a daguerreotype. Some very hungry painter, I\nsuppose, had wrought these subjects of still-life, heightening his\nimagination with his appetite, and earning, it is to be hoped, the\nprivilege of a daily dinner off whichever of his pictorial viands he\nliked best.\n\nThen there was a fine old cheese, in which you could almost discern the\nmites; and some sardines, on a small plate, very richly done, and\nlooking as if oozy with the oil in which they had been smothered. All\nthese things were so perfectly imitated, that you seemed to have the\ngenuine article before you, and yet with an indescribable, ideal charm;\nit took away the grossness from what was fleshiest and fattest, and\nthus helped the life of man, even in its earthliest relations, to\nappear rich and noble, as well as warm, cheerful, and substantial.\nThere were pictures, too, of gallant revellers, those of the old time,\nFlemish, apparently, with doublets and slashed sleeves, drinking their\nwine out of fantastic, long-stemmed glasses; quaffing joyously,\nquaffing forever, with inaudible laughter and song; while the champagne\nbubbled immortally against their moustaches, or the purple tide of\nBurgundy ran inexhaustibly down their throats.\n\nBut, in an obscure corner of the saloon, there was a little Picture\nexcellently done, moreover of a ragged, bloated, New England toper,\nstretched out on a bench, in the heavy, apoplectic sleep of\ndrunkenness.  The death-in-life was too well portrayed.  You smelt the\nfumy liquor that had brought on this syncope.  Your only comfort lay in\nthe forced reflection, that, real as he looked, the poor caitiff was\nbut imaginary, a bit of painted canvass, whom no delirium tremens, nor\nso much as a retributive headache, awaited, on the morrow.\n\nBy this time, it being past eleven o'clock, the two bar-keepers of the\nsaloon were in pretty constant activity.  One of these young men had a\nrare faculty in the concoction of gin-cocktails.  It was a spectacle to\nbehold, how, with a tumbler in each hand, he tossed the contents from\none to the other.  Never conveying it awry, nor spilling the least\ndrop, he compelled the frothy liquor, as it seemed to me, to spout\nforth from one glass and descend into the other, in a great parabolic\ncurve, as well-defined and calculable as a planet's orbit.  He had a\ngood forehead, with a particularly large development just above the\neyebrows; fine intellectual gifts, no doubt, which he had educated to\nthis profitable end; being famous for nothing but gin-cocktails, and\ncommanding a fair salary by his one accomplishment. These cocktails,\nand other artificial combinations of liquor, (of which there were at\nleast a score, though mostly, I suspect, fantastic in their\ndifferences,) were much in favor with the younger class of customers,\nwho, at farthest, had only reached the second stage of potatory life.\nThe staunch, old soakers, on the other hand men who, if put on tap,\nwould have yielded a red alcoholic liquor, by way of blood usually\nconfined themselves to plain brandy-and-water, gin, or West India rum;\nand, oftentimes, they prefaced their dram with some medicinal remark as\nto the wholesomeness and stomachic qualities of that particular drink.\nTwo or three appeared to have bottles of their own behind the counter;\nand, winking one red eye to the bar-keeper, he forthwith produced these\nchoicest and peculiar cordials, which it was a matter of great interest\nand favor, among their acquaintances, to obtain a sip of.\n\nAgreeably to the Yankee habit, under whatever circumstances, the\ndeportment of all these good fellows, old or young, was decorous and\nthoroughly correct.  They grew only the more sober in their cups; there\nwas no confused babble nor boisterous laughter.  They sucked in the\njoyous fire of the decanters and kept it smouldering in their inmost\nrecesses, with a bliss known only to the heart which it warmed and\ncomforted.  Their eyes twinkled a little, to be sure; they hemmed\nvigorously after each glass, and laid a hand upon the pit of the\nstomach, as if the pleasant titillation there was what constituted the\ntangible part of their enjoyment.  In that spot, unquestionably, and\nnot in the brain, was the acme of the whole affair.  But the true\npurpose of their drinking--and one that will induce men to drink, or do\nsomething equivalent, as long as this weary world shall endure--was the\nrenewed youth and vigor, the brisk, cheerful sense of things present\nand to come, with which, for about a quarter of an hour, the dram\npermeated their systems.  And when such quarters of an hour can be\nobtained in some mode less baneful to the great sum of a man's\nlife,--but, nevertheless, with a little spice of impropriety, to give\nit a wild flavor,--we temperance people may ring out our bells for\nvictory!\n\nThe prettiest object in the saloon was a tiny fountain, which threw up\nits feathery jet through the counter, and sparkled down again into an\noval basin, or lakelet, containing several goldfishes.  There was a bed\nof bright sand at the bottom, strewn with coral and rock-work; and the\nfishes went gleaming about, now turning up the sheen of a golden side,\nand now vanishing into the shadows of the water, like the fanciful\nthoughts that coquet with a poet in his dream.  Never before, I\nimagine, did a company of water-drinkers remain so entirely\nuncontaminated by the bad example around them; nor could I help\nwondering that it had not occurred to any freakish inebriate to empty a\nglass of liquor into their lakelet.  What a delightful idea!  Who would\nnot be a fish, if he could inhale jollity with the essential element of\nhis existence!\n\nI had begun to despair of meeting old Moodie, when, all at once, I\nrecognized his hand and arm protruding from behind a screen that was\nset up for the accommodation of bashful topers.  As a matter of course,\nhe had one of Priscilla's little purses, and was quietly insinuating it\nunder the notice of a person who stood near.  This was always old\nMoodie's way.  You hardly ever saw him advancing towards you, but\nbecame aware of his proximity without being able to guess how he had\ncome thither.  He glided about like a spirit, assuming visibility close\nto your elbow, offering his petty trifles of merchandise, remaining\nlong enough for you to purchase, if so disposed, and then taking\nhimself off, between two breaths, while you happened to be thinking of\nsomething else.\n\nBy a sort of sympathetic impulse that often controlled me in those more\nimpressible days of my life, I was induced to approach this old man in\na mode as undemonstrative as his own.  Thus, when, according to his\ncustom, he was probably just about to vanish, he found me at his elbow.\n\n\"Ah!\" said he, with more emphasis than was usual with him.  \"It is Mr.\nCoverdale!\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Moodie, your old acquaintance,\" answered I. \"It is some time\nnow since we ate luncheon together at Blithedale, and a good deal\nlonger since our little talk together at the street corner.\"\n\n\"That was a good while ago,\" said the old man.\n\nAnd he seemed inclined to say not a word more.  His existence looked so\ncolorless and torpid,--so very faintly shadowed on the canvas of\nreality,--that I was half afraid lest he should altogether disappear,\neven while my eyes were fixed full upon his figure.  He was certainly\nthe wretchedest old ghost in the world, with his crazy hat, the dingy\nhandkerchief about his throat, his suit of threadbare gray, and\nespecially that patch over his right eye, behind which he always seemed\nto be hiding himself.  There was one method, however, of bringing him\nout into somewhat stronger relief.  A glass of brandy would effect it.\nPerhaps the gentler influence of a bottle of claret might do the same.\nNor could I think it a matter for the recording angel to write down\nagainst me, if--with my painful consciousness of the frost in this old\nman's blood, and the positive ice that had congealed about his heart--I\nshould thaw him out, were it only for an hour, with the summer warmth\nof a little wine.  What else could possibly be done for him?  How else\ncould he be imbued with energy enough to hope for a happier state\nhereafter?  How else be inspired to say his prayers?  For there are\nstates of our spiritual system when the throb of the soul's life is too\nfaint and weak to render us capable of religious aspiration.\n\n\"Mr. Moodie,\" said I, \"shall we lunch together?  And would you like to\ndrink a glass of wine?\"\n\nHis one eye gleamed.  He bowed; and it impressed me that he grew to be\nmore of a man at once, either in anticipation of the wine, or as a\ngrateful response to my good fellowship in offering it.\n\n\"With pleasure,\" he replied.\n\nThe bar-keeper, at my request, showed us into a private room, and soon\nafterwards set some fried oysters and a bottle of claret on the table;\nand I saw the old man glance curiously at the label of the bottle, as\nif to learn the brand.\n\n\"It should be good wine,\" I remarked, \"if it have any right to its\nlabel.\"\n\n\"You cannot suppose, sir,\" said Moodie, with a sigh, \"that a poor old\nfellow like me knows any difference in wines.\"\n\nAnd yet, in his way of handling the glass, in his preliminary snuff at\nthe aroma, in his first cautious sip of the wine, and the gustatory\nskill with which he gave his palate the full advantage of it, it was\nimpossible not to recognize the connoisseur.\n\n\"I fancy, Mr. Moodie,\" said I, \"you are a much better judge of wines\nthan I have yet learned to be.  Tell me fairly,--did you never drink it\nwhere the grape grows?\"\n\n\"How should that have been, Mr. Coverdale?\" answered old Moodie shyly;\nbut then he took courage, as it were, and uttered a feeble little\nlaugh.  \"The flavor of this wine,\" added he, \"and its perfume still\nmore than its taste, makes me remember that I was once a young man.\"\n\n\"I wish, Mr. Moodie,\" suggested I,--not that I greatly cared about it,\nhowever, but was only anxious to draw him into some talk about\nPriscilla and Zenobia,--\"I wish, while we sit over our wine, you would\nfavor me with a few of those youthful reminiscences.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said he, shaking his head, \"they might interest you more than you\nsuppose.  But I had better be silent, Mr. Coverdale.  If this good\nwine,--though claret, I suppose, is not apt to play such a trick,--but\nif it should make my tongue run too freely, I could never look you in\nthe face again.\"\n\n\"You never did look me in the face, Mr. Moodie,\" I replied, \"until this\nvery moment.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" sighed old Moodie.\n\nIt was wonderful, however, what an effect the mild grape-juice wrought\nupon him.  It was not in the wine, but in the associations which it\nseemed to bring up.  Instead of the mean, slouching, furtive, painfully\ndepressed air of an old city vagabond, more like a gray kennel-rat than\nany other living thing, he began to take the aspect of a decayed\ngentleman.  Even his garments--especially after I had myself quaffed a\nglass or two--looked less shabby than when we first sat down.  There\nwas, by and by, a certain exuberance and elaborateness of gesture and\nmanner, oddly in contrast with all that I had hitherto seen of him.\nAnon, with hardly any impulse from me, old Moodie began to talk.  His\ncommunications referred exclusively to a long-past and more fortunate\nperiod of his life, with only a few unavoidable allusions to the\ncircumstances that had reduced him to his present state.  But, having\nonce got the clew, my subsequent researches acquainted me with the main\nfacts of the following narrative; although, in writing it out, my pen\nhas perhaps allowed itself a trifle of romantic and legendary license,\nworthier of a small poet than of a grave biographer.\n\n\n\nXXII. FAUNTLEROY\n\nFive-and-twenty years ago, at the epoch of this story, there dwelt in\none of the Middle States a man whom we shall call Fauntleroy; a man of\nwealth, and magnificent tastes, and prodigal expenditure.  His home\nmight almost be styled a palace; his habits, in the ordinary sense,\nprincely.  His whole being seemed to have crystallized itself into an\nexternal splendor, wherewith he glittered in the eyes of the world, and\nhad no other life than upon this gaudy surface.  He had married a\nlovely woman, whose nature was deeper than his own.  But his affection\nfor her, though it showed largely, was superficial, like all his other\nmanifestations and developments; he did not so truly keep this noble\ncreature in his heart, as wear her beauty for the most brilliant\nornament of his outward state.  And there was born to him a child, a\nbeautiful daughter, whom he took from the beneficent hand of God with\nno just sense of her immortal value, but as a man already rich in gems\nwould receive another jewel.  If he loved her, it was because she shone.\n\nAfter Fauntleroy had thus spent a few empty years, coruscating\ncontinually an unnatural light, the source of it--which was merely his\ngold--began to grow more shallow, and finally became exhausted. He saw\nhimself in imminent peril of losing all that had heretofore\ndistinguished him; and, conscious of no innate worth to fall back upon,\nhe recoiled from this calamity with the instinct of a soul shrinking\nfrom annihilation.  To avoid it,--wretched man!--or rather to defer it,\nif but for a month, a day, or only to procure himself the life of a few\nbreaths more amid the false glitter which was now less his own than\never,--he made himself guilty of a crime.  It was just the sort of\ncrime, growing out of its artificial state, which society (unless it\nshould change its entire constitution for this man's unworthy sake)\nneither could nor ought to pardon.  More safely might it pardon murder.\nFauntleroy's guilt was discovered.  He fled; his wife perished, by the\nnecessity of her innate nobleness, in its alliance with a being so\nignoble; and betwixt her mother's death and her father's ignominy, his\ndaughter was left worse than orphaned.\n\nThere was no pursuit after Fauntleroy.  His family connections, who had\ngreat wealth, made such arrangements with those whom he had attempted\nto wrong as secured him from the retribution that would have overtaken\nan unfriended criminal.  The wreck of his estate was divided among his\ncreditors: His name, in a very brief space, was forgotten by the\nmultitude who had passed it so diligently from mouth to mouth.  Seldom,\nindeed, was it recalled, even by his closest former intimates.  Nor\ncould it have been otherwise.  The man had laid no real touch on any\nmortal's heart.  Being a mere image, an optical delusion, created by\nthe sunshine of prosperity, it was his law to vanish into the shadow of\nthe first intervening cloud.  He seemed to leave no vacancy; a\nphenomenon which, like many others that attended his brief career, went\nfar to prove the illusiveness of his existence.\n\nNot, however, that the physical substance of Fauntleroy had literally\nmelted into vapor.  He had fled northward to the New England\nmetropolis, and had taken up his abode, under another name, in a\nsqualid street or court of the older portion of the city.  There he\ndwelt among poverty-stricken wretches, sinners, and forlorn good\npeople, Irish, and whomsoever else were neediest.  Many families were\nclustered in each house together, above stairs and below, in the little\npeaked garrets, and even in the dusky cellars.  The house where\nFauntleroy paid weekly rent for a chamber and a closet had been a\nstately habitation in its day.  An old colonial governor had built it,\nand lived there, long ago, and held his levees in a great room where\nnow slept twenty Irish bedfellows; and died in Fauntleroy's chamber,\nwhich his embroidered and white-wigged ghost still haunted. Tattered\nhangings, a marble hearth, traversed with many cracks and fissures, a\nrichly carved oaken mantelpiece, partly hacked away for kindling-stuff,\na stuccoed ceiling, defaced with great, unsightly patches of the naked\nlaths,--such was the chamber's aspect, as if, with its splinters and\nrags of dirty splendor, it were a kind of practical gibe at this poor,\nruined man of show.\n\nAt first, and at irregular intervals, his relatives allowed Fauntleroy\na little pittance to sustain life; not from any love, perhaps, but lest\npoverty should compel him, by new offences, to add more shame to that\nwith which he had already stained them.  But he showed no tendency to\nfurther guilt.  His character appeared to have been radically changed\n(as, indeed, from its shallowness, it well might) by his miserable\nfate; or, it may be, the traits now seen in him were portions of the\nsame character, presenting itself in another phase.  Instead of any\nlonger seeking to live in the sight of the world, his impulse was to\nshrink into the nearest obscurity, and to be unseen of men, were it\npossible, even while standing before their eyes.  He had no pride; it\nwas all trodden in the dust.  No ostentation; for how could it survive,\nwhen there was nothing left of Fauntleroy, save penury and shame!  His\nvery gait demonstrated that he would gladly have faded out of view, and\nhave crept about invisibly, for the sake of sheltering himself from the\nirksomeness of a human glance.  Hardly, it was averred, within the\nmemory of those who knew him now, had he the hardihood to show his full\nfront to the world.  He skulked in corners, and crept about in a sort\nof noonday twilight, making himself gray and misty, at all hours, with\nhis morbid intolerance of sunshine.\n\nIn his torpid despair, however, he had done an act which that condition\nof the spirit seems to prompt almost as often as prosperity and hope.\nFauntleroy was again married.  He had taken to wife a forlorn,\nmeek-spirited, feeble young woman, a seamstress, whom he found dwelling\nwith her mother in a contiguous chamber of the old gubernatorial\nresidence.  This poor phantom--as the beautiful and noble companion of\nhis former life had done brought him a daughter. And sometimes, as from\none dream into another, Fauntleroy looked forth out of his present\ngrimy environment into that past magnificence, and wondered whether the\ngrandee of yesterday or the pauper of to-day were real.  But, in my\nmind, the one and the other were alike impalpable.  In truth, it was\nFauntleroy's fatality to behold whatever he touched dissolve.  After a\nfew years, his second wife (dim shadow that she had always been) faded\nfinally out of the world, and left Fauntleroy to deal as he might with\ntheir pale and nervous child.  And, by this time, among his distant\nrelatives,--with whom he had grown a weary thought, linked with\ncontagious infamy, and which they were only too willing to get rid\nof,--he was himself supposed to be no more.\n\nThe younger child, like his elder one, might be considered as the true\noffspring of both parents, and as the reflection of their state. She\nwas a tremulous little creature, shrinking involuntarily from all\nmankind, but in timidity, and no sour repugnance.  There was a lack of\nhuman substance in her; it seemed as if, were she to stand up in a\nsunbeam, it would pass right through her figure, and trace out the\ncracked and dusty window-panes upon the naked floor.  But,\nnevertheless, the poor child had a heart; and from her mother's gentle\ncharacter she had inherited a profound and still capacity of affection.\nAnd so her life was one of love.  She bestowed it partly on her father,\nbut in greater part on an idea.\n\nFor Fauntleroy, as they sat by their cheerless fireside,--which was no\nfireside, in truth, but only a rusty stove,--had often talked to the\nlittle girl about his former wealth, the noble loveliness of his first\nwife, and the beautiful child whom she had given him.  Instead of the\nfairy tales which other parents tell, he told Priscilla this. And, out\nof the loneliness of her sad little existence, Priscilla's love grew,\nand tended upward, and twined itself perseveringly around this unseen\nsister; as a grapevine might strive to clamber out of a gloomy hollow\namong the rocks, and embrace a young tree standing in the sunny warmth\nabove.  It was almost like worship, both in its earnestness and its\nhumility; nor was it the less humble--though the more earnest--because\nPriscilla could claim human kindred with the being whom she, so\ndevoutly loved.  As with worship, too, it gave her soul the refreshment\nof a purer atmosphere.  Save for this singular, this melancholy, and\nyet beautiful affection, the child could hardly have lived; or, had she\nlived, with a heart shrunken for lack of any sentiment to fill it, she\nmust have yielded to the barren miseries of her position, and have\ngrown to womanhood characterless and worthless. But now, amid all the\nsombre coarseness of her father's outward life, and of her own,\nPriscilla had a higher and imaginative life within.  Some faint gleam\nthereof was often visible upon her face. It was as if, in her spiritual\nvisits to her brilliant sister, a portion of the latter's brightness\nhad permeated our dim Priscilla, and still lingered, shedding a faint\nillumination through the cheerless chamber, after she came back.\n\nAs the child grew up, so pallid and so slender, and with much\nunaccountable nervousness, and all the weaknesses of neglected infancy\nstill haunting her, the gross and simple neighbors whispered strange\nthings about Priscilla.  The big, red, Irish matrons, whose innumerable\nprogeny swarmed out of the adjacent doors, used to mock at the pale\nWestern child.  They fancied--or, at least, affirmed it, between jest\nand earnest--that she was not so solid flesh and blood as other\nchildren, but mixed largely with a thinner element.  They called her\nghost-child, and said that she could indeed vanish when she pleased,\nbut could never, in her densest moments, make herself quite visible.\nThe sun at midday would shine through her; in the first gray of the\ntwilight, she lost all the distinctness of her outline; and, if you\nfollowed the dim thing into a dark corner, behold! she was not there.\nAnd it was true that Priscilla had strange ways; strange ways, and\nstranger words, when she uttered any words at all.  Never stirring out\nof the old governor's dusky house, she sometimes talked of distant\nplaces and splendid rooms, as if she had just left them.  Hidden things\nwere visible to her (at least so the people inferred from obscure hints\nescaping unawares out of her mouth), and silence was audible.  And in\nall the world there was nothing so difficult to be endured, by those\nwho had any dark secret to conceal, as the glance of Priscilla's timid\nand melancholy eyes.\n\nHer peculiarities were the theme of continual gossip among the other\ninhabitants of the gubernatorial mansion.  The rumor spread thence into\na wider circle.  Those who knew old Moodie, as he was now called, used\noften to jeer him, at the very street-corners, about his daughter's\ngift of second-sight and prophecy.  It was a period when science\n(though mostly through its empirical professors) was bringing forward,\nanew, a hoard of facts and imperfect theories, that had partially won\ncredence in elder times, but which modern scepticism had swept away as\nrubbish.  These things were now tossed up again, out of the surging\nocean of human thought and experience.  The story of Priscilla's\npreternatural manifestations, therefore, attracted a kind of notice of\nwhich it would have been deemed wholly unworthy a few years earlier.\nOne day a gentleman ascended the creaking staircase, and inquired which\nwas old Moodie's chamber door.  And, several times, he came again.  He\nwas a marvellously handsome man,--still youthful, too, and fashionably\ndressed.  Except that Priscilla, in those days, had no beauty, and, in\nthe languor of her existence, had not yet blossomed into womanhood,\nthere would have been rich food for scandal in these visits; for the\ngirl was unquestionably their sole object, although her father was\nsupposed always to be present.  But, it must likewise be added, there\nwas something about Priscilla that calumny could not meddle with; and\nthus far was she privileged, either by the preponderance of what was\nspiritual, or the thin and watery blood that left her cheek so pallid.\n\nYet, if the busy tongues of the neighborhood spared Priscilla in one\nway, they made themselves amends by renewed and wilder babble on\nanother score.  They averred that the strange gentleman was a wizard,\nand that he had taken advantage of Priscilla's lack of earthly\nsubstance to subject her to himself, as his familiar spirit, through\nwhose medium he gained cognizance of whatever happened, in regions near\nor remote.  The boundaries of his power were defined by the verge of\nthe pit of Tartarus on the one hand, and the third sphere of the\ncelestial world on the other.  Again, they declared their suspicion\nthat the wizard, with all his show of manly beauty, was really an aged\nand wizened figure, or else that his semblance of a human body was only\na necromantic, or perhaps a mechanical contrivance, in which a demon\nwalked about.  In proof of it, however, they could merely instance a\ngold band around his upper teeth, which had once been visible to\nseveral old women, when he smiled at them from the top of the\ngovernor's staircase.  Of course this was all absurdity, or mostly so.\nBut, after every possible deduction, there remained certain very\nmysterious points about the stranger's character, as well as the\nconnection that he established with Priscilla.  Its nature at that\nperiod was even less understood than now, when miracles of this kind\nhave grown so absolutely stale, that I would gladly, if the truth\nallowed, dismiss the whole matter from my narrative.\n\nWe must now glance backward, in quest of the beautiful daughter of\nFauntleroy's prosperity.  What had become of her?  Fauntleroy's only\nbrother, a bachelor, and with no other relative so near, had adopted\nthe forsaken child.  She grew up in affluence, with native graces\nclustering luxuriantly about her.  In her triumphant progress towards\nwomanhood, she was adorned with every variety of feminine\naccomplishment.  But she lacked a mother's care.  With no adequate\ncontrol, on any hand (for a man, however stern, however wise, can never\nsway and guide a female child), her character was left to shape itself.\nThere was good in it, and evil.  Passionate, self-willed, and\nimperious, she had a warm and generous nature; showing the richness of\nthe soil, however, chiefly by the weeds that flourished in it, and\nchoked up the herbs of grace.  In her girlhood her uncle died.  As\nFauntleroy was supposed to be likewise dead, and no other heir was\nknown to exist, his wealth devolved on her, although, dying suddenly,\nthe uncle left no will.  After his death there were obscure passages in\nZenobia's history.  There were whispers of an attachment, and even a\nsecret marriage, with a fascinating and accomplished but unprincipled\nyoung man.  The incidents and appearances, however, which led to this\nsurmise soon passed away, and were forgotten.\n\nNor was her reputation seriously affected by the report.  In fact, so\ngreat was her native power and influence, and such seemed the careless\npurity of her nature, that whatever Zenobia did was generally\nacknowledged as right for her to do.  The world never criticised her so\nharshly as it does most women who transcend its rules.  It almost\nyielded its assent, when it beheld her stepping out of the common path,\nand asserting the more extensive privileges of her sex, both\ntheoretically and by her practice.  The sphere of ordinary womanhood\nwas felt to be narrower than her development required.\n\nA portion of Zenobia's more recent life is told in the foregoing pages.\nPartly in earnest,--and, I imagine, as was her disposition, half in a\nproud jest, or in a kind of recklessness that had grown upon her, out\nof some hidden grief,--she had given her countenance, and promised\nliberal pecuniary aid, to our experiment of a better social state.  And\nPriscilla followed her to Blithedale.  The sole bliss of her life had\nbeen a dream of this beautiful sister, who had never so much as known\nof her existence.  By this time, too, the poor girl was enthralled in\nan intolerable bondage, from which she must either free herself or\nperish.  She deemed herself safest near Zenobia, into whose large heart\nshe hoped to nestle.\n\nOne evening, months after Priscilla's departure, when Moodie (or shall\nwe call him Fauntleroy?) was sitting alone in the state-chamber of the\nold governor, there came footsteps up the staircase.  There was a pause\non the landing-place.  A lady's musical yet haughty accents were heard\nmaking an inquiry from some denizen of the house, who had thrust a head\nout of a contiguous chamber.  There was then a knock at Moodie's door.\n\"Come in!\" said he.\n\nAnd Zenobia entered.  The details of the interview that followed being\nunknown to me,--while, notwithstanding, it would be a pity quite to\nlose the picturesqueness of the situation,--I shall attempt to sketch\nit, mainly from fancy, although with some general grounds of surmise in\nregard to the old man's feelings.\n\nShe gazed wonderingly at the dismal chamber.  Dismal to her, who beheld\nit only for an instant; and how much more so to him, into whose brain\neach bare spot on the ceiling, every tatter of the paper-hangings, and\nall the splintered carvings of the mantelpiece, seen wearily through\nlong years, had worn their several prints! Inexpressibly miserable is\nthis familiarity with objects that have been from the first disgustful.\n\n\"I have received a strange message,\" said Zenobia, after a moment's\nsilence, \"requesting, or rather enjoining it upon me, to come hither.\nRather from curiosity than any other motive,--and because, though a\nwoman, I have not all the timidity of one,--I have complied.  Can it be\nyou, sir, who thus summoned me?\"\n\n\"It was,\" answered Moodie.\n\n\"And what was your purpose?\" she continued.  \"You require charity,\nperhaps?  In that case, the message might have been more fitly worded.\nBut you are old and poor, and age and poverty should be allowed their\nprivileges.  Tell me, therefore, to what extent you need my aid.\"\n\n\"Put up your purse,\" said the supposed mendicant, with an inexplicable\nsmile.  \"Keep it,--keep all your wealth,--until I demand it all, or\nnone!  My message had no such end in view.  You are beautiful, they\ntell me; and I desired to look at you.\"\n\nHe took the one lamp that showed the discomfort and sordidness of his\nabode, and approaching Zenobia held it up, so as to gain the more\nperfect view of her, from top to toe.  So obscure was the chamber, that\nyou could see the reflection of her diamonds thrown upon the dingy\nwall, and flickering with the rise and fall of Zenobia's breath. It was\nthe splendor of those jewels on her neck, like lamps that burn before\nsome fair temple, and the jewelled flower in her hair, more than the\nmurky, yellow light, that helped him to see her beauty. But he beheld\nit, and grew proud at heart; his own figure, in spite of his mean\nhabiliments, assumed an air of state and grandeur.\n\n\"It is well,\" cried old Moodie.  \"Keep your wealth.  You are right\nworthy of it.  Keep it, therefore, but with one condition only.\"\n\nZenobia thought the old man beside himself, and was moved with pity.\n\n\"Have you none to care for you?\" asked she.  \"No daughter?--no\nkind-hearted neighbor?--no means of procuring the attendance which you\nneed?  Tell me once again, can I do nothing for you?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" he replied.  \"I have beheld what I wished.  Now leave me.\nLinger not a moment longer, or I may be tempted to say what would bring\na cloud over that queenly brow.  Keep all your wealth, but with only\nthis one condition: Be kind--be no less kind than sisters are--to my\npoor Priscilla!\"\n\nAnd, it may be, after Zenobia withdrew, Fauntleroy paced his gloomy\nchamber, and communed with himself as follows,--or, at all events, it\nis the only solution which I can offer of the enigma presented in his\ncharacter:--\"I am unchanged,--the same man as of yore!\" said he. \"True,\nmy brother's wealth--he dying intestate--is legally my own.  I know it;\nyet of my own choice, I live a beggar, and go meanly clad, and hide\nmyself behind a forgotten ignominy.  Looks this like ostentation?  Ah!\nbut in Zenobia I live again!  Beholding her, so beautiful,--so fit to\nbe adorned with all imaginable splendor of outward state,--the cursed\nvanity, which, half a lifetime since, dropt off like tatters of once\ngaudy apparel from my debased and ruined person, is all renewed for her\nsake.  Were I to reappear, my shame would go with me from darkness into\ndaylight.  Zenobia has the splendor, and not the shame.  Let the world\nadmire her, and be dazzled by her, the brilliant child of my\nprosperity!  It is Fauntleroy that still shines through her!\"  But\nthen, perhaps, another thought occurred to him.\n\n\"My poor Priscilla!  And am I just to her, in surrendering all to this\nbeautiful Zenobia?  Priscilla!  I love her best,--I love her only!--but\nwith shame, not pride.  So dim, so pallid, so shrinking,--the daughter\nof my long calamity!  Wealth were but a mockery in Priscilla's hands.\nWhat is its use, except to fling a golden radiance around those who\ngrasp it?  Yet let Zenobia take heed! Priscilla shall have no wrong!\"\nBut, while the man of show thus meditated,--that very evening, so far\nas I can adjust the dates of these strange incidents,--Priscilla poor,\npallid flower!--was either snatched from Zenobia's hand, or flung\nwilfully away!\n\n\n\nXXIII. A VILLAGE HALL\n\nWell, I betook myself away, and wandered up and down, like an exorcised\nspirit that had been driven from its old haunts after a mighty\nstruggle.  It takes down the solitary pride of man, beyond most other\nthings, to find the impracticability of flinging aside affections that\nhave grown irksome.  The bands that were silken once are apt to become\niron fetters when we desire to shake them off.  Our souls, after all,\nare not our own.  We convey a property in them to those with whom we\nassociate; but to what extent can never be known, until we feel the\ntug, the agony, of our abortive effort to resume an exclusive sway over\nourselves.  Thus, in all the weeks of my absence, my thoughts\ncontinually reverted back, brooding over the bygone months, and\nbringing up incidents that seemed hardly to have left a trace of\nthemselves in their passage.  I spent painful hours in recalling these\ntrifles, and rendering them more misty and unsubstantial than at first\nby the quantity of speculative musing thus kneaded in with them.\nHollingsworth, Zenobia, Priscilla!  These three had absorbed my life\ninto themselves.  Together with an inexpressible longing to know their\nfortunes, there was likewise a morbid resentment of my own pain, and a\nstubborn reluctance to come again within their sphere.\n\nAll that I learned of them, therefore, was comprised in a few brief and\npungent squibs, such as the newspapers were then in the habit of\nbestowing on our socialist enterprise.  There was one paragraph, which\nif I rightly guessed its purport bore reference to Zenobia, but was too\ndarkly hinted to convey even thus much of certainty. Hollingsworth,\ntoo, with his philanthropic project, afforded the penny-a-liners a\ntheme for some savage and bloody minded jokes; and, considerably to my\nsurprise, they affected me with as much indignation as if we had still\nbeen friends.\n\nThus passed several weeks; time long enough for my brown and\ntoil-hardened hands to reaccustom themselves to gloves.  Old habits,\nsuch as were merely external, returned upon me with wonderful\npromptitude.  My superficial talk, too, assumed altogether a worldly\ntone.  Meeting former acquaintances, who showed themselves inclined to\nridicule my heroic devotion to the cause of human welfare, I spoke of\nthe recent phase of my life as indeed fair matter for a jest.  But, I\nalso gave them to understand that it was, at most, only an experiment,\non which I had staked no valuable amount of hope or fear. It had\nenabled me to pass the summer in a novel and agreeable way, had\nafforded me some grotesque specimens of artificial simplicity, and\ncould not, therefore, so far as I was concerned, be reckoned a failure.\nIn no one instance, however, did I voluntarily speak of my three\nfriends.  They dwelt in a profounder region.  The more I consider\nmyself as I then was, the more do I recognize how deeply my connection\nwith those three had affected all my being.\n\nAs it was already the epoch of annihilated space, I might in the time I\nwas away from Blithedale have snatched a glimpse at England, and been\nback again.  But my wanderings were confined within a very limited\nsphere.  I hopped and fluttered, like a bird with a string about its\nleg, gyrating round a small circumference, and keeping up a restless\nactivity to no purpose.  Thus it was still in our familiar\nMassachusetts--in one of its white country villages--that I must next\nparticularize an incident.\n\nThe scene was one of those lyceum halls, of which almost every village\nhas now its own, dedicated to that sober and pallid, or rather\ndrab-colored, mode of winter-evening entertainment, the lecture.  Of\nlate years this has come strangely into vogue, when the natural\ntendency of things would seem to be to substitute lettered for oral\nmethods of addressing the public.  But, in halls like this, besides the\nwinter course of lectures, there is a rich and varied series of other\nexhibitions.  Hither comes the ventriloquist, with all his mysterious\ntongues; the thaumaturgist, too, with his miraculous transformations of\nplates, doves, and rings, his pancakes smoking in your hat, and his\ncellar of choice liquors represented in one small bottle.  Here, also,\nthe itinerant professor instructs separate classes of ladies and\ngentlemen in physiology, and demonstrates his lessons by the aid of\nreal skeletons, and manikins in wax, from Paris.  Here is to be heard\nthe choir of Ethiopian melodists, and to be seen the diorama of Moscow\nor Bunker Hill, or the moving panorama of the Chinese wall.  Here is\ndisplayed the museum of wax figures, illustrating the wide catholicism\nof earthly renown, by mixing up heroes and statesmen, the pope and the\nMormon prophet, kings, queens, murderers, and beautiful ladies; every\nsort of person, in short, except authors, of whom I never beheld even\nthe most famous done in wax.  And here, in this many-purposed hall\n(unless the selectmen of the village chance to have more than their\nshare of the Puritanism, which, however diversified with later\npatchwork, still gives its prevailing tint to New England\ncharacter),--here the company of strolling players sets up its little\nstage, and claims patronage for the legitimate drama.\n\nBut, on the autumnal evening which I speak of, a number of printed\nhandbills--stuck up in the bar-room, and on the sign-post of the hotel,\nand on the meeting-house porch, and distributed largely through the\nvillage--had promised the inhabitants an interview with that celebrated\nand hitherto inexplicable phenomenon, the Veiled Lady!\n\nThe hall was fitted up with an amphitheatrical descent of seats towards\na platform, on which stood a desk, two lights, a stool, and a capacious\nantique chair.  The audience was of a generally decent and respectable\ncharacter: old farmers, in their Sunday black coats, with shrewd, hard,\nsun-dried faces, and a cynical humor, oftener than any other\nexpression, in their eyes; pretty girls, in many-colored attire; pretty\nyoung men,--the schoolmaster, the lawyer, or student at law, the\nshop-keeper,--all looking rather suburban than rural.  In these days,\nthere is absolutely no rusticity, except when the actual labor of the\nsoil leaves its earth-mould on the person.  There was likewise a\nconsiderable proportion of young and middle-aged women, many of them\nstern in feature, with marked foreheads, and a very definite line of\neyebrow; a type of womanhood in which a bold intellectual development\nseems to be keeping pace with the progressive delicacy of the physical\nconstitution.  Of all these people I took note, at first, according to\nmy custom.  But I ceased to do so the moment that my eyes fell on an\nindividual who sat two or three seats below me, immovable, apparently\ndeep in thought, with his back, of course, towards me, and his face\nturned steadfastly upon the platform.\n\nAfter sitting awhile in contemplation of this person's familiar\ncontour, I was irresistibly moved to step over the intervening benches,\nlay my hand on his shoulder, put my mouth close to his ear, and address\nhim in a sepulchral, melodramatic whisper: \"Hollingsworth! where have\nyou left Zenobia?\"\n\nHis nerves, however, were proof against my attack.  He turned half\naround, and looked me in the face with great sad eyes, in which there\nwas neither kindness nor resentment, nor any perceptible surprise.\n\n\"Zenobia, when I last saw her,\" he answered, \"was at Blithedale.\"\n\nHe said no more.  But there was a great deal of talk going on near me,\namong a knot of people who might be considered as representing the\nmysticism, or rather the mystic sensuality, of this singular age. The\nnature of the exhibition that was about to take place had probably\ngiven the turn to their conversation.\n\nI heard, from a pale man in blue spectacles, some stranger stories than\never were written in a romance; told, too, with a simple, unimaginative\nsteadfastness, which was terribly efficacious in compelling the auditor\nto receive them into the category of established facts.  He cited\ninstances of the miraculous power of one human being over the will and\npassions of another; insomuch that settled grief was but a shadow\nbeneath the influence of a man possessing this potency, and the strong\nlove of years melted away like a vapor.  At the bidding of one of these\nwizards, the maiden, with her lover's kiss still burning on her lips,\nwould turn from him with icy indifference; the newly made widow would\ndig up her buried heart out of her young husband's grave before the\nsods had taken root upon it; a mother with her babe's milk in her bosom\nwould thrust away her child.  Human character was but soft wax in his\nhands; and guilt, or virtue, only the forms into which he should see\nfit to mould it. The religious sentiment was a flame which he could\nblow up with his breath, or a spark that he could utterly extinguish.\nIt is unutterable, the horror and disgust with which I listened, and\nsaw that, if these things were to be believed, the individual soul was\nvirtually annihilated, and all that is sweet and pure in our present\nlife debased, and that the idea of man's eternal responsibility was\nmade ridiculous, and immortality rendered at once impossible, and not\nworth acceptance.  But I would have perished on the spot sooner than\nbelieve it.\n\nThe epoch of rapping spirits, and all the wonders that have followed in\ntheir train,--such as tables upset by invisible agencies, bells\nself-tolled at funerals, and ghostly music performed on\njew's-harps,--had not yet arrived.  Alas, my countrymen, methinks we\nhave fallen on an evil age!  If these phenomena have not humbug at the\nbottom, so much the worse for us.  What can they indicate, in a\nspiritual way, except that the soul of man is descending to a lower\npoint than it has ever before reached while incarnate?  We are pursuing\na downward course in the eternal march, and thus bring ourselves into\nthe same range with beings whom death, in requital of their gross and\nevil lives, has degraded below humanity!  To hold intercourse with\nspirits of this order, we must stoop and grovel in some element more\nvile than earthly dust.  These goblins, if they exist at all, are but\nthe shadows of past mortality, outcasts, mere refuse stuff, adjudged\nunworthy of the eternal world, and, on the most favorable supposition,\ndwindling gradually into nothingness.  The less we have to say to them\nthe better, lest we share their fate!\n\nThe audience now began to be impatient; they signified their desire for\nthe entertainment to commence by thump of sticks and stamp of\nboot-heels.  Nor was it a great while longer before, in response to\ntheir call, there appeared a bearded personage in Oriental robes,\nlooking like one of the enchanters of the Arabian Nights.  He came upon\nthe platform from a side door, saluted the spectators, not with a\nsalaam, but a bow, took his station at the desk, and first blowing his\nnose with a white handkerchief, prepared to speak.  The environment of\nthe homely village hall, and the absence of many ingenious contrivances\nof stage effect with which the exhibition had heretofore been set off,\nseemed to bring the artifice of this character more openly upon the\nsurface.  No sooner did I behold the bearded enchanter, than, laying my\nhand again on Hollingsworth's shoulder, I whispered in his ear, \"Do you\nknow him?\"\n\n\"I never saw the man before,\" he muttered, without turning his head.\n\nBut I had seen him three times already.\n\nOnce, on occasion of my first visit to the Veiled Lady; a second time,\nin the wood-path at Blithedale; and lastly, in Zenobia's drawing-room.\nIt was Westervelt.  A quick association of ideas made me shudder from\nhead to foot; and again, like an evil spirit, bringing up reminiscences\nof a man's sins, I whispered a question in Hollingsworth's ear,--\"What\nhave you done with Priscilla?\"\n\nHe gave a convulsive start, as if I had thrust a knife into him,\nwrithed himself round on his seat, glared fiercely into my eyes, but\nanswered not a word.\n\nThe Professor began his discourse, explanatory of the psychological\nphenomena, as he termed them, which it was his purpose to exhibit to\nthe spectators.  There remains no very distinct impression of it on my\nmemory.  It was eloquent, ingenious, plausible, with a delusive show of\nspirituality, yet really imbued throughout with a cold and dead\nmaterialism.  I shivered, as at a current of chill air issuing out of a\nsepulchral vault, and bringing the smell of corruption along with it.\nHe spoke of a new era that was dawning upon the world; an era that\nwould link soul to soul, and the present life to what we call futurity,\nwith a closeness that should finally convert both worlds into one\ngreat, mutually conscious brotherhood.  He described (in a strange,\nphilosophical guise, with terms of art, as if it were a matter of\nchemical discovery) the agency by which this mighty result was to be\neffected; nor would it have surprised me, had he pretended to hold up a\nportion of his universally pervasive fluid, as he affirmed it to be, in\na glass phial.\n\nAt the close of his exordium, the Professor beckoned with his\nhand,--once, twice, thrice,--and a figure came gliding upon the\nplatform, enveloped in a long veil of silvery whiteness.  It fell about\nher like the texture of a summer cloud, with a kind of vagueness, so\nthat the outline of the form beneath it could not be accurately\ndiscerned. But the movement of the Veiled Lady was graceful, free, and\nunembarrassed, like that of a person accustomed to be the spectacle of\nthousands; or, possibly, a blindfold prisoner within the sphere with\nwhich this dark earthly magician had surrounded her, she was wholly\nunconscious of being the central object to all those straining eyes.\n\nPliant to his gesture (which had even an obsequious courtesy, but at\nthe same time a remarkable decisiveness), the figure placed itself in\nthe great chair.  Sitting there, in such visible obscurity, it was,\nperhaps, as much like the actual presence of a disembodied spirit as\nanything that stage trickery could devise.  The hushed breathing of the\nspectators proved how high-wrought were their anticipations of the\nwonders to be performed through the medium of this incomprehensible\ncreature.  I, too, was in breathless suspense, but with a far different\npresentiment of some strange event at hand.\n\n\"You see before you the Veiled Lady,\" said the bearded Professor,\nadvancing to the verge of the platform.  \"By the agency of which I have\njust spoken, she is at this moment in communion with the spiritual\nworld.  That silvery veil is, in one sense, an enchantment, having been\ndipped, as it were, and essentially imbued, through the potency of my\nart, with the fluid medium of spirits.  Slight and ethereal as it\nseems, the limitations of time and space have no existence within its\nfolds.  This hall--these hundreds of faces, encompassing her within so\nnarrow an amphitheatre--are of thinner substance, in her view, than the\nairiest vapor that the clouds are made of.  She beholds the Absolute!\"\n\nAs preliminary to other and far more wonderful psychological\nexperiments, the exhibitor suggested that some of his auditors should\nendeavor to make the Veiled Lady sensible of their presence by such\nmethods--provided only no touch were laid upon her person--as they\nmight deem best adapted to that end.  Accordingly, several deep-lunged\ncountry fellows, who looked as if they might have blown the apparition\naway with a breath, ascended the platform.  Mutually encouraging one\nanother, they shouted so close to her ear that the veil stirred like a\nwreath of vanishing mist; they smote upon the floor with bludgeons;\nthey perpetrated so hideous a clamor, that methought it might have\nreached, at least, a little way into the eternal sphere.  Finally, with\nthe assent of the Professor, they laid hold of the great chair, and\nwere startled, apparently, to find it soar upward, as if lighter than\nthe air through which it rose.  But the Veiled Lady remained seated and\nmotionless, with a composure that was hardly less than awful, because\nimplying so immeasurable a distance betwixt her and these rude\npersecutors.\n\n\"These efforts are wholly without avail,\" observed the Professor, who\nhad been looking on with an aspect of serene indifference.  \"The roar\nof a battery of cannon would be inaudible to the Veiled Lady.  And yet,\nwere I to will it, sitting in this very hall, she could hear the desert\nwind sweeping over the sands as far off as Arabia; the icebergs\ngrinding one against the other in the polar seas; the rustle of a leaf\nin an East Indian forest; the lowest whispered breath of the\nbashfullest maiden in the world, uttering the first confession of her\nlove.  Nor does there exist the moral inducement, apart from my own\nbehest, that could persuade her to lift the silvery veil, or arise out\nof that chair.\"\n\nGreatly to the Professor's discomposure, however, just as he spoke\nthese words, the Veiled Lady arose.  There was a mysterious tremor that\nshook the magic veil.  The spectators, it may be, imagined that she was\nabout to take flight into that invisible sphere, and to the society of\nthose purely spiritual beings with whom they reckoned her so near akin.\nHollingsworth, a moment ago, had mounted the platform, and now stood\ngazing at the figure, with a sad intentness that brought the whole\npower of his great, stern, yet tender soul into his glance.\n\n\"Come,\" said he, waving his hand towards her.  \"You are safe!\"\n\nShe threw off the veil, and stood before that multitude of people pale,\ntremulous, shrinking, as if only then had she discovered that a\nthousand eyes were gazing at her.  Poor maiden!  How strangely had she\nbeen betrayed!  Blazoned abroad as a wonder of the world, and\nperforming what were adjudged as miracles,--in the faith of many, a\nseeress and a prophetess; in the harsher judgment of others, a\nmountebank,--she had kept, as I religiously believe, her virgin reserve\nand sanctity of soul throughout it all.  Within that encircling veil,\nthough an evil hand had flung it over her, there was as deep a\nseclusion as if this forsaken girl had, all the while, been sitting\nunder the shadow of Eliot's pulpit, in the Blithedale woods, at the\nfeet of him who now summoned her to the shelter of his arms. And the\ntrue heart-throb of a woman's affection was too powerful for the\njugglery that had hitherto environed her.  She uttered a shriek, and\nfled to Hollingsworth, like one escaping from her deadliest enemy, and\nwas safe forever.\n\n\n\nXXIV. THE MASQUERADERS\n\nTwo nights had passed since the foregoing occurrences, when, in a\nbreezy September forenoon, I set forth from town, on foot, towards\nBlithedale.  It was the most delightful of all days for a walk, with a\ndash of invigorating ice-temper in the air, but a coolness that soon\ngave place to the brisk glow of exercise, while the vigor remained as\nelastic as before.  The atmosphere had a spirit and sparkle in it.\nEach breath was like a sip of ethereal wine, tempered, as I said, with\na crystal lump of ice.  I had started on this expedition in an\nexceedingly sombre mood, as well befitted one who found himself tending\ntowards home, but was conscious that nobody would be quite overjoyed to\ngreet him there.  My feet were hardly off the pavement, however, when\nthis morbid sensation began to yield to the lively influences of air\nand motion.  Nor had I gone far, with fields yet green on either side,\nbefore my step became as swift and light as if Hollingsworth were\nwaiting to exchange a friendly hand-grip, and Zenobia's and Priscilla's\nopen arms would welcome the wanderer's reappearance.  It has happened\nto me on other occasions, as well as this, to prove how a state of\nphysical well-being can create a kind of joy, in spite of the\nprofoundest anxiety of mind.\n\nThe pathway of that walk still runs along, with sunny freshness,\nthrough my memory.  I know not why it should be so.  But my mental eye\ncan even now discern the September grass, bordering the pleasant\nroadside with a brighter verdure than while the summer heats were\nscorching it; the trees, too, mostly green, although here and there a\nbranch or shrub has donned its vesture of crimson and gold a week or\ntwo before its fellows.  I see the tufted barberry-bushes, with their\nsmall clusters of scarlet fruit; the toadstools, likewise,--some\nspotlessly white, others yellow or red,--mysterious growths, springing\nsuddenly from no root or seed, and growing nobody can tell how or\nwherefore.  In this respect they resembled many of the emotions in my\nbreast.  And I still see the little rivulets, chill, clear, and bright,\nthat murmured beneath the road, through subterranean rocks, and\ndeepened into mossy pools, where tiny fish were darting to and fro, and\nwithin which lurked the hermit frog. But no,--I never can account for\nit, that, with a yearning interest to learn the upshot of all my story,\nand returning to Blithedale for that sole purpose, I should examine\nthese things so like a peaceful-bosomed naturalist.  Nor why, amid all\nmy sympathies and fears, there shot, at times, a wild exhilaration\nthrough my frame.\n\nThus I pursued my way along the line of the ancient stone wall that\nPaul Dudley built, and through white villages, and past orchards of\nruddy apples, and fields of ripening maize, and patches of woodland,\nand all such sweet rural scenery as looks the fairest, a little beyond\nthe suburbs of a town.  Hollingsworth, Zenobia, Priscilla! They glided\nmistily before me, as I walked.  Sometimes, in my solitude, I laughed\nwith the bitterness of self-scorn, remembering how unreservedly I had\ngiven up my heart and soul to interests that were not mine.  What had I\never had to do with them?  And why, being now free, should I take this\nthraldom on me once again?  It was both sad and dangerous, I whispered\nto myself, to be in too close affinity with the passions, the errors,\nand the misfortunes of individuals who stood within a circle of their\nown, into which, if I stept at all, it must be as an intruder, and at a\nperil that I could not estimate.\n\nDrawing nearer to Blithedale, a sickness of the spirits kept\nalternating with my flights of causeless buoyancy.  I indulged in a\nhundred odd and extravagant conjectures.  Either there was no such\nplace as Blithedale, nor ever had been, nor any brotherhood of\nthoughtful laborers, like what I seemed to recollect there, or else it\nwas all changed during my absence.  It had been nothing but dream work\nand enchantment.  I should seek in vain for the old farmhouse, and for\nthe greensward, the potato-fields, the root-crops, and acres of Indian\ncorn, and for all that configuration of the land which I had imagined.\nIt would be another spot, and an utter strangeness.\n\nThese vagaries were of the spectral throng so apt to steal out of an\nunquiet heart.  They partly ceased to haunt me, on my arriving at a\npoint whence, through the trees, I began to catch glimpses of the\nBlithedale farm.  That surely was something real.  There was hardly a\nsquare foot of all those acres on which I had not trodden heavily, in\none or another kind of toil.  The curse of Adam's posterity--and, curse\nor blessing be it, it gives substance to the life around us--had first\ncome upon me there.  In the sweat of my brow I had there earned bread\nand eaten it, and so established my claim to be on earth, and my\nfellowship with all the sons of labor.  I could have knelt down, and\nhave laid my breast against that soil.  The red clay of which my frame\nwas moulded seemed nearer akin to those crumbling furrows than to any\nother portion of the world's dust.  There was my home, and there might\nbe my grave.\n\nI felt an invincible reluctance, nevertheless, at the idea of\npresenting myself before my old associates, without first ascertaining\nthe state in which they were.  A nameless foreboding weighed upon me.\nPerhaps, should I know all the circumstances that had occurred, I might\nfind it my wisest course to turn back, unrecognized, unseen, and never\nlook at Blithedale more.  Had it been evening, I would have stolen\nsoftly to some lighted window of the old farmhouse, and peeped darkling\nin, to see all their well-known faces round the supper-board.  Then,\nwere there a vacant seat, I might noiselessly unclose the door, glide\nin, and take my place among them, without a word.  My entrance might be\nso quiet, my aspect so familiar, that they would forget how long I had\nbeen away, and suffer me to melt into the scene, as a wreath of vapor\nmelts into a larger cloud. I dreaded a boisterous greeting.  Beholding\nme at table, Zenobia, as a matter of course, would send me a cup of\ntea, and Hollingsworth fill my plate from the great dish of pandowdy,\nand Priscilla, in her quiet way, would hand the cream, and others help\nme to the bread and butter.  Being one of them again, the knowledge of\nwhat had happened would come to me without a shock.  For still, at\nevery turn of my shifting fantasies, the thought stared me in the face\nthat some evil thing had befallen us, or was ready to befall.\n\nYielding to this ominous impression, I now turned aside into the woods,\nresolving to spy out the posture of the Community as craftily as the\nwild Indian before he makes his onset.  I would go wandering about the\noutskirts of the farm, and, perhaps, catching sight of a solitary\nacquaintance, would approach him amid the brown shadows of the trees (a\nkind of medium fit for spirits departed and revisitant, like myself),\nand entreat him to tell me how all things were.\n\nThe first living creature that I met was a partridge, which sprung up\nbeneath my feet, and whirred away; the next was a squirrel, who\nchattered angrily at me from an overhanging bough.  I trod along by the\ndark, sluggish river, and remember pausing on the bank, above one of\nits blackest and most placid pools (the very spot, with the barkless\nstump of a tree aslantwise over the water, is depicting itself to my\nfancy at this instant), and wondering how deep it was, and if any\noverladen soul had ever flung its weight of mortality in thither, and\nif it thus escaped the burden, or only made it heavier. And perhaps the\nskeleton of the drowned wretch still lay beneath the inscrutable depth,\nclinging to some sunken log at the bottom with the gripe of its old\ndespair.  So slight, however, was the track of these gloomy ideas, that\nI soon forgot them in the contemplation of a brood of wild ducks, which\nwere floating on the river, and anon took flight, leaving each a bright\nstreak over the black surface.  By and by, I came to my hermitage, in\nthe heart of the white-pine tree, and clambering up into it, sat down\nto rest.  The grapes, which I had watched throughout the summer, now\ndangled around me in abundant clusters of the deepest purple,\ndeliciously sweet to the taste, and, though wild, yet free from that\nungentle flavor which distinguishes nearly all our native and\nuncultivated grapes.  Methought a wine might be pressed out of them\npossessing a passionate zest, and endowed with a new kind of\nintoxicating quality, attended with such bacchanalian ecstasies as the\ntamer grapes of Madeira, France, and the Rhine are inadequate to\nproduce.  And I longed to quaff a great goblet of it that moment!\n\nWhile devouring the grapes, I looked on all sides out of the peep-holes\nof my hermitage, and saw the farmhouse, the fields, and almost every\npart of our domain, but not a single human figure in the landscape.\nSome of the windows of the house were open, but with no more signs of\nlife than in a dead man's unshut eyes.  The barn-door was ajar, and\nswinging in the breeze.  The big old dog,--he was a relic of the former\ndynasty of the farm,--that hardly ever stirred out of the yard, was\nnowhere to be seen.  What, then, had become of all the fraternity and\nsisterhood?  Curious to ascertain this point, I let myself down out of\nthe tree, and going to the edge of the wood, was glad to perceive our\nherd of cows chewing the cud or grazing not far off.  I fancied, by\ntheir manner, that two or three of them recognized me (as, indeed, they\nought, for I had milked them and been their chamberlain times without\nnumber); but, after staring me in the face a little while, they\nphlegmatically began grazing and chewing their cuds again.  Then I grew\nfoolishly angry at so cold a reception, and flung some rotten fragments\nof an old stump at these unsentimental cows.\n\nSkirting farther round the pasture, I heard voices and much laughter\nproceeding from the interior of the wood.  Voices, male and feminine;\nlaughter, not only of fresh young throats, but the bass of grown\npeople, as if solemn organ-pipes should pour out airs of merriment. Not\na voice spoke, but I knew it better than my own; not a laugh, but its\ncadences were familiar.  The wood, in this portion of it, seemed as\nfull of jollity as if Comus and his crew were holding their revels in\none of its usually lonesome glades.  Stealing onward as far as I durst,\nwithout hazard of discovery, I saw a concourse of strange figures\nbeneath the overshadowing branches.  They appeared, and vanished, and\ncame again, confusedly with the streaks of sunlight glimmering down\nupon them.\n\nAmong them was an Indian chief, with blanket, feathers, and war-paint,\nand uplifted tomahawk; and near him, looking fit to be his woodland\nbride, the goddess Diana, with the crescent on her head, and attended\nby our big lazy dog, in lack of any fleeter hound.  Drawing an arrow\nfrom her quiver, she let it fly at a venture, and hit the very tree\nbehind which I happened to be lurking.  Another group consisted of a\nBavarian broom-girl, a negro of the Jim Crow order, one or two\nforesters of the Middle Ages, a Kentucky woodsman in his trimmed\nhunting-shirt and deerskin leggings, and a Shaker elder, quaint,\ndemure, broad-brimmed, and square-skirted.  Shepherds of Arcadia, and\nallegoric figures from the \"Faerie Queen,\" were oddly mixed up with\nthese.  Arm in arm, or otherwise huddled together in strange\ndiscrepancy, stood grim Puritans, gay Cavaliers, and Revolutionary\nofficers with three-cornered cocked hats, and queues longer than their\nswords.  A bright-complexioned, dark-haired, vivacious little gypsy,\nwith a red shawl over her head, went from one group to another, telling\nfortunes by palmistry; and Moll Pitcher, the renowned old witch of\nLynn, broomstick in hand, showed herself prominently in the midst, as\nif announcing all these apparitions to be the offspring of her\nnecromantic art.  But Silas Foster, who leaned against a tree near by,\nin his customary blue frock and smoking a short pipe, did more to\ndisenchant the scene, with his look of shrewd, acrid, Yankee\nobservation, than twenty witches and necromancers could have done in\nthe way of rendering it weird and fantastic.\n\nA little farther off, some old-fashioned skinkers and drawers, all with\nportentously red noses, were spreading a banquet on the leaf-strewn\nearth; while a horned and long-tailed gentleman (in whom I recognized\nthe fiendish musician erst seen by Tam O'Shanter) tuned his fiddle, and\nsummoned the whole motley rout to a dance, before partaking of the\nfestal cheer.  So they joined hands in a circle, whirling round so\nswiftly, so madly, and so merrily, in time and tune with the Satanic\nmusic, that their separate incongruities were blended all together, and\nthey became a kind of entanglement that went nigh to turn one's brain\nwith merely looking at it.  Anon they stopt all of a sudden, and\nstaring at one another's figures, set up a roar of laughter; whereat a\nshower of the September leaves (which, all day long, had been\nhesitating whether to fall or no) were shaken off by the movement of\nthe air, and came eddying down upon the revellers.\n\nThen, for lack of breath, ensued a silence, at the deepest point of\nwhich, tickled by the oddity of surprising my grave associates in this\nmasquerading trim, I could not possibly refrain from a burst of\nlaughter on my own separate account.\n\n\"Hush!\"  I heard the pretty gypsy fortuneteller say.  \"Who is that\nlaughing?\"\n\n\"Some profane intruder!\" said the goddess Diana.  \"I shall send an\narrow through his heart, or change him into a stag, as I did Actaeon,\nif he peeps from behind the trees!\"\n\n\"Me take his scalp!\" cried the Indian chief, brandishing his tomahawk,\nand cutting a great caper in the air.\n\n\"I'll root him in the earth with a spell that I have at my tongue's\nend!\" squeaked Moll Pitcher.  \"And the green moss shall grow all over\nhim, before he gets free again!\"\n\n\"The voice was Miles Coverdale's,\" said the fiendish fiddler, with a\nwhisk of his tail and a toss of his horns.  \"My music has brought him\nhither.  He is always ready to dance to the Devil's tune!\"\n\nThus put on the right track, they all recognized the voice at once, and\nset up a simultaneous shout.\n\n\"Miles!  Miles!  Miles Coverdale, where are you?\" they cried. \"Zenobia!\nQueen Zenobia! here is one of your vassals lurking in the wood.\nCommand him to approach and pay his duty!\"\n\nThe whole fantastic rabble forthwith streamed off in pursuit of me, so\nthat I was like a mad poet hunted by chimeras.  Having fairly the start\nof them, however, I succeeded in making my escape, and soon left their\nmerriment and riot at a good distance in the rear.  Its fainter tones\nassumed a kind of mournfulness, and were finally lost in the hush and\nsolemnity of the wood.  In my haste, I stumbled over a heap of logs and\nsticks that had been cut for firewood, a great while ago, by some\nformer possessor of the soil, and piled up square, in order to be\ncarted or sledded away to the farmhouse.  But, being forgotten, they\nhad lain there perhaps fifty years, and possibly much longer; until, by\nthe accumulation of moss, and the leaves falling over them, and\ndecaying there, from autumn to autumn, a green mound was formed, in\nwhich the softened outline of the woodpile was still perceptible.  In\nthe fitful mood that then swayed my mind, I found something strangely\naffecting in this simple circumstance.  I imagined the long-dead\nwoodman, and his long-dead wife and children, coming out of their chill\ngraves, and essaying to make a fire with this heap of mossy fuel!\n\nFrom this spot I strayed onward, quite lost in reverie, and neither\nknew nor cared whither I was going, until a low, soft, well-remembered\nvoice spoke, at a little distance.\n\n\"There is Mr. Coverdale!\"\n\n\"Miles Coverdale!\" said another voice,--and its tones were very stern.\n\"Let him come forward, then!\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Coverdale,\" cried a woman's voice,--clear and melodious, but,\njust then, with something unnatural in its chord,--\"you are welcome!\nBut you come half an hour too late, and have missed a scene which you\nwould have enjoyed!\"\n\nI looked up and found myself nigh Eliot's pulpit, at the base of which\nsat Hollingsworth, with Priscilla at his feet and Zenobia standing\nbefore them.\n\n\n\nXXV. THE THREE TOGETHER\n\nHollingsworth was in his ordinary working-dress.  Priscilla wore a\npretty and simple gown, with a kerchief about her neck, and a calash,\nwhich she had flung back from her head, leaving it suspended by the\nstrings.  But Zenobia (whose part among the maskers, as may be\nsupposed, was no inferior one) appeared in a costume of fanciful\nmagnificence, with her jewelled flower as the central ornament of what\nresembled a leafy crown, or coronet.  She represented the Oriental\nprincess by whose name we were accustomed to know her.  Her attitude\nwas free and noble; yet, if a queen's, it was not that of a queen\ntriumphant, but dethroned, on trial for her life, or, perchance,\ncondemned already.  The spirit of the conflict seemed, nevertheless, to\nbe alive in her.  Her eyes were on fire; her cheeks had each a crimson\nspot, so exceedingly vivid, and marked with so definite an outline,\nthat I at first doubted whether it were not artificial.  In a very\nbrief space, however, this idea was shamed by the paleness that ensued,\nas the blood sunk suddenly away.  Zenobia now looked like marble.\n\nOne always feels the fact, in an instant, when he has intruded on those\nwho love, or those who hate, at some acme of their passion that puts\nthem into a sphere of their own, where no other spirit can pretend to\nstand on equal ground with them.  I was confused,--affected even with a\nspecies of terror,--and wished myself away. The intenseness of their\nfeelings gave them the exclusive property of the soil and atmosphere,\nand left me no right to be or breathe there.\n\n\"Hollingsworth,--Zenobia,--I have just returned to Blithedale,\" said I,\n\"and had no thought of finding you here.  We shall meet again at the\nhouse.  I will retire.\"\n\n\"This place is free to you,\" answered Hollingsworth.\n\n\"As free as to ourselves,\" added Zenobia.  \"This long while past, you\nhave been following up your game, groping for human emotions in the\ndark corners of the heart.  Had you been here a little sooner, you\nmight have seen them dragged into the daylight.  I could even wish to\nhave my trial over again, with you standing by to see fair play!  Do\nyou know, Mr. Coverdale, I have been on trial for my life?\"\n\nShe laughed, while speaking thus.  But, in truth, as my eyes wandered\nfrom one of the group to another, I saw in Hollingsworth all that an\nartist could desire for the grim portrait of a Puritan magistrate\nholding inquest of life and death in a case of witchcraft; in Zenobia,\nthe sorceress herself, not aged, wrinkled, and decrepit, but fair\nenough to tempt Satan with a force reciprocal to his own; and, in\nPriscilla, the pale victim, whose soul and body had been wasted by her\nspells.  Had a pile of fagots been heaped against the rock, this hint\nof impending doom would have completed the suggestive picture.\n\n\"It was too hard upon me,\" continued Zenobia, addressing Hollingsworth,\n\"that judge, jury, and accuser should all be comprehended in one man!\nI demur, as I think the lawyers say, to the jurisdiction.  But let the\nlearned Judge Coverdale seat himself on the top of the rock, and you\nand me stand at its base, side by side, pleading our cause before him!\nThere might, at least, be two criminals instead of one.\"\n\n\"You forced this on me,\" replied Hollingsworth, looking her sternly in\nthe face.  \"Did I call you hither from among the masqueraders yonder?\nDo I assume to be your judge?  No; except so far as I have an\nunquestionable right of judgment, in order to settle my own line of\nbehavior towards those with whom the events of life bring me in\ncontact.  True, I have already judged you, but not on the world's\npart,--neither do I pretend to pass a sentence!\"\n\n\"Ah, this is very good!\" cried Zenobia with a smile.  \"What strange\nbeings you men are, Mr. Coverdale!--is it not so?  It is the simplest\nthing in the world with you to bring a woman before your secret\ntribunals, and judge and condemn her unheard, and then tell her to go\nfree without a sentence.  The misfortune is, that this same secret\ntribunal chances to be the only judgment-seat that a true woman stands\nin awe of, and that any verdict short of acquittal is equivalent to a\ndeath sentence!\"\n\nThe more I looked at them, and the more I heard, the stronger grew my\nimpression that a crisis had just come and gone.  On Hollingsworth's\nbrow it had left a stamp like that of irrevocable doom, of which his\nown will was the instrument.  In Zenobia's whole person, beholding her\nmore closely, I saw a riotous agitation; the almost delirious\ndisquietude of a great struggle, at the close of which the vanquished\none felt her strength and courage still mighty within her, and longed\nto renew the contest.  My sensations were as if I had come upon a\nbattlefield before the smoke was as yet cleared away.\n\nAnd what subjects had been discussed here?  All, no doubt, that for so\nmany months past had kept my heart and my imagination idly feverish.\nZenobia's whole character and history; the true nature of her\nmysterious connection with Westervelt; her later purposes towards\nHollingsworth, and, reciprocally, his in reference to her; and,\nfinally, the degree in which Zenobia had been cognizant of the plot\nagainst Priscilla, and what, at last, had been the real object of that\nscheme.  On these points, as before, I was left to my own conjectures.\nOne thing, only, was certain.  Zenobia and Hollingsworth were friends\nno longer.  If their heartstrings were ever intertwined, the knot had\nbeen adjudged an entanglement, and was now violently broken.\n\nBut Zenobia seemed unable to rest content with the matter in the\nposture which it had assumed.\n\n\"Ah! do we part so?\" exclaimed she, seeing Hollingsworth about to\nretire.\n\n\"And why not?\" said he, with almost rude abruptness.  \"What is there\nfurther to be said between us?\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps nothing,\" answered Zenobia, looking him in the face, and\nsmiling.  \"But we have come many times before to this gray rock, and we\nhave talked very softly among the whisperings of the birch-trees.  They\nwere pleasant hours!  I love to make the latest of them, though not\naltogether so delightful, loiter away as slowly as may be.  And,\nbesides, you have put many queries to me at this, which you design to\nbe our last interview; and being driven, as I must acknowledge, into a\ncorner, I have responded with reasonable frankness.  But now, with your\nfree consent, I desire the privilege of asking a few questions, in my\nturn.\"\n\n\"I have no concealments,\" said Hollingsworth.\n\n\"We shall see,\" answered Zenobia.  \"I would first inquire whether you\nhave supposed me to be wealthy?\"\n\n\"On that point,\" observed Hollingsworth, \"I have had the opinion which\nthe world holds.\"\n\n\"And I held it likewise,\" said Zenobia.  \"Had I not, Heaven is my\nwitness the knowledge should have been as free to you as me.  It is\nonly three days since I knew the strange fact that threatens to make me\npoor; and your own acquaintance with it, I suspect, is of at least as\nold a date.  I fancied myself affluent.  You are aware, too, of the\ndisposition which I purposed making of the larger portion of my\nimaginary opulence,--nay, were it all, I had not hesitated.  Let me ask\nyou, further, did I ever propose or intimate any terms of compact, on\nwhich depended this--as the world would consider it--so important\nsacrifice?\"\n\n\"You certainly spoke of none,\" said Hollingsworth.\n\n\"Nor meant any,\" she responded.  \"I was willing to realize your dream\nfreely,--generously, as some might think,--but, at all events, fully,\nand heedless though it should prove the ruin of my fortune. If, in your\nown thoughts, you have imposed any conditions of this expenditure, it\nis you that must be held responsible for whatever is sordid and\nunworthy in them.  And now one other question.  Do you love this girl?\"\n\n\"O Zenobia!\" exclaimed Priscilla, shrinking back, as if longing for the\nrock to topple over and hide her.\n\n\"Do you love her?\" repeated Zenobia.\n\n\"Had you asked me that question a short time since,\" replied\nHollingsworth, after a pause, during which, it seemed to me, even the\nbirch-trees held their whispering breath, \"I should have told\nyou--'No!' My feelings for Priscilla differed little from those of an\nelder brother, watching tenderly over the gentle sister whom God has\ngiven him to protect.\"\n\n\"And what is your answer now?\" persisted Zenobia.\n\n\"I do love her!\" said Hollingsworth, uttering the words with a deep\ninward breath, instead of speaking them outright.  \"As well declare it\nthus as in any other way.  I do love her!\"\n\n\"Now, God be judge between us,\" cried Zenobia, breaking into sudden\npassion, \"which of us two has most mortally offended Him!  At least, I\nam a woman, with every fault, it may be, that a woman ever had,--weak,\nvain, unprincipled (like most of my sex; for our virtues, when we have\nany, are merely impulsive and intuitive), passionate, too, and pursuing\nmy foolish and unattainable ends by indirect and cunning, though\nabsurdly chosen means, as an hereditary bond-slave must; false,\nmoreover, to the whole circle of good, in my reckless truth to the\nlittle good I saw before me,--but still a woman!  A creature whom only\na little change of earthly fortune, a little kinder smile of Him who\nsent me hither, and one true heart to encourage and direct me, might\nhave made all that a woman can be! But how is it with you?  Are you a\nman?  No; but a monster!  A cold, heartless, self-beginning and\nself-ending piece of mechanism!\"\n\n\"With what, then, do you charge me!\" asked Hollingsworth, aghast, and\ngreatly disturbed by this attack.  \"Show me one selfish end, in all I\never aimed at, and you may cut it out of my bosom with a knife!\"\n\n\"It is all self!\" answered Zenobia with still intenser bitterness.\n\"Nothing else; nothing but self, self, self!  The fiend, I doubt not,\nhas made his choicest mirth of you these seven years past, and\nespecially in the mad summer which we have spent together.  I see it\nnow!  I am awake, disenchanted, disinthralled!  Self, self, self! You\nhave embodied yourself in a project.  You are a better masquerader than\nthe witches and gypsies yonder; for your disguise is a self-deception.\nSee whither it has brought you!  First, you aimed a death-blow, and a\ntreacherous one, at this scheme of a purer and higher life, which so\nmany noble spirits had wrought out.  Then, because Coverdale could not\nbe quite your slave, you threw him ruthlessly away.  And you took me,\ntoo, into your plan, as long as there was hope of my being available,\nand now fling me aside again, a broken tool!  But, foremost and\nblackest of your sins, you stifled down your inmost consciousness!--you\ndid a deadly wrong to your own heart!--you were ready to sacrifice this\ngirl, whom, if God ever visibly showed a purpose, He put into your\ncharge, and through whom He was striving to redeem you!\"\n\n\"This is a woman's view,\" said Hollingsworth, growing deadly pale,--\"a\nwoman's, whose whole sphere of action is in the heart, and who can\nconceive of no higher nor wider one!\"\n\n\"Be silent!\" cried Zenobia imperiously.  \"You know neither man nor\nwoman!  The utmost that can be said in your behalf--and because I would\nnot be wholly despicable in my own eyes, but would fain excuse my\nwasted feelings, nor own it wholly a delusion, therefore I say it--is,\nthat a great and rich heart has been ruined in your breast. Leave me,\nnow.  You have done with me, and I with you.  Farewell!\"\n\n\"Priscilla,\" said Hollingsworth, \"come.\"  Zenobia smiled; possibly I\ndid so too.  Not often, in human life, has a gnawing sense of injury\nfound a sweeter morsel of revenge than was conveyed in the tone with\nwhich Hollingsworth spoke those two words.  It was the abased and\ntremulous tone of a man whose faith in himself was shaken, and who\nsought, at last, to lean on an affection.  Yes; the strong man bowed\nhimself and rested on this poor Priscilla!  Oh, could she have failed\nhim, what a triumph for the lookers-on!\n\nAnd, at first, I half imagined that she was about to fail him.  She\nrose up, stood shivering like the birch leaves that trembled over her\nhead, and then slowly tottered, rather than walked, towards Zenobia.\nArriving at her feet, she sank down there, in the very same attitude\nwhich she had assumed on their first meeting, in the kitchen of the old\nfarmhouse.  Zenobia remembered it.\n\n\"Ah, Priscilla!\" said she, shaking her head, \"how much is changed since\nthen!  You kneel to a dethroned princess.  You, the victorious one!\nBut he is waiting for you.  Say what you wish, and leave me.\"\n\n\"We are sisters!\" gasped Priscilla.\n\nI fancied that I understood the word and action.  It meant the offering\nof herself, and all she had, to be at Zenobia's disposal. But the\nlatter would not take it thus.\n\n\"True, we are sisters!\" she replied; and, moved by the sweet word, she\nstooped down and kissed Priscilla; but not lovingly, for a sense of\nfatal harm received through her seemed to be lurking in Zenobia's\nheart.  \"We had one father!  You knew it from the first; I, but a\nlittle while,--else some things that have chanced might have been\nspared you.  But I never wished you harm.  You stood between me and an\nend which I desired.  I wanted a clear path.  No matter what I meant.\nIt is over now.  Do you forgive me?\"\n\n\"O Zenobia,\" sobbed Priscilla, \"it is I that feel like the guilty one!\"\n\n\"No, no, poor little thing!\" said Zenobia, with a sort of contempt.\n\"You have been my evil fate, but there never was a babe with less\nstrength or will to do an injury.  Poor child!  Methinks you have but a\nmelancholy lot before you, sitting all alone in that wide, cheerless\nheart, where, for aught you know,--and as I, alas! believe,--the fire\nwhich you have kindled may soon go out.  Ah, the thought makes me\nshiver for you!  What will you do, Priscilla, when you find no spark\namong the ashes?\"\n\n\"Die!\" she answered.\n\n\"That was well said!\" responded Zenobia, with an approving smile.\n\"There is all a woman in your little compass, my poor sister.\nMeanwhile, go with him, and live!\"\n\nShe waved her away with a queenly gesture, and turned her own face to\nthe rock.  I watched Priscilla, wondering what judgment she would pass\nbetween Zenobia and Hollingsworth; how interpret his behavior, so as to\nreconcile it with true faith both towards her sister and herself; how\ncompel her love for him to keep any terms whatever with her sisterly\naffection!  But, in truth, there was no such difficulty as I imagined.\nHer engrossing love made it all clear.  Hollingsworth could have no\nfault.  That was the one principle at the centre of the universe.  And\nthe doubtful guilt or possible integrity of other people, appearances,\nself-evident facts, the testimony of her own senses,--even\nHollingsworth's self-accusation, had he volunteered it,--would have\nweighed not the value of a mote of thistledown on the other side.  So\nsecure was she of his right, that she never thought of comparing it\nwith another's wrong, but left the latter to itself.\n\nHollingsworth drew her arm within his, and soon disappeared with her\namong the trees.  I cannot imagine how Zenobia knew when they were out\nof sight; she never glanced again towards them.  But, retaining a proud\nattitude so long as they might have thrown back a retiring look, they\nwere no sooner departed,--utterly departed,--than she began slowly to\nsink down.  It was as if a great, invisible, irresistible weight were\npressing her to the earth.  Settling upon her knees, she leaned her\nforehead against the rock, and sobbed convulsively; dry sobs they\nseemed to be, such as have nothing to do with tears.\n\n\n\nXXVI. ZENOBIA AND COVERDALE\n\nZenobia had entirely forgotten me.  She fancied herself alone with her\ngreat grief.  And had it been only a common pity that I felt for\nher,--the pity that her proud nature would have repelled, as the one\nworst wrong which the world yet held in reserve,--the sacredness and\nawfulness of the crisis might have impelled me to steal away silently,\nso that not a dry leaf should rustle under my feet.  I would have left\nher to struggle, in that solitude, with only the eye of God upon her.\nBut, so it happened, I never once dreamed of questioning my right to be\nthere now, as I had questioned it just before, when I came so suddenly\nupon Hollingsworth and herself, in the passion of their recent debate.\nIt suits me not to explain what was the analogy that I saw or imagined\nbetween Zenobia's situation and mine; nor, I believe, will the reader\ndetect this one secret, hidden beneath many a revelation which perhaps\nconcerned me less.  In simple truth, however, as Zenobia leaned her\nforehead against the rock, shaken with that tearless agony, it seemed\nto me that the self-same pang, with hardly mitigated torment, leaped\nthrilling from her heartstrings to my own.  Was it wrong, therefore, if\nI felt myself consecrated to the priesthood by sympathy like this, and\ncalled upon to minister to this woman's affliction, so far as mortal\ncould?\n\nBut, indeed, what could mortal do for her?  Nothing!  The attempt would\nbe a mockery and an anguish.  Time, it is true, would steal away her\ngrief, and bury it and the best of her heart in the same grave.  But\nDestiny itself, methought, in its kindliest mood, could do no better\nfor Zenobia, in the way of quick relief; than to cause the impending\nrock to impend a little farther, and fall upon her head. So I leaned\nagainst a tree, and listened to her sobs, in unbroken silence.  She was\nhalf prostrate, half kneeling, with her forehead still pressed against\nthe rock.  Her sobs were the only sound; she did not groan, nor give\nany other utterance to her distress.  It was all involuntary.\n\nAt length she sat up, put back her hair, and stared about her with a\nbewildered aspect, as if not distinctly recollecting the scene through\nwhich she had passed, nor cognizant of the situation in which it left\nher.  Her face and brow were almost purple with the rush of blood.\nThey whitened, however, by and by, and for some time retained this\ndeathlike hue.  She put her hand to her forehead, with a gesture that\nmade me forcibly conscious of an intense and living pain there.\n\nHer glance, wandering wildly to and fro, passed over me several times,\nwithout appearing to inform her of my presence.  But, finally, a look\nof recognition gleamed from her eyes into mine.\n\n\"Is it you, Miles Coverdale?\" said she, smiling.  \"Ah, I perceive what\nyou are about!  You are turning this whole affair into a ballad. Pray\nlet me hear as many stanzas as you happen to have ready.\"\n\n\"Oh, hush, Zenobia!\"  I answered.  \"Heaven knows what an ache is in my\nsoul!\"\n\n\"It is genuine tragedy, is it not?\" rejoined Zenobia, with a sharp,\nlight laugh.  \"And you are willing to allow, perhaps, that I have had\nhard measure.  But it is a woman's doom, and I have deserved it like a\nwoman; so let there be no pity, as, on my part, there shall be no\ncomplaint.  It is all right, now, or will shortly be so.  But, Mr.\nCoverdale, by all means write this ballad, and put your soul's ache\ninto it, and turn your sympathy to good account, as other poets do, and\nas poets must, unless they choose to give us glittering icicles instead\nof lines of fire.  As for the moral, it shall be distilled into the\nfinal stanza, in a drop of bitter honey.\"\n\n\"What shall it be, Zenobia?\"  I inquired, endeavoring to fall in with\nher mood.\n\n\"Oh, a very old one will serve the purpose,\" she replied.  \"There are\nno new truths, much as we have prided ourselves on finding some.  A\nmoral?  Why, this: That, in the battlefield of life, the downright\nstroke, that would fall only on a man's steel headpiece, is sure to\nlight on a woman's heart, over which she wears no breastplate, and\nwhose wisdom it is, therefore, to keep out of the conflict.  Or, this:\nThat the whole universe, her own sex and yours, and Providence, or\nDestiny, to boot, make common cause against the woman who swerves one\nhair's-breadth out of the beaten track.  Yes; and add (for I may as\nwell own it, now) that, with that one hair's-breadth, she goes all\nastray, and never sees the world in its true aspect afterwards.\"\n\n\"This last is too stern a moral,\" I observed.  \"Cannot we soften it a\nlittle?\"\n\n\"Do it if you like, at your own peril, not on my responsibility,\" she\nanswered.  Then, with a sudden change of subject, she went on: \"After\nall, he has flung away what would have served him better than the poor,\npale flower he kept.  What can Priscilla do for him?  Put passionate\nwarmth into his heart, when it shall be chilled with frozen hopes?\nStrengthen his hands, when they are weary with much doing and no\nperformance?  No! but only tend towards him with a blind, instinctive\nlove, and hang her little, puny weakness for a clog upon his arm!  She\ncannot even give him such sympathy as is worth the name.  For will he\nnever, in many an hour of darkness, need that proud intellectual\nsympathy which he might have had from me?--the sympathy that would\nflash light along his course, and guide, as well as cheer him?  Poor\nHollingsworth! Where will he find it now?\"\n\n\"Hollingsworth has a heart of ice!\" said I bitterly.  \"He is a wretch!\"\n\n\"Do him no wrong,\" interrupted Zenobia, turning haughtily upon me.\n\"Presume not to estimate a man like Hollingsworth.  It was my fault,\nall along, and none of his.  I see it now!  He never sought me.  Why\nshould he seek me?  What had I to offer him?  A miserable, bruised, and\nbattered heart, spoilt long before he met me.  A life, too, hopelessly\nentangled with a villain's!  He did well to cast me off. God be\npraised, he did it!  And yet, had he trusted me, and borne with me a\nlittle longer, I would have saved him all this trouble.\"\n\nShe was silent for a time, and stood with her eyes fixed on the ground.\nAgain raising them, her look was more mild and calm.\n\n\"Miles Coverdale!\" said she.\n\n\"Well, Zenobia,\" I responded.  \"Can I do you any service?\"\n\n\"Very little,\" she replied.  \"But it is my purpose, as you may well\nimagine, to remove from Blithedale; and, most likely, I may not see\nHollingsworth again.  A woman in my position, you understand, feels\nscarcely at her ease among former friends.  New faces,--unaccustomed\nlooks,--those only can she tolerate.  She would pine among familiar\nscenes; she would be apt to blush, too, under the eyes that knew her\nsecret; her heart might throb uncomfortably; she would mortify herself,\nI suppose, with foolish notions of having sacrificed the honor of her\nsex at the foot of proud, contumacious man.  Poor womanhood, with its\nrights and wrongs!  Here will be new matter for my course of lectures,\nat the idea of which you smiled, Mr. Coverdale, a month or two ago.\nBut, as you have really a heart and sympathies, as far as they go, and\nas I shall depart without seeing Hollingsworth, I must entreat you to\nbe a messenger between him and me.\"\n\n\"Willingly,\" said I, wondering at the strange way in which her mind\nseemed to vibrate from the deepest earnest to mere levity.  \"What is\nthe message?\"\n\n\"True,--what is it?\" exclaimed Zenobia.  \"After all, I hardly know. On\nbetter consideration, I have no message.  Tell him,--tell him something\npretty and pathetic, that will come nicely and sweetly into your\nballad,--anything you please, so it be tender and submissive enough.\nTell him he has murdered me!  Tell him that I'll haunt him! \"--She\nspoke these words with the wildest energy.--\"And give him--no, give\nPriscilla--this!\"\n\nThus saying, she took the jewelled flower out of her hair; and it\nstruck me as the act of a queen, when worsted in a combat, discrowning\nherself, as if she found a sort of relief in abasing all her pride.\n\n\"Bid her wear this for Zenobia's sake,\" she continued.  \"She is a\npretty little creature, and will make as soft and gentle a wife as the\nveriest Bluebeard could desire.  Pity that she must fade so soon! These\ndelicate and puny maidens always do.  Ten years hence, let\nHollingsworth look at my face and Priscilla's, and then choose betwixt\nthem.  Or, if he pleases, let him do it now.\"\n\nHow magnificently Zenobia looked as she said this!  The effect of her\nbeauty was even heightened by the over-consciousness and\nself-recognition of it, into which, I suppose, Hollingsworth's scorn\nhad driven her.  She understood the look of admiration in my face;\nand--Zenobia to the last--it gave her pleasure.\n\n\"It is an endless pity,\" said she, \"that I had not bethought myself of\nwinning your heart, Mr. Coverdale, instead of Hollingsworth's.  I think\nI should have succeeded, and many women would have deemed you the\nworthier conquest of the two.  You are certainly much the handsomest\nman.  But there is a fate in these things.  And beauty, in a man, has\nbeen of little account with me since my earliest girlhood, when, for\nonce, it turned my head.  Now, farewell!\"\n\n\"Zenobia, whither are you going?\"  I asked.\n\n\"No matter where,\" said she.  \"But I am weary of this place, and sick\nto death of playing at philanthropy and progress.  Of all varieties of\nmock-life, we have surely blundered into the very emptiest mockery in\nour effort to establish the one true system.  I have done with it; and\nBlithedale must find another woman to superintend the laundry, and you,\nMr. Coverdale, another nurse to make your gruel, the next time you fall\nill.  It was, indeed, a foolish dream!  Yet it gave us some pleasant\nsummer days, and bright hopes, while they lasted.  It can do no more;\nnor will it avail us to shed tears over a broken bubble.  Here is my\nhand!  Adieu!\"\n\nShe gave me her hand with the same free, whole-souled gesture as on the\nfirst afternoon of our acquaintance, and, being greatly moved, I\nbethought me of no better method of expressing my deep sympathy than to\ncarry it to my lips.  In so doing, I perceived that this white hand--so\nhospitably warm when I first touched it, five months since--was now\ncold as a veritable piece of snow.\n\n\"How very cold!\"  I exclaimed, holding it between both my own, with the\nvain idea of warming it.  \"What can be the reason?  It is really\ndeathlike!\"\n\n\"The extremities die first, they say,\" answered Zenobia, laughing. \"And\nso you kiss this poor, despised, rejected hand!  Well, my dear friend,\nI thank you.  You have reserved your homage for the fallen. Lip of man\nwill never touch my hand again.  I intend to become a Catholic, for the\nsake of going into a nunnery.  When you next hear of Zenobia, her face\nwill be behind the black veil; so look your last at it now,--for all is\nover.  Once more, farewell!\"\n\nShe withdrew her hand, yet left a lingering pressure, which I felt long\nafterwards.  So intimately connected as I had been with perhaps the\nonly man in whom she was ever truly interested, Zenobia looked on me as\nthe representative of all the past, and was conscious that, in bidding\nme adieu, she likewise took final leave of Hollingsworth, and of this\nwhole epoch of her life.  Never did her beauty shine out more\nlustrously than in the last glimpse that I had of her.  She departed,\nand was soon hidden among the trees.  But, whether it was the strong\nimpression of the foregoing scene, or whatever else the cause, I was\naffected with a fantasy that Zenobia had not actually gone, but was\nstill hovering about the spot and haunting it.  I seemed to feel her\neyes upon me.  It was as if the vivid coloring of her character had\nleft a brilliant stain upon the air.  By degrees, however, the\nimpression grew less distinct.  I flung myself upon the fallen leaves\nat the base of Eliot's pulpit.  The sunshine withdrew up the tree\ntrunks and flickered on the topmost boughs; gray twilight made the wood\nobscure; the stars brightened out; the pendent boughs became wet with\nchill autumnal dews.  But I was listless, worn out with emotion on my\nown behalf and sympathy for others, and had no heart to leave my\ncomfortless lair beneath the rock.\n\nI must have fallen asleep, and had a dream, all the circumstances of\nwhich utterly vanished at the moment when they converged to some\ntragical catastrophe, and thus grew too powerful for the thin sphere of\nslumber that enveloped them.  Starting from the ground, I found the\nrisen moon shining upon the rugged face of the rock, and myself all in\na tremble.\n\n\n\nXXVII. MIDNIGHT\n\nIt could not have been far from midnight when I came beneath\nHollingsworth's window, and, finding it open, flung in a tuft of grass\nwith earth at the roots, and heard it fall upon the floor.  He was\neither awake or sleeping very lightly; for scarcely a moment had gone\nby before he looked out and discerned me standing in the moonlight.\n\n\"Is it you, Coverdale?\" he asked.  \"What is the matter?\"\n\n\"Come down to me, Hollingsworth!\"  I answered.  \"I am anxious to speak\nwith you.\"\n\nThe strange tone of my own voice startled me, and him, probably, no\nless.  He lost no time, and soon issued from the house-door, with his\ndress half arranged.\n\n\"Again, what is the matter?\" he asked impatiently.\n\n\"Have you seen Zenobia,\" said I, \"since you parted from her at Eliot's\npulpit?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Hollingsworth; \"nor did I expect it.\"\n\nHis voice was deep, but had a tremor in it,\n\nHardly had he spoken, when Silas Foster thrust his head, done up in a\ncotton handkerchief, out of another window, and took what he called as\nit literally was--a squint at us.\n\n\"Well, folks, what are ye about here?\" he demanded.  \"Aha! are you\nthere, Miles Coverdale?  You have been turning night into day since you\nleft us, I reckon; and so you find it quite natural to come prowling\nabout the house at this time o' night, frightening my old woman out of\nher wits, and making her disturb a tired man out of his best nap.  In\nwith you, you vagabond, and to bed!\"\n\n\"Dress yourself quickly, Foster,\" said I. \"We want your assistance.\"\n\nI could not, for the life of me, keep that strange tone out of my\nvoice.  Silas Foster, obtuse as were his sensibilities, seemed to feel\nthe ghastly earnestness that was conveyed in it as well as\nHollingsworth did.  He immediately withdrew his head, and I heard him\nyawning, muttering to his wife, and again yawning heavily, while he\nhurried on his clothes.  Meanwhile I showed Hollingsworth a delicate\nhandkerchief, marked with a well-known cipher, and told where I had\nfound it, and other circumstances, which had filled me with a suspicion\nso terrible that I left him, if he dared, to shape it out for himself.\nBy the time my brief explanation was finished, we were joined by Silas\nFoster in his blue woollen frock.\n\n\"Well, boys,\" cried he peevishly, \"what is to pay now?\"\n\n\"Tell him, Hollingsworth,\" said I.\n\nHollingsworth shivered perceptibly, and drew in a hard breath betwixt\nhis teeth.  He steadied himself, however, and, looking the matter more\nfirmly in the face than I had done, explained to Foster my suspicions,\nand the grounds of them, with a distinctness from which, in spite of my\nutmost efforts, my words had swerved aside.  The tough-nerved yeoman,\nin his comment, put a finish on the business, and brought out the\nhideous idea in its full terror, as if he were removing the napkin from\nthe face of a corpse.\n\n\"And so you think she's drowned herself?\" he cried.  I turned away my\nface.\n\n\"What on earth should the young woman do that for?\" exclaimed Silas,\nhis eyes half out of his head with mere surprise.  \"Why, she has more\nmeans than she can use or waste, and lacks nothing to make her\ncomfortable, but a husband, and that's an article she could have, any\nday.  There's some mistake about this, I tell you!\"\n\n\"Come,\" said I, shuddering; \"let us go and ascertain the truth.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" answered Silas Foster; \"just as you say.  We'll take the\nlong pole, with the hook at the end, that serves to get the bucket out\nof the draw-well when the rope is broken.  With that, and a couple of\nlong-handled hay-rakes, I'll answer for finding her, if she's anywhere\nto be found.  Strange enough!  Zenobia drown herself! No, no; I don't\nbelieve it.  She had too much sense, and too much means, and enjoyed\nlife a great deal too well.\"\n\nWhen our few preparations were completed, we hastened, by a shorter\nthan the customary route, through fields and pastures, and across a\nportion of the meadow, to the particular spot on the river-bank which I\nhad paused to contemplate in the course of my afternoon's ramble. A\nnameless presentiment had again drawn me thither, after leaving Eliot's\npulpit.  I showed my companions where I had found the handkerchief, and\npointed to two or three footsteps, impressed into the clayey margin,\nand tending towards the water.  Beneath its shallow verge, among the\nwater-weeds, there were further traces, as yet unobliterated by the\nsluggish current, which was there almost at a standstill.  Silas Foster\nthrust his face down close to these footsteps, and picked up a shoe\nthat had escaped my observation, being half imbedded in the mud.\n\n\"There's a kid shoe that never was made on a Yankee last,\" observed he.\n\"I know enough of shoemaker's craft to tell that.  French manufacture;\nand see what a high instep! and how evenly she trod in it!  There never\nwas a woman that stept handsomer in her shoes than Zenobia did.  Here,\"\nhe added, addressing Hollingsworth, \"would you like to keep the shoe?\"\n\nHollingsworth started back.\n\n\"Give it to me, Foster,\" said I.\n\nI dabbled it in the water, to rinse off the mud, and have kept it ever\nsince.  Not far from this spot lay an old, leaky punt, drawn up on the\noozy river-side, and generally half full of water.  It served the\nangler to go in quest of pickerel, or the sportsman to pick up his wild\nducks.  Setting this crazy bark afloat, I seated myself in the stern\nwith the paddle, while Hollingsworth sat in the bows with the hooked\npole, and Silas Foster amidships with a hay-rake.\n\n\"It puts me in mind of my young days,\" remarked Silas, \"when I used to\nsteal out of bed to go bobbing for hornpouts and eels.\nHeigh-ho!--well, life and death together make sad work for us all!\nThen I was a boy, bobbing for fish; and now I am getting to be an old\nfellow, and here I be, groping for a dead body!  I tell you what, lads;\nif I thought anything had really happened to Zenobia, I should feel\nkind o' sorrowful.\"\n\n\"I wish, at least, you would hold your tongue,\" muttered I.\n\nThe moon, that night, though past the full, was still large and oval,\nand having risen between eight and nine o'clock, now shone aslantwise\nover the river, throwing the high, opposite bank, with its woods, into\ndeep shadow, but lighting up the hither shore pretty effectually. Not a\nray appeared to fall on the river itself.  It lapsed imperceptibly\naway, a broad, black, inscrutable depth, keeping its own secrets from\nthe eye of man, as impenetrably as mid-ocean could.\n\n\"Well, Miles Coverdale,\" said Foster, \"you are the helmsman.  How do\nyou mean to manage this business?\"\n\n\"I shall let the boat drift, broadside foremost, past that stump,\" I\nreplied.  \"I know the bottom, having sounded it in fishing.  The shore,\non this side, after the first step or two, goes off very abruptly; and\nthere is a pool, just by the stump, twelve or fifteen feet deep.  The\ncurrent could not have force enough to sweep any sunken object, even if\npartially buoyant, out of that hollow.\"\n\n\"Come, then,\" said Silas; \"but I doubt whether I can touch bottom with\nthis hay-rake, if it's as deep as you say.  Mr. Hollingsworth, I think\nyou'll be the lucky man to-night, such luck as it is.\"\n\nWe floated past the stump.  Silas Foster plied his rake manfully,\npoking it as far as he could into the water, and immersing the whole\nlength of his arm besides.  Hollingsworth at first sat motionless, with\nthe hooked pole elevated in the air.  But, by and by, with a nervous\nand jerky movement, he began to plunge it into the blackness that\nupbore us, setting his teeth, and making precisely such thrusts,\nmethought, as if he were stabbing at a deadly enemy.  I bent over the\nside of the boat.  So obscure, however, so awfully mysterious, was that\ndark stream, that--and the thought made me shiver like a leaf--I might\nas well have tried to look into the enigma of the eternal world, to\ndiscover what had become of Zenobia's soul, as into the river's depths,\nto find her body.  And there, perhaps, she lay, with her face upward,\nwhile the shadow of the boat, and my own pale face peering downward,\npassed slowly betwixt her and the sky!\n\nOnce, twice, thrice, I paddled the boat upstream, and again suffered it\nto glide, with the river's slow, funereal motion, downward.  Silas\nFoster had raked up a large mass of stuff, which, as it came towards\nthe surface, looked somewhat like a flowing garment, but proved to be a\nmonstrous tuft of water-weeds.  Hollingsworth, with a gigantic effort,\nupheaved a sunken log.  When once free of the bottom, it rose partly\nout of water,--all weedy and slimy, a devilish-looking object, which\nthe moon had not shone upon for half a hundred years,--then plunged\nagain, and sullenly returned to its old resting-place, for the remnant\nof the century.\n\n\"That looked ugly!\" quoth Silas.  \"I half thought it was the Evil One,\non the same errand as ourselves,--searching for Zenobia.\"\n\n\"He shall never get her,\" said I, giving the boat a strong impulse.\n\n\"That's not for you to say, my boy,\" retorted the yeoman.  \"Pray God he\nnever has, and never may.  Slow work this, however!  I should really be\nglad to find something!  Pshaw!  What a notion that is, when the only\ngood luck would be to paddle, and drift, and poke, and grope,\nhereabouts, till morning, and have our labor for our pains! For my\npart, I shouldn't wonder if the creature had only lost her shoe in the\nmud, and saved her soul alive, after all.  My stars! how she will laugh\nat us, to-morrow morning!\"\n\nIt is indescribable what an image of Zenobia--at the breakfast-table,\nfull of warm and mirthful life--this surmise of Silas Foster's brought\nbefore my mind.  The terrible phantasm of her death was thrown by it\ninto the remotest and dimmest background, where it seemed to grow as\nimprobable as a myth.\n\n\"Yes, Silas, it may be as you say,\" cried I. The drift of the stream\nhad again borne us a little below the stump, when I felt--yes, felt,\nfor it was as if the iron hook had smote my breast--felt\nHollingsworth's pole strike some object at the bottom of the river!\n\nHe started up, and almost overset the boat.\n\n\"Hold on!\" cried Foster; \"you have her!\"\n\nPutting a fury of strength into the effort, Hollingsworth heaved amain,\nand up came a white swash to the surface of the river.  It was the flow\nof a woman's garments.  A little higher, and we saw her dark hair\nstreaming down the current.  Black River of Death, thou hadst yielded\nup thy victim!  Zenobia was found!\n\nSilas Foster laid hold of the body; Hollingsworth likewise grappled\nwith it; and I steered towards the bank, gazing all the while at\nZenobia, whose limbs were swaying in the current close at the boat's\nside.  Arriving near the shore, we all three stept into the water, bore\nher out, and laid her on the ground beneath a tree.\n\n\"Poor child!\" said Foster,--and his dry old heart, I verily believe,\nvouchsafed a tear, \"I'm sorry for her!\"\n\nWere I to describe the perfect horror of the spectacle, the reader\nmight justly reckon it to me for a sin and shame.  For more than twelve\nlong years I have borne it in my memory, and could now reproduce it as\nfreshly as if it were still before my eyes.  Of all modes of death,\nmethinks it is the ugliest.  Her wet garments swathed limbs of terrible\ninflexibility.  She was the marble image of a death-agony.  Her arms\nhad grown rigid in the act of struggling, and were bent before her with\nclenched hands; her knees, too, were bent, and--thank God for it!--in\nthe attitude of prayer.  Ah, that rigidity! It is impossible to bear\nthe terror of it.  It seemed,--I must needs impart so much of my own\nmiserable idea,--it seemed as if her body must keep the same position\nin the coffin, and that her skeleton would keep it in the grave; and\nthat when Zenobia rose at the day of judgment, it would be in just the\nsame attitude as now!\n\nOne hope I had, and that too was mingled half with fear.  She knelt as\nif in prayer.  With the last, choking consciousness, her soul, bubbling\nout through her lips, it may be, had given itself up to the Father,\nreconciled and penitent.  But her arms!  They were bent before her, as\nif she struggled against Providence in never-ending hostility.  Her\nhands!  They were clenched in immitigable defiance. Away with the\nhideous thought.  The flitting moment after Zenobia sank into the dark\npool--when her breath was gone, and her soul at her lips was as long,\nin its capacity of God's infinite forgiveness, as the lifetime of the\nworld!\n\nFoster bent over the body, and carefully examined it.\n\n\"You have wounded the poor thing's breast,\" said he to Hollingsworth,\n\"close by her heart, too!\"\n\n\"Ha!\" cried Hollingsworth with a start.\n\nAnd so he had, indeed, both before and after death!\n\n\"See!\" said Foster.  \"That's the place where the iron struck her.  It\nlooks cruelly, but she never felt it!\"\n\nHe endeavored to arrange the arms of the corpse decently by its side.\nHis utmost strength, however, scarcely sufficed to bring them down; and\nrising again, the next instant, they bade him defiance, exactly as\nbefore.  He made another effort, with the same result.\n\n\"In God's name, Silas Foster,\" cried I with bitter indignation, \"let\nthat dead woman alone!\"\n\n\"Why, man, it's not decent!\" answered he, staring at me in amazement.\n\"I can't bear to see her looking so!  Well, well,\" added he, after a\nthird effort, \"'tis of no use, sure enough; and we must leave the women\nto do their best with her, after we get to the house.  The sooner\nthat's done, the better.\"\n\nWe took two rails from a neighboring fence, and formed a bier by laying\nacross some boards from the bottom of the boat.  And thus we bore\nZenobia homeward.  Six hours before, how beautiful!  At midnight, what\na horror!  A reflection occurs to me that will show ludicrously, I\ndoubt not, on my page, but must come in for its sterling truth. Being\nthe woman that she was, could Zenobia have foreseen all these ugly\ncircumstances of death,--how ill it would become her, the altogether\nunseemly aspect which she must put on, and especially old Silas\nFoster's efforts to improve the matter,--she would no more have\ncommitted the dreadful act than have exhibited herself to a public\nassembly in a badly fitting garment!  Zenobia, I have often thought,\nwas not quite simple in her death.  She had seen pictures, I suppose,\nof drowned persons in lithe and graceful attitudes.  And she deemed it\nwell and decorous to die as so many village maidens have, wronged in\ntheir first love, and seeking peace in the bosom of the old familiar\nstream,--so familiar that they could not dread it,--where, in\nchildhood, they used to bathe their little feet, wading mid-leg deep,\nunmindful of wet skirts.  But in Zenobia's case there was some tint of\nthe Arcadian affectation that had been visible enough in all our lives\nfor a few months past.\n\nThis, however, to my conception, takes nothing from the tragedy.  For,\nhas not the world come to an awfully sophisticated pass, when, after a\ncertain degree of acquaintance with it, we cannot even put ourselves to\ndeath in whole-hearted simplicity?  Slowly, slowly, with many a dreary\npause,--resting the bier often on some rock or balancing it across a\nmossy log, to take fresh hold,--we bore our burden onward through the\nmoonlight, and at last laid Zenobia on the floor of the old farmhouse.\nBy and by came three or four withered women and stood whispering around\nthe corpse, peering at it through their spectacles, holding up their\nskinny hands, shaking their night-capped heads, and taking counsel of\none another's experience what was to be done.\n\nWith those tire-women we left Zenobia.\n\n\n\nXXVIII. BLITHEDALE PASTURE\n\nBlithedale, thus far in its progress, had never found the necessity of\na burial-ground.  There was some consultation among us in what spot\nZenobia might most fitly be laid.  It was my own wish that she should\nsleep at the base of Eliot's pulpit, and that on the rugged front of\nthe rock the name by which we familiarly knew her, Zenobia,--and not\nanother word, should be deeply cut, and left for the moss and lichens\nto fill up at their long leisure.  But Hollingsworth (to whose ideas on\nthis point great deference was due) made it his request that her grave\nmight be dug on the gently sloping hillside, in the wide pasture,\nwhere, as we once supposed, Zenobia and he had planned to build their\ncottage.  And thus it was done, accordingly.\n\nShe was buried very much as other people have been for hundreds of\nyears gone by.  In anticipation of a death, we Blithedale colonists had\nsometimes set our fancies at work to arrange a funereal ceremony, which\nshould be the proper symbolic expression of our spiritual faith and\neternal hopes; and this we meant to substitute for those customary\nrites which were moulded originally out of the Gothic gloom, and by\nlong use, like an old velvet pall, have so much more than their first\ndeath-smell in them.  But when the occasion came we found it the\nsimplest and truest thing, after all, to content ourselves with the old\nfashion, taking away what we could, but interpolating no novelties, and\nparticularly avoiding all frippery of flowers and cheerful emblems.\nThe procession moved from the farmhouse.  Nearest the dead walked an\nold man in deep mourning, his face mostly concealed in a white\nhandkerchief, and with Priscilla leaning on his arm.  Hollingsworth and\nmyself came next.  We all stood around the narrow niche in the cold\nearth; all saw the coffin lowered in; all heard the rattle of the\ncrumbly soil upon its lid,--that final sound, which mortality awakens\non the utmost verge of sense, as if in the vain hope of bringing an\necho from the spiritual world.\n\nI noticed a stranger,--a stranger to most of those present, though\nknown to me,--who, after the coffin had descended, took up a handful of\nearth and flung it first into the grave.  I had given up\nHollingsworth's arm, and now found myself near this man.\n\n\"It was an idle thing--a foolish thing--for Zenobia to do,\" said he.\n\"She was the last woman in the world to whom death could have been\nnecessary.  It was too absurd!  I have no patience with her.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"  I inquired, smothering my horror at his cold comment, in my\neager curiosity to discover some tangible truth as to his relation with\nZenobia.  \"If any crisis could justify the sad wrong she offered to\nherself, it was surely that in which she stood.  Everything had failed\nher; prosperity in the world's sense, for her opulence was gone,--the\nheart's prosperity, in love.  And there was a secret burden on her, the\nnature of which is best known to you.  Young as she was, she had tried\nlife fully, had no more to hope, and something, perhaps, to fear.  Had\nProvidence taken her away in its own holy hand, I should have thought\nit the kindest dispensation that could be awarded to one so wrecked.\"\n\n\"You mistake the matter completely,\" rejoined Westervelt.\n\n\"What, then, is your own view of it?\"  I asked.\n\n\"Her mind was active, and various in its powers,\" said he.  \"Her heart\nhad a manifold adaptation; her constitution an infinite buoyancy, which\n(had she possessed only a little patience to await the reflux of her\ntroubles) would have borne her upward triumphantly for twenty years to\ncome.  Her beauty would not have waned--or scarcely so, and surely not\nbeyond the reach of art to restore it--in all that time.  She had\nlife's summer all before her, and a hundred varieties of brilliant\nsuccess.  What an actress Zenobia might have been!  It was one of her\nleast valuable capabilities.  How forcibly she might have wrought upon\nthe world, either directly in her own person, or by her influence upon\nsome man, or a series of men, of controlling genius!  Every prize that\ncould be worth a woman's having--and many prizes which other women are\ntoo timid to desire--lay within Zenobia's reach.\"\n\n\"In all this,\" I observed, \"there would have been nothing to satisfy\nher heart.\"\n\n\"Her heart!\" answered Westervelt contemptuously.  \"That troublesome\norgan (as she had hitherto found it) would have been kept in its due\nplace and degree, and have had all the gratification it could fairly\nclaim.  She would soon have established a control over it.  Love had\nfailed her, you say.  Had it never failed her before?  Yet she survived\nit, and loved again,--possibly not once alone, nor twice either.  And\nnow to drown herself for yonder dreamy philanthropist!\"\n\n\"Who are you,\" I exclaimed indignantly, \"that dare to speak thus of the\ndead?  You seem to intend a eulogy, yet leave out whatever was noblest\nin her, and blacken while you mean to praise.  I have long considered\nyou as Zenobia's evil fate.  Your sentiments confirm me in the idea,\nbut leave me still ignorant as to the mode in which you have influenced\nher life.  The connection may have been indissoluble, except by death.\nThen, indeed,--always in the hope of God's infinite mercy,--I cannot\ndeem it a misfortune that she sleeps in yonder grave!\"\n\n\"No matter what I was to her,\" he answered gloomily, yet without actual\nemotion.  \"She is now beyond my reach.  Had she lived, and hearkened to\nmy counsels, we might have served each other well.  But there Zenobia\nlies in yonder pit, with the dull earth over her. Twenty years of a\nbrilliant lifetime thrown away for a mere woman's whim!\"\n\nHeaven deal with Westervelt according to his nature and deserts!--that\nis to say, annihilate him.  He was altogether earthy, worldly, made for\ntime and its gross objects, and incapable--except by a sort of dim\nreflection caught from other minds--of so much as one spiritual idea.\nWhatever stain Zenobia had was caught from him; nor does it seldom\nhappen that a character of admirable qualities loses its better life\nbecause the atmosphere that should sustain it is rendered poisonous by\nsuch breath as this man mingled with Zenobia's. Yet his reflections\npossessed their share of truth.  It was a woeful thought, that a woman\nof Zenobia's diversified capacity should have fancied herself\nirretrievably defeated on the broad battlefield of life, and with no\nrefuge, save to fall on her own sword, merely because Love had gone\nagainst her.  It is nonsense, and a miserable wrong,--the result, like\nso many others, of masculine egotism,--that the success or failure of\nwoman's existence should be made to depend wholly on the affections,\nand on one species of affection, while man has such a multitude of\nother chances, that this seems but an incident.  For its own sake, if\nit will do no more, the world should throw open all its avenues to the\npassport of a woman's bleeding heart.\n\nAs we stood around the grave, I looked often towards Priscilla,\ndreading to see her wholly overcome with grief.  And deeply grieved, in\ntruth, she was.  But a character so simply constituted as hers has room\nonly for a single predominant affection.  No other feeling can touch\nthe heart's inmost core, nor do it any deadly mischief.  Thus, while we\nsee that such a being responds to every breeze with tremulous\nvibration, and imagine that she must be shattered by the first rude\nblast, we find her retaining her equilibrium amid shocks that might\nhave overthrown many a sturdier frame.  So with Priscilla; her one\npossible misfortune was Hollingsworth's unkindness; and that was\ndestined never to befall her, never yet, at least, for Priscilla has\nnot died.\n\nBut Hollingsworth!  After all the evil that he did, are we to leave him\nthus, blest with the entire devotion of this one true heart, and with\nwealth at his disposal to execute the long-contemplated project that\nhad led him so far astray?  What retribution is there here?  My mind\nbeing vexed with precisely this query, I made a journey, some years\nsince, for the sole purpose of catching a last glimpse of\nHollingsworth, and judging for myself whether he were a happy man or\nno.  I learned that he inhabited a small cottage, that his way of life\nwas exceedingly retired, and that my only chance of encountering him or\nPriscilla was to meet them in a secluded lane, where, in the latter\npart of the afternoon, they were accustomed to walk.  I did meet them,\naccordingly.  As they approached me, I observed in Hollingsworth's face\na depressed and melancholy look, that seemed habitual; the powerfully\nbuilt man showed a self-distrustful weakness, and a childlike or\nchildish tendency to press close, and closer still, to the side of the\nslender woman whose arm was within his.  In Priscilla's manner there\nwas a protective and watchful quality, as if she felt herself the\nguardian of her companion; but, likewise, a deep, submissive,\nunquestioning reverence, and also a veiled happiness in her fair and\nquiet countenance.\n\nDrawing nearer, Priscilla recognized me, and gave me a kind and\nfriendly smile, but with a slight gesture, which I could not help\ninterpreting as an entreaty not to make myself known to Hollingsworth.\nNevertheless, an impulse took possession of me, and compelled me to\naddress him.\n\n\"I have come, Hollingsworth,\" said I, \"to view your grand edifice for\nthe reformation of criminals.  Is it finished yet?\"\n\n\"No, nor begun,\" answered he, without raising his eyes.  \"A very small\none answers all my purposes.\"\n\nPriscilla threw me an upbraiding glance.  But I spoke again, with a\nbitter and revengeful emotion, as if flinging a poisoned arrow at\nHollingsworth's heart.\n\n\"Up to this moment,\" I inquired, \"how many criminals have you reformed?\"\n\n\"Not one,\" said Hollingsworth, with his eyes still fixed on the ground.\n\"Ever since we parted, I have been busy with a single murderer.\"\n\nThen the tears gushed into my eyes, and I forgave him; for I remembered\nthe wild energy, the passionate shriek, with which Zenobia had spoken\nthose words, \"Tell him he has murdered me!  Tell him that I'll haunt\nhim!\"--and I knew what murderer he meant, and whose vindictive shadow\ndogged the side where Priscilla was not.\n\nThe moral which presents itself to my reflections, as drawn from\nHollingsworth's character and errors, is simply this, that, admitting\nwhat is called philanthropy, when adopted as a profession, to be often\nuseful by its energetic impulse to society at large, it is perilous to\nthe individual whose ruling passion, in one exclusive channel, it thus\nbecomes.  It ruins, or is fearfully apt to ruin, the heart, the rich\njuices of which God never meant should be pressed violently out and\ndistilled into alcoholic liquor by an unnatural process, but should\nrender life sweet, bland, and gently beneficent, and insensibly\ninfluence other hearts and other lives to the same blessed end.  I see\nin Hollingsworth an exemplification of the most awful truth in Bunyan's\nbook of such, from the very gate of heaven there is a by-way to the pit!\n\nBut, all this while, we have been standing by Zenobia's grave.  I have\nnever since beheld it, but make no question that the grass grew all the\nbetter, on that little parallelogram of pasture land, for the decay of\nthe beautiful woman who slept beneath.  How Nature seems to love us!\nAnd how readily, nevertheless, without a sigh or a complaint, she\nconverts us to a meaner purpose, when her highest one--that of a\nconscious intellectual life and sensibility has been untimely balked!\nWhile Zenobia lived, Nature was proud of her, and directed all eyes\nupon that radiant presence, as her fairest handiwork.  Zenobia\nperished.  Will not Nature shed a tear?  Ah, no!--she adopts the\ncalamity at once into her system, and is just as well pleased, for\naught we can see, with the tuft of ranker vegetation that grew out of\nZenobia's heart, as with all the beauty which has bequeathed us no\nearthly representative except in this crop of weeds.  It is because the\nspirit is inestimable that the lifeless body is so little valued.\n\n\n\nXXIX. MILES COVERDALE'S CONFESSION\n\nIt remains only to say a few words about myself.  Not improbably, the\nreader might be willing to spare me the trouble; for I have made but a\npoor and dim figure in my own narrative, establishing no separate\ninterest, and suffering my colorless life to take its hue from other\nlives.  But one still retains some little consideration for one's self;\nso I keep these last two or three pages for my individual and sole\nbehoof.\n\nBut what, after all, have I to tell?  Nothing, nothing, nothing!  I\nleft Blithedale within the week after Zenobia's death, and went back\nthither no more.  The whole soil of our farm, for a long time\nafterwards, seemed but the sodded earth over her grave.  I could not\ntoil there, nor live upon its products.  Often, however, in these years\nthat are darkening around me, I remember our beautiful scheme of a\nnoble and unselfish life; and how fair, in that first summer, appeared\nthe prospect that it might endure for generations, and be perfected, as\nthe ages rolled away, into the system of a people and a world!  Were my\nformer associates now there,--were there only three or four of those\ntrue-hearted men still laboring in the sun,--I sometimes fancy that I\nshould direct my world-weary footsteps thitherward, and entreat them to\nreceive me, for old friendship's sake.  More and more I feel that we\nhad struck upon what ought to be a truth.  Posterity may dig it up, and\nprofit by it.  The experiment, so far as its original projectors were\nconcerned, proved, long ago, a failure; first lapsing into Fourierism,\nand dying, as it well deserved, for this infidelity to its own higher\nspirit.  Where once we toiled with our whole hopeful hearts, the town\npaupers, aged, nerveless, and disconsolate, creep sluggishly afield.\nAlas, what faith is requisite to bear up against such results of\ngenerous effort!\n\nMy subsequent life has passed,--I was going to say happily, but, at all\nevents, tolerably enough.  I am now at middle age, well, well, a step\nor two beyond the midmost point, and I care not a fig who knows it!--a\nbachelor, with no very decided purpose of ever being otherwise. I have\nbeen twice to Europe, and spent a year or two rather agreeably at each\nvisit.  Being well to do in the world, and having nobody but myself to\ncare for, I live very much at my ease, and fare sumptuously every day.\nAs for poetry, I have given it up, notwithstanding that Dr.\nGriswold--as the reader, of course, knows--has placed me at a fair\nelevation among our minor minstrelsy, on the strength of my pretty\nlittle volume, published ten years ago. As regards human progress (in\nspite of my irrepressible yearnings over the Blithedale reminiscences),\nlet them believe in it who can, and aid in it who choose.  If I could\nearnestly do either, it might be all the better for my comfort.  As\nHollingsworth once told me, I lack a purpose.  How strange!  He was\nruined, morally, by an overplus of the very same ingredient, the want\nof which, I occasionally suspect, has rendered my own life all an\nemptiness.  I by no means wish to die.  Yet, were there any cause, in\nthis whole chaos of human struggle, worth a sane man's dying for, and\nwhich my death would benefit, then--provided, however, the effort did\nnot involve an unreasonable amount of trouble--methinks I might be bold\nto offer up my life.  If Kossuth, for example, would pitch the\nbattlefield of Hungarian rights within an easy ride of my abode, and\nchoose a mild, sunny morning, after breakfast, for the conflict, Miles\nCoverdale would gladly be his man, for one brave rush upon the levelled\nbayonets.  Further than that, I should be loath to pledge myself.\n\nI exaggerate my own defects.  The reader must not take my own word for\nit, nor believe me altogether changed from the young man who once hoped\nstrenuously, and struggled not so much amiss.  Frostier heads than mine\nhave gained honor in the world; frostier hearts have imbibed new\nwarmth, and been newly happy.  Life, however, it must be owned, has\ncome to rather an idle pass with me.  Would my friends like to know\nwhat brought it thither?  There is one secret,--I have concealed it all\nalong, and never meant to let the least whisper of it escape,--one\nfoolish little secret, which possibly may have had something to do with\nthese inactive years of meridian manhood, with my bachelorship, with\nthe unsatisfied retrospect that I fling back on life, and my listless\nglance towards the future.  Shall I reveal it? It is an absurd thing\nfor a man in his afternoon,--a man of the world, moreover, with these\nthree white hairs in his brown mustache and that deepening track of a\ncrow's-foot on each temple,--an absurd thing ever to have happened, and\nquite the absurdest for an old bachelor, like me, to talk about.  But\nit rises to my throat; so let it come.\n\nI perceive, moreover, that the confession, brief as it shall be, will\nthrow a gleam of light over my behavior throughout the foregoing\nincidents, and is, indeed, essential to the full understanding of my\nstory.  The reader, therefore, since I have disclosed so much, is\nentitled to this one word more.  As I write it, he will charitably\nsuppose me to blush, and turn away my face:\n\nI--I myself--was in love--with--Priscilla!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Blithedale Romance, by Nathaniel Hawthorne\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BLITHEDALE ROMANCE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 2081.txt or 2081.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/0\/8\/2081\/\n\nProduced by Michael Pullen and Tom Gannett.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":785,"split":"train"}
