The city of Melbourne plays a significant role in the plot and, as the author describes: \"Over all the great city hung a cloud of smoke like a pall.\" The killer's identity is not as significant a revelation in the story as are the roles of the influential and secretive Frettlby family, and their secret: they have an illegitimate daughter living on the streets. The class divide between Melbourne's wealthy and less fortunate is addressed throughout the plot.\nThe protagonist in the novel is a policeman named Detective Gorby, who is given the task of solving the murder. As Hume describes the character's investigative skills: \"He looked keenly round the room, and his estimate of the dead man's character was formed at once.\" The author commented in a later introduction, \"All of the scenes in the book, especially the slums, are described from personal observation; and I passed a great many nights in Little Bourke Street, gathering material\".

Notwithstanding this, the present publishers\nhave the best of reasons for believing, that there are thousands of\npersons whom the book has never reached. The causes of this have\ndoubtless been many, but chief among them was the form of the\npublication itself. It is for this section of the public chiefly that\nthe present edition is issued. In placing it before my new readers, I\nhave been asked by the publishers thoroughly to revise the work, and,\nat the same time, to set at rest the many conflicting reports\nconcerning it and myself, which have been current since its initial\nissue. The first of these requests I have complied with, and the many\ntypographic, and other errors, which disfigured the first edition,\nhave, I think I can safely say, now disappeared. The second request I\nam about to fulfil; but, in order to do so, I must ask my readers to go\nback with me to the beginning of all things, so far as this special\nbook is concerned.\n\nThe writing of the book was due more to accident than to design. I was\nbent on becoming a dramatist, but, being quite unknown, I found it\nimpossible to induce the managers of the Melbourne Theatres to accept,\nor even to read a play. At length it occurred to me I might further my\npurpose by writing a novel. I should at all events secure a certain\namount of local attention. Up to that time I had written only one or\ntwo short stories, and the \"Cab\" was not only the first book I ever\npublished, but the first book I ever wrote; so to youth and lack of\nexperience must be ascribed whatever was wanting in the book. I repeat\nthat the story was written only to attract local attention, and no one\nwas more astonished than I when it passed beyond the narrow circle for\nwhich it had originally been intended.\n\nMy mind made up on this point, I enquired of a leading Melbourne\nbookseller what style of book he sold most of. He replied that the\ndetective stories of Gaboriau had a large sale; and as, at this time, I\nhad never even heard of this author, I bought all his works--eleven or\nthereabouts--and read them carefully. The style of these stories\nattracted me, and I determined to write a book of the same class;\ncontaining a mystery, a murder, and a description of low life in\nMelbourne. This was the origin of the \"Cab.\" The central idea i.e. the\nmurder in a cab--came to me while driving at a late hour to St. Kilda,\na suburb of Melbourne; but it took some time and much thought to work\nit out to a logical conclusion. I was two months sketching out the\nskeleton of the novel, but even so, when I had written it, the result\nproved unsatisfactory, for I found I had not sufficiently well\nconcealed the mystery upon which the whole interest of the book\ndepended. In the first draft I made Frettlby the criminal, but on\nreading over the M.S. I found that his guilt was so obvious that I\nwrote out the story for a second time, introducing the character of\nMoreland as a scape-goat. Mother Guttersnipe I unearthed in the slums\noff Little Bourke Street; and I gave what I am afraid was perhaps too\nvivid a picture of her language and personality. These I have toned\ndown in the present edition. Calton and the two lodging-house keepers\nwere actual personages whom I knew very well, and I do not think I have\nexaggerated their idiosyncracies, although many have, I believe,\ndoubted the existence of such oddities. All the scenes in the book,\nespecially the slums, are described from personal observation; and I\npassed a great many nights in Little Bourke Street, gathering material.\n\nHaving completed the book, I tried to get it published, but every one\nto whom I offered it refused even to look at the manuscript on the\nground that no Colonial could write anything worth reading. They gave\nno reason for this extraordinary opinion, but it was sufficient for\nthem, and they laughed to scorn the idea that any good could come out\nof Nazareth--i.e., the Colonies. The story thus being boycotted on all\nhands, I determined to publish it myself, and accordingly an edition\nof, I think, some five thousand copies was brought out at my own cost.\nContrary to the expectations of the publishers, and I must add to my\nown, the whole edition went off in three weeks, and the public demanded\na second. This also sold rapidly, and after some months, proposals were\nmade to me that the book should be brought out in London. Later on I\nparted with the book to several speculators, who formed themselves into\nwhat they called \"The Hansom Cab Publishing Company.\" Taking the book\nto London, they published it there with great success, and it had a\nphenomenal sale, which brought in a large sum of money. The success\nwas, in the first instance, due, in no small degree, to a very kind and\ngenerous criticism written by Mr. Clement Scott. I may here state that\nI had nothing to do with the Company, nor did I receive any money for\nthe English sale of the book beyond what I sold it for; and, as a\nmatter of fact, I did not arrive in England until a year after the\nnovel was published. I have heard it declared that the plot is founded\non a real criminal case; but such a statement is utterly without\nfoundation, as the story is pure fiction from beginning to end. Several\npeople before and since my arrival in England, have assumed the\nauthorship of the book to themselves; and one gentleman went so far as\nto declare that he would shoot me if I claimed to have written it. I am\nglad to say that up to the present he has not carried out his\nintention. Another individual had his cards printed, \"Fergus Hume.\nAuthor of 'The Mystery of a Hansom Cab,'\" and also added the price for\nwhich he was prepared to write a similar book. Many of the papers put\nthis last piece of eccentricity down to my account.\n\nI may state in conclusion, that I belong to New Zealand, and not to\nAustralia, that I am a barrister, and not a retired policeman, that I\nam yet two decades off fifty years of age, that Fergus Hume is my real\nname, and not a nom-de-plume; and finally, that far from making a\nfortune out of the book, all I received for the English and American\nrights, previous to the issue of this Revised Edition by my present\npublishers, was the sum of fifty pounds. With this I take my leave, and\nI trust that the present edition may prove as successful as did the\nfirst.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nWHAT THE ARGUS SAID.\n\n\nThe following report appeared in the Argus newspaper of Saturday, the\n28th July, 18--\n\n\"Truth is said to be stranger than fiction, and certainly the\nextraordinary murder which took place in Melbourne on Thursday night,\nor rather Friday morning, goes a long way towards verifying this\nsaying. A crime has been committed by an unknown assassin, within a\nshort distance of the principal streets of this great city, and is\nsurrounded by an inpenetrable mystery. Indeed, from the nature of the\ncrime itself, the place where it was committed, and the fact that the\nassassin has escaped without leaving a trace behind him, it would seem\nas though the case itself had been taken bodily from one of Gaboreau's\nnovels, and that his famous detective Lecoq alone would be able to\nunravel it. The facts of the case are simply these:--\n\n\"On the twenty-seventh day of July, at the hour of twenty minutes to\ntwo o'clock in the morning, a hansom cab drove up to the police station\nin Grey Street, St. Kilda, and the driver made the startling statement\nthat his cab contained the body of a man who he had reason to believe\nhad been murdered. Being taken into the presence of the inspector, the\ncabman, who gave his name as Malcolm Royston, related the following\nstrange story:--\n\n\"At the hour of one o'clock in the morning, he was driving down Collins\nStreet East, when, as he was passing the Burke and Wills' monument, he\nwas hailed by a gentleman standing at the corner by the Scotch Church.\nHe immediately drove up, and saw that the gentleman who hailed him was\nsupporting the deceased, who appeared to be intoxicated. Both were in\nevening dress, but the deceased had on no overcoat, while the other\nwore a short covert coat of a light fawn colour, which was open. As\nRoyston drove up, the gentleman in the light coat said, 'Look here,\ncabby, here's some fellow awfully tight, you'd better take him home!'\n\n\"Royston then asked him if the drunken man was his friend, but this the\nother denied, saying that he had just picked him up from the footpath,\nand did not know him from Adam. At this moment the deceased turned his\nface up to the light of the lamp under which both were standing, and\nthe other seemed to recognise him, for he recoiled a pace, letting the\ndrunken man fall in a heap on the pavement, and gasping out 'You?' he\nturned on his heel, and walked rapidly away down Russell Street in the\ndirection of Bourke Street.\n\n\"Royston was staring after him, and wondering at his strange conduct,\nwhen he was recalled to himself by the voice of the deceased, who had\nstruggled to his feet, and was holding on to the lamp-post, swaying to\nand fro. 'I wan' g'ome,' he said in a thick voice, 'St. Kilda.' He then\ntried to get into the cab, but was too drunk to do so, and finally sat\ndown again on the pavement. Seeing this, Royston got down, and lifting\nhim up, helped him into the cab with some considerable difficulty. The\ndeceased fell back into the cab, and seemed to drop off to sleep; so,\nafter closing the door, Royston turned to remount his driving-seat,\nwhen he found the gentleman in the light coat whom he had seen holding\nup the deceased, close to his elbow. Royston said, 'Oh, you've come\nback,' and the other answered, 'Yes, I've changed my mind, and will see\nhim home.' As he said this he opened the door of the cab, stepped in\nbeside the deceased, and told Royston to drive down to St. Kilda.\nRoyston, who was glad that the friend of the deceased had come to look\nafter him, drove as he had been directed, but near the Church of\nEngland Grammar School, on the St. Kilda Road, the gentleman in the\nlight coat called out to him to stop. He did so, and the gentleman got\nout of the cab, closing the door after him.\n\n\"'He won't let me take him home,' he said, 'so I'll just walk back to\nthe city, and you can drive him to St. Kilda.'\n\n\"'What street, sir?' asked Royston.\n\n\"'Grey Street, I fancy,' said the other, 'but my friend will direct you\nwhen you get to the Junction.' \"'Ain't he too much on, sir?' said\nRoyston, dubiously.\n\n\"'Oh, no! I think he'll be able to tell you where he lives--it's Grey\nStreet or Ackland Street, I fancy. I don't know which.'\n\n\"He then opened the door of the cab and looked in. 'Good night, old\nman,' he said--the other apparently did not answer, for the gentleman\nin the light coat, shrugging his shoulders, and muttering 'sulky\nbrute,' closed the door again. He then gave Royston half-a-sovereign,\nlit a cigarette, and after making a few remarks about the beauty of the\nnight, walked off quickly in the direction of Melbourne. Royston drove\ndown to the Junction, and having stopped there, according to his\ninstructions he asked his 'fare' several times where he was to drive\nhim to. Receiving no response and thinking that the deceased was too\ndrunk to answer, he got down from his seat, opened the door of the cab,\nand found the deceased lying back in the corner with a handkerchief\nacross his mouth. He put out his hand with the intention of rousing\nhim, thinking that he had gone to sleep. But on touching him the\ndeceased fell forward, and on examination, to his horror, he found that\nhe was quite dead. Alarmed at what had taken place, and suspecting the\ngentleman in the light coat, he drove to the police station at St.\nKilda, and there made the above report. The body of the deceased was\ntaken out of the cab and brought into the station, a doctor being sent\nfor at once. On his arrival, however, he found that life was quite\nextinct, and also discovered that the handkerchief which was tied\nlightly over the mouth was saturated with chloroform. He had no\nhesitation in stating that from the way in which the handkerchief was\nplaced, and the presence of chloroform, that a murder had been\ncommitted, and from all appearances the deceased died easily, and\nwithout a struggle. The deceased is a slender man, of medium height,\nwith a dark complexion, and is dressed in evening dress, which will\nrender identification difficult, as it is a costume which has no\ndistinctive mark to render it noticeable. There were no papers or cards\nfound on the deceased from which his name could be discovered, and the\nclothing was not marked in any way. The handkerchief, however, which\nwas tied across his mouth, was of white silk, and marked in one of the\ncorners with the letters 'O.W.' in red silk. The assassin, of course,\nmay have used his own handkerchief to commit the crime, so that if the\ninitials are those of his name they may ultimately lead to his\ndetection. There will be an inquest held on the body of the deceased\nthis morning, when, no doubt, some evidence may be elicited which may\nsolve the mystery.\"\n\nIn Monday morning's issue of the ARGUS the following article appeared\nwith reference to the matter:--\n\n\"The following additional evidence which has been obtained may throw\nsome light on the mysterious murder in a hansom cab of which we gave a\nfull description in Saturday's issue:--'Another hansom cabman called at\nthe police office, and gave a clue which will, no doubt, prove of value\nto the detectives in their search for the murderer. He states that he\nwas driving up the St. Kilda Road on Friday morning about half-past one\no'clock, when he was hailed by a gentleman in a light coat, who stepped\ninto the cab and told him to drive to Powlett Street, in East\nMelbourne. He did so, and, after paying him, the gentleman got out at\nthe corner of Wellington Parade and Powlett Street and walked slowly up\nPowlett Street, while the cab drove back to town. Here all clue ends,\nbut there can be no doubt in the minds of our readers as to the\nidentity of the man in the light coat who got out of Royston's cab on\nthe St. Kilda Road, with the one who entered the other cab and alighted\ntherefrom at Powlett Street. There could have been no struggle, as had\nany taken place the cabman, Royston, surely would have heard the noise.\nThe supposition is, therefore, that the deceased was too drunk to make\nany resistance, and that the other, watching his opportunity, placed\nthe handkerchief saturated with chloroform over the mouth of his\nvictim. Then after perhaps a few ineffectual struggles the latter would\nsuccumb to the effects of his inhalation. The man in the light coat,\njudging from his conduct before getting into the cab, appears to have\nknown the deceased, though the circumstance of his walking away on\nrecognition, and returning again, shows that his attitude towards the\ndeceased was not altogether a friendly one.\n\n\"The difficulty is where to start from in the search after the author\nof what appears to be a deliberate murder, as the deceased seems to be\nunknown, and his presumed murderer has escaped. But it is impossible\nthat the body can remain long without being identified by someone, as\nthough Melbourne is a large city, yet it is neither Paris nor London,\nwhere a man can disappear in a crowd and never be heard of again. The\nfirst thing to be done is to establish the identity of the deceased,\nand then, no doubt, a clue will be obtained leading to the detection of\nthe man in the light coat who appears to have been the perpetrator of\nthe crime. It is of the utmost importance that the mystery in which the\ncrime is shrouded should be cleared up, not only in the interests of\njustice, but also in those of the public--taking place as it did in a\npublic conveyance, and in the public street. To think that the author\nof such a crime is at present at large, walking in our midst, and\nperhaps preparing for the committal of another, is enough to shake the\nstrongest nerves. In one of Du Boisgobey's stories, entitled 'An\nOmnibus Mystery,' a murder closely resembling this tragedy takes place\nin an omnibus, but we question if even that author would have been\ndaring enough to write about a crime being committed in such an\nunlikely place as a hansom cab. Here is a great chance for some of our\ndetectives to render themselves famous, and we feel sure that they will\ndo their utmost to trace the author of this cowardly and dastardly\nmurder.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE EVIDENCE AT THE INQUEST.\n\n\nAt the inquest held on the body found in the hansom cab the following\narticles taken from the deceased were placed on the table:--\n\n1. Two pounds ten shillings in gold and silver.\n\n2. The white silk handkerchief which was saturated with chloroform, and\nwas found tied across the mouth of the deceased, marked with the\nletters O.W. in red silk.\n\n3. A cigarette case of Russian leather, half filled with \"Old Judge\"\ncigarettes. 4. A left-hand white glove of kid--rather soiled--with\nblack seams down the back. Samuel Gorby, of the detective office, was\npresent in order to see if anything might be said by the witnesses\nlikely to point to the cause or to the author of the crime.\n\nThe first witness called was Malcolm Royston, in whose cab the crime\nhad been committed. He told the same story as had already appeared in\nthe ARGUS, and the following facts were elicited by the Coroner:--\n\nQ. Can you give a description of the gentleman in the light coat, who\nwas holding the deceased when you drove up?\n\nA. I did not observe him very closely, as my attention was taken up by\nthe deceased; and, besides, the gentleman in the light coat was in the\nshadow.\n\nQ Describe him from what you saw of him.\n\nA. He was fair, I think, because I could see his moustache, rather\ntall, and in evening dress, with a light coat over it. I could not see\nhis face very plainly, as he wore a soft felt hat, which was pulled\ndown over his eyes.\n\nQ. What kind of hat was it he wore--a wide-awake?\n\nA. Yes. The brim was turned down, and I could see only his mouth and\nmoustache.\n\nQ. What did he say when you asked him if he knew the deceased?\n\nA. He said he didn't; that he had just picked him up.\n\nQ. And afterwards he seemed to recognise him?\n\nA. Yes. When the deceased looked up he said \"You!\" and let him fall on\nto the ground; then he walked away towards Bourke Street.\n\nQ. Did he look back?\n\nA. Not that I saw.\n\nQ. How long were you looking after him?\n\nA. About a minute.\n\nQ. And when did you see him again?\n\nA. After I put deceased into the cab I turned round and found him at my\nelbow.\n\nQ. And what did he say?\n\nA. I said, \"Oh! you've come back,\" and he said, \"Yes, I've changed my\nmind, and will see him home,\" and then he got into the cab, and told me\nto drive to St. Kilda.\n\nQ. He spoke then as if he knew the deceased?\n\nA. Yes; I thought that he recognised him only when he looked up, and\nperhaps having had a row with him walked away, but thought he'd come\nback.\n\nQ. Did you see him coming back?\n\nA. No; the first I saw of him was at my elbow when I turned.\n\nQ. And when did he get out? A. Just as I was turning down by the\nGrammar School on the St. Kilda Road.\n\nQ. Did you hear any sounds of fighting or struggling in the cab during\nthe drive?\n\nA. No; the road was rather rough, and the noise of the wheels going\nover the stones would have prevented my hearing anything.\n\nQ. When the gentleman in the light coat got out did he appear disturbed?\n\nA. No; he was perfectly calm.\n\nQ. How could you tell that?\n\nA. Because the moon had risen, and I could see plainly.\n\nQ. Did you see his face then?\n\nA. No; his hat was pulled down over it. I only saw as much as I did\nwhen he entered the cab in Collins Street.\n\nQ. Were his clothes torn or disarranged in any way?\n\nA. No; the only difference I remarked in him was that his coat was\nbuttoned.\n\nQ. And was it open when he got in?\n\nA. No; but it was when he was holding up the deceased.\n\nQ. Then he buttoned it before he came back and got into the cab?\n\nA. Yes. I suppose so.\n\nQ. What did he say when he got out of the cab on the St. Kilda Road?\n\nA. He said that the deceased would not let him take him home, and that\nhe would walk back to Melbourne.\n\nQ. And you asked him where you were to drive the deceased to?\n\nA. Yes; and he said that the deceased lived either in Grey Street or\nAckland Street, St. Kilda, but that the deceased would direct me at the\nJunction.\n\nQ. Did you not think that the deceased was too drunk to direct you?\n\nA. Yes, I did; but his friend said that the sleep and the shaking of\nthe cab would sober him a bit by the time I got to the Junction.\n\nQ. The gentleman in the light coat apparently did not know where the\ndeceased lived?\n\nA. No; he said it was either in Ackland Street or Grey Street.\n\nQ. Did you not think that curious?\n\nA. No; I thought he might be a club friend of the deceased.\n\nQ. For how long did the man in the light coat talk to you?\n\nA. About five minutes.\n\nQ. And during that time you heard no noise in the cab?\n\nA. No; I thought the deceased had gone to sleep.\n\nQ. And after the man in the light coat said \"good-night\" to the\ndeceased, what happened?\n\nA. He lit a cigarette, gave me a half-sovereign, and walked off towards\nMelbourne.\n\nQ. Did you observe if the gentleman in the light coat had his\nhandkerchief with him?\n\nA. Oh, yes; because he dusted his boots with it. The road was very\ndusty.\n\nQ. Did you notice any striking peculiarity about him?\n\nA. Well, no; except that he wore a diamond ring.\n\nQ. What was there peculiar about that?\n\nA. He wore it on the forefinger of the right hand, and I never saw it\nthat way before.\n\nQ. When did you notice this?\n\nA. When he was lighting his cigarette.\n\nQ. How often did you call to the deceased when you got to the Junction?\n\nA. Three or four times. I then got down, and found he was quite dead.\n\nQ. How was he lying?\n\nA. He was doubled up in the far corner of the cab, very much in the\nsame position as I left him when I put him in. His head was hanging on\none side, and there was a handkerchief across his mouth. When I touched\nhim he fell into the other corner of the cab, and then I found out he\nwas dead. I immediately drove to the St. Kilda police station and told\nthe police.\n\nAt the conclusion of Royston's evidence, during which Gorby had been\ncontinually taking notes, Robert Chinston was called. He deposed:--\n\nI am a duly qualified medical practitioner, residing in Collins Street\nEast. I made a POST-MORTEM examination of the body of the deceased on\nFriday.\n\nQ. That was within a few hours of his death?\n\nA. Yes, judging from the position of the handkerchief and the presence\nof chloroform that the deceased had died from the effects of\nANAESTHESIA, and knowing how rapidly the poison evaporates I made the\nexamination at once.\n\nCoroner: Go on, sir.\n\nDr. Chinston: Externally, the body was healthy-looking and well\nnourished. There were no marks of violence. The staining apparent at\nthe back of the legs and trunk was due to POST-MORTEM congestion.\nInternally, the brain was hyperaemic, and there was a considerable\namount of congestion, especially apparent in the superficial vessels.\nThere was no brain disease. The lungs were healthy, but slightly\ncongested. On opening the thorax there was a faint spirituous odour\ndiscernible. The stomach contained about a pint of completely digested\nfood. The heart was flaccid. The right-heart contained a considerable\nquantity of dark, fluid blood. There was a tendency to fatty\ndegeneration of that organ.\n\nI am of opinion that the deceased died from the inhalation of some such\nvapour as chloroform or methylene.\n\nQ. You say there was a tendency to fatty degeneration of the heart?\nWould that have anything to do with the death of deceased?\n\nA. Not of itself. But chloroform administered while the heart was in\nsuch a state would have a decided tendency to accelerate the fatal\nresult. At the same time, I may mention that the POST-MORTEM signs of\npoisoning by chloroform are mostly negative.\n\nDr. Chinston was then permitted to retire, and Clement Rankin, another\nhansom cabman, was called. He deposed: I am a cabman, living in\nCollingwood, and usually drive a hansom cab. I remember Thursday last.\nI had driven a party down to St. Kilda, and was returning about\nhalf-past one o'clock. A short distance past the Grammar School I was\nhailed by a gentleman in a light coat; he was smoking a cigarette, and\ntold me to drive him to Powlett Street, East Melbourne. I did so, and\nhe got out at the corner of Wellington Parade and Powlett Street. He\npaid me half-a-sovereign for my fare, and then walked up Powlett\nStreet, while I drove back to town.\n\nQ. What time was it when you stopped at Powlett Street?\n\nA. Two o'clock exactly.\n\nQ. How do you know?\n\nA. Because it was a still night, and I heard the Post Office clock\nstrike two o'clock.\n\nQ. Did you notice anything peculiar about the man in the light coat?\n\nA. No! He looked just the same as anyone else. I thought he was some\nswell of the town out for a lark. His hat was pulled down over his\neyes, and I could not see his face.\n\nQ. Did you notice if he wore a ring?\n\nA. Yes! I did. When he was handing me the half-sovereign, I saw he had\na diamond ring on the forefinger of his right hand.\n\nQ. He did not say why he was on the St. Kilda Road at such an hour?\n\nA. No! He did not.\n\nClement Rankin was then ordered to stand down, and the Coroner then\nsummed up in an address of half-an-hour's duration. There was, he\npointed out, no doubt that the death of the deceased had resulted not\nfrom natural causes, but from the effects of poisoning. Only slight\nevidence had been obtained up to the present time regarding the\ncircumstances of the case, but the only person who could be accused of\ncommitting the crime was the unknown man who entered the cab with the\ndeceased on Friday morning at the corner of the Scotch Church, near the\nBurke and Wills' monument. It had been proved that the deceased, when\nhe entered the cab, was, to all appearances, in good health, though in\na state of intoxication, and the fact that he was found by the cabman,\nRoyston, after the man in the light coat had left the cab, with a\nhandkerchief, saturated with chloroform, tied over his mouth, would\nseem to show that he had died through the inhalation of chloroform,\nwhich had been deliberately administered. All the obtainable evidence\nin the case was circumstantial, but, nevertheless, showed conclusively\nthat a crime had been committed. Therefore, as the circumstances of the\ncase pointed to one conclusion, the jury could not do otherwise than\nframe a verdict in accordance with that conclusion.\n\nThe jury retired at four o'clock, and, after an absence of a quarter of\nan hour, returned with the following verdict:--\n\n\"That the deceased, whose name there is no evidence to determine, died\non the 27th day of July, from the effects of poison, namely,\nchloroform, feloniously administered by some person unknown; and the\njury, on their oaths, say that the said unknown person feloniously,\nwilfully, and maliciously did murder the said deceased.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nONE HUNDRED POUNDS REWARD.\n\n\n  V.R.\n  MURDER.\n  100 POUNDS REWARD.\n\n\"Whereas, on Friday, the 27th day of July, the body of a man, name\nunknown, was found in a hansom cab. AND WHEREAS, at an inquest held at\nSt. Kilda, on the 30th day of July, a verdict of wilful murder, against\nsome person unknown, was brought in by the jury. The deceased is of\nmedium height, with a dark complexion, dark hair, clean shaved, has a\nmole on the left temple, and was dressed in evening dress. Notice is\nhereby given that a reward of 100 pounds will be paid by the Government\nfor such information as will lead to the conviction of the murderer,\nwho is presumed to be a man who entered the hansom cab with the\ndeceased at the corner of Collins and Russell Streets, on the morning\nof the 27th day of July.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nMR. GORBY MAKES A START.\n\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Gorby, addressing his reflection in the looking-glass,\n\"I've been finding out things these last twenty years, but this is a\npuzzler, and no mistake.\"\n\nMr. Gorby was shaving, and, as was his usual custom, conversed with his\nreflection. Being a detective, and of an extremely reticent\ndisposition, he never talked outside about his business, or made a\nconfidant of anyone. When he did want to unbosom himself, he retired to\nhis bedroom and talked to his reflection in the mirror. This method of\nprocedure he found to work capitally, for it relieved his sometimes\noverburdened mind with absolute security to himself. Did not the barber\nof Midas when he found out what was under the royal crown of his\nmaster, fret and chafe over his secret, until one morning he stole to\nthe reeds by the river, and whispered, \"Midas, has ass's ears?\" In the\nlike manner Mr. Gorby felt a longing at times to give speech to his\ninnermost secrets; and having no fancy for chattering to the air, he\nmade his mirror his confidant. So far it had never betrayed him, while\nfor the rest it joyed him to see his own jolly red face nodding gravely\nat him from out the shining surface, like a mandarin. This morning the\ndetective was unusually animated in his confidences to his mirror. At\ntimes, too, a puzzled expression would pass over his face. The hansom\ncab murder had been placed in his hands for solution, and he was trying\nto think how he should make a beginning.\n\n\"Hang it,\" he said, thoughtfully stropping his razor, \"a thing with an\nend must have a start, and if I don't get the start how am I to get the\nend?\"\n\nAs the mirror did not answer this question, Mr. Gorby lathered his\nface, and started shaving in a somewhat mechanical fashion, for his\nthoughts were with the case, and ran on in this manner:--\n\n\"Here's a man--well, say a gentleman--who gets drunk, and, therefore,\ndon't know what he's up to. Another gent who is on the square comes up\nand sings out for a cab for him--first he says he don't know him, and\nthen he shows plainly he does--he walks away in a temper, changes his\nmind, comes back and gets into the cab, after telling the cabby to\ndrive down to St. Kilda. Then he polishes the drunk one off with\nchloroform, gets out of the cab, jumps into another, and after getting\nout at Powlett Street, vanishes--that's the riddle I've got to find\nout, and I don't think the Sphinx ever had a harder one. There are\nthree things to be discovered--First, who is the dead man? Second, what\nwas he killed for? And third, who did it?\n\n\"Once I get hold of the first the other two won't be very hard to find\nout, for one can tell pretty well from a man's life whether it's to\nanyone's interest that he should be got off the books. The man that\nmurdered that chap must have had some strong motive, and I must find\nout what that motive was. Love? No, it wasn't that--men in love don't\ngo to such lengths in real life--they do in novels and plays, but I've\nnever seen it occurring in my experience. Robbery? No, there was plenty\nof money in his pocket. Revenge? Now, really it might be that--it's a\nkind of thing that carries most people further than they want to go.\nThere was no violence used, for his clothes weren't torn, so he must\nhave been taken sudden, and before he knew what the other chap was up\nto. By the way, I don't think I examined his clothes sufficiently,\nthere might be something about them to give a clue; at any rate it's\nworth looking after, so I'll start with his clothes.\"\n\nSo Mr. Gorby, having dressed and breakfasted, walked quickly to the\npolice station, where he asked for the clothes of the deceased to be\nshown to him. When he received them he retired into a corner, and\ncommenced an exhaustive examination of them.\n\nThere was nothing remarkable about the coat. It was merely a well-cut\nand well-made dress coat; so with a grunt of dissatisfaction Mr. Gorby\nthrew it aside, and picked up the waistcoat. Here he found something to\ninterest him, in the shape of a pocket made on the left-hand side and\non the inside, of the garment.\n\n\"Now, what the deuce is this for?\" said Mr. Gorby, scratching his head;\n\"it ain't usual for a dress waistcoat to have a pocket on its inside as\nI'm aware of; and,\" continued the detective, greatly excited, \"this\nain't tailor's work, he did it himself, and jolly badly he did it too.\nNow he must have taken the trouble to make this pocket himself, so that\nno one else would know anything about it, and it was made to carry\nsomething valuable--so valuable that he had to carry it with him even\nwhen he wore evening clothes. Ah! here's a tear on the side nearest the\noutside of the waistcoat; something has been pulled out roughly. I\nbegin to see now. The dead man possessed something which the other man\nwanted, and which he knew the dead one carried about with him. He sees\nhim drunk, gets into the cab with him, and tries to get what he wants.\nThe dead man resists, upon which the other kills him by means of the\nchloroform which he had with him, and being afraid that the cab will\nstop, and he will be found out, snatches what he wants out of the\npocket so quickly that he tears the waistcoat and then makes off.\nThat's clear enough, but the question is, What was it he wanted? A case\nwith jewels? No! It could not have been anything so bulky, or the dead\nman would never have carried it about inside his waistcoat. It was\nsomething flat, which could easily lie in the pocket--a paper--some\nvaluable paper which the assassin wanted, and for which he killed the\nother.\"\n\n\"This is all very well,\" said Mr. Gorby, throwing down the waistcoat,\nand rising. \"I have found number two before number one. The first\nquestion is: Who is the murdered man. He's a stranger in Melbourne,\nthat's pretty clear, or else some one would have been sure to recognise\nhim before now by the description given in the reward. Now, I wonder if\nhe has any relations here? No, he can't, or else they would have made\nenquiries, before this. Well, there's one thing certain, he must have\nhad a landlady or landlord, unless he slept in the open air. He can't\nhave lived in an hotel, as the landlord of any hotel in Melbourne would\nhave recognised him from the description, especially when the whole\nplace is ringing with the murder. Private lodgings more like, and a\nlandlady who doesn't read the papers and doesn't gossip, or she'd have\nknown all about it by this time. Now, if he did live, as I think, in\nprivate lodgings, and suddenly disappeared, his landlady wouldn't keep\nquiet. It's a whole week since the murder, and as the lodger has not\nbeen seen or heard of, the landlady will naturally make enquiries. If,\nhowever, as I surmise, the lodger is a stranger, she will not know\nwhere to enquire; therefore, under these circumstances, the most\nnatural thing for her to do would be to advertise for him, so I'll have\na look at the newspapers.\"\n\nMr. Gorby got a file of the different newspapers, and looked carefully\nthrough those columns in which missing friends and people who will hear\n\"something to their advantage\" are generally advertised for.\n\n\"He was murdered,\" said Mr. Gorby to himself, \"on a Friday morning,\nbetween one and two o'clock, so he might stay away till Monday without\nexciting any suspicion. On Monday, however, the landlady would begin to\nfeel uneasy, and on Tuesday she would advertise for him. Therefore,\"\nsaid Mr. Gorby, running his fat finger down the column, \"Wednesday it\nis.\"\n\nIt did not appear in Wednesday's paper, neither did it in Thursday's,\nbut in Friday's issue, exactly one week after the murder, Mr. Gorby\nsuddenly came upon the following advertisement:--\n\n\"If Mr. Oliver Whyte does not return to Possum Villa, Grey Street, St.\nKilda, before the end of the week, his rooms will be let again.--\nRubina Hableton.\"\n\n\"Oliver Whyte,\" repeated Mr. Gorby slowly, \"and the initials on the\npocket-handkerchief which was proved to have belonged to the deceased\nwere 'O.W.' So his name is Oliver Whyte, is it? Now, I wonder if Rubina\nHableton knows anything about this matter. At any rate,\" said Mr.\nGorby, putting on his hat, \"as I'm fond of sea breezes, I think I'll go\ndown, and call at Possum Villa, Grey Street, St. Kilda.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nMRS. HAMILTON UNBOSOMS HERSELF.\n\n\nMrs. Hableton was a lady with a grievance, as anybody who happened to\nbecome acquainted with her, soon found out. It is Beaconsfield who\nsays, in one of his novels, that no one is so interesting as when he is\ntalking about himself; and, judging Mrs. Hableton by this statement,\nshe was an extremely fascinating individual, as she never by any chance\ntalked upon any other subject. What was the threat of a Russian\ninvasion to her so long as she had her special grievance--once let that\nbe removed, and she would have time to attend to such minor details as\naffected the colony.\n\nMrs. Hableton's particular grievance was want of money. Not by any\nmeans an uncommon one, you might remind her; but she snappishly would\ntell you that \"she knowd that, but some people weren't like other\npeople.\" In time one came to learn what she meant by this. She had come\nto the Colonies in the early days--days when the making of money in\nappreciable quantity was an easier matter than it is now. Owing to a\nbad husband, she had failed to save any. The late Mr. Hableton--for he\nhad long since departed this life--had been addicted to alcohol, and at\nthose times when he should have been earning, he was usually to be\nfound in a drinking shanty spending his wife's earnings in \"shouting\"\nfor himself and his friends. The constant drinking, and the hot\nVictorian climate, soon carried him off, and when Mrs. Hableton had\nseen him safely under the ground in the Melbourne Cemetery, she\nreturned home to survey her position, and see how it could be bettered.\nShe gathered together a little money from the wreck of her fortune, and\nland being cheap, purchased a small \"section\" at St. Kilda, and built a\nhouse on it. She supported herself by going out charing, taking in\nsewing, and acting as a sick nurse, So, among this multiplicity of\noccupations, she managed to exist fairly well.\n\nAnd in truth it was somewhat hard upon Mrs. Hableton. For at the time\nwhen she should have been resting and reaping the fruit of her early\nindustry, she was obliged to toil more assiduously than ever. It was\nlittle consolation to her that she was but a type of many women, who,\nhardworking and thrifty themselves, are married to men who are nothing\nbut an incubus to their wives and to their families. Small wonder,\nthen, that Mrs. Hableton should condense all her knowledge of the male\nsex into the one bitter aphorism, \"Men is brutes.\"\n\nPossum Villa was an unpretentious-looking place, with one bow-window\nand a narrow verandah in front. It was surrounded by a small garden in\nwhich were a few sparse flowers--the especial delight of Mrs. Hableton.\nIt was her way to tie an old handkerchief round her head and to go out\ninto the garden and dig and water her beloved flowers until, from sheer\ndesperation at the overwhelming odds, they gave up all attempt to grow.\nShe was engaged in this favourite occupation about a week after her\nlodger had gone. She wondered where he was.\n\n\"Lyin' drunk in a public-'ouse, I'll be bound,\" she said, viciously\npulling up a weed, \"a-spendin' 'is, rent and a-spilin' 'is inside with\nbeer--ah, men is brutes, drat 'em!\"\n\nJust as she said this, a shadow fell across the garden, and on looking\nup, she saw a man leaning over the fence, staring at her.\n\n\"Git out,\" she said, sharply, rising from her knees and shaking her\ntrowel at the intruder. \"I don't want no apples to-day, an' I don't\ncare how cheap you sells 'em.\"\n\nMrs. Hableton evidently laboured under the delusion that the man was a\nhawker, but seeing no hand-cart with him, she changed her mind.\n\n\"You're takin' a plan of the 'ouse to rob it, are you?\" she said.\n\"Well, you needn't, 'cause there ain't nothin' to rob, the silver\nspoons as belonged to my father's mother 'avin' gone down my 'usband's,\nthroat long ago, an' I ain't 'ad money to buy more. I'm a lone pusson\nas is put on by brutes like you, an' I'll thank you to leave the fence\nI bought with my own 'ard earned money alone, and git out.\"\n\nMrs. Hableton stopped short for want of breath, and stood shaking her\ntrowel, and gasping like a fish out of water.\n\n\"My dear lady,\" said the man at the fence, mildly, \"are you--\"\n\n\"No, I ain't,\" retorted Mrs. Hableton, fiercely, \"I ain't neither a\nmember of the 'Ouse, nor a school teacher, to answer your questions.\nI'm a woman as pays my rates an' taxes, and don't gossip nor read yer\nrubbishin' newspapers, nor care for the Russings, no how, so git out.\"\n\n\"Don't read the papers?\" repeated the man, in a satisfied tone, \"ah!\nthat accounts for it.\"\n\nMrs. Hableton stared suspiciously at the intruder. He was a\nburly-looking man, with a jovial red face, clean shaven, and his sharp,\nshrewd-looking grey eyes twinkled like two stars. He was well-dressed\nin a suit of light clothes, and wore a stiffly-starched white\nwaistcoat, with a massive gold chain stretched across it. Altogether he\ngave Mrs. Hableton finally the impression of being a well-to-do\ntradesman, and she mentally wondered what he wanted.\n\n\"What d'y want?\" she asked, abruptly.\n\n\"Does Mr. Oliver Whyte live here?\" asked the stranger.\n\n\"He do, an' he don't,\" answered Mrs. Hableton, epigrammatically. \"I\nain't seen 'im for over a week, so I s'pose 'e's gone on the drink,\nlike the rest of 'em, but I've put sumthin' in the paper as 'ill pull\nhim up pretty sharp, and let 'im know I ain't a carpet to be trod on,\nan' if you're a friend of 'im, you can tell 'im from me 'e's a brute,\nan' it's no more but what I expected of 'im, 'e bein' a male.\"\n\nThe stranger waited placidly during the outburst, and Mrs. Hableton,\nhaving stopped for want of breath, he interposed, quietly--\n\n\"Can I speak to you for a few moments?\"\n\n\"An' who's a-stoppin' of you?\" said Mrs. Hableton, defiantly. \"Go on\nwith you, not as I expects the truth from a male, but go on.\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the other, looking up at the cloudless blue sky,\nand wiping his face with a gaudy red silk pocket-handkerchief, \"it is\nrather hot, you know, and--\"\n\nMrs. Hableton did not give him time to finish, but walking to the gate,\nopened it with a jerk.\n\n\"Use your legs and walk in,\" she said, and the stranger having done so,\nshe led the way into the house, and into a small neat sitting-room,\nwhich seemed to overflow with antimacassars, wool mats, and wax\nflowers. There were also a row of emu eggs on the mantelpiece, a\ncutlass on the wall, and a grimy line of hard-looking little books, set\nin a stiff row on a shelf, presumably for ornament, for their\nappearance in no way tempted one to read them.\n\nThe furniture was of horsehair, and everything was hard and shiny, so\nwhen the stranger sat down in the slippery-looking arm-chair that Mrs.\nHableton pushed towards him; he could not help thinking it had been\nstuffed with stones, it felt so cold and hard. The lady herself sat\nopposite to him in another hard chair, and having taken the\nhandkerchief off her head, folded it carefully, laid it on her lap, and\nthen looked straight at her unexpected visitor.\n\n\"Now then,\" she said, letting her mouth fly open so rapidly that it\ngave one the impression that it was moved by strings like a marionette,\n\"Who are you? what are you? and what do you want?\"\n\nThe stranger put his red silk handkerchief into his hat, placed it on\nthe table, and answered deliberately--\n\n\"My name is Gorby. I am a detective. I want Mr. Oliver Whyte.\"\n\n\"He ain't here,\" said Mrs. Hableton, thinking that Whyte had got into\ntrouble, and was in danger of arrest.\n\n\"I know that,\" answered Mr. Gorby.\n\n\"Then where is 'e?\"\n\nMr. Gorby answered abruptly, and watched the effect of his words.\n\n\"He is dead.\"\n\nMrs. Hableton grew pale, and pushed back her chair. \"No,\" she cried,\n\"he never killed 'im, did 'e?\"\n\n\"Who never killed him?\" queried Mr. Gorby, sharply.\n\nMrs. Hableton evidently knew more than she intended to say, for,\nrecovering herself with a violent effort, she answered evasively--\n\n\"He never killed himself.\"\n\nMr. Gorby looked at her keenly, and she returned his gaze with a\ndefiant stare.\n\n\"Clever,\" muttered the detective to himself; \"knows something more than\nshe chooses to tell, but I'll get it out of her.\" He paused a moment,\nand then went on smoothly:\n\n\"Oh, no! he did not commit suicide; what makes you think so?\" Mrs.\nHableton did not answer, but, rising from her seat, went over to a hard\nand shiny-looking sideboard, from whence she took a bottle of brandy\nand a small wine-glass. Half filling the glass, she drank it off, and\nreturned to her seat.\n\n\"I don't take much of that stuff,\" she said, seeing the detective's\neyes fixed curiously on her, \"but you 'ave given me such a turn that I\nmust take something to steady my nerves; what do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"Tell me all you know,\" said Mr. Gorby, keeping his eyes fixed on her\nface.\n\n\"Where was Mr. Whyte killed?\" she asked.\n\n\"He was murdered in a hansom cab on the St. Kilda Road.\"\n\n\"In the open street?\" she asked in a startled tone.\n\n\"Yes, in the open street.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" she drew a long breath, and closed her lips, firmly. Mr. Gorby\nsaid nothing. He saw that she was deliberating whether or not to speak,\nand a word from him might seal her lips, so, like a wise man, he kept\nsilent. He obtained his reward sooner than he expected.\n\n\"Mr. Gorby,\" she said at length, \"I 'ave 'ad a 'ard struggle all my\nlife, which it came along of a bad husband, who was a brute and a\ndrunkard, so, God knows, I ain't got much inducement to think well of\nthe lot of you, but--murder,\" she shivered slightly, though the room\nwas quite warm, \"I didn't think of that.\"\n\n\"In connection with whom?\"\n\n\"Mr. Whyte, of course,\" she answered, hurriedly.\n\n\"And who else?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Then there is nobody else?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know--I'm not sure.\"\n\nThe detective was puzzled.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked.\n\n\"I will tell you all I know,\" said Mrs. Hableton, \"an' if 'e's\ninnocent, God will 'elp 'im.\"\n\n\"If who is innocent?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you everythin' from the start,\" said Mrs. Hableton, \"an' you\ncan judge for yourself.\"\n\nMr. Gorby assented, and she began:\n\n\"It's only two months ago since I decided to take in lodgers; but\ncharin's 'ard work, and sewin's tryin' for the eyes, so, bein' a lone\nwoman, 'avin' bin badly treated by a brute, who is now dead, which I\nwas allays a good wife to 'im, I thought lodgers 'ud 'elp me a little,\nso I put a notice in the paper, an' Mr. Oliver Whyte took the rooms two\nmonths ago.\"\n\n\"What was he like?\"\n\n\"Not very tall, dark face, no whiskers nor moustache, an' quite the\ngentleman.\"\n\n\"Anything peculiar about him?\"\n\nMrs. Hableton thought for a moment.\n\n\"Well,\" she said at length, \"he 'ad a mole on his left temple, but it\nwas covered with 'is 'air, an' few people 'ud 'ave seen it.\"\n\n\"The very man,\" said Gorby to himself, \"I'm on the right path.\"\n\n\"Mr. Whyte said 'e 'ad just come from England,\" went on the woman.\n\n\"Which,\" thought Mr. Gorby, \"accounts for the corpse not being\nrecognised by friends.\"\n\n\"He took the rooms, an' said 'e'd stay with me for six months, an' paid\na week's rent in advance, an' 'e allays paid up reg'ler like a\nrespectable man, tho' I don't believe in 'em myself. He said 'e'd lots\nof friends, an' used to go out every night.\"\n\n\"Who were his friends?\"\n\n\"That I can't tell you, for 'e were very close, an' when 'e went out of\ndoors I never knowd where 'e went, which is jest like 'em; for they ses\nthey're goin' to work, an' you finds 'em in the beershop. Mr. Whyte\ntold me 'e was a-goin' to marry a heiress, 'e was.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" interjected Mr. Gorby, sapiently.\n\n\"He 'ad only one friend as I ever saw--a Mr. Moreland--who comed 'ere\nwith 'm, an' was allays with 'im--brother-like.\"\n\n\"What is this Mr. Moreland like?\"\n\n\"Good-lookin' enough,\" said Mrs. Hableton sourly, \"but 'is 'abits\nweren't as good as 'is face--'andsom is as 'andsom does, is what I ses.\"\n\n\"I wonder if he knows anything about this affair,\" thought Gorby to\nhimself \"Where is Mr. Moreland to be found?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not knowin', can't tell,\" retorted the landlady, \"'e used to be 'ere\nreg'lar, but I ain't seen 'im for over a week.\"\n\n\"Strange! very!\" said Gorby, shaking his head. \"I should like to see\nthis Mr. Moreland. I suppose it's probable he'll call again?\"\n\n\"'Abit bein' second nature I s'pose he will,\" answered the woman, \"'e\nmight call at any time, mostly 'avin' called at night.\"\n\n\"Ah! then I'll come down this evening on chance of seeing him,\" replied\nthe detective. \"Coincidences happen in real life as well as in novels,\nand the gentleman in question may turn up in the nick of time. Now,\nwhat else about Mr. Whyte?\"\n\n\"About two weeks ago, or three, I'm not cert'in which, a gentleman\ncalled to see Mr. Whyte; 'e was very tall, and wore a light coat.\"\n\n\"Ah! a morning coat?\"\n\n\"No! 'e was in evenin' dress, and wore a light coat over it, an' a soft\n'at.\"\n\n\"The very man,\" said the detective below his breath; \"go on.\"\n\n\"He went into Mr. Whyte's room, an' shut the door. I don't know how\nlong they were talkin' together; but I was sittin' in this very room\nand heard their voices git angry, and they were a-swearin' at one\nanother, which is the way with men, the brutes. I got up and went into\nthe passage in order to ask 'em not to make such a noise, when Mr.\nWhyte's door opens, an' the gentleman in the light coat comes out, and\nbangs along to the door. Mr. Whyte 'e comes to the door of 'is room,\nan' 'e 'ollers out. 'She is mine; you can't do anything; an' the other\nturns with 'is 'and on the door an' says, 'I can kill you, an' if you\nmarry 'er I'll do it, even in the open street.'\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Gorby, drawing a long breath, \"and then?\"\n\n\"Then he bangs the door to, which it's never shut easy since, an' I\nain't got no money to get it put right, an' Mr. Whyte walks back to his\nroom, laughing.\"\n\n\"Did he make any remark to you?\"\n\n\"No; except he'd been worried by a loonatic.\"\n\n\"And what was the stranger's name?\"\n\n\"That I can't tell you, as Mr. Whyte never told me. He was very tall,\nwith a fair moustache, an' dressed as I told you.\"\n\nMr. Gorby was satisfied.\n\n\"That is the man,\" he said to himself, \"who got into the hansom cab,\nand murdered Whyte; there's no doubt of it! Whyte and he were rivals\nfor the heiress.\"\n\n\"What d'y think of it?\" said Mrs. Hableton curiously.\n\n\"I think,\" said Mr. Gorby slowly, with his eyes fixed on her, \"I think\nthat there is a woman at the bottom of this crime.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nMR. GORBY MAKES FURTHER DISCOVERIES.\n\n\nWhen Mr. Gorby left Possum Villa no doubt remained in his mind as to\nwho had committed the murder. The gentleman in the light coat had\nthreatened to murder Whyte, even in the open street--these last words\nbeing especially significant--and there was no doubt that he had\ncarried out his threat. The committal of the crime was merely the\nfulfilment of the words uttered in anger. What the detective had now to\ndo was to find who the gentleman in the light coat was, where he lived,\nand, that done, to ascertain his doings on the night of the murder.\nMrs. Hableton had described him, but was ignorant of his name, and her\nvery vague description might apply to dozens of young men in Melbourne.\nThere was only one person who, in Mr. Gorby's opinion, could tell the\nname of the gentleman in the light coat, and that was Moreland, the\nintimate friend of the dead man. They appeared, from the landlady's\ndescription, to have been so friendly that it was more than likely\nWhyte would have told Moreland all about his angry visitor. Besides,\nMoreland's knowledge of his dead friend's life and habits might be able\nto supply information on two points, namely, who was most likely to\ngain by Whyte's death, and who the heiress was that the deceased\nboasted he would marry. But the fact that Moreland should be ignorant\nof his friend's tragic death, notwithstanding that the papers were full\nof it, and that the reward gave an excellent description of his\npersonal appearance, greatly puzzled Gorby.\n\nThe only way in which to account for Moreland's extraordinary silence\nwas that he was out of town, and had neither seen the papers nor heard\nanyone talking about the murder. If this were the case he might either\nstay away for an indefinite time or return after a few days. At all\nevents it was worth while going down to St. Kilda in the evening on the\nchance that Moreland might have returned to town, and would call to see\nhis friend. So, after his tea, Mr. Gorby put on his hat, and went down\nto Possum Villa, on what he could not help acknowledging to himself was\na very slender possibility.\n\nMrs. Hableton opened the door for him, and in silence led the way, not\ninto her own sitting-room, but into a much more luxuriously furnished\napartment, which Gorby guessed at once was that of Whyte's. He looked\nkeenly round the room, and his estimate of the dead man's character was\nformed at once.\n\n\"Fast,\" he said to himself, \"and a spendthrift. A man who would have\nhis friends, and possibly his enemies, among a very shady lot of\npeople.\"\n\nWhat led Mr. Gorby to this belief was the evidence which surrounded him\nof Whyte's mode of life. The room was well furnished, the furniture\nbeing covered with dark-red velvet, while the curtains on the windows\nand the carpet were all of the same somewhat sombre hue.\n\n\"I did the thing properly,\" observed Mrs. Hableton, with a satisfactory\nsmile on her hard face. \"When you wants young men to stop with you, the\nrooms must be well furnished, an' Mr. Whyte paid well, tho' 'e was\nrather pertickler about 'is food, which I'm only a plain cook, an'\ncan't make them French things which spile the stomach.\"\n\nThe globes of the gas lamps were of a pale pink colour, and Mrs.\nHableton having lit the gas in expectation of Mr. Gorby's arrival,\nthere was a soft roseate hue through the room. Mr. Gorby put his hands\nin his capacious pockets, and strolled leisurely through the room,\nexamining everything with a curious eye. The walls were covered with\npictures of celebrated horses and famous jockeys. Alternating with\nthese were photographs of ladies of the stage, mostly London actresses,\nNellie Farren, Kate Vaughan, and other burlesque stars, evidently being\nthe objects of the late Mr. Whyte's adoration. Over the mantelpiece\nhung a rack of pipes, above which were two crossed foils, and under\nthese a number of plush frames of all colours, with pretty faces\nsmiling out of them; a remarkable fact being, that all the photographs\nwere of ladies, and not a single male face was to be seen, either on\nthe walls or in the plush frames.\n\n\"Fond of the ladies, I see,\" said Mr. Gorby, nodding his head towards\nthe mantelpiece.\n\n\"A set of hussies,\" said Mrs. Hableton grimly, closing her lips\ntightly. \"I feel that ashamed when I dusts 'em as never was--I don't\nbelieve in gals gettin' their picters taken with 'ardly any clothes on,\nas if they just got out of bed, but Mr. Whyte seems to like 'em.\"\n\n\"Most young men do,\" answered Mr. Gorby dryly, going over to the\nbookcase.\n\n\"Brutes,\" said the lady of the house. \"I'd drown 'em in the Yarrer, I\nwould, a settin' 'emselves and a callin' 'emselves lords of creation,\nas if women were made for nothin' but to earn money 'an see 'em drink\nit, as my 'usband did, which 'is inside never seemed to 'ave enough\nbeer, an' me a poor lone woman with no family, thank God, or they'd\n'ave taken arter their father in 'is drinkin' 'abits.\"\n\nMr. Gorby took no notice of this tirade against men, but stood looking\nat Mr. Whyte's library, which seemed to consist mostly of French novels\nand sporting newspapers.\n\n\"Zola,\" said Mr. Gorby, thoughtfully, taking down a flimsy yellow book\nrather tattered. \"I've heard of him; if his novels are as bad as his\nreputation I shouldn't care to read them.\"\n\nHere a knock came at the front door, loud and decisive. On hearing it\nMrs. Hableton sprang hastily to her feet. \"That may be Mr. Moreland,\"\nshe said, as the detective quickly replaced \"Zola\" in the bookcase. \"I\nnever 'ave visitors in the evenin', bein' a lone widder, and if it is\n'im I'll bring 'im in 'ere.\"\n\nShe went out, and presently Gorby, who was listening intently, heard a\nman's voice ask if Mr. Whyte was at home.\n\n\"No, sir, he ain't,\" answered the landlady; \"but there's a gentleman in\nhis room askin' after 'im. Won't you come in, sir?\"\n\n\"For a rest, yes,\" returned the visitor, and immediately afterwards\nMrs. Hableton appeared, ushering in the late Oliver Whyte's most\nintimate friend. He was a tall, slender man, with a pink and white\ncomplexion, curly fair hair, and a drooping straw-coloured\nmoustache--altogether a strikingly aristocratic individual. He was\nwell-dressed in a suit of check, and had a cool, nonchalant air about\nhim.\n\n\"And where is Mr. Whyte to-night?\" he asked, sinking into a chair, and\ntaking no more notice of the detective than if he had been an article\nof furniture.\n\n\"Haven't you seen him lately?\" asked the detective quickly. Mr.\nMoreland stared in an insolent manner at his questioner for a few\nmoments, as if he were debating the advisability of answering or not.\nAt last he apparently decided that he would, for slowly pulling off one\nglove he leaned back in his chair.\n\n\"No, I have not,\" he said with a yawn. \"I have been up the country for\na few days, and arrived back only this evening, so I have not seen him\nfor over a week. Why do you ask?\"\n\nThe detective did not answer, but stood looking at the young man before\nhim in a thoughtful manner.\n\n\"I hope,\" said Mr. Moreland, nonchalantly, \"I hope you will know me\nagain, my friend, but I didn't know Whyte had started a lunatic asylum\nduring my absence. Who are you?\"\n\nMr. Gorby came forward and stood under the gas light.\n\n\"My name is Gorby, sir, and I am a detective,\" he said quietly.\n\n\"Ah! indeed,\" said Moreland, coolly looking him up and down. \"What has\nWhyte been doing; running away with someone's wife, eh? I know he has\nlittle weaknesses of that sort.\"\n\nGorby shook his head.\n\n\"Do you know where Mr. Whyte is to be found?\" he asked, cautiously.\n\nMoreland laughed.\n\n\"Not I, my friend,\" said he, lightly. \"I presume he is somewhere about\nhere, as these are his head-quarters. What has he been doing? Nothing\nthat can surprise me, I assure you--he was always an erratic\nindividual, and--\"\n\n\"He paid reg'ler,\" interrupted Mrs. Hableton, pursing up her lips.\n\n\"A most enviable reputation to possess,\" answered the other with a\nsneer, \"and one I'm afraid I'll never enjoy. But why all this\nquestioning about Whyte? What's the matter with him?\"\n\n\"He's dead!\" said Gorby, abruptly.\n\nAll Moreland's nonchalance vanished on hearing this, and he started up\nfrom his chair.\n\n\"Dead,\" he repeated mechanically. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that Mr. Oliver Whyte was murdered in a hansom cab.\" Moreland\nstared at the detective in a puzzled sort of way, and passed his hand\nacross his forehead.\n\n\"Excuse me, my head is in a whirl,\" he said, as he sat down again.\n\"Whyte murdered! He was all right when I left him nearly two weeks ago.\"\n\n\"Haven't you seen the papers?\" asked Gorby.\n\n\"Not for the last two weeks,\" replied Moreland. \"I have been up\ncountry, and it was only on arriving back in town to-night that I heard\nabout the murder at all, as my landlady gave me a garbled account of\nit, but I never for a moment connected it with Whyte, and I came down\nhere to see him, as I had agreed to do when I left. Poor fellow! poor\nfellow! poor fellow!\" and much overcome, he buried his face in his\nhands.\n\nMr. Gorby was touched by his evident distress, and even Mrs. Hableton\npermitted a small tear to roll down one hard cheek as a tribute of\nsorrow and sympathy. Presently Moreland raised his head, and spoke to\nGorby in a husky tone.\n\n\"Tell me all about it,\" he said, leaning his cheek on his hand.\n\"Everything you know.\"\n\nHe placed his elbows on the table, and buried his face in his hands\nagain, while the detective sat down and related all that he knew about\nWhyte's murder. When it was done he lifted up his head, and looked\nsadly at the detective.\n\n\"If I had been in town,\" he said, \"this would not have happened, for I\nwas always beside Whyte.\"\n\n\"You knew him very well, sir?\" said the detective, in a sympathetic\ntone.\n\n\"We were like brothers,\" replied Moreland, mournfully.\n\n\"I came out from England in the same steamer with him, and used to\nvisit him constantly here.\"\n\nMrs. Hableton nodded her head to imply that such was the case.\n\n\"In fact,\" said Mr. Moreland, after a moment's thought, \"I believe I\nwas with him on the night he was murdered.\"\n\nMrs. Hableton gave a slight scream, and threw her apron over her face,\nbut the detective sat unmoved, though Moreland's last remark had\nstartled him considerably.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" said Moreland, turning to Mrs. Hableton.\n\n\"Don't be afraid; I didn't kill him--no--but I met him last Thursday\nweek, and I left for the country on Friday morning at half-past six.\"\n\n\"And what time did you meet Whyte on Thursday night?\" asked Gorby.\n\n\"Let me see,\" said Moreland, crossing his legs and looking thoughtfully\nup to the ceiling, \"it was about half-past nine o'clock. I was in the\nOrient Hotel, in Bourke Street. We had a drink together, and then went\nup the street to an hotel in Russell Street, where we had another. In\nfact,\" said Moreland, coolly, \"we had several other drinks.\"\n\n\"Brutes!\" muttered Mrs. Hableton, below her breath.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Gorby, placidly. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"Well of--it's hardly the thing to confess it,\" said Moreland, looking\nfrom one to the other with a pleasant smile, \"but in a case like this,\nI feel it my duty to throw all social scruples aside. We both became\nvery drunk.\"\n\n\"Ah! Whyte was, as we know, drunk when he got into the cab--and you--?\"\n\n\"I was not quite so bad as Whyte,\" answered the other. \"I had my senses\nabout me. I fancy he left the hotel some minutes before one o'clock on\nFriday morning.\"\n\n\"And what did you do?\"\n\n\"I remained in the hotel. He left his overcoat behind him, and I picked\nit up and followed him shortly afterwards, to return it. I was too\ndrunk to see in which direction he had gone, and stood leaning against\nthe hotel door in Bourke Street with the coat in my hand. Then some one\ncame up, and, snatching the coat from me, made off with it, and the\nlast thing I remember was shouting out: 'Stop, thief!' Then I must have\nfallen down, for next morning I was in bed with all my clothes on, and\nthey were very muddy. I got up and left town for the country by the\nsix-thirty train, so I knew nothing about the matter until I came back\nto Melbourne to-night. That's all I know.\"\n\n\"And you had no impression that Whyte was watched that night?\"\n\n\"No, I had not,\" answered Moreland, frankly. \"He was in pretty good\nspirits, though he was put out at first.\"\n\n\"What was the cause of his being put out?\"\n\nMoreland arose, and going to a side table, brought Whyte's album, which\nhe laid on the table and opened in silence. The contents were very much\nthe same as the photographs in the room, burlesque actresses and ladies\nof the ballet predominating; but Mr. Moreland turned over the pages\ntill nearly the end, when he stopped at a large cabinet photograph, and\npushed the album towards Mr. Gorby.\n\n\"That was the cause,\" he said.\n\nIt was the portrait of a charmingly pretty girl, dressed in white, with\na sailor hat on her fair hair, and holding a lawn-tennis racquet. She\nwas bending half forward, with a winning smile, and in the background\nbloomed a mass of tropical plants. Mrs. Hableton uttered a cry of\nsurprise at seeing this.\n\n\"Why, it's Miss Frettlby,\" she said. \"How did he know her?\"\n\n\"Knew her father--letter of introduction, and all that sort of thing,\"\nsaid Mr. Moreland, glibly.\n\n\"Ah! indeed,\" said Mr. Gorby, slowly. \"So Mr. Whyte knew Mark Frettlby,\nthe millionaire; but how did he obtain a photograph of the daughter?\"\n\n\"She gave it to him,\" said Moreland. \"The fact is, Whyte was very much\nin love with Miss Frettlby.\"\n\n\"And she--\"\n\n\"Was in love with someone else,\" finished Moreland. \"Exactly! Yes, she\nloved a Mr. Brian Fitzgerald, to whom she is now engaged. He was mad on\nher; and Whyte and he used to quarrel desperately over the young lady.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Mr. Gorby. \"And do you know this Mr. Fitzgerald?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, no!\" answered the other, coolly. \"Whyte's friends were not\nmine. He was a rich young man who had good introductions. I am only a\npoor devil on the outskirts of society, trying to push my way in the\nworld.\"\n\n\"You are acquainted with his personal appearance, of course?\" observed\nMr. Gorby.\n\n\"Oh, yes, I can describe that,\" said Moreland. \"In fact, he's not at\nall unlike me, which I take to be rather a compliment, as he is said to\nbe good-looking. He is tall, rather fair, talks in a bored sort of\nmanner, and is altogether what one would call a heavy swell; but you\nmust have seen him,\" he went on, turning to Mrs. Hableton, \"he was here\nthree or four weeks ago, Whyte told me.\"\n\n\"Oh, that was Mr. Fitzgerald, was it?\" said Mrs. Hableton, in surprise.\n\"Yes, he is rather like you; the lady they quarrelled over must have\nbeen Miss Frettlby.\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" said Moreland, rising. \"Well, I'm off; here's my\naddress,\" putting a card in Gorby's, hand. \"I'm glad to be of any use\nto you in this matter, as Whyte was my dearest friend, and I'll do all\nin my power to help you to find out the murderer.\"\n\n\"I don't think that is a very difficult matter,\" said Mr. Gorby, slowly.\n\n\"Oh, you have your suspicions?\" asked Moreland, looking at him.\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"Then who do you think murdered Whyte?\"\n\nMr. Gorby paused a moment, and then said deliberately: \"I have an\nidea--but I am not certain--when I am certain, I'll speak.\"\n\n\"You think Fitzgerald killed my friend,\" said Moreland. \"I see it in\nyour face.\"\n\nMr. Gorby smiled. \"Perhaps,\" he said, ambiguously. \"Wait till I'm\ncertain.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nTHE WOOL KING.\n\n\nThe old Greek legend of Midas turning everything he touched into gold,\nis truer than most people imagine. Mediaeval superstition changed the\nhuman being who possessed such a power into the philosopher's\nstone--the stone which so many alchemists sought in the dark ages. But\nwe of the nineteenth century have given back into human hands this\npower of transformation.\n\nBut we do not ascribe it either to Greek deity, or to superstition; we\ncall it luck. And he who possesses luck should be happy notwithstanding\nthe proverb which hints the contrary. Luck means more than riches--it\nmeans happiness in most of those things, which the fortunate possessor\nof it may choose to touch. Should he speculate, he is successful; if he\nmarry, his wife will surely prove everything to be desired; should he\naspire to a position, social or political, he not only attains it, but\ndoes so with comparative ease. Worldly wealth, domestic happiness, high\nposition, and complete success--all these things belong to the man who\nhas luck.\n\nMark Frettlby was one of these fortunate individuals, and his luck was\nproverbial throughout Australia. If there was any speculation for which\nMark Frettlby went in, other men would surely follow, and in every case\nthe result turned out as well, and in many cases even better than they\nexpected. He had come out in the early days of the colony with\ncomparatively little money, but his great perseverance and\nnever-failing luck had soon changed his hundreds into thousands, and\nnow at the age of fifty-five he did not himself know the extent of his\nincome. He had large stations scattered all over the Colony of\nVictoria, which brought him in a splendid income; a charming country\nhouse, where at certain seasons of the year he dispensed hospitality to\nhis friends; and a magnificent town house down in St. Kilda, which\nwould have been not unworthy of Park Lane.\n\nNor were his domestic relations less happy--he had a charming wife, who\nwas one of the best known and most popular ladies of Melbourne, and an\nequally charming daughter, who, being both pretty and an heiress,\nnaturally attracted crowds of suitors. But Madge Frettlby was\ncapricious, and refused innumerable offers. Being an extremely\nindependent young person, with a mind of her own, she decided to remain\nsingle, as she had not yet seen anyone she could love, and with her\nmother continued to dispense the hospitality of the mansion at St.\nKilda.\n\nBut the fairy prince comes at length to every woman, and in this\ninstance he came at his appointed time, in the person of one Brian\nFitzgerald, a tall, handsome, fair-haired young man hailing from\nIreland.\n\nHe had left behind him in the old country a ruined castle and a few\nacres of barren land, inhabited by discontented tenants, who refused to\npay the rent, and talked darkly about the Land League and other\nagreeable things. Under these circumstances, with no rent coming in,\nand no prospect of doing anything in the future, Brian had left the\ncastle of his forefathers to the rats and the family Banshee, and had\ncome out to Australia to make his fortune.\n\nHe brought letters of introduction to Mark Frettlby, and that\ngentleman, taking a fancy to him, assisted him by every means in his\npower. Under Frettlby's advice Brian bought a station, and, to his\nastonishment, in a few years he found himself growing rich. The\nFitzgeralds had always been more famous for spending than for saving,\nand it was an agreeable surprise to their latest representative to find\nthe money rolling in instead of out. He began to indulge in castles in\nthe air concerning that other castle in Ireland, with the barren acres\nand discontented tenants. In his mind's-eye he saw the old place rise\nup in all its pristine splendour from out its ruins; he saw the barren\nacres well cultivated, and the tenants happy and content--he was rather\ndoubtful on this latter point, but, with the rash confidence of eight\nand twenty, determined to do his best to perform even the impossible.\n\nHaving built and furnished his castle in the air, Brian naturally\nthought of giving it a mistress, and this time actual appearance took\nthe place of vision. He fell in love with Madge Frettlby, and having\ndecided in his own mind that she and none other was fitted to grace the\nvisionary halls of his renovated castle, he watched his opportunity,\nand declared himself. She, woman-like, coquetted with him for some\ntime, but at last, unable to withstand the impetuosity of her Irish\nlover, confessed in a low voice, with a pretty smile on her face, that\nshe could not live without him. Whereupon--well--lovers being of a\nconservative turn of mind, and accustomed to observe the traditional\nforms of wooing, the result can easily be guessed. Brian hunted all\nover the jewellers' shops in Melbourne with lover-like assiduity, and\nhaving obtained a ring wherein were set turquoise stones as blue as his\nown eyes, he placed it on her slender finger, and at last felt that his\nengagement was an accomplished fact.\n\nHe next proceeded to interview the father, and had just screwed up his\ncourage to the awful ordeal, when something occurred which postponed\nthe interview indefinitely. Mrs. Frettlby was out driving, and the\nhorses took fright and bolted. The coachman and groom both escaped\nunhurt, but Mrs. Frettlby was thrown out and killed instantly.\n\nThis was the first really great trouble which had fallen on Mark\nFrettlby, and he seemed stunned by it. Shutting himself up in his room\nhe refused to see anyone, even his daughter, and appeared at the\nfuneral with a white and haggard face, which shocked everyone. When\neverything was over, and the body of the late Mrs. Frettlby was\nconsigned to the earth, with all the pomp and ceremony which money\ncould give, the bereaved husband rode home, and resumed his old life.\nBut he was never the same again. His face, which had always been so\ngenial and so bright, became stern and sad. He seldom smiled, and when\nhe did, it was a faint wintry smile, which seemed mechanical. His whole\ninterest in life was centred in his daughter. She became the sole\nmistress of the St. Kilda mansion, and her father idolised her. She was\napparently the one thing left to him which gave him a pleasure in\nexistence. In truth, had it not been for her bright presence, Mark\nFrettlby would fain have been lying beside his dead wife in the quiet\ngraveyard.\n\nAfter a time Brian again resolved to ask Mr. Frettlby for the hand of\nhis daughter. But for the second time fate interposed. A rival suitor\nmade his appearance, and Brian's hot Irish temper rose in anger at him.\n\nMr. Oliver Whyte had come out from England a few months previously,\nbringing with him a letter of introduction to Mr. Frettlby, who\nreceived him hospitably, as was his custom. Taking advantage of this,\nWhyte lost no time in making himself perfectly at home in the St. Kilda\nmansion.\n\nFrom the outset Brian took a dislike to the new-comer. He was a student\nof Lavater, and prided himself on his perspicuity in reading character.\nHis opinion of Whyte was anything but flattering to that gentleman;\nwhile Madge shared his repulsion towards the new-comer.\n\nOn his part Mr. Whyte was nothing if not diplomatic. He affected not to\nnotice the coldness of Madge's reception of him. On the contrary he\nbegan to pay her the most marked attentions, much to Brian's disgust.\nAt length he asked her to be his wife, and notwithstanding her prompt\nrefusal, spoke to her father on the subject. Much to the astonishment\nof his daughter, Mr. Frettlby not only consented to Whyte paying his\naddresses to Madge, but gave that young lady to understand that he\nwished her to consider his proposals favourably.\n\nIn spite of all Madge could say, he refused to alter his decision, and\nWhyte, feeling himself safe, began to treat Brian with an insolence\nwhich was highly galling to Fitzgerald's proud nature. He had called on\nWhyte at his lodgings, and after a violent quarrel he had left the\nhouse vowing to kill him, should he marry Madge Frettlby.\n\nThe same night Fitzgerald had an interview with Mr. Frettlby. He\nconfessed that he loved Madge, and that his love was returned. So, when\nMadge added her entreaties to Brian's, Mr. Frettlby found himself\nunable to withstand the combined forces, and gave his consent to their\nengagement.\n\nWhyte was absent in the country for the next few days after his stormy\ninterview with Brian, and it was only on his return that he learnt that\nMadge was engaged to his rival. He saw Mr. Frettlby, and having learnt\nfrom his own lips that such was the case, he left the house at once,\nand swore that he would never enter it again. He little knew how\nprophetic were his words, for on that same night he met his death in\nthe hansom cab. He had passed out of the life of both the lovers, and\nthey, glad that he troubled them no more, never suspected for a moment\nthat the body of the unknown man found in Royston's cab was that of\nOliver Whyte.\n\nAbout two weeks after Whyte's disappearance Mr. Frettlby gave a dinner\nparty in honour of his daughter's birthday. It was a delightful\nevening, and the wide French windows which led on to the verandah were\nopen, letting in a gentle breeze from the ocean. Outside there was a\nkind of screen of tropical plants, and through the tangle of the boughs\nthe guests, seated at the table, could just see the waters of the bay\nglittering in the pale moonlight. Brian was seated opposite to Madge,\nand every now and then he caught a glimpse of her bright face from\nbehind the fruit and flowers, which stood in the centre of the table.\nMark Frettlby was at the head of the table, and appeared in very good\nspirits. His stern features were somewhat relaxed, and he drank more\nwine than usual.\n\nThe soup had just been removed when some one, who was late, entered\nwith apologies and took his seat. Some one in this case was Mr. Felix\nRolleston, one of the best known young men in Melbourne. He had an\nincome of his own, scribbled a little for the papers, was to be seen at\nevery house of any pretensions in Melbourne, and was always bright,\nhappy, and full of news. For details of any scandal you were safe in\napplying to Felix Rolleston. He knew all that was going on, both at\nhome and abroad. And his knowledge, if not very accurate, was at least\nextensive, while his conversation was piquant, and at times witty.\nCalton, one of the leading lawyers of the city, remarked that\n\"Rolleston put him in mind of what Beaconsfield said of one of the\npersonages in Lothair, 'He wasn't an intellectual Croesus, but his\npockets were always full of sixpences.'\" Be it said in his favour that\nFelix was free with his sixpences.\n\nThe conversation, which had shown signs of languishing before his\narrival, now brightened up.\n\n\"So awfully sorry, don't you know,\" said Felix, as he slipped into a\nseat by Madge; \"but a fellow like me has got to be careful of his\ntime--so many calls on it.\"\n\n\"So many calls in it, you mean,\" retorted Madge, with a disbelieving\nsmile. \"Confess, now, you have been paying a round of visits.\"\n\n\"Well, yes,\" assented Mr. Rolleston; \"that's the disadvantage of having\na large circle of acquaintances. They give you weak tea and thin bread\nand butter, whereas--\"\n\n\"You would rather have something else,\" finished Brian.\n\nThere was a laugh at this, but Mr. Rolleston disdained to notice the\ninterruption.\n\n\"The only advantage of five o'clock tea,\" he went on, \"is, that it\nbrings people together, and one hears what's going on.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, Rolleston,\" said Mr. Frettlby, who was looking at him with an\namused smile. \"What news have you?\"\n\n\"Good news, bad news, and such news as you have never heard of,\" quoted\nRolleston gravely. \"Yes, I have a bit of news--haven't you heard it?\"\n\nRolleston felt he held sensation in his hands. There was nothing he\nliked better.\n\n\"Well, do you know,\" he said, gravely fixing in his eye-glass, \"they\nhave found out the name of the fellow who was murdered in the hansom\ncab.\"\n\n\"Never!\" cried every one eagerly.\n\n\"Yes,\" went on Rolleston, \"and what's more, you all know him.\"\n\n\"It's never Whyte?\" said Brian, in a horrified tone.\n\n\"Hang it, how did you know?\" said Rolleston, rather annoyed at being\nforestalled. \"Why, I just heard it at the St. Kilda station.\"\n\n\"Oh, easily enough,\" said Brian, rather confused. \"I used to meet Whyte\nconstantly, and as I have not seen him for the last two weeks, I\nthought he might be the victim.\"\n\n\"How did they find out?\" asked Mr. Frettlby, idly toying with his\nwine-glass.\n\n\"Oh, one of those detective fellows, you know,\" answered Felix. \"They\nknow everything.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry to hear it,\" said Frettlby, referring to the fact that Whyte\nwas murdered. \"He had a letter of introduction to me, and seemed a\nclever, pushing young fellow.\"\n\n\"A confounded cad,\" muttered Felix, under his breath; and Brian, who\noverheard him, seemed inclined to assent. For the rest of the meal\nnothing was talked about but the murder, and the mystery in which it\nwas shrouded. When the ladies retired they chatted about it in the\ndrawingroom, but finally dropped it for more agreeable subjects. The\nmen, however, when the cloth was removed, filled their glasses, and\ncontinued the discussion with unabated vigour. Brian alone did not take\npart in the conversation. He sat moodily staring at his untasted wine,\nwrapped in a brown study.\n\n\"What I can't make out,\" observed Rolleston, who was amusing himself\nwith cracking nuts, \"is why they did not find out who he was before.\"\n\n\"That is not hard to answer,\" said Frettlby, filling his--glass. \"He\nwas comparatively little known here, as he had been out from England\nsuch a short time, and I fancy that this was the only house at which he\nvisited.\"\n\n\"And look here, Rolleston,\" said Calton, who was sitting near him, \"if\nyou were to find a man dead in a hansom cab, dressed in evening\nclothes--which nine men out of ten are in the habit of wearing in the\nevening--no cards in his pockets, and no name on his linen, I rather\nthink you would find it hard to discover who he was. I consider it\nreflects great credit on the police for finding out so quickly.\"\n\n\"Puts one in mind of 'The Leavenworth Case,' and all that sort of\nthing,\" said Felix, whose reading was of the lightest description.\n\"Awfully exciting, like putting a Chinese puzzle together. Gad, I\nwouldn't mind being a detective myself.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid if that were the case,\" said Mr. Frettlby, with an amused\nsmile, \"criminals would be pretty safe.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know so much about that,\" answered Felix, shrewdly; \"some\nfellows are like trifle at a party, froth on top, but something better\nunderneath.\"\n\n\"What a greedy simile,\" said Calton, sipping his wine; \"but I'm afraid\nthe police will have a more difficult task in discovering the man who\ncommitted the crime. In my opinion he's a deuced clever fellow.\"\n\n\"Then you don't think he will be discovered?\" asked Brian, rousing\nhimself out of his brown study.\n\n\"Well, I don't go as far as that,\" rejoined Calton; \"but he has\ncertainly left no trace behind him, and even the Red Indian, in whom\ninstinct for tracking is so highly developed, needs some sort of a\ntrail to enable him to find out his enemies. Depend upon it,\" went on\nCalton, warming to his subject, \"the man who murdered Whyte is no\nordinary criminal; the place he chose for the committal of the crime\nwas such a safe one.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said Rolleston. \"Why, I should think that a hansom\ncab in a public street would be very unsafe.\"\n\n\"It is that very fact that makes it safer,\" replied Mr. Calton,\nepigrammatically. \"You read De Quincey's account of the Marr murders in\nLondon, and you will see that the more public the place the less risk\nthere is of detection. There was nothing about the gentleman in the\nlight coat who murdered Whyte to excite Royston's suspicions. He\nentered the cab with Whyte; no noise or anything likely to attract\nattention was heard, and then he alighted. Naturally enough, Royston\ndrove to St. Kilda, and never suspected Whyte was dead till he looked\ninside and touched him. As to the man in the light coat, he doesn't\nlive in Powlett Street--no--nor in East Melbourne either.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Frettlby.\n\n\"Because he wouldn't have been such a fool as to leave a trail to his\nown door; he did what the fox often does--he doubled. My opinion is\nthat he went either right through East Melbourne to Fitzroy, or he\nwalked back through the Fitzroy Gardens into town. There was no one\nabout at that time of the morning, and he could return to his lodgings,\nhotel, or wherever he is staying, with impunity. Of course, this is a\ntheory that may be wrong; but from what insight into human nature my\nprofession has given me, I think that my idea is a correct one.\"\n\nAll present agreed with Mr. Calton's idea, as it really did seem the\nmost natural thing that would be done by a man desirous of escaping\ndetection.\n\n\"Tell you what,\" said Felix to Brian, as they were on their way to the\ndrawing-room, \"if the fellow that committed the crime, is found out, by\ngad, he ought to get Calton to defend him.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nBRIAN TAKES A WALK AND A DRIVE.\n\n\nWhen the gentlemen entered the drawing-room a young lady was engaged in\nplaying one of those detestable pieces of the MORCEAU DE SALON order,\nin which an unoffending air is taken, and variations embroidered on it,\ntill it becomes a perfect agony to distinguish the tune, amid the\nperpetual rattle of quavers and demi-semi-quavers. The melody in this\ncase was \"Over the Garden Wall,\" with variations by Signor Thumpanini,\nand the young lady who played it was a pupil of that celebrated Italian\nmusician. When the male portion of the guests entered, the air was\nbeing played in the bass with a great deal of power (that is, the loud\npedal was down), and with a perpetual rattle of treble notes, trying\nwith all their shrill might to drown the tune.\n\n\"Gad! it's getting over the garden wall in a hailstorm,\" said Felix, as\nhe strolled over to the piano, for he saw that the musician was Dora\nFeatherweight, an heiress to whom he was then paying attention, in the\nhope that she might be induced to take the name of Rolleston. So, when\nthe fair Dora had paralysed her audience with one final bang and\nrattle, as if the gentleman going over the garden wall had tumbled into\nthe cucumber-frame, Felix was loud in his expressions of delight.\n\n\"Such power, you know, Miss Featherweight,\" he said, sinking into a\nchair, and mentally wondering if any of the piano strings had given way\nat that last crash. \"You put your heart into it--and all your muscle,\ntoo, by gad,\" he added mentally.\n\n\"It's nothing but practice,\" answered Miss Featherweight, with a modest\nblush. \"I am at the piano four hours every day.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" thought Felix, \"what a time the family must have of\nit.\" But he kept this remark to himself, and, screwing his eye-glass\ninto his left organ of vision, merely ejaculated, \"Lucky piano.\"\n\nMiss Featherweight, not being able to think of any answer to this,\nlooked down and blushed, while the ingenuous Felix looked up and sighed.\n\nMadge and Brian were in a corner of the room talking over Whyte's death.\n\n\"I never liked him,\" she said, \"but it is horrible to think of him\ndying like that.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" answered Brian, gloomily; \"from all I can hear dying by\nchloroform is a very easy death.\"\n\n\"Death can never be easy,\" replied Madge, \"especially to a young man so\nfull of health and spirits as Mr. Whyte was.\"\n\n\"I believe you are sorry he's dead,\" said Brian, jealously.\n\n\"Aren't you?\" she asked in some surprise.\n\n\"De mortuis nil nisi bonum,\" quoted Fitzgerald. \"But as I detested him\nwhen alive, you can't expect me to regret his end.\"\n\nMadge did not answer him, but glanced quickly at his face, and for the\nfirst time it struck her that he looked ill.\n\n\"What is the matter with you, dear?\" she asked, placing her hand on his\narm. \"You are not looking well.\"\n\n\"Nothing--nothing,\" he answered hurriedly. \"I've been a little worried\nabout business lately--but come,\" he said, rising, \"let us go outside,\nfor I see your father has got that girl with the steam-whistle voice to\nsing.\"\n\nThe girl with the steam-whistle voice was Julia Featherweight, the\nsister of Rolleston's inamorata, and Madge stifled a laugh as she went\non to the verandah with Fitzgerald.\n\n\"What a shame of you,\" she said, bursting into a laugh when they were\nsafely outside; \"she's been taught by the best masters.\"\n\n\"How I pity them,\" retorted Brian, grimly, as Julia wailed out, \"Meet\nme once again,\" with an ear-piercing shrillness.\n\n\"I'd much rather listen to our ancestral Banshee, and as to meeting her\nagain, one interview would be more than enough.\" Madge did not answer,\nbut leaning lightly over the high rail of the verandah looked out into\nthe beautiful moonlit night. There were a number of people passing\nalong the Esplanade, some of whom stopped and listened to Julia's\nshrill notes. One man in particular seemed to have a taste for music,\nfor he persistently stared over the fence at the house. Brian and Madge\ntalked of divers subjects, but every time Madge looked up she saw the\nman watching the house.\n\n\"What does that man want, Brian?\" she asked.\n\n\"What man?\" asked Brian, starting. \"Oh,\" he went on indifferently, as\nthe watcher moved away from the gate and crossed the road on to the\nfootpath, \"he's taken up with the music, I suppose; that's all.\"\n\nMadge said nothing, but she could not help thinking there was more in\nit than the music. Presently Julia ceased, and she proposed to go in.\n\n\"Why?\" asked Brian, who was lying back in a comfortable seat, smoking a\ncigarette. \"It's nice enough here.\"\n\n\"I must attend to my guests,\" she answered, rising. \"You stop here and\nfinish your cigarette,\" and with a gay laugh she flitted into the house.\n\nBrian sat and smoked, staring out into the moonlight the while. Yes,\nthe man was certainly watching the house, for he sat on one of the\nseats, and kept his eyes fixed on the brilliantly-lighted windows.\nBrian threw away his cigarette and shivered slightly.\n\n\"Could anyone have seen me?\" he muttered, rising uneasily.\n\n\"Pshaw! of course not; and the cabman would never recognise me again.\nCurse Whyte, I wish I'd never set eyes upon him.\"\n\nHe gave one glance at the dark figure on the seat, and then, with a\nshiver, passed into the warm, well-lighted room. He did not feel easy\nin his mind, and he would have felt still less so had he known that the\nman on the seat was one of the cleverest of the Melbourne detectives.\n\nMr. Gorby had been watching the Frettlby mansion the whole evening, and\nwas getting rather annoyed. Moreland did not know where Fitzgerald\nlived, and as that was one of the primary facts the detective wished to\nascertain, he determined to watch Brian's movements, and to trace him\nhome.\n\n\"If he's the lover of that pretty girl, I'll wait till he leaves the\nhouse,\" argued Mr. Gorby to himself, as he took his seat on the\nEsplanade. \"He won't long remain away from her, and once he leaves the\nhouse it will be no difficult matter to find out where he lives.\"\n\nWhen Brian made his appearance early in the evening, on his way to Mark\nFrettlby's mansion, he wore evening dress, a light overcoat, and a soft\nhat.\n\n\"Well, I'm dashed!\" ejaculated Mr. Gorby, when he saw Fitzgerald\ndisappear; \"if he isn't a fool I don't know who is, to go about in the\nvery clothes he wore when he polished Whyte off, and think he won't be\nrecognised. Melbourne ain't Paris or London, that he can afford to be\nso careless, and when I put the darbies on him he will be astonished.\nAh, well,\" he went on, lighting his pipe and taking a seat on the\nEsplanade, \"I suppose I'll have to wait here till he comes out.\"\n\nMr. Gorby's patience was pretty severely tried, for hour after hour\npassed, and no one appeared. He smoked several pipes, and watched the\npeople strolling along in the soft silver moonlight. A bevy of girls\npassed by with their arms round one another's waists. Then a young man\nand woman, evidently lovers, came walking along. They sat down by Mr.\nGorby and looked hard at him, to hint that he need not stay. But the\ndetective took no heed of them, and kept his eyes steadily upon the\ngreat house opposite. Finally, the lovers took themselves off with a\nvery bad grace.\n\nThen Mr. Gorby saw Madge and Brian come out on to the verandah, and\nheard in the stillness of the night, a sound weird and unearthly. It\nwas Miss Featherweight singing. He saw Madge go in, shortly followed by\nBrian. The latter turned and stared at him for a moment.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Gorby to himself as he re-lit his pipe; \"your conscience is\na-smiting you, is it? Wait a bit, my boy, till I have you in gaol.\"\n\nThen the guests came out of the house, and their black figures\ndisappeared one by one from the moonlight as they shook hands and said\ngood-night.\n\nShortly after Brian came down the path with Frettlby at his side, and\nMadge hanging on her father's arm. Frettlby opened the gate and held\nout his hand.\n\n\"Good-night, Fitzgerald,\" he said, in a hearty voice; \"come soon again.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Brian, dearest,\" said Madge, kissing him, \"and don't\nforget to-morrow.\"\n\nThen father and daughter closed the gate, leaving Brian outside, and\nwalked back to the house.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Gorby to himself, \"if you only knew what I know, you\nwouldn't be so precious kind to him.\"\n\nBrian strolled along the Esplanade, and crossing over, passed by Gorby\nand walked on till he was opposite the Esplanade Hotel. Then he leaned\nhis arms on the fence, and, taking off his hat, enjoyed the calm beauty\nof the hour.\n\n\"What a good-looking fellow,\" murmured Mr. Gorby, in a regretful tone.\n\"I can hardly believe it of him, but the proofs are too clear.\"\n\nThe night was perfectly still. Not a breath of wind stirred, for what\nbreeze there had been had long since died away. But Brian could see the\nwhite wavelets breaking lightly on the sands. The long narrow pier ran\nout like a black thread into the sheet of gleaming silver, and away in\nthe distance the line of the Williamstown lights sparkled like some\nfairy illumination.\n\nOver all this placid scene of land and water was a sky such as Dore\nloved--a great heavy mass of rain-clouds heaped one on top of the\nother, as the rocks the Titans piled to reach Olympus. Then a break in\nthe woof, and a bit of dark blue sky could be seen glittering with\nstars, in the midst of which sailed the serene moon, shedding down her\nlight on the cloudland beneath, giving to it all, one silver lining.\n\nSomewhat to the annoyance of Mr. Gorby, who had no eye for the\npicturesque, Brian gazed at the sky for several minutes, admiring the\nwonderful beauty of its broken masses of light and shade. At length he\nlit a cigarette and walked down the steps on to the pier.\n\n\"Oh, suicide, is it?\" muttered Mr. Gorby. \"Not if I can help it.\" And\nhe lit his pipe and followed him.\n\nHe found Brian leaning over the parapet at the end of the pier, looking\nat the glittering waters beneath, which kept rising and falling in a\ndreamy rhythm, that soothed and charmed the ear. \"Poor girl! poor\ngirl!\" the detective heard him mutter as he came up. \"If she only knew\nall! If she--\"\n\nAt this moment he heard the approaching step, and turned round sharply.\nThe detective saw that his face was ghastly pale in the moonlight, and\nhis brows wrinkled in anger.\n\n\"What the devil do you want?\" he burst out, as Gorby paused.\n\n\"What do you mean by following me all over the place?\"\n\n\"Saw me, watching the house,\" said Gorby to himself. \"I'm not following\nyou, sir,\" he said aloud. \"I suppose the pier ain't private property. I\nonly came down here for a breath of fresh air.\"\n\nFitzgerald did not answer, but turned sharply on his heel, and walked\nquickly up the pier, leaving Gorby staring after him.\n\n\"He's getting frightened,\" soliloquised the detective to himself, as he\nstrolled easily along, keeping the black figure in front well in view.\n\"I'll have to keep a sharp eye on him or he'll be clearing out of\nVictoria.\"\n\nBrian walked rapidly up to the St. Kilda station, for on looking at his\nwatch he found that he would just have time to catch the last train. He\narrived a few minutes before it started, so, getting into the smoking\ncarriage at the near end of the platform, he lit a cigarette, and,\nleaning back in his seat, watched the late comers hurrying into the\nstation. Just as the last bell rang he saw a man rush along, to catch\nthe train. It was the same man who had been watching him the whole\nevening, and Brian felt confident that he was being followed. He\ncomforted himself, however, with the thought that this pertinacious\nfollower might lose the train, and, being in the last carriage himself,\nhe kept a look out along the platform, expecting to see his friend of\nthe Esplanade standing disappointed on it. There was no appearance of\nhim, so Brian, sinking back into his seat, lamented his ill-luck in not\nshaking off this man who kept him under such strict surveillance.\n\n\"Confound him!\" he muttered softly. \"I expect he will follow me to East\nMelbourne, and find out where I live, but he shan't if I can help it.\"\n\nThere was no one but himself in the carriage, and he felt relieved at\nthis because he was in no humour to hear chatter.\n\n\"Murdered in a cab,\" he said, lighting a fresh cigarette, and blowing a\ncloud of smoke. \"A romance in real life, which beats Miss Braddon\nhollow. There is one thing certain, he won't come between Madge and me\nagain. Poor Madge!\" with an impatient sigh. \"If she only knew all,\nthere would not be much chance of our marriage; but she can never find\nout, and I don't suppose anyone else will.\"\n\nHere a thought suddenly struck him, and rising out of his seat, he\nwalked to the other end of the carriage, and threw himself on the\ncushions, as if desirous to escape from himself.\n\n\"What grounds can that man have for suspecting me?\" he said aloud. \"No\none knows I was with Whyte on that night, and the police can't possibly\nbring forward any evidence to show that I was. Pshaw!\" he went on,\nimpatiently buttoning up his coat. \"I am like a child, afraid of my\nshadow--the fellow on the pier is only some one out for a breath of\nfresh air, as he said himself--I am quite safe.\"\n\nAt the same time, he felt by no means easy in his mind, and as he\nstepped out on to the platform at the Melbourne station he looked round\napprehensively, as if he half expected to feel the detective's hand\nupon his shoulder. But he saw no one at all like the man he had met on\nthe St. Kilda pier, and with a sigh of relief he left the station. Mr.\nGorby, however, was not far away. He was following at a safe distance.\nBrian walked slowly along Flinders Street apparently deep in thought.\nHe turned up Russell Street and did not stop until he found himself\nclose to the Burke and Wills' monument--the exact spot where the cab\nhad stopped on the night of Whyte's murder.\n\n\"Ah!\" said the detective to himself, as he stood in the shadow on the\nopposite side of the street. \"You're going to have a look at it, are\nyou?--I wouldn't, if I were you--it's dangerous.\"\n\nFitzgerald stood for a few minutes at the corner, and then walked up\nCollins Street. When he got to the cab-stand, opposite the Melbourne\nClub, still suspecting he was followed, he hailed a hansom, and drove\naway in the direction of Spring Street. Gorby was rather perplexed at\nthis sudden move, but without delay, he hailed another cab, and told\nthe driver to follow the first till it stopped.\n\n\"Two can play at that game,\" he said, settling himself back in the cab,\n\"and I'll get the better of you, clever as you are--and you are\nclever,\" he went on in a tone of admiration, as he looked round the\nluxurious hansom, \"to choose such a convenient place for a murder; no\ndisturbance and plenty of time for escape after you had finished; it's\na pleasure going after a chap like you, instead of after men who tumble\ndown like ripe fruit, and ain't got any brains to keep their crime\nquiet.\"\n\nWhile the detective thus soliloquised, his cab, following on the trail\nof the other, had turned down Spring Street, and was being driven\nrapidly along the Wellington Parade, in the direction of East\nMelbourne. It then turned up Powlett Street, at which Mr. Gorby was\nglad.\n\n\"Ain't so clever as I thought,\" he said to himself. \"Shows his nest\nright off, without any attempt to hide it.\"\n\nThe detective, however, had reckoned without his host, for the cab in\nfront kept driving on, through an interminable maze of streets, until\nit seemed as though Brian were determined to drive the whole night.\n\n\"Look 'ere, sir!\" cried Gorby's cabman, looking through his trap-door\nin the roof of the hansom, \"'ow long's this 'ere game agoin' to larst?\nMy 'oss is knocked up, 'e is, and 'is blessed old legs is agivin' way\nunder 'im!\"\n\n\"Go on! go on!\" answered the detective, impatiently; \"I'll pay you\nwell.\"\n\nThe cabman's spirits were raised by this, and by dint of coaxing and a\nliberal use of the whip, he managed to get his jaded horse up to a\npretty good pace. They were in Fitzroy by this time, and both cabs\nturned out of Gertrude Street into Nicholson Street; thence passed on\nto Evelyn Street and along Spring Street, until Brian's cab stopped at\nthe corner of Collins Street, and Gorby saw him alight and dismiss his\ncab-man. He then walked down the street and disappeared into the\nTreasury Gardens.\n\n\"Confound it,\" said the detective, as he got out and paid his fare,\nwhich was by no means a light one, but over which he had no time to\nargue, \"we've come in a circle, and I do believe he lives in Powlett\nStreet after all.\"\n\nHe went into the gardens, and saw Brian some distance ahead of him,\nwalking rapidly. It was bright moonlight, and he could easily\ndistinguish Fitzgerald by his light coat.\n\nAs he went along that noble avenue with its elms in their winter dress,\nthe moon shining through their branches wrought a fantastic tracery, on\nthe smooth asphalte. And on either side Gorby could see the dim white\nforms of the old Greek gods and goddesses--Venus Victrix, with the\napple in her hand (which Mr. Gorby, in his happy ignorance of heathen\nmythology, took for Eve offering Adam the forbidden fruit); Diana, with\nthe hound at her feet, and Bacchus and Ariadne (which the detective\nimagined were the Babes in the Wood). He knew that each of the statues\nhad queer names, but thought they were merely allegorical. Passing over\nthe bridge, with the water rippling quietly underneath, Brian went up\nthe smooth yellow path to where the statue of Hebe, holding the cup,\nseems instinct with life; and turning down the path to the right, he\nleft the gardens by the end gate, near which stands the statue of the\nDancing Faun, with the great bush of scarlet geranium burning like an\naltar before it. Then he went along the Wellington Parade, and turned\nup Powlett Street, where he stopped at a house near Cairns' Memorial\nChurch, much to Mr. Gorby's relief, who, being like Hamlet, \"fat and\nscant of breath,\" found himself rather exhausted. He kept well in the\nshadow, however, and saw Fitzgerald give one final look round before he\ndisappeared into the house. Then Mr. Gorby, like the Robber Captain in\nAli Baba, took careful stock of the house, and fixed its locality and\nappearance well in his mind, as he intended to call at it on the morrow.\n\n\"What I'm going to do,\" he said, as he walked slowly back to Melbourne,\n\"is to see his landlady when he's out, and find out what time he came\nin on the night of the murder. If it fits into the time he got out of\nRankin's cab, I'll get out a warrant, and arrest him straight off.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nMR. GORBY IS SATISFIED AT LAST.\n\n\nIn spite of his long walk, and still longer drive, Brian did not sleep\nwell that night. He kept tossing and turning, or lying on his back,\nwide awake, looking into the darkness and thinking of Whyte. Towards\ndawn, when the first faint glimmer of morning came through the venetian\nblinds, he fell into a sort of uneasy doze, haunted by horrible dreams.\nHe thought he was driving in a hansom, when suddenly he found Whyte by\nhis side, clad in white cerements, grinning and gibbering at him with\nghastly merriment. Then the cab went over a precipice, and he fell from\na great height, down, down, with the mocking laughter still sounding in\nhis ears, until he woke with a loud cry, and found it was broad\ndaylight, and that drops of perspiration were standing on his brow. It\nwas no use trying to sleep any longer, so, with a weary sigh, he arose\nand went to his tub, feeling jaded and worn out by worry and want of\nsleep. His bath did him some good. The cold water brightened him up and\npulled him together. Still he could not help giving a start of surprise\nwhen he saw his face reflected in the mirror, old and haggard-looking,\nwith dark circles round the eyes.\n\n\"A pleasant life I'll have of it if this sort of thing goes on,\" he\nsaid, bitterly, \"I wish I had never seen, or heard of Whyte.\"\n\nHe dressed himself carefully. He was not a man to neglect his toilet,\nhowever worried and out of sorts he might happen to feel. Yet,\nnotwithstanding all his efforts the change in his appearance did not\nescape the eye of his landlady. She was a small, dried-up little woman,\nwith a wrinkled yellowish face. She seemed parched up and brittle.\nWhenever she moved she crackled, and one went in constant dread of\nseeing a wizen-looking limb break off short like the branch of some\ndead tree. When she spoke it was in a voice hard and shrill, not unlike\nthe chirp of a cricket. When--as was frequently the case--she clothed\nher attenuated form in a faded brown silk gown, her resemblance to that\nlively insect was remarkable.\n\nAnd, as on this morning she crackled into Brian's sitting-room with the\nARGUS and his coffee, a look of dismay at his altered appearance, came\nover her stony little countenance.\n\n\"Dear me, sir,\" she chirped out in her shrill voice, as she placed her\nburden on the table, \"are you took bad?\"\n\nBrian shook his head.\n\n\"Want of sleep, that's all, Mrs. Sampson,\" he answered, unfolding the\nARGUS.\n\n\"Ah! that's because ye ain't got enough blood in yer 'ead,\" said Mrs.\nSampson, wisely, for she had her own ideas on the subject of health.\n\"If you ain't got blood you ain't got sleep.\"\n\nBrian looked at her as she said this, for there seemed such an obvious\nwant of blood in her veins that he wondered if she had ever slept in\nall her life.\n\n\"There was my father's brother, which, of course, makes 'im my uncle,\"\nwent on the landlady, pouring out a cup of coffee for Brian, \"an' the\nblood 'e 'ad was somethin' astoundin', which it made 'im sleep that\nlong as they 'ad to draw pints from 'im afore 'e'd wake in the mornin'.\"\n\nBrian had the ARGUS before his face, and under its friendly cover he\nlaughed quietly to himself.\n\n\"His blood poured out like a river,\" went on the landlady, still\ndrawing from the rich stores of her imagination, \"and the doctor was\nstruck dumb with astonishment at seein' the Nigagerer which burst from\n'im--but I'm not so full-blooded myself.\"\n\nFitzgerald again stifled a laugh, and wondered that Mrs. Sampson was\nnot afraid of being treated as were Ananias and Sapphira. However, he\nsaid nothing, but merely intimated that if she would leave the room he\nwould take his breakfast.\n\n\"An' if you wants anythin' else, Mr. Fitzgerald,\" she said, going to\nthe door, \"you knows your way to the bell as easily as I do to the\nkitching,\" and, with a final chirrup, she crackled out of the room.\n\nAs soon as the door was closed, Brian put down his paper and roared, in\nspite of his worries. He had that extraordinary vivacious Irish\ntemperament, which enables a man to put all trouble behind his back,\nand thoroughly enjoy the present. His landlady, with her Arabian\nNightlike romances, was a source of great amusement to him, and he felt\nconsiderably cheered by the odd turn her humour had taken this morning.\nAfter a time, however, his laughter ceased, and his troubles came\ncrowding on him again. He drank his coffee, but pushed away the food\nwhich was before him; and looked through the ARGUS, for the latest\nreport about the murder case. What he read made his cheek turn a shade\npaler than before. He could feel his heart thumping wildly.\n\n\"They've found a clue, have they?\" he muttered, rising and pacing\nrestlessly up and down. \"I wonder what it can be? I threw that man off\nthe scent last night, but if he suspects me, there will be no\ndifficulty in his finding out where I live. Bah! What nonsense I am\ntalking. I am the victim of my own morbid imagination. There is nothing\nto connect me with the crime, so I need not be afraid of my shadow.\nI've a good mind to leave town for a time, but if I am suspected that\nwould excite suspicion. Oh, Madge! my darling,\" he cried passionately,\n\"if you only knew what I suffer, I know that you would pity me--but you\nmust never know the truth--Never! Never!\" and sinking into a chair by\nthe window, he covered his face with his hands. After remaining in this\nposition for some minutes, occupied with his own gloomy thoughts, he\narose and rang the bell. A faint crackle in the distance announced that\nMrs. Sampson had heard it, and she soon came into the room, looking\nmore like a cricket than ever. Brian had gone into his bedroom, and\ncalled out to her from there--\n\n\"I am going down to St. Kilda, Mrs. Sampson,\" he said, \"and probably I\nshall not be back all day.\"\n\n\"Which I 'opes it 'ull do you good,\" she answered, \"for you've eaten\nnothin', an' the sea breezes is miraculous for makin' you take to your\nvictuals. My mother's brother, bein' a sailor, an' wonderful for 'is\nstomach, which, when 'e 'ad done a meal, the table looked as if a\nlow-cuss had gone over it.\"\n\n\"A what?\" asked Fitzgerald, buttoning his gloves.\n\n\"A low-cuss!\" replied the landlady, in surprise at his ignorance, \"as\nI've read in 'Oly Writ, as 'ow John the Baptist was partial to 'em, not\nthat I think they'd be very fillin', tho', to be sure, 'e 'ad a sweet\ntooth, and ate 'oney with 'em.\"\n\n\"Oh! you mean locusts,\" said Brian now enlightened.\n\n\"An' what else?\" asked Mrs. Sampson, indignantly; \"which, tho' not\nbein' a scholar'd, I speaks English, I 'opes, my mother's second cousin\n'avin' 'ad first prize at a spellin' bee, tho' 'e died early through\nbrain fever, 'avin' crowded 'is 'ead over much with the dictionary.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" answered Brian, mechanically. \"How unfortunate!\" He was not\nlistening to Mrs. Sampson's remarks. He suddenly remembered an\narrangement which Madge had made, and which up till now had slipped his\nmemory.\n\n\"Mrs. Sampson,\" he said, turning round at the door, \"I am going to\nbring Mr. Frettlby and his daughter to have a cup of afternoon tea\nhere, so you might have some ready.\"\n\n\"You 'ave only to ask and to 'ave,\" answered Mrs. Sampson, hospitably,\nwith a gratified crackle of all her joints. \"I'll make the tea, sir,\nan' also some of my own perticler cakes, bein' a special kind I 'ave,\nwhich my mother showed me 'ow to make, 'avin' been taught by a lady as\nshe nussed thro' the scarlet fever, tho' bein' of a weak constitootion,\nshe died soon arter, bein' in the 'abit of contractin' any disease she\nmight chance on.\"\n\nBrian hurried off lest in her Poe-like appreciation of them, Mrs.\nSampson should give vent to more charnel-house horrors.\n\nAt one period of her life, the little woman had been a nurse, and it\nwas told of her that she had frightened one of her patients into\nconvulsions during the night by narrating to her the history of all the\ncorpses she had laid out. This ghoul-like tendency in the end proved\nfatal to her professional advancement.\n\nAs soon as Fitzgerald had gone, she went over to the window and watched\nhim as he walked slowly down the street--a tall, handsome man, of whom\nany woman would be proud.\n\n\"What an awful thing it are to think 'e'll be a corpse some day,\" she\nchirped cheerily to herself, \"tho' of course bein' a great swell in 'is\nown place, 'e'll 'ave a nice airy vault, which 'ud be far more\ncomfortable than a close, stuffy grave, even tho' it 'as a tombstone\nan' vi'lets over it. Ah, now! Who are you, impertinence?\" she broke\noff, as a stout man in a light suit of clothes crossed the road and\nrang the bell, \"a-pullin' at the bell as if it were a pump 'andle.\"\n\nAs the gentleman at the door, who was none other than Mr. Gorby, did\nnot hear her, he of course did not reply, so she hurried down the\nstairs, crackling with anger at the rough usage her bell had received.\n\nMr. Gorby had seen Brian go out, and deeming it a good opportunity for\nenquiry had lost no time in making a start.\n\n\"You nearly tored the bell down,\" said Mrs. Sampson, as she presented\nher thin body and wrinkled face to the view of the detective.\n\n\"I'm very sorry,\" answered Gorby, meekly. \"I'll knock next time.\"\n\n\"Oh, no you won't,\" said the landlady, tossing her head, \"me not 'avin'\na knocker, an' your 'and a-scratchin' the paint off the door, which it\nain't been done over six months by my sister-in-law's cousin, which 'e\nis a painter, with a shop in Fitzroy, an' a wonderful heye to colour.\"\n\n\"Does Mr. Fitzgerald live here?\" asked Mr. Gorby, quietly.\n\n\"He do,\" replied Mrs. Sampson, \"but 'e's gone out, an' won't be back\ntill the arternoon, which any messige 'ull be delivered to 'im punctual\non 'is arrival.\"\n\n\"I'm glad he's not in,\" said Mr. Gorby. \"Would you allow me to have a\nfew moments' conversation?\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked the landlady, her curiosity being roused.\n\n\"I'll tell you when we get inside,\" answered Mr. Gorby.\n\nShe looked at him with her sharp little eyes, and seeing nothing\ndisreputable about him, led the way upstairs, crackling loudly the\nwhole time. This so astonished Mr. Gorby that he cast about in his own\nmind for an explanation of the phenomenon.\n\n\"Wants oiling about the jints,\" was his conclusion, \"but I never heard\nanything like it, and she looks as if she'd snap in two, she's that\nbrittle.\"\n\nMrs. Sampson took Gorby into Brian's sitting-room, and having closed\nthe door, sat down and prepared to hear what he had to say for himself.\n\n\"I 'ope it ain't bills,\" she said. \"Mr. Fitzgerald 'avin' money in the\nbank, and everythin' respectable like a gentleman as 'e is, tho', to be\nsure, your bill might come down on him unbeknown, 'e not 'avin' kept it\nin mind, which it ain't everybody as 'ave sich a good memory as my aunt\non my mother's side, she 'avin' been famous for 'er dates like a\n'istory, not to speak of 'er multiplication tables, and the numbers of\npeople's 'ouses.\"\n\n\"It's not bills,\" answered Mr. Gorby, who, having vainly attempted to\nstem the shrill torrent of words, had given in, and waited mildly until\nshe had finished; \"I only want to know a few things about Mr.\nFitzgerald's habits.\"\n\n\"And what for?\" asked Mrs. Sampson, indignantly. \"Are you a noospaper\na-putin' in articles about people who don't want to see 'emselves in\nprint, which I knows your 'abits, my late 'usband 'avin' bin a printer\non a paper which bust up, not 'avin' the money to pay wages, thro'\nwhich, there was doo to him the sum of one pound seven and sixpence\nhalfpenny, which I, bein' 'is widder, ought to 'ave, not that I expects\nto see it on this side of the grave--oh, dear, no!\" and she gave a\nshrill, elfish laugh.\n\nMr. Gorby, seeing that unless he took the bull by the horns, he would\nnever be able to get what he wanted, grew desperate, and plunged in\nMEDIAS RES.\n\n\"I am an insurance agent,\" he said, rapidly, so as to prevent any\ninterruption, \"and Mr. Fitzgerald desires to insure his life in our\ncompany. I, therefore, want to find out if he is a good life to insure;\ndoes he live temperately? keep early hours? and, in fact, all about\nhim?\"\n\n\"I shall be 'appy to answer any enquiries which may be of use to you,\nsir,\" replied Mrs. Sampson; \"knowin' as I do, 'ow good a insurance is\nto a family, should the 'ead of it be taken off unexpected, leavin' a\nwidder, which, as I know, Mr. Fitzgerald is a-goin' to be married soon,\nan' I 'opes 'e'll be 'appy, tho' thro' it I loses a lodger as 'as\nallays paid regler, an' be'aved like a gentleman.\"\n\n\"So he is a temperate man?\" said Mr. Gorby, feeling his way cautiously.\n\n\"Not bein' a blue ribbing all the same,\" answered Mrs. Sampson; \"and I\nnever saw him the wuss for drink, 'e being allays able to use his\nlatch-key, and take 'is boots off afore going to bed, which is no more\nthan a woman ought to expect from a lodger, she 'avin' to do 'er own\nwashin'.\"\n\n\"And he keeps good hours?\"\n\n\"Allays in afore the clock strikes twelve,\" answered the landlady;\n\"tho', to be sure, I uses it as a figger of speech, none of the clocks\nin the 'ouse strikin' but one, which is bein' mended, 'avin' broke\nthrough overwindin'.\"\n\n\"Is he always in before twelve?\" asked Mr. Gorby, keenly disappointed\nat this answer.\n\nMrs. Sampson eyed him waggishly, and a smile crept over her wrinkled\nlittle face.\n\n\"Young men, not bein' old men,\" she replied, cautiously, \"and sinners\nnot bein' saints, it's not nattral as latch-keys should be made for\nornament instead of use, and Mr. Fitzgerald bein' one of the 'andsomest\nmen in Melbourne, it ain't to be expected as 'e should let 'is\nlatch-key git rusty, tho' 'avin' a good moral character, 'e uses it\nwith moderation.\"\n\n\"But I suppose you are seldom awake when he comes in really late,\" said\nthe detective.\n\n\"Not as a rule,\" assented Mrs. Sampson; \"bein' a 'eavy sleeper, and\nmuch disposed for bed, but I 'ave 'eard 'im come in arter twelve, the\nlast time bein' Thursday week.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Mr. Gorby drew a long breath, for Thursday week was the night\nupon which the murder was committed.\n\n\"Bein' troubled with my 'ead,\" said Mrs. Sampson, \"thro' 'avin' been\nout in the sun all day a-washin', I did not feel so partial to my bed\nthat night as in general, so went down to the kitching with the intent\nof getting a linseed poultice to put at the back of my 'ead, it being\ncalculated to remove pain, as was told to me, when a nuss, by a doctor\nin the horspital, 'e now bein' in business for hisself, at Geelong,\nwith a large family, 'avin' married early. Just as I was leavin' the\nkitching I 'eard Mr. Fitzgerald a-comin' in, and, turnin' round, looked\nat the clock, that 'avin' been my custom when my late 'usband came in,\nin the early mornin', I bein' a-preparin' 'is meal.\"\n\n\"And the time was?\" asked Mr. Gorby, breathlessly.\n\n\"Five minutes to two o'clock,\" replied Mrs. Sampson. Mr. Gorby thought\nfor a moment.\n\n\"Cab was hailed at one o'clock--started for St. Kilda at about ten\nminutes past--reached Grammar School, say, at twenty-five minutes\npast--Fitzgerald talks five minutes to cabman, making it\nhalf-past--say, he waited ten minutes for other cab to turn up, makes\nit twenty minutes to two--it would take another twenty minutes to get\nto East Melbourne--and five minutes to walk up here--that makes it five\nminutes past two instead of before--confound it. 'Was your clock in the\nkitchen right?'\" he asked, aloud.\n\n\"Well, I think so,\" answered Mrs. Sampson. \"It does get a little slow\nsometimes, not 'avin' been cleaned for some time, which my nevy bein' a\nwatchmaker I allays 'ands it over to 'im.\"\n\n\"Of course it was slow on that night,\" said Gorby, triumphantly.\n\n\"He must have come in at five minutes past two--which makes it right.\"\n\n\"Makes what right?\" asked the landlady, sharply. \"And 'ow do you know\nmy clock was ten minutes wrong?\"\n\n\"Oh, it was, was it?\" asked Gorby, eagerly.\n\n\"I'm not denyin' of it,\" replied Mrs. Sampson; \"clocks ain't allays to\nbe relied on more than men an' women--but it won't be anythin' agin 'is\ninsurance, will it, as in general 'e's in afore twelve?\"\n\n\"Oh, all that will be quite safe,\" answered the detective, delighted\nwith the information he had obtained. \"Is this Mr. Fitzgerald's room?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is,\" replied the landlady; \"but 'e furnished it 'imself, bein'\nof a luxurus turn of mind, not but what 'is taste is good, tho' far be\nit from me to deny I 'elped 'im to select; but 'avin' another room of\nthe same to let, any friends as you might 'ave in search of a 'ome 'ud\nbe well looked arter, my references bein' very 'igh, an' my cookin'\ntasty--an' if--\"\n\nHere a ring at the front door bell called Mrs. Sampson away, so with a\nhurried word to Gorby she crackled downstairs. Left to himself, Mr.\nGorby arose and looked round the room. It was excellently furnished,\nand the pictures were good. At one end of the room, by the window,\nthere was a writing-table covered with papers.\n\n\"It's no good looking for the papers he took out of Whyte's pocket, I\nsuppose,\" said the detective to himself, as he turned over some\nletters, \"as I don't know what they are, and I couldn't tell them if I\nsaw them; but I'd like to find that missing glove and the bottle that\nheld the chloroform--unless he's done away with them. There doesn't\nseem any sign of them here, so I'll have a look in his bedroom.\"\n\nThere was no time to lose, as Mrs. Sampson might return at any moment,\nso Mr. Gorby walked quickly into the bedroom, which opened off the\nsitting-room. The first thing that caught the detective's eye was a\nlarge photograph, in a plush frame, of Madge Frettlby. It stood on the\ndressing-table, and was similar to that one which he had already seen\nin Whyte's album. He took it up with a laugh.\n\n\"You're a pretty girl,\" he said, apostrophising the picture, \"but you\ngive your photograph to two young men, both in love with you, and both\nhot-tempered. The result is that one is dead, and the other won't\nsurvive him long. That's what you've done.\"\n\nHe put it down again, and looking round the room, caught sight of a\nlight covert coat hanging behind the door and also a soft hat.\n\n\"Ah,\" said the detective, going up to the door, \"here is the very coat\nyou wore when you killed that poor fellow. Wonder what you have in the\npockets,\" and he plunged his hand into them in turn. There were an old\ntheatre programme and a pair of brown gloves in one, but in the second\npocket Mr. Gorby made a discovery--none other than that of the missing\nglove. There it was--a soiled white glove for the right hand, with\nblack bands down the back; and the detective smiled in a gratified\nmanner as he put it carefully in his pocket.\n\n\"My morning has not been wasted,\" he said to himself. \"I've found out\nthat he came in at a time which corresponds to all his movements after\none o'clock on Thursday night, and this is the missing glove, which\nclearly belonged to Whyte. If I could only get hold of the chloroform\nbottle I'd be satisfied.\"\n\nBut the chloroform bottle was not to be found, though he searched most\ncarefully for it. At last, hearing Mrs. Sampson coming upstairs again,\nhe gave up the search, and came back to the sitting-room.\n\n\"Threw it away, I suspect,\" he said, as he sat down in his, old place;\n\"but it doesn't matter. I think I can form a chain of evidence, from\nwhat I have discovered, which will be sufficient to convict him.\nBesides, I expect when he is arrested he will confess everything; he\nseems to feel remorse for what he has done.\"\n\nThe door opened, and Mrs. Sampson entered the room in a state of\nindignation.\n\n\"One of them Chinese 'awkers,\" she explained, \"'e's bin a-tryin' to git\nthe better of me over carrots--as if I didn't know what carrots\nwas--and 'im a-talkin' about a shillin' in his gibberish, as if 'e\n'adn't been brought up in a place where they don't know what a shillin'\nis. But I never could abide furreigners ever since a Frenchman, as\ntaught me 'is language, made orf with my mother's silver tea-pot,\nunbeknown to 'er, it bein' set out on the sideboard for company.\"\n\nMr. Gorby interrupted these domestic reminiscences of Mrs. Sampson's by\nstating that, now she had given him all necessary information, he would\ntake his departure.\n\n\"An' I 'opes,\" said Mrs. Sampson, as she opened the door for him, \"as\nI'll 'ave the pleasure of seein' you again should any business on\nbe'alf of Mr. Fitzgerald require it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll see you again,\" said Mr. Gorby, with heavy jocularity, \"and\nin a way you won't like, as you'll be called as a witness,\" he added,\nmentally. \"Did I understand you to say, Mrs. Sampson,\" he went on,\n\"that Mr. Fitzgerald would be at home this afternoon?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir, 'e will,\" answered Mrs. Sampson, \"a-drinkin' tea with\nhis young lady, who is Miss Frettlby, and 'as got no end of money, not\nbut what I mightn't 'ave 'ad the same 'ad I been born in a 'igher\nspear.\"\n\n\"You need not tell Mr. Fitzgerald I have been here,\" said Gorby,\nclosing the gate; \"I'll probably call and see him myself this\nafternoon.\"\n\n\"What a stout person 'e are,\" said Mrs. Sampson to herself, as the\ndetective walked away, \"just like my late father, who was allays\nfleshy, bein' a great eater, and fond of 'is glass, but I took arter my\nmother's family, they bein' thin-like, and proud of keeping 'emselves\nso, as the vinegar they drank could testify, not that I indulge in it\nmyself.\"\n\nShe shut the door, and went upstairs to take away the breakfast things,\nwhile Gorby was being driven along at a good pace to the police office,\nto obtain a warrant for Brian's arrest, on a charge of wilful murder.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nIN THE QUEEN'S NAME.\n\n\nIt was a broiling hot day--one of those cloudless days, with the\nblazing sun beating down on the arid streets, and casting deep, black\nshadows--a real Australian December day dropped by mistake of the clerk\nof the weather into the middle of August. The previous week having been\nreally chilly, it was all the more welcome.\n\nIt was Saturday morning, and fashionable Melbourne was \"doing the\nBlock.\" Collins Street is to the Southern city what Bond Street and the\nRow are to London, and the Boulevards to Paris.\n\nIt is on the Block that people show off their new dresses, bow to their\nfriends, cut their enemies, and chatter small talk. The same thing no\ndoubt occurred in the Appian Way, the fashionable street of Imperial\nRome, when Catullus talked gay nonsense to Lesbia, and Horace received\nthe congratulations of his friends over his new volume of society\nverses. History repeats itself, and every city is bound by all the laws\nof civilisation to have one special street, wherein the votaries of\nfashion can congregate.\n\nCollins Street is not, of course, such a grand thoroughfare as those\nabove mentioned, but the people who stroll up and down the broad\npavement are quite as charmingly dressed, and as pleasant as any of the\nperipatetics of those famous cities. As the sun brings out bright\nflowers, so the seductive influence of the hot weather had brought out\nall the ladies in gay dresses of innumerable colours, which made the\nlong street look like a restless rainbow.\n\nCarriages were bowling smoothly along, their occupants smiling and\nbowing as they recognised their friends on the side walk. Lawyers,\ntheir legal quibbles finished for the week, were strolling leisurely\nwith their black bags in their hands; portly merchants, forgetting\nFlinder's Lane and incoming ships, walked beside their pretty\ndaughters; and the representatives of swelldom were stalking along in\ntheir customary apparel of curly brimmed hats, high collars, and\nimmaculate suits. Altogether, it was a pleasant and animated scene,\nwhich would have delighted the heart of anyone who was not dyspeptic,\nor in love--dyspeptic people and lovers (disappointed ones, of course)\nbeing wont to survey the world in a cynical vein.\n\nMadge Frettlby was engaged in that occupation so dear to every female\nheart--shopping. She was in Moubray, Rowan, and Hicks', turning over\nribbons and laces, while the faithful Brian waited for her outside, and\namused himself by looking at the human stream which flowed along the\npavement.\n\nHe disliked shopping quite as much as the majority of his sex, and\nthough as a lover he felt a certain amount of self-abnegation to be\nbecoming in him, it was difficult to drive away the thoughts of his\npleasant club, where he could be reading and smoking, with, perchance,\nsomething cooling in a glass beside him.\n\nHowever, after she had purchased a dozen or more articles she did not\nwant, Madge remembered that Brian was waiting for her, and hurried to\nthe door.\n\n\"I haven't been many minutes, have I, dear?\" she said, touching him\nlightly on the arm.\n\n\"Oh, dear no,\" answered Brian, looking at his watch, \"only thirty--a\nmere nothing, considering a new dress was being discussed.\"\n\n\"I thought I had been longer,\" said Madge, her brow clearing; \"but\nstill I am sure you feel a martyr.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" replied Fitzgerald, handing her into the carriage; \"I\nenjoyed myself very much.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" she laughed, opening her sunshade, while Brian took his\nseat beside her; \"that's one of those social stories--which every one\nconsiders themselves bound to tell from a sense of duty. I'm afraid I\ndid keep you waiting--though, after all,\" she went on, with a true\nfeminine idea as to the flight of time, \"I was only a few minutes.\"\n\n\"And the rest,\" said Brian, quizzically looking at her pretty face, so\ncharmingly flushed under her great white hat.\n\nMadge disdained to notice this interruption.\n\n\"James,\" she cried to the coachman, \"drive to the Melbourne Club. Papa\nwill be there, you know,\" she said to Brian, \"and we'll take him off to\nhave tea with us.\"\n\n\"But it's only one o'clock,\" said Brian, as the Town Hall clock came in\nsight. \"Mrs. Sampson won't be ready.\"\n\n\"Oh, anything will do,\" replied Madge, \"a cup of tea and some thin\nbread and butter isn't hard to prepare. I don't feel like lunch, and\npapa eats so little in the middle of the day, and you--\"\n\n\"Eat a great deal at all times,\" finished Brian with a laugh.\n\nMadge went on chattering in her usual lively manner, and Brian listened\nto her with delight. Her pleasant talk drove away the evil spirit which\nhad been with him for the last three weeks. Suddenly Madge made an\nobservation as they were passing the Burke and Wills' monument, which\nstartled him.\n\n\"Isn't that the place where Mr Whyte got into the cab?\" she asked,\nlooking at the corner near the Scotch Church, where a vagrant of\nmusical tendencies was playing \"Just before the Battle, Mother,\" on a\nbattered old concertina.\n\n\"So the papers say,\" answered Brian, listlessly, without turning his\nhead.\n\n\"I wonder who the gentleman in the light coat could have been,\" said\nMadge, as she settled herself again.\n\n\"No one seems to know,\" he replied evasively.\n\n\"Ah, but they have a clue,\" she said. \"Do you know, Brian,\" she went\non, \"that he was dressed just like you in a light overcoat and soft\nhat?\"\n\n\"How remarkable,\" said Fitzgerald, speaking in a slightly sarcastic\ntone, and as calmly as he was able. \"He was dressed in the same manner\nas nine out of every ten young fellows in Melbourne.\"\n\nMadge looked at him in surprise at the tone in which he spoke, so\ndifferent from his usual nonchalant way of speaking. She was about to\nanswer when the carriage stopped at the door of the Melbourne Club.\nBrian, anxious to escape any more remarks about the murder, sprang\nquickly out, and ran up the steps into the building. He found Mr.\nFrettlby smoking complacently, and reading the AGE. As Fitzgerald\nentered he looked up, and putting down the paper, held out his hand,\nwhich the other took.\n\n\"Ah! Fitzgerald,\" he said, \"have you left the attractions of Collins\nStreet for the still greater ones of Clubland?\"\n\n\"Not I,\" answered Brian. \"I've come to carry you off to afternoon tea\nwith Madge and myself.\"\n\n\"I don't mind,\" answered Mr. Frettlby rising; \"but, isn't afternoon tea\nat half-past one rather an anomaly?\"\n\n\"What's in a name?\" said Fitzgerald, absently, as they left the room.\n\"What have you been doing all morning?\"\n\n\"I've been in here for the last half-hour reading,\" answered the other,\ncarelessly.\n\n\"Wool market, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No, the hansom cab murder.\"\n\n\"Oh, d---- that thing!\" said Brian, hastily; then, seeing his companion\nlooking at him in surprise, he apologised. \"But, indeed,\" he went on,\n\"I'm nearly worried to death by people asking about Whyte, as if I knew\nall about him, whereas I know nothing.\"\n\n\"Just as well you don't,\" answered Mr. Frettlby, as they descended the\nsteps together; \"he was not a very desirable companion.\"\n\nIt was on the tip of Brian's tongue to say, \"And yet you wanted him to\nmarry your daughter,\" but he wisely refrained, and they reached the\ncarriage in silence.\n\n\"Now then, papa,\" said Madge, when they were all settled in the\ncarriage, and it was rolling along smoothly in the direction of East\nMelbourne, \"what have you been doing?\"\n\n\"Enjoying myself,\" answered her father, \"until you and Brian came, and\ndragged me out into this blazing sunshine.\"\n\n\"Well, Brian has been so good of late,\" said Madge, \"that I had to\nreward him, so I knew that nothing would please him better than to play\nhost.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Brian, rousing himself out of a fit of abstraction,\n\"especially when one has such charming visitors.\"\n\nMadge laughed at this, and made a little grimace.\n\n\"If your tea is only equal to your compliments,\" she said lightly, \"I'm\nsure papa will forgive us for dragging him away from his club.\"\n\n\"Papa will forgive anything,\" murmured Mr. Frettlby, tilting his hat\nover his eyes, \"so long as he gets somewhere out of the sun. I can't\nsay I care about playing the parts of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego\nin the fiery furnace of a Melbourne hot day.\"\n\n\"There now, papa is quite a host in himself,\" said Madge mischievously,\nas, the carriage drew up at Mrs. Sampson's door.\n\n\"No, you are wrong,\" said Brian, as he alighted and helped her out; \"I\nam the host in myself this time.\"\n\n\"If there is one thing I hate above another,\" observed Miss Frettlby,\ncalmly, \"it's a pun, and especially a bad one.\"\n\nMrs. Sampson was very much astonished at the early arrival of her\nlodger's guests, and did not hesitate to express her astonishment.\n\n\"Bein' taken by surprise,\" she said, with an apologetic cackle, \"it\nain't to be suppose as miraculs can be performed with regard to\ncookin', the fire havin' gone out, not bein' kept alight on account of\nthe 'eat of the day, which was that 'ot as never was, tho', to be sure,\nbein' a child in the early days, I remember it were that 'ot as my\nsister's aunt was in the 'abit of roastin' her jints in the sun.\"\n\nAfter telling this last romance, and leaving her visitors in doubt\nwhether the joints referred to belonged to an animal or to her sister's\naunt or to herself, Mrs. Sampson crackled away downstairs to get things\nready.\n\n\"What a curious thing that landlady of yours is, Brian,\" said Madge,\nfrom the depths of a huge arm-chair. \"I believe she's a grasshopper\nfrom the Fitzroy Gardens.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, she's a woman,\" said Mr. Frettlby, cynically. \"You can tell\nthat by the length of her tongue.\"\n\n\"A popular error, papa,\" retorted Madge, sharply. \"I know plenty of men\nwho talk far more than any woman.\"\n\n\"I hope I'll never meet them, then,\" said Mr. Frettlby, \"for if I did I\nshould be inclined to agree with De Quincey on murder as a fine art.\"\n\nBrian winced at this, and looked apprehensively at Madge, and saw with\nrelief that she was not paying attention to her father, but was\nlistening intently.\n\n\"There she is,\" as a faint rustle at the door announced the arrival of\nMrs. Sampson and the tea-tray. \"I wonder, Brian, you don't think the\nhouse is on fire with that queer noise always going on--she wants oil!\"\n\n\"Yes, St. Jacob's oil,\" laughed Brian, as Mrs. Sampson entered, and\nplaced her burden on the table.\n\n\"Not 'avin' any cake,\" said that lady, \"thro' not being forewarned as\nto the time of arrival--tho' it's not ofting I'm taken by\nsurprise--except as to a 'eadache, which, of course, is accidental to\nevery pusson--I ain't got nothin' but bread and butter, the baker and\ngrocer both bein' all that could be desired, except in the way of\nworryin' for their money, which they thinks as 'ow I keeps the bank in\nthe 'ouse, like Allading's cave, as I've 'eard tell in the Arabian\nNights, me 'avin' gained it as a prize for English in my early\ngirl'ood, bein' then considered a scholard an' industrus.\"\n\nMrs. Sampson's shrill apologies for the absence of cake having been\nreceived, she hopped out of the room, and Madge made the tea. The\nservice was a quaint Chinese one, which Brian had picked up in his\nwanderings. He used it only on special occasions. As he watched Madge\nhe could not help thinking how pretty she looked, with her hands moving\ndeftly among the cups and saucers, so bizarre-looking with their\nsprawling dragons of yellow and green. He half smiled to himself as he\nthought, \"If they knew all, I wonder if they would sit with me so\nunconcernedly.\"\n\nMr. Frettlby, too, as he looked at his daughter, thought of his dead\nwife and sighed.\n\n\"Well,\" said Madge, as she handed them their tea, and helped herself to\nsome thin bread and butter, \"you two gentlemen are most delightful\ncompany--papa is sighing like a furnace, and Brian is staring at me\nwith his eyes like blue china saucers. You ought both to be turned\nforth to funerals like melancholy.\"\n\n\"Why like melancholy?\" queried Brian, lazily.\n\n\"I'm afraid, Mr. Fitzgerald,\" said the young lady with a smile in her\npretty black eyes, \"that you are not a student of 'A Midsummer Night's\nDream.'\"\n\n\"Very likely not,\" answered Brian; \"midsummer out here is so hot that\none gets no sleep, and, consequently no dreams. Depend upon it, if the\nfour lovers whom Puck treated so badly had lived in Australia they\nwouldn't have been able to sleep for the mosquitoes.\"\n\n\"What nonsense you two young people do talk,\" said Mr. Frettlby, with\nan amused smile, as he stirred his tea.\n\n\"Dulce est desipere in loco,\" observed Brian, gravely, \"a man who can't\ncarry out that observation is sure not to be up to much.\"\n\n\"I don't like Latin,\" said Miss Frettlby, shaking her pretty head. \"I\nagree with Heine's remark, that if the Romans had been forced to learn\nit they would not have found time to conquer the world.\"\n\n\"Which was a much more agreeable task,\" said Brian.\n\n\"And more profitable,\" finished Mr. Frettlby.\n\nThey chattered in this desultory fashion for a considerable time, till\nat last Madge rose and said they must go.\n\nBrian proposed to dine with them at St. Kilda, and then they would all\ngo to Brock's Fireworks. Madge consented to this, and she was just\npulling on her gloves when suddenly they heard a ring at the front\ndoor, and presently Mrs. Sampson talking in an excited manner at the\npitch of her voice.\n\n\"You shan't come in, I tell you,\" they heard her say shrilly, \"so it's\nno good trying, which I've allays 'eard as an Englishman's 'ouse is 'is\ncastle, an' you're a-breakin' the law, as well as a-spilin' the\ncarpets, which 'as bin newly put down.\"\n\nSome one made a reply; then the door of Brian's room was thrown open,\nand Gorby walked in, followed by another man. Fitzgerald turned as\nwhite as a sheet, for he felt instinctively that they had come for him.\nHowever, pulling himself together, he demanded, in a haughty tone, the\nreason of the intrusion.\n\nMr. Gorby walked straight over to where Brian was standing, and placed\nhis hand on the young man's shoulder.\n\n\"Brian Fitzgerald,\" he said, in a clear voice, \"I arrest you in the\nQueen's name.\"\n\n\"For what?\" asked Brian, steadily.\n\n\"The murder of Oliver Whyte.\"\n\nAt this Madge gave a cry.\n\n\"It is not true!\" she said, wildly. \"My God, it's not true.\"\n\nBrian did not answer, but, ghastly pale, held out his hands. Gorby\nslipped the handcuffs on to his wrists with a feeling of compunction,\ndespite his joy in running his man down. This done, Fitzgerald turned\nround to where Madge was standing, pale and still, as though turned\ninto stone.\n\n\"Madge,\" he said, in a clear, low voice, \"I am going to prison--perhaps\nto death; but I swear to you, by all that I hold most sacred, that I am\ninnocent of this murder.\"\n\n\"My darling!\" She made a step forward, but her father stepped before\nher.\n\n\"Keep back,\" he said, in a hard voice; \"there is nothing between you\nand that man now.\"\n\nShe turned round with an ashen face, but with a proud look in her clear\neyes.\n\n\"You are wrong,\" she answered, with a touch of scorn in her voice. \"I\nlove him more now than ever.\" Then, before her father could stop her,\nshe placed her arms round her lover's neck, and kissed him wildly.\n\n\"My darling,\" she said, with the tears streaming down her white cheeks,\n\"whatever the world may say, you are always dearest of all to me.\"\n\nBrian kissed her passionately, and moved away. Madge fell down at her\nfather's feet in a dead faint.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nCOUNSEL FOR THE PRISONER.\n\n\nBrian Fitzgerald was arrested at a few minutes past three o'clock, and\nby five all Melbourne was ringing with the news that the perpetrator of\nthe now famous hansom cab murder had been caught. The evening papers\nwere full of the affair, and the HERALD went through several editions,\nthe demand being far in the excess of the supply. Such a crime had not\nbeen committed in Melbourne since the Greer shooting case in the Opera\nHouse, and the mystery by which it was surrounded, made it even more\nsensational. The committal of the crime in such an extraordinary place\nas a hansom cab had been startling enough, but the discovery that the\nassassin was one of the most fashionable young men in Melbourne was\nstill more so. Brian Fitzgerald being well known in society as a\nwealthy squatter, and the future husband of one of the richest and\nprettiest girls in Victoria, it was no wonder that his arrest caused\nsome sensation. The HERALD, which was fortunate enough to obtain the\nearliest information about the arrest, made the best use of it, and\npublished a flaming article in its most sensational type, somewhat\nafter this fashion:--\n\n\nHANSOM CAB TRAGEDY. ARREST OF THE SUPPOSED MURDERER. STARTLING\nREVELATIONS IN HIGH LIFE.\n\n\nIt is needless to say that some of the reporters had painted the lily\npretty freely, but the public were ready to believe everything that\ncame out in the papers.\n\nMr. Frettlby, the day after Brian's arrest, had a long conversation\nwith his daughter, and wanted her to go up to Yabba Yallook Station\nuntil the public excitement had somewhat subsided. But this Madge\nflatly refused to do.\n\n\"I'm not going to desert him when he most needs me,\" she said,\nresolutely; \"everybody has turned against him, even before they have\nheard the facts of the case. He says he is not guilty, and I believe\nhim.\"\n\n\"Then let him prove his innocence,\" said her father, who was pacing\nslowly up and down the room; \"if he did not get into the cab with Whyte\nhe must have been somewhere else; so he ought to set up the defence of\nan ALIBI.\"\n\n\"He can easily do that,\" said Madge, with a ray of hope lighting up her\nsad face, \"he was here till eleven o'clock on Thursday night.\"\n\n\"Very probably,\" returned her father, dryly; \"but where was he at one\no'clock on Friday morning?\"\n\n\"Besides, Mr. Whyte left the house long before Brian did,\" she went on\nrapidly. \"You must remember--it was when you quarrelled with Mr. Whyte.\"\n\n\"My dear Madge,\" said Frettlby, stopping in front of her with a\ndispleased look, \"you are incorrect--Whyte and myself did not quarrel.\nHe asked me if it were true that Fitzgerald was engaged to you, and I\nanswered 'Yes.' That was all, and then he left the house.\"\n\n\"Yes, and Brian didn't go until two hours after,\" said Madge,\ntriumphantly. \"He never saw Mr. Whyte the whole night.\"\n\n\"So he says,\" replied Mr. Frettlby, significantly. \"I believe Brian\nbefore any one else in the world,\" said his daughter, hotly, with\nflushed cheeks and flashing eyes.\n\n\"Ah! but will a jury?\" queried her father.\n\n\"You have turned against him, too,\" answered Madge, her eyes filling\nwith tears. \"You believe him guilty.\"\n\n\"I am not prepared either to deny or confirm his guilt,\" said Mr.\nFrettlby, coldly. \"I have done what I could to help him--I have engaged\nCalton to defend him, and, if eloquence and skill can save him, you may\nset your mind at rest.\"\n\n\"My dear father,\" said Madge, throwing her arms round his neck, \"I knew\nyou would not desert him altogether, for my sake.\"\n\n\"My darling,\" replied her father, in a faltering voice, as he kissed\nher, \"there is nothing in the world I would not do for your sake.\"\n\nMeanwhile Brian was sitting in his cell in the Melbourne Jail, thinking\nsadly enough about his position. He saw no hope of escape except one,\nand that he did not intend to take advantage of.\n\n\"It would kill her; it would kill her,\" he said, feverishly, as he\npaced to and fro over the echoing stones. \"Better that the last of the\nFitzgeralds should perish like a common thief than that she should know\nthe bitter truth. If I engage a lawyer to defend me,\" he went on, \"the\nfirst question he will ask me will be where was I on that night, and if\nI tell him all will be discovered, and then--no--no--I cannot do it; it\nwould kill her, my darling,\" and throwing himself down on the bed, he\ncovered his face with his hands.\n\nHe was roused by the opening of the door of his cell, and on looking up\nsaw that it was Calton who entered. He was a great friend of\nFitzgerald's, and Brian was deeply touched by his kindness in coming to\nsee him.\n\nDuncan Calton had a kindly heart, and was anxious to help Brian, but\nthere was also a touch of self interest in the matter. He had received\na note from Mr. Frettlby, asking him to defend Fitzgerald, which he\nagreed to do with avidity, as he foresaw in this case an opportunity\nfor his name becoming known throughout the Australian colonies. It is\ntrue that he was already a celebrated lawyer, but his reputation was\npurely a local one, and as he foresaw that Fitzgerald's trial for\nmurder would cause a great sensation throughout Australia and New\nZealand, he determined to take advantage of it as another step in the\nladder which led to fame, wealth, and position. So this tall, keen-eyed\nman, with the clean shaven face and expressive mouth, advanced into the\ncell, and took Brian by the hand.\n\n\"It is very kind of you to come and see me,\" said Fitzgerald; \"it is at\na time like this that one appreciates friendship.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" answered the lawyer, fixing his keen eyes on the\nother's haggard face, as if he would read his innermost thoughts. \"I\ncame partly on my own account, and partly because Frettlby asked me to\nsee you as to your defence.\"\n\n\"Mr. Frettlby?\" said Brian, in a mechanical way. \"He is very kind; I\nthought he believed me guilty.\"\n\n\"No man is considered guilty until he has been proved so,\" answered\nCalton, evasively.\n\nBrian noticed how guarded the answer was, for he heaved an impatient\nsigh.\n\n\"And Miss Frettlby?\" he asked, in a hesitating manner. This time he got\na decided answer.\n\n\"She declines to believe you guilty, and will not hear a word said\nagainst you.\"\n\n\"God bless her,\" said Brian, fervently; \"she is a true woman. I suppose\nI am pretty well canvassed?\" he added, bitterly.\n\n\"Nothing else talked about,\" answered Calton, calmly. \"Your arrest has\nfor the present suspended all interest in theatres, cricket matches,\nand balls, and you are at the present moment being discussed threadbare\nin Clubs and drawing-rooms.\"\n\nFitzgerald writhed. He was a singularly proud man, and there was\nsomething inexpressibly galling in this unpleasant publicity.\n\n\"But this is all idle chatter,\" said Calton, taking a seat.\n\n\"We must get to business. Of course, you will accept me as your\ncounsel.\"\n\n\"It's no good my doing so,\" replied Brian, gloomily. \"The rope is\nalready round my neck.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" replied the lawyer, cheerfully, \"the rope is round no man's\nneck until he is on the scaffold. Now, you need not say a word,\" he\nwent on, holding up his hand as Brian was about to speak; \"I intend to\ndefend you, whether you like it or not. I do not know all the facts,\nexcept what the papers have stated, and they exaggerate so much that\none can place no reliance on them. At all events, I believe from my\nheart that you are innocent, and you must walk out of the prisoner's\ndock a free man, if only for the sake of that noble girl who loves you.\"\n\nBrian did not answer, but put out his hand, which the other grasped\nwarmly.\n\n\"I will not deny,\" went on Calton, \"that there is a little bit of\nprofessional curiosity about me. This case is such an extraordinary\none, that I feel as if I were unable to let slip an opportunity of\ndoing something with it. I don't care for your humdrum murders with the\npoker, and all that sort of thing, but this is something clever, and\ntherefore interesting. When you are safe we will look together for the\nreal criminal, and the pleasure of the search will be proportionate to\nthe excitement when we find him out.\"\n\n\"I agree with everything you say,\" said Fitzgerald, calmly, \"but I have\nno defence to make.\"\n\n\"No defence? You are not going to confess you killed him?\"\n\n\"No,\" with an angry flush, \"but there are certain circumstances which\nprevent me from defending myself.\"\n\n\"What nonsense,\" retorted Calton, sharply, \"as if any circumstances\nshould prevent a man from saving his own life. But never mind, I like\nthese objections; they make the nut harder to crack--but the kernel\nmust be worth getting at. Now, I want you to answer certain questions.\"\n\n\"I won't promise.\"\n\n\"Well, we shall see,\" said the lawyer, cheerfully, taking out his\nnote-book, and resting it on his knee. \"First, where were you on the\nThursday night preceding the murder?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you can, my friend. You left St. Kilda, and came up to town\nby the eleven o'clock train.\"\n\n\"Eleven-twenty,\" corrected Brian.\n\nCalton smiled in a gratified manner as he noted this down. \"A little\ndiplomacy is all that's required,\" he said mentally.\n\n\"And where did you go then?\" he added, aloud.\n\n\"I met Rolleston in the train, and we took a cab from the Flinders\nStreet station up to the Club.\"\n\n\"What Club?\"\n\n\"The Melbourne Club.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" interrogatively.\n\n\"Rolleston went home, and I went into the Club and played cards for a\ntime.\"\n\n\"When did you leave the Club?\"\n\n\"A few minutes to one o'clock in the morning.\"\n\n\"And then, I suppose, you went home?\"\n\n\"No; I did not.\"\n\n\"Then where did you go?\"\n\n\"Down the street.\"\n\n\"Rather vague. I presume you mean Collins Street?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You were going to meet some one, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I never said so.\"\n\n\"Probably not; but young men don't wander about the streets at night\nwithout some object.\"\n\n\"I was restless and wanted a walk.\"\n\n\"Indeed! How curious you should prefer going into the heart of the\ndusty town for a walk to strolling through the Fitzroy Gardens, which\nwere on your way home! It won't do; you had an appointment to meet some\none.\"\n\n\"Well--er--yes.\"\n\n\"I thought as much. Man or woman?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you.\"\n\n\"Then I must find out for myself.\"\n\n\"You can't.\"\n\n\"Indeed! Why not?\"\n\n\"You don't know where to look for her.\"\n\n\"Her,\" cried Calton, delighted at the success of his craftily-put\nquestion. \"I knew it was a woman.\"\n\nBrian did not answer, but sat biting his lips with vexation.\n\n\"Now, who is this woman?\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"Come now, Fitzgerald, I know that young men will be young men, and, of\ncourse, you don't like these things talked about; but in this case your\ncharacter must be sacrificed to save your neck. What is her name?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you.\"\n\n\"Oh! you know it, then?\"\n\n\"Well, yes.\"\n\n\"And you won't tell me?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\nCalton, however, had found out two things that pleased him; first, that\nFitzgerald had an appointment, and, second that it had been with a\nwoman. He pursued another line.\n\n\"When did you last see Whyte!\"\n\nBrian answered with great reluctance, \"I saw him drunk by the Scotch\nChurch.\"\n\n\"What! you were the man who hailed the hansom?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" assented the other, hesitating slightly, \"I was!\"\n\nThe thought flashed through Calton's brain as to whether the young man\nbefore him was guilty or not, and he was obliged to confess that things\nlooked very black against him.\n\n\"Then what the newspapers said was correct?\"\n\n\"Partly.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Calton drew a long breath--here was a ray of hope.\n\n\"You did not know it was Whyte when you found him lying drunk near the\nScotch Church?\"\n\n\"No, I did not. Had I known it was he I would not have picked him up.\"\n\n\"Of course, you recognised him afterwards?\"\n\n\"Yes I did. And, as the paper stated, I dropped him and walked away.\"\n\n\"Why did you leave him so abruptly?\"\n\nBrian looked at his questioner in some surprise.\n\n\"Because I detested him,\" he said, shortly.\n\n\"Why did you detest him?\"\n\nNo answer. \"Was it because he admired Miss Frettlby, and from all\nappearances, was going to marry her?\"\n\n\"Well, yes,\" sullenly.\n\n\"And now,\" said Calton, impressively, \"this is the whole point upon\nwhich the case turns. Why did you get into the cab with him?\"\n\n\"I did not get into the cab.\"\n\n\"The cabman declares that you did.\"\n\n\"He is wrong. I never came back after I recognised Whyte.\"\n\n\"Then who was the man who got into the cab with Whyte?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"You have no idea?\"\n\n\"Not the least.\"\n\n\"You are certain?\"\n\n\"Yes, perfectly certain.\"\n\n\"He seems to have been dressed exactly like you.\"\n\n\"Very probably. I could name at least a dozen of my acquaintances who\nwear light coats over their evening dress, and soft hats.\"\n\n\"Do you know if Whyte had any enemies?\"\n\n\"No, I don't; I know nothing about him, beyond that he came from\nEngland a short time ago with a letter of introduction to Mr. Frettlby,\nand had the impertinence to ask Madge to marry him.\"\n\n\"Where did Whyte live?\"\n\n\"Down in St. Kilda, at the end of Grey Street.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"It was in the papers, and--and--\" hesitatingly, \"I called on him.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"To see if he would cease his attentions to Madge, and to tell him that\nshe was engaged to me.\"\n\n\"And what did he say?\"\n\n\"Laughed at me. Curse him.\"\n\n\"You had high words, evidently?\"\n\nBrian laughed bitterly.\n\n\"Yes, we had.\"\n\n\"Did anyone hear you?\"\n\n\"The landlady did, I think. I saw her in the passage as I left the\nhouse.\"\n\n\"The prosecution will bring her forward as a witness.\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" indifferently.\n\n\"Did you say anything likely to incriminate yourself?\" Fitzgerald\nturned away his head.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered in a low voice, \"I spoke very wildly--indeed, I did\nnot know at the time what I said.\"\n\n\"Did you threaten him?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did. I told him I would kill him if he persisted in his plan of\nmarrying Madge.\"\n\n\"Ah! if the landlady can swear that she heard you say so, it will form\na strong piece of evidence against you. So far as I can see, there is\nonly one defence, and that is an easy one--you must prove an ALIBI.\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"You say you did not come back and get into the cab?\" said Calton,\nwatching the face of the other closely.\n\n\"No, it was some one else dressed like me.\"\n\n\"And you have no idea who it was?\"\n\n\"No, I have not.\"\n\n\"Then, after you left Whyte, and walked along Russell Street, where did\nyou go?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you.\"\n\n\"Were you intoxicated?\"\n\n\"No!\" indignantly\n\n\"Then you remember?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And where were you?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you.\"\n\n\"You refuse.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.\"\n\n\"Take time to consider. You may have to pay a heavy price for your\nrefusal.\"\n\n\"If necessary, I will pay it.\"\n\n\"And you won't tell me where you were?\"\n\n\"No, I won't.\"\n\nCalton was beginning to feel annoyed.\n\n\"You're very foolish,\" he said, \"sacrificing your life to some feeling\nof false modesty. You must prove an ALIBI.\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"At what hour did you get home?\"\n\n\"About two o'clock in the morning.\"\n\n\"Did you walk home?\"\n\n\"Yes--through the Fitzroy Gardens.\"\n\n\"Did you see anyone on your way home?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I wasn't paying attention.\"\n\n\"Did anyone see you?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of.\"\n\n\"Then you refuse to tell me where you were between one and two o'clock\non Friday morning?\"\n\n\"Absolutely!\"\n\nCalton thought for a moment, to consider his next move.\n\n\"Did you know that Whyte carried valuable papers about with him?\"\n\nFitzgerald hesitated, and turned pale.\n\n\"No! I did not know,\" he said, reluctantly.\n\nThe lawyer made a master stroke.\n\n\"Then why did you take them from him?\"\n\n\"What! Had he it with him?\"\n\nCalton saw his advantage, and seized it at once.\n\n\"Yes, he had it with him. Why did you take it?\"\n\n\"I did not take it. I didn't even know he had it with him.\"\n\n\"Indeed! Will you kindly tell me what 'it' is.\" Brian saw the trap into\nwhich he had fallen.\n\n\"No! I will not,\" he answered steadily.\n\n\"Was it a jewel?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Was it an important paper?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Ah! It was a paper. I can see it in your face. And was that paper of\nimportance to you?\"\n\n\"Why do you ask?\"\n\nCalton fixed his keen grey eyes steadily on Brian's face.\n\n\"Because,\" he answered slowly, \"the man to whom that paper was of such\nvalue murdered Whyte.\"\n\nBrian started up, ghastly pale.\n\n\"My God!\" he almost shrieked, stretching out his hands, \"it is true\nafter all,\" and he fell down on the stone pavement in a dead faint.\n\nCalton, alarmed, summoned the gaoler, and between them they placed him\non the bed, and dashed some cold water over his face. He recovered, and\nmoaned feebly, while Calton, seeing that he was unfit to be spoken to,\nleft the prison. When he got outside he stopped for a moment and looked\nback on the grim, grey walls.\n\n\"Brian Fitzgerald,\" he said to himself \"you did not commit the murder\nyourself, but you know who did.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nSHE WAS A TRUE WOMAN.\n\n\nMelbourne society was greatly agitated over the hansom cab murder.\nBefore the assassin had been discovered it had been looked upon merely\nas a common murder, and one of which society need take no cognisance\nbeyond the bare fact of its committal. But now that one of the most\nfashionable young men in Melbourne had been arrested as the assassin,\nit bade fair to assume gigantic proportions. Mrs. Grundy was shocked,\nand openly talked about having nourished in her bosom a viper which had\nunexpectedly turned and stung her.\n\nMorn, noon, and night, in Toorak drawing-rooms and Melbourne Clubs, the\ncase formed the principal subject of conversation. And Mrs. Grundy was\nhorrified. Here was a young man, well born--\"the Fitzgeralds, my dear,\nan Irish family, with royal blood in their veins\"--well-bred--\"most\ncharming manners, I assure you, and so very good-looking\" and engaged\nto one of the richest girls in Melbourne--\"pretty enough, madam, no\ndoubt, but he wanted her money, sly dog;\" and this young man, who had\nbeen petted by the ladies, voted a good fellow by the men, and was\nuniversally popular, both in drawing-room and club, had committed a\nvulgar murder--it was truly shocking. What was the world coming to, and\nwhat were gaols and lunatic asylums built for if men of young\nFitzgerald's calibre were not put in them, and kept from killing\npeople? And then, of course, everybody asked everybody else who Whyte\nwas, and why he had never been heard of before. All people who had met\nMr. Whyte were worried to death with questions about him, and underwent\na species of social martyrdom as to who he was, what he was like, why\nhe was killed, and all the rest of the insane questions which some\npeople will ask. It was talked about everywhere--in fashionable\ndrawing-rooms at five o'clock tea, over thin bread and butter and\nsouchong; at clubs, over brandies and sodas and cigarettes; by working\nmen over their mid-day pint, and by their wives in the congenial\natmosphere of the back yard over the wash-tub. The papers were full of\nparagraphs about the famous murder, and the society papers gave an\ninterview with the prisoner by their special reporters, which had been\ncomposed by those gentlemen out of the floating rumours which they\nheard around, and their own fertile imaginations.\n\nAs to the prisoner's guilt, everyone was certain of it. The cabman\nRoyston had sworn that Fitzgerald had got into the cab with Whyte, and\nwhen he got out Whyte was dead. There could be no stronger proof than\nthat, and the general opinion was that the prisoner would put in no\ndefence, but would throw himself on the mercy of the court. Even the\nchurch caught the contagion, and ministers--Anglican, Roman Catholic,\nand Presbyterian, together with the lesser lights of minor\ndenominations--took the hansom cab murder as a text whereon to preach\nsermons on the profligacy of the age, and to point out that the only\nark which could save men from the rising flood of infidelity and\nimmorality was their own particular church. \"Gad,\" as Calton remarked,\nafter hearing five or six ministers each claim their own church as the\none special vessel of safety, \"there seems to be a whole fleet of arks!\"\n\nFor Mr. Felix Rolleston, acquainted as he was with all concerned, the\ntime was one of great and exceeding joy. He was ever to the fore in\nretailing to his friends, plus certain garnishments of his own, any\nfresh evidence that chanced to come to light. His endeavour was to\nrender it the more piquant, if not dramatic. If you asked him for his\ndefinite opinion as to the innocence or guilt of the accused, Mr. Felix\nshook his head sagaciously, and gave you to understand that neither he,\nnor his dear friend Calton--he knew Calton to nod to--had yet been able\nto make up their minds about the matter.\n\n\"Fact is, don't you know,\" observed Mr. Rolleston, wisely, \"there's\nmore in this than meets the eye, and all that sort of thing--think\n'tective fellers wrong myself--don't think Fitz killed Whyte; jolly\nwell sure he didn't.\"\n\nThis would be followed invariably by a query in chorus of \"who killed\nhim then?\"\n\n\"Aha,\" Felix would retort, putting his head on one side, like a\nmeditative sparrow; \"'tective fellers can't find out; that's the\ndifficulty. Good mind to go on the prowl myself, by Jove.\"\n\n\"But do you know anything of the detective business?\" some one would\nask.\n\n\"Oh, dear yes,\" with an airy wave of his hand; \"I've read Gaboreau, you\nknow; awfully jolly life, 'tectives.\"\n\nDespite this evasion, Rolleston, in his heart of hearts, believed\nFitzgerald guilty. But he was one of those persons, who having either\ntender hearts or obstinate natures--the latter is perhaps the more\ngeneral--deem it incumbent upon them to come forward in championship of\nthose in trouble. There are, doubtless, those who think that Nero was a\npleasant young man, whose cruelties were but the resultant of an\noverflow of high spirits; and who regard Henry VIII. in the light of a\nhenpecked husband unfortunate in the possession of six wives. These\npeople delight in expressing their sympathy with great scoundrels of\nthe Ned Kelly order. They view them as the embodiment of heroism,\nunsympathetically and disgracefully treated by the narrow understanding\nof the law. If one half the world does kick a man when he is down, the\nother half invariably consoles the prostrate individual with halfpence.\n\nAnd therefore, even while the weight of public opinion was dead against\nFitzgerald he had his share of avowed sympathy. There was a comfort in\nthis for Madge. Not that if the whole countryside had unanimously\ncondemned her lover she would have believed him guilty. The element of\nlogic does not enter into the championship of woman. Her love for a man\nis sufficient to exalt him to the rank of a demi-god. She absolutely\nrefuses to see the clay feet of her idol. When all others forsake she\nclings to him, when all others frown she smiles on him, and when he\ndies she reveres his memory as that of a saint and a martyr. Young men\nof the present day are prone to disparage their womenkind; but a poor\nthing is the man, who in time of trouble has no woman to stand by him\nwith cheering words and loving comfort. And so Madge Frettlby, true\nwoman that she was, had nailed her colours to the mast. She refused\nsurrender to anyone, or before any argument. He was innocent, and his\ninnocence would be proved, for she had an intuitive feeling that he\nwould be saved at the eleventh hour. How, she knew not; but she was\ncertain that it would be so. She would have gone to see Brian in\nprison, but that her father absolutely forbade her doing so. Therefore\nshe was dependent upon Calton for all the news respecting him, and any\nmessage which she wished conveyed.\n\nBrian's persistent refusal to set up the defence of an ALIBI, annoyed\nCalton, the more so as he could conceive no reason sufficiently worthy\nof the risk to which it subjected his client.\n\n\"If it's for the sake of a woman,\" he said to Brian, \"I don't care who\nshe is, it's absurdly Quixotic. Self-preservation is the first law of\nnature, and if my neck was in danger I'd spare neither man, woman, nor\nchild to save it.\"\n\n\"I dare say,\" answered Brian; \"but if you had my reasons you might\nthink differently.\"\n\nYet in his own mind the lawyer had a suspicion which he thought might\nperhaps account for Brian's obstinate concealment of his movements on\nthe fatal night. He had admitted an appointment with a woman. He was a\nhandsome young fellow, and probably his morals were no better than\nthose of his fellows. There was perhaps some intrigue with a married\nwoman. He had perchance been with her on that night, and it was to\nshield her that he refused to speak.\n\n\"Even so,\" argued Calton, \"let him lose his character rather than his\nlife; indeed the woman herself should speak. It would be hard upon her\nI admit; yet when a man's life is in danger, surely nothing should stop\nher.\"\n\nFull of these perplexing thoughts, Calton went down to St. Kilda to\nhave a talk with Madge. He intended to ask her to assist him towards\nobtaining the information he needed. He had a great respect for Madge,\nand thought her a really clever woman. It was just possible, he argued,\nthat Brian's great love might cause him to confess everything to her,\nat her urgent request. He found Madge awaiting his arrival with anxiety.\n\n\"Where have you been all this time?\" she said as they sat down; \"I have\nbeen counting every moment since I saw you last. How is he?\"\n\n\"Just the same,\" answered Calton, taking off his gloves, \"still\nobstinately refusing to save his own life. Where's your father?\" he\nasked, suddenly.\n\n\"Out of town,\" she answered, impatiently. \"He will not be back for a\nweek--but what do you mean that he won't save his own life?\"\n\nCalton leaned forward, and took her hand.\n\n\"Do you want to save his life?\" he asked.\n\n\"Save his life,\" she reiterated, starting up out of her chair with a\ncry. \"God knows, I would die to save him.\"\n\n\"Pish,\" murmured Calton to himself, as he looked at her glowing face\nand outstretched hands, \"these women are always in extremes. The fact\nis,\" he said aloud, \"Fitzgerald is able to prove an ALIBI, and he\nrefuses to do so.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\nCalton shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"That is best known to himself--some Quixotic idea of honour, I fancy.\nNow, he refuses to tell me where he was on that night; perhaps he won't\nrefuse to tell you--so you must come up and see him with me, and\nperhaps he will recover his senses, and confess.\"\n\n\"But my father,\" she faltered.\n\n\"Did you not say he was out of town?\" asked Calton.\n\n\"Yes,\" hesitated Madge. \"But he told me not to go.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Calton, rising and taking up his hat and gloves,\n\"I won't ask you.\"\n\nShe laid her hand on his arm.\n\n\"Stop! will it do any good?\"\n\nCalton hesitated a moment, for he thought that if the reason of Brian's\nsilence was, as he surmised, an intrigue with a married woman, he might\nnot tell the girl he was engaged to about it--but, on the other hand,\nthere might be some other reason, and Calton trusted to Madge to find\nit out. With these thoughts in his mind he turned round.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered, boldly, \"it may save his life.\"\n\n\"Then I shall go,\" she answered, recklessly. \"He is more to me than my\nfather, and if I can save him, I will. Wait,\" and she ran out of the\nroom.\n\n\"An uncommonly plucky girl,\" murmured the lawyer, as he looked out of\nthe window. \"If Fitzgerald is not a fool he will certainly tell her\nall--that is, of course, if he is able to--queer things these women\nare--I quite agree with Balzac's saying that no wonder man couldn't\nunderstand woman, seeing that God who created her failed to do so.\"\n\nMadge came back dressed to go out, with a heavy veil over her face.\n\n\"Shall I order the carriage?\" she asked, pulling on her gloves with\ntrembling fingers.\n\n\"Hardly,\" answered Calton, dryly, \"unless you want to see a paragraph\nin the society papers to the effect that Miss Madge Frettlby visited\nMr. Fitzgerald in gaol--no--no--we'll get a cab. Come, my dear,\" and\ntaking her arm he led her away.\n\nThey reached the station, and caught a train just as it started, yet\nnotwithstanding this Madge was in a fever of impatience.\n\n\"How slowly it goes,\" she said, fretfully.\n\n\"Hush, my dear,\" said Calton, laying his hand on her arm. \"You will\nbetray yourself--we'll arrive soon--and save him.\"\n\n\"Oh, God grant we may,\" she said with a low cry, clasping her hands\ntightly together, while Calton could see the tears falling from under\nher thick veil.\n\n\"This is not the way to do so,\" he said, almost roughly, \"you'll be in\nhysterics soon--control yourself for his sake.\"\n\n\"For his sake,\" she muttered, and with a powerful effort of will,\ncalmed herself. They soon arrived in Melbourne, and, getting a hansom,\ndrove up quickly to the gaol. After going through the usual formula,\nthey entered the cell where Brian was, and, when the warder who\naccompanied them opened the door, they found the young man seated on\nhis bed. He looked up, and, on seeing Madge, rose and held out his\nhands with a cry of delight. She ran forward, and threw herself on his\nbreast with a stifled sob. For a short time no one spoke--Calton being\nat the other end of the cell, busy with some notes which he had taken\nfrom his pocket, and the warder having retired.\n\n\"My poor darling,\" said Madge, stroking back the soft, fair hair from\nhis flushed forehead, \"how ill you look.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" answered Fitzgerald, with a hard laugh. \"Prison does not improve\na man--does it?\"\n\n\"Don't speak in that tone, Brian,\" she said; \"it is not like you--let\nus sit down and talk calmly over the matter.\"\n\n\"I don't see what good that will do,\" he answered, wearily, as they sat\ndown hand-in-hand. \"I have talked about it to Calton till my head\naches, and it is no good.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" retorted the lawyer, sharply, as he also sat down.\n\"Nor will it be any good until you come to your senses, and tell us\nwhere you were on that night.\"\n\n\"I tell you I cannot.\"\n\n\"Brian, dear,\" said Madge, softly, taking his hand, \"you must tell\nall--for my sake.\"\n\nFitzgerald sighed--this was the hardest temptation he had yet been\nsubjected to. He felt half inclined to yield, and chance the result--but\none look at Madge's pure face steeled him against doing so. What could\nhis confession bring but sorrow and regret to one whom he loved better\nthan his life.\n\n\"Madge!\" he answered, gravely, taking her hand again, \"you do not know\nwhat you ask.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do!\" she replied, quickly. \"I ask you to save yourself--to\nprove that you are not guilty of this terrible crime, and not to\nsacrifice your life for the sake of--of--\"\n\nHere she stopped, and looked helplessly at Calton, for she had no idea\nof the reason of Fitzgerald's refusal to speak.\n\n\"For the sake of a woman,\" finished Calton, bluntly.\n\n\"A woman!\" she faltered, still holding her lover's hand.\n\n\"Is--is--is that the reason?\"\n\nBrian averted his face.\n\n\"Yes!\" he said, in a low, rough voice.\n\nA sharp expression of anguish crossed her pale face, and, sinking her\nhead on her hands, she wept bitterly. Brian looked at her in a dogged\nkind of way, and Calton stared grimly at them both.\n\n\"Look here,\" he said, at length, to Brian, in an angry voice; \"if you\nwant my opinion of your conduct I think it's infamous--begging your\npardon, Miss Frettlby, for the expression. Here is this noble girl, who\nloves you with her whole heart, and is ready to sacrifice everything\nfor your sake, comes to implore you to save your life, and you coolly\nturn round and acknowledge another woman.\"\n\nBrian lifted his head haughtily, and his face flushed.\n\n\"You are wrong,\" he said, turning round sharply; \"there is the woman\nfor whose sake I keep silence;\" and, rising up from the bed, he pointed\nto Madge, as she sobbed bitterly on it. She lifted up her haggard face\nwith an air of surprise.\n\n\"For my sake!\" she cried in a startled voice.\n\n\"Oh, he's mad,\" said Calton, shrugging his shoulders; \"I shall put in a\ndefence of insanity.\"\n\n\"No, I am not mad,\" cried Fitzgerald, wildly, as he caught Madge in his\narms. \"My darling! My darling! It is for your sake that I keep silence,\nand I shall do so though my life pays the penalty. I could tell you\nwhere I was on that night and save myself: but if I did, you would\nlearn a secret which would curse your life, and I dare not speak--I\ndare not.\"\n\nMadge looked up into his face with a pitiful smile as her--tears fell\nfast.\n\n\"Dearest!\" she said, softly. \"Do not think of me, but only of yourself;\nbetter that I should endure misery than that you should die. I do not\nknow what the secret can be, but if the telling of it will save your\nlife, do not hesitate. See,\" she cried, falling on her knees, \"I am at\nyour feet--I implore you by all the love you ever had for me, to save\nyourself, whatever the consequences may be to me.\"\n\n\"Madge,\" said Fitzgerald, as he raised her in his arms, \"at one time I\nmight have done so, but now it is too late. There is another and\nstronger reason for my silence, which I have only found out since my\narrest. I know that I am closing up the one way of escape from this\ncharge of murder, of which I am innocent; but as there is a God in\nheaven, I swear that I will not speak.\"\n\nThere was a silence in the cell, broken only by Madge's convulsive\nsobs, and even Calton, cynical man of the world as he was, felt his\neyes grow wet. Brian led Madge over to him, and placed her in his arms.\n\n\"Take her away,\" he said, in a broken voice, \"or I shall forget that I\nam a man;\" and turning away he threw himself on his bed, and covered\nhis face with his hands. Calton did not answer him, but summoned the\nwarder, and tried to lead Madge away. But just as they reached the door\nshe broke away from him, and, running back, flung herself on her\nlover's breast.\n\n\"My darling! My darling!\" she sobbed, kissing him, \"you shall not die.\nI shall save you in spite of yourself;\" and, as if afraid to trust\nherself longer, she ran out of the cell, followed by the barrister.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nMADGE MAKES A DISCOVERY.\n\n\nMadge stepped into the cab, and Calton paused a moment to tell the\ncabman to drive to the railway station. Suddenly she stopped him.\n\n\"Tell him to drive to Brian's lodgings in Powlett Street,\" she said,\nlaying her hand on Calton's arm.\n\n\"What for?\" asked the lawyer, in astonishment.\n\n\"And also to go past the Melbourne Club, as I want to stop there.\"\n\n\"What the deuce does she mean?\" muttered Calton, as he gave the\nnecessary orders, and stepped into the cab.\n\n\"And now,\" he asked, looking at his companion, who had let down her\nveil, while the cab rattled quickly down the street, \"what do you\nintend to do?\"\n\nShe threw back her veil, and he was astonished to see the sudden change\nwhich had come over her. There were no tears now, and her eyes were\nhard and glittering, while her mouth was firmly closed. She looked like\na woman who had determined to do a certain thing, and would carry out\nher intention at whatever cost.\n\n\"I intend to save Brian in spite of himself,\" she said, very distinctly.\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"Ah, you think that, being a woman, I can do nothing,\" she said,\nbitterly. \"Well, you shall see.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" retorted Calton, with a grim smile, \"my opinion of\nyour sex has always been an excellent one--every lawyer's is; stands to\nreason that it should be so, seeing that a woman is at the bottom of\nnine cases out of ten.\"\n\n\"The old cry.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless a true one,\" answered Calton. \"Ever since the time of\nFather Adam it has been acknowledged that women influence the world\neither for good or evil more than men. But this is not to the point,\"\nhe went on, rather impatiently.\n\n\"What do you propose to do?\"\n\n\"Simply this,\" she answered. \"In the first place, I may tell you that I\ndo not understand Brian's statement that he keeps silence for my sake,\nas there are no secrets in my life that can justify his saying so. The\nfacts of the case are simply these: Brian, on the night in question,\nleft our house at St. Kilda, at eleven o'clock. He told me that he\nwould call at the Club to see if there were any letters for him, and\nthen go straight home.\"\n\n\"But he might have said that merely as a blind.\"\n\nMadge shook her head.\n\n\"No, I don't think so. I did not ask him where he was going. He told me\nquite spontaneously. I know Brian's character, and he would not tell a\ndeliberate lie, especially when there was no necessity for it. I am\nquite certain that he intended to do as he said, and go straight home.\nWhen he got to the Club, he found a letter there, which caused him to\nalter his mind.\"\n\n\"From whom was the letter?\"\n\n\"Can't you guess,\" she said impatiently. \"From the person, man or\nwoman, who wanted to see him and reveal this secret about me, whatever\nit is. He got the letter at his Club, and went down Collins Street to\nmeet the writer. At the corner of the Scotch Church he found Mr. Whyte,\nand on recognising him, left in disgust, and walked down Russell Street\nto keep his appointment.\"\n\n\"Then you don't think he came back.\"\n\n\"I am certain he did not, for, as Brian told you, there are plenty of\nyoung men who wear the same kind of coat and hat as he does. Who the\nsecond man who got into the cab was I do not know, but I will swear\nthat it was not Brian.\"\n\n\"And you are going to look for that letter?\"\n\n\"Yes, in Brian's lodgings.\"\n\n\"He might have burnt it.\"\n\n\"He might have done a thousand things, but he did not,\" she answered.\n\"Brian is the most careless man in the world; he would put the letter\ninto his pocket, or throw it into the waste-paper basket, and never\nthink of it again.\"\n\n\"In this case he did, however.\"\n\n\"Yes, he thought of the conversation he had with the writer, but not of\nthe letter itself. Depend upon it, we shall find it in his desk, or in\none of the pockets of the clothes he wore that night.\"\n\n\"Then there's another thing,\" said Calton, thoughtfully. \"The letter\nmight, have been delivered to him between the Elizabeth Street Railway\nStation and the Club.\"\n\n\"We can soon find out about that,\" answered Madge; \"for Mr. Rolleston\nwas with him at the time.\"\n\n\"So he was,\" answered Calton; \"and here is Rolleston coming down the\nstreet. We'll ask him now.\"\n\nThe cab was just passing the Burke and Wills' monument, and Calton's\nquick eye had caught a glimpse of Rolleston walking down the left-hand\nside. What first attracted Calton's attention was the glittering\nappearance of Felix. His well-brushed top hat glittered, his varnished\nboots glittered, and his rings and scarf-pin glittered; in fact, so\nresplendent was his appearance that he looked like an animated diamond\ncoming along in the blazing sunshine.\n\nThe cab drove up to the kerb, and Rolleston stopped short, as Calton\nsprang out directly in front of him. Madge lay back in the cab and\npulled down her veil, not wishing to be recognised by Felix, as she\nknew that if he did it would soon be all over the town.\n\n\"Hallo! old chap,\" said Rolleston, in considerable astonishment. \"Where\ndid you spring from?\"\n\n\"From the cab, of course,\" answered Calton, with a laugh.\n\n\"A kind of DEUS EX MACHINA,\" replied Rolleston, attempting a bad pun.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Calton. \"Look here, Rolleston, do you remember the\nnight of Whyte's murder--you met Fitzgerald at the Railway Station.\"\n\n\"In the train,\" corrected Felix.\n\n\"Well, well, no matter, you came up with him to the Club.\"\n\n\"Yes, and left him there.\"\n\n\"Did you notice if he received any message while he was with you?\"\n\n\"Any message?\" repeated Felix. \"No, he did not; we were talking\ntogether the whole time, and he spoke to no one but me.\"\n\n\"Was he in good spirits?\"\n\n\"Excellent, made me laugh awfully--but why all this thusness?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing,\" answered Calton, getting back into the cab. \"I wanted a\nlittle information from you; I'll explain next time I see you--\nGood-bye!\"\n\n\"But I say,\" began Felix, but the cab had already rattled away, so Mr.\nRolleston turned angrily away.\n\n\"I never saw anything like these lawyers,\" he said to himself.\n\n\"Calton's a perfect whirlwind, by Jove.\"\n\nMeanwhile Calton was talking to Madge.\n\n\"You were right,\" he said, \"there must have been a message for him at\nthe Club, for he got none from the time he left your place.\"\n\n\"And what shall we do now?\" asked Madge, who, having heard all the\nconversation, did not trouble to question the lawyer about it.\n\n\"Find out at the Club if any letter was waiting for him on that night,\"\nsaid Calton, as the cab stopped at the door of the Melbourne Club.\n\"Here we are,\" and with a hasty word to Madge, he ran up the steps.\n\nHe went to the office of the Club to find out if any letters had been\nwaiting for Fitzgerald, and found there a waiter with whom he was\npretty well acquainted.\n\n\"Look here, Brown,\" said the lawyer, \"do you remember on that Thursday\nnight when the hansom cab murder took place if any letters were waiting\nhere for Mr. Fitzgerald?\"\n\n\"Well, really, sir,\" hesitated Brown, \"it's so long ago that I almost\nforget.\"\n\nCalton gave him a sovereign.\n\n\"Oh! it's not that, Mr. Calton,\" said the waiter, pocketing the coin,\nnevertheless. \"But I really do forget.\"\n\n\"Try and remember,\" said Calton, shortly.\n\nBrown made a tremendous effort of memory, and at last gave a\nsatisfactory answer.\n\n\"No, sir, there were none!\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\" said Calton, feeling a thrill of disappointment.\n\n\"Quite sure, sir,\" replied the other, confidently, \"I went to the\nletter rack several times that night, and I am sure there were none for\nMr. Fitzgerald.\"\n\n\"Ah! I thought as much,\" said Calton, heaving a sigh.\n\n\"Stop!\" said Brown, as though struck with a sudden idea. \"Though there\nwas no letter came by post, sir, there was one brought to him on that\nnight.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Calton, turning sharply. \"At what time?\"\n\n\"Just before twelve o'clock, sir.\"\n\n\"Who brought it?\"\n\n\"A young woman, sir,\" said Brown, in a tone of disgust. \"A bold thing,\nbeggin' your pardon, sir; and no better than she should be. She bounced\nin at the door as bold as brass, and sings out, 'Is he in?' 'Get out,'\nI says, 'or I'll call the perlice.' 'Oh no, you won't,' says she.\n'You'll give him that,' and she shoves a letter into my hands. 'Who's\nhim?' I asks. 'I dunno,' she answers. 'It's written there, and I can't\nread; give it him at once.' And then she clears out before I could stop\nher.\"\n\n\"And the letter was for Mr. Fitzgerald?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; and a precious dirty letter it was, too.\"\n\n\"You gave it to him, of course?\"\n\n\"I did, sir. He was playing cards, and he put it in his pocket, after\nhaving looked at the outside of it, and went on with his game.\"\n\n\"Didn't he open it?\"\n\n\"Not then, sir; but he did later on, about a quarter to one o'clock. I\nwas in the room, and he opens it and reads it. Then he says to himself,\n'What d--d impertinence,' and puts it into his pocket.\"\n\n\"Was he disturbed!\"\n\n\"Well, sir, he looked angry like, and put his coat and hat on, and\nwalked out about five minutes to one.\"\n\n\"Ah! and he met Whyte at one,\" muttered Calton. \"There's no doubt about\nit. The letter was an appointment, and he was going to keep it. What\nkind of a letter was it?\" he asked.\n\n\"Very dirty, sir, in a square envelope; but the paper was good, and so\nwas the writing.\"\n\n\"That will do,\" said Calton; \"I am much obliged to you,\" and he hurried\ndown to where Madge awaited him in the cab.\n\n\"You were right,\" he said to her, when the cab was once more in motion.\n\"He got a letter on that night, and went to keep his appointment at the\ntime he met Whyte.\"\n\n\"I knew it,\" cried Madge with delight. \"You see, we will find it in his\nlodgings.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" answered Calton; \"but we must not be too sanguine; he may\nhave destroyed it.\"\n\n\"No, he has not,\" she replied. \"I am convinced it is there.\"\n\n\"Well,\" answered Calton, looking at her, \"I don't contradict you, for\nyour feminine instincts have done more to discover the truth than my\nreasonings; but that is often the case with women--they jump in the\ndark where a man would hesitate, and in nine cases out of ten land\nsafely.\"\n\n\"Alas for the tenth!\" said Miss Frettlby. \"She has to be the one\nexception to prove the rule.\"\n\nShe had in a great measure recovered her spirits, and seemed confident\nthat she would save her lover. But Mr. Calton saw that her nerves were\nstrung up to the highest pitch, and that it was only her strong will\nthat kept her from breaking down altogether.\n\n\"By Jove,\" he muttered, in an admiring tone, as he watched her. \"She's\na plucky girl, and Fitzgerald is a lucky man to have the love of such a\nwoman.\"\n\nThey soon arrived at Brian's lodgings, and the door was opened by Mrs.\nSampson, who looked very disconsolate indeed. The poor cricket had been\nblaming herself severely for the information she had given to the false\ninsurance agent, and the floods of tears which she had wept had\napparently had an effect on her physical condition, for she crackled\nless loudly than usual, though her voice was as shrill as ever.\n\n\"That sich a thing should 'ave 'appened to 'im,\" she wailed, in her\nthin, high voice. \"An' me that proud of 'im, not 'avin' any family of\nmy own, except one as died and went up to 'eaving arter 'is father,\nwhich I 'opes as they both are now angels, an' friendly, as 'is nature\n'ad not developed in this valley of the shadder to determine 'is\nfeelin's towards is father when 'e died, bein' carried off by a chill,\ncaused by the change from 'ot to cold, the weather bein' that contrary.\"\n\nThey had arrived in Brian's sitting-room by this time, and Madge sank\ninto a chair, while Calton, anxious to begin the search, hinted to Mrs.\nSampson that she could go.\n\n\"I'm departin', sir,\" piped the cricket, with a sad shake of her head,\nas she opened the door; \"knowin', as I do, as 'e's as innocent as an\nunborn babe, an' to think of me 'avin' told that 'orrid pusson who 'ad\nno regard for the truth all about 'im as is now in a cold cell, not as\nwhat the weather ain't warm, an' 'e won't want a fire as long as they\nallows 'im blankets.\"\n\n\"What did you tell him?\" asked Calton, sharply.\n\n\"Ah! you may well say that,\" lamented Mrs. Sampson, rolling her dingy\nhandkerchief into a ball, and dabbing at her red-rimmed eyes, which\npresented quite a bacchanalian appearance, due, be it said in justice,\nto grief, not to liquor. \"'Avin' bin beguiled by that serping in light\nclothes as wanted to know if 'e allays come 'ome afore twelve, which I\nsaid 'e was in the 'abit of doin', tho', to be sure, 'e did sometimes\nuse 'is latch-key.\"\n\n\"The night of the murder, for instance.\"\n\n\"Oh! don't say that, sir,\" said Mrs. Sampson, with a terrified crackle.\n\"Me bein' weak an' ailin', tho' comin' of a strong family, as allays\nlived to a good age, thro' bein' in the 'abit of wearin' flannels,\nwhich my mother's father thought better nor a-spilin' the inside with\nchemistry.\"\n\n\"Clever man, that detective,\" murmured Calton to himself. \"He got out\nof her by strategy what he never would have done by force. It's a\nstrong piece of evidence against Fitzgerald, but it does not matter\nmuch if he can prove an ALIBI. You'll likely be called as a witness for\nthe prosecution,\" he said aloud.\n\n\"Me, sir!\" squeaked Mrs. Sampson, trembling violently, and thereby\nproducing a subdued rustle, as of wind in the trees. \"As I've never bin\nin the court, 'cept the time as father tooked me for a treat, to 'ear a\nmurder, which there's no denyin' is as good as a play, 'e bein' 'ung,\n'avin' 'it 'is wife over the 'ead with the poker when she weren't\nlookin', and a-berryin' 'er corpse in a back garding, without even a\nstone to mark the place, let alone a line from the Psalms and a\nremuneration of 'er virtues.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said Calton, rather impatiently, as he opened the door\nfor her, \"leave us for a short time, there's a good soul. Miss Frettlby\nand I want to rest, and we will ring for you when we are going.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said the lachrymose landlady, \"an' I 'opes they won't\n'ang 'im, which is sich a choky way of dyin'; but in life we are in\ndeath,\" she went on, rather incoherently, \"as is well known to them as\n'as diseases, an' may be corpsed at any minute, and as--\"\n\nHere Calton, unable to restrain his impatience any longer, shut the\ndoor, and they heard Mrs. Sampson's shrill voice and subdued cracklings\ndie away in the distance.\n\n\"Now then,\" he said, \"now that we have got rid of that woman and her\ntongue, where are we to begin?\"\n\n\"The desk,\" replied Madge, going over to it. \"It's the most likely\nplace.\"\n\n\"Don't think so,\" said Calton, shaking his head. \"If, as you say,\nFitzgerald is a careless man, he would not have troubled to put it\nthere. However; perhaps we'd better look.\"\n\nThe desk was very untidy (\"Just like Brian,\" as Madge remarked)--full\nof paid and unpaid bills, old letters, play-bills, ball-programmes, and\nwithered flowers.\n\n\"Reminiscences of former flirtations,\" said Calton, with a laugh,\npointing to these.\n\n\"I should not wonder,\" retorted Miss Frettlby, coolly. \"Brian always\nwas in love with some one or other; but you know what Lytton says,\n'There are many counterfeits, but only one Eros,' so I can afford to\nforget these things.\"\n\nThe letter, however, was not to be found in the desk, nor was it in the\nsitting-room. They tried the bedroom, but with no better result. Madge\nwas about to give up the search in despair, when suddenly Calton's eye\nfell on the waste-paper basket, which, by some unaccountable reason,\nthey had over-looked. The basket was half-full, in fact; more than\nhalf, and, on looking at it, a sudden thought struck the lawyer. He\nrang the bell, and presently Mrs. Sampson made her appearance.\n\n\"How long has that waste-paper basket been standing like that?\" he\nasked, pointing to it.\n\n\"It bein' the only fault I 'ad to find with 'im,\" said Mrs. Sampson,\n\"'e bein' that untidy that 'e a never let me clean it out until 'e told\nme pussonly. 'E said as 'ow 'e throwed things into it as 'e might 'ave\nto look up again; an' I 'aven't touched it for more nor six weeks,\n'opin' you won't think me a bad 'ousekeeper, it bein' 'is own\nwish--bein' fond of litter an' sich like.\"\n\n\"Six weeks,\" repeated Calton, with a look at Madge. \"Ah, and he got the\nletter four weeks ago. Depend upon it, we shall find it there.\"\n\nMadge gave a cry, and falling on her knees, emptied the basket out on\nthe floor, and both she and Calton were soon as busy among the\nfragments of paper as though they were rag-pickers.\n\n\"'Opin they ain't orf their 'eads,\" murmured Mrs. Sampson, as she went\nto the door, \"but it looks like it, they bein'--\"\n\nSuddenly a cry broke from Madge, as she drew out of the mass of paper a\nhalf-burnt letter, written on thick and creamy-looking paper.\n\n\"At last,\" she cried, rising off her knees, and smoothing it out; \"I\nknew he had not destroyed it.\"\n\n\"Pretty nearly, however,\" said Calton, as his eye glanced rapidly over\nit; \"it's almost useless as it is. There's no name to it.\"\n\n[Illustration: Fac-simile of the letter]\n\nHe took it over to the window, and spread it out upon the table. It was\ndirty, and half burnt, but still it was a clue. The above is a FAC-SIMILE of\nthe letter:--\n\n\"There is not much to be gained from that, I'm afraid,\" said Madge,\nsadly. \"It shows that he had an appointment--but where?\"\n\nCalton did not answer, but, leaning his head on his hands, stared hard\nat the paper. At last he jumped up with a cry--\n\n\"I have it,\" he said, in an excited tone. \"Look at that paper; see how\ncreamy and white it is, and above all, look at the printing in the\ncorner--'OT VILLA, TOORAK.'\"\n\n\"Then he went down to Toorak?\"\n\n\"In an hour, and back again--hardly!\"\n\n\"Then it was not written from Toorak?\"\n\n\"No, it was written in one of the Melbourne back slums.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"Look at the girl who brought it,\" said Calton, quickly. \"A\ndisreputable woman, one far more likely to come from the back slums\nthan from Toorak. As to the paper, three months ago there was a robbery\nat Toorak, and this is some of the paper that was stolen by the\nthieves.\"\n\nMadge said nothing, but her sparkling eyes and the nervous trembling of\nher hands showed her excitement.\n\n\"I will see a detective this evening,\" said Calton, exultingly, \"find\nout where this letter came from, and who wrote it. We'll save him yet,\"\nhe said, placing the precious letter carefully in his pocket-book.\n\n\"You think that you will be able to find the woman who wrote that?\"\n\n\"Hum,\" said the lawyer, looking thoughtful, \"she may be dead, as the\nletter says she is in a dying condition. However, if I can find the\nwoman who delivered the letter at the Club, and who waited for\nFitzgerald at the corner of Bourke and Russell Streets, that will be\nsufficient. All I want to prove is that he was not in the hansom cab\nwith Whyte.\"\n\n\"And do you think you can do that?\"\n\n\"Depends upon this letter,\" said Calton, tapping his pocket-book with\nhis finger. \"I'll tell you to-morrow.\"\n\nShortly afterwards they left the house, and when Calton put Madge\nsafely into the St. Kilda train, her heart felt lighter than it had\ndone since Fitzgerald's arrest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nANOTHER RICHMOND IN THE FIELD.\n\n\nThere is an old adage that says \"Like draws to like.\" The antithesis of\nthis is probably that \"Unlike repels unlike.\" But there are times when\nindividualism does not enter into the matter, and Fate alone, by\nthrowing two persons together, sets up a state, congenial or\nuncongenial, as the case may be. Fate chose to throw together Mr. Gorby\nand Mr. Kilsip, and each was something more than uncongenial to the\nother. Each was equally clever in their common profession; each was a\nuniversal favourite, yet each hated the other. They were as fire and\nwater to one another, and when they came together, invariably there was\ntrouble.\n\nKilsip was tall and slender; Gorby was short and stout. Kilsip looked\nclever; Gorby wore a smile of self-satisfaction; which alone was\nsufficient to prevent his doing so. Yet, singularly enough, it was this\nvery smile that proved most useful to Gorby in the pursuit of his\ncalling. It enabled him to come at information where his sharp-looking\ncolleague might try in vain. The hearts of all went forth to Gorby's\nsweet smile and insinuating manner. But when Kilsip appeared people\nwere wont to shut up, and to retire promptly, like alarmed snails,\nwithin their shells. Gorby gave the lie direct to those who hold that\nthe face is ever the index to the mind. Kilsip, on the other hand, with\nhis hawk-like countenance, his brilliant black eyes, hooked nose, and\nsmall thin-lipped mouth, endorsed the theory. His complexion was quite\ncolourless, and his hair was jet black. Altogether, he could not be\ncalled fair to look upon. His craft and cunning were of the snake-like\norder. So long as he conducted his enquiries in secret he was generally\nsuccessful; but once let him appear personally on the scene, and\nfailure was assured to him. Thus, while Kilsip passed as the cleverer,\nGorby was invariably the more successful--at all events, ostensibly.\n\nWhen, therefore, this hansom cab murder case was put into Gorby's\nhands, the soul of Kilsip was smitten with envy, and when Fitzgerald\nwas arrested, and all the evidence collected by Gorby seemed to point\nso conclusively to his guilt, Kilsip writhed in secret over the triumph\nof his enemy. Though he would only have been too glad to say that Gorby\nhad got hold of the wrong man, yet the evidence was so conclusive that\nsuch a thought never entered his head until he received a note from Mr.\nCalton, asking him to call at his office that evening at eight o'clock,\nwith reference to the murder.\n\nKilsip knew that Calton was counsel for the prisoner. He guessed that\nhe was wanted to follow up a clue. And he determined to devote himself\nto whatever Calton might require of him, if only to prove Gorby to be\nwrong. So pleased was he at the mere possibility of triumphing over his\nrival, that on casually meeting him, he stopped and invited him to\ndrink.\n\nThe primary effect of his sudden and unusual hospitality was to arouse\nall Gorby's suspicions; but on second thoughts, deeming himself quite a\nmatch for Kilsip, both mentally and physically, Gorby accepted the\ninvitation.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Kilsip, in his soft, low voice, rubbing his lean white hands\ntogether, as they sat over their drinks, \"you're a lucky man to have\nlaid your hands on that hansom cab murderer so quickly.\"\n\n\"Yes; I flatter myself I did manage it pretty well,\" said Gorby,\nlighting his pipe. \"I had no idea that it would be so simple--though,\nmind you, it required a lot of thought before I got a proper start.\"\n\n\"I suppose you're pretty sure he's the man you want?\" pursued Kilsip,\nsoftly, with a brilliant flash of his black eyes.\n\n\"Pretty sure, indeed!\" retorted Mr. Gorby, scornfully, \"there ain't no\npretty sure about it. I'd take my Bible oath he's the man. He and Whyte\nhated one another. He says to Whyte, 'I'll kill you, if I've got to do\nit in the open street.' He meets Whyte drunk, a fact which he\nacknowledges himself; he clears out, and the cabman swears he comes\nback; then he gets into the cab with a living man, and when he comes\nout leaves a dead one; he drives to East Melbourne and gets into the\nhouse at a time which his landlady can prove--just the time that a cab\nwould take to drive from the Grammar School on the St. Kilda Road. If\nyou ain't a fool, Kilsip, you'll see as there's no doubt about it.\"\n\n\"It looks all square enough,\" said Kilsip, who wondered what evidence\nCalton could have found to contradict such a plain statement of fact.\n\"And what's his defence?\"\n\n\"Mr. Calton's the only man as knows that,\" answered Gorby, finishing\nhis drink; \"but, clever and all as he is, he can't put anything in,\nthat can go against my evidence.\"\n\n\"Don't you be too sure of that,\" sneered Kilsip, whose soul was\ndevoured with envy.\n\n\"Oh! but I am,\" retorted Gorby, getting as red as a turkey-cock at the\nsneer. \"You're jealous, you are, because you haven't got a finger in\nthe pie.\"\n\n\"Ah! but I may have yet.\"\n\n\"Going a-hunting yourself, are you?\" said Gorby, with an indignant\nsnort. \"A-hunting for what--for a man as is already caught?\"\n\n\"I don't believe you've got the right man,\" remarked Kilsip,\ndeliberately.\n\nMr. Gorby looked upon him with a smile of pity.\n\n\"No! of course you don't, just because I've caught him; perhaps, when\nyou see him hanged, you'll believe it then?\"\n\n\"You're a smart man, you are,\" retorted Kilsip; \"but you ain't the Pope\nto be infallible.\"\n\n\"And what grounds have you for saying he's not the right man?\" demanded\nGorby.\n\nKilsip smiled, and stole softly across the room like a cat.\n\n\"You don't think I'm such a fool as to tell you? But you ain't so safe\nnor clever as you think,\" and, with another irritating smile, he went\nout.\n\n\"He's a regular snake,\" said Gorby to himself, as the door closed on\nhis brother detective; \"but he's bragging now. There isn't a link\nmissing in the chain of evidence against Fitzgerald, so I defy him. He\ncan do his worst.\"\n\nAt eight o'clock on that night the soft-footed and soft-voiced\ndetective presented himself at Calton's office. He found the lawyer\nimpatiently waiting for him. Kilsip closed the door softly, and then\ntaking a seat opposite to Calton, waited for him to speak. The lawyer,\nhowever, first handed him a cigar, and then producing a bottle of\nwhisky and two glasses from some mysterious recess, he filled one and\npushed it towards the detective. Kilsip accepted these little\nattentions with the utmost gravity, yet they were not without their\neffect on him, as the keen-eyed lawyer saw. Calton was a great believer\nin diplomacy, and never lost an opportunity of inculcating it into\nyoung men starting in life. \"Diplomacy,\" said Calton, to one young\naspirant for legal honours, \"is the oil we cast on the troubled waters\nof social, professional, and political life; and if you can, by a\nlittle tact, manage mankind, you are pretty certain to get on in this\nworld.\"\n\nCalton was a man who practised what he preached. He believed Kilsip to\nhave that feline nature, which likes to be stroked, to be made much of,\nand he paid him these little attentions, knowing full well they would\nbear their fruit. He also knew that Kilsip entertained no friendly\nfeeling for Gorby, that, in fact, he bore him hatred, and he determined\nthat this feeling which existed between the two men, should serve him\nto the end he had in view.\n\n\"I suppose,\" he said, leaning back in his chair, and watching the\nwreaths of blue smoke curling from his cigar, \"I suppose you know all\nthe ins and the outs of the hansom cab murder?\"\n\n\"I should rather think so,\" said Kilsip, with a curious light in his\nqueer eyes. \"Why, Gorby does nothing but brag about it, and his\nsmartness in catching the supposed murderer!\"\n\n\"Aha!\" said Calton, leaning forward, and putting his arms on the table.\n\"Supposed murderer. Eh! Does that mean that he hasn't been convicted by\na jury, or that you think that Fitzgerald is innocent?\"\n\nKilsip stared hard at the lawyer, in a vague kind of way, slowly\nrubbing his hands together.\n\n\"Well,\" he said at length, in a deliberate manner, \"before I got your\nnote, I was convinced Gorby had got hold of the right man, but when I\nheard that you wanted to see me, and knowing you are defending the\nprisoner, I guessed that you must have found something in his favour\nwhich you wanted me to look after.\"\n\n\"Right!\" said Calton, laconically.\n\n\"As Mr. Fitzgerald said he met Whyte at the corner and hailed the\ncab--\" went on the detective.\n\n\"How do you know that?\" interrupted Calton, sharply.\n\n\"Gorby told me.\"\n\n\"How the devil did he find out?\" cried the lawyer, with genuine\nsurprise.\n\n\"Because he is always poking and prying about,\" said Kilsip,\nforgetting, in his indignation, that such poking and prying formed part\nof detective business. \"But, at any rate,\" he went on quickly, \"if Mr.\nFitzgerald did leave Mr. Whyte, the only chance he's got of proving his\ninnocence is that he did not come back, as the cabman alleged.\"\n\n\"Then, I suppose, you think that Fitzgerald will prove an ALIBI,\" said\nCalton.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" answered Kilsip, modestly, \"of course you know more about\nthe case than I do, but that is the only defence I can see he can make.\"\n\n\"Well, he's not going to put in such a defence.\"\n\n\"Then he must be guilty,\" said Kilsip, promptly.\n\n\"Not necessarily,\" returned the barrister, drily.\n\n\"But if he wants to save his neck, he'll have to prove an ALIBI,\"\npersisted the other.\n\n\"That's just where the point is,\" answered Calton. \"He doesn't want to\nsave his neck.\"\n\nKilsip, looking rather bewildered, took a sip of whisky, and waited to\nhear what Mr. Calton had to say.\n\n\"The fact is,\" said Calton, lighting a fresh cigar, \"he has some\nextraordinary idea in his head. He refuses absolutely to say where he\nwas on that night.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Kilsip, nodding his head. \"Woman?\"\n\n\"No, nothing of the kind,\" retorted Calton, hastily. \"I thought so at\nfirst, but I was wrong. He went to see a dying woman, who wished to\ntell him something.\"\n\n\"What about?\"\n\n\"That's just what I can't tell you,\" answered Calton quickly. \"It must\nhave been something important, for she sent for him in great haste--and\nhe was by her bedside between the hours of one and two on Friday\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Then he did not return to the cab?\"\n\n\"No, he did not, he went to keep his appointment, but, for some reason\nor other, he won't tell where this appointment was. I went to his rooms\nto-day and found this half-burnt letter, asking him to come.\"\n\nCalton handed the letter to Kilsip, who placed it on the table and\nexamined it carefully.\n\n\"This was written on Thursday,\" said the detective.\n\n\"Of course--you can see that from the date; and Whyte was murdered on\nFriday, the 27th.\"\n\n\"It was written at something Villa, Toorak,\" pursued Kilsip, still\nexamining the paper. \"Oh! I understand; he went down there.\"\n\n\"Hardly,\" retorted Calton, in a sarcastic tone. \"He couldn't very well\ngo down there, have an interview, and be back in East Melbourne in one\nhour--the cabman Royston can prove that he was at Russell Street at one\no'clock, and his landlady that he entered his lodging in East Melbourne\nat two--no, he wasn't at Toorak.\"\n\n\"When was this letter delivered?\"\n\n\"Shortly before twelve o'clock, at the Melbourne Club, by a girl, who,\nfrom what the waiter saw of her, appears to be a disreputable\nindividual--you will see it says bearer will wait him at Bourke Street,\nand as another street is mentioned, and as Fitzgerald, after leaving\nWhyte, went down Russell Street to keep his appointment, the most\nlogical conclusion is that the bearer of the letter waited for him at\nthe corner of Bourke and Russell Streets. Now,\" went on the lawyer, \"I\nwant to find out who the girl that brought the letter is!\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"God bless my soul, Kilsip! How stupid you are,\" cried Calton, his\nirritation getting the better of him. \"Can't you understand--that paper\ncame from one of the back slums--therefore it must have been stolen.\"\n\nA sudden light flashed into Kilsip's eyes.\n\n\"Talbot Villa, Toorak,\" he cried quickly, snatching up the letter\nagain, and examining it with great attention, \"where that burglary took\nplace.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Calton, smiling complacently. \"Now do you understand\nwhat I want--you must take me to the crib in the back slums where the\narticles stolen from the house in Toorak were hidden. This\npaper\"--pointing to the letter--\"is part of the swag left behind, and\nmust have been used by someone there. Brian Fitzgerald obeyed the\ndirections given in the letter, and he was there, at the time of the\nmurder.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Kilsip, with a gratified purr. \"There were four\nmen engaged in that burglary, and they hid the swag at Mother\nGuttersnipe's crib, in a lane off Little Bourke Street--but hang it, a\nswell like Mr. Fitzgerald, in evening dress, couldn't very well have\ngone down there unless--\"\n\n\"He had some one with him well-known in the locality,\" finished Calton,\nrapidly. \"Exactly, that woman who delivered the letter at the Club\nguided him. Judging from the waiter's description of her appearance, I\nshould think she was pretty well known about the slums.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Kilsip, rising and looking at his watch, \"it is now nine\no'clock, so if you like we will go to the old hag's place at\nonce--dying woman,\" he said, as if struck by a sudden thought, \"there\nwas a woman who died there about four weeks ago.\"\n\n\"Who was she?\" asked Calton, who was putting on his overcoat.\n\n\"Some relation of Mother Guttersnipe's, I fancy,\" answered Kilsip, as\nthey left the office. \"I don't know exactly what she was--she was\ncalled the 'Queen,' and a precious handsome woman she must have\nbeen--came from Sydney about three months ago, and from what I can make\nout, was not long from England, died of consumption on the Thursday\nnight before the murder.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nA WOMAN OF THE PEOPLE.\n\n\nBourke Street is a more crowded thoroughfare than Collins Street,\nespecially at night. The theatres that it contains are in themselves\nsufficient for the gathering of a considerable crowd. It is a grimy\ncrowd for the most part. Round the doors of the hotels a number of\nragged and shabby-looking individuals collect, waiting till some kind\nfriend shall invite them to step inside. Further on a knot of\nhorsey-looking men are to be seen standing under the Opera House\nverandah giving and taking odds about the Melbourne Cup, or some other\nmeeting. Here and there are ragged street Arabs, selling matches and\nnewspapers; and against the verandah post, in the full blaze of the\nelectric light, leans a weary, draggled-looking woman, one arm clasping\na baby to her breast, and the other holding a pile of newspapers, while\nshe drones out in a hoarse voice, \"'ERALD, third 'dition, one penny!\"\nuntil the ear wearies of the constant repetition. Cabs rattle\nincessantly along the street; here, a fast-looking hansom, with a\nrakish horse, bearing some gilded youth to his Club--there, a\ndingy-looking vehicle, drawn by a lank quadruped, which staggers\nblindly down the street. Alternating with these, carriages dash along\nwith their well-groomed horses, and within, the vision of bright eyes,\nwhite dresses, and the sparkle of diamonds. Then, further up, just on\nthe verge of the pavement, three violins and a harp are playing a\nGerman waltz to an admiring crowd of attentive spectators. If there is\none thing which the Melbourne folk love more than another, it is music.\nTheir fondness for it is only equalled by their admiration for\nhorse-racing. Any street band which plays at all decently, may be sure\nof a good audience, and a substantial remuneration for their\nperformance. Some writer has described Melbourne, as Glasgow with the\nsky of Alexandria; and certainly the beautiful climate of Australia, so\nItalian in its brightness, must have a great effect on the nature of\nsuch an adaptable race as the Anglo-Saxon. In spite of the dismal\nprognostications of Marcus Clarke regarding the future Australian, whom\nhe describes as being \"a tall, coarse, strong-jawed, greedy, pushing,\ntalented man, excelling in swimming and horsemanship,\" it is more\nlikely that he will be a cultured, indolent individual, with an intense\nappreciation of the arts and sciences, and a dislike to hard work and\nutilitarian principles. Climatic influence should be taken into account\nwith regard to the future Australian, and our posterity will no more\nresemble us than the luxurious Venetians resembled their hardy\nforefathers, who first started to build on those lonely sandy islands\nof the Adriatic.\n\nThis was the conclusion at which Mr. Calton arrived as he followed his\nguide through the crowded streets, and saw with what deep interest the\ncrowd listened to the rhythmic strains of Strauss and the sparkling\nmelodies of Offenbach. The brilliantly-lit street, with the\nnever-ceasing stream of people pouring along; the shrill cries of the\nstreet Arabs, the rattle of vehicles, and the fitful strains of music,\nall made up a scene which fascinated him, and he could have gone on\nwandering all night, watching the myriad phases of human character\nconstantly passing before his eyes. But his guide, with whom\nfamiliarity with the proletarians had, in a great measure, bred\nindifference, hurried him away to Little Bourke Street, where the\nnarrowness of the thoroughfare, with the high buildings on each side,\nthe dim light of the sparsely scattered gas-lamps, and the few\nragged-looking figures slouching along, formed a strong contrast to the\nbrilliant and crowded scene they had just left. Turning off Little\nBourke Street, the detective led the way down a dark lane. It was as\nhot as a furnace from the accumulated heat of the day. To look up at\nthe clear starlit sky was to experience a sensation of delicious\ncoolness.\n\n\"Keep close to me,\" whispered Kilsip, touching the barrister on the\narm; \"we may meet some nasty customers about here.\"\n\nIt was not quite dark, for the atmosphere had that luminous kind of\nhaze so observable in Australian twilights, and this weird light was\njust sufficient to make the darkness visible. Kilsip and the barrister\nkept for safety in the middle of the alley, so that no one could spring\nupon them unaware, and they could see sometimes on the one side, a man\ncowering back into the black shadow, or on the other, a woman with\ndisordered hair and bare bosom, leaning out of a window trying to get a\nbreath of fresh air. There were also some children playing in the\ndried-up gutter, and their shrill young voices came echoing strangely\nthrough the gloom, mingling with a bacchanalian sort of song, sung by a\nman, as he slouched along unsteadily over the rough stones. Now and\nthen a mild-looking string of Chinamen stole along, clad in their\ndull-hued blue blouses, either chattering shrilly, like a lot of\nparrots, or moving silently down the alley with a stolid Oriental\napathy on their yellow faces. Here and there came a stream of warm\nlight through an open door, and within, the Mongolians were gathered\nround the gambling-tables, playing fan-tan, or leaving the seductions\nof their favourite pastime, to glide soft-footed to the many\ncook-shops, where enticing-looking fowls and turkeys already cooked\nwere awaiting purchasers. Kilsip turning to the left, led the barrister\ndown another and still narrower lane, the darkness and gloom of which\nmade the lawyer shudder, as he wondered how human beings could live in\nsuch murky places.\n\nAt last, to Calton's relief, for he felt somewhat bewildered by the\ndarkness and narrowness of the lanes through which he had been taken,\nthe detective stopped before a door, which he opened, and stepping\ninside, beckoned to the barrister to follow. Calton did so, and found\nhimself in a low, dark, ill-smelling passage. At the end a faint light\nglimmered. Kilsip caught his companion by the arm and guided him\ncarefully along the passage. There was much need of this caution, for\nCalton could feel that the rotten boards were full of holes, into which\none or the other of his feet kept slipping from time to time, while he\ncould hear the rats squeaking and scampering away on all sides. Just as\nthey got to the end of this tunnel, for it could be called nothing\nelse, the light suddenly went out, and they were left in complete\ndarkness.\n\n\"Light that,\" cried the detective in a peremptory tone of voice. \"What\ndo you mean by dowsing the glim?\"\n\nThieves' argot was, evidently, well understood here, for there was a\nshuffle in the dark, a muttered voice, and someone lit a candle. Calton\nsaw that the light was held by an elfish-looking child. Tangled masses\nof black hair hung over her scowling white face. As she crouched down\non the floor against the damp wall she looked up defiantly yet\nfearfully at the detective.\n\n\"Where's Mother Guttersnipe?\" asked Kilsip, touching her with his foot.\n\nShe seemed to resent the indignity, and rose quickly to her feet.\n\n\"Upstairs,\" she replied, jerking her head in the direction of the right\nwall.\n\nFollowing her direction, Calton--his eyes now somewhat accustomed to\nthe gloom--could discern a gaping black chasm, which he presumed was\nthe stair alluded to.\n\n\"Yer won't get much out of 'er to-night; she's a-going to start 'er\nbooze, she is.\"\n\n\"Never mind what she's doing or about to do,\" said Kilsip, sharply,\n\"take me to her at once.\"\n\nThe girl looked him sullenly up and down, then she led the way into the\nblack chasm and up the stairs. They were so shaky as to make Calton\nfear they might give way. As they toiled slowly up the broken steps he\nheld tightly to his companion's arm. At last they stopped at a door\nthrough the cracks of which a faint glimmer of light was to be seen.\nHere the girl gave a shrill whistle, and the door opened. Still\npreceded by their elfish guide, Calton and the detective stepped\nthrough the doorway. A curious scene was before them. A small square\nroom, with a low roof, from which the paper mildewed and torn hung in\nshreds; on the left hand, at the far end, was a kind of low stretcher,\nupon which a woman, almost naked, lay, amid a heap of greasy clothes.\nShe appeared to be ill, for she kept tossing her head from side to side\nrestlessly, and every now and then sang snatches of song in a cracked\nvoice. In the centre of the room was a rough deal table, upon which\nstood a guttering tallow candle, which but faintly illuminated the\nscene, and a half empty rectangular bottle of Schnapps, with a broken\ncup beside it. In front of these signs of festivity sat an old woman\nwith a pack of cards spread out before her, and from which she had\nevidently been telling the fortune of a villainous-looking young man\nwho had opened the door, and who stood looking at the detective with no\nvery friendly expression of countenance. He wore a greasy brown velvet\ncoat, much patched, and a black wide-awake hat, pulled down over his\neyes. From his expression--so scowling and vindictive was it--the\nbarrister judged his ultimate destiny to lie between Pentridge and the\ngallows.\n\nAs they entered, the fortune-teller raised her head, and, shading her\neyes with one skinny hand, looked curiously at the new comers. Calton\nthought he had never seen such a repulsive-looking old crone; and, in\ntruth, her ugliness was, in its very grotesqueness well worthy the\npencil of a Dore. Her face was seamed and lined with innumerable\nwrinkles, clearly defined by the dirt which was in them; bushy grey\neyebrows, drawn frowningly over two piercing black eyes, whose light\nwas undimmed by age; a hook nose, like the beak of a bird of prey, and\na thin-lipped mouth devoid of teeth. Her hair was very luxurious and\nalmost white, and was tied up in a great bunch by a greasy bit of black\nribbon. As to her chin, Calton, when he saw it wagging to and fro,\ninvoluntarily quoted Macbeth's lines--\n\n  \"Ye should be women,\n  And yet your beards forbid me to interpret\n  That ye are so.\"\n\n\nShe was no bad representative of the weird sisters.\n\nAs they entered she eyed them viciously, demanding,\n\n\"What the blazes they wanted.\"\n\n\"Want your booze,\" cried the child, with an elfish laugh, as she shook\nback her tangled hair.\n\n\"Get out, you whelp,\" croaked the old hag, shaking one skinny fist at\nher, \"or I'll tear yer 'eart out.\"\n\n\"Yes, she can go.\" said Kilsip, nodding to the girl, \"and you can\nclear, too,\" he added, sharply, turning to the young man, who stood\nstill holding the door open.\n\nAt first he seemed inclined to dispute the detective's order, but\nultimately obeyed him, muttering, as he went out, something about \"the\nblooming cheek of showin' swells cove's cribs.\" The child followed him\nout, her exit being accelerated by Mother Guttersnipe, who, with a\nrapidity only attained by long practice, seized the shoe from one of\nher feet, and flung it at the head of the rapidly retreating girl.\n\n\"Wait till I ketches yer, Lizer,\" she shrieked, with a volley of oaths,\n\"I'll break yer 'ead for ye!\"\n\nLizer responded with a shrill laugh of disdain, and vanished through\nthe shaky door, which she closed after her.\n\nWhen she had disappeared Mother Guttersnipe took a drink from the\nbroken cup, and, gathering all her greasy cards together in a\nbusiness-like way, looked insinuatingly at Calton, with a suggestive\nleer.\n\n\"It's the future ye want unveiled, dearie?\" she croaked, rapidly\nshuffling the cards; \"an' old mother 'ull tell--\"\n\n\"No she won't,\" interrupted the detective, sharply. \"I've come on\nbusiness.\"\n\nThe old woman started at this, and looked keenly at him from under her\nbushy eyebrows.\n\n\"What 'av the boys been up to now?\" she asked, harshly. \"There ain't no\nswag 'ere this time.\"\n\nJust then the sick woman, who had been restlessly tossing on the bed,\ncommenced singing a snatch of the quaint old ballad of \"Barbara Allen\"--\n\n  \"Oh, mither, mither, mak' my bed,\n  An' mak' it saft an' narrow;\n  Since my true love died for me to-day\n  I'll die for him to-morrow.\"\n\n\n\"Shut up, cuss you!\" yelled Mother Guttersnipe, viciously, \"or I'll\nknock yer bloomin' 'ead orf,\" and she seized the square bottle as if to\ncarry out her threat; but, altering her mind, she poured some of its\ncontents into the cup, and drank it off with avidity.\n\n\"The woman seems ill,\" said Calton, casting a shuddering glance at the\nstretcher.\n\n\"So she are,\" growled Mother Guttersnipe, angrily. \"She ought to be in\nYarrer Bend, she ought, instead of stoppin' 'ere an' singin' them\nbeastly things, which makes my blood run cold. Just 'ear 'er,\" she\nsaid, viciously, as the sick woman broke out once more--\n\n  \"Oh, little did my mither think,\n  When first she cradled me,\n  I'd die sa far away fra home,\n  Upon the gallows tree.\"\n\n\n\"Yah!\" said the old woman, hastily, drinking some more gin out of the\ncup. \"She's allays a-talkin' of dyin' an' gallers, as if they were nice\nthings to jawr about.\"\n\n\"Who was that woman who died here three or four weeks ago?\" asked\nKilsip, sharply.\n\n\"'Ow should I know?\" retorted Mother Guttersnipe, sullenly. \"I didn't\nkill 'er, did I? It were the brandy she drank; she was allays drinkin',\ncuss her.\"\n\n\"Do you remember the night she died?\"\n\n\"No, I don't,\" answered the beldame, frankly. \"I were drunk--blind,\nbloomin', blazin' drunk--s'elp me.\"\n\n\"You're always drunk,\" said Kilsip.\n\n\"What if I am?\" snarled the woman, seizing her bottle. \"You don't pay\nfur it. Yes, I'm drunk. I'm allays drunk. I was drunk last night, an'\nthe night before, an' I'm a-goin' to git drunk to-night\"--with an\nimpressive look at the bottle--\"an' to-morrow night, an' I'll keep it\nup till I'm rottin' in the grave.\"\n\nCalton shuddered, so full of hatred and suppressed malignity was her\nvoice, but the detective merely shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"More fool you,\" he said, briefly. \"Come now, on the night the 'Queen,'\nas you call her, died, there was a gentleman came to see her?\"\n\n\"So she said,\" retorted Mother Guttersnipe; \"but, lor, I dunno\nanythin', I were drunk.\"\n\n\"Who said--the 'Queen?'\"\n\n\"No, my gran'darter, Sal. The 'Queen,' sent 'er to fetch the toff to\nsee 'er cut 'er lucky. Wanted 'im to look at 'is work, I s'pose, cuss\n'im; and Sal prigged some paper from my box,\" she shrieked,\nindignantly; \"prigged it w'en I were too drunk to stop 'er?\"\n\nThe detective glanced at Calton, who nodded to him with a gratified\nexpression on his face. They were right as to the paper having been\nstolen from the Villa at Toorak.\n\n\"You did not see the gentleman who came?\" said Kilsip, turning again to\nthe old hag.\n\n\"Not I, cuss you,\" she retorted, politely. \"'E came about 'arf-past one\nin the morning, an' you don't expects we can stop up all night, do ye?\"\n\n\"Half-past one o'clock,\" repeated Calton, quickly. \"The very time. Is\nthis true?\"\n\n\"Wish I may die if it ain't,\" said Mother Guttersnipe, graciously. \"My\ngran'darter Sal kin tell ye.\"\n\n\"Where is she?\" asked Kilsip, sharply.\n\nAt this the old woman threw back her head, and howled dismay.\n\n\"She's 'ooked it,\" she wailed, drumming on the ground with her feet.\n\"Gon' an' left 'er pore old gran' an' joined the Army, cuss 'em,\na-comin' round an' a-spilin' business.\"\n\nHere the woman on the bed broke out again--\n\n  \"Since the flowers o' the forest are a' wed awa.\"\n\n\n\"'Old yer jawr,\" yelled Mother Guttersnipe, rising, and making a dart\nat the bed. \"I'll choke the life out ye, s'elp me. D'y want me to\nmurder ye, singin' 'em funeral things?\"\n\nMeanwhile the detective was talking rapidly to Mr. Calton.\n\n\"The only person who can prove Mr. Fitzgerald was here between one and\ntwo o'clock,\" he said, quickly, \"is Sal Rawlins, as everyone else seems\nto have been drunk or asleep. As she has joined the Salvation Army,\nI'll go to the barracks the first thing in the morning and look for\nher.\"\n\n\"I hope you'll find her,\" answered Calton, drawing a long breath. \"A\nman's life hangs on her evidence.\"\n\nThey turned to go, Calton having first given Mother Guttersnipe some\nloose silver, which she seized on with an avaricious clutch.\n\n\"You'll drink it, I suppose?\" said the barrister, shrinking back from\nher.\n\n\"Werry likely,\" retorted the hag, with a repulsive grin, tying the\nmoney up in a piece of her dress, which she tore off for the purpose.\n\"I'm a forting to the public-'ouse, I am, an' it's the on'y pleasure I\n'ave in my life, cuss it.\"\n\nThe sight of money had a genial effect on her nature, for she held the\ncandle at the head of the stairs, as they went down, so that they\nshould not break their heads. As they arrived safely, they saw the\nlight vanish, and heard the sick woman singing, \"The Last Rose of\nSummer.\"\n\nThe street door was open, and, after groping their way along the dark\npassage, with its pitfalls, they found themselves in the open street.\n\n\"Thank heaven,\" said Calton, taking off his hat, and drawing a long\nbreath. \"Thank heaven we are safely out of that den!\"\n\n\"At all events, our journey has not been wasted,\" said the detective,\nas they walked along. \"We've found out where Mr. Fitzgerald was on the\nnight of the murder, so he will be safe.\"\n\n\"That depends upon Sal Rawlins,\" answered Calton, gravely; \"but come,\nlet us have a glass of brandy, for I feel quite ill after my experience\nof low life.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nMISSING.\n\n\nThe next day Kilsip called at Calton's office late in the afternoon,\nand found the lawyer eagerly expecting him. The detective's face,\nhowever, looked rather dismal, and Calton was not reassured.\n\n\"Well!\" he said, impatiently, when Kilsip had closed the door and taken\nhis seat. \"Where is she?\"\n\n\"That's just what I want to know,\" answered the detective, coolly; \"I\nwent to the Salvation Army head-quarters and made enquiries about her.\nIt appears that she had been in the Army as a hallelujah lass, but got\ntired of it in a week, and went off with a friend of hers to Sydney.\nShe carried on her old life of dissipation, but, ultimately, her friend\ngot sick of her, and the last thing they heard about her was that she\nhad taken up with a Chinaman in one of the Sydney slums. I telegraphed\nat once to Sydney, and got a reply that there was no person of the name\nof Sal Rawlins known to the Sydney police, but they said they would\nmake enquiries, and let me know the result.\"\n\n\"Ah! she has, no doubt, changed her name,\" said Calton, thoughtfully,\nstroking his chin. \"I wonder why?\"\n\n\"Wanted to get rid of the Army, I expect,\" answered Kilsip, drily. \"The\nstraying lamb did not care about being hunted back to the fold.\"\n\n\"And when did she join the Army?\"\n\n\"The very day after the murder.\"\n\n\"Rather sudden conversion?\"\n\n\"Yes, but she said the death of the woman on Thursday night had so\nstartled her, that she went straight off to the Army to get her\nreligion properly fixed up.\"\n\n\"The effects of fright, no doubt,\" said Calton, dryly. \"I've met a good\nmany examples of these sudden conversions, but they never last long as\na rule--it's a case of 'the devil was sick, the devil a monk would be,'\nmore than anything else. Good-looking?\"\n\n\"So-so, I believe,\" replied Kilsip, shrugging his shoulders.\n\n\"Very ignorant--could neither read nor write.\"\n\n\"That accounts for her not asking for Fitzgerald when she called at the\nClub--she probably did not know whom she had been sent for. It will\nresolve itself into a question of identification, I expect. However, if\nthe police can't find her, we will put an advertisement in the papers\noffering a reward, and send out handbills to the same effect. She must\nbe found. Brian Fitzgerald's life hangs on a thread, and that thread is\nSal Rawlins.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" assented Kilsip, rubbing his hands together. \"Even if Mr.\nFitzgerald acknowledges that he was at Mother Guttersnipe's on the\nnight in question, she will have to prove that he was there, as no one\nelse saw him.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of that?\"\n\n\"As sure as anyone can be in such a case. It was a late hour when he\ncame, and everyone seems to have been asleep except the dying woman and\nSal; and as one is dead, the other is the only person that can prove\nthat he was there at the time when the murder was being committed in\nthe hansom.\"\n\n\"And Mother Guttersnipe?\"\n\n\"Was drunk, as she acknowledged last night. She thought that if a\ngentleman did call it must have been the other one.\"\n\n\"The other one?\" repeated Calton, in a puzzled voice. \"What other one?\"\n\n\"Oliver Whyte.\"\n\nCalton arose from his seat with a blank air of astonishment.\n\n\"Oliver Whyte!\" he said, as soon as he could find his voice. \"Was he in\nthe habit of going there?\"\n\nKilsip curled himself up in his seat like a sleek cat, and pushing\nforward his head till his nose looked like the beak of a bird of prey,\nlooked keenly at Calton.\n\n\"Look here, sir,\" he said, in his low, purring voice, \"there's a good\ndeal in this case which don't seem plain--in fact, the further we go\ninto it,--the more mixed up it seems to get. I went to see Mother\nGuttersnipe this morning, and she told me that Whyte had visited the\n'Queen' several times while she lay ill, and that he seemed to be\npretty well acquainted with her.\"\n\n\"But who the deuce is this woman they call the 'Queen'?\" said Calton,\nirritably. \"She seems to be at the bottom of the whole affair--every\npath we take leads to her.\"\n\n\"I know hardly anything about her,\" replied Kilsip, \"except that she\nwas a good-looking woman, of about forty-nine--she come out from\nEngland to Sydney a few months ago, then on here--how she got to Mother\nGuttersnipe's I can't find out, though I've tried to pump that old\nwoman, but she's as close as wax, and it's my belief she knows more\nabout this dead woman than she chooses to tell.\"\n\n\"But what could she have told Fitzgerald to make him act in this silly\nmanner? A stranger who comes from England, and dies in a Melbourne\nslum, can't possibly know anything about Miss Frettlby.\"\n\n\"Not unless Miss Frettlby was secretly married to Whyte,\" suggested\nKilsip, \"and the 'Queen' knew it.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" retorted Calton, sharply. \"Why, she hated him and loves\nFitzgerald; besides, why on earth should she marry secretly, and make a\nconfidant of a woman in one of the lowest parts of Melbourne? At one\ntime her father wanted her to marry Whyte, but she made such strong\nopposition, that he eventually gave his consent to her engagement with\nFitzgerald.\"\n\n\"And Whyte?\"\n\n\"Oh, he had a row with Mr. Frettlby, and left the house in a rage. He\nwas murdered the same night, for the sake of some papers he carried.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's Gorby's idea,\" said Kilsip, scornfully, with a vicious\nsnarl.\n\n\"And it's mine too,\" answered Calton, firmly. \"Whyte had some valuable\npapers, which he always carried about with him. The woman who died\nevidently told Fitzgerald that he did so; I gathered as much from an\naccidental admission he made.\"\n\nKilsip looked puzzled.\n\n\"I must confess that it is a riddle,\" he said at length; \"but if Mr.\nFitzgerald would only speak, it would clear everything up.\"\n\n\"Speak about what--the man who murdered Whyte?\"\n\n\"Well, if he did not go quite so far as that he might at least supply\nthe motive for the crime.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so,\" answered Calton, as the detective rose to go; \"but it's\nno use. Fitzgerald for some reason or another, has evidently made up\nhis mind not to speak, so our only hope in saving him lies in finding\nthis girl.\"\n\n\"If she's anywhere in Australia you may be sure she'll be found,\"\nanswered Kilsip, confidently, as he took his departure. \"Australia\nisn't so over-crowded as all that.\"\n\nBut if Sal Rawlins was in Australia at all she certainly must have been\nin some very remote part. All efforts to find her proved futile. It was\nan open question if she was alive or dead; she seemed to have vanished\ncompletely. She was last seen in a Sydney den with a Chinaman whom\nafterwards she appears to have left. Since then, nothing whatever was\nknown of her. Notices offering large rewards for her discovery were\ninserted in all the newspapers, Australian and New Zealand; but nothing\ncame of them. As she herself was unable to read there seemed little\nchance of her knowing of them; and, if, as Calton surmised she had\nchanged her name, no one would be likely to tell her of them. There was\nonly the bare chance that she might hear of them casually, or that she\nmight turn up of her own accord. If she returned to Melbourne she would\ncertainly go to her grandmother's. She had no motive for not doing so.\nSo Kilsip kept a sharp watch on the house, much to Mrs. Rawlins'\ndisgust, for, with true English pride, she objected to this system of\nespionage.\n\n\"Cuss 'im,\" she croaked over her evening drink, to an old crone, as\nwithered and evil-looking as herself, \"why can't 'e stop in 'is own\nbloomin' 'ouse, an' leave mine alone--a-comin' round 'ere a-pokin' and\npryin' and a-perwenting people from earnin' their livin' an' a-gittin'\ndrunk when they ain't well.\"\n\n\"What do 'e want?\" asked her friend, rubbing her weak old knees.\n\n\"Wants?--'e wants 'is throat cut,\" said Mother Guttersnipe, viciously.\n\"An' s'elp me I'll do for 'im some night w'en 'e's a watchin' round\n'ere as if it were Pentridge--'e can git what he can out of that whelp\nas ran away, but I knows suthin' 'e don't know, cuss 'im.\"\n\nShe ended with a senile laugh, and her companion having taken advantage\nof the long speech to drink some gin out of the broken cup, Mother\nGuttersnipe seized the unfortunate old creature by the hair, and in\nspite of her feeble cries, banged her head against the wall.\n\n\"I'll have the perlice in at yer,\" whimpered the assaulted one, as she\ntottered as quickly away as her rheumatics would allow her. \"See if I\ndon't.\"\n\n\"Get out,\" retorted Mother Guttersnipe, indifferently, as she filled\nherself a fresh cup. \"You come a-falutin' round 'ere agin priggin' my\ndrinks, cuss you, an' I'll cut yer throat an' wring yer wicked old 'ead\norf.\"\n\nThe other gave a howl of dismay at hearing this pleasant proposal, and\ntottered out as quickly as possible, leaving Mother Guttersnipe in\nundisputed possession of the field.\n\nMeanwhile Calton had seen Brian several times, and used every argument\nin his power to get him to tell everything, but he either maintained an\nobstinate silence, or merely answered, \"It would only break her heart.\"\n\nHe admitted to Calton, after a good deal of questioning, that he had\nbeen at Mother Guttersnipe's on the night of the murder. After he had\nleft Whyte by the corner of the Scotch Church, as the\ncabman--Royston--had stated, he had gone along Russell Street, and met\nSal Rawlins near the Unicorn Hotel. She had taken him to Mother\nGuttersnipe's, where he had seen the dying woman, who had told him\nsomething he could not reveal.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Calton, after hearing the admission, \"you might have\nsaved us all this trouble by admitting this before, and yet kept your\nsecret, whatever it may be. Had you done so, we might have got hold of\nSal Rawlins before she left Melbourne; but now it's a mere chance\nwhether she turns up or not.\"\n\nBrian did not answer to this; in fact, he seemed hardly to be thinking\nof what the lawyer was saying; but just as Calton was leaving, he\nasked--\n\n\"How is Madge?\"\n\n\"How can you expect her to be?\" said Calton, turning angrily on him.\n\"She is very ill, owing to the worry she has had over this affair.\"\n\n\"My darling! My darling!\" cried Brian, in agony, clasping his hands\nabove his head. \"I did it only to save you.\"\n\nCalton approached him, and laid his hand lightly on his shoulder.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" he said, gravely, \"the confidences between lawyer and\nclient are as sacred as those between priest and penitent. You must\ntell me this secret which concerns Miss Frettlby so deeply.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Brian, firmly, \"I will never repeat what that wretched woman\ntold me. When I would not tell you before, in order to save my life, it\nis not likely I am going to do so now, when I have nothing to gain and\neverything to lose by telling it.\"\n\n\"I will never ask you again,\" said Calton, rather annoyed, as he walked\nto the door. \"And as to this accusation of murder, if I can find this\ngirl, you are safe.\"\n\nWhen the lawyer left the gaol, he went to the Detective Office to see\nKilsip, and ascertain if there was any news of Sal Rawlins; but, as\nusual, there was none.\n\n\"It is fighting against Fate,\" he said, sadly, as he went away; \"his\nlife hangs on a mere chance.\"\n\nThe trial was fixed to come off in September, and, of course, there was\ngreat excitement in Melbourne as the time drew near. Great, therefore,\nwas the disappointment when it was discovered that the prisoner's\ncounsel had applied for an adjournment of the trial till October, on\nthe ground that an important witness for the defence could not be found.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nTHE TRIAL.\n\n\nIn spite of the utmost vigilance on the part of the police, and the\noffer of a large reward, both by Calton, on behalf of the accused, and\nby Mr. Frettlby, the much-desired Sal Rawlins still remained hidden.\nThe millionaire had maintained a most friendly attitude towards Brian\nthroughout the whole affair. He refused to believe him guilty, and when\nCalton told him of the defence of proving an ALIBI by means of Sal\nRawlins, he immediately offered a large reward, which was in itself\nenough to set every person with any time on their hands hunting for the\nmissing witness.\n\nAll Australia and New Zealand rang with the extremely plebeian name of\nSal Rawlins, the papers being full of notices offering rewards; and\nhandbills of staring red letters were posted up in all railway\nstations, in conjunction with \"Liquid Sunshine\" Rum and \"D.W.D.\"\nWhisky. She had become famous without knowing it, unless, indeed, she\nhad kept herself concealed purposely, but this was hardly probable, as\nthere was no apparent motive for her doing so. If she was above ground\nshe must certainly have seen the handbills, if not the papers; and\nthough not able to read, she could hardly help hearing something about\nthe one topic of conversation throughout Australia. Notwithstanding all\nthis, Sal Rawlins was still undiscovered, and Calton, in despair, began\nto think that she must be dead. But Madge, though at times her courage\ngave way, was still hopeful.\n\n\"God will not permit such a judicial crime as the murder of an innocent\nman to be committed,\" she declared.\n\nMr. Calton, to whom she said this, shook his head doubtfully.\n\n\"God has permitted it to take place before,\" he answered softly; \"and\nwe can only judge the future by the past.\"\n\nAt last, the day of the long-expected trial came, and as Calton sat in\nhis office looking over his brief, a clerk entered and told him Mr.\nFrettlby and his daughter wished to see him. When they came in, the\nbarrister saw that the millionaire looked haggard and ill, and there\nwas a worried expression on his face.\n\n\"There is my daughter, Calton,\" he said, after hurried greetings had\nbeen exchanged. \"She wants to be present in Court during Fitzgerald's\ntrial, and nothing I can say will dissuade her.\"\n\nCalton turned, and looked at the girl in some surprise.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, meeting his look steadily, though her face was\nvery pale; \"I must be there. I shall go mad with anxiety unless I know\nhow the trial goes on.\"\n\n\"But think of the disagreeable amount of attention you will attract,\"\nurged the lawyer.\n\n\"No one will recognise me,\" she said calmly, \"I am very plainly\ndressed, and I will wear this veil;\" and, drawing one from her pocket,\nshe went to a small looking-glass which was hanging on the wall, and\ntied it over her face.\n\nCalton looked in perplexity at Mr. Frettlby.\n\n\"I'm afraid you must consent,\" he said.\n\n\"Very well,\" replied the other, almost sternly, while a look of\nannoyance passed over his face. \"I shall leave her in your charge.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"I'm not coming,\" answered Frettlby, quickly, putting on his hat. \"I\ndon't care about seeing a man whom I have had at my dinner-table, in\nthe prisoner's dock, much as I sympathise with him. Good-day;\" and with\na curt nod he took his leave. When the door closed on her father, Madge\nplaced her hand on Calton's arm.\n\n\"Any hope?\" she whispered, looking at him through the black veil.\n\n\"The merest chance,\" answered Calton, putting his brief into his bag.\n\"We have done everything in our power to discover this girl, but\nwithout result. If she does not come at the eleventh hour I'm afraid\nBrian Fitzgerald is a doomed man.\"\n\nMadge fell on her knees, with a stifled cry.\n\n\"Oh, God of Mercy,\" she cried, raising her hands as if in prayer, \"save\nhim. Save my darling, and let him not die for the crime of another.\nGod--\"\n\nShe dropped her face in her hands and wept convulsively, as the lawyer\ntouched her lightly on the shoulder.\n\n\"Come!\" he said kindly. \"Be the brave girl you were, and we may save\nhim yet. The hour is darkest before the dawn, you know.\"\n\nMadge dried her tears, and followed the lawyer to the cab, which was\nwaiting for them at the door. They drove quickly up to the Court, and\nCalton put her in a quiet place, where she could see the dock, and yet\nbe unobserved by the people in the body of the Court. Just as he was\nleaving her she touched his arm.\n\n\"Tell him,\" she whispered, in a trembling voice, \"tell him I am here.\"\n\nCalton nodded, and hurried away to put on his wig and gown, while Madge\nlooked hurriedly round the Court from her point of vantage.\n\nIt was crowded with fashionable Melbourne of both sexes, and they were\nall talking together in subdued whispers. The popular character of the\nprisoner, his good looks, and engagement to Madge Frettlby, together\nwith the extraordinary circumstances of the case, had raised public\ncuriosity to the highest pitch, and, consequently, everybody who could\npossibly manage to gain admission was there.\n\nFelix Rolleston had secured an excellent seat beside the pretty Miss\nFeatherweight, whom he admired so much, and he was chattering to her\nwith the utmost volubility.\n\n\"Puts me in mind of the Coliseum and all that sort of thing, you know,\"\nhe said, putting up his eye-glass and staring round. \"Butchered to\nmake a Roman holiday by jove.\"\n\n\"Don't say such horrid things, you frivolous creature,\" simpered Miss\nFeatherweight, using her smelling-bottle. \"We are all here out of\nsympathy for that poor dear Mr. Fitzgerald.\"\n\nThe mercurial Felix, who had more cleverness in him than people gave\nhim credit for, smiled outright at this eminently feminine way of\ncovering an overpowering curiosity.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" he said lightly; \"exactly. I daresay Eve only ate the apple\nbecause she didn't like to see such a lot of good fruit go to waste.\"\n\nMiss Featherweight eyed him doubtfully. She was not quite certain\nwhether he was in jest or earnest. Just as she was about to reply to\nthe effect that she thought it wicked to make the Bible a subject for\njoking, the Judge entered and the Court rose.\n\nWhen the prisoner was brought in, there was a great flutter among the\nladies, and some of them even had the bad taste to produce\nopera-glasses. Brian noticed this, and he flushed up to the roots of\nhis fair hair, for he felt his degradation acutely. He was an intensely\nproud man, and to be placed in the criminal dock, with a lot of\nfrivolous people, who had called themselves his friends, looking at him\nas though he were a new actor or a wild animal, was galling in the\nextreme. He was dressed in black, and looked pale and worn, but all the\nladies declared that he was as good-looking as ever, and they were sure\nhe was innocent.\n\nThe jury were sworn in, and the Crown Prosecutor rose to deliver his\nopening address.\n\nMost of those present knew the facts only through the medium of the\nnewspapers, and such floating rumours as they had been able to gather.\nThey were therefore unaware of the true history of events which had led\nto Fitzgerald's arrest, and they prepared to listen to the speech with\nprofound attention.\n\nThe ladies ceased to talk, the men to stare round, and nothing could be\nseen but row after row of eager and attentive faces, hanging on the\nwords that issued from the lips of the Crown Prosecutor. He was not a\ngreat orator, but he spoke clearly and distinctly, and every word could\nbe heard in the dead silence.\n\nHe gave a rapid sketch of the crime--merely a repetition of what had\nbeen published in the newspapers--and then proceeded to enumerate the\nwitnesses for the prosecution.\n\nHe would call the landlady of the deceased to show that ill-feeling\nexisted between the prisoner and the murdered man, and that the accused\nhad called on the deceased a week prior to the committal of the crime,\nand threatened his life. (There was great excitement at this, and\nseveral ladies decided, on the spur of the moment, that the horrid man\nwas guilty, but the majority of them still refused to believe in the\nguilt of such a good-looking young fellow.) He would call a witness who\ncould prove that Whyte was drunk on the night of the murder, and went\nalong Russell Street, in the direction of Collins Street; the cabman\nRoyston could swear to the fact that the prisoner had hailed the cab,\nand after going away for a short time, returned and entered the cab\nwith the deceased. He would also prove that the prisoner left the cab\nat the Grammar School, in the St. Kilda Road, and on the arrival of the\ncab at the junction, he discovered the deceased had been murdered. The\ncabman Rankin would prove that he drove the prisoner from the St. Kilda\nRoad to Powlett Street in East Melbourne, where he got out; and he\nwould call the prisoner's landlady to prove that the prisoner resided\nin Powlett Street, and that on the night of the murder he had not\nreached home till shortly after two o'clock. He would also call the\ndetective who had charge of the case, to prove the finding of a glove\nbelonging to the deceased in the pocket of the coat which the prisoner\nwore on the night of the murder; and the doctor who had examined the\nbody of the deceased would give evidence that the death was caused by\ninhalation of chloroform. As he had now fully shown the chain of\nevidence which he proposed to prove, he would call the first witness,\nMALCOLM ROYSTON.\n\nROYSTON, on being sworn, gave the same evidence as he had given at the\ninquest, from the time that the cab was hailed up to his arrival at the\nSt. Kilda Police Station with the dead body of Whyte. In the\ncross-examination, Calton asked him if he was prepared to swear that\nthe man who hailed the cab, and the man who got in with the deceased,\nwere one and the same person.\n\nWITNESS: I am.\n\nCALTON: You are quite certain?\n\nWITNESS: Yes; quite certain.\n\nCALTON: Do you then recognise the prisoner as the man who hailed the\ncab?\n\nWITNESS (hesitatingly): I cannot swear to that. The gentleman who\nhailed the cab had his hat pulled down over his eyes, so that I could\nnot see his face; but the height and general appearance of the prisoner\nare the same.\n\nCALTON: Then it is only because the man who got into the cab was\ndressed like the prisoner on that night that you thought they were both\nthe same?\n\nWITNESS: It never struck me for a minute that they were not the same.\nBesides, he spoke as if he had been there before. I said, \"Oh, you've\ncome back,\" and he said, \"Yes; I'm going to take him home,\" and got\ninto my cab.\n\nCALTON: Did you notice any difference in his voice?\n\nWITNESS: No; except that the first time I saw him he spoke in a loud\nvoice, and the second time he came back, very low.\n\nCALTON: You were sober, I suppose?\n\nWITNESS (indignantly): Yes; quite sober.\n\nCALTON: Ah! You did not have a drink, say at the Oriental Hotel, which,\nI believe, is near the rank where your cab stands?\n\nWITNESS (hesitating): Well, I might have had a glass.\n\nCALTON: So you might; you might have had several.\n\nWITNESS (sulkily): Well, there's no law against a cove feeling thirsty.\n\nCALTON: Certainly not; and I suppose you took advantage of the absence\nof such a law.\n\nWITNESS (defiantly): Yes, I did.\n\nCALTON: And you were elevated?\n\nWITNESS: Yes; on my cab.--(Laughter.)\n\nCALTON (severely): You are here to give evidence, sir, not to make\njokes, however clever they may be. Were you, or were you not, slightly\nthe worse for drink?\n\nWITNESS: I might have been.\n\nCALTON: So you were in such a condition that you did not observe very\nclosely the man who hailed you?\n\nWITNESS: No, I didn't--there was no reason why I should--I didn't know\na murder was going to be committed.\n\nCALTON: And it never struck you it might be a different man?\n\nWITNESS: No; I thought it was the same man the whole time.\n\nThis closed Royston's evidence, and Calton sat down very dissatisfied\nat not being able to elicit anything more definite from him. One thing\nappeared clear, that someone must have dressed himself to resemble\nBrian, and have spoken in a low voice for fear of betraying himself.\n\nClement Rankin, the next witness, deposed to having picked up the\nprisoner on the St. Kilda Road between one and two on Friday morning,\nand driven him to Powlett Street, East Melbourne. In the\ncross-examination, Calton elicited one point in the prisoner's favour.\n\nCALTON: Is the prisoner the same gentleman you drove to Powlett Street?\n\nWITNESS (confidently): Oh, yes.\n\nCALTON: How do you know? Did you see his face?\n\nWITNESS: No, his hat was pulled down over his eyes, and I could only\nsee the ends of his moustache and his chin, but he carried himself the\nsame as the prisoner, and his moustache is the same light colour.\n\nCALTON: When you drove up to him on the St. Kilda Road, where was he,\nand what was he doing?\n\nWITNESS: He was near the Grammar School, walking quickly in the\ndirection of Melbourne, and was smoking a cigarette.\n\nCALTON: Did he wear gloves?\n\nWITNESS: Yes, one on the left hand, the other was bare.\n\nCALTON: Did he wear any rings on the right hand?\n\nWITNESS: Yes, a large diamond one on the forefinger.\n\nCALTON: Are you sure?\n\nWITNESS: Yes, because I thought it a curious place for a gentleman to\nwear a ring, and when he was paying me my fare, I saw the diamond\nglitter on his finger in the moonlight.\n\nCALTON: That will do.\n\nThe counsel for the defence was pleased with this bit of evidence, as\nFitzgerald detested rings, and never wore any; so he made a note of the\nmatter on his brief.\n\nMrs. Hableton, the landlady of the deceased, was then called, and\ndeposed that Oliver Whyte had lodged with her for nearly two months. He\nseemed a quiet enough young man, but often came home drunk. The only\nfriend she knew he had was a Mr. Moreland, who was often with him. On\nthe 14th July, the prisoner called to see Mr. Whyte, and they had a\nquarrel. She heard Whyte say, \"She is mine, you can't do anything with\nher,\" and the prisoner answered, \"I can kill you, and if you marry her\nI shall do so in the open street.\" She had no idea at the time of the\nname of the lady they were talking about. There was a great sensation\nin the court at these words, and half the people present looked upon\nsuch evidence as being sufficient in itself to prove the guilt of the\nprisoner.\n\nIn cross-examination, Calton was unable to shake the evidence of the\nwitness, as she merely reiterated the same statements over and over\nagain.\n\nThe next witness was Mrs. Sampson, who crackled into the witness-box\ndissolved in tears, and gave her answers in a piercingly shrill tone of\nanguish. She stated that the prisoner was in the habit of coming home\nearly, but on the night of the murder, had come in shortly before two\no'clock.\n\nCROWN PROSECUTOR (referring to his brief): You mean after two.\n\nWITNESS: 'Avin made a mistake once, by saying five minutes after two to\nthe policeman as called hisself a insurance agent, which 'e put the\nwords into my mouth, I ain't a goin' to do so again, it bein' five\nminutes afore two, as I can swear to.\n\nCROWN PROSECUTOR: You are sure your clock was right?\n\nWITNESS: It 'adn't bin, but my nevy bein' a watchmaker, called\nunbeknown to me, an' made it right on Thursday night, which it was\nFriday mornin' when Mr. Fitzgerald came 'ome.\n\nMrs. Sampson bravely stuck to this statement, and ultimately left the\nwitness-box in triumph, the rest of her evidence being comparatively\nunimportant as compared with this point of time. The witness Rankin,\nwho drove the prisoner to Powlett Street (as sworn to by him) was\nrecalled, and gave evidence that it was two o'clock when the prisoner\ngot down from his cab in Powlett Street.\n\nCROWN PROSECUTOR: How do you know that?\n\nWITNESS: Because I heard the Post Office clock strike.\n\nCROWN PROSECUTOR: Could you hear it at East Melbourne?\n\nWITNESS: It was a very still night, and I heard the chimes and then the\nhour strike quite plainly.\n\nThis conflicting evidence as to time was a strong point in Brian's\nfavour. If, as the landlady stated, on the authority of the kitchen\nclock, which had been put right on the day previous to the murder,\nFitzgerald had come into the house at five minutes to two, he could not\npossibly be the man who had alighted from Rankin's cab at two o'clock\nat Powlett Street.\n\nThe next witness was Dr. Chinston, who swore to the death of the\ndeceased by means of chloroform administered in a large quantity, and\nhe was followed by Mr. Gorby, who deposed as to the finding of the\nglove belonging to the deceased in the pocket of the prisoner's coat.\n\nRoger Moreland, an intimate friend of the deceased, was next called. He\nstated that he had known the deceased in London, and had met him in\nMelbourne. He was with him a great deal. On the night of the murder he\nwas in the Orient Hotel in Bourke Street. Whyte came in, and was\ngreatly excited. He was in evening dress, and wore a light coat. They\nhad several drinks together, and then went up to an hotel in Russell\nStreet, and had some more drinks there. Both witness and deceased were\nintoxicated. Whyte took off his light coat, saying he felt warm, and\nwent out shortly afterwards, leaving witness asleep in the bar. He was\nawakened by the barman, who wanted him to leave the hotel. He saw that\nWhyte had left his coat behind him, and took it up with the intention\nof giving it to him. As he stood in the street some one snatched the\ncoat from him and made off with it. He tried to follow the thief, but\nhe could not do so, being too intoxicated. He then went home, and to\nbed, as he had to leave early for the country in the morning. In\ncross-examination:--\n\nCALTON: When you went into the street, after leaving the hotel, did you\nsee the deceased?\n\nWITNESS: No, I did not; but I was very drunk, and unless deceased had\nspoken to me, I would not have noticed him.\n\nCALTON: What was deceased excited about when you met him?\n\nWITNESS: I don't know. He did not say.\n\nCALTON: What were you talking about?\n\nWITNESS: All sorts of things. London principally.\n\nCALTON: Did the deceased mention anything about papers?\n\nWITNESS (surprised): No, he did not.\n\nCALTON: Are you sure?\n\nWITNESS: Quite sure.\n\nCALTON: What time did you get home?\n\nWITNESS: I don't know; I was too drunk to remember.\n\nThis closed the case for the Crown, and as it was now late the case was\nadjourned till the next day.\n\nThe Court was soon emptied of the busy, chattering crowd, and Calton,\non looking over his notes, found that the result of the first day's\ntrial was two points in favour of Fitzgerald. First: the discrepancy of\ntime in the evidence of Rankin and the landlady, Mrs. Sampson. Second:\nthe evidence of the cabman Royston, as to the wearing of a ring on the\nforefinger of the right hand by the man who murdered Whyte, whereas\nthe prisoner never wore rings.\n\nThese were slender proofs of innocence to put against the overwhelming\nmass of evidence in favour of the prisoner's guilt. The opinions of all\nwere pretty well divided, some being in favour and others against, when\nsuddenly an event happened which surprised everyone. All over Melbourne\nextras were posted, and the news passed from lip to lip like\nwildfire--\"Return of the Missing Witness, Sal Rawlins!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nSAL RAWLINS TELLS ALL SHE KNOWS.\n\n\nAnd, indeed, such was the case. Sal Rawlins had made her appearance at\nthe eleventh hour, to the heartfelt thankfulness of Calton, who saw in\nher an angel from heaven, sent to save the life of an innocent man.\n\nIt was at the conclusion of the trial; and, together with Madge, he had\ngone down to his office, when his clerk entered with a telegram. The\nlawyer opened it hastily, and, with a silent look of pleasure on his\nface, handed the telegram to Madge.\n\nShe, womanlike, being more impulsive, gave a cry when she read it, and,\nfalling on her knees, thanked God for having heard her prayers, and\nsaved her lover's life.\n\n\"Take me to her at once,\" she implored the lawyer.\n\nShe was anxious to hear from Sal Rawlins' own lips the joyful words\nwhich would save Brian from a felon's death.\n\n\"No, my dear,\" answered Calton, firmly, but kindly. \"I can hardly take\na lady to the place where Sal Rawlins lives. You will know all\nto-morrow, but, meanwhile, you must go home and get some sleep.\"\n\n\"And you will tell him?\" she whispered, clasping her hands on Calton's\narm.\n\n\"At once,\" he answered promptly. \"And I will see Sal Rawlins to-night,\nand hear what she has to say. Rest content, my dear,\" he added, as he\nplaced her in the carriage, \"he is perfectly safe now.\"\n\nBrian heard the good news with a deep feeling of gratitude, knowing\nthat his life was safe, and that he could still keep his secret. It was\nthe natural revulsion of feeling after the unnatural life he had been\nleading since his arrest. When one is young and healthy, and has all\nthe world before one, it is a terrible thing to contemplate a sudden\ndeath. And yet, in spite of his joy at being delivered from the\nhangman's rope, there mingled with his delight the horror of that\nsecret which the dying woman had told him with such malignant joy.\n\n\"I had rather she had died in silence than she should have bequeathed\nme this legacy of sorrow.\"\n\nAnd the gaoler, seeing his haggard face the next morning, muttered to\nhimself, \"He war blest if the swell warn't sorry he war safe.\"\n\nSo, while Brian was pacing up and down his cell during the weary\nwatches of the night, Madge, in her own room, was kneeling beside her\nbed and thanking God for His great mercy; and Calton, the good fairy of\nthe two lovers, was hurrying towards the humble abode of Mrs. Rawlins,\nfamiliarly known as Mother Guttersnipe. Kilsip was beside him, and they\nwere talking eagerly about the providential appearance of the\ninvaluable witness.\n\n\"What I like,\" observed Kilsip, in his soft, purring tone, \"is the sell\nit will be for that Gorby. He was so certain that Mr. Fitzgerald was\nthe man, and when he gets off to-morrow Gorby will be in a rage.\"\n\n\"Where was Sal the whole time?\" asked Calton, absently, not thinking of\nwhat the detective was saying.\n\n\"Ill,\" answered Kilsip. \"After she left the Chinaman she went into the\ncountry, caught cold by falling into some river, and ended up by\ngetting brain fever. Some people found her, took her in, and nursed\nher. When she got well she came back to her grandmother's.\"\n\n\"But why didn't the people who nursed her tell her she was wanted? They\nmust have seen the papers.\"\n\n\"Not they,\" retorted the detective. \"They knew nothing.\"\n\n\"Vegetables!\" muttered Calton, contemptuously. \"How can people be so\nignorant! Why, all Australia has been ringing with the case. At any\nrate, it's money out of their pocket. Well?\"\n\n\"There's nothing more to tell,\" said Kilsip, \"except that she turned up\nto-night at five o'clock, looking more like a corpse than anything\nelse.\"\n\nWhen they entered the squalid, dingy passage that led to Mother\nGuttersnipe's abode, they saw a faint light streaming down the stair.\nAs they climbed up they could hear the rancorous voice of the old hag\npouring forth alternate blessings and curses on her prodigal offspring,\nand the low tones of a girl's voice in reply. On entering the room\nCalton saw that the sick woman, who had been lying in the corner on the\noccasion of his last visit, was gone. Mother Guttersnipe was seated in\nfront of the deal table, with a broken cup and her favourite bottle of\nspirits before her. She evidently intended to have a night of it, in\norder to celebrate Sal's return, and had commenced early, so as to lose\nno time. Sal herself was seated on a broken chair, and leaned wearily\nagainst the wall. She stood up as Calton and the detective entered, and\nthey saw that she was a tall, slender woman of about twenty-five, not\nbad-looking, but with a pallid and haggard appearance from recent\nillness. She was clothed in a kind of tawdry blue dress, much soiled\nand torn, and had over her shoulders an old tartan shawl, which she\ndrew tightly across her breast as the strangers entered. Her\ngrandmother, who looked more weird and grotesquely horrible than ever,\nsaluted Calton and the detective on their entrance with a shrill yell,\nand a volley of choice language.\n\n\"Oh, ye've come again, 'ave ye,\" she screeched, raising her skinny\narms, \"to take my gal away from 'er pore old gran'mother, as nussed\n'er, cuss her, when 'er own mother had gone a-gallivantin' with swells.\nI'll 'ave the lawr of ye both, s'elp me, I will.\"\n\nKilsip paid no attention to this outbreak of the old fury, but turned\nto the girl.\n\n\"This is the gentleman who wants to speak to you,\" he said, gently,\nmaking the girl sit on the chair again, for indeed she looked too ill\nto stand. \"Just tell him what you told me.\"\n\n\"'Bout the 'Queen,' sir?\" said Sal, in a low, hoarse voice, fixing her\nwild eyes on Calton. \"If I'd only known as you was a-wantin' me I'd\n'ave come afore.\"\n\n\"Where were you?\" asked Calton, in a pitying tone.\n\n\"Noo South Wales,\" answered the girl with a shiver. \"The cove as I went\nwith t' Sydney left me--yes, left me to die like a dog in the gutter.\"\n\n\"Cuss 'im!\" croaked the old woman in a sympathetic manner, as she took\na drink from the broken cup.\n\n\"I tooked up with a Chinerman,\" went on her granddaughter, wearily,\n\"an' lived with 'im for a bit--it's orful, ain't it?\" she said with a\ndreary laugh, as she saw the disgust on the lawyer's face. \"But\nChinermen ain't bad; they treat a pore girl a dashed sight better nor a\nwhite cove does. They don't beat the life out of 'em with their fists,\nnor drag 'em about the floor by the 'air.\"\n\n\"Cuss 'em!\" croaked Mother Guttersnipe, drowsily, \"I'll tear their\n'earts out.\"\n\n\"I think I must have gone mad, I must,\" said Sal, pushing her tangled\nhair off her forehead, \"for arter I left the Chiner cove, I went on\nwalkin' and walkin' right into the bush, a-tryin' to cool my 'ead, for\nit felt on fire like. I went into a river an' got wet, an' then I took\nmy 'at an' boots orf an' lay down on the grass, an' then the rain comed\non, an' I walked to a 'ouse as was near, where they tooked me in. Oh,\nsich kind people,\" she sobbed, stretching out her hands, \"that didn't\nbadger me 'bout my soul, but gave me good food to eat. I gave 'em a\nwrong name. I was so 'fraid of that Army a-findin' me. Then I got ill,\nan' knowd nothin' for weeks. They said I was orf my chump. An' then I\ncame back 'ere to see gran'.\"\n\n\"Cuss ye,\" said the old woman, but in such a tender tone that it\nsounded like a blessing.\n\n\"And did the people who took you in never tell you anything about the\nmurder?\" asked Calton.\n\nSal shook her head.\n\n\"No, it were a long way in the country, and they never knowd anythin',\nthey didn't.\"\n\n\"Ah! that explains it,\" muttered Calton to himself.\n\n\"Come, now,\" he said cheerfully, \"tell me all that happened on the\nnight you brought Mr. Fitzgerald to see the 'Queen.'\"\n\n\"Who's 'e?\" asked Sal, puzzled.\n\n\"Mr. Fitzgerald, the gentleman you brought the letter for to the\nMelbourne Club.\"\n\n\"Oh, 'im?\" said Sal, a sudden light breaking over her wan face. \"I\nnever knowd his name afore.\"\n\nCalton nodded complacently.\n\n\"I knew you didn't,\" he said, \"that's why you didn't ask for him at the\nClub.\"\n\n\"She never told me 'is name,\" said Sal, jerking her head in the\ndirection of the bed.\n\n\"Then whom did she ask you to bring to her?\" asked Calton, eagerly.\n\n\"No one,\" replied the girl. \"This was the way of it. On that night she\nwas orfil ill, an' I sat beside 'er while gran' was asleep.\"\n\n\"I was drunk,\" broke in gran', fiercely, \"none of yer lies; I was\nblazin' drunk.\"\n\n\"An' ses she to me, she ses,\" went on the girl, indifferent to her\ngrandmother's interruption, \"'Get me some paper an' a pencil, an' I'll\nwrite a note to 'im, I will.' So I goes an' gits 'er what she arsks fur\nout of gran's box.\"\n\n\"Stole it, cuss ye,\" shrieked the old hag, shaking her fist.\n\n\"Hold your tongue,\" said Kilsip, in a peremptory tone.\n\nMother Guttersnipe burst into a volley of oaths, and having run rapidly\nthrough all she knew, subsided into a sulky silence.\n\n\"She wrote on it,\" went on Sal, \"an' then arsked me to take it to the\nMelbourne Club an' give it to 'im. Ses I, 'Who's 'im?' Ses she, 'It's\non the letter; don't you arsk no questions an' you won't 'ear no lies,\nbut give it to 'im at the Club, an' wait for 'im at the corner of\nBourke Street and Russell Street.' So out I goes, and gives it to a\ncove at the Club, an' then 'e comes along, an' ses 'e, 'Take me to\n'er,' and I tooked 'im.\"\n\n\"And what like was the gentleman?\"\n\n\"Oh, werry good lookin',\" said Sal. \"Werry tall, with yeller 'air an'\nmoustache. He 'ad party clothes on, an' a masher coat, an' a soft 'at.\"\n\n\"That's Fitzgerald right enough,\" muttered Calton. \"And what did he do\nwhen he came?\"\n\n\"He goes right up to 'er, and she ses, 'Are you 'e?' and 'e ses, 'I\nam.' Then ses she, 'Do you know what I'm a-goin' to tell you?' an' 'e\nsays, 'No.' Then she ses, 'It's about 'er;' and ses 'e, lookin' very\nwhite, ''Ow dare you 'ave 'er name on your vile lips?' an' she gits up\nan' screeches, 'Turn that gal out, an' I'll tell you;' an' 'e takes me\nby the arm, an' ses 'e, ''Ere git out,' an' I gits out, an' that's all\nI knows.\"\n\n\"And how long was he with her?\" asked Calton, who had been listening\nattentively.\n\n\"'Bout arf-a-hour,\" answered Sal. \"I takes 'im back to Russell Street\n'bout twenty-five minutes to two, 'cause I looked at the clock on the\nPost Office, an' 'e gives me a sov., an' then he goes a-tearin' up the\nstreet like anything.\"\n\n\"Take him about twenty minutes to walk to East Melbourne,\" said Calton\nto himself \"So he must just have got in at the time Mrs. Sampson said.\nHe was in with the 'Queen' the whole time, I suppose?\" he asked,\nlooking keenly at Sal.\n\n\"I was at that door,\" said Sal, pointing to it, \"an' 'e couldn't 'ave\ngot out unless I'd seen 'im.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's all right,\" said Calton, nodding to Kilsip, \"there won't be\nany difficulty in proving an ALIBI. But I say,\" he added, turning to\nSal, \"what were they talking about?\"\n\n\"I dunno,\" answered Sal. \"I was at the door, an' they talks that quiet\nI couldn't 'ear 'em. Then he sings out, 'My G--, it's too horrible!'\nan' I 'ear 'er a larfin' like to bust, an' then 'e comes to me, and\nses, quite wild like, 'Take me out of this 'ell!' an' I tooked 'im.\"\n\n\"And when you came back?\"\n\n\"She was dead.\"\n\n\"Dead?\"\n\n\"As a blessed door-nail,\" said Sal, cheerfully.\n\n\"An' I never knowd I was in the room with a corpse,\" wailed Mother\nGuttersnipe, waking up. \"Cuss 'er, she was allays a-doin' contrary\nthings.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" said Calton, sharply, as he rose to go.\n\n\"I knowd 'er longer nor you,\" croaked the old woman, fixing one evil\neye on the lawyer; \"an' I know what you'd like to know; but ye shan't,\nye shan't.\"\n\nCalton turned from her with a shrug of his shoulders.\n\n\"You will come to the Court to-morrow with Mr. Kilsip,\" he said to Sal,\n\"and tell what you have just now told me.\"\n\n\"It's all true, s'elp me,\" said Sal, eagerly; \"'e was 'ere all the\ntime.\"\n\nCalton stepped towards the door, followed by the detective, when Mother\nGuttersnipe rose.\n\n\"Where's the money for finin' her?\" she screeched, pointing one skinny\nfinger at Sal.\n\n\"Well, considering the girl found herself,\" said Calton, dryly, \"the\nmoney is in the bank, and will remain there.\"\n\n\"An' I'm to be done out of my 'ard earned tin, s'elp me?\" howled the\nold fury. \"Cuss ye, I'll 'ave the lawr of ye, and get ye put in quod.\"\n\n\"You'll go there yourself if you don't take care,\" said Kilsip, in his\nsoft, purring tones.\n\n\"Yah!\" shrieked Mother Guttersnipe, snapping her fingers at him. \"What\ndo I care about yer quod? Ain't I bin in Pentrig', an' it ain't 'urt\nme, it ain't? I'm as lively as a gal, I am.\"\n\nAnd the old fury, to prove the truth of her words, danced a kind of war\ndance in front of Mr. Calton, snapping her fingers and yelling out\ncurses, as an accompaniment to her ballet. Her luxurious white hair\nstreamed out during her gyrations, and with her grotesque appearance\nand the faint light of the candle, she presented a gruesome spectacle.\n\nCalton remembered the tales he had heard of the women of Paris, at the\nrevolution, and the way they danced \"La Carmagnole.\" Mother Guttersnipe\nwould have been in her element in that sea of blood and turbulence he\nthought. But he merely shrugged his shoulders, and walked out of the\nroom, as with a final curse, delivered in a hoarse voice, Mother\nGuttersnipe sank exhausted on the floor, and yelled for gin.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nTHE VERDICT OF THE JURY.\n\n\nNext morning the Court was crowded, and numbers were unable to gain\nadmission. The news that Sal Rawlins, who alone could prove the\ninnocence of the prisoner, had been found, and would appear in Court\nthat morning, had spread like wildfire, and the acquittal of the\nprisoner was confidently expected by a large number of sympathising\nfriends, who seemed to have sprung up on all sides, like mushrooms, in\na single night. There were, of course, plenty of cautious people left\nwho waited to hear the verdict of the jury before committing\nthemselves, and who still believed him to be guilty. But the unexpected\nappearance of Sal Rawlins had turned the great tide of public feeling\nin favour of the prisoner, and many who had been loudest in their\ndenunciations of Fitzgerald, were now more than half convinced of his\ninnocence. Pious clergymen talked in an incoherent way about the finger\nof God and the innocent not suffering unjustly, which was a case of\ncounting unhatched chickens, as the verdict had yet to be given.\n\nFelix Rolleston awoke, and found himself famous in a small way. Out of\ngood-natured sympathy, and a spice of contrariness, he had declared his\nbelief in Brian's innocence, and now, to his astonishment, he found\nthat his view of the matter was likely to prove correct. He received so\nmuch praise on all sides for his presumed perspicuity, that he soon\nbegan to think that he had believed in Fitzgerald's innocence by a calm\ncourse of reasoning, and not because of a desire to differ from every\none else in their opinion of the case. After all, Felix Rolleston is\nnot the only man who has been astonished to find greatness thrust upon\nhim, and come to believe himself worthy of it. He was a wise man,\nhowever, and while in the full tide of prosperity he seized the flying\nmoment, and proposed to Miss Featherweight, who, after some hesitation,\nagreed to endow him with herself and her thousands. She decided that\nher future husband was a man of no common intellect, seeing that he had\nlong ago arrived at a conclusion which the rest of Melbourne were only\nbeginning to discover now, so she determined that, as soon as she\nassumed marital authority, Felix, like Strephon in \"Iolanthe,\" should\ngo into Parliament, and with her money and his brains she might some\nday be the wife of a premier. Mr. Rolleston had no idea of the\npolitical honours which his future spouse intended for him, and was\nseated in his old place in the court, talking about the case.\n\n\"Knew he was innocent, don't you know,\" he said, with a complacent\nsmile \"Fitzgerald's too jolly good-looking a fellow, and all that sort\nof thing, to commit murder.\"\n\nWhereupon a clergyman, happening to overhear the lively Felix make this\nflippant remark, disagreed with it entirely, and preached a sermon to\nprove that good looks and crime were closely connected, and that both\nJudas Iscariot and Nero were beauty-men.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Calton, when he heard the sermon, \"if this unique theory is\na true one, what a truly pious man that clergyman must be!\" This\nallusion to the looks of the reverend gentleman was rather unkind, for\nhe was by no means bad-looking. But then Calton was one of those witty\nmen who would rather lose a friend than suppress an epigram.\n\nWhen the prisoner was brought in, a murmur of sympathy ran through the\ncrowded Court, so ill and worn-out he looked; but Calton was puzzled to\naccount for the expression of his face, so different from that of a man\nwhose life had been saved, or, rather, was about to be saved, for in\ntruth it was a foregone conclusion.\n\n\"You know who stole those papers,\" he thought, as he looked at\nFitzgerald, keenly, \"and the man who did so is the murderer of Whyte.\"\n\nThe judge having entered, and the Court being opened, Calton rose to\nmake his speech, and stated in a few words the line of defence he\nintended to take.\n\nHe would first call Albert Dendy, a watchmaker, to prove that on\nThursday night, at eight o'clock in the evening, he had called at the\nprisoner's, lodgings while the landlady was out, and while there had\nput the kitchen clock right, and had regulated the same. He would also\ncall Felix Rolleston, a friend of the prisoners, to prove that the\nprisoner was not in the habit of wearing rings, and frequently\nexpressed his detestation of such a custom. Sebastian Brown, a waiter\nat the Melbourne Club, would be called to prove that on Thursday night\na letter was delivered to the prisoner at the Club by one Sarah\nRawlins, and that the prisoner left the Club shortly before one o'clock\non Friday morning. He would also call Sarah Rawlins, to prove that she\nhad delivered a note to Sebastian Brown for the prisoner, at the\nMelbourne Club, at a quarter to twelve on Thursday Night, and that at a\nfew minutes past one o'clock on Friday morning she had conducted the\nprisoner to a slum off Little Bourke Street, and that he was there\nbetween one and two on Friday morning, the hour at which the murder was\nalleged to have taken place. This being his defence to the charge\nbrought against the prisoner, he would call Albert Dendy.\n\nAlbert Dendy, duly sworn, stated--\n\nI am a watchmaker, and carry on business in Fitzroy. I remember\nThursday, the 26th of July last. On the evening of that day I called at\nPowlett Street East Melbourne, to see my aunt, who is the landlady of\nthe prisoner. She was out at the time I called, and I waited in the\nkitchen till her return. I looked at the kitchen clock to see if it was\ntoo late to wait, and then at my watch. I found that the clock was ten\nminutes fast, upon which I put it right, and regulated it properly.\n\nCALTON: At what time did you put it right?\n\nWITNESS: About eight o'clock.\n\nCALTON: Between that time and two in the morning, was it possible for\nthe clock to gain ten minutes?\n\nWITNESS: No, it was not possible.\n\nCALTON: Would it gain at all?\n\nWITNESS: Not between eight and two o'clock--the time was not long\nenough.\n\nCALTON: Did you see your aunt that night?\n\nWITNESS: Yes, I waited till she came in.\n\nCALTON: And did you tell her you had put the clock right?\n\nWITNESS: No, I did not; I forgot all about it.\n\nCALTON: Then she was still under the impression that it was ten minutes\nfast?\n\nWITNESS: Yes, I suppose so\n\nAfter Dendy had been cross-examined, Felix Rolleston was called, and\ndeposed as follows:--\n\nI am an intimate friend of the prisoner. I have known him for five or\nsix years, and I never saw him wearing a ring during that time. He has\nfrequently told me he did not care for rings, and would never wear them.\n\nIn cross-examination:--\n\nCROWN PROSECUTOR: You have never seen the prisoner wearing a diamond\nring?\n\nWITNESS: No, never.\n\nCROWN PROSECUTOR: Have you ever seen any such ring in his possession?\n\nWITNESS: No, I have seen him buying rings for ladies, but I never saw\nhim with any ring such as a gentleman would wear.\n\nCROWN PROSECUTOR: Not even a seal ring.\n\nWITNESS: No, not even a seal ring.\n\nSarah Rawlins was then placed in the witness-box, and, after having\nbeen sworn, deposed--\n\nI know the prisoner. I delivered a letter, addressed to him at the\nMelbourne Club, at a quarter to twelve o'clock on Thursday, 26th July.\nI did not know what his name was. He met me shortly after one, at the\ncorner of Russell and Bourke Streets, where I had been told to wait for\nhim. I took him to my grandmother's place, in a lane off Little Bourke\nStreet. There was a dying woman there, who had sent for him. He went in\nand saw her for about twenty minutes, and then I took him back to the\ncorner of Bourke and Russell Streets. I heard the three-quarters strike\nshortly after I left him.\n\nCROWN PROSECUTOR: You are quite certain that the prisoner was the man\nyou met on that night?\n\nWITNESS: Quite certin', s'elp me G--.\n\nCROWN PROSECUTOR: And he met you a few minutes past one o'clock?\n\nWITNESS: Yes, 'bout five minutes--I 'eard the clock a-strikin' one just\nafore he came down the street, and when I leaves 'im agin, it were\nabout twenty-five to two, 'cause it took me ten minits to git 'ome, and\nI 'eard the clock go three-quarters, jest as I gits to the door.\n\nCROWN PROSECUTOR: How do you know it was exactly twenty-five to two\nwhen you left him?\n\nWITNESS: 'Cause I sawr the clocks--I left 'im at the corner of Russell\nStreet, and comes down Bourke Street, so I could see the Post Orffice\nclock as plain as day, an' when I gets into Swanston Street, I looks at\nthe Town 'All premiscus like, and sees the same time there.\n\nCROWN PROSECUTOR: And you never lost sight of the prisoner the whole\ntime?\n\nWITNESS: No, there was only one door by the room, an' I was a-sittin'\noutside it, an' when he comes out he falls over me.\n\nCROWN PROSECUTOR: Were you asleep?\n\nWITNESS: Not a blessed wink.\n\nCalton then directed Sebastian Brown to be called. He deposed--\n\nI know the prisoner. He is a member of the Melbourne Club, at which I\nam a waiter. I remember Thursday, 26th July. On that night the last\nwitness came with a letter to the prisoner. It was about a quarter to\ntwelve. She just gave it to me, and went away. I delivered it to Mr.\nFitzgerald. He left the Club at about ten minutes to one.\n\nThis closed the evidence for the defence, and after the Crown\nProsecutor had made his speech, in which he pointed out the strong\nevidence against the prisoner, Calton arose to address the jury. He was\na fine speaker, and made a splendid defence. Not a single point escaped\nhim, and that brilliant piece of oratory is still remembered and spoken\nof admiringly in the purlieus of Temple Court and Chancery Lane.\n\nHe began by giving a vivid description of the circumstances, of the\nmurder--of the meeting of the murderer and his victim in Collins Street\nEast--the cab driving down to St. Kilda--the getting out of the cab of\nthe murderer after committing the crime--and the way in which he had\nsecured himself against pursuit.\n\nHaving thus enchained the attention of the jury by the graphic manner\nin which he described the crime, he pointed out that the evidence\nbrought forward by the prosecution was purely circumstantial, and that\nthey had utterly failed to identify the prisoner in the dock with the\nman who entered the cab. The supposition that the prisoner and the man\nin the light coat were one and the same person, rested solely upon the\nevidence of the cabman, Royston, who, although not intoxicated,\nwas--judging from his own statements, not in a fit state to distinguish\nbetween the man who hailed the cab, and the man who got in. The crime\nwas committed by means of chloroform; therefore, if the prisoner was\nguilty, he must have purchased the chloroform in some shop, or obtained\nit from some friends. At all events, the prosecution had not brought\nforward a single piece of evidence to show how, and where the\nchloroform had been obtained. With regard to the glove belonging to the\nmurdered man found in the prisoner's pocket, he picked it up off the\nground at the time when he first met Whyte, when the deceased was lying\ndrunk near the Scotch Church. Certainly there was no evidence to show\nthat the prisoner had picked it up before the deceased entered the cab;\nbut, on the other hand, there was no evidence to show that it had been\npicked up in the cab. It was far more likely that the glove, and\nespecially a white glove, would be picked up under the light of the\nlamp near the Scotch Church, where it was easily noticeable, than in\nthe darkness of a cab, where there was very little room, and where it\nwould be quite dark, as the blinds were drawn down. The cabman,\nRoyston, swore positively that the man who got out of his cab on the\nSt. Kilda Road wore a diamond ring on the forefinger of his right hand,\nand the cabman, Rankin, swore to the same thing about the man who got\nout at Powlett Street. Against this could be placed the evidence of one\nof the prisoner's most intimate friends--one who had seen him almost\ndaily for the last five years, and he had sworn positively that the\nprisoner was not in the habit of wearing rings.\n\nThe cabman Rankin had also sworn that the man who entered his cab on\nthe St. Kilda Road alighted at Powlett Street, East Melbourne, at two\no'clock on Friday morning, as he heard that hour strike from the Post\nOffice clock, whereas the evidence of the prisoner's landlady showed\nplainly that he entered the house five minutes previously, and her\nevidence was further supported by that of the watchmaker, Dendy. Mrs.\nSampson saw the hand of her kitchen clock point to five minutes to two,\nand, thinking it was ten minutes slow, told the detective that the\nprisoner did not enter the house till five minutes past two, which\nwould just give the man who alighted from the cab (presuming him to\nhave been the prisoner) sufficient time to walk up to his lodgings. The\nevidence of the watchmaker, Dendy, however, showed clearly that he had\nput the clock right at the hour of eight on Thursday night; that it was\nimpossible for it to gain ten minutes before two on Friday morning, and\ntherefore, the time, five minutes to two, seen by the landlady was the\ncorrect one, and the prisoner was in the house five minutes before the\nother man alighted from the cab in Powlett Street.\n\nThese points in themselves were sufficient to show that the prisoner\nwas innocent, but the evidence of the woman Rawlins must prove\nconclusively to the jury that the prisoner was not the man who\ncommitted the crime. The witness Brown had proved that the woman\nRawlins had delivered a letter to him, which he gave to the prisoner\nand that the prisoner left the Club, to keep the appointment spoken of\nin the letter, which letter, or, rather, the remains of it had been put\nin evidence. The woman Rawlins swore that the prisoner met her at the\ncorner of Russell and Bourke Streets, and had gone with her to one of\nthe back slums, there to see the writer of the letter. She also proved\nthat at the time of the committal of the crime the prisoner was still\nin the back slum, by the bed of the dying woman, and, there being only\none door to the room, he could not possibly have left without the\nwitness seeing him. The woman Rawlins further proved that she left the\nprisoner at the corner of Bourke and Russell Streets at twenty-five\nminutes to two o'clock, which was five minutes before Royston drove his\ncab up to the St. Kilda Police Station, with the dead body inside.\nFinally, the woman Rawlins proved her words by stating that she saw\nboth the Post Office and Town Hall clocks; and supposing the prisoner\nstarted from the corner of Bourke and Russell Streets, as she says he\ndid, he would reach East Melbourne in twenty minutes, which made it\nfive minutes to two on Friday morning, the time at which, according to\nthe landlady's statement, he entered the house.\n\nAll the evidence given by the different witnesses agreed completely,\nand formed a chain which showed the whole of the prisoner's movements\nat the time of the committal of the murder. Therefore, it was\nabsolutely impossible that the murder could have been committed by the\nman in the dock. The strongest piece of evidence brought forward by the\nprosecution was that of the witness Hableton, who swore that the\nprisoner used threats against the life of the deceased. But the\nlanguage used was merely the outcome of a passionate Irish nature, and\nwas not sufficient to prove the crime to have been committed by the\nprisoner. The defence which the prisoner set up was that of an ALIBI,\nand the evidence of the witnesses for the defence proved conclusively\nthat the prisoner could not, and did not, commit the murder. Finally,\nCalton wound up his elaborate and exhaustive speech, which lasted for\nover two hours, by a brilliant peroration, calling upon the jury to\nbase their verdict upon the plain facts of the case, and if they did so\nthey could hardly fail in bringing in a verdict of \"Not Guilty.\"\n\nWhen Calton sat down a subdued murmur of applause was heard, which was\ninstantly suppressed, and the judge began to sum up, strongly in favour\nof Fitzgerald. The jury then retired, and immediately there was a dead\nsilence in the crowded Court--an unnatural silence, such as must have\nfallen on the blood-loving Roman populace when they saw the Christian\nmartyrs kneeling on the hot yellow sands of the arena, and watched the\nlong, lithe forms of lion and panther creeping steadily towards their\nprey. The hour being late the gas had been lighted, and there was a\nsickly glare through the wide hall.\n\nFitzgerald had been taken out of court on the retiring of the jury, but\nthe spectators stared steadily at the empty dock, which seemed to\nenchain them by some indescribable fascination. They conversed among\nthemselves only in whispers, until even the whispering ceased, and\nnothing could be heard but the steady ticking of the clock, and now and\nthen the quick-drawn breath of some timid on-looker. Suddenly, a woman,\nwhose nerves were over-strung, shrieked, and the cry rang weirdly\nthrough the crowded hall. She was taken out, and again there was\nsilence, every eye being now fixed on the door through which the jury\nwould re-issue with their verdict of life or death. The hands of the\nclock moved slowly round--a quarter--a half--three quarters--and then\nthe hour sounded with a silvery ring which startled everyone. Madge,\nsitting with her hands tightly clasped together, began to fear that her\nhighly-strung nerves would give way.\n\n\"My God,\" she muttered softly to herself; \"will this suspense never\nend?\"\n\nJust then the door opened, and the jury re-entered. The prisoner was\nagain placed in the dock, and the judge resumed his seat, this time\nwith the black cap in his pocket, as everyone guessed.\n\nThe usual formalities were gone through, and when the foreman of the\njury stood up every neck was craned forward, and every ear was on the\nalert to catch the words that fell from his lips. The prisoner flushed\na little and then grew pale as death, giving a quick, nervous glance at\nthe quiet figure in black, of which he could just catch a glimpse. Then\ncame the verdict, sharp and decisive, \"NOT GUILTY.\"\n\nOn hearing this a cheer went up from everyone in the court, so strong\nwas the sympathy with Brian.\n\nIn vain the crier of the Court yelled, \"Order!\" until he was red in the\nface. In vain the judge threatened to commit all present for contempt\nof court--his voice being inaudible, it did not matter much--the\nenthusiasm could not be restrained, and it was five minutes before\norder was obtained. The judge, having recovered his composure,\ndelivered his judgment, and discharged the prisoner, in accordance with\nthe verdict.\n\nCalton had won many cases, but it is questionable if he had ever heard\na verdict which gave him so much satisfaction as that which proclaimed\nFitzgerald innocent.\n\nAnd Brian, stepping down from the dock a free man, passed through a\ncrowd of congratulating friends to a small room off the Court, where a\nwoman was waiting for him--a woman who clung round his neck, and sobbed\nout--\n\n\"My darling! My darling! I knew that God would save you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nTHE \"ARGUS\" GIVES ITS OPINION.\n\n\nThe morning after the trial was concluded the following article in\nreference to the matter appeared in the ARGUS:--\n\n\"During the past three months we have frequently in our columns\ncommented on the extraordinary case which is now so widely known as\n'The Hansom Cab Tragedy.' We can safely say that it is the most\nremarkable case which has ever come under the notice of our Criminal\nCourt, and the verdict given by the jury yesterday has enveloped the\nmatter in a still deeper mystery. By a train of strange coincidences,\nMr. Brian Fitzgerald, a young squatter, was suspected of having\nmurdered Whyte, and had it not been for the timely appearance of the\nwoman Rawlins who turned up at the eleventh hour, we feel sure that a\nverdict of guilty would have been given, and an innocent man would have\nsuffered punishment for the crime of another. Fortunately for the\nprisoner, and for the interests of justice, his counsel, Mr. Calton, by\nunwearied diligence, was able to discover the last witness, and prove\nan ALIBI. Had it not been for this, in spite of the remarks made by the\nlearned counsel in his brilliant speech yesterday, which resulted in\nthe acquittal of the prisoner, we question very much if the rest of the\nevidence in favour of the accused would have been sufficient to\npersuade the jury that he was an innocent man. The only points in\nfavour of Mr. Fitzgerald were the inability of the cabman Royston to\nswear to him as the man who had got into the cab with Whyte, the\nwearing of a diamond ring on the forefinger of the right hand (whereas\nMr. Fitzgerald wears no rings), and the difference in time sworn to by\nthe cabman Rankin and the landlady. Against these points, however, the\nprosecution placed a mass of evidence, which seemed conclusively to\nprove the guilt of the prisoner; but the appearance of Sal Rawlins in\nthe witness-box put an end to all doubt. In language which could not be\nmistaken for anything else than the truth, she positively swore that\nMr. Fitzgerald was in one of the slums off Bourke Street, between the\nhours of one and two on Friday morning, at which time the murder was\ncommitted. Under these circumstances, the jury unanimously agreed, and\nreturned a verdict of 'Not guilty,' and the prisoner was forthwith\nacquitted. We have to congratulate his counsel, Mr. Calton, for the\nable speech he made for the defence, and also Mr. Fitzgerald, for his\nprovidential escape from a dishonourable and undeserved punishment. He\nleaves the court without a stain on his character, and with the respect\nand sympathy of all Australians, for the courage and dignity with which\nhe comported himself throughout, while resting under the shadow of such\na serious charge.\n\n\"But now that it has been conclusively proved that he is innocent, the\nquestion arises in every one's mind, 'Who is the murderer of Oliver\nWhyte?' The man who committed this dastardly crime is still at large,\nand, for all we know, may be in our midst. Emboldened by the impunity\nwith which he has escaped the hands of justice, he may be walking\nsecurely down our streets, and talking of the very crime of which he is\nthe perpetrator. Secure in the thought that all traces of him have been\nlost for ever, from the time he alighted from Rankin's cab, at Powlett\nStreet, he has ventured probably to remain in Melbourne, and, for all\nthat anyone knows, he may have been in the court during the late trial.\nNay, this very article, may meet his eye, and he may rejoice at the\nfutile efforts which have been made to find him. But let him beware,\nJustice is not blind, but blind-folded, and when he least expects it,\nshe will tear the bandage from her keen eyes, and drag him forth to the\nlight of day to receive the reward of his deed. Owing to the strong\nevidence against Fitzgerald, that is the only direction in which the\ndetectives have hitherto looked, but baffled on one side, they will\nlook on the other, and this time may be successful.\n\n\"That such a man as the murderer of Oliver Whyte should be at large is\na matter of danger, not only to individual citizens, but to the\ncommunity at large; for it is a well-known fact that a tiger who once\ntastes human blood never overcomes his craving for it; and, without\ndoubt the man who so daringly and coolly murdered a drunken, and\ntherefore defenceless man, will not hesitate to commit a second crime.\nThe present feeling of all classes in Melbourne must be one of terror,\nthat such a man should be at large, and must, in a great measure,\nresemble the fear which filled everyone's heart in London when the Marr\nmurders were committed, and it was known that the murderer had escaped.\nAnyone who has read De Quincy's graphic description of the crime\nperpetrated by Williams must tremble to think that such another devil\nincarnate is in our midst. It is an imperative necessity that such a\nfeeling should be done away with. But how is this to be managed? It is\none thing to speak, and another to act. There seems to be no possible\nclue discoverable at present which can lead to the discovery of the\nreal murderer. The man in the light coat who got out of Rankin's cab at\nPowlett Street, East Melbourne (designedly, as it now appears, in order\nto throw suspicion on Fitzgerald), has vanished as completely as the\nwitches in Macbeth, and left no trace behind. It was two o'clock in the\nmorning when he left the cab, and, in a quiet suburb like East\nMelbourne, no one would be about, so that he could easily escape\nunseen. There seems to be only one chance of ever tracing him, and that\nis to be found in the papers which were stolen from the pocket of the\ndead man. What they were, only two persons knew, and one knows now. The\nfirst two were Whyte and the woman who was called 'The Queen,' and\nboth of them are now dead. The other who knows now is the man who\ncommitted the crime. There can be no doubt that these papers were the\nmotive for the crime, as no money was taken from the pockets of the\ndeceased. The fact, also, that the papers were carried in a pocket made\ninside the waistcoat of the deceased shows that they were of value.\n\n\"Now, the reason we think that the dead woman knew of the existence of\nthese papers is simply this. It appears that she came out from England\nwith Whyte as his mistress, and after staying some time in Sydney came\non to Melbourne. How she came into such a foul and squalid den as that\nshe died in, we are unable to say, unless, seeing that she was given to\ndrink, she was picked up drunk by some Samaritan of the slums, and\ncarried to Mrs. Rawlins' humble abode. Whyte visited her there\nfrequently, but appears to have made no attempt to remove her to a\nbetter place, alleging as his reason that the doctor said she would die\nif taken into the air. Our reporter learned from one of the detectives\nthat the dead woman was in the habit of talking to Whyte about certain\npapers, and on one occasion was overheard to say to him, 'They'll make\nyour fortune if you play your cards well.' This was told to the\ndetective by the woman Rawlins, to whose providential appearance Mr.\nFitzgerald owes his escape. From this it can be gathered that the\npapers--whatever they might be--were of value, and sufficient to tempt\nanother to commit a murder in order to obtain them. Whyte, therefore,\nbeing dead, and his murderer having escaped, the only way of\ndiscovering the secret which lies at the root of this tree of crime, is\nto find out the history of the woman who died in the slum. Traced back\nfor some years, circumstances may be discovered which will reveal what\nthese papers contained, and once that is found, we can confidently say\nthat the murderer will soon be discovered. This is the only chance of\nfinding out the cause, and the author of this mysterious murder; and if\nit fails, we fear the hansom cab tragedy will have to be relegated to\nthe list of undiscovered crimes, and the assassin of Whyte will have no\nother punishment than that of the remorse of his own conscience.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nTHREE MONTHS AFTERWARDS.\n\n\nA hot December day, with a cloudless blue sky, and a sun blazing down\non the earth, clothed in all the beauty of summer garments. Such a\ndescription of snowy December sounds perchance a trifle strange to\nEnglish ears. It may strike them as being somewhat fantastic, as was\nthe play in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\" to Demetrius when he remarked,\n\"This is hot ice and wondrous cold fire.\"\n\nBut here in Australia we are in the realm of contrariety, and many\nthings other than dreams go by contrary. Here black swans are an\nestablished fact, and the proverb concerning them, made when they were\nconsidered as mythical a bird as the Phoenix, has been rendered null\nand void by the discoveries of Captain Cook. Here ironwood sinks and\npumice stone floats, which must strike the curious spectator as a queer\nfreak on the part of Dame Nature. At home the Edinburgh mail bears the\nhardy traveller to a cold climate, with snowy mountains and wintry\nblasts; but here the further north one goes the hotter it gets, till\none arrives in Queensland, where the heat is so great that a profane\ntraveller of an epigrammatic turn of mind once fittingly called it, \"An\namateur hell.\"\n\nBut however contrary, as Mrs. Gamp would say, Nature may be in her\ndealings, the English race out in this great continent are much the\nsame as in the old country--John Bull, Paddy, and Sandy, all being of a\nconservative turn of mind, and with strong opinions as to the keeping\nup of old customs. Therefore, on a hot Christmas day, with the sun one\nhundred odd in the shade, Australian revellers sit down to the roast\nbeef and plum-pudding of Old England, which they eat contentedly as the\northodox thing, and on New Year's Eve the festive Celt repairs to the\ndoors of his \"freends\" with a bottle of whisky and a cheering verse of\nAuld Lang Syne.\n\nStill it is these peculiar customs that give an individuality to a\nnation, and John Bull abroad loses none of his insular obstinacy; but\nkeeps his Christmas in the old fashion, and wears his clothes in the\nnew fashion, without regard to heat or cold. A nation that never\nsurrenders to the fire of an enemy cannot be expected to give in to the\nfire of the sun, but if some ingenious mortal would only invent some\nlight and airy costume, after the fashion of the Greek dress, and\nAustralians would consent to adopt the same, life in Melbourne and her\nsister cities would be much cooler than it is at present.\n\nMadge was thinking somewhat after this fashion as she sat on the wide\nverandah, in a state of exhaustion from the heat, and stared out at the\nwide plains lying parched and arid under the blazing sun. There was a\ndim kind of haze rising from the excessive heat, hanging midway between\nheaven and earth, and through its tremulous veil the distant hills\nlooked aerial and unreal.\n\nStretched out before her was the garden with its intensely vivid\nflowers. To look at them merely was to increase one's caloric\ncondition. Great bushes of oleanders, with their bright pink blossoms,\nluxurious rose trees, with their yellow, red, and white blooms, and all\nalong the border a rainbow of many-coloured flowers, with such\nbrilliant tints that the eye ached to see them in the hot sunshine, and\nturned restfully to the cool green of the trees which encircled the\nlawn. In the centre was a round pool, surrounded by a ring of white\nmarble, and containing a still sheet of water, which flashed like a\nmirror in the blinding light.\n\nThe homestead of Yabba Yallook station was a long low house, with no\nupper-storey, and with a wide verandah running nearly round it. Cool\ngreen blinds were hung between the pillars to keep out the sun, and all\nalong were scattered lounging chairs of basket-work, with rugs, novels,\nempty soda-water bottles, and all the other evidences that Mr.\nFrettlby's guests had been wise, and stayed inside during the noonday\nheat.\n\nMadge was seated in one of these comfortable chairs, and she divided\nher attention between the glowing beauty of the world outside, which\nshe could see through a narrow slit in the blinds. But she did not seem\ngreatly interested in her book, and it was not long before she let it\nfall unheeded to the ground and took refuge in her own thoughts. The\ntrial through which she had so recently passed had been a great one,\nand it had not been without its outward result. It had left its impress\non her beautiful face, and there was a troubled look in her eyes. After\nBrian's acquittal of the murder of Oliver Whyte, she had been taken by\nher father up to the station, in the hope that it would restore her to\nhealth. The mental strain which had been on her during the trial had\nnearly brought on an attack of brain fever; but here, far from the\nexcitement of town life, in the quiet seclusion of the country, she had\nrecovered her health, but not her spirits. Women are more\nimpressionable than men, and it is, perhaps, for this reason that they\nage quicker. A trouble which would pass lightly over a man, leaves an\nindelible mark on a woman, both physically and mentally, and the\nterrible episode of Whyte's murder had changed Madge from a bright and\nmerry girl into a grave and beautiful woman. Sorrow is a potent\nenchantress. Once she touches the heart, life can never be quite the\nsame again. We never more surrender ourselves entirely to pleasure; and\noften we find so many of the things we have longed for are after all\nbut dead sea fruit. Sorrow is the veiled Isis of the world, and once we\npenetrate her mystery and see her deeply-furrowed face and mournful\neyes, the magic light of romance dies all away, and we realise the hard\nbitter fact of life in all its nakedness.\n\nMadge felt something of all this. She saw the world now, not as the\nfantastic fairyland of her girlish dreams, but as the sorrowful vale of\ntears through which we must all walk till we reach the \"Promised Land.\"\n\nAnd Brian, he also had undergone a change, for there were a few white\nhairs now amid his curly, chestnut locks, and his character, from being\ngay and bright, had become moody and irritable. After the trial he had\nleft town immediately, in order to avoid meeting with his friends, and\nhad gone up to his station, which was next to that of the Frettlbys'.\nThere he worked hard all day, and smoked hard all night, thinking over\nthe secret which the dead woman had told him, and which threatened to\novershadow his life. Every now and then he rode over and saw Madge. But\nthis was generally when he knew her father to be away from Melbourne,\nfor of late he had disliked the millionaire. Madge could not but\ncondemn his attitude, remembering how her father had stood beside him\nin his recent trouble. Yet there was another reason why Brian kept\naloof from Yabba Yallook station. He did not wish to meet any of the\ngay society which was there, knowing that since his trial he was an\nobject of curiosity and sympathy to everyone--a position galling enough\nto his proud nature.\n\nAt Christmas time Mr. Frettlby had asked several people up from\nMelbourne, and though Madge would rather have been left alone, yet she\ncould not refuse her father, and had to play hostess with a smiling\nbrow and aching heart.\n\nFelix Rolleston, who a month since had joined the noble army of\nbenedicts, was there with Mrs. Rolleston, NEE Miss Featherweight, who\nruled him with a rod of iron. Having bought Felix with her money, she\nhad determined to make good use of him, and, being ambitious to shine\nin Melbourne society, had insisted upon Felix studying politics, so\nthat when the next general election came round he could enter\nParliament. Felix had rebelled at first, but ultimately gave way, as he\nfound that when he had a good novel concealed among his parliamentary\npapers time passed quite pleasantly, and he got the reputation of a\nhard worker at little cost. They had brought up Julia with them, and\nthis young person had made up her mind to become the second Mrs.\nFrettlby. She had not received much encouragement, but, like the\nEnglish at Waterloo, did not know when she was beaten, and carried on\nthe siege of Mr. Frettlby's heart in an undaunted manner.\n\nDr. Chinston had come up for a little relaxation, and gave never a\nthought to his anxious patients or the many sick-rooms he was in the\nhabit of visiting. A young English fellow, called Peterson, who amused\nhimself by travelling; an old colonist, full of reminiscences of the\nold days, when, \"by gad, sir, we hadn't a gas lamp in the whole of\nMelbourne,\" and several other people, completed the party. They had all\ngone off to the billiard-room, and left Madge in her comfortable chair,\nhalf-asleep.\n\nSuddenly she started, as she heard a step behind her, and turning, saw\nSal Rawlins, in the neatest of black gowns, with a coquettish white cap\nand apron, and an open book. Madge had been so delighted with Sal for\nsaving Brian's life that she had taken her into her service as maid.\nMr. Frettlby had offered strong opposition at first that a fallen woman\nlike Sal should be near his daughter; but Madge was determined to\nrescue the unhappy girl from the life of sin she was leading, and so at\nlast he reluctantly consented. Brian, too, had objected, but ultimately\nyielded, as he saw that Madge had set her heart on it. Mother\nGuttersnipe objected at first, characterising the whole affair as\n\"cussed 'umbug,\" but she, likewise, gave in, and Sal became maid to\nMiss Frettlby, who immediately set to work to remedy Sal's defective\neducation by teaching her to read. The book she held in her hand was a\nspelling-book, and this she handed to Madge.\n\n\"I think I knows it now, miss,\" she said, respectfully, as Madge looked\nup with a smile.\n\n\"Do you, indeed?\" said Madge, gaily. \"You will be able to read in no\ntime, Sal.\"\n\n\"Read this?\" said Sal, touching \"Tristan: A Romance, by Zoe.\"\n\n\"Hardly!\" said Madge, picking it up, with a look of contempt.\n\n\"I want you to learn English, and not a confusion of tongues like this\nthing. But it's too hot for lessons, Sal,\" she went on, leaning back in\nher seat, \"so get a chair and talk to me.\"\n\nSal complied, and Madge looked out at the brilliant flower-beds, and at\nthe black shadow of the tall witch elm which grew on one side of the\nlawn. She wanted to ask a certain question of Sal, and did not know how\nto do it. The moodiness and irritability of Brian had troubled her very\nmuch of late, and, with the quick instinct of her sex, she ascribed it\nindirectly to the woman who had died in the back slum. Anxious to share\nhis troubles and lighten his burden, she determined to ask Sal about\nthis mysterious woman, and find out, if possible, what secret had been\ntold to Brian which affected him so deeply.\n\n\"Sal,\" she said, after a short pause, turning her clear grey eyes on\nthe woman, \"I want to ask you something.\"\n\nThe other shivered and turned pale.\n\n\"About--about that?\"\n\nMadge nodded.\n\nSal hesitated for a moment, and then flung herself at the feet of her\nmistress.\n\n\"I will tell you,\" she cried. \"You have been kind to me, an' have a\nright to know. I will tell you all I know.\"\n\n\"Then,\" asked Madge, firmly, as she clasped her hands tightly together,\n\"who was this woman whom Mr. Fitzgerald went to see, and where did she\ncome from?\"\n\n\"Gran' an' me found her one evenin' in Little Bourke Street,\" answered\nSal, \"just near the theatre. She was quite drunk, an' we took her home\nwith us.\"\n\n\"How kind of you,\" said Madge.\n\n\"Oh, it wasn't that,\" replied the other, dryly. \"Gran' wanted her\nclothes; she was awful swell dressed.\"\n\n\"And she took the clothes--how wicked!\"\n\n\"Anyone would have done it down our way,\" answered Sal, indifferently;\n\"but Gran' changed her mind when she got her home. I went out to get\nsome gin for Gran', and when I came back she was huggin' and kissin'\nthe woman.\"\n\n\"She recognised her.\"\n\n\"Yes, I s'pose so,\" replied Sal, \"an' next mornin', when the lady got\nsquare, she made a grab at Gran', an' hollered out, 'I was comin' to\nsee you.'\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Gran' chucked me out of the room, an' they had a long jaw; and then,\nwhen I come back, Gran' tells me the lady is a-goin' to stay with us\n'cause she was ill, and sent me for Mr. Whyte.\"\n\n\"And he came?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--often,\" said Sal. \"He kicked up a row when he first turned\nup, but when he found she was ill, he sent a doctor; but it warn't no\ngood. She was two weeks with us, and then died the mornin' she saw Mr.\nFitzgerald.\"\n\n\"I suppose Mr. Whyte was in the habit of talking to this woman?\"\n\n\"Lots,\" returned Sal; \"but he always turned Gran' an' me out of the\nroom afore he started.\"\n\n\"And\"--hesitating--\"did you ever overhear one of these conversations?\"\n\n\"Yes--one,\" answered the other, with a nod. \"I got riled at the way he\ncleared us out of our own room; and once, when he shut the door and\nGran' went off to get some gin, I sat down at the door and listened. He\nwanted her to give up some papers, an' she wouldn't. She said she'd die\nfirst; but at last he got 'em, and took 'em away with him.\"\n\n\"Did you see them?\" asked Madge, as the assertion of Gorby that Whyte\nhad been murdered for certain papers flashed across her mind.\n\n\"Rather,\" said Sal, \"I was looking through a hole in the door, an' she\ntakes 'em from under her piller, an' 'e takes 'em to the table, where\nthe candle was, an' looks at 'em--they were in a large blue envelop,\nwith writing on it in red ink--then he put 'em in his pocket, and she\nsings out: 'You'll lose 'em,' an' 'e says: 'No, I'll always 'ave 'em\nwith me, an' if 'e wants 'em 'e'll have to kill me fust afore 'e gits\n'em.'\"\n\n\"And you did not know who the man was to whom the papers were of such\nimportance?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't; they never said no names.\"\n\n\"And when was it Whyte got the papers?\"\n\n\"About a week before he was murdered,\" said Sal, after a moment's\nthought. \"An' after that he never turned up again. She kept watchin'\nfor him night an' day, an' 'cause he didn't come, got mad at him. I\nhear her sayin', 'You think you've done with me, my gentleman, an'\nleaves me here to die, but I'll spoil your little game,' an' then she\nwrote that letter to Mr. Fitzgerald, an' I brought him to her, as you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Madge, rather impatiently. \"I heard all that at the\ntrial, but what conversation passed between Mr. Fitzgerald and this\nwoman? Did you hear it?\"\n\n\"Bits of it,\" replied the other. \"I didn't split in Court, 'cause I\nthought the lawyer would be down on me for listening. The first thing I\nheard Mr. Fitzgerald sayin' was, 'You're mad--it ain't true,' an' she\nses, 'S'elp me it is, Whyte's got the proof,' an' then he sings out,\n'My poor girl,' and she ses, 'Will you marry her now?' and ses he, 'I\nwill, I love her more than ever;' and then she makes a grab at him, and\nsays, 'Spile his game if you can,' and says he, 'What's yer name?' and\nshe says--\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Madge, breathlessly.\n\n\"Rosanna Moore!\"\n\nThere was a sharp exclamation as Sal said the name, and, turning round\nquickly, Madge found Brian standing beside her, pale as death, with his\neyes fixed on the woman, who had risen to her feet.\n\n\"Go on!\" he said sharply.\n\n\"That's all I know,\" she replied, in a sullen tone. Brian gave a sigh\nof relief.\n\n\"You can go,\" he said slowly; \"I wish to speak with Miss Frettlby\nalone.\"\n\nSal looked at him for a moment, and then glanced at her mistress, who\nnodded to her as a sign that she might withdraw. She picked up her\nbook, and with another sharp enquiring look at Brian, turned and walked\nslowly into the house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nA DAUGHTER OF EVE.\n\n\nAfter Sal had gone, Brian sank into a chair beside Madge with a weary\nsigh. He was in riding dress, which became his stalwart figure well,\nand he looked remarkably handsome but ill and worried.\n\n\"What on earth were you questioning that girl about?\" he said abruptly,\ntaking his hat off, and tossing it and his gloves on to the floor.\n\nMadge flushed crimson for a moment, and then taking Brian's two strong\nhands in her own, looked steadily into his frowning face.\n\n\"Why don't you trust me?\" she asked, in a quiet tone.\n\n\"It is not necessary that I should,\" he answered moodily. \"The secret\nthat Rosanna Moore told me on her death-bed is nothing that would\nbenefit you to know.\"\n\n\"Is it about me?\" she persisted.\n\n\"It is, and it is not,\" he answered, epigrammatically.\n\n\"I suppose that means that it is about a third person, and concerns\nme,\" she said calmly, releasing his hands.\n\n\"Well, yes,\" impatiently striking his boot with his riding whip. \"But\nit is nothing that can harm you so long as you do not know it; but God\nhelp you should anyone tell it to you, for it would embitter your life.\"\n\n\"My life being so very sweet now,\" answered Madge, with a slight sneer.\n\"You are trying to put out a fire by pouring oil on it, and what you\nsay only makes me more determined to learn what it is.\"\n\n\"Madge, I implore you not to persist in this foolish curiosity,\" he\nsaid, almost fiercely, \"it will bring you only misery.\"\n\n\"If it concerns me I have a right to know it,\" she answered curtly.\n\"When I marry you how can we be happy together, with the shadow of a\nsecret between us?\"\n\nBrian rose, and leaned against the verandah post with a dark frown on\nhis face.\n\n\"Do you remember that verse of Browning's,\" he said, coolly--\n\n  'Where the apple reddens Never pry,\n  Lest we lose our Edens, Eve and I.'\n\n\n\"Singularly applicable to our present conversation, I think.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" she said, her pale face flushing with anger, \"you want me to live\nin a fool's paradise, which may end at any moment.\"\n\n\"That depends upon yourself,\" he answered coldly. \"I never roused your\ncuriosity by telling you that there was a secret, but betrayed it\ninadvertently to Calton's cross-questioning. I tell you candidly that I\ndid learn something from Rosanna Moore, and it concerns you, though\nonly indirectly through a third person. But it would do no good to\nreveal it, and would ruin both our lives.\"\n\nShe did not answer, but looked straight before her into the glowing\nsunshine.\n\nBrian fell on his knees beside her, and stretched out his hands with an\nentreating gesture.\n\n\"Oh, my darling,\" he cried sadly, \"cannot you trust me? The love which\nhas stood such a test as yours cannot fail like this. Let me bear the\nmisery of knowing it alone, without blighting your young life with the\nknowledge of it. I would tell you if I could, but, God help me, I\ncannot--I cannot,\" and he buried his face in his hands.\n\nMadge closed her mouth firmly, and touched his comely head with her\ncool, white fingers. There was a struggle going on in her breast\nbetween her feminine curiosity and her love for the man at her\nfeet--the latter conquered, and she bowed her head over his.\n\n\"Brian,\" she whispered softly, \"let it be as you wish. I will never\nagain try to learn this secret, since you do not desire it.\"\n\nHe arose to his feet, and caught her in his strong arms, with a glad\nsmile.\n\n\"My dearest,\" he said, kissing her passionately, and then for a few\nmoments neither of them spoke. \"We will begin a new life,\" he said, at\nlength. \"We will put the sad past away from us, and think of it only as\na dream.\"\n\n\"But this secret will still fret you,\" she murmured.\n\n\"It will wear away with time and with change of scene,\" he answered\nsadly.\n\n\"Change of scene!\" she repeated in a startled tone. \"Are you going\naway?\"\n\n\"Yes; I have sold my station, and intend leaving Australia for ever\nduring the next three months.\"\n\n\"And where are you going?\" asked the girl, rather bewildered.\n\n\"Anywhere,\" he said a little bitterly. \"I am going to follow the\nexample of Cain, and be a wanderer on the face of the earth!\"\n\n\"Alone!\"\n\n\"That is what I have come to see you about,\" said Brian, looking\nsteadily at her. \"I have come to ask you if you will marry me at once,\nand we will leave Australia together.\"\n\nShe hesitated.\n\n\"I know it is asking a great deal,\" he said, hurriedly, \"to leave your\nfriends, your position, and\"--with hesitation--\"your father; but think\nof my life without you--think how lonely I shall be, wandering round\nthe world by myself; but you will not desert me now I have so much need\nof you--you will come with me and be my good angel in the future as you\nhave been in the past?\"\n\nShe put her hand on his arm, and looking at him with her clear, grey\neyes, said--\"Yes!\"\n\n\"Thank God for that,\" said Brian, reverently, and there was again a\nsilence.\n\nThen they sat down and talked about their plans, and built castles in\nthe air, after the fashion of lovers.\n\n\"I wonder what papa will say?\" observed Madge, idly twisting her\nengagement ring round and round.\n\nBrian frowned, and a dark look passed over his face.\n\n\"I suppose I must speak to him about it?\" he said at length,\nreluctantly.\n\n\"Yes, of course!\" she replied, lightly. \"It is merely a formality;\nstill, one that must be observed.\"\n\n\"And where is Mr. Frettlby?\" asked Fitzgerald, rising.\n\n\"In the billiard-room,\" she answered, as she followed his example.\n\"No!\" she continued, as she saw her father step on to the verandah.\n\"Here he is.\"\n\nBrian had not seen Mark Frettlby for some time, and was astonished at\nthe change which had taken place in his appearance. Formerly, he had\nbeen as straight as an arrow, with a stern, fresh-coloured face; but\nnow he had a slight stoop, and his face looked old and withered. His\nthick, black hair was streaked here and there with white. His eyes\nalone were unchanged. They were as keen and bright as ever. Brian knew\nfull well how he himself had altered. He knew, too, that Madge was not\nthe same, and now he could not but wonder whether the great change that\nwas apparent in her father was attributable to the same source--to the\nmurder of Oliver Whyte.\n\nSad and thoughtful as Mr. Frettlby looked, as he came along, a smile\nbroke over his face as he caught sight of his daughter.\n\n\"My dear Fitzgerald,\" he said, holding out his hand, \"this is indeed a\nsurprise! When did you come over?\"\n\n\"About half-an-hour ago,\" replied Brian, reluctantly, taking the\nextended hand of the millionaire. \"I came to see Madge, and have a talk\nwith you.\"\n\n\"Ah! that's right,\" said the other, putting his arm round his\ndaughter's waist. \"So that's what has brought the roses to your face,\nyoung lady?\" he went on, pinching her cheek playfully. \"You will stay\nto dinner, of course, Fitzgerald?\"\n\n\"Thank you, no!\" answered Brian, hastily, \"my dress--\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" interrupted Frettlby, hospitably; \"we are not in Melbourne,\nand I am sure Madge will excuse your dress. You must stay.\"\n\n\"Yes, do,\" said Madge, in a beseeching tone, touching his hand lightly.\n\"I don't see so much of you that I can let you off with half-an-hour's\nconversation.\"\n\nBrian seemed to be making a violent effort.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said in a low voice; \"I shall stay.\"\n\n\"And now,\" said Frettlby, in a brisk tone, as he sat down; \"the\nimportant question of dinner being settled, what is it you want to see\nme about?--Your station?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Brian, leaning against the verandah post, while Madge\nslipped her hand through his arm. \"I have sold it.\"\n\n\"Sold it!\" echoed Frettlby, aghast. \"What for?\"\n\n\"I felt restless, and wanted a change.\"\n\n\"Ah! a rolling stone,\" said the millionaire, shaking his head, \"gathers\nno moss, you know.\"\n\n\"Stones don't roll of their own accord,\" replied Brian, in a gloomy\ntone. \"They are impelled by a force over which they have no control.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said the millionaire, in a joking tone. \"And may I ask\nwhat is your propelling force?\"\n\nBrian looked at the man's face with such a steady gaze that the\nlatter's eyes dropped after an uneasy attempt to return it.\n\n\"Well,\" he said impatiently, looking at the two tall young people\nstanding before him, \"what do you want to see me about?\"\n\n\"Madge has agreed to marry me at once, and I want your consent.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" said Frettlby, curtly.\n\n\"There is no such a word as impossible,\" retorted Brian, coolly,\nthinking of the famous remark in RICHELIEU, \"Why should you refuse? I\nam rich now.\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" said Frettlby, rising impatiently. \"It's not money I'm\nthinking about--I've got enough for both of you; but I cannot live\nwithout Madge.\"\n\n\"Then come with us,\" said his daughter, kissing him.\n\nHer lover, however, did not second the invitation, but stood moodily\ntwisting his tawny moustache, and staring out into the garden in an\nabsent sort of manner.\n\n\"What do you say, Fitzgerald?\" said Frettlby, who was eyeing him keenly.\n\n\"Oh, delighted, of course,\" answered Brian, confusedly.\n\n\"In that case,\" returned the other, coolly, \"I will tell you what we\nwill do. I have bought a steam yacht, and she will be ready for sea\nabout the end of January. You will marry my daughter at once, and go\nround New Zealand for your honeymoon. When you return, if I feel\ninclined, and you two turtle-doves don't object, I will join you, and\nwe will make a tour of the world.\"\n\n\"Oh, how delightful,\" cried Madge, clasping her hands. \"I am so fond of\nthe ocean with a companion, of course,\" she added, with a saucy glance\nat her lover.\n\nBrian's face had brightened considerably, for he was a born sailor, and\na pleasant yachting voyage in the blue waters of the Pacific, with\nMadge as his companion, was, to his mind, as near Paradise as any\nmortal could get.\n\n\"And what is, the name of the yacht?\" he asked, with deep interest.\n\n\"Her name?\" repeated Mr. Frettlby, hastily. \"Oh, a very ugly name, and\none which I intend to change. At present she is called the 'Rosanna.'\"\n\n\"Rosanna!\"\n\nBrian and his betrothed both started at this, and the former stared\ncuriously at the old man, wondering at the coincidence between the name\nof the yacht and that of the woman who died in the Melbourne slum.\n\nMr Frettlby flushed a little when he saw Brian's eye fixed on him with\nsuch an enquiring gaze, and rose with an embarrassed laugh.\n\n\"You are a pair of moon-struck lovers,\" he said, gaily, taking an arm\nof each, and leading them into the house \"but you forget dinner will\nsoon be ready.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nACROSS THE WALNUTS AND THE WINE.\n\n\nMoore, sweetest of bards, sings--\n\n  \"Oh, there's nothing half so sweet in life\n  As love's young dream.\"\n\n\nBut he made this assertion in his callow days, before he had learned\nthe value of a good digestion. To a young and fervid youth, love's\nyoung dream is, no doubt, very charming, lovers, as a rule, having a\nsmall appetite; but to a man who has seen the world, and drunk deeply\nof the wine of life, there is nothing half so sweet in the whole of his\nexistence as a good dinner. \"A hard heart and a good digestion will\nmake any man happy.\" So said Talleyrand, a cynic if you like, but a man\nwho knew the temper of his day and generation. Ovid wrote about the art\nof love--Brillat Savarin, of the art of dining; yet, I warrant you, the\ngastronomical treatise of the brilliant Frenchman is more widely read\nthan the passionate songs of the Roman poet. Who does not value as the\nsweetest in the whole twenty-four the hour when, seated at an\nartistically-laid table, with delicately-cooked viands, good wines, and\npleasant company, all the cares and worries of the day give place to a\ndelightful sense of absolute enjoyment? Dinner with the English people\nis generally a very dreary affair, and there is a heaviness about the\nwhole thing which communicates itself to the guests, who eat and drink\nwith a solemn persistence, as though they were occupied in fulfilling\nsome sacred rite. But there are men--alas! few and far between--who\npossess the rare art of giving good dinners--good in the sense of\nsociality as well as in that of cookery.\n\nMark Frettlby was one of these rare individuals--he had an innate\ngenius for getting pleasant people together--people, who, so to speak,\ndovetailed into one another. He had an excellent cook, and his wines\nwere irreproachable, so that Brian, in spite of his worries, was glad\nthat he had accepted the invitation. The bright gleam of the silver,\nthe glitter of glass, and the perfume of flowers, all collected under\nthe subdued crimson glow of a pink-shaded lamp, which hung from the\nceiling, could not but give him a pleasurable sensation.\n\nOn one side of the dining-room were the French windows opening on to\nthe verandah, and beyond appeared the vivid green of the trees, and the\ndazzling colours of the flowers, somewhat tempered by the soft hazy\nglow of the twilight.\n\nBrian had made himself as respectable as possible under the odd\ncircumstances of dining in his riding-dress, and sat next to Madge,\ncontentedly sipping his wine, and listening to the pleasant chatter\nwhich was going on around him.\n\nFelix Rolleston was in great spirits, the more so as Mrs. Rolleston was\nat the further end of the table, hidden from his view.\n\nJulia Featherweight sat near Mr. Frettlby, and chatted to him so\npersistently that he wished she would become possessed of a dumb devil.\n\nDr. Chinston and Peterson were seated on the other side of the table,\nand the old colonist, whose name was Valpy, had the post of honour, on\nMr. Frettlby's right hand.\n\nThe conversation had turned on to the subject, ever green and\nfascinating, of politics, and Mr. Rolleston thought it a good\nopportunity to air his views as to the Government of the Colony, and to\nshow his wife that he really meant to obey her wish, and become a power\nin the political world.\n\n\"By Jove, you know,\" he said, with a wave of his hand, as though he\nwere addressing the House; \"the country is going to the dogs, and all\nthat sort of thing. What we want is a man like Beaconsfield.\"\n\n\"Ah! but you can't pick up a man like that every day,\" said Frettlby,\nwho was listening with an amused smile to Rolleston's disquisitions.\n\n\"Rather a good thing, too,\" observed Dr. Chinston, dryly.\n\n\"Genius would become too common.\"\n\n\"Well, when I am elected,\" said Felix, who had his own views, which\nmodesty forbade him to publish, on the subject of the coming colonial\nDisraeli, \"I probably shall form a party.\"\n\n\"To advocate what?\" asked Peterson, curiously.\n\n\"Oh, well, you see,\" hesitated Felix, \"I haven't drawn up a programme\nyet, so can't say at present.\"\n\n\"Yes, you can hardly give a performance without a programme,\" said the\ndoctor, taking a sip of wine, and then everybody laughed.\n\n\"And on what are your political opinions founded?\" asked Mr. Frettlby,\nabsently, without looking at Felix.\n\n\"Oh, you see, I've read the Parliamentary reports and Constitutional\nhistory, and--and Vivian Grey,\" said Felix, who began to feel himself\nsomewhat at sea.\n\n\"The last of which is what the author called it, a LUSUS NATURAE,\"\nobserved Chinston. \"Don't erect your political schemes on such bubble\nfoundations as are in that novel, for you won't find a Marquis Carabas\nout here.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, no!\" observed Felix, mournfully; \"but we may find a\nVivian Grey.\"\n\nEvery one smothered a smile, the allusion was so patent.\n\n\"Well, he didn't succeed in the end,\" cried Peterson.\n\n\"Of course he didn't,\" retorted Felix, disdainfully; \"he made an enemy\nof a woman, and a man who is such a fool as to do that deserves to\nfall.\"\n\n\"You have an excellent opinion of our sex, Mr. Rolleston,\" said Madge,\nwith a wicked glance at the wife of that gentleman, who was listening\ncomplacently to her husband's aimless chatter.\n\n\"No better than they deserve,\" replied Rolleston, gallantly.\n\n\"But you have never gone in for politics, Mr. Frettlby?\"\n\n\"Who?--I--no,\" said the host, rousing himself out of the brown study\ninto which he had fallen. \"I'm afraid I'm not sufficiently patriotic,\nand my business did not permit me.\"\n\n\"And now?\"\n\n\"Now,\" echoed Mr. Frettlby, glancing at his daughter, \"I intend to\ntravel.\"\n\n\"The jolliest thing out,\" said Peterson, eagerly. \"One never gets tired\nof seeing the queer things that are in the world.\"\n\n\"I've seen queer enough things in Melbourne in the early days,\" said\nthe old colonist, with a wicked twinkle in his eyes.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Julia, putting her hands up to her ears, \"don't tell me\nthem, for I'm sure they're naughty.\"\n\n\"We weren't saints then,\" said old Valpy, with a senile chuckle.\n\n\"Ah, then, we haven't changed much in that respect,\" retorted Frettlby,\ndrily.\n\n\"You talk of your theatres now,\" went on Valpy, with the garrulousness\nof old age; \"why, you haven't got a dancer like Rosanna.\"\n\nBrian started on hearing this name again, and he felt Madge's cold hand\ntouch his.\n\n\"And who was Rosanna?\" asked Felix, curiously, looking up.\n\n\"A dancer and burlesque actress,\" replied Valpy, vivaciously, nodding\nhis old head. \"Such a beauty; we were all mad about her--such hair and\neyes. You remember her, Frettlby?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the host, in a curiously dry voice.\n\nBut before Mr. Valpy had the opportunity to wax more eloquent, Madge\nrose from the table, and the other ladies followed. The ever polite\nFelix held the door open for them, and received a bright smile from his\nwife for, what she considered, his brilliant talk at the dinner table.\n\nBrian sat still, and wondered why Frettlby changed colour on hearing\nthe name--he supposed that the millionaire had been mixed up with the\nactress, and did not care about being reminded of his early\nindiscretions--and, after all, who does?\n\n\"She was as light as a fairy,\" continued Valpy, with wicked chuckle.\n\n\"What became of her?\" asked Brian, abruptly.\n\nMark Frettlby looked up suddenly, as Fitzgerald asked this question.\n\n\"She went to England in 1858,\" said the aged one. \"I'm not quite sure\nif it was July or August, but it was in 1858.\"\n\n\"You will excuse me, Valpy, but I hardly think that these reminiscences\nof a ballet-dancer are amusing,\" said Frettlby, curtly, pouring himself\nout a glass of wine. \"Let us change the subject.\"\n\nNotwithstanding the plainly-expressed wish of his host Brian felt\nstrongly inclined to pursue the conversation. Politeness, however,\nforbade such a thing, and he consoled himself with the reflection that,\nafter dinner, he would ask old Valpy about the ballet-dancer whose name\ncaused Mark Frettlby to exhibit such strong emotion. But, to his\nannoyance, when the gentlemen went into the drawing-room, Frettlby took\nthe old colonist off to his study, where he sat with him the whole\nevening talking over old times.\n\nFitzgerald found Madge seated at the piano in the drawing-room playing\none of Mendelssohn's Songs without Words.\n\n\"What a dismal thing that is you are playing, Madge,\" he said lightly,\nas he sank into a seat beside her. \"It is more like a funeral march\nthan anything else.\"\n\n\"Gad, so it is,\" said Felix, who came up at this moment. \"I don't care\nmyself about 'Op. 84' and all that classical humbug. Give me something\nlight--'Belle Helene,' with Emelie Melville, and all that sort of\nthing.\"\n\n\"Felix!\" said his wife, in a stern tone.\n\n\"My dear,\" he answered recklessly, rendered bold by the champagne he\nhad taken, \"you observed--\"\n\n\"Nothing particular,\" answered Mrs. Rolleston, glancing at him with a\nstony eye, \"except that I consider Offenbach low.\"\n\n\"I don't,\" said Felix, sitting down to the piano, from which Madge had\njust risen, \"and to prove he ain't, here goes.\"\n\nHe ran his fingers lightly over the keys, and dashed into a brilliant\nOffenbach galop, which had the effect of waking up the people in the\ndrawing-room, who felt sleepy after dinner, and sent the blood tingling\nthrough their veins. When they were thoroughly roused, Felix, now that\nhe had an appreciative audience, for he was by no means an individual\nwho believed in wasting his sweetness on the desert air, prepared to\namuse them.\n\n\"You haven't heard the last new song by Frosti, have you?\" he asked,\nafter he had brought his galop to a conclusion.\n\n\"Is that the composer of 'Inasmuch' and 'How so?'\" asked Julia,\nclasping her hands. \"I do love his music, and the words are so sweetly\npretty.\"\n\n\"Infernally stupid, she means,\" whispered Peterson to Brian. \"They've\nno more meaning in them than the titles.\"\n\n\"Sing us the new song, Felix,\" commanded his wife, and her obedient\nhusband obeyed her.\n\nIt was entitled, \"Somewhere,\" words by Vashti, music by Paola Frosti,\nand was one of those extraordinary compositions which may mean\nanything--that is, if the meaning can be discovered. Felix had a\npleasant voice, though it was not very strong, and the music was\npretty, while the words were mystical. The first verse was as follows:--\n\n  \"A flying cloud, a breaking wave,\n  A faint light in a moonless sky:\n  A voice that from the silent grave\n  Sounds sad in one long bitter cry.\n  I know not, sweet, where you may stand,\n  With shining eyes and golden hair,\n  Yet I know, I will touch your hand\n  And kiss your lips somewhere--\n  Somewhere! Somewhere!--\n  When the summer sun is fair,\n  Waiting me, on land or sea,\n  Somewhere, love, somewhere!\"\n\n\nThe second verse was very similar to the first, and when Felix finished\na murmur of applause broke from every one of the ladies.\n\n\"How sweetly pretty,\" sighed Julia. \"Such a lot in it.\"\n\n\"But what is its meaning?\" asked Brian, rather bewildered.\n\n\"It hasn't got one,\" replied Felix, complacently. \"Surely you don't\nwant every song to have a moral, like a book of Aesop's Fables?\"\n\nBrian shrugged his shoulders, and turned away with Madge.\n\n\"I must say I agree with Fitzgerald,\" said the doctor, quickly. \"I like\na song with some meaning in it. The poetry of the one you sang is as\nmystical as Browning, without any of his genius to redeem it.\"\n\n\"Philistine,\" murmured Felix, under his breath, and then vacated his\nseat at the piano in favour of Julia, who was about to sing a ballad\ncalled, \"Going Down the Hill,\" which had been the rage in Melbourne\nmusical circles during the last two months.\n\nMeanwhile Madge and Brian were walking up and down in the moonlight. It\nwas an exquisite night, with a cloudless blue sky glittering with the\nstars, and a great yellow moon in the west. Madge seated herself on the\nside of the marble ledge which girdled the still pool of water in front\nof the house, and dipped her hand into the cool water. Brian leaned\nagainst the trunk of a great magnolia tree, whose glossy green leaves\nand great creamy blossoms looked fantastic in the moonlight. In front\nof them was the house, with the ruddy lamplight streaming through the\nwide windows, and they could see the guests within, excited by the\nmusic, waltzing to Rolleston's playing, and their dark figures kept\npassing and re-passing the windows while the charming music of the\nwaltz mingled with their merry laughter.\n\n\"Looks like a haunted house,\" said Brian, thinking of Poe's weird poem;\n\"but such a thing is impossible out here.\"\n\n\"I don't know so much about that,\" said Madge, gravely, lifting up some\nwater in the palm of her hand, and letting it stream back like diamonds\nin the moonlight. \"I knew a house in St. Kilda which was haunted.\"\n\n\"By what?\" asked Brian, sceptically.\n\n\"Noises!\" she answered, solemnly.\n\nBrian burst out laughing and startled a bat, which flew round and\nround in the silver moonlight, and whirred away into the shelter of a\nwitch elm.\n\n\"Rats and mice are more common here than ghosts,\" he said, lightly.\n\"I'm afraid the inhabitants of your haunted house were fanciful.\"\n\n\"So you don't believe in ghosts?\"\n\n\"There's a Banshee in our family,\" said Brian, with a gay smile, \"who\nis supposed to cheer our death beds with her howlings; but as I've\nnever seen the lady myself, I'm afraid she's a Mrs. Harris.\"\n\n\"It's aristocratic to have a ghost in a family, I believe,\" said Madge;\n\"that is the reason we colonials have none.\"\n\n\"Ah, but you will have,\" he answered with a careless laugh. \"There are,\nno doubt, democratic as well as aristocratic ghosts; but, pshaw!\" he\nwent on, impatiently, \"what nonsense I talk. There are no ghosts,\nexcept of a man's own raising. The ghosts of a dead youth--the ghosts\nof past follies--the ghosts of what might have been--these are the\nspectres which are more to be feared than those of the churchyard.\"\n\nMadge looked at him in silence, for she understood the meaning of that\npassionate outburst--the secret which the dead woman had told him, and\nwhich hung like a shadow over his life. She arose quietly and took his\narm. The light touch roused him, and a faint wind sent an eerie rustle\nthrough the still leaves of the magnolia, as they walked back in\nsilence to the house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nBRIAN RECEIVES A LETTER.\n\n\nNotwithstanding the hospitable invitation of Mr. Frettlby, Brian\nrefused to stay at Yabba Yallook that night, but after saying good-bye\nto Madge, mounted his horse and rode slowly away in the moonlight. He\nfelt very happy, and letting the reins lie on his horse's neck, he gave\nhimself up unreservedly to his thoughts. ATRA CURA certainly did not\nsit behind the horseman on this night; and Brian, to his surprise,\nfound himself singing \"Kitty of Coleraine,\" as he rode along in the\nsilver moonlight. And was he not right to sing when the future seemed\nso bright and pleasant? Oh, yes! they would live on the ocean, and she\nwould find how much pleasanter it was on the restless waters, with\ntheir solemn sense of mystery, than on the crowded land.\n\n\n  \"Was not the sea\n  Made for the free--\n  Land for courts and slaves alone?\"\n\n\nMoore was perfectly right. She would learn that when with a fair wind,\nand all sail set, they were flying over the blue Pacific waters.\n\nAnd then they would go home to Ireland to the ancestral home of the\nFitzgeralds, where he would lead her in under the arch, with \"CEAD\nMILLE FAILTHE\" on it, and everyone would bless the fair young bride.\nWhy should he trouble himself about the crime of another? No! He had\nmade a resolve, and intended to keep it; he would put this secret with\nwhich he had been entrusted behind his back, and would wander about the\nworld with Madge and--her father. He felt a sudden chill come over him\nas he murmured the last words to himself \"her father.\"\n\n\"I'm a fool,\" he said, impatiently, as he gathered up the reins, and\nspurred his horse into a canter. \"It can make no difference to me so\nlong as Madge remains ignorant; but to sit beside him, to eat with him,\nto have him always present like a skeleton at a feast--God help me!\"\n\nHe urged his horse into a gallop, and as he rushed over the turf, with\nthe fresh, cool night wind blowing keenly against his face, he felt a\nsense of relief, as though he were leaving some dark spectre behind. On\nhe galloped, with the blood throbbing in his young veins, over miles of\nplain, with the dark-blue, star-studded sky above, and the pale moon\nshining down on him--past a silent shepherd's hut, which stood near a\nwide creek; splashing through the cool water, which wound through the\ndark plain like a thread of silver in the moonlight--then, again, the\nwide, grassy plain, dotted here and there with tall clumps of shadowy\ntrees, and on either side he could see the sheep skurrying away like\nfantastic spectres--on--on--ever on, until his own homestead appears,\nand he sees the star-like light shining brightly in the distance--a\nlong avenue of tall trees, over whose wavering shadows his horse\nthundered, and then the wide grassy space in front of the house, with\nthe clamorous barking of dogs. A groom, roused by the clatter of hoofs\nup the avenue, comes round the side of the house, and Brian leaps off\nhis horse, and flinging the reins to the man, walks into his own room.\nThere he finds a lighted lamp, brandy and soda on the table, and a\npacket of letters and newspapers. He flung his hat on the sofa, and\nopened the window and door, so as to let in the cool breeze; then\nmixing for himself a glass of brandy and soda, he turned up the lamp,\nand prepared to read his letters. The first he took up was from a lady.\n\"Always a she correspondent for me,\" says Isaac Disraeli, \"provided she\ndoes not cross.\" Brian's correspondence did not cross, but\nnotwithstanding this, after reading half a page of small talk and\nscandal, he flung the letter on the table with an impatient\nejaculation. The other letters were principally business ones, but the\nlast one proved to be from Calton, and Fitzgerald opened it with a\nsensation of pleasure. Calton was a capital letter-writer, and his\nepistles had done much to cheer Fitzgerald in the dismal period which\nsucceeded his acquittal of Whyte's murder, when he was in danger of\ngetting into a morbid state of mind. Brian, therefore, sipped his\nbrandy and soda, and, lying back in his chair, prepared to enjoy\nhimself.\n\n\"My dear Fitzgerald,\" wrote Calton his peculiarly clear handwriting,\nwhich was such an exception to the usual crabbed hieroglyphics of his\nbrethren of the bar, \"while you are enjoying the cool breezes and\ndelightful freshness of the country, here am I, with numerous other\npoor devils, cooped up in this hot and dusty city. How I wish I were\nwith you in the land of Goschen, by the rolling waters of the Murray,\nwhere everything is bright and green, and unsophisticated--the two\nlatter terms are almost identical--instead of which my view is bounded\nby bricks and mortar, and the muddy waters of the Yarra have to do duty\nfor your noble river. Ah! I too have lived in Arcadia, but I don't now:\nand even if some power gave me the choice to go back again, I am not\nsure that I would accept. Arcadia, after all, is a lotus-eating\nParadise of blissful ignorance, and I love the world with its pomps,\nvanities, and wickedness. While you, therefore, oh Corydon--don't be\nafraid, I'm not going to quote Virgil--are studying Nature's book, I am\ndeep in the musty leaves of Themis' volume, but I dare say that the\ngreat mother teaches you much better things than her artificial\ndaughter does me. However, you remember that pithy proverb, 'When one\nis in Rome, one must not speak ill of the Pope,' so being in the legal\nprofession, I must respect its muse. I suppose when you saw that this\nletter came from a law office, you wondered what the deuce a lawyer was\nwriting to you for, and my handwriting, no doubt suggested a\nwrit--pshaw! I am wrong there, you are past the age of writs--not that\nI hint that you are old; by no means--you are just at that appreciative\nage when a man enjoys life most, when the fire of youth is tempered by\nthe experience of age, and one knows how to enjoy to the utmost the\ngood things of this world, videlicet--love, wine, and friendship. I am\nafraid I am growing poetical, which is a bad thing for a lawyer, for\nthe flower of poetry cannot flourish in the arid wastes of the law. On\nreading what I have written, I find I have been as discursive as\nPraed's Vicar, and as this letter is supposed to be a business one, I\nmust deny myself the luxury of following out a train of idle ideas, and\nwrite sense. I suppose you still hold the secret which Rosanna Moore\nentrusted you with--ah! you see I know her name, and why?--simply\nbecause, with the natural curiosity of the human race, I have been\ntrying to find out who murdered Oliver Whyte, and as the ARGUS very\ncleverly pointed out Rosanna Moore as likely to be at the bottom of the\nwhole affair, I have been learning her past history. The secret of\nWhyte's murder, and the reason for it, is known to you, but you refuse,\neven in the interests of justice, to reveal it--why, I don't know; but\nwe all have our little faults, and from an amiable though mistaken\nsense of--shall I say--duty?--you refuse to deliver up the man whose\ncowardly crime so nearly cost you your life. After your departure from\nMelbourne every one said, 'The hansom cab tragedy is at an end, and the\nmurderer will never be discovered.' I ventured to disagree with the\nwiseacres who made such a remark, and asked myself, 'Who was this woman\nwho died at Mother Guttersnipe's?' Receiving no satisfactory answer\nfrom myself, I determined to find out, and took steps accordingly. In\nthe first place, I learned from Roger Moreland, who, if you remember,\nwas a witness against you at the trial, that Whyte and Rosanna Moore\nhad come out to Sydney in the JOHN ELDER about a year ago as Mr. and\nMrs. Whyte. I need hardly say that they did not think it needful to go\nthrough the formality of marriage, as such a tie might have been found\ninconvenient on some future occasion. Moreland knew nothing about\nRosanna Moore, and advised me to give up the search, as, coming from a\ncity like London, it would be difficult to find anyone that knew her\nthere. Notwithstanding this, I telegraphed home to a friend of mine,\nwho is a bit of an amateur detective, 'Find out the name and all about\nthe woman who left England in the JOHN ELDER on the 21st day of August,\n18--, as wife of Oliver Whyte.' MIRABILE DICTU, he found out all about\nher, and knowing, as you do, what a maelstrom of humanity London is,\nyou must admit my friend was clever. It appears, however, that the task\nI set him was easier than he expected, for the so-called Mrs. Whyte was\nrather a notorious individual in her own way. She was a burlesque\nactress at the Frivolity Theatre in London, and, being a very handsome\nwoman, had been photographed innumerable times. Consequently, when she\nvery foolishly went with Whyte to choose a berth on board the boat, she\nwas recognised by the clerks in the office as Rosanna Moore, better\nknown as Musette of the Frivolity. Why she ran away with Whyte I cannot\ntell you. With reference to men understanding women, I refer you to\nBalzac's remark anent the same. Perhaps Musette got weary of St. John's\nWood and champagne suppers, and longed for the purer air of her native\nland. Ah! you open your eyes at this latter statement--you are\nsurprised--no, on second thoughts you are not, because she told you\nherself that she was a native of Sydney, and had gone home in 1858,\nafter a triumphant career of acting in Melbourne. And why did she leave\nthe applauding Melbourne public and the flesh-pots of Egypt? You know\nthis also. She ran away with a rich young squatter, with more money\nthan morals, who happened to be in Melbourne at the time. She seems to\nhave had a weakness for running away. But why she chose Whyte to go\nwith this time puzzles me. He was not rich, not particularly\ngood-looking, had no position, and a bad temper. How do I know all\nthese traits of Mr. Whyte's character, morally and socially? Easily\nenough; my omniscient friend found them all out. Mr. Oliver Whyte was\nthe son of a London tailor, and his father being well off, retired into\na private life, and ultimately went the way of all flesh. His son,\nfinding himself with a capital income, and a pretty taste for\namusement, cut the shop of his late lamented parent, found out that his\nfamily had come over with the Conqueror--Glanville de Whyte helped to\nsew the Bayeux tapestry, I suppose--and graduated at the Frivolity\nTheatre as a masher. In common with the other gilded youth of the day,\nhe worshipped at the gas-lit shrine of Musette, and the goddess,\npleased with his incense, left her other admirers in the lurch, and ran\noff with fortunate Mr. Whyte. So far as this goes there is nothing to\nshow why the murder was committed. Men do not perpetrate crimes for the\nsake of light o' loves like Musette, unless, indeed, some wretched\nyouth embezzles money to buy jewellery for his divinity. The career of\nMusette, in London, was simply that of a clever member of the\nDEMI-MONDE, and, as far as I can learn, no one was so much in love with\nher as to commit a crime for her sake. So far so good; the motive of\nthe crime must be found in Australia. Whyte had spent nearly all his\nmoney in England, and, consequently, Musette and her lover arrived in\nSydney with comparatively very little cash. However, with an\nEpicurean-like philosophy, they enjoyed themselves on what little they\nhad, and then came to Melbourne, where they stayed at a second-rate\nhotel. Musette, I may tell you, had one special vice, a common\none--drink. She loved champagne, and drank a good deal of it.\nConsequently, on arriving at Melbourne, and finding that a new\ngeneration had arisen, which knew not Joseph--I mean Musette--she\ndrowned her sorrows in the flowing bowl, and went out after a quarrel\nwith Mr. Whyte, to view Melbourne by night--a familiar scene to her, no\ndoubt. What took her to Little Bourke Street I don't know. Perhaps she\ngot lost--perhaps it had been a favourite walk of hers in the old days;\nat all events she was found dead drunk in that unsavoury locality, by\nSal Rawlins. I know this is so, because Sal told me so herself. Sal\nacted the part of the good Samaritan--took her to the squalid den she\ncalled home, and there Rosanna Moore fell dangerously ill. Whyte, who\nhad missed her, found out where she was, and that she was too ill to be\nremoved. I presume he was rather glad to get rid of such an\nencumbrance, so he went back to his lodgings at St. Kilda, which,\njudging from the landlady's story, he must have occupied for some time,\nwhile Rosanna Moore was drinking herself to death in a quiet hotel.\nStill he does not break off his connection with the dying woman; but\none night is murdered in a hansom cab, and that same night Rosanna\nMoore dies. So, from all appearance, everything is ended; not so, for\nbefore dying Rosanna sends for Brian Fitzgerald at his club, and\nreveals to him a secret which he locks up in his own heart. The writer\nof this letter has a theory--a fanciful one, if you will--that the\nsecret told to Brian Fitzgerald contains the mystery of Oliver Whyte's\ndeath. Now then, have I not found out a good deal without you, and do\nyou still decline to reveal the rest? I do not say you know who killed\nWhyte, but I do say you know sufficient to lead to the detection of the\nmurderer. If you tell me, so much the better, both for your own sense\nof justice and for your peace of mind; if you do not--well, I shall\nfind out without you. I have taken, and still take, a great interest in\nthis strange case, and I have sworn to bring the murderer to justice;\nso I make this last appeal to you to tell me what you know. If you\nrefuse, I will set to work to find out all about Rosanna Moore prior to\nher departure from Australia in 1858, and I am certain sooner or later\nto discover the secret which led to Whyte's murder. If there is any\nstrong reason why it should be kept silent, I perhaps, will come round\nto your view, and let the matter drop; but if I have to find it out\nmyself, the murderer of Oliver Whyte need expect no mercy at my hands.\nSo think over what I have said; if I do not hear from you within the\nnext week, I shall regard your decision as final, and pursue the search\nmyself. I am sure, my dear Fitzgerald, you will find this letter too\nlong, in spite of the interesting story it contains, so I will have\npity on you, and draw to a close. Remember me to Miss Frettlby and to\nher father. With kind regards to yourself, I remain, yours very truly,\n\n\"DUNCAN CALTON.\"\n\n\nWhen Fitzgerald had finished the last of the closely-written sheets, he\nlet the letter fall from his hands, and, leaning back in his chair,\nstared blankly into the dawning light outside. He arose after a few\nmoments, and, pouring himself out a glass of brandy, drank it quickly.\nThen mechanically lighting a cigar, he stepped out of the door into the\nfresh beauty of the dawn. There was a soft crimson glow in the east,\nwhich announced the approach of the sun, and he could hear the chirping\nof the awakening birds in the trees. But Brian did not see the\nmarvellous breaking of the dawn. He stood staring at the red light\nflaring in the east, and thinking of Calton's letter.\n\n\"I can do no more,\" he said bitterly, leaning his head against the wall\nof the house. \"There is only one way of stopping Calton, and that is by\ntelling him all. My poor Madge! My poor Madge!\"\n\nA soft wind arose, and rustled among the trees, and there appeared\ngreat shafts of crimson light in the east; then, with a sudden blaze,\nthe sun peered over the brim of the wide plain. The warm yellow rays\ntouched lightly the comely head of the weary man, and, turning round,\nhe held up his arms to the great luminary, as though he were a\nfire-worshipper.\n\n\"I accept the omen of the dawn,\" he cried, \"for her life and for mine.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nWHAT DR. CHINSTON SAID.\n\n\nHis resolution taken, Brian did not let the grass grow under his feet,\nbut rode over in the afternoon to tell Madge of his intended departure.\n\nThe servant told him she was in the garden, so he went there, and,\nguided by the sound of merry voices, and the laughter of pretty women,\nsoon found his way to the lawn-tennis ground. Madge and her guests\nwere there, seated under the shade of a great witch elm, and watching,\nwith great interest, a single-handed match being played between\nRolleston and Peterson, both of whom were capital players. Mr. Frettlby\nwas not present. He was inside writing letters, and talking with old\nMr. Valpy, and Brian gave a sigh of relief as he noted his absence.\nMadge caught sight of him as he came down the garden path, and flew\nquickly towards him with outstretched hands, as he took his hat off.\n\n\"How good of you to come,\" she said, in a delighted tone, as she took\nhis arm, \"and on such a hot day.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's something fearful in the shade,\" said pretty Mrs. Rolleston,\nwith a laugh, putting up her sunshade.\n\n\"Pardon me if I think the contrary,\" replied Fitzgerald, bowing, with\nan expressive look at the charming group of ladies under the great tree.\n\nMrs. Rolleston blushed and shook her head.\n\n\"Ah! it's easy seen you come from Ireland, Mr. Fitzgerald,\" she\nobserved, as she resumed her seat. \"You are making Madge jealous.\"\n\n\"So he is,\" answered Madge, with a gay laugh. \"I shall certainly inform\nMr. Rolleston about you, Brian, if you make these gallant remarks.\"\n\n\"Here he comes, then,\" said her lover, as Rolleston and Peterson,\nhaving finished their game, walked off the tennis ground, and joined\nthe group under the tree. Though in tennis flannels, they both looked\nremarkably warm, and, throwing aside his racket, Mr. Rolleston sat down\nwith a sigh of relief.\n\n\"Thank goodness it's over, and that I have won,\" he said, wiping his\nheated brow; \"galley slaves couldn't have worked harder than we have\ndone, while all you idle folks sat SUB TEGMINE FAGI.\"\n\n\"Which means?\" asked his wife, lazily.\n\n\"That onlookers see most of the game,\" answered her husband, impudently.\n\n\"I suppose that's what you call a free and easy translation,\" said\nPeterson, laughing. \"Mrs. Rolleston ought to give you something for\nyour new and original adaptation of Virgil.\"\n\n\"Let it be iced then,\" retorted Rolleston, lying full length on the\nground, and staring up at the blue of the sky as seen through the\nnetwork of leaves. \"I always like my 'something' iced.\"\n\n\"It's a way you've got,\" said Madge, with a laugh, as she gave him a\nglass filled with some sparkling, golden-coloured liquor, with a lump\nof ice clinking musically against the side of it.\n\n\"He's not the only one who's got that way,\" said Peterson, gaily, when\nhe had been similarly supplied.\n\n\n  \"It's a way we've got in the army,\n  It's a way we've got in the navy,\n  It's a way we've got in the 'Varsity.\"\n\n\n\"And so say all of us,\" finished Rolleston, and holding out his glass\nto be replenished; \"I'll have another, please. Whew, it is hot.\"\n\n\"What, the drink?\" asked Julia, with a giggle.\n\n\"No--the day,\" answered Felix, making a face at her. \"It's the kind of\nday one feels inclined to adopt Sydney Smith's advice, by getting out\nof one's skin, and letting the wind whistle through one's bones.\"\n\n\"With such a hot wind blowing,\" said Peterson, gravely, \"I'm afraid\nthey'd soon be broiled bones.\"\n\n\"Go, giddy one,\" retorted Felix, throwing his hat at him, \"or I'll drag\nyou into the blazing sun, and make you play another game.\"\n\n\"Not I,\" replied Peterson, coolly. \"Not being a salamander, I'm hardly\nused to your climate yet, and there is a limit even to lawn tennis;\"\nand turning his back on Rolleston, he began to talk to Julia\nFeatherweight.\n\nMeanwhile, Madge and her lover, leaving all this frivolous chatter\nbehind them, were walking slowly towards the house, and Brian was\ntelling her of his approaching departure, though not of his reasons for\nit.\n\n\"I received a letter last night,\" he said, turning his face away from\nher; \"and, as it's about some important business, I must start at once.\"\n\n\"I don't think it will be long before we follow,\" answered Madge,\nthoughtfully. \"Papa leaves here at the end of the week.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know,\" said Madge, petulantly; \"he is so restless,\nand never seems to settle down to anything. He says for the rest of his\nlife he is going to do nothing; but wander all over the world.\"\n\nThere suddenly flashed across Fitzgerald's mind a line from Genesis,\nwhich seemed singularly applicable to Mr. Frettlby--\"A fugitive and a\nvagabond thou shalt be in the earth.\"\n\n\"Everyone gets these restless fits sooner or later,\" he said, idly. \"In\nfact,\" with an uneasy laugh, \"I believe I'm in one myself.\"\n\n\"That puts me in mind of what I heard Dr. Chinston say yesterday,\" she\nsaid. \"This is the age of unrest, as electricity and steam have turned\nus all into Bohemians.\"\n\n\"Ah! Bohemia is a pleasant place,\" said Brian, absently, unconsciously\nquoting Thackeray, \"but we all lose our way to it late in life.\"\n\n\"At that rate we won't lose our way to it for some time,\" she said\nlaughing, as they stepped into the drawing-room, so cool and shady,\nafter the heat and glare outside.\n\nAs they entered Mr. Frettlby rose from a chair near the window. He\nappeared to have been reading, for he held a book in his hand.\n\n\"What! Fitzgerald,\" he exclaimed, in a hearty tone, as he held out his\nhand; \"I am glad to see you.\"\n\n\"I let you know I am living, don't I?\" replied Brian, his face flushing\nas he reluctantly took the proffered hand. \"But the fact is I have come\nto say good-bye for a few days.\"\n\n\"Ah! going back to town, I suppose,\" said Mr. Frettlby, lying back in\nhis chair, and playing with his watch chain. \"I don't know that you are\nwise, exchanging the clear air of the country for the dusty atmosphere\nof Melbourne.\"\n\n\"Yet Madge tells me you are going back,\" said Brian, idly toying with a\nvase of flowers on the table.\n\n\"Depends upon circumstances,\" replied the other carelessly. \"I may and\nI may not. You go on business, I presume?\"\n\n\"Well, the fact is Calton--\" Here Brian stopped suddenly, and bit his\nlip with vexation, for he had not intended to mention the lawyer's name.\n\n\"Yes?\" said Mr. Frettlby, interrogatively, sitting up quickly, and\nlooking keenly at Brian.\n\n\"Wants to see me on business,\" he finished, awkwardly.\n\n\"Connected with the sale of your station, I suppose,\" said Frettlby,\nstill keeping his eyes on the young man's face.\n\n\"Can't have a better man. Calton's an excellent man of business.\"\n\n\"A little too excellent,\" replied Fitzgerald, ruefully, \"he's a man who\ncan't leave well alone.\"\n\n\"A PROPOS of what?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing,\" answered Fitzgerald, hastily, and just then his eyes met\nthose of Frettlby. The two men looked at one another steadily for a\nmoment, but in that short space of time a single name flashed through\ntheir brains--the name of Rosanna Moore. Mr. Frettlby was the first to\nlower his eyes, and break the spell.\n\n\"Ah, well,\" he said, lightly, as he rose from his chair and held out\nhis hand, \"if you are two weeks in town, call at St. Kilda, and it's\nmore than likely you will find us there.\"\n\nBrian shook hands in silence, and watched him pick up his hat, and move\non to the verandah, and then out into the hot sunshine.\n\n\"He knows,\" he muttered involuntarily.\n\n\"Knows what, sir?\" said Madge, who came silently behind him, and\nslipped her arm through his. \"That you are hungry, and want something\nto eat before you leave us?\"\n\n\"I don't feel hungry,\" said Brian, as they walked towards the door.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" answered Madge, merrily, who, like Eve, was on hospitable\nthoughts intent. \"I'm not going to have you appear in Melbourne a pale,\nfond lover, as though I were treating you badly. Come, sir--no,\" she\ncontinued, putting up her hand as he tried to kiss her, \"business\nfirst, pleasure afterwards,\" and they went into the dining-room\nlaughing.\n\nMark Frettlby wandered down to the lawn-tennis ground, thinking of the\nlook he had seen in Brian's eyes. He shivered for a moment in the hot\nsunshine, as though it had grown suddenly chill.\n\n\"Someone stepping across my grave,\" he murmured to himself, with a\ncynical smile. \"Bah! how superstitious I am, and yet--he knows, he\nknows!\"\n\n\"Come on, sir,\" cried Felix, who had just caught sight of him, \"a\nracket awaits you.\"\n\nFrettlby awoke with a start, and found himself near the lawn-tennis\nground, and Felix at his elbow, smoking a cigarette.\n\nHe roused himself with a great effort, and tapped the young man lightly\non the shoulder.\n\n\"What?\" he said with a forced laugh, \"do you really expect me to play\nlawn tennis on such a day? You are mad.\"\n\n\"I am hot, you mean,\" retorted the imperturbable Rolleston, blowing a\nwreath of smoke.\n\n\"That's a foregone conclusion,\" said Dr. Chinston, who came up at that\nmoment.\n\n\"Such a charming novel,\" cried Julia, who had just caught the last\nremark.\n\n\"What is?\" asked Peterson, rather puzzled.\n\n\"Howell's book, 'A Foregone Conclusion,'\" said Julia, also looking\npuzzled. \"Weren't you talking about it?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid this talk is getting slightly incoherent,\" said Felix, with\na sigh. \"We all seem madder than usual to-day.\"\n\n\"Speak for yourself,\" said Chinston, indignantly, \"I'm as sane as any\nman in the world.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" retorted the other coolly, \"that's what I say, and you,\nbeing a doctor, ought to know that every man and woman in the world is\nmore or less mad.\"\n\n\"Where are your facts?\" asked Chinston, smiling.\n\n\"My facts are all visible ones,\" said Felix, gravely pointing to the\ncompany. \"They're all crooked on some point or another.\"\n\nThere was a chorus of indignant denial at this, and then every one\nburst out laughing at the extraordinary way in which Mr. Rolleston was\narguing.\n\n\"If you go on like that in the House,\" said Frettlby, amused, \"you\nwill, at all events, have an entertaining Parliament.\"\n\n\"Ah! they'll never have an entertaining Parliament till they admit\nladies,\" observed Peterson, with a quizzical glance at Julia.\n\n\"It will be a Parliament of love then,\" retorted the doctor, dryly,\n\"and not mediaeval either.\"\n\nFrettlby took the doctor's arm, and walked away with him. \"I want you\nto come up to my study, doctor,\" he said, as they strolled towards the\nhouse, \"and examine me.\"\n\n\"Why, don't you feel well?\" said Chinston, as they entered the house.\n\n\"Not lately,\" replied Frettlby. \"I'm afraid I've got heart disease.\"\n\nThe doctor looked sharply at him, and then shook his head.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" he said, cheerfully, \"it's a common delusion with people\nthat they have heart disease, and in nine cases, out of ten it's all\nimagination; unless, indeed,\" he added waggishly, \"the patient happens\nto be a young man.\"\n\n\"Ah! I suppose you think I'm safe as far as that goes,\" said Frettlby,\nas they entered the study; \"and what did you think of Rolleston's\nargument about people being mad?\"\n\n\"It was amusing,\" replied Chinston, taking a seat, Frettlby doing the\nsame. \"That's all I can say about it, though, mind you, I think there\nare more mad people at large than the world is aware of.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"Yes; do you remember that horrible story of Dickens', in the 'Pickwick\nPapers,' about the man who was mad, and knew it, yet successfully\nconcealed it for years? Well, I believe there are many people like that\nin the world, people whose lives are one long struggle against\ninsanity, and yet who eat, drink, talk, and walk with the rest of their\nfellow-men, apparently as gay and light-hearted as they are.\"\n\n\"How extraordinary.\"\n\n\"Half the murders and suicides are done in temporary fits of insanity,\"\nwent on Chinston, \"and if a person broods over anything, his incipient\nmadness is sure to break out sooner or later; but, of course, there are\ncases where a perfectly sane person may commit a murder on the impulse\nof the moment, but I regard such persons as mad for the time being;\nbut, again, a murder may be planned and executed in the most\ncold-blooded manner.\"\n\n\"And in the latter case,\" said Frettlby, without looking at the doctor,\nand playing with a paper knife, \"do you regard the murderer as mad?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" answered the doctor, bluntly. \"He is as mad as a person\nwho kills another because he supposes he has been told by God to do\nso--only there is method in his madness. For instance, I believe that\nhansom cab murder, in which you were mixed up--\"\n\n\"I wasn't mixed up in it,\" interrupted Frettlby, pale with anger.\n\n\"Beg pardon,\" said Chinston, coolly, \"a slip of the tongue; I was\nthinking of Fitzgerald. Well, I believe that crime to have been\npremeditated, and that the man who committed it was mad. He is, no\ndoubt, at large now, walking about and conducting himself as sanely as\nyou or I, yet the germ of insanity is there, and sooner or later he\nwill commit another crime.\"\n\n\"How do you know it was premeditated?\" asked Frettlby, abruptly.\n\n\"Any one can see that,\" answered the other. \"Whyte was watched on that\nnight, and when Fitzgerald went away the other was ready to take his\nplace, dressed the same.\"\n\n\"That's nothing,\" retorted Frettlby, looking at his companion sharply.\n\"There are dozens of men in Melbourne who wear evening dress, light\ncoats, and soft hats--in fact, I generally wear them myself.\"\n\n\"Well, that might have been a coincidence,\" said the doctor, rather\ndisconcerted; \"but the use of chloroform puts the question beyond a\ndoubt; people don't usually carry chloroform about with them.\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" answered the other, and then the matter dropped.\nChinston made an examination of Mark Frettlby, and when he had\nfinished, his face was very grave, though he laughed at the\nmillionaire's fears.\n\n\"You are all right,\" he said, gaily. \"Action of the heart a little\nweak, that's all--only,\" impressively, \"avoid excitement--avoid\nexcitement.\"\n\nJust as Frettlby was putting on his coat, a knock came to the door, and\nMadge entered.\n\n\"Brian is gone,\" she began. \"Oh, I beg your pardon, doctor--but is papa\nill?\" she asked with sudden fear.\n\n\"No, child, no,\" said Frettlby, hastily, \"I'm all right; I thought my\nheart was affected, but it isn't.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" answered Chinston, reassuringly. \"All right--only\navoid excitement.\"\n\nBut when Frettlby turned to go to the door, Madge, who had her eyes\nfixed on the doctor's face, saw how grave it was.\n\n\"There is danger?\" she said, touching his arm as they paused for a\nmoment at the door.\n\n\"No! No!\" he answered, hastily.\n\n\"Yes, there is,\" she persisted. \"Tell me the worst, it is best for me\nto know.\"\n\nThe doctor looked at her in some doubt for a few moments, and then\nplaced his hand on her shoulder.\n\n\"My dear young lady,\" he said gravely, \"I will tell you what I have not\ndared to tell your father.\"\n\n\"What?\" she asked in a low voice, her face growing pale.\n\n\"His heart is affected.\"\n\n\"And there is great danger?\"\n\n\"Yes, great danger. In the event of any sudden shock--\" he hesitated.\n\n\"Yes--\"\n\n\"He would probably drop down dead.\"\n\n\"My God!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nKILSIP HAS A THEORY OF HIS OWN.\n\n\nMr. Calton sat in his office reading a letter he had just received from\nFitzgerald, and judging from the complacent smile upon his face it\nseemed to give him the greatest satisfaction.\n\n\"I know,\" wrote Brian, \"that now you have taken up the affair, you will\nnot stop until you find out everything, so, as I want the matter to\nrest as at present, I will anticipate you, and reveal all. You were\nright in your conjecture that I knew something likely to lead to the\ndetection of Whyte's murderer; but when I tell you my reasons for\nkeeping such a thing secret, I am sure you will not blame me. Mind you,\nI do not say that I know who committed the murder; but I have\nsuspicions--very strong suspicions--and I wish to God Rosanna Moore had\ndied before she told me what she did. However, I will tell you all, and\nleave you to judge as to whether I was justified in concealing what I\nwas told. I will call at your office some time next week, and then you\nwill learn everything that Rosanna Moore told me; but once that you are\npossessed of the knowledge you will pity me.\"\n\n\"Most extraordinary,\" mused Calton, leaning back in his chair, as he\nlaid down the letter. \"I wonder if he's about to tell me that he killed\nWhyte after all, and that Sal Rawlins perjured herself to save him! No,\nthat's nonsense, or she'd have turned up in better time, and wouldn't\nhave risked his neck up to the last moment. Though I make it a rule\nnever to be surprised at anything, I expect what Brian Fitzgerald has\nto tell me will startle me considerably. I've never met with such an\nextraordinary case, and from all appearances the end isn't reached yet.\nAfter all,\" said Mr. Calton, thoughtfully, \"truth is stranger than\nfiction.\"\n\nHere a knock came to the door, and in answer to an invitation to enter,\nit opened, and Kilsip glided into the room.\n\n\"You're not engaged, sir?\" he said, in his soft, low voice.\n\n\"Oh, dear, no,\" answered Calton, carelessly; \"come in--come in!\"\n\nKilsip closed the door softly, and gliding along in his usual\nvelvet-footed manner, sat down in a chair near Calton's, and placing\nhis hat on the ground, looked keenly at the barrister.\n\n\"Well, Kilsip,\" said Calton, with a yawn, playing with his watch\nchain, \"any good news to tell me?\"\n\n\"Well, nothing particularly new,\" purred the detective, rubbing his\nhands together.\n\n\"Nothing new, and nothing true, and no matter,\" said Calton, quoting\nEmerson. \"And what have you come to see me about?\"\n\n\"The Hansom Cab Murder,\" replied the other quietly.\n\n\"The deuce!\" cried Calton, startled out of his professional dignity.\n\"And have you found out who did it?\"\n\n\"No!\" answered Kilsip, rather dismally; \"but I have an idea.\"\n\n\"So had Gorby,\" retorted Calton, dryly, \"an idea that ended in smoke.\nHave you any practical proofs?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"That means you are going to get some?\"\n\n\"If possible.\"\n\n\"Much virtue in 'if,'\" quoted Calton, picking up a pencil, and\nscribbling idly on his blotting paper. \"And to whom does your suspicion\npoint?\"\n\n\"Aha!\" said Mr. Kilsip, cautiously.\n\n\"Don't know him,\" answered the other, coolly; \"family name Humbug, I\npresume. Bosh! Whom do you suspect?\"\n\nKilsip looked round cautiously, as if to make sure they were alone, and\nthen said, in a stage whisper--\n\n\"Roger Moreland!\"\n\n\"That was the young man that gave evidence as to how Whyte got drunk?\"\n\nKilsip nodded.\n\n\"Well, and how do you connect him with the murder?\"\n\n\"Do you remember in the evidence given by the cabmen, Royston and\nRankin, they both swore that the man who was with Whyte on that night\nwore a diamond ring on the forefinger of the right hand?\"\n\n\"What of that? Nearly every second man in Melbourne wears a diamond\nring?\"\n\n\"But not on the forefinger of the right hand.\"\n\n\"Oh! And Moreland wears a ring in that way?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"Merely a coincidence. Is that all your proof?\"\n\n\"All I can obtain at present.\"\n\n\"It's very weak,\" said Calton, scornfully.\n\n\"The weakest proofs may form a chain to hang a man,\" observed Kilsip,\nsententiously.\n\n\"Moreland gave his evidence clearly enough,\" said Calton, rising, and\npacing the room. \"He met Whyte; they got drunk together. Whyte went out\nof the hotel, and shortly afterwards Moreland followed with the coat,\nwhich was left behind by Whyte, and then someone snatched it from him.\"\n\n\"Ah, did they?\" interrupted Kilsip, quickly.\n\n\"So Moreland says,\" said Calton, stopping short. \"I understand; you\nthink Moreland was not so drunk as he would make out, and that after\nfollowing Whyte outside, he put on his coat, and got into the cab with\nhim.\"\n\n\"That is my theory.\"\n\n\"It's ingenious enough,\" said the barrister; \"but why should Moreland\nmurder Whyte? What motive had he?\"\n\n\"Those papers--\"\n\n\"Pshaw! another idea of Gorby's,\" said Calton, angrily. \"How do you\nknow there were any papers?\"\n\nThe fact is, Calton did not intend Kilsip to know that Whyte really had\npapers until he heard what Fitzgerald had to tell him.\n\n\"And another thing,\" said Calton, resuming his walk, \"if your theory is\ncorrect, which I don't think it is, what became of Whyte's coat? Has\nMoreland got it?\"\n\n\"No, he has not,\" answered the detective, decisively.\n\n\"You seem very positive about it,\" said the lawyer, after a moment's\npause. \"Did you ask Moreland about it?\"\n\nA reproachful look came into Kilsip's white face.\n\n\"Not quite so green,\" he said, forcing a smile. \"I thought you'd a\nbetter opinion of me than that, Mr. Calton. Ask him?--no.\"\n\n\"Then how did you find out?\"\n\n\"The fact is, Moreland is employed as a barman in the Kangaroo Hotel.\"\n\n\"A barman!\" echoed Calton; \"and he came out here as a gentleman of\nindependent fortune. Why, hang it, man, that in itself is sufficient to\nprove that he had no motive to murder Whyte. Moreland pretty well lived\non Whyte, so what could have induced him to kill his golden goose, and\nbecome a barman--pshaw! the idea is absurd.\"\n\n\"Well, you may be right about the matter,\" said Kilsip, rather angrily;\n\"and if Gorby makes mistakes I don't pretend to be infallible. But, at\nall events, when I saw Moreland in the bar he wore a silver ring on the\nforefinger of his right hand.\"\n\n\"Silver isn't a diamond.\"\n\n\"No; but it shows that was the finger he was accustomed to wear his\nring on. When I saw that, I determined to search his room. I managed to\ndo so while he was out, and found--\"\n\n\"A mare's nest?\"\n\nKilsip nodded.\n\n\"And so your castle of cards falls to the ground,\" said Calton,\njestingly. \"Your idea is absurd. Moreland no more committed the murder\nthan I did. Why, he was too drunk on that night to do anything.\"\n\n\"Humph--so he says.\"\n\n\"Well, men don't calumniate themselves for nothing.\"\n\n\"It was a lesser danger to avert a greater one,\" replied Kilsip,\ncoolly. \"I am sure that Moreland was not drunk on that night. He only\nsaid so to escape awkward questions as to his movements. Depend upon it\nhe knows more than he lets out.\"\n\n\"Well, and how do you intend to set about the matter?\"\n\n\"I shall start looking for the coat first.\"\n\n\"Ah! you think he has hidden it?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it. My theory is this. When Moreland got out of the cab\nat Powlett Street--\"\n\n\"But he didn't,\" interrupted Calton, angrily.\n\n\"Let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that he did,\" said Kilsip,\nquietly. \"I say when he left the cab he walked up Powlett Street,\nturned to the left down George Street, and walked back to town through\nthe Fitzroy Gardens, then, knowing that the coat was noticeable, he\nthrew it away, or rather, hid it, and walked out of the Gardens through\nthe town--\"\n\n\"In evening dress--more noticeable than the coat.\"\n\n\"He wasn't in evening dress,\" said Kilsip, quietly.\n\n\"No, neither was he,\" observed Calton, eagerly, recalling the evidence\nat the trial. \"Another blow to your theory. The murderer was in evening\ndress--the cabman said so.\"\n\n\"Yes; because he had seen Mr. Fitzgerald in evening dress a few minutes\nbefore, and thought that he was the same man who got into the cab with\nWhyte.\"\n\n\"Well, what of that?\"\n\n\"If you remember, the second man had his coat buttoned up. Moreland\nwore dark trousers--at least, I suppose so--and, with the coat buttoned\nup, it was easy for the cabman to make the mistake, believing, as he\ndid, that it was Mr. Fitzgerald.\"\n\n\"That sounds better,\" said Calton, thoughtfully. \"And what are you\ngoing to do?\"\n\n\"Look for the coat in the Fitzroy Gardens.\"\n\n\"Pshaw! a wild goose chase.\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" said Kilsip, as he arose to go.\n\n\"And when shall I see you again?\" said Calton.\n\n\"Oh, to-night,\" said Kilsip, pausing at, the door. \"I had nearly\nforgotten, Mother Guttersnipe wants to see you.\"\n\n\"Why? What's up?\"\n\n\"She's dying, and wants to tell you some secret.\"\n\n\"Rosanna Moore, by Jove!\" said Calton. \"She'll tell me something about\nher. I'll get to the bottom of this yet. All right, I'll be here at\neight o'clock.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir!\" and the detective glided out.\n\n\"I wonder if that old woman knows anything?\" said Calton to himself, as\nhe resumed his seat. \"She may have overheard some conversation between\nWhyte and his mistress, and intends to divulge it. Well, I'm afraid\nwhen Fitzgerald does confess, I shall know all about it beforehand.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nMOTHER GUTTERSNIPE JOINS THE MAJORITY.\n\n\nPunctual to his appointment, Kilsip called at Calton's office at eight\no'clock, in order to guide him through the squalid labyrinths of the\nslums. He found the barrister waiting impatiently for him. The fact is,\nCalton had got it into his head that Rosanna Moore was at the bottom of\nthe whole mystery, and every new piece of evidence he discovered went\nto confirm this belief. When Rosanna Moore was dying, she might have\nconfessed something to Mother Guttersnipe, which would hint at the name\nof the murderer, and he had a strong suspicion that the old hag had\nreceived hush-money in order to keep quiet. Several times before Calton\nhad been on the point of going to her and trying to get the secret out\nof her--that is, if she knew it; but now fate appeared to be playing\ninto his hands, and a voluntary confession was much more likely to be\ntrue than one dragged piecemeal from unwilling lips.\n\nBy the time Kilsip made his appearance Calton was in a high state of\nexcitement.\n\n\"I suppose we'd better go at once,\" he said to Kilsip, as he lit a\ncigar. \"That old hag may go off at any moment.\"\n\n\"She might,\" assented Kilsip, doubtfully; \"but I wouldn't be a bit\nsurprised if she pulled through. Some of these old women have nine\nlives like a cat.\"\n\n\"Not improbable,\" retorted Calton, as they passed into the\nbrilliantly-lighted street; \"her nature seemed to me to be essentially\nfeline. But tell me,\" he went on, \"what's the matter with her--old age?\"\n\n\"Partly; drink also, I think,\" answered Kilsip. \"Besides, her\nsurroundings are not very healthy, and her dissipated habits have\npretty well settled her.\"\n\n\"It isn't anything catching, I hope,\" cried the barrister, with a\nshudder, as they passed into the crowd of Bourke Street.\n\n\"Don't know, sir, not being a doctor,\" answered the detective, stolidly.\n\n\"Oh!\" ejaculated Calton, in dismay.\n\n\"It will be all right, sir,\" said Kilsip, reassuringly; \"I've been\nthere dozens of times, and I'm all right.\"\n\n\"I dare say,\" retorted the barrister; \"but I may go there once and\ncatch it, whatever it is.\"\n\n\"Take my word, sir, it's nothing worse than old age and drink.\"\n\n\"Has she a doctor?\"\n\n\"Won't let one come near her--prescribes for herself.\"\n\n\"Gin, I suppose? Humph! Much more unpleasant than the usual run of\nmedicines.\"\n\nIn a short time they found themselves in Little Bourke Street, and\nafter traversing a few dark and narrow lanes--by this time they were\nmore or less familiar to Calton--they found themselves before Mother\nGuttersnipe's den.\n\nThey climbed the rickety stairs, which groaned and creaked beneath\ntheir weight, and found Mother Guttersnipe lying on the bed in the\ncorner. The elfish black-haired child was playing cards with a\nslatternly-looking girl at a deal table by the faint light of a tallow\ncandle.\n\nThey both sprang to their feet as the strangers entered, and the elfish\nchild pushed a broken chair in a sullen manner towards Mr. Calton,\nwhile the other girl shuffled into a far corner of the room, and\ncrouched down there like a dog. The noise of their entry awoke the hag\nfrom an uneasy slumber into which she had fallen. Sitting up in bed,\nshe huddled the clothes round her. She presented such a gruesome\nspectacle that involuntarily Calton recoiled. Her white hair was\nunbound, and hung in tangled masses over her shoulders in snowy\nprofusion. Her face, parched and wrinkled, with the hooked nose, and\nbeady black eyes, like those of a mouse, was poked forward, and her\nskinny arms, bare to the shoulder, were waving wildly about as she\ngrasped at the bedclothes with her claw-like hands. The square bottle\nand the broken cup lay beside her, and filling herself a dram, she\nlapped it up greedily.\n\nThe irritant brought on a paroxysm of coughing which lasted until the\nelfish child shook her well, and took the cup from her.\n\n\"Greedy old beast,\" muttered this amiable infant, peering into the cup,\n\"ye'd drink the Yarrer dry, I b'lieve.\"\n\n\"Yah!\" muttered the old woman feebly. \"Who's they, Lizer?\" she said,\nshading her eyes with one trembling hand, while she looked at Calton\nand the detective.\n\n\"The perlice cove an' the swell,\" said Lizer, suddenly. \"Come to see\nyer turn up your toes.\"\n\n\"I ain't dead yet, ye whelp,\" snarled the hag with sudden energy; \"an'\nif I gits up I'll turn up yer toes, cuss ye.\"\n\nLizer gave a shrill laugh of disdain, and Kilsip stepped forward.\n\n\"None of this,\" he said, sharply, taking Lizer by one thin shoulder,\nand pushing her over to where the other girl was crouching; \"stop there\ntill I tell you to move.\"\n\nLizer tossed back her tangled black hair, and was about to make some\nimpudent reply, when the other girl, who was older and wiser, put out\nher hand, and pulled her down beside her.\n\nMeanwhile, Calton was addressing himself to the old woman in the corner.\n\n\"You wanted to see me?\" he said gently, for, notwithstanding his\nrepugnance to her, she was, after all, a woman, and dying.\n\n\"Yes, cuss ye,\" croaked Mother Guttersnipe, lying down, and pulling the\ngreasy bedclothes up to her neck. \"You ain't a parson?\" with sudden\nsuspicion.\n\n\"No, I am a lawyer.\"\n\n\"I ain't a-goin' to have the cussed parsons a-prowlin' round 'ere,\"\ngrowled the old woman, viciously. \"I ain't a-goin' to die yet, cuss ye;\nI'm goin' to get well an' strong, an' 'ave a good time of it.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you won't recover,\" said Calton, gently. \"You had better\nlet me send for a doctor.\"\n\n\"No, I shan't,\" retorted the hag, aiming a blow at him with all her\nfeeble strength. \"I ain't a-goin' to have my inside spil'd with salts\nand senner. I don't want neither parsons nor doctors, I don't. I\nwouldn't 'ave a lawyer, only I'm a-thinkin' of makin' my will, I am.\"\n\n\"Mind I gits the watch,\" yelled Lizer, from the corner. \"If you gives\nit to Sal I'll tear her eyes out.\"\n\n\"Silence!\" said Kilsip, sharply, and, with a muttered curse, Lizer sat\nback in her corner.\n\n\"Sharper than a serpent's tooth, she are,\" whined the old woman, when\nquiet was once more restored. \"That young devil 'ave fed at my 'ome,\nan' now she turns, cuss her.\"\n\n\"Well--well,\" said Calton, rather impatiently, \"what is it you wanted\nto see me about?\"\n\n\"Don't be in such a 'urry,\" said the hag, with a scowl, \"or I'm blamed\nif I tell you anything, s'elp me.\"\n\nShe was evidently growing very weak, so Calton turned to Kilsip and\ntold him in a whisper to get a doctor. The detective scribbled a note\non some paper, and, giving it to Lizer, ordered her to take it. At\nthis, the other girl arose, and, putting her arm in that of the\nchild's, they left together.\n\n\"Them two young 'usseys gone?\" said Mother Guttersnipe. \"Right you are,\nfor I don't want what I've got to tell to git into the noospaper, I\ndon't.\"\n\n\"And what is it?\" asked Calton, bending forward.\n\nThe old woman took another drink of gin, and it seemed to put life into\nher, for she sat up in the bed, and commenced to talk rapidly, as\nthough she were afraid of dying before her secret was told.\n\n\"You've been 'ere afore?\" she said, pointing one skinny finger at\nCalton, \"and you wanted to find out all about 'er; but you didn't. She\nwouldn't let me tell, for she was always a proud jade, a-flouncin'\nround while 'er pore mother was a-starvin'.\"\n\n\"Her mother! Are you Rosanna Moore's mother?\" cried Calton,\nconsiderably astonished.\n\n\"May I die if I ain't,\" croaked the hag. \"'Er pore father died of\ndrink, cuss 'im, an' I'm a-follerin' 'im to the same place in the same\nway. You weren't about town in the old days, or you'd a-bin after her,\ncuss ye.\"\n\n\"After Rosanna?\"\n\n\"The werry girl,\" answered Mother Guttersnipe. \"She were on the stage,\nshe were, an' my eye, what a swell she were, with all the coves a-dyin'\nfor 'er, an' she dancin' over their black 'earts, cuss 'em; but she was\nallays good to me till 'e came.\"\n\n\"Who came?\"\n\n\"'E!\" yelled the old woman, raising herself on her arm, her eyes\nsparkling with vindictive fury. \"'E, a-comin' round with di'monds and\ngold, and a-ruinin' my pore girl; an' how 'e's 'eld 'is bloomin' 'ead\nup all these years as if he were a saint, cuss 'im--cuss 'im.\"\n\n\"Whom does she mean?\" whispered Calton to Kilsip.\n\n\"Mean!\" screamed Mother Guttersnipe, whose sharp ears had caught the\nmuttered question. \"Why, Mark Frettlby!\"\n\n\"Good God!\" Calton rose up in his astonishment, and even Kilsip's\ninscrutable countenance displayed some surprise.\n\n\"Aye, 'e were a swell in them days,\" pursued Mother Guttersnipe, \"and\n'e comes a-philanderin' round my gal, cuss 'im, an' ruins 'er, and\nleaves 'er an' the child to starve, like a black-'earted villain as 'e\nwere.\"\n\n\"The child! Her name?\"\n\n\"Bah,\" retorted the hag, with scorn, \"as if you didn't know my\ngran'daughter Sal.\"\n\n\"Sal, Mark Frettlby's child?\"\n\n\"Yes, an' as pretty a girl as the other, tho' she 'appened to be born\non the wrong side of the 'edge. Oh, I've seen 'er a-sweepin' along in\n'er silks an' satins as tho' we were dirt--an' Sal 'er 'alf\nsister--cuss 'er.\"\n\nExhausted by the efforts she had made, the old woman sank back in her\nbed, while Calton sat dazed, thinking over the astounding revelation\nthat had just been made. That Rosanna Moore should turn out to be Mark\nFrettlby's mistress he hardly wondered at; after all, the millionaire\nwas but a man, and in his young days had been no better and no worse\nthan the rest of his friends. Rosanna Moore was pretty, and was\nevidently one of those women who--rakes at heart--prefer the\nuntrammelled freedom of being a mistress, to the sedate bondage of a\nwife. In questions of morality, so many people live in glass houses,\nthat there are few nowadays who can afford to throw stones. Calton did\nnot think any the worse of Frettlby for his youthful follies. But what\ndid surprise him was that Frettlby should be so heartless, as to leave\nhis child to the tender mercies of an old hag like Mother Guttersnipe.\nIt was so entirely different from what he knew of the man, that he was\ninclined to think that the old woman was playing him a trick.\n\n\"Did Mr. Frettlby know Sal was his child?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not 'e,\" snarled Mother Guttersnipe, in an exultant tone. \"'E thought\nshe was dead, 'e did, arter Rosanner gave him the go-by.\"\n\n\"And why did you not tell him?\"\n\n\"'Cause I wanted to break 'is 'eart, if 'e 'ad any,\" said the old\nbeldame, vindictively. \"Sal was a-goin' wrong as fast as she could till\nshe was tuk from me. If she had gone and got into quod I'd 'ave gone to\n'im, and said, 'Look at yer darter! 'Ow I've ruined her as you did\nmine.'\"\n\n\"You wicked woman,\" said Calton, revolted at the malignity of the\nscheme. \"You sacrificed an innocent girl for this.\"\n\n\"None of yer preachin',\" retorted the hag sullenly; \"I ain't bin\nbrought up for a saint, I ain't--an' I wanted to pay 'im out--'e paid\nme well to 'old my tongue about my darter, an' I've got it 'ere,\"\nlaying her hand on the pillow, \"all gold, good gold--an' mine, cuss me.\"\n\nCalton rose, he felt quite sick at this exhibition of human depravity,\nand longed to be away. As he was putting on his hat, however, the two\ngirls entered with the doctor, who nodded to Kilsip, cast a sharp\nscrutinising glance at Calton, and then walked over to the bed. The two\ngirls went back to their corner, and waited in silence for the end.\nMother Guttersnipe had fallen back in the bed, with one claw-like hand\nclutching the pillow, as if to protect her beloved gold, and over her\nface a deadly paleness was spreading, which told the practised eye of\nthe doctor that the end was near. He knelt down beside the bed for a\nmoment, holding the candle to the dying woman's face. She opened her\neyes, and muttered drowsily--\n\n\"Who's you? get out,\" but then she seemed to grasp the situation again,\nand she started up with a shrill yell, which made the hearers shudder,\nit was so weird and eerie.\n\n\"My money!\" she yelled, clasping the pillow in her skinny arms. \"It's\nall mine, ye shan't have it--cuss ye.\"\n\nThe doctor arose from his knees, and shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Not worth while doing anything,\" he said coolly, \"she'll be dead soon.\"\n\nThe old woman, mumbling over her pillow, caught the word, and burst\ninto tears.\n\n\"Dead! dead! my poor Rosanna, with 'er golden 'air, always lovin' 'er\npore mother till 'e took 'er away, an' she came back to die--die--ooh!\"\n\nHer voice died away in a long melancholy wail, that made the two girls\nin the corner shiver, and put their fingers in their ears.\n\n\"My good woman,\" said the doctor, bending over the bed, \"would you not\nlike to see a minister?\"\n\nShe looked at him with her bright, beady eyes, already somewhat dimmed\nwith the mists of death, and said, in a harsh, low whisper--\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because you have only a short time to live,\" said the doctor, gently.\n\"You are dying.\"\n\nMother Guttersnipe sprang up, and seized his arm with a scream of\nterror.\n\n\"Dyin', dyin'--no! no!\" she wailed, clawing his sleeve. \"I ain't fit to\ndie--cuss me; save me--save me; I don't know where I'd go to, s'elp\nme--save me.\"\n\nThe doctor tried to remove her hands, but she held on with wonderful\ntenacity.\n\n\"It is impossible,\" he said briefly.\n\nThe hag fell back in her bed.\n\n\"I'll give you money to save me,\" she shrieked; \"good money--all\nmine--all mine. See--see--'ere--suverains,\" and tearing her pillow\nopen, she took out a canvas bag, and from it poured a gleaming stream\nof gold. Gold--gold--it rolled all over the bed, over the floor, away\ninto the dark corners, yet no one touched it, so enchained were they by\nthe horrible spectacle of the dying woman clinging to life. She\nclutched some of the shining pieces, and held them up to the three men\nas they stood silently beside the bed, but her hands trembled so that\nsovereigns kept falling from them on the floor with metallic clinks.\n\n\"All mine--all mine,\" she shrieked, loudly. \"Give me my\nlife--gold--money--cuss ye--I sold my soul for it--save me--give me my\nlife,\" and, with trembling hands, she tried to force the gold on them.\nThey said no word, but stood silently looking at her, while the two\ngirls in the corner clung together, and trembled with fear.\n\n\"Don't look at me--don't,\" cried the hag, falling down again amid the\nshining gold. \"Ye want me to die,--I shan't--I shan't--give me my\ngold,\" clawing at the scattered sovereigns. \"I'll take it with me--I\nshan't die--G--G--\" whimpering. \"I ain't done nothin'--let me\nlive--give me a Bible--save me, G--cuss it--G--, G--.\" She fell back on\nthe bed, a corpse.\n\nThe faint light of the candle flickered on the shining gold, and on the\ndead face, framed in tangled white hair; while the three men, sick at\nheart, turned away in silence to seek assistance, with that wild cry\nstill ringing in their ears--\"G--save me, G--!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nMARK FRETTLBY HAS A VISITOR.\n\n\nAccording to the copy books of our youth, \"Procrastination is the thief\nof time.\" Now, Brian found the truth of this. He had been in town\nalmost a week, but he had not yet been to see Calton. Each morning--or\nsomething very near it--he set out, determined to go direct to Chancery\nLane, but he never arrived there. He had returned to his lodgings in\nEast Melbourne, and had passed his time either in the house or in the\ngarden. When perhaps business connected with the sale of his station\ncompelled his presence in town, he drove straight there and back.\nCuriously enough he shrank from meeting any of his friends. He felt\nkeenly his recent position in the prisoner's dock. And even when\nwalking by the Yarra, as he frequently did, he was conscious of an\nuneasy feeling--a feeling that he was an object of curiosity, and that\npeople turned to look at him out of a morbid desire to see one who had\nbeen so nearly hanged for murder.\n\nAs soon as his station should be sold and he married to Madge he\ndetermined to leave Australia, and never set foot on it again. But\nuntil he could leave the place he would see no one, nor would he mix\nwith his former friends, so great was his dread of being stared at.\nMrs. Sampson, who had welcomed him back with shrill exclamations of\ndelight, was loud in her expressions of disapproval as to the way he\nwas shutting himself up.\n\n\"Your eyes bein' 'ollow,\" said the sympathising cricket, \"it is nat'ral\nas it's want of air, which my 'usband's uncle, being a druggist, an'\nwell-to-do, in Collingwood, ses as 'ow a want of ox-eye-gent, being a\nFrench name, as 'e called the atmispeare, were fearful for pullin'\npeople down, an' makin' 'em go off their food, which you hardly eats\nanythin', an' not bein' a butterfly it's expected as your appetite\nwould be larger.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm all right,\" said Brian, absently, lighting a cigarette, and\nonly half listening to his landlady's garrulous chatter, \"but if anyone\ncalls tell them I'm not in. I don't want to be bothered by visitors.\"\n\n\"Bein' as wise a thing as Solomon ever said,\" answered Mrs. Sampson,\nenergetically, \"which, no doubt, 'e was in good 'ealth when seein' the\nQueen of Sheber, as is necessary when anyone calls, and not feelin'\ndisposed to speak, which I'm often that way myself on occasions, my\nsperits bein' low, as I've 'eard tell soder water 'ave that effect on\n'em, which you takes it with a dash of brandy, tho' to be sure that\nmight be the cause of your want of life, and--drat that bell,\" she\nfinished, hurrying out of the room as the front-door bell sounded,\n\"which my legs is a-givin' way under me thro' bein' overworked.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Brian sat and smoked contentedly, much relieved by the\ndeparture of Mrs. Sampson, with her constant chatter, but he soon heard\nher mount the stairs again, and she entered the room with a telegram,\nwhich she handed to her lodger.\n\n\"'Opin' it don't contain bad noose,\" she said as she retreated to the\ndoor again, \"which I don't like 'em 'avin' had a shock in early life\nthro' one 'avin' come unexpected, as my uncle's grandfather were dead,\n'avin' perished of consumption, our family all being disposed to the\ndisease--and now, if you'll excuse me, sir, I'll get to my dinner,\nbein' in the 'abit of takin' my meals reg'lar, and I studies my inside\ncarefully, bein' easily upset, thro' which I never could be a sailor.\"\n\nMrs. Sampson, having at last exhausted herself, went out of the room,\nand crackled loudly down the stairs, leaving Brian to read his\ntelegram. He tore open the envelope and found the message was from\nMadge, to say that they had returned, and to ask him to dine with them\nthat evening. Fitzgerald folded up the telegram, then rising from his\nseat, he walked moodily up and down the room with his hands in his\npockets.\n\n\"So he is there,\" said the young man aloud; \"and I shall have to meet\nhim and shake hands with him, knowing all the time what he is. If it\nwere not for Madge I'd leave this place at once, but after the way she\nstood by me in my trouble, I should be a coward if I did so.\"\n\nIt was as Madge had predicted--her father was unable to stay long in\none place, and had come back to Melbourne a week after Brian had\narrived. The pleasant party at the station was broken up, and, like the\ngraves of a household, the guests were scattered far and wide. Peterson\nhad left for New Zealand EN ROUTE for the wonders of the Hot Lakes, and\nthe old colonist was about to start for England in order to refresh his\nboyish memories. Mr. and Mrs. Rolleston had come back to Melbourne,\nwhere the wretched Felix was compelled once more to plunge into\npolitics; and Dr. Chinston had resumed his usual routine of fees and\npatients.\n\nMadge was glad to be back in Melbourne again, as now that her health\nwas restored she craved for the excitement of town life. It was now more\nthan three months since the murder, and the nine days' wonder was a\nthing of the past. The possibility of a war with Russia was the one\nabsorbing topic of the hour, and the colonists were busy preparing for\nthe attack of a possible enemy. As the Spanish Kings had drawn their\ntreasures from Mexico and Peru, so might the White Czar lay violent\nhands on the golden stores of Australia; but here there were no\nuncultured savages to face, but the sons and grandsons of men who had\ndimmed the glories of the Russian arms at Alma and Balaclava. So in the\nmidst of stormy rumours of wars the tragic fate of Oliver Whyte was\nquite forgotten. After the trial, everyone, including the detective\noffice, had given up the matter, and mentally relegated it to the list\nof undiscovered crimes. In spite of the utmost vigilance, nothing new\nhad been discovered, and it seemed likely that the assassin of Oliver\nWhyte would remain a free man. There were only two people in Melbourne\nwho still held the contrary opinion, and they were Calton and Kilsip.\nBoth these men had sworn to discover this unknown murderer, who struck\nhis cowardly blow in the dark, and though there seemed no possible\nchance of success, yet they worked on. Kilsip suspected Roger Moreland,\nthe boon companion of the dead man, but his suspicions were vague and\nuncertain, and there seemed little hope of verifying them. The\nbarrister did not as yet suspect any particular person, though the\ndeath-bed confession of Mother Guttersnipe had thrown a new light on\nthe subject, but he thought that when Fitzgerald told him the secret\nwhich Rosanna Moore had confided to his keeping, the real murderer\nwould soon be discovered, or, at least, some clue would be found that\nwould lead to his detection. So, as the matter stood at the time of\nMark Frettlby's return to Melbourne, Mr. Calton was waiting for\nFitzgerald's confession before making a move, while Kilsip worked\nstealthily in the dark, searching for evidence against Moreland.\n\nOn receiving Madge's telegram, Brian determined to go down in the\nevening, but not to dinner, so he sent a reply to Madge to that effect.\nHe did not want to meet Mark Frettlby, but did not of course, tell this\nto Madge, so she had her dinner by herself, as her father had gone to\nhis club, and the time of his return was uncertain. After dinner, she\nwrapped a light cloak round her, and repaired to the verandah to wait\nfor her lover. The garden looked charming in the moonlight, with the\nblack, dense cypress trees standing up against the sky, and the great\nfountain splashing cool and silvery. There was a heavily-foliaged oak\nby the gate, and she strolled down the path, and stood under it in the\nshadow, listening to the whisper and rustle of its multitudinous\nleaves. It is curious the unearthly glamour which moonlight seems to\nthrow over everything, and though Madge knew every flower, tree, and\nshrub in the garden, yet they all looked weird and fantastical in the\ncold, white light. She went up to the fountain, and seating herself on\nthe edge, amused herself by dipping her hand into the chilly water, and\nletting it fall, like silver rain, back into the basin. Then she heard\nthe iron gate open and shut with a clash, and springing to her feet,\nsaw someone coming up the path in a light coat and soft wide-awake hat.\n\n\"Oh, it's you at last, Brian?\" she cried, as she ran down the path to\nmeet him. \"Why did you not come before?\"\n\n\"Not being Brian, I can't say,\" answered her father's voice. Madge\nburst out laughing.\n\n\"What an absurd mistake,\" she cried. \"Why, I thought you were Brian.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"Yes; in that hat and coat I couldn't tell the difference in the\nmoonlight.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said her father, with a laugh, pushing his hat back, \"moonlight\nis necessary to complete the spell, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" answered his daughter. \"If there were no moonlight, alas,\nfor lovers!\"\n\n\"Alas, indeed!\" echoed her father. \"They would become as extinct as the\nmoa; but where are your eyes, Puss, when you take an old man like me\nfor your gay young Lochinvar?\"\n\n\"Well, really, papa,\" answered Madge, deprecatingly, \"you do look so\nlike him in that coat and hat that I could not tell the difference,\ntill you spoke.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, child,\" said Frettlby, roughly, \"you are fanciful;\" and\nturning on his heel, he walked rapidly towards the house, leaving Madge\nstaring after him in astonishment, as well she might, for her father\nhad never spoken to her so roughly before. Wondering at the cause of\nhis sudden anger, she stood spell-bound, until there came a step behind\nher, and a soft, low whistle. She turned with a scream, and saw Brian\nsmiling at her.\n\n\"Oh, it's you,\" she said, with a pout, as he caught her in his arms and\nkissed her.\n\n\"Only me,\" said Brian, ungrammatically; \"disappointing, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Oh, fearfully,\" answered the girl, with a gay laugh, as arm-in-arm\nthey walked towards the house. \"But do you know I made such a curious\nmistake just now; I thought papa was you.\"\n\n\"How strange,\" said Brian, absently, for indeed he was admiring her\ncharming face, which looked so pure and sweet in the moonlight.\n\n\"Yes, wasn't it?\" she replied. \"He had on a light coat and a soft hat,\njust like you wear sometimes, and as you are both the same height, I\ntook you for one another.\"\n\nBrian did not answer, but there was a cold feeling at his heart as he\nsaw a possibility of his worst suspicions being confirmed, for just at\nthat moment there came into his mind the curious coincidence of the man\nwho got into the hansom cab being dressed similarly to himself. What\nif--\"Nonsense,\" he said, aloud, rousing himself out of the train of\nthought the resemblance had suggested.\n\n\"I'm sure it isn't,\" said Madge, who had been talking about something\nelse for the last five minutes. \"You are a very rude young man.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Brian, waking up. \"You were saying--\"\n\n\"That the horse is the most noble of all animals--Exactly.\"\n\n\"I don't understand--\" began Brian, rather puzzled.\n\n\"Of course you don't,\" interrupted Madge, petulantly; \"considering I've\nbeen wasting my eloquence on a deaf man for the last ten minutes; and\nvery likely lame as well as deaf.\"\n\nAnd to prove the truth of the remark, she ran up the path with Brian\nafter her. He had a long chase of it, for Madge was nimble and better\nacquainted with the garden than he was but at last he caught her just\nas she was running up the steps into the house, and then--history\nrepeats itself.\n\nThey went into the drawing-room and found that Mr. Frettlby had gone up\nto his study, and did not want to be disturbed. Madge sat down to the\npiano, but before she struck a note, Brian took both her hands\nprisoners.\n\n\"Madge,\" he said, gravely, as she turned round, \"what did your father\nsay when you made that mistake?\"\n\n\"He was very angry,\" she answered. \"Quite cross; I'm sure I don't know\nwhy.\"\n\nBrian sighed as he released her hands, and was about to reply when the\nvisitor's bell sounded, they heard the servant answer it, and then\nsomeone was taken upstairs to Mr. Frettlby's study.\n\nWhen the footman came in to light the gas, Madge asked who it was that\nhad come to the door.\n\n\"I don't know, miss,\" he answered; \"he said he wanted to see Mr.\nFrettlby particularly, so I took him up to the study.\"\n\n\"But I thought that papa said he was not to be disturbed?\"\n\n\"Yes, miss, but the gentleman had an appointment with him.\"\n\n\"Poor papa,\" sighed Madge, turning again to the piano. \"He has always\ngot such a lot to do.\"\n\nLeft to themselves, Madge began playing Waldteufel's last new valse, a\ndreamy, haunting melody, with a touch of sadness in it, and Brian,\nlying lazily on the sofa, listened. Then she sang a gay little French\nsong about Love and a Butterfly, with a mocking refrain, which made\nBrian laugh.\n\n\"A memory of Offenbach,\" he said, rising and coming over to the piano.\n\"We certainly can't approach the French in writing these airy trifles.\"\n\n\"They're unsatisfactory, I think,\" said Madge, running her fingers over\nthe keys; \"they mean nothing.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" he replied, \"but don't you remember that De Quincy\nsays there is no moral either big or little in the Iliad.\"\n\n\"Well, I think there's more music in Barbara Allan than all those\nfrothy things,\" said Madge, with fine scorn. \"Come and sing it.\"\n\n\"A five-act funeral, it is,\" groaned Brian, as he rose to obey; \"let's\nhave Garry Owen instead.\"\n\nNothing else however would suit the capricious young person at the\npiano, so Brian, who had a pleasant voice, sang the quaint old ditty of\ncruel Barbara Allan, who treated her dying love with such disdain.\n\n\"Sir John Graham was an ass,\" said Brian, when he had finished; \"or,\ninstead of dying in such a silly manner, he'd have married her right\noff, without asking her permission.\"\n\n\"I don't think she was worth marrying,\" replied Madge, opening a book\nof Mendelssohn's duets; \"or she wouldn't have made such a fuss over her\nhealth not being drunk.\"\n\n\"Depend upon it, she was a plain woman,\" remarked Brian, gravely, \"and\nwas angry because she wasn't toasted among the rest of the country\nbelles. I think the young man had a narrow escape--she'd always have\nreminded him about that unfortunate oversight.\"\n\n\"You seem to have analysed her nature pretty well,\" said Madge, a\nlittle dryly; \"however, we'll leave the failings of Barbara Allan\nalone, and sing this.\"\n\nThis was Mendelssohn's charming duet, \"Would that my Love,\" which was a\ngreat favourite of Brian's. They were in the middle of it when suddenly\nMadge stopped, as she heard a loud cry, evidently proceeding from her\nfather's study. Recollecting Dr. Chinston's warning, she ran out of the\nroom, and upstairs, leaving Brian rather puzzled by her unceremonious\ndeparture, for though he had heard the cry, yet he did not attach much\nimportance to it.\n\nMadge knocked at the study door, and then she tried to open it, but it\nwas locked.\n\n\"Who's there?\" asked her father, sharply, from inside.\n\n\"Only me, papa,\" she answered. \"I thought you were--\"\n\n\"No! No--I'm all right,\" replied her father, quickly. \"Go down stairs,\nI'll join you shortly.\"\n\nMadge went back to the drawing-room only half satisfied with the\nexplanation. She found Brian waiting at the door, with rather an\nanxious face.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he asked, as she paused a moment at the foot of\nthe stairs.\n\n\"Papa says nothing,\" she replied, \"but I am sure he must have been\nstartled, or he would not have cried out like that.\"\n\nShe told him what Dr. Chinston had said about the state of her father's\nheart, a recital which shocked Brian greatly. They did not return to\nthe drawing-room, but went out on the verandah, where, after wrapping a\ncloak around Madge, Fitzgerald lit a cigarette. They sat down at the\nfar end of the verandah somewhat in the shadow, and could see the hall\ndoor wide open, and a warm flood of mellow light pouring therefrom, and\nbeyond the cold, white moonshine. After about a quarter of an hour,\nMadge's alarm about her father having somewhat subsided, they were\nchatting on indifferent subjects, when a man came out of the hall door,\nand paused for a moment on the steps of the verandah. He was dressed in\nrather a fashionable suit of clothes, but, in spite of the heat of the\nnight, he had a thick white silk scarf round his throat.\n\n\"That's rather a cool individual,\" said Brian, removing his cigarette\nfrom between his lips. \"I wonder what--Good God!\" he cried, rising to\nhis feet as the stranger turned round to look at the house, and took\noff his hat for a moment--\"Roger Moreland.\"\n\nThe man started, and looked quickly round into the dark shadow of the\nverandah where they were seated, then, putting on his hat, he ran\nquickly down the path, and they heard the gate clang after him.\n\nMadge felt a sudden fear at the expression on Brian's face, as revealed\nby a ray of moonlight streaming full on it.\n\n\"Who is Roger Moreland?\" she asked, touching his arm--\"Ah! I remember,\"\nwith sudden horror, \"Oliver Whyte's friend.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" in a hoarse whisper, \"and one of the witnesses at the trial.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nMR. CALTON'S CURIOSITY IS SATISFIED.\n\n\nThere was not much sleep for Brian that night. He left Madge almost\nimmediately, and went home, but he did not go to bed. He felt too\nanxious and ill at ease to sleep, and passed the greater part of the\nnight walking up and down his room, occupied with his own sad thoughts.\nHe was wondering in his own mind what could be the meaning of Roger\nMoreland's visit to Mark Frettlby. All the evidence that he had given\nat the trial was that he had met Whyte, and had been drinking with him\nduring the evening. Whyte then went out, and that was the last Moreland\nhad seen of him. Now, the question was, \"What did he go to see Mark\nFrettlby for?\" He had no acquaintance with him, and yet he called by\nappointment. It is true he might have been in poverty, and the\nmillionaire being well-known as an extremely generous man, Moreland\nmight have called on him for money. But then the cry which Frettlby had\ngiven after the interview had lasted a short time proved that he had\nbeen startled. Madge had gone upstairs and found the door locked, her\nfather refusing her admission. Now, why was he so anxious Moreland\nshould not be seen by any one? That he had made some startling\nrevelation was certain, and Fitzgerald felt sure that it was in\nconnection with the hansom cab murder case. He wearied himself with\nconjectures about the matter, and towards daybreak threw himself,\ndressed as he was, on the bed, and slept heavily till twelve o'clock\nthe next day. When he arose and looked at himself in the glass, he was\nstartled at the haggard and worn appearance of his face. The moment he\nwas awake his mind went back to Mark Frettlby and the visit of Roger\nMoreland.\n\n\"The net is closing round him,\" he murmured to himself. \"I don't see\nhow he can escape. Oh! Madge! Madge! if only I could spare you the\nbitterness of knowing what you must know, sooner or later, and that\nother unhappy girl--the sins of the fathers will be visited on the\nchildren--God help them.\"\n\nHe took his bath, and, after dressing himself, went into his\nsitting-room, where he had a cup of tea, which refreshed him\nconsiderably. Mrs. Sampson came crackling merrily upstairs with a\nletter, and gave vent to an exclamation of surprise, on seeing his\naltered appearance.\n\n\"Lor, sir!\" she exclaimed, \"what 'ave you bin a-doin'--me knowin' your\n'abits know'd as you'd gone to bed, not to say as it's very temptin' in\nthis 'ot weather, but with excuses, sir, you looks as if you 'adn't\nslept a blessed wink.\"\n\n\"No, more I have,\" said Brian, listlessly holding out his hand for the\nletter. \"I was walking up and down my room all last night--I must have\nwalked miles.\"\n\n\"Ah! 'ow that puts me in mind of my pore 'usband,\" chirped the cricket;\n\"bein' a printer, and accustomed like a howl to the darkness, when 'e\nwas 'ome for the night 'e walked up and down till 'e wore out the\ncarpet, bein' an expensive one, as I 'ad on my marriage, an' the only\nway I could stop 'im was by givin' 'im something soothin', which you,\nsir, ought to try--whisky 'ot, with lemon and sugar--but I've 'eard\ntell as chloroform--\"\n\n\"No, d-- it,\" said Brian, hastily, startled out of his politeness, \"I've\nhad enough of that.\"\n\n\"Achin' teeth, no doubt,\" said the landlady, going to the door, \"which\nI'm often taken that way myself, decayed teeth runnin' in the family,\ntho', to be sure, mine are stronger than former, a lodger of mine\n'avin' bin a dentist, an' doin' them beautiful, instead of payin' rent,\nnot avin' ready cash, his boxes bein' filled with bricks on 'is\ndeparture from the 'ouse.\"\n\nAs Brian did not appear particularly interested in these domestic\nreminiscences, and seemed as if he wanted to be left alone, Mrs.\nSampson, with a final crackle, went down stairs and talked with a\nneighbour in the kitchen, as to the desirability of drawing her money\nout of the Savings Bank, in case the Russians should surprise and\ncapture Melbourne. Brian, left alone, stared out of the window at the\ndusty road and the black shadows cast by the tall poplars in front of\nthe house.\n\n\"I must leave this place,\" he said to himself; \"every chance remark\nseems to bear on the murder, and I'm not anxious to have it constantly\nby my side like the skeleton at the feast.\"\n\nSuddenly he recollected the letter which he held in his hand, and which\nhe now looked at for the first time. It proved to be from Madge, and\ntearing it open hastily, he read it.\n\n\"I cannot understand what is the matter with papa,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Ever since that man Moreland left last night, he has shut himself up\nin his study, and is writing there hour after hour. I went up this\nmorning, but he would not let me in. He did not come down to breakfast,\nand I am getting seriously alarmed. Come down to-morrow and see me, for\nI am anxious about his state of health, and I am sure that Moreland\ntold him something which has upset him.\"\n\n\"Writing,\" said Brian, as he put the letter in his pocket, \"what about,\nI wonder? Perhaps he is thinking of committing suicide! if so, I for\none will not stop him. It is a horrible thing to do, but it would be\nacting for the best under the circumstances.\"\n\nIn spite of his determination to see Calton and tell all, Fitzgerald\ndid not go near him that day. He felt ill and weary, the want of sleep,\nand mental worry, telling on him terribly, and he looked ten years\nolder than he did before the murder of Whyte. It is trouble which draws\nlines on the smooth forehead and furrows round the mouth. If a man has\nany mental worry, his life becomes a positive agony to him. Mental\ntortures are quite as bad as physical ones, if not worse. The last\nthing before dropping off to sleep is the thought of trouble, and with\nthe first faint light of dawn, it returns and hammers all day at the\nweary brain. But while a man can sleep, life is rendered at least\nendurable; and of all the blessings which Providence has bestowed,\nthere is none so precious as that same sleep, which, as wise Sancho\nPanza says, \"Wraps every man like a cloak.\" Brian felt the need of\nrest, so sending a telegram to Calton to call on him in the morning,\nand another to Madge, that he would be down to luncheon next day, he\nstayed indoors all day, and amused himself with smoking and reading. He\nwent to bed early, and succeeded in having a sound sleep, so when he\nawoke next morning, he felt considerably refreshed and invigorated.\n\nHe was having his breakfast at half-past eight, when he heard the sound\nof wheels, and immediately afterwards a ring at the bell. He went to\nthe window, and saw Calton's trap was at the door. The owner was\nshortly afterwards shown into the room.\n\n\"Well, you are a nice fellow,\" cried Calton, after greetings were over.\n\"Here I've been waiting for you with all the patience of Job, thinking\nyou were still up country.\"\n\n\"Will you have some breakfast?\" asked Brian, laughing at his\nindignation.\n\n\"What have you got?\" said Calton, looking over the table. \"Ham and\neggs. Humph! Your landlady's culinary ideas are very limited.\"\n\n\"Most landladies' ideas are,\" retorted Fitzgerald, resuming his\nbreakfast. \"Unless Heaven invents some new animal, lodgers will go on\ngetting beef and mutton, alternated with hash, until the end of the\nworld.\"\n\n\"When one is in Rome, one musn't speak ill of the Pope,\" answered\nCalton, with a grimace. \"Do you think your landlady could supply me\nwith brandy and soda?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" answered Fitzgerald, rising, and ringing the bell; \"but\nisn't it rather early for that sort of thing?\"\n\n\"There's a proverb about glass houses,\" said Calton, severely, \"which\napplies to you in this particular instance.\"\n\nWhereupon Fitzgerald laughed, and Calton having been supplied with what\nhe required, prepared to talk business.\n\n\"I need hardly tell you how anxious I am to hear what you've got to\nsay,\" he said, leaning back in his chair, \"but I may as well tell you\nthat I am satisfied that I know half your secret already.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" Fitzgerald looked astonished. \"In that case, I need not--\"\n\n\"Yes, you need,\" retorted Calton. \"I told you I only know half.\"\n\n\"Which half?\"\n\n\"Hum--rather difficult to answer--however, I'll tell you what I know,\nand you can supply all deficiencies. I am quite ready--go on--stop--\"\nhe arose and closed the door carefully.\n\n\"Well,\" resuming his seat, \"Mother Guttersnipe died the other night.\"\n\n\"Is she dead?\"\n\n\"As a door nail,\" answered Calton calmly. \"And a horrible death-bed it\nwas--her screams ring in my ears yet--but before she died she sent for\nme, and said--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That she was the mother of Rosanna Moore.\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"And that Sal Rawlins was Rosanna's child.\"\n\n\"And the father?\" said Brian, in a low voice.\n\n\"Was Mark Frettlby.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"And now what have you to tell me?\"\n\n\"Nothing!\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" echoed Calton, surprised, \"then this is what Rosanna Moore\ntold you when she died?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"Then why have you made such a mystery about it?\"\n\n\"You ask that?\" said Fitzgerald, looking up, in surprise. \"If I had\ntold it, don't you see what difference it would have made to Madge?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't,\" retorted the barrister, completely mystified. \"I\nsuppose you mean Frettlby's connection with Rosanna Moore; well, of\ncourse, it was not a very creditable thing for her to have been\nFrettlby's mistress, but still--\"\n\n\"His mistress?\" said Fitzgerald, looking up sharply \"then you don't\nknow all.\"\n\n\"What do you mean--was she not his mistress?\"\n\n\"No--his wife!\" Calton sprang to his feet, and gave a cry of surprise.\n\n\"His wife!\"\n\nFitzgerald nodded.\n\n\"Why, Mother Guttersnipe did not know this--she thought Rosanna was his\nmistress.\"\n\n\"He kept his marriage secret,\" answered Brian, \"and as his wife ran\naway with someone else shortly afterwards, he never revealed it.\"\n\n\"I understand now,\" said the barrister, slowly. \"For if Mark Frettlby\nwas lawfully married to Rosanna Moore--Madge is illegitimate.\"\n\n\"Yes, and she now occupies the place which Sal Rawlins--or rather Sal\nFrettlby ought to.\"\n\n\"Poor girl,\" said Calton, a little sadly. \"But all this does not\nexplain the mystery of Whyte's murder.\"\n\n\"I will tell you that,\" said Fitzgerald, quickly. \"When Rosanna left\nher husband, she ran away to England with some young fellow, and when\nhe got tired of her she returned to the stage, and became famous as a\nburlesque actress, under the name of Musette. There she met Whyte, as\nyour friend found out, and they came out here for the purpose of\nextorting money from Frettlby. When they arrived in Melbourne, Rosanna\nlet Whyte do all the business, and kept herself quiet. She gave her\nmarriage certificate to Whyte, and he had it on him the night he was\nmurdered.\"\n\n\"Then Gorby was right,\" interposed Calton, eagerly. \"The man to whom\nthose papers were valuable did murder Whyte!\"\n\n\"Can you doubt it? And that man was--\"\n\n\"Not Mark Frettlby?\" burst out Calton. \"Surely not Mark Frettlby?\"\n\nBrian nodded, \"Yes, Mark Frettlby.\"\n\nThere was a silence for a few moments, Calton being too much startled\nby the revelation to say anything.\n\n\"When did you discover this?\" he asked, after a pause.\n\n\"At the time you first came to see me in prison,\" said Brian. \"I had no\nsuspicion till then; but when you said that Whyte was murdered for the\nsake of certain papers, I, knowing full well what they were and to whom\nthey were of value--guessed immediately that Mark Frettlby had killed\nWhyte in order to obtain them and to keep his secret.\"\n\n\"There can be no doubt of it,\" said the barrister, with a sigh. \"So\nthis is the reason Frettlby wanted Madge to marry Whyte--her hand was\nto be the price of his silence. When he withdrew his consent, Whyte\nthreatened him with exposure. I remember he left the house in a very\nexcited state on the night he was murdered. Frettlby must have followed\nhim up to town, got into the cab with him, and after killing him with\nchloroform, must have taken the marriage certificate from his secret\npocket, and escaped.\"\n\nBrian rose to his feet, and walked rapidly up and down the room.\n\n\"Now you can understand what a hell my life has been for the last few\nmonths,\" he said, \"knowing that he had committed the crime; and yet I\nhad to sit with him, eat with him, and drink with him, with the\nknowledge that he was a murderer, and Madge--Madge, his daughter!\"\n\nJust then a knock came to his door, and Mrs. Sampson entered with a\ntelegram, which she handed to Brian. He tore it open as she withdrew,\nand glancing over it, gave a cry of horror, and let it flutter to his\nfeet.\n\nCalton turned rapidly on hearing his cry, and seeing him fall into a\nchair with a white face, snatched up the telegram and read it. When he\ndid so, his face grew as pale and startled as Fitzgerald's, and lifting\nhis hand, he said solemnly--\n\n\"It is the judgment of God!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nNEMESIS.\n\n\nMen, according to the old Greek, \"are the sport of the gods,\" who,\nenthroned on high Olympus, put evil desires into the hearts of mortals;\nand when evil actions were the outcome of evil thoughts, amused\nthemselves by watching the ineffectual efforts made by their victims to\nescape a relentless deity called Nemesis, who exacted a penalty for\ntheir evil deeds. It was no doubt very amusing--to the gods--but it is\nquestionable if the men found it so. They had their revenge, however,\nfor weary of plaguing puny mortals, who whimpered and cried when they\nsaw they could not escape, the inevitable Nemesis turned her attention\nfrom actors to spectators, and made a clean sweep of the whole Olympian\nhierarchy. She smashed their altars, pulled down their statues, and\nafter she had completed her malicious work, found that she had,\nvulgarly speaking, been cutting off her nose to spite her face, for\nshe, too, became an object of derision and of disbelief, and was forced\nto retire to the same obscurity to which she had relegated the other\ndeities. But men found out that she had not been altogether useless as\na scapegoat upon which to lay the blame of their own shortcomings, so\nthey created a new deity called Fate, and laid any misfortune which\nhappened to them to her charge. Her worship is still very popular,\nespecially among lazy and unlucky people, who never bestir themselves:\non the ground that whether they do so or not their lives are already\nsettled by Fate. After all, the true religion of Fate has been preached\nby George Eliot, when she says that our lives are the outcome of our\nactions. Set up any idol you please upon which to lay the blame of\nunhappy lives and baffled ambitions, but the true cause is to be found\nin men themselves. Every action, good or bad, which we do has its\ncorresponding reward, and Mark Frettlby found it so, for the sins of\nhis youth were now being punished in his old age. No doubt he had\nsinned gaily enough in that far-off time when life's cup was still\nbrimming with wine, and no asp hid among the roses; but Nemesis had\nbeen an unseen spectator of all his thoughtless actions, and now she\ncame to demand her just dues. He felt somewhat as Faust must have felt\nwhen Mephistopheles suggested a visit to Hades, in repayment of those\nyears of magic youth and magic power. So long ago it seemed since he\nhad married Rosanna Moore, that he almost persuaded himself that it had\nbeen only a dream--a pleasant dream, with a disagreeable awakening.\nWhen she had left him he had tried to forget her, recognising how\nunworthy she was of a good man's love. He heard that she had died in a\nLondon hospital, and with a passionate sigh for a perished love, he had\ndismissed her from his thoughts for ever. His second marriage had\nturned out a happy one, and he regretted the death of his wife deeply.\nAfterwards, all his love centred in his daughter, and he thought he\nwould be able to spend his declining years in peace. This, however, was\nnot to be, and he was thunderstruck when Whyte arrived from England\nwith the information that his first wife still lived, and that the\ndaughter of his second was illegitimate. Sooner than risk exposure,\nFrettlby agreed to anything; but Whyte's demands became too exorbitant,\nand he refused to comply with them. On Whyte's death he again breathed\nfreely, when suddenly a second possessor of his fatal secret started up\nin the person of Roger Moreland. As the murder of Duncan had to be\nfollowed by that of Banquo, in order to render Macbeth safe, so he\nforesaw that while Roger Moreland lived his life would be one long\nmisery. He knew that the friend of the murdered man would be his\nmaster, and would never leave him during his life, while after his\ndeath he would probably publish the whole ghastly story, and defame the\nmemory of the widely-respected Mark Frettlby. What is it that\nShakespeare says?--\n\n  \"Good name in man or woman\n  Is the immediate jewel of their souls.\"\n\n\nAnd after all these years of spotless living and generous use of his\nwealth, was he to be dragged down to the depths of infamy and\ndegradation by a man like Moreland? Already, in fancy, he heard the\njeering cries of his fellow-men, and saw the finger of scorn point at\nhim--he, the great Mark Frettlby, famous throughout Australia for his\nhonesty, integrity, and generosity. No, it could not be, and yet this\nwould surely happen unless he took means to prevent it.\n\nThe day after he had seen Moreland, and knew that his secret was no\nlonger safe, since it was in the power of a man who might reveal it at\nany moment in a drunken fit, or out of sheer maliciousness, he sat at\nhis desk writing. After a time he laid down his pen, and taking up a\nportrait of his dead wife which stood just in front of him, he stared\nat it long and earnestly. As he did so, his mind went back to the time\nwhen he had first met and loved her. Even as Faust had entered into the\npurity and serenity of Gretchen's chamber, out of the coarseness and\nprofligacy of Auerbach's cellar, so he, leaving behind him the wild\nlife of his youth, had entered into the peace and quiet of a domestic\nhome. The old feverish life with Rosanna Moore, seemed to be as\nunsubstantial and chimerical, as, no doubt, his union with Lillith\nafter he met Eve, seemed to Adam in the old Rabbinical legend. There\nseemed to be only one way open to him, by which he could escape the\nrelentless fate which dogged his steps. He would write a confession of\neverything from the time he had first met Rosanna, and then--death. He\nwould cut the Gordian knot of all his difficulties, and then his secret\nwould be safe; safe? no, it could not be while Moreland lived. When he\nwas dead Moreland would see Madge and embitter her life with the story\nof her father's sins--yes--he must live to protect her, and drag his\nweary chain of bitter remembrance through life, always with that\nterrible sword of Damocles hanging over him. But still, he would write\nout his confession, and after his death, whenever it may happen, it\nmight help if not altogether to exculpate, at least to secure some pity\nfor a man who had been hardly dealt with by Fate. His resolution taken,\nhe put it into force at once, and sat all day at his desk filling page\nafter page with the history of his past life, which was so bitter to\nhim. He started at first languidly, and as in the performance of an\nunpleasant but necessary duty. Soon, however, he became interested in\nit, and took a peculiar pleasure in putting down every minute\ncircumstance which made the case stronger against himself. He dealt\nwith it, not as a criminal, but as a prosecutor, and painted his\nconduct as much blacker than it really had been. Towards the end of the\nday, however, after reading over the earlier sheets, he experienced a\nrevulsion of feeling, seeing how severe he had been on himself, so he\nwrote a defence of his conduct, showing that fate had been too strong\nfor him. It was a weak argument to bring forward, but still he felt it\nwas the only one that he could make. It was quite dark when he had\nfinished, and while sitting in the twilight, looking dreamily at the\nsheets scattered all over his desk, he heard a knock at the door, and\nhis daughter's voice asking if he was coming to dinner. All day long he\nhad closed his door against everyone, but now his task being ended, he\ncollected all the closely-written sheets together, placed them in a\ndrawer of his escritoire, which he locked, and then opened the door.\n\n\"Dear papa,\" cried Madge, as she entered rapidly, and threw her arms\naround his neck, \"what have you been doing here all day by yourself?\"\n\n\"Writing,\" returned her father laconically, as he gently removed her\narms.\n\n\"Why, I thought you were ill,\" she answered, looking at him\napprehensively.\n\n\"No, dear,\" he replied, quietly. \"Not ill, but worried.\"\n\n\"I knew that dreadful man who came last night had told you something to\nworry you. Who is he?\"\n\n\"Oh! a friend of mine,\" answered Frettlby, with hesitation.\n\n\"What--Roger Moreland?\"\n\nHer father started.\n\n\"How do you know it was Roger Moreland?\"\n\n\"Oh! Brian recognised him as he went out.\"\n\nMark Frettlby hesitated for a few moments, and then busied himself with\nthe papers on his desk, as he replied in a low voice--\n\n\"You are right--it was Roger Moreland--he is very hard up, and as he\nwas a friend of poor Whyte's, he asked me to assist him, which I did.\"\n\nHe hated to hear himself telling such a deliberate falsehood, but there\nwas no help for it--Madge must never know the truth so long as he could\nconceal it.\n\n\"Just like you,\" said Madge, kissing him lightly with filial pride.\n\"The best and kindest of men.\"\n\nHe shivered slightly as he felt her caress, and thought how she would\nrecoil from him did she know all. \"After all,\" says some cynical\nwriter, \"the illusions of youth are mostly due to the want of\nexperience.\" Madge, ignorant in a great measure of the world, cherished\nher pleasant illusions, though many of them had been destroyed by the\ntrials of the past year, and her father longed to keep her in this\nframe of mind.\n\n\"Now go down to dinner, my dear,\" he said, leading her to the door. \"I\nwill follow soon.\"\n\n\"Don't be long,\" replied his daughter, \"or I shall come up again,\" and\nshe ran down the stairs, her heart feeling strangely light.\n\nHer father looked after her until she vanished, then heaving a\nregretful sigh returned to his study, and taking out the scattered\npapers fastened them together, and endorsed them.\n\n\"My Confession.\" He then placed them in an envelope, sealed it, and put\nit back in the desk. \"If all that is in that packet were known,\" he\nsaid aloud, as he left the room, \"what would the world say?\"\n\nThat night he was singularly brilliant at the dinner table. Generally a\nvery reticent and grave man, on this night he laughed and talked so\ngaily that the very servants noticed the change. The fact was he felt a\nsense of relief at having unburdened his mind, and felt as though by\nwriting out that confession he had laid the spectre which had haunted\nhim for so long. His daughter was delighted at the change in his\nspirits, but the old Scotch nurse, who had been in the house since\nMadge was a baby, shook her head--\n\n\"He's fey,\" she said gravely. \"He's no lang for the warld.\"\n\nOf course she was laughed at--people who believe in presentiments\ngenerally are--but, nevertheless, she held firmly to her opinion.\n\nMr. Frettlby went to bed early that night, the excitement of the last\nfew days and the feverish gaiety in which he had lately indulged\nproving too strong for him. No sooner had he laid his head on his\npillow than he dropped off to sleep at once, and forgot in placid\nslumber the troubles and worries of his waking hours.\n\nIt was only nine o'clock, so Madge stayed by herself in the great\ndrawing-room, and read a new novel, which was then creating a\nsensation, called \"Sweet Violet Eyes.\" It belied its reputation,\nhowever, for it was very soon thrown on the table with a look of\ndisgust, and rising from her seat Madge walked up and down the room,\nand wished some good fairy would hint to Brian that he was wanted. If\nman is a gregarious animal, how much more, then, is a woman? This is\nnot a conundrum, but a simple truth. \"A female Robinson Crusoe,\" says a\nwriter who prided himself upon being a keen observer of human\nnature--\"a female Robinson Crusoe would have gone mad for want of\nsomething to talk to.\" This remark, though severe, nevertheless\ncontains several grains of truth, for women, as a rule, talk more than\nmen. They are more sociable, and a Miss Misanthrope, in spite of Justin\nMcCarthy's, is unknown--at least in civilised communities. Miss\nFrettlby, being neither misanthropic nor dumb, began to long for some\none to talk to, and, ringing the bell, ordered Sal to be sent in. The\ntwo girls had become great friends, and Madge, though by two years the\nyounger, assumed the ROLE of mentor, and under her guidance Sal was\nrapidly improving. It was a strange irony of fate which brought\ntogether these two children of the same father, each with such\ndifferent histories--the one reared in luxury and affluence, never\nhaving known want; the other dragged up in the gutter, all unsexed and\nbesmirched by the life she had led. \"The whirligig of time brings in\nits revenges,\" and it was the last thing in the world Mark Frettlby\nwould have thought of seeing: Rosanna Moore's child, whom he fancied\ndead, under the same roof as his daughter Madge.\n\nOn receiving Madge's message Sal came to the drawing room, and the two\nwere soon chatting amicably together. The room was almost in darkness,\nonly one lamp being lighted, Mr. Frettlby very sensibly detested gas,\nwith its glaring light, and had nothing but lamps in his drawing-room.\nAt the end of the apartment, where Sal and Madge were seated, there was\na small table. On it stood a large lamp, with an opaque globe, which,\nhaving a shade over it, threw a soft and subdued circle of light round\nthe table, leaving the rest of the room in a kind of semi-darkness.\nNear this sat Madge and Sal, talking gaily, and away on the left-hand\nside they could see the door open, and a warm flood of light pouring in\nfrom the hall.\n\nThey had been talking together for some time, when Sal's quick ear\ncaught a footfall on the soft carpet, and, turning rapidly, she saw a\ntall figure advancing down the room. Madge saw it too, and started up\nin surprise on recognising her father. He was clothed in his\ndressing-gown, and carried some papers in his hand.\n\n\"Why, papa,\" said Madge, in surprise. \"I--\"\n\n\"Hush!\" whispered Sal, grasping her arms. \"He's asleep.\"\n\nAnd so he was. In accordance with the dictates of the excited brain,\nthe weary body had risen from the bed and wandered about the house. The\ntwo girls, drawing back into the shadow, watched him with bated breath\nas he came slowly down the room. In a few moments he was within the\ncircle of light, and, moving noiselessly along, he laid the papers he\ncarried on the table. They were in a large blue envelope much worn,\nwith writing in red ink on it. Sal recognised it at once as the one\nshe had seen in the possession of the dead woman, and with an\ninstinctive feeling that there was something wrong, she tried to draw\nMadge back, as she watched her father's action with an intensity of\nfeeling which held her spell-bound. Frettlby opened the envelope, and\ntook therefrom a yellow, frayed piece of paper, which he spread out on\nthe table. Madge bent forward to see it, but Sal, with a sudden terror\ndrew her back.\n\n\"For God's sake no,\" she cried.\n\nBut it was too late; Madge had caught sight of the names on the\npaper--\"Marriage--Rosanna Moore--Mark Frettlby\"--and the whole awful\ntruth flashed upon her. These were the papers Rosanna Moore had handed\nto Whyte. Whyte had been murdered by the man to whom the papers were of\nvalue--\n\n\"Oh! My father!\"\n\nShe staggered blindly forward, and then, with one piercing shriek, fell\nto the ground. In doing so, she struck against her father, who was\nstill standing beside the table. Awakened suddenly, with that wild cry\nin his ears, he opened his eyes wide, put out feeble hands, as if to\nkeep something back, and with a strangled cry fell dead on the floor\nbeside his daughter. Sal, horror-struck, did not lose her presence of\nmind, but, snatching the papers off the table, she thrust them into her\npocket, and then called aloud for the servants. But they, already\nattracted by Madge's wild cry, came hurrying in, to find Mark Frettlby,\nthe millionaire, lying dead, and his daughter in a faint beside her\nfather's corpse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nHUSH-MONEY.\n\n\nAs soon as Brian received the telegram which announced the death of\nMark Frettlby, he put on his hat, stepped into Calton's trap, and drove\nalong to the St. Kilda station in Flinders Street with that gentleman.\nThere Calton dismissed his trap, sending a note to his clerk with the\ngroom, and went down to St. Kilda with Fitzgerald. On arrival they\nfound the whole house perfectly quiet and orderly, owing to the\nexcellent management of Sal Rawlins. She had taken the command in\neverything, and although the servants, knowing her antecedents, were\ndisposed to resent her doing so, yet such were her administrative\npowers and strong will, that they obeyed her implicitly. Mark\nFrettlby's body had been taken up to his bedroom, Madge had been put to\nbed, and Dr. Chinston and Brian sent for. When they arrived they could\nnot help expressing their admiration at the capital way in which Sal\nRawlins had managed things.\n\n\"She's a clever girl that,\" whispered Calton to Fitzgerald. \"Curious\nthing she should have taken up her proper position in her father's\nhouse. Fate is a deal cleverer than we mortals think her.\"\n\nBrian was about to reply when Dr. Chinston entered the room. His face\nwas very grave, and Fitzgerald looked at him in alarm.\n\n\"Madge--Miss Frettlby,\" he faltered.\n\n\"Is very ill,\" replied the doctor; \"has an attack of brain fever. I\ncan't answer for the consequences yet.\"\n\nBrian sat down on the sofa, and stared at the doctor in a dazed sort of\nway. Madge dangerously ill--perhaps dying. What if she were to die, and\nhe to lose the true-hearted woman who stood so nobly by him in his\ntrouble?\n\n\"Cheer up,\" said Chinston, patting him on the shoulder; \"while there's\nlife there's hope, and whatever human aid can do to save her will be\ndone.\"\n\nBrian grasped the doctor's hand in silence, his heart being too full to\nspeak.\n\n\"How did Frettlby die?\" asked Calton.\n\n\"Heart disease,\" said Chinston. \"His heart was very much affected, as I\ndiscovered a week or so ago. It appears he was walking in his sleep,\nand entering the drawing-room, he alarmed Miss Frettlby, who screamed,\nand must have touched him. He awoke suddenly, and the natural\nconsequences followed--he dropped down dead.\"\n\n\"What alarmed Miss Frettlby?\" asked Brian, in a low voice, covering his\nface with his hand.\n\n\"The sight of her father walking in his sleep, I suppose,\" said\nChinston, buttoning his glove; \"and the shock of his death which took\nplace indirectly through her, accounts for the brain fever.\"\n\n\"Madge Frettlby is not the woman to scream and waken a somnambulist,\"\nsaid Calton, decidedly, \"knowing as she did the danger. There must be\nsome other reason.\"\n\n\"This young woman will tell you all about it,\" said Chinston, nodding\ntowards Sal, who entered the room at this moment. \"She was present, and\nsince then has managed things admirably; and now I must go,\" he said,\nshaking hands with Calton and Fitzgerald. \"Keep up your heart, my boy;\nI'll pull her through yet.\"\n\nAfter the doctor had gone, Calton turned sharply to Sal Rawlins, who\nstood waiting to be addressed.\n\n\"Well,\" he said briskly, \"can you tell us what startled Miss Frettlby?\"\n\n\"I can, sir,\" she answered quietly. \"I was in the drawing-room when Mr.\nFrettlby died--but--we had better go up to the study.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Calton, in surprise, as he and Fitzgerald followed her up\nstairs.\n\n\"Because, sir,\" she said, when they had entered the study and she had\nlocked the door, \"I don't want any one but yourselves to know what I\ntell you.\"\n\n\"More mystery,\" muttered Calton, as he glanced at Brian, and took his\nseat at the escritoire.\n\n\"Mr. Frettlby went to bed early last night,\" said Sal, calmly, \"and\nMiss Madge and I were talking together in the drawing-room, when he\nentered, walking in his sleep, and carrying some papers--\"\n\nBoth Calton and Fitzgerald started, and the latter grew pale.\n\n\"He came down the room, and spread out a paper on the table where the\nlamp was. Miss Madge bent forward to see what it was. I tried to stop\nher, but it was too late. She gave a scream, and fell on the floor. In\ndoing so she happened to touch her father. He awoke, and fell down\ndead.\"\n\n\"And the papers?\" asked Calton, uneasily.\n\nSal did not answer, but producing them from her pocket, laid them in\nhis hands.\n\nBrian bent forward, as Calton opened the envelope in silence, but both\ngave vent to an exclamation of horror at seeing the certificate of\nmarriage which they knew Rosanna Moore had given to Whyte. Their worst\nsuspicions were confirmed, and Brian turned away his head, afraid to\nmeet the barrister's eye. The latter folded up the papers thoughtfully,\nand put them in his pocket.\n\n\"You know what these are?\" he asked Sal, eyeing her keenly.\n\n\"I could hardly help knowing,\" she answered; \"it proves that Rosanna\nMoore was Mr. Frettlby's wife, and--\" she hesitated.\n\n\"Go on,\" said Brian, in a harsh tone, looking up.\n\n\"And they were the papers she gave Mr. Whyte.\"\n\n\"Well!\"\n\nSal was silent for a moment, and then looked up with a flush.\n\n\"You needn't think I'm going to split,\" she said, indignantly,\nrecurring to her Bourke Street slang in the excitement of the moment.\n\"I know what you know, but I'll be as silent as the grave.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Brian, fervently, taking her hand; \"I know you love\nher too well to betray this terrible secret.\"\n\n\"I would be a nice 'un, I would,\" said Sal, with a scorn, \"after her\nlifting me out of the gutter, to round on her--a poor girl like me,\nwithout a friend or a relative, now Gran's dead.\"\n\nCalton looked up quickly. It was plain Sal was quite ignorant that\nRosanna Moore was her mother. So much the better; they would keep her\nin ignorance, perhaps not altogether, but it would be folly to\nundeceive her at present.\n\n\"I'm goin' to Miss Madge now,\" she said, going to the door, \"and I\nwon't see you again; she's getting light-headed, and might let it out;\nbut I'll not let any one in but myself,\" and so saying, she left the\nroom.\n\n\"Cast thy bread upon the waters,\" said Calton, oracularly. \"The\nkindness of Miss Frettlby to that poor waif is already bearing\nfruit--gratitude is the rarest of qualities, rarer even than modesty.\"\n\nFitzgerald made no answer, but stared out of the window, and thought of\nhis darling lying sick unto death, and he able to do nothing to save\nher.\n\n\"Well,\" said Calton, sharply.\n\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon,\" said Fitzgerald, turning in confusion. \"I\nsuppose the will must be read, and all that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the barrister, \"I am one of the executors.\"\n\n\"And the others?\"\n\n\"Yourself and Chinston,\" answered Calton; \"so I suppose,\" turning to\nthe desk, \"we can look at his papers, and see that all is straight.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose so,\" replied Brian, mechanically, his thoughts far\naway, and then he turned again to the window. Suddenly Calton gave vent\nto an exclamation of surprise, and, turning hastily, Brian saw him\nholding a thick roll of papers in his hand, which he had taken out of\nthe drawer.\n\n\"Look here, Fitzgerald,\" he said, greatly excited, \"here is Frettlby's\nconfession--look!\" and he held it up.\n\nBrian sprang forward in astonishment. So at last the hansom cab mystery\nwas to be cleared up. These sheets, no doubt, contained the whole\nnarration of the crime, and how it was committed.\n\n\"We will read it, of course,\" he said, hesitating, half hoping that\nCalton would propose to destroy it at once.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Calton; \"the three executors must read it, and then--we\nwill burn it.\"\n\n\"That will be the better way,\" answered Brian, gloomily. \"Frettlby is\ndead, and the law can do nothing in the matter, so it would be best to\navoid the scandal of publicity. But why tell Chinston?\"\n\n\"We must,\" said Calton, decidedly. \"He will be sure to gather the truth\nfrom Madge's ravings, and he may as well know all. He is quite safe,\nand will be silent as the grave. But I am more sorry to tell Kilsip.\"\n\n\"The detective? Good God, Calton, surely you will not do so!\"\n\n\"I must,\" replied the barrister, quietly. \"Kilsip is firmly persuaded\nthat Moreland committed the crime, and I have the same dread of his\npertinacity as you had of mine. He may find out all.\"\n\n\"What must be, must be,\" said Fitzgerald, clenching his hands. \"But I\nhope no one else will find out this miserable story. There's Moreland,\nfor instance.\"\n\n\"Ah, true!\" said Calton, thoughtfully. \"He called and saw Frettlby the\nother night, you say?\"\n\n\"Yes. I wonder what for?\"\n\n\"There is only one answer,\" said the barrister, slowly. \"He must have\nseen Frettlby following Whyte when he left the hotel, and wanted\nhush-money.\"\n\n\"I wonder if he got it?\" observed Fitzgerald.\n\n\"Oh, I'll soon find that out,\" answered Calton, opening the drawer\nagain, and taking out the dead man's cheque-book. \"Let me see what\ncheques have been drawn lately.\"\n\nMost of the blocks were filled up for small amounts, and one or two for\na hundred or so. Calton could find no large sum such as Moreland would\nhave demanded, when, at the very end of the book, he found a cheque\ntorn off, leaving the block-slip quite blank.\n\n\"There you are,\" he said, triumphantly holding out the book to\nFitzgerald. \"He wasn't such a fool as to write in the amount on the\nblock, but tore the cheque out, and wrote in the sum required.\"\n\n\"And what's to be done about it?\"\n\n\"Let him keep it, of course,\" answered Calton, shrugging his shoulders.\n\"It's the only way to secure his silence.\"\n\n\"I expect he cashed it yesterday, and is off by this time,\" said Brian,\nafter a moment's pause.\n\n\"So much the better for us,\" said Calton, grimly. \"But I don't think\nhe's off, or Kilsip would have let me know. We must tell him, or he'll\nget everything out of Moreland, and the consequences will be that all\nMelbourne will know the story; whereas, by showing him the confession,\nwe get him to leave Moreland alone, and thus secure silence in both\ncases.\"\n\n\"I suppose we must see Chinston?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course. I will telegraph to him and Kilsip to come up to my\noffice this afternoon at three o'clock, and then we will settle the\nwhole matter.\"\n\n\"And Sal Rawlins?\"\n\n\"Oh! I quite forgot about her,\" said Calton, in a perplexed voice. \"She\nknows nothing about her parents, and, of course, Mark Frettlby died in\nthe belief that she was dead.\"\n\n\"We must tell Madge,\" said Brian, gloomily. \"There is no help for it.\nSal is by rights the heiress to the money of her dead father.\"\n\n\"That depends upon the will,\" replied Calton, dryly. \"If it specifies\nthat the money is left to 'my daughter, Margaret Frettlby,' Sal Rawlins\ncan have no claim; and if such is the case, it will be no good telling\nher who she is.\"\n\n\"And what's to be done?\"\n\n\"Sal Rawlins,\" went on the barrister, without noticing the\ninterruption, \"has evidently never given a thought to her father or\nmother, as the old hag, no doubt, swore they were dead. So I think it\nwill be best to keep silent--that is, if no money is left to her, and,\nas her father thought her dead, I don't think there will be any. In\nthat case, it would be best to settle an income on her. You can easily\nfind a pretext, and let the matter rest.\"\n\n\"But suppose, in accordance with the wording of the will, she is\nentitled to all the money?\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Calton, gravely, \"there is only one course\nopen--she must be told everything, and the dividing of the money left\nto her generosity. But I don't think you need be alarmed, I'm pretty\nsure Madge is the heiress.\"\n\n\"It's not the money I think about,\" said Brian, hastily. \"I'd take\nMadge without a penny.\"\n\n\"My boy,\" said the barrister, placing his hand kindly on Brian's\nshoulder, \"when you marry Madge Frettlby, you will get what is better\nthan money--a heart of gold.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nDE MORTUIS NIL NISI BONUM.\n\n\n\"Nothing is certain but the unforeseen;\" so says a French proverb, and\njudging from the unexpected things which daily happen to us, it is\nwithout doubt a very true one. If anyone had told Madge Frettlby one\nday that she would be stretched on a bed of sickness the next, and\nwould be quite oblivious of the world and its doings, she would have\nlaughed the prophet to scorn. Yet it was so, and she was tossing and\nturning on a bed of pain to which the couch of Procustes was one of\nroses. Sal sat beside her, ever watchful of her wants, and listened\nthrough the bright hours of the day, or the still ones of the night, to\nthe wild and incoherent words which issued from her lips. She\nincessantly called on her father to save himself, and then would talk\nabout Brian, and sing snatches of song, or would sob broken sentences\nabout her dead mother, until the heart of the listener ached to hear\nher. No one was allowed into the room except Sal, and when Dr. Chinston\nheard the things she was saying, although used to such cases, he\nrecoiled.\n\n\"There is blood on your hands,\" cried Madge, sitting up in bed, with\nher hair all tangled and falling over her shoulders; \"red blood, and\nyou cannot wash it off. Oh, Cain! God save him! Brian, you are not\nguilty; my father killed him. God! God!\" and she fell back on her\ndisordered pillows weeping bitterly.\n\nDr. Chinston did not say anything, but shortly afterwards took his\nleave, after telling Sal on no account to let anyone see the patient.\n\n\"'Tain't likely,\" said Sal, in a disgusted tone, as she closed the door\nafter him. \"I'm not a viper to sting the bosom as fed me,\" from which\nit may be gathered she was advancing rapidly in her education.\n\nMeanwhile Dr. Chinston had received Calton's telegram, and was\nconsiderably astonished thereat. He was still more so when, on arriving\nat the office at the time appointed, he found Calton and Fitzgerald\nwere not alone, but a third man whom he had never seen was with them.\nThe latter Calton introduced to him as Mr. Kilsip, of the detective\noffice, a fact which made the worthy doctor uneasy, as he could in no\nwise divine the meaning of it. However, he made no remark, but took the\nseat handed to him by Mr. Calton and prepared to listen. Calton locked\nthe door of the office, and then went back to his desk, having the\nother three seated before him in a kind of semi-circle.\n\n\"In the first place,\" said Calton to the doctor, \"I have to inform you\nthat you are one of the executors under the will of the late Mr.\nFrettlby, and that is why I asked you to come here to-day. The other\nexecutors are Mr. Fitzgerald and myself.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed,\" murmured the doctor, politely.\n\n\"And now,\" said Calton, looking at him, \"do you remember the hansom cab\nmurder, which caused such a sensation some months ago?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" replied the doctor, rather astonished; \"but what has that\nto do with the will?\"\n\n\"Nothing to do with the will,\" answered Calton, gravely; \"but the fact\nis, Mr. Frettlby was implicated in the affair.\"\n\nDr. Chinston glanced enquiringly at Brian, but that gentleman shook his\nhead.\n\n\"It has nothing to do with my arrest,\" he said, sadly.\n\nMadge's words, uttered in her delirium, flashed across the doctor's\nmemory.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he gasped, pushing back his chair. \"How was he\nimplicated?\"\n\n\"That I cannot tell you,\" answered Calton, \"until I read his\nconfession.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Kilsip, becoming very attentive.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Calton, turning to Kilsip, \"your hunt after Moreland is a\nwild-goose chase, for the murderer of Oliver Whyte is discovered.\"\n\n\"Discovered!\" cried Kilsip and the doctor in one breath.\n\n\"Yes, and his name is Mark Frettlby.\"\n\nKilsip shot a glance of disdain out of his bright black eyes, and gave\na low laugh of disbelief, but the doctor pushed back his chair\nfuriously, and arose to his feet.\n\n\"This is monstrous,\" he cried, in a rage. \"I won't sit still and hear\nthis accusation against my dead friend.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, it is too true,\" said Brian, sadly.\n\n\"How dare you say so?\" said Chinston, turning angrily on him. \"And you\ngoing to marry his daughter!\"\n\n\"There is only one way to settle the question,\" said Calton, coldly.\n\"We must read his confession.\"\n\n\"But why the detective?\" asked the doctor, ungraciously, as he took his\nseat.\n\n\"Because I want him to hear for himself that Mr. Frettlby committed the\ncrime, that he may keep silence.\"\n\n\"Not till I've arrested him,\" said Kilsip, determinedly.\n\n\"But he's dead,\" said Brian.\n\n\"I'm speaking of Roger Moreland,\" retorted Kilsip. \"For he and no other\nmurdered Oliver Whyte.\"\n\n\"That's a much more likely story,\" Chinston said.\n\n\"I tell you no,\" said Calton, vehemently. \"God knows I would like to\npreserve Mark Frettlby's good name, and it is with this object I have\nbrought you all together. I will read the confession, and when you know\nthe truth, I want you all to keep silent about it, as Mark Frettlby is\ndead, and the publication of his crime can do no good to anyone.\"\n\n\"I know,\" resumed Calton, addressing the detective, \"that you are fully\nconvinced in your own mind that you are right and I am wrong, but what\nif I tell you that Mark Frettlby died holding those very papers for the\nsake of which the crime was committed?\"\n\nKilsip's face lengthened considerably.\n\n\"What were the papers?\"\n\n\"The marriage certificate of Mark Frettlby and Rosanna Moore, the woman\nwho died in the back slum.\"\n\nKilsip was not often astonished; but he was so now. And Dr. Chinston\nfell back in his chair, staring at the barrister in blank amazement.\n\n\"And what's more,\" went on Calton, triumphantly, \"do you know that\nMoreland went to Frettlby two nights ago and obtained a certain sum for\nhush-money?\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Kilsip.\n\n\"Yes, Moreland, in coming out of the hotel, evidently saw Frettlby, and\nthreatened to expose him unless he paid for his silence.\"\n\n\"Very strange,\" murmured Kilsip, to himself, with a disappointed look\non his face. \"But why did Moreland keep still so long?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you,\" replied Calton, \"but, no doubt, the confession\nwill explain all.\"\n\n\"Then for Heaven's sake read it,\" broke in Dr. Chinston, impatiently.\n\"I'm quite in the dark, and all your talk is Greek to me.\"\n\n\"One moment,\" said Kilsip, dragging a bundle from under his chair, and\nuntying it. \"If you are right, what about this?\" and he held up a light\ncoat, very much soiled and weather-worn.\n\n\"Whose is that?\" asked Calton, startled. \"Not Whyte's?\"\n\n\"Yes, Whyte's,\" repeated Kilsip, with great satisfaction. \"I found it\nin the Fitzroy Gardens, near the gate that opens to George Street, East\nMelbourne. It was up in a fir-tree.\"\n\n\"Then Mr. Frettlby must have got out at Powlett Street, and walked down\nGeorge Street, and then through the Fitzroy Gardens into town,\" said\nCalton.\n\nKilsip took no heed of the remark, but took a small bottle out of the\npocket of the coat and held it up.\n\n\"I also found this,\" he said.\n\n\"Chloroform,\" cried everyone, guessing at once that it was the missing\nbottle.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Kilsip, replacing it. \"This was the bottle which\ncontained the poison used by--by--well, call him the murderer. The name\nof the chemist being on the label, I went to him and found out who\nbought it. Now, who do you think?\" with a look of triumph.\n\n\"Frettlby,\" said Calton, decidedly.\n\n\"No, Moreland,\" burst out Chinston, greatly excited.\n\n\"Neither,\" retorted the detective, calmly. \"The man who purchased this\nwas Oliver Whyte himself.\"\n\n\"Himself?\" echoed Brian, now thoroughly surprised, as, indeed were all\nthe others.\n\n\"Yes. I had no trouble in finding out that, thanks to the 'Poisons\nAct.' As I knew no one would be so foolish as to carry chloroform about\nin his pocket for any length of time, I mentioned the day of the murder\nas the probable date it was bought. The chemist turned up in his book,\nand found that Whyte was the purchaser.\"\n\n\"And what did he buy it for?\" asked Chinston.\n\n\"That's more than I can tell you,\" said Kilsip, with a shrug of his\nshoulders. \"It's down in the book as being bought for medicinal uses,\nwhich may mean anything.\"\n\n\"The law requires a witness,\" observed Calton, cautiously. \"Who was the\nwitness?\"\n\nAgain Kilsip smiled triumphantly.\n\n\"I think I can guess,\" said Fitzgerald. \"Moreland?\"\n\nKilsip nodded.\n\n\"And I suppose,\" remarked Calton, in a slightly sarcastic tone, \"that\nis another of your proofs against Moreland. He knew that Whyte had\nchloroform on him, therefore he followed him that night and murdered\nhim?\"\n\n\"Well, I--\"\n\n\"It's a lot of nonsense,\" said the barrister, impatiently. \"There's\nnothing against Moreland to implicate him. If he killed Whyte, what\nmade him go and see Frettlby?\"\n\n\"But,\" said Kilsip, sagely nodding his head, \"if, as Moreland says, he\nhad Whyte's coat in his possession before the murder how is it that I\nshould discover it afterwards up a fir-tree in the Fitzroy Gardens,\nwith an empty chloroform bottle in the pocket.\"\n\n\"He may have been an accomplice,\" suggested Calton.\n\n\"What's the good of all this conjecturing?\" said Chinston, impatiently,\nnow thoroughly tired of the discussion. \"Read the confession, and we\nwill soon know the truth, without all this talk.\"\n\nCalton assented, and all having settled themselves to listen, he began\nto read what the dead man had written.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nTHE CONFESSION.\n\n\n\"What I am now about to write is set forth by me so that the true\ncircumstances connected with the 'Hansom Cab Tragedy,' which took place\nin Melbourne in 18--, may be known. I owe a confession, particularly to\nBrian Fitzgerald, seeing that he was accused of the crime. Although I\nknow he was rightfully acquitted of the charge, yet I wish him to know\nall about the case, though I am convinced, from his altered demeanour\ntowards me, that he is better acquainted with it than he chooses to\nconfess. In order to account for the murder of Oliver Whyte, I must go\nback to the beginning of my life in this colony, and show how the\nseries of events began which culminated in the committal of the crime.\n\n\"Should it be necessary to make this confession public, in the\ninterests of justice, I can say nothing against such a course being\ntaken; but I would be grateful if it could be suppressed, both on\naccount of my good name and of my dear daughter Margaret, whose love\nand affection has so soothed and brightened my life.\n\n\"If, however, she should be informed of the contents of these pages, I\nask her to deal leniently with the memory of one who was sorely tried\nand tempted.\n\n\"I came to the colony of Victoria, or, rather, as it was called then,\nNew South Wales, in the year 18--. I had been in a merchant's office in\nLondon, but not finding much opportunity for advancement, I looked\nabout to see if I could better myself. I heard of this new land across\nthe ocean, and though it was not then the El Dorado which it afterwards\nturned out, and, truth to tell, had rather a shady name, owing to the\ntransportation of convicts, yet I longed to go there and start a new\nlife. Unhappily, however, I had not the means, and saw nothing better\nbefore me than the dreary life of a London clerk, as it was impossible\nthat I could save out of the small salary I got. Just at this time, an\nold maiden aunt of my mother's died and left a few hundred pounds to\nme. With this, I came out to Australia, determined to become a rich\nman. I stayed some time in Sydney, and then came over to Port Phillip,\nnow so widely known as Marvellous Melbourne, where I intended to pitch\nmy tent. I saw that it was a young and rising colony, though, of\ncourse, coming as I did, before the days of the gold diggings, I never\ndreamt it would spring up, as it has done since, into a nation. I was\ncareful and saving in those days, and, indeed, I think it was the\nhappiest time of my life.\n\n\"I bought land whenever I could scrape the money together, and, at the\ntime of the gold rush, was considered well-to-do. When, however, the\ncry that gold had been discovered was raised, and the eyes of all the\nnations were turned to Australia, with her glittering treasures, men\npoured in from all parts of the world, and the 'Golden Age' commenced.\nI began to grow rich rapidly, and was soon pointed out as the\nwealthiest man in the Colonies. I bought a station, and, leaving the\nriotous, feverish Melbourne life, went to live on it. I enjoyed myself\nthere, for the wild, open-air life had great charms for me, and there\nwas a sense of freedom to which I had hitherto been a stranger. But man\nis a gregarious animal, and I, growing weary of solitude and communings\nwith Mother Nature, came down on a visit to Melbourne, where, with\ncompanions as gay as myself, I spent my money freely, and, as the\nphrase goes, saw life. After confessing that I loved the pure life of\nthe country, it sounds strange to say I enjoyed the wild life of the\ntown, but I did. I was neither a Joseph nor a St. Anthony, and I was\ndelighted with Bohemia, with its good fellowship and charming suppers,\nwhich took place in the small hours of the morning, when wit and humour\nreigned supreme. It was at one of these suppers that I first met\nRosanna Moore, the woman who was destined to curse my existence. She\nwas a burlesque actress, and all the young fellows in those days were\nmadly in love with her. She was not exactly what was called beautiful,\nbut there was a brilliancy and fascination about her which few could\nresist. On first seeing her I did not admire her much, but laughed at\nmy companions as they raved about her. On becoming personally\nacquainted with her, however, I found that her powers of fascination\nhad not been over-rated, and I ended by falling desperately in love\nwith her. I made enquiries about her private life, and found that it\nwas irreproachable, as she was guarded by a veritable dragon of a\nmother, who would let no one approach her daughter. I need not tell\nabout my courtship, as these phases of a man's life are generally the\nsame, but it will be sufficient to prove the depth of my passion for\nher when I say that I determined to make her my wife. It was on\ncondition, however, that the marriage should be kept secret until such\ntime as I should choose to reveal it. My reason for such a course was\nthis, my father was still alive, and he, being a rigid Presbyterian,\nwould never have forgiven me for having married a woman of the stage;\nso, as he was old and feeble, I did not wish him to learn that I had\ndone so, fearing that the shock would be too much for him in his then\nstate of health. I told Rosanna I would marry her, but wanted her to\nleave her mother, who was a perfect fury, and not an agreeable person\nto live with. As I was rich, young, and not bad looking, Rosanna\nconsented, and, during an engagement she had in Sydney, I went over\nthere and married her. She never told her mother she had married me,\nwhy, I do not know, as I laid no restriction on her doing so. The\nmother made a great noise over the matter, but I gave Rosanna a large\nsum of money for her, and this the old harridan accepted, and left for\nNew Zealand. Rosanna went with me to my station, where we lived as man\nand wife, though, in Melbourne, she was supposed to be my mistress. At\nlast, feeling degraded in my own eyes at the way in which I was\nsupposed to be living, I wanted to reveal our secret, but this Rosanna\nwould not consent to. I was astonished at this, and could never\ndiscover the reason, but in many ways Rosanna was an enigma to me. She\nthen grew weary of the quiet country life, and longed to return to the\nglitter and glare of the footlights. This I refused to let her do, and\nfrom that moment she took a dislike to me. A child was born, and for a\ntime she was engrossed with it, but soon wearied of the new plaything,\nand again pressed me to allow her to return to the stage. I again\nrefused, and we became estranged from one another. I grew gloomy and\nirritable, and was accustomed to take long rides by myself, frequently\nbeing away for days. There was a great friend of mine who owned the\nnext station, a fine, handsome young fellow, called Frank Kelly, with a\ngay, sunny disposition, and a wonderful flow of humour. When he found I\nwas so much away, thinking Rosanna was only my mistress, he began to\nconsole her, and succeeded so well that one day, on my return from a\nride, I found she had fled with him, and had taken the child with her.\nShe left a letter saying that she had never really cared for me, but\nhad married me for my money--she would keep our marriage secret, and\nwas going to return to the stage. I followed my false friend and false\nwife down to Melbourne, but arrived too late, as they had just left for\nEngland. Disgusted with the manner in which I had been treated, I\nplunged into a whirl of dissipation, trying to drown the memory of my\nmarried life. My friends, of course, thought that my loss amounted to\nno more than that of a mistress, and I soon began myself to doubt that\nI had ever been married, so far away and visionary did my life of the\nprevious year seem. I continued my fast life for about six months, when\nsuddenly I was arrested upon the brink of destruction by--an angel. I\nsay this advisedly, for if ever there was an angel upon earth, it was\nshe who afterwards became my wife. She was the daughter of a doctor,\nand it was her influence which drew me back from the dreary path of\nprofligacy and dissipation which I was then leading. I paid her great\nattention, and we were, in fact, looked upon as good as engaged; but I\nknew that I was still linked to that accursed woman, and could not ask\nher to be my wife. At this second crisis of my life Fate again\nintervened, for I received a letter from England, which informed me\nthat Rosanna Moore had been run over in the streets of London, and had\ndied in an hospital. The writer was a young doctor who had attended\nher, and I wrote home to him, begging him to send out a certificate of\nher death, so that I might be sure she was no more. He did so, and also\nenclosed an account of the accident, which had appeared in a newspaper.\nThen, indeed, I felt that I was free, and closing, as I thought, for\never the darkest page of my life's history, I began to look forward to\nthe future. I married again, and my domestic life was a singularly\nhappy one. As the colony grew greater, with every year I became even\nmore wealthy than I had been, and was looked up to and respected by my\nfellow-citizens. When my dear daughter Margaret was born, I felt that\nmy cup of happiness was full, but suddenly I received a disagreeable\nreminder of the past. Rosanna's mother made her appearance one day--a\ndisreputable-looking creature, smelling of gin, in whom I could not\nrecognise the respectably-dressed woman who used to accompany Rosanna\nto the theatre. She had spent long ago all the money I had given her,\nand had sank lower and lower, until she now lived in a slum off Little\nBourke Street. I made enquiries after the child, and she told me it was\ndead. Rosanna had not taken it to England with her, but had left it in\nher mother's charge, and, no doubt, neglect and want of proper\nnourishment was the cause of its death. There now seemed to be no link\nto bind me to the past with the exception of the old hag, who knew\nnothing about the marriage. I did not attempt to undeceive her, but\nagreed to allow her enough to live on if she promised never to trouble\nme again, and to keep quiet about everything which had reference to my\nconnection with her daughter. She promised readily enough, and went\nback to her squalid dwelling in the slums, where, for all I know, she\nstill lives, as money has been paid to her regularly every month by my\nsolicitors. I heard nothing more about the matter, and now felt quite\nsatisfied that I had heard the last of Rosanna. As years rolled on,\nthings prospered with me, and so fortunate was I in all speculations\nthat my luck became proverbial. Then, alas! when all things seemed to\nsmile upon me, my wife died, and the world has never seemed the same to\nme since. But I had my dear daughter to console me, and in her love and\naffection I became reconciled to the loss of my wife. A young Irish\ngentleman, called Brian Fitzgerald, came out to Australia, and I soon\nsaw that my daughter was in love with him, and that he reciprocated\nthat affection, whereat I was glad, as I have always esteemed him\nhighly. I looked forward to their marriage, when suddenly a series of\nevents occurred, which must be fresh in the memory of those who read\nthese pages. Mr. Oliver Whyte, a gentleman from London, called on me\nand startled me with the news that my first wife, Rosanna Moore, was\nstill living, and that the story of her death had been an ingenious\nfabrication in order to deceive me. She had met with an accident, as\nstated in the newspaper, and had been taken to an hospital, where she\nrecovered. The young doctor, who had sent me the certificate of her\ndeath, had fallen in love with her, and wanted to marry her, and had\ntold me that she was dead in order that her past life might be\nobliterated. The doctor, however, died before the marriage, and Rosanna\ndid not trouble herself about undeceiving me. She was then acting on\nthe burlesque stage under the name of 'Musette,' and seemed to have\ngained an unenviable notoriety by her extravagance and infamy. Whyte\nmet her in London, and she became his mistress. He seemed to have had a\nwonderful influence over her, for she told him all her past life, and\nabout her marriage with me. Her popularity being on the wane in London,\nas she was now growing old, and had to make way for younger actresses,\nWhyte proposed that they should proceed to the colonies and extort\nmoney from me, and he had come to me for that purpose. The villain told\nme all this in the coolest manner, and I, knowing he held the secret of\nmy life, was unable to resent it. I refused to see Rosanna, but told\nWhyte I would agree to his terms, which were, first, a large sum of\nmoney was to be paid to Rosanna, and, secondly, that he should marry my\ndaughter. I, at first, absolutely declined to sanction the latter\nproposal, but as he threatened to publish the story, and that meant the\nproclamation to the world of my daughter's illegitimacy, I at\nlast--agreed, and he began to pay his addresses to Madge. She, however,\nrefused to marry him, and told me she was engaged to Fitzgerald, so,\nafter a severe struggle with myself, I told Whyte that I would not\nallow him to marry Madge, but would give him whatever sum he liked to\nname. On the night he was murdered he came to see me, and showed me the\ncertificate of marriage between myself and Rosanna Moore. He refused to\ntake a sum of money, and said that unless I consented to his marriage\nwith Madge he would publish the whole affair. I implored him to give me\ntime to think, so he said he would give me two days, but no more, and\nleft the house, taking the marriage certificate with him. I was in\ndespair, and saw that the only way to save myself was to obtain\npossession of the marriage certificate and deny everything. With this\nidea in my mind I followed him up to town and saw him meet Moreland,\nand drink with him. They went into the hotel in Russell Street, and\nwhen Whyte came out, at half-past twelve, he was quite intoxicated. I\nsaw him go along to the Scotch Church, near the Bourke and Wills'\nmonument, and cling to the lamp-post at the corner. I thought I would\nthen be able to get the certificate from him, as he was so drunk, when\nI saw a gentleman in a light coat--I did not know it was\nFitzgerald--come up to him and hail a cab for him. I saw there was\nnothing more to be done at that time, so, in despair, went home and\nwaited for the next day, in fear lest he should carry out his\ndetermination. Nothing, however, turned up, and I was beginning to\nthink that Whyte had abandoned his purpose, when I heard that he had\nbeen murdered in the hansom cab. I was in great fear lest the marriage\ncertificate should be found on him, but nothing was said about it. This\nI could not understand at all. I knew he had it on him, and I could\nonly conclude that the murderer, whoever he was, had taken it from the\nbody, and would sooner or later come to me to extort money, knowing\nthat I dare not denounce him. Fitzgerald was arrested, and afterwards\nacquitted, so I began to think that the certificate had been lost, and\nmy troubles were at an end. However, I was always haunted by a dread\nthat the sword was hanging over my head, and would fall sooner or\nlater. I was right, for two nights ago Roger Moreland, who was an\nintimate friend of Whyte's, called on me, and produced the marriage\ncertificate, which he offered to sell to me for five thousand pounds.\nIn horror, I accused him of murdering Whyte, which he denied at first,\nbut afterwards acknowledged, stating that I dare not betray him for my\nown sake. I was nearly mad with the horror I was placed in, either to\ndenounce my daughter as illegitimate or let a murderer escape the\npenalty of his crime. At last I agreed to keep silent, and handed him a\ncheque for five thousand pounds, receiving in return the marriage\ncertificate. I then made Moreland swear to leave the colony, which he\nreadily agreed to do, saying Melbourne was dangerous. When he left I\nreflected upon the awfulness of my position, and I had almost\ndetermined to commit suicide, but, thank God, I was saved from that\ncrime. I write this confession in order that after my death the true\nstory of the murder of Whyte may be known, and that any one who may\nhereafter be accused of the murder may not be wrongfully punished. I\nhave no hopes of Moreland ever receiving the penalty of his crime, as\nwhen this is opened all trace of him will, no doubt, be lost. I will\nnot destroy the marriage certificate, but place it with these papers,\nso that the truth of my story can be seen. In conclusion, I would ask\nforgiveness of my daughter Margaret for my sins, which have been\nvisited on her, but she can see for herself that circumstances were too\nstrong for me. May she forgive me, as I hope God in His infinite mercy\nwill, and may she come sometimes and pray over my grave, nor think too\nhardly upon her dead father.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\nTHE HANDS OF JUSTICE.\n\n\nCalton's voice faltered a little when he read those last sad words, and\nhe laid the manuscript down on the table, amid a dead silence, which\nwas first broken by Brian.\n\n\"Thank God,\" he said, reverently, \"thank God that he was innocent of\nthe crime!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Calton, a little cynically, \"the riddle which has perplexed\nus so long is read, and the Sphinx is silent for evermore.\"\n\n\"I knew he was incapable of such a thing,\" cried Chinston, whom emotion\nhad hitherto kept silent.\n\nMeanwhile Kilsip listened to these eulogistic remarks on the dead man,\nand purred to himself, in a satisfied sort of way, like a cat who has\ncaught a mouse.\n\n\"You see, sir,\" he said, addressing the barrister, \"I was right after\nall.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Calton, frankly, \"I acknowledge my defeat, but now--\"\n\n\"I'm going to arrest Moreland right off,\" said Kilsip.\n\nThere was a silence for a few moments, and then Calton spoke again.\n\n\"I suppose it must be so--poor girl--poor girl.\"\n\n\"I'm very sorry for the young lady myself,\" said the detective in his\nsoft, low voice; \"but you see I cannot let a dangerous criminal escape\nfor a mere matter of sentiment.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Fitzgerald, sharply. \"Moreland must be arrested\nright off.\"\n\n\"But he will confess everything,\" said Calton, angrily, \"and then\neveryone will know about this first marriage.\"\n\n\"Let them,\" retorted Brian, bitterly. \"As soon as she is well enough we\nwill marry at once, and leave Australia for ever.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"I know her better than you do,\" said the young man, doggedly; \"and I\nknow she would like an end made of this whole miserable business at\nonce. Arrest the murderer, and let him suffer for his crime.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose it must be so,\" said Chinston, with a sigh, \"but it\nseems very hard that this slur should be cast upon Miss Frettlby.\"\n\nBrian turned a little pale.\n\n\"The sins of the father are generally visited upon the children by the\nworld,\" he said bitterly. \"But after the first pain is over, in new\nlands among new faces, she will forget the bitter past.\"\n\n\"Now that it is settled Moreland is to be arrested,\" said Calton, \"how\nis it to be done? Is he still in Melbourne?\"\n\n\"Rather,\" said Kilsip in a satisfied tone; \"I've had my eye on him for\nthe last two months, and someone is watching him for me now--trust me,\nhe can't move two steps without my knowing it.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed!\" said Calton, quickly. \"Then do you know if he has been to\nthe bank and cashed that cheque for five thousand, which Frettlby gave\nhim?\"\n\n\"Well, now,\" observed Kilsip, after a pause, \"do you know you rather\nstartled me when you told me he had received a cheque for that amount.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"It's such a large one,\" replied the detective, \"and had I known what\nsum he had paid into his account I should have been suspicious.\"\n\n\"Then he has been to the bank?\"\n\n\"To his own bank, yes. He went there yesterday afternoon at two\no'clock--that is the day after he got it--so it would be sent round to\nMr. Frettlby's bank, and would not be returned till next day, and as he\ndied in the meanwhile I expect it hasn't been honoured, so Mr. Moreland\nwon't have his money yet.\"\n\n\"I wonder what he'll do,\" said Chinston.\n\n\"Go to the manager and kick up a row,\" said Kilsip, coolly, \"and the\nmanager will no doubt tell him he'd better see the executors.\"\n\n\"But, my good friend, the manager doesn't know who the executors are,\"\nbroke in Calton, impatiently. \"You forget the will has yet to be read.\"\n\n\"Then he'll tell him to go to the late Mr. Frettlby's solicitors. I\nsuppose he knows who they are,\" retorted Kilsip.\n\n\"Thinton and Tarbit,\" said Calton, musingly; \"but it's questionable if\nMoreland would go to them.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't he, sir?\" said Kilsip, quickly. \"He does not know\nanything about this,\" laying his hand on the confession, \"and as the\ncheque is genuine enough he won't let five thousand pounds go without a\nstruggle.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what,\" observed Calton, after a few moments of\nreflection, \"I'll go across the way and telephone to Thinton and\nTarbit, and when he calls on them they can send him up to me.\"\n\n\"A very good idea,\" said Kilsip, rubbing his hands, \"and then I can\narrest him.\"\n\n\"But the warrant?\" interposed Brian, as Calton rose and put on his hat.\n\n\"Is here,\" said the detective, producing it.\n\n\"By Jove, you must have been pretty certain of his guilt,\" remarked\nChinston, dryly.\n\n\"Of course I was,\" retorted Kilsip, in a satisfied tone of voice. \"When\nI told the magistrate where I found the coat, and reminded him of\nMoreland's acknowledgment at the trial, that he had it in his\npossession before the murder, I soon got him to see the necessity of\nhaving Moreland arrested.\"\n\n\"Half-past four,\" said Calton, pausing for a moment at the door and\nlooking at his watch. \"I'm afraid it's rather late to catch Moreland\nto-day; however, I'll see what Thinton and Tarbit know,\" and he went\nout.\n\nThe rest sat waiting his return, and chatted about the curious end of\nthe hansom cab mystery, when, in about ten minutes, Calton rushed in\nhurriedly and closed the door after him quickly.\n\n\"Fate is playing into our hands,\" he said, as soon as he recovered his\nbreath. \"Moreland called on Thinton and Tarbit, as Kilsip surmised, and\nas neither of them was in, he said he would call again before five\no'clock. I told the clerk to bring him up to me at once, so he may be\nhere at any moment.\"\n\n\"That is, if he's fool enough to come,\" observed Chinston.\n\n\"Oh, he'll come,\" said the detective, confidently, rattling a pair of\nhandcuffs together. \"He is so satisfied that he has made things safe\nthat he'll walk right into the trap.\"\n\nIt was getting a little dusk, and the four men were greatly excited,\nthough they concealed it under an assumed nonchalance.\n\n\"What a situation for a drama,\" said Brian.\n\n\"Only,\" said Chinston, quietly, \"it is as realistic as in the old days\nof the Coliseum, where the actor who played Orpheus was torn to pieces\nby bears at the end of the play.\"\n\n\"His last appearance on any stage, I suppose,\" said Calton, a little\ncruelly, it must be confessed.\n\nMeanwhile, Kilsip remained seated in his chair, humming an operatic air\nand chinking the handcuffs together, by way of accompaniment. He felt\nintensely pleased with himself, the more so, as he saw that by this\ncapture he would be ranked far above Gorby. \"And what would Gorby\nsay?--Gorby, who had laughed at all his ideas as foolish, and who had\nbeen quite wrong from the first. If only--\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Calton, holding up his finger, as steps were heard echoing\non the flags outside. \"Here he is, I believe.\"\n\nKilsip arose from his chair, and, stealing softly to the window, looked\ncautiously out. Then he turned round to those inside and, nodding his\nhead, slipped the handcuffs into his pocket. Just as he did so, there\nwas a knock at the door, and, in response to Calton's invitation to\nenter, Thinton and Tarbit's clerk came in with Roger Moreland. The\nlatter faltered a little on the threshold, when he saw Calton was not\nalone, and seemed half inclined to retreat. But, evidently, thinking\nthere was no danger of his secret being discovered, he pulled himself\ntogether, and advanced into the room in an easy and confident manner.\n\n\"This is the gentleman who wants to know about the cheque, sir,\" said\nThinton and Tarbit's clerk to Calton.\n\n\"Oh, indeed,\" answered Calton, quietly. \"I am glad to see him; you can\ngo.\"\n\nThe clerk bowed and went out, closing the door after him. Moreland took\nhis seat directly in front of Calton, and with his back to the door.\nKilsip, seeing this, strolled across the room in a nonchalant manner,\nwhile Calton engaged Moreland in conversation, and quietly turned the\nkey.\n\n\"You want to see me, sir?\" said Calton, resuming his seat.\n\n\"Yes; that is alone,\" replied Moreland, uneasily.\n\n\"Oh, these gentlemen are my friends,\" said Calton, quietly; \"anything\nyou may say is quite safe.\"\n\n\"That they are your friends, and are quite safe, is nothing to me,\"\nsaid Moreland, insolently, \"I wish to speak to you in private.\"\n\n\"Don't you think you would like to know my friends?\" said Calton,\ncoolly taking no notice of his remark.\n\n\"D-- your friends, sir!\" cried Moreland, furiously, rising from his seat.\n\nCalton laughed, and introduced Mr. Moreland to the others.\n\n\"Dr. Chinston, Mr. Kilsip, and--Mr. Fitzgerald.\"\n\n\"Fitzgerald,\" gasped Moreland, growing pale. \"I--I--what's that?\" he\nshrieked, as he saw Whyte's coat, all weather-stained, lying on a chair\nnear him, and which he immediately recognised.\n\n\"That is the rope that's going to hang you,\" said Kilsip, quietly,\ncoming behind him, \"for the murder of Oliver Whyte.\"\n\n\"Trapped by G--!\" shouted the wretched man, wheeling round, so as to\nface Kilsip. He sprang at the detective's throat, and they both rolled\ntogether on the floor, but the latter was too strong for him, and,\nafter a sharp struggle, he succeeded in getting the handcuffs on\nMoreland's wrists. The others stood around perfectly quiet, knowing\nthat Kilsip required no assistance. Now that there was no possibility\nof escape, Moreland seemed to become resigned, and rose sullenly off\nthe floor.\n\n\"I'll make you pay for this,\" he hissed between hie teeth, with a white\ndespairing face. \"You can't prove anything.\"\n\n\"Can't we?\" said Calton, touching the confession. \"You are wrong. This\nis the confession of Mark Frettlby made before he died.\"\n\n\"It's a lie.\"\n\n\"A jury will decide that,\" said the barrister, dryly. \"Meanwhile you\nwill pass the night in the Melbourne Gaol.\"\n\n\"Ah! perhaps they'll give me the same cell as you occupied,\" said\nMoreland, with a hard laugh, turning to Fitzgerald. \"I should like it\nfor its old associations.\"\n\nBrian did not answer him, but picking up his hat and gloves, prepared\nto go.\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Moreland, fiercely. \"I see that it's all up with me, so\nI'm not going to lie like a coward. I've played for a big stake and\nlost, but if I hadn't been such a fool I'd have cashed that cheque the\nnext morning, and been far away by this time.\"\n\n\"It certainly would have been wiser,\" said Calton.\n\n\"After all,\" said Moreland, nonchalantly, taking no notice of his\nremark, \"I don't know that I'm sorry about it. I've had a hell upon\nearth since I killed Whyte.\"\n\n\"Then you acknowledge your guilt?\" said Brian, quietly.\n\nMoreland shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I told you I wasn't a coward,\" he answered, coolly. \"Yes, I did it; it\nwas Whyte's own fault. When I met him that night he told me how\nFrettlby wouldn't let him marry his daughter, but said he'd make him,\nand showed me the marriage certificate. I thought if I could only get\nit I'd make a nice little pile out of Frettlby over it; so when Whyte\nwent on drinking I did not. After he had gone out of the hotel, I put\non his coat, which he left behind. I saw him standing near the\nlamp-post, and Fitzgerald come up and then leave him. When you came\ndown the street,\" he went on, turning to Fitzgerald, \"I shrank back\ninto the shadow, and when you passed I ran up to Whyte as the cabman\nwas putting him into the hansom. He took me for you, so I didn't\nundeceive him, but I swear I had no idea of murdering Whyte when I got\ninto the cab. I tried to get the papers, but he wouldn't let me, and\ncommenced to sing out. Then I thought of the chloroform in the pocket\nof his coat, which I was wearing. I pulled it out, and found that the\ncork was loose. Then I took out Whyte's handkerchief, which was also in\nthe coat, and emptied the bottle on it, and put it back in my pocket. I\nagain tried to get the papers, without using the chloroform, but\ncouldn't, so I clapped the handkerchief over his mouth, and he went off\nafter a few minutes, and I got the papers. I thought he was only\ninsensible, and it was only when I saw the newspapers that I knew he\nwas dead. I stopped the cab in St. Kilda Road, got out and caught\nanother cab, which was going to town. Then I got out at Powlett Street,\ntook off the coat, and carried it over my arm. I went down George\nStreet, towards the Fitzroy Gardens, and having hid the coat up a tree,\nwhere I suppose you found it,\" to Kilsip, \"I walked home--so I've done\nyou all nicely, but--\"\n\n\"You're caught at last,\" finished Kilsip, quietly.\n\nMoreland fell down in a chair, with an air of utter weariness and\nlassitude.\n\n\"No man can be stronger than Destiny,\" he said, dreamily. \"I have lost\nand you have won; so life is a chess board, after all, and we are the\npuppets of Fate.\"\n\nHe refused to utter another word; so leaving Calton and Kilsip with\nhim, Brian and the doctor went out and hailed a cab. It drove up to the\nentrance of the court, where Calton's office was, and then Moreland,\nwalking as if in a dream, left the room, and got into the cab, followed\nby Kilsip.\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Chinston, thoughtfully, as they stood and watched\nthe cab drive off, \"do you know what the end of that man will be?\"\n\n\"It requires no prophet to foretell that,\" said Calton, dryly. \"He will\nbe hanged.\"\n\n\"No, he won't,\" retorted the doctor. \"He will commit suicide.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\n\"THE LOVE THAT LIVES.\"\n\n\nThere are certain periods in the life of man when Fate seems to have\ndone her worst, and any further misfortunes which may befall are\naccepted with a philosophical resignation, begotten by the very\nseverity of previous trials. Fitzgerald was in this state of mind--he\nwas calm, but it was the calmness of despair--the misfortunes of the\npast year seemed to have come to a climax, and he looked forward to the\npublication of the whole bitter story with an indifference that\nsurprised himself. His own name, and that of Madge and her dead father,\nwould be on every tongue, yet he felt perfectly callous to whatever\nmight be said on the subject. So long as Madge recovered, and they\ncould go away to another part of the world, leaving Australia, with its\nbitter memories behind--he did not care. Moreland would suffer the\nbitter penalty of his crime, and then nothing more would ever be heard\nof the matter. It would be better for the whole story to be told, and\ntransitory pain endured, than to go on striving to hide the infamy and\nshame which might be discovered at any moment. Already the news was all\nover Melbourne that the murderer of Oliver Whyte had been captured, and\nthat his confession would bring to light certain startling facts\nconcerning the late Mark Frettlby. Brian well knew that the world\nwinked at secret vices so long as there was an attempt at concealment,\nthough it was cruelly severe on those which were brought to light, and\nthat many whose lives might be secretly far more culpable than poor\nMark Frettlby's, would be the first to slander the dead man. The public\ncuriosity, however, was destined never to be gratified, for the next\nday it was known that Roger Moreland had hanged himself in his cell\nduring the night, and had left no confession behind him.\n\nWhen Brian heard this, he breathed a heartfelt prayer of thanks for his\ndeliverance, and went to see Calton, whom he found at his chambers, in\ndeep conversation with Chinston and Kilsip. They all came to the\nconclusion that as Moreland was now dead, nothing could be gained by\npublishing the confession of Mark Frettlby, so agreed to burn it, and\nwhen Fitzgerald saw in the heap of blackened paper in the fireplace all\nthat remained of the bitter story, he felt a weight lifted off his\nheart. The barrister, Chinston, and Kilsip, all promised to keep\nsilent, and they kept the promise nobly, for nothing was ever known of\nthe circumstances which led to the death of Oliver Whyte, and it was\ngenerally supposed that it must have been caused by some quarrel\nbetween the dead man and his friend Roger Moreland.\n\nFitzgerald, however, did not forget the good service that Kilsip had\ndone him, and gave him a sum of money which made him independent for\nlife, though he still followed his old profession of a detective from\nsheer love of excitement, and was always looked upon with admiration as\nthe man who had solved the mystery of the famous hansom cab murder.\nBrian, after several consultations with Calton, at last came to the\nconclusion that it would be useless to reveal to Sal Rawlins the fact\nthat she was Mark Frettlby's daughter, as by the will the money was\nclearly left to Madge, and such a revelation could bring her no\npecuniary benefit, while her bringing up unfitted her for the position;\nso a yearly income, more than sufficient for her wants, was settled\nupon her, and she was allowed to remain in ignorance of her parentage.\nThe influence of Sal Rawlins' old life, however, was very strong on\nher, and she devoted herself to the task of saving her fallen sisters.\nKnowing as she did, all the intricacies of the slums, she was enabled\nto do an immense amount of good, and many an unhappy woman was saved\nfrom the squalor and hardship of a gutter life by the kind hand of Sal\nRawlins.\n\nFelix Rolleston became a member of Parliament, where his speeches, if\nnot very deep, were at least amusing; and while in the House he always\nbehaved like a gentleman, which could not be said of all his\nParliamentary colleagues.\n\nMadge slowly recovered from her illness, and as she had been explicitly\nnamed in the will as heiress to Mark Frettlby's great wealth, she\nplaced the management of her estates in the hands of Mr. Calton, who,\nwith Thinton and Tarbit, acted as her agents in Australia. On her\nrecovery she learned the story of her father's early marriage, but both\nCalton and Fitzgerald were silent about the fact of Sal Rawlins being\nher half-sister, as such a relation could do no good, and would only\ncreate a scandal, as no explanation could be given except the true one.\nShortly afterwards Madge married Fitzgerald, and both of them only too\ngladly left Australia, with all its sorrows and bitter memories.\n\nStanding with her husband on the deck of one of the P. and O. steamers,\nas it ploughed the blue waters of Hobson's Bay into foam, they both\nwatched Melbourne gradually fade from their view, under the glow of the\nsunset. They could see the two great domes of the Exhibition, and the\nLaw Courts, and also Government House, with its tall tower rising from\nthe midst of the green trees. In the background was a bright crimson\nsky, barred with masses of black clouds, and over all the great city\nhung a cloud of smoke like a pall. The flaring red light of the sinking\nsun glared angrily on the heavy waters, and the steamer seemed to be\nmaking its way through a sea of blood. Madge, clinging to her husband's\narm, felt her eyes fill with tears, as she saw the land of her birth\nreceding slowly.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" she murmured, softly. \"Good-bye for ever.\"\n\n\"You do not regret?\" he said, bending his head.\n\n\"Regret, no,\" she answered, looking at him with loving eyes.\n\n\"With you by my side, I fear nothing. Surely our hearts have been tried\nin the furnace of affliction, and our love has been chastened and\npurified.\"\n\n\"We are sure of nothing in this world,\" replied Brian, with a sigh.\n\"But after all the sorrow and grief of the past, let us hope that the\nfuture will be peace.\"\n\n\"Peace!\"\n\nA white-winged sea-gull rose suddenly from the crimson waters, and\ncircled rapidly in the air above them.\n\n\"A happy omen,\" she said, looking up fondly to the grave face of her\nhusband, \"for your life and for mine.\"\n\nHe bent down and kissed her.\n\nThe great steamer moved slowly out to sea, and as they stood on the\ndeck, hand clasped in hand, with the fresh salt breeze blowing keenly\nin their faces, it bore them away into the placid beauty of the coming\nnight, towards the old world and the new life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Mystery of a Hansom Cab, by Fergus Hume\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MYSTERY OF A HANSOM CAB ***\n\n***** This file should be named 4223.txt or 4223.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/4\/2\/2\/4223\/\n\nProduced by Col Choat.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1257,"split":"test"}
