{"ori_id":"ce595386dbe3945cafbea2a44a805db1d3c0cbb6","title":"John Q.","context":"John Q.\n A woman is driving dangerously down a winding road, recklessly passing cars until she comes upon a slow moving Mack truck. As she goes to pass, her car is clipped by a truck going in the opposite direction, then slammed full-force by the Mack, killing her.\nMeanwhile, John Quincy Archibald and his wife Denise witness their young son Michael collapse at his baseball game and take Michael to the hospital. After a series of tests at the hospital, John is informed by Dr. Raymond Turner and Rebecca Payne, the hospital administrator, that his son has an enlarged heart and will need a heart transplant to live. The procedure is very expensive: $250,000 (at a minimum), with a down payment of $75,000 (30%) required to get Michael's name on the organ donor list. John tells them he is insured, but after looking through his policy, they tell him that because the company he works for dropped John from full-time to part-time, his health insurance has been changed, and the new policy does not cover the surgery, which leaves John and Denise to raise $75,000 on their own. The family tries to raise the money but are only able to come up with a third of the necessary payment. The hospital tires of waiting and releases Michael; Denise urges John to do something. Unwilling to let his child die, John walks into the hospital ER with a handgun, gathers eleven hostages, and sets demands: his son's name on the recipient list as soon as possible. The hostage negotiator, Lt. Frank Grimes, stands down to let John cool off.\nMeanwhile, John and the eleven hostages learn more about each other. They begin to understand John's situation and support him a little as he ensures each of them receive the treatment they came to the emergency room for. One of them, Miriam, is pregnant, and her husband Steve is hoping that their first child is healthy. A young hostage, Julie, has a broken arm, and she and her boyfriend Mitch claim that a car crash caused it. Due to holes in their story, John and another hostage, Lester, conclude the two are lying and that Mitch beat up Julie. After a while, John agrees to release some hostages to have his son's name added to the list an hour afterward. He releases Steve, Miriam, and a hostage named Rosa with her baby.\nThe Chicago Chief of Police, Gus Monroe, gives a SWAT unit permission to insert a sniper into the building via an air shaft. John is shot but ends up receiving only a minor wound, which is treated right away. After taking the shot, the sniper's leg falls through the ceiling tiles. Outraged, John pulls him out of the air shaft and beats him up. Using the bound SWAT policeman as a human shield, he steps outside to the sight of dozens of policemen pointing weapons at him and a large, supportive crowd. John demands that his son be brought to the emergency room. The police agree to his demand in exchange for the SWAT sniper.\nOnce his son arrives, John reveals to the hostages his intention to commit suicide so his heart can be used to save his son. He persuades Dr. Turner to perform the operation, and two of his hostages bear witness to a will stating his last request. John says his last goodbyes to Michael and enters the operating room. He loads a single bullet into the gun and pulls the trigger, but the safety is on. As he prepares to end his life a second time, his wife learns about an organ donor (which happens to be the female driver that was killed in the beginning of the movie) who has been flown to the hospital for organ recovery. She runs to the emergency room and stops John from shooting himself, and John allows the hostages to go free. Michael is given the life-saving operation and, after watching the procedure with Denise, John is taken into police custody. Afterwards the entire ordeal becomes subject to a national debate about the quality and accessibility of insurance and healthcare. Three months later at his trial, all of the witnesses speak on his behalf. He is later acquitted of charges of attempted murder and armed criminal action but is found guilty of kidnapping. It is never revealed what his sentence for the crime will be, but his lawyer is overheard and saying that no judge will give him \"more than three to five (years)\" and that she will try to get it reduced to two.\n<html>\n<head><title>John Q Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"John Q script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"John Q script, John Q movie script, John Q film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mancini's \"Ave Maria\" fills the screen as a white BMW speeds along the road.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">CREDITS ROLL\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN is behind the wheel. We never see her face. Hanging from the mirror is a rosary with a crucifix. Her porcelain hand turns up the volume and the music swells. A silver bracelet dangles from her wrist.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">A slow-moving semi obstructs her path. The woman leans out the window to see if the road is clear before moving into the oncoming lane. She steps on the gas. She's in the wrong lane and can't get over. There are headlights in the distance and the moan of an airhorn is heard.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Suddenly, the headlights are upon her. And airhorn blasts and she's trapped between two monstrous big rigs. She cuts the wheel hard, but too late. The oncoming truck clips her, sending her car end over end.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">SLO-MO\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The accident is violent and horrible. The BMW cartwheels along the highway in a grotesque ballet of destruction. The music crescendos and sparks fly as the car skids along the pavement on its roof. And as the BMW violently smashes headfirst into the embankment, the beautiful woman is slammed into the windshield like a crash-test dummy. \n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">EXT. MIDDLE AMERICAN TOWN - PRE-DAWN\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The indigo horizon shimmers with the first light of morning. Vapor spewing smokestacks dwarf brick and mortar homes.

His strong, handsome face is beginning to show wear and tear. From across the room, last night's news broadcast drones on the TV. The President is telling everybody how wonderful the country is doing.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">JOHN Q. watches impassively, the irony not lost on him. Suddenly, he hears a noise. Something's not right. He jumps out of bed, wearing only a pair of BVDs.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">WIFE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Honey, what is it?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">EXT.

John Q. just watches as the truck speeds away, dragging the car along the cement.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The neighbors now stand on their porches, staring. J.Q. turns to see his wife, DENISE, standing in the doorway. She's not a happy camper. \n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Their nine year old son, MIKE, appears at his mother's side, wiping the sleep from his eyes.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MIKE\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's going on?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT.

SMACK. The ball lands in the shortstop's glove.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mike wobbles, doubles over and falls face first into the dirt. The Dodger shortstop stands over Mike. He can't decide if he should tag him. Players, spectators look on dazed, shocked.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">ANGLE - BLEACHERS\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">PUSH IN ON J.Q.'s FACE, panicked.

Collapsed playing baseball.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. notices Maguire glancing worriedly at Klein.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">He was running.

As Mike inhales the hissing air, Klein turns Mike on his side, probes his lung and lower back areas.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">He's going to be alright, isn't he?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR.

Mother's a cashier in a supermarket.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. KLEIN\n<P ID=\"dia\">how's the family's insurance?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">She shakes her head - \"we've got a problem.\" Payne sees J.Q. and Denise enter and she is immediately on her feet.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Archibald. Rebecca Payne, hospital director. This is Doctor Turner, head of our cardiology department.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">How's our boy doing?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Please sit down.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">John and Denise sit, and the lights are dimmed. Dr. Turner approaches an illuminated display of X-rays. He uses a pointer to clarify.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n<P ID=\"dia\">This X-ray is that of a normal, nine year old heart. This one is your son's.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">John Q. and Denise stare nervously at the fleshy fist-sized organs on the translucent glass.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">There are septal defects here, here, and here, which have induced a myopathy resulting pulmonary edema, and malignant ventricular ectopy. As you can see, Mike's heart is approximately three times normal size.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">He points to Mike's heart, huge in comparison.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm sorry. I don't understand. Could you pout that in layman's terms?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n<P ID=\"dia\">Of course. Basically, there's not enough blood being pumped by the heart, so it backs up in the lungs. Sort of like a sponge getting wet. Mike's heart is trying, but I'm afraid it's working too hard.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">So what's he need? An operation?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Turner gathers himself, takes off his glasses.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm afraid we're considerably beyond the point of corrective surgery, Mr. and Mrs. Archibald. Your son's heart is useless. He is going to need a transplant.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The room goes silent.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DENISE\n<P ID=\"dia\">He's nine.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Wait a second. There are other options.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">What options?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n<P ID=\"dia\">To do nothing. Medicate him. Keep him as comfortable as possible. You need to start thinking about quality of life now.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DENISE\n<P ID=\"dia\">I don't understand. We were just with him. He seemed fine.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n<P ID=\"dia\">He's going to seem fine. But as his heart gets worse, he will become increasingly fatigued, need more and more sleep, until one day, he'll go to sleep and he won't wake up.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n<P ID=\"dia\">I know it's difficult, but you must face the fact that your son may not have much time left. You might want to make it a happy time. Say goodbye.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DENISE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh my God.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n<P ID=\"dia\">And transplantation is a high risk operation. You could lose your son on the table. You may not want to take that chance.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">What do you think, Dr. Turner?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n<P ID=\"dia\">This isn't my decision.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">I know that. I'm asking for your opinion. Without surgery, how long does he have?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n<P ID=\"dia\">Not long. Months. Weeks. Days.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">This is too much for Denise. She breaks into tears. John puts his arms around her, steadies her, gathers his thoughts.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">What would you do if it was your son?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Mr. Archibald...\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Not you. Him.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'd do the transplant. Absolutely.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. looks at Denise, who nods.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Okay. Let's do it.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n<P ID=\"dia\">The first step is to get Mike's name on an organ recipient list. Once he does, his chances are very good. Your son's an extremely rare type so there's less demand. With B-positive blood, Mike could go to the top of the list right away.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n<P ID=\"dia\">It's not that simple. There are other considerations before a prospective recipient is placed on the donor list, Mr. Archibald. The cost of transplant surgery is expensive. In most cases, prohibitively so.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">I've got major medical. Don't worry, I'm covered.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Actually, we've already checked with your carrier. There's no provision in your policy for a procedure of this magnitude.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">There must be some kind of mistake. My son is covered. I've got full medical. He's covered.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n<P ID=\"dia\">What about you, Mrs. Archibald? Do you have coverage?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DENISE\n<P ID=\"dia\">No. I've only been working at the market a short time. You need to be there two years before you get benefits.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Payne flips through the Archibald family file.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n<P ID=\"dia\">I see that you don't own your own home. No investments, stocks, bonds. And you have a little over one thousand in savings.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Did you hear what I said? I'm telling you, I'm insured.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n<P ID=\"dia\">That may very well be, but you'll have to check with your carrier on that. In the meantime, I'm afraid we're going to have to treat you as a cash account.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DENISE\n<P ID=\"dia\">How much does a transplant cost?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Transplant surgery, doctor fees, post operative treatment and immunosuppressant drugs, you're looking at two-hundred and fifty-thousand dollars minimum.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">What are you saying? If I don't come up with a quarter million dollars you're not going to treat my son?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n<P ID=\"dia\">We have treated him. We continue to treat him. Now I understand how upset you are, sir. But with other options available, we are not obligated to cover a procedure this costly. If you opt for replacement surgery, that's your choice. But the hospital maintains a very strict policy with respect to cash patients. We require a down payment before the patient's name can be placed on the receiver list.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DENISE\n<P ID=\"dia\">What kind of down payment?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Thirty percent. Seventy-five thousand.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. Seventy-five thousand dollars to put my kid's name on a list?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DENISE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Our son is upstairs dying and all you can talk about is money?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yes, it takes money to provide health service. It's expensive for you and for us. My job is to keep this program alive. For everyone. Now, I'm sorry, but we need you to guarantee payment before we can place your son's name on the list.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. HALLWAY - CARDIO-THORACIC DEPT. - DAY\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. and Denise move down the hallway towards the elevators.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. KLEIN (O.S.)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Mr. and Mrs. Archibald?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">They turn.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">You don't want to treat my kid? Fine. I'll take him over to County Memorial.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. KLEIN\n<P ID=\"dia\">Trust me. You don't want to do that.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">I don't, huh? Watch me. It's a county hospital. They have to treat him.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. KLEIN\n<P ID=\"dia\">No they don't. Transplantation is always considered an elective procedure. This hospital's politics are particularly infuriating, but you're in the right place. Believe me. You want Dr. Turner. His bedside manner is terrible, but he's one of the foremost surgeons in the country.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">What do you want us to do? You heard Payne. We're a cash account.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. KLEIN\n<P ID=\"dia\">I know it's outrageous, but don't give up. Talk to your insurance company. Check with our Human Resources Department for medical assistance, State Children's Services, Medicaid. Just don't take no for an answer. \n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. NEIMAN MACHINERY PLANT - EMPLOYEE SERVICE OFFICE - DAY\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">John sits in a cubicle across from his employer's insurance representative.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">INSURANCE REP.\n<P ID=\"dia\">You coverage has changed, Mr. Archibald.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Changed?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">INSURANCE REP.\n<P ID=\"dia\">We've recently switched carriers from a PPO to an HMO. It's a less expensive policy, but unfortunately it has some restrictions.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">What kind of restrictions?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">INSURANCE REP.\n<P ID=\"dia\">This is how it works. Non-management, part-time employees such as yourself only qualify for second tier catastrophic coverage.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">But I'm not part-time. I'm a full-time employee. It's just slow right now.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">INSURANCE REP.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Sure. But your coverage is based on house worked. Like I said, you only qualify for second tier, and that has a maximum payout limit of twenty-thousand dollars.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Wait a minute. I've been paying for my coverage for years. You take it out of my paycheck every week.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">INSURANCE REP.\n<P ID=\"dia\">And that's why we're going to cover you for the full twenty.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Let me get this straight. You drop me from full-time to part-time, switch carriers, and now you're telling me I'm not fully covered even though I have a policy that says I am.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">INSURANCE REP.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Doesn't seem right, does it?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">No, sir. It doesn't. My son is very sick. If I'm not covered, I've got a serious problem.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">INSURANCE REP.\n<P ID=\"dia\">I understand that, but there's nothing I can do. You might want to try State Services. Either that, or you can file an appeal.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The insurance rep pushes a stack of papers towards J.Q.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">INSURANCE REP.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Here are the forms. It'll take about seven working days.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. STATE SERVICES - DAY\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. and Denise at a window counter, talking to a STATE EMPLOYEE, who only knows what's on the computer screen in front of her.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">STATE REP\n<P ID=\"dia\">Says here you already have medical insurance.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Not enough.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DENISE\n<P ID=\"dia\">What little we have is already used up.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">STATE REP\n<P ID=\"dia\">I understand that. But then you don't qualify. We only give assistance to patients without coverage. Are you on Welfare?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">No.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">STATE REP\n<P ID=\"dia\">You should be on Welfare.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DENISE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Welfare? We both have jobs.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">STATE REP\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh, that's too bad. Sorry, I can't help you. Try MA.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. COUNTY MEDICAL ASSISTANCE - DAY\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">A county worker flips through J.Q.'s paperwork.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">COUNTY EMPLOYEE\n<P ID=\"dia\">It says here your son's condition is congenital.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">COUNTY EMPLOYEE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Not congenitive.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">So what? What's the difference?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">COUNTY EMPLOYEE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Big difference. It means it's a pre existing condition, one your son was born with. A birth defect. Obviously, it pre-dates your coverage. Otherwise we could help.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">That's impossible. He's had clean check ups every year.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">COUNTY EMPLOYEE\n<P ID=\"dia\">I don't know what to tell you. It's right here in the report.

I've got a kid who's dying and I'm broke. If I don't qualify, who does?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MEDICAID OFFICER\n<P ID=\"dia\">Lower your voice, sir.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">I mean, what do you guys do, anyway? Why does this service even exist?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MEDICAID OFFICER\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm sorry.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">I don't need you to be sorry.

An appeal is for an already existing claim. What you needed to file was a grievance. You'll have to resubmit. But that could take up to thirty days.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">I don't have thirty days.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n<P ID=\"dia\">I know that.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">And, frankly, I'm tired of getting the runaround. I need my son's name on that list.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Mr. Archibald, your hospital bill is in excess of thirty thousand dollars. So far, we haven't received any kind of payment. We have bent over backward to help you.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Oh, is that right?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yes, sir, that is right. But there is a limit to this hospital's generosity. Once and for all, you are not covered by insurance. We will need to guarantee payment.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">You want money? Alright, I'll get you your money. \n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT.

EMERGENCY WAITING ROOM - MORNING\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The broken, battered and bloodied sit on chairs waiting to be seen.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">A BABY BOY wails in the arms of his Hispanic mother, ROSA. MIRIAM, 28, hugely pregnant, sits next to her husband, STEVE, a contractor, dressed in paint-stained coveralls. LESTER, 23, a blood-soaked towel wrapped around his hand.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">MITCH, 30's, black jeans, shades, and a huge hangover, sits with his arm around his girlfriend, JULIE, a platinum bombshell. She's hurting. Her face is cut, her eyes swollen. DEBBY UTLEY, a young, sensitive nurse sits behind the admitting desk.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's going on? Are we going to get seen or what?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DEBBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">The doctor will be with you shortly, sir.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">MITCH Shortly? Shortly we could all be dead. We've been waiting damn near an hour.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The electric doors slide open and J.Q. enters and looks around before moving quickly through and disappearing into the main hospital entrance.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - CORRIDORS - MORNING\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. moves through the corridors intently, a man on a mission. Dr. Turner escorts a wheelchair to the hospital exit. In a wheelchair is a middle-aged man, dressed in designer casuals, a Rolex wrapped around his wrist. His name is CARROLL SHELBY, and he is a transplant patient. One of the lucky recipients. His elegantly dressed WIFE walks alongside.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n<P ID=\"dia\">You're doing great, Carroll. You've already gained back five pounds. I think you're the only patient I have who actually eats the food here.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">SHELBY'S WIFE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Thanks for everything, doctor.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. approaches the group. His face reveals nothing.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hello, John. This is Mr. Archibald. His son's a patient of mine.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">SHELBY'S WIFE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Well, you're certainly in good hands.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. forces a smile. The Shelbys say goodbye before leaving.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Denise said you're letting Mike go home.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n<P ID=\"dia\">Mr. Archibald, I'm a physician. I don't make policy decisions. That's handled by the board of trustees.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">You're head of Cardiac Surgery, Doctor. You're telling me a person in your position makes a recommendation, no one's going to listen?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n<P ID=\"dia\">I make recommendations all the time. The final decision rests with the board. Not me.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. wags a Hope Memorial brochure at Turner.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">You and your staff did over three hundred operations last year. It's right here on page 4 of the hospital brochure. Nice color pictures, happy faces. Three hundred plus surgeries at a quarter million a pop. That's seventy five million dollars your department took in. Couldn't you do just one on good faith?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n<P ID=\"dia\">Please take your hands off me.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm not asking for charity, Doc. I'll pay. I don't know how, but I swear to God, if it takes me the rest of my life, I will. You have my word as a man.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm sorry. I tried to help. But it's out of my hands.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Something in J.Q. snaps. Heart pounding, he pushes Turner through a pair of heavy metal doors and into the Emergency Room.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - MORNING\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. shoves Turner inside, pulls out a Baretta .9mm, points it at Turner's head.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm not asking anymore, Doctor. I'm telling. Now I want a new heart for my kid. You understand?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. drops the gym bag on the floor, unzips it, pulls out a length of heavy chain. Quickly, he wraps the chain around the power bar, threads a lock and clamps it shut. Turner marches over to a phone and picks it up. J.Q. sticks the weapon in his face.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q. (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Don't even think about it.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Turner hangs up the phone.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">SECURITY GUARD\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hey, what are you doing?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. sees the stocky SECURITY GUARD, trains the gun on him.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hands over your head. Do it.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The security guard nervously raises his hands above his head. This part wasn't covered in his training manual.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q. (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Give me your gun.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">SECURITY GUARD\n<P ID=\"dia\">I, uh, don't have a gun.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. reacts awkwardly, wasn't expecting this response.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Okay. Then sit down. And stay down.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The guard obediently drops into a chair.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n<P ID=\"dia\">Mr. Archibald, I understand how upset you are, but this is not the right way to handle it.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">I tried your way, Doc. It didn't work. Now we're going to try it my way.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">In one of the treatment rooms, Dr. Marjorie Klein and Leo Maguire attend to a man in motorcycle leathers with a bloodied head wound. They watch J.Q. lock the ambulance entrance.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. KLEIN\n<P ID=\"dia\">Mr. Archibald. What are you doing?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">I took your advice, Doctor. I'm not taking no for an answer.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Several patients and medical personnel see the gun and bolt out the front door. With Turner still in tow, J.Q. hurries to the ER entrance, pulls more chains from his gym bag and secures both doors. Turning back, he sees Lester at the admitting desk arguing with Debby Utley. A clipboard with medical information forms sits in front of him.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q. (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's going on here?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Lester removes the blood soaked towel. The tips of three fingers have been severed from his right hand.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">LESTER\n<P ID=\"dia\">They want me to sign.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The pen. The hand. It's not going to work.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n<P ID=\"dia\">Mr. Archibald, these people have nothing to do with this. You have got to let them go. They need treatment.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">This is a hospital, isn't it? You're a doctor. Treat them.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. points to Lester.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q. (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Start with him.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Turner stands frozen.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q. (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's the matter, Doc? You want to see his insurance card first?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. stands on a table addressing the room. A madman with a gun.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q. (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">This hospital is under new management, ladies and gentlemen. From now on, free care for everyone.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Various reactions from the people in the room.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">LESTER\n<P ID=\"dia\">Far out.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. points to the security guard.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">You. Come with me.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. leads the security guard to the elevators.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q. (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">Kill the power.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">SECURITY GUARD\n<P ID=\"dia\">I don't have a key for that.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">You've got the keys to the city. Now do it.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Decision time. Finally the guard inserts an Allen wrench into the lock and kills the power. J.Q. takes a crowbar from his bag and jimmies the elevator control box, busting fuses and yanking wires. The elevator looks sick. It's not going anywhere.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. looks around and sees a snake-eye security camera bolted to the ceiling.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - SECURITY DESK - DAY\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">A skinny, pimple-faced KID with a big chrome badge sits in front of a dozen closed circuit monitors. On one, a man in a baseball cap is now bashing the camera with a crowbar. Ssss! A blizzard of white snow crackles on the monitor. Confused, the pimply faced kid picks up the phone.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">PIMPLY FACED SECURITY GUARD \n<P ID=\"dia\">Uh. This is the security desk at Hope Memorial Hospital. I think you guys better get down here. We may have a situation. \n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. paces next to the windows, sizing up the room. Nearby, the Hispanic baby wails.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Everybody does exactly what I say and nobody gets hurt.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">He looks around the room, everybody battered, bloodied, and bruised.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q. (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">...more hurt.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. CONTROL ROOM - CHANNEL 8 - DAY\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">FREDDY B., a superbright techie-geek, pokes his head into an office where Tuck Lampley is having a meeting with his BOSSES.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">FREDDY B.\n<P ID=\"dia\">This just came in over the police radio. Someone is holding Hope Memorial hostage.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Realizing, Lampley stares at the TV executives.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">TV EXEC\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hope Memorial Hospital? Isn't that...?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Lampley is already up and on the move.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">LAMPLEY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Is it a good enough story for you now, George?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">FREDDY B.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Do you think it's that guy with the kid, boss?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">LAMPLEY\n<P ID=\"dia\">What do you think?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT.

Nobody's going anywhere for a while.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. glances at the admitting desk and sees the chair move. He lifts his weapon and moves towards it. He jumps around the corner of the desk to find Debby Utley underneath, scared to death.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q. (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm going to have to ask you to join the others, Miss.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The sound of a screaming baby is cutting through the room like nails on a blackboard. J.Q. approaches Rosa, who clutches her child defensively.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q. (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's the problem?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Rosa shakes her head. She doesn't speak much English.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ROSA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yo no se que pasa. El llora por toda la noche.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yo pienso que tiene dolor en su oreja.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">ROSA\n<P ID=\"dia\">Si? En su oido?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Porque lo toca. Mira.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The baby's tiny fingers reach for his ear. J.Q. singles out Debby Utley.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q. (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">This kid's got an ear infection. You.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">With J.Q.'s finger pointed at her, Debby falls apart, bursting into tears.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DEBBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I can't.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why not?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DEBBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">I don't know anything.

Good think I'm not cut. I'd bleed to death in this joint. Am I right, my man?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch tries to engage J.Q. with a wink and a big flashy smile.

LIEUTENANT FRANK GRIMES bails out before the car stops, smoothing out the wrinkles in his rumpled suit.

You're in a tough spot, John. A lot of trouble. But if you work with me, if you're reasonable, we'll figure a way out of this.

Surface scratches on his arms and around his neck and face.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">LESTER\n<P ID=\"dia\">Somebody get this man a band-aid.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Shut up, smart ass.

Mercedes didn't install passenger airbags until 1988.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">A long uncomfortable silence ensues as the group looks at Mitch, realizing the obvious. Busted.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">I was drunk. Alright?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Tears stream down Julie's proud face, for the first time, Mitch is speechless.

Denise stands vigilantly by Mike's bedside. Reggie enters. Carrying an armload of medicine. He replaces the IV bag and starts to administer the meds. One after the other, Reggie injects them into the IV line, and Mike stirs.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DENISE\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's that?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">REGGIE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Lasix. It's a diuretic to help get rid of some of the fluid build-up. But it's potassium sparing, so he needs this one to supplement.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DENISE\n<P ID=\"dia\">And those?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">REGGIE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Dopamine. For his blood pressure. Dig for his heart.

But I'm going to get you some of those crunchy ice chips to chew on. How does that sound?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mike forces a smile, dips his head slightly. \"Sounds good.\" Reggie leaves the room. Something catches Denise's eye. Down the Pediatric ICU, she sees the hospital chaplain again. There is a commotion. The parents are crying. And a sheet is pulled over her face of the now dead child. The chaplain tries to console the devastated mother, who screams as her child is wheeled out of the room.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MIKE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Mom? Is Dad coming?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DENISE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah. He's coming.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MIKE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Where is he?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Denise steals a final look at the parents overcome with grief.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DENISE\n<P ID=\"dia\">I don't know, sweetheart.

You're worthless. You know that? Some security guard. You should have zapped the bastard.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">SECURITY GUARD\n<P ID=\"dia\">With what? Besides, I'm not putting my neck on the line. Not for eight-fifty an hour.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mitch reaches, pulls a cas cart closer.

Next he spots a spray top cannister marked Ethychloride.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">What the hell are you doing?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Looking out for number one.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">SECURITY GUARD\n<P ID=\"dia\">You want to stay alive? Sit tight and wait for the cavalry to get here.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Wake up, fat boy. The cops are coming in shooting. They don't give a shit about his kid.

Everybody is chowing down.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">The thing I don't understand is why no one caught it before. Mike had check ups every year since the day he was born. Why didn't his doctors pick it up?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n<P ID=\"dia\">Was he ever diagnosed with a murmur?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah, he was. About a week after he was born. But his doctor said that was normal. That it happens all the time.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n<P ID=\"dia\">He might not have been tested thoroughly enough.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Why not?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MAGUIRE\n<P ID=\"dia\">You got an HMO, right? There's your answer. HMO's pay their doctors not to test. Their way of keeping costs down. Let's say Mike needed additional testing, insurance says they won't cover them. The doctor keeps his mouth shut and no one's the wiser. Little Mike falls through the cracks, and come Christmas, the HMO sends the doc a big, fat bonus check. J.Q. looks at Turner.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Is that true?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n<P ID=\"dia\">Possible. Not likely, but possible.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Then Mike's doctors could have known about his condition all along? And he could have been treated years ago?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n<P ID=\"dia\">Who knows?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">LESTER\n<P ID=\"dia\">Nothing personal, Doc, but you all are a bunch of damn crooks.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MAGUIRE\n<P ID=\"dia\">You see,here's the problem. Over here, you've got your insurance companies who basically want you healthy or dead. That's how they make money. And over here, you've got your medical establishment, doctors, pharmaceutical companies, who don't want you healthy or dead. They want you sick. That's the way they make money.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">LESTER\n<P ID=\"dia\">It's all about getting paid, man.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MAGUIRE\n<P ID=\"dia\">And the individual is caught in the middle of this gigantic tug-of-war. It's a game. And the end result is, people don't get the treatment they deserve.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">LESTER\n<P ID=\"dia\">Because then no one gets paid.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JULIE\n<P ID=\"dia\">But what about that thing you guys take?

How's that go, Doc? \"I solemnly swear to take care of all sick folk, except those without major medical?\"\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MAGUIRE\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm telling you, it's not that far from the truth. The shit happens all the time. Paramedics bring in some accident victim gasping for his last breath. Big boys in accounting find out they can't pay, they send them packing.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JULIE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hospitals can't turn people away.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">STEVE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah. I thought there were laws about that.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MAGUIRE\n<P ID=\"dia\">There are laws. But there are also ways around the laws. All we have to do is stabilize them. After that, we're off the hook.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Turner is getting hot.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR.

Maybe not up there on the fifth floor, but down here, if you ain't got no money, you get a band-aid, a foot in the ass, and you're out the door.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">Is that how you paid for that Armani suit, Doc?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Finally, Turner explodes.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DR.

And if you're looking for kindness and compassion, they're in short supply these days. But some of us got into medicine to do something about it. I break my ass every day trying to make a difference, trying to plug the dam. I'm in it up to my elbows. I've seen people live who shouldn't, and the other way around. And when I say I do my best, I mean it. So don't tell me about doctors, because they're the last stop between you and six feet under. And if you all want to regard me as some blood sucking vampire, fine. I'm the bad guy. But who's holding the fucking gun?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Turner gets up and walks into the treatment room.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JULIE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Wow.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MITCH\n<P ID=\"dia\">What's his problem?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">STEVE\n<P ID=\"dia\">I've got to be honest, if my kid was dying and I couldn't get help, I don't know what I'd do.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DEBBY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Me, neither.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">STEVE\n<P ID=\"dia\">But I'd do something.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. glances quickly at the clock.

The element of surprise gone, Mitch is now getting the worst of it. J.Q. is getting in some heavy blows and no one is stepping in to stop it.

The bailiff hands the verdict card to the judge who reads it before addressing the FOREMAN.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JUDGE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Has the jury reached a verdict?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The foreman stands, faces the judge.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JURY FORMAN\n<P ID=\"dia\">We have, Your Honor.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JUDGE\n<P ID=\"dia\">The defendant will please rise.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">AT THE DEFENDANT'S TABLE\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. Archibald gets up and faces the judge. His attorney, a P.D., by his side.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Standing next to Denise, we REVEAL MIKE - he looks healthy and rosy-cheeked. He grabs his mother's hand with anticipation.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JUDGE (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">The jury foreman will now read the verdict.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JURY FORMAN\n<P ID=\"dia\">As to count one, Assault with a deadly weapon, we find the defendant, John Quincy Archibald, not guilty.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The courtroom explodes in cheers. In the crowd, we see familiar faces: Debby, Dr. Turner, and Dr. Klein. Behind them, Maguire.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JURY FORMAN (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">On count two, Armed Criminal Action. Not guilty.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The crowd again roars its approval. Steve and Miriam watch from the gallery, holding a baby girl. Even Rebecca Payne cracks a smile.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JURY FORMAN (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">On the final count, False Imprisonment, we find the defendant, guilty. The crowd erupts in protest. The media rush out to file their stories.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DENISE\n<P ID=\"dia\">No!\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JUDGE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Quiet! Sentencing will be one week from today.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. stares straight ahead and takes a breath. After a moment, the public defender leads him over to the rail, where he is greeted by Jimmy, Gina, Denise and Mike.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">PUBLIC DEFENDER\n<P ID=\"dia\">He's going to do some time. But there's not a judge in the country that will give him more than a year. And with time served, John will be home very soon.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. leans over to talk to his son.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">You alright?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mike nods and stands there trying to hold back the tears.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q. (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">It's okay, slugger. I'll be home soon. If you need anything, ask your mother. And Jimmy and Gina will be around.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MIKE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Don't worry. If anybody messes with us, I'll take care of it.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. embraces his boy and moves over to Denise.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DENISE\n<P ID=\"dia\">A year, huh? I could have lost you forever. I guess I can live with that.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">A hand taps him on the shoulder. J.Q. looks up. Sees Grimes.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">GRIMES\n<P ID=\"dia\">Time to go, John.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">DENISE\n<P ID=\"dia\">John? I'm proud of you.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. smiles and Grimes starts to lead him away.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">JIMMY\n<P ID=\"dia\">Give 'em hell, Johnny. Don't worry about nothing.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MIKE\n<P ID=\"dia\">Bye, Dad.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Not goodbye. Remember? See you later.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">EXT. COURTROOM - MORNING\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">An enormous crowd lines both sides of the granite steps. They cheer their support as J.Q. emerges. Grimes steers J.Q. out through the confusion as reporters stick their mics in J.Q.'s face. They ask ridiculous questions about justice, health care, and politics. J.Q., uncomfortable with all the attention, has no comment. He pushes past politely, head down, his attention joslted when he hears a familiar voice.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">VOICE IN CROWD\n<P ID=\"dia\">Hey, John. Good luck, man.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">J.Q. recognizes the voice, turns and sees LESTER. Both smile to each other as J.Q. is pushed further through when --\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">REPORTER\n<P ID=\"dia\">John Q.? Do you feel like your country has let you down?\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"spkdir\">(quietly)\n<P ID=\"dia\">No. It's a wonderful country.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">REPORTER\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you. Could you repeat that?\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Grimes steps forward and speaks directly into the camera.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">GRIMES\n<P ID=\"dia\">He said, \"America is the greatest goddamn country in the world.\" Now excuse us, I have to take this man to jail.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">They push past the barricades and into the street. \n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">MEDIA\n<P ID=\"dia\">John Q.! John Q.!\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">GRIMES\n<P ID=\"dia\">Look at all this. You're a celebrity, John.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah? Check with me in a couple of days.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">They move to the street and Grimes opens the car door. J.Q. climbs inside. He looks up to see the CROWD, in all its glory, cameras flashing, microphones pointed at J.Q.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q. (CONT'D)\n<P ID=\"dia\">This is ridiculous. I don't even know these people.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">GRIMES\n<P ID=\"dia\">What can I tell you? You're their hero.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n<P ID=\"dia\">I'm not hero, Frank. I'm just a regular guy.\n\n<\/p><p><P ID=\"speaker\">GRIMES\n<P ID=\"dia\">Yeah, right.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Grimes slams the door. The \"cherry\" light spins, the siren wops and the cop car rolls through the crowd of people.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">On the street, J.Q. sees Mike wave to him from the sidewalk, trying to get John's attention. Mike is saying something. J.Q. turns to look closer and finally he gets it: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">Mike's lips say \"Thank you.\"\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">John winks at his boy.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS Mike makes a muscle.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">INT. POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">John smiles, and the car picks up speed.\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"slug\">EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">The cop car pulls away. Away from the courtroom. The circus. Finally disappearing from view and we --\n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">FADE TO BLACK.  \n\n<\/p><p><p ID=\"act\">THE END\n\n\n\n<\/div>\n\n<b>\n<\/b><b>\n<\/b>\n<b><\/b><\/pre><br>\n<table width=\"85%\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\">\n  <tr> \n\t<td align=center>\n\t<td><h1>John Q<\/h1><br><br>\n\t    <b>Writers<\/b> : &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/writer.php?w=James Kearns\" title=\"Scripts by James Kearns\">James Kearns<\/a><br>\n    \t<b>Genres<\/b> : &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/genre\/Crime\" title=\"Crime Scripts\">Crime<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/genre\/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/genre\/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller<\/a><br><br><br>\n\t\t\n\t\t<a href=\"\/Movie Scripts\/John Q Script.html#comments\" title=\"John Q comments\">User Comments<\/a>\n\t<\/td>\n<\/table>\n<br><br>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img src=\"\/images\/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"  alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=1><br>\nBack to IMSDb<\/a>\n<\/div><br>\n<br><br>\n  <\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<br><br>\n<\/table>\n\n<table width=\"99%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"body\">\n  <tr> \n  <td background=\"\/images\/reel.gif\" height=\"13\" colspan=\"2\">\n<\/table>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database (IMSDb)\">Index<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/submit\" title=\"Submit scripts\">Submit<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/links\" title=\"Other sites\">Links<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/link to us\" title=\"Link to IMSDb\">Link to us<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/feeds\" title=\"IMSDb RSS Feeds\">RSS Feeds<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/privacy\">Privacy policy<\/a> \n<\/div>\n\n<br \/>\n\n<\/body>\n<\/html>","id":893,"split":"train"}
