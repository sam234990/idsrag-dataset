{"ori_id":"36ed923f4e2c148dc5dc3570efaf847163619091","title":"The Haunted Bookshop","context":"The Haunted Bookshop\n This is a suspenseful novel set in Brooklyn around the time of the end of World War I. It continues the story of Roger Mifflin, the book seller in Parnassus on Wheels. It also details an adventure of Miss Titania Chapman and a young advertising man named Aubrey Gilbert.The narrative begins with a young advertising man, Aubrey Gilbert, stopping by a bookstore named \"The Haunted Bookshop\" in the hopes of finding a new client. Gilbert meets the proprietor, Roger Mifflin. Gilbert does not succeed in selling advertising copy, but is intrigued by Mifflin and his conviction concerning the value books and booksellers have to the world. Additionally, Gilbert is intrigued by the fact that his firm's biggest client, Mr. Chapman, is a friend of Mifflin and has asked Mifflin to undertake the education of his daughter, Titania Chapman, by hiring her as an assistant.\nGilbert returns to the book store, meets Titania, and falls in love with her. Meanwhile, mysterious things start to happen: a copy of Thomas Carlyle's Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell disappears and reappears, Gilbert is attacked as he travels home, a pharmacist neighbor of Mifflin is observed skulking in the alley behind the bookstore at night speaking to someone in German, and an assistant chef at the Octagon Hotel has posted an ad in the New York Times promising a reward for a lost copy of Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell. Gilbert starts to sense that something nefarious is afoot. He suspects that the gregarious Mifflin is involved in a plot to kidnap Titania, and he assigns himself the job of protecting her.\nMeanwhile, Mifflin begins to train Titania in the booksellers' trade. His focus is so centered on books and their content that he fails to note the unusual things that are occurring.\nGilbert takes a room across from the bookstore in order to keep eye on things, and believes his suspicions confirmed when he sees the pharmacist let himself into the bookshop with his own key late at night. Gilbert breaks into the bookshop in an effort to find evidence to prove his suspicions, but only manages to frighten and anger Titania.\nGilbert learns that Mifflin is to take a day trip to Philadelphia, and follows him in the belief that the trip is a part of the \"kidnapping\" plot. In Philadelphia Gilbert confronts Mifflin with his suspicions, telling him of all the things that have occurred. The two realize that a third party had lured Mifflin away from the shop. They call the bookshop and learn that the pharmacist has left a suitcase of books there for someone else to pick up. Mifflin tells Titania to hold on to the case until he returns.\nMifflin and Gilbert return to the bookshop and find it locked. Inside, the pharmacist and an associate of his have tied up Mrs. Mifflin and are menacing Titania with a gun.\nA fight ensues, part of the bookstore is destroyed by a bomb, and the pharmacist escapes. The only casualties of the bomb are the pharmacist's partner and Mifflin's dog, Bock. Mifflin even affects to be pleased as the blast knocked down books he'd forgotten he had.\nIn the final chapter of the book Gilbert and Mifflin learn what the true plot was: The pharmacist was a German spy who had been using the bookshop as a drop-off point. He was a specialist in making bombs, and had hidden a bomb in one of President Woodrow Wilson's favorite books. The pharmacist's co-conspirator was the assistant chef at the Octagon Hotel. He was to be part of the crew on the ship Wilson was to travel on to peace talks in Europe, and was to plant the bomb in Wilson's cabin in an assassination plot. The pharmacist was captured by police, and killed himself.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Haunted Bookshop, by Christopher Morley\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

The owner of the business has been at pains to remodel\nthe house to make it a more suitable shrine for his trade, which deals\nentirely in second-hand volumes.  There is no second-hand bookshop in\nthe world more worthy of respect.\n\nIt was about six o'clock of a cold November evening, with gusts of rain\nsplattering upon the pavement, when a young man proceeded uncertainly\nalong Gissing Street, stopping now and then to look at shop windows as\nthough doubtful of his way.  At the warm and shining face of a French\nrotisserie he halted to compare the number enamelled on the transom\nwith a memorandum in his hand.  Then he pushed on for a few minutes, at\nlast reaching the address he sought.  Over the entrance his eye was\ncaught by the sign:\n\n\n                       PARNASSUS AT HOME\n                       R. AND H. MIFFLIN\n                      BOOKLOVERS WELCOME!\n                     THIS SHOP IS HAUNTED\n\n\nHe stumbled down the three steps that led into the dwelling of the\nmuses, lowered his overcoat collar, and looked about.\n\nIt was very different from such bookstores as he had been accustomed to\npatronize.  Two stories of the old house had been thrown into one: the\nlower space was divided into little alcoves; above, a gallery ran round\nthe wall, which carried books to the ceiling.  The air was heavy with\nthe delightful fragrance of mellowed paper and leather surcharged with\na strong bouquet of tobacco.  In front of him he found a large placard\nin a frame:\n\n\n     THIS SHOP IS HAUNTED by the ghosts\n     Of all great literature, in hosts;\n\n     We sell no fakes or trashes.\n     Lovers of books are welcome here,\n     No clerks will babble in your ear,\n\n     Please smoke--but don't drop ashes!\n                             ----\n     Browse as long as you like.\n     Prices of all books plainly marked.\n     If you want to ask questions, you'll find the proprietor\n           where the tobacco smoke is thickest.\n     We pay cash for books.\n     We have what you want, though you may not know you want it.\n\n          Malnutrition of the reading faculty is a serious thing.\n\n     Let us prescribe for you.\n\n     By R. & H. MIFFLIN,\n                                     Proprs.\n\n\nThe shop had a warm and comfortable obscurity, a kind of drowsy dusk,\nstabbed here and there by bright cones of yellow light from\ngreen-shaded electrics.  There was an all-pervasive drift of tobacco\nsmoke, which eddied and fumed under the glass lamp shades.  Passing\ndown a narrow aisle between the alcoves the visitor noticed that some\nof the compartments were wholly in darkness; in others where lamps were\nglowing he could see a table and chairs.  In one corner, under a sign\nlettered ESSAYS, an elderly gentleman was reading, with a face of\nfanatical ecstasy illumined by the sharp glare of electricity; but\nthere was no wreath of smoke about him so the newcomer concluded he was\nnot the proprietor.\n\nAs the young man approached the back of the shop the general effect\nbecame more and more fantastic.  On some skylight far overhead he could\nhear the rain drumming; but otherwise the place was completely silent,\npeopled only (so it seemed) by the gurgitating whorls of smoke and the\nbright profile of the essay reader.  It seemed like a secret fane, some\nshrine of curious rites, and the young man's throat was tightened by a\nstricture which was half agitation and half tobacco.  Towering above\nhim into the gloom were shelves and shelves of books, darkling toward\nthe roof.  He saw a table with a cylinder of brown paper and twine,\nevidently where purchases might be wrapped; but there was no sign of an\nattendant.\n\n\"This place may indeed be haunted,\" he thought, \"perhaps by the\ndelighted soul of Sir Walter Raleigh, patron of the weed, but seemingly\nnot by the proprietors.\"\n\nHis eyes, searching the blue and vaporous vistas of the shop, were\ncaught by a circle of brightness that shone with a curious egg-like\nlustre.  It was round and white, gleaming in the sheen of a hanging\nlight, a bright island in a surf of tobacco smoke.  He came more close,\nand found it was a bald head.\n\nThis head (he then saw) surmounted a small, sharp-eyed man who sat\ntilted back in a swivel chair, in a corner which seemed the nerve\ncentre of the establishment.  The large pigeon-holed desk in front of\nhim was piled high with volumes of all sorts, with tins of tobacco and\nnewspaper clippings and letters.  An antiquated typewriter, looking\nsomething like a harpsichord, was half-buried in sheets of manuscript.\nThe little bald-headed man was smoking a corn-cob pipe and reading a\ncook-book.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said the caller, pleasantly; \"is this the\nproprietor?\"\n\nMr. Roger Mifflin, the proprietor of \"Parnassus at Home,\" looked up,\nand the visitor saw that he had keen blue eyes, a short red beard, and\na convincing air of competent originality.\n\n\"It is,\" said Mr. Mifflin.  \"Anything I can do for you?\"\n\n\"My name is Aubrey Gilbert,\" said the young man.  \"I am representing\nthe Grey-Matter Advertising Agency.  I want to discuss with you the\nadvisability of your letting us handle your advertising account,\nprepare snappy copy for you, and place it in large circulation mediums.\nNow the war's over, you ought to prepare some constructive campaign for\nbigger business.\"\n\nThe bookseller's face beamed.  He put down his cook-book, blew an\nexpanding gust of smoke, and looked up brightly.\n\n\"My dear chap,\" he said, \"I don't do any advertising.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" cried the other, aghast as at some gratuitous indecency.\n\n\"Not in the sense you mean.  Such advertising as benefits me most is\ndone for me by the snappiest copywriters in the business.\"\n\n\"I suppose you refer to Whitewash and Gilt?\" said Mr. Gilbert wistfully.\n\n\"Not at all.  The people who are doing my advertising are Stevenson,\nBrowning, Conrad and Company.\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" said the Grey-Matter solicitor.  \"I don't know that agency\nat all.  Still, I doubt if their copy has more pep than ours.\"\n\n\"I don't think you get me.  I mean that my advertising is done by the\nbooks I sell.  If I sell a man a book by Stevenson or Conrad, a book\nthat delights or terrifies him, that man and that book become my living\nadvertisements.\"\n\n\"But that word-of-mouth advertising is exploded,\" said Gilbert.  \"You\ncan't get Distribution that way.  You've got to keep your trademark\nbefore the public.\"\n\n\"By the bones of Tauchnitz!\" cried Mifflin.  \"Look here, you wouldn't\ngo to a doctor, a medical specialist, and tell him he ought to\nadvertise in papers and magazines?  A doctor is advertised by the\nbodies he cures.  My business is advertised by the minds I stimulate.\nAnd let me tell you that the book business is different from other\ntrades.  People don't know they want books.  I can see just by looking\nat you that your mind is ill for lack of books but you are blissfully\nunaware of it!  People don't go to a bookseller until some serious\nmental accident or disease makes them aware of their danger.  Then they\ncome here.  For me to advertise would be about as useful as telling\npeople who feel perfectly well that they ought to go to the doctor.  Do\nyou know why people are reading more books now than ever before?\nBecause the terrific catastrophe of the war has made them realize that\ntheir minds are ill.  The world was suffering from all sorts of mental\nfevers and aches and disorders, and never knew it.  Now our mental\npangs are only too manifest.  We are all reading, hungrily, hastily,\ntrying to find out--after the trouble is over--what was the matter with\nour minds.\"\n\nThe little bookseller was standing up now, and his visitor watched him\nwith mingled amusement and alarm.\n\n\"You know,\" said Mifflin, \"I am interested that you should have thought\nit worth while to come in here.  It reinforces my conviction of the\namazing future ahead of the book business.  But I tell you that future\nlies not merely in systematizing it as a trade.  It lies in dignifying\nit as a profession.  It is small use to jeer at the public for craving\nshoddy books, quack books, untrue books.  Physician, cure thyself!  Let\nthe bookseller learn to know and revere good books, he will teach the\ncustomer.  The hunger for good books is more general and more insistent\nthan you would dream.  But it is still in a way subconscious.  People\nneed books, but they don't know they need them.  Generally they are not\naware that the books they need are in existence.\"\n\n\"Why wouldn't advertising be the way to let them know?\" asked the young\nman, rather acutely.\n\n\"My dear chap, I understand the value of advertising.  But in my own\ncase it would be futile.  I am not a dealer in merchandise but a\nspecialist in adjusting the book to the human need.  Between ourselves,\nthere is no such thing, abstractly, as a 'good' book.  A book is 'good'\nonly when it meets some human hunger or refutes some human error.  A\nbook that is good for me would very likely be punk for you.  My\npleasure is to prescribe books for such patients as drop in here and\nare willing to tell me their symptoms.  Some people have let their\nreading faculties decay so that all I can do is hold a post mortem on\nthem.  But most are still open to treatment.  There is no one so\ngrateful as the man to whom you have given just the book his soul\nneeded and he never knew it.  No advertisement on earth is as potent as\na grateful customer.\n\n\"I will tell you another reason why I don't advertise,\" he continued.\n\"In these days when everyone keeps his trademark before the public, as\nyou call it, not to advertise is the most original and startling thing\none can do to attract attention.  It was the fact that I do NOT\nadvertise that drew you here.  And everyone who comes here thinks he\nhas discovered the place himself.  He goes and tells his friends about\nthe book asylum run by a crank and a lunatic, and they come here in\nturn to see what it is like.\"\n\n\"I should like to come here again myself and browse about,\" said the\nadvertising agent.  \"I should like to have you prescribe for me.\"\n\n\"The first thing needed is to acquire a sense of pity.  The world has\nbeen printing books for 450 years, and yet gunpowder still has a wider\ncirculation.  Never mind!  Printer's ink is the greater explosive: it\nwill win.  Yes, I have a few of the good books here.  There are only\nabout 30,000 really important books in the world.  I suppose about\n5,000 of them were written in the English language, and 5,000 more have\nbeen translated.\"\n\n\"You are open in the evenings?\"\n\n\"Until ten o'clock.  A great many of my best customers are those who\nare at work all day and can only visit bookshops at night.  The real\nbook-lovers, you know, are generally among the humbler classes.  A man\nwho is impassioned with books has little time or patience to grow rich\nby concocting schemes for cozening his fellows.\"\n\nThe little bookseller's bald pate shone in the light of the bulb\nhanging over the wrapping table.  His eyes were bright and earnest, his\nshort red beard bristled like wire.  He wore a ragged brown Norfolk\njacket from which two buttons were missing.\n\nA bit of a fanatic himself, thought the customer, but a very\nentertaining one.  \"Well, sir,\" he said, \"I am ever so grateful to you.\nI'll come again.  Good-night.\"  And he started down the aisle for the\ndoor.\n\nAs he neared the front of the shop, Mr. Mifflin switched on a cluster\nof lights that hung high up, and the young man found himself beside a\nlarge bulletin board covered with clippings, announcements, circulars,\nand little notices written on cards in a small neat script.  The\nfollowing caught his eye:\n\n\nRX\n\nIf your mind needs phosphorus, try \"Trivia,\" by Logan Pearsall Smith.\n\nIf your mind needs a whiff of strong air, blue and cleansing, from\nhilltops and primrose valleys, try \"The Story of My Heart,\" by Richard\nJefferies.\n\nIf your mind needs a tonic of iron and wine, and a thorough\nrough-and-tumbling, try Samuel Butler's \"Notebooks\" or \"The Man Who Was\nThursday,\" by Chesterton.\n\nIf you need \"all manner of Irish,\" and a relapse into irresponsible\nfreakishness, try \"The Demi-Gods,\" by James Stephens.  It is a better\nbook than one deserves or expects.\n\nIt's a good thing to turn your mind upside down now and then, like an\nhour-glass, to let the particles run the other way.\n\nOne who loves the English tongue can have a lot of fun with a Latin\ndictionary.\n\n                                           ROGER MIFFLIN.\n\n\nHuman beings pay very little attention to what is told them unless they\nknow something about it already.  The young man had heard of none of\nthese books prescribed by the practitioner of bibliotherapy.  He was\nabout to open the door when Mifflin appeared at his side.\n\n\"Look here,\" he said, with a quaint touch of embarrassment.  \"I was\nvery much interested by our talk.  I'm all alone this evening--my wife\nis away on a holiday.  Won't you stay and have supper with me?  I was\njust looking up some new recipes when you came in.\"\n\nThe other was equally surprised and pleased by this unusual invitation.\n\n\"Why--that's very good of you,\" he said.  \"Are you sure I won't be\nintruding?\"\n\n\"Not at all!\" cried the bookseller.  \"I detest eating alone: I was\nhoping someone would drop in.  I always try to have a guest for supper\nwhen my wife is away.  I have to stay at home, you see, to keep an eye\non the shop.  We have no servant, and I do the cooking myself.  It's\ngreat fun.  Now you light your pipe and make yourself comfortable for a\nfew minutes while I get things ready.  Suppose you come back to my den.\"\n\nOn a table of books at the front of the shop Mifflin laid a large card\nlettered:\n\n\n     PROPRIETOR AT SUPPER\n     IF YOU WANT ANYTHING\n     RING THIS BELL\n\n\nBeside the card he placed a large old-fashioned dinner bell, and then\nled the way to the rear of the shop.\n\nBehind the little office in which this unusual merchant had been\nstudying his cook-book a narrow stairway rose on each side, running up\nto the gallery.  Behind these stairs a short flight of steps led to the\ndomestic recesses.  The visitor found himself ushered into a small room\non the left, where a grate of coals glowed under a dingy mantelpiece of\nyellowish marble.  On the mantel stood a row of blackened corn-cob\npipes and a canister of tobacco.  Above was a startling canvas in\nemphatic oils, representing a large blue wagon drawn by a stout white\nanimal--evidently a horse.  A background of lush scenery enhanced the\nforceful technique of the limner.  The walls were stuffed with books.\nTwo shabby, comfortable chairs were drawn up to the iron fender, and a\nmustard-coloured terrier was lying so close to the glow that a smell of\nsinged hair was sensible.\n\n\"There,\" said the host; \"this is my cabinet, my chapel of ease.  Take\noff your coat and sit down.\"\n\n\"Really,\" began Gilbert, \"I'm afraid this is----\"\n\n\"Nonsense!  Now you sit down and commend your soul to Providence and\nthe kitchen stove.  I'll bustle round and get supper.\" Gilbert pulled\nout his pipe, and with a sense of elation prepared to enjoy an unusual\nevening.  He was a young man of agreeable parts, amiable and sensitive.\nHe knew his disadvantages in literary conversation, for he had gone to\nan excellent college where glee clubs and theatricals had left him\nlittle time for reading.  But still he was a lover of good books,\nthough he knew them chiefly by hearsay.  He was twenty-five years old,\nemployed as a copywriter by the Grey-Matter Advertising Agency.\n\nThe little room in which he found himself was plainly the bookseller's\nsanctum, and contained his own private library.  Gilbert browsed along\nthe shelves curiously.  The volumes were mostly shabby and bruised;\nthey had evidently been picked up one by one in the humble mangers of\nthe second-hand vendor.  They all showed marks of use and meditation.\n\nMr. Gilbert had the earnest mania for self-improvement which has\nblighted the lives of so many young men--a passion which, however, is\ncommendable in those who feel themselves handicapped by a college\ncareer and a jewelled fraternity emblem.  It suddenly struck him that\nit would be valuable to make a list of some of the titles in Mifflin's\ncollection, as a suggestion for his own reading.  He took out a\nmemorandum book and began jotting down the books that intrigued him:\n\n\n\n     The Works of Francis Thompson (3 vols.)\n     Social History of Smoking:  Apperson\n     The Path to Rome:  Hilaire Belloc\n     The Book of Tea:  Kakuzo\n     Happy Thoughts:  F. C. Burnand\n     Dr. Johnson's Prayers and Meditations\n     Margaret Ogilvy:  J. M. Barrie\n     Confessions of a Thug:  Taylor\n     General Catalogue of the Oxford University Press\n     The Morning's War:  C. E. Montague\n     The Spirit of Man:  edited by Robert Bridges\n     The Romany Rye:  Borrow\n     Poems:  Emily Dickinson\n     Poems:  George Herbert\n     The House of Cobwebs:  George Gissing\n\n\nSo far had he got, and was beginning to say to himself that in the\ninterests of Advertising (who is a jealous mistress) he had best call a\nhalt, when his host entered the room, his small face eager, his eyes\nblue points of light.\n\n\"Come, Mr. Aubrey Gilbert!\" he cried.  \"The meal is set.  You want to\nwash your hands?  Make haste then, this way: the eggs are hot and\nwaiting.\"\n\nThe dining-room into which the guest was conducted betrayed a feminine\ntouch not visible in the smoke-dimmed quarters of shop and cabinet.  At\nthe windows were curtains of laughing chintz and pots of pink geranium.\nThe table, under a drop-light in a flame-coloured silk screen, was\nbrightly set with silver and blue china.  In a cut-glass decanter\nsparkled a ruddy brown wine.  The edged tool of Advertising felt his\nspirits undergo an unmistakable upward pressure.\n\n\"Sit down, sir,\" said Mifflin, lifting the roof of a platter.  \"These\nare eggs Samuel Butler, an invention of my own, the apotheosis of hen\nfruit.\"\n\nGilbert greeted the invention with applause.  An Egg Samuel Butler, for\nthe notebook of housewives, may be summarized as a pyramid, based upon\ntoast, whereof the chief masonries are a flake of bacon, an egg poached\nto firmness, a wreath of mushrooms, a cap-sheaf of red peppers; the\nwhole dribbled with a warm pink sauce of which the inventor retains the\nsecret.  To this the bookseller chef added fried potatoes from another\ndish, and poured for his guest a glass of wine.\n\n\"This is California catawba,\" said Mifflin, \"in which the grape and the\nsunshine very pleasantly (and cheaply) fulfil their allotted destiny.\nI pledge you prosperity to the black art of Advertising!\"\n\nThe psychology of the art and mystery of Advertising rests upon tact,\nan instinctive perception of the tone and accent which will be en\nrapport with the mood of the hearer.  Mr. Gilbert was aware of this,\nand felt that quite possibly his host was prouder of his whimsical\navocation as gourmet than of his sacred profession as a bookman.\n\n\"Is it possible, sir,\" he began, in lucid Johnsonian, \"that you can\nconcoct so delicious an entree in so few minutes?  You are not hoaxing\nme?  There is no secret passage between Gissing Street and the\nlaboratories of the Ritz?\"\n\n\"Ah, you should taste Mrs. Mifflin's cooking!\" said the bookseller.  \"I\nam only an amateur, who dabbles in the craft during her absence.  She\nis on a visit to her cousin in Boston.  She becomes, quite justifiably,\nweary of the tobacco of this establishment, and once or twice a year it\ndoes her good to breathe the pure serene of Beacon Hill.  During her\nabsence it is my privilege to inquire into the ritual of housekeeping.\nI find it very sedative after the incessant excitement and speculation\nof the shop.\"\n\n\"I should have thought,\" said Gilbert, \"that life in a bookshop would\nbe delightfully tranquil.\"\n\n\"Far from it.  Living in a bookshop is like living in a warehouse of\nexplosives.  Those shelves are ranked with the most furious\ncombustibles in the world--the brains of men.  I can spend a rainy\nafternoon reading, and my mind works itself up to such a passion and\nanxiety over mortal problems as almost unmans me.  It is terribly\nnerve-racking.  Surround a man with Carlyle, Emerson, Thoreau,\nChesterton, Shaw, Nietzsche, and George Ade--would you wonder at his\ngetting excited?  What would happen to a cat if she had to live in a\nroom tapestried with catnip?  She would go crazy!\"\n\n\"Truly, I had never thought of that phase of bookselling,\" said the\nyoung man.  \"How is it, though, that libraries are shrines of such\naustere calm?  If books are as provocative as you suggest, one would\nexpect every librarian to utter the shrill screams of a hierophant, to\nclash ecstatic castanets in his silent alcoves!\"\n\n\"Ah, my boy, you forget the card index!  Librarians invented that\nsoothing device for the febrifuge of their souls, just as I fall back\nupon the rites of the kitchen.  Librarians would all go mad, those\ncapable of concentrated thought, if they did not have the cool and\nhealing card index as medicament!  Some more of the eggs?\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Gilbert.  \"Who was the butler whose name was\nassociated with the dish?\"\n\n\"What?\" cried Mifflin, in agitation, \"you have not heard of Samuel\nButler, the author of The Way of All Flesh?  My dear young man, whoever\npermits himself to die before he has read that book, and also Erewhon,\nhas deliberately forfeited his chances of paradise.  For paradise in\nthe world to come is uncertain, but there is indeed a heaven on this\nearth, a heaven which we inhabit when we read a good book.  Pour\nyourself another glass of wine, and permit me----\"\n\n(Here followed an enthusiastic development of the perverse philosophy\nof Samuel Butler, which, in deference to my readers, I omit.  Mr.\nGilbert took notes of the conversation in his pocketbook, and I am\npleased to say that his heart was moved to a realization of his\niniquity, for he was observed at the Public Library a few days later\nasking for a copy of The Way of All Flesh.  After inquiring at four\nlibraries, and finding all copies of the book in circulation, he was\ncompelled to buy one.  He never regretted doing so.)\n\n\"But I am forgetting my duties as host,\" said Mifflin.  \"Our dessert\nconsists of apple sauce, gingerbread, and coffee.\" He rapidly cleared\nthe empty dishes from the table and brought on the second course.\n\n\"I have been noticing the warning over the sideboard,\" said Gilbert.\n\"I hope you will let me help you this evening?\"  He pointed to a card\nhanging near the kitchen door.  It read:\n\n\n     ALWAYS WASH DISHES\n     IMMEDIATELY AFTER MEALS\n     IT SAVES TROUBLE\n\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't always obey that precept,\" said the bookseller as\nhe poured the coffee.  \"Mrs. Mifflin hangs it there whenever she goes\naway, to remind me.  But, as our friend Samuel Butler says, he that is\nstupid in little will also be stupid in much.  I have a different\ntheory about dish-washing, and I please myself by indulging it.\n\n\"I used to regard dish-washing merely as an ignoble chore, a kind of\nhateful discipline which had to be undergone with knitted brow and\nbrazen fortitude.  When my wife went away the first time, I erected a\nreading stand and an electric light over the sink, and used to read\nwhile my hands went automatically through base gestures of\npurification.  I made the great spirits of literature partners of my\nsorrow, and learned by heart a good deal of Paradise Lost and of Walt\nMason, while I soused and wallowed among pots and pans.  I used to\ncomfort myself with two lines of Keats:\n\n\n     'The moving waters at their priest-like task\n     Of pure ablution round earth's human shores----'\n\n\nThen a new conception of the matter struck me.  It is intolerable for a\nhuman being to go on doing any task as a penance, under duress.  No\nmatter what the work is, one must spiritualize it in some way, shatter\nthe old idea of it into bits and rebuild it nearer to the heart's\ndesire.  How was I to do this with dish-washing?\n\n\"I broke a good many plates while I was pondering over the matter.\nThen it occurred to me that here was just the relaxation I needed.  I\nhad been worrying over the mental strain of being surrounded all day\nlong by vociferous books, crying out at me their conflicting views as\nto the glories and agonies of life.  Why not make dish-washing my balm\nand poultice?\n\n\"When one views a stubborn fact from a new angle, it is amazing how all\nits contours and edges change shape!  Immediately my dishpan began to\nglow with a kind of philosophic halo!  The warm, soapy water became a\nsovereign medicine to retract hot blood from the head; the homely act\nof washing and drying cups and saucers became a symbol of the order and\ncleanliness that man imposes on the unruly world about him.  I tore\ndown my book rack and reading lamp from over the sink.\n\n\"Mr. Gilbert,\" he went on, \"do not laugh at me when I tell you that I\nhave evolved a whole kitchen philosophy of my own.  I find the kitchen\nthe shrine of our civilization, the focus of all that is comely in\nlife.  The ruddy shine of the stove is as beautiful as any sunset.  A\nwell-polished jug or spoon is as fair, as complete and beautiful, as\nany sonnet.  The dish mop, properly rinsed and wrung and hung outside\nthe back door to dry, is a whole sermon in itself.  The stars never\nlook so bright as they do from the kitchen door after the ice-box pan\nis emptied and the whole place is 'redd up,' as the Scotch say.\"\n\n\"A very delightful philosophy indeed,\" said Gilbert.  \"And now that we\nhave finished our meal, I insist upon your letting me give you a hand\nwith the washing up.  I am eager to test this dish-pantheism of yours!\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said Mifflin, laying a restraining hand on his\nimpetuous guest, \"it is a poor philosophy that will not abide denial\nnow and then.  No, no--I did not ask you to spend the evening with me\nto wash dishes.\"  And he led the way back to his sitting room.\n\n\"When I saw you come in,\" said Mifflin, \"I was afraid you might be a\nnewspaper man, looking for an interview.  A young journalist came to\nsee us once, with very unhappy results.  He wheedled himself into Mrs.\nMifflin's good graces, and ended by putting us both into a book, called\nParnassus on Wheels, which has been rather a trial to me.  In that book\nhe attributes to me a number of shallow and sugary observations upon\nbookselling that have been an annoyance to the trade.  I am happy to\nsay, though, that his book had only a trifling sale.\"\n\n\"I have never heard of it,\" said Gilbert.\n\n\"If you are really interested in bookselling you should come here some\nevening to a meeting of the Corn Cob Club.  Once a month a number of\nbooksellers gather here and we discuss matters of bookish concern over\ncorn-cobs and cider.  We have all sorts and conditions of booksellers:\none is a fanatic on the subject of libraries.  He thinks that every\npublic library should be dynamited.  Another thinks that moving\npictures will destroy the book trade.  What rot!  Surely everything\nthat arouses people's minds, that makes them alert and questioning,\nincreases their appetite for books.\"\n\n\"The life of a bookseller is very demoralizing to the intellect,\" he\nwent on after a pause.  \"He is surrounded by innumerable books; he\ncannot possibly read them all; he dips into one and picks up a scrap\nfrom another.  His mind gradually fills itself with miscellaneous\nflotsam, with superficial opinions, with a thousand half-knowledges.\nAlmost unconsciously he begins to rate literature according to what\npeople ask for.  He begins to wonder whether Ralph Waldo Trine isn't\nreally greater than Ralph Waldo Emerson, whether J. M. Chapple isn't as\nbig a man as J. M. Barrie.  That way lies intellectual suicide.\n\n\"One thing, however, you must grant the good bookseller.  He is\ntolerant.  He is patient of all ideas and theories.  Surrounded,\nengulfed by the torrent of men's words, he is willing to listen to them\nall.  Even to the publisher's salesman he turns an indulgent ear.  He\nis willing to be humbugged for the weal of humanity.  He hopes\nunceasingly for good books to be born.\n\n\"My business, you see, is different from most.  I only deal in\nsecond-hand books; I only buy books that I consider have some honest\nreason for existence.  In so far as human judgment can discern, I try\nto keep trash out of my shelves.  A doctor doesn't traffic in quack\nremedies.  I don't traffic in bogus books.\n\n\"A comical thing happened the other day.  There is a certain wealthy\nman, a Mr. Chapman, who has long frequented this shop----\"\n\n\"I wonder if that could be Mr. Chapman of the Chapman Daintybits\nCompany?\" said Gilbert, feeling his feet touch familiar soil.\n\n\"The same, I believe,\" said Mifflin.  \"Do you know him?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" cried the young man with reverence.  \"There is a man who can tell\nyou the virtues of advertising.  If he is interested in books, it is\nadvertising that made it possible.  We handle all his copy--I've\nwritten a lot of it myself.  We have made the Chapman prunes a staple\nof civilization and culture.  I myself devised that slogan 'We preen\nourselves on our prunes' which you see in every big magazine.  Chapman\nprunes are known the world over.  The Mikado eats them once a week.\nThe Pope eats them.  Why, we have just heard that thirteen cases of\nthem are to be put on board the George Washington for the President's\nvoyage to the peace Conference.  The Czecho-Slovak armies were fed\nlargely on prunes.  It is our conviction in the office that our\ncampaign for the Chapman prunes did much to win the war.\"\n\n\"I read in an ad the other day--perhaps you wrote that, too?\" said the\nbookseller, \"that the Elgin watch had won the war.  However, Mr.\nChapman has long been one of my best customers.  He heard about the\nCorn Cob Club, and though of course he is not a bookseller he begged to\ncome to our meetings.  We were glad to have him do so, and he has\nentered into our discussions with great zeal.  Often he has offered\nmany a shrewd comment.  He has grown so enthusiastic about the\nbookseller's way of life that the other day he wrote to me about his\ndaughter (he is a widower).  She has been attending a fashionable\ngirls' school where, he says, they have filled her head with absurd,\nwasteful, snobbish notions.  He says she has no more idea of the\nusefulness and beauty of life than a Pomeranian dog.  Instead of\nsending her to college, he has asked me if Mrs. Mifflin and I will take\nher in here to learn to sell books.  He wants her to think she is\nearning her keep, and is going to pay me privately for the privilege of\nhaving her live here.  He thinks that being surrounded by books will\nput some sense in her head.  I am rather nervous about the experiment,\nbut it is a compliment to the shop, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Ye gods,\" cried Gilbert, \"what advertising copy that would make!\"\n\nAt this point the bell in the shop rang, and Mifflin jumped up.  \"This\npart of the evening is often rather busy,\" he said.  \"I'm afraid I'll\nhave to go down on the floor.  Some of my habitues rather expect me to\nbe on hand to gossip about books.\"\n\n\"I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed myself,\" said Gilbert.  \"I'm\ngoing to come again and study your shelves.\"\n\n\"Well, keep it dark about the young lady,\" said the bookseller.  \"I\ndon't want all you young blades dropping in here to unsettle her mind.\nIf she falls in love with anybody in this shop, it'll have to be Joseph\nConrad or John Keats!\"\n\nAs he passed out, Gilbert saw Roger Mifflin engaged in argument with a\nbearded man who looked like a college professor.  \"Carlyle's Oliver\nCromwell?\" he was saying.  \"Yes, indeed!  Right over here!  Hullo,\nthat's odd!  It WAS here.\"\n\n\n\nChapter II\n\nThe Corn Cob Club[1]\n\n\n[1] The latter half of this chapter may be omitted by all readers who\nare not booksellers.\n\n\nThe Haunted Bookshop was a delightful place, especially of an evening,\nwhen its drowsy alcoves were kindled with the brightness of lamps\nshining on the rows of volumes.  Many a passer-by would stumble down\nthe steps from the street in sheer curiosity; others, familiar\nvisitors, dropped in with the same comfortable emotion that a man feels\non entering his club.  Roger's custom was to sit at his desk in the\nrear, puffing his pipe and reading; though if any customer started a\nconversation, the little man was quick and eager to carry it on.  The\nlion of talk lay only sleeping in him; it was not hard to goad it up.\n\nIt may be remarked that all bookshops that are open in the evening are\nbusy in the after-supper hours.  Is it that the true book-lovers are\nnocturnal gentry, only venturing forth when darkness and silence and\nthe gleam of hooded lights irresistibly suggest reading?  Certainly\nnight-time has a mystic affinity for literature, and it is strange that\nthe Esquimaux have created no great books.  Surely, for most of us, an\narctic night would be insupportable without O. Henry and Stevenson.\nOr, as Roger Mifflin remarked during a passing enthusiasm for Ambrose\nBierce, the true noctes ambrosianae are the noctes ambrose bierceianae.\n\nBut Roger was prompt in closing Parnassus at ten o'clock.  At that hour\nhe and Bock (the mustard-coloured terrier, named for Boccaccio) would\nmake the round of the shop, see that everything was shipshape, empty\nthe ash trays provided for customers, lock the front door, and turn off\nthe lights.  Then they would retire to the den, where Mrs. Mifflin was\ngenerally knitting or reading.  She would brew a pot of cocoa and they\nwould read or talk for half an hour or so before bed.  Sometimes Roger\nwould take a stroll along Gissing Street before turning in.  All day\nspent with books has a rather exhausting effect on the mind, and he\nused to enjoy the fresh air sweeping up the dark Brooklyn streets,\nmeditating some thought that had sprung from his reading, while Bock\nsniffed and padded along in the manner of an elderly dog at night.\n\nWhile Mrs. Mifflin was away, however, Roger's routine was somewhat\ndifferent.  After closing the shop he would return to his desk and with\na furtive, shamefaced air take out from a bottom drawer an untidy\nfolder of notes and manuscript.  This was the skeleton in his closet,\nhis secret sin.  It was the scaffolding of his book, which he had been\ncompiling for at least ten years, and to which he had tentatively\nassigned such different titles as \"Notes on Literature,\" \"The Muse on\nCrutches,\" \"Books and I,\" and \"What a Young Bookseller Ought to Know.\"\nIt had begun long ago, in the days of his odyssey as a rural book\nhuckster, under the title of \"Literature Among the Farmers,\" but it had\nbranched out until it began to appear that (in bulk at least) Ridpath\nwould have to look to his linoleum laurels.  The manuscript in its\npresent state had neither beginning nor end, but it was growing\nstrenuously in the middle, and hundreds of pages were covered with\nRoger's minute script.  The chapter on \"Ars Bibliopolae,\" or the art of\nbookselling, would be, he hoped, a classic among generations of book\nvendors still unborn.  Seated at his disorderly desk, caressed by a\ncounterpane of drifting tobacco haze, he would pore over the\nmanuscript, crossing out, interpolating, re-arguing, and then referring\nto volumes on his shelves.  Bock would snore under the chair, and soon\nRoger's brain would begin to waver.  In the end he would fall asleep\nover his papers, wake with a cramp about two o'clock, and creak\nirritably to a lonely bed.\n\nAll this we mention only to explain how it was that Roger was dozing at\nhis desk about midnight, the evening after the call paid by Aubrey\nGilbert.  He was awakened by a draught of chill air passing like a\nmountain brook over his bald pate.  Stiffly he sat up and looked about.\nThe shop was in darkness save for the bright electric over his head.\nBock, of more regular habit than his master, had gone back to his couch\nin the kitchen, made of a packing case that had once coffined a set of\nthe Encyclopaedia Britannica.\n\n\"That's funny,\" said Roger to himself.  \"Surely I locked the door?\" He\nwalked to the front of the shop, switching on the cluster of lights\nthat hung from the ceiling.  The door was ajar, but everything else\nseemed as usual.  Bock, hearing his footsteps, came trotting out from\nthe kitchen, his claws rattling on the bare wooden floor.  He looked up\nwith the patient inquiry of a dog accustomed to the eccentricities of\nhis patron.\n\n\"I guess I'm getting absent-minded,\" said Roger.  \"I must have left the\ndoor open.\"  He closed and locked it.  Then he noticed that the terrier\nwas sniffing in the History alcove, which was at the front of the shop\non the left-hand side.\n\n\"What is it, old man?\" said Roger.  \"Want something to read in bed?\" He\nturned on the light in that alcove.  Everything appeared normal.  Then\nhe noticed a book that projected an inch or so beyond the even line of\nbindings.  It was a fad of Roger's to keep all his books in a flat row\non the shelves, and almost every evening at closing time he used to run\nhis palm along the backs of the volumes to level any irregularities\nleft by careless browsers.  He put out a hand to push the book into\nplace.  Then he stopped.\n\n\"Queer again,\" he thought.  \"Carlyle's Oliver Cromwell!  I looked for\nthat book last night and couldn't find it.  When that professor fellow\nwas here.  Maybe I'm tired and can't see straight.  I'll go to bed.\"\n\n\nThe next day was a date of some moment.  Not only was it Thanksgiving\nDay, with the November meeting of the Corn Cob Club scheduled for that\nevening, but Mrs. Mifflin had promised to get home from Boston in time\nto bake a chocolate cake for the booksellers.  It was said that some of\nthe members of the club were faithful in attendance more by reason of\nMrs. Mifflin's chocolate cake, and the cask of cider that her brother\nAndrew McGill sent down from the Sabine Farm every autumn, than on\naccount of the bookish conversation.\n\nRoger spent the morning in doing a little housecleaning, in preparation\nfor his wife's return.  He was a trifle abashed to find how many\nmingled crumbs and tobacco cinders had accumulated on the dining-room\nrug.  He cooked himself a modest lunch of lamb chops and baked\npotatoes, and was pleased by an epigram concerning food that came into\nhis mind.  \"It's not the food you dream about that matters,\" he said to\nhimself; \"it's the vittles that walk right in and become a member of\nthe family.\" He felt that this needed a little polishing and\nrephrasing, but that there was a germ of wit in it.  He had a habit of\nencountering ideas at his solitary meals.\n\nAfter this, he was busy at the sink scrubbing the dishes, when he was\nsurprised by feeling two very competent arms surround him, and a pink\ngingham apron was thrown over his head.  \"Mifflin,\" said his wife, \"how\nmany times have I told you to put on an apron when you wash up!\"\n\nThey greeted each other with the hearty, affectionate simplicity of\nthose congenially wedded in middle age.  Helen Mifflin was a buxom,\nhealthy creature, rich in good sense and good humour, well nourished\nboth in mind and body.  She kissed Roger's bald head, tied the apron\naround his shrimpish person, and sat down on a kitchen chair to watch\nhim finish wiping the china.  Her cheeks were cool and ruddy from the\nkeen air, her face lit with the tranquil satisfaction of those who have\nsojourned in the comfortable city of Boston.\n\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Roger, \"this makes it a real Thanksgiving.  You\nlook as plump and full of matter as The Home Book of Verse.\"\n\n\"I've had a stunning time,\" she said, patting Bock who stood at her\nknee, imbibing the familiar and mysterious fragrance by which dogs\nidentify their human friends.  \"I haven't even heard of a book for\nthree weeks.  I did stop in at the Old Angle Book Shop yesterday, just\nto say hullo to Joe Jillings.  He says all booksellers are crazy, but\nthat you are the craziest of the lot.  He wants to know if you're\nbankrupt yet.\"\n\nRoger's slate-blue eyes twinkled.  He hung up a cup in the china closet\nand lit his pipe before replying.\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"I said that our shop was haunted, and mustn't be supposed to come\nunder the usual conditions of the trade.\"\n\n\"Bully for you!  And what did Joe say to that?\"\n\n\"'Haunted by the nuts!'\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Roger, \"when literature goes bankrupt I'm willing to go\nwith it.  Not till then.  But by the way, we're going to be haunted by\na beauteous damsel pretty soon.  You remember my telling you that Mr.\nChapman wants to send his daughter to work in the shop?  Well, here's a\nletter I had from him this morning.\"\n\nHe rummaged in his pocket, and produced the following, which Mrs.\nMifflin read:\n\n\nDEAR MR.  MIFFLIN,\n\nI am so delighted that you and Mrs. Mifflin are willing to try the\nexperiment of taking my daughter as an apprentice.  Titania is really a\nvery charming girl, and if only we can get some of the \"finishing\nschool\" nonsense out of her head she will make a fine woman.  She has\nhad (it was my fault, not hers) the disadvantage of being brought up,\nor rather brought down, by having every possible want and whim\ngratified.  Out of kindness for herself and her future husband, if she\nshould have one, I want her to learn a little about earning a living.\nShe is nearly nineteen, and I told her if she would try the bookshop\njob for a while I would take her to Europe for a year afterward.\n\nAs I explained to you, I want her to think she is really earning her\nway.  Of course I don't want the routine to be too hard for her, but I\ndo want her to get some idea of what it means to face life on one's\nown.  If you will pay her ten dollars a week as a beginner, and deduct\nher board from that, I will pay you twenty dollars a week, privately,\nfor your responsibility in caring for her and keeping your and Mrs.\nMifflin's friendly eyes on her.  I'm coming round to the Corn Cob\nmeeting to-morrow night, and we can make the final arrangements.\n\nLuckily, she is very fond of books, and I really think she is looking\nforward to the adventure with much anticipation.  I overheard her\nsaying to one of her friends yesterday that she was going to do some\n\"literary work\" this winter.  That's the kind of nonsense I want her to\noutgrow.  When I hear her say that she's got a job in a bookstore, I'll\nknow she's cured.\n\n                                   Cordially yours,\n                                         GEORGE CHAPMAN.\n\n\n\"Well?\" said Roger, as Mrs. Mifflin made no comment.  \"Don't you think\nit will be rather interesting to get a naive young girl's reactions\ntoward the problems of our tranquil existence?\"\n\n\"Roger, you blessed innocent!\" cried his wife.  \"Life will no longer be\ntranquil with a girl of nineteen round the place.  You may fool\nyourself, but you can't fool me.  A girl of nineteen doesn't REACT\ntoward things.  She explodes.  Things don't 'react' anywhere but in\nBoston and in chemical laboratories.  I suppose you know you're taking\na human bombshell into the arsenal?\"\n\nRoger looked dubious.  \"I remember something in Weir of Hermiston about\na girl being 'an explosive engine,'\" he said.  \"But I don't see that\nshe can do any very great harm round here.  We're both pretty well\nproof against shell shock.  The worst that could happen would be if she\ngot hold of my private copy of Fireside Conversation in the Age of\nQueen Elizabeth.  Remind me to lock it up somewhere, will you?\"\n\nThis secret masterpiece by Mark Twain was one of the bookseller's\ntreasures.  Not even Helen had ever been permitted to read it; and she\nhad shrewdly judged that it was not in her line, for though she knew\nperfectly well where he kept it (together with his life insurance\npolicy, some Liberty Bonds, an autograph letter from Charles Spencer\nChaplin, and a snapshot of herself taken on their honeymoon) she had\nnever made any attempt to examine it.\n\n\"Well,\" said Helen; \"Titania or no Titania, if the Corn Cobs want their\nchocolate cake to-night, I must get busy.  Take my suitcase upstairs\nlike a good fellow.\"\n\n\nA gathering of booksellers is a pleasant sanhedrim to attend.  The\nmembers of this ancient craft bear mannerisms and earmarks just as\ndefinitely recognizable as those of the cloak and suit business or any\nother trade.  They are likely to be a little--shall we say--worn at the\nbindings, as becomes men who have forsaken worldly profit to pursue a\nnoble calling ill rewarded in cash.  They are possibly a trifle\nembittered, which is an excellent demeanour for mankind in the face of\ninscrutable heaven.  Long experience with publishers' salesmen makes\nthem suspicious of books praised between the courses of a heavy meal.\n\nWhen a publisher's salesman takes you out to dinner, it is not\nsurprising if the conversation turns toward literature about the time\nthe last of the peas are being harried about the plate.  But, as Jerry\nGladfist says (he runs a shop up on Thirty-Eighth Street) the\npublishers' salesmen supply a long-felt want, for they do now and then\nbuy one a dinner the like of which no bookseller would otherwise be\nlikely to commit.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" said Roger as his guests assembled in his little\ncabinet, \"it's a cold evening.  Pull up toward the fire.  Make free\nwith the cider.  The cake's on the table.  My wife came back from\nBoston specially to make it.\"\n\n\"Here's Mrs. Mifflin's health!\" said Mr. Chapman, a quiet little man\nwho had a habit of listening to what he heard.  \"I hope she doesn't\nmind keeping the shop while we celebrate?\"\n\n\"Not a bit,\" said Roger.  \"She enjoys it.\"\n\n\"I see Tarzan of the Apes is running at the Gissing Street movie\npalace,\" said Gladfist.  \"Great stuff.  Have you seen it?\"\n\n\"Not while I can still read The Jungle Book,\" said Roger.\n\n\"You make me tired with that talk about literature,\" cried Jerry.  \"A\nbook's a book, even if Harold Bell Wright wrote it.\"\n\n\"A book's a book if you enjoy reading it,\" amended Meredith, from a big\nFifth Avenue bookstore.  \"Lots of people enjoy Harold Bell Wright just\nas lots of people enjoy tripe.  Either of them would kill me.  But\nlet's be tolerant.\"\n\n\"Your argument is a whole succession of non sequiturs,\" said Jerry,\nstimulated by the cider to unusual brilliance.\n\n\"That's a long putt,\" chuckled Benson, the dealer in rare books and\nfirst editions.\n\n\"What I mean is this,\" said Jerry.  \"We aren't literary critics.  It's\nnone of our business to say what's good and what isn't.  Our job is\nsimply to supply the public with the books it wants when it wants them.\nHow it comes to want the books it does is no concern of ours.\"\n\n\"You're the guy that calls bookselling the worst business in the\nworld,\" said Roger warmly, \"and you're the kind of guy that makes it\nso.  I suppose you would say that it is no concern of the bookseller to\ntry to increase the public appetite for books?\"\n\n\"Appetite is too strong a word,\" said Jerry.  \"As far as books are\nconcerned the public is barely able to sit up and take a little liquid\nnourishment.  Solid foods don't interest it.  If you try to cram roast\nbeef down the gullet of an invalid you'll kill him.  Let the public\nalone, and thank God when it comes round to amputate any of its\nhard-earned cash.\"\n\n\"Well, take it on the lowest basis,\" said Roger.  \"I haven't any facts\nto go upon----\"\n\n\"You never have,\" interjected Jerry.\n\n\"But I'd like to bet that the Trade has made more money out of Bryce's\nAmerican Commonwealth than it ever did out of all Parson Wright's books\nput together.\"\n\n\"What of it?  Why shouldn't they make both?\"\n\nThis preliminary tilt was interrupted by the arrival of two more\nvisitors, and Roger handed round mugs of cider, pointed to the cake and\nthe basket of pretzels, and lit his corn-cob pipe.  The new arrivals\nwere Quincy and Fruehling; the former a clerk in the book department of\na vast drygoods store, the latter the owner of a bookshop in the Hebrew\nquarter of Grand Street--one of the best-stocked shops in the city,\nthough little known to uptown book-lovers.\n\n\"Well,\" said Fruehling, his bright dark eyes sparkling above richly\ntinted cheek-bones and bushy beard, \"what's the argument?\"\n\n\"The usual one,\" said Gladfist, grinning, \"Mifflin confusing\nmerchandise with metaphysics.\"\n\nMIFFLIN--Not at all.  I am simply saying that it is good business to\nsell only the best.\n\nGLADFIST--Wrong again.  You must select your stock according to your\ncustomers.  Ask Quincy here.  Would there be any sense in his loading\nup his shelves with Maeterlinck and Shaw when the department-store\ntrade wants Eleanor Porter and the Tarzan stuff?  Does a country grocer\ncarry the same cigars that are listed on the wine card of a Fifth\nAvenue hotel?  Of course not.  He gets in the cigars that his trade\nenjoys and is accustomed to.  Bookselling must obey the ordinary rules\nof commerce.\n\nMIFFLIN--A fig for the ordinary rules of commerce!  I came over here to\nGissing Street to get away from them.  My mind would blow out its fuses\nif I had to abide by the dirty little considerations of supply and\ndemand.  As far as I am concerned, supply CREATES demand.\n\nGLADFIST--Still, old chap, you have to abide by the dirty little\nconsideration of earning a living, unless someone has endowed you?\n\nBENSON--Of course my line of business isn't strictly the same as you\nfellows'.  But a thought that has often occurred to me in selling rare\neditions may interest you.  The customer's willingness to part with his\nmoney is usually in inverse ratio to the permanent benefit he expects\nto derive from what he purchases.\n\nMEREDITH--Sounds a bit like John Stuart Mill.\n\nBENSON--Even so, it may be true.  Folks will pay a darned sight more to\nbe amused than they will to be exalted.  Look at the way a man shells\nout five bones for a couple of theatre seats, or spends a couple of\ndollars a week on cigars without thinking of it.  Yet two dollars or\nfive dollars for a book costs him positive anguish.  The mistake you\nfellows in the retail trade have made is in trying to persuade your\ncustomers that books are necessities.  Tell them they're luxuries.\nThat'll get them!  People have to work so hard in this life they're shy\nof necessities.  A man will go on wearing a suit until it's threadbare,\nmuch sooner than smoke a threadbare cigar.\n\nGLADFIST--Not a bad thought.  You know, Mifflin here calls me a\nmaterial-minded cynic, but by thunder, I think I'm more idealistic than\nhe is.  I'm no propagandist incessantly trying to cajole poor innocent\ncustomers into buying the kind of book _I_ think they ought to buy.\nWhen I see the helpless pathos of most of them, who drift into a\nbookstore without the slightest idea of what they want or what is worth\nreading, I would disdain to take advantage of their frailty.  They are\nabsolutely at the mercy of the salesman.  They will buy whatever he\ntells them to.  Now the honourable man, the high-minded man (by which I\nmean myself) is too proud to ram some shimmering stuff at them just\nbecause he thinks they ought to read it.  Let the boobs blunder around\nand grab what they can.  Let natural selection operate.  I think it is\nfascinating to watch them, to see their helpless groping, and to study\nthe weird ways in which they make their choice.  Usually they will buy\na book either because they think the jacket is attractive, or because\nit costs a dollar and a quarter instead of a dollar and a half, or\nbecause they say they saw a review of it.  The \"review\" usually turns\nout to be an ad.  I don't think one book-buyer in a thousand knows the\ndifference.\n\nMIFFLIN--Your doctrine is pitiless, base, and false!  What would you\nthink of a physician who saw men suffering from a curable disease and\ndid nothing to alleviate their sufferings?\n\nGLADFIST--Their sufferings (as you call them) are nothing to what mine\nwould be if I stocked up with a lot of books that no one but highbrows\nwould buy.  What would you think of a base public that would go past my\nshop day after day and let the high-minded occupant die of starvation?\n\nMIFFLIN--Your ailment, Jerry, is that you conceive yourself as merely a\ntradesman.  What I'm telling you is that the bookseller is a public\nservant.  He ought to be pensioned by the state.  The honour of his\nprofession should compel him to do all he can to spread the\ndistribution of good stuff.\n\nQUINCY--I think you forget how much we who deal chiefly in new books\nare at the mercy of the publishers.  We have to stock the new stuff, a\nlarge proportion of which is always punk.  Why it is punk, goodness\nknows, because most of the bum books don't sell.\n\nMIFFLIN--Ah, that is a mystery indeed!  But I can give you a fair\nreason.  First, because there isn't enough good stuff to go round.\nSecond, because of the ignorance of the publishers, many of whom\nhonestly don't know a good book when they see it.  It is a matter of\nsheer heedlessness in the selection of what they intend to publish.  A\nbig drug factory or a manufacturer of a well-known jam spends vast sums\nof money on chemically assaying and analyzing the ingredients that are\nto go into his medicines or in gathering and selecting the fruit that\nis to be stewed into jam.  And yet they tell me that the most important\ndepartment of a publishing business, which is the gathering and\nsampling of manuscripts, is the least considered and the least\nremunerated.  I knew a reader for one publishing house:  he was a babe\nrecently out of college who didn't know a book from a frat pin.  If a\njam factory employs a trained chemist, why isn't it worth a publisher's\nwhile to employ an expert book analyzer?  There are some of them.  Look\nat the fellow who runs the Pacific Monthly's book business for example!\nHe knows a thing or two.\n\nCHAPMAN--I think perhaps you exaggerate the value of those trained\nexperts.  They are likely to be fourflushers.  We had one once at our\nfactory, and as far as I could make out he never thought we were doing\ngood business except when we were losing money.\n\nMIFFLIN--As far as I have been able to observe, making money is the\neasiest thing in the world.  All you have to do is to turn out an\nhonest product, something that the public needs.  Then you have to let\nthem know that you have it, and teach them that they need it.  They\nwill batter down your front door in their eagerness to get it.  But if\nyou begin to hand them gold bricks, if you begin to sell them books\nbuilt like an apartment house, all marble front and all brick behind,\nyou're cutting your own throat, or rather cutting your own pocket,\nwhich is the same thing.\n\nMEREDITH--I think Mifflin's right.  You know the kind of place our shop\nis:  a regular Fifth Avenue store, all plate glass front and marble\ncolumns glowing in the indirect lighting like a birchwood at full moon.\nWe sell hundreds of dollars' worth of bunkum every day because people\nask for it; but I tell you we do it with reluctance.  It's rather the\ncustom in our shop to scoff at the book-buying public and call them\nboobs, but they really want good books--the poor souls don't know how\nto get them.  Still, Jerry has a certain grain of truth to his credit.\nI get ten times more satisfaction in selling a copy of Newton's The\nAmenities of Book-Collecting than I do in selling a copy of--well,\nTarzan; but it's poor business to impose your own private tastes on\nyour customers.  All you can do is to hint them along tactfully, when\nyou get a chance, toward the stuff that counts.\n\nQUINCY--You remind me of something that happened in our book department\nthe other day.  A flapper came in and said she had forgotten the name\nof the book she wanted, but it was something about a young man who had\nbeen brought up by the monks.  I was stumped.  I tried her with The\nCloister and the Hearth and Monastery Bells and Legends of the Monastic\nOrders and so on, but her face was blank.  Then one of the salesgirls\noverheard us talking, and she guessed it right off the bat.  Of course\nit was Tarzan.\n\nMIFFLIN--You poor simp, there was your chance to introduce her to\nMowgli and the bandar-log.\n\nQUINCY--True--I didn't think of it.\n\nMIFFLIN--I'd like to get you fellows' ideas about advertising.  There\nwas a young chap in here the other day from an advertising agency,\ntrying to get me to put some copy in the papers.  Have you found that\nit pays?\n\nFRUEHLING--It always pays--somebody.  The only question is, does it pay\nthe man who pays for the ad?\n\nMEREDITH--What do you mean?\n\nFRUEHLING--Did you ever consider the problem of what I call tangential\nadvertising?  By that I mean advertising that benefits your rival\nrather than yourself?  Take an example.  On Sixth Avenue there is a\nlovely delicatessen shop, but rather expensive.  Every conceivable kind\nof sweetmeat and relish is displayed in the brightly lit window.  When\nyou look at that window it simply makes your mouth water.  You decide\nto have something to eat.  But do you get it there?  Not much!  You go\na little farther down the street and get it at the Automat or the\nCrystal Lunch.  The delicatessen fellow pays the overhead expense of\nthat beautiful food exhibit, and the other man gets the benefit of it.\nIt's the same way in my business.  I'm in a factory district, where\npeople can't afford to have any but the best books.  (Meredith will\nbear me out in saying that only the wealthy can afford the poor ones.)\nThey read the book ads in the papers and magazines, the ads of\nMeredith's shop and others, and then they come to me to buy them.  I\nbelieve in advertising, but I believe in letting someone else pay for\nit.\n\nMIFFLIN--I guess perhaps I can afford to go on riding on Meredith's\nads.  I hadn't thought of that.  But I think I shall put a little\nnotice in one of the papers some day, just a little card saying\n\n\n                         PARNASSUS AT HOME\n                         GOOD BOOKS BOUGHT\n                             AND SOLD\n                       THIS SHOP IS HAUNTED\n\n\nIt will be fun to see what come-back I get.\n\nQUINCY--The book section of a department store doesn't get much chance\nto enjoy that tangential advertising, as Fruehling calls it.  Why, when\nour interior decorating shark puts a few volumes of a pirated Kipling\nbound in crushed oilcloth or a copy of \"Knock-kneed Stories,\" into the\nwindow to show off a Louis XVIII boudoir suite, display space is\ncharged up against my department!  Last summer he asked me for\n\"something by that Ring fellow, I forget the name,\" to put a punchy\nfinish on a layout of porch furniture.  I thought perhaps he meant\nWagner's Nibelungen operas, and began to dig them out.  Then I found he\nmeant Ring Lardner.\n\nGLADFIST--There you are.  I keep telling you bookselling is an\nimpossible job for a man who loves literature.  When did a bookseller\never make any real contribution to the world's happiness?\n\nMIFFLIN--Dr. Johnson's father was a bookseller.\n\nGLADFIST--Yes, and couldn't afford to pay for Sam's education.\n\nFRUEHLING--There's another kind of tangential advertising that\ninterests me.  Take, for instance, a Coles Phillips painting for some\nbrand of silk stockings.  Of course the high lights of the picture are\ncunningly focussed on the stockings of the eminently beautiful lady;\nbut there is always something else in the picture--an automobile or a\ncountry house or a Morris chair or a parasol--which makes it just as\neffective an ad for those goods as it is for the stockings.  Every now\nand then Phillips sticks a book into his paintings, and I expect the\nFifth Avenue book trade benefits by it.  A book that fits the mind as\nwell as a silk stocking does the ankle will be sure to sell.\n\nMIFFLIN--You are all crass materialists.  I tell you, books are the\ndepositories of the human spirit, which is the only thing in this world\nthat endures.  What was it Shakespeare said--\n\n\n     Not marble nor the gilded monuments\n     Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme--\n\n\nBy the bones of the Hohenzollerns, he was right!  And wait a minute!\nThere's something in Carlyle's Cromwell that comes back to me.\n\nHe ran excitedly out of the room, and the members of the Corn Cob\nfraternity grinned at each other.  Gladfist cleaned his pipe and poured\nout some more cider.  \"He's off on his hobby,\" he chuckled.  \"I love\nbaiting him.\"\n\n\"Speaking of Carlyle's Cromwell,\" said Fruehling, \"that's a book I\ndon't often hear asked for.  But a fellow came in the other day hunting\nfor a copy, and to my chagrin I didn't have one.  I rather pride myself\non keeping that sort of thing in stock.  So I called up Brentano's to\nsee if I could pick one up, and they told me they had just sold the\nonly copy they had.  Somebody must have been boosting Thomas!  Maybe\nhe's quoted in Tarzan, or somebody has bought up the film rights.\"\n\nMifflin came in, looking rather annoyed.\n\n\"Here's an odd thing,\" he said.  \"I know damn well that copy of\nCromwell was on the shelf because I saw it there last night.  It's not\nthere now.\"\n\n\"That's nothing,\" said Quincy.  \"You know how people come into a\nsecond-hand store, see a book they take a fancy to but don't feel like\nbuying just then, and tuck it away out of sight or on some other shelf\nwhere they think no one else will spot it, but they'll be able to find\nit when they can afford it.  Probably someone's done that with your\nCromwell.\"\n\n\"Maybe, but I doubt it,\" said Mifflin.  \"Mrs. Mifflin says she didn't\nsell it this evening.  I woke her up to ask her.  She was dozing over\nher knitting at the desk.  I guess she's tired after her trip.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry to miss the Carlyle quotation,\" said Benson.  \"What was the\ngist?\"\n\n\"I think I've got it jotted down in a notebook,\" said Roger, hunting\nalong a shelf.  \"Yes, here it is.\"  He read aloud:\n\n\n\"The works of a man, bury them under what guano-mountains and obscene\nowl-droppings you will, do not perish, cannot perish.  What of Heroism,\nwhat of Eternal Light was in a Man and his Life, is with very great\nexactness added to the Eternities, remains forever a new divine portion\nof the Sum of Things.\n\n\n\"Now, my friends, the bookseller is one of the keys in that universal\nadding machine, because he aids in the cross-fertilization of men and\nbooks.  His delight in his calling doesn't need to be stimulated even\nby the bright shanks of a Coles Phillips picture.\n\n\"Roger, my boy,\" said Gladfist, \"your innocent enthusiasm makes me\nthink of Tom Daly's favourite story about the Irish priest who was\nrebuking his flock for their love of whisky.  'Whisky,' he said, 'is\nthe bane of this congregation.  Whisky, that steals away a man's\nbrains.  Whisky, that makes you shoot at landlords--and not hit them!'\nEven so, my dear Roger, your enthusiasm makes you shoot at truth and\nnever come anywhere near it.\"\n\n\"Jerry,\" said Roger, \"you are a upas tree.  Your shadow is poisonous!\"\n\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" said Mr. Chapman, \"I know Mrs. Mifflin wants to be\nrelieved of her post.  I vote we adjourn early.  Your conversation is\nalways delightful, though I am sometimes a bit uncertain as to the\nconclusions.  My daughter is going to be a bookseller, and I shall look\nforward to hearing her views on the business.\"\n\nAs the guests made their way out through the shop, Mr. Chapman drew\nRoger aside.  \"It's perfectly all right about sending Titania?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" said Roger.  \"When does she want to come?\"\n\n\"Is to-morrow too soon?\"\n\n\"The sooner the better.  We've got a little spare room upstairs that\nshe can have.  I've got some ideas of my own about furnishing it for\nher.  Send her round to-morrow afternoon.\"\n\n\n\nChapter III\n\nTitania Arrives\n\n\nThe first pipe after breakfast is a rite of some importance to seasoned\nsmokers, and Roger applied the flame to the bowl as he stood at the\nbottom of the stairs.  He blew a great gush of strong blue reek that\neddied behind him as he ran up the flight, his mind eagerly meditating\nthe congenial task of arranging the little spare room for the coming\nemployee.  Then, at the top of the steps, he found that his pipe had\nalready gone out.  \"What with filling my pipe and emptying it, lighting\nit and relighting it,\" he thought, \"I don't seem to get much time for\nthe serious concerns of life.  Come to think of it, smoking, soiling\ndishes and washing them, talking and listening to other people talk,\ntake up most of life anyway.\"\n\nThis theory rather pleased him, so he ran downstairs again to tell it\nto Mrs. Mifflin.\n\n\"Go along and get that room fixed up,\" she said, \"and don't try to palm\noff any bogus doctrines on me so early in the morning.  Housewives have\nno time for philosophy after breakfast.\"\n\nRoger thoroughly enjoyed himself in the task of preparing the\nguest-room for the new assistant.  It was a small chamber at the back\nof the second storey, opening on to a narrow passage that connected\nthrough a door with the gallery of the bookshop.  Two small windows\ncommanded a view of the modest roofs of that quarter of Brooklyn, roofs\nthat conceal so many brave hearts, so many baby carriages, so many cups\nof bad coffee, and so many cartons of the Chapman prunes.\n\n\"By the way,\" he called downstairs, \"better have some of the prunes for\nsupper to-night, just as a compliment to Miss Chapman.\"\n\nMrs. Mifflin preserved a humorous silence.\n\nOver these noncommittal summits the bright eye of the bookseller, as he\ntacked up the freshly ironed muslin curtains Mrs. Mifflin had allotted,\ncould discern a glimpse of the bay and the leviathan ferries that link\nStaten Island with civilization.  \"Just a touch of romance in the\noutlook,\" he thought to himself.  \"It will suffice to keep a blasee\nyoung girl aware of the excitements of existence.\"\n\nThe room, as might be expected in a house presided over by Helen\nMifflin, was in perfect order to receive any occupant, but Roger had\nvolunteered to psychologize it in such a fashion as (he thought) would\nconvey favourable influences to the misguided young spirit that was to\nbe its tenant.  Incurable idealist, he had taken quite gravely his\nresponsibility as landlord and employer of Mr. Chapman's daughter.  No\nchambered nautilus was to have better opportunity to expand the tender\nmansions of its soul.\n\nBeside the bed was a bookshelf with a reading lamp.  The problem Roger\nwas discussing was what books and pictures might be the best preachers\nto this congregation of one.  To Mrs. Mifflin's secret amusement he had\ntaken down the picture of Sir Galahad which he had once hung there,\nbecause (as he had said) if Sir Galahad were living to-day he would be\na bookseller.  \"We don't want her feasting her imagination on young\nGalahads,\" he had remarked at breakfast.  \"That way lies premature\nmatrimony.  What I want to do is put up in her room one or two good\nprints representing actual men who were so delightful in their day that\nall the young men she is likely to see now will seem tepid and\nprehensile.  Thus she will become disgusted with the present generation\nof youths and there will be some chance of her really putting her mind\non the book business.\"\n\nAccordingly he had spent some time in going through a bin where he kept\nphotos and drawings of authors that the publishers' \"publicity men\"\nwere always showering upon him.  After some thought he discarded\npromising engravings of Harold Bell Wright and Stephen Leacock, and\nchose pictures of Shelley, Anthony Trollope, Robert Louis Stevenson,\nand Robert Burns.  Then, after further meditation, he decided that\nneither Shelley nor Burns would quite do for a young girl's room, and\nset them aside in favour of a portrait of Samuel Butler.  To these he\nadded a framed text that he was very fond of and had hung over his own\ndesk.  He had once clipped it from a copy of Life and found much\npleasure in it.  It runs thus:\n\n\n                    ON THE RETURN OF A BOOK\n                       LENT TO A FRIEND\n\n\nI GIVE humble and hearty thanks for the safe return of this book which\nhaving endured the perils of my friend's bookcase, and the bookcases of\nmy friend's friends, now returns to me in reasonably good condition.\n\nI GIVE humble and hearty thanks that my friend did not see fit to give\nthis book to his infant as a plaything, nor use it as an ash-tray for\nhis burning cigar, nor as a teething-ring for his mastiff.\n\nWHEN I lent this book I deemed it as lost:  I was resigned to the\nbitterness of the long parting:  I never thought to look upon its pages\nagain.\n\nBUT NOW that my book is come back to me, I rejoice and am exceeding\nglad!  Bring hither the fatted morocco and let us rebind the volume and\nset it on the shelf of honour:  for this my book was lent, and is\nreturned again.\n\nPRESENTLY, therefore, I may return some of the books that I myself have\nborrowed.\n\n\n\"There!\" he thought.  \"That will convey to her the first element of\nbook morality.\"\n\nThese decorations having been displayed on the walls, he bethought\nhimself of the books that should stand on the bedside shelf.\n\nThis is a question that admits of the utmost nicety of discussion.\nSome authorities hold that the proper books for a guest-room are of a\nsoporific quality that will induce swift and painless repose.  This\nschool advises The Wealth of Nations, Rome under the Caesars, The\nStatesman's Year Book, certain novels of Henry James, and The Letters\nof Queen Victoria (in three volumes).  It is plausibly contended that\nbooks of this kind cannot be read (late at night) for more than a few\nminutes at a time, and that they afford useful scraps of information.\n\nAnother branch of opinion recommends for bedtime reading short stories,\nvolumes of pithy anecdote, swift and sparkling stuff that may keep one\nawake for a space, yet will advantage all the sweeter slumber in the\nend.  Even ghost stories and harrowing matter are maintained seasonable\nby these pundits.  This class of reading comprises O. Henry, Bret\nHarte, Leonard Merrick, Ambrose Bierce, W. W. Jacobs, Daudet, de\nMaupassant, and possibly even On a Slow Train Through Arkansaw, that\ngrievous classic of the railway bookstalls whereof its author, Mr.\nThomas W. Jackson, has said \"It will sell forever, and a thousand years\nafterward.\" To this might be added another of Mr. Jackson's onslaughts\non the human intelligence, I'm From Texas, You Can't Steer Me, whereof\nis said (by the author) \"It is like a hard-boiled egg, you can't beat\nit.\" There are other of Mr. Jackson's books, whose titles escape\nmemory, whereof he has said \"They are a dynamite for sorrow.\" Nothing\nused to annoy Mifflin more than to have someone come in and ask for\ncopies of these works.  His brother-in-law, Andrew McGill, the writer,\nonce gave him for Christmas (just to annoy him) a copy of On a Slow\nTrain Through Arkansaw sumptuously bound and gilded in what is known to\nthe trade as \"dove-coloured ooze.\" Roger retorted by sending Andrew\n(for his next birthday) two volumes of Brann the Iconoclast bound in\nwhat Robert Cortes Holliday calls \"embossed toadskin.\"  But that is\napart from the story.\n\nTo the consideration of what to put on Miss Titania's bookshelf Roger\ndevoted the delighted hours of the morning.  Several times Helen called\nhim to come down and attend to the shop, but he was sitting on the\nfloor, unaware of numbed shins, poring over the volumes he had carted\nupstairs for a final culling.  \"It will be a great privilege,\" he said\nto himself, \"to have a young mind to experiment with.  Now my wife,\ndelightful creature though she is, was--well, distinctly mature when I\nhad the good fortune to meet her; I have never been able properly to\nsupervise her mental processes.  But this Chapman girl will come to us\nwholly unlettered.  Her father said she had been to a fashionable\nschool:  that surely is a guarantee that the delicate tendrils of her\nmind have never begun to sprout.  I will test her (without her knowing\nit) by the books I put here for her.  By noting which of them she\nresponds to, I will know how to proceed.  It might be worth while to\nshut up the shop one day a week in order to give her some brief talks\non literature.  Delightful!  Let me see, a little series of talks on\nthe development of the English novel, beginning with Tom Jones--hum,\nthat would hardly do!  Well, I have always longed to be a teacher, this\nlooks like a chance to begin.  We might invite some of the neighbours\nto send in their children once a week, and start a little school.\nCauseries du lundi, in fact!  Who knows I may yet be the Sainte Beuve\nof Brooklyn.\"\n\nAcross his mind flashed a vision of newspaper clippings--\"This\nremarkable student of letters, who hides his brilliant parts under the\nunassuming existence of a second-hand bookseller, is now recognized as\nthe----\"\n\n\"Roger!\" called Mrs. Mifflin from downstairs:  \"Front! someone wants to\nknow if you keep back numbers of Foamy Stories.\"\n\nAfter he had thrown out the intruder, Roger returned to his meditation.\n\"This selection,\" he mused, \"is of course only tentative.  It is to act\nas a preliminary test, to see what sort of thing interests her.  First\nof all, her name naturally suggests Shakespeare and the Elizabethans.\nIt's a remarkable name, Titania Chapman: there must be great virtue in\nprunes!  Let's begin with a volume of Christopher Marlowe.  Then Keats,\nI guess:  every young person ought to shiver over St. Agnes' Eve on a\nbright cold winter evening.  Over Bemerton's, certainly, because it's a\nbookshop story.  Eugene Field's Tribune Primer to try out her sense of\nhumour.  And Archy, by all means, for the same reason.  I'll go down\nand get the Archy scrapbook.\"\n\nIt should be explained that Roger was a keen admirer of Don Marquis,\nthe humourist of the New York Evening Sun.  Mr. Marquis once lived in\nBrooklyn, and the bookseller was never tired of saying that he was the\nmost eminent author who had graced the borough since the days of Walt\nWhitman.  Archy, the imaginary cockroach whom Mr. Marquis uses as a\nvehicle for so much excellent fun, was a constant delight to Roger, and\nhe had kept a scrapbook of all Archy's clippings.  This bulky tome he\nnow brought out from the grotto by his desk where his particular\ntreasures were kept.  He ran his eye over it, and Mrs. Mifflin heard\nhim utter shrill screams of laughter.\n\n\"What on earth is it?\" she asked.\n\n\"Only Archy,\" he said, and began to read aloud--\n\n     down in a wine vault underneath the city\n       two old men were sitting they were drinking booze\n     torn were their garments hair and beards were gritty\n       one had an overcoat but hardly any shoes\n\n     overhead the street cars through the streets were running\n       filled with happy people going home to christmas\n     in the adirondacks the hunters all were gunning\n       big ships were sailing down by the isthmus\n\n     in came a little tot for to kiss her granny\n       such a little totty she could scarcely tottle\n     saying kiss me grandpa kiss your little nanny\n       but the old man beaned her with a whisky bottle.\n\n     outside the snowflakes began for to flutter\n       far at sea the ships were sailing with the seamen\n     not another word did angel nanny utter\n       her grandsire chuckled and pledged the whisky demon\n\n     up spake the second man he was worn and weary\n       tears washed his face which otherwise was pasty\n     she loved her parents who commuted on the erie\n       brother im afraid you struck a trifle hasty\n\n     she came to see you all her pretty duds on\n       bringing christmas posies from her mothers garden\n     riding in the tunnel underneath the hudson\n       brother was it rum caused your heart to harden----\n\n\"What on earth is there funny in that?\" said Mrs. Mifflin.  \"Poor\nlittle lamb, I think it was terrible.\"\n\n\"There's more of it,\" cried Roger, and opened his mouth to continue.\n\n\"No more, thank you,\" said Helen.  \"There ought to be a fine for using\nthe meter of Love in the Valley that way.  I'm going out to market so\nif the bell rings you'll have to answer it.\"\n\nRoger added the Archy scrapbook to Miss Titania's shelf, and went on\nbrowsing over the volumes he had collected.\n\n\"The Nigger of the Narcissus,\" he said to himself, \"for even if she\ndoesn't read the story perhaps she'll read the preface, which not\nmarble nor the monuments of princes will outlive.  Dickens' Christmas\nStories to introduce her to Mrs. Lirriper, the queen of landladies.\nPublishers tell me that Norfolk Street, Strand, is best known for the\nfamous literary agent that has his office there, but I wonder how many\nof them know that that was where Mrs. Lirriper had her immortal\nlodgings?  The Notebooks of Samuel Butler, just to give her a little\nintellectual jazz.  The Wrong Box, because it's the best farce in the\nlanguage.  Travels with a Donkey, to show her what good writing is\nlike.  The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse to give her a sense of pity\nfor human woes--wait a minute, though:  that's a pretty broad book for\nyoung ladies.  I guess we'll put it aside and see what else there is.\nSome of Mr. Mosher's catalogues:  fine! they'll show her the true\nspirit of what one book-lover calls biblio-bliss.  Walking-Stick\nPapers--yes, there are still good essayists running around.  A bound\nfile of The Publishers' Weekly to give her a smack of trade matters.\nJo's Boys in case she needs a little relaxation.  The Lays of Ancient\nRome and Austin Dobson to show her some good poetry.  I wonder if they\ngive them The Lays to read in school nowadays?  I have a horrible fear\nthey are brought up on the battle of Salamis and the brutal redcoats of\n'76.  And now we'll be exceptionally subtle: we'll stick in a Robert\nChambers to see if she falls for it.\"\n\nHe viewed the shelf with pride.  \"Not bad,\" he said to himself.  \"I'll\njust add this Leonard Merrick, Whispers about Women, to amuse her.  I\nbet that title will start her guessing.  Helen will say I ought to have\nincluded the Bible, but I'll omit it on purpose, just to see whether\nthe girl misses it.\"\n\nWith typical male curiosity he pulled out the bureau drawers to see\nwhat disposition his wife had made of them, and was pleased to find a\nlittle muslin bag of lavender dispersing a quiet fragrance in each.\n\"Very nice,\" he remarked.  \"Very nice indeed!  About the only thing\nmissing is an ashtray.  If Miss Titania is as modern as some of them,\nthat'll be the first thing she'll call for.  And maybe a copy of Ezra\nPound's poems.  I do hope she's not what Helen calls a bolshevixen.\"\n\n\nThere was nothing bolshevik about a glittering limousine that drew up\nat the corner of Gissing and Swinburne streets early that afternoon.  A\nchauffeur in green livery opened the door, lifted out a suitcase of\nbeautiful brown leather, and gave a respectful hand to the vision that\nemerged from depths of lilac-coloured upholstery.\n\n\"Where do you want me to carry the bag, miss?\"\n\n\"This is the bitter parting,\" replied Miss Titania.  \"I don't want you\nto know my address, Edwards.  Some of my mad friends might worm it out\nof you, and I don't want them coming down and bothering me.  I am going\nto be very busy with literature.  I'll walk the rest of the way.\"\n\nEdwards saluted with a grin--he worshipped the original young\nheiress--and returned to his wheel.\n\n\"There's one thing I want you to do for me,\" said Titania.  \"Call up my\nfather and tell him I'm on the job.\"\n\n\"Yes, miss,\" said Edwards, who would have run the limousine into a\ngovernment motor truck if she had ordered it.\n\nMiss Chapman's small gloved hand descended into an interesting purse\nthat was cuffed to her wrist with a bright little chain.  She drew out\na nickel--it was characteristic of her that it was a very bright and\nengaging looking nickel--and handed it gravely to her charioteer.\nEqually gravely he saluted, and the car, after moving through certain\ndignified arcs, swam swiftly away down Thackeray Boulevard.\n\nTitania, after making sure that Edwards was out of sight, turned up\nGissing Street with a fluent pace and an observant eye.  A small boy\ncried, \"Carry your bag, lady?\" and she was about to agree, but then\nremembered that she was now engaged at ten dollars a week and waved him\naway.  Our readers would feel a justifiable grudge if we did not\nattempt a description of the young lady, and we will employ the few\nblocks of her course along Gissing Street for this purpose.\n\nWalking behind her, the observer, by the time she had reached Clemens\nPlace, would have seen that she was faultlessly tailored in genial\ntweeds; that her small brown boots were sheltered by spats of that pale\ntan complexion exhibited by Pullman porters on the Pennsylvania\nRailroad; that her person was both slender and vigorous; that her\nshoulders were carrying a sumptuous fur of the colour described by the\ntrade as nutria, or possibly opal smoke.  The word chinchilla would\nhave occurred irresistibly to this observer from behind; he might also,\nif he were the father of a family, have had a fleeting vision of many\nautographed stubs in a check book.  The general impression that he\nwould have retained, had he turned aside at Clemens Place, would be\n\"expensive, but worth the expense.\"\n\nIt is more likely, however, that the student of phenomena would have\ncontinued along Gissing Street to the next corner, being that of\nHazlitt Street.  Taking advantage of opportunity, he would overtake the\nlady on the pavement, with a secret, sidelong glance.  If he were wise,\nhe would pass her on the right side where her tilted bonnet permitted a\nwider angle of vision.  He would catch a glimpse of cheek and chin\nbelonging to the category known (and rightly) as adorable; hair that\nheld sunlight through the dullest day; even a small platinum wrist\nwatch that might pardonably be excused, in its exhilarating career, for\nbeating a trifle fast.  Among the greyish furs he would note a bunch of\nsuch violets as never bloom in the crude springtime, but reserve\nthemselves for November and the plate glass windows of Fifth Avenue.\n\nIt is probable that whatever the errand of this spectator he would have\ncontinued along Gissing Street a few paces farther.  Then, with\ncalculated innocence, he would have halted halfway up the block that\nleads to the Wordsworth Avenue \"L,\" and looked backward with carefully\nsimulated irresolution, as though considering some forgotten matter.\nWith apparently unseeing eyes he would have scanned the bright\npedestrian, and caught the full impact of her rich blue gaze.  He would\nhave seen a small resolute face rather vivacious in effect, yet with a\nquaint pathos of youth and eagerness.  He would have noted the cheeks\nlit with excitement and rapid movement in the bracing air.  He would\ncertainly have noted the delicate contrast of the fur of the wild\nnutria with the soft V of her bare throat.  Then, to his surprise, he\nwould have seen this attractive person stop, examine her surroundings,\nand run down some steps into a rather dingy-looking second-hand\nbookshop.  He would have gone about his affairs with a new and\nsurprised conviction that the Almighty had the borough of Brooklyn\nunder His especial care.\n\nRoger, who had conceived a notion of some rather peevish foundling of\nthe Ritz-Carlton lobbies and Central Park riding academies, was\nagreeably amazed by the sweet simplicity of the young lady.\n\n\"Is this Mr. Mifflin?\" she said, as he advanced all agog from his smoky\ncorner.\n\n\"Miss Chapman?\" he replied, taking her bag.  \"Helen!\" he called.  \"Miss\nTitania is here.\"\n\nShe looked about the sombre alcoves of the shop.  \"I do think it's\nadorable of you to take me in,\" she said.  \"Dad has told me so much\nabout you.  He says I'm impossible.  I suppose this is the literature\nhe talks about.  I want to know all about it.\"\n\n\"And here's Bock!\" she cried.  \"Dad says he's the greatest dog in the\nworld, named after Botticelli or somebody.  I've brought him a present.\nIt's in my bag.  Nice old Bocky!\"\n\nBock, who was unaccustomed to spats, was examining them after his own\nfashion.\n\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Mrs. Mifflin.  \"We are delighted to see you.  I\nhope you'll be happy with us, but I rather doubt it.  Mr. Mifflin is a\nhard man to get along with.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure of it!\" cried Titania.  \"I mean, I'm sure I shall be\nhappy!  You mustn't believe a word of what Dad says about me.  I'm\ncrazy about books.  I don't see how you can bear to sell them.  I\nbrought these violets for you, Mrs. Mifflin.\"\n\n\"How perfectly sweet of you,\" said Helen, captivated already.  \"Come\nalong, we'll put them right in water.  I'll show you your room.\"\n\nRoger heard them moving about overhead.  It suddenly occurred to him\nthat the shop was rather a dingy place for a young girl.  \"I wish I had\nthought to get in a cash register,\" he mused.  \"She'll think I'm\nterribly unbusiness-like.\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Mrs. Mifflin, as she and Titania came downstairs again,\n\"I'm making some pastry, so I'm going to turn you over to your\nemployer.  He can show you round the shop and tell you where all the\nbooks are.\"\n\n\"Before we begin,\" said Titania, \"just let me give Bock his present.\"\nShe showed a large package of tissue paper and, unwinding innumerable\nlayers, finally disclosed a stalwart bone.  \"I was lunching at\nSherry's, and I made the head waiter give me this.  He was awfully\namused.\"\n\n\"Come along into the kitchen and give it to him,\" said Helen.  \"He'll\nbe your friend for life.\"\n\n\"What an adorable kennel!\" cried Titania, when she saw the remodelled\npacking-case that served Bock as a retreat.  The bookseller's ingenious\ncarpentry had built it into the similitude of a Carnegie library, with\nthe sign READING-ROOM over the door; and he had painted imitation\nbook-shelves along the interior.\n\n\"You'll get used to Mr. Mifflin after a while,\" said Helen amusedly.\n\"He spent all one winter getting that kennel fixed to his liking.  You\nmight have thought he was going to live in it instead of Bock.  All the\ntitles that he painted in there are books that have dogs in them, and a\nlot of them he made up.\"\n\nTitania insisted on getting down to peer inside.  Bock was much\nflattered at this attention from the new planet that had swum into his\nkennel.\n\n\"Gracious!\" she said, \"here's 'The Rubaiyat of Omar Canine.' I do think\nthat's clever!\"\n\n\"Oh, there are a lot more,\" said Helen.  \"The works of Bonar Law, and\nBohn's 'Classics,' and 'Catechisms on Dogma' and goodness knows what.\nIf Roger paid half as much attention to business as he does to jokes of\nthat sort, we'd be rich.  Now, you run along and have a look at the\nshop.\"\n\nTitania found the bookseller at his desk.  \"Here I am, Mr. Mifflin,\"\nshe said.  \"See, I brought a nice sharp pencil along with me to make\nout sales slips.  I've been practicing sticking it in my hair.  I can\ndo it quite nicely now.  I hope you have some of those big red books\nwith all the carbon paper in them and everything.  I've been watching\nthe girls up at Lord and Taylor's make them out, and I think they're\nfascinating.  And you must teach me to run the elevator.  I'm awfully\nkeen about elevators.\"\n\n\"Bless me,\" said Roger, \"You'll find this very different from Lord and\nTaylor's!  We haven't any elevators, or any sales slips, or even a cash\nregister.  We don't wait on customers unless they ask us to.  They come\nin and browse round, and if they find anything they want they come back\nhere to my desk and ask about it.  The price is marked in every book in\nred pencil.  The cash-box is here on this shelf.  This is the key\nhanging on this little hook.  I enter each sale in this ledger.  When\nyou sell a book you must write it down here, and the price paid for it.\"\n\n\"But suppose it's charged?\" said Titania.\n\n\"No charge accounts.  Everything is cash.  If someone comes in to sell\nbooks, you must refer him to me.  You mustn't be surprised to see\npeople drop in here and spend several hours reading.  Lots of them look\non this as a kind of club.  I hope you don't mind the smell of tobacco,\nfor almost all the men that come here smoke in the shop.  You see, I\nput ash trays around for them.\"\n\n\"I love tobacco smell,\" said Titania.  \"Daddy's library at home smells\nsomething like this, but not quite so strong.  And I want to see the\nworms, bookworms you know.  Daddy said you had lots of them.\"\n\n\"You'll see them, all right,\" said Roger, chuckling.  \"They come in and\nout.  To-morrow I'll show you how my stock is arranged.  It'll take you\nquite a while to get familiar with it.  Until then I just want you to\npoke around and see what there is, until you know the shelves so well\nyou could put your hand on any given book in the dark.  That's a game\nmy wife and I used to play.  We would turn off all the lights at night,\nand I would call out the title of a book and see how near she could\ncome to finding it.  Then I would take a turn.  When we came more than\nsix inches away from it we would have to pay a forfeit.  It's great\nfun.\"\n\n\"What larks we'll have,\" cried Titania.  \"I do think this is a cunning\nplace!\"\n\n\"This is the bulletin board, where I put up notices about books that\ninterest me.  Here's a card I've just been writing.\"\n\nRoger drew from his pocket a square of cardboard and affixed it to the\nboard with a thumbtack.  Titania read:\n\n\n          THE BOOK THAT SHOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE WAR\n\n\nNow that the fighting is over is a good time to read Thomas Hardy's The\nDynasts.  I don't want to sell it, because it is one of the greatest\ntreasures I own.  But if any one will guarantee to read all three\nvolumes, and let them sink into his mind, I'm willing to lend them.\n\nIf enough thoughtful Germans had read The Dynasts before July, 1914,\nthere would have been no war.\n\nIf every delegate to the Peace Conference could be made to read it\nbefore the sessions begin, there will be no more wars.\n\n                               R.  MIFFLIN.\n\n\n\"Dear me,\" said Titania, \"Is it so good as all that?  Perhaps I'd\nbetter read it.\"\n\n\"It is so good that if I knew any way of doing so I'd insist on Mr.\nWilson reading it on his voyage to France.  I wish I could get it onto\nhis ship.  My, what a book!  It makes one positively ill with pity and\nterror.  Sometimes I wake up at night and look out of the window and\nimagine I hear Hardy laughing.  I get him a little mixed up with the\nDeity, I fear.  But he's a bit too hard for you to tackle.\"\n\nTitania was puzzled, and said nothing.  But her busy mind made a note\nof its own:  Hardy, hard to read, makes one ill, try it.\n\n\"What did you think of the books I put in your room?\" said Roger.  He\nhad vowed to wait until she made some comment unsolicited, but he could\nnot restrain himself.\n\n\"In my room?\" she said.  \"Why, I'm sorry, I never noticed them!\"\n\n\n\nChapter IV\n\nThe Disappearing Volume\n\n\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Roger after supper that evening, \"I think perhaps\nwe had better introduce Miss Titania to our custom of reading aloud.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it would bore her?\" said Helen.  \"You know it isn't everybody\nthat likes being read to.\"\n\n\"Oh, I should love it!\" exclaimed Titania.  \"I don't think anybody ever\nread to me, that is not since I was a child.\"\n\n\"Suppose we leave you to look after the shop,\" said Helen to Roger, in\na teasing mood, \"and I'll take Titania out to the movies.  I think\nTarzan is still running.\"\n\nWhatever private impulses Miss Chapman may have felt, she saw by the\nbookseller's downcast face that a visit to Tarzan would break his\nheart, and she was prompt to disclaim any taste for the screen classic.\n\n\"Dear me,\" she said; \"Tarzan--that's all that nature stuff by John\nBurroughs; isn't it?  Oh, Mrs. Mifflin, I think it would be very\ntedious.  Let's have Mr. Mifflin read to us.  I'll get down my knitting\nbag.\"\n\n\"You mustn't mind being interrupted,\" said Helen.  \"When anybody rings\nthe bell Roger has to run out and tend the shop.\"\n\n\"You must let me do it,\" said Titania.  \"I want to earn my wages, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Mrs. Mifflin; \"Roger, you settle Miss Chapman in the\nden and give her something to look at while we do the dishes.\"\n\nBut Roger was all on fire to begin the reading.  \"Why don't we postpone\nthe dishes,\" he said, \"just to celebrate?\"\n\n\"Let me help,\" insisted Titania.  \"I should think washing up would be\ngreat fun.\"\n\n\"No, no, not on your first evening,\" said Helen.  \"Mr. Mifflin and I\nwill finish them in a jiffy.\"\n\nSo Roger poked up the coal fire in the den, disposed the chairs, and\ngave Titania a copy of Sartor Resartus to look at.  He then vanished\ninto the kitchen with his wife, whence Titania heard the cheerful clank\nof crockery in a dishpan and the splashing of hot water.  \"The best\nthing about washing up,\" she heard Roger say, \"is that it makes one's\nhands so clean, a novel sensation for a second-hand bookseller.\"\n\nShe gave Sartor Resartus what is graphically described as a \"once\nover,\" and then seeing the morning Times lying on the table, picked it\nup, as she had not read it.  Her eye fell upon the column headed\n\n\n                         LOST AND FOUND\n                    Fifty cents an agate line\n\n\nand as she had recently lost a little pearl brooch, she ran hastily\nthrough it.  She chuckled a little over\n\nLOST--Hotel Imperial lavatory, set of teeth.  Call or communicate\nSteel, 134 East 43 St. Reward, no questions asked.\n\nThen she saw this:\n\n\nLOST--Copy of Thomas Carlyle's \"Oliver Cromwell,\" between Gissing\nStreet, Brooklyn, and the Octagon Hotel.  If found before midnight,\nTuesday, Dec. 3, return to assistant chef, Octagon Hotel.\n\n\n\"Why\" she exclaimed, \"Gissing Street--that's here!  And what a funny\nkind of book for an assistant chef to read.  No wonder their lunches\nhave been so bad lately!\"\n\nWhen Roger and Helen rejoined her in the den a few minutes later she\nshowed the bookseller the advertisement.  He was very much excited.\n\n\"That's a funny thing,\" he said.  \"There's something queer about that\nbook.  Did I tell you about it?  Last Tuesday--I know it was then\nbecause it was the evening young Gilbert was here--a man with a beard\ncame in asking for it, and it wasn't on the shelf.  Then the next\nnight, Wednesday, I was up very late writing, and fell asleep at my\ndesk.  I must have left the front door ajar, because I was waked up by\nthe draught, and when I went to close the door I saw the book sticking\nout a little beyond the others, in its usual place.  And last night,\nwhen the Corn Cobs were here, I went out to look up a quotation in it,\nand it was gone again.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the assistant chef stole it?\" said Titania.\n\n\"But if so, why the deuce would he advertise having done so?\" asked\nRoger.\n\n\"Well, if he did steal it,\" said Helen, \"I wish him joy of it.  I tried\nto read it once, you talked so much about it, and I found it dreadfully\ndull.\"\n\n\"If he did steal it,\" cried the bookseller, \"I'm perfectly delighted.\nIt shows that my contention is right:  people DO really care for good\nbooks.  If an assistant chef is so fond of good books that he has to\nsteal them, the world is safe for democracy.  Usually the only books\nany one wants to steal are sheer piffle, like Making Life Worth While\nby Douglas Fairbanks or Mother Shipton's Book of Oracles.  I don't mind\na man stealing books if he steals good ones!\"\n\n\"You see the remarkable principles that govern this business,\" said\nHelen to Titania.  They sat down by the fire and took up their knitting\nwhile the bookseller ran out to see if the volume had by any chance\nreturned to his shelves.\n\n\"Is it there?\" said Helen, when he came back.\n\n\"No,\" said Roger, and picked up the advertisement again.  \"I wonder why\nhe wants it returned before midnight on Tuesday?\"\n\n\"So he can read it in bed, I guess,\" said Helen.  \"Perhaps he suffers\nfrom insomnia.\"\n\n\"It's a darn shame he lost it before he had a chance to read it.  I'd\nlike to have known what he thought of it.  I've got a great mind to go\nup and call on him.\"\n\n\"Charge it off to profit and loss and forget about it,\" said Helen.\n\"How about that reading aloud?\"\n\nRoger ran his eye along his private shelves, and pulled down a\nwell-worn volume.\n\n\"Now that Thanksgiving is past,\" he said, \"my mind always turns to\nChristmas, and Christmas means Charles Dickens.  My dear, would it bore\nyou if we had a go at the old Christmas Stories?\"\n\nMrs. Mifflin held up her hands in mock dismay.  \"He reads them to me\nevery year at this time,\" she said to Titania.  \"Still, they're worth\nit.  I know good old Mrs. Lirriper better than I do most of my friends.\"\n\n\"What is it, the Christmas Carol?\" said Titania.  \"We had to read that\nin school.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Roger; \"the other stories, infinitely better.  Everybody\ngets the Carol dinned into them until they're weary of it, but no one\nnowadays seems to read the others.  I tell you, Christmas wouldn't be\nChristmas to me if I didn't read these tales over again every year.\nHow homesick they make one for the good old days of real inns and real\nbeefsteak and real ale drawn in pewter.  My dears, sometimes when I am\nreading Dickens I get a vision of rare sirloin with floury boiled\npotatoes and plenty of horse-radish, set on a shining cloth not far\nfrom a blaze of English coal----\"\n\n\"He's an incorrigible visionary,\" said Mrs. Mifflin.  \"To hear him talk\nyou might think no one had had a square meal since Dickens died.  You\nmight think that all landladies died with Mrs. Lirriper.\"\n\n\"Very ungrateful of him,\" said Titania.  \"I'm sure I couldn't ask for\nbetter potatoes, or a nicer hostess, than I've found in Brooklyn.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said Roger.  \"You are right, of course.  And yet\nsomething went out of the world when Victorian England vanished,\nsomething that will never come again.  Take the stagecoach drivers, for\ninstance.  What a racy, human type they were!  And what have we now to\ncompare with them?  Subway guards?  Taxicab drivers?  I have hung\naround many an all-night lunchroom to hear the chauffeurs talk.  But\nthey are too much on the move, you can't get the picture of them the\nway Dickens could of his types.  You can't catch that sort of thing in\na snapshot, you know:  you have to have a time exposure.  I'll grant\nyou, though, that lunchroom food is mighty good.  The best place to eat\nis always a counter where the chauffeurs congregate.  They get awfully\nhungry, you see, driving round in the cold, and when they want food\nthey want it hot and tasty.  There's a little hash-alley called\nFrank's, up on Broadway near 77th, where I guess the ham and eggs and\nFrench fried is as good as any Mr. Pickwick ever ate.\"\n\n\"I must get Edwards to take me there,\" said Titania.  \"Edwards is our\nchauffeur.  I've been to the Ansonia for tea, that's near there.\"\n\n\"Better keep away,\" said Helen.  \"When Roger comes home from those\nplaces he smells so strong of onions it brings tears to my eyes.\"\n\n\"We've just been talking about an assistant chef,\" said Roger; \"that\nsuggests that I read you Somebody's Luggage, which is all about a head\nwaiter.  I have often wished I could get a job as a waiter or a bus\nboy, just to learn if there really are any such head waiters nowadays.\nYou know there are all sorts of jobs I'd like to have, just to fructify\nmy knowledge of human nature and find out whether life is really as\ngood as literature.  I'd love to be a waiter, a barber, a\nfloorwalker----\"\n\n\"Roger, my dear,\" said Helen, \"why don't you get on with the reading?\"\n\nRoger knocked out his pipe, turned Bock out of his chair, and sat down\nwith infinite relish to read the memorable character sketch of\nChristopher, the head waiter, which is dear to every lover of taverns.\n\"The writer of these humble lines being a Waiter,\" he began.  The\nknitting needles flashed with diligence, and the dog by the fender\nstretched himself out in the luxuriant vacancy of mind only known to\ndogs surrounded by a happy group of their friends.  And Roger, enjoying\nhimself enormously, and particularly pleased by the chuckles of his\naudience, was approaching the ever-delightful items of the coffee-room\nbill which is to be found about ten pages on in the first chapter--how\nsad it is that hotel bills are not so rendered in these times--when the\nbell in the shop clanged.  Picking up his pipe and matchbox, and\ngrumbling \"It's always the way,\" he hurried out of the room.\n\nHe was agreeably surprised to find that his caller was the young\nadvertising man, Aubrey Gilbert.\n\n\"Hullo!\" he said.  \"I've been saving something for you.  It's a\nquotation from Joseph Conrad about advertising.\"\n\n\"Good enough,\" said Aubrey.  \"And I've got something for you.  You were\nso nice to me the other evening I took the liberty of bringing you\nround some tobacco.  Here's a tin of Blue-Eyed Mixture, it's my\nfavourite.  I hope you'll like it.\"\n\n\"Bully for you.  Perhaps I ought to let you off the Conrad quotation\nsince you're so kind.\"\n\n\"Not a bit.  I suppose it's a knock.  Shoot!\"  The bookseller led the\nway back to his desk, where he rummaged among the litter and finally\nfound a scrap of paper on which he had written:\n\n\nBeing myself animated by feelings of affection toward my fellowmen, I\nam saddened by the modern system of advertising.  Whatever evidence it\noffers of enterprise, ingenuity, impudence, and resource in certain\nindividuals, it proves to my mind the wide prevalence of that form of\nmental degradation which is called gullibility.\n                                             JOSEPH CONRAD.\n\n\n\"What do you think of that?\" said Roger.  \"You'll find that in the\nstory called The Anarchist.\"\n\n\"I think less than nothing of it,\" said Aubrey.  \"As your friend Don\nMarquis observed the other evening, an idea isn't always to be blamed\nfor the people who believe in it.  Mr. Conrad has been reading some\nquack ads, that's all.  Because there are fake ads, that doesn't\ncondemn the principle of Publicity.  But look here, what I really came\nround to see you for is to show you this.  It was in the Times this\nmorning.\"\n\nHe pulled out of his pocket a clipping of the LOST insertion to which\nRoger's attention had already been drawn.\n\n\"Yes, I've just seen it,\" said Roger.  \"I missed the book from my\nshelves, and I believe someone must have stolen it.\"\n\n\"Well, now, I want to tell you something,\" said Aubrey.  \"To-night I\nhad dinner at the Octagon with Mr. Chapman.\"  \"Is that so?\" said Roger.\n\"You know his daughter's here now.\"\n\n\"So he told me.  It's rather interesting how it all works out.  You\nsee, after you told me the other day that Miss Chapman was coming to\nwork for you, that gave me an idea.  I knew her father would be\nspecially interested in Brooklyn, on that account, and it suggested to\nme an idea for a window-display campaign here in Brooklyn for the\nDaintybits Products.  You know we handle all his sales promotion\ncampaigns.  Of course I didn't let on that I knew about his daughter\ncoming over here, but he told me about it himself in the course of our\ntalk.  Well, here's what I'm getting at.  We had dinner in the\nCzecho-Slovak Grill, up on the fourteenth floor, and going up in the\nelevator I saw a man in a chef's uniform carrying a book.  I looked\nover his shoulder to see what it was.  I thought of course it would be\na cook-book.  It was a copy of Oliver Cromwell.\"\n\n\"So he found it again, eh?  I must go and have a talk with that chap.\nIf he's a Carlyle fan I'd like to know him.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute.  I had seen the LOST ad in the paper this morning,\nbecause I always look over that column.  Often it gives me ideas for\nadvertising stunts.  If you keep an eye on the things people are\nanxious to get back, you know what they really prize, and if you know\nwhat they prize you can get a line on what goods ought to be advertised\nmore extensively.  This was the first time I had ever noticed a LOST ad\nfor a book, so I thought to myself \"the book business is coming up.\"\nWell, when I saw the chef with the book in his hand, I said to him\njokingly, \"I see you found it again.\" He was a foreign-looking fellow,\nwith a big beard, which is unusual for a chef, because I suppose it's\nlikely to get in the soup.  He looked at me as though I'd run a carving\nknife into him, almost scared me the way he looked.  \"Yes, yes,\" he\nsaid, and shoved the book out of sight under his arm.  He seemed half\nangry and half frightened, so I thought maybe he had no right to be\nriding in the passenger elevator and was scared someone would report\nhim to the manager.  Just as we were getting to the fourteenth floor I\nsaid to him in a whisper, \"It's all right, old chap, I'm not going to\nreport you.\" I give you my word he looked more scared than before.  He\nwent quite white.  I got off at the fourteenth, and he followed me out.\nI thought he was going to speak to me, but Mr. Chapman was there in the\nlobby, and he didn't have a chance.  But I noticed that he watched me\ninto the grill room as though I was his last chance of salvation.\"\n\n\"I guess the poor devil was scared you'd report him to the police for\nstealing the book,\" said Roger.  \"Never mind, let him have it.\"\n\n\"Did he steal it?\"\n\n\"I haven't a notion.  But somebody did, because it disappeared from\nhere.\"\n\n\"Well, now, wait a minute.  Here's the queer part of it.  I didn't\nthink anything more about it, except that it was a funny coincidence my\nseeing him after having noticed that ad in the paper.  I had a long\ntalk with Mr. Chapman, and we discussed some plans for a prune and\nSaratoga chip campaign, and I showed him some suggested copy I had\nprepared.  Then he told me about his daughter, and I let on that I knew\nyou.  I left the Octagon about eight o'clock, and I thought I'd run\nover here on the subway just to show you the LOST notice and give you\nthis tobacco.  And when I got off the subway at Atlantic Avenue, who\nshould I see but friend chef again.  He got off the same train I did.\nHe had on civilian clothes then, of course, and when he was out of his\nwhite uniform and pancake hat I recognized him right off.  Who do you\nsuppose it was?\"\n\n\"Can't imagine,\" said Roger, highly interested by this time.\n\n\"Why, the professor-looking guy who came in to ask for the book the\nfirst night I was here.\"\n\n\"Humph!  Well, he must be keen about Carlyle, because he was horribly\ndisappointed that evening when he asked for the book and I couldn't\nfind it.  I remember how he insisted that I MUST have it, and I hunted\nall through the History shelves to make sure it hadn't got misplaced.\nHe said that some friend of his had seen it here, and he had come right\nround to buy it.  I told him he could certainly get a copy at the\nPublic Library, and he said that wouldn't do at all.\"\n\n\"Well, I think he's nuts,\" said Aubrey, \"because I'm damn sure he\nfollowed me down the street after I left the subway.  I stopped in at\nthe drug store on the corner to get some matches, and when I came out,\nthere he was underneath the lamp-post.\"\n\n\"If it was a modern author, instead of Carlyle,\" said Roger, \"I'd say\nit was some publicity stunt pulled off by the publishers.  You know\nthey go to all manner of queer dodges to get an author's name in print.\nBut Carlyle's copyrights expired long ago, so I don't see the game.\"\n\n\"I guess he's picketing your place to try and steal the formula for\neggs Samuel Butler,\" said Aubrey, and they both laughed.\n\n\"You'd better come in and meet my wife and Miss Chapman,\" said Roger.\nThe young man made some feeble demur, but it was obvious to the\nbookseller that he was vastly elated at the idea of making Miss\nChapman's acquaintance.\n\n\"Here's a friend of mine,\" said Roger, ushering Aubrey into the little\nroom where Helen and Titania were still sitting by the fire.  \"Mrs.\nMifflin, Mr. Aubrey Gilbert, Miss Chapman, Mr. Gilbert.\"\n\nAubrey was vaguely aware of the rows of books, of the shining coals, of\nthe buxom hostess and the friendly terrier; but with the intense focus\nof an intelligent young male mind these were all merely appurtenances\nto the congenial spectacle of the employee.  How quickly a young man's\nsenses assemble and assimilate the data that are really relevant!\nWithout seeming even to look in that direction he had performed the\nmost amazing feat of lightning calculation known to the human\nfaculties.  He had added up all the young ladies of his acquaintance,\nand found the sum total less than the girl before him.  He had\nsubtracted the new phenomenon from the universe as he knew it,\nincluding the solar system and the advertising business, and found the\nremainder a minus quantity.  He had multiplied the contents of his\nintellect by a factor he had no reason to assume \"constant,\" and was\nstartled at what teachers call (I believe) the \"product.\"  And he had\ndivided what was in the left-hand armchair into his own career, and\nfound no room for a quotient.  All of which transpired in the length of\ntime necessary for Roger to push forward another chair.\n\nWith the politeness desirable in a well-bred youth, Aubrey's first\ninstinct was to make himself square with the hostess.  Resolutely he\noccluded blue eyes, silk shirtwaist, and admirable chin from his mental\nvision.\n\n\"It's awfully good of you to let me come in,\" he said to Mrs. Mifflin.\n\"I was here the other evening and Mr. Mifflin insisted on my staying to\nsupper with him.\"\n\n\"I'm very glad to see you,\" said Helen.  \"Roger told me about you.  I\nhope he didn't poison you with any of his outlandish dishes.  Wait till\nhe tries you with brandied peaches a la Harold Bell Wright.\"\n\nAubrey uttered some genial reassurance, still making the supreme\nsacrifice of keeping his eyes away from where (he felt) they belonged.\n\n\"Mr. Gilbert has just had a queer experience,\" said Roger.  \"Tell them\nabout it.\"\n\nIn the most reckless way, Aubrey permitted himself to be impaled upon a\ndirect and interested flash of blue lightning.  \"I was having dinner\nwith your father at the Octagon.\"\n\nThe high tension voltage of that bright blue current felt like ohm\nsweet ohm, but Aubrey dared not risk too much of it at once.  Fearing\nto blow out a fuse, he turned in panic to Mrs. Mifflin.  \"You see,\" he\nexplained, \"I write a good deal of Mr. Chapman's advertising for him.\nWe had an appointment to discuss some business matters.  We're planning\na big barrage on prunes.\"\n\n\"Dad works much too hard, don't you think?\" said Titania.\n\nAubrey welcomed this as a pleasant avenue of discussion leading into\nthe parkland of Miss Chapman's family affairs; but Roger insisted on\nhis telling the story of the chef and the copy of Cromwell.\n\n\"And he followed you here?\" exclaimed Titania.  \"What fun!  I had no\nidea the book business was so exciting.\"\n\n\"Better lock the door to-night, Roger,\" said Mrs. Mifflin, \"or he may\nwalk off with a set of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.\"\n\n\"Why, my dear,\" said Roger, \"I think this is grand news.  Here's a man,\nin a humble walk of life, so keen about good books that he even pickets\na bookstore on the chance of swiping some.  It's the most encouraging\nthing I've ever heard of.  I must write to the Publishers' Weekly about\nit.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Aubrey, \"you mustn't let me interrupt your little party.\"\n\n\"You're not interrupting,\" said Roger.  \"We were only reading aloud.\nDo you know Dickens' Christmas Stories?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't.\"\n\n\"Suppose we go on reading, shall we?\"\n\n\"Please do.\"\n\n\"Yes, do go on,\" said Titania.  \"Mr. Mifflin was just reading about a\nmost adorable head waiter in a London chop house.\"\n\nAubrey begged permission to light his pipe, and Roger picked up the\nbook.  \"But before we read the items of the coffee-room bill,\" he said,\n\"I think it only right that we should have a little refreshment.  This\npassage should never be read without something to accompany it.  My\ndear, what do you say to a glass of sherry all round?\"\n\n\"It is sad to have to confess it,\" said Mrs. Mifflin to Titania, \"Mr.\nMifflin can never read Dickens without having something to drink.  I\nthink the sale of Dickens will fall off terribly when prohibition comes\nin.\"\n\n\"I once took the trouble to compile a list of the amount of liquor\ndrunk in Dickens' works,\" said Roger, \"and I assure you the total was\nastounding:  7,000 hogsheads, I believe it was.  Calculations of that\nsort are great fun.  I have always intended to write a little essay on\nthe rainstorms in the stories of Robert Louis Stevenson.  You see R. L.\nS. was a Scot, and well acquainted with wet weather.  Excuse me a\nmoment, I'll just run down cellar and get up a bottle.\"\n\nRoger left the room, and they heard his steps passing down into the\ncellar.  Bock, after the manner of dogs, followed him.  The smells of\ncellars are a rare treat to dogs, especially ancient Brooklyn cellars\nwhich have a cachet all their own.  The cellar of the Haunted Bookshop\nwas, to Bock, a fascinating place, illuminated by a warm glow from the\nfurnace, and piled high with split packing-cases which Roger used as\nkindling.  From below came the rasp of a shovel among coal, and the\nclear, musical slither as the lumps were thrown from the iron scoop\nonto the fire.  Just then the bell rang in the shop.\n\n\"Let me go,\" said Titania, jumping up.\n\n\"Can't I?\" said Aubrey.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Mrs. Mifflin, laying down her knitting.  \"Neither of\nyou knows anything about the stock.  Sit down and be comfortable.  I'll\nbe right back.\"\n\nAubrey and Titania looked at each other with a touch of embarrassment.\n\n\"Your father sent you his--his kind regards,\" said Aubrey.  That was\nnot what he had intended to say, but somehow he could not utter the\nword.  \"He said not to read all the books at once.\"\n\nTitania laughed.  \"How funny that you should run into him just when you\nwere coming here.  He's a duck, isn't he?\"\n\n\"Well, you see I only know him in a business way, but he certainly is a\ncorker.  He believes in advertising, too.\"\n\n\"Are you crazy about books?\"\n\n\"Why, I never really had very much to do with them.  I'm afraid you'll\nthink I'm terribly ignorant----\"\n\n\"Not at all.  I'm awfully glad to meet someone who doesn't think it's a\ncrime not to have read all the books there are.\"\n\n\"This is a queer kind of place, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, it's a funny idea to call it the Haunted Bookshop.  I wonder what\nit means.\"\n\n\"Mr. Mifflin told me it meant haunted by the ghosts of great\nliterature.  I hope they won't annoy you.  The ghost of Thomas Carlyle\nseems to be pretty active.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid of ghosts,\" said Titania.\n\nAubrey gazed at the fire.  He wanted to say that he intended from now\non to do a little haunting on his own account but he did not know just\nhow to break it gently.  And then Roger returned from the cellar with\nthe bottle of sherry.  As he was uncorking it, they heard the shop door\nclose, and Mrs. Mifflin came in.\n\n\"Well, Roger,\" she said; \"if you think so much of your old Cromwell,\nyou'd better keep it in here.  Here it is.\"  She laid the book on the\ntable.\n\n\"For the love of Mike!\" exclaimed Roger.  \"Who brought it back?\"\n\n\"I guess it was your friend the assistant chef,\" said Mrs. Mifflin.\n\"Anyway, he had a beard like a Christmas tree.  He was mighty polite.\nHe said he was terribly absent minded, and that the other day he was in\nhere looking at some books and just walked off with it without knowing\nwhat he was doing.  He offered to pay for the trouble he had caused,\nbut of course I wouldn't let him.  I asked if he wanted to see you, but\nhe said he was in a hurry.\"\n\n\"I'm almost disappointed,\" said Roger.  \"I thought that I had turned up\na real booklover.  Here we are, all hands drink the health of Mr.\nThomas Carlyle.\"\n\nThe toast was drunk, and they settled themselves in their chairs.\n\n\"And here's to the new employee,\" said Helen.  This also was\ndispatched, Aubrey draining his glass with a zeal which did not escape\nMiss Chapman's discerning eye.  Roger then put out his hand for the\nDickens.  But first he picked up his beloved Cromwell.  He looked at it\ncarefully, and then held the volume close to the light.\n\n\"The mystery's not over yet,\" he said.  \"It's been rebound.  This isn't\nthe original binding.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\" said Helen in surprise.  \"It looks the same.\"\n\n\"The binding has been cleverly imitated, but it can't fool me.  In the\nfirst place, there was a rubbed corner at the top; and there was an ink\nstain on one of the end papers.\"\n\n\"There's still a stain there,\" said Aubrey, looking over his shoulder.\n\n\"Yes, but not the same stain.  I've had that book long enough to know\nit by heart.  Now what the deuce would that lunatic want to have it\nrebound for?\"\n\n\"Goodness gracious,\" said Helen, \"put it away and forget about it.\nWe'll all be dreaming about Carlyle if you're not careful.\"\n\n\n\nChapter V\n\nAubrey Walks Part Way Home--and Rides The Rest of the Way\n\n\nIt was a cold, clear night as Mr. Aubrey Gilbert left the Haunted\nBookshop that evening, and set out to walk homeward.  Without making a\nvery conscious choice, he felt instinctively that it would be agreeable\nto walk back to Manhattan rather than permit the roaring disillusion of\nthe subway to break in upon his meditations.\n\nIt is to be feared that Aubrey would have badly flunked any quizzing on\nthe chapters of Somebody's Luggage which the bookseller had read aloud.\nHis mind was swimming rapidly in the agreeable, unfettered fashion of a\nstream rippling downhill.  As O. Henry puts it in one of his most\ndelightful stories:  \"He was outwardly decent and managed to preserve\nhis aquarium, but inside he was impromptu and full of unexpectedness.\"\nTo say that he was thinking of Miss Chapman would imply too much power\nof ratiocination and abstract scrutiny on his part.  He was not\nthinking:  he was being thought.  Down the accustomed channels of his\nintellect he felt his mind ebbing with the irresistible movement of\ntides drawn by the blandishing moon.  And across these shimmering\nestuaries of impulse his will, a lost and naked athlete, was painfully\nattempting to swim, but making much leeway and already almost resigned\nto being carried out to sea.\n\nHe stopped a moment at Weintraub's drug store, on the corner of Gissing\nStreet and Wordsworth Avenue, to buy some cigarettes, unfailing solace\nof an agitated bosom.\n\nIt was the usual old-fashioned pharmacy of those parts of Brooklyn:\ntall red, green, and blue vases of liquid in the windows threw blotches\nof coloured light onto the pavement; on the panes was affixed white\nchina lettering:  H. WE TRAUB, DEUT CHE APOTHEKER.  Inside, the\ncustomary shelves of labelled jars, glass cases holding cigars,\nnostrums and toilet knick-knacks, and in one corner an ancient\nrevolving bookcase deposited long ago by the Tabard Inn Library.  The\nshop was empty, but as he opened the door a bell buzzed sharply.  In a\nback chamber he could hear voices.  As he waited idly for the druggist\nto appear, Aubrey cast a tolerant eye over the dusty volumes in the\ntwirling case.  There were the usual copies of Harold MacGrath's The\nMan on the Box, A Girl of the Limberlost, and The Houseboat on the\nStyx.  The Divine Fire, much grimed, leaned against Joe Chapple's Heart\nThrobs.  Those familiar with the Tabard Inn bookcases still to be found\nin outlying drug-shops know that the stock has not been \"turned\" for\nmany a year.  Aubrey was the more surprised, on spinning the the case\nround, to find wedged in between two other volumes the empty cover of a\nbook that had been torn loose from the pages to which it belonged.  He\nglanced at the lettering on the back.  It ran thus:\n\n\n                             CARLYLE\n                              ----\n                        OLIVER CROMWELL'S\n                             LETTERS\n                               AND\n                            SPEECHES\n\nObeying a sudden impulse, he slipped the book cover in his overcoat\npocket.\n\nMr. Weintraub entered the shop, a solid Teutonic person with\ndiscoloured pouches under his eyes and a face that was a potent\nargument for prohibition.  His manner, however, was that of one anxious\nto please.  Aubrey indicated the brand of cigarettes he wanted.  Having\nhimself coined the advertising catchword for them--They're mild--but\nthey satisfy--he felt a certain loyal compulsion always to smoke this\nkind.  The druggist held out the packet, and Aubrey noticed that his\nfingers were stained a deep saffron colour.\n\n\"I see you're a cigarette smoker, too,\" said Aubrey pleasantly, as he\nopened the packet and lit one of the paper tubes at a little alcohol\nflame burning in a globe of blue glass on the counter.\n\n\"Me?  I never smoke,\" said Mr. Weintraub, with a smile which somehow\ndid not seem to fit his surly face.  \"I must have steady nerves in my\nprofession.  Apothecaries who smoke make up bad prescriptions.\"\n\n\"Well, how do you get your hands stained that way?\"\n\nMr. Weintraub removed his hands from the counter.\n\n\"Chemicals,\" he grunted.  \"Prescriptions--all that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Aubrey, \"smoking's a bad habit.  I guess I do too much of\nit.\"  He could not resist the impression that someone was listening to\ntheir talk.  The doorway at the back of the shop was veiled by a\nportiere of beads and thin bamboo sections threaded on strings.  He\nheard them clicking as though they had been momentarily pulled aside.\nTurning, just as he opened the door to leave, he noticed the bamboo\ncurtain swaying.\n\n\"Well, good-night,\" he said, and stepped out onto the street.\n\nAs he walked down Wordsworth Avenue, under the thunder of the L, past\nlighted lunchrooms, oyster saloons, and pawnshops, Miss Chapman resumed\nher sway.  With the delightful velocity of thought his mind whirled in\na narrowing spiral round the experience of the evening.  The small\nbook-crammed sitting room of the Mifflins, the sparkling fire, the\nlively chirrup of the bookseller reading aloud--and there, in the old\neasy chair whose horsehair stuffing was bulging out, that blue-eyed\nvision of careless girlhood!  Happily he had been so seated that he\ncould study her without seeming to do so.  The line of her ankle where\nthe firelight danced upon it put Coles Phillips to shame, he averred.\nExtraordinary, how these creatures are made to torment us with their\nintolerable comeliness!  Against the background of dusky bindings her\nhead shone with a soft haze of gold.  Her face, that had an air of\nnaive and provoking independence, made him angry with its unnecessary\nsurplus of enchantment.  An unaccountable gust of rage drove him\nrapidly along the frozen street.  \"Damn it,\" he cried, \"what right has\nany girl to be as pretty as that?  Why--why, I'd like to beat her!\" he\nmuttered, amazed at himself.  \"What the devil right has a girl got to\nlook so innocently adorable?\"\n\nIt would be unseemly to follow poor Aubrey in his vacillations of rage\nand worship as he thrashed along Wordsworth Avenue, hearing and seeing\nno more than was necessary for the preservation of his life at street\ncrossings.  Half-smoked cigarette stubs glowed in his wake;[2] his\nburly bosom echoed with incoherent oratory.  In the darker stretches of\nFulton Street that lead up to the Brooklyn Bridge he fiercely\nexclaimed:  \"By God, it's not such a bad world.\" As he ascended the\nslope of that vast airy span, a black midget against a froth of stars,\nhe was gravely planning such vehemence of exploit in the advertising\nprofession as would make it seem less absurd to approach the President\nof the Daintybits Corporation with a question for which no progenitor\nof loveliness is ever quite prepared.\n\n\n[2] NOTE WHILE PROOFREADING:  Surely this phrase was unconsciously\nlifted from R. L. S. But where does the original occur?  C. D. M.\n\nIn the exact centre of the bridge something diluted his mood; he\nhalted, leaning against the railing, to consider the splendour of the\nscene.  The hour was late--moving on toward midnight--but in the tall\nblack precipices of Manhattan scattered lights gleamed, in an odd,\nirregular pattern like the sparse punctures on the raffle-board--\"take\na chance on a Milk-Fed Turkey\"--the East Indian elevator-boy presents\nto apartment-house tenants about Hallowe'en.  A fume of golden light\neddied over uptown merriment:  he could see the ruby beacon on the\nMetropolitan Tower signal three quarters.  Underneath the airy decking\nof the bridge a tug went puffing by, her port and starboard lamps\ntrailing red and green threads over the tideway.  Some great argosy of\nthe Staten Island fleet swept serenely down to St. George, past Liberty\nin her soft robe of light, carrying theatred commuters, dazed with\nweariness and blinking at the raw fury of the electric bulbs.  Overhead\nthe night was a superb arch of clear frost, sifted with stars.  Blue\nsparks crackled stickily along the trolley wires as the cars groaned\nover the bridge.\n\nAubrey surveyed all this splendid scene without exact observation.  He\nwas of a philosophic turn, and was attempting to console his\ndiscomfiture in the overwhelming lustre of Miss Titania by the thought\nthat she was, after all, the creature and offspring of the science he\nworshipped--that of Advertising.  Was not the fragrance of her\npresence, the soft compulsion of her gaze, even the delirious frill of\nmuslin at her wrist, to be set down to the credit of his chosen art?\nHad he not, pondering obscurely upon \"attention-compelling\" copy and\nlay-out and type-face, in a corner of the Grey-Matter office,\ncontributed to the triumphant prosperity and grace of this unconscious\nbeneficiary?  Indeed she seemed to him, fiercely tormenting himself\nwith her loveliness, a symbol of the mysterious and subtle power of\npublicity.  It was Advertising that had done this--that had enabled Mr.\nChapman, a shy and droll little person, to surround this girl with all\nthe fructifying glories of civilization--to foster and cherish her\nuntil she shone upon the earth like a morning star!  Advertising had\nclothed her, Advertising had fed her, schooled, roofed, and sheltered\nher.  In a sense she was the crowning advertisement of her father's\ncareer, and her innocent perfection taunted him just as much as the\nbright sky-sign he knew was flashing the words CHAPMAN PRUNES above the\nteeming pavements of Times Square.  He groaned to think that he\nhimself, by his conscientious labours, had helped to put this girl in\nsuch a position that he could hardly dare approach her.\n\nHe would never have approached her again, on any pretext, if the\nintensity of his thoughts had not caused him, unconsciously, to grip\nthe railing of the bridge with strong and angry hands.  For at that\nmoment a sack was thrown over his head from behind and he was violently\nseized by the legs, with the obvious intent of hoisting him over the\nparapet.  His unexpected grip on the railing delayed this attempt just\nlong enough to save him.  Swept off his feet by the fury of the\nassault, he fell sideways against the barrier and had the good fortune\nto seize his enemy by the leg.  Muffled in the sacking, it was vain to\ncry out; but he held furiously to the limb he had grasped and he and\nhis attacker rolled together on the footway.  Aubrey was a powerful\nman, and even despite the surprise could probably have got the better\nof the situation; but as he wrestled desperately and tried to rid\nhimself of his hood, a crashing blow fell upon his head, half stunning\nhim.  He lay sprawled out, momentarily incapable of struggle, yet\nconscious enough to expect, rather curiously, the dizzying sensation of\na drop through insupportable air into the icy water of the East River.\nHands seized him--and then, passively, he heard a shout, the sound of\nfootsteps running on the planks, and other footsteps hurrying away at\ntop speed.  In a moment the sacking was torn from his head and a\nfriendly pedestrian was kneeling beside him.\n\n\"Say, are you all right?\" said the latter anxiously.  \"Gee, those guys\nnearly got you.\"\n\nAubrey was too faint and dizzy to speak for a moment.  His head was\nnumb and he felt certain that several inches of it had been caved in.\nPutting up his hand, feebly, he was surprised to find the contours of\nhis skull much the same as usual.  The stranger propped him against his\nknee and wiped away a trickle of blood with his handkerchief.\n\n\"Say, old man, I thought you was a goner,\" he said sympathetically.  \"I\nseen those fellows jump you.  Too bad they got away.  Dirty work, I'll\nsay so.\"\n\nAubrey gulped the night air, and sat up.  The bridge rocked under him;\nagainst the star-speckled sky he could see the Woolworth Building\nbending and jazzing like a poplar tree in a gale.  He felt very sick.\n\n\"Ever so much obliged to you,\" he stammered.  \"I'll be all right in a\nminute.\"\n\n\"D'you want me to go and ring up a nambulance?\" said his assistant.\n\n\"No, no,\" said Aubrey; \"I'll be all right.\"  He staggered to his feet\nand clung to the rail of the bridge, trying to collect his wits.  One\nphrase ran over and over in his mind with damnable iteration--\"Mild,\nbut they satisfy!\"\n\n\"Where were you going?\" said the other, supporting him.\n\n\"Madison Avenue and Thirty-Second----\"\n\n\"Maybe I can flag a jitney for you.  Here,\" he cried, as another\ncitizen approached afoot, \"Give this fellow a hand.  Someone beat him\nover the bean with a club.  I'm going to get him a lift.\"\n\nThe newcomer readily undertook the friendly task, and tied Aubrey's\nhandkerchief round his head, which was bleeding freely.  After a few\nmoments the first Samaritan succeeded in stopping a touring car which\nwas speeding over from Brooklyn.  The driver willingly agreed to take\nAubrey home, and the other two helped him in.  Barring a nasty gash on\nhis scalp he was none the worse.\n\n\"A fellow needs a tin hat if he's going to wander round Long Island at\nnight,\" said the motorist genially.  \"Two fellows tried to hold me up\ncoming in from Rockville Centre the other evening.  Maybe they were the\nsame two that picked on you.  Did you get a look at them?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Aubrey.  \"That piece of sacking might have helped me trace\nthem, but I forgot it.\"\n\n\"Want to run back for it?\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Aubrey.  \"I've got a hunch about this.\"\n\n\"Think you know who it is?  Maybe you're in politics, hey?\"\n\nThe car ran swiftly up the dark channel of the Bowery, into Fourth\nAvenue, and turned off at Thirty-Second Street to deposit Aubrey in\nfront of his boarding house.  He thanked his convoy heartily, and\nrefused further assistance.  After several false shots he got his latch\nkey in the lock, climbed four creaking flights, and stumbled into his\nroom.  Groping his way to the wash-basin, he bathed his throbbing head,\ntied a towel round it, and fell into bed.\n\n\n\nChapter VI\n\nTitania Learns the Business\n\n\nAlthough he kept late hours, Roger Mifflin was a prompt riser.  It is\nonly the very young who find satisfaction in lying abed in the morning.\nThose who approach the term of the fifth decade are sensitively aware\nof the fluency of life, and have no taste to squander it among the\nblankets.\n\nThe bookseller's morning routine was brisk and habitual.  He was\ngenerally awakened about half-past seven by the jangling bell that\nbalanced on a coiled spring at the foot of the stairs.  This ringing\nannounced the arrival of Becky, the old scrubwoman who came each\nmorning to sweep out the shop and clean the floors for the day's\ntraffic.  Roger, in his old dressing gown of vermilion flannel, would\nscuffle down to let her in, picking up the milk bottles and the paper\nbag of baker's rolls at the same time.  As Becky propped the front door\nwide, opened window transoms, and set about buffeting dust and tobacco\nsmoke, Roger would take the milk and rolls back to the kitchen and give\nBock a morning greeting.  Bock would emerge from his literary kennel,\nand thrust out his forelegs in a genial obeisance.  This was partly\npoliteness, and partly to straighten out his spine after its all-night\ncurvature.  Then Roger would let him out into the back yard for a run,\nhimself standing on the kitchen steps to inhale the bright freshness of\nthe morning air.\n\nThis Saturday morning was clear and crisp.  The plain backs of the\nhomes along Whittier Street, irregular in profile as the margins of a\nfree verse poem, offered Roger an agreeable human panorama.  Thin\nstrands of smoke were rising from chimneys; a belated baker's wagon was\njoggling down the alley; in bedroom bay-windows sheets and pillows were\nalready set to sun and air.  Brooklyn, admirable borough of homes and\nhearty breakfasts, attacks the morning hours in cheery, smiling spirit.\nBock sniffed and rooted about the small back yard as though the earth\n(every cubic inch of which he already knew by rote) held some new\nentrancing flavour.  Roger watched him with the amused and tender\ncondescension one always feels toward a happy dog--perhaps the same\nmood of tolerant paternalism that Gott is said to have felt in watching\nhis boisterous Hohenzollerns.\n\nThe nipping air began to infiltrate his dressing gown, and Roger\nreturned to the kitchen, his small, lively face alight with zest.  He\nopened the draughts in the range, set a kettle on to boil, and went\ndown to resuscitate the furnace.  As he came upstairs for his bath,\nMrs. Mifflin was descending, fresh and hearty in a starchy morning\napron.  Roger hummed a tune as he picked up the hairpins on the bedroom\nfloor, and wondered to himself why women are always supposed to be more\ntidy than men.\n\nTitania was awake early.  She smiled at the enigmatic portrait of\nSamuel Butler, glanced at the row of books over her bed, and dressed\nrapidly.  She ran downstairs, eager to begin her experience as a\nbookseller.  The first impression the Haunted Bookshop had made on her\nwas one of superfluous dinginess, and as Mrs. Mifflin refused to let\nher help get breakfast--except set out the salt cellars--she ran down\nGissing Street to a little florist's shop she had noticed the previous\nafternoon.  Here she spent at least a week's salary in buying\nchrysanthemums and a large pot of white heather.  She was distributing\nthese about the shop when Roger found her.\n\n\"Bless my soul!\" he said.  \"How are you going to live on your wages if\nyou do that sort of thing?  Pay-day doesn't come until next Friday!\"\n\n\"Just one blow-out,\" she said cheerfully.  \"I thought it would be fun\nto brighten the place up a bit.  Think how pleased your floorwalker\nwill be when he comes in!\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" said Roger.  \"I hope you don't really think we have\nfloorwalkers in the second-hand book business.\"\n\nAfter breakfast he set about initiating his new employee into the\nroutine of the shop.  As he moved about, explaining the arrangement of\nhis shelves, he kept up a running commentary.\n\n\"Of course all the miscellaneous information that a bookseller has to\nhave will only come to you gradually,\" he said.  \"Such tags of bookshop\nlore as the difference between Philo Gubb and Philip Gibbs, Mrs. Wilson\nWoodrow and Mrs. Woodrow Wilson, and all that sort of thing.  Don't be\nfrightened by all the ads you see for a book called \"Bell and Wing,\"\nbecause no one was ever heard to ask for a copy.  That's one of the\nreasons why I tell Mr. Gilbert I don't believe in advertising.  Someone\nmay ask you who wrote The Winning of the Best, and you'll have to know\nit wasn't Colonel Roosevelt but Mr. Ralph Waldo Trine.  The beauty of\nbeing a bookseller is that you don't have to be a literary critic:  all\nyou have to do to books is enjoy them.  A literary critic is the kind\nof fellow who will tell you that Wordsworth's Happy Warrior is a poem\nof 85 lines composed entirely of two sentences, one of 26 lines and one\nof 59.  What does it matter if Wordsworth wrote sentences almost as\nlong as those of Walt Whitman or Mr. Will H. Hays, if only he wrote a\ngreat poem?  Literary critics are queer birds.  There's Professor\nPhelps of Yale, for instance.  He publishes a book in 1918 and calls it\nThe Advance of English Poetry in the Twentieth Century.  To my way of\nthinking a book of that title oughtn't to be published until 2018.\nThen somebody will come along and ask you for a book of poems about a\ntypewriter, and by and by you'll learn that what they want is\nStevenson's Underwoods.  Yes, it's a complicated life.  Never argue\nwith customers.  Just give them the book they ought to have even if\nthey don't know they want it.\"\n\nThey went outside the front door, and Roger lit his pipe.  In the\nlittle area in front of the shop windows stood large empty boxes\nsupported on trestles.  \"The first thing I always do----,\" he said.\n\n\"The first thing you'll both do is catch your death of cold,\" said\nHelen over his shoulder.  \"Titania, you run and get your fur.  Roger,\ngo and find your cap.  With your bald head, you ought to know better!\"\n\nWhen they returned to the front door, Titania's blue eyes were\nsparkling above her soft tippet.\n\n\"I applaud your taste in furs,\" said Roger.  \"That is just the colour\nof tobacco smoke.\"  He blew a whiff against it to prove the likeness.\nHe felt very talkative, as most older men do when a young girl looks as\ndelightfully listenable as Titania.\n\n\"What an adorable little place,\" said Titania, looking round at the\nbookshop's space of private pavement, which was sunk below the street\nlevel.  \"You could put tables out here and serve tea in summer time.\"\n\n\"The first thing every morning,\" continued Roger, \"I set out the\nten-cent stuff in these boxes.  I take it in at night and stow it in\nthese bins.  When it rains, I shove out an awning, which is mighty good\nbusiness.  Someone is sure to take shelter, and spend the time in\nlooking over the books.  A really heavy shower is often worth fifty or\nsixty cents.  Once a week I change my pavement stock.  This week I've\ngot mostly fiction out here.  That's the sort of thing that comes in in\nunlimited numbers.  A good deal of it's tripe, but it serves its\npurpose.\"\n\n\"Aren't they rather dirty?\" said Titania doubtfully, looking at some\nlittle blue Rollo books, on which the siftings of generations had\naccumulated.  \"Would you mind if I dusted them off a bit?\"\n\n\"It's almost unheard of in the second-hand trade,\" said Roger; \"but it\nmight make them look better.\"\n\nTitania ran inside, borrowed a duster from Helen, and began\nhousecleaning the grimy boxes, while Roger chatted away in high\nspirits.  Bock already noticing the new order of things, squatted on\nthe doorstep with an air of being a party to the conversation.  Morning\npedestrians on Gissing Street passed by, wondering who the bookseller's\nengaging assistant might be.  \"I wish _I_ could find a maid like that,\"\nthought a prosperous Brooklyn housewife on her way to market.  \"I must\nring her up some day and find out how much she gets.\"\n\nRoger brought out armfuls of books while Titania dusted.\n\n\"One of the reasons I'm awfully glad you've come here to help me,\" he\nsaid, \"is that I'll be able to get out more.  I've been so tied down by\nthe shop, I haven't had a chance to scout round, buy up libraries, make\nbids on collections that are being sold, and all that sort of thing.\nMy stock is running a bit low.  If you just wait for what comes in, you\ndon't get much of the really good stuff.\"\n\nTitania was polishing a copy of The Late Mrs. Null.  \"It must be\nwonderful to have read so many books,\" she said.  \"I'm afraid I'm not a\nvery deep reader, but at any rate Dad has taught me a respect for good\nbooks.  He gets so mad because when my friends come to the house, and\nhe asks them what they've been reading, the only thing they seem to\nknow about is Dere Mable.\"\n\nRoger chuckled.  \"I hope you don't think I'm a mere highbrow,\" he said.\n\"As a customer said to me once, without meaning to be funny, 'I like\nboth the Iliad and the Argosy.'  The only thing I can't stand is\nliterature that is unfairly and intentionally flavoured with vanilla.\nConfectionery soon disgusts the palate, whether you find it in Marcus\nAurelius or Doctor Crane.  There's an odd aspect of the matter that\nsometimes strikes me: Doc Crane's remarks are just as true as Lord\nBacon's, so how is it that the Doctor puts me to sleep in a paragraph,\nwhile my Lord's essays keep me awake all night?\"\n\nTitania, being unacquainted with these philosophers, pursued the\ncharacteristic feminine course of clinging to the subject on which she\nwas informed.  The undiscerning have called this habit of mind\nirrelevant, but wrongly.  The feminine intellect leaps like a\ngrasshopper; the masculine plods as the ant.\n\n\"I see there's a new Mable book coming,\" she said.  \"It's called That's\nMe All Over Mable, and the newsstand clerk at the Octagon says he\nexpects to sell a thousand copies.\"\n\n\"Well, there's a meaning in that,\" said Roger.  \"People have a craving\nto be amused, and I'm sure I don't blame 'em.  I'm afraid I haven't\nread Dere Mable.  If it's really amusing, I'm glad they read it.  I\nsuspect it isn't a very great book, because a Philadelphia schoolgirl\nhas written a reply to it called Dere Bill, which is said to be as good\nas the original.  Now you can hardly imagine a Philadelphia flapper\nwriting an effective companion to Bacon's Essays.  But never mind, if\nthe stuff's amusing, it has its place.  The human yearning for innocent\npastime is a pathetic thing, come to think about it.  It shows what a\ndesperately grim thing life has become.  One of the most significant\nthings I know is that breathless, expectant, adoring hush that falls\nover a theatre at a Saturday matinee, when the house goes dark and the\nfootlights set the bottom of the curtain in a glow, and the latecomers\ntank over your feet climbing into their seats----\"\n\n\"Isn't it an adorable moment!\" cried Titania.\n\n\"Yes, it is,\" said Roger; \"but it makes me sad to see what tosh is\nhanded out to that eager, expectant audience, most of the time.  There\nthey all are, ready to be thrilled, eager to be worked upon,\ndeliberately putting themselves into that glorious, rare, receptive\nmood when they are clay in the artist's hand--and Lord!  what miserable\nsubstitutes for joy and sorrow are put over on them!  Day after day I\nsee people streaming into theatres and movies, and I know that more\nthan half the time they are on a blind quest, thinking they are\nsatisfied when in truth they are fed on paltry husks.  And the sad part\nabout it is that if you let yourself think you are satisfied with\nhusks, you'll have no appetite left for the real grain.\"\n\nTitania wondered, a little panic-stricken, whether she had been\npermitting herself to be satisfied with husks.  She remembered how\ngreatly she had enjoyed a Dorothy Gish film a few evenings before.\n\"But,\" she ventured, \"you said people want to be amused.  And if they\nlaugh and look happy, surely they're amused?\"\n\n\"They only think they are!\" cried Mifflin.  \"They think they're amused\nbecause they don't know what real amusement is!  Laughter and prayer\nare the two noblest habits of man; they mark us off from the brutes.\nTo laugh at cheap jests is as base as to pray to cheap gods.  To laugh\nat Fatty Arbuckle is to degrade the human spirit.\"\n\nTitania thought she was getting in rather deep, but she had the\ntenacious logic of every healthy girl.  She said:\n\n\"But a joke that seems cheap to you doesn't seem cheap to the person\nwho laughs at it, or he wouldn't laugh.\"\n\nHer face brightened as a fresh idea flooded her mind:\n\n\"The wooden image a savage prays to may seem cheap to you, but it's the\nbest god he knows, and it's all right for him to pray to it.\"\n\n\"Bully for you,\" said Roger.  \"Perfectly true.  But I've got away from\nthe point I had in mind.  Humanity is yearning now as it never did\nbefore for truth, for beauty, for the things that comfort and console\nand make life seem worth while.  I feel this all round me, every day.\nWe've been through a frightful ordeal, and every decent spirit is\nasking itself what we can do to pick up the fragments and remould the\nworld nearer to our heart's desire.  Look here, here's something I\nfound the other day in John Masefield's preface to one of his plays:\n'The truth and rapture of man are holy things, not lightly to be\nscorned.  A carelessness of life and beauty marks the glutton, the\nidler, and the fool in their deadly path across history.'  I tell you,\nI've done some pretty sober thinking as I've sat here in my bookshop\nduring the past horrible years.  Walt Whitman wrote a little poem\nduring the Civil War--Year that trembled and reeled beneath me, said\nWalt, Must I learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled, and sullen\nhymns of defeat?--I've sat here in my shop at night, and looked round\nat my shelves, looked at all the brave books that house the hopes and\ngentlenesses and dreams of men and women, and wondered if they were all\nwrong, discredited, defeated.  Wondered if the world were still merely\na jungle of fury.  I think I'd have gone balmy if it weren't for Walt\nWhitman.  Talk about Mr. Britling--Walt was the man who 'saw it\nthrough.'\n\n\"The glutton, the idler, and the fool in their deadly path across\nhistory. . . . Aye, a deadly path indeed.  The German military men\nweren't idlers, but they were gluttons and fools to the nth power.\nLook at their deadly path!  And look at other deadly paths, too.  Look\nat our slums, jails, insane asylums. . . .\n\n\"I used to wonder what I could do to justify my comfortable existence\nhere during such a time of horror.  What right had I to shirk in a\nquiet bookshop when so many men were suffering and dying through no\nfault of their own?  I tried to get into an ambulance unit, but I've\nhad no medical training and they said they didn't want men of my age\nunless they were experienced doctors.\"\n\n\"I know how you felt,\" said Titania, with a surprising look of\ncomprehension.  \"Don't you suppose that a great many girls, who\ncouldn't do anything real to help, got tired of wearing neat little\nuniforms with Sam Browne belts?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Roger, \"it was a bad time.  The war contradicted and\ndenied everything I had ever lived for.  Oh, I can't tell you how I\nfelt about it.  I can't even express it to myself.  Sometimes I used to\nfeel as I think that truly noble simpleton Henry Ford may have felt\nwhen he organized his peace voyage--that I would do anything, however\nstupid, to stop it all.  In a world where everyone was so wise and\ncynical and cruel, it was admirable to find a man so utterly simple and\nhopeful as Henry.  A boob, they called him.  Well, I say bravo for\nboobs!  I daresay most of the apostles were boobs--or maybe they called\nthem bolsheviks.\"\n\nTitania had only the vaguest notion about bolsheviks, but she had seen\na good many newspaper cartoons.\n\n\"I guess Judas was a bolshevik,\" she said innocently.\n\n\"Yes, and probably George the Third called Ben Franklin a bolshevik,\"\nretorted Roger.  \"The trouble is, truth and falsehood don't come laid\nout in black and white--Truth and Huntruth, as the wartime joke had it.\nSometimes I thought Truth had vanished from the earth,\" he cried\nbitterly.  \"Like everything else, it was rationed by the governments.\nI taught myself to disbelieve half of what I read in the papers.  I saw\nthe world clawing itself to shreds in blind rage.  I saw hardly any one\nbrave enough to face the brutalizing absurdity as it really was, and\ndescribe it.  I saw the glutton, the idler, and the fool applauding,\nwhile brave and simple men walked in the horrors of hell.  The\nstay-at-home poets turned it to pretty lyrics of glory and sacrifice.\nPerhaps half a dozen of them have told the truth.  Have you read\nSassoon?  Or Latzko's Men in War, which was so damned true that the\ngovernment suppressed it?  Humph!  Putting Truth on rations!\"\n\nHe knocked out his pipe against his heel, and his blue eyes shone with\na kind of desperate earnestness.\n\n\"But I tell you, the world is going to have the truth about War.  We're\ngoing to put an end to this madness.  It's not going to be easy.  Just\nnow, in the intoxication of the German collapse, we're all rejoicing in\nour new happiness.  I tell you, the real Peace will be a long time\ncoming.  When you tear up all the fibres of civilization it's a slow\njob to knit things together again.  You see those children going down\nthe street to school?  Peace lies in their hands.  When they are taught\nin school that war is the most loathsome scourge humanity is subject\nto, that it smirches and fouls every lovely occupation of the mortal\nspirit, then there may be some hope for the future.  But I'd like to\nbet they are having it drilled into them that war is a glorious and\nnoble sacrifice.\n\n\"The people who write poems about the divine frenzy of going over the\ntop are usually those who dipped their pens a long, long way from the\nslimy duckboards of the trenches.  It's funny how we hate to face\nrealities.  I knew a commuter once who rode in town every day on the\n8.13.  But he used to call it the 7.73.  He said it made him feel more\nvirtuous.\"\n\nThere was a pause, while Roger watched some belated urchins hurrying\ntoward school.\n\n\"I think any man would be a traitor to humanity who didn't pledge every\neffort of his waking life to an attempt to make war impossible in\nfuture.\"\n\n\"Surely no one would deny that,\" said Titania.  \"But I do think the war\nwas very glorious as well as very terrible.  I've known lots of men who\nwent over, knowing well what they were to face, and yet went gladly and\nhumbly in the thought they were going for a true cause.\"\n\n\"A cause which is so true shouldn't need the sacrifice of millions of\nfine lives,\" said Roger gravely.  \"Don't imagine I don't see the\ndreadful nobility of it.  But poor humanity shouldn't be asked to be\nnoble at such a cost.  That's the most pitiful tragedy of it all.\nDon't you suppose the Germans thought they too were marching off for a\nnoble cause when they began it and forced this misery on the world?\nThey had been educated to believe so, for a generation.  That's the\nterrible hypnotism of war, the brute mass-impulse, the pride and\nnational spirit, the instinctive simplicity of men that makes them\nworship what is their own above everything else.  I've thrilled and\nshouted with patriotic pride, like everyone.  Music and flags and men\nmarching in step have bewitched me, as they do all of us.  And then\nI've gone home and sworn to root this evil instinct out of my soul.\nGod help us--let's love the world, love humanity--not just our own\ncountry!  That's why I'm so keen about the part we're going to play at\nthe Peace Conference.  Our motto over there will be America Last!\nHurrah for us, I say, for we shall be the only nation over there with\nabsolutely no axe to grind.  Nothing but a pax to grind!\"\n\nIt argued well for Titania's breadth of mind that she was not dismayed\nnor alarmed at the poor bookseller's anguished harangue.  She surmised\nsagely that he was cleansing his bosom of much perilous stuff.  In some\nmysterious way she had learned the greatest and rarest of the spirit's\ngifts--toleration.\n\n\"You can't help loving your country,\" she said.\n\n\"Let's go indoors,\" he answered.  \"You'll catch cold out here.  I want\nto show you my alcove of books on the war.\"\n\n\"Of course one can't help loving one's country,\" he added.  \"I love\nmine so much that I want to see her take the lead in making a new era\npossible.  She has sacrificed least for war, she should be ready to\nsacrifice most for peace.  As for me,\" he said, smiling, \"I'd be\nwilling to sacrifice the whole Republican party!\"\n\n\"I don't see why you call the war an absurdity,\" said Titania.  \"We HAD\nto beat Germany, or where would civilization have been?\"\n\n\"We had to beat Germany, yes, but the absurdity lies in the fact that\nwe had to beat ourselves in doing it.  The first thing you'll find,\nwhen the Peace Conference gets to work, will be that we shall have to\nhelp Germany onto her feet again so that she can be punished in an\norderly way.  We shall have to feed her and admit her to commerce so\nthat she can pay her indemnities--we shall have to police her cities to\nprevent revolution from burning her up--and the upshot of it all will\nbe that men will have fought the most terrible war in history, and\nendured nameless horrors, for the privilege of nursing their enemy back\nto health.  If that isn't an absurdity, what is?  That's what happens\nwhen a great nation like Germany goes insane.\n\n\"Well, we're up against some terribly complicated problems.  My only\nconsolation is that I think the bookseller can play as useful a part as\nany man in rebuilding the world's sanity.  When I was fretting over\nwhat I could do to help things along, I came across two lines in my\nfavourite poet that encouraged me.  Good old George Herbert says:\n\n\n            A grain of glory mixed with humblenesse\n            Cures both a fever and lethargicknesse.\n\n\n\"Certainly running a second-hand bookstore is a pretty humble calling,\nbut I've mixed a grain of glory with it, in my own imagination at any\nrate.  You see, books contain the thoughts and dreams of men, their\nhopes and strivings and all their immortal parts.  It's in books that\nmost of us learn how splendidly worth-while life is.  I never realized\nthe greatness of the human spirit, the indomitable grandeur of man's\nmind, until I read Milton's Areopagitica.  To read that great outburst\nof splendid anger ennobles the meanest of us simply because we belong\nto the same species of animal as Milton.  Books are the immortality of\nthe race, the father and mother of most that is worth while cherishing\nin our hearts.  To spread good books about, to sow them on fertile\nminds, to propagate understanding and a carefulness of life and beauty,\nisn't that high enough mission for a man?  The bookseller is the real\nMr. Valiant-For-Truth.\n\n\"Here's my War-alcove,\" he went on.  \"I've stacked up here most of the\nreally good books the War has brought out.  If humanity has sense\nenough to take these books to heart, it will never get itself into this\nmess again.  Printer's ink has been running a race against gunpowder\nthese many, many years.  Ink is handicapped, in a way, because you can\nblow up a man with gunpowder in half a second, while it may take twenty\nyears to blow him up with a book.  But the gunpowder destroys itself\nalong with its victim, while a book can keep on exploding for\ncenturies.  There's Hardy's Dynasts for example.  When you read that\nbook you can feel it blowing up your mind.  It leaves you gasping, ill,\nnauseated--oh, it's not pleasant to feel some really pure intellect\nfiltered into one's brain!  It hurts!  There's enough T. N. T. in that\nbook to blast war from the face of the globe.  But there's a slow fuse\nattached to it.  It hasn't really exploded yet.  Maybe it won't for\nanother fifty years.\n\n\"In regard to the War, think what books have accomplished.  What was\nthe first thing all the governments started to do--publish books!  Blue\nBooks, Yellow Books, White Books, Red Books--everything but Black\nBooks, which would have been appropriate in Berlin.  They knew that\nguns and troops were helpless unless they could get the books on their\nside, too.  Books did as much as anything else to bring America into\nthe war.  Some German books helped to wipe the Kaiser off his throne--I\nAccuse, and Dr. Muehlon's magnificent outburst The Vandal of Europe,\nand Lichnowsky's private memorandum, that shook Germany to her\nfoundations, simply because he told the truth.  Here's that book Men in\nWar, written I believe by a Hungarian officer, with its noble\ndedication \"To Friend and Foe.\"  Here are some of the French\nbooks--books in which the clear, passionate intellect of that race,\nwith its savage irony, burns like a flame.  Romain Rolland's Au-Dessus\nde la Melee, written in exile in Switzerland; Barbusse's terrible Le\nFeu; Duhamel's bitter Civilization; Bourget's strangely fascinating\nnovel The Meaning of Death.  And the noble books that have come out of\nEngland:  A Student in Arms; The Tree of Heaven; Why Men Fight, by\nBertrand Russell--I'm hoping he'll write one on Why Men Are Imprisoned:\nyou know he was locked up for his sentiments!  And here's one of the\nmost moving of all--The Letters of Arthur Heath, a gentle, sensitive\nyoung Oxford tutor who was killed on the Western front.  You ought to\nread that book.  It shows the entire lack of hatred on the part of the\nEnglish.  Heath and his friends, the night before they enlisted, sat up\nsinging the German music they had loved, as a kind of farewell to the\nold, friendly joyous life.  Yes, that's the kind of thing War\ndoes--wipes out spirits like Arthur Heath.  Please read it.  Then\nyou'll have to read Philip Gibbs, and Lowes Dickinson and all the young\npoets.  Of course you've read Wells already.  Everybody has.\"\n\n\"How about the Americans?\" said Titania.  \"Haven't they written\nanything about the war that's worth while?\"\n\n\"Here's one that I found a lot of meat in, streaked with philosophical\ngristle,\" said Roger, relighting his pipe.  He pulled out a copy of\nProfessor Latimer's Progress.  \"There was one passage that I remember\nmarking--let's see now, what was it?--Yes, here!\n\n\n\"It is true that, if you made a poll of newspaper editors, you might\nfind a great many who think that war is evil.  But if you were to take\na census among pastors of fashionable metropolitan churches--\"\n\n\n\"That's a bullseye hit!  The church has done for itself with most\nthinking men. . . . There's another good passage in Professor Latimer,\nwhere he points out the philosophical value of dishwashing.  Some of\nLatimer's talk is so much in common with my ideas that I've been rather\nhoping he'd drop in here some day.  I'd like to meet him.  As for\nAmerican poets, get wise to Edwin Robinson----\"\n\nThere is no knowing how long the bookseller's monologue might have\ncontinued, but at this moment Helen appeared from the kitchen.\n\n\"Good gracious, Roger!\" she exclaimed, \"I've heard your voice piping\naway for I don't know how long.  What are you doing, giving the poor\nchild a Chautauqua lecture?  You must want to frighten her out of the\nbook business.\"\n\nRoger looked a little sheepish.  \"My dear,\" he said, \"I was only laying\ndown a few of the principles underlying the art of bookselling----\"\n\n\"It was very interesting, honestly it was,\" said Titania brightly.\nMrs. Mifflin, in a blue check apron and with plump arms floury to the\nelbow, gave her a wink--or as near a wink as a woman ever achieves (ask\nthe man who owns one).\n\n\"Whenever Mr. Mifflin feels very low in his mind about the business,\"\nshe said, \"he falls back on those highly idealized sentiments.  He\nknows that next to being a parson, he's got into the worst line there\nis, and he tries bravely to conceal it from himself.\"\n\n\"I think it's too bad to give me away before Miss Titania,\" said Roger,\nsmiling, so Titania saw this was merely a family joke.\n\n\"Really truly,\" she protested, \"I'm having a lovely time.  I've been\nlearning all about Professor Latimer who wrote The Handle of Europe,\nand all sorts of things.  I've been afraid every minute that some\ncustomer would come in and interrupt us.\"\n\n\"No fear of that,\" said Helen.  \"They're scarce in the early morning.\"\nShe went back to her kitchen.\n\n\"Well, Miss Titania,\" resumed Roger.  \"You see what I'm driving at.  I\nwant to give people an entirely new idea about bookshops.  The grain of\nglory that I hope will cure both my fever and my lethargicness is my\nconception of the bookstore as a power-house, a radiating place for\ntruth and beauty.  I insist books are not absolutely dead things: they\nare as lively as those fabulous dragons' teeth, and being sown up and\ndown, may chance to spring up armed men.  How about Bernhardi?  Some of\nmy Corn Cob friends tell me books are just merchandise.  Pshaw!\"\n\n\"I haven't read much of Bernard Shaw\" said Titania.\n\n\"Did you ever notice how books track you down and hunt you out?  They\nfollow you like the hound in Francis Thompson's poem.  They know their\nquarry!  Look at that book The Education of Henry Adams!  Just watch\nthe way it's hounding out thinking people this winter.  And The Four\nHorsemen--you can see it racing in the veins of the reading people.\nIt's one of the uncanniest things I know to watch a real book on its\ncareer--it follows you and follows you and drives you into a corner and\nMAKES you read it.  There's a queer old book that's been chasing me for\nyears: The Life and Opinions of John Buncle, Esq., it's called.  I've\ntried to escape it, but every now and then it sticks up its head\nsomewhere.  It'll get me some day, and I'll be compelled to read it.\nTen Thousand a Year trailed me the same way until I surrendered.  Words\ncan't describe the cunning of some books.  You'll think you've shaken\nthem off your trail, and then one day some innocent-looking customer\nwill pop in and begin to talk, and you'll know he's an unconscious\nagent of book-destiny.  There's an old sea-captain who drops in here\nnow and then.  He's simply the novels of Captain Marryat put into\nflesh.  He has me under a kind of spell; I know I shall have to read\nPeter Simple before I die, just because the old fellow loves it so.\nThat's why I call this place the Haunted Bookshop.  Haunted by the\nghosts of the books I haven't read.  Poor uneasy spirits, they walk and\nwalk around me.  There's only one way to lay the ghost of a book, and\nthat is to read it.\"\n\n\"I know what you mean,\" said Titania.  \"I haven't read much Bernard\nShaw, but I feel I shall have to.  He meets me at every turn, bullying\nme.  And I know lots of people who are simply terrorized by H. G.\nWells.  Every time one of his books comes out, and that's pretty often,\nthey're in a perfect panic until they've read it.\"\n\nRoger chuckled.  \"Some have even been stampeded into subscribing to the\nNew Republic for that very purpose.\"\n\n\"But speaking of the Haunted Bookshop, what's your special interest in\nthat Oliver Cromwell book?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm glad you mentioned it,\" said Roger.  \"I must put it back in\nits place on the shelf.\"  He ran back to the den to get it, and just\nthen the bell clanged at the door.  A customer came in, and the\none-sided gossip was over for the time being.\n\n\n\nChapter VII\n\nAubrey Takes Lodgings\n\n\nI am sensible that Mr. Aubrey Gilbert is by no means ideal as the\nleading juvenile of our piece.  The time still demands some explanation\nwhy the leading juvenile wears no gold chevrons on his left sleeve.  As\na matter of fact, our young servant of the Grey-Matter Agency had been\ndeclined by a recruiting station and a draft board on account of flat\nfeet; although I must protest that their flatness detracts not at all\nfrom his outward bearing nor from his physical capacity in the ordinary\nconcerns of amiable youth.  When the army \"turned him down flat,\" as he\nput it, he had entered the service of the Committee on Public\nInformation, and had carried on mysterious activities in their behalf\nfor over a year, up to the time when the armistice was signed by the\nUnited Press.  Owing to a small error of judgment on his part, now\ncompletely forgotten, but due to the regrettable delay of the German\nenvoys to synchronize with over-exuberant press correspondents, the\nlast three days of the war had been carried on without his active\nassistance.  After the natural recuperation necessary on the 12th of\nNovember, he had been re-absorbed by the Grey-Matter Advertising\nAgency, with whom he had been connected for several years, and where\nhis sound and vivacious qualities were highly esteemed.  It was in the\ncourse of drumming up post-war business that he had swung so far out of\nhis ordinary orbit as to call on Roger Mifflin.  Perhaps these\nexplanations should have been made earlier.\n\nAt any rate, Aubrey woke that Saturday morning, about the time Titania\nbegan to dust the pavement-boxes, in no very world-conquering humour.\nAs it was a half-holiday, he felt no compunction in staying away from\nthe office.  The landlady, a motherly soul, sent him up some coffee and\nscrambled eggs, and insisted on having a doctor in to look at his\ndamage.  Several stitches were taken, after which he had a nap.  He\nwoke up at noon, feeling better, though his head still ached\nabominably.  Putting on a dressing gown, he sat down in his modest\nchamber, which was furnished chiefly with a pipe-rack, ash trays, and a\nset of O. Henry, and picked up one of his favourite volumes for a bit\nof solace.  We have hinted that Mr. Gilbert was not what is called\n\"literary.\" His reading was mostly of the newsstand sort, and Printer's\nInk, that naive journal of the publicity professions.  His favourite\ndiversion was luncheon at the Advertising Club where he would pore,\nfascinated, over displays of advertising booklets, posters, and\npamphlets with such titles as Tell Your Story in Bold-Face.  He was\naccustomed to remark that \"the fellow who writes the Packard ads has\nRalph Waldo Emerson skinned three ways from the Jack.\" Yet much must be\nforgiven this young man for his love of O. Henry.  He knew, what many\nother happy souls have found, that O. Henry is one of those rare and\ngifted tellers of tales who can be read at all times.  No matter how\nweary, how depressed, how shaken in morale, one can always find\nenjoyment in that master romancer of the Cabarabian Nights.  \"Don't\ntalk to me of Dickens' Christmas Stories,\" Aubrey said to himself,\nrecalling his adventure in Brooklyn.  \"I'll bet O. Henry's Gift of the\nMagi beats anything Dick ever laid pen to.  What a shame he died\nwithout finishing that Christmas story in Rolling Stones!  I wish some\nboss writer like Irvin Cobb or Edna Ferber would take a hand at\nfinishing it.  If I were an editor I'd hire someone to wind up that\nyarn.  It's a crime to have a good story like that lying around half\nwritten.\"\n\nHe was sitting in a soft wreath of cigarette smoke when his landlady\ncame in with the morning paper.\n\n\"Thought you might like to see the Times, Mr. Gilbert,\" she said.  \"I\nknew you'd been too sick to go out and buy one.  I see the President's\ngoing to sail on Wednesday.\"\n\nAubrey threaded his way through the news with the practiced eye of one\nwho knows what interests him.  Then, by force of habit, he carefully\nscanned the advertising pages.  A notice in the HELP WANTED columns\nleaped out at him.\n\n\nWANTED--For temporary employment at Hotel Octagon, 3 chefs, 5\nexperienced cooks, 20 waiters.  Apply chef's office, 11 P.M. Tuesday.\n\n\n\"Hum,\" he thought.  \"I suppose, to take the place of those fellows who\nare going to sail on the George Washington to cook for Mr. Wilson.\nThat's a grand ad for the Octagon, having their kitchen staff chosen\nfor the President's trip.  Gee, I wonder why they don't play that up in\nsome real space?  Maybe I can place some copy for them along that line.\"\n\nAn idea suddenly occurred to him, and he went over to the chair where\nhe had thrown his overcoat the night before.  From the pocket he took\nout the cover of Carlyle's Cromwell, and looked at it carefully.\n\n\"I wonder what the jinx is on this book?\" he thought.  \"It's a queer\nthing the way that fellow trailed me last night--then my finding this\nin the drug store, and getting that crack on the bean.  I wonder if\nthat neighbourhood is a safe place for a girl to work in?\"\n\nHe paced up and down the room, forgetting the pain in his head.\n\n\"Maybe I ought to tip the police off about this business,\" he thought.\n\"It looks wrong to me.  But I have a hankering to work the thing out on\nmy own.  I'd have a wonderful stand-in with old man Chapman if I saved\nthat girl from anything. . . . I've heard of gangs of kidnappers. . . .\nNo, I don't like the looks of things a little bit.  I think that\nbookseller is half cracked, anyway.  He doesn't believe in advertising!\nThe idea of Chapman trusting his daughter in a place like that----\"\n\nThe thought of playing knight errant to something more personal and\nromantic than an advertising account was irresistible.  \"I'll slip over\nto Brooklyn as soon as it gets dark this evening,\" he said to himself.\n\"I ought to be able to get a room somewhere along that street, where I\ncan watch that bookshop without being seen, and find out what's\nhaunting it.  I've got that old .22 popgun of mine that I used to use\nup at camp.  I'll take it along.  I'd like to know more about\nWeintraub's drug store, too.  I didn't fancy the map of Herr Weintraub,\nnot at all.  To tell the truth, I had no idea old man Carlyle would get\nmixed up in anything as interesting as this.\"\n\nHe found a romantic exhilaration in packing a handbag.  Pyjamas,\nhairbrushes, toothbrush, toothpaste--(\"What an ad it would be for the\nChinese Paste people,\" he thought, \"if they knew I was taking a tube of\ntheir stuff on this adventure!\")--his .22 revolver, a small green box\nof cartridges of the size commonly used for squirrel-shooting, a volume\nof O. Henry, a safety razor and adjuncts, a pad of writing paper. . . .\nAt least six nationally advertised articles, he said to himself,\nenumerating his kit.  He locked his bag, dressed, and went downstairs\nfor lunch.  After lunch he lay down for a rest, as his head was still\nvery painful.  But he was not able to sleep.  The thought of Titania\nChapman's blue eyes and gallant little figure came between him and\nslumber.  He could not shake off the conviction that some peril was\nhanging over her.  Again and again he looked at his watch, rebuking the\nlagging dusk.  At half-past four he set off for the subway.  Half-way\ndown Thirty-third Street a thought struck him.  He returned to his\nroom, got out a pair of opera glasses from his trunk, and put them in\nhis bag.\n\nIt was blue twilight when he reached Gissing Street.  The block between\nWordsworth Avenue and Hazlitt Street is peculiar in that on one\nside--the side where the Haunted Bookshop stands--the old brownstone\ndwellings have mostly been replaced by small shops of a bright, lively\ncharacter.  At the Wordsworth Avenue corner, where the L swings round\nin a lofty roaring curve, stands Weintraub's drug store; below it, on\nthe western side, a succession of shining windows beacon through the\nevening.  Delicatessen shops with their appetizing medley of cooked and\npickled meats, dried fruits, cheeses, and bright coloured jars of\npreserves; small modistes with generously contoured wax busts of\ncoiffured ladies; lunch rooms with the day's menu typed and pasted on\nthe outer pane; a French rotisserie where chickens turn hissing on the\nspits before a tall oven of rosy coals; florists, tobacconists,\nfruit-dealers, and a Greek candy-shop with a long soda fountain shining\nwith onyx marble and coloured glass lamps and nickel tanks of hot\nchocolate; a stationery shop, now stuffed for the holiday trade with\nChristmas cards, toys, calendars, and those queer little suede-bound\nvolumes of Kipling, Service, Oscar Wilde, and Omar Khayyam that appear\nevery year toward Christmas time--such modest and cheerful\nmerchandising makes the western pavement of Gissing Street a jolly\nplace when the lights are lit.  All the shops were decorated for the\nChristmas trade; the Christmas issues of the magazines were just out\nand brightened the newsstands with their glowing covers.  This section\nof Brooklyn has a tone and atmosphere peculiarly French in some parts:\none can quite imagine oneself in some smaller Parisian boulevard\nfrequented by the petit bourgeois.  Midway in this engaging and\nanimated block stands the Haunted Bookshop.  Aubrey could see its\nwindows lit, and the shelved masses of books within.  He felt a severe\ntemptation to enter, but a certain bashfulness added itself to his\ndesire to act in secret.  There was a privy exhilaration in his plan of\nputting the bookshop under an unsuspected surveillance, and he had the\nemotion of one walking on the frontiers of adventure.\n\nSo he kept on the opposite side of the street, which still maintains an\nunbroken row of quiet brown fronts, save for the movie theatre at the\nupper corner, opposite Weintraub's.  Some of the basements on this side\nare occupied now by small tailors, laundries, and lace-curtain cleaners\n(lace curtains are still a fetish in Brooklyn), but most of the houses\nare still merely dwellings.  Carrying his bag, Aubrey passed the bright\nhalo of the movie theatre.  Posters announcing THE RETURN OF TARZAN\nshowed a kind of third chapter of Genesis scene with an Eve in a sports\nsuit.  ADDED ATTRACTION, Mr. AND Mrs. SIDNEY DREW, he read.\n\nA little way down the block he saw a sign VACANCIES in a parlour\nwindow.  The house was nearly opposite the bookshop, and he at once\nmounted the tall steps to the front door and rang.\n\nA fawn-tinted coloured girl, of the kind generally called \"Addie,\"\narrived presently.  \"Can I get a room here?\" he asked.  \"I don't know,\nyou'd better see Miz' Schiller,\" she said, without rancour.  Adopting\nthe customary compromise of untrained domestics, she did not invite him\ninside, but departed, leaving the door open to show that there was no\nill will.\n\nAubrey stepped into the hall and closed the door behind him.  In an\nimmense mirror the pale cheese-coloured flutter of a gas jet was\nremotely reflected.  He noticed the Landseer engraving hung against\nwallpaper designed in facsimile of large rectangles of gray stone, and\nthe usual telephone memorandum for the usual Mrs. J. F. Smith (who\nabides in all lodging houses) tucked into the frame of the mirror.\nWill Mrs. Smith please call Stockton 6771, it said.  A carpeted stair\nwith a fine old mahogany balustrade rose into the dimness.  Aubrey, who\nwas thoroughly familiar with lodgings, knew instinctively that the\nfourth, ninth, tenth, and fourteenth steps would be creakers.  A soft\nmusk sweetened the warm, torpid air: he divined that someone was\ntoasting marshmallows over a gas jet.  He knew perfectly well that\nsomewhere in the house would be a placard over a bathtub with the\nlegend:  Please leave this tub as you would wish to find it.  Roger\nMifflin would have said, after studying the hall, that someone in the\nhouse was sure to be reading the poems of Rabbi Tagore; but Aubrey was\nnot so caustic.\n\nMrs. Schiller came up the basement stairs, followed by a small pug dog.\nShe was warm and stout, with a tendency to burst just under the\narmpits.  She was friendly.  The pug made merry over Aubrey's ankles.\n\n\"Stop it, Treasure!\" said Mrs. Schiller.\n\n\"Can I get a room here?\" asked Aubrey, with great politeness.\n\n\"Third floor front's the only thing I've got,\" she said.  \"You don't\nsmoke in bed, do you?  The last young man I had burned holes in three\nof my sheets----\"\n\nAubrey reassured her.\n\n\"I don't give meals.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" said Aubrey.  \"Suits me.\"\n\n\"Five dollars a week,\" she said.\n\n\"May I see it?\"\n\nMrs. Schiller brightened the gas and led the way upstairs.  Treasure\nskipped up the treads beside her.  The sight of the six feet ascending\ntogether amused Aubrey.  The fourth, ninth, tenth, and fourteenth steps\ncreaked, as he had guessed they would.  On the landing of the second\nstorey a transom gushed orange light.  Mrs. Schiller was secretly\npleased at not having to augment the gas on that landing.  Under the\ntransom and behind a door Aubrey could hear someone having a bath, with\na great sloshing of water.  He wondered irreverently whether it was\nMrs. J. F. Smith.  At any rate (he felt sure), it was some experienced\nhabitue of lodgings, who knew that about five-thirty in the afternoon\nis the best time for a bath--before cooking supper and the homecoming\nablutions of other tenants have exhausted the hot water boiler.\n\nThey climbed one more flight.  The room was small, occupying half the\nthird-floor frontage.  A large window opened onto the street, giving a\nplain view of the bookshop and the other houses across the way.  A\nwash-stand stood modestly inside a large cupboard.  Over the mantel was\nthe familiar picture--usually, however, reserved for the fourth floor\nback--of a young lady having her shoes shined by a ribald small boy.\n\nAubrey was delighted.  \"This is fine,\" he said.  \"Here's a week in\nadvance.\"\n\nMrs. Schiller was almost disconcerted by the rapidity of the\ntransaction.  She preferred to solemnize the reception of a new lodger\nby a little more talk--remarks about the weather, the difficulty of\ngetting \"help,\" the young women guests who empty tea-leaves down\nwash-basin pipes, and so on.  All this sort of gossip, apparently\naimless, has a very real purpose:  it enables the defenceless landlady\nto size up the stranger who comes to prey upon her.  She had hardly had\na good look at this gentleman, nor even knew his name, and here he had\npaid a week's rent and was already installed.\n\nAubrey divined the cause of her hesitation, and gave her his business\ncard.\n\n\"All right, Mr. Gilbert,\" she said.  \"I'll send up the girl with some\nclean towels and a latchkey.\"\n\nAubrey sat down in a rocking chair by the window, tucked the muslin\ncurtain to one side, and looked out upon the bright channel of Gissing\nStreet.  He was full of the exhilaration that springs from any change\nof abode, but his romantic satisfaction in being so close to the\nadorable Titania was somewhat marred by a sense of absurdity, which is\nfeared by young men more than wounds and death.  He could see the\nlighted windows of the Haunted Bookshop quite plainly, but he could not\nthink of any adequate excuse for going over there.  And already he\nrealized that to be near Miss Chapman was not at all the consolation he\nhad expected it would be.  He had a powerful desire to see her.  He\nturned off the gas, lit his pipe, opened the window, and focussed the\nopera glasses on the door of the bookshop.  It brought the place\ntantalizingly near.  He could see the table at the front of the shop,\nRoger's bulletin board under the electric light, and one or two\nnondescript customers gleaning along the shelves.  Then something\nbounded violently under the third button of his shirt.  There she was!\nIn the bright, prismatic little circle of the lenses he could see\nTitania.  Heavenly creature, in her white V-necked blouse and brown\nskirt, there she was looking at a book.  He saw her put out one arm and\ncaught the twinkle of her wrist-watch.  In the startling familiarity of\nthe magnifying glass he could see her bright, unconscious face, the\nmerry profile of her cheek and chin. . . . \"The idea of that girl\nworking in a second-hand bookstore!\" he exclaimed.  \"It's positive\nsacrilege!  Old man Chapman must be crazy.\"\n\nHe took out his pyjamas and threw them on the bed; put his toothbrush\nand razor on the wash-basin, laid hairbrushes and O. Henry on the\nbureau.  Feeling rather serio-comic he loaded his small revolver and\nhipped it.  It was six o'clock, and he wound his watch.  He was a\nlittle uncertain what to do:  whether to keep a vigil at the window\nwith the opera glasses, or go down in the street where he could watch\nthe bookshop more nearly.  In the excitement of the adventure he had\nforgotten all about the cut on his scalp, and felt quite chipper.  In\nleaving Madison Avenue he had attempted to excuse the preposterousness\nof his excursion by thinking that a quiet week-end in Brooklyn would\ngive him an opportunity to jot down some tentative ideas for Daintybits\nadvertising copy which he planned to submit to his chief on Monday.\nBut now that he was here he felt the impossibility of attacking any\nsuch humdrum task.  How could he sit down in cold blood to devise any\n\"attention-compelling\" lay-outs for Daintybits Tapioca and Chapman's\nCherished Saratoga Chips, when the daintiest bit of all was only a few\nyards away?  For the first time was made plain to him the amazing power\nof young women to interfere with the legitimate commerce of the world.\nHe did get so far as to take out his pad of writing paper and jot down\n\n\n            CHAPMAN'S CHERISHED CHIPS\n\n\nThese delicate wafers, crisped by a secret process, cherish in their\nunique tang and flavour all the life-giving nutriment that has made the\npotato the King of Vegetables----\n\n\nBut the face of Miss Titania kept coming between his hand and brain.\nOf what avail to flood the world with Chapman Chips if the girl herself\nshould come to any harm? \"Was this the face that launched a thousand\nchips?\" he murmured, and for an instant wished he had brought The\nOxford Book of English Verse instead of O. Henry.\n\nA tap sounded at his door, and Mrs. Schiller appeared.  \"Telephone for\nyou, Mr. Gilbert,\" she said.\n\n\"For ME?\" said Aubrey in amazement.  How could it be for him, he\nthought, for no one knew he was there.\n\n\"The party on the wire asked to speak to the gentleman who arrived\nabout half an hour ago, and I guess you must be the one he means.\"\n\n\"Did he say who he is?\" asked Aubrey.\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\nFor a moment Aubrey thought of refusing to answer the call.  Then it\noccurred to him that this would arouse Mrs. Schiller's suspicions.  He\nran down to the telephone, which stood under the stairs in the front\nhall.\n\n\"Hello,\" he said.\n\n\"Is this the new guest?\" said a voice--a deep, gargling kind of voice.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Aubrey.\n\n\"Is this the gentleman that arrived half an hour ago with a handbag?\"\n\n\"Yes; who are you?\"\n\n\"I'm a friend,\" said the voice; \"I wish you well.\"\n\n\"How do you do, friend and well-wisher,\" said Aubrey genially.\n\n\"I schust want to warn you that Gissing Street is not healthy for you,\"\nsaid the voice.\n\n\"Is that so?\" said Aubrey sharply.  \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I am a friend,\" buzzed the receiver.  There was a harsh, bass note in\nthe voice that made the diaphragm at Aubrey's ear vibrate tinnily.\nAubrey grew angry.\n\n\"Well, Herr Freund,\" he said, \"if you're the well-wisher I met on the\nBridge last night, watch your step.  I've got your number.\"\n\nThere was a pause.  Then the other repeated, ponderously, \"I am a\nfriend.  Gissing Street is not healthy for you.\"  There was a click,\nand he had rung off.\n\nAubrey was a good deal perplexed.  He returned to his room, and sat in\nthe dark by the window, smoking a pipe and thinking, with his eyes on\nthe bookshop.\n\nThere was no longer any doubt in his mind that something sinister was\nafoot.  He reviewed in memory the events of the past few days.\n\nIt was on Monday that a bookloving friend had first told him of the\nexistence of the shop on Gissing Street.  On Tuesday evening he had\ngone round to visit the place, and had stayed to supper with Mr.\nMifflin.  On Wednesday and Thursday he had been busy at the office, and\nthe idea of an intensive Daintybit campaign in Brooklyn had occurred to\nhim.  On Friday he had dined with Mr. Chapman, and had run into a\ncurious string of coincidences.  He tabulated them:--\n\n(1) The Lost ad in the Times on Friday morning.\n\n(2) The chef in the elevator carrying the book that was supposed to be\nlost--he being the same man Aubrey had seen in the bookshop on Tuesday\nevening.\n\n(3) Seeing the chef again on Gissing Street.\n\n(4) The return of the book to the bookshop.\n\n(5) Mifflin had said that the book had been stolen from him.  Then why\nshould it be either advertised or returned?\n\n(6) The rebinding of the book.\n\n(7) Finding the original cover of the book in Weintraub's drug store.\n\n(8) The affair on the Bridge.\n\n(9) The telephone message from \"a friend\"--a friend with an obviously\nTeutonic voice.\n\n\nHe remembered the face of anger and fear displayed by the Octagon chef\nwhen he had spoken to him in the elevator.  Until this oddly menacing\ntelephone message, he could have explained the attack on the Bridge as\nmerely a haphazard foot-pad enterprise; but now he was forced to\nconclude that it was in some way connected with his visits to the\nbookshop.  He felt, too, that in some unknown way Weintraub's drug\nstore had something to do with it.  Would he have been attacked if he\nhad not taken the book cover from the drug store?  He got the cover out\nof his bag and looked at it again.  It was of plain blue cloth, with\nthe title stamped in gold on the back, and at the bottom the lettering\nLondon:  Chapman and Hall.  From the width of the backstrap it was\nevident that the book had been a fat one.  Inside the front cover the\nfigure 60 was written in red pencil--this he took to be Roger Mifflin's\nprice mark.  Inside the back cover he found the following notations--\n\n\n  vol. 3--166, 174, 210, 329, 349\n  329 ff. cf. W. W.\n\n\nThese references were written in black ink, in a small, neat hand.\nBelow them, in quite a different script and in pale violet ink, was\nwritten\n\n\n153 (3) 1, 2\n\n\n\"I suppose these are page numbers,\" Aubrey thought.  \"I think I'd\nbetter have a look at that book.\"\n\nHe put the cover in his pocket and went out for a bite of supper.\n\"It's a puzzle with three sides to it,\" he thought, as he descended the\ncrepitant stairs, \"The Bookshop, the Octagon, and Weintraub's; but that\nbook seems to be the clue to the whole business.\"\n\n\n\nChapter VIII\n\nAubrey Goes to the Movies, and Wishes he Knew More German\n\n\nA few doors from the bookshop was a small lunchroom named after the\ngreat city of Milwaukee, one of those pleasant refectories where the\ndiner buys his food at the counter and eats it sitting in a flat-armed\nchair.  Aubrey got a bowl of soup, a cup of coffee, beef stew, and bran\nmuffins, and took them to an empty seat by the window.  He ate with one\neye on the street.  From his place in the corner he could command the\nstrip of pavement in front of Mifflin's shop.  Halfway through the stew\nhe saw Roger come out onto the pavement and begin to remove the books\nfrom the boxes.\n\nAfter finishing his supper he lit one of his \"mild but they satisfy\"\ncigarettes and sat in the comfortable warmth of a near-by radiator.  A\nlarge black cat lay sprawled on the next chair.  Up at the service\ncounter there was a pleasant clank of stout crockery as occasional\ncustomers came in and ordered their victuals.  Aubrey began to feel a\nrelaxation swim through his veins.  Gissing Street was very bright and\norderly in its Saturday evening bustle.  Certainly it was grotesque to\nimagine melodrama hanging about a second-hand bookshop in Brooklyn.\nThe revolver felt absurdly lumpy and uncomfortable in his hip pocket.\nWhat a different aspect a little hot supper gives to affairs!  The most\nresolute idealist or assassin had better write his poems or plan his\natrocities before the evening meal.  After the narcosis of that repast\nthe spirit falls into a softer mood, eager only to be amused.  Even\nMilton would hardly have had the inhuman fortitude to sit down to the\nmanuscript of Paradise Lost right after supper.  Aubrey began to wonder\nif his unpleasant suspicions had not been overdrawn.  He thought how\ndelightful it would be to stop in at the bookshop and ask Titania to go\nto the movies with him.\n\nCurious magic of thought!  The idea was still sparkling in his mind\nwhen he saw Titania and Mrs. Mifflin emerge from the bookshop and pass\nbriskly in front of the lunchroom.  They were talking and laughing\nmerrily.  Titania's face, shining with young vitality, seemed to him\nmore \"attention-compelling\" than any ten-point Caslon type-arrangement\nhe had ever seen.  He admired the layout of her face from the\nstandpoint of his cherished technique.  \"Just enough 'white space,'\" he\nthought, \"to set off her eyes as the 'centre of interest.' Her features\naren't this modern bold-face stuff, set solid,\" he said to himself,\nthinking typographically.  \"They're rather French old-style italic,\nslightly leaded.  Set on 22-point body, I guess.  Old man Chapman's a\npretty good typefounder, you have to hand it to him.\"\n\nHe smiled at this conceit, seized hat and coat, and dashed out of the\nlunchroom.\n\nMrs. Mifflin and Titania had halted a few yards up the street, and were\nlooking at some pert little bonnets in a window.  Aubrey hurried across\nthe street, ran up to the next corner, recrossed, and walked down the\neastern pavement.  In this way he would meet them as though he were\ncoming from the subway.  He felt rather more excited than King Albert\nre-entering Brussels.  He saw them coming, chattering together in the\ndelightful fashion of women out on a spree.  Helen seemed much younger\nin the company of her companion.  \"A lining of pussy-willow taffeta and\nan embroidered slip-on,\" she was saying.\n\nAubrey steered onto them with an admirable gesture of surprise.\n\n\"Well, I never!\" said Mrs. Mifflin.  \"Here's Mr. Gilbert.  Were you\ncoming to see Roger?\" she added, rather enjoying the young man's\npredicament.\n\nTitania shook hands cordially.  Aubrey, searching the old-style italics\nwith the desperate intensity of a proof-reader, saw no evidence of\nchagrin at seeing him again so soon.\n\n\"Why,\" he said rather lamely, \"I was coming to see you all.  I--I\nwondered how you were getting along.\"\n\nMrs. Mifflin had pity on him.  \"We've left Mr. Mifflin to look after\nthe shop,\" she said.  \"He's busy with some of his old crony customers.\nWhy don't you come with us to the movies?\"\n\n\"Yes, do,\" said Titania.  \"It's Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Drew, you know how\nadorable they are!\"\n\nNo one needs to be told how quickly Aubrey assented.  Pleasure\ncoincided with duty in that the outer wing of the party placed him next\nto Titania.\n\n\"Well, how do you like bookselling?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, it's the greatest fun!\" she cried.  \"But it'll take me ever and\never so long to learn about all the books.  People ask such questions!\nA woman came in this afternoon looking for a copy of Blase Tales.  How\nwas I to know she wanted The Blazed Trail?\"\n\n\"You'll get used to that,\" said Mrs. Mifflin.  \"Just a minute, people,\nI want to stop in at the drug store.\"\n\nThey went into Weintraub's pharmacy.  Entranced as he was by the\nproximity of Miss Chapman, Aubrey noticed that the druggist eyed him\nrather queerly.  And being of a noticing habit, he also observed that\nwhen Weintraub had occasion to write out a label for a box of powdered\nalum Mrs. Mifflin was buying, he did so with a pale violet ink.\n\nAt the glass sentry-box in front of the theatre Aubrey insisted on\nbuying the tickets.\n\n\"We came out right after supper,\" said Titania as they entered, \"so as\nto get in before the crowd.\"\n\nIt is not so easy, however, to get ahead of Brooklyn movie fans.  They\nhad to stand for several minutes in a packed lobby while a stern young\nman held the waiting crowd in check with a velvet rope.  Aubrey\nsustained delightful spasms of the protective instinct in trying to\nshelter Titania from buffets and pushings.  Unknown to her, his arm\nextended behind her like an iron rod to absorb the onward impulses of\nthe eager throng.  A rustling groan ran through these enthusiasts as\nthey saw the preliminary footage of the great Tarzan flash onto the\nscreen, and realized they were missing something.  At last, however,\nthe trio got through the barrier and found three seats well in front,\nat one side.  From this angle the flying pictures were strangely\ndistorted, but Aubrey did not mind.\n\n\"Isn't it lucky I got here when I did,\" whispered Titania.  \"Mr.\nMifflin has just had a telephone call from Philadelphia asking him to\ngo over on Monday to make an estimate on a library that's going to be\nsold so I'll be able to look after the shop for him while he's gone.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" said Aubrey.  \"Well, now, I've got to be in Brooklyn on\nMonday, on business.  Maybe Mrs. Mifflin would let me come in and buy\nsome books from you.\"\n\n\"Customers always welcome,\" said Mrs. Mifflin.\n\n\"I've taken a fancy to that Cromwell book,\" said Aubrey.  \"What do you\nsuppose Mr. Mifflin would sell it for?\"\n\n\"I think that book must be valuable,\" said Titania.  \"Somebody came in\nthis afternoon and wanted to buy it, but Mr. Mifflin wouldn't part with\nit.  He says it's one of his favourites.  Gracious, what a weird film\nthis is!\"\n\nThe fantastic absurdities of Tarzan proceeded on the screen, tearing\ncelluloid passions to tatters, but Aubrey found the strong man of the\njungle coming almost too close to his own imperious instincts.  Was not\nhe, too--he thought naively--a poor Tarzan of the advertising jungle,\nlost among the elephants and alligators of commerce, and sighing for\nthis dainty and unattainable vision of girlhood that had burst upon his\nburning gaze!  He stole a perilous side-glance at her profile, and saw\nthe racing flicker of the screen reflected in tiny spangles of light\nthat danced in her eyes.  He was even so unknowing as to imagine that\nshe was not aware of his contemplation.  And then the lights went up.\n\n\"What nonsense, wasn't it?\" said Titania.  \"I'm so glad it's over!  I\nwas quite afraid one of those elephants would walk off the screen and\ntread on us.\"\n\n\"I never can understand,\" said Helen, \"why they don't film some of the\nreally good books--think of Frank Stockton's stuff, how delightful that\nwould be.  Can't you imagine Mr. and Mrs. Drew playing in Rudder\nGrange!\"\n\n\"Thank goodness!\" said Titania.  \"Since I entered the book business,\nthat's the first time anybody's mentioned a book that I've read.\nYes--do you remember when Pomona and Jonas visit an insane asylum on\ntheir honeymoon?  Do you know, you and Mr. Mifflin remind me a little\nof Mr. and Mrs. Drew.\"\n\nHelen and Aubrey chuckled at this innocent correlation of ideas.  Then\nthe organ began to play \"O How I Hate To Get Up in the Morning\" and the\never-delightful Mr. and Mrs. Drew appeared on the screen in one of\ntheir domestic comedies.  Lovers of the movies may well date a new\nscreen era from the day those whimsical pantomimers set their wholesome\nand humane talent at the service of the arc light and the lens.  Aubrey\nfelt a serene and intimate pleasure in watching them from a seat beside\nTitania.  He knew that the breakfast table scene shadowed before them\nwas only a makeshift section of lath propped up in some barnlike motion\npicture studio; yet his rocketing fancy imagined it as some arcadian\nsuburb where he and Titania, by a jugglery of benign fate, were\nbungalowed together.  Young men have a pioneering imagination: it is\ndoubtful whether any young Orlando ever found himself side by side with\nRosalind without dreaming himself wedded to her.  If men die a thousand\ndeaths before this mortal coil is shuffled, even so surely do youths\ncontract a thousand marriages before they go to the City Hall for a\nlicense.\n\nAubrey remembered the opera glasses, which were still in his pocket,\nand brought them out.  The trio amused themselves by watching Sidney\nDrew's face through the magnifying lenses.  They were disappointed in\nthe result, however, as the pictures, when so enlarged, revealed all\nthe cobweb of fine cracks on the film.  Mr. Drew's nose, the most\namusing feature known to the movies, lost its quaintness when so\naugmented.\n\n\"Why,\" cried Titania, \"it makes his lovely nose look like the map of\nFlorida.\"\n\n\"How on earth did you happen to have these in your pocket?\" asked Mrs.\nMifflin, returning the glasses.\n\nAubrey was hard pressed for a prompt and reasonable fib, but\nadvertising men are resourceful.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"I sometimes carry them with me at night to study the\nadvertising sky-signs.  I'm a little short sighted.  You see, it's part\nof my business to study the technique of the electric signs.\"\n\nAfter some current event pictures the programme prepared to repeat\nitself, and they went out.  \"Will you come in and have some cocoa with\nus?\" said Helen as they reached the door of the bookshop.  Aubrey was\neager enough to accept, but feared to overplay his hand.  \"I'm sorry,\"\nhe said, \"but I think I'd better not.  I've got some work to do\nto-night.  Perhaps I can drop in on Monday when Mr. Mifflin's away, and\nput coal on the furnace for you, or something of that sort?\"\n\nMrs. Mifflin laughed.  \"Surely!\" she said.  \"You're welcome any time.\"\nThe door closed behind them, and Aubrey fell into a profound\nmelancholy.  Deprived of the heavenly rhetoric of her eye, Gissing\nStreet seemed flat and dull.\n\nIt was still early--not quite ten o'clock--and it occurred to Aubrey\nthat if he was going to patrol the neighbourhood he had better fix its\ndetails in his head.  Hazlitt, the next street below the bookshop,\nproved to be a quiet little byway, cheerfully lit with modest\ndwellings.  A few paces down Hazlitt Street a narrow cobbled alley ran\nthrough to Wordsworth Avenue, passing between the back yards of Gissing\nStreet and Whittier Street.  The alley was totally dark, but by\ncounting off the correct number of houses Aubrey identified the rear\nentrance of the bookshop.  He tried the yard gate cautiously, and found\nit unlocked.  Glancing in he could see a light in the kitchen window\nand assumed that the cocoa was being brewed.  Then a window glowed\nupstairs, and he was thrilled to see Titania shining in the lamplight.\nShe moved to the window and pulled down the blind.  For a moment he saw\nher head and shoulders silhouetted against the curtain; then the light\nwent out.\n\nAubrey stood briefly in sentimental thought.  If he only had a couple\nof blankets, he mused, he could camp out here in Roger's back yard all\nnight.  Surely no harm could come to the girl while he kept watch\nbeneath her casement!  The idea was just fantastic enough to appeal to\nhim.  Then, as he stood in the open gateway, he heard distant footfalls\ncoming down the alley, and a grumble of voices.  Perhaps two policemen\non their rounds, he thought:  it would be awkward to be surprised\nskulking about back doors at this time of night.  He slipped inside the\ngate and closed it gently behind him, taking the precaution to slip the\nbolt.\n\nThe footsteps came nearer, stumbling down the uneven cobbles in the\ndarkness.  He stood still against the back fence.  To his amazement the\nmen halted outside Mifflin's gate, and he heard the latch quietly\nlifted.\n\n\"It's no use,\" said a voice--\"the gate is locked.  We must find some\nother way, my friend.\"\n\nAubrey tingled to hear the rolling, throaty \"r\" in the last word.\nThere was no mistaking--this was the voice of his \"friend and\nwell-wisher\" over the telephone.\n\nThe other said something in German in a hoarse whisper.  Having studied\nthat language in college, Aubrey caught only two words--Thur and\nSchlussel, which he knew meant door and key.\n\n\"Very well,\" said the first voice.  \"That will be all right, but we\nmust act to-night. The damned thing must be finished to-morrow.  Your\nidiotic stupidity--\"\n\nAgain followed some gargling in German, in a rapid undertone too fluent\nfor Aubrey's grasp.  The latch of the alley gate clicked once more, and\nhis hand was on his revolver; but in a moment the two had passed on\ndown the alley.\n\nThe young advertising agent stood against the fence in silent horror,\nhis heart bumping heavily.  His hands were clammy, his feet seemed to\nhave grown larger and taken root.  What damnable complot was this?  A\nsultry wave of anger passed over him.  This bland, slick, talkative\nbookseller, was he arranging some blackmailing scheme to kidnap the\ngirl and wring blood-money out of her father?  And in league with\nGermans, too, the scoundrel!  What an asinine thing for old Chapman to\nsend an unprotected girl over here into the wilds of Brooklyn . . . and\nin the meantime, what was he to do?  Patrol the back yard all night?\nNo, the friend and well-wisher had said \"We must find some other way.\"\nBesides, Aubrey remembered something having been said about the old\nterrier sleeping in the kitchen.  He felt sure Bock would not let any\nGerman in at night without raising the roof.  Probably the best way\nwould be to watch the front of the shop.  In miserable perplexity he\nwaited several minutes until the two Germans would be well out of\nearshot.  Then he unbolted the gate and stole up the alley on tiptoe,\nin the opposite direction.  It led into Wordsworth Avenue just behind\nWeintraub's drug store, over the rear of which hung the great girders\nand trestles of the \"L\" station, a kind of Swiss chalet straddling the\nstreet on stilts.  He thought it prudent to make a detour, so he turned\neast on Wordsworth Avenue until he reached Whittier Street, then\nsauntered easily down Whittier for a block, spying sharply for\nevidences of pursuit.  Brooklyn was putting out its lights for the\nnight, and all was quiet.  He turned into Hazlitt Street and so back\nonto Gissing, noticing now that the Haunted Bookshop lights were off.\nIt was nearly eleven o'clock: the last audience was filing out of the\nmovie theatre, where two workmen were already perched on ladders taking\ndown the Tarzan electric light sign, to substitute the illuminated\nlettering for the next feature.\n\nAfter some debate he decided that the best thing to do was to return to\nhis room at Mrs. Schiller's, from which he could keep a sharp watch on\nthe front door of the bookshop.  By good fortune there was a lamp post\nalmost directly in front of Mifflin's house, which cast plenty of light\non the little sunken area before the door.  With his opera glasses he\ncould see from his bedroom whatever went on.  As he crossed the street\nhe cast his eyes upward at the facade of Mrs. Schiller's house.  Two\nwindows in the fourth storey were lit, and the gas burned minutely in\nthe downstairs hall, elsewhere all was dark.  And then, as he glanced\nat the window of his own chamber, where the curtain was still tucked\nback behind the pane, he noticed a curious thing.  A small point of\nrosy light glowed, faded, and glowed again by the window.  Someone was\nsmoking a cigar in his room.\n\nAubrey continued walking in even stride, as though he had seen nothing.\nReturning down the street, on the opposite side, he verified his first\nglance.  The light was still there, and he judged himself not far out\nin assuming the smoker to be the friend and well-wisher or one of his\ngang.  He had suspected the other man in the alley of being Weintraub,\nbut he could not be sure.  A cautious glance through the window of the\ndrug store revealed Weintraub at his prescription counter.  Aubrey\ndetermined to get even with the guttural gentleman who was waiting for\nhim, certainly with no affectionate intent.  He thanked the good\nfortune that had led him to stick the book cover in his overcoat pocket\nwhen leaving Mrs. Schiller's.  Evidently, for reasons unknown, someone\nwas very anxious to get hold of it.\n\nAn idea occurred to him as he passed the little florist's shop, which\nwas just closing.  He entered and bought a dozen white carnations, and\nthen, as if by an afterthought, asked \"Have you any wire?\"\n\nThe florist produced a spool of the slender, tough wire that is\nsometimes used to nip the buds of expensive roses, to prevent them from\nblossoming too quickly.\n\n\"Let me have about eight feet,\" said Aubrey.  \"I need some to-night and\nI guess the hardware stores are all closed.\"\n\nWith this he returned to Mrs. Schiller's, picking his way carefully and\nclose to the houses so as to be out of sight from the upstairs windows.\nHe climbed the steps and unlatched the door with bated breath.  It was\nhalf-past eleven, and he wondered how long he would have to wait for\nthe well-wisher to descend.\n\nHe could not help chuckling as he made his preparations, remembering an\noccasion at college somewhat similar in setting though far less serious\nin purpose.  First he took off his shoes, laying them carefully to one\nside where he could find them again in a hurry.  Then, choosing a\nbanister about six feet from the bottom of the stairs he attached one\nend of the wire tightly to its base and spread the slack in a large\nloop over two of the stair treads.  The remaining end of the wire he\npassed out through the banisters, twisting it into a small loop so that\nhe could pull it easily.  Then he turned out the hall gas and sat down\nin the dark to wait events.\n\nHe sat for a long time, in some nervousness lest the pug dog might come\nprowling and find him.  He was startled by a lady in a dressing\ngown--perhaps Mrs. J. F. Smith--who emerged from a ground-floor room\npassed very close to him in the dark, and muttered upstairs.  He\ntwitched his noose out of the way just in time.  Presently, however,\nhis patience was rewarded.  He heard a door squeak above, and then the\ngroaning of the staircase as someone descended slowly.  He relaid his\ntrap and waited, smiling to himself.  A clock somewhere in the house\nwas chiming twelve as the man came groping down the last flight,\nfeeling his way in the dark.  Aubrey heard him swearing under his\nbreath.\n\nAt the precise moment, when both his victim's feet were within the\nloop, Aubrey gave the wire a gigantic tug.  The man fell like a safe,\ncrashing against the banisters and landing in a sprawl on the floor.\nIt was a terrific fall, and shook the house.  He lay there groaning and\ncursing.\n\nBarely retaining his laughter, Aubrey struck a match and held it over\nthe sprawling figure.  The man lay with his face twisted against one\nout-spread arm, but the beard was unmistakable.  It was the assistant\nchef again, and he seemed partly unconscious.  \"Burnt hair is a grand\nrestorative,\" said Aubrey to himself, and applied the match to the bush\nof beard.  He singed off a couple of inches of it with intense delight,\nand laid his carnations on the head of the stricken one.  Then, hearing\nstirrings in the basement, he gathered up his wire and shoes and fled\nupstairs.  He gained his room roaring with inward mirth, but entered\ncautiously, fearing some trap.  Save for a strong tincture of cigar\nsmoke, everything seemed correct.  Listening at his door he heard Mrs.\nSchiller exclaiming shrilly in the hall, assisted by yappings from the\npug.  Doors upstairs were opened, and questions were called out.  He\nheard guttural groans from the bearded one, mingled with oaths and some\nangry remark about having fallen downstairs.  The pug, frenzied with\nexcitement, yelled insanely.  A female voice--possibly Mrs. J. F.\nSmith--cried out \"What's that smell of burning?\" Someone else said,\n\"They're burning feathers under his nose to bring him to.\"\n\n\"Yes, Hun's feathers,\" chuckled Aubrey to himself.  He locked his door,\nand sat down by the window with his opera glasses.\n\n\n\nChapter IX\n\nAgain the Narrative is Retarded\n\n\nRoger had spent a quiet evening in the bookshop.  Sitting at his desk\nunder a fog of tobacco, he had honestly intended to do some writing on\nthe twelfth chapter of his great work on bookselling.  This chapter was\nto be an (alas, entirely conjectural) \"Address Delivered by a\nBookseller on Being Conferred the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Letters\nby a Leading University,\" and it presented so many alluring\npossibilities that Roger's mind always wandered from the paper into\nentranced visions of his imagined scene.  He loved to build up in fancy\nthe flattering details of that fine ceremony when bookselling would at\nlast be properly recognized as one of the learned professions.  He\ncould see the great auditorium, filled with cultivated people:  men\nwith Emersonian profiles, ladies whispering behind their fluttering\nprogrammes.  He could see the academic beadle, proctor, dean (or\nwhatever he is, Roger was a little doubtful) pronouncing the august\nwords of presentation--\n\n\nA man who, in season and out of season, forgetting private gain for\npublic weal, has laboured with Promethean and sacrificial ardour to\ninstil the love of reasonable letters into countless thousands; to\nwhom, and to whose colleagues, amid the perishable caducity of human\naffairs, is largely due the pullulation of literary taste; in honouring\nwhom we seek to honour the noble and self-effacing profession of which\nhe is so representative a member----\n\n\nThen he could see the modest bookseller, somewhat clammy in his\nextremities and lost within his academic robe and hood, nervously\nfidgeting his mortar-board, haled forward by ushers, and tottering\nrubescent before the chancellor, provost, president (or whoever it\nmight be) who hands out the diploma.  Then (in Roger's vision) he could\nsee the garlanded bibliopole turning to the expectant audience, giving\nhis trailing gown a deft rearward kick as the ladies do on the stage,\nand uttering, without hesitation or embarrassment, with due\ninterpolation of graceful pleasantry, that learned and unlaboured\ndiscourse on the delights of bookishness that he had often dreamed of.\nThen he could see the ensuing reception:  the distinguished savants\ncrowding round; the plates of macaroons, the cups of untasted tea; the\nladies twittering, \"Now there's something I want to ask you--why are\nthere so many statues to generals, admirals, parsons, doctors,\nstatesmen, scientists, artists, and authors, but no statues to\nbooksellers?\"\n\nContemplation of this glittering scene always lured Roger into\nfantastic dreams.  Ever since he had travelled country roads, some\nyears before, selling books from a van drawn by a fat white horse, he\nhad nourished a secret hope of some day founding a Parnassus on Wheels\nCorporation which would own a fleet of these vans and send them out\ninto the rural byways where bookstores are unknown.  He loved to\nimagine a great map of New York State, with the daily location of each\ntravelling Parnassus marked by a coloured pin.  He dreamed of himself,\nsitting in some vast central warehouse of second-hand books, poring\nover his map like a military chief of staff and forwarding cases of\nliterary ammunition to various bases where his vans would re-stock.\nHis idea was that his travelling salesmen could be recruited largely\nfrom college professors, parsons, and newspaper men, who were weary of\ntheir thankless tasks, and would welcome an opportunity to get out on\nthe road.  One of his hopes was that he might interest Mr. Chapman in\nthis superb scheme, and he had a vision of the day when the shares of\nthe Parnassus on Wheels Corporation would pay a handsome dividend and\nbe much sought after by serious investors.\n\nThese thoughts turned his mind toward his brother-in-law Andrew McGill,\nthe author of several engaging books on the joys of country living, who\ndwells at the Sabine Farm in the green elbow of a Connecticut valley.\nThe original Parnassus, a quaint old blue wagon in which Roger had\nlived and journeyed and sold books over several thousand miles of\ncountry roads in the days before his marriage, was now housed in\nAndrew's barn.  Peg, his fat white horse, had lodging there also.  It\noccurred to Roger that he owed Andrew a letter, and putting aside his\nnotes for the bookseller's collegiate oration, he began to write:\n\n\n                         THE HAUNTED BOOKSHOP\n                         163 Gissing Street, Brooklyn,\n                         November 30, 1918.\n\nMY DEAR ANDREW:\n\nIt is scandalous not to have thanked you sooner for the annual cask of\ncider, which has given us even more than the customary pleasure.  This\nhas been an autumn when I have been hard put to it to keep up with my\nown thoughts, and I've written no letters at all.  Like everyone else I\nam thinking constantly of this new peace that has marvellously come\nupon us.  I trust we may have statesmen who will be able to turn it to\nthe benefit of humanity.  I wish there could be an international peace\nconference of booksellers, for (you will smile at this) my own\nconviction is that the future happiness of the world depends in no\nsmall measure on them and on the librarians.  I wonder what a German\nbookseller is like?\n\nI've been reading The Education of Henry Adams and wish he might have\nlived long enough to give us his thoughts on the War.  I fear it would\nhave bowled him over.  He thought that this is not a world \"that\nsensitive and timid natures can regard without a shudder.\" What would\nhe have said of the four-year shambles we have watched with sickened\nhearts?\n\nYou remember my favourite poem--old George Herbert's Church\nPorch--where he says--\n\n\n     By all means use sometimes to be alone;\n          Salute thyself; see what thy soul doth wear;\n     Dare to look in thy chest, for 'tis thine own,\n          And tumble up and down what thou find'st there--\n\n\nWell, I've been tumbling my thoughts up and down a good deal.\nMelancholy, I suppose, is the curse of the thinking classes; but I\nconfess my soul wears a great uneasiness these days!  The sudden and\namazing turnover in human affairs, dramatic beyond anything in history,\nalready seems to be taken as a matter of course.  My great fear is that\nhumanity will forget the atrocious sufferings of the war, which have\nnever been told.  I am hoping and praying that men like Philip Gibbs\nmay tell us what they really saw.\n\nYou will not agree with me on what I am about to say, for I know you as\na stubborn Republican; but I thank fortune that Wilson is going to the\nPeace Conference.  I've been mulling over one of my favourite books--it\nlies beside me as I write--Cromwell's Letters and Speeches, edited by\nCarlyle, with what Carlyle amusingly calls \"Elucidations.\" (Carlyle is\nnot very good at \"elucidating\" anything!) I have heard somewhere or\nother that this is one of Wilson's favourite books, and indeed, there\nis much of the Cromwell in him.  With what a grim, covenanting zeal he\ntook up the sword when at last it was forced into his hand!  And I have\nbeen thinking that what he will say to the Peace Conference will smack\nstrongly of what old Oliver used to say to Parliament in 1657 and\n1658--\"If we will have Peace without a worm in it, lay we foundations\nof Justice and Righteousness.\" What makes Wilson so irritating to the\nunthoughtful is that he operates exclusively upon reason, not upon\npassion.  He contradicts Kipling's famous lines, which apply to most\nmen--\n\n\n     Very rarely will he squarely push the logic of a fact\n     To its ultimate conclusion in unmitigated act.\n\nIn this instance, I think, Reason is going to win.  I feel the whole\ncurrent of the world setting in that direction.\n\nIt's quaint to think of old Woodrow, a kind of Cromwell-Wordsworth,\ngoing over to do his bit among the diplomatic shell-craters.  What I'm\nwaiting for is the day when he'll get back into private life and write\na book about it.  There's a job, if you like, for a man who might\nreasonably be supposed to be pretty tired in body and soul!  When that\nbook comes out I'll spend the rest of my life in selling it.  I ask\nnothing better!  Speaking of Wordsworth, I've often wondered whether\nWoodrow hasn't got some poems concealed somewhere among his papers!\nI've always imagined that he may have written poems on the sly.  And by\nthe way, you needn't make fun of me for being so devoted to George\nHerbert.  Do you realize that two of the most familiar quotations in\nour language come from his pen, viz.:\n\n\n     Wouldst thou both eat thy cake, and have it?\n\n\nand\n\n\n     Dare to be true: nothing can need a ly;\n     A fault, which needs it most, grows two thereby.\n\n\nForgive this tedious sermon!  My mind has been so tumbled up and down\nthis autumn that I am in a queer state of mingled melancholy and\nexaltation.  You know how much I live in and for books.  Well, I have a\ncurious feeling, a kind of premonition that there are great books\ncoming out of this welter of human hopes and anguishes, perhaps A book\nin which the tempest-shaken soul of the race will speak out as it never\nhas before.  The Bible, you know, is rather a disappointment: it has\nnever done for humanity what it should have done.  I wonder why?  Walt\nWhitman is going to do a great deal, but he is not quite what I mean.\nThere is something coming--I don't know just what!  I thank God I am a\nbookseller, trafficking in the dreams and beauties and curiosities of\nhumanity rather than some mere huckster of merchandise.  But how\nhelpless we all are when we try to tell what goes on within us!  I\nfound this in one of Lafcadio Hearn's letters the other day--I marked\nthe passage for you\n\n\nBaudelaire has a touching poem about an albatross, which you would\nlike--describing the poet's soul superb in its own free azure--but\nhelpless, insulted, ugly, clumsy when striving to walk on common\nearth--or rather, on a deck, where sailors torment it with tobacco\npipes, etc.\n\n\nYou can imagine what evenings I have here among my shelves, now the\nlong dark nights are come!  Of course until ten o'clock, when I shut up\nshop, I am constantly interrupted--as I have been during this letter,\nonce to sell a copy of Helen's Babies and once to sell The Ballad of\nReading Gaol, so you can see how varied are my clients' tastes!  But\nlater on, after we have had our evening cocoa and Helen has gone to\nbed, I prowl about the place, dipping into this and that, fuddling\nmyself with speculation.  How clear and bright the stream of the mind\nflows in those late hours, after all the sediment and floating trash of\nthe day has drained off!  Sometimes I seem to coast the very shore of\nBeauty or Truth, and hear the surf breaking on those shining sands.\nThen some offshore wind of weariness or prejudice bears me away again.\nHave you ever come across Andreyev's Confessions of a Little Man During\nGreat Days?  One of the honest books of the War.  The Little Man ends\nhis confession thus--\n\n\nMy anger has left me, my sadness returned, and once more the tears\nflow.  Whom can I curse, whom can I judge, when we are all alike\nunfortunate?  Suffering is universal; hands are outstretched to each\nother, and when they touch . . . the great solution will come.  My\nheart is aglow, and I stretch out my hand and cry, \"Come, let us join\nhands!  I love you, I love you!\"\n\nAnd of course, as soon as one puts one's self in that frame of mind\nsomeone comes along and picks your pocket. . . . I suppose we must\nteach ourselves to be too proud to mind having our pockets picked!\n\nDid it ever occur to you that the world is really governed by BOOKS?\nThe course of this country in the War, for instance, has been largely\ndetermined by the books Wilson has read since he first began to think!\nIf we could have a list of the principal books he has read since the\nWar began, how interesting it would be.\n\nHere's something I'm just copying out to put up on my bulletin board\nfor my customers to ponder.  It was written by Charles Sorley, a young\nEnglishman who was killed in France in 1915.  He was only twenty years\nold--\n\n\n                           TO GERMANY\n\n\n  You are blind like us.  Your hurt no man designed,\n  And no man claimed the conquest of your land.\n  But gropers both through fields of thought confined\n  We stumble and we do not understand.\n  You only saw your future bigly planned,\n  And we, the tapering paths of our own mind,\n  And in each other's dearest ways we stand,\n  And hiss and hate.  And the blind fight the blind.\n\n  When it is peace, then we may view again\n  With new-won eyes each other's truer form\n  And wonder.  Grown more loving-kind and warm\n  We'll grasp firm hands and laugh at the old pain,\n  When it is peace.  But until peace, the storm\n  The darkness and the thunder and the rain.\n\n\nIsn't that noble?  You see what I am dumbly groping for--some way of\nthinking about the War that will make it seem (to future ages) a\npurification for humanity rather than a mere blackness of stinking\ncinders and tortured flesh and men shot to ribbons in marshes of blood\nand sewage.  Out of such unspeakable desolation men MUST rise to some\nnew conception of national neighbourhood.  I hear so much apprehension\nthat Germany won't be punished sufficiently for her crime.  But how can\nany punishment be devised or imposed for such a huge panorama of\nsorrow?  I think she has already punished herself horribly, and will\ncontinue to do so.  My prayer is that what we have gone through will\nstartle the world into some new realization of the sanctity of\nlife--all life, animal as well as human.  Don't you find that a visit\nto a zoo can humble and astound you with all that amazing and grotesque\nvariety of living energy?\n\nWhat is it that we find in every form of life?  Desire of some\nsort--some unexplained motive power that impels even the smallest\ninsect on its queer travels.  You must have watched some infinitesimal\nred spider on a fence rail, bustling along--why and whither?  Who\nknows?  And when you come to man, what a chaos of hungers and impulses\nkeep thrusting him through his cycle of quaint tasks!  And in every\nhuman heart you find some sorrow, some frustration, some lurking pang.\nI often think of Lafcadio Hearn's story of his Japanese cook.  Hearn\nwas talking of the Japanese habit of not showing their emotions on\ntheir faces.  His cook was a smiling, healthy, agreeable-looking young\nfellow whose face was always cheerful.  Then one day, by chance, Hearn\nhappened to look through a hole in the wall and saw his cook alone.\nHis face was not the same face.  It was thin and drawn and showed\nstrange lines worn by old hardships or sufferings.  Hearn thought to\nhimself, \"He will look just like that when he is dead.\" He went into\nthe kitchen to see him, and instantly the cook was all changed, young\nand happy again.  Never again did Hearn see that face of trouble; but\nhe knew the man wore it when he was alone.\n\nDon't you think there is a kind of parable there for the race as a\nwhole?  Have you ever met a man without wondering what shining sorrows\nhe hides from the world, what contrast between vision and\naccomplishment torments him?  Behind every smiling mask is there not\nsome cryptic grimace of pain?  Henry Adams puts it tersely.  He says\nthe human mind appears suddenly and inexplicably out of some unknown\nand unimaginable void.  It passes half its known life in the mental\nchaos of sleep.  Even when awake it is a victim of its own\nill-adjustment, of disease, of age, of external suggestion, of nature's\ncompulsions; it doubts its own sensations and trusts only in\ninstruments and averages.  After sixty years or so of growing\nastonishment the mind wakes to find itself looking blankly into the\nvoid of death.  And, as Adams says, that it should profess itself\npleased by this performance is all that the highest rules of good\nbreeding can ask.  That the mind should actually be satisfied would\nprove that it exists only as idiocy!\n\nI hope that you will write to tell me along what curves your mind is\nmoving.  For my own part I feel that we are on the verge of amazing\nthings.  Long ago I fell back on books as the only permanent consolers.\nThey are the one stainless and unimpeachable achievement of the human\nrace.  It saddens me to think that I shall have to die with thousands\nof books unread that would have given me noble and unblemished\nhappiness.  I will tell you a secret.  I have never read King Lear, and\nhave purposely refrained from doing so.  If I were ever very ill I\nwould only need to say to myself \"You can't die yet, you haven't read\nLear.\"  That would bring me round, I know it would.\n\nYou see, books are the answer to all our perplexities!  Henry Adams\ngrinds his teeth at his inability to understand the universe.  The best\nhe can do is to suggest a \"law of acceleration,\" which seems to mean\nthat Nature is hustling man along at an ever-increasing rate so that he\nwill either solve all her problems or else die of fever in the effort.\nBut Adams' candid portrait of a mind grappling helplessly with its\nriddles is so triumphantly delightful that one forgets the futility of\nthe struggle in the accuracy of the picture.  Man is unconquerable\nbecause he can make even his helplessness so entertaining.  His motto\nseems to be \"Even though He slay me, yet will I make fun of Him!\"\n\nYes, books are man's supreme triumph, for they gather up and transmit\nall other triumphs.  As Walter de la Mare writes, \"How\nuncomprehendingly must an angel from heaven smile on a poor human\nsitting engrossed in a romance: angled upon his hams, motionless in his\nchair, spectacles on nose, his two feet as close together as the flukes\nof a merman's tail, only his strange eyes stirring in his time-worn\nface.\"\n\nWell, I've been scribbling away all this time and haven't given you any\nnews whatever.  Helen came back the other day from a visit to Boston\nwhere she enjoyed herself greatly.  To-night she has gone out to the\nmovies with a young protegee of ours, Miss Titania Chapman, an engaging\ndamsel whom we have taken in as an apprentice bookseller.  It's a\nquaint idea, done at the request of her father, Mr. Chapman, the\nproprietor of Chapman's Daintybits which you see advertised everywhere.\nHe is a great booklover, and is very eager to have the zeal transmitted\nto his daughter.  So you can imagine my glee to have a neophyte of my\nown to preach books at!  Also it will enable me to get away from the\nshop a little more.  I had a telephone call from Philadelphia this\nafternoon asking me to go over there on Monday evening to make an\nestimate of the value of a private collection that is to be sold.  I\nwas rather flattered because I can't imagine how they got hold of my\nname.\n\nForgive this long, incoherent scrawl.  How did you like Erewhon?  It's\npretty near closing time and I must say grace over the day's accounts.\n\nYours ever,\n  ROGER MIFFLIN.\n\n\n\nChapter X\n\nRoger Raids the Ice-Box\n\n\nRoger had just put Carlyle's Cromwell back in its proper place in the\nHistory alcove when Helen and Titania returned from the movies.  Bock,\nwho had been dozing under his master's chair, rose politely and wagged\na deferential tail.\n\n\"I do think Bock has the darlingest manners,\" said Titania.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Helen, \"it's really a marvel that his wagging muscles\naren't all worn out, he has abused them so.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Roger, \"did you have a good time?\"\n\n\"An adorable time!\" cried Titania, with a face and voice so sparkling\nthat two musty habitues of the shop popped their heads out of the\nalcoves marked ESSAYS and THEOLOGY and peered in amazement.  One of\nthese even went so far as to purchase the copy of Leigh Hunt's Wishing\nCap Papers he had been munching through, in order to have an excuse to\napproach the group and satisfy his bewildered eyes.  When Miss Chapman\ntook the book and wrapped it up for him, his astonishment was made\ncomplete.\n\nUnconscious that she was actually creating business, Titania resumed.\n\n\"We met your friend Mr. Gilbert on the street,\" she said, \"and he went\nto the movies with us.  He says he's coming in on Monday to fix the\nfurnace while you're away.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Roger, \"these advertising agencies are certainly\nenterprising, aren't they?  Think of sending a man over to attend to my\nfurnace, just on the slim chance of getting my advertising account.\"\n\n\"Did you have a quiet evening?\" said Helen.\n\n\"I spent most of the time writing to Andrew,\" said Roger.  \"One amusing\nthing happened, though.  I actually sold that copy of Philip Dru.\"\n\n\"No!\" cried Helen.\n\n\"A fact,\" said Roger.  \"A man was looking at it, and I told him it was\nsupposed to be written by Colonel House.  He insisted on buying it.\nBut what a sell when he tries to read it!\"\n\n\"Did Colonel House really write it?\" asked Titania.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Roger.  \"I hope not, because I find in myself a\nsecret tendency to believe that Mr. House is an able man.  If he did\nwrite it, I devoutly hope none of the foreign statesmen in Paris will\nlearn of that fact.\"\n\nWhile Helen and Titania took off their wraps, Roger was busy closing up\nthe shop.  He went down to the corner with Bock to mail his letter, and\nwhen he returned to the den Helen had prepared a large jug of cocoa.\nThey sat down by the fire to enjoy it.\n\n\"Chesterton has written a very savage poem against cocoa,\" said Roger,\n\"which you will find in The Flying Inn; but for my part I find it the\nideal evening drink.  It lets the mind down gently, and paves the way\nfor slumber.  I have often noticed that the most terrific philosophical\nagonies can be allayed by three cups of Mrs. Mifflin's cocoa.  A man\ncan safely read Schopenhauer all evening if he has a tablespoonful of\ncocoa and a tin of condensed milk available.  Of course it should be\nmade with condensed milk, which is the only way.\"\n\n\"I had no idea anything could be so good,\" said Titania.  \"Of course,\nDaddy makes condensed milk in one of his factories, but I never dreamed\nof trying it.  I thought it was only used by explorers, people at the\nNorth Pole, you know.\"\n\n\"How stupid of me!\" exclaimed Roger.  \"I quite forgot to tell you!\nYour father called up just after you had gone out this evening, and\nwanted to know how you were getting on.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear,\" said Titania.  \"He must have been delighted to hear I was\nat the movies, on the second day of my first job!  He probably said it\nwas just like me.\"\n\n\"I explained that I had insisted on your going with Mrs. Mifflin,\nbecause I felt she needed the change.\"\n\n\"I do hope,\" said Titania, \"you won't let Daddy poison your mind about\nme.  He thinks I'm dreadfully frivolous, just because I LOOK frivolous.\nBut I'm so keen to make good in this job.  I've been practicing doing\nup parcels all afternoon, so as to learn how to tie the string nicely\nand not cut it until after the knot's tied.  I found that when you cut\nit beforehand either you get it too short and it won't go round, or\nelse too long and you waste some.  Also I've learned how to make\nwrapping paper cuffs to keep my sleeves clean.\"\n\n\"Well, I haven't finished yet,\" continued Roger.  \"Your father wants us\nall to spend to-morrow out at your home.  He wants to show us some\nbooks he has just bought, and besides he thinks maybe you're feeling\nhomesick.\"\n\n\"What, with all these lovely books to read?  Nonsense!  I don't want to\ngo home for six months!\"\n\n\"He wouldn't take No for an answer.  He's going to send Edwards round\nwith the car the first thing to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"What fun!\" said Helen.  \"It'll be delightful.\"\n\n\"Goodness,\" said Titania.  \"Imagine leaving this adorable bookshop to\nspend Sunday in Larchmont.  Well, I'll be able to get that georgette\nblouse I forgot.\"\n\n\"What time will the car be here?\" asked Helen.\n\n\"Mr. Chapman said about nine o'clock.  He begs us to get out there as\nearly as possible, as he wants to spend the day showing us his books.\"\n\nAs they sat round the fading bed of coals, Roger began hunting along\nhis private shelves.  \"Have you ever read any Gissing?\" he said.\n\nTitania made a pathetic gesture to Mrs. Mifflin.  \"It's awfully\nembarrassing to be asked these things!  No, I never heard of him.\"\n\n\"Well, as the street we live on is named after him, I think you ought\nto,\" he said.  He pulled down his copy of The House of Cobwebs.  \"I'm\ngoing to read you one of the most delightful short stories I know.\nIt's called 'A Charming Family.'\"\n\n\"No, Roger,\" said Mrs. Mifflin firmly.  \"Not to-night.  It's eleven\no'clock, and I can see Titania's tired.  Even Bock has left us and gone\nin to his kennel.  He's got more sense than you have.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the bookseller amiably.  \"Miss Chapman, you take the\nbook up with you and read it in bed if you want to.  Are you a\nlibrocubicularist?\"\n\nTitania looked a little scandalized.\n\n\"It's all right, my dear,\" said Helen.  \"He only means are you fond of\nreading in bed.  I've been waiting to hear him work that word into the\nconversation.  He made it up, and he's immensely proud of it.\"\n\n\"Reading in bed?\" said Titania.  \"What a quaint idea!  Does any one do\nit?  It never occurred to me.  I'm sure when I go to bed I'm far too\nsleepy to think of such a thing.\"\n\n\"Run along then, both of you,\" said Roger.  \"Get your beauty sleep.  I\nshan't be very late.\"\n\nHe meant it when he said it, but returning to his desk at the back of\nthe shop his eye fell upon his private shelf of books which he kept\nthere \"to rectify perturbations\" as Burton puts it.  On this shelf\nthere stood Pilgrim's Progress, Shakespeare, The Anatomy of Melancholy,\nThe Home Book of Verse, George Herbert's Poems, The Notebooks of Samuel\nButler, and Leaves of Grass.  He took down The Anatomy of Melancholy,\nthat most delightful of all books for midnight browsing.  Turning to\none of his favourite passages--\"A Consolatory Digression, Containing\nthe Remedies of All Manner of Discontents\"--he was happily lost to all\nticking of the clock, retaining only such bodily consciousness as was\nneedful to dump, fill, and relight his pipe from time to time.\nSolitude is a dear jewel for men whose days are spent in the tedious\nthis-and-that of trade.  Roger was a glutton for his midnight musings.\nTo such tried companions as Robert Burton and George Herbert he was\nwont to exonerate his spirit.  It used to amuse him to think of Burton,\nthe lonely Oxford scholar, writing that vast book to \"rectify\" his own\nmelancholy.\n\nBy and by, turning over the musty old pages, he came to the following,\non Sleep--\n\n\nThe fittest time is two or three hours after supper, whenas the meat is\nnow settled at the bottom of the stomach, and 'tis good to lie on the\nright side first, because at that site the liver doth rest under the\nstomach, not molesting any way, but heating him as a fire doth a\nkettle, that is put to it.  After the first sleep 'tis not amiss to lie\non the left side, that the meat may the better descend, and sometimes\nagain on the belly, but never on the back.  Seven or eight hours is a\ncompetent time for a melancholy man to rest----\n\n\nIn that case, thought Roger, it's time for me to be turning in.  He\nlooked at his watch, and found it was half-past twelve.  He switched\noff his light and went back to the kitchen quarters to tend the furnace.\n\nI hesitate to touch upon a topic of domestic bitterness, but candor\ncompels me to say that Roger's evening vigils invariably ended at the\nice-box.  There are two theories as to this subject of ice-box\nplundering, one of the husband and the other of the wife.  Husbands are\nprone to think (in their simplicity) that if they take a little of\neverything palatable they find in the refrigerator, but thus\ndistributing their forage over the viands the general effect of the\ndepradation will be almost unnoticeable.  Whereas wives say (and Mrs.\nMifflin had often explained to Roger) that it is far better to take all\nof any one dish than a little of each; for the latter course is likely\nto diminish each item below the bulk at which it is still useful as a\nleft-over.  Roger, however, had the obstinate viciousness of all good\nhusbands, and he knew the delights of cold provender by heart.  Many a\nstewed prune, many a mess of string beans or naked cold boiled potato,\nmany a chicken leg, half apple pie, or sector of rice pudding, had\nperished in these midnight festivals.  He made it a point of honour\nnever to eat quite all of the dish in question, but would pass with\nunabated zest from one to another.  This habit he had sternly repressed\nduring the War, but Mrs. Mifflin had noticed that since the armistice\nhe had resumed it with hearty violence.  This is a custom which causes\nthe housewife to be confronted the next morning with a tragical vista\nof pathetic scraps.  Two slices of beet in a little earthenware cup, a\nsliver of apple pie one inch wide, three prunes lowly nestling in a\nmere trickle of their own syrup, and a tablespoonful of stewed rhubarb\nwhere had been one of those yellow basins nearly full--what can the\nmost resourceful kitcheneer do with these oddments?  This atrocious\npractice cannot be too bitterly condemned.\n\nBut we are what we are, and Roger was even more so.  The Anatomy of\nMelancholy always made him hungry, and he dipped discreetly into\nvarious vessels of refreshment, sharing a few scraps with Bock whose\npleading brown eye at these secret suppers always showed a comical\nrealization of their shameful and furtive nature.  Bock knew very well\nthat Roger had no business at the ice-box, for the larger outlines of\nsocial law upon which every home depends are clearly understood by\ndogs.  But Bock's face always showed his tremulous eagerness to\nparticipate in the sin, and rather than have him stand by as a silent\nand damning critic, Roger used to give him most of the cold potato.\nThe censure of a dog is something no man can stand.  But I rove, as\nBurton would say.\n\nAfter the ice-box, the cellar.  Like all true householders, Roger was\nfond of his cellar.  It was something mouldy of smell, but it harboured\na well-stocked little bin of liquors, and the florid glow of the\nfurnace mouth upon the concrete floor was a great pleasure to the\nbookseller.  He loved to peer in at the dancing flicker of small blue\nflames that played above the ruddy mound of coals in the\nfirebox--tenuous, airy little flames that were as blue as violets and\nhovered up and down in the ascending gases.  Before blackening the fire\nwith a stoking of coal he pulled up a wooden Bushmills box, turned off\nthe electric bulb overhead, and sat there for a final pipe, watching\nthe rosy shine of the grate.  The tobacco smoke, drawn inward by the\nhot inhaling fire, seemed dry and gray in the golden brightness.  Bock,\nwho had pattered down the steps after him, nosed and snooped about the\ncellar.  Roger was thinking of Burton's words on the immortal weed--\n\n\nTobacco, divine, rare, superexcellent tobacco, which goes far beyond\nall the panaceas, potable gold, and philosopher's stones, a sovereign\nremedy to all diseases. . . . a virtuous herb, if it be well qualified,\nopportunely taken, and medicinally used; but as it is commonly abused\nby most men, which take it as tinkers do ale, 'tis a plague, a\nmischief, a violent purger of goods, lands, health, hellish, devilish,\nand damned tobacco, the ruin and overthrow of body and soul----\n\n\nBock was standing on his hind legs, looking up at the front wall of the\ncellar, in which two small iron-grated windows opened onto the sunken\narea by the front door of the shop.  He gave a low growl, and seemed\nuneasy.\n\n\"What is it, Bock?\" said Roger placidly, finishing his pipe.\n\nBock gave a short, sharp bark, with a curious note of protest in it.\nBut Roger's mind was still with Burton.\n\n\"Rats?\" he said.  \"Aye, very likely!  This is Ratisbon, old man, but\ndon't bark about it.  Incident of the French Camp: 'Smiling, the rat\nfell dead.'\"\n\nBock paid no heed to this persiflage, but prowled the front end of the\ncellar, looking upward in curious agitation.  He growled again, softly.\n\n\"Shhh,\" said Roger gently.  \"Never mind the rats, Bock.  Come on, we'll\nstoke up the fire and go to bed.  Lord, it's one o'clock.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XI\n\nTitania Tries Reading in Bed\n\n\nAubrey, sitting at his window with the opera glasses, soon realized\nthat he was blind weary.  Even the exalted heroics of romance are not\nproof against fatigue, most potent enemy of all who do and dream.  He\nhad had a long day, coming after the skull-smiting of the night before;\nit was only the frosty air at the lifted sash that kept him at all\nawake.  He had fallen into a half drowse when he heard footsteps coming\ndown the opposite side of the street.\n\nHe had forced himself awake several times before, to watch the passage\nof some harmless strollers through the innocent blackness of the\nBrooklyn night, but this time it was what he sought.  The man stepped\nstealthily, with a certain blend of wariness and assurance.  He halted\nunder the lamp by the bookshop door, and the glasses gave him enlarged\nto Aubrey's eye.  It was Weintraub, the druggist.\n\nThe front of the bookshop was now entirely dark save for a curious\nlittle glimmer down below the pavement level.  This puzzled Aubrey, but\nhe focussed his glasses on the door of the shop.  He saw Weintraub pull\na key out of his pocket, insert it very carefully in the lock, and open\nthe door stealthily.  Leaving the door ajar behind him, the druggist\nslipped into the shop.\n\n\"What devil's business is this?\" thought Aubrey angrily.  \"The swine\nhas even got a key of his own.  There's no doubt about it.  He and\nMifflin are working together on this job.\"\n\nFor a moment he was uncertain what to do.  Should he run downstairs and\nacross the street?  Then, as he hesitated, he saw a pale beam of light\nover in the front left-hand corner of the shop.  Through the glasses he\ncould see the yellow circle of a flashlight splotched upon dim shelves\nof books.  He saw Weintraub pull a volume out of the case, and the\nlight vanished.  Another instant and the man reappeared in the doorway,\nclosed the door behind him with a gesture of careful silence, and was\noff up the street quietly and swiftly.  It was all over in a minute.\nTwo yellow oblongs shone for a minute or two down in the area\nunderneath the door.  Through the glasses he now made out these patches\nas the cellar windows.  Then they disappeared also, and all was placid\ngloom.  In the quivering light of the street lamps he could see the\nbookseller's sign gleaming whitely, with its lettering THIS SHOP IS\nHAUNTED.\n\nAubrey sat back in his chair.  \"Well,\" he said to himself, \"that guy\ncertainly gave his shop the right name.  This is by me.  I do believe\nit's only some book-stealing game after all.  I wonder if he and\nWeintraub go in for some first-edition faking, or some such stunt as\nthat?  I'd give a lot to know what it's all about.\"\n\nHe stayed by the window on the qui vive, but no sound broke the\nstillness of Gissing Street.  In the distance he could hear the\noccasional rumble of the Elevated trains rasping round the curve on\nWordsworth Avenue.  He wondered whether he ought to go over and break\ninto the shop to see if all was well.  But, like every healthy young\nman, he had a horror of appearing absurd.  Little by little weariness\nnumbed his apprehensions.  Two o'clock clanged and echoed from distant\nsteeples.  He threw off his clothes and crawled into bed.\n\n\nIt was ten o'clock on Sunday morning when he awoke.  A broad swath of\nsunlight cut the room in half:  the white muslin curtain at the window\nrippled outward like a flag.  Aubrey exclaimed when he saw his watch.\nHe had a sudden feeling of having been false to his trust.  What had\nbeen happening across the way?\n\nHe gazed out at the bookshop.  Gissing Street was bright and demure in\nthe crisp quietness of the forenoon.  Mifflin's house showed no sign of\nlife.  It was as he had last seen it, save that broad green shades had\nbeen drawn down inside the big front windows, making it impossible to\nlook through into the book-filled alcoves.\n\nAubrey put on his overcoat in lieu of a dressing gown, and went in\nsearch of a bathtub.  He found the bathroom on his floor locked, with\nsounds of leisurely splashing within.  \"Damn Mrs. J. F. Smith,\" he\nsaid.  He was about to descend to the storey below, bashfully conscious\nof bare feet and pyjamaed shins, but looking over the banisters he saw\nMrs. Schiller and the treasure-dog engaged in some household\nmanoeuvres.  The pug caught sight of his pyjama legs and began to yap.\nAubrey retreated in the irritation of a man baulked of a cold tub.  He\nshaved and dressed rapidly.\n\nOn his way downstairs he met Mrs. Schiller.  He thought that her gaze\nwas disapproving.\n\n\"A gentleman called to see you last night, sir,\" she said.  \"He said he\nwas very sorry to miss you.\"\n\n\"I was rather late in getting in,\" said Aubrey.  \"Did he leave his\nname?\"\n\n\"No, he said he'd see you some other time.  He woke the whole house up\nby falling downstairs,\" she added sourly.\n\nHe left the lodging house swiftly, fearing to be seen from the\nbookshop.  He was very eager to learn if everything was all right, but\nhe did not want the Mifflins to know he was lodging just opposite.\nHastening diagonally across the street, he found that the Milwaukee\nLunch, where he had eaten the night before, was open.  He went in and\nhad breakfast, rejoicing in grapefruit, ham and eggs, coffee, and\ndoughnuts.  He lit a pipe and sat by the window wondering what to do\nnext.  \"It's damned perplexing,\" he said to himself.  \"I stand to lose\neither way.  If I don't do anything, something may happen to the girl;\nif I butt in too soon I'll get in dutch with her.  I wish I knew what\nWeintraub and that chef are up to.\"\n\nThe lunchroom was practically empty, and in two chairs near him the\nproprietor and his assistant were sitting talking.  Aubrey was suddenly\nstruck by what they said.\n\n\"Say, this here, now, bookseller guy must have struck it rich.\"\n\n\"Who, Mifflin?\"\n\n\"Yeh; did ya see that car in front of his place this morning?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Believe me, some boat.\"\n\n\"Musta hired it, hey?  Where'd he go at?\"\n\n\"I didn't see.  I just saw the bus standing front the door.\"\n\n\"Say, did you see that swell dame he's got clerking for him?\"\n\n\"I sure did.  What's he doing, taking her joy-riding?\"\n\n\"Shouldn't wonder.  I wouldn't blame him----\"\n\nAubrey gave no sign of having heard, but got up and left the lunchroom.\nHad the girl been kidnapped while he overslept?  He burned with shame\nto think what a pitiful failure his knight-errantry had been.  His\nfirst idea was to beard Weintraub and compel him to explain his\nconnection with the bookshop.  His next thought was to call up Mr.\nChapman and warn him of what had been going on.  Then he decided it\nwould be futile to do either of these before he really knew what had\nhappened.  He determined to get into the bookshop itself, and burst\nopen its sinister secret.\n\nHe walked hurriedly round to the rear alley, and surveyed the domestic\napartments of the shop.  Two windows in the second storey stood\nslightly open, but he could discern no signs of life.  The back gate\nwas still unlocked, and he walked boldly into the yard.\n\nThe little enclosure was serene in the pale winter sunlight.  Along one\nfence ran a line of bushes and perennials, their roots wrapped in\nstraw.  The grass plot was lumpy, the sod withered to a tawny yellow\nand granulated with a sprinkle of frost.  Below the kitchen door--which\nstood at the head of a flight of steps--was a little grape arbour with\na rustic bench where Roger used to smoke his pipe on summer evenings.\nAt the back of this arbour was the cellar door.  Aubrey tried it, and\nfound it locked.\n\nHe was in no mood to stick at trifles.  He was determined to unriddle\nthe mystery of the bookshop.  At the right of the door was a low\nwindow, level with the brick pavement.  Through the dusty pane he could\nsee it was fastened only by a hook on the inside.  He thrust his heel\nthrough the pane.  As the glass tinkled onto the cellar floor he heard\na low growl.  He unhooked the catch, lifted the frame of the broken\nwindow, and looked in.  There was Bock, with head quizzically tilted,\nuttering a rumbling guttural vibration that seemed to proceed\nautomatically from his interior.\n\nAubrey was a little dashed, but he said cheerily \"Hullo, Bock!  Good\nold man!  Well, well, nice old fellow!\"  To his surprise, Bock\nrecognized him as a friend and wagged his tail slightly, but still\ncontinued to growl.\n\n\"I wish dogs weren't such sticklers for form,\" thought Aubrey.  \"Now if\nI went in by the front door, Bock wouldn't say anything.  It's just\nbecause he sees me coming in this way that he's annoyed.  Well, I'll\nhave to take a chance.\"\n\nHe thrust his legs in through the window, carefully holding up the sash\nwith its jagged triangles of glass.  It will never be known how\nseverely Bock was tempted by the extremities thus exposed to him, but\nhe was an old dog and his martial instincts had been undermined by\nyears of kindness.  Moreover, he remembered Aubrey perfectly well, and\nthe smell of his trousers did not seem at all hostile.  So he contented\nhimself with a small grumbling of protest.  He was an Irish terrier,\nbut there was nothing Sinn Fein about him.\n\nAubrey dropped to the floor, and patted the dog, thanking his good\nfortune.  He glanced about the cellar as though expecting to find some\nlurking horror.  Nothing more appalling than several cases of beer\nbottles met his eyes.  He started quietly to go up the cellar stairs,\nand Bock, evidently consumed with legitimate curiosity, kept at his\nheels.\n\n\"Look here,\" thought Aubrey.  \"I don't want the dog following me all\nthrough the house.  If I touch anything he'll probably take a hunk out\nof my shin.\"\n\nHe unlocked the door into the yard, and Bock obeying the Irish\nterrier's natural impulse to get into the open air, ran outside.\nAubrey quickly closed the door again.  Bock's face appeared at the\nbroken window, looking in with so quaint an expression of indignant\nsurprise that Aubrey almost laughed.  \"There, old man,\" he said, \"it's\nall right.  I'm just going to look around a bit.\"\n\nHe ascended the stairs on tiptoe and found himself in the kitchen.  All\nwas quiet.  An alarm clock ticked with a stumbling, headlong hurry.\nPots of geraniums stood on the window sill.  The range, with its lids\noff and the fire carefully nourished, radiated a mild warmth.  Through\na dark little pantry he entered the dining room.  Still no sign of\nanything amiss.  A pot of white heather stood on the table, and a\ncorncob pipe lay on the sideboard.  \"This is the most innocent-looking\nkidnapper's den I ever heard of,\" he thought.  \"Any moving-picture\ndirector would be ashamed not to provide a better stage-set.\"\n\nAt that instant he heard footsteps overhead.  Curiously soft, muffled\nfootsteps.  Instantly he was on the alert.  Now he would know the worst.\n\nA window upstairs was thrown open.  \"Bock, what are you doing in the\nyard?\" floated a voice--a very clear, imperious voice that somehow made\nhim think of the thin ringing of a fine glass tumbler.  It was Titania.\n\nHe stood aghast.  Then he heard a door open, and steps on the stair.\nMerciful heaven, the girl must not find him here.  What WOULD she\nthink?  He skipped back into the pantry, and shrank into a corner.  He\nheard the footfalls reach the bottom of the stairs.  There was a door\ninto the kitchen from the central hall:  it was not necessary for her\nto pass through the pantry, he thought.  He heard her enter the kitchen.\n\nIn his anxiety he crouched down beneath the sink, and his foot, bent\nbeneath him, touched a large tin tray leaning against the wall.  It\nfell over with a terrible clang.\n\n\"Bock!\" said Titania sharply, \"what are you doing?\"\n\nAubrey was wondering miserably whether he ought to counterfeit a bark,\nbut it was too late to do anything.  The pantry door opened, and\nTitania looked in.\n\nThey gazed at each other for several seconds in mutual horror.  Even in\nhis abasement, crouching under a shelf in the corner, Aubrey's stricken\nsenses told him that he had never seen so fair a spectacle.  Titania\nwore a blue kimono and a curious fragile lacy bonnet which he did not\nunderstand.  Her dark, gold-spangled hair came down in two thick braids\nacross her shoulders.  Her blue eyes were very much alive with\namazement and alarm which rapidly changed into anger.\n\n\"Mr. Gilbert!\" she cried.  For an instant he thought she was going to\nlaugh.  Then a new expression came into her face.  Without another word\nshe turned and fled.  He heard her run upstairs.  A door banged, and\nwas locked.  A window was hastily closed.  Again all was silent.\n\nStupefied with chagrin, he rose from his cramped position.  What on\nearth was he to do?  How could he explain?  He stood by the pantry sink\nin painful indecision.  Should he slink out of the house?  No, he\ncouldn't do that without attempting to explain.  And he was still\nconvinced that some strange peril hung about this place.  He must put\nTitania on her guard, no matter how embarrassing it proved.  If only\nshe hadn't been wearing a kimono--how much easier it would have been.\n\nHe stepped out into the hall, and stood at the bottom of the stairs in\nthe throes of doubt.  After waiting some time in silence he cleared the\nhuskiness from his throat and called out:\n\n\"Miss Chapman!\"\n\nThere was no answer, but he heard light, rapid movements above.\n\n\"Miss Chapman!\" he called again.\n\nHe heard the door opened, and clear words edged with frost came\ndownward.  This time he thought of a thin tumbler with ice in it.\n\n\"Mr. Gilbert!\"\n\n\"Yes?\" he said miserably.\n\n\"Will you please call me a taxi?\"\n\nSomething in the calm, mandatory tone nettled him.  After all, he had\nacted in pure good faith.\n\n\"With pleasure,\" he said, \"but not until I have told you something.\nIt's very important.  I beg your pardon most awfully for frightening\nyou, but it's really very urgent.\"\n\nThere was a brief silence.  Then she said:\n\n\"Brooklyn's a queer place.  Wait a few minutes, please.\"\n\nAubrey stood absently fingering the pattern on the wallpaper.  He\nsuddenly experienced a great craving for a pipe, but felt that the\netiquette of the situation hardly permitted him to smoke.\n\nIn a few moments Titania appeared at the head of the stairs in her\ncustomary garb.  She sat down on the landing.  Aubrey felt that\neverything was as bad as it could possibly be.  If he could have seen\nher face his embarrassment would at least have had some compensation.\nBut the light from a stair window shone behind her, and her features\nwere in shadow.  She sat clasping her hands round her knees.  The light\nfell crosswise down the stairway, and he could see only a gleam of\nbrightness upon her ankle.  His mind unconsciously followed its beaten\npaths.  \"What a corking pose for a silk stocking ad!\" he thought.\n\"Wouldn't it make a stunning full-page layout.  I must suggest it to\nthe Ankleshimmer people.\"\n\n\"Well?\" she said.  Then she could not refrain from laughter, he looked\nso hapless.  She burst into an engaging trill.  \"Why don't you light\nyour pipe?\" she said.  \"You look as doleful as the Kaiser.\"\n\n\"Miss Chapman,\" he said, \"I'm afraid you think--I don't know what you\nmust think.  But I broke in here this morning because I--well, I don't\nthink this is a safe place for you to be.\"\n\n\"So it seems.  That's why I asked you to get me a taxi.\"\n\n\"There's something queer going on round this shop.  It's not right for\nyou to be here alone this way.  I was afraid something had happened to\nyou.  Of course, I didn't know you were--were----\"\n\nFaint almond blossoms grew in her cheeks.  \"I was reading,\" she said.\n\"Mr. Mifflin talks so much about reading in bed, I thought I'd try it.\nThey wanted me to go with them to-day but I wouldn't.  You see, if I'm\ngoing to be a bookseller I've got to catch up with some of this\nliterature that's been accumulating.  After they left I--I--well, I\nwanted to see if this reading in bed is what it's cracked up to be.\"\n\n\"Where has Mifflin gone?\" asked Aubrey.  \"What business has he got to\nleave you here all alone?\"\n\n\"I had Bock,\" said Titania.  \"Gracious, Brooklyn on Sunday morning\ndoesn't seem very perilous to me.  If you must know, he and Mrs.\nMifflin have gone over to spend the day with father.  I was to have\ngone, too, but I wouldn't.  What business is it of yours?  You're as\nbad as Morris Finsbury in The Wrong Box.  That's what I was reading\nwhen I heard the dog barking.\"\n\nAubrey began to grow nettled.  \"You seem to think this was a mere\nimpertinence on my part,\" he said.  \"Let me tell you a thing or two.\"\nAnd he briefly described to her the course of his experiences since\nleaving the shop on Friday evening, but omitting the fact that he was\nlodging just across the street.\n\n\"There's something mighty unpalatable going on,\" he said.  \"At first I\nthought Mifflin was the goat.  I thought it might be some frame-up for\nswiping valuable books from his shop.  But when I saw Weintraub come in\nhere with his own latch-key, I got wise.  He and Mifflin are in\ncahoots, that's what.  I don't know what they're pulling off, but I\ndon't like the looks of it.  You say Mifflin has gone out to see your\nfather?  I bet that's just camouflage, to stall you.  I've got a great\nmind to ring Mr. Chapman up and tell him he ought to get you out of\nhere.\"\n\n\"I won't hear a word said against Mr. Mifflin,\" said Titania angrily.\n\"He's one of my father's oldest friends.  What would Mr. Mifflin say if\nhe knew you had been breaking into his house and frightening me half to\ndeath?  I'm sorry you got that knock on the head, because it seems\nthat's your weak spot.  I'm quite able to take care of myself, thank\nyou.  This isn't a movie.\"\n\n\"Well, how do you explain the actions of this man Weintraub?\" said\nAubrey.  \"Do you like to have a man popping in and out of the shop at\nall hours of the night, stealing books?\"\n\n\"I don't have to explain it at all,\" said Titania.  \"I think it's up to\nyou to do the explaining.  Weintraub is a harmless old thing and he\nkeeps delicious chocolates that cost only half as much as what you get\non Fifth Avenue.  Mr. Mifflin told me that he's a very good customer.\nPerhaps his business won't let him read in the daytime, and he comes in\nhere late at night to borrow books.  He probably reads in bed.\"\n\n\"I don't think anybody who talks German round back alleys at night is a\nharmless old thing,\" said Aubrey.  \"I tell you, your Haunted Bookshop\nis haunted by something worse than the ghost of Thomas Carlyle.  Let me\nshow you something.\"  He pulled the book cover out of his pocket, and\npointed to the annotations in it.\n\n\"That's Mifflin's handwriting,\" said Titania, pointing to the upper row\nof figures.  \"He puts notes like that in all his favourite books.  They\nrefer to pages where he has found interesting things.\"\n\n\"Yes, and that's Weintraub's,\" said Aubrey, indicating the numbers in\nviolet ink.  \"If that isn't a proof of their complicity, I'd like to\nknow what is.  If that Cromwell book is here, I'd like to have a look\nat it.\"\n\nThey went into the shop.  Titania preceded him down the musty aisle,\nand it made Aubrey angry to see the obstinate assurance of her small\nshoulders.  He was horribly tempted to seize her and shake her.  It\nannoyed him to see her bright, unconscious girlhood in that dingy vault\nof books.  \"She's as out of place here as--as a Packard ad in the\nLiberator\" he said to himself.\n\nThey stood in the History alcove.  \"Here it is,\" she said.  \"No, it\nisn't--that's the History of Frederick the Great.\"\n\nThere was a two-inch gap in the shelf.  Cromwell was gone.\n\n\"Probably Mr. Mifflin has it somewhere around,\" said Titania.  \"It was\nthere last night.\"\n\n\"Probably nothing,\" said Aubrey.  \"I tell you, Weintraub came in and\ntook it.  I saw him.  Look here, if you really want to know what I\nthink, I'll tell you.  The War's not over by a long sight.  Weintraub's\na German.  Carlyle was pro-German--I remember that much from college.\nI believe your friend Mifflin is pro-German, too.  I've heard some of\nhis talk!\"\n\nTitania faced him with cheeks aflame.\n\n\"That'll do for you!\" she cried.  \"Next thing I suppose you'll say\nDaddy's pro-German, and me, too!  I'd like to see you say that to Mr.\nMifflin himself.\"\n\n\"I will, don't worry,\" said Aubrey grimly.  He knew now that he had put\nhimself hopelessly in the wrong in Titania's mind, but he refused to\nabate his own convictions.  With sinking heart he saw her face relieved\nagainst the shelves of faded bindings.  Her eyes shone with a deep and\nsultry blue, her chin quivered with anger.\n\n\"Look here,\" she said furiously.  \"Either you or I must leave this\nplace.  If you intend to stay, please call me a taxi.\"\n\nAubrey was as angry as she was.\n\n\"I'm going,\" he said.  \"But you've got to play fair with me.  I tell\nyou on my oath, these two men, Mifflin and Weintraub, are framing\nsomething up.  I'm going to get the goods on them and show you.  But\nyou mustn't put them wise that I'm on their track.  If you do, of\ncourse, they'll call it off.  I don't care what you think of me.\nYou've got to promise me that.\"\n\n\"I won't promise you ANYTHING,\" she said, \"except never to speak to you\nagain.  I never saw a man like you before--and I've seen a good many.\"\n\n\"I won't leave here until you promise me not to warn them,\" he\nretorted.  \"What I told you, I said in confidence.  They've already\nfound out where I'm lodging.  Do you think this is a joke?  They've\ntried to put me out of the way twice.  If you breathe a word of this to\nMifflin he'll warn the other two.\"\n\n\"You're afraid to have Mr. Mifflin know you broke into his shop,\" she\ntaunted.\n\n\"You can think what you like.\"\n\n\"I won't promise you anything!\" she burst out.  Then her face altered.\nThe defiant little line of her mouth bent and her strength seemed to\nrun out at each end of that pathetic curve.  \"Yes, I will,\" she said.\n\"I suppose that's fair.  I couldn't tell Mr. Mifflin, anyway.  I'd be\nashamed to tell him how you frightened me.  I think you're hateful.  I\ncame over here thinking I was going to have such a good time, and\nyou've spoilt it all!\"\n\nFor one terrible moment he thought she was going to cry.  But he\nremembered having seen heroines cry in the movies, and knew it was only\ndone when there was a table and chair handy.\n\n\"Miss Chapman,\" he said, \"I'm as sorry as a man can be.  But I swear I\ndid what I did in all honesty.  If I'm wrong in this, you need never\nspeak to me again.  If I'm wrong, you--you can tell your father to take\nhis advertising away from the Grey-Matter Company.  I can't say more\nthan that.\"\n\nAnd, to do him justice, he couldn't. It was the supreme sacrifice.\n\nShe let him out of the front door without another word.\n\n\n\nChapter XII\n\nAubrey Determines to give Service that's Different\n\n\nSeldom has a young man spent a more desolate afternoon than Aubrey on\nthat Sunday.  His only consolation was that twenty minutes after he had\nleft the bookshop he saw a taxi drive up (he was then sitting gloomily\nat his bedroom window) and Titania enter it and drive away.  He\nsupposed that she had gone to join the party in Larchmont, and was glad\nto know that she was out of what he now called the war zone.  For the\nfirst time on record, O. Henry failed to solace him.  His pipe tasted\nbitter and brackish.  He was eager to know what Weintraub was doing,\nbut did not dare make any investigations in broad daylight.  His idea\nwas to wait until dark.  Observing the Sabbath calm of the streets, and\nthe pageant of baby carriages wheeling toward Thackeray Boulevard, he\nwondered again whether he had thrown away this girl's friendship for a\nmerely imaginary suspicion.\n\nAt last he could endure his cramped bedroom no longer.  Downstairs\nsomeone was dolefully playing a flute, most horrible of all tortures to\ntightened nerves.  While her lodgers were at church the tireless Mrs.\nSchiller was doing a little housecleaning: he could hear the monotonous\nrasp of a carpet-sweeper passing back and forth in an adjoining room.\nHe creaked irritably downstairs, and heard the usual splashing behind\nthe bathroom door.  In the frame of the hall mirror he saw a pencilled\nnote: Will Mrs. Smith please call Tarkington 1565, it said.\nUnreasonably annoyed, he tore a piece of paper out of his notebook and\nwrote on it Will Mrs. Smith please call Bath 4200.  Mounting to the\nsecond floor he tapped on the bathroom door.  \"Don't come in!\" cried an\nagitated female voice.  He thrust the memorandum under the door, and\nleft the house.\n\nWalking the windy paths of Prospect Park he condemned himself to\nrelentless self-scrutiny.  \"I've damned myself forever with her,\" he\ngroaned, \"unless I can prove something.\"  The vision of Titania's face\nsilhouetted against the shelves of books came maddeningly to his mind.\n\"I was going to have such a good time, and you've spoilt it all!\" With\nwhat angry conviction she had said:  \"I never saw a man like you\nbefore--and I've seen a good many!\"\n\nEven in his disturbance of soul the familiar jargon of his profession\ncame naturally to utterance.  \"At least she admits I'm DIFFERENT,\" he\nsaid dolefully.  He remembered the first item in the Grey-Matter Code,\na neat little booklet issued by his employers for the information of\ntheir representatives:\n\n\nBusiness is built upon CONFIDENCE.  Before you can sell Grey-Matter\nService to a Client, you must sell YOURSELF.\n\n\n\"How am I going to sell myself to her?\" he wondered.  \"I've simply got\nto deliver, that's all.  I've got to give her service that's DIFFERENT.\nIf I fall down on this, she'll never speak to me again.  Not only that,\nthe firm will lose the old man's account.  It's simply unthinkable.\"\n\nNevertheless, he thought about it a good deal, stimulated from time to\ntime as in the course of his walk (which led him out toward the\nfaubourgs of Flatbush) he passed long vistas of signboards, which he\nimagined placarded with vivid lithographs in behalf of the Chapman\nprunes.  \"Adam and Eve Ate Prunes On Their Honeymoon\" was a slogan that\nflashed into his head, and he imagined a magnificent painting\nillustrating this text.  Thus, in hours of stress, do all men turn for\ncomfort to their chosen art.  The poet, battered by fate, heals himself\nin the niceties of rhyme.  The prohibitionist can weather the blackest\nmelancholia by meditating the contortions of other people's abstinence.\nThe most embittered citizen of Detroit will never perish by his own\nhand while he has an automobile to tinker.\n\nAubrey walked many miles, gradually throwing his despair to the winds.\nThe bright spirits of Orison Swett Marden and Ralph Waldo Trine,\nDioscuri of Good Cheer, seemed to be with him reminding him that\nnothing is impossible.  In a small restaurant he found sausages,\ngriddle cakes and syrup.  When he got back to Gissing Street it was\ndark, and he girded his soul for further endeavour.\n\nAbout nine o'clock he walked up the alley.  He had left his overcoat in\nhis room at Mrs. Schiller's and also the Cromwell bookcover--having\ntaken the precaution, however, to copy the inscriptions into his pocket\nmemorandum-book.  He noticed lights in the rear of the bookshop, and\nconcluded that the Mifflins and their employee had got home safely.\nArrived at the back of Weintraub's pharmacy, he studied the contours of\nthe building carefully.\n\nThe drug store lay, as we have explained before, at the corner of\nGissing Street and Wordsworth Avenue, just where the Elevated railway\nswings in a long curve.  The course of this curve brought the\nscaffolding of the viaduct out over the back roof of the building, and\nthis fact had impressed itself on Aubrey's observant eye the day\nbefore.  The front of the drug store stood three storeys, but in the\nrear it dropped to two, with a flat roof over the hinder portion.  Two\nwindows looked out upon this roof.  Weintraub's back yard opened onto\nthe alley, but the gate, he found, was locked.  The fence would not be\nhard to scale, but he hesitated to make so direct an approach.\n\nHe ascended the stairs of the \"L\" station, on the near side, and paying\na nickel passed through a turnstile onto the platform.  Waiting until\njust after a train had left, and the long, windy sweep of planking was\nsolitary, he dropped onto the narrow footway that runs beside the\ntrack.  This required watchful walking, for the charged third rail was\nvery near, but hugging the outer side of the path he proceeded without\ntrouble.  Every fifteen feet or so a girder ran sideways from the\ntrack, resting upon an upright from the street below.  The fourth of\nthese overhung the back corner of Weintraub's house, and he crawled\ncautiously along it.  People were passing on the pavement underneath,\nand he greatly feared being discovered.  But he reached the end of the\nbeam without mishap.  From here a drop of about twelve feet would bring\nhim onto Weintraub's back roof.  For a moment he reflected that, once\ndown there, it would be impossible to return the same way.  However, he\ndecided to risk it.  Where he was, with his legs swinging astride the\ngirder, he was in serious danger of attracting attention.\n\nHe would have given a great deal, just then, to have his overcoat with\nhim, for by lowering it first he could have jumped onto it and muffled\nthe noise of his fall.  He took off his coat and carefully dropped it\non the corner of the roof.  Then cannily waiting until a train passed\noverhead, drowning all other sounds with its roar, he lowered himself\nas far as he could hang by his hands, and let go.\n\nFor some minutes he lay prone on the tin roof, and during that time a\nnumber of distressing ideas occurred to him.  If he really expected to\nget into Weintraub's house, why had he not laid his plans more\ncarefully?  Why (for instance) had he not made some attempt to find out\nhow many there were in the household?  Why had he not arranged with one\nof his friends to call Weintraub to the telephone at a given moment, so\nthat he could be more sure of making an entry unnoticed?  And what did\nhe expect to see or do if he got inside the house?  He found no answer\nto any of these questions.\n\nIt was unpleasantly cold, and he was glad to slip his coat on again.\nThe small revolver was still in his hip pocket.  Another thought\noccurred to him--that he should have provided himself with tennis\nshoes.  However, it was some comfort to know that rubber heels of a\nnationally advertised brand were under him.  He crawled quietly up to\nthe sill of one of the windows.  It was closed, and the room inside was\ndark.  A blind was pulled most of the way down, leaving a gap of about\nfour inches.  Peeping cautiously over the sill, he could see farther\ninside the house a brightly lit door and a passageway.\n\n\"One thing I've got to look out for,\" he thought, \"is children.  There\nare bound to be some--who ever heard of a German without offspring?  If\nI wake them, they'll bawl.  This room is very likely a nursery, as it's\non the southeastern side.  Also, the window is shut tight, which is\nprobably the German idea of bedroom ventilation.\"\n\nHis guess may not have been a bad one, for after his eyes became\naccustomed to the dimness of the room he thought he could perceive two\ncot beds.  He then crawled over to the other window.  Here the blind\nwas pulled down flush with the bottom of the sash.  Trying the window\nvery cautiously, he found it locked.  Not knowing just what to do, he\nreturned to the first window, and lay there peering in.  The sill was\njust high enough above the roof level to make it necessary to raise\nhimself a little on his hands to see inside, and the position was very\ntrying.  Moreover, the tin roof had a tendency to crumple noisily when\nhe moved.  He lay for some time, shivering in the chill, and wondering\nwhether it would be safe to light a pipe.\n\n\"There's another thing I'd better look out for,\" he thought, \"and\nthat's a dog.  Who ever heard of a German without a dachshund?\"\n\nHe had watched the lighted doorway for a long while without seeing\nanything, and was beginning to think he was losing time to no profit\nwhen a stout and not ill-natured looking woman appeared in the hallway.\nShe came into the room he was studying, and closed the door.  She\nswitched on the light, and to his horror began to disrobe.  This was\nnot what he had counted on at all, and he retreated rapidly.  It was\nplain that nothing was to be gained where he was.  He sat timidly at\none edge of the roof and wondered what to do next.\n\nAs he sat there, the back door opened almost directly below him, and he\nheard the clang of a garbage can set out by the stoop.  The door stood\nopen for perhaps half a minute, and he heard a male voice--Weintraub's,\nhe thought--speaking in German.  For the first time in his life he\nyearned for the society of his German instructor at college, and also\nwondered--in the rapid irrelevance of thought--what that worthy man was\nnow doing to earn a living.  In a rather long and poorly lubricated\nsentence, heavily verbed at the end, he distinguished one phrase that\nseemed important.  \"Nach Philadelphia gehen\"--\"Go to Philadelphia.\"\n\nDid that refer to Mifflin? he wondered.\n\nThe door closed again.  Leaning over the rain-gutter, he saw the light\ngo out in the kitchen.  He tried to look through the upper portion of\nthe window just below him, but leaning out too far, the tin spout gave\nbeneath his hands.  Without knowing just how he did it, he slithered\ndown the side of the wall, and found his feet on a window-sill.  His\nhands still clung to the tin gutter above.  He made haste to climb down\nfrom his position, and found himself outside the back door.  He had\nmanaged the descent rather more quietly than if it had been carefully\nplanned.  But he was badly startled, and retreated to the bottom of the\nyard to see if he had aroused notice.\n\nA wait of several minutes brought no alarm, and he plucked up courage.\nOn the inner side of the house--away from Wordsworth Avenue--a narrow\npaved passage led to an outside cellar-way with old-fashioned slanting\ndoors.  He reconnoitred this warily.  A bright light was shining from a\nwindow in this alley.  He crept below it on hands and knees fearing to\nlook in until he had investigated a little.  He found that one flap of\nthe cellar door was open, and poked his nose into the aperture.  All\nwas dark below, but a strong, damp stench of paints and chemicals\narose.  He sniffed gingerly.  \"I suppose he stores drugs down there,\"\nhe thought.\n\nVery carefully he crawled back, on hands and knees, toward the lighted\nwindow.  Lifting his head a few inches at a time, finally he got his\neyes above the level of the sill.  To his disappointment he found the\nlower half of the window frosted.  As he knelt there, a pipe set in the\nwall suddenly vomited liquid which gushed out upon his knees.  He\nsniffed it, and again smelled a strong aroma of acids.  With great\ncare, leaning against the brick wall of the house, he rose to his feet\nand peeped through the upper half of the pane.\n\nIt seemed to be the room where prescriptions were compounded.  As it\nwas empty, he allowed himself a hasty survey.  All manner of bottles\nwere ranged along the walls; there was a high counter with scales, a\ndesk, and a sink.  At the back he could see the bamboo curtain which he\nremembered having noticed from the shop.  The whole place was in the\nutmost disorder:  mortars, glass beakers, a typewriter, cabinets of\nlabels, dusty piles of old prescriptions strung on filing hooks, papers\nof pills and capsules, all strewn in an indescribable litter.  Some\ninfusion was heating in a glass bowl propped on a tripod over a blue\ngas flame.  Aubrey noticed particularly a heap of old books several\nfeet high piled carelessly at one end of the counter.\n\nLooking more carefully, he saw that what he had taken for a mirror over\nthe prescription counter was an aperture looking into the shop.\nThrough this he could see Weintraub, behind the cigar case, waiting\nupon some belated customer with his shop-worn air of affability.  The\nvisitor departed, and Weintraub locked the door after him and pulled\ndown the blinds.  Then he returned toward the prescription room, and\nAubrey ducked out of view.\n\nPresently he risked looking again, and was just in time to see a\ncurious sight.  The druggist was bending over the counter, pouring some\nliquid into a glass vessel.  His face was directly under a hanging\nbulb, and Aubrey was amazed at the transformation.  The apparently\ngenial apothecary of cigar stand and soda fountain was gone.  He saw\ninstead a heavy, cruel, jowlish face, with eyelids hooded down over the\neyes, and a square thrusting chin buttressed on a mass of jaw and\nsuetty cheek that glistened with an oily shimmer.  The jaw quivered a\nlittle as though with some intense suppressed emotion.  The man was\ncompletely absorbed in his task.  The thick lower lip lapped upward\nover the mouth.  On the cheekbone was a deep red scar.  Aubrey felt a\npang of fascinated amazement at the gross energy and power of that\nabominable relentless mask.\n\n\"So this is the harmless old thing!\" he thought.\n\nJust then the bamboo curtain parted, and the woman whom he had seen\nupstairs appeared.  Forgetting his own situation, Aubrey still stared.\nShe wore a faded dressing gown and her hair was braided as though for\nthe night.  She looked frightened, and must have spoken, for Aubrey saw\nher lips move.  The man remained bent over his counter until the last\ndrops of liquid had run out.  His jaw tightened, he straightened\nsuddenly and took one step toward her, with outstretched hand\nimperiously pointed.  Aubrey could see his face plainly: it had a\nsavagery more than bestial.  The woman's face, which had borne a timid,\npleading expression, appealed in vain against that fierce gesture.  She\nturned and vanished.  Aubrey saw the druggist's pointing finger\ntremble.  Again he ducked out of sight.  \"That man's face would be\nlonely in a crowd,\" he said to himself.  \"And I used to think the\nmovies exaggerated things.  Say, he ought to play opposite Theda Bara.\"\n\nHe lay at full length in the paved alley and thought that a little\nacquaintance with Weintraub would go a long way.  Then the light in the\nwindow above him went out, and he gathered himself together for quick\nmotion if necessary.  Perhaps the man would come out to close the\ncellar door----\n\nThe thought was in his mind when a light flashed on farther down the\npassage, between him and the kitchen.  It came from a small barred\nwindow on the ground level.  Evidently the druggist had gone down into\nthe cellar.  Aubrey crawled silently along toward the yard.  Reaching\nthe lit pane he lay against the wall and looked in.\n\nThe window was too grimed for him to see clearly, but what he could\nmake out had the appearance of a chemical laboratory and machine shop\ncombined.  A long work bench was lit by several electrics.  On it he\nsaw glass vials of odd shapes, and a medley of tools.  Sheets of tin,\nlengths of lead pipe, gas burners, a vise, boilers and cylinders, tall\njars of coloured fluids.  He could hear a dull humming sound, which he\nsurmised came from some sort of revolving tool which he could see was\nrun by a belt from a motor.  On trying to spy more clearly he found\nthat what he had taken for dirt was a coat of whitewash which had been\napplied to the window on the inside, but the coating had worn away in\none spot which gave him a loophole.  What surprised him most was to spy\nthe covers of a number of books strewn about the work table.  One, he\nwas ready to swear, was the Cromwell.  He knew that bright blue cloth\nby this time.\n\nFor the second time that evening Aubrey wished for the presence of one\nof his former instructors.  \"I wish I had my old chemistry professor\nhere,\" he thought.  \"I'd like to know what this bird is up to.  I'd\nhate to swallow one of his prescriptions.\"\n\nHis teeth were chattering after the long exposure and he was wet\nthrough from lying in the little gutter that apparently drained off\nfrom the sink in Weintraub's prescription laboratory.  He could not see\nwhat the druggist was doing in the cellar, for the man's broad back was\nturned toward him.  He felt as though he had had quite enough thrills\nfor one evening.  Creeping along he found his way back to the yard, and\nstepped cautiously among the empty boxes with which it was strewn.  An\nelevated train rumbled overhead, and he watched the brightly lighted\ncars swing by.  While the train roared above him, he scrambled up the\nfence and dropped down into the alley.\n\n\"Well,\" he thought, \"I'd give full-page space, preferred position, in\nthe magazine Ben Franklin founded to the guy that'd tell me what's\ngoing on at this grand bolshevik headquarters.  It looks to me as\nthough they're getting ready to blow the Octagon Hotel off the map.\"\n\nHe found a little confectionery shop on Wordsworth Avenue that was\nstill open, and went in for a cup of hot chocolate to warm himself.\n\"The expense account on this business is going to be rather heavy,\" he\nsaid to himself.  \"I think I'll have to charge it up to the Daintybits\naccount.  Say, old Grey Matter gives service that's DIFFERENT, don't\nshe!  We not only keep Chapman's goods in the public eye, but we face\nall the horrors of Brooklyn to preserve his family from unlawful\noccasions.  No, I don't like the company that bookseller runs with.  If\n'nach Philadelphia' is the word, I think I'll tag along.  I guess it's\noff for Philadelphia in the morning!\"\n\n\n\nChapter XIII\n\nThe Battle of Ludlow Street\n\n\nRarely was a more genuine tribute paid to entrancing girlhood than when\nAubrey compelled himself, by sheer force of will and the ticking of his\nsubconscious time-sense, to wake at six o'clock the next morning.  For\nthis young man took sleep seriously and with a primitive zest.  It was\nto him almost a religious function.  As a minor poet has said, he \"made\nsleep a career.\"\n\nBut he did not know what train Roger might be taking, and he was\ndetermined not to miss him.  By a quarter after six he was seated in\nthe Milwaukee Lunch (which is never closed--Open from Now Till the\nJudgment Day.  Tables for Ladies, as its sign says) with a cup of\ncoffee and corned beef hash.  In the mood of tender melancholy common\nto unaccustomed early rising he dwelt fondly on the thought of Titania,\nso near and yet so far away.  He had leisure to give free rein to these\nmusings, for it was ten past seven before Roger appeared, hurrying\ntoward the subway.  Aubrey followed at a discreet distance, taking care\nnot to be observed.\n\nThe bookseller and his pursuer both boarded the eight o'clock train at\nthe Pennsylvania Station, but in very different moods.  To Roger, this\nexpedition was a frolic, pure and simple.  He had been tied down to the\nbookshop so long that a day's excursion seemed too good to be true.  He\nbought two cigars--an unusual luxury--and let the morning paper lie\nunheeded in his lap as the train drummed over the Hackensack marshes.\nHe felt a good deal of pride in having been summoned to appraise the\nOldham library.  Mr. Oldham was a very distinguished collector, a\nwealthy Philadelphia merchant whose choice Johnson, Lamb, Keats, and\nBlake items were the envy of connoisseurs all over the world.  Roger\nknew very well that there were many better-known dealers who would have\njumped at the chance to examine the collection and pocket the\nappraiser's fee.  The word that Roger had had by long distance\ntelephone was that Mr. Oldham had decided to sell his collection, and\nbefore putting it to auction desired the advices of an expert as to the\nprices his items should command in the present state of the market.\nAnd as Roger was not particularly conversant with current events in the\nworld of rare books and manuscripts, he spent most of the trip in\nturning over some annotated catalogues of recent sales which Mr.\nChapman had lent him.  \"This invitation,\" he said to himself, \"confirms\nwhat I have always said, that the artist, in any line of work, will\neventually be recognized above the mere tradesman.  Somehow or other\nMr. Oldham has heard that I am not only a seller of old books but a\nlover of them.  He prefers to have me go over his treasures with him,\nrather than one of those who peddle these things like so much tallow.\"\n\nAubrey's humour was far removed from that of the happy bookseller.  In\nthe first place, Roger was sitting in the smoker, and as Aubrey feared\nto enter the same car for fear of being observed, he had to do without\nhis pipe.  He took the foremost seat in the second coach, and peering\noccasionally through the glass doors he could see the bald poll of his\nquarry wreathed with exhalements of cheap havana.  Secondly, he had\nhoped to see Weintraub on the same train, but though he had tarried at\nthe train-gate until the last moment, the German had not appeared.  He\nhad concluded from Weintraub's words the night before that druggist and\nbookseller were bound on a joint errand.  Apparently he was mistaken.\nHe bit his nails, glowered at the flying landscape, and revolved many\ngrievous fancies in his prickling bosom.  Among other discontents was\nthe knowledge that he did not have enough money with him to pay his\nfare back to New York, and he would either have to borrow from someone\nin Philadelphia or wire to his office for funds.  He had not\nanticipated, when setting out upon this series of adventures, that it\nwould prove so costly.\n\nThe train drew into Broad Street station at ten o'clock, and Aubrey\nfollowed the bookseller through the bustling terminus and round the\nCity Hall plaza.  Mifflin seemed to know his way, but Philadelphia was\ncomparatively strange to the Grey-Matter solicitor.  He was quite\nsurprised at the impressive vista of South Broad Street, and chagrined\nto find people jostling him on the crowded pavement as though they did\nnot know he had just come from New York.\n\nRoger turned in at a huge office building on Broad Street and took an\nexpress elevator.  Aubrey did not dare follow him into the car, so he\nwaited in the lobby.  He learned from the starter that there was a\nsecond tier of elevators on the other side of the building, so he\ntipped a boy a quarter to watch them for him, describing Mifflin so\naccurately that he could not be missed.  By this time Aubrey was in a\nthoroughly ill temper, and enjoyed quarrelling with the starter on the\nsubject of indicators for showing the position of the elevators.\nObserving that in this building the indicators were glass tubes in\nwhich the movement of the car was traced by a rising or falling column\nof coloured fluid, Aubrey remarked testily that that old-fashioned\nstunt had long been abandoned in New York.  The starter retorted that\nNew York was only two hours away if he liked it better.  This argument\nhelped to fleet the time rapidly.\n\nMeanwhile Roger, with the pleasurable sensation of one who expects to\nbe received as a distinguished visitor from out of town, had entered\nthe luxurious suite of Mr. Oldham.  A young lady, rather too\ntransparently shirtwaisted but fair to look upon, asked what she could\ndo for him.\n\n\"I want to see Mr. Oldham.\"\n\n\"What name shall I say?\"\n\n\"Mr. Mifflin--Mr. Mifflin of Brooklyn.\"\n\n\"Have you an appointment?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nRoger sat down with agreeable anticipation.  He noticed the shining\nmahogany of the office furniture, the sparkling green jar of drinking\nwater, the hushed and efficient activity of the young ladies.\n\"Philadelphia girls are amazingly comely,\" he said to himself, \"but\nnone of these can hold a candle to Miss Titania.\"\n\nThe young lady returned from the private office looking a little\nperplexed.\n\n\"Did you have an appointment with Mr. Oldham?\" she said.  \"He doesn't\nseem to recall it.\"\n\n\"Why, certainly,\" said Roger.  \"It was arranged by telephone on\nSaturday afternoon.  Mr. Oldham's secretary called me up.\"\n\n\"Have I got your name right?\" she asked, showing a slip on which she\nhad written Mr. Miflin.\n\n\"Two f's,\" said Roger.  \"Mr. Roger Mifflin, the bookseller.\"\n\nThe girl retired, and came back a moment later.\n\n\"Mr. Oldham's very busy,\" she said, \"but he can see you for a moment.\"\n\nRoger was ushered into the private office, a large, airy room lined\nwith bookshelves.  Mr. Oldham, a tall, thin man with short gray hair\nand lively black eyes, rose courteously from his desk.\n\n\"How do you do, sir,\" he said.  \"I'm sorry, I had forgotten our\nappointment.\"\n\n\"He must be very absent minded,\" thought Roger.  \"Arranges to sell a\ncollection worth half a million, and forgets all about it.\"\n\n\"I came over in response to your message,\" he said.  \"About selling\nyour collection.\"\n\nMr. Oldham looked at him, rather intently, Roger thought.\n\n\"Do you want to buy it?\" he said.\n\n\"To buy it?\" said Roger, a little peevishly.  \"Why, no.  I came over to\nappraise it for you.  Your secretary telephoned me on Saturday.\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" replied the other, \"there must be some mistake.  I have\nno intention of selling my collection.  I never sent you a message.\"\n\nRoger was aghast.\n\n\"Why,\" he exclaimed, \"your secretary called me up on Saturday and said\nyou particularly wanted me to come over this morning, to examine your\nbooks with you.  I've made the trip from Brooklyn for that purpose.\"\n\nMr. Oldham touched a buzzer, and a middle-aged woman came into the\noffice.  \"Miss Patterson,\" he said, \"did you telephone to Mr. Mifflin\nof Brooklyn on Saturday, asking him----\"\n\n\"It was a man that telephoned,\" said Roger.\n\n\"I'm exceedingly sorry, Mr. Mifflin,\" said Mr. Oldham.  \"More sorry\nthan I can tell you--I'm afraid someone has played a trick on you.  As\nI told you, and Miss Patterson will bear me out, I have no idea of\nselling my books, and have never authorized any one even to suggest\nsuch a thing.\"\n\nRoger was filled with confusion and anger.  A hoax on the part of some\nof the Corn Cob Club, he thought to himself.  He flushed painfully to\nrecall the simplicity of his glee.\n\n\"Please don't be embarrassed,\" said Mr. Oldham, seeing the little man's\nvexation.  \"Don't let's consider the trip wasted.  Won't you come out\nand dine with me in the country this evening, and see my things?\"\n\nBut Roger was too proud to accept this balm, courteous as it was.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said, \"but I'm afraid I can't do it.  I'm rather busy\nat home, and only came over because I believed this to be urgent.\"\n\n\"Some other time, perhaps,\" said Mr. Oldham.  \"Look here, you're a\nbookseller?  I don't believe I know your shop.  Give me your card.  The\nnext time I'm in New York I'd like to stop in.\"\n\nRoger got away as quickly as the other's politeness would let him.  He\nchafed savagely at the awkwardness of his position.  Not until he\nreached the street again did he breathe freely.\n\n\"Some of Jerry Gladfist's tomfoolery, I'll bet a hat,\" he muttered.\n\"By the bones of Fanny Kelly, I'll make him smart for it.\"\n\nEven Aubrey, picking up the trail again, could see that Roger was angry.\n\n\"Something's got his goat,\" he reflected.  \"I wonder what he's peeved\nabout?\"\n\nThey crossed Broad Street and Roger started off down Chestnut.  Aubrey\nsaw the bookseller halt in a doorway to light his pipe, and stopped\nsome yards behind him to look up at the statue of William Penn on the\nCity Hall.  It was a blustery day, and at that moment a gust of wind\nwhipped off his hat and sent it spinning down Broad Street.  He ran\nhalf a block before he recaptured it.  When he got back to Chestnut,\nRoger had disappeared.  He hurried down Chestnut Street, bumping\npedestrians in his eagerness, but at Thirteenth he halted in dismay.\nNowhere could he see a sign of the little bookseller.  He appealed to\nthe policeman at that corner, but learned nothing.  Vainly he scoured\nthe block and up and down Juniper Street.  It was eleven o'clock, and\nthe streets were thronged.\n\nHe cursed the book business in both hemispheres, cursed himself, and\ncursed Philadelphia.  Then he went into a tobacconist's and bought a\npacket of cigarettes.\n\nFor an hour he patrolled up and down Chestnut Street, on both sides of\nthe way, thinking he might possibly encounter Roger.  At the end of\nthis time he found himself in front of a newspaper office, and\nremembered that an old friend of his was an editorial writer on the\nstaff.  He entered, and went up in the elevator.\n\nHe found his friend in a small grimy den, surrounded by a sea of\npapers, smoking a pipe with his feet on the table.  They greeted each\nother joyfully.\n\n\"Well, look who's here!\" cried the facetious journalist.  \"Tamburlaine\nthe Great, and none other!  What brings you to this distant outpost?\"\n\nAubrey grinned at the use of his old college nickname.\n\n\"I've come to lunch with you, and borrow enough money to get home with.\"\n\n\"On Monday?\" cried the other.  \"Tuesday being the day of stipend in\nthese quarters?  Nay, say not so!\"\n\nThey lunched together at a quiet Italian restaurant, and Aubrey\nnarrated tersely the adventures of the past few days.  The newspaper\nman smoked pensively when the story was concluded.\n\n\"I'd like to see the girl,\" he said.  \"Tambo, your tale hath the ring\nof sincerity.  It is full of sound and fury, but it signifieth\nsomething.  You say your man is a second-hand bookseller?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then I know where you'll find him.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\"\n\n\"It's worth trying.  Go up to Leary's, 9 South Ninth.  It's right on\nthis street.  I'll show you.\"\n\n\"Let's go,\" said Aubrey promptly.\n\n\"Not only that,\" said the other, \"but I'll lend you my last V.  Not for\nyour sake, but on behalf of the girl.  Just mention my name to her,\nwill you?\n\n\"Right up the block,\" he pointed as they reached Chestnut Street.  \"No,\nI won't come with you, Wilson's speaking to Congress to-day, and\nthere's big stuff coming over the wire.  So long, old man.  Invite me\nto the wedding!\"\n\nAubrey had no idea what Leary's was, and rather expected it to be a\ntavern of some sort.  When he reached the place, however, he saw why\nhis friend had suggested it as a likely lurking ground for Roger.  It\nwould be as impossible for any bibliophile to pass this famous\nsecond-hand bookstore as for a woman to go by a wedding party without\ntrying to see the bride.  Although it was a bleak day, and a snell wind\nblew down the street, the pavement counters were lined with people\nturning over disordered piles of volumes.  Within, he could see a vista\nof white shelves, and the many-coloured tapestry of bindings stretching\nfar away to the rear of the building.\n\nHe entered eagerly, and looked about.  The shop was comfortably busy,\nwith a number of people browsing.  They seemed normal enough from\nbehind, but in their eyes he detected the wild, peering glitter of the\nbibliomaniac.  Here and there stood members of the staff.  Upon their\nfeatures Aubrey discerned the placid and philosophic tranquillity which\nhe associated with second-hand booksellers--all save Mifflin.\n\nHe paced through the narrow aisles, scanning the blissful throng of\nseekers.  He went down to the educational department in the basement,\nup to the medical books in the gallery, even back to the sections of\nDrama and Pennsylvania History in the raised quarterdeck at the rear.\nThere was no trace of Roger.\n\nAt a desk under the stairway he saw a lean, studious, and\nkindly-looking bibliosoph, who was poring over an immense catalogue.\nAn idea struck him.\n\n\"Have you a copy of Carlyle's Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell?\"\nhe asked.\n\nThe other looked up.\n\n\"I'm afraid we haven't,\" he said.  \"Another gentleman was in here\nasking for it just a few minutes ago.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" cried Aubrey.  \"Did he get it?\"\n\nThis emphasis brought no surprise to the bookseller, who was accustomed\nto the oddities of edition hunters.\n\n\"No,\" he said.  \"We didn't have a copy.  We haven't seen one for a long\ntime.\"\n\n\"Was he a little bald man with a red beard and bright blue eyes?\" asked\nAubrey hoarsely.\n\n\"Yes--Mr. Mifflin of Brooklyn.  Do you know him?\"\n\n\"I should say I do!\" cried Aubrey.  \"Where has he gone?  I've been\nhunting him all over town, the scoundrel!\"\n\nThe bookseller, douce man, had seen too many eccentric customers to be\nshocked by the vehemence of his questioner.\n\n\"He was here a moment ago,\" he said gently, and gazed with a mild\ninterest upon the excited young advertising man.  \"I daresay you'll\nfind him just outside, in Ludlow Street.\"\n\n\"Where's that?\"\n\nThe tall man--and I don't see why I should scruple to name him, for it\nwas Philip Warner--explained that Ludlow Street was the narrow alley\nthat runs along one side of Leary's and elbows at right angles behind\nthe shop.  Down the flank of the store, along this narrow little\nstreet, run shelves of books under a penthouse.  It is here that\nLeary's displays its stock of ragamuffin ten-centers--queer dingy\nvolumes that call to the hearts of gentle questers.  Along these\nhistoric shelves many troubled spirits have come as near happiness as\nthey are like to get . . . for after all, happiness (as the\nmathematicians might say) lies on a curve, and we approach it only by\nasymptote. . . . The frequenters of this alley call themselves\nwhimsically The Ludlow Street Business Men's Association, and Charles\nLamb or Eugene Field would have been proud to preside at their annual\ndinners, at which the members recount their happiest book-finds of the\nyear.\n\nAubrey rushed out of the shop and looked down the alley.  Half a dozen\nLudlow Street Business Men were groping among the shelves.  Then, down\nat the far end, his small face poked into an open volume, he saw Roger.\nHe approached with a rapid stride.\n\n\"Well,\" he said angrily, \"here you are!\"\n\nRoger looked up from his book good-humouredly.  Apparently, in the zeal\nof his favourite pastime, he had forgotten where he was.\n\n\"Hullo!\" he said.  \"What are you doing in Brooklyn?  Look here, here's\na copy of Tooke's Pantheon----\"\n\n\"What's the idea?\" cried Aubrey harshly.  \"Are you trying to kid me?\nWhat are you and Weintraub framing up here in Philadelphia?\"\n\nRoger's mind came back to Ludlow Street.  He looked with some surprise\nat the flushed face of the young man, and put the book back in its\nplace on the shelf, making a mental note of its location.  His\ndisappointment of the morning came back to him with some irritation.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" he said.  \"What the deuce business is it\nof yours?\"\n\n\"I'll make it my business,\" said Aubrey, and shook his fist in the\nbookseller's face.  \"I've been trailing you, you scoundrel, and I want\nto know what kind of a game you're playing.\"\n\nA spot of red spread on Roger's cheekbones.  In spite of his apparent\ndemureness he had a pugnacious spirit and a quick fist.\n\n\"By the bones of Charles Lamb!\" he said.  \"Young man, your manners need\nmending.  If you're looking for display advertising, I'll give you one\non each eye.\"\n\nAubrey had expected to find a cringing culprit, and this back talk\ninfuriated him beyond control.\n\n\"You damned little bolshevik,\" he said, \"if you were my size I'd give\nyou a hiding.  You tell me what you and your pro-German pals are up to\nor I'll put the police on you!\"\n\nRoger stiffened.  His beard bristled, and his blue eyes glittered.\n\n\"You impudent dog,\" he said quietly, \"you come round the corner where\nthese people can't see us and I'll give you some private tutoring.\"\n\nHe led the way round the corner of the alley.  In this narrow channel,\nbetween blank walls, they confronted each other.\n\n\"In the name of Gutenberg,\" said Roger, calling upon his patron saint,\n\"explain yourself or I'll hit you.\"\n\n\"Who's he?\" sneered Aubrey.  \"Another one of your Huns?\"\n\nThat instant he received a smart blow on the chin, which would have\nbeen much harder but that Roger misgauged his footing on the uneven\ncobbles, and hardly reached the face of his opponent, who topped him by\nmany inches.\n\nAubrey forgot his resolution not to hit a smaller man, and also calling\nupon his patron saints--the Associated Advertising Clubs of the\nWorld--he delivered a smashing slog which hit the bookseller in the\nchest and jolted him half across the alley.\n\nBoth men were furiously angry--Aubrey with the accumulated bitterness\nof several days' anxiety and suspicion, and Roger with the\nquick-flaming indignation of a hot-tempered man unwarrantably outraged.\nAubrey had the better of the encounter in height, weight, and more than\ntwenty years juniority, but fortune played for the bookseller.\nAubrey's terrific punch sent the latter staggering across the alley\nonto the opposite curb.  Aubrey followed him up with a rush, intending\nto crush the other with one fearful smite.  But Roger, keeping cool,\nnow had the advantage of position.  Standing on the curb, he had a\nlittle the better in height.  As Aubrey leaped at him, his face grim\nwith hatred, Roger met him with a savage buffet on the jaw.  Aubrey's\nfoot struck against the curb, and he fell backward onto the stones.\nHis head crashed violently on the cobbles, and the old cut on his scalp\nbroke out afresh.  Dazed and shaken, there was, for the moment, no more\nfight in him.\n\n\"You insolent pup,\" panted Roger, \"do you want any more?\" Then he saw\nthat Aubrey was really hurt.  With horror he observed a trickle of\nblood run down the side of the young man's face.\n\n\"Good Lord,\" he said.  \"Maybe I've killed him!\"\n\nIn a panic he ran round the corner to get Leary's outside man, who\nstands in a little sentry box at the front angle of the store and sells\nthe outdoor books.\n\n\"Quick,\" he said.  \"There's a fellow back here badly hurt.\"\n\nThey ran back around the corner, and found Aubrey walking rather\nshakily toward them.  Immense relief swam through Roger's brain.\n\n\"Look here,\" he said, \"I'm awfully sorry--are you hurt?\"\n\nAubrey glared whitely at him, but was too stunned to speak.  He\ngrunted, and the others took him one on each side and supported him.\nLeary's man ran inside the store and opened the little door of the\nfreight elevator at the back of the shop.  In this way, avoiding notice\nsave by a few book-prowlers, Aubrey was carted into the shop as though\nhe had been a parcel of second-hand books.\n\nMr. Warner greeted them at the back of the shop, a little surprised,\nbut gentle as ever.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, we've been fighting over a copy of Tooke's Pantheon,\" said Roger.\n\nThey led Aubrey into the little private office at the rear.  Here they\nmade him sit down in a chair and bathed his bleeding head with cold\nwater.  Philip Warner, always resourceful, produced some surgical\nplaster.  Roger wanted to telephone for a doctor.\n\n\"Not on your life,\" said Aubrey, pulling himself together.  \"See here,\nMr. Mifflin, don't flatter yourself you gave me this cut on the skull.\nI got that the other evening on Brooklyn Bridge, going home from your\ndamned bookshop.  Now if you and I can be alone for a few minutes,\nwe've got to have a talk.\"\n\n\n\nChapter XIV\n\nThe \"Cromwell\" Makes its Last Appearance\n\n\n\"You utter idiot,\" said Roger, half an hour later.  \"Why didn't you\ntell me all this sooner?  Good Lord, man, there's some devil's work\ngoing on!\"\n\n\"How the deuce was I to know you knew nothing about it?\" said Aubrey\nimpatiently.  \"You'll grant everything pointed against you?  When I saw\nthat guy go into the shop with his own key, what could I think but that\nyou were in league with him?  Gracious, man, are you so befuddled in\nyour old books that you don't see what's going on round you?\"\n\n\"What time did you say that was?\" said Roger shortly.\n\n\"One o'clock Sunday morning.\"\n\nRoger thought a minute.  \"Yes, I was in the cellar with Bock,\" he said.\n\"Bock barked, and I thought it was rats.  That fellow must have taken\nan impression of the lock and made himself a key.  He's been in the\nshop hundreds of times, and could easily do it.  That explains the\ndisappearing Cromwell.  But WHY?  What's the idea?\"\n\n\"For the love of heaven,\" said Aubrey.  \"Let's get back to Brooklyn as\nsoon as we can.  God only knows what may have happened.  Fool that I\nwas, to go away and leave those women all alone.  Triple-distilled\nlunacy!\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said Roger, \"I was the fool to be lured off by a fake\ntelephone call.  Judging by what you say, Weintraub must have worked\nthat also.\"\n\nAubrey looked at his watch.  \"Just after three,\" he said.\n\n\"We can't get a train till four,\" said Roger.  \"That means we can't get\nback to Gissing Street until nearly seven.\"\n\n\"Call them up,\" said Aubrey.\n\nThey were still in the private office at the rear of Leary's.  Roger\nwas well-known in the shop, and had no hesitation in using the\ntelephone.  He lifted the receiver.\n\n\"Long Distance, please,\" he said.  \"Hullo?  I want to get Brooklyn,\nWordsworth 1617-W.\"\n\nThey spent a sour twenty-five minutes waiting for the connection.\nRoger went out to talk with Warner, while Aubrey fumed in the back\noffice.  He could not sit still, and paced the little room in a fidget\nof impatience, tearing his watch out of his pocket every few minutes.\nHe felt dull and sick with vague fear.  To his mind recurred the\nspiteful buzz of that voice over the wire--\"Gissing Street is not\nhealthy for you.\"  He remembered the scuffle on the Bridge, the\nwhispering in the alley, and the sinister face of the druggist at his\nprescription counter.  The whole series of events seemed a grossly\nfantastic nightmare, yet it frightened him.  \"If only I were in\nBrooklyn,\" he groaned, \"it wouldn't be so bad.  But to be over here, a\nhundred miles away, in another cursed bookshop, while that girl may be\nin trouble--Gosh!\" he muttered.  \"If I get through this business all\nright I'll lay off bookshops for the rest of my life!\"\n\nThe telephone rang, and Aubrey frantically beckoned to Roger, who was\noutside, talking.\n\n\"Answer it, you chump!\" said Roger.  \"We'll lose the connection!\"\n\n\"Nix,\" said Aubrey.  \"If Titania hears my voice she'll ring off.  She's\nsore at me.\"\n\nRoger ran to the instrument.  \"Hullo, hullo?\" he said, irritably.\n\"Hullo, is that Wordsworth----?  Yes, I'm calling Brooklyn--Hullo!\"\n\nAubrey, leaning over Roger's shoulder, could hear a clucking in the\nreceiver, and then, incredibly clear, a thin, silver, distant voice.\nHow well he knew it!  It seemed to vibrate in the air all about him.\nHe could hear every syllable distinctly.  A hot perspiration burst out\non his forehead and in the palms of his hands.\n\n\"Hullo,\" said Roger.  \"Is that Mifflin's Bookshop?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Titania.  \"Is that you, Mr. Mifflin?  Where are you?\"\n\n\"In Philadelphia,\" said Roger.  \"Tell me, is everything all right?\"\n\n\"Everything's dandy,\" said Titania.  \"I'm selling loads of books.  Mrs.\nMifflin's gone out to do some shopping.\"\n\nAubrey shook to hear the tiny, airy voice, like a trill of birdsong,\nlike a tinkling from some distant star.  He could imagine her standing\nat the phone in the back of the shadowy bookshop, and seemed to see her\nas though through an inverted telescope, very minute and very perfect.\nHow brave and exquisite she was!\n\n\"When are you coming home?\" she was saying.\n\n\"About seven o'clock,\" said Roger.  \"Listen, is everything absolutely\nO. K.?\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" said Titania.  \"I've been having lots of fun.  I went down\njust now and put some coal on the furnace.  Oh, yes.  Mr. Weintraub\ncame in a little while ago and left a suitcase of books.  He said you\nwouldn't mind.  A friend of his is going to call for them this\nafternoon.\"\n\n\"Hold the wire a moment,\" said Roger, and clapped his hand over the\nmouthpiece.  \"She says Weintraub left a suitcase of books there to be\ncalled for.  What do you make of that?\"\n\n\"For the love of God, tell her not to touch those books.\"\n\n\"Hullo?\" said Roger.  Aubrey, leaning over him, noticed that the little\nbookseller's naked pate was ringed with crystal beads.\n\n\"Hullo?\" replied Titania's elfin voice promptly.\n\n\"Did you open the suitcase?\"\n\n\"No.  It's locked.  Mr. Weintraub said there were a lot of old books in\nit for a friend of his.  It's very heavy.\"\n\n\"Look here,\" said Roger, and his voice rang sharply.  \"This is\nimportant.  I don't want you to touch that suitcase.  Leave it wherever\nit is, and DON'T TOUCH IT.  Promise me.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Mifflin.  Had I better put it in a safe place?\"\n\n\"DON'T TOUCH IT!\"\n\n\"Bock's sniffing at it now.\"\n\n\"Don't touch it, and don't let Bock touch it.  It--it's got valuable\npapers in it.\"\n\n\"I'll be careful of it,\" said Titania.\n\n\"Promise me not to touch it.  And another thing--if any one calls for\nit, don't let them take it until I get home.\"\n\nAubrey held out his watch in front of Roger.  The latter nodded.\n\n\"Do you understand?\" he said.  \"Do you hear me all right?\"\n\n\"Yes, splendidly.  I think it's wonderful!  You know I never talked on\nlong distance before----\"\n\n\"Don't touch the bag,\" repeated Roger doggedly, \"and don't let any one\ntake it until we--until I get back.\"\n\n\"I promise,\" said Titania blithely.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said Roger, and set down the receiver.  His face looked\ncuriously pinched, and there was perspiration in the hollows under his\neyes.  Aubrey held out his watch impatiently.\n\n\"We've just time to make it,\" cried Roger, and they rushed from the\nshop.\n\n\nIt was not a sprightly journey.  The train made its accustomed detour\nthrough West Philadelphia and North Philadelphia before getting down to\nbusiness, and the two voyagers felt a personal hatred of the brakemen\nwho permitted passengers from these suburbs to straggle leisurely\naboard instead of flogging them in with knotted whips.  When the\nexpress stopped at Trenton, Aubrey could easily have turned a howitzer\nupon that innocent city and blasted it into rubble.  An unexpected stop\nat Princeton Junction was the last straw.  Aubrey addressed the\nconductor in terms that were highly treasonable, considering that this\nofficial was a government servant.\n\nThe winter twilight drew in, gray and dreary, with a threat of snow.\nFor some time they sat in silence, Roger buried in a Philadelphia\nafternoon paper containing the text of the President's speech\nannouncing his trip to Europe, and Aubrey gloomily recapitulating the\nschedule of his past week.  His head throbbed, his hands were wet with\nnervousness so that crumbs of tobacco adhered to them annoyingly.\n\n\"It's a funny thing,\" he said at last.  \"You know I never heard of your\nshop until a week ago to-day, and now it seems like the most important\nplace on earth.  It was only last Tuesday that we had supper together,\nand since then I've had my scalp laid open twice, had a desperado lie\nin wait for me in my own bedroom, spent two night vigils on Gissing\nStreet, and endangered the biggest advertising account our agency\nhandles.  I don't wonder you call the place haunted!\"\n\n\"I suppose it would all make good advertising copy?\" said Roger\npeevishly.\n\n\"Well, I don't know\" said Aubrey.  \"It's a bit too rough, I'm afraid.\nHow do you dope it out?\"\n\n\"I don't know what to think.  Weintraub has run that drug store for\ntwenty years or more.  Years ago, before I ever got into the book\nbusiness, I used to know his shop.  He was always rather interested in\nbooks, especially scientific books, and we got quite friendly when I\nopened up on Gissing Street.  I never fell for his face very hard, but\nhe always seemed quiet and well-disposed.  It sounds to me like some\nkind of trade in illicit drugs, or German incendiary bombs.  You know\nwhat a lot of fires there were during the war--those big grain\nelevators in Brooklyn, and so on.\"\n\n\"I thought at first it was a kidnapping stunt,\" said Aubrey.  \"I\nthought you had got Miss Chapman planted in your shop so that these\nother guys could smuggle her away.\"\n\n\"You seem to have done me the honour of thinking me a very complete\nrascal,\" said Roger.\n\nAubrey's lips trembled with irritable retort, but he checked himself\nheroically.\n\n\"What was your particular interest in the Cromwell book?\" he asked\nafter a pause.\n\n\"Oh, I read somewhere--two or three years ago--that it was one of\nWoodrow Wilson's favourite books.  That interested me, and I looked it\nup.\"\n\n\"By the way,\" cried Aubrey excitedly, \"I forgot to show you those\nnumbers that were written in the cover.\"  He pulled out his memorandum\nbook, and showed the transcript he had made.\n\n\"Well, one of these is perfectly understandable,\" said Roger.  \"Here,\nwhere it says 329 ff.  cf.  W. W. That simply means 'pages 329 and\nfollowing, compare Woodrow Wilson.'  I remember jotting that down not\nlong ago, because that passage in the book reminded me of some of\nWilson's ideas.  I generally note down in the back of a book the\nnumbers of any pages that interest me specially.  These other page\nnumbers convey nothing unless I had the book before me.\"\n\n\"The first bunch of numbers was in your handwriting, then; but\nunderneath were these others, in Weintraub's--or at any rate in his\nink.  When I saw that he was jotting down what I took to be code stuff\nin the backs of your books I naturally assumed you and he were working\ntogether----\"\n\n\"And you found the cover in his drug store?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nRoger scowled.  \"I don't make it out,\" he said.  \"Well, there's nothing\nwe can do till we get there.  Do you want to look at the paper?\nThere's the text of Wilson's speech to Congress this morning.\"\n\nAubrey shook his head dismally, and leaned his hot forehead against the\npane.  Neither of them spoke again until they reached Manhattan\nTransfer, where they changed for the Hudson Terminal.\n\nIt was seven o'clock when they hurried out of the subway terminus at\nAtlantic Avenue.  It was a raw, damp evening, but the streets had\nalready begun to bustle with their nightly exuberance of light and\ncolour.  The yellow glitter of a pawnshop window reminded Aubrey of the\nsmall revolver in his pocket.  As they passed a dark alley, he stepped\naside to load the weapon.\n\n\"Have you anything of this sort with you?\" he said, showing it to Roger.\n\n\"Good Lord, no,\" said the bookseller.  \"What do you think I am, a\nmoving-picture hero?\"\n\nDown Gissing Street the younger man set so rapid a pace that his\ncompanion had to trot to keep abreast.  The placid vista of the little\nstreet was reassuring.  Under the glowing effusion of the shop windows\nthe pavement was a path of checkered brightness.  In Weintraub's\npharmacy they could see the pasty-faced assistant in his stained white\ncoat serving a beaker of hot chocolate.  In the stationer's shop people\nwere looking over trays of Christmas cards.  In the Milwaukee Lunch\nAubrey saw (and envied) a sturdy citizen peacefully dipping a doughnut\ninto a cup of coffee.\n\n\"This all seems very unreal,\" said Roger.\n\nAs they neared the bookshop, Aubrey's heart gave a jerk of\napprehension.  The blinds in the front windows had been drawn down.  A\ndull shining came through them, showing that the lights were turned on\ninside.  But why should the shades be lowered with closing time three\nhours away?\n\nThey reached the front door, and Aubrey was about to seize the handle\nwhen Roger halted him.\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" he said.  \"Let's go in quietly.  There may be\nsomething queer going on.\"\n\nAubrey turned the knob gently.  The door was locked.\n\nRoger pulled out his latchkey and cautiously released the bolt.  Then\nhe opened the door slightly--about an inch.\n\n\"You're taller than I am,\" he whispered.  \"Reach up and muffle the bell\nabove the door while I open it.\"\n\nAubrey thrust three fingers through the aperture and blocked the\ntrigger of the gong.  Then Roger pushed the door wide, and they tiptoed\nin.\n\nThe shop was empty, and apparently normal.  They stood for an instant\nwith pounding pulses.\n\nFrom the back of the house came a clear voice, a little tremulous:\n\n\"You can do what you like, I shan't tell you where it is.  Mr. Mifflin\nsaid----\"\n\nThere followed the bang of a falling chair, and a sound of rapid\nmovement.\n\nAubrey was down the aisle in a flash, followed by Roger, who had\ndelayed just long enough to close the door.  He tiptoed up the steps at\nthe back of the shop and looked into the dining room.  At the instant\nhis eyes took in the scene it seemed as though the whole room was in\nmotion.\n\nThe cloth was spread for supper and shone white under the drop lamp.\nIn the far corner of the room Titania was struggling in the grasp of a\nbearded man whom Aubrey instantly recognized as the chef.  On the near\nside of the table, holding a revolver levelled at the girl, stood\nWeintraub.  His back was toward the door.  Aubrey could see the\ndruggist's sullen jaw crease and shake with anger.\n\nTwo strides took him into the room.  He jammed the muzzle of his pistol\nagainst the oily cheek.  \"Drop it!\" he said hoarsely.  \"You Hun!\" With\nhis left hand he seized the man's shirt collar and drew it tight\nagainst the throat.  In his tremor of rage and excitement his arms felt\ncuriously weak, and his first thought was how impossible it would be to\nstrangle that swinish neck.\n\nFor an instant there was a breathless tableau.  The bearded man still\nhad his hands on Titania's shoulders.  She, very pale but with\nbrilliant eyes, gazed at Aubrey in unbelieving amazement.  Weintraub\nstood quite motionless with both hands on the dining table, as though\nthinking.  He felt the cold bruise of metal against the hollow of his\ncheek.  Slowly he opened his right hand and his revolver fell on the\nlinen cloth.  Then Roger burst into the room.\n\nTitania wrenched herself away from the chef.\n\n\"I wouldn't give them the suitcase!\" she cried.\n\nAubrey kept his pistol pinned against Weintraub's face.  With his left\nhand he picked up the druggist's revolver.  Roger was about to seize\nthe chef, who was standing uncertainly on the other side of the table.\n\n\"Here,\" said Aubrey, \"take this gun.  Cover this fellow and leave that\none to me.  I've got a score to settle with him.\"\n\nThe chef made a movement as though to jump through the window behind\nhim, but Aubrey flung himself upon him.  He hit the man square on the\nnose and felt a delicious throb of satisfaction as the rubbery flesh\nflattened beneath his knuckles.  He seized the man's hairy throat and\nsank his fingers into it.  The other tried to snatch the bread knife on\nthe table, but was too late.  He fell to the floor, and Aubrey\nthrottled him savagely.\n\n\"You blasted Hun,\" he grunted.  \"Go wrestling with girls, will you?\"\n\nTitania ran from the room, through the pantry.\n\nRoger was holding Weintraub's revolver in front of the German's face.\n\n\"Look here,\" he said, \"what does this mean?\"\n\n\"It's all a mistake,\" said the druggist suavely, though his eyes slid\nuneasily to and fro.  \"I just came in to get some books I left here\nearlier in the afternoon.\"\n\n\"With a revolver, eh?\" said Roger.  \"Speak up, Hindenburg, what's the\nbig idea?\"\n\n\"It's not my revolver,\" said Weintraub.  \"It's Metzger's.\"\n\n\"Where's this suitcase of yours?\" said Roger.  \"We're going to have a\nlook at it.\"\n\n\"It's all a stupid mistake,\" said Weintraub.  \"I left a suitcase of old\nbooks here for Metzger, because I expected to go out of town this\nafternoon.  He called for it, and your young woman wouldn't give it to\nhim.  He came to me, and I came down here to tell her it was all right.\"\n\n\"Is that Metzger?\" said Roger, pointing to the bearded man who was\ntrying to break Aubrey's grip.  \"Gilbert, don't choke that man, we want\nhim to do some explaining.\"\n\nAubrey got up, picked his revolver from the floor where he had dropped\nit, and prodded the chef to his feet.\n\n\"Well, you swine,\" he said, \"how did you enjoy falling downstairs the\nother evening?  As for you, Herr Weintraub, I'd like to know what kind\nof prescriptions you make up in that cellar of yours.\"\n\nWeintraub's face shone damply in the lamplight.  Perspiration was thick\non his forehead.\n\n\"My dear Mifflin,\" he said, \"this is awfully stupid.  In my eagerness,\nI'm afraid----\"\n\nTitania ran back into the room, followed by Helen, whose face was\ncrimson.\n\n\"Thank God you're back, Roger,\" she said.  \"These brutes tied me up in\nthe kitchen and gagged me with a roller-towel.  They threatened to\nshoot Titania if she wouldn't give them the suitcase.\"\n\nWeintraub began to say something, but Roger thrust the revolver between\nhis eyes.\n\n\"Hold your tongue!\" he said.  \"We're going to have a look at those\nbooks of yours.\"\n\n\"I'll get the suitcase,\" said Titania.  \"I hid it.  When Mr. Weintraub\ncame in and asked for it, at first I was going to give it to him, but\nhe looked so queer I thought something must be wrong.\"\n\n\"Don't you get it,\" said Aubrey, and their eyes met for the first time.\n\"Show me where it is, and we'll let friend Hun bring it.\"\n\nTitania flushed a little.  \"It's in my bedroom cupboard,\" she said.\n\nShe led the way upstairs, Metzger following, and Aubrey behind Metzger\nwith his pistol ready.  Outside the bedroom door Aubrey halted.  \"Show\nhim the suitcase and let him pick it up,\" he said.  \"If he makes a\nwrong movement, call me, and I'll shoot him.\"\n\nTitania pointed out the suitcase, which she had stowed at the back of\nher cupboard behind some clothes.  The chef showed no insubordination,\nand the three returned downstairs.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Roger.  \"We'll go down in the shop where we can see\nbetter.  Perhaps he's got a first folio Shakespeare in here.  Helen,\nyou go to the phone and ring up the McFee Street police station.  Ask\nthem to send a couple of men round here at once.\"\n\n\"My dear Mifflin,\" said Weintraub, \"this is very absurd.  Only a few\nold books that I had collected from time to time.\"\n\n\"I don't call it absurd when a man comes into my house and ties my wife\nup with clothesline and threatens to shoot a young girl,\" said Roger.\n\"We'll see what the police have to say about this, Weintraub.  Don't\nmake any mistake:  if you try to bolt I'll blow your brains out.\"\n\nAubrey led the way down into the shop while Metzger carried the\nsuitcase.  Roger and Weintraub followed, and Titania brought up the\nrear.  Under a bright light in the Essay alcove Aubrey made the chef\nlay the bag on the table.\n\n\"Open her up,\" he said curtly.\n\n\"It's nothing but some old books,\" said Metzger.\n\n\"If they're old enough they may be valuable,\" said Roger.  \"I'm\ninterested in old books.  Look sharp!\"\n\nMetzger drew a key from his pocket and unlocked the bag.  Aubrey held\nthe pistol at his head as he threw back the lid.\n\nThe suitcase was full of second-hand books closely packed together.\nRoger, with great presence of mind, was keeping his eyes on Weintraub.\n\n\"Tell me what's in it,\" he said.\n\n\"Why, it's only a lot of books, after all,\" cried Titania.\n\n\"You see,\" said Weintraub surlily, \"there's no mystery about it.  I'm\nsorry I was so----\"\n\n\"Oh, look!\" said Titania; \"There's the Cromwell book!\"\n\nFor an instant Roger forgot himself.  He looked instinctively at the\nsuitcase, and in that moment the druggist broke away, ran down the\naisle, and flew out of the door.  Roger dashed after him, but was too\nlate.  Aubrey was holding Metzger by the collar with the pistol at his\nhead.\n\n\"Good God,\" he said, \"why didn't you shoot?\"\n\n\"I don't know\" said Roger in confusion.  \"I was afraid of hitting him.\nNever mind, we can fix him later.\"\n\n\"The police will be here in a minute,\" said Helen, calling from the\ntelephone.  \"I'm going to let Bock in.  He's in the back yard.\"\n\n\"I think they're both crazy,\" said Titania.  \"Let's put the Cromwell\nback on the shelf and let this creature go.\"  She put out her hand for\nthe book.\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Aubrey, and seized her arm.  \"Don't touch that book!\"\n\nTitania shrank back, frightened by his voice.  Had everyone gone insane?\n\n\"Here, Mr. Metzger,\" said Aubrey, \"you put that book back on the shelf\nwhere it belongs.  Don't try to get away.  I've got this revolver\npointed at you.\"\n\nHe and Roger were both startled by the chef's face.  Above the unkempt\nbeard his eyes shone with a half-crazed lustre, and his hands shook.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said.  \"Show me where it goes.\"\n\n\"I'll show you,\" said Titania.\n\nAubrey put out his arm in front of the girl.  \"Stay where you are,\" he\nsaid angrily.\n\n\"Down in the History alcove,\" said Roger.  \"The front alcove on the\nother side of the shop.  We've both got you covered.\"\n\nInstead of taking the volume from the suitcase, Metzger picked up the\nwhole bag, holding it flat.  He carried it to the alcove they\nindicated.  He placed the case carefully on the floor, and picked the\nCromwell volume out of it.\n\n\"Where would you want it to go?\" he said in an odd voice.  \"This is a\nvaluable book.\"\n\n\"On the fifth shelf,\" said Roger.  \"Over there----\"\n\n\"For God's sake stand back,\" said Aubrey.  \"Don't go near him.  There's\nsomething damnable about this.\"\n\n\"You poor fools!\" cried Metzger harshly.  \"To hell with you and your\nold books.\"  He drew his hand back as though to throw the volume at\nthem.\n\nThere was a quick patter of feet, and Bock, growling, ran down the\naisle.  In the same instant, Aubrey, obeying some unexplained impulse,\ngave Roger a violent push back into the Fiction alcove, seized Titania\nroughly in his arms, and ran with her toward the back of the shop.\n\nMetzger's arm was raised, about to throw the book, when Bock darted at\nhim and buried his teeth in the man's leg.  The Cromwell fell from his\nhand.\n\nThere was a shattering explosion, a dull roar, and for an instant\nAubrey thought the whole bookshop had turned into a vast spinning top.\nThe floor rocked and sagged, shelves of books were hurled in every\ndirection.  Carrying Titania, he had just reached the steps leading to\nthe domestic quarters when they were flung sideways into the corner\nbehind Roger's desk.  The air was full of flying books.  A row of\nencyclopedias crashed down upon his shoulders, narrowly missing\nTitania's head.  The front windows were shivered into flying streamers\nof broken glass.  The table near the door was hurled into the opposite\ngallery.  With a splintering crash the corner of the gallery above the\nHistory alcove collapsed, and hundreds of volumes cascaded heavily on\nto the floor.  The lights went out, and for an instant all was silence.\n\n\"Are you all right?\" said Aubrey hastily.  He and Titania had fallen\nsprawling against the bookseller's desk.\n\n\"I think so,\" she said faintly.  \"Where's Mr. Mifflin?\"\n\nAubrey put out his hand to help her, and touched something wet on the\nfloor.  \"Good heavens,\" he thought.  \"She's dying!\" He struggled to his\nfeet in the darkness.  \"Hullo, Mr. Mifflin,\" he called, \"where are you?\"\n\nThere was no answer.\n\nA beam of light gushed out from the passageway behind the shop, and\npicking his way over fallen litter he found Mrs. Mifflin standing dazed\nby the dining-room door.  In the back of the house the lights were\nstill burning.\n\n\"For heaven's sake, have you a candle?\" he said.\n\n\"Where's Roger?\" she cried piteously, and stumbled into the kitchen.\n\nWith a candle Aubrey found Titania sitting on the floor, very faint,\nbut unhurt.  What he had thought was blood proved to be a pool of ink\nfrom a quart bottle that had stood over Roger's desk.  He picked her up\nlike a child and carried her into the kitchen.  \"Stay here and don't\nstir,\" he said.\n\nBy this time a crowd was already gathering on the pavement.  Someone\ncame in with a lantern.  Three policemen appeared at the door.\n\n\"For God's sake,\" cried Aubrey, \"get a light in here so we can see\nwhat's happened.  Mifflin's buried in this mess somewhere.  Someone\nring for an ambulance.\"\n\nThe whole front of the Haunted Bookshop was a wreck.  In the pale\nglimmer of the lantern it was a disastrous sight.  Helen groped her way\ndown the shattered aisle.\n\n\"Where was he?\" she cried wildly.\n\n\"Thanks to that set of Trollope,\" said a voice in the remains of the\nFiction alcove, \"I think I'm all right.  Books make good\nshock-absorbers.  Is any one hurt?\"\n\nIt was Roger, half stunned, but undamaged.  He crawled out from under a\ncase of shelves that had crumpled down upon him.\n\n\"Bring that lantern over here,\" said Aubrey, pointing to a dark heap\nlying on the floor under the broken fragments of Roger's bulletin board.\n\nIt was the chef.  He was dead.  And clinging to his leg was all that\nwas left of Bock.\n\n\n\nChapter XV\n\nMr. Chapman Waves His Wand\n\n\nGissing Street will not soon forget the explosion at the Haunted\nBookshop.  When it was learned that the cellar of Weintraub's pharmacy\ncontained just the information for which the Department of Justice had\nbeen looking for four years, and that the inoffensive German-American\ndruggist had been the artisan of hundreds of incendiary bombs that had\nbeen placed on American and Allied shipping and in ammunition\nplants--and that this same Weintraub had committed suicide when\narrested on Bromfield Street in Boston the next day--Gissing Street\nhummed with excitement.  The Milwaukee Lunch did a roaring business\namong the sensation seekers who came to view the ruins of the bookshop.\nWhen it became known that fragments of a cabin plan of the George\nWashington had been found in Metzger's pocket, and the confession of an\naccomplice on the kitchen staff of the Octagon Hotel showed that the\nbomb, disguised as a copy of one of Woodrow Wilson's favourite books,\nwas to have been placed in the Presidential suite of the steamship,\nindignation knew no bounds.  Mrs. J. F. Smith left Mrs. Schiller's\nlodgings, declaring that she would stay no longer in a pro-German\ncolony; and Aubrey was able at last to get a much-needed bath.\n\nFor the next three days he was too busy with agents of the Department\nof Justice to be able to carry on an investigation of his own that\ngreatly occupied his mind.  But late on Friday afternoon he called at\nthe bookshop to talk things over.\n\nThe debris had all been neatly cleared away, and the shattered front of\nthe building boarded up.  Inside, Aubrey found Roger seated on the\nfloor, looking over piles of volumes that were heaped pell-mell around\nhim.  Through Mr. Chapman's influence with a well-known firm of\nbuilders, the bookseller had been able to get men to work at once in\nmaking repairs, but even so it would be at least ten days, he said,\nbefore he could reopen for business.  \"I hate to lose the value of all\nthis advertising,\" he lamented.  \"It isn't often that a second-hand\nbookstore gets onto the front pages of the newspapers.\"\n\n\"I thought you didn't believe in advertising,\" said Aubrey.\n\n\"The kind of advertising I believe in,\" said Roger, \"is the kind that\ndoesn't cost you anything.\"\n\nAubrey smiled as he looked round at the dismantled shop.  \"It seems to\nme that this'll cost you a tidy bit when the bill comes in.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said Roger, \"This is just what I needed.  I was\ngetting into a rut.  The explosion has blown out a whole lot of books I\nhad forgotten about and didn't even know I had.  Look, here's an old\ncopy of How to Be Happy Though Married, which I see the publisher lists\nas 'Fiction.' Here's Urn Burial, and The Love Affairs of a\nBibliomaniac, and Mistletoe's Book of Deplorable Facts.  I'm going to\nhave a thorough house-cleaning.  I'm thinking seriously of putting in a\nvacuum cleaner and a cash register.  Titania was quite right, the place\nwas too dirty.  That girl has given me a lot of ideas.\"\n\nAubrey wanted to ask where she was, but didn't like to say so\npoint-blank.\n\n\"There's no question about it,\" said Roger, \"an explosion now and then\ndoes one good.  Since the reporters got here and dragged the whole yarn\nout of us, I've had half a dozen offers from publishers for my book, a\nlyceum bureau wants me to lecture on Bookselling as a Form of Public\nService, I've had five hundred letters from people asking when the shop\nwill reopen for business, and the American Booksellers' Association has\ninvited me to give an address at its convention next spring.  It's the\nfirst recognition I've ever had.  If it weren't for poor dear old\nBock----  Come, we've buried him in the back yard.  I want to show you\nhis grave.\"\n\nOver a pathetically small mound near the fence a bunch of big yellow\nchrysanthemums were standing in a vase.\n\n\"Titania put those there,\" said Roger.  \"She says she's going to plant\na dogwood tree there in the spring.  We intend to put up a little stone\nfor him, and I'm trying to think of an inscription, I thought of De\nMortuis Nil Nisi Bonum, but that's a bit too flippant.\"\n\nThe living quarters of the house had not been damaged by the explosion,\nand Roger took Aubrey back to the den.  \"You've come just at the right\ntime,\" he said.  \"Mr. Chapman's coming to dinner this evening, and\nwe'll all have a good talk.  There's a lot about this business I don't\nunderstand yet.\"\n\nAubrey was still keeping his eye open for a sign of Titania's presence,\nand Roger noticed his wandering gaze.\n\n\"This is Miss Chapman's afternoon off,\" he said.  \"She got her first\nsalary to-day, and was so much exhilarated that she went to New York to\nblow it in.  She's out with her father.  Excuse me, please, I'm going\nto help Helen get dinner ready.\"\n\nAubrey sat down by the fire, and lit his pipe.  The burden of his\nmeditation was that it was just a week since he had first met Titania,\nand in all that week there had been no waking moment when he had not\nthought of her.  He was wondering how long it might take for a girl to\nfall in love?  A man--he knew now--could fall in love in five minutes,\nbut how did it work with girls?  He was also thinking what unique\nDaintybits advertising copy he could build (like all ad men he always\nspoke of building an ad, never of writing one) out of this affair if he\ncould only use the inside stuff.\n\nHe heard a rustle behind him, and there she was.  She had on a gray fur\ncoat and a lively little hat.  Her cheeks were delicately tinted by the\nwinter air.  Aubrey rose.\n\n\"Why, Mr. Gilbert!\" she said.  \"Where have you been keeping yourself\nwhen I wanted to see you so badly?  I haven't seen you, not to talk to,\nsince last Sunday.\"\n\nHe found it impossible to say anything intelligible.  She threw off her\ncoat, and went on, with a wistful gravity that became her even more\nthan smiles:\n\n\"Mr. Mifflin has told me some more about what you did last week--I\nmean, how you took a room across the street and spied upon that hateful\nman and saw through the whole thing when we were too blind to know what\nwas going on.  And I want to apologize for the silly things I said that\nSunday morning.  Will you forgive me?\"\n\nAubrey had never felt his self-salesmanship ability at such a low ebb.\nTo his unspeakable horror, he felt his eyes betray him.  They grew\nmoist.\n\n\"Please don't talk like that,\" he said.  \"I had no right to do what I\ndid, anyway.  And I was wrong in what I said about Mr. Mifflin.  I\ndon't wonder you were angry.\"\n\n\"Now surely you're not going to deprive me of the pleasure of thanking\nyou,\" she said.  \"You know as well as I do that you saved my life--all\nour lives, that night.  I guess you'd have saved poor Bock's, too, if\nyou could.\"  Her eyes filled with tears.\n\n\"If anybody deserves credit, it's you,\" he said.  \"Why, if it hadn't\nbeen for you they'd have been away with that suitcase and probably\nMetzger would have got his bomb on board the ship and blown up the\nPresident----\"\n\n\"I'm not arguing with you,\" she said.  \"I'm just thanking you.\"\n\nIt was a happy little party that sat down in Roger's dining room that\nevening.  Helen had prepared Eggs Samuel Butler in Aubrey's honour, and\nMr. Chapman had brought two bottles of champagne to pledge the future\nsuccess of the bookshop.  Aubrey was called upon to announce the result\nof his conferences with the secret service men who had been looking up\nWeintraub's record.\n\n\"It all seems so simple now,\" he said, \"that I wonder we didn't see\nthrough it at once.  You see, we all made the mistake of assuming that\nGerman plotting would stop automatically when the armistice was signed.\nIt seems that this man Weintraub was one of the most dangerous spies\nGermany had in this country.  Thirty or forty fires and explosions on\nour ships at sea are said to have been due to his work.  As he had\nlived here so long and taken out citizen's papers, no one suspected\nhim.  But after his death, his wife, whom he had treated very brutally,\ngave way and told a great deal about his activities.  According to her,\nas soon as it was announced that the President would go to the Peace\nConference, Weintraub made up his mind to get a bomb into the\nPresident's cabin on board the George Washington.  Mrs. Weintraub tried\nto dissuade him from it, as she was in secret opposed to these\nmurderous plots of his, but he threatened to kill her if she thwarted\nhim.  She lived in terror of her life.  I can believe it, for I\nremember her face when her husband looked at her.\n\n\"Of course to make the bomb was simple enough for Weintraub.  He had an\ninfernally complete laboratory in the cellar of his house, where he had\nmade hundreds.  The problem was, how to make a bomb that would not look\nsuspicious, and how to get it into the President's private cabin.  He\nhit on the idea of binding it into the cover of a book.  How he came to\nchoose that particular volume, I don't know.\"\n\n\"I think probably I gave him the idea quite innocently,\" said Roger.\n\"He used to come in here a good deal and one day he asked me whether\nMr. Wilson was a great reader.  I said that I believed he was, and then\nmentioned the Cromwell, which I had heard was one of Wilson's favourite\nbooks.  Weintraub was much interested and said he must read the book\nsome day.  I remember now that he stood in that alcove for some time,\nlooking over it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Aubrey, \"it must have seemed to him that luck was playing\ninto his hands.  This man Metzger, who had been an assistant chef at\nthe Octagon for years, was slated to go on board the George Washington\nwith the party of cooks from that hotel who were to prepare the\nPresident's meals.  Weintraub was informed of all this from someone\nhigher up in the German spy organization.  Metzger, who was known as\nMessier at the hotel, was a very clever chef, and had fake passports as\na Swiss citizen.  He was another tool of the organization.  By the\noriginal scheme there would have been no direct communication between\nWeintraub and Metzger, but the go-between was spotted by the Department\nof Justice on another count, and is now behind bars at Atlanta.\n\n\"It seems that Weintraub had conceived the idea that the least\nsuspicious way of passing his messages to Metzger would be to slip them\ninto a copy of some book--a book little likely to be purchased--in a\nsecond-hand bookshop.  Metzger had been informed what the book was,\nbut--perhaps owing to the unexpected removal of the go-between--did not\nknow in which shop he was to find it.  That explains why so many\nbooksellers had inquiries from him recently for a copy of the Cromwell\nvolume.\n\n\"Weintraub, of course, was not at all anxious to have any direct\ndealings with Metzger, as the druggist had a high regard for his own\nskin.  When the chef was finally informed where the bookshop was in\nwhich he was to see the book, he hurried over here.  Weintraub had\npicked out this shop not only because it was as unlikely as any place\non earth to be suspected as a channel of spy codes, but also because he\nhad your confidence and could drop in frequently without arousing\nsurprise.  The first time Metzger came here happened to be the night I\ndined with you, as you remember.\"\n\nRoger nodded.  \"He asked for the book, and to my surprise, it wasn't\nthere.\"\n\n\"No:  for the excellent reason that Weintraub had taken it some days\nbefore, to measure it so he could build his infernal machine to fit,\nand also to have it rebound.  He needed the original binding as a case\nfor his bomb.  The following night, as you told me, it came back.  He\nbrought it himself, having provided himself with a key to your front\ndoor.\"\n\n\"It was gone again on Thursday night, when the Corn Cob Club met here,\"\nsaid Mr. Chapman.\n\n\"Yes, that time Metzger had taken it,\" said Aubrey.  \"He misunderstood\nhis instructions, and thought he was to steal the book.  You see, owing\nto the absence of their third man, they were working at cross purposes.\nMetzger, I think, was only intended to get his information out of the\nbook, and leave it where it was.  At any rate, he was puzzled, and\ninserted that ad in the Times the next morning--that LOST ad, you\nremember.  By that, I imagine, he intended to convey the idea that he\nhad located the bookshop, but didn't know what to do next.  And the\ndate he mentioned in the ad, midnight on Tuesday, December third, was\nto inform Weintraub (of whose identity he was still ignorant) when\nMetzger was to go on board the ship.  Weintraub had been instructed by\ntheir spy organization to watch the LOST and FOUND ads.\"\n\n\"Think of it!\" cried Titania.\n\n\"Well,\" continued Aubrey, \"all this may not be 100 per cent.  accurate,\nbut after putting things together this is how it dopes out.  Weintraub,\nwho was as canny as they make them, saw he'd have to get into direct\ntouch with Metzger.  He sent him word, on the Friday, to come over to\nsee him and bring the book.  Metzger, meanwhile, had had a bad fright\nwhen I spoke to him in the hotel elevator.  He returned the book to the\nshop that night, as Mrs. Mifflin remembers.  Then, when I stopped in at\nthe drug store on my way home, he must have been with Weintraub.  I\nfound the Cromwell cover in the drug-store bookcase--why Weintraub was\ncareless enough to leave it there I can't guess--and they spotted me\nright away as having some kind of hunch.  So they followed me over the\nBridge and tried to get rid of me.  It was because I got that cover on\nFriday night that Weintraub broke into the shop again early Sunday\nmorning.  He had to have the cover of the book to bind his bomb in.\"\n\nAubrey was agreeably conscious of the close attention of his audience.\nHe caught Titania's gaze, and flushed a little.\n\n\"That's pretty nearly all there is to it,\" he said.  \"I knew that if\nthose guys were so keen to put me out of the way there must be\nsomething rather rotten on foot.  I came over to Brooklyn the next\nafternoon, Saturday, and took a room across the street.\"\n\n\"And we went to the movies,\" chirped Titania.\n\n\"The rest of it I think you all know--except Metzger's visit to my\nlodgings that night.\"  He described the incident.  \"You see they were\ntrailing me pretty close.  If I hadn't happened to notice the cigar at\nmy window I guess he'd have had me on toast.  Of course you know how\nwrongly I doped it out.  I thought Mr. Mifflin was running with them,\nand I owe him my apology for that.  He's laid me out once on that\nscore, over in Philadelphia.\"\n\nHumourously, Aubrey narrated how he had sleuthed the bookseller to\nLudlow Street, and had been worsted in battle.\n\n\"I think they counted on disposing of me sooner or later,\" said Aubrey.\n\"They framed up that telephone call to get Mr. Mifflin out of town.\nThe point in having Metzger come to the bookshop to get the suitcase\nwas to clear Weintraub's skirts if possible.  Apparently it was just a\nbag of old books.  The bombed book, I guess, was perfectly harmless\nuntil any one tried to open it.\"\n\n\"You both got back just in the nick of time,\" said Titania admiringly.\n\"You see I was all alone most of the afternoon.  Weintraub left the\nsuitcase about two o'clock.  Metzger came for it about six.  I refused\nto let him have it.  He was very persistent, and I had to threaten to\nset Bock at him.  It was all I could do to hold the dear old dog in, he\nwas so keen to go for Metzger.  The chef went away, and I suppose he\nwent up to see Weintraub about it.  I hid the suitcase in my room.  Mr.\nMifflin had forbidden me to touch it, but I thought that the safest\nthing to do.  Then Mrs. Mifflin came in.  We let Bock into the yard for\na run, and were getting supper.  I heard the bell ring, and went into\nthe shop.  There were the two Germans, pulling down the shades.  I\nasked what they meant by it, and they grabbed me and told me to shut\nup.  Then Metzger pointed a pistol at me while the other one tied up\nMrs. Mifflin.\"\n\n\"The damned scoundrels!\" cried Aubrey.  \"They got what was coming to\nthem.\"\n\n\"Well, my friends,\" said Mr. Chapman, \"Let's thank heaven that it ended\nno worse.  Mr. Gilbert, I haven't told you yet how I feel about the\nwhole affair.  That'll come later.  I'd like to propose the health of\nMr. Aubrey Gilbert, who is certainly the hero of this film!\"\n\nThey drank the toast with cheers, and Aubrey blushed becomingly.\n\n\"Oh, I forgot something!\" cried Titania.  \"When I went shopping this\nafternoon I stopped in at Brentano's, and was lucky enough to find just\nwhat I wanted.  It's for Mr. Gilbert, as a souvenir of the Haunted\nBookshop.\"\n\nShe ran to the sideboard and brought back a parcel.\n\nAubrey opened it with delighted agitation.  It was a copy of Carlyle's\nCromwell.  He tried to stammer his thanks, but what he saw--or thought\nhe saw--in Titania's sparkling face--unmanned him.\n\n\"The same edition!\" said Roger.  \"Now let's see what those mystic page\nnumbers are!  Gilbert, have you got your memorandum?\"\n\nAubrey took out his notebook.  \"Here we are,\" he said.  \"This is what\nWeintraub wrote in the back of the cover.\"\n\n                    153 (3) 1, 2.\n\nRoger glanced at the notation.\n\n\"That ought to be easy,\" he said.  \"You see in this edition three\nvolumes are bound in one.  Let's look at page 153 in the third volume,\nthe first and second lines.\"\n\nAubrey turned to the place.  He read, and smiled.\n\n\"Right you are,\" he said.\n\n\"Read it!\" they all cried.\n\n\"To seduce the Protector's guard, to blow up the Protector in his\nbedroom, and do other little fiddling things.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't wonder if that's where he got his idea,\" said Roger.\n\"What have I been saying right along--that books aren't merely dead\nthings!\"\n\n\"Good gracious,\" said Titania.  \"You told me that books are explosives.\nYou were right, weren't you!  But it's lucky Mr. Gilbert didn't hear\nyou say it or he'd certainly have suspected you!\"\n\n\"The joke is on me,\" said Roger.\n\n\"Well, I'VE got a toast to propose,\" said Titania.  \"Here's to the\nmemory of Bock, the dearest, bravest dog I ever met!\"\n\nThey drank it with due gravity.\n\n\"Well, good people,\" said Mr. Chapman, \"there's nothing we can do for\nBock now.  But we can do something for the rest of us.  I've been\ntalking with Titania, Mr. Mifflin.  I'm bound to say that after this\ndisaster my first thought was to get her out of the book business as\nfast as I could.  I thought it was a little too exciting for her.  You\nknow I sent her over here to have a quiet time and calm down a bit.\nBut she wouldn't hear of leaving.  And if I'm going to have a family\ninterest in the book business I want to do something to justify it.  I\nknow your idea about travelling book-wagons, and taking literature into\nthe countryside.  Now if you and Mrs. Mifflin can find the proper\npeople to run them, I'll finance a fleet of ten of those Parnassuses\nyou're always talking about, and have them built in time to go on the\nroad next spring.  How about it?\"\n\nRoger and Helen looked at each other, and at Mr. Chapman.  In a flash\nRoger saw one of his dearest dreams coming true.  Titania, to whom this\nwas a surprise, leaped from her chair and ran to kiss her father,\ncrying, \"Oh, Daddy, you ARE a darling!\"\n\nRoger rose solemnly and gave Mr. Chapman his hand.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" he said, \"Miss Titania has found the right word.  You\nare an honour to human nature, sir, and I hope you'll never live to\nregret it.  This is the happiest moment of my life.\"\n\n\"Then that's settled,\" said Mr. Chapman.  \"We'll go over the details\nlater.  Now there's another thing on my mind.  Perhaps I shouldn't\nbring up business matters here, but this is a kind of family party--Mr.\nGilbert, it's my duty to inform you that I intend to take my\nadvertising out of the hands of the Grey-Matter Agency.\" Aubrey's heart\nsank.  He had feared a catastrophe of this kind from the first.\nNaturally a hard-headed business man would not care to entrust such\nvast interests to a firm whose young men went careering about like\nsecret service agents, hunting for spies, eavesdropping in alleys, and\naccusing people of pro-germanism.  Business, Aubrey said to himself, is\nbuilt upon Confidence, and what confidence could Mr. Chapman have in\nsuch vagabond and romantic doings?  Still, he felt that he had done\nnothing to be ashamed of.\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir,\" he said.  \"We have tried to give you service.  I\nassure you that I've spent by far the larger part of my time at the\noffice in working up plans for your campaigns.\"\n\nHe could not bear to look at Titania, ashamed that she should be the\nwitness of his humiliation.\n\n\"That's exactly it,\" said Mr. Chapman.  \"I don't want just the larger\npart of your time.  I want all of it.  I want you to accept the\nposition of assistant advertising manager of the Daintybits\nCorporation.\"\n\nThey all cheered, and for the third time that evening Aubrey felt more\noverwhelmed than any good advertising man is accustomed to feel.  He\ntried to express his delight, and then added:\n\n\"I think it's my turn to propose a toast.  I give you the health of Mr.\nand Mrs. Mifflin, and their Haunted Bookshop, the place where I\nfirst--I first----\"\n\nHis courage failed him, and he concluded, \"First learned the meaning of\nliterature.\"\n\n\"Suppose we adjourn to the den,\" said Helen.  \"We have so many\ndelightful things to talk over, and I know Roger wants to tell you all\nabout the improvements he is planning for the shop.\"\n\nAubrey lingered to be the last, and it is to be conjectured that\nTitania did not drop her handkerchief merely by accident.  The others\nhad already crossed the hall into the sitting room.\n\nTheir eyes met, and Aubrey could feel himself drowned in her steady,\nhonest gaze.  He was tortured by the bliss of being so near her, and\nalone.  The rest of the world seemed to shred away and leave them\nstanding in that little island of light where the tablecloth gleamed\nunder the lamp.\n\nIn his hand he clutched the precious book.  Out of all the thousand\nthings he thought, there was only one he dared to say.\n\n\"Will you write my name in it?\"\n\n\"I'd love to,\" she said, a little shakily, for she, too, was strangely\nalarmed at certain throbbings.\n\nHe gave her his pen, and she sat down at the table.  She wrote quickly\n\n\n                 For Aubrey Gilbert\n                   From Titania Chapman\n                       With much gr\n\n\nShe paused.\n\n\"Oh,\" she said quickly.  \"Do I have to finish it now?\"\n\nShe looked up at him, with the lamplight shining on her vivid face.\nAubrey felt oddly stupefied, and was thinking only of the little golden\nsparkle of her eyelashes.  This time her eyes were the first to turn\naway.\n\n\"You see,\" she said with a funny little quaver, \"I might want to change\nthe wording.\"  And she ran from the room.\n\nAs she entered the den, her father was speaking.  \"You know,\" he said,\n\"I'm rather glad she wants to stay in the book business.\" Roger looked\nup at her.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I believe it agrees with her!  You know, the beauty\nof living in a place like this is that you get so absorbed in the books\nyou don't have any temptation to worry about anything else.  The people\nin books become more real to you than any one in actual life.\"\n\nTitania, sitting on the arm of Mrs. Mifflin's chair, took Helen's hand,\nunobserved by the others.  They smiled at each other slyly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Haunted Bookshop, by Christopher Morley\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE HAUNTED BOOKSHOP ***\n\n***** This file should be named 172.txt or 172.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/7\/172\/\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":233,"split":"train"}
