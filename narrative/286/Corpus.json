{"ori_id":"42932ecf4fcb1f2a61d060abc3a8945149efeb61","title":"Saving Mr. Banks","context":"Saving Mr. Banks\n In 1961, the financially strapped author Pamela \"P. L.\" Travers reluctantly travels from her home in London to Los Angeles to work with Walt Disney at the urging of her agent, Diarmuid Russell. Disney has pursued the film rights to her Mary Poppins stories for twenty years, having promised his daughters that he would produce a film based on them. Travers has steadfastly resisted Disney's efforts because she fears what he would do to her character. However, she has not written anything in a while and her book royalties have dwindled to nothing, so she risks losing her house. Still, Russell has to remind her that Disney has agreed to two major stipulations\u00e2\u0080\u0094no animation and unprecedented script approval\u00e2\u0080\u0094before she agrees to go.\nTravers' difficult childhood in Allora, Queensland, Australia, is depicted through flashbacks, and is the inspiration for much of Mary Poppins. Travers idolized her loving, imaginative father, Travers Robert Goff, but his chronic alcoholism resulted in his repeated firings, strained her parents' marriage, and caused her distressed mother to attempt suicide. Goff died at an early age from tuberculosis when Travers was seven years old.\nIn Los Angeles, Travers is irritated by what she perceives as the city's unreality and the inhabitants' intrusive friendliness, personified by her limousine driver, Ralph. At the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, Travers meets the creative team that are developing Mary Poppins for the screen: screenwriter Don DaGradi, and music composers Richard and Robert Sherman. She finds their presumptions and casual manners highly improper, a view she also holds of the jocular Disney.\nTravers' working relationship with Disney and his team is difficult from the outset, with her insistence that Mary Poppins is the enemy of sentiment and whimsy. Disney and his people are puzzled by Travers' disdain for fantasy, given the nature of the Mary Poppins story, as well as Travers' own rich imagination. She particularly objects to how the character George Banks, the estranged father of the children in Mary Poppins' charge, is depicted, insisting that he is neither cold nor cruel. Gradually, they grasp how deeply personal the Mary Poppins stories are to her and how many of the characters were inspired by her past.\nThe team realize Travers has valid criticisms and make changes, though she becomes increasingly disengaged as painful childhood memories resurface. Seeking to understand what troubles her, Disney invites Travers to Disneyland, which, along with her developing friendship with Ralph, the creative team's revisions to the George Banks character, and the addition of a new song and a different ending, help dissolve Travers' opposition. Her creativity reawakens, and she begins working with the team; however, when Travers discovers that there is to be an animation sequence, she confronts Disney over his broken promise and returns home.\nDisney learns that Travers is actually her pen name, taken from her father's given name. Her real name is Helen Goff, and she's actually Australian, not British. This gives Disney new insight into Travers, and he follows her to London. Arriving unexpectedly at her door, Disney tells her that he also had a less-than-ideal childhood, but stresses the healing value of his art. He urges Travers to not let deeply-rooted past disappointments dictate the present. Travers relents and grants Disney the film rights.\nThree years later, in 1964, Mary Poppins is to have its world premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Disney has not invited Travers, fearing how she might react with the press watching. Prompted by Russell, Travers shows up unannounced at Disney's office; he reluctantly issues her an invitation. Initially, she watches Mary Poppins with a lack of enthusiasm, particularly during the animated sequences. She gradually warms to the rest of the film; however, becoming deeply moved by the depiction of George Banks' personal crisis and redemption.\n<html>\n<head><title>Saving Mr. Banks Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Saving Mr. Banks script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Saving Mr. Banks script, Saving Mr. Banks movie script, Saving Mr. Banks film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

And, of course, the ubiquitous\n          stuffed Mickey Mouse.\n\n<b>                          PAMELA\n<\/b>\n<b>                          (TO MICKEY)\n<\/b>           I thought I left you in London.\n\n                         \n\n<b>          EXT.

Pamela doesn't dare get her hopes up\n          but the door swings open and there he is, her favorite person\n          in America.\n\n<b>                          RALPH\n<\/b>           Had a feeling a certain friend of\n           mine might be needing me tonight.\n\n<b>                          PAMELA\n<\/b>           Ralph!\n          She rushes to him and they give each other a friendly hug.\n\n<b>                          RALPH\n<\/b>           You look like a million bucks!\n           Let's get you to the ball.\n          He opens the back door for her and she climbs in.\n\n                         \n\n<b>          EXT.

Bulbs\n          flash continuously as limo after limo pulls up at the red\n          carpet. Ushers are dressed as English bobbies. Reporters\n          stand on podiums in colourful suits, Penguins dance their\n          hearts out in front of the theater. Pearly Kings and Queens\n          play for the onlookers. Crowds and crowds of fans scream\n          every time a bulb flashes, waving their autograph books and\n          posters in the air. Every Disney character imaginable bounces\n          up and down the lines of well-wishers, hugging them, dancing\n          for them, signing their booklets. Hollywood Blvd is\n          completely shut down and the atmosphere is like the happiest\n          party you could ever go to.\n\n                         \n\n<b>          INT.

Pamela is nervous, everyone else has someone with\n          them but Pamela must brave the crowd alone.\n\n                         \n\n<b>          EXT.

It's too much.\n\n<b>                          RALPH\n<\/b>           (in her ear)\n           This is your night. None of this\n           would be possible without you.\n          She brings her arm down, straightens her dress and breaks\n          into a smile, making her way down the carpet to frantic\n          whispers amongst the press and autograph hunters of: \"Who is\n          that?\" \"Is that anyone?\" Pamela spots Walt, Dick Van Dyke and\n          Julie Andrews being interviewed together up ahead.\n          Mickey Mouse bounces down the carpet and slows-- he and\n          Pamela lock eyes for a brief moment. He holds out his gloved\n          hand, she takes it and together they watch as a huge toy\n          train chugs to a halt on the blvd and hundreds upon hundreds\n          of coloured balloons fly out of it's roof and into the air.\n\n                         \n\n<b>          EXT.

GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT\n<\/b>\n          The auditorium is jam packed. Pamela is seated in front of\n          Walt Disney. Don, the Shermans and their families are in the\n          same row as her - Bob Sherman next to her. The lights begin\n          to dim. The overture begins--\n          We stay close on Pamela as the sounds of the overture fade\n          and the melody of a single tin whistle playing one of Travers\n          old melody's rings in her ears.\n          We hear snippets of the film in the background but we remain\n          with Pamela.\n          She looks around at the faces in the audience - laughing,\n          humming, sad, happy, joyous.\n          Intercut with images from Pamela's childhood and the voices\n          of Bert and Jane -\n          Ellie's parrot head umbrella--\n\n<b>                          BERT\n<\/b>           You know, begging your pardon, but\n           the one my heart goes out to is\n           your father.\n          The carousel horses at the Allora fair--\n\n<b>                          BERT (CONT'D)\n<\/b>           There he is in that cold, heartless\n           bank day after day, hemmed in by\n           mounds of cold, heartless\n           money.\n          The tuppence and rolling pears--\n\n<b>                          BERT (CONT'D)\n<\/b>           I don't like to see any living\n           thing caged up.\n          Uncle Albert with Ginty on his back, carrying her river\n          soaked mother back to the house--\n\n<b>                          JANE\n<\/b>           Father in a cage?\n          Ginty pressing the final bottle into her father's hand--\n\n<b>                          BERT\n<\/b>           They makes cages in all sizes and\n           shapes, you know.\n          The image of the dead Travers in his bloodstained bed--\n\n<b>                          BERT (CONT'D)\n<\/b>           Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets\n           and all.\n\n<b>                          DISSOLVE TO:\n<\/b>          Children in the audience, their little faces tilted upwards.\n          Rapt.\n\n<b>                          MICHEAL\n<\/b>           You won't ever leave us will you?\n\n<b>                          JANE\n<\/b>           Whatever would we do without you?\n\n<b>                          MARY POPPINS\n<\/b>           I shall stay until the wind\n           changes.\n          And then an image from the film:\n          George Banks walks away from us down the misty tree-lined\n          London street, on his way to be fired from the bank.\n          Walt Disney watches with quiet satisfaction.\n          Pamela however has tears coursing down her face. Her\n          shoulders heave as she tries desperately not to sob out loud\n          but people are noticing, looking at her.\n          Disney leans forward, placing a hand on her shoulder. She\n          reaches up and grips it tightly, unable to speak.\n\n<b>                          WALT\n<\/b>           It's all right, Mrs Travers. It's\n           alright. Mr Banks is going to be\n           all right. I promise.\n          Pamela nods in gratitude, but cannot contain her sobs.

The audience around her are\n          smiling, laughing, singing along. Pamela, the tears, silent\n          now, still pouring down her cheeks as she slowly begins to\n          mouth along with the lyrics.\n          And in her head one final image appears.\n          Travers gaze falls upon Ginty, outside his bedroom window,\n          sweeping. Their eyes meet for a brief moment, an unspoken\n          understanding of what is to come, before his close with\n          tiredness.\n\n<b>           TRAVERS (V.O.)\n<\/b>           Never.
