On one such trip from Paris, Comte Hugret de S\u00e9rizy, a senator and wealthy aristocrat, is travelling incognito in order to investigate reports that Monsieur Moreau, the steward of his country estate at Presles, is being less than honest in his dealings on the count's behalf with a neighbouring landowner Margueron, a piece of whose land the count wishes to buy.\nAmong the count's fellow passengers is Oscar Husson, a young good-for-nothing mummy's boy, who is being sent to a friend of his mother's Monsieur Moreau in the hope that a position can be found for him. Also travelling to L'Isle-Adam is Georges Marest, the second clerk of the count's Parisian notary Crottat; Joseph Bridau, a young artist, who is accompanied by his young colleague L\u00e9on Didas y Lora, nicknamed Mistigris. The final occupant of the coach is P\u00e8re L\u00e9ger, a rich farmer from Val-d'Oise who is leasing the land which the count wishes to buy from Margueron. L\u00e9ger is hoping to buy it himself and then sell it piecemeal at a significant profit to the count.\nTo pass the time Georges amuses himself by pretending to be Colonel Czerni-Georges, a young nobleman with a distinguished military career behind him; his fellow travellers are impressed, but the count sees through him and realizes his true identity. Not to be outdone by Marest, the young painter then passes himself off as the celebrated artist Heinrich Schinner. Things become interesting when Oscar joins in and pretends to be a close acquaintance of the Comte de S\u00e9rizy and his son. In the course of his boasting, he divulges several private and embarrassing details about the count - details which he could only have learnt from his godparents the Moreaus.\nOn the journey the count also overhears a conversation in which L\u00e9ger describes how he and Moreau are conspiring to buy the land the count wants from under his nose and sell it to him at an inflated price.\nWhen the count arrives at Presles he wastes little time dismissing Moreau - not so much for conspiring with L\u00e9ger as for revealing personal details about the count and his wife to his godson. Oscar is forced to return to Paris and seek a living by some other means.\nIn time Oscar obtains a license and becomes a clerk in the law office of Desroches in Paris, where he is trained by Godeschal. During this time he renews his acquaintance with Georges Marest, who is actually related to him. For some time Oscar defies everyone's expectations and applies himself diligently to both his studies and his clerkly duties. But Oscar spoils everything by another indiscretion, this one much more serious than the first. At the house of demimondaine Florentine Cabirolle, who was then maintained by Oscar's wealthy uncle Cardot, Oscar gambles away five hundred francs he was given to transact an important legal matter. His hopes ruined for a second time, Oscar is forced to abandon law and enter military service.\nOnce again, he surprises everybody and becomes a successful soldier. He joins the cavalry regiment of the Duc de Maufrigneuse and the Vicomte de S\u00e9rizy, son of the Comte de S\u00e9rizy - the same young nobleman Oscar claimed to be acquainted with in the coach on the road to L'Isle-Adam. The interest of the dauphiness and of Abb\u00e9 Gaudron obtain for him promotion and a decoration. He becomes in turn aide-de-camp to La Fayette, captain, officer of the Legion of Honor and lieutenant-colonel. A noteworthy deed made him famous on Algerian territory during the affair of La Macta; Husson lost his left arm rescuing the mortally wounded Vicomte de S\u00e9rizy from the battlefield. Although the vicomte dies shortly afterwards, the Comte de S\u00e9rizy is grateful and forgives Oscar for his earlier indiscretion.\nPut on half-pay, Oscar obtains the post of collector for Beaumont-sur-Oise.\nAt the end of the novel, Oscar and his mother are taking the Pierrotin coach to L'Isle-Adam, en route to Beaumont-sur-Oise, and find themselves in the company of several witnesses or accomplices of Oscar's earlier indiscretions: Georges Marest has lost by debauchery a fortune worth thirty thousand francs a year, and is now a poor insurance-broker; P\u00e8re L\u00e9ger is now married to the daughter of the new steward of Presles Reybert; Joseph Bridau is now a celebrated artist and married to L\u00e9ger's daughter; Moreau, whose daughter is riding in another part of the same coach, has risen to high political office.\nWhen Georges begins to blab about the Moreaus, Oscar - who is now the one travelling incognito - rebukes him, reminding him of the dangers of not holding one's tongue in a public conveyance. Georges recognizes him and renews his acquaintance.\nIn 1838 Oscar becomes engaged to Georgette Pierrotin, daughter of the same Pierrotin who now owns the business that runs the stage-coaches between Paris and Val-d'Oise. At the close of the novel, Balzac draws the following moral:\nThe adventure of the journey to Presles was a lesson to Oscar Husson in discretion; his disaster at Florentine's card-party strengthened him in honesty and uprightness; the hardships of his military career taught him to understand the social hierarchy and to yield obedience to his lot. Becoming wise and capable, he was happy. The Comte de S\u00e9rizy, before his death, obtained for him the collectorship at Pontoise. The influence of Monsieur Moreau de l'Oise and that of the Comtesse de S\u00e9rizy and the Baron de Canalis secured, in after years, a receiver-generalship for Monsieur Husson, in whom the Camusot family now recognize a relation.\n\nOscar is a commonplace man, gentle, without assumption, modest, and always keeping, like his government, to a middle course. He excites neither envy nor contempt. In short, he is the modern bourgeois.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of A Start in Life, by Honore de Balzac\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

THAT WHICH WAS LACKING TO PIERROTIN'S HAPPINESS\n\n\nRailroads, in a future not far distant, must force certain industries\nto disappear forever, and modify several others, more especially those\nrelating to the different modes of transportation in use around Paris.\nTherefore the persons and things which are the elements of this Scene\nwill soon give to it the character of an archaeological work. Our\nnephews ought to be enchanted to learn the social material of an epoch\nwhich they will call the \"olden time.\" The picturesque \"coucous\"\nwhich stood on the Place de la Concorde, encumbering the\nCours-la-Reine,--coucous which had flourished for a century, and were\nstill numerous in 1830, scarcely exist in 1842, unless on the occasion\nof some attractive suburban solemnity, like that of the Grandes Eaux of\nVersailles. In 1820, the various celebrated places called the \"Environs\nof Paris\" did not all possess a regular stage-coach service.\n\nNevertheless, the Touchards, father and son, had acquired a monopoly of\ntravel and transportation to all the populous towns within a radius of\nforty-five miles; and their enterprise constituted a fine establishment\nin the rue du Faubourg-Saint-Denis. In spite of their long-standing\nrights, in spite, too, of their efforts, their capital, and all\nthe advantages of a powerful centralization, the Touchard coaches\n(\"messageries\") found terrible competition in the coucous for all points\nwith a circumference of fifteen or twenty miles. The passion of\nthe Parisian for the country is such that local enterprise could\nsuccessfully compete with the Lesser Stage company,--Petites\nMessageries, the name given to the Touchard enterprise to distinguish it\nfrom that of the Grandes Messageries of the rue Montmartre. At the time\nof which we write, the Touchard success was stimulating speculators.\nFor every small locality in the neighborhood of Paris there sprang up\nschemes of beautiful, rapid, and commodious vehicles, departing and\narriving in Paris at fixed hours, which produced, naturally, a fierce\ncompetition. Beaten on the long distances of twelve to eighteen miles,\nthe coucou came down to shorter trips, and so lived on for several\nyears. At last, however, it succumbed to omnibuses, which demonstrated\nthe possibility of carrying eighteen persons in a vehicle drawn by two\nhorses. To-day the coucous--if by chance any of those birds of ponderous\nflight still linger in the second-hand carriage-shops--might be made,\nas to its structure and arrangement, the subject of learned researches\ncomparable to those of Cuvier on the animals discovered in the chalk\npits of Montmartre.\n\nThese petty enterprises, which had struggled since 1822 against the\nTouchards, usually found a strong foothold in the good-will and sympathy\nof the inhabitants of the districts which they served. The person\nundertaking the business as proprietor and conductor was nearly always\nan inn-keeper along the route, to whom the beings, things, and interests\nwith which he had to do were all familiar. He could execute commissions\nintelligently; he never asked as much for his little stages, and\ntherefore obtained more custom than the Touchard coaches. He managed\nto elude the necessity of a custom-house permit. If need were, he was\nwilling to infringe the law as to the number of passengers he might\ncarry. In short, he possessed the affection of the masses; and thus it\nhappened that whenever a rival came upon the same route, if his days for\nrunning were not the same as those of the coucou, travellers would put\noff their journey to make it with their long-tried coachman, although\nhis vehicle and his horses might be in a far from reassuring condition.\n\nOne of the lines which the Touchards, father and son, endeavored to\nmonopolize, and the one most stoutly disputed (as indeed it still is),\nis that of Paris to Beaumont-sur-Oise,--a line extremely profitable, for\nthree rival enterprises worked it in 1822. In vain the Touchards\nlowered their price; in vain they constructed better coaches and started\noftener. Competition still continued, so productive is a line on which\nare little towns like Saint-Denis and Saint-Brice, and villages\nlike Pierrefitte, Groslay, Ecouen, Poncelles, Moisselles, Monsoult,\nMaffliers, Franconville, Presles, Nointel, Nerville, etc. The Touchard\ncoaches finally extended their route to Chambly; but competition\nfollowed. To-day the Toulouse, a rival enterprise, goes as far as\nBeauvais.\n\nAlong this route, which is that toward England, there lies a road which\nturns off at a place well-named, in view of its topography, The Cave,\nand leads through a most delightful valley in the basin of the Oise to\nthe little town of Isle-Adam, doubly celebrated as the cradle of the\nfamily, now extinct, of Isle-Adam, and also as the former residence\nof the Bourbon-Contis. Isle-Adam is a little town flanked by two large\nvillages, Nogent and Parmain, both remarkable for splendid quarries,\nwhich have furnished material for many of the finest buildings in modern\nParis and in foreign lands,--for the base and capital of the columns\nof the Brussels theatre are of Nogent stone. Though remarkable for\nits beautiful sites, for the famous chateaux which princes, monks, and\ndesigners have built, such as Cassan, Stors, Le Val, Nointel, Persan,\netc., this region had escaped competition in 1822, and was reached by\ntwo coaches only, working more or less in harmony.\n\nThis exception to the rule of rivalry was founded on reasons that are\neasy to understand. From the Cave, the point on the route to England\nwhere a paved road (due to the luxury of the Princes of Conti) turned\noff to Isle-Adam, the distance is six miles. No speculating enterprise\nwould make such a detour, for Isle-Adam was the terminus of the road,\nwhich did not go beyond it. Of late years, another road has been made\nbetween the valley of Montmorency and the valley of the Oise; but in\n1822 the only road which led to Isle-Adam was the paved highway of the\nPrinces of Conti. Pierrotin and his colleague reigned, therefore, from\nParis to Isle-Adam, beloved by every one along the way. Pierrotin's\nvehicle, together with that of his comrade, and Pierrotin himself, were\nso well known that even the inhabitants on the main road as far as the\nCave were in the habit of using them; for there was always better chance\nof a seat to be had than in the Beaumont coaches, which were almost\nalways full. Pierrotin and his competitor were on the best of terms.\nWhen the former started from Isle-Adam, the latter was returning from\nParis, and vice versa.\n\nIt is unnecessary to speak of the rival. Pierrotin possessed the\nsympathies of his region; besides, he is the only one of the two who\nappears in this veracious narrative. Let it suffice you to know that the\ntwo coach proprietors lived under a good understanding, rivalled each\nother loyally, and obtained customers by honorable proceedings. In Paris\nthey used, for economy's sake, the same yard, hotel, and stable, the\nsame coach-house, office, and clerk. This detail is alone sufficient to\nshow that Pierrotin and his competitor were, as the popular saying is,\n\"good dough.\" The hotel at which they put up in Paris, at the corner of\nthe rue d'Enghien, is still there, and is called the \"Lion d'Argent.\"\nThe proprietor of the establishment, which from time immemorial had\nlodged coachmen and coaches, drove himself for the great company of\nDaumartin, which was so firmly established that its neighbors, the\nTouchards, whose place of business was directly opposite, never dreamed\nof starting a rival coach on the Daumartin line.\n\nThough the departures for Isle-Adam professed to take place at a fixed\nhour, Pierrotin and his co-rival practised an indulgence in that respect\nwhich won for them the grateful affection of the country-people, and\nalso violent remonstrances on the part of strangers accustomed to\nthe regularity of the great lines of public conveyances. But the two\nconductors of these vehicles, which were half diligence, half coucou,\nwere invariably defended by their regular customers. The afternoon\ndeparture at four o'clock usually lagged on till half-past, while that\nof the morning, fixed for eight o'clock, was seldom known to take\nplace before nine. In this respect, however, the system was elastic.\nIn summer, that golden period for the coaching business, the rule of\ndeparture, rigorous toward strangers, was often relaxed for country\ncustomers. This method not infrequently enabled Pierrotin to pocket\ntwo fares for one place, if a countryman came early and wanted a seat\nalready booked and paid for by some \"bird of passage\" who was, unluckily\nfor himself, a little late. Such elasticity will certainly not commend\nitself to purists in morality; but Pierrotin and his colleague justified\nit on the varied grounds of \"hard times,\" of their losses during the\nwinter months, of the necessity of soon getting better coaches, and of\nthe duty of keeping exactly to the rules written on the tariff, copies\nof which were, however, never shown, unless some chance traveller was\nobstinate enough to demand it.\n\nPierrotin, a man about forty years of age, was already the father of a\nfamily. Released from the cavalry on the great disbandment of 1815, the\nworthy fellow had succeeded his father, who for many years had driven a\ncoucou of capricious flight between Paris and Isle-Adam. Having married\nthe daughter of a small inn-keeper, he enlarged his business, made it\na regular service, and became noted for his intelligence and a certain\nmilitary precision. Active and decided in his ways, Pierrotin (the name\nseems to have been a sobriquet) contrived to give, by the vivacity\nof his countenance, an expression of sly shrewdness to his ruddy and\nweather-stained visage which suggested wit. He was not without that\nfacility of speech which is acquired chiefly through \"seeing life\"\nand other countries. His voice, by dint of talking to his horses and\nshouting \"Gare!\" was rough; but he managed to tone it down with the\nbourgeois. His clothing, like that of all coachmen of the second class,\nconsisted of stout boots, heavy with nails, made at Isle-Adam, trousers\nof bottle-green velveteen, waistcoat of the same, over which he wore,\nwhile exercising his functions, a blue blouse, ornamented on the collar,\nshoulder-straps and cuffs, with many-colored embroidery. A cap with\na visor covered his head. His military career had left in Pierrotin's\nmanners and customs a great respect for all social superiority, and a\nhabit of obedience to persons of the upper classes; and though he never\nwillingly mingled with the lesser bourgeoisie, he always respected women\nin whatever station of life they belonged. Nevertheless, by dint of\n\"trundling the world,\"--one of his own expressions,--he had come to look\nupon those he conveyed as so many walking parcels, who required less\ncare than the inanimate ones,--the essential object of a coaching\nbusiness.\n\nWarned by the general movement which, since the Peace, was\nrevolutionizing his calling, Pierrotin would not allow himself to be\noutdone by the progress of new lights. Since the beginning of the summer\nseason he had talked much of a certain large coach, ordered from Farry,\nBreilmann, and Company, the best makers of diligences,--a purchase\nnecessitated by an increasing influx of travellers. Pierrotin's present\nestablishment consisted of two vehicles. One, which served in winter,\nand the only one he reported to the tax-gatherer, was the coucou which\nhe inherited from his father. The rounded flanks of this vehicle allowed\nhim to put six travellers on two seats, of metallic hardness in spite of\nthe yellow Utrecht velvet with which they were covered. These seats were\nseparated by a wooden bar inserted in the sides of the carriage at the\nheight of the travellers' shoulders, which could be placed or removed\nat will. This bar, specially covered with velvet (Pierrotin called it\n\"a back\"), was the despair of the passengers, from the great difficulty\nthey found in placing and removing it. If the \"back\" was difficult and\neven painful to handle, that was nothing to the suffering caused to the\nomoplates when the bar was in place. But when it was left to lie loose\nacross the coach, it made both ingress and egress extremely perilous,\nespecially to women.\n\nThough each seat of this vehicle, with rounded sides like those of a\npregnant woman, could rightfully carry only three passengers, it was\nnot uncommon to see eight persons on the two seats jammed together like\nherrings in a barrel. Pierrotin declared that the travellers were far\nmore comfortable in a solid, immovable mass; whereas when only three\nwere on a seat they banged each other perpetually, and ran much risk\nof injuring their hats against the roof by the violent jolting of the\nroads. In front of the vehicle was a wooden bench where Pierrotin\nsat, on which three travellers could perch; when there, they went, as\neverybody knows, by the name of \"rabbits.\" On certain trips Pierrotin\nplaced four rabbits on the bench, and sat himself at the side, on a\nsort of box placed below the body of the coach as a foot-rest for the\nrabbits, which was always full of straw, or of packages that feared\nno damage. The body of this particular coucou was painted yellow,\nembellished along the top with a band of barber's blue, on which could\nbe read, on the sides, in silvery white letters, \"Isle-Adam, Paris,\" and\nacross the back, \"Line to Isle-Adam.\"\n\nOur descendants will be mightily mistaken if they fancy that thirteen\npersons including Pierrotin were all that this vehicle could carry. On\ngreat occasions it could take three more in a square compartment covered\nwith an awning, where the trunks, cases, and packages were piled; but\nthe prudent Pierrotin only allowed his regular customers to sit there,\nand even they were not allowed to get in until at some distance beyond\nthe \"barriere.\" The occupants of the \"hen-roost\" (the name given by\nconductors to this section of their vehicles) were made to get down\noutside of every village or town where there was a post of gendarmerie;\nthe overloading forbidden by law, \"for the safety of passengers,\"\nbeing too obvious to allow the gendarme on duty--always a friend to\nPierrotin--to avoid the necessity of reporting this flagrant violation\nof the ordinances. Thus on certain Saturday nights and Monday mornings,\nPierrotin's coucou \"trundled\" fifteen travellers; but on such occasions,\nin order to drag it along, he gave his stout old horse, called Rougeot,\na mate in the person of a little beast no bigger than a pony, about\nwhose merits he had much to say. This little horse was a mare named\nBichette; she ate little, she was spirited, she was indefatigable, she\nwas worth her weight in gold.\n\n\"My wife wouldn't give her for that fat lazybones of a Rougeot!\" cried\nPierrotin, when some traveller would joke him about his epitome of a\nhorse.\n\nThe difference between this vehicle and the other consisted chiefly\nin the fact that the other was on four wheels. This coach, of comical\nconstruction, called the \"four-wheel-coach,\" held seventeen travellers,\nthough it was bound not to carry more than fourteen. It rumbled so\nnoisily that the inhabitants of Isle-Adam frequently said, \"Here comes\nPierrotin!\" when he was scarcely out of the forest which crowns the\nslope of the valley. It was divided into two lobes, so to speak: one,\ncalled the \"interior,\" contained six passengers on two seats; the other,\na sort of cabriolet constructed in front, was called the \"coupe.\" This\ncoupe was closed in with very inconvenient and fantastic glass sashes,\na description of which would take too much space to allow of its\nbeing given here. The four-wheeled coach was surmounted by a hooded\n\"imperial,\" into which Pierrotin managed to poke six passengers; this\nspace was inclosed by leather curtains. Pierrotin himself sat on an\nalmost invisible seat perched just below the sashes of the coupe.\n\nThe master of the establishment paid the tax which was levied upon all\npublic conveyances on his coucou only, which was rated to carry six\npersons; and he took out a special permit each time that he drove the\nfour-wheeler. This may seem extraordinary in these days, but when the\ntax on vehicles was first imposed, it was done very timidly, and such\ndeceptions were easily practised by the coach proprietors, always\npleased to \"faire la queue\" (cheat of their dues) the government\nofficials, to use the argot of their vocabulary. Gradually the greedy\nTreasury became severe; it forced all public conveyances not to roll\nunless they carried two certificates,--one showing that they had been\nweighed, the other that their taxes were duly paid. All things have\ntheir salad days, even the Treasury; and in 1822 those days still\nlasted. Often in summer, the \"four-wheel-coach,\" and the coucou\njourneyed together, carrying between them thirty-two passengers, though\nPierrotin was only paying a tax on six. On these specially lucky days\nthe convoy started from the faubourg Saint-Denis at half-past four\no'clock in the afternoon, and arrived gallantly at Isle-Adam by ten at\nnight. Proud of this service, which necessitated the hire of an extra\nhorse, Pierrotin was wont to say:--\n\n\"We went at a fine pace!\"\n\nBut in order to do the twenty-seven miles in five hours with his\ncaravan, he was forced to omit certain stoppages along the road,--at\nSaint-Brice, Moisselles, and La Cave.\n\nThe hotel du Lion d'Argent occupies a piece of land which is very deep\nfor its width. Though its frontage has only three or four windows on\nthe faubourg Saint-Denis, the building extends back through a long\ncourt-yard, at the end of which are the stables, forming a large house\nstanding close against the division wall of the adjoining property.\nThe entrance is through a sort of passage-way beneath the floor of the\nsecond story, in which two or three coaches had room to stand. In 1822\nthe offices of all the lines of coaches which started from the Lion\nd'Argent were kept by the wife of the inn-keeper, who had as many books\nas there were lines. She received the fares, booked the passengers, and\nstowed away, good-naturedly, in her vast kitchen the various packages\nand parcels to be transported. Travellers were satisfied with this\neasy-going, patriarchal system. If they arrived too soon, they seated\nthemselves beneath the hood of the huge kitchen chimney, or stood within\nthe passage-way, or crossed to the Cafe de l'Echiquier, which forms the\ncorner of the street so named.\n\nIn the early days of the autumn of 1822, on a Saturday morning,\nPierrotin was standing, with his hands thrust into his pockets through\nthe apertures of his blouse, beneath the porte-cochere of the Lion\nd'Argent, whence he could see, diagonally, the kitchen of the inn, and\nthrough the long court-yard to the stables, which were defined in black\nat the end of it. Daumartin's diligence had just started, plunging\nheavily after those of the Touchards. It was past eight o'clock. Under\nthe enormous porch or passage, above which could be read on a long\nsign, \"Hotel du Lion d'Argent,\" stood the stablemen and porters of the\ncoaching-lines watching the lively start of the vehicles which deceives\nso many travellers, making them believe that the horses will be kept to\nthat vigorous gait.\n\n\"Shall I harness up, master?\" asked Pierrotin's hostler, when there was\nnothing more to be seen along the road.\n\n\"It is a quarter-past eight, and I don't see any travellers,\" replied\nPierrotin. \"Where have they poked themselves? Yes, harness up all the\nsame. And there are no parcels either! Twenty good Gods! a fine day\nlike this, and I've only four booked! A pretty state of things for a\nSaturday! It is always the same when you want money! A dog's life, and a\ndog's business!\"\n\n\"If you had more, where would you put them? There's nothing left but the\ncabriolet,\" said the hostler, intending to soothe Pierrotin.\n\n\"You forget the new coach!\" cried Pierrotin.\n\n\"Have you really got it?\" asked the man, laughing, and showing a set of\nteeth as white and broad as almonds.\n\n\"You old good-for-nothing! It starts to-morrow, I tell you; and I want\nat least eighteen passengers for it.\"\n\n\"Ha, ha! a fine affair; it'll warm up the road,\" said the hostler.\n\n\"A coach like that which runs to Beaumont, hey? Flaming! painted red\nand gold to make Touchard burst with envy! It takes three horses! I have\nbought a mate for Rougeot, and Bichette will go finely in unicorn.\nCome, harness up!\" added Pierrotin, glancing out towards the street,\nand stuffing the tobacco into his clay pipe. \"I see a lady and lad\nover there with packages under their arms; they are coming to the Lion\nd'Argent, for they've turned a deaf ear to the coucous. Tiens, tiens!\nseems to me I know that lady for an old customer.\"\n\n\"You've often started empty, and arrived full,\" said his porter, still\nby way of consolation.\n\n\"But no parcels! Twenty good Gods! What a fate!\"\n\nAnd Pierrotin sat down on one of the huge stone posts which protected\nthe walls of the building from the wheels of the coaches; but he did so\nwith an anxious, reflective air that was not habitual with him.\n\nThis conversation, apparently insignificant, had stirred up cruel\nanxieties which were slumbering in his breast. What could there be to\ntrouble the heart of Pierrotin in a fine new coach? To shine upon\n\"the road,\" to rival the Touchards, to magnify his own line, to carry\npassengers who would compliment him on the conveniences due to the\nprogress of coach-building, instead of having to listen to perpetual\ncomplaints of his \"sabots\" (tires of enormous width),--such was\nPierrotin's laudable ambition; but, carried away with the desire to\noutstrip his comrade on the line, hoping that the latter might some day\nretire and leave to him alone the transportation to Isle-Adam, he had\ngone too far. The coach was indeed ordered from Barry, Breilmann, and\nCompany, coach-builders, who had just substituted square English\nsprings for those called \"swan-necks,\" and other old-fashioned French\ncontrivances. But these hard and distrustful manufacturers would only\ndeliver over the diligence in return for coin. Not particularly pleased\nto build a vehicle which would be difficult to sell if it remained upon\ntheir hands, these long-headed dealers declined to undertake it at all\nuntil Pierrotin had made a preliminary payment of two thousand francs.\nTo satisfy this precautionary demand, Pierrotin had exhausted all his\nresources and all his credit. His wife, his father-in-law, and his\nfriends had bled. This superb diligence he had been to see the evening\nbefore at the painter's; all it needed now was to be set a-rolling, but\nto make it roll, payment in full must, alas! be made.\n\nNow, a thousand francs were lacking to Pierrotin, and where to get them\nhe did not know. He was in debt to the master of the Lion d'Argent; he\nwas in danger of his losing his two thousand francs already paid to the\ncoach-builder, not counting five hundred for the mate to Rougeot, and\nthree hundred for new harnesses, on which he had a three-months' credit.\nDriven by the fury of despair and the madness of vanity, he had just\nopenly declared that the new coach was to start on the morrow. By\noffering fifteen hundred francs, instead of the two thousand five\nhundred still due, he was in hopes that the softened carriage-builders\nwould give him his coach. But after a few moments' meditation, his\nfeelings led him to cry out aloud:--\n\n\"No! they're dogs! harpies! Suppose I appeal to Monsieur Moreau, the\nsteward at Presles? he is such a kind man,\" thought Pierrotin, struck\nwith a new idea. \"Perhaps he would take my note for six months.\"\n\nAt this moment a footman in livery, carrying a leather portmanteau and\ncoming from the Touchard establishment, where he had gone too late to\nsecure places as far as Chambly, came up and said:--\n\n\"Are you Pierrotin?\"\n\n\"Say on,\" replied Pierrotin.\n\n\"If you would wait a quarter of an hour, you could take my master.\nIf not, I'll carry back the portmanteau and try to find some other\nconveyance.\"\n\n\"I'll wait two, three quarters, and throw a little in besides, my lad,\"\nsaid Pierrotin, eyeing the pretty leather trunk, well buckled, and\nbearing a brass plate with a coat of arms.\n\n\"Very good; then take this,\" said the valet, ridding his shoulder of the\ntrunk, which Pierrotin lifted, weighed, and examined.\n\n\"Here,\" he said to his porter, \"wrap it up carefully in soft hay and put\nit in the boot. There's no name upon it,\" he added.\n\n\"Monseigneur's arms are there,\" replied the valet.\n\n\"Monseigneur! Come and take a glass,\" said Pierrotin, nodding toward\nthe Cafe de l'Echiquier, whither he conducted the valet. \"Waiter, two\nabsinthes!\" he said, as he entered. \"Who is your master? and where is\nhe going? I have never seen you before,\" said Pierrotin to the valet as\nthey touched glasses.\n\n\"There's a good reason for that,\" said the footman. \"My master only\ngoes into your parts about once a year, and then in his own carriage. He\nprefers the valley d'Orge, where he has the most beautiful park in the\nneighborhood of Paris, a perfect Versailles, a family estate of which he\nbears the name. Don't you know Monsieur Moreau?\"\n\n\"The steward of Presles?\"\n\n\"Yes. Monsieur le Comte is going down to spend a couple of days with\nhim.\"\n\n\"Ha! then I'm to carry Monsieur le Comte de Serizy!\" cried the\ncoach-proprietor.\n\n\"Yes, my land, neither more nor less. But listen! here's a special\norder. If you have any of the country neighbors in your coach you are\nnot to call him Monsieur le comte; he wants to travel 'en cognito,' and\ntold me to be sure to say he would pay a handsome pourboire if he was\nnot recognized.\"\n\n\"So! Has this secret journey anything to do with the affair which Pere\nLeger, the farmer at the Moulineaux, came to Paris the other day to\nsettle?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied the valet, \"but the fat's in the fire. Last\nnight I was sent to the stable to order the Daumont carriage to be ready\nto go to Presles at seven this morning. But when seven o'clock came,\nMonsieur le comte countermanded it. Augustin, his valet de chambre,\nattributes the change to the visit of a lady who called last night, and\nagain this morning,--he thought she came from the country.\"\n\n\"Could she have told him anything against Monsieur Moreau?--the best of\nmen, the most honest of men, a king of men, hey! He might have made a\ndeal more than he has out of his position, if he'd chosen; I can tell\nyou that.\"\n\n\"Then he was foolish,\" answered the valet, sententiously.\n\n\"Is Monsieur le Serizy going to live at Presles at last?\" asked\nPierrotin; \"for you know they have just repaired and refurnished the\nchateau. Do you think it is true he has already spent two hundred\nthousand francs upon it?\"\n\n\"If you or I had half what he has spent upon it, you and I would be rich\nbourgeois. If Madame la comtesse goes there--ha! I tell you what! no\nmore ease and comfort for the Moreaus,\" said the valet, with an air of\nmystery.\n\n\"He's a worthy man, Monsieur Moreau,\" remarked Pierrotin, thinking of\nthe thousand francs he wanted to get from the steward. \"He is a man who\nmakes others work, but he doesn't cheapen what they do; and he gets all\nhe can out of the land--for his master. Honest man! He often comes to\nParis and gives me a good fee: he has lots of errands for me to do in\nParis; sometimes three or four packages a day,--either from monsieur or\nmadame. My bill for cartage alone comes to fifty francs a month, more or\nless. If madame does set up to be somebody, she's fond of her children;\nand it is I who fetch them from school and take them back; and each time\nshe gives me five francs,--a real great lady couldn't do better than\nthat. And every time I have any one in the coach belonging to them or\ngoing to see them, I'm allowed to drive up to the chateau,--that's all\nright, isn't it?\"\n\n\"They say Monsieur Moreau wasn't worth three thousand francs when\nMonsieur le comte made him steward of Presles,\" said the valet.\n\n\"Well, since 1806, there's seventeen years, and the man ought to have\nmade something at any rate.\"\n\n\"True,\" said the valet, nodding. \"Anyway, masters are very annoying; and\nI hope, for Moreau's sake, that he has made butter for his bread.\"\n\n\"I have often been to your house in the rue de la Chaussee d'Antin\nto carry baskets of game,\" said Pierrotin, \"but I've never had the\nadvantage, so far of seeing either monsieur or madame.\"\n\n\"Monsieur le comte is a good man,\" said the footman, confidentially.\n\"But if he insists on your helping to keep up his cognito there's\nsomething in the wind. At any rate, so we think at the house; or else,\nwhy should he countermand the Daumont,--why travel in a coucou? A peer\nof France might afford to hire a cabriolet to himself, one would think.\"\n\n\"A cabriolet would cost him forty francs to go there and back; for\nlet me tell you, if you don't know it, that road was only made for\nsquirrels,--up-hill and down, down-hill and up!\" said Pierrotin. \"Peer\nof France or bourgeois, they are all looking after the main chance, and\nsaving their money. If this journey concerns Monsieur Moreau, faith, I'd\nbe sorry any harm should come to him! Twenty good Gods! hadn't I better\nfind some way of warning him?--for he's a truly good man, a kind man, a\nking of men, hey!\"\n\n\"Pooh! Monsieur le comte thinks everything of Monsieur Moreau,\" replied\nthe valet. \"But let me give you a bit of good advice. Every man for\nhimself in this world. We have enough to do to take care of ourselves.\nDo what Monsieur le comte asks you to do, and all the more because\nthere's no trifling with him. Besides, to tell the truth, the count is\ngenerous. If you oblige him so far,\" said the valet, pointing half-way\ndown his little finger, \"he'll send you on as far as that,\" stretching\nout his arm to its full length.\n\nThis wise reflection, and the action that enforced it, had the effect,\ncoming from a man who stood as high as second valet to the Comte de\nSerizy, of cooling the ardor of Pierrotin for the steward of Presles.\n\n\"Well, adieu, Monsieur Pierrotin,\" said the valet.\n\nA glance rapidly cast on the life of the Comte de Serizy, and on that of\nhis steward, is here necessary in order to fully understand the little\ndrama now about to take place in Pierrotin's vehicle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. THE STEWARD IN DANGER\n\n\nMonsieur Huguet de Serisy descends in a direct line from the famous\npresident Huguet, ennobled under Francois I.\n\nThis family bears: party per pale or and sable, an orle counterchanged\nand two lozenges counterchanged, with: \"i, semper melius eris,\"--a motto\nwhich, together with the two distaffs taken as supporters, proves the\nmodesty of the burgher families in the days when the Orders held their\nallotted places in the State; and the naivete of our ancient customs by\nthe pun on \"eris,\" which word, combined with the \"i\" at the beginning\nand the final \"s\" in \"melius,\" forms the name (Serisy) of the estate\nfrom which the family take their title.\n\nThe father of the present count was president of a parliament before\nthe Revolution. He himself a councillor of State at the Grand Council\nof 1787, when he was only twenty-two years of age, was even then\ndistinguished for his admirable memoranda on delicate diplomatic\nmatters. He did not emigrate during the Revolution, and spent that\nperiod on his estate of Serizy near Arpajon, where the respect in\nwhich his father was held protected him from all danger. After spending\nseveral years in taking care of the old president, who died in 1794,\nhe was elected about that time to the Council of the Five Hundred, and\naccepted those legislative functions to divert his mind from his grief.\nAfter the 18th Brumaire, Monsieur de Serizy became, like so many other\nof the old parliamentary families, an object of the First Consul's\nblandishment. He was appointed to the Council of State, and received one\nof the most disorganized departments of the government to reconstruct.\nThis scion of an old historical family proved to be a very active wheel\nin the grand and magnificent organization which we owe to Napoleon.\n\nThe councillor of State was soon called from his particular\nadministration to a ministry. Created count and senator by the Emperor,\nhe was made proconsul to two kingdoms in succession. In 1806, when\nforty years of age, he married the sister of the ci-devant Marquis\nde Ronquerolles, the widow at twenty of Gaubert, one of the most\nillustrious of the Republican generals, who left her his whole property.\nThis marriage, a suitable one in point of rank, doubled the already\nconsiderable fortune of the Comte de Serizy, who became through his wife\nthe brother-in-law of the ci-devant Marquis de Rouvre, made count and\nchamberlain by the Emperor.\n\nIn 1814, weary with constant toil, the Comte de Serizy, whose shattered\nhealth required rest, resigned all his posts, left the department at\nthe head of which the Emperor had placed him, and came to Paris, where\nNapoleon was compelled by the evidence of his eyes to admit that the\ncount's illness was a valid excuse, though at first that _unfatiguable_\nmaster, who gave no heed to the fatigue of others, was disposed to\nconsider Monsieur de Serizy's action as a defection. Though the senator\nwas never in disgrace, he was supposed to have reason to complain of\nNapoleon. Consequently, when the Bourbons returned, Louis XVIII., whom\nMonsieur de Serizy held to be his legitimate sovereign, treated the\nsenator, now a peer of France, with the utmost confidence, placed him\nin charge of his private affairs, and appointed him one of his cabinet\nministers. On the 20th of March, Monsieur de Serizy did not go to Ghent.\nHe informed Napoleon that he remained faithful to the house of Bourbon;\nwould not accept his peerage during the Hundred Days, and passed that\nperiod on his estate at Serizy.\n\nAfter the second fall of the Emperor, he became once more a\nprivy-councillor, was appointed vice-president of the Council of State,\nand liquidator, on behalf of France, of claims and indemnities demanded\nby foreign powers. Without personal assumption, without ambition even,\nhe possessed great influence in public affairs. Nothing of importance\nwas done without consulting him; but he never went to court, and was\nseldom seen in his own salons. This noble life, devoting itself from its\nvery beginning to work, had ended by becoming a life of incessant toil.\nThe count rose at all seasons by four o'clock in the morning, and\nworked till mid-day, attended to his functions as peer of France and\nvice-president of the Council of State in the afternoons, and went to\nbed at nine o'clock. In recognition of such labor, the King had made\nhim a knight of his various Orders. Monsieur de Serizy had long worn the\ngrand cross of the Legion of honor; he also had the orders of the Golden\nFleece, of Saint-Andrew of Russia, that of the Prussian Eagle, and\nnearly all the lesser Orders of the courts of Europe. No man was less\nobvious, or more useful in the political world than he. It is easy\nto understand that the world's honor, the fuss and feathers of public\nfavor, the glories of success were indifferent to a man of this stamp;\nbut no one, unless a priest, ever comes to life of this kind without\nsome serious underlying reason. His conduct had its cause, and a cruel\none.\n\nIn love with his wife before he married her, this passion had lasted\nthrough all the secret unhappiness of his marriage with a widow,--a\nwoman mistress of herself before as well as after her second marriage,\nand who used her liberty all the more freely because her husband treated\nher with the indulgence of a mother for a spoilt child. His constant\ntoil served him as shield and buckler against pangs of heart which he\nsilenced with the care that diplomatists give to the keeping of secrets.\nHe knew, moreover, how ridiculous was jealousy in the eyes of a society\nthat would never have believed in the conjugal passion of an old\nstatesman. How happened it that from the earliest days of his marriage\nhis wife so fascinated him? Why did he suffer without resistance? How\nwas it that he dared not resist? Why did he let the years go by and\nstill hope on? By what means did this young and pretty and clever woman\nhold him in bondage?\n\nThe answer to all these questions would require a long history, which\nwould injure our present tale. Let us only remark here that the constant\ntoil and grief of the count had unfortunately contributed not a little\nto deprive him of personal advantages very necessary to a man who\nattempts to struggle against dangerous comparisons. In fact, the most\ncruel of the count's secret sorrows was that of causing repugnance to\nhis wife by a malady of the skin resulting solely from excessive labor.\nKind, and always considerate of the countess, he allowed her to be\nmistress of herself and her home. She received all Paris; she went into\nthe country; she returned from it precisely as though she were still a\nwidow. He took care of her fortune and supplied her luxury as a steward\nmight have done. The countess had the utmost respect for her husband.\nShe even admired his turn of mind; she knew how to make him happy by\napprobation; she could do what she pleased with him by simply going to\nhis study and talking for an hour with him. Like the great seigneurs of\nthe olden time, the count protected his wife so loyally that a single\nword of disrespect said of her would have been to him an unpardonable\ninjury. The world admired him for this; and Madame de Serizy owed\nmuch to it. Any other woman, even though she came of a family as\ndistinguished as the Ronquerolles, might have found herself degraded\nin public opinion. The countess was ungrateful, but she mingled a charm\nwith her ingratitude. From time to time she shed a balm upon the wounds\nof her husband's heart.\n\nLet us now explain the meaning of this sudden journey, and the incognito\nmaintained by a minister of State.\n\nA rich farmer of Beaumont-sur-Oise, named Leger, leased and cultivated\na farm, the fields of which projected into and greatly injured the\nmagnificent estate of the Comte de Serizy, called Presles. This farm\nbelonged to a burgher of Beaumont-sur-Oise, named Margueron. The lease\nmade to Leger in 1799, at a time when the great advance of agriculture\nwas not foreseen, was about to expire, and the owner of the farm refused\nall offers from Leger to renew the lease. For some time past, Monsieur\nde Serizy, wishing to rid himself of the annoyances and petty disputes\ncaused by the inclosure of these fields within his land, had desired to\nbuy the farm, having heard that Monsieur Margueron's chief ambition was\nto have his only son, then a mere tax-gatherer, made special collector\nof finances at Beaumont. The farmer, who knew he could sell the fields\npiecemeal to the count at a high price, was ready to pay Margueron even\nmore than he expected from the count.\n\nThus matters stood when, two days earlier than that of which we write,\nMonsieur de Serizy, anxious to end the matter, sent for his notary,\nAlexandre Crottat, and his lawyer, Derville, to examine into all the\ncircumstances of the affair. Though Derville and Crottat threw some\ndoubt on the zeal of the count's steward (a disturbing letter from whom\nhad led to the consultation), Monsieur de Serizy defended Moreau, who,\nhe said, had served him faithfully for seventeen years.\n\n\"Very well!\" said Derville, \"then I advise your Excellency to go to\nPresles yourself, and invite this Margueron to dinner. Crottat will send\nhis head-clerk with a deed of sale drawn up, leaving only the necessary\nlines for description of property and titles in blank. Your Excellency\nshould take with you part of the purchase money in a check on the\nBank of France, not forgetting the appointment of the son to the\ncollectorship. If you don't settle the thing at once that farm will slip\nthrough your fingers. You don't know, Monsieur le comte, the trickery of\nthese peasants. Peasants against diplomat, and the diplomat succumbs.\"\n\nCrottat agreed in this advice, which the count, if we may judge by the\nvalet's statements to Pierrotin, had adopted. The preceding evening\nhe had sent Moreau a line by the diligence to Beaumont, telling him to\ninvite Margueron to dinner in order that they might then and there close\nthe purchase of the farm of Moulineaux.\n\nBefore this matter came up, the count had already ordered the chateau of\nPresles to be restored and refurnished, and for the last year, Grindot,\nan architect then in fashion, was in the habit of making a weekly visit.\nSo, while concluding his purchase of the farm, Monsieur de Serizy also\nintended to examine the work of restoration and the effect of the new\nfurniture. He intended all this to be a surprise to his wife when he\nbrought her to Presles, and with this idea in his mind, he had put some\npersonal pride and self-love into the work. How came it therefore that\nthe count, who intended in the evening to drive to Presles openly in\nhis own carriage, should be starting early the next morning incognito in\nPierrotin's coucou?\n\nHere a few words on the life of the steward Moreau become indispensable.\n\nMoreau, steward of the state of Presles, was the son of a provincial\nattorney who became during the Revolution syndic-attorney at Versailles.\nIn that position, Moreau the father had been the means of almost saving\nboth the lives and property of the Serizys, father and son. Citizen\nMoreau belonged to the Danton party; Robespierre, implacable in his\nhatreds, pursued him, discovered him, and finally had him executed at\nVersailles. Moreau the son, heir to the doctrines and friendships of\nhis father, was concerned in one of the conspiracies which assailed\nthe First Consul on his accession to power. At this crisis, Monsieur\nde Serizy, anxious to pay his debt of gratitude, enabled Moreau, lying\nunder sentence of death, to make his escape; in 1804 he asked for his\npardon, obtained it, offered him first a place in his government office,\nand finally took him as private secretary for his own affairs.\n\nSome time after the marriage of his patron Moreau fell in love with the\ncountess's waiting-woman and married her. To avoid the annoyances of the\nfalse position in which this marriage placed him (more than one example\nof which could be seen at the imperial court), Moreau asked the count to\ngive him the management of the Presles estate, where his wife could\nplay the lady in a country region, and neither of them would be made\nto suffer from wounded self-love. The count wanted a trustworthy man\nat Presles, for his wife preferred Serizy, an estate only fifteen miles\nfrom Paris. For three or four years Moreau had held the key of the\ncount's affairs; he was intelligent, and before the Revolution he had\nstudied law in his father's office; so Monsieur de Serizy granted his\nrequest.\n\n\"You can never advance in life,\" he said to Moreau, \"for you have broken\nyour neck; but you can be happy, and I will take care that you are so.\"\n\nHe gave Moreau a salary of three thousand francs and his residence in a\ncharming lodge near the chateau, all the wood he needed from the timber\nthat was cut on the estate, oats, hay, and straw for two horses, and a\nright to whatever he wanted of the produce of the gardens. A sub-prefect\nis not as well provided for.\n\nDuring the first eight years of his stewardship, Moreau managed the\nestate conscientiously; he took an interest in it. The count, coming\ndown now and then to examine the property, pass judgment on what had\nbeen done, and decide on new purchases, was struck with Moreau's evident\nloyalty, and showed his satisfaction by liberal gifts.\n\nBut after the birth of Moreau's third child, a daughter, he felt himself\nso securely settled in all his comforts at Presles that he ceased to\nattribute to Monsieur de Serizy those enormous advantages. About the\nyear 1816, the steward, who until then had only taken what he needed\nfor his own use from the estate, accepted a sum of twenty-five thousand\nfrancs from a wood-merchant as an inducement to lease to the latter,\nfor twelve years, the cutting of all the timber. Moreau argued this: he\ncould have no pension; he was the father of a family; the count really\nowed him that sum as a gift after ten years' management; already the\nlegitimate possessor of sixty thousand francs in savings, if he added\nthis sum to that, he could buy a farm worth a hundred and twenty-five\nthousand francs in Champagne, a township just above Isle-Adam, on the\nright bank of the Oise. Political events prevented both the count and\nthe neighboring country-people from becoming aware of this investment,\nwhich was made in the name of Madame Moreau, who was understood to have\ninherited property from an aunt of her father.\n\nAs soon as the steward had tasted the delightful fruit of the possession\nof the property, he began, all the while maintaining toward the world\nan appearance of the utmost integrity, to lose no occasion of increasing\nhis fortune clandestinely; the interests of his three children served as\na poultice to the wounds of his honor. Nevertheless, we ought in justice\nto say that while he accepted casks of wine, and took care of himself in\nall the purchases that he made for the count, yet according to the terms\nof the Code he remained an honest man, and no proof could have\nbeen found to justify an accusation against him. According to the\njurisprudence of the least thieving cook in Paris, he shared with the\ncount in the profits due to his own capable management. This manner\nof swelling his fortune was simply a case of conscience, that was\nall. Alert, and thoroughly understanding the count's interests, Moreau\nwatched for opportunities to make good purchases all the more eagerly,\nbecause he gained a larger percentage on them. Presles returned\na revenue of seventy thousand francs net. It was a saying of the\ncountry-side for a circuit of thirty miles:--\n\n\"Monsieur de Serizy has a second self in Moreau.\"\n\nBeing a prudent man, Moreau invested yearly, after 1817, both his\nprofits and his salary on the Grand Livre, piling up his heap with the\nutmost secrecy. He often refused proposals on the plea of want of money;\nand he played the poor man so successfully with the count that the\nlatter gave him the means to send both his sons to the school Henri IV.\nAt the present moment Moreau was worth one hundred and twenty thousand\nfrancs of capital invested in the Consolidated thirds, now paying\nfive per cent, and quoted at eighty francs. These carefully hidden one\nhundred and twenty thousand francs, and his farm at Champagne, enlarged\nby subsequent purchases, amounted to a fortune of about two hundred and\neighty thousand francs, giving him an income of some sixteen thousand.\n\nSuch was the position of the steward at the time when the Comte de\nSerizy desired to purchase the farm of Moulineaux,--the ownership\nof which was indispensable to his comfort. This farm consisted of\nninety-six parcels of land bordering the estate of Presles, and\nfrequently running into it, producing the most annoying discussions\nas to the trimming of hedges and ditches and the cutting of trees. Any\nother than a cabinet minister would probably have had scores of lawsuits\non his hands. Pere Leger only wished to buy the property in order\nto sell to the count at a handsome advance. In order to secure the\nexorbitant sum on which his mind was set, the farmer had long endeavored\nto come to an understanding with Moreau. Impelled by circumstances, he\nhad, only three days before this critical Sunday, had a talk with the\nsteward in the open field, and proved to him clearly that he (Moreau)\ncould make the count invest his money at two and a half per cent, and\nthus appear to serve his patron's interests, while he himself pocketed\nforty thousand francs which Leger offered him to bring about the\ntransaction.\n\n\"I tell you what,\" said the steward to his wife, as he went to bed\nthat night, \"if I make fifty thousand francs out of the Moulineaux\naffair,--and I certainly shall, for the count will give me ten thousand\nas a fee,--we'll retire to Isle-Adam and live in the Pavillon de\nNogent.\"\n\nThis \"pavillon\" was a charming place, originally built by the Prince de\nConti for a mistress, and in it every convenience and luxury had been\nplaced.\n\n\"That will suit me,\" said his wife. \"The Dutchman who lives there has\nput it in good order, and now that he is obliged to return to India, he\nwould probably let us have it for thirty thousand francs.\"\n\n\"We shall be close to Champagne,\" said Moreau. \"I am in hopes of buying\nthe farm and mill of Mours for a hundred thousand francs. That would\ngive us ten thousand a year in rentals. Nogent is one of the most\ndelightful residences in the valley; and we should still have an income\nof ten thousand from the Grand-Livre.\"\n\n\"But why don't you ask for the post of juge-de-paix at Isle-Adam? That\nwould give us influence, and fifteen hundred a year salary.\"\n\n\"Well, I did think of it.\"\n\nWith these plans in mind, Moreau, as soon as he heard from the count\nthat he was coming to Presles, and wished him to invite Margueron to\ndinner on Saturday, sent off an express to the count's head-valet,\ninclosing a letter to his master, which the messenger failed to deliver\nbefore Monsieur de Serizy retired at his usually early hour. Augustin,\nhowever, placed it, according to custom in such cases, on his master's\ndesk. In this letter Moreau begged the count not to trouble himself to\ncome down, but to trust entirely to him. He added that Margueron was no\nlonger willing to sell the whole in one block, and talked of cutting the\nfarm up into a number of smaller lots. It was necessary to circumvent\nthis plan, and perhaps, added Moreau, it might be best to employ a third\nparty to make the purchase.\n\nEverybody has enemies in this life. Now the steward and his wife had\nwounded the feelings of a retired army officer, Monsieur de Reybert, and\nhis wife, who were living near Presles. From speeches like pin-pricks,\nmatters had advanced to dagger-thrusts. Monsieur de Reybert breathed\nvengeance. He was determined to make Moreau lose his situation and\ngain it himself. The two ideas were twins. Thus the proceedings of the\nsteward, spied upon for two years, were no secret to Reybert. The same\nconveyance that took Moreau's letter to the count conveyed Madame de\nReybert, whom her husband despatched to Paris. There she asked with such\nearnestness to see the count that although she was sent away at nine\no'clock, he having then gone to bed, she was ushered into his study the\nnext morning at seven.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" she said to the cabinet-minister, \"we are incapable, my\nhusband and I, of writing anonymous letters, therefore I have come to\nsee you in person. I am Madame de Reybert, nee de Corroy. My husband is\na retired officer, with a pension of six hundred francs, and we live at\nPresles, where your steward has offered us insult after insult, although\nwe are persons of good station. Monsieur de Reybert, who is not an\nintriguing man, far from it, is a captain of artillery, retired in 1816,\nhaving served twenty years,--always at a distance from the Emperor,\nMonsieur le comte. You know of course how difficult it is for soldiers\nwho are not under the eye of their master to obtain promotion,--not\ncounting that the integrity and frankness of Monsieur de Reybert were\ndispleasing to his superiors. My husband has watched your steward for\nthe last three years, being aware of his dishonesty and intending to\nhave him lose his place. We are, as you see, quite frank with you.\nMoreau has made us his enemies, and we have watched him. I have come to\ntell you that you are being tricked in the purchase of the Moulineaux\nfarm. They mean to get an extra hundred thousand francs out of you,\nwhich are to be divided between the notary, the farmer Leger, and\nMoreau. You have written Moreau to invite Margueron, and you are going\nto Presles to-day; but Margueron will be ill, and Leger is so certain\nof buying the farm that he is now in Paris to draw the money. If we\nhave enlightened you as to what is going on, and if you want an upright\nsteward you will take my husband; though noble, he will serve you as he\nhas served the State. Your steward has made a fortune of two hundred\nand fifty thousand francs out of his place; he is not to be pitied\ntherefore.\"\n\nThe count thanked Madame de Reybert coldly, bestowing upon her the\nholy-water of courts, for he despised backbiting; but for all that, he\nremembered Derville's doubts, and felt inwardly shaken. Just then he saw\nhis steward's letter and read it. In its assurances of devotion and its\nrespectful reproaches for the distrust implied in wishing to negotiate\nthe purchase for himself, he read the truth.\n\n\"Corruption has come to him with fortune,--as it always does!\" he said\nto himself.\n\nThe count then made several inquiries of Madame de Reybert, less to\nobtain information than to gain time to observe her; and he wrote a\nshort note to his notary telling him not to send his head-clerk to\nPresles as requested, but to come there himself in time for dinner.\n\n\"Though Monsieur le comte,\" said Madame de Reybert in conclusion, \"may\nhave judged me unfavorably for the step I have taken unknown to my\nhusband, he ought to be convinced that we have obtained this information\nabout his steward in a natural and honorable manner; the most sensitive\nconscience cannot take exception to it.\"\n\nSo saying, Madame de Reybert, nee de Corroy, stood erect as a\npike-staff. She presented to the rapid investigation of the count a\nface seamed with the small-pox like a colander with holes, a flat,\nspare figure, two light and eager eyes, fair hair plastered down upon\nan anxious forehead, a small drawn-bonnet of faded green taffetas lined\nwith pink, a white gown with violet spots, and leather shoes. The\ncount recognized the wife of some poor, half-pay captain, a puritan,\nsubscribing no doubt to the \"Courrier Francais,\" earnest in virtue, but\naware of the comfort of a good situation and eagerly coveting it.\n\n\"You say your husband has a pension of six hundred francs,\" he said,\nreplying to his own thoughts, and not to the remark Madame de Reybert\nhad just made.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"You were born a Corroy?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,--a noble family of Metz, where my husband belongs.\"\n\n\"In what regiment did Monsieur de Reybert serve?\"\n\n\"The 7th artillery.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said the count, writing down the number.\n\nHe had thought at one time of giving the management of the estate to\nsome retired army officer, about whom he could obtain exact information\nfrom the minister of war.\n\n\"Madame,\" he resumed, ringing for his valet, \"return to Presles, this\nafternoon with my notary, who is going down there for dinner, and to\nwhom I have recommended you. Here is his address. I am going myself\nsecretly to Presles, and will send for Monsieur de Reybert to come and\nspeak to me.\"\n\nIt will thus be seen that Monsieur de Serizy's journey by a public\nconveyance, and the injunction conveyed by the valet to conceal his name\nand rank had not unnecessarily alarmed Pierrotin. That worthy had just\nforebodings of a danger which was about to swoop down upon one of his\nbest customers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. THE TRAVELLERS\n\n\nAs Pierrotin issued from the Cafe de l'Echiquier, after treating the\nvalet, he saw in the gate-way of the Lion d'Argent the lady and the\nyoung man in whom his perspicacity at once detected customers, for the\nlady with outstretched neck and anxious face was evidently looking for\nhim. She was dressed in a black-silk gown that was dyed, a brown bonnet,\nan old French cashmere shawl, raw-silk stockings, and low shoes; and in\nher hand she carried a straw bag and a blue umbrella. This woman, who\nhad once been beautiful, seemed to be about forty years of age; but her\nblue eyes, deprived of the fire which happiness puts there, told plainly\nthat she had long renounced the world. Her dress, as well as her whole\nair and demeanor, indicated a mother wholly devoted to her household\nand her son. If the strings of her bonnet were faded, the shape betrayed\nthat it was several years old. The shawl was fastened by a broken\nneedle converted into a pin by a bead of sealing-wax. She was waiting\nimpatiently for Pierrotin, wishing to recommend to his special care her\nson, who was doubtless travelling for the first time, and with whom she\nhad come to the coach-office as much from doubt of his ability as from\nmaternal affection.\n\nThis mother was in every way completed by the son, so that the son would\nnot be understood without the mother. If the mother condemned herself to\nmended gloves, the son wore an olive-green coat with sleeves too short\nfor him, proving that he had grown, and might grow still more, like\nother adults of eighteen or nineteen years of age. The blue trousers,\nmended by his mother, presented to the eye a brighter patch of color\nwhen the coat-tails maliciously parted behind him.\n\n\"Don't rub your gloves that way, you'll spoil them,\" she was saying as\nPierrotin appeared. \"Is this the conductor? Ah! Pierrotin, is it you?\"\nshe exclaimed, leaving her son and taking the coachman apart a few\nsteps.\n\n\"I hope you're well, Madame Clapart,\" he replied, with an air that\nexpressed both respect and familiarity.\n\n\"Yes, Pierrotin, very well. Please take good care of my Oscar; he is\ntravelling alone for the first time.\"\n\n\"Oh! so he is going alone to Monsieur Moreau!\" cried Pierrotin, for the\npurpose of finding out whether he were really going there.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the mother.\n\n\"Then Madame Moreau is willing?\" returned Pierrotin, with a sly look.\n\n\"Ah!\" said the mother, \"it will not be all roses for him, poor child!\nBut his future absolutely requires that I should send him.\"\n\nThis answer struck Pierrotin, who hesitated to confide his fears for\nthe steward to Madame Clapart, while she, on her part, was afraid of\ninjuring her boy if she asked Pierrotin for a care which might have\ntransformed him into a mentor. During this short deliberation, which was\nostensibly covered by a few phrases as to the weather, the journey, and\nthe stopping-places along the road, we will ourselves explain what were\nthe ties that united Madame Clapart with Pierrotin, and authorized the\ntwo confidential remarks which they have just exchanged.\n\nOften--that is to say, three or four times a month--Pierrotin, on his\nway to Paris, would find the steward on the road near La Cave. As soon\nas the vehicle came up, Moreau would sign to a gardener, who, with\nPierrotin's help, would put upon the coach either one or two baskets\ncontaining the fruits and vegetables of the season, chickens, eggs,\nbutter, and game. The steward always paid the carriage and Pierrotin's\nfee, adding the money necessary to pay the toll at the barriere, if\nthe baskets contained anything dutiable. These baskets, hampers, or\npackages, were never directed to any one. On the first occasion, which\nserved for all others, the steward had given Madame Clapart's address by\nword of mouth to the discreet Pierrotin, requesting him never to deliver\nto others the precious packages. Pierrotin, impressed with the idea\nof an intrigue between the steward and some pretty girl, had gone as\ndirected to number 7 rue de la Cerisaie, in the Arsenal quarter, and had\nthere found the Madame Clapart just portrayed, instead of the young and\nbeautiful creature he expected to find.\n\nThe drivers of public conveyances and carriers are called by their\nbusiness to enter many homes, and to be cognizant of many secrets; but\nsocial accident, that sub-providence, having willed that they be without\neducation and devoid of the talent of observation, it follows that they\nare not dangerous. Nevertheless, at the end of a few months, Pierrotin\nwas puzzled to explain the exact relations of Monsieur Moreau and Madame\nClapart from what he saw of the household in the rue de la Cerisaie.\nThough lodgings were not dear at that time in the Arsenal quarter,\nMadame Clapart lived on a third floor at the end of a court-yard, in a\nhouse which was formerly that of a great family, in the days when the\nhigher nobility of the kingdom lived on the ancient site of the Palais\ndes Tournelles and the hotel Saint-Paul. Toward the end of the sixteenth\ncentury, the great seigneurs divided among themselves these vast spaces,\nonce occupied by the gardens of the kings of France, as indicated by the\npresent names of the streets,--Cerisaie, Beautreillis, des Lions, etc.\nMadame Clapart's apartment, which was panelled throughout with ancient\ncarvings, consisted of three connecting rooms, a dining-room, salon, and\nbedroom. Above it was the kitchen, and a bedroom for Oscar. Opposite\nto the entrance, on what is called in Paris \"le carre,\"--that is, the\nsquare landing,--was the door of a back room, opening, on every floor,\ninto a sort of tower built of rough stone, in which was also the well\nfor the staircase. This was the room in which Moreau slept whenever he\nwent to Paris.\n\nPierrotin had seen in the first room, where he deposited the hampers,\nsix wooden chairs with straw seats, a table, and a sideboard; at the\nwindows, discolored curtains. Later, when he entered the salon, he\nnoticed some old Empire furniture, now shabby; but only as much as all\nproprietors exact to secure their rent. Pierrotin judged of the bedroom\nby the salon and dining-room. The wood-work, painted coarsely of a\nreddish white, which thickened and blurred the mouldings and figurines,\nfar from being ornamental, was distressing to the eye. The floors, never\nwaxed, were of that gray tone we see in boarding-schools. When Pierrotin\ncame upon Monsieur and Madame Clapart at their meals he saw that their\nchina, glass, and all other little articles betrayed the utmost poverty;\nand yet, though the chipped and mended dishes and tureens were those\nof the poorest families and provoked pity, the forks and spoons were of\nsilver.\n\nMonsieur Clapart, clothed in a shabby surtout, his feet in broken\nslippers, always wore green spectacles, and exhibited, whenever he\nremoved his shabby cap of a bygone period, a pointed skull, from the top\nof which trailed a few dirty filaments which even a poet could scarcely\ncall hair. This man, of wan complexion, seemed timorous, but withal\ntyrannical.\n\nIn this dreary apartment, which faced the north and had no other outlook\nthan to a vine on the opposite wall and a well in the corner of the\nyard, Madame Clapart bore herself with the airs of a queen, and moved\nlike a woman unaccustomed to go anywhere on foot. Often, while thanking\nPierrotin, she gave him glances which would have touched to pity an\nintelligent observer; from time to time she would slip a twelve-sous\npiece into his hand, and then her voice was charming. Pierrotin had\nnever seen Oscar, for the reason that the boy was always in school at\nthe time his business took him to the house.\n\nHere is the sad story which Pierrotin could never have discovered, even\nby asking for information, as he sometimes did, from the portress of\nthe house; for that individual knew nothing beyond the fact that the\nClaparts paid a rent of two hundred and fifty francs a year, had no\nservant but a charwoman who came daily for a few hours in the morning,\nthat Madame Clapart did some of her smaller washing herself, and paid\nthe postage on her letters daily, being apparently unable to let the sum\naccumulate.\n\nThere does not exist, or rather, there seldom exists, a criminal who is\nwholly criminal. Neither do we ever meet with a dishonest nature which\nis completely dishonest. It is possible for a man to cheat his master\nto his own advantage, or rake in for himself alone all the hay in\nthe manger, but, even while laying up capital by actions more or\nless illicit, there are few men who never do good ones. If only from\nself-love, curiosity, or by way of variety, or by chance, every man has\nhis moment of beneficence; he may call it his error, he may never do it\nagain, but he sacrifices to Goodness, as the most surly man sacrifices\nto the Graces once or twice in his life. If Moreau's faults can ever\nbe excused, it might be on the score of his persistent kindness in\nsuccoring a woman of whose favors he had once been proud, and in whose\nhouse he was hidden when in peril of his life.\n\nThis woman, celebrated under the Directory for her liaison with one\nof the five kings of that reign, married, through that all-powerful\nprotection, a purveyor who was making his millions out of the\ngovernment, and whom Napoleon ruined in 1802. This man, named Husson,\nbecame insane through his sudden fall from opulence to poverty; he flung\nhimself into the Seine, leaving the beautiful Madame Husson pregnant.\nMoreau, very intimately allied with Madame Husson, was at that time\ncondemned to death; he was unable therefore to marry the widow, being\nforced to leave France. Madame Husson, then twenty-two years old,\nmarried in her deep distress a government clerk named Clapart, aged\ntwenty-seven, who was said to be a rising man. At that period of our\nhistory, government clerks were apt to become persons of importance;\nfor Napoleon was ever on the lookout for capacity. But Clapart, though\nendowed by nature with a certain coarse beauty, proved to have no\nintelligence. Thinking Madame Husson very rich, he feigned a great\npassion for her, and was simply saddled with the impossibility of\nsatisfying either then or in the future the wants she had acquired in a\nlife of opulence. He filled, very poorly, a place in the Treasury that\ngave him a salary of eighteen hundred francs; which was all the\nnew household had to live on. When Moreau returned to France as the\nsecretary of the Comte de Serizy he heard of Madame Husson's pitiable\ncondition, and he was able, before his own marriage, to get her an\nappointment as head-waiting-woman to Madame Mere, the Emperor's mother.\nBut in spite of that powerful protection Clapart was never promoted; his\nincapacity was too apparent.\n\nRuined in 1815 by the fall of the Empire, the brilliant Aspasia of the\nDirectory had no other resources than Clapart's salary of twelve hundred\nfrancs from a clerkship obtained for him through the Comte de Serizy.\nMoreau, the only protector of a woman whom he had known in possession of\nmillions, obtained a half-scholarship for her son, Oscar Husson, at\nthe school of Henri IV.; and he sent her regularly, by Pierrotin, such\nsupplies from the estate at Presles as he could decently offer to a\nhousehold in distress.\n\nOscar was the whole life and all the future of his mother. The poor\nwoman could now be reproached with no other fault than her exaggerated\ntenderness for her boy,--the bete-noire of his step-father. Oscar was,\nunfortunately, endowed by nature with a foolishness his mother did not\nperceive, in spite of the step-father's sarcasms. This foolishness--or,\nto speak more specifically, this overweening conceit--so troubled\nMonsieur Moreau that he begged Madame Clapart to send the boy down to\nhim for a month that he might study his character, and find out what\ncareer he was fit for. Moreau was really thinking of some day proposing\nOscar to the count as his successor.\n\nBut to give to the devil and to God what respectively belongs to them,\nperhaps it would be well to show the causes of Oscar Husson's silly\nself-conceit, premising that he was born in the household of Madame\nMere. During his early childhood his eyes were dazzled by imperial\nsplendors. His pliant imagination retained the impression of those\ngorgeous scenes, and nursed the images of a golden time of pleasure\nin hopes of recovering them. The natural boastfulness of school-boys\n(possessed of a desire to outshine their mates) resting on these\nmemories of his childhood was developed in him beyond all measure. It\nmay also have been that his mother at home dwelt too fondly on the days\nwhen she herself was a queen in Directorial Paris. At any rate, Oscar,\nwho was now leaving school, had been made to bear many humiliations\nwhich the paying pupils put upon those who hold scholarships, unless the\nscholars are able to impose respect by superior physical ability.\n\nThis mixture of former splendor now departed, of beauty gone, of blind\nmaternal love, of sufferings heroically borne, made the mother one of\nthose pathetic figures which catch the eye of many an observer in Paris.\n\nIncapable, naturally, of understanding the real attachment of Moreau to\nthis woman, or that of the woman for the man she had saved in 1797,\nnow her only friend, Pierrotin did not think it best to communicate\nthe suspicion that had entered his head as to some danger which was\nthreatening Moreau. The valet's speech, \"We have enough to do in this\nworld to look after ourselves,\" returned to his mind, and with it came\nthat sentiment of obedience to what he called the \"chefs de file,\"--the\nfront-rank men in war, and men of rank in peace. Besides, just now\nPierrotin's head was as full of his own stings as there are five-franc\npieces in a thousand francs. So that the \"Very good, madame,\"\n\"Certainly, madame,\" with which he replied to the poor mother, to whom a\ntrip of twenty miles appeared a journey, showed plainly that he desired\nto get away from her useless and prolix instructions.\n\n\"You will be sure to place the packages so that they cannot get wet if\nthe weather should happen to change.\"\n\n\"I've a hood,\" replied Pierrotin. \"Besides, see, madame, with what care\nthey are being placed.\"\n\n\"Oscar, don't stay more than two weeks, no matter how much they may ask\nyou,\" continued Madame Clapart, returning to her son. \"You can't please\nMadame Moreau, whatever you do; besides, you must be home by the end of\nSeptember. We are to go to Belleville, you know, to your uncle Cardot.\"\n\n\"Yes, mamma.\"\n\n\"Above all,\" she said, in a low voice, \"be sure never to speak about\nservants; keep thinking all the time that Madame Moreau was once a\nwaiting-maid.\"\n\n\"Yes, mamma.\"\n\nOscar, like all youths whose vanity is excessively ticklish, seemed\nannoyed at being lectured on the threshold of the Lion d'Argent.\n\n\"Well, now good-bye, mamma. We shall start soon; there's the horse all\nharnessed.\"\n\nThe mother, forgetting that she was in the open street, embraced her\nOscar, and said, smiling, as she took a little roll from her basket:--\n\n\"Tiens! you were forgetting your roll and the chocolate! My child, once\nmore, I repeat, don't take anything at the inns; they'd make you pay for\nthe slightest thing ten times what it is worth.\"\n\nOscar would fain have seen his mother farther off as she stuffed the\nbread and chocolate into his pocket. The scene had two witnesses,--two\nyoung men a few years older than Oscar, better dressed than he,\nwithout a mother hanging on to them, whose actions, dress, and ways all\nbetokened that complete independence which is the one desire of a lad\nstill tied to his mother's apron-strings.\n\n\"He said _mamma_!\" cried one of the new-comers, laughing.\n\nThe words reached Oscar's ears and drove him to say, \"Good-bye, mother!\"\nin a tone of terrible impatience.\n\nLet us admit that Madame Clapart spoke too loudly, and seemed to wish to\nshow to those around them her tenderness for the boy.\n\n\"What is the matter with you, Oscar?\" asked the poor hurt woman. \"I\ndon't know what to make of you,\" she added in a severe tone, fancying\nherself able to inspire him with respect,--a great mistake made by those\nwho spoil their children. \"Listen, my Oscar,\" she said, resuming at once\nher tender voice, \"you have a propensity to talk, and to tell all you\nknow, and all that you don't know; and you do it to show off, with\nthe foolish vanity of a mere lad. Now, I repeat, endeavor to keep your\ntongue in check. You are not sufficiently advanced in life, my treasure,\nto be able to judge of the persons with whom you may be thrown; and\nthere is nothing more dangerous than to talk in public conveyances.\nBesides, in a diligence well-bred persons always keep silence.\"\n\nThe two young men, who seemed to have walked to the farther end of the\nestablishment, here returned, making their boot-heels tap upon the paved\npassage of the porte-cochere. They might have heard the whole of this\nmaternal homily. So, in order to rid himself of his mother, Oscar had\nrecourse to an heroic measure, which proved how vanity stimulates the\nintellect.\n\n\"Mamma,\" he said, \"you are standing in a draught, and you may take cold.\nBesides, I am going to get into the coach.\"\n\nThe lad must have touched some tender spot, for his mother caught him\nto her bosom, kissed him as if he were starting upon a long journey, and\nwent with him to the vehicle with tears in her eyes.\n\n\"Don't forget to give five francs to the servants when you come away,\"\nshe said; \"write me three times at least during the fifteen days; behave\nproperly, and remember all that I have told you. You have linen enough;\ndon't send any to the wash. And above all, remember Monsieur Moreau's\nkindness; mind him as you would a father, and follow his advice.\"\n\nAs he got into the coach, Oscar's blue woollen stockings became visible,\nthrough the action of his trousers which drew up suddenly, also the\nnew patch in the said trousers was seen, through the parting of his\ncoat-tails. The smiles of the two young men, on whom these signs of\nan honorable indigence were not lost, were so many fresh wounds to the\nlad's vanity.\n\n\"The first place was engaged for Oscar,\" said the mother to Pierrotin.\n\"Take the back seat,\" she said to the boy, looking fondly at him with a\nloving smile.\n\nOh! how Oscar regretted that trouble and sorrow had destroyed his\nmother's beauty, and that poverty and self-sacrifice prevented her from\nbeing better dressed! One of the young men, the one who wore top-boots\nand spurs, nudged the other to make him take notice of Oscar's mother,\nand the other twirled his moustache with a gesture which signified,--\n\n\"Rather pretty figure!\"\n\n\"How shall I ever get rid of mamma?\" thought Oscar.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Madame Clapart.\n\nOscar pretended not to hear, the monster! Perhaps Madame Clapart was\nlacking in tact under the circumstances; but all absorbing sentiments\nhave so much egotism!\n\n\"Georges, do you like children when travelling?\" asked one young man of\nthe other.\n\n\"Yes, my good Amaury, if they are weaned, and are named Oscar, and have\nchocolate.\"\n\nThese speeches were uttered in half-tones to allow Oscar to hear them or\nnot hear them as he chose; his countenance was to be the weather-gauge\nby which the other young traveller could judge how much fun he might be\nable to get out of the lad during the journey. Oscar chose not to hear.\nHe looked to see if his mother, who weighed upon him like a nightmare,\nwas still there, for he felt that she loved him too well to leave him\nso quickly. Not only did he involuntarily compare the dress of his\ntravelling companion with his own, but he felt that his mother's toilet\ncounted for much in the smiles of the two young men.\n\n\"If they would only take themselves off!\" he said to himself.\n\nInstead of that, Amaury remarked to Georges, giving a tap with his cane\nto the heavy wheel of the coucou:\n\n\"And so, my friend, you are really going to trust your future to this\nfragile bark?\"\n\n\"I must,\" replied Georges, in a tone of fatalism.\n\nOscar gave a sigh as he remarked the jaunty manner in which his\ncompanion's hat was stuck on one ear for the purpose of showing a\nmagnificent head of blond hair beautifully brushed and curled; while he,\nby order of his step-father, had his black hair cut like a clothes-brush\nacross the forehead, and clipped, like a soldier's, close to the head.\nThe face of the vain lad was round and chubby and bright with the hues\nof health, while that of his fellow-traveller was long, and delicate,\nand pale. The forehead of the latter was broad, and his chest filled\nout a waistcoat of cashmere pattern. As Oscar admired the tight-fitting\niron-gray trousers and the overcoat with its frogs and olives clasping\nthe waist, it seemed to him that this romantic-looking stranger, gifted\nwith such advantages, insulted him by his superiority, just as an ugly\nwoman feels injured by the mere sight of a pretty one. The click of the\nstranger's boot-heels offended his taste and echoed in his heart. He\nfelt as hampered by his own clothes (made no doubt at home out of those\nof his step-father) as that envied young man seemed at ease in his.\n\n\"That fellow must have heaps of francs in his trousers pocket,\" thought\nOscar.\n\nThe young man turned round. What were Oscar's feelings on beholding\na gold chain round his neck, at the end of which no doubt was a gold\nwatch! From that moment the young man assumed, in Oscar's eyes, the\nproportions of a personage.\n\nLiving in the rue de la Cerisaie since 1815, taken to and from school\nby his step-father, Oscar had no other points of comparison since his\nadolescence than the poverty-stricken household of his mother. Brought\nup strictly, by Moreau's advice, he seldom went to the theatre, and\nthen to nothing better than the Ambigu-Comique, where his eyes could see\nlittle elegance, if indeed the eyes of a child riveted on a melodrama\nwere likely to examine the audience. His step-father still wore, after\nthe fashion of the Empire, his watch in the fob of his trousers, from\nwhich there depended over his abdomen a heavy gold chain, ending in a\nbunch of heterogeneous ornaments, seals, and a watch-key with a round\ntop and flat sides, on which was a landscape in mosaic. Oscar,\nwho considered that old-fashioned finery as the \"ne plus ultra\" of\nadornment, was bewildered by the present revelation of superior and\nnegligent elegance. The young man exhibited, offensively, a pair of\nspotless gloves, and seemed to wish to dazzle Oscar by twirling with\nmuch grace a gold-headed switch cane.\n\nOscar had reached that last quarter of adolescence when little things\ncause immense joys and immense miseries,--a period when youth prefers\nmisfortune to a ridiculous suit of clothes, and caring nothing for\nthe real interests of life, torments itself about frivolities, about\nneckcloths, and the passionate desire to appear a man. Then the young\nfellow swells himself out; his swagger is all the more portentous\nbecause it is exercised on nothings. Yet if he envies a fool who is\nelegantly dressed, he is also capable of enthusiasm over talent, and of\ngenuine admiration for genius. Such defects as these, when they have no\nroot in the heart, prove only the exuberance of sap,--the richness of\nthe youthful imagination. That a lad of nineteen, an only child, kept\nseverely at home by poverty, adored by a mother who put upon herself\nall privations for his sake, should be moved to envy by a young man of\ntwenty-two in a frogged surtout-coat silk-lined, a waist-coat of fancy\ncashmere, and a cravat slipped through a ring of the worse taste, is\nnothing more than a peccadillo committed in all ranks of social life by\ninferiors who envy those that seem beyond them. Men of genius themselves\nsuccumb to this primitive passion. Did not Rousseau admire Ventura and\nBacle?\n\nBut Oscar passed from peccadillo to evil feelings. He felt humiliated;\nhe was angry with the youth he envied, and there rose in his heart a\nsecret desire to show openly that he himself was as good as the object\nof his envy.\n\nThe two young fellows continued to walk up and own from the gate to the\nstables, and from the stables to the gate. Each time they turned they\nlooked at Oscar curled up in his corner of the coucou. Oscar, persuaded\nthat their jokes and laughter concerned himself, affected the utmost\nindifference. He began to hum the chorus of a song lately brought into\nvogue by the liberals, which ended with the words, \"'Tis Voltaire's\nfault, 'tis Rousseau's fault.\"\n\n\"Tiens! perhaps he is one of the chorus at the Opera,\" said Amaury.\n\nThis exasperated Oscar, who bounded up, pulled out the wooden \"back,\"\nand called to Pierrotin:--\n\n\"When do we start?\"\n\n\"Presently,\" said that functionary, who was standing, whip in hand, and\ngazing toward the rue d'Enghien.\n\nAt this moment the scene was enlivened by the arrival of a young man\naccompanied by a true \"gamin,\" who was followed by a porter dragging\na hand-cart. The young man came up to Pierrotin and spoke to him\nconfidentially, on which the latter nodded his head, and called to his\nown porter. The man ran out and helped to unload the little hand-cart,\nwhich contained, besides two trunks, buckets, brushes, boxes of singular\nshape, and an infinity of packages and utensils which the youngest of\nthe new-comers, who had climbed into the imperial, stowed away with\nsuch celerity that Oscar, who happened to be smiling at his mother, now\nstanding on the other side of the street, saw none of the paraphernalia\nwhich might have revealed to him the profession of his new travelling\ncompanion.\n\nThe gamin, who must have been sixteen years of age, wore a gray blouse\nbuckled round his waist by a polished leather belt. His cap, jauntily\nperched on the side of his head, seemed the sign of a merry nature, and\nso did the picturesque disorder of the curly brown hair which fell upon\nhis shoulders. A black-silk cravat drew a line round his very white\nneck, and added to the vivacity of his bright gray eyes. The animation\nof his brown and rosy face, the moulding of his rather large lips, the\nears detached from his head, his slightly turned-up nose,--in fact, all\nthe details of his face proclaimed the lively spirit of a Figaro, and\nthe careless gayety of youth, while the vivacity of his gesture and his\nmocking eye revealed an intellect already developed by the practice of a\nprofession adopted very early in life. As he had already some claims\nto personal value, this child, made man by Art or by vocation, seemed\nindifferent to the question of costume; for he looked at his boots,\nwhich had not been polished, with a quizzical air, and searched for\nthe spots on his brown Holland trousers less to remove them than to see\ntheir effect.\n\n\"I'm in style,\" he said, giving himself a shake and addressing his\ncompanion.\n\nThe glance of the latter, showed authority over his adept, in whom\na practised eye would at once have recognized the joyous pupil of a\npainter, called in the argot of the studios a \"rapin.\"\n\n\"Behave yourself, Mistigris,\" said his master, giving him the nickname\nwhich the studio had no doubt bestowed upon him.\n\nThe master was a slight and pale young man, with extremely thick black\nhair, worn in a disorder that was actually fantastic. But this abundant\nmass of hair seemed necessary to an enormous head, whose vast forehead\nproclaimed a precocious intellect. A strained and harassed face, too\noriginal to be ugly, was hollowed as if this noticeable young man\nsuffered from some chronic malady, or from privations caused by poverty\n(the most terrible of all chronic maladies), or from griefs too recent\nto be forgotten. His clothing, analogous, with due allowance, to that of\nMistigris, consisted of a shabby surtout coat, American-green in color,\nmuch worn, but clean and well-brushed; a black waistcoat buttoned to the\nthroat, which almost concealed a scarlet neckerchief; and trousers,\nalso black and even more worn than the coat, flapping his thin legs. In\naddition, a pair of very muddy boots indicated that he had come on\nfoot and from some distance to the coach office. With a rapid look this\nartist seized the whole scene of the Lion d'Argent, the stables, the\ncourtyard, the various lights and shades, and the details; then he\nlooked at Mistigris, whose satirical glance had followed his own.\n\n\"Charming!\" said Mistigris.\n\n\"Yes, very,\" replied the other.\n\n\"We seem to have got here too early,\" pursued Mistigris. \"Couldn't we\nget a mouthful somewhere? My stomach, like Nature, abhors a vacuum.\"\n\n\"Have we time to get a cup of coffee?\" said the artist, in a gentle\nvoice, to Pierrotin.\n\n\"Yes, but don't be long,\" answered the latter.\n\n\"Good; that means we have a quarter of an hour,\" remarked Mistigris,\nwith the innate genius for observation of the Paris rapin.\n\nThe pair disappeared. Nine o'clock was striking in the hotel kitchen.\nGeorges thought it just and reasonable to remonstrate with Pierrotin.\n\n\"Hey! my friend; when a man is blessed with such wheels as these\n(striking the clumsy tires with his cane) he ought at least to have the\nmerit of punctuality. The deuce! one doesn't get into that thing for\npleasure; I have business that is devilishly pressing or I wouldn't\ntrust my bones to it. And that horse, which you call Rougeot, he doesn't\nlook likely to make up for lost time.\"\n\n\"We are going to harness Bichette while those gentlemen take their\ncoffee,\" replied Pierrotin. \"Go and ask, you,\" he said to his porter,\n\"if Pere Leger is coming with us--\"\n\n\"Where is your Pere Leger?\" asked Georges.\n\n\"Over the way, at number 50. He couldn't get a place in the Beaumont\ndiligence,\" said Pierrotin, still speaking to his porter and apparently\nmaking no answer to his customer; then he disappeared himself in search\nof Bichette.\n\nGeorges, after shaking hands with his friend, got into the coach,\nhandling with an air of great importance a portfolio which he placed\nbeneath the cushion of the seat. He took the opposite corner to that of\nOscar, on the same seat.\n\n\"This Pere Leger troubles me,\" he said.\n\n\"They can't take away our places,\" replied Oscar. \"I have number one.\"\n\n\"And I number two,\" said Georges.\n\nJust as Pierrotin reappeared, having harnessed Bichette, the porter\nreturned with a stout man in tow, whose weight could not have been less\nthan two hundred and fifty pounds at the very least. Pere Leger belonged\nto the species of farmer which has a square back, a protuberant stomach,\na powdered pigtail, and wears a little coat of blue linen. His white\ngaiters, coming above the knee, were fastened round the ends of his\nvelveteen breeches and secured by silver buckles. His hob-nailed shoes\nweighed two pounds each. In his hand, he held a small reddish stick,\nmuch polished, with a large knob, which was fastened round his wrist by\na thong of leather.\n\n\"And you are called Pere Leger?\" asked Georges, very seriously, as the\nfarmer attempted to put a foot on the step.\n\n\"At your service,\" replied the farmer, looking in and showing a face\nlike that of Louis XVIII., with fat, rubicund cheeks, from between which\nissued a nose that in any other face would have seemed enormous. His\nsmiling eyes were sunken in rolls of fat. \"Come, a helping hand, my\nlad!\" he said to Pierrotin.\n\nThe farmer was hoisted in by the united efforts of Pierrotin and the\nporter, to cries of \"Houp la! hi! ha! hoist!\" uttered by Georges.\n\n\"Oh! I'm not going far; only to La Cave,\" said the farmer,\ngood-humoredly.\n\nIn France everybody takes a joke.\n\n\"Take the back seat,\" said Pierrotin, \"there'll be six of you.\"\n\n\"Where's your other horse?\" demanded Georges. \"Is it as mythical as the\nthird post-horse.\"\n\n\"There she is,\" said Pierrotin, pointing to the little mare, who was\ncoming along alone.\n\n\"He calls that insect a horse!\" exclaimed Georges.\n\n\"Oh! she's good, that little mare,\" said the farmer, who by this time\nwas seated. \"Your servant, gentlemen. Well, Pierrotin, how soon do you\nstart?\"\n\n\"I have two travellers in there after a cup of coffee,\" replied\nPierrotin.\n\nThe hollow-cheeked young man and his page reappeared.\n\n\"Come, let's start!\" was the general cry.\n\n\"We are going to start,\" replied Pierrotin. \"Now, then, make ready,\" he\nsaid to the porter, who began thereupon to take away the stones which\nstopped the wheels.\n\nPierrotin took Rougeot by the bridle and gave that guttural cry, \"Ket,\nket!\" to tell the two animals to collect their energy; on which, though\nevidently stiff, they pulled the coach to the door of the Lion d'Argent.\nAfter which manoeuvre, which was purely preparatory, Pierrotin gazed up\nthe rue d'Enghien and then disappeared, leaving the coach in charge of\nthe porter.\n\n\"Ah ca! is he subject to such attacks,--that master of yours?\" said\nMistigris, addressing the porter.\n\n\"He has gone to fetch his feed from the stable,\" replied the porter,\nwell versed in all the usual tricks to keep passengers quiet.\n\n\"Well, after all,\" said Mistigris, \"'art is long, but life is short'--to\nBichette.\"\n\nAt this particular epoch, a fancy for mutilating or transposing proverbs\nreigned in the studios. It was thought a triumph to find changes of\nletters, and sometimes of words, which still kept the semblance of the\nproverb while giving it a fantastic or ridiculous meaning.[*]\n\n  [*] It is plainly impossible to translate many of these proverbs\n      and put any fun or meaning into them.--Tr.\n\n\"Patience, Mistigris!\" said his master; \"'come wheel, come whoa.'\"\n\nPierrotin here returned, bringing with him the Comte de Serizy, who had\ncome through the rue de l'Echiquier, and with whom he had doubtless had\na short conversation.\n\n\"Pere Leger,\" said Pierrotin, looking into the coach, \"will you give\nyour place to Monsieur le comte? That will balance the carriage better.\"\n\n\"We sha'n't be off for an hour if you go on this way,\" cried Georges.\n\"We shall have to take down this infernal bar, which cost such trouble\nto put up. Why should everybody be made to move for the man who comes\nlast? We all have a right to the places we took. What place has monsieur\nengaged? Come, find that out! Haven't you a way-book, a register, or\nsomething? What place has Monsieur Lecomte engaged?--count of what, I'd\nlike to know.\"\n\n\"Monsieur le comte,\" said Pierrotin, visibly troubled, \"I am afraid you\nwill be uncomfortable.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you keep better count of us?\" said Mistigris. \"'Short counts\nmake good ends.'\"\n\n\"Mistigris, behave yourself,\" said his master.\n\nMonsieur de Serizy was evidently taken by all the persons in the coach\nfor a bourgeois of the name of Lecomte.\n\n\"Don't disturb any one,\" he said to Pierrotin. \"I will sit with you in\nfront.\"\n\n\"Come, Mistigris,\" said the master to his rapin, \"remember the respect\nyou owe to age; you don't know how shockingly old you may be yourself\nsome day. 'Travel deforms youth.' Give your place to monsieur.\"\n\nMistigris opened the leathern curtain and jumped out with the agility of\na frog leaping into the water.\n\n\"You mustn't be a rabbit, august old man,\" he said to the count.\n\n\"Mistigris, 'ars est celare bonum,'\" said his master.\n\n\"I thank you very much, monsieur,\" said the count to Mistigris's master,\nnext to whom he now sat.\n\nThe minister of State cast a sagacious glance round the interior of the\ncoach, which greatly affronted both Oscar and Georges.\n\n\"When persons want to be master of a coach, they should engage all the\nplaces,\" remarked Georges.\n\nCertain now of his incognito, the Comte de Serizy made no reply to this\nobservation, but assumed the air of a good-natured bourgeois.\n\n\"Suppose you were late, wouldn't you be glad that the coach waited for\nyou?\" said the farmer to the two young men.\n\nPierrotin still looked up and down the street, whip in hand, apparently\nreluctant to mount to the hard seat where Mistigris was fidgeting.\n\n\"If you expect some one else, I am not the last,\" said the count.\n\n\"I agree to that reasoning,\" said Mistigris.\n\nGeorges and Oscar began to laugh impertinently.\n\n\"The old fellow doesn't know much,\" whispered Georges to Oscar, who was\ndelighted at this apparent union between himself and the object of his\nenvy.\n\n\"Parbleu!\" cried Pierrotin, \"I shouldn't be sorry for two more\npassengers.\"\n\n\"I haven't paid; I'll get out,\" said Georges, alarmed.\n\n\"What are you waiting for, Pierrotin?\" asked Pere Leger.\n\nWhereupon Pierrotin shouted a certain \"Hi!\" in which Bichette and\nRougeot recognized a definitive resolution, and they both sprang toward\nthe rise of the faubourg at a pace which was soon to slacken.\n\nThe count had a red face, of a burning red all over, on which were\ncertain inflamed portions which his snow-white hair brought out into\nfull relief. To any but heedless youths, this complexion would have\nrevealed a constant inflammation of the blood, produced by incessant\nlabor. These blotches and pimples so injured the naturally noble air of\nthe count that careful examination was needed to find in his green-gray\neyes the shrewdness of the magistrate, the wisdom of a statesman, and\nthe knowledge of a legislator. His face was flat, and the nose seemed\nto have been depressed into it. The hat hid the grace and beauty of his\nforehead. In short, there was enough to amuse those thoughtless youths\nin the odd contrasts of the silvery hair, the burning face, and the\nthick, tufted eye-brows which were still jet-black.\n\nThe count wore a long blue overcoat, buttoned in military fashion to the\nthroat, a white cravat around his neck, cotton wool in his ears, and a\nshirt-collar high enough to make a large square patch of white on each\ncheek. His black trousers covered his boots, the toes of which were\nbarely seen. He wore no decoration in his button-hole, and doeskin\ngloves concealed his hands. Nothing about him betrayed to the eyes of\nyouth a peer of France, and one of the most useful statesmen in the\nkingdom.\n\nPere Leger had never seen the count, who, on his side, knew the former\nonly by name. When the count, as he got into the carriage, cast the\nglance about him which affronted Georges and Oscar, he was, in reality,\nlooking for the head-clerk of his notary (in case he had been forced,\nlike himself, to take Pierrotin's vehicle), intending to caution\nhim instantly about his own incognito. But feeling reassured by the\nappearance of Oscar, and that of Pere Leger, and, above all, by the\nquasi-military air, the waxed moustaches, and the general look of an\nadventurer that distinguished Georges, he concluded that his note had\nreached his notary, Alexandre Crottat, in time to prevent the departure\nof the clerk.\n\n\"Pere Leger,\" said Pierrotin, when they reached the steep hill of the\nfaubourg Saint-Denis by the rue de la Fidelite, \"suppose we get out,\nhey?\"\n\n\"I'll get out, too,\" said the count, hearing Leger's name.\n\n\"Goodness! if this is how we are going, we shall do fourteen miles in\nfifteen days!\" cried Georges.\n\n\"It isn't my fault,\" said Pierrotin, \"if a passenger wishes to get out.\"\n\n\"Ten louis for you if you keep the secret of my being here as I told you\nbefore,\" said the count in a low voice, taking Pierrotin by the arm.\n\n\"Oh, my thousand francs!\" thought Pierrotin as he winked an eye at\nMonsieur de Serizy, which meant, \"Rely on me.\"\n\nOscar and Georges stayed in the coach.\n\n\"Look here, Pierrotin, since Pierrotin you are,\" cried Georges, when the\npassengers were once more stowed away in the vehicle, \"if you don't mean\nto go faster than this, say so! I'll pay my fare and take a post-horse\nat Saint-Denis, for I have important business on hand which can't be\ndelayed.\"\n\n\"Oh! he'll go well enough,\" said Pere Leger. \"Besides, the distance\nisn't great.\"\n\n\"I am never more than half an hour late,\" asserted Pierrotin.\n\n\"Well, you are not wheeling the Pope in this old barrow of yours,\" said\nGeorges, \"so, get on.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he's afraid of shaking monsieur,\" said Mistigris looking round\nat the count. \"But you shouldn't have preferences, Pierrotin, it isn't\nright.\"\n\n\"Coucous and the Charter make all Frenchmen equals,\" said Georges.\n\n\"Oh! be easy,\" said Pere Leger; \"we are sure to get to La Chapelle by\nmid-day,\"--La Chapelle being the village next beyond the Barriere of\nSaint-Denis.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. THE GRANDSON OF THE FAMOUS CZERNI-GEORGES\n\n\nThose who travel in public conveyances know that the persons thus united\nby chance do not immediately have anything to say to one another; unless\nunder special circumstances, conversation rarely begins until they have\ngone some distance. This period of silence is employed as much in mutual\nexamination as in settling into their places. Minds need to get their\nequilibrium as much as bodies. When each person thinks he has discovered\nthe age, profession, and character of his companions, the most talkative\nmember of the company begins, and the conversation gets under way with\nall the more vivacity because those present feel a need of enlivening\nthe journey and forgetting its tedium.\n\nThat is how things happen in French stage-coaches. In other countries\ncustoms are very different. Englishmen pique themselves on never opening\ntheir lips; Germans are melancholy in a vehicle; Italians too wary to\ntalk; Spaniards have no public conveyances; and Russians no roads.\nThere is no amusement except in the lumbering diligences of France, that\ngabbling and indiscreet country, where every one is in a hurry to laugh\nand show his wit, and where jest and epigram enliven all things, even\nthe poverty of the lower classes and the weightier cares of the\nsolid bourgeois. In a coach there is no police to check tongues, and\nlegislative assemblies have set the fashion of public discussion. When\na young man of twenty-two, like the one named Georges, is clever and\nlively, he is much tempted, especially under circumstances like the\npresent, to abuse those qualities.\n\nIn the first place, Georges had soon decided that he was the superior\nhuman being of the party there assembled. He saw in the count a\nmanufacturer of the second-class, whom he took, for some unknown reason,\nto be a chandler; in the shabby young man accompanied by Mistigris,\na fellow of no account; in Oscar a ninny, and in Pere Leger, the fat\nfarmer, an excellent subject to hoax. Having thus looked over the\nground, he resolved to amuse himself at the expense of such companions.\n\n\"Let me see,\" he thought to himself, as the coucou went down the hill\nfrom La Chapelle to the plain of Saint-Denis, \"shall I pass myself\noff for Etienne or Beranger? No, these idiots don't know who they are.\nCarbonaro? the deuce! I might get myself arrested. Suppose I say I'm the\nson of Marshal Ney? Pooh! what could I tell them?--about the execution\nof my father? It wouldn't be funny. Better be a disguised Russian prince\nand make them swallow a lot of stuff about the Emperor Alexander. Or I\nmight be Cousin, and talk philosophy; oh, couldn't I perplex 'em! But\nno, that shabby fellow with the tousled head looks to me as if he\nhad jogged his way through the Sorbonne. What a pity! I can mimic\nan Englishman so perfectly I might have pretended to be Lord Byron,\ntravelling incognito. Sapristi! I'll command the troops of Ali, pacha of\nJanina!\"\n\nDuring this mental monologue, the coucou rolled through clouds of dust\nrising on either side of it from that much travelled road.\n\n\"What dust!\" cried Mistigris.\n\n\"Henry IV. is dead!\" retorted his master. \"If you'd say it was scented\nwith vanilla that would be emitting a new opinion.\"\n\n\"You think you're witty,\" replied Mistigris. \"Well, it _is_ like vanilla\nat times.\"\n\n\"In the Levant--\" said Georges, with the air of beginning a story.\n\n\"'Ex Oriente flux,'\" remarked Mistigris's master, interrupting the\nspeaker.\n\n\"I said in the Levant, from which I have just returned,\" continued\nGeorges, \"the dust smells very good; but here it smells of nothing,\nexcept in some old dust-barrel like this.\"\n\n\"Has monsieur lately returned from the Levant?\" said Mistigris,\nmaliciously. \"He isn't much tanned by the sun.\"\n\n\"Oh! I've just left my bed after an illness of three months, from the\ngerm, so the doctors said, of suppressed plague.\"\n\n\"Have you had the plague?\" cried the count, with a gesture of alarm.\n\"Pierrotin, stop!\"\n\n\"Go on, Pierrotin,\" said Mistigris. \"Didn't you hear him say it was\ninward, his plague?\" added the rapin, talking back to Monsieur de\nSerizy. \"It isn't catching; it only comes out in conversation.\"\n\n\"Mistigris! if you interfere again I'll have you put off into the road,\"\nsaid his master. \"And so,\" he added, turning to Georges, \"monsieur has\nbeen to the East?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur; first to Egypt, then to Greece, where I served under\nAli, pacha of Janina, with whom I had a terrible quarrel. There's no\nenduring those climates long; besides, the emotions of all kinds in\nOriental life have disorganized my liver.\"\n\n\"What, have you served as a soldier?\" asked the fat farmer. \"How old are\nyou?\"\n\n\"Twenty-nine,\" replied Georges, whereupon all the passengers looked at\nhim. \"At eighteen I enlisted as a private for the famous campaign of\n1813; but I was present at only one battle, that of Hanau, where I was\npromoted sergeant-major. In France, at Montereau, I won the rank of\nsub-lieutenant, and was decorated by,--there are no informers here, I'm\nsure,--by the Emperor.\"\n\n\"What! are you decorated?\" cried Oscar. \"Why don't you wear your cross?\"\n\n\"The cross of 'ceux-ci'? No, thank you! Besides, what man of any\nbreeding would wear his decorations in travelling? There's monsieur,\" he\nsaid, motioning to the Comte de Serizy. \"I'll bet whatever you like--\"\n\n\"Betting whatever you like means, in France, betting nothing at all,\"\nsaid Mistigris's master.\n\n\"I'll bet whatever you like,\" repeated Georges, incisively, \"that\nmonsieur here is covered with stars.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the count, laughing, \"I have the grand cross of the Legion\nof honor, that of Saint Andrew of Russia, that of the Prussian Eagle,\nthat of the Annunciation of Sardinia, and the Golden Fleece.\"\n\n\"Beg pardon,\" said Mistigris, \"are they all in the coucou?\"\n\n\"Hey! that brick-colored old fellow goes it strong!\" whispered Georges\nto Oscar. \"What was I saying?--oh! I know. I don't deny that I adore the\nEmperor--\"\n\n\"I served under him,\" said the count.\n\n\"What a man he was, wasn't he?\" cried Georges.\n\n\"A man to whom I owe many obligations,\" replied the count, with a silly\nexpression that was admirably assumed.\n\n\"For all those crosses?\" inquired Mistigris.\n\n\"And what quantities of snuff he took!\" continued Monsieur de Serizy.\n\n\"He carried it loose in his pockets,\" said Georges.\n\n\"So I've been told,\" remarked Pere Leger with an incredulous look.\n\n\"Worse than that; he chewed and smoked,\" continued Georges. \"I saw him\nsmoking, in a queer way, too, at Waterloo, when Marshal Soult took him\nround the waist and flung him into his carriage, just as he had seized a\nmusket and was going to charge the English--\"\n\n\"You were at Waterloo!\" cried Oscar, his eyes stretching wide open.\n\n\"Yes, young man, I did the campaign of 1815. I was a captain at\nMont-Saint-Jean, and I retired to the Loire, after we were all\ndisbanded. Faith! I was disgusted with France; I couldn't stand it. In\nfact, I should certainly have got myself arrested; so off I went, with\ntwo or three dashing fellows,--Selves, Besson, and others, who are now\nin Egypt,--and we entered the service of pacha Mohammed; a queer sort of\nfellow he was, too! Once a tobacco merchant in the bazaars, he is now\non the high-road to be a sovereign prince. You've all seen him in\nthat picture by Horace Vernet,--'The Massacre of the Mameluks.' What\na handsome fellow he was! But I wouldn't give up the religion of my\nfathers and embrace Islamism; all the more because the abjuration\nrequired a surgical operation which I hadn't any fancy for. Besides,\nnobody respects a renegade. Now if they had offered me a hundred\nthousand francs a year, perhaps--and yet, no! The pacha did give me a\nthousand talari as a present.\"\n\n\"How much is that?\" asked Oscar, who was listening to Georges with all\nhis ears.\n\n\"Oh! not much. A talaro is, as you might say, a five-franc piece.\nBut faith! I got no compensation for the vices I contracted in that\nGod-forsaken country, if country it is. I can't live now without smoking\na narghile twice a-day, and that's very costly.\"\n\n\"How did you find Egypt?\" asked the count.\n\n\"Egypt? Oh! Egypt is all sand,\" replied Georges, by no means taken\naback. \"There's nothing green but the valley of the Nile. Draw a\ngreen line down a sheet of yellow paper, and you have Egypt. But those\nEgyptians--fellahs they are called--have an immense advantage over us.\nThere are no gendarmes in that country. You may go from end to end of\nEgypt, and you won't see one.\"\n\n\"But I suppose there are a good many Egyptians,\" said Mistigris.\n\n\"Not as many as you think for,\" replied Georges. \"There are many more\nAbyssinians, and Giaours, and Vechabites, Bedouins, and Cophs. But all\nthat kind of animal is very uninteresting, and I was glad enough to\nembark on a Genoese polacca which was loading for the Ionian Islands\nwith gunpowder and munitions for Ali de Tebelen. You know, don't\nyou, that the British sell powder and munitions of war to all the\nworld,--Turks, Greeks, and the devil, too, if the devil has money? From\nZante we were to skirt the coasts of Greece and tack about, on and off.\nNow it happens that my name of Georges is famous in that country. I am,\nsuch as you see me, the grandson of the famous Czerni-Georges who made\nwar upon the Porte, and, instead of crushing it, as he meant to do, got\ncrushed himself. His son took refuge in the house of the French consul\nat Smyrna, and he afterwards died in Paris, leaving my mother pregnant\nwith me, his seventh child. Our property was all stolen by friends of\nmy grandfather; in fact, we were ruined. My mother, who lived on her\ndiamonds, which she sold one by one, married, in 1799, my step-father,\nMonsieur Yung, a purveyor. But my mother is dead, and I have quarrelled\nwith my step-father, who, between ourselves, is a blackguard; he is\nstill alive, but I never see him. That's why, in despair, left all to\nmyself, I went off to the wars as a private in 1813. Well, to go back\nto the time I returned to Greece; you wouldn't believe with what joy old\nAli Tebelen received the grandson of Czerni-Georges. Here, of course, I\ncall myself simply Georges. The pacha gave me a harem--\"\n\n\"You have had a harem?\" said Oscar.\n\n\"Were you a pacha with _many_ tails?\" asked Mistigris.\n\n\"How is it that you don't know,\" replied Georges, \"that only the Sultan\nmakes pachas, and that my friend Tebelen (for we were as friendly as\nBourbons) was in rebellion against the Padishah! You know, or you don't\nknow, that the true title of the Grand Seignior is Padishah, and not\nSultan or Grand Turk. You needn't think that a harem is much of a thing;\nyou might as well have a herd of goats. The women are horribly\nstupid down there; I much prefer the grisettes of the Chaumieres at\nMont-Parnasse.\"\n\n\"They are nearer, at any rate,\" said the count.\n\n\"The women of the harem couldn't speak a word of French, and that\nlanguage is indispensable for talking. Ali gave me five legitimate wives\nand ten slaves; that's equivalent to having none at all at Janina. In\nthe East, you must know, it is thought very bad style to have wives and\nwomen. They have them, just as we have Voltaire and Rousseau; but who\never opens his Voltaire or his Rousseau? Nobody. But, for all that, the\nhighest style is to be jealous. They sew a woman up in a sack and fling\nher into the water on the slightest suspicion,--that's according to\ntheir Code.\"\n\n\"Did you fling any in?\" asked the farmer.\n\n\"I, a Frenchman! for shame! I loved them.\"\n\nWhereupon Georges twirled and twisted his moustache with a dreamy air.\n\nThey were now entering Saint-Denis, and Pierrotin presently drew up\nbefore the door of a tavern where were sold the famous cheese-cakes of\nthat place. All the travellers got out. Puzzled by the apparent truth\nmingled with Georges' inventions, the count returned to the coucou when\nthe others had entered the house, and looked beneath the cushion for\nthe portfolio which Pierrotin told him that enigmatical youth had\nplaced there. On it he read the words in gilt letters: \"Maitre Crottat,\nnotary.\" The count at once opened it, and fearing, with some reason,\nthat Pere Leger might be seized with the same curiosity, he took out the\ndeed of sale for the farm at Moulineaux, put it into his coat pocket,\nand entered the inn to keep an eye on the travellers.\n\n\"This Georges is neither more nor less than Crottat's second clerk,\"\nthought he. \"I shall pay my compliments to his master, whose business it\nwas to send me his head-clerk.\"\n\nFrom the respectful glances of Pere Leger and Oscar, Georges perceived\nthat he had made for himself two fervent admirers. Accordingly, he now\nposed as a great personage; paid for their cheese-cakes, and ordered\nfor each a glass of Alicante. He offered the same to Mistigris and his\nmaster, who refused with smiles; but the friend of Ali Tebelen profited\nby the occasion to ask the pair their names.\n\n\"Oh! monsieur,\" said Mistigris' master, \"I am not blessed, like you,\nwith an illustrious name; and I have not returned from Asia--\"\n\nAt this moment the count, hastening into the huge inn-kitchen lest his\nabsence should excite inquiry, entered the place in time to hear the\nconclusion of the young man's speech.\n\n\"--I am only a poor painter lately returned from Rome, where I went at\nthe cost of the government, after winning the 'grand prix' five years\nago. My name is Schinner.\"\n\n\"Hey! bourgeois, may I offer you a glass of Alicante and some\ncheese-cakes?\" said Georges to the count.\n\n\"Thank you,\" replied the latter. \"I never leave home without taking my\ncup of coffee and cream.\"\n\n\"Don't you eat anything between meals? How bourgeois, Marais, Place\nRoyale, that is!\" cried Georges. \"When he 'blagued' just now about his\ncrosses, I thought there was something in him,\" whispered the Eastern\nhero to the painter. \"However, we'll set him going on his decorations,\nthe old tallow-chandler! Come, my lad,\" he added, calling to Oscar,\n\"drink me down the glass poured out for the chandler; that will start\nyour moustache.\"\n\nOscar, anxious to play the man, swallowed the second glass of wine, and\nate three more cheese-cakes.\n\n\"Good wine, that!\" said Pere Leger, smacking his lips.\n\n\"It is all the better,\" said Georges, \"because it comes from Bercy. I've\nbeen to Alicante myself, and I know that this wine no more resembles\nwhat is made there than my arm is like a windmill. Our made-up wines are\na great deal better than the natural ones in their own country. Come,\nPierrotin, take a glass! It is a great pity your horses can't take one,\ntoo; we might go faster.\"\n\n\"Forward, march!\" cried Pierrotin, amid a mighty cracking of whips,\nafter the travellers were again boxed up.\n\nIt was now eleven o'clock. The weather, which had been cloudy, cleared;\nthe breeze swept off the mists, and the blue of the sky appeared in\nspots; so that when the coucou trundled along the narrow strip of road\nfrom Saint-Denis to Pierrefitte, the sun had fairly drunk up the last\nfloating vapors of the diaphanous veil which swathed the scenery of that\nfamous region.\n\n\"Well, now, tell us why you left your friend the pacha,\" said Pere\nLeger, addressing Georges.\n\n\"He was a very singular scamp,\" replied Georges, with an air that hid a\nmultitude of mysteries. \"He put me in command of his cavalry,--so far,\nso good--\"\n\n\"Ah! that's why he wears spurs,\" thought poor Oscar.\n\n\"At that time Ali Tebelen wanted to rid himself of Chosrew pacha,\nanother queer chap! You call him, here, Chaureff; but the name is\npronounced, in Turkish, Cosserew. You must have read in the newspapers\nhow old Ali drubbed Chosrew, and soundly, too, faith! Well, if it\nhadn't been for me, Ali Tebelen himself would have bit the dust two days\nearlier. I was at the right wing, and I saw Chosrew, an old sly-boots,\nthinking to force our centre,--ranks closed, stiff, swift, fine movement\na la Murat. Good! I take my time; then I charge, double-quick, and cut\nhis line in two,--you understand? Ha! ha! after the affair was over, Ali\nkissed me--\"\n\n\"Do they do that in the East?\" asked the count, in a joking way.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" said the painter, \"that's done all the world over.\"\n\n\"After that,\" continued Georges, \"Ali gave me yataghans, and carbines,\nand scimetars, and what-not. But when we got back to his capital he\nmade me propositions, wanted me to drown a wife, and make a slave of\nmyself,--Orientals are so queer! But I thought I'd had enough of it;\nfor, after all, you know, Ali was a rebel against the Porte. So I\nconcluded I had better get off while I could. But I'll do Monsieur\nTebelen the justice to say that he loaded me with presents,--diamonds,\nten thousand talari, one thousand gold coins, a beautiful Greek girl for\ngroom, a little Circassian for a mistress, and an Arab horse! Yes, Ali\nTebelen, pacha of Janina, is too little known; he needs an historian.\nIt is only in the East one meets with such iron souls, who can nurse a\nvengeance twenty years and accomplish it some fine morning. He had\nthe most magnificent white beard that was ever seen, and a hard, stern\nface--\"\n\n\"But what did you do with your treasures?\" asked farmer Leger.\n\n\"Ha! that's it! you may well ask that! Those fellows down there haven't\nany Grand Livre nor any Bank of France. So I was forced to carry off my\nwindfalls in a felucca, which was captured by the Turkish High-Admiral\nhimself. Such as you see me here to-day, I came very near being impaled\nat Smyrna. Indeed, if it hadn't been for Monsieur de Riviere, our\nambassador, who was there, they'd have taken me for an accomplice of Ali\npacha. I saved my head, but, to tell the honest truth, all the rest,\nthe ten thousand talari, the thousand gold pieces, and the fine weapons,\nwere all, yes all, drunk up by the thirsty treasury of the Turkish\nadmiral. My position was the more perilous because that very admiral\nhappened to be Chosrew pacha. After I routed him, the fellow had managed\nto obtain a position which is equal to that of our Admiral of the\nFleet--\"\n\n\"But I thought he was in the cavalry?\" said Pere Leger, who had followed\nthe narrative with the deepest attention.\n\n\"Dear me! how little the East is understood in the French provinces!\"\ncried Georges. \"Monsieur, I'll explain the Turks to you. You are a\nfarmer; the Padishah (that's the Sultan) makes you a marshal; if you\ndon't fulfil your functions to his satisfaction, so much the worse\nfor you, he cuts your head off; that's his way of dismissing his\nfunctionaries. A gardener is made a prefect; and the prime minister\ncomes down to be a foot-boy. The Ottomans have no system of promotion\nand no hierarchy. From a cavalry officer Chosrew simply became a naval\nofficer. Sultan Mahmoud ordered him to capture Ali by sea; and he did\nget hold of him, assisted by those beggarly English--who put their\npaw on most of the treasure. This Chosrew, who had not forgotten the\nriding-lesson I gave him, recognized me. You understand, my goose\nwas cooked, oh, brown! when it suddenly came into my head to claim\nprotection as a Frenchman and a troubadour from Monsieur de Riviere. The\nambassador, enchanted to find something to show him off, demanded that I\nshould be set at liberty. The Turks have one good trait in their nature;\nthey are as willing to let you go as they are to cut your head off;\nthey are indifferent to everything. The French consul, charming fellow,\nfriend of Chosrew, made him give back two thousand of the talari, and,\nconsequently, his name is, as I may say, graven on my heart--\"\n\n\"What was his name?\" asked Monsieur de Serizy; and a look of some\nsurprise passed over his face as Georges named, correctly, one of our\nmost distinguished consul-generals who happened at that time to be\nstationed at Smyrna.\n\n\"I assisted,\" added Georges, \"at the execution of the Governor of\nSmyrna, whom the Sultan had ordered Chosrew to put to death. It was one\nof the most curious things I ever saw, though I've seen many,--I'll tell\nyou about it when we stop for breakfast. From Smyrna I crossed to Spain,\nhearing there was a revolution there. I went straight to Mina, who\nappointed me as his aide-de-camp with the rank of colonel. I fought for\nthe constitutional cause, which will certainly be defeated when we enter\nSpain--as we undoubtedly shall, some of these days--\"\n\n\"You, a French soldier!\" said the count, sternly. \"You show\nextraordinary confidence in the discretion of those who are listening to\nyou.\"\n\n\"But there are no spies here,\" said Georges.\n\n\"Are you aware, Colonel Georges,\" continued the count, \"that the Court\nof Peers is at this very time inquiring into a conspiracy which has made\nthe government extremely severe in its treatment of French soldiers\nwho bear arms against France, and who deal in foreign intrigues for the\npurpose of overthrowing our legitimate sovereigns.\"\n\nOn hearing this stern admonition the painter turned red to his ears and\nlooked at Mistigris, who seemed dumfounded.\n\n\"Well,\" said Pere Leger, \"what next?\"\n\n\"If,\" continued the count, \"I were a magistrate, it would be my duty to\norder the gendarmes at Pierrefitte to arrest the aide-de-camp of Mina,\nand to summon all present in this vehicle to testify to his words.\"\n\nThis speech stopped Georges' narrative all the more surely, because\nat this moment the coucou reached the guard-house of a brigade of\ngendarmerie,--the white flag floating, as the orthodox saying is, upon\nthe breeze.\n\n\"You have too many decorations to do such a dastardly thing,\" said\nOscar.\n\n\"Never mind; we'll catch up with him soon,\" whispered Georges in the\nlad's ear.\n\n\"Colonel,\" cried Leger, who was a good deal disturbed by the count's\noutburst, and wanted to change the conversation, \"in all these countries\nwhere you have been, what sort of farming do they do? How do they vary\nthe crops?\"\n\n\"Well, in the first place, my good fellow, you must understand, they are\ntoo busy cropping off each others' heads to think much of cropping the\nground.\"\n\nThe count couldn't help smiling; and that smile reassured the narrator.\n\n\"They have a way of cultivating which you will think very queer. They\ndon't cultivate at all; that's their style of farming. The Turks and\nthe Greeks, they eat onions or rise. They get opium from poppies, and\nit gives them a fine revenue. Then they have tobacco, which grows of\nitself, famous latakiah! and dates! and all kinds of sweet things that\ndon't need cultivation. It is a country full of resources and commerce.\nThey make fine rugs at Smyrna, and not dear.\"\n\n\"But,\" persisted Leger, \"if the rugs are made of wool they must come\nfrom sheep; and to have sheep you must have fields, farms, culture--\"\n\n\"Well, there may be something of that sort,\" replied Georges. \"But their\nchief crop, rice, grows in the water. As for me, I have only been along\nthe coasts and seen the parts that are devastated by war. Besides, I\nhave the deepest aversion to statistics.\"\n\n\"How about the taxes?\" asked the farmer.\n\n\"Oh! the taxes are heavy; they take all a man has, and leave him the\nrest. The pacha of Egypt was so struck with the advantages of that\nsystem, that, when I came away he was on the point of organizing his own\nadministration on that footing--\"\n\n\"But,\" said Leger, who no longer understood a single word, \"how?\"\n\n\"How?\" said Georges. \"Why, agents go round and take all the harvests,\nand leave the fellahs just enough to live on. That's a system that does\naway with stamped papers and bureaucracy, the curse of France, hein?\"\n\n\"By virtue of what right?\" said Leger.\n\n\"Right? why it is a land of despotism. They haven't any rights. Don't\nyou know the fine definition Montesquieu gives of despotism. 'Like the\nsavage, it cuts down the tree to gather the fruits.' They don't tax,\nthey take everything.\"\n\n\"And that's what our rulers are trying to bring us to. 'Tax\nvobiscum,'--no, thank you!\" said Mistigris.\n\n\"But that is what we _are_ coming to,\" said the count. \"Therefore, those\nwho own land will do well to sell it. Monsieur Schinner must have seen\nhow things are tending in Italy, where the taxes are enormous.\"\n\n\"Corpo di Bacco! the Pope is laying it on heavily,\" replied Schinner.\n\"But the people are used to it. Besides, Italians are so good-natured\nthat if you let 'em murder a few travellers along the highways they're\ncontented.\"\n\n\"I see, Monsieur Schinner,\" said the count, \"that you are not wearing\nthe decoration you obtained in 1819; it seems the fashion nowadays not\nto wear orders.\"\n\nMistigris and the pretended Schinner blushed to their ears.\n\n\"Well, with me,\" said the artist, \"the case is different. It isn't on\naccount of fashion; but I don't want to be recognized. Have the goodness\nnot to betray me, monsieur; I am supposed to be a little painter of\nno consequence,--a mere decorator. I'm on may way to a chateau where I\nmustn't rouse the slightest suspicion.\"\n\n\"Ah! I see,\" said the count, \"some intrigue,--a love affair! Youth is\nhappy!\"\n\nOscar, who was writhing in his skin at being a nobody and having nothing\nto say, gazed at Colonel Czerni-Georges and at the famous painter\nSchinner, and wondered how he could transform himself into somebody. But\na youth of nineteen, kept at home all his life, and going for two weeks\nonly into the country, what could he be, or do, or say? However, the\nAlicante had got into his head, and his vanity was boiling in his veins;\nso when the famous Schinner allowed a romantic adventure to be guessed\nat in which the danger seemed as great as the pleasure, he fastened his\neyes, sparkling with wrath and envy, upon that hero.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the count, with a credulous air, \"a man must love a woman\nwell to make such sacrifices.\"\n\n\"What sacrifices?\" demanded Mistigris.\n\n\"Don't you know, my little friend, that a ceiling painted by so great a\nmaster as yours is worth its weight in gold?\" replied the count. \"If the\ncivil list paid you, as it did, thirty thousand francs for each of\nthose rooms in the Louvre,\" he continued, addressing Schinner, \"a\nbourgeois,--as you call us in the studios--ought certainly to pay\nyou twenty thousand. Whereas, if you go to this chateau as a humble\ndecorator, you will not get two thousand.\"\n\n\"The money is not the greatest loss,\" said Mistigris. \"The work is\nsure to be a masterpiece, but he can't sign it, you know, for fear of\ncompromising _her_.\"\n\n\"Ah! I'd return all my crosses to the sovereigns who gave them to me for\nthe devotion that youth can win,\" said the count.\n\n\"That's just it!\" said Mistigris, \"when one's young, one's loved; plenty\nof love, plenty of women; but they do say: 'Where there's wife, there's\nmope.'\"\n\n\"What does Madame Schinner say to all this?\" pursued the count; \"for I\nbelieve you married, out of love, the beautiful Adelaide de Rouville,\nthe protegee of old Admiral de Kergarouet; who, by the bye, obtained for\nyou the order for the Louvre ceilings through his nephew, the Comte de\nFontaine.\"\n\n\"A great painter is never married when he travels,\" said Mistigris.\n\n\"So that's the morality of studios, is it?\" cried the count, with an air\nof great simplicity.\n\n\"Is the morality of courts where you got those decorations of yours any\nbetter?\" said Schinner, recovering his self-possession, upset for the\nmoment by finding out how much the count knew of Schinner's life as an\nartist.\n\n\"I never asked for any of my orders,\" said the count. \"I believe I have\nloyally earned them.\"\n\n\"'A fair yield and no flavor,'\" said Mistigris.\n\nThe count was resolved not to betray himself; he assumed an air of\ngood-humored interest in the country, and looked up the valley of\nGroslay as the coucou took the road to Saint-Brice, leaving that to\nChantilly on the right.\n\n\"Is Rome as fine as they say it is?\" said Georges, addressing the great\npainter.\n\n\"Rome is fine only to those who love it; a man must have a passion for\nit to enjoy it. As a city, I prefer Venice,--though I just missed being\nmurdered there.\"\n\n\"Faith, yes!\" cried Mistigris; \"if it hadn't been for me you'd have been\ngobbled up. It was that mischief-making tom-fool, Lord Byron, who\ngot you into the scrape. Oh! wasn't he raging, that buffoon of an\nEnglishman?\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Schinner. \"I don't want my affair with Lord Byron talked\nabout.\"\n\n\"But you must own, all the same, that you were glad enough I knew how to\nbox,\" said Mistigris.\n\nFrom time to time, Pierrotin exchanged sly glances with the count,\nwhich might have made less inexperienced persons than the five other\ntravellers uneasy.\n\n\"Lords, pachas, and thirty-thousand-franc ceilings!\" he cried. \"I seem\nto be driving sovereigns. What pourboires I'll get!\"\n\n\"And all the places paid for!\" said Mistigris, slyly.\n\n\"It is a lucky day for me,\" continued Pierrotin; \"for you know, Pere\nLeger, about my beautiful new coach on which I have paid an advance of\ntwo thousand francs? Well, those dogs of carriage-builders, to whom I\nhave to pay two thousand five hundred francs more, won't take fifteen\nhundred down, and my note for a thousand for two months! Those vultures\nwant it all. Who ever heard of being so stiff with a man in business\nthese eight years, and the father of a family?--making me run the risk\nof losing everything, carriage and money too, if I can't find before\nto-morrow night that miserable last thousand! Hue, Bichette! They won't\nplay that trick on the great coach offices, I'll warrant you.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's it,\" said the rapin; \"'your money or your strife.'\"\n\n\"Well, you have only eight hundred now to get,\" remarked the count,\nwho considered this moan, addressed to Pere Leger, a sort of letter of\ncredit drawn upon himself.\n\n\"True,\" said Pierrotin. \"Xi! xi! Rougeot!\"\n\n\"You must have seen many fine ceilings in Venice,\" resumed the count,\naddressing Schinner.\n\n\"I was too much in love to take any notice of what seemed to me then\nmere trifles,\" replied Schinner. \"But I was soon cured of that folly,\nfor it was in the Venetian states--in Dalmatia--that I received a cruel\nlesson.\"\n\n\"Can it be told?\" asked Georges. \"I know Dalmatia very well.\"\n\n\"Well, if you have been there, you know that all the people at that end\nof the Adriatic are pirates, rovers, corsairs retired from business, as\nthey haven't been hanged--\"\n\n\"Uscoques,\" said Georges.\n\nHearing the right name given, the count, who had been sent by Napoleon\non one occasion to the Illyrian provinces, turned his head and looked at\nGeorges, so surprised was he.\n\n\"The affair happened in that town where they make maraschino,\" continued\nSchinner, seeming to search for a name.\n\n\"Zara,\" said Georges. \"I've been there; it is on the coast.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said the painter. \"I had gone there to look at the\ncountry, for I adore scenery. I've longed a score of times to paint\nlandscape, which no one, as I think, understands but Mistigris, who\nwill some day reproduce Hobbema, Ruysdael, Claude Lorrain, Poussin, and\nothers.\"\n\n\"But,\" exclaimed the count, \"if he reproduces one of them won't that be\nenough?\"\n\n\"If you persist in interrupting, monsieur,\" said Oscar, \"we shall never\nget on.\"\n\n\"And Monsieur Schinner was not addressing himself to you in particular,\"\nadded Georges.\n\n\"'Tisn't polite to interrupt,\" said Mistigris, sententiously, \"but we\nall do it, and conversation would lose a great deal if we didn't scatter\nlittle condiments while exchanging our reflections. Therefore, continue,\nagreeable old gentleman, to lecture us, if you like. It is done in the\nbest society, and you know the proverb: 'we must 'owl with the wolves.'\"\n\n\"I had heard marvellous things of Dalmatia,\" resumed Schinner, \"so I\nwent there, leaving Mistigris in Venice at an inn--\"\n\n\"'Locanda,'\" interposed Mistigris; \"keep to the local color.\"\n\n\"Zara is what is called a country town--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Georges; \"but it is fortified.\"\n\n\"Parbleu!\" said Schinner; \"the fortifications count for much in my\nadventure. At Zara there are a great many apothecaries. I lodged with\none. In foreign countries everybody makes a principal business of\nletting lodgings; all other trades are accessory. In the evening, linen\nchanged, I sat in my balcony. In the opposite balcony I saw a woman; oh!\nsuch a woman! Greek,--_that tells all_! The most beautiful creature in\nthe town; almond eyes, lids that dropped like curtains, lashes like a\npaint-brush, a face with an oval to drive Raffaelle mad, a skin of the\nmost delicious coloring, tints well-blended, velvety! and hands, oh!--\"\n\n\"They weren't made of butter like those of the David school,\" put in\nMistigris.\n\n\"You are always lugging in your painting,\" cried Georges.\n\n\"La, la!\" retorted Mistigris; \"'an ounce o' paint is worth a pound of\nswagger.'\"\n\n\"And such a costume! pure Greek!\" continued Schinner. \"Conflagration of\nsoul! you understand? Well, I questioned my Diafoirus; and he told me\nthat my neighbor was named Zena. Changed my linen. The husband, an old\nvillain, in order to marry Zena, paid three hundred thousand francs to\nher father and mother, so celebrated was the beauty of that beautiful\ncreature, who was truly the most beautiful girl in all Dalmatia,\nIllyria, Adriatica, and other places. In those parts they buy their\nwives without seeing them--\"\n\n\"I shall not go _there_,\" said Pere Leger.\n\n\"There are nights when my sleep is still illuminated by the eyes of\nZena,\" continued Schinner. \"The husband was sixty-nine years of age,\nand jealous! not as a tiger, for they say of a tiger, 'jealous as a\nDalmatian'; and my man was worse than A Dalmatian, one Dalmatian,--he\nwas three and a half Dalmatians at the very least; he was an Uscoque,\ntricoque, archicoque in a bicoque of a paltry little place like Zara--\"\n\n\"Horrid fellow, and 'horrider bellow,'\" put in Mistigris.\n\n\"Ha! good,\" said Georges, laughing.\n\n\"After being a corsair, and probably a pirate, he thought no more\nof spitting a Christian on his dagger than I did of spitting on the\nground,\" continued Schinner. \"So that was how the land lay. The old\nwretch had millions, and was hideous with the loss of an ear some pacha\nhad cut off, and the want of an eye left I don't know where. 'Never,'\nsaid the little Diafoirus, 'never does he leave his wife, never for\na second.' 'Perhaps she'll want your services, and I could go in your\nclothes; that's a trick that has great success in our theatres,' I told\nhim. Well, it would take too long to tell you all the delicious moments\nof that lifetime--to wit, three days--which I passed exchanging looks\nwith Zena, and changing linen every day. It was all the more violently\ntitillating because the slightest motion was significant and dangerous.\nAt last it must have dawned upon Zena's mind that none but a Frenchman\nand an artist was daring enough to make eyes at her in the midst of the\nperils by which she was surrounded; and as she hated her hideous pirate,\nshe answered my glances with delightful ogles fit to raise a man to\nthe summit of Paradise without pulleys. I attained to the height of Don\nQuixote; I rose to exaltation! and I cried: 'The monster may kill me,\nbut I'll go, I'll go!' I gave up landscape and studied the ignoble\ndwelling of the Uscoque. That night, changed linen, and put on the most\nperfumed shirt I had; then I crossed the street, and entered--\"\n\n\"The house?\" cried Oscar.\n\n\"The house?\" echoed Georges.\n\n\"The house,\" said Schinner.\n\n\"Well, you're a bold dog,\" cried farmer Leger. \"I should have kept out\nof it myself.\"\n\n\"Especially as you could never have got through the doorway,\" replied\nSchinner. \"So in I went,\" he resumed, \"and I found two hands stretched\nout to meet mine. I said nothing, for those hands, soft as the peel of\nan onion, enjoined me to silence. A whisper breathed into my ear, 'He\nsleeps!' Then, as we were sure that nobody would see us, we went to\nwalk, Zena and I, upon the ramparts, but accompanied, if you please, by\na duenna, as hideous as an old portress, who didn't leave us any more\nthan our shadow; and I couldn't persuade Madame Pirate to send her away.\nThe next night we did the same thing, and again I wanted to get rid of\nthe old woman, but Zena resisted. As my sweet love spoke only Greek, and\nI Venetian, we couldn't understand each other, and so we quarrelled.\nI said to myself, in changing linen, 'As sure as fate, the next time\nthere'll be no old woman, and we can make it all up with the language of\nlove.' Instead of which, fate willed that that old woman should save\nmy life! You'll hear how. The weather was fine, and, not to create\nsuspicion, I took a turn at landscape,--this was after our quarrel was\nmade up, you understand. After walking along the ramparts for some time,\nI was coming tranquilly home with my hands in my pockets, when I saw the\nstreet crowded with people. Such a crowd! like that for an execution. It\nfell upon me; I was seized, garroted, gagged, and guarded by the police.\nAh! you don't know--and I hope you never may know--what it is to be\ntaken for a murderer by a maddened populace which stones you and howls\nafter you from end to end of the principal street of a town, shouting\nfor your death! Ah! those eyes were so many flames, all mouths were\na single curse, while from the volume of that burning hatred rose the\nfearful cry: 'To death! to death! down with the murderer!'\"\n\n\"So those Dalmatians spoke our language, did they?\" said the count. \"I\nobserve you relate the scene as if it happened yesterday.\"\n\nSchinner was nonplussed.\n\n\"Riot has but one language,\" said the astute statesman Mistigris.\n\n\"Well,\" continued Schinner, \"when I was brought into court in presence\nof the magistrates, I learned that the cursed corsair was dead, poisoned\nby Zena. I'd liked to have changed linen then. Give you my word, I knew\nnothing of _that_ melodrama. It seems the Greek girl put opium (a great\nmany poppies, as monsieur told us, grow about there) in the pirate's\ngrog, just to make him sleep soundly and leave her free for a little\nwalk with me, and the old duenna, unfortunate creature, made a mistake\nand trebled the dose. The immense fortune of that cursed pirate was\nreally the cause of all my Zena's troubles. But she explained matters\nso ingenuously that I, for one, was released with an injunction from the\nmayor and the Austrian commissary of police to go back to Rome. Zena,\nwho let the heirs of the Uscoque and the judges get most of the old\nvillain's wealth, was let off with two years' seclusion in a convent,\nwhere she still is. I am going back there some day to paint her\nportrait; for in a few years, you know, all this will be forgotten. Such\nare the follies one commits at eighteen!\"\n\n\"And you left me without a sou in the locanda at Venice,\" said\nMistigris. \"And I had to get from Venice to Rome by painting portraits\nfor five francs apiece, which they didn't pay me. However, that was my\nhalcyon time. I don't regret it.\"\n\n\"You can imagine the reflections that came to me in that Dalmatian\nprison, thrown there without protection, having to answer to Austrians\nand Dalmatians, and in danger of losing my head because I went twice to\nwalk with a woman. There's ill-luck, with a vengeance!\"\n\n\"Did all that really happen to you?\" said Oscar, naively.\n\n\"Why shouldn't it happen to him, inasmuch as it had already happened\nduring the French occupation of Illyria to one of our most gallant\nofficers of artillery?\" said the count, slyly.\n\n\"And you believed that artillery officer?\" said Mistigris, as slyly to\nthe count.\n\n\"Is that all?\" asked Oscar.\n\n\"Of course he can't tell you that they cut his head off,--how could he?\"\nsaid Mistigris. \"'Dead schinners tell no tales.'\"\n\n\"Monsieur, are there farms in that country?\" asked Pere Leger. \"What do\nthey cultivate?\"\n\n\"Maraschino,\" replied Mistigris,--\"a plant that grows to the height of\nthe lips, and produces a liqueur which goes by that name.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Pere Leger.\n\n\"I only stayed three days in the town and fifteen in prison,\" said\nSchinner, \"so I saw nothing; not even the fields where they grow the\nmaraschino.\"\n\n\"They are fooling you,\" said Georges to the farmer. \"Maraschino comes in\ncases.\"\n\n\"'Romances alter cases,'\" remarked Mistigris.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. THE DRAMA BEGINS\n\n\nPierrotin's vehicle was now going down the steep incline of the valley\nof Saint-Brice to the inn which stands in the middle of the large\nvillage of that name, where Pierrotin was in the habit of stopping an\nhour to breathe his horses, give them their oats, and water them. It was\nnow about half-past one o'clock.\n\n\"Ha! here's Pere Leger,\" cried the inn-keeper, when the coach pulled up\nbefore the door. \"Do you breakfast?\"\n\n\"Always once a day,\" said the fat farmer; \"and I'll break a crust here\nand now.\"\n\n\"Give us a good breakfast,\" cried Georges, twirling his cane in a\ncavalier manner which excited the admiration of poor Oscar.\n\nBut that admiration was turned to jealousy when he saw the gay\nadventurer pull out from a side-pocket a small straw case, from which\nhe selected a light-colored cigar, which he proceeded to smoke on the\nthreshold of the inn door while waiting for breakfast.\n\n\"Do you smoke?\" he asked of Oscar.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" replied the ex-schoolboy, swelling out his little chest and\nassuming a jaunty air.\n\nGeorges presented the open case to Oscar and Schinner.\n\n\"Phew!\" said the great painter; \"ten-sous cigars!\"\n\n\"The remains of those I brought back from Spain,\" said the adventurer.\n\"Do you breakfast here?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the artist. \"I am expected at the chateau. Besides, I took\nsomething at the Lion d'Argent just before starting.\"\n\n\"And you?\" said Georges to Oscar.\n\n\"I have breakfasted,\" replied Oscar.\n\nOscar would have given ten years of his life for boots and straps to his\ntrousers. He sneezed, he coughed, he spat, and swallowed the smoke with\nill-disguised grimaces.\n\n\"You don't know how to smoke,\" said Schinner; \"look at me!\"\n\nWith a motionless face Schinner breathed in the smoke of his cigar\nand let it out through his nose without the slightest contraction of\nfeature. Then he took another whiff, kept the smoke in his throat,\nremoved the cigar from his lips, and allowed the smoke slowly and\ngracefully to escape them.\n\n\"There, young man,\" said the great painter.\n\n\"Here, young man, here's another way; watch this,\" said Georges,\nimitating Schinner, but swallowing the smoke and exhaling none.\n\n\"And my parents believed they had educated me!\" thought Oscar,\nendeavoring to smoke with better grace.\n\nBut his nausea was so strong that he was thankful when Mistigris filched\nhis cigar, remarking, as he smoked it with evident satisfaction, \"You\nhaven't any contagious diseases, I hope.\"\n\nOscar in reply would fain have punched his head.\n\n\"How he does spend money!\" he said, looking at Colonel Georges. \"Eight\nfrancs for Alicante and the cheese-cakes; forty sous for cigars; and his\nbreakfast will cost him--\"\n\n\"Ten francs at least,\" replied Mistigris; \"but that's how things are.\n'Sharp stomachs make short purses.'\"\n\n\"Come, Pere Leger, let us drink a bottle of Bordeaux together,\" said\nGeorges to the farmer.\n\n\"Twenty francs for his breakfast!\" cried Oscar; \"in all, more than\nthirty-odd francs since we started!\"\n\nKilled by a sense of his inferiority, Oscar sat down on a stone post,\nlost in a revery which did not allow him to perceive that his trousers,\ndrawn up by the effect of his position, showed the point of junction\nbetween the old top of his stocking and the new \"footing,\"--his mother's\nhandiwork.\n\n\"We are brothers in socks,\" said Mistigris, pulling up his own trousers\nsufficiently to show an effect of the same kind,--\"'By the footing,\nHercules.'\"\n\nThe count, who overheard this, laughed as he stood with folded arms\nunder the porte-cochere, a little behind the other travellers. However\nnonsensical these lads might be, the grave statesman envied their very\nfollies; he liked their bragging and enjoyed the fun of their lively\nchatter.\n\n\"Well, are you to have Les Moulineaux? for I know you went to Paris to\nget the money for the purchase,\" said the inn-keeper to Pere Leger, whom\nhe had just taken to the stables to see a horse he wanted to sell to\nhim. \"It will be queer if you manage to fleece a peer of France and a\nminister of State like the Comte de Serizy.\"\n\nThe person thus alluded to showed no sign upon his face as he turned to\nlook at the farmer.\n\n\"I've done for him,\" replied Pere Leger, in a low voice.\n\n\"Good! I like to see those nobles fooled. If you should want twenty\nthousand francs or so, I'll lend them to you--But Francois, the\nconductor of Touchard's six o'clock coach, told me that Monsieur\nMargueron was invited by the Comte de Serizy to dine with him to-day at\nPresles.\"\n\n\"That was the plan of his Excellency, but we had our own little ways of\nthwarting it,\" said the farmer, laughing.\n\n\"The count could appoint Monsieur Margueron's son, and you haven't any\nplace to give,--remember that,\" said the inn-keeper.\n\n\"Of course I do; but if the count has the ministry on his side, I have\nKing Louis XVIII.,\" said Pere Leger, in a low voice. \"Forty thousand of\nhis pictures on coin of the realm given to Moreau will enable me to buy\nLes Moulineaux for two hundred and sixty thousand, money down, before\nMonsieur de Serizy can do so. When he finds the sale is made, he'll\nbe glad enough to buy the farm for three hundred and sixty thousand,\ninstead of letting me cut it up in small lots right in the heart of his\nproperty.\"\n\n\"Well done, bourgeois!\" cried the inn-keeper.\n\n\"Don't you think that's good play?\" said Leger.\n\n\"Besides,\" said the inn-keeper, \"the farm is really worth that to him.\"\n\n\"Yes; Les Moulineaux brings in to-day six thousand francs in rental.\nI'll take another lease of it at seven thousand five hundred for\neighteen years. Therefore it is really an investment at more than two\nand a half per cent. The count can't complain of that. In order not to\ninvolve Moreau, he is himself to propose me as tenant and farmer; it\ngives him a look of acting for his master's interests by finding him\nnearly three per cent for his money, and a tenant who will pay well.\"\n\n\"How much will Moreau make, in all?\"\n\n\"Well, if the count gives him ten thousand francs for the transaction\nthe matter will bring him fifty thousand,--and well-earned, too.\"\n\n\"After all, the count, so they tell me, doesn't like Presles. And\nthen he is so rich, what does it matter what it costs him?\" said the\ninn-keeper. \"I have never seen him, myself.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" said Pere Leger. \"But he must be intending to live there,\nor why should he spend two hundred thousand francs in restoring the\nchateau? It is as fine now as the King's own palace.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said the inn-keeper, \"it was high time for Moreau to\nfeather his nest.\"\n\n\"Yes, for if the masters come there,\" replied Leger, \"they won't keep\ntheir eyes in their pockets.\"\n\nThe count lost not a word of this conversation, which was held in a low\nvoice, but not in a whisper.\n\n\"Here I have actually found the proofs I was going down there to seek,\"\nhe thought, looking at the fat farmer as he entered the kitchen. \"But\nperhaps,\" he added, \"it is only a scheme; Moreau may not have listened\nto it.\"\n\nSo unwilling was he to believe that his steward could lend himself to\nsuch a conspiracy.\n\nPierrotin here came out to water his horses. The count, thinking that\nthe driver would probably breakfast with the farmer and the inn-keeper,\nfeared some thoughtless indiscretion.\n\n\"All these people combine against us,\" he thought; \"it is allowable to\nbaffle them--Pierrotin,\" he said in a low voice as the man passed him,\n\"I promised you ten louis to keep my secret; but if you continue to\nconceal my name (and remember, I shall know if you pronounce it, or make\nthe slightest sign that reveals it to any one, no matter who, here or at\nIsle-Adam, before to-night), I will give you to-morrow morning, on your\nreturn trip, the thousand francs you need to pay for your new coach.\nTherefore, by way of precaution,\" added the count, striking Pierrotin,\nwho was pale with happiness, on the shoulder, \"don't go in there to\nbreakfast; stay with your horses.\"\n\n\"Monsieur le comte, I understand you; don't be afraid! it relates to\nPere Leger, of course.\"\n\n\"It relates to every one,\" replied the count.\n\n\"Make yourself easy.--Come, hurry,\" said Pierrotin, a few moments later,\nputting his head into the kitchen. \"We are late. Pere Leger, you know\nthere's a hill to climb; I'm not hungry, and I'll drive on slowly; you\ncan soon overtake me,--it will do you good to walk a bit.\"\n\n\"What a hurry you are in, Pierrotin!\" said the inn-keeper. \"Can't you\nstay and breakfast? The colonel here pays for the wine at fifty sous,\nand has ordered a bottle of champagne.\"\n\n\"I can't. I've got a fish I must deliver by three o'clock for a great\ndinner at Stors; there's no fooling with customers, or fishes, either.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Pere Leger to the inn-keeper. \"You can harness that\nhorse you want to sell me into the cabriolet; we'll breakfast in peace\nand overtake Pierrotin, and I can judge of the beast as we go along. We\ncan go three in your jolter.\"\n\nTo the count's surprise, Pierrotin himself rebridled the horses.\nSchinner and Mistigris had walked on. Scarcely had Pierrotin overtaken\nthe two artists and was mounting the hill from which Ecouen, the steeple\nof Mesnil, and the forests that surround that most beautiful region,\ncame in sight, when the gallop of a horse and the jingling of a vehicle\nannounced the coming of Pere Leger and the grandson of Czerni-Georges,\nwho were soon restored to their places in the coucou.\n\nAs Pierrotin drove down the narrow road to Moisselles, Georges, who had\nso far not ceased to talk with the farmer of the beauty of the hostess\nat Saint-Brice, suddenly exclaimed: \"Upon my word, this landscape is not\nso bad, great painter, is it?\"\n\n\"Pooh! you who have seen the East and Spain can't really admire it.\"\n\n\"I've two cigars left! If no one objects, will you help me finish them,\nSchinner? the little young man there seems to have found a whiff or two\nenough for him.\"\n\nPere Leger and the count kept silence, which passed for consent.\n\nOscar, furious at being called a \"little young man,\" remarked, as the\nother two were lighting their cigars:\n\n\"I am not the aide-de-camp of Mina, monsieur, and I have not yet been to\nthe East, but I shall probably go there. The career to which my family\ndestine me will spare me, I trust, the annoyances of travelling in a\ncoucou before I reach your present age. When I once become a personage I\nshall know how to maintain my station.\"\n\n\"'Et caetera punctum!'\" crowed Mistigris, imitating the hoarse voice\nof a young cock; which made Oscar's deliverance all the more absurd,\nbecause he had just reached the age when the beard sprouts and the voice\nbreaks. \"'What a chit for chat!'\" added the rapin.\n\n\"Your family, young man, destine you to some career, do they?\" said\nGeorges. \"Might I ask what it is?\"\n\n\"Diplomacy,\" replied Oscar.\n\nThree bursts of laughter came from Mistigris, the great painter, and the\nfarmer. The count himself could not help smiling. Georges was perfectly\ngrave.\n\n\"By Allah!\" he exclaimed, \"I see nothing to laugh at in that. Though it\nseems to me, young man, that your respectable mother is, at the present\nmoment, not exactly in the social sphere of an ambassadress. She carried\na handbag worthy of the utmost respect, and wore shoe-strings which--\"\n\n\"My mother, monsieur!\" exclaimed Oscar, in a tone of indignation. \"That\nwas the person in charge of our household.\"\n\n\"'Our household' is a very aristocratic term,\" remarked the count.\n\n\"Kings have households,\" replied Oscar, proudly.\n\nA look from Georges repressed the desire to laugh which took possession\nof everybody; he contrived to make Mistigris and the painter understand\nthat it was necessary to manage Oscar cleverly in order to work this new\nmine of amusement.\n\n\"Monsieur is right,\" said the great Schinner to the count, motioning\ntowards Oscar. \"Well-bred people always talk of their 'households';\nit is only common persons like ourselves who say 'home.' For a man so\ncovered with decorations--\"\n\n\"'Nunc my eye, nunc alii,'\" whispered Mistigris.\n\n\"--you seem to know little of the language of the courts. I ask your\nfuture protection, Excellency,\" added Schinner, turning to Oscar.\n\n\"I congratulate myself on having travelled with three such distinguished\nmen,\" said the count,--\"a painter already famous, a future general, and\na young diplomatist who may some day recover Belgium for France.\"\n\nHaving committed the odious crime of repudiating his mother, Oscar,\nfurious from a sense that his companions were laughing at him, now\nresolved, at any cost, to make them pay attention to him.\n\n\"'All is not gold that glitters,'\" he began, his eyes flaming.\n\n\"That's not it,\" said Mistigris. \"'All is not old that titters.' You'll\nnever get on in diplomacy if you don't know your proverbs better than\nthat.\"\n\n\"I may not know proverbs, but I know my way--\"\n\n\"It must be far,\" said Georges, \"for I saw that person in charge of\nyour household give you provisions enough for an ocean voyage: rolls,\nchocolate--\"\n\n\"A special kind of bread and chocolate, yes, monsieur,\" returned Oscar;\n\"my stomach is much too delicate to digest the victuals of a tavern.\"\n\n\"'Victuals' is a word as delicate and refined as your stomach,\" said\nGeorges.\n\n\"Ah! I like that word 'victuals,'\" cried the great painter.\n\n\"The word is all the fashion in the best society,\" said Mistigris. \"I\nuse it myself at the cafe of the Black Hen.\"\n\n\"Your tutor is, doubtless, some celebrated professor, isn't\nhe?--Monsieur Andrieux of the Academie Francaise, or Monsieur\nRoyer-Collard?\" asked Schinner.\n\n\"My tutor is or was the Abbe Loraux, now vicar of Saint-Sulpice,\"\nreplied Oscar, recollecting the name of the confessor at his school.\n\n\"Well, you were right to take a private tutor,\" said Mistigris. \"'Tuto,\ntutor, celeritus, and jocund.' Of course, you will reward him well, your\nabbe?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly he will be made a bishop some day,\" said Oscar.\n\n\"By your family influence?\" inquired Georges gravely.\n\n\"We shall probably contribute to his rise, for the Abbe Frayssinous is\nconstantly at our house.\"\n\n\"Ah! you know the Abbe Frayssinous?\" asked the count.\n\n\"He is under obligations to my father,\" answered Oscar.\n\n\"Are you on your way to your estate?\" asked Georges.\n\n\"No, monsieur; but I am able to say where I am going, if others are not.\nI am going to the Chateau de Presles, to the Comte de Serizy.\"\n\n\"The devil! are you going to Presles?\" cried Schinner, turning as red as\na cherry.\n\n\"So you know his Excellency the Comte de Serizy?\" said Georges.\n\nPere Leger turned round to look at Oscar with a stupefied air.\n\n\"Is Monsieur de Serizy at Presles?\" he said.\n\n\"Apparently, as I am going there,\" replied Oscar.\n\n\"Do you often see the count,\" asked Monsieur de Serizy.\n\n\"Often,\" replied Oscar. \"I am a comrade of his son, who is about my age,\nnineteen; we ride together on horseback nearly every day.\"\n\n\"'Aut Caesar, aut Serizy,'\" said Mistigris, sententiously.\n\nPierrotin and Pere Leger exchanged winks on hearing this statement.\n\n\"Really,\" said the count to Oscar, \"I am delighted to meet with a young\nman who can tell me about that personage. I want his influence on a\nrather serious matter, although it would cost him nothing to oblige me.\nIt concerns a claim I wish to press on the American government. I should\nbe glad to obtain information about Monsieur de Serizy.\"\n\n\"Oh! if you want to succeed,\" replied Oscar, with a knowing look, \"don't\ngo to him, but go to his wife; he is madly in love with her; no one\nknows more than I do about that; but she can't endure him.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said Georges.\n\n\"The count has a skin disease which makes him hideous. Doctor Albert has\ntried in vain to cure it. The count would give half his fortune if he\nhad a chest like mine,\" said Oscar, swelling himself out. \"He lives\na lonely life in his own house; gets up very early in the morning\nand works from three to eight o'clock; after eight he takes his\nremedies,--sulphur-baths, steam-baths, and such things. His valet bakes\nhim in a sort of iron box--for he is always in hopes of getting cured.\"\n\n\"If he is such a friend of the King as they say he is, why doesn't he\nget his Majesty to touch him?\" asked Georges.\n\n\"The count has lately promised thirty thousand francs to a celebrated\nScotch doctor who is coming over to treat him,\" continued Oscar.\n\n\"Then his wife can't be blamed if she finds better--\" said Schinner, but\nhe did not finish his sentence.\n\n\"I should say so!\" resumed Oscar. \"The poor man is so shrivelled and old\nyou would take him for eighty! He's as dry as parchment, and, unluckily\nfor him, he feels his position.\"\n\n\"Most men would,\" said Pere Leger.\n\n\"He adores his wife and dares not find fault with her,\" pursued Oscar,\nrejoicing to have found a topic to which they listened. \"He plays scenes\nwith her which would make you die of laughing,--exactly like Arnolphe in\nMoliere's comedy.\"\n\nThe count, horror-stricken, looked at Pierrotin, who, finding that the\ncount said nothing, concluded that Madame Clapart's son was telling\nfalsehoods.\n\n\"So, monsieur,\" continued Oscar, \"if you want the count's influence, I\nadvise you to apply to the Marquis d'Aiglemont. If you get that former\nadorer of Madame de Serizy on your side, you will win husband and wife\nat one stroke.\"\n\n\"Look here!\" said the painter, \"you seem to have seen the count without\nhis clothes; are you his valet?\"\n\n\"His valet!\" cried Oscar.\n\n\"Hang it! people don't tell such things about their friends in public\nconveyances,\" exclaimed Mistigris. \"As for me, I'm not listening to you;\nI'm deaf: 'discretion plays the better part of adder.'\"\n\n\"'A poet is nasty and not fit,' and so is a tale-bearer,\" cried\nSchinner.\n\n\"Great painter,\" said Georges, sententiously, \"learn this: you can't\nsay harm of people you don't know. Now the little one here has proved,\nindubitably, that he knows his Serizy by heart. If he had told us about\nthe countess, perhaps--?\"\n\n\"Stop! not a word about the Comtesse de Serizy, young men,\" cried the\ncount. \"I am a friend of her brother, the Marquis de Ronquerolles, and\nwhoever attempts to speak disparagingly of the countess must answer to\nme.\"\n\n\"Monsieur is right,\" cried the painter; \"no man should blaguer women.\"\n\n\"God, Honor, and the Ladies! I believe in that melodrama,\" said\nMistigris.\n\n\"I don't know the guerrilla chieftain, Mina, but I know the Keeper of\nthe Seals,\" continued the count, looking at Georges; \"and though I don't\nwear my decorations,\" he added, looking at the painter, \"I prevent those\nwho do not deserve them from obtaining any. And finally, let me say that\nI know so many persons that I even know Monsieur Grindot, the architect\nof Presles. Pierrotin, stop at the next inn; I want to get out a\nmoment.\"\n\nPierrotin hurried his horses through the village street of Moisselles,\nat the end of which was the inn where all travellers stopped. This short\ndistance was done in silence.\n\n\"Where is that young fool going?\" asked the count, drawing Pierrotin\ninto the inn-yard.\n\n\"To your steward. He is the son of a poor lady who lives in the rue de\nla Cerisaie, to whom I often carry fruit, and game, and poultry from\nPresles. She is a Madame Husson.\"\n\n\"Who is that man?\" inquired Pere Leger of Pierrotin when the count had\nleft him.\n\n\"Faith, I don't know,\" replied Pierrotin; \"this is the first time I\nhave driven him. I shouldn't be surprised if he was that prince who owns\nMaffliers. He has just told me to leave him on the road near there; he\ndoesn't want to go on to Isle-Adam.\"\n\n\"Pierrotin thinks he is the master of Maffliers,\" said Pere Leger,\naddressing Georges when he got back into the coach.\n\nThe three young fellows were now as dull as thieves caught in the act;\nthey dared not look at each other, and were evidently considering the\nconsequences of their fibs.\n\n\"This is what is called 'suffering for license sake,'\" said Mistigris.\n\n\"You see I did know the count,\" said Oscar.\n\n\"Possibly. But you'll never be an ambassador,\" replied Georges. \"When\npeople want to talk in public conveyances, they ought to be careful,\nlike me, to talk without saying anything.\"\n\n\"That's what speech is for,\" remarked Mistigris, by way of conclusion.\n\nThe count returned to his seat and the coucou rolled on amid the deepest\nsilence.\n\n\"Well, my friends,\" said the count, when they reached the Carreau woods,\n\"here we all are, as silent as if we were going to the scaffold.\"\n\n\"'Silence gives content,'\" muttered Mistigris.\n\n\"The weather is fine,\" said Georges.\n\n\"What place is that?\" said Oscar, pointing to the chateau de\nFranconville, which produces a fine effect at that particular spot,\nbacked, as it is, by the noble forest of Saint-Martin.\n\n\"How is it,\" cried the count, \"that you, who say you go so often to\nPresles, do not know Franconville?\"\n\n\"Monsieur knows men, not castles,\" said Mistigris.\n\n\"Budding diplomatists have so much else to take their minds,\" remarked\nGeorges.\n\n\"Be so good as to remember my name,\" replied Oscar, furious. \"I am Oscar\nHusson, and ten years hence I shall be famous.\"\n\nAfter that speech, uttered with bombastic assumption, Oscar flung\nhimself back in his corner.\n\n\"Husson of what, of where?\" asked Mistigris.\n\n\"It is a great family,\" replied the count. \"Husson de la Cerisaie;\nmonsieur was born beneath the steps of the Imperial throne.\"\n\nOscar colored crimson to the roots of his hair, and was penetrated\nthrough and through with a dreadful foreboding.\n\nThey were now about to descend the steep hill of La Cave, at the foot of\nwhich, in a narrow valley, flanked by the forest of Saint-Martin, stands\nthe magnificent chateau of Presles.\n\n\"Messieurs,\" said the count, \"I wish you every good fortune in your\nvarious careers. Monsieur le colonel, make your peace with the King\nof France; the Czerni-Georges ought not to snub the Bourbons. I have\nnothing to wish for you, my dear Monsieur Schinner; your fame is already\nwon, and nobly won by splendid work. But you are much to be feared in\ndomestic life, and I, being a married man, dare not invite you to my\nhouse. As for Monsieur Husson, he needs no protection; he possesses the\nsecrets of statesmen and can make them tremble. Monsieur Leger is about\nto pluck the Comte de Serizy, and I can only exhort him to do it with a\nfirm hand. Pierrotin, put me out here, and pick me up at the same place\nto-morrow,\" added the count, who then left the coach and took a path\nthrough the woods, leaving his late companions confused and bewildered.\n\n\"He must be that count who has hired Franconville; that's the path to\nit,\" said Leger.\n\n\"If ever again,\" said the false Schinner, \"I am caught blague-ing in\na public coach, I'll fight a duel with myself. It was your fault,\nMistigris,\" giving his rapin a tap on the head.\n\n\"All I did was to help you out, and follow you to Venice,\" said\nMistigris; \"but that's always the way, 'Fortune belabors the slave.'\"\n\n\"Let me tell you,\" said Georges to his neighbor Oscar, \"that if, by\nchance, that was the Comte de Serizy, I wouldn't be in your skin for a\ngood deal, healthy as you think it.\"\n\nOscar, remembering his mother's injunctions, which these words recalled\nto his mind, turned pale and came to his senses.\n\n\"Here you are, messieurs!\" cried Pierrotin, pulling up at a fine iron\ngate.\n\n\"Here we are--where?\" said the painter, and Georges, and Oscar all at\nonce.\n\n\"Well, well!\" exclaimed Pierrotin, \"if that doesn't beat all! Ah ca,\nmonsieurs, have none of you been here before? Why, this is the chateau\nde Presles.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; all right, friend,\" said Georges, recovering his audacity.\n\"But I happen to be going on to Les Moulineaux,\" he added, not wishing\nhis companions to know that he was really going to the chateau.\n\n\"You don't say so? Then you are coming to me,\" said Pere Leger.\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Why, I'm the farmer at Moulineaux. Hey, colonel, what brings you\nthere?\"\n\n\"To taste your butter,\" said Georges, pulling out his portfolio.\n\n\"Pierrotin,\" said Oscar, \"leave my things at the steward's. I am going\nstraight to the chateau.\"\n\nWhereupon Oscar plunged into a narrow path, not knowing, in the least,\nwhere he was going.\n\n\"Hi! Monsieur l'ambassadeur,\" cried Pere Leger, \"that's the way to the\nforest; if you really want to get to the chateau, go through the little\ngate.\"\n\nThus compelled to enter, Oscar disappeared into the grand court-yard.\nWhile Pere Leger stood watching Oscar, Georges, utterly confounded\nby the discovery that the farmer was the present occupant of Les\nMoulineaux, has slipped away so adroitly that when the fat countryman\nlooked round for his colonel there was no sign of him.\n\nThe iron gates opened at Pierrotin's demand, and he proudly drove in to\ndeposit with the concierge the thousand and one utensils belonging to\nthe great Schinner. Oscar was thunderstruck when he became aware that\nMistigris and his master, the witnesses of his bravado, were to be\ninstalled in the chateau itself. In ten minutes Pierrotin had discharged\nthe various packages of the painter, the bundles of Oscar Husson, and\nthe pretty little leather portmanteau, which he took from its nest of\nhay and confided mysteriously to the wife of the concierge. Then he\ndrove out of the courtyard, cracking his whip, and took the road that\nled through the forest to Isle-Adam, his face beaming with the sly\nexpression of a peasant who calculates his profits. Nothing was lacking\nnow to his happiness; on the morrow he would have his thousand francs,\nand, as a consequence, his magnificent new coach.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. THE MOREAU INTERIOR\n\n\nOscar, somewhat abashed, was skulking behind a clump of trees in the\ncentre of the court-yard, and watching to see what became of his two\nroad-companions, when Monsieur Moreau suddenly came out upon the portico\nfrom what was called the guard-room. He was dressed in a long blue\novercoat which came to his heels, breeches of yellowish leather and\ntop-boots, and in his hand he carried a riding-whip.\n\n\"Ah! my boy, so here you are? How is the dear mamma?\" he said, taking\nOscar by the hand. \"Good-day, messieurs,\" he added to Mistigris and his\nmaster, who then came forward. \"You are, no doubt, the two painters whom\nMonsieur Grindot, the architect, told me to expect.\"\n\nHe whistled twice at the end of his whip; the concierge came.\n\n\"Take these gentlemen to rooms 14 and 15. Madame Moreau will give you\nthe keys. Go with them to show the way; make fires there, if necessary,\nand take up all their things. I have orders from Monsieur le comte,\"\nhe added, addressing the two young men, \"to invite you to my table,\nmessieurs; we dine at five, as in Paris. If you like hunting, you will\nfind plenty to amuse you; I have a license from the Eaux et Forets;\nand we hunt over twelve thousand acres of forest, not counting our own\ndomain.\"\n\nOscar, the painter, and Mistigris, all more or less subdued, exchanged\nglances, but Mistigris, faithful to himself, remarked in a low tone,\n\"'Veni, vidi, cecidi,--I came, I saw, I slaughtered.'\"\n\nOscar followed the steward, who led him along at a rapid pace through\nthe park.\n\n\"Jacques,\" said Moreau to one of his children whom they met, \"run in and\ntell your mother that little Husson has come, and say to her that I am\nobliged to go to Les Moulineaux for a moment.\"\n\nThe steward, then about fifty years old, was a dark man of medium\nheight, and seemed stern. His bilious complexion, to which country\nhabits had added a certain violent coloring, conveyed, at first sight,\nthe impression of a nature which was other than his own. His blue\neyes and a large crow-beaked nose gave him an air that was the more\nthreatening because his eyes were placed too close together. But his\nlarge lips, the outline of his face, and the easy good-humor of his\nmanner soon showed that his nature was a kindly one. Abrupt in speech\nand decided in tone, he impressed Oscar immensely by the force of his\npenetration, inspired, no doubt, by the affection which he felt for the\nboy. Trained by his mother to magnify the steward, Oscar had always felt\nhimself very small in Moreau's presence; but on reaching Presles a new\nsensation came over him, as if he expected some harm from this fatherly\nfigure, his only protector.\n\n\"Well, my Oscar, you don't look pleased at getting here,\" said the\nsteward. \"And yet you'll find plenty of amusement; you shall learn to\nride on horseback, and shoot, and hunt.\"\n\n\"I don't know any of those things,\" said Oscar, stupidly.\n\n\"But I brought you here to learn them.\"\n\n\"Mamma told me only to stay two weeks because of Madame Moreau.\"\n\n\"Oh! we'll see about that,\" replied Moreau, rather wounded that his\nconjugal authority was doubted.\n\nMoreau's youngest son, an active, strapping lad of twelve, here ran up.\n\n\"Come,\" said his father, \"take Oscar to your mother.\"\n\nHe himself went rapidly along the shortest path to the gamekeeper's\nhouse, which was situated between the park and the forest.\n\nThe pavilion, or lodge, in which the count had established his steward,\nwas built a few years before the Revolution. It stood in the centre of\na large garden, one wall of which adjoined the court-yard of the stables\nand offices of the chateau itself. Formerly its chief entrance was on\nthe main road to the village. But after the count's father bought the\nbuilding, he closed that entrance and united the place with his own\nproperty.\n\nThe house, built of freestone, in the style of the period of Louis XV.\n(it is enough to say that its exterior decoration consisted of a stone\ndrapery beneath the windows, as in the colonnades of the Place Louis\nXV., the flutings of which were stiff and ungainly), had on the\nground-floor a fine salon opening into a bedroom, and a dining-room\nconnected with a billiard-room. These rooms, lying parallel to one\nanother, were separated by a staircase, in front of which was a sort of\nperistyle which formed an entrance-hall, on which the two suits of rooms\non either side opened. The kitchen was beneath the dining-room, for the\nwhole building was raised ten steps from the ground level.\n\nBy placing her own bedroom on the first floor above the ground-floor,\nMadame Moreau was able to transform the chamber adjoining the salon into\na boudoir. These two rooms were richly furnished with beautiful pieces\nculled from the rare old furniture of the chateau. The salon, hung\nwith blue and white damask, formerly the curtains of the state-bed, was\ndraped with ample portieres and window curtains lined with white silk.\nPictures, evidently from old panels, plant-stands, various pretty\narticles of modern upholstery, handsome lamps, and a rare old cut-glass\nchandelier, gave a grandiose appearance to the room. The carpet was a\nPersian rug. The boudoir, wholly modern, and furnished entirely after\nMadame Moreau's own taste, was arranged in imitation of a tent, with\nropes of blue silk on a gray background. The classic divan was there, of\ncourse, with its pillows and footstools. The plant-stands, taken care of\nby the head-gardener of Presles, rejoiced the eye with their pyramids of\nbloom. The dining-room and billiard-room were furnished in mahogany.\n\nAround the house the steward's wife had laid out a beautiful garden,\ncarefully cultivated, which opened into the great park. Groups of choice\nparks hid the offices and stables. To improve the entrance by which\nvisitors came to see her, she had substituted a handsome iron gateway\nfor the shabby railing, which she discarded.\n\nThe dependence in which the situation of their dwelling placed the\nMoreaus, was thus adroitly concealed, and they seemed all the more like\nrich and independent persons taking care of the property of a friend,\nbecause neither the count nor the countess ever came to Presles to take\ndown their pretensions. Moreover, the perquisites granted by Monsieur de\nSerizy allowed them to live in the midst of that abundance which is\nthe luxury of country life. Milk, eggs, poultry, game, fruits, flowers,\nforage, vegetables, wood, the steward and his wife used in profusion,\nbuying absolutely nothing but butcher's-meat, wines, and the colonial\nsupplies required by their life of luxury. The poultry-maid baked their\nbread; and of late years Moreau had paid his butcher with pigs from the\nfarm, after reserving those he needed for his own use.\n\nOn one occasion, the countess, always kind and good to her former maid,\ngave her, as a souvenir perhaps, a little travelling-carriage, the\nfashion of which was out of date. Moreau had it repainted, and now drove\nhis wife about the country with two good horses which belonged to the\nfarm. Besides these horses, Moreau had his own saddle-horse. He did\nenough farming on the count's property to keep the horses and maintain\nhis servants. He stacked three hundred tons of excellent hay, but\naccounted for only one hundred, making use of a vague permission once\ngranted by the count. He kept his poultry-yard, pigeon-cotes, and cattle\nat the cost of the estate, but the manure of the stables was used by\nthe count's gardeners. All these little stealings had some ostensible\nexcuse.\n\nMadame Moreau had taken into her service a daughter of one of the\ngardeners, who was first her maid and afterwards her cook. The\npoultry-game, also the dairy-maid, assisted in the work of the\nhousehold; and the steward had hired a discharged soldier to groom the\nhorses and do the heavy labor.\n\nAt Nerville, Chaumont, Maffliers, Nointel, and other places of the\nneighborhood, the handsome wife of the steward was received by\npersons who either did not know, or pretended not to know her previous\ncondition. Moreau did services to many persons. He induced his master to\nagree to certain things which seem trifles in Paris, but are really of\nimmense importance in the country. After bringing about the appointment\nof a certain \"juge de paix\" at Beaumont and also at Isle-Adam, he had,\nin the same year, prevented the dismissal of a keeper-general of the\nForests, and obtained the cross of the Legion of honor for the first\ncavalry-sergeant at Beaumont. Consequently, no festivity was ever given\namong the bourgeoisie to which Monsieur and Madame Moreau were not\ninvited. The rector of Presles and the mayor of Presles came every\nevening to play cards with them. It is difficult for a man not to be\nkind and hospitable after feathering his nest so comfortably.\n\nA pretty woman, and an affected one, as all retired waiting-maids\nof great ladies are, for after they are married they imitate their\nmistresses, Madame Moreau imported from Paris all the new fashions. She\nwore expensive boots, and never was seen on foot, except, occasionally,\nin the finest weather. Though her husband allowed but five hundred\nfrancs a year for her toilet, that sum is immense in the provinces,\nespecially if well laid out. So that Madame Moreau, fair, rosy, and\nfresh, about thirty-six years of age, still slender and delicate in\nshape in spite of her three children, played the young girl and gave\nherself the airs of a princess. If, when she drove by in her caleche,\nsome stranger had asked, \"Who is she?\" Madame Moreau would have been\nfurious had she heard the reply: \"The wife of the steward at Presles.\"\nShe wished to be taken for the mistress of the chateau. In the villages,\nshe patronized the people in the tone of a great lady. The influence of\nher husband over the count, proved in so many years, prevented the small\nbourgeoisie from laughing at Madame Moreau, who, in the eyes of the\npeasants, was really a personage.\n\nEstelle (her name was Estelle) took no more part in the affairs of the\nstewardship then the wife of a broker does in her husband's affairs at\nthe Bourse. She even depended on Moreau for the care of the household\nand their own fortune. Confident of his _means_, she was a thousand\nleagues from dreaming that this comfortable existence, which had lasted\nfor seventeen years, could ever be endangered. And yet, when she heard\nof the count's determination to restore the magnificent chateau, she\nfelt that her enjoyments were threatened, and she urged her husband to\ncome to the arrangement with Leger about Les Moulineaux, so that they\nmight retire from Presles and live at Isle-Adam. She had no intention\nof returning to a position that was more or less that of a servant in\npresence of her former mistress, who, indeed, would have laughed to see\nher established in the lodge with all the airs and graces of a woman of\nthe world.\n\nThe rancorous enmity which existed between the Reyberts and the Moreaus\ncame from a wound inflicted by Madame de Reybert upon Madame Moreau on\nthe first occasion when the latter assumed precedence over the former on\nher first arrival at Presles, the wife of the steward being determined\nnot to allow her supremacy to be undermined by a woman nee de Corroy.\nMadame de Reybert thereupon reminded, or, perhaps, informed the whole\ncountry-side of Madame Moreau's former station. The words \"waiting-maid\"\nflew from lip to lip. The envious acquaintances of the Moreaus\nthroughout the neighborhood from Beaumont to Moisselles, began to carp\nand criticize with such eagerness that a few sparks of the conflagration\nfell into the Moreau household. For four years the Reyberts, cut dead\nby the handsome Estelle, found themselves the objects of so much\nanimadversion on the part of the adherents of the Moreaus that their\nposition at Presles would not have been endurable without the thought of\nvengeance which had, so far, supported them.\n\nThe Moreaus, who were very friendly with Grindot the architect, had\nreceived notice from him of the early arrival of the two painters sent\ndown to finish the decorations of the chateau, the principal paintings\nfor which were just completed by Schinner. The great painter had\nrecommended for this work the artist who was accompanied by Mistigris.\nFor two days past Madame Moreau had been on the tiptoe of expectation,\nand had put herself under arms to receive him. An artist, who was to be\nher guest and companion for weeks, demanded some effort. Schinner and\nhis wife had their own apartment at the chateau, where, by the count's\nexpress orders, they were treated with all the consideration due to\nhimself. Grindot, who stayed at the steward's house, showed such respect\nfor the great artist that neither the steward nor his wife had attempted\nto put themselves on familiar terms with him. Moreover, the noblest and\nrichest people in the surrounding country had vied with each other in\npaying attention to Schinner and his wife. So, very well pleased\nto have, as it were, a little revenge of her own, Madame Moreau was\ndetermined to cry up the artist she was now expecting, and to present\nhim to her social circle as equal in talent to the great Schinner.\n\nThough for two days past Moreau's pretty wife had arrayed herself\ncoquettishly, the prettiest of her toilets had been reserved for this\nvery Saturday, when, as she felt no doubt, the artist would arrive for\ndinner. A pink gown in very narrow stripes, a pink belt with a richly\nchased gold buckle, a velvet ribbon and cross at her throat, and velvet\nbracelets on her bare arms (Madame de Serizy had handsome arms and\nshowed them much), together with bronze kid shoes and thread stockings,\ngave Madame Moreau all the appearance of an elegant Parisian. She wore,\nalso, a superb bonnet of Leghorn straw, trimmed with a bunch of moss\nroses from Nattier's, beneath the spreading sides of which rippled the\ncurls of her beautiful blond hair.\n\nAfter ordering a very choice dinner and reviewing the condition of her\nrooms, she walked about the grounds, so as to be seen standing near a\nflower-bed in the court-yard of the chateau, like the mistress of the\nhouse, on the arrival of the coach from Paris. She held above her head a\ncharming rose-colored parasol lined with white silk and fringed.\nSeeing that Pierrotin merely left Mistigris's queer packages with the\nconcierge, having, apparently, brought no passengers, Estelle retired\ndisappointed and regretting the trouble of making her useless toilet.\nLike many persons who are dressed in their best, she felt incapable of\nany other occupation than that of sitting idly in her salon awaiting the\ncoach from Beaumont, which usually passed about an hour after that\nof Pierrotin, though it did not leave Paris till mid-day. She was,\ntherefore, in her own apartment when the two artists walked up to the\nchateau, and were sent by Moreau himself to their rooms where they made\ntheir regulation toilet for dinner. The pair had asked questions of\ntheir guide, the gardener, who told them so much of Moreau's beauty that\nthey felt the necessity of \"rigging themselves up\" (studio slang). They,\ntherefore, put on their most superlative suits and then walked over to\nthe steward's lodge, piloted by Jacques Moreau, the eldest son, a\nhardy youth, dressed like an English boy in a handsome jacket with a\nturned-over collar, who was spending his vacation like a fish in water\non the estate where his father and mother reigned as aristocrats.\n\n\"Mamma,\" he said, \"here are the two artists sent down by Monsieur\nSchinner.\"\n\nMadame Moreau, agreeably surprised, rose, told her son to place chairs,\nand began to display her graces.\n\n\"Mamma, the Husson boy is with papa,\" added the lad; \"shall I fetch\nhim?\"\n\n\"You need not hurry; go and play with him,\" said his mother.\n\nThe remark \"you need not hurry\" proved to the two artists the\nunimportance of their late travelling companion in the eyes of their\nhostess; but it also showed, what they did not know, the feeling of a\nstep-mother against a step-son. Madame Moreau, after seventeen years\nof married life, could not be ignorant of the steward's attachment to\nMadame Clapart and the little Husson, and she hated both mother and\nchild so vehemently that it is not surprising that Moreau had never\nbefore risked bringing Oscar to Presles.\n\n\"We are requested, my husband and myself,\" she said to the two artists,\n\"to do you the honors of the chateau. We both love art, and, above all,\nartists,\" she added in a mincing tone; \"and I beg you to make yourselves\nat home here. In the country, you know, every one should be at their\nease; one must feel wholly at liberty, or life is _too_ insipid. We have\nalready had Monsieur Schinner with us.\"\n\nMistigris gave a sly glance at his companion.\n\n\"You know him, of course?\" continued Estelle, after a slight pause.\n\n\"Who does not know him, madame?\" said the painter.\n\n\"Knows him like his double,\" remarked Mistigris.\n\n\"Monsieur Grindot told me your name,\" said Madame Moreau to the painter.\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Joseph Bridau,\" he replied, wondering with what sort of woman he had to\ndo.\n\nMistigris began to rebel internally against the patronizing manner of\nthe steward's wife; but he waited, like Bridau, for some word which\nmight give him his cue; one of those words \"de singe a dauphin\" which\nartists, cruel, born-observers of the ridiculous--the pabulum of their\npencils--seize with such avidity. Meantime Estelle's clumsy hands and\nfeet struck their eyes, and presently a word, or phrase or two, betrayed\nher past, and quite out of keeping with the elegance of her dress, made\nthe two young fellows aware of their prey. A single glance at each other\nwas enough to arrange a scheme that they should take Estelle seriously\non her own ground, and thus find amusement enough during the time of\ntheir stay.\n\n\"You say you love art, madame; perhaps you cultivate it successfully,\"\nsaid Joseph Bridau.\n\n\"No. Without being neglected, my education was purely commercial; but\nI have so profound and delicate a sense of art that Monsieur Schinner\nalways asked me, when he had finished a piece of work, to give him my\nopinion on it.\"\n\n\"Just as Moliere consulted La Foret,\" said Mistigris.\n\nNot knowing that La Foret was Moliere's servant-woman, Madame Moreau\ninclined her head graciously, showing that in her ignorance she accepted\nthe speech as a compliment.\n\n\"Didn't he propose to 'croquer' you?\" asked Bridau. \"Painters are eager\nenough after handsome women.\"\n\n\"What may you mean by such language?\"\n\n\"In the studios we say croquer, craunch, nibble, for sketching,\"\ninterposed Mistigris, with an insinuating air, \"and we are always\nwanting to croquer beautiful heads. That's the origin of the expression,\n'She is pretty enough to eat.'\"\n\n\"I was not aware of the origin of the term,\" she replied, with the\nsweetest glance at Mistigris.\n\n\"My pupil here,\" said Bridau, \"Monsieur Leon de Lora, shows a remarkable\ntalent for portraiture. He would be too happy, I know, to leave you a\nsouvenir of our stay by painting your charming head, madame.\"\n\nJoseph Bridau made a sign to Mistigris which meant: \"Come, sail in, and\npush the matter; she is not so bad in looks, this woman.\"\n\nAccepting the glance, Leon de Lora slid down upon the sofa beside\nEstelle and took her hand, which she permitted.\n\n\"Oh! madame, if you would like to offer a surprise to your husband, and\nwill give me a few secret sittings I would endeavor to surpass myself.\nYou are so beautiful, so fresh, so charming! A man without any talent\nmight become a genius in painting you. He would draw from your eyes--\"\n\n\"We must paint your dear children in the arabesques,\" said Bridau,\ninterrupting Mistigris.\n\n\"I would rather have them in the salon; but perhaps I am indiscreet in\nasking it,\" she replied, looking at Bridau coquettishly.\n\n\"Beauty, madame, is a sovereign whom all painters worship; it has\nunlimited claims upon them.\"\n\n\"They are both charming,\" thought Madame Moreau. \"Do you enjoy driving?\nShall I take you through the woods, after dinner, in my carriage?\"\n\n\"Oh! oh! oh!\" cried Mistigris, in three ecstatic tones. \"Why, Presles\nwill prove our terrestrial paradise.\"\n\n\"With an Eve, a fair, young, fascinating woman,\" added Bridau.\n\nJust as Madame Moreau was bridling, and soaring to the seventh heaven,\nshe was recalled like a kite by a twitch at its line.\n\n\"Madame!\" cried her maid-servant, bursting into the room.\n\n\"Rosalie,\" said her mistress, \"who allowed you to come here without\nbeing sent for?\"\n\nRosalie paid no heed to the rebuke, but whispered in her mistress's\near:--\n\n\"The count is at the chateau.\"\n\n\"Has he asked for me?\" said the steward's wife.\n\n\"No, madame; but he wants his trunk and the key of his apartment.\"\n\n\"Then give them to him,\" she replied, making an impatient gesture to\nhide her real trouble.\n\n\"Mamma! here's Oscar Husson,\" said her youngest son, bringing in Oscar,\nwho turned as red as a poppy on seeing the two artists in evening dress.\n\n\"Oh! so you have come, my little Oscar,\" said Estelle, stiffly. \"I\nhope you will now go and dress,\" she added, after looking at him\ncontemptuously from head to foot. \"Your mother, I presume, has not\naccustomed you to dine in such clothes as those.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried the cruel Mistigris, \"a future diplomatist knows the saying\nthat 'two coats are better than none.'\"\n\n\"How do you mean, a future diplomatist?\" exclaimed Madame Moreau.\n\nPoor Oscar had tears in his eyes as he looked in turn from Joseph to\nLeon.\n\n\"Merely a joke made in travelling,\" replied Joseph, who wanted to save\nOscar's feelings out of pity.\n\n\"The boy just wanted to be funny like the rest of us, and he blagued,\nthat's all,\" said Mistigris.\n\n\"Madame,\" said Rosalie, returning to the door of the salon, \"his\nExcellency has ordered dinner for eight, and wants it served at six\no'clock. What are we to do?\"\n\nDuring Estelle's conference with her head-woman the two artists\nand Oscar looked at each other in consternation; their glances were\nexpressive of terrible apprehension.\n\n\"His Excellency! who is he?\" said Joseph Bridau.\n\n\"Why, Monsieur le Comte de Serizy, of course,\" replied little Moreau.\n\n\"Could it have been the count in the coucou?\" said Leon de Lora.\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Oscar, \"the Comte de Serizy always travels in his own\ncarriage with four horses.\"\n\n\"How did the Comte de Serizy get here?\" said the painter to Madame\nMoreau, when she returned, much discomfited, to the salon.\n\n\"I am sure I do not know,\" she said. \"I cannot explain to myself this\nsudden arrival; nor do I know what has brought him--And Moreau not\nhere!\"\n\n\"His Excellency wishes Monsieur Schinner to come over to the chateau,\"\nsaid the gardener, coming to the door of the salon. \"And he begs\nMonsieur Schinner to give him the pleasure to dine with him; also\nMonsieur Mistigris.\"\n\n\"Done for!\" cried the rapin, laughing. \"He whom we took for a bourgeois\nin the coucou was the count. You may well say: 'Sour are the curses of\nperversity.'\"\n\nOscar was very nearly changed to a pillar of salt; for, at this\nrevelation, his throat felt saltier than the sea.\n\n\"And you, who talked to him about his wife's lovers and his skin\ndiseases!\" said Mistigris, turning on Oscar.\n\n\"What does he mean?\" exclaimed the steward's wife, gazing after the two\nartists, who went away laughing at the expression of Oscar's face.\n\nOscar remained dumb, confounded, stupefied, hearing nothing, though\nMadame Moreau questioned him and shook him violently by his arm, which\nshe caught and squeezed. She gained nothing, however, and was forced to\nleave him in the salon without an answer, for Rosalie appeared again, to\nask for linen and silver, and to beg she would go herself and see that\nthe multiplied orders of the count were executed. All the household,\ntogether with the gardeners and the concierge and his wife, were going\nand coming in a confusion that may readily be imagined. The master had\nfallen upon his own house like a bombshell.\n\nFrom the top of the hill near La Cave, where he left the coach, the\ncount had gone, by the path through the woods well-known to him, to\nthe house of his gamekeeper. The keeper was amazed when he saw his real\nmaster.\n\n\"Is Moreau here?\" said the count. \"I see his horse.\"\n\n\"No, monseigneur; he means to go to Moulineaux before dinner, and he has\nleft his horse here while he went to the chateau to give a few orders.\"\n\n\"If you value your place,\" said the count, \"you will take that horse and\nride at once to Beaumont, where you will deliver to Monsieur Margueron\nthe note that I shall now write.\"\n\nSo saying the count entered the keeper's lodge and wrote a line, folding\nit in a way impossible to open without detection, and gave it to the man\nas soon as he saw him in the saddle.\n\n\"Not a word to any one,\" he said, \"and as for you, madame,\" he added\nto the gamekeeper's wife, \"if Moreau comes back for his horse, tell him\nmerely that I have taken it.\"\n\nThe count then crossed the park and entered the court-yard of the\nchateau through the iron gates. However worn-out a man may be by the\nwear and tear of public life, by his own emotions, by his own mistakes\nand disappointments, the soul of any man able to love deeply at the\ncount's age is still young and sensitive to treachery. Monsieur de\nSerizy had felt such pain at the thought that Moreau had deceived him,\nthat even after hearing the conversation at Saint-Brice he thought\nhim less an accomplice of Leger and the notary than their tool. On the\nthreshold of the inn, and while that conversation was still going on,\nhe thought of pardoning his steward after giving him a good reproof.\nStrange to say, the dishonesty of his confidential agent occupied\nhis mind as a mere episode from the moment when Oscar revealed his\ninfirmities. Secrets so carefully guarded could only have been revealed\nby Moreau, who had, no doubt, laughed over the hidden troubles of\nhis benefactor with either Madame de Serizy's former maid or with the\nAspasia of the Directory.\n\nAs he walked along the wood-path, this peer of France, this statesman,\nwept as young men weep; he wept his last tears. All human feelings\nwere so cruelly hurt by one stroke that the usually calm man staggered\nthrough his park like a wounded deer.\n\nWhen Moreau arrived at the gamekeeper's lodge and asked for his horse,\nthe keeper's wife replied:--\n\n\"Monsieur le comte has just taken it.\"\n\n\"Monsieur le comte!\" cried Moreau. \"Whom do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, the Comte de Serizy, our master,\" she replied. \"He is probably at\nthe chateau by this time,\" she added, anxious to be rid of the steward,\nwho, unable to understand the meaning of her words, turned back towards\nthe chateau.\n\nBut he presently turned again and came back to the lodge, intending to\nquestion the woman more closely; for he began to see something serious\nin this secret arrival, and the apparently strange method of his\nmaster's return. But the wife of the gamekeeper, alarmed to find herself\ncaught in a vise between the count and his steward, had locked herself\ninto the house, resolved not to open to any but her husband. Moreau,\nmore and more uneasy, ran rapidly, in spite of his boots and spurs, to\nthe chateau, where he was told that the count was dressing.\n\n\"Seven persons invited to dinner!\" cried Rosalie as soon as she saw him.\n\nMoreau then went through the offices to his own house. On his way he met\nthe poultry-girl, who was having an altercation with a handsome young\nman.\n\n\"Monsieur le comte particularly told me a colonel, an aide-de-camp of\nMina,\" insisted the girl.\n\n\"I am not a colonel,\" replied Georges.\n\n\"But isn't your name Georges?\"\n\n\"What's all this?\" said the steward, intervening.\n\n\"Monsieur, my name is Georges Marest; I am the son of a rich wholesale\nironmonger in the rue Saint-Martin; I come on business to Monsieur le\nComte de Serizy from Maitre Crottat, a notary, whose second clerk I am.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said the girl, \"am telling him that monseigneur said to me:\n'There'll come a colonel named Czerni-Georges, aide-de-camp to Mina;\nhe'll come by Pierrotin's coach; if he asks for me show him into the\nwaiting-room.'\"\n\n\"Evidently,\" said the clerk, \"the count is a traveller who came down\nwith us in Pierrotin's coucou; if it hadn't been for the politeness of a\nyoung man he'd have come as a rabbit.\"\n\n\"A rabbit! in Pierrotin's coucou!\" exclaimed Moreau and the poultry-girl\ntogether.\n\n\"I am sure of it, from what this girl is now saying,\" said Georges.\n\n\"How so?\" asked the steward.\n\n\"Ah! that's the point,\" cried the clerk. \"To hoax the travellers and\nhave a bit of fun I told them a lot of stuff about Egypt and Greece and\nSpain. As I happened to be wearing spurs I have myself out for a colonel\nof cavalry: pure nonsense!\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" said Moreau, \"what did this traveller you take to be Monsieur\nle comte look like?\"\n\n\"Face like a brick,\" said Georges, \"hair snow-white, and black\neyebrows.\"\n\n\"That is he!\"\n\n\"Then I'm lost!\" exclaimed Georges.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Oh, I chaffed him about his decorations.\"\n\n\"Pooh! he's a good fellow; you probably amused him. Come at once to the\nchateau. I'll go in and see his Excellency. Where did you say he left\nthe coach?\"\n\n\"At the top of the mountain.\"\n\n\"I don't know what to make of it!\"\n\n\"After all,\" thought Georges, \"though I did blague him, I didn't say\nanything insulting.\"\n\n\"Why have you come here?\" asked the steward.\n\n\"I have brought the deed of sale for the farm at Moulineaux, all ready\nfor signature.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" exclaimed the steward, \"I don't understand one word of\nall this!\"\n\nMoreau felt his heart beat painfully when, after giving two raps on his\nmaster's door, he heard the words:--\n\n\"Is that you, _Monsieur_ Moreau?\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Come in.\"\n\nThe count was now wearing a pair of white trousers and thin boots, a\nwhite waistcoat and a black coat on which shone the grand cross of the\nLegion upon the right breast, and fastened to a buttonhole on the left\nwas the order of the Golden Fleece hanging by a short gold chain. He had\narranged his hair himself, and had, no doubt, put himself in full dress\nto do the honors of Presles to Monsieur Margueron; and, possibly, to\nimpress the good man's mind with a prestige of grandeur.\n\n\"Well, monsieur,\" said the count, who remained seated, leaving Moreau to\nstand before him. \"We have not concluded that purchase from Margueron.\"\n\n\"He asks too much for the farm at the present moment.\"\n\n\"But why is he not coming to dinner as I requested?\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, he is ill.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"I have just come from there.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the count, with a stern air which was really terrible,\n\"what would you do with a man whom you trusted, if, after seeing you\ndress wounds which you desired to keep secret from all the world,\nhe should reveal your misfortunes and laugh at your malady with a\nstrumpet?\"\n\n\"I would thrash him for it.\"\n\n\"And if you discovered that he was also betraying your confidence and\nrobbing you?\"\n\n\"I should endeavor to detect him, and send him to the galleys.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Moreau, listen to me. You have undoubtedly spoken of my\ninfirmities to Madame Clapart; you have laughed at her house, and with\nher, over my attachment to the Comtesse de Serizy; for her son, little\nHusson, told a number of circumstances relating to my medical treatment,\nto travellers by a public conveyance in my presence, and Heaven knows in\nwhat language! He dared to calumniate my wife. Besides this, I learned\nfrom the lips of Pere Leger himself, who was in the coach, of the plan\nlaid by the notary at Beaumont and by you and by himself in relation to\nLes Moulineaux. If you have been, as you say, to Monsieur Margueron, it\nwas to tell him to feign illness. He is so little ill that he is coming\nhere to dinner this evening. Now, monsieur, I could pardon you having\nmade two hundred and fifty thousand francs out of your situation in\nseventeen years,--I can understand that. You might each time have asked\nme for what you took, and I would have given it to you; but let that\npass. You have been, notwithstanding this disloyalty, better than\nothers, as I believe. But that you, who knew my toil for our country,\nfor France, you have seen me giving night after night to the Emperor's\nservice, and working eighteen hours of each twenty-four for months\ntogether, you who knew my love for Madame de Serizy,--that you should\nhave gossiped about me before a boy! holding up my secrets and my\naffections to the ridicule of a Madame Husson!--\"\n\n\"Monseigneur!\"\n\n\"It is unpardonable. To injure a man's interest, why, that is nothing;\nbut to stab his heart!--Oh! you do not know what you have done!\"\n\nThe count put his head in his hands and was silent for some moments.\n\n\"I leave you what you have gained,\" he said after a time, \"and I shall\nforget you. For my sake, for my dignity, and for your honor, we will\npart decently; for I cannot but remember even now what your father did\nfor mine. You will explain the duties of the stewardship in a proper\nmanner to Monsieur de Reybert, who succeeds you. Be calm, as I am.\nGive no opportunity for fools to talk. Above all, let there be no\nrecrimination or petty meanness. Though you no longer possess my\nconfidence, endeavor to behave with the decorum of well-bred persons. As\nfor that miserable boy who has wounded me to death, I will not have\nhim sleep at Presles; send him to the inn; I will not answer for my own\ntemper if I see him.\"\n\n\"I do not deserve such gentleness, monseigneur,\" said Moreau, with tears\nin his eyes. \"Yes, you are right; if I had been utterly dishonest I\nshould now be worth five hundred thousand francs instead of half that\nsum. I offer to give you an account of my fortune, with all its details.\nBut let me tell you, monseigneur, that in talking of you with Madame\nClapart, it was never in derision; but, on the contrary, to deplore your\nstate, and to ask her for certain remedies, not used by physicians, but\nknown to the common people. I spoke of your feelings before the boy, who\nwas in his bed and, as I supposed, asleep (it seems he must have been\nawake and listening to us), with the utmost affection and respect.\nAlas! fate wills that indiscretions be punished like crimes. But while\naccepting the results of your just anger, I wish you to know what\nactually took place. It was, indeed, from heart to heart that I spoke\nof you to Madame Clapart. As for my wife, I have never said one word of\nthese things--\"\n\n\"Enough,\" said the count, whose conviction was now complete; \"we are not\nchildren. All is now irrevocable. Put your affairs and mine in order.\nYou can stay in the pavilion until October. Monsieur and Madame de\nReybert will lodge for the present in the chateau; endeavor to keep on\nterms with them, like well-bred persons who hate each other, but still\nkeep up appearances.\"\n\nThe count and Moreau went downstairs; Moreau white as the count's hair,\nthe count himself calm and dignified.\n\nDuring the time this interview lasted the Beaumont coach, which left\nParis at one o'clock, had stopped before the gates of the chateau, and\ndeposited Maitre Crottat, the notary, who was shown, according to the\ncount's orders, into the salon, where he found his clerk, extremely\nsubdued in manner, and the two painters, all three of them painfully\nself-conscious and embarrassed. Monsieur de Reybert, a man of fifty,\nwith a crabbed expression of face, was also there, accompanied by old\nMargueron and the notary of Beaumont, who held in his hand a bundle of\ndeeds and other papers.\n\nWhen these various personages saw the count in evening dress, and\nwearing his orders, Georges Marest had a slight sensation of colic,\nJoseph Bridau quivered, but Mistigris, who was conscious of being in his\nSunday clothes, and had, moreover, nothing on his conscience, remarked,\nin a sufficiently loud tone:--\n\n\"Well, he looks a great deal better like that.\"\n\n\"Little scamp,\" said the count, catching him by the ear, \"we are both\nin the decoration business. I hope you recognize your own work, my dear\nSchinner,\" he added, pointing to the ceiling of the salon.\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" replied the artist, \"I did wrong to take such a\ncelebrated name out of mere bravado; but this day will oblige me to\ndo fine things for you, and so bring credit on my own name of Joseph\nBridau.\"\n\n\"You took up my defence,\" said the count, hastily; \"and I hope you will\ngive me the pleasure of dining with me, as well as my lively friend\nMistigris.\"\n\n\"Your Excellency doesn't know to what you expose yourself,\" said the\nsaucy rapin; \"'facilis descensus victuali,' as we say at the Black Hen.\"\n\n\"Bridau!\" exclaimed the minister, struck by a sudden thought. \"Are you\nany relation to one of the most devoted toilers under the Empire, the\nhead of a bureau, who fell a victim to his zeal?\"\n\n\"His son, monseigneur,\" replied Joseph, bowing.\n\n\"Then you are most welcome here,\" said the count, taking Bridau's hand\nin both of his. \"I knew your father, and you can count on me as on--on\nan uncle in America,\" added the count, laughing. \"But you are too young\nto have pupils of your own; to whom does Mistigris really belong?\"\n\n\"To my friend Schinner, who lent him to me,\" said Joseph. \"Mistigris'\nname is Leon de Lora. Monseigneur, if you knew my father, will you deign\nto think of his other son, who is now accused of plotting against the\nState, and is soon to be tried before the Court of Peers?\"\n\n\"Ah! that's true,\" said the count. \"Yes, I will think about it, be sure\nof that. As for Colonel Czerni-Georges, the friend of Ali Pacha, and\nMina's aide-de-camp--\" he continued, walking up to Georges.\n\n\"He! why that's my second clerk!\" cried Crottat.\n\n\"You are quite mistaken, Maitre Crottat,\" said the count, assuming a\nstern air. \"A clerk who intends to be a notary does not leave important\ndeeds in a diligence at the mercy of other travellers; neither does he\nspend twenty francs between Paris and Moisselles; or expose himself to\nbe arrested as a deserter--\"\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" said Georges Marest, \"I may have amused myself with the\nbourgeois in the diligence, but--\"\n\n\"Let his Excellency finish what he was saying,\" said the notary, digging\nhis elbow into his clerk's ribs.\n\n\"A notary,\" continued the count, \"ought to practise discretion,\nshrewdness, caution from the start; he should be incapable of such a\nblunder as taking a peer of France for a tallow-chandler--\"\n\n\"I am willing to be blamed for my faults,\" said Georges; \"but I never\nleft my deeds at the mercy of--\"\n\n\"Now you are committing the fault of contradicting the word of a\nminister of State, a gentleman, an old man, and a client,\" said the\ncount. \"Give me that deed of sale.\"\n\nGeorges turned over and over the papers in his portfolio.\n\n\"That will do; don't disarrange those papers,\" said the count, taking\nthe deed from his pocket. \"Here is what you are looking for.\"\n\nCrottat turned the paper back and forth, so astonished was he at\nreceiving it from the hands of his client.\n\n\"What does this mean, monsieur?\" he said, finally, to Georges.\n\n\"If I had not taken it,\" said the count, \"Pere Leger,--who is by\nno means such a ninny as you thought him from his questions\nabout agriculture, by which he showed that he attended to his own\nbusiness,--Pere Leger might have seized that paper and guessed my\npurpose. You must give me the pleasure of dining with me, but one on\ncondition,--that of describing, as you promised, the execution of the\nMuslim of Smyrna, and you must also finish the memoirs of some client\nwhich you have certainly read to be so well informed.\"\n\n\"Schlague for blague!\" said Leon de Lora, in a whisper, to Joseph\nBridau.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the count to the two notaries and Messieurs Margueron\nand de Reybert, \"let us go into the next room and conclude this business\nbefore dinner, because, as my friend Mistigris would say: 'Qui esurit\nconstentit.'\"\n\n\"Well, he is very good-natured,\" said Leon de Lora to Georges Marest,\nwhen the count had left the room.\n\n\"Yes, HE may be, but my master isn't,\" said Georges, \"and he will\nrequest me to go and blaguer somewhere else.\"\n\n\"Never mind, you like travel,\" said Bridau.\n\n\"What a dressing that boy will get from Monsieur and Madame Moreau!\"\ncried Mistigris.\n\n\"Little idiot!\" said Georges. \"If it hadn't been for him the count would\nhave been amused. Well, anyhow, the lesson is a good one; and if ever\nagain I am caught bragging in a public coach--\"\n\n\"It is a stupid thing to do,\" said Joseph Bridau.\n\n\"And common,\" added Mistigris. \"'Vulgarity is the brother of\npretension.'\"\n\nWhile the matter of the sale was being settled between Monsieur\nMargueron and the Comte de Serizy, assisted by their respective notaries\nin presence of Monsieur de Reybert, the ex-steward walked with slow\nsteps to his own house. There he entered the salon and sat down without\nnoticing anything. Little Husson, who was present, slipped into a\ncorner, out of sight, so much did the livid face of his mother's friend\nalarm him.\n\n\"Eh! my friend!\" said Estelle, coming into the room, somewhat tired with\nwhat she had been doing. \"What is the matter?\"\n\n\"My dear, we are lost,--lost beyond recovery. I am no longer steward of\nPresles, no longer in the count's confidence.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Pere Leger, who was in Pierrotin's coach, told the count all about the\naffair of Les Moulineaux. But that is not the thing that has cost me his\nfavor.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Oscar spoke ill of the countess, and he told about the count's\ndiseases.\"\n\n\"Oscar!\" cried Madame Moreau. \"Ah! my dear, your sin has found you out.\nIt was well worth while to warm that young serpent in your bosom. How\noften I have told you--\"\n\n\"Enough!\" said Moreau, in a strained voice.\n\nAt this moment Estelle and her husband discovered Oscar cowering in his\ncorner. Moreau swooped down on the luckless lad like a hawk on its prey,\ntook him by the collar of the coat and dragged him to the light of a\nwindow. \"Speak! what did you say to monseigneur in that coach? What\ndemon let loose your tongue, you who keep a doltish silence whenever I\nspeak to you? What did you do it for?\" cried the steward, with frightful\nviolence.\n\nToo bewildered to weep, Oscar was dumb and motionless as a statue.\n\n\"Come with me and beg his Excellency's pardon,\" said Moreau.\n\n\"As if his Excellency cares for a little toad like that!\" cried the\nfurious Estelle.\n\n\"Come, I say, to the chateau,\" repeated Moreau.\n\nOscar dropped like an inert mass to the ground.\n\n\"Come!\" cried Moreau, his anger increasing at every instant.\n\n\"No! no! mercy!\" cried Oscar, who could not bring himself to submit to a\ntorture that seemed to him worse than death.\n\nMoreau then took the lad by his coat, and dragged him, as he might a\ndead body, through the yards, which rang with the boy's outcries and\nsobs. He pulled him up the portico, and, with an arm that fury made\npowerful, he flung him, bellowing, and rigid as a pole, into the salon,\nat the very feet of the count, who, having completed the purchase of Les\nMoulineaux, was about to leave the salon for the dining-room with his\nguests.\n\n\"On your knees, wretched boy! and ask pardon of him who gave food to\nyour mind by obtaining your scholarship.\"\n\nOscar, his face to the ground, was foaming with rage, and did not say a\nword. The spectators of the scene were shocked. Moreau seemed no longer\nin his senses; his face was crimson with injected blood.\n\n\"This young man is a mere lump of vanity,\" said the count, after waiting\na moment for Oscar's excuses. \"A proud man humiliates himself because he\nsees there is grandeur in a certain self-abasement. I am afraid that you\nwill never make much of that lad.\"\n\nSo saying, his Excellency passed on. Moreau took Oscar home with him;\nand on the way gave orders that the horses should immediately be put to\nMadame Moreau's caleche.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. A MOTHER'S TRIALS\n\n\nWhile the horses were being harnessed, Moreau wrote the following letter\nto Madame Clapart:--\n\n  My dear,--Oscar has ruined me. During his journey in Pierrotin's\n  coach, he spoke of Madame de Serizy's behavior to his Excellency,\n  who was travelling incognito, and actually told, to himself, the\n  secret of his terrible malady. After dismissing me from my\n  stewardship, the count told me not to let Oscar sleep at Presles,\n  but to send him away immediately. Therefore, to obey his orders,\n  the horses are being harnessed at this moment to my wife's\n  carriage, and Brochon, my stable-man, will take the miserable\n  child to you to-night.\n\n  We are, my wife and I, in a distress of mind which you may perhaps\n  imagine, though I cannot describe it to you. I will see you in a\n  few days, for I must take another course. I have three children,\n  and I ought to consider their future. At present I do not know\n  what to do; but I shall certainly endeavor to make the count aware\n  of what seventeen years of the life of a man like myself is worth.\n  Owning at the present moment about two hundred and fifty thousand\n  francs, I want to raise myself to a fortune which may some day\n  make me the equal of his Excellency. At this moment I feel within\n  me the power to move mountains and vanquish insurmountable\n  difficulties. What a lever is such a scene of bitter humiliation\n  as I have just passed through! Whose blood has Oscar in his veins?\n  His conduct has been that of a blockhead; up to this moment when I\n  write to you, he has not said a word nor answered, even by a sign,\n  the questions my wife and I have put to him. Will he become an\n  idiot? or is he one already? Dear friend, why did you not instruct\n  him as to his behavior before you sent him to me? How many\n  misfortunes you would have spared me, had you brought him here\n  yourself as I begged you to do. If Estelle alarmed you, you might\n  have stayed at Moisselles. However, the thing is done, and there\n  is no use talking about it.\n\n  Adieu; I shall see you soon.\n\nYour devoted servant and friend,\n\nMoreau\n\n\nAt eight o'clock that evening, Madame Clapart, just returned from a walk\nshe had taken with her husband, was knitting winter socks for Oscar, by\nthe light of a single candle. Monsieur Clapart was expecting a friend\nnamed Poiret, who often came in to play dominoes, for never did he allow\nhimself to spend an evening at a cafe. In spite of the prudent economy\nto which his small means forced him, Clapart would not have answered for\nhis temperance amid a luxury of food and in presence of the usual guests\nof a cafe whose inquisitive observation would have piqued him.\n\n\"I'm afraid Poiret came while we were out,\" said Clapart to his wife.\n\n\"Why, no, my friend; the portress would have told us so when we came\nin,\" replied Madame Clapart.\n\n\"She may have forgotten it.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so?\"\n\n\"It wouldn't be the first time she has forgotten things for us,--for God\nknows how people without means are treated.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the poor woman, to change the conversation and escape\nClapart's cavilling, \"Oscar must be at Presles by this time. How he will\nenjoy that fine house and the beautiful park.\"\n\n\"Oh! yes,\" snarled Clapart, \"you expect fine things of him; but, mark my\nwords, there'll be squabbles wherever he goes.\"\n\n\"Will you never cease to find fault with that poor child?\" said the\nmother. \"What has he done to you? If some day we should live at our\nease, we may owe it all to him; he has such a good heart--\"\n\n\"Our bones will be jelly long before that fellow makes his way in the\nworld,\" cried Clapart. \"You don't know your own child; he is conceited,\nboastful, deceitful, lazy, incapable of--\"\n\n\"Why don't you go to meet Poiret?\" said the poor mother, struck to the\nheart by the diatribe she had brought upon herself.\n\n\"A boy who has never won a prize at school!\" continued Clapart.\n\nTo bourgeois eyes, the obtaining of school prizes means the certainty of\na fine future for the fortunate child.\n\n\"Did you win any?\" asked his wife. \"Oscar stood second in philosophy.\"\n\nThis remark imposed silence for a moment on Clapart; but presently he\nbegan again.\n\n\"Besides, Madame Moreau hates him like poison, you know why. She'll try\nto set her husband against him. Oscar to step into his shoes as steward\nof Presles! Why he'd have to learn agriculture, and know how to survey.\"\n\n\"He can learn.\"\n\n\"He--that pussy cat! I'll bet that if he does get a place down there,\nit won't be a week before he does some doltish thing which will make the\ncount dismiss him.\"\n\n\"Good God! how can you be so bitter against a poor child who is full of\ngood qualities, sweet-tempered as an angel, incapable of doing harm to\nany one, no matter who.\"\n\nJust then the cracking of a postilion's whip and the noise of a carriage\nstopping before the house was heard, this arrival having apparently put\nthe whole street into a commotion. Clapart, who heard the opening of\nmany windows, looked out himself to see what was happening.\n\n\"They have sent Oscar back to you in a post-chaise,\" he cried, in a tone\nof satisfaction, though in truth he felt inwardly uneasy.\n\n\"Good heavens! what can have happened to him?\" cried the poor mother,\ntrembling like a leaf shaken by the autumn wind.\n\nBrochon here came up, followed by Oscar and Poiret.\n\n\"What has happened?\" repeated the mother, addressing the stable-man.\n\n\"I don't know, but Monsieur Moreau is no longer steward of Presles, and\nthey say your son has caused it. His Excellency ordered that he should\nbe sent home to you. Here's a letter from poor Monsieur Moreau, madame,\nwhich will tell you all. You never saw a man so changed in a single\nday.\"\n\n\"Clapart, two glasses of wine for the postilion and for monsieur!\" cried\nthe mother, flinging herself into a chair that she might read the fatal\nletter. \"Oscar,\" she said, staggering towards her bed, \"do you want to\nkill your mother? After all the cautions I gave you this morning--\"\n\nShe did not end her sentence, for she fainted from distress of mind.\nWhen she came to herself she heard her husband saying to Oscar, as he\nshook him by the arm:--\n\n\"Will you answer me?\"\n\n\"Go to bed, monsieur,\" she said to her son. \"Let him alone, Monsieur\nClapart. Don't drive him out of his senses; he is frightfully changed.\"\n\nOscar did not hear his mother's last words; he had slipped away to bed\nthe instant that he got the order.\n\nThose who remember their youth will not be surprised to learn that\nafter a day so filled with events and emotions, Oscar, in spite of the\nenormity of his offences, slept the sleep of the just. The next day he\ndid not find the world so changed as he thought it; he was surprised\nto be very hungry,--he who the night before had regarded himself as\nunworthy to live. He had only suffered mentally. At his age mental\nimpressions succeed each other so rapidly that the last weakens its\npredecessor, however deeply the first may have been cut in. For this\nreason corporal punishment, though philanthropists are deeply opposed\nto it in these days, becomes necessary in certain cases for certain\nchildren. It is, moreover, the most natural form of retribution, for\nNature herself employs it; she uses pain to impress a lasting memory of\nher precepts. If to the shame of the preceding evening, unhappily too\ntransient, the steward had joined some personal chastisement, perhaps\nthe lesson might have been complete. The discernment with which such\npunishment needs to be administered is the greatest argument against it.\nNature is never mistaken; but the teacher is, and frequently.\n\nMadame Clapart took pains to send her husband out, so that she might be\nalone with her son the next morning. She was in a state to excite\npity. Her eyes, worn with tears; her face, weary with the fatigue of\na sleepless night; her feeble voice,--in short, everything about her\nproved an excess of suffering she could not have borne a second time,\nand appealed to sympathy.\n\nWhen Oscar entered the room she signed to him to sit down beside her,\nand reminded him in a gentle but grieved voice of the benefits they had\nso constantly received from the steward of Presles. She told him that\nthey had lived, especially for the last six years, on the delicate\ncharity of Monsieur Moreau; and that Monsieur Clapart's salary, also\nthe \"demi-bourse,\" or scholarship, by which he (Oscar) had obtained an\neducation, was due to the Comte de Serizy. Most of this would now cease.\nMonsieur Clapart, she said, had no claim to a pension,--his period of\nservice not being long enough to obtain one. On the day when he was no\nlonger able to keep his place, what would become of them?\n\n\"For myself,\" she said, \"by nursing the sick, or living as a housekeeper\nin some great family, I could support myself and Monsieur Clapart; but\nyou, Oscar, what could you do? You have no means, and you must earn\nsome, for you must live. There are but four careers for a young man\nlike you,--commerce, government employment, the licensed professions, or\nmilitary service. All forms of commerce need capital, and we have none\nto give you. In place of capital, a young man can only give devotion and\nhis capacity. But commerce also demands the utmost discretion, and your\nconduct yesterday proves that you lack it. To enter a government office,\nyou must go through a long probation by the help of influence, and you\nhave just alienated the only protector that we had,--a most powerful\none. Besides, suppose you were to meet with some extraordinary help, by\nwhich a young man makes his way promptly either in business or in\nthe public employ, where could you find the money to live and clothe\nyourself during the time that you are learning your employment?\"\n\nHere the mother wandered, like other women, into wordy lamentation: What\nshould she do now to feed the family, deprived of the benefits Moreau's\nstewardship had enabled him to send her from Presles? Oscar had\noverthrown his benefactor's prosperity! As commerce and a government\nclerkship were now impossible, there remained only the professions of\nnotary and lawyer, either barristers or solicitors, and sheriffs. But\nfor those he must study at least three years, and pay considerable sums\nfor entrance fees, examinations, certificates, and diplomas; and here\nagain the question of maintenance presented itself.\n\n\"Oscar,\" she said, in conclusion, \"in you I had put all my pride, all my\nlife. In accepting for myself an unhappy old age, I fastened my eyes on\nyou; I saw you with the prospect of a fine career, and I imagined you\nsucceeding in it. That thought, that hope, gave me courage to face the\nprivations I have endured for six years in order to carry you through\nschool, where you have cost me, in spite of the scholarship, between\nseven and eight hundred francs a year. Now that my hope is vanishing,\nyour future terrifies me. I cannot take one penny from Monsieur\nClapart's salary for my son. What can you do? You are not strong enough\nto mathematics to enter any of the technical schools; and, besides,\nwhere could I get the three thousand francs board-money which they\nextract? This is life as it is, my child. You are eighteen, you are\nstrong. Enlist in the army; it is your only means, that I can see, to\nearn your bread.\"\n\nOscar knew as yet nothing whatever of life. Like all children who have\nbeen kept from a knowledge of the trials and poverty of the home, he\nwas ignorant of the necessity of earning his living. The word \"commerce\"\npresented no idea whatever to his mind; \"public employment\" said almost\nas little, for he saw no results of it. He listened, therefore, with\na submissive air, which he tried to make humble, to his mother's\nexhortations, but they were lost in the void, and did not reach his\nmind. Nevertheless, the word \"army,\" the thought of being a soldier, and\nthe sight of his mother's tears did at last make him cry. No sooner\ndid Madame Clapart see the drops coursing down his cheeks than she felt\nherself helpless, and, like most mothers in such cases, she began the\nperoration which terminates these scenes,--scenes in which they suffer\ntheir own anguish and that of their children also.\n\n\"Well, Oscar, _promise_ me that you will be more discreet in\nfuture,--that you will not talk heedlessly any more, but will strive to\nrepress your silly vanity,\" et cetera, et cetera.\n\nOscar of course promised all his mother asked him to promise, and then,\nafter gently drawing him to her, Madame Clapart ended by kissing him to\nconsole him for being scolded.\n\n\"In future,\" she said, \"you will listen to your mother, and will follow\nher advice; for a mother can give nothing but good counsel to her child.\nWe will go and see your uncle Cardot; that is our last hope. Cardot\nowed a great deal to your father, who gave him his sister, Mademoiselle\nHusson, with an enormous dowry for those days, which enabled him to make\na large fortune in the silk trade. I think he might, perhaps, place\nyou with Monsieur Camusot, his successor and son-in-law, in the rue des\nBourdonnais. But, you see, your uncle Cardot has four children. He\ngave his establishment, the Cocon d'Or, to his eldest daughter, Madame\nCamusot; and though Camusot has millions, he has also four children by\ntwo wives; and, besides, he scarcely knows of our existence. Cardot has\nmarried his second daughter, Mariane, to Monsieur Protez, of the firm\nof Protez and Chiffreville. The practice of his eldest son, the notary,\ncost him four hundred thousand francs; and he has just put his second\nson, Joseph, into the drug business of Matifat. So you see, your uncle\nCardot has many reasons not to take an interest in you, whom he sees\nonly four times a year. He has never come to call upon me here, though\nhe was ready enough to visit me at Madame Mere's when he wanted to sell\nhis silks to the Emperor, the imperial highnesses, and all the great\npeople at court. But now the Camusots have turned ultras. The eldest son\nof Camusot's first wife married a daughter of one of the king's ushers.\nThe world is mighty hump-backed when it stoops! However, it was a clever\nthing to do, for the Cocon d'Or has the custom of the present court as\nit had that of the Emperor. But to-morrow we will go and see your uncle\nCardot, and I hope that you will endeavor to behave properly; for, as I\nsaid before, and I repeat it, that is our last hope.\"\n\nMonsieur Jean-Jerome-Severin Cardot had been a widower six years. As\nhead-clerk of the Cocon d'Or, one of the oldest firms in Paris, he had\nbought the establishment in 1793, at a time when the heads of the house\nwere ruined by the maximum; and the money of Mademoiselle Husson's\ndowry had enabled him to do this, and so make a fortune that was almost\ncolossal in ten years. To establish his children richly during his\nlifetime, he had conceived the idea of buying an annuity for himself and\nhis wife with three hundred thousand francs, which gave him an income\nof thirty thousand francs a year. He then divided his capital into three\nshares of four hundred thousand francs each, which he gave to three\nof his children,--the Cocon d'Or, given to his eldest daughter on her\nmarriage, being the equivalent of a fourth share. Thus the worthy man,\nwho was now nearly seventy years old, could spend his thirty thousand a\nyear as he pleased, without feeling that he injured the prospects of\nhis children, all finely provided for, whose attentions and proofs of\naffection were, moreover, not prompted by self-interest.\n\nUncle Cardot lived at Belleville, in one of the first houses above\nthe Courtille. He there occupied, on the first floor, an apartment\noverlooking the valley of the Seine, with a southern exposure, and the\nexclusive enjoyment of a large garden, for the sum of a thousand francs\na year. He troubled himself not at all about the three or four other\ntenants of the same vast country-house. Certain, through a long lease,\nof ending his days there, he lived rather plainly, served by an old cook\nand the former maid of the late Madame Cardot,--both of whom expected\nto reap an annuity of some six hundred francs apiece on the old man's\ndeath. These two women took the utmost care of him, and were all the\nmore interested in doing so because no one was ever less fussy or less\nfault-finding than he. The apartment, furnished by the late Madame\nCardot, had remained in the same condition for the last six years,--the\nold man being perfectly contented with it. He spent in all not more than\nthree thousand francs a year there; for he dined in Paris five days\nin the week, and returned home at midnight in a hackney-coach, which\nbelonged to an establishment at Courtille. The cook had only her\nmaster's breakfast to provide on those days. This was served at eleven\no'clock; after that he dressed and perfumed himself, and departed for\nParis. Usually, a bourgeois gives notice in the household if he dines\nout; old Cardot, on the contrary, gave notice when he dined at home.\n\nThis little old man--fat, rosy, squat, and strong--always looked, in\npopular speech, as if he had stepped from a bandbox. He appeared in\nblack silk stockings, breeches of \"pou-de-soie\" (paduasoy), a white\npique waistcoat, dazzling shirt-front, a blue-bottle coat, violet silk\ngloves, gold buckles to his shoes and his breeches, and, lastly, a\ntouch of powder and a little queue tied with black ribbon. His face\nwas remarkable for a pair of eyebrows as thick as bushes, beneath which\nsparkled his gray eyes; and for a square nose, thick and long, which\ngave him somewhat the air of the abbes of former times. His countenance\ndid not belie him. Pere Cardot belonged to that race of lively Gerontes\nwhich is now disappearing rapidly, though it once served as Turcarets\nto the comedies and tales of the eighteenth century. Uncle Cardot always\nsaid \"Fair lady,\" and he placed in their carriages, and otherwise paid\nattention to those women whom he saw without protectors; he \"placed\nhimself at their disposition,\" as he said, in his chivalrous way.\n\nBut beneath his calm air and his snowy poll he concealed an old age\nalmost wholly given up to mere pleasure. Among men he openly professed\nepicureanism, and gave himself the license of free talk. He had seen\nno harm in the devotion of his son-in-law, Camusot, to Mademoiselle\nCoralie, for he himself was secretly the Mecaenas of Mademoiselle\nFlorentine, the first danseuse at the Gaiete. But this life and these\nopinions never appeared in his own home, nor in his external conduct\nbefore the world. Uncle Cardot, grave and polite, was thought to be\nsomewhat cold, so much did he affect decorum; a \"devote\" would have\ncalled him a hypocrite.\n\nThe worthy old gentleman hated priests; he belonged to that great\nflock of ninnies who subscribed to the \"Constitutionnel,\" and was much\nconcerned about \"refusals to bury.\" He adored Voltaire, though his\npreferences were really for Piron, Vade, and Colle. Naturally, he\nadmired Beranger, whom he wittily called the \"grandfather of the\nreligion of Lisette.\" His daughters, Madame Camusot and Madame\nProtez, and his two sons would, to use a popular expression, have been\nflabbergasted if any one had explained to them what their father meant\nby \"singing la Mere Godichon.\"\n\nThis long-headed parent had never mentioned his income to his children,\nwho, seeing that he lived in a cheap way, reflected that he had deprived\nhimself of his property for their sakes, and, therefore, redoubled\ntheir attentions and tenderness. In fact, he would sometimes say to his\nsons:--\n\n\"Don't lose your property; remember, I have none to leave you.\"\n\nCamusot, in whom he recognized a certain likeness to his own nature,\nand whom he liked enough to make a sharer in his secret pleasures, alone\nknew of the thirty thousand a year annuity. But Camusot approved of the\nold man's ethics, and thought that, having made the happiness of his\nchildren and nobly fulfilled his duty by them, he now had a right to end\nhis life jovially.\n\n\"Don't you see, my friend,\" said the former master of the Cocon d'Or,\n\"I might re-marry. A young woman would give me more children. Well,\nFlorentine doesn't cost me what a wife would; neither does she bore me;\nand she won't give me children to lessen your property.\"\n\nCamusot considered that Pere Cardot gave expression to a high sense\nof family duty in these words; he regarded him as an admirable\nfather-in-law.\n\n\"He knows,\" thought he, \"how to unite the interests of his children\nwith the pleasures which old age naturally desires after the worries of\nbusiness life.\"\n\nNeither the Cardots, nor the Camusots, nor the Protez knew anything\nof the ways of life of their aunt Clapart. The family intercourse was\nrestricted to the sending of notes of \"faire part\" on the occasion\nof deaths and marriages, and cards at the New Year. The proud Madame\nClapart would never have brought herself to seek them were it not for\nOscar's interests, and because of her friendship for Moreau, the only\nperson who had been faithful to her in misfortune. She had never annoyed\nold Cardot by her visits, or her importunities, but she held to him as\nto a hope, and always went to see him once every three months and talked\nto him of Oscar, the nephew of the late respectable Madame Cardot; and\nshe took the boy to call upon him three times during each vacation. At\neach of these visits the old gentleman had given Oscar a dinner at the\nCadran-Bleu, taking him, afterwards, to the Gaiete, and returning him\nsafely to the rue de la Cerisaie. On one occasion, having given the boy\nan entirely new suit of clothes, he added the silver cup and fork and\nspoon required for his school outfit.\n\nOscar's mother endeavored to impress the old gentleman with the idea\nthat his nephew cherished him, and she constantly referred to the cup\nand the fork and spoon and to the beautiful suit of clothes, though\nnothing was then left of the latter but the waistcoat. But such little\narts did Oscar more harm than good when practised on so sly an old fox\nas uncle Cardot. The latter had never much liked his departed wife, a\ntall, spare, red-haired woman; he was also aware of the circumstances of\nthe late Husson's marriage with Oscar's mother, and without in the least\ncondemning her, he knew very well that Oscar was a posthumous child. His\nnephew, therefore, seemed to him to have no claims on the Cardot family.\nBut Madame Clapart, like all women who concentrate their whole being\ninto the sentiment of motherhood, did not put herself in Cardot's place\nand see the matter from his point of view; she thought he must certainly\nbe interested in so sweet a child, who bore the maiden name of his late\nwife.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said old Cardot's maid-servant, coming out to him as\nhe walked about the garden while awaiting his breakfast, after his\nhairdresser had duly shaved him and powdered his queue, \"the mother of\nyour nephew, Oscar, is here.\"\n\n\"Good-day, fair lady,\" said the old man, bowing to Madame Clapart, and\nwrapping his white pique dressing-gown about him. \"Hey, hey! how this\nlittle fellow grows,\" he added, taking Oscar by the ear.\n\n\"He has finished school, and he regretted so much that his dear uncle\nwas not present at the distribution of the Henri IV. prizes, at which\nhe was named. The name of Husson, which, let us hope, he will bear\nworthily, was proclaimed--\"\n\n\"The deuce it was!\" exclaimed the little old man, stopping short. Madame\nClapart, Oscar, and he were walking along a terrace flanked by oranges,\nmyrtles, and pomegranates. \"And what did he get?\"\n\n\"The fourth rank in philosophy,\" replied the mother proudly.\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" cried uncle Cardot, \"the rascal has a good deal to do to make\nup for lost time; for the fourth rank in philosophy, well, _it isn't\nPeru_, you know! You will stay and breakfast with me?\" he added.\n\n\"We are at your orders,\" replied Madame Clapart. \"Ah! my dear Monsieur\nCardot, what happiness it is for fathers and mothers when their children\nmake a good start in life! In this respect--indeed, in all others,\" she\nadded, catching herself up, \"you are one of the most fortunate fathers\nI have ever known. Under your virtuous son-in-law and your amiable\ndaughter, the Cocon d'Or continues to be the greatest establishment of\nits kind in Paris. And here's your eldest son, for the last ten years\nat the head of a fine practice and married to wealth. And you have such\ncharming little granddaughters! You are, as it were, the head of four\ngreat families. Leave us, Oscar; go and look at the garden, but don't\ntouch the flowers.\"\n\n\"Why, he's eighteen years old!\" said uncle Cardot, smiling at this\ninjunction, which made an infant of Oscar.\n\n\"Alas, yes, he is eighteen, my good Monsieur Cardot; and after bringing\nhim so far, sound and healthy in mind and body, neither bow-legged nor\ncrooked, after sacrificing everything to give him an education, it would\nbe hard if I could not see him on the road to fortune.\"\n\n\"That Monsieur Moreau who got him the scholarship will be sure to look\nafter his career,\" said uncle Cardot, concealing his hypocrisy under an\nair of friendly good-humor.\n\n\"Monsieur Moreau may die,\" she said. \"And besides, he has quarrelled\nirrevocably with the Comte de Serizy, his patron.\"\n\n\"The deuce he has! Listen, madame; I see you are about to--\"\n\n\"No, monsieur,\" said Oscar's mother, interrupting the old man, who,\nout of courtesy to the \"fair lady,\" repressed his annoyance at being\ninterrupted. \"Alas, you do not know the miseries of a mother who, for\nseven years past, has been forced to take a sum of six hundred francs a\nyear for her son's education from the miserable eighteen hundred francs\nof her husband's salary. Yes, monsieur, that is all we have had to live\nupon. Therefore, what more can I do for my poor Oscar? Monsieur Clapart\nso hates the child that it is impossible for me to keep him in the\nhouse. A poor woman, alone in the world, am I not right to come and\nconsult the only relation my Oscar has under heaven?\"\n\n\"Yes, you are right,\" said uncle Cardot. \"You never told me of all this\nbefore.\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur!\" replied Madame Clapart, proudly, \"you were the last\nto whom I would have told my wretchedness. It is all my own fault;\nI married a man whose incapacity is almost beyond belief. Yes, I am,\nindeed, most unhappy.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, madame,\" said the little old man, \"and don't weep; it is\nmost painful to me to see a fair lady cry. After all, your son bears the\nname of Husson, and if my dear deceased wife were living she would wish\nto do something for the name of her father and of her brother--\"\n\n\"She loved her brother,\" said Oscar's mother.\n\n\"But all my fortune is given to my children, who expect nothing from\nme at my death,\" continued the old man. \"I have divided among them the\nmillions that I had, because I wanted to see them happy and enjoying\ntheir wealth during my lifetime. I have nothing now except an annuity;\nand at my age one clings to old habits. Do you know the path on which\nyou ought to start this young fellow?\" he went on, after calling to\nOscar and taking him by the arm. \"Let him study law; I'll pay the\ncosts. Put him in a lawyer's office and let him learn the business of\npettifogging; if he does well, if he distinguishes himself, if he likes\nhis profession and I am still alive, each of my children shall, when the\nproper time comes, lend him a quarter of the cost of a practice; and I\nwill be security for him. You will only have to feed and clothe him. Of\ncourse he'll sow a few wild oats, but he'll learn life. Look at me: I\nleft Lyon with two double louis which my grandmother gave me, and walked\nto Paris; and what am I now? Fasting is good for the health. Discretion,\nhonesty, and work, young man, and you'll succeed. There's a great deal\nof pleasure in earning one's fortune; and if a man keeps his teeth\nhe eats what he likes in his old age, and sings, as I do, 'La Mere\nGodichon.' Remember my words: Honesty, work, discretion.\"\n\n\"Do you hear that, Oscar?\" said his mother. \"Your uncle sums up in three\nwords all that I have been saying to you. You ought to carve the last\nword in letters of fire on your memory.\"\n\n\"Oh, I have,\" said Oscar.\n\n\"Very good,--then thank your uncle; didn't you hear him say he would\ntake charge of your future? You will be a lawyer in Paris.\"\n\n\"He doesn't see the grandeur of his destiny,\" said the little old man,\nobserving Oscar's apathetic air. \"Well, he's just out of school. Listen,\nI'm no talker,\" he continued; \"but I have this to say: Remember that\nat your age honesty and uprightness are maintained only by resisting\ntemptations; of which, in a great city like Paris, there are many at\nevery step. Live in your mother's home, in the garret; go straight to\nthe law-school; from there to your lawyer's office; drudge night and\nday, and study at home. Become, by the time you are twenty-two, a second\nclerk; by the time you are twenty-four, head-clerk; be steady, and you\nwill win all. If, moreover, you shouldn't like the profession, you\nmight enter the office of my son the notary, and eventually succeed\nhim. Therefore, work, patience, discretion, honesty,--those are your\nlandmarks.\"\n\n\"God grant that you may live thirty years longer to see your fifth child\nrealizing all we expect from him,\" cried Madame Clapart, seizing uncle\nCardot's hand and pressing it with a gesture that recalled her youth.\n\n\"Now come to breakfast,\" replied the kind old man, leading Oscar by the\near.\n\nDuring the meal uncle Cardot observed his nephew without appearing to do\nso, and soon saw that the lad knew nothing of life.\n\n\"Send him here to me now and then,\" he said to Madame Clapart, as he\nbade her good-bye, \"and I'll form him for you.\"\n\nThis visit calmed the anxieties of the poor mother, who had not hoped\nfor such brilliant success. For the next fortnight she took Oscar to\nwalk daily, and watched him tyrannically. This brought matters to the\nend of October. One morning as the poor household was breakfasting on a\nsalad of herring and lettuce, with milk for a dessert, Oscar beheld with\nterror the formidable ex-steward, who entered the room and surprised\nthis scene of poverty.\n\n\"We are now living in Paris--but not as we lived at Presles,\" said\nMoreau, wishing to make known to Madame Clapart the change in their\nrelations caused by Oscar's folly. \"I shall seldom be here myself; for\nI have gone into partnership with Pere Leger and Pere Margueron of\nBeaumont. We are speculating in land, and we have begun by purchasing\nthe estate of Persan. I am the head of the concern, which has a capital\nof a million; part of which I have borrowed on my own securities. When I\nfind a good thing, Pere Leger and I examine it; my partners have each a\nquarter and I a half in the profits; but I do nearly all the work, and\nfor that reason I shall be constantly on the road. My wife lives here,\nin the faubourg du Roule, very plainly. When we see how the business\nturns out, if we risk only the profits, and if Oscar behaves himself, we\nmay, perhaps, employ him.\"\n\n\"Ah! my friend, the catastrophe caused by my poor boy's heedlessness may\nprove to be the cause of your making a brilliant fortune; for, really\nand truly, you were burying your energy and your capacity at Presles.\"\n\nMadame Clapart then went on to relate her visit to uncle Cardot, in\norder to show Moreau that neither she nor her son need any longer be a\nburden on him.\n\n\"He is right, that old fellow,\" said the ex-steward. \"We must hold Oscar\nin that path with an iron hand, and he will end as a barrister or a\nnotary. But he mustn't leave the track; he must go straight through with\nit. Ha! I know how to help you. The legal business of land-agents is\nquite important, and I have heard of a lawyer who has just bought what\nis called a \"titre nu\"; that means a practice without clients. He is a\nyoung man, hard as an iron bar, eager for work, ferociously active.\nHis name is Desroches. I'll offer him our business on condition that he\ntakes Oscar as a pupil; and I'll ask him to let the boy live with him at\nnine hundred francs a year, of which I will pay three, so that your son\nwill cost you only six hundred francs, without his living, in future.\nIf the boy ever means to become a man it can only be under a discipline\nlike that. He'll come out of that office, notary, solicitor, or\nbarrister, as he may elect.\"\n\n\"Come, Oscar; thank our kind Monsieur Moreau, and don't stand there like\na stone post. All young men who commit follies have not the good fortune\nto meet with friends who still take an interest in their career, even\nafter they have been injured by them.\"\n\n\"The best way to make your peace with me,\" said Moreau, pressing Oscar's\nhand, \"is to work now with steady application, and to conduct yourself\nin future properly.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. TRICKS AND FARCES OF THE EMBRYO LONG ROBE\n\n\nTen days later, Oscar was taken by Monsieur Moreau to Maitre Desroches,\nsolicitor, recently established in the rue de Bethisy, in a vast\napartment at the end of a narrow court-yard, for which he was paying a\nrelatively low price.\n\nDesroches, a young man twenty-six years of age, born of poor parents,\nand brought up with extreme severity by a stern father, had himself\nknown the condition in which Oscar now was. Accordingly, he felt an\ninterest in him, but the sort of interest which alone he could take,\nchecked by the apparent harshness that characterized him. The aspect\nof this gaunt young man, with a muddy skin and hair cropped like a\nclothes-brush, who was curt of speech and possessed a piercing eye and a\ngloomy vivaciousness, terrified the unhappy Oscar.\n\n\"We work here day and night,\" said the lawyer, from the depths of his\narmchair, and behind a table on which were papers, piled up like Alps.\n\"Monsieur Moreau, we won't kill him; but he'll have to go at our pace.\nMonsieur Godeschal!\" he called out.\n\nThough the day was Sunday, the head-clerk appeared, pen in hand.\n\n\"Monsieur Godeschal, here's the pupil of whom I spoke to you. Monsieur\nMoreau takes the liveliest interest in him. He will dine with us and\nsleep in the small attic next to your chamber. You will allot the exact\ntime it takes to go to the law-school and back, so that he does not lose\nfive minutes on the way. You will see that he learns the Code and is\nproficient in his classes; that is to say, after he has done his work\nhere, you will give him authors to read. In short, he is to be under\nyour immediate direction, and I shall keep an eye on it. They want to\nmake him what you have made yourself, a capable head-clerk, against the\ntime when he can take such a place himself. Go with Monsieur Godeschal,\nmy young friend; he'll show you your lodging, and you can settle down in\nit. Did you notice Godeschal?\" continued Desroches, speaking to Moreau.\n\"There's a fellow who, like me, has nothing. His sister Mariette, the\nfamous danseuse, is laying up her money to buy him a practice in ten\nyears. My clerks are young blades who have nothing but their ten fingers\nto rely upon. So we all, my five clerks and I, work as hard as a dozen\nordinary fellows. But in ten years I'll have the finest practice in\nParis. In my office, business and clients are a passion, and that's\nbeginning to make itself felt. I took Godeschal from Derville, where he\nwas only just made second clerk. He gets a thousand francs a year from\nme, and food and lodging. But he's worth it; he is indefatigable. I love\nhim, that fellow! He has managed to live, as I did when a clerk, on six\nhundred francs a year. What I care for above all is honesty, spotless\nintegrity; and when it is practised in such poverty as that, a man's a\nman. For the slightest fault of that kind a clerk leaves my office.\"\n\n\"The lad is in a good school,\" thought Moreau.\n\nFor two whole years Oscar lived in the rue de Bethisy, a den of\npettifogging; for if ever that superannuated expression was applicable\nto a lawyer's office, it was so in this case. Under this supervision,\nboth petty and able, he was kept to his regular hours and to his work\nwith such rigidity that his life in the midst of Paris was that of a\nmonk.\n\nAt five in the morning, in all weathers, Godeschal woke up. He went down\nwith Oscar to the office, where they always found their master up and\nworking. Oscar then did the errands of the office and prepared his\nlessons for the law-school,--and prepared them elaborately; for\nGodeschal, and frequently Desroches himself, pointed out to their pupil\nauthors to be looked through and difficulties to overcome. He was not\nallowed to leave a single section of the Code until he had thoroughly\nmastered it to the satisfaction of his chief and Godeschal, who put him\nthrough preliminary examinations more searching and longer than those of\nthe law-school. On his return from his classes, where he was kept but a\nshort time, he went to his work in the office; occasionally he was sent\nto the Palais, but always under the thumb of the rigid Godeschal, till\ndinner. The dinner was that of his master,--one dish of meat, one of\nvegetables, and a salad. The dessert consisted of a piece of Gruyere\ncheese. After dinner, Godeschal and Oscar returned to the office and\nworked till night. Once a month Oscar went to breakfast with his uncle\nCardot, and he spent the Sundays with his mother. From time to time\nMoreau, when he came to the office about his own affairs, would take\nOscar to dine in the Palais-Royal, and to some theatre in the evening.\nOscar had been so snubbed by Godeschal and by Desroches for his attempts\nat elegance that he no longer gave a thought to his clothes.\n\n\"A good clerk,\" Godeschal told him, \"should have two black coats, one\nnew, one old, a pair of black trousers, black stockings, and shoes.\nBoots cost too much. You can't have boots till you are called to the\nbar. A clerk should never spend more than seven hundred francs a year.\nGood stout shirts of strong linen are what you want. Ha! when a man\nstarts from nothing to reach fortune, he has to keep down to bare\nnecessities. Look at Monsieur Desroches; he did what we are doing, and\nsee where he is now.\"\n\nGodeschal preached by example. If he professed the strictest principles\nof honor, discretion, and honesty, he practised them without assumption,\nas he walked, as he breathed; such action was the natural play of his\nsoul, as walking and breathing were the natural play of his organs.\nEighteen months after Oscar's installation into the office, the second\nclerk was, for the second time, slightly wrong in his accounts, which\nwere comparatively unimportant. Godeschal said to him in presence of all\nthe other clerks:\n\n\"My dear Gaudet, go away from here of your own free will, that it may\nnot be said that Monsieur Desroches has dismissed you. You have been\ncareless or absent-minded, and neither of those defects can pass here.\nThe master shall know nothing about the matter; that is all that I can\ndo for a comrade.\"\n\nAt twenty years of age, Oscar became third clerk in the office. Though\nhe earned no salary, he was lodged and fed, for he did the work of the\nsecond clerk. Desroches employed two chief clerks, and the work of\nthe second was unremitting toil. By the end of his second year in the\nlaw-school Oscar knew more than most licensed graduates; he did the\nwork at the Palais intelligently, and argued some cases in chambers.\nGodeschal and Desroches were satisfied with him. And yet, though he now\nseemed a sensible man, he showed, from time to time, a hankering after\npleasure and a desire to shine, repressed, though it was, by the stern\ndiscipline and continual toil of his life.\n\nMoreau, satisfied with Oscar's progress, relaxed, in some degree, his\nwatchfulness; and when, in July, 1825, Oscar passed his examinations\nwith a spotless record, the land-agent gave him the money to dress\nhimself elegantly. Madame Clapart, proud and happy in her son, prepared\nthe outfit splendidly for the rising lawyer.\n\nIn the month of November, when the courts reopened, Oscar Husson\noccupied the chamber of the second clerk, whose work he now did\nwholly. He had a salary of eight hundred francs with board and lodging.\nConsequently, uncle Cardot, who went privately to Desroches and made\ninquiries about his nephew, promised Madame Clapart to be on the lookout\nfor a practice for Oscar, if he continued to do as well in the future.\n\nIn spite of these virtuous appearances, Oscar Husson was undergoing a\ngreat strife in his inmost being. At times he thought of quitting a\nlife so directly against his tastes and his nature. He felt that\ngalley-slaves were happier than he. Galled by the collar of this iron\nsystem, wild desires seized him to fly when he compared himself in the\nstreet with the well-dressed young men whom he met. Sometimes he was\ndriven by a sort of madness towards women; then, again, he resigned\nhimself, but only to fall into a deeper disgust for life. Impelled by\nthe example of Godeschal, he was forced, rather than led of himself, to\nremain in that rugged way.\n\nGodeschal, who watched and took note of Oscar, made it a matter of\nprinciple not to allow his pupil to be exposed to temptation. Generally\nthe young clerk was without money, or had so little that he could\nnot, if he would, give way to excess. During the last year, the worthy\nGodeschal had made five or six parties of pleasure with Oscar, defraying\nthe expenses, for he felt that the rope by which he tethered the young\nkid must be slackened. These \"pranks,\" as he called them, helped Oscar\nto endure existence, for there was little amusement in breakfasting with\nhis uncle Cardot, and still less in going to see his mother, who lived\neven more penuriously than Desroches. Moreau could not make himself\nfamiliar with Oscar as Godeschal could; and perhaps that sincere friend\nto young Husson was behind Godeschal in these efforts to initiate the\npoor youth safely into the mysteries of life. Oscar, grown prudent, had\ncome, through contact with others, to see the extent and the character\nof the fault he had committed on that luckless journey; but the volume\nof his repressed fancies and the follies of youth might still get the\nbetter of him. Nevertheless, the more knowledge he could get of the\nworld and its laws, the better his mind would form itself, and, provided\nGodeschal never lost sight of him, Moreau flattered himself that between\nthem they could bring the son of Madame Clapart through in safety.\n\n\"How is he getting on?\" asked the land-agent of Godeschal on his return\nfrom one of his journeys which had kept him some months out of Paris.\n\n\"Always too much vanity,\" replied Godeschal. \"You give him fine clothes\nand fine linen, he wears the shirt-fronts of a stockbroker, and so my\ndainty coxcomb spends his Sundays in the Tuileries, looking out for\nadventures. What else can you expect? That's youth. He torments me\nto present him to my sister, where he would see a pretty sort of\nsociety!--actresses, ballet-dancers, elegant young fops, spendthrifts\nwho are wasting their fortunes! His mind, I'm afraid, is not fitted for\nlaw. He can talk well, though; and if we could make him a barrister he\nmight plead cases that were carefully prepared for him.\"\n\nIn the month of November, 1825, soon after Oscar Husson had taken\npossession of his new clerkship, and at the moment when he was about to\npass his examination for the licentiate's degree, a new clerk arrived to\ntake the place made vacant by Oscar's promotion.\n\nThis fourth clerk, named Frederic Marest, intended to enter the\nmagistracy, and was now in his third year at the law school. He was a\nfine young man of twenty-three, enriched to the amount of some twelve\nthousand francs a year by the death of a bachelor uncle, and the son\nof Madame Marest, widow of the wealthy wood-merchant. This future\nmagistrate, actuated by a laudable desire to understand his vocation\nin its smallest details, had put himself in Desroches' office for the\npurpose of studying legal procedure, and of training himself to take a\nplace as head-clerk in two years. He hoped to do his \"stage\" (the period\nbetween the admission as licentiate and the call to the bar) in Paris,\nin order to be fully prepared for the functions of a post which would\nsurely not be refused to a rich young man. To see himself, by the time\nhe was thirty, \"procureur du roi\" in any court, no matter where, was\nhis sole ambition. Though Frederic Marest was cousin-german to Georges\nMarest, the latter not having told his surname in Pierrotin's coucou,\nOscar Husson did not connect the present Marest with the grandson of\nCzerni-Georges.\n\n\"Messieurs,\" said Godeschal at breakfast time, addressing all the\nclerks, \"I announce to you the arrival of a new jurisconsult; and as\nhe is rich, rishissime, we will make him, I hope, pay a glorious\nentrance-fee.\"\n\n\"Forward, the book!\" cried Oscar, nodding to the youngest clerk, \"and\npray let us be serious.\"\n\nThe youngest clerk climbed like a squirrel along the shelves which lined\nthe room, until he could reach a register placed on the top shelf, where\na thick layer of dust had settled on it.\n\n\"It is getting colored,\" said the little clerk, exhibiting the volume.\n\nWe must explain the perennial joke of this book, then much in vogue in\nlegal offices. In a clerical life where work is the rule, amusement is\nall the more treasured because it is rare; but, above all, a hoax or a\npractical joke is enjoyed with delight. This fancy or custom does, to\na certain extent, explain Georges Marest's behavior in the coucou. The\ngravest and most gloomy clerk is possessed, at times, with a craving\nfor fun and quizzing. The instinct with which a set of young clerks will\nseize and develop a hoax or a practical joke is really marvellous.\nThe denizens of a studio and of a lawyer's office are, in this line,\nsuperior to comedians.\n\nIn buying a practice without clients, Desroches began, as it were, a new\ndynasty. This circumstance made a break in the usages relative to the\nreception of new-comers. Moreover, Desroches having taken an office\nwhere legal documents had never yet been scribbled, had bought new\ntables, and white boxes edged with blue, also new. His staff was made\nup of clerks coming from other officers, without mutual ties, and\nsurprised, as one may say, to find themselves together. Godeschal, who\nhad served his apprenticeship under Maitre Derville, was not the sort of\nclerk to allow the precious tradition of the \"welcome\" to be lost.\nThis \"welcome\" is a breakfast which every neophyte must give to the\n\"ancients\" of the office into which he enters.\n\nNow, about the time when Oscar came to the office, during the first six\nmonths of Desroches' installation, on a winter evening when the work had\nbeen got through more quickly than usual, and the clerks were warming\nthemselves before the fire preparatory to departure, it came\ninto Godeschal's head to construct and compose a Register\n\"architriclino-basochien,\" of the utmost antiquity, saved from the\nfires of the Revolution, and derived through the procureur of the\nChatelet-Bordin, the immediate predecessor of Sauvaguest, the attorney,\nfrom whom Desroches had bought his practice. The work, which was highly\napproved by the other clerks, was begun by a search through all the\ndealers in old paper for a register, made of paper with the mark of\nthe eighteenth century, duly bound in parchment, on which should be the\nstamp of an order in council. Having found such a volume it was left\nabout in the dust, on the stove, on the ground, in the kitchen, and even\nin what the clerks called the \"chamber of deliberations\"; and thus\nit obtained a mouldiness to delight an antiquary, cracks of aged\ndilapidation, and broken corners that looked as though the rats had\ngnawed them; also, the gilt edges were tarnished with surprising\nperfection. As soon as the book was duly prepared, the entries were\nmade. The following extracts will show to the most obtuse mind the\npurpose to which the office of Maitre Desroches devoted this register,\nthe first sixty pages of which were filled with reports of fictitious\ncases. On the first page appeared as follows, in the legal spelling of\nthe eighteenth century:--\n\n  In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, so be it. This\n  day, the feast of our lady Saincte-Geneviesve, patron saint of\n  Paris, under whose protection have existed, since the year 1525\n  the clerks of this Practice, we the under-signed, clerks and\n  sub-clerks of Maistre Jerosme-Sebastien Bordin, successor to the\n  late Guerbet, in his lifetime procureur at the Chastelet, do hereby\n  recognize the obligation under which we lie to renew and continue\n  the register and the archives of installation of the clerks of\n  this noble Practice, a glorious member of the Kingdom of Basoche,\n  the which register, being now full in consequence of the many acts\n  and deeds of our well-beloved predecessors, we have consigned to\n  the Keeper of the Archives of the Palais for safe-keeping, with\n  the registers of other ancient Practices; and we have ourselves\n  gone, each and all, to hear mass at the parish church of\n  Saint-Severin to solemnize the inauguration of this our new\n  register.\n\n  In witness whereof we have hereunto signed our names: Malin,\n  head-clerk; Grevin, second-clerk; Athanase Feret, clerk; Jacques\n  Heret, clerk; Regnault de Saint-Jean-d'Angely, clerk; Bedeau,\n  youngest clerk and gutter-jumper.\n\n  In the year of our Lord 1787.\n\n  After the mass aforesaid was heard, we conveyed ourselves to\n  Courtille, where, at the common charge, we ordered a fine\n  breakfast; which did not end till seven o'clock the next morning.\n\nThis was marvellously well engrossed. An expert would have said that\nit was written in the eighteenth century. Twenty-seven reports of\nreceptions of neophytes followed, the last in the fatal year of 1792.\nThen came a blank of fourteen years; after which the register began\nagain, in 1806, with the appointment of Bordin as attorney before the\nfirst Court of the Seine. And here follows the deed which proclaimed the\nreconstitution of the kingdom of Basoche:--\n\n  God in his mercy willed that, in spite of the fearful storms which\n  have cruelly ravaged the land of France, now become a great\n  Empire, the archives of the very celebrated Practice of Maitre\n  Bordin should be preserved; and we, the undersigned, clerks of the\n  very virtuous and very worthy Maitre Bordin, do not hesitate to\n  attribute this unheard-of preservation, when all titles,\n  privileges, and charters were lost, to the protection of\n  Sainte-Genevieve, patron Saint of this office, and also to the\n  reverence which the last of the procureurs of noble race had for\n  all that belonged to ancient usages and customs. In the uncertainty\n  of knowing the exact part of Sainte-Genevieve and Maitre Bordin in\n  this miracle, we have resolved, each of us, to go to Saint-Etienne\n  du Mont and there hear mass, which will be said before the altar\n  of that Holy-Shepherdess who sends us sheep to shear, and also to\n  offer a breakfast to our master Bordin, hoping that he will pay\n  the costs.\n\n  Signed: Oignard, first clerk; Poidevin, second clerk; Proust,\n  clerk; Augustin Coret, sub-clerk.\n\n  At the office.\n\n  November, 1806.\n\n  At three in the afternoon, the above-named clerks hereby return\n  their grateful thanks to their excellent master, who regaled them\n  at the establishment of the Sieur Rolland restaurateur, rue du\n  Hasard, with exquisite wines of three regions, to wit: Bordeaux,\n  Champagne, and Burgundy, also with dishes most carefully chosen,\n  between the hours of four in the afternoon to half-past seven in\n  the evening. Coffee, ices, and liqueurs were in abundance. But\n  the presence of the master himself forbade the chanting of hymns\n  of praise in clerical stanzas. No clerk exceeded the bounds of\n  amiable gayety, for the worthy, respectable, and generous patron\n  had promised to take his clerks to see Talma in \"Brittanicus,\" at\n  the Theatre-Francais. Long life to Maitre Bordin! May God shed\n  favors on his venerable pow! May he sell dear so glorious a\n  practice! May the rich clients for whom he prays arrive! May his\n  bills of costs and charges be paid in a trice! May our masters to\n  come be like him! May he ever be loved by clerks in other worlds\n  than this!\n\nHere followed thirty-three reports of various receptions of new clerks,\ndistinguished from one another by different writing and different inks,\nalso by quotations, signatures, and praises of good cheer and wines,\nwhich seemed to show that each report was written and signed on the\nspot, \"inter pocula.\"\n\nFinally, under date of the month of June, 1822, the period when\nDesroches took the oath, appears this constitutional declaration:--\n\n  I, the undersigned, Francois-Claude-Marie Godeschal, called by\n  Maitre Desroches to perform the difficult functions of head-clerk\n  in a Practice where the clients have to be created, having learned\n  through Maitre Derville, from whose office I come, of the\n  existence of the famous archives architriclino-basochien, so\n  celebrated at the Palais, have implored our gracious master to\n  obtain them from his predecessor; for it has become of the highest\n  importance to recover a document bearing date of the year 1786,\n  which is connected with other documents deposited for safe-keeping\n  at the Palais, the existence of which has been certified to by\n  Messrs. Terrasse and Duclos, keepers of records, by the help of\n  which we may go back to the year 1525, and find historical\n  indications of the utmost value on the manners, customs, and\n  cookery of the clerical race.\n\n  Having received a favorable answer to this request, the present\n  office has this day been put in possession of these proofs of the\n  worship in which our predecessors held the Goddess Bottle and good\n  living.\n\n  In consequence thereof, for the edification of our successors, and\n  to renew the chain of years and goblets, I, the said Godeschal,\n  have invited Messieurs Doublet, second clerk; Vassal, third clerk;\n  Herisson and Grandemain, clerks; and Dumets, sub-clerk, to\n  breakfast, Sunday next, at the \"Cheval Rouge,\" on the Quai\n  Saint-Bernard, where we will celebrate the victory of obtaining\n  this volume which contains the Charter of our gullets.\n\n  This day, Sunday, June 27th, were imbibed twelve bottles of twelve\n  different wines, regarded as exquisite; also were devoured melons,\n  \"pates au jus romanum,\" and a fillet of beef with mushroom sauce.\n  Mademoiselle Mariette, the illustrious sister of our head-clerk\n  and leading lady of the Royal Academy of music and dancing, having\n  obligingly put at the disposition of this Practice orchestra seats\n  for the performance of this evening, it is proper to make this\n  record of her generosity. Moreover, it is hereby decreed that the\n  aforesaid clerks shall convey themselves in a body to that noble\n  demoiselle to thank her in person, and declare to her that on the\n  occasion of her first lawsuit, if the devil sends her one, she\n  shall pay the money laid out upon it, and no more.\n\n  And our head-clerk Godeschal has been and is hereby proclaimed a\n  flower of Basoche, and, more especially, a good fellow. May a man\n  who treats so well be soon in treaty for a Practice of his own!\n\nOn this record were stains of wine, pates, and candle-grease. To exhibit\nthe stamp of truth that the writers had managed to put upon these\nrecords, we may here give the report of Oscar's own pretended\nreception:--\n\n  This day, Monday, November 25th, 1822, after a session held\n  yesterday at the rue de la Cerisaie, Arsenal quarter, at the house\n  of Madame Clapart, mother of the candidate-basochien Oscar Husson,\n  we, the undersigned, declare that the repast of admission\n  surpassed our expectations. It was composed of radishes, pink and\n  black, gherkins, anchovies, butter and olives for hors-d'oeuvre; a\n  succulent soup of rice, bearing testimony to maternal solicitude,\n  for we recognized therein a delicious taste of poultry; indeed, by\n  acknowledgment of the new member, we learned that the gibbets of a\n  fine stew prepared by the hands of Madame Clapart herself had been\n  judiciously inserted into the family soup-pot with a care that is\n  never taken except in such households.\n\n  Item: the said gibbets inclosed in a sea of jelly.\n\n  Item: a tongue of beef with tomatoes, which rendered us all\n  tongue-tied automatoes.\n\n  Item: a compote of pigeons with caused us to think the angels had\n  had a finger in it.\n\n  Item: a timbale of macaroni surrounded by chocolate custards.\n\n  Item: a dessert composed of eleven delicate dishes, among which we\n  remarked (in spite of the tipsiness caused by sixteen bottles of\n  the choicest wines) a compote of peaches of august and mirobolant\n  delicacy.\n\n  The wines of Roussillon and those of the banks of the Rhone\n  completely effaced those of Champagne and Burgundy. A bottle of\n  maraschino and another of kirsch did, in spite of the exquisite\n  coffee, plunge us into so marked an oenological ecstasy that we\n  found ourselves at a late hour in the Bois de Boulogne instead of\n  our domicile, where we thought we were.\n\n  In the statutes of our Order there is one rule which is rigidly\n  enforced; namely, to allow all candidates for the privilege of\n  Basoche to limit the magnificence of their feast of welcome to the\n  length of their purse; for it is publicly notorious that no one\n  delivers himself up to Themis if he has a fortune, and every clerk\n  is, alas, sternly curtailed by his parents. Consequently, we\n  hereby record with the highest praise the liberal conduct of\n  Madame Clapart, widow, by her first marriage, of Monsieur Husson,\n  father of the candidate, who is worthy of the hurrahs which we\n  gave for her at dessert.\n\n  To all of which we hereby set our hands.\n\n  [Signed by all the clerks.]\n\nThree clerks had already been deceived by the Book, and three real\n\"receptions of welcome,\" were recorded on this imposing register.\n\nThe day after the arrival of each neophyte, the little sub-clerk (the\nerrand-boy and \"gutter-jumper\") laid upon the new-comer's desk the\n\"Archives Architriclino-Basochiennes,\" and the clerks enjoyed the sight\nof his countenance as he studied its facetious pages. Inter pocula\neach candidate had learned the secret of the farce, and the revelation\ninspired him with the desire to hoax his successor.\n\nWe see now why Oscar, become in his turn participator in the hoax,\ncalled out to the little clerk, \"Forward, the book!\"\n\nTen minutes later a handsome young man, with a fine figure and pleasant\nface, presented himself, asked for Monsieur Desroches, and gave his name\nwithout hesitation to Godeschal.\n\n\"I am Frederic Marest,\" he said, \"and I come to take the place of third\nclerk.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Husson,\" said Godeschal to Oscar, \"show monsieur his seat and\ntell him about the customs of the office.\"\n\nThe next day the new clerk found the register lying on his desk. He took\nit up, but after reading a few pages he began to laugh, said nothing to\nthe assembled clerks, and laid the book down again.\n\n\"Messieurs,\" he said, when the hour of departure came at five o'clock,\n\"I have a cousin who is head clerk of the notary Maitre Leopold\nHannequin; I will ask his advice as to what I ought to do for my\nwelcome.\"\n\n\"That looks ill,\" cried Godeschal, when Frederic had gone, \"he hasn't\nthe cut of a novice, that fellow!\"\n\n\"We'll get some fun out of him yet,\" said Oscar.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX, LA MARQUISE DE LAS FLORENTINAS Y CABIROLOS\n\n\nThe following day, at two o'clock, a young man entered the office,\nwhom Oscar recognized as Georges Marest, now head-clerk of the notary\nHannequin.\n\n\"Ha! here's the friend of Ali pacha!\" he exclaimed in a flippant way.\n\n\"Hey! you here, Monsieur l'ambassadeur!\" returned Georges, recollecting\nOscar.\n\n\"So you know each other?\" said Godeschal, addressing Georges.\n\n\"I should think so! We got into a scrape together,\" replied Georges,\n\"about two years ago. Yes, I had to leave Crottat and go to Hannequin in\nconsequence of that affair.\"\n\n\"What was it?\" asked Godeschal.\n\n\"Oh, nothing!\" replied Georges, at a sign from Oscar. \"We tried to hoax\na peer of France, and he bowled us over. Ah ca! so you want to jockey my\ncousin, do you?\"\n\n\"We jockey no one,\" replied Oscar, with dignity; \"there's our charter.\"\n\nAnd he presented the famous register, pointing to a place where sentence\nof banishment was passed on a refractory who was stated to have been\nforced, for acts of dishonesty, to leave the office in 1788.\n\nGeorges laughed as he looked through the archives.\n\n\"Well, well,\" he said, \"my cousin and I are rich, and we'll give you\na fete such as you never had before,--something to stimulate your\nimaginations for that register. To-morrow (Sunday) you are bidden to the\nRocher de Cancale at two o'clock. Afterwards, I'll take you to spend the\nevening with Madame la Marquise de las Florentinas y Cabirolos, where\nwe shall play cards, and you'll see the elite of the women of fashion.\nTherefore, gentleman of the lower courts,\" he added, with notarial\nassumption, \"you will have to behave yourselves, and carry your wine\nlike the seigneurs of the Regency.\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried the office like one man. \"Bravo! very well! vivat! Long\nlive the Marests!\"\n\n\"What's all this about?\" asked Desroches, coming out from his private\noffice. \"Ah! is that you, Georges? I know what you are after; you want\nto demoralize my clerks.\"\n\nSo saying, he withdrew into his own room, calling Oscar after him.\n\n\"Here,\" he said, opening his cash-box, \"are five hundred francs. Go\nto the Palais, and get from the registrar a copy of the decision in\nVandernesse against Vandernesse; it must be served to-night if possible.\nI have promised a PROD of twenty francs to Simon. Wait for the copy if\nit is not ready. Above all, don't let yourself be fooled; for Derville\nis capable, in the interest of his clients, to stick a spoke in our\nwheel. Count Felix de Vandernesse is more powerful than his brother, our\nclient, the ambassador. Therefore keep your eyes open, and if there's\nthe slightest hitch come back to me at once.\"\n\nOscar departed with the full intention of distinguishing himself in\nthis little skirmish,--the first affair entrusted to him since his\ninstallation as second clerk.\n\nAfter the departure of Georges and Oscar, Godeschal sounded the new\nclerk to discover the joke which, as he thought, lay behind this\nMarquise de las Florentinas y Cabirolos. But Frederic, with the coolness\nand gravity of a king's attorney, continued his cousin's hoax, and by\nhis way of answering, and his manner generally, he succeeded in making\nthe office believe that the marquise might really be the widow of a\nSpanish grandee, to whom his cousin Georges was paying his addresses.\nBorn in Mexico, and the daughter of Creole parents, this young and\nwealthy widow was noted for the easy manners and habits of the women of\nthose climates.\n\n\"She loves to laugh, she loves to sing, she loves to drink like me!\" he\nsaid in a low voice, quoting the well-known song of Beranger. \"Georges,\"\nhe added, \"is very rich; he has inherited from his father (who was a\nwidower) eighteen thousand francs a year, and with the twelve thousand\nwhich an uncle has just left to each of us, he has an income of thirty\nthousand. So he pays his debts, and gives up the law. He hopes to be\nMarquis de las Florentinas, for the young widow is marquise in her own\nright, and has the privilege of giving her titles to her husband.\"\n\nThough the clerks were still a good deal undecided in mind as to the\nmarquise, the double perspective of a breakfast at the Rocher de Cancale\nand a fashionable festivity put them into a state of joyous expectation.\nThey reserved all points as to the Spanish lady, intending to judge her\nwithout appeal after the meeting.\n\nThe Marquise de las Florentinas y Cabirolos was neither more nor less\nthan Mademoiselle Agathe-Florentine Cabirolle, first danseuse at\nthe Gaiete, with whom uncle Cardot was in the habit of singing \"Mere\nGodichon.\" A year after the very reparable loss of Madame Cardot, the\nsuccessful merchant encountered Florentine as she was leaving Coulon's\ndancing-class. Attracted by the beauty of that choregraphic flower\n(Florentine was then about thirteen years of age), he followed her to\nthe rue Pastourel, where he found that the future star of the ballet was\nthe daughter of a portress. Two weeks later, the mother and daughter,\nestablished in the rue de Crussol, were enjoying a modest competence. It\nwas to this protector of the arts--to use the consecrated phrase--that\nthe theatre owed the brilliant danseuse. The generous Maecenas made two\nbeings almost beside themselves with joy in the possession of mahogany\nfurniture, hangings, carpets, and a regular kitchen; he allowed them a\nwoman-of-all-work, and gave them two hundred and fifty francs a month\nfor their living. Pere Cardot, with his hair in \"pigeon-wings,\" seemed\nlike an angel, and was treated with the attention due to a benefactor.\nTo him this was the age of gold.\n\nFor three years the warbler of \"Mere Godichon\" had the wise policy to\nkeep Mademoiselle Cabirolle and her mother in this little apartment,\nwhich was only ten steps from the theatre; but he gave the girl, out of\nlove for the choregraphic art, the great Vestris for a master. In 1820\nhe had the pleasure of seeing Florentine dance her first \"pas\" in the\nballet of a melodrama entitled \"The Ruins of Babylon.\" Florentine was\nthen about sixteen. Shortly after this debut Pere Cardot became an \"old\nscrew\" in the eyes of his protegee; but as he had the sense to see that\na danseuse at the Gaiete had a certain rank to maintain, he raised the\nmonthly stipend to five hundred francs, for which, although he did not\nagain become an angel, he was, at least, a \"friend for life,\" a second\nfather. This was his silver age.\n\nFrom 1820 to 1823, Florentine had the experience of every danseuse\nof nineteen to twenty years of age. Her friends were the illustrious\nMariette and Tullia, leading ladies of the Opera, Florine, and also poor\nCoralie, torn too early from the arts, and love, and Camusot. As old\nCardot had by this time acquired five additional years, he had fallen\ninto the indulgence of a semi-paternity, which is the way with old men\ntowards the young talents they have trained, and which owe their success\nto them. Besides, where could he have found another Florentine who knew\nall his habits and likings, and with whom he and his friends could sing\n\"Mere Godichon\"? So the little old man remained under a yoke that was\nsemi-conjugal and also irresistibly strong. This was the brass age for\nthe old fellow.\n\nDuring the five years of silver and gold Pere Cardot had laid by eighty\nthousand francs. The old gentleman, wise from experience, foresaw that\nby the time he was seventy Florentine would be of age, probably engaged\nat the Opera, and, consequently, wanting all the luxury of a theatrical\nstar. Some days before the party mentioned by Georges, Pere Cardot\nhad spent the sum of forty-five thousand francs in fitting up for his\nFlorentine the former apartment of the late Coralie. In Paris there\nare suites of rooms as well as houses and streets that have their\npredestinations. Enriched with a magnificent service of plate, the\n\"prima danseuse\" of the Gaiete began to give dinners, spent three\nhundred francs a month on her dress, never went out except in a hired\ncarriage, and had a maid for herself, a cook, and a little footman.\n\nIn fact, an engagement at the Opera was already in the wind. The\nCocon d'Or did homage to its first master by sending its most splendid\nproducts for the gratification of Mademoiselle Cabirolle, now called\nFlorentine. The magnificence which suddenly burst upon her apartment\nin the rue de Vendome would have satisfied the most ambitious\nsupernumerary. After being the master of the ship for seven years,\nCardot now found himself towed along by a force of unlimited caprice.\nBut the luckless old gentleman was fond of his tyrant. Florentine was\nto close his eyes; he meant to leave her a hundred thousand francs. The\niron age had now begun.\n\nGeorges Marest, with thirty thousand francs a year, and a handsome face,\ncourted Florentine. Every danseuse makes a point of having some young\nman who will take her to drive, and arrange the gay excursions into the\ncountry which all such women delight in. However disinterested she may\nbe, the courtship of such a star is a passion which costs some trifles\nto the favored mortal. There are dinners at restaurants, boxes at the\ntheatres, carriages to go to the environs and return, choice wines\nconsumed in profusion,--for an opera danseuse eats and drinks like an\nathlete. Georges amused himself like other young men who pass at a jump\nfrom paternal discipline to a rich independence, and the death of his\nuncle, nearly doubling his means, had still further enlarged his ideas.\nAs long as he had only his patrimony of eighteen thousand francs a year,\nhis intention was to become a notary, but (as his cousin remarked to the\nclerks of Desroches) a man must be stupid who begins a profession with\nthe fortune most men hope to acquire in order to leave it. Wiser then\nGeorges, Frederic persisted in following the career of public office,\nand of putting himself, as we have seen, in training for it.\n\nA young man as handsome and attractive as Georges might very well aspire\nto the hand of a rich creole; and the clerks in Desroches' office, all\nof them the sons of poor parents, having never frequented the great\nworld, or, indeed, known anything about it, put themselves into their\nbest clothes on the following day, impatient enough to behold, and be\npresented to the Mexican Marquise de las Florentinas y Cabirolos.\n\n\"What luck,\" said Oscar to Godeschal, as they were getting up in the\nmorning, \"that I had just ordered a new coat and trousers and waistcoat,\nand that my dear mother had made me that fine outfit! I have six frilled\nshirts of fine linen in the dozen she made for me. We shall make an\nappearance! Ha! ha! suppose one of us were to carry off the Creole\nmarchioness from that Georges Marest!\"\n\n\"Fine occupation that, for a clerk in our office!\" cried Godeschal.\n\"Will you never control your vanity, popinjay?\"\n\n\"Ah! monsieur,\" said Madame Clapart, who entered the room at that\nmoment to bring her son some cravats, and overhead the last words of the\nhead-clerk, \"would to God that my Oscar might always follow your advice.\nIt is what I tell him all the time: 'Imitate Monsieur Godeschal; listen\nto what he tells you.'\"\n\n\"He'll go all right, madame,\" interposed Godeschal, \"but he mustn't\ncommit any more blunders like one he was guilty of last night, or he'll\nlose the confidence of the master. Monsieur Desroches won't stand any\none not succeeding in what he tells them to do. He ordered your son,\nfor a first employment in his new clerkship, to get a copy of a judgment\nwhich ought to have been served last evening, and Oscar, instead of\ndoing so, allowed himself to be fooled. The master was furious. It's a\nchance if I have been able to repair the mischief by going this morning,\nat six o'clock, to see the head-clerk at the Palais, who has promised me\nto have a copy ready by seven o'clock to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Ah, Godeschal!\" cried Oscar, going up to him and pressing his hand.\n\"You are, indeed, a true friend.\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur!\" said Madame Clapart, \"a mother is happy, indeed,\nin knowing that her son has a friend like you; you may rely upon a\ngratitude which can end only with my life. Oscar, one thing I want to\nsay to you now. Distrust that Georges Marest. I wish you had never met\nhim again, for he was the cause of your first great misfortune in life.\"\n\n\"Was he? How so?\" asked Godeschal.\n\nThe too devoted mother explained succinctly the adventure of her poor\nOscar in Pierrotin's coucou.\n\n\"I am certain,\" said Godeschal, \"that that blagueur is preparing some\ntrick against us for this evening. As for me, I can't go to the Marquise\nde las Florentinas' party, for my sister wants me to draw up the terms\nof her new engagement; I shall have to leave after the dessert. But,\nOscar, be on your guard. They will ask you to play, and, of course, the\nDesroches office mustn't draw back; but be careful. You shall play for\nboth of us; here's a hundred francs,\" said the good fellow, knowing that\nOscar's purse was dry from the demands of his tailor and bootmaker. \"Be\nprudent; remember not to play beyond that sum; and don't let yourself\nget tipsy, either with play or libations. Saperlotte! a second clerk is\nalready a man of weight, and shouldn't gamble on notes, or go beyond a\ncertain limit in anything. His business is to get himself admitted\nto the bar. Therefore don't drink too much, don't play too long, and\nmaintain a proper dignity,--that's your rule of conduct. Above all, get\nhome by midnight; for, remember, you must be at the Palais to-morrow\nmorning by seven to get that judgment. A man is not forbidden to amuse\nhimself, but business first, my boy.\"\n\n\"Do you hear that, Oscar?\" said Madame Clapart. \"Monsieur Godeschal is\nindulgent; see how well he knows how to combine the pleasures of youth\nand the duties of his calling.\"\n\nMadame Clapart, on the arrival of the tailor and the bootmaker with\nOscar's new clothes, remained alone with Godeschal, in order to return\nhim the hundred francs he had just given her son.\n\n\"Ah, monsieur!\" she said, \"the blessings of a mother will follow you\nwherever you go, and in all your enterprises.\"\n\nPoor woman! she now had the supreme delight of seeing her son\nwell-dressed, and she gave him a gold watch, the price of which she had\nsaved by economy, as the reward of his good conduct.\n\n\"You draw for the conscription next week,\" she said, \"and to prepare, in\ncase you get a bad number, I have been to see your uncle Cardot. He is\nvery much pleased with you; and so delighted to know you are a second\nclerk at twenty, and to hear of your successful examination at the\nlaw-school, that he promised me the money for a substitute. Are not you\nglad to think that your own good conduct has brought such reward? Though\nyou have some privations to bear, remember the happiness of being able,\nfive years from now, to buy a practice. And think, too, my dear little\nkitten, how happy you make your mother.\"\n\nOscar's face, somewhat thinned by study, had acquired, through habits\nof business, a serious expression. He had reached his full growth, his\nbeard was thriving; adolescence had given place to virility. The mother\ncould not refrain from admiring her son and kissing him, as she said:--\n\n\"Amuse yourself, my dear boy, but remember the advice of our good\nMonsieur Godeschal. Ah! by the bye, I was nearly forgetting! Here's a\npresent our friend Moreau sends you. See! what a pretty pocket-book.\"\n\n\"And I want it, too; for the master gave me five hundred francs to get\nthat cursed judgment of Vandernesse versus Vandernesse, and I don't want\nto leave that sum of money in my room.\"\n\n\"But, surely, you are not going to carry it with you!\" exclaimed his\nmother, in alarm. \"Suppose you should lose a sum like that! Hadn't you\nbetter give it to Monsieur Godeschal for safe keeping?\"\n\n\"Godeschal!\" cried Oscar, who thought his mother's suggestion excellent.\n\nBut Godeschal, who, like all clerks, has his time to himself on Sundays,\nfrom ten to two o'clock, had already departed.\n\nWhen his mother left him, Oscar went to lounge upon the boulevards until\nit was time to go to Georges Marest's breakfast. Why not display those\nbeautiful clothes which he wore with a pride and joy which all young\nfellows who have been pinched for means in their youth will remember. A\npretty waistcoat with a blue ground and a palm-leaf pattern, a pair of\nblack cashmere trousers pleated, a black coat very well fitting, and a\ncane with a gilt top, the cost of which he had saved himself, caused a\nnatural joy to the poor lad, who thought of his manner of dress on the\nday of that journey to Presles, as the effect that Georges had then\nproduced upon him came back to his mind.\n\nOscar had before him the perspective of a day of happiness; he was\nto see the gay world at last! Let us admit that a clerk deprived of\nenjoyments, though longing for dissipation, was likely to let his\nunchained senses drive the wise counsels of his mother and Godeschal\ncompletely out of his mind. To the shame of youth let it be added that\ngood advice is never lacking to it. In the matter of Georges, Oscar\nhimself had a feeling of aversion for him; he felt humiliated before a\nwitness of that scene in the salon at Presles when Moreau had flung\nhim at the count's feet. The moral senses have their laws, which are\nimplacable, and we are always punished for disregarding them. There is\none in particular, which the animals themselves obey without discussion,\nand invariably; it is that which tells us to avoid those who have once\ninjured us, with or without intention, voluntarily or involuntarily. The\ncreature from whom we receive either damage or annoyance will always be\ndispleasing to us. Whatever may be his rank or the degree of affection\nin which he stands to us, it is best to break away from him; for our\nevil genius has sent him to us. Though the Christian sentiment is\nopposed to it, obedience to this terrible law is essentially social and\nconservative. The daughter of James II., who seated herself upon\nher father's throne, must have caused him many a wound before that\nusurpation. Judas had certainly given some murderous blow to Jesus\nbefore he betrayed him. We have within us an inward power of sight, an\neye of the soul which foresees catastrophes; and the repugnance that\ncomes over us against the fateful being is the result of that foresight.\nThough religion orders us to conquer it, distrust remains, and its voice\nis forever heard. Would Oscar, at twenty years of age, have the wisdom\nto listen to it?\n\nAlas! when, at half-past two o'clock, Oscar entered the salon of the\nRocher de Cancale,--where were three invited persons besides the clerks,\nto wit: an old captain of dragoons, named Giroudeau; Finot, a journalist\nwho might procure an engagement for Florentine at the Opera, and du\nBruel, an author, the friend of Tullia, one of Mariette's rivals,--the\nsecond clerk felt his secret hostility vanish at the first handshaking,\nthe first dashes of conversation as they sat around a table luxuriously\nserved. Georges, moreover, made himself charming to Oscar.\n\n\"You've taken to private diplomacy,\" he said; \"for what difference is\nthere between a lawyer and an ambassador? only that between a nation and\nan individual. Ambassadors are the attorneys of Peoples. If I can ever\nbe useful to you, let me know.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Oscar, \"I'll admit to you now that you once did me a very\ngreat harm.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" said Georges, after listening to the explanation for which\nhe asked; \"it was Monsieur de Serizy who behaved badly. His wife!\nI wouldn't have her at any price; neither would I like to be in the\ncount's red skin, minister of State and peer of France as he is. He has\na small mind, and I don't care a fig for him now.\"\n\nOscar listened with true pleasure to these slurs on the count, for they\ndiminished, in a way, the importance of his fault; and he echoed the\nspiteful language of the ex-notary, who amused himself by predicting\nthe blows to the nobility of which the bourgeoisie were already\ndreaming,--blows which were destined to become a reality in 1830.\n\nAt half-past three the solid eating of the feast began; the dessert did\nnot appear till eight o'clock,--each course having taken two hours to\nserve. None but clerks can eat like that! The stomachs of eighteen and\ntwenty are inexplicable to the medical art. The wines were worthy of\nBorrel, who in those days had superseded the illustrious Balaine, the\ncreator of the first restaurant for delicate and perfectly prepared food\nin Paris,--that is to say, the whole world.\n\nThe report of this Belshazzar's feast for the architriclino-basochien\nregister was duly drawn up, beginning, \"Inter pocula aurea restauranti,\nqui vulgo dicitur Rupes Cancali.\" Every one can imagine the fine page\nnow added to the Golden Book of jurisprudential festivals.\n\nGodeschal disappeared after signing the report, leaving the eleven\nguests, stimulated by the old captain of the Imperial Guard, to the\nwines, toasts, and liqueurs of a dessert composed of choice and early\nfruits, in pyramids that rivalled the obelisk of Thebes. By half-past\nten the little sub-clerk was in such a state that Georges packed him\ninto a coach, paid his fare, and gave the address of his mother to the\ndriver. The remaining ten, all as drunk as Pitt and Dundas, talked of\ngoing on foot along the boulevards, considering the fine evening, to\nthe house of the Marquise de las Florentinas y Cabirolos, where, about\nmidnight, they might expect to find the most brilliant society of Paris.\nThey felt the need of breathing the pure air into their lungs; but,\nwith the exception of Georges, Giroudeau, du Bruel, and Finot, all\nfour accustomed to Parisian orgies, not one of the party could walk.\nConsequently, Georges sent to a livery-stable for three open carriages,\nin which he drove his company for an hour round the exterior boulevards\nfrom Monmartre to the Barriere du Trone. They returned by Bercy, the\nquays, and the boulevards to the rue de Vendome.\n\nThe clerks were fluttering still in the skies of fancy to which youth\nis lifted by intoxication, when their amphitryon introduced them into\nFlorentine's salon. There sparkled a bevy of stage princesses, who,\nhaving been informed, no doubt, of Frederic's joke, were amusing\nthemselves by imitating the women of good society. They were then\nengaged in eating ices. The wax-candles flamed in the candelabra.\nTullia's footmen and those of Madame du Val-Noble and Florine, all in\nfull livery, where serving the dainties on silver salvers. The hangings,\na marvel of Lyonnaise workmanship, fastened by gold cords, dazzled\nall eyes. The flowers of the carpet were like a garden. The richest\n\"bibelots\" and curiosities danced before the eyes of the new-comers.\n\nAt first, and in the state to which Georges had brought them, the\nclerks, and more particularly Oscar, believed in the Marquise de las\nFlorentinas y Cabirolos. Gold glittered on four card-tables in the\nbed-chamber. In the salon, the women were playing at vingt-et-un, kept\nby Nathan, the celebrated author.\n\nAfter wandering, tipsy and half asleep, through the dark exterior\nboulevards, the clerks now felt that they had wakened in the palace\nof Armida. Oscar, presented to the marquise by Georges, was quite\nstupefied, and did not recognize the danseuse he had seen at the Gaiete,\nin this lady, aristocratically decolletee and swathed in laces, till she\nlooked like the vignette of a keepsake, who received him with manners\nand graces the like of which was neither in the memory nor the\nimagination of a young clerk rigidly brought up. After admiring the\nsplendors of the apartment and the beautiful women there displayed, who\nhad all outdone each other in their dress for this occasion, Oscar was\ntaken by the hand and led by Florentine to a vingt-et-un table.\n\n\"Let me present you,\" she said, \"to the beautiful Marquise d'Anglade,\none of my nearest friends.\"\n\nAnd she took Oscar to the pretty Fanny Beaupre, who had just made\nherself a reputation at the Porte-Saint-Martin, in a melodrama entitled\n\"La Famille d'Anglade.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said Florentine, \"allow me to present to you a charming\nyouth, whom you can take as a partner in the game.\"\n\n\"Ah! that will be delightful,\" replied the actress, smiling, as she\nlooked at Oscar. \"I am losing. Shall we go shares, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Madame la marquise, I am at your orders,\" said Oscar, sitting down\nbeside her.\n\n\"Put down the money; I'll play; you shall being me luck! See, here are\nmy last hundred francs.\"\n\nAnd the \"marquise\" took out from her purse, the rings of which were\nadorned with diamonds, five gold pieces. Oscar pulled out his hundred in\nsilver five-franc pieces, much ashamed at having to mingle such ignoble\ncoins with gold. In ten throws the actress lost the two hundred francs.\n\n\"Oh! how stupid!\" she cried. \"I'm banker now. But we'll play together\nstill, won't we?\"\n\nFanny Beaupre rose to take her place as banker, and Oscar, finding\nhimself observed by the whole table, dared not retire on the ground that\nhe had no money. Speech failed him, and his tongue clove to the roof of\nhis mouth.\n\n\"Lend me five hundred francs,\" said the actress to the danseuse.\n\nFlorentine brought the money, which she obtained from Georges, who had\njust passed eight times at ecarte.\n\n\"Nathan has won twelve hundred francs,\" said the actress to Oscar.\n\"Bankers always win; we won't let them fool us, will we?\" she whispered\nin his ear.\n\nPersons of nerve, imagination, and dash will understand how it was that\npoor Oscar opened his pocket-book and took out the note of five\nhundred francs which Desroches had given him. He looked at Nathan, the\ndistinguished author, who now began, with Florine, to play a heavy game\nagainst the bank.\n\n\"Come, my little man, take 'em up,\" cried Fanny Beaupre, signing to\nOscar to rake in the two hundred francs which Nathan and Florine had\npunted.\n\nThe actress did not spare taunts or jests on those who lost. She\nenlivened the game with jokes which Oscar thought singular; but\nreflection was stifled by joy; for the first two throws produced a\ngain of two thousand francs. Oscar then thought of feigning illness and\nmaking his escape, leaving his partner behind him; but \"honor\" kept him\nthere. Three more turns and the gains were lost. Oscar felt a cold sweat\nrunning down his back, and he was sobered completely.\n\nThe next two throws carried off the thousand francs of their mutual\nstake. Oscar was consumed with thirst, and drank three glasses of iced\npunch one after the other. The actress now led him into the bed-chamber,\nwhere the rest of the company were playing, talking frivolities with an\neasy air. But by this time the sense of his wrong-doing overcame him;\nthe figure of Desroches appeared to him like a vision. He turned aside\nto a dark corner and sat down, putting his handkerchief to his eyes, and\nwept. Florentine noticed the attitude of true grief, which, because it\nis sincere, is certain to strike the eye of one who acts. She ran to\nhim, took the handkerchief from his hand, and saw his tears; then she\nled him into a boudoir alone.\n\n\"What is it, my child?\" she said.\n\nAt the tone and accent of that voice Oscar recognized a motherly\nkindness which is often found in women of her kind, and he answered\nopenly:--\n\n\"I have lost five hundred francs which my employer gave me to obtain a\ndocument to-morrow morning; there's nothing for me but to fling myself\ninto the river; I am dishonored.\"\n\n\"How silly you are!\" she said. \"Stay where you are; I'll get you a\nthousand francs and you can win back what you've lost; but don't risk\nmore than five hundred, so that you may be sure of your master's money.\nGeorges plays a fine game at ecarte; bet on him.\"\n\nOscar, frightened by his position, accepted the offer of the mistress of\nthe house.\n\n\"Ah!\" he thought, \"it is only women of rank who are capable of such\nkindness. Beautiful, noble, rich! how lucky Georges is!\"\n\nHe received the thousand francs from Florentine and returned to bet on\nhis hoaxer. Georges had just passed for the fourth time when Oscar sat\ndown beside him. The other players saw with satisfaction the arrival of\na new better; for all, with the instinct of gamblers, took the side of\nGiroudeau, the old officer of the Empire.\n\n\"Messieurs,\" said Georges, \"you'll be punished for deserting me; I feel\nin the vein. Come, Oscar, we'll make an end of them!\"\n\nGeorges and his partner lost five games running. After losing the\nthousand francs Oscar was seized with the fury of play and insisted on\ntaking the cards himself. By the result of a chance not at all uncommon\nwith those who play for the first time, he won. But Georges bewildered\nhim with advice; told him when to throw the cards, and even snatched\nthem from his hand; so that this conflict of wills and intuitions\ninjured his vein. By three o'clock in the morning, after various changes\nof fortune, and still drinking punch, Oscar came down to his last\nhundred francs. He rose with a heavy head, completely stupefied, took a\nfew steps forward, and fell upon a sofa in the boudoir, his eyes closing\nin a leaden sleep.\n\n\"Mariette,\" said Fanny Beaupre to Godeschal's sister, who had come in\nabout two o'clock, \"do you dine here to-morrow? Camusot and Pere Cardot\nare coming, and we'll have some fun.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Florentine, \"and my old fellow never told me!\"\n\n\"He said he'd tell you to-morrow morning,\" remarked Fanny Beaupre.\n\n\"The devil take him and his orgies!\" exclaimed Florentine. \"He and\nCamusot are worse than magistrates or stage-managers. But we have very\ngood dinners here, Mariette,\" she continued. \"Cardot always orders them\nfrom Chevet's; bring your Duc de Maufrigneuse and we'll make them dance\nlike Tritons.\"\n\nHearing the names of Cardot and Camusot, Oscar made an effort to throw\noff his sleep; but he could only mutter a few words which were not\nunderstood, and then he fell back upon the silken cushions.\n\n\"You'll have to keep him here all night,\" said Fanny Beaupre, laughing,\nto Florentine.\n\n\"Oh! poor boy! he is drunk with punch and despair both. It is the second\nclerk in your brother's office,\" she said to Mariette. \"He has lost\nthe money his master gave him for some legal affair. He wanted to drown\nhimself; so I lent him a thousand francs, but those brigands Finot and\nGiroudeau won them from him. Poor innocent!\"\n\n\"But we ought to wake him,\" said Mariette. \"My brother won't make light\nof it, nor his master either.\"\n\n\"Oh, wake him if you can, and carry him off with you!\" said Florentine,\nreturning to the salon to receive the adieux of some departing guests.\n\nPresently those who remained began what was called \"character dancing,\"\nand by the time it was broad daylight, Florentine, tired out, went to\nbed, oblivious to Oscar, who was still in the boudoir sound asleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. ANOTHER CATASTROPHE\n\n\nAbout eleven the next morning, a terrible sound awoke the unfortunate\nclerk. Recognizing the voice of his uncle Cardot, he thought it wise to\nfeign sleep, and so turned his face into the yellow velvet cushions on\nwhich he had passed the night.\n\n\"Really, my little Florentine,\" said the old gentleman, \"this is neither\nright nor sensible; you danced last evening in 'Les Ruines,' and you\nhave spent the night in an orgy. That's deliberately going to work to\nlose your freshness. Besides which, it was ungrateful to inaugurate this\nbeautiful apartment without even letting me know. Who knows what has\nbeen going on here?\"\n\n\"Old monster!\" cried Florentine, \"haven't you a key that lets you in\nat all hours? My ball lasted till five in the morning, and you have the\ncruelty to come and wake me up at eleven!\"\n\n\"Half-past eleven, Titine,\" observed Cardot, humbly. \"I came out early\nto order a dinner fit for an archbishop at Chevet's. Just see how the\ncarpets are stained! What sort of people did you have here?\"\n\n\"You needn't complain, for Fanny Beaupre told me you were coming to\ndinner with Camusot, and to please you I've invited Tullia, du Bruel,\nMariette, the Duc de Maufrigneuse, Florine, and Nathan. So you'll have\nthe four loveliest creatures ever seen behind the foot-lights; we'll\ndance you a 'pas de Zephire.'\"\n\n\"It is enough to kill you to lead such a life!\" cried old Cardot; \"and\nlook at the broken glasses! What pillage! The antechamber actually makes\nme shudder--\"\n\nAt this instant the wrathful old gentleman stopped short as if\nmagnetized, like a bird which a snake is charming. He saw the outline of\na form in a black coat through the door of the boudoir.\n\n\"Ah, Mademoiselle Cabirolle!\" he said at last.\n\n\"Well, what?\" she asked.\n\nThe eyes of the danseuse followed those of the little old man; and when\nshe recognized the presence of the clerk she went off into such fits of\nlaughter that not only was the old gentleman nonplussed, but Oscar was\ncompelled to appear; for Florentine took him by the arm, still pealing\nwith laughter at the conscience-stricken faces of the uncle and nephew.\n\n\"You here, nephew?\"\n\n\"Nephew! so he's your nephew?\" cried Florentine, with another burst of\nlaughter. \"You never told me about him. Why didn't Mariette carry you\noff?\" she said to Oscar, who stood there petrified. \"What can he do now,\npoor boy?\"\n\n\"Whatever he pleases!\" said Cardot, sharply, marching to the door as if\nto go away.\n\n\"One moment, papa Cardot. You will be so good as to get your nephew out\nof a scrape into which I led him; for he played the money of his master\nand lost it, and I lend him a thousand francs to win it back, and he\nlost that too.\"\n\n\"Miserable boy! you lost fifteen hundred francs at play at your age?\"\n\n\"Oh, uncle, uncle!\" cried poor Oscar, plunged by these words into all\nthe horrors of his position, and falling on his knees before his uncle,\nwith clasped hands, \"It is twelve o'clock! I am lost, dishonored!\nMonsieur Desroches will have no pity! He gave me the money for an\nimportant affair, in which his pride was concerned. I was to get a paper\nat the Palais in the case of Vandernesse versus Vandernesse! What will\nbecome of me? Oh, save me for the sake of my father and aunt! Come\nwith me to Monsieur Desroches, and explain it to him; make some\nexcuse,--anything!\"\n\nThese sentences were jerked out through sobs and tears that might have\nmoved the sphinx of Luxor.\n\n\"Old skinflint!\" said the danseuse, who was crying, \"will you let your\nown nephew be dishonored,--the son of the man to whom you owe your\nfortune?--for his name is Oscar Husson. Save him, or Titine will deny\nyou forever!\"\n\n\"But how did he come here?\" asked Cardot.\n\n\"Don't you see that the reason he forgot to go for those papers was\nbecause he was drunk and overslept himself. Georges and his cousin\nFrederic took all the clerks in his office to a feast at the Rocher de\nCancale.\"\n\nPere Cardot looked at Florentine and hesitated.\n\n\"Come, come,\" she said, \"you old monkey, shouldn't I have hid him better\nif there had been anything else in it?\"\n\n\"There, take your five hundred francs, you scamp!\" said Cardot to his\nnephew, \"and remember, that's the last penny you'll ever get from me.\nGo and make it up with your master if you can. I'll return the thousand\nfrancs which you borrowed of mademoiselle; but I'll never hear another\nword about you.\"\n\nOscar disappeared, not wishing to hear more. Once in the street,\nhowever, he knew not where to go.\n\nChance which destroys men and chance which saves them were both making\nequal efforts for and against Oscar during that fateful morning. But he\nwas doomed to fall before a master who forgave no failure in any affair\nhe had once undertaken. When Mariette reached home that night, she\nfelt alarmed at what might happen to the youth in whom her brother took\ninterest and she wrote a hasty note to Godeschal, telling him what had\nhappened to Oscar and inclosing a bank bill for five hundred francs to\nrepair his loss. The kind-hearted creature went to sleep after charging\nher maid to carry the little note to Desroches' office before seven\no'clock in the morning. Godeschal, on his side, getting up at six and\nfinding that Oscar had not returned, guessed what had happened. He took\nthe five hundred francs from his own little hoard and rushed to the\nPalais, where he obtained a copy of the judgment and returned in time to\nlay it before Desroches by eight o'clock.\n\nMeantime Desroches, who always rose at four, was in his office by seven.\nMariette's maid, not finding the brother of her mistress in his bedroom,\ncame down to the office and there met Desroches, to whom she very\nnaturally offered the note.\n\n\"Is it about business?\" he said; \"I am Monsieur Desroches.\"\n\n\"You can see, monsieur,\" replied the maid.\n\nDesroches opened the letter and read it. Finding the five-hundred-franc\nnote, he went into his private office furiously angry with his second\nclerk. About half-past seven he heard Godeschal dictating to the second\nhead-clerk a copy of the document in question, and a few moments later\nthe good fellow entered his master's office with an air of triumph in\nhis heart.\n\n\"Did Oscar Husson fetch the paper this morning from Simon?\" inquired\nDesroches.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Who gave him the money?\"\n\n\"Why, you did, Saturday,\" replied Godeschal.\n\n\"Then it rains five-hundred-franc notes,\" cried Desroches. \"Look here,\nGodeschal, you are a fine fellow, but that little Husson does not\ndeserve such generosity. I hate idiots, but I hate still more the men\nwho will go wrong in spite of the fatherly care which watches over\nthem.\" He gave Godeschal Mariette's letter and the five-hundred-franc\nnote which she had sent. \"You must excuse my having opened it,\" he said,\n\"but your sister's maid told me it was on business. Dismiss Husson.\"\n\n\"Poor unhappy boy! what grief he has caused me!\" said Godeschal, \"that\ntall ne'er-do-well of a Georges Marest is his evil genius; he ought\nto flee him like the plague; if not, he'll bring him to some third\ndisgrace.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" asked Desroches.\n\nGodeschal then related briefly the affair of the journey to Presles.\n\n\"Ah! yes,\" said the lawyer, \"I remember Joseph Bridau told me that story\nabout the time it happened. It is to that meeting that we owe the favor\nMonsieur de Serizy has since shown in the matter of Joseph's brother,\nPhilippe Bridau.\"\n\nAt this moment Moreau, to whom the case of the Vandernesse estate was of\nmuch importance, entered the office. The marquis wished to sell the\nland in parcels and the count was opposed to such a sale. The land-agent\nreceived therefore the first fire of Desroches' wrath against his\nex-second clerk and all the threatening prophecies which he fulminated\nagainst him. The result was that this most sincere friend and protector\nof the unhappy youth came to the conclusion that his vanity was\nincorrigible.\n\n\"Make him a barrister,\" said Desroches. \"He has only his last\nexamination to pass. In that line, his defects might prove virtues, for\nself-love and vanity give tongues to half the attorneys.\"\n\nAt this time Clapart, who was ill, was being nursed by his wife,--a\npainful task, a duty without reward. The sick man tormented the poor\ncreature, who was now doomed to learn what venomous and spiteful teasing\na half-imbecile man, whom poverty had rendered craftily savage, could\nbe capable of in the weary tete-a-tete of each endless day. Delighted to\nturn a sharpened arrow in the sensitive heart of the mother, he had, in\na measure, studied the fears that Oscar's behavior and defects inspired\nin the poor woman. When a mother receives from her child a shock like\nthat of the affair at Presles, she continues in a state of constant\nfear, and, by the manner in which his wife boasted of Oscar every time\nhe obtained the slightest success, Clapart knew the extent of her secret\nuneasiness, and he took pains to rouse it on every occasion.\n\n\"Well, Madame,\" Clapart would say, \"Oscar is doing better than I even\nhoped. That journey to Presles was only a heedlessness of youth. Where\ncan you find young lads who do not commit just such faults? Poor child!\nhe bears his privations heroically! If his father had lived, he would\nnever have had any. God grant he may know how to control his passions!\"\netc., etc.\n\nWhile all these catastrophes were happening in the rue de Vendome and\nthe rue de Bethisy, Clapart, sitting in the chimney corner, wrapped in\nan old dressing-gown, watched his wife, who was engaged over the fire\nin their bedroom in simultaneously making the family broth, Clapart's\n\"tisane,\" and her own breakfast.\n\n\"Mon Dieu! I wish I knew how the affair of yesterday ended. Oscar was\nto breakfast at the Rocher de Cancale and spend the evening with a\nmarquise--\"\n\n\"Don't trouble yourself! Sooner or later you'll find out about your\nswan,\" said her husband. \"Do you really believe in that marquise? Pooh!\nA young man who has senses and a taste for extravagance like Oscar can\nfind such ladies as that on every bush--if he pays for them. Some fine\nmorning you'll find yourself with a load of debt on your back.\"\n\n\"You are always trying to put me in despair!\" cried Madame Clapart. \"You\ncomplained that my son lived on your salary, and never has he cost you\na penny. For two years you haven't had the slightest cause of complaint\nagainst him; here he is second clerk, his uncle and Monsieur Moreau pay\nall expenses, and he earns, himself, a salary of eight hundred francs.\nIf we have bread to eat in our old age we may owe it all to that dear\nboy. You are really too unjust--\"\n\n\"You call my foresight unjust, do you?\" replied the invalid, crossly.\n\nJust then the bell rang loudly. Madame Clapart ran to open the door, and\nremained in the outer room with Moreau, who had come to soften the blow\nwhich Oscar's new folly would deal to the heart of his poor mother.\n\n\"What! he gambled with the money of the office?\" she cried, bursting\ninto tears.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you so, hey?\" said Clapart, appearing like a spectre at\nthe door of the salon whither his curiosity had brought him.\n\n\"Oh! what shall we do with him?\" said Madame Clapart, whose grief made\nher impervious to Clapart's taunt.\n\n\"If he bore my name,\" replied Moreau, \"I should wait composedly till he\ndraws for the conscription, and if he gets a fatal number I should not\nprovide him with a substitute. This is the second time your son has\ncommitted a folly out of sheer vanity. Well, vanity may inspire fine\ndeeds in war and may advance him in the career of a soldier. Besides,\nsix years of military service will put some lead into his head; and\nas he has only his last legal examination to pass, it won't be much\nill-luck for him if he doesn't become a lawyer till he is twenty-six;\nthat is, if he wants to continue in the law after paying, as they say,\nhis tax of blood. By that time, at any rate, he will have been severely\npunished, he will have learned experience, and contracted habits of\nsubordination. Before making his probation at the bar he will have gone\nthrough his probations in life.\"\n\n\"If that is your decision for a son,\" said Madame Clapart, \"I see that\nthe heart of a father is not like that of a mother. My poor Oscar a\ncommon soldier!--\"\n\n\"Would you rather he flung himself headforemost into the Seine after\ncommitting a dishonorable action? He cannot now become a solicitor; do\nyou think him steady and wise enough to be a barrister? No. While\nhis reason is maturing, what will he become? A dissipated fellow. The\ndiscipline of the army will, at least, preserve him from that.\"\n\n\"Could he not go into some other office? His uncle Cardot has promised\nto pay for his substitute; Oscar is to dedicate his graduating thesis to\nhim.\"\n\nAt this moment carriage-wheels were heard, and a hackney-coach\ncontaining Oscar and all his worldly belongings stopped before the door.\nThe luckless young man came up at once.\n\n\"Ah! here you are, Monsieur Joli-Coeur!\" cried Clapart.\n\nOscar kissed his mother, and held out to Moreau a hand which the latter\nrefused to take. To this rebuff Oscar replied by a reproachful look, the\nboldness of which he had never shown before. Then he turned on Clapart.\n\n\"Listen to me, monsieur,\" said the youth, transformed into a man. \"You\nworry my poor mother devilishly, and that's your right, for she is,\nunfortunately, your wife. But as for me, it is another thing. I shall be\nof age in a few months; and you have no rights over me even as a minor.\nI have never asked anything of you. Thanks to Monsieur Moreau, I have\nnever cost you one penny, and I owe you no gratitude. Therefore, I say,\nlet me alone!\"\n\nClapart, hearing this apostrophe, slunk back to his sofa in the chimney\ncorner. The reasoning and the inward fury of the young man, who had just\nreceived a lecture from his friend Godeschal, silenced the imbecile mind\nof the sick man.\n\n\"A momentary temptation, such as you yourself would have yielded to\nat my age,\" said Oscar to Moreau, \"has made me commit a fault which\nDesroches thinks serious, though it is only a peccadillo. I am more\nprovoked with myself for taking Florentine of the Gaiete for a marquise\nthan I am for losing fifteen hundred francs after a little debauch in\nwhich everybody, even Godeschal, was half-seas over. This time, at any\nrate, I've hurt no one by myself. I'm cured of such things forever. If\nyou are willing to help me, Monsieur Moreau, I swear to you that the\nsix years I must still stay a clerk before I can get a practice shall be\nspent without--\"\n\n\"Stop there!\" said Moreau. \"I have three children, and I can make no\npromises.\"\n\n\"Never mind, never mind,\" said Madame Clapart to her son, casting a\nreproachful glance at Moreau. \"Your uncle Cardot--\"\n\n\"I have no longer an uncle Cardot,\" replied Oscar, who related the scene\nat the rue de Vendome.\n\nMadame Clapart, feeling her legs give way under the weight of her body,\nstaggered to a chair in the dining-room, where she fell as if struck by\nlightning.\n\n\"All the miseries together!\" she said, as she fainted.\n\nMoreau took the poor mother in his arms, and carried her to the bed in\nher chamber. Oscar remained motionless, as if crushed.\n\n\"There is nothing left for you,\" said Moreau, coming back to him, \"but\nto make yourself a soldier. That idiot of a Clapart looks to me as\nthough he couldn't live three months, and then your mother will be\nwithout a penny. Ought I not, therefore, to reserve for her the little\nmoney I am able to give? It was impossible to tell you this before her.\nAs a soldier, you'll eat plain bread and reflect on life such as it is\nto those who are born into it without fortune.\"\n\n\"I may get a lucky number,\" said Oscar.\n\n\"Suppose you do, what then? Your mother has well fulfilled her duty\ntowards you. She gave you an education; she placed you on the right\nroad, and secured you a career. You have left it. Now, what can you do?\nWithout money, nothing; as you know by this time. You are not a man who\ncan begin a new career by taking off your coat and going to work in your\nshirt-sleeves with the tools of an artisan. Besides, your mother loves\nyou, and she would die to see you come to that.\"\n\nOscar sat down and no longer restrained his tears, which flowed\ncopiously. At last he understood this language, so completely\nunintelligible to him ever since his first fault.\n\n\"Men without means ought to be perfect,\" added Moreau, not suspecting\nthe profundity of that cruel sentence.\n\n\"My fate will soon be decided,\" said Oscar. \"I draw my number the day\nafter to-morrow. Between now and then I will decide upon my future.\"\n\nMoreau, deeply distressed in spite of his stern bearing, left the\nhousehold in the rue de la Cerisaie to its despair.\n\nThree days later Oscar drew the number twenty-seven. In the interests of\nthe poor lad the former steward of Presles had the courage to go to the\nComte de Serizy and ask for his influence to get Oscar into the cavalry.\nIt happened that the count's son, having left the Ecole Polytechnique\nrather low in his class, was appointed, as a favor, sub-lieutenant in\na regiment of cavalry commanded by the Duc de Maufrigneuse. Oscar had,\ntherefore, in his great misfortune, the small luck of being, at the\nComte de Serizy's instigation, drafted into that noble regiment, with\nthe promise of promotion to quartermaster within a year. Chance had thus\nplaced the ex-clerk under the command of the son of the Comte de Serizy.\n\nMadame Clapart, after languishing for some days, so keenly was she\naffected by these catastrophes, became a victim to the remorse which\nseizes upon many a mother whose conduct has been frail in her youth,\nand who, in her old age, turns to repentance. She now considered herself\nunder a curse. She attributed the sorrows of her second marriage and the\nmisfortunes of her son to a just retribution by which God was compelling\nher to expiate the errors and pleasures of her youth. This opinion soon\nbecame a certainty in her mind. The poor woman went, for the first\ntime in forty years, to confess herself to the Abbe Gaudron, vicar of\nSaint-Paul's, who led her into the practice of devotion. But so ill-used\nand loving a soul as that of Madame Clapart's could never be anything\nbut simply pious. The Aspasia of the Directory wanted to expiate her\nsins in order to draw down the blessing of God on the head of her poor\nOscar, and she henceforth vowed herself to works and deeds of the purest\npiety. She believed she had won the attention of heaven when she saved\nthe life of Monsieur Clapart, who, thanks to her devotion, lived on to\ntorture her; but she chose to see, in the tyranny of that imbecile mind,\na trial inflicted by the hand of one who loveth while he chasteneth.\n\nOscar, meantime, behaved so well that in 1830 he was first sergeant\nof the company of the Vicomte de Serizy, which gave him the rank of\nsub-lieutenant of the line. Oscar Husson was by that time twenty-five\nyears old. As the Royal Guard, to which his regiment was attached, was\nalways in garrison in Paris, or within a circumference of thirty miles\naround the capital, he came to see his mother from time to time, and\ntell her his griefs; for he had the sense to see that he could never\nbecome an officer as matters then were. At that time the cavalry grades\nwere all being taken up by the younger sons of noble families, and men\nwithout the article to their names found promotion difficult. Oscar's\nsole ambition was to leave the Guards and be appointed sub-lieutenant in\na regiment of the cavalry of the line. In the month of February, 1830,\nMadame Clapart obtained this promotion for her son through the influence\nof Madame la Dauphine, granted to the Abbe Gaudron, now rector of\nSaint-Pauls.\n\nAlthough Oscar outwardly professed to be devoted to the Bourbons, in\nthe depths of his heart he was a liberal. Therefore, in the struggle of\n1830, he went over to the side of the people. This desertion, which\nhad an importance due to the crisis in which it took place, brought him\nbefore the eyes of the public. During the excitement of triumph in the\nmonth of August he was promoted lieutenant, received the cross of the\nLegion of honor, and was attached as aide-de-camp to La Fayette, who\ngave him the rank of captain in 1832. When the amateur of the best of\nall possible republics was removed from the command of the National\nguard, Oscar Husson, whose devotion to the new dynasty amounted to\nfanaticism, was appointed major of a regiment sent to Africa at the time\nof the first expedition undertaken by the Prince-royal. The Vicomte de\nSerizy chanced to be the lieutenant-colonel of this regiment. At the\naffair of the Makta, where the field had to be abandoned to the\nArabs, Monsieur de Serizy was left wounded under a dead horse. Oscar,\ndiscovering this, called out to the squadron:\n\n\"Messieurs, it is going to death, but we cannot abandon our colonel.\"\n\nHe dashed upon the enemy, and his electrified soldiers followed him.\nThe Arabs, in their first astonishment at this furious and unlooked-for\nreturn, allowed Oscar to seize the viscount, whom he flung across his\nhorse, and carried off at full gallop,--receiving, as he did so, two\nslashes from yataghans on his left arm.\n\nOscar's conduct on this occasion was rewarded with the officer's\ncross of the Legion of honor, and by his promotion to the rank of\nlieutenant-colonel. He took the most affectionate care of the Vicomte de\nSerizy, whose mother came to meet him on the arrival of the regiment at\nToulon, where, as we know, the young man died of his wounds.\n\nThe Comtesse de Serizy had not separated her son from the man who had\nshown him such devotion. Oscar himself was so seriously wounded that the\nsurgeons whom the countess had brought with her from Paris thought best\nto amputate his left arm.\n\nThus the Comte de Serizy was led not only to forgive Oscar for his\npainful remarks on the journey to Presles, but to feel himself his\ndebtor on behalf of his son, now buried in the chapel of the chateau de\nSerizy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. OSCAR'S LAST BLUNDER\n\n\nSome years after the affair at Makta, an old lady, dressed in black,\nleaning on the arm of a man about thirty-four years of age, in whom\nobservers would recognize a retired officer, from the loss of an arm and\nthe rosette of the Legion of honor in his button-hole, was standing, at\neight o'clock, one morning in the month of May, under the porte-cochere\nof the Lion d'Argent, rue de Faubourg Saint-Denis, waiting, apparently,\nfor the departure of a diligence. Undoubtedly Pierrotin, the master of\nthe line of coaches running through the valley of the Oise (despatching\none through Saint-Leu-Taverny and Isle-Adam to Beaumont), would scarcely\nhave recognized in this bronzed and maimed officer the little Oscar\nHusson he had formerly taken to Presles. Madame Husson, at last a widow,\nwas as little recognizable as her son. Clapart, a victim of Fieschi's\nmachine, had served his wife better by death than by all his previous\nlife. The idle lounger was hanging about, as usual, on the boulevard du\nTemple, gazing at the show, when the explosion came. The poor widow\nwas put upon the pension list, made expressly for the families of the\nvictim, at fifteen hundred francs a year.\n\nThe coach, to which were harnessed four iron-gray horses that would\nhave done honor to the Messageries-royales, was divided into three\ncompartments, coupe, interieur, and rotonde, with an imperiale above. It\nresembled those diligences called \"Gondoles,\" which now ply, in rivalry\nwith the railroad, between Paris and Versailles. Both solid and light,\nwell-painted and well-kept, lined with fine blue cloth, and furnished\nwith blinds of a Moorish pattern and cushions of red morocco, the\n\"Swallow of the Oise\" could carry, comfortably, nineteen passengers.\nPierrotin, now about fifty-six years old, was little changed. Still\ndressed in a blue blouse, beneath which he wore a black suit, he smoked\nhis pipe, and superintended the two porters in livery, who were stowing\naway the luggage in the great imperiale.\n\n\"Are your places taken?\" he said to Madame Clapart and Oscar, eyeing\nthem like a man who is trying to recall a likeness to his memory.\n\n\"Yes, two places for the interieur in the name of my servant,\nBellejambe,\" replied Oscar; \"he must have taken them last evening.\"\n\n\"Ah! monsieur is the new collector of Beaumont,\" said Pierrotin. \"You\ntake the place of Monsieur Margueron's nephew?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Oscar, pressing the arm of his mother, who was about to\nspeak.\n\nThe officer wished to remain unknown for a time.\n\nJust then Oscar thrilled at hearing the well-remembered voice of Georges\nMarest calling out from the street: \"Pierrotin, have you one seat left?\"\n\n\"It seems to me you could say 'monsieur' without cracking your throat,\"\nreplied the master of the line of coaches of the Valley of the Oise,\nsharply.\n\nUnless by the sound of the voice, Oscar could never have recognized the\nindividual whose jokes had been so fatal to him. Georges, almost bald,\nretained only three or four tufts of hair above his ears; but these were\nelaborately frizzed out to conceal, as best they could, the nakedness\nof the skull. A fleshiness ill-placed, in other words, a pear-shaped\nstomach, altered the once elegant proportions of the ex-young man. Now\nalmost ignoble in appearance and bearing, Georges exhibited the traces\nof disasters in love and a life of debauchery in his blotched skin and\nbloated, vinous features. The eyes had lost the brilliancy, the vivacity\nof youth which chaste or studious habits have the virtue to retain.\nDressed like a man who is careless of his clothes, Georges wore a pair\nof shabby trousers, with straps intended for varnished boots; but his\nwere of leather, thick-soled, ill-blacked, and of many months' wear. A\nfaded waistcoat, a cravat, pretentiously tied, although the material was\na worn-out foulard, bespoke the secret distress to which a former dandy\nsometimes falls a prey. Moreover, Georges appeared at this hour of the\nmorning in an evening coat, instead of a surtout; a sure diagnostic of\nactual poverty. This coat, which had seen long service at balls, had\nnow, like its master, passed from the opulent ease of former times to\ndaily work. The seams of the black cloth showed whitening lines; the\ncollar was greasy; long usage had frayed the edges of the sleeves into\nfringes.\n\nAnd yet, Georges ventured to attract attention by yellow kid gloves,\nrather dirty, it is true, on the outside of which a signet ring\ndefined a large dark spot. Round his cravat, which was slipped into a\npretentious gold ring, was a chain of silk, representing hair, which,\nno doubt, held a watch. His hat, though worn rather jauntily, revealed,\nmore than any of the above symptoms, the poverty of a man who was\ntotally unable to pay sixteen francs to a hat-maker, being forced to\nlive from hand to mouth. The former admirer of Florentine twirled a cane\nwith a chased gold knob, which was horribly battered. The blue trousers,\nthe waistcoat of a material called \"Scotch stuff,\" a sky-blue cravat and\na pink-striped cotton shirt, expressed, in the midst of all this ruin,\nsuch a latent desire to SHOW-OFF that the contrast was not only a sight\nto see, but a lesson to be learned.\n\n\"And that is Georges!\" said Oscar, in his own mind,--\"a man I left in\npossession of thirty thousand francs a year!\"\n\n\"Has Monsieur _de_ Pierrotin a place in the coupe?\" asked Georges,\nironically replying to Pierrotin's rebuff.\n\n\"No; my coupe is taken by a peer of France, the son-in-law of Monsieur\nMoreau, Monsieur le Baron de Canalis, his wife, and his mother-in-law. I\nhave nothing left but one place in the interieur.\"\n\n\"The devil! so peers of France still travel in your coach, do they?\"\nsaid Georges, remembering his adventure with the Comte de Serizy. \"Well,\nI'll take that place in the interieur.\"\n\nHe cast a glance of examination on Oscar and his mother, but did not\nrecognize them.\n\nOscar's skin was now bronzed by the sun of Africa; his moustache was\nvery thick and his whiskers ample; the hollows in his cheeks and his\nstrongly marked features were in keeping with his military bearing.\nThe rosette of an officer of the Legion of honor, his missing arm,\nthe strict propriety of his dress, would all have diverted Georges\nrecollections of his former victim if he had had any. As for Madame\nClapart, whom Georges had scarcely seen, ten years devoted to the\nexercise of the most severe piety had transformed her. No one would ever\nhave imagined that that gray sister concealed the Aspasia of 1797.\n\nAn enormous old man, very simply dressed, though his clothes were good\nand substantial, in whom Oscar recognized Pere Leger, here came slowly\nand heavily along. He nodded familiarly to Pierrotin, who appeared by\nhis manner to pay him the respect due in all lands to millionaires.\n\n\"Ha! ha! why, here's Pere Leger! more and more preponderant!\" cried\nGeorges.\n\n\"To whom have I the honor of speaking?\" asked old Leger, curtly.\n\n\"What! you don't recognize Colonel Georges, the friend of Ali pacha?\nWe travelled together once upon a time, in company with the Comte de\nSerizy.\"\n\nOne of the habitual follies of those who have fallen in the world is to\nrecognize and desire the recognition of others.\n\n\"You are much changed,\" said the ex-farmer, now twice a millionaire.\n\n\"All things change,\" said Georges. \"Look at the Lion d'Argent and\nPierrotin's coach; they are not a bit like what they were fourteen years\nago.\"\n\n\"Pierrotin now controls the whole service of the Valley of the Oise,\"\nreplied Monsieur Leger, \"and sends out five coaches. He is the bourgeois\nof Beaumont, where he keeps a hotel, at which all the diligences stop,\nand he has a wife and daughter who are not a bad help to him.\"\n\nAn old man of seventy here came out of the hotel and joined the group of\ntravellers who were waiting to get into the coach.\n\n\"Come along, Papa Reybert,\" said Leger, \"we are only waiting now for\nyour great man.\"\n\n\"Here he comes,\" said the steward of Presles, pointing to Joseph Bridau.\n\nNeither Georges nor Oscar recognized the illustrious artist, for his\nface had the worn and haggard lines that were now famous, and his\nbearing was that which is given by success. The ribbon of the Legion\nof honor adorned his black coat, and the rest of his dress, which was\nextremely elegant, seemed to denote an expedition to some rural fete.\n\nAt this moment a clerk, with a paper in his hand, came out of the office\n(which was now in the former kitchen of the Lion d'Argent), and stood\nbefore the empty coupe.\n\n\"Monsieur and Madame de Canalis, three places,\" he said. Then, moving\nto the door of the interieur, he named, consecutively, \"Monsieur\nBellejambe, two places; Monsieur de Reybert, three places;\nMonsieur--your name, if you please?\" he said to Georges.\n\n\"Georges Marest,\" said the fallen man, in a low voice.\n\nThe clerk then moved to the rotunde, before which were grouped a number\nof nurses, country-people, and petty shopkeepers, who were bidding each\nother adieu. Then, after bundling in the six passengers, he called\nto four young men who mounted to the imperial; after which he cried:\n\"Start!\" Pierrotin got up beside his driver, a young man in a blouse,\nwho called out: \"Pull!\" to his animals, and the vehicle, drawn by four\nhorses brought at Roye, mounted the rise of the faubourg Saint-Denis at\na slow trot.\n\nBut no sooner had it got above Saint-Laurent than it raced like a\nmail-cart to Saint-Denis, which it reached in forty minutes. No stop\nwas made at the cheese-cake inn, and the coach took the road through the\nvalley of Montmorency.\n\nIt was at the turn into this road that Georges broke the silence which\nthe travellers had so far maintained while observing each other.\n\n\"We go a little faster than we did fifteen years ago, hey, Pere Leger?\"\nhe said, pulling out a silver watch.\n\n\"Persons are usually good enough to call me Monsieur Leger,\" said the\nmillionaire.\n\n\"Why, here's our blagueur of the famous journey to Presles,\" cried\nJoseph Bridau. \"Have you made any new campaigns in Asia, Africa, or\nAmerica?\"\n\n\"Sacrebleu! I've made the revolution of July, and that's enough for me,\nfor it ruined me.\"\n\n\"Ah! you made the revolution of July!\" cried the painter, laughing.\n\"Well, I always said it never made itself.\"\n\n\"How people meet again!\" said Monsieur Leger, turning to Monsieur de\nReybert. \"This, papa Reybert, is the clerk of the notary to whom you\nundoubtedly owe the stewardship of Presles.\"\n\n\"We lack Mistigris, now famous under his own name of Leon de Lora,\" said\nJoseph Bridau, \"and the little young man who was stupid enough to talk\nto the count about those skin diseases which are now cured, and about\nhis wife, whom he has recently left that he may die in peace.\"\n\n\"And the count himself, you lack him,\" said old Reybert.\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" said Joseph Bridau, sadly, \"that the last journey the\ncount will ever take will be from Presles to Isle-Adam, to be present at\nmy marriage.\"\n\n\"He still drives about the park,\" said Reybert.\n\n\"Does his wife come to see him?\" asked Leger.\n\n\"Once a month,\" replied Reybert. \"She is never happy out of Paris. Last\nSeptember she married her niece, Mademoiselle du Rouvre, on whom, since\nthe death of her son, she spends all her affection, to a very rich young\nPole, the Comte Laginski.\"\n\n\"To whom,\" asked Madame Clapart, \"will Monsieur de Serizy's property\ngo?\"\n\n\"To his wife, who will bury him,\" replied Georges. \"The countess is\nstill fine-looking for a woman of fifty-four years of age. She is very\nelegant, and, at a little distance, gives one the illusion--\"\n\n\"She will always be an illusion to you,\" said Leger, who seemed inclined\nto revenge himself on his former hoaxer.\n\n\"I respect her,\" said Georges. \"But, by the bye, what became of that\nsteward whom the count turned off?\"\n\n\"Moreau?\" said Leger; \"why, he's the deputy from the Oise.\"\n\n\"Ha! the famous Centre man; Moreau de l'Oise?\" cried Georges.\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Leger, \"Moreau de l'Oise. He did more than you for the\nrevolution of July, and he has since then bought the beautiful estate of\nPointel, between Presles and Beaumont.\"\n\n\"Next to the count's,\" said Georges. \"I call that very bad taste.\"\n\n\"Don't speak so loud,\" said Monsieur de Reybert, \"for Madame Moreau and\nher daughter, the Baronne de Canalis, and the Baron himself, the former\nminister, are in the coupe.\"\n\n\"What 'dot' could he have given his daughter to induce our great orator\nto marry her?\" said Georges.\n\n\"Something like two millions,\" replied old Leger.\n\n\"He always had a taste for millions,\" remarked Georges. \"He began his\npile surreptitiously at Presles--\"\n\n\"Say nothing against Monsieur Moreau,\" cried Oscar, hastily. \"You ought\nto have learned before now to hold your tongue in public conveyances.\"\n\nJoseph Bridau looked at the one-armed officer for several seconds; then\nhe said, smiling:--\n\n\"Monsieur is not an ambassador, but his rosette tells us he has made his\nway nobly; my brother and General Giroudeau have repeatedly named him in\ntheir reports.\"\n\n\"Oscar Husson!\" cried Georges. \"Faith! if it hadn't been for your voice\nI should never have known you.\"\n\n\"Ah! it was monsieur who so bravely rescued the Vicomte Jules de Serizy\nfrom the Arabs?\" said Reybert, \"and for whom the count has obtained the\ncollectorship of Beaumont while awaiting that of Pontoise?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" said Oscar.\n\n\"I hope you will give me the pleasure, monsieur,\" said the great\npainter, \"of being present at my marriage at Isle-Adam.\"\n\n\"Whom do you marry?\" asked Oscar, after accepting the invitation.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Leger,\" replied Joseph Bridau, \"the granddaughter of\nMonsieur de Reybert. Monsieur le comte was kind enough to arrange the\nmarriage for me. As an artist I owe him a great deal, and he wished,\nbefore his death, to secure my future, about which I did not think,\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Whom did Pere Leger marry?\" asked Georges.\n\n\"My daughter,\" replied Monsieur de Reybert, \"and without a 'dot.'\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Georges, assuming a more respectful manner toward Monsieur\nLeger, \"I am fortunate in having chosen this particular day to do the\nvalley of the Oise. You can all be useful to me, gentlemen.\"\n\n\"How so?\" asked Monsieur Leger.\n\n\"In this way,\" replied Georges. \"I am employed by the 'Esperance,' a\ncompany just formed, the statutes of which have been approved by an\nordinance of the King. This institution gives, at the end of ten years,\ndowries to young girls, annuities to old men; it pays the education of\nchildren, and takes charge, in short, of the fortunes of everybody.\"\n\n\"I can well believe it,\" said Pere Leger, smiling. \"In a word, you are a\nrunner for an insurance company.\"\n\n\"No, monsieur. I am the inspector-general; charged with the duty of\nestablishing correspondents and appointing the agents of the company\nthroughout France. I am only operating until the agents are selected;\nfor it is a matter as delicate as it is difficult to find honest\nagents.\"\n\n\"But how did you lose your thirty thousand a year?\" asked Oscar.\n\n\"As you lost your arm,\" replied the son of Czerni-Georges, curtly.\n\n\"Then you must have shared in some brilliant action,\" remarked Oscar,\nwith a sarcasm not unmixed with bitterness.\n\n\"Parbleu! I've too many--shares! that's just what I wanted to sell.\"\n\nBy this time they had arrived at Saint-Leu-Taverny, where all the\npassengers got out while the coach changed horses. Oscar admired the\nliveliness which Pierrotin displayed in unhooking the traces from the\nwhiffle-trees, while his driver cleared the reins from the leaders.\n\n\"Poor Pierrotin,\" thought he; \"he has stuck like me,--not far advanced\nin the world. Georges has fallen low. All the others, thanks to\nspeculation and to talent, have made their fortune. Do we breakfast\nhere, Pierrotin?\" he said, aloud, slapping that worthy on the shoulder.\n\n\"I am not the driver,\" said Pierrotin.\n\n\"What are you, then?\" asked Colonel Husson.\n\n\"The proprietor,\" replied Pierrotin.\n\n\"Come, don't be vexed with an old acquaintance,\" said Oscar, motioning\nto his mother, but still retaining his patronizing manner. \"Don't you\nrecognize Madame Clapart?\"\n\nIt was all the nobler of Oscar to present his mother to Pierrotin,\nbecause, at that moment, Madame Moreau de l'Oise, getting out of the\ncoupe, overheard the name, and stared disdainfully at Oscar and his\nmother.\n\n\"My faith! madame,\" said Pierrotin, \"I should never have known you; nor\nyou, either, monsieur; the sun burns black in Africa, doesn't it?\"\n\nThe species of pity which Oscar thus felt for Pierrotin was the last\nblunder that vanity ever led our hero to commit, and, like his other\nfaults, it was punished, but very gently, thus:--\n\nTwo months after his official installation at Beaumont-sur-Oise, Oscar\nwas paying his addresses to Mademoiselle Georgette Pierrotin, whose\n'dot' amounted to one hundred and fifty thousand francs, and he married\nthe pretty daughter of the proprietor of the stage-coaches of the Oise,\ntoward the close of the winter of 1838.\n\nThe adventure of the journey to Presles was a lesson to Oscar Husson in\ndiscretion; his disaster at Florentine's card-party strengthened him in\nhonesty and uprightness; the hardships of his military career taught him\nto understand the social hierarchy and to yield obedience to his lot.\nBecoming wise and capable, he was happy. The Comte de Serizy, before his\ndeath, obtained for him the collectorship at Pontoise. The influence\nof Monsieur Moreau de l'Oise and that of the Comtesse de Serizy and the\nBaron de Canalis secured, in after years, a receiver-generalship for\nMonsieur Husson, in whom the Camusot family now recognize a relation.\n\nOscar is a commonplace man, gentle, without assumption, modest, and\nalways keeping, like his government, to a middle course. He excites\nneither envy nor contempt. In short, he is the modern bourgeois.\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\n\nThe following personages appear in other stories of the Human Comedy.\n\n     Beaupre, Fanny\n       Modest Mignon\n       The Muse of the

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":283,"split":"train"}
