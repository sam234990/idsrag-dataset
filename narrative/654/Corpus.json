{"ori_id":"9bd99dd1525e23d34c132f256ad8204cdf6fe089","title":"Cousin Bette","context":"Cousin Bette\n The first third of the novel provides a lengthy exploration of the characters' histories. Balzac makes this clear after 150 pages: \"Ici se termine, en quelque sorte, l'introduction de cette histoire.\" (\"Here ends what is, in a way, the introduction to this story.\") At the start of the novel, Adeline Hulot\u00a0\u2013 wife of the successful Baron Hector Hulot\u00a0\u2013 is being pressured into an affair by a wealthy perfumer named C\u00e9lestin Crevel. His desire stems in part from an earlier contest in which the adulterous Baron Hulot had won the hand of the singer Jos\u00e9pha Mirah, also favored by Crevel. The Hulots' daughter, Hortense, has begun searching for a husband; their son Victorin is married to Crevel's daughter Celestine. Mme. Hulot resists Crevel's advances, and he turns his attention elsewhere.\nMme. Hulot's cousin, Bette (also called Lisbeth), harbors a deep but hidden resentment of her relatives' success. A peasant woman with none of the physical beauty of her cousin, Bette has rejected a series of marriage proposals from middle-class suitors, and remains unmarried at the age of 42. One day she comes upon a young unsuccessful Polish sculptor named Wenceslas Steinbock, attempting suicide in the tiny apartment upstairs from her own. As she nourishes him back to health, she develops a maternal fondness for him. She also befriends Val\u00e9rie, the wife of a War Department clerk named Marneffe; the two women form a bond of mutual affection and protection.\nBaron Hulot, meanwhile, is rejected by Jos\u00e9pha, who explains bluntly that she has chosen another man because of his larger fortune. Hulot's despair is quickly alleviated when he meets and falls in love with Val\u00e9rie Marneffe. He showers her with gifts, and soon establishes a luxurious house for her and M. Marneffe, with whom he works at the War Department. These debts, compounded by the money he borrowed to lavish on Jos\u00e9pha, threaten the Hulot family's financial security. Panicked, he convinces his uncle Johann Fischer to quietly embezzle funds from a War Department outpost in Algiers. Hulot's woes are momentarily abated and Bette's happiness is shattered, when\u00a0\u2013 at the end of the \"introduction\"\u00a0\u2013 Hortense Hulot marries Wenceslas Steinbock.\nCrushed at having lost Steinbock's company, Bette swears vengeance on the Hulot family. She works behind the scenes with Val\u00e9rie to extract more money from Baron Hulot. Val\u00e9rie also seduces Crevel and watches with delight as they vie for her attention. With Bette's help, Val\u00e9rie turns to Steinbock and draws him into her bedroom. When Hortense learns of his infidelity, she leaves Steinbock and returns with their son to live with her mother Adeline. Val\u00e9rie also proclaims her love to a Brazilian Baron named Henri Mont\u00e8s de Mont\u00e9janos, and swears devotion constantly to each of the five men.\nBaron Hulot's brother, known as \"le mar\u00e9chal\" (\"the Marshal\"), hires Bette as his housekeeper, and they develop a mild affection. He learns of his brother's infidelities (and the difficulties they have caused Adeline, who refuses to leave her husband), and promises to marry Bette if she will provide details. She agrees eagerly, delighted at the prospect of finally securing an enviable marriage. While investigating his brother's behavior, however, the Marshal discovers Baron Hulot's scheme in Algiers. He is overwhelmed by the disgrace, and his health deteriorates. Bette's last hope for a brighter future dies with him.\nWhen Val\u00e9rie becomes pregnant, she tells each of her lovers (and her husband) that he is the father. She gives birth to a stillborn child, however, and her husband dies soon thereafter. Hulot and Crevel are ecstatic when they hear this news, each believing that he will become her only love once the official mourning period has passed. Val\u00e9rie chooses Crevel for his comfortable fortune, and they quickly wed. This news outrages Baron Mont\u00e8s, and he devises a plot to poison the newlyweds. Crevel and Val\u00e9rie die slowly, their bodies devoured by an exotic Brazilian toxin.\nVictorin Hulot is later visited by the Prince of Wissembourg, who delivers news of economic good fortune. The Marshal, prior to his death, had made arrangements for repayment of the Baron's debts, as well as employment for Adeline in a Catholic charity. Baron Hulot has disappeared, and Adeline spends her free time searching for him in houses of ill repute. She eventually finds him living with a fifteen-year-old courtesan, and begs him to return to the family. He agrees, but as he climbs into the carriage, Hulot asks: \"mais pourrai-je emmener la petite?\" (\"But can I take the girl?\") The Hulot home is reunited for a time, and Bette's fury at their apparent happiness hastens her death. One evening after the funeral, Adeline overhears Hulot seducing a kitchen maid named Agathe. On her deathbed, Adeline delivers her first rebuke to her husband: \"[D]ans un moment, tu seras libre, et tu pourras faire une baronne Hulot.\" (\"In a moment, you will be free, and you can make another Baroness Hulot.\") Soon after burying his wife, Hulot marries Agathe.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Cousin Betty, by Honore de Balzac\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Till I heard\n  you, the Divine Comedy was to me a vast enigma to which none had\n  found the clue--the commentators least of all. Thus, to understand\n  Dante is to be as great as he; but every form of greatness is\n  familiar to you.\n\n  A French savant could make a reputation, earn a professor's chair,\n  and a dozen decorations, by publishing in a dogmatic volume the\n  improvised lecture by which you lent enchantment to one of those\n  evenings which are rest after seeing Rome. You do not know,\n  perhaps, that most of our professors live on Germany, on England,\n  on the East, or on the North, as an insect lives on a tree; and,\n  like the insect, become an integral part of it, borrowing their\n  merit from that of what they feed on. Now, Italy hitherto has not\n  yet been worked out in public lectures. No one will ever give me\n  credit for my literary honesty. Merely by plundering you I might\n  have been as learned as three Schlegels in one, whereas I mean to\n  remain a humble Doctor of the Faculty of Social Medicine, a\n  veterinary surgeon for incurable maladies. Were it only to lay a\n  token of gratitude at the feet of my cicerone, I would fain add\n  your illustrious name to those of Porcia, of San-Severino, of\n  Pareto, of di Negro, and of Belgiojoso, who will represent in this\n  \"Human Comedy\" the close and constant alliance between Italy and\n  France, to which Bandello did honor in the same way in the\n  sixteenth century--Bandello, the bishop and author of some strange\n  tales indeed, who left us the splendid collection of romances\n  whence Shakespeare derived many of his plots and even complete\n  characters, word for word.\n\n  The two sketches I dedicate to you are the two eternal aspects of\n  one and the same fact. Homo duplex, said the great Buffon: why not\n  add Res duplex? Everything has two sides, even virtue. Hence\n  Moliere always shows us both sides of every human problem; and\n  Diderot, imitating him, once wrote, \"This is not a mere tale\"--in\n  what is perhaps Diderot's masterpiece, where he shows us the\n  beautiful picture of Mademoiselle de Lachaux sacrificed by\n  Gardanne, side by side with that of a perfect lover dying for his\n  mistress.\n\n  In the same way, these two romances form a pair, like twins of\n  opposite sexes. This is a literary vagary to which a writer may\n  for once give way, especially as part of a work in which I am\n  endeavoring to depict every form that can serve as a garb to mind.\n\n  Most human quarrels arise from the fact that both wise men and\n  dunces exist who are so constituted as to be incapable of seeing\n  more than one side of any fact or idea, while each asserts that\n  the side he sees is the only true and right one. Thus it is\n  written in the Holy Book, \"God will deliver the world over to\n  divisions.\" I must confess that this passage of Scripture alone\n  should persuade the Papal See to give you the control of the two\n  Chambers to carry out the text which found its commentary in 1814,\n  in the decree of Louis XVIII.\n\n  May your wit and the poetry that is in you extend a protecting\n  hand over these two histories of \"The Poor Relations\"\n\n  Of your affectionate humble servant,\n\n  DE BALZAC.\n  PARIS, August-September, 1846.\n\n\n\n\n\nCOUSIN BETTY\n\n\nOne day, about the middle of July 1838, one of the carriages, then\nlately introduced to Paris cabstands, and known as _Milords_, was\ndriving down the Rue de l'Universite, conveying a stout man of middle\nheight in the uniform of a captain of the National Guard.\n\nAmong the Paris crowd, who are supposed to be so clever, there are some\nmen who fancy themselves infinitely more attractive in uniform than in\ntheir ordinary clothes, and who attribute to women so depraved a taste\nthat they believe they will be favorably impressed by the aspect of a\nbusby and of military accoutrements.\n\nThe countenance of this Captain of the Second Company beamed with a\nself-satisfaction that added splendor to his ruddy and somewhat chubby\nface. The halo of glory that a fortune made in business gives to a\nretired tradesman sat on his brow, and stamped him as one of the elect\nof Paris--at least a retired deputy-mayor of his quarter of the town.\nAnd you may be sure that the ribbon of the Legion of Honor was not\nmissing from his breast, gallantly padded _a la Prussienne_. Proudly\nseated in one corner of the _milord_, this splendid person let his\ngaze wander over the passers-by, who, in Paris, often thus meet an\ningratiating smile meant for sweet eyes that are absent.\n\nThe vehicle stopped in the part of the street between the Rue\nde Bellechasse and the Rue de Bourgogne, at the door of a large,\nnewly-build house, standing on part of the court-yard of an ancient\nmansion that had a garden. The old house remained in its original state,\nbeyond the courtyard curtailed by half its extent.\n\nOnly from the way in which the officer accepted the assistance of the\ncoachman to help him out, it was plain that he was past fifty. There are\ncertain movements so undisguisedly heavy that they are as tell-tale as\na register of birth. The captain put on his lemon-colored right-hand\nglove, and, without any question to the gatekeeper, went up the outer\nsteps to the ground of the new house with a look that proclaimed, \"She\nis mine!\"\n\nThe _concierges_ of Paris have sharp eyes; they do not stop visitors who\nwear an order, have a blue uniform, and walk ponderously; in short, they\nknow a rich man when they see him.\n\nThis ground floor was entirely occupied by Monsieur le Baron Hulot\nd'Ervy, Commissary General under the Republic, retired army contractor,\nand at the present time at the head of one of the most important\ndepartments of the War Office, Councillor of State, officer of the\nLegion of Honor, and so forth.\n\nThis Baron Hulot had taken the name of d'Ervy--the place of his\nbirth--to distinguish him from his brother, the famous General Hulot,\nColonel of the Grenadiers of the Imperial Guard, created by the Emperor\nComte de Forzheim after the campaign of 1809. The Count, the elder\nbrother, being responsible for his junior, had, with paternal care,\nplaced him in the commissariat, where, thanks to the services of the two\nbrothers, the Baron deserved and won Napoleon's good graces. After 1807,\nBaron Hulot was Commissary General for the army in Spain.\n\nHaving rung the bell, the citizen-captain made strenuous efforts to\npull his coat into place, for it had rucked up as much at the back as in\nfront, pushed out of shape by the working of a piriform stomach. Being\nadmitted as soon as the servant in livery saw him, the important\nand imposing personage followed the man, who opened the door of the\ndrawing-room, announcing:\n\n\"Monsieur Crevel.\"\n\nOn hearing the name, singularly appropriate to the figure of the man who\nbore it, a tall, fair woman, evidently young-looking for her age, rose\nas if she had received an electric shock.\n\n\"Hortense, my darling, go into the garden with your Cousin Betty,\" she\nsaid hastily to her daughter, who was working at some embroidery at her\nmother's side.\n\nAfter curtseying prettily to the captain, Mademoiselle Hortense went out\nby a glass door, taking with her a withered-looking spinster, who looked\nolder than the Baroness, though she was five years younger.\n\n\"They are settling your marriage,\" said Cousin Betty in the girl's ear,\nwithout seeming at all offended at the way in which the Baroness had\ndismissed them, counting her almost as zero.\n\nThe cousin's dress might, at need, have explained this free-and-easy\ndemeanor. The old maid wore a merino gown of a dark plum color, of which\nthe cut and trimming dated from the year of the Restoration; a little\nworked collar, worth perhaps three francs; and a common straw hat with\nblue satin ribbons edged with straw plait, such as the old-clothes\nbuyers wear at market. On looking down at her kid shoes, made, it was\nevident, by the veriest cobbler, a stranger would have hesitated to\nrecognize Cousin Betty as a member of the family, for she looked exactly\nlike a journeywoman sempstress. But she did not leave the room without\nbestowing a little friendly nod on Monsieur Crevel, to which that\ngentleman responded by a look of mutual understanding.\n\n\"You are coming to us to-morrow, I hope, Mademoiselle Fischer?\" said he.\n\n\"You have no company?\" asked Cousin Betty.\n\n\"My children and yourself, no one else,\" replied the visitor.\n\n\"Very well,\" replied she; \"depend on me.\"\n\n\"And here am I, madame, at your orders,\" said the citizen-captain,\nbowing again to Madame Hulot.\n\nHe gave such a look at Madame Hulot as Tartuffe casts at Elmire--when a\nprovincial actor plays the part and thinks it necessary to emphasize its\nmeaning--at Poitiers, or at Coutances.\n\n\"If you will come into this room with me, we shall be more conveniently\nplaced for talking business than we are in this room,\" said Madame\nHulot, going to an adjoining room, which, as the apartment was arranged,\nserved as a cardroom.\n\nIt was divided by a slight partition from a boudoir looking out on the\ngarden, and Madame Hulot left her visitor to himself for a minute, for\nshe thought it wise to shut the window and the door of the boudoir, so\nthat no one should get in and listen. She even took the precaution of\nshutting the glass door of the drawing-room, smiling on her daughter and\nher cousin, whom she saw seated in an old summer-house at the end of the\ngarden. As she came back she left the cardroom door open, so as to hear\nif any one should open that of the drawing-room to come in.\n\nAs she came and went, the Baroness, seen by nobody, allowed her face to\nbetray all her thoughts, and any one who could have seen her would have\nbeen shocked to see her agitation. But when she finally came back from\nthe glass door of the drawing-room, as she entered the cardroom, her\nface was hidden behind the impenetrable reserve which every woman, even\nthe most candid, seems to have at her command.\n\nDuring all these preparations--odd, to say the least--the National\nGuardsman studied the furniture of the room in which he found himself.\nAs he noted the silk curtains, once red, now faded to dull purple by the\nsunshine, and frayed in the pleats by long wear; the carpet, from which\nthe hues had faded; the discolored gilding of the furniture; and the\nsilk seats, discolored in patches, and wearing into strips--expressions\nof scorn, satisfaction, and hope dawned in succession without disguise\non his stupid tradesman's face. He looked at himself in the glass over\nan old clock of the Empire, and was contemplating the general effect,\nwhen the rustle of her silk skirt announced the Baroness. He at once\nstruck at attitude.\n\nAfter dropping on to a sofa, which had been a very handsome one in the\nyear 1809, the Baroness, pointing to an armchair with the arms ending in\nbronze sphinxes' heads, while the paint was peeling from the wood, which\nshowed through in many places, signed to Crevel to be seated.\n\n\"All the precautions you are taking, madame, would seem full of promise\nto a----\"\n\n\"To a lover,\" said she, interrupting him.\n\n\"The word is too feeble,\" said he, placing his right hand on his heart,\nand rolling his eyes in a way which almost always makes a woman laugh\nwhen she, in cold blood, sees such a look. \"A lover! A lover? Say a man\nbewitched----\"\n\n\"Listen, Monsieur Crevel,\" said the Baroness, too anxious to be able to\nlaugh, \"you are fifty--ten years younger than Monsieur Hulot, I know;\nbut at my age a woman's follies ought to be justified by beauty, youth,\nfame, superior merit--some one of the splendid qualities which can\ndazzle us to the point of making us forget all else--even at our\nage. Though you may have fifty thousand francs a year, your age\ncounterbalances your fortune; thus you have nothing whatever of what a\nwoman looks for----\"\n\n\"But love!\" said the officer, rising and coming forward. \"Such love\nas----\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, such obstinacy!\" said the Baroness, interrupting him to\nput an end to his absurdity.\n\n\"Yes, obstinacy,\" said he, \"and love; but something stronger still--a\nclaim----\"\n\n\"A claim!\" cried Madame Hulot, rising sublime with scorn, defiance, and\nindignation. \"But,\" she went on, \"this will bring us to no issues; I\ndid not ask you to come here to discuss the matter which led to your\nbanishment in spite of the connection between our families----\"\n\n\"I had fancied so.\"\n\n\"What! still?\" cried she. \"Do you not see, monsieur, by the entire ease\nand freedom with which I can speak of lovers and love, of everything\nleast creditable to a woman, that I am perfectly secure in my own\nvirtue? I fear nothing--not even to shut myself in alone with you. Is\nthat the conduct of a weak woman? You know full well why I begged you to\ncome.\"\n\n\"No, madame,\" replied Crevel, with an assumption of great coldness. He\npursed up his lips, and again struck an attitude.\n\n\"Well, I will be brief, to shorten our common discomfort,\" said the\nBaroness, looking at Crevel.\n\nCrevel made an ironical bow, in which a man who knew the race would have\nrecognized the graces of a bagman.\n\n\"Our son married your daughter----\"\n\n\"And if it were to do again----\" said Crevel.\n\n\"It would not be done at all, I suspect,\" said the baroness hastily.\n\"However, you have nothing to complain of. My son is not only one of the\nleading pleaders of Paris, but for the last year he has sat as Deputy,\nand his maiden speech was brilliant enough to lead us to suppose that\nere long he will be in office. Victorin has twice been called upon to\nreport on important measures; and he might even now, if he chose, be\nmade Attorney-General in the Court of Appeal. So, if you mean to say\nthat your son-in-law has no fortune----\"\n\n\"Worse than that, madame, a son-in-law whom I am obliged to maintain,\"\nreplied Crevel. \"Of the five hundred thousand francs that formed my\ndaughter's marriage portion, two hundred thousand have vanished--God\nknows how!--in paying the young gentleman's debts, in furnishing his\nhouse splendaciously--a house costing five hundred thousand francs, and\nbringing in scarcely fifteen thousand, since he occupies the larger\npart of it, while he owes two hundred and sixty thousand francs of the\npurchase-money. The rent he gets barely pays the interest on the debt.\nI have had to give my daughter twenty thousand francs this year to\nhelp her to make both ends meet. And then my son-in-law, who was making\nthirty thousand francs a year at the Assizes, I am told, is going to\nthrow that up for the Chamber----\"\n\n\"This, again, Monsieur Crevel, is beside the mark; we are wandering from\nthe point. Still, to dispose of it finally, it may be said that if my\nson gets into office, if he has you made an officer of the Legion of\nHonor and councillor of the municipality of Paris, you, as a retired\nperfumer, will not have much to complain of----\"\n\n\"Ah! there we are again, madame! Yes, I am a tradesman, a shopkeeper,\na retail dealer in almond-paste, eau-de-Portugal, and hair-oil, and was\nonly too much honored when my only daughter was married to the son of\nMonsieur le Baron Hulot d'Ervy--my daughter will be a Baroness! This is\nRegency, Louis XV., (Eil-de-boeuf--quite tip-top!--very good.) I love\nCelestine as a man loves his only child--so well indeed, that, to\npreserve her from having either brother or sister, I resigned myself\nto all the privations of a widower--in Paris, and in the prime of life,\nmadame. But you must understand that, in spite of this extravagant\naffection for my daughter, I do not intend to reduce my fortune for the\nsake of your son, whose expenses are not wholly accounted for--in my\neyes, as an old man of business.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, you may at this day see in the Ministry of Commerce Monsieur\nPopinot, formerly a druggist in the Rue des Lombards----\"\n\n\"And a friend of mine, madame,\" said the ex-perfumer. \"For I, Celestin\nCrevel, foreman once to old Cesar Birotteau, brought up the said Cesar\nBirotteau's stock; and he was Popinot's father-in-law. Why, that very\nPopinot was no more than a shopman in the establishment, and he is the\nfirst to remind me of it; for he is not proud, to do him justice, to\nmen in a good position with an income of sixty thousand francs in the\nfunds.\"\n\n\"Well then, monsieur, the notions you term 'Regency' are quite out of\ndate at a time when a man is taken at his personal worth; and that is\nwhat you did when you married your daughter to my son.\"\n\n\"But you do not know how the marriage was brought about!\" cried Crevel.\n\"Oh, that cursed bachelor life! But for my misconduct, my Celestine\nmight at this day be Vicomtesse Popinot!\"\n\n\"Once more have done with recriminations over accomplished facts,\" said\nthe Baroness anxiously. \"Let us rather discuss the complaints I have\nfound on your strange behavior. My daughter Hortense had a chance of\nmarrying; the match depended entirely on you; I believed you felt some\nsentiments of generosity; I thought you would do justice to a woman who\nhas never had a thought in her heart for any man but her husband, that\nyou would have understood how necessary it is for her not to receive a\nman who may compromise her, and that for the honor of the family with\nwhich you are allied you would have been eager to promote Hortense's\nsettlement with Monsieur le Conseiller Lebas.--And it is you, monsieur,\nyou have hindered the marriage.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said the ex-perfumer, \"I acted the part of an honest man.\nI was asked whether the two hundred thousand francs to be settled on\nMademoiselle Hortense would be forthcoming. I replied exactly in these\nwords: 'I would not answer for it. My son-in-law, to whom the Hulots had\npromised the same sum, was in debt; and I believe that if Monsieur\nHulot d'Ervy were to die to-morrow, his widow would have nothing to live\non.'--There, fair lady.\"\n\n\"And would you have said as much, monsieur,\" asked Madame Hulot, looking\nCrevel steadily in the face, \"if I had been false to my duty?\"\n\n\"I should not be in a position to say it, dearest Adeline,\" cried this\nsingular adorer, interrupting the Baroness, \"for you would have found\nthe amount in my pocket-book.\"\n\nAnd adding action to word, the fat guardsman knelt down on one knee and\nkissed Madame Hulot's hand, seeing that his speech had filled her with\nspeechless horror, which he took for hesitancy.\n\n\"What, buy my daughter's fortune at the cost of----? Rise, monsieur--or\nI ring the bell.\"\n\nCrevel rose with great difficulty. This fact made him so furious that he\nagain struck his favorite attitude. Most men have some habitual position\nby which they fancy that they show to the best advantage the good\npoints bestowed on them by nature. This attitude in Crevel consisted in\ncrossing his arms like Napoleon, his head showing three-quarters face,\nand his eyes fixed on the horizon, as the painter has shown the Emperor\nin his portrait.\n\n\"To be faithful,\" he began, with well-acted indignation, \"so faithful to\na liber----\"\n\n\"To a husband who is worthy of such fidelity,\" Madame Hulot put in, to\nhinder Crevel from saying a word she did not choose to hear.\n\n\"Come, madame; you wrote to bid me here, you ask the reasons for my\nconduct, you drive me to extremities with your imperial airs, your\nscorn, and your contempt! Any one might think I was a Negro. But I\nrepeat it, and you may believe me, I have a right to--to make love to\nyou, for---- But no; I love you well enough to hold my tongue.\"\n\n\"You may speak, monsieur. In a few days I shall be eight-and-forty; I am\nno prude; I can hear whatever you can say.\"\n\n\"Then will you give me your word of honor as an honest woman--for you\nare, alas for me! an honest woman--never to mention my name or to say\nthat it was I who betrayed the secret?\"\n\n\"If that is the condition on which you speak, I will swear never to tell\nany one from whom I heard the horrors you propose to tell me, not even\nmy husband.\"\n\n\"I should think not indeed, for only you and he are concerned.\"\n\nMadame Hulot turned pale.\n\n\"Oh, if you still really love Hulot, it will distress you. Shall I say\nno more?\"\n\n\"Speak, monsieur; for by your account you wish to justify in my eyes\nthe extraordinary declarations you have chosen to make me, and your\npersistency in tormenting a woman of my age, whose only wish is to see\nher daughter married, and then--to die in peace----\"\n\n\"You see; you are unhappy.\"\n\n\"I, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Yes, beautiful, noble creature!\" cried Crevel. \"You have indeed been\ntoo wretched!\"\n\n\"Monsieur, be silent and go--or speak to me as you ought.\"\n\n\"Do you know, madame, how Master Hulot and I first made\nacquaintance?--At our mistresses', madame.\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur!\"\n\n\"Yes, madame, at our mistresses',\" Crevel repeated in a melodramatic\ntone, and leaving his position to wave his right hand.\n\n\"Well, and what then?\" said the Baroness coolly, to Crevel's great\namazement.\n\nSuch mean seducers cannot understand a great soul.\n\n\"I, a widower five years since,\" Crevel began, in the tone of a man who\nhas a story to tell, \"and not wishing to marry again for the sake of the\ndaughter I adore, not choosing either to cultivate any such connection\nin my own establishment, though I had at the time a very pretty\nlady-accountant. I set up, 'on her own account,' as they say, a little\nsempstress of fifteen--really a miracle of beauty, with whom I fell\ndesperately in love. And in fact, madame, I asked an aunt of my own,\nmy mother's sister, whom I sent for from the country, to live with the\nsweet creature and keep an eye on her, that she might behave as well\nas might be in this rather--what shall I say--shady?--no, delicate\nposition.\n\n\"The child, whose talent for music was striking, had masters, she was\neducated--I had to give her something to do. Besides, I wished to be at\nonce her father, her benefactor, and--well, out with it--her lover; to\nkill two birds with one stone, a good action and a sweetheart. For five\nyears I was very happy. The girl had one of those voices that make the\nfortune of a theatre; I can only describe her by saying that she is\na Duprez in petticoats. It cost me two thousand francs a year only to\ncultivate her talent as a singer. She made me music-mad; I took a box at\nthe opera for her and for my daughter, and went there alternate evenings\nwith Celestine or Josepha.\"\n\n\"What, the famous singer?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame,\" said Crevel with pride, \"the famous Josepha owes\neverything to me.--At last, in 1834, when the child was twenty,\nbelieving that I had attached her to me for ever, and being very weak\nwhere she was concerned, I thought I would give her a little amusement,\nand I introduced her to a pretty little actress, Jenny Cadine, whose\nlife had been somewhat like her own. This actress also owed everything\nto a protector who had brought her up in leading-strings. That protector\nwas Baron Hulot.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" said the Baroness, in a calm voice without the least\nagitation.\n\n\"Bless me!\" cried Crevel, more and more astounded. \"Well! But do you\nknow that your monster of a husband took Jenny Cadine in hand at the age\nof thirteen?\"\n\n\"What then?\" said the Baroness.\n\n\"As Jenny Cadine and Josepha were both aged twenty when they first met,\"\nthe ex-tradesman went on, \"the Baron had been playing the part of Louis\nXV. to Mademoiselle de Romans ever since 1826, and you were twelve years\nyounger then----\"\n\n\"I had my reasons, monsieur, for leaving Monsieur Hulot his liberty.\"\n\n\"That falsehood, madame, will surely be enough to wipe out every sin you\nhave ever committed, and to open to you the gates of Paradise,\" replied\nCrevel, with a knowing air that brought the color to the Baroness'\ncheeks. \"Sublime and adored woman, tell that to those who will believe\nit, but not to old Crevel, who has, I may tell you, feasted too often as\none of four with your rascally husband not to know what your high\nmerits are! Many a time has he blamed himself when half tipsy as he has\nexpatiated on your perfections. Oh, I know you well!--A libertine might\nhesitate between you and a girl of twenty. I do not hesitate----\"\n\n\"Monsieur!\"\n\n\"Well, I say no more. But you must know, saintly and noble woman, that\na husband under certain circumstances will tell things about his wife to\nhis mistress that will mightily amuse her.\"\n\nTears of shame hanging to Madame Hulot's long lashes checked the\nNational Guardsman. He stopped short, and forgot his attitude.\n\n\"To proceed,\" said he. \"We became intimate, the Baron and I, through\nthe two hussies. The Baron, like all bad lots, is very pleasant, a\nthoroughly jolly good fellow. Yes, he took my fancy, the old rascal. He\ncould be so funny!--Well, enough of those reminiscences. We got to be\nlike brothers. The scoundrel--quite Regency in his notions--tried indeed\nto deprave me altogether, preached Saint-Simonism as to women, and all\nsorts of lordly ideas; but, you see, I was fond enough of my girl to\nhave married her, only I was afraid of having children.\n\n\"Then between two old daddies, such friends as--as we were, what\nmore natural than that we should think of our children marrying each\nother?--Three months after his son had married my Celestine, Hulot--I\ndon't know how I can utter the wretch's name! he has cheated us both,\nmadame--well, the villain did me out of my little Josepha. The scoundrel\nknew that he was supplanted in the heart of Jenny Cadine by a young\nlawyer and by an artist--only two of them!--for the girl had more and\nmore of a howling success, and he stole my sweet little girl, a\nperfect darling--but you must have seen her at the opera; he got her\nan engagement there. Your husband is not so well behaved as I am. I am\nruled as straight as a sheet of music-paper. He had dropped a good deal\nof money on Jenny Cadine, who must have cost him near on thirty thousand\nfrancs a year. Well, I can only tell you that he is ruining himself\noutright for Josepha.\n\n\"Josepha, madame, is a Jewess. Her name is Mirah, the anagram of Hiram,\nan Israelite mark that stamps her, for she was a foundling picked up\nin Germany, and the inquiries I have made prove that she is the\nillegitimate child of a rich Jew banker. The life of the theatre, and,\nabove all, the teaching of Jenny Cadine, Madame Schontz, Malaga, and\nCarabine, as to the way to treat an old man, have developed, in the\nchild whom I had kept in a respectable and not too expensive way of\nlife, all the native Hebrew instinct for gold and jewels--for the golden\ncalf.\n\n\"So this famous singer, hungering for plunder, now wants to be rich,\nvery rich. She tried her 'prentice hand on Baron Hulot, and soon plucked\nhim bare--plucked him, ay, and singed him to the skin. The miserable\nman, after trying to vie with one of the Kellers and with the Marquis\nd'Esgrignon, both perfectly mad about Josepha, to say nothing of unknown\nworshipers, is about to see her carried off by that very rich Duke, who\nis such a patron of the arts. Oh, what is his name?--a dwarf.--Ah, the\nDuc d'Herouville. This fine gentleman insists on having Josepha for his\nvery own, and all that set are talking about it; the Baron knows nothing\nof it as yet; for it is the same in the Thirteenth Arrondissement as in\nevery other: the lover, like the husband, is last to get the news.\n\n\"Now, do you understand my claim? Your husband, dear lady, has robbed\nme of my joy in life, the only happiness I have known since I became a\nwidower. Yes, if I had not been so unlucky as to come across that old\nrip, Josepha would still be mine; for I, you know, should never have\nplaced her on the stage. She would have lived obscure, well conducted,\nand mine. Oh! if you could but have seen her eight years ago, slight and\nwiry, with the golden skin of an Andalusian, as they say, black hair as\nshiny as satin, an eye that flashed lightning under long brown lashes,\nthe style of a duchess in every movement, the modesty of a dependent,\ndecent grace, and the pretty ways of a wild fawn. And by that Hulot's\ndoing all this charm and purity has been degraded to a man-trap, a\nmoney-box for five-franc pieces! The girl is the Queen of Trollops;\nand nowadays she humbugs every one--she who knew nothing, not even that\nword.\"\n\nAt this stage the retired perfumer wiped his eyes, which were full of\ntears. The sincerity of his grief touched Madame Hulot, and roused her\nfrom the meditation into which she had sunk.\n\n\"Tell me, madame, is a man of fifty-two likely to find such another\njewel? At my age love costs thirty thousand francs a year. It is through\nyour husband's experience that I know the price, and I love Celestine\ntoo truly to be her ruin. When I saw you, at the first evening party\nyou gave in our honor, I wondered how that scoundrel Hulot could keep a\nJenny Cadine--you had the manner of an Empress. You do not look thirty,\"\nhe went on. \"To me, madame, you look young, and you are beautiful. On my\nword of honor, that evening I was struck to the heart. I said to myself,\n'If I had not Josepha, since old Hulot neglects his wife, she would fit\nme like a glove.' Forgive me--it is a reminiscence of my old business.\nThe perfumer will crop up now and then, and that is what keeps me from\nstanding to be elected deputy.\n\n\"And then, when I was so abominably deceived by the Baron, for really\nbetween old rips like us our friend's mistress should be sacred, I swore\nI would have his wife. It is but justice. The Baron could say nothing;\nwe are certain of impunity. You showed me the door like a mangy dog at\nthe first words I uttered as to the state of my feelings; you only made\nmy passion--my obstinacy, if you will--twice as strong, and you shall be\nmine.\"\n\n\"Indeed; how?\"\n\n\"I do not know; but it will come to pass. You see, madame, an idiot of\na perfumer--retired from business--who has but one idea in his head, is\nstronger than a clever fellow who has a thousand. I am smitten with\nyou, and you are the means of my revenge; it is like being in love twice\nover. I am speaking to you quite frankly, as a man who knows what he\nmeans. I speak coldly to you, just as you do to me, when you say, 'I\nnever will be yours,' In fact, as they say, I play the game with the\ncards on the table. Yes, you shall be mine, sooner or later; if you were\nfifty, you should still be my mistress. And it will be; for I expect\nanything from your husband!\"\n\nMadame Hulot looked at this vulgar intriguer with such a fixed stare of\nterror, that he thought she had gone mad, and he stopped.\n\n\"You insisted on it, you heaped me with scorn, you defied me--and I have\nspoken,\" said he, feeling that he must justify the ferocity of his last\nwords.\n\n\"Oh, my daughter, my daughter,\" moaned the Baroness in a voice like a\ndying woman's.\n\n\"Oh! I have forgotten all else,\" Crevel went on. \"The day when I was\nrobbed of Josepha I was like a tigress robbed of her cubs; in short,\nas you see me now.--Your daughter? Yes, I regard her as the means of\nwinning you. Yes, I put a spoke in her marriage--and you will not get\nher married without my help! Handsome as Mademoiselle Hortense is, she\nneeds a fortune----\"\n\n\"Alas! yes,\" said the Baroness, wiping her eyes.\n\n\"Well, just ask your husband for ten thousand francs,\" said Crevel,\nstriking his attitude once more. He waited a minute, like an actor who\nhas made a point.\n\n\"If he had the money, he would give it to the woman who will take\nJosepha's place,\" he went on, emphasizing his tones. \"Does a man ever\npull up on the road he has taken? In the first place, he is too sweet on\nwomen. There is a happy medium in all things, as our King has told us.\nAnd then his vanity is implicated! He is a handsome man!--He would\nbring you all to ruin for his pleasure; in fact, you are already on the\nhighroad to the workhouse. Why, look, never since I set foot in your\nhouse have you been able to do up your drawing-room furniture. 'Hard up'\nis the word shouted by every slit in the stuff. Where will you find a\nson-in-law who would not turn his back in horror of the ill-concealed\nevidence of the most cruel misery there is--that of people in decent\nsociety? I have kept shop, and I know. There is no eye so quick as that\nof the Paris tradesman to detect real wealth from its sham.--You have\nno money,\" he said, in a lower voice. \"It is written everywhere, even on\nyour man-servant's coat.\n\n\"Would you like me to disclose any more hideous mysteries that are kept\nfrom you?\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" cried Madame Hulot, whose handkerchief was wet through with\nher tears, \"enough, enough!\"\n\n\"My son-in-law, I tell you, gives his father money, and this is what I\nparticularly wanted to come to when I began by speaking of your son's\nexpenses. But I keep an eye on my daughter's interests, be easy.\"\n\n\"Oh, if I could but see my daughter married, and die!\" cried the poor\nwoman, quite losing her head.\n\n\"Well, then, this is the way,\" said the ex-perfumer.\n\nMadame Hulot looked at Crevel with a hopeful expression, which so\ncompletely changed her countenance, that this alone ought to have\ntouched the man's feelings and have led him to abandon his monstrous\nschemes.\n\n\"You will still be handsome ten years hence,\" Crevel went on, with his\narms folded; \"be kind to me, and Mademoiselle Hulot will marry. Hulot\nhas given me the right, as I have explained to you, to put the matter\ncrudely, and he will not be angry. In three years I have saved the\ninterest on my capital, for my dissipations have been restricted. I have\nthree hundred thousand francs in the bank over and above my invested\nfortune--they are yours----\"\n\n\"Go,\" said Madame Hulot. \"Go, monsieur, and never let me see you again.\nBut for the necessity in which you placed me to learn the secret of\nyour cowardly conduct with regard to the match I had planned for\nHortense--yes, cowardly!\" she repeated, in answer to a gesture from\nCrevel. \"How can you load a poor girl, a pretty, innocent creature,\nwith such a weight of enmity? But for the necessity that goaded me as a\nmother, you would never have spoken to me again, never again have come\nwithin my doors. Thirty-two years of an honorable and loyal life shall\nnot be swept away by a blow from Monsieur Crevel----\"\n\n\"The retired perfumer, successor to Cesar Birotteau at the _Queen of\nthe Roses_, Rue Saint-Honore,\" added Crevel, in mocking tones.\n\"Deputy-mayor, captain in the National Guard, Chevalier of the Legion of\nHonor--exactly what my predecessor was!\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the Baroness, \"if, after twenty years of constancy,\nMonsieur Hulot is tired of his wife, that is nobody's concern but mine.\nAs you see, he has kept his infidelity a mystery, for I did not know\nthat he had succeeded you in the affections of Mademoiselle Josepha----\"\n\n\"Oh, it has cost him a pretty penny, madame. His singing-bird has cost\nhim more than a hundred thousand francs in these two years. Ah, ha! you\nhave not seen the end of it!\"\n\n\"Have done with all this, Monsieur Crevel. I will not, for your sake,\nforego the happiness a mother knows who can embrace her children without\na single pang of remorse in her heart, who sees herself respected and\nloved by her family; and I will give up my soul to God unspotted----\"\n\n\"Amen!\" exclaimed Crevel, with the diabolical rage that embitters the\nface of these pretenders when they fail for the second time in such\nan attempt. \"You do not yet know the latter end of poverty--shame,\ndisgrace.--I have tried to warn you; I would have saved you, you and\nyour daughter. Well, you must study the modern parable of the _Prodigal\nFather_ from A to Z. Your tears and your pride move me deeply,\" said\nCrevel, seating himself, \"for it is frightful to see the woman one loves\nweeping. All I can promise you, dear Adeline, is to do nothing against\nyour interests or your husband's. Only never send to me for information.\nThat is all.\"\n\n\"What is to be done?\" cried Madame Hulot.\n\nUp to now the Baroness had bravely faced the threefold torment which\nthis explanation inflicted on her; for she was wounded as a woman, as a\nmother, and as a wife. In fact, so long as her son's father-in-law was\ninsolent and offensive, she had found the strength in her resistance\nto the aggressive tradesman; but the sort of good-nature he showed,\nin spite of his exasperation as a mortified adorer and as a humiliated\nNational Guardsman, broke down her nerve, strung to the point of\nsnapping. She wrung her hands, melted into tears, and was in a state of\nsuch helpless dejection, that she allowed Crevel to kneel at her feet,\nkissing her hands.\n\n\"Good God! what will become of us!\" she went on, wiping away her tears.\n\"Can a mother sit still and see her child pine away before her eyes?\nWhat is to be the fate of that splendid creature, as strong in her pure\nlife under her mother's care as she is by every gift of nature? There\nare days when she wanders round the garden, out of spirits without\nknowing why; I find her with tears in her eyes----\"\n\n\"She is one-and-twenty,\" said Crevel.\n\n\"Must I place her in a convent?\" asked the Baroness. \"But in such cases\nreligion is impotent to subdue nature, and the most piously trained\ngirls lose their head!--Get up, pray, monsieur; do you not understand\nthat everything is final between us? that I look upon you with horror?\nthat you have crushed a mother's last hopes----\"\n\n\"But if I were to restore them,\" asked he.\n\nMadame Hulot looked at Crevel with a frenzied expression that really\ntouched him. But he drove pity back to the depths of his heart; she had\nsaid, \"I look upon you with horror.\"\n\nVirtue is always a little too rigid; it overlooks the shades and\ninstincts by help of which we are able to tack when in a false position.\n\n\"So handsome a girl as Mademoiselle Hortense does not find a husband\nnowadays if she is penniless,\" Crevel remarked, resuming his starchiest\nmanner. \"Your daughter is one of those beauties who rather alarm\nintending husbands; like a thoroughbred horse, which is too expensive\nto keep up to find a ready purchaser. If you go out walking with such\na woman on your arm, every one will turn to look at you, and follow and\ncovet his neighbor's wife. Such success is a source of much uneasiness\nto men who do not want to be killing lovers; for, after all, no man\nkills more than one. In the position in which you find yourself there\nare just three ways of getting your daughter married: Either by my\nhelp--and you will have none of it! That is one.--Or by finding some old\nman of sixty, very rich, childless, and anxious to have children; that\nis difficult, still such men are to be met with. Many old men take up\nwith a Josepha, a Jenny Cadine, why should not one be found who is ready\nto make a fool of himself under legal formalities? If it were not for\nCelestine and our two grandchildren, I would marry Hortense myself. That\nis two.--The last way is the easiest----\"\n\nMadame Hulot raised her head, and looked uneasily at the ex-perfumer.\n\n\"Paris is a town whither every man of energy--and they sprout like\nsaplings on French soil--comes to meet his kind; talent swarms here\nwithout hearth or home, and energy equal to anything, even to making a\nfortune. Well, these youngsters--your humble servant was such a one\nin his time, and how many he has known! What had du Tillet or Popinot\ntwenty years since? They were both pottering round in Daddy Birotteau's\nshop, with not a penny of capital but their determination to get on,\nwhich, in my opinion, is the best capital a man can have. Money may be\neaten through, but you don't eat through your determination. Why, what\nhad I? The will to get on, and plenty of pluck. At this day du Tillet is\na match for the greatest folks; little Popinot, the richest druggist of\nthe Rue des Lombards, became a deputy, now he is in office.--Well, one\nof these free lances, as we say on the stock market, of the pen, or of\nthe brush, is the only man in Paris who would marry a penniless beauty,\nfor they have courage enough for anything. Monsieur Popinot married\nMademoiselle Birotteau without asking for a farthing. Those men are\nmadmen, to be sure! They trust in love as they trust in good luck and\nbrains!--Find a man of energy who will fall in love with your daughter,\nand he will marry without a thought of money. You must confess that by\nway of an enemy I am not ungenerous, for this advice is against my own\ninterests.\"\n\n\"Oh, Monsieur Crevel, if you would indeed be my friend and give up your\nridiculous notions----\"\n\n\"Ridiculous? Madame, do not run yourself down. Look at yourself--I love\nyou, and you will come to be mine. The day will come when I shall say to\nHulot, 'You took Josepha, I have taken your wife!'\n\n\"It is the old law of tit-for-tat! And I will persevere till I have\nattained my end, unless you should become extremely ugly.--I shall\nsucceed; and I will tell you why,\" he went on, resuming his attitude,\nand looking at Madame Hulot. \"You will not meet with such an old man,\nor such a young lover,\" he said after a pause, \"because you love\nyour daughter too well to hand her over to the manoeuvres of an old\nlibertine, and because you--the Baronne Hulot, sister of the old\nLieutenant-General who commanded the veteran Grenadiers of the Old\nGuard--will not condescend to take a man of spirit wherever you may find\nhim; for he might be a mere craftsman, as many a millionaire of to-day\nwas ten years ago, a working artisan, or the foreman of a factory.\n\n\"And then, when you see the girl, urged by her twenty years, capable of\ndishonoring you all, you will say to yourself, 'It will be better that I\nshould fall! If Monsieur Crevel will but keep my secret, I will earn\nmy daughter's portion--two hundred thousand francs for ten years'\nattachment to that old gloveseller--old Crevel!'--I disgust you no\ndoubt, and what I am saying is horribly immoral, you think? But if you\nhappened to have been bitten by an overwhelming passion, you would find\na thousand arguments in favor of yielding--as women do when they are in\nlove.--Yes, and Hortense's interests will suggest to your feelings such\nterms of surrendering your conscience----\"\n\n\"Hortense has still an uncle.\"\n\n\"What! Old Fischer? He is winding up his concerns, and that again is the\nBaron's fault; his rake is dragged over every till within his reach.\"\n\n\"Comte Hulot----\"\n\n\"Oh, madame, your husband has already made thin air of the old General's\nsavings. He spent them in furnishing his singer's rooms.--Now, come; am\nI to go without a hope?\"\n\n\"Good-bye, monsieur. A man easily gets over a passion for a woman of my\nage, and you will fall back on Christian principles. God takes care of\nthe wretched----\"\n\nThe Baroness rose to oblige the captain to retreat, and drove him back\ninto the drawing-room.\n\n\"Ought the beautiful Madame Hulot to be living amid such squalor?\" said\nhe, and he pointed to an old lamp, a chandelier bereft of its gilding,\nthe threadbare carpet, the very rags of wealth which made the large\nroom, with its red, white, and gold, look like a corpse of Imperial\nfestivities.\n\n\"Monsieur, virtue shines on it all. I have no wish to owe a handsome\nabode to having made of the beauty you are pleased to ascribe to me a\n_man-trap_ and _a money-box for five-franc pieces_!\"\n\nThe captain bit his lips as he recognized the words he had used to\nvilify Josepha's avarice.\n\n\"And for whom are you so magnanimous?\" said he. By this time the\nbaroness had got her rejected admirer as far as the door.--\"For a\nlibertine!\" said he, with a lofty grimace of virtue and superior wealth.\n\n\"If you are right, my constancy has some merit, monsieur. That is all.\"\n\nAfter bowing to the officer as a woman bows to dismiss an importune\nvisitor, she turned away too quickly to see him once more fold his arms.\nShe unlocked the doors she had closed, and did not see the threatening\ngesture which was Crevel's parting greeting. She walked with a proud,\ndefiant step, like a martyr to the Coliseum, but her strength was\nexhausted; she sank on the sofa in her blue room, as if she were\nready to faint, and sat there with her eyes fixed on the tumble-down\nsummer-house, where her daughter was gossiping with Cousin Betty.\n\n\n\nFrom the first days of her married life to the present time the Baroness\nhad loved her husband, as Josephine in the end had loved Napoleon, with\nan admiring, maternal, and cowardly devotion. Though ignorant of the\ndetails given her by Crevel, she knew that for twenty years past Baron\nHulot been anything rather than a faithful husband; but she had sealed\nher eyes with lead, she had wept in silence, and no word of reproach had\never escaped her. In return for this angelic sweetness, she had won her\nhusband's veneration and something approaching to worship from all who\nwere about her.\n\nA wife's affection for her husband and the respect she pays him are\ninfectious in a family. Hortense believed her father to be a perfect\nmodel of conjugal affection; as to their son, brought up to admire the\nBaron, whom everybody regarded as one of the giants who so effectually\nbacked Napoleon, he knew that he owed his advancement to his father's\nname, position, and credit; and besides, the impressions of childhood\nexert an enduring influence. He still was afraid of his father; and if\nhe had suspected the misdeeds revealed by Crevel, as he was too much\noverawed by him to find fault, he would have found excuses in the view\nevery man takes of such matters.\n\nIt now will be necessary to give the reasons for the extraordinary\nself-devotion of a good and beautiful woman; and this, in a few words,\nis her past history.\n\n\n\nThree brothers, simple laboring men, named Fischer, and living in a\nvillage situated on the furthest frontier of Lorraine, were compelled\nby the Republican conscription to set out with the so-called army of the\nRhine.\n\nIn 1799 the second brother, Andre, a widower, and Madame Hulot's father,\nleft his daughter to the care of his elder brother, Pierre Fischer,\ndisabled from service by a wound received in 1797, and made a small\nprivate venture in the military transport service, an opening he owed to\nthe favor of Hulot d'Ervy, who was high in the commissariat. By a very\nobvious chance Hulot, coming to Strasbourg, saw the Fischer family.\nAdeline's father and his younger brother were at that time contractors\nfor forage in the province of Alsace.\n\nAdeline, then sixteen years of age, might be compared with the famous\nMadame du Barry, like her, a daughter of Lorraine. She was one of those\nperfect and striking beauties--a woman like Madame Tallien, finished\nwith peculiar care by Nature, who bestows on them all her choicest\ngifts--distinction, dignity, grace, refinement, elegance, flesh of a\nsuperior texture, and a complexion mingled in the unknown laboratory\nwhere good luck presides. These beautiful creatures all have something\nin common: Bianca Capella, whose portrait is one of Bronzino's\nmasterpieces; Jean Goujon's Venus, painted from the famous Diane de\nPoitiers; Signora Olympia, whose picture adorns the Doria gallery;\nNinon, Madame du Barry, Madame Tallien, Mademoiselle Georges, Madame\nRecamier.--all these women who preserved their beauty in spite of years,\nof passion, and of their life of excess and pleasure, have in\nfigure, frame, and in the character of their beauty certain striking\nresemblances, enough to make one believe that there is in the ocean of\ngenerations an Aphrodisian current whence every such Venus is born, all\ndaughters of the same salt wave.\n\nAdeline Fischer, one of the loveliest of this race of goddesses, had the\nsplendid type, the flowing lines, the exquisite texture of a woman born\na queen. The fair hair that our mother Eve received from the hand of\nGod, the form of an Empress, an air of grandeur, and an august line of\nprofile, with her rural modesty, made every man pause in delight as she\npassed, like amateurs in front of a Raphael; in short, having once seen\nher, the Commissariat officer made Mademoiselle Adeline Fischer his wife\nas quickly as the law would permit, to the great astonishment of the\nFischers, who had all been brought up in the fear of their betters.\n\nThe eldest, a soldier of 1792, severely wounded in the attack on the\nlines at Wissembourg, adored the Emperor Napoleon and everything that\nhad to do with the _Grande Armee_. Andre and Johann spoke with respect\nof Commissary Hulot, the Emperor's protege, to whom indeed they owed\ntheir prosperity; for Hulot d'Ervy, finding them intelligent and honest,\nhad taken them from the army provision wagons to place them in charge\nof a government contract needing despatch. The brothers Fischer had\ndone further service during the campaign of 1804. At the peace Hulot had\nsecured for them the contract for forage from Alsace, not knowing that\nhe would presently be sent to Strasbourg to prepare for the campaign of\n1806.\n\nThis marriage was like an Assumption to the young peasant girl. The\nbeautiful Adeline was translated at once from the mire of her village to\nthe paradise of the Imperial Court; for the contractor, one of the most\nconscientious and hard-working of the Commissariat staff, was made\na Baron, obtained a place near the Emperor, and was attached to the\nImperial Guard. The handsome rustic bravely set to work to educate\nherself for love of her husband, for she was simply crazy about him;\nand, indeed, the Commissariat office was as a man a perfect match for\nAdeline as a woman. He was one of the picked corps of fine men. Tall,\nwell-built, fair, with beautiful blue eyes full of irresistible fire and\nlife, his elegant appearance made him remarkable by the side of d'Orsay,\nForbin, Ouvrard; in short, in the battalion of fine men that surrounded\nthe Emperor. A conquering \"buck,\" and holding the ideas of the\nDirectoire with regard to women, his career of gallantry was interrupted\nfor some long time by his conjugal affection.\n\nTo Adeline the Baron was from the first a sort of god who could do no\nwrong. To him she owed everything: fortune--she had a carriage, a fine\nhouse, every luxury of the day; happiness--he was devoted to her in the\nface of the world; a title, for she was a Baroness; fame, for she was\nspoken of as the beautiful Madame Hulot--and in Paris! Finally, she had\nthe honor of refusing the Emperor's advances, for Napoleon made her a\npresent of a diamond necklace, and always remembered her, asking now and\nagain, \"And is the beautiful Madame Hulot still a model of virtue?\" in\nthe tone of a man who might have taken his revenge on one who should\nhave triumphed where he had failed.\n\nSo it needs no great intuition to discern what were the motives in a\nsimple, guileless, and noble soul for the fanaticism of Madame Hulot's\nlove. Having fully persuaded herself that her husband could do her no\nwrong, she made herself in the depths of her heart the humble, abject,\nand blindfold slave of the man who had made her. It must be noted, too,\nthat she was gifted with great good sense--the good sense of the people,\nwhich made her education sound. In society she spoke little, and never\nspoke evil of any one; she did not try to shine; she thought out\nmany things, listened well, and formed herself on the model of the\nbest-conducted women of good birth.\n\nIn 1815 Hulot followed the lead of the Prince de Wissembourg, his\nintimate friend, and became one of the officers who organized the\nimprovised troops whose rout brought the Napoleonic cycle to a close at\nWaterloo. In 1816 the Baron was one of the men best hated by the Feltre\nadministration, and was not reinstated in the Commissariat till 1823,\nwhen he was needed for the Spanish war. In 1830 he took office as\nthe fourth wheel of the coach, at the time of the levies, a sort of\nconscription made by Louis Philippe on the old Napoleonic soldiery. From\nthe time when the younger branch ascended the throne, having taken an\nactive part in bringing that about, he was regarded as an indispensable\nauthority at the War Office. He had already won his Marshal's baton,\nand the King could do no more for him unless by making him minister or a\npeer of France.\n\nFrom 1818 till 1823, having no official occupation, Baron Hulot had gone\non active service to womankind. Madame Hulot dated her Hector's first\ninfidelities from the grand _finale_ of the Empire. Thus, for twelve\nyears the Baroness had filled the part in her household of _prima donna\nassoluta_, without a rival. She still could boast of the old-fashioned,\ninveterate affection which husbands feel for wives who are resigned to\nbe gentle and virtuous helpmates; she knew that if she had a rival,\nthat rival would not subsist for two hours under a word of reproof from\nherself; but she shut her eyes, she stopped her ears, she would know\nnothing of her husband's proceedings outside his home. In short, she\ntreated her Hector as a mother treats a spoilt child.\n\nThree years before the conversation reported above, Hortense, at\nthe Theatre des Varietes, had recognized her father in a lower tier\nstage-box with Jenny Cadine, and had exclaimed:\n\n\"There is papa!\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, my darling; he is at the Marshal's,\" the Baroness\nreplied.\n\nShe too had seen Jenny Cadine; but instead of feeling a pang when she\nsaw how pretty she was, she said to herself, \"That rascal Hector must\nthink himself very lucky.\"\n\nShe suffered nevertheless; she gave herself up in secret to rages of\ntorment; but as soon as she saw Hector, she always remembered her twelve\nyears of perfect happiness, and could not find it in her to utter a word\nof complaint. She would have been glad if the Baron would have taken her\ninto his confidence; but she never dared to let him see that she knew\nof his kicking over the traces, out of respect for her husband. Such\nan excess of delicacy is never met with but in those grand creatures,\ndaughters of the soil, whose instinct it is to take blows without ever\nreturning them; the blood of the early martyrs still lives in their\nveins. Well-born women, their husbands' equals, feel the impulse to\nannoy them, to mark the points of their tolerance, like points at\nbilliards, by some stinging word, partly in the spirit of diabolical\nmalice, and to secure the upper hand or the right of turning the tables.\n\nThe Baroness had an ardent admirer in her brother-in-law,\nLieutenant-General Hulot, the venerable Colonel of the Grenadiers of the\nImperial Infantry Guard, who was to have a Marshal's baton in his old\nage. This veteran, after having served from 1830 to 1834 as Commandant\nof the military division, including the departments of Brittany, the\nscene of his exploits in 1799 and 1800, had come to settle in Paris near\nhis brother, for whom he had a fatherly affection.\n\nThis old soldier's heart was in sympathy with his sister-in-law; he\nadmired her as the noblest and saintliest of her sex. He had never\nmarried, because he hoped to find a second Adeline, though he had vainly\nsought for her through twenty campaigns in as many lands. To\nmaintain her place in the esteem of this blameless and spotless old\nrepublican--of whom Napoleon had said, \"That brave old Hulot is the most\nobstinate republican, but he will never be false to me\"--Adeline would\nhave endured griefs even greater than those that had just come upon\nher. But the old soldier, seventy-two years of age, battered by thirty\ncampaigns, and wounded for the twenty-seventh time at Waterloo, was\nAdeline's admirer, and not a \"protector.\" The poor old Count, among\nother infirmities, could only hear through a speaking trumpet.\n\nSo long as Baron Hulot d'Ervy was a fine man, his flirtations did not\ndamage his fortune; but when a man is fifty, the Graces claim payment.\nAt that age love becomes vice; insensate vanities come into play.\nThus, at about that time, Adeline saw that her husband was incredibly\nparticular about his dress; he dyed his hair and whiskers, and wore a\nbelt and stays. He was determined to remain handsome at any cost. This\ncare of his person, a weakness he had once mercilessly mocked at, was\ncarried out in the minutest details.\n\nAt last Adeline perceived that the Pactolus poured out before the\nBaron's mistresses had its source in her pocket. In eight years he had\ndissipated a considerable amount of money; and so effectually, that, on\nhis son's marriage two years previously, the Baron had been compelled to\nexplain to his wife that his pay constituted their whole income.\n\n\"What shall we come to?\" asked Adeline.\n\n\"Be quite easy,\" said the official, \"I will leave the whole of my salary\nin your hands, and I will make a fortune for Hortense, and some savings\nfor the future, in business.\"\n\nThe wife's deep belief in her husband's power and superior talents, in\nhis capabilities and character, had, in fact, for the moment allayed her\nanxiety.\n\nWhat the Baroness' reflections and tears were after Crevel's departure\nmay now be clearly imagined. The poor woman had for two years past known\nthat she was at the bottom of a pit, but she had fancied herself alone\nin it. How her son's marriage had been finally arranged she had not\nknown; she had known nothing of Hector's connection with the grasping\nJewess; and, above all, she hoped that no one in the world knew anything\nof her troubles. Now, if Crevel went about so ready to talk of the\nBaron's excesses, Hector's reputation would suffer. She could see, under\nthe angry ex-perfumer's coarse harangue, the odious gossip behind the\nscenes which led to her son's marriage. Two reprobate hussies had been\nthe priestesses of this union planned at some orgy amid the degrading\nfamiliarities of two tipsy old sinners.\n\n\"And has he forgotten Hortense!\" she wondered.\n\n\"But he sees her every day; will he try to find her a husband among his\ngood-for-nothing sluts?\"\n\nAt this moment it was the mother that spoke rather than the wife, for\nshe saw Hortense laughing with her Cousin Betty--the reckless laughter\nof heedless youth; and she knew that such hysterical laughter was quite\nas distressing a symptom as the tearful reverie of solitary walks in the\ngarden.\n\nHortense was like her mother, with golden hair that waved naturally,\nand was amazingly long and thick. Her skin had the lustre of\nmother-of-pearl. She was visibly the offspring of a true marriage, of a\npure and noble love in its prime. There was a passionate vitality in\nher countenance, a brilliancy of feature, a full fount of youth, a fresh\nvigor and abundance of health, which radiated from her with electric\nflashes. Hortense invited the eye.\n\nWhen her eye, of deep ultramarine blue, liquid with the moisture of\ninnocent youth, rested on a passer-by, he was involuntarily thrilled.\nNor did a single freckle mar her skin, such as those with which many\na white and golden maid pays toll for her milky whiteness. Tall, round\nwithout being fat, with a slender dignity as noble as her mother's,\nshe really deserved the name of goddess, of which old authors were\nso lavish. In fact, those who saw Hortense in the street could hardly\nrestrain the exclamation, \"What a beautiful girl!\"\n\nShe was so genuinely innocent, that she could say to her mother:\n\n\"What do they mean, mamma, by calling me a beautiful girl when I am with\nyou? Are not you much handsomer than I am?\"\n\nAnd, in point of fact, at seven-and-forty the Baroness might have been\npreferred to her daughter by amateurs of sunset beauty; for she had\nnot yet lost any of her charms, by one of those phenomena which are\nespecially rare in Paris, where Ninon was regarded as scandalous, simply\nbecause she thus seemed to enjoy such an unfair advantage over the\nplainer women of the seventeenth century.\n\nThinking of her daughter brought her back to the father; she saw him\nsinking by degrees, day after day, down to the social mire, and even\ndismissed some day from his appointment. The idea of her idol's fall,\nwith a vague vision of the disasters prophesied by Crevel, was such a\nterror to the poor woman, that she became rapt in the contemplation like\nan ecstatic.\n\nCousin Betty, from time to time, as she chatted with Hortense, looked\nround to see when they might return to the drawing-room; but her young\ncousin was pelting her with questions, and at the moment when the\nBaroness opened the glass door she did not happen to be looking.\n\n\n\nLisbeth Fischer, though the daughter of the eldest of the three\nbrothers, was five years younger than Madame Hulot; she was far from\nbeing as handsome as her cousin, and had been desperately jealous of\nAdeline. Jealousy was the fundamental passion of this character, marked\nby eccentricities--a word invented by the English to describe the\ncraziness not of the asylum, but of respectable households. A native\nof the Vosges, a peasant in the fullest sense of the word, lean, brown,\nwith shining black hair and thick eyebrows joining in a tuft, with long,\nstrong arms, thick feet, and some moles on her narrow simian face--such\nis a brief description of the elderly virgin.\n\nThe family, living all under one roof, had sacrificed the common-looking\ngirl to the beauty, the bitter fruit to the splendid flower. Lisbeth\nworked in the fields, while her cousin was indulged; and one day, when\nthey were alone together, she had tried to destroy Adeline's nose, a\ntruly Greek nose, which the old mothers admired. Though she was beaten\nfor this misdeed, she persisted nevertheless in tearing the favorite's\ngowns and crumpling her collars.\n\nAt the time of Adeline's wonderful marriage, Lisbeth had bowed to fate,\nas Napoleon's brothers and sisters bowed before the splendor of the\nthrone and the force of authority.\n\nAdeline, who was extremely sweet and kind, remembered Lisbeth when she\nfound herself in Paris, and invited her there in 1809, intending to\nrescue her from poverty by finding her a husband. But seeing that it was\nimpossible to marry the girl out of hand, with her black eyes and sooty\nbrows, unable, too, to read or write, the Baron began by apprenticing\nher to a business; he placed her as a learner with the embroiderers to\nthe Imperial Court, the well-known Pons Brothers.\n\nLisbeth, called Betty for short, having learned to embroider in gold\nand silver, and possessing all the energy of a mountain race, had\ndetermination enough to learn to read, write, and keep accounts; for her\ncousin the Baron had pointed out the necessity for these accomplishments\nif she hoped to set up in business as an embroiderer.\n\nShe was bent on making a fortune; in two years she was another creature.\nIn 1811 the peasant woman had become a very presentable, skilled, and\nintelligent forewoman.\n\nHer department, that of gold and silver lace-work, as it is called,\nincluded epaulettes, sword-knots, aiguillettes; in short, the immense\nmass of glittering ornaments that sparkled on the rich uniforms of the\nFrench army and civil officials. The Emperor, a true Italian in his love\nof dress, had overlaid the coats of all his servants with silver and\ngold, and the Empire included a hundred and thirty-three Departments.\nThese ornaments, usually supplied to tailors who were solvent and\nwealthy paymasters, were a very secure branch of trade.\n\nJust when Cousin Betty, the best hand in the house of Pons Brothers,\nwhere she was forewoman of the embroidery department, might have set up\nin business on her own account, the Empire collapsed. The olive-branch\nof peace held out by the Bourbons did not reassure Lisbeth; she feared\na diminution of this branch of trade, since henceforth there were to\nbe but eighty-six Departments to plunder, instead of a hundred and\nthirty-three, to say nothing of the immense reduction of the army.\nUtterly scared by the ups and downs of industry, she refused the Baron's\noffers of help, and he thought she must be mad. She confirmed this\nopinion by quarreling with Monsieur Rivet, who bought the business\nof Pons Brothers, and with whom the Baron wished to place her in\npartnership; she would be no more than a workwoman. Thus the Fischer\nfamily had relapsed into the precarious mediocrity from which Baron\nHulot had raised it.\n\nThe three brothers Fischer, who had been ruined by the abdication at\nFontainebleau, in despair joined the irregular troops in 1815. The\neldest, Lisbeth's father, was killed. Adeline's father, sentenced to\ndeath by court-martial, fled to Germany, and died at Treves in 1820.\nJohann, the youngest, came to Paris, a petitioner to the queen of the\nfamily, who was said to dine off gold and silver plate, and never to\nbe seen at a party but with diamonds in her hair as big as hazel-nuts,\ngiven to her by the Emperor.\n\nJohann Fischer, then aged forty-three, obtained from Baron Hulot a\ncapital of ten thousand francs with which to start a small business\nas forage-dealer at Versailles, under the patronage of the War Office,\nthrough the influence of the friends still in office, of the late\nCommissary-General.\n\nThese family catastrophes, Baron Hulot's dismissal, and the knowledge\nthat he was a mere cipher in that immense stir of men and interests and\nthings which makes Paris at once a paradise and a hell, quite quelled\nLisbeth Fischer. She gave up all idea of rivalry and comparison with her\ncousin after feeling her great superiority; but envy still lurked in\nher heart, like a plague-germ that may hatch and devastate a city if the\nfatal bale of wool is opened in which it is concealed.\n\nNow and again, indeed, she said to herself:\n\n\"Adeline and I are the same flesh and blood, our fathers were\nbrothers--and she is in a mansion, while I am in a garret.\"\n\nBut every New Year Lisbeth had presents from the Baron and Baroness; the\nBaron, who was always good to her, paid for her firewood in the winter;\nold General Hulot had her to dinner once a week; and there was always a\ncover laid for her at her cousin's table. They laughed at her no doubt,\nbut they never were ashamed to own her. In short, they had made her\nindependent in Paris, where she lived as she pleased.\n\nThe old maid had, in fact, a terror of any kind of tie. Her cousin had\noffered her a room in her own house--Lisbeth suspected the halter of\ndomestic servitude; several times the Baron had found a solution of\nthe difficult problem of her marriage; but though tempted in the first\ninstance, she would presently decline, fearing lest she should be\nscorned for her want of education, her general ignorance, and her\npoverty; finally, when the Baroness suggested that she should live\nwith their uncle Johann, and keep house for him, instead of the upper\nservant, who must cost him dear, Lisbeth replied that that was the very\nlast way she should think of marrying.\n\nLisbeth Fischer had the sort of strangeness in her ideas which is often\nnoticeable in characters that have developed late, in savages, who think\nmuch and speak little. Her peasant's wit had acquired a good deal of\nParisian asperity from hearing the talk of workshops and mixing with\nworkmen and workwomen. She, whose character had a marked resemblance to\nthat of the Corsicans, worked upon without fruition by the instincts of\na strong nature, would have liked to be the protectress of a weak man;\nbut, as a result of living in the capital, the capital had altered her\nsuperficially. Parisian polish became rust on this coarsely tempered\nsoul. Gifted with a cunning which had become unfathomable, as it always\ndoes in those whose celibacy is genuine, with the originality and\nsharpness with which she clothed her ideas, in any other position she\nwould have been formidable. Full of spite, she was capable of bringing\ndiscord into the most united family.\n\nIn early days, when she indulged in certain secret hopes which she\nconfided to none, she took to wearing stays, and dressing in the\nfashion, and so shone in splendor for a short time, that the Baron\nthought her marriageable. Lisbeth at that stage was the piquante\nbrunette of old-fashioned novels. Her piercing glance, her olive\nskin, her reed-like figure, might invite a half-pay major; but she was\nsatisfied, she would say laughing, with her own admiration.\n\nAnd, indeed, she found her life pleasant enough when she had freed it\nfrom practical anxieties, for she dined out every evening after working\nhard from sunrise. Thus she had only her rent and her midday meal to\nprovide for; she had most of her clothes given her, and a variety of\nvery acceptable stores, such as coffee, sugar, wine, and so forth.\n\nIn 1837, after living for twenty-seven years, half maintained by the\nHulots and her Uncle Fischer, Cousin Betty, resigned to being nobody,\nallowed herself to be treated so. She herself refused to appear at any\ngrand dinners, preferring the family party, where she held her own and\nwas spared all slights to her pride.\n\nWherever she went--at General Hulot's, at Crevel's, at the house of the\nyoung Hulots, or at Rivet's (Pons' successor, with whom she made up her\nquarrel, and who made much of her), and at the Baroness' table--she was\ntreated as one of the family; in fact, she managed to make friends of\nthe servants by making them an occasional small present, and\nalways gossiping with them for a few minutes before going into the\ndrawing-room. This familiarity, by which she uncompromisingly put\nherself on their level, conciliated their servile good-nature, which\nis indispensable to a parasite. \"She is a good, steady woman,\" was\neverybody's verdict.\n\nHer willingness to oblige, which knew no bounds when it was not demanded\nof her, was indeed, like her assumed bluntness, a necessity of her\nposition. She had at length understood what her life must be, seeing\nthat she was at everybody's mercy; and needing to please everybody, she\nwould laugh with young people, who liked her for a sort of wheedling\nflattery which always wins them; guessing and taking part with their\nfancies, she would make herself their spokeswoman, and they thought her\na delightful _confidante_, since she had no right to find fault with\nthem.\n\nHer absolute secrecy also won her the confidence of their seniors; for,\nlike Ninon, she had certain manly qualities. As a rule, our confidence\nis given to those below rather than above us. We employ our inferiors\nrather than our betters in secret transactions, and they thus become\nthe recipients of our inmost thoughts, and look on at our meditations;\nRichelieu thought he had achieved success when he was admitted to the\nCouncil. This penniless woman was supposed to be so dependent on every\none about her, that she seemed doomed to perfect silence. She herself\ncalled herself the Family Confessional.\n\nThe Baroness only, remembering her ill-usage in childhood by the cousin\nwho, though younger, was stronger than herself, never wholly trusted\nher. Besides, out of sheer modesty, she would never have told her\ndomestic sorrows to any one but God.\n\nIt may here be well to add that the Baron's house preserved all its\nmagnificence in the eyes of Lisbeth Fischer, who was not struck, as the\nparvenu perfumer had been, with the penury stamped on the shabby chairs,\nthe dirty hangings, and the ripped silk. The furniture we live with is\nin some sort like our own person; seeing ourselves every day, we end,\nlike the Baron, by thinking ourselves but little altered, and still\nyouthful, when others see that our head is covered with chinchilla,\nour forehead scarred with circumflex accents, our stomach assuming the\nrotundity of a pumpkin. So these rooms, always blazing in Betty's\neyes with the Bengal fire of Imperial victory, were to her perennially\nsplendid.\n\nAs time went on, Lisbeth had contracted some rather strange old-maidish\nhabits. For instance, instead of following the fashions, she expected\nthe fashion to accept her ways and yield to her always out-of-date\nnotions. When the Baroness gave her a pretty new bonnet, or a gown in\nthe fashion of the day, Betty remade it completely at home, and spoilt\nit by producing a dress of the style of the Empire or of her old\nLorraine costume. A thirty-franc bonnet came out a rag, and the gown a\ndisgrace. On this point, Lisbeth was as obstinate as a mule; she would\nplease no one but herself and believed herself charming; whereas this\nassimilative process--harmonious, no doubt, in so far as that it stamped\nher for an old maid from head to foot--made her so ridiculous, that,\nwith the best will in the world, no one could admit her on any smart\noccasion.\n\nThis refractory, capricious, and independent spirit, and the\ninexplicable wild shyness of the woman for whom the Baron had four\ntimes found a match--an employe in his office, a retired major, an\narmy contractor, and a half-pay captain--while she had refused an army\nlacemaker, who had since made his fortune, had won her the name of the\nNanny Goat, which the Baron gave her in jest. But this nickname only met\nthe peculiarities that lay on the surface, the eccentricities which\neach of us displays to his neighbors in social life. This woman, who, if\nclosely studied, would have shown the most savage traits of the peasant\nclass, was still the girl who had clawed her cousin's nose, and who, if\nshe had not been trained to reason, would perhaps have killed her in a\nfit of jealousy.\n\nIt was only her knowledge of the laws and of the world that enabled her\nto control the swift instinct with which country folk, like wild men,\nreduce impulse to action. In this alone, perhaps, lies the difference\nbetween natural and civilized man. The savage has only impulse; the\ncivilized man has impulses and ideas. And in the savage the brain\nretains, as we may say, but few impressions, it is wholly at the mercy\nof the feeling that rushes in upon it; while in the civilized man, ideas\nsink into the heart and change it; he has a thousand interests and many\nfeelings, where the savage has but one at a time. This is the cause of\nthe transient ascendency of a child over its parents, which ceases as\nsoon as it is satisfied; in the man who is still one with nature, this\ncontrast is constant. Cousin Betty, a savage of Lorraine, somewhat\ntreacherous too, was of this class of natures, which are commoner among\nthe lower orders than is supposed, accounting for the conduct of the\npopulace during revolutions.\n\n\n\nAt the time when this _Drama_ opens, if Cousin Betty would have allowed\nherself to be dressed like other people; if, like the women of Paris,\nshe had been accustomed to wear each fashion in its turn, she would have\nbeen presentable and acceptable, but she preserved the stiffness of a\nstick. Now a woman devoid of all the graces, in Paris simply does not\nexist. The fine but hard eyes, the severe features, the Calabrian fixity\nof complexion which made Lisbeth like a figure by Giotto, and of which a\ntrue Parisian would have taken advantage, above all, her strange way of\ndressing, gave her such an extraordinary appearance that she sometimes\nlooked like one of those monkeys in petticoats taken about by little\nSavoyards. As she was well known in the houses connected by family which\nshe frequented, and restricted her social efforts to that little circle,\nas she liked her own home, her singularities no longer astonished\nanybody; and out of doors they were lost in the immense stir of Paris\nstreet-life, where only pretty women are ever looked at.\n\nHortense's laughter was at this moment caused by a victory won over her\nCousin Lisbeth's perversity; she had just wrung from her an avowal she\nhad been hoping for these three years past. However secretive an old\nmaid may be, there is one sentiment which will always avail to make her\nbreak her fast from words, and that is her vanity. For the last three\nyears, Hortense, having become very inquisitive on such matters, had\npestered her cousin with questions, which, however, bore the stamp of\nperfect innocence. She wanted to know why her cousin had never married.\nHortense, who knew of the five offers that she had refused, had\nconstructed her little romance; she supposed that Lisbeth had had a\npassionate attachment, and a war of banter was the result. Hortense\nwould talk of \"We young girls!\" when speaking of herself and her cousin.\n\nCousin Betty had on several occasions answered in the same tone--\"And\nwho says I have not a lover?\" So Cousin Betty's lover, real or\nfictitious, became a subject of mild jesting. At last, after two years\nof this petty warfare, the last time Lisbeth had come to the house\nHortense's first question had been:\n\n\"And how is your lover?\"\n\n\"Pretty well, thank you,\" was the answer. \"He is rather ailing, poor\nyoung man.\"\n\n\"He has delicate health?\" asked the Baroness, laughing.\n\n\"I should think so! He is fair. A sooty thing like me can love none but\na fair man with a color like the moon.\"\n\n\"But who is he? What does he do?\" asked Hortense. \"Is he a prince?\"\n\n\"A prince of artisans, as I am queen of the bobbin. Is a poor woman like\nme likely to find a lover in a man with a fine house and money in the\nfunds, or in a duke of the realm, or some Prince Charming out of a fairy\ntale?\"\n\n\"Oh, I should so much like to see him!\" cried Hortense, smiling.\n\n\"To see what a man can be like who can love the Nanny Goat?\" retorted\nLisbeth.\n\n\"He must be some monster of an old clerk, with a goat's beard!\" Hortense\nsaid to her mother.\n\n\"Well, then, you are quite mistaken, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Then you mean that you really have a lover?\" Hortense exclaimed in\ntriumph.\n\n\"As sure as you have not!\" retorted Lisbeth, nettled.\n\n\"But if you have a lover, why don't you marry him, Lisbeth?\" said the\nBaroness, shaking her head at her daughter. \"We have been hearing rumors\nabout him these three years. You have had time to study him; and if he\nhas been faithful so long, you should not persist in a delay which must\nbe hard upon him. After all, it is a matter of conscience; and if he is\nyoung, it is time to take a brevet of dignity.\"\n\nCousin Betty had fixed her gaze on Adeline, and seeing that she was\njesting, she replied:\n\n\"It would be marrying hunger and thirst; he is a workman, I am a\nworkwoman. If we had children, they would be workmen.--No, no; we love\neach other spiritually; it is less expensive.\"\n\n\"Why do you keep him in hiding?\" Hortense asked.\n\n\"He wears a round jacket,\" replied the old maid, laughing.\n\n\"You truly love him?\" the Baroness inquired.\n\n\"I believe you! I love him for his own sake, the dear cherub. For four\nyears his home has been in my heart.\"\n\n\"Well, then, if you love him for himself,\" said the Baroness gravely,\n\"and if he really exists, you are treating him criminally. You do not\nknow how to love truly.\"\n\n\"We all know that from our birth,\" said Lisbeth.\n\n\"No, there are women who love and yet are selfish, and that is your\ncase.\"\n\nCousin Betty's head fell, and her glance would have made any one shiver\nwho had seen it; but her eyes were on her reel of thread.\n\n\"If you would introduce your so-called lover to us, Hector might find\nhim employment, or put him in a position to make money.\"\n\n\"That is out of the question,\" said Cousin Betty.\n\n\"And why?\"\n\n\"He is a sort of Pole--a refugee----\"\n\n\"A conspirator?\" cried Hortense. \"What luck for you!--Has he had any\nadventures?\"\n\n\"He has fought for Poland. He was a professor in the school where the\nstudents began the rebellion; and as he had been placed there by the\nGrand Duke Constantine, he has no hope of mercy----\"\n\n\"A professor of what?\"\n\n\"Of fine arts.\"\n\n\"And he came to Paris when the rebellion was quelled?\"\n\n\"In 1833. He came through Germany on foot.\"\n\n\"Poor young man! And how old is he?\"\n\n\"He was just four-and-twenty when the insurrection broke out--he is\ntwenty-nine now.\"\n\n\"Fifteen years your junior,\" said the Baroness.\n\n\"And what does he live on?\" asked Hortense.\n\n\"His talent.\"\n\n\"Oh, he gives lessons?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Cousin Betty; \"he gets them, and hard ones too!\"\n\n\"And his Christian name--is it a pretty name?\"\n\n\"Wenceslas.\"\n\n\"What a wonderful imagination you old maids have!\" exclaimed the\nBaroness. \"To hear you talk, Lisbeth, one might really believe you.\"\n\n\"You see, mamma, he is a Pole, and so accustomed to the knout that\nLisbeth reminds him of the joys of his native land.\"\n\nThey all three laughed, and Hortense sang _Wenceslas! idole de mon ame!_\ninstead of _O Mathilde_.\n\nThen for a few minutes there was a truce.\n\n\"These children,\" said Cousin Betty, looking at Hortense as she went up\nto her, \"fancy that no one but themselves can have lovers.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" Hortense replied, finding herself alone with her cousin, \"if\nyou prove to me that Wenceslas is not a pure invention, I will give you\nmy yellow cashmere shawl.\"\n\n\"He is a Count.\"\n\n\"Every Pole is a Count!\"\n\n\"But he is not a Pole; he comes from Liva--Litha----\"\n\n\"Lithuania?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Livonia?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's it!\"\n\n\"But what is his name?\"\n\n\"I wonder if you are capable of keeping a secret.\"\n\n\"Cousin Betty, I will be as mute!----\"\n\n\"As a fish?\"\n\n\"As a fish.\"\n\n\"By your life eternal?\"\n\n\"By my life eternal!\"\n\n\"No, by your happiness in this world?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, then, his name is Wenceslas Steinbock.\"\n\n\"One of Charles XII.'s Generals was named Steinbock.\"\n\n\"He was his grand-uncle. His own father settled in Livonia after the\ndeath of the King of Sweden; but he lost all his fortune during the\ncampaign of 1812, and died, leaving the poor boy at the age of eight\nwithout a penny. The Grand Duke Constantine, for the honor of the name\nof Steinbock, took him under his protection and sent him to school.\"\n\n\"I will not break my word,\" Hortense replied; \"prove his existence,\nand you shall have the yellow shawl. The color is most becoming to dark\nskins.\"\n\n\"And you will keep my secret?\"\n\n\"And tell you mine.\"\n\n\"Well, then, the next time I come you shall have the proof.\"\n\n\"But the proof will be the lover,\" said Hortense.\n\nCousin Betty, who, since her first arrival in Paris, had been bitten\nby a mania for shawls, was bewitched by the idea of owning the yellow\ncashmere given to his wife by the Baron in 1808, and handed down from\nmother to daughter after the manner of some families in 1830. The shawl\nhad been a good deal worn ten years ago; but the costly object, now\nalways kept in its sandal-wood box, seemed to the old maid ever new,\nlike the drawing-room furniture. So she brought in her handbag a present\nfor the Baroness' birthday, by which she proposed to prove the existence\nof her romantic lover.\n\nThis present was a silver seal formed of three little figures back to\nback, wreathed with foliage, and supporting the Globe. They represented\nFaith, Hope, and Charity; their feet rested on monsters rending each\nother, among them the symbolical serpent. In 1846, now that such immense\nstrides have been made in the art of which Benvenuto Cellini was the\nmaster, by Mademoiselle de Fauveau, Wagner, Jeanest, Froment-Meurice,\nand wood-carvers like Lienard, this little masterpiece would amaze\nnobody; but at that time a girl who understood the silversmith's art\nstood astonished as she held the seal which Lisbeth put into her hands,\nsaying:\n\n\"There! what do you think of that?\"\n\nIn design, attitude, and drapery the figures were of the school of\nRaphael; but the execution was in the style of the Florentine metal\nworkers--the school created by Donatello, Brunelleschi, Ghiberti,\nBenvenuto Cellini, John of Bologna, and others. The French masters of\nthe Renaissance had never invented more strangely twining monsters than\nthese that symbolized the evil passions. The palms, ferns, reeds, and\nfoliage that wreathed the Virtues showed a style, a taste, a handling\nthat might have driven a practised craftsman to despair; a scroll\nfloated above the three figures; and on its surface, between the heads,\nwere a W, a chamois, and the word _fecit_.\n\n\"Who carved this?\" asked Hortense.\n\n\"Well, just my lover,\" replied Lisbeth. \"There are ten months' work in\nit; I could earn more at making sword-knots.--He told me that Steinbock\nmeans a rock goat, a chamois, in German. And he intends to mark all his\nwork in that way.--Ah, ha! I shall have the shawl.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"Do you suppose I could buy such a thing, or order it? Impossible!\nWell, then, it must have been given to me. And who would make me such a\npresent? A lover!\"\n\nHortense, with an artfulness that would have frightened Lisbeth Fischer\nif she had detected it, took care not to express all her admiration,\nthough she was full of the delight which every soul that is open to a\nsense of beauty must feel on seeing a faultless piece of work--perfect\nand unexpected.\n\n\"On my word,\" said she, \"it is very pretty.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is pretty,\" said her cousin; \"but I like an orange-colored\nshawl better.--Well, child, my lover spends his time in doing such work\nas that. Since he came to Paris he has turned out three or four little\ntrifles in that style, and that is the fruit of four years' study\nand toil. He has served as apprentice to founders, metal-casters, and\ngoldsmiths.--There he has paid away thousands and hundreds of francs.\nAnd my gentleman tells me that in a few months now he will be famous and\nrich----\"\n\n\"Then you often see him?\"\n\n\"Bless me, do you think it is all a fable? I told you truth in jest.\"\n\n\"And he is in love with you?\" asked Hortense eagerly.\n\n\"He adores me,\" replied Lisbeth very seriously. \"You see, child, he had\nnever seen any women but the washed out, pale things they all are in\nthe north, and a slender, brown, youthful thing like me warmed his\nheart.--But, mum; you promised, you know!\"\n\n\"And he will fare like the five others,\" said the girl ironically, as\nshe looked at the seal.\n\n\"Six others, miss. I left one in Lorraine, who, to this day, would fetch\nthe moon down for me.\"\n\n\"This one does better than that,\" said Hortense; \"he has brought down\nthe sun.\"\n\n\"Where can that be turned into money?\" asked her cousin. \"It takes wide\nlands to benefit by the sunshine.\"\n\nThese witticisms, fired in quick retort, and leading to the sort of\ngiddy play that may be imagined, had given cause for the laughter which\nhad added to the Baroness' troubles by making her compare her\ndaughter's future lot with the present, when she was free to indulge the\nlight-heartedness of youth.\n\n\"But to give you a gem which cost him six months of work, he must be\nunder some great obligations to you?\" said Hortense, in whom the silver\nseal had suggested very serious reflections.\n\n\"Oh, you want to know too much at once!\" said her cousin. \"But, listen,\nI will let you into a little plot.\"\n\n\"Is your lover in it too?\"\n\n\"Oh, ho! you want so much to see him! But, as you may suppose, an old\nmaid like Cousin Betty, who had managed to keep a lover for five years,\nkeeps him well hidden.--Now, just let me alone. You see, I have neither\ncat nor canary, neither dog nor a parrot, and the old Nanny Goat wanted\nsomething to pet and tease--so I treated myself to a Polish Count.\"\n\n\"Has he a moustache?\"\n\n\"As long as that,\" said Lisbeth, holding up her shuttle filled with gold\nthread. She always took her lace-work with her, and worked till dinner\nwas served.\n\n\"If you ask too many questions, you will be told nothing,\" she went on.\n\"You are but two-and-twenty, and you chatter more than I do though I am\nforty-two--not to say forty-three.\"\n\n\"I am listening; I am a wooden image,\" said Hortense.\n\n\"My lover has finished a bronze group ten inches high,\" Lisbeth went on.\n\"It represents Samson slaying a lion, and he has kept it buried till it\nis so rusty that you might believe it to be as old as Samson himself.\nThis fine piece is shown at the shop of one of the old curiosity sellers\non the Place du Carrousel, near my lodgings. Now, your father knows\nMonsieur Popinot, the Minister of Commerce and Agriculture, and the\nComte de Rastignac, and if he would mention the group to them as a fine\nantique he had seen by chance! It seems that such things take the fancy\nof your grand folks, who don't care so much about gold lace, and that my\nman's fortune would be made if one of them would buy or even look at\nthe wretched piece of metal. The poor fellow is sure that it might be\nmistaken for old work, and that the rubbish is worth a great deal of\nmoney. And then, if one of the ministers should purchase the group, he\nwould go to pay his respects, and prove that he was the maker, and be\nalmost carried in triumph! Oh! he believes he has reached the pinnacle;\npoor young man, and he is as proud as two newly-made Counts.\"\n\n\"Michael Angelo over again; but, for a lover, he has kept his head on\nhis shoulders!\" said Hortense. \"And how much does he want for it?\"\n\n\"Fifteen hundred francs. The dealer will not let it go for less, since\nhe must take his commission.\"\n\n\"Papa is in the King's household just now,\" said Hortense. \"He sees\nthose two ministers every day at the Chamber, and he will do the\nthing--I undertake that. You will be a rich woman, Madame la Comtesse de\nSteinbock.\"\n\n\"No, the boy is too lazy; for whole weeks he sits twiddling with bits\nof red wax, and nothing comes of it. Why, he spends all his days at the\nLouvre and the Library, looking at prints and sketching things. He is an\nidler!\"\n\nThe cousins chatted and giggled; Hortense laughing a forced laugh, for\nshe was invaded by a kind of love which every girl has gone through--the\nlove of the unknown, love in its vaguest form, when every thought is\naccreted round some form which is suggested by a chance word, as the\nefflorescence of hoar-frost gathers about a straw that the wind has\nblown against the window-sill.\n\nFor the past ten months she had made a reality of her cousin's imaginary\nromance, believing, like her mother, that Lisbeth would never marry;\nand now, within a week, this visionary being had become Comte Wenceslas\nSteinbock, the dream had a certificate of birth, the wraith had\nsolidified into a young man of thirty. The seal she held in her hand--a\nsort of Annunciation in which genius shone like an immanent light--had\nthe powers of a talisman. Hortense felt such a surge of happiness, that\nshe almost doubted whether the tale were true; there was a ferment in\nher blood, and she laughed wildly to deceive her cousin.\n\n\"But I think the drawing-room door is open,\" said Lisbeth; \"let us go\nand see if Monsieur Crevel is gone.\"\n\n\"Mamma has been very much out of spirits these two days. I suppose the\nmarriage under discussion has come to nothing!\"\n\n\"Oh, it may come on again. He is--I may tell you so much--a Councillor\nof the Supreme Court. How would you like to be Madame la Presidente? If\nMonsieur Crevel has a finger in it, he will tell me about it if I ask\nhim. I shall know by to-morrow if there is any hope.\"\n\n\"Leave the seal with me,\" said Hortense; \"I will not show it--mamma's\nbirthday is not for a month yet; I will give it to you that morning.\"\n\n\"No, no. Give it back to me; it must have a case.\"\n\n\"But I will let papa see it, that he may know what he is talking about\nto the ministers, for men in authority must be careful what they say,\"\nurged the girl.\n\n\"Well, do not show it to your mother--that is all I ask; for if she\nbelieved I had a lover, she would make game of me.\"\n\n\"I promise.\"\n\nThe cousins reached the drawing-room just as the Baroness turned faint.\nHer daughter's cry of alarm recalled her to herself. Lisbeth went off to\nfetch some salts. When she came back, she found the mother and daughter\nin each other's arms, the Baroness soothing her daughter's fears, and\nsaying:\n\n\"It was nothing; a little nervous attack.--There is your father,\" she\nadded, recognizing the Baron's way of ringing the bell. \"Say not a word\nto him.\"\n\nAdeline rose and went to meet her husband, intending to take him\ninto the garden and talk to him till dinner should be served of the\ndifficulties about the proposed match, getting him to come to some\ndecision as to the future, and trying to hint at some warning advice.\n\n\n\nBaron Hector Hulot came in, in a dress at once lawyer-like and\nNapoleonic, for Imperial men--men who had been attached to the\nEmperor--were easily distinguishable by their military deportment, their\nblue coats with gilt buttons, buttoned to the chin, their black silk\nstock, and an authoritative demeanor acquired from a habit of command in\ncircumstances requiring despotic rapidity. There was nothing of the old\nman in the Baron, it must be admitted; his sight was still so good,\nthat he could read without spectacles; his handsome oval face, framed\nin whiskers that were indeed too black, showed a brilliant complexion,\nruddy with the veins that characterize a sanguine temperament; and his\nstomach, kept in order by a belt, had not exceeded the limits of \"the\nmajestic,\" as Brillat-Savarin says. A fine aristocratic air and great\naffability served to conceal the libertine with whom Crevel had had such\nhigh times. He was one of those men whose eyes always light up at the\nsight of a pretty woman, even of such as merely pass by, never to be\nseen again.\n\n\"Have you been speaking, my dear?\" asked Adeline, seeing him with an\nanxious brow.\n\n\"No,\" replied Hector, \"but I am worn out with hearing others speak for\ntwo hours without coming to a vote. They carry on a war of words, in\nwhich their speeches are like a cavalry charge which has no effect on\nthe enemy. Talk has taken the place of action, which goes very much\nagainst the grain with men who are accustomed to marching orders, as\nI said to the Marshal when I left him. However, I have enough of\nbeing bored on the ministers' bench; here I may play.--How do, la\nChevre!--Good morning, little kid,\" and he took his daughter round the\nneck, kissed her, and made her sit on his knee, resting her head on his\nshoulder, that he might feel her soft golden hair against his cheek.\n\n\"He is tired and worried,\" said his wife to herself. \"I shall only worry\nhim more.--I will wait.--Are you going to be at home this evening?\" she\nasked him.\n\n\"No, children. After dinner I must go out. If it had not been the day\nwhen Lisbeth and the children and my brother come to dinner, you would\nnot have seen me at all.\"\n\nThe Baroness took up the newspaper, looked down the list of theatres,\nand laid it down again when she had seen that Robert _le Diable_ was\nto be given at the Opera. Josepha, who had left the Italian Opera six\nmonths since for the French Opera, was to take the part of Alice.\n\nThis little pantomime did not escape the Baron, who looked hard at\nhis wife. Adeline cast down her eyes and went out into the garden; her\nhusband followed her.\n\n\"Come, what is it, Adeline?\" said he, putting his arm round her waist\nand pressing her to his side. \"Do not you know that I love you more\nthan----\"\n\n\"More than Jenny Cadine or Josepha!\" said she, boldly interrupting him.\n\n\"Who put that into your head?\" exclaimed the Baron, releasing his wife,\nand starting back a step or two.\n\n\"I got an anonymous letter, which I burnt at once, in which I was told,\nmy dear, that the reason Hortense's marriage was broken off was the\npoverty of our circumstances. Your wife, my dear Hector, would never\nhave said a word; she knew of your connection with Jenny Cadine, and did\nshe ever complain?--But as the mother of Hortense, I am bound to speak\nthe truth.\"\n\nHulot, after a short silence, which was terrible to his wife, whose\nheart beat loud enough to be heard, opened his arms, clasped her to his\nheart, kissed her forehead, and said with the vehemence of enthusiasm:\n\n\"Adeline, you are an angel, and I am a wretch----\"\n\n\"No, no,\" cried the Baroness, hastily laying her hand upon his lips to\nhinder him from speaking evil of himself.\n\n\"Yes, for I have not at this moment a sou to give to Hortense, and I am\nmost unhappy. But since you open your heart to me, I may pour into it\nthe trouble that is crushing me.--Your Uncle Fischer is in difficulties,\nand it is I who dragged him there, for he has accepted bills for me\nto the amount of twenty-five thousand francs! And all for a woman who\ndeceives me, who laughs at me behind my back, and calls me an old\ndyed Tom. It is frightful! A vice which costs me more than it would to\nmaintain a family!--And I cannot resist!--I would promise you here and\nnow never to see that abominable Jewess again; but if she wrote me two\nlines, I should go to her, as we marched into fire under the Emperor.\"\n\n\"Do not be so distressed,\" cried the poor woman in despair, but\nforgetting her daughter as she saw the tears in her husband's eyes.\n\"There are my diamonds; whatever happens, save my uncle.\"\n\n\"Your diamonds are worth scarcely twenty thousand francs nowadays. That\nwould not be enough for old Fischer, so keep them for Hortense; I will\nsee the Marshal to-morrow.\"\n\n\"My poor dear!\" said the Baroness, taking her Hector's hands and kissing\nthem.\n\nThis was all the scolding he got. Adeline sacrificed her jewels, the\nfather made them a present to Hortense, she regarded this as a sublime\naction, and she was helpless.\n\n\"He is the master; he could take everything, and he leaves me my\ndiamonds; he is divine!\"\n\nThis was the current of her thoughts; and indeed the wife had gained\nmore by her sweetness than another perhaps could have achieved by a fit\nof angry jealousy.\n\nThe moralist cannot deny that, as a rule, well-bred though very wicked\nmen are far more attractive and lovable than virtuous men; having crimes\nto atone for, they crave indulgence by anticipation, by being lenient\nto the shortcomings of those who judge them, and they are thought most\nkind. Though there are no doubt some charming people among the virtuous,\nVirtue considers itself fair enough, unadorned, to be at no pains to\nplease; and then all really virtuous persons, for the hypocrites do not\ncount, have some slight doubts as to their position; they believe that\nthey are cheated in the bargain of life on the whole, and they indulge\nin acid comments after the fashion of those who think themselves\nunappreciated.\n\nHence the Baron, who accused himself of ruining his family, displayed\nall his charm of wit and his most seductive graces for the benefit of\nhis wife, for his children, and his Cousin Lisbeth.\n\nThen, when his son arrived with Celestine, Crevel's daughter, who was\nnursing the infant Hulot, he was delightful to his daughter-in-law,\nloading her with compliments--a treat to which Celestine's vanity was\nlittle accustomed for no moneyed bride more commonplace or more utterly\ninsignificant was ever seen. The grandfather took the baby from her,\nkissed it, declared it was a beauty and a darling; he spoke to it in\nbaby language, prophesied that it would grow to be taller than himself,\ninsinuated compliments for his son's benefit, and restored the child to\nthe Normandy nurse who had charge of it. Celestine, on her part, gave\nthe Baroness a look, as much as to say, \"What a delightful man!\" and she\nnaturally took her father-in-law's part against her father.\n\nAfter thus playing the charming father-in-law and the indulgent\ngrandpapa, the Baron took his son into the garden, and laid before him\na variety of observations full of good sense as to the attitude to be\ntaken up by the Chamber on a certain ticklish question which had\nthat morning come under discussion. The young lawyer was struck with\nadmiration for the depth of his father's insight, touched by his\ncordiality, and especially by the deferential tone which seemed to place\nthe two men on a footing of equality.\n\nMonsieur Hulot _junior_ was in every respect the young Frenchman, as\nhe has been moulded by the Revolution of 1830; his mind infatuated with\npolitics, respectful of his own hopes, and concealing them under\nan affectation of gravity, very envious of successful men, making\nsententiousness do the duty of witty rejoinders--the gems of the French\nlanguage--with a high sense of importance, and mistaking arrogance for\ndignity.\n\nSuch men are walking coffins, each containing a Frenchman of the past;\nnow and again the Frenchman wakes up and kicks against his English-made\ncasing; but ambition stifles him, and he submits to be smothered. The\ncoffin is always covered with black cloth.\n\n\"Ah, here is my brother!\" said Baron Hulot, going to meet the Count at\nthe drawing-room door.\n\nHaving greeted the probable successor of the late Marshal Montcornet, he\nled him forward by the arm with every show of affection and respect.\n\nThe older man, a member of the Chamber of Peers, but excused from\nattendance on account of his deafness, had a handsome head, chilled by\nage, but with enough gray hair still to be marked in a circle by the\npressure of his hat. He was short, square, and shrunken, but carried his\nhale old age with a free-and-easy air; and as he was full of excessive\nactivity, which had now no purpose, he divided his time between reading\nand taking exercise. In a drawing-room he devoted his attention to\nwaiting on the wishes of the ladies.\n\n\"You are very merry here,\" said he, seeing that the Baron shed a spirit\nof animation on the little family gathering. \"And yet Hortense is\nnot married,\" he added, noticing a trace of melancholy on his\nsister-in-law's countenance.\n\n\"That will come all in good time,\" Lisbeth shouted in his ear in a\nformidable voice.\n\n\"So there you are, you wretched seedling that could never blossom,\" said\nhe, laughing.\n\nThe hero of Forzheim rather liked Cousin Betty, for there were certain\npoints of resemblance between them. A man of the ranks, without any\neducation, his courage had been the sole mainspring of his military\npromotion, and sound sense had taken the place of brilliancy. Of the\nhighest honor and clean-handed, he was ending a noble life in full\ncontentment in the centre of his family, which claimed all his\naffections, and without a suspicion of his brother's still undiscovered\nmisconduct. No one enjoyed more than he the pleasing sight of this\nfamily party, where there never was the smallest disagreement, for the\nbrothers and sisters were all equally attached, Celestine having been at\nonce accepted as one of the family. But the worthy little Count wondered\nnow and then why Monsieur Crevel never joined the party. \"Papa is in\nthe country,\" Celestine shouted, and it was explained to him that the\nex-perfumer was away from home.\n\nThis perfect union of all her family made Madame Hulot say to herself,\n\"This, after all, is the best kind of happiness, and who can deprive us\nof it?\"\n\nThe General, on seeing his favorite Adeline the object of her husband's\nattentions, laughed so much about it that the Baron, fearing to seem\nridiculous, transferred his gallantries to his daughter-in-law, who\nat these family dinners was always the object of his flattery and kind\ncare, for he hoped to win Crevel back through her, and make him forego\nhis resentment.\n\nAny one seeing this domestic scene would have found it hard to believe\nthat the father was at his wits' end, the mother in despair, the son\nanxious beyond words as to his father's future fate, and the daughter on\nthe point of robbing her cousin of her lover.\n\n\n\nAt seven o'clock the Baron, seeing his brother, his son, the Baroness,\nand Hortense all engaged at whist, went off to applaud his mistress\nat the Opera, taking with him Lisbeth Fischer, who lived in the Rue du\nDoyenne, and who always made an excuse of the solitude of that deserted\nquarter to take herself off as soon as dinner was over. Parisians will\nall admit that the old maid's prudence was but rational.\n\nThe existence of the maze of houses under the wing of the old Louvre is\none of those protests against obvious good sense which Frenchmen love,\nthat Europe may reassure itself as to the quantum of brains they are\nknown to have, and not be too much alarmed. Perhaps without knowing it,\nthis reveals some profound political idea.\n\nIt will surely not be a work of supererogation to describe this part of\nParis as it is even now, when we could hardly expect its survival; and\nour grandsons, who will no doubt see the Louvre finished, may refuse\nto believe that such a relic of barbarism should have survived for\nsix-and-thirty years in the heart of Paris and in the face of the palace\nwhere three dynasties of kings have received, during those thirty-six\nyears, the elite of France and of Europe.\n\nBetween the little gate leading to the Bridge of the Carrousel and the\nRue du Musee, every one having come to Paris, were it but for a few\ndays, must have seen a dozen of houses with a decayed frontage where the\ndejected owners have attempted no repairs, the remains of an old\nblock of buildings of which the destruction was begun at the time when\nNapoleon determined to complete the Louvre. This street, and the blind\nalley known as the Impasse du Doyenne, are the only passages into this\ngloomy and forsaken block, inhabited perhaps by ghosts, for there never\nis anybody to be seen. The pavement is much below the footway of the\nRue du Musee, on a level with that of the Rue Froidmanteau. Thus, half\nsunken by the raising of the soil, these houses are also wrapped in the\nperpetual shadow cast by the lofty buildings of the Louvre, darkened on\nthat side by the northern blast. Darkness, silence, an icy chill, and\nthe cavernous depth of the soil combine to make these houses a kind\nof crypt, tombs of the living. As we drive in a hackney cab past this\ndead-alive spot, and chance to look down the little Rue du Doyenne,\na shudder freezes the soul, and we wonder who can lie there, and what\nthings may be done there at night, at an hour when the alley is a\ncut-throat pit, and the vices of Paris run riot there under the cloak\nof night. This question, frightful in itself, becomes appalling when we\nnote that these dwelling-houses are shut in on the side towards the Rue\nde Richelieu by marshy ground, by a sea of tumbled paving-stones between\nthem and the Tuileries, by little garden-plots and suspicious-looking\nhovels on the side of the great galleries, and by a desert of\nbuilding-stone and old rubbish on the side towards the old Louvre. Henri\nIII. and his favorites in search of their trunk-hose, and Marguerite's\nlovers in search of their heads, must dance sarabands by moonlight in\nthis wilderness overlooked by the roof of a chapel still standing\nthere as if to prove that the Catholic religion--so deeply rooted in\nFrance--survives all else.\n\nFor forty years now has the Louvre been crying out by every gap in these\ndamaged walls, by every yawning window, \"Rid me of these warts upon my\nface!\" This cutthroat lane has no doubt been regarded as useful, and has\nbeen thought necessary as symbolizing in the heart of Paris the intimate\nconnection between poverty and the splendor that is characteristic\nof the queen of cities. And indeed these chill ruins, among which\nthe Legitimist newspaper contracted the disease it is dying of--the\nabominable hovels of the Rue du Musee, and the hoarding appropriated by\nthe shop stalls that flourish there--will perhaps live longer and more\nprosperously than three successive dynasties.\n\nIn 1823 the low rents in these already condemned houses had tempted\nLisbeth Fischer to settle there, notwithstanding the necessity imposed\nupon her by the state of the neighborhood to get home before nightfall.\nThis necessity, however, was in accordance with the country habits she\nretained, of rising and going to bed with the sun, an arrangement which\nsaves country folk considerable sums in lights and fuel. She lived\nin one of the houses which, since the demolition of the famous Hotel\nCambaceres, command a view of the square.\n\nJust as Baron Hulot set his wife's cousin down at the door of this\nhouse, saying, \"Good-night, Cousin,\" an elegant-looking woman, young,\nsmall, slender, pretty, beautifully dressed, and redolent of some\ndelicate perfume, passed between the wall and the carriage to go in.\nThis lady, without any premeditation, glanced up at the Baron merely\nto see the lodger's cousin, and the libertine at once felt the\nswift impression which all Parisians know on meeting a pretty woman,\nrealizing, as entomologists have it, their _desiderata_; so he waited to\nput on one of his gloves with judicious deliberation before getting into\nthe carriage again, to give himself an excuse for allowing his eye\nto follow the young woman, whose skirts were pleasingly set out by\nsomething else than these odious and delusive crinoline bustles.\n\n\"That,\" said he to himself, \"is a nice little person whose happiness I\nshould like to provide for, as she would certainly secure mine.\"\n\nWhen the unknown fair had gone into the hall at the foot of the stairs\ngoing up to the front rooms, she glanced at the gate out of the corner\nof her eye without precisely looking round, and she could see the Baron\nriveted to the spot in admiration, consumed by curiosity and desire.\nThis is to every Parisian woman a sort of flower which she smells at\nwith delight, if she meets it on her way. Nay, certain women, though\nfaithful to their duties, pretty, and virtuous, come home much put out\nif they have failed to cull such a posy in the course of their walk.\n\nThe lady ran upstairs, and in a moment a window on the second floor\nwas thrown open, and she appeared at it, but accompanied by a man whose\nbaldhead and somewhat scowling looks announced him as her husband.\n\n\"If they aren't sharp and ingenious, the cunning jades!\" thought the\nBaron. \"She does that to show me where she lives. But this is getting\nrather warm, especially for this part of Paris. We must mind what we are\nat.\"\n\nAs he got into the _milord_, he looked up, and the lady and the husband\nhastily vanished, as though the Baron's face had affected them like the\nmythological head of Medusa.\n\n\"It would seem that they know me,\" thought the Baron. \"That would\naccount for everything.\"\n\nAs the carriage went up the Rue du Musee, he leaned forward to see the\nlady again, and in fact she was again at the window. Ashamed of being\ncaught gazing at the hood under which her admirer was sitting, the\nunknown started back at once.\n\n\"Nanny shall tell me who it is,\" said the Baron to himself.\n\nThe sight of the Government official had, as will be seen, made a deep\nimpression on this couple.\n\n\"Why, it is Baron Hulot, the chief of the department to which my office\nbelongs!\" exclaimed the husband as he left the window.\n\n\"Well, Marneffe, the old maid on the third floor at the back of the\ncourtyard, who lives with that young man, is his cousin. Is it not odd\nthat we should never have known that till to-day, and now find it out by\nchance?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle Fischer living with a young man?\" repeated the husband.\n\"That is porter's gossip; do not speak so lightly of the cousin of\na Councillor of State who can blow hot and cold in the office as he\npleases. Now, come to dinner; I have been waiting for you since four\no'clock.\"\n\nPretty--very pretty--Madame Marneffe, the natural daughter of Comte\nMontcornet, one of Napoleon's most famous officers, had, on the strength\nof a marriage portion of twenty thousand francs, found a husband in an\ninferior official at the War Office. Through the interest of the\nfamous lieutenant-general--made marshal of France six months before his\ndeath--this quill-driver had risen to unhoped-for dignity as head-clerk\nof his office; but just as he was to be promoted to be deputy-chief, the\nmarshal's death had cut off Marneffe's ambitions and his wife's at the\nroot. The very small salary enjoyed by Sieur Marneffe had compelled the\ncouple to economize in the matter of rent; for in his hands Mademoiselle\nValerie Fortin's fortune had already melted away--partly in paying his\ndebts, and partly in the purchase of necessaries for furnishing a house,\nbut chiefly in gratifying the requirements of a pretty young wife,\naccustomed in her mother's house to luxuries she did not choose to\ndispense with. The situation of the Rue du Doyenne, within easy distance\nof the War Office, and the gay part of Paris, smiled on Monsieur and\nMadame Marneffe, and for the last four years they had dwelt under the\nsame roof as Lisbeth Fischer.\n\nMonsieur Jean-Paul-Stanislas Marneffe was one of the class of employes\nwho escape sheer brutishness by the kind of power that comes of\ndepravity. The small, lean creature, with thin hair and a starved beard,\nan unwholesome pasty face, worn rather than wrinkled, with red-lidded\neyes harnessed with spectacles, shuffling in his gait, and yet meaner in\nhis appearance, realized the type of man that any one would conceive of\nas likely to be placed in the dock for an offence against decency.\n\nThe rooms inhabited by this couple had the illusory appearance of sham\nluxury seen in many Paris homes, and typical of a certain class of\nhousehold. In the drawing-room, the furniture covered with shabby cotton\nvelvet, the plaster statuettes pretending to be Florentine bronze, the\nclumsy cast chandelier merely lacquered, with cheap glass saucers, the\ncarpet, whose small cost was accounted for in advancing life by the\nquality of cotton used in the manufacture, now visible to the naked\neye,--everything, down to the curtains, which plainly showed that\nworsted damask has not three years of prime, proclaimed poverty as\nloudly as a beggar in rags at a church door.\n\nThe dining-room, badly kept by a single servant, had the sickening\naspect of a country inn; everything looked greasy and unclean.\n\nMonsieur's room, very like a schoolboy's, furnished with the bed and\nfittings remaining from his bachelor days, as shabby and worn as he was,\ndusted perhaps once a week--that horrible room where everything was in\na litter, with old socks hanging over the horsehair-seated chairs, the\npattern outlined in dust, was that of a man to whom home is a matter of\nindifference, who lives out of doors, gambling in cafes or elsewhere.\n\nMadame's room was an exception to the squalid slovenliness that\ndisgraced the living rooms, where the curtains were yellow with smoke\nand dust, and where the child, evidently left to himself, littered every\nspot with his toys. Valerie's room and dressing-room were situated in\nthe part of the house which, on one side of the courtyard, joined the\nfront half, looking out on the street, to the wing forming the inner\nside of the court backing against the adjoining property. Handsomely\nhung with chintz, furnished with rosewood, and thickly carpeted,\nthey proclaimed themselves as belonging to a pretty woman--and indeed\nsuggested the kept mistress. A clock in the fashionable style stood on\nthe velvet-covered mantelpiece. There was a nicely fitted cabinet,\nand the Chinese flower-stands were handsomely filled. The bed, the\ntoilet-table, the wardrobe with its mirror, the little sofa, and all the\nlady's frippery bore the stamp of fashion or caprice. Though everything\nwas quite third-rate as to elegance or quality, and nothing was\nabsolutely newer than three years old, a dandy would have had no fault\nto find but that the taste of all this luxury was commonplace. Art,\nand the distinction that comes of the choice of things that taste\nassimilates, was entirely wanting. A doctor of social science would have\ndetected a lover in two or three specimens of costly trumpery, which\ncould only have come there through that demi-god--always absent, but\nalways present if the lady is married.\n\nThe dinner, four hours behind time, to which the husband, wife, and\nchild sat down, betrayed the financial straits in which the household\nfound itself, for the table is the surest thermometer for gauging the\nincome of a Parisian family. Vegetable soup made with the water haricot\nbeans had been boiled in, a piece of stewed veal and potatoes sodden\nwith water by way of gravy, a dish of haricot beans, and cheap cherries,\nserved and eaten in cracked plates and dishes, with the dull-looking and\ndull-sounding forks of German silver--was this a banquet worthy of this\npretty young woman? The Baron would have wept could he have seen it. The\ndingy decanters could not disguise the vile hue of wine bought by the\npint at the nearest wineshop. The table-napkins had seen a week's\nuse. In short, everything betrayed undignified penury, and the equal\nindifference of the husband and wife to the decencies of home. The\nmost superficial observer on seeing them would have said that these two\nbeings had come to the stage when the necessity of living had prepared\nthem for any kind of dishonor that might bring luck to them. Valerie's\nfirst words to her husband will explain the delay that had postponed the\ndinner by the not disinterested devotion of the cook.\n\n\"Samanon will only take your bills at fifty per cent, and insists on a\nlien on your salary as security.\"\n\nSo poverty, still unconfessed in the house of the superior official, and\nhidden under a stipend of twenty-four thousand francs, irrespective of\npresents, had reached its lowest stage in that of the clerk.\n\n\"You have caught on with the chief,\" said the man, looking at his wife.\n\n\"I rather think so,\" replied she, understanding the full meaning of his\nslang expression.\n\n\"What is to become of us?\" Marneffe went on. \"The landlord will be down\non us to-morrow. And to think of your father dying without making a\nwill! On my honor, those men of the Empire all think themselves as\nimmortal as their Emperor.\"\n\n\"Poor father!\" said she. \"I was his only child, and he was very fond of\nme. The Countess probably burned the will. How could he forget me when\nhe used to give us as much as three or four thousand-franc notes at\nonce, from time to time?\"\n\n\"We owe four quarters' rent, fifteen hundred francs. Is the furniture\nworth so much? _That is the question_, as Shakespeare says.\"\n\n\"Now, good-bye, ducky!\" said Valerie, who had only eaten a few mouthfuls\nof the veal, from which the maid had extracted all the gravy for a brave\nsoldier just home from Algiers. \"Great evils demand heroic remedies.\"\n\n\"Valerie, where are you off to?\" cried Marneffe, standing between his\nwife and the door.\n\n\"I am going to see the landlord,\" she replied, arranging her ringlets\nunder her smart bonnet. \"You had better try to make friends with that\nold maid, if she really is your chief's cousin.\"\n\n\n\nThe ignorance in which the dwellers under one roof can exist as to the\nsocial position of their fellow-lodgers is a permanent fact which, as\nmuch as any other, shows what the rush of Paris life is. Still, it is\neasily conceivable that a clerk who goes early every morning to his\noffice, comes home only to dinner, and spends every evening out, and a\nwoman swallowed up in a round of pleasures, should know nothing of an\nold maid living on the third floor beyond the courtyard of the house\nthey dwell in, especially when she lives as Mademoiselle Fischer did.\n\nUp in the morning before any one else, Lisbeth went out to buy her\nbread, milk, and live charcoal, never speaking to any one, and she went\nto bed with the sun; she never had a letter or a visitor, nor chatted\nwith her neighbors. Here was one of those anonymous, entomological\nexistences such as are to be met with in many large tenements where,\nat the end of four years, you unexpectedly learn that up on the fourth\nfloor there is an old man lodging who knew Voltaire, Pilatre de Rozier,\nBeaujon, Marcel, Mole, Sophie Arnould, Franklin, and Robespierre. What\nMonsieur and Madame Marneffe had just said concerning Lisbeth Fischer\nthey had come to know, in consequence, partly, of the loneliness of the\nneighborhood, and of the alliance, to which their necessities had led,\nbetween them and the doorkeepers, whose goodwill was too important to\nthem not to have been carefully encouraged.\n\nNow, the old maid's pride, silence, and reserve had engendered in the\nporter and his wife the exaggerated respect and cold civility which\nbetray the unconfessed annoyance of an inferior. Also, the porter\nthought himself in all essentials the equal of any lodger whose rent was\nno more than two hundred and fifty francs. Cousin Betty's confidences\nto Hortense were true; and it is evident that the porter's wife might be\nvery likely to slander Mademoiselle Fischer in her intimate gossip with\nthe Marneffes, while only intending to tell tales.\n\nWhen Lisbeth had taken her candle from the hands of worthy Madame\nOlivier the portress, she looked up to see whether the windows of the\ngarret over her own rooms were lighted up. At that hour, even in July,\nit was so dark within the courtyard that the old maid could not get to\nbed without a light.\n\n\"Oh, you may be quite easy, Monsieur Steinbock is in his room. He has\nnot been out even,\" said Madame Olivier, with meaning.\n\nLisbeth made no reply. She was still a peasant, in so far that she was\nindifferent to the gossip of persons unconnected with her. Just as a\npeasant sees nothing beyond his village, she cared for nobody's opinion\noutside the little circle in which she lived. So she boldly went up, not\nto her own room, but to the garret; and this is why. At dessert she had\nfilled her bag with fruit and sweets for her lover, and she went to give\nthem to him, exactly as an old lady brings home a biscuit for her dog.\n\nShe found the hero of Hortense's dreams working by the light of a small\nlamp, of which the light was intensified by the use of a bottle of water\nas a lens--a pale young man, seated at a workman's bench covered with a\nmodeler's tools, wax, chisels, rough-hewn stone, and bronze castings; he\nwore a blouse, and had in his hand a little group in red wax, which he\ngazed at like a poet absorbed in his labors.\n\n\"Here, Wenceslas, see what I have brought you,\" said she, laying her\nhandkerchief on a corner of the table; then she carefully took the\nsweetmeats and fruit out of her bag.\n\n\"You are very kind, mademoiselle,\" replied the exile in melancholy\ntones.\n\n\"It will do you good, poor boy. You get feverish by working so hard; you\nwere not born to such a rough life.\"\n\nWenceslas Steinbock looked at her with a bewildered air.\n\n\"Eat--come, eat,\" said she sharply, \"instead of looking at me as you do\nat one of your images when you are satisfied with it.\"\n\nOn being thus smacked with words, the young man seemed less puzzled,\nfor this, indeed, was the female Mentor whose tender moods were always a\nsurprise to him, so much more accustomed was he to be scolded.\n\nThough Steinbock was nine-and-twenty, like many fair men, he looked five\nor six years younger; and seeing his youth, though its freshness had\nfaded under the fatigue and stress of life in exile, by the side of\nthat dry, hard face, it seemed as though Nature had blundered in the\ndistribution of sex. He rose and threw himself into a deep chair of\nLouis XV. pattern, covered with yellow Utrecht velvet, as if to rest\nhimself. The old maid took a greengage and offered it to him.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said he, taking the plum.\n\n\"Are you tired?\" said she, giving him another.\n\n\"I am not tired with work, but tired of life,\" said he.\n\n\"What absurd notions you have!\" she exclaimed with some annoyance. \"Have\nyou not had a good genius to keep an eye on you?\" she said, offering him\nthe sweetmeats, and watching him with pleasure as he ate them all. \"You\nsee, I thought of you when dining with my cousin.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said he, with a look at Lisbeth that was at once affectionate\nand plaintive, \"but for you I should long since have ceased to live.\nBut, my dear lady, artists require relaxation----\"\n\n\"Ah! there we come to the point!\" cried she, interrupting him, her hands\non her hips, and her flashing eyes fixed on him. \"You want to go wasting\nyour health in the vile resorts of Paris, like so many artisans, who end\nby dying in the workhouse. No, no, make a fortune, and then, when you\nhave money in the funds, you may amuse yourself, child; then you will\nhave enough to pay for the doctor and for your pleasure, libertine that\nyou are.\"\n\nWenceslas Steinbock, on receiving this broadside, with an accompaniment\nof looks that pierced him like a magnetic flame, bent his head. The most\nmalignant slanderer on seeing this scene would at once have understood\nthat the hints thrown out by the Oliviers were false. Everything in this\ncouple, their tone, manner, and way of looking at each other, proved the\npurity of their private live. The old maid showed the affection of\nrough but very genuine maternal feeling; the young man submitted, as a\nrespectful son yields to the tyranny of a mother. The strange alliance\nseemed to be the outcome of a strong will acting constantly on a weak\ncharacter, on the fluid nature peculiar to the Slavs, which, while it\ndoes not hinder them from showing heroic courage in battle, gives\nthem an amazing incoherency of conduct, a moral softness of which\nphysiologists ought to try to detect the causes, since physiologists are\nto political life what entomologists are to agriculture.\n\n\"But if I die before I am rich?\" said Wenceslas dolefully.\n\n\"Die!\" cried she. \"Oh, I will not let you die. I have life enough for\nboth, and I would have my blood injected into your veins if necessary.\"\n\nTears rose to Steinbock's eyes as he heard her vehement and artless\nspeech.\n\n\"Do not be unhappy, my little Wenceslas,\" said Lisbeth with feeling. \"My\ncousin Hortense thought your seal quite pretty, I am sure; and I will\nmanage to sell your bronze group, you will see; you will have paid me\noff, you will be able to do as you please, you will soon be free. Come,\nsmile a little!\"\n\n\"I can never repay you, mademoiselle,\" said the exile.\n\n\"And why not?\" asked the peasant woman, taking the Livonian's part\nagainst herself.\n\n\"Because you not only fed me, lodged me, cared for me in my poverty, but\nyou also gave me strength. You have made me what I am; you have often\nbeen stern, you have made me very unhappy----\"\n\n\"I?\" said the old maid. \"Are you going to pour out all your nonsense\nonce more about poetry and the arts, and to crack your fingers and\nstretch your arms while you spout about the ideal, and beauty, and all\nyour northern madness?--Beauty is not to compare with solid pudding--and\nwhat am I!--You have ideas in your brain? What is the use of them? I too\nhave ideas. What is the good of all the fine things you may have in your\nsoul if you can make no use of them? Those who have ideas do not get so\nfar as those who have none, if they don't know which way to go.\n\n\"Instead of thinking over your ideas you must work.--Now, what have you\ndone while I was out?\"\n\n\"What did your pretty cousin say?\"\n\n\"Who told you she was pretty?\" asked Lisbeth sharply, in a tone hollow\nwith tiger-like jealousy.\n\n\"Why, you did.\"\n\n\"That was only to see your face. Do you want to go trotting after\npetticoats? You who are so fond of women, well, make them in bronze.\nLet us see a cast of your desires, for you will have to do without the\nladies for some little time yet, and certainly without my cousin, my\ngood fellow. She is not game for your bag; that young lady wants a man\nwith sixty thousand francs a year--and has found him!\n\n\"Why, your bed is not made!\" she exclaimed, looking into the adjoining\nroom. \"Poor dear boy, I quite forgot you!\"\n\nThe sturdy woman pulled off her gloves, her cape and bonnet, and remade\nthe artist's little camp bed as briskly as any housemaid. This mixture\nof abruptness, of roughness even, with real kindness, perhaps accounts\nfor the ascendency Lisbeth had acquired over the man whom she regarded\nas her personal property. Is not our attachment to life based on its\nalternations of good and evil?\n\nIf the Livonian had happened to meet Madame Marneffe instead of Lisbeth\nFischer, he would have found a protectress whose complaisance must have\nled him into some boggy or discreditable path, where he would have been\nlost. He would certainly never have worked, nor the artist have been\nhatched out. Thus, while he deplored the old maid's grasping avarice,\nhis reason bid him prefer her iron hand to the life of idleness and\nperil led by many of his fellow-countrymen.\n\n\n\nThis was the incident that had given rise to the coalition of female\nenergy and masculine feebleness--a contrast in union said not to be\nuncommon in Poland.\n\nIn 1833 Mademoiselle Fischer, who sometimes worked into the night when\nbusiness was good, at about one o'clock one morning perceived a strong\nsmell of carbonic acid gas, and heard the groans of a dying man. The\nfumes and the gasping came from a garret over the two rooms forming her\ndwelling, and she supposed that a young man who had but lately come\nto lodge in this attic--which had been vacant for three years--was\ncommitting suicide. She ran upstairs, broke in the door by a push with\nher peasant strength, and found the lodger writhing on a camp-bed in the\nconvulsions of death. She extinguished the brazier; the door was open,\nthe air rushed in, and the exile was saved. Then, when Lisbeth had\nput him to bed like a patient, and he was asleep, she could detect the\nmotives of his suicide in the destitution of the rooms, where there was\nnothing whatever but a wretched table, the camp-bed, and two chairs.\n\nOn the table lay a document, which she read:\n\n  \"I am Count Wenceslas Steinbock, born at Prelia, in Livonia.\n\n  \"No one is to be accused of my death; my reasons for killing\n  myself are, in the words of Kosciusko, _Finis Polonioe_!\n\n  \"The grand-nephew of a valiant General under Charles XII. could\n  not beg. My weakly constitution forbids my taking military\n  service, and I yesterday saw the last of the hundred thalers which\n  I had brought with me from Dresden to Paris. I have left\n  twenty-five francs in the drawer of this table to pay the rent I owe\n  to the landlord.\n\n  \"My parents being dead, my death will affect nobody. I desire that\n  my countrymen will not blame the French Government. I have never\n  registered myself as a refugee, and I have asked for nothing; I\n  have met none of my fellow-exiles; no one in Paris knows of my\n  existence.\n\n  \"I am dying in Christian beliefs. May God forgive the last of the\n  Steinbocks!\n\n\"WENCESLAS.\"\n\n\nMademoiselle Fischer, deeply touched by the dying man's honesty, opened\nthe drawer and found the five five-franc pieces to pay his rent.\n\n\"Poor young man!\" cried she. \"And with no one in the world to care about\nhim!\"\n\nShe went downstairs to fetch her work, and sat stitching in the garret,\nwatching over the Livonian gentleman.\n\nWhen he awoke his astonishment may be imagined on finding a woman\nsitting by his bed; it was like the prolongation of a dream. As she sat\nthere, covering aiguillettes with gold thread, the old maid had resolved\nto take charge of the poor youth whom she admired as he lay sleeping.\n\nAs soon as the young Count was fully awake, Lisbeth talked to give him\ncourage, and questioned him to find out how he might make a living.\nWenceslas, after telling his story, added that he owed his position\nto his acknowledged talent for the fine arts. He had always had a\npreference for sculpture; the necessary time for study had, however,\nseemed to him too long for a man without money; and at this moment he\nwas far too weak to do any hard manual labor or undertake an important\nwork in sculpture. All this was Greek to Lisbeth Fischer. She replied\nto the unhappy man that Paris offered so many openings that any man with\nwill and courage might find a living there. A man of spirit need never\nperish if he had a certain stock of endurance.\n\n\"I am but a poor girl myself, a peasant, and I have managed to make\nmyself independent,\" said she in conclusion. \"If you will work in\nearnest, I have saved a little money, and I will lend you, month by\nmonth, enough to live upon; but to live frugally, and not to play ducks\nand drakes with or squander in the streets. You can dine in Paris for\ntwenty-five sous a day, and I will get you your breakfast with mine\nevery day. I will furnish your rooms and pay for such teaching as you\nmay think necessary. You shall give me formal acknowledgment for the\nmoney I may lay out for you, and when you are rich you shall repay me\nall. But if you do not work, I shall not regard myself as in any way\npledged to you, and I shall leave you to your fate.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried the poor fellow, still smarting from the bitterness of his\nfirst struggle with death, \"exiles from every land may well stretch out\ntheir hands to France, as the souls in Purgatory do to Paradise. In what\nother country is such help to be found, and generous hearts even in such\na garret as this? You will be everything to me, my beloved benefactress;\nI am your slave! Be my sweetheart,\" he added, with one of the caressing\ngestures familiar to the Poles, for which they are unjustly accused of\nservility.\n\n\"Oh, no; I am too jealous, I should make you unhappy; but I will gladly\nbe a sort of comrade,\" replied Lisbeth.\n\n\"Ah, if only you knew how I longed for some fellow-creature, even a\ntyrant, who would have something to say to me when I was struggling in\nthe vast solitude of Paris!\" exclaimed Wenceslas. \"I regretted\nSiberia, whither I should be sent by the Emperor if I went home.--Be my\nProvidence!--I will work; I will be a better man than I am, though I am\nnot such a bad fellow!\"\n\n\"Will you do whatever I bid you?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I will adopt you as my child,\" said she lightly. \"Here I am\nwith a son risen from the grave. Come! we will begin at once. I will go\nout and get what I want; you can dress, and come down to breakfast with\nme when I knock on the ceiling with the broomstick.\"\n\nThat day, Mademoiselle Fischer made some inquiries, at the houses to\nwhich she carried her work home, as to the business of a sculptor.\nBy dint of many questions she ended by hearing of the studio kept by\nFlorent and Chanor, a house that made a special business of casting and\nfinishing decorative bronzes and handsome silver plate. Thither she went\nwith Steinbock, recommending him as an apprentice in sculpture, an idea\nthat was regarded as too eccentric. Their business was to copy the\nworks of the greatest artists, but they did not teach the craft. The old\nmaid's persistent obstinacy so far succeeded that Steinbock was taken on\nto design ornament. He very soon learned to model ornament, and invented\nnovelties; he had a gift for it.\n\nFive months after he was out of his apprenticeship as a finisher, he\nmade acquaintance with Stidmann, the famous head of Florent's studios.\nWithin twenty months Wenceslas was ahead of his master; but in thirty\nmonths the old maid's savings of sixteen years had melted entirely. Two\nthousand five hundred francs in gold!--a sum with which she had intended\nto purchase an annuity; and what was there to show for it? A Pole's\nreceipt! And at this moment Lisbeth was working as hard as in her young\ndays to supply the needs of her Livonian.\n\nWhen she found herself the possessor of a piece of paper instead of her\ngold louis, she lost her head, and went to consult Monsieur Rivet,\nwho for fifteen years had been his clever head-worker's friend and\ncounselor. On hearing her story, Monsieur and Madame Rivet scolded\nLisbeth, told her she was crazy, abused all refugees whose plots for\nreconstructing their nation compromised the prosperity of the country\nand the maintenance of peace; and they urged Lisbeth to find what in\ntrade is called security.\n\n\"The only hold you have over this fellow is on his liberty,\" observed\nMonsieur Rivet.\n\nMonsieur Achille Rivet was assessor at the Tribunal of Commerce.\n\n\"Imprisonment is no joke for a foreigner,\" said he. \"A Frenchman remains\nfive years in prison and comes out, free of his debts to be sure, for\nhe is thenceforth bound only by his conscience, and that never troubles\nhim; but a foreigner never comes out.--Give me your promissory note; my\nbookkeeper will take it up; he will get it protested; you will both be\nprosecuted and both be condemned to imprisonment in default of payment;\nthen, when everything is in due form, you must sign a declaration.\nBy doing this your interest will be accumulating, and you will have a\npistol always primed to fire at your Pole!\"\n\nThe old maid allowed these legal steps to be taken, telling her protege\nnot to be uneasy, as the proceedings were merely to afford a guarantee\nto a money-lender who agreed to advance them certain sums. This\nsubterfuge was due to the inventive genius of Monsieur Rivet. The\nguileless artist, blindly trusting to his benefactress, lighted his pipe\nwith the stamped paper, for he smoked as all men do who have sorrows or\nenergies that need soothing.\n\nOne fine day Monsieur Rivet showed Mademoiselle Fischer a schedule, and\nsaid to her:\n\n\"Here you have Wenceslas Steinbock bound hand and foot, and so\neffectually, that within twenty-four hours you can have him snug in\nClichy for the rest of his days.\"\n\nThis worthy and honest judge at the Chamber of Commerce experienced\nthat day the satisfaction that must come of having done a malignant good\naction. Beneficence has so many aspects in Paris that this contradictory\nexpression really represents one of them. The Livonian being fairly\nentangled in the toils of commercial procedure, the point was to\nobtain payment; for the illustrious tradesman looked on Wenceslas as\na swindler. Feeling, sincerity, poetry, were in his eyes mere folly in\nbusiness matters.\n\nSo Rivet went off to see, in behalf of that poor Mademoiselle Fischer,\nwho, as he said, had been \"done\" by the Pole, the rich manufacturers for\nwhom Steinbock had worked. It happened that Stidmann--who, with the\nhelp of these distinguished masters of the goldsmiths' art, was raising\nFrench work to the perfection it has now reached, allowing it to hold\nits own against Florence and the Renaissance--Stidmann was in Chanor's\nprivate room when the army lace manufacturer called to make inquiries as\nto \"One Steinbock, a Polish refugee.\"\n\n\"Whom do you call 'One Steinbock'? Do you mean a young Livonian who was\na pupil of mine?\" cried Stidmann ironically. \"I may tell you, monsieur,\nthat he is a very great artist. It is said of me that I believe myself\nto be the Devil. Well, that poor fellow does not know that he is capable\nof becoming a god.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Rivet, well pleased. And then he added, \"Though you take\na rather cavalier tone with a man who has the honor to be an Assessor on\nthe Tribunal of Commerce of the Department of the Seine.\"\n\n\"Your pardon, Consul!\" said Stidmann, with a military salute.\n\n\"I am delighted,\" the Assessor went on, \"to hear what you say. The man\nmay make money then?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Chanor; \"but he must work. He would have a tidy sum by\nnow if he had stayed with us. What is to be done? Artists have a horror\nof not being free.\"\n\n\"They have a proper sense of their value and dignity,\" replied Stidmann.\n\"I do not blame Wenceslas for walking alone, trying to make a name, and\nto become a great man; he had a right to do so! But he was a great loss\nto me when he left.\"\n\n\"That, you see,\" exclaimed Rivet, \"is what all young students aim at as\nsoon as they are hatched out of the school-egg. Begin by saving money, I\nsay, and seek glory afterwards.\"\n\n\"It spoils your touch to be picking up coin,\" said Stidmann. \"It is\nGlory's business to bring us wealth.\"\n\n\"And, after all,\" said Chanor to Rivet, \"you cannot tether them.\"\n\n\"They would eat the halter,\" replied Stidmann.\n\n\"All these gentlemen have as much caprice as talent,\" said Chanor,\nlooking at Stidmann. \"They spend no end of money; they keep their girls,\nthey throw coin out of window, and then they have no time to work. They\nneglect their orders; we have to employ workmen who are very inferior,\nbut who grow rich; and then they complain of the hard times, while, if\nthey were but steady, they might have piles of gold.\"\n\n\"You old Lumignon,\" said Stidmann, \"you remind me of the publisher\nbefore the Revolution who said--'If only I could keep Montesquieu,\nVoltaire, and Rousseau very poor in my backshed, and lock up their\nbreeches in a cupboard, what a lot of nice little books they would write\nto make my fortune.'--If works of art could be hammered out like nails,\nworkmen would make them.--Give me a thousand francs, and don't talk\nnonsense.\"\n\nWorthy Monsieur Rivet went home, delighted for poor Mademoiselle\nFischer, who dined with him every Monday, and whom he found waiting for\nhim.\n\n\"If you can only make him work,\" said he, \"you will have more luck than\nwisdom; you will be repaid, interest, capital, and costs. This Pole has\ntalent, he can make a living; but lock up his trousers and his shoes,\ndo not let him go to the _Chaumiere_ or the parish of Notre-Dame\nde Lorette, keep him in leading-strings. If you do not take such\nprecautions, your artist will take to loafing, and if you only knew what\nthese artists mean by loafing! Shocking! Why, I have just heard that\nthey will spend a thousand-franc note in a day!\"\n\nThis episode had a fatal influence on the home-life of Wenceslas and\nLisbeth. The benefactress flavored the exile's bread with the wormwood\nof reproof, now that she saw her money in danger, and often believed\nit to be lost. From a kind mother she became a stepmother; she took the\npoor boy to task, she nagged him, scolded him for working too slowly,\nand blamed him for having chosen so difficult a profession. She could\nnot believe that those models in red wax--little figures and sketches\nfor ornamental work--could be of any value. Before long, vexed with\nherself for her severity, she would try to efface the tears by her care\nand attention.\n\nThen the poor young man, after groaning to think that he was dependent\non this shrew and under the thumb of a peasant of the Vosges, was\nbewitched by her coaxing ways and by a maternal affection that attached\nitself solely to the physical and material side of life. He was like\na woman who forgives a week of ill-usage for the sake of a kiss and a\nbrief reconciliation.\n\nThus Mademoiselle Fischer obtained complete power over his mind. The\nlove of dominion that lay as a germ in the old maid's heart developed\nrapidly. She could now satisfy her pride and her craving for action; had\nshe not a creature belonging to her, to be schooled, scolded, flattered,\nand made happy, without any fear of a rival? Thus the good and bad sides\nof her nature alike found play. If she sometimes victimized the poor\nartist, she had, on the other hand, delicate impulses like the grace\nof wild flowers; it was a joy to her to provide for all his wants; she\nwould have given her life for him, and Wenceslas knew it. Like every\nnoble soul, the poor fellow forgot the bad points, the defects of the\nwoman who had told him the story of her life as an excuse for her rough\nways, and he remembered only the benefits she had done him.\n\nOne day, exasperated with Wenceslas for having gone out walking instead\nof sitting at work, she made a great scene.\n\n\"You belong to me,\" said she. \"If you were an honest man, you would try\nto repay me the money you owe as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe gentleman, in whose veins the blood of the Steinbocks was fired,\nturned pale.\n\n\"Bless me,\" she went on, \"we soon shall have nothing to live on but the\nthirty sous I earn--a poor work-woman!\"\n\nThe two penniless creatures, worked up by their own war of words, grew\nvehement; and for the first time the unhappy artist reproached his\nbenefactress for having rescued him from death only to make him lead the\nlife of a galley slave, worse than the bottomless void, where at least,\nsaid he, he would have found rest. And he talked of flight.\n\n\"Flight!\" cried Lisbeth. \"Ah, Monsieur Rivet was right.\"\n\nAnd she clearly explained to the Pole that within twenty-four hours he\nmight be clapped into prison for the rest of his days. It was a crushing\nblow. Steinbock sank into deep melancholy and total silence.\n\nIn the course of the following night, Lisbeth hearing overhead some\npreparations for suicide, went up to her pensioner's room, and gave him\nthe schedule and a formal release.\n\n\"Here, dear child, forgive me,\" she said with tears in her eyes. \"Be\nhappy; leave me! I am too cruel to you; only tell me that you will\nsometimes remember the poor girl who has enabled you to make a\nliving.--What can I say? You are the cause of my ill-humor. I might die;\nwhere would you be without me? That is the reason of my being impatient\nto see you do some salable work. I do not want my money back for myself,\nI assure you! I am only frightened at your idleness, which you call\nmeditation; at your ideas, which take up so many hours when you sit\ngazing at the sky; I want you to get into habits of industry.\"\n\nAll this was said with an emphasis, a look, and tears that moved the\nhigh-minded artist; he clasped his benefactress to his heart and kissed\nher forehead.\n\n\"Keep these pieces,\" said he with a sort of cheerfulness. \"Why should\nyou send me to Clichy? Am I not a prisoner here out of gratitude?\"\n\nThis episode of their secret domestic life had occurred six months\npreviously, and had led to Steinbock's producing three finished works:\nthe seal in Hortense's possession, the group he had placed with the\ncuriosity dealer, and a beautiful clock to which he was putting the last\ntouches, screwing in the last rivets.\n\nThis clock represented the twelve Hours, charmingly personified by\ntwelve female figures whirling round in so mad and swift a dance that\nthree little Loves perched on a pile of fruit and flowers could not stop\none of them; only the torn skirts of Midnight remained in the hand of\nthe most daring cherub. The group stood on an admirably treated base,\nornamented with grotesque beasts. The hours were told by a monstrous\nmouth that opened to yawn, and each Hour bore some ingeniously\nappropriate symbol characteristic of the various occupations of the day.\n\nIt is now easy to understand the extraordinary attachment of\nMademoiselle Fischer for her Livonian; she wanted him to be happy,\nand she saw him pining, fading away in his attic. The causes of this\nwretched state of affairs may be easily imagined. The peasant woman\nwatched this son of the North with the affection of a mother, with the\njealousy of a wife, and the spirit of a dragon; hence she managed to\nput every kind of folly or dissipation out of his power by leaving him\ndestitute of money. She longed to keep her victim and companion for\nherself alone, well conducted perforce, and she had no conception of\nthe cruelty of this senseless wish, since she, for her own part, was\naccustomed to every privation. She loved Steinbock well enough not to\nmarry him, and too much to give him up to any other woman; she could not\nresign herself to be no more than a mother to him, though she saw that\nshe was mad to think of playing the other part.\n\nThese contradictions, this ferocious jealousy, and the joy of having a\nman to herself, all agitated her old maid's heart beyond measure. Really\nin love as she had been for four years, she cherished the foolish hope\nof prolonging this impossible and aimless way of life in which her\npersistence would only be the ruin of the man she thought of as her\nchild. This contest between her instincts and her reason made her unjust\nand tyrannical. She wreaked on the young man her vengeance for her own\nlot in being neither young, rich, nor handsome; then, after each fit\nof rage, recognizing herself wrong, she stooped to unlimited humility,\ninfinite tenderness. She never could sacrifice to her idol till she had\nasserted her power by blows of the axe. In fact, it was the converse of\nShakespeare's _Tempest_--Caliban ruling Ariel and Prospero.\n\nAs to the poor youth himself, high-minded, meditative, and inclined to\nbe lazy, the desert that his protectress made in his soul might be seen\nin his eyes, as in those of a caged lion. The penal servitude forced on\nhim by Lisbeth did not fulfil the cravings of his heart. His weariness\nbecame a physical malady, and he was dying without daring to ask,\nor knowing where to procure, the price of some little necessary\ndissipation. On some days of special energy, when a feeling of utter\nill-luck added to his exasperation, he would look at Lisbeth as a\nthirsty traveler on a sandy shore must look at the bitter sea-water.\n\nThese harsh fruits of indigence, and this isolation in the midst of\nParis, Lisbeth relished with delight. And besides, she foresaw that\nthe first passion would rob her of her slave. Sometimes she even blamed\nherself because her own tyranny and reproaches had compelled the poetic\nyouth to become so great an artist of delicate work, and she had thus\ngiven him the means of casting her off.\n\n\n\nOn the day after, these three lives, so differently but so utterly\nwretched--that of a mother in despair, that of the Marneffe household,\nand that of the unhappy exile--were all to be influenced by Hortense's\nguileless passion, and by the strange outcome of the Baron's luckless\npassion for Josepha.\n\nJust as Hulot was going into the opera-house, he was stopped by the\ndarkened appearance of the building and of the Rue le Peletier, where\nthere were no gendarmes, no lights, no theatre-servants, no barrier to\nregulate the crowd. He looked up at the announcement-board, and beheld a\nstrip of white paper, on which was printed the solemn notice:\n\n\"CLOSED ON ACCOUNT OF ILLNESS.\"\n\nHe rushed off to Josepha's lodgings in the Rue Chauchat; for, like all\nthe singers, she lived close at hand.\n\n\"Whom do you want, sir?\" asked the porter, to the Baron's great\nastonishment.\n\n\"Have you forgotten me?\" said Hulot, much puzzled.\n\n\"On the contrary, sir, it is because I have the honor to remember you\nthat I ask you, Where are you going?\"\n\nA mortal chill fell upon the Baron.\n\n\"What has happened?\" he asked.\n\n\"If you go up to Mademoiselle Mirah's rooms, Monsieur le Baron, you will\nfind Mademoiselle Heloise Brisetout there--and Monsieur Bixiou, Monsieur\nLeon de Lora, Monsieur Lousteau, Monsieur de Vernisset, Monsieur\nStidmann; and ladies smelling of patchouli--holding a housewarming.\"\n\n\"Then, where--where is----?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle Mirah?--I don't know that I ought to tell you.\"\n\nThe Baron slipped two five-franc pieces into the porter's hand.\n\n\"Well, she is now in the Rue de la Ville l'Eveque, in a fine house,\ngiven to her, they say, by the Duc d'Herouville,\" replied the man in a\nwhisper.\n\nHaving ascertained the number of the house, Monsieur Hulot called a\n_milord_ and drove to one of those pretty modern houses with double\ndoors, where everything, from the gaslight at the entrance, proclaims\nluxury.\n\nThe Baron, in his blue cloth coat, white neckcloth, nankeen trousers,\npatent leather boots, and stiffly starched shirt-frill, was supposed to\nbe a guest, though a late arrival, by the janitor of this new Eden. His\nalacrity of manner and quick step justified this opinion.\n\nThe porter rang a bell, and a footman appeared in the hall. This man, as\nnew as the house, admitted the visitor, who said to him in an imperious\ntone, and with a lordly gesture:\n\n\"Take in this card to Mademoiselle Josepha.\"\n\nThe victim mechanically looked round the room in which he found\nhimself--an anteroom full of choice flowers and of furniture that must\nhave cost twenty thousand francs. The servant, on his return, begged\nmonsieur to wait in the drawing-room till the company came to their\ncoffee.\n\nThough the Baron had been familiar with Imperial luxury, which was\nundoubtedly prodigious, while its productions, though not durable in\nkind, had nevertheless cost enormous sums, he stood dazzled, dumfounded,\nin this drawing-room with three windows looking out on a garden like\nfairyland, one of those gardens that are created in a month with a made\nsoil and transplanted shrubs, while the grass seems as if it must\nbe made to grow by some chemical process. He admired not only the\ndecoration, the gilding, the carving, in the most expensive Pompadour\nstyle, as it is called, and the magnificent brocades, all of which any\nenriched tradesman could have procured for money; but he also noted\nsuch treasures as only princes can select and find, can pay for and give\naway; two pictures by Greuze, two by Watteau, two heads by Vandyck, two\nlandscapes by Ruysdael, and two by le Guaspre, a Rembrandt, a Holbein, a\nMurillo, and a Titian, two paintings, by Teniers, and a pair by Metzu,\na Van Huysum, and an Abraham Mignon--in short, two hundred thousand\nfrancs' worth of pictures superbly framed. The gilding was worth almost\nas much as the paintings.\n\n\"Ah, ha! Now you understand, my good man?\" said Josepha.\n\nShe had stolen in on tiptoe through a noiseless door, over Persian\ncarpets, and came upon her adorer, standing lost in amazement--in\nthe stupid amazement when a man's ears tingle so loudly that he hears\nnothing but that fatal knell.\n\nThe words \"my good man,\" spoken to an official of such high importance,\nso perfectly exemplified the audacity with which these creatures\npour contempt on the loftiest, that the Baron was nailed to the spot.\nJosepha, in white and yellow, was so beautifully dressed for the\nbanquet, that amid all this lavish magnificence she still shone like a\nrare jewel.\n\n\"Isn't this really fine?\" said she. \"The Duke has spent all the money on\nit that he got out of floating a company, of which the shares all sold\nat a premium. He is no fool, is my little Duke. There is nothing like a\nman who has been a grandee in his time for turning coals into gold.\nJust before dinner the notary brought me the title-deeds to sign and the\nbills receipted!--They are all a first-class set in there--d'Esgrignon,\nRastignac, Maxime, Lenoncourt, Verneuil, Laginski, Rochefide, la\nPalferine, and from among the bankers Nucingen and du Tillet, with\nAntonia, Malaga, Carabine, and la Schontz; and they all feel for\nyou deeply.--Yes, old boy, and they hope you will join them, but on\ncondition that you forthwith drink up to two bottles full of Hungarian\nwine, Champagne, or Cape, just to bring you up to their mark.--My dear\nfellow, we are all so much _on_ here, that it was necessary to close\nthe Opera. The manager is as drunk as a cornet-a-piston; he is hiccuping\nalready.\"\n\n\"Oh, Josepha!----\" cried the Baron.\n\n\"Now, can anything be more absurd than explanations?\" she broke in with\na smile. \"Look here; can you stand six hundred thousand francs which\nthis house and furniture cost? Can you give me a bond to the tune of\nthirty thousand francs a year, which is what the Duke has just given\nme in a packet of common sugared almonds from the grocer's?--a pretty\nnotion that----\"\n\n\"What an atrocity!\" cried Hulot, who in his fury would have given his\nwife's diamonds to stand in the Duc d'Herouville's shoes for twenty-four\nhours.\n\n\"Atrocity is my trade,\" said she. \"So that is how you take it? Well, why\ndon't you float a company? Goodness me! my poor dyed Tom, you ought to\nbe grateful to me; I have thrown you over just when you would have spent\non me your widow's fortune, your daughter's portion.--What, tears! The\nEmpire is a thing of the past--I hail the coming Empire!\"\n\nShe struck a tragic attitude, and exclaimed:\n\n  \"They call you Hulot! Nay, I know you not--\"\n\nAnd she went into the other room.\n\nThrough the door, left ajar, there came, like a lightning-flash, a\nstreak of light with an accompaniment of the crescendo of the orgy and\nthe fragrance of a banquet of the choicest description.\n\nThe singer peeped through the partly open door, and seeing Hulot\ntransfixed as if he had been a bronze image, she came one step forward\ninto the room.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said she, \"I have handed over the rubbish in the Rue\nChauchat to Bixiou's little Heloise Brisetout. If you wish to claim\nyour cotton nightcap, your bootjack, your belt, and your wax dye, I have\nstipulated for their return.\"\n\nThis insolent banter made the Baron leave the room as precipitately as\nLot departed from Gomorrah, but he did not look back like Mrs. Lot.\n\nHulot went home, striding along in a fury, and talking to himself; he\nfound his family still playing the game of whist at two sous a point, at\nwhich he left them. On seeing her husband return, poor Adeline imagined\nsomething dreadful, some dishonor; she gave her cards to Hortense, and\nled Hector away into the very room where, only five hours since, Crevel\nhad foretold her the utmost disgrace of poverty.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" she said, terrified.\n\n\"Oh, forgive me--but let me tell you all these horrors.\" And for ten\nminutes he poured out his wrath.\n\n\"But, my dear,\" said the unhappy woman, with heroic courage, \"these\ncreatures do not know what love means--such pure and devoted love as you\ndeserve. How could you, so clear-sighted as you are, dream of competing\nwith millions?\"\n\n\"Dearest Adeline!\" cried the Baron, clasping her to his heart.\n\nThe Baroness' words had shed balm on the bleeding wounds to his vanity.\n\n\"To be sure, take away the Duc d'Herouville's fortune, and she could not\nhesitate between us!\" said the Baron.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Adeline with a final effort, \"if you positively must\nhave mistresses, why do you not seek them, like Crevel, among women who\nare less extravagant, and of a class that can for a time be content\nwith little? We should all gain by that arrangement.--I understand your\nneed--but I do not understand that vanity----\"\n\n\"Oh, what a kind and perfect wife you are!\" cried he. \"I am an old\nlunatic, I do not deserve to have such a wife!\"\n\n\"I am simply the Josephine of my Napoleon,\" she replied, with a touch of\nmelancholy.\n\n\"Josephine was not to compare with you!\" said he. \"Come; I will play a\ngame of whist with my brother and the children. I must try my hand at\nthe business of a family man; I must get Hortense a husband, and bury\nthe libertine.\"\n\nHis frankness so greatly touched poor Adeline, that she said:\n\n\"The creature has no taste to prefer any man in the world to my Hector.\nOh, I would not give you up for all the gold on earth. How can any woman\nthrow you over who is so happy as to be loved by you?\"\n\nThe look with which the Baron rewarded his wife's fanaticism confirmed\nher in her opinion that gentleness and docility were a woman's strongest\nweapons.\n\nBut in this she was mistaken. The noblest sentiments, carried to an\nexcess, can produce mischief as great as do the worst vices. Bonaparte\nwas made Emperor for having fired on the people, at a stone's throw from\nthe spot where Louis XVI. lost his throne and his head because he would\nnot allow a certain Monsieur Sauce to be hurt.\n\n\n\nOn the following morning, Hortense, who had slept with the seal under\nher pillow, so as to have it close to her all night, dressed very early,\nand sent to beg her father to join her in the garden as soon as he\nshould be down.\n\nBy about half-past nine, the father, acceding to his daughter's\npetition, gave her his arm for a walk, and they went along the quays by\nthe Pont Royal to the Place du Carrousel.\n\n\"Let us look into the shop windows, papa,\" said Hortense, as they went\nthrough the little gate to cross the wide square.\n\n\"What--here?\" said her father, laughing at her.\n\n\"We are supposed to have come to see the pictures, and over there\"--and\nshe pointed to the stalls in front of the houses at a right angle to\nthe Rue du Doyenne--\"look! there are dealers in curiosities and\npictures----\"\n\n\"Your cousin lives there.\"\n\n\"I know it, but she must not see us.\"\n\n\"And what do you want to do?\" said the Baron, who, finding himself\nwithin thirty yards of Madame Marneffe's windows, suddenly remembered\nher.\n\nHortense had dragged her father in front of one of the shops forming the\nangle of a block of houses built along the front of the Old Louvre, and\nfacing the Hotel de Nantes. She went into this shop; her father stood\noutside, absorbed in gazing at the windows of the pretty little lady,\nwho, the evening before, had left her image stamped on the old beau's\nheart, as if to alleviate the wound he was so soon to receive; and he\ncould not help putting his wife's sage advice into practice.\n\n\"I will fall back on a simple little citizen's wife,\" said he to\nhimself, recalling Madame Marneffe's adorable graces. \"Such a woman as\nthat will soon make me forget that grasping Josepha.\"\n\nNow, this was what was happening at the same moment outside and inside\nthe curiosity shop.\n\nAs he fixed his eyes on the windows of his new _belle_, the Baron\nsaw the husband, who, while brushing his coat with his own hands, was\napparently on the lookout, expecting to see some one on the square.\nFearing lest he should be seen, and subsequently recognized, the\namorous Baron turned his back on the Rue du Doyenne, or rather stood at\nthree-quarters' face, as it were, so as to be able to glance round\nfrom time to time. This manoeuvre brought him face to face with Madame\nMarneffe, who, coming up from the quay, was doubling the promontory of\nhouses to go home.\n\nValerie was evidently startled as she met the Baron's astonished eye,\nand she responded with a prudish dropping of her eyelids.\n\n\"A pretty woman,\" exclaimed he, \"for whom a man would do many foolish\nthings.\"\n\n\"Indeed, monsieur?\" said she, turning suddenly, like a woman who has\njust come to some vehement decision, \"you are Monsieur le Baron Hulot, I\nbelieve?\"\n\nThe Baron, more and more bewildered, bowed assent.\n\n\"Then, as chance has twice made our eyes meet, and I am so fortunate as\nto have interested or puzzled you, I may tell you that, instead of doing\nanything foolish, you ought to do justice.--My husband's fate rests with\nyou.\"\n\n\"And how may that be?\" asked the gallant Baron.\n\n\"He is employed in your department in the War Office, under Monsieur\nLebrun, in Monsieur Coquet's room,\" said she with a smile.\n\n\"I am quite disposed, Madame--Madame----?\"\n\n\"Madame Marneffe.\"\n\n\"Dear little Madame Marneffe, to do injustice for your sake.--I have a\ncousin living in your house; I will go to see her one day soon--as soon\nas possible; bring your petition to me in her rooms.\"\n\n\"Pardon my boldness, Monsieur le Baron; you must understand that if\nI dare to address you thus, it is because I have no friend to protect\nme----\"\n\n\"Ah, ha!\"\n\n\"Monsieur, you misunderstand me,\" said she, lowering her eyelids.\n\nHulot felt as if the sun had disappeared.\n\n\"I am at my wits' end, but I am an honest woman!\" she went on. \"About\nsix months ago my only protector died, Marshal Montcornet--\"\n\n\"Ah! You are his daughter?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur; but he never acknowledged me.\"\n\n\"That was that he might leave you part of his fortune.\"\n\n\"He left me nothing; he made no will.\"\n\n\"Indeed! Poor little woman! The Marshal died suddenly of apoplexy. But,\ncome, madame, hope for the best. The State must do something for the\ndaughter of one of the Chevalier Bayards of the Empire.\"\n\nMadame Marneffe bowed gracefully and went off, as proud of her success\nas the Baron was of his.\n\n\"Where the devil has she been so early?\" thought he watching the flow\nof her skirts, to which she contrived to impart a somewhat exaggerated\ngrace. \"She looks too tired to have just come from a bath, and her\nhusband is waiting for her. It is strange, and puzzles me altogether.\"\n\nMadame Marneffe having vanished within, the Baron wondered what his\ndaughter was doing in the shop. As he went in, still staring at Madame\nMarneffe's windows, he ran against a young man with a pale brow and\nsparkling gray eyes, wearing a summer coat of black merino, coarse drill\ntrousers, and tan shoes, with gaiters, rushing away headlong; he saw him\nrun to the house in the Rue du Doyenne, into which he went.\n\nHortense, on going into the shop, had at once recognized the famous\ngroup, conspicuously placed on a table in the middle and in front of the\ndoor. Even without the circumstances to which she owed her knowledge\nof this masterpiece, it would probably have struck her by the peculiar\npower which we must call the _brio_--the _go_--of great works; and\nthe girl herself might in Italy have been taken as a model for the\npersonification of _Brio_.\n\nNot every work by a man of genius has in the same degree that\nbrilliancy, that glory which is at once patent even to the most\nignoble beholder. Thus, certain pictures by Raphael, such as the famous\n_Transfiguration_, the _Madonna di Foligno_, and the frescoes of the\n_Stanze_ in the Vatican, do not at first captivate our admiration, as\ndo the _Violin-player_ in the Sciarra Palace, the portraits of the Doria\nfamily, and the _Vision of Ezekiel_ in the Pitti Gallery, the _Christ\nbearing His Cross_ in the Borghese collection, and the _Marriage of\nthe Virgin_ in the Brera at Milan. The _Saint John the Baptist_ of\nthe Tribuna, and _Saint Luke painting the Virgin's portrait_ in the\nAccademia at Rome, have not the charm of the _Portrait of Leo X._, and\nof the _Virgin_ at Dresden.\n\nAnd yet they are all of equal merit. Nay, more. The _Stanze_, the\n_Transfiguration_, the panels, and the three easel pictures in the\nVatican are in the highest degree perfect and sublime. But they demand\na stress of attention, even from the most accomplished beholder, and\nserious study, to be fully understood; while the _Violin-player_, the\n_Marriage of the Virgin_, and the _Vision of Ezekiel_ go straight to the\nheart through the portal of sight, and make their home there. It is\na pleasure to receive them thus without an effort; if it is not the\nhighest phase of art, it is the happiest. This fact proves that, in the\nbegetting of works of art, there is as much chance in the character of\nthe offspring as there is in a family of children; that some will\nbe happily graced, born beautiful, and costing their mothers little\nsuffering, creatures on whom everything smiles, and with whom everything\nsucceeds; in short, genius, like love, has its fairer blossoms.\n\nThis _brio_, an Italian word which the French have begun to use, is\ncharacteristic of youthful work. It is the fruit of an impetus and fire\nof early talent--an impetus which is met with again later in some happy\nhours; but this particular _brio_ no longer comes from the artist's\nheart; instead of his flinging it into his work as a volcano flings up\nits fires, it comes to him from outside, inspired by circumstances, by\nlove, or rivalry, often by hatred, and more often still by the imperious\nneed of glory to be lived up to.\n\nThis group by Wenceslas was to his later works what the _Marriage of the\nVirgin_ is to the great mass of Raphael's, the first step of a gifted\nartist taken with the inimitable grace, the eagerness, and delightful\noverflowingness of a child, whose strength is concealed under the\npink-and-white flesh full of dimples which seem to echo to a mother's\nlaughter. Prince Eugene is said to have paid four hundred thousand\nfrancs for this picture, which would be worth a million to any nation\nthat owned no picture by Raphael, but no one would give that sum for the\nfinest of the frescoes, though their value is far greater as works of\nart.\n\nHortense restrained her admiration, for she reflected on the amount of\nher girlish savings; she assumed an air of indifference, and said to the\ndealer:\n\n\"What is the price of that?\"\n\n\"Fifteen hundred francs,\" replied the man, sending a glance of\nintelligence to a young man seated on a stool in the corner.\n\nThe young man himself gazed in a stupefaction at Monsieur Hulot's living\nmasterpiece. Hortense, forewarned, at once identified him as the artist,\nfrom the color that flushed a face pale with endurance; she saw the\nspark lighted up in his gray eyes by her question; she looked on the\nthin, drawn features, like those of a monk consumed by asceticism; she\nloved the red, well-formed mouth, the delicate chin, and the Pole's\nsilky chestnut hair.\n\n\"If it were twelve hundred,\" said she, \"I would beg you to send it to\nme.\"\n\n\"It is antique, mademoiselle,\" the dealer remarked, thinking, like\nall his fraternity, that, having uttered this _ne plus ultra_ of\nbric-a-brac, there was no more to be said.\n\n\"Excuse me, monsieur,\" she replied very quietly, \"it was made this year;\nI came expressly to beg you, if my price is accepted, to send the\nartist to see us, as it might be possible to procure him some important\ncommissions.\"\n\n\"And if he is to have the twelve hundred francs, what am I to get? I am\nthe dealer,\" said the man, with candid good-humor.\n\n\"To be sure!\" replied the girl, with a slight curl of disdain.\n\n\"Oh! mademoiselle, take it; I will make terms with the dealer,\" cried\nthe Livonian, beside himself.\n\nFascinated by Hortense's wonderful beauty and the love of art she\ndisplayed, he added:\n\n\"I am the sculptor of the group, and for ten days I have come here three\ntimes a day to see if anybody would recognize its merit and bargain for\nit. You are my first admirer--take it!\"\n\n\"Come, then, monsieur, with the dealer, an hour hence.--Here is my\nfather's card,\" replied Hortense.\n\nThen, seeing the shopkeeper go into a back room to wrap the group in a\npiece of linen rag, she added in a low voice, to the great astonishment\nof the artist, who thought he must be dreaming:\n\n\"For the benefit of your future prospects, Monsieur Wenceslas, do not\nmention the name of the purchaser to Mademoiselle Fischer, for she is\nour cousin.\"\n\nThe word cousin dazzled the artist's mind; he had a glimpse of Paradise\nwhence this daughter of Eve had come to him. He had dreamed of the\nbeautiful girl of whom Lisbeth had told him, as Hortense had dreamed of\nher cousin's lover; and, as she had entered the shop--\n\n\"Ah!\" thought he, \"if she could but be like this!\"\n\nThe look that passed between the lovers may be imagined; it was a flame,\nfor virtuous lovers have no hypocrisies.\n\n\"Well, what the deuce are you doing here?\" her father asked her.\n\n\"I have been spending twelve hundred francs that I had saved. Come.\" And\nshe took her father's arm.\n\n\"Twelve hundred francs?\" he repeated.\n\n\"To be exact, thirteen hundred; you will lend me the odd hundred?\"\n\n\"And on what, in such a place, could you spend so much?\"\n\n\"Ah! that is the question!\" replied the happy girl. \"If I have got a\nhusband, he is not dear at the money.\"\n\n\"A husband! In that shop, my child?\"\n\n\"Listen, dear little father; would you forbid my marrying a great\nartist?\"\n\n\"No, my dear. A great artist in these days is a prince without a\ntitle--he has glory and fortune, the two chief social advantages--next\nto virtue,\" he added, in a smug tone.\n\n\"Oh, of course!\" said Hortense. \"And what do you think of sculpture?\"\n\n\"It is very poor business,\" replied Hulot, shaking his head. \"It needs\nhigh patronage as well as great talent, for Government is the only\npurchaser. It is an art with no demand nowadays, where there are no\nprincely houses, no great fortunes, no entailed mansions, no hereditary\nestates. Only small pictures and small figures can find a place; the\narts are endangered by this need of small things.\"\n\n\"But if a great artist could find a demand?\" said Hortense.\n\n\"That indeed would solve the problem.\"\n\n\"Or had some one to back him?\"\n\n\"That would be even better.\"\n\n\"If he were of noble birth?\"\n\n\"Pooh!\"\n\n\"A Count.\"\n\n\"And a sculptor?\"\n\n\"He has no money.\"\n\n\"And so he counts on that of Mademoiselle Hortense Hulot?\" said the\nBaron ironically, with an inquisitorial look into his daughter's eyes.\n\n\"This great artist, a Count and a sculptor, has just seen your daughter\nfor the first time in his life, and for the space of five minutes,\nMonsieur le Baron,\" Hortense calmly replied. \"Yesterday, you must know,\ndear little father, while you were at the Chamber, mamma had a fainting\nfit. This, which she ascribed to a nervous attack, was the result of\nsome worry that had to do with the failure of my marriage, for she told\nme that to get rid of me---\"\n\n\"She is too fond of you to have used an expression----\"\n\n\"So unparliamentary!\" Hortense put in with a laugh. \"No, she did not use\nthose words; but I know that a girl old enough to marry and who does not\nfind a husband is a heavy cross for respectable parents to bear.--Well,\nshe thinks that if a man of energy and talent could be found, who would\nbe satisfied with thirty thousand francs for my marriage portion, we\nmight all be happy. In fact, she thought it advisable to prepare me for\nthe modesty of my future lot, and to hinder me from indulging in too\nfervid dreams.--Which evidently meant an end to the intended marriage,\nand no settlements for me!\"\n\n\"Your mother is a very good woman, noble, admirable!\" replied the\nfather, deeply humiliated, though not sorry to hear this confession.\n\n\"She told me yesterday that she had your permission to sell her diamonds\nso as to give me something to marry on; but I should like her to keep\nher jewels, and to find a husband myself. I think I have found the man,\nthe possible husband, answering to mamma's prospectus----\"\n\n\"There?--in the Place du Carrousel?--and in one morning?\"\n\n\"Oh, papa, the mischief lies deeper!\" said she archly.\n\n\"Well, come, my child, tell the whole story to your good old father,\"\nsaid he persuasively, and concealing his uneasiness.\n\nUnder promise of absolute secrecy, Hortense repeated the upshot of her\nvarious conversations with her Cousin Betty. Then, when they got home,\nshe showed the much-talked-of-seal to her father in evidence of the\nsagacity of her views. The father, in the depth of his heart, wondered\nat the skill and acumen of girls who act on instinct, discerning the\nsimplicity of the scheme which her idealized love had suggested in the\ncourse of a single night to his guileless daughter.\n\n\"You will see the masterpiece I have just bought; it is to be brought\nhome, and that dear Wenceslas is to come with the dealer.--The man who\nmade that group ought to make a fortune; only use your influence to get\nhim an order for a statue, and rooms at the Institut----\"\n\n\"How you run on!\" cried her father. \"Why, if you had your own way, you\nwould be man and wife within the legal period--in eleven days----\"\n\n\"Must we wait so long?\" said she, laughing. \"But I fell in love with him\nin five minutes, as you fell in love with mamma at first sight. And he\nloves me as if we had known each other for two years. Yes,\" she said in\nreply to her father's look, \"I read ten volumes of love in his eyes. And\nwill not you and mamma accept him as my husband when you see that he\nis a man of genius? Sculpture is the greatest of the Arts,\" she cried,\nclapping her hands and jumping. \"I will tell you everything----\"\n\n\"What, is there more to come?\" asked her father, smiling.\n\nThe child's complete and effervescent innocence had restored her\nfather's peace of mind.\n\n\"A confession of the first importance,\" said she. \"I loved him without\nknowing him; and, for the last hour, since seeing him, I am crazy about\nhim.\"\n\n\"A little too crazy!\" said the Baron, who was enjoying the sight of this\nguileless passion.\n\n\"Do not punish me for confiding in you,\" replied she. \"It is so\ndelightful to say to my father's heart, 'I love him! I am so happy in\nloving him!'--You will see my Wenceslas! His brow is so sad. The sun\nof genius shines in his gray eyes--and what an air he has! What do you\nthink of Livonia? Is it a fine country?--The idea of Cousin Betty's\nmarrying that young fellow! She might be his mother. It would be murder!\nI am quite jealous of all she has ever done for him. But I don't think\nmy marriage will please her.\"\n\n\"See, my darling, we must hide nothing from your mother.\"\n\n\"I should have to show her the seal, and I promised not to betray Cousin\nLisbeth, who is afraid, she says, of mamma's laughing at her,\" said\nHortense.\n\n\"You have scruples about the seal, and none about robbing your cousin of\nher lover.\"\n\n\"I promised about the seal--I made no promise about the sculptor.\"\n\nThis adventure, patriarchal in its simplicity, came admirably _a propos_\nto the unconfessed poverty of the family; the Baron, while praising\nhis daughter for her candor, explained to her that she must now leave\nmatters to the discretion of her parents.\n\n\"You understand, my child, that it is not your part to ascertain whether\nyour cousin's lover is a Count, if he has all his papers properly\ncertified, and if his conduct is a guarantee for his respectability.--As\nfor your cousin, she refused five offers when she was twenty years\nyounger; that will prove no obstacle, I undertake to say.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, papa; if you really wish to see me married, never say a\nword to Lisbeth about it till just before the contract is signed. I have\nbeen catechizing her about this business for the last six months! Well,\nthere is something about her quite inexplicable----\"\n\n\"What?\" said her father, puzzled.\n\n\"Well, she looks evil when I say too much, even in joke, about her\nlover. Make inquiries, but leave me to row my own boat. My confidence\nought to reassure you.\"\n\n\"The Lord said, 'Suffer little children to come unto Me.' You are one\nof those who have come back again,\" replied the Baron with a touch of\nirony.\n\nAfter breakfast the dealer was announced, and the artist with his group.\nThe sudden flush that reddened her daughter's face at once made the\nBaroness suspicious and then watchful, and the girl's confusion and\nthe light in her eyes soon betrayed the mystery so badly guarded in her\nsimple heart.\n\nCount Steinbock, dressed in black, struck the Baron as a very\ngentlemanly young man.\n\n\"Would you undertake a bronze statue?\" he asked, as he held up the\ngroup.\n\nAfter admiring it on trust, he passed it on to his wife, who knew\nnothing about sculpture.\n\n\"It is beautiful, isn't it, mamma?\" said Hortense in her mother' ear.\n\n\"A statue! Monsieur, it is less difficult to execute a statue than to\nmake a clock like this, which my friend here has been kind enough to\nbring,\" said the artist in reply.\n\nThe dealer was placing on the dining-room sideboard the wax model of the\ntwelve Hours that the Loves were trying to delay.\n\n\"Leave the clock with me,\" said the Baron, astounded at the beauty of\nthe sketch. \"I should like to show it to the Ministers of the Interior\nand of Commerce.\"\n\n\"Who is the young man in whom you take so much interest?\" the Baroness\nasked her daughter.\n\n\"An artist who could afford to execute this model could get a hundred\nthousand francs for it,\" said the curiosity-dealer, putting on a\nknowing and mysterious look as he saw that the artist and the girl were\ninterchanging glances. \"He would only need to sell twenty copies\nat eight thousand francs each--for the materials would cost about a\nthousand crowns for each example. But if each copy were numbered and\nthe mould destroyed, it would certainly be possible to meet with twenty\namateurs only too glad to possess a replica of such a work.\"\n\n\"A hundred thousand francs!\" cried Steinbock, looking from the dealer to\nHortense, the Baron, and the Baroness.\n\n\"Yes, a hundred thousand francs,\" repeated the dealer. \"If I were rich\nenough, I would buy it of you myself for twenty thousand francs; for by\ndestroying the mould it would become a valuable property. But one of the\nprinces ought to pay thirty or forty thousand francs for such a work to\nornament his drawing-room. No man has ever succeeded in making a clock\nsatisfactory alike to the vulgar and to the connoisseur, and this one,\nsir, solves the difficulty.\"\n\n\"This is for yourself, monsieur,\" said Hortense, giving six gold pieces\nto the dealer.\n\n\"Never breath a word of this visit to any one living,\" said the artist\nto his friend, at the door. \"If you should be asked where we sold the\ngroup, mention the Duc d'Herouville, the famous collector in the Rue de\nVarenne.\"\n\nThe dealer nodded assent.\n\n\"And your name?\" said Hulot to the artist when he came back.\n\n\"Count Steinbock.\"\n\n\"Have you the papers that prove your identity?\"\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur le Baron. They are in Russian and in German, but not\nlegalized.\"\n\n\"Do you feel equal to undertaking a statue nine feet high?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Well, then, if the persons whom I shall consult are satisfied with\nyour work, I can secure you the commission for the statue of Marshal\nMontcornet, which is to be erected on his monument at Pere-Lachaise.\nThe Minister of War and the old officers of the Imperial Guard have\nsubscribed a sum large enough to enable us to select our artist.\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur, it will make my fortune!\" exclaimed Steinbock,\noverpowered by so much happiness at once.\n\n\"Be easy,\" replied the Baron graciously. \"If the two ministers to whom\nI propose to show your group and this sketch in wax are delighted with\nthese two pieces, your prospects of a fortune are good.\"\n\nHortense hugged her father's arm so tightly as to hurt him.\n\n\"Bring me your papers, and say nothing of your hopes to anybody, not\neven to our old Cousin Betty.\"\n\n\"Lisbeth?\" said Madame Hulot, at last understanding the end of all this,\nthough unable to guess the means.\n\n\"I could give proof of my skill by making a bust of the Baroness,\" added\nWenceslas.\n\nThe artist, struck by Madame Hulot's beauty, was comparing the mother\nand daughter.\n\n\"Indeed, monsieur, life may smile upon you,\" said the Baron, quite\ncharmed by Count Steinbock's refined and elegant manner. \"You will find\nout that in Paris no man is clever for nothing, and that persevering\ntoil always finds its reward here.\"\n\nHortense, with a blush, held out to the young man a pretty Algerine\npurse containing sixty gold pieces. The artist, with something still\nof a gentleman's pride, responded with a mounting color easy enough to\ninterpret.\n\n\"This, perhaps, is the first money your works have brought you?\" said\nAdeline.\n\n\"Yes, madame--my works of art. It is not the first-fruits of my labor,\nfor I have been a workman.\"\n\n\"Well, we must hope my daughter's money will bring you good luck,\" said\nshe.\n\n\"And take it without scruple,\" added the Baron, seeing that Wenceslas\nheld the purse in his hand instead of pocketing it. \"The sum will\nbe repaid by some rich man, a prince perhaps, who will offer it with\ninterest to possess so fine a work.\"\n\n\"Oh, I want it too much myself, papa, to give it up to anybody in the\nworld, even a royal prince!\"\n\n\"I can make a far prettier thing than that for you, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"But it would not be this one,\" replied she; and then, as if ashamed of\nhaving said too much, she ran out into the garden.\n\n\"Then I shall break the mould and the model as soon as I go home,\" said\nSteinbock.\n\n\"Fetch me your papers, and you will hear of me before long, if you are\nequal to what I expect of you, monsieur.\"\n\nThe artist on this could but take leave. After bowing to Madame Hulot\nand Hortense, who came in from the garden on purpose, he went off to\nwalk in the Tuileries, not bearing--not daring--to return to his attic,\nwhere his tyrant would pelt him with questions and wring his secret from\nhim.\n\nHortense's adorer conceived of groups and statues by the hundred; he\nfelt strong enough to hew the marble himself, like Canova, who was also\na feeble man, and nearly died of it. He was transfigured by Hortense,\nwho was to him inspiration made visible.\n\n\"Now then,\" said the Baroness to her daughter, \"what does all this\nmean?\"\n\n\"Well, dear mamma, you have just seen Cousin Lisbeth's lover, who now, I\nhope, is mine. But shut your eyes, know nothing. Good Heavens! I was to\nkeep it all from you, and I cannot help telling you everything----\"\n\n\"Good-bye, children!\" said the Baron, kissing his wife and daughter; \"I\nshall perhaps go to call on the Nanny, and from her I shall hear a great\ndeal about our young man.\"\n\n\"Papa, be cautious!\" said Hortense.\n\n\"Oh! little girl!\" cried the Baroness when Hortense had poured out her\npoem, of which the morning's adventure was the last canto, \"dear little\ngirl, Artlessness will always be the artfulest puss on earth!\"\n\nGenuine passions have an unerring instinct. Set a greedy man before a\ndish of fruit and he will make no mistake, but take the choicest even\nwithout seeing it. In the same way, if you allow a girl who is well\nbrought up to choose a husband for herself, if she is in a position to\nmeet the man of her heart, rarely will she blunder. The act of nature in\nsuch cases is known as love at first sight; and in love, first sight is\npractically second sight.\n\nThe Baroness' satisfaction, though disguised under maternal dignity, was\nas great as her daughter's; for, of the three ways of marrying Hortense\nof which Crevel had spoken, the best, as she opined, was about to be\nrealized. And she regarded this little drama as an answer by Providence\nto her fervent prayers.\n\n\n\nMademoiselle Fischer's galley slave, obliged at last to go home, thought\nhe might hide his joy as a lover under his glee as an artist rejoicing\nover his first success.\n\n\"Victory! my group is sold to the Duc d'Herouville, who is going to give\nme some commissions,\" cried he, throwing the twelve hundred francs in\ngold on the table before the old maid.\n\nHe had, as may be supposed concealed Hortense's purse; it lay next to\nhis heart.\n\n\"And a very good thing too,\" said Lisbeth. \"I was working myself to\ndeath. You see, child, money comes in slowly in the business you have\ntaken up, for this is the first you have earned, and you have been\ngrinding at it for near on five years now. That money barely repays me\nfor what you have cost me since I took your promissory note; that is\nall I have got by my savings. But be sure of one thing,\" she said, after\ncounting the gold, \"this money will all be spent on you. There is enough\nthere to keep us going for a year. In a year you may now be able to pay\nyour debt and have a snug little sum of your own, if you go on in the\nsame way.\"\n\nWenceslas, finding his trick successful, expatiated on the Duc\nd'Herouville.\n\n\"I will fit you out in a black suit, and get you some new linen,\" said\nLisbeth, \"for you must appear presentably before your patrons; and then\nyou must have a larger and better apartment than your horrible garret,\nand furnish it property.--You look so bright, you are not like the same\ncreature,\" she added, gazing at Wenceslas.\n\n\"But my work is pronounced a masterpiece.\"\n\n\"Well, so much the better! Do some more,\" said the arid creature, who\nwas nothing but practical, and incapable of understanding the joy of\ntriumph or of beauty in Art. \"Trouble your head no further about what\nyou have sold; make something else to sell. You have spent two hundred\nfrancs in money, to say nothing of your time and your labor, on that\ndevil of a _Samson_. Your clock will cost you more than two thousand\nfrancs to execute. I tell you what, if you will listen to me, you will\nfinish the two little boys crowning the little girl with cornflowers;\nthat would just suit the Parisians.--I will go round to Monsieur Graff\nthe tailor before going to Monsieur Crevel.--Go up now and leave me to\ndress.\"\n\nNext day the Baron, perfectly crazy about Madame Marneffe, went to see\nCousin Betty, who was considerably amazed on opening the door to see who\nher visitor was, for he had never called on her before. She at once said\nto herself, \"Can it be that Hortense wants my lover?\"--for she had heard\nthe evening before, at Monsieur Crevel's, that the marriage with the\nCouncillor of the Supreme Court was broken off.\n\n\"What, Cousin! you here? This is the first time you have ever been to\nsee me, and it is certainly not for love of my fine eyes that you have\ncome now.\"\n\n\"Fine eyes is the truth,\" said the Baron; \"you have as fine eyes as I\nhave ever seen----\"\n\n\"Come, what are you here for? I really am ashamed to receive you in such\na kennel.\"\n\nThe outer room of the two inhabited by Lisbeth served her as\nsitting-room, dining-room, kitchen, and workroom. The furniture was such\nas beseemed a well-to-do artisan--walnut-wood chairs with straw seats,\na small walnut-wood dining table, a work table, some colored prints in\nblack wooden frames, short muslin curtains to the windows, the floor\nwell polished and shining with cleanliness, not a speck of dust\nanywhere, but all cold and dingy, like a picture by Terburg in every\nparticular, even to the gray tone given by a wall paper once blue and\nnow faded to gray. As to the bedroom, no human being had ever penetrated\nits secrets.\n\nThe Baron took it all in at a glance, saw the sign-manual of commonness\non every detail, from the cast-iron stove to the household utensils, and\nhis gorge rose as he said to himself, \"And _this_ is virtue!--What am I\nhere for?\" said he aloud. \"You are far too cunning not to guess, and\nI had better tell you plainly,\" cried he, sitting down and looking out\nacross the courtyard through an opening he made in the puckered curtain.\n\"There is a very pretty woman in the house----\"\n\n\"Madame Marneffe! Now I understand!\" she exclaimed, seeing it all. \"But\nJosepha?\"\n\n\"Alas, Cousin, Josepha is no more. I was turned out of doors like a\ndiscarded footman.\"\n\n\"And you would like...?\" said Lisbeth, looking at the Baron with the\ndignity of a prude on her guard a quarter of an hour too soon.\n\n\"As Madame Marneffe is very much the lady, and the wife of an employe,\nyou can meet her without compromising yourself,\" the Baron went on, \"and\nI should like to see you neighborly. Oh! you need not be alarmed; she\nwill have the greatest consideration for the cousin of her husband's\nchief.\"\n\nAt this moment the rustle of a gown was heard on the stairs and the\nfootstep of a woman wearing the thinnest boots. The sound ceased on the\nlanding. There was a tap at the door, and Madame Marneffe came in.\n\n\"Pray excuse me, mademoiselle, for thus intruding upon you, but I failed\nto find you yesterday when I came to call; we are near neighbors; and\nif I had known that you were related to Monsieur le Baron, I should long\nsince have craved your kind interest with him. I saw him come in, so I\ntook the liberty of coming across; for my husband, Monsieur le Baron,\nspoke to me of a report on the office clerks which is to be laid before\nthe minister to-morrow.\"\n\nShe seemed quite agitated and nervous--but she had only run upstairs.\n\n\"You have no need to play the petitioner, fair lady,\" replied the Baron.\n\"It is I who should ask the favor of seeing you.\"\n\n\"Very well, if mademoiselle allows it, pray come!\" said Madame Marneffe.\n\n\"Yes--go, Cousin, I will join you,\" said Lisbeth judiciously.\n\nThe Parisienne had so confidently counted on the chief's visit and\nintelligence, that not only had she dressed herself for so important\nan interview--she had dressed her room. Early in the day it had been\nfurnished with flowers purchased on credit. Marneffe had helped his\nwife to polish the furniture, down to the smallest objects, washing,\nbrushing, and dusting everything. Valerie wished to be found in an\natmosphere of sweetness, to attract the chief and to please him enough\nto have a right to be cruel; to tantalize him as a child would, with all\nthe tricks of fashionable tactics. She had gauged Hulot. Give a Paris\nwoman at bay four-and-twenty hours, and she will overthrow a ministry.\n\nThe man of the Empire, accustomed to the ways to the Empire, was no\ndoubt quite ignorant of the ways of modern love-making, of the scruples\nin vogue and the various styles of conversation invented since 1830,\nwhich led to the poor weak woman being regarded as the victim of\nher lover's desires--a Sister of Charity salving a wound, an angel\nsacrificing herself.\n\nThis modern art of love uses a vast amount of evangelical phrases in the\nservice of the Devil. Passion is martyrdom. Both parties aspire to the\nIdeal, to the Infinite; love is to make them so much better. All these\nfine words are but a pretext for putting increased ardor into the\npractical side of it, more frenzy into a fall than of old. This\nhypocrisy, a characteristic of the times, is a gangrene in gallantry.\nThe lovers are both angels, and they behave, if they can, like two\ndevils.\n\nLove had no time for such subtle analysis between two campaigns, and in\n1809 its successes were as rapid as those of the Empire. So, under the\nRestoration, the handsome Baron, a lady's man once more, had begun by\nconsoling some old friends now fallen from the political firmament,\nlike extinguished stars, and then, as he grew old, was captured by Jenny\nCadine and Josepha.\n\nMadame Marneffe had placed her batteries after due study of the Baron's\npast life, which her husband had narrated in much detail, after picking\nup some information in the offices. The comedy of modern sentiment might\nhave the charm of novelty to the Baron; Valerie had made up her mind as\nto her scheme; and we may say the trial of her power that she made this\nmorning answered her highest expectations. Thanks to her manoeuvres,\nsentimental, high-flown, and romantic, Valerie, without committing\nherself to any promises, obtained for her husband the appointment as\ndeputy head of the office and the Cross of the Legion of Honor.\n\nThe campaign was not carried out without little dinners at the _Rocher\nde Cancale_, parties to the play, and gifts in the form of lace,\nscarves, gowns, and jewelry. The apartment in the Rue du Doyenne was not\nsatisfactory; the Baron proposed to furnish another magnificently in a\ncharming new house in the Rue Vanneau.\n\nMonsieur Marneffe got a fortnight's leave, to be taken a month hence\nfor urgent private affairs in the country, and a present in money;\nhe promised himself that he would spend both in a little town in\nSwitzerland, studying the fair sex.\n\nWhile Monsieur Hulot thus devoted himself to the lady he was\n\"protecting,\" he did not forget the young artist. Comte Popinot,\nMinister of Commerce, was a patron of Art; he paid two thousand francs\nfor a copy of the _Samson_ on condition that the mould should be broken,\nand that there should be no _Samson_ but his and Mademoiselle Hulot's.\nThe group was admired by a Prince, to whom the model sketch for the\nclock was also shown, and who ordered it; but that again was to be\nunique, and he offered thirty thousand francs for it.\n\nArtists who were consulted, and among them Stidmann, were of opinion\nthat the man who had sketched those two models was capable of achieving\na statue. The Marshal Prince de Wissembourg, Minister of War, and\nPresident of the Committee for the subscriptions to the monument of\nMarshal Montcornet, called a meeting, at which it was decided that the\nexecution of the work should be placed in Steinbock's hands. The Comte\nde Rastignac, at that time Under-secretary of State, wished to possess a\nwork by the artist, whose glory was waxing amid the acclamations of\nhis rivals. Steinbock sold to him the charming group of two little boys\ncrowning a little girl, and he promised to secure for the sculptor a\nstudio attached to the Government marble-quarries, situated, as all the\nworld knows, at Le Gros-Caillou.\n\nThis was a success, such success as is won in Paris, that is to say,\nstupendous success, that crushes those whose shoulders and loins are not\nstrong enough to bear it--as, be it said, not unfrequently is the case.\nCount Wenceslas Steinbock was written about in all the newspapers and\nreviews without his having the least suspicion of it, any more than\nhad Mademoiselle Fischer. Every day, as soon as Lisbeth had gone out to\ndinner, Wenceslas went to the Baroness' and spent an hour or two there,\nexcepting on the evenings when Lisbeth dined with the Hulots.\n\n\n\nThis state of things lasted for several days.\n\nThe Baron, assured of Count Steinbock's titles and position; the\nBaroness, pleased with his character and habits; Hortense, proud of her\npermitted love and of her suitor's fame, none of them hesitated to speak\nof the marriage; in short, the artist was in the seventh heaven, when an\nindiscretion on Madame Marneffe's part spoilt all.\n\nAnd this was how.\n\nLisbeth, whom the Baron wished to see intimate with Madame Marneffe,\nthat she might keep an eye on the couple, had already dined with\nValerie; and she, on her part, anxious to have an ear in the Hulot\nhouse, made much of the old maid. It occurred to Valerie to invite\nMademoiselle Fischer to a house-warming in the new apartments she was\nabout to move into. Lisbeth, glad to have found another house to\ndine in, and bewitched by Madame Marneffe, had taken a great fancy to\nValerie. Of all the persons she had made acquaintance with, no one had\ntaken so much pains to please her. In fact, Madame Marneffe, full of\nattentions for Mademoiselle Fischer, found herself in the position\ntowards Lisbeth that Lisbeth held towards the Baroness, Monsieur Rivet,\nCrevel, and the others who invited her to dinner.\n\nThe Marneffes had excited Lisbeth's compassion by allowing her to see\nthe extreme poverty of the house, while varnishing it as usual with\nthe fairest colors; their friends were under obligations to them and\nungrateful; they had had much illness; Madame Fortin, her mother, had\nnever known of their distress, and had died believing herself wealthy to\nthe end, thanks to their superhuman efforts--and so forth.\n\n\"Poor people!\" said she to her Cousin Hulot, \"you are right to do what\nyou can for them; they are so brave and so kind! They can hardly live on\nthe thousand crowns he gets as deputy-head of the office, for they have\ngot into debt since Marshal Montcornet's death. It is barbarity on the\npart of the Government to suppose that a clerk with a wife and family\ncan live in Paris on two thousand four hundred francs a year.\"\n\nAnd so, within a very short time, a young woman who affected regard for\nher, who told her everything, and consulted her, who flattered her,\nand seemed ready to yield to her guidance, had become dearer to the\neccentric Cousin Lisbeth than all her relations.\n\nThe Baron, on his part, admiring in Madame Marneffe such propriety,\neducation, and breeding as neither Jenny Cadine nor Josepha, nor any\nfriend of theirs had to show, had fallen in love with her in a\nmonth, developing a senile passion, a senseless passion, which had an\nappearance of reason. In fact, he found here neither the banter, nor the\norgies, nor the reckless expenditure, nor the depravity, nor the scorn\nof social decencies, nor the insolent independence which had brought him\nto grief alike with the actress and the singer. He was spared, too, the\nrapacity of the courtesan, like unto the thirst of dry sand.\n\nMadame Marneffe, of whom he had made a friend and confidante, made the\ngreatest difficulties over accepting any gift from him.\n\n\"Appointments, official presents, anything you can extract from the\nGovernment; but do not begin by insulting a woman whom you profess to\nlove,\" said Valerie. \"If you do, I shall cease to believe you--and\nI like to believe you,\" she added, with a glance like Saint Theresa\nleering at heaven.\n\nEvery time he made her a present there was a fortress to be stormed, a\nconscience to be over-persuaded. The hapless Baron laid deep stratagems\nto offer her some trifle--costly, nevertheless--proud of having at last\nmet with virtue and the realization of his dreams. In this primitive\nhousehold, as he assured himself, he was the god as much as in his own.\nAnd Monsieur Marneffe seemed at a thousand leagues from suspecting that\nthe Jupiter of his office intended to descend on his wife in a shower of\ngold; he was his august chief's humblest slave.\n\nMadame Marneffe, twenty-three years of age, a pure and bashful\nmiddle-class wife, a blossom hidden in the Rue du Doyenne, could know\nnothing of the depravity and demoralizing harlotry which the Baron could\nno longer think of without disgust, for he had never known the charm\nof recalcitrant virtue, and the coy Valerie made him enjoy it to the\nutmost--all along the line, as the saying goes.\n\nThe question having come to this point between Hector and Valerie, it is\nnot astonishing that Valerie should have heard from Hector the secret of\nthe intended marriage between the great sculptor Steinbock and Hortense\nHulot. Between a lover on his promotion and a lady who hesitates\nlong before becoming his mistress, there are contests, uttered or\nunexpressed, in which a word often betrays a thought; as, in fencing,\nthe foils fly as briskly as the swords in duel. Then a prudent man\nfollows the example of Monsieur de Turenne. Thus the Baron had hinted at\nthe greater freedom his daughter's marriage would allow him, in reply to\nthe tender Valerie, who more than once had exclaimed:\n\n\"I cannot imagine how a woman can go wrong for a man who is not wholly\nhers.\"\n\nAnd a thousand times already the Baron had declared that for\nfive-and-twenty years all had been at an end between Madame Hulot and\nhimself.\n\n\"And they say she is so handsome!\" replied Madame Marneffe. \"I want\nproof.\"\n\n\"You shall have it,\" said the Baron, made happy by this demand, by which\nhis Valerie committed herself.\n\nHector had then been compelled to reveal his plans, already being\ncarried into effect in the Rue Vanneau, to prove to Valerie that he\nintended to devote to her that half of his life which belonged to his\nlawful wife, supposing that day and night equally divide the existence\nof civilized humanity. He spoke of decently deserting his wife, leaving\nher to herself as soon as Hortense should be married. The Baroness would\nthen spend all her time with Hortense or the young Hulot couple; he was\nsure of her submission.\n\n\"And then, my angel, my true life, my real home will be in the Rue\nVanneau.\"\n\n\"Bless me, how you dispose of me!\" said Madame Marneffe. \"And my\nhusband----\"\n\n\"That rag!\"\n\n\"To be sure, as compared with you so he is!\" said she with a laugh.\n\nMadame Marneffe, having heard Steinbock's history, was frantically eager\nto see the young Count; perhaps she wished to have some trifle of his\nwork while they still lived under the same roof. This curiosity so\nseriously annoyed the Baron that Valerie swore to him that she would\nnever even look at Wenceslas. But though she obtained, as the reward\nof her surrender of this wish, a little tea-service of old Sevres _pate\ntendre_, she kept her wish at the bottom of her heart, as if written on\ntablets.\n\nSo one day when she had begged \"_my_ Cousin Betty\" to come to take\ncoffee with her in her room, she opened on the subject of her lover, to\nknow how she might see him without risk.\n\n\"My dear child,\" said she, for they called each my dear, \"why have you\nnever introduced your lover to me? Do you know that within a short time\nhe has become famous?\"\n\n\"He famous?\"\n\n\"He is the one subject of conversation.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" cried Lisbeth.\n\n\"He is going to execute the statue of my father, and I could be of great\nuse to him and help him to succeed in the work; for Madame Montcornet\ncannot lend him, as I can, a miniature by Sain, a beautiful thing\ndone in 1809, before the Wagram Campaign, and given to my poor\nmother--Montcornet when he was young and handsome.\"\n\nSain and Augustin between them held the sceptre of miniature painting\nunder the Empire.\n\n\"He is going to make a statue, my dear, did you say?\"\n\n\"Nine feet high--by the orders of the Minister of War. Why, where have\nyou dropped from that I should tell you the news? Why, the Government is\ngoing to give Count Steinbock rooms and a studio at Le Gros-Caillou,\nthe depot for marble; your Pole will be made the Director, I should not\nwonder, with two thousand francs a year and a ring on his finger.\"\n\n\"How do you know all this when I have heard nothing about it?\" said\nLisbeth at last, shaking off her amazement.\n\n\"Now, my dear little Cousin Betty,\" said Madame Marneffe, in an\ninsinuating voice, \"are you capable of devoted friendship, put to any\ntest? Shall we henceforth be sisters? Will you swear to me never to have\na secret from me any more than I from you--to act as my spy, as I will\nbe yours?--Above all, will you pledge yourself never to betray me either\nto my husband or to Monsieur Hulot, and never reveal that it was I who\ntold you----?\"\n\nMadame Marneffe broke off in this spurring harangue; Lisbeth frightened\nher. The peasant-woman's face was terrible; her piercing black eyes\nhad the glare of the tiger's; her face was like that we ascribe to a\npythoness; she set her teeth to keep them from chattering, and her whole\nframe quivered convulsively. She had pushed her clenched fingers under\nher cap to clutch her hair and support her head, which felt too heavy;\nshe was on fire. The smoke of the flame that scorched her seemed to\nemanate from her wrinkles as from the crevasses rent by a volcanic\neruption. It was a startling spectacle.\n\n\"Well, why do you stop?\" she asked in a hollow voice. \"I will be all to\nyou that I have been to him.--Oh, I would have given him my life-blood!\"\n\n\"You loved him then?\"\n\n\"Like a child of my own!\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Madame Marneffe, with a breath of relief, \"if you\nonly love him in that way, you will be very happy--for you wish him to\nbe happy?\"\n\nLisbeth replied by a nod as hasty as a madwoman's.\n\n\"He is to marry your Cousin Hortense in a month's time.\"\n\n\"Hortense!\" shrieked the old maid, striking her forehead, and starting\nto her feet.\n\n\"Well, but then you were really in love with this young man?\" asked\nValerie.\n\n\"My dear, we are bound for life and death, you and I,\" said Mademoiselle\nFischer. \"Yes, if you have any love affairs, to me they are sacred. Your\nvices will be virtues in my eyes.--For I shall need your vices!\"\n\n\"Then did you live with him?\" asked Valerie.\n\n\"No; I meant to be a mother to him.\"\n\n\"I give it up. I cannot understand,\" said Valerie. \"In that case you are\nneither betrayed nor cheated, and you ought to be very happy to see him\nso well married; he is now fairly afloat. And, at any rate, your day is\nover. Our artist goes to Madame Hulot's every evening as soon as you go\nout to dinner.\"\n\n\"Adeline!\" muttered Lisbeth. \"Oh, Adeline, you shall pay for this! I\nwill make you uglier than I am.\"\n\n\"You are as pale as death!\" exclaimed Valerie. \"There is something\nwrong?--Oh, what a fool I am! The mother and daughter must have\nsuspected that you would raise some obstacles in the way of this affair\nsince they have kept it from you,\" said Madame Marneffe. \"But if you did\nnot live with the young man, my dear, all this is a greater puzzle to me\nthan my husband's feelings----\"\n\n\"Ah, you don't know,\" said Lisbeth; \"you have no idea of all their\ntricks. It is the last blow that kills. And how many such blows have I\nhad to bruise my soul! You don't know that from the time when I could\nfirst feel, I have been victimized for Adeline. I was beaten, and she\nwas petted; I was dressed like a scullion, and she had clothes like a\nlady's; I dug in the garden and cleaned the vegetables, and she--she\nnever lifted a finger for anything but to make up some finery!--She\nmarried the Baron, she came to shine at the Emperor's Court, while I\nstayed in our village till 1809, waiting for four years for a suitable\nmatch; they brought me away, to be sure, but only to make me a\nwork-woman, and to offer me clerks or captains like coalheavers for a\nhusband! I have had their leavings for twenty-six years!--And now like\nthe story in the Old Testament, the poor relation has one ewe-lamb which\nis all her joy, and the rich man who has flocks covets the ewe-lamb and\nsteals it--without warning, without asking. Adeline has meanly robbed me\nof my happiness!--Adeline! Adeline! I will see you in the mire, and sunk\nlower than myself!--And Hortense--I loved her, and she has cheated me.\nThe Baron.--No, it is impossible. Tell me again what is really true of\nall this.\"\n\n\"Be calm, my dear child.\"\n\n\"Valerie, my darling, I will be calm,\" said the strange creature,\nsitting down again. \"One thing only can restore me to reason; give me\nproofs.\"\n\n\"Your Cousin Hortense has the _Samson_ group--here is a lithograph from\nit published in a review. She paid for it out of her pocket-money, and\nit is the Baron who, to benefit his future son-in-law, is pushing him,\ngetting everything for him.\"\n\n\"Water!--water!\" said Lisbeth, after glancing at the print, below which\nshe read, \"A group belonging to Mademoiselle Hulot d'Ervy.\" \"Water! my\nhead is burning, I am going mad!\"\n\nMadame Marneffe fetched some water. Lisbeth took off her cap, unfastened\nher black hair, and plunged her head into the basin her new friend held\nfor her. She dipped her forehead into it several times, and checked the\nincipient inflammation. After this douche she completely recovered her\nself-command.\n\n\"Not a word,\" said she to Madame Marneffe as she wiped her face--\"not a\nword of all this.--You see, I am quite calm; everything is forgotten. I\nam thinking of something very different.\"\n\n\"She will be in Charenton to-morrow, that is very certain,\" thought\nMadame Marneffe, looking at the old maid.\n\n\"What is to be done?\" Lisbeth went on. \"You see, my angel, there is\nnothing for it but to hold my tongue, bow my head, and drift to the\ngrave, as all water runs to the river. What could I try to do? I should\nlike to grind them all--Adeline, her daughter, and the Baron--all to\ndust! But what can a poor relation do against a rich family? It would be\nthe story of the earthen pot and the iron pot.\"\n\n\"Yes; you are right,\" said Valerie. \"You can only pull as much hay as\nyou can to your side of the manger. That is all the upshot of life in\nParis.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" said Lisbeth, \"I shall soon die, I can tell you, if I lose\nthat boy to whom I fancied I could always be a mother, and with whom I\ncounted on living all my days----\"\n\nThere were tears in her eyes, and she paused. Such emotion in this woman\nmade of sulphur and flame, made Valerie shudder.\n\n\"Well, at any rate, I have found you,\" said Lisbeth, taking Valerie's\nhand, \"that is some consolation in this dreadful trouble.--We shall\nbe true friends; and why should we ever part? I shall never cross\nyour track. No one will ever be in love with me!--Those who would\nhave married me, would only have done it to secure my Cousin Hulot's\ninterest. With energy enough to scale Paradise, to have to devote it to\nprocuring bread and water, a few rags, and a garret!--That is martyrdom,\nmy dear, and I have withered under it.\"\n\nShe broke off suddenly, and shot a black flash into Madame Marneffe's\nblue eyes, a glance that pierced the pretty woman's soul, as the point\nof a dagger might have pierced her heart.\n\n\"And what is the use of talking?\" she exclaimed in reproof to herself.\n\"I never said so much before, believe me! The tables will be turned\nyet!\" she added after a pause. \"As you so wisely say, let us sharpen our\nteeth, and pull down all the hay we can get.\"\n\n\"You are very wise,\" said Madame Marneffe, who had been frightened by\nthis scene, and had no remembrance of having uttered this maxim. \"I am\nsure you are right, my dear child. Life is not so long after all, and\nwe must make the best of it, and make use of others to contribute to our\nenjoyment. Even I have learned that, young as I am. I was brought up a\nspoilt child, my father married ambitiously, and almost forgot me, after\nmaking me his idol and bringing me up like a queen's daughter! My poor\nmother, who filled my head with splendid visions, died of grief at\nseeing me married to an office clerk with twelve hundred francs a year,\nat nine-and-thirty an aged and hardened libertine, as corrupt as\nthe hulks, looking on me, as others looked on you, as a means of\nfortune!--Well, in that wretched man, I have found the best of husbands.\nHe prefers the squalid sluts he picks up at the street corners, and\nleaves me free. Though he keeps all his salary to himself, he never asks\nme where I get money to live on----\"\n\nAnd she in her turn stopped short, as a woman does who feels herself\ncarried away by the torrent of her confessions; struck, too, by\nLisbeth's eager attention, she thought well to make sure of Lisbeth\nbefore revealing her last secrets.\n\n\"You see, dear child, how entire is my confidence in you!\" she presently\nadded, to which Lisbeth replied by a most comforting nod.\n\nAn oath may be taken by a look and a nod more solemnly than in a court\nof justice.\n\n\"I keep up every appearance of respectability,\" Valerie went on, laying\nher hand on Lisbeth's as if to accept her pledge. \"I am a married\nwoman, and my own mistress, to such a degree, that in the morning, when\nMarneffe sets out for the office, if he takes it into his head to say\ngood-bye and finds my door locked, he goes off without a word. He cares\nless for his boy than I care for one of the marble children that play\nat the feet of one of the river-gods in the Tuileries. If I do not come\nhome to dinner, he dines quite contentedly with the maid, for the maid\nis devoted to monsieur; and he goes out every evening after dinner, and\ndoes not come in till twelve or one o'clock. Unfortunately, for a year\npast, I have had no ladies' maid, which is as much as to say that I am a\nwidow!\n\n\"I have had one passion, once have been happy--a rich Brazilian--who\nwent away a year ago--my only lapse!--He went away to sell his estates,\nto realize his land, and come back to live in France. What will he find\nleft of his Valerie? A dunghill. Well! it is his fault and not mine;\nwhy does he delay coming so long? Perhaps he has been wrecked--like my\nvirtue.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, my dear,\" said Lisbeth abruptly; \"we are friends for ever. I\nlove you, I esteem you, I am wholly yours! My cousin is tormenting me\nto go and live in the house you are moving to, in the Rue Vanneau; but\nI would not go, for I saw at once the reasons for this fresh piece of\nkindness----\"\n\n\"Yes; you would have kept an eye on me, I know!\" said Madame Marneffe.\n\n\"That was, no doubt, the motive of his generosity,\" replied Lisbeth. \"In\nParis, most beneficence is a speculation, as most acts of ingratitude\nare revenge! To a poor relation you behave as you do to rats to whom\nyou offer a bit of bacon. Now, I will accept the Baron's offer, for this\nhouse has grown intolerable to me. You and I have wit enough to hold our\ntongues about everything that would damage us, and tell all that needs\ntelling. So, no blabbing--and we are friends.\"\n\n\"Through thick and thin!\" cried Madame Marneffe, delighted to have a\nsheep-dog, a confidante, a sort of respectable aunt. \"Listen to me; the\nBaron is doing a great deal in the Rue Vanneau----\"\n\n\"I believe you!\" interrupted Lisbeth. \"He has spent thirty thousand\nfrancs! Where he got the money, I am sure I don't know, for Josepha\nthe singer bled him dry.--Oh! you are in luck,\" she went on. \"The Baron\nwould steal for a woman who held his heart in two little white satin\nhands like yours!\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Madame Marneffe, with the liberality of such\ncreatures, which is mere recklessness, \"look here, my dear child;\ntake away from here everything that may serve your turn in your new\nquarters--that chest of drawers, that wardrobe and mirror, the carpet,\nthe curtains----\"\n\nLisbeth's eyes dilated with excessive joy; she was incredulous of such a\ngift.\n\n\"You are doing more for me in a breath than my rich relations have done\nin thirty years!\" she exclaimed. \"They have never even asked themselves\nwhether I had any furniture at all. On his first visit, a few weeks ago,\nthe Baron made a rich man's face on seeing how poor I was.--Thank you,\nmy dear; and I will give you your money's worth, you will see how by and\nby.\"\n\nValerie went out on the landing with _her_ Cousin Betty, and the two\nwomen embraced.\n\n\"Pouh! How she stinks of hard work!\" said the pretty little woman to\nherself when she was alone. \"I shall not embrace you often, my dear\ncousin! At the same time, I must look sharp. She must be skilfully\nmanaged, for she can be of use, and help me to make my fortune.\"\n\n\n\nLike the true Creole of Paris, Madame Marneffe abhorred trouble; she had\nthe calm indifference of a cat, which never jumps or runs but when\nurged by necessity. To her, life must be all pleasure; and the pleasure\nwithout difficulties. She loved flowers, provided they were brought to\nher. She could not imagine going to the play but to a good box, at her\nown command, and in a carriage to take her there. Valerie inherited\nthese courtesan tastes from her mother, on whom General Montcornet had\nlavished luxury when he was in Paris, and who for twenty years had\nseen all the world at her feet; who had been wasteful and prodigal,\nsquandering her all in the luxurious living of which the programme has\nbeen lost since the fall of Napoleon.\n\nThe grandees of the Empire were a match in their follies for the great\nnobles of the last century. Under the Restoration the nobility cannot\nforget that it has been beaten and robbed, and so, with two or three\nexceptions, it has become thrifty, prudent, and stay-at-home, in short,\nbourgeois and penurious. Since then, 1830 has crowned the work of 1793.\nIn France, henceforth, there will be great names, but no great houses,\nunless there should be political changes which we can hardly foresee.\nEverything takes the stamp of individuality. The wisest invest in\nannuities. Family pride is destroyed.\n\nThe bitter pressure of poverty which had stung Valerie to the quick on\nthe day when, to use Marneffe's expression, she had \"caught on\" with\nHulot, had brought the young woman to the conclusion that she would make\na fortune by means of her good looks. So, for some days, she had been\nfeeling the need of having a friend about her to take the place of a\nmother--a devoted friend, to whom such things may be told as must be\nhidden from a waiting-maid, and who could act, come and go, and think\nfor her, a beast of burden resigned to an unequal share of life. Now,\nshe, quite as keenly as Lisbeth, had understood the Baron's motives for\nfostering the intimacy between his cousin and herself.\n\nPrompted by the formidable perspicacity of the Parisian half-breed,\nwho spends her days stretched on a sofa, turning the lantern of her\ndetective spirit on the obscurest depths of souls, sentiments, and\nintrigues, she had decided on making an ally of the spy. This supremely\nrash step was, perhaps premeditated; she had discerned the true nature\nof this ardent creature, burning with wasted passion, and meant to\nattach her to herself. Thus, their conversation was like the stone\na traveler casts into an abyss to demonstrate its depth. And Madame\nMarneffe had been terrified to find this old maid a combination of Iago\nand Richard III., so feeble as she seemed, so humble, and so little to\nbe feared.\n\nFor that instant, Lisbeth Fischer had been her real self; that Corsican\nand savage temperament, bursting the slender bonds that held it under,\nhad sprung up to its terrible height, as the branch of a tree flies\nup from the hand of a child that has bent it down to gather the green\nfruit.\n\nTo those who study the social world, it must always be a matter of\nastonishment to see the fulness, the perfection, and the rapidity with\nwhich an idea develops in a virgin nature.\n\nVirginity, like every other monstrosity, has its special richness, its\nabsorbing greatness. Life, whose forces are always economized,\nassumes in the virgin creature an incalculable power of resistance and\nendurance. The brain is reinforced in the sum-total of its reserved\nenergy. When really chaste natures need to call on the resources of\nbody or soul, and are required to act or to think, they have muscles\nof steel, or intuitive knowledge in their intelligence--diabolical\nstrength, or the black magic of the Will.\n\nFrom this point of view the Virgin Mary, even if we regard her only as\na symbol, is supremely great above every other type, whether Hindoo,\nEgyptian, or Greek. Virginity, the mother of great things, _magna parens\nrerum_, holds in her fair white hands the keys of the upper worlds. In\nshort, that grand and terrible exception deserves all the honors decreed\nto her by the Catholic Church.\n\nThus, in one moment, Lisbeth Fischer had become the Mohican whose\nsnares none can escape, whose dissimulation is inscrutable, whose swift\ndecisiveness is the outcome of the incredible perfection of every organ\nof sense. She was Hatred and Revenge, as implacable as they are\nin Italy, Spain, and the East. These two feelings, the obverse of\nfriendship and love carried to the utmost, are known only in lands\nscorched by the sun. But Lisbeth was also a daughter of Lorraine, bent\non deceit.\n\nShe accepted this detail of her part against her will; she began by\nmaking a curious attempt, due to her ignorance. She fancied, as children\ndo, that being imprisoned meant the same thing as solitary confinement.\nBut this is the superlative degree of imprisonment, and that superlative\nis the privilege of the Criminal Bench.\n\nAs soon as she left Madame Marneffe, Lisbeth hurried off to Monsieur\nRivet, and found him in his office.\n\n\"Well, my dear Monsieur Rivet,\" she began, when she had bolted the\ndoor of the room. \"You were quite right. Those Poles! They are low\nvillains--all alike, men who know neither law nor fidelity.\"\n\n\"And who want to set Europe on fire,\" said the peaceable Rivet, \"to\nruin every trade and every trader for the sake of a country that is all\nbog-land, they say, and full of horrible Jews, to say nothing of the\nCossacks and the peasants--a sort of wild beasts classed by mistake with\nhuman beings. Your Poles do not understand the times we live in; we are\nno longer barbarians. War is coming to an end, my dear mademoiselle; it\nwent out with the Monarchy. This is the age of triumph for commerce, and\nindustry, and middle-class prudence, such as were the making of Holland.\n\n\"Yes,\" he went on with animation, \"we live in a period when nations must\nobtain all they need by the legal extension of their liberties and by\nthe pacific action of Constitutional Institutions; that is what the\nPoles do not see, and I hope----\n\n\"You were saying, my dear?--\" he added, interrupting himself when he\nsaw from his work-woman's face that high politics were beyond her\ncomprehension.\n\n\"Here is the schedule,\" said Lisbeth. \"If I don't want to lose my\nthree thousand two hundred and ten francs, I must clap this rogue into\nprison.\"\n\n\"Didn't I tell you so?\" cried the oracle of the Saint-Denis quarter.\n\nThe Rivets, successor to Pons Brothers, had kept their shop still in the\nRue des Mauvaises-Paroles, in the ancient Hotel Langeais, built by that\nillustrious family at the time when the nobility still gathered round\nthe Louvre.\n\n\"Yes, and I blessed you on my way here,\" replied Lisbeth.\n\n\"If he suspects nothing, he can be safe in prison by eight o'clock in\nthe morning,\" said Rivet, consulting the almanac to ascertain the hour\nof sunrise; \"but not till the day after to-morrow, for he cannot be\nimprisoned till he has had notice that he is to be arrested by writ,\nwith the option of payment or imprisonment. And so----\"\n\n\"What an idiotic law!\" exclaimed Lisbeth. \"Of course the debtor\nescapes.\"\n\n\"He has every right to do so,\" said the Assessor, smiling. \"So this is\nthe way----\"\n\n\"As to that,\" said Lisbeth, interrupting him, \"I will take the paper and\nhand it to him, saying that I have been obliged to raise the money, and\nthat the lender insists on this formality. I know my gentleman. He will\nnot even look at the paper; he will light his pipe with it.\"\n\n\"Not a bad idea, not bad, Mademoiselle Fischer! Well, make your mind\neasy; the job shall be done.--But stop a minute; to put your man in\nprison is not the only point to be considered; you only want to indulge\nin that legal luxury in order to get your money. Who is to pay you?\"\n\n\"Those who give him money.\"\n\n\"To be sure; I forgot that the Minister of War had commissioned him\nto erect a monument to one of our late customers. Ah! the house has\nsupplied many an uniform to General Montcornet; he soon blackened them\nwith the smoke of cannon. A brave man, he was! and he paid on the nail.\"\n\nA marshal of France may have saved the Emperor or his country; \"He\npaid on the nail\" will always be the highest praise he can have from a\ntradesman.\n\n\"Very well. And on Saturday, Monsieur Rivet, you shall have the flat\ntassels.--By the way, I am moving from the Rue du Doyenne; I am going to\nlive in the Rue Vanneau.\"\n\n\"You are very right. I could not bear to see you in that hole which,\nin spite of my aversion to the Opposition, I must say is a disgrace; I\nrepeat it, yes! is a disgrace to the Louvre and the Place du Carrousel.\nI am devoted to Louis-Philippe, he is my idol; he is the august and\nexact representative of the class on whom he founded his dynasty, and\nI can never forget what he did for the trimming-makers by restoring the\nNational Guard----\"\n\n\"When I hear you speak so, Monsieur Rivet, I cannot help wondering why\nyou are not made a deputy.\"\n\n\"They are afraid of my attachment to the dynasty,\" replied Rivet. \"My\npolitical enemies are the King's. He has a noble character! They are\na fine family; in short,\" said he, returning to the charge, \"he is our\nideal: morality, economy, everything. But the completion of the Louvre\nis one of the conditions on which we gave him the crown, and the civil\nlist, which, I admit, had no limits set to it, leaves the heart of Paris\nin a most melancholy state.--It is because I am so strongly in favor\nof the middle course that I should like to see the middle of Paris in\na better condition. Your part of the town is positively terrifying.\nYou would have been murdered there one fine day.--And so your Monsieur\nCrevel has been made Major of his division! He will come to us, I hope,\nfor his big epaulette.\"\n\n\"I am dining with him to-night, and will send him to you.\"\n\nLisbeth believed that she had secured her Livonian to herself by cutting\nhim off from all communication with the outer world. If he could no\nlonger work, the artist would be forgotten as completely as a man buried\nin a cellar, where she alone would go to see him. Thus she had two\nhappy days, for she hoped to deal a mortal blow at the Baroness and her\ndaughter.\n\nTo go to Crevel's house, in the Rue des Saussayes, she crossed the Pont\ndu Carrousel, went along the Quai Voltaire, the Quai d'Orsay, the Rue\nBellechasse, Rue de l'Universite, the Pont de la Concorde, and the\nAvenue de Marigny. This illogical route was traced by the logic of\npassion, always the foe of the legs.\n\nCousin Betty, as long as she followed the line of the quays, kept watch\non the opposite shore of the Seine, walking very slowly. She had guessed\nrightly. She had left Wenceslas dressing; she at once understood that,\nas soon as he should be rid of her, the lover would go off to the\nBaroness' by the shortest road. And, in fact, as she wandered along by\nthe parapet of the Quai Voltaire, in fancy suppressing the river and\nwalking along the opposite bank, she recognized the artist as he came\nout of the Tuileries to cross the Pont Royal. She there came up with\nthe faithless one, and could follow him unseen, for lovers rarely look\nbehind them. She escorted him as far as Madame Hulot's house, where he\nwent in like an accustomed visitor.\n\nThis crowning proof, confirming Madame Marneffe's revelations, put\nLisbeth quite beside herself.\n\nShe arrived at the newly promoted Major's door in the state of mental\nirritation which prompts men to commit murder, and found Monsieur Crevel\n_senior_ in his drawing-room awaiting his children, Monsieur and Madame\nHulot _junior_.\n\nBut Celestin Crevel was so unconscious and so perfect a type of the\nParisian parvenu, that we can scarcely venture so unceremoniously into\nthe presence of Cesar Birotteau's successor. Celestin Crevel was a world\nin himself; and he, even more than Rivet, deserves the honors of the\npalette by reason of his importance in this domestic drama.\n\n\n\nHave you ever observed how in childhood, or at the early stages of\nsocial life, we create a model for our own imitation, with our own\nhands as it were, and often without knowing it? The banker's clerk, for\ninstance, as he enters his master's drawing-room, dreams of possessing\nsuch another. If he makes a fortune, it will not be the luxury of\nthe day, twenty years later, that you will find in his house, but the\nold-fashioned splendor that fascinated him of yore. It is impossible to\ntell how many absurdities are due to this retrospective jealousy; and\nin the same way we know nothing of the follies due to the covert rivalry\nthat urges men to copy the type they have set themselves, and exhaust\ntheir powers in shining with a reflected light, like the moon.\n\nCrevel was deputy mayor because his predecessor had been; he was Major\nbecause he coveted Cesar Birotteau's epaulettes. In the same way,\nstruck by the marvels wrought by Grindot the architect, at the time\nwhen Fortune had carried his master to the top of the wheel, Crevel had\n\"never looked at both sides of a crown-piece,\" to use his own language,\nwhen he wanted to \"do up\" his rooms; he had gone with his purse open and\nhis eyes shut to Grindot, who by this time was quite forgotten. It\nis impossible to guess how long an extinct reputation may survive,\nsupported by such stale admiration.\n\nSo Grindot, for the thousandth time had displayed his white-and-gold\ndrawing-room paneled with crimson damask. The furniture, of rosewood,\nclumsily carved, as such work is done for the trade, had in the country\nbeen the source of just pride in Paris workmanship on the occasion of\nan industrial exhibition. The candelabra, the fire-dogs, the fender,\nthe chandelier, the clock, were all in the most unmeaning style of\nscroll-work; the round table, a fixture in the middle of the room, was\na mosaic of fragments of Italian and antique marbles, brought from Rome,\nwhere these dissected maps are made of mineralogical specimens--for all\nthe world like tailors' patterns--an object of perennial admiration\nto Crevel's citizen friends. The portraits of the late lamented Madame\nCrevel, of Crevel himself, of his daughter and his son-in-law, hung\non the walls, two and two; they were the work of Pierre Grassou, the\nfavored painter of the bourgeoisie, to whom Crevel owed his ridiculous\nByronic attitude. The frames, costing a thousand francs each, were quite\nin harmony with this coffee-house magnificence, which would have made\nany true artist shrug his shoulders.\n\nMoney never yet missed the smallest opportunity of being stupid. We\nshould have in Paris ten Venices if our retired merchants had had the\ninstinct for fine things characteristic of the Italians. Even in our own\nday a Milanese merchant could leave five hundred thousand francs to\nthe Duomo, to regild the colossal statue of the Virgin that crowns the\nedifice. Canova, in his will, desired his brother to build a church\ncosting four million francs, and that brother adds something on his own\naccount. Would a citizen of Paris--and they all, like Rivet, love their\nParis in their heart--ever dream of building the spires that are lacking\nto the towers of Notre-Dame? And only think of the sums that revert to\nthe State in property for which no heirs are found.\n\nAll the improvements of Paris might have been completed with the money\nspent on stucco castings, gilt mouldings, and sham sculpture during the\nlast fifteen years by individuals of the Crevel stamp.\n\nBeyond this drawing-room was a splendid boudoir furnished with tables\nand cabinets in imitation of Boulle.\n\nThe bedroom, smart with chintz, also opened out of the drawing-room.\nMahogany in all its glory infested the dining-room, and Swiss views,\ngorgeously framed, graced the panels. Crevel, who hoped to travel in\nSwitzerland, had set his heart on possessing the scenery in painting\ntill the time should come when he might see it in reality.\n\nSo, as will have been seen, Crevel, the Mayor's deputy, of the Legion\nof Honor and of the National Guard, had faithfully reproduced all the\nmagnificence, even as to furniture, of his luckless predecessor. Under\nthe Restoration, where one had sunk, this other, quite overlooked, had\ncome to the top--not by any strange stroke of fortune, but by the force\nof circumstance. In revolutions, as in storms at sea, solid treasure\ngoes to the bottom, and light trifles are floated to the surface. Cesar\nBirotteau, a Royalist, in favor and envied, had been made the mark of\nbourgeois hostility, while bourgeoisie triumphant found its incarnation\nin Crevel.\n\nThis apartment, at a rent of a thousand crowns, crammed with all the\nvulgar magnificence that money can buy, occupied the first floor of\na fine old house between a courtyard and a garden. Everything was as\nspick-and-span as the beetles in an entomological case, for Crevel lived\nvery little at home.\n\nThis gorgeous residence was the ambitious citizen's legal domicile. His\nestablishment consisted of a woman-cook and a valet; he hired two extra\nmen, and had a dinner sent in by Chevet, whenever he gave a banquet to\nhis political friends, to men he wanted to dazzle or to a family party.\n\nThe seat of Crevel's real domesticity, formerly in the Rue Notre-Dame\nde Lorette, with Mademoiselle Heloise Brisetout, had lately been\ntransferred, as we have seen, to the Rue Chauchat. Every morning the\nretired merchant--every ex-tradesman is a retired merchant--spent two\nhours in the Rue des Saussayes to attend to business, and gave the\nrest of his time to Mademoiselle Zaire, which annoyed Zaire very much.\nOrosmanes-Crevel had a fixed bargain with Mademoiselle Heloise; she owed\nhim five hundred francs worth of enjoyment every month, and no \"bills\ndelivered.\" He paid separately for his dinner and all extras. This\nagreement, with certain bonuses, for he made her a good many presents,\nseemed cheap to the ex-attache of the great singer; and he would say to\nwidowers who were fond of their daughters, that it paid better to job\nyour horses than to have a stable of your own. At the same time, if the\nreader remembers the speech made to the Baron by the porter at the Rue\nChauchat, Crevel did not escape the coachman and the groom.\n\nCrevel, as may be seen, had turned his passionate affection for his\ndaughter to the advantage of his self-indulgence. The immoral aspect\nof the situation was justified by the highest morality. And then the\nex-perfumer derived from this style of living--it was the inevitable,\na free-and-easy life, _Regence, Pompadour, Marechal de Richelieu_, what\nnot--a certain veneer of superiority. Crevel set up for being a man of\nbroad views, a fine gentleman with an air and grace, a liberal man with\nnothing narrow in his ideas--and all for the small sum of about\ntwelve to fifteen hundred francs a month. This was the result not of\nhypocritical policy, but of middle-class vanity, though it came to the\nsame in the end.\n\nOn the Bourse Crevel was regarded as a man superior to his time, and\nespecially as a man of pleasure, a _bon vivant_. In this particular\nCrevel flattered himself that he had overtopped his worthy friend\nBirotteau by a hundred cubits.\n\n\"And is it you?\" cried Crevel, flying into a rage as he saw Lisbeth\nenter the room, \"who have plotted this marriage between Mademoiselle\nHulot and your young Count, whom you have been bringing up by hand for\nher?\"\n\n\"You don't seem best pleased at it?\" said Lisbeth, fixing a piercing\neye on Crevel. \"What interest can you have in hindering my cousin's\nmarriage? For it was you, I am told, who hindered her marrying Monsieur\nLebas' son.\"\n\n\"You are a good soul and to be trusted,\" said Crevel. \"Well, then, do\nyou suppose that I will ever forgive Monsieur Hulot for the crime of\nhaving robbed me of Josepha--especially when he turned a decent girl,\nwhom I should have married in my old age, into a good-for-nothing slut,\na mountebank, an opera singer!--No, no. Never!\"\n\n\"He is a very good fellow, too, is Monsieur Hulot,\" said Cousin Betty.\n\n\"Amiable, very amiable--too amiable,\" replied Crevel. \"I wish him no\nharm; but I do wish to have my revenge, and I will have it. It is my one\nidea.\"\n\n\"And is that desire the reason why you no longer visit Madame Hulot?\"\n\n\"Possibly.\"\n\n\"Ah, ha! then you were courting my fair cousin?\" said Lisbeth, with a\nsmile. \"I thought as much.\"\n\n\"And she treated me like a dog!--worse, like a footman; nay, I might say\nlike a political prisoner.--But I will succeed yet,\" said he, striking\nhis brow with his clenched fist.\n\n\"Poor man! It would be dreadful to catch his wife deceiving him after\nbeing packed off by his mistress.\"\n\n\"Josepha?\" cried Crevel. \"Has Josepha thrown him over, packed him off,\nturned him out neck and crop? Bravo, Josepha, you have avenged me!\nI will send you a pair of pearls to hang in your ears, my\nex-sweetheart!--I knew nothing of it; for after I had seen you, on the\nday after that when the fair Adeline had shown me the door, I went back\nto visit the Lebas, at Corbeil, and have but just come back. Heloise\nplayed the very devil to get me into the country, and I have found out\nthe purpose of her game; she wanted me out of the way while she gave a\nhouse-warming in the Rue Chauchat, with some artists, and players, and\nwriters.--She took me in! But I can forgive her, for Heloise amuses me.\nShe is a Dejazet under a bushel. What a character the hussy is! There is\nthe note I found last evening:\n\n  \"'DEAR OLD CHAP,--I have pitched my tent in the Rue Chauchat. I\n  have taken the precaution of getting a few friends to clean up the\n  paint. All is well. Come when you please, monsieur; Hagar awaits\n  her Abraham.'\n\n\"Heloise will have some news for me, for she has her bohemia at her\nfingers' end.\"\n\n\"But Monsieur Hulot took the disaster very calmly,\" said Lisbeth.\n\n\"Impossible!\" cried Crevel, stopping in a parade as regular as the swing\nof a pendulum.\n\n\"Monsieur Hulot is not as young as he was,\" Lisbeth remarked\nsignificantly.\n\n\"I know that,\" said Crevel, \"but in one point we are alike: Hulot cannot\ndo without an attachment. He is capable of going back to his wife.\nIt would be a novelty for him, but an end to my vengeance. You smile,\nMademoiselle Fischer--ah! perhaps you know something?\"\n\n\"I am smiling at your notions,\" replied Lisbeth. \"Yes, my cousin is\nstill handsome enough to inspire a passion. I should certainly fall in\nlove with her if I were a man.\"\n\n\"Cut and come again!\" exclaimed Crevel. \"You are laughing at me.--The\nBaron has already found consolation?\"\n\nLisbeth bowed affirmatively.\n\n\"He is a lucky man if he can find a second Josepha within twenty-four\nhours!\" said Crevel. \"But I am not altogether surprised, for he told me\none evening at supper that when he was a young man he always had three\nmistresses on hand that he might not be left high and dry--the one he\nwas giving over, the one in possession, and the one he was courting for\na future emergency. He had some smart little work-woman in reserve, no\ndoubt--in his fish-pond--his _Parc-aux-cerfs_! He is very Louis XV., is\nmy gentleman. He is in luck to be so handsome!--However, he is ageing;\nhis face shows it.--He has taken up with some little milliner?\"\n\n\"Dear me, no,\" replied Lisbeth.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Crevel, \"what would I not do to hinder him from hanging up\nhis hat! I could not win back Josepha; women of that kind never come\nback to their first love.--Besides, it is truly said, such a return\nis not love.--But, Cousin Betty, I would pay down fifty thousand\nfrancs--that is to say, I would spend it--to rob that great good-looking\nfellow of his mistress, and to show him that a Major with a portly\nstomach and a brain made to become Mayor of Paris, though he is a\ngrandfather, is not to have his mistress tickled away by a poacher\nwithout turning the tables.\"\n\n\"My position,\" said Lisbeth, \"compels me to hear everything and know\nnothing. You may talk to me without fear; I never repeat a word of what\nany one may choose to tell me. How can you suppose I should ever break\nthat rule of conduct? No one would ever trust me again.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Crevel; \"you are the very jewel of old maids. Still,\ncome, there are exceptions. Look here, the family have never settled an\nallowance on you?\"\n\n\"But I have my pride,\" said Lisbeth. \"I do not choose to be an expense\nto anybody.\"\n\n\"If you will but help me to my revenge,\" the tradesman went on, \"I will\nsink ten thousand francs in an annuity for you. Tell me, my fair cousin,\ntell me who has stepped into Josepha's shoes, and you will have money to\npay your rent, your little breakfast in the morning, the good coffee you\nlove so well--you might allow yourself pure Mocha, heh! And a very good\nthing is pure Mocha!\"\n\n\"I do not care so much for the ten thousand francs in an annuity,\nwhich would bring me nearly five hundred francs a year, as for absolute\nsecrecy,\" said Lisbeth. \"For, you see, my dear Monsieur Crevel, the\nBaron is very good to me; he is to pay my rent----\"\n\n\"Oh yes, long may that last! I advise you to trust him,\" cried Crevel.\n\"Where will he find the money?\"\n\n\"Ah, that I don't know. At the same time, he is spending more than\nthirty thousand francs on the rooms he is furnishing for this little\nlady.\"\n\n\"A lady! What, a woman in society; the rascal, what luck he has! He is\nthe only favorite!\"\n\n\"A married woman, and quite the lady,\" Lisbeth affirmed.\n\n\"Really and truly?\" cried Crevel, opening wide eyes flashing with envy,\nquite as much as at the magic words _quite the lady_.\n\n\"Yes, really,\" said Lisbeth. \"Clever, a musician, three-and-twenty, a\npretty, innocent face, a dazzling white skin, teeth like a puppy's, eyes\nlike stars, a beautiful forehead--and tiny feet, I never saw the like,\nthey are not wider than her stay-busk.\"\n\n\"And ears?\" asked Crevel, keenly alive to this catalogue of charms.\n\n\"Ears for a model,\" she replied.\n\n\"And small hands?\"\n\n\"I tell you, in few words, a gem of a woman--and high-minded, and\nmodest, and refined! A beautiful soul, an angel--and with every\ndistinction, for her father was a Marshal of France----\"\n\n\"A Marshal of France!\" shrieked Crevel, positively bounding with\nexcitement. \"Good Heavens! by the Holy Piper! By all the joys in\nParadise!--The rascal!--I beg your pardon, Cousin, I am going crazy!--I\nthink I would give a hundred thousand francs----\"\n\n\"I dare say you would, and, I tell you, she is a respectable woman--a\nwoman of virtue. The Baron has forked out handsomely.\"\n\n\"He has not a sou, I tell you.\"\n\n\"There is a husband he has pushed----\"\n\n\"Where did he push him?\" asked Crevel, with a bitter laugh.\n\n\"He is promoted to be second in his office--this husband who will\noblige, no doubt;--and his name is down for the Cross of the Legion of\nHonor.\"\n\n\"The Government ought to be judicious and respect those who have the\nCross by not flinging it broadcast,\" said Crevel, with the look of an\naggrieved politician. \"But what is there about the man--that old bulldog\nof a Baron?\" he went on. \"It seems to me that I am quite a match for\nhim,\" and he struck an attitude as he looked at himself in the glass.\n\"Heloise has told me many a time, at moments when a woman speaks the\ntruth, that I was wonderful.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Lisbeth, \"women like big men; they are almost always\ngood-natured; and if I had to decide between you and the Baron, I should\nchoose you. Monsieur Hulot is amusing, handsome, and has a figure; but\nyou, you are substantial, and then--you see--you look an even greater\nscamp than he does.\"\n\n\"It is incredible how all women, even pious women, take to men who have\nthat about them!\" exclaimed Crevel, putting his arm round Lisbeth's\nwaist, he was so jubilant.\n\n\"The difficulty does not lie there,\" said Betty. \"You must see that a\nwoman who is getting so many advantages will not be unfaithful to\nher patron for nothing; and it would cost you more than a hundred odd\nthousand francs, for our little friend can look forward to seeing her\nhusband at the head of his office within two years' time.--It is poverty\nthat is dragging the poor little angel into that pit.\"\n\nCrevel was striding up and down the drawing-room in a state of frenzy.\n\n\"He must be uncommonly fond of the woman?\" he inquired after a pause,\nwhile his desires, thus goaded by Lisbeth, rose to a sort of madness.\n\n\"You may judge for yourself,\" replied Lisbeth. \"I don't believe he has\nhad _that_ of her,\" said she, snapping her thumbnail against one of her\nenormous white teeth, \"and he has given her ten thousand francs' worth\nof presents already.\"\n\n\"What a good joke it would be!\" cried Crevel, \"if I got to the winning\npost first!\"\n\n\"Good heavens! It is too bad of me to be telling you all this\ntittle-tattle,\" said Lisbeth, with an air of compunction.\n\n\"No.--I mean to put your relations to the blush. To-morrow I shall\ninvest in your name such a sum in five-per-cents as will give you\nsix hundred francs a year; but then you must tell me everything--his\nDulcinea's name and residence. To you I will make a clean breast of\nit.--I never have had a real lady for a mistress, and it is the height\nof my ambition. Mahomet's houris are nothing in comparison with what I\nfancy a woman of fashion must be. In short, it is my dream, my mania,\nand to such a point, that I declare to you the Baroness Hulot to me will\nnever be fifty,\" said he, unconsciously plagiarizing one of the greatest\nwits of the last century. \"I assure you, my good Lisbeth, I am prepared\nto sacrifice a hundred, two hundred--Hush! Here are the young people,\nI see them crossing the courtyard. I shall never have learned anything\nthrough you, I give you my word of honor; for I do not want you to lose\nthe Baron's confidence, quite the contrary. He must be amazingly fond of\nthis woman--that old boy.\"\n\n\"He is crazy about her,\" said Lisbeth. \"He could not find forty thousand\nfrancs to marry his daughter off, but he has got them somehow for his\nnew passion.\"\n\n\"And do you think that she loves him?\"\n\n\"At his age!\" said the old maid.\n\n\"Oh, what an owl I am!\" cried Crevel, \"when I myself allowed Heloise to\nkeep her artist exactly as Henri IX. allowed Gabrielle her Bellegrade.\nAlas! old age, old age!--Good-morning, Celestine. How do, my jewel!--And\nthe brat? Ah! here he comes; on my honor, he is beginning to be like\nme!--Good-day, Hulot--quite well? We shall soon be having another\nwedding in the family.\"\n\nCelestine and her husband, as a hint to their father, glanced at the old\nmaid, who audaciously asked, in reply to Crevel:\n\n\"Indeed--whose?\"\n\nCrevel put on an air of reserve which was meant to convey that he would\nmake up for her indiscretions.\n\n\"That of Hortense,\" he replied; \"but it is not yet quite settled. I have\njust come from the Lebas', and they were talking of Mademoiselle Popinot\nas a suitable match for their son, the young councillor, for he would\nlike to get the presidency of a provincial court.--Now, come to dinner.\"\n\n\n\nBy seven o'clock Lisbeth had returned home in an omnibus, for she was\neager to see Wenceslas, whose dupe she had been for three weeks, and to\nwhom she was carrying a basket filled with fruit by the hands of Crevel\nhimself, whose attentions were doubled towards _his_ Cousin Betty.\n\nShe flew up to the attic at a pace that took her breath away, and found\nthe artist finishing the ornamentation of a box to be presented to the\nadored Hortense. The framework of the lid represented hydrangeas--in\nFrench called _Hortensias_--among which little Loves were playing. The\npoor lover, to enable him to pay for the materials of the box, of which\nthe panels were of malachite, had designed two candlesticks for Florent\nand Chanor, and sold them the copyright--two admirable pieces of work.\n\n\"You have been working too hard these last few days, my dear fellow,\"\nsaid Lisbeth, wiping the perspiration from his brow, and giving him\na kiss. \"Such laborious diligence is really dangerous in the month\nof August. Seriously, you may injure your health. Look, here are some\npeaches and plums from Monsieur Crevel.--Now, do not worry yourself so\nmuch; I have borrowed two thousand francs, and, short of some disaster,\nwe can repay them when you sell your clock. At the same time, the lender\nseems to me suspicious, for he has just sent in this document.\"\n\nShe laid the writ under the model sketch of the statue of General\nMontcornet.\n\n\"For whom are you making this pretty thing?\" said she, taking up the\nmodel sprays of hydrangea in red wax which Wenceslas had laid down while\neating the fruit.\n\n\"For a jeweler.\"\n\n\"For what jeweler?\"\n\n\"I do not know. Stidmann asked me to make something out of them, as he\nis very busy.\"\n\n\"But these,\" she said in a deep voice, \"are _Hortensias_. How is it that\nyou have never made anything in wax for me? Is it so difficult to design\na pin, a little box--what not, as a keepsake?\" and she shot a fearful\nglance at the artist, whose eyes were happily lowered. \"And yet you say\nyou love me?\"\n\n\"Can you doubt it, mademoiselle?\"\n\n\"That is indeed an ardent _mademoiselle_!--Why, you have been my only\nthought since I found you dying--just there. When I saved you, you vowed\nyou were mine, I mean to hold you to that pledge; but I made a vow to\nmyself! I said to myself, 'Since the boy says he is mine, I mean to make\nhim rich and happy!' Well, and I can make your fortune.\"\n\n\"How?\" said the hapless artist, at the height of joy, and too artless to\ndream of a snare.\n\n\"Why, thus,\" said she.\n\nLisbeth could not deprive herself of the savage pleasure of gazing at\nWenceslas, who looked up at her with filial affection, the expression\nreally of his love for Hortense, which deluded the old maid. Seeing in\na man's eyes, for the first time in her life, the blazing torch of\npassion, she fancied it was for her that it was lighted.\n\n\"Monsieur Crevel will back us to the extent of a hundred thousand francs\nto start in business, if, as he says, you will marry me. He has queer\nideas, has the worthy man.--Well, what do you say to it?\" she added.\n\nThe artist, as pale as the dead, looked at his benefactress with a\nlustreless eye, which plainly spoke his thoughts. He stood stupefied and\nopen-mouthed.\n\n\"I never before was so distinctly told that I am hideous,\" said she,\nwith a bitter laugh.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said Steinbock, \"my benefactress can never be ugly in\nmy eyes; I have the greatest affection for you. But I am not yet thirty,\nand----\"\n\n\"I am forty-three,\" said Lisbeth. \"My cousin Adeline is forty-eight, and\nmen are still madly in love with her; but then she is handsome--she is!\"\n\n\"Fifteen years between us, mademoiselle! How could we get on together!\nFor both our sakes I think we should be wise to think it over. My\ngratitude shall be fully equal to your great kindness.--And your money\nshall be repaid in a few days.\"\n\n\"My money!\" cried she. \"You treat me as if I were nothing but an\nunfeeling usurer.\"\n\n\"Forgive me,\" said Wenceslas, \"but you remind me of it so often.--Well,\nit is you who have made me; do not crush me.\"\n\n\"You mean to be rid of me, I can see,\" said she, shaking her head. \"Who\nhas endowed you with this strength of ingratitude--you who are a man of\npapier-mache? Have you ceased to trust me--your good genius?--me, when\nI have spent so many nights working for you--when I have given you every\nfranc I have saved in my lifetime--when for four years I have shared my\nbread with you, the bread of a hard-worked woman, and given you all I\nhad, to my very courage.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle--no more, no more!\" he cried, kneeling before her with\nuplifted hands. \"Say not another word! In three days I will tell you,\nyou shall know all.--Let me, let me be happy,\" and he kissed her hands.\n\"I love--and I am loved.\"\n\n\"Well, well, my child, be happy,\" she said, lifting him up. And she\nkissed his forehead and hair with the eagerness that a man condemned to\ndeath must feel as he lives through the last morning.\n\n\"Ah! you are of all creatures the noblest and best! You are a match for\nthe woman I love,\" said the poor artist.\n\n\"I love you well enough to tremble for your future fate,\" said she\ngloomily. \"Judas hanged himself--the ungrateful always come to a bad\nend! You are deserting me, and you will never again do any good work.\nConsider whether, without being married--for I know I am an old maid,\nand I do not want to smother the blossom of your youth, your poetry, as\nyou call it, in my arms, that are like vine-stocks--but whether,\nwithout being married, we could not get on together? Listen; I have\nthe commercial spirit; I could save you a fortune in the course of ten\nyears' work, for Economy is my name!--while, with a young wife, who\nwould be sheer Expenditure, you would squander everything; you would\nwork only to indulge her. But happiness creates nothing but memories.\nEven I, when I am thinking of you, sit for hours with my hands in my\nlap----\n\n\"Come, Wenceslas, stay with me.--Look here, I understand all about\nit; you shall have your mistresses; pretty ones too, like that little\nMarneffe woman who wants to see you, and who will give you happiness you\ncould never find with me. Then, when I have saved you thirty thousand\nfrancs a year in the funds----\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle, you are an angel, and I shall never forget this hour,\"\nsaid Wenceslas, wiping away his tears.\n\n\"That is how I like to see you, my child,\" said she, gazing at him with\nrapture.\n\nVanity is so strong a power in us all that Lisbeth believed in her\ntriumph. She had conceded so much when offering him Madame Marneffe. It\nwas the crowning emotion of her life; for the first time she felt the\nfull tide of joy rising in her heart. To go through such an experience\nagain she would have sold her soul to the Devil.\n\n\"I am engaged to be married,\" Steinbock replied, \"and I love a woman\nwith whom no other can compete or compare.--But you are, and always will\nbe, to me the mother I have lost.\"\n\nThe words fell like an avalanche of snow on a burning crater. Lisbeth\nsat down. She gazed with despondent eyes on the youth before her, on his\naristocratic beauty--the artist's brow, the splendid hair, everything\nthat appealed to her suppressed feminine instincts, and tiny tears\nmoistened her eyes for an instant and immediately dried up. She looked\nlike one of those meagre statues which the sculptors of the Middle Ages\ncarved on monuments.\n\n\"I cannot curse you,\" said she, suddenly rising. \"You--you are but a\nboy. God preserve you!\"\n\nShe went downstairs and shut herself into her own room.\n\n\"She is in love with me, poor creature!\" said Wenceslas to himself. \"And\nhow fervently eloquent! She is crazy.\"\n\nThis last effort on the part of an arid and narrow nature to keep hold\non an embodiment of beauty and poetry was, in truth, so violent that it\ncan only be compared to the frenzied vehemence of a shipwrecked creature\nmaking the last struggle to reach shore.\n\nOn the next day but one, at half-past four in the morning, when Count\nSteinbock was sunk in the deepest sleep, he heard a knock at the door of\nhis attic; he rose to open it, and saw two men in shabby clothing, and a\nthird, whose dress proclaimed him a bailiff down on his luck.\n\n\"You are Monsieur Wenceslas, Count Steinbock?\" said this man.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"My name is Grasset, sir, successor to Louchard, sheriff's officer----\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"You are under arrest, sir. You must come with us to prison--to\nClichy.--Please to get dressed.--We have done the civil, as you see; I\nhave brought no police, and there is a hackney cab below.\"\n\n\"You are safely nabbed, you see,\" said one of the bailiffs; \"and we look\nto you to be liberal.\"\n\nSteinbock dressed and went downstairs, a man holding each arm; when he\nwas in the cab, the driver started without orders, as knowing where he\nwas to go, and within half an hour the unhappy foreigner found himself\nsafely under bolt and bar without even a remonstrance, so utterly amazed\nwas he.\n\nAt ten o'clock he was sent for to the prison-office, where he found\nLisbeth, who, in tears, gave him some money to feed himself adequately\nand to pay for a room large enough to work in.\n\n\"My dear boy,\" said she, \"never say a word of your arrest to anybody,\ndo not write to a living soul; it would ruin you for life; we must hide\nthis blot on your character. I will soon have you out. I will collect\nthe money--be quite easy. Write down what you want for your work. You\nshall soon be free, or I will die for it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I shall owe you my life a second time!\" cried he, \"for I should\nlose more than my life if I were thought a bad fellow.\"\n\nLisbeth went off in great glee; she hoped, by keeping her artist under\nlock and key, to put a stop to his marriage by announcing that he was\na married man, pardoned by the efforts of his wife, and gone off to\nRussia.\n\nTo carry out this plan, at about three o'clock she went to the Baroness,\nthough it was not the day when she was due to dine with her; but she\nwished to enjoy the anguish which Hortense must endure at the hour when\nWenceslas was in the habit of making his appearance.\n\n\"Have you come to dinner?\" asked the Baroness, concealing her\ndisappointment.\n\n\"Well, yes.\"\n\n\"That's well,\" replied Hortense. \"I will go and tell them to be\npunctual, for you do not like to be kept waiting.\"\n\nHortense nodded reassuringly to her mother, for she intended to tell the\nman-servant to send away Monsieur Steinbock if he should call; the man,\nhowever, happened to be out, so Hortense was obliged to give her orders\nto the maid, and the girl went upstairs to fetch her needlework and sit\nin the ante-room.\n\n\"And about my lover?\" said Cousin Betty to Hortense, when the girl came\nback. \"You never ask about him now?\"\n\n\"To be sure, what is he doing?\" said Hortense. \"He has become famous.\nYou ought to be very happy,\" she added in an undertone to Lisbeth.\n\"Everybody is talking of Monsieur Wenceslas Steinbock.\"\n\n\"A great deal too much,\" replied she in her clear tones. \"Monsieur is\ndeparting.--If it were only a matter of charming him so far as to defy\nthe attractions of Paris, I know my power; but they say that in order to\nsecure the services of such an artist, the Emperor Nichols has pardoned\nhim----\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said the Baroness.\n\n\"When did you hear that?\" asked Hortense, who felt as if her heart had\nthe cramp.\n\n\"Well,\" said the villainous Lisbeth, \"a person to whom he is bound by\nthe most sacred ties--his wife--wrote yesterday to tell him so. He\nwants to be off. Oh, he will be a great fool to give up France to go to\nRussia!--\"\n\nHortense looked at her mother, but her head sank on one side; the\nBaroness was only just in time to support her daughter, who dropped\nfainting, and as white as her lace kerchief.\n\n\"Lisbeth! you have killed my child!\" cried the Baroness. \"You were born\nto be our curse!\"\n\n\"Bless me! what fault of mine is this, Adeline?\" replied Lisbeth, as she\nrose with a menacing aspect, of which the Baroness, in her alarm, took\nno notice.\n\n\"I was wrong,\" said Adeline, supporting the girl. \"Ring.\"\n\nAt this instant the door opened, the women both looked round, and saw\nWenceslas Steinbock, who had been admitted by the cook in the maid's\nabsence.\n\n\"Hortense!\" cried the artist, with one spring to the group of women. And\nhe kissed his betrothed before her mother's eyes, on the forehead, and\nso reverently, that the Baroness could not be angry. It was a better\nrestorative than any smelling salts. Hortense opened her eyes, saw\nWenceslas, and her color came back. In a few minutes she had quite\nrecovered.\n\n\"So this was your secret?\" said Lisbeth, smiling at Wenceslas, and\naffecting to guess the facts from her two cousins' confusion.\n\n\"But how did you steal away my lover?\" said she, leading Hortense into\nthe garden.\n\nHortense artlessly told the romance of her love. Her father and mother,\nshe said, being convinced that Lisbeth would never marry, had authorized\nthe Count's visits. Only Hortense, like a full-blown Agnes, attributed\nto chance her purchase of the group and the introduction of the artist,\nwho, by her account, had insisted on knowing the name of his first\npurchaser.\n\nPresently Steinbock came out to join the cousins, and thanked the old\nmaid effusively for his prompt release. Lisbeth replied Jesuitically\nthat the creditor having given very vague promises, she had not hoped\nto be able to get him out before the morrow, and that the person who\nhad lent her the money, ashamed, perhaps, of such mean conduct, had been\nbeforehand with her. The old maid appeared to be perfectly content, and\ncongratulated Wenceslas on his happiness.\n\n\"You bad boy!\" said she, before Hortense and her mother, \"if you had\nonly told me the evening before last that you loved my cousin Hortense,\nand that she loved you, you would have spared me many tears. I thought\nthat you were deserting your old friend, your governess; while, on the\ncontrary, you are to become my cousin; henceforth, you will be connected\nwith me, remotely, it is true, but by ties that amply justify the\nfeelings I have for you.\" And she kissed Wenceslas on the forehead.\n\nHortense threw herself into Lisbeth's arms and melted into tears.\n\n\"I owe my happiness to you,\" said she, \"and I will never forget it.\"\n\n\"Cousin Betty,\" said the Baroness, embracing Lisbeth in her excitement\nat seeing matters so happily settled, \"the Baron and I owe you a debt of\ngratitude, and we will pay it. Come and talk things over with me,\" she\nadded, leading her away.\n\nSo Lisbeth, to all appearances, was playing the part of a good angel\nto the whole family; she was adored by Crevel and Hulot, by Adeline and\nHortense.\n\n\"We wish you to give up working,\" said the Baroness. \"If you earn forty\nsous a day, Sundays excepted, that makes six hundred francs a year.\nWell, then, how much have you saved?\"\n\n\"Four thousand five hundred francs.\"\n\n\"Poor Betty!\" said her cousin.\n\nShe raised her eyes to heaven, so deeply was she moved at the thought of\nall the labor and privation such a sum must represent accumulated during\nthirty years.\n\nLisbeth, misunderstanding the meaning of the exclamation, took it as the\nironical pity of the successful woman, and her hatred was strengthened\nby a large infusion of venom at the very moment when her cousin had cast\noff her last shred of distrust of the tyrant of her childhood.\n\n\"We will add ten thousand five hundred francs to that sum,\" said\nAdeline, \"and put it in trust so that you shall draw the interest for\nlife with reversion to Hortense. Thus, you will have six hundred francs\na year.\"\n\nLisbeth feigned the utmost satisfaction. When she went in, her\nhandkerchief to her eyes, wiping away tears of joy, Hortense told her of\nall the favors being showered on Wenceslas, beloved of the family.\n\nSo when the Baron came home, he found his family all present; for the\nBaroness had formally accepted Wenceslas by the title of Son, and the\nwedding was fixed, if her husband should approve, for a day a fortnight\nhence. The moment he came into the drawing-room, Hulot was rushed at\nby his wife and daughter, who ran to meet him, Adeline to speak to him\nprivately, and Hortense to kiss him.\n\n\"You have gone too far in pledging me to this, madame,\" said the Baron\nsternly. \"You are not married yet,\" he added with a look at Steinbock,\nwho turned pale.\n\n\"He has heard of my imprisonment,\" said the luckless artist to himself.\n\n\"Come, children,\" said he, leading his daughter and the young man\ninto the garden; they all sat down on the moss-eaten seat in the\nsummer-house.\n\n\"Monsieur le Comte, do you love my daughter as well as I loved her\nmother?\" he asked.\n\n\"More, monsieur,\" said the sculptor.\n\n\"Her mother was a peasant's daughter, and had not a farthing of her\nown.\"\n\n\"Only give me Mademoiselle Hortense just as she is, without a trousseau\neven----\"\n\n\"So I should think!\" said the Baron, smiling. \"Hortense is the daughter\nof the Baron Hulot d'Ervy, Councillor of State, high up in the War\nOffice, Grand Commander of the Legion of Honor, and the brother to Count\nHulot, whose glory is immortal, and who will ere long be Marshal of\nFrance! And--she has a marriage portion.\n\n\"It is true,\" said the impassioned artist. \"I must seem very ambitious.\nBut if my dear Hortense were a laborer's daughter, I would marry\nher----\"\n\n\"That is just what I wanted to know,\" replied the Baron. \"Run away,\nHortense, and leave me to talk business with Monsieur le Comte.--He\nreally loves you, you see!\"\n\n\"Oh, papa, I was sure you were only in jest,\" said the happy girl.\n\n\"My dear Steinbock,\" said the Baron, with elaborate grace of diction and\nthe most perfect manners, as soon as he and the artist were alone, \"I\npromised my son a fortune of two hundred thousand francs, of which\nthe poor boy has never had a sou; and he never will get any of it. My\ndaughter's fortune will also be two hundred thousand francs, for which\nyou will give a receipt----\"\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur le Baron.\"\n\n\"You go too fast,\" said Hulot. \"Have the goodness to hear me out. I\ncannot expect from a son-in-law such devotion as I look for from my son.\nMy son knew exactly all I could and would do for his future promotion:\nhe will be a Minister, and will easily make good his two hundred\nthousand francs. But with you, young man, matters are different. I shall\ngive you a bond for sixty thousand francs in State funds at five per\ncent, in your wife's name. This income will be diminished by a small\ncharge in the form of an annuity to Lisbeth; but she will not live long;\nshe is consumptive, I know. Tell no one; it is a secret; let the poor\nsoul die in peace.--My daughter will have a trousseau worth twenty\nthousand francs; her mother will give her six thousand francs worth of\ndiamonds.\n\n\"Monsieur, you overpower me!\" said Steinbock, quite bewildered.\n\n\"As to the remaining hundred and twenty thousand francs----\"\n\n\"Say no more, monsieur,\" said Wenceslas. \"I ask only for my beloved\nHortense----\"\n\n\"Will you listen to me, effervescent youth!--As to the remaining hundred\nand twenty thousand francs, I have not got them; but you will have\nthem--\"\n\n\"Monsieur?\"\n\n\"You will get them from the Government, in payment for commissions which\nI will secure for you, I pledge you my word of honor. You are to have\na studio, you see, at the Government depot. Exhibit a few fine statues,\nand I will get you received at the Institute. The highest personages\nhave a regard for my brother and for me, and I hope to succeed in\nsecuring for you a commission for sculpture at Versailles up to a\nquarter of the whole sum. You will have orders from the City of Paris\nand from the Chamber of Peers; in short, my dear fellow, you will have\nso many that you will be obliged to get assistants. In that way I\nshall pay off my debt to you. You must say whether this way of giving a\nportion will suit you; whether you are equal to it.\"\n\n\"I am equal to making a fortune for my wife single-handed if all else\nfailed!\" cried the artist-nobleman.\n\n\"That is what I admire!\" cried the Baron. \"High-minded youth that fears\nnothing. Come,\" he added, clasping hands with the young sculptor to\nconclude the bargain, \"you have my consent. We will sign the contract\non Sunday next, and the wedding shall be on the following Saturday, my\nwife's fete-day.\"\n\n\"It is all right,\" said the Baroness to her daughter, who stood glued to\nthe window. \"Your suitor and your father are embracing each other.\"\n\nOn going home in the evening, Wenceslas found the solution of the\nmystery of his release. The porter handed him a thick sealed packet,\ncontaining the schedule of his debts, with a signed receipt affixed at\nthe bottom of the writ, and accompanied by this letter:--\n\n  \"MY DEAR WENCESLAS,--I went to fetch you at ten o'clock this\n  morning to introduce you to a Royal Highness who wishes to see\n  you. There I learned that the duns had had you conveyed to a\n  certain little domain--chief town, _Clichy Castle_.\n\n  \"So off I went to Leon de Lora, and told him, for a joke, that you\n  could not leave your country quarters for lack of four thousand\n  francs, and that you would spoil your future prospects if you did\n  not make your bow to your royal patron. Happily, Bridau was there\n  --a man of genius, who has known what it is to be poor, and has\n  heard your story. My boy, between them they have found the money,\n  and I went off to pay the Turk who committed treason against\n  genius by putting you in quod. As I had to be at the Tuileries at\n  noon, I could not wait to see you sniffing the outer air. I know\n  you to be a gentleman, and I answered for you to my two friends\n  --but look them up to-morrow.\n\n  \"Leon and Bridau do not want your cash; they will ask you to do\n  them each a group--and they are right. At least, so thinks the man\n  who wishes he could sign himself your rival, but is only your\n  faithful ally,\n\n  \"STIDMANN.\n\n  \"P. S.--I told the Prince you were away, and would not return till\n  to-morrow, so he said, 'Very good--to-morrow.'\"\n\n\nCount Wenceslas went to bed in sheets of purple, without a rose-leaf to\nwrinkle them, that Favor can make for us--Favor, the halting divinity\nwho moves more slowly for men of genius than either Justice or Fortune,\nbecause Jove has not chosen to bandage her eyes. Hence, lightly deceived\nby the display of impostors, and attracted by their frippery and\ntrumpets, she spends the time in seeing them and the money in paying\nthem which she ought to devote to seeking out men of merit in the nooks\nwhere they hide.\n\nIt will now be necessary to explain how Monsieur le Baron Hulot had\ncontrived to count up his expenditure on Hortense's wedding portion,\nand at the same time to defray the frightful cost of the charming rooms\nwhere Madame Marneffe was to make her home. His financial scheme bore\nthat stamp of talent which leads prodigals and men in love into the\nquagmires where so many disasters await them. Nothing can demonstrate\nmore completely the strange capacity communicated by vice, to which\nwe owe the strokes of skill which ambitious or voluptuous men can\noccasionally achieve--or, in short, any of the Devil's pupils.\n\nOn the day before, old Johann Fischer, unable to pay thirty thousand\nfrancs drawn for on him by his nephew, had found himself under the\nnecessity of stopping payment unless the Baron could remit the sum.\n\nThis ancient worthy, with the white hairs of seventy years, had such\nblind confidence in Hulot--who, to the old Bonapartist, was an emanation\nfrom the Napoleonic sun--that he was calmly pacing his anteroom with\nthe bank clerk, in the little ground-floor apartment that he rented\nfor eight hundred francs a year as the headquarters of his extensive\ndealings in corn and forage.\n\n\"Marguerite is gone to fetch the money from close by,\" said he.\n\nThe official, in his gray uniform braided with silver, was so convinced\nof the old Alsatian's honesty, that he was prepared to leave the thirty\nthousand francs' worth of bills in his hands; but the old man would not\nlet him go, observing that the clock had not yet struck eight. A cab\ndrew up, the old man rushed into the street, and held out his hand\nto the Baron with sublime confidence--Hulot handed him out thirty\nthousand-franc notes.\n\n\"Go on three doors further, and I will tell you why,\" said Fischer.\n\n\"Here, young man,\" he said, returning to count out the money to the bank\nemissary, whom he then saw to the door.\n\nWhen the clerk was out of sight, Fischer called back the cab containing\nhis august nephew, Napoleon's right hand, and said, as he led him into\nthe house:\n\n\"You do not want them to know at the Bank of France that you paid me the\nthirty thousand francs, after endorsing the bills?--It was bad enough to\nsee them signed by such a man as you!--\"\n\n\"Come to the bottom of your little garden, Father Fischer,\" said the\nimportant man. \"You are hearty?\" he went on, sitting down under a vine\narbor and scanning the old man from head to foot, as a dealer in human\nflesh scans a substitute for the conscription.\n\n\"Ay, hearty enough for a tontine,\" said the lean little old man; his\nsinews were wiry, and his eye bright.\n\n\"Does heat disagree with you?\"\n\n\"Quite the contrary.\"\n\n\"What do you say to Africa?\"\n\n\"A very nice country!--The French went there with the little Corporal\"\n(Napoleon).\n\n\"To get us all out of the present scrape, you must go to Algiers,\" said\nthe Baron.\n\n\"And how about my business?\"\n\n\"An official in the War Office, who has to retire, and has not enough to\nlive on with his pension, will buy your business.\"\n\n\"And what am I to do in Algiers?\"\n\n\"Supply the Commissariat with victuals, corn, and forage; I have your\ncommission ready filled in and signed. You can collect supplies in the\ncountry at seventy per cent below the prices at which you can credit\nus.\"\n\n\"How shall we get them?\"\n\n\"Oh, by raids, by taxes in kind, and the Khaliphat.--The country is\nlittle known, though we settled there eight years ago; Algeria produces\nvast quantities of corn and forage. When this produce belongs to Arabs,\nwe take it from them under various pretences; when it belongs to us, the\nArabs try to get it back again. There is a great deal of fighting over\nthe corn, and no one ever knows exactly how much each party has stolen\nfrom the other. There is not time in the open field to measure the\ncorn as we do in the Paris market, or the hay as it is sold in the Rue\nd'Enfer. The Arab chiefs, like our Spahis, prefer hard cash, and sell\nthe plunder at a very low price. The Commissariat needs a fixed quantity\nand must have it. It winks at exorbitant prices calculated on the\ndifficulty of procuring food, and the dangers to which every form of\ntransport is exposed. That is Algiers from the army contractor's point\nof view.\n\n\"It is a muddle tempered by the ink-bottle, like every incipient\ngovernment. We shall not see our way through it for another ten\nyears--we who have to do the governing; but private enterprise has sharp\neyes.--So I am sending you there to make a fortune; I give you the job,\nas Napoleon put an impoverished Marshal at the head of a kingdom where\nsmuggling might be secretly encouraged.\n\n\"I am ruined, my dear Fischer; I must have a hundred thousand francs\nwithin a year.\"\n\n\"I see no harm in getting it out of the Bedouins,\" said the Alsatian\ncalmly. \"It was always done under the Empire----\"\n\n\"The man who wants to buy your business will be here this morning, and\npay you ten thousand francs down,\" the Baron went on. \"That will be\nenough, I suppose, to take you to Africa?\"\n\nThe old man nodded assent.\n\n\"As to capital out there, be quite easy. I will draw the remainder of\nthe money due if I find it necessary.\"\n\n\"All I have is yours--my very blood,\" said old Fischer.\n\n\"Oh, do not be uneasy,\" said Hulot, fancying that his uncle saw more\nclearly than was the fact. \"As to our excise dealings, your character\nwill not be impugned. Everything depends on the authority at your back;\nnow I myself appointed the authorities out there; I am sure of them.\nThis, Uncle Fischer, is a dead secret between us. I know you well, and I\nhave spoken out without concealment or circumlocution.\"\n\n\"It shall be done,\" said the old man. \"And it will go on----?\"\n\n\"For two years, You will have made a hundred thousand francs of your own\nto live happy on in the Vosges.\"\n\n\"I will do as you wish; my honor is yours,\" said the little old man\nquietly.\n\n\"That is the sort of man I like.--However, you must not go till you have\nseen your grand-niece happily married. She is to be a Countess.\"\n\nBut even taxes and raids and the money paid by the War Office clerk for\nFischer's business could not forthwith provide sixty thousand francs to\ngive Hortense, to say nothing of her trousseau, which was to cost about\nfive thousand, and the forty thousand spent--or to be spent--on Madame\nMarneffe.\n\nWhere, then had the Baron found the thirty thousand francs he had just\nproduced? This was the history.\n\nA few days previously Hulot had insured his life for the sum of a\nhundred and fifty thousand francs, for three years, in two separate\ncompanies. Armed with the policies, of which he paid the premium, he had\nspoken as follows to the Baron de Nucingen, a peer of the Chamber, in\nwhose carriage he found himself after a sitting, driving home, in fact,\nto dine with him:--\n\n\"Baron, I want seventy thousand francs, and I apply to you. You must\nfind some one to lend his name, to whom I will make over the right to\ndraw my pay for three years; it amounts to twenty-five thousand francs a\nyear--that is, seventy-five thousand francs.--You will say, 'But you\nmay die'\"--the banker signified his assent--\"Here, then, is a policy of\ninsurance for a hundred and fifty thousand francs, which I will deposit\nwith you till you have drawn up the eighty thousand francs,\" said Hulot,\nproducing the document form his pocket.\n\n\"But if you should lose your place?\" said the millionaire Baron,\nlaughing.\n\nThe other Baron--not a millionaire--looked grave.\n\n\"Be quite easy; I only raised the question to show you that I was not\ndevoid of merit in handing you the sum. Are you so short of cash? for\nthe Bank will take your signature.\"\n\n\"My daughter is to be married,\" said Baron Hulot, \"and I have no\nfortune--like every one else who remains in office in these thankless\ntimes, when five hundred ordinary men seated on benches will never\nreward the men who devote themselves to the service as handsomely as the\nEmperor did.\"\n\n\"Well, well; but you had Josepha on your hands!\" replied Nucingen, \"and\nthat accounts for everything. Between ourselves, the Duc d'Herouville\nhas done you a very good turn by removing that leech from sucking your\npurse dry. 'I have known what that is, and can pity your case,'\" he\nquoted. \"Take a friend's advice: Shut up shop, or you will be done for.\"\n\nThis dirty business was carried out in the name of one Vauvinet, a small\nmoney-lender; one of those jobbers who stand forward to screen great\nbanking houses, like the little fish that is said to attend the shark.\nThis stock-jobber's apprentice was so anxious to gain the patronage of\nMonsieur le Baron Hulot, that he promised the great man to negotiate\nbills of exchange for thirty thousand francs at eighty days, and pledged\nhimself to renew them four times, and never pass them out of his hands.\n\nFischer's successor was to pay forty thousand francs for the house\nand the business, with the promise that he should supply forage to a\ndepartment close to Paris.\n\nThis was the desperate maze of affairs into which a man who had\nhitherto been absolutely honest was led by his passions--one of the\nbest administrative officials under Napoleon--peculation to pay the\nmoney-lenders, and borrowing of the money-lenders to gratify his\npassions and provide for his daughter. All the efforts of this elaborate\nprodigality were directed at making a display before Madame Marneffe,\nand to playing Jupiter to this middle-class Danae. A man could not\nexpend more activity, intelligence, and presence of mind in the honest\nacquisition of a fortune than the Baron displayed in shoving his head\ninto a wasp's nest: He did all the business of his department, he\nhurried on the upholsterers, he talked to the workmen, he kept a sharp\nlookout on the smallest details of the house in the Rue Vanneau. Wholly\ndevoted to Madame Marneffe, he nevertheless attended the sittings of the\nChambers; he was everywhere at once, and neither his family nor anybody\nelse discovered where his thoughts were.\n\nAdeline, quite amazed to hear that her uncle was rescued, and to see a\nhandsome sum figure in the marriage-contract, was not altogether easy,\nin spite of her joy at seeing her daughter married under such creditable\ncircumstances. But, on the day before the wedding, fixed by the Baron\nto coincide with Madame Marneffe's removal to her new apartment, Hector\nallayed his wife's astonishment by this ministerial communication:--\n\n\"Now, Adeline, our girl is married; all our anxieties on the subject are\nat an end. The time is come for us to retire from the world: I shall not\nremain in office more than three years longer--only the time necessary\nto secure my pension. Why, henceforth, should we be at any unnecessary\nexpense? Our apartment costs us six thousand francs a year in rent, we\nhave four servants, we eat thirty thousand francs' worth of food in a\nyear. If you want me to pay off my bills--for I have pledged my salary\nfor the sums I needed to give Hortense her little money, and pay off\nyour uncle----\"\n\n\"You did very right!\" said she, interrupting her husband, and kissing\nhis hands.\n\nThis explanation relieved Adeline of all her fears.\n\n\"I shall have to ask some little sacrifices of you,\" he went on,\ndisengaging his hands and kissing his wife's brow. \"I have found in the\nRue Plumet a very good flat on the first floor, handsome, splendidly\npaneled, at only fifteen hundred francs a year, where you would only\nneed one woman to wait on you, and I could be quite content with a boy.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear.\"\n\n\"If we keep house in a quiet way, keeping up a proper appearance of\ncourse, we should not spend more than six thousand francs a year,\nexcepting my private account, which I will provide for.\"\n\nThe generous-hearted woman threw her arms round her husband's neck in\nher joy.\n\n\"How happy I shall be, beginning again to show you how truly I love\nyou!\" she exclaimed. \"And what a capital manager you are!\"\n\n\"We will have the children to dine with us once a week. I, as you know,\nrarely dine at home. You can very well dine twice a week with Victorin\nand twice a week with Hortense. And, as I believe, I may succeed in\nmaking matters up completely between Crevel and us; we can dine once a\nweek with him. These five dinners and our own at home will fill up the\nweek all but one day, supposing that we may occasionally be invited to\ndine elsewhere.\"\n\n\"I shall save a great deal for you,\" said Adeline.\n\n\"Oh!\" he cried, \"you are the pearl of women!\"\n\n\"My kind, divine Hector, I shall bless you with my latest breath,\" said\nshe, \"for you have done well for my dear Hortense.\"\n\nThis was the beginning of the end of the beautiful Madame Hulot's home;\nand, it may be added, of her being totally neglected, as Hulot had\nsolemnly promised Madame Marneffe.\n\nCrevel, the important and burly, being invited as a matter of course\nto the party given for the signing of the marriage-contract, behaved as\nthough the scene with which this drama opened had never taken place, as\nthough he had no grievance against the Baron. Celestin Crevel was quite\namiable; he was perhaps rather too much the ex-perfumer, but as a Major\nhe was beginning to acquire majestic dignity. He talked of dancing at\nthe wedding.\n\n\"Fair lady,\" said he politely to the Baroness, \"people like us know how\nto forget. Do not banish me from your home; honor me, pray, by gracing\nmy house with your presence now and then to meet your children. Be quite\neasy; I will never say anything of what lies buried at the bottom of my\nheart. I behaved, indeed, like an idiot, for I should lose too much by\ncutting myself off from seeing you.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, an honest woman has no ears for such speeches as those you\nrefer to. If you keep your word, you need not doubt that it will give me\npleasure to see the end of a coolness which must always be painful in a\nfamily.\"\n\n\"Well, you sulky old fellow,\" said Hulot, dragging Crevel out into the\ngarden, \"you avoid me everywhere, even in my own house. Are two admirers\nof the fair sex to quarrel for ever over a petticoat? Come; this is\nreally too plebeian!\"\n\n\"I, monsieur, am not such a fine man as you are, and my small\nattractions hinder me from repairing my losses so easily as you can----\"\n\n\"Sarcastic!\" said the Baron.\n\n\"Irony is allowable from the vanquished to the conquerer.\"\n\nThe conversation, begun in this strain, ended in a complete\nreconciliation; still Crevel maintained his right to take his revenge.\n\n\n\nMadame Marneffe particularly wished to be invited to Mademoiselle\nHulot's wedding. To enable him to receive his future mistress in his\ndrawing-room, the great official was obliged to invite all the clerks of\nhis division down to the deputy head-clerks inclusive. Thus a grand ball\nwas a necessity. The Baroness, as a prudent housewife, calculated that\nan evening party would cost less than a dinner, and allow of a larger\nnumber of invitations; so Hortense's wedding was much talked about.\n\nMarshal Prince Wissembourg and the Baron de Nucingen signed in behalf of\nthe bride, the Comtes de Rastignac and Popinot in behalf of Steinbock.\nThen, as the highest nobility among the Polish emigrants had been\ncivil to Count Steinbock since he had become famous, the artist thought\nhimself bound to invite them. The State Council, and the War Office to\nwhich the Baron belonged, and the army, anxious to do honor to the Comte\nde Forzheim, were all represented by their magnates. There were nearly\ntwo hundred indispensable invitations. How natural, then, that little\nMadame Marneffe was bent on figuring in all her glory amid such an\nassembly. The Baroness had, a month since, sold her diamonds to set up\nher daughter's house, while keeping the finest for the trousseau. The\nsale realized fifteen thousand francs, of which five thousand were\nsunk in Hortense's clothes. And what was ten thousand francs for the\nfurniture of the young folks' apartment, considering the demands of\nmodern luxury? However, young Monsieur and Madame Hulot, old Crevel, and\nthe Comte de Forzheim made very handsome presents, for the old\nsoldier had set aside a sum for the purchase of plate. Thanks to these\ncontributions, even an exacting Parisian would have been pleased with\nthe rooms the young couple had taken in the Rue Saint-Dominique, near\nthe Invalides. Everything seemed in harmony with their love, pure,\nhonest, and sincere.\n\nAt last the great day dawned--for it was to be a great day not only for\nWenceslas and Hortense, but for old Hulot too. Madame Marneffe was to\ngive a house-warming in her new apartment the day after becoming Hulot's\nmistress _en titre_, and after the marriage of the lovers.\n\nWho but has once in his life been a guest at a wedding-ball? Every\nreader can refer to his reminiscences, and will probably smile as he\ncalls up the images of all that company in their Sunday-best faces as\nwell as their finest frippery.\n\nIf any social event can prove the influence of environment, is it not\nthis? In fact, the Sunday-best mood of some reacts so effectually on\nthe rest that the men who are most accustomed to wearing full dress look\njust like those to whom the party is a high festival, unique in their\nlife. And think too of the serious old men to whom such things are\nso completely a matter of indifference, that they are wearing their\neveryday black coats; the long-married men, whose faces betray their sad\nexperience of the life the young pair are but just entering on; and the\nlighter elements, present as carbonic-acid gas is in champagne; and\nthe envious girls, the women absorbed in wondering if their dress is a\nsuccess, the poor relations whose parsimonious \"get-up\" contrasts with\nthat of the officials in uniform; and the greedy ones, thinking only of\nthe supper; and the gamblers, thinking only of cards.\n\nThere are some of every sort, rich and poor, envious and envied,\nphilosophers and dreamers, all grouped like the plants in a flower-bed\nround the rare, choice blossom, the bride. A wedding-ball is an epitome\nof the world.\n\nAt the liveliest moment of the evening Crevel led the Baron aside, and\nsaid in a whisper, with the most natural manner possible:\n\n\"By Jove! that's a pretty woman--the little lady in pink who has opened\na racking fire on you from her eyes.\"\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n\"The wife of that clerk you are promoting, heaven knows how!--Madame\nMarneffe.\"\n\n\"What do you know about it?\"\n\n\"Listen, Hulot; I will try to forgive you the ill you have done me if\nonly you will introduce me to her--I will take you to Heloise. Everybody\nis asking who is that charming creature. Are you sure that it will\nstrike no one how and why her husband's appointment got itself\nsigned?--You happy rascal, she is worth a whole office.--I would serve\nin her office only too gladly.--Come, cinna, let us be friends.\"\n\n\"Better friends than ever,\" said the Baron to the perfumer, \"and I\npromise you I will be a good fellow. Within a month you shall dine with\nthat little angel.--For it is an angel this time, old boy. And I advise\nyou, like me, to have done with the devils.\"\n\nCousin Betty, who had moved to the Rue Vanneau, into a nice little\napartment on the third floor, left the ball at ten o'clock, but came\nback to see with her own eyes the two bonds bearing twelve hundred\nfrancs interest; one of them was the property of the Countess Steinbock,\nthe other was in the name of Madame Hulot.\n\nIt is thus intelligible that Monsieur Crevel should have spoken to Hulot\nabout Madame Marneffe, as knowing what was a secret to the rest of the\nworld; for, as Monsieur Marneffe was away, no one but Lisbeth Fischer,\nbesides the Baron and Valerie, was initiated into the mystery.\n\nThe Baron had made a blunder in giving Madame Marneffe a dress far too\nmagnificent for the wife of a subordinate official; other women were\njealous alike of her beauty and of her gown. There was much whispering\nbehind fans, for the poverty of the Marneffes was known to every one in\nthe office; the husband had been petitioning for help at the very moment\nwhen the Baron had been so smitten with madame. Also, Hector could not\nconceal his exultation at seeing Valerie's success; and she, severely\nproper, very lady-like, and greatly envied, was the object of that\nstrict examination which women so greatly fear when they appear for the\nfirst time in a new circle of society.\n\nAfter seeing his wife into a carriage with his daughter and his\nson-in-law, Hulot managed to escape unperceived, leaving his son and\nCelestine to do the honors of the house. He got into Madame Marneffe's\ncarriage to see her home, but he found her silent and pensive, almost\nmelancholy.\n\n\"My happiness makes you very sad, Valerie,\" said he, putting his arm\nround her and drawing her to him.\n\n\"Can you wonder, my dear,\" said she, \"that a hapless woman should be a\nlittle depressed at the thought of her first fall from virtue, even when\nher husband's atrocities have set her free? Do you suppose that I have\nno soul, no beliefs, no religion? Your glee this evening has been really\ntoo barefaced; you have paraded me odiously. Really, a schoolboy would\nhave been less of a coxcomb. And the ladies have dissected me with their\nside-glances and their satirical remarks. Every woman has some care for\nher reputation, and you have wrecked mine.\n\n\"Oh, I am yours and no mistake! And I have not an excuse left but that\nof being faithful to you.--Monster that you are!\" she added, laughing,\nand allowing him to kiss her, \"you knew very well what you were doing!\nMadame Coquet, our chief clerk's wife, came to sit down by me, and\nadmired my lace. 'English point!' said she. 'Was it very expensive,\nmadame?'--'I do not know. This lace was my mother's. I am not rich\nenough to buy the like,' said I.\"\n\nMadame Marneffe, in short, had so bewitched the old beau, that he really\nbelieved she was sinning for the first time for his sake, and that he\nhad inspired such a passion as had led her to this breach of duty. She\ntold him that the wretch Marneffe had neglected her after they had been\nthree days married, and for the most odious reasons. Since then she had\nlived as innocently as a girl; marriage had seemed to her so horrible.\nThis was the cause of her present melancholy.\n\n\"If love should prove to be like marriage----\" said she in tears.\n\nThese insinuating lies, with which almost every woman in Valerie's\npredicament is ready, gave the Baron distant visions of the roses of\nthe seventh heaven. And so Valerie coquetted with her lover, while\nthe artist and Hortense were impatiently awaiting the moment when the\nBaroness should have given the girl her last kiss and blessing.\n\nAt seven in the morning the Baron, perfectly happy--for his Valerie\nwas at once the most guileless of girls and the most consummate of\ndemons--went back to release his son and Celestine from their duties.\nAll the dancers, for the most part strangers, had taken possession of\nthe territory, as they do at every wedding-ball, and were keeping up\nthe endless figures of the cotillions, while the gamblers were still\ncrowding round the _bouillotte_ tables, and old Crevel had won six\nthousand francs.\n\nThe morning papers, carried round the town, contained this paragraph in\nthe Paris article:--\n\n  \"The marriage was celebrated this morning, at the Church of\n  Saint-Thomas d'Aquin, between Monsieur le Comte Steinbock and\n  Mademoiselle Hortense Hulot, daughter of Baron Hulot d'Ervy,\n  Councillor of State, and a Director at the War Office; niece of\n  the famous General Comte de Forzheim. The ceremony attracted a\n  large gathering. There were present some of the most distinguished\n  artists of the day: Leon de Lora, Joseph Bridau, Stidmann, and\n  Bixiou; the magnates of the War Office, of the Council of State,\n  and many members of the two Chambers; also the most distinguished\n  of the Polish exiles living in Paris: Counts Paz, Laginski, and\n  others.\n\n  \"Monsieur le Comte Wenceslas Steinbock is grandnephew to the\n  famous general who served under Charles XII., King of Sweden. The\n  young Count, having taken part in the Polish rebellion, found a\n  refuge in France, where his well-earned fame as a sculptor has\n  procured him a patent of naturalization.\"\n\nAnd so, in spite of the Baron's cruel lack of money, nothing was lacking\nthat public opinion could require, not even the trumpeting of the\nnewspapers over his daughter's marriage, which was solemnized in the\nsame way, in every particular, as his son's had been to Mademoiselle\nCrevel. This display moderated the reports current as to the Baron's\nfinancial position, while the fortune assigned to his daughter explained\nthe need for having borrowed money.\n\nHere ends what is, in a way, the introduction to this story. It is to\nthe drama that follows that the premise is to a syllogism, what the\nprologue is to a classical tragedy.\n\n\n\nIn Paris, when a woman determines to make a business, a trade, of\nher beauty, it does not follow that she will make a fortune. Lovely\ncreatures may be found there, and full of wit, who are in wretched\ncircumstances, ending in misery a life begun in pleasure. And this is\nwhy. It is not enough merely to accept the shameful life of a courtesan\nwith a view to earning its profits, and at the same time to bear the\nsimple garb of a respectable middle-class wife. Vice does not triumph so\neasily; it resembles genius in so far that they both need a concurrence\nof favorable conditions to develop the coalition of fortune and gifts.\nEliminate the strange prologue of the Revolution, and the Emperor would\nnever have existed; he would have been no more than a second edition of\nFabert. Venal beauty, if it finds no amateurs, no celebrity, no cross\nof dishonor earned by squandering men's fortunes, is Correggio in a\nhay-loft, is genius starving in a garret. Lais, in Paris, must first and\nforemost find a rich man mad enough to pay her price. She must keep up a\nvery elegant style, for this is her shop-sign; she must be sufficiently\nwell bred to flatter the vanity of her lovers; she must have the\nbrilliant wit of a Sophie Arnould, which diverts the apathy of rich men;\nfinally, she must arouse the passions of libertines by appearing to be\nmistress to one man only who is envied by the rest.\n\nThese conditions, which a woman of that class calls being in luck, are\ndifficult to combine in Paris, although it is a city of millionaires, of\nidlers, of used-up and capricious men.\n\nProvidence has, no doubt, vouchsafed protection to clerks and\nmiddle-class citizens, for whom obstacles of this kind are at least\ndouble in the sphere in which they move. At the same time, there are\nenough Madame Marneffes in Paris to allow of our taking Valerie to\nfigure as a type in this picture of manners. Some of these women yield\nto the double pressure of a genuine passion and of hard necessity,\nlike Madame Colleville, who was for long attached to one of the famous\norators of the left, Keller the banker. Others are spurred by vanity,\nlike Madame de la Baudraye, who remained almost respectable in spite of\nher elopement with Lousteau. Some, again, are led astray by the love of\nfine clothes, and some by the impossibility of keeping a house going\non obviously too narrow means. The stinginess of the State--or of\nParliament--leads to many disasters and to much corruption.\n\nAt the present moment the laboring classes are the fashionable object\nof compassion; they are being murdered--it is said--by the manufacturing\ncapitalist; but the Government is a hundred times harder than the\nmeanest tradesman, it carries its economy in the article of salaries to\nabsolute folly. If you work harder, the merchant will pay you more in\nproportion; but what does the State do for its crowd of obscure and\ndevoted toilers?\n\nIn a married woman it is an inexcusable crime when she wanders from the\npath of honor; still, there are degrees even in such a case. Some\nwomen, far from being depraved, conceal their fall and remain to all\nappearances quite respectable, like those two just referred to, while\nothers add to their fault the disgrace of speculation. Thus Madame\nMarneffe is, as it were, the type of those ambitious married courtesans\nwho from the first accept depravity with all its consequences, and\ndetermine to make a fortune while taking their pleasure, perfectly\nunscrupulous as to the means. But almost always a woman like Madame\nMarneffe has a husband who is her confederate and accomplice. These\nMachiavellis in petticoats are the most dangerous of the sisterhood; of\nevery evil class of Parisian woman, they are the worst.\n\nA mere courtesan--a Josepha, a Malaga, a Madame Schontz, a Jenny\nCadine--carries in her frank dishonor a warning signal as conspicuous as\nthe red lamp of a house of ill-fame or the flaring lights of a gambling\nhell. A man knows that they light him to his ruin.\n\nBut mealy-mouthed propriety, the semblance of virtue, the hypocritical\nways of a married woman who never allows anything to be seen but the\nvulgar needs of the household, and affects to refuse every kind of\nextravagance, leads to silent ruin, dumb disaster, which is all the more\nstartling because, though condoned, it remains unaccounted for. It is\nthe ignoble bill of daily expenses and not gay dissipation that devours\nthe largest fortune. The father of a family ruins himself ingloriously,\nand the great consolation of gratified vanity is wanting in his misery.\n\nThis little sermon will go like a javelin to the heart of many a home.\nMadame Marneffes are to be seen in every sphere of social life, even at\nCourt; for Valerie is a melancholy fact, modeled from the life in the\nsmallest details. And, alas! the portrait will not cure any man of the\nfolly of loving these sweetly-smiling angels, with pensive looks and\ncandid faces, whose heart is a cash-box.\n\n\n\nAbout three years after Hortense's marriage, in 1841, Baron Hulot d'Ervy\nwas supposed to have sown his wild oats, to have \"put up his horses,\"\nto quote the expression used by Louis XV.'s head surgeon, and yet Madame\nMarneffe was costing him twice as much as Josepha had ever cost him.\nStill, Valerie, though always nicely dressed, affected the simplicity\nof a subordinate official's wife; she kept her luxury for her\ndressing-gowns, her home wear. She thus sacrificed her Parisian vanity\nto her dear Hector. At the theatre, however, she always appeared in a\npretty bonnet and a dress of extreme elegance; and the Baron took her in\na carriage to a private box.\n\nHer rooms, the whole of the second floor of a modern house in the\nRue Vanneau, between a fore-court and a garden, was redolent of\nrespectability. All its luxury was in good chintz hangings and handsome\nconvenient furniture.\n\nHer bedroom, indeed, was the exception, and rich with such profusion\nas Jenny Cadine or Madame Schontz might have displayed. There were\nlace curtains, cashmere hangings, brocade portieres, a set of chimney\nornaments modeled by Stidmann, a glass cabinet filled with dainty\nnicknacks. Hulot could not bear to see his Valerie in a bower of\ninferior magnificence to the dunghill of gold and pearls owned by\na Josepha. The drawing-room was furnished with red damask, and the\ndining-room had carved oak panels. But the Baron, carried away by his\nwish to have everything in keeping, had at the end of six months,\nadded solid luxury to mere fashion, and had given her handsome portable\nproperty, as, for instance, a service of plate that was to cost more\nthan twenty-four thousand francs.\n\nMadame Marneffe's house had in a couple of years achieved a reputation\nfor being a very pleasant one. Gambling went on there. Valerie herself\nwas soon spoken of as an agreeable and witty woman. To account for her\nchange of style, a rumor was set going of an immense legacy bequeathed\nto her by her \"natural father,\" Marshal Montcornet, and left in trust.\n\nWith an eye to the future, Valerie had added religious to social\nhypocrisy. Punctual at the Sunday services, she enjoyed all the honors\ndue to the pious. She carried the bag for the offertory, she was a\nmember of a charitable association, presented bread for the sacrament,\nand did some good among the poor, all at Hector's expense. Thus\neverything about the house was extremely seemly. And a great many\npersons maintained that her friendship with the Baron was entirely\ninnocent, supporting the view by the gentleman's mature age, and\nascribing to him a Platonic liking for Madame Marneffe's pleasant wit,\ncharming manners, and conversation--such a liking as that of the late\nlamented Louis XVIII. for a well-turned note.\n\nThe Baron always withdrew with the other company at about midnight, and\ncame back a quarter of an hour later.\n\nThe secret of this secrecy was as follows. The lodge-keepers of the\nhouse were a Monsieur and Madame Olivier, who, under the Baron's\npatronage, had been promoted from their humble and not very lucrative\npost in the Rue du Doyenne to the highly-paid and handsome one in\nthe Rue Vanneau. Now, Madame Olivier, formerly a needlewoman in the\nhousehold of Charles X., who had fallen in the world with the legitimate\nbranch, had three children. The eldest, an under-clerk in a notary's\noffice, was object of his parents' adoration. This Benjamin, for six\nyears in danger of being drawn for the army, was on the point of being\ninterrupted in his legal career, when Madame Marneffe contrived to have\nhim declared exempt for one of those little malformations which the\nExamining Board can always discern when requested in a whisper by some\npower in the ministry. So Olivier, formerly a huntsman to the King, and\nhis wife would have crucified the Lord again for the Baron or for Madame\nMarneffe.\n\nWhat could the world have to say? It knew nothing of the former episode\nof the Brazilian, Monsieur Montes de Montejanos--it could say nothing.\nBesides, the world is very indulgent to the mistress of a house where\namusement is to be found.\n\nAnd then to all her charms Valerie added the highly-prized advantage\nof being an occult power. Claude Vignon, now secretary to Marshal the\nPrince de Wissembourg, and dreaming of promotion to the Council of State\nas a Master of Appeals, was constantly seen in her rooms, to which came\nalso some Deputies--good fellows and gamblers. Madame Marneffe had got\nher circle together with prudent deliberation; only men whose opinions\nand habits agreed foregathered there, men whose interest it was to\nhold together and to proclaim the many merits of the lady of the house.\nScandal is the true Holy Alliance in Paris. Take that as an axiom.\nInterests invariably fall asunder in the end; vicious natures can always\nagree.\n\nWithin three months of settling in the Rue Vanneau, Madame Marneffe\nhad entertained Monsieur Crevel, who by that time was Mayor of his\n_arrondissement_ and Officer of the Legion of Honor. Crevel had\nhesitated; he would have to give up the famous uniform of the National\nGuard in which he strutted at the Tuileries, believing himself quite\nas much a soldier as the Emperor himself; but ambition, urged by Madame\nMarneffe, had proved stronger than vanity. Then Monsieur le Maire had\nconsidered his connection with Mademoiselle Heloise Brisetout as quite\nincompatible with his political position.\n\nIndeed, long before his accession to the civic chair of the Mayoralty,\nhis gallant intimacies had been wrapped in the deepest mystery. But,\nas the reader may have guessed, Crevel had soon purchased the right of\ntaking his revenge, as often as circumstances allowed, for having been\nbereft of Josepha, at the cost of a bond bearing six thousand francs of\ninterest in the name of Valerie Fortin, wife of Sieur Marneffe, for her\nsole and separate use. Valerie, inheriting perhaps from her mother the\nspecial acumen of the kept woman, read the character of her grotesque\nadorer at a glance. The phrase \"I never had a lady for a mistress,\"\nspoken by Crevel to Lisbeth, and repeated by Lisbeth to her dear\nValerie, had been handsomely discounted in the bargain by which she got\nher six thousand francs a year in five per cents. And since then she had\nnever allowed her prestige to grow less in the eyes of Cesar Birotteau's\nerewhile bagman.\n\nCrevel himself had married for money the daughter of a miller of la\nBrie, an only child indeed, whose inheritance constituted three-quarters\nof his fortune; for when retail-dealers grow rich, it is generally not\nso much by trade as through some alliance between the shop and rural\nthrift. A large proportion of the farmers, corn-factors, dairy-keepers,\nand market-gardeners in the neighborhood of Paris, dream of the glories\nof the desk for their daughters, and look upon a shopkeeper, a jeweler,\nor a money-changer as a son-in-law after their own heart, in preference\nto a notary or an attorney, whose superior social position is a ground\nof suspicion; they are afraid of being scorned in the future by these\ncitizen bigwigs.\n\nMadame Crevel, ugly, vulgar, and silly, had given her husband no\npleasures but those of paternity; she died young. Her libertine husband,\nfettered at the beginning of his commercial career by the necessity\nfor working, and held in thrall by want of money, had led the life of\nTantalus. Thrown in--as he phrased it--with the most elegant women in\nParis, he let them out of the shop with servile homage, while admiring\ntheir grace, their way of wearing the fashions, and all the nameless\ncharms of what is called breeding. To rise to the level of one of these\nfairies of the drawing-room was a desire formed in his youth, but buried\nin the depths of his heart. Thus to win the favors of Madame Marneffe\nwas to him not merely the realization of his chimera, but, as has been\nshown, a point of pride, of vanity, of self-satisfaction. His ambition\ngrew with success; his brain was turned with elation; and when the\nmind is captivated, the heart feels more keenly, every gratification is\ndoubled.\n\nAlso, it must be said that Madame Marneffe offered to Crevel a\nrefinement of pleasure of which he had no idea; neither Josepha nor\nHeloise had loved him; and Madame Marneffe thought it necessary\nto deceive him thoroughly, for this man, she saw, would prove an\ninexhaustible till. The deceptions of a venal passion are more\ndelightful than the real thing. True love is mixed up with birdlike\nsquabbles, in which the disputants wound each other to the quick; but a\nquarrel without animus is, on the contrary, a piece of flattery to the\ndupe's conceit.\n\nThe rare interviews granted to Crevel kept his passion at white heat.\nHe was constantly blocked by Valerie's virtuous severity; she acted\nremorse, and wondered what her father must be thinking of her in the\nparadise of the brave. Again and again he had to contend with a sort\nof coldness, which the cunning slut made him believe he had overcome\nby seeming to surrender to the man's crazy passion; and then, as if\nashamed, she entrenched herself once more in her pride of respectability\nand airs of virtue, just like an Englishwoman, neither more nor less;\nand she always crushed her Crevel under the weight of her dignity--for\nCrevel had, in the first instance, swallowed her pretensions to virtue.\n\nIn short, Valerie had special veins of affections which made her equally\nindispensable to Crevel and to the Baron. Before the world she\ndisplayed the attractive combination of modest and pensive innocence,\nof irreproachable propriety, with a bright humor enhanced by the\nsuppleness, the grace and softness of the Creole; but in a _tete-a-tete_\nshe would outdo any courtesan; she was audacious, amusing, and full of\noriginal inventiveness. Such a contrast is irresistible to a man of the\nCrevel type; he is flattered by believing himself sole author of the\ncomedy, thinking it is performed for his benefit alone, and he laughs at\nthe exquisite hypocrisy while admiring the hypocrite.\n\nValerie had taken entire possession of Baron Hulot; she had persuaded\nhim to grow old by one of those subtle touches of flattery which reveal\nthe diabolical wit of women like her. In all evergreen constitutions a\nmoment arrives when the truth suddenly comes out, as in a besieged\ntown which puts a good face on affairs as long as possible. Valerie,\nforeseeing the approaching collapse of the old beau of the Empire,\ndetermined to forestall it.\n\n\"Why give yourself so much bother, my dear old veteran?\" said she one\nday, six months after their doubly adulterous union. \"Do you want to be\nflirting? To be unfaithful to me? I assure you, I should like you better\nwithout your make-up. Oblige me by giving up all your artificial charms.\nDo you suppose that it is for two sous' worth of polish on your boots\nthat I love you? For your india-rubber belt, your strait-waistcoat,\nand your false hair? And then, the older you look, the less need I fear\nseeing my Hulot carried off by a rival.\"\n\nAnd Hulot, trusting to Madame Marneffe's heavenly friendship as much as\nto her love, intending, too, to end his days with her, had taken this\nconfidential hint, and ceased to dye his whiskers and hair. After\nthis touching declaration from his Valerie, handsome Hector made his\nappearance one morning perfectly white. Madame Marneffe could assure him\nthat she had a hundred times detected the white line of the growth of\nthe hair.\n\n\"And white hair suits your face to perfection,\" said she; \"it softens\nit. You look a thousand times better, quite charming.\"\n\nThe Baron, once started on this path of reform, gave up his leather\nwaistcoat and stays; he threw off all his bracing. His stomach fell\nand increased in size. The oak became a tower, and the heaviness of his\nmovements was all the more alarming because the Baron grew immensely\nolder by playing the part of Louis XII. His eyebrows were still black,\nand left a ghostly reminiscence of Handsome Hulot, as sometimes on the\nwall of some feudal building a faint trace of sculpture remains to show\nwhat the castle was in the days of its glory. This discordant detail\nmade his eyes, still bright and youthful, all the more remarkable in his\ntanned face, because it had so long been ruddy with the florid hues of\na Rubens; and now a certain discoloration and the deep tension of the\nwrinkles betrayed the efforts of a passion at odds with natural decay.\nHulot was now one of those stalwart ruins in which virile force asserts\nitself by tufts of hair in the ears and nostrils and on the fingers, as\nmoss grows on the almost eternal monuments of the Roman Empire.\n\nHow had Valerie contrived to keep Crevel and Hulot side by side, each\ntied to an apron-string, when the vindictive Mayor only longed to\ntriumph openly over Hulot? Without immediately giving an answer to this\nquestion, which the course of the story will supply, it may be said that\nLisbeth and Valerie had contrived a powerful piece of machinery which\ntended to this result. Marneffe, as he saw his wife improved in beauty\nby the setting in which she was enthroned, like the sun at the centre of\nthe sidereal system, appeared, in the eyes of the world, to have fallen\nin love with her again himself; he was quite crazy about her. Now,\nthough his jealousy made him somewhat of a marplot, it gave enhanced\nvalue to Valerie's favors. Marneffe meanwhile showed a blind confidence\nin his chief, which degenerated into ridiculous complaisance. The only\nperson whom he really would not stand was Crevel.\n\nMarneffe, wrecked by the debauchery of great cities, described by Roman\nauthors, though modern decency has no name for it, was as hideous as\nan anatomical figure in wax. But this disease on feet, clothed in good\nbroadcloth, encased his lathlike legs in elegant trousers. The hollow\nchest was scented with fine linen, and musk disguised the odors of\nrotten humanity. This hideous specimen of decaying vice, trotting in red\nheels--for Valerie dressed the man as beseemed his income, his cross,\nand his appointment--horrified Crevel, who could not meet the colorless\neyes of the Government clerk. Marneffe was an incubus to the Mayor. And\nthe mean rascal, aware of the strange power conferred on him by Lisbeth\nand his wife, was amused by it; he played on it as on an instrument; and\ncards being the last resource of a mind as completely played out as\nthe body, he plucked Crevel again and again, the Mayor thinking himself\nbound to subserviency to the worthy official whom _he was cheating_.\n\nSeeing Crevel a mere child in the hands of that hideous and atrocious\nmummy, of whose utter vileness the Mayor knew nothing; and seeing him,\nyet more, an object of deep contempt to Valerie, who made game of Crevel\nas of some mountebank, the Baron apparently thought him so impossible as\na rival that he constantly invited him to dinner.\n\nValerie, protected by two lovers on guard, and by a jealous husband,\nattracted every eye, and excited every desire in the circle she shone\nupon. And thus, while keeping up appearances, she had, in the course\nof three years, achieved the most difficult conditions of the success a\ncourtesan most cares for and most rarely attains, even with the help\nof audacity and the glitter of an existence in the light of the sun.\nValerie's beauty, formerly buried in the mud of the Rue du Doyenne, now,\nlike a well-cut diamond exquisitely set by Chanor, was worth more than\nits real value--it could break hearts. Claude Vignon adored Valerie in\nsecret.\n\n\n\nThis retrospective explanation, quite necessary after the lapse of\nthree years, shows Valerie's balance-sheet. Now for that of her partner,\nLisbeth.\n\nLisbeth Fischer filled the place in the Marneffe household of a relation\nwho combines the functions of a lady companion and a housekeeper; but\nshe suffered from none of the humiliations which, for the most part,\nweigh upon the women who are so unhappy as to be obliged to fill these\nambiguous situations. Lisbeth and Valerie offered the touching spectacle\nof one of those friendships between women, so cordial and so improbable,\nthat men, always too keen-tongued in Paris, forthwith slander them. The\ncontrast between Lisbeth's dry masculine nature and Valerie's creole\nprettiness encouraged calumny. And Madame Marneffe had unconsciously\ngiven weight to the scandal by the care she took of her friend, with\nmatrimonial views, which were, as will be seen, to complete Lisbeth's\nrevenge.\n\nAn immense change had taken place in Cousin Betty; and Valerie, who\nwanted to smarten her, had turned it to the best account. The strange\nwoman had submitted to stays, and laced tightly, she used bandoline to\nkeep her hair smooth, wore her gowns as the dressmaker sent them home,\nneat little boots, and gray silk stockings, all of which were included\nin Valerie's bills, and paid for by the gentleman in possession. Thus\nfurbished up, and wearing the yellow cashmere shawl, Lisbeth would have\nbeen unrecognizable by any one who had not seen her for three years.\n\nThis other diamond--a black diamond, the rarest of all--cut by a skilled\nhand, and set as best became her, was appreciated at her full value by\ncertain ambitious clerks. Any one seeing her for the first time might\nhave shuddered involuntarily at the look of poetic wildness which the\nclever Valerie had succeeded in bringing out by the arts of dress in\nthis Bleeding Nun, framing the ascetic olive face in thick bands of\nhair as black as the fiery eyes, and making the most of the rigid, slim\nfigure. Lisbeth, like a Virgin by Cranach or Van Eyck, or a Byzantine\nMadonna stepped out of its frame, had all the stiffness, the precision\nof those mysterious figures, the more modern cousins of Isis and her\nsister goddesses sheathed in marble folds by Egyptian sculptors. It was\ngranite, basalt, porphyry, with life and movement.\n\nSaved from want for the rest of her life, Lisbeth was most amiable;\nwherever she dined she brought merriment. And the Baron paid the rent\nof her little apartment, furnished, as we know, with the leavings of her\nfriend Valerie's former boudoir and bedroom.\n\n\"I began,\" she would say, \"as a hungry nanny goat, and I am ending as a\n_lionne_.\"\n\nShe still worked for Monsieur Rivet at the more elaborate kinds of\ngold-trimming, merely, as she said, not to lose her time. At the\nsame time, she was, as we shall see, very full of business; but it is\ninherent in the nature of country-folks never to give up bread-winning;\nin this they are like the Jews.\n\nEvery morning, very early, Cousin Betty went off to market with the\ncook. It was part of Lisbeth's scheme that the house-book, which was\nruining Baron Hulot, was to enrich her dear Valerie--as it did indeed.\n\nIs there a housewife who, since 1838, has not suffered from the evil\neffects of Socialist doctrines diffused among the lower classes by\nincendiary writers? In every household the plague of servants is\nnowadays the worst of financial afflictions. With very few exceptions,\nwho ought to be rewarded with the Montyon prize, the cook, male or\nfemale, is a domestic robber, a thief taking wages, and perfectly\nbarefaced, with the Government for a fence, developing the tendency to\ndishonesty, which is almost authorized in the cook by the time-honored\njest as to the \"handle of the basket.\" The women who formerly picked up\ntheir forty sous to buy a lottery ticket now take fifty francs to put\ninto the savings bank. And the smug Puritans who amuse themselves in\nFrance with philanthropic experiments fancy that they are making the\ncommon people moral!\n\nBetween the market and the master's table the servants have their secret\ntoll, and the municipality of Paris is less sharp in collecting the\ncity-dues than the servants are in taking theirs on every single thing.\nTo say nothing of fifty per cent charged on every form of food, they\ndemand large New Year's premiums from the tradesmen. The best class of\ndealers tremble before this occult power, and subsidize it without a\nword--coachmakers, jewelers, tailors, and all. If any attempt is made\nto interfere with them, the servants reply with impudent retorts, or\nrevenge themselves by the costly blunders of assumed clumsiness; and in\nthese days they inquire into their master's character as, formerly, the\nmaster inquired into theirs. This mischief is now really at its height,\nand the law-courts are beginning to take cognizance of it; but in vain,\nfor it cannot be remedied but by a law which shall compel domestic\nservants, like laborers, to have a pass-book as a guarantee of conduct.\nThen the evil will vanish as if by magic. If every servant were obliged\nto show his pass-book, and if masters were required to state in it the\ncause of his dismissal, this would certainly prove a powerful check to\nthe evil.\n\nThe men who are giving their attentions to the politics of the day\nknow not to what lengths the depravity of the lower classes has gone.\nStatistics are silent as to the startling number of working men of\ntwenty who marry cooks of between forty and fifty enriched by robbery.\nWe shudder to think of the result of such unions from the three points\nof view of increasing crime, degeneracy of the race, and miserable\nhouseholds.\n\nAs to the mere financial mischief that results from domestic peculation,\nthat too is immense from a political point of view. Life being made to\ncost double, any superfluity becomes impossible in most households.\nNow superfluity means half the trade of the world, as it is half the\nelegance of life. Books and flowers are to many persons as necessary as\nbread.\n\nLisbeth, well aware of this dreadful scourge of Parisian households,\ndetermined to manage Valerie's, promising her every assistance in the\nterrible scene when the two women had sworn to be like sisters. So\nshe had brought from the depths of the Vosges a humble relation on her\nmother's side, a very pious and honest soul, who had been cook to the\nBishop of Nancy. Fearing, however, her inexperience of Paris ways, and\nyet more the evil counsel which wrecks such fragile virtue, at first\nLisbeth always went to market with Mathurine, and tried to teach\nher what to buy. To know the real prices of things and command the\nsalesman's respect; to purchase unnecessary delicacies, such as fish,\nonly when they were cheap; to be well informed as to the price current\nof groceries and provisions, so as to buy when prices are low in\nanticipation of a rise,--all this housekeeping skill is in Paris\nessential to domestic economy. As Mathurine got good wages and many\npresents, she liked the house well enough to be glad to drive good\nbargains. And by this time Lisbeth had made her quite a match for\nherself, sufficiently experienced and trustworthy to be sent to market\nalone, unless Valerie was giving a dinner--which, in fact, was not\nunfrequently the case. And this was how it came about.\n\nThe Baron had at first observed the strictest decorum; but his passion\nfor Madame Marneffe had ere long become so vehement, so greedy, that he\nwould never quit her if he could help it. At first he dined there four\ntimes a week; then he thought it delightful to dine with her every day.\nSix months after his daughter's marriage he was paying her two thousand\nfrancs a month for his board. Madame Marneffe invited any one her dear\nBaron wished to entertain. The dinner was always arranged for six; he\ncould bring in three unexpected guests. Lisbeth's economy enabled her\nto solve the extraordinary problem of keeping up the table in the best\nstyle for a thousand francs a month, giving the other thousand to Madame\nMarneffe. Valerie's dress being chiefly paid for by Crevel and the\nBaron, the two women saved another thousand francs a month on this.\n\nAnd so this pure and innocent being had already accumulated a hundred\nand fifty thousand francs in savings. She had capitalized her income\nand monthly bonus, and swelled the amount by enormous interest, due to\nCrevel's liberality in allowing his \"little Duchess\" to invest her money\nin partnership with him in his financial operations. Crevel had taught\nValerie the slang and the procedure of the money market, and, like every\nParisian woman, she had soon outstripped her master. Lisbeth, who never\nspent a sou of her twelve hundred francs, whose rent and dress were\ngiven to her, and who never put her hand in her pocket, had likewise\na small capital of five or six thousand francs, of which Crevel took\nfatherly care.\n\nAt the same time, two such lovers were a heavy burthen on Valerie.\nOn the day when this drama reopens, Valerie, spurred by one of those\nincidents which have the effect in life that the ringing of a bell has\nin inducing a swarm of bees to settle, went up to Lisbeth's rooms to\ngive vent to one of those comforting lamentations--a sort of cigarette\nblown off from the tongue--by which women alleviate the minor miseries\nof life.\n\n\"Oh, Lisbeth, my love, two hours of Crevel this morning! It is crushing!\nHow I wish I could send you in my place!\"\n\n\"That, unluckily, is impossible,\" said Lisbeth, smiling. \"I shall die a\nmaid.\"\n\n\"Two old men lovers! Really, I am ashamed sometimes! If my poor mother\ncould see me.\"\n\n\"You are mistaking me for Crevel!\" said Lisbeth.\n\n\"Tell me, my little Betty, do you not despise me?\"\n\n\"Oh! if I had but been pretty, what adventures I would have had!\" cried\nLisbeth. \"That is your justification.\"\n\n\"But you would have acted only at the dictates of your heart,\" said\nMadame Marneffe, with a sigh.\n\n\"Pooh! Marneffe is a dead man they have forgotten to bury,\" replied\nLisbeth. \"The Baron is as good as your husband; Crevel is your adorer;\nit seems to me that you are quite in order--like every other married\nwoman.\"\n\n\"No, it is not that, dear, adorable thing; that is not where the shoe\npinches; you do not choose to understand.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" said Lisbeth. \"The unexpressed factor is part of my\nrevenge; what can I do? I am working it out.\"\n\n\"I love Wenceslas so that I am positively growing thin, and I can never\nsee him,\" said Valerie, throwing up her arms. \"Hulot asks him to dinner,\nand my artist declines. He does not know that I idolize him, the wretch!\nWhat is his wife after all? Fine flesh! Yes, she is handsome, but I--I\nknow myself--I am worse!\"\n\n\"Be quite easy, my child, he will come,\" said Lisbeth, in the tone of a\nnurse to an impatient child. \"He shall.\"\n\n\"But when?\"\n\n\"This week perhaps.\"\n\n\"Give me a kiss.\"\n\nAs may be seen, these two women were but one. Everything Valerie did,\neven her most reckless actions, her pleasures, her little sulks, were\ndecided on after serious deliberation between them.\n\nLisbeth, strangely excited by this harlot existence, advised Valerie on\nevery step, and pursued her course of revenge with pitiless logic. She\nreally adored Valerie; she had taken her to be her child, her friend,\nher love; she found her docile, as Creoles are, yielding from voluptuous\nindolence; she chattered with her morning after morning with more\npleasure than with Wenceslas; they could laugh together over the\nmischief they plotted, and over the folly of men, and count up the\nswelling interest on their respective savings.\n\nIndeed, in this new enterprise and new affection, Lisbeth had found food\nfor her activity that was far more satisfying than her insane passion\nfor Wenceslas. The joys of gratified hatred are the fiercest and\nstrongest the heart can know. Love is the gold, hatred the iron of\nthe mine of feeling that lies buried in us. And then, Valerie was,\nto Lisbeth, Beauty in all its glory--the beauty she worshiped, as we\nworship what we have not, beauty far more plastic to her hand than that\nof Wenceslas, who had always been cold to her and distant.\n\nAt the end of nearly three years, Lisbeth was beginning to perceive the\nprogress of the underground mine on which she was expending her life and\nconcentrating her mind. Lisbeth planned, Madame Marneffe acted. Madame\nMarneffe was the axe, Lisbeth was the hand the wielded it, and that hand\nwas rapidly demolishing the family which was every day more odious\nto her; for we can hate more and more, just as, when we love, we love\nbetter every day.\n\nLove and hatred are feelings that feed on themselves; but of the two,\nhatred has the longer vitality. Love is restricted within limits of\npower; it derives its energies from life and from lavishness. Hatred\nis like death, like avarice; it is, so to speak, an active abstraction,\nabove beings and things.\n\nLisbeth, embarked on the existence that was natural to her, expended in\nit all her faculties; governing, like the Jesuits, by occult influences.\nThe regeneration of her person was equally complete; her face was\nradiant. Lisbeth dreamed of becoming Madame la Marechale Hulot.\n\nThis little scene, in which the two friends had bluntly uttered\ntheir ideas without any circumlocution in expressing them, took place\nimmediately on Lisbeth's return from market, whither she had been to\nprocure the materials for an elegant dinner. Marneffe, who hoped to get\nCoquet's place, was to entertain him and the virtuous Madame Coquet,\nand Valerie hoped to persuade Hulot, that very evening, to consider the\nhead-clerk's resignation.\n\nLisbeth dressed to go to the Baroness, with whom she was to dine.\n\n\"You will come back in time to make tea for us, my Betty?\" said Valerie.\n\n\"I hope so.\"\n\n\"You hope so--why? Have you come to sleeping with Adeline to drink her\ntears while she is asleep?\"\n\n\"If only I could!\" said Lisbeth, laughing. \"I would not refuse. She is\nexpiating her happiness--and I am glad, for I remember our young days.\nIt is my turn now. She will be in the mire, and I shall be Comtesse de\nForzheim!\"\n\nLisbeth set out for the Rue Plumet, where she now went as to the\ntheatre--to indulge her emotions.\n\n\n\nThe residence Hulot had found for his wife consisted of a large,\nbare entrance-room, a drawing-room, and a bed and dressing-room. The\ndining-room was next the drawing-room on one side. Two servants' rooms\nand a kitchen on the third floor completed the accommodation, which was\nnot unworthy of a Councillor of State, high up in the War Office. The\nhouse, the court-yard, and the stairs were extremely handsome.\n\nThe Baroness, who had to furnish her drawing-room, bed-room, and\ndining-room with the relics of her splendor, had brought away the best\nof the remains from the house in the Rue de l'Universite. Indeed, the\npoor woman was attached to these mute witnesses of her happier life;\nto her they had an almost consoling eloquence. In memory she saw her\nflowers, as in the carpets she could trace patterns hardly visible now\nto other eyes.\n\nOn going into the spacious anteroom, where twelve chairs, a barometer,\na large stove, and long, white cotton curtains, bordered with red,\nsuggested the dreadful waiting-room of a Government office, the visitor\nfelt oppressed, conscious at once of the isolation in which the mistress\nlived. Grief, like pleasure, infects the atmosphere. A first glance into\nany home is enough to tell you whether love or despair reigns there.\n\nAdeline would be found sitting in an immense bedroom with beautiful\nfurniture by Jacob Desmalters, of mahogany finished in the Empire style\nwith ormolu, which looks even less inviting than the brass-work of Louis\nXVI.! It gave one a shiver to see this lonely woman sitting on a Roman\nchair, a work-table with sphinxes before her, colorless, affecting false\ncheerfulness, but preserving her imperial air, as she had preserved\nthe blue velvet gown she always wore in the house. Her proud spirit\nsustained her strength and preserved her beauty.\n\nThe Baroness, by the end of her first year of banishment to this\napartment, had gauged every depth of misfortune.\n\n\"Still, even here my Hector has made my life much handsomer than it\nshould be for a mere peasant,\" said she to herself. \"He chooses that it\nshould be so; his will be done! I am Baroness Hulot, the sister-in-law\nof a Marshal of France. I have done nothing wrong; my two children are\nsettled in life; I can wait for death, wrapped in the spotless veil of\nan immaculate wife and the crape of departed happiness.\"\n\nA portrait of Hulot, in the uniform of a Commissary General of the\nImperial Guard, painted in 1810 by Robert Lefebvre, hung above the\nwork-table, and when visitors were announced, Adeline threw into\na drawer an _Imitation of Jesus Christ_, her habitual study. This\nblameless Magdalen thus heard the Voice of the Spirit in her desert.\n\n\"Mariette, my child,\" said Lisbeth to the woman who opened the door,\n\"how is my dear Adeline to-day?\"\n\n\"Oh, she looks pretty well, mademoiselle; but between you and me, if she\ngoes on in this way, she will kill herself,\" said Mariette in a whisper.\n\"You really ought to persuade her to live better. Now, yesterday madame\ntold me to give her two sous' worth of milk and a roll for one sou; to\nget her a herring for dinner and a bit of cold veal; she had a pound\ncooked to last her the week--of course, for the days when she dines\nat home and alone. She will not spend more than ten sous a day for her\nfood. It is unreasonable. If I were to say anything about it to Monsieur\nle Marechal, he might quarrel with Monsieur le Baron and leave him\nnothing, whereas you, who are so kind and clever, can manage things----\"\n\n\"But why do you not apply to my cousin the Baron?\" said Lisbeth.\n\n\"Oh, dear mademoiselle, he has not been here for three weeks or more; in\nfact, not since we last had the pleasure of seeing you! Besides, madame\nhas forbidden me, under threat of dismissal, ever to ask the master for\nmoney. But as for grief!--oh, poor lady, she has been very unhappy. It\nis the first time that monsieur has neglected her for so long. Every\ntime the bell rang she rushed to the window--but for the last five days\nshe has sat still in her chair. She reads. Whenever she goes out to see\nMadame la Comtesse, she says, 'Mariette, if monsieur comes in,' says\nshe, 'tell him I am at home, and send the porter to fetch me; he shall\nbe well paid for his trouble.'\"\n\n\"Poor soul!\" said Lisbeth; \"it goes to my heart. I speak of her to the\nBaron every day. What can I do? 'Yes,' says he, 'Betty, you are right;\nI am a wretch. My wife is an angel, and I am a monster! I will go\nto-morrow----' And he stays with Madame Marneffe. That woman is ruining\nhim, and he worships her; he lives only in her sight.--I do what I can;\nif I were not there, and if I had not Mathurine to depend upon, he would\nspend twice as much as he does; and as he has hardly any money in the\nworld, he would have blown his brains out by this time. And, I tell\nyou, Mariette, Adeline would die of her husband's death, I am perfectly\ncertain. At any rate, I pull to make both ends meet, and prevent my\ncousin from throwing too much money into the fire.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is what madame says, poor soul! She knows how much she owes\nyou,\" replied Mariette. \"She said she had judged you unjustly for many\nyears----\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Lisbeth. \"And did she say anything else?\"\n\n\"No, mademoiselle. If you wish to please her, talk to her about Monsieur\nle Baron; she envies you your happiness in seeing him every day.\"\n\n\"Is she alone?\"\n\n\"I beg pardon, no; the Marshal is with her. He comes every day, and she\nalways tells him she saw monsieur in the morning, but that he comes in\nvery late at night.\"\n\n\"And is there a good dinner to-day?\"\n\nMariette hesitated; she could not meet Lisbeth's eye. The drawing-room\ndoor opened, and Marshal Hulot rushed out in such haste that he bowed to\nLisbeth without looking at her, and dropped a paper. Lisbeth picked it\nup and ran after him downstairs, for it was vain to hail a deaf man; but\nshe managed not to overtake the Marshal, and as she came up again she\nfurtively read the following lines written in pencil:--\n\n  \"MY DEAR BROTHER,--My husband has given me the money for my\n  quarter's expenses; but my daughter Hortense was in such need of\n  it, that I lent her the whole sum, which was scarcely enough to\n  set her straight. Could you lend me a few hundred francs? For I\n  cannot ask Hector for more; if he were to blame me, I could not\n  bear it.\"\n\n\"My word!\" thought Lisbeth, \"she must be in extremities to bend her\npride to such a degree!\"\n\nLisbeth went in. She saw tears in Adeline's eyes, and threw her arms\nround her neck.\n\n\"Adeline, my dearest, I know all,\" cried Cousin Betty. \"Here, the\nMarshal dropped this paper--he was in such a state of mind, and\nrunning like a greyhound.--Has that dreadful Hector given you no money\nsince----?\"\n\n\"He gives it me quite regularly,\" replied the Baroness, \"but Hortense\nneeded it, and--\"\n\n\"And you had not enough to pay for dinner to-night,\" said Lisbeth,\ninterrupting her. \"Now I understand why Mariette looked so confused when\nI said something about the soup. You really are childish, Adeline; come,\ntake my savings.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my kind cousin,\" said Adeline, wiping away a tear. \"This\nlittle difficulty is only temporary, and I have provided for the future.\nMy expenses henceforth will be no more than two thousand four hundred\nfrancs a year, rent inclusive, and I shall have the money.--Above all,\nBetty, not a word to Hector. Is he well?\"\n\n\"As strong as the Pont Neuf, and as gay as a lark; he thinks of nothing\nbut his charmer Valerie.\"\n\nMadame Hulot looked out at a tall silver-fir in front of the window, and\nLisbeth could not see her cousin's eyes to read their expression.\n\n\"Did you mention that it was the day when we all dine together here?\"\n\n\"Yes. But, dear me! Madame Marneffe is giving a grand dinner; she\nhopes to get Monsieur Coquet to resign, and that is of the first\nimportance.--Now, Adeline, listen to me. You know that I am fiercely\nproud as to my independence. Your husband, my dear, will certainly bring\nyou to ruin. I fancied I could be of use to you all by living near this\nwoman, but she is a creature of unfathomable depravity, and she will\nmake your husband promise things which will bring you all to disgrace.\"\nAdeline writhed like a person stabbed to the heart. \"My dear Adeline, I\nam sure of what I say. I feel it is my duty to enlighten you.--Well, let\nus think of the future. The Marshal is an old man, but he will last a\nlong time yet--he draws good pay; when he dies his widow would have a\npension of six thousand francs. On such an income I would undertake to\nmaintain you all. Use your influence over the good man to get him to\nmarry me. It is not for the sake of being Madame la Marechale; I value\nsuch nonsense at no more than I value Madame Marneffe's conscience; but\nyou will all have bread. I see that Hortense must be wanting it, since\nyou give her yours.\"\n\nThe Marshal now came in; he had made such haste, that he was mopping his\nforehead with his bandana.\n\n\"I have given Mariette two thousand francs,\" he whispered to his\nsister-in-law.\n\nAdeline colored to the roots of her hair. Two tears hung on the fringes\nof the still long lashes, and she silently pressed the old man's hand;\nhis beaming face expressed the glee of a favored lover.\n\n\"I intended to spend the money in a present for you, Adeline,\" said\nhe. \"Instead of repaying me, you must choose for yourself the thing you\nwould like best.\"\n\nHe took Lisbeth's hand, which she held out to him, and so bewildered was\nhe by his satisfaction, that he kissed it.\n\n\"That looks promising,\" said Adeline to Lisbeth, smiling so far as she\nwas able to smile.\n\nThe younger Hulot and his wife now came in.\n\n\"Is my brother coming to dinner?\" asked the Marshal sharply.\n\nAdeline took up a pencil and wrote these words on a scrap of paper:\n\n\"I expect him; he promised this morning that he would be here; but if\nhe should not come, it would be because the Marshal kept him. He is\noverwhelmed with business.\"\n\nAnd she handed him the paper. She had invented this way of conversing\nwith Marshal Hulot, and kept a little collection of paper scraps and a\npencil at hand on the work-table.\n\n\"I know,\" said the Marshal, \"he is worked very hard over the business in\nAlgiers.\"\n\nAt this moment, Hortense and Wenceslas arrived, and the Baroness, as\nshe saw all her family about her, gave the Marshal a significant glance\nunderstood by none but Lisbeth.\n\nHappiness had greatly improved the artist, who was adored by his wife\nand flattered by the world. His face had become almost round, and his\ngraceful figure did justice to the advantages which blood gives to men\nof birth. His early fame, his important position, the delusive eulogies\nthat the world sheds on artists as lightly as we say, \"How d'ye do?\" or\ndiscuss the weather, gave him that high sense of merit which degenerates\ninto sheer fatuity when talent wanes. The Cross of the Legion of Honor\nwas the crowning stamp of the great man he believed himself to be.\n\nAfter three years of married life, Hortense was to her husband what a\ndog is to its master; she watched his every movement with a look that\nseemed a constant inquiry, her eyes were always on him, like those of\na miser on his treasure; her admiring abnegation was quite pathetic. In\nher might be seen her mother's spirit and teaching. Her beauty, as\ngreat as ever, was poetically touched by the gentle shadow of concealed\nmelancholy.\n\nOn seeing Hortense come in, it struck Lisbeth that some long-suppressed\ncomplaint was about to break through the thin veil of reticence.\nLisbeth, from the first days of the honeymoon, had been sure that this\ncouple had too small an income for so great a passion.\n\nHortense, as she embraced her mother, exchanged with her a few whispered\nphrases, heart to heart, of which the mystery was betrayed to Lisbeth by\ncertain shakes of the head.\n\n\"Adeline, like me, must work for her living,\" thought Cousin Betty. \"She\nshall be made to tell me what she will do! Those pretty fingers will\nknow at last, like mine, what it is to work because they must.\"\n\nAt six o'clock the family party went in to dinner. A place was laid for\nHector.\n\n\"Leave it so,\" said the Baroness to Mariette, \"monsieur sometimes comes\nin late.\"\n\n\"Oh, my father will certainly come,\" said Victorin to his mother. \"He\npromised me he would when we parted at the Chamber.\"\n\nLisbeth, like a spider in the middle of its net, gloated over all these\ncountenances. Having known Victorin and Hortense from their birth, their\nfaces were to her like panes of glass, through which she could read\ntheir young souls. Now, from certain stolen looks directed by Victorin\non his mother, she saw that some disaster was hanging over Adeline which\nVictorin hesitated to reveal. The famous young lawyer had some covert\nanxiety. His deep reverence for his mother was evident in the regret\nwith which he gazed at her.\n\nHortense was evidently absorbed in her own woes; for a fortnight past,\nas Lisbeth knew, she had been suffering the first uneasiness which want\nof money brings to honest souls, and to young wives on whom life\nhas hitherto smiled, and who conceal their alarms. Also Lisbeth had\nimmediately guessed that her mother had given her no money. Adeline's\ndelicacy had brought her so low as to use the fallacious excuses that\nnecessity suggests to borrowers.\n\nHortense's absence of mind, with her brother's and the Baroness' deep\ndejection, made the dinner a melancholy meal, especially with the added\nchill of the Marshal's utter deafness. Three persons gave a little life\nto the scene: Lisbeth, Celestine, and Wenceslas. Hortense's affection\nhad developed the artist's natural liveliness as a Pole, the somewhat\nswaggering vivacity and noisy high spirits that characterize these\nFrenchmen of the North. His frame of mind and the expression of his\nface showed plainly that he believed in himself, and that poor Hortense,\nfaithful to her mother's training, kept all domestic difficulties to\nherself.\n\n\"You must be content, at any rate,\" said Lisbeth to her young cousin, as\nthey rose from table, \"since your mother has helped you with her money.\"\n\n\"Mamma!\" replied Hortense in astonishment. \"Oh, poor mamma! It is for me\nthat she would like to make money. You do not know, Lisbeth, but I have\na horrible suspicion that she works for it in secret.\"\n\nThey were crossing the large, dark drawing-room where there were\nno candles, all following Mariette, who was carrying the lamp into\nAdeline's bedroom. At this instant Victorin just touched Lisbeth\nand Hortense on the arm. The two women, understanding the hint, left\nWenceslas, Celestine, the Marshal, and the Baroness to go on together,\nand remained standing in a window-bay.\n\n\"What is it, Victorin?\" said Lisbeth. \"Some disaster caused by your\nfather, I dare wager.\"\n\n\"Yes, alas!\" replied Victorin. \"A money-lender named Vauvinet has bills\nof my father's to the amount of sixty thousand francs, and wants to\nprosecute. I tried to speak of the matter to my father at the Chamber,\nbut he would not understand me; he almost avoided me. Had we better tell\nmy mother?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Lisbeth, \"she has too many troubles; it would be a\ndeath-blow; you must spare her. You have no idea how low she has fallen.\nBut for your uncle, you would have found no dinner here this evening.\"\n\n\"Dear Heaven! Victorin, what wretches we are!\" said Hortense to her\nbrother. \"We ought to have guessed what Lisbeth has told us. My dinner\nis choking me!\"\n\nHortense could say no more; she covered her mouth with her handkerchief\nto smother a sob, and melted into tears.\n\n\"I told the fellow Vauvinet to call on me to-morrow,\" replied Victorin,\n\"but will he be satisfied by my guarantee on a mortgage? I doubt it.\nThose men insist on ready money to sweat others on usurious terms.\"\n\n\"Let us sell out of the funds!\" said Lisbeth to Hortense.\n\n\"What good would that do?\" replied Victorin. \"It would bring fifteen or\nsixteen thousand francs, and we want sixty thousand.\"\n\n\"Dear cousin!\" cried Hortense, embracing Lisbeth with the enthusiasm of\nguilelessness.\n\n\"No, Lisbeth, keep your little fortune,\" said Victorin, pressing the old\nmaid's hand. \"I shall see to-morrow what this man would be up to.\nWith my wife's consent, I can at least hinder or postpone the\nprosecution--for it would really be frightful to see my father's honor\nimpugned. What would the War Minister say? My father's salary, which\nhe pledged for three years, will not be released before the month of\nDecember, so we cannot offer that as a guarantee. This Vauvinet has\nrenewed the bills eleven times; so you may imagine what my father must\npay in interest. We must close this pit.\"\n\n\"If only Madame Marneffe would throw him over!\" said Hortense bitterly.\n\n\"Heaven forbid!\" exclaimed Victorin. \"He would take up some one else;\nand with her, at any rate, the worst outlay is over.\"\n\nWhat a change in children formerly so respectful, and kept so long by\ntheir mother in blind worship of their father! They knew him now for\nwhat he was.\n\n\"But for me,\" said Lisbeth, \"your father's ruin would be more complete\nthan it is.\"\n\n\"Come in to mamma,\" said Hortense; \"she is very sharp, and will suspect\nsomething; as our kind Lisbeth says, let us keep everything from\nher--let us be cheerful.\"\n\n\"Victorin,\" said Lisbeth, \"you have no notion of what your father\nwill be brought to by his passion for women. Try to secure some future\nresource by getting the Marshal to marry me. Say something about it this\nevening; I will leave early on purpose.\"\n\nVictorin went into the bedroom.\n\n\"And you, poor little thing!\" said Lisbeth in an undertone to Hortense,\n\"what can you do?\"\n\n\"Come to dinner with us to-morrow, and we will talk it over,\" answered\nHortense. \"I do not know which way to turn; you know how hard life is,\nand you will advise me.\"\n\n\n\nWhile the whole family with one consent tried to persuade the Marshal to\nmarry, and while Lisbeth was making her way home to the Rue Vanneau, one\nof those incidents occurred which, in such women as Madame Marneffe, are\na stimulus to vice by compelling them to exert their energy and\nevery resource of depravity. One fact, at any rate, must however be\nacknowledged: life in Paris is too full for vicious persons to do wrong\ninstinctively and unprovoked; vice is only a weapon of defence against\naggressors--that is all.\n\nMadame Marneffe's drawing-room was full of her faithful admirers, and\nshe had just started the whist-tables, when the footman, a pensioned\nsoldier recruited by the Baron, announced:\n\n\"Monsieur le Baron Montes de Montejanos.\"\n\nValerie's heart jumped, but she hurried to the door, exclaiming:\n\n\"My cousin!\" and as she met the Brazilian, she whispered:\n\n\"You are my relation--or all is at an end between us!--And so you were\nnot wrecked, Henri?\" she went on audibly, as she led him to the fire. \"I\nheard you were lost, and have mourned for you these three years.\"\n\n\"How are you, my good fellow?\" said Marneffe, offering his hand to the\nstranger, whose get-up was indeed that of a Brazilian and a millionaire.\n\nMonsieur le Baron Henri Montes de Montejanos, to whom the climate of the\nequator had given the color and stature we expect to see in Othello on\nthe stage, had an alarming look of gloom, but it was a merely pictorial\nillusion; for, sweet and affectionate by nature, he was predestined\nto be the victim that a strong man often is to a weak woman. The scorn\nexpressed in his countenance, the muscular strength of his stalwart\nframe, all his physical powers were shown only to his fellow-men; a form\nof flattery which women appreciate, nay, which so intoxicates them, that\nevery man with his mistress on his arm assumes a matador swagger that\nprovokes a smile. Very well set up, in a closely fitting blue coat with\nsolid gold buttons, in black trousers, spotless patent evening boots,\nand gloves of a fashionable hue, the only Brazilian touch in the Baron's\ncostume was a large diamond, worth about a hundred thousand francs,\nwhich blazed like a star on a handsome blue silk cravat, tucked into a\nwhite waistcoat in such a way as to show corners of a fabulously fine\nshirt front.\n\nHis brow, bossy like that of a satyr, a sign of tenacity in his\npassions, was crowned by thick jet-black hair like a virgin forest, and\nunder it flashed a pair of hazel eyes, so wild looking as to suggest\nthat before his birth his mother must have been scared by a jaguar.\n\nThis fine specimen of the Portuguese race in Brazil took his stand with\nhis back to the fire, in an attitude that showed familiarity with\nParis manners; holding his hat in one hand, his elbow resting on the\nvelvet-covered shelf, he bent over Madame Marneffe, talking to her in an\nundertone, and troubling himself very little about the dreadful people\nwho, in his opinion, were so very much in the way.\n\nThis fashion of taking the stage, with the Brazilian's attitude and\nexpression, gave, alike to Crevel and to the baron, an identical shock\nof curiosity and anxiety. Both were struck by the same impression and\nthe same surmise. And the manoeuvre suggested in each by their very\ngenuine passion was so comical in its simultaneous results, that it\nmade everybody smile who was sharp enough to read its meaning. Crevel,\na tradesman and shopkeeper to the backbone, though a mayor of Paris,\nunluckily, was a little slower to move than his rival partner, and\nthis enabled the Baron to read at a glance Crevel's involuntary\nself-betrayal. This was a fresh arrow to rankle in the very amorous old\nman's heart, and he resolved to have an explanation from Valerie.\n\n\"This evening,\" said Crevel to himself too, as he sorted his hand, \"I\nmust know where I stand.\"\n\n\"You have a heart!\" cried Marneffe. \"You have just revoked.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Crevel, trying to withdraw his card.--\"This\nBaron seems to me very much in the way,\" he went on, thinking to\nhimself. \"If Valerie carries on with my Baron, well and good--it is a\nmeans to my revenge, and I can get rid of him if I choose; but as for\nthis cousin!--He is one Baron too many; I do not mean to be made a fool\nof. I will know how they are related.\"\n\nThat evening, by one of those strokes of luck which come to pretty\nwomen, Valerie was charmingly dressed. Her white bosom gleamed under a\nlace tucker of rusty white, which showed off the satin texture of her\nbeautiful shoulders--for Parisian women, Heaven knows how, have some way\nof preserving their fine flesh and remaining slender. She wore a black\nvelvet gown that looked as if it might at any moment slip off her\nshoulders, and her hair was dressed with lace and drooping flowers. Her\narms, not fat but dimpled, were graced by deep ruffles to her sleeves.\nShe was like a luscious fruit coquettishly served in a handsome dish,\nand making the knife-blade long to be cutting it.\n\n\"Valerie,\" the Brazilian was saying in her ear, \"I have come back\nfaithful to you. My uncle is dead; I am twice as rich as I was when I\nwent away. I mean to live and die in Paris, for you and with you.\"\n\n\"Lower, Henri, I implore you----\"\n\n\"Pooh! I mean to speak to you this evening, even if I should have to\npitch all these creatures out of window, especially as I have lost two\ndays in looking for you. I shall stay till the last.--I can, I suppose?\"\n\nValerie smiled at her adopted cousin, and said:\n\n\"Remember that you are the son of my mother's sister, who married your\nfather during Junot's campaign in Portugal.\"\n\n\"What, I, Montes de Montejanos, great grandson of a conquerer of Brazil!\nTell a lie?\"\n\n\"Hush, lower, or we shall never meet again.\"\n\n\"Pray, why?\"\n\n\"Marneffe, like all dying wretches, who always take up some last whim,\nhas a revived passion for me----\"\n\n\"That cur?\" said the Brazilian, who knew his Marneffe; \"I will settle\nhim!\"\n\n\"What violence!\"\n\n\"And where did you get all this splendor?\" the Brazilian went on, just\nstruck by the magnificence of the apartment.\n\nShe began to laugh.\n\n\"Henri! what bad taste!\" said she.\n\nShe had felt two burning flashes of jealousy which had moved her so\nfar as to make her look at the two souls in purgatory. Crevel, playing\nagainst Baron Hulot and Monsieur Coquet, had Marneffe for his\npartner. The game was even, because Crevel and the Baron were equally\nabsent-minded, and made blunder after blunder. Thus, in one instant, the\nold men both confessed the passion which Valerie had persuaded them to\nkeep secret for the past three years; but she too had failed to hide\nthe joy in her eyes at seeing the man who had first taught her heart\nto beat, the object of her first love. The rights of such happy mortals\nsurvive as long as the woman lives over whom they have acquired them.\n\nWith these three passions at her side--one supported by the insolence of\nwealth, the second by the claims of possession, and the third by youth,\nstrength, fortune, and priority--Madame Marneffe preserved her coolness\nand presence of mind, like General Bonaparte when, at the siege of\nMantua, he had to fight two armies, and at the same time maintain the\nblockade.\n\nJealousy, distorting Hulot's face, made him look as terrible as the late\nMarshal Montcornet leading a cavalry charge against a Russian square.\nBeing such a handsome man, he had never known any ground for jealousy,\nany more than Murat knew what it was to be afraid. He had always felt\nsure that he should triumph. His rebuff by Josepha, the first he\nhad ever met, he ascribed to her love of money; \"he was conquered by\nmillions, and not by a changeling,\" he would say when speaking of the\nDuc d'Herouville. And now, in one instant, the poison and delirium\nthat the mad passion sheds in a flood had rushed to his heart. He kept\nturning from the whist-table towards the fireplace with an action _a la_\nMirabeau; and as he laid down his cards to cast a challenging glance\nat the Brazilian and Valerie, the rest of the company felt the sort of\nalarm mingled with curiosity that is caused by evident violence ready\nto break out at any moment. The sham cousin stared at Hulot as he might\nhave looked at some big China mandarin.\n\nThis state of things could not last; it was bound to end in some\ntremendous outbreak. Marneffe was as much afraid of Hulot as Crevel was\nof Marneffe, for he was anxious not to die a mere clerk. Men marked for\ndeath believe in life as galley-slaves believe in liberty; this man was\nbent on being a first-class clerk at any cost. Thoroughly frightened by\nthe pantomime of the Baron and Crevel, he rose, said a few words in\nhis wife's ear, and then, to the surprise of all, Valerie went into the\nadjoining bedroom with the Brazilian and her husband.\n\n\"Did Madame Marneffe ever speak to you of this cousin of hers?\" said\nCrevel to Hulot.\n\n\"Never!\" replied the Baron, getting up. \"That is enough for this\nevening,\" said he. \"I have lost two louis--there they are.\"\n\nHe threw the two gold pieces on the table, and seated himself on the\nsofa with a look which everybody else took as a hint to go. Monsieur and\nMadame Coquet, after exchanging a few words, left the room, and Claude\nVignon, in despair, followed their example. These two departures were\na hint to less intelligent persons, who now found that they were not\nwanted. The Baron and Crevel were left together, and spoke never a word.\nHulot, at last, ignoring Crevel, went on tiptoe to listen at the bedroom\ndoor; but he bounded back with a prodigious jump, for Marneffe opened\nthe door and appeared with a calm face, astonished to find only the two\nmen.\n\n\"And the tea?\" said he.\n\n\"Where is Valerie?\" replied the Baron in a rage.\n\n\"My wife,\" said Marneffe. \"She is gone upstairs to speak to mademoiselle\nyour cousin. She will come down directly.\"\n\n\"And why has she deserted us for that stupid creature?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Marneffe, \"Mademoiselle Lisbeth came back from dining with\nthe Baroness with an attack of indigestion and Mathurine asked Valerie\nfor some tea for her, so my wife went up to see what was the matter.\"\n\n\"And _her_ cousin?\"\n\n\"He is gone.\"\n\n\"Do you really believe that?\" said the Baron.\n\n\"I have seen him to his carriage,\" replied Marneffe, with a hideous\nsmirk.\n\nThe wheels of a departing carriage were audible in the street. The\nBaron, counting Marneffe for nothing, went upstairs to Lisbeth. An idea\nflashed through him such as the heart sends to the brain when it is on\nfire with jealousy. Marneffe's baseness was so well known to him, that\nhe could imagine the most degrading connivance between husband and wife.\n\n\"What has become of all the ladies and gentlemen?\" said Marneffe,\nfinding himself alone with Crevel.\n\n\"When the sun goes to bed, the cocks and hens follow suit,\" said Crevel.\n\"Madame Marneffe disappeared, and her adorers departed. Will you play a\ngame of piquet?\" added Crevel, who meant to remain.\n\nHe too believed that the Brazilian was in the house.\n\nMonsieur Marneffe agreed. The Mayor was a match for the Baron. Simply\nby playing cards with the husband he could stay on indefinitely;\nand Marneffe, since the suppression of the public tables, was quite\nsatisfied with the more limited opportunities of private play.\n\nBaron Hulot went quickly up to Lisbeth's apartment, but the door was\nlocked, and the usual inquiries through the door took up time enough to\nenable the two light-handed and cunning women to arrange the scene of an\nattack of indigestion with the accessories of tea. Lisbeth was in such\npain that Valerie was very much alarmed, and consequently hardly paid\nany heed to the Baron's furious entrance. Indisposition is one of the\nscreens most often placed by women to ward off a quarrel. Hulot peeped\nabout, here and there, but could see no spot in Cousin Betty's room\nwhere a Brazilian might lie hidden.\n\n\"Your indigestion does honor to my wife's dinner, Lisbeth,\" said he,\nscrutinizing her, for Lisbeth was perfectly well, trying to imitate the\nhiccough of spasmodic indigestion as she drank her tea.\n\n\"How lucky it is that dear Betty should be living under my roof!\" said\nMadame Marneffe. \"But for me, the poor thing would have died.\"\n\n\"You look as if you only half believed it,\" added Lisbeth, turning to\nthe Baron, \"and that would be a shame----\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked the Baron. \"Do you know the purpose of my visit?\"\n\nAnd he leered at the door of a dressing-closet from which the key had\nbeen withdrawn.\n\n\"Are you talking Greek?\" said Madame Marneffe, with an appealing look of\nmisprized tenderness and devotedness.\n\n\"But it is all through you, my dear cousin; yes, it is your doing that I\nam in such a state,\" said Lisbeth vehemently.\n\nThis speech diverted the Baron's attention; he looked at the old maid\nwith the greatest astonishment.\n\n\"You know that I am devoted to you,\" said Lisbeth. \"I am here, that says\neverything. I am wearing out the last shreds of my strength in watching\nover your interests, since they are one with our dear Valerie's. Her\nhouse costs one-tenth of what any other does that is kept on the same\nscale. But for me, Cousin, instead of two thousand francs a month, you\nwould be obliged to spend three or four thousand.\"\n\n\"I know all that,\" replied the Baron out of patience; \"you are our\nprotectress in many ways,\" he added, turning to Madame Marneffe and\nputting his arm round her neck.--\"Is not she, my pretty sweet?\"\n\n\"On my honor,\" exclaimed Valerie, \"I believe you are gone mad!\"\n\n\"Well, you cannot doubt my attachment,\" said Lisbeth. \"But I am also\nvery fond of my cousin Adeline, and I found her in tears. She has not\nseen you for a month. Now that is really too bad; you leave my poor\nAdeline without a sou. Your daughter Hortense almost died of it when\nshe was told that it is thanks to your brother that we had any dinner at\nall. There was not even bread in your house this day.\n\n\"Adeline is heroically resolved to keep her sufferings to herself. She\nsaid to me, 'I will do as you have done!' The speech went to my heart;\nand after dinner, as I thought of what my cousin had been in 1811,\nand of what she is in 1841--thirty years after--I had a violent\nindigestion.--I fancied I should get over it; but when I got home, I\nthought I was dying--\"\n\n\"You see, Valerie, to what my adoration of you has brought me! To\ncrime--domestic crime!\"\n\n\"Oh! I was wise never to marry!\" cried Lisbeth, with savage joy. \"You\nare a kind, good man; Adeline is a perfect angel;--and this is the\nreward of her blind devotion.\"\n\n\"An elderly angel!\" said Madame Marneffe softly, as she looked half\ntenderly, half mockingly, at her Hector, who was gazing at her as an\nexamining judge gazes at the accused.\n\n\"My poor wife!\" said Hulot. \"For more than nine months I have given her\nno money, though I find it for you, Valerie; but at what a cost! No\none else will ever love you so, and what torments you inflict on me in\nreturn!\"\n\n\"Torments?\" she echoed. \"Then what do you call happiness?\"\n\n\"I do not yet know on what terms you have been with this so-called\ncousin whom you never mentioned to me,\" said the Baron, paying no heed\nto Valerie's interjection. \"But when he came in I felt as if a penknife\nhad been stuck into my heart. Blinded I may be, but I am not blind. I\ncould read his eyes, and yours. In short, from under that ape's eyelids\nthere flashed sparks that he flung at you--and your eyes!--Oh! you have\nnever looked at me so, never! As to this mystery, Valerie, it shall all\nbe cleared up. You are the only woman who ever made me know the meaning\nof jealousy, so you need not be surprised by what I say.--But another\nmystery which has rent its cloud, and it seems to me infamous----\"\n\n\"Go on, go on,\" said Valerie.\n\n\"It is that Crevel, that square lump of flesh and stupidity, is in love\nwith you, and that you accept his attentions with so good a grace that\nthe idiot flaunts his passion before everybody.\"\n\n\"Only three! Can you discover no more?\" asked Madame Marneffe.\n\n\"There may be more!\" retorted the Baron.\n\n\"If Monsieur Crevel is in love with me, he is in his rights as a man\nafter all; if I favored his passion, that would indeed be the act of\na coquette, or of a woman who would leave much to be desired on your\npart.--Well, love me as you find me, or let me alone. If you restore\nme to freedom, neither you nor Monsieur Crevel will ever enter my doors\nagain. But I will take up with my cousin, just to keep my hand in, in\nthose charming habits you suppose me to indulge.--Good-bye, Monsieur le\nBaron Hulot.\"\n\nShe rose, but the Baron took her by the arm and made her sit down\nagain. The old man could not do without Valerie. She had become more\nimperatively indispensable to him than the necessaries of life; he\npreferred remaining in uncertainty to having any proof of Valerie's\ninfidelity.\n\n\"My dearest Valerie,\" said he, \"do you not see how miserable I am? I\nonly ask you to justify yourself. Give me sufficient reasons--\"\n\n\"Well, go downstairs and wait for me; for I suppose you do not wish to\nlook on at the various ceremonies required by your cousin's state.\"\n\nHulot slowly turned away.\n\n\"You old profligate,\" cried Lisbeth, \"you have not even asked me how\nyour children are? What are you going to do for Adeline? I, at any rate,\nwill take her my savings to-morrow.\"\n\n\"You owe your wife white bread to eat at least,\" said Madame Marneffe,\nsmiling.\n\nThe Baron, without taking offence at Lisbeth's tone, as despotic as\nJosepha's, got out of the room, only too glad to escape so importunate a\nquestion.\n\n\n\nThe door bolted once more, the Brazilian came out of the\ndressing-closet, where he had been waiting, and he appeared with his\neyes full of tears, in a really pitiable condition. Montes had heard\neverything.\n\n\"Henri, you must have ceased to love me, I know it!\" said Madame\nMarneffe, hiding her face in her handkerchief and bursting into tears.\n\nIt was the outcry of real affection. The cry of a woman's despair is\nso convincing that it wins the forgiveness that lurks at the bottom of\nevery lover's heart--when she is young and pretty, and wears a gown so\nlow that she could slip out at the top and stand in the garb of Eve.\n\n\"But why, if you love me, do you not leave everything for my sake?\"\nasked the Brazilian.\n\nThis South American born, being logical, as men are who have lived the\nlife of nature, at once resumed the conversation at the point where it\nhad been broken off, putting his arm round Valerie's waist.\n\n\"Why?\" she repeated, gazing up at Henri, whom she subjugated at once by\na look charged with passion, \"why, my dear boy, I am married; we are in\nParis, not in the savannah, the pampas, the backwoods of America.--My\ndear Henri, my first and only love, listen to me. That husband of mine,\na second clerk in the War Office, is bent on being a head-clerk and\nofficer of the Legion of Honor; can I help his being ambitious? Now for\nthe very reason that made him leave us our liberty--nearly four years\nago, do you remember, you bad boy?--he now abandons me to Monsieur\nHulot. I cannot get rid of that dreadful official, who snorts like a\ngrampus, who has fins in his nostrils, who is sixty-three years old, and\nwho had grown ten years older by dint of trying to be young; who is so\nodious to me that the very day when Marneffe is promoted, and gets his\nCross of the Legion of Honor----\"\n\n\"How much more will your husband get then?\"\n\n\"A thousand crowns.\"\n\n\"I will pay him as much in an annuity,\" said Baron Montes. \"We will\nleave Paris and go----\"\n\n\"Where?\" said Valerie, with one of the pretty sneers by which a woman\nmakes fun of a man she is sure of. \"Paris is the only place where we can\nlive happy. I care too much for your love to risk seeing it die out in\na _tete-a-tete_ in the wilderness. Listen, Henri, you are the only man\nI care for in the whole world. Write that down clearly in your tiger's\nbrain.\"\n\nFor women, when they have made a sheep of a man, always tell him that he\nis a lion with a will of iron.\n\n\"Now, attend to me. Monsieur Marneffe has not five years to live; he is\nrotten to the marrow of his bones. He spends seven months of the twelve\nin swallowing drugs and decoctions; he lives wrapped in flannel; in\nshort, as the doctor says, he lives under the scythe, and may be cut off\nat any moment. An illness that would not harm another man would be fatal\nto him; his blood is corrupt, his life undermined at the root. For five\nyears I have never allowed him to kiss me--he is poisonous! Some day,\nand the day is not far off, I shall be a widow. Well, then, I--who have\nalready had an offer from a man with sixty thousand francs a year, I who\nam as completely mistress of that man as I am of this lump of sugar--I\nswear to you that if you were as poor as Hulot and as foul as Marneffe,\nif you beat me even, still you are the only man I will have for a\nhusband, the only man I love, or whose name I will ever bear. And I am\nready to give any pledge of my love that you may require.\"\n\n\"Well, then, to-night----\"\n\n\"But you, son of the South, my splendid jaguar, come expressly for me\nfrom the virgin forest of Brazil,\" said she, taking his hand and kissing\nand fondling it, \"I have some consideration for the poor creature you\nmean to make your wife.--Shall I be your wife, Henri?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Brazilian, overpowered by this unbridled volubility of\npassion. And he knelt at her feet.\n\n\"Well, then, Henri,\" said Valerie, taking his two hands and looking\nstraight into his eyes, \"swear to me now, in the presence of Lisbeth, my\nbest and only friend, my sister--that you will make me your wife at the\nend of my year's widowhood.\"\n\n\"I swear it.\"\n\n\"That is not enough. Swear by your mother's ashes and eternal salvation,\nswear by the Virgin Mary and by all your hopes as a Catholic!\"\n\nValerie knew that the Brazilian would keep that oath even if she should\nhave fallen into the foulest social slough.\n\nThe Baron solemnly swore it, his nose almost touching Valerie's white\nbosom, and his eyes spellbound. He was drunk, drunk as a man is when he\nsees the woman he loves once more, after a sea voyage of a hundred and\ntwenty days.\n\n\"Good. Now be quite easy. And in Madame Marneffe respect the future\nBaroness de Montejanos. You are not to spend a sou upon me; I forbid\nit.--Stay here in the outer room; sleep on the sofa. I myself will come\nand tell you when you may move.--We will breakfast to-morrow morning,\nand you can be leaving at about one o'clock as if you had come to call\nat noon. There is nothing to fear; the gate-keepers love me as much as\nif they were my father and mother.--Now I must go down and make tea.\"\n\nShe beckoned to Lisbeth, who followed her out on to the landing. There\nValerie whispered in the old maid's ear:\n\n\"My darkie has come back too soon. I shall die if I cannot avenge you on\nHortense!\"\n\n\"Make your mind easy, my pretty little devil!\" said Lisbeth, kissing her\nforehead. \"Love and Revenge on the same track will never lose the game.\nHortense expects me to-morrow; she is in beggary. For a thousand francs\nyou may have a thousand kisses from Wenceslas.\"\n\nOn leaving Valerie, Hulot had gone down to the porter's lodge and made a\nsudden invasion there.\n\n\"Madame Olivier?\"\n\nOn hearing the imperious tone of this address, and seeing the action\nby which the Baron emphasized it, Madame Olivier came out into the\ncourtyard as far as the Baron led her.\n\n\"You know that if any one can help your son to a connection by and by,\nit is I; it is owing to me that he is already third clerk in a notary's\noffice, and is finishing his studies.\"\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur le Baron; and indeed, sir, you may depend on our\ngratitude. Not a day passes that I do not pray to God for Monsieur le\nBaron's happiness.\"\n\n\"Not so many words, my good woman,\" said Hulot, \"but deeds----\"\n\n\"What can I do, sir?\" asked Madame Olivier.\n\n\"A man came here to-night in a carriage. Do you know him?\"\n\nMadame Olivier had recognized Montes well enough. How could she have\nforgotten him? In the Rue du Doyenne the Brazilian had always slipped a\nfive-franc piece into her hand as he went out in the morning, rather too\nearly. If the Baron had applied to Monsieur Olivier, he would perhaps\nhave learned all he wanted to know. But Olivier was in bed. In the\nlower orders the woman is not merely the superior of the man--she almost\nalways has the upper hand. Madame Olivier had long since made up her\nmind as to which side to take in case of a collision between her two\nbenefactors; she regarded Madame Marneffe as the stronger power.\n\n\"Do I know him?\" she repeated. \"No, indeed, no. I never saw him before!\"\n\n\"What! Did Madame Marneffe's cousin never go to see her when she was\nliving in the Rue du Doyenne?\"\n\n\"Oh! Was it her cousin?\" cried Madame Olivier. \"I dare say he did come,\nbut I did not know him again. Next time, sir, I will look at him----\"\n\n\"He will be coming out,\" said Hulot, hastily interrupting Madame\nOlivier.\n\n\"He has left,\" said Madame Olivier, understanding the situation. \"The\ncarriage is gone.\"\n\n\"Did you see him go?\"\n\n\"As plainly as I see you. He told his servant to drive to the Embassy.\"\n\nThis audacious statement wrung a sigh of relief from the Baron; he took\nMadame Olivier's hand and squeezed it.\n\n\"Thank you, my good Madame Olivier. But that is not all.--Monsieur\nCrevel?\"\n\n\"Monsieur Crevel? What can you mean, sir? I do not understand,\" said\nMadame Olivier.\n\n\"Listen to me. He is Madame Marneffe's lover----\"\n\n\"Impossible, Monsieur le Baron; impossible,\" said she, clasping her\nhands.\n\n\"He is Madame Marneffe's lover,\" the Baron repeated very positively.\n\"How do they manage it? I don't know; but I mean to know, and you are to\nfind out. If you can put me on the tracks of this intrigue, your son is\na notary.\"\n\n\"Don't you fret yourself so, Monsieur le Baron,\" said Madame Olivier.\n\"Madame cares for you, and for no one but you; her maid knows that for\ntrue, and we say, between her and me, that you are the luckiest man in\nthis world--for you know what madame is.--Just perfection!\n\n\"She gets up at ten every morning; then she breakfasts. Well and good.\nAfter that she takes an hour or so to dress; that carries her on till\ntwo; then she goes for a walk in the Tuileries in the sight of all\nmen, and she is always in by four to be ready for you. She lives like\nclockwork. She keeps no secrets from her maid, and Reine keeps nothing\nfrom me, you may be sure. Reine can't if she would--along of my son, for\nshe is very sweet upon him. So, you see, if madame had any intimacy with\nMonsieur Crevel, we should be bound to know it.\"\n\nThe Baron went upstairs again with a beaming countenance, convinced that\nhe was the only man in the world to that shameless slut, as treacherous,\nbut as lovely and as engaging as a siren.\n\nCrevel and Marneffe had begun a second rubber at piquet. Crevel was\nlosing, as a man must who is not giving his thoughts to his game.\nMarneffe, who knew the cause of the Mayor's absence of mind, took\nunscrupulous advantage of it; he looked at the cards in reverse, and\ndiscarded accordingly; thus, knowing his adversary's hand, he played\nto beat him. The stake being a franc a point, he had already robbed the\nMayor of thirty francs when Hulot came in.\n\n\"Hey day!\" said he, amazed to find no company. \"Are you alone? Where is\neverybody gone?\"\n\n\"Your pleasant temper put them all to flight,\" said Crevel.\n\n\"No, it was my wife's cousin,\" replied Marneffe. \"The ladies and\ngentlemen supposed that Valerie and Henri might have something to say\nto each other after three years' separation, and they very discreetly\nretired.--If I had been in the room, I would have kept them; but then,\nas it happens, it would have been a mistake, for Lisbeth, who always\ncomes down to make tea at half-past ten, was taken ill, and that upset\neverything--\"\n\n\"Then is Lisbeth really unwell?\" asked Crevel in a fury.\n\n\"So I was told,\" replied Marneffe, with the heartless indifference of a\nman to whom women have ceased to exist.\n\nThe Mayor looked at the clock; and, calculating the time, the Baron\nseemed to have spent forty minutes in Lisbeth's rooms. Hector's jubilant\nexpression seriously incriminated Valerie, Lisbeth, and himself.\n\n\"I have just seen her; she is in great pain, poor soul!\" said the Baron.\n\n\"Then the sufferings of others must afford you much joy, my friend,\"\nretorted Crevel with acrimony, \"for you have come down with a face that\nis positively beaming. Is Lisbeth likely to die? For your daughter, they\nsay, is her heiress. You are not like the same man. You left this room\nlooking like the Moor of Venice, and you come back with the air\nof Saint-Preux!--I wish I could see Madame Marneffe's face at this\nminute----\"\n\n\"And pray, what do you mean by that?\" said Marneffe to Crevel, packing\nhis cards and laying them down in front of him.\n\nA light kindled in the eyes of this man, decrepit at the age of\nforty-seven; a faint color flushed his flaccid cold cheeks, his\nill-furnished mouth was half open, and on his blackened lips a sort\nof foam gathered, thick, and as white as chalk. This fury in such a\nhelpless wretch, whose life hung on a thread, and who in a duel would\nrisk nothing while Crevel had everything to lose, frightened the Mayor.\n\n\"I said,\" repeated Crevel, \"that I should like to see Madame Marneffe's\nface. And with all the more reason since yours, at this moment, is most\nunpleasant. On my honor, you are horribly ugly, my dear Marneffe----\"\n\n\"Do you know that you are very uncivil?\"\n\n\"A man who has won thirty francs of me in forty-five minutes cannot look\nhandsome in my eyes.\"\n\n\"Ah, if you had but seen me seventeen years ago!\" replied the clerk.\n\n\"You were so good-looking?\" asked Crevel.\n\n\"That was my ruin; now, if I had been like you--I might be a mayor and a\npeer.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Crevel, with a smile, \"you have been too much in the wars;\nand of the two forms of metal that may be earned by worshiping the\ngod of trade, you have taken the worse--the dross!\" [This dialogue\nis garnished with puns for which it is difficult to find any English\nequivalent.] And Crevel roared with laughter. Though Marneffe could\ntake offence if his honor were in peril, he always took these rough\npleasantries in good part; they were the small coin of conversation\nbetween him and Crevel.\n\n\"The daughters of Eve cost me dear, no doubt; but, by the powers! 'Short\nand sweet' is my motto.\"\n\n\"'Long and happy' is more to my mind,\" returned Crevel.\n\nMadame Marneffe now came in; she saw that her husband was at cards with\nCrevel, and only the Baron in the room besides; a mere glance at the\nmunicipal dignitary showed her the frame of mind he was in, and her line\nof conduct was at once decided on.\n\n\"Marneffe, my dear boy,\" said she, leaning on her husband's shoulder,\nand passing her pretty fingers through his dingy gray hair, but without\nsucceeding in covering his bald head with it, \"it is very late for you;\nyou ought to be in bed. To-morrow, you know, you must dose yourself by\nthe doctor's orders. Reine will give you your herb tea at seven. If you\nwish to live, give up your game.\"\n\n\"We will pay it out up to five points,\" said Marneffe to Crevel.\n\n\"Very good--I have scored two,\" replied the Mayor.\n\n\"How long will it take you?\"\n\n\"Ten minutes,\" said Marneffe.\n\n\"It is eleven o'clock,\" replied Valerie. \"Really, Monsieur Crevel, one\nmight fancy you meant to kill my husband. Make haste, at any rate.\"\n\nThis double-barreled speech made Crevel and Hulot smile, and even\nMarneffe himself. Valerie sat down to talk to Hector.\n\n\"You must leave, my dearest,\" said she in Hulot's ear. \"Walk up and down\nthe Rue Vanneau, and come in again when you see Crevel go out.\"\n\n\"I would rather leave this room and go into your room through the\ndressing-room door. You could tell Reine to let me in.\"\n\n\"Reine is upstairs attending to Lisbeth.\"\n\n\"Well, suppose then I go up to Lisbeth's rooms?\"\n\nDanger hemmed in Valerie on every side; she foresaw a discussion with\nCrevel, and could not allow Hulot to be in her room, where he could hear\nall that went on.--And the Brazilian was upstairs with Lisbeth.\n\n\"Really, you men, when you have a notion in your head, you would burn\na house down to get into it!\" exclaimed she. \"Lisbeth is not in a fit\nstate to admit you.--Are you afraid of catching cold in the street? Be\noff there--or good-night.\"\n\n\"Good evening, gentlemen,\" said the Baron to the other two.\n\nHulot, when piqued in his old man's vanity, was bent on proving that he\ncould play the young man by waiting for the happy hour in the open air,\nand he went away.\n\nMarneffe bid his wife good-night, taking her hands with a semblance of\ndevotion. Valerie pressed her husband's hand with a significant glance,\nconveying:\n\n\"Get rid of Crevel.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Crevel,\" said Marneffe. \"I hope you will not stay long with\nValerie. Yes! I am jealous--a little late in the day, but it has me hard\nand fast. I shall come back to see if you are gone.\"\n\n\"We have a little business to discuss, but I shall not stay long,\" said\nCrevel.\n\n\"Speak low.--What is it?\" said Valerie, raising her voice, and looking\nat him with a mingled expression of haughtiness and scorn.\n\nCrevel, as he met this arrogant stare, though he was doing Valerie\nimportant services, and had hoped to plume himself on the fact, was at\nonce reduced to submission.\n\n\"That Brazilian----\" he began, but, overpowered by Valerie's fixed look\nof contempt, he broke off.\n\n\"What of him?\" said she.\n\n\"That cousin--\"\n\n\"Is no cousin of mine,\" said she. \"He is my cousin to the world and to\nMonsieur Marneffe. And if he were my lover, it would be no concern of\nyours. A tradesman who pays a woman to be revenged on another man, is,\nin my opinion, beneath the man who pays her for love of her. You did not\ncare for me; all you saw in me was Monsieur Hulot's mistress. You bought\nme as a man buys a pistol to kill his adversary. I wanted bread--I\naccepted the bargain.\"\n\n\"But you have not carried it out,\" said Crevel, the tradesman once more.\n\n\"You want Baron Hulot to be told that you have robbed him of his\nmistress, to pay him out for having robbed you of Josepha? Nothing can\nmore clearly prove your baseness. You say you love a woman, you treat\nher like a duchess, and then you want to degrade her? Well, my good\nfellow, and you are right. This woman is no match for Josepha. That\nyoung person has the courage of her disgrace, while I--I am a hypocrite,\nand deserve to be publicly whipped.--Alas! Josepha is protected by\nher cleverness and her wealth. I have nothing to shelter me but my\nreputation; I am still the worthy and blameless wife of a plain citizen;\nif you create a scandal, what is to become of me? If I were rich, then\nindeed; but my income is fifteen thousand francs a year at most, I\nsuppose.\"\n\n\"Much more than that,\" said Crevel. \"I have doubled your savings in\nthese last two months by investing in _Orleans_.\"\n\n\"Well, a position in Paris begins with fifty thousand. And you certainly\nwill not make up to me for the position I should surrender.--What was\nmy aim? I want to see Marneffe a first-class clerk; he will then draw\na salary of six thousand francs. He has been twenty-seven years in his\noffice; within three years I shall have a right to a pension of fifteen\nhundred francs when he dies. You, to whom I have been entirely kind, to\nwhom I have given your fill of happiness--you cannot wait!--And that is\nwhat men call love!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Though I began with an ulterior purpose,\" said Crevel, \"I have become\nyour poodle. You trample on my heart, you crush me, you stultify me, and\nI love you as I have never loved in my life. Valerie, I love you as much\nas I love my Celestine. I am capable of anything for your sake.--Listen,\ninstead of coming twice a week to the Rue du Dauphin, come three times.\"\n\n\"Is that all! You are quite young again, my dear boy!\"\n\n\"Only let me pack off Hulot, humiliate him, rid you of him,\" said\nCrevel, not heeding her impertinence! \"Have nothing to say to the\nBrazilian, be mine alone; you shall not repent of it. To begin with, I\nwill give you eight thousand francs a year, secured by bond, but only as\nan annuity; I will not give you the capital till the end of five years'\nconstancy--\"\n\n\"Always a bargain! A tradesman can never learn to give. You want to stop\nfor refreshments on the road of love--in the form of Government bonds!\nBah! Shopman, pomatum seller! you put a price on everything!--Hector\ntold me that the Duc d'Herouville gave Josepha a bond for thirty\nthousand francs a year in a packet of sugar almonds! And I am worth six\nof Josepha.\n\n\"Oh! to be loved!\" she went on, twisting her ringlets round her fingers,\nand looking at herself in the glass. \"Henri loves me. He would smash\nyou like a fly if I winked at him! Hulot loves me; he leaves his wife in\nbeggary! As for you, go my good man, be the worthy father of a family.\nYou have three hundred thousand francs over and above your fortune,\nonly to amuse yourself, a hoard, in fact, and you think of nothing but\nincreasing it--\"\n\n\"For you, Valerie, since I offer you half,\" said he, falling on his\nknees.\n\n\"What, still here!\" cried Marneffe, hideous in his dressing-gown. \"What\nare you about?\"\n\n\"He is begging my pardon, my dear, for an insulting proposal he has\ndared to make me. Unable to obtain my consent, my gentleman proposed to\npay me----\"\n\nCrevel only longed to vanish into the cellar, through a trap, as is done\non the stage.\n\n\"Get up, Crevel,\" said Marneffe, laughing, \"you are ridiculous. I can\nsee by Valerie's manner that my honor is in no danger.\"\n\n\"Go to bed and sleep in peace,\" said Madame Marneffe.\n\n\"Isn't she clever?\" thought Crevel. \"She has saved me. She is adorable!\"\n\nAs Marneffe disappeared, the Mayor took Valerie's hands and kissed them,\nleaving on them the traces of tears.\n\n\"It shall all stand in your name,\" he said.\n\n\"That is true love,\" she whispered in his ear. \"Well, love for love.\nHulot is below, in the street. The poor old thing is waiting to return\nwhen I place a candle in one of the windows of my bedroom. I give you\nleave to tell him that you are the man I love; he will refuse to believe\nyou; take him to the Rue du Dauphin, give him every proof, crush him; I\nallow it--I order it! I am tired of that old seal; he bores me to death.\nKeep your man all night in the Rue du Dauphin, grill him over a slow\nfire, be revenged for the loss of Josepha. Hulot may die of it perhaps,\nbut we shall save his wife and children from utter ruin. Madame Hulot is\nworking for her bread--\"\n\n\"Oh! poor woman! On my word, it is quite shocking!\" exclaimed Crevel,\nhis natural feeling coming to the top.\n\n\"If you love me, Celestin,\" said she in Crevel's ear, which she\ntouched with her lips, \"keep him there, or I am done for. Marneffe is\nsuspicious. Hector has a key of the outer gate, and will certainly come\nback.\"\n\nCrevel clasped Madame Marneffe to his heart, and went away in the\nseventh heaven of delight. Valerie fondly escorted him to the landing,\nand then followed him, like a woman magnetized, down the stairs to the\nvery bottom.\n\n\"My Valerie, go back, do not compromise yourself before the porters.--Go\nback; my life, my treasure, all is yours.--Go in, my duchess!\"\n\n\"Madame Olivier,\" Valerie called gently when the gate was closed.\n\n\"Why, madame! You here?\" said the woman in bewilderment.\n\n\"Bolt the gates at top and bottom, and let no one in.\"\n\n\"Very good, madame.\"\n\nHaving barred the gate, Madame Olivier told of the bribe that the War\nOffice chief had tried to offer her.\n\n\"You behaved like an angel, my dear Olivier; we shall talk of that\nto-morrow.\"\n\nValerie flew like an arrow to the third floor, tapped three times\nat Lisbeth's door, and then went down to her room, where she gave\ninstructions to Mademoiselle Reine, for a woman must make the most of\nthe opportunity when a Montes arrives from Brazil.\n\n\n\n\"By Heaven! only a woman of the world is capable of such love,\" said\nCrevel to himself. \"How she came down those stairs, lighting them\nup with her eyes, following me! Never did Josepha--Josepha! she is\ncag-mag!\" cried the ex-bagman. \"What have I said? _Cag-mag_--why, I\nmight have let the word slip out at the Tuileries! I can never do\nany good unless Valerie educates me--and I was so bent on being a\ngentleman.--What a woman she is! She upsets me like a fit of the colic\nwhen she looks at me coldly. What grace! What wit! Never did Josepha\nmove me so. And what perfection when you come to know her!--Ha, there is\nmy man!\"\n\nHe perceived in the gloom of the Rue de Babylone the tall, somewhat\nstooping figure of Hulot, stealing along close to a boarding, and he\nwent straight up to him.\n\n\"Good-morning, Baron, for it is past midnight, my dear fellow. What\nthe devil are your doing here? You are airing yourself under a pleasant\ndrizzle. That is not wholesome at our time of life. Will you let me give\nyou a little piece of advice? Let each of us go home; for, between you\nand me, you will not see the candle in the window.\"\n\nThe last words made the Baron suddenly aware that he was sixty-three,\nand that his cloak was wet.\n\n\"Who on earth told you--?\" he began.\n\n\"Valerie, of course, _our_ Valerie, who means henceforth to be _my_\nValerie. We are even now, Baron; we will play off the tie when you\nplease. You have nothing to complain of; you know, I always stipulated\nfor the right of taking my revenge; it took you three months to rob me\nof Josepha; I took Valerie from you in--We will say no more about that.\nNow I mean to have her all to myself. But we can be very good friends,\nall the same.\"\n\n\"Crevel, no jesting,\" said Hulot, in a voice choked by rage. \"It is a\nmatter of life and death.\"\n\n\"Bless me, is that how you take it!--Baron, do you not remember what you\nsaid to me the day of Hortense's marriage: 'Can two old gaffers like us\nquarrel over a petticoat? It is too low, too common. We are _Regence_,\nwe agreed, Pompadour, eighteenth century, quite the Marechal Richelieu,\nLouis XV., nay, and I may say, _Liaisons dangereuses_!\"\n\nCrevel might have gone on with his string of literary allusions; the\nBaron heard him as a deaf man listens when he is but half deaf. But,\nseeing in the gaslight the ghastly pallor of his face, the triumphant\nMayor stopped short. This was, indeed, a thunderbolt after Madame\nOlivier's asservations and Valerie's parting glance.\n\n\"Good God! And there are so many other women in Paris!\" he said at last.\n\n\"That is what I said to you when you took Josepha,\" said Crevel.\n\n\"Look here, Crevel, it is impossible. Give me some proof.--Have you a\nkey, as I have, to let yourself in?\"\n\nAnd having reached the house, the Baron put the key into the lock; but\nthe gate was immovable; he tried in vain to open it.\n\n\"Do not make a noise in the streets at night,\" said Crevel coolly. \"I\ntell you, Baron, I have far better proof than you can show.\"\n\n\"Proofs! give me proof!\" cried the Baron, almost crazy with\nexasperation.\n\n\"Come, and you shall have them,\" said Crevel.\n\nAnd in obedience to Valerie's instructions, he led the Baron away\ntowards the quay, down the Rue Hillerin-Bertin. The unhappy Baron walked\non, as a merchant walks on the day before he stops payment; he was lost\nin conjectures as to the reasons of the depravity buried in the depths\nof Valerie's heart, and still believed himself the victim of some\npractical joke. As they crossed the Pont Royal, life seemed to him\nso blank, so utterly a void, and so out of joint from his financial\ndifficulties, that he was within an ace of yielding to the evil\nprompting that bid him fling Crevel into the river and throw himself in\nafter.\n\nOn reaching the Rue du Dauphin, which had not yet been widened, Crevel\nstopped before a door in a wall. It opened into a long corridor paved\nwith black-and-white marble, and serving as an entrance-hall, at the end\nof which there was a flight of stairs and a doorkeeper's lodge, lighted\nfrom an inner courtyard, as is often the case in Paris. This courtyard,\nwhich was shared with another house, was oddly divided into two unequal\nportions. Crevel's little house, for he owned it, had additional\nrooms with a glass skylight, built out on to the adjoining plot, under\nconditions that it should have no story added above the ground floor, so\nthat the structure was entirely hidden by the lodge and the projecting\nmass of the staircase.\n\nThis back building had long served as a store-room, backshop, and\nkitchen to one of the shops facing the street. Crevel had cut off\nthese three rooms from the rest of the ground floor, and Grindot had\ntransformed them into an inexpensive private residence. There were two\nways in--from the front, through the shop of a furniture-dealer, to whom\nCrevel let it at a low price, and only from month to month, so as to be\nable to get rid of him in case of his telling tales, and also through a\ndoor in the wall of the passage, so ingeniously hidden as to be almost\ninvisible. The little apartment, comprising a dining-room, drawing-room,\nand bedroom, all lighted from above, and standing partly on Crevel's\nground and partly on his neighbor's, was very difficult to find. With\nthe exception of the second-hand furniture-dealer, the tenants knew\nnothing of the existence of this little paradise.\n\nThe doorkeeper, paid to keep Crevel's secrets, was a capital cook. So\nMonsieur le Maire could go in and out of his inexpensive retreat at any\nhour of the night without any fear of being spied upon. By day, a lady,\ndressed as Paris women dress to go shopping, and having a key, ran\nno risk in coming to Crevel's lodgings; she would stop to look at the\ncheapened goods, ask the price, go into the shop, and come out again,\nwithout exciting the smallest suspicion if any one should happen to meet\nher.\n\nAs soon as Crevel had lighted the candles in the sitting-room, the Baron\nwas surprised at the elegance and refinement it displayed. The perfumer\nhad given the architect a free hand, and Grindot had done himself\ncredit by fittings in the Pompadour style, which had in fact cost sixty\nthousand francs.\n\n\"What I want,\" said Crevel to Grindot, \"is that a duchess, if I brought\none there, should be surprised at it.\"\n\nHe wanted to have a perfect Parisian Eden for his Eve, his \"real lady,\"\nhis Valerie, his duchess.\n\n\"There are two beds,\" said Crevel to Hulot, showing him a sofa that\ncould be made wide enough by pulling out a drawer. \"This is one, the\nother is in the bedroom. We can both spend the night here.\"\n\n\"Proof!\" was all the Baron could say.\n\nCrevel took a flat candlestick and led Hulot into the adjoining room,\nwhere he saw, on a sofa, a superb dressing-gown belonging to Valerie,\nwhich he had seen her wear in the Rue Vanneau, to display it before\nwearing it in Crevel's little apartment. The Mayor pressed the spring of\na little writing-table of inlaid work, known as a _bonheur-du-jour_, and\ntook out of it a letter that he handed to the Baron.\n\n\"Read that,\" said he.\n\nThe Councillor read these words written in pencil:\n\n  \"I have waited in vain, you old wretch! A woman of my quality does\n  not expect to be kept waiting by a retired perfumer. There was no\n  dinner ordered--no cigarettes. I will make you pay for this!\"\n\n\"Well, is that her writing?\"\n\n\"Good God!\" gasped Hulot, sitting down in dismay. \"I see all the things\nshe uses--her caps, her slippers. Why, how long since--?\"\n\nCrevel nodded that he understood, and took a packet of bills out of the\nlittle inlaid cabinet.\n\n\"You can see, old man. I paid the decorators in December, 1838. In\nOctober, two months before, this charming little place was first used.\"\n\nHulot bent his head.\n\n\"How the devil do you manage it? I know how she spends every hour of her\nday.\"\n\n\"How about her walk in the Tuileries?\" said Crevel, rubbing his hands in\ntriumph.\n\n\"What then?\" said Hulot, mystified.\n\n\"Your lady love comes to the Tuileries, she is supposed to be airing\nherself from one till four. But, hop, skip, and jump, and she is here.\nYou know your Moliere? Well, Baron, there is nothing imaginary in your\ntitle.\"\n\nHulot, left without a shred of doubt, sat sunk in ominous silence.\nCatastrophes lead intelligent and strong-minded men to be philosophical.\nThe Baron, morally, was at this moment like a man trying to find his\nway by night through a forest. This gloomy taciturnity and the change in\nthat dejected countenance made Crevel very uneasy, for he did not wish\nthe death of his colleague.\n\n\"As I said, old fellow, we are now even; let us play for the odd. Will\nyou play off the tie by hook and by crook? Come!\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Hulot, talking to himself--\"why is it that out of ten pretty\nwomen at least seven are false?\"\n\nBut the Baron was too much upset to answer his own question. Beauty\nis the greatest of human gifts for power. Every power that has no\ncounterpoise, no autocratic control, leads to abuses and folly.\nDespotism is the madness of power; in women the despot is caprice.\n\n\"You have nothing to complain of, my good friend; you have a beautiful\nwife, and she is virtuous.\"\n\n\"I deserve my fate,\" said Hulot. \"I have undervalued my wife and\nmade her miserable, and she is an angel! Oh, my poor Adeline! you are\navenged! She suffers in solitude and silence, and she is worthy of my\nlove; I ought--for she is still charming, fair and girlish even--But was\nthere ever a woman known more base, more ignoble, more villainous than\nthis Valerie?\"\n\n\"She is a good-for-nothing slut,\" said Crevel, \"a hussy that deserves\nwhipping on the Place du Chatelet. But, my dear Canillac, though we are\nsuch blades, so Marechal de Richelieu, Louis XV., Pompadour, Madame du\nBarry, gay dogs, and everything that is most eighteenth century, there\nis no longer a lieutenant of police.\"\n\n\"How can we make them love us?\" Hulot wondered to himself without\nheeding Crevel.\n\n\"It is sheer folly in us to expect to be loved, my dear fellow,\" said\nCrevel. \"We can only be endured; for Madame Marneffe is a hundred times\nmore profligate than Josepha.\"\n\n\"And avaricious! she costs me a hundred and ninety-two thousand francs a\nyear!\" cried Hulot.\n\n\"And how many centimes!\" sneered Crevel, with the insolence of a\nfinancier who scorns so small a sum.\n\n\"You do not love her, that is very evident,\" said the Baron dolefully.\n\n\"I have had enough of her,\" replied Crevel, \"for she has had more than\nthree hundred thousand francs of mine!\"\n\n\"Where is it? Where does it all go?\" said the Baron, clasping his head\nin his hands.\n\n\"If we had come to an agreement, like the simple young men who combine\nto maintain a twopenny baggage, she would have cost us less.\"\n\n\"That is an idea\"! replied the Baron. \"But she would still be cheating\nus; for, my burly friend, what do you say to this Brazilian?\"\n\n\"Ay, old sly fox, you are right, we are swindled like--like\nshareholders!\" said Crevel. \"All such women are an unlimited liability,\nand we the sleeping partners.\"\n\n\"Then it was she who told you about the candle in the window?\"\n\n\"My good man,\" replied Crevel, striking an attitude, \"she has fooled us\nboth. Valerie is a--She told me to keep you here.--Now I see it all. She\nhas got her Brazilian!--Oh, I have done with her, for if you hold her\nhands, she would find a way to cheat you with her feet! There! she is a\nminx, a jade!\"\n\n\"She is lower than a prostitute,\" said the Baron. \"Josepha and Jenny\nCadine were in their rights when they were false to us; they make a\ntrade of their charms.\"\n\n\"But she, who affects the saint--the prude!\" said Crevel. \"I tell you\nwhat, Hulot, do you go back to your wife; your money matters are not\nlooking well; I have heard talk of certain notes of hand given to a low\nusurer whose special line of business is lending to these sluts, a man\nnamed Vauvinet. For my part, I am cured of your 'real ladies.' And,\nafter all, at our time of life what do we want of these swindling\nhussies, who, to be honest, cannot help playing us false? You have white\nhair and false teeth; I am of the shape of Silenus. I shall go in for\nsaving. Money never deceives one. Though the Treasury is indeed open\nto all the world twice a year, it pays you interest, and this woman\nswallows it. With you, my worthy friend, as Gubetta, as my partner in\nthe concern, I might have resigned myself to a shady bargain--no, a\nphilosophical calm. But with a Brazilian who has possibly smuggled in\nsome doubtful colonial produce----\"\n\n\"Woman is an inexplicable creature!\" said Hulot.\n\n\"I can explain her,\" said Crevel. \"We are old; the Brazilian is young\nand handsome.\"\n\n\"Yes; that, I own, is true,\" said Hulot; \"we are older than we\nwere. But, my dear fellow, how is one to do without these pretty\ncreatures--seeing them undress, twist up their hair, smile cunningly\nthrough their fingers as they screw up their curl-papers, put on all\ntheir airs and graces, tell all their lies, declare that we don't love\nthem when we are worried with business; and they cheer us in spite of\neverything.\"\n\n\"Yes, by the Power! It is the only pleasure in life!\" cried Crevel.\n\"When a saucy little mug smiles at you and says, 'My old dear, you don't\nknow how nice you are! I am not like other women, I suppose, who go\ncrazy over mere boys with goats' beards, smelling of smoke, and as\ncoarse as serving-men! For in their youth they are so insolent!--They\ncome in and they bid you good-morning, and out they go.--I, whom you\nthink such a flirt, I prefer a man of fifty to these brats. A man who\nwill stick by me, who is devoted, who knows a woman is not to be picked\nup every day, and appreciates us.--That is what I love you for, you\nold monster!'--and they fill up these avowals with little pettings and\nprettinesses and--Faugh! they are as false as the bills on the Hotel de\nVille.\"\n\n\"A lie is sometimes better than the truth,\" said Hulot, remembering\nsundry bewitching scenes called up by Crevel, who mimicked Valerie.\n\"They are obliged to act upon their lies, to sew spangles on their stage\nfrocks--\"\n\n\"And they are ours, after all, the lying jades!\" said Crevel coarsely.\n\n\"Valerie is a witch,\" said the Baron. \"She can turn an old man into a\nyoung one.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" said Crevel, \"she is an eel that wriggles through your\nhands; but the prettiest eel, as white and sweet as sugar, as amusing as\nArnal--and ingenious!\"\n\n\"Yes, she is full of fun,\" said Hulot, who had now quite forgotten his\nwife.\n\nThe colleagues went to bed the best friends in the world, reminding each\nother of Valerie's perfections, the tones of her voice, her kittenish\nway, her movements, her fun, her sallies of wit, and of affections; for\nshe was an artist in love, and had charming impulses, as tenors may sing\na scena better one day than another. And they fell asleep, cradled in\ntempting and diabolical visions lighted by the fires of hell.\n\nAt nine o'clock next morning Hulot went off to the War Office, Crevel\nhad business out of town; they left the house together, and Crevel held\nout his hand to the Baron, saying:\n\n\"To show that there is no ill-feeling. For we, neither of us, will have\nanything more to say to Madame Marneffe?\"\n\n\"Oh, this is the end of everything,\" replied Hulot with a sort of\nhorror.\n\n\n\nBy half-past ten Crevel was mounting the stairs, four at a time, up to\nMadame Marneffe's apartment. He found the infamous wretch, the adorable\nenchantress, in the most becoming morning wrapper, enjoying an elegant\nlittle breakfast in the society of the Baron Montes de Montejanos and\nLisbeth. Though the sight of the Brazilian gave him a shock, Crevel\nbegged Madame Marneffe to grant him two minutes' speech with her.\nValerie led Crevel into the drawing-room.\n\n\"Valerie, my angel,\" said the amorous Mayor, \"Monsieur Marneffe cannot\nhave long to live. If you will be faithful to me, when he dies we will\nbe married. Think it over. I have rid you of Hulot.--So just consider\nwhether this Brazilian is to compare with a Mayor of Paris, a man who,\nfor your sake, will make his way to the highest dignities, and who can\nalready offer you eighty-odd thousand francs a year.\"\n\n\"I will think it over,\" said she. \"You will see me in the Rue du Dauphin\nat two o'clock, and we can discuss the matter. But be a good boy--and do\nnot forget the bond you promised to transfer to me.\"\n\nShe returned to the dining-room, followed by Crevel, who flattered\nhimself that he had hit on a plan for keeping Valerie to himself; but\nthere he found Baron Hulot, who, during this short colloquy, had also\narrived with the same end in view. He, like Crevel, begged for a brief\ninterview. Madame Marneffe again rose to go to the drawing-room, with a\nsmile at the Brazilian that seemed to say, \"What fools they are! Cannot\nthey see you?\"\n\n\"Valerie,\" said the official, \"my child, that cousin of yours is an\nAmerican cousin--\"\n\n\"Oh, that is enough!\" she cried, interrupting the Baron. \"Marneffe never\nhas been, and never will be, never can be my husband! The first, the\nonly man I ever loved, has come back quite unexpectedly. It is no fault\nof mine! But look at Henri and look at yourself. Then ask yourself\nwhether a woman, and a woman in love, can hesitate for a moment. My dear\nfellow, I am not a kept mistress. From this day forth I refuse to play\nthe part of Susannah between the two Elders. If you really care for me,\nyou and Crevel, you will be our friends; but all else is at an end, for\nI am six-and-twenty, and henceforth I mean to be a saint, an admirable\nand worthy wife--as yours is.\"\n\n\"Is that what you have to say?\" answered Hulot. \"Is this the way\nyou receive me when I come like a Pope with my hands full of\nIndulgences?--Well, your husband will never be a first-class clerk, nor\nbe promoted in the Legion of Honor.\"\n\n\"That remains to be seen,\" said Madame Marneffe, with a meaning look at\nHulot.\n\n\"Well, well, no temper,\" said Hulot in despair. \"I will call this\nevening, and we will come to an understanding.\"\n\n\"In Lisbeth's rooms then.\"\n\n\"Very good--at Lisbeth's,\" said the old dotard.\n\nHulot and Crevel went downstairs together without speaking a word till\nthey were in the street; but outside on the sidewalk they looked at each\nother with a dreary laugh.\n\n\"We are a couple of old fools,\" said Crevel.\n\n\"I have got rid of them,\" said Madame Marneffe to Lisbeth, as she sat\ndown once more. \"I never loved and I never shall love any man but my\nJaguar,\" she added, smiling at Henri Montes. \"Lisbeth, my dear, you\ndon't know. Henri has forgiven me the infamy to which I was reduced by\npoverty.\"\n\n\"It was my own fault,\" said the Brazilian. \"I ought to have sent you a\nhundred thousand francs.\"\n\n\"Poor boy!\" said Valerie; \"I might have worked for my living, but my\nfingers were not made for that--ask Lisbeth.\"\n\nThe Brazilian went away the happiest man in Paris.\n\nAt noon Valerie and Lisbeth were chatting in the splendid bedroom where\nthis dangerous woman was giving to her dress those finishing touches\nwhich a lady alone can give. The doors were bolted, the curtains drawn\nover them, and Valerie related in every detail all the events of the\nevening, the night, the morning.\n\n\"What do you think of it all, my darling?\" she said to Lisbeth in\nconclusion. \"Which shall I be when the time comes--Madame Crevel, or\nMadame Montes?\"\n\n\"Crevel will not last more than ten years, such a profligate as he is,\"\nreplied Lisbeth. \"Montes is young. Crevel will leave you about thirty\nthousand francs a year. Let Montes wait; he will be happy enough as\nBenjamin. And so, by the time you are three-and-thirty, if you take care\nof your looks, you may marry your Brazilian and make a fine show with\nsixty thousand francs a year of your own--especially under the wing of a\nMarechale.\"\n\n\"Yes, but Montes is a Brazilian; he will never make his mark,\" observed\nValerie.\n\n\"We live in the day of railways,\" said Lisbeth, \"when foreigners rise to\nhigh positions in France.\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" replied Valerie, \"when Marneffe is dead. He has not much\nlonger to suffer.\"\n\n\"These attacks that return so often are a sort of physical remorse,\"\nsaid Lisbeth. \"Well, I am off to see Hortense.\"\n\n\"Yes--go, my angel!\" replied Valerie. \"And bring me my artist.--Three\nyears, and I have not gained an inch of ground! It is a disgrace to both\nof us!--Wenceslas and Henri--these are my two passions--one for love,\nthe other for fancy.\"\n\n\"You are lovely this morning,\" said Lisbeth, putting her arm round\nValerie's waist and kissing her forehead. \"I enjoy all your pleasures,\nyour good fortune, your dresses--I never really lived till the day when\nwe became sisters.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment, my tiger-cat!\" cried Valerie, laughing; \"your shawl is\ncrooked. You cannot put a shawl on yet in spite of my lessons for three\nyears--and you want to be Madame la Marechale Hulot!\"\n\nShod in prunella boots, over gray silk stockings, in a gown of handsome\ncorded silk, her hair in smooth bands under a very pretty black velvet\nbonnet, lined with yellow satin, Lisbeth made her way to the Rue\nSaint-Dominique by the Boulevard des Invalides, wondering whether sheer\ndejection would at last break down Hortense's brave spirit, and whether\nSarmatian instability, taken at a moment when, with such a character,\neverything is possible, would be too much for Steinbock's constancy.\n\n\n\nHortense and Wenceslas had the ground floor of a house situated at the\ncorner of the Rue Saint-Dominique and the Esplanade des Invalides.\nThese rooms, once in harmony with the honeymoon, now had that half-new,\nhalf-faded look that may be called the autumnal aspect of furniture.\nNewly married folks are as lavish and wasteful, without knowing it or\nintending it, of everything about them as they are of their affection.\nThinking only of themselves, they reck little of the future, which, at a\nlater time, weighs on the mother of a family.\n\nLisbeth found Hortense just as she had finished dressing a baby\nWenceslas, who had been carried into the garden.\n\n\"Good-morning, Betty,\" said Hortense, opening the door herself to her\ncousin. The cook was gone out, and the house-servant, who was also the\nnurse, was doing some washing.\n\n\"Good-morning, dear child,\" replied Lisbeth, kissing her. \"Is Wenceslas\nin the studio?\" she added in a whisper.\n\n\"No; he is in the drawing-room talking to Stidmann and Chanor.\"\n\n\"Can we be alone?\" asked Lisbeth.\n\n\"Come into my room.\"\n\nIn this room, the hangings of pink-flowered chintz with green leaves on\na white ground, constantly exposed to the sun, were much faded, as was\nthe carpet. The muslin curtains had not been washed for many a day. The\nsmell of tobacco hung about the room; for Wenceslas, now an artist of\nrepute, and born a fine gentleman, left his cigar-ash on the arms of the\nchairs and the prettiest pieces of furniture, as a man does to whom love\nallows everything--a man rich enough to scorn vulgar carefulness.\n\n\"Now, then, let us talk over your affairs,\" said Lisbeth, seeing her\npretty cousin silent in the armchair into which she had dropped. \"But\nwhat ails you? You look rather pale, my dear.\"\n\n\"Two articles have just come out in which my poor Wenceslas is pulled\nto pieces; I have read them, but I have hidden them from him, for they\nwould completely depress him. The marble statue of Marshal Montcornet\nis pronounced utterly bad. The bas-reliefs are allowed to pass muster,\nsimply to allow of the most perfidious praise of his talent as a\ndecorative artist, and to give the greater emphasis to the statement\nthat serious art is quite out of his reach! Stidmann, whom I besought\nto tell me the truth, broke my heart by confessing that his own opinion\nagreed with that of every other artist, of the critics, and the public.\nHe said to me in the garden before breakfast, 'If Wenceslas cannot\nexhibit a masterpiece next season, he must give up heroic sculpture\nand be content to execute idyllic subjects, small figures, pieces of\njewelry, and high-class goldsmiths' work!' This verdict is dreadful to\nme, for Wenceslas, I know, will never accept it; he feels he has so many\nfine ideas.\"\n\n\"Ideas will not pay the tradesman's bills,\" remarked Lisbeth. \"I was\nalways telling him so--nothing but money. Money is only to be had for\nwork done--things that ordinary folks like well enough to buy them. When\nan artist has to live and keep a family, he had far better have a design\nfor a candlestick on his counter, or for a fender or a table, than for\ngroups or statues. Everybody must have such things, while he may wait\nmonths for the admirer of the group--and for his money---\"\n\n\"You are right, my good Lisbeth. Tell him all that; I have not the\ncourage.--Besides, as he was saying to Stidmann, if he goes back to\nornamental work and small sculpture, he must give up all hope of the\nInstitute and grand works of art, and we should not get the three\nhundred thousand francs' worth of work promised at Versailles and by the\nCity of Paris and the Ministers. That is what we are robbed of by those\ndreadful articles, written by rivals who want to step into our shoes.\"\n\n\"And that is not what you dreamed of, poor little puss!\" said Lisbeth,\nkissing Hortense on the brow. \"You expected to find a gentleman, a\nleader of Art, the chief of all living sculptors.--But that is poetry,\nyou see, a dream requiring fifty thousand francs a year, and you have\nonly two thousand four hundred--so long as I live. After my death three\nthousand.\"\n\nA few tears rose to Hortense's eyes, and Lisbeth drank them with her\neyes as a cat laps milk.\n\nThis is the story of their honeymoon--the tale will perhaps not be lost\non some artists.\n\nIntellectual work, labor in the upper regions of mental effort, is one\nof the grandest achievements of man. That which deserves real glory\nin Art--for by Art we must understand every creation of the mind--is\ncourage above all things--a sort of courage of which the vulgar have no\nconception, and which has never perhaps been described till now.\n\nDriven by the dreadful stress of poverty, goaded by Lisbeth, and kept\nby her in blinders, as a horse is, to hinder it from seeing to the right\nand left of its road, lashed on by that hard woman, the personification\nof Necessity, a sort of deputy Fate, Wenceslas, a born poet and dreamer,\nhad gone on from conception to execution, and overleaped, without\nsounding it, the gulf that divides these two hemispheres of Art. To\nmuse, to dream, to conceive of fine works, is a delightful occupation.\nIt is like smoking a magic cigar or leading the life of a courtesan who\nfollows her own fancy. The work then floats in all the grace of infancy,\nin the mad joy of conception, with the fragrant beauty of a flower, and\nthe aromatic juices of a fruit enjoyed in anticipation.\n\nThe man who can sketch his purpose beforehand in words is regarded as\na wonder, and every artist and writer possesses that faculty. But\ngestation, fruition, the laborious rearing of the offspring, putting it\nto bed every night full fed with milk, embracing it anew every morning\nwith the inexhaustible affection of a mother's heart, licking it clean,\ndressing it a hundred times in the richest garb only to be instantly\ndestroyed; then never to be cast down at the convulsions of this\nheadlong life till the living masterpiece is perfected which in\nsculpture speaks to every eye, in literature to every intellect, in\npainting to every memory, in music to every heart!--This is the task of\nexecution. The hand must be ready at every instant to come forward and\nobey the brain. But the brain has no more a creative power at command\nthan love has a perennial spring.\n\nThe habit of creativeness, the indefatigable love of motherhood which\nmakes a mother--that miracle of nature which Raphael so perfectly\nunderstood--the maternity of the brain, in short, which is so difficult\nto develop, is lost with prodigious ease. Inspiration is the opportunity\nof genius. She does not indeed dance on the razor's edge, she is in the\nair and flies away with the suspicious swiftness of a crow; she wears\nno scarf by which the poet can clutch her; her hair is a flame; she\nvanishes like the lovely rose and white flamingo, the sportsman's\ndespair. And work, again, is a weariful struggle, alike dreaded and\ndelighted in by these lofty and powerful natures who are often broken\nby it. A great poet of our day has said in speaking of this overwhelming\nlabor, \"I sit down to it in despair, but I leave it with regret.\" Be it\nknown to all who are ignorant! If the artist does not throw himself into\nhis work as Curtius sprang into the gulf, as a soldier leads a forlorn\nhope without a moment's thought, and if when he is in the crater he does\nnot dig on as a miner does when the earth has fallen in on him; if he\ncontemplates the difficulties before him instead of conquering them\none by one, like the lovers in fairy tales, who to win their princesses\novercome ever new enchantments, the work remains incomplete; it perishes\nin the studio where creativeness becomes impossible, and the artist\nlooks on at the suicide of his own talent.\n\nRossini, a brother genius to Raphael, is a striking instance in his\npoverty-stricken youth, compared with his latter years of opulence. This\nis the reason why the same prize, the same triumph, the same bays are\nawarded to great poets and to great generals.\n\nWenceslas, by nature a dreamer, had expended so much energy in\nproduction, in study, and in work under Lisbeth's despotic rule, that\nlove and happiness resulted in reaction. His real character reappeared,\nthe weakness, recklessness, and indolence of the Sarmatian returned to\nnestle in the comfortable corners of his soul, whence the schoolmaster's\nrod had routed them.\n\nFor the first few months the artist adored his wife. Hortense and\nWenceslas abandoned themselves to the happy childishness of a legitimate\nand unbounded passion. Hortense was the first to release her husband\nfrom his labors, proud to triumph over her rival, his Art. And, indeed,\na woman's caresses scare away the Muse, and break down the sturdy,\nbrutal resolution of the worker.\n\nSix or seven months slipped by, and the artist's fingers had forgotten\nthe use of the modeling tool. When the need for work began to be\nfelt, when the Prince de Wissembourg, president of the committee of\nsubscribers, asked to see the statue, Wenceslas spoke the inevitable\nbyword of the idler, \"I am just going to work on it,\" and he lulled his\ndear Hortense with fallacious promises and the magnificent schemes of\nthe artist as he smokes. Hortense loved her poet more than ever; she\ndreamed of a sublime statue of Marshal Montcornet. Montcornet would\nbe the embodied ideal of bravery, the type of the cavalry officer, of\ncourage _a la Murat_. Yes, yes; at the mere sight of that statue all the\nEmperor's victories were to seem a foregone conclusion. And then such\nworkmanship! The pencil was accommodating and answered to the word.\n\nBy way of a statue the result was a delightful little Wenceslas.\n\nWhen the progress of affairs required that he should go to the studio\nat le Gros-Caillou to mould the clay and set up the life-size model,\nSteinbock found one day that the Prince's clock required his presence\nin the workshop of Florent and Chanor, where the figures were being\nfinished; or, again, the light was gray and dull; to-day he had\nbusiness to do, to-morrow they had a family dinner, to say nothing of\nindispositions of mind and body, and the days when he stayed at home to\ntoy with his adored wife.\n\nMarshal the Prince de Wissembourg was obliged to be angry to get the\nclay model finished; he declared that he must put the work into other\nhands. It was only by dint of endless complaints and much strong\nlanguage that the committee of subscribers succeeded in seeing the\nplaster-cast. Day after day Steinbock came home, evidently tired,\ncomplaining of this \"hodman's work\" and his own physical weakness.\nDuring that first year the household felt no pinch; the Countess\nSteinbock, desperately in love with her husband cursed the War Minister.\nShe went to see him; she told him that great works of art were not to be\nmanufactured like cannon; and that the State--like Louis XIV., Francis\nI., and Leo X.--ought to be at the beck and call of genius. Poor\nHortense, believing she held a Phidias in her embrace, had the sort of\nmotherly cowardice for her Wenceslas that is in every wife who carries\nher love to the pitch of idolatry.\n\n\"Do not be hurried,\" said she to her husband, \"our whole future life is\nbound up with that statue. Take your time and produce a masterpiece.\"\n\nShe would go to the studio, and then the enraptured Steinbock wasted\nfive hours out of seven in describing the statue instead of working at\nit. He thus spent eighteen months in finishing the design, which to him\nwas all-important.\n\nWhen the plaster was cast and the model complete, poor Hortense, who had\nlooked on at her husband's toil, seeing his health really suffer\nfrom the exertions which exhaust a sculptor's frame and arms and\nhands--Hortense thought the result admirable. Her father, who knew\nnothing of sculpture, and her mother, no less ignorant, lauded it as a\ntriumph; the War Minister came with them to see it, and, overruled by\nthem, expressed approval of the figure, standing as it did alone, in a\nfavorable light, thrown up against a green baize background.\n\nAlas! at the exhibition of 1841, the disapprobation of the public soon\ntook the form of abuse and mockery in the mouths of those who were\nindignant with the idol too hastily set up for worship. Stidmann tried\nto advise his friend, but was accused of jealousy. Every article in a\nnewspaper was to Hortense an outcry of envy. Stidmann, the best of\ngood fellows, got articles written, in which adverse criticism was\ncontravened, and it was pointed out that sculptors altered their works\nin translating the plaster into marble, and that the marble would be the\ntest.\n\n\"In reproducing the plaster sketch in marble,\" wrote Claude Vignon, \"a\nmasterpiece may be ruined, or a bad design made beautiful. The plaster\nis the manuscript, the marble is the book.\"\n\nSo in two years and a half Wenceslas had produced a statue and a son.\nThe child was a picture of beauty; the statue was execrable.\n\nThe clock for the Prince and the price of the statue paid off the young\ncouple's debts. Steinbock had acquired fashionable habits; he went to\nthe play, to the opera; he talked admirably about art; and in the eyes\nof the world he maintained his reputation as a great artist by his\npowers of conversation and criticism. There are many clever men in Paris\nwho spend their lives in talking themselves out, and are content with a\nsort of drawing-room celebrity. Steinbock, emulating these emasculated\nbut charming men, grew every day more averse to hard work. As soon as\nhe began a thing, he was conscious of all its difficulties, and the\ndiscouragement that came over him enervated his will. Inspiration, the\nfrenzy of intellectual procreation, flew swiftly away at the sight of\nthis effete lover.\n\nSculpture--like dramatic art--is at once the most difficult and the\neasiest of all arts. You have but to copy a model, and the task is\ndone; but to give it a soul, to make it typical by creating a man or\na woman--this is the sin of Prometheus. Such triumphs in the annals\nof sculpture may be counted, as we may count the few poets among\nmen. Michael Angelo, Michel Columb, Jean Goujon, Phidias, Praxiteles,\nPolycletes, Puget, Canova, Albert Durer, are the brothers of Milton,\nVirgil, Dante, Shakespeare, Tasso, Homer, and Moliere. And such an\nachievement is so stupendous that a single statue is enough to make a\nman immortal, as Figaro, Lovelace, and Manon Lescaut have immortalized\nBeaumarchais, Richardson, and the Abbe Prevost.\n\nSuperficial thinkers--and there are many in the artist world--have\nasserted that sculpture lives only by the nude, that it died with the\nGreeks, and that modern vesture makes it impossible. But, in the first\nplace, the Ancients have left sublime statues entirely clothed--the\n_Polyhymnia_, the _Julia_, and others, and we have not found one-tenth\nof all their works; and then, let any lover of art go to Florence and\nsee Michael Angelo's _Penseroso_, or to the Cathedral of Mainz, and\nbehold the _Virgin_ by Albert Durer, who has created a living woman\nout of ebony, under her threefold drapery, with the most flowing,\nthe softest hair that ever a waiting-maid combed through; let all the\nignorant flock thither, and they will acknowledge that genius can give\nmind to drapery, to armor, to a robe, and fill it with a body, just as\na man leaves the stamp of his individuality and habits of life on the\nclothes he wears.\n\nSculpture is the perpetual realization of the fact which once, and never\nagain, was, in painting called Raphael!\n\nThe solution of this hard problem is to be found only in constant\npersevering toil; for, merely to overcome the material difficulties\nto such an extent, the hand must be so practised, so dexterous and\nobedient, that the sculptor may be free to struggle soul to soul with\nthe elusive moral element that he has to transfigure as he embodies it.\nIf Paganini, who uttered his soul through the strings of his violin,\nspent three days without practising, he lost what he called the _stops_\nof his instrument, meaning the sympathy between the wooden frame, the\nstrings, the bow, and himself; if he had lost this alliance, he would\nhave been no more than an ordinary player.\n\nPerpetual work is the law of art, as it is the law of life, for art is\nidealized creation. Hence great artists and perfect poets wait neither\nfor commission nor for purchasers. They are constantly creating--to-day,\nto-morrow, always. The result is the habit of work, the unfailing\napprehension of the difficulties which keep them in close intercourse\nwith the Muse and her productive forces. Canova lived in his studio, as\nVoltaire lived in his study; and so must Homer and Phidias have lived.\n\nWhile Lisbeth kept Wenceslas Steinbock in thraldom in his garret, he was\non the thorny road trodden by all these great men, which leads to the\nAlpine heights of glory. Then happiness, in the person of Hortense, had\nreduced the poet to idleness--the normal condition of all artists, since\nto them idleness is fully occupied. Their joy is such as that of the\npasha of a seraglio; they revel with ideas, they get drunk at the founts\nof intellect. Great artists, such as Steinbock, wrapped in reverie, are\nrightly spoken of as dreamers. They, like opium-eaters, all sink into\npoverty, whereas if they had been kept up to the mark by the stern\ndemands of life, they might have been great men.\n\nAt the same time, these half-artists are delightful; men like them and\ncram them with praise; they even seem superior to the true artists, who\nare taxed with conceit, unsociableness, contempt of the laws of society.\nThis is why: Great men are the slaves of their work. Their indifference\nto outer things, their devotion to their work, make simpletons regard\nthem as egotists, and they are expected to wear the same garb as the\ndandy who fulfils the trivial evolutions called social duties. These\nmen want the lions of the Atlas to be combed and scented like a lady's\npoodle.\n\nThese artists, who are too rarely matched to meet their fellows, fall\ninto habits of solitary exclusiveness; they are inexplicable to the\nmajority, which, as we know, consists mostly of fools--of the envious,\nthe ignorant, and the superficial.\n\nNow you may imagine what part a wife should play in the life of these\nglorious and exceptional beings. She ought to be what, for five years,\nLisbeth had been, but with the added offering of love, humble and\npatient love, always ready and always smiling.\n\nHortense, enlightened by her anxieties as a mother, and driven by\ndire necessity, had discovered too late the mistakes she had been\ninvoluntarily led into by her excessive love. Still, the worthy daughter\nof her mother, her heart ached at the thought of worrying Wenceslas;\nshe loved her dear poet too much to become his torturer; and she could\nforesee the hour when beggary awaited her, her child, and her husband.\n\n\"Come, come, my child,\" said Lisbeth, seeing the tears in her cousin's\nlovely eyes, \"you must not despair. A glassful of tears will not buy a\nplate of soup. How much do you want?\"\n\n\"Well, five or six thousand francs.\"\n\n\"I have but three thousand at the most,\" said Lisbeth. \"And what is\nWenceslas doing now?\"\n\n\"He has had an offer to work in partnership with Stidmann at a table\nservice for the Duc d'Herouville for six thousand francs. Then Monsieur\nChanor will advance four thousand to repay Monsieur de Lora and\nBridau--a debt of honor.\"\n\n\"What, you have had the money for the statue and the bas-reliefs for\nMarshal Montcornet's monument, and you have not paid them yet?\"\n\n\"For the last three years,\" said Hortense, \"we have spent twelve\nthousand francs a year, and I have but a hundred louis a year of my own.\nThe Marshal's monument, when all the expenses were paid, brought us no\nmore than sixteen thousand francs. Really and truly, if Wenceslas gets\nno work, I do not know what is to become of us. Oh, if only I could\nlearn to make statues, I would handle the clay!\" she cried, holding up\nher fine arms.\n\nThe woman, it was plain, fulfilled the promise of the girl; there was\na flash in her eye; impetuous blood, strong with iron, flowed in her\nveins; she felt that she was wasting her energy in carrying her infant.\n\n\"Ah, my poor little thing! a sensible girl should not marry an artist\ntill his fortune is made--not while it is still to make.\"\n\nAt this moment they heard voices; Stidmann and Wenceslas were seeing\nChanor to the door; then Wenceslas and Stidmann came in again.\n\nStidmann, an artist in vogue in the world of journalists, famous\nactresses, and courtesans of the better class, was a young man of\nfashion whom Valerie much wished to see in her rooms; indeed, he had\nalready been introduced to her by Claude Vignon. Stidmann had lately\nbroken off an intimacy with Madame Schontz, who had married some months\nsince and gone to live in the country. Valerie and Lisbeth, hearing of\nthis upheaval from Claude Vignon, thought it well to get Steinbock's\nfriend to visit in the Rue Vanneau.\n\nStidmann, out of good feeling, went rarely to the Steinbocks'; and as it\nhappened that Lisbeth was not present when he was introduced by Claude\nVignon, she now saw him for the first time. As she watched this noted\nartist, she caught certain glances from his eyes at Hortense, which\nsuggested to her the possibility of offering him to the Countess\nSteinbock as a consolation if Wenceslas should be false to her. In point\nof fact, Stidmann was reflecting that if Steinbock were not his friend,\nHortense, the young and superbly beautiful countess, would be an\nadorable mistress; it was this very notion, controlled by honor, that\nkept him away from the house. Lisbeth was quick to mark the significant\nawkwardness that troubles a man in the presence of a woman with whom he\nwill not allow himself to flirt.\n\n\"Very good-looking--that young man,\" said she in a whisper to Hortense.\n\n\"Oh, do you think so?\" she replied. \"I never noticed him.\"\n\n\"Stidmann, my good fellow,\" said Wenceslas, in an undertone to his\nfriend, \"we are on no ceremony, you and I--we have some business to\nsettle with this old girl.\"\n\nStidmann bowed to the ladies and went away.\n\n\"It is settled,\" said Wenceslas, when he came in from taking leave of\nStidmann. \"But there are six months' work to be done, and we must live\nmeanwhile.\"\n\n\"There are my diamonds,\" cried the young Countess, with the impetuous\nheroism of a loving woman.\n\nA tear rose in Wenceslas' eye.\n\n\"Oh, I am going to work,\" said he, sitting down by his wife and drawing\nher on to his knee. \"I will do odd jobs--a wedding chest, bronze\ngroups----\"\n\n\"But, my children,\" said Lisbeth; \"for, as you know, you will be\nmy heirs, and I shall leave you a very comfortable sum, believe me,\nespecially if you help me to marry the Marshal; nay, if we succeed in\nthat quickly, I will take you all to board with me--you and Adeline. We\nshould live very happily together.--But for the moment, listen to the\nvoice of my long experience. Do not fly to the Mont-de-Piete; it is the\nruin of the borrower. I have always found that when the interest was\ndue, those who had pledged their things had nothing wherewith to pay up,\nand then all is lost. I can get you a loan at five per cent on your note\nof hand.\"\n\n\"Oh, we are saved!\" said Hortense.\n\n\"Well, then, child, Wenceslas had better come with me to see the lender,\nwho will oblige him at my request. It is Madame Marneffe. If you flatter\nher a little--for she is as vain as a _parvenue_--she will get you out\nof the scrape in the most obliging way. Come yourself and see her, my\ndear Hortense.\"\n\nHortense looked at her husband with the expression a man condemned to\ndeath must wear on his way to the scaffold.\n\n\"Claude Vignon took Stidmann there,\" said Wenceslas. \"He says it is a\nvery pleasant house.\"\n\nHortense's head fell. What she felt can only be expressed in one word;\nit was not pain; it was illness.\n\n\"But, my dear Hortense, you must learn something of life!\" exclaimed\nLisbeth, understanding the eloquence of her cousin's looks. \"Otherwise,\nlike your mother, you will find yourself abandoned in a deserted room,\nwhere you will weep like Calypso on the departure of Ulysses, and at an\nage when there is no hope of Telemachus--\" she added, repeating a jest\nof Madame Marneffe's. \"We have to regard the people in the world as\ntools which we can make use of or let alone, according as they can serve\nour turn. Make use of Madame Marneffe now, my dears, and let her alone\nby and by. Are you afraid lest Wenceslas, who worships you, should fall\nin love with a woman four or five years older than himself, as yellow as\na bundle of field peas, and----?\"\n\n\"I would far rather pawn my diamonds,\" said Hortense. \"Oh, never go\nthere, Wenceslas!--It is hell!\"\n\n\"Hortense is right,\" said Steinbock, kissing his wife.\n\n\"Thank you, my dearest,\" said Hortense, delighted. \"My husband is an\nangel, you see, Lisbeth. He does not gamble, he goes nowhere without me;\nif he only could stick to work--oh, I should be too happy. Why take us\non show to my father's mistress, a woman who is ruining him and is the\ncause of troubles that are killing my heroic mother?\"\n\n\"My child, that is not where the cause of your father's ruin lies. It\nwas his singer who ruined him, and then your marriage!\" replied her\ncousin. \"Bless me! why, Madame Marneffe is of the greatest use to him.\nHowever, I must tell no tales.\"\n\n\"You have a good word for everybody, dear Betty--\"\n\nHortense was called into the garden by hearing the child cry; Lisbeth\nwas left alone with Wenceslas.\n\n\"You have an angel for your wife, Wenceslas!\" said she. \"Love her as you\nought; never give her cause for grief.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, I love her so well that I do not tell her all,\" replied\nWenceslas; \"but to you, Lisbeth, I may confess the truth.--If I took my\nwife's diamonds to the Monte-de-Piete, we should be no further forward.\"\n\n\"Then borrow of Madame Marneffe,\" said Lisbeth. \"Persuade Hortense,\nWenceslas, to let you go there, or else, bless me! go there without\ntelling her.\"\n\n\"That is what I was thinking of,\" replied Wenceslas, \"when I refused for\nfear of grieving Hortense.\"\n\n\"Listen to me; I care too much for you both not to warn you of your\ndanger. If you go there, hold your heart tight in both hands, for\nthe woman is a witch. All who see her adore her; she is so wicked, so\ninviting! She fascinates men like a masterpiece. Borrow her money, but\ndo not leave your soul in pledge. I should never be happy again if you\nwere false to Hortense--here she is! not another word! I will settle the\nmatter.\"\n\n\"Kiss Lisbeth, my darling,\" said Wenceslas to his wife. \"She will help\nus out of our difficulties by lending us her savings.\"\n\nAnd he gave Lisbeth a look which she understood.\n\n\"Then, I hope you mean to work, my dear treasure,\" said Hortense.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said the artist. \"I will begin to-morrow.\"\n\n\"To-morrow is our ruin!\" said his wife, with a smile.\n\n\"Now, my dear child! say yourself whether some hindrance has not come in\nthe way every day; some obstacle or business?\"\n\n\"Yes, very true, my love.\"\n\n\"Here!\" cried Steinbock, striking his brow, \"here I have swarms of\nideas! I mean to astonish all my enemies. I am going to design a service\nin the German style of the sixteenth century; the romantic style:\nfoliage twined with insects, sleeping children, newly invented monsters,\nchimeras--real chimeras, such as we dream of!--I see it all! It will be\nundercut, light, and yet crowded. Chanor was quite amazed.--And I wanted\nsome encouragement, for the last article on Montcornet's monument had\nbeen crushing.\"\n\nAt a moment in the course of the day when Lisbeth and Wenceslas were\nleft together, the artist agreed to go on the morrow to see Madame\nMarneffe--he either would win his wife's consent, or he would go without\ntelling her.\n\n\n\nValerie, informed the same evening of this success, insisted that Hulot\nshould go to invite Stidmann, Claude Vignon, and Steinbock to dinner;\nfor she was beginning to tyrannize over him as women of that type\ntyrannize over old men, who trot round town, and go to make interest\nwith every one who is necessary to the interests or the vanity of their\ntask-mistress.\n\nNext evening Valerie armed herself for conquest by making such a toilet\nas a Frenchwoman can devise when she wishes to make the most of herself.\nShe studied her appearance in this great work as a man going out to\nfight a duel practises his feints and lunges. Not a speck, not a wrinkle\nwas to be seen. Valerie was at her whitest, her softest, her sweetest.\nAnd certain little \"patches\" attracted the eye.\n\nIt is commonly supposed that the patch of the eighteenth century is out\nof date or out of fashion; that is a mistake. In these days women, more\ningenious perhaps than of yore, invite a glance through the opera-glass\nby other audacious devices. One is the first to hit on a rosette in\nher hair with a diamond in the centre, and she attracts every eye for a\nwhole evening; another revives the hair-net, or sticks a dagger through\nthe twist to suggest a garter; this one wears velvet bands round her\nwrists, that one appears in lace lippets. These valiant efforts, an\nAusterlitz of vanity or of love, then set the fashion for lower spheres\nby the time the inventive creatress has originated something new. This\nevening, which Valerie meant to be a success for her, she had placed\nthree patches. She had washed her hair with some lye, which changed\nits hue for a few days from a gold color to a duller shade. Madame\nSteinbock's was almost red, and she would be in every point unlike her.\nThis new effect gave her a piquant and strange appearance, which puzzled\nher followers so much, that Montes asked her:\n\n\"What have you done to yourself this evening?\"--Then she put on a rather\nwide black velvet neck-ribbon, which showed off the whiteness of her\nskin. One patch took the place of the _assassine_ of our grandmothers.\nAnd Valerie pinned the sweetest rosebud into her bodice, just in the\nmiddle above the stay-busk, and in the daintiest little hollow! It was\nenough to make every man under thirty drop his eyelids.\n\n\"I am as sweet as a sugar-plum,\" said she to herself, going through her\nattitudes before the glass, exactly as a dancer practises her curtesies.\n\nLisbeth had been to market, and the dinner was to be one of those\nsuperfine meals which Mathurine had been wont to cook for her Bishop\nwhen he entertained the prelate of the adjoining diocese.\n\nStidmann, Claude Vignon, and Count Steinbock arrived almost together,\njust at six. An ordinary, or, if you will, a natural woman would have\nhastened at the announcement of a name so eagerly longed for; but\nValerie, though ready since five o'clock, remained in her room, leaving\nher three guests together, certain that she was the subject of their\nconversation or of their secret thoughts. She herself had arranged\nthe drawing-room, laying out the pretty trifles produced in Paris and\nnowhere else, which reveal the woman and announce her presence: albums\nbound in enamel or embroidered with beads, saucers full of pretty rings,\nmarvels of Sevres or Dresden mounted exquisitely by Florent and Chanor,\nstatues, books, all the frivolities which cost insane sums, and which\npassion orders of the makers in its first delirium--or to patch up its\nlast quarrel.\n\nBesides, Valerie was in the state of intoxication that comes of triumph.\nShe had promised to marry Crevel if Marneffe should die; and the amorous\nCrevel had transferred to the name of Valerie Fortin bonds bearing ten\nthousand francs a year, the sum-total of what he had made in railway\nspeculations during the past three years, the returns on the capital of\na hundred thousand crowns which he had at first offered to the Baronne\nHulot. So Valerie now had an income of thirty-two thousand francs.\n\nCrevel had just committed himself to a promise of far greater magnitude\nthan this gift of his surplus. In the paroxysm of rapture which _his\nDuchess_ had given him from two to four--he gave this fine title to\nMadame _de_ Marneffe to complete the illusion--for Valerie had surpassed\nherself in the Rue du Dauphin that afternoon, he had thought well to\nencourage her in her promised fidelity by giving her the prospect of\na certain little mansion, built in the Rue Barbette by an imprudent\ncontractor, who now wanted to sell it. Valerie could already see herself\nin this delightful residence, with a fore-court and a garden, and\nkeeping a carriage!\n\n\"What respectable life can ever procure so much in so short a time, or\nso easily?\" said she to Lisbeth as she finished dressing. Lisbeth was to\ndine with Valerie that evening, to tell Steinbock those things about the\nlady which nobody can say about herself.\n\nMadame Marneffe, radiant with satisfaction, came into the drawing-room\nwith modest grace, followed by Lisbeth dressed in black and yellow to\nset her off.\n\n\"Good-evening, Claude,\" said she, giving her hand to the famous old\ncritic.\n\nClaude Vignon, like many another, had become a political personage--a\nword describing an ambitious man at the first stage of his career. The\n_political personage_ of 1840 represents, in some degree, the _Abbe_ of\nthe eighteenth century. No drawing-room circle is complete without one.\n\n\"My dear, this is my cousin, Count Steinbock,\" said Lisbeth, introducing\nWenceslas, whom Valerie seemed to have overlooked.\n\n\"Oh yes, I recognized Monsieur le Comte,\" replied Valerie with a\ngracious bow to the artist. \"I often saw you in the Rue du Doyenne,\nand I had the pleasure of being present at your wedding.--It would be\ndifficult, my dear,\" said she to Lisbeth, \"to forget your adopted son\nafter once seeing him.--It is most kind of you, Monsieur Stidmann,\"\nshe went on, \"to have accepted my invitation at such short notice;\nbut necessity knows no law. I knew you to be the friend of both these\ngentlemen. Nothing is more dreary, more sulky, than a dinner where all\nthe guests are strangers, so it was for their sake that I hailed you\nin--but you will come another time for mine, I hope?--Say that you\nwill.\"\n\nAnd for a few minutes she moved about the room with Stidmann, wholly\noccupied with him.\n\nCrevel and Hulot were announced separately, and then a deputy named\nBeauvisage.\n\nThis individual, a provincial Crevel, one of the men created to make\nup the crowd in the world, voted under the banner of Giraud, a State\nCouncillor, and Victorin Hulot. These two politicians were trying to\nform a nucleus of progressives in the loose array of the Conservative\nParty. Giraud himself occasionally spent the evening at Madame\nMarneffe's, and she flattered herself that she should also capture\nVictorin Hulot; but the puritanical lawyer had hitherto found excuses\nfor refusing to accompany his father and father-in-law. It seemed to\nhim criminal to be seen in the house of the woman who cost his mother so\nmany tears. Victorin Hulot was to the puritans of political life what a\npious woman is among bigots.\n\nBeauvisage, formerly a stocking manufacturer at Arcis, was anxious to\n_pick up the Paris style_. This man, one of the outer stones of the\nChamber, was forming himself under the auspices of this delicious and\nfascinating Madame Marneffe. Introduced here by Crevel, he had accepted\nhim, at her instigation, as his model and master. He consulted him on\nevery point, took the address of his tailor, imitated him, and tried to\nstrike the same attitudes. In short, Crevel was his Great Man.\n\nValerie, surrounded by these bigwigs and the three artists, and\nsupported by Lisbeth, struck Wenceslas as a really superior woman, all\nthe more so because Claude Vignon spoke of her like a man in love.\n\n\"She is Madame de Maintenon in Ninon's petticoats!\" said the veteran\ncritic. \"You may please her in an evening if you have the wit; but\nas for making her love you--that would be a triumph to crown a man's\nambition and fill up his life.\"\n\nValerie, while seeming cold and heedless of her former neighbor, piqued\nhis vanity, quite unconsciously indeed, for she knew nothing of the\nPolish character. There is in the Slav a childish element, as there\nis in all these primitively wild nations which have overflowed into\ncivilization rather than that they have become civilized. The race has\nspread like an inundation, and has covered a large portion of the globe.\nIt inhabits deserts whose extent is so vast that it expands at its ease;\nthere is no jostling there, as there is in Europe, and civilization is\nimpossible without the constant friction of minds and interests. The\nUkraine, Russia, the plains by the Danube, in short, the Slav nations,\nare a connecting link between Europe and Asia, between civilization and\nbarbarism. Thus the Pole, the wealthiest member of the Slav family, has\nin his character all the childishness and inconsistency of a\nbeardless race. He has courage, spirit, and strength; but, cursed with\ninstability, that courage, strength, and energy have neither method nor\nguidance; for the Pole displays a variability resembling that of the\nwinds which blow across that vast plain broken with swamps; and though\nhe has the impetuosity of the snow squalls that wrench and sweep away\nbuildings, like those aerial avalanches he is lost in the first pool and\nmelts into water. Man always assimilates something from the surroundings\nin which he lives. Perpetually at strife with the Turk, the Pole has\nimbibed a taste for Oriental splendor; he often sacrifices what is\nneedful for the sake of display. The men dress themselves out like\nwomen, yet the climate has given them the tough constitution of Arabs.\n\nThe Pole, sublime in suffering, has tired his oppressors' arms by sheer\nendurance of beating; and, in the nineteenth century, has reproduced the\nspectacle presented by the early Christians. Infuse only ten per cent\nof English cautiousness into the frank and open Polish nature, and\nthe magnanimous white eagle would at this day be supreme wherever\nthe two-headed eagle has sneaked in. A little Machiavelism would have\nhindered Poland from helping to save Austria, who has taken a share of\nit; from borrowing from Prussia, the usurer who had undermined it; and\nfrom breaking up as soon as a division was first made.\n\nAt the christening of Poland, no doubt, the Fairy Carabosse, overlooked\nby the genii who endowed that attractive people with the most brilliant\ngifts, came in to say:\n\n\"Keep all the gifts that my sisters have bestowed on you; but you shall\nnever know what you wish for!\"\n\nIf, in its heroic duel with Russia, Poland had won the day, the Poles\nwould now be fighting among themselves, as they formerly fought in their\nDiets to hinder each other from being chosen King. When that nation,\ncomposed entirely of hot-headed dare-devils, has good sense enough to\nseek a Louis XI. among her own offspring, to accept his despotism and a\ndynasty, she will be saved.\n\nWhat Poland has been politically, almost every Pole is in private life,\nespecially under the stress of disaster. Thus Wenceslas Steinbock, after\nworshiping his wife for three years and knowing that he was a god to\nher, was so much nettled at finding himself barely noticed by Madame\nMarneffe, that he made it a point of honor to attract her attention.\nHe compared Valerie with his wife and gave her the palm. Hortense was\nbeautiful flesh, as Valerie had said to Lisbeth; but Madame Marneffe had\nspirit in her very shape, and the savor of vice.\n\nSuch devotion as Hortense's is a feeling which a husband takes as his\ndue; the sense of the immense preciousness of such perfect love soon\nwears off, as a debtor, in the course of time, begins to fancy that the\nborrowed money is his own. This noble loyalty becomes the daily bread of\nthe soul, and an infidelity is as tempting as a dainty. The woman who\nis scornful, and yet more the woman who is reputed dangerous, excites\ncuriosity, as spices add flavor to good food. Indeed, the disdain so\ncleverly acted by Valerie was a novelty to Wenceslas, after three years\nof too easy enjoyment. Hortense was a wife; Valerie a mistress.\n\nMany men desire to have two editions of the same work, though it is in\nfact a proof of inferiority when a man cannot make his mistress of his\nwife. Variety in this particular is a sign of weakness. Constancy will\nalways be the real genius of love, the evidence of immense power--the\npower that makes the poet! A man ought to find every woman in his wife,\nas the squalid poets of the seventeenth century made their Manons figure\nas Iris and Chloe.\n\n\"Well,\" said Lisbeth to the Pole, as she beheld him fascinated, \"what do\nyou think of Valerie?\"\n\n\"She is too charming,\" replied Wenceslas.\n\n\"You would not listen to me,\" said Betty. \"Oh! my little Wenceslas, if\nyou and I had never parted, you would have been that siren's lover; you\nmight have married her when she was a widow, and you would have had her\nforty thousand francs a year----\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Lisbeth. \"Now, take care of yourself; I warned you\nof the danger; do not singe your wings in the candle!--Come, give me\nyour arm, dinner is served.\"\n\nNo language could be so thoroughly demoralizing as this; for if you show\na Pole a precipice, he is bound to leap it. As a nation they have the\nvery spirit of cavalry; they fancy they can ride down every obstacle and\ncome out victorious. The spur applied by Lisbeth to Steinbock's vanity\nwas intensified by the appearance of the dining-room, bright with\nhandsome silver plate; the dinner was served with every refinement and\nextravagance of Parisian luxury.\n\n\"I should have done better to take Celimene,\" thought he to himself.\n\nAll through the dinner Hulot was charming; pleased to see his son-in-law\nat that table, and yet more happy in the prospect of a reconciliation\nwith Valerie, whose fidelity he proposed to secure by the promise of\nCoquet's head-clerkship. Stidmann responded to the Baron's amiability by\nshafts of Parisian banter and an artist's high spirits. Steinbock would\nnot allow himself to be eclipsed by his friend; he too was witty, said\namusing things, made his mark, and was pleased with himself; Madame\nMarneffe smiled at him several times to show that she quite understood\nhim.\n\nThe good meal and heady wines completed the work; Wenceslas was deep in\nwhat must be called the slough of dissipation. Excited by just a\nglass too much, he stretched himself on a settee after dinner, sunk\nin physical and mental ecstasy, which Madame Marneffe wrought to the\nhighest pitch by coming to sit down by him--airy, scented, pretty enough\nto damn an angel. She bent over Wenceslas and almost touched his ear as\nshe whispered to him:\n\n\"We cannot talk over business matters this evening, unless you will\nremain till the last. Between us--you, Lisbeth, and me--we can settle\neverything to suit you.\"\n\n\"Ah, Madame, you are an angel!\" replied Wenceslas, also in a murmur. \"I\nwas a pretty fool not to listen to Lisbeth--\"\n\n\"What did she say?\"\n\n\"She declared, in the Rue du Doyenne, that you loved me!\"\n\nMadame Marneffe looked at him, seemed covered with confusion, and\nhastily left her seat. A young and pretty woman never rouses the hope of\nimmediate success with impunity. This retreat, the impulse of a virtuous\nwoman who is crushing a passion in the depths of her heart, was a\nthousand times more effective than the most reckless avowal. Desire was\nso thoroughly aroused in Wenceslas that he doubled his attentions to\nValerie. A woman seen by all is a woman wished for. Hence the terrible\npower of actresses. Madame Marneffe, knowing that she was watched,\nbehaved like an admired actress. She was quite charming, and her success\nwas immense.\n\n\"I no longer wonder at my father-in-law's follies,\" said Steinbock to\nLisbeth.\n\n\"If you say such things, Wenceslas, I shall to my dying day repent of\nhaving got you the loan of these ten thousand francs. Are you, like\nall these men,\" and she indicated the guests, \"madly in love with that\ncreature? Remember, you would be your father-in-law's rival. And think\nof the misery you would bring on Hortense.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Wenceslas. \"Hortense is an angel; I should be a\nwretch.\"\n\n\"And one is enough in the family!\" said Lisbeth.\n\n\"Artists ought never to marry!\" exclaimed Steinbock.\n\n\"Ah! that is what I always told you in the Rue du Doyenne. Your groups,\nyour statues, your great works, ought to be your children.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" Valerie asked, joining Lisbeth.--\"Give us\ntea, Cousin.\"\n\nSteinbock, with Polish vainglory, wanted to appear familiar with this\ndrawing-room fairy. After defying Stidmann, Vignon, and Crevel with a\nlook, he took Valerie's hand and forced her to sit down by him on the\nsettee.\n\n\"You are rather too lordly, Count Steinbock,\" said she, resisting a\nlittle. But she laughed as she dropped on to the seat, not without\narranging the rosebud pinned into her bodice.\n\n\"Alas! if I were really lordly,\" said he, \"I should not be here to\nborrow money.\"\n\n\"Poor boy! I remember how you worked all night in the Rue du Doyenne.\nYou really were rather a spooney; you married as a starving man snatches\na loaf. You knew nothing of Paris, and you see where you are landed. But\nyou turned a deaf ear to Lisbeth's devotion, as you did to the love of a\nwoman who knows her Paris by heart.\"\n\n\"Say no more!\" cried Steinbock; \"I am done for!\"\n\n\"You shall have your ten thousand francs, my dear Wenceslas; but on one\ncondition,\" she went on, playing with his handsome curls.\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"I will take no interest----\"\n\n\"Madame!\"\n\n\"Oh, you need not be indignant; you shall make it good by giving me a\nbronze group. You began the story of Samson; finish it.--Do a Delilah\ncutting off the Jewish Hercules' hair. And you, who, if you will listen\nto me, will be a great artist, must enter into the subject. What you\nhave to show is the power of woman. Samson is a secondary consideration.\nHe is the corpse of dead strength. It is Delilah--passion--that ruins\neverything. How far more beautiful is that _replica_--That is what you\ncall it, I think--\" She skilfully interpolated, as Claude Vignon and\nStidmann came up to them on hearing her talk of sculpture--\"how far more\nbeautiful than the Greek myth is that _replica_ of Hercules at Omphale's\nfeet.--Did Greece copy Judaea, or did Judaea borrow the symbolism from\nGreece?\"\n\n\"There, madame, you raise an important question--that of the date of\nthe various writings in the Bible. The great and immortal Spinoza--most\nfoolishly ranked as an atheist, whereas he gave mathematical proof\nof the existence of God--asserts that the Book of Genesis and all\nthe political history of the Bible are of the time of Moses, and he\ndemonstrates the interpolated passages by philological evidence. And he\nwas thrice stabbed as he went into the synagogue.\"\n\n\"I had no idea I was so learned,\" said Valerie, annoyed at this\ninterruption to her _tete-a-tete_.\n\n\"Women know everything by instinct,\" replied Claude Vignon.\n\n\"Well, then, you promise me?\" she said to Steinbock, taking his hand\nwith the timidity of a girl in love.\n\n\"You are indeed a happy man, my dear fellow,\" cried Stidmann, \"if madame\nasks a favor of you!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Claude Vignon.\n\n\"A small bronze group,\" replied Steinbock, \"Delilah cutting off Samson's\nhair.\"\n\n\"It is difficult,\" remarked Vignon. \"A bed----\"\n\n\"On the contrary, it is exceedingly easy,\" replied Valerie, smiling.\n\n\"Ah ha! teach us sculpture!\" said Stidmann.\n\n\"You should take madame for your subject,\" replied Vignon, with a keen\nglance at Valerie.\n\n\"Well,\" she went on, \"this is my notion of the composition. Samson on\nwaking finds he has no hair, like many a dandy with a false top-knot.\nThe hero is sitting on the bed, so you need only show the foot of it,\ncovered with hangings and drapery. There he is, like Marius among\nthe ruins of Carthage, his arms folded, his head shaven--Napoleon at\nSaint-Helena--what you will! Delilah is on her knees, a good deal like\nCanova's Magdalen. When a hussy has ruined her man, she adores him. As I\nsee it, the Jewess was afraid of Samson in his strength and terrors, but\nshe must have loved him when she saw him a child again. So Delilah is\nbewailing her sin, she would like to give her lover his hair again. She\nhardly dares to look at him; but she does look, with a smile, for she\nreads forgiveness in Samson's weakness. Such a group as this, and one of\nthe ferocious Judith, would epitomize woman. Virtue cuts off your head;\nvice only cuts off your hair. Take care of your wigs, gentlemen!\"\n\nAnd she left the artists quite overpowered, to sing her praises in\nconcert with the critic.\n\n\"It is impossible to be more bewitching!\" cried Stidmann.\n\n\"Oh! she is the most intelligent and desirable woman I have ever met,\"\nsaid Claude Vignon. \"Such a combination of beauty and cleverness is so\nrare.\"\n\n\"And if you who had the honor of being intimate with Camille Maupin can\npronounce such a verdict,\" replied Stidmann, \"what are we to think?\"\n\n\"If you will make your Delilah a portrait of Valerie, my dear Count,\"\nsaid Crevel, who had risen for a moment from the card-table, and who\nhad heard what had been said, \"I will give you a thousand crowns for an\nexample--yes, by the Powers! I will shell out to the tune of a thousand\ncrowns!\"\n\n\"Shell out! What does that mean?\" asked Beauvisage of Claude Vignon.\n\n\"Madame must do me the honor to sit for it then,\" said Steinbock to\nCrevel. \"Ask her--\"\n\nAt this moment Valerie herself brought Steinbock a cup of tea. This was\nmore than a compliment, it was a favor. There is a complete language\nin the manner in which a woman does this little civility; but women\nare fully aware of the fact, and it is a curious thing to study their\nmovements, their manner, their look, tone, and accent when they perform\nthis apparently simple act of politeness.--From the question, \"Do you\ntake tea?\"--\"Will you have some tea?\"--\"A cup of tea?\" coldly asked,\nand followed by instructions to the nymph of the urn to bring it, to the\neloquent poem of the odalisque coming from the tea-table, cup in hand,\ntowards the pasha of her heart, presenting it submissively, offering it\nin an insinuating voice, with a look full of intoxicating promises,\na physiologist could deduce the whole scale of feminine emotion, from\naversion or indifference to Phaedra's declaration to Hippolytus. Women\ncan make it, at will, contemptuous to the verge of insult, or humble to\nthe expression of Oriental servility.\n\nAnd Valerie was more than woman; she was the serpent made woman; she\ncrowned her diabolical work by going up to Steinbock, a cup of tea in\nher hand.\n\n\"I will drink as many cups of tea as you will give me,\" said the artist,\nmurmuring in her ear as he rose, and touching her fingers with his, \"to\nhave them given to me thus!\"\n\n\"What were you saying about sitting?\" said she, without betraying that\nthis declaration, so frantically desired, had gone straight to her\nheart.\n\n\"Old Crevel promises me a thousand crowns for a copy of your group.\"\n\n\"He! a thousand crowns for a bronze group?\"\n\n\"Yes--if you will sit for Delilah,\" said Steinbock.\n\n\"He will not be there to see, I hope!\" replied she. \"The group would\nbe worth more than all his fortune, for Delilah's costume is rather\nun-dressy.\"\n\nJust as Crevel loved to strike an attitude, every woman has a victorious\ngesture, a studied movement, which she knows must win admiration. You\nmay see in a drawing-room how one spends all her time looking down at\nher tucker or pulling up the shoulder-piece of her gown, how another\nmakes play with the brightness of her eyes by glancing up at the\ncornice. Madame Marneffe's triumph, however, was not face to face like\nthat of other women. She turned sharply round to return to Lisbeth at\nthe tea-table. This ballet-dancer's pirouette, whisking her skirts, by\nwhich she had overthrown Hulot, now fascinated Steinbock.\n\n\"Your vengeance is secure,\" said Valerie to Lisbeth in a whisper.\n\"Hortense will cry out all her tears, and curse the day when she robbed\nyou of Wenceslas.\"\n\n\"Till I am Madame la Marechale I shall not think myself successful,\"\nreplied the cousin; \"but they are all beginning to wish for it.--This\nmorning I went to Victorin's--I forgot to tell you.--The young Hulots\nhave bought up their father's notes of hand given to Vauvinet, and\nto-morrow they will endorse a bill for seventy-two thousand francs at\nfive per cent, payable in three years, and secured by a mortgage on\ntheir house. So the young people are in straits for three years;\nthey can raise no more money on that property. Victorin is dreadfully\ndistressed; he understands his father. And Crevel is capable of refusing\nto see them; he will be so angry at this piece of self-sacrifice.\"\n\n\"The Baron cannot have a sou now,\" said Valerie, and she smiled at\nHulot.\n\n\"I don't see where he can get it. But he will draw his salary again in\nSeptember.\"\n\n\"And he has his policy of insurance; he has renewed it. Come, it is\nhigh time he should get Marneffe promoted. I will drive it home this\nevening.\"\n\n\"My dear cousin,\" said Lisbeth to Wenceslas, \"go home, I beg. You are\nquite ridiculous. Your eyes are fixed on Valerie in a way that is enough\nto compromise her, and her husband is insanely jealous. Do not tread in\nyour father-in-law's footsteps. Go home; I am sure Hortense is sitting\nup for you.\"\n\n\"Madame Marneffe told me to stay till the last to settle my little\nbusiness with you and her,\" replied Wenceslas.\n\n\"No, no,\" said Lisbeth; \"I will bring you the ten thousand francs, for\nher husband has his eye on you. It would be rash to remain. To-morrow\nat eleven o'clock bring your note of hand; at that hour that mandarin\nMarneffe is at his office, Valerie is free.--Have you really asked her\nto sit for your group?--Come up to my rooms first.--Ah! I was sure\nof it,\" she added, as she caught the look which Steinbock flashed at\nValerie, \"I knew you were a profligate in the bud! Well, Valerie is\nlovely--but try not to bring trouble on Hortense.\"\n\n\n\nNothing annoys a married man so much as finding his wife perpetually\ninterposing between himself and his wishes, however transient.\n\nWenceslas got home at about one in the morning; Hortense had expected\nhim ever since half-past nine. From half-past nine till ten she had\nlistened to the passing carriages, telling herself that never before had\nher husband come in so late from dining with Florent and Chanor. She sat\nsewing by the child's cot, for she had begun to save a needlewoman's pay\nfor the day by doing the mending herself.--From ten till half-past, a\nsuspicion crossed her mind; she sat wondering:\n\n\"Is he really gone to dinner, as he told me, with Chanor and Florent? He\nput on his best cravat and his handsomest pin when he dressed. He took\nas long over his toilet as a woman when she wants to make the best of\nherself.--I am crazy! He loves me!--And here he is!\"\n\nBut instead of stopping, the cab she heard went past.\n\nFrom eleven till midnight Hortense was a victim to terrible alarms; the\nquarter where they lived was now deserted.\n\n\"If he has set out on foot, some accident may have happened,\" thought\nshe. \"A man may be killed by tumbling over a curbstone or failing to\nsee a gap. Artists are so heedless! Or if he should have been stopped\nby robbers!--It is the first time he has ever left me alone here for six\nhours and a half!--But why should I worry myself? He cares for no one\nbut me.\"\n\nMen ought to be faithful to the wives who love them, were it only on\naccount of the perpetual miracles wrought by true love in the sublime\nregions of the spiritual world. The woman who loves is, in relation\nto the man she loves, in the position of a somnambulist to whom the\nmagnetizer should give the painful power, when she ceases to be the\nmirror of the world, of being conscious as a woman of what she has seen\nas a somnambulist. Passion raises the nervous tension of a woman to the\necstatic pitch at which presentiment is as acute as the insight of a\nclairvoyant. A wife knows she is betrayed; she will not let herself say\nso, she doubts still--she loves so much! She gives the lie to the outcry\nof her own Pythian power. This paroxysm of love deserves a special form\nof worship.\n\nIn noble souls, admiration of this divine phenomenon will always be a\nsafeguard to protect them from infidelity. How should a man not worship\na beautiful and intellectual creature whose soul can soar to such\nmanifestations?\n\nBy one in the morning Hortense was in a state of such intense anguish,\nthat she flew to the door as she recognized her husband's ring at the\nbell, and clasped him in her arms like a mother.\n\n\"At last--here you are!\" cried she, finding her voice again. \"My\ndearest, henceforth where you go I go, for I cannot again endure the\ntorture of such waiting.--I pictured you stumbling over a curbstone,\nwith a fractured skull! Killed by thieves!--No, a second time I know I\nshould go mad.--Have you enjoyed yourself so much?--And without me!--Bad\nboy!\"\n\n\"What can I say, my darling? There was Bixiou, who drew fresh\ncaricatures for us; Leon de Lora, as witty as ever; Claude Vignon, to\nwhom I owe the only consolatory article that has come out about the\nMontcornet statue. There were--\"\n\n\"Were there no ladies?\" Hortense eagerly inquired.\n\n\"Worthy Madame Florent--\"\n\n\"You said the Rocher de Cancale.--Were you at the Florents'?\"\n\n\"Yes, at their house; I made a mistake.\"\n\n\"You did not take a coach to come home?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And you have walked from the Rue des Tournelles?\"\n\n\"Stidmann and Bixiou came back with me along the boulevards as far as\nthe Madeleine, talking all the way.\"\n\n\"It is dry then on the boulevards and the Place de la Concorde and the\nRue de Bourgogne? You are not muddy at all!\" said Hortense, looking at\nher husband's patent leather boots.\n\nIt had been raining, but between the Rue Vanneau and the Rue\nSaint-Dominique Wenceslas had not got his boots soiled.\n\n\"Here--here are five thousand francs Chanor has been so generous as to\nlend me,\" said Wenceslas, to cut short this lawyer-like examination.\n\nHe had made a division of the ten thousand-franc notes, half for\nHortense and half for himself, for he had five thousand francs' worth of\ndebts of which Hortense knew nothing. He owed money to his foreman and\nhis workmen.\n\n\"Now your anxieties are relieved,\" said he, kissing his wife. \"I am\ngoing to work to-morrow morning. So I am going to bed this minute to get\nup early, by your leave, my pet.\"\n\nThe suspicion that had dawned in Hortense's mind vanished; she was miles\naway from the truth. Madame Marneffe! She had never thought of her.\nHer fear for her Wenceslas was that he should fall in with street\nprostitutes. The names of Bixiou and Leon de Lora, two artists noted for\ntheir wild dissipations, had alarmed her.\n\nNext morning she saw Wenceslas go out at nine o'clock, and was quite\nreassured.\n\n\"Now he is at work again,\" said she to herself, as she proceeded to\ndress her boy. \"I see he is quite in the vein! Well, well, if we\ncannot have the glory of Michael Angelo, we may have that of Benvenuto\nCellini!\"\n\nLulled by her own hopes, Hortense believed in a happy future; and\nshe was chattering to her son of twenty months in the language of\nonomatopoeia that amuses babes when, at about eleven o'clock, the cook,\nwho had not seen Wenceslas go out, showed in Stidmann.\n\n\"I beg pardon, madame,\" said he. \"Is Wenceslas gone out already?\"\n\n\"He is at the studio.\"\n\n\"I came to talk over the work with him.\"\n\n\"I will send for him,\" said Hortense, offering Stidmann a chair.\n\nThanking Heaven for this piece of luck, Hortense was glad to detain\nStidmann to ask some questions about the evening before. Stidmann bowed\nin acknowledgment of her kindness. The Countess Steinbock rang; the cook\nappeared, and was desired to go at once and fetch her master from the\nstudio.\n\n\"You had an amusing dinner last night?\" said Hortense. \"Wenceslas did\nnot come in till past one in the morning.\"\n\n\"Amusing? not exactly,\" replied the artist, who had intended to\nfascinate Madame Marneffe. \"Society is not very amusing unless one is\ninterested in it. That little Madame Marneffe is clever, but a great\nflirt.\"\n\n\"And what did Wenceslas think of her?\" asked poor Hortense, trying to\nkeep calm. \"He said nothing about her to me.\"\n\n\"I will only say one thing,\" said Stidmann, \"and that is, that I think\nher a very dangerous woman.\"\n\nHortense turned as pale as a woman after childbirth.\n\n\"So--it was at--at Madame Marneffe's that you dined--and not--not with\nChanor?\" said she, \"yesterday--and Wenceslas--and he----\"\n\nStidmann, without knowing what mischief he had done, saw that he had\nblundered.\n\nThe Countess did not finish her sentence; she simply fainted away. The\nartist rang, and the maid came in. When Louise tried to get her mistress\ninto her bedroom, a serious nervous attack came on, with violent\nhysterics. Stidmann, like any man who by an involuntary indiscretion has\noverthrown the structure built on a husband's lie to his wife, could not\nconceive that his words should produce such an effect; he supposed\nthat the Countess was in such delicate health that the slightest\ncontradiction was mischievous.\n\nThe cook presently returned to say, unfortunately in loud tones, that\nher master was not in the studio. In the midst of her anguish, Hortense\nheard, and the hysterical fit came on again.\n\n\"Go and fetch madame's mother,\" said Louise to the cook. \"Quick--run!\"\n\n\"If I knew where to find Steinbock, I would go and fetch him!\" exclaimed\nStidmann in despair.\n\n\"He is with that woman!\" cried the unhappy wife. \"He was not dressed to\ngo to his work!\"\n\nStidmann hurried off to Madame Marneffe's, struck by the truth of this\nconclusion, due to the second-sight of passion.\n\nAt that moment Valerie was posed as Delilah. Stidmann, too sharp to ask\nfor Madame Marneffe, walked straight in past the lodge, and ran quickly\nup to the second floor, arguing thus: \"If I ask for Madame Marneffe, she\nwill be out. If I inquire point-blank for Steinbock, I shall be laughed\nat to my face.--Take the bull by the horns!\"\n\nReine appeared in answer to his ring.\n\n\"Tell Monsieur le Comte Steinbock to come at once, his wife is dying--\"\n\nReine, quite a match for Stidmann, looked at him with blank surprise.\n\n\"But, sir--I don't know--did you suppose----\"\n\n\"I tell you that my friend Monsieur Steinbock is here; his wife is very\nill. It is quite serious enough for you to disturb your mistress.\" And\nStidmann turned on his heel.\n\n\"He is there, sure enough!\" said he to himself.\n\nAnd in point of fact, after waiting a few minutes in the Rue Vanneau,\nhe saw Wenceslas come out, and beckoned to him to come quickly. After\ntelling him of the tragedy enacted in the Rue Saint-Dominique, Stidmann\nscolded Steinbock for not having warned him to keep the secret of\nyesterday's dinner.\n\n\"I am done for,\" said Wenceslas, \"but you are forgiven. I had totally\nforgotten that you were to call this morning, and I blundered in not\ntelling you that we were to have dined with Florent.--What can I say?\nThat Valerie has turned my head; but, my dear fellow, for her glory is\nwell lost, misfortune well won! She really is!--Good Heavens!--But I am\nin a dreadful fix. Advise me. What can I say? How can I excuse myself?\"\n\n\"I! advise you! I don't know,\" replied Stidmann. \"But your wife loves\nyou, I imagine? Well, then, she will believe anything. Tell her that you\nwere on your way to me when I was on my way to you; that, at any rate,\nwill set this morning's business right. Good-bye.\"\n\nLisbeth, called down by Reine, ran after Wenceslas and caught him up\nat the corner of the Rue Hillerin-Bertin; she was afraid of his Polish\nartlessness. Not wishing to be involved in the matter, she said a few\nwords to Wenceslas, who in his joy hugged her then and there. She had\nno doubt pushed out a plank to enable the artist to cross this awkward\nplace in his conjugal affairs.\n\nAt the sight of her mother, who had flown to her aid, Hortense burst\ninto floods of tears. This happily changed the character of the\nhysterical attack.\n\n\"Treachery, dear mamma!\" cried she. \"Wenceslas, after giving me his word\nof honor that he would not go near Madame Marneffe, dined with her last\nnight, and did not come in till a quarter-past one in the morning.--If\nyou only knew! The day before we had had a discussion, not a quarrel,\nand I had appealed to him so touchingly. I told him I was jealous, that\nI should die if he were unfaithful; that I was easily suspicious, but\nthat he ought to have some consideration for my weaknesses, as they came\nof my love for him; that I had my father's blood in my veins as well as\nyours; that at the first moment of such discovery I should be mad, and\ncapable of mad deeds--of avenging myself--of dishonoring us all, him,\nhis child, and myself; that I might even kill him first and myself\nafter--and so on.\n\n\"And yet he went there; he is there!--That woman is bent on breaking all\nour hearts! Only yesterday my brother and Celestine pledged their all\nto pay off seventy thousand francs on notes of hand signed for that\ngood-for-nothing creature.--Yes, mamma, my father would have been\narrested and put into prison. Cannot that dreadful woman be content with\nhaving my father, and with all your tears? Why take my Wenceslas?--I\nwill go to see her and stab her!\"\n\nMadame Hulot, struck to the heart by the dreadful secrets Hortense\nwas unwittingly letting out, controlled her grief by one of the heroic\nefforts which a magnanimous mother can make, and drew her daughter's\nhead on to her bosom to cover it with kisses.\n\n\"Wait for Wenceslas, my child; all will be explained. The evil cannot\nbe so great as you picture it!--I, too, have been deceived, my dear\nHortense; you think me handsome, I have lived blameless; and yet I have\nbeen utterly forsaken for three-and-twenty years--for a Jenny Cadine, a\nJosepha, a Madame Marneffe!--Did you know that?\"\n\n\"You, mamma, you! You have endured this for twenty----\"\n\nShe broke off, staggered by her own thoughts.\n\n\"Do as I have done, my child,\" said her mother. \"Be gentle and kind, and\nyour conscience will be at peace. On his death-bed a man may say, 'My\nwife has never cost me a pang!' And God, who hears that dying breath,\ncredits it to us. If I had abandoned myself to fury like you, what would\nhave happened? Your father would have been embittered, perhaps he would\nhave left me altogether, and he would not have been withheld by any fear\nof paining me. Our ruin, utter as it now is, would have been complete\nten years sooner, and we should have shown the world the spectacle of\na husband and wife living quite apart--a scandal of the most horrible,\nheart-breaking kind, for it is the destruction of the family. Neither\nyour brother nor you could have married.\n\n\"I sacrificed myself, and that so bravely, that, till this last\nconnection of your father's, the world has believed me happy. My\nserviceable and indeed courageous falsehood has, till now, screened\nHector; he is still respected; but this old man's passion is taking him\ntoo far, that I see. His own folly, I fear, will break through the veil\nI have kept between the world and our home. However, I have held\nthat curtain steady for twenty-three years, and have wept behind\nit--motherless, I, without a friend to trust, with no help but in\nreligion--I have for twenty-three years secured the family honor----\"\n\nHortense listened with a fixed gaze. The calm tone of resignation and\nof such crowning sorrow soothed the smart of her first wound; the tears\nrose again and flowed in torrents. In a frenzy of filial affection,\novercome by her mother's noble heroism, she fell on her knees before\nAdeline, took up the hem of her dress and kissed it, as pious Catholics\nkiss the holy relics of a martyr.\n\n\"Nay, get up, Hortense,\" said the Baroness. \"Such homage from my\ndaughter wipes out many sad memories. Come to my heart, and weep for no\nsorrows but your own. It is the despair of my dear little girl, whose\njoy was my only joy, that broke the solemn seal which nothing ought to\nhave removed from my lips. Indeed, I meant to have taken my woes to\nthe tomb, as a shroud the more. It was to soothe your anguish that I\nspoke.--God will forgive me!\n\n\"Oh! if my life were to be your life, what would I not do? Men, the\nworld, Fate, Nature, God Himself, I believe, make us pay for love\nwith the most cruel grief. I must pay for ten years of happiness and\ntwenty-four years of despair, of ceaseless sorrow, of bitterness--\"\n\n\"But you had ten years, dear mamma, and I have had but three!\" said the\nself-absorbed girl.\n\n\"Nothing is lost yet,\" said Adeline. \"Only wait till Wenceslas comes.\"\n\n\"Mother,\" said she, \"he lied, he deceived me. He said, 'I will not go,'\nand he went. And that over his child's cradle.\"\n\n\"For pleasure, my child, men will commit the most cowardly, the most\ninfamous actions--even crimes; it lies in their nature, it would seem.\nWe wives are set apart for sacrifice. I believed my troubles were ended,\nand they are beginning again, for I never thought to suffer doubly by\nsuffering with my child. Courage--and silence!--My Hortense, swear that\nyou will never discuss your griefs with anybody but me, never let them\nbe suspected by any third person. Oh! be as proud as your mother has\nbeen.\"\n\nHortense started; she had heard her husband's step.\n\n\"So it would seem,\" said Wenceslas, as he came in, \"that Stidmann has\nbeen here while I went to see him.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Hortense, with the angry irony of an offended woman who\nuses words to stab.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Wenceslas, affecting surprise. \"We have just met.\"\n\n\"And yesterday?\"\n\n\"Well, yesterday I deceived you, my darling love; and your mother shall\njudge between us.\"\n\nThis candor unlocked his wife's heart. All really lofty women like the\ntruth better than lies. They cannot bear to see their idol smirched;\nthey want to be proud of the despotism they bow to.\n\nThere is a strain of this feeling in the devotion of the Russians to\ntheir Czar.\n\n\"Now, listen, dear mother,\" Wenceslas went on. \"I so truly love my sweet\nand kind Hortense, that I concealed from her the extent of our poverty.\nWhat could I do? She was still nursing the boy, and such troubles would\nhave done her harm; you know what the risk is for a woman. Her beauty,\nyouth, and health are imperiled. Did I do wrong?--She believes that we\nowe five thousand francs; but I owe five thousand more. The day before\nyesterday we were in the depths! No one on earth will lend to us\nartists. Our talents are not less untrustworthy than our whims. I\nknocked in vain at every door. Lisbeth, indeed, offered us her savings.\"\n\n\"Poor soul!\" said Hortense.\n\n\"Poor soul!\" said the Baroness.\n\n\"But what are Lisbeth's two thousand francs? Everything to her, nothing\nto us.--Then, as you know, Hortense, she spoke to us of Madame Marneffe,\nwho, as she owes so much to the Baron, out of a sense of honor,\nwill take no interest. Hortense wanted to send her diamonds to the\nMont-de-Piete; they would have brought in a few thousand francs, but we\nneeded ten thousand. Those ten thousand francs were to be had free\nof interest for a year!--I said to myself, 'Hortense will be none the\nwiser; I will go and get them.'\n\n\"Then the woman asked me to dinner through my father-in-law, giving me\nto understand that Lisbeth had spoken of the matter, and I should have\nthe money. Between Hortense's despair on one hand, and the dinner on the\nother, I could not hesitate.--That is all.\n\n\"What! could Hortense, at four-and-twenty, lovely, pure, and virtuous,\nand all my pride and glory, imagine that, when I have never left her\nsince we married, I could now prefer--what?--a tawny, painted, ruddled\ncreature?\" said he, using the vulgar exaggeration of the studio to\nconvince his wife by the vehemence that women like.\n\n\"Oh! if only your father had ever spoken so----!\" cried the Baroness.\n\nHortense threw her arms round her husband's neck.\n\n\"Yes, that is what I should have done,\" said her mother. \"Wenceslas,\nmy dear fellow, your wife was near dying of it,\" she went on very\nseriously. \"You see how well she loves you. And, alas--she is yours!\"\n\nShe sighed deeply.\n\n\"He may make a martyr of her, or a happy woman,\" thought she to herself,\nas every mother thinks when she sees her daughter married.--\"It seems\nto me,\" she said aloud, \"that I am miserable enough to hope to see my\nchildren happy.\"\n\n\"Be quite easy, dear mamma,\" said Wenceslas, only too glad to see this\ncritical moment end happily. \"In two months I shall have repaid that\ndreadful woman. How could I help it,\" he went on, repeating this\nessentially Polish excuse with a Pole's grace; \"there are times when a\nman would borrow of the Devil.--And, after all, the money belongs to the\nfamily. When once she had invited me, should I have got the money at all\nif I had responded to her civility with a rude refusal?\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma, what mischief papa is bringing on us!\" cried Hortense.\n\nThe Baroness laid her finger on her daughter's lips, aggrieved by\nthis complaint, the first blame she had ever uttered of a father so\nheroically screened by her mother's magnanimous silence.\n\n\"Now, good-bye, my children,\" said Madame Hulot. \"The storm is over. But\ndo not quarrel any more.\"\n\nWhen Wenceslas and his wife returned to their room after letting out the\nBaroness, Hortense said to her husband:\n\n\"Tell me all about last evening.\"\n\nAnd she watched his face all through the narrative, interrupting him\nby the questions that crowd on a wife's mind in such circumstances.\nThe story made Hortense reflect; she had a glimpse of the infernal\ndissipation which an artist must find in such vicious company.\n\n\"Be honest, my Wenceslas; Stidmann was there, Claude Vignon,\nVernisset.--Who else? In short, it was good fun?\"\n\n\"I, I was thinking of nothing but our ten thousand francs, and I was\nsaying to myself, 'My Hortense will be freed from anxiety.'\"\n\nThis catechism bored the Livonian excessively; he seized a gayer moment\nto say:\n\n\"And you, my dearest, what would you have done if your artist had proved\nguilty?\"\n\n\"I,\" said she, with an air of prompt decision, \"I should have taken up\nStidmann--not that I love him, of course!\"\n\n\"Hortense!\" cried Steinbock, starting to his feet with a sudden and\ntheatrical emphasis. \"You would not have had the chance--I would have\nkilled you!\"\n\nHortense threw herself into his arms, clasping him closely enough to\nstifle him, and covered him with kisses, saying:\n\n\"Ah, you do love me! I fear nothing!--But no more Marneffe. Never go\nplunging into such horrible bogs.\"\n\n\"I swear to you, my dear Hortense, that I will go there no more,\nexcepting to redeem my note of hand.\"\n\nShe pouted at this, but only as a loving woman sulks to get something\nfor it. Wenceslas, tired out with such a morning's work, went off to his\nstudio to make a clay sketch of the _Samson and Delilah_, for which he\nhad the drawings in his pocket.\n\nHortense, penitent for her little temper, and fancying that her husband\nwas annoyed with her, went to the studio just as the sculptor had\nfinished handling the clay with the impetuosity that spurs an artist\nwhen the mood is on him. On seeing his wife, Wenceslas hastily threw the\nwet wrapper over the group, and putting both arms round her, he said:\n\n\"We were not really angry, were we, my pretty puss?\"\n\nHortense had caught sight of the group, had seen the linen thrown over\nit, and had said nothing; but as she was leaving, she took off the rag,\nlooked at the model, and asked:\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"A group for which I had just had an idea.\"\n\n\"And why did you hide it?\"\n\n\"I did not mean you to see it till it was finished.\"\n\n\"The woman is very pretty,\" said Hortense.\n\nAnd a thousand suspicions cropped up in her mind, as, in India, tall,\nrank plants spring up in a night-time.\n\n\n\nBy the end of three weeks, Madame Marneffe was intensely irritated by\nHortense. Women of that stamp have a pride of their own; they insist\nthat men shall kiss the devil's hoof; they have no forgiveness for the\nvirtue that does not quail before their dominion, or that even holds its\nown against them. Now, in all that time Wenceslas had not paid one visit\nin the Rue Vanneau, not even that which politeness required to a woman\nwho had sat for Delilah.\n\nWhenever Lisbeth called on the Steinbocks, there had been nobody at\nhome. Monsieur and madame lived in the studio. Lisbeth, following the\nturtle doves to their nest at le Gros-Caillou, found Wenceslas hard at\nwork, and was informed by the cook that madame never left monsieur's\nside. Wenceslas was a slave to the autocracy of love. So now Valerie, on\nher own account, took part with Lisbeth in her hatred of Hortense.\n\nWomen cling to a lover that another woman is fighting for, just as\nmuch as men do to women round whom many coxcombs are buzzing. Thus any\nreflections _a propos_ to Madame Marneffe are equally applicable to any\nlady-killing rake; he is, in fact, a sort of male courtesan. Valerie's\nlast fancy was a madness; above all, she was bent on getting her\ngroup; she was even thinking of going one morning to the studio to see\nWenceslas, when a serious incident arose of the kind which, to a woman\nof that class, may be called the spoil of war.\n\nThis is how Valerie announced this wholly personal event.\n\nShe was breakfasting with Lisbeth and her husband.\n\n\"I say, Marneffe, what would you say to being a second time a father?\"\n\n\"You don't mean it--a baby?--Oh, let me kiss you!\"\n\nHe rose and went round the table; his wife held up her head so that he\ncould just kiss her hair.\n\n\"If that is so,\" he went on, \"I am head-clerk and officer of the Legion\nof Honor at once. But you must understand, my dear, Stanislas is not to\nbe the sufferer, poor little man.\"\n\n\"Poor little man?\" Lisbeth put in. \"You have not set your eyes on him\nthese seven months. I am supposed to be his mother at the school; I am\nthe only person in the house who takes any trouble about him.\"\n\n\"A brat that costs us a hundred crowns a quarter!\" said Valerie. \"And\nhe, at any rate, is your own child, Marneffe. You ought to pay for his\nschooling out of your salary.--The newcomer, far from reminding us of\nbutcher's bills, will rescue us from want.\"\n\n\"Valerie,\" replied Marneffe, assuming an attitude like Crevel, \"I hope\nthat Monsieur le Baron Hulot will take proper charge of his son, and\nnot lay the burden on a poor clerk. I intend to keep him well up to the\nmark. So take the necessary steps, madame! Get him to write you letters\nin which he alludes to his satisfaction, for he is rather backward in\ncoming forward in regard to my appointment.\"\n\nAnd Marneffe went away to the office, where his chief's precious\nleniency allowed him to come in at about eleven o'clock. And, indeed,\nhe did little enough, for his incapacity was notorious, and he detested\nwork.\n\nNo sooner were they alone than Lisbeth and Valerie looked at each other\nfor a moment like Augurs, and both together burst into a loud fit of\nlaughter.\n\n\"I say, Valerie--is it the fact?\" said Lisbeth, \"or merely a farce?\"\n\n\"It is a physical fact!\" replied Valerie. \"Now, I am sick and tired\nof Hortense; and it occurred to me in the night that I might fire this\ninfant, like a bomb, into the Steinbock household.\"\n\nValerie went back to her room, followed by Lisbeth, to whom she showed\nthe following letter:--\n\n  \"WENCESLAS MY DEAR,--I still believe in your love, though it is\n  nearly three weeks since I saw you. Is this scorn? Delilah can\n  scarcely believe that. Does it not rather result from the tyranny\n  of a woman whom, as you told me, you can no longer love?\n  Wenceslas, you are too great an artist to submit to such dominion.\n  Home is the grave of glory.--Consider now, are you the Wenceslas\n  of the Rue du Doyenne? You missed fire with my father's statue;\n  but in you the lover is greater than the artist, and you have had\n  better luck with his daughter. You are a father, my beloved\n  Wenceslas.\n\n  \"If you do not come to me in the state I am in, your friends would\n  think very badly of you. But I love you so madly, that I feel I\n  should never have the strength to curse you. May I sign myself as\n  ever,\n\n  \"YOUR VALERIE.\"\n\n\n\"What do you say to my scheme for sending this note to the studio at a\ntime when our dear Hortense is there by herself?\" asked Valerie. \"Last\nevening I heard from Stidmann that Wenceslas is to pick him up at eleven\nthis morning to go on business to Chanor's; so that gawk Hortense will\nbe there alone.\"\n\n\"But after such a trick as that,\" replied Lisbeth, \"I cannot continue to\nbe your friend in the eyes of the world; I shall have to break with you,\nto be supposed never to visit you, or even to speak to you.\"\n\n\"Evidently,\" said Valerie; \"but--\"\n\n\"Oh! be quite easy,\" interrupted Lisbeth; \"we shall often meet when I am\nMadame la Marechale. They are all set upon it now. Only the Baron is in\nignorance of the plan, but you can talk him over.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Valerie, \"but it is quite likely that the Baron and I may\nbe on distant terms before long.\"\n\n\"Madame Olivier is the only person who can make Hortense demand to\nsee the letter,\" said Lisbeth. \"And you must send her to the Rue\nSaint-Dominique before she goes on to the studio.\"\n\n\"Our beauty will be at home, no doubt,\" said Valerie, ringing for Reine\nto call up Madame Olivier.\n\nTen minutes after the despatch of this fateful letter, Baron Hulot\narrived. Madame Marneffe threw her arms round the old man's neck with\nkittenish impetuosity.\n\n\"Hector, you are a father!\" she said in his ear. \"That is what comes of\nquarreling and making friends again----\"\n\nPerceiving a look of surprise, which the Baron did not at once conceal,\nValerie assumed a reserve which brought the old man to despair. She made\nhim wring the proofs from her one by one. When conviction, led on\nby vanity, had at last entered his mind, she enlarged on Monsieur\nMarneffe's wrath.\n\n\"My dear old veteran,\" said she, \"you can hardly avoid getting your\nresponsible editor, our representative partner if you like, appointed\nhead-clerk and officer of the Legion of Honor, for you really have done\nfor the poor man, he adores his Stanislas, the little monstrosity who is\nso like him, that to me he is insufferable. Unless you prefer to settle\ntwelve hundred francs a year on Stanislas--the capital to be his, and\nthe life-interest payable to me, of course--\"\n\n\"But if I am to settle securities, I would rather it should be on my own\nson, and not on the monstrosity,\" said the Baron.\n\nThis rash speech, in which the words \"my own son\" came out as full as\na river in flood, was, by the end of the hour, ratified as a formal\npromise to settle twelve hundred francs a year on the future boy. And\nthis promise became, on Valerie's tongue and in her countenance, what\na drum is in the hands of a child; for three weeks she played on it\nincessantly.\n\nAt the moment when Baron Hulot was leaving the Rue Vanneau, as happy\nas a man who after a year of married life still desires an heir,\nMadame Olivier had yielded to Hortense, and given up the note she was\ninstructed to give only into the Count's own hands. The young wife paid\ntwenty francs for that letter. The wretch who commits suicide must pay\nfor the opium, the pistol, the charcoal.\n\nHortense read and re-read the note; she saw nothing but this sheet of\nwhite paper streaked with black lines; the universe held for her\nnothing but that paper; everything was dark around her. The glare of the\nconflagration that was consuming the edifice of her happiness lighted\nup the page, for blackest night enfolded her. The shouts of her little\nWenceslas at play fell on her ear, as if he had been in the depths of a\nvalley and she on a high mountain. Thus insulted at four-and-twenty, in\nall the splendor of her beauty, enhanced by pure and devoted love--it\nwas not a stab, it was death. The first shock had been merely on the\nnerves, the physical frame had struggled in the grip of jealousy; but\nnow certainty had seized her soul, her body was unconscious.\n\nFor about ten minutes Hortense sat under the incubus of this oppression.\nThen a vision of her mother appeared before her, and revulsion ensued;\nshe was calm and cool, and mistress of her reason.\n\nShe rang.\n\n\"Get Louise to help you, child,\" said she to the cook. \"As quickly as\nyou can, pack up everything that belongs to me and everything wanted for\nthe little boy. I give you an hour. When all is ready, fetch a hackney\ncoach from the stand, and call me.\n\n\"Make no remarks! I am leaving the house, and shall take Louise with me.\nYou must stay here with monsieur; take good care of him----\"\n\nShe went into her room, and wrote the following letter:--\n\n  \"MONSIEUR LE COMTE,--\n\n  \"The letter I enclose will sufficiently account for the\n  determination I have come to.\n\n  \"When you read this, I shall have left your house and have found\n  refuge with my mother, taking our child with me.\n\n  \"Do not imagine that I shall retrace my steps. Do not imagine that\n  I am acting with the rash haste of youth, without reflection, with\n  the anger of offended affection; you will be greatly mistaken.\n\n  \"I have been thinking very deeply during the last fortnight of\n  life, of love, of our marriage, of our duties to each other. I\n  have known the perfect devotion of my mother; she has told me all\n  her sorrows! She has been heroical--every day for twenty-three\n  years. But I have not the strength to imitate her, not because I\n  love you less than she loves my father, but for reasons of spirit\n  and nature. Our home would be a hell; I might lose my head so far\n  as to disgrace you--disgrace myself and our child.\n\n  \"I refuse to be a Madame Marneffe; once launched on such a course,\n  a woman of my temper might not, perhaps, be able to stop. I am,\n  unfortunately for myself, a Hulot, not a Fischer.\n\n  \"Alone, and absent from the scene of your dissipations, I am sure\n  of myself, especially with my child to occupy me, and by the side\n  of a strong and noble mother, whose life cannot fail to influence\n  the vehement impetuousness of my feelings. There, I can be a good\n  mother, bring our boy up well, and live. Under your roof the wife\n  would oust the mother; and constant contention would sour my\n  temper.\n\n  \"I can accept a death-blow, but I will not endure for\n  twenty-five years, like my mother. If, at the end of three years of\n  perfect, unwavering love, you can be unfaithful to me with your\n  father-in-law's mistress, what rivals may I expect to have in later\n  years? Indeed, monsieur, you have begun your career of profligacy\n  much earlier than my father did, the life of dissipation, which is\n  a disgrace to the father of a family, which undermines the respect\n  of his children, and which ends in shame and despair.\n\n  \"I am not unforgiving. Unrelenting feelings do not beseem erring\n  creatures living under the eye of God. If you win fame and fortune\n  by sustained work, if you have nothing to do with courtesans and\n  ignoble, defiling ways, you will find me still a wife worthy of\n  you.\n\n  \"I believe you to be too much a gentleman, Monsieur le Comte, to\n  have recourse to the law. You will respect my wishes, and leave me\n  under my mother's roof. Above all, never let me see you there. I\n  have left all the money lent to you by that odious woman.--\n  Farewell.\n\n  \"HORTENSE HULOT.\"\n\n\nThis letter was written in anguish. Hortense abandoned herself to the\ntears, the outcries of murdered love. She laid down her pen and took\nit up again, to express as simply as possible all that passion commonly\nproclaims in this sort of testamentary letter. Her heart went forth in\nexclamations, wailing and weeping; but reason dictated the words.\n\nInformed by Louise that all was ready, the young wife slowly went round\nthe little garden, through the bedroom and drawing-room, looking at\neverything for the last time. Then she earnestly enjoined the cook to\ntake the greatest care for her master's comfort, promising to reward\nher handsomely if she would be honest. At last she got into the hackney\ncoach to drive to her mother's house, her heart quite broken, crying so\nmuch as to distress the maid, and covering little Wenceslas with kisses,\nwhich betrayed her still unfailing love for his father.\n\nThe Baroness knew already from Lisbeth that the father-in-law was\nlargely to blame for the son-in-law's fault; nor was she surprised to\nsee her daughter, whose conduct she approved, and she consented to give\nher shelter. Adeline, perceiving that her own gentleness and patience\nhad never checked Hector, for whom her respect was indeed fast\ndiminishing, thought her daughter very right to adopt another course.\n\nIn three weeks the poor mother had suffered two wounds of which the pain\nwas greater than any ill-fortune she had hitherto endured. The Baron\nhad placed Victorin and his wife in great difficulties; and then, by\nLisbeth's account, he was the cause of his son-in-law's misconduct, and\nhad corrupted Wenceslas. The dignity of the father of the family, so\nlong upheld by her really foolish self-sacrifice, was now overthrown.\nThough they did not regret the money the young Hulots were full alike of\ndoubts and uneasiness as regarded the Baron. This sentiment, which was\nevidence enough, distressed the Baroness; she foresaw a break-up of the\nfamily tie.\n\nHortense was accommodated in the dining-room, arranged as a bedroom\nwith the help of the Marshal's money, and the anteroom became the\ndining-room, as it is in many apartments.\n\n\n\nWhen Wenceslas returned home and had read the two letters, he felt\na kind of gladness mingled with regret. Kept so constantly under his\nwife's eye, so to speak, he had inwardly rebelled against this fresh\nthraldom, _a la_ Lisbeth. Full fed with love for three years past, he\ntoo had been reflecting during the last fortnight; and he found a family\nheavy on his hands. He had just been congratulated by Stidmann on the\npassion he had inspired in Valerie; for Stidmann, with an under-thought\nthat was not unnatural, saw that he might flatter the husband's vanity\nin the hope of consoling the victim. And Wenceslas was glad to be able\nto return to Madame Marneffe.\n\nStill, he remembered the pure and unsullied happiness he had known,\nthe perfections of his wife, her judgment, her innocent and guileless\naffection,--and he regretted her acutely. He thought of going at once to\nhis mother-in-law's to crave forgiveness; but, in fact, like Hulot and\nCrevel, he went to Madame Marneffe, to whom he carried his wife's\nletter to show her what a disaster she had caused, and to discount\nhis misfortune, so to speak, by claiming in return the pleasures his\nmistress could give him.\n\nHe found Crevel with Valerie. The mayor, puffed up with pride, marched\nup and down the room, agitated by a storm of feelings. He put himself\ninto position as if he were about to speak, but he dared not. His\ncountenance was beaming, and he went now and again to the window, where\nhe drummed on the pane with his fingers. He kept looking at Valerie with\na glance of tender pathos. Happily for him, Lisbeth presently came in.\n\n\"Cousin Betty,\" he said in her ear, \"have you heard the news? I am a\nfather! It seems to me I love my poor Celestine the less.--Oh! what\na thing it is to have a child by the woman one idolizes! It is the\nfatherhood of the heart added to that of the flesh! I say--tell Valerie\nthat I will work for that child--it shall be rich. She tells me she has\nsome reason for believing that it will be a boy! If it is a boy, I shall\ninsist on his being called Crevel. I will consult my notary about it.\"\n\n\"I know how much she loves you,\" said Lisbeth. \"But for her sake in the\nfuture, and for your own, control yourself. Do not rub your hands every\nfive minutes.\"\n\nWhile Lisbeth was speaking aside on this wise to Crevel, Valerie had\nasked Wenceslas to give her back her letter, and she was saying things\nthat dispelled all his griefs.\n\n\"So now you are free, my dear,\" said she. \"Ought any great artist to\nmarry? You live only by fancy and freedom! There, I shall love you so\nmuch, beloved poet, that you shall never regret your wife. At the\nsame time, if, like so many people, you want to keep up appearances, I\nundertake to bring Hortense back to you in a very short time.\"\n\n\"Oh, if only that were possible!\"\n\n\"I am certain of it,\" said Valerie, nettled. \"Your poor father-in-law\nis a man who is in every way utterly done for; who wants to appear as\nthough he could be loved, out of conceit, and to make the world believe\nthat he has a mistress; and he is so excessively vain on this point,\nthat I can do what I please with him. The Baroness is still so\ndevoted to her old Hector--I always feel as if I were talking of the\n_Iliad_--that these two old folks will contrive to patch up matters\nbetween you and Hortense. Only, if you want to avoid storms at home for\nthe future, do not leave me for three weeks without coming to see your\nmistress--I was dying of it. My dear boy, some consideration is due from\na gentleman to a woman he has so deeply compromised, especially when, as\nin my case, she has to be very careful of her reputation.\n\n\"Stay to dinner, my darling--and remember that I must treat you with all\nthe more apparent coldness because you are guilty of this too obvious\nmishap.\"\n\nBaron Montes was presently announced; Valerie rose and hurried forward\nto meet him; she spoke a few sentences in his ear, enjoining on him the\nsame reserve as she had impressed on Wenceslas; the Brazilian assumed\na diplomatic reticence suitable to the great news which filled him with\ndelight, for he, at any rate was sure of his paternity.\n\nThanks to these tactics, based on the vanity of the man in the lover\nstage of his existence, Valerie sat down to table with four men, all\npleased and eager to please, all charmed, and each believing himself\nadored; called by Marneffe, who included himself, in speaking to\nLisbeth, the five Fathers of the Church.\n\nBaron Hulot alone at first showed an anxious countenance, and this was\nwhy. Just as he was leaving the office, the head of the staff of clerks\nhad come to his private room--a General with whom he had served for\nthirty years--and Hulot had spoken to him as to appointing Marneffe to\nCoquet's place, Coquet having consented to retire.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said he, \"I would not ask this favor of the Prince\nwithout our having agreed on the matter, and knowing that you approved.\"\n\n\"My good friend,\" replied the other, \"you must allow me to observe that,\nfor your own sake, you should not insist on this nomination. I have\nalready told you my opinion. There would be a scandal in the office,\nwhere there is a great deal too much talk already about you and Madame\nMarneffe. This, of course, is between ourselves. I have no wish to touch\nyou on a sensitive spot, or disoblige you in any way, and I will prove\nit. If you are determined to get Monsieur Coquet's place, and he will\nreally be a loss in the War Office, for he has been here since 1809, I\nwill go into the country for a fortnight, so as to leave the field open\nbetween you and the Marshal, who loves you as a son. Then I shall\ntake neither part, and shall have nothing on my conscience as an\nadministrator.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" said Hulot. \"I will reflect on what you have\nsaid.\"\n\n\"In allowing myself to say so much, my dear friend, it is because your\npersonal interest is far more deeply implicated than any concern or\nvanity of mine. In the first place, the matter lies entirely with the\nMarshal. And then, my good fellow, we are blamed for so many things,\nthat one more or less! We are not at the maiden stage in our experience\nof fault-finding. Under the Restoration, men were put in simply to give\nthem places, without any regard for the office.--We are old friends----\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the Baron put in; \"and it is in order not to impair our old and\nvalued friendship that I--\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said the departmental manager, seeing Hulot's face clouded\nwith embarrassment, \"I will take myself off, old fellow.--But I warn\nyou! you have enemies--that is to say, men who covet your splendid\nappointment, and you have but one anchor out. Now if, like me, you were\na Deputy, you would have nothing to fear; so mind what you are about.\"\n\nThis speech, in the most friendly spirit, made a deep impression on the\nCouncillor of State.\n\n\"But, after all, Roger, what is it that is wrong? Do not make any\nmysteries with me.\"\n\nThe individual addressed as Roger looked at Hulot, took his hand, and\npressed it.\n\n\"We are such old friends, that I am bound to give you warning. If you\nwant to keep your place, you must make a bed for yourself, and instead\nof asking the Marshal to give Coquet's place to Marneffe, in your place\nI would beg him to use his influence to reserve a seat for me on the\nGeneral Council of State; there you may die in peace, and, like the\nbeaver, abandon all else to the pursuers.\"\n\n\"What, do you think the Marshal would forget--\"\n\n\"The Marshal has already taken your part so warmly at a General Meeting\nof the Ministers, that you will not now be turned out; but it was\nseriously discussed! So give them no excuse. I can say no more. At this\nmoment you may make your own terms; you may sit on the Council of State\nand be made a Peer of the Chamber. If you delay too long, if you give\nany one a hold against you, I can answer for nothing.--Now, am I to go?\"\n\n\"Wait a little. I will see the Marshal,\" replied Hulot, \"and I will send\nmy brother to see which way the wind blows at headquarters.\"\n\nThe humor in which the Baron came back to Madame Marneffe's may be\nimagined; he had almost forgotten his fatherhood, for Roger had taken\nthe part of a true and kind friend in explaining the position. At\nthe same time Valerie's influence was so great that, by the middle\nof dinner, the Baron was tuned up to the pitch, and was all the more\ncheerful for having unwonted anxieties to conceal; but the hapless\nman was not yet aware that in the course of that evening he would find\nhimself in a cleft stick, between his happiness and the danger pointed\nout by his friend--compelled, in short, to choose between Madame\nMarneffe and his official position.\n\nAt eleven o'clock, when the evening was at its gayest, for the room was\nfull of company, Valerie drew Hector into a corner of her sofa.\n\n\"My dear old boy,\" said she, \"your daughter is so annoyed at knowing\nthat Wenceslas comes here, that she has left him 'planted.' Hortense is\nwrong-headed. Ask Wenceslas to show you the letter the little fool has\nwritten to him.\n\n\"This division of two lovers, of which I am reputed to be the cause, may\ndo me the greatest harm, for this is how virtuous women undermine each\nother. It is disgraceful to pose as a victim in order to cast the blame\non a woman whose only crime is that she keeps a pleasant house. If\nyou love me, you will clear my character by reconciling the sweet\nturtle-doves.\n\n\"I do not in the least care about your son-in-law's visits; you brought\nhim here--take him away again! If you have any authority in your family,\nit seems to me that you may very well insist on your wife's patching up\nthis squabble. Tell the worthy old lady from me, that if I am unjustly\ncharged with having caused a young couple to quarrel, with upsetting the\nunity of a family, and annexing both the father and the son-in-law, I\nwill deserve my reputation by annoying them in my own way! Why, here is\nLisbeth talking of throwing me over! She prefers to stick to her family,\nand I cannot blame her for it. She will throw me over, says she, unless\nthe young people make friends again. A pretty state of things! Our\nexpenses here will be trebled!\"\n\n\"Oh, as for that!\" said the Baron, on hearing of his daughter's strong\nmeasures, \"I will have no nonsense of that kind.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Valerie. \"And now for the next thing.--What about\nCoquet's place?\"\n\n\"That,\" said Hector, looking away, \"is more difficult, not to say\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"Impossible, my dear Hector?\" said Madame Marneffe in the Baron's ear.\n\"But you do not know to what lengths Marneffe will go. I am completely\nin his power; he is immoral for his own gratification, like most men,\nbut he is excessively vindictive, like all weak and impotent natures. In\nthe position to which you have reduced me, I am in his power. I am\nbound to be on terms with him for a few days, and he is quite capable of\nrefusing to leave my room any more.\"\n\nHulot started with horror.\n\n\"He would leave me alone on condition of being head-clerk. It is\nabominable--but logical.\"\n\n\"Valerie, do you love me?\"\n\n\"In the state in which I am, my dear, the question is the meanest\ninsult.\"\n\n\"Well, then--if I were to attempt, merely to attempt, to ask the Prince\nfor a place for Marneffe, I should be done for, and Marneffe would be\nturned out.\"\n\n\"I thought that you and the Prince were such intimate friends.\"\n\n\"We are, and he has amply proved it; but, my child, there is authority\nabove the Marshal's--for instance, the whole Council of Ministers. With\ntime and a little tacking, we shall get there. But, to succeed, I must\nwait till the moment when some service is required of me. Then I can say\none good turn deserves another--\"\n\n\"If I tell Marneffe this tale, my poor Hector, he will play us some\nmean trick. You must tell him yourself that he has to wait. I will not\nundertake to do so. Oh! I know what my fate would be. He knows how to\npunish me! He will henceforth share my room----\n\n\"Do not forget to settle the twelve hundred francs a year on the little\none!\"\n\nHulot, seeing his pleasures in danger, took Monsieur Marneffe aside, and\nfor the first time derogated from the haughty tone he had always\nassumed towards him, so greatly was he horrified by the thought of that\nhalf-dead creature in his pretty young wife's bedroom.\n\n\"Marneffe, my dear fellow,\" said he, \"I have been talking of you to-day.\nBut you cannot be promoted to the first class just yet. We must have\ntime.\"\n\n\"I will be, Monsieur le Baron,\" said Marneffe shortly.\n\n\"But, my dear fellow--\"\n\n\"I _will_ be, Monsieur le Baron,\" Marneffe coldly repeated, looking\nalternately at the Baron and at Valerie. \"You have placed my wife in a\nposition that necessitates her making up her differences with me, and I\nmean to keep her; for, _my dear fellow_, she is a charming creature,\" he\nadded, with crushing irony. \"I am master here--more than you are at the\nWar Office.\"\n\nThe Baron felt one of those pangs of fury which have the effect, in the\nheart, of a fit of raging toothache, and he could hardly conceal the\ntears in his eyes.\n\nDuring this little scene, Valerie had been explaining Marneffe's\nimaginary determination to Montes, and thus had rid herself of him for a\ntime.\n\nOf her four adherents, Crevel alone was exempted from the rule--Crevel,\nthe master of the little \"bijou\" apartment; and he displayed on his\ncountenance an air of really insolent beatitude, notwithstanding\nthe wordless reproofs administered by Valerie in frowns and meaning\ngrimaces. His triumphant paternity beamed in every feature.\n\nWhen Valerie was whispering a word of correction in his ear, he snatched\nher hand, and put in:\n\n\"To-morrow, my Duchess, you shall have your own little house! The papers\nare to be signed to-morrow.\"\n\n\"And the furniture?\" said she, with a smile.\n\n\"I have a thousand shares in the Versailles _rive gauche_ railway. I\nbought them at twenty-five, and they will go up to three hundred in\nconsequence of the amalgamation of the two lines, which is a secret told\nto me. You shall have furniture fit for a queen. But then you will be\nmine alone henceforth?\"\n\n\"Yes, burly Maire,\" said this middle-class Madame de Merteuil. \"But\nbehave yourself; respect the future Madame Crevel.\"\n\n\"My dear cousin,\" Lisbeth was saying to the Baron, \"I shall go to\nsee Adeline early to-morrow; for, as you must see, I cannot, with any\ndecency, remain here. I will go and keep house for your brother the\nMarshal.\"\n\n\"I am going home this evening,\" said Hulot.\n\n\"Very well, you will see me at breakfast to-morrow,\" said Lisbeth,\nsmiling.\n\nShe understood that her presence would be necessary at the family scene\nthat would take place on the morrow. And the very first thing in the\nmorning she went to see Victorin and to tell him that Hortense and\nWenceslas had parted.\n\nWhen the Baron went home at half-past ten, Mariette and Louise, who had\nhad a hard day, were locking up the apartment. Hulot had not to ring.\n\nVery much put out at this compulsory virtue, the husband went straight\nto his wife's room, and through the half-open door he saw her kneeling\nbefore her Crucifix, absorbed in prayer, in one of those attitudes\nwhich make the fortune of the painter or the sculptor who is so happy\nto invent and then to express them. Adeline, carried away by her\nenthusiasm, was praying aloud:\n\n\"O God, have mercy and enlighten him!\"\n\nThe Baroness was praying for her Hector.\n\nAt this sight, so unlike what he had just left, and on hearing this\npetition founded on the events of the day, the Baron heaved a sigh of\ndeep emotion. Adeline looked round, her face drowned in tears. She was\nso convinced that her prayer had been heard, that, with one spring, she\nthrew her arms round Hector with the impetuosity of happy affection.\nAdeline had given up all a wife's instincts; sorrow had effaced even the\nmemory of them. No feeling survived in her but those of motherhood,\nof the family honor, and the pure attachment of a Christian wife for a\nhusband who has gone astray--the saintly tenderness which survives all\nelse in a woman's soul.\n\n\"Hector!\" she said, \"are you come back to us? Has God taken pity on our\nfamily?\"\n\n\"Dear Adeline,\" replied the Baron, coming in and seating his wife by his\nside on a couch, \"you are the saintliest creature I ever knew; I have\nlong known myself to be unworthy of you.\"\n\n\"You would have very little to do, my dear,\" said she, holding Hulot's\nhand and trembling so violently that it was as though she had a palsy,\n\"very little to set things in order--\"\n\nShe dared not proceed; she felt that every word would be a reproof,\nand she did not wish to mar the happiness with which this meeting was\ninundating her soul.\n\n\"It is Hortense who has brought me here,\" said Hulot. \"That child may\ndo us far more harm by her hasty proceeding than my absurd passion for\nValerie has ever done. But we will discuss all this to-morrow morning.\nHortense is asleep, Mariette tells me; we will not disturb her.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Madame Hulot, suddenly plunged into the depths of grief.\n\nShe understood that the Baron's return was prompted not so much by the\nwish to see his family as by some ulterior interest.\n\n\"Leave her in peace till to-morrow,\" said the mother. \"The poor child is\nin a deplorable condition; she has been crying all day.\"\n\n\n\nAt nine the next morning, the Baron, awaiting his daughter, whom he had\nsent for, was pacing the large, deserted drawing-room, trying to find\narguments by which to conquer the most difficult form of obstinacy\nthere is to deal with--that of a young wife, offended and implacable, as\nblameless youth ever is, in its ignorance of the disgraceful compromises\nof the world, of its passions and interests.\n\n\"Here I am, papa,\" said Hortense in a tremulous voice, and looking pale\nfrom her miseries.\n\nHulot, sitting down, took his daughter round the waist, and drew her\ndown to sit on his knee.\n\n\"Well, my child,\" said he, kissing her forehead, \"so there are troubles\nat home, and you have been hasty and headstrong? That is not like a\nwell-bred child. My Hortense ought not to have taken such a decisive\nstep as that of leaving her house and deserting her husband on her own\naccount, and without consulting her parents. If my darling girl had come\nto see her kind and admirable mother, she would not have given me\nthis cruel pain I feel!--You do not know the world; it is malignantly\nspiteful. People will perhaps say that your husband sent you back to\nyour parents. Children brought up as you were, on your mother's\nlap, remain artless; maidenly passion like yours for Wenceslas,\nunfortunately, makes no allowances; it acts on every impulse. The little\nheart is moved, the head follows suit. You would burn down Paris to be\nrevenged, with no thought of the courts of justice!\n\n\"When your old father tells you that you have outraged the proprieties,\nyou may take his word for it.--I say nothing of the cruel pain you have\ngiven me. It is bitter, I assure you, for you throw all the blame on a\nwoman of whose heart you know nothing, and whose hostility may become\ndisastrous. And you, alas! so full of guileless innocence and purity,\ncan have no suspicions; but you may be vilified and slandered.--Besides,\nmy darling pet, you have taken a foolish jest too seriously. I can\nassure you, on my honor, that your husband is blameless. Madame\nMarneffe--\"\n\nSo far the Baron, artistically diplomatic, had formulated his\nremonstrances very judiciously. He had, as may be observed, worked up to\nthe mention of this name with superior skill; and yet Hortense, as she\nheard it, winced as if stung to the quick.\n\n\"Listen to me; I have had great experience, and I have seen much,\" he\nwent on, stopping his daughter's attempt to speak. \"That lady is very\ncold to your husband. Yes, you have been made the victim of a practical\njoke, and I will prove it to you. Yesterday Wenceslas was dining with\nher--\"\n\n\"Dining with her!\" cried the young wife, starting to her feet, and\nlooking at her father with horror in every feature. \"Yesterday! After\nhaving had my letter! Oh, great God!--Why did I not take the veil rather\nthan marry? But now my life is not my own! I have the child!\" and she\nsobbed.\n\nHer weeping went to Madame Hulot's heart. She came out of her room\nand ran to her daughter, taking her in her arms, and asking her those\nquestions, stupid with grief, which first rose to her lips.\n\n\"Now we have tears,\" said the Baron to himself, \"and all was going so\nwell! What is to be done with women who cry?\"\n\n\"My child,\" said the Baroness, \"listen to your father! He loves us\nall--come, come--\"\n\n\"Come, Hortense, my dear little girl, cry no more, you make yourself too\nugly!\" said the Baron, \"Now, be a little reasonable. Go sensibly home,\nand I promise you that Wenceslas shall never set foot in that woman's\nhouse. I ask you to make the sacrifice, if it is a sacrifice to forgive\nthe husband you love so small a fault. I ask you--for the sake of my\ngray hairs, and of the love you owe your mother. You do not want to\nblight my later years with bitterness and regret?\"\n\nHortense fell at her father's feet like a crazed thing, with the\nvehemence of despair; her hair, loosely pinned up, fell about her, and\nshe held out her hands with an expression that painted her misery.\n\n\"Father,\" she said, \"ask my life! Take it if you will, but at least take\nit pure and spotless, and I will yield it up gladly. Do not ask me to\ndie in dishonor and crime. I am not at all like my husband; I cannot\nswallow an outrage. If I went back under my husband's roof, I should be\ncapable of smothering him in a fit of jealousy--or of doing worse! Do no\nexact from me a thing that is beyond my powers. Do not have to mourn for\nme still living, for the least that can befall me is to go mad. I feel\nmadness close upon me!\n\n\"Yesterday, yesterday, he could dine with that woman, after having read\nmy letter?--Are other men made so? My life I give you, but do not let my\ndeath be ignominious!--His fault?--A small one! When he has a child by\nthat woman!\"\n\n\"A child!\" cried Hulot, starting back a step or two. \"Come. This is\nreally some fooling.\"\n\nAt this juncture Victorin and Lisbeth arrived, and stood dumfounded\nat the scene. The daughter was prostrate at her father's feet. The\nBaroness, speechless between her maternal feelings and her conjugal\nduty, showed a harassed face bathed in tears.\n\n\"Lisbeth,\" said the Baron, seizing his cousin by the hand and pointing\nto Hortense, \"you can help me here. My poor child's brain is turned; she\nbelieves that her Wenceslas is Madame Marneffe's lover, while all that\nValerie wanted was to have a group by him.\"\n\n\"_Delilah_!\" cried the young wife. \"The only thing he has done since\nour marriage. The man would not work for me or for his son, and he has\nworked with frenzy for that good-for-nothing creature.--Oh, father, kill\nme outright, for every word stabs like a knife!\"\n\nLisbeth turned to the Baroness and Victorin, pointing with a pitying\nshrug to the Baron, who could not see her.\n\n\"Listen to me,\" said she to him. \"I had no idea--when you asked me to go\nto lodge over Madame Marneffe and keep house for her--I had no idea\nof what she was; but many things may be learned in three years. That\ncreature is a prostitute, and one whose depravity can only be compared\nwith that of her infamous and horrible husband. You are the dupe, my\nlord pot-boiler, of those people; you will be led further by them than\nyou dream of! I speak plainly, for you are at the bottom of a pit.\"\n\nThe Baroness and her daughter, hearing Lisbeth speak in this style, cast\nadoring looks at her, such as the devout cast at a Madonna for having\nsaved their life.\n\n\"That horrible woman was bent on destroying your son-in-law's home.\nTo what end?--I know not. My brain is not equal to seeing clearly into\nthese dark intrigues--perverse, ignoble, infamous! Your Madame Marneffe\ndoes not love your son-in-law, but she will have him at her feet out of\nrevenge. I have just spoken to the wretched woman as she deserves. She\nis a shameless courtesan; I have told her that I am leaving her house,\nthat I would not have my honor smirched in that muck-heap.--I owe myself\nto my family before all else.\n\n\"I knew that Hortense had left her husband, so here I am. Your\nValerie, whom you believe to be a saint, is the cause of this miserable\nseparation; can I remain with such a woman? Our poor little Hortense,\"\nsaid she, touching the Baron's arm, with peculiar meaning, \"is perhaps\nthe dupe of a wish of such women as these, who, to possess a toy, would\nsacrifice a family.\n\n\"I do not think Wenceslas guilty; but I think him weak, and I cannot\npromise that he will not yield to her refinements of temptation.--My\nmind is made up. The woman is fatal to you; she will bring you all to\nutter ruin. I will not even seem to be concerned in the destruction of\nmy own family, after living there for three years solely to hinder it.\n\n\"You are cheated, Baron; say very positively that you will have nothing\nto say to the promotion of that dreadful Marneffe, and you will see\nthen! There is a fine rod in pickle for you in that case.\"\n\nLisbeth lifted up Hortense and kissed her enthusiastically.\n\n\"My dear Hortense, stand firm,\" she whispered.\n\nThe Baroness embraced Lisbeth with the vehemence of a woman who sees\nherself avenged. The whole family stood in perfect silence round the\nfather, who had wit enough to know what that silence implied. A storm\nof fury swept across his brow and face with evident signs; the veins\nswelled, his eyes were bloodshot, his flesh showed patches of color.\nAdeline fell on her knees before him and seized his hands.\n\n\"My dear, forgive, my dear!\"\n\n\"You loathe me!\" cried the Baron--the cry of his conscience.\n\nFor we all know the secret of our own wrong-doing. We almost always\nascribe to our victims the hateful feelings which must fill them with\nthe hope of revenge; and in spite of every effort of hypocrisy, our\ntongue or our face makes confession under the rack of some unexpected\nanguish, as the criminal of old confessed under the hands of the\ntorturer.\n\n\"Our children,\" he went on, to retract the avowal, \"turn at last to be\nour enemies--\"\n\n\"Father!\" Victorin began.\n\n\"You dare to interrupt your father!\" said the Baron in a voice of\nthunder, glaring at his son.\n\n\"Father, listen to me,\" Victorin went on in a clear, firm voice, the\nvoice of a puritanical deputy. \"I know the respect I owe you too well\never to fail in it, and you will always find me the most respectful and\nsubmissive of sons.\"\n\nThose who are in the habit of attending the sittings of the Chamber\nwill recognize the tactics of parliamentary warfare in these fine-drawn\nphrases, used to calm the factions while gaining time.\n\n\"We are far from being your enemies,\" his son went on. \"I have quarreled\nwith my father-in-law, Monsieur Crevel, for having rescued your notes of\nhand for sixty thousand francs from Vauvinet, and that money is, beyond\ndoubt, in Madame Marneffe's pocket.--I am not finding fault with you,\nfather,\" said he, in reply to an impatient gesture of the Baron's; \"I\nsimply wish to add my protest to my cousin Lisbeth's, and to point\nout to you that though my devotion to you as a father is blind and\nunlimited, my dear father, our pecuniary resources, unfortunately, are\nvery limited.\"\n\n\"Money!\" cried the excitable old man, dropping on to a chair, quite\ncrushed by this argument. \"From my son!--You shall be repaid your money,\nsir,\" said he, rising, and he went to the door.\n\n\"Hector!\"\n\nAt this cry the Baron turned round, suddenly showing his wife a face\nbathed in tears; she threw her arms round him with the strength of\ndespair.\n\n\"Do not leave us thus--do not go away in anger. I have not said a\nword--not I!\"\n\nAt this heart-wrung speech the children fell at their father's feet.\n\n\"We all love you,\" said Hortense.\n\nLisbeth, as rigid as a statue, watched the group with a superior smile\non her lips. Just then Marshal Hulot's voice was heard in the anteroom.\nThe family all felt the importance of secrecy, and the scene suddenly\nchanged. The young people rose, and every one tried to hide all traces\nof emotion.\n\nA discussion was going on at the door between Mariette and a soldier,\nwho was so persistent that the cook came in.\n\n\"Monsieur, a regimental quartermaster, who says he is just come from\nAlgiers, insists on seeing you.\"\n\n\"Tell him to wait.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Mariette to her master in an undertone, \"he told me to\ntell you privately that it has to do with your uncle there.\"\n\nThe Baron started; he believed that the funds had been sent at last\nwhich he had been asking for these two months, to pay up his bills; he\nleft the family-party, and hurried out to the anteroom.\n\n\"You are Monsieur de Paron Hulot?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Your own self?\"\n\n\"My own self.\"\n\nThe man, who had been fumbling meanwhile in the lining of his cap, drew\nout a letter, of which the Baron hastily broke the seal, and read as\nfollows:--\n\n  \"DEAR NEPHEW,--Far from being able to send you the hundred\n  thousand francs you ask of me, my present position is not tenable\n  unless you can take some decisive steps to save me. We are saddled\n  with a public prosecutor who talks goody, and rhodomontades\n  nonsense about the management. It is impossible to get the\n  black-chokered pump to hold his tongue. If the War Minister allows\n  civilians to feed out of his hand, I am done for. I can trust the\n  bearer; try to get him promoted; he has done us good service. Do\n  not abandon me to the crows!\"\n\nThis letter was a thunderbolt; the Baron could read in it the intestine\nwarfare between civil and military authorities, which to this day\nhampers the Government, and he was required to invent on the spot some\npalliative for the difficulty that stared him in the face. He desired\nthe soldier to come back next day, dismissing him with splendid promises\nof promotion, and he returned to the drawing-room. \"Good-day\nand good-bye, brother,\" said he to the Marshal.--\"Good-bye,\nchildren.--Good-bye, my dear Adeline.--And what are you going to do,\nLisbeth?\" he asked.\n\n\"I?--I am going to keep house for the Marshal, for I must end my days\ndoing what I can for one or another of you.\"\n\n\"Do not leave Valerie till I have seen you again,\" said Hulot in his\ncousin's ear.--\"Good-bye, Hortense, refractory little puss; try to be\nreasonable. I have important business to be attended to at once; we will\ndiscuss your reconciliation another time. Now, think it over, my child,\"\nsaid he as he kissed her.\n\nAnd he went away, so evidently uneasy, that his wife and children felt\nthe gravest apprehensions.\n\n\"Lisbeth,\" said the Baroness, \"I must find out what is wrong with\nHector; I never saw him in such a state. Stay a day or two longer with\nthat woman; he tells her everything, and we can then learn what has so\nsuddenly upset him. Be quite easy; we will arrange your marriage to the\nMarshal, for it is really necessary.\"\n\n\"I shall never forget the courage you have shown this morning,\" said\nHortense, embracing Lisbeth.\n\n\"You have avenged our poor mother,\" said Victorin.\n\nThe Marshal looked on with curiosity at all the display of affection\nlavished on Lisbeth, who went off to report the scene to Valerie.\n\nThis sketch will enable guileless souls to understand what various\nmischief Madame Marneffes may do in a family, and the means by which\nthey reach poor virtuous wives apparently so far out of their ken. And\nthen, if we only transfer, in fancy, such doings to the upper class of\nsociety about a throne, and if we consider what kings' mistresses must\nhave cost them, we may estimate the debt owed by a nation to a sovereign\nwho sets the example of a decent and domestic life.\n\n\n\nIn Paris each ministry is a little town by itself, whence women are\nbanished; but there is just as much detraction and scandal as though\nthe feminine population were admitted there. At the end of three years,\nMonsieur Marneffe's position was perfectly clear and open to the day,\nand in every room one and another asked, \"Is Marneffe to be, or not to\nbe, Coquet's successor?\" Exactly as the question might have been put\nto the Chamber, \"Will the estimates pass or not pass?\" The smallest\ninitiative on the part of the board of Management was commented on;\neverything in Baron Hulot's department was carefully noted. The astute\nState Councillor had enlisted on his side the victim of Marneffe's\npromotion, a hard-working clerk, telling him that if he could fill\nMarneffe's place, he would certainly succeed to it; he had told him\nthat the man was dying. So this clerk was scheming for Marneffe's\nadvancement.\n\nWhen Hulot went through his anteroom, full of visitors, he saw\nMarneffe's colorless face in a corner, and sent for him before any one\nelse.\n\n\"What do you want of me, my dear fellow?\" said the Baron, disguising his\nanxiety.\n\n\"Monsieur le Directeur, I am the laughing-stock of the office, for it\nhas become known that the chief of the clerks has left this morning for\na holiday, on the ground of his health. He is to be away a month. Now,\nwe all know what waiting for a month means. You deliver me over to the\nmockery of my enemies, and it is bad enough to be drummed upon one side;\ndrumming on both at once, monsieur, is apt to burst the drum.\"\n\n\"My dear Marneffe, it takes long patience to gain an end. You cannot be\nmade head-clerk in less than two months, if ever. Just when I must, as\nfar as possible, secure my own position, is not the time to be applying\nfor your promotion, which would raise a scandal.\"\n\n\"If you are broke, I shall never get it,\" said Marneffe coolly. \"And if\nyou get me the place, it will make no difference in the end.\"\n\n\"Then I am to sacrifice myself for you?\" said the Baron.\n\n\"If you do not, I shall be much mistaken in you.\"\n\n\"You are too exclusively Marneffe, Monsieur Marneffe,\" said Hulot,\nrising and showing the clerk the door.\n\n\"I have the honor to wish you good-morning, Monsieur le Baron,\" said\nMarneffe humbly.\n\n\"What an infamous rascal!\" thought the Baron. \"This is uncommonly like a\nsummons to pay within twenty-four hours on pain of distraint.\"\n\nTwo hours later, just when the Baron had been instructing Claude Vignon,\nwhom he was sending to the Ministry of Justice to obtain information\nas to the judicial authorities under whose jurisdiction Johann Fischer\nmight fall, Reine opened the door of his private room and gave him a\nnote, saying she would wait for the answer.\n\n\"Valerie is mad!\" said the Baron to himself. \"To send Reine! It is\nenough to compromise us all, and it certainly compromises that dreadful\nMarneffe's chances of promotion!\"\n\nBut he dismissed the minister's private secretary, and read as\nfollows:--\n\n  \"Oh, my dear friend, what a scene I have had to endure! Though you\n  have made me happy for three years, I have paid dearly for it! He\n  came in from the office in a rage that made me quake. I knew he\n  was ugly; I have seen him a monster! His four real teeth\n  chattered, and he threatened me with his odious presence without\n  respite if I should continue to receive you. My poor, dear old\n  boy, our door is closed against you henceforth. You see my tears;\n  they are dropping on the paper and soaking it; can you read what I\n  write, dear Hector? Oh, to think of never seeing you, of giving\n  you up when I bear in me some of your life, as I flatter myself I\n  have your heart--it is enough to kill me. Think of our little\n  Hector!\n\n  \"Do not forsake me, but do not disgrace yourself for Marneffe's\n  sake; do not yield to his threats.\n\n  \"I love you as I have never loved! I remember all the sacrifices\n  you have made for your Valerie; she is not, and never will be,\n  ungrateful; you are, and will ever be, my only husband. Think no\n  more of the twelve hundred francs a year I asked you to settle on\n  the dear little Hector who is to come some months hence; I will\n  not cost you anything more. And besides, my money will always be\n  yours.\n\n  \"Oh, if you only loved me as I love you, my Hector, you would\n  retire on your pension; we should both take leave of our family,\n  our worries, our surroundings, so full of hatred, and we should go\n  to live with Lisbeth in some pretty country place--in Brittany, or\n  wherever you like. There we should see nobody, and we should be\n  happy away from the world. Your pension and the little property I\n  can call my own would be enough for us. You say you are jealous;\n  well, you would then have your Valerie entirely devoted to her\n  Hector, and you would never have to talk in a loud voice, as you\n  did the other day. I shall have but one child--ours--you may be\n  sure, my dearly loved old veteran.\n\n  \"You cannot conceive of my fury, for you cannot know how he\n  treated me, and the foul words he vomited on your Valerie. Such\n  words would disgrace my paper; a woman such as I am--Montcornet's\n  daughter--ought never to have heard one of them in her life. I\n  only wish you had been there, that I might have punished him with\n  the sight of the mad passion I felt for you. My father would have\n  killed the wretch; I can only do as women do--love you devotedly!\n  Indeed, my love, in the state of exasperation in which I am, I\n  cannot possibly give up seeing you. I must positively see you, in\n  secret, every day! That is what we are, we women. Your resentment\n  is mine. If you love me, I implore you, do not let him be\n  promoted; leave him to die a second-class clerk.\n\n  \"At this moment I have lost my head; I still seem to hear him\n  abusing me. Betty, who had meant to leave me, has pity on me, and\n  will stay for a few days.\n\n  \"My dear kind love, I do not know yet what is to be done. I see\n  nothing for it but flight. I always delight in the country\n  --Brittany, Languedoc, what you will, so long as I am free to love\n  you. Poor dear, how I pity you! Forced now to go back to your old\n  Adeline, to that lachrymal urn--for, as he no doubt told you, the\n  monster means to watch me night and day; he spoke of a detective!\n  Do not come here, he is capable of anything I know, since he could\n  make use of me for the basest purposes of speculation. I only wish\n  I could return you all the things I have received from your\n  generosity.\n\n  \"Ah! my kind Hector, I may have flirted, and have seemed to you to\n  be fickle, but you did not know your Valerie; she liked to tease\n  you, but she loves you better than any one in the world.\n\n  \"He cannot prevent your coming to see your cousin; I will arrange\n  with her that we have speech with each other. My dear old boy,\n  write me just a line, pray, to comfort me in the absence of your\n  dear self. (Oh, I would give one of my hands to have you by me on\n  our sofa!) A letter will work like a charm; write me something\n  full of your noble soul; I will return your note to you, for I\n  must be cautious; I should not know where to hide it, he pokes his\n  nose in everywhere. In short, comfort your Valerie, your little\n  wife, the mother of your child.--To think of my having to write to\n  you, when I used to see you every day. As I say to Lisbeth, 'I did\n  not know how happy I was.' A thousand kisses, dear boy. Be true to\n  your\n\n\"VALERIE.\"\n\n\n\"And tears!\" said Hulot to himself as he finished this letter, \"tears\nwhich have blotted out her name.--How is she?\" said he to Reine.\n\n\"Madame is in bed; she has dreadful spasms,\" replied Reine. \"She had a\nfit of hysterics that twisted her like a withy round a faggot. It came\non after writing. It comes of crying so much. She heard monsieur's voice\non the stairs.\"\n\nThe Baron in his distress wrote the following note on office paper with\na printed heading:--\n\n  \"Be quite easy, my angel, he will die a second-class clerk!--Your\n  idea is admirable; we will go and live far from Paris, where we\n  shall be happy with our little Hector; I will retire on my\n  pension, and I shall be sure to find some good appointment on a\n  railway.\n\n  \"Ah, my sweet friend, I feel so much the younger for your letter!\n  I shall begin life again and make a fortune, you will see, for our\n  dear little one. As I read your letter, a thousand times more\n  ardent than those of the _Nouvelle Heloise_, it worked a miracle!\n  I had not believed it possible that I could love you more. This\n  evening, at Lisbeth's you will see\n\n\"YOUR HECTOR, FOR LIFE.\"\n\n\nReine carried off this reply, the first letter the Baron had written\nto his \"sweet friend.\" Such emotions to some extent counterbalanced\nthe disasters growling in the distance; but the Baron, at this moment\nbelieving he could certainly avert the blows aimed at his uncle, Johann\nFischer, thought only of the deficit.\n\nOne of the characteristics of the Bonapartist temperament is a firm\nbelief in the power of the sword, and confidence in the superiority\nof the military over civilians. Hulot laughed to scorn the Public\nProsecutor in Algiers, where the War Office is supreme. Man is always\nwhat he has once been. How can the officers of the Imperial Guard forget\nthat time was when the mayors of the largest towns in the Empire and the\nEmperor's prefects, Emperors themselves on a minute scale, would come\nout to meet the Imperial Guard, to pay their respects on the borders\nof the Departments through which it passed, and to do it, in short, the\nhomage due to sovereigns?\n\nAt half-past four the baron went straight to Madame Marneffe's; his\nheart beat as high as a young man's as he went upstairs, for he was\nasking himself this question, \"Shall I see her? or shall I not?\"\n\nHow was he now to remember the scene of the morning when his weeping\nchildren had knelt at his feet? Valerie's note, enshrined for ever in a\nthin pocket-book over his heart, proved to him that she loved him more\nthan the most charming of young men.\n\nHaving rung, the unhappy visitor heard within the shuffling slippers and\nvexatious scraping cough of the detestable master. Marneffe opened the\ndoor, but only to put himself into an attitude and point to the stairs,\nexactly as Hulot had shown him the door of his private room.\n\n\"You are too exclusively Hulot, Monsieur Hulot!\" said he.\n\nThe Baron tried to pass him, Marneffe took a pistol out of his pocket\nand cocked it.\n\n\"Monsieur le Baron,\" said he, \"when a man is as vile as I am--for you\nthink me very vile, don't you?--he would be the meanest galley-slave if\nhe did not get the full benefit of his betrayed honor.--You are for\nwar; it will be hot work and no quarter. Come here no more, and do not\nattempt to get past me. I have given the police notice of my position\nwith regard to you.\"\n\nAnd taking advantage of Hulot's amazement, he pushed him out and shut\nthe door.\n\n\"What a low scoundrel!\" said Hulot to himself, as he went upstairs to\nLisbeth. \"I understand her letter now. Valerie and I will go away from\nParis. Valerie is wholly mine for the remainder of my days; she will\nclose my eyes.\"\n\nLisbeth was out. Madame Olivier told the Baron that she had gone to his\nwife's house, thinking that she would find him there.\n\n\"Poor thing! I should never have expected her to be so sharp as she was\nthis morning,\" thought Hulot, recalling Lisbeth's behavior as he made\nhis way from the Rue Vanneau to the Rue Plumet.\n\nAs he turned the corner of the Rue Vanneau and the Rue de Babylone, he\nlooked back at the Eden whence Hymen had expelled him with the sword\nof the law. Valerie, at her window, was watching his departure; as he\nglanced up, she waved her handkerchief, but the rascally Marneffe hit\nhis wife's cap and dragged her violently away from the window. A tear\nrose to the great official's eye.\n\n\"Oh! to be so well loved! To see a woman so ill used, and to be so\nnearly seventy years old!\" thought he.\n\nLisbeth had come to give the family the good news. Adeline and Hortense\nhad already heard that the Baron, not choosing to compromise himself in\nthe eyes of the whole office by appointing Marneffe to the first class,\nwould be turned from the door by the Hulot-hating husband. Adeline, very\nhappy, had ordered a dinner that her Hector was to like better than\nany of Valerie's; and Lisbeth, in her devotion, was helping Mariette to\nachieve this difficult result. Cousin Betty was the idol of the hour.\nMother and daughter kissed her hands, and had told her with touching\ndelight that the Marshal consented to have her as his housekeeper.\n\n\"And from that, my dear, there is but one step to becoming his wife!\"\nsaid Adeline.\n\n\"In fact, he did not say no when Victorin mentioned it,\" added the\nCountess.\n\nThe Baron was welcomed home with such charming proofs of affection,\nso pathetically overflowing with love, that he was fain to conceal his\ntroubles.\n\nMarshal Hulot came to dinner. After dinner, Hector did not go out.\nVictorin and his wife joined them, and they made up a rubber.\n\n\"It is a long time, Hector,\" said the Marshal gravely, \"since you gave\nus the treat of such an evening.\"\n\nThis speech from the old soldier, who spoiled his brother though he thus\nimplicitly blamed him, made a deep impression. It showed how wide and\ndeep were the wounds in a heart where all the woes he had divined had\nfound an echo. At eight o'clock the Baron insisted on seeing Lisbeth\nhome, promising to return.\n\n\"Do you know, Lisbeth, he ill-treats her!\" said he in the street. \"Oh, I\nnever loved her so well!\"\n\n\"I never imagined that Valerie loved you so well,\" replied Lisbeth. \"She\nis frivolous and a coquette, she loves to have attentions paid her, and\nto have the comedy of love-making performed for her, as she says; but\nyou are her only real attachment.\"\n\n\"What message did she send me?\"\n\n\"Why, this,\" said Lisbeth. \"She has, as you know, been on intimate terms\nwith Crevel. You must owe her no grudge, for that, in fact, is what has\nraised her above utter poverty for the rest of her life; but she detests\nhim, and matters are nearly at an end.--Well, she has kept the key of\nsome rooms--\"\n\n\"Rue du Dauphin!\" cried the thrice-blest Baron. \"If it were for that\nalone, I would overlook Crevel.--I have been there; I know.\"\n\n\"Here, then, is the key,\" said Lisbeth. \"Have another made from it in\nthe course of to-morrow--two if you can.\"\n\n\"And then,\" said Hulot eagerly.\n\n\"Well, I will dine at your house again to-morrow; you must give me back\nValerie's key, for old Crevel might ask her to return it to him, and you\ncan meet her there the day after; then you can decide what your facts\nare to be. You will be quite safe, as there are two ways out. If by\nchance Crevel, who is _Regence_ in his habits, as he is fond of saying,\nshould come in by the side street, you could go out through the shop, or\n_vice versa_.\n\n\"You owe all this to me, you old villain; now what will you do for me?\"\n\n\"Whatever you want.\"\n\n\"Then you will not oppose my marrying your brother?\"\n\n\"You! the Marechale Hulot, the Comtesse de Frozheim?\" cried Hector,\nstartled.\n\n\"Well, Adeline is a Baroness!\" retorted Betty in a vicious and\nformidable tone. \"Listen to me, you old libertine. You know how matters\nstand; your family may find itself starving in the gutter--\"\n\n\"That is what I dread,\" said Hulot in dismay.\n\n\"And if your brother were to die, who would maintain your wife and\ndaughter? The widow of a Marshal gets at least six thousand francs\npension, doesn't she? Well, then, I wish to marry to secure bread for\nyour wife and daughter--old dotard!\"\n\n\"I had not seen it in that light!\" said the Baron. \"I will talk to my\nbrother--for we are sure of you.--Tell my angel that my life is hers.\"\n\nAnd the Baron, having seen Lisbeth go into the house in the Rue Vanneau,\nwent back to his whist and stayed at home. The Baroness was at the\nheight of happiness; her husband seemed to be returning to domestic\nhabits; for about a fortnight he went to his office at nine every\nmorning, he came in to dinner at six, and spent the evening with his\nfamily. He twice took Adeline and Hortense to the play. The mother and\ndaughter paid for three thanksgiving masses, and prayed to God to suffer\nthem to keep the husband and father He had restored to them.\n\nOne evening Victorin Hulot, seeing his father retire for the night, said\nto his mother:\n\n\"Well, we are at any rate so far happy that my father has come back to\nus. My wife and I shall never regret our capital if only this lasts--\"\n\n\"Your father is nearly seventy,\" said the Baroness. \"He still thinks\nof Madame Marneffe, that I can see; but he will forget her in time.\nA passion for women is not like gambling, or speculation, or avarice;\nthere is an end to it.\"\n\nBut Adeline, still beautiful in spite of her fifty years and her\nsorrows, in this was mistaken. Profligates, men whom Nature has gifted\nwith the precious power of loving beyond the limits ordinarily set to\nlove, rarely are as old as their age.\n\n\n\nDuring this relapse into virtue Baron Hulot had been three times to\nthe Rue du Dauphin, and had certainly not been the man of seventy. His\nrekindled passion made him young again, and he would have sacrificed his\nhonor to Valerie, his family, his all, without a regret. But Valerie,\nnow completely altered, never mentioned money, not even the twelve\nhundred francs a year to be settled on their son; on the contrary, she\noffered him money, she loved Hulot as a woman of six-and-thirty loves a\nhandsome law-student--a poor, poetical, ardent boy. And the hapless wife\nfancied she had reconquered her dear Hector!\n\nThe fourth meeting between this couple had been agreed upon at the\nend of the third, exactly as formerly in Italian theatres the play was\nannounced for the next night. The hour fixed was nine in the morning.\nOn the next day when the happiness was due for which the amorous old man\nhad resigned himself to domestic rules, at about eight in the morning,\nReine came and asked to see the Baron. Hulot, fearing some catastrophe,\nwent out to speak with Reine, who would not come into the anteroom. The\nfaithful waiting-maid gave him the following note:--\n\n  \"DEAR OLD MAN,--Do not go to the Rue du Dauphin. Our incubus is\n  ill, and I must nurse him; but be there this evening at nine.\n  Crevel is at Corbeil with Monsieur Lebas; so I am sure he will\n  bring no princess to his little palace. I have made arrangements\n  here to be free for the night and get back before Marneffe is\n  awake. Answer me as to all this, for perhaps your long elegy of a\n  wife no longer allows you your liberty as she did. I am told she\n  is still so handsome that you might play me false, you are such a\n  gay dog! Burn this note; I am suspicious of every one.\"\n\nHulot wrote this scrap in reply:\n\n  \"MY LOVE,--As I have told you, my wife has not for five-and-twenty\n  years interfered with my pleasures. For you I would give up a\n  hundred Adelines.--I will be in the Crevel sanctum at nine this\n  evening awaiting my divinity. Oh that your clerk might soon die!\n  We should part no more. And this is the dearest wish of\n\n\"YOUR HECTOR.\"\n\n\nThat evening the Baron told his wife that he had business with the\nMinister at Saint-Cloud, that he would come home at about four or five\nin the morning; and he went to the Rue du Dauphin. It was towards the\nend of the month of June.\n\nFew men have in the course of their life known really the dreadful\nsensation of going to their death; those who have returned from the\nfoot of the scaffold may be easily counted. But some have had a vivid\nexperience of it in dreams; they have gone through it all, to the\nsensation of the knife at their throat, at the moment when waking\nand daylight come to release them.--Well, the sensation to which the\nCouncillor of State was a victim at five in the morning in Crevel's\nhandsome and elegant bed, was immeasurably worse than that of feeling\nhimself bound to the fatal block in the presence of ten thousand\nspectators looking at you with twenty thousand sparks of fire.\n\nValerie was asleep in a graceful attitude. She was lovely, as a woman\nis who is lovely enough to look so even in sleep. It is art invading\nnature; in short, a living picture.\n\nIn his horizontal position the Baron's eyes were but three feet above\nthe floor. His gaze, wandering idly, as that of a man who is just awake\nand collecting his ideas, fell on a door painted with flowers by Jan, an\nartist disdainful of fame. The Baron did not indeed see twenty thousand\nflaming eyes, like the man condemned to death; he saw but one, of which\nthe shaft was really more piercing than the thousands on the Public\nSquare.\n\nNow this sensation, far rarer in the midst of enjoyment even than\nthat of a man condemned to death, was one for which many a splenetic\nEnglishman would certainly pay a high price. The Baron lay there,\nhorizontal still, and literally bathed in cold sweat. He tried to doubt\nthe fact; but this murderous eye had a voice. A sound of whispering was\nheard through the door.\n\n\"So long as it is nobody but Crevel playing a trick on me!\" said the\nBaron to himself, only too certain of an intruder in the temple.\n\nThe door was opened. The Majesty of the French Law, which in all\ndocuments follows next to the King, became visible in the person of a\nworthy little police-officer supported by a tall Justice of the Peace,\nboth shown in by Monsieur Marneffe. The police functionary, rooted in\nshoes of which the straps were tied together with flapping bows, ended\nat top in a yellow skull almost bare of hair, and a face betraying him\nas a wide-awake, cheerful, and cunning dog, from whom Paris life had no\nsecrets. His eyes, though garnished with spectacles, pierced the\nglasses with a keen mocking glance. The Justice of the Peace, a retired\nattorney, and an old admirer of the fair sex, envied the delinquent.\n\n\"Pray excuse the strong measures required by our office, Monsieur\nle Baron!\" said the constable; \"we are acting for the plaintiff.\nThe Justice of the Peace is here to authorize the visitation of the\npremises.--I know who you are, and who the lady is who is accused.\"\n\nValerie opened her astonished eyes, gave such a shriek as actresses use\nto depict madness on the stage, writhed in convulsions on the bed, like\na witch of the Middle Ages in her sulphur-colored frock on a bed of\nfaggots.\n\n\"Death, and I am ready! my dear Hector--but a police court?--Oh! never.\"\n\nWith one bound she passed the three spectators and crouched under the\nlittle writing-table, hiding her face in her hands.\n\n\"Ruin! Death!\" she cried.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Marneffe to Hulot, \"if Madame Marneffe goes mad, you\nare worse than a profligate; you will be a murderer.\"\n\nWhat can a man do, what can he say, when he is discovered in a bed which\nis not his, even on the score of hiring, with a woman who is no more his\nthan the bed is?--Well, this:\n\n\"Monsieur the Justice of the Peace, Monsieur the Police Officer,\" said\nthe Baron with some dignity, \"be good enough to take proper care of\nthat unhappy woman, whose reason seems to me to be in danger.--You can\nharangue me afterwards. The doors are locked, no doubt; you need not\nfear that she will get away, or I either, seeing the costume we wear.\"\n\nThe two functionaries bowed to the magnate's injunctions.\n\n\"You, come here, miserable cur!\" said Hulot in a low voice to Marneffe,\ntaking him by the arm and drawing him closer. \"It is not I, but you, who\nwill be the murderer! You want to be head-clerk of your room and officer\nof the Legion of Honor?\"\n\n\"That in the first place, Chief!\" replied Marneffe, with a bow.\n\n\"You shall be all that, only soothe your wife and dismiss these\nfellows.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay!\" said Marneffe knowingly. \"These gentlemen must draw up their\nreport as eyewitnesses to the fact; without that, the chief evidence in\nmy case, where should I be? The higher official ranks are chokeful of\nrascalities. You have done me out of my wife, and you have not promoted\nme, Monsieur le Baron; I give you only two days to get out of the\nscrape. Here are some letters--\"\n\n\"Some letters!\" interrupted Hulot.\n\n\"Yes; letters which prove that you are the father of the child my wife\nexpects to give birth to.--You understand? And you ought to settle on my\nson a sum equal to what he will lose through this bastard. But I will\nbe reasonable; this does not distress me, I have no mania for paternity\nmyself. A hundred louis a year will satisfy me. By to-morrow I must be\nMonsieur Coquet's successor and see my name on the list for promotion in\nthe Legion of Honor at the July fetes, or else--the documentary evidence\nand my charge against you will be laid before the Bench. I am not so\nhard to deal with after all, you see.\"\n\n\"Bless me, and such a pretty woman!\" said the Justice of the Peace to\nthe police constable. \"What a loss to the world if she should go mad!\"\n\n\"She is not mad,\" said the constable sententiously. The police is always\nthe incarnation of scepticism.--\"Monsieur le Baron Hulot has been caught\nby a trick,\" he added, loud enough for Valerie to hear him.\n\nValerie shot a flash from her eye which would have killed him on\nthe spot if looks could effect the vengeance they express. The\npolice-officer smiled; he had laid a snare, and the woman had fallen\ninto it. Marneffe desired his wife to go into the other room and clothe\nherself decently, for he and the Baron had come to an agreement on all\npoints, and Hulot fetched his dressing-gown and came out again.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he to the two officials, \"I need not impress on you to\nbe secret.\"\n\nThe functionaries bowed.\n\nThe police-officer rapped twice on the door; his clerk came in, sat down\nat the \"bonheur-du-jour,\" and wrote what the constable dictated to him\nin an undertone. Valerie still wept vehemently. When she was dressed,\nHulot went into the other room and put on his clothes. Meanwhile the\nreport was written.\n\nMarneffe then wanted to take his wife home; but Hulot, believing that\nhe saw her for the last time, begged the favor of being allowed to speak\nwith her.\n\n\"Monsieur, your wife has cost me dear enough for me to be allowed to say\ngood-bye to her--in the presence of you all, of course.\"\n\nValerie went up to Hulot, and he whispered in her ear:\n\n\"There is nothing left for us but to fly, but how can we correspond? We\nhave been betrayed--\"\n\n\"Through Reine,\" she answered. \"But my dear friend, after this scandal\nwe can never meet again. I am disgraced. Besides, you will hear dreadful\nthings about me--you will believe them--\"\n\nThe Baron made a gesture of denial.\n\n\"You will believe them, and I can thank God for that, for then perhaps\nyou will not regret me.\"\n\n\"He will _not_ die a second-class clerk!\" said Marneffe to Hulot, as\nhe led his wife away, saying roughly, \"Come, madame; if I am foolish to\nyou, I do not choose to be a fool to others.\"\n\nValerie left the house, Crevel's Eden, with a last glance at the Baron,\nso cunning that he thought she adored him. The Justice of the Peace\ngave Madame Marneffe his arm to the hackney coach with a flourish of\ngallantry. The Baron, who was required to witness the report, remained\nquite bewildered, alone with the police-officer. When the Baron had\nsigned, the officer looked at him keenly, over his glasses.\n\n\"You are very sweet on the little lady, Monsieur le Baron?\"\n\n\"To my sorrow, as you see.\"\n\n\"Suppose that she does not care for you?\" the man went on, \"that she is\ndeceiving you?\"\n\n\"I have long known that, monsieur--here, in this very spot, Monsieur\nCrevel and I told each other----\"\n\n\"Oh! Then you knew that you were in Monsieur le Maire's private\nsnuggery?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\nThe constable lightly touched his hat with a respectful gesture.\n\n\"You are very much in love,\" said he. \"I say no more. I respect an\ninveterate passion, as a doctor respects an inveterate complaint.--I saw\nMonsieur de Nucingen, the banker, attacked in the same way--\"\n\n\"He is a friend of mine,\" said the Baron. \"Many a time have I supped\nwith his handsome Esther. She was worth the two million francs she cost\nhim.\"\n\n\"And more,\" said the officer. \"That caprice of the old Baron's cost four\npersons their lives. Oh! such passions as these are like the cholera!\"\n\n\"What had you to say to me?\" asked the Baron, who took this indirect\nwarning very ill.\n\n\"Oh! why should I deprive you of your illusions?\" replied the officer.\n\"Men rarely have any left at your age!\"\n\n\"Rid me of them!\" cried the Councillor.\n\n\"You will curse the physician later,\" replied the officer, smiling.\n\n\"I beg of you, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Well, then, that woman was in collusion with her husband.\"\n\n\"Oh!----\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, and so it is in two cases out of every ten. Oh! we know it\nwell.\"\n\n\"What proof have you of such a conspiracy?\"\n\n\"In the first place, the husband!\" said the other, with the calm acumen\nof a surgeon practised in unbinding wounds. \"Mean speculation is stamped\nin every line of that villainous face. But you, no doubt, set great\nstore by a certain letter written by that woman with regard to the\nchild?\"\n\n\"So much so, that I always have it about me,\" replied Hulot, feeling in\nhis breast-pocket for the little pocketbook which he always kept there.\n\n\"Leave your pocketbook where it is,\" said the man, as crushing as a\nthunder-clap. \"Here is the letter.--I now know all I want to know.\nMadame Marneffe, of course, was aware of what that pocketbook\ncontained?\"\n\n\"She alone in the world.\"\n\n\"So I supposed.--Now for the proof you asked for of her collusion with\nher husband.\"\n\n\"Let us hear!\" said the Baron, still incredulous.\n\n\"When we came in here, Monsieur le Baron, that wretched creature\nMarneffe led the way, and he took up this letter, which his wife,\nno doubt, had placed on this writing-table,\" and he pointed to the\n_bonheur-du-jour_. \"That evidently was the spot agreed upon by the\ncouple, in case she should succeed in stealing the letter while you were\nasleep; for this letter, as written to you by the lady, is, combined\nwith those you wrote to her, decisive evidence in a police-court.\"\n\nHe showed Hulot the note that Reine had delivered to him in his private\nroom at the office.\n\n\"It is one of the documents in the case,\" said the police-agent; \"return\nit to me, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Well, monsieur,\" replied Hulot with bitter expression, \"that woman is\nprofligacy itself in fixed ratios. I am certain at this moment that she\nhas three lovers.\"\n\n\"That is perfectly evident,\" said the officer. \"Oh, they are not all\non the streets! When a woman follows that trade in a carriage and\na drawing-room, and her own house, it is not a case for francs and\ncentimes, Monsieur le Baron. Mademoiselle Esther, of whom you spoke,\nand who poisoned herself, made away with millions.--If you will take\nmy advice, you will get out of it, monsieur. This last little game will\nhave cost you dear. That scoundrel of a husband has the law on his side.\nAnd indeed, but for me, that little woman would have caught you again!\"\n\n\"Thank you, monsieur,\" said the Baron, trying to maintain his dignity.\n\n\"Now we will lock up; the farce is played out, and you can send your key\nto Monsieur the Mayor.\"\n\nHulot went home in a state of dejection bordering on helplessness, and\nsunk in the gloomiest thoughts. He woke his noble and saintly wife, and\npoured into her heart the history of the past three years, sobbing like\na child deprived of a toy. This confession from an old man young in\nfeeling, this frightful and heart-rending narrative, while it filled\nAdeline with pity, also gave her the greatest joy; she thanked Heaven\nfor this last catastrophe, for in fancy she saw the husband settled at\nlast in the bosom of his family.\n\n\"Lisbeth was right,\" said Madame Hulot gently and without any useless\nrecrimination, \"she told us how it would be.\"\n\n\"Yes. If only I had listened to her, instead of flying into a rage, that\nday when I wanted poor Hortense to go home rather than compromise the\nreputation of that--Oh! my dear Adeline, we must save Wenceslas. He is\nup to his chin in that mire!\"\n\n\"My poor old man, the respectable middle-classes have turned out no\nbetter than the actresses,\" said Adeline, with a smile.\n\nThe Baroness was alarmed at the change in her Hector; when she saw him\nso unhappy, ailing, crushed under his weight of woes, she was all heart,\nall pity, all love; she would have shed her blood to make Hulot happy.\n\n\"Stay with us, my dear Hector. Tell me what is it that such women do to\nattract you so powerfully. I too will try. Why have you not taught me\nto be what you want? Am I deficient in intelligence? Men still think me\nhandsome enough to court my favor.\"\n\nMany a married woman, attached to her duty and to her husband, may here\npause to ask herself why strong and affectionate men, so tender-hearted\nto the Madame Marneffes, do not take their wives for the object of their\nfancies and passions, especially wives like the Baronne Adeline Hulot.\n\nThis is, indeed, one of the most recondite mysteries of human nature.\nLove, which is debauch of reason, the strong and austere joy of a lofty\nsoul, and pleasure, the vulgar counterfeit sold in the market-place,\nare two aspects of the same thing. The woman who can satisfy both these\ndevouring appetites is as rare in her sex as a great general, a great\nwriter, a great artist, a great inventor in a nation. A man of superior\nintellect or an idiot--a Hulot or a Crevel--equally crave for the ideal\nand for enjoyment; all alike go in search of the mysterious compound, so\nrare that at last it is usually found to be a work in two volumes. This\ncraving is a depraved impulse due to society.\n\nMarriage, no doubt, must be accepted as a tie; it is life, with its\nduties and its stern sacrifices on both parts equally. Libertines, who\nseek for hidden treasure, are as guilty as other evil-doers who are more\nhardly dealt with than they. These reflections are not a mere veneer of\nmoralizing; they show the reason of many unexplained misfortunes. But,\nindeed, this drama points its own moral--or morals, for they are of many\nkinds.\n\nThe Baron presently went to call on the Marshal Prince de Wissembourg,\nwhose powerful patronage was now his only chance. Having dwelt under his\nprotection for five-and-thirty years, he was a visitor at all hours, and\nwould be admitted to his rooms as soon as he was up.\n\n\"Ah! How are you, my dear Hector?\" said the great and worthy leader.\n\"What is the matter? You look anxious. And yet the session is ended.\nOne more over! I speak of that now as I used to speak of a campaign.\nAnd indeed I believe the newspapers nowadays speak of the sessions as\nparliamentary campaigns.\"\n\n\"We have been in difficulties, I must confess, Marshal; but the times\nare hard!\" said Hulot. \"It cannot be helped; the world was made so.\nEvery phase has its own drawbacks. The worst misfortunes in the year\n1841 is that neither the King nor the ministers are free to act as\nNapoleon was.\"\n\nThe Marshal gave Hulot one of those eagle flashes which in its pride,\nclearness, and perspicacity showed that, in spite of years, that lofty\nsoul was still upright and vigorous.\n\n\"You want me to so something for you?\" said he, in a hearty tone.\n\n\"I find myself under the necessity of applying to you for the promotion\nof one of my second clerks to the head of a room--as a personal favor to\nmyself--and his advancement to be officer of the Legion of Honor.\"\n\n\"What is his name?\" said the Marshal, with a look like a lightning\nflash.\n\n\"Marneffe.\"\n\n\"He has a pretty wife; I saw her on the occasion of your daughter's\nmarriage.--If Roger--but Roger is away!--Hector, my boy, this is\nconcerned with your pleasures. What, you still indulge--? Well, you\nare a credit to the old Guard. That is what comes of having been in\nthe Commissariat; you have reserves!--But have nothing to do with this\nlittle job, my dear boy; it is too strong of the petticoat to be good\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"No, Marshal; it is bad business, for the police courts have a finger in\nit. Would you like to see me go there?\"\n\n\"The devil!\" said the Prince uneasily. \"Go on!\"\n\n\"Well, I am in the predicament of a trapped fox. You have always been so\nkind to me, that you will, I am sure, condescend to help me out of the\nshameful position in which I am placed.\"\n\nHulot related his misadventures, as wittily and as lightly as he could.\n\n\"And you, Prince, will you allow my brother to die of grief, a man you\nlove so well; or leave one of your staff in the War Office, a Councillor\nof State, to live in disgrace. This Marneffe is a wretched creature; he\ncan be shelved in two or three years.\"\n\n\"How you talk of two or three years, my dear fellow!\" said the Marshal.\n\n\"But, Prince, the Imperial Guard is immortal.\"\n\n\"I am the last of the first batch of Marshals,\" said the Prince.\n\"Listen, Hector. You do not know the extent of my attachment to you; you\nshall see. On the day when I retire from office, we will go together.\nBut you are not a Deputy, my friend. Many men want your place; but\nfor me, you would be out of it by this time. Yes, I have fought many a\npitched battle to keep you in it.--Well, I grant you your two requests;\nit would be too bad to see you riding the bar at your age and in the\nposition you hold. But you stretch your credit a little too far. If this\nappointment gives rise to discussion, we shall not be held blameless. I\ncan laugh at such things; but you will find it a thorn under your feet.\nAnd the next session will see your dismissal. Your place is held out as\na bait to five or six influential men, and you have been enabled to keep\nit solely by the force of my arguments. I tell you, on the day when you\nretire, there will be five malcontents to one happy man; whereas, by\nkeeping you hanging on by a thread for two or three years, we shall\nsecure all six votes. There was a great laugh at the Council meeting;\nthe Veteran of the Old Guard, as they say, was becoming desperately\nwide awake in parliamentary tactics! I am frank with you.--And you\nare growing gray; you are a happy man to be able to get into such\ndifficulties as these! How long is it since I--Lieutenant Cottin--had a\nmistress?\"\n\nHe rang the bell.\n\n\"That police report must be destroyed,\" he added.\n\n\"Monseigneur, you are as a father to me! I dared not mention my anxiety\non that point.\"\n\n\"I still wish I had Roger here,\" cried the Prince, as Mitouflet, his\ngroom of the chambers, came in. \"I was just going to send for him!--You\nmay go, Mitouflet.--Go you, my dear old fellow, go and have the\nnomination made out; I will sign it. At the same time, that low schemer\nwill not long enjoy the fruit of his crimes. He will be sharply watched,\nand drummed out of the regiment for the smallest fault.--You are saved\nthis time, my dear Hector; take care for the future. Do not exhaust your\nfriends' patience. You shall have the nomination this morning, and your\nman shall get his promotion in the Legion of Honor.--How old are you\nnow?\"\n\n\"Within three months of seventy.\"\n\n\"What a scapegrace!\" said the Prince, laughing. \"It is you who deserve a\npromotion, but, by thunder! we are not under Louis XV.!\"\n\nSuch is the sense of comradeship that binds the glorious survivors of\nthe Napoleonic phalanx, that they always feel as if they were in camp\ntogether, and bound to stand together through thick and thin.\n\n\"One more favor such as this,\" Hulot reflected as he crossed the\ncourtyard, \"and I am done for!\"\n\nThe luckless official went to Baron de Nucingen, to whom he now owed a\nmere trifle, and succeeded in borrowing forty thousand francs, on his\nsalary pledged for two years more; the banker stipulated that in the\nevent of Hulot's retirement on his pension, the whole of it should\nbe devoted to the repayment of the sum borrowed till the capital and\ninterest were all cleared off.\n\nThis new bargain, like the first, was made in the name of Vauvinet, to\nwhom the Baron signed notes of hand to the amount of twelve thousand\nfrancs.\n\nOn the following day, the fateful police report, the husband's charge,\nthe letters--all the papers--were destroyed. The scandalous promotion of\nMonsieur Marneffe, hardly heeded in the midst of the July fetes, was not\ncommented on in any newspaper.\n\nLisbeth, to all appearance at war with Madame Marneffe, had taken up\nher abode with Marshal Hulot. Ten days after these events, the banns of\nmarriage were published between the old maid and the distinguished old\nofficer, to whom, to win his consent, Adeline had related the financial\ndisaster that had befallen her Hector, begging him never to mention it\nto the Baron, who was, as she said, much saddened, quite depressed and\ncrushed.\n\n\"Alas! he is as old as his years,\" she added.\n\nSo Lisbeth had triumphed. She was achieving the object of her ambition,\nshe would see the success of her scheme, and her hatred gratified. She\ndelighted in the anticipated joy of reigning supreme over the family who\nhad so long looked down upon her. Yes, she would patronize her patrons,\nshe would be the rescuing angel who would dole out a livelihood to the\nruined family; she addressed herself as \"Madame la Comtesse\" and \"Madame\nla Marechale,\" courtesying in front of a glass. Adeline and Hortense\nshould end their days in struggling with poverty, while she, a visitor\nat the Tuileries, would lord it in the fashionable world.\n\n\n\nA terrible disaster overthrew the old maid from the social heights where\nshe so proudly enthroned herself.\n\nOn the very day when the banns were first published, the Baron received\na second message from Africa. Another Alsatian arrived, handed him a\nletter, after assuring himself that he spoke to Baron Hulot, and after\ngiving the Baron the address of his lodgings, bowed himself out, leaving\nthe great man stricken by the opening lines of this letter:--\n\n  \"DEAR NEPHEW,--You will receive this letter, by my calculations,\n  on the 7th of August. Supposing it takes you three days to send us\n  the help we need, and that it is a fortnight on the way here, that\n  brings us to the 1st of September.\n\n  \"If you can act decisively within that time, you will have saved\n  the honor and the life of yours sincerely, Johann Fischer.\n\n  \"This is what I am required to demand by the clerk you have made\n  my accomplice; for I am amenable, it would seem, to the law, at\n  the Assizes, or before a council of war. Of course, you understand\n  that Johann Fischer will never be brought to the bar of any\n  tribunal; he will go of his own act to appear at that of God.\n\n  \"Your clerk seems to me a bad lot, quite capable of getting you\n  into hot water; but he is as clever as any rogue. He says the line\n  for you to take is to call out louder than any one, and to send\n  out an inspector, a special commissioner, to discover who is\n  really guilty, rake up abuses, and make a fuss, in short; but if\n  we stir up the struggle, who will stand between us and the law?\n\n  \"If your commissioner arrives here by the 1st of September, and\n  you have given him your orders, sending by him two hundred\n  thousand francs to place in our storehouses the supplies we\n  profess to have secured in remote country places, we shall be\n  absolutely solvent and regarded as blameless. You can trust the\n  soldier who is the bearer of this letter with a draft in my name\n  on a house in Algiers. He is a trustworthy fellow, a relation of\n  mine, incapable of trying to find out what he is the bearer of. I\n  have taken measures to guarantee the fellow's safe return. If you\n  can do nothing, I am ready and willing to die for the man to whom\n  we owe our Adeline's happiness!\"\n\nThe anguish and raptures of passion and the catastrophe which had\nchecked his career of profligacy had prevented Baron Hulot's ever\nthinking of poor Johann Fischer, though his first letter had given\nwarning of the danger now become so pressing. The Baron went out of the\ndining-room in such agitation that he literally dropped on to a sofa in\nthe drawing-room. He was stunned, sunk in the dull numbness of a heavy\nfall. He stared at a flower on the carpet, quite unconscious that he\nstill held in his hand Johann's fatal letter.\n\nAdeline, in her room, heard her husband throw himself on the sofa, like\na lifeless mass; the noise was so peculiar that she fancied he had an\napoplectic attack. She looked through the door at the mirror, in such\ndread as stops the breath and hinders motion, and she saw her Hector in\nthe attitude of a man crushed. The Baroness stole in on tiptoe; Hector\nheard nothing; she went close up to him, saw the letter, took it, read\nit, trembling in every limb. She went through one of those violent\nnervous shocks that leave their traces for ever on the sufferer. Within\na few days she became subject to a constant trembling, for after the\nfirst instant the need for action gave her such strength as can only be\ndrawn from the very wellspring of the vital powers.\n\n\"Hector, come into my room,\" said she, in a voice that was no more than\na breath. \"Do not let your daughter see you in this state! Come, my\ndear, come!\"\n\n\"Two hundred thousand francs? Where can I find them? I can get Claude\nVignon sent out there as commissioner. He is a clever, intelligent\nfellow.--That is a matter of a couple of days.--But two hundred thousand\nfrancs! My son has not so much; his house is loaded with mortgages for\nthree hundred thousand. My brother has saved thirty thousand francs at\nmost. Nucingen would simply laugh at me!--Vauvinet?--he was not very\nready to lend me the ten thousand francs I wanted to make up the sum\nfor that villain Marneffe's boy. No, it is all up with me; I must throw\nmyself at the Prince's feet, confess how matters stand, hear myself told\nthat I am a low scoundrel, and take his broadside so as to go decently\nto the bottom.\"\n\n\"But, Hector, this is not merely ruin, it is disgrace,\" said Adeline.\n\"My poor uncle will kill himself. Only kill us--yourself and me; you\nhave a right to do that, but do not be a murderer! Come, take courage;\nthere must be some way out of it.\"\n\n\"Not one,\" said Hulot. \"No one in the Government could find two\nhundred thousand francs, not if it were to save an Administration!--Oh,\nNapoleon! where art thou?\"\n\n\"My uncle! poor man! Hector, he must not be allowed to kill himself in\ndisgrace.\"\n\n\"There is one more chance,\" said he, \"but a very remote one.--Yes,\nCrevel is at daggers drawn with his daughter.--He has plenty of money,\nhe alone could--\"\n\n\"Listen, Hector it will be better for your wife to perish than to leave\nour uncle to perish--and your brother--the honor of the family!\"\ncried the Baroness, struck by a flash of light. \"Yes, I can save you\nall.--Good God! what a degrading thought! How could it have occurred to\nme?\"\n\nShe clasped her hands, dropped on her knees, and put up a prayer. On\nrising, she saw such a crazy expression of joy on her husband's face,\nthat the diabolical suggestion returned, and then Adeline sank into a\nsort of idiotic melancholy.\n\n\"Go, my dear, at once to the War Office,\" said she, rousing herself from\nthis torpor; \"try to send out a commission; it must be done. Get\nround the Marshal. And on your return, at five o'clock, you will\nfind--perhaps--yes! you shall find two hundred thousand francs. Your\nfamily, your honor as a man, as a State official, a Councillor of State,\nyour honesty--your son--all shall be saved;--but your Adeline will be\nlost, and you will see her no more. Hector, my dear,\" said she, kneeling\nbefore him, clasping and kissing his hand, \"give me your blessing! Say\nfarewell.\"\n\nIt was so heart-rending that Hulot put his arms round his wife, raised\nher and kissed her, saying:\n\n\"I do not understand.\"\n\n\"If you did,\" said she, \"I should die of shame, or I should not have the\nstrength to carry out this last sacrifice.\"\n\n\"Breakfast is served,\" said Mariette.\n\nHortense came in to wish her parents good-morning. They had to go to\nbreakfast and assume a false face.\n\n\"Begin without me; I will join you,\" said the Baroness.\n\nShe sat down to her desk and wrote as follows:\n\n  \"MY DEAR MONSIEUR CREVEL,--I have to ask a service of you; I shall\n  expect you this morning, and I count on your gallantry, which is\n  well known to me, to save me from having too long to wait for you.\n  --Your faithful servant,\n\n  \"ADELINE HULOT.\"\n\n\n\"Louise,\" said she to her daughter's maid, who waited on her, \"take\nthis note down to the porter and desire him to carry it at once to this\naddress and wait for an answer.\"\n\nThe Baron, who was reading the news, held out a Republican paper to his\nwife, pointing to an article, and saying:\n\n\"Is there time?\"\n\nThis was the paragraph, one of the terrible \"notes\" with which the\npapers spice their political bread and butter:--\n\n  \"A correspondent in Algiers writes that such abuses have been\n  discovered in the commissariate transactions of the province of\n  Oran, that the Law is making inquiries. The peculation is\n  self-evident, and the guilty persons are known. If severe measures\n  are not taken, we shall continue to lose more men through the\n  extortion that limits their rations than by Arab steel or the\n  fierce heat of the climate. We await further information before\n  enlarging on this deplorable business. We need no longer wonder at\n  the terror caused by the establishment of the Press in Africa, as\n  was contemplated by the Charter of 1830.\"\n\n\"I will dress and go to the Minister,\" said the Baron, as they rose from\ntable. \"Time is precious; a man's life hangs on every minute.\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma, there is no hope for me!\" cried Hortense. And unable to\ncheck her tears, she handed to her mother a number of the _Revue des\nBeaux Arts_.\n\nMadame Hulot's eye fell on a print of the group of \"Delilah\" by\nCount Steinbock, under which were the words, \"The property of Madame\nMarneffe.\"\n\nThe very first lines of the article, signed V., showed the talent and\nfriendliness of Claude Vignon.\n\n\"Poor child!\" said the Baroness.\n\nAlarmed by her mother's tone of indifference, Hortense looked up, saw\nthe expression of a sorrow before which her own paled, and rose to kiss\nher mother, saying:\n\n\"What is the matter, mamma? What is happening? Can we be more wretched\nthan we are already?\"\n\n\"My child, it seems to me that in what I am going through to-day my past\ndreadful sorrows are as nothing. When shall I have ceased to suffer?\"\n\n\"In heaven, mother,\" said Hortense solemnly.\n\n\"Come, my angel, help me to dress.--No, no; I will not have you help me\nin this! Send me Louise.\"\n\nAdeline, in her room, went to study herself in the glass. She looked at\nherself closely and sadly, wondering to herself:\n\n\"Am I still handsome? Can I still be desirable? Am I not wrinkled?\"\n\nShe lifted up her fine golden hair, uncovering her temples; they were\nas fresh as a girl's. She went further; she uncovered her shoulders,\nand was satisfied; nay, she had a little feeling of pride. The beauty\nof really handsome shoulders is one of the last charms a woman loses,\nespecially if she has lived chastely.\n\nAdeline chose her dress carefully, but the pious and blameless woman is\ndecent to the end, in spite of her little coquettish graces. Of what use\nwere brand-new gray silk stockings and high heeled satin shoes when\nshe was absolutely ignorant of the art of displaying a pretty foot at\na critical moment, by obtruding it an inch or two beyond a half-lifted\nskirt, opening horizons to desire? She put on, indeed, her prettiest\nflowered muslin dress, with a low body and short sleeves; but horrified\nat so much bareness, she covered her fine arms with clear gauze\nsleeves and hid her shoulders under an embroidered cape. Her curls,\n_a l'Anglaise_, struck her as too fly-away; she subdued their airy\nlightness by putting on a very pretty cap; but, with or without the cap,\nwould she have known how to twist the golden ringlets so as to show off\nher taper fingers to admiration?\n\nAs to rouge--the consciousness of guilt, the preparations for a\ndeliberate fall, threw this saintly woman into a state of high fever,\nwhich, for the time, revived the brilliant coloring of youth. Her eyes\nwere bright, her cheeks glowed. Instead of assuming a seductive air, she\nsaw in herself a look of barefaced audacity which shocked her.\n\nLisbeth, at Adeline's request, had told her all the circumstances\nof Wenceslas' infidelity; and the Baroness had learned to her utter\namazement, that in one evening in one moment, Madame Marneffe had made\nherself the mistress of the bewitched artist.\n\n\"How do these women do it?\" the Baroness had asked Lisbeth.\n\nThere is no curiosity so great as that of virtuous women on such\nsubjects; they would like to know the arts of vice and remain\nimmaculate.\n\n\"Why, they are seductive; it is their business,\" said Cousin Betty.\n\"Valerie that evening, my dear, was, I declare, enough to bring an angel\nto perdition.\"\n\n\"But tell me how she set to work.\"\n\n\"There is no principle, only practice in that walk of life,\" said\nLisbeth ironically.\n\nThe Baroness, recalling this conversation, would have liked to consult\nCousin Betty; but there was no time for that. Poor Adeline, incapable of\nimagining a patch, of pinning a rosebud in the very middle of her bosom,\nof devising the tricks of the toilet intended to resuscitate the ardors\nof exhausted nature, was merely well dressed. A woman is not a courtesan\nfor the wishing!\n\n\"Woman is soup for man,\" as Moliere says by the mouth of the judicious\nGros-Rene. This comparison suggests a sort of culinary art in love. Then\nthe virtuous wife would be a Homeric meal, flesh laid on hot cinders.\nThe courtesan, on the contrary, is a dish by Careme, with its\ncondiments, spices, and elegant arrangement. The Baroness could not--did\nnot know how to serve up her fair bosom in a lordly dish of lace,\nafter the manner of Madame Marneffe. She knew nothing of the secrets of\ncertain attitudes. This high-souled woman might have turned round and\nround a hundred times, and she would have betrayed nothing to the keen\nglance of a profligate.\n\nTo be a good woman and a prude to all the world, and a courtesan to her\nhusband, is the gift of a woman of genius, and they are few. This is the\nsecret of long fidelity, inexplicable to the women who are not blessed\nwith the double and splendid faculty. Imagine Madame Marneffe virtuous,\nand you have the Marchesa di Pescara. But such lofty and illustrious\nwomen, beautiful as Diane de Poitiers, but virtuous, may be easily\ncounted.\n\nSo the scene with which this serious and terrible drama of Paris manners\nopened was about to be repeated, with this singular difference--that the\ncalamities prophesied then by the captain of the municipal Militia\nhad reversed the parts. Madame Hulot was awaiting Crevel with the same\nintentions as had brought him to her, smiling down at the Paris crowd\nfrom his _milord_, three years ago. And, strangest thing of all, the\nBaroness was true to herself and to her love, while preparing to yield\nto the grossest infidelity, such as the storm of passion even does not\njustify in the eyes of some judges.\n\n\"What can I do to become a Madame Marneffe?\" she asked herself as she\nheard the door-bell.\n\nShe restrained her tears, fever gave brilliancy to her face, and she\nmeant to be quite the courtesan, poor, noble soul.\n\n\n\n\"What the devil can that worthy Baronne Hulot want of me?\" Crevel\nwondered as he mounted the stairs. \"She is going to discuss my quarrel\nwith Celestine and Victorin, no doubt; but I will not give way!\"\n\nAs he went into the drawing-room, shown in by Louise, he said to himself\nas he noted the bareness of the place (Crevel's word):\n\n\"Poor woman! She lives here like some fine picture stowed in a loft by a\nman who knows nothing of painting.\"\n\nCrevel, seeing Comte Popinot, the Minister of Commerce, buy pictures and\nstatues, wanted also to figure as a Maecenas of Paris, whose love of Art\nconsists in making good investments.\n\nAdeline smiled graciously at Crevel, pointing to a chair facing her.\n\n\"Here I am, fair lady, at your command,\" said Crevel.\n\nMonsieur the Mayor, a political personage, now wore black broadcloth.\nHis face, at the top of this solemn suit, shone like a full moon rising\nabove a mass of dark clouds. His shirt, buttoned with three large pearls\nworth five hundred francs apiece, gave a great idea of his thoracic\ncapacity, and he was apt to say, \"In me you see the coming athlete of\nthe tribune!\" His enormous vulgar hands were encased in yellow\ngloves even in the morning; his patent leather boots spoke of the\nchocolate-colored coupe with one horse in which he drove.\n\nIn the course of three years ambition had altered Crevel's pretensions.\nLike all great artists, he had come to his second manner. In the great\nworld, when he went to the Prince de Wissembourg's, to the Prefecture,\nto Comte Popinot's, and the like, he held his hat in his hand in an airy\nmanner taught him by Valerie, and he inserted the thumb of the other\nhand in the armhole of his waistcoat with a knowing air, and a simpering\nface and expression. This new grace of attitude was due to the satirical\ninventiveness of Valerie, who, under pretence of rejuvenating her mayor,\nhad given him an added touch of the ridiculous.\n\n\"I begged you to come, my dear kind Monsieur Crevel,\" said the Baroness\nin a husky voice, \"on a matter of the greatest importance--\"\n\n\"I can guess what it is, madame,\" said Crevel, with a knowing air,\n\"but what you would ask is impossible.--Oh, I am not a brutal father, a\nman--to use Napoleon's words--set hard and fast on sheer avarice. Listen\nto me, fair lady. If my children were ruining themselves for their own\nbenefit, I would help them out of the scrape; but as for backing your\nhusband, madame? It is like trying to fill the vat of the Danaides!\nTheir house is mortgaged for three hundred thousand francs for an\nincorrigible father! Why, they have nothing left, poor wretches! And\nthey have no fun for their money. All they have to live upon is what\nVictorin may make in Court. He must wag his tongue more, must monsieur\nyour son! And he was to have been a Minister, that learned youth! Our\nhope and pride. A pretty pilot, who runs aground like a land-lubber; for\nif he had borrowed to enable him to get on, if he had run into debt for\nfeasting Deputies, winning votes, and increasing his influence, I should\nbe the first to say, 'Here is my purse--dip your hand in, my friend!'\nBut when it comes of paying for papa's folly--folly I warned you\nof!--Ah! his father has deprived him of every chance of power.--It is I\nwho shall be Minister!\"\n\n\"Alas, my dear Crevel, it has nothing to do with the children, poor\ndevoted souls!--If your heart is closed to Victorin and Celestine, I\nshall love them so much that perhaps I may soften the bitterness of\ntheir souls caused by your anger. You are punishing your children for a\ngood action!\"\n\n\"Yes, for a good action badly done! That is half a crime,\" said Crevel,\nmuch pleased with his epigram.\n\n\"Doing good, my dear Crevel, does not mean sparing money out of a purse\nthat is bursting with it; it means enduring privations to be generous,\nsuffering for liberality! It is being prepared for ingratitude! Heaven\ndoes not see the charity that costs us nothing--\"\n\n\"Saints, madame, may if they please go to the workhouse; they know that\nit is for them the door of heaven. For my part, I am worldly-minded; I\nfear God, but yet more I fear the hell of poverty. To be destitute is\nthe last depth of misfortune in society as now constituted. I am a man\nof my time; I respect money.\"\n\n\"And you are right,\" said Adeline, \"from the worldly point of view.\"\n\nShe was a thousand miles from her point, and she felt herself on a\ngridiron, like Saint Laurence, as she thought of her uncle, for she\ncould see him blowing his brains out.\n\nShe looked down; then she raised her eyes to gaze at Crevel with angelic\nsweetness--not with the inviting suggestiveness which was part of\nValerie's wit. Three years ago she could have bewitched Crevel by that\nbeautiful look.\n\n\"I have known the time,\" said she, \"when you were more generous--you\nused to talk of three hundred thousand francs like a grand gentleman--\"\n\nCrevel looked at Madame Hulot; he beheld her like a lily in the last of\nits bloom, vague sensations rose within him, but he felt such respect\nfor this saintly creature that he spurned all suspicions and buried them\nin the most profligate corner of his heart.\n\n\"I, madame, am still the same; but a retired merchant, if he is a grand\ngentleman, plays, and must play, the part with method and economy; he\ncarries his ideas of order into everything. He opens an account for\nhis little amusements, and devotes certain profits to that head of\nexpenditure; but as to touching his capital! it would be folly. My\nchildren will have their fortune intact, mine and my wife's; but I do\nnot suppose that they wish their father to be dull, a monk and a mummy!\nMy life is a very jolly one; I float gaily down the stream. I fulfil all\nthe duties imposed on me by law, by my affections, and by family ties,\njust as I always used to be punctual in paying my bills when they fell\ndue. If only my children conduct themselves in their domestic life as\nI do, I shall be satisfied; and for the present, so long as my\nfollies--for I have committed follies--are no loss to any one but the\ngulls--excuse me, you do not perhaps understand the slang word--they\nwill have nothing to blame me for, and will find a tidy little sum still\nleft when I die. Your children cannot say as much of their father, who\nis ruining his son and my daughter by his pranks--\"\n\nThe Baroness was getting further from her object as he went on.\n\n\"You are very unkind about my husband, my dear Crevel--and yet, if you\nhad found his wife obliging, you would have been his best friend----\"\n\nShe shot a burning glance at Crevel; but, like Dubois, who gave the\nRegent three kicks, she affected too much, and the rakish perfumer's\nthoughts jumped at such profligate suggestions, that he said to himself,\n\"Does she want to turn the tables on Hulot?--Does she think me more\nattractive as a Mayor than as a National Guardsman? Women are strange\ncreatures!\"\n\nAnd he assumed the position of his second manner, looking at the\nBaroness with his _Regency_ leer.\n\n\"I could almost fancy,\" she went on, \"that you want to visit on him your\nresentment against the virtue that resisted you--in a woman whom you\nloved well enough--to--to buy her,\" she added in a low voice.\n\n\"In a divine woman,\" Crevel replied, with a meaning smile at the\nBaroness, who looked down while tears rose to her eyes. \"For you\nhave swallowed not a few bitter pills!--in these three years--hey, my\nbeauty?\"\n\n\"Do not talk of my troubles, dear Crevel; they are too much for the\nendurance of a mere human being. Ah! if you still love me, you may\ndrag me out of the pit in which I lie. Yes, I am in hell torment! The\nregicides who were racked and nipped and torn into quarters by four\nhorses were on roses compared with me, for their bodies only were\ndismembered, and my heart is torn in quarters----\"\n\nCrevel's thumb moved from his armhole, he placed his hand on the\nwork-table, he abandoned his attitude, he smiled! The smile was so\nvacuous that it misled the Baroness; she took it for an expression of\nkindness.\n\n\"You see a woman, not indeed in despair, but with her honor at the\npoint of death, and prepared for everything, my dear friend, to hinder a\ncrime.\"\n\nFearing that Hortense might come in, she bolted the door; then with\nequal impetuosity she fell at Crevel's feet, took his hand and kissed\nit.\n\n\"Be my deliverer!\" she cried.\n\nShe thought there was some generous fibre in this mercantile soul, and\nfull of sudden hope that she might get the two hundred thousand francs\nwithout degrading herself:\n\n\"Buy a soul--you were once ready to buy virtue!\" she went on, with a\nfrenzied gaze. \"Trust to my honesty as a woman, to my honor, of which\nyou know the worth! Be my friend! Save a whole family from ruin, shame,\ndespair; keep it from falling into a bog where the quicksands are\nmingled with blood! Oh! ask for no explanations,\" she exclaimed, at a\nmovement on Crevel's part, who was about to speak. \"Above all, do not\nsay to me, 'I told you so!' like a friend who is glad at a misfortune.\nCome now, yield to her whom you used to love, to the woman whose\nhumiliation at your feet is perhaps the crowning moment of her glory;\nask nothing of her, expect what you will from her gratitude!--No, no.\nGive me nothing, but lend--lend to me whom you used to call Adeline----\"\n\nAt this point her tears flowed so fast, Adeline was sobbing so\npassionately, that Crevel's gloves were wet. The words, \"I need two\nhundred thousand francs,\" were scarcely articulate in the torrent of\nweeping, as stones, however large, are invisible in Alpine cataracts\nswollen by the melting of the snows.\n\nThis is the inexperience of virtue. Vice asks for nothing, as we have\nseen in Madame Marneffe; it gets everything offered to it. Women of that\nstamp are never exacting till they have made themselves indispensable,\nor when a man has to be worked as a quarry is worked where the lime is\nrather scarce--going to ruin, as the quarry-men say.\n\nOn hearing these words, \"Two hundred thousand francs,\" Crevel understood\nall. He cheerfully raised the Baroness, saying insolently:\n\n\"Come, come, bear up, mother,\" which Adeline, in her distraction, failed\nto hear. The scene was changing its character. Crevel was becoming\n\"master of the situation,\" to use his own words. The vastness of the\nsum startled Crevel so greatly that his emotion at seeing this handsome\nwoman in tears at his feet was forgotten. Besides, however angelical\nand saintly a woman may be, when she is crying bitterly her beauty\ndisappears. A Madame Marneffe, as has been seen, whimpers now and then,\na tear trickles down her cheek; but as to melting into tears and making\nher eyes and nose red!--never would she commit such a blunder.\n\n\"Come, child, compose yourself.--Deuce take it!\" Crevel went on, taking\nMadame Hulot's hands in his own and patting them. \"Why do you apply to\nme for two hundred thousand francs? What do you want with them? Whom are\nthey for?\"\n\n\"Do not,\" said she, \"insist on any explanations. Give me the money!--You\nwill save three lives and the honor of our children.\"\n\n\"And do you suppose, my good mother, that in all Paris you will find a\nman who at a word from a half-crazy woman will go off _hic et nunc_,\nand bring out of some drawer, Heaven knows where, two hundred thousand\nfrancs that have been lying simmering there till she is pleased to scoop\nthem up? Is that all you know of life and of business, my beauty? Your\nfolks are in a bad way; you may send them the last sacraments; for no\none in Paris but her Divine Highness Madame la Banque, or the great\nNucingen, or some miserable miser who is in love with gold as we other\nfolks are with a woman, could produce such a miracle! The civil list,\ncivil as it may be, would beg you to call again tomorrow. Every one\ninvests his money, and turns it over to the best of his powers.\n\n\"You are quite mistaken, my angel, if you suppose that King\nLouis-Philippe rules us; he himself knows better than that. He knows as\nwell as we do that supreme above the Charter reigns the holy, venerated,\nsubstantial, delightful, obliging, beautiful, noble, ever-youthful,\nand all-powerful five-franc piece! But money, my beauty, insists on\ninterest, and is always engaged in seeking it! 'God of the Jews, thou\nart supreme!' says Racine. The perennial parable of the golden calf, you\nsee!--In the days of Moses there was stock-jobbing in the desert!\n\n\"We have reverted to Biblical traditions; the Golden Calf was the first\nState ledger,\" he went on. \"You, my Adeline, have not gone beyond the\nRue Plumet. The Egyptians had lent enormous sums to the Hebrews, and\nwhat they ran after was not God's people, but their capital.\"\n\nHe looked at the Baroness with an expression which said, \"How clever I\nam!\"\n\n\"You know nothing of the devotion of every city man to his sacred\nhoard!\" he went on, after a pause. \"Excuse me. Listen to me. Get this\nwell into your head.--You want two hundred thousand francs? No one can\nproduce the sum without selling some security. Now consider! To have two\nhundred thousand francs in hard cash it would be needful to sell about\nseven hundred thousand francs' worth of stock at three per cent. Well;\nand then you would only get the money on the third day. That is the\nquickest way. To persuade a man to part with a fortune--for two hundred\nthousand francs is the whole fortune of many a man--he ought at least to\nknow where it is all going to, and for what purpose--\"\n\n\"It is going, my dear kind Crevel, to save the lives of two men, one of\nwhom will die of grief and the other will kill himself! And to save me\ntoo from going mad! Am I not a little mad already?\"\n\n\"Not so mad!\" said he, taking Madame Hulot round the knees; \"old Crevel\nhas his price, since you thought of applying to him, my angel.\"\n\n\"They submit to have a man's arms round their knees, it would seem!\"\nthought the saintly woman, covering her face with her hands.\n\n\"Once you offered me a fortune!\" said she, turning red.\n\n\"Ay, mother! but that was three years ago!\" replied Crevel. \"Well, you\nare handsomer now than ever I saw you!\" he went on, taking the Baroness'\narm and pressing it to his heart. \"You have a good memory, my dear, by\nJove!--And now you see how wrong you were to be so prudish, for those\nthree hundred thousand francs that you refused so magnanimously are in\nanother woman's pocket. I loved you then, I love you still; but just\nlook back these three years.\n\n\"When I said to you, 'You shall be mine,' what object had I in view? I\nmeant to be revenged on that rascal Hulot. But your husband, my beauty,\nfound himself a mistress--a jewel of a woman, a pearl, a cunning hussy\nthen aged three-and-twenty, for she is six-and-twenty now. It struck\nme as more amusing, more complete, more Louis XV., more Marechal de\nRichelieu, more first-class altogether, to filch away that charmer, who,\nin point of fact, never cared for Hulot, and who for these three years\nhas been madly in love with your humble servant.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Crevel, from whose hands the Baroness had released her\nown, had resumed his favorite attitude; both thumbs were stuck into\nhis armholes, and he was patting his ribs with his fingers, like two\nflapping wings, fancying that he was thus making himself very attractive\nand charming. It was as much as to say, \"And this is the man you would\nhave nothing to say to!\"\n\n\"There you are my dear; I had my revenge, and your husband knows it. I\nproved to him clearly that he was basketed--just where he was before, as\nwe say. Madame Marneffe is my mistress, and when her precious Marneffe\nkicks the bucket, she will be my wife.\"\n\nMadame Hulot stared at Crevel with a fixed and almost dazed look.\n\n\"Hector knew it?\" she said.\n\n\"And went back to her,\" replied Crevel. \"And I allowed it, because\nValerie wished to be the wife of a head-clerk; but she promised me\nthat she would manage things so that our Baron should be so effectually\nbowled over that he can never interfere any more. And my little\nduchess--for that woman is a born duchess, on my soul!--kept her word.\nShe restores you your Hector, madame, virtuous in perpetuity, as she\nsays--she is so witty! He has had a good lesson, I can tell you! The\nBaron has had some hard knocks; he will help no more actresses or fine\nladies; he is radically cured; cleaned out like a beer-glass.\n\n\"If you had listened to Crevel in the first instance, instead of\nscorning him and turning him out of the house, you might have had four\nhundred thousand francs, for my revenge has cost me all of that.--But I\nshall get my change back, I hope, when Marneffe dies--I have invested\nin a wife, you see; that is the secret of my extravagance. I have solved\nthe problem of playing the lord on easy terms.\"\n\n\"Would you give your daughter such a mother-in-law? cried Madame Hulot.\n\n\"You do not know Valerie, madame,\" replied Crevel gravely, striking the\nattitude of his first manner. \"She is a woman with good blood in her\nveins, a lady, and a woman who enjoys the highest consideration. Why,\nonly yesterday the vicar of the parish was dining with her. She is\npious, and we have presented a splendid monstrance to the church.\n\n\"Oh! she is clever, she is witty, she is delightful, well informed--she\nhas everything in her favor. For my part, my dear Adeline, I owe\neverything to that charming woman; she has opened my mind, polished my\nspeech, as you may have noticed; she corrects my impetuosity, and gives\nme words and ideas. I never say anything now that I ought not. I have\ngreatly improved; you must have noticed it. And then she has encouraged\nmy ambition. I shall be a Deputy; and I shall make no blunders, for\nI shall consult my Egeria. Every great politician, from Numa to our\npresent Prime Minister, has had his Sibyl of the fountain. A score of\ndeputies visit Valerie; she is acquiring considerable influence; and\nnow that she is about to be established in a charming house, with a\ncarriage, she will be one of the occult rulers of Paris.\n\n\"A fine locomotive! That is what such a woman is. Oh, I have blessed you\nmany a time for your stern virtue.\"\n\n\"It is enough to make one doubt the goodness of God!\" cried Adeline,\nwhose indignation had dried her tears. \"But, no! Divine justice must be\nhanging over her head.\"\n\n\"You know nothing of the world, my beauty,\" said the great politician,\ndeeply offended. \"The world, my Adeline, loves success! Say, now, has\nit come to seek out your sublime virtue, priced at two hundred thousand\nfrancs?\"\n\nThe words made Madame Hulot shudder; the nervous trembling attacked her\nonce more. She saw that the ex-perfumer was taking a mean revenge on her\nas he had on Hulot; she felt sick with disgust, and a spasm rose to her\nthroat, hindering speech.\n\n\"Money!\" she said at last. \"Always money!\"\n\n\"You touched me deeply,\" said Crevel, reminded by these words of the\nwoman's humiliation, \"when I beheld you there, weeping at my feet!--You\nperhaps will not believe me, but if I had my pocket-book about me, it\nwould have been yours.--Come, do you really want such a sum?\"\n\nAs she heard this question, big with two hundred thousand francs,\nAdeline forgot the odious insults heaped on her by this cheap-jack\nfine gentleman, before the tempting picture of success described by\nMachiavelli-Crevel, who only wanted to find out her secrets and laugh\nover them with Valerie.\n\n\"Oh! I will do anything, everything,\" cried the unhappy woman.\n\"Monsieur, I will sell myself--I will be a Valerie, if I must.\"\n\n\"You will find that difficult,\" replied Crevel. \"Valerie is a\nmasterpiece in her way. My good mother, twenty-five years of virtue\nare always repellent, like a badly treated disease. And your virtue has\ngrown very mouldy, my dear child. But you shall see how much I love you.\nI will manage to get you your two hundred thousand francs.\"\n\nAdeline, incapable of uttering a word, seized his hand and laid it on\nher heart; a tear of joy trembled in her eyes.\n\n\"Oh! don't be in a hurry; there will be some hard pulling. I am a jolly\ngood fellow, a good soul with no prejudices, and I will put things\nplainly to you. You want to do as Valerie does--very good. But that is\nnot all; you must have a gull, a stockholder, a Hulot.--Well, I know\na retired tradesman--in fact, a hosier. He is heavy, dull, has not an\nidea, I am licking him into shape, but I don't know when he will do\nme credit. My man is a deputy, stupid and conceited; the tyranny of\na turbaned wife, in the depths of the country, has preserved him in a\nstate of utter virginity as to the luxury and pleasures of Paris life.\nBut Beauvisage--his name is Beauvisage--is a millionaire, and, like me,\nmy dear, three years ago, he will give a hundred thousand crowns to be\nthe lover of a real lady.--Yes, you see,\" he went on, misunderstanding a\ngesture on Adeline's part, \"he is jealous of me, you understand; jealous\nof my happiness with Madame Marneffe, and he is a fellow quite capable\nof selling an estate to purchase a--\"\n\n\"Enough, Monsieur Crevel!\" said Madame Hulot, no longer controlling her\ndisgust, and showing all her shame in her face. \"I am punished beyond\nmy deserts. My conscience, so sternly repressed by the iron hand of\nnecessity, tells me, at this final insult, that such sacrifices are\nimpossible.--My pride is gone; I do not say now, as I did the first\ntime, 'Go!' after receiving this mortal thrust. I have lost the right to\ndo so. I have flung myself before you like a prostitute.\n\n\"Yes,\" she went on, in reply to a negative on Crevel's part, \"I have\nfouled my life, till now so pure, by a degrading thought; and I am\ninexcusable!--I know it!--I deserve every insult you can offer me! God's\nwill be done! If, indeed, He desires the death of two creatures worthy\nto appear before Him, they must die! I shall mourn them, and pray for\nthem! If it is His will that my family should be humbled to the dust,\nwe must bow to His avenging sword, nay, and kiss it, since we are\nChristians.--I know how to expiate this disgrace, which will be the\ntorment of all my remaining days.\n\n\"I who speak to you, monsieur, am not Madame Hulot, but a wretched,\nhumble sinner, a Christian whose heart henceforth will know but one\nfeeling, and that is repentance, all my time given up to prayer and\ncharity. With such a sin on my soul, I am the last of women, the first\nonly of penitents.--You have been the means of bringing me to a right\nmind; I can hear the Voice of God speaking within me, and I can thank\nyou!\"\n\nShe was shaking with the nervous trembling which from that hour never\nleft her. Her low, sweet tones were quite unlike the fevered accents of\nthe woman who was ready for dishonor to save her family. The blood faded\nfrom her cheeks, her face was colorless, and her eyes were dry.\n\n\"And I played my part very badly, did I not?\" she went on, looking at\nCrevel with the sweetness that martyrs must have shown in their eyes\nas they looked up at the Proconsul. \"True love, the sacred love of a\ndevoted woman, gives other pleasures, no doubt, than those that are\nbought in the open market!--But why so many words?\" said she, suddenly\nbethinking herself, and advancing a step further in the way to\nperfection. \"They sound like irony, but I am not ironical! Forgive me.\nBesides, monsieur, I did not want to hurt any one but myself--\"\n\nThe dignity of virtue and its holy flame had expelled the transient\nimpurity of the woman who, splendid in her own peculiar beauty, looked\ntaller in Crevel's eyes. Adeline had, at this moment, the majesty of\nthe figures of Religion clinging to the Cross, as painted by the old\nVenetians; but she expressed, too, the immensity of her love and the\ngrandeur of the Catholic Church, to which she flew like a wounded dove.\n\nCrevel was dazzled, astounded.\n\n\"Madame, I am your slave, without conditions,\" said he, in an\ninspiration of generosity. \"We will look into this matter--and--whatever\nyou want--the impossible even--I will do. I will pledge my securities at\nthe Bank, and in two hours you shall have the money.\"\n\n\"Good God! a miracle!\" said poor Adeline, falling on her knees.\n\nShe prayed to Heaven with such fervor as touched Crevel deeply; Madame\nHulot saw that he had tears in his eyes when, having ended her prayer,\nshe rose to her feet.\n\n\"Be a friend to me, monsieur,\" said she. \"Your heart is better than your\nwords and conduct. God gave you your soul; your passions and the world\nhave given you your ideas. Oh, I will love you truly,\" she exclaimed,\nwith an angelic tenderness in strange contrast with her attempts at\ncoquettish trickery.\n\n\"But cease to tremble so,\" said Crevel.\n\n\"Am I trembling?\" said the Baroness, unconscious of the infirmity that\nhad so suddenly come upon her.\n\n\"Yes; why, look,\" said Crevel, taking Adeline by the arm and showing\nher that she was shaking with nervousness. \"Come, madame,\" he added\nrespectfully, \"compose yourself; I am going to the Bank at once.\"\n\n\"And come back quickly! Remember,\" she added, betraying all her secrets,\n\"that the first point is to prevent the suicide of our poor Uncle\nFischer involved by my husband--for I trust you now, and I am\ntelling you everything. Oh, if we should not be on time, I know my\nbrother-in-law, the Marshal, and he has such a delicate soul, that he\nwould die of it in a few days.\"\n\n\"I am off, then,\" said Crevel, kissing the Baroness' hand. \"But what has\nthat unhappy Hulot done?\"\n\n\"He has swindled the Government.\"\n\n\"Good Heavens! I fly, madame; I understand, I admire you!\"\n\nCrevel bent one knee, kissed Madame Hulot's skirt, and vanished, saying,\n\"You will see me soon.\"\n\nUnluckily, on his way from the Rue Plumet to his own house, to fetch the\nsecurities, Crevel went along the Rue Vanneau, and he could not resist\ngoing in to see his little Duchess. His face still bore an agitated\nexpression.\n\nHe went straight into Valerie's room, who was having her hair dressed.\nShe looked at Crevel in her glass, and, like every woman of that sort,\nwas annoyed, before she knew anything about it, to see that he was moved\nby some strong feeling of which she was not the cause.\n\n\"What is the matter, my dear?\" said she. \"Is that a face to bring in to\nyour little Duchess? I will not be your Duchess any more, monsieur, no\nmore than I will be your 'little duck,' you old monster.\"\n\nCrevel replied by a melancholy smile and a glance at the maid.\n\n\"Reine, child, that will do for to-day; I can finish my hair myself.\nGive me my Chinese wrapper; my gentleman seems to me out of sorts.\"\n\nReine, whose face was pitted like a colander, and who seemed to have\nbeen made on purpose to wait on Valerie, smiled meaningly in reply, and\nbrought the dressing-gown. Valerie took off her combing-wrapper; she was\nin her shift, and she wriggled into the dressing-gown like a snake into\na clump of grass.\n\n\"Madame is not at home?\"\n\n\"What a question!\" said Valerie.--\"Come, tell me, my big puss, have\n_Rives Gauches_ gone down?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"They have raised the price of the house?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You fancy that you are not the father of our little Crevel?\"\n\n\"What nonsense!\" replied he, sure of his paternity.\n\n\"On my honor, I give it up!\" said Madame Marneffe. \"If I am expected\nto extract my friend's woes as you pull the cork out of a bottle of\nBordeaux, I let it alone.--Go away, you bore me.\"\n\n\"It is nothing,\" said Crevel. \"I must find two hundred thousand francs\nin two hours.\"\n\n\"Oh, you can easily get them.--I have not spent the fifty thousand\nfrancs we got out of Hulot for that report, and I can ask Henri for\nfifty thousand--\"\n\n\"Henri--it is always Henri!\" exclaimed Crevel.\n\n\"And do you suppose, you great baby of a Machiavelli, that I will cast\noff Henri? Would France disarm her fleet?--Henri! why, he is a dagger in\na sheath hanging on a nail. That boy serves as a weather-glass to show\nme if you love me--and you don't love me this morning.\"\n\n\"I don't love you, Valerie?\" cried Crevel. \"I love you as much as a\nmillion.\"\n\n\"That is not nearly enough!\" cried she, jumping on to Crevel's knee, and\nthrowing both arms round his neck as if it were a peg to hang on by. \"I\nwant to be loved as much as ten millions, as much as all the gold in the\nworld, and more to that. Henri would never wait a minute before telling\nme all he had on his mind. What is it, my great pet? Have it out. Make a\nclean breast of it to your own little duck!\"\n\nAnd she swept her hair over Crevel's face, while she jestingly pulled\nhis nose.\n\n\"Can a man with a nose like that,\" she went on, \"have any secrets from\nhis _Vava--lele--ririe_?\"\n\nAnd at the _Vava_ she tweaked his nose to the right; at _lele_ it went\nto the left; at _ririe_ she nipped it straight again.\n\n\"Well, I have just seen--\" Crevel stopped and looked at Madame Marneffe.\n\n\"Valerie, my treasure, promise me on your honor--ours, you know?--not to\nrepeat a single word of what I tell you.\"\n\n\"Of course, Mayor, we know all about that. One hand up--so--and one\nfoot--so!\" And she put herself in an attitude which, to use Rabelais'\nphrase, stripped Crevel bare from his brain to his heels, so quaint and\ndelicious was the nudity revealed through the light film of lawn.\n\n\"I have just seen virtue in despair.\"\n\n\"Can despair possess virtue?\" said she, nodding gravely and crossing her\narms like Napoleon.\n\n\"It is poor Madame Hulot. She wants two hundred thousand francs, or else\nMarshal Hulot and old Johann Fischer will blow their brains out; and as\nyou, my little Duchess, are partly at the bottom of the mischief, I am\ngoing to patch matters up. She is a saintly creature, I know her well;\nshe will repay you every penny.\"\n\nAt the name of Hulot, at the words two hundred thousand francs, a gleam\nfrom Valerie's eyes flashed from between her long eyelids like the flame\nof a cannon through the smoke.\n\n\"What did the old thing do to move you to compassion? Did she show\nyou--what?--her--her religion?\"\n\n\"Do not make game of her, sweetheart; she is a very saintly, a very\nnoble and pious woman, worthy of all respect.\"\n\n\"Am I not worthy of respect then, heh?\" answered Valerie, with a\nthreatening gaze at Crevel.\n\n\"I never said so,\" replied he, understanding that the praise of virtue\nmight not be gratifying to Madame Marneffe.\n\n\"I am pious too,\" Valerie went on, taking her seat in an armchair; \"but\nI do not make a trade of my religion. I go to church in secret.\"\n\nShe sat in silence, and paid no further heed to Crevel. He, extremely\nill at ease, came to stand in front of the chair into which Valerie\nhad thrown herself, and saw her lost in the reflections he had been so\nfoolish as to suggest.\n\n\"Valerie, my little Angel!\"\n\nUtter silence. A highly problematical tear was furtively dashed away.\n\n\"One word, my little duck?\"\n\n\"Monsieur!\"\n\n\"What are you thinking of, my darling?\"\n\n\"Oh, Monsieur Crevel, I was thinking of the day of my first communion!\nHow pretty I was! How pure, how saintly!--immaculate!--Oh! if any one\nhad come to my mother and said, 'Your daughter will be a hussy, and\nunfaithful to her husband; one day a police-officer will find her in\na disreputable house; she will sell herself to a Crevel to cheat a\nHulot--two horrible old men--' Poof! horrible--she would have died\nbefore the end of the sentence, she was so fond of me, poor dear!--\"\n\n\"Nay, be calm.\"\n\n\"You cannot think how well a woman must love a man before she can\nsilence the remorse that gnaws at the heart of an adulterous wife. I\nam quite sorry that Reine is not here; she would have told you that she\nfound me this morning praying with tears in my eyes. I, Monsieur Crevel,\nfor my part, do not make a mockery of religion. Have you ever heard me\nsay a word I ought not on such a subject?\"\n\nCrevel shook his head in negation.\n\n\"I will never allow it to be mentioned in my presence. I can make fun\nof anything under the sun: Kings, politics, finance, everything that is\nsacred in the eyes of the world--judges, matrimony, and love--old men\nand maidens. But the Church and God!--There I draw the line.--I know\nI am wicked; I am sacrificing my future life to you. And you have no\nconception of the immensity of my love.\"\n\nCrevel clasped his hands.\n\n\"No, unless you could see into my heart, and fathom the depth of my\nconviction so as to know the extent of my sacrifice! I feel in me the\nmaking of a Magdalen.--And see how respectfully I treat the priests;\nthink of the gifts I make to the Church! My mother brought me up in the\nCatholic Faith, and I know what is meant by God! It is to sinners like\nus that His voice is most awful.\"\n\nValerie wiped away two tears that trickled down her cheeks. Crevel was\nin dismay. Madame Marneffe stood up in her excitement.\n\n\"Be calm, my darling--you alarm me!\"\n\nMadame Marneffe fell on her knees.\n\n\"Dear Heaven! I am not bad all through!\" she cried, clasping her hands.\n\"Vouchsafe to rescue Thy wandering lamb, strike her, crush her, snatch\nher from foul and adulterous hands, and how gladly she will nestle on\nThy shoulder! How willingly she will return to the fold!\"\n\nShe got up and looked at Crevel; her colorless eyes frightened him.\n\n\"Yes, Crevel, and, do you know? I, too, am frightened sometimes. The\njustice of God is exerted in this nether world as well as in the next.\nWhat mercy can I expect at God's hands? His vengeance overtakes the\nguilty in many ways; it assumes every aspect of disaster. That is what\nmy mother told me on her death-bed, speaking of her own old age.--But\nif I should lose you,\" she added, hugging Crevel with a sort of savage\nfrenzy--\"oh! I should die!\"\n\nMadame Marneffe released Crevel, knelt down again at the armchair,\nfolded her hands--and in what a bewitching attitude!--and with\nincredible fervor poured out the following prayer:--\n\n\"And thou, Saint Valerie, my patron saint, why dost thou so rarely visit\nthe pillow of her who was intrusted to thy care? Oh, come this evening,\nas thou didst this morning, to inspire me with holy thoughts, and I will\nquit the path of sin; like the Magdalen, I will give up deluding joys\nand the false glitter of the world, even the man I love so well--\"\n\n\"My precious duck!\"\n\n\"No more of the 'precious duck,' monsieur!\" said she, turning round\nlike a virtuous wife, her eyes full of tears, but dignified, cold, and\nindifferent.\n\n\"Leave me,\" she went on, pushing him from her. \"What is my duty? To\nbelong wholly to my husband.--He is a dying man, and what am I doing?\nDeceiving him on the edge of the grave. He believes your child to be\nhis. I will tell him the truth, and begin by securing his pardon before\nI ask for God's.--We must part. Good-bye, Monsieur Crevel,\" and she\nstood up to offer him an icy cold hand. \"Good-bye, my friend; we shall\nmeet no more till we meet in a better world.--You have to thank me for\nsome enjoyment, criminal indeed; now I want--oh yes, I shall have your\nesteem.\"\n\nCrevel was weeping bitter tears.\n\n\"You great pumpkin!\" she exclaimed, with an infernal peal of laughter.\n\"That is how your pious women go about it to drag from you a plum of two\nhundred thousand francs. And you, who talk of the Marechal de Richelieu,\nthe prototype of Lovelace, you could be taken in by such a stale trick\nas that! I could get hundreds of thousands of francs out of you any day,\nif I chose, you old ninny!--Keep your money! If you have more than\nyou know what to do with, it is mine. If you give two sous to that\n'respectable' woman, who is pious forsooth, because she is fifty-six\nyears of age, we shall never meet again, and you may take her for your\nmistress! You could come back to me next day bruised all over from\nher bony caresses and sodden with her tears, and sick of her little\nbarmaid's caps and her whimpering, which must turn her favors into\nshowers--\"\n\n\"In point of fact,\" said Crevel, \"two hundred thousand francs is a round\nsum of money.\"\n\n\"They have fine appetites, have the goody sort! By the poker! they\nsell their sermons dearer than we sell the rarest and realest thing on\nearth--pleasure.--And they can spin a yarn! There, I know them. I have\nseen plenty in my mother's house. They think everything is allowable\nfor the Church and for--Really, my dear love, you ought to be ashamed\nof yourself--for you are not so open-handed! You have not given me two\nhundred thousand francs all told!\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Crevel, \"your little house will cost as much as that.\"\n\n\"Then you have four hundred thousand francs?\" said she thoughtfully.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, you meant to lend that old horror the two hundred thousand\nfrancs due for my hotel? What a crime, what high treason!\"\n\n\"Only listen to me.\"\n\n\"If you were giving the money to some idiotic philanthropic scheme,\nyou would be regarded as a coming man,\" she went on, with increasing\neagerness, \"and I should be the first to advise it; for you are too\nsimple to write a big political book that might make you famous; as for\nstyle, you have not enough to butter a pamphlet; but you might do as\nother men do who are in your predicament, and who get a halo of glory\nabout their name by putting it at the top of some social, or moral,\nor general, or national enterprise. Benevolence is out of date, quite\nvulgar. Providing for old offenders, and making them more comfortable\nthan the poor devils who are honest, is played out. What I should like\nto see is some invention of your own with an endowment of two hundred\nthousand francs--something difficult and really useful. Then you would\nbe talked about as a man of mark, a Montyon, and I should be very proud\nof you!\n\n\"But as to throwing two hundred thousand francs into a holy-water shell,\nor lending them to a bigot--cast off by her husband, and who knows why?\nthere is always some reason: does any one cast me off, I ask you?--is\na piece of idiocy which in our days could only come into the head of a\nretired perfumer. It reeks of the counter. You would not dare look at\nyourself in the glass two days after.\n\n\"Go and pay the money in where it will be safe--run, fly; I will not\nadmit you again without the receipt in your hand. Go, as fast and soon\nas you can!\"\n\nShe pushed Crevel out of the room by the shoulders, seeing avarice\nblossoming in his face once more. When she heard the outer door shut,\nshe exclaimed:\n\n\"Then Lisbeth is revenged over and over again! What a pity that she is\nat her old Marshal's now! We would have had a good laugh! So that old\nwoman wants to take the bread out of my mouth. I will startle her a\nlittle!\"\n\n\n\nMarshal Hulot, being obliged to live in a style suited to the highest\nmilitary rank, had taken a handsome house in the Rue du Mont-Parnasse,\nwhere there are three or four princely residences. Though he rented the\nwhole house, he inhabited only the ground floor. When Lisbeth went to\nkeep house for him, she at once wished to let the first floor, which, as\nshe said, would pay the whole rent, so that the Count would live almost\nrent-free; but the old soldier would not hear of it.\n\nFor some months past the Marshal had had many sad thoughts. He had\nguessed how miserably poor his sister-in-law was, and suspected her\ngriefs without understanding their cause. The old man, so cheerful in\nhis deafness, became taciturn; he could not help thinking that his house\nwould one day be a refuge for the Baroness and her daughter; and it was\nfor them that he kept the first floor. The smallness of his fortune\nwas so well known at headquarters, that the War Minister, the Prince\nde Wissembourg, begged his old comrade to accept a sum of money for his\nhousehold expenses. This sum the Marshal spent in furnishing the ground\nfloor, which was in every way suitable; for, as he said, he would not\naccept the Marshal's baton to walk the streets with.\n\nThe house had belonged to a senator under the Empire, and the ground\nfloor drawing-rooms had been very magnificently fitted with carved wood,\nwhite-and-gold, still in very good preservation. The Marshal had found\nsome good old furniture in the same style; in the coach-house he had\na carriage with two batons in saltire on the panels; and when he was\nexpected to appear in full fig, at the Minister's, at the Tuileries, for\nsome ceremony or high festival, he hired horses for the job.\n\nHis servant for more than thirty years was an old soldier of sixty,\nwhose sister was the cook, so he had saved ten thousand francs, adding\nit by degrees to a little hoard he intended for Hortense. Every day the\nold man walked along the boulevard, from the Rue du Mont-Parnasse to the\nRue Plumet; and every pensioner as he passed stood at attention, without\nfail, to salute him: then the Marshal rewarded the veteran with a smile.\n\n\"Who is the man you always stand at attention to salute?\" said a young\nworkman one day to an old captain and pensioner.\n\n\"I will tell you, boy,\" replied the officer.\n\nThe \"boy\" stood resigned, as a man does to listen to an old gossip.\n\n\"In 1809,\" said the captain, \"we were covering the flank of the main\narmy, marching on Vienna under the Emperor's command. We came to a\nbridge defended by three batteries of cannon, one above another, on a\nsort of cliff; three redoubts like three shelves, and commanding the\nbridge. We were under Marshal Massena. That man whom you see there was\nColonel of the Grenadier Guards, and I was one of them. Our columns held\none bank of the river, the batteries were on the other. Three times they\ntried for the bridge, and three times they were driven back. 'Go and\nfind Hulot!' said the Marshal; 'nobody but he and his men can bolt that\nmorsel.' So we came. The General, who was just retiring from the bridge,\nstopped Hulot under fire, to tell him how to do it, and he was in the\nway. 'I don't want advice, but room to pass,' said our General coolly,\nmarching across at the head of his men. And then, rattle, thirty guns\nraking us at once.\"\n\n\"By Heaven!\" cried the workman, \"that accounts for some of these\ncrutches!\"\n\n\"And if you, like me, my boy, had heard those words so quietly spoken,\nyou would bow before that man down to the ground! It is not so famous as\nArcole, but perhaps it was finer. We followed Hulot at the double, right\nup to those batteries. All honor to those we left there!\" and the old\nman lifted his hat. \"The Austrians were amazed at the dash of it.--The\nEmperor made the man you saw a Count; he honored us all by honoring our\nleader; and the King of to-day was very right to make him a Marshal.\"\n\n\"Hurrah for the Marshal!\" cried the workman.\n\n\"Oh, you may shout--shout away! The Marshal is as deaf as a post from\nthe roar of cannon.\"\n\nThis anecdote may give some idea of the respect with which the\n_Invalides_ regarded Marshal Hulot, whose Republican proclivities\nsecured him the popular sympathy of the whole quarter of the town.\n\nSorrow taking hold on a spirit so calm and strict and noble, was a\nheart-breaking spectacle. The Baroness could only tell lies, with\na woman's ingenuity, to conceal the whole dreadful truth from her\nbrother-in-law.\n\nIn the course of this miserable morning, the Marshal, who, like all old\nmen, slept but little, had extracted from Lisbeth full particulars as\nto his brother's situation, promising to marry her as the reward of her\nrevelations. Any one can imagine with what glee the old maid allowed\nthe secrets to be dragged from her which she had been dying to tell\never since she had come into the house; for by this means she made her\nmarriage more certain.\n\n\"Your brother is incorrigible!\" Lisbeth shouted into the Marshal's best\near.\n\nHer strong, clear tones enabled her to talk to him, but she wore out her\nlungs, so anxious was she to prove to her future husband that to her he\nwould never be deaf.\n\n\"He has had three mistresses,\" said the old man, \"and his wife was an\nAdeline! Poor Adeline!\"\n\n\"If you will take my advice,\" shrieked Lisbeth, \"you will use your\ninfluence with the Prince de Wissembourg to secure her some suitable\nappointment. She will need it, for the Baron's pay is pledged for three\nyears.\"\n\n\"I will go to the War Office,\" said he, \"and see the Prince, to find\nout what he thinks of my brother, and ask for his interest to help my\nsister. Think of some place that is fit for her.\"\n\n\"The charitable ladies of Paris, in concert with the Archbishop, have\nformed various beneficent associations; they employ superintendents,\nvery decently paid, whose business it is to seek out cases of real want.\nSuch an occupation would exactly suit dear Adeline; it would be work\nafter her own heart.\"\n\n\"Send to order the horses,\" said the Marshal. \"I will go and dress. I\nwill drive to Neuilly if necessary.\"\n\n\"How fond he is of her! She will always cross my path wherever I turn!\"\nsaid Lisbeth to herself.\n\nLisbeth was already supreme in the house, but not with the Marshal's\ncognizance. She had struck terror into the three servants--for she had\nallowed herself a housemaid, and she exerted her old-maidish energy in\ntaking stock of everything, examining everything, and arranging in\nevery respect for the comfort of her dear Marshal. Lisbeth, quite as\nRepublican as he could be, pleased him by her democratic opinions, and\nshe flattered him with amazing dexterity; for the last fortnight the old\nman, whose house was better kept, and who was cared for as a child by\nits mother, had begun to regard Lisbeth as a part of what he had dreamed\nof.\n\n\"My dear Marshal,\" she shouted, following him out on to the steps, \"pull\nup the windows, do not sit in a draught, to oblige me!\"\n\nThe Marshal, who had never been so cosseted in his life, went off\nsmiling at Lisbeth, though his heart was aching.\n\nAt the same hour Baron Hulot was quitting the War Office to call on his\nchief, Marshal the Prince de Wissembourg, who had sent for him. Though\nthere was nothing extraordinary in one of the Generals on the Board\nbeing sent for, Hulot's conscience was so uneasy that he fancied he saw\na cold and sinister expression in Mitouflet's face.\n\n\"Mitouflet, how is the Prince?\" he asked, locking the door of his\nprivate room and following the messenger who led the way.\n\n\"He must have a crow to pluck with you, Monsieur le Baron,\" replied the\nman, \"for his face is set at stormy.\"\n\nHulot turned pale, and said no more; he crossed the anteroom and\nreception rooms, and, with a violently beating heart, found himself at\nthe door of the Prince's private study.\n\nThe chief, at this time seventy years old, with perfectly white hair,\nand the tanned complexion of a soldier of that age, commanded attention\nby a brow so vast that imagination saw in it a field of battle. Under\nthis dome, crowned with snow, sparkled a pair of eyes, of the Napoleon\nblue, usually sad-looking and full of bitter thoughts and regrets, their\nfire overshadowed by the penthouse of the strongly projecting brow. This\nman, Bernadotte's rival, had hoped to find his seat on a throne. But\nthose eyes could flash formidable lightnings when they expressed strong\nfeelings.\n\nThen, his voice, always somewhat hollow, rang with strident tones. When\nhe was angry, the Prince was a soldier once more; he spoke the language\nof Lieutenant Cottin; he spared nothing--nobody. Hulot d'Ervy found the\nold lion, his hair shaggy like a mane, standing by the fireplace, his\nbrows knit, his back against the mantel-shelf, and his eyes apparently\nfixed on vacancy.\n\n\"Here! At your orders, Prince!\" said Hulot, affecting a graceful ease of\nmanner.\n\nThe Marshal looked hard at the Baron, without saying a word, during the\ntime it took him to come from the door to within a few steps of where\nthe chief stood. This leaden stare was like the eye of God; Hulot could\nnot meet it; he looked down in confusion.\n\n\"He knows everything!\" said he to himself.\n\n\"Does your conscience tell you nothing?\" asked the Marshal, in his deep,\nhollow tones.\n\n\"It tells me, sir, that I have been wrong, no doubt, in ordering\n_razzias_ in Algeria without referring the matter to you. At my age,\nand with my tastes, after forty-five years of service, I have\nno fortune.--You know the principles of the four hundred elect\nrepresentatives of France. Those gentlemen are envious of every\ndistinction; they have pared down even the Ministers' pay--that says\neverything! Ask them for money for an old servant!--What can you expect\nof men who pay a whole class so badly as they pay the Government legal\nofficials?--who give thirty sous a day to the laborers on the works at\nToulon, when it is a physical impossibility to live there and keep a\nfamily on less than forty sous?--who never think of the atrocity of\ngiving salaries of six hundred francs, up to a thousand or twelve\nhundred perhaps, to clerks living in Paris; and who want to secure our\nplaces for themselves as soon as the pay rises to forty thousand?--who,\nfinally, refuse to restore to the Crown a piece of Crown property\nconfiscated from the Crown in 1830--property acquired, too, by Louis\nXVI. out of his privy purse!--If you had no private fortune, Prince,\nyou would be left high and dry, like my brother, with your pay and not\nanother sou, and no thought of your having saved the army, and me with\nit, in the boggy plains of Poland.\"\n\n\"You have robbed the State! You have made yourself liable to be brought\nbefore the bench at Assizes,\" said the Marshal, \"like that clerk of the\nTreasury! And you take this, monsieur, with such levity.\"\n\n\"But there is a great difference, monseigneur!\" cried the baron. \"Have I\ndipped my hands into a cash box intrusted to my care?\"\n\n\"When a man of your rank commits such an infamous crime,\" said\nthe Marshal, \"he is doubly guilty if he does it clumsily. You have\ncompromised the honor of our official administration, which hitherto has\nbeen the purest in Europe!--And all for two hundred thousand francs and\na hussy!\" said the Marshal, in a terrible voice. \"You are a Councillor\nof State--and a private soldier who sells anything belonging to his\nregiment is punished with death! Here is a story told to me one day by\nColonel Pourin of the Second Lancers. At Saverne, one of his men fell in\nlove with a little Alsatian girl who had a fancy for a shawl. The jade\nteased this poor devil of a lancer so effectually, that though he\ncould show twenty years' service, and was about to be promoted to be\nquartermaster--the pride of the regiment--to buy this shawl he sold some\nof his company's kit.--Do you know what this lancer did, Baron d'Ervy?\nHe swallowed some window-glass after pounding it down, and died in\neleven hours, of an illness, in hospital.--Try, if you please, to die of\napoplexy, that we may not see you dishonored.\"\n\nHulot looked with haggard eyes at the old warrior; and the Prince,\nreading the look which betrayed the coward, felt a flush rise to his\ncheeks; his eyes flamed.\n\n\"Will you, sir, abandon me?\" Hulot stammered.\n\nMarshal Hulot, hearing that only his brother was with the Minister,\nventured at this juncture to come in, and, like all deaf people, went\nstraight up to the Prince.\n\n\"Oh,\" cried the hero of Poland, \"I know what you are here for, my old\nfriend! But we can do nothing.\"\n\n\"Do nothing!\" echoed Marshal Hulot, who had heard only the last word.\n\n\"Nothing; you have come to intercede for your brother. But do you know\nwhat your brother is?\"\n\n\"My brother?\" asked the deaf man.\n\n\"Yes, he is a damned infernal blackguard, and unworthy of you.\"\n\nThe Marshal in his rage shot from his eyes those fulminating fires\nwhich, like Napoleon's, broke a man's will and judgment.\n\n\"You lie, Cottin!\" said Marshal Hulot, turning white. \"Throw down your\nbaton as I throw mine! I am ready.\"\n\nThe Prince went up to his old comrade, looked him in the face, and\nshouted in his ear as he grasped his hand:\n\n\"Are you a man?\"\n\n\"You will see that I am.\"\n\n\"Well, then, pull yourself together! You must face the worst misfortune\nthat can befall you.\"\n\nThe Prince turned round, took some papers from the table, and placed\nthem in the Marshal's hands, saying, \"Read that.\"\n\nThe Comte de Forzheim read the following letter, which lay uppermost:--\n\n  \"To his Excellency the President of the Council.\n\n\"_Private and Confidential_.\n\n\"ALGIERS.\n\n  \"MY DEAR PRINCE,--We have a very ugly business on our hands, as\n  you will see by the accompanying documents.\n\n  \"The story, briefly told, is this: Baron Hulot d'Ervy sent out to\n  the province of Oran an uncle of his as a broker in grain and\n  forage, and gave him an accomplice in the person of a storekeeper.\n  This storekeeper, to curry favor, has made a confession, and\n  finally made his escape. The Public Prosecutor took the matter up\n  very thoroughly, seeing, as he supposed, that only two inferior\n  agents were implicated; but Johann Fischer, uncle to your Chief of\n  the Commissariat Department, finding that he was to be brought up\n  at the Assizes, stabbed himself in prison with a nail.\n\n  \"That would have been the end of the matter if this worthy and\n  honest man, deceived, it would seem, by his agent and by his\n  nephew, had not thought proper to write to Baron Hulot. This\n  letter, seized as a document, so greatly surprised the Public\n  Prosecutor, that he came to see me. Now, the arrest and public\n  trial of a Councillor of State would be such a terrible thing--of\n  a man high in office too, who has a good record for loyal service\n  --for after the Beresina, it was he who saved us all by\n  reorganizing the administration--that I desired to have all the\n  papers sent to me.\n\n  \"Is the matter to take its course? Now that the principal agent is\n  dead, will it not be better to smother up the affair and sentence\n  the storekeeper in default?\n\n  \"The Public Prosecutor has consented to my forwarding the\n  documents for your perusal; the Baron Hulot d'Ervy, being resident\n  in Paris, the proceedings will lie with your Supreme Court. We\n  have hit on this rather shabby way of ridding ourselves of the\n  difficulty for the moment.\n\n  \"Only, my dear Marshal, decide quickly. This miserable business is\n  too much talked about already, and it will do as much harm to us\n  as to you all if the name of the principal culprit--known at\n  present only to the Public Prosecutor, the examining judge, and\n  myself--should happen to leak out.\"\n\nAt this point the letter fell from Marshal Hulot's hands; he looked at\nhis brother; he saw that there was no need to examine the evidence. But\nhe looked for Johann Fischer's letter, and after reading it at a glance,\nheld it out to Hector:--\n\n\"FROM THE PRISON AT ORAN.\n\n  \"DEAR NEPHEW,--When you read this letter, I shall have ceased to\n  live.\n\n  \"Be quite easy, no proof can be found to incriminate you. When I\n  am dead and your Jesuit of a Chardin fled, the trial must\n  collapse. The face of our Adeline, made so happy by you, makes\n  death easy to me. Now you need not send the two hundred thousand\n  francs. Good-bye.\n\n  \"This letter will be delivered by a prisoner for a short term whom\n  I can trust, I believe.\n\n\"JOHANN FISCHER.\"\n\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Marshal Hulot to the Prince de Wissembourg\nwith pathetic pride.\n\n\"Come, come, say _tu_, not the formal _vous_,\" replied the Minister,\nclasping his old friend's hand. \"The poor lancer killed no one but\nhimself,\" he added, with a thunderous look at Hulot d'Ervy.\n\n\"How much have you had?\" said the Comte de Forzheim to his brother.\n\n\"Two hundred thousand francs.\"\n\n\"My dear friend,\" said the Count, addressing the Minister, \"you shall\nhave the two hundred thousand francs within forty-eight hours. It shall\nnever be said that a man bearing the name of Hulot has wronged the\npublic treasury of a single sou.\"\n\n\"What nonsense!\" said the Prince. \"I know where the money is, and I can\nget it back.--Send in your resignation and ask for your pension!\" he\nwent on, sending a double sheet of foolscap flying across to where the\nCouncillor of State had sat down by the table, for his legs gave way\nunder him. \"To bring you to trial would disgrace us all. I have already\nobtained from the superior Board their sanction to this line of\naction. Since you can accept life with dishonor--in my opinion the last\ndegradation--you will get the pension you have earned. Only take care to\nbe forgotten.\"\n\nThe Minister rang.\n\n\"Is Marneffe, the head-clerk, out there?\"\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Show him in!\"\n\n\"You,\" said the Minister as Marneffe came in, \"you and your wife have\nwittingly and intentionally ruined the Baron d'Ervy whom you see.\"\n\n\"Monsieur le Ministre, I beg your pardon. We are very poor. I have\nnothing to live on but my pay, and I have two children, and the one that\nis coming will have been brought into the family by Monsieur le Baron.\"\n\n\"What a villain he looks!\" said the Prince, pointing to Marneffe and\naddressing Marshal Hulot.--\"No more of Sganarelle speeches,\" he went\non; \"you will disgorge two hundred thousand francs, or be packed off to\nAlgiers.\"\n\n\"But, Monsieur le Ministre, you do not know my wife. She has spent it\nall. Monsieur le Baron asked six persons to dinner every evening.--Fifty\nthousand francs a year are spent in my house.\"\n\n\"Leave the room!\" said the Minister, in the formidable tones that\nhad given the word to charge in battle. \"You will have notice of your\ntransfer within two hours. Go!\"\n\n\"I prefer to send in my resignation,\" said Marneffe insolently. \"For it\nis too much to be what I am already, and thrashed into the bargain. That\nwould not satisfy me at all.\"\n\nAnd he left the room.\n\n\"What an impudent scoundrel!\" said the Prince.\n\nMarshal Hulot, who had stood up throughout this scene, as pale as a\ncorpse, studying his brother out of the corner of his eye, went up to\nthe Prince, and took his hand, repeating:\n\n\"In forty-eight hours the pecuniary mischief shall be repaired; but\nhonor!--Good-bye, Marshal. It is the last shot that kills. Yes, I shall\ndie of it!\" he said in his ear.\n\n\"What the devil brought you here this morning?\" said the Prince, much\nmoved.\n\n\"I came to see what can be done for his wife,\" replied the Count,\npointing to his brother. \"She is wanting bread--especially now!\"\n\n\"He has his pension.\"\n\n\"It is pledged!\"\n\n\"The Devil must possess such a man,\" said the Prince, with a shrug.\n\"What philtre do those baggages give you to rob you of your wits?\"\nhe went on to Hulot d'Ervy. \"How could you--you, who know the precise\ndetails with which in French offices everything is written down at full\nlength, consuming reams of paper to certify to the receipt or outlay\nof a few centimes--you, who have so often complained that a hundred\nsignatures are needed for a mere trifle, to discharge a soldier, to buy\na curry-comb--how could you hope to conceal a theft for any length of\ntime? To say nothing of the newspapers, and the envious, and the people\nwho would like to steal!--those women must rob you of your common-sense!\nDo they cover your eyes with walnut-shells? or are you yourself made of\ndifferent stuff from us?--You ought to have left the office as soon as\nyou found that you were no longer a man, but a temperament. If you have\ncomplicated your crime with such gross folly, you will end--I will not\nsay where----\"\n\n\"Promise me, Cottin, that you will do what you can for her,\" said the\nMarshal, who heard nothing, and was still thinking of his sister-in-law.\n\n\"Depend on me!\" said the Minister.\n\n\"Thank you, and good-bye then!--Come, monsieur,\" he said to his brother.\n\nThe Prince looked with apparent calmness at the two brothers, so\ndifferent in their demeanor, conduct, and character--the brave man\nand the coward, the ascetic and the profligate, the honest man and the\npeculator--and he said to himself:\n\n\"That mean creature will not have courage to die! And my poor Hulot,\nsuch an honest fellow! has death in his knapsack, I know!\"\n\nHe sat down again in his big chair and went on reading the despatches\nfrom Africa with a look characteristic at once of the coolness of a\nleader and of the pity roused by the sight of a battle-field! For in\nreality no one is so humane as a soldier, stern as he may seem in the\nicy determination acquired by the habit of fighting, and so absolutely\nessential in the battle-field.\n\nNext morning some of the newspapers contained, under various headings,\nthe following paragraphs:--\n\n  \"Monsieur le Baron Hulot d'Ervy has applied for his retiring\n  pension. The unsatisfactory state of the Algerian exchequer, which\n  has come out in consequence of the death and disappearance of two\n  employes, has had some share in this distinguished official's\n  decision. On hearing of the delinquencies of the agents whom he\n  had unfortunately trusted, Monsieur le Baron Hulot had a paralytic\n  stroke in the War Minister's private room.\n\n  \"Monsieur Hulot d'Ervy, brother to the Marshal Comte de Forzheim,\n  has been forty-five years in the service. His determination has\n  been vainly opposed, and is greatly regretted by all who know\n  Monsieur Hulot, whose private virtues are as conspicuous as his\n  administrative capacity. No one can have forgotten the devoted\n  conduct of the Commissary General of the Imperial Guard at Warsaw,\n  or the marvelous promptitude with which he organized supplies for\n  the various sections of the army so suddenly required by Napoleon\n  in 1815.\n\n  \"One more of the heroes of the Empire is retiring from the stage.\n  Monsieur le Baron Hulot has never ceased, since 1830, to be one of\n  the guiding lights of the State Council and of the War Office.\"\n\n  \"ALGIERS.--The case known as the forage supply case, to which some\n  of our contemporaries have given absurd prominence, has been\n  closed by the death of the chief culprit. Johann Wisch has\n  committed suicide in his cell; his accomplice, who had absconded,\n  will be sentenced in default.\n\n  \"Wisch, formerly an army contractor, was an honest man and highly\n  respected, who could not survive the idea of having been the dupe\n  of Chardin, the storekeeper who has disappeared.\"\n\nAnd in the _Paris News_ the following paragraph appeared:\n\n  \"Monsieur le Marechal the Minister of War, to prevent the\n  recurrence of such scandals for the future, has arranged for a\n  regular Commissariat office in Africa. A head-clerk in the War\n  Office, Monsieur Marneffe, is spoken of as likely to be appointed\n  to the post of director.\"\n\n\n\n  \"The office vacated by Baron Hulot is the object of much ambition.\n  The appointment is promised, it is said, to Monsieur le Comte\n  Martial de la Roche-Hugon, Deputy, brother-in-law to Monsieur le\n  Comte de Rastignac. Monsieur Massol, Master of Appeals, will fill\n  his seat on the Council of State, and Monsieur Claude Vignon\n  becomes Master of Appeals.\"\n\nOf all kinds of false gossip, the most dangerous for the Opposition\nnewspapers is the official bogus paragraph. However keen journalists\nmay be, they are sometimes the voluntary or involuntary dupes of the\ncleverness of those who have risen from the ranks of the Press, like\nClaude Vignon, to the higher realms of power. The newspaper can only be\ncircumvented by the journalist. It may be said, as a parody on a line by\nVoltaire:\n\n\"The Paris news is never what the foolish folk believe.\"\n\nMarshal Hulot drove home with his brother, who took the front seat,\nrespectfully leaving the whole of the back of the carriage to his\nsenior. The two men spoke not a word. Hector was helpless. The Marshal\nwas lost in thought, like a man who is collecting all his strength, and\nbracing himself to bear a crushing weight. On arriving at his own house,\nstill without speaking, but by an imperious gesture, he beckoned his\nbrother into his study. The Count had received from the Emperor Napoleon\na splendid pair of pistols from the Versailles factory; he took the\nbox, with its inscription. \"_Given by the Emperor Napoleon to General\nHulot_,\" out of his desk, and placing it on the top, he showed it to his\nbrother, saying, \"There is your remedy.\"\n\nLisbeth, peeping through the chink of the door, flew down to the\ncarriage and ordered the coachman to go as fast as he could gallop\nto the Rue Plumet. Within about twenty minutes she had brought back\nAdeline, whom she had told of the Marshal's threat to his brother.\n\nThe Marshal, without looking at Hector, rang the bell for his factotum,\nthe old soldier who had served him for thirty years.\n\n\"Beau-Pied,\" said he, \"fetch my notary, and Count Steinbock, and my\nniece Hortense, and the stockbroker to the Treasury. It is now half-past\nten; they must all be here by twelve. Take hackney cabs--and go faster\nthan _that_!\" he added, a republican allusion which in past days had\nbeen often on his lips. And he put on the scowl that had brought his\nsoldiers to attention when he was beating the broom on the heaths of\nBrittany in 1799. (See _Les Chouans_.)\n\n\"You shall be obeyed, Marechal,\" said Beau-Pied, with a military salute.\n\nStill paying no heed to his brother, the old man came back into his\nstudy, took a key out of his desk, and opened a little malachite box\nmounted in steel, the gift of the Emperor Alexander.\n\nBy Napoleon's orders he had gone to restore to the Russian Emperor the\nprivate property seized at the battle of Dresden, in exchange for which\nNapoleon hoped to get back Vandamme. The Czar rewarded General Hulot\nvery handsomely, giving him this casket, and saying that he hoped one\nday to show the same courtesy to the Emperor of the French; but he kept\nVandamme. The Imperial arms of Russia were displayed in gold on the lid\nof the box, which was inlaid with gold.\n\nThe Marshal counted the bank-notes it contained; he had a hundred and\nfifty-two thousand francs. He saw this with satisfaction. At the same\nmoment Madame Hulot came into the room in a state to touch the heart\nof the sternest judge. She flew into Hector's arms, looking alternately\nwith a crazy eye at the Marshal and at the case of pistols.\n\n\"What have you to say against your brother? What has my husband done to\nyou?\" said she, in such a voice that the Marshal heard her.\n\n\"He has disgraced us all!\" replied the Republican veteran, who spoke\nwith a vehemence that reopened one of his old wounds. \"He has robbed\nthe Government! He has cast odium on my name, he makes me wish I were\ndead--he has killed me!--I have only strength enough left to make\nrestitution!\n\n\"I have been abased before the Conde of the Republic, the man I esteem\nabove all others, and to whom I unjustifiably gave the lie--the Prince\nof Wissembourg!--Is that nothing? That is the score his country has\nagainst him!\"\n\nHe wiped away a tear.\n\n\"Now, as to his family,\" he went on. \"He is robbing you of the bread I\nhad saved for you, the fruit of thirty years' economy, of the privations\nof an old soldier! Here is what was intended for you,\" and he held up\nthe bank-notes. \"He has killed his Uncle Fischer, a noble and worthy son\nof Alsace who could not--as he can--endure the thought of a stain on his\npeasant's honor.\n\n\"To crown all, God, in His adorable clemency, had allowed him to choose\nan angel among women; he has had the unspeakable happiness of having\nan Adeline for his wife! And he has deceived her, he has soaked her in\nsorrows, he has neglected her for prostitutes, for street-hussies, for\nballet-girls, actresses--Cadine, Josepha, Marneffe!--And that is the\nbrother I treated as a son and made my pride!\n\n\"Go, wretched man; if you can accept the life of degradation you have\nmade for yourself, leave my house! I have not the heart to curse a\nbrother I have loved so well--I am as foolish about him as you are,\nAdeline--but never let me see him again. I forbid his attending my\nfuneral or following me to the grave. Let him show the decency of a\ncriminal if he can feel no remorse.\"\n\nThe Marshal, as pale as death, fell back on the settee, exhausted by\nhis solemn speech. And, for the first time in his life perhaps, tears\ngathered in his eyes and rolled down his cheeks.\n\n\"My poor uncle!\" cried Lisbeth, putting a handkerchief to her eyes.\n\n\"Brother!\" said Adeline, kneeling down by the Marshal, \"live for my\nsake. Help me in the task of reconciling Hector to the world and making\nhim redeem the past.\"\n\n\"He!\" cried the Marshal. \"If he lives, he is not at the end of his\ncrimes. A man who has misprized an Adeline, who has smothered in his\nown soul the feelings of a true Republican which I tried to instill into\nhim, the love of his country, of his family, and of the poor--that man\nis a monster, a swine!--Take him away if you still care for him, for a\nvoice within me cries to me to load my pistols and blow his brains out.\nBy killing him I should save you all, and I should save him too from\nhimself.\"\n\nThe old man started to his feet with such a terrifying gesture that poor\nAdeline exclaimed:\n\n\"Hector--come!\"\n\nShe seized her husband's arm, dragged him away, and out of the house;\nbut the Baron was so broken down, that she was obliged to call a coach\nto take him to the Rue Plumet, where he went to bed. The man remained\nthere for several days in a sort of half-dissolution, refusing all\nnourishment without a word. By floods of tears, Adeline persuaded him to\nswallow a little broth; she nursed him, sitting by his bed, and feeling\nonly, of all the emotions that once had filled her heart, the deepest\npity for him.\n\nAt half-past twelve, Lisbeth showed into her dear Marshal's room--for\nshe would not leave him, so much was she alarmed at the evident change\nin him--Count Steinbock and the notary.\n\n\"Monsieur le Comte,\" said the Marshal, \"I would beg you to be so good as\nto put your signature to a document authorizing my niece, your wife,\nto sell a bond for certain funds of which she at present holds only the\nreversion.--You, Mademoiselle Fischer, will agree to this sale, thus\nlosing your life interest in the securities.\"\n\n\"Yes, dear Count,\" said Lisbeth without hesitation.\n\n\"Good, my dear,\" said the old soldier. \"I hope I may live to reward you.\nBut I did not doubt you; you are a true Republican, a daughter of the\npeople.\" He took the old maid's hand and kissed it.\n\n\"Monsieur Hannequin,\" he went on, speaking to the notary, \"draw up the\nnecessary document in the form of a power of attorney, and let me have\nit within two hours, so that I may sell the stock on the Bourse to-day.\nMy niece, the Countess, holds the security; she will be here to sign the\npower of attorney when you bring it, and so will mademoiselle. Monsieur\nle Comte will be good enough to go with you and sign it at your office.\"\n\nThe artist, at a nod from Lisbeth, bowed respectfully to the Marshal and\nwent away.\n\nNext morning, at ten o'clock, the Comte de Forzheim sent in to announce\nhimself to the Prince, and was at once admitted.\n\n\"Well, my dear Hulot,\" said the Prince, holding out the newspapers to\nhis old friend, \"we have saved appearances, you see.--Read.\"\n\nMarshal Hulot laid the papers on his comrade's table, and held out to\nhim the two hundred thousand francs.\n\n\"Here is the money of which my brother robbed the State,\" said he.\n\n\"What madness!\" cried the Minister. \"It is impossible,\" he said into\nthe speaking-trumpet handed to him by the Marshal, \"to manage this\nrestitution. We should be obliged to declare your brother's dishonest\ndealings, and we have done everything to hide them.\"\n\n\"Do what you like with the money; but the family shall not owe one sou\nof its fortune to a robbery on the funds of the State,\" said the Count.\n\n\"I will take the King's commands in the matter. We will discuss it no\nfurther,\" replied the Prince, perceiving that it would be impossible to\nconquer the old man's sublime obstinacy on the point.\n\n\"Good-bye, Cottin,\" said the old soldier, taking the Prince's hand. \"I\nfeel as if my soul were frozen--\"\n\nThen, after going a step towards the door, he turned round, looked at\nthe Prince, and seeing that he was deeply moved, he opened his arms to\nclasp him in them; the two old soldiers embraced each other.\n\n\"I feel as if I were taking leave of the whole of the old army in you,\"\nsaid the Count.\n\n\"Good-bye, my good old comrade!\" said the Minister.\n\n\"Yes, it is good-bye; for I am going where all our brave men are for\nwhom we have mourned--\"\n\nJust then Claude Vignon was shown in. The two relics of the Napoleonic\nphalanx bowed gravely to each other, effacing every trace of emotion.\n\n\"You have, I hope, been satisfied by the papers,\" said the Master of\nAppeals-elect. \"I contrived to let the Opposition papers believe that\nthey were letting out our secrets.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, it is all in vain,\" replied the Minister, watching Hulot\nas he left the room. \"I have just gone through a leave-taking that has\nbeen a great grief to me. For, indeed, Marshal Hulot has not three days\nto live; I saw that plainly enough yesterday. That man, one of those\nhonest souls that are above proof, a soldier respected by the bullets\nin spite of his valor, received his death-blow--there, in that\narmchair--and dealt by my hand, in a letter!--Ring and order my\ncarriage. I must go to Neuilly,\" said he, putting the two hundred\nthousand francs into his official portfolio.\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding Lisbeth's nursing, Marshal Hulot three days later was\na dead man. Such men are the glory of the party they support. To\nRepublicans, the Marshal was the ideal of patriotism; and they all\nattended his funeral, which was followed by an immense crowd. The army,\nthe State officials, the Court, and the populace all came to do homage\nto this lofty virtue, this spotless honesty, this immaculate glory. Such\na last tribute of the people is not a thing to be had for the asking.\n\nThis funeral was distinguished by one of those tributes of delicate\nfeeling, of good taste, and sincere respect which from time to time\nremind us of the virtues and dignity of the old French nobility.\nFollowing the Marshal's bier came the old Marquis de Montauran, the\nbrother of him who, in the great rising of the Chouans in 1799, had been\nthe foe, the luckless foe, of Hulot. That Marquis, killed by the balls\nof the \"Blues,\" had confided the interests of his young brother to the\nRepublican soldier. (See _Les Chouans_.) Hulot had so faithfully acted\non the noble Royalist's verbal will, that he succeeded in saving the\nyoung man's estates, though he himself was at the time an emigre. And so\nthe homage of the old French nobility was not wanting to the leader who,\nnine years since, had conquered MADAME.\n\nThis death, happening just four days before the banns were cried for\nthe last time, came upon Lisbeth like the thunderbolt that burns the\ngarnered harvest with the barn. The peasant of Lorraine, as often\nhappens, had succeeded too well. The Marshal had died of the blows dealt\nto the family by herself and Madame Marneffe.\n\nThe old maid's vindictiveness, which success seemed to have somewhat\nmollified, was aggravated by this disappointment of her hopes. Lisbeth\nwent, crying with rage, to Madame Marneffe; for she was homeless, the\nMarshal having agreed that his lease was at any time to terminate\nwith his life. Crevel, to console Valerie's friend, took charge of her\nsavings, added to them considerably, and invested the capital in five\nper cents, giving her the life interest, and putting the securities\ninto Celestine's name. Thanks to this stroke of business, Lisbeth had an\nincome of about two thousand francs.\n\nWhen the Marshal's property was examined and valued, a note was found,\naddressed to his sister-in-law, to his niece Hortense, and to his nephew\nVictorin, desiring that they would pay among them an annuity of twelve\nhundred francs to Mademoiselle Lisbeth Fischer, who was to have been his\nwife.\n\nAdeline, seeing her husband between life and death, succeeded for some\ndays in hiding from him the fact of his brother's death; but Lisbeth\ncame, in mourning, and the terrible truth was told him eleven days after\nthe funeral.\n\nThe crushing blow revived the sick man's energies. He got up, found his\nfamily collected in the drawing-room, all in black, and suddenly silent\nas he came in. In a fortnight, Hulot, as lean as a spectre, looked to\nhis family the mere shadow of himself.\n\n\"I must decide on something,\" said he in a husky voice, as he seated\nhimself in an easy-chair, and looked round at the party, of whom Crevel\nand Steinbock were absent.\n\n\"We cannot stay here, the rent is too high,\" Hortense was saying just as\nher father came in.\n\n\"As to a home,\" said Victorin, breaking the painful silence, \"I can\noffer my mother----\"\n\nAs he heard these words, which excluded him, the Baron raised his head,\nwhich was sunk on his breast as though he were studying the pattern of\nthe carpet, though he did not even see it, and he gave the young lawyer\nan appealing look. The rights of a father are so indefeasibly sacred,\neven when he is a villain and devoid of honor, that Victorin paused.\n\n\"To your mother,\" the Baron repeated. \"You are right, my son.\"\n\n\"The rooms over ours in our wing,\" said Celestine, finishing her\nhusband's sentence.\n\n\"I am in your way, my dears?\" said the Baron, with the mildness of a man\nwho has judged himself. \"But do not be uneasy as to the future; you will\nhave no further cause for complaint of your father; you will not see him\ntill the time when you need no longer blush for him.\"\n\nHe went up to Hortense and kissed her brow. He opened his arms to his\nson, who rushed into his embrace, guessing his father's purpose. The\nBaron signed to Lisbeth, who came to him, and he kissed her forehead.\nThen he went to his room, whither Adeline followed him in an agony of\ndread.\n\n\"My brother was quite right, Adeline,\" he said, holding her hand. \"I\nam unworthy of my home life. I dared not bless my children, who have\nbehaved so nobly, but in my heart; tell them that I could only venture\nto kiss them; for the blessing of a bad man, a father who has been an\nassassin and the scourge of his family instead of its protector and its\nglory, might bring evil on them; but assure them that I shall bless them\nevery day.--As to you, God alone, for He is Almighty, can ever reward\nyou according to your merits!--I can only ask your forgiveness!\" and he\nknelt at her feet, taking her hands and wetting them with his tears.\n\n\"Hector, Hector! Your sins have been great, but Divine Mercy is\ninfinite, and you may repair all by staying with me.--Rise up in\nChristian charity, my dear--I am your wife, and not your judge. I am\nyour possession; do what you will with me; take me wherever you go, I\nfeel strong enough comfort you, to make life endurable to you, by the\nstrength of my love, my care, and respect.--Our children are settled\nin life; they need me no more. Let me try to be an amusement to you,\nan occupation. Let me share the pain of your banishment and of your\npoverty, and help to mitigate it. I could always be of some use, if it\nwere only to save the expense of a servant.\"\n\n\"Can you forgive, my dearly-beloved Adeline?\"\n\n\"Yes, only get up, my dear!\"\n\n\"Well, with that forgiveness I can live,\" said he, rising to his feet.\n\"I came back into this room that my children should not see their\nfather's humiliation. Oh! the sight constantly before their eyes of a\nfather so guilty as I am is a terrible thing; it must undermine parental\ninfluence and break every family tie. So I cannot remain among you,\nand I must go to spare you the odious spectacle of a father bereft of\ndignity. Do not oppose my departure Adeline. It would only be to load\nwith your own hand the pistol to blow my brains out. Above all, do not\nseek me in my hiding-place; you would deprive me of the only strong\nmotive remaining in me, that of remorse.\"\n\nHector's decisiveness silenced his dejected wife. Adeline, lofty in the\nmidst of all this ruin, had derived her courage from her perfect union\nwith her husband; for she had dreamed of having him for her own, of the\nbeautiful task of comforting him, of leading him back to family life,\nand reconciling him to himself.\n\n\"But, Hector, would you leave me to die of despair, anxiety, and\nalarms!\" said she, seeing herself bereft of the mainspring of her\nstrength.\n\n\"I will come back to you, dear angel--sent from Heaven expressly for me,\nI believe. I will come back, if not rich, at least with enough to live\nin ease.--Listen, my sweet Adeline, I cannot stay here for many reasons.\nIn the first place, my pension of six thousand francs is pledged for\nfour years, so I have nothing. That is not all. I shall be committed to\nprison within a few days in consequence of the bills held by Vauvinet.\nSo I must keep out of the way until my son, to whom I will give full\ninstructions, shall have bought in the bills. My disappearance will\nfacilitate that. As soon as my pension is my own, and Vauvinet is paid\noff, I will return to you.--You would be sure to let out the secret of\nmy hiding-place. Be calm; do not cry, Adeline--it is only for a month--\"\n\n\"Where will you go? What will you do? What will become of you? Who\nwill take care of you now that you are no longer young? Let me go with\nyou--we will go abroad--\" said she.\n\n\"Well, well, we will see,\" he replied.\n\nThe Baron rang and ordered Mariette to collect all his things and pack\nthem quickly and secretly. Then, after embracing his wife with a warmth\nof affection to which she was unaccustomed, he begged her to leave him\nalone for a few minutes while he wrote his instructions for Victorin,\npromising that he would not leave the house till dark, or without her.\n\nAs soon as the Baroness was in the drawing-room, the cunning old man\nstole out through the dressing-closet to the anteroom, and went away,\ngiving Mariette a slip of paper, on which was written, \"Address my\ntrunks to go by railway to Corbeil--to Monsieur Hector, cloak-room,\nCorbeil.\"\n\nThe Baron jumped into a hackney coach, and was rushing across Paris by\nthe time Mariette came to give the Baroness this note, and say that her\nmaster had gone out. Adeline flew back into her room, trembling more\nviolently than ever; her children followed on hearing her give a\npiercing cry. They found her in a dead faint; and they put her to bed,\nfor she was seized by a nervous fever which held her for a month between\nlife and death.\n\n\"Where is he?\" was the only thing she would say.\n\nVictorin sought for him in vain.\n\nAnd this is why. The Baron had driven to the Place du Palais Royal.\nThere this man, who had recovered all his wits to work out a scheme\nwhich he had premeditated during the days he had spent crushed with\npain and grief, crossed the Palais Royal on foot, and took a handsome\ncarriage from a livery-stable in the Rue Joquelet. In obedience to his\norders, the coachman went to the Rue de la Ville l'Eveque, and into the\ncourtyard of Josepha's mansion, the gates opening at once at the call\nof the driver of such a splendid vehicle. Josepha came out, prompted\nby curiosity, for her man-servant had told her that a helpless old\ngentleman, unable to get out of his carriage, begged her to come to him\nfor a moment.\n\n\"Josepha!--it is I----\"\n\nThe singer recognized her Hulot only by his voice.\n\n\"What? you, poor old man?--On my honor, you look like a twenty-franc\npiece that the Jews have sweated and the money-changers refuse.\"\n\n\"Alas, yes,\" replied Hulot; \"I am snatched from the jaws of death! But\nyou are as lovely as ever. Will you be kind?\"\n\n\"That depends,\" said she; \"everything is relative.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" said Hulot; \"can you put me up for a few days in a servant's\nroom under the roof? I have nothing--not a farthing, not a hope; no\nfood, no pension, no wife, no children, no roof over my head; without\nhonor, without courage, without a friend; and worse than all that,\nliable to imprisonment for not meeting a bill.\"\n\n\"Poor old fellow! you are without most things.--Are you also _sans\nculotte_?\"\n\n\"You laugh at me! I am done for,\" cried the Baron. \"And I counted on you\nas Gourville did on Ninon.\"\n\n\"And it was a 'real lady,' I am told who brought you to this,\" said\nJosepha. \"Those precious sluts know how to pluck a goose even better\nthan we do!--Why, you are like a corpse that the crows have done with--I\ncan see daylight through!\"\n\n\"Time is short, Josepha!\"\n\n\"Come in, old boy, I am alone, as it happens, and my people don't know\nyou. Send away your trap. Is it paid for?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Baron, getting out with the help of Josepha's arm.\n\n\"You may call yourself my father if you like,\" said the singer, moved to\npity.\n\nShe made Hulot sit down in the splendid drawing-room where he had last\nseen her.\n\n\"And is it the fact, old man,\" she went on, \"that you have killed your\nbrother and your uncle, ruined your family, mortgaged your children's\nhouse over and over again, and robbed the Government till in Africa, all\nfor your princess?\"\n\nHulot sadly bent his head.\n\n\"Well, I admire that!\" cried Josepha, starting up in her enthusiasm.\n\"It is a general flare-up! It is Sardanapalus! Splendid, thoroughly\ncomplete! I may be a hussy, but I have a soul! I tell you, I like a\nspendthrift, like you, crazy over a woman, a thousand times better than\nthose torpid, heartless bankers, who are supposed to be so good, and who\nruin no end of families with their rails--gold for them, and iron for\ntheir gulls! You have only ruined those who belong to you, you have sold\nno one but yourself; and then you have excuses, physical and moral.\"\n\nShe struck a tragic attitude, and spouted:\n\n  \"'Tis Venus whose grasp never parts from her prey.\n\nAnd there you are!\" and she pirouetted on her toe.\n\nVice, Hulot found, could forgive him; vice smiled on him from the midst\nof unbridled luxury. Here, as before a jury, the magnitude of a crime\nwas an extenuating circumstance. \"And is your lady pretty at any rate?\"\nasked Josepha, trying as a preliminary act of charity, to divert Hulot's\nthoughts, for his depression grieved her.\n\n\"On my word, almost as pretty as you are,\" said the Baron artfully.\n\n\"And monstrously droll? So I have been told. What does she do, I say? Is\nshe better fun than I am?\"\n\n\"I don't want to talk about her,\" said Hulot.\n\n\"And I hear she has come round my Crevel, and little Steinbock, and a\ngorgeous Brazilian?\"\n\n\"Very likely.\"\n\n\"And that she has got a house as good as this, that Crevel has given\nher. The baggage! She is my provost-marshal, and finishes off those I\nhave spoiled. I tell you why I am so curious to know what she is\nlike, old boy; I just caught sight of her in the Bois, in an open\ncarriage--but a long way off. She is a most accomplished harpy, Carabine\nsays. She is trying to eat up Crevel, but he only lets her nibble.\nCrevel is a knowing hand, good-natured but hard-headed, who will always\nsay Yes, and then go his own way. He is vain and passionate; but his\ncash is cold. You can never get anything out of such fellows beyond\na thousand to three thousand francs a month; they jib at any serious\noutlay, as a donkey does at a running stream.\n\n\"Not like you, old boy. You are a man of passions; you would sell your\ncountry for a woman. And, look here, I am ready to do anything for you!\nYou are my father; you started me in life; it is a sacred duty. What do\nyou want? Do you want a hundred thousand francs? I will wear myself to\na rag to gain them. As to giving you bed and board--that is nothing. A\nplace will be laid for you here every day; you can have a good room on\nthe second floor, and a hundred crowns a month for pocket-money.\"\n\nThe Baron, deeply touched by such a welcome, had a last qualm of honor.\n\n\"No, my dear child, no; I did not come here for you to keep me,\" said\nhe.\n\n\"At your age it is something to be proud of,\" said she.\n\n\"This is what I wish, my child. Your Duc d'Herouville has immense\nestates in Normandy, and I want to be his steward, under the name of\nThoul. I have the capacity, and I am honest. A man may borrow of the\nGovernment, and yet not steal from a cash-box----\"\n\n\"H'm, h'm,\" said Josepha. \"Once drunk, drinks again.\"\n\n\"In short, I only want to live out of sight for three years--\"\n\n\"Well, it is soon done,\" said Josepha. \"This evening, after dinner, I\nhave only to speak. The Duke would marry me if I wished it, but I have\nhis fortune, and I want something better--his esteem. He is a Duke of\nthe first water. He is high-minded, as noble and great as Louis XIV. and\nNapoleon rolled into one, though he is a dwarf. Besides, I have done for\nhim what la Schontz did for Rochefide; by taking my advice he has made\ntwo millions.\n\n\"Now, listen to me, old popgun. I know you; you are always after the\nwomen, and you would be dancing attendance on the Normandy girls, who\nare splendid creatures, and getting your ribs cracked by their lovers\nand fathers, and the Duke would have to get you out of the scrape. Why,\ncan't I see by the way you look at me that the _young_ man is not dead\nin you--as Fenelon put it.--No, this stewardship is not the thing for\nyou. A man cannot be off with his Paris and with us, old boy, for the\nsaying! You would die of weariness at Herouville.\"\n\n\"What is to become of me?\" said the Baron, \"for I will only stay here\ntill I see my way.\"\n\n\"Well, shall I find a pigeon-hole for you? Listen, you old pirate. Women\nare what you want. They are consolation in all circumstances. Attend\nnow.--At the end of the Alley, Rue Saint-Maur-du-Temple, there is a poor\nfamily I know of where there is a jewel of a little girl, prettier than\nI was at sixteen.--Ah! there is a twinkle in your eye already!--The\nchild works sixteen hours a day at embroidering costly pieces for the\nsilk merchants, and earns sixteen sous a day--one sou an hour!--and\nfeeds like the Irish, on potatoes fried in rats' dripping, with bread\nfive times a week--and drinks canal water out of the town pipes, because\nthe Seine water costs too much; and she cannot set up on her own account\nfor lack of six or seven thousand francs. Your wife and children bore\nyou to death, don't they?--Besides, one cannot submit to be nobody where\none has been a little Almighty. A father who has neither money nor honor\ncan only be stuffed and kept in a glass case.\"\n\nThe Baron could not help smiling at these abominable jests.\n\n\"Well, now, Bijou is to come to-morrow morning to bring me an\nembroidered wrapper, a gem! It has taken six months to make; no one\nelse will have any stuff like it! Bijou is very fond of me; I give her\ntidbits and my old gowns. And I send orders for bread and meat and wood\nto the family, who would break the shin-bones of the first comer if I\nbid them.--I try to do a little good. Ah! I know what I endured from\nhunger myself!--Bijou has confided to me all her little sorrows. There\nis the making of a super at the Ambigu-Comique in that child. Her dream\nis to wear fine dresses like mine; above all, to ride in a carriage.\nI shall say to her, 'Look here, little one, would you like to have\na friend of--' How old are you?\" she asked, interrupting herself.\n\"Seventy-two?\"\n\n\"I have given up counting.\"\n\n\"'Would you like an old gentleman of seventy-two?' I shall say. 'Very\nclean and neat, and who does not take snuff, who is as sound as a\nbell, and as good as a young man? He will marry you (in the Thirteenth\nArrondissement) and be very kind to you; he will place seven thousand\nfrancs in your account, and furnish you a room all in mahogany, and if\nyou are good, he will sometimes take you to the play. He will give you\na hundred francs a month for pocket-money, and fifty francs for\nhousekeeping.'--I know Bijou; she is myself at fourteen. I jumped for\njoy when that horrible Crevel made me his atrocious offers. Well, and\nyou, old man, will be disposed of for three years. She is a good child,\nwell behaved; for three or four years she will have her illusions--not\nfor longer.\"\n\nHulot did not hesitate; he had made up his mind to refuse; but to\nseem grateful to the kind-hearted singer, who was benevolent after her\nlights, he affected to hesitate between vice and virtue.\n\n\"Why, you are as cold as a paving-stone in winter!\" she exclaimed in\namazement. \"Come, now. You will make a whole family happy--a grandfather\nwho runs all the errands, a mother who is being worn out with work,\nand two sisters--one of them very plain--who make thirty-two sous a day\nwhile putting their eyes out. It will make up for the misery you have\ncaused at home, and you will expiate your sin while you are having as\nmuch fun as a minx at Mabille.\"\n\nHulot, to put an end to this temptation, moved his fingers as if he were\ncounting out money.\n\n\"Oh! be quite easy as to ways and means,\" replied Josepha. \"My Duke will\nlend you ten thousand francs; seven thousand to start an embroidery\nshop in Bijou's name, and three thousand for furnishing; and every three\nmonths you will find a cheque here for six hundred and fifty francs.\nWhen you get your pension paid you, you can repay the seventeen thousand\nfrancs. Meanwhile you will be as happy as a cow in clover, and hidden in\na hole where the police will never find you. You must wear a loose serge\ncoat, and you will look like a comfortable householder. Call yourself\nThoul, if that is your fancy. I will tell Bijou that you are an uncle\nof mine come from Germany, having failed in business, and you will be\ncosseted like a divinity.--There now, Daddy!--And who knows! you may\nhave no regrets. In case you should be bored, keep one Sunday rig-out,\nand you can come and ask me for a dinner and spend the evening here.\"\n\n\"I!--and I meant to settle down and behave myself!--Look here, borrow\ntwenty thousand francs for me, and I will set out to make my fortune in\nAmerica, like my friend d'Aiglemont when Nucingen cleaned him out.\"\n\n\"You!\" cried Josepha. \"Nay, leave morals to work-a-day folks, to raw\nrecruits, to the _worrrthy_ citizens who have nothing to boast of\nbut their virtue. You! You were born to be something better than a\nnincompoop; you are as a man what I am as a woman--a spendthrift of\ngenius.\"\n\n\"We will sleep on it and discuss it all to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"You will dine with the Duke. My d'Herouville will receive you as\ncivilly as if you were the saviour of the State; and to-morrow you can\ndecide. Come, be jolly, old boy! Life is a garment; when it is dirty, we\nmust brush it; when it is ragged, it must be patched; but we keep it on\nas long as we can.\"\n\nThis philosophy of life, and her high spirits, postponed Hulot's keenest\npangs.\n\nAt noon next day, after a capital breakfast, Hulot saw the arrival of\none of those living masterpieces which Paris alone of all the cities in\nthe world can produce, by means of the constant concubinage of luxury\nand poverty, of vice and decent honesty, of suppressed desire and\nrenewed temptation, which makes the French capital the daughter of\nNinevah, of Babylon, and of Imperial Rome.\n\nMademoiselle Olympe Bijou, a child of sixteen, had the exquisite face\nwhich Raphael drew for his Virgins; eyes of pathetic innocence, weary\nwith overwork--black eyes, with long lashes, their moisture parched with\nthe heat of laborious nights, and darkened with fatigue; a complexion\nlike porcelain, almost too delicate; a mouth like a partly opened\npomegranate; a heaving bosom, a full figure, pretty hands, the whitest\nteeth, and a mass of black hair; and the whole meagrely set off by a\ncotton frock at seventy-five centimes the metre, leather shoes without\nheels, and the cheapest gloves. The girl, all unconscious of her charms,\nhad put on her best frock to wait on the fine lady.\n\nThe Baron, gripped again by the clutch of profligacy, felt all his\nlife concentrated in his eyes. He forgot everything on beholding this\ndelightful creature. He was like a sportsman in sight of the game; if an\nemperor were present, he must take aim!\n\n\"And warranted sound,\" said Josepha in his ear. \"An honest child, and\nwanting bread. This is Paris--I have been there!\"\n\n\"It is a bargain,\" replied the old man, getting up and rubbing his\nhands.\n\nWhen Olympe Bijou was gone, Josepha looked mischievously at the Baron.\n\n\"If you want things to keep straight, Daddy,\" said she, \"be as firm\nas the Public Prosecutor on the bench. Keep a tight hand on her, be a\nBartholo! Ware Auguste, Hippolyte, Nestor, Victor--_or_, that is gold,\nin every form. When once the child is fed and dressed, if she gets the\nupper hand, she will drive you like a serf.--I will see to settling\nyou comfortably. The Duke does the handsome; he will lend--that is,\ngive--you ten thousand francs; and he deposits eight thousand with his\nnotary, who will pay you six hundred francs every quarter, for I cannot\ntrust you.--Now, am I nice?\"\n\n\"Adorable.\"\n\nTen days after deserting his family, when they were gathered round\nAdeline, who seemed to be dying, as she said again and again, in a weak\nvoice, \"Where is he?\" Hector, under the name of Thoul, was established\nin the Rue Saint-Maur, at the head of a business as embroiderer, under\nthe name of Thoul and Bijou.\n\n\n\nVictorin Hulot, under the overwhelming disasters of his family, had\nreceived the finishing touch which makes or mars the man. He was\nperfection. In the great storms of life we act like the captain of a\nship who, under the stress of a hurricane, lightens the ship of its\nheaviest cargo. The young lawyer lost his self-conscious pride, his\ntoo evident assertiveness, his arrogance as an orator and his political\npretensions. He was as a man what his wife was as a woman. He made\nup his mind to make the best of his Celestine--who certainly did not\nrealize his dreams--and was wise enough to estimate life at its true\nvalue by contenting himself in all things with the second best. He\nvowed to fulfil his duties, so much had he been shocked by his father's\nexample.\n\nThese feelings were confirmed as he stood by his mother's bed on the day\nwhen she was out of danger. Nor did this happiness come single. Claude\nVignon, who called every day from the Prince de Wissembourg to inquire\nas to Madame Hulot's progress, desired the re-elected deputy to go with\nhim to see the Minister.\n\n\"His Excellency,\" said he, \"wants to talk over your family affairs with\nyou.\"\n\nThe Prince had long known Victorin Hulot, and received him with a\nfriendliness that promised well.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said the old soldier, \"I promised your uncle, in this\nroom, that I would take care of your mother. That saintly woman, I\nam told, is getting well again; now is the time to pour oil into your\nwounds. I have for you here two hundred thousand francs; I will give\nthem to you----\"\n\nThe lawyer's gesture was worthy of his uncle the Marshal.\n\n\"Be quite easy,\" said the Prince, smiling; \"it is money in trust. My\ndays are numbered; I shall not always be here; so take this sum, and\nfill my place towards your family. You may use this money to pay off\nthe mortgage on your house. These two hundred thousand francs are the\nproperty of your mother and your sister. If I gave the money to Madame\nHulot, I fear that, in her devotion to her husband, she would be tempted\nto waste it. And the intention of those who restore it to you is, that\nit should produce bread for Madame Hulot and her daughter, the Countess\nSteinbock. You are a steady man, the worthy son of your noble mother,\nthe true nephew of my friend the Marshal; you are appreciated here, you\nsee--and elsewhere. So be the guardian angel of your family, and take\nthis as a legacy from your uncle and me.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" said Hulot, taking the Minister's hand and pressing it,\n\"such men as you know that thanks in words mean nothing; gratitude must\nbe proven.\"\n\n\"Prove yours--\" said the old man.\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"By accepting what I have to offer you,\" said the Minister. \"We propose\nto appoint you to be attorney to the War Office, which just now is\ninvolved in litigations in consequence of the plan for fortifying Paris;\nconsulting clerk also to the Prefecture of Police; and a member of\nthe Board of the Civil List. These three appointments will secure you\nsalaries amounting to eighteen thousand francs, and will leave you\npolitically free. You can vote in the Chamber in obedience to your\nopinions and your conscience. Act in perfect freedom on that score. It\nwould be a bad thing for us if there were no national opposition!\n\n\"Also, a few lines from your uncle, written a day or two before he\nbreathed his last, suggested what I could do for your mother, whom\nhe loved very truly.--Mesdames Popinot, de Rastignac, de Navarreins,\nd'Espard, de Grandlieu, de Carigliano, de Lenoncourt, and de la Batie\nhave made a place for your mother as a Lady Superintendent of their\ncharities. These ladies, presidents of various branches of benevolent\nwork, cannot do everything themselves; they need a lady of character\nwho can act for them by going to see the objects of their beneficence,\nascertaining that charity is not imposed upon, and whether the help\ngiven really reaches those who applied for it, finding out that the poor\nwho are ashamed to beg, and so forth. Your mother will fulfil an\nangelic function; she will be thrown in with none but priests and these\ncharitable ladies; she will be paid six thousand francs and the cost of\nher hackney coaches.\n\n\"You see, young man, that a pure and nobly virtuous man can still assist\nhis family, even from the grave. Such a name as your uncle's is, and\nought to be, a buckler against misfortune in a well-organized scheme of\nsociety. Follow in his path; you have started in it, I know; continue in\nit.\"\n\n\"Such delicate kindness cannot surprise me in my mother's friend,\" said\nVictorin. \"I will try to come up to all your hopes.\"\n\n\"Go at once, and take comfort to your family.--By the way,\" added the\nPrince, as he shook hands with Victorin, \"your father has disappeared?\"\n\n\"Alas! yes.\"\n\n\"So much the better. That unhappy man has shown his wit, in which,\nindeed, he is not lacking.\"\n\n\"There are bills of his to be met.\"\n\n\"Well, you shall have six months' pay of your three appointments in\nadvance. This pre-payment will help you, perhaps, to get the notes out\nof the hands of the money-lender. And I will see Nucingen, and perhaps\nmay succeed in releasing your father's pension, pledged to him, without\nits costing you or our office a sou. The peer has not killed the banker\nin Nucingen; he is insatiable; he wants some concession.--I know not\nwhat----\"\n\nSo on his return to the Rue Plumet, Victorin could carry out his plan of\nlodging his mother and sister under his roof.\n\nThe young lawyer, already famous, had, for his sole fortune, one of the\nhandsomest houses in Paris, purchased in 1834 in preparation for his\nmarriage, situated on the boulevard between the Rue de la Paix and\nthe Rue Louis-le-Grand. A speculator had built two houses between\nthe boulevard and the street; and between these, with the gardens\nand courtyards to the front and back, there remained still standing a\nsplendid wing, the remains of the magnificent mansion of the Verneuils.\nThe younger Hulot had purchased this fine property, on the strength of\nMademoiselle Crevel's marriage-portion, for one million francs, when it\nwas put up to auction, paying five hundred thousand down. He lived on\nthe ground floor, expecting to pay the remainder out of letting the\nrest; but though it is safe to speculate in house-property in Paris,\nsuch investments are capricious or hang fire, depending on unforeseen\ncircumstances.\n\nAs the Parisian lounger may have observed, the boulevard between the Rue\nde la Paix and the Rue Louis-le-Grand prospered but slowly; it took\nso long to furbish and beautify itself, that trade did not set up its\ndisplay there till 1840--the gold of the money-changers, the fairy-work\nof fashion, and the luxurious splendor of shop-fronts.\n\nIn spite of two hundred thousand francs given by Crevel to his daughter\nat the time when his vanity was flattered by this marriage, before the\nBaron had robbed him of Josepha; in spite of the two hundred thousand\nfrancs paid off by Victorin in the course of seven years, the property\nwas still burdened with a debt of five hundred thousand francs, in\nconsequence of Victorin's devotion to his father. Happily, a rise in\nrents and the advantages of the situation had at this time improved the\nvalue of the houses. The speculation was justifying itself after eight\nyears' patience, during which the lawyer had strained every nerve to pay\nthe interest and some trifling amounts of the capital borrowed.\n\nThe tradespeople were ready to offer good rents for the shops, on\ncondition of being granted leases for eighteen years. The dwelling\napartments rose in value by the shifting of the centre in Paris\nlife--henceforth transferred to the region between the Bourse and the\nMadeleine, now the seat of the political power and financial authority\nin Paris. The money paid to him by the Minister, added to a year's rent\nin advance and the premiums paid by his tenants, would finally reduce\nthe outstanding debt to two hundred thousand francs. The two houses, if\nentirely let, would bring in a hundred thousand francs a year. Within\ntwo years more, during which the Hulots could live on his salaries,\nadded to by the Marshal's investments, Victorin would be in a splendid\nposition.\n\nThis was manna from heaven. Victorin could give up the first floor of\nhis own house to his mother, and the second to Hortense, excepting two\nrooms reserved for Lisbeth. With Cousin Betty as the housekeeper, this\ncompound household could bear all these charges, and yet keep up a\ngood appearance, as beseemed a pleader of note. The great stars of the\nlaw-courts were rapidly disappearing; and Victorin Hulot, gifted with\na shrewd tongue and strict honesty, was listened to by the Bench and\nCouncillors; he studied his cases thoroughly, and advanced nothing that\nhe could not prove. He would not hold every brief that offered; in fact,\nhe was a credit to the bar.\n\nThe Baroness' home in the Rue Plumet had become so odious to her, that\nshe allowed herself to be taken to the Rue Louis-le-Grand. Thus, by her\nson's care, Adeline occupied a fine apartment; she was spared all the\ndaily worries of life; for Lisbeth consented to begin again, working\nwonders of domestic economy, such as she had achieved for Madame\nMarneffe, seeing here a way of exerting her silent vengeance on those\nthree noble lives, the object, each, of her hatred, which was kept\ngrowing by the overthrow of all her hopes.\n\nOnce a month she went to see Valerie, sent, indeed, by Hortense, who\nwanted news of Wenceslas, and by Celestine, who was seriously uneasy\nat the acknowledged and well-known connection between her father and a\nwoman to whom her mother-in-law and sister-in-law owed their ruin and\ntheir sorrows. As may be supposed, Lisbeth took advantage of this to see\nValerie as often as possible.\n\n\n\nThus, about twenty months passed by, during which the Baroness recovered\nher health, though her palsied trembling never left her. She made\nherself familiar with her duties, which afforded her a noble distraction\nfrom her sorrow and constant food for the divine goodness of her heart.\nShe also regarded it as an opportunity for finding her husband in the\ncourse of one of those expeditions which took her into every part of\nParis.\n\nDuring this time, Vauvinet had been paid, and the pension of six\nthousand francs was almost redeemed. Victorin could maintain his mother\nas well as Hortense out of the ten thousand francs interest on the money\nleft by Marshal Hulot in trust for them. Adeline's salary amounted to\nsix thousand francs a year; and this, added to the Baron's pension when\nit was freed, would presently secure an income of twelve thousand francs\na year to the mother and daughter.\n\nThus, the poor woman would have been almost happy but for her perpetual\nanxieties as to the Baron's fate; for she longed to have him with her to\nshare the improved fortunes that smiled on the family; and but for\nthe constant sight of her forsaken daughter; and but for the terrible\nthrusts constantly and _unconsciously_ dealt her by Lisbeth, whose\ndiabolical character had free course.\n\nA scene which took place at the beginning of the month of March 1843\nwill show the results of Lisbeth's latent and persistent hatred, still\nseconded, as she always was, by Madame Marneffe.\n\nTwo great events had occurred in the Marneffe household. In the first\nplace, Valerie had given birth to a still-born child, whose little\ncoffin had cost her two thousand francs a year. And then, as to Marneffe\nhimself, eleven months since, this is the report given by Lisbeth to\nthe Hulot family one day on her return from a visit of discovery at the\nhotel Marneffe.\n\n\"This morning,\" said she, \"that dreadful Valerie sent for Doctor\nBianchon to ask whether the medical men who had condemned her husband\nyesterday had made no mistake. Bianchon pronounced that to-night at the\nlatest that horrible creature will depart to the torments that await\nhim. Old Crevel and Madame Marneffe saw the doctor out; and your father,\nmy dear Celestine, gave him five gold pieces for his good news.\n\n\"When he came back into the drawing-room, Crevel cut capers like a\ndancer; he embraced that woman, exclaiming, 'Then, at last, you will\nbe Madame Crevel!'--And to me, when she had gone back to her husband's\nbedside, for he was at his last gasp, your noble father said to me,\n'With Valerie as my wife, I can become a peer of France! I shall buy an\nestate I have my eye on--Presles, which Madame de Serizy wants to\nsell. I shall be Crevel de Presles, member of the Common Council of\nSeine-et-Oise, and Deputy. I shall have a son! I shall be everything\nI have ever wished to be.'--'Heh!' said I, 'and what about your\ndaughter?'--'Bah!' says he, 'she is only a woman! And she is quite too\nmuch of a Hulot. Valerie has a horror of them all.--My son-in-law has\nnever chosen to come to this house; why has he given himself such airs\nas a Mentor, a Spartan, a Puritan, a philanthropist? Besides, I have\nsquared accounts with my daughter; she has had all her mother's fortune,\nand two hundred thousand francs to that. So I am free to act as I\nplease.--I shall judge of my son-in-law and Celestine by their conduct\non my marriage; as they behave, so shall I. If they are nice to their\nstepmother, I will receive them. I am a man, after all!'--In short, all\nthis rhodomontade! And an attitude like Napoleon on the column.\"\n\nThe ten months' widowhood insisted on by the law had now elapsed some\nfew days since. The estate of Presles was purchased. Victorin and\nCelestine had that very morning sent Lisbeth to make inquiries as to the\nmarriage of the fascinating widow to the Mayor of Paris, now a member of\nthe Common Council of the Department of Seine-et-Oise.\n\nCelestine and Hortense, in whom the ties of affection had been\ndrawn closer since they had lived under the same roof, were almost\ninseparable. The Baroness, carried away by a sense of honesty which led\nher to exaggerate the duties of her place, devoted herself to the work\nof charity of which she was the agent; she was out almost every day\nfrom eleven till five. The sisters-in-law, united in their cares for\nthe children whom they kept together, sat at home and worked. They had\narrived at the intimacy which thinks aloud, and were a touching picture\nof two sisters, one cheerful and the other sad. The less happy of the\ntwo, handsome, lively, high-spirited, and clever, seemed by her manner\nto defy her painful situation; while the melancholy Celestine, sweet and\ncalm, and as equable as reason itself, might have been supposed to have\nsome secret grief. It was this contradiction, perhaps, that added to\ntheir warm friendship. Each supplied the other with what she lacked.\n\nSeated in a little summer-house in the garden, which the speculator's\ntrowel had spared by some fancy of the builder's, who believed that he\nwas preserving these hundred feet square of earth for his own pleasure,\nthey were admiring the first green shoots of the lilac-trees, a\nspring festival which can only be fully appreciated in Paris when the\ninhabitants have lived for six months oblivious of what vegetation\nmeans, among the cliffs of stone where the ocean of humanity tosses to\nand fro.\n\n\"Celestine,\" said Hortense to her sister-in-law, who had complained that\nin such fine weather her husband should be kept at the Chamber, \"I think\nyou do not fully appreciate your happiness. Victorin is a perfect angel,\nand you sometimes torment him.\"\n\n\"My dear, men like to be tormented! Certain ways of teasing are a\nproof of affection. If your poor mother had only been--I will not say\nexacting, but always prepared to be exacting, you would not have had so\nmuch to grieve over.\"\n\n\"Lisbeth is not come back. I shall have to sing the song\nof _Malbrouck_,\" said Hortense. \"I do long for some news of\nWenceslas!--What does he live on? He has not done a thing these two\nyears.\"\n\n\"Victorin saw him, he told me, with that horrible woman not long ago;\nand he fancied that she maintains him in idleness.--If you only would,\ndear soul, you might bring your husband back to you yet.\"\n\nHortense shook her head.\n\n\"Believe me,\" Celestine went on, \"the position will ere long be\nintolerable. In the first instance, rage, despair, indignation, gave you\nstrength. The awful disasters that have come upon us since--two deaths,\nruin, and the disappearance of Baron Hulot--have occupied your mind and\nheart; but now you live in peace and silence, you will find it hard to\nbear the void in your life; and as you cannot, and will never leave the\npath of virtue, you will have to be reconciled to Wenceslas. Victorin,\nwho loves you so much, is of that opinion. There is something stronger\nthan one's feelings even, and that is Nature!\"\n\n\"But such a mean creature!\" cried the proud Hortense. \"He cares for\nthat woman because she feeds him.--And has she paid his debts, do you\nsuppose?--Good Heaven! I think of that man's position day and night! He\nis the father of my child, and he is degrading himself.\"\n\n\"But look at your mother, my dear,\" said Celestine.\n\nCelestine was one of those women who, when you have given them reasons\nenough to convince a Breton peasant, still go back for the hundredth\ntime to their original argument. The character of her face, somewhat\nflat, dull, and common, her light-brown hair in stiff, neat bands, her\nvery complexion spoke of a sensible woman, devoid of charm, but also\ndevoid of weakness.\n\n\"The Baroness would willingly go to join her husband in his disgrace,\nto comfort him and hide him in her heart from every eye,\" Celestine went\non. \"Why, she has a room made ready upstairs for Monsieur Hulot, as if\nshe expected to find him and bring him home from one day to the next.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, my mother is sublime!\" replied Hortense. \"She has been so every\nminute of every day for six-and-twenty years; but I am not like her, it\nis not my nature.--How can I help it? I am angry with myself sometimes;\nbut you do not know, Celestine, what it would be to make terms with\ninfamy.\"\n\n\"There is my father!\" said Celestine placidly. \"He has certainly started\non the road that ruined yours. He is ten years younger than the Baron,\nto be sure, and was only a tradesman; but how can it end? This Madame\nMarneffe has made a slave of my father; he is her dog; she is mistress\nof his fortune and his opinions, and nothing can open his eyes. I\ntremble when I remember that their banns of marriage are already\npublished!--My husband means to make a last attempt; he thinks it a duty\nto try to avenge society and the family, and bring that woman to account\nfor all her crimes. Alas! my dear Hortense, such lofty souls as Victorin\nand hearts like ours come too late to a comprehension of the world and\nits ways!--This is a secret, dear, and I have told you because you are\ninterested in it, but never by a word or a look betray it to Lisbeth, or\nyour mother, or anybody, for--\"\n\n\"Here is Lisbeth!\" said Hortense. \"Well, cousin, and how is the Inferno\nof the Rue Barbet going on?\"\n\n\"Badly for you, my children.--Your husband, my dear Hortense, is more\ncrazy about that woman than ever, and she, I must own, is madly in love\nwith him.--Your father, dear Celestine, is gloriously blind. That, to\nbe sure, is nothing; I have had occasion to see it once a fortnight;\nreally, I am lucky never to have had anything to do with men, they are\nbesotted creatures.--Five days hence you, dear child, and Victorin will\nhave lost your father's fortune.\"\n\n\"Then the banns are cried?\" said Celestine.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lisbeth, \"and I have just been arguing your case. I pointed\nout to that monster, who is going the way of the other, that if he\nwould only get you out of the difficulties you are in by paying off the\nmortgage on the house, you would show your gratitude and receive your\nstepmother--\"\n\nHortense started in horror.\n\n\"Victorin will see about that,\" said Celestine coldly.\n\n\"But do you know what Monsieur le Maire's answer was?\" said Lisbeth. \"'I\nmean to leave them where they are. Horses can only be broken in by lack\nof food, sleep, and sugar.'--Why, Baron Hulot was not so bad as Monsieur\nCrevel.\n\n\"So, my poor dears, you may say good-bye to the money. And such a fine\nfortune! Your father paid three million francs for the Presles estate,\nand he has thirty thousand francs a year in stocks! Oh!--he has no\nsecrets from me. He talks of buying the Hotel de Navarreins, in the\nRue du Bac. Madame Marneffe herself has forty thousand francs a\nyear.--Ah!--here is our guardian angel, here comes your mother!\" she\nexclaimed, hearing the rumble of wheels.\n\nAnd presently the Baroness came down the garden steps and joined the\nparty. At fifty-five, though crushed by so many troubles, and constantly\ntrembling as if shivering with ague, Adeline, whose face was indeed\npale and wrinkled, still had a fine figure, a noble outline, and natural\ndignity. Those who saw her said, \"She must have been beautiful!\" Worn\nwith the grief of not knowing her husband's fate, of being unable\nto share with him this oasis in the heart of Paris, this peace and\nseclusion and the better fortune that was dawning on the family, her\nbeauty was the beauty of a ruin. As each gleam of hope died out, each\nday of search proved vain, Adeline sank into fits of deep melancholy\nthat drove her children to despair.\n\nThe Baroness had gone out that morning with fresh hopes, and was\nanxiously expected. An official, who was under obligations to Hulot, to\nwhom he owed his position and advancement, declared that he had seen\nthe Baron in a box at the Ambigu-Comique theatre with a woman of\nextraordinary beauty. So Adeline had gone to call on the Baron Verneuil.\nThis important personage, while asserting that he had positively seen\nhis old patron, and that his behaviour to the woman indicated an illicit\nestablishment, told Madame Hulot that to avoid meeting him the Baron had\nleft long before the end of the play.\n\n\"He looked like a man at home with the damsel, but his dress betrayed\nsome lack of means,\" said he in conclusion.\n\n\"Well?\" said the three women as the Baroness came towards them.\n\n\"Well, Monsieur Hulot is in Paris; and to me,\" said Adeline, \"it is a\ngleam of happiness only to know that he is within reach of us.\"\n\n\"But he does not seem to have mended his ways,\" Lisbeth remarked when\nAdeline had finished her report of her visit to Baron Verneuil. \"He has\ntaken up some little work-girl. But where can he get the money from?\nI could bet that he begs of his former mistresses--Mademoiselle Jenny\nCadine or Josepha.\"\n\nThe Baroness trembled more severely than ever; every nerve quivered; she\nwiped away the tears that rose to her eyes and looked mournfully up to\nheaven.\n\n\"I cannot think that a Grand Commander of the Legion of Honor will have\nfallen so low,\" said she.\n\n\"For his pleasure what would he not do?\" said Lisbeth. \"He robbed the\nState, he will rob private persons, commit murder--who knows?\"\n\n\"Oh, Lisbeth!\" cried the Baroness, \"keep such thoughts to yourself.\"\n\nAt this moment Louise came up to the family group, now increased by the\narrival of the two Hulot children and little Wenceslas to see if their\ngrandmother's pockets did not contain some sweetmeats.\n\n\"What is it, Louise?\" asked one and another.\n\n\"A man who wants to see Mademoiselle Fischer.\"\n\n\"Who is the man?\" asked Lisbeth.\n\n\"He is in rags, mademoiselle, and covered with flue like a\nmattress-picker; his nose is red, and he smells of brandy.--He is one of\nthose men who work half of the week at most.\"\n\nThis uninviting picture had the effect of making Lisbeth hurry into the\ncourtyard of the house in the Rue Louis-le-Grand, where she found a man\nsmoking a pipe colored in a style that showed him an artist in tobacco.\n\n\"Why have you come here, Pere Chardin?\" she asked. \"It is understood\nthat you go, on the first Saturday in every month, to the gate of the\nHotel Marneffe, Rue Barbet-de-Jouy. I have just come back after waiting\nthere for five hours, and you did not come.\"\n\n\"I did go there, good and charitable lady!\" replied the mattress-picker.\n\"But there was a game at pool going on at the Cafe des Savants, Rue du\nCerf-Volant, and every man has his fancy. Now, mine is billiards. If it\nwasn't for billiards, I might be eating off silver plate. For, I tell\nyou this,\" and he fumbled for a scrap of paper in his ragged trousers\npocket, \"it is billiards that leads on to a dram and plum-brandy.--It\nis ruinous, like all fine things, in the things it leads to. I know\nyour orders, but the old 'un is in such a quandary that I came on to\nforbidden grounds.--If the hair was all hair, we might sleep sound on\nit; but it is mixed. God is not for all, as the saying goes. He has\nHis favorites--well, He has the right. Now, here is the writing of your\nestimable relative and my very good friend--his political opinion.\"\n\nChardin attempted to trace some zigzag lines in the air with the\nforefinger of his right hand.\n\nLisbeth, not listening to him, read these few words:\n\n  \"DEAR COUSIN,--Be my Providence; give me three hundred francs this\n  day.\n\n\"HECTOR.\"\n\n\n\"What does he want so much money for?\"\n\n\"The lan'lord!\" said Chardin, still trying to sketch arabesques. \"And\nthen my son, you see, has come back from Algiers through Spain and\nBayonee, and, and--he has _found_ nothing--against his rule, for a sharp\ncove is my son, saving your presence. How can he help it, he is in want\nof food; but he will repay all we lend him, for he is going to get up a\ncompany. He has ideas, he has, that will carry him--\"\n\n\"To the police court,\" Lisbeth put in. \"He murdered my uncle; I shall\nnot forget that.\"\n\n\"He--why, he could not bleed a chicken, honorable lady.\"\n\n\"Here are the three hundred francs,\" said Lisbeth, taking fifteen gold\npieces out of her purse. \"Now, go, and never come here again.\"\n\nShe saw the father of the Oran storekeeper off the premises, and pointed\nout the drunken old creature to the porter.\n\n\"At any time when that man comes here, if by chance he should come\nagain, do not let him in. If he should ask whether Monsieur Hulot junior\nor Madame la Baronne Hulot lives here, tell him you know of no such\npersons.\"\n\n\"Very good, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Your place depends on it if you make any mistake, even without\nintending it,\" said Lisbeth, in the woman's ear.--\"Cousin,\" she went on\nto Victorin, who just now came in, \"a great misfortune is hanging over\nyour head.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" said Victorin.\n\n\"Within a few days Madame Marneffe will be your wife's stepmother.\"\n\n\"That remains to be seen,\" replied Victorin.\n\nFor six months past Lisbeth had very regularly paid a little allowance\nto Baron Hulot, her former protector, whom she now protected; she knew\nthe secret of his dwelling-place, and relished Adeline's tears, saying\nto her, as we have seen, when she saw her cheerful and hopeful, \"You may\nexpect to find my poor cousin's name in the papers some day under the\nheading 'Police Report.'\"\n\nBut in this, as on a former occasion, she let her vengeance carry her\ntoo far. She had aroused the prudent suspicions of Victorin. He had\nresolved to be rid of this Damocles' sword so constantly flourished\nover them by Lisbeth, and of the female demon to whom his mother and the\nfamily owed so many woes. The Prince de Wissembourg, knowing all\nabout Madame Marneffe's conduct, approved of the young lawyer's secret\nproject; he had promised him, as a President of the Council can promise,\nthe secret assistance of the police, to enlighten Crevel and rescue\na fine fortune from the clutches of the diabolical courtesan, whom he\ncould not forgive either for causing the death of Marshal Hulot or for\nthe Baron's utter ruin.\n\n\n\nThe words spoken by Lisbeth, \"He begs of his former mistresses,\" haunted\nthe Baroness all night. Like sick men given over by the physicians,\nwho have recourse to quacks, like men who have fallen into the lowest\nDantesque circle of despair, or drowning creatures who mistake a\nfloating stick for a hawser, she ended by believing in the baseness of\nwhich the mere idea had horrified her; and it occurred to her that she\nmight apply for help to one of those terrible women.\n\nNext morning, without consulting her children or saying a word to\nanybody, she went to see Mademoiselle Josepha Mirah, prima donna of the\nRoyal Academy of Music, to find or to lose the hope that had gleamed\nbefore her like a will-o'-the-wisp. At midday, the great singer's\nwaiting-maid brought her in the card of the Baronne Hulot, saying that\nthis person was waiting at the door, having asked whether Mademoiselle\ncould receive her.\n\n\"Are the rooms done?\"\n\n\"Yes, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"And the flowers fresh?\"\n\n\"Yes, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Just tell Jean to look round and see that everything is as it should be\nbefore showing the lady in, and treat her with the greatest respect. Go,\nand come back to dress me--I must look my very best.\"\n\nShe went to study herself in the long glass.\n\n\"Now, to put our best foot foremost!\" said she to herself. \"Vice under\narms to meet virtue!--Poor woman, what can she want of me? I cannot bear\nto see.\n\n    \"The noble victim of outrageous fortune!\"\n\nAnd she sang through the famous aria as the maid came in again.\n\n\"Madame,\" said the girl, \"the lady has a nervous trembling--\"\n\n\"Offer her some orange-water, some rum, some broth--\"\n\n\"I did, mademoiselle; but she declines everything, and says it is an\ninfirmity, a nervous complaint--\"\n\n\"Where is she?\"\n\n\"In the big drawing-room.\"\n\n\"Well, make haste, child. Give me my smartest slippers, the\ndressing-gown embroidered by Bijou, and no end of lace frills. Do my\nhair in a way to astonish a woman.--This woman plays a part against\nmine; and tell the lady--for she is a real, great lady, my girl, nay,\nmore, she is what you will never be, a woman whose prayers can rescue\nsouls from your purgatory--tell her I was in bed, as I was playing last\nnight, and that I am just getting up.\"\n\nThe Baroness, shown into Josepha's handsome drawing-room, did not note\nhow long she was kept waiting there, though it was a long half hour.\nThis room, entirely redecorated even since Josepha had had the house,\nwas hung with silk in purple and gold color. The luxury which fine\ngentlemen were wont to lavish on their _petites maisons_, the scenes of\ntheir profligacy, of which the remains still bear witness to the follies\nfrom which they were so aptly named, was displayed to perfection, thanks\nto modern inventiveness, in the four rooms opening into each other,\nwhere the warm temperature was maintained by a system of hot-air pipes\nwith invisible openings.\n\nThe Baroness, quite bewildered, examined each work of art with the\ngreatest amazement. Here she found fortunes accounted for that melt in\nthe crucible under which pleasure and vanity feed the devouring flames.\nThis woman, who for twenty-six years had lived among the dead relics of\nimperial magnificence, whose eyes were accustomed to carpets patterned\nwith faded flowers, rubbed gilding, silks as forlorn as her heart, half\nunderstood the powerful fascinations of vice as she studied its results.\nIt was impossible not to wish to possess these beautiful things, these\nadmirable works of art, the creation of the unknown talent which abounds\nin Paris in our day and produces treasures for all Europe. Each thing\nhad the novel charm of unique perfection. The models being destroyed,\nevery vase, every figure, every piece of sculpture was the original.\nThis is the crowning grace of modern luxury. To own the thing which\nis not vulgarized by the two thousand wealthy citizens whose notion of\nluxury is the lavish display of the splendors that shops can supply, is\nthe stamp of true luxury--the luxury of the fine gentlemen of the day,\nthe shooting stars of the Paris firmament.\n\nAs she examined the flower-stands, filled with the choicest exotic\nplants, mounted in chased brass and inlaid in the style of Boulle, the\nBaroness was scared by the idea of the wealth in this apartment. And\nthis impression naturally shed a glamour over the person round whom all\nthis profusion was heaped. Adeline imagined that Josepha Mirah--whose\nportrait by Joseph Bridau was the glory of the adjoining boudoir--must\nbe a singer of genius, a Malibran, and she expected to see a real star.\nShe was sorry she had come. But she had been prompted by a strong and\nso natural a feeling, by such purely disinterested devotion, that she\ncollected all her courage for the interview. Besides, she was about to\nsatisfy her urgent curiosity, to see for herself what was the charm\nof this kind of women, that they could extract so much gold from the\nmiserly ore of Paris mud.\n\nThe Baroness looked at herself to see if she were not a blot on all this\nsplendor; but she was well dressed in her velvet gown, with a little\ncape trimmed with beautiful lace, and her velvet bonnet of the same\nshade was becoming. Seeing herself still as imposing as any queen,\nalways a queen even in her fall, she reflected that the dignity of\nsorrow was a match for the dignity of talent.\n\nAt last, after much opening and shutting of doors, she saw Josepha. The\nsinger bore a strong resemblance to Allori's _Judith_, which dwells in\nthe memory of all who have ever seen it in the Pitti palace, near the\ndoor of one of the great rooms. She had the same haughty mien, the same\nfine features, black hair simply knotted, and a yellow wrapper with\nlittle embroidered flowers, exactly like the brocade worn by the\nimmortal homicide conceived of by Bronzino's nephew.\n\n\"Madame la Baronne, I am quite overwhelmed by the honor you do me in\ncoming here,\" said the singer, resolved to play her part as a great lady\nwith a grace.\n\nShe pushed forward an easy-chair for the Baroness and seated herself on\na stool. She discerned the faded beauty of the woman before her, and was\nfilled with pity as she saw her shaken by the nervous palsy that, on\nthe least excitement, became convulsive. She could read at a glance the\nsaintly life described to her of old by Hulot and Crevel; and she not\nonly ceased to think of a contest with her, she humiliated herself\nbefore a superiority she appreciated. The great artist could admire what\nthe courtesan laughed to scorn.\n\n\"Mademoiselle, despair brought me here. It reduces us to any means--\"\n\nA look in Josepha's face made the Baroness feel that she had wounded\nthe woman from whom she hoped for so much, and she looked at her. Her\nbeseeching eyes extinguished the flash in Josepha's; the singer smiled.\nIt was a wordless dialogue of pathetic eloquence.\n\n\"It is now two years and a half since Monsieur Hulot left his family,\nand I do not know where to find him, though I know that he lives in\nParis,\" said the Baroness with emotion. \"A dream suggested to me the\nidea--an absurd one perhaps--that you may have interested yourself in\nMonsieur Hulot. If you could enable me to see him--oh! mademoiselle, I\nwould pray Heaven for you every day as long as I live in this world--\"\n\nTwo large tears in the singer's eyes told what her reply would be.\n\n\"Madame,\" said she, \"I have done you an injury without knowing you; but,\nnow that I have the happiness of seeing in you the most perfect virtue\non earth, believe me I am sensible of the extent of my fault; I repent\nsincerely, and believe me, I will do all in my power to remedy it!\"\n\nShe took Madame Hulot's hand and before the lady could do anything to\nhinder her, she kissed it respectfully, even humbling herself to bend\none knee. Then she rose, as proud as when she stood on the stage in the\npart of _Mathilde_, and rang the bell.\n\n\"Go on horseback,\" said she to the man-servant, \"and kill the horse if\nyou must, to find little Bijou, Rue Saint-Maur-du-Temple, and bring her\nhere. Put her into a coach and pay the coachman to come at a gallop. Do\nnot lose a moment--or you lose your place.\n\n\"Madame,\" she went on, coming back to the Baroness, and speaking to\nher in respectful tones, \"you must forgive me. As soon as the Duc\nd'Herouville became my protector, I dismissed the Baron, having heard\nthat he was ruining his family for me. What more could I do? In an\nactress' career a protector is indispensable from the first day of her\nappearance on the boards. Our salaries do not pay half our expenses; we\nmust have a temporary husband. I did not value Monsieur Hulot, who took\nme away from a rich man, a conceited idiot. Old Crevel would undoubtedly\nhave married me--\"\n\n\"So he told me,\" said the Baroness, interrupting her.\n\n\"Well, then, you see, madame, I might at this day have been an honest\nwoman, with only one legitimate husband!\"\n\n\"You have many excuses, mademoiselle,\" said Adeline, \"and God will take\nthem into account. But, for my part, far from reproaching you, I came,\non the contrary, to make myself your debtor in gratitude--\"\n\n\"Madame, for nearly three years I have provided for Monsieur le Baron's\nnecessities--\"\n\n\"You?\" interrupted the Baroness, with tears in her eyes. \"Oh, what can I\ndo for you? I can only pray--\"\n\n\"I and Monsieur le Duc d'Herouville,\" the singer said, \"a noble soul,\na true gentleman--\" and Josepha related the settling and _marriage_ of\nMonsieur Thoul.\n\n\"And so, thanks to you, mademoiselle, the Baron has wanted nothing?\"\n\n\"We have done our best to that end, madame.\"\n\n\"And where is he now?\"\n\n\"About six months ago, Monsieur le Duc told me that the Baron, known to\nthe notary by the name of Thoul, had drawn all the eight thousand\nfrancs that were to have been paid to him in fixed sums once a quarter,\"\nreplied Josepha. \"We have heard no more of the Baron, neither I nor\nMonsieur d'Herouville. Our lives are so full, we artists are so busy,\nthat I really have not time to run after old Thoul. As it happens, for\nthe last six months, Bijou, who works for me--his--what shall I say--?\"\n\n\"His mistress,\" said Madame Hulot.\n\n\"His mistress,\" repeated Josepha, \"has not been here. Mademoiselle\nOlympe Bijou is perhaps divorced. Divorce is common in the thirteenth\narrondissement.\"\n\nJosepha rose, and foraging among the rare plants in her stands, made a\ncharming bouquet for Madame Hulot, whose expectations, it may be said,\nwere by no means fulfilled. Like those worthy fold, who take men of\ngenius to be a sort of monsters, eating, drinking, walking, and speaking\nunlike other people, the Baroness had hoped to see Josepha the opera\nsinger, the witch, the amorous and amusing courtesan; she saw a calm and\nwell-mannered woman, with the dignity of talent, the simplicity of an\nactress who knows herself to be at night a queen, and also, better than\nall, a woman of the town whose eyes, attitude, and demeanor paid full\nand ungrudging homage to the virtuous wife, the _Mater dolorosa_ of\nthe sacred hymn, and who was crowning her sorrows with flowers, as the\nMadonna is crowned in Italy.\n\n\"Madame,\" said the man-servant, reappearing at the end of half an hour,\n\"Madame Bijou is on her way, but you are not to expect little Olympe.\nYour needle-woman, madame, is settled in life; she is married--\"\n\n\"More or less?\" said Josepha.\n\n\"No, madame, really married. She is at the head of a very fine business;\nshe has married the owner of a large and fashionable shop, on which they\nhave spent millions of francs, on the Boulevard des Italiens; and she\nhas left the embroidery business to her sister and mother. She is Madame\nGrenouville. The fat tradesman--\"\n\n\"A Crevel?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame,\" said the man. \"Well, he has settled thirty thousand\nfrancs a year on Mademoiselle Bijou by the marriage articles. And her\nelder sister, they say, is going to be married to a rich butcher.\"\n\n\"Your business looks rather hopeless, I am afraid,\" said Josepha to the\nBaroness. \"Monsieur le Baron is no longer where I lodged him.\"\n\nTen minutes later Madame Bijou was announced. Josepha very prudently\nplaced the Baroness in the boudoir, and drew the curtain over the door.\n\n\"You would scare her,\" said she to Madame Hulot. \"She would let nothing\nout if she suspected that you were interested in the information. Leave\nme to catechise her. Hide there, and you will hear everything. It is a\nscene that is played quite as often in real life as on the stage--\"\n\n\"Well, Mother Bijou,\" she said to an old woman dressed in tartan stuff,\nand who looked like a porter's wife in her Sunday best, \"so you are all\nvery happy? Your daughter is in luck.\"\n\n\"Oh, happy? As for that!--My daughter gives us a hundred francs a\nmonth, while she rides in a carriage and eats off silver plate--she is a\nmillionary, is my daughter! Olympe might have lifted me above labor. To\nhave to work at my age? Is that being good to me?\"\n\n\"She ought not to be ungrateful, for she owes her beauty to you,\"\nreplied Josepha; \"but why did she not come to see me? It was I who\nplaced her in ease by settling her with my uncle.\"\n\n\"Yes, madame, with old Monsieur Thoul, but he is very old and broken--\"\n\n\"But what have you done with him? Is he with you? She was very foolish\nto leave him; he is worth millions now.\"\n\n\"Heaven above us!\" cried the mother. \"What did I tell her when she\nbehaved so badly to him, and he as mild as milk, poor old fellow? Oh!\ndidn't she just give it him hot?--Olympe was perverted, madame?\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"She got to know a _claqueur_, madame, saving your presence, a man paid\nto clap, you know, the grand nephew of an old mattress-picker of the\nFaubourg Saint-Marceau. This good-for-naught, as all your good-looking\nfellows are, paid to make a piece go, is the cock of the walk out on\nthe Boulevard du Temple, where he works up the new plays, and takes care\nthat the actresses get a reception, as he calls it. First, he has a good\nbreakfast in the morning; then, before the play, he dines, to be 'up\nto the mark,' as he says; in short, he is a born lover of billiards and\ndrams. 'But that is not following a trade,' as I said to Olympe.\"\n\n\"It is a trade men follow, unfortunately,\" said Josepha.\n\n\"Well, the rascal turned Olympe's head, and he, madame, did not keep\ngood company--when I tell you he was very near being nabbed by the\npolice in a tavern where thieves meet. 'Wever, Monsieur Braulard, the\nleader of the claque, got him out of that. He wears gold earrings, and\nhe lives by doing nothing, hanging on to women, who are fools about\nthese good-looking scamps. He spent all the money Monsieur Thoul used to\ngive the child.\n\n\"Then the business was going to grief; what embroidery brought in went\nout across the billiard table. 'Wever, the young fellow had a pretty\nsister, madame, who, like her brother, lived by hook and by crook, and\nno better than she should be neither, over in the students' quarter.\"\n\n\"One of the sluts at the Chaumiere,\" said Josepha.\n\n\"So, madame,\" said the old woman. \"So Idamore, his name is Idamore,\nleastways that is what he calls himself, for his real name is\nChardin--Idamore fancied that your uncle had a deal more money than he\nowned to, and he managed to send his sister Elodie--and that was a stage\nname he gave her--to send her to be a workwoman at our place, without\nmy daughter's knowing who she was; and, gracious goodness! but that girl\nturned the whole place topsy-turvy; she got all those poor girls into\nmischief--impossible to whitewash them, saving your presence----\n\n\"And she was so sharp, she won over poor old Thoul, and took him away,\nand we don't know where, and left us in a pretty fix, with a lot of\nbills coming in. To this day as ever is we have not been able to settle\nup; but my daughter, who knows all about such things, keeps an eye on\nthem as they fall due.--Then, when Idamore saw he had got hold of the\nold man, through his sister, you understand, he threw over my daughter,\nand now he has got hold of a little actress at the _Funambules_.--And\nthat was how my daughter came to get married, as you will see--\"\n\n\"But you must know where the mattress-picker lives?\" said Josepha.\n\n\"What! old Chardin? As if he lived anywhere at all!--He is drunk by six\nin the morning; he makes a mattress once a month; he hangs about the\nwineshops all day; he plays at pools--\"\n\n\"He plays at pools?\" said Josepha.\n\n\"You do not understand, madame, pools of billiards, I mean, and he wins\nthree or four a day, and then he drinks.\"\n\n\"Water out of the pools, I suppose?\" said Josepha. \"But if Idamore\nhaunts the Boulevard, by inquiring through my friend Vraulard, we could\nfind him.\"\n\n\"I don't know, madame; all this was six months ago. Idamore was one of\nthe sort who are bound to find their way into the police courts, and\nfrom that to Melun--and the--who knows--?\"\n\n\"To the prison yard!\" said Josepha.\n\n\"Well, madame, you know everything,\" said the old woman, smiling. \"Well,\nif my girl had never known that scamp, she would now be--Still, she was\nin luck, all the same, you will say, for Monsieur Grenouville fell so\nmuch in love with her that he married her--\"\n\n\"And what brought that about?\"\n\n\"Olympe was desperate, madame. When she found herself left in the lurch\nfor that little actress--and she took a rod out of pickle for her, I can\ntell you; my word, but she gave her a dressing!--and when she had lost\npoor old Thoul, who worshiped her, she would have nothing more to say to\nthe men. 'Wever, Monsieur Grenouville, who had been dealing largely\nwith us--to the tune of two hundred embroidered China-crape shawls every\nquarter--he wanted to console her; but whether or no, she would not\nlisten to anything without the mayor and the priest. 'I mean to be\nrespectable,' said she, 'or perish!' and she stuck to it. Monsieur\nGrenouville consented to marry her, on condition of her giving us all\nup, and we agreed--\"\n\n\"For a handsome consideration?\" said Josepha, with her usual\nperspicacity.\n\n\"Yes, madame, ten thousand francs, and an allowance to my father, who is\npast work.\"\n\n\"I begged your daughter to make old Thoul happy, and she has thrown\nme over. That is not fair. I will take no interest in any one for the\nfuture! That is what comes of trying to do good! Benevolence certainly\ndoes not answer as a speculation!--Olympe ought, at least, to have given\nme notice of this jobbing. Now, if you find the old man Thoul within a\nfortnight, I will give you a thousand francs.\"\n\n\"It will be a hard task, my good lady; still, there are a good many\nfive-franc pieces in a thousand francs, and I will try to earn your\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Good-morning, then, Madame Bijou.\"\n\nOn going into the boudoir, the singer found that Madame Hulot had\nfainted; but in spite of having lost consciousness, her nervous\ntrembling kept her still perpetually shaking, as the pieces of a snake\nthat has been cut up still wriggle and move. Strong salts, cold water,\nand all the ordinary remedies were applied to recall the Baroness to her\nsenses, or rather, to the apprehension of her sorrows.\n\n\"Ah! mademoiselle, how far has he fallen!\" cried she, recognizing\nJosepha, and finding that she was alone with her.\n\n\"Take heart, madame,\" replied the actress, who had seated herself on\na cushion at Adeline's feet, and was kissing her hands. \"We shall find\nhim; and if he is in the mire, well, he must wash himself. Believe me,\nwith people of good breeding it is a matter of clothes.--Allow me to\nmake up for you the harm I have done you, for I see how much you are\nattached to your husband, in spite of his misconduct--or you should not\nhave come here.--Well, you see, the poor man is so fond of women. If you\nhad had a little of our dash, you would have kept him from running about\nthe world; for you would have been what we can never be--all the women\nman wants.\n\n\"The State ought to subsidize a school of manners for honest women!\nBut governments are so prudish! Still, they are guided by men, whom we\nprivately guide. My word, I pity nations!\n\n\"But the matter in question is how you can be helped, and not to laugh\nat the world.--Well, madame, be easy, go home again, and do not worry. I\nwill bring your Hector back to you as he was as a man of thirty.\"\n\n\"Ah, mademoiselle, let us go to see that Madame Grenouville,\" said the\nBaroness. \"She surely knows something! Perhaps I may see the Baron this\nvery day, and be able to snatch him at once from poverty and disgrace.\"\n\n\"Madame, I will show you the deep gratitude I feel towards you by not\ndisplaying the stage-singer Josepha, the Duc d'Herouville's mistress,\nin the company of the noblest, saintliest image of virtue. I respect\nyou too much to be seen by your side. This is not acted humility; it is\nsincere homage. You make me sorry, madame, that I cannot tread in your\nfootsteps, in spite of the thorns that tear your feet and hands.--But it\ncannot be helped! I am one with art, as you are one with virtue.\"\n\n\"Poor child!\" said the Baroness, moved amid her own sorrows by a strange\nsense of compassionate sympathy; \"I will pray to God for you; for you\nare the victim of society, which must have theatres. When you are old,\nrepent--you will be heard if God vouchsafes to hear the prayers of a--\"\n\n\"Of a martyr, madame,\" Josepha put in, and she respectfully kissed the\nBaroness' skirt.\n\nBut Adeline took the actress' hand, and drawing her towards her, kissed\nher on the forehead. Coloring with pleasure Josepha saw the Baroness\ninto the hackney coach with the humblest politeness.\n\n\"It must be some visiting Lady of Charity,\" said the man-servant to the\nmaid, \"for she does not do so much for any one, not even for her dear\nfriend Madame Jenny Cadine.\"\n\n\"Wait a few days,\" said she, \"and you will see him, madame, or I\nrenounce the God of my fathers--and that from a Jewess, you know, is a\npromise of success.\"\n\n\n\nAt the very time when Madame Hulot was calling on Josepha, Victorin,\nin his study, was receiving an old woman of about seventy-five, who, to\ngain admission to the lawyer, had used the terrible name of the head of\nthe detective force. The man in waiting announced:\n\n\"Madame de Saint-Esteve.\"\n\n\"I have assumed one of my business names,\" said she, taking a seat.\n\nVictorin felt a sort of internal chill at the sight of this dreadful old\nwoman. Though handsomely dressed, she was terrible to look upon, for her\nflat, colorless, strongly-marked face, furrowed with wrinkles, expressed\na sort of cold malignity. Marat, as a woman of that age, might have been\nlike this creature, a living embodiment of the Reign of Terror.\n\nThis sinister old woman's small, pale eyes twinkled with a tiger's\nbloodthirsty greed. Her broad, flat nose, with nostrils expanded into\noval cavities, breathed the fires of hell, and resembled the beak of\nsome evil bird of prey. The spirit of intrigue lurked behind her low,\ncruel brow. Long hairs had grown from her wrinkled chin, betraying the\nmasculine character of her schemes. Any one seeing that woman's\nface would have said that artists had failed in their conceptions of\nMephistopheles.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" she began, with a patronizing air, \"I have long since\ngiven up active business of any kind. What I have come to you to do, I\nhave undertaken, for the sake of my dear nephew, whom I love more than\nI could love a son of my own.--Now, the Head of the Police--to whom\nthe President of the Council said a few words in his ear as regards\nyourself, in talking to Monsieur Chapuzot--thinks as the police ought\nnot to appear in a matter of this description, you understand. They gave\nmy nephew a free hand, but my nephew will have nothing to say to it,\nexcept as before the Council; he will not be seen in it.\"\n\n\"Then your nephew is--\"\n\n\"You have hit it, and I am rather proud of him,\" said she, interrupting\nthe lawyer, \"for he is my pupil, and he soon could teach his\nteacher.--We have considered this case, and have come to our own\nconclusions. Will you hand over thirty thousand francs to have the whole\nthing taken off your hands? I will make a clean sweep of all, and you\nneed not pay till the job is done.\"\n\n\"Do you know the persons concerned?\"\n\n\"No, my dear sir; I look for information from you. What we are told is,\nthat a certain old idiot has fallen into the clutches of a widow. This\nwidow, of nine-and-twenty, has played her cards so well, that she has\nforty thousand francs a year, of which she has robbed two fathers of\nfamilies. She is now about to swallow down eighty thousand francs a year\nby marrying an old boy of sixty-one. She will thus ruin a respectable\nfamily, and hand over this vast fortune to the child of some lover by\ngetting rid at once of the old husband.--That is the case as stated.\"\n\n\"Quite correct,\" said Victorin. \"My father-in-law, Monsieur Crevel--\"\n\n\"Formerly a perfumer, a mayor--yes, I live in his district under the\nname of Ma'ame Nourrisson,\" said the woman.\n\n\"The other person is Madame Marneffe.\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" said Madame de Saint-Esteve. \"But within three days I\nwill be in a position to count her shifts.\"\n\n\"Can you hinder the marriage?\" asked Victorin.\n\n\"How far have they got?\"\n\n\"To the second time of asking.\"\n\n\"We must carry off the woman.--To-day is Sunday--there are but\nthree days, for they will be married on Wednesday, no doubt; it is\nimpossible.--But she may be killed--\"\n\nVictorin Hulot started with an honest man's horror at hearing these five\nwords uttered in cold blood.\n\n\"Murder?\" said he. \"And how could you do it?\"\n\n\"For forty years, now, monsieur, we have played the part of fate,\"\nreplied she, with terrible pride, \"and do just what we will in Paris.\nMore than one family--even in the Faubourg Saint-Germain--has told me\nall its secrets, I can tell you. I have made and spoiled many a match,\nI have destroyed many a will and saved many a man's honor. I have in\nthere,\" and she tapped her forehead, \"a store of secrets which are worth\nthirty-six thousand francs a year to me; and you--you will be one of my\nlambs, hoh! Could such a woman as I am be what I am if she revealed her\nways and means? I act.\n\n\"Whatever I may do, sir, will be the result of an accident; you need\nfeel no remorse. You will be like a man cured by a clairvoyant; by the\nend of a month, it seems all the work of Nature.\"\n\nVictorin broke out in a cold sweat. The sight of an executioner would\nhave shocked him less than this prolix and pretentious Sister of the\nHulks. As he looked at her purple-red gown, she seemed to him dyed in\nblood.\n\n\"Madame, I do not accept the help of your experience and skill if\nsuccess is to cost anybody's life, or the least criminal act is to come\nof it.\"\n\n\"You are a great baby, monsieur,\" replied the woman; \"you wish to remain\nblameless in your own eyes, while you want your enemy to be overthrown.\"\n\nVictorin shook his head in denial.\n\n\"Yes,\" she went on, \"you want this Madame Marneffe to drop the prey she\nhas between her teeth. But how do you expect to make a tiger drop his\npiece of beef? Can you do it by patting his back and saying, 'Poor\nPuss'? You are illogical. You want a battle fought, but you object to\nblows.--Well, I grant you the innocence you are so careful over. I have\nalways found that there was material for hypocrisy in honesty! One day,\nthree months hence, a poor priest will come to beg of you forty thousand\nfrancs for a pious work--a convent to be rebuilt in the Levant--in\nthe desert.--If you are satisfied with your lot, give the good man the\nmoney. You will pay more than that into the treasury. It will be a mere\ntrifle in comparison with what you will get, I can tell you.\"\n\nShe rose, standing on the broad feet that seemed to overflow her satin\nshoes; she smiled, bowed, and vanished.\n\n\"The Devil has a sister,\" said Victorin, rising.\n\nHe saw the hideous stranger to the door, a creature called up from the\ndens of the police, as on the stage a monster comes up from the third\ncellar at the touch of a fairy's wand in a ballet-extravaganza.\n\nAfter finishing what he had to do at the Courts, Victorin went to call\non Monsieur Chapuzot, the head of one of the most important branches of\nthe Central Police, to make some inquiries about the stranger. Finding\nMonsieur Chapuzot alone in his office, Victorin thanked him for his\nhelp.\n\n\"You sent me an old woman who might stand for the incarnation of the\ncriminal side of Paris.\"\n\nMonsieur Chapuzot laid his spectacles on his papers and looked at the\nlawyer with astonishment.\n\n\"I should not have taken the liberty of sending anybody to see you\nwithout giving you notice beforehand, or a line of introduction,\" said\nhe.\n\n\"Then it was Monsieur le Prefet--?\"\n\n\"I think not,\" said Chapuzot. \"The last time that the Prince de\nWissembourg dined with the Minister of the Interior, he spoke to\nthe Prefet of the position in which you find yourself--a deplorable\nposition--and asked him if you could be helped in any friendly way. The\nPrefet, who was interested by the regrets his Excellency expressed as to\nthis family affair, did me the honor to consult me about it.\n\n\"Ever since the present Prefet has held the reins of this department--so\nuseful and so vilified--he has made it a rule that family matters are\nnever to be interfered in. He is right in principle and in morality; but\nin practice he is wrong. In the forty-five years that I have served\nin the police, it did, from 1799 till 1815, great services in family\nconcerns. Since 1820 a constitutional government and the press have\ncompletely altered the conditions of existence. So my advice, indeed,\nwas not to intervene in such a case, and the Prefet did me the honor to\nagree with my remarks. The Head of the detective branch has orders, in\nmy presence, to take no steps; so if you have had any one sent to you\nby him, he will be reprimanded. It might cost him his place. 'The Police\nwill do this or that,' is easily said; the Police, the Police! But, my\ndear sir, the Marshal and the Ministerial Council do not know what the\nPolice is. The Police alone knows the Police; but as for ours, only\nFouche, Monsieur Lenoir, and Monsieur de Sartines have had any notion of\nit.--Everything is changed now; we are reduced and disarmed! I have seen\nmany private disasters develop, which I could have checked with five\ngrains of despotic power.--We shall be regretted by the very men who\nhave crippled us when they, like you, stand face to face with some moral\nmonstrosities, which ought to be swept away as we sweep away mud! In\npublic affairs the Police is expected to foresee everything, or when the\nsafety of the public is involved--but the family?--It is sacred! I would\ndo my utmost to discover and hinder a plot against the King's life, I\nwould see through the walls of a house; but as to laying a finger on a\nhousehold, or peeping into private interests--never, so long as I sit in\nthis office. I should be afraid.\"\n\n\"Of what?\"\n\n\"Of the Press, Monsieur le Depute, of the left centre.\"\n\n\"What, then, can I do?\" said Hulot, after a pause.\n\n\"Well, you are the Family,\" said the official. \"That settles it; you can\ndo what you please. But as to helping you, as to using the Police as an\ninstrument of private feelings, and interests, how is it possible? There\nlies, you see, the secret of the persecution, necessary, but pronounced\nillegal, by the Bench, which was brought to bear against the predecessor\nof our present chief detective. Bibi-Lupin undertook investigations\nfor the benefit of private persons. This might have led to great\nsocial dangers. With the means at his command, the man would have been\nformidable, an underlying fate--\"\n\n\"But in my place?\" said Hulot.\n\n\"Why, you ask my advice? You who sell it!\" replied Monsieur Chapuzot.\n\"Come, come, my dear sir, you are making fun of me.\"\n\nHulot bowed to the functionary, and went away without seeing that\ngentleman's almost imperceptible shrug as he rose to open the door.\n\n\"And he wants to be a statesman!\" said Chapuzot to himself as he\nreturned to his reports.\n\nVictorin went home, still full of perplexities which he could confide to\nno one.\n\nAt dinner the Baroness joyfully announced to her children that within a\nmonth their father might be sharing their comforts, and end his days in\npeace among his family.\n\n\"Oh, I would gladly give my three thousand six hundred francs a year to\nsee the Baron here!\" cried Lisbeth. \"But, my dear Adeline, do not dream\nbeforehand of such happiness, I entreat you!\"\n\n\"Lisbeth is right,\" said Celestine. \"My dear mother, wait till the end.\"\n\nThe Baroness, all feeling and all hope, related her visit to Josepha,\nexpressed her sense of the misery of such women in the midst of good\nfortune, and mentioned Chardin the mattress-picker, the father of the\nOran storekeeper, thus showing that her hopes were not groundless.\n\n\n\nBy seven next morning Lisbeth had driven in a hackney coach to the Quai\nde la Tournelle, and stopped the vehicle at the corner of the Rue de\nPoissy.\n\n\"Go to the Rue des Bernardins,\" said she to the driver, \"No. 7, a house\nwith an entry and no porter. Go up to the fourth floor, ring at the\ndoor to the left, on which you will see 'Mademoiselle Chardin--Lace and\nshawls mended.' She will answer the door. Ask for the Chevalier. She\nwill say he is out. Say in reply, 'Yes, I know, but find him, for his\n_bonne_ is out on the quay in a coach, and wants to see him.'\"\n\nTwenty minutes later, an old man, who looked about eighty, with\nperfectly white hair, and a nose reddened by the cold, and a pale,\nwrinkled face like an old woman's, came shuffling slowly along in list\nslippers, a shiny alpaca overcoat hanging on his stooping shoulders, no\nribbon at his buttonhole, the sleeves of an under-vest showing below\nhis coat-cuffs, and his shirt-front unpleasantly dingy. He approached\ntimidly, looked at the coach, recognized Lisbeth, and came to the\nwindow.\n\n\"Why, my dear cousin, what a state you are in!\"\n\n\"Elodie keeps everything for herself,\" said Baron Hulot. \"Those Chardins\nare a blackguard crew.\"\n\n\"Will you come home to us?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no!\" cried the old man. \"I would rather go to America.\"\n\n\"Adeline is on the scent.\"\n\n\"Oh, if only some one would pay my debts!\" said the Baron, with a\nsuspicious look, \"for Samanon is after me.\"\n\n\"We have not paid up the arrears yet; your son still owes a hundred\nthousand francs.\"\n\n\"Poor boy!\"\n\n\"And your pension will not be free before seven or eight months.--If you\nwill wait a minute, I have two thousand francs here.\"\n\nThe Baron held out his hand with fearful avidity.\n\n\"Give it me, Lisbeth, and may God reward you! Give it me; I know where\nto go.\"\n\n\"But you will tell me, old wretch?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. Then I can wait eight months, for I have discovered a little\nangel, a good child, an innocent thing not old enough to be depraved.\"\n\n\"Do not forget the police-court,\" said Lisbeth, who flattered herself\nthat she would some day see Hulot there.\n\n\"No.--It is in the Rue de Charonne,\" said the Baron, \"a part of the town\nwhere no fuss is made about anything. No one will ever find me there.\nI am called Pere Thorec, Lisbeth, and I shall be taken for a retired\ncabinet-maker; the girl is fond of me, and I will not allow my back to\nbe shorn any more.\"\n\n\"No, that has been done,\" said Lisbeth, looking at his coat. \"Supposing\nI take you there.\"\n\nBaron Hulot got into the coach, deserting Mademoiselle Elodie without\ntaking leave of her, as he might have tossed aside a novel he had\nfinished.\n\nIn half an hour, during which Baron Hulot talked to Lisbeth of nothing\nbut little Atala Judici--for he had fallen by degrees to those base\npassions that ruin old men--she set him down with two thousand francs in\nhis pocket, in the Rue de Charonne, Faubourg Saint-Antoine, at the door\nof a doubtful and sinister-looking house.\n\n\"Good-day, cousin; so now you are to be called Thorec, I suppose? Send\nnone but commissionaires if you need me, and always take them from\ndifferent parts.\"\n\n\"Trust me! Oh, I am really very lucky!\" said the Baron, his face beaming\nwith the prospect of new and future happiness.\n\n\"No one can find him there,\" said Lisbeth; and she paid the coach at the\nBoulevard Beaumarchais, and returned to the Rue Louis-le-Grand in the\nomnibus.\n\nOn the following day Crevel was announced at the hour when all the\nfamily were together in the drawing-room, just after breakfast.\nCelestine flew to throw her arms round her father's neck, and behaved\nas if she had seen him only the day before, though in fact he had not\ncalled there for more than two years.\n\n\"Good-morning, father,\" said Victorin, offering his hand.\n\n\"Good-morning, children,\" said the pompous Crevel. \"Madame la Baronne, I\nthrow myself at your feet! Good Heavens, how the children grow! they are\npushing us off the perch--'Grand-pa,' they say, 'we want our turn in the\nsunshine.'--Madame la Comtesse, you are as lovely as ever,\" he went\non, addressing Hortense.--\"Ah, ha! and here is the best of good money:\nCousin Betty, the Wise Virgin.\"\n\n\"Why, you are really very comfortable here,\" said he, after scattering\nthese greetings with a cackle of loud laughter that hardly moved the\nrubicund muscles of his broad face.\n\nHe looked at his daughter with some contempt.\n\n\"My dear Celestine, I will make you a present of all my furniture out\nof the Rue des Saussayes; it will just do here. Your drawing-room wants\nfurnishing up.--Ha! there is that little rogue Wenceslas. Well, and\nare we very good children, I wonder? You must have pretty manners, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"To make up for those who have none,\" said Lisbeth.\n\n\"That sarcasm, my dear Lisbeth, has lost its sting. I am going, my dear\nchildren, to put an end to the false position in which I have so long\nbeen placed; I have come, like a good father, to announce my approaching\nmarriage without any circumlocution.\"\n\n\"You have a perfect right to marry,\" said Victorin. \"And for my part,\nI give you back the promise you made me when you gave me the hand of my\ndear Celestine--\"\n\n\"What promise?\" said Crevel.\n\n\"Not to marry,\" replied the lawyer. \"You will do me the justice to allow\nthat I did not ask you to pledge yourself, that you gave your word quite\nvoluntarily and in spite of my desire, for I pointed out to you at the\ntime that you were unwise to bind yourself.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do remember, my dear fellow,\" said Crevel, ashamed of himself.\n\"But, on my honor, if you will but live with Madame Crevel, my children,\nyou will find no reason to repent.--Your good feeling touches\nme, Victorin, and you will find that generosity to me is not\nunrewarded.--Come, by the Poker! welcome your stepmother and come to the\nwedding.\"\n\n\"But you have not told us the lady's name, papa,\" said Celestine.\n\n\"Why, it is an open secret,\" replied Crevel. \"Do not let us play at\nguess who can! Lisbeth must have told you.\"\n\n\"My dear Monsieur Crevel,\" replied Lisbeth, \"there are certain names we\nnever utter here--\"\n\n\"Well, then, it is Madame Marneffe.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Crevel,\" said the lawyer very sternly, \"neither my wife nor I\ncan be present at that marriage; not out of interest, for I spoke in\nall sincerity just now. Yes, I am most happy to think that you may find\nhappiness in this union; but I act on considerations of honor and good\nfeeling which you must understand, and which I cannot speak of here, as\nthey reopen wounds still ready to bleed----\"\n\nThe Baroness telegraphed a signal to Hortense, who tucked her little one\nunder her arm, saying, \"Come Wenceslas, and have your bath!--Good-bye,\nMonsieur Crevel.\"\n\nThe Baroness also bowed to Crevel without a word; and Crevel could\nnot help smiling at the child's astonishment when threatened with this\nimpromptu tubbing.\n\n\"You, monsieur,\" said Victorin, when he found himself alone with\nLisbeth, his wife, and his father-in-law, \"are about to marry a woman\nloaded with the spoils of my father; it was she who, in cold blood,\nbrought him down to such depths; a woman who is the son-in-law's\nmistress after ruining the father-in-law; who is the cause of constant\ngrief to my sister!--And you fancy that I shall seem to sanction your\nmadness by my presence? I deeply pity you, dear Monsieur Crevel; you\nhave no family feeling; you do not understand the unity of the honor\nwhich binds the members of it together. There is no arguing with\npassion--as I have too much reason to know. The slaves of their passions\nare as deaf as they are blind. Your daughter Celestine has too strong a\nsense of her duty to proffer a word of reproach.\"\n\n\"That would, indeed, be a pretty thing!\" cried Crevel, trying to cut\nshort this harangue.\n\n\"Celestine would not be my wife if she made the slightest remonstrance,\"\nthe lawyer went on. \"But I, at least, may try to stop you before you\nstep over the precipice, especially after giving you ample proof of my\ndisinterestedness. It is not your fortune, it is you that I care about.\nNay, to make it quite plain to you, I may add, if it were only to set\nyour mind at ease with regard to your marriage contract, that I am now\nin a position which leaves me with nothing to wish for--\"\n\n\"Thanks to me!\" exclaimed Crevel, whose face was purple.\n\n\"Thanks to Celestine's fortune,\" replied Victorin. \"And if you regret\nhaving given to your daughter as a present from yourself, a sum which is\nnot half what her mother left her, I can only say that we are prepared\nto give it back.\"\n\n\"And do you not know, my respected son-in-law,\" said Crevel, striking\nan attitude, \"that under the shelter of my name Madame Marneffe is not\ncalled upon to answer for her conduct excepting as my wife--as Madame\nCrevel?\"\n\n\"That is, no doubt, quite the correct thing,\" said the lawyer; \"very\ngenerous so far as the affections are concerned and the vagaries of\npassion; but I know of no name, nor law, nor title that can shelter\nthe theft of three hundred thousand francs so meanly wrung from my\nfather!--I tell you plainly, my dear father-in-law, your future wife\nis unworthy of you, she is false to you, and is madly in love with my\nbrother-in-law, Steinbock, whose debts she had paid.\"\n\n\"It is I who paid them!\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Hulot; \"I am glad for Count Steinbock's sake; he may\nsome day repay the money. But he is loved, much loved, and often--\"\n\n\"Loved!\" cried Crevel, whose face showed his utter bewilderment. \"It is\ncowardly, and dirty, and mean, and cheap, to calumniate a woman!--When a\nman says such things, monsieur, he must bring proof.\"\n\n\"I will bring proof.\"\n\n\"I shall expect it.\"\n\n\"By the day after to-morrow, my dear Monsieur Crevel, I shall be able\nto tell you the day, the hour, the very minute when I can expose the\nhorrible depravity of your future wife.\"\n\n\"Very well; I shall be delighted,\" said Crevel, who had recovered\nhimself.\n\n\"Good-bye, my children, for the present; good-bye, Lisbeth.\"\n\n\"See him out, Lisbeth,\" said Celestine in an undertone.\n\n\"And is this the way you take yourself off?\" cried Lisbeth to Crevel.\n\n\"Ah, ha!\" said Crevel, \"my son-in-law is too clever by half; he is\ngetting on. The Courts and the Chamber, judicial trickery and political\ndodges, are making a man of him with a vengeance!--So he knows I am to\nbe married on Wednesday, and on a Sunday my gentleman proposes to fix\nthe hour, within three days, when he can prove that my wife is unworthy\nof me. That is a good story!--Well, I am going back to sign the\ncontract. Come with me, Lisbeth--yes, come. They will never know. I\nmeant to have left Celestine forty thousand francs a year; but Hulot has\njust behaved in a way to alienate my affection for ever.\"\n\n\"Give me ten minutes, Pere Crevel; wait for me in your carriage at the\ngate. I will make some excuse for going out.\"\n\n\"Very well--all right.\"\n\n\"My dears,\" said Lisbeth, who found all the family reassembled in the\ndrawing-room, \"I am going with Crevel: the marriage contract is to be\nsigned this afternoon, and I shall hear what he has settled. It will\nprobably be my last visit to that woman. Your father is furious; he will\ndisinherit you--\"\n\n\"His vanity will prevent that,\" said the son-in-law. \"He was bent on\nowning the estate of Presles, and he will keep it; I know him. Even if\nhe were to have children, Celestine would still have half of what he\nmight leave; the law forbids his giving away all his fortune.--Still,\nthese questions are nothing to me; I am only thinking of our honor.--Go\nthen, cousin,\" and he pressed Lisbeth's hand, \"and listen carefully to\nthe contract.\"\n\n\n\nTwenty minutes after, Lisbeth and Crevel reached the house in the Rue\nBarbet, where Madame Marneffe was awaiting, in mild impatience, the\nresult of a step taken by her commands. Valerie had in the end fallen\na prey to the absorbing love which, once in her life, masters a woman's\nheart. Wenceslas was its object, and, a failure as an artist, he became\nin Madame Marneffe's hands a lover so perfect that he was to her what\nshe had been to Baron Hulot.\n\nValerie was holding a slipper in one hand, and Steinbock clasped the\nother, while her head rested on his shoulder. The rambling conversation\nin which they had been engaged ever since Crevel went out may be\nticketed, like certain lengthy literary efforts of our day, \"_All rights\nreserved_,\" for it cannot be reproduced. This masterpiece of personal\npoetry naturally brought a regret to the artist's lips, and he said, not\nwithout some bitterness:\n\n\"What a pity it is that I married; for if I had but waited, as Lisbeth\ntold me, I might now have married you.\"\n\n\"Who but a Pole would wish to make a wife of a devoted mistress?\" cried\nValerie. \"To change love into duty, and pleasure into a bore.\"\n\n\"I know you to be so fickle,\" replied Steinbock. \"Did I not hear you\ntalking to Lisbeth of that Brazilian, Baron Montes?\"\n\n\"Do you want to rid me of him?\"\n\n\"It would be the only way to hinder his seeing you,\" said the\nex-sculptor.\n\n\"Let me tell you, my darling--for I tell you everything,\" said\nValerie--\"I was saving him up for a husband.--The promises I have made\nto that man!--Oh, long before I knew you,\" said she, in reply to a\nmovement from Wenceslas. \"And those promises, of which he avails himself\nto plague me, oblige me to get married almost secretly; for if he should\nhear that I am marrying Crevel, he is the sort of man that--that would\nkill me.\"\n\n\"Oh, as to that!\" said Steinbock, with a scornful expression, which\nconveyed that such a danger was small indeed for a woman beloved by a\nPole.\n\nAnd in the matter of valor there is no brag or bravado in a Pole, so\nthoroughly and seriously brave are they all.\n\n\"And that idiot Crevel,\" she went on, \"who wants to make a great display\nand indulge his taste for inexpensive magnificence in honor of the\nwedding, places me in difficulties from which I see no escape.\"\n\nCould Valerie confess to this man, whom she adored, that since the\ndiscomfiture of Baron Hulot, this Baron Henri Montes had inherited the\nprivilege of calling on her at all hours of the day or night; and that,\nnotwithstanding her cleverness, she was still puzzled to find a cause of\nquarrel in which the Brazilian might seem to be solely in the wrong? She\nknew the Baron's almost savage temper--not unlike Lisbeth's--too well\nnot to quake as she thought of this Othello of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nAs the carriage drove up, Steinbock released Valerie, for his arm\nwas round her waist, and took up a newspaper, in which he was found\nabsorbed. Valerie was stitching with elaborate care at the slippers she\nwas working for Crevel.\n\n\"How they slander her!\" whispered Lisbeth to Crevel, pointing to this\npicture as they opened the door. \"Look at her hair--not in the\nleast tumbled. To hear Victorin, you might have expected to find two\nturtle-doves in a nest.\"\n\n\"My dear Lisbeth,\" cried Crevel, in his favorite position, \"you see that\nto turn Lucretia into Aspasia, you have only to inspire a passion!\"\n\n\"And have I not always told you,\" said Lisbeth, \"that women like a burly\nprofligate like you?\"\n\n\"And she would be most ungrateful, too,\" said Crevel; \"for as to the\nmoney I have spent here, Grindot and I alone can tell!\"\n\nAnd he waved a hand at the staircase.\n\nIn decorating this house, which Crevel regarded as his own, Grindot had\ntried to compete with Cleretti, in whose hands the Duc d'Herouville had\nplaced Josepha's villa. But Crevel, incapable of understanding art, had,\nlike all sordid souls, wanted to spend a certain sum fixed beforehand.\nGrindot, fettered by a contract, had found it impossible to embody his\narchitectural dream.\n\nThe difference between Josepha's house and that in the Rue Barbet was\njust that between the individual stamp on things and commonness. The\nobjects you admired at Crevel's were to be bought in any shop. These two\ntypes of luxury are divided by the river Million. A mirror, if unique,\nis worth six thousand francs; a mirror designed by a manufacturer who\nturns them out by the dozen costs five hundred. A genuine lustre by\nBoulle will sell at a public auction for three thousand francs; the\nsame thing reproduced by casting may be made for a thousand or twelve\nhundred; one is archaeologically what a picture by Raphael is in\npainting, the other is a copy. At what would you value a copy of a\nRaphael? Thus Crevel's mansion was a splendid example of the luxury of\nidiots, while Josepha's was a perfect model of an artist's home.\n\n\"War is declared,\" said Crevel, going up to Madame Marneffe.\n\nShe rang the bell.\n\n\"Go and find Monsieur Berthier,\" said she to the man-servant, \"and\ndo not return without him. If you had succeeded,\" said she, embracing\nCrevel, \"we would have postponed our happiness, my dear Daddy, and have\ngiven a really splendid entertainment; but when a whole family is set\nagainst a match, my dear, decency requires that the wedding shall be a\nquiet one, especially when the lady is a widow.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I intend to make a display of magnificence _a la_\nLouis XIV.,\" said Crevel, who of late had held the eighteenth century\nrather cheap. \"I have ordered new carriages; there is one for monsieur\nand one for madame, two neat coupes; and a chaise, a handsome traveling\ncarriage with a splendid hammercloth, on springs that tremble like\nMadame Hulot.\"\n\n\"Oh, ho! _You intend?_--Then you have ceased to be my lamb?--No, no,\nmy friend, you will do what _I_ intend. We will sign the contract\nquietly--just ourselves--this afternoon. Then, on Wednesday, we will\nbe regularly married, really married, in mufti, as my poor mother would\nhave said. We will walk to church, plainly dressed, and have only a low\nmass. Our witnesses are Stidmann, Steinbock, Vignon, and Massol, all\nwide-awake men, who will be at the mairie by chance, and who will so far\nsacrifice themselves as to attend mass.\n\n\"Your colleague will perform the civil marriage, for once in a way,\nas early as half-past nine. Mass is at ten; we shall be at home to\nbreakfast by half-past eleven.\n\n\"I have promised our guests that we will sit at table till the evening.\nThere will be Bixiou, your old official chum du Tillet, Lousteau,\nVernisset, Leon de Lora, Vernou, all the wittiest men in Paris, who will\nnot know that we are married. We will play them a little trick, we will\nget just a little tipsy, and Lisbeth must join us. I want her to\nstudy matrimony; Bixiou shall make love to her, and--and enlighten her\ndarkness.\"\n\nFor two hours Madame Marneffe went on talking nonsense, and Crevel made\nthis judicious reflection:\n\n\"How can so light-hearted a creature be utterly depraved?\nFeather-brained, yes! but wicked? Nonsense!\"\n\n\"Well, and what did the young people say about me?\" said Valerie to\nCrevel at a moment when he sat down by her on the sofa. \"All sorts of\nhorrors?\"\n\n\"They will have it that you have a criminal passion for Wenceslas--you,\nwho are virtue itself.\"\n\n\"I love him!--I should think so, my little Wenceslas!\" cried Valerie,\ncalling the artist to her, taking his face in her hands, and kissing his\nforehead. \"A poor boy with no fortune, and no one to depend on! Cast off\nby a carrotty giraffe! What do you expect, Crevel? Wenceslas is my poet,\nand I love him as if he were my own child, and make no secret of it.\nBah! your virtuous women see evil everywhere and in everything. Bless\nme, could they not sit by a man without doing wrong? I am a spoilt child\nwho has had all it ever wanted, and bonbons no longer excite me.--Poor\nthings! I am sorry for them!\n\n\"And who slandered me so?\"\n\n\"Victorin,\" said Crevel.\n\n\"Then why did you not stop his mouth, the odious legal macaw! with the\nstory of the two hundred thousand francs and his mamma?\"\n\n\"Oh, the Baroness had fled,\" said Lisbeth.\n\n\"They had better take care, Lisbeth,\" said Madame Marneffe, with a\nfrown. \"Either they will receive me and do it handsomely, and come to\ntheir stepmother's house--all the party!--or I will see them in lower\ndepths than the Baron has reached, and you may tell them I said so!--At\nlast I shall turn nasty. On my honor, I believe that evil is the scythe\nwith which to cut down the good.\"\n\nAt three o'clock Monsieur Berthier, Cardot's successor, read the\nmarriage-contract, after a short conference with Crevel, for some of\nthe articles were made conditional on the action taken by Monsieur and\nMadame Victorin Hulot.\n\nCrevel settled on his wife a fortune consisting, in the first place, of\nforty thousand francs in dividends on specified securities; secondly, of\nthe house and all its contents; and thirdly, of three million francs not\ninvested. He also assigned to his wife every benefit allowed by law;\nhe left all the property free of duty; and in the event of their dying\nwithout issue, each devised to the survivor the whole of their property\nand real estate.\n\nBy this arrangement the fortune left to Celestine and her husband was\nreduced to two millions of francs in capital. If Crevel and his second\nwife should have children, Celestine's share was limited to five hundred\nthousand francs, as the life-interest in the rest was to accrue to\nValerie. This would be about the ninth part of his whole real and\npersonal estate.\n\n\n\nLisbeth returned to dine in the Rue Louis-le-Grand, despair written on\nher face. She explained and bewailed the terms of the marriage-contract,\nbut found Celestine and her husband insensible to the disastrous news.\n\n\"You have provoked your father, my children. Madame Marneffe swears that\nyou shall receive Monsieur Crevel's wife and go to her house,\" said she.\n\n\"Never!\" said Victorin.\n\n\"Never!\" said Celestine.\n\n\"Never!\" said Hortense.\n\nLisbeth was possessed by the wish to crush the haughty attitude assumed\nby all the Hulots.\n\n\"She seems to have arms that she can turn against you,\" she replied.\n\"I do not know all about it, but I shall find out. She spoke vaguely\nof some history of two hundred thousand francs in which Adeline is\nimplicated.\"\n\nThe Baroness fell gently backward on the sofa she was sitting on in a\nfit of hysterical sobbing.\n\n\"Go there, go, my children!\" she cried. \"Receive the woman! Monsieur\nCrevel is an infamous wretch. He deserves the worst punishment\nimaginable.--Do as the woman desires you! She is a monster--she knows\nall!\"\n\nAfter gasping out these words with tears and sobs, Madame Hulot\ncollected her strength to go to her room, leaning on her daughter and\nCelestine.\n\n\"What is the meaning of all this?\" cried Lisbeth, left alone with\nVictorin.\n\nThe lawyer stood rigid, in very natural dismay, and did not hear her.\n\n\"What is the matter, my dear Victorin?\"\n\n\"I am horrified!\" said he, and his face scowled darkly. \"Woe to anybody\nwho hurts my mother! I have no scruples then. I would crush that woman\nlike a viper if I could!--What, does she attack my mother's life, my\nmother's honor?\"\n\n\"She said, but do not repeat it, my dear Victorin--she said you should\nall fall lower even than your father. And she scolded Crevel roundly\nfor not having shut your mouths with this secret that seems to be such a\nterror to Adeline.\"\n\nA doctor was sent for, for the Baroness was evidently worse. He gave\nher a draught containing a large dose of opium, and Adeline, having\nswallowed it, fell into a deep sleep; but the whole family were greatly\nalarmed.\n\nEarly next morning Victorin went out, and on his way to the Courts\ncalled at the Prefecture of the Police, where he begged Vautrin, the\nhead of the detective department, to send him Madame de Saint-Esteve.\n\n\"We are forbidden, monsieur, to meddle in your affairs; but Madame de\nSaint-Esteve is in business, and will attend to your orders,\" replied\nthis famous police officer.\n\nOn his return home, the unhappy lawyer was told that his mother's reason\nwas in danger. Doctor Bianchon, Doctor Larabit, and Professor Angard\nhad met in consultation, and were prepared to apply heroic remedies to\nhinder the rush of blood to the head. At the moment when Victorin was\nlistening to Doctor Bianchon, who was giving him, at some length, his\nreasons for hoping that the crisis might be got over, the man-servant\nannounced that a client, Madame de Saint-Esteve, was waiting to see him.\nVictorin left Bianchon in the middle of a sentence and flew downstairs\nlike a madman.\n\n\"Is there any hereditary lunacy in the family?\" said Bianchon,\naddressing Larabit.\n\nThe doctors departed, leaving a hospital attendant, instructed by them,\nto watch Madame Hulot.\n\n\"A whole life of virtue!----\" was the only sentence the sufferer had\nspoken since the attack.\n\nLisbeth never left Adeline's bedside; she sat up all night, and was much\nadmired by the two younger women.\n\n\"Well, my dear Madame de Saint-Esteve,\" said Victorin, showing the\ndreadful old woman into his study and carefully shutting the doors, \"how\nare we getting on?\"\n\n\"Ah, ha! my dear friend,\" said she, looking at Victorin with cold irony.\n\"So you have thought things over?\"\n\n\"Have you done anything?\"\n\n\"Will you pay fifty thousand francs?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Victorin, \"for we must get on. Do you know that by one\nsingle phrase that woman has endangered my mother's life and reason? So,\nI say, get on.\"\n\n\"We have got on!\" replied the old woman.\n\n\"Well?\" cried Victorin, with a gulp.\n\n\"Well, you do not cry off the expenses?\"\n\n\"On the contrary.\"\n\n\"They run up to twenty-three thousand francs already.\"\n\nVictorin looked helplessly at the woman.\n\n\"Well, could we hoodwink you, you, one of the shining lights of the\nlaw?\" said she. \"For that sum we have secured a maid's conscience and a\npicture by Raphael.--It is not dear.\"\n\nHulot, still bewildered, sat with wide open eyes.\n\n\"Well, then,\" his visitor went on, \"we have purchased the honesty of\nMademoiselle Reine Tousard, a damsel from whom Madame Marneffe has no\nsecrets--\"\n\n\"I understand!\"\n\n\"But if you shy, say so.\"\n\n\"I will play blindfold,\" he replied. \"My mother has told me that that\ncouple deserve the worst torments--\"\n\n\"The rack is out of date,\" said the old woman.\n\n\"You answer for the result?\"\n\n\"Leave it all to me,\" said the woman; \"your vengeance is simmering.\"\n\nShe looked at the clock; it was six.\n\n\"Your avenger is dressing; the fires are lighted at the _Rocher de\nCancale_; the horses are pawing the ground; my irons are getting\nhot.--Oh, I know your Madame Marneffe by heart!--Everything is ready.\nAnd there are some boluses in the rat-trap; I will tell you to-morrow\nmorning if the mouse is poisoned. I believe she will be; good evening,\nmy son.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, madame.\"\n\n\"Do you know English?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, my son, thou shalt be King. That is to say, you shall come into\nyour inheritance,\" said the dreadful old witch, foreseen by Shakespeare,\nand who seemed to know her Shakespeare.\n\nShe left Hulot amazed at the door of his study.\n\n\"The consultation is for to-morrow!\" said she, with the gracious air of\na regular client.\n\nShe saw two persons coming, and wished to pass in their eyes a pinchbeck\ncountess.\n\n\"What impudence!\" thought Hulot, bowing to his pretended client.\n\n\n\nBaron Montes de Montejanos was a _lion_, but a lion not accounted\nfor. Fashionable Paris, Paris of the turf and of the town, admired\nthe ineffable waistcoats of this foreign gentleman, his spotless\npatent-leather boots, his incomparable sticks, his much-coveted horses,\nand the negro servants who rode the horses and who were entirely slaves\nand most consumedly thrashed.\n\nHis fortune was well known; he had a credit account up to seven hundred\nthousand francs in the great banking house of du Tillet; but he was\nalways seen alone. When he went to \"first nights,\" he was in a stall. He\nfrequented no drawing-rooms. He had never given his arm to a girl on the\nstreets. His name would not be coupled with that of any pretty woman\nof the world. To pass his time he played whist at the Jockey-Club. The\nworld was reduced to calumny, or, which it thought funnier, to laughing\nat his peculiarities; he went by the name of Combabus.\n\nBixiou, Leon de Lora, Lousteau, Florine, Mademoiselle Heloise Brisetout,\nand Nathan, supping one evening with the notorious Carabine, with a\nlarge party of _lions_ and _lionesses_, had invented this name with an\nexcessively burlesque explanation. Massol, as being on the Council of\nState, and Claude Vignon, erewhile Professor of Greek, had related to\nthe ignorant damsels the famous anecdote, preserved in Rollin's _Ancient\nHistory_, concerning Combabus, that voluntary Abelard who was placed in\ncharge of the wife of a King of Assyria, Persia, Bactria, Mesopotamia,\nand other geographical divisions peculiar to old Professor du Bocage,\nwho continued the work of d'Anville, the creator of the East of\nantiquity. This nickname, which gave Carabine's guests laughter for a\nquarter of an hour, gave rise to a series of over-free jests, to which\nthe Academy could not award the Montyon prize; but among which the name\nwas taken up, to rest thenceforth on the curly mane of the handsome\nBaron, called by Josepha the splendid Brazilian--as one might say a\nsplendid _Catoxantha_.\n\nCarabine, the loveliest of her tribe, whose delicate beauty and amusing\nwit had snatched the sceptre of the Thirteenth Arrondissement from\nthe hands of Mademoiselle Turquet, better known by the name of\nMalaga--Mademoiselle Seraphine Sinet (this was her real name) was to du\nTillet the banker what Josepha Mirah was to the Duc d'Herouville.\n\nNow, on the morning of the very day when Madame de Saint-Esteve had\nprophesied success to Victorin, Carabine had said to du Tillet at about\nseven o'clock:\n\n\"If you want to be very nice, you will give me a dinner at the _Rocher\nde Cancale_ and bring Combabus. We want to know, once for all, whether\nhe has a mistress.--I bet that he has, and I should like to win.\"\n\n\"He is still at the Hotel des Princes; I will call,\" replied du Tillet.\n\"We will have some fun. Ask all the youngsters--the youngster Bixiou,\nthe youngster Lora, in short, all the clan.\"\n\nAt half-past seven that evening, in the handsomest room of the\nrestaurant where all Europe has dined, a splendid silver service was\nspread, made on purpose for entertainments where vanity pays the bill\nin bank-notes. A flood of light fell in ripples on the chased rims;\nwaiters, whom a provincial might have taken for diplomatists but for\ntheir age, stood solemnly, as knowing themselves to be overpaid.\n\nFive guests had arrived, and were waiting for nine more. These were\nfirst and foremost Bixiou, still flourishing in 1843, the salt of every\nintellectual dish, always supplied with fresh wit--a phenomenon as rare\nin Paris as virtue is; Leon de Lora, the greatest living painter of\nlandscape and the sea who has this great advantage over all his rivals,\nthat he has never fallen below his first successes. The courtesans could\nnever dispense with these two kings of ready wit. No supper, no dinner,\nwas possible without them.\n\nSeraphine Sinet, _dite_ Carabine, as the mistress _en titre_ of the\nAmphitryon, was one of the first to arrive; and the brilliant lighting\nshowed off her shoulders, unrivaled in Paris, her throat, as round as if\nturned in a lathe, without a crease, her saucy face, and dress of satin\nbrocade in two shades of blue, trimmed with Honiton lace enough to have\nfed a whole village for a month.\n\nPretty Jenny Cadine, not acting that evening, came in a dress of\nincredible splendor; her portrait is too well known to need any\ndescription. A party is always a Longchamps of evening dress for these\nladies, each anxious to win the prize for her millionaire by thus\nannouncing to her rivals:\n\n\"This is the price I am worth!\"\n\nA third woman, evidently at the initial stage of her career, gazed,\nalmost shamefaced, at the luxury of her two established and wealthy\ncompanions. Simply dressed in white cashmere trimmed with blue, her head\nhad been dressed with real flowers by a coiffeur of the old-fashioned\nschool, whose awkward hands had unconsciously given the charm of\nineptitude to her fair hair. Still unaccustomed to any finery, she\nshowed the timidity--to use a hackneyed phrase--inseparable from a first\nappearance. She had come from Valognes to find in Paris some use for\nher distracting youthfulness, her innocence that might have stirred the\nsenses of a dying man, and her beauty, worthy to hold its own with any\nthat Normandy has ever supplied to the theatres of the capital. The\nlines of that unblemished face were the ideal of angelic purity. Her\nmilk-white skin reflected the light like a mirror. The delicate pink\nin her cheeks might have been laid on with a brush. She was called\nCydalise, and, as will be seen, she was an important pawn in the game\nplayed by Ma'ame Nourrisson to defeat Madame Marneffe.\n\n\"Your arm is not a match for your name, my child,\" said Jenny Cadine, to\nwhom Carabine had introduced this masterpiece of sixteen, having brought\nher with her.\n\nAnd, in fact, Cydalise displayed to public admiration a fine pair of\narms, smooth and satiny, but red with healthy young blood.\n\n\"What do you want for her?\" said Jenny Cadine, in an undertone to\nCarabine.\n\n\"A fortune.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do with her?\"\n\n\"Well--Madame Combabus!\"\n\n\"And what are you to get for such a job?\"\n\n\"Guess.\"\n\n\"A service of plate?\"\n\n\"I have three.\"\n\n\"Diamonds?\"\n\n\"I am selling them.\"\n\n\"A green monkey?\"\n\n\"No. A picture by Raphael.\"\n\n\"What maggot is that in your brain?\"\n\n\"Josepha makes me sick with her pictures,\" said Carabine. \"I want some\nbetter than hers.\"\n\nDu Tillet came with the Brazilian, the hero of the feast; the Duc\nd'Herouville followed with Josepha. The singer wore a plain velvet gown,\nbut she had on a necklace worth a hundred and twenty thousand francs,\npearls hardly distinguishable from her skin like white camellia petals.\nShe had stuck one scarlet camellia in her black hair--a patch--the\neffect was dazzling, and she had amused herself by putting eleven rows\nof pearls on each arm. As she shook hands with Jenny Cadine, the actress\nsaid, \"Lend me your mittens!\"\n\nJosepha unclasped them one by one and handed them to her friend on a\nplate.\n\n\"There's style!\" said Carabine. \"Quite the Duchess! You have robbed the\nocean to dress the nymph, Monsieur le Duc,\" she added turning to the\nlittle Duc d'Herouville.\n\nThe actress took two of the bracelets; she clasped the other twenty on\nthe singer's beautiful arms, which she kissed.\n\nLousteau, the literary cadger, la Palferine and Malaga, Massol,\nVauvinet, and Theodore Gaillard, a proprietor of one of the most\nimportant political newspapers, completed the party. The Duc\nd'Herouville, polite to everybody, as a fine gentleman knows how to be,\ngreeted the Comte de la Palferine with the particular nod which, while\nit does not imply either esteem or intimacy, conveys to all the world,\n\"We are of the same race, the same blood--equals!\"--And this greeting,\nthe shibboleth of the aristocracy, was invented to be the despair of the\nupper citizen class.\n\nCarabine placed Combabus on her left, and the Duc d'Herouville on her\nright. Cydalise was next to the Brazilian, and beyond her was Bixiou.\nMalaga sat by the Duke.\n\nOysters appeared at seven o'clock; at eight they were drinking iced\npunch. Every one is familiar with the bill of fare of such a banquet. By\nnine o'clock they were talking as people talk after forty-two bottles of\nvarious wines, drunk by fourteen persons. Dessert was on the table, the\nodious dessert of the month of April. Of all the party, the only one\naffected by the heady atmosphere was Cydalise, who was humming a tune.\nNone of the party, with the exception of the poor country girl, had lost\ntheir reason; the drinkers and the women were the experienced _elite_ of\nthe society that sups. Their wits were bright, their eyes glistened,\nbut with no loss of intelligence, though the talk drifted into satire,\nanecdote, and gossip. Conversation, hitherto confined to the inevitable\ncircle of racing, horses, hammerings on the Bourse, the different\noccupations of the _lions_ themselves, and the scandals of the town,\nshowed a tendency to break up into intimate _tete-a-tete_, the dialogues\nof two hearts.\n\nAnd at this stage, at a signal from Carabine to Leon de Lora, Bixiou, la\nPalferine, and du Tillet, love came under discussion.\n\n\"A doctor in good society never talks of medicine, true nobles never\nspeak of their ancestors, men of genius do not discuss their works,\"\nsaid Josepha; \"why should we talk business? If I got the opera put off\nin order to dine here, it was assuredly not to work.--So let us change\nthe subject, dear children.\"\n\n\"But we are speaking of real love, my beauty,\" said Malaga, \"of the\nlove that makes a man fling all to the dogs--father, mother, wife,\nchildren--and retire to Clichy.\"\n\n\"Talk away, then, 'don't know yer,'\" said the singer.\n\nThe slang words, borrowed from the Street Arab, and spoken by these\nwomen, may be a poem on their lips, helped by the expression of the eyes\nand face.\n\n\"What, do not I love you, Josepha?\" said the Duke in a low voice.\n\n\"You, perhaps, may love me truly,\" said she in his ear, and she smiled.\n\"But I do not love you in the way they describe, with such love as makes\nthe world dark in the absence of the man beloved. You are delightful\nto me, useful--but not indispensable; and if you were to throw me over\nto-morrow, I could have three dukes for one.\"\n\n\"Is true love to be found in Paris?\" asked Leon de Lora. \"Men have not\neven time to make a fortune; how can they give themselves over to true\nlove, which swamps a man as water melts sugar? A man must be enormously\nrich to indulge in it, for love annihilates him--for instance, like\nour Brazilian friend over there. As I said long ago, 'Extremes\ndefeat--themselves.' A true lover is like an eunuch; women have ceased\nto exist for him. He is mystical; he is like the true Christian, an\nanchorite of the desert!--See our noble Brazilian.\"\n\nEvery one at table looked at Henri Montes de Montejanos, who was shy at\nfinding every eye centred on him.\n\n\"He has been feeding there for an hour without discovering, any more\nthan an ox at pasture, that he is sitting next to--I will not say, in\nsuch company, the loveliest--but the freshest woman in all Paris.\"\n\n\"Everything is fresh here, even the fish; it is what the house is famous\nfor,\" said Carabine.\n\nBaron Montes looked good-naturedly at the painter, and said:\n\n\"Very good! I drink to your very good health,\" and bowing to Leon de\nLora, he lifted his glass of port wine and drank it with much dignity.\n\n\"Are you then truly in love?\" asked Malaga of her neighbor, thus\ninterpreting his toast.\n\nThe Brazilian refilled his glass, bowed to Carabine, and drank again.\n\n\"To the lady's health then!\" said the courtesan, in such a droll tone\nthat Lora, du Tillet, and Bixiou burst out laughing.\n\nThe Brazilian sat like a bronze statue. This impassibility provoked\nCarabine. She knew perfectly well that Montes was devoted to Madame\nMarneffe, but she had not expected this dogged fidelity, this obstinate\nsilence of conviction.\n\nA woman is as often gauged by the attitude of her lover as a man\nis judged from the tone of his mistress. The Baron was proud of his\nattachment to Valerie, and of hers to him; his smile had, to these\nexperienced connoisseurs, a touch of irony; he was really grand to look\nupon; wine had not flushed him; and his eyes, with their peculiar lustre\nas of tarnished gold, kept the secrets of his soul. Even Carabine said\nto herself:\n\n\"What a woman she must be! How she has sealed up that heart!\"\n\n\"He is a rock!\" said Bixiou in an undertone, imagining that the whole\nthing was a practical joke, and never suspecting the importance to\nCarabine of reducing this fortress.\n\nWhile this conversation, apparently so frivolous, was going on at\nCarabine's right, the discussion of love was continued on her left\nbetween the Duc d'Herouville, Lousteau, Josepha, Jenny Cadine, and\nMassol. They were wondering whether such rare phenomena were the result\nof passion, obstinacy, or affection. Josepha, bored to death by it all,\ntried to change the subject.\n\n\"You are talking of what you know nothing about. Is there a man among\nyou who ever loved a woman--a woman beneath him--enough to squander his\nfortune and his children's, to sacrifice his future and blight his past,\nto risk going to the hulks for robbing the Government, to kill an uncle\nand a brother, to let his eye be so effectually blinded that he did\nnot even perceive that it was done to hinder his seeing the abyss into\nwhich, as a crowning jest, he was being driven? Du Tillet has a cash-box\nunder his left breast; Leon de Lora has his wit; Bixiou would laugh\nat himself for a fool if he loved any one but himself; Massol has a\nminister's portfolio in the place of a heart; Lousteau can have nothing\nbut viscera, since he could endure to be thrown over by Madame de\nBaudraye; Monsieur le Duc is too rich to prove his love by his ruin;\nVauvinet is not in it--I do not regard a bill-broker as one of the human\nrace; and you have never loved, nor I, nor Jenny Cadine, nor Malaga. For\nmy part, I never but once even saw the phenomenon I have described. It\nwas,\" and she turned to Jenny Cadine, \"that poor Baron Hulot, whom I am\ngoing to advertise for like a lost dog, for I want to find him.\"\n\n\"Oh, ho!\" said Carabine to herself, and looking keenly at Josepha, \"then\nMadame Nourrisson has two pictures by Raphael, since Josepha is playing\nmy hand!\"\n\n\"Poor fellow,\" said Vauvinet, \"he was a great man! Magnificent! And what\na figure, what a style, the air of Francis I.! What a volcano! and how\nfull of ingenious ways of getting money! He must be looking for it now,\nwherever he is, and I make no doubt he extracts it even from the walls\nbuilt of bones that you may see in the suburbs of Paris near the city\ngates--\"\n\n\"And all that,\" said Bixiou, \"for that little Madame Marneffe! There is\na precious hussy for you!\"\n\n\"She is just going to marry my friend Crevel,\" said du Tillet.\n\n\"And she is madly in love with my friend Steinbock,\" Leon de Lora put\nin.\n\nThese three phrases were like so many pistol-shots fired point-blank at\nMontes. He turned white, and the shock was so painful that he rose with\ndifficulty.\n\n\"You are a set of blackguards!\" cried he. \"You have no right to speak\nthe name of an honest woman in the same breath with those fallen\ncreatures--above all, not to make it a mark for your slander!\"\n\nHe was interrupted by unanimous bravos and applause. Bixiou, Leon de\nLora, Vauvinet, du Tillet, and Massol set the example, and there was a\nchorus.\n\n\"Hurrah for the Emperor!\" said Bixiou.\n\n\"Crown him! crown him!\" cried Vauvinet.\n\n\"Three groans for such a good dog! Hurrah for Brazil!\" cried Lousteau.\n\n\"So, my copper-colored Baron, it is our Valerie that you love; and you\nare not disgusted?\" said Leon de Lora.\n\n\"His remark is not parliamentary, but it is grand!\" observed Massol.\n\n\"But, my most delightful customer,\" said du Tillet, \"you were\nrecommended to me; I am your banker; your innocence reflects on my\ncredit.\"\n\n\"Yes, tell me, you are a reasonable creature----\" said the Brazilian to\nthe banker.\n\n\"Thanks on behalf of the company,\" said Bixiou with a bow.\n\n\"Tell me the real facts,\" Montes went on, heedless of Bixiou's\ninterjection.\n\n\"Well, then,\" replied du Tillet, \"I have the honor to tell you that I am\nasked to the Crevel wedding.\"\n\n\"Ah, ha! Combabus holds a brief for Madame Marneffe!\" said Josepha,\nrising solemnly.\n\nShe went round to Montes with a tragic look, patted him kindly on the\nhead, looked at him for a moment with comical admiration, and nodded\nsagely.\n\n\"Hulot was the first instance of love through fire and water,\" said she;\n\"this is the second. But it ought not to count, as it comes from the\nTropics.\"\n\nMontes had dropped into his chair again, when Josepha gently touched his\nforehead, and looked at du Tillet as he said:\n\n\"If I am the victim of a Paris jest, if you only wanted to get at my\nsecret----\" and he sent a flashing look round the table, embracing all\nthe guests in a flaming glance that blazed with the sun of Brazil,--\"I\nbeg of you as a favor to tell me so,\" he went on, in a tone of almost\nchildlike entreaty; \"but do not vilify the woman I love.\"\n\n\"Nay, indeed,\" said Carabine in a low voice; \"but if, on the contrary,\nyou are shamefully betrayed, cheated, tricked by Valerie, if I should\ngive you the proof in an hour, in my own house, what then?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you before all these Iagos,\" said the Brazilian.\n\nCarabine understood him to say _magots_ (baboons).\n\n\"Well, well, say no more!\" she replied, smiling. \"Do not make yourself\na laughing-stock for all the wittiest men in Paris; come to my house, we\nwill talk it over.\"\n\nMontes was crushed. \"Proofs,\" he stammered, \"consider--\"\n\n\"Only too many,\" replied Carabine; \"and if the mere suspicion hits you\nso hard, I fear for your reason.\"\n\n\"Is this creature obstinate, I ask you? He is worse than the late\nlamented King of Holland!--I say, Lousteau, Bixiou, Massol, all the crew\nof you, are you not invited to breakfast with Madame Marneffe the day\nafter to-morrow?\" said Leon de Lora.\n\n\"_Ya_,\" said du Tillet; \"I have the honor of assuring you, Baron, that\nif you had by any chance thought of marrying Madame Marneffe, you are\nthrown out like a bill in Parliament, beaten by a blackball called\nCrevel. My friend, my old comrade Crevel, has eighty thousand francs a\nyear; and you, I suppose, did not show such a good hand, for if you had,\nyou, I imagine, would have been preferred.\"\n\nMontes listened with a half-absent, half-smiling expression, which\nstruck them all with terror.\n\nAt this moment the head-waiter came to whisper to Carabine that a lady,\na relation of hers, was in the drawing-room and wished to speak to her.\n\nCarabine rose and went out to find Madame Nourrisson, decently veiled\nwith black lace.\n\n\"Well, child, am I to go to your house? Has he taken the hook?\"\n\n\"Yes, mother; and the pistol is so fully loaded, that my only fear is\nthat it will burst,\" said Carabine.\n\nAbout an hour later, Montes, Cydalise, and Carabine, returning from the\n_Rocher de Cancale_, entered Carabine's little sitting-room in the Rue\nSaint-Georges. Madame Nourrisson was sitting in an armchair by the fire.\n\n\"Here is my worthy old aunt,\" said Carabine.\n\n\"Yes, child, I came in person to fetch my little allowance. You would\nhave forgotten me, though you are kind-hearted, and I have some bills\nto pay to-morrow. Buying and selling clothes, I am always short of cash.\nWho is this at your heels? The gentleman looks very much put out about\nsomething.\"\n\nThe dreadful Madame Nourrisson, at this moment so completely disguised\nas to look like a respectable old body, rose to embrace Carabine, one of\nthe hundred and odd courtesans she had launched on their horrible career\nof vice.\n\n\"He is an Othello who is not to be taken in, whom I have the honor of\nintroducing to you--Monsieur le Baron Montes de Montejanos.\"\n\n\"Oh! I have heard him talked about, and know his name.--You are\nnicknamed Combabus, because you love but one woman, and in Paris, that\nis the same as loving no one at all. And is it by chance the object of\nyour affections who is fretting you? Madame Marneffe, Crevel's woman? I\ntell you what, my dear sir, you may bless your stars instead of cursing\nthem. She is a good-for-nothing baggage, is that little woman. I know\nher tricks!\"\n\n\"Get along,\" said Carabine, into whose hand Madame Nourrisson had\nslipped a note while embracing her, \"you do not know your Brazilians.\nThey are wrong-headed creatures that insist on being impaled through\nthe heart. The more jealous they are, the more jealous they want to\nbe. Monsieur talks of dealing death all round, but he will kill nobody\nbecause he is in love.--However, I have brought him here to give him\nthe proofs of his discomfiture, which I have got from that little\nSteinbock.\"\n\nMontes was drunk; he listened as if the women were talking about\nsomebody else.\n\nCarabine went to take off her velvet wrap, and read a facsimile of a\nnote, as follows:--\n\n  \"DEAR PUSS.--He dines with Popinot this evening, and will come\n  to fetch me from the Opera at eleven. I shall go out at about\n  half-past five and count on finding you at our paradise. Order\n  dinner to be sent in from the _Maison d'or_. Dress, so as to be\n  able to take me to the Opera. We shall have four hours to ourselves.\n  Return this note to me; not that your Valerie doubts you--I would\n  give you my life, my fortune, and my honor, but I am afraid of the\n  tricks of chance.\"\n\n\"Here, Baron, this is the note sent to Count Steinbock this morning;\nread the address. The original document is burnt.\"\n\nMontes turned the note over and over, recognized the writing, and was\nstruck by a rational idea, which is sufficient evidence of the disorder\nof his brain.\n\n\"And, pray,\" said he, looking at Carabine, \"what object have you in\ntorturing my heart, for you must have paid very dear for the\nprivilege of having the note in your possession long enough to get it\nlithographed?\"\n\n\"Foolish man!\" said Carabine, at a nod from Madame Nourrisson, \"don't\nyou see that poor child Cydalise--a girl of sixteen, who has been pining\nfor you these three months, till she has lost her appetite for food or\ndrink, and who is heart-broken because you have never even glanced at\nher?\"\n\nCydalise put her handkerchief to her eyes with an appearance of\nemotion--\"She is furious,\" Carabine went on, \"though she looks as if\nbutter would not melt in her mouth, furious to see the man she adores\nduped by a villainous hussy; she would kill Valerie--\"\n\n\"Oh, as for that,\" said the Brazilian, \"that is my business!\"\n\n\"What, killing?\" said old Nourrisson. \"No, my son, we don't do that here\nnowadays.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Montes, \"I am not a native of this country. I live in a\nparish where I can laugh at your laws; and if you give me proof--\"\n\n\"Well, that note. Is that nothing?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Brazilian. \"I do not believe in the writing. I must see\nfor myself.\"\n\n\"See!\" cried Carabine, taking the hint at once from a gesture of her\nsupposed aunt. \"You shall see, my dear Tiger, all you wish to see--on\none condition.\"\n\n\"And that is?\"\n\n\"Look at Cydalise.\"\n\nAt a wink from Madame Nourrisson, Cydalise cast a tender look at the\nBaron.\n\n\"Will you be good to her? Will you make her a home?\" asked Carabine. \"A\ngirl of such beauty is well worth a house and a carriage! It would be a\nmonstrous shame to leave her to walk the streets. And besides--she is in\ndebt.--How much do you owe?\" asked Carabine, nipping Cydalise's arm.\n\n\"She is worth all she can get,\" said the old woman. \"The point is that\nshe can find a buyer.\"\n\n\"Listen!\" cried Montes, fully aware at last of this masterpiece of\nwomankind \"you will show me Valerie--\"\n\n\"And Count Steinbock.--Certainly!\" said Madame Nourrisson.\n\nFor the past ten minutes the old woman had been watching the Brazilian;\nshe saw that he was an instrument tuned up to the murderous pitch she\nneeded; and, above all, so effectually blinded, that he would never heed\nwho had led him on to it, and she spoke:--\n\n\"Cydalise, my Brazilian jewel, is my niece, so her concerns are partly\nmine. All this catastrophe will be the work of a few minutes, for a\nfriend of mine lets the furnished room to Count Steinbock where Valerie\nis at this moment taking coffee--a queer sort of coffee, but she calls\nit her coffee. So let us understand each other, Brazil!--I like Brazil,\nit is a hot country.--What is to become of my niece?\"\n\n\"You old ostrich,\" said Montes, the plumes in the woman's bonnet\ncatching his eye, \"you interrupted me.--If you show me--if I see Valerie\nand that artist together--\"\n\n\"As you would wish to be--\" said Carabine; \"that is understood.\"\n\n\"Then I will take this girl and carry her away--\"\n\n\"Where?\" asked Carabine.\n\n\"To Brazil,\" replied the Baron. \"I will make her my wife. My uncle left\nme ten leagues square of entailed estate; that is how I still have\nthat house and home. I have a hundred negroes--nothing but negroes and\nnegresses and negro brats, all bought by my uncle--\"\n\n\"Nephew to a nigger-driver,\" said Carabine, with a grimace. \"That needs\nsome consideration.--Cydalise, child, are you fond of the blacks?\"\n\n\"Pooh! Carabine, no nonsense,\" said the old woman. \"The deuce is in it!\nMonsieur and I are doing business.\"\n\n\"If I take up another Frenchwoman, I mean to have her to myself,\" the\nBrazilian went on. \"I warn you, mademoiselle, I am king there, and not a\nconstitutional king. I am Czar; my subjects are mine by purchase, and\nno one can escape from my kingdom, which is a hundred leagues from any\nhuman settlement, hemmed in by savages on the interior, and divided from\nthe sea by a wilderness as wide as France.\"\n\n\"I should prefer a garret here.\"\n\n\"So thought I,\" said Montes, \"since I sold all my land and possessions\nat Rio to come back to Madame Marneffe.\"\n\n\"A man does not make such a voyage for nothing,\" remarked Madame\nNourrisson. \"You have a right to look for love for your own sake,\nparticularly being so good-looking.--Oh, he is very handsome!\" said she\nto Carabine.\n\n\"Very handsome, handsomer than the _Postillon de Longjumeau_,\" replied\nthe courtesan.\n\nCydalise took the Brazilian's hand, but he released it as politely as he\ncould.\n\n\"I came back for Madame Marneffe,\" the man went on where he had left\noff, \"but you do not know why I was three years thinking about it.\"\n\n\"No, savage!\" said Carabine.\n\n\"Well, she had so repeatedly told me that she longed to live with me\nalone in a desert--\"\n\n\"Oh, ho! he is not a savage after all,\" cried Carabine, with a shout of\nlaughter. \"He is of the highly-civilized tribe of Flats!\"\n\n\"She had told me this so often,\" Montes went on, regardless of the\ncourtesan's mockery, \"that I had a lovely house fitted up in the heart\nof that vast estate. I came back to France to fetch Valerie, and the\nfirst evening I saw her--\"\n\n\"Saw her is very proper!\" said Carabine. \"I will remember it.\"\n\n\"She told me to wait till that wretched Marneffe was dead; and I agreed,\nand forgave her for having admitted the attentions of Hulot. Whether the\ndevil had her in hand I don't know, but from that instant that woman\nhas humored my every whim, complied with all my demands--never for one\nmoment has she given me cause to suspect her!--\"\n\n\"That is supremely clever!\" said Carabine to Madame Nourrisson, who\nnodded in sign of assent.\n\n\"My faith in that woman,\" said Montes, and he shed a tear, \"was a match\nfor my love. Just now, I was ready to fight everybody at table--\"\n\n\"So I saw,\" said Carabine.\n\n\"And if I am cheated, if she is going to be married, if she is at this\nmoment in Steinbock's arms, she deserves a thousand deaths! I will kill\nher as I would smash a fly--\"\n\n\"And how about the gendarmes, my son?\" said Madame Nourrisson, with a\nsmile that made your flesh creep.\n\n\"And the police agents, and the judges, and the assizes, and all the\nset-out?\" added Carabine.\n\n\"You are bragging, my dear fellow,\" said the old woman, who wanted to\nknow all the Brazilian's schemes of vengeance.\n\n\"I will kill her,\" he calmly repeated. \"You called me a savage.--Do you\nimagine that I am fool enough to go, like a Frenchman, and buy poison\nat the chemist's shop?--During the time while we were driving her, I\nthought out my means of revenge, if you should prove to be right as\nconcerns Valerie. One of my negroes has the most deadly of animal\npoisons, and incurable anywhere but in Brazil. I will administer it\nto Cydalise, who will give it to me; then by the time when death is a\ncertainty to Crevel and his wife, I shall be beyond the Azores with your\ncousin, who will be cured, and I will marry her. We have our own little\ntricks, we savages!--Cydalise,\" said he, looking at the country girl,\n\"is the animal I need.--How much does she owe?\"\n\n\"A hundred thousand francs,\" said Cydalise.\n\n\"She says little--but to the purpose,\" said Carabine, in a low tone to\nMadame Nourrisson.\n\n\"I am going mad!\" cried the Brazilian, in a husky voice, dropping on to\na sofa. \"I shall die of this! But I must see, for it is impossible!--A\nlithographed note! What is to assure me that it is not a forgery?--Baron\nHulot was in love with Valerie?\" said he, recalling Josepha's harangue.\n\"Nay; the proof that he did not love is that she is still alive--I will\nnot leave her living for anybody else, if she is not wholly mine.\"\n\nMontes was terrible to behold. He bellowed, he stormed; he broke\neverything he touched; rosewood was as brittle as glass.\n\n\"How he destroys things!\" said Carabine, looking at the old woman. \"My\ngood boy,\" said she, giving the Brazilian a little slap, \"Roland the\nFurious is very fine in a poem; but in a drawing-room he is prosaic and\nexpensive.\"\n\n\"My son,\" said old Nourrisson, rising to stand in front of the\ncrestfallen Baron, \"I am of your way of thinking. When you love in that\nway, and are joined 'till death does you part,' life must answer for\nlove. The one who first goes, carries everything away; it is a general\nwreck. You command my esteem, my admiration, my consent, especially for\nyour inoculation, which will make me a Friend of the Negro.--But you\nlove her! You will hark back?\"\n\n\"I?--If she is so infamous, I--\"\n\n\"Well, come now, you are talking too much, it strikes me. A man who\nmeans to be avenged, and who says he has the ways and means of a savage,\ndoesn't do that.--If you want to see your 'object' in her paradise, you\nmust take Cydalise and walk straight in with her on your arm, as if the\nservant had made a mistake. But no scandal! If you mean to be revenged,\nyou must eat the leek, seem to be in despair, and allow her to bully\nyou.--Do you see?\" said Madame Nourrisson, finding the Brazilian quite\namazed by so subtle a scheme.\n\n\"All right, old ostrich,\" he replied. \"Come along: I understand.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, little one!\" said the old woman to Carabine.\n\nShe signed to Cydalise to go on with Montes, and remained a minute with\nCarabine.\n\n\"Now, child, I have but one fear, and that is that he will strangle\nher! I should be in a very tight place; we must do everything gently.\nI believe you have won your picture by Raphael; but they tell me it is\nonly a Mignard. Never mind, it is much prettier; all the Raphaels are\ngone black, I am told, whereas this one is as bright as a Girodet.\"\n\n\"All I want is to crow over Josepha; and it is all the same to me\nwhether I have a Mignard or a Raphael!--That thief had on such pearls\nthis evening!--you would sell your soul for them.\"\n\nCydalise, Montes, and Madame Nourrisson got into a hackney coach that\nwas waiting at the door. Madame Nourrisson whispered to the driver the\naddress of a house in the same block as the Italian Opera House,\nwhich they could have reached in five or six minutes from the Rue\nSaint-Georges; but Madame Nourrisson desired the man to drive along the\nRue le Peletier, and to go very slowly, so as to be able to examine the\ncarriages in waiting.\n\n\"Brazilian,\" said the old woman, \"look out for your angel's carriage and\nservants.\"\n\nThe Baron pointed out Valerie's carriage as they passed it.\n\n\"She has told them to come for her at ten o'clock, and she is gone in a\ncab to the house where she visits Count Steinbock. She has dined there,\nand will come to the Opera in half an hour.--It is well contrived!\" said\nMadame Nourrisson. \"Thus you see how she has kept you so long in the\ndark.\"\n\nThe Brazilian made no reply. He had become the tiger, and had recovered\nthe imperturbable cool ferocity that had been so striking at dinner. He\nwas as calm as a bankrupt the day after he has stopped payment.\n\nAt the door of the house stood a hackney coach with two horses, of the\nkind known as a _Compagnie Generale_, from the Company that runs them.\n\n\"Stay here in the box,\" said the old woman to Montes. \"This is not an\nopen house like a tavern. I will send for you.\"\n\nThe paradise of Madame Marneffe and Wenceslas was not at all like that\nof Crevel--who, finding it useless now, had just sold his to the Comte\nMaxime de Trailles. This paradise, the paradise of all comers, consisted\nof a room on the fourth floor opening to the landing, in a house close\nto the Italian Opera. On each floor of this house there was a room which\nhad originally served as the kitchen to the apartments on that floor.\nBut the house having become a sort of inn, let out for clandestine love\naffairs at an exorbitant price, the owner, the real Madame Nourrisson,\nan old-clothes buyer in the Rue Nueve Saint-Marc, had wisely appreciated\nthe great value of these kitchens, and had turned them into a sort of\ndining-rooms. Each of these rooms, built between thick party-walls and\nwith windows to the street, was entirely shut in by very thick double\ndoors on the landing. Thus the most important secrets could be discussed\nover a dinner, with no risk of being overheard. For greater security,\nthe windows had shutters inside and out. These rooms, in consequence of\nthis peculiarity, were let for twelve hundred francs a month. The\nwhole house, full of such paradises and mysteries was rented by Madame\nNourrisson the First for twenty-eight thousand francs of clear profit,\nafter paying her housekeeper, Madame Nourrisson the Second, for she did\nnot manage it herself.\n\nThe paradise let to Count Steinbock had been hung with chintz; the\ncold, hard floor, of common tiles reddened with encaustic, was not\nfelt through a soft thick carpet. The furniture consisted of two pretty\nchairs and a bed in an alcove, just now half hidden by a table loaded\nwith the remains of an elegant dinner, while two bottles with long\nnecks and an empty champagne-bottle in ice strewed the field of bacchus\ncultivated by Venus.\n\nThere were also--the property, no doubt, of Valerie--a low easy-chair\nand a man's smoking-chair, and a pretty toilet chest of drawers in\nrosewood, the mirror handsomely framed _a la_ Pompadour. A lamp hanging\nfrom the ceiling gave a subdued light, increased by wax candles on the\ntable and on the chimney-shelf.\n\nThis sketch will suffice to give an idea, _urbi et orbi_, of clandestine\npassion in the squalid style stamped on it in Paris in 1840. How far,\nalas! from the adulterous love, symbolized by Vulcan's nets, three\nthousand years ago.\n\nWhen Montes and Cydalise came upstairs, Valerie, standing before the\nfire, where a log was blazing, was allowing Wenceslas to lace her stays.\n\nThis is a moment when a woman who is neither too fat nor too thin, but\nlike Valerie, elegant and slender, displays divine beauty. The rosy\nskin, mostly soft, invites the sleepiest eye. The lines of her figure,\nso little hidden, are so charmingly outlined by the white pleats of\nthe shift and the support of the stays, that she is irresistible--like\neverything that must be parted from.\n\nWith a happy face smiling at the glass, a foot impatiently marking\ntime, a hand put up to restore order among the tumbled curls, and eyes\nexpressive of gratitude; with the glow of satisfaction which, like a\nsunset, warms the least details of the countenance--everything makes\nsuch a moment a mine of memories.\n\nAny man who dares look back on the early errors of his life may,\nperhaps, recall some such reminiscences, and understand, though not\nexcuse, the follies of Hulot and Crevel. Women are so well aware of\ntheir power at such a moment, that they find in it what may be called\nthe aftermath of the meeting.\n\n\"Come, come; after two years' practice, you do not yet know how to lace\na woman's stays! You are too much a Pole!--There, it is ten o'clock, my\nWenceslas!\" said Valerie, laughing at him.\n\nAt this very moment, a mischievous waiting-woman, by inserting a knife,\npushed up the hook of the double doors that formed the whole security\nof Adam and Eve. She hastily pulled the door open--for the servants\nof these dens have little time to waste--and discovered one of the\nbewitching _tableaux de genre_ which Gavarni has so often shown at the\nSalon.\n\n\"In here, madame,\" said the girl; and Cydalise went in, followed by\nMontes.\n\n\"But there is some one here.--Excuse me, madame,\" said the country girl,\nin alarm.\n\n\"What?--Why! it is Valerie!\" cried Montes, violently slamming the door.\n\nMadame Marneffe, too genuinely agitated to dissemble her feelings,\ndropped on to the chair by the fireplace. Two tears rose to her eyes,\nand at once dried away. She looked at Montes, saw the girl, and burst\ninto a cackle of forced laughter. The dignity of the insulted woman\nredeemed the scantiness of her attire; she walked close up to the\nBrazilian, and looked at him so defiantly that her eyes glittered like\nknives.\n\n\"So that,\" said she, standing face to face with the Baron, and pointing\nto Cydalise--\"that is the other side of your fidelity? You, who have\nmade me promises that might convert a disbeliever in love! You, for\nwhom I have done so much--have even committed crimes!--You are right,\nmonsieur, I am not to compare with a child of her age and of such\nbeauty!\n\n\"I know what you are going to say,\" she went on, looking at Wenceslas,\nwhose undress was proof too clear to be denied. \"This is my concern. If\nI could love you after such gross treachery--for you have spied upon me,\nyou have paid for every step up these stairs, paid the mistress of the\nhouse, and the servant, perhaps even Reine--a noble deed!--If I had any\nremnant of affection for such a mean wretch, I could give him reasons\nthat would renew his passion!--But I leave you, monsieur, to your\ndoubts, which will become remorse.--Wenceslas, my gown!\"\n\nShe took her dress and put it on, looked at herself in the glass, and\nfinished dressing without heeding the Baron, as calmly as if she had\nbeen alone in the room.\n\n\"Wenceslas, are you ready?--Go first.\"\n\nShe had been watching Montes in the glass and out of the corner of\nher eye, and fancied she could see in his pallor an indication of the\nweakness which delivers a strong man over to a woman's fascinations; she\nnow took his hand, going so close to him that he could not help inhaling\nthe terrible perfumes which men love, and by which they intoxicate\nthemselves; then, feeling his pulses beat high, she looked at him\nreproachfully.\n\n\"You have my full permission to go and tell your history to Monsieur\nCrevel; he will never believe you. I have a perfect right to marry him,\nand he becomes my husband the day after to-morrow.--I shall make him\nvery happy.--Good-bye; try to forget me.\"\n\n\"Oh! Valerie,\" cried Henri Montes, clasping her in his arms, \"that is\nimpossible!--Come to Brazil!\"\n\nValerie looked in his face, and saw him her slave.\n\n\"Well, if you still love me, Henri, two years hence I will be your wife;\nbut your expression at this moment strikes me as very suspicious.\"\n\n\"I swear to you that they made me drink, that false friends threw this\ngirl on my hands, and that the whole thing is the outcome of chance!\"\nsaid Montes.\n\n\"Then I am to forgive you?\" she asked, with a smile.\n\n\"But you will marry, all the same?\" asked the Baron, in an agony of\njealousy.\n\n\"Eighty thousand francs a year!\" said she, with almost comical\nenthusiasm. \"And Crevel loves me so much that he will die of it!\"\n\n\"Ah! I understand,\" said Montes.\n\n\"Well, then, in a few days we will come to an understanding,\" said she.\n\nAnd she departed triumphant.\n\n\"I have no scruples,\" thought the Baron, standing transfixed for a few\nminutes. \"What! That woman believes she can make use of his passion to\nbe quit of that dolt, as she counted on Marneffe's decease!--I shall be\nthe instrument of divine wrath.\"\n\nTwo days later those of du Tillet's guests who had demolished Madame\nMarneffe tooth and nail, were seated round her table an hour after she\nhas shed her skin and changed her name for the illustrious name of\na Paris mayor. This verbal treason is one of the commonest forms of\nParisian levity.\n\nValerie had had the satisfaction of seeing the Brazilian in the church;\nfor Crevel, now so entirely the husband, had invited him out of bravado.\nAnd the Baron's presence at the breakfast astonished no one. All these\nmen of wit and of the world were familiar with the meanness of passion,\nthe compromises of pleasure.\n\nSteinbock's deep melancholy--for he was beginning to despise the woman\nwhom he had adored as an angel--was considered to be in excellent taste.\nThe Pole thus seemed to convey that all was at an end between Valerie\nand himself. Lisbeth came to embrace her dear Madame Crevel, and\nto excuse herself for not staying to the breakfast on the score of\nAdeline's sad state of health.\n\n\"Be quite easy,\" said she to Valerie, \"they will call on you, and\nyou will call on them. Simply hearing the words _two hundred thousand\nfrancs_ has brought the Baroness to death's door. Oh, you have them all\nhard and fast by that tale!--But you must tell it to me.\"\n\nWithin a month of her marriage, Valerie was at her tenth quarrel with\nSteinbock; he insisted on explanations as to Henri Montes, reminding her\nof the words spoken in their paradise; and, not content with speaking\nto her in terms of scorn, he watched her so closely that she never had a\nmoment of liberty, so much was she fettered by his jealousy on one side\nand Crevel's devotion on the other.\n\nBereft now of Lisbeth, whose advice had always been so valuable she flew\ninto such a rage as to reproach Wenceslas for the money she had lent\nhim. This so effectually roused Steinbock's pride, that he came no more\nto the Crevels' house. So Valerie had gained her point, which was to be\nrid of him for a time, and enjoy some freedom. She waited till Crevel\nshould make a little journey into the country to see Comte Popinot, with\na view to arranging for her introduction to the Countess, and was then\nable to make an appointment to meet the Baron, whom she wanted to have\nat her command for a whole day to give him those \"reasons\" which were to\nmake him love her more than ever.\n\nOn the morning of that day, Reine, who estimated the magnitude of her\ncrime by that of the bribe she received, tried to warn her mistress, in\nwhom she naturally took more interest than in strangers. Still, as she\nhad been threatened with madness, and ending her days in the Salpetriere\nin case of indiscretion, she was cautious.\n\n\"Madame, you are so well off now,\" said she. \"Why take on again with\nthat Brazilian?--I do not trust him at all.\"\n\n\"You are very right, Reine, and I mean to be rid of him.\"\n\n\"Oh, madame, I am glad to hear it; he frightens me, does that big Moor!\nI believe him to be capable of anything.\"\n\n\"Silly child! you have more reason to be afraid for him when he is with\nme.\"\n\nAt this moment Lisbeth came in.\n\n\"My dear little pet Nanny, what an age since we met!\" cried Valerie.\n\"I am so unhappy! Crevel bores me to death; and Wenceslas is gone--we\nquarreled.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Lisbeth, \"and that is what brings me here. Victorin\nmet him at about five in the afternoon going into an eating-house at\nfive-and-twenty sous, and he brought him home, hungry, by working on his\nfeelings, to the Rue Louis-le-Grand.--Hortense, seeing Wenceslas lean\nand ill and badly dressed, held out her hand. This is how you throw me\nover--\"\n\n\"Monsieur Henri, madame,\" the man-servant announced in a low voice to\nValerie.\n\n\"Leave me now, Lisbeth; I will explain it all to-morrow.\" But, as will\nbe seen, Valerie was ere long not in a state to explain anything to\nanybody.\n\n\n\nTowards the end of May, Baron Hulot's pension was released by Victorin's\nregular payment to Baron Nucingen. As everybody knows, pensions are\npaid half-yearly, and only on the presentation of a certificate that the\nrecipient is alive: and as Hulot's residence was unknown, the arrears\nunpaid on Vauvinet's demand remained to his credit in the Treasury.\nVauvinet now signed his renunciation of any further claims, and it was\nstill indispensable to find the pensioner before the arrears could be\ndrawn.\n\nThanks to Bianchon's care, the Baroness had recovered her health; and\nto this Josepha's good heart had contributed by a letter, of which the\northography betrayed the collaboration of the Duc d'Herouville. This\nwas what the singer wrote to the Baroness, after twenty days of anxious\nsearch:--\n\n  \"MADAME LA BARONNE,--Monsieur Hulot was living, two months since,\n  in the Rue des Bernardins, with Elodie Chardin, a lace-mender, for\n  whom he had left Mademoiselle Bijou; but he went away without a\n  word, leaving everything behind him, and no one knows where he\n  went. I am not without hope, however, and I have put a man on this\n  track who believes he has already seen him in the Boulevard\n  Bourdon.\n\n  \"The poor Jewess means to keep the promise she made to the\n  Christian. Will the angel pray for the devil? That must sometimes\n  happen in heaven.--I remain, with the deepest respect, always your\n  humble servant,\n\n  \"JOSEPHA MIRAH.\"\n\nThe lawyer, Maitre Hulot d'Ervy, hearing no more of the dreadful Madame\nNourrisson, seeing his father-in-law married, having brought back his\nbrother-in-law to the family fold, suffering from no importunity on\nthe part of his new stepmother, and seeing his mother's health improve\ndaily, gave himself up to his political and judicial duties, swept along\nby the tide of Paris life, in which the hours count for days.\n\nOne night, towards the end of the session, having occasion to write up\na report to the Chamber of Deputies, he was obliged to sit at work till\nlate at night. He had gone into his study at nine o'clock, and, while\nwaiting till the man-servant should bring in the candles with green\nshades, his thoughts turned to his father. He was blaming himself for\nleaving the inquiry so much to the singer, and had resolved to see\nMonsieur Chapuzot himself on the morrow, when he saw in the twilight,\noutside the window, a handsome old head, bald and yellow, with a fringe\nof white hair.\n\n\"Would you please to give orders, sir, that a poor hermit is to be\nadmitted, just come from the Desert, and who is instructed to beg for\ncontributions towards rebuilding a holy house.\"\n\nThis apparition, which suddenly reminded the lawyer of a prophecy\nuttered by the terrible Nourrisson, gave him a shock.\n\n\"Let in that old man,\" said he to the servant.\n\n\"He will poison the place, sir,\" replied the man. \"He has on a brown\ngown which he has never changed since he left Syria, and he has no\nshirt--\"\n\n\"Show him in,\" repeated the master.\n\nThe old man came in. Victorin's keen eye examined this so-called pilgrim\nhermit, and he saw a fine specimen of the Neapolitan friars, whose\nfrocks are akin to the rags of the _lazzaroni_, whose sandals are\ntatters of leather, as the friars are tatters of humanity. The get-up\nwas so perfect that the lawyer, though still on his guard, was vexed\nwith himself for having believed it to be one of Madame Nourrisson's\ntricks.\n\n\"How much to you want of me?\"\n\n\"Whatever you feel that you ought to give me.\"\n\nVictorin took a five-franc piece from a little pile on his table, and\nhanded it to the stranger.\n\n\"That is not much on account of fifty thousand francs,\" said the pilgrim\nof the desert.\n\nThis speech removed all Victorin's doubts.\n\n\"And has Heaven kept its word?\" he said, with a frown.\n\n\"The question is an offence, my son,\" said the hermit. \"If you do not\nchoose to pay till after the funeral, you are in your rights. I will\nreturn in a week's time.\"\n\n\"The funeral!\" cried the lawyer, starting up.\n\n\"The world moves on,\" said the old man, as he withdrew, \"and the dead\nmove quickly in Paris!\"\n\nWhen Hulot, who stood looking down, was about to reply, the stalwart old\nman had vanished.\n\n\"I don't understand one word of all this,\" said Victorin to himself.\n\"But at the end of the week I will ask him again about my father, if we\nhave not yet found him. Where does Madame Nourrisson--yes, that was her\nname--pick up such actors?\"\n\nOn the following day, Doctor Bianchon allowed the Baroness to go down\ninto the garden, after examining Lisbeth, who had been obliged to\nkeep to her room for a month by a slight bronchial attack. The learned\ndoctor, who dared not pronounce a definite opinion on Lisbeth's case\ntill he had seen some decisive symptoms, went into the garden with\nAdeline to observe the effect of the fresh air on her nervous trembling\nafter two months of seclusion. He was interested and allured by the hope\nof curing this nervous complaint. On seeing the great physician sitting\nwith them and sparing them a few minutes, the Baroness and her family\nconversed with him on general subjects.\n\n\"You life is a very full and a very sad one,\" said Madame Hulot. \"I\nknow what it is to spend one's days in seeing poverty and physical\nsuffering.\"\n\n\"I know, madame,\" replied the doctor, \"all the scenes of which charity\ncompels you to be a spectator; but you will get used to it in time, as\nwe all do. It is the law of existence. The confessor, the magistrate,\nthe lawyer would find life unendurable if the spirit of the State did\nnot assert itself above the feelings of the individual. Could we live at\nall but for that? Is not the soldier in time of war brought face to face\nwith spectacles even more dreadful than those we see? And every soldier\nthat has been under fire is kind-hearted. We medical men have the\npleasure now and again of a successful cure, as you have that of saving\na family from the horrors of hunger, depravity, or misery, and of\nrestoring it to social respectability. But what comfort can the\nmagistrate find, the police agent, or the attorney, who spend their\nlives in investigating the basest schemes of self-interest, the social\nmonster whose only regret is when it fails, but on whom repentance never\ndawns?\n\n\"One-half of society spends its life in watching the other half. A very\nold friend of mine is an attorney, now retired, who told me that for\nfifteen years past notaries and lawyers have distrusted their clients\nquite as much as their adversaries. Your son is a pleader; has he never\nfound himself compromised by the client for whom he held a brief?\"\n\n\"Very often,\" said Victorin, with a smile.\n\n\"And what is the cause of this deep-seated evil?\" asked the Baroness.\n\n\"The decay of religion,\" said Bianchon, \"and the pre-eminence of\nfinance, which is simply solidified selfishness. Money used not to\nbe everything; there were some kinds of superiority that ranked above\nit--nobility, genius, service done to the State. But nowadays the law\ntakes wealth as the universal standard, and regards it as the measure\nof public capacity. Certain magistrates are ineligible to the Chamber;\nJean-Jacques Rousseau would be ineligible! The perpetual subdivision of\nestate compels every man to take care of himself from the age of twenty.\n\n\"Well, then, between the necessity for making a fortune and the\ndepravity of speculation there is no check or hindrance; for the\nreligious sense is wholly lacking in France, in spite of the laudable\nendeavors of those who are working for a Catholic revival. And this is\nthe opinion of every man who, like me, studies society at the core.\"\n\n\"And you have few pleasures?\" said Hortense.\n\n\"The true physician, madame, is in love with his science,\" replied the\ndoctor. \"He is sustained by that passion as much as by the sense of his\nusefulness to society.\n\n\"At this very time you see in me a sort of scientific rapture, and many\nsuperficial judges would regard me as a man devoid of feeling. I have\nto announce a discovery to-morrow to the College of Medicine, for I am\nstudying a disease that had disappeared--a mortal disease for which no\ncure is known in temperate climates, though it is curable in the West\nIndies--a malady known here in the Middle Ages. A noble fight is that\nof the physician against such a disease. For the last ten days I have\nthought of nothing but these cases--for there are two, a husband and\nwife.--Are they not connections of yours? For you, madame, are surely\nMonsieur Crevel's daughter?\" said he, addressing Celestine.\n\n\"What, is my father your patient?\" asked Celestine. \"Living in the Rue\nBarbet-de-Jouy?\"\n\n\"Precisely so,\" said Bianchon.\n\n\"And the disease is inevitably fatal?\" said Victorin in dismay.\n\n\"I will go to see him,\" said Celestine, rising.\n\n\"I positively forbid it, madame,\" Bianchon quietly said. \"The disease is\ncontagious.\"\n\n\"But you go there, monsieur,\" replied the young woman. \"Do you think\nthat a daughter's duty is less binding than a doctor's?\"\n\n\"Madame, a physician knows how to protect himself against infection, and\nthe rashness of your devotion proves to me that you would probably be\nless prudent than I.\"\n\nCelestine, however, got up and went to her room, where she dressed to go\nout.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Victorin to Bianchon, \"have you any hope of saving\nMonsieur and Madame Crevel?\"\n\n\"I hope, but I do not believe that I may,\" said Bianchon. \"The case is\nto me quite inexplicable. The disease is peculiar to negroes and the\nAmerican tribes, whose skin is differently constituted to that of the\nwhite races. Now I can trace no connection with the copper-colored\ntribes, with negroes or half-castes, in Monsieur or Madame Crevel.\n\n\"And though it is a very interesting disease to us, it is a terrible\nthing for the sufferers. The poor woman, who is said to have been very\npretty, is punished for her sins, for she is now squalidly hideous if\nshe is still anything at all. She is losing her hair and teeth, her skin\nis like a leper's, she is a horror to herself; her hands are horrible,\ncovered with greenish pustules, her nails are loose, and the flesh is\neaten away by the poisoned humors.\"\n\n\"And the cause of such a disease?\" asked the lawyer.\n\n\"Oh!\" said the doctor, \"the cause lies in a form of rapid\nblood-poisoning; it degenerates with terrific rapidity. I hope to act on\nthe blood; I am having it analyzed; and I am now going home to ascertain\nthe result of the labors of my friend Professor Duval, the famous\nchemist, with a view to trying one of those desperate measures by which\nwe sometimes attempt to defeat death.\"\n\n\"The hand of God is there!\" said Adeline, in a voice husky with emotion.\n\"Though that woman has brought sorrows on me which have led me in\nmoments of madness to invoke the vengeance of Heaven, I hope--God knows\nI hope--you may succeed, doctor.\"\n\nVictorin felt dizzy. He looked at his mother, his sister, and the\nphysician by turns, quaking lest they should read his thoughts. He felt\nhimself a murderer.\n\nHortense, for her part, thought God was just.\n\nCelestine came back to beg her husband to accompany her.\n\n\"If you insist on going, madame, and you too, monsieur, keep at least\na foot between you and the bed of the sufferer, that is the chief\nprecaution. Neither you nor your wife must dream of kissing the dying\nman. And, indeed, you ought to go with your wife, Monsieur Hulot, to\nhinder her from disobeying my injunctions.\"\n\nAdeline and Hortense, when they were left alone, went to sit with\nLisbeth. Hortense had such a virulent hatred of Valerie that she could\nnot contain the expression of it.\n\n\"Cousin Lisbeth,\" she exclaimed, \"my mother and I are avenged! that\nvenomous snake is herself bitten--she is rotting in her bed!\"\n\n\"Hortense, at this moment you are not a Christian. You ought to pray to\nGod to vouchsafe repentance to this wretched woman.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" said Betty, rising from her couch. \"Are\nyou speaking of Valerie?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Adeline; \"she is past hope--dying of some horrible\ndisease of which the mere description makes one shudder----\"\n\nLisbeth's teeth chattered, a cold sweat broke out all over her; the\nviolence of the shock showed how passionate her attachment to Valerie\nhad been.\n\n\"I must go there,\" said she.\n\n\"But the doctor forbids your going out.\"\n\n\"I do not care--I must go!--Poor Crevel! what a state he must be in; for\nhe loves that woman.\"\n\n\"He is dying too,\" replied Countess Steinbock. \"Ah! all our enemies are\nin the devil's clutches--\"\n\n\"In God's hands, my child--\"\n\nLisbeth dressed in the famous yellow Indian shawl and her black velvet\nbonnet, and put on her boots; in spite of her relations' remonstrances,\nshe set out as if driven by some irresistible power.\n\nShe arrived in the Rue Barbet a few minutes after Monsieur and Madame\nHulot, and found seven physicians there, brought by Bianchon to study\nthis unique case; he had just joined them. The physicians, assembled in\nthe drawing-room, were discussing the disease; now one and now another\nwent into Valerie's room or Crevel's to take a note, and returned with\nan opinion based on this rapid study.\n\nThese princes of science were divided in their opinions. One, who\nstood alone in his views, considered it a case of poisoning, of private\nrevenge, and denied its identity with the disease known in the Middle\nAges. Three others regarded it as a specific deterioration of the blood\nand the humors. The rest, agreeing with Bianchon, maintained that the\nblood was poisoned by some hitherto unknown morbid infection. Bianchon\nproduced Professor Duval's analysis of the blood. The remedies to be\napplied, though absolutely empirical and without hope, depended on the\nverdict in this medical dilemma.\n\nLisbeth stood as if petrified three yards away from the bed where\nValerie lay dying, as she saw a priest from Saint-Thomas d'Aquin\nstanding by her friend's pillow, and a sister of charity in attendance.\nReligion could find a soul to save in a mass of rottenness which, of the\nfive senses of man, had now only that of sight. The sister of charity\nwho alone had been found to nurse Valerie stood apart. Thus the Catholic\nreligion, that divine institution, always actuated by the spirit of\nself-sacrifice, under its twofold aspect of the Spirit and the Flesh,\nwas tending this horrible and atrocious creature, soothing her death-bed\nby its infinite benevolence and inexhaustible stores of mercy.\n\nThe servants, in horror, refused to go into the room of either their\nmaster or mistress; they thought only of themselves, and judged their\nbetters as righteously stricken. The smell was so foul that in spite of\nopen windows and strong perfumes, no one could remain long in Valerie's\nroom. Religion alone kept guard there.\n\nHow could a woman so clever as Valerie fail to ask herself to what end\nthese two representatives of the Church remained with her? The dying\nwoman had listened to the words of the priest. Repentance had risen on\nher darkened soul as the devouring malady had consumed her beauty. The\nfragile Valerie had been less able to resist the inroads of the disease\nthan Crevel; she would be the first to succumb, and, indeed, had been\nthe first attacked.\n\n\"If I had not been ill myself, I would have come to nurse you,\" said\nLisbeth at last, after a glance at her friend's sunken eyes. \"I have\nkept my room this fortnight or three weeks; but when I heard of your\nstate from the doctor, I came at once.\"\n\n\"Poor Lisbeth, you at least love me still, I see!\" said Valerie.\n\"Listen. I have only a day or two left to think, for I cannot say to\nlive. You see, there is nothing left of me--I am a heap of mud! They\nwill not let me see myself in a glass.--Well, it is no more than I\ndeserve. Oh, if I might only win mercy, I would gladly undo all the\nmischief I have done.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Lisbeth, \"if you can talk like that, you are indeed a dead\nwoman.\"\n\n\"Do not hinder this woman's repentance, leave her in her Christian\nmind,\" said the priest.\n\n\"There is nothing left!\" said Lisbeth in consternation. \"I cannot\nrecognize her eyes or her mouth! Not a feature of her is there! And her\nwit has deserted her! Oh, it is awful!\"\n\n\"You don't know,\" said Valerie, \"what death is; what it is to be obliged\nto think of the morrow of your last day on earth, and of what is to\nbe found in the grave.--Worms for the body--and for the soul,\nwhat?--Lisbeth, I know there is another life! And I am given over to\nterrors which prevent my feeling the pangs of my decomposing body.--I,\nwho could laugh at a saint, and say to Crevel that the vengeance of God\ntook every form of disaster.--Well, I was a true prophet.--Do not trifle\nwith sacred things, Lisbeth; if you love me, repent as I do.\"\n\n\"I!\" said Lisbeth. \"I see vengeance wherever I turn in nature; insects\neven die to satisfy the craving for revenge when they are attacked. And\ndo not these gentlemen tell us\"--and she looked at the priest--\"that God\nis revenged, and that His vengeance lasts through all eternity?\"\n\nThe priest looked mildly at Lisbeth and said:\n\n\"You, madame, are an atheist!\"\n\n\"But look what I have come to,\" said Valerie.\n\n\"And where did you get this gangrene?\" asked the old maid, unmoved from\nher peasant incredulity.\n\n\"I had a letter from Henri which leaves me in no doubt as to my fate.\nHe has murdered me. And--just when I meant to live honestly--to die an\nobject of disgust!\n\n\"Lisbeth, give up all notions of revenge. Be kind to that family to whom\nI have left by my will everything I can dispose of. Go, child, though\nyou are the only creature who, at this hour, does not avoid me with\nhorror--go, I beseech you, and leave me.--I have only time to make my\npeace with God!\"\n\n\"She is wandering in her wits,\" said Lisbeth to herself, as she left the\nroom.\n\nThe strongest affection known, that of a woman for a woman, had not such\nheroic constancy as the Church. Lisbeth, stifled by the miasma, went\naway. She found the physicians still in consultation. But Bianchon's\nopinion carried the day, and the only question now was how to try the\nremedies.\n\n\"At any rate, we shall have a splendid _post-mortem_,\" said one of\nhis opponents, \"and there will be two cases to enable us to make\ncomparisons.\"\n\nLisbeth went in again with Bianchon, who went up to the sick woman\nwithout seeming aware of the malodorous atmosphere.\n\n\"Madame,\" said he, \"we intend to try a powerful remedy which may save\nyou--\"\n\n\"And if you save my life,\" said she, \"shall I be as good-looking as\never?\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" said the judicious physician.\n\n\"I know your _possibly_,\" said Valerie. \"I shall look like a woman who\nhas fallen into the fire! No, leave me to the Church. I can please no\none now but God. I will try to be reconciled to Him, and that will be my\nlast flirtation; yes, I must try to come round God!\"\n\n\"That is my poor Valerie's last jest; that is all herself!\" said Lisbeth\nin tears.\n\nLisbeth thought it her duty to go into Crevel's room, where she found\nVictorin and his wife sitting about a yard away from the stricken man's\nbed.\n\n\"Lisbeth,\" said he, \"they will not tell me what state my wife is in; you\nhave just seen her--how is she?\"\n\n\"She is better; she says she is saved,\" replied Lisbeth, allowing\nherself this play on the word to soothe Crevel's mind.\n\n\"That is well,\" said the Mayor. \"I feared lest I had been the cause of\nher illness. A man is not a traveler in perfumery for nothing; I had\nblamed myself.--If I should lose her, what would become of me? On my\nhonor, my children, I worship that woman.\"\n\nHe sat up in bed and tried to assume his favorite position.\n\n\"Oh, Papa!\" cried Celestine, \"if only you could be well again, I would\nmake friends with my stepmother--I make a vow!\"\n\n\"Poor little Celestine!\" said Crevel, \"come and kiss me.\"\n\nVictorin held back his wife, who was rushing forward.\n\n\"You do not know, perhaps,\" said the lawyer gently, \"that your disease\nis contagious, monsieur.\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" replied Crevel. \"And the doctors are quite proud of having\nrediscovered in me some long lost plague of the Middle Ages, which the\nFaculty has had cried like lost property--it is very funny!\"\n\n\"Papa,\" said Celestine, \"be brave, and you will get the better of this\ndisease.\"\n\n\"Be quite easy, my children; Death thinks twice of it before carrying\noff a Mayor of Paris,\" said he, with monstrous composure. \"And if, after\nall, my district is so unfortunate as to lose a man it has twice honored\nwith its suffrages--you see, what a flow of words I have!--Well, I shall\nknow how to pack up and go. I have been a commercial traveler; I am\nexperienced in such matters. Ah! my children, I am a man of strong\nmind.\"\n\n\"Papa, promise me to admit the Church--\"\n\n\"Never,\" replied Crevel. \"What is to be said? I drank the milk of\nRevolution; I have not Baron Holbach's wit, but I have his strength of\nmind. I am more _Regence_ than ever, more Musketeer, Abbe Dubois, and\nMarechal de Richelieu! By the Holy Poker!--My wife, who is wandering\nin her head, has just sent me a man in a gown--to me! the admirer of\nBeranger, the friend of Lisette, the son of Voltaire and Rousseau.--The\ndoctor, to feel my pulse, as it were, and see if sickness had subdued\nme--'You saw Monsieur l'Abbe?' said he.--Well, I imitated the great\nMontesquieu. Yes, I looked at the doctor--see, like this,\" and he turned\nto show three-quarters face, like his portrait, and extended his hand\nauthoritatively--\"and I said:\n\n             \"The slave was here,\n  He showed his order, but he nothing gained.\n\n\"_His order_ is a pretty jest, showing that even in death Monsieur le\nPresident de Montesquieu preserved his elegant wit, for they had sent\nhim a Jesuit. I admire that passage--I cannot say of his life, but\nof his death--the passage--another joke!--The passage from life to\ndeath--the Passage Montesquieu!\"\n\nVictorin gazed sadly at his father-in-law, wondering whether folly and\nvanity were not forces on a par with true greatness of soul. The causes\nthat act on the springs of the soul seem to be quite independent of the\nresults. Can it be that the fortitude which upholds a great criminal is\nthe same as that which a Champcenetz so proudly walks to the scaffold?\n\nBy the end of the week Madame Crevel was buried, after dreadful\nsufferings; and Crevel followed her within two days. Thus the\nmarriage-contract was annulled. Crevel was heir to Valerie.\n\nOn the very day after the funeral, the friar called again on the lawyer,\nwho received him in perfect silence. The monk held out his hand without\na word, and without a word Victorin Hulot gave him eighty thousand-franc\nnotes, taken from a sum of money found in Crevel's desk.\n\nYoung Madame Hulot inherited the estate of Presles and thirty thousand\nfrancs a year.\n\nMadame Crevel had bequeathed a sum of three hundred thousand francs\nto Baron Hulot. Her scrofulous boy Stanislas was to inherit, at his\nmajority, the Hotel Crevel and eighty thousand francs a year.\n\n\n\nAmong the many noble associations founded in Paris by Catholic charity,\nthere is one, originated by Madame de la Chanterie, for promoting civil\nand religious marriages between persons who have formed a voluntary\nbut illicit union. Legislators, who draw large revenues from the\nregistration fees, and the Bourgeois dynasty, which benefits by the\nnotary's profits, affect to overlook the fact that three-fourths of the\npoorer class cannot afford fifteen francs for the marriage-contract. The\npleaders, a sufficiently vilified body, gratuitously defend the cases\nof the indigent, while the notaries have not as yet agreed to charge\nnothing for the marriage-contract of the poor. As to the revenue\ncollectors, the whole machinery of Government would have to be\ndislocated to induce the authorities to relax their demands. The\nregistrar's office is deaf and dumb.\n\nThen the Church, too, receives a duty on marriages. In France the Church\ndepends largely on such revenues; even in the House of God it traffics\nin chairs and kneeling stools in a way that offends foreigners;\nthough it cannot have forgotten the anger of the Saviour who drove\nthe money-changers out of the Temple. If the Church is so loath to\nrelinquish its dues, it must be supposed that these dues, known as\nVestry dues, are one of its sources of maintenance, and then the fault\nof the Church is the fault of the State.\n\nThe co-operation of these conditions, at a time when charity is too\ngreatly concerned with the negroes and the petty offenders discharged\nfrom prison to trouble itself about honest folks in difficulties,\nresults in the existence of a number of decent couples who have never\nbeen legally married for lack of thirty francs, the lowest figure for\nwhich the Notary, the Registrar, the Mayor and the Church will unite\ntwo citizens of Paris. Madame de la Chanterie's fund, founded to restore\npoor households to their religious and legal status, hunts up such\ncouples, and with all the more success because it helps them in their\npoverty before attacking their unlawful union.\n\nAs soon as Madame Hulot had recovered, she returned to her occupations.\nAnd then it was that the admirable Madame de la Chanterie came to beg\nthat Adeline would add the legalization of these voluntary unions to the\nother good works of which she was the instrument.\n\nOne of the Baroness' first efforts in this cause was made in the\nominous-looking district, formerly known as la Petite Pologne--Little\nPoland--bounded by the Rue du Rocher, Rue de la Pepiniere, and Rue\nde Miromenil. There exists there a sort of offshoot of the Faubourg\nSaint-Marceau. To give an idea of this part of the town, it is enough\nto say that the landlords of some of the houses tenanted by working men\nwithout work, by dangerous characters, and by the very poor employed in\nunhealthy toil, dare not demand their rents, and can find no bailiffs\nbold enough to evict insolvent lodgers. At the present time speculating\nbuilders, who are fast changing the aspect of this corner of Paris, and\ncovering the waste ground lying between the Rue d'Amsterdam and the Rue\nFaubourg-du-Roule, will no doubt alter the character of the inhabitants;\nfor the trowel is a more civilizing agent than is generally supposed. By\nerecting substantial and handsome houses, with porters at the doors,\nby bordering the streets with footwalks and shops, speculation, while\nraising the rents, disperses the squalid class, families bereft of\nfurniture, and lodgers that cannot pay. And so these districts are\ncleared of such objectionable residents, and the dens vanish into which\nthe police never venture but under the sanction of the law.\n\nIn June 1844, the purlieus of the Place de Laborde were still far from\ninviting. The genteel pedestrian, who by chance should turn out of the\nRue de la Pepiniere into one of those dreadful side-streets, would have\nbeen dismayed to see how vile a bohemia dwelt cheek by jowl with the\naristocracy. In such places as these, haunted by ignorant poverty and\nmisery driven to bay, flourish the last public letter-writers who are\nto be found in Paris. Wherever you see the two words \"Ecrivain Public\"\nwritten in a fine copy hand on a sheet of letter-paper stuck to the\nwindow pane of some low entresol or mud-splashed ground-floor room, you\nmay safely conclude that the neighborhood is the lurking place of many\nunlettered folks, and of much vice and crime, the outcome of misery; for\nignorance is the mother of all sorts of crime. A crime is, in the first\ninstance, a defect of reasoning powers.\n\nWhile the Baroness had been ill, this quarter, to which she was a minor\nProvidence, had seen the advent of a public writer who settled in the\nPassage du Soleil--Sun Alley--a spot of which the name is one of the\nantitheses dear to the Parisian, for the passage is especially dark.\nThis writer, supposed to be a German, was named Vyder, and he lived on\nmatrimonial terms with a young creature of whom he was so jealous that\nhe never allowed her to go anywhere excepting to some honest stove and\nflue-fitters, in the Rue Saint-Lazare, Italians, as such fitters always\nare, but long since established in Paris. These people had been saved\nfrom a bankruptcy, which would have reduced them to misery, by the\nBaroness, acting in behalf of Madame de la Chanterie. In a few months\ncomfort had taken the place of poverty, and Religion had found a home in\nhearts which once had cursed Heaven with the energy peculiar to Italian\nstove-fitters. So one of Madame Hulot's first visits was to this family.\n\nShe was pleased at the scene that presented itself to her eyes at\nthe back of the house where these worthy folks lived in the Rue\nSaint-Lazare, not far from the Rue du Rocher. High above the stores\nand workshops, now well filled, where toiled a swarm of apprentices and\nworkmen--all Italians from the valley of Domo d'Ossola--the master's\nfamily occupied a set of rooms, which hard work had blessed with\nabundance. The Baroness was hailed like the Virgin Mary in person.\n\nAfter a quarter of an hour's questioning, Adeline, having to wait for\nthe father to inquire how his business was prospering, pursued her\nsaintly calling as a spy by asking whether they knew of any families\nneeding help.\n\n\"Ah, dear lady, you who could save the damned from hell!\" said the\nItalian wife, \"there is a girl quite near here to be saved from\nperdition.\"\n\n\"A girl well known to you?\" asked the Baroness.\n\n\"She is the granddaughter of a master my husband formerly worked for,\nwho came to France in 1798, after the Revolution, by name Judici. Old\nJudici, in Napoleon's time, was one of the principal stove-fitters in\nParis; he died in 1819, leaving his son a fine fortune. But the younger\nJudici wasted all his money on bad women; till, at last, he married one\nwho was sharper than the rest, and she had this poor little girl, who is\njust turned fifteen.\"\n\n\"And what is wrong with her?\" asked Adeline, struck by the resemblance\nbetween this Judici and her husband.\n\n\"Well, madame, this child, named Atala, ran away from her father, and\ncame to live close by here with an old German of eighty at least, named\nVyder, who does odd jobs for people who cannot read and write. Now,\nif this old sinner, who bought the child of her mother, they say for\nfifteen hundred francs, would but marry her, as he certainly has not\nlong to live, and as he is said to have some few thousand of francs a\nyear--well, the poor thing, who is a sweet little angel, would be out of\nmischief, and above want, which must be the ruin of her.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much for the information. I may do some good, but I must\nact with caution.--Who is the old man?\"\n\n\"Oh! madame, he is a good old fellow; he makes the child very happy, and\nhe has some sense too, for he left the part of town where the Judicis\nlive, as I believe, to snatch the child from her mother's clutches. The\nmother was jealous of her, and I dare say she thought she could make\nmoney out of her beauty and make a _mademoiselle_ of the girl.\n\n\"Atala remembered us, and advised her gentleman to settle near us; and\nas the good man sees how decent we are, he allows her to come here. But\nget them married, madame, and you will do an action worthy of you. Once\nmarried, the child will be independent and free from her mother, who\nkeeps an eye on her, and who, if she could make money by her, would like\nto see her on the stage, or successful in the wicked life she meant her\nto lead.\"\n\n\"Why doesn't the old man marry her?\"\n\n\"There was no necessity for it, you see,\" said the Italian. \"And though\nold Vyder is not a bad old fellow, I fancy he is sharp enough to wish\nto remain the master, while if he once got married--why, the poor man is\nafraid of the stone that hangs round every old man's neck.\"\n\n\"Could you send for the girl to come here?\" said Madame Hulot. \"I should\nsee her quietly, and find out what could be done--\"\n\nThe stove-fitter's wife signed to her eldest girl, who ran off. Ten\nminutes later she returned, leading by the hand a child of fifteen and\na half, a beauty of the Italian type. Mademoiselle Judici inherited from\nher father that ivory skin which, rather yellow by day, is by artificial\nlight of lily-whiteness; eyes of Oriental beauty, form, and brilliancy,\nclose curling lashes like black feathers, hair of ebony hue, and that\nnative dignity of the Lombard race which makes the foreigner, as he\nwalks through Milan on a Sunday, fancy that every porter's daughter is a\nprincess.\n\nAtala, told by the stove-fitter's daughter that she was to meet the\ngreat lady of whom she had heard so much, had hastily dressed in a\nblack silk gown, a smart little cape, and neat boots. A cap with a\ncherry-colored bow added to the brilliant effect of her coloring. The\nchild stood in an attitude of artless curiosity, studying the Baroness\nout of the corner of her eye, for her palsied trembling puzzled her\ngreatly.\n\nAdeline sighed deeply as she saw this jewel of womanhood in the mire of\nprostitution, and determined to rescue her to virtue.\n\n\"What is your name, my dear?\"\n\n\"Atala, madame.\"\n\n\"And can you read and write?\"\n\n\"No, madame; but that does not matter, as monsieur can.\"\n\n\"Did your parents ever take you to church? Have you been to your first\nCommunion? Do you know your Catechism?\"\n\n\"Madame, papa wanted to make me do something of the kind you speak of,\nbut mamma would not have it--\"\n\n\"Your mother?\" exclaimed the Baroness. \"Is she bad to you, then?\"\n\n\"She was always beating me. I don't know why, but I was always being\nquarreled over by my father and mother--\"\n\n\"Did you ever hear of God?\" cried the Baroness.\n\nThe girl looked up wide-eyed.\n\n\"Oh, yes, papa and mamma often said 'Good God,' and 'In God's name,' and\n'God's thunder,'\" said she, with perfect simplicity.\n\n\"Then you never saw a church? Did you never think of going into one?\"\n\n\"A church?--Notre-Dame, the Pantheon?--I have seen them from a distance,\nwhen papa took me into town; but that was not very often. There are no\nchurches like those in the Faubourg.\"\n\n\"Which Faubourg did you live in?\"\n\n\"In the Faubourg.\"\n\n\"Yes, but which?\"\n\n\"In the Rue de Charonne, madame.\"\n\nThe inhabitants of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine never call that notorious\ndistrict other than _the_ Faubourg. To them it is the one and only\nFaubourg; and manufacturers generally understand the words as meaning\nthe Faubourg Saint-Antoine.\n\n\"Did no one ever tell you what was right or wrong?\"\n\n\"Mamma used to beat me when I did not do what pleased her.\"\n\n\"But did you not know that it was very wicked to run away from your\nfather and mother to go to live with an old man?\"\n\nAtala Judici gazed at the Baroness with a haughty stare, but made no\nreply.\n\n\"She is a perfect little savage,\" murmured Adeline.\n\n\"There are a great many like her in the Faubourg, madame,\" said the\nstove-fitter's wife.\n\n\"But she knows nothing--not even what is wrong. Good Heavens!--Why do\nyou not answer me?\" said Madame Hulot, putting out her hand to take\nAtala's.\n\nAtala indignantly withdrew a step.\n\n\"You are an old fool!\" said she. \"Why, my father and mother had had\nnothing to eat for a week. My mother wanted me to do much worse than\nthat, I think, for my father thrashed her and called her a thief!\nHowever, Monsieur Vyder paid all their debts, and gave them some\nmoney--oh, a bagful! And he brought me away, and poor papa was crying.\nBut we had to part!--Was it wicked?\" she asked.\n\n\"And are you very fond of Monsieur Vyder?\"\n\n\"Fond of him?\" said she. \"I should think so! He tells me beautiful\nstories, madame, every evening; and he has given me nice gowns, and\nlinen, and a shawl. Why, I am figged out like a princess, and I never\nwear sabots now. And then, I have not known what it is to be hungry\nthese two months past. And I don't live on potatoes now. He brings me\nbonbons and burnt almonds, and chocolate almonds.--Aren't they good?--I\ndo anything he pleases for a bag of chocolate.--Then my old Daddy is\nvery kind; he takes such care of me, and is so nice; I know now what my\nmother ought to have been.--He is going to get an old woman to help\nme, for he doesn't like me to dirty my hands with cooking. For the past\nmonth, too, he has been making a little money, and he gives me three\nfrancs every evening that I put into a money-box. Only he will never\nlet me out except to come here--and he calls me his little kitten! Mamma\nnever called me anything but bad names--and thief, and vermin!\"\n\n\"Well, then, my child, why should not Daddy Vyder be your husband?\"\n\n\"But he is, madame,\" said the girl, looking at Adeline with calm pride,\nwithout a blush, her brow smooth, her eyes steady. \"He told me that I\nwas his little wife; but it is a horrid bore to be a man's wife--if it\nwere not for the burnt almonds!\"\n\n\"Good Heaven!\" said the Baroness to herself, \"what monster can have had\nthe heart to betray such perfect, such holy innocence? To restore this\nchild to the ways of virtue would surely atone for many sins.--I knew\nwhat I was doing.\" thought she, remembering the scene with Crevel. \"But\nshe--she knows nothing.\"\n\n\"Do you know Monsieur Samanon?\" asked Atala, with an insinuating look.\n\n\"No, my child; but why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Really and truly?\" said the artless girl.\n\n\"You have nothing to fear from this lady,\" said the Italian woman. \"She\nis an angel.\"\n\n\"It is because my good old boy is afraid of being caught by Samanon. He\nis hiding, and I wish he could be free--\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"On! then he would take me to Bobino, perhaps to the Ambigu.\"\n\n\"What a delightful creature!\" said the Baroness, kissing the girl.\n\n\"Are you rich?\" asked Atala, who was fingering the Baroness' lace\nruffles.\n\n\"Yes, and No,\" replied Madame Hulot. \"I am rich for dear little girls\nlike you when they are willing to be taught their duties as Christians\nby a priest, and to walk in the right way.\"\n\n\"What way is that?\" said Atala; \"I walk on my two feet.\"\n\n\"The way of virtue.\"\n\nAtala looked at the Baroness with a crafty smile.\n\n\"Look at madame,\" said the Baroness, pointing to the stove-fitter's\nwife, \"she has been quite happy because she was received into the bosom\nof the Church. You married like the beasts that perish.\"\n\n\"I?\" said Atala. \"Why, if you will give me as much as Daddy Vyder gives\nme, I shall be quite happy unmarried again. It is a grind.--Do you know\nwhat it is to--?\"\n\n\"But when once you are united to a man as you are,\" the Baroness put in,\n\"virtue requires you to remain faithful to him.\"\n\n\"Till he dies,\" said Atala, with a knowing flash. \"I shall not have to\nwait long. If you only knew how Daddy Vyder coughs and blows.--Poof,\npoof,\" and she imitated the old man.\n\n\"Virtue and morality require that the Church, representing God, and the\nMayor, representing the law, should consecrate your marriage,\" Madame\nHulot went on. \"Look at madame; she is legally married--\"\n\n\"Will it make it more amusing?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"You will be happier,\" said the Baroness, \"for no one could then blame\nyou. You would satisfy God! Ask her if she was married without the\nsacrament of marriage!\"\n\nAtala looked at the Italian.\n\n\"How is she any better than I am?\" she asked. \"I am prettier than she\nis.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I am an honest woman,\" said the wife, \"and you may be called\nby a bad name.\"\n\n\"How can you expect God to protect you if you trample every law, human\nand divine, under foot?\" said the Baroness. \"Don't you know that God has\nParadise in store for those who obey the injunctions of His Church?\"\n\n\"What is there in Paradise? Are there playhouses?\"\n\n\"Paradise!\" said Adeline, \"is every joy you can conceive of. It is full\nof angels with white wings. You see God in all His glory, you share His\npower, you are happy for every minute of eternity!\"\n\nAtala listened to the lady as she might have listened to music; but\nAdeline, seeing that she was incapable of understanding her, thought she\nhad better take another line of action and speak to the old man.\n\n\"Go home, then, my child, and I will go to see Monsieur Vyder. Is he a\nFrenchman?\"\n\n\"He is an Alsatian, madame. But he will be quite rich soon. If you\nwould pay what he owes to that vile Samanon, he would give you back\nyour money, for in a few months he will be getting six thousand francs\na year, he says, and we are to go to live in the country a long way off,\nin the Vosges.\"\n\nAt the word _Vosges_ the Baroness sat lost in reverie. It called up\nthe vision of her native village. She was roused from her melancholy\nmeditation by the entrance of the stove-fitter, who came to assure her\nof his prosperity.\n\n\"In a year's time, madame, I can repay the money you lent us, for it\nis God's money, the money of the poor and wretched. If ever I make a\nfortune, come to me for what you want, and I will render through you the\nhelp to others which you first brought us.\"\n\n\"Just now,\" said Madame Hulot, \"I do not need your money, but I ask your\nassistance in a good work. I have just seen that little Judici, who is\nliving with an old man, and I mean to see them regularly and legally\nmarried.\"\n\n\"Ah! old Vyder; he is a very worthy old fellow, with plenty of good\nsense. The poor old man has already made friends in the neighborhood,\nthough he has been here but two months. He keeps my accounts for me. He\nis, I believe, a brave Colonel who served the Emperor well. And how he\nadores Napoleon!--He has some orders, but he never wears them. He is\nwaiting till he is straight again, for he is in debt, poor old boy! In\nfact, I believe he is hiding, threatened by the law--\"\n\n\"Tell him that I will pay his debts if he will marry the child.\"\n\n\"Oh, that will soon be settled.--Suppose you were to see him, madame; it\nis not two steps away, in the Passage du Soleil.\"\n\nSo the lady and the stove-fitter went out.\n\n\"This way, madame,\" said the man, turning down the Rue de la Pepiniere.\n\nThe alley runs, in fact, from the bottom of this street through to the\nRue du Rocher. Halfway down this passage, recently opened through, where\nthe shops let at a very low rent, the Baroness saw on a window, screened\nup to a height with a green, gauze curtain, which excluded the prying\neyes of the passer-by, the words:\n\n\n\"ECRIVAIN PUBLIC\"; and on the door the announcement:\n\n                         BUSINESS TRANSACTED.\n\n             _Petitions Drawn Up, Accounts Audited, Etc._\n\n                     _With Secrecy and Dispatch._\n\n\nThe shop was like one of those little offices where travelers by omnibus\nwait the vehicles to take them on to their destination. A private\nstaircase led up, no doubt, to the living-rooms on the entresol which\nwere let with the shop. Madame Hulot saw a dirty writing-table of some\nlight wood, some letter-boxes, and a wretched second-hand chair. A\ncap with a peak and a greasy green shade for the eyes suggested either\nprecautions for disguise, or weak eyes, which was not unlikely in an old\nman.\n\n\"He is upstairs,\" said the stove-fitter. \"I will go up and tell him to\ncome down.\"\n\nAdeline lowered her veil and took a seat. A heavy step made the narrow\nstairs creak, and Adeline could not restrain a piercing cry when she\nsaw her husband, Baron Hulot, in a gray knitted jersey, old gray flannel\ntrousers, and slippers.\n\n\"What is your business, madame?\" said Hulot, with a flourish.\n\nShe rose, seized Hulot by the arm, and said in a voice hoarse with\nemotion:\n\n\"At last--I have found you!\"\n\n\"Adeline!\" exclaimed the Baron in bewilderment, and he locked the shop\ndoor. \"Joseph, go out the back way,\" he added to the stove-fitter.\n\n\"My dear!\" she said, forgetting everything in her excessive joy, \"you\ncan come home to us all; we are rich. Your son draws a hundred and sixty\nthousand francs a year! Your pension is released; there are fifteen\nthousand francs of arrears you can get on showing that you are alive.\nValerie is dead, and left you three hundred thousand francs.\n\n\"Your name is quite forgotten by this time; you may reappear in the\nworld, and you will find a fortune awaiting you at your son's house.\nCome; our happiness will be complete. For nearly three years I have\nbeen seeking you, and I felt so sure of finding you that a room is ready\nwaiting for you. Oh! come away from this, come away from the dreadful\nstate I see you in!\"\n\n\"I am very willing,\" said the bewildered Baron, \"but can I take the\ngirl?\"\n\n\"Hector, give her up! Do that much for your Adeline, who has never\nbefore asked you to make the smallest sacrifice. I promise you I will\ngive the child a marriage portion; I will see that she marries well, and\nhas some education. Let it be said of one of the women who have given\nyou happiness that she too is happy; and do not relapse into vice, into\nthe mire.\"\n\n\"So it was you,\" said the Baron, with a smile, \"who wanted to see me\nmarried?--Wait a few minutes,\" he added; \"I will go upstairs and dress;\nI have some decent clothes in a trunk.\"\n\nAdeline, left alone, and looking round the squalid shop, melted into\ntears.\n\n\"He has been living here, and we rolling in wealth!\" said she to\nherself. \"Poor man, he has indeed been punished--he who was elegance\nitself.\"\n\nThe stove-fitter returned to make his bow to his benefactress, and she\ndesired him to fetch a coach. When he came back, she begged him to give\nlittle Atala Judici a home, and to take her away at once.\n\n\"And tell her that if she will place herself under the guidance of\nMonsieur the Cure of the Madeleine, on the day when she attends her\nfirst Communion I will give her thirty thousand francs and find her a\ngood husband, some worthy young man.\"\n\n\"My eldest son, then madame! He is two-and-twenty, and he worships the\nchild.\"\n\nThe Baron now came down; there were tears in his eyes.\n\n\"You are forcing me to desert the only creature who had ever begun to\nlove me at all as you do!\" said he in a whisper to his wife. \"She is\ncrying bitterly, and I cannot abandon her so--\"\n\n\"Be quite easy, Hector. She will find a home with honest people, and I\nwill answer for her conduct.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I can go with you,\" said the Baron, escorting his wife to\nthe cab.\n\nHector, the Baron d'Ervy once more, had put on a blue coat and trousers,\na white waistcoat, a black stock, and gloves. When the Baroness had\ntaken her seat in the vehicle, Atala slipped in like an eel.\n\n\"Oh, madame,\" she said, \"let me go with you. I will be so good, so\nobedient; I will do whatever you wish; but do not part me from my Daddy\nVyder, my kind Daddy who gives me such nice things. I shall be beaten--\"\n\n\"Come, come, Atala,\" said the Baron, \"this lady is my wife--we must\npart--\"\n\n\"She! As old as that! and shaking like a leaf!\" said the child. \"Look at\nher head!\" and she laughingly mimicked the Baroness' palsy.\n\nThe stove-fitter, who had run after the girl, came to the carriage door.\n\n\"Take her away!\" said Adeline. The man put his arms round Atala and\nfairly carried her off.\n\n\"Thanks for such a sacrifice, my dearest,\" said Adeline, taking the\nBaron's hand and clutching it with delirious joy. \"How much you are\naltered! you must have suffered so much! What a surprise for Hortense\nand for your son!\"\n\nAdeline talked as lovers talk who meet after a long absence, of a\nhundred things at once.\n\nIn ten minutes the Baron and his wife reached the Rue Louis-le-Grand,\nand there Adeline found this note awaiting her:--\n\n  \"MADAME LA BARONNE,--\n\n  \"Monsieur le Baron Hulot d'Ervy lived for one month in the Rue de\n  Charonne under the name of Thorec, an anagram of Hector. He is now\n  in the Passage du Soleil by the name of Vyder. He says he is an\n  Alsatian, and does writing, and he lives with a girl named Atala\n  Judici. Be very cautious, madame, for search is on foot; the Baron\n  is wanted, on what score I know not.\n\n  \"The actress has kept her word, and remains, as ever,\n\n  \"Madame la Baronne, your humble servant,\n\n  \"J. M.\"\n\n\nThe Baron's return was hailed with such joy as reconciled him to\ndomestic life. He forgot little Atala Judici, for excesses of profligacy\nhad reduced him to the volatility of feeling that is characteristic of\nchildhood. But the happiness of the family was dashed by the change that\nhad come over him. He had been still hale when he had gone away from\nhis home; he had come back almost a hundred, broken, bent, and his\nexpression even debased.\n\nA splendid dinner, improvised by Celestine, reminded the old man of the\nsinger's banquets; he was dazzled by the splendor of his home.\n\n\"A feast in honor of the return of the prodigal father?\" said he in a\nmurmur to Adeline.\n\n\"Hush!\" said she, \"all is forgotten.\"\n\n\"And Lisbeth?\" he asked, not seeing the old maid.\n\n\"I am sorry to say that she is in bed,\" replied Hortense. \"She can never\nget up, and we shall have the grief of losing her ere long. She hopes to\nsee you after dinner.\"\n\nAt daybreak next morning Victorin Hulot was informed by the porter's\nwife that soldiers of the municipal guard were posted all round the\npremises; the police demanded Baron Hulot. The bailiff, who had followed\nthe woman, laid a summons in due form before the lawyer, and asked\nhim whether he meant to pay his father's debts. The claim was for ten\nthousand francs at the suit of an usurer named Samanon, who had probably\nlent the Baron two or three thousand at most. Victorin desired the\nbailiff to dismiss his men, and paid.\n\n\"But is it the last?\" he anxiously wondered.\n\nLisbeth, miserable already at seeing the family so prosperous, could not\nsurvive this happy event. She grew so rapidly worse that Bianchon gave\nher but a week to live, conquered at last in the long struggle in which\nshe had scored so many victories.\n\nShe kept the secret of her hatred even through a painful death from\npulmonary consumption. And, indeed, she had the supreme satisfaction\nof seeing Adeline, Hortense, Hulot, Victorin, Steinbock, Celestine, and\ntheir children standing in tears round her bed and mourning for her as\nthe angel of the family.\n\nBaron Hulot, enjoying a course of solid food such as he had not known\nfor nearly three years, recovered flesh and strength, and was almost\nhimself again. This improvement was such a joy to Adeline that her\nnervous trembling perceptibly diminished.\n\n\"She will be happy after all,\" said Lisbeth to herself on the day before\nshe died, as she saw the veneration with which the Baron regarded his\nwife, of whose sufferings he had heard from Hortense and Victorin.\n\nAnd vindictiveness hastened Cousin Betty's end. The family followed her,\nweeping, to the grave.\n\nThe Baron and Baroness, having reached the age which looks for perfect\nrest, gave up the handsome rooms on the first floor to the Count\nand Countess Steinbock, and took those above. The Baron by his son's\nexertions found an official position in the management of a railroad,\nin 1845, with a salary of six thousand francs, which, added to the six\nthousand of his pension and the money left to him by Madame Crevel,\nsecured him an income of twenty-four thousand francs. Hortense having\nenjoyed her independent income during the three years of separation from\nWenceslas, Victorin now invested the two hundred thousand francs he\nhad in trust, in his sister's name and he allowed her twelve thousand\nfrancs.\n\nWenceslas, as the husband of a rich woman, was not unfaithful, but he\nwas an idler; he could not make up his mind to begin any work, however\ntrifling. Once more he became the artist _in partibus_; he was popular\nin society, and consulted by amateurs; in short, he became a critic,\nlike all the feeble folk who fall below their promise.\n\nThus each household, though living as one family, had its own fortune.\nThe Baroness, taught by bitter experience, left the management of\nmatters to her son, and the Baron was thus reduced to his salary, in\nhope that the smallness of his income would prevent his relapsing into\nmischief. And by some singular good fortune, on which neither the mother\nnor the son had reckoned, Hulot seemed to have foresworn the fair sex.\nHis subdued behaviour, ascribed to the course of nature, so completely\nreassured the family, that they enjoyed to the full his recovered\namiability and delightful qualities. He was unfailingly attentive to his\nwife and children, escorted them to the play, reappeared in society, and\ndid the honors to his son's house with exquisite grace. In short, this\nreclaimed prodigal was the joy of his family.\n\nHe was a most agreeable old man, a ruin, but full of wit, having\nretained no more of his vice than made it an added social grace.\n\nOf course, everybody was quite satisfied and easy. The young people and\nthe Baroness lauded the model father to the skies, forgetting the death\nof the two uncles. Life cannot go on without much forgetting!\n\nMadame Victorin, who managed this enormous household with great skill,\ndue, no doubt, to Lisbeth's training, had found it necessary to have a\nman-cook. This again necessitated a kitchen-maid. Kitchen-maids are in\nthese days ambitious creatures, eager to detect the _chef's_ secrets,\nand to become cooks as soon as they have learnt to stir a sauce.\nConsequently, the kitchen-maid is liable to frequent change.\n\nAt the beginning of 1845 Celestine engaged as kitchen-maid a sturdy\nNormandy peasant come from Isigny--short-waisted, with strong red arms,\na common face, as dull as an \"occasional piece\" at the play, and hardly\nto be persuaded out of wearing the classical linen cap peculiar to the\nwomen of Lower Normandy. This girl, as buxom as a wet-nurse, looked\nas if she would burst the blue cotton check in which she clothed her\nperson. Her florid face might have been hewn out of stone, so hard were\nits tawny outlines.\n\nOf course no attention was paid to the advent in the house of this girl,\nwhose name was Agathe--an ordinary, wide-awake specimen, such as is\ndaily imported from the provinces. Agathe had no attractions for the\ncook, her tongue was too rough, for she had served in a suburban inn,\nwaiting on carters; and instead of making a conquest of her chief and\nwinning from him the secrets of the high art of the kitchen, she was\nthe object of his great contempt. The _chef's_ attentions were, in fact,\ndevoted to Louise, the Countess Steinbock's maid. The country girl,\nthinking herself ill-used, complained bitterly that she was always sent\nout of the way on some pretext when the _chef_ was finishing a dish or\nputting the crowning touch to a sauce.\n\n\"I am out of luck,\" said she, \"and I shall go to another place.\"\n\nAnd yet she stayed though she had twice given notice to quit.\n\nOne night, Adeline, roused by some unusual noise, did not see Hector in\nthe bed he occupied near hers; for they slept side by side in two beds,\nas beseemed an old couple. She lay awake an hour, but he did not return.\nSeized with a panic, fancying some tragic end had overtaken him--an\napoplectic attack, perhaps--she went upstairs to the floor occupied by\nthe servants, and then was attracted to the room where Agathe slept,\npartly by seeing a light below the door, and partly by the murmur\nof voices. She stood still in dismay on recognizing the voice of her\nhusband, who, a victim to Agathe's charms, to vanquish this strapping\nwench's not disinterested resistance, went to the length of saying:\n\n\"My wife has not long to live, and if you like you may be a Baroness.\"\n\nAdeline gave a cry, dropped her candlestick, and fled.\n\nThree days later the Baroness, who had received the last sacraments, was\ndying, surrounded by her weeping family.\n\nJust before she died, she took her husband's hand and pressed it,\nmurmuring in his ear:\n\n\"My dear, I had nothing left to give up to you but my life. In a minute\nor two you will be free, and can make another Baronne Hulot.\"\n\nAnd, rare sight, tears oozed from her dead eyes.\n\nThis desperateness of vice had vanquished the patience of the angel,\nwho, on the brink of eternity, gave utterance to the only reproach she\nhad ever spoken in her life.\n\nThe Baron left Paris three days after his wife's funeral. Eleven months\nafter Victorin heard indirectly of his father's marriage to Mademoiselle\nAgathe Piquetard, solemnized at Isigny, on the 1st February 1846.\n\n\"Parents may hinder their children's marriage, but children cannot\ninterfere with the insane acts of their parents in their second\nchildhood,\" said Maitre Hulot to Maitre Popinot, the second son of the\nMinister of Commerce, who was discussing this marriage.\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\n\nThe following personages appear in other stories of the Human Comedy.\n\n     Beauvisage, Phileas\n       The Member for Arcis\n\n     Berthier (Parisian notary)\n       Cousin Pons\n\n     Bianchon, Horace\n       Father Goriot\n       The Atheist's Mass\n       Cesar Birotteau\n       The Commission in Lunacy\n       Lost Illusions\n       A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       The Secrets of a Princess\n       The Government Clerks\n       Pierrette\n       A Study of Woman\n       Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n       Honorine\n       The Seamy Side of History\n       The Magic Skin\n       A Second Home\n       A Prince of Bohemia\n       Letters of Two Brides\n       The Muse of the Department\n       The Imaginary Mistress\n       The Middle Classes\n       The Country Parson\n     In addition, M.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":654,"split":"train"}
