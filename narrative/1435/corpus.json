{"ori_id":"f3e2078f74f7621ccbe1ceb3b3c9e68b6516db3a","title":"The Purple Cloud","context":"The Purple Cloud\n The story, a recording of a medium's meditation over the future writing of the text, details the narrator, Adam Jeffson, on an expedition to the North Pole during the 20th century on board the Boreal.\nJeffson's fianc\u0102\u0160e, the Countess Clodagh, poisons her own cousin in order to secure a place on the ship for Jeffson, because the expedition was known to be one of the best ever planned. A millionaire who died some years previously had provided in his will for the payment of $175,000,000 to the first person to stand at the North Pole.\nBefore Jeffson leaves, he hears a sermon by a Scottish priest, named Mackay, speaking against Polar research, calling the failure of all previous expeditions the will of God, and prophesying a terrible fate for those who attempt to go against God's will. Jeffson at the same time remembers his meeting with a man who claimed that the universe is a place of strife between vague \"powers\", \"The White\" and \"The Black\", for dominance.\nThroughout the events of the polar journey, Jeffson gradually discovers that his course has been, for many years, guided by these forces, all the way up to the point when he reaches the pole. He finds a huge clear lake of spinning water, with a rocky island inlaid with inscriptions. Upon seeing this, Jeffson suddenly faints. When he returns to his camp he, along with his dogs, feels nauseated after having smelled a peculiar peach-like odour. He also notices a moving purple cloud, spreading in the far heavens. During the progress of his journey, he discovers dead animals, all without the slightest sign of injury, and he gradually learns of the death of his entire crew on board the Boreal.\nThe ship being fairly easy to operate, he sets out by himself. First he travels towards northern islands, but upon seeing the death of all various races from around the world there (the result of an exodus, escaping the death-bringing cloud), and meeting ships crowded with corpses, he comes instead to the dead continent, walking through London, searching for news of the cloud. He looks for any survivors in shut mines, but finds all barricades broken through by mad crowds. Later, he goes to the house of Arthur Machen (an actual close friend of Shiel's), whom he finds dead, having been writing a poem until the very end. There, he finds the notebook into which he writes his whole narrative.\nThe later parts of the book describe Jeffson's descent into mad pompousness: adopting Turkish attire, he declares himself monarch and burns down cities (including Paris, Bordeaux, London, and San Francisco) for pleasure. He then commits his life to one task, the construction of a huge and colossal golden palace on the isle of Imbros, which he means to dedicate as an altar to God and a palace to himself. He spends seventeen years on the palace, several times abandoning the work, until its completion, when he recognizes the vanity of it.\nWhile travelling through Constantinople, which he also burns down, he meets a twenty-year-old naked woman who is without the slightest knowledge of anything in the world. She continues to follow him, no matter how he mistreats her. Gradually, he accepts her, but forces her to wear a veil over her mouth. Her speed at learning astonishes him, so he teaches her to speak, read, cook, fish, and dress.\nThe girl (who is unable to pronounce \"r\", instead saying \"l\") reveals that she had lived her whole life in a cellar below the royal palace of Turkey, and that she knew nothing of the world until she was freed when Jeffson burned down Constantinople. She becomes absorbed in the Bible and declares the humans who sought for riches as \"spoiled\".\nJeffson struggles mightily against his growing affection towards the girl, wishing to end the human race. At the very end, when he leaves to go to England, she telephones him about the re-appearance of the Purple Cloud over France. He rushes to her, embracing her as his wife and now hoping to find a way to escape the cloud. She tells him to trust that God will not allow her to die. He concludes his writing by saying that he has accepted his role and that after three weeks have passed no purple cloud has appeared, and he looks forward to the two of them becoming the progenitors of future humanity.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Purple Cloud, by M.P.

They came from a very good friend of mine, whose name there is\nno reason that I should now conceal--Dr. Arthur Lister Browne, M.A.\n(Oxon.), F.R.C.P. It happened that for two years I had been spending\nmost of my time in France, and as Browne had a Norfolk practice, I had\nnot seen him during my visits to London. Moreover, though our friendship\nwas of the most intimate kind, we were both atrocious correspondents: so\nthat only two notes passed between us during those years.\n\nTill, last May, there reached me the letter--and the packet--to which I\nrefer. The packet consisted of four note-books, quite crowded\nthroughout with those giddy shapes of Pitman's shorthand, whose\n_ensemble_ so resembles startled swarms hovering in flighty poses on the\nwing. They were scribbled in pencil, with little distinction between\nthick and thin strokes, few vowels: so that their slow deciphering, I\ncan assure the reader, has been no holiday. The letter also was\npencilled in shorthand; and this letter, together with the second of the\nnote-books which I have deciphered (it was marked 'III.'), I now\npublish.\n\n[I must say, however, that in some five instances there will occur\nsentences rather crutched by my own guess-work; and in two instances the\ncharacters were so impossibly mystical, that I had to abandon the\npassage with a head-ache. But all this will be found immaterial to the\ngeneral narrative.]\n\nThe following is Browne's letter:\n\n'DEAR OLD SHIEL,--I have just been lying thinking of you, and wishing\nthat you were here to give one a last squeeze of the hand before\nI--\"_go_\": for, by all appearance, \"going\" I am. Four days ago, I began\nto feel a soreness in the throat, and passing by old Johnson's surgery\nat Selbridge, went in and asked him to have a look at me. He muttered\nsomething about membranous laryngitis which made me smile, but by the\ntime I reached home I was hoarse, and not smiling: before night I had\ndyspnoca and laryngeal stridor. I at once telegraphed to London for\nMorgan, and, between him and Johnson, they have been opening my trachea,\nand burning my inside with chromic acid and the galvanic cautery. The\ndifficulty as to breathing has subsided, and it is wonderful how little\nI suffer: but I am much too old a hand not to know what's what: the\nbronchi are involved--_too far_ involved--and as a matter of absolute\nfact, there isn't any hope. Morgan is still, I believe, fondly dwelling\nupon the possibility of adding me to his successful-tracheotomy\nstatistics, but prognosis was always my strong point, and I say No. The\nvery small consolation of my death will be the beating of a specialist\nin his own line. So we shall see.\n\n'I have been arranging some of my affairs this morning, and remembered\nthese notebooks. I intended letting you have them months ago, but my\nhabit of putting things off, and the fact that the lady was alive from\nwhom I took down the words, prevented me. Now she is dead, and as a\nliterary man, and a student of life, you should be interested, if you\ncan manage to read them. You may even find them valuable.\n\n'I am under a little morphia at present, propped up in a nice little\nstate of languor, and as I am able to write without much effort, I will\ntell you in the old Pitman's something about her. Her name was Miss Mary\nWilson; she was about thirty when I met her, forty-five when she died,\nand I knew her intimately all those fifteen years. Do you know anything\nabout the philosophy of the hypnotic trance? Well, that was the relation\nbetween us--hypnotist and subject. She had been under another man before\nmy time, but no one was ever so successful with her as I. She suffered\nfrom _tic douloureux_ of the fifth nerve. She had had most of her teeth\ndrawn before I saw her, and an attempt had been made to wrench out the\nnerve on the left side by the external scission. But it made no\ndifference: all the clocks in hell tick-tacked in that poor woman's jaw,\nand it was the mercy of Providence that ever she came across _me_. My\norganisation was found to have almost complete, and quite easy, control\nover hers, and with a few passes I could expel her Legion.\n\n'Well, you never saw anyone so singular in personal appearance as my\nfriend, Miss Wilson. Medicine-man as I am, I could never behold her\nsuddenly without a sensation of shock: she suggested so inevitably what\nwe call \"the _other_ world,\" one detecting about her some odour of the\nworm, with the feeling that here was rather ghost than woman. And yet I\ncan hardly convey to you the why of this, except by dry details as to\nthe contours of her lofty brow, meagre lips, pointed chin, and ashen\ncheeks. She was tall and deplorably emaciated, her whole skeleton,\nexcept the thigh-bones, being quite visible. Her eyes were of the bluish\nhue of cigarette smoke, and had in them the strangest, feeble, unearthly\ngaze; while at thirty-five her paltry wisp of hair was quite white.\n\n'She was well-to-do, and lived alone in old Wooding Manor-house, five\nmiles from Ash Thomas. As you know, I was \"beginning\" in these parts at\nthe time, and soon took up my residence at the manor. She insisted that\nI should devote myself to her alone; and that one patient constituted\nthe most lucrative practice which I ever had.\n\n'Well, I quickly found that, in the state of trance, Miss Wilson\npossessed very remarkable powers: remarkable, I mean, not, of course,\nbecause peculiar to herself in _kind_, but because they were so\nconstant, reliable, exact, and far-reaching, in degree. The veriest\nfledgling in psychical science will now sit and discourse finically to\nyou about the reporting powers of the mind in its trance state--just as\nthough it was something quite new! This simple fact, I assure you, which\nthe Psychical Research Society, only after endless investigation, admits\nto be scientific, has been perfectly well known to every old crone since\nthe Middle Ages, and, I assume, long previously. What an unnecessary air\nof discovery! The certainty that someone in trance in Manchester can\ntell you what is going on in London, or in Pekin, was not, of course,\nleft to the acumen of an office in Fleet Street; and the society, in\nestablishing the fact beyond doubt for the general public, has not gone\none step toward explaining it. They have, in fact, revealed nothing that\nmany of us did not, with absolute assurance, know before.\n\n'But talking of poor Miss Wilson, I say that her powers were\n_remarkable_, because, though not exceptional in _genre_, they were so\nspecial in quantity,--so \"constant,\" and \"far-reaching.\" I believe it to\nbe a fact that, _in general_, the powers of trance manifest themselves\nmore particularly with regard to space, as distinct from time: the\nspirit roams in the present--it travels over a plain--it does not\n_usually_ attract the interest of observers by great ascents, or by\ngreat descents. I fancy that is so. But Miss Wilson's gift was special\nto this extent, that she travelled in every direction, and easily in all\nbut one, north and south, up and down, in the past, the present, and the\nfuture.\n\nThis I discovered, not at once, but gradually. She would emit a stream\nof sounds in the trance state--I can hardly call it _speech_, so\nmurmurous, yet guttural, was the utterance, mixed with puffy\nbreath-sounds at the languid lips. This state was accompanied by an\nintense contraction of the pupils, absence of the knee-jerk,\nconsiderable rigor, and a rapt and arrant expression. I got into the\nhabit of sitting long hours at her bed-side, quite fascinated by her,\ntrying to catch the import of that opiate and visionary language which\ncame puffing and fluttering in deliberate monotone from her lips.\nGradually, in the course of months, my ear learned to detect the words;\n\"the veil was rent\" for me also; and I was able to follow somewhat the\ncourse of her musing and wandering spirit.\n\nAt the end of six months I heard her one day repeat some words which\nwere familiar to me. They were these: \"Such were the arts by which the\nRomans extended their conquests, and attained the palm of victory; and\nthe concurring testimony of different authors enables us to describe\nthem with precision...\" I was startled: they are part of Gibbon's\n\"Decline and Fall,\" which I easily guessed that she had never read.\n\nI said in a stern voice: \"Where are you?\"\n\nShe replied, \"Us are in a room, eight hundred and eleven miles above. A\nman is writing. Us are reading.\"\n\nI may tell you two things: first, that in trance she never spoke of\nherself as \"I,\" nor even as \"we,\" but, for some unknown reason, in the\n_objective_ way, as \"_us_\": \"us are,\" she would say--\"us will,\" \"us\nwent\"; though, of course, she was an educated lady, and I don't think\never lived in the West of England, where they say \"us\" in that way;\nsecondly, when wandering in the past, she always represented herself as\nbeing \"_above_\" (the earth?), and higher the further back in time she\nwent; in describing present events she appears to have felt herself _on_\n(the earth); while, as regards the future, she invariably declared that\n\"_us_\" were so many miles \"within\" (the earth).\n\nTo her excursions in this last direction, however, there seemed to exist\ncertain fixed limits: I say seemed, for I cannot be sure, and only mean\nthat, in spite of my efforts, she never, in fact, went far in this\ndirection. Three, four thousand \"miles\" were common figures on her lips\nin describing her distance \"above\"; but her distance \"within\" never got\nbeyond sixty-three. Usually, she would say twenty, twenty-five. She\nappeared, in relation to the future, to resemble a diver in the deep\nsea, who, the deeper he strives, finds a more resistant pressure, till,\nat no great depth, resistance becomes prohibition, and he can no further\nstrive.\n\n'I am afraid I can't go on: though I had a good deal to tell you about\nthis lady. During fifteen years, off and on, I sat listening by her dim\nbed-side to her murmuring trances! At last my expert ear could detect\nthe sense of her faintest sigh. I heard the \"Decline and Fall\" from\nbeginning to end. Some of her reports were the most frivolous nonsense:\nover others I have hung in a horror of interest. Certainly, my friend, I\nhave heard some amazing words proceed from those wan lips of Mary\nWilson. Sometimes I could hitch her repeatedly to any scene or subject\nthat I chose by the mere exercise of my will; at others, the flighty\nwaywardness of her spirit eluded and baffled me: she resisted--she\ndisobeyed: otherwise I might have sent you, not four note-books, but\ntwenty, or forty. About the fifth year it struck me that it would be\nwell to jot down her more connected utterances, since I knew shorthand.\n\nThe note-book marked \"I.,\" [1] which seems to me the most curious,\nbelongs to the seventh year. Its history, like those of the other three,\nis this: I heard her one afternoon murmuring in the intonation used when\n_reading_; the matter interested me; I asked her where she was. She\nreplied: \"Us are forty-five miles within: us read, and another writes\";\nfrom which I concluded that she was some fifteen to thirty years in the\nfuture, perusing an as yet unpublished work. After that, during some\nweeks, I managed to keep her to the same subject, and finally, I fancy,\nwon pretty well the whole work. I believe you would find it striking,\nand hope you will be able to read my notes.\n\n'But no more of Mary Wilson now. Rather let us think a little of A.L.\nBrowne, F.R.C.P.!--with a breathing-tube in his trachea, and Eternity\nunder his pillow...' [Dr. Browne's letter then continues on a subject of\nno interest here.]\n\n[The present writer may add that Dr. Browne's prognosis of his own case\nproved correct, for he passed away two days after writing the above. My\ntranscription of the shorthand book marked 'III.' I now proceed to give\nwithout comment, merely reminding the reader that the words form the\nsubstance of a book or document to be written, or to be motived\n(according to Miss Wilson) in that Future, which, no less than the Past,\nsubstantively exists in the Present--though, like the Past, we see it\nnot. I need only add that the title, division into paragraphs, &c., have\nbeen arbitrarily contrived by myself for the sake of form and\nconvenience.]\n\n\n[Footnote 1: This I intend to publish under the title of 'The Last\nMiracle; 'II.' will bear that of 'The Lord of the Sea'; the present book\nis marked 'III.' The perusal of 'IV.' I have yet finished, but so far do\nnot consider it suitable for publication.]\n\n\n\n\n(_Here begins the note-book marked 'III.'_)\n\n\n\n\nTHE PURPLE CLOUD\n\n\nWell, the memory seems to be getting rather impaired now, rather weak.\nWhat, for instance, was the name of that parson who preached, just\nbefore the _Boreal_ set out, about the wickedness of any further attempt\nto reach the North Pole? I have forgotten! Yet four years ago it was\nfamiliar to me as my own name.\n\nThings which took place before the voyage seem to be getting a little\ncloudy in the memory now. I have sat here, in the loggia of this Cornish\nvilla, to write down some sort of account of what has happened--God\nknows why, since no eye can ever read it--and at the very beginning I\ncannot remember the parson's name.\n\nHe was a strange sort of man surely, a Scotchman from Ayrshire, big and\ngaunt, with tawny hair. He used to go about London streets in shough\nand rough-spun clothes, a plaid flung from one shoulder. Once I saw him\nin Holborn with his rather wild stalk, frowning and muttering to\nhimself. He had no sooner come to London, and opened chapel (I think in\nFetter Lane), than the little room began to be crowded; and when, some\nyears afterwards, he moved to a big establishment in Kensington, all\nsorts of men, even from America and Australia, flocked to hear the\nthunderstorms that he talked, though certainly it was not an age apt to\nfly into enthusiasms over that species of pulpit prophets and\nprophecies. But this particular man undoubtedly did wake the strong dark\nfeelings that sleep in the heart; his eyes were very singular and\npowerful; his voice from a whisper ran gathering, like snow-balls, and\ncrashed, as I have heard the pack-ice in commotion far yonder in the\nNorth; while his gestures were as uncouth and gawky as some wild man's\nof the primitive ages.\n\nWell, this man--what _was_ his name?--Macintosh? Mackay? I think--yes,\nthat was it! _Mackay_. Mackay saw fit to take offence at the new attempt\nto reach the Pole in the _Boreal_; and for three Sundays, when the\npreparations were nearing completion, stormed against it at Kensington.\n\nThe excitement of the world with regard to the North Pole had at this\ndate reached a pitch which can only be described as _fevered_, though\nthat word hardly expresses the strange ecstasy and unrest which\nprevailed: for the abstract interest which mankind, in mere desire for\nknowledge, had always felt in this unknown region, was now, suddenly, a\nthousand and a thousand times intensified by a new, concrete interest--a\ntremendous _money_ interest.\n\nAnd the new zeal had ceased to be healthy in its tone as the old zeal\nwas: for now the fierce demon Mammon was making his voice heard in this\nmatter.\n\nWithin the ten years preceding the _Boreal_ expedition, no less than\ntwenty-seven expeditions had set out, and failed.\n\nThe secret of this new rage lay in the last will and testament of Mr.\nCharles P. Stickney of Chicago, that king of faddists, supposed to be\nthe richest individual who ever lived: he, just ten years before the\n_Boreal_ undertaking, had died, bequeathing 175 million dollars to the\nman, of whatever nationality, who first reached the Pole.\n\nSuch was the actual wording of the will--_'the man who first reached'_:\nand from this loose method of designating the person intended had\nimmediately burst forth a prolonged heat of controversy in Europe and\nAmerica as to whether or no the testator meant _the Chief_ of the first\nexpedition which reached: but it was finally decided, on the highest\nlegal authority, that, in any case, the actual wording of the document\nheld good: and that it was the individual, whatever his station in the\nexpedition, whose foot first reached the 90th degree of north latitude,\nwho would have title to the fortune.\n\nAt all events, the public ferment had risen, as I say, to a pitch of\npositive fever; and as to the _Boreal_ in particular, the daily progress\nof her preparations was minutely discussed in the newspapers, everyone\nwas an authority on her fitting, and she was in every mouth a bet, a\nhope, a jest, or a sneer: for now, at last, it was felt that success was\nprobable. So this Mackay had an acutely interested audience, if a\nsomewhat startled, and a somewhat cynical, one.\n\nA truly lion-hearted man this must have been, after all, to dare\nproclaim a point-of-view so at variance with the spirit of his age! One\nagainst four hundred millions, they bent one way, he the opposite,\nsaying that they were wrong, all wrong! People used to call him 'John\nthe Baptist Redivivus': and without doubt he did suggest something of\nthat sort. I suppose that at the time when he had the face to denounce\nthe _Boreal_ there was not a sovereign on any throne in Europe who, but\nfor shame, would have been glad of a subordinate post on board.\n\nOn the third Sunday night of his denunciation I was there in that\nKensington chapel, and I heard him. And the wild talk he talked! He\nseemed like a man delirious with inspiration.\n\nThe people sat quite spell-bound, while Mackay's prophesying voice\nranged up and down through all the modulations of thunder, from the\nhurrying mutter to the reverberant shock and climax: and those who came\nto scoff remained to wonder.\n\nPut simply, what he said was this: That there was undoubtedly some sort\nof Fate, or Doom, connected with the Poles of the earth in reference to\nthe human race: that man's continued failure, in spite of continual\nefforts, to reach them, abundantly and super-abundantly proved this; and\nthat this failure constituted a lesson--_and a warning_--which the race\ndisregarded at its peril.\n\nThe North Pole, he said, was not so very far away, and the difficulties\nin the way of reaching it were not, on the face of them, so very great:\nhuman ingenuity had achieved a thousand things a thousand times more\ndifficult; yet in spite of over half-a-dozen well-planned efforts in\nthe nineteenth century, and thirty-one in the twentieth, man had never\nreached: always he had been baulked, baulked, by some seeming\nchance--some restraining Hand: and herein lay the lesson--_herein the\nwarning_. Wonderfully--really _wonderfully_--like the Tree of\nKnowledge in Eden, he said, was that Pole: all the rest of earth lying\nopen and offered to man--but _That_ persistently veiled and 'forbidden.'\nIt was as when a father lays a hand upon his son, with: 'Not here, my\nchild; wheresoever you will--but not here.'\n\nBut human beings, he said, were free agents, with power to stop their\nears, and turn a callous consciousness to the whispers and warning\nindications of Heaven; and he believed, he said, that the time was now\ncome when man would find it absolutely in his power to stand on that\n90th of latitude, and plant an impious right foot on the head of the\nearth--just as it had been given into the absolute power of Adam to\nstretch an impious right hand, and pluck of the Fruit of Knowledge; but,\nsaid he--his voice pealing now into one long proclamation of awful\naugury--just as the abuse of that power had been followed in the one\ncase by catastrophe swift and universal, so, in the other, he warned the\nentire race to look out thenceforth for nothing from God but a lowering\nsky, and thundery weather.\n\nThe man's frantic earnestness, authoritative voice, and savage gestures,\ncould not but have their effect upon all; as for me, I declare, I sat as\nthough a messenger from Heaven addressed me. But I believe that I had\nnot yet reached home, when the whole impression of the discourse had\npassed from me like water from a duck's back. The Prophet in the\ntwentieth century was not a success. John Baptist himself, camel-skin\nand all, would, have met with only tolerant shrugs. I dismissed Mackay\nfrom my mind with the thought: 'He is behind his age, I suppose.'\n\nBut haven't I thought differently of Mackay since, my God...?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThree weeks--it was about that--before that Sunday night discourse, I\nwas visited by Clark, the chief of the coming expedition--a mere visit\nof friendship. I had then been established about a year at No. II,\nHarley Street, and, though under twenty-five, had, I suppose, as _\u00c3\u00a9lite_\na practice as any doctor in Europe.\n\n_\u00c3\u0089lite_--but small. I was able to maintain my state, and move among the\ngreat: but now and again I would feel the secret pinch of\nmoneylessness. Just about that time, in fact, I was only saved from\nconsiderable embarrassment by the success of my book, 'Applications of\nScience to the Arts.'\n\nIn the course of conversation that afternoon, Clark said to me in his\nlight hap-hazard way:\n\n'Do you know what I dreamed about you last night, Adam Jeffson? I\ndreamed that you were with us on the expedition.'\n\nI think he must have seen my start: on the same night I had myself\ndreamed the same thing; but not a word said I about it now. There was a\nstammer in my tongue when I answered:\n\n'Who? I?--on the expedition?--I would not go, if I were asked.'\n\n'Oh, you would.'\n\n'I wouldn't. You forget that I am about to be married.'\n\n'Well, we need not discuss the point, as Peters is not going to die,'\nsaid he. 'Still, if anything did happen to him, you know, it is you I\nshould come straight to, Adam Jeffson.'\n\n'Clark, you jest,' I said: 'I know really very little of astronomy, or\nmagnetic phenomena. Besides, I am about to be married....'\n\n'But what about your botany, my friend? _There's_ what we should be\nwanting from you: and as for nautical astronomy, poh, a man with your\nscientific habit would pick all that up in no time.'\n\n'You discuss the matter as gravely as though it were a possibility,\nClark,' I said, smiling. 'Such a thought would never enter my head:\nthere is, first of all, my _fianc\u00c3\u00a9e_----'\n\n'Ah, the all-important Countess, eh?--Well, but she, as far as I know\nthe lady, would be the first to force you to go. The chance of stamping\none's foot on the North Pole does not occur to a man every day, my son.'\n\n'Do talk of something else!' I said. 'There is Peters....'\n\n'Well, of course, there is Peters. But believe me, the dream I had was\nso clear----'\n\n'Let me alone with your dreams, and your Poles!' I laughed.\n\nYes, I remember: I pretended to laugh loud! But my secret heart knew,\neven _then_, that one of those crises was occurring in my life which,\nfrom my youth, has made it the most extraordinary which any creature of\nearth ever lived. And I knew that this was so, firstly, because of the\ntwo dreams, and secondly, because, when Clark was gone, and I was\ndrawing on my gloves to go to see my _fianc\u00c3\u00a9e_, I heard distinctly the\nold two Voices talk within me: and One said: 'Go not to see her now!'\nand the Other: 'Yes, go, go!'\n\nThe two Voices of my life! An ordinary person reading my words would\nundoubtedly imagine that I mean only two ordinary contradictory\nimpulses--or else that I rave: for what modern man could comprehend how\nreal-seeming were those voices, how loud, and how, ever and again, I\nheard them contend within me, with a nearness 'nearer than breathing,'\nas it says in the poem, and 'closer than hands and feet.'\n\nAbout the age of seven it happened first to me. I was playing one summer\nevening in a pine-wood of my father's; half a mile away was a\nquarry-cliff; and as I played, it suddenly seemed as if someone said to\nme, inside of me: 'Just take a walk toward the cliff'; and as if someone\nelse said: 'Don't go that way at all'--mere whispers then, which\ngradually, as I grew up, seemed to swell into cries of wrathful\ncontention! I did go toward the cliff: it was steep, thirty feet high,\nand I fell. Some weeks later, on recovering speech, I told my astonished\nmother that 'someone had pushed me' over the edge, and that someone else\n'had caught me' at the bottom!\n\nOne night, soon after my eleventh birthday, lying in bed, the thought\nstruck me that my life must be of great importance to some thing or\nthings which I could not see; that two Powers, which hated each other,\nmust be continually after me, one wishing for some reason to kill me,\nand the other for some reason to keep me alive, one wishing me to do so\nand so, and the other to do the opposite; that I was not a boy like\nother boys, but a creature separate, special, marked for--something.\nAlready I had notions, touches of mood, passing instincts, as occult and\nprimitive, I verily believe, as those of the first man that stepped; so\nthat such Biblical expressions as 'The Lord spake to So-and-so, saying'\nhave hardly ever suggested any question in my mind as to how the Voice\nwas heard: I did not find it so very difficult to comprehend that\noriginally man had more ears than two; nor should have been surprised to\nknow that I, in these latter days, more or less resembled those primeval\nones.\n\nBut not a creature, except perhaps my mother, has ever dreamed me what I\nhere state that I was. I seemed the ordinary youth of my time, bow in my\n'Varsity eight, cramming for exams., dawdling in clubs. When I had to\ndecide as to a profession, who could have suspected the conflict that\ntransacted itself in my soul, while my brain was indifferent to the\nmatter--that agony of strife with which the brawling voices shouted, the\none: 'Be a scientist--a doctor,' and the other: 'Be a lawyer, an\nengineer, an artist--be _anything_ but a doctor!'\n\nA doctor I became, and went to what had grown into the greatest of\nmedical schools--Cambridge; and there it was that I came across a man,\nnamed Scotland, who had a rather odd view of the world. He had rooms, I\nremember, in the New Court at Trinity, and a set of us were generally\nthere. He was always talking about certain 'Black' and 'White Powers,\ntill it became absurd, and the men used to call him\n'black-and-white-mystery-man,' because, one day, when someone said\nsomething about 'the black mystery of the universe,' Scotland\ninterrupted him with the words: 'the black-and-white mystery.'\n\nQuite well I remember Scotland now--the sweetest, gentle soul he was,\nwith a passion for cats, and Sappho, and the Anthology, very short in\nstature, with a Roman nose, continually making the effort to keep his\nneck straight, and draw his paunch in. He used to say that the universe\nwas being frantically contended for by two Powers: a White and a Black;\nthat the White was the stronger, but did not find the conditions on our\nparticular planet very favourable to his success; that he had got the\nbest of it up to the Middle Ages in Europe, but since then had been\nslowly and stubbornly giving way before the Black; and that finally the\nBlack would win--not everywhere perhaps, but _here_--and would carry\noff, if no other earth, at least _this_ one, for his prize.\n\nThis was Scotland's doctrine, which he never tired of repeating; and\nwhile others heard him with mere toleration, little could they divine\nwith what agony of inward interest, I, cynically smiling there, drank in\nhis words. Most profound, most profound, was the impression they made\nupon me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut I was saying that when Clark left me, I was drawing on my gloves to\ngo to see my _fianc\u00c3\u00a9e_, the Countess Clodagh, when I heard the two\nvoices most clearly.\n\nSometimes the urgency of one or other impulse is so overpowering, that\nthere is no resisting it: and it was so then with the one that bid me\ngo.\n\nI had to traverse the distance between Harley Street and Hanover Square,\nand all the time it was as though something shouted at my physical ear:\n'Since you go, breathe no word of the _Boreal_, and Clark's visit'; and\nanother shout: 'Tell, tell, hide nothing!'\n\nIt seemed to last a month: yet it was only some minutes before I was in\nHanover Square, and Clodagh in my arms.\n\nShe was, in my opinion, the most superb of creatures, Clodagh--that\nhaughty neck which seemed always scorning something just behind her left\nshoulder. Superb! but ah--I know it now--a godless woman, Clodagh, a\nbitter heart.\n\nClodagh once confessed to me that her favourite character in history was\nLucrezia Borgia, and when she saw my horror, immediately added: 'Well,\nno, I am only joking!' Such was her duplicity: for I see now that she\nlived in the constant effort to hide her heinous heart from me. Yet, now\nI think of it, how completely did Clodagh enthral me!\n\nOur proposed marriage was opposed by both my family and hers: by mine,\nbecause her father and grandfather had died in lunatic asylums; and by\nhers, because, forsooth, I was neither a rich nor a noble match. A\nsister of hers, much older than herself, had married a common country\ndoctor, Peters of Taunton, and this so-called _m\u00c3\u00a9salliance_ made the\nso-called _m\u00c3\u00a9salliance_ with me doubly detestable in the eyes of her\nrelatives. But Clodagh's extraordinary passion for me was to be stemmed\nneither by their threats nor prayers. What a flame, after all, was\nClodagh! Sometimes she frightened me.\n\nShe was at this date no longer young, being by five years my senior, as\nalso, by five years, the senior of her nephew, born from the marriage of\nher sister with Peters of Taunton. This nephew was Peter Peters, who was\nto accompany the _Boreal_ expedition as doctor, botanist, and\nmeteorological assistant.\n\nOn that day of Clark's visit to me I had not been seated five minutes\nwith Clodagh, when I said:\n\n'Dr. Clark--ha! ha! ha!--has been talking to me about the Expedition. He\nsays that if anything happened to Peters, I should be the first man he\nwould run to. He has had an absurd dream...'\n\nThe consciousness that filled me as I uttered these words was the\n_wickedness_ of me--the crooked wickedness. But I could no more help it\nthan I could fly.\n\nClodagh was standing at a window holding a rose at her face. For quite a\nminute she made no reply. I saw her sharp-cut, florid face in profile,\nsteadily bent and smelling. She said presently in her cold, rapid way:\n\n'The man who first plants his foot on the North Pole will certainly be\nennobled. I say nothing of the many millions... I only wish that I was\na man!'\n\n'I don't know that I have any special ambition that way,' I rejoined. 'I\nam very happy in my warm Eden with my Clodagh. I don't like the outer\nCold.'\n\n'Don't let me think little of you!' she answered pettishly.\n\n'Why should you, Clodagh? I am not bound to desire to go to the North\nPole, am I?'\n\n'But you _would_ go, I suppose, if you could?'\n\n'I might--I--doubt it. There is our marriage....'\n\n'Marriage indeed! It is the one thing to transform our marriage from a\nsneaking difficulty to a ten times triumphant event.'\n\n'You mean if _I_ personally were the first to stand at the Pole. But\nthere are many in an expedition. It is very unlikely that _I_,\npersonally--'\n\n'For _me_ you will, Adam--' she began.\n\n'\"_Will_,\" Clodagh?' I cried. 'You say \"_will_\"? there is not even the\nslightest shadow of a probability--!'\n\n'But why? There are still three weeks before the start. They say...'\n\nShe stopped, she stopped.\n\n'They say what?'\n\nHer voice dropped:\n\n'That Peter takes atropine.'\n\nAh, I started then. She moved from the window, sat in a rocking-chair,\nand turned the leaves of a book, without reading. We were silent, she\nand I; I standing, looking at her, she drawing the thumb across the\nleaf-edges, and beginning again, contemplatively. Then she laughed dryly\na little--a dry, mad laugh.\n\n'Why did you start when I said that?' she asked, reading now at random.\n\n'_I_! I did not start, Clodagh! What made you think that I started? I\ndid not start! Who told you, Clodagh, that Peters takes atropine?'\n\n'He is my nephew: I should know. But don't look dumbfoundered in that\nabsurd fashion: I have no intention of poisoning him in order to see you\na multimillionaire, and a Peer of the Realm....'\n\n'My dearest Clodagh!'\n\n'I easily might, however. He will be here presently. He is bringing Mr.\nWilson for the evening.' (Wilson was going as electrician of the\nexpedition.)\n\n'Clodagh.' I said, 'believe me, you jest in a manner which does not\nplease me.'\n\n'Do I really?' she answered with that haughty, stiff half-turn of her\nthroat: 'then I must be more exquisite. But, thank Heaven, it is only a\njest. Women are no longer admired for doing such things.'\n\n'Ha! ha! ha!--no--no longer admired, Clodagh! Oh, my good Lord! let us\nchange this talk....'\n\nBut now she could talk of nothing else. She got from me that afternoon\nthe history of all the Polar expeditions of late years, how far they\nreached, by what aids, and why they failed. Her eyes shone; she listened\neagerly. Before this time, indeed, she had been interested in the\n_Boreal_, knew the details of her outfitting, and was acquainted with\nseveral members of the expedition. But now, suddenly, her mind seemed\nwholly possessed, my mention of Clark's visit apparently setting her\nwell a-burn with the Pole-fever.\n\nThe passion of her kiss as I tore myself from her embrace that day I\nshall not forget. I went home with a pretty heavy heart.\n\nThe house of Dr. Peter Peters was three doors from mine, on the opposite\nside of the street. Toward one that night, his footman ran to knock me\nup with the news that Peters was very ill. I hurried to his bed-side,\nand knew by the first glance at his deliriums and his staring pupils\nthat he was poisoned with atropine. Wilson, the electrician, who had\npassed the evening with him at Clodagh's in Hanover Square, was there.\n\n'What on earth is the matter?' he said to me.\n\n'Poisoned,' I answered.\n\n'Good God! what with?'\n\n'Atropine.'\n\n'Good Heavens!'\n\n'Don't be frightened: I think he will recover.'\n\n'Is that certain?'\n\n'Yes, I think--that is, if he leaves off taking the drug, Wilson.'\n\n'What! it is he who has poisoned himself?'\n\nI hesitated, I hesitated. But I said:\n\n'He is in the habit of taking atropine, Wilson.'\n\nThree hours I remained there, and, God knows, toiled hard for his life:\nand when I left him in the dark of the fore-day, my mind was at rest: he\nwould recover.\n\nI slept till 11 A.M., and then hurried over again to Peters. In the room\nwere my two nurses, and Clodagh.\n\nMy beloved put her forefinger to her lips, whispering:\n\n'Sh-h-h! he is asleep....'\n\nShe came closer to my ear, saying:\n\n'I heard the news early. I am come to stay with him, till--the last....'\n\nWe looked at each other some time--eye to eye, steadily, she and I: but\nmine dropped before Clodagh's. A word was on my mouth to say, but I said\nnothing.\n\nThe recovery of Peters was not so steady as I had expected. At the end\nof the first week he was still prostrate. It was then that I said to\nClodagh:\n\n'Clodagh, your presence at the bed-side here somehow does not please me.\nIt is so unnecessary.'\n\n'Unnecessary certainly,' she replied: 'but I always had a genius for\nnursing, and a passion for watching the battles of the body. Since no\none objects, why should you?'\n\n'Ah!... I don't know. This is a case that I dislike. I have half a mind\nto throw it to the devil.'\n\n'Then do so.'\n\n'And you, too--go home, go home, Clodagh!'\n\n'But _why_?--if one does no harm. In these days of \"the corruption of\nthe upper classes,\" and Roman decadence of everything, shouldn't every\ninnocent whim be encouraged by you upright ones who strive against the\ntide? Whims are the brakes of crimes: and this is mine. I find a\nsensuous pleasure, almost a sensual, in dabbling in delicate drugs--like\nHelen, for that matter, and Medea, and Calypso, and the great antique\nwomen, who were all excellent chymists. To study the human ship in a\ngale, and the slow drama of its foundering--isn't that a quite thrilling\ndistraction? And I want you to get into the habit at once of letting me\nhave my little way----'\n\nNow she touched my hair with a lofty playfulness that soothed me: but\neven then I looked upon the rumpled bed, and saw that the man there was\nreally very sick.\n\nI have still a nausea to write about it! Lucrezia Borgia in her own age\nmay have been heroic: but Lucrezia in this late century! One could retch\nup the heart...\n\nThe man grew sick on that bed, I say. The second week passed, and only\nten days remained before the start of the expedition.\n\nAt the end of that second week, Wilson, the electrician, was one evening\nsitting by Peter's bedside when I entered.\n\nAt the moment, Clodagh was about to administer a dose to Peters; but\nseeing me, she put down the medicine-glass on the night table, and came\ntoward me; and as she came, I saw a sight which stabbed me: for Wilson\ntook up the deposited medicine-glass, elevated it, looked at it,\nsmelled into it: and he did it with a kind of hurried, light-fingered\nstealth; and he did it with an under-look, and a meaningness of\nexpression which, I thought, proved mistrust....\n\nMeantime, Clark came each day. He had himself a medical degree, and\nabout this time I called him in professionally, together with Alleyne of\nCavendish Square, to consultation over Peters. The patient lay in a\nsemi-coma broken by passionate vomitings, and his condition puzzled us\nall. I formally stated that he took atropine--had been originally\npoisoned by atropine: but we saw that his present symptoms were not\natropine symptoms, but, it almost seemed, of some other vegetable\npoison, which we could not precisely name.\n\n'Mysterious thing,' said Clark to me, when we were alone.\n\n'_I_ don't understand it,' I said.\n\n'Who are the two nurses?'\n\n'Oh, highly recommended people of my own.'\n\n'At any rate, my dream about you comes true, Jeffson. It is clear that\nPeters is out of the running now.'\n\nI shrugged.\n\n'I now formally invite you to join the expedition,' said Clark: 'do you\nconsent?'\n\nI shrugged again.\n\n'Well, if that means consent,' he said, 'let me remind you that you have\nonly eight days, and all the world to do in them.'\n\nThis conversation occurred in the dining-room of Peters' house: and as\nwe passed through the door, I saw Clodagh gliding down the passage\noutside--rapidly--away from us.\n\nNot a word I said to her that day about Clark's invitation. Yet I asked\nmyself repeatedly: Did she not know of it? Had she not _listened_, and\nheard?\n\nHowever that was, about midnight, to my great surprise, Peters opened\nhis eyes, and smiled. By noon the next day, his fine vitality, which so\nfitted him for an Arctic expedition, had re-asserted itself. He was then\nleaning on an elbow, talking to Wilson, and except his pallor, and\nstrong stomach-pains, there was now hardly a trace of his late approach\nto death. For the pains I prescribed some quarter-grain tablets of\nsulphate of morphia, and went away.\n\nNow, David Wilson and I never greatly loved each other, and that very\nday he brought about a painful situation as between Peters and me, by\ntelling Peters that I had taken his place in the expedition. Peters, a\ntouchy fellow, at once dictated a letter of protest to Clark; and Clark\nsent Peters' letter to me, marked with a big note of interrogation in\nblue pencil.\n\nNow, all Peters' preparations were made, mine not; and he had six days\nin which to recover himself. I therefore wrote to Clark, saying that the\nchanged circumstances of course annulled my acceptance of his offer,\nthough I had already incurred the inconvenience of negotiating with a\n_locum tenens_.\n\nThis decided it: Peters was to go, I stay. The fifth day before the\ndeparture dawned. It was a Friday, the 15th June. Peters was now in an\narm-chair. He was cheerful, but with a fevered pulse, and still the\nstomach-pains. I was giving him three quarter-grains of morphia a day.\nThat Friday night, at 11 P.M., I visited him, and found Clodagh there,\ntalking to him. Peters was smoking a cigar.\n\n'Ah,' Clodagh said, 'I was waiting for you, Adam. I didn't know whether\nI was to inject anything to-night. Is it Yes or No?'\n\n'What do you think, Peters?' I said: 'any more pains?'\n\n'Well, perhaps you had better give us another quarter,' he answered:\n'there's still some trouble in the tummy off and on.'\n\n'A quarter-grain, then, Clodagh, 'I said.\n\nAs she opened the syringe-box, she remarked with a pout:\n\n'Our patient has been naughty! He has taken some more atropine.'\n\nI became angry at once.\n\n'Peters,' I cried, 'you know you have no right to be doing things like\nthat without consulting me! Do that once more, and I swear I have\nnothing further to do with you!'\n\n'Rubbish,' said Peters: 'why all this unnecessary heat? It was a mere\nflea-bite. I felt that I needed it.'\n\n'He injected it with his own hand...' remarked Clodagh.\n\nShe was now standing at the mantel-piece, having lifted the syringe-box\nfrom the night-table, taken from its velvet lining both the syringe and\nthe vial containing the morphia tablets, and gone to the mantel-piece to\nmelt one of the tablets in a little of the distilled water there. Her\nback was turned upon us, and she was a long time. I was standing; Peters\nin his arm-chair, smoking. Clodagh then began to talk about a Charity\nBazaar which she had visited that afternoon.\n\nShe was long, she was long. The crazy thought passed through some dim\nregion of my soul: 'Why is she so _long_?'\n\n'Ah, that was a pain!' went Peters: 'never mind the bazaar, aunt--think\nof the morphia.'\n\nSuddenly an irresistible impulse seized me--to rush upon her, to dash\nsyringe, tabloids, glass, and all, from her hands. I _must_ have obeyed\nit--I was on the tip-top point of obeying--my body already leant prone:\nbut at that instant a voice at the opened door behind me said:\n\n'Well, how is everything?'\n\nIt was Wilson, the electrician, who stood there. With lightning\nswiftness I remembered an under-look of mistrust which I had once seen\non his face. Oh, well, I would not, and could not!--she was my love--I\nstood like marble...\n\nClodagh went to meet Wilson with frank right hand, in the left being the\nfragile glass containing the injection. My eyes were fastened on her\nface: it was full of reassurance, of free innocence. I said to myself:\n'I must surely be mad!'\n\nAn ordinary chat began, while Clodagh turned up Peters' sleeve, and,\nkneeling there, injected his fore-arm. As she rose, laughing at\nsomething said by Wilson, the drug-glass dropped from her hand, and her\nheel, by an apparent accident, trod on it. She put the syringe among a\nnumber of others on the mantel-piece.\n\n'Your friend has been naughty, Mr. Wilson,' she said again with that\nsame pout: 'he has been taking more atropine.'\n\n'Not really?' said Wilson.\n\n'Let me alone, the whole of you,' answered Peters: 'I ain't a child.'\n\nThese were the last intelligible words he ever spoke. He died shortly\nbefore 1 A.M. He had been poisoned by a powerful dose of atropine.\n\nFrom that moment to the moment when the _Boreal_ bore me down the\nThames, all the world was a mere tumbling nightmare to me, of which\nhardly any detail remains in my memory. Only I remember the inquest, and\nhow I was called upon to prove that Peters had himself injected himself\nwith atropine. This was corroborated by Wilson, and by Clodagh: and the\nverdict was in accordance.\n\nAnd in all that chaotic hurry of preparation, three other things only,\nbut those with clear distinctness now, I remember.\n\nThe first--and chief--is that tempest of words which I heard at\nKensington from that big-mouthed Mackay on the Sunday night. What was it\nthat led me, busy as I was, to that chapel that night? Well, perhaps I\nknow.\n\nThere I sat, and heard him: and most strangely have those words of his\nperoration planted themselves in my brain, when, rising to a passion of\nprophecy, he shouted: 'And as in the one case, transgression was\nfollowed by catastrophe swift and universal, so, in the other, I warn\nthe entire race to look out thenceforth for nothing from God but a\nlowering sky, and thundery weather.'\n\nAnd this second thing I remember: that on reaching home, I walked into\nmy disordered library (for I had had to hunt out some books), where I\nmet my housekeeper in the act of rearranging things. She had apparently\nlifted an old Bible by the front cover to fling it on the table, for as\nI threw myself into a chair my eye fell upon the open print near the\nbeginning. The print was very large, and a shaded lamp cast a light upon\nit. I had been hearing Mackay's wild comparison of the Pole with the\ntree of Eden, and that no doubt was the reason why such a start\nconvulsed me: for my listless eyes had chanced to rest upon some words.\n\n'The woman gave me of the tree, and I did eat....'\n\nAnd a third thing I remember in all that turmoil of doubt and flurry:\nthat as the ship moved down with the afternoon tide a telegram was put\ninto my hand; it was a last word from Clodagh; and she said only this:\n\n'Be first--for Me.'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Boreal_ left St. Katherine's Docks in beautiful weather on the\nafternoon of the 19th June, full of good hope, bound for the Pole.\n\nAll about the docks was one region of heads stretched far in innumerable\nvagueness, and down the river to Woolwich a continuous dull roar and\nmurmur of bees droned from both banks to cheer our departure.\n\nThe expedition was partly a national affair, subvented by Government:\nand if ever ship was well-found it was the _Boreal_. She had a frame\ntougher far than any battle-ship's, capable of ramming some ten yards of\ndrift-ice; and she was stuffed with sufficient pemmican, codroe,\nfish-meal, and so on, to last us not less than six years.\n\nWe were seventeen, all told, the five Heads (so to speak) of the\nundertaking being Clark (our Chief), John Mew (commander), Aubrey\nMaitland (meteorologist), Wilson (electrician), and myself (doctor,\nbotanist, and assistant meteorologist).\n\nThe idea was to get as far east as the 100\u00c2\u00b0, or the 120\u00c2\u00b0, of longitude;\nto catch there the northern current; to push and drift our way\nnorthward; and when the ship could no further penetrate, to leave her\n(either three, or else four, of us, on ski), and with sledges drawn by\ndogs and reindeer make a dash for the Pole.\n\nThis had also been the plan of the last expedition--that of the\n_Nix_--and of several others. The _Boreal_ only differed from the _Nix_,\nand others, in that she was a thing of nicer design, and of more\nexquisite forethought.\n\nOur voyage was without incident up to the end of July, when we\nencountered a drift of ice-floes. On the 1st August we were at Kabarova,\nwhere we met our coal-ship, and took in a little coal for emergency,\nliquid air being our proper motor; also forty-three dogs, four reindeer,\nand a quantity of reindeer-moss; and two days later we turned our bows\nfinally northward and eastward, passing through heavy 'slack' ice under\nsail and liquid air in crisp weather, till, on the 27th August, we lay\nmoored to a floe off the desolate island of Taimur.\n\nThe first thing which we saw here was a bear on the shore, watching for\nyoung white-fish: and promptly Clark, Mew, and Lamburn (engineer) went\non shore in the launch, I and Maitland following in the pram, each party\nwith three dogs.\n\nIt was while climbing away inland that Maitland said to me:\n\n'When Clark leaves the ship for the dash to the Pole, it is three, not\ntwo, of us, after all, that he is going to take with him, making a party\nof four.'\n\n_I_: 'Is that so? Who knows?'\n\n_Maitland_: 'Wilson does. Clark has let it out in conversation with\nWilson.'\n\n_I_: 'Well, the more the merrier. Who will be the three?'\n\n_Maitland_: 'Wilson is sure to be in it, and there may be Mew, making\nthe third. As to the fourth, I suppose _I_ shall get left out in the\ncold.'\n\n_I_: 'More likely I.'\n\n_Maitland_: 'Well, the race is between us four: Wilson, Mew, you and I.\nIt is a question of physical fitness combined with special knowledge.\nYou are too lucky a dog to get left out, Jeffson.'\n\n_I_: 'Well, what does it matter, so long as the expedition as a whole is\nsuccessful? That is the main thing.'\n\n_Maitland_: 'Oh yes, that's all very fine talk, Jeffson! But is it quite\nsincere? Isn't it rather a pose to affect to despise $175,000,000? _I_\nwant to be in at the death, and I mean to be, if I can. We are all more\nor less self-interested.'\n\n'Look,' I whispered--'a bear.'\n\nIt was a mother and cub: and with determined trudge she came wagging her\nlow head, having no doubt smelled the dogs. We separated on the\ninstant, doubling different ways behind ice-boulders, wanting her to go\non nearer the shore, before killing; but, passing close, she spied, and\nbore down at a trot upon me. I fired into her neck, and at once, with a\nroar, she turned tail, making now straight in Maitland's direction. I\nsaw him run out from cover some hundred yards away, aiming his long-gun:\nbut no report followed: and in half a minute he was under her fore-paws,\nshe striking out slaps at the barking, shrinking dogs. Maitland roared\nfor my help: and at that moment, I, poor wretch, in far worse plight\nthan he, stood shivering in ague: for suddenly one of those wrangles of\nthe voices of my destiny was filling my bosom with loud commotion, one\nurging me to fly to Maitland's aid, one passionately commanding me be\nstill. But it lasted, I believe, some seconds only: I ran and got a shot\ninto the bear's brain, and Maitland leapt up with a rent down his face.\n\nBut singular destiny! Whatever I did--if I did evil, if I did good--the\nresult was the same: tragedy dark and sinister! Poor Maitland was doomed\nthat voyage, and my rescue of his life was the means employed to make\nhis death the more certain.\n\nI think that I have already written, some pages back, about a man\ncalled Scotland, whom I met at Cambridge. He was always talking about\ncertain 'Black' and 'White' beings, and their contention for the earth.\nWe others used to call him the black-and-white mystery-man, because, one\nday--but that is no matter now. Well, with regard to all that, I have a\nfancy, a whim of the mind--quite wide of the truth, no doubt--but I have\nit here in my brain, and I will write it down now. It is this: that\nthere may have been some sort of arrangement, or understanding, between\nBlack and White, as in the case of Adam and the fruit, that, should\nmankind force his way to the Pole and the old forbidden secret biding\nthere, then some mishap should not fail to overtake the race of man;\nthat the White, being kindly disposed to mankind, did not wish this to\noccur, and intended, for the sake of the race, to destroy our entire\nexpedition before it reached; and that the Black, knowing that the White\nmeant to do this, and by what means, used me--_me_!--to outwit this\ndesign, first of all working that I should be one of the party of four\nto leave the ship on ski.\n\nBut the childish attempt, my God, to read the immense riddle of the\nworld! I could laugh loud at myself, and at poor Black-and-White\nScotland, too. The thing can't be so simple.\n\nWell, we left Taimur the same day, and good-bye now to both land and\nopen sea. Till we passed the latitude of Cape Chelyuskin (which we did\nnot sight), it was one succession of ice-belts, with Mew in the\ncrow's-nest tormenting the electric bell to the engine-room, the anchor\nhanging ready to drop, and Clark taking soundings. Progress was slow,\nand the Polar night gathered round us apace, as we stole still onward\nand onward into that blue and glimmering land of eternal frore. We now\nleft off bed-coverings of reindeer-skin and took to sleeping-bags. Eight\nof the dogs had died by the 25th September, when we were experiencing\n19\u00c2\u00b0 of frost. In the darkest part of our night, the Northern Light\nspread its silent solemn banner over us, quivering round the heavens in\na million fickle gauds.\n\nThe relations between the members of our little crew were\nexcellent--with one exception: David Wilson and I were not good friends.\n\nThere was a something--a tone--in the evidence which he had given at the\ninquest on Peters, which made me mad every time I thought of it. He had\nheard Peters admit just before death that he, Peters, had administered\natropine to himself: and he had had to give evidence of that fact. But\nhe had given it in a most half-hearted way, so much so, that the coroner\nhad asked him: 'What, sir, are you hiding from me?' Wilson had replied:\n'Nothing. I have nothing to tell.'\n\nAnd from that day he and I had hardly exchanged ten words, in spite of\nour constant companionship in the vessel; and one day, standing alone on\na floe, I found myself hissing with clenched fist: 'If he dared suspect\nClodagh of poisoning Peters, I could _kill_ him!'\n\nUp to 78\u00c2\u00b0 of latitude the weather had been superb, but on the night of\nthe 7th October--well I remember it--we experienced a great storm. Our\ntub of a ship rolled like a swing, drenching the whimpering dogs at\nevery lurch, and hurling everything on board into confusion. The\npetroleum-launch was washed from the davits; down at one time to 40\u00c2\u00b0\nbelow zero sank the thermometer; while a high aurora was whiffed into a\ndishevelled chaos of hues, resembling the smeared palette of some\nturbulent painter of the skies, or mixed battle of long-robed seraphim,\nand looking the very symbol of tribulation, tempest, wreck, and\ndistraction. I, for the first time, was sick.\n\nIt was with a dizzy brain, therefore, that I went off watch to my bunk.\nSoon, indeed, I fell asleep: but the rolls and shocks of the ship,\ncombined with the heavy Greenland anorak which I had on, and the state\nof my body, together produced a fearful nightmare, in which I was\nconscious of a vain struggle to move, a vain fight for breath, for the\nsleeping-bag turned to an iceberg on my bosom. Of Clodagh was my gasping\ndream. I dreamed that she let fall, drop by drop, a liquid, coloured\nlike pomegranate-seeds, into a glass of water; and she presented the\nglass to Peters. The draught, I knew, was poisonous as death: and in a\nlast effort to break the bands of that dark slumber, I was conscious, as\nI jerked myself upright, of screaming aloud:\n\n'Clodagh! Clodagh! _Spare the man...!_'\n\nMy eyes, starting with horror, opened to waking; the electric light was\nshining in the cabin; and there stood David Wilson looking at me.\n\nWilson was a big man, with a massively-built, long face, made longer by\na beard, and he had little nervous contractions of the flesh at the\ncheek-bones, and plenty of big freckles. His clinging pose, his smile of\ndisgust, his whole air, as he stood crouching and lurching there, I can\nshut my eyes, and see now.\n\nWhat he was doing in my cabin I did not know. To think, my good God,\nthat he should have been led there just then! This was one of the\nfour-men starboard berths: _his_ was a-port: yet there he was! But he\nexplained at once.\n\n'Sorry to interrupt your innocent dreams, says he: 'the mercury in\nMaitland's thermometer is frozen, and he asked me to hand him his\nspirits-of-wine one from his bunk...'\n\nI did not answer. A hatred was in my heart against this man.\n\nThe next day the storm died away, and either three or four days later\nthe slush-ice between the floes froze definitely. The _Boreal's_ way was\nthus blocked. We warped her with ice-anchors and the capstan into the\nposition in which she should lay up for her winter's drift. This was in\nabout 79\u00c2\u00b0 20' N. The sun had now totally vanished from our bleak sky,\nnot to reappear till the following year.\n\nWell, there was sledging with the dogs, and bear-hunting among the\nhummocks, as the months, one by one, went by. One day Wilson, by far our\nbest shot, got a walrus-bull; Clark followed the traditional pursuit of\na Chief, examining Crustacea; Maitland and I were in a relation of close\nfriendship, and I assisted his meteorological observations in a snow-hut\nbuilt near the ship. Often, through the twenty-four hours, a clear blue\nmoon, very spectral, very fair, suffused all our dim and livid clime.\n\nIt was five days before Christmas that Clark made the great\nannouncement: he had determined, he said, if our splendid northward\ndrift continued, to leave the ship about the middle of next March for\nthe dash to the Pole. He would take with him the four reindeer, all the\ndogs, four sledges, four kayaks, and three companions. The companions\nwhom he had decided to invite were: Wilson, Mew, and Maitland.\n\nHe said it at dinner; and as he said it, David Wilson glanced at my wan\nface with a smile of pleased malice: for _I_ was left out.\n\nI remember well: the aurora that night was in the sky, and at its edge\nfloated a moon surrounded by a ring, with two mock-moons. But all shone\nvery vaguely and far, and a fog, which had already lasted some days,\nmade the ship's bows indistinct to me, as I paced the bridge on my\nwatch, two hours after Clark's announcement.\n\nFor a long time all was very still, save for the occasional whine of a\ndog. I was alone, and it grew toward the end of my watch, when Maitland\nwould succeed me. My slow tread tolled like a passing-bell, and the\nmountainous ice lay vague and white around me, its sheeted ghastliness\nnot less dreadfully silent than eternity itself.\n\nPresently, several of the dogs began barking together, left off, and\nbegan again.\n\nI said to myself; 'There is a bear about somewhere.'\n\nAnd after some five minutes I saw--I thought that I saw--it. The fog\nhad, if anything thickened; and it was now very near the end of my\nwatch.\n\nIt had entered the ship, I concluded, by the boards which slanted from\nan opening in the port bulwarks down to the ice. Once before, in\nNovember, a bear, having smelled the dogs, had ventured on board at\nmidnight: but _then_ there had resulted a perfect hubbub among the dogs.\n_Now_, even in the midst of my excitement, I wondered at their\nquietness, though some whimpered--with fear, I thought. I saw the\ncreature steal forward from the hatchway toward the kennels a-port; and\nI ran noiselessly, and seized the watch-gun which stood always loaded by\nthe companionway.\n\nBy this time, the form had passed the kennels, reached the bows, and now\nwas making toward me on the starboard side. I took aim. Never, I\nthought, had I seen so huge a bear--though I made allowance for the\nmagnifying effect of the fog.\n\nMy finger was on the trigger: and at that moment a deathly shivering\nsickness took me, the wrangling voices shouted at me, with 'Shoot!'\n'Shoot not!' 'Shoot!' Ah well, that latter shout was irresistible. I\ndrew the trigger. The report hooted through the Polar night.\n\nThe creature dropped; both Wilson and Clark were up at once: and we\nthree hurried to the spot.\n\nBut the very first near glance showed a singular kind of bear. Wilson\nput his hand to the head, and a lax skin came away at his touch.... It\nwas Aubrey Maitland who was underneath it, and I had shot him dead.\n\nFor the past few days he had been cleaning skins, among them the skin of\nthe bear from which I had saved him at Taimur. Now, Maitland was a born\npantomimist, continually inventing practical jokes; and perhaps to\nstartle me with a false alarm in the very skin of the old Bruin which\nhad so nearly done for him, he had thrown it round him on finishing its\ncleaning, and so, in mere wanton fun, had crept on deck at the hour of\nhis watch. The head of the bear-skin, and the fog, must have prevented\nhim from seeing me taking aim.\n\nThis tragedy made me ill for weeks. I saw that the hand of Fate was upon\nme. When I rose from bed, poor Maitland was lying in the ice behind the\ngreat camel-shaped hummock near us.\n\nBy the end of January we had drifted to 80\u00c2\u00b0 55'; and it was then that\nClark, in the presence of Wilson, asked me if I would make the fourth\nman, in the place of poor Maitland, for the dash in the spring. As I\nsaid 'Yes, I am willing,' David Wilson spat with a disgusted emphasis. A\nminute later he sighed, with 'Ah, poor Maitland...' and drew in his\nbreath with a _tut! tut!_\n\nGod knows, I had an impulse to spring then and there at his throat, and\nstrangle him: but I curbed myself.\n\nThere remained now hardly a month before the dash, and all hands set to\nwork with a will, measuring the dogs, making harness and seal-skin shoes\nfor them, overhauling sledges and kayaks, and cutting every possible\nounce of weight. But we were not destined, after all, to set out that\nyear. About the 20th February, the ice began to pack, and the ship was\nsubjected to an appalling pressure. We found it necessary to make\ntrumpets of our hands to shout into one another's ears, for the whole\nice-continent was crashing, popping, thundering everywhere in terrific\nupheaval. Expecting every moment to see the _Boreal_ crushed to\nsplinters, we had to set about unpacking provisions, and placing\nsledges, kayaks, dogs and everything in a position for instant flight.\nIt lasted five days, and was accompanied by a tempest from the north,\nwhich, by the end of February, had driven us back south into latitude\n79\u00c2\u00b0 40'. Clark, of course, then abandoned the thought of the Pole for\nthat summer.\n\nAnd immediately afterwards we made a startling discovery: our stock of\nreindeer-moss was found to be somehow ridiculously small. Egan, our\nsecond mate, was blamed; but that did not help matters: the sad fact\nremained. Clark was advised to kill one or two of the deer, but he\npig-headedly refused: and by the beginning of summer they were all dead.\n\nWell, our northward drift recommenced. Toward the middle of February we\nsaw a mirage of the coming sun above the horizon; there were flights of\nArctic petrels and snow-buntings; and spring was with us. In an ice-pack\nof big hummocks and narrow lanes we made good progress all the summer.\n\nWhen the last of the deer died, my heart sank; and when the dogs killed\ntwo of their number, and a bear crushed a third, I was fully expecting\nwhat actually came; it was this: Clark announced that he could now take\nonly two companions with him in the spring: and they were Wilson and\nMew. So once more I saw David Wilson's pleased smile of malice.\n\nWe settled into our second winter-quarters. Again came December, and all\nour drear sunless gloom, made worse by the fact that the windmill would\nnot work, leaving us without the electric light.\n\nAh me, none but those who have felt it could dream of one half the\nmental depression of that long Arctic night; how the soul takes on the\nhue of the world; and without and within is nothing but gloom, gloom,\nand the reign of the Power of Darkness.\n\nNot one of us but was in a melancholic, dismal and dire mood; and on the\n13th December Lamburn, the engineer, stabbed Cartwright, the old\nharpooner, in the arm.\n\nThree days before Christmas a bear came close to the ship, and then\nturned tail. Mew, Wilson, I and Meredith (a general hand) set out in\npursuit. After a pretty long chase we lost him, and then scattered\ndifferent ways. It was very dim, and after yet an hour's search, I was\nreturning weary and disgusted to the ship, when I saw some shadow like a\nbear sailing away on my left, and at the same time sighted a man--I did\nnot know whom--running like a handicapped ghost some little distance to\nthe right. So I shouted out:\n\n'There he is--come on! This way!'\n\nThe man quickly joined me, but as soon as ever he recognised me, stopped\ndead. The devil must have suddenly got into him, for he said:\n\n'No, thanks, Jeffson: alone with you I am in danger of my life....'\n\nIt was Wilson. And I, too, forgetting at once all about the bear,\nstopped and faced him.\n\n'I see,' said I. 'But, Wilson, you are going to explain to me _now_ what\nyou mean, you hear? What _do_ you mean, Wilson?'\n\n'What I say,' he answered deliberately, eyeing me up and down: 'alone\nwith you I am in danger of my life. Just as poor Maitland was, and just\nas poor Peters was. Certainly, you are a deadly beast.'\n\nFury leapt, my God, in my heart. Black as the tenebrous Arctic night was\nmy soul.\n\n'Do you mean,' said I, 'that I want to put you out of the way in order\nto go in your place to the Pole? Is that your meaning, man?'\n\n'That's about my meaning, Jeffson,' says he: 'you are a deadly beast,\nyou know.'\n\n'Stop!' I said, with blazing eye. 'I am going to kill _you_, Wilson--as\nsure as God lives: but I want to hear first. Who _told_ you that I\nkilled Peters?'\n\n'Your lover killed him--with _your_ collusion. Why, I heard you, man, in\nyour beastly sleep, calling the whole thing out. And I was pretty sure\nof it before, only I had no proofs. By God, I should enjoy putting a\nbullet into you, Jeffson!'\n\n'You wrong me--you, you wrong me!' I shrieked, my eyes staring with\nravenous lust for his blood; 'and now I am going to pay you well for it.\n_Look out, you!_'\n\nI aimed my gun for his heart, and I touched the trigger. He held up his\nleft hand.\n\n'Stop,' he said, 'stop.' (He was one of the coolest of men ordinarily.)\n'There is no gallows on the _Boreal_, but Clark could easily rig one for\nyou. I want to kill you, too, because there are no criminal courts up\nhere, and it would be doing a good action for my country. But not\nhere--not now. Listen to me--don't shoot. Later we can meet, when all is\nready, so that no one may be the wiser, and fight it all out.'\n\nAs he spoke I let the gun drop. It was better so. I knew that he was\nmuch the best shot on the ship, and I an indifferent one: but I did not\ncare, I did not care, if I was killed.\n\nIt is a dim, inclement land, God knows: and the spirit of darkness and\ndistraction is there.\n\nTwenty hours later we met behind the great saddle-shaped hummock, some\nsix miles to the S.E. of the ship. We had set out at different times, so\nthat no one might suspect. And each brought a ship's-lantern.\n\nWilson had dug an ice-grave near the hummock, leaving at its edge a\nheap of brash-ice and snow to fill it. We stood separated by an interval\nof perhaps seventy yards, the grave between us, each with a lantern at\nhis feet.\n\nEven so we were mere shadowy apparitions one to the other. The air\nglowered very drearily, and present in my inmost soul were the frills of\ncold. A chill moon, a mere abstraction of light, seemed to hang far\noutside the universe. The temperature was at 55\u00c2\u00b0 below zero, so that we\nhad on wind-clothes over our anoraks, and heavy foot-bandages under our\nLap boots. Nothing but a weird morgue seemed the world, haunted with\ndespondent madness; and exactly like that world about us were the minds\nof us two poor men, full of macabre, bleak, and funereal feelings.\n\nBetween us yawned an early grave for one or other of our bodies.\n\nI heard Wilson cry out:\n\n'Are you ready, Jeffson?'\n\n'Aye, Wilson!' cried I.\n\n'_Then here goes!_' cries he.\n\nEven as he spoke, he fired. Surely, the man was in deadly earnest to\nkill me.\n\nBut his shot passed harmlessly by me: as indeed was only likely: we\nwere mere shadows one to the other.\n\nI fired perhaps ten seconds later than he: but in those ten seconds he\nstood perfectly revealed to me in clear, lavender light.\n\nAn Arctic fire-ball had traversed the sky, showering abroad, a\nsulphurous glamour over the snow-landscape. Before the intenser blue of\nits momentary shine had passed away, I saw Wilson stagger forward, and\ndrop. And him and his lantern I buried deep there under the rubble ice.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the 13th March, nearly three months later, Clark, Mew and I left the\nBoreal in latitude 85\u00c2\u00b0 15'.\n\nWe had with us thirty-two dogs, three sledges, three kayaks, human\nprovisions for 112 days, and dog provisions for 40. Being now about 340\nmiles from the Pole, we hoped to reach it in 43 days, then, turning\nsouth, and feeding living dogs with dead, make either Franz Josef Land\nor Spitzbergen, at which latter place we should very likely come up with\na whaler.\n\nWell, during the first days, progress was very slow, the ice being rough\nand laney, and the dogs behaving most badly, stopping dead at every\ndifficulty, and leaping over the traces. Clark had had the excellent\nidea of attaching a gold-beater's-skin balloon, with a lifting power of\n35 pounds, to each sledge, and we had with us a supply of zinc and\nsulphuric-acid to repair the hydrogen-waste from the bags; but on the\nthird day Mew over-filled and burst his balloon, and I and Clark had to\ncut ours loose in order to equalise weights, for we could neither leave\nhim behind, turn back to the ship, nor mend the bag. So it happened that\nat the end of the fourth day out, we had made only nineteen miles, and\ncould still from a hummock discern afar the leaning masts of the old\nBoreal. Clark led on ski, captaining a sledge with 400 lbs. of\ninstruments, ammunition, pemmican, aleuronate bread; Mew followed, his\nsledge containing provisions only; and last came I, with a mixed\nfreight. But on the third day Clark had an attack of snow-blindness, and\nMew took his place.\n\nPretty soon our sufferings commenced, and they were bitter enough. The\nsun, though constantly visible day and night, gave no heat. Our\nsleeping-bags (Clark and Mew slept together in one, I in another) were\nsoaking wet all the night, being thawed by our warmth; and our fingers,\nunder wrappings of senne-grass and wolf-skin, were always bleeding.\nSometimes our frail bamboo-cane kayaks, lying across the sledges, would\ncrash perilously against an ice-ridge--and they were our one hope of\nreaching land. But the dogs were the great difficulty: we lost six\nmortal hours a day in harnessing and tending them. On the twelfth day\nClark took a single-altitude observation, and found that we were only in\nlatitude 86\u00c2\u00b0 45'; but the next day we passed beyond the furthest point\nyet reached by man, viz. 86\u00c2\u00b0 53', attained by the _Nix_ explorers four\nyears previously.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOur one secret thought now was food, food--our day-long lust for the\neating-time. Mew suffered from 'Arctic thirst.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnder these conditions, man becomes in a few days, not a savage only,\nbut a mere beast, hardly a grade above the bear and walrus. Ah, the ice!\nA long and sordid nightmare was that, God knows.\n\nOn we pressed, crawling our little way across the Vast, upon whose hoar\nsilence, from Eternity until then, Bootes only, and that Great Bear, had\nwatched.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter the eleventh day our rate of march improved: all lanes\ndisappeared, and ridges became much less frequent. By the fifteenth day\nI was leaving behind the ice-grave of David Wilson at the rate of ten to\nthirteen miles a day.\n\nYet, as it were, his arm reached out and touched me, even there.\n\nHis disappearance had been explained by a hundred different guesses on\nthe ship--all plausible enough. I had no idea that anyone connected me\nin any way with his death.\n\nBut on our twenty-second day of march, 140 miles from our goal, he\ncaused a conflagration of rage and hate to break out among us three.\n\nIt was at the end of a march, when our stomachs were hollow, our frames\nready to drop, and our mood ravenous and inflamed. One of Mew's dogs was\nsick: it was necessary to kill it: he asked me to do it.\n\n'Oh,' said I, 'you kill your own dog, of course.'\n\n'Well, I don't know,' he replied, catching fire at once, 'you ought to\nbe used to killing, Jeffson.'\n\n'How do you mean, Mew?' said I with a mad start, for madness and the\nflames of Hell were instant and uppermost in us all: 'you mean because\nmy profession----'\n\n'Profession! damn it, no,' he snarled like a dog: 'go and dig up David\nWilson--I dare say you know where to find him--and he will tell you my\nmeaning, right enough.'\n\nI rushed at once to Clark, who was stooping among the dogs,\nunharnessing: and savagely pushing his shoulder, I exclaimed:\n\n'That beast accuses me of murdering David Wilson!'\n\n'Well?' said Clark.\n\n'I'd split his skull as clean----!'\n\n'Go away, Adam Jeffson, and let me be!' snarled Clark.\n\n'Is that all you've got to say about it, then--you?'\n\n'To the devil with you, man, say I, and let me be!' cried he: 'you know\nyour own conscience best, I suppose.'\n\nBefore this insult I stood with grinding teeth, but impotent. However,\nfrom that moment a deeper mood of brooding malice occupied my spirit.\nIndeed the humour of us all was one of dangerous, even murderous,\nfierceness. In that pursuit of riches into that region of cold, we had\nbecome almost like the beasts that perish.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the 10th April we passed the 89th parallel of latitude, and though\nsick to death, both in spirit and body, pressed still on. Like the lower\nanimals, we were stricken now with dumbness, and hardly once in a week\nspoke a word one to the other, but in selfish brutishness on through a\nreal hell of cold we moved. It is a cursed region--beyond doubt\ncursed--not meant to be penetrated by man: and rapid and awful was the\ndegeneration of our souls. As for me, never could I have conceived that\nsavagery so heinous could brood in a human bosom as now I felt it brood\nin mine. If men could enter into a country specially set apart for the\nhabitation of devils, and there become possessed of evil, as we were so\nwould they be.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs we advanced, the ice every day became smoother; so that, from four\nmiles a day, our rate increased to fifteen, and finally (as the sledges\nlightened) to twenty.\n\nIt was now that we began to encounter a succession of strange-looking\nobjects lying scattered over the ice, whose number continually\nincreased as we proceeded. They had the appearance of rocks, or pieces\nof iron, incrusted with glass-fragments of various colours, and they\nwere of every size. Their incrustations we soon determined to be\ndiamonds, and other precious stones. On our first twenty-mile day Mew\npicked up a diamond-crystal as large as a child's foot, and such objects\nsoon became common. We thus found the riches which we sought, beyond all\ndream; but as the bear and the walrus find them: for ourselves we had\nlost; and it was a loss of riches barren as ashes, for all those\nmillions we would not have given an ounce of fish-meal. Clark grumbled\nsomething about their being meteor-stones, whose ferruginous substance\nhad been lured by the magnetic Pole, and kept from frictional burning in\ntheir fall by the frigidity of the air: and they quickly ceased to\ninterest our sluggish minds, except in so far as they obstructed our\nway.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe had all along had good weather: till, suddenly, on the morning of the\n13th April, we were overtaken by a tempest from the S.W., of such mighty\nand solemn volume that the heart quailed beneath it. It lasted in its\nfull power only an hour, but during that time snatched two of our\nsledges long distances, and compelled us to lie face-downward. We had\ntravelled all the sun-lit night, and were gasping with fatigue; so as\nsoon as the wind allowed us to huddle together our scattered things, we\ncrawled into the sleeping-bags, and instantly slept.\n\nWe knew that the ice was in awful upheaval around us; we heard, as our\neyelids sweetly closed, the slow booming of distant guns, and brittle\ncracklings of artillery. This may have been a result of the tempest\nstirring up the ocean beneath the ice. Whatever it was, we did not care:\nwe slept deep.\n\nWe were within ten miles of the Pole.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn my sleep it was as though someone suddenly shook my shoulder with\nurgent '_Up! up_!' It was neither Clark nor Mew, but a dream merely: for\nClark and Mew, when I started up, I saw lying still in their\nsleeping-bag.\n\nI suppose it must have been about noon. I sat staring a minute, and my\nfirst numb thought was somehow this: that the Countess Clodagh had\nprayed me 'Be first'--for her. Wondrous little now cared I for the\nCountess Clodagh in her far unreal world of warmth--precious little for\nthe fortune which she coveted: millions on millions of fortunes lay\nunregarded around me. But that thought, _Be first!_ was deeply suggested\nin my brain, as if whispered there. Instinctively, brutishly, as the\nGadarean swine rushed down a steep place, I, rubbing my daft eyes,\narose.\n\nThe first thing which my mind opened to perceive was that, while the\ntempest was less strong, the ice was now in extraordinary agitation. I\nlooked abroad upon a vast plain, stretched out to a circular, but waving\nhorizon, and varied by many hillocks, boulders, and sparkling\nmeteor-stones that everywhere tinselled the blinding white, some big as\nhouses, most small as limbs. And this great plain was now rearranging\nitself in a widespread drama of havoc, withdrawing in ravines like\nmutual backing curtsies, then surging to clap together in passionate\nmountain-peaks, else jostling like the Symplegades, fluent and\ninconstant as billows of the sea, grinding itself, piling itself,\npouring itself in cataracts of powdered ice, while here and there I saw\nthe meteor-stones leap spasmodically, in dusts and heaps, like geysers\nor spurting froths in a steamer's wake, a tremendous uproar, meantime,\nfilling all the air. As I stood, I plunged and staggered, and I found\nthe dogs sprawling, with whimperings, on the heaving floor.\n\nI did not care. Instinctively, daftly, brutishly, I harnessed ten of\nthem to my sledge; put on Canadian snow-shoes: and was away\nnorthward--alone.\n\nThe sun shone with a clear, benign, but heatless shining: a ghostly,\nremote, yet quite limpid light, which seemed designed for the lighting\nof other planets and systems, and to strike here by happy chance. A\ngreat wind from the S.W., meantime, sent thin snow-sweepings flying\nnorthward past me.\n\nThe odometer which I had with me had not yet measured four miles, when I\nbegan to notice two things: first that the jewelled meteor-stones were\nnow accumulating beyond all limit, filling my range of vision to the\nnorthern horizon with a dazzling glister: in mounds, and parterres, and\nscattered disconnection they lay, like largesse of autumn leaves, spread\nout over those Elysian fields and fairy uplands of wealth, trillions of\nbillions, so that I had need to steer my twining way among them. Now,\ntoo, I noticed that, but for these stones, all roughness had\ndisappeared, not a trace of the upheaval going on a little further south\nbeing here, for the ice lay positively as smooth as a table before me.\nIt is my belief that this stretch of smooth ice has never, never felt\none shock, or stir, or throe, and reaches right down to the bottom of\nthe deep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd now with a wild hilarity I flew. Gradually, a dizziness, a lunacy,\nhad seized upon me, till finally, up-buoyed on air, and dancing mad, I\nsped, I spun, with grinning teeth that chattered and gibbered, and\neyeballs of distraction: for a Fear, too--most cold and dreadful--had\nits hand of ice upon my heart, I being so alone in that place, face to\nface with the Ineffable: but still with a giddy levity, and a fatal joy,\nand a blind hilarity, on I sped, I spun.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe odometer measured nine miles from my start. I was in the immediate\nneighbourhood of the Pole.\n\nI cannot say when it began, but now I was conscious of a sound in my\nears, distinct and near, a steady sound of splashing, or fluttering,\nresembling the noising of a cascade or brook: and it grew. Forty more\nsteps I took (slide I could not now for the meteorites)--perhaps\nsixty--perhaps eighty: and now, to my sudden horror, I stood by a\ncircular clean-cut lake.\n\nOne minute only, swaying and nodding there, I stood: and then I dropped\ndown flat in swoon.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a hundred years, I suppose, I should never succeed in analysing\n_why_ I swooned: but my consciousness still retains the impression of\nthat horrid thrill. I saw nothing distinctly, for my whole being reeled\nand toppled drunken, like a spinning-top in desperate death-struggle at\nthe moment when it flags, and wobbles dissolutely to fall; but the very\ninstant that my eyes met what was before me, I knew, I knew, that here\nwas the Sanctity of Sanctities, the old eternal inner secret of the Life\nof this Earth, which it was a most burning shame for a man to see. The\nlake, I fancy, must be a mile across, and in its middle is a pillar of\nice, very low and broad; and I had the clear impression, or dream, or\nnotion, that there was a name, or word, graven all round in the ice of\nthe pillar in characters which I could never read; and under the name a\nlong date; and the fluid of the lake seemed to me to be wheeling with a\nshivering ecstasy, splashing and fluttering, round the pillar, always\nfrom west to east, in the direction of the spinning of the earth; and it\nwas borne in upon me--I can't at all say how--that this fluid was the\nsubstance of a living creature; and I had the distinct fancy, as my\nsenses failed, that it was a creature with many dull and anguished eyes,\nand that, as it wheeled for ever round in fluttering lust, it kept its\neyes always turned upon the name and the date graven in the pillar. But\nthis must be my madness....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt must have been not less than an hour before a sense of life returned\nto me; and when the thought stabbed my brain that a long, long time I\nhad lain there in the presence of those gloomy orbs, my spirit seemed to\ngroan and die within me.\n\nIn some minutes, however, I had scrambled to my feet, clutched at a\ndog's harness, and without one backward glance, was flying from that\nplace.\n\nHalf-way to the halting-place, I waited Clark and Mew, being very sick\nand doddering, and unable to advance. But they did not come.\n\nLater on, when I gathered force to go further, I found that they had\nperished in the upheaval of the ice. One only of the sledges, half\nburied, I saw near the spot of our bivouac.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlone that same day I began my way southward, and for five days made\ngood progress. On the eighth day I noticed, stretched right across the\nsouth-eastern horizon, a region of purple vapour which luridly obscured\nthe face of the sun: and day after day I saw it steadily brooding\nthere. But what it could be I did not understand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, onward through the desert ice I continued my lonely way, with a\nbaleful shrinking terror in my heart; for very stupendous, alas! is the\nburden of that Arctic solitude upon one poor human soul.\n\nSometimes on a halt I have lain and listened long to the hollow silence,\nrecoiling, crushed by it, hoping that at least one of the dogs might\nwhine. I have even crept shivering from the thawed sleeping-bag to flog\na dog, so that I might hear a sound.\n\nI had started from the Pole with a well-filled sledge, and the sixteen\ndogs left alive from the ice-packing which buried my comrades. This was\non the evening of the 13th April. I had saved from the wreck of our\nthings most of the whey-powder, pemmican, &c., as well as the\ntheodolite, compass, chronometer, train-oil lamp for cooking, and other\nimplements: I was therefore in no doubt as to my course, and I had\nprovisions for ninety days. But ten days from the start my supply of\ndog-food failed, and I had to begin to slaughter my only companions, one\nby one.\n\nWell, in the third week the ice became horribly rough, and with moil\nand toil enough to wear a bear to death, I did only five miles a day.\nAfter the day's work I would crawl with a dying sigh into the\nsleeping-bag, clad still in the load of skins which stuck to me a mere\nfilth of grease, to sleep the sleep of a swine, indifferent if I never\nwoke.\n\nAlways--day after day--on the south-eastern horizon, brooded sullenly\nthat curious stretched-out region of purple vapour, like the smoke of\nthe conflagration of the world. And I noticed that its length constantly\nreached out and out, and silently grew.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnce I had a very pleasant dream. I dreamed that I was in a garden--an\nArabian paradise--so sweet was the perfume. All the time, however, I had\na sub-consciousness of the gale which was actually blowing from the S.E.\nover the ice, and, at the moment when I awoke, was half-wittedly droning\nto myself; 'It is a Garden of Peaches; but I am not really in the\ngarden: I am really on the ice; only, the S.E. storm is wafting to me\nthe aroma of this Garden of Peaches.'\n\nI opened my eyes--I started--I sprang to my feet! For, of all the\nmiracles!--I could not doubt--an actual aroma like peach-blossom was in\nthe algid air about me!\n\nBefore I could collect my astonished senses, I began to vomit pretty\nviolently, and at the same time saw some of the dogs, mere skeletons as\nthey were, vomiting, too. For a long time I lay very sick in a kind of\ndaze, and, on rising, found two of the dogs dead, and all very queer.\nThe wind had now changed to the north.\n\nWell, on I staggered, fighting every inch of my deplorably weary way.\nThis odour of peach-blossom, my sickness, and the death of the two dogs,\nremained a wonder to me.\n\nTwo days later, to my extreme mystification (and joy), I came across a\nbear and its cub lying dead at the foot of a hummock. I could not\nbelieve my eyes. There she lay on her right side, a spot of dirty-white\nin a disordered patch of snow, with one little eye open, and her\nfierce-looking mouth also; and the cub lay across her haunch, biting\ninto her rough fur. I set to work upon her, and allowed the dogs a\nglorious feed on the blubber, while I myself had a great banquet on the\nfresh meat. I had to leave the greater part of the two carcasses, and I\ncan feel again now the hankering reluctance--quite unnecessary, as it\nturned out--with which I trudged onwards. Again and again I found\nmyself asking: 'Now, what could have killed those two bears?'\n\nWith brutish stolidness I plodded ever on, almost like a walking\nmachine, sometimes nodding in sleep while I helped the dogs, or\nmanouvred the sledge over an ice-ridge, pushing or pulling. On the 3rd\nJune, a month and a half from my start, I took an observation with the\ntheodolite, and found that I was not yet 400 miles from the Pole, in\nlatitude 84\u00c2\u00b0 50'. It was just as though some Will, some Will, was\nobstructing and retarding me.\n\nHowever, the intolerable cold was over, and soon my clothes no longer\nhung stark on me like armour. Pools began to appear in the ice, and\npresently, what was worse, my God, long lanes, across which, somehow, I\nhad to get the sledge. But about the same time all fear of starvation\npassed away: for on the 6th June I came across another dead bear, on the\n7th three, and thenceforth, in rapidly growing numbers, I met not bears\nonly, but fulmars, guillemots, snipes, Ross's gulls, little awks--all,\nall, lying dead on the ice. And never anywhere a living thing, save me,\nand the two remaining dogs.\n\nIf ever a poor man stood shocked before a mystery, it was I now. I had a\nbig fear on my heart.\n\nOn the 2nd July the ice began packing dangerously, and soon another\nstorm broke loose upon me from the S.W. I left off my trek, and put up\nthe silk tent on a five-acre square of ice surrounded by lanes: and\n_again_--for the second time--as I lay down, I smelled that delightful\nstrange odour of peach-blossom, a mere whiff of it, and presently\nafterwards was taken sick. However, it passed off this time in a couple\nof hours.\n\nNow it was all lanes, lanes, alas! yet no open water, and such was the\ndifficulty and woe of my life, that sometimes I would drop flat on the\nice, and sob: 'Oh, no more, no more, my God: here let me die.' The\ncrossing of a lane might occupy ten or twelve entire hours, and then, on\nthe other side I might find another one opening right before me.\nMoreover, on the 8th July, one of the dogs, after a feed on blubber,\nsuddenly died; and there was left me only 'Reinhardt,' a white-haired\nSiberian dog, with little pert up-sticking ears, like a cat's. Him, too,\nI had to kill on coming to open water.\n\nThis did not happen till the 3rd August, nearly four months from the\nPole.\n\nI can't think, my God, that any heart of man ever tholed the appalling\nnightmare and black abysm of sensations in which, during those four\nlong desert months, I weltered: for though I was as a brute, I had a\nman's heart to feel. What I had seen, or dreamed, at the Pole followed\nand followed me; and if I shut my poor weary eyes to sleep, those others\nyonder seemed to watch me still with their distraught and gloomy gaze,\nand in my spinning dark dreams spun that eternal ecstasy of the lake.\n\nHowever, by the 28th July I knew from the look of the sky, and the\nabsence of fresh-water ice, that the sea could not be far; so I set to\nwork, and spent two days in putting to rights the now battered kayak.\nThis done, I had no sooner resumed my way than I sighted far off a\nstreaky haze, which I knew to be the basalt cliffs of Franz Josef Land;\nand in a craziness of joy I stood there, waving my ski-staff about my\nhead, with the senile cheers of a very old man.\n\nIn four days this land was visibly nearer, sheer basaltic cliffs mixed\nwith glacier, forming apparently a great bay, with two small islands in\nthe mid-distance; and at fore-day of the 3rd August I arrived at the\ndefinite edge of the pack-ice in moderate weather at about the\nfreezing-point.\n\nI at once, but with great reluctance, shot Reinhardt, and set to work to\nget the last of the provisions, and the most necessary of the\nimplements, into the kayak, making haste to put out to the toilless\nluxury of being borne on the water, after all the weary trudge. Within\nfourteen hours I was coasting, with my little lug-sail spread, along the\nshore-ice of that land. It was midnight of a calm Sabbath, and low on\nthe horizon smoked the drowsing red sun-ball, as my canvas skiff lightly\nchopped her little way through this silent sea. Silent, silent: for\nneither snort of walrus, nor yelp of fox, nor cry of startled kittiwake,\ndid I hear: but all was still as the jet-black shadow of the cliffs and\nglacier on the tranquil sea: and many bodies of dead things strewed the\nsurface of the water.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I found a little fjord, I went up it to the end where stood a\nstretch of basalt columns, looking like a shattered temple of\nAntediluvians; and when my foot at last touched land, I sat down there a\nlong, long time in the rubbly snow, and silently wept. My eyes that\nnight were like a fountain of tears. For the firm land is health and\nsanity, and dear to the life of man; but I say that the great ungenial\nice is a nightmare, and a blasphemy, and a madness, and the realm of the\nPower of Darkness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI knew that I was at Franz Josef Land, somewhere or other in the\nneighbourhood of C. Fligely (about 82\u00c2\u00b0 N.), and though it was so late,\nand getting cold, I still had the hope of reaching Spitzbergen that\nyear, by alternately sailing all open water, and dragging the kayak over\nthe slack drift-ice. All the ice which I saw was good flat fjord-ice,\nand the plan seemed feasible enough; so after coasting about a little,\nand then three days' good rest in the tent at the bottom of a ravine of\ncolumnar basalt opening upon the shore, I packed some bear and walrus\nflesh, with what artificial food was left, into the kayak, and I set out\nearly in the morning, coasting the shore-ice with sail and paddle. In\nthe afternoon I managed to climb a little way up an iceberg, and made\nout that I was in a bay whose terminating headlands were invisible. I\naccordingly decided to make S.W. by W. to cross it, but, in doing so, I\nwas hardly out of sight of land, when a northern storm overtook me\ntoward midnight; before I could think, the little sail was all but\nwhiffed away, and the kayak upset. I only saved it by the happy chance\nof being near a floe with an ice-foot, which, projecting under the\nwater, gave me foot-hold; and I lay on the floe in a mooning state the\nwhole night under the storm, for I was half drowned.\n\nAnd at once, on recovering myself, I abandoned all thought of whalers\nand of Europe for that year. Happily, my instruments, &c., had been\nsaved by the kayak-deck when she capsized.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA hundred yards inland from the shore-rim, in a circular place where\nthere was some moss and soil, I built myself a semi-subterranean Eskimo\nden for the long Polar night. The spot was quite surrounded by high\nsloping walls of basalt, except to the west, where they opened in a\nthree-foot cleft to the shore, and the ground was strewn with slabs and\nboulders of granite and basalt. I found there a dead she-bear, two\nwell-grown cubs, and a fox, the latter having evidently fallen from the\ncliffs; in three places the snow was quite red, overgrown with a red\nlichen, which at first I took for blood. I did not even yet feel secure\nfrom possible bears, and took care to make my den fairly tight, a work\nwhich occupied me nearly four weeks, for I had no tools, save a hatchet,\nknife, and metal-shod ski-staff. I dug a passage in the ground two feet\nwide, two deep, and ten long, with perpendicular sides, and at its north\nend a circular space, twelve feet across, also with perpendicular sides,\nwhich I lined with stones; the whole excavation I covered with\ninch-thick walrus-hide, skinned during a whole bitter week from four of\na number that lay about the shore-ice; for ridge-pole I used a thin\npointed rock which I found near, though, even so, the roof remained\nnearly flat. This, when it was finished, I stocked well, putting in\neverything, except the kayak, blubber to serve both for fuel and\noccasional light, and foods of several sorts, which I procured by merely\nstretching out the hand. The roof of both circular part and passage was\nsoon buried under snow and ice, and hardly distinguishable from the\ngeneral level of the white-clad ground. Through the passage, if I passed\nin or out, I crawled flat, on hands and knees: but that was rare: and in\nthe little round interior, mostly sitting in a cowering attitude, I\nwintered, harkening to the large and windy ravings of darkling December\nstorms above me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll those months the burden of a thought bowed me; and an unanswered\nquestion, like the slow turning of a mechanism, revolved in my gloomy\nspirit: for everywhere around me lay bears, walruses, foxes, thousands\nupon thousands of little awks, kittiwakes, snow-owls, eider-ducks,\ngulls-dead, dead. Almost the only living things which I saw were some\nwalruses on the drift-floes: but very few compared with the number\nwhich I expected. It was clear to me that some inconceivable catastrophe\nhad overtaken the island during the summer, destroying all life about\nit, except some few of the amphibia, cetacea, and crustacea.\n\nOn the 5th December, having crept out from the den during a southern\nstorm, I had, for the third time, a distant whiff of that self-same\nodour of peach-blossom: but now without any after-effects.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, again came Christmas, the New Year--Spring: and on the 22nd May I\nset out with a well-stocked kayak. The water was fairly open, and the\nice so good, that at one place I could sail the kayak over it, the wind\nsending me sliding at a fine pace. Being on the west coast of Franz\nJosef Land, I was in as favourable a situation as possible, and I turned\nmy bow southward with much hope, keeping a good many days just in sight\nof land. Toward the evening of my third day out I noticed a large flat\nfloe, presenting far-off a singular and lovely sight, for it seemed\nfreighted thick with a profusion of pink and white roses, showing in its\nclear crystal the empurpled reflection. On getting near I saw that it\nwas covered with millions of Ross's gulls, all dead, whose pretty rosy\nbosoms had given it that appearance.\n\nUp to the 29th June I made good progress southward and westward (the\nweather being mostly excellent), sometimes meeting dead bears, floating\naway on floes, sometimes dead or living walrus-herds, with troop after\ntroop of dead kittiwakes, glaucus and ivory gulls, skuas, and every kind\nof Arctic fowl. On that last day--the 29th June--I was about to encamp\non a floe soon after midnight, when, happening to look toward the sun,\nmy eye fell, far away south across the ocean of floes, upon\nsomething--_the masts of a ship_.\n\nA phantom ship, or a real ship: it was all one; real, I must have\ninstantly felt, it could not be: but at a sight so incredible my heart\nset to beating in my bosom as though I must surely die, and feebly\nwaving the cane oar about my head, I staggered to my knees, and thence\nwith wry mouth toppled flat.\n\nSo overpoweringly sweet was the thought of springing once more, like the\nbeasts of Circe, from a walrus into a man. At this time I was tearing my\nbear's-meat just like a bear; I was washing my hands in walrus-blood to\nproduce a glairy sort of pink cleanliness, in place of the black grease\nwhich chronically coated them.\n\nWorn as I was, I made little delay to set out for that ship; and I had\nnot travelled over water and ice four hours when, to my in-describable\njoy, I made out from the top of a steep floe that she was the _Boreal_.\nIt seemed most strange that she should be anywhere hereabouts: I could\nonly conclude that she must have forced and drifted her way thus far\nwestward out of the ice-block in which our party had left her, and\nperhaps now was loitering here in the hope of picking us up on our way\nto Spitzbergen.\n\nIn any case, wild was the haste with which I fought my way to be at her,\nmy gasping mouth all the time drawn back in a _rictus_ of laughter at\nthe anticipation of their gladness to see me, their excitement to hear\nthe grand tidings of the Pole attained. Anon I waved the paddle, though\nI knew that they could not yet see me, and then I dug deep at the\nwhitish water. What astonished me was her main-sail and fore-mast\nsquare-sail--set that calm morning; and her screws were still, for she\nmoved not at all. The sun was abroad like a cold spirit of light,\ntouching the great ocean-room of floes with dazzling spots, and a tint\nalmost of rose was on the world, as it were of a just-dead bride in her\nspangles and white array. The _Boreal_ was the one little distant\njet-black spot in all this purity: and upon her, as though she were\nHeaven, I paddled, I panted. But she was in a queerish state: by 9 A.M.\nI could see that. Two of the windmill arms were not there, and half\nlowered down her starboard beam a boat hung askew; moreover, soon after\n10 I could clearly see that her main-sail had a long rent down the\nmiddle.\n\nI could not at all make her out. She was not anchored, though a\nsheet-anchor hung over at the starboard cathead; she was not moored; and\ntwo small ice-floes, one on each side, were sluggishly bombarding her\nbows.\n\nI began now to wave the paddle, battling for my breath, ecstatic, crazy\nwith excitement, each second like a year to me. Very soon I could make\nout someone at the bows, leaning well over, looking my way. Something\nput it into my head that it was Sallitt, and I began an impassioned\nshouting. 'Hi! Sallitt! Hallo! Hi!' I called.\n\nI did not see him move: I was still a good way off: but there he stood,\nleaning steadily over, looking my way. Between me and the ship now was\nall navigable water among the floes, and the sight of him so visibly\nnear put into me such a shivering eagerness, that I was nothing else but\na madman for the time, sending the kayak flying with venomous digs in\nquick-repeated spurts, and mixing with the diggings my crazy wavings,\nand with both the daft shoutings of 'Hallo! Hi! Bravo! I have _been to\nthe Pole!_'\n\nWell, vanity, vanity. Nearer still I drew: it was broad morning, going\non toward noon: I was half a mile away, I was fifty yards. But on board\nthe _Boreal_, though now they _must_ have heard me, seen me, I observed\nno movement of welcome, but all, all was still as death that still\nArctic morning, my God. Only, the ragged sail flapped a little, and--one\non each side--two ice-floes sluggishly bombarded the bows, with hollow\nsounds.\n\nI was certain now that Sallitt it was who looked across the ice: but\nwhen the ship swung a little round, I noticed that the direction of his\ngaze was carried with her movement, he no longer looking my way.\n\n'Why, Sallitt!' I shouted reproachfully: 'why, Sallitt, man...!' I\nwhined.\n\nBut even as I shouted and whined, a perfect wild certainty was in my\nheart: for an aroma like peach, my God, had been suddenly wafted from\nthe ship upon me, and I must have very well known then that that\nwatchful outlook of Sallitt saw nothing, and on the _Boreal_ were dead\nmen all; indeed, very soon I saw one of his eyes looking like a glass\neye which has slid askew, and glares distraught. And now again my\nwretched body failed, and my head dropped forward, where I sat, upon\nthe kayak-deck.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, after a long time, I lifted myself to look again at that forlorn\nand wandering craft. There she lay, quiet, tragic, as it were culpable\nof the dark secret she bore; and Sallitt, who had been such good friends\nwith me, would not cease his stare. I knew quite well why he was there:\nhe had leant over to vomit, and had leant ever since, his forearms\npressed on the bulwark-beam, his left knee against the boards, and his\nleft shoulder propped on the cathead. When I came quite near, I saw that\nwith every bump of the two floes against the bows, his face shook in\nresponse, and nodded a little; strange to say, he had no covering on his\nhead, and I noted the play of the faint breezes in his uncut hair. After\na time I would approach no more, for I was afraid; I did not dare, the\nsilence of the ship seemed so sacred and awful; and till late afternoon\nI sat there, watching the black and massive hull. Above her water-line\nemerged all round a half-floating fringe of fresh-green sea-weed,\nproving old neglect; an abortive attempt had apparently been made to\nlower, or take in, the larch-wood pram, for there she hung by a jammed\ndavit-rope, stern up, bow in the water; the only two arms of the\nwindmill moved this way and that, through some three degrees, with an\n_andante_ creaking sing-song; some washed clothes, tied on the bow-sprit\nrigging to dry, were still there; the iron casing all round the bluff\nbows was red and rough with rust; at several points the rigging was in\nconsiderable tangle; occasionally the boom moved a little with a\ntortured skirling cadence; and the sail, rotten, I presume, from\nexposure--for she had certainly encountered no bad weather--gave out\nanon a heavy languid flap at a rent down the middle. Besides Sallitt,\nlooking out there where he had jammed himself, I saw no one.\n\nBy a paddle-stroke now, and another presently, I had closely approached\nher about four in the afternoon, though my awe of the ship was\ncomplicated by that perfume of hers, whose fearful effects I knew. My\ntentative approach, however, proved to me, when I remained unaffected,\nthat, here and now, whatever danger there had been was past; and\nfinally, by a hanging rope, with a thumping desperation of heart, I\nclambered up her beam.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey had died, it seemed, very suddenly, for nearly all the twelve were\nin poses of activity. Egan was in the very act of ascending the\ncompanion-way; Lamburn was sitting against the chart-room door,\napparently cleaning two carbines; Odling at the bottom of the\nengine-room stair seemed to be drawing on a pair of reindeer komagar;\nand Cartwright, who was often in liquor, had his arms frozen tight round\nthe neck of Martin, whom he seemed to be kissing, they two lying stark\nat the foot of the mizzen-mast.\n\nOver all--over men, decks, rope-coils--in the cabin, in the\nengine-room--between skylight leaves--on every shelf, in every\ncranny--lay a purplish ash or dust, very impalpably fine. And steadily\nreigning throughout the ship, like the very spirit of death, was that\naroma of peach-blossom.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHere it had reigned, as I could see from the log-dates, from the rust on\nthe machinery, from the look of the bodies, from a hundred indications,\nduring something over a year. It was, therefore, mainly by the random\nworkings of winds and currents that this fragrant ship of death had been\nbrought hither to me.\n\nAnd this was the first direct intimation which I had that the Unseen\nPowers (whoever and whatever they may be), who through the history of\nthe world had been so very, very careful to conceal their Hand from the\neyes of men, hardly any longer intended to be at the pains to conceal\ntheir Hand from me. It was just as though the Boreal had been openly\npresented to me by a spiritual agency, which, though I could not see it,\nI could readily apprehend.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe dust, though very thin and flighty above-decks, lay thickly\ndeposited below, and after having made a tour of investigation\nthroughout the ship, the first thing which I did was to examine\nthat--though I had tasted nothing all day, and was exhausted to death. I\nfound my own microscope where I had left it in the box in my berth to\nstarboard, though I had to lift up Egan to get at it, and to step over\nLamburn to enter the chart-room; but there, toward evening, I sat at the\ntable and bent to see if I could make anything of the dust, while it\nseemed to me as if all the myriad spirits of men that have sojourned on\nthe earth, and angel and devil, and all Time and all Eternity, hung\nsilent round for my decision; and such an ague had me, that for a long\ntime my wandering finger-tips, all ataxic with agitation, eluded every\ndelicate effort which I made, and I could nothing do. Of course, I know\nthat an odour of peach-blossom in the air, resulting in death, could\nonly be associated with some vaporous effluvium of cyanogen, or of\nhydrocyanic ('prussic') acid, or of both; and when I at last managed to\nexamine some of the dust under the microscope, I was not therefore\nsurprised to find, among the general mass of purplish ash, a number of\nbright-yellow particles, which could only be minute crystals of potassic\nferrocyanide. What potassic ferrocyanide was doing on board the _Boreal_\nI did not know, and I had neither the means, nor the force of mind,\nalas! to dive then further into the mystery; I understood only that by\nsome extraordinary means the air of the region just south of the Polar\nenviron had been impregnated with a vapour which was either cyanogen, or\nsome product of cyanogen; also, that this deadly vapour, which is very\nsoluble, had by now either been dissolved by the sea, or else dispersed\ninto space (probably the latter), leaving only its faint after-perfume;\nand seeing this, I let my poor abandoned head drop again on the table,\nand long hours I sat there staring mad, for I had a suspicion, my God,\nand a fear, in my breast.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Boreal,_ I found, contained sufficient provisions, untouched by\nthe dust, in cases, casks, &c., to last me, probably, fifty years. After\ntwo days, when I had partially scrubbed and boiled the filth of fifteen\nmonths from my skin, and solaced myself with better food, I overhauled\nher thoroughly, and spent three more days in oiling and cleaning the\nengine. Then, all being ready, I dragged my twelve dead and laid them\ntogether in two rows on the chart-room floor; and I hoisted for love the\npoor little kayak which had served me through so many tribulations. At\nnine in the morning of the 6th July, a week from my first sighting of\nthe _Boreal_, I descended to the engine-room to set out.\n\nThe screws, like those of most quite modern ships, were driven by the\nsimple contrivance of a constant stream of liquid air, contained in very\npowerful tanks, exploding through capillary tubes into non-expansion\nslide-valve chests, much as in the ordinary way with steam: a motor\nwhich gave her, in spite of her bluff hulk, a speed of sixteen knots. It\nis, therefore, the simplest thing for one man to take these ships round\nthe world, since their movement, or stopping, depend upon nothing but\nthe depressing or raising of a steel handle, provided that one does not\nget blown to the sky meantime, as liquid air, in spite of its thousand\nadvantages, occasionally blows people. At any rate, I had tanks of air\nsufficient to last me through twelve years' voyaging; and there was the\nordinary machine on board for making it, with forty tons of coal, in\ncase of need, in the bunkers, and two excellent Belleville boilers: so I\nwas well supplied with motors at least.\n\nThe ice here was quite slack, and I do not think I ever saw Arctic\nweather so bright and gay, the temperature at 41\u00c2\u00b0. I found that I was\nmidway between Franz Josef and Spitzbergen, in latitude 79\u00c2\u00b0 23' N. and\nlongitude 39\u00c2\u00b0 E.; my way was perfectly clear; and something almost like\na mournful hopefulness was in me as the engines slid into their clanking\nturmoil, and those long-silent screws began to churn the Arctic sea. I\nran up with alacrity and took my stand at the wheel; and the bows of my\neventful Argo turned southward and westward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I needed food or sleep, the ship slept, too: when I awoke, she\ncontinued her way.\n\nSixteen hours a day sometimes I stood sentinel at that wheel,\noverlooking the varied monotony of the ice-sea, till my knees would\ngive, and I wondered why a wheel at which one might sit was not\ncontrived, rather delicate steering being often required among the floes\nand bergs. By now, however, I was less weighted with my ball of Polar\nclothes, and stood almost slim in a Lap great-coat, a round Siberian fur\ncap on my head.\n\nAt midnight when I threw myself into my old berth, it was just as though\nthe engines, subsided now into silence, were a dead thing, and had a\nghost which haunted me; for I heard them still, and yet not them, but\nthe silence of their ghost.\n\nSometimes I would startle from sleep, horrified to the heart at some\nsound of exploding iceberg, or bumping floe, noising far through that\nwhite mystery of quietude, where the floes and bergs were as floating\ntombs, and the world a liquid cemetery. Never could I describe the\nstrange Doom's-day shock with which such a sound would recall me from\nfar depths of chaos to recollection of myself: for often-times, both\nwaking and in nightmare, I did not know on which planet I was, nor in\nwhich Age, but felt myself adrift in the great gulf of time and space\nand circumstance, without bottom for my consciousness to stand upon; and\nthe world was all mirage and a new show to me; and the boundaries of\ndream and waking lost.\n\nWell, the weather was most fair all the time, and the sea like a pond.\nDuring the morning of the fifth day, the 11th July, I entered, and went\nmoving down, an extraordinary long avenue of snow-bergs and floes, most\nregularly placed, half a mile across and miles long, like a Titanic\ndouble-procession of statues, or the Ming Tombs, but rising and sinking\non the cadenced swell; many towering high, throwing placid shadows on\nthe aisle between; some being of a lucid emerald tint; and three or four\npouring down cascades that gave a far and chaunting sound. The sea\nbetween was of a strange thick bluishness, almost like raw egg-white;\nwhile, as always here, some snow-clouds, white and woolly, floated in\nthe pale sky. Down this avenue, which produced a mysterious impression\nof Cyclopean cathedrals and odd sequesteredness, I had not passed a\nmile, when I sighted a black object at the end.\n\nI rushed to the shrouds, and very soon made out a whaler.\n\nAgain the same panting agitations, mad rage to be at her, at once\npossessed me; I flew to the indicator, turned the lever to full, then\nback to give the wheel a spin, then up the main-mast ratlins, waving a\nlong foot-bandage of vadmel tweed picked up at random, and by the time I\nwas within five hundred yards of her, had worked myself to such a pitch,\nthat I was again shouting that futile madness: 'Hullo! Hi! Bravo! _I\nhave been to the Pole!_'\n\nAnd those twelve dead that I had in the chart-room there must have heard\nme, and the men on the whaler must have heard me, and smiled their\nsmile.\n\nFor, as to that whaler, I should have known better at once, if I had not\nbeen crazy, since she _looked_ like a ship of death, her boom slamming\nto port and starboard on the gentle heave of the sea, and her fore-sail\nreefed that serene morning. Only when I was quite near her, and hurrying\ndown to stop the engines, did the real truth, with perfect suddenness,\ndrench my heated brain; and I almost ran into her, I was so stunned.\n\nHowever, I stopped the _Boreal_ in time, and later on lowered the kayak,\nand boarded the other.\n\nThis ship had evidently been stricken silent in the midst of a perfect\ndrama of activity, for I saw not one of her crew of sixty-two who was\nnot busy, except one boy. I found her a good-sized thing of 500 odd\ntons, ship-rigged, with auxiliary engine of seventy horse-power, and\npretty heavily armour-plated round the bows. There was no part of her\nwhich I did not over-haul, and I could see that they had had a great\ntime with whales, for a mighty carcass, attached to the outside of the\nship by the powerful cant-purchase tackle, had been in process of\nflensing and cutting-in, and on the deck two great blankets of blubber,\nlooking each a ton-weight, surrounded by twenty-seven men in many\nattitudes, some terrifying to see, some disgusting, several grotesque,\nall so unhuman, the whale dead, and the men dead, too, and death was\nthere, and the rank-flourishing germs of Inanity, and a mesmerism, and a\nsilence, whose dominion was established, and its reign was growing old.\nFour of them, who had been removing the gums from a mass of stratified\nwhalebone at the mizzen-mast foot, were quite imbedded in whale-flesh;\nalso, in a barrel lashed to the top of the main top-gallant masthead was\nvisible the head of a man with a long pointed beard, looking steadily\nout over the sea to the S.W., which made me notice that five only of the\nprobable eight or nine boats were on board; and after visiting the\n'tween-decks, where I saw considerable quantities of stowed whalebone\nplates, and about fifty or sixty iron oil-tanks, and cut-up blubber; and\nafter visiting cabin, engine-room, fo'cas'le, where I saw a lonely boy\nof fourteen with his hand grasping a bottle of rum under all the\nturned-up clothes in a chest, he, at the moment of death, being\nevidently intent upon hiding it; and after two hours' search of the\nship, I got back to my own, and half an hour later came upon all the\nthree missing whale-boats about a mile apart, and steered zig-zag near\nto each. They contained five men each and a steerer, and one had the\nharpoon-gun fired, with the loose line coiled round and round the head\nand upper part of the stroke line-manager; and in the others hundreds of\nfathoms of coiled rope, with toggle-irons, whale-lances, hand-harpoons,\nand dropped heads, and grins, and lazy _abandon_, and eyes that stared,\nand eyes that dozed, and eyes that winked.\n\nAfter this I began to sight ships not infrequently, and used regularly\nto have the three lights burning all night. On the 12th July I met one,\non the 15th two, on the 16th one, on the 17th three, on the 18th\ntwo--all Greenlanders, I think: but, of the nine, I boarded only three,\nthe glass quite clearly showing me, when yet far off, that on the others\nwas no life; and on the three which I boarded were dead men; so that\nthat suspicion which I had, and that fear, grew very heavy upon me.\n\nI went on southward, day after day southward, sentinel there at my\nwheel; clear sunshine by day, when the calm pale sea sometimes seemed\nmixed with regions of milk, and at night the immense desolation of a\nworld lit by a sun that was long dead, and by a light that was gloom. It\nwas like Night blanched in death then; and wan as the very kingdom of\ndeath and Hades I have seen it, most terrifying, that neuter state and\nlimbo of nothingness, when unreal sea and spectral sky, all boundaries\nlost, mingled in a vast shadowy void of ghastly phantasmagoria, pale to\nutter huelessness, at whose centre I, as if annihilated, seemed to swoon\nin immensity of space. Into this disembodied world would come anon\nwaftures of that peachy scent which I knew: and their frequency rapidly\ngrew. But still the _Boreal_ moved, traversing, as it were, bottomless\nEternity: and I reached latitude 72\u00c2\u00b0, not far now from Northern Europe.\n\nAnd now, as to that blossomy peach-scent--even while some floes were yet\naround me--I was just like some fantastic mariner, who, having set out\nto search for Eden and the Blessed Islands, finds them, and balmy gales\nfrom their gardens come out, while he is yet afar, to meet him with\ntheir perfumes of almond and champac, cornel and jasmin and lotus. For I\nhad now reached a zone where the peach-aroma was constant; all the world\nseemed embalmed in its spicy fragrance; and I could easily imagine\nmyself voyaging beyond the world toward some clime of perpetual and\nenchanting Spring.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, I saw at last what whalers used to call 'the blink of the ice';\nthat is to say, its bright apparition or reflection in the sky when it\nis left behind, or not yet come-to. By this time I was in a region where\na good many craft of various sorts were to be seen; I was continually\nmeeting them; and not one did I omit to investigate, while many I\nboarded in the kayak or the larch-wood pram. Just below latitude 70\u00c2\u00b0 I\ncame upon a good large fleet of what I supposed to be Lafoden cod and\nherring fishers, which must have drifted somewhat on a northward\ncurrent. They had had a great season, for the boats were well laden with\ncuring fish. I went from one to the other on a zig-zag course, they\nbeing widely scattered, some mere dots to the glass on the horizon. The\nevening was still and clear with that astral Arctic clearness, the sun\njust beginning his low-couched nightly drowse. These sturdy-looking\nbrown boats stood rocking gently there with slow-creaking noises, as of\nthings whining in slumber, without the least damage, awaiting the\nappalling storms of the winter months on that tenebrous sea, when a\ndark doom, and a deep grave, would not fail them. The fishers were braw\ncarles, wearing, many of them, fringes of beard well back from the\nchin-point, with hanging woollen caps. In every case I found below-decks\na number of cruses of corn-brandy, marked _aquavit_, two of which I took\ninto the pram. In one of the smacks an elderly fisher was kneeling in a\nforward sprawling pose, clasping the lug-mast with his arms, the two\nknees wide apart, head thrown back, and the yellow eye-balls with their\nislands of grey iris staring straight up the mast-pole. At another of\nthem, instead of boarding in the pram, I shut off the _Boreal's_ liquid\nair at such a point that, by delicate steering, she slackened down to a\nstoppage just a-beam of the smack, upon whose deck I was thus able to\njump down. After looking around I descended the three steps aft into the\ndark and garrety below-decks, and with stooping back went calling in an\nawful whisper: '_Anyone? Anyone?_' Nothing answered me: and when I went\nup again, the _Boreal_ had drifted three yards beyond my reach. There\nbeing a dead calm, I had to plunge into the water, and in that\nhalf-minute there a sudden cold throng of unaccountable terrors beset\nme, and I can feel again now that abysmal desolation of loneliness, and\nsense of a hostile and malign universe bent upon eating me up: for the\nocean seemed to me nothing but a great ghost.\n\nTwo mornings later I came upon another school, rather larger boats\nthese, which I found to be Brittany cod-fishers. Most of these, too, I\nboarded. In every below-decks was a wooden or earthenware image of the\nVirgin, painted in gaudy faded colours; and in one case I found a boy\nwho had been kneeling before the statue, but was toppled sideways now,\nhis knees still bent, and the cross of Christ in his hand. These\nstalwart blue woollen blouses and tarpaulin sou'-westers lay in every\npose of death, every detail of feature and expression still perfectly\npreserved. The sloops were all the same, all, all: with sing-song creaks\nthey rocked a little, nonchalantly: each, as it were, with a certain\nsub-consciousness of its own personality, and callous unconsciousness of\nall the others round it: yet each a copy of the others: the same hooks\nand lines, disembowelling-knives, barrels of salt and pickle, piles and\ncasks of opened cod, kegs of biscuit, and low-creaking rockings, and a\nbilgy smell, and dead men. The next day, about eighty miles south of the\nlatitude of Mount Hekla, I sighted a big ship, which turned out to be\nthe French cruiser _Lazare Tr\u00c3\u00a9port_. I boarded and overhauled her\nduring three hours, her upper, main, and armoured deck, deck by deck, to\nher lowest black depths, even childishly spying up the tubes of her two\nbig, rusted turret-guns. Three men in the engine-room had been much\nmangled, after death, I presume, by a burst boiler; floating about 800\nyards to the north-east lay a long-boat of hers, low in the water,\ncrammed with marines, one oar still there, jammed between the row-lock\nand the rower's forced-back chin; on the ship's starboard deck, in the\nlong stretch of space between the two masts, the blue-jackets had\nevidently been piped up, for they lay there in a sort of serried\ndisorder, to the number of two hundred and seventy-five. Nothing could\nbe of suggestion more tragic than the wasted and helpless power of this\npoor wandering vessel, around whose stolid mass myriads of wavelets,\nbusy as aspen-leaves, bickered with a continual weltering splash that\nwas quite loud to hear. I sat a good time that afternoon in one of her\nsteely port main-deck casemates on a gun-carriage, my head sunken on my\nbreast, furtively eyeing the bluish turned-up feet, all shrunk,\nexsanguined, of a sailor who lay on his back before me; his soles were\nall that I could see, the rest of him lying head-downwards beyond the\nsteel door-sill.\n\nDrenched in seas of lugubrious reverie I sat, till, with a shuddering\nstart, I awoke, paddled back to the _Boreal_, and, till sleep conquered\nme, went on my way. At ten the next morning, coming on deck, I spied to\nthe west a group of craft, and turned my course upon them. They turned\nout to be eight Shetland sixerns, which must have drifted north-eastward\nhither. I examined them well, but they were as the long list of the\nothers: for all the men, and all the boys, and all the dogs on them were\ndead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI could have come to land a long time before I did: but I would not: I\nwas so afraid. For I was used to the silence of the ice: and I was used\nto the silence of the sea: but, God knows it, I was afraid of the\nsilence of the land.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnce, on the 15th July, I had seen a whale, or thought I did, spouting\nvery remotely afar on the S.E. horizon; and on the 19th I distinctly saw\na shoal of porpoises vaulting the sea-surface, in their swift-successive\nmanner, northward: and seeing them, I had said pitifully to myself:\n'Well, I am not quite alone in the world, then, my good God--not quite\nalone.'\n\nMoreover, some days later, the _Boreal_ had found herself in a bank of\ncod making away northward, millions of fish, for I saw them, and one\nafternoon caught three, hand-running, with the hook.\n\nSo the sea, at least, had its tribes to be my mates.\n\nBut if I should find the land as still as the sea, without even the\nspouting whale, or school of tumbling sea-hogs--_if Paris were dumber\nthan the eternal ice_--what then, I asked myself, should I do?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI could have made short work, and landed at Shetland, for I found myself\nas far westward as longitude 11\u00c2\u00b0 23' W.: but I would not: I was so\nafraid. The shrinking within me to face that vague suspicion which I\nhad, turned me first to a foreign land.\n\nI made for Norway, and on the first night of this definite intention, at\nabout nine o'clock, the weather being gusty, the sky lowering, the air\nsombrous, and the sea hard-looking, dark, and ridged, I was steaming\nalong at a good rate, holding the wheel, my poor port and starboard\nlights still burning there, when, without the least notice, I received\nthe roughest physical shock of my life, being shot bodily right over\nthe wheel, thence, as from a cannon, twenty feet to the cabin-door,\nthrough it head-foremost down the companion-way, and still beyond some\nsix yards along the passage. I had crashed into some dark and dead ship,\nprobably of large size, though I never saw her, nor any sign of her; and\nall that night, and the next day till four in the afternoon, the\n_Boreal_ went driving alone over the sea, whither she would: for I lay\nunconscious. When I woke, I found that I had received really very small\ninjuries, considering: but I sat there on the floor a long time in a\nsulky, morose, disgusted, and bitter mood; and when I rose, pettishly\nstopped the ship's engines, seeing my twelve dead all huddled and\ndisfigured. Now I was afraid to steam by night, and even in the daytime\nI would not go on for three days: for I was childishly angry with I know\nnot what, and inclined to quarrel with Those whom I could not see.\n\nHowever, on the fourth day, a rough swell which knocked the ship about,\nand made me very uncomfortable, coaxed me into moving; and I did so with\nbows turned eastward and southward.\n\nI sighted the Norway coast four days later, in latitude 63\u00c2\u00b0 19', at noon\nof the 11th August, and pricked off my course to follow it; but it was\nwith a slow and dawdling reluctance that I went, at much less than\nhalf-speed. In some eight hours, as I knew from the chart, I ought to\nsight the lighthouse light on Smoelen Island; and when quiet night came,\nthe black water being branded with trails of still moonlight, I passed\nquite close to it, between ten and twelve, almost under the shadow of\nthe mighty hills: but, oh my God, no light was there. And all the way\ndown I marked the rugged sea-board slumber darkling, afar or near, with\nnever, alas! one friendly light.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, on the 15th August I had another of those maniac raptures, whose\npassing away would have left an elephant racked and prostrate. During\nfour days I had seen not one sign of present life on the Norway coast,\nonly hills, hills, dead and dark, and floating craft, all dead and dark;\nand my eyes now, I found, had acquired a crazy fixity of stare into the\nvery bottom of the vacant abyss of nothingness, while I remained\nunconscious of being, save of one point, rainbow-blue, far down in the\ninfinite, which passed slowly from left to right before my consciousness\na little way, then vanished, came back, and passed slowly again, from\nleft to right continually; till some prick, or voice, in my brain would\nstartle me into the consciousness that I was staring, whispering the\nprofound confidential warning: _You must not stare so, or it is over\nwith you!_' Well, lost in a blank trance of this sort, I was leaning\nover the wheel during the afternoon of the 15th, when it was as if some\ninstinct or premonition in my soul leapt up, and said aloud: 'If you\nlook just yonder, _you will see...!_' I started, and in one instant had\nsurged up from all that depth of reverie to reality: I glanced to the\nright: and there, at last, my God, I saw something human which moved,\nrapidly moved: at last!--and it came to me.\n\nThat sense of recovery, of waking, of new solidity, of the comfortable\nusual, a million-fold too intense for words--how sweetly consoling it\nwas! Again now, as I write, I can fancy and feel it--the rocky solidity,\nthe adamant ordinary, on which to base the feet, and live. From the day\nwhen I stood at the Pole, and saw there the dizzy thing that made me\nswoon, there had come into my way not one sign or trace that other\nbeings like myself were alive on the earth with me: till now, suddenly,\nI had the sweet indubitable proof: for on the south-western sea, not\nfour knots away, I saw a large, swift ship: and her bows, which were\nsharp as a hatchet, were steadily chipping through the smooth sea at a\npretty high pace, throwing out profuse ribbony foams that went\nwide-vawering, with outward undulations, far behind her length, as she\nran the sea in haste, straight northward.\n\nAt the moment, I was steering about S.E. by S., fifteen miles out from a\nshadowy-blue series of Norway mountains; and just giving the wheel one\nfrantic spin to starboard to bring me down upon her, I flew to the\nbridge, leant my back on the main-mast, which passed through it, put a\nfoot on the white iron rail before me, and there at once felt all the\nmocking devils of distracted revelry possess me, as I caught the cap\nfrom my long hairs, and commenced to wave and wave and wave, red-faced\nmaniac that I was: for at the second nearer glance, I saw that she was\nflying an ensign at the main, and a long pennant at the main-top, and I\ndid not know what she was flying those flags there for: and I was\nembittered and driven mad.\n\nWith distinct minuteness did she print herself upon my consciousness in\nthat five minutes' interval: she was painted a dull and cholera yellow,\nlike many Russian ships, and there was a faded pink space at her bows\nunder the line where the yellow ceased: the ensign at her main I made\nout to be the blue-and-white saltire, and she was clearly a Russian\npassenger-liner, two-masted, two-funnelled, though from her funnels came\nno trace of smoke, and the position of her steam-cones was anywhere. All\nabout her course the sea was spotted with wobbling splendours of the low\nsun, large coarse blots of glory near the eye, but lessening to a\nsmaller pattern in the distance, and at the horizon refined to a\nhomogeneous band of livid silver.\n\nThe double speed of the _Boreal_ and the other, hastening opposite ways,\nmust have been thirty-eight or forty knots, and the meeting was\naccomplished in certainly less than five minutes: yet into that time I\ncrowded years of life. I was shouting passionately at her, my eyes\nstarting from my head, my face all inflamed with rage the most prone,\nloud and urgent. For she did not stop, nor signal, nor make sign of\nseeing me, but came furrowing down upon me like Juggernaut, with\nsteadfast run. I lost reason, thought, memory, purpose, sense of\nrelation, in that access of delirium which transported me, and can only\nremember now that in the midst of my shouting, a word, uttered by the\nfiends who used my throat to express their frenzy, set me laughing high\nand madly: for I was crying: 'Hi! Bravo! Why don't you stop? _Madmen! I\nhave been to the Pole!'_\n\nThat instant an odour arose, and came, and struck upon my brain, most\ndetestable, most execrable; and while one might count ten, I was aware\nof her near-sounding engines, and that cursed charnel went tearing past\nme on her maenad way, not fifteen yards from my eyes and nostrils. She\nwas a thing, my God, from which the vulture and the jackal, prowling for\noffal, would fly with shrieks of loathing. I had a glimpse of decks\npiled thick with her festered dead.\n\nIn big black letters on the round retreating yellow stern my eye-corner\ncaught the word _Yaroslav_, as I bent over the rail to retch and cough\nand vomit at her. She was a horrid thing.\n\nThis ship had certainly been pretty far south in tropical or\nsub-tropical latitudes with her great crowd of dead: for all the bodies\nwhich I had seen till then, so far from smelling ill, seemed to give out\na certain perfume of the peach. She was evidently one of those many\nships of late years which have substituted liquid air for steam, yet\nretained their old steam-funnels, &c., in case of emergency: for air, I\nbelieve, was still looked at askance by several builders, on account of\nthe terrible accidents which it sometimes caused. The _Boreal_ herself\nis a similar instance of both motors. This vessel, the _Yaroslav_, must\nhave been left with working engines when her crew were overtaken by\ndeath, and, her air-tanks being still unexhausted, must have been\nranging the ocean with impunity ever since, during I knew not how many\nmonths, or, it might be, years.\n\nWell, I coasted Norway for nearly a hundred and sixty miles without once\ngoing nearer land than two or three miles: for something held me back.\nBut passing the fjord-mouth where I knew that Aadheim was, I suddenly\nturned the helm to port, almost before I knew that I was doing it, and\nmade for land.\n\nIn half an hour I was moving up an opening in the land with mountains on\neither hand, streaky crags at their summit, umbrageous boscage below;\nand the whole softened, as it were, by veils woven of the rainbow.\n\nThis arm of water lies curved about like a thread which one drops, only\nthe curves are much more pointed, so that every few minutes the scene\nwas changed, though the vessel just crawled her way up, and I could see\nbehind me nothing of what was passed, or only a land-locked gleam like a\nlake.\n\nI never saw water so polished and glassy, like clarid polished marble,\nreflecting everything quite clean-cut in its lucid abysm, over which\nhardly the faintest zephyr breathed that still sun-down; it wimpled\nabout the bluff _Boreal_, which seemed to move as if careful not to\nbruise it, in rich wrinkles and creases, like glycerine, or\ndewy-trickling lotus-oil; yet it was only the sea: and the spectacle\nyonder was only crags, and autumn-foliage and mountain-slope: yet all\nseemed caught-up and chaste, rapt in a trance of rose and purple, and\nmade of the stuff of dreams and bubbles, of pollen-of-flowers, and rinds\nof the peach.\n\nI saw it not only with delight, but with complete astonishment: having\nforgotten, as was too natural in all that long barrenness of ice and\nsea, that anything could be so ethereally fair: yet homely, too, human,\nfamiliar, and consoling. The air here was richly spiced with that peachy\nscent, and there was a Sabbath and a nepenthe and a charm in that place\nat that hour, as it were of those gardens of Hesperus, and fields of\nasphodel, reserved for the spirits of the just.\n\nAlas! but I had the glass at my side, and for me nepenthe was mixed with\na despair immense as the vault of heaven, my good God: for anon I would\ntake it up to spy some perched hut of the peasant, or burg of the\n'bonder,' on the peaks: and I saw no one there; and to the left, at the\nthird marked bend of the fjord, where there is one of those watch-towers\nthat these people used for watching in-coming fish, I spied, lying on a\ncraggy slope just before the tower, a body which looked as if it must\nsurely tumble head-long, but did not. And when I saw that, I felt\ndefinitely, for the first time, that shoreless despair which I alone of\nmen have felt, high beyond the stars, and deep as hell; and I fell to\nstaring again that blank stare of Nirvana and the lunacy of Nothingness,\nwherein Time merges in Eternity, and all being, like one drop of water,\nflies scattered to fill the bottomless void of space, and is lost.\n\nThe _Boreal's_ bow walking over a little empty fishing-boat roused me,\nand a minute later, just before I came to a new promontory and bend, I\nsaw two people. The shore there is some three feet above the water, and\nedged with boulders of rock, about which grows a fringe of shrubs and\nsmall trees: behind this fringe is a path, curving upward through a\nsombre wooded little gorge; and on the path, near the water, I saw a\ndriver of one of those Norwegian sulkies that were called karjolers: he,\non the high front seat, was dead, lying sideways and backwards, with low\nhead resting on the wheel; and on a trunk strapped to a frame on the\naxle behind was a boy, his head, too, resting sideways on the wheel,\nnear the other's; and the little pony was dead, pitched forward on its\nhead and fore-knees, tilting the shafts downward; and some distance from\nthem on the water floated an empty skiff.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I turned the next fore-land, I all at once began to see a number of\ncraft, which increased as I advanced, most of them small boats, with\nsome schooners, sloops, and larger craft, the majority a-ground: and\nsuddenly now I was conscious that, mingling with that delicious odour of\nspring-blossoms--profoundly modifying, yet not destroying it--was\nanother odour, wafted to me on the wings of the very faint land-breeze:\nand 'Man,' I said, 'is decomposing': for I knew it well: it was the\nodour of human corruption.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe fjord opened finally in a somewhat wider basin, shut-in by quite\nsteep, high-towering mountains, which reflected themselves in the water\nto their last cloudy crag: and, at the end of this I saw ships, a quay,\nand a modest, homely old town.\n\nNot a sound, not one: only the languidly-working engines of the\n_Boreal_. Here, it was clear, the Angel of Silence had passed, and his\nscythe mown.\n\nI ran and stopped the engines, and, without anchoring, got down into an\nempty boat that lay at the ship's side when she stopped; and I paddled\ntwenty yards toward the little quay. There was a brigantine with all her\ncourses set, three jibs, stay-sails, square-sails, main and fore-sails,\nand gaff-top-sail, looking hanging and listless in that calm place, and\nwedded to a still copy of herself, mast-downward, in the water; there\nwere three lumber-schooners, a forty-ton steam-boat, a tiny barque, five\nNorway herring-fishers, and ten or twelve shallops: and the\nsailing-craft had all fore-and-aft sails set, and about each, as I\npassed among them, brooded an odour that was both sweet and abhorrent,\nan odour more suggestive of the very genius of mortality--the inner mind\nand meaning of Azrael--than aught that I could have conceived: for all,\nas I soon saw, were crowded with dead.\n\nWell, I went up the old mossed steps, in that strange dazed state in\nwhich one notices frivolous things: I remember, for instance, feeling\nthe lightness of my new clothes: for the weather was quite mild, and the\nday before I had changed to Summer things, having on now only a common\nundyed woollen shirt, the sleeves rolled up, and cord trousers, with a\nbelt, and a cloth cap over my long hair, and an old pair of yellow\nshoes, without laces, and without socks. And I stood on the unhewn\nstones of the edge of the quay, and looked abroad over a largish piece\nof unpaved ground, which lay between the first house-row and the quay.\n\nWhat I saw was not only most woeful, but wildly startling: woeful,\nbecause a great crowd of people had assembled, and lay dead, there; and\nwildly startling, because something in their _tout ensemble_ told me in\none minute why they were there in such number.\n\nThey were there in the hope, and with the thought, to fly westward by\nboat.\n\nAnd the something which told me this was a certain _foreign_ air about\nthat field of the dead as the eye rested on it, something un-northern,\nsouthern, and Oriental.\n\nTwo yards from my feet, as I stepped to the top, lay a group of three:\none a Norway peasant-girl in skirt of olive-green, scarlet stomacher,\nembroidered bodice, Scotch bonnet trimmed with silver lace, and big\nsilver shoe-buckles; the second was an old Norway man in knee-breeches,\nand eighteenth-century small-clothes, and red worsted cap; and the third\nwas, I decided, an old Jew of the Polish Pale, in gaberdine and\nskull-cap, with ear-locks.\n\nI went nearer to where they lay thick as reaped stubble between the\nquay and a little stone fountain in the middle of the space, and I saw\namong those northern dead two dark-skinned women in costly dress, either\nSpanish or Italian, and the yellower mortality of a Mongolian, probably\na Magyar, and a big negro in zouave dress, and some twenty-five obvious\nFrench, and two Morocco fezes, and the green turban of a shereef, and\nthe white of an Ulema.\n\nAnd I asked myself this question: 'How came these foreign stragglers\nhere in this obscure northern town?'\n\nAnd my wild heart answered: 'There has been an impassioned stampede,\nnorthward and westward, of all the tribes of Man. And this that I, Adam\nJeffson, here see is but the far-tossed spray of that monstrous,\ninfuriate flood.'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, I passed up a street before me, careful, careful where I trod. It\nwas not utterly silent, nor was the quay-square, but haunted by a pretty\ndense cloud of mosquitoes, and dreamy twinges of music, like the drawing\nof the violin-bow in elf-land. The street was narrow, pavered, steep,\nand dark; and the sensations with which I, poor bent man, passed\nthrough that dead town, only Atlas, fabled to bear the burden of this\nEarth, could divine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI thought to myself: If now a wave from the Deep has washed over this\nplanetary ship of earth, and I, who alone happened to be in the extreme\nbows, am the sole survivor of that crew?... What then, my God, shall I\ndo?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI felt, I felt, that in this townlet, save the water-gnats of Norway,\nwas no living thing; that the hum and the savour of Eternity filled, and\nwrapped, and embalmed it.\n\nThe houses are mostly of wood, some of them fairly large, with a\n_porte-coch\u00c3\u00a8re_ leading into a semi-circular yard, around which the\nbuilding stands, very steep-roofed, and shingled, in view of the heavy\nsnow-masses of winter. Glancing into one open casement near the ground,\nI saw an aged woman, stout and capped, lie on her face before a very\nlarge porcelain stove; but I paced on without stoppage, traversed\nseveral streets, and came out, as it became dark, upon a piece of\ngrass-land leading downward to a mountain-gorge. It was some distance\nalong this gorge that I found myself sitting the next morning: and how,\nand in what trance, I passed that whole blank night is obliterated from\nmy consciousness. When I looked about with the return of light I saw\nmajestic fir-grown mountains on either hand, almost meeting overhead at\nsome points, deeply shading the mossy gorge. I rose, and careless of\ndirection, went still onward, and walked and walked for hours,\nunconscious of hunger; there was a profusion of wild\nmountain-strawberries, very tiny, which must grow almost into winter, a\nfew of which I ate; there were blue gentianellas, and\nlilies-of-the-valley, and luxuriance of verdure, and a noise of waters.\nOccasionally, I saw little cataracts on high, fluttering like white wild\nrags, for they broke in the mid-fall, and were caught away, and\nscattered; patches also of reaped hay and barley, hung up, in a singular\nway, on stakes six feet high, I suppose to dry; there were perched huts,\nand a seemingly inaccessible small castle or burg, but none of these did\nI enter: and five bodies only I saw in the gorge, a woman with a babe,\nand a man with two small oxen.\n\nAbout three in the afternoon I was startled to find myself there, and\nturned back. It was dark when I again passed through those gloomy\nstreets of Aadheim, making for the quay, and now I felt both my hunger\nand a dropping weariness. I had no thought of entering any house, but\nas I passed by one open _porte-coch\u00c3\u00a8re_, something, I know not what,\nmade me turn sharply in, for my mind had become as fluff on the winds,\nnot working of its own action, but the sport of impulses that seemed\nexternal. I went across the yard, and ascended a wooden spiral stair by\na twilight which just enabled me to pick my way among five or six vague\nforms fallen there. In that confined place fantastic qualms beset me; I\nmounted to the first landing, and tried the door, but it was locked; I\nmounted to the second: the door was open, and with a chill reluctance I\ntook a step inward where all was pitch darkness, the window-stores being\ndrawn. I hesitated: it was very dark. I tried to utter that word of\nmine, but it came in a whisper inaudible to my ears: I tried again, and\nthis time heard myself say: '_anyone_?' At the same time I had made\nanother step forward, and trodden upon a soft abdomen; and at that\ncontact terrors the most cold and ghastly thrilled me through and\nthrough, for it was as though I saw in that darkness the sudden eyeballs\nof Hell and frenzy glare upon me, and with a low gurgle of affright I\nwas gone, helter-skelter down the stairs, treading upon flesh, across\nthe yard, and down the street, with pelting feet, and open arms, and\nsobbing bosom, for I thought that all Aadheim was after me; nor was my\nhorrid haste appeased till I was on board the _Boreal_, and moving down\nthe fjord.\n\nOut to sea, then, I went again; and within the next few days I visited\nBergen, and put in at Stavanger. And I saw that Bergen and Stavanger\nwere dead.\n\nIt was then, on the 19th August, that I turned my bow toward my native\nland.\n\n      *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom Stavanger I steered a straight course for the Humber.\n\nI had no sooner left behind me the Norway coast than I began to meet the\nships, the ships--ship after ship; and by the time I entered the zone\nof the ordinary alternation of sunny day and sunless night, I was moving\nthrough the midst of an incredible number of craft, a mighty and\nwide-spread fleet.\n\nOver all that great expanse of the North Sea, where, in its most\npopulous days of trade, the sailor might perhaps sight a sail or two, I\nhad now at every moment at least ten or twelve within scope of the\nglass, oftentimes as many as forty, forty-five.\n\nAnd very still they lay on a still sea, itself a dead thing, livid as\nthe lips of death; and there was an intensity in the calm that was\nappalling: for the ocean seemed weighted, and the air drugged.\n\nExtremely slow was my advance, for at first I would not leave any ship,\nhowever remotely small, without approaching sufficiently to investigate\nher, at least with the spy-glass: and a strange multitudinous mixture of\nspecies they were, trawlers in hosts, war-ships of every nation, used,\nit seemed, as passenger-boats, smacks, feluccas, liners, steam-barges,\ngreat four-masters with sails, Channel boats, luggers, a Venetian\n_burchiello_, colliers, yachts, _remorqueurs_, training ships, dredgers,\ntwo _dahabeeahs_ with curving gaffs, Marseilles fishers, a Maltese\n_speronare_, American off-shore sail, Mississippi steam-boats, Sorrento\nlug-schooners, Rhine punts, yawls, old frigates and three-deckers,\ncalled to novel use, Stromboli caiques, Yarmouth tubs, xebecs, Rotterdam\nflat-bottoms, floats, mere gunwaled rafts--anything from anywhere that\ncould bear a human freight on water had come, and was here: and all, I\nknew, had been making westward, or northward, or both; and all, I knew,\nwere crowded; and all were tombs, listlessly wandering, my God, on the\nwandering sea with their dead.\n\nAnd so fair was the world about them, too: the brightest suavest autumn\nweather; all the still air aromatic with that vernal perfume of peach:\nyet not so utterly still, but if I passed close to the lee of any\nfloating thing, the spicy stirrings of morning or evening wafted me\nfaint puffs of the odour of mortality over-ripe for the grave.\n\nSo abominable and accursed did this become to me, such a plague and a\nhissing, vague as was the offence, that I began to shun rather than seek\nthe ships, and also I now dropped my twelve, whom I had kept to be my\ncompanions all the way from the Far North, one by one, into the sea: for\nnow I had definitely passed into a zone of settled warmth.\n\nI was convinced, however, that the poison, whatever it might be, had\nsome embalming, or antiseptic, effect upon the bodies: at Aadheim,\nBergen and Stavanger, for instance, where the temperature permitted me\nto go without a jacket, only the merest hints and whiffs of the\nprocesses of dissolution had troubled me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nVery benign, I say, and pleasant to see, was sky and sea during all that\nvoyage: but it was at sun-set that my sense of the wondrously beautiful\nwas roused and excited, in spite of that great burden which I carried.\nCertainly, I never saw sun-sets resembling those, nor could have\nconceived of aught so flamboyant, extravagant, and bewitched: for the\nwhole heaven seemed turned into an arena for warring Hierarchies,\nwarring for the universe, or it was like the wild countenance of God\ndefeated, and flying marred and bloody from His enemies. But many\nevenings I watched with unintelligent awe, believing it but a portent of\nthe un-sheathed sword of the Almighty; till, one morning, a thought\npricked me like a sword, for I suddenly remembered the great sun-sets of\nthe later nineteenth century, witnessed in Europe, America, and, I\nbelieve, over the world, after the eruption of the volcano of Krakatoa.\n\nAnd whereas I had before said to myself: 'If now a wave from the Deep\nhas washed over this planetary ship of earth...,' I said now: 'A\nwave--but not from the Deep: a wave rather which she had reserved, and\nhas spouted, from her own un-motherly entrails...'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had some knowledge of Morse telegraphy, and of the manipulation of\ntape-machines, telegraphic typing-machines, and the ordinary wireless\ntransmitter and coherer, as of most little things of that sort which\ncame within the outskirts of the interest of a man of science; I had\ncollaborated with Professor Stanistreet in the production of a text-book\ncalled 'Applications of Science to the Arts,' which had brought us some\nnotoriety; and, on the whole, the _minutiae_ of modern things were\nstill pretty fresh in my memory. I could therefore have wired from\nBergen or Stavanger, supposing the batteries not run down, to somewhere:\nbut I would not: I was so afraid; afraid lest for ever from nowhere\nshould come one answering click, or flash, or stirring....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI could have made short work, and landed at Hull: but I would not: I was\nso afraid. For I was used to the silence of the ice: and I was used to\nthe silence of the sea: but I was afraid of the silence of England.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI came in sight of the coast on the morning of the 26th August,\nsomewhere about Hornsea, but did not see any town, for I put the helm to\nport, and went on further south, no longer bothering with the\ninstruments, but coasting at hap-hazard, now in sight of land, and now\nin the centre of a circle of sea; not admitting to myself the motive of\nthis loitering slowness, nor thinking at all, but ignoring the\ndeep-buried fear of the to-morrow which I shirked, and instinctively\nhiding myself in to-day. I passed the Wash, I passed Yarmouth,\nFelixstowe. By now the things that floated motionless on the sea were\nbeyond numbering, for I could hardly lower my eyes ten minutes and lift\nthem, without seeing yet another there: so that soon after dusk I, too,\nhad to lie still among them all, till morning: for they lay dark, and to\nmove at any pace would have been to drown the already dead.\n\nWell, I came to the Thames-mouth, and lay pretty well in among the Flats\nand Pan Sands towards eight one evening, not seven miles from Sheppey\nand the North Kent coast: and I did not see any Nore Light, nor Girdler\nLight: and all along the coast I had seen no light: but as to that I\nsaid not one word to myself, not admitting it, nor letting my heart know\nwhat my brain thought, nor my brain know what my heart surmised; but\nwith a daft and mock-mistrustful under-look I would regard the darkling\nland, holding it a sentient thing that would be playing a prank upon a\npoor man like me.\n\nAnd the next morning, when I moved again, my furtive eye-corners were\nvery well aware of the Prince's Channel light-ship, and also the Tongue\nship, for there they were: but I would not look at them at all, nor go\nnear them: for I did not wish to have anything to do with whatever might\nhave happened beyond my own ken, and it was better to look straight\nbefore, seeing nothing, and concerning one's-self with one's-self.\n\nThe next evening, after having gone out to sea again, I was in a little\nto the E. by S. of the North Foreland: and I saw no light there, nor any\nSandhead light; but over the sea vast signs of wreckage, and the coasts\nwere strewn with old wrecked fleets. I turned about S.E., very slowly\nmoving--for anywhere hereabouts hundreds upon hundreds of craft lay dead\nwithin a ten-mile circle of sea--and by two in the fore-day had wandered\nup well in sight of the French cliffs: for I had said: 'I will go and\nsee the light-beam of the great revolving-drum on Calais pier that\nnightly beams half-way over-sea to England.' And the moon shone clear in\nthe southern heaven that morning, like a great old dying queen whose\nCourt swarms distantly from around her, diffident, pale, and tremulous,\nthe paler the nearer; and I could see the mountain-shadows on her spotty\nfull-face, and her misty aureole, and her lights on the sea, as it were\nkisses stolen in the kingdom of sleep; and all among the quiet ships\nmysterious white trails and powderings of light, like palace-corridors\nin some fairy-land forlorn, full of breathless wan whispers, scandals,\nand runnings-to-and-fro, with leers, and agitated last embraces, and\nflight of the princess, and death-bed of the king; and on the N.E.\nhorizon a bank of brown cloud that seemed to have no relation with the\nworld; and yonder, not far, the white coast-cliffs, not so low as at\nCalais near, but arranged in masses separated by vales of sward, each\nwith its wreck: but no light of any revolving-drum I saw.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI could not sleep that night: for all the operations of my mind and body\nseemed in abeyance. Mechanically I turned the ship westward again; and\nwhen the sun came up, there, hardly two miles from me, were the cliffs\nof Dover; and on the crenulated summit of the Castle I spied the Union\nJack hang motionless.\n\nI heard eight, nine o'clock strike in the cabin, and I was still at sea.\nBut some mad, audacious whisper was at my brain: and at 10.30, the 2nd\nSeptember, immediately opposite the Cross Wall Custom House, the\n_Boreal's_ anchor-chain, after a voyage of three years, two months, and\nfourteen days, ran thundering, thundering, through the starboard\nhawse-hole.\n\nAh heaven! but I must have been stark mad to let the anchor go! for the\neffect upon me of that shocking obstreperous hubbub, breaking in upon\nall that cemetery repose that blessed morning, and lasting it seemed a\nyear, was most appalling; and at the sudden racket I stood excruciated,\nwith shivering knees and flinching heart, God knows: for not less\nterrifically uproarious than the clatter of the last Trump it raged and\nraged, and I thought that all the billion dead could not fail to start,\nand rise, at alarum so excessive, and question me with their eyes....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the top of the Cross Wall near I saw a grey crab fearlessly crawl; at\nthe end where the street begins, I saw a single gas-light palely burn\nthat broad day, and at its foot a black man lay on his face, clad only\nin a shirt and one boot; the harbour was almost packed with every sort\nof craft, and on a Calais-Dover boat, eight yards from my stern, which\nmust have left Calais crowded to suffocation, I saw the rotted dead lie\nheaped, she being unmoored, and continually grinding against an anchored\ngreen brig.\n\nAnd when I saw that, I dropped down upon my knees at the capstan, and my\npoor heart sobbed out the frail cry: 'Well, Lord God, Thou hast\ndestroyed the work of Thy hand...'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter a time I got up, went below in a state of somnambulism, took a\npacket of pemmican cakes, leapt to land, and went following the railway\nthat runs from the Admiralty Pier. In an enclosed passage ten yards\nlong, with railway masonry on one side, I saw five dead lie, and could\nnot believe that I was in England, for all were dark-skinned people,\nthree gaudily dressed, and two in flowing white robes. It was the same\nwhen I turned into a long street, leading northward, for here were a\nhundred, or more, and never saw I, except in Constantinople, where I\nonce lived eighteen months, so variegated a mixture of races, black,\nbrunette, brown, yellow, white, in all the shades, some emaciated like\npeople dead from hunger, and, overlooking them all, one English boy with\na clean Eton collar sitting on a bicycle, supported by a lamp-post which\nhis arms clasped, he proving clearly the extraordinary suddenness of the\ndeath which had overtaken them all.\n\nI did not know whither, nor why, I went, nor had I the least idea\nwhether all this was visually seen by me in the world which I had known,\nor in some other, or was all phantasy of my disembodied spirit--for I\nhad the thought that I, too, might be dead since old ages, and my spirit\nwandering now through the universe of space, in which there is neither\nnorth nor south, nor up nor down, nor measure nor relation, nor aught\nwhatever, save an uneasy consciousness of a dream about bottomlessness.\nOf grief or pain, I think, I felt nothing; though I have a sort of\nmemory now that some sound, resembling a sob or groan, though it was\nneither, came at regular clockwork intervals from my bosom during three\nor four days. Meantime, my brain registered like a tape-machine details\nthe most frivolous, the most ludicrous--the name of a street, Strond\nStreet, Snargate Street; the round fur cap--black fur for the side,\nwhite ermine for the top--of a portly Karaite priest on his back, whose\nrobes had been blown to his spread knees, as if lifted and neatly folded\nthere; a violin-bow gripped between the thick, irregular teeth of a\nlittle Spaniard with brushed-back hair and mad-looking eyes; odd shoes\non the foot of a French girl, one black, one brown. They lay in the\nstreet about as numerous as gunners who fall round their carriage, at\nintervals of five to ten feet, the majority--as was the case also in\nNorway, and on the ships--in poses of distraction, with spread arms, or\nwildly distorted limbs, like men who, the instant before death, called\nupon the rocks and hills to cover them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the left I came to an opening in the land, called, I believe, 'The\nShaft,' and into this I turned, climbing a very great number of steps,\nalmost covered at one point with dead: the steps I began to count, but\nleft off, then the dead, and left off. Finally, at the top, which must\nbe even higher than the Castle, I came to a great open space laid out\nwith gravel-walks, and saw fortifications, barracks, a citadel. I did\nnot know the town, except by passings-through, and was surprised at the\nbreadth of view. Between me and the Castle to the east lay the district\nof crowding houses, brick and ragstone, mixed in the distance with vague\nazure haze; and to the right the harbour, the sea, with their ships; and\nvisible around me on the heights seven or eight dead, biting the dust;\nthe sun now high and warm, with hardly a cloud in the sky; and yonder a\nmist, which was the coast of France.\n\nIt seemed too big for one poor man.\n\nMy head nodded. I sat on a bench, black-painted and hard, the seat and\nback of horizontal boards, with intervals; and as I looked, I nodded,\nheavy-headed and weary: for it was too big for me. And as I nodded, with\nforehead propped on my left hand, and the packet of pemmican cakes in my\nright, there was in my head, somehow, an old street-song of my\nchildhood: and I groaned it sleepily, like coronachs and drear funereal\nnenias, dirging; and the packet beat time in my right hand, falling and\nraising, falling heavily and rising, in time.\n\n    I'll buy the ring,\n    You'll rear the kids:\n    Servants to wait on our ting, ting, ting.\n    .   .   .   .   .\n    .   .   .   .   .\n    Ting, ting,\n    Won't we be happy?\n    Ting, ting,\n    That shall be it:\n    I'll buy the ring,\n    You'll rear the kids:\n    Servants to wait on our ting, ting, ting.\n    .   .   .   .   .\n    .   .   .   .   .\n\nSo maundering, I fell forward upon my face, and for twenty-three hours,\nthe living undistinguished from the dead, I slept there.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was awakened by drizzle, leapt up, looked at a silver chronometer\nwhich, attached by a leather to my belt, I carried in my\nbreeches-pocket, and saw that it was 10 A.M. The sky was dark, and a\nmoaning wind--almost a new thing now to me--had arisen.\n\nI ate some pemmican, for I had a reluctance--needless as it turned\nout--to touch any of the thousand luxuries here, sufficient no doubt,\nin a town like Dover alone, to last me five or six hundred years, if I\ncould live so long; and, having eaten, I descended The Shaft, and spent\nthe whole day, though it rained and blustered continually, in wandering\nabout. Reasoning, in my numb way, from the number of ships on the sea, I\nexpected to find the town over-crowded with dead: but this was not so;\nand I should say, at a venture, that not a thousand English, nor fifteen\nthousand foreigners, were in it: for that westward rage and stampede\nmust have operated here also, leaving the town empty but for the ever\nnew-coming hosts.\n\nThe first thing which I did was to go into an open grocer's shop, which\nwas also a post and telegraph office, with the notion, I suppose, to get\na message through to London. In the shop a single gas-light was burning\nits last, and this, with that near the pier, were the only two that I\nsaw: and ghastly enough they looked, transparently wannish, and as it\nwere ashamed, like blinking night-things overtaken by the glare of day.\nI conjectured that they had so burned and watched during months, or\nyears: for they were now blazing diminished, with streaks and rays in\nthe flame, as if by effort, and if these were the only two, they must\nhave needed time to all-but exhaust the works. Before the counter lay a\nfashionably-dressed negro with a number of tied parcels scattered about\nhim, and on the counter an empty till, and behind it a tall thin woman\nwith her face resting sideways in the till, fingers clutching the outer\ncounter-rim, and such an expression of frantic terror as I never saw. I\ngot over the counter to a table behind a wire-gauze, and, like a numb\nfool, went over the Morse alphabet in my mind before touching the\ntransmitting key, though I knew no code-words, and there, big enough to\nbe seen, was the ABC dial, and who was to answer my message I did not\nask myself: for habit was still strong upon me, and my mind refused to\nreason from what I saw to what I did not see; but the moment I touched\nthe key, and peered greedily at the galvanometer-needle at my right, I\nsaw that it did not move, for no current was passing; and with a kind of\nfright, I was up, leapt, and got away from the place, though there was a\ngreat number of telegrams about the receiver which, if I had been in my\nsenses, I would have stopped and read.\n\nTurning the corner of the next street, I saw wide-open the door of a\nsubstantial large house, and went in. From bottom to top there was no\none there, except one English girl, sitting back in an easy-chair in the\ndrawing-room, which was richly furnished with Valenciennes curtains and\nazure-satin things. She was a girl of the lowest class, hardly clad in\nblack rags, and there she lay with hanging jaw, in a very crooked and\nawkward pose, a jemmy at her feet, in her left hand a roll of\nbank-notes, and in her lap three watches. In fact, the bodies which I\nsaw here were, in general, either those of new-come foreigners, or else\nof the very poor, the very old, or the very young.\n\nBut what made me remember this house was that I found here on one of the\nsofas a newspaper: _The Kent Express_; and sitting unconscious of my\ndead neighbour, I pored a long while over what was written there.\n\nIt said in a passage which I tore out and kept:\n\n'Telegraphic communication with Tilsit, Insterburg, Warsaw, Cracow,\nPrzemysl, Gross Wardein, Karlsburg, and many smaller towns lying\nimmediately eastward of the 21st parallel of longitude has ceased during\nthe night. In some at least of them there must have been operators still\nat their duty, undrawn into the great westward-rushing torrent: but as\nall messages from Western Europe have been answered only by that dread\nmysterious silence which, just three months and two days since,\nastounded the world in the case of Eastern New Zealand, we can only\nassume that these towns, too, have been added to the long and mournful\nlist; indeed, after last evening's Paris telegrams we might have\nprophesied with some certainty, not merely their overthrow, but even the\nhour of it: for the rate-uniformity of the slow-riding vapour which is\ntouring our globe is no longer doubtful, and has even been definitely\nfixed by Professor Craven at 100-1\/2 miles per day, or 4 miles 330 yards\nper hour. Its nature, its origin, remains, of course, nothing but matter\nof conjecture: for it leaves no living thing behind it: nor, God knows,\nis that of any moment now to us who remain. The rumour that it is\nassociated with an odour of almonds is declared, on high authority, to\nbe improbable; but the morose purple of its impending gloom has been\nattested by tardy fugitives from the face of its rolling and smoky\nmarch.\n\n'Is this the end? We do not, and cannot, believe it. Will the pure sky\nwhich we to-day see above us be invaded in nine days, or less, by this\nsmoke of the Pit of Darkness? In spite of the assurances of the\nscientists, we still doubt. For, if so, to what purpose that long drama\nof History, in which we seem to see the Hand of the Dramaturgist?\nSurely, the end of a Fifth Act should be obvious, satisfying to one's\nsense of the complete: but History, so far, long as it has been,\nresembles rather a Prologue than a Fifth Act. Can it be that the\nManager, utterly dissatisfied, would sweep all off, and 'hang up' the\npiece for ever? Certainly, the sins of mankind have been as scarlet: and\nif the fair earth which he has turned into Hell, send forth now upon him\nthe smoke of Hell, little the wonder. But we cannot yet believe. There\nis a sparing strain in nature, and through the world, as a thread, is\nspun a silence which smiles, and on the end of events we find placarded\nlarge the words: \"Why were ye afraid?\" A dignified Hope, therefore--even\nnow, when we cower beneath this worldwide shadow of the wings of the\nCondor of Death--becomes us: and, indeed, we see such an attitude among\nsome of the humblest of our people, from whose heart ascends the cry:\n\"Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him.\" Here, therefore, O Lord! O\nLord, look down, and save!\n\n'But even as we thus write of hope, Reason, if we would hear her,\nwhispers us \"fool\": and inclement is the sky of earth. No more ships can\nNew York Harbour contain, and whereas among us men die weekly of\nprivations by the hundred thousand, yonder across the sea they perish by\nthe million: for where the rich are pinched, how can the poor live?\nAlready 700 out of the 1000 millions of our race have perished, and the\nempires of civilisation have crumbled like sand-castles in a horror of\nanarchy. Thousands upon thousands of unburied dead, anticipating the\nmore deliberate doom that comes and smokes, and rides and comes and\ncomes, and does not fail, encumber the streets of London, Manchester,\nLiverpool. The guides of the nation have fled; the father stabs his\nchild, and the wife her husband, for a morsel of food; the fields lie\nwaste; wanton crowds carouse in our churches, universities, palaces,\nbanks and hospitals; we understand that late last night three\nterritorial regiments, the Munster Fusiliers, and the Lotian and East\nLancashire Regiments, riotously disbanded themselves, shooting two\nofficers; infectious diseases, as we all know, have spread beyond limit;\nin several towns the police seem to have disappeared, and, in nearly\nall, every vestige of decency; the results following upon the sudden\nrelease of the convicts appear to be monstrous in the respective\ndistricts; and within three short months Hell seems to have acquired\nthis entire planet, sending forth Horror, like a rabid wolf, and\nDespair, like a disastrous sky, to devour and confound her. Hear,\ntherefore, O Lord, and forgive our iniquities! O Lord, we beseech Thee!\nLook down, O Lord, and spare!'\n\n     *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I had read this, and the rest of the paper, which had one whole\nsheet-side blank, I sat a long hour there, eyeing a little patch of the\npurple ash on a waxed board near the corner where the girl sat with her\ntime-pieces, so useless in her Eternity; and there was not a feeling in\nme, except a pricking of curiosity, which afterwards became morbid and\nravenous, to know something more of that cloud, or smoke, of which this\nman spoke, of its dates, its origin, its nature, its minute details.\nAfterwards, I went down, and entered several houses, searching for more\npapers, but did not find any; then I found a paper-shop which was open,\nwith boards outside, but either it had been deserted, or printing must\nhave stopped about the date of the paper which I had read, for the only\nthree news-papers there were dated long prior, and I did not read them.\n\nNow it was raining, and a blustering autumn day it was, distributing the\nodours of the world, and bringing me continual mixed whiffs of flowers\nand the hateful stench of decay. But I would not mind it much.\n\nI wandered and wandered, till I was tired of spahi and bashi-bazouk, of\nGreek and Catalan, of Russian 'pope' and Coptic abuna, of dragoman and\nCalmuck, of Egyptian maulawi and Afghan mullah, Neapolitan and sheik,\nand the nightmare of wild poses, colours, stuffs and garbs, the\nyellow-green kefie of the Bedouin, shawl-turbans of Baghdad, the\nvoluminous rose-silk tob of women, and face-veils, and stark distorted\nnakedness, and sashes of figured muslin, and the workman's cords, and\nthe red tarboosh. About four, for very weariness, I was sitting on a\ndoor-steep, bent beneath the rain; but soon was up again, fascinated no\ndoubt by this changing bazaar of sameness, its chance combinations and\npermutations, and novelty in monotony. About five I was at a station,\nmarked Harbour Station, in and about which lay a considerable crowd, but\nnot one train. I sat again, and rested, rose and roamed again; soon\nafter six I found myself at another station, called 'Priory'; and here I\nsaw two long trains, both crowded, one on a siding, and one at the\nup-platform.\n\nI examined both engines, and found them of the old boiler steam-type\nwith manholes, heaters, autoclaves, feed-pump, &c., now rare in western\ncountries, except England. In one there was no water, but in that at the\nplatform, the float-lever, barely tilted toward the float, showed that\nthere was some in the boiler. Of this one I overhauled all the\nmachinery, and found it good, though rusted. There was plenty of fuel,\nand oil, which I supplemented from a near shop: and during ninety\nminutes my brain and hands worked with an intelligence as it were\nautomatic, of their own motion. After three journeys across the station\nand street, I saw the fire blaze well, and the manometer move; when the\nlever of the safety-valve, whose load I lightened by half an atmosphere,\nlifted, I jumped down, and tried to disconnect the long string of\ncarriages from the engine: but failed, the coupling being an automatic\narrangement new to me; nor did I care. It was now very dark; but there\nwas still oil for bull's-eye and lantern, and I lit them. I forgot\nnothing. I rolled driver and stoker--the guard was absent--one to the\nplatform, one upon the rails: and I took their place there. At about\n8.30 I ran out from Dover, my throttle-valve pealing high a long\nfalsetto through the bleak and desolate night.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy aim was London. But even as I set out, my heart smote me: I knew\nnothing of the metals, their junctions, facing-points, sidings,\nshuntings, and complexities. Even as to whether I was going toward, or\naway from, London, I was not sure. But just in proportion as my first\ntimorousness of the engine hardened into familiarity and self-sureness,\nI quickened speed, wilfully, with an obstinacy deaf and blind.\n\nFinally, from a mere crawl at first, I was flying at a shocking\nvelocity, while something, tongue in cheek, seemed to whisper me: 'There\nmust be other trains blocking the lines, at stations, in yards, and\neverywhere--it is a maniac's ride, a ride of death, and Flying\nDutchman's frenzy: remember your dark five-deep brigade of passengers,\nwho rock and bump together, and will suffer in a collision.' But with\nmulish stubbornness I thought: 'They wished to go to London'; and on I\nraged, not wildly exhilarated, so far as I can remember, nor lunatic,\nbut feeling the dull glow of a wicked and morose Unreason urge in my\nbosom, while I stoked all blackened at the fire, or saw the vague mass\nof dead horse or cow, running trees and fields, and dark homestead and\ndeep-slumbering farm, flit ghostly athwart the murky air, as the\nhalf-blind saw 'men like trees walking.'\n\nLong, however, it did not last: I could not have been twenty miles from\nDover when, on a long reach of straight lines, I made out before me a\ntarpaulined mass opposite a signal-point: and at once callousness\nchanged to terror within me. But even as I plied the brake, I felt that\nit was too late: I rushed to the gangway to make a wild leap down an\nembankment to the right, but was thrown backward by a quick series of\nrough bumps, caused by eight or ten cattle which lay there across the\nlines: and when I picked myself up, and leapt, some seconds before the\nimpact, the speed must have considerably slackened, for I received no\nfracture, but lay in semi-coma in a patch of yellow-flowered whin on\nlevel ground, and was even conscious of a fire on the lines forty yards\naway, and, all the night, of vague thunder sounding from somewhere.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout five, or half-past, in the morning I was sitting up, rubbing my\neyes, in a dim light mixed with drizzle. I could see that the train of\nmy last night's debauch was a huddled-up chaos of fallen carriages and\ndisfigured bodies. A five-barred gate on my left opened into a hedge,\nand swung with creaks: two yards from my feet lay a little shaggy pony\nwith swollen wan abdomen, the very picture of death, and also about me a\nnumber of dead wet birds.\n\nI picked myself up, passed through the gate, and walked up a row of\ntrees to a house at their end. I found it to be a little country-tavern\nwith a barn, forming one house, the barn part much larger than the\ntavern part. I went into the tavern by a small side-door--behind the\nbar--into a parlour--up a little stair--into two rooms: but no one was\nthere. I then went round into the barn, which was paved with\ncobble-stones, and there lay a dead mare and foal, some fowls, with two\ncows. A ladder-stair led to a closed trap-door in the floor above. I\nwent up, and in the middle of a wilderness of hay saw nine\npeople--labourers, no doubt--five men and four women, huddled together,\nand with them a tin-pail containing the last of some spirit; so that\nthese had died merry.\n\nI slept three hours among them, and afterwards went back to the tavern,\nand had some biscuits of which I opened a new tin, with some ham, jam\nand apples, of which I made a good meal, for my pemmican was gone.\n\nAfterwards I went following the rail-track on foot, for the engines of\nboth the collided trains were smashed. I knew northward from southward\nby the position of the sun: and after a good many stoppages at houses,\nand by railway-banks, I came, at about eleven in the night, to a great\nand populous town.\n\nBy the Dane John and the Cathedral, I immediately recognised it as\nCanterbury, which I knew quite well. And I walked up Castle Street to\nthe High Street, conscious for the first time of that\nregularly-repeated sound, like a sob or groan, which was proceeding from\nmy throat. As there was no visible moon, and these old streets very dim,\nI had to pick my way, lest I should desecrate the dead with my foot, and\nthey all should rise with hue and cry to hunt me. However, the bodies\nhere were not numerous, most, as before, being foreigners: and these,\nscattered about this strict old English burg that mourning dark night,\npresented such a scene of the baneful wrath of God, and all abomination\nof desolation, as broke me quite down at one place, where I stood in\ntravail with jeremiads and sore sobbings and lamentations, crying out\nupon it all, God knows.\n\nOnly when I stood at the west entrance of the Cathedral I could discern,\nspreading up the dark nave, to the lantern, to the choir, a\nphantasmagorical mass of forms: I went a little inward, and striking\nthree matches, peered nearer: the two transepts, too, seemed\ncrowded--the cloister-doorway was blocked--the southwest porch thronged,\nso that a great congregation must have flocked hither shortly before\ntheir fate overtook them.\n\nHere it was that I became definitely certain that the after-odour of the\npoison was not simply lingering in the air, but was being more or less\ngiven off by the bodies: for the blossomy odour of this church actually\novercame that other odour, the whole rather giving the scent of old\nmouldy linens long embalmed in cedars.\n\nWell, away with stealthy trot I ran from the abysmal silence of that\nplace, and in Palace Street near made one of those sudden immoderate\nrackets that seemed to outrage the universe, and left me so woefully\nfaint, decrepit, and gasping for life (the noise of the train was\ndifferent, for there I was flying, but here a captive, and which way I\nran was capture). Passing in Palace Street, I saw a little lampshop, and\nwanting a lantern, tried to get in, but the door was locked; so, after\ngoing a few steps, and kicking against a policeman's truncheon, I\nreturned to break the window-glass. I knew that it would make a fearful\nnoise, and for some fifteen or twenty minutes stood hesitating: but\nnever could I have dreamed, my good God, of _such_ a noise, so\npassionate, so dominant, so divulgent, and, O Heaven, so long-lasting:\nfor I seemed to have struck upon the weak spot of some planet, which\ncame suddenly tumbling, with protracted bellowing and _d\u00c3\u00a9b\u00c3\u00a2cle_, about\nmy ears. It was a good hour before I would climb in; but then quickly\nfound what I wanted, and some big oil-cans; and till one or two in the\nmorning, the innovating flicker of my lantern went peering at random\ninto the gloomy nooks of the town.\n\nUnder a deep old Gothic arch that spanned a pavered alley, I saw the\nlittle window of a little house of rubble, and between the two\ndiamond-paned sashes rags tightly beaten in, the idea evidently being to\nmake the place air-tight against the poison. When I went in I found the\ndoor of that room open, though it, too, apparently, had been stuffed at\nthe edges; and on the threshold an old man and woman lay low. I\nconjectured that, thus protected, they had remained shut in, till either\nhunger, or the lack of oxygen in the used-up air, drove them forth,\nwhereupon the poison, still active, must have instantly ended them. I\nfound afterwards that this expedient of making air-tight had been widely\nresorted to; and it might well have proved successful, if both the\nsupply of inclosed air, and of food, had been anywhere commensurate with\nthe durability of the poisonous state.\n\nWeary, weary as I grew, some morbid persistence sustained me, and I\nwould not rest. About four in the morning I was at a station again,\nindustriously bending, poor wretch, at the sooty task of getting another\nengine ready for travel. This time, when steam was up, I succeeded in\nuncoupling the carriages from the engine, and by the time morning\nbroke, I was lightly gliding away over the country, whither I did not\nknow, but making for London.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow I went with more intelligence and caution, and got on very well,\ntravelling seven days, never at night, except it was very clear, never\nat more than twenty or twenty-five miles, and crawling through tunnels.\nI do not know the maze into which the train took me, for very soon after\nleaving Canterbury it must have gone down some branch-line, and though\nthe names were marked at stations, that hardly helped me, for of their\nsituation relatively to London I was seldom sure. Moreover, again and\nagain was my progress impeded by trains on the metals, when I would have\nto run back to a shunting-point or a siding, and, in two instances,\nthese being far behind, changed from my own to the impeding engine. On\nthe first day I travelled unhindered till noon, when I stopped in open\ncountry that seemed uninhabited for ages, only that half a mile to the\nleft, on a shaded sward, was a large stone house of artistic design,\ncoated with tinted harling, the roof of red Ruabon tiles, and timbered\ngables. I walked to it after another row with putting out the fire and\narranging for a new one, the day being bright and mild, with great\nmasses of white cloud in the sky. The house had an outer and an inner\nhall, three reception rooms, fine oil-paintings, a kind of museum, and a\nlarge kitchen. In a bed-room above-stairs I found three women with\nservants' caps, and a footman, arranged in a strange symmetrical way,\nhead to head, like rays of a star. As I stood looking at them, I could\nhave sworn, my good God, that I heard someone coming up the stairs. But\nit was some slight creaking of the breeze in the house, augmented a\nhundredfold to my inflamed and fevered hearing: for, used for years now\nto this silence of Eternity, it is as though I hear all sounds through\nan ear-trumpet. I went down, and after eating, and drinking some\nclary-water, made of brandy, sugar, cinnamon, and rose water, which I\nfound in plenty, I lay down on a sofa in the inner hall, and slept a\nquiet sleep until near midnight.\n\nI went out then, still possessed with the foolish greed to reach London,\nand after getting the engine to rights, went off under a clear black sky\nthronged with worlds and far-sown spawn, some of them, I thought,\nperhaps like this of mine, whelmed and drowned in oceans of silence,\nwith one only inhabitant to see it, and hear its silence. And all the\nlong night I travelled, stopping twice only, once to get the coal from\nan engine which had impeded me, and once to drink some water, which I\ntook care, as always, should be running water. When I felt my head nod,\nand my eyes close about 5 A.M., I threw myself, just outside the arch of\na tunnel upon a grassy bank, pretty thick with stalks and flowers, the\nworkings of early dawn being then in the east: and there, till near\neleven, slept.\n\nOn waking, I noticed that the country now seemed more like Surrey than\nKent: there was that regular swell and sinking of the land; but, in\nfact, though it must have been either, it looked like neither, for\nalready all had an aspect of return to a state of wild nature, and I\ncould see that for a year at the least no hand had tended the soil. Near\nbefore me was a stretch of lucerne of such extraordinary growth, that I\nwas led during that day and the succeeding one to examine the condition\nof vegetation with some minuteness, and nearly everywhere I detected a\ncertain hypertrophie tendency in stamens, calycles, pericarps, and\npistils, in every sort of bulbiferous growth that I looked at, in the\nrushes, above all, the fronds, mosses, lichens, and all cryptogamia, and\nin the trefoils, clover especially, and some creepers. Many\ncrop-fields, it was clear, had been prepared, but not sown; some had\nnot been reaped: and in both cases I was struck with their appearance of\nrankness, as I was also when in Norway, and was all the more surprised\nthat this should be the case at a time when a poison, whose action is\nthe arrest of oxidation, had traversed the earth; I could only conclude\nthat its presence in large volumes in the lower strata of the atmosphere\nhad been more or less temporary, and that the tendency to exuberance\nwhich I observed was due to some principle by which Nature acts with\nfreer energy and larger scope in the absence of man.\n\nTwo yards from the rails I saw, when I got up, a little rill beside a\nrotten piece of fence, barely oozing itself onward under masses of foul\nand stagnant fungoids: and here there was a sudden splash, and life: and\nI caught sight of the hind legs of a diving young frog. I went and lay\non my belly, poring over the clear dulcet little water, and presently\nsaw two tiny bleaks, or ablets, go gliding low among the swaying\nmoss-hair of the bottom-rocks, and thought how gladly would I be one of\nthem, with my home so thatched and shady, and my life drowned in their\nwide-eyed reverie. At any rate, these little creatures are alive, the\nbatrachians also, and, as I found the next day, pupae and chrysales of\none sort or another, for, to my deep emotion, I saw a little white\nbutterfly staggering in the air over the flower-garden of a rustic\nstation named Butley.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was while I was lying there, poring upon that streamlet, that a\nthought came into my head: for I said to myself: 'If now I be here\nalone, alone, alone... alone, alone... one on the earth... and my girth\nhave a spread of 25,000 miles... what will happen to my mind? Into what\nkind of creature shall I writhe and change? I may live two years so!\nWhat will have happened then? I may live five years--ten! What will have\nhappened after the five? the ten? I may live twenty, thirty, forty...'\n\nAlready, already, there are things that peep and sprout within me...!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI wanted food and fresh running water, and walked from the engine half a\nmile through fields of lucerne whose luxuriance quite hid the\nfoot-paths, and reached my shoulder. After turning the brow of a hill, I\ncame to a park, passing through which I saw some dead deer and three\npersons, and emerged upon a terraced lawn, at the end of which stood an\nEarly English house of pale brick with copings, plinths, stringcourses\nof limestone, and spandrels of carved marble; and some distance from the\nporch a long table, or series of tables, in the open air, still spread\nwith cloths that were like shrouds after a month of burial; and the\ntable had old foods on it, and some lamps; and all around it, and all on\nthe lawn, were dead peasants. I seemed to know the house, probably from\nsome print which I may have seen, but I could not make out the\nescutcheon, though I saw from its simplicity that it must be very\nancient. Right across the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade spread still some of the letters in\nevergreens of the motto: 'Many happy returns of the day,' so that\nsomeone must have come of age, or something, for inside all was gala,\nand it was clear that these people had defied a fate which they, of\ncourse, foreknew. I went nearly throughout the whole spacious place of\nthick-carpeted halls, marbles, and famous oils, antlers and arras, and\ngilt saloons, and placid large bed-chambers: and it took me an hour.\nThere were here not less than a hundred and eighty people. In the first\nof a vista of three large reception-rooms lay what could only have been\na number of quadrille parties, for to the _coup d'oeil_ they presented a\ntwo-and-two appearance, made very repulsive by their jewels and\nevening-dress. I had to steel my heart to go through this house, for I\ndid not know if these people were looking at me as soon as my back was\nturned. Once I was on the very point of flying, for I was going up the\ngreat central stairway, and there came a pelt of dead leaves against a\nwindow-pane in a corridor just above on the first floor, which thrilled\nme to the inmost soul. But I thought that if I once fled, they would all\nbe at me from behind, and I should be gibbering mad long, long before I\nreached the outer hall, and so stood my ground, even defiantly\nadvancing. In a small dark bedroom in the north wing on the second\nfloor--that is to say, at the top of the house--I saw a tall young lady\nand a groom, or wood-man, to judge by his clothes, horribly riveted in\nan embrace on a settee, she with a light coronet on her head in\nlow-necked dress, and their lipless teeth still fiercely pressed\ntogether. I collected in a bag a few delicacies from the under-regions\nof this house, Lyons sausages, salami, mortadel, apples, roes, raisins,\nartichokes, biscuits, a few wines, a ham, bottled fruit, pickles,\ncoffee, and so on, with a gold plate, tin-opener, cork-screw, fork, &c.,\nand dragged them all the long way back to the engine before I could eat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy brain was in such a way, that it was several days before the\nperfectly obvious means of finding my way to London, since I wished to\ngo there, at all occurred to me; and the engine went wandering the\nintricate railway-system of the south country, I having twice to water\nher with a coal-bucket from a pool, for the injector was giving no water\nfrom the tank under the coals, and I did not know where to find any near\ntank-sheds. On the fifth evening, instead of into London, I ran into\nGuildford.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat night, from eleven till the next day, there was a great storm over\nEngland: let me note it down. And ten days later, on the 17th of the\nmonth came another; and on the 23rd another; and I should be put to it\nto count the great number since. And they do not resemble English\nstorms, but rather Arctic ones, in a certain very suggestive something\nof personalness, and a carousing malice, and a Tartarus gloom, which I\ncannot quite describe. That night at Guildford, after wandering about,\nand becoming very weary, I threw myself upon a cushioned pew in an old\nNorman church with two east apses, called St. Mary's, using a\nBible-cushion for pillow, and placing some distance away a little tin\nlamp turned low, whose ray served me for _veilleuse_ through the night.\nHappily I had taken care to close up everything, or, I feel sure, the\nroof must have gone. Only one dead, an old lady in a chapel on the north\nside of the chancel, whom I rather mistrusted, was there with me: and\nthere I lay listening: for, after all, I could not sleep a wink, while\noutside vogued the immense tempest. And I communed with myself,\nthinking: 'I, poor man, lost in this conflux of infinitudes and vortex\nof the world, what can become of me, my God? For dark, ah dark, is the\nwaste void into which from solid ground I am now plunged a million\nfathoms deep, the sport of all the whirlwinds: and it were better for me\nto have died with the dead, and never to have seen the wrath and\nturbulence of the Ineffable, nor to have heard the thrilling bleakness\nof the winds of Eternity, when they pine, and long, and whimper, and\nwhen they vociferate and blaspheme, and when they expostulate and\nintrigue and implore, and when they despair and die, which ear of man\nshould never hear. For they mean to eat me up, I know, these Titanic\ndarknesses: and soon like a whiff I shall pass away, and leave the world\nto them.' So till next morning I lay mumping, with shivers and\ncowerings: for the shocks of the storm pervaded the locked church to my\nvery heart; and there were thunders that night, my God, like callings\nand laughs and banterings, exchanged between distant hill-tops in Hell.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n'Well, the next morning I went down the steep High Street, and found a\nyoung nun at the bottom whom I had left the previous evening with a\nnumber of girls in uniform opposite the Guildhall--half-way up the\nstreet. She must have been spun down, arm over arm, for the wind was\nwesterly, and whereas I had left her completely dressed to her wimple\nand beads, she was now nearly stripped, and her little flock scattered.\nAnd branches of trees, and wrecked houses, and reeling clouds of dead\nleaves were everywhere that wild morning.\n\nThis town of Guildford appeared to be the junction of an extraordinary\nnumber of railway-lines, and before again setting out in the afternoon,\nwhen the wind had lulled, having got an A B C guide, and a railway-map,\nI decided upon my line, and upon a new engine, feeling pretty sure now\nof making London, only thirty miles away. I then set out, and about five\no'clock was at Surbiton, near my aim; I kept on, expecting every few\nminutes to see the great city, till darkness fell, and still, at\nconsiderable risk, I went, as I thought, forward: but no London was\nthere. I had, in fact, been on a loop-line, and at Surbiton gone wrong\nagain; for the next evening I found myself at Wokingham, farther away\nthan ever.\n\nI slept on a rug in the passage of an inn called The Rose, for there was\na wild, Russian-looking man, with projecting top-teeth, on a bed in the\nhouse, whose appearance I did not like, and it was late, and I too tired\nto walk further; and the next morning pretty early I set out again, and\nat 10 A.M. was at Reading.\n\nThe notion of navigating the land by precisely the same means as the\nsea, simple and natural as it was, had not at all occurred to me: but at\nthe first accidental sight of a compass in a little shop-window near the\nriver at Reading, my difficulties as to getting to any desired place in\nthe world vanished once and for all: for a good chart or map, the\ncompass, a pair of compasses, and, in the case of longer distances, a\nquadrant, sextant or theodolite, with a piece of paper and pencil, were\nall that were necessary to turn an engine into a land-ship, one choosing\nthe lines that ran nearest the direction of one's course, whenever they\ndid not run precisely.\n\nThus provided, I ran out from Reading about seven in the evening, while\nthere was still some light, having spent there some nine hours. This was\nthe town where I first observed that shocking crush of humanity, which\nI afterwards met in every large town west of London. Here, I should say,\nthe English were quite equal in number to the foreigners: and there were\nenough of both, God knows: for London must have poured many here. There\nwere houses, in every room of which, and on the stairs, the dead\nactually overlay each other, and in the streets before them were points\nwhere only on flesh, or under carriages, was it possible to walk. I went\ninto the great County Gaol, from which, as I had read, the prisoners had\nbeen released two weeks before-hand, and there I found the same pressed\ncondition, cells occupied by ten or twelve, the galleries continuously\nrough-paved with faces, heads, and old-clothes-shops of robes; and in\nthe parade-ground, against one wall, a mass of human stuff, like tough\ngrey clay mixed with rags and trickling black gore, where a crush as of\nhydraulic power must have acted. At a corner between a gate and a wall\nnear the biscuit-factory of this town I saw a boy, whom I believe to\nhave been blind, standing jammed, at his wrist a chain-ring, and, at the\nend of the chain, a dog; from his hap-hazard posture I conjectured that\nhe, and chain, and dog had been lifted from the street, and placed so,\nby the storm of the 7th of the month; and what made it very curious was\nthat his right arm pointed a little outward just over the dog, so that,\nat the moment when I first sighted him, he seemed a drunken fellow\nsetting his dog at me. In fact, all the dead I found much mauled and\nstripped and huddled: and the earth seemed to be making an abortive\neffort to sweep her streets.\n\nWell, some little distance from Reading I saw a big flower-seed farm,\nlooking dead in some plots, and in others quite rank: and here again,\nfluttering quite near the engine, two little winged aurelians in the\nquiet evening air. I went on, passing a great number of crowded trains\non the down-line, two of them in collision, and very broken up, and one\nexploded engine; even the fields and cuttings on either hand of the line\nhad a rather populous look, as if people, when trains and vehicles\nfailed, had set to trudging westward in caravans and streams. When I\ncame to a long tunnel near Slough, I saw round the foot of the arch an\nextraordinary quantity of wooden _d\u00c3\u00a9bris_, and as I went very slowly\nthrough, was alarmed by the continuous bumping of the train, which, I\nknew, was passing over bodies; at the other end were more _d\u00c3\u00a9bris_; and\nI easily guessed that a company of desperate people had made the tunnel\nair-tight at the two arches, and provisioned themselves, with the hope\nto live there till the day of destiny was passed; whereupon their\nbarricades must have been crashed through by some up-train and\nthemselves crushed, or else, other crowds, mad to share their cave of\nrefuge, had stormed the boardings. This latter, as I afterwards found,\nwas a very usual event.\n\nI should very soon have got to London now, but, as my bad luck would\nhave it, I met a long up-train on the metals, with not one creature in\nany part of it. There was nothing to do but to tranship, with all my\nthings, to its engine, which I found in good condition with plenty of\ncoal and water, and to set it going, a hateful labour: I being already\njet-black from hair to toes. However, by half-past ten I found myself\nstopped by another train only a quarter of a mile from Paddington, and\nwalked the rest of the way among trains in which the standing dead still\nstood, propped by their neighbours, and over metals where bodies were as\nordinary and cheap as waves on the sea, or twigs in a forest. I believe\nthat wild crowds had given chase on foot to moving trains, or fore-run\nthem in the frenzied hope of inducing them to stop.\n\nI came to the great shed of glass and girders which is the station, the\nnight being perfectly soundless, moonless, starless, and the hour about\neleven.\n\nI found later that all the electric generating-stations, or all that I\nvisited, were intact; that is to say, must have been shut down before\nthe arrival of the doom; also that the gas-works had almost certainly\nbeen abandoned some time previously: so that this city of dreadful\nnight, in which, at the moment when Silence choked it, not less than\nforty to sixty millions swarmed and droned, must have more resembled\nTartarus and the foul shades of Hell than aught to which my fancy can\nliken it.\n\nFor, coming nearer the platforms, I saw that trains, in order to move at\nall, must have moved through a slough of bodies pushed from behind, and\nforming a packed homogeneous mass on the metals: and I knew that they\n_had_ moved. Nor could _I_ now move, unless I decided to wade: for flesh\nwas everywhere, on the roofs of trains, cramming the interval between\nthem, on the platforms, splashing the pillars like spray, piled on\ntrucks and lorries, a carnal quagmire; and outside, it filled the space\nbetween a great host of vehicles, carpeting all that region of London.\nAnd all here that odour of blossoms, which nowhere yet, save on one vile\nship, had failed, was now wholly overcome by another: and the thought\nwas in my head, my God, that if the soul of man had sent up to Heaven\nthe odour which his body gave to me, then it was not so strange that\nthings were as they were.\n\nI got out from the station, with ears, God knows, that still awaited the\naccustomed noising of this accursed town, habituated as I now was to all\nthe dumb and absent void of Soundlessness; and I was overwhelmed in a\nnew awe, and lost in a wilder woesomeness, when, instead of lights and\nbusiness, I saw the long street which I knew brood darker than Babylons\nlong desolate, and in place of its ancient noising, heard, my God, a\nshocking silence, rising higher than I had ever heard it, and blending\nwith the silence of the inane, eternal stars in heaven.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI could not get into any vehicle for some time, for all thereabouts was\npractically a mere block; but near the Park, which I attained by\nstooping among wheels, and selecting my foul steps, I overhauled a\nDaimler car, found in it two cylinders of petrol, lit the ignition-lamp,\nremoved with averted abhorrence three bodies, mounted, and broke that\npopulous stillness. And through streets nowhere empty of bodies I went\nurging eastward my jolting, and spattered, and humming way.\n\nThat I should have persisted, with so much pains, to come to this\nunbounded catacomb, seems now singular to me: for by that time I could\nnot have been sufficiently daft to expect to find another being like\nmyself on the earth, though I cherished, I remember, the irrational hope\nof yet somewhere finding dog, or cat, or horse, to be with me, and would\nanon think bitterly of Reinhardt, my Arctic dog, which my own hand had\nshot. But, in reality, a morbid curiosity must have been within me all\nthe time to read the real truth of what had happened, so far as it was\nknown, or guessed, and to gloat upon all that drama, and cup of\ntrembling, and pouring out of the vials of the wrath of God, which must\nhave preceded the actual advent of the end of Time. This inquisitiveness\nhad, at every town which I reached, made the search for newspapers\nuppermost in my mind; but, by bad luck, I had found only four, all of\nthem ante-dated to the one which I had read at Dover, though their dates\ngave me some idea of the period when printing must have ceased, viz.\nsoon after the 17th July--about three months subsequent to my arrival at\nthe Pole--for none I found later than this date; and these contained\nnothing scientific, but only orisons and despairings. On arriving,\ntherefore, at London, I made straight for the office of the _Times_,\nonly stopping at a chemist's in Oxford Street for a bottle of antiseptic\nto hold near my nose, though, having once left the neighbourhood of\nPaddington, I had hardly much need of this.\n\nI made my way to the square where the paper was printed, to find that,\neven there, the ground was closely strewn with calpac and pugaree, black\nabayeh and fringed praying-shawl, hob-nail and sandal, figured lungi and\nstriped silk, all very muddled and mauled. Through the dark square to\nthe twice-dark building I passed, and found open the door of an\nadvertisement-office; but on striking a match, saw that it had been\nlighted by electricity, and had therefore to retrace my stumbling steps,\ntill I came to a shop of lamps in a near alley, walking meantime with\ntimid cares that I might hurt no one--for in this enclosed neighbourhood\nI began to feel strange tremors, and kept striking matches, which, so\nstill was the black air, hardly flickered.\n\nWhen I returned to the building with a little lighted lamp, I at once\nsaw a file on a table, and since there were a number of dead there, and\nI wished to be alone, I took the heavy mass of paper between my left arm\nand side, and the lamp in my right hand; passed then behind a counter;\nand then, to the right, up a stair which led me into a very great\nbuilding and complexity of wooden steps and corridors, where I went\npeering, the lamp visibly trembling in my hand, for here also were the\ndead. Finally, I entered a good-sized carpeted room with a baize-covered\ntable in the middle, and large smooth chairs, and on the table many\nmanuscripts impregnated with purple dust, and around were books in\nshelves. This room had been locked upon a single man, a tall man in a\nfrock-coat, with a pointed grey beard, who at the last moment had\ndecided to fly from it, for he lay at the threshold, apparently fallen\ndead the moment he opened the door. Him, by drawing his feet aside, I\nremoved, locked the door upon myself, sat at the table before the dusty\nfile, and, with the little lamp near, began to search.\n\nI searched and read till far into the morning. But God knows, He\nalone....\n\nI had not properly filled the little reservoir with oil, and at about\nthree in the fore-day, it began to burn sullenly lower, letting sparks,\nand turning the glass grey: and in my deepest chilly heart was the\nquestion: 'Suppose the lamp goes out before the daylight....'\n\nI knew the Pole, and cold, I knew them well: but to be frozen by panic,\nmy God! I read, I say, I searched, I would not stop: but I read that\nnight racked by terrors such as have never yet entered into the heart\nof man to conceive. My flesh moved and crawled like a lake which, here\nand there, the breeze ruffles. Sometimes for two, three, four minutes,\nthe profound interest of what I read would fix my mind, and then I would\nperuse an entire column, or two, without consciousness of the meaning of\none single word, my brain all drawn away to the innumerable host of the\nwan dead that camped about me, pierced with horror lest they should\nstart, and stand, and accuse me: for the grave and the worm was the\nworld; and in the air a sickening stirring of cerements and shrouds; and\nthe taste of the pale and insubstantial grey of ghosts seemed to infect\nmy throat, and faint odours of the loathsome tomb my nostrils, and the\ntoll of deep-toned passing-bells my ears; finally the lamp smouldered\nvery low, and my charnel fancy teemed with the screwing-down of coffins,\nlych-gates and sextons, and the grating of ropes that lower down the\ndead, and the first sound of the earth upon the lid of that strait and\ngloomy home of the mortal; that lethal look of cold dead fingers I\nseemed to see before me, the insipidness of dead tongues, the pout of\nthe drowned, and the vapid froths that ridge their lips, till my flesh\nwas moist as with the stale washing-waters of morgues and mortuaries,\nand with such sweats as corpses sweat, and the mawkish tear that lies\non dead men's cheeks; for what is one poor insignificant man in his\nflesh against a whole world of the disembodied, he alone with them, and\nnowhere, nowhere another of his kind, to whom to appeal against them? I\nread, and I searched: but God, God knows ... If a leaf of the paper,\nwhich I slowly, warily, stealingly turned, made but one faintest rustle,\nhow did that _reveille_ boom in echoes through the vacant and haunted\nchambers of my poor aching heart, my God! and there was a cough in my\nthroat which for a cruelly long time I would not cough, till it burst in\nhorrid clamour from my lips, sending crinkles of cold through my inmost\nblood. For with the words which I read were all mixed up visions of\ncrawling hearses, wails, and lugubrious crapes, and piercing shrieks of\nmadness in strange earthy vaults, and all the mournfulness of the black\nVale of Death, and the tragedy of corruption. Twice during the ghostly\nhours of that night the absolute and undeniable certainty that some\npresence--some most gashly silent being--stood at my right elbow, so\nthrilled me, that I leapt to my feet to confront it with clenched fists,\nand hairs that bristled stiff in horror and frenzy. After that second\ntime I must have fainted; for when it was broad day, I found my dropped\nhead over the file of papers, supported on my arms. And I resolved then\nnever again after sunset to remain in any house: for that night was\nenough to kill a horse, my good God; and that this is a haunted planet I\nknow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat I read in the _Times_ was not very definite, for how could it be?\nbut in the main it confirmed inferences which I had myself drawn, and\nfairly satisfied my mind.\n\nThere had been a battle royal in the paper between my old collaborator\nProfessor Stanistreet and Dr. Martin Rogers, and never could I have\nconceived such an indecorous piece of business, men like them calling\none another 'tyro,' 'dreamer,' and in one place 'block-head.'\nStanistreet denied that the perfumed odour of almonds attributed to the\nadvancing cloud could be due to anything but the excited fancy of the\nreporting fugitives, because, said he, it was unknown that either Cn,\nHCn, or K_4FeCn_6 had been given out by volcanoes, and the\ndestructiveness to life of the travelling cloud could only be owing to\nCO and CO_2. To this Rogers, in an article characterised by\nextraordinary heat, replied that he could not understand how even a\n'tyro'(!) in chemical and geological phenomena would venture to rush\ninto print with the statement that HCn had not commonly been given out\nby volcanoes: that it _had_ been, he said, was perfectly certain; though\nwhether it had been or not could not affect the decision of a reasoning\nmind as to whether it was being: for that cyanogen, as a matter of fact,\nwas not rare in nature, though not directly occurring, being one of the\nproducts of the common distillation of pit-coal, and found in roots,\npeaches, almonds, and many tropical flora; also that it had been\nactually pointed out as probable by more than one thinker that some salt\nor salts of Cn, the potassic, or the potassic ferrocyanide, or both,\nmust exist in considerable stores in the earth at volcanic depths. In\nreply to this, Stanistreet in a two-column article used the word\n'dreamer,' and Rogers, when Berlin had been already silenced, finally\nreplied with his amazing 'block-head.' But, in my opinion, by far the\nmost learned and lucid of the scientific dicta was from the rather\nunexpected source of Sloggett, of the Dublin Science and Art Department:\nhe, without fuss, accepted the statements of the fugitive eye-witnesses,\ndown to the assertion that the cloud, as it rolled travelling, seemed\nmixed from its base to the clouds with languid tongues of purple flame,\nrose-coloured at their edges. This, Sloggett explained, was the\ncharacteristic flame of both cyanogen and hydrocyanic acid vapour,\nwhich, being inflammable, may have become locally ignited in the passage\nover cities, and only burned in that limited and languid way on account\nof the ponderous volumes of carbonic anhydride with which they must, of\ncourse, be mixed: the dark empurpled colour was due to the presence of\nlarge quantities of the scoriae of the trappean rocks: basalts,\ngreen-stone, trachytes, and the various porphyries. This article was\nmost remarkable for its clear divination, because written so early--not\nlong, in fact, after the cessation of telegraphic communication with\nAustralia and China; and at a date so early Sloggett stated that the\ncharacter of the devastation not only proved an eruption--another, but\nfar greater Krakatoa--probably in some South Sea region, but indicated\nthat its most active product must be, not CO, but potassic ferrocyanide\n(K_4FeCn_6), which, undergoing distillation with the products of sulphur\nin the heat of eruption, produced hydrocyanic acid (HCn); and this\nvolatile acid, he said, remaining in a vaporous state in all climates\nabove a temperature of 26.5\u00c2\u00b0 C., might involve the entire earth, if the\neruption proved sufficiently powerful, travelling chiefly in a direction\ncontrary to the earth's west-to-east motion, the only regions which\nwould certainly be exempt being the colder regions of the Arctic\ncircles, where the vapour of the acid would assume the liquid state, and\nfall as rain. He did not anticipate that vegetation would be permanently\naffected, unless the eruption were of inconceivable duration and\nactivity, for though the poisonous quality of hydrocyanic acid consisted\nin its sudden and complete arrest of oxidation, vegetation had two\nsources of life--the soil as well as the air; with this exception, all\nlife, down to the lowest evolutionary forms, would disappear (here was\nthe one point in which he was somewhat at fault), until the earth\nreproduced them. For the rest, he fixed the rate of the on-coming cloud\nat from 100 to 105 miles a day; and the date of eruption, either the\n14th, 15th, or 16th of April--which was either one, two, or three days\nafter the arrival of the _Boreal_ party at the Pole; and he concluded by\nsaying that, if the facts were as he had stated them, then he could\nsuggest no hiding-place for the race of man, unless such places as mines\nand tunnels could be made air-tight; nor could even they be of use to\nany considerable number, except in the event of the poisonous state of\nthe air being of very short duration.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had thought of mines before: but in a very languid way, till this\narticle, and other things that I read, as it were struck my brain a slap\nwith the notion. For 'there,' I said, 'if anywhere, shall I find a\nman....'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI went out from that building that morning feeling like a man bowed down\nwith age, for the depths of unutterable horror into which I had had\nglimpses during that one night made me very feeble, and my steps\ntottered, and my brain reeled.\n\nI got out into Farringdon Street, and at the near Circus, where four\nstreets meet, had under my furthest range of vision nothing but four\nfields of bodies, bodies, clad in a rag-shop of every faded colour, or\nhalf-clad, or not clad at all, actually, in many cases, over-lying one\nanother, as I had seen at Reading, but here with a markedly more\nskeleton appearance: for I saw the swollen-looking shoulders, sharp\nhips, hollow abdomens, and stiff bony limbs of people dead from famine,\nthe whole having the grotesque air of some _macabre_ battle-field of\nfallen marionettes. Mixed with these was an extraordinary number of\nvehicles of all sorts, so that I saw that driving among them would be\nimpracticable, whereas the street which I had taken during the night\nwas fairly clear. I thought a minute what I should do: then went by a\nparallel back-street, and came out to a shop in the Strand, where I\nhoped to find all the information which I needed about the excavations\nof the country. The shutters were up, and I did not wish to make any\nnoise among these people, though the morning was bright, it being about\nten o'clock, and it was easy to effect entrance, for I saw a crow-bar in\na big covered furniture-van near. I, therefore, went northward, till I\ncame to the British Museum, the cataloguing-system of which I knew well,\nand passed in. There was no one at the library-door to bid me stop, and\nin the great round reading-room not a soul, except one old man with a\nbag of go\u00c3\u00aetre hung at his neck, and spectacles, he lying up a\nbook-ladder near the shelves, a 'reader' to the last. I got to the\nprinted catalogues, and for an hour was upstairs among the dim sacred\ngalleries of this still place, and at the sight of certain Greek and\nCoptic papyri, charters, seals, had such a dream of this ancient earth,\nmy good God, as even an angel's pen could not half express on paper.\nAfterwards, I went away loaded with a good hundred-weight of\nOrdnance-maps, which I had stuffed into a bag found in the cloak-room,\nwith three topographical books; I then, at an instrument-maker's in\nHolborn, got a sextant and theodolite, and at a grocer's near the river\nput into a sack-bag provisions to last me a week or two; at Blackfriars\nBridge wharf-station I found a little sharp white steamer of a few tons,\nwhich happily was driven by liquid air, so that I had no troublesome\nfire to light: and by noon I was cutting my solitary way up the Thames,\nwhich flowed as before the ancient Britons were born, and saw it, and\nbuilt mud-huts there amid the primaeval forest; and afterwards the\nRomans came, and saw it, and called it Tamesis, or Thamesis.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat night, as I lay asleep on the cabin-cushions of my little boat\nunder the lee of an island at Richmond, I had a clear dream, in which\nsomething, or someone, came to me, and asked me a question: for it said:\n'Why do you go seeking another man?--that you may fall upon him, and\nkiss him? or that you may fall upon him, and murder him?' And I answered\nsullenly in my dream: 'I would not murder him. I do not wish to murder\nanyone.'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat was essential to me was to know, with certainty, whether I was\nreally alone: for some instinct began to whisper me: 'Find that out: be\nsure, be sure: for without the assurance you can never be--yourself.'\n\nI passed into the great Midland Canal, and went northward, leisurely\nadvancing, for I was in no hurry. The weather remained very warm, and\ngreat part of the country was still dressed in autumn leaves. I have\nwritten, I think, of the terrific character of the tempests witnessed in\nEngland since my return: well, the calms were just as intense and novel.\nThis observation was forced upon me: and I could not but be surprised.\nThere seemed no middle course now: if there was a wind, it was a storm:\nif there was not a storm, no leaf stirred, not a roughening zephyr ran\nthe water. I was reminded of maniacs that laugh now, and rave now--but\nnever smile, and never sigh.\n\nOn the fourth afternoon I passed by Leicester, and the next morning left\nmy pleasant boat, carrying maps and compass, and at a small station took\nengine, bound for Yorkshire, where I loitered and idled away two foolish\nmonths, sometimes travelling by steam-engine, sometimes by automobile,\nsometimes by bicycle, and sometimes on foot, till the autumn was quite\nover.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were two houses in London to which especially I had thought to\ngo: one in Harley Street, and one in Hanover Square: but when it came to\nthe point, I would not; and there was a little embowered home in\nYorkshire, where I was born, to which I thought to go: but I would not,\nconfining myself for many days to the eastern half of the county.\n\nOne morning, while passing on foot along the coast-wall from Bridlington\nto Flambro', on turning my eyes from the sea, I was confronted by a\nthing which for a moment or two struck me with the most profound\nastonishment. I had come to a mansion, surrounded by trees, three\nhundred yards from the cliffs: and there, on a path at the bottom of the\ndomain, right before me, was a board marked: 'Trespassers will be\nProsecuted.' At once a mad desire--the first which I had had--to laugh,\nto roar with laughter, to send wild echoes of merriment clapping among\nthe chalk gullies, and abroad on the morning air, seized upon me: but I\nkept it under, though I could not help smiling at this poor man, with\nhis little delusion that a part of the earth was his.\n\nHere the cliffs are, I should say, seventy feet high, broken by frequent\nslips in the upper stratum of clay, and, as I proceeded, climbing\nalways, I encountered some rather formidable gullies in the chalk, down\nand then up which I had to scramble, till I came to a great mound or\nbarrier, stretching right across the great promontory, and backed by a\nnatural ravine, this, no doubt, having been raised as a rampart by some\nof those old invading pirate-peoples, who had their hot life-scuffle,\nand are done now, like the rest. Going on, I came to a bay in the cliff,\nwith a great number of boats lodged on the slopes, some quite high,\nthough the declivities are steep; toward the inner slopes is a lime-kiln\nwhich I explored, but found no one there. When I came out on the other\nside, I saw the village, with an old tower at one end, on a bare stretch\nof land; and thence, after an hour's rest in the kitchen of a little\ninn, went out to the coast-guard station, and the lighthouse.\n\nLooking across the sea eastward, the light-keepers here must have seen\nthat thick cloud of convolving browns and purples, perhaps mixed with\nsmall tongues of fire, slowly walking the water, its roof in the clouds,\nupon them: for this headland is in precisely the same longitude as\nLondon; and, reckoning from the hour when, as recorded in the _Times_,\nthe cloud was seen from Dover over Calais, London and Flambro' must have\nbeen overtaken soon after three o'clock on the Sunday afternoon, the\n25th July. At sight in open daylight of a doom so gloomy--prophesied,\nbut perhaps hoped against to the last, and now come--the light-keepers\nmust have fled howling, supposing them to have so long remained faithful\nto duty: for here was no one, and in the village very few. In this\nlighthouse, which is a circular white tower, eighty feet high, on the\nedge of the cliff, is a book for visitors to sign their names: and I\nwill write something down here in black and white: for the secret is\nbetween God only, and me: After reading a few of the names, I took my\npencil, and I wrote my name there.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe reef before the Head stretches out a quarter of a mile, looking bold\nin the dead low-water that then was, and showing to what extent the sea\nhas pushed back this coast, three wrecks impaled on them, and a big\nsteamer quite near, waiting for the first movements of the already\nstrewn sea to perish. All along the cliff-wall to the bluff crowned by\nScarborough Castle northward, and to the low vanishing coast of\nHolderness southward, appeared those cracks and caves which had brought\nme here, though there seemed no attempts at barricades; however, I got\ndown a rough slope on the south side to a rude wild beach, strewn with\nwave-worn masses of chalk: and never did I feel so paltry and short a\nthing as there, with far-outstretched bays of crags about me, their\nbluffs encrusted at the base with stale old leprosies of shells and\nbarnacles, and crass algae-beards, and, higher up, the white cliff all\nstained and weather-spoiled, the rock in some parts looking quite\nchalky, and elsewhere gleaming hard and dull like dirty marbles, while\nin the huge withdrawals of the coast yawn darksome gullies and caverns.\nHere, in that morning's walk, I saw three little hermit-crabs, a limpet,\nand two ninnycocks in a pool of weeds under a bearded rock. What\nastonished me here, and, indeed, above, and everywhere, in London even,\nand other towns, was the incredible number of birds that strewed the\nground, at some points resembling a real rain, birds of nearly every\nsort, including tropic specimens: so that I had to conclude that they,\ntoo, had fled before the cloud from country to country, till conquered\nby weariness and grief, and then by death.\n\nBy climbing over rocks thick with periwinkles, and splashing through\ngreat sloppy stretches of crinkled sea-weed, which give a raw stench of\nbrine, I entered the first of the gullies: a narrow, long, winding one,\nwith sides polished by the sea-wash, and the floor rising inwards. In\nthe dark interior I struck matches, able still to hear from outside the\nponderous spasmodic rush and jostle of the sea between the crags of the\nreef, but now quite faintly. Here, I knew, I could meet only dead men,\nbut urged by some curiosity, I searched to the end, wading in the middle\nthrough a three-feet depth of sea-weed twine: but there was no one; and\nonly belemnites and fossils in the chalk. I searched several to the\nsouth of the headland, and then went northward past it toward another\nopening and place of perched boats, called in the map North Landing:\nwhere, even now, a distinct smell of fish, left by the old crabbers and\nherring-fishers, was perceptible. A number of coves and bays opened as I\nproceeded; a faded green turf comes down in curves at some parts on the\ncliff-brows, like wings of a young soldier's hair, parted in the middle,\nand plastered on his brow; isolated chalk-masses are numerous, obelisks,\ntop-heavy columns, bastions; at one point no less than eight headlands\nstretched to the end of the world before me, each pierced by its arch,\nNorman or Gothic, in whole or in half; and here again caves, in one of\nwhich I found a carpet-bag stuffed with a wet pulp like bread, and,\nstuck to the rock, a Turkish tarboosh; also, under a limestone quarry,\nfive dead asses: but no man. The east coast had evidently been shunned.\nFinally, in the afternoon I reached Filey, very tired, and there slept.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI went onward by train-engine all along the coast to a region of\niron-ore, alum, and jet-excavations round Whitby and Middlesborough. By\nby-ways near the small place of Goldsborough I got down to the shore at\nKettleness, and reached the middle of a bay in which is a cave called\nthe Hob-Hole, with excavations all around, none of great depth, made by\njet-diggers and quarrymen. In the cave lay a small herd of cattle,\nthough for what purpose put there I cannot guess; and in the\njet-excavations I found nothing. A little further south is the chief\nalum-region, as at Sandsend, but as soon as I saw a works, and the great\ngap in the ground like a crater, where the lias is quarried, containing\nonly heaps of alum-shale, brushwood-stacks, and piles of cement-nodules\nextracted from the lias, I concluded that here could have been found no\nhiding; nor did I purposely visit the others, though I saw two later.\nFrom round Whitby, and those rough moors, I went on to Darlington, not\nfar now from my home: but I would not continue that way, and after two\ndays' indecisive lounging, started for Richmond and the lead mines\nabout Arkengarth Dale, near Reeth. Here begins a region of mountain,\nvarious with glens, fells, screes, scars, swards, becks, passes,\nvillages, river-heads, and dales. Some of the faces which I saw in it\nalmost seemed to speak to me in a broad dialect which I knew. But they\nwere not numerous in proportion: for all this country-side must have had\nits population multiplied by at least some hundreds; and the villages\nhad rather the air of Danube, Levant, or Spanish villages. In one, named\nMarrick, I saw that the street had become the scene either of a great\nbattle or a great massacre; and soon I was everywhere coming upon men\nand women, English and foreign, dead from violence: cracked heads,\nwounds, unhung jaws, broken limbs, and so on. Instead of going direct to\nthe mines from Reeth, that waywardness which now rules my mind, as\nsqualls an abandoned boat, took me somewhat further south-west to the\nvillage of Thwaite, which I actually could not enter, so occupied with\ndead was every spot on which the eye rested a hundred yards about it.\nNot far from here I turned up, on foot now, a very steep, stony road to\nthe right, which leads over the Buttertubs Pass into Wensleydale, the\nday being very warm and bright, with large clouds that looked like\nlakes of molten silver giving off grey fumes in their centre, casting\nmoody shadows over the swardy dale, which below Thwaite expands, showing\nMuker two miles off, the largest village of Upper Swaledale. Soon,\nclimbing, I could look down upon miles of Swaledale and the hills\nbeyond, a rustic panorama of glens and grass, river and cloudshadow, and\nthere was something of lightness in my step that fair day, for I had\nleft all my maps and things, except one, at Reeth, to which I meant to\nreturn, and the earth, which is very good, was--mine. The ascent was\nrough, and also long: but if I paused and looked behind--I saw, I saw.\nMan's notion of a Heaven, a Paradise, reserved for the spirits of the\ngood, clearly arose from impressions which the earth made upon his mind:\nfor no Paradise can be fairer than this; just as his notion of a Hell\narose from the squalid mess into which his own foolish habits of thought\nand action turned this Paradise. At least, so it struck me then: and,\nthinking it, there was a hiss in my breath, as I went up into what more\nand more acquired the character of a mountain pass, with points of\nalmost Alpine savagery: for after I had skirted the edge of a deep glen\non the left, the slopes changed in character, heather was on the\nmountain-sides, a fretting beck sent up its noise, then screes, and\nscars, and a considerable waterfall, and a landscape of crags; and\nlastly a broad and rather desolate summit, palpably nearer the clouds.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo days later I was at the mines: and here I first saw that wide-spread\nscene of horror with which I have since become familiar. The story of\nsix out of ten of them all is the same, and short: selfish 'owners,' an\nousted world, an easy bombardment, and the destruction of all concerned,\nbefore the arrival of the cloud in many cases. About some of the Durham\npit-mouths I have been given the impression that the human race lay\ncollected there; and that the notion of hiding himself in a mine must\nhave occurred to every man alive, and sent him thither.\n\nIn these lead mines, as in most vein-mining, there are more shafts than\nin collieries, and hardly any attempt at artificial ventilation, except\nat rises, winzes and cul-de-sacs. I found accordingly that, though their\ndepth does not exceed three hundred feet, suffocation must often have\nanticipated the other dreaded death. In nearly every shaft, both up-take\nand down-take, was a ladder, either of the mine, or of the fugitives,\nand I was able to descend without difficulty, having dressed myself in a\nhouse at the village in a check flannel shirt, a pair of two-buttoned\ntrousers with circles of leather at the knees, thick boots, and a\nminer's hat, having a leather socket attached to it, into which fitted a\nstraight handle from a cylindrical candlestick; with this light, and\nalso a Davy-lamp, which I carried about with me for a good many months,\nI lived for the most part in the deeps of the earth, searching for the\ntreasure of a life, to find everywhere, in English duckies and guggs,\nPomeranian women in gaudy stiff cloaks, the Walachian, the Mameluk, the\nKhirgiz, the Bonze, the Imaum, and almost every type of man.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne most brilliant Autumn day I walked by the village market-cross at\nBarnard, come at last, but with a tenderness in my heart, and a\nreluctance, to where I was born; for I said I would go and see my sister\nAda, and--the other old one. I leaned and loitered a long time on the\nbridge, gazing up to the craggy height, which is heavy with waving wood,\nand crowned by the Castle-tower, the Tees sweeping round the\nmountain-base, smooth here and sunlit, but a mile down, where I wished\nto go, but would not, brawling bedraggled and lacerated, like a sweet\nstrumpet, all shallow among rocks under reaches of shadow--the shadow of\nRokeby Woods. I climbed very leisurely up the hill-side, having in my\nhand a bag with a meal, and up the stair in the wall to the top I went,\nwhere there is no parapet, but a massiveness of wall that precludes\ndanger; and here in my miner's attire I sat three hours, brooding\nsleepily upon the scene of lush umbrageous old wood that marks the long\nway the river takes, from Marwood Chase up above, and where the rapid\nBalder bickers in, down to bowery Rokeby, touched now with autumn; the\nthickness of trees lessening away toward the uplands, where there are\nfar etherealized stretches of fields within hedgerows, and in the sunny\nmirage of the farthest azure remoteness hints of lonesome moorland. It\nwas not till near three that I went down along the river, then, near\nRokeby, traversing the old meadow, and ascending the old hill: and\nthere, as of old, was the little black square with yellow letters on the\ngate-wall:\n\n  HUNT HILL HOUSE.\n\nNo part, no house, I believe, of this country-side was empty of strange\ncorpses: and they were in Hunt Hill, too. I saw three in the weedy plot\nto the right of the garden-path, where once the hawthorn and lilac tree\nhad grown from well-rollered grass, and in the little bush-wilderness to\nthe left, which was always a wilderness, one more: and in the\nbreakfast-room, to the right of the hall, three; and in the new wooden\nclinker-built attachment opening upon the breakfast-room, two, half\nunder the billiard-table; and in her room overlooking the porch on the\nfirst floor, the long thin form of my mother on her bed, with crushed-in\nleft temple, and at the foot of the bed, face-downward on the floor,\nblack-haired Ada in a night-dress.\n\nOf all the men and women who died, they two alone had burying. For I\ndigged a hole with the stable-spade under the front lilac; and I wound\nthem in the sheets, foot and form and head; and, not without throes and\nqualms, I bore and buried them there.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome time passed after this before the long, multitudinous, and\nperplexing task of visiting the mine-regions again claimed me. I found\nmyself at a place called Ingleborough, which is a big table-mountain,\nwith a top of fifteen to twenty acres, from which the sea is visible\nacross Lancashire to the west; and in the sides of this strange hill are\na number of caves which I searched during three days, sleeping in a\ngarden-shed at a very rural and flower-embowered village, for every room\nin it was thronged, a place marked Clapham in the chart, in Clapdale,\nwhich latter is a dale penetrating the slopes of the mountain: and there\nI found by far the greatest of the caves which I saw, having ascended a\npath from the village to a hollow between two grass slopes, where there\nis a beck, and so entering an arch to the left, screened by trees, into\nthe limestone cliff. The passage narrows pretty rapidly inwards, and I\nhad not proceeded two yards before I saw the clear traces of a great\nbattle here. All this region had, in fact, been invaded, for the cave\nmust have been famous, though I did not remember it myself, and for some\nmiles round the dead were pretty frequent, making the immediate approach\nto the cave a matter for care, if the foot was to be saved from\npollution. It is clear that there had been an iron gate across the\nentrance, that within this a wall had been built across, shutting in I\ndo not know how many, perhaps one or two, perhaps hundreds: and both\ngate and wall had been stormed and broken down, for there still were the\nsledges and rocks which, without doubt, had done it. I had a lamp, and\nat my forehead the lighted candle, and I went on quickly, seeing it\nuseless now to choose my steps where there was no choice, through a\npassage incrusted, roof and sides, with a scabrous petrified lichen, the\nroof low for some ninety yards, covered with down-looking cones, like\nan inverted forest of children's toy-trees. I then came to a round hole,\napparently artificial, opening through a curtain of stalagmitic\nformation into a great cavern beyond, which was quite animated and\nfestal with flashes, sparkles, and diamond-lustres, hung in their\nmyriads upon a movement of the eye, these being produced by large\nnumbers of snowy wet stalagmites, very large and high, down the centre\nof which ran a continuous long lane of clothes and hats and faces; with\nhasty reluctant feet I somehow passed over them, the cave all the time\nwidening, thousands of stalactites appearing on the roof of every size,\nfrom virgin's breast to giant's club, and now everywhere the wet drip,\ndrip, as it were a populous busy bazaar of perspiring brows and hurrying\nfeet, in which the only business is to drip. Where stalactite meets\nstalagmite there are pillars: where stalactite meets stalactite in\nfissures long or short there are elegances, flimsy draperies, delicate\nfantasies; there were also pools of water in which hung heads and feet,\nand there were vacant spots at outlying spaces, where the arched roof,\nwhich continually heightened itself, was reflected in the chill gleam of\nthe floor. Suddenly, the roof came down, the floor went up, and they\nseemed to meet before me; but looking, I found a low opening, through\nwhich, drawing myself on the belly over slime for some yards in\nrepulsive proximity to dead personalities, I came out upon a floor of\nsand and pebbles under a long dry tunnel, arched and narrow, grim and\ndull, without stalactites, suggestive of monks, and catacomb-vaults, and\nthe route to the grave; and here the dead were much fewer, proving\neither that the general mob had not had time to penetrate so far inward,\nor else that those within, if they were numerous, had gone out to\ndefend, or to harken to, the storm of their citadel. This passage led me\ninto an open space, the grandest of all, loftily vaulted, full of genie\nriches and buried treasures of light, the million-fold _ensemble_ of\nlustres dancing schottishe with the eye, as it moved or was still: this\nplace, I should guess, being quite half a mile from the entrance. My\nprying lantern showed me here only nineteen dead, men of various\nnations, and at the far end two holes in the floor, large enough to\nadmit the body, through which from below came up a sound of falling\nwater. Both of these holes, I could see, had been filled with cement\nconcrete--wisely, I fancy, for a current of air from somewhere seemed to\nbe now passing through them: and this would have resulted in the death\nof the hiders. Both, however, of the fillings had been broken through,\none partially, the other wholly, by the ignorant, I presume, who\nthought to hide in a secret place yet beyond, where they may have\nbelieved, on seeing the artificial work, that others were. I had my ear\na long time at one of these openings, listening to that mysterious chant\ndown below in a darkness most murky and dismal; and afterwards, spurred\nby the stubborn will which I had to be thorough, I went back, took a\nnumber of outer robes from the bodies, tied them well together, then one\nend round the nearest pillar, and having put my mouth to the hole,\ncalling: _'Anyone? Anyone?'_ let myself down by the rope of garments,\nthe candle at my head: I had not, however, descended far into those\nmournful shades, when my right foot plunged into water: and instantly\nthe feeling of terror pierced me that all the evil things in the\nuniverse were at my leg to drag me down to Hell: and I was up quicker\nthan I went down: nor did my flight cease till, with a sigh of\ndeliverance, I found myself in open air.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter this, seeing that the autumn warmth was passing away, I set myself\nwith more system to my task, and within the next six months worked with\nsteadfast will, and strenuous assiduity, seeking, not indeed for a man\nin a mine, but for some evidence of the possibility that a man might be\nalive, visiting in that time Northumberland and Durham, Fife and\nKinross, South Wales and Monmouthshire, Cornwall and the Midlands, the\nlead mines of Derbyshire, of Allandale and other parts of\nNorthumberland, of Alston Moor and other parts of Cumberland, of\nArkendale and other parts of Yorkshire, of the western part of Durham,\nof Salop, of Cornwall, of the Mendip Hills of Somersetshire, of Flint,\nCardigan, and Montgomery, of Lanark and Argyll, of the Isle of Man, of\nWaterford and Down; I have gone down the 360-ft. Grand Pipe iron ladder\nof the abandoned graphite-mine at Barrowdale in Cumberland, half-way up\na mountain 2,000 feet high; and visited where cobalt and manganese ore\nis mined in pockets at the Foel Hiraeddog mine near Rhyl in Flintshire,\nand the lead and copper Newton Stewart workings in Galloway; the Bristol\ncoal-fields, and mines of South Staffordshire, where, as in Somerset,\nGloucester, and Shropshire, the veins are thin, and the mining-system is\nthe 'long-wall,' whereas in the North, and Wales, the system is the\n'pillar-and stall'; I have visited the open workings for iron ores of\nNorthamptonshire, and the underground stone-quarries, and the\nunderground slate-quarries, with their alternate pillars and chambers,\nin the Festiniog district of North Wales; also the rock-salt workings;\nthe tin, copper and cobalt workings of Cornwall; and where the minerals\nwere brought to the surface on the backs of men, and where they were\nbrought by adit-levels provided with rail-roads, and where, as in old\nCornish mines, there are two ladders in the shaft, moved up and down\nalternately, see-saw, and by skipping from one to the other at right\nmoments you ascended or descended, and where the drawing-up is by a gin\nor horse-whinn, with vertical drum; the Tisbury and Chilmark quarries in\nWiltshire, the Spinkwell and Cliffwood quarries in Yorkshire; and every\ntunnel, and every recorded hole: for something urged within me, saying:\n'You must be sure first, or you can never be--yourself.'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the Farnbrook Coal-field, in the Red Colt Pit, my inexperience nearly\nended my life: for though I had a minute theoretical knowledge of all\nBritish workings, I was, in my practical relation to them, like a man\nwho has learnt seamanship on shore. At this place the dead were\naccumulated, I think beyond precedent, the dark plain around for at\nleast three miles being as strewn as a reaped field with stacks, and,\nnear the bank, much more strewn than stack-fields, filling the only\nhouse within sight of the pit-mouth--the small place provided for the\ncompany's officials--and even lying over the great mountain-heap of\nwark, composed of the shale and _d\u00c3\u00a9bris_ of the working. Here I arrived\non the morning of the 15th December, to find that, unlike the others,\nthere was here no rope-ladder or other contrivance fixed by the\nfugitives in the ventilating-shaft, which, usually, is not very deep,\nbeing also the pumping-shaft, containing a plug-rod at one end of the\nbeam-engine which works the pumps; but looking down the shaft, I\ndiscerned a vague mass of clothes, and afterwards a thing that could\nonly be a rope-ladder, which a batch of the fugitives, by hanging to it\ntheir united weight, must have dragged down upon themselves, to prevent\nthe descent of yet others. My only way of going down, therefore, was by\nthe pit-mouth, and as this was an important place, after some hesitation\nI decided, very rashly. First I provided for my coming up again by\ngetting a great coil of half-inch rope, which I found in the bailiff's\noffice, probably 130 fathoms long, rope at most mines being so\nplentiful, that it almost seemed as if each fugitive had provided\nhimself in that way. This length of rope I threw over the beam of the\nbeam-engine in the bite where it sustains the rod, and paid one end\ndown the shaft, till both were at the bottom: in this way I could come\nup, by tying one rope-end to the rope-ladder, hoisting it, fastening the\nother end below, and climbing the ladder; and I then set to work to\nlight the pit-mouth engine-fire to effect my descent. This done, I\nstarted the engine, and brought up the cage from the bottom, the 300\nyards of wire-rope winding with a quaint deliberateness round the drum,\nreminding me of a camel's nonchalant leisurely obedience. When I saw the\nfour meeting chains of the cage-roof emerge, the pointed roof, and\ntwo-sided frame, I stopped the ascent, and next attached to the\nknock-off gear a long piece of twine which I had provided; carried the\nother end to the cage, in which I had five companions; lit my\nhat-candle, which was my test for choke-damp, and the Davy; and without\nthe least reflection, pulled the string. That hole was 900 feet deep.\nFirst the cage gave a little up-leap, and then began to descend--quite\nnormally, I thought, though the candle at once went out--nor had I the\nleast fear; a strong current of air, indeed, blew up the shaft: but that\nhappens in shafts. _This_ current, however, soon became too vehemently\nboisterous for anything: I saw the lamp-light struggle, the dead cheeks\nquiver, I heard the cage-shoes go singing down the wire-rope guides,\nand quicker we went, and quicker, that facile descent of Avernus,\nslipping lightly, then raging, with sparks at the shoes and guides, and\na hurricane in my ears and eyes and mouth. When we bumped upon the\n'dogs' at the bottom, I was tossed a foot upwards with the stern-faced\nothers, and then lay among them in the eight-foot space without\nconsciousness.\n\nIt was only when I sat, an hour later, disgustedly reflecting on this\nincident, that I remembered that there was always some 'hand-working' of\nthe engine during the cage-descents, an engineman reversing the action\nby a handle at every stroke of the piston, to prevent bumping. However,\nthe only permanent injury was to the lamp: and I found many others\ninside.\n\nI got out into the coal-hole, a large black hall 70 feet square by 15\nhigh, the floor paved with iron sheets; there were some little holes\nround the wall, dug for some purpose which I never could discover, some\nwaggons full of coal and shale standing about, and all among the\nwaggons, and on them, and under them, bodies, clothes. I got a new lamp,\npouring in my own oil, and went down a long steep ducky-road, very\nrough, with numerous rollers, over which ran a rope to the pit-mouth\nfor drawing up the waggons; and in the sides here, at regular intervals,\nman-holes, within which to rescue one's self from down-tearing waggons;\nand within these man-holes, here and there, a dead, and in others every\nsort of food, and at one place on the right a high dead heap, and the\nair here hot at 64 or 65 degrees, and getting hotter with the descent.\n\nThe ducky led me down into a standing--a space with a turn-table--of\nunusual size, which I made my base of operations for exploring. Here was\na very considerable number of punt-shaped putts on carriages, and also\nwaggons, such as took the new-mined coal from putt to pit-mouth; and\nraying out from this open standing, several avenues, some ascending as\nguggs, some descending as dipples, and the dead here all arranged in\ngroups, the heads of this group pointing up this gugg, of that group\ntoward that twin-way, of that other down that dipple, and the central\nspace, where weighing was done, almost empty: and the darksome silence\nof this deep place, with all these multitudes, I found extremely\ngravitating and hypnotic, drawing me, too, into their great Passion of\nSilence in which they lay, all, all, so fixed and veteran; and at one\ntime I fell a-staring, nearer perhaps to death and the empty Gulf than\nI knew; but I said I would be strong, and not sink into their habit of\nstillness, but let them keep to their own way, and follow their own\nfashion, and I would keep to my own way, and follow my own fashion, nor\nyield to them, though I was but one against many; and I roused myself\nwith a shudder; and setting to work, caught hold of the drum-chain of a\nlong gugg, and planting my feet in the chogg-holes in which rested the\nwheels of the putt-carriages that used to come roaring down the gugg, I\ngot up, stooping under a roof only three feet high, till I came, near\nthe end of the ascent, upon the scene of another battle: for in this\ngugg about fifteen of the mine-hands had clubbed to wall themselves in,\nand had done it, and I saw them lie there all by themselves through the\nbroken cement, with their bare feet, trousers, naked bodies all black,\nvisage all fierce and wild, the grime still streaked with sweat-furrows,\nthe candle in their rimless hats, and, outside, their own 'getting'\nmattocks and boring-irons to besiege them. From the bottom of this gugg\nI went along a very undulating twin-way, into which, every thirty yards\nor so, opened one of those steep putt-ways which they called topples,\nthe twin-ways having plates of about 2-1\/2 ft. gauge for the putts from\nthe headings, or workings, above to come down upon, full of coal and\nshale: and all about here, in twin-way and topples, were ends and\ncorners, and not one had been left without its walling-in, and only one\nwas then intact, some, I fancied, having been broken open by their own\nbuilders at the spur of suffocation, or hunger; and the one intact I\nbroke into with a mattock--it was only a thin cake of plaster, but\nair-tight--and in a space not seven feet long behind it I found the very\nill-smelling corpse of a carting-boy, with guss and tugger at his feet,\nand the pad which protected his head in pushing the putts, and a great\nheap of loaves, sardines, and bottled beer against the walls, and five\nor six mice that suddenly pitched screaming through the opening which I\nmade, greatly startling me, there being of dead mice an extraordinary\nnumber in all this mine-region. I went back to the standing, and at one\npoint in the ground, where there was a windlass and chain, lowered\nmyself down a 'cut'--a small pit sunk perpendicularly to a lower\ncoal-stratum, and here, almost thinking I could hear the perpetual\nrat-tat of notice once exchanged between the putt-boys below and the\nwindlass-boys above, I proceeded down a dipple to another place like a\nstanding, for in this mine there were six, or perhaps seven, veins: and\nthere immediately I came upon the acme of the horrible drama of this\nTartarus, for all here was not merely crowded, but, at some points, a\npacked congestion of flesh, giving out a strong smell of the peach,\ncuriously mixed with the stale coal-odour of the pit, for here\nventilation must have been very limited; and a large number of these\nmasses had been shot down by only three hands, as I found: for through\nthree hermetical holes in a plaster-wall, built across a large gugg,\nprojected a little the muzzles of three rifles, which must have glutted\nthemselves with slaughter; and when, after a horror of disgust, having\nswum as it were through a dead sea, I got to the wall, I peeped from a\nsmall clear space before it through a hole, and made out a man, two\nyouths in their teens, two women, three girls, and piles of cartridges\nand provisions; the hole had no doubt been broken from within at the\nspur of suffocation, when the poison must have entered; and I\nconjectured that here must be the mine-owner, director, manager, or\nsomething of that sort, with his family. In another dipple-region, when\nI had re-ascended to a higher level, I nearly fainted before I could\nretire from the commencement of a region of after-damp, where there had\nbeen an explosion, the bodies lying all hairless, devastated, and\ngrotesque. But I did not desist from searching every other quarter, no\nmomentary work, for not till near six did I go up by the pumping-shaft\nrope-ladder.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne day, standing in that wild region of bare rock and sea, called\nCornwall Point, whence one can see the crags and postillion wild rocks\nwhere Land's End dashes out into the sea, and all the wild blue sea\nbetween, and not a house in sight, save the chimney of some little\nmill-like place peeping between the rocks inland--on that day I finished\nwhat I may call my official search.\n\nIn going away from that place, walking northward, I came upon a lonely\nhouse by the sea, a very beautiful house, made, it was clear, by an\nartist, of the bungalow type, with an exquisitely sea-side expression. I\nwent to it, and found its special feature a spacious loggia or verandah,\nsheltered by the overhanging upper story. Up to the first floor, the\nexterior is of stone in rough-hewn blocks with a distinct batter, while\nextra protection from weather is afforded by green slating above. The\nroofs, of low pitch, are also covered with green slates, and a feeling\nof strength and repose is heightened by the very long horizontal lines.\nAt one end of the loggia is a hexagonal turret, opening upon the loggia,\ncontaining a study or nook. In front, the garden slopes down to the\nsea, surrounded by an architectural sea-wall; and in this place I lived\nthree weeks. It was the house of the poet Machen, whose name, when I saw\nit, I remembered very well, and he had married a very beautiful young\ngirl of eighteen, obviously Spanish, who lay on the bed in the large\nbright bedroom to the right of the loggia, on her left exposed breast\nbeing a baby with an india-rubber comforter in its mouth, both mother\nand child wonderfully preserved, she still quite lovely, white brow\nunder low curves of black hair. The poet, strange to say, had not died\nwith them, but sat in the sitting-room behind the bedroom in a long\nloose silky-grey jacket, at his desk--actually writing a poem! writing,\nI could see, furiously fast, the place all littered with the written\nleaves--at three o'clock in the morning, when, as I knew, the cloud\novertook this end of Cornwall, and stopped him, and put his head to rest\non the desk; and the poor little wife must have got sleepy, waiting for\nit to come, perhaps sleepless for many long nights before, and gone to\nbed, he perhaps promising to follow in a minute to die with her, but\nbent upon finishing that poem, and writing feverishly on, running a race\nwith the cloud, thinking, no doubt, 'just two couplets more,' till the\nthing came, and put his head to rest on the desk, poor carle: and I do\nnot know that I ever encountered aught so complimentary to my race as\nthis dead poet Machen, and his race with the cloud: for it is clear now\nthat the better kind of those poet men did not write to please the vague\ninferior tribes who might read them, but to deliver themselves of the\ndivine warmth that thronged in their bosom; and if all the readers were\ndead, still they would have written; and for God to read they wrote. At\nany rate, I was so pleased with these poor people, that I stayed with\nthem three weeks, sleeping under blankets on a couch in the\ndrawing-room, a place full of lovely pictures and faded flowers, like\nall the house: for I would not touch the young mother to remove her. And\nfinding on Machen's desk a big note-book with soft covers, dappled red\nand yellow, not yet written in, I took it, and a pencil, and in the\nlittle turret-nook wrote day after day for hours this account of what\nhas happened, nearly as far as it has now gone. And I think that I may\ncontinue to write it, for I find in it a strange consolation, and\ncompanionship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the Severn Valley, somewhere in the plain between Gloucester and\nCheltenham, in a rather lonely spot, I at that time travelling on a\ntricycle-motor, I spied a curious erection, and went to it. I found it\nof considerable size, perhaps fifty feet square, and thirty high, made\nof pressed bricks, the perfectly flat roof, too, of brick, and not one\nwindow, and only one door: this door, which I found open, was rimmed all\nround its slanting rims with india-rubber, and when closed must have\nbeen perfectly air-tight. Just inside I came upon fifteen English people\nof the dressed class, except two, who were evidently bricklayers: six\nladies, and nine men: and at the further end, two more, men, who had\ntheir throats cut; along one wall, from end to end were provisions; and\nI saw a chest full of mixed potassic chlorate and black oxide of\nmanganese, with an apparatus for heating it, and producing oxygen--a\nfoolish thing, for additional oxygen could not alter the quantity of\nbreathed carbonic anhydride, which is a direct narcotic poison. Whether\nthe two with cut throats had sacrificed themselves for the others when\nbreathing difficulties commenced, or been killed by the others, was not\nclear. When they could bear it no longer, they must have finally opened\nthe door, hoping that by then, after the passage of many days perhaps,\nthe outer air would be harmless, and so met their death. I believe that\nthis erection must have been run up by their own hands under the\ndirection of the two bricklayers, for they could not, I suppose, have\ngot workmen, except on the condition of the workmen's admission: on\nwhich condition they would naturally employ as few as possible.\n\nIn general, I remarked that the rich must have been more urgent and\nearnest in seeking escape than the others: for the poor realised only\nthe near and visible, lived in to-day, and cherished the always-false\nnotion that to-morrow would be just like to-day. In an out-patients'\nwaiting-room, for instance, in the Gloucester infirmary, I chanced to\nsee an astonishing thing: five bodies of poor old women in shawls, come\nto have their ailments seen-to on the day of doom; and these, I\nconcluded, had been unable to realise that anything would really happen\nto the daily old earth which they knew, and had walked with assurance\non: for if everybody was to die, they must have thought, who would\npreach in the Cathedral on Sunday evenings?--so they could not have\nbelieved. In an adjoining room sat an old doctor at a table, the\nstethoscope-tips still clinging in his ears: a woman with bared chest\nbefore him; and I thought to myself: 'Well, this old man, too, died\ndoing his work....'\n\nIn this same infirmary there was one surgical ward--for in a listless\nmood I went over it--where the patients had died, not of the poison, nor\nof suffocation, but of hunger: for the doctors, or someone, had made the\nlong room air-tight, double-boarding the windows, felting the doors, and\nthen locking them outside; they themselves may have perished before\ntheir precautions for the imprisoned patients were complete: for I found\na heap of maimed shapes, mere skeletons, crowded round the door within.\nI knew very well that they had not died of the cloud-poison, for the\npestilence of the ward was unmixed with that odour of peach which did\nnot fail to have more or less embalming effects upon the bodies which it\nsaturated. I rushed stifling from that place; and thinking it a pity,\nand a danger, that such a horror should be, I at once set to work to\ngather combustibles to burn the building to the ground.\n\nIt was while I sat in an arm-chair in the street the next afternoon,\nsmoking, and watching the flames of this structure, that something was\nsuddenly born in me, something from the lowest Hell: and I smiled a\nsmile that never yet man smiled. And I said: 'I will burn, I will burn:\nI will return to London....'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile I was on this Eastward journey, stopping for the night at the\ntown of Swindon, I had a dream: for I dreamed that a little brown bald\nold man, with a bent back, whose beard ran in one thin streamlet of\nsilver from his chin to trail along the ground, said to me: 'You think\nthat you are alone on the earth, its sole Despot: well, have your fling:\nbut as sure as God lives, as God lives, as God lives'--he repeated it\nsix times--'sooner or later, later or sooner, you will meet another....'\n\nAnd I started from that frightful sleep with the brow of a corpse, wet\nwith sweat....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI returned to London on the 29th of March, arriving within a hundred\nyards of the Northern Station one windy dark evening about eight, where\nI alighted, and walked to Euston Road, then eastward along it, till I\ncame to a shop which I knew to be a jeweller's, though it was too dark\nto see any painted words. The door, to my annoyance, was locked, like\nnearly all the shop-doors in London: I therefore went looking near the\nground, and into a cart, for something heavy, very soon saw a labourer's\nponderous boots, cut one from the shrivelled foot, and set to beat at\nthe glass till it came raining; then knocked away the bottom splinters,\nand entered.\n\nNo horrors now at that clatter of broken glass; no sick qualms; my\npulse steady; my head high; my step royal; my eye cold and calm.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEight months previously, I had left London a poor burdened, cowering\nwight. I could scream with laughter now at that folly! But it did not\nlast long. I returned to it--the Sultan.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo private palace being near, I was going to that great hotel in\nBloomsbury: but though I knew that numbers of candle-sticks would be\nthere, I was not sure that I should find sufficient: for I had acquired\nthe habit within the past few months of sleeping with at least sixty\nlighted about me, and their form, pattern, style, age, and material was\nof no small importance I selected ten from the broken shop, eight gold\nand silver, and two of old ecclesiastical brass, and having made a\nbundle, went out, found a bicycle at the Metropolitan Station, pumped\nit, tied my bundle to the handle-bar, and set off riding. But since I\nwas too lazy to walk, I should certainly have procured some other means\nof travelling, for I had not gone ten jolted and creaking yards, when\nsomething went snap--it was a front fork--and I found myself half on\nthe ground, and half across the bare knees of a Highland soldier. I flew\nwith a shower of kicks upon the foolish thing: but that booted nothing;\nand this was my last attempt in that way in London, the streets being in\nan unsuitable condition.\n\nAll that dismal night it blew great guns: and during nearly three weeks,\ntill London was no more, there was a storm, with hardly a lull, that\nseemed to behowl her destruction.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI slept in a room on the second-floor of a Bloomsbury hotel that night;\nand waking the next day at ten, ate with accursed shiverings in the cold\nbanqueting-room; went out then, and under drear low skies walked a long\nway to the West district, accompanied all the time by a sound of\nflapping flags--fluttering robes and rags--and grotesquely grim glimpses\nof decay. It was pretty cold, and though I was warmly clad, the base\n_bizarrerie_ of the European clothes which I wore had become a perpetual\noffence and mockery in my eyes: at the first moment, therefore, I set\nout whither I knew that I should find such clothes as a man might wear:\nto the Turkish Embassy in Bryanston Square.\n\nI found it open, and all the house, like most other houses, almost\ncarpeted with dead forms. I had been acquainted with Redouza Pasha, and\ncast an eye about for him amid that invasion of veiled hanums,\nfierce-looking Caucasians in skins of beasts, a Sheik-ul-Islam in green\ncloak, a khalifa, three emirs in cashmere turbans, two tziganes, their\ngaudy brown mortality more glaringly abominable than even the Western's.\nI could recognise no Redouza here: but the stair was fairly clear, and I\nsoon came to one of those boudoirs which sweetly recall the deep-buried\ninner seclusion and dim sanctity of the Eastern home: a door encrusted\nwith mother-of-pearl, sculptured ceiling, candles clustered in tulips\nand roses of opal, a brazen brasero, and, all in disarray, the silken\nchemise, the long winter-cafetan doubled with furs, costly cabinets,\nsachets of aromas, babooshes, stuffs of silk. When, after two hours, I\nwent from the house, I was bathed, anointed, combed, scented, and robed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have said to myself: 'I will ravage and riot in my Kingdoms. I will\nrage like the Caesars, and be a withering blight where I pass like\nSennacherib, and wallow in soft delights like Sardanapalus. I will build\nme a palace, vast as a city, in which to strut and parade my Monarchy\nbefore the Heavens, with stones of pure molten gold, and rough\nfrontispiece of diamond, and cupola of amethyst, and pillars of pearl.\nFor there were many men to the eye: but there was One only, really: and\nI was he. And always I knew it:--some faintest secret whisper which\nwhispered me: \"_You_ are the Arch-one, the _motif_ of the world, Adam,\nand the rest of men not much.\" And they are gone--all! all!--as no doubt\nthey deserved: and I, as was meet, remain. And there are wines, and\nopiums, and haschish; and there are oils, and spices, fruits and\nbivalves, and soft-breathing Cyclades, and scarlet luxurious Orients. I\nwill be restless and turbulent in my territories: and again, I will be\nlanguishing and fond. I will say to my soul: \"Be Full.\"'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI watch my mind, as in the old days I would watch a new precipitate in a\ntest-tube, to see into what sediment it would settle.\n\nI am very averse to trouble of any sort, so that the necessity for the\nsimplest manual operations will rouse me to indignation: but if a thing\nwill contribute largely to my ever-growing voluptuousness, I will\nundergo a considerable amount of labour to accomplish it, though\nwithout steady effort, being liable to side-winds and whims, and\npurposeless relaxations.\n\nIn the country I became very irritable at the need which confronted me\nof occasionally cooking some green vegetable--the only item of food\nwhich it was necessary to take some trouble over: for all meats, and\nmany fish, some quite delicious, I find already prepared in forms which\nwill remain good probably a century after my death, should I ever die.\nIn Gloucester, however, I found peas, asparagus, olives, and other\ngreens, already prepared to be eaten without base cares: and these, I\nnow see, exist everywhere in stores so vast comparatively to the needs\nof a single man, that they may be called infinite. Everything, in fact,\nis infinite compared with my needs. I take my meals, therefore, without\nmore trouble than a man who had to carve his joint, or chicken: though\neven that little I sometimes find most irksome. There remains the\ndetestable degradation of lighting fires for warmth, which I have\noccasionally to do: for the fire at the hotel invariably goes out while\nI sleep. But that is an inconvenience of this vile northern island only,\nto which I shall soon bid eternal glad farewells.\n\nDuring the afternoon of my second day in London, I sought out a strong\npetrol motor in Holborn, overhauled and oiled it a little, and set off\nover Blackfriars Bridge, making for Woolwich through that other more\nputrid London on the south river-side. One after the other, I connected,\nas I came upon them, two drays, a cab, and a private carriage, to my\nmotor in line behind, having cut away the withered horses, and using the\nreins, chain-harness, &c., as impromptu couplings. And with this novel\ntrain, I rumbled eastward.\n\nHalf-way I happened to look at my old silver chronometer of\n_Boreal_-days, which I have kept carefully wound--and how I can be still\nthrown into these sudden frantic agitations by a nothing, a nothing, my\ngood God! I do not know. This time it was only the simple fact that the\nhands chanced to point to 3.10 P.M., the precise moment at which all the\nclocks of London had stopped--for each town has its thousand weird\nfore-fingers, pointing, pointing still, to the moment of doom. In London\nit was 3.10 on a Sunday afternoon. I first noticed it going up the river\non the face of the 'Big Ben' of the Parliament-house, and I now find\nthat they all, all, have this 3.10 mania, time-keepers still, but\nkeepers of the end of Time, fixedly noting for ever and ever that one\nmoment. The cloud-mass of fine penetrating _scoriae_ must have instantly\nstopped their works, and they had fallen silent with man. But in their\ninsistence upon this particular minute I had found something so\nhideously solemn, yet mock-solemn, personal, and as it were addressed to\n_me_, that when my own watch dared to point to the same moment, I was\nthrown into one of those sudden, paroxysmal, panting turmoils of mind,\nhalf rage, half horror, which have hardly once visited me since I left\nthe _Boreal_. On the morrow, alas, another awaited me; and again on the\nsecond morrow after.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy train was execrably slow, and not until after five did I arrive at\nthe entrance-gates of the Woolwich Royal Arsenal; and seeing that it was\ntoo late to work, I uncoupled the motor, and leaving the others there,\nturned back; but overtaken by lassitude, I procured candles, stopped at\nthe Greenwich Observatory, and in that old dark pile, remained for the\nnight, listening to a furious storm. But, a-stir by eight the next\nmorning, I got back by ten to the Arsenal, and proceeded to analyse that\nvast and multiple entity. Many parts of it seemed to have been abandoned\nin undisciplined haste, and in the Cap Factory, which I first entered, I\nfound tools by which to effect entry into any desired part. My first\nsearch was for time-fuses of good type, of which I needed two or three\nthousand, and after a wearily long time found a great number\nsymmetrically arranged in rows in a range of buildings called the\nOrdnance Store Department. I then descended, walked back to the wharf,\nbrought up my train, and began to lower the fuses in bag-fulls by ropes\nthrough a shoot, letting go each rope as the fuses reached the cart.\nHowever, on winding one fuse, I found that the mechanism would not go,\nchoked with scoriae; and I had to resign myself to the task of opening\nand dusting every one: a wretched labour in which I spent that day, like\na workman. But about four I threw them to the devil, having done two\nhundred odd, and then hummed back in the motor to London.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat same evening at six I paid, for the first time, a visit to my old\nself in Harley Street. It was getting dark, and a bleak storm that\nhooted like whooping-cough swept the world. At once I saw that even _I_\nhad been invaded: for my door swung open, banging, a lowered catch\npreventing it from slamming; in the passage the car-lamp shewed me a\nyoung man who seemed a Jew, sitting as if in sleep with dropped head, a\nback-tilted silk-hat pressed down upon his head to the ears; and lying\non face, or back, or side, six more, one a girl with Arlesienne\nhead-dress, one a negress, one a Deal lifeboat's-man, and three of\nuncertain race; the first room--the waiting-room--is much more\nnumerously occupied, though there still, on the table, lies the volume\nof _Punch_, the _Gentlewoman_, and the book of London views in\nheliograph. Behind this, descending two steps, is the study and\nconsulting-room, and there, as ever, the revolving-cover oak\nwriting-desk: but on my little shabby-red sofa, a large lady much too\nbig for it, in shimmering brown silk, round her left wrist a _trousseau_\nof massive gold trinkets, her head dropped right back, almost severed by\nan infernal gash from the throat. Here were two old silver\ncandle-sticks, which I lit, and went upstairs: in the drawing-room sat\nmy old house-keeper, placidly dead in a rocking-chair, her left hand\npressing down a batch of the open piano-keys, among many strangers. But\nshe was very good: she had locked my bedroom against intrusion; and as\nthe door stands across a corner behind a green-baize curtain, it had not\nbeen seen, or, at least, not forced. I did not know where the key might\nbe, but a few thumps with my back drove it open: and there lay my bed\nintact, and everything tidy. This was a strange coming-back to it, Adam.\n\nBut what intensely interested me in that room was a big thing standing\nat the maroon-and-gold wall between wardrobe and dressing-table--that\ngilt frame--and that man painted within it there. It was myself in oils,\ndone by--I forget his name now: a towering celebrity he was, and rather\na close friend of mine at one time. In a studio in St. John's Wood, I\nremember, he did it; and many people said that it was quite a great work\nof art. I suppose I was standing before it quite thirty minutes that\nnight, holding up the bits of candle, lost in wonder, in amused contempt\nat that thing there. It is I, certainly: that I must admit. There is the\nhigh-curving brow--really a King's brow, after all, it strikes me\nnow--and that vacillating look about the eyes and mouth which used to\nmake my sister Ada say: 'Adam is weak and luxurious.' Yes, that is\nwonderfully done, the eyes, that dear, vacillating look of mine; for\nalthough it is rather a staring look, yet one can almost see the dark\npupils stir from side to side: very well done. And there is the longish\nface; and the rather thin, stuck-out moustache, shewing both lips which\npout a bit; and there is the nearly black hair; and there is the rather\nvisible paunch; and there is, oh good Heaven, the neat pink cravat--ah,\nit must have been _that--the cravat_--that made me burst out into\nlaughter so loud, mocking, and uncontrollable the moment my eye rested\nthere! 'Adam Jeffson,' I muttered reproachfully when it was over, 'could\nthat poor thing in the frame have been you?'\n\nI cannot quite state why the tendency toward Orientalism--Oriental\ndress--all the manner of an Oriental monarch--has taken full possession\nof me: but so it is: for surely I am hardly any longer a Western,\n'modern' mind, but a primitive and Eastern one. Certainly, that cravat\nin the frame has receded a million, million leagues, ten thousand\nforgotten aeons, from me! Whether this is a result due to my own\npersonality, of old acquainted with Eastern notions, or whether,\nperhaps, it is the natural accident to any mind wholly freed from\ntrammels, I do not know. But I seem to have gone right back to the very\nbeginnings, and resemblance with man in his first, simple, gaudy\nconditions. My hair, as I sit here writing, already hangs a black, oiled\nstring down my back; my scented beard sweeps in two opening whisks to my\nribs; I have on the _izar_, a pair of drawers of yomani cloth like\ncotton, but with yellow stripes; over this a soft shirt, or quamis, of\nwhite silk, reaching to my calves; over this a short vest of\ngold-embroidered crimson, the _sudeyree_; over this a khaftan of\ngreen-striped silk, reaching to the ankles, with wide, long sleeves\ndivided at the wrist, and bound at the waist with a voluminous gaudy\nshawl of Cashmere for girdle; over this a warm wide-flowing torrent of\nwhite drapery, lined with ermine. On my head is the skull-cap, covered\nby a high crimson cap with deep-blue tassel; and on my feet is a pair of\nthin yellow-morocco shoes, covered over with thick red-morocco\nbabooshes. My ankles--my ten fingers--my wrists--are heavy with gold and\nsilver ornaments; and in my ears, which, with considerable pain, I bored\nthree days since, are two needle-splinters, to prepare the holes for\nrings.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nO Liberty! I am free....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile I was going to visit my old home in Harley Street that night, at\nthe very moment when I turned from Oxford Street into Cavendish Square,\nthis thought, fiercely hissed into my ears, was all of a sudden seething\nin me: 'If now I should lift my eyes, and see a man walking yonder--just\nyonder--_at the corner there_--turning from Harewood Place into Oxford\nStreet--what, my good God, should I do?--I without even a knife to run\nand plunge into his heart?'\n\nAnd I turned my eyes--ogling, suspicious eyes of furtive\nhorror--reluctantly, lingeringly turned--and I peered deeply with\nlowered brows across the murky winds at that same spot: but no man was\nthere.\n\nHideously frequent is this nonsense now become with me--in streets of\ntowns--in deep nooks of the country: the invincible assurance that, if I\nbut turn the head, and glance _there_--at a certain fixed spot--I shall\nsurely see--I _must_ see--a man. And glance I must, glance I must,\nthough I perish: and when I glance, though my hairs creep and stiffen\nlike stirring amobse, yet in my eyes, I know, is monarch indignation\nagainst the intruder, and my neck stands stiff as sovereignty itself,\nand on my brow sits more than all the lordship of Persepolis and Iraz.\n\nTo what point of wantonness this arrogance of royalty may lead me, I do\nnot know: I will watch, and see. It is written: 'It is not good for man\nto be alone!' But good or no, the arrangement of One planet, One\ninhabitant, already seems to me, not merely a natural and proper, but\nthe _only_ natural and proper, condition; so much so, that any other\narrangement has now, to my mind, a certain improbable, wild, and\nfar-fetched unreality, like the Utopian schemes of dreamers and\nfaddists. That the whole world should have been made for _me_\nalone--that London should have been built only in order that _I_ might\nenjoy the vast heroic spectacle of its burning--that all history, and\nall civilisation should have existed only in order to accumulate for\n_my_ pleasures its inventions and facilities, its stores of purple and\nwine, of spices and gold--no more extraordinary does it all seem to me\nthan to some little unreflecting Duke of my former days seemed the\npossessing of lands which his remote forefathers seized, and slew the\noccupiers: nor, in reality, is it even so extraordinary, I being alone.\nBut what sometimes strikes me with some surprise is, not that the\npresent condition of the world, with one sole master, should seem the\ncommon-place and natural condition, but that it should have come to seem\n_so_ common-place and natural--in nine months. The mind of Adam Jeffson\nis adaptable.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI sat a long time thinking such things by my bed that night, till\nfinally I was disposed to sleep there. But I had no considerable number\nof candle-sticks, nor was even sure of candles. I remembered, however,\nthat Peter Peters, three doors away on the other side of the street,\nhad had four handsome silver candelabra in his drawing-room, each\ncontaining six stems; and I said to myself: 'I will search for candles\nin the kitchen, and if I find any, I will go and get Peter Peters'\ncandelabra, and sleep here.'\n\nI took then the two lights which I had, my good God; went down to the\npassage; then down to the basement; and there had no difficulty in\nfinding three packets of large candles, the fact being, I suppose, that\nthe cessation of gas-lighting had compelled everyone to provide\nthemselves in this way, for there were a great many wherever I looked.\nWith these I re-ascended, went into a little alcove on the second-floor\nwhere I had kept some drugs, got a bottle of carbolic oil, and for ten\nminutes went dashing all the corpses in the house. I then left the two\nlighted bits of candle on the waiting-room table, and, with the\ncar-lamp, passed along the passage to the front-door, which was very\nviolently banging. I stepped out to find that the storm had increased to\na mighty turbulence (though it was dry), which at once caught my\nclothes, and whirled them into a flapping cloud about and above me;\nalso, I had not crossed the street when my lamp was out. I persisted,\nhowever, half blinded, to Peters door. It was locked: but immediately\nnear the pavement was a window, the lower sash up, into which, with\nlittle trouble, I lifted myself and passed. My foot, as I lowered it,\nstood on a body: and this made me angry and restless. I hissed a curse,\nand passed on, scraping the carpet with my soles, that I might hurt no\none: for I did not wish to hurt any one. Even in the almost darkness of\nthe room I recognised Peters' furniture, as I expected: for the house\nwas his on a long lease, and I knew that his mother had had the\nintention to occupy it after his death. But as I passed into the\npassage, all was mere blank darkness, and I, depending upon the lamp,\nhad left the matches in the other house. I groped my way to the stairs,\nand had my foot on the first step, when I was stopped by a vicious\nshaking of the front-door, which someone seemed to be at with hustlings\nand the most urgent poundings: I stood with peering stern brows two or\nthree minutes, for I knew that if I once yielded to the flinching at my\nheart, no mercy would be shown me in this house of tragedy, and\nthrilling shrieks would of themselves arise and ring through its haunted\nchambers. The rattling continued an inordinate time, and so instant and\nimperative, that it seemed as if it could not fail to force the door.\nBut, though horrified, I whispered to my heart that it could only be the\nstorm which was struggling at it like the grasp of a man, and after a\ntime went on, feeling my way by the broad rail, in my brain somehow the\nthought of a dream which I had had in the _Boreal_ of the woman Clodagh,\nhow she let drop a fluid like pomegranate-seeds into water, and tendered\nit to Peter Peters: and it was a mortal purging draught; but I would not\nstop, but step by step went up, though I suffered very much, my brows\npeering at the utter darkness, and my heart shocked at its own rashness.\nI got to the first landing, and as I turned to ascend the second part of\nthe stair, my left hand touched something icily cold: I made some quick\ninstinctive movement of terror, and, doing so, my foot struck against\nsomething, and I stumbled, half falling over what seemed a small table\nthere. Immediately a horrible row followed, for something fell to the\nground: and at that instant, ah, I heard something--a voice--a human\nvoice, which uttered words close to my ear--the voice of Clodagh, for I\nknew it: yet not the voice of Clodagh in the flesh, but her voice\nclogged with clay and worms, and full of effort, and thick-tongued: and\nin that ghastly speech of the grave I distinctly heard the words:\n\n'_Things being as they are in the matter of the death of Peter ..._'\n\nAnd there it stopped dead, leaving me so sick, my God, so sick, that I\ncould hardly snatch my robes about me to fly, fly, fly, soft-footed,\nmurmuring in pain, down the steps, down like a sneaking thief, but\nquick, snatching myself away, then wrestling with the cruel catch of the\ndoor which she would not let me open, feeling her all the time behind\nme, watching me. And when I did get out, I was away up the length of the\nstreet, trailing my long _jubbah_, glancing backward, panting, for I\nthought that she might dare to follow, with her daring evil will. And\nall that night I lay on a common bench in the wind-tossed and dismal\nPark.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first thing which I did when the sun was up was to return to that\nplace: and I returned with hard and masterful brow.\n\nApproaching Peters' house I saw now, what the darkness had hidden from\nme, that on his balcony was someone--quite alone there. The balcony is a\nslight open-work wrought-iron structure, connected to a small roof by\nthree slender voluted pillars, two at the ends, one in the middle: and\nat the middle one I saw someone, a woman--kneeling--her arms clasped\ntight about the pillar, and her face rather upward-looking. Never did I\nsee aught more horrid: there were the gracious curves of the woman's\nbust and hips still well preserved in a clinging dress of red cloth,\nvery faded now; and her reddish hair floated loose in a large flimsy\ncloud about her; but her face, in that exposed position, had been quite\neaten away by the winds to a noseless skeleton, which grinned from ear\nto ear, with slightly-dropped under-jaw--most horrid in contrast with\nthe body, and frame of hair. I meditated upon her a long time that\nmorning from the opposite pavement. An oval locket at her throat\ncontained, I knew, my likeness: for eight years previously I had given\nit her. It was Clodagh, the poisoner.\n\nI thought that I would go into that house, and walk through it from top\nto bottom, and sit in it, and spit in it, and stamp in it, in spite of\nany one: for the sun was now high. I accordingly went in again, and up\nthe stairs to the spot where I had been frightened, and had heard the\nwords. And here a great rage took me, for I at once saw that I had been\nmade the dupe of the malign wills that beset me, and the laughing-stock\nof Those for whom I care not a fig. From a little mahogany table there I\nhad knocked sideways to the ground, in my stumble, a small phonograph\nwith a great 25-inch japanned-tin horn, which, the moment that I now\nnoticed it, I took and flung with a great racket down the stairs: for\nthat this it was which had addressed me I did not doubt; it being indeed\nevident that its clock-work mechanism had been stopped by the volcanic\nscoriae in the midst of the delivery of a record, but had been started\ninto a few fresh oscillations by the shock of the fall, making it utter\nthose thirteen words, and stop. I was sufficiently indignant at the\nmoment, but have since been glad, for I was thereby put upon the notion\nof collecting a number of cylinders with records, and have been touched\nwith indescribable sensations, sometimes thrilled, at hearing the\nsilence of this Eternity broken by those singing and speaking voices, so\nlife-like, yet most ghostly, of the old dead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, the most of that same day I spent in a high chamber at Woolwich,\ndusting out, and sometimes oiling, time-fuses: a work in which I\nacquired such facility in some hours, that each finally occupied me no\nmore than ninety to a hundred seconds, so that by evening I had, with\nthe previous day's work, close on 600. The construction of these little\nthings is very simple, and, I believe, effective, so that I should have\nno difficulty in making them myself in large numbers, if it were\nnecessary. Most contain a tiny dry battery, which sends a current along\na bell or copper wire at the running-down moment, the clocks being\ncontrived to be set for so many days, hours, and minutes, while others\nignite by striking. I arranged in rows in the covered van those which I\nhad prepared, and passed the night in an inn near the Barracks. I had\nbrought candle-sticks from London in the morning, and arranged the\nfurniture--a settee, chest-of-drawers, basin-stand, table, and a number\nof chairs--in three-quarter-circle round the bed, so getting a\ntriple-row altar of lights, mixed with vases of the house containing\nsmall palms and evergreens; with this I mingled a smell of ambergris\nfrom the scattered contents of some Turkish sachets which I had; in the\nbed a bottle of sweet Chypre-wine, with _bonbons_, nuts, and Havannas.\nAs I lay me down, I could not but reflect, with a smile which I knew to\nbe evil, upon that steady, strong, smouldering lust within me which was\nurging me through all those pains at the Arsenal, I who shirked every\nlabour as unkingly. So, however, it was: and the next morning I was at\nit again after an early breakfast, my fingers at first quite stiff with\ncold, for it blew a keen and January gale. By nine I had 820 fuses; and\njudging those sufficient to commence with, got into the motor, and took\nit round to a place called the East Laboratory, a series of detached\nbuildings, where I knew that I should find whatever I wanted: and I\nprepared my mind for a day's labour. In this place I found incredible\nstores: mountains of percussion-caps, more chambers of fuses, small-arm\ncartridges, shells, and all those murderous explosive mixtures, a-making\nand made, with which modern savagery occupied its leisure in\nexterminating itself: or, at least, savagery civilised in its top-story\nonly: for civilisation was apparently from the head downwards, and never\nonce grew below the neck in all those centuries, those people being\ncertainly much more mental than cordial, though I doubt if they were\ngenuinely mental either--reminding one rather of that composite image of\nNebuchadnezzar, head of gold, breast brazen, feet of clay--head\nman-like, heart cannibal, feet bestial--like aegipeds, and mermaids, and\npuzzling undeveloped births. However, it is of no importance: and\nperhaps I am not much better than the rest, for I, too, after all, am of\nthem. At any rate, their lyddites, melanites, cordites, dynamites,\npowders, jellies, oils, marls, and civilised barbarisms and obiahs, came\nin very well for their own destruction: for by two o'clock I had so\nworked, that I had on the first cart the phalanx of fuses; on the\nsecond a goodly number of kegs, cartridge-cases and cartridge-boxes,\nfull of powder, explosive cottons and gelatines, and liquid\nnitro-glycerine, and earthy dynamite, with some bombs, two reels of\ncordite, two pieces of tarred cloth, a small iron ladle, a shovel, and a\ncrow-bar; the cab came next, containing a considerable quantity of loose\ncoal; and lastly, in the private carriage lay four big cans of common\noil. And first, in the Laboratory, I connected a fuse-conductor with a\nhuge tun of blasting-gelatine, and I set the fuse on the ground, timed\nfor the midnight of the twelfth day thence; and after that I visited the\nMain Factory, the Carriage Department, the Ordnance Store Department,\nthe Royal Artillery Barracks, and the Powder Magazines in the Marshes,\ntraversing, as it seemed to me, miles of building; and in some I laid\nheaps of oil-saturated coal with an explosive in suitable spots on the\nground-floor near wood-work, and in some an explosive alone: and all I\ntimed for ignition at midnight of the twelfth day. Hot now, and black as\nink, I proceeded through the town, stopping with perfect system at every\nhundredth door: and I laid the faggots of a great burning: and timed\nthem all for ignition at midnight of the twelfth day.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhatever door I found closed against me I drove at it with a maniac\nmalice.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShall I commit the whole dark fact to paper?--that deep, deep secret of\nthe human organism?\n\nAs I wrought, I waxed wicked as a demon! And with lowered neck, and\nforward curve of the lower spine, and the blasphemous strut of tragic\nplay-actors, I went. For here was no harmless burning which I did--but\nthe crime of arson; and a most fiendish, though vague, malevolence, and\nthe rage to burn and raven and riot, was upon me like a dog-madness, and\nall the mood of Nero, and Nebuchadnezzar: and from my mouth proceeded\nall the obscenities of the slum and of the gutter, and I sent up such\nhisses and giggles of challenge to Heaven that day as never yet has man\nlet out. But this way lies a spinning frenzy....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have taken a dead girl with wild huggings to my bosom; and I have\ntouched the corrupted lip, and spat upon her face, and tossed her down,\nand crushed her teeth with my heel, and jumped and jumped upon her\nbreast, like the snake-stamping zebra, mad, mad...!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was desolated, however, that first day of the faggot-laying, even in\nthe midst of my sense of omnipotence, by one thing, which made me give\nsome kicks to the motor: for it was only crawling, so that a good part\nof the way I was stalking by its side; and when I came to that hill near\nthe Old Dover Road, the whole thing stopped, and refused to move, the\nweight of the train being too great for my horse-power traction. I did\nnot know what to do, and stood there in angry impotence a full\nhalf-hour, for the notion of setting up an electric station, with or\nwithout automatic stoking-gear, presented so hideous a picture of labour\nto me, that I would not entertain it. After a time, however, I thought\nthat I remembered that there was a comparatively new power station in\nSt. Paneras driven by turbines: and at once, I uncoupled the motor,\ncovered the drays with the tarpaulins, and went driving at singing\nspeed, choosing the emptier by-streets, and not caring whom I crushed.\nAfter some trouble I found, in fact, the station in an obscure by-street\nmade of two long walls, and went in by a window, a rage upon me to have\nmy will quickly accomplished. I ran up some stairs, across two rooms,\ninto a gallery containing a switch-board, and in the room below saw the\nworks, all very neat-looking, but, as I soon found, very dusty. I went\ndown, and fixed upon a generating set--there were three--that would give\na decent load, and then saw that the switch-gear belonging to this\nparticular generator was in order. I then got some cloths and thoroughly\ncleaned the dust off the commutators; ran next--for I was in a strange\nfierce haste--and turned the water into the turbines, and away went the\nengine; I hurried to set the lubricators running on the bearings, and in\na couple of minutes had adjusted the speed, and the brushes of the\ngenerators, and switched the current on to the line. By this time,\nhowever, I saw that it was getting dark, and feared that little could be\ndone that day; still, I hurried out, the station still running, got into\nthe car, and was off to look for a good electric one, of which there are\nhosts in the streets, in order at least to clean up and adjust the motor\nthat night. I drove down three by-streets, till I turned into Euston\nRoad: but I had no sooner reached it than I pulled up--with sudden\njerk--with a shout of astonishment.\n\nThat cursed street was all lighted up and gay! and three shimmering\nelectric globes, not far apart, illuminated every feature of a ghastly\nbattle-field of dead.\n\nAnd there was a thing there, the grinning impression of which I shall\ncarry to my grave: a thing which spelled and spelled at me, and ceased,\nand began again, and ceased, and spelled at me. For, above a shop which\nfaced me was a flag, a red flag with white letters, fluttering on the\ngale the words: 'Metcalfe's Stores'; and beneath the flag, stretched\nright across the house, was the thing which spelled, letter by letter,\nin letters of light: and it spelled two words, deliberately, coming to\nthe end, and going back to recommence:\n\n  _Drink_\n  ROBORAL.\n\nAnd that was the last word of civilised Man to me, Adam Jeffson--its\nfinal counsel--its ultimate gospel and message--to _me_, my good God!\n_Drink Roboral!_\n\nI was put into such a passion of rage by this blatant ribaldry, which\naffected me like the laughter of a skeleton, that I rushed from the car,\nwith the intention, I believe, of seeking stones to stone it: but no\nstones were there: and I had to stand impotently enduring that rape of\nmy eyes, its victoriously-dogged iteration, its taunting leer, its\nDrink Roboral--D, R, I, N, K R, O, B, O, R, A, L.\n\nIt was one of those electrical spelling-advertisements, worked by a\nsmall motor commutator driven by a works-motor, and I had now set it\ngoing: for on some night before that Sabbath of doom the chemist must\nhave set it to work, but finding the works abandoned, had not troubled\nto shut it down again. At any rate, this thing stopped my work for that\nday, for when I went to shut down the works it was night; and I drove to\nthe place which I had made my home in sullen and weary mood: for I knew\nthat Roboral would not cure the least of all my sores.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning I awoke in quite another frame of mind, disposed to\nidle, and let things go. After rising, dressing, washing in cold diluted\nrose-water, and descending to the _salle-\u00c3\u00a0-manger_, where I had laid my\nmorning-meal the previous evening, I promenaded an hour the only one of\nthese long sombrous tufted corridors in which there were not more than\ntwo dead, though behind the doors on either hand, all of which I had\nlocked, I knew that they lay in plenty. When I was warmed, I again went\ndown, looked into my motor, got three cylinders from one of a number of\nmotors standing near, lit up, and drove away--to Woolwich, as I thought\nat first: but instead of crossing the river by Blackfriars, I went more\neastward; and having passed from Holborn into Cheapside, which was\nimpassable, unless I crawled, was about to turn, when I noticed a\nphonograph-shop: into this I got by a side-door, suddenly seized by\nquite a curiosity to hear what I might hear. I took a good one with\nmicrophone diaphragm, and a number of record-cylinders in a\nbrass-handled box, and I put them into the car, for there was still a\nvery strong peach-odour in this closed shop, which displeased me. I then\nproceeded southward and westward through by-streets, seeking some\nprobable house into which to go from the rough cold winds, when I saw\nthe Parliament-house, and thither, turning river-ward by Westminster\nHall to Palace Yard, I went, and with my two parcels, one weighting each\narm, walked into this old place along a line of purple-dusted busts; I\ndeposited my boxes on a table beside a massive brass thing lying there,\nwhich, I suppose, must be what they called the Mace; and I sat to hear.\n\nUnfortunately, the phonograph was a clock-work one, and when I wound it,\nit would not go: so that I got very angry at my absurdity in not\nbringing an electric mechanism, as I could with much less trouble have\nput in a chemical than cleaned the clock-work; and this thing put me\ninto such a rage, that I nearly tore it to pieces, and was half for\nkicking it: but there was a man sitting in an old straight-backed chair\nquite near me, which they called the Speaker's Chair, who was in such a\npose, that he had, every time I glanced suddenly at him, precisely the\nair of bending forward with interest to watch what I was doing, a\nMohrgrabim kind of man, almost black, with Jewish nose, crinkled hair,\nkeffie, and flowing robe, probably, I should say, an Abyssinian Galla;\nwith him were only five or six people about the benches, mostly leaning\nforward with rested head, so that this place had quite a void\nsequestered mood. At all events, this Galla, or Bedouin, with his\ngrotesque interest in my doings, restrained my hands: and, finally, by\ndint of peering, poking, dusting, and adjusting, in an hour's time I got\nthe phonograph to go very well.\n\nAnd all that morning, and far into late afternoon, forgetful of food,\nand of the cold which gradually possessed me, I sat there listening,\nmusing--cylinder after cylinder: frivolous songs, orchestras, voices of\nfamous men whom I had spoken with, and shaken their solid hands,\nspeaking again to me, but thick-tongued, with hoarse effort and\ngurgles, from out the vague void beyond the grave: most strange, most\nstrange. And the third cylinder that I put on, ah, I knew, with a\nfearful start, that voice of thunder, I knew it well: it was the\npreacher, Mackay's; and many, many times over I heard those words of his\nthat day, originally spoken, it seems, when the cloud had just passed\nthe longitude of Vienna; and in all that torrent of speech not one\nsingle word of 'I told you so': but he cries:\n\n'...praise Him, O Earth, for He is He: and if He slay me, I will laugh\nraillery at His Sword, and banter Him to His face: for His Sword is\nsharp Mercy, and His poisons kill my death. Fear not, therefore, little\nflock of Man! but take my comfort to your heart to-night, and my sweets\nto your tongue: for though ye have sinned, and hardened yourselves as\nbrass, and gone far, far astray in these latter wildernesses, yet He is\ninfinitely greater than your sin, and will lead you back. Break not,\nbreak not, poor broken heart of Earth: for from Him I run herald to thee\nthis night with the sweet and secret message, that of old He chose thee,\nand once mixed conjugally with thee in an ancient sleep, O Afflicted:\nand He is thou, and thou art He, flesh of His flesh, and bone of His\nbone; and if thou perish utterly, it is that He has perished utterly,\ntoo: for thou art He. Hope, therefore, most, and cheeriest smile, at\nthe very apsis and black nadir of Despair: for He is nimble as a weasel,\nand He twists like Proteus, and His solstices and equinoxes, His tropics\nand turning-points and recurrences are innate in Being, and when He\nfalls He falls like harlequin and shuttlecocks, shivering plumb to His\nfeet, and each third day, lo, He is risen again, and His defeats are but\nthe stepping-stones and rough scaffolding from which He builds His\nParthenons, and from the densest basalt gush His rills, and the last end\nof this Earth shall be no poison-cloud, I say to you, but Carnival and\nHarvest-home ... though ye have sinned, poor hearts ...'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo Mackay, with thick-tongued metallic effort. I found this brown room\nof the Commons-house, with its green benches, and grilled galleries, so\nagreeable to my mood, that I went again the next morning, and listened\nto more records, till they tired me: for what I had was a prurient itch\nto hear secret scandals, and revelations of the festering heart, but\nthese cylinders, gathered from a shop, divulged nothing. I then went out\nto make for Woolwich, but in the car saw the poet's note-book in which I\nhad written: and I took it, went back, and was writing an hour, till I\nwas tired of that, too; and judging it too late for Woolwich that day,\nwandered about the dusty committee-rooms and recesses of this\nconsiderable place. In one room another foolishness suddenly seized upon\nme, shewing how my slightest whim has become more imperious within me\nthan all the Jaws of the Medes and Persians: for in that room, Committee\nRoom No. 15, I found an apparently young policeman lying flat on his\nback, who pleased me: his helmet tilted under his head, and near one\nwhite-gloved hand a blue official envelope; the air of that stagnant\nquiet room was still perceptibly peach-scented, and he gave not the\nslightest odour that I could detect, though he had been corporal and\nstalwart, his face now the colour of dark ashes, in each hollow cheek a\nragged hole about the size of a sixpence, the flimsy vaulted eye-lids\nwell embedded in their caverns, from under whose fringe of eye-lash\nseemed whispered the word: '_Eternity._' His hair seemed very long for a\npoliceman, or perhaps it had grown since death; but what interested me\nabout him, was the envelope at his hand: for 'what,' I asked myself,\n'was this fellow doing here with an envelope at three o'clock on a\nSunday afternoon?' This made me look closer, and then I saw by a mark at\nthe left temple that he had been shot, or felled; whereupon I was\nthrown into quite a great rage, for I thought that this poor man was\nkilled in the execution of his duty, when many of his kind perhaps, and\nmany higher than he, had fled their post to pray or riot. So, after\nlooking at him a long time, I said to him: 'Well, D. 47, you sleep very\nwell: and you did well, dying so: I am pleased with you, and to mark my\nfavour, I decree that you shall neither rot in the common air, nor burn\nin the common flames: for by my own hand shall you be distinguished with\nburial.' And this wind so possessed me, that I at once went out: with\nthe crow-bar from the car I broke the window of a near iron-monger's in\nParliament Street, got a spade, and went into Westminster Abbey. I soon\nprised up a grave-slab of some famous man in the north transept, and\ncommenced to shovel: but, I do not know how, by the time I had digged a\nfoot the whole impulse passed from me: I left off the work, promising to\nresume it: but nothing was ever done, for the next day I was at\nWoolwich, and busy enough about other matters.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the next nine days I worked with a fever on me, and a map of\nLondon before me.\n\nThere were places in that city!--secrets, vastnesses, horrors! In the\nwine-vaults at London Docks was a vat which must certainly have\ncontained between twenty and thirty thousand gallons: and with dancing\nheart I laid a train there; the tobacco-warehouse must have covered\neighty acres: and there I laid a fuse. In a house near Regent's Park,\nstanding in a garden, and shut from the street by a high wall, I saw a\nthing...! and what shapes a great city hid I now first know.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI left no quarter unremembered, taking a train, no longer of four, but\nof eight, vehicles, drawn by an electric motor which I re-charged every\nmorning, mostly from the turbine station in St. Pancras, once from a\nsteam-station with very small engine and dynamo, found in the Palace\nTheatre, which gave little trouble, and once from a similar little\nstation in a Strand hotel. With these I visited West Ham and Kew,\nFinchley and Clapham, Dalston and Marylebone; I exhausted London; I\ndeposited piles in the Guildhall, in Holloway Gaol, in the new pillared\nJustice-hall of Newgate, in the Tower, in the Parliament-house, in St.\nGiles' Workhouse, in the Crypt and under the organ of St. Paul's, in the\nSouth Kensington Museum, in the Royal Agricultural Society, in\nWhiteley's place, in the Trinity House, in Liverpool Street, in the\nOffice of Works, in the secret recesses of the British Museum; in a\nhundred inflammable warehouses, in five hundred shops, in a thousand\nprivate dwellings. And I timed them all for ignition at midnight of the\n23rd April.\n\nBy five in the afternoon of the 22nd, when I left my train in Maida\nVale, and drove alone to the solitary house on high ground near\nHampstead Heath which I had chosen, the work was well finished.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe great morning dawned, and I was early a-stir: for I had much to do\nthat day.\n\nI intended to make for the sea-shore the next morning, and had therefore\nto choose a good petrol motor, store it, and have it in a place of\nsafety; I had also to drag another vehicle after me, stored with trunks\nof time-fuses, books, clothes, and other little things.\n\nMy first journey was to Woolwich, whence I took all that I might ever\nrequire in the way of mechanism; thence to the National Gallery, where I\ncut from their frames the 'Vision of St. Helena,' Murillo's 'Boy\nDrinking,' and 'Christ at the Column'; and thence to the Embassy to\nbathe, anoint myself, and dress.\n\nAs I had anticipated, and hoped, a blustering spring gale was blowing\nfrom the north.\n\nEven as I set out from Hampstead, about 9 A.M., I had been able to guess\nthat some of my fuses had somehow anticipated the appointed hour: for I\nsaw three red hazes at various points in the air, and heard the far\nvague booming of an occasional explosion; and by 11 A.M. I felt sure\nthat a large region of north-eastern London must be in flames. With the\nsolemn feelings of bridegrooms and marriage-mornings--with a flinching,\na flinching heart, God knows, yet a heart up-buoyed on thrilling joys--I\nwent about making preparations for the Gargantuan orgy of the night.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe house at Hampstead, which no doubt still stands, is of rather\npleasing design in quite a stone and rural style, with good breadths of\nwall-surface, two plain coped gables, mullioned windows, and oversailing\nslate verge roofs, but, rather spoiling it, a high square three-storied\ntower at the south-east angle, on the topmost floor of which I had slept\nthe previous night. There I had provided myself with a jar of pale\ntobacco mixed with rose-leaves and opium, found in a foreign house in\nSeymour Street, also a genuine Saloniki hookah, together with the best\nwines, nuts, and so on, and a gold harp of the musician Krasinski,\nstamped with his name, taken from his house in Portland Street.\n\nBut so much did I find to do that day, and so many odd things turned up\nwhich I thought that I would take with me, that it was not till near six\nthat I drove finally northward through Camden Town. And now an ineffable\nawe possessed my soul at the solemn noise which everywhere encompassed\nme, an ineffable awe, a blissful terror. Never, never could I have\ndreamed of aught so great and potent. All above my head there rushed\nsouthward with wide-spread wing of haste a sparkling smoke; and mixed\nwith the immense roaring I heard mysterious hubbubs of tumblings and\nrumblings, which I could not at all comprehend, like the moving-about of\nfurniture in the houses of Titans; while pervading all the air was a\nmost weird and tearful sound, as it were threnody, and a wild wail of\npain, and dying swan-songs, and all lamentations and tribulations of the\nworld. Yet I was aware that, at an hour so early, the flames must be far\nfrom general; in fact, they had not well commenced.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs I had left a good semicircular region of houses, with a radius of\nfour hundred yards, without combustibles to the south of the isolated\nhouse which I was to occupy, and as the wind was so strongly from the\nnorth, I simply left my two vehicles at the door of the house, without\nfear of any injury: nor did any occur. I then went up to the top of the\ntower, lit the candles, and ate voraciously of the dinner which I had\nleft ready, for since the morning I had taken nothing; and then, with\nhands and heart that quivered, I arranged the clothes of the low\nspring-bed upon which to throw my frame in the morning hours. Opposite\nthe wall, where lay the bed, was a Gothic window, pretty large, with low\nsill, hung with poppy-figured muslin, and looking directly south, so\nthat I could recline at ease in the red-velvet easy-chair, and see. It\nhad evidently been a young lady's room: for on the toilette were\ncut-glass bottles, a plait of brown hair, powders, _rouge-aux-l\u00c3\u00a8vres,_\none little bronze slipper, and knick-knacks, and I loved her and hated\nher, though I did not see her anywhere. About half-past eight I sat at\nthe window to watch, all being arranged and ready at my right hand, the\ncandles extinguished in the red room: for the theatre was opened, was\nopened: and the atmosphere of this earth seemed turned into Hell, and\nHell was in my soul.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSoon after midnight there was a sudden and very visible increase in the\nconflagration. On all hands I began to see blazing structures soar, with\ngrand hurrahs, on high. In fives and tens, in twenties and thirties, all\nbetween me and the remote limit of my vision, they leapt, they lingered\nlong, they fell. My spirit more and more felt, and danced--deeper\nmysteries of sensation, sweeter thrills. I sipped exquisitely, I drew\nout enjoyment leisurely. Anon, when some more expansive angel of flame\nwould arise from the Pit with steady aspiration, and linger with\noutspread arms, and burst, I would lift a little from the chair, leaning\nforward to clap, as at some famous acting; or I would call to them in\nshouts of cheer, giving them the names of Woman. For now I seemed to see\nnothing but some bellowing pandemonic universe through crimson glasses,\nand the air was wildly hot, and my eye-balls like theirs that walk\nstaring in the inner midst of burning fiery furnaces, and my skin itched\nwith a fierce and prickly itch. Anon I touched the chords of the harp to\nthe air of Wagner's 'Walk\u00c3\u00bcren-ritt.'\n\nNear three in the morning, I reached the climax of my guilty sweets. My\ndrunken eye-lids closed in a luxury of pleasure, and my lips lay\nstretched in a smile that dribbled; a sensation of dear peace, of\nalmighty power, consoled me: for now the whole area which through\nstreaming tears I surveyed, mustering its ten thousand thunders, and\nbrawling beyond the stars the voice of its southward-rushing torment,\nbillowed to the horizon one grand Atlantic of smokeless and flushing\nflame; and in it sported and washed themselves all the fiends of Hell,\nwith laughter, shouts, wild flights, and holiday; and I--first of my\nrace--had flashed a signal to the nearer planets....\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThose words: 'signal to the nearer planets' I wrote nearly fourteen\nmonths ago, some days after the destruction of London, I being then on\nboard the old _Boreal_, making for the coast of France: for the night\nwas dark, though calm, and I was afraid of running into some ship, yet\nnot sleepy, so I wrote to occupy my fingers, the ship lying still. The\nbook in which I wrote has been near me: but no impulse to write anything\nhas visited me, till now I continue; not, however, that I have very much\nto put down.\n\nI had no intention of wearing out my life in lighting fires every\nmorning to warm myself in the inhospitable island of Britain, and set\nout to France with the view of seeking some palace in the Riviera,\nSpain, or perhaps Algiers, there, for the present at least, to make my\nhome.\n\nI started from Calais toward the end of April, taking my things along,\nthe first two days by train, and then determining that I was in no\nhurry, and a petrol motor easier, took one, and maintained a generally\nsouthern and somewhat eastern direction, ever-anew astonished at the\nwildness of the forest vegetation which, within so short a space since\nthe disappearance of man, chokes this pleasant land, even before the\ndefinite advent of summer.\n\nAfter three weeks of very slow travelling--for though I know several\ncountries very well, France with her pavered villages, hilly character,\nvines, forests, and primeval country-manner, is always new and charming\nto me--after three weeks I came unexpectedly to a valley which had never\nentered my head; and the moment that I saw it, I said: 'Here I will\nlive,' though I had no idea what it was, for the monastery which I saw\ndid not look at all like a monastery, according to my ideas: but when I\nsearched the map, I discovered that it must be La Chartreuse de\nVauclaire in P\u00c3\u00a9rigord.\n\nIt is my belief that this word 'Vauclaire' is nothing else than a\ncorruption of the Latin _Vallis Clara,_ or Bright Valley, for _l'_s and\n_u'_s did interchange about in this way, I remember: _cheval_ becoming\n_chevau(x)_ in the plural, like 'fool' and 'fou,' and the rest: which\nproves the dear laziness of French people, for the 'l' was too much\ntrouble for them to sing, and when they came to _two_ 'l's' they quite\nsuccumbed, shying that vault, or vo_u_te, and calling it some _y_. But\nat any rate, this Vauclaire, or Valclear, was well named: for here, if\nanywhere, is Paradise, and if anyone knew how and where to build and\nbrew liqueurs, it was those good old monks, who followed their Master\nwith _entrain_ in that Cana miracle, and in many other things, I fancy,\nbut aesthetically shirked to say to any mountain: 'Be thou removed.'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe general hue of the vale is a deep cerulean, resembling that blue of\nthe robes of Albertinelli's Madonnas; so, at least, it strikes the eye\non a clear forenoon of spring or summer. The monastery consists of an\noblong space, or garth, around three sides of which stand sixteen small\nhouses, with regular intervals between, all identical, the cells of the\nfathers; between the oblong space and the cells come the cloisters, with\nonly one opening to the exterior; in the western part of the oblong is\na little square of earth under a large cypress-shade, within which, as\nin a home of peace, it sleeps: and there, straight and slanting, stand\nlittle plain black crosses over graves....\n\nTo the west of the quadrangle is the church, with the hostelry, and an\nasphalted court with some trees and a fountain; and beyond, the\nentrance-gate.\n\nAll this stands on a hill of gentle slope, green as grass; and it is\nbacked close against a steep mountain-side, of which the tree-trunks are\nconjectural, for I never saw any, the trees resembling rather one\ncontinuous leafy tree-top, run out high and far over the extent of the\nmountain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was there four months, till something drove me away. I do not know\nwhat had become of the fathers and brothers, for I only found five, four\nof whom I took in two journeys in the motor beyond the church of Saint\nMartial d'Artenset, and left them there; and the fifth remained three\nweeks with me, for I would not disturb him in his prayer. He was a\nbearded brother of forty years or thereabouts, who knelt in his cell\nrobed and hooded in all his phantom white: for in no way different from\nwhatever is most phantom, visionary and eerie must a procession of these\npeople have seemed by gloaming, or dark night This particular brother\nknelt, I say, in his small chaste room, glaring upward at his Christ,\nwho hung long-armed in a little recess between the side of three narrow\nbookshelves and a projection of the wall; and under the Christ a gilt\nand blue Madonna; the books on the three shelves few, leaning different\nways. His right elbow rested on a square plain table, at which was a\nwooden chair; behind him, in a corner, the bed: a bed all enclosed in\ndark boards, a broad perpendicular board along the foot, reaching the\nceiling, a horizontal board at the side over which he got into bed,\nanother narrower one like it at the ceiling for fringe and curtain, and\nanother perpendicular one hiding the pillow, making the clean bed within\na very shady and cosy little den, on the wall of this den being another\nsmaller Christ and a little picture. On the perpendicular board at the\nfoot hung two white garments, and over a second chair at the bed-side\nanother: all very neat and holy. He was a large stern man, blond as\ncorn, but with some red, too, in his hairy beard; and appalling was the\nsignificance of those eyes that prayed, and the long-drawn cavity of\nthose saffron cheeks. I cannot explain to myself my deep reverence for\nthis man; but I had it, certainly. Many of the others, it is clear, had\nfled: but not he: and to the near-marching cloud he opposed the Cross,\nholding one real as the other--he alone among many. For Christianity was\nan _\u00c3\u00a9lite_ religion, in which all were called, but few chosen, differing\nfrom Mohammedanism and Buddhism, which grasped and conquered all within\ntheir reach: the effect of Christ rather resembling Plato's and Dante's,\nit would seem: but Mahomet's more like Homer's and Shakespeare's.\n\nIt was my way to plant at the portal the big, carved chair from the\nchancel on the hot days, and rest my soul, refusing to think of\nanything, drowsing and smoking for hours. All down there in the plain\nwaved gardens of delicious fruit about the prolonged silver thread of\nthe river Isle, whose course winds loitering quite near the foot of the\nmonastery-slope. This slope dominates a tract of distance that is not\nonly vast, but looks immense, although the horizon is bounded by a\nsemicircle of low hills, rather too stiff and uniform for perfect\nbeauty; the interval of plain being occupied by yellow ploughed lands\nwhich were never sown, weedy now, and crossed and recrossed by\nvividly-green ribbons of vine, with stretches of pale-green lucerne,\norchards, and the white village of Monpont near the railway, all\nembowered, the Isle drawing its mercurial streams through the\nvillage-meadow, which is dark with shades of oaks: and to have played\nthere a boy, and used it familiarly from birth as one's own hand or\nfoot, must have been very sweet and homely; after this, the river\ndivides, and takes the shape of a heart; and very far away are visible\nthe grey banks of the Gironde. On the semicircle of hills, when there\nwas little distance-mist, I saw the ruins of some seigneurial ch\u00c3\u00a2teau,\nfor the seigneurs, too, knew where to build; and to my left, between a\nclump of oaks and an avenue of poplars, the bell-tower of the\nvillage--church of Saint Martial d'Artenset--a very ancient type of\ntower, I believe, and common in France, rather ponderous, consisting of\na square mass with a smaller square mass stuck on, the latter having\nlarge Gothic windows; and behind me the west face of the\nmonastery-church, over the door being the statue of Saint Bruno.\n\nWell, one morning after four months, I opened my eyes in my cell to the\npiercing consciousness that I had burned Monpont over-night: and so\novercome was I with regret for this poor inoffensive little place, that\nfor two days, hardly eating, I paced between the oak and walnut pews of\nthe nave, massive stalls they are, separated by grooved Corinthian\npilasters, wondering what was to become of me, and if I was not already\nmad; and there are some little angels with extraordinarily human\nGreuze-like faces, supporting the nerves of the apse, which, after a\ntime, every time I passed them, seemed conscious of me and my existence\nthere; and the wood-work which ornaments the length of the nave, and of\nthe choir also, elaborate with carved marguerites and roses, here and\nthere took in my eyes significant forms from certain points of view; and\nthere is a partition--for the nave is divided into two chapels, one for\nthe brothers and one for the fathers, I conclude--and in this partition\na massive door, which yet looks quite light and graceful, carved with\noak and acanthus leaves, and every time I passed through I had the\nimpression that the door was a sentient thing, subconscious of me; and\nthe delicate Italian-Renaissance brick vault which springs from the vast\nnave seemed to look upon me with a gloomy knowledge of me, and of the\nheart within me; and at about four in the afternoon of the second day,\nafter pacing the church for hours, I fell down at one of the two altars\nnear that carved door of the screen, praying God to have mercy upon my\nsoul; and in the very midst of my praying, I was up and away, the devil\nin me, and I got into the motor, and did not come back to Vauclaire for\nanother month, and came leaving great tracts of burned desolation behind\nme, towns and forests, Bordeaux burned, Lebourne burned, Bergerac\nburned.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI returned to Vauclaire, for it seemed now my home; and there I\nexperienced a true, a deep repentance; and I humbled myself before my\nMaker. And while in this state, sitting one bright day in front of the\nmonastery-gate, something said to me: 'You will never be a good man, nor\npermanently escape Hell and Frenzy, unless you have an aim in life,\ndevoting yourself heart and soul to some great work, which will exact\nall your science, your thought, your ingenuity, your knowledge of modern\nthings, your strength of body and will, your skill of head and hand:\notherwise you are bound to succumb. Do this, therefore, beginning, not\nto-morrow nor this afternoon, but now: for though no man will see your\nwork, there is still the Almighty God, who is also something, in His\nway: and He will see how you strive, and try, and groan: and perhaps,\nseeing, He may have mercy upon you.'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn this way arose the idea of the Palace--an idea, indeed, which had\nentered my brain before, but merely as a bombastic and visionary outcome\nof my raving moods: now, however, in a very different way, soberly, and\nsoon concerning itself with details, difficulties, means, limitations,\nand every kind of practical matter-of-fact; and every obstruction which,\none by one, I foresaw was, one by one, as the days passed, over-borne by\nthe vigour with which that thought, rapidly becoming a mania, possessed\nme. After a week of incessant meditation, I decided Yes: and I said: I\nwill build a palace, which shall be both a palace and a temple: the\nfirst human temple worthy the King of Heaven, and the only human palace\nworthy the King of Earth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter this decision I remained at Vauclaire another week, a very\ndifferent man to the lounger it had seen, strenuous, converted, humble,\nmaking plans of this and of that, of the detail, and of the whole,\ndrawing, multiplying, dividing, adding, conic sections and the\nrule-of-three, totting up the period of building, which came out at a\nlittle over twelve years, estimating the quantities of material, weight\nand bulk, my nights full of nightmare as to the _sort_, deciding as to\nthe size and structure of the crane, forge, and work-shop, and the\nnecessarily-limited weights of their component parts, making a list of\nover 2,400 objects, and finally, up to the third week after my departure\nfrom Vauclaire, skimming through the topography of nearly the whole\nearth, before fixing upon the island of Imbros for my site.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI returned to England, and, once more, to the hollow windows and strewn\nstreets of black, burned-out and desolate London: for its bank-vaults,\netc., contained the necessary complement of the gold brought from Paris,\nand then lying in the _Speranza_ at Dover; nor had I sufficient\nfamiliarity with French industries and methods to find, even with the\naid of _Bottins_, one half of the 4,000 odd objects which I had now\ncatalogued. My ship was the _Speranza_, which brought me from Havre, for\nat Calais, to which I first went, I could find nothing suitable for all\npurposes, the _Speranza_ being an American yacht, very palatially\nfitted, three-masted, air-driven, with a carrying capacity of 2,000\ntons, Tobin-bronzed, in good condition, containing sixteen interacting\ntanks, with a five-block pulley-arrangement amid-ships that enables me\nto lift very considerable weights without the aid of the hoisting\nair-engine, high in the water, sharp, handsome, containing a few tons\nonly of sand-ballast, and needing when I found her only three days' work\nat the water-line and engines to make her decent and fit. I threw out\nher dead, backed her from the Outer to the Inner Basin to my train on\nthe quai, took in the twenty-three hundred-weight bags of gold, and the\nhalf-ton of amber, and with this alone went to Dover, thence to\nCanterbury by motor, and thence in a long train, with a store of\ndynamite from the Castle for blasting possible obstructions, to London:\nmeaning to make Dover my _d\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00b4t_, and the London rails my thoroughfare\nfrom all parts of the country.\n\nInstead of three months, as I had calculated, it took me nine: a\nharrowing slavery. I had to blast no less than forty-three trains from\nthe path of my loaded wagons, several times blasting away the metals as\nwell, and then having to travel hundreds of yards without metals: for\nthe labour of kindling the obstructing engines, to shunt them down\nsidings perhaps distant, was a thing which I would not undertake.\nHowever, all's well that ends well, though if I had it to go through\nagain, certainly I should not. The _Speranza_ is now lying seven miles\noff Cape Roca, a heavy mist on the still water, this being the 19th of\nJune at 10 in the night: no wind, no moon: cabin full of mist: and I\npretty listless and disappointed, wondering in my heart why I was such\na fool as to take all that trouble, nine long servile months, my good\nGod, and now seriously thinking of throwing the whole vile thing to the\ndevil; she pretty deep in the water, pregnant with the palace. When the\nthirty-three ...\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThose words: 'when the thirty-three' were written by me over seventeen\nyears since--long years--seventeen in number, nor have I now any idea to\nwhat they refer. The book in which I wrote I had lost in the cabin of\nthe _Speranza_, and yesterday, returning to Imbros from an hour's\naimless cruise, discovered it there behind a chest.\n\nI find now considerable difficulty in guiding the pencil, and these few\nlines now written have quite an odd look, like the handwriting of a man\nnot very proficient in the art: it is seventeen years, seventeen,\nseventeen ... ah! And the expression of my ideas is not fluent either: I\nhave to think for the word a minute, and I should not be surprised if\nthe spelling of some of them is queer. My brain has been thinking\ninarticulately perhaps, all these years: and the English words and\nletters, as they now stand written, have rather an improbable and\nforeign air to me, as a Greek or Russian book might look to a man who\nhas not so long been learning those languages as to forget the\nimpossibly foreign impression received from them on the first day of\ntackling them. Or perhaps it is only my fancy: for that I have fancies I\nknow.\n\nBut what to write? The history of those seventeen years could not be put\ndown, my good God: at least, it would take me seventeen more to do it.\nIf I were to detail the building of the palace alone, and how it killed\nme nearly, and how I twice fled from it, and had to return, and became\nits bounden slave, and dreamed of it, and grovelled before it, and\nprayed, and raved, and rolled; and how I forgot to make provision on the\nwest side for the contraction and expansion of the gold in the colder\nweather and the heats of summer, and had to break down nine months'\nwork, and how I cursed Thee, how I cursed Thee; and how the lake of wine\nevaporated faster than the conduits replenished it, and the three\njourneys which I had to take to Constantinople for shiploads of wine,\nand my frothing despairs, till I had the thought of placing the\nreservoir in the platform; and how I had then to break down the south\nside of the platform to the very bottom, and of the month-long nightmare\nof terror that I had lest the south side of the palace would undergo\nsubsidence; and how the petrol failed, and of the three-weeks' search\nfor petrol along the coast; and how, after list-rubbing all the jet, I\nfound that I had forgotten the necessary rouge for polishing; and how,\nin the third year, I found the fluate, which I had for water-proofing\nthe pores of the platform-stone, nearly all leaked away in the\n_Speranza's_ hold, and I had to get silicate of soda at Gallipoli; and\nhow, after two years' observation, I had to come to the conclusion that\nthe lake was leaking, and discovered that this Imbros sand was not\nsuitable for mixing with the skin of Portland cement which covered the\ncement concrete, and had to substitute sheet-bitumen in three places;\nand how I did all, all for the sake of God, thinking: 'I will work, and\nbe a good man, and cast Hell from me: and when I see it stand finished,\nit will be an Altar and a Testimony to me, and I shall find peace, and\nbe well': and how I have been cheated--seventeen years, long years of my\nlife--for there is no God; and how my plasterers'-hair failed me, and I\nhad to use flock, hessian, scrym, wadding, wood-street paving-blocks,\nand whatever I could find, for filling the interspaces between the\nplatform cross-walls; and of the espagnolette bolts, how a number of\nthem mysteriously disappeared, as if snatched to Hell by harpies, and I\nhad to make them; and how the crane-chain would not reach two of the\nsilver-panel castings when they were finished, and they were too heavy\nfor me to lift, and the wringing of the hands of my despair, and my\nbiting of the earth, and the transport of my fury; and how, for a whole\nwild week, I searched in vain for the text-book which describes the\nambering process; and how, when all was nearly over, in the blasting\naway of the forge and crane with dynamite, a long crack appeared down\nthe gold of the east platform-steps, and how I would not be consoled,\nbut mourned and mourned; and how, in spite of all my tribulations, it\nwas sweetly interesting to watch my power slowly grow from the first\nfeeble beginnings of the landing of materials and unloading them from\nthe motor, a hundred-weight at a time, till I could swing four tons--see\nthe solid metals flow--enjoy the gliding sounds of the handle,\ncrank-shaft, and system of levers, forcing inwards the mould-end, and\nthe upper and lower plungers, for pressing the material--build at ease\nin a travelling-cage--and watch from my hut-door through sleepless\nhours, under the electric moonlight of this land, the three piles of\ngold stones, the silver panels, the two-foot squares of jet, and be\ncomforted; and how the putty-wash--but it is past, it is past: and not\nto live over again that vulgar nightmare of means and ends have I taken\nto this writing again--but to put down something else, if I dare.\n\nSeventeen years, my good God, of that delusion! I could write down no\nsort of explanation for all those groans and griefs, at which a\nreasoning being would not shriek with laughter. I should have lived at\nease in some palace of the Middle-Orient, and burned my cities: but no,\nI must be 'a good man'--vain thought. The words of a wild madman, that\npreaching man in England who prophesied what happened, were with me,\nwhere he says: 'the defeat of Man is _His_ defeat'; and I said to\nmyself: 'Well, the last man shall not be quite a fiend, just to spite\nThat Other.' And I worked and groaned, saying: 'I will be a good man,\nand burn nothing, nor utter aught unseemly, nor debauch myself, but\nchoke back the blasphemies that Those Others shriek through my throat,\nand build and build, with moils and groans.' And it was Vanity: though I\ndo love the house, too, I love it well, for it is my home on the waste\nearth.\n\nI had calculated to finish it in twelve years, and I should undoubtedly\nhave finished it in fourteen, instead of in sixteen and seven months,\nbut one day, when the south, north, and east platform-steps were already\nfinished--it was in the July of the third year, and near sunset--as I\nleft off work, instead of going to the tent where my dinner lay ready, I\nwalked down to the ship--most strangely--in a daft, mechanical sort of\nway, without saying a word to myself, an evil-meaning smile of malice on\nmy lips; and at midnight I was lying off Mitylene, thirty miles to the\nsouth, having bid, as I thought, a last farewell to all those toils. I\nwas going to burn Athens.\n\nI did not, however: but kept on my way westward round Cape Matapan,\nintending to destroy the forests and towns of Sicily, if I found there a\nsuitable motor for travelling, for I had not been at the pains to take\nthe motor on board at Imbros; otherwise I would ravage parts of southern\nItaly. But when I came thereabouts, I was confronted with an awful\nhorror: for no southern Italy was there, and no Sicily was there, unless\na small new island, probably not five miles long, was Sicily; and\nnothing else I saw, save the still-smoking crater of Stromboli. I\ncruised northward, searching for land, and for a long time would not\nbelieve the evidence of the instruments, thinking that they wilfully\nmisled me, or I stark mad. But no: no Italy was there, till I came to\nthe latitude of Naples, it, too, having disappeared, engulfed, engulfed,\nall that stretch. From this monstrous thing I received so solemn a shock\nand mood of awe, that the evil mind in me was quite chilled and quelled:\nfor it was, and is, my belief that a wide-spread re-arrangement of the\nearth's surface is being purposed, and in all that drama, O my God, how\nshall _I_ be found?\n\nHowever, I went on my way, but more leisurely, not daring for a long\ntime to do anything, lest I might offend anyone; and, in this foolish\ncowering mind, coasted all the western coast of Spain and France during\nfive weeks, in that prolonged intensity of calm weather which now\nalternates with storms that transcend all thought, till I came again to\nCalais: and there, for the first time, landed.\n\nHere I would no longer contain myself, but burned; and that magnificent\nstretch of forest that lay between Agincourt and Abb\u00c3\u00a9ville, covering\nfive square miles, I burned; and Abb\u00c3\u00a9ville I burned; and Amiens I\nburned; and three forests between Amiens and Paris I burned; and Paris I\nburned; burning and burning during four months, leaving behind me\nsmoking districts, a long tract of ravage, like some being of the Pit\nthat blights where pass his flaming wings.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis of city-burning has now become a habit with me more enchaining--and\ninfinitely more debased--than ever was opium to the smoker, or alcohol\nto the drunkard. I count it among the prime necessaries of my life: it\nis my brandy, my bacchanal, my secret sin. I have burned Calcutta,\nPekin, and San Francisco. In spite of the restraining influence of this\npalace, I have burned and burned. I have burned two hundred cities and\ncountrysides. Like Leviathan disporting himself in the sea, so I have\nrioted in this earth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter an absence of six months, I returned to Imbros: for I was for\nlooking again upon the work which I had done, that I might mock myself\nfor all that unkingly grovelling: and when I saw it, standing there as I\nhad left it, frustrate and forlorn, and waiting its maker's hand, some\npity and instinct to build took me--for something of God was in Man--and\nI fell upon my knees, and spread my arms to God, and was converted,\npromising to finish the palace, with prayers that as I built so He\nwould build my soul, and save the last man from the enemy. And I set to\nwork that day to list-rub the last few dalles of the jet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI did not leave Imbros after that during four years, except for\noccasional brief trips to the coast--to Kilid-Bahr, Gallipoli, Lapsaki,\nGamos, Rodosto, Erdek, Erekli, or even once to Constantinople and\nScutari--if I happened to want anything, or if I was tired of work: but\nwithout once doing the least harm to anything, but containing my\nhumours, and fearing my Maker. And full of peaceful charm were those\nlittle cruises through this Levantic world, which, truly, is rather like\na light sketch in water-colours done by an angel than like the dun real\nearth; and full of self-satisfaction and pious contentment would I\nreturn to Imbros, approved of my conscience, for that I had surmounted\ntemptation, and lived tame and stainless.\n\nI had set up the southern of the two closed-lotus pillars, and the\nplatform-top was already looking as lovely as heaven, with its alternate\ntwo-foot squares of pellucid gold and pellucid jet, when I noticed one\nmorning that the _Speranza's_ bottom was really now too foul, and the\nwhim took me then and there to leave all, and clean her as far as I\ncould. I at once went on board, descended to the hold, took off my\nsudeyrie, and began to shift the ballast over to starboard, so as to\ntilt up her port bottom to the scraper. This was wearying labour, and\nabout noon I was sitting on a bag, resting in the almost darkness, when\nsomething seemed to whisper to me these words: '_You dreamed last night\nthat there is an old Chinaman alive in Pekin._' Horridly I started: I\n_had_ dreamed something of the sort, but, from the moment of waking,\ntill then, had forgotten it: and I leapt livid to my feet.\n\nI cleaned no _Speranza_ that day, nor for four days did I anything, but\nsat on the cabin-house and mused, my supporting palm among the hairy\ndraperies of my chin: for the thought of such a thing, if it could by\nany possibility be true, was detestable as death to me, changing the\ncolour of the sun, and the whole aspect of the world: and anon, at the\noutrage of that thing, my brow would flush with wrath, and my eyes\nblaze: till, on the fourth afternoon, I said to myself: 'That old\nChinaman in Pekin is likely to get burned to death, I think, or blown to\nthe clouds!'\n\nSo, a second time, on the 4th March, the poor palace was left to build\nitself. For, after a short trip to Gallipoli, where I got some young\nlime-twigs in boxes of earth, and some preserved limes and ginger, I set\nout for a long voyage to the East, passing through the Suez Canal, and\nvisiting Bombay, where I was three weeks, and then destroyed it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had the thought of going across Hindustan by engine, but did not like\nto leave my ship, to which I was very attached, not sure of finding\nanything so suitable and good at Calcutta; and, moreover, I was afraid\nto abandon my petrol motor, which I had taken on board with the\nair-windlass, since I was going to uncivilised land. I therefore coasted\ndown western Hindustan.\n\nAll that northern shore of the Arabian Sea has at the present time an\nodour which it wafts far over the water, resembling odours of happy\nvague dream-lands, sweet to smell in the early mornings as if the earth\nwere nothing but a perfume, and life an inhalation.\n\nOn that voyage, however, I had, from beginning to end, twenty-seven\nfearful storms, or, if I count that one near the Carolines, then\ntwenty-eight. But I do not wish to write of these rages: they were too\ninhuman: and how I came alive through them against all my wildest hope,\nSomeone, or Something, only knows.\n\nI will write down here a thing: it is this, my God--something which I\nhave observed: a definite obstreperousness in the mood of the elements\nnow, when once roused, which grows, which grows continually. Tempests\nhave become very very far more wrathful, the sea more truculent and\nunbounded in its insolence; when it thunders, it thunders with a venom\nnew to me, cracking as though it would split the firmament, and bawling\nthrough the heaven of heavens, as if roaring to devour all things; in\nBombay once, and in China thrice, I was shaken by earthquakes, the\nsecond and third marked by a certain extravagance of agitation, that\nmight turn a man grey. Why should this be, my God? I remember reading\nvery long ago that on the American prairies, which from time immemorial\nhad been swept by great storms, the storms gradually subsided when man\nwent to reside permanently there. If this be true, it would seem that\nthe mere presence of man had a certain subduing or mesmerising effect\nupon the native turbulence of Nature, and his absence now may have\nremoved the curb. It is my belief that within fifty years from now the\nhuge forces of the earth will be let fully loose to tumble as they will;\nand this planet will become one of the undisputed playgrounds of Hell,\nand the theatre of commotions stupendous as those witnessed on the face\nof Saturn.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Earth is all on my brain, on my brain, O dark-minded Mother, with\nthy passionate cravings after the Infinite, thy regrets, and mighty\ngriefs, and comatose sleeps, and sinister coming doom, O Earth: and I,\npoor man, though a king, sole witness of thy bleak tremendous woes. Upon\nher I brood, and do not cease, but brood and brood--the habit, if I\nremember right, first becoming fixed and fated during that long voyage\neastward: for what is in store for her God only knows, and I have seen\nin my broodings long visions of her future, which, if a man should see\nwith the eye of flesh, he would spread the arms, and wheel and wheel\nthrough the mazes of a hiccuping giggling frenzy, for the vision only is\nthe very verge of madness. If I might cease but for one hour that\nperpetual brooding upon her! But I am her child, and my mind grows and\ngrows to her like the off-shoots of the banyan-tree, that take root\ndownward, and she sucks and draws it, as she draws my feet by\ngravitation, and I cannot take wing from her: for she is greater than I,\nand there is no escaping her; and at the last, I know, my soul will\ndash itself to ruin, like erring sea-fowl upon pharos-lights, against\nher wild and mighty bosom. Often a whole night through I lie open-eyed\nin the dark, with bursting brain, thinking of that hollow Gulf of\nMexico, how identical in shape and size with the protuberance of Africa\njust opposite, and how the protuberance of the Venezuelan and Brazilian\ncoast fits in with the in-curve of Africa: so that it is obvious to\nme--it is quite _obvious_--that they once were one; and one night rushed\nso far apart; and the wild Atlantic knew that thing, and ran gladly,\nhasting in between: and how if eye of flesh had been there to see, and\near to hear that cruel thundering, my God, my God--what horror! And if\nnow they meet again, so long apart ...but that way fury lies. Yet one\ncannot help but think: I lie awake and think, for she fills my soul, and\nabsorbs it, with all her moods and ways. She has meanings, secrets,\nplans. Strange, strange, for instance, that similarity between the\nscheme of Europe and the scheme of Asia: each with three southern\npeninsulas pointing south: Spain corresponding with Arabia, Italy with\nIndia, the Morea and Greece, divided by the Gulf of Corinth,\ncorresponding with the Malay Peninsula and Annam, divided by the Gulf of\nSiam; each with two northern peninsulas pointing south, Sweden and\nNorway, and Korea and Kamschatka; each with two great islands similarly\nplaced, Britain and Ireland, and the Japanese Hondo and Yezo; the Old\nWorld and the New has each a peninsula pointing north--Denmark and\nYucatan: a forefinger with long nail--and a thumb--pointing to the Pole.\nWhat does she mean? What can she mean, O Ye that made her? Is she\nherself a living being, with a will and a fate, as sailors said that\nships were living entities? And that thing that wheeled at the Pole,\nwheels it still yonder, yonder, in its dark ecstasy? Strange that\nvolcanoes are all near the sea: I don't know why; I don't think that\nanyone ever knew. This fact, in connection with submarine explosions,\nused to be cited in support of the chemical theory of volcanoes, which\nsupposed the infiltration of the sea into ravines containing the\nmaterials which form the fuel of eruptions: but God knows if that is\ntrue. The lofty ones are intermittent--a century, two, ten, of silent\nwaiting, and then their talk silenced for ever some poor district; the\nlow ones are constant in action. Who could know the dark way of the\nworld? Sometimes they form a linear system, consisting of several vents\nwhich extend in one direction, near together, like chimneys of some long\nfoundry beneath. In mountains, a series of serrated peaks denotes the\npresence of dolomites; rounded heads mean calcareous rocks; and needles,\ncrystalline schists. The preponderance of land in the northern\nhemisphere denotes the greater intensity there of the causes of\nelevation at a remote geologic epoch: that is all that one can say about\nit: but whence that greater intensity? I have some knowledge of the\nearth for only ten miles down: but she has eight thousand miles: and\nwhether through all that depth she is flame or fluid, hard or soft, I do\nnot know, I do not know. Her method of forming coal, geysers and hot\nsulphur-springs, and the jewels, and the atols and coral reefs; the\nmetamorphic rocks of sedimentary origin, like gneiss, the plutonic and\nvolcanic rocks, rocks of fusion, and the unstratified masses which\nconstitute the basis of the crust; and harvests, the burning flame of\nflowers, and the passage from the vegetable to the animal: I do not know\nthem, but they are of her, and they are like me, molten in the same\nfurnace of her fiery heart. She is dark and moody, sudden and ill-fated,\nand rends her young like a cannibal lioness; and she is old and wise,\nand remembers Hur of the Chaldees which Uruk built, and that Temple of\nBel which rose in seven pyramids to symbolise the planets, and\nBirs-i-Nimrud, and Haran, and she bears still, as a thing of yesterday,\nold Persepolis and the tomb of Cyrus, and those cloister-like\nvih\u00c3\u00a2rah-temples of the ancient Buddhists, cut from the Himalayan rock;\nand returning from the Far East, I stopped at Ismailia, and so to Cairo,\nand saw where Memphis was, and stood one bright midnight before that\ngreat pyramid of Shafra, and that dumb Sphynx, and, seated at the well\nof one of the rock-tombs, looked till tears of pity streamed down my\ncheeks: for great is the earth, and her Ages, but man 'passeth away.'\nThese tombs have pillars extremely like the two palace-pillars, only\nthat these are round, and mine are square: for I chose it so: but the\nsame band near the top, then over this the closed lotus-flower, then the\nsmall square plinth, which separates them from the architrave, only mine\nhave no architrave; the tombs consist of a little outer temple or court,\nthen comes a well, and inside another chamber, where, I suppose, the\ndead were, a ribbon-like astragal surrounding the walls, which are\ncrowned with boldly-projecting cornices, surmounted by an abacus. And\nhere, till the pressing want of food drove me back, I remained: for more\nand more the earth over-grows me, wooes me, assimilates me; so that I\nask myself this question: 'Must I not, in time, cease to be a man, and\nbecome a small earth, precisely her copy, extravagantly weird and\nfierce, half-demoniac, half-ferine, wholly mystic--morose and\nturbulent--fitful, and deranged, and sad--like her?'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA whole month of that voyage, from May the 15th to June the 13th, I\nwasted at the Andaman Islands near Malay: for that any old Chinaman\ncould be alive in Pekin began, after some time, to seem the most\nquixotic notion that ever entered a human brain; and these jungled\nislands, to which I came after a shocking vast orgy one night at\nCalcutta, when I fired not only the city but the river, pleased my fancy\nto such an extent, that at one time I intended to abide there. I was at\nthe one called in the chart 'Saddle Hill,' the smallest of them, I\nthink: and seldom have I had such sensations of peace as I lay a whole\nburning day in a rising vale, deeply-shaded in palm and tropical\nranknesses, watching thence the _Speranza_ at anchor: for there was a\nlittle offing here at the shore whence the valley arose, and I could see\none of its long peaks lined with cocoanut-trees, and all cloud burned\nout of the sky except the flimsiest lawn-figments, and the sea as\nabsolutely calm as a lake roughened with breezes, yet making a\nconsiderable noise in its breaking on the shore, as I have noticed in\nthese sorts of places: I do not know why. These poor Andaman people seem\nto have been quite savage, for I met a number of them in roaming the\nisland, nearly skeletons, yet with limbs and vertebrae still, in\ngeneral, cohering, and in some cases dry-skinned and mummified relics of\nflesh, and never anywhere a sign of clothes: a very singular thing,\nconsidering their nearness to high old civilisations all about them.\nThey looked small and black, or almost; and I never found a man without\nfinding on or near him a spear and other weapons: so that they were\neager folk, and the wayward dark earth was in them, too, as she should\nbe in her children. They had in many cases some reddish discoloration,\nwhich may have been the traces of betel-nut stains: for betel-nuts\nabound there. And I was so pleased with these people, that I took on\nboard with the gig one of their little tree-canoes: which was my\nfoolishness: for gig and canoe were only three nights later washed from\nthe decks into the middle of the sea.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI passed down the Straits of Malacca, and in that short distance between\nthe Andaman Islands, and the S.W. corner of Borneo I was thrice so\nmauled, that at times it seemed quite out of the question that anything\nbuilt by man could escape such unfettered cataclysms, and I resigned\nmyself, but with bitter reproaches, to perish darkly. The effect of the\nthird upon me, when it was over, was the unloosening afresh of all my\nevil passion: for I said: 'Since they mean to slay me, death shall find\nme rebellious'; and for weeks I could not sight some specially happy\nvillage, or umbrageous spread of woodland, that I did not stop the ship,\nand land the materials for their destruction; so that nearly all those\nspicy lands about the north of Australia will bear the traces of my hand\nfor many a year: for more and more my voyage became dawdling and\nzigzaged, as the merest whim directed it, or the movement of the pointer\non the chart; and I thought of eating the lotus of surcease and nepenthe\nin some enchanted nook of this bowering summer, where from my hut-door I\ncould see through the pearl-hues of opium the sea-lagoon slaver lazily\nupon the old coral atol, and the cocoanut-tree would droop like slumber,\nand the bread-fruit tree would moan in sweet and weary dream, and I\nshould watch the _Speranza_ lie anchored in the pale atol-lake, year\nafter year, and wonder what she was, and whence, and why she dozed so\ndeep for ever, and after an age of melancholy peace and burdened bliss,\nI should note that sun and moon had ceased revolving, and hung inert,\nopening anon a heavy lid to doze and drowse again, and God would sigh\n'Enough,' and nod, and Being would swoon to sleep: for that any old\nChinaman should be alive in Pekin was a thing so fantastically maniac,\nas to draw from me at times sudden fits of wild red laughter that left\nme faint.\n\nDuring a space of four months, from the 18th June to the 23rd October, I\nvisited the Fijis, where I saw skulls still surrounded with remnants of\nextraordinary haloes of stiff hair, women clad in girdles made of thongs\nfixed in a belt, and, in Samoa near, bodies crowned with coronets of\nnautilus-shell, and traces of turmeric-paint and tattooing, and in one\ntownlet a great assemblage of carcasses, suggesting by their look some\nfestival, or dance: so that I believe that these people were overthrown\nwithout the least fore-knowledge of anything. The women of the Maoris\nwore an abundance of green-jade ornaments, and I found a peculiar kind\nof shell-trumpet, one of which I have now, also a tattooing chisel, and\na nicely-carved wooden bowl. The people of New Caledonia, on the other\nhand, went, I should think, naked, confining their attention to the\nhair, and in this resembling the Fijians, for they seemed to wear an\nartificial hair made of the fur of some creature like a bat, and also\nthey wore wooden masks, and great rings--for the ear, no doubt--which\nmust have fallen to the shoulders: for the earth was in them all, and\nmade them wild, perverse and various like herself. I went from one to\nthe other without any system whatever, searching for the ideal\nresting-place, and often thinking that I had found it: but only wearying\nof it at the thought that there was a yet deeper and dreamier in the\nworld. But in this search I received a check, my God, which chilled me\nto the marrow, and set me flying from these places.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne evening, the 29th November, I dined rather late--at eight--sitting,\nas was my custom in calm weather, cross-legged on the cabin-rug at the\nport aft corner, a small semicircle of _Speranza_ gold-plate before me,\nand near above me the red-shaded lamp with green conical reservoir,\nwhose creakings never cease in the stillest mid-sea, and beyond the\nplates the array of preserved soups, meat-extracts, meats, fruit,\nsweets, wines, nuts, liqueurs, coffee on the silver spirit-tripod,\nglasses, cruet, and so on, which it was always my first care to select\nfrom the store-room, open, and lay out once for all in the morning on\nrising. I was late, seven being my hour: for on that day I had been\nengaged in the occasionally necessary, but always deferred, task of\noverhauling the ship, brushing here a rope with tar, there a board with\npaint, there a crank with oil, rubbing a door-handle, a brass-fitting,\nfilling the three cabin-lamps, dusting mirrors and furniture, dashing\nthe great neat-joinered plains of deck with bucketfulls, or, high in\nair, chopping loose with its rigging the mizzen top-mast, which since a\nmonth was sprained at the clamps, all this in cotton drawers under loose\n_quamis_, bare-footed, my beard knotted up, the sun a-blaze, the sea\nsmooth and pale with the smooth pallor of strong currents, the ship\nstill enough, no land in sight, yet great tracts of sea-weed making\neastward--I working from 11 A.M. till near 7, when sudden darkness\ninterrupted: for I wished to have it all over in one obnoxious day. I\nwas therefore very tired when I went down, lit the central chain-lever\nlamp and my own two, washed and dressed in my bedroom, and sat to dinner\nin the dining-hall corner. I ate voraciously, with sweat, as usual,\npouring down my eager brow, using knife or spoon in the right hand, but\nnever the Western fork, licking the plates clean in the Mohammedan\nmanner, and drinking pretty freely. Still I was tired, and went upon\ndeck, where I had the threadbare blue-velvet easy-chair with the broken\nleft arm before the wheel, and in it sat smoking cigar after cigar from\nthe Indian D box, half-asleep, yet conscious. The moon came up into a\npretty cloudless sky, and she was bright, but not bright enough to\nout-shine the enlightened flight of the ocean, which that night was one\ncontinuous swamp of Jack-o'-lantern phosphorescence, a wild but faint\nluminosity mingled with stars and flashes of brilliance, the whole\ntrooping unanimously eastward, as if in haste with elfin momentous\npurpose, a boundless congregation, in the sweep of a strong oceanic\ncurrent. I could hear it, in my slumbrous lassitude, struggling and\ngurgling at the tied rudder, and making wet sloppy noises under the\nsheer of the poop; and I was aware that the _Speranza_ was gliding along\npretty fast, drawn into that procession, probably at the rate of four to\nsix knots: but I did not care, knowing very well that no land was within\ntwo hundred miles of my bows, for I was in longitude 173\u00c2\u00b0, in the\nlatitude of Fiji and the Society Islands, between those two: and after a\ntime the cigar drooped and dropped from my mouth, and sleep overcame\nme, and I slept there, in the lap of the Infinite.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo that something preserves me, Something, Someone: _and for what?_ ...\nIf I had slept in the cabin, I must most certainly have perished: for\nlying there on the poop, I dreamed a dream which once I had dreamed on\nthe ice, far, far yonder in the forgotten hyperborean North: that I was\nin an Arabian paradise, a Garden of Peaches; and I had a very long\nvision of it, for I walked among the trees, and picked the fruit, and\npressed the blossoms to my nostrils with breathless inhalations of love:\ntill a horrible sickness woke me: and when I opened my eyes, the night\nwas black, the moon gone down, everything wet with dew, the sky arrayed\nwith most glorious stars like a thronged bazaar of tiaraed rajahs and\nbegums with spangled trains, and all the air fragrant with that mortal\nscent; and high and wide uplifted before me--stretching from the\nnorthern to the southern limit--a row of eight or nine inflamed smokes,\nas from the chimneys of some Cyclopean foundry a-work all night, most\nsolemn, most great and dreadful in the solemn night: eight or nine, I\nshould say, or it might be seven, or it might be ten, for I did not\ncount them; and from those craters puffed up gusts of encrimsoned\nmaterial, here a gust and there a gust, with tinselled fumes that\nconvolved upon themselves, and sparks and flashes, all veiled in a\ngarish haze of light: for the foundry worked, though languidly; and upon\na rocky land four miles ahead, which no chart had ever marked, the\n_Speranza_ drove straight with the current of the phosphorus sea.\n\nAs I rose, I fell flat: and what I did thereafter I did in a state of\nexistence whose acts, to the waking mind, appear unreal as dream. I must\nat once, I think, have been conscious that here was the cause of the\ndestruction of mankind; that it still surrounded its own neighbourhood\nwith poisonous fumes; and that I was approaching it. I must have somehow\ncrawled, or dragged myself forward. There is an impression on my mind\nthat it was a purple land of pure porphyry; there is some faint memory,\nor dream, of hearing a long-drawn booming of waves upon its crags: I do\nnot know whence I have them. I think that I remember retching with\ndesperate jerks of the travailing intestines; also that I was on my face\nas I moved the regulator in the engine-room: but any recollection of\ngoing down the stairs, or of coming up again, I have not. Happily, the\nwheel was tied, the rudder hard to port, and as the ship moved, she\nmust, therefore, have turned; and I must have been back to untie the\nwheel in good time, for when my senses came, I was lying there, my head\nagainst the under gimbal, one foot on a spoke of the wheel, no land in\nsight, and morning breaking.\n\nThis made me so sick, that for either two or three days I lay without\neating in the chair near the wheel, only rarely waking to sufficient\nsense to see to it that she was making westward from that place; and on\nthe morning when I finally roused myself I did not know whether it was\nthe second or the third morning: so that my calendar, so scrupulously\nkept, may be a day out, for to this day I have never been at the pains\nto ascertain whether I am here writing now on the 5th or the 6th of\nJune.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, on the fourth, or the fifth, evening after this, just as the sun\nwas sinking beyond the rim of the sea, I happened to look where he hung\nmotionless on the starboard bow: and there I saw a clean-cut black-green\nspot against his red--a most unusual sight here and now--a ship: a poor\nthing, as it turned out when I got near her, without any sign of mast,\nheavily water-logged, some relics of old rigging hanging over, even her\nbowsprit apparently broken in the middle (though I could not see it),\nand she nothing more than a hirsute green mass of old weeds and\nsea-things from bowsprit-tip to poop, and from bulwarks to water-line,\nstout as a hedgehog, only awaiting there the next high sea to founder.\n\nIt being near my dinner-hour and night's rest, I stopped the _Speranza_\nsome fifteen yards from her, and commenced to pace my spacious poop, as\nusual, before eating; and as I paced, I would glance at her, wondering\nat her destiny, and who were the human men that had lived on her, their\nChristian names, and family names, their age, and thought, and way of\nlife, and beards; till the desire arose within me to go to her, and see;\nand I threw off my outer garments, uncovered and unroped the cedar\ncutter--the only boat, except the air-pinnace, left to me intact--and\ngot her down by the mizzen five-block pulley-system. But it was a\nridiculous nonsense, for having paddled to her, I was thrown into\nparoxysms of rage by repeated failures to scale her bulwarks, low as\nthey were; my hands, indeed, could reach, but I found no hold upon the\nslimy mass, and three rope-ends which I caught were also untenably\nslippery: so that I jerked always back into the boat, my clothes a mass\nof filth, and the only thought in my blazing brain a twenty-pound\ncharge of guncotton, of which I had plenty, to blow her to uttermost\nHell. I had to return to the _Speranza_, get a half-inch rope, then back\nto the other, for I would not be baulked in such a way, though now the\ndark was come, only slightly tempered by a half-moon, and I getting\nhungry, and from minute to minute more fiendishly ferocious. Finally, by\ndint of throwing, I got the rope-loop round a mast-stump, drew myself\nup, and made fast the boat, my left hand cut by some cursed shell: and\nall for what? the imperiousness of a whim. The faint moonlight shewed an\nample tract of deck, invisible in most parts under rolled beds of putrid\nseaweed, and no bodies, and nothing but a concave, large esplanade of\nseaweed. She was a ship of probably 1,500 tons, three-masted, and a\nsailer. I got aft (for I had on thick outer babooshes), and saw that\nonly four of the companion-steps remained; by a small leap, however, I\ncould descend into that desolation, where the stale sea-stench seemed\nconcentrated into a very essence of rankness. Here I experienced a\nsingular ghostly awe and timorousness, lest she should sink with me, or\nsomething: but striking matches, I saw an ordinary cabin, with some\nfungoids, skulls, bones and rags, but not one cohering skeleton. In the\nsecond starboard berth was a small table, and on the floor a thick\nround ink-pot, whose continual rolling on its side made me look down;\nand there I saw a flat square book with black covers, which curved\nhalf-open of itself, for it had been wet and stained. This I took, and\nwent back to the _Speranza_: for that ship was nothing but an emptiness,\nand a stench of the crude elements of life, nearly assimilated now to\nthe rank deep to which she was wedded, and soon to be absorbed into its\nnature and being, to become a sea in little, as I, in time, my God,\nshall be nothing but an earth in little.\n\nDuring dinner, and after, I read the book, with some difficulty, for it\nwas pen-written in French, and discoloured, and it turned out to be the\njournal of someone, a passenger and voyager, I imagine, who called\nhimself Albert Tissu, and the ship the _Marie Meyer_. There was nothing\nremarkable in the narrative that I could see--common-place descriptions\nof South Sea scenes, records of weather, cargoes, and the like--till I\ncame to the last written page: and that was remarkable enough. It was\ndated the 13th of April--strange thing, my good God, incredibly\nstrange--that same day, twenty long years ago, when I reached the Pole;\nand the writing on that page was quite different from the neat look of\nthe rest, proving immoderate excitement, wildest haste; and he heads it\n'_Cinq Heures_,'--I suppose in the evening, for he does not say: and he\nwrites: 'Monstrous event! phenomenon without likeness! the witnesses of\nwhich must for ever live immortalised in the annals of the universe, an\nevent which will make even Mama, Henri and Juliette admit that I was\njustified in undertaking this most eventful voyage. Talking with Captain\nTombarel on the poop, when a sudden exclamation from him--\"_Mon Dieu!_\"\nHis visage whitens! I follow the direction of his gaze to eastward! I\nbehold! eight kilom\u00c3\u00a8tres perhaps away--, _ten monstrous waterspouts_,\nreaching up, up, high enough--all apparently in one straight line, with\nintervals of nine hundred _m\u00c3\u00a8tres_, very regularly placed. They do not\nwander, dance, nor waver, as waterspouts do; nor are they at all\nlily-shaped, like waterspouts: but ten hewn pillars of water, with\nuniform diameter from top to bottom, only a little twisted here and\nthere, and, as I divine, fifty _m\u00c3\u00a8tres_ in girth. Five, ten, stupendous\nminutes we look, Captain Tombarel mechanically repeating and repeating\nunder his breath \"_Mon Dieu!_\" \"_Mon Dieu!_\" the whole crew now on the\npoop, I agitated, but collected, watch in hand. And suddenly, all is\nblotted out: the pillars of water, doubtless still there, can no more be\nseen: for the ocean all about them is steaming, hissing higher than the\npillars a dense white vapour, vast in extent, whose venomous sibilation\nwe at this distance can quite distinctly hear. It is affrighting, it is\nintolerable! the eyes can hardly bear to watch, the ears to hear! it\nseems unholy travail, monstrous birth! But it lasts not long: all at\nonce the _Marie Meyer_ commences to pitch and roll violently, and the\nsea, a moment since calm, is now rough! and at the same time, through\nthe white vapour, we see a dark shadow slowly rising--the shadow of a\nmighty back, a new-born land, bearing upwards ten flames of fire,\nslowly, steadily, out of the sea, into the clouds. At the moment when\nthat sublime emergence ceases, or seems to cease, the grand thought that\nsmites me is this: \"I, Albert Tissu, am immortalised: my name shall\nnever perish from among men!\" I rush down, I write it. The latitude is\n16\u00c2\u00b0 21' 13\" South; the longitude 176\u00c2\u00b0 58' 19\" West[1]. There is a great\ndeal of running about on the decks--they are descending. There is surely\na strange odour of almonds--I only hope--it is so dark, _mon D_----'\n\nSo the Frenchman, Tissu.\n\n\n[Footnote 1: This must be French reckoning, from meridian of Paris.]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith all that region I would have no more to do: for all here, it used\nto be said, lies a great sunken continent; and I thought it would be\nrising and shewing itself to my eyes, and driving me stark mad: for the\nearth is full of these contortions, sudden monstrous grimaces and\napparitions, which are like the face of Medusa, affrighting a man into\nspinning stone; and nothing could be more appallingly insecure than\nliving on a planet.\n\nI did not stop till I had got so far northward as the Philippine\nIslands, where I was two weeks--exuberant, odorous places, but so hilly\nand rude, that at one place I abandoned all attempt at travelling in the\nmotor, and left it in a valley by a broad, shallow, noisy river, full of\nmossy stones: for I said: 'Here I will live, and be at peace'; and then\nI had a fright, for during three days I could not re-discover the river\nand the motor, and I was in the greatest despair, thinking: 'When shall\nI find my way out of these jungles and vastnesses?' For I was where no\npaths were, and had lost myself in deeps where the lure of the earth is\ntoo strong and rank for a single man, since in such places, I suppose, a\nman would rapidly be transformed into a tree, or a snake, or a tiger. At\nlast, however, I found the place, to my great joy, but I would not shew\nthat I was glad, and to hide it, fell upon a front wheel of the car with\nsome kicks. I could not make out who the people were that lived here:\nfor the relics of some seemed quite black, like New Zealand races, and I\ncould still detect the traces of tattooing, while others suggested\nMongolian types, and some looked like pigmies, and some like whites. But\nI cannot detail the two-years' incidents of that voyage: for it is past,\nand like a dream: and not to write of that--of all that--have I taken\nthis pencil in hand after seventeen long, long years.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSingular my reluctance to put it on paper. I will write rather of the\nvoyage to China, and how I landed the motor on the wharf at Tientsin,\nand went up the river through a maize and rice-land most charming in\nspite of intense cold, I thick with clothes as an Arctic traveller; and\nof the three dreadful earthquakes within two weeks; and how the only map\nwhich I had of the city gave no indication of the whereabouts of its\nmilitary depositories, and I had to seek for them; and of the three\ndays' effort to enter them, for every gate was solid and closed; and how\nI burned it, but had to observe its flames, without deep pleasure, from\nbeyond the walls to the south, the whole place being one cursed plain;\nyet how, at one moment, I cried aloud with wild banterings and glad\nlaughters of Tophet to that old Chinaman still alive within it; and how\nI coasted, and saw the hairy Ainus, man and woman hairy alike; and how,\nlying one midnight awake in my cabin, the _Speranza_ being in a still\nglassy water under a cliff overhung by drooping trees--it was the\nharbour of Chemulpo--to me lying awake came the thought: 'Suppose now\nyou should hear a step walking to and fro, leisurely, on the poop above\nyou--_just suppose'_; and the night of horrors which I had, for I could\nnot help supposing, and at one time really thought that I heard it: and\nhow the sweat rolled and poured from my brow; and how I went to\nNagasaki, and burned it; and how I crossed over the great Pacific deep\nto San Francisco, for I knew that Chinamen had been there, too, and one\nof them might be alive; and how, one calm day, the 15th or the 16th\nApril, I, sitting by the wheel in the mid-Pacific, suddenly saw a great\nwhite hole that ran and wheeled, and wheeled and ran, in the sea, coming\ntoward me, and I was aware of the hot breath of a reeling wind, and then\nof the hot wind itself, which deep-groaned the sound of the letter _V_,\nhumming like a billion spinning-tops, and the _Speranza_ was on her\nside, sea pouring over her port-bulwarks, and myself in the corner\nbetween deck and taffrail, drowning fast, but unable to stir; but all\nwas soon past and the white hole in the sea, and the hot spinning-top of\nwind, ran wheeling beyond, to the southern horizon, and the _Speranza_\nrighted herself: so that it was clear that someone wished to destroy me,\nfor that a typhoon of such vehemence ever blew before I cannot think;\nand how I came to San Francisco, and how I burned it, and had my sweets:\nfor it was mine; and how I thought to pass over the great\ntrans-continental railway to New York, but would not, fearing to leave\nthe _Speranza_, lest all the ships in the harbour there should be\nwrecked, or rusted, and buried under sea-weed, and turned unto the sea;\nand how I went back, my mind all given up now to musings upon the earth\nand her ways, and a thought in my soul that I would return to those deep\nplaces of the Filipinas, and become an autochthone--a tree, or a snake,\nor a man with snake-limbs, like the old autochthones: but I would not:\nfor Heaven was in man, too: Earth and Heaven; and how as I steamed round\nwest again, another winter come, and I now in a mood of dismal\ndespondencies, on the very brink of the inane abyss and smiling idiotcy,\nI saw in the island of Java the great temple of Boro Budor: and like a\ntornado, or volcanic event, my soul was changed: for my recent studies\nin the architecture of the human race recurred to me with interest, and\nthree nights I slept in the temple, examining it by day. It is vast,\nwith that look of solid massiveness which above all characterises the\nJapanese and Chinese building, my measurement of its width being 529\nfeet, and it rises terrace-like in six stories to a height of about 120\nor 130 feet: here Buddhist and Brahmin forms are combined into a most\nrichly-developed whole, with a voluptuousness of tracery that is simply\nintoxicating, each of the five off-sets being divided up into an\ninnumerable series of external niches, containing each a statue of the\nsitting Boodh, all surmounted by a number of cupolas, and the whole\ncrowned by a magnificent dagop: and when I saw this, I had the impulse\nto return to my home after so long wandering, and to finish the temple\nof temples, and the palace of palaces; and I said: 'I will return, and\nbuild it as a testimony to God.'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSave for a time, near Cairo, I did not once stop on that homeward\nvoyage, but turned into the little harbour at Imbros at a tranquil\nsunset on the 7th of March (as I reckon), and I moored the _Speranza_ to\nthe ring in the little quay, and I raised the battered motor from the\nhold with the middle air-engine (battered by the typhoon in the\nmid-Pacific, which had broken it from the rope-fastenings and tumbled it\nhead-over-heels to port), and I went through the windowless\nvillage-street, and up through the plantains and cypresses which I knew,\nand the Nile mimosas, and mulberries, and Trebizond palms, and pines,\nand acacias, and fig-trees, till the thicket stopped me, and I had to\nalight: for in those two years the path had finally disappeared; and on,\non foot, I made my way, till I came to the board-bridge, and leant\nthere, and looked at the rill; and thence climbed the steep path in the\nsward toward that rolling table-land where I had built with many a\ngroan; and half-way up, I saw the tip of the crane-arm, then the blazing\ntop of the south pillar, then the shed-roof, then the platform, a\nblinking blotch of glory to the watery eyes under the setting sun. But\nthe tent, and nearly all that it contained, was gone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor four days I would do nothing, simply lying and watching, shirking a\nload so huge: but on the fifth morning I languidly began something: and\nI had not worked an hour, when a fever took me--to finish it, to finish\nit--and it lasted upon me, with only three brief intervals, nearly seven\nyears; nor would the end have been so long in coming, but for the\nunexpected difficulty of getting the four flat roofs water-tight, for I\nhad to take down half the east one. Finally, I made them of gold slabs\none-and-a-quarter inch thick, smooth on both sides, on each beam double\ngutters being fixed along each side of the top flange to catch any\nleakage at the joints, which are filled with slaters'-cement. The slabs\nare clamped to the top flanges by steel clips, having bolts set with\nplaster-of-Paris in holes drilled in the slabs. These clips are 1-1\/2\nin. by 3\/17 in., and are 17 in. apart. The roofs are slightly pitched to\nthe front edges, where they drain into gold-plated copper-gutters on\nplated wrought-iron brackets, with one side flashed up over the blocks,\nwhich raise the slabs from the beam-tops, to clear the joint gutters....\nBut now I babble again of that base servitude, which I would forget, but\ncannot: for every measurement, bolt, ring, is in my brain, like a\nburden: but it is past, it is past--and it was vanity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSix months ago to-day it was finished: six months more protracted,\ndesolate, burdened, than all those sixteen years in which I built.\n\nI wonder what a man--another man--some Shah, or Tsar, of that far-off\npast, would say now of me, if eye could rest upon me! With what awe\nwould he certainly shrink before the wild majesty of these eyes; and\nthough I am not lunatic--for I am not, I am not--how would he fly me\nwith the exclamation: 'There is the very lunacy of Pride!'\n\nFor there would seem to him--it must be so--in myself, in all about me,\nsomething extravagantly royal, touched with terror. My body has\nfattened, and my girth now fills out to a portly roundness its broad\nBabylonish girdle of crimson cloth, minutely gold-embroidered, and hung\nwith silver, copper and gold coins of the Orient; my beard, still black,\nsweeps in two divergent sheaves to my hips, flustered by every wind; as\nI walk through this palace, the amber-and-silver floor reflects in its\ndepths my low-necked, short-armed robe of purple, blue, and scarlet,\na-glow with luminous stones. I am ten times crowned Lord and Emperor; I\nsit a hundred times enthroned in confirmed, obese old Majesty. Challenge\nme who will--challenge me who dare! Among those myriad worlds upon which\nI nightly pore, I may have my Peers and Compeers and Fellow-denizens ...\nbut _here_ I am Sole; Earth acknowledges my ancient sway and hereditary\nsceptre: for though she draws me, not yet, not yet, am I hers, but she\nis mine. It seems to me not less than a million million aeons since\nother beings, more or less resembling me, walked impudently in the open\nsunlight on this planet, which is rightly mine--I can indeed no longer\npicture to myself, nor even credit, that such a state of things--so\nfantastic, so far-fetched, so infinitely droll--could have existed:\nthough, at bottom, I suppose, I know that it must have been really so.\nUp to ten years ago, in fact, I used frequently to dream that there were\nothers. I would see them walk in the streets like ghosts, and be\ntroubled, and start awake: but never now could such a thing, I think,\noccur to me in sleep: for the wildness of the circumstance would\ncertainly strike my consciousness, and immediately I should know that\nthe dream was a dream. For now, at least, I am sole, I am lord. The\ngolden walls of this palace which I have built look down, enamoured of\ntheir reflection, into a lake of the choicest, purplest wine.\n\nNot that I made it of wine because wine is rare; nor the walls of gold\nbecause gold is rare: that would have been too childish: but because I\nwould match for beauty a human work with the works of those Others: and\nbecause it happens, by some persistent freak of the earth, that\nprecisely things most rare and costly are generally the most beautiful.\n\nThe vision of glorious loveliness which is this palace now risen before\nmy eyes cannot be described by pen and paper, though there _may_ be\nwords in the lexicons of language which, if I sought for them with\ninspired wit for sixteen years, as I have built for sixteen years, might\nas vividly express my thought on paper, as the stones-of-gold, so\ngrouped and built, express it to the eye: but, failing such labours and\nskill, I suppose I could not give, if there were another man, and I\ntried to give, the faintest conception of its celestial charm.\n\nIt is a structure positively as clear as the sun, and as fair as the\nmoon--the sole great human work in the making of which no restraining\nthought of cost has played a part: one of its steps alone being of more\ncost than all the temples, mosques and besestins, the palaces, pagodas\nand cathedrals, built between the ages of the Nimrods and the Napoleons.\n\nThe house itself is very small--only 40 ft. long, by 35 broad, by 27\nhigh: yet the structure as a whole is sufficiently enormous, high\nuplifted: the rest of the bulk being occupied by the platform, on which\nthe house stands, each side of this measuring at its base 480 ft., its\nheight from top to bottom 130 ft, and its top 48 ft. square, the\nelevation of the steps being just nearly 30 degrees, and the top reached\nfrom each of the four points of the compass by 183 low long steps, very\nmassively overlaid with smooth molten gold--not forming a continuous\nflight, but broken into threes and fives, sixes and nines, with landings\nbetween the series, these from the top looking like a great terraced\nparterre of gold. It is thus an Assyrian palace in scheme: only that the\nplatform has steps on all sides, instead of on one. The platform-top,\nfrom its edge to the golden walls of the house, is a mosaic consisting\nof squares of the glassiest clarified gold, and squares of the glassiest\njet, corner to corner, each square 2 ft. wide. Around the edge of the\nplatform on top run 48 square plain gold pilasters, 12 on each side, 2\nft. high, tapering upwards, and topped by a knob of solid gold, pierced\nwith a hole through which passes a lax inch-and-a-half silver chain,\nhung with little silver balls which strike together in the breeze. The\nmansion consists of an outer court, facing east toward the sea, and the\nhouse proper, which encloses an inner court. The outer court is a hollow\noblong 32 ft. wide by 8 ft. long, the summit of its three walls being\nbattlemented; they are 18-1\/2 ft. in height, or 8-1\/2 ft. lower than the\nhouse; around their gold sides, on inside and outside, 3 ft. from the\ntop, runs a plain flat band of silver, 1 ft. wide, projecting 2\/3 in.,\nand at the gate, which is a plain Egyptian entrance, facing eastwards,\n2-1\/2 ft. narrower at top than at bottom, stand the two great square\npillars of massive plain gold, tapering upwards, 45 ft. high, with their\ncapital of band, closed lotus, and thin plinth; in the outer court,\nimmediately opposite the gate, is an oblong well, 12 ft. by 3 ft,\nreproducing in little the shape of the court, its sides, which are\ngold-lined, tapering downward to near the bottom of the platform, where\na conduit of 1\/8 in. diameter automatically replenishes the ascertained\nmean evaporation of the lake during the year, the well containing\n105,360 litres when nearly full, and the lake occupying a circle round\nthe platform of 980 ft. diameter, with a depth of 3-1\/2 ft. Round the\nwell run pilasters connected by silver chains with little balls, and it\ncommunicates by a 1\/8 in. conduit with a pool of wine let into the inner\ncourt, this being fed from eight tall and narrow golden tanks, tapering\nupwards, which surround it, each containing a different red wine,\nsufficient on the whole to last for all purposes during my lifetime. The\nground of the outer court is also a mosaic of jet and gold: but\nthenceforth the jet-squares give place throughout to squares of silver,\nand the gold-squares to squares of clear amber, clear as solidified oil.\nThe entrance is by an Egyptian doorway 7 ft. high, with folding-doors of\ngold-plated cedar, opening inwards, surrounded by a very large\nprojecting coping of plain silver, 3-1\/2 ft. wide, severe simplicity of\nline throughout enormously multiplying the effect of richness of\nmaterial. The interior resembles, I believe, rather a Homeric, than an\nAssyrian or Egyptian house--except for the 'galleries,' which are purely\nBabylonish and Old Hebrew. The inner court, with its wine-pool and\ntanks, is a small oblong of 8 ft. by 9 ft., upon which open four\nsilver-latticed window-oblongs in the same proportion, and two doors,\nbefore and behind, oblongs in the same proportion. Round this run the\neight walls of the house proper, the inner 10 ft. from the outer, each\nparallel two forming a single long corridor-like chamber, except the\nfront (east) two, which are divided into three apartments; in each side\nof the house are six panels of massive plain silver, half-an-inch\nthinner in their central space, where are affixed paintings, 22 or else\n21 taken at the burning of Paris from a place called 'The Louvre,' and 2\nor else 3 from a place in England: so that the panels have the look of\nframes, and are surrounded by oval garlands of the palest amethyst,\ntopaz, sapphire, and turquoise which I could find, each garland being of\nonly one kind of stone, a mere oval ring two feet wide at the sides and\nnarrowing to an inch at the top and bottom, without designs. The\ngalleries are five separate recesses in the outer walls under the roofs,\ntwo in the east fa\u00c3\u00a7ade, and one in the north, south, and west, hung with\npavilions of purple, blue, rose and white silk on rings and rods of\ngold, with gold pilasters and banisters, each entered by four steps from\nthe roof, to which lead, north and south, two spiral stairs of cedar. On\nthe east roof stands the kiosk, under which is the little lunar\ntelescope; and from that height, and from the galleries, I can watch\nunder the bright moonlight of this climate, which is very like\nlime-light, the for-ever silent blue hills of Macedonia, and where the\nislands of Samothraki, Lemnos, Tenedos slumber like purplish fairies on\nthe Aegean Sea: for, usually, I sleep during the day, and keep a\nnight-long vigil, often at midnight descending to bathe my coloured\nbaths in the lake, and to disport myself in that strange intoxication of\nnostrils, eyes, and pores, dreaming long wide-eyed dreams at the bottom,\nto return dazed, and weak, and drunken. Or again--_twice_ within these\nlast void and idle six months--I have suddenly run, bawling out, from\nthis temple of luxury, tearing off my gaudy rags, to hide in a hut by\nthe shore, smitten for one intense moment with realisation of the past\nof this earth, and moaning: 'alone, alone ... all alone, alone, alone\n... alone, alone....' For events precisely resembling eruptions take\nplace in my brain; and one spangled midnight--ah, how spangled!--I may\nkneel on the roof with streaming, uplifted face, with outspread arms,\nand awe-struck heart, adoring the Eternal: the next, I may strut like a\ncock, wanton as sin, lusting to burn a city, to wallow in filth, and,\nlike the Babylonian maniac, calling myself the equal of Heaven.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut it was not to write of this--of all this--!\n\nOf the furnishing of the palace I have written nothing.... But why I\nhesitate to admit to myself what I _know_, is not clear. If They speak\nto me, I may surely write of Them: for I do not fear Them, but am Their\npeer.\n\nOf the island I have written nothing: its size, climate, form,\nvegetation.... There are two winds: a north and a south wind; the north\nis cool, and the south is warm; and the south blows during the winter\nmonths, so that sometimes on Christmas-day it is quite hot; and the\nnorth, which is cool, blows from May to September, so that the summer is\nhardly ever oppressive, and the climate was made for a king. The\nmangal-stove in the south hall I have never once lit.\n\nThe length, I should say, is 19 miles; the breadth 10, or thereabouts;\nand the highest mountains should reach a height of some 2,000 ft.,\nthough I have not been all over it. It is very densely wooded in most\nparts, and I have seen large growths of wheat and barley, obviously\ndegenerate now, with currants, figs, valonia, tobacco, vines in rank\nabundance, and two marble quarries. From the palace, which lies on a\nsunny plateau of beautifully-sloping swards, dotted with the circular\nshadows thrown by fifteen huge cedars, and seven planes, I can see on\nall sides an edge of forest, with the gleam of a lake to the north, and\nin the hollow to the east the rivulet with its little bridge, and a few\nclumps and beds of flowers. I can also spy right through----\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt shall be written now:\n\nI have this day heard within me the contention of the Voices.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI thought that they were done with me! That all, all, all, was ended! I\nhave not heard them for twenty years!\n\nBut to-day--distinctly--breaking in with brawling impassioned\nsuddenness upon my consciousness.... I heard.\n\nThis late _far niente_ and vacuous inaction here have been undermining\nmy spirit; this inert brooding upon the earth; this empty life, and\nbursting brain! Immediately after eating at noon to-day, I said to\nmyself:\n\n'I have been duped by the palace: for I have wasted myself in building,\nhoping for peace, and there is no peace. Therefore now I shall fly from\nit, to another, sweeter work--not of building, but of destroying--not of\nHeaven, but of Hell--not of self-denial, but of reddest orgy.\nConstantinople--beware!' I tossed the chair aside, and with a stamp was\non my feet: and as I stood--again, again--I heard: the startlingly\nsudden wrangle, the fierce, vulgar outbreak and voluble controversy,\ntill my consciousness could not hear its ears: and one urged: 'Go! go!'\nand the other: 'Not there...! where you like, ... but not there...! for\nyour life!'\n\nI did not--for I could not--go: I was so overcome. I fell upon the couch\nshivering.\n\nThese Voices, or impulses, plainly as I felt them of old, quarrel within\nme now with an openness new to them. Lately, influenced by my long\nscientific habit of thought, I have occasionally wondered whether what I\nused to call 'the two Voices' were not in reality two strong\ninstinctive movements, such as most men may have felt, though with less\nforce. But to-day doubt is past, doubt is past: nor, unless I be very\nmad, can I ever doubt again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have been thinking, thinking of my life: there is a something which I\ncannot understand.\n\nThere was a man whom I met once in that dark backward and abysm of time,\nwhen I must have been very young--I fancy at some college or school in\nEngland, and his name now is far enough beyond scope of my memory, lost\nin the vast limbo of past things. But he used to talk continually about\ncertain 'Black' and 'White' Powers, and of their strife for this world.\nHe was a short man with a Roman nose, and lived in fear of growing a\npaunch. His forehead a-top, in profile, was more prominent than the\nnose-end, he parted his hair in the middle, and had the theory that the\nmale form was more beautiful than the female. I forget what his name\nwas--the dim clear-obscure being. Very profound was the effect of his\nwords upon me, though, I think, I used to make a point of slighting\nthem. This man always declared that 'the Black' would carry off the\nvictory in the end: and so he has, so he has.\n\nBut assuming the existence of this 'Black' and this 'White' being--and\nsupposing it to be a fact that my reaching the Pole had any connection\nwith the destruction of my race, according to the notions of that\nextraordinary Scotch parson--then it must have been the power of '_the\nBlack_' which carried me, in spite of all obstacles, to the Pole. So far\nI can understand.\n\nBut _after_ I had reached the Pole, what further use had either White or\nBlack for me? Which was it--White or Black--that preserved my life\nthrough my long return on the ice--and _why_? It _could_ not have been\n'the Black'! For I readily divine that from the moment when I touched\nthe Pole, the only desire of the Black, which had previously preserved,\nmust have been to destroy me, with the rest. It must have been 'the\nWhite,' then, that led me back, retarding me long, so that I should not\nenter the poison-cloud, and then openly presenting me the _Boreal_ to\nbring me home to Europe. But his motive? And the significance of these\nrecommencing wrangles, after such a silence? This I do not understand!\n\nCurse Them, curse Them, with their mad tangles! I care nothing for Them!\nAre there any White Idiots and Black Idiots--_at all_? Or are these\nVoices that I hear nothing but the cries of my own strained nerves, and\nI all mad and morbid, morbid and mad, mad, my good God?\n\nThis inertia here is _not good_ for me! This stalking about the palace!\nand long thinkings about Earth and Heaven, Black and White, White and\nBlack, and things beyond the stars! My brain is like bursting through\nthe walls of my poor head.\n\nTo-morrow, then, to Constantinople.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDescending to go to the ship, I had almost reached the middle of the\neast platform-steps, when my foot slipped on the smooth gold: and the\nfall, though I was not walking carelessly, had, I swear, all the\nviolence of a fall caused by a push. I struck my head, and, as I rolled\ndownward, swooned. When I came to myself, I was lying on the very bottom\nstep, which is thinly washed by the wine-waves: another roll and I\nsuppose I must have drowned. I sat there an hour, lost in amazement,\nthen crossed the causeway, came down to the _Speransa_ with the motor,\nwent through her, spent the day in work, slept on her, worked again\nto-day, till four, at both ship and time-fuses (I with only 700 fuses\nleft, and in Stamboul alone must be 8,000 houses, without counting\nGalata, Tophana, Kassim-pacha, Scutari, and the rest), started out at\n5.30, and am now at 11 P.M. lying motionless two miles off the north\ncoast of the island of Marmora, with moonlight gloating on the water, a\nfaint north breeze, and the little pale land looking immensely\nstretched-out, solemn and great, as if that were the world, and there\nwere nothing else; and the tiny island at its end immense, and the\n_Speranza_ vast, and I only little. To-morrow at 11 A.M. I will moor the\n_Speranza_ in the Golden Horn at the spot where there is that low damp\nnook of the bagnio behind the naval magazines and that hill where the\npalace of the Capitan Pacha is.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI found that great tangle of ships in the Golden Horn wonderfully\npreserved, many with hardly any moss-growths. This must be due, I\nsuppose, to the little Ali-Bey and Kezat-Hanah, which flow into the Horn\nat the top, and made no doubt a constant current.\n\nAh, I remember the place: long ago I lived here some months, or, it may\nbe, years. It is the fairest of cities--and the greatest. I believe that\nLondon in England was larger: but no city, surely, ever _seemed_ so\nlarge. But it is flimsy, and will burn like tinder. The houses are made\nof light timber, with interstices filled by earth and bricks, and some\nof them look ruinous already, with their lovely faded tints of green\nand gold and red and blue and yellow, like the hues of withered flowers:\nfor it is a city of paints and trees, and all in the little winding\nstreets, as I write, are volatile almond-blossoms, mixed with\nmaple-blossoms, white with purple. Even the most splendid of the\nSultan's palaces are built in this combustible way: for I believe that\nthey had a notion that stone-building was presumptuous, though I have\nseen some very thick stone-houses in Galata. This place, I remember,\nlived in a constant state of sensation on account of nightly flares-up;\nand I have come across several tracts already devastated by fires. The\nministers-of-state used to attend them, and if the fire would not go\nout, the Sultan himself was obliged to be there, in order to encourage\nthe firemen. Now it will burn still better.\n\nBut I have been here six weeks, and still no burning: for the place\nseems to plead with me, it is so ravishing, so that I do not know why I\ndid not live here, and spare my toils during those sixteen nightmare\nyears; for two whole weeks the impulse to burn was quieted; and since\nthen there has been an irritating whisper at my ear which said: 'It is\nnot really like the great King that you are, this burning, but like a\nfoolish child, or a savage, who liked to see fireworks: or at least, if\nyou must burn, do not burn poor Constantinople, which is so charming,\nand so very old, with its balsamic perfumes, and the blossomy trees of\nwhite and light-purple peeping over the walls of the cloistered painted\nhouses, and all those lichened tombs--those granite menhirs and regions\nof ancient marble tombs between the quarters, Greek tombs, Byzantine,\nJew, Mussulman tombs, with their strange and sacred\ninscriptions--overwaved by their cypresses and vast plane-trees.' And\nfor weeks I would do nothing: but roamed about, with two minds in me,\nunder the tropic brilliance of the sky by day, and the vast dreamy\nnights of this place that are like nights seen through azure-tinted\nglasses, and in each of them is not one night, but the thousand-and-one\nlong crowded nights of glamour and fancy: for I would sit on the immense\nesplanade of the Seraskierat, or the mighty grey stones of the porch of\nthe mosque of Sultan Mehmed-fatih, dominating from its great steps all\nold Stamboul, and watch the moon for hours and hours, so passionately\nbright she soared through clear and cloud, till I would be smitten with\ndoubt of my own identity, for whether I were she, or the earth, or\nmyself, or some other thing or man, I did not know, all being so silent\nalike, and all, except myself, so vast, the Seraskierat, and the\nSuleimanieh, and Stamboul, and the Marmora Sea, and the earth, and\nthose argent fields of the moon, all large alike compared with me, and\nmeasure and space were lost, and I with them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThese proud Turks died stolidly, many of them. In streets of\nKassim-pacha, in crowded Taxim on the heights of Pera, and under the\nlong Moorish arcades of Sultan-Selim, I have seen the open-air barber's\nrazor with his bones, and with him the half-shaved skull of the\nfaithful, and the long two-hours' narghile with traces of burnt tembaki\nand haschish still in the bowl. Ashes now are they all, and dry yellow\nbone; but in the houses of Phanar and noisy old Galata, and in the Jew\nquarter of Pri-pacha, the black shoe and head-dress of the Greek is\nstill distinguishable from the Hebrew blue. It was a mixed ritual of\ncolours here in boot and hat: yellow for Mussulman, red boots, black\ncalpac for Armenian, for the Effendi a white turban, for the Greek a\nblack. The Tartar skull shines from under a high taper calpac, the\nNizain-djid's from a melon-shaped head-piece; the Imam's and Dervish's\nfrom a grey conical felt; and there is here and there a Frank in\nEuropean rags. I have seen the towering turban of the Bashi-bazouk, and\nhis long sword, and some softas in the domes on the great wall of\nStamboul, and the beggar, and the street-merchant with large tray of\nwater-melons, sweetmeats, raisins, sherbet, and the bear-shewer, and the\nBarbary organ, and the night-watchman who evermore cried 'Fire!' with\nhis long lantern, two pistols, dirk, and wooden javelin. Strange how all\nthat old life has come back to my fancy now, pretty vividly, and for the\nfirst time, though I have been here several times lately. I have gone\nout to those plains beyond the walls with their view of rather barren\nmountain-peaks, the city looking nothing but minarets shooting through\nblack cypress-tops, and I seemed to see the wild muezzin at some summit,\ncrying the midday prayer: '_Mohammed Resoul Allah!_'--the wild man; and\nfrom that great avenue of cypresses which traverses the cemetery of\nScutari, the walled city of Stamboul lay spread entire up to Phanar and\nEyoub in their cypress-woods before me, the whole embowered now in\ntrees, all that complexity of ways and dark alleys with overhanging\nbalconies of old Byzantine houses, beneath which a rider had to stoop\nthe head, where old Turks would lose their way in mazes of the\npicturesque; and on the shaded Bosphorus coast, to Foundoucli and\nbeyond, some peeping yali, snow-white palace, or old Armenian cot; and\nthe Seraglio by the sea, a town within a town; and southward the Sea of\nMarmora, blue-and-white, and vast, and fresh as a sea just born,\nrejoicing at its birth and at the jovial sun, all brisk, alert, to the\nshadowy islands afar: and as I looked, I suddenly said aloud a wild, mad\nthing, my God, a wild and maniac thing, a shrieking maniac thing for\nHell to laugh at: for something said with my tongue: '_This city is not\nquite dead._'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThree nights I slept in Stamboul itself at the palace of some sanjak-bey\nor emir, or rather dozed, with one slumbrous eye that would open to\nwatch my visitors Sinbad, and Ali Baba, and old Haroun, to see how they\nslumbered and dozed: for it was in the small luxurious chamber where the\nbey received those speechless all-night visits of the Turks, long rosy\nhours of perfumed romance, and drunkenness of the fancy, and visionary\nlanguor, sinking toward morning into the yet deeper peace of dreamless\nsleep; and there, still, were the white _yatags_ for the guests to sit\ncross-legged on for the waking dream, and to fall upon for the final\nswoon, and the copper brazier still scenting of essence-of-rose, and the\ncushions, rugs, hangings, the monsters on the wall, the\nhaschish-chibouques, narghiles, hookahs, and drugged pale cigarettes,\nand a secret-looking lattice beyond the door, painted with trees and\nbirds; and the air narcotic and grey with the pastilles which I had\nburned, and the scented smokes which I had smoked; and I all drugged and\nmumbling, my left eye suspicious of Ali there, and Sinbad, and old\nHaroun, who dozed. And when I had slept, and rose to wash in a room near\nthe overhanging latticed balcony of the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade, before me to the north\nlay old Galata in sunshine, and that steep large street mounting to\nPera, once full at every night-fall of divans on which grave dervishes\nsmoked narghiles, and there was no space for passage, for all was\ndivans, lounges, almond-trees, heaven-high hum, chibouques in forests,\nthe dervish, and the innumerable porter, the horse-hirer with his horse\nfrom Tophana, and arsenal-men from Kassim, and traders from Galata, and\nartillery-workmen from Tophana; and on the other side of the house, the\nsouth end, a covered bridge led across a street, which consisted mostly\nof two immense blind walls, into a great tangled wilderness of flowers,\nwhich was the harem-garden, where I passed some hours; and here I might\nhave remained many days, many weeks perhaps, but that, dozing one\nfore-day with those fancied others, it was as if there occurred a laugh\nsomewhere, and a thing said: 'But this city is not quite dead!' waking\nme from deeps of peace to startled wakefulness. And I thought to myself:\n'If it be not quite dead, it _will_ be soon--and with some suddenness!'\nAnd the next morning I was at the Arsenal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is long since I have so deeply enjoyed, even to the marrow. It may be\n'the White' who has the guardianship of my life: but assuredly it is\n'the Black' who reigns in my soul.\n\nGrandly did old Stamboul, Galata, Tophana, Kassim, right out beyond the\nwalls to Phanar and Eyoub, blaze and burn. The whole place, except one\nlittle region of Galata, was like so much tinder, and in the five hours\nbetween 8 P.M. and 1 A.M. all was over. I saw the tops of those vast\nmasses of cemetery-cypresses round the tombs of the Osmanlis outside the\nwalls, and those in the cemetery of Kassim, and those round the sacred\nmosque of Eyoub, shrivel away instantaneously, like flimsy hair caught\nby a flame; I saw the Genoese tower of Galata go heading obliquely on an\nupward curve, like Sir Roger de Coverley and wild rockets, and burst\nhigh, high, with a report; in pairs, and threes, and fours, I saw the\nblue cupolas of the twelve or fourteen great mosques give in and\nsubside, or soar and rain, and the great minarets nod the head, and\ntopple; and I saw the flames reach out and out across the empty breadth\nof the Etmeidan--three hundred yards--to the six minarets of the Mosque\nof Achmet, wrapping the red Egyptian-granite obelisk in the centre; and\nacross the breadth of the Serai-Meidani it reached to the buildings of\nthe Seraglio and the Sublime Porte; and across those vague barren\nstretches that lie between the houses and the great wall; and across the\nseventy or eighty great arcaded bazaars, all-enwrapping, it reached; and\nthe spirit of fire grew upon me: for the Golden Horn itself was a tongue\nof fire, crowded, west of the galley-harbour, with exploding\nbattleships, Turkish frigates, corvettes, brigs--and east, with tens of\nthousands of feluccas, caiques, gondolas and merchantmen aflame. On my\nleft burned all Scutari; and between six and eight in the evening I had\nsent out thirty-seven vessels under low horse-powers of air, with trains\nand fuses laid for 11 P.M., to light with their wandering fires the Sea\nof Marmora. By midnight I was encompassed in one great furnace and fiery\ngulf, all the sea and sky inflamed, and earth a-flare. Not far from me\nto the left I saw the vast Tophana barracks of the Cannoniers, and the\nArtillery-works, after long reluctance and delay, take wing together;\nand three minutes later, down by the water, the barrack of the\nBombardiers and the Military School together, grandly, grandly; and\nthen, to the right, in the valley of Kassim, the Arsenal: these\noccupying the sky like smoky suns, and shedding a glaring day over many\na mile of sea and land; I saw the two lines of ruddier flaring where the\nbarge-bridge and the raft-bridge over the Golden Horn made haste to\nburn; and all that vastness burned with haste, quicker and quicker--to\nfervour--to fury--to unanimous rabies: and when its red roaring stormed\nthe infinite, and the might of its glowing heart was Gravitation, Being,\nSensation, and I its compliant wife--then my head nodded, and with\ncrooked lips I sighed as it were my last sigh, and tumbled, weak and\ndrunken, upon my face.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nO wild Providence! Unfathomable madness of Heaven! that ever I should\nwrite what now I write! I will not write it....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe hissing of it! It is only a crazy dream! a tearing-out of the hair\nby the roots to scatter upon the raving storms of Saturn! My hand will\nnot write it!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn God's name----! During four nights after the burning I slept in a\nhouse--French as I saw by the books, &c., probably the Ambassador's, for\nit has very large gardens and a beautiful view over the sea, situated on\nthe rapid east declivity of Pera; it is one of the few large houses\nwhich, for my safety, I had left standing round the minaret whence I had\nwatched, this minaret being at the top of the old Mussulman quarter on\nthe heights of Taxim, between Pera proper and Foundoucli. At the bottom,\nboth at the quay of Foundoucli, and at that of Tophana, I had left under\nshelter two caiques for double safety, one a Sultan's gilt craft, with\ngold spur at the prow, and one a boat of those zaptias that used to\npatrol the Golden Horn as water-police: by one or other of these I meant\nto reach the _Speranza_, she being then safely anchored some distance up\nthe Bosphorus coast. So, on the fifth morning I set out for the Tophana\nquay; but a light rain had fallen over-night, and this had re-excited\nthe thin grey smoke resembling quenched steam, which, as from some\nreeking province of Abaddon, still trickled upward over many a square\nmile of blackened tract, though of flame I could see no sign. I had not\naccordingly advanced far over every sort of _d\u00c3\u00a9bris_, when I found my\neyes watering, my throat choked, and my way almost blocked by roughness:\nwhereupon I said: 'I will turn back, cross the region of tombs and\nbarren waste behind Pera, descend the hill, get the zaptia boat at the\nFoundoucli quay, and so reach the _Speranza_.'\n\nAccordingly, I made my way out of the region of smoke, passed beyond the\nlimits of smouldering ruin and tomb, and soon entered a rich woodland,\nsomewhat scorched at first, but soon green and flourishing as the\njungle. This cooled and soothed me, and being in no hurry to reach the\nship, I was led on and on, in a somewhat north-western direction, I\nfancy. Somewhere hereabouts, I thought, was the place they called 'The\nSweet Waters,' and I went on with the vague notion of coming upon them,\nthinking to pass the day, till afternoon, in the forest. Here nature, in\nonly twenty years has returned to an exuberant savagery, and all was now\nthe wildest vegetation, dark dells, rills wimpling through deep-brown\nshade of sensitive mimosa, large pendulous fuchsia, palm, cypress,\nmulberry, jonquil, narcissus, daffodil, rhododendron, acacia, fig. Once\nI stumbled upon a cemetery of old gilt tombs, absolutely overgrown and\nlost, and thrice caught glimpses of little trellised yalis choked in\nboscage. With slow and listless foot I went, munching an almond or an\nolive, though I could swear that olives were not formerly indigenous to\nany soil so northern: yet here they are now, pretty plentiful, though\nelementary, so that modifications whose end I cannot see are certainly\nproceeding in everything, some of the cypresses which I met that day\nbeing immense beyond anything I ever heard of: and the thought, I\nremember, was in my head, that if a twig or leaf should change into a\nbird, or a fish with wings, and fly before my eyes, what then should I\ndo? and I would eye a branch suspiciously anon. After a long time I\npenetrated into a very sombre grove. The day outside the wood was\nbrilliant and hot, and very still, the leaves and flowers here all\nmotionless. I seemed, as it were, to hear the vacant silence of the\nworld, and my foot treading on a twig, produced the report of pistols. I\npresently reached a glade in a thicket, about eight yards across, that\nhad a scent of lime and orange, where the just-sufficient twilight\nenabled me to see some old bones, three skulls, and the edge of a\ntam-tam peeping from a tuft of wild corn with corn-flowers, and here and\nthere some golden champac, and all about a profusion of musk-roses. I\nhad stopped--_why_ I do not recollect--perhaps thinking that if I was\nnot getting to the Sweet Waters, I should seriously set about finding my\nway out. And as I stood looking about me, I remember that some cruising\ninsect trawled near my ear its lonely drone.\n\nSuddenly, God knows, I started, I started.\n\nI imagined--I dreamed--that I saw a pressure in a bed of moss and\nviolets, _recently made!_ And while I stood gloating upon that\nimpossible thing, I imagined--I dreamed--the lunacy of it!--that I heard\na laugh...! the laugh, my good God, of a human soul.\n\nOr it seemed half a laugh, and half a sob: and it passed from me in one\nfleeting instant.\n\nLaughs, and sobs, and idiot hallucinations, I had often heard before,\nfeet walking, sounds behind me: and even as I had heard them, I had\nknown that they were nothing. But brief as was this impression, it was\nyet so thrillingly _real_, that my poor heart received, as it were, the\nvery shock of death, and I fell backward into a mass of moss, supported\non the right palm, while the left pressed my working bosom; and there,\ntoiling to catch my breath, I lay still, all my soul focussed into my\nears. But now I could hear no sound, save only the vast and audible hum\nof the silence of the universe.\n\n\nThere was, however, the foot-print. If my eye and ear should so\nconspire against me, that, I thought, was hard.\n\nStill I lay, still, in that same pose, without a stir, sick and\ndry-mouthed, infirm and languishing, with dying breaths: but keen,\nkeen--and malign.\n\nI would wait, I said to myself, I would be artful as snakes, though so\nwoefully sick and invalid: I would make no sound....\n\nAfter some minutes I became conscious that my eyes were leering--leering\nin one fixed direction: and instantly, the mere fact that I had a sense\nof direction proved to me that I must, _in truth_, have heard something!\nI strove--I managed--to raise myself: and as I stood upright, feebly\nswaying there, not the terrors of death alone were in my breast, but the\nauthority of the monarch was on my brow.\n\nI moved: I found the strength.\n\nSlow step by slow step, with daintiest noiselessness, I moved to a\nthread of moss that from the glade passed into the thicket, and along\nits winding way I stepped, in the direction of the sound. Now my ears\ncaught the purling noise of a brooklet, and following the moss-path, I\nwas led into a mass of bush only two or three feet higher than my head.\nThrough this, prowling like a stealthy cat, I wheedled my painful way,\nemerged upon a strip of open long-grass, and now was faced, three yards\nbefore me, by a wall of acacia-trees, prickly-pear and pichulas, between\nwhich and a forest beyond I spied a gleam of running water.\n\nOn hands and knees I crept toward the acacia-thicket, entered it a\nlittle, and leaning far forward, peered. And there--at once--ten yards\nto my right--I saw.\n\nSingular to say, my agitation, instead of intensifying to the point of\napoplexy and death, now, at the actual sight, subsided to something very\nlike calmness. With malign and sullen eye askance I stood, and steadily\nI watched her there.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe was on her knees, her palms lightly touching the ground, supporting\nher. At the edge of the streamlet she knelt, and she was looking with a\nspecies of startled shy astonishment at the reflexion of her face in the\nlimpid brown water. And I, with sullen eye askance regarded her a good\nten minutes' space.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI believe that her momentary laugh and sob, which I had heard, was the\nresult of surprise at seeing her own image; and I firmly believe, from\nthe expression of her face, that this was the first time that she had\nseen it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNever, I thought, as I stood moodily gazing, had I seen on the earth a\ncreature so fair (though, analysing now at leisure, I can quite conclude\nthat there was nothing at all remarkable about her good looks). Her\nhair, somewhat lighter than auburn, and frizzy, was a real garment to\nher nakedness, covering her below the hips, some strings of it falling,\ntoo, into the water: her eyes, a dark blue, were wide in a most silly\nexpression of bewilderment. Even as I eyed and eyed her, she slowly\nrose: and at once I saw in all her manner an air of unfamiliarity with\nthe world, as of one wholly at a loss what to do. Her pupils did not\nseem accustomed to light; and I could swear that that was the first day\nin which she had seen a tree or a stream.\n\nHer age appeared eighteen or twenty. I guessed that she was of\nCircassian blood, or, at least, origin. Her skin was whitey-brown, or\nold ivory-white.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe stood up motionless, at a loss. She took a lock of her hair, and\ndrew it through her lips. There was some look in her eyes, which I\ncould plainly see now, somehow indicating wild hunger, though the wood\nwas full of food. After letting go her hair, she stood again feckless\nand imbecile, with sideward-hung head, very pitiable to see I think now,\nthough no faintest pity touched me then. It was clear that she did not\nat all know what to make of the look of things. Finally, she sat on a\nmoss-bank, reached and took a musk-rose on her palm, and looked\nhopelessly at it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne minute after my first actual sight of her my extravagance of\nagitation, I say, died down to something like calm. The earth was mine\nby old right: I felt that: and this creature a mere slave upon whom,\nwithout heat or haste, I might perform my will: and for some time I\nstood, coolly enough considering what that will should be.\n\nI had at my girdle the little cangiar, with silver handle encrusted with\ncoral, and curved blade six inches long, damascened in gold, and sharp\nas a razor; the blackest and the basest of all the devils of the Pit was\nwhispering in my breast with calm persistence: 'Kill, kill--and eat.'\n\n_Why_ I should have killed her I do not know. That question I now ask\nmyself. It must be true, true that it is '_not good_' for man to be\nalone. There was a religious sect in the Past which called itself\n'Socialist': and with these must have been the truth, man being at his\nbest and highest when most social, and at his worst and lowest when\nisolated: for the Earth gets hold of all isolation, and draws it, and\nmakes it fierce, base, and materialistic, like sultans, aristocracies,\nand the like: but Heaven is where two or three are gathered together. It\nmay be so: I do not know, nor care. But I know that after twenty years\nof solitude on a planet the human soul is more enamoured of solitude\nthan of life, shrinking like a tender nerve from the rough intrusion of\nAnother into the secret realm of Self: and hence, perhaps, the\nbitterness with which solitary castes, Brahmins, patricians,\naristocracies, always resisted any attempt to invade their\nslowly-acquired domain of privileges. Also, it may be true, it may, it\nmay, that after twenty years of solitary selfishness, a man becomes,\nwithout suspecting it--not at all noticing the slow stages--a real and\ntrue beast, a horrible, hideous beast, mad, prowling, like that King of\nBabylon, his nails like birds' claws, and his hair like eagles'\nfeathers, with instincts all inflamed and fierce, delighting in\ndarkness and crime for their own sake. I do not know, nor care: but I\nknow that, as I drew the cangiar, the basest and the slyest of all the\ndevils was whispering me, tongue in cheek: 'Kill, kill--and be merry.'\n\nWith excruciating slowness, like a crawling glacier, tender as a nerve\nof the touching leaves, I moved, I stole, obliquely toward her through\nthe wall of bush, the knife behind my back. Once only there was a\nrestraint, a check: I felt myself held back: I had to stop: for one of\nthe ends of my divided beard had caught in a limb of prickly-pear.\n\nI set to disentangling it: and it was, I believe, at the moment of\nsucceeding that I first noticed the state of the sky, a strip of which I\ncould see across the rivulet: a minute or so before it had been pretty\nclear, but now was busy with hurrying clouds. It was a sinister\nmuttering of thunder which had made me glance upward.\n\nWhen my eyes returned to the sitting figure, she was looking foolishly\nabout the sky with an expression which almost proved that she had never\nbefore heard that sound of thunder, or at least had no idea what it\ncould bode. My fixed regard lost not one of her movements, while inch by\ninch, not breathing, careful as the poise of a balance, I crawled. And\nsuddenly, with a rush, I was out in the open, running her down....\n\nShe leapt: perhaps two, perhaps three, paces she fled: then stock still\nshe stood--within some four yards of me--with panting nostrils, with\nenquiring face.\n\nI saw it all in one instant, and in one instant all was over. I had not\nchecked the impetus of my run at her stoppage, and I was on the point of\nreaching her with uplifted knife, when I was suddenly checked and\nsmitten by a stupendous violence: a flash of blinding light, attracted\nby the steel which I held, struck tingling through my frame, and at the\nsame time the most passionate crash of thunder that ever shocked a poor\nhuman ear felled me to the ground. The cangiar, snatched from my hand,\nfell near the girl's foot.\n\nI did not entirely lose consciousness, though, surely, the Powers no\nlonger hide themselves from me, and their close contact is too\nintolerably rough and vigorous for a poor mortal man. During, I should\nthink, three or four minutes, I lay so astounded under that bullying cry\nof wrath, that I could not move a finger. When at last I did sit up, the\ngirl was standing near me, with a sort of smile, holding out to me the\ncangiar in a pouring rain.\n\nI took it from her, and my doddering fingers dropped it into the\nstream.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPour, pour came the rain, raining as it can in this place, not long, but\na deluge while it lasts, dripping in thick-liquidity, like a profuse\nsweat, through the forest, I seeking to get back by the way I had come,\nflying, but with difficulty and slowness, and a feeling in me that I was\nbeing tracked. And so it proved: for when I struck into more open space,\nnearly opposite the west walls, but now on the north side of the Golden\nHorn, where there is a flat grassy ground somewhere between the valley\nof Kassim and Charkoi, with horror I saw that _prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9e_ of Heaven, or\nof someone, not ten yards behind, following me like a mechanical figure,\nit being now near three in the afternoon, and the rain drenching me\nthrough, and I tired and hungry, and from all the ruins of\nConstantinople not one whiff of smoke ascending.\n\nI trudged on wearily till I came to the quay of Foundoucli, and the\nzaptia boat; and there she was with me still, her hair nothing but a\nthin drowned string down her back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNot only can she not speak to me in any language that I know: but she\ncan speak in _no_ language: it is my firm belief that she has _never_\nspoken.\n\nShe never saw a boat, or water, or the world, till now--I could swear\nit. She came into the boat with me, and sat astern, clinging for dear\nlife to the gunwale by her finger-nails, and I paddled the eight hundred\nyards to the _Speranza_, and she came up to the deck after me. When she\nsaw the open water, the boat, the yalis on the coast, and then the ship,\nastonishment was imprinted on her face. But she appears to know little\nfear. She smiled like a child, and on the ship touched this and that, as\nif each were a living thing.\n\nIt was only here and there that one could see the ivory-brown colour of\nher skin: the rest was covered with dirt, like old bottles long lying in\ncellars.\n\nBy the time we reached the _Speranza_, the rain suddenly stopped: I went\ndown to my cabin to change my clothes, and had to shut the door in her\nface to keep her out. When I opened it, she was there, and she followed\nme to the windlass, when I went to set the anchor-engine going. I\nintended, I suppose, to take her to Imbros, where she might live in one\nof the broken-down houses of the village. But when the anchor was not\nyet half up, I stopped the engine, and let the chain run again. For I\nsaid, 'No, I will be alone, I am not a child.'\n\nI knew that she was hungry by the look in her eyes: but I cared nothing\nfor that. I was hungry, too: and that was all I cared about.\n\nI would not let her be there with me another instant. I got down into\nthe boat, and when she followed, I rowed her back all the way past\nFoundoucli and the Tophana quay to where one turns into the Golden Horn\nby St. Sophia, around the mouth of the Horn being a vast semicircle of\ncharred wreckage, carried out by the river-currents. I went up the steps\non the Galata side before one comes to where the barge-bridge was. When\nshe had followed me on to the embankment, I walked up one of those\nrising streets, very encumbered now with stone-_d\u00c3\u00a9bris_ and ashes, but\nstill marked by some standing black wall-fragments, it being now not far\nfrom night, but the air as clear and washed as the translucency of a\ngreat purple diamond with the rain and the afterglow of the sun, and all\nthe west aflame.\n\nWhen I was about a hundred yards up in this old mixed quarter of Greeks,\nTurks, Jews, Italians, Albanians, and noise and cafedjis and\nwine-bibbing, having turned two corners, I suddenly gathered my skirts,\nspun round, and, as fast as I could, was off at a heavy trot back to\nthe quay. She was after me, but being taken by surprise, I suppose, was\ndistanced a little at first. However, by the time I could scurry myself\ndown into the boat, she was so near, that she only saved herself from\nthe water by a balancing stoppage at the brink, as I pushed off. I then\nset out to get back to the ship, muttering: 'You can have Turkey, if you\nlike, and I will keep the rest of the world.'\n\nI rowed sea-ward, my face toward her, but steadily averted, for I would\nnot look her way to see what she was doing. However, as I turned the\npoint of the quay, where the open sea washes quite rough and loud, to go\nnorthward and disappear from her, I heard a babbling cry--the first\nsound which she had uttered. I did look then: and she was still quite\nnear me, for the silly maniac had been running along the embankment,\nfollowing me.\n\n'Little fool!' I cried out across the water, 'what are you after now?'\nAnd, oh my good God, shall I ever forget that strangeness, that wild\nstrangeness, of my own voice, addressing on this earth another human\nsoul?\n\nThere she stood, whimpering like an abandoned dog after me. I turned the\nboat, rowed, came to the first steps, landed, and struck her two\nstinging slaps, one on each cheek. While she cowered, surprised no\ndoubt, I took her by the hand, led her back to the boat, landed on the\nStamboul side, and set off, still leading her, my object being to find\nsome sort of possible edifice near by, not hopelessly burned, in which\nto leave her: for in all Galata there was plainly none, and Pera, I\nthought, was too far to walk to. But it would have been better if I had\ngone to Pera, for we had to walk quite three miles from Seraglio Point\nall along the city battlements to the Seven-towers, she picking her\nbare-footed way after me through the great Sahara of charred stuff, and\nnight now well arrived, and the moon a-drift in the heaven, making the\ndesolate lonesomeness of the ruins tenfold desolate, so that my heart\nsmote me then with bitterness and remorse, and I had a vision of myself\nthat night which I will not put down on paper. At last, however, pretty\nlate in the evening, I spied a large mansion with green lattice-work\nfa\u00c3\u00a7ade, and shaknisier, and terrace-roof, which had been hidden from me\nby the arcades of a bazaar, a vast open space at about the centre of\nStamboul, one of the largest of the bazaars, I should think, in the\nmiddle of which stood the mansion, probably the home of pasha or vizier:\nfor it had a very distinguished look in that place. It seemed very\nlittle hurt, though the vegetation that had apparently choked the great\nopen space was singed to a black fluff, among which lay thousands of\ncalcined bones of man, horse, ass, and camel, for all was distinct in\nthe bright, yet so pensive and forlorn, moonlight, which was that\nEastern moonlight of pure astral mystery which illumines Persepolis, and\nBabylon, and ruined cities of the old Anakim.\n\nThe house, I knew, would contain divans, _yatags_, cushions, foods,\nwines, sherbets, henna, saffron, mastic, raki, haschish, costumes, and a\nhundred luxuries still good. There was an outer wall, but the foliage\nover it had been singed away, and the gate all charred. It gave way at a\npush from my palm. The girl was close behind me. I next threw open a\nlittle green lattice-door in the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade under the shaknisier, and\nentered. Here it was dark, and the moment that she, too, was within, I\nslipped out quickly, slammed the door in her face, and hooked it upon\nher by a little hook over the latch.\n\nI now walked some yards beyond the court, then stopped, listening for\nher expected cry: but all was still: five minutes--ten--I waited: but no\nsound. I then continued my morose and melancholy way, hollow with\nhunger, intending to start that night for Imbros.\n\nBut this time I had hardly advanced twenty steps, when I heard a frail\nand strangled cry, apparently in mid-air behind me, and glancing, saw\nthe creature lying at the gateway, a white thing in black stubble-ashes.\nShe had evidently jumped, well outward, from a small casement of lattice\non a level with the little shaknisier grating, through which once peeped\nbright eyes, thirty feet aloft.\n\nI hardly believe that she was conscious of any danger in jumping, for\nall the laws of life are new to her, and, having sought and found the\nopening, she may have merely come with blind instinctiveness after me,\ntaking the first way open to her. I walked back, pulled at her arm, and\nfound that she could not stand. Her face was screwed with silent\npain--she did not moan. Her left foot, I could see, was bleeding: and by\nthe wounded ankle I took her, and dragged her so through the ashes\nacross the narrow court, and tossed her like a little dog with all my\nforce within the door, cursing her.\n\nNow I would not go back the long way to the ship, but struck a match,\nand went lighting up girandoles, cressets, candelabra, into a confusion\nof lights among great numbers of pale-tinted pillars, rose and azure,\nwith verd-antique, olive, and Portoro marble, and serpentine. The\nmansion was large, I having to traverse quite a desert of embroidered\nbrocade-hangings, slender columns, and Broussa silks, till I saw a\nstair-case doorway behind a Smyrna _porti\u00c3\u00a8re_, went up, and wandered\nsome time in a house of gilt-barred windows, with very little furniture,\nbut palatial spaces, solitary huge pieces of _fa\u00c3\u00afence_ of inestimable\nage, and arms, my footfalls quite stifled in the Persian carpeting. I\npassed through a covered-in hanging-gallery, with one window-grating\noverlooking an inner court, and by this entered the harem, which\ndeclared itself by a greater luxury, bric-\u00c3\u00a0-bracerie, and profusion of\nmanner. Here, descending a short curved stair behind a _porti\u00c3\u00a8re_, I\ncame into a marble-paved sort of larder, in which was an old negress in\nblue dress, her hair still adhering, and an infinite supply of\nsweetmeats, French preserved foods, sherbets, wines, and so on. I put a\nnumber of things into a pannier, went up again, found some of those\nexquisite pale cigarettes which drunken in the hollow of an emerald,\nalso a jewelled two-yard-long chibouque, and tembaki: and with all\ndescended by another stair, and laid them on the steps of a little\nraised kiosk of green marble in a corner of the court; went up again,\nand brought down a still-snowy _yatag_ to sleep on; and there, by the\nkiosk-step, ate and passed the night, smoking for several hours in a\nstate of languor. In the centre of the court is a square marble well,\nlooking white through a rankness of wild vine, acacias in flower, weeds,\njasmines, and roses, which overgrew it, as well as the kiosk and the\nwhole court, climbing even the four-square arcade of Moorish arches\nround the open space, under one of which I had deposited a long lantern\nof crimson silk: for here no breath of the fire had come. About two in\nmorning I fell to sleep, a deeper peace of shadow now reigning where so\nlong the melancholy silver of the moon had lingered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout eight in the morning I rose and made my way to the front,\nintending that that should be my last night in this ruined place: for\nall the night, sleeping and waking, the thing which had happened filled\nmy brain, growing from one depth of incredibility to a deeper, so that\nat last I arrived at a sort of certainty that it could be nothing but a\ndrunken dream: but as I opened my eyes afresh, the deep-cutting\nrealisation of that impossibility smote like a pang of lightning-stroke\nthrough my being: and I said: 'I will go again to the far Orient, and\nforget': and I started out from the court, not knowing what had become\nof her during the night, till, having reached the outer chamber, with a\nwild start I saw her lying there at the door in the very spot where I\nhad flung her, asleep sideways, head on arm ... Softly, softly, I stept\nover her, got out, and went running at a cautious clandestine trot. The\nmorning was in high _f\u00c3\u00aate_, most fresh and pure, and to breathe was to\nbe young, and to see such a sunlight lighten even upon ruin so vast was\nto be blithe. After running two hundred yards to one of the great broken\nbazaar-portals, I looked back to see if I was followed: but all that\nspace was desolately empty. I then walked on past the arch, on which a\ngreen oblong, once inscribed, as usual, with some text in gilt\nhieroglyphs, is still discernible; and, emerging, saw the great panorama\nof destruction, a few vast standing walls, with hollow Oriental windows\nframing deep sky beyond, and here and there a pillar, or half-minaret,\nand down within the walls of the old Seraglio still some leafless,\nbranchless trunks, and in Eyoub and Phanar leafless forests, and on the\nnorthern horizon Pera with the steep upper-half of the Iani-Chircha\nstreet still there, and on the height the European houses, and all\nbetween blackness, stones, a rolling landscape of ravine, like the hilly\npack-ice of the North if its snow were ink, and to the right Scutari,\nblack, laid low, with its vast region of tombs, and rare stumps of its\nforests, and the blithe blue sea, with the widening semicircle of\nfloating _d\u00c3\u00a9bris_, looking like brown foul scum at some points,\ncongested before the bridgeless Golden Horn: for I stood pretty high in\nthe centre of Stamboul somewhere in the region of the Suleimanieh, or of\nSultan-Selim, as I judged, with immense purviews into abstract distances\nand mirage. And to me it seemed too vast, too lonesome, and after\nadvancing a few hundred yards beyond the bazaar, I turned again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI found the girl still asleep at the house-door, and stirring her with\nmy foot, woke her. She leapt up with a start of surprise, and a\nremarkable sinuous agility, and gazed an astounded moment at me, till,\nseparating reality from dream and habit, she realised me: but\nimmediately subsided to the floor again, being in evident pain. I pulled\nher up, and made her limp after me through several halls to the inner\ncourt, and the well, where I set her upon the weedy margin, took her\nfoot in my lap, examined it, drew water, washed it, and bandaged it with\na strip torn from my caftan-hem, now and again speaking gruffly to her,\nso that she might no more follow me.\n\nAfter this, I had breakfast by the kiosk-steps, and when I was\nfinished, put a mass of truffled _foie gras_ on a plate, brushed through\nthe thicket to the well, and gave it her. She took it, but looked\nfoolish, not eating. I then, with my forefinger, put a little into her\nmouth, whereupon she set hungrily to eat it all. I also gave her some\nginger-bread, a handful of bonbons, some Krishnu wine, and some\nanisette.\n\nI then started out afresh, gruffly bidding her stay there, and left her\nsitting on the well, her hair falling down the opening, she peering\nafter me through the bushes. But I had not half reached the ogival\nbazaar-portal, when looking anxiously back, I saw that she was limping\nafter me. So that this creature tracks me in the manner of a nutshell\nfollowing about in the wake of a ship.\n\nI turned back with her to the house, for it was necessary that I should\nplan some further method of eluding her. That was five days ago, and\nhere I have stayed: for the house and court are sufficiently agreeable,\nand form a museum of real _objets d'art_. It is settled, however, that\nto-morrow I return to Imbros.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seems certain that she never wore, saw, nor knew of, clothes.\n\nI have dressed her, first sousing her thoroughly with sponge and soap\nin luke-warm rose-water in the silver cistern of the harem-bath, which\nis a circular marbled apartment with a fountain and the complicated\nceilings of these houses, and frescoes, and gilt texts of the Koran on\nthe walls, and pale rose-silk hangings. On the divan I had heaped a\nnumber of selected garments, and having shewed her how to towel herself,\nI made her step into a pair of the trousers called _shintiyan_ made of\nyellow-striped white-silk; this, by a running string, I tied loosely\nround the upper part of her hips; then, drawing up the bottoms to her\nknees, tied them there, so that their voluminous baggy folds,\noverhanging still to the ankles, have rather the look of a skirt; over\nthis I put upon her a blue-striped chiffon chemise, or quamis, reaching\na little below the hips; I then put on a short jacket or vest of scarlet\nsatin, thickly embroidered in gold and precious stones, reaching\nsomewhat below the waist, and pretty tight-fitting; and, making her lie\non the couch, I put upon her little feet little yellow baboosh-slippers,\nthen anklets, on her fingers rings, round her neck a necklace of\nsequins, finally dyeing her nails, which I cut, with henna. There\nremained her head, but with this I would have nothing to do, only\npointing to the tarboosh which I had brought, to a square kerchief, to\nsome corals, and to the fresco of a woman on the wall, which, if she\nchose, she might copy. Lastly, I pierced her ears with the silver\nneedles which they used here: and after two hours of it left her.\n\nAbout an hour afterwards I saw her in the arcade round the court, and,\nto my great surprise, she had a perfect plait down her back, and over\nher head and brows a green-silk feredjeh, or hood, precisely as in the\npicture.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHere is a question, the answer to which would be interesting to me:\nWhether or not for twenty years--or say rather twenty centuries, twenty\neternal aeons--I have been stark mad, a raving maniac; and whether or\nnot I am now suddenly sane, sitting here writing in my right mind, my\nwhole mood and tone changed, or rapidly changing? And whether such\nchange can be due to the presence of only one other being in the world\nwith me?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis singular being! Where she has lived--and how--is a problem to which\nnot the faintest solution is conceivable. She had, I say, never seen\nclothes: for when I began to dress her, her perplexity was unbounded;\nalso, during her twenty years, she has never seen almonds, figs, nuts,\nliqueurs, chocolate, conserves, vegetables, sugar, oil, honey,\nsweetmeats, orange-sherbet, mastic, salt, raki, tobacco, and many such\nthings: for she showed perplexity at all these, hesitation to eat them:\nbut she has known and tasted _white wine_: I could see that. Here, then,\nis a mystery.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have not gone to Imbros, but remained here some days longer observing\nher.\n\nI have allowed her to sit in a corner at meal-time, not far from where I\neat, and I have given her food.\n\nShe is wonderfully clever! I continually find that, after an incredibly\nshort time, she has most completely adapted herself to this or that.\nAlready she wears her outfit as coquettishly as though born to clothes.\nWithout at all seeming observant--for, on the contrary, she gives an\nimpression of great flightiness--she watches me, I am convinced, with\npretty exact observation. She knows precisely when I am speaking\nroughly, bidding her go, bidding her come, tired of her, tolerant of\nher, scorning her, cursing her. If I wish her to the devil, she quickly\ndivines it by my face, and will disappear. Yesterday I noticed\nsomething queer about her, and soon discovered that she had been\nstaining her lids with black kohol, like the _hanums_, so that, having\nfound a box, she must have guessed its use from the pictures.\nWonderfully clever!--imitative as a mirror. Two mornings ago I found an\nold mother-of-pearl kittur, and sitting under the arcade, touched the\nstrings, playing a simple air; I could just see her behind one of the\narch-pillars on the opposite side, and she was listening with apparent\neagerness, and, I fancied, panting. Well, returning from a walk beyond\nthe Phanar walls in the afternoon, I heard the same air coming out from\nthe house, for she was repeating it pretty faultlessly by ear.\n\nAlso, during the forenoon of the previous day, I came upon her--for\nfootsteps make no sound in this house--in the pacha's visitors'-hall:\nand what was she doing?--copying the poses of three dancing-girls\nfrescoed there! So that she would seem to have a character as light as a\nbutterfly's, and is afraid of nothing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow I know.\n\nI had observed that at the beginning of every meal she seemed to have\nsomething on her mind, going toward the door, hesitating as if to see\nwhether I would follow, and then returning. At length yesterday, after\nsitting to eat, she jumped up, and to my infinite surprise, said her\nfirst word: said it with a most quaint, experimental effort of the\ntongue, as a fledgling trying the air: the word '_Come_.'\n\nThat morning, meeting her in the court, I had told her to repeat some\nwords after me: but she had made no attempt, as if shy to break the long\nsilence of her life; and now I felt some sort of foolish pleasure in\nhearing her utter that word, often no doubt heard from me: and after\nhurriedly eating, I went with her, saying to myself: 'She must be about\nto shew me the food to which she is accustomed: and perhaps that will\nsolve her origin.'\n\nAnd so it has proved. I have now discovered that to the moment when she\nsaw me, she had tasted only her mother's milk, dates, and that white\nwine of Ismidt which the Koran permits.\n\nAs it was getting dark, I lit and took with me the big red-silk lantern,\nand we set out, she leading, and walking confoundedly fast, slackening\nwhen I swore at her, and getting fast again: and she walks with a\ncertain levity, flightiness, and liberated _furore_, very hard to\ndescribe, as though space were a luxury to be revelled in. By what\ninstinctive cleverness, or native vigour of memory, she found her way I\ncannot tell, but she led me such a walk that night, miles, miles, till I\nbecame furious, darkness having soon fallen with only a faint moon\nobscured by cloud, and a drizzle which haunted the air, she without\nlight climbing and picking her thinly-slippered steps over mounds of\n_d\u00c3\u00a9bris_ and loosely-strewn masonry with unfailing agility, I\noccasionally splashing a foot with horror into one of those little ponds\nwhich always marked the Stamboul streets. When I was nearer her, I would\nsee her peer across and upward toward Pera, as if that were a remembered\nland-mark, and would note the perpetual aspen oscillations of the long\ncoral drops in her ears, and the nimble ply of her limbs, wondering with\na groan if Pera was our goal.\n\nOur goal was even beyond Pera. When we came to the Golden Horn, she\npointed to my caique which lay at the Old Seraglio steps, and over the\nwater we went, she lying quite at ease now, with her face at the level\nof the water in the centre of the crescent-shape, as familiarly as a\n_hanum_ of old engaged in some escapade through the crowded Babel of\nGalata and that north side of the Horn.\n\nThrough Galata we passed, I already cursing the journey: and, following\nthe line of the coast and the great steep thoroughfare of Pera, we came\nat last, almost in the country, to a great wall, and the entrance to an\nimmense terraced garden, whose limits were invisible, many of the trees\nand avenues being still intact.\n\nI knew it at once: I had lain a special fuse-train in the great palace\nat the top of the terraces: it was the royal palace, Yildiz.\n\nUp and up we went through the grounds, a few unburned old bodies in rags\nof uniform still discernible here and there as the lantern swung past\nthem, a musician in sky-blue, a fantassin and officer-of-the-guard in\nscarlet, forming a cross, with domestics of the palace in\nred-and-orange.\n\nThe palace itself was quite in ruins, together with all its surrounding\nbarracks, mosque, and seraglio, and, as we reached the top of the\ngrounds, presented a picture very like those which I have seen of the\nruins of Persepolis, only that here the columns, both standing and\nfallen, were innumerable, and all more or less blackened; and through\ndoorless doors we passed, down immensely-wide short flights of steps,\nand up them, and over strewed courtyards, by tottering fragments of\narcades, all roofless, and tracts of charcoal between interrupted\navenues of pillars, I following, expectant, and she very eager now.\nFinally, down a flight of twelve or fourteen rather steep and narrow\nsteps, very dislocated, we went to a level which, I thought, must be the\nfloor of the palace vaults: for at the bottom of the steps we stood on a\nlarge plain floor of plaster, which bore the marks of the flames; and\nover this the girl ran a few steps, pointed with excited recognition to\na hole in it, ran further, and disappeared down the hole.\n\nWhen I followed, and lowered the lantern a little, I saw that the drop\ndown was about eight feet, made less than six feet by a heap of\nstone-rubbish below, the falling of which had caused the hole: and it\nwas by standing on this rubbish-heap, I knew at once, that she must have\nbeen enabled to climb out into the world.\n\nI dropped down, and found myself in a low flat-roofed cellar, with a\nfloor of black earth, very fusty and damp, but so very vast in extent\nthat even in the day-time, I suppose, I could not have discerned its\nboundaries; I fancy, indeed, that it extends beneath the whole palace\nand its environs--an enormous stretch of space: with the lantern I could\nonly see a very limited portion of its area. She still led me eagerly\non, and I presently came upon a whole region of flat boxes, each about\ntwo feet square, and nine inches high, made of very thin laths, packed\nto the roof; and about a-hundred-and-fifty feet from these I saw, where\nshe pointed, another region of bottles, fat-bellied bottles in chemises\nof wicker-work, stretching away into gloom and total darkness. The\nboxes, of which a great number lay broken open, as they can be by merely\npulling with the fingers at a pliant crack, contain dates; and the\nbottles, of which many thousands lay empty, contain, I saw, old\nIsmidtwine. Some fifty or sixty casks, covered with mildew, some old\npieces of furniture, and a great cube of rotting, curling parchments,\nshowed that this cellar had been more or less loosely used for the\noccasional storage of superfluous stores and knick-knacks.\n\nIt was also more or less loosely used as a domestic prison. For in the\nlane between the region of boxes and the region of bottles, near the\nformer, there lay on the ground the skeleton of a woman, the details of\nwhose costume were still appreciable, with thin brass gyves on her\nwrists: and when I had examined her well, I knew the whole history of\nthe creature standing silent by my side.\n\nShe is the daughter of the Sultan, as I assumed when I had once\ndetermined that the skeleton is both the skeleton of her mother, and the\nskeleton of the Sultana.\n\nThat the skeleton was her mother is clear: for the cloud occurred just\ntwenty-one years since, and the dead woman was, of course, at that\nmoment in the prison, which must have been air-tight, and with her the\ngirl: but since the girl is quite certainly not much more than\ntwenty--she looks younger--she must at that time have been either unborn\nor a young babe: but a babe would hardly be imprisoned with another than\nits own mother. I am rather inclined to think that the girl was unborn\nat the moment of the cloud, and was born in the cellar.\n\nThat the mother was the Sultana is clear from her fragments of dress,\nand the symbolic character of her every ornament, crescent earrings,\nheron-feather, and the blue campaca enamelled in a bracelet. This poor\nwoman, I have thought, may have been the victim of some unbounded fit of\nimperial passion, incurred by some domestic crime, real or imagined,\nwhich may have been pardoned in a day had not death overtaken her master\nand the world.\n\nThere are four steep stone steps at about the centre of the cellar,\nleading up to a locked iron trap-door, apparently the only opening into\nthis great hole: and this trap-door must have been so nearly air-tight\nas to bar the intrusion of the poison in anything like deadly quantity.\n\nBut how rare--how strange--the coincidence of chances here. For, if the\ntrap-door was absolutely air-tight, I cannot think that the supply of\noxygen in the cellar, large as it was, would have been sufficient to\nlast the girl twenty years, to say nothing of what her mother used up\nbefore death: for I imagine that the woman must have continued to live\nsome time in her dungeon, sufficiently long, at least, to teach her\nchild to procure its food of dates and wine; so that the door must have\nbeen only just sufficiently hermetic to bar the poison, yet admit some\noxygen; or else, the place may have been absolutely air-tight at the\ntime of the cloud, and some crack, which I have not seen, opened to\nadmit oxygen after the poison was dispersed: in any case--the\nall-but-infinite rarity of the chance!\n\nThinking these things I climbed out, and we walked to Pera, where I\nslept in a great white-stone house in five or six acres of garden\noverlooking the cemetery of Kassim, having pointed out to the girl\nanother house in which to sleep.\n\nThis girl! what a history! After existing twenty years in a sunless\nworld hardly three acres wide, she one day suddenly saw the only sky\nwhich she knew collapse at one point! a hole appeared into yet a world\nbeyond! It was I who had come, and kindled Constantinople, and set her\nfree.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAh, I see something now! I see! it was for this that I was preserved: I\nto be a sort of new-fangled Adam--and this little creature to be my Eve!\nThat is it! _The White_ does not admit defeat: he would recommence the\nRace again! At the last, the eleventh hour--in spite of all--he would\nturn defeat into victory, and outwit that Other.\n\nHowever, if this be so--and I seem to see it quite clearly--then in that\nWhite scheme is a singular flaw: at _one point_, it is obvious, that\nelaborate Forethought fails: for I have a free will--and I refuse, I\nrefuse.\n\nCertainly, in this matter I am on the side of the Black: and since it\ndepends absolutely upon me, this time Black wins.\n\nNo more men on the earth after me, ye Powers! To _you_ the question may\nbe nothing more than a gambling excitement as to the final outcome of\nyour a\u00c3\u00abrial squabble: but to the poor men who had to bear the wrongs,\nInquisitions, rack-rents, Waterloos, unspeakable horrors, it was hard\nearnest, you know! Oh the wretchedness--the deep, deep pain--of that\nbungling ant-hill, happily wiped out, my God! My sweetheart Clodagh ...\nshe was not an ideal being! There was a man called Judas who betrayed\nthe gentle Founder of the Christian Faith, and there was some Roman king\nnamed Galba, a horrid dog, and there was a French devil, Gilles de Raiz:\nand the rest were all much the same, much the same. Oh no, it was not a\ngood race, that small infantry which called itself Man: and here,\nfalling on my knees before God and Satan as I write, I swear, I swear:\nNever through me shall it spring and fester again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI cannot realise her! Not at all, at all, at all! If she is out of my\nsight and hearing ten minutes, I fall to doubting her reality. If I lose\nher for half a day, all the old feelings, resembling certainties, come\nback, that I have only been dreaming--that this appearance cannot be an\nactual objective fact of life, since the impossible is impossible.\n\nSeventeen long years, seventeen long years, of madness....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo-morrow I start for Imbros: and whether this girl chooses to follow\nme, or whether she stays behind, I will see her from the moment I land\nno more.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe must rise very early. I who am now regularly on the palace-roof at\ndawn, sometimes from between the pavilion-curtains of the galleries, or\nfrom the steps of the telescope-kiosk, may spy her far down below, a\ndainty microscopic figure, generally running about the sward, or gazing\nup in wonder at the palace from the lake-edge.\n\nIt is now three months since she came with me to Imbros.\n\nI left her the first night in that pale-yellow house with the two green\njalousies facing the beach, where there was everything that she would\nneed; but I knew that, like all the houses there now, it leaked\nprofusely, and the next day I went down to the curving stair, cut\nthrough the rock at the back and south of the village, climbed, and half\na mile beyond found that park and villa with gables, which I had noted\nfrom the sea. The villa is almost intact, very strongly built of\npurplish marble, though small, and very like a Western house, with\nshingles, and three gables, so that I think it must have been the yali\nof some Englishman, for it contains a number of English books, though\nthe only body I saw there was what looked like an Aararat Kurd, with\nspiral string wound down his turban, yellow ankle-pantaloons, and flung\nred shoulder-cloak; and all in the heavily-wooded park, and all about\nthe low rock-steps up the hill, profusions of man-dragora; and from the\nrock-steps to the house a narrow long avenue of acacias, mossy\nunderfoot, that mingle overhead, the house standing about four yards\nfrom the edge of the perpendicular sea-cliff, whence one can see the\n_Speranzas_ main top-mast, and broken mizzen-mast-head, in her quiet\nhaven. After examining the place I went down again to the village, and\nher house: but she was not there: and two hours long I paced about among\nthe weeds of these amateur little alleys and flat-roofed windowless\nhouses (though some have terrace-roofs, and a rare aperture), whose\nonce-raw yellows, greens, and blues look now like sunset tints when the\nlast flush is gone, and they fade dun. When at last she came running\nwith open mouth, I took her up the rock-steps, and into the house, and\nthere she has lived, one of the gable-tips, I now find (that overlooking\nthe sea), being just visible from the north-east corner of the\npalace-roof, two miles from it.\n\nThat night again, when I was leaving her, she made an attempt to follow\nme. But I was resolved to end it, then: and cutting a sassafras-whip I\ncut her deep, three times, till she ran, crying.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo, then, what is my fate henceforth?--to think always, from sun to\nmoon, and from moon to sun, of one only thing--and that thing an object\nfor the microscope?--to become a sneaking Paul Pry to spy upon the silly\nmovements of one little sparrow, like some fatuous motiveless gossip of\nold, his occupation to peep, his one faculty to scent, his honey and his\nachievement to unearth the infinitely unimportant? I would kill her\nfirst!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI am convinced that she is no stay-at-home, but roams continually over\nthe island: for thrice, wandering myself, I have come upon her.\n\nThe first time she was running with flushed face, intent upon striking\ndown a butterfly with a twig held in the left hand (for both hands she\nuses with dexterity). It was at about nine in the morning, in her park,\nnear the bottom where there are high grass-growths and ferny luxuriance\nbetween the close tree-trunks, and shadow, and the broken wall of an old\nfuneral-kiosk sunk aslant under moss, creepers, and wild flowers, behind\nwhich I peeped hidden and wet with dew. She has had the assurance to\nmodify the dress I put upon her, and was herself a butterfly, for\ninstead of the shintiyan, she had on a zouave, hardly reaching to the\nwaist, of saffron satin, no feredj\u00c3\u00a9, but a scarlet fez with violet\ntassel, and baggy pantaloons of azure silk; down her back the long\nauburn plait, quite neat, but all her front hair loose and wanton, the\nfez cocked backward, while I caught glimpses of her fugitive heels\nlifting out of the dropping slipper-sole. She is pretty clever, but not\nclever enough, for that butterfly escaped, and in one instant I saw her\nchange into weary and sad, for on this earth is nothing more fickle than\nthat Proteus face, which resembles a landscape swept with cloud-shadows\non a bright day. Fast beat my heart that morning, owing to the\nconsciousness that, while I saw, I was unseen, yet might be seen.\n\nAnother noontide, three weeks afterwards, I came upon her a good way up\nyonder to the west of the palace, sleeping on her arm in an alley\nbetween overgrown old trellises, where rioting wild vine buried her in\ngloom: but I had not been peeping through the bushes a minute, when she\nstarted up and looked wildly about, her quick consciousness, I imagine,\ndetecting a presence: though I think that I managed to get away unseen.\nShe keeps her face very dirty: all about her mouth was dry-stained with\na polychrome of grape, _m\u00c3\u00bbrs_, and other coloured juices, like\nslobbering _gamins_ of old. I could also see that her nose and cheeks\nare now sprinkled with little freckles.\n\nFour days since I saw her a third time, and then found that the\nprimitive instinct to represent the world in pictures has been working\nin her: for she was drawing. It was down in the middle one of the three\neast-and-west village streets, for thither I had strolled toward\nevening, and coming out upon the street from between an old wall and a\nhouse, saw her quite near. I pulled up short--and peered. She was lying\non her face all among grasses, a piece of yellow board before her, and\nin her fingers a chalk-splinter: and very intently she drew, her\ntongue-tip travelling along her short upper-lip from side to side,\nregularly as a pendulum, her fez tipped far back, and the left foot\nswinging upward from the knee. She had drawn her yali at the top, and\nnow, as I could see by peering well forward, was drawing underneath the\npalace--from memory, for where she lay it is all hidden: yet the palace\nit was, for there were the waving lines meant for the steps, the two\nslanting pillars, the slanting battlements of the outer court, and\nbefore the portal, with turban reaching above the roof, and my two\nwhisks of beard sweeping below the knees--myself.\n\nSomething spurred me, and I could not resist shouting a sudden \"Hi!\"\nwhereupon she scrambled like a spring-bok to her feet, I pointing to the\ndrawing, smiling.\n\nThis creature has a way of mincing her pressed lips, while she shakes\nthe head, intensely cooing a fond laugh: and so she did then.\n\n\"You are a clever little wretch, you know,\" said I, she cocking her eye,\ntrying to divine my meaning with vague smile.\n\n'Oh, yes, a clever little wretch,' I went on in a gruff voice, 'clever\nas a serpent, no doubt: for in the first case it was the Black who used\nthe serpent, but now it is the White. But it will not do, you know. Do\nyou know what you are to me, you? You are my Eve!--a little fool, a\nlittle piebald frog like you. But it will not do at all, at all! A nice\nrace it would be with you for mother, and me for father, wouldn't\nit?--half-criminal like the father, half-idiot like the mother: just\nlike the last, in short. They used to say, in fact, that the offspring\nof a brother and sister was always weak-headed: and from such a wedlock\ncertainly came the human race, so no wonder it was what it was: and so\nit would have to be again now. Well no--unless we have the children, and\ncut their throats at birth: and _you_ would not like that at all, I\nknow, and, on the whole, it would not work, for the White would be\nstriking a poor man dead with His lightning, if I attempted that. No,\nthen: the modern Adam is some eight to twenty thousand years wiser than\nthe first--you see? less instinctive, more rational. The first disobeyed\nby commission: I shall disobey by omission: only his disobedience was a\nsin, mine is a heroism. I have not been a particularly ideal sort of\nbeast so far, you know: but in me, Adam Jeffson--I swear it--the human\nrace shall at last attain a true nobility, the nobility of\nself-extinction. I shall turn out trumps: I shall prove myself stronger\nthan Tendency, World-Genius, Providence, Currents of Fate, White Power,\nBlack Power, or whatever is the name for it. No more Clodaghs, Lucrezia\nBorgias, Semiramises, Pompadours, Irish Landlords, Hundred-Years'\nWars--you see?'\n\nShe kept her left eye obliquely cocked like a little fool, wondering, no\ndoubt, what I was saying.\n\n'And talking of Clodagh,' I went on, 'I shall call you that henceforth,\nto keep me reminded. So that is your name--not Eve--but Clodagh, who was\na Poisoner, you see? She poisoned a poor man who trusted her: and that\nis your name now--not Eve, but Clodagh--to remind me, you most dangerous\nlittle speckled viper! And in order that I may no more see your foolish\nlittle pretty face, I decree that, for the future, you wear a _yashmak_\nto cover up your lips, which, I can see, were meant to be seductive,\nthough dirty; and you can leave the blue eyes, and the little\nwhite-skinned freckled nose uncovered, if you like, they being\ncommonplace enough. Meantime, if you care to see how to draw a palace--I\nwill show you.'\n\nBefore I stretched my hand, she was presenting the board--so that she\nhad guessed something of my meaning! But some hard tone in my talk had\nwounded her, for she presented it looking very glum, her under-lip\npushing a little obliquely out, very pathetically, I must say, as always\nwhen she is just ready to cry.\n\nIn a few strokes I drew the palace, and herself standing at the portal\nbetween the pillars: and now great was her satisfaction, for she pointed\nto the sketched figure, and to herself, interrogatively: and when I\nnodded 'yes,' she went cooing her fond murmurous laugh, with pressed\nand mincing lips: and it is clear that, in spite of my beatings, she is\nin no way afraid of me.\n\nBefore I could move away, I felt some rain-drops, and down in some\nseconds rushed a shower. I looked, saw that the sky was rapidly\ndarkening, and ran into the nearest of the little cubical houses,\nleaving her glancing sideways upward, with the quaintest artlessness of\ninterest in the downpour: for she is not yet quite familiarised with the\noperations of nature, and seems to regard them with a certain amiable\ninquisitive seriousness, as though they were living beings, comrades as\ngood as herself. She presently joined me, but even then stretched her\nhand out to feel the drops.\n\nNow there came a thunder-clap, the wind was rising, and rain spattering\nabout me: for the panes of these houses, made, I believe, of paper\nsaturated in almond-oil, have long disappeared, and rains, penetrating\nby roof and rare window, splash the bones of men. I gathered up my\nskirts to run toward other shelter, but she was before me, saying in her\nstrange experimental voice that word of hers: \"_Come_.\"\n\nShe ran in advance, and I, with the outer robe over my head, followed,\nurging flinching way against the whipped rain-wash. She took the way by\nthe stone horse-pond, through an alley to the left between two blind\nwalls, then down a steep path through wood to the rock-steps, and up we\nran, and along the hill, to her yali, which is a mile nearer the village\nthan the palace, though by the time we pelted into its dry shelter we\nwere wet to the skin.\n\nSudden darkness had come, but she quickly found some matches, lit one,\nlooking at it with a certain meditative air, and applied it to a candle\nand to a bronze Western lamp on the table, which I had taught her to oil\nand light. Near a Western fire-place was a Turkish mangal, like one\nwhich she had seen me light to warm bath-waters in Constantinople, and\nwhen I pointed to it, she ran to the kitchen, returned with some chopped\nwood, and very cleverly lit it. And there for several hours I sat that\nnight, reading (the first time for many years): it was a book by the\npoet Milton, found in a glazed book-case on the other side of the\nfire-place: and most strange, most novel, I found those august words\nabout warring angels that night, while the storm raved: for this man had\nevidently taken no end of pains with his book, and done it gallantly\nwell, too, making the thing hum: and I could not conceive why he should\nhave been at that trouble--unless it were for the same reason that I\nbuilt the palace, because some spark bites a man, and he would be\nlike--but that is all vanity, and delusion.\n\nWell, there is a rage in the storms of late years which really\ntranscends bounds; I do not remember if I have noted it in these sheets\nbefore: but I never could have conceived a turbulence so huge. Hour\nafter hour I sat there that night, smoking a chibouque, reading, and\nlistening to the batteries and lamentations of that haunted air,\nshrinking from it, fearing even for the _Speranza_ by her quay in the\nsequestered harbour, and for the palace-pillars. But what astonished me\nwas that girl: for, after sitting on the ottoman to my left some time,\nshe fell sideways asleep, not the least fear about her, though I should\nhave thought that nervousness at such a turmoil would be so natural to\nher: and whence she has this light confidence in the world into which\nshe has so abruptly come I do not know, for it is as though someone\ninspired her with the mood of nonchalance, saying: 'Be of good cheer,\nand care not a pin about anything: for God is God.'\n\nI heard the ocean swing hoarse like heavy ordnance against the cliffs\nbelow, where they meet the outer surface of the southern of the two\nclaws of land that form the harbour: and the thought came into my mind:\n'If now I taught her to speak, to read, I could sometimes make her read\na book to me.'\n\nThe winds seemed wilfully struggling for the house to snatch and wing it\naway into the drear Eternities of the night: and I could not but heave\nthe sigh: 'Alas for us two poor waifs and castaways of our race, little\nbits of flotsam and seaweed-hair cast up here a moment, ah me, on this\nshore of the Ages, soon to be dragged back, O turgid Eternity, into thy\nabysmal gorge; and upon what strand--who shall say?--shall she next be\nflung, and I, divided then perhaps by all the stretch of the\ntrillion-distanced astral gulf?' And such a pity, and a wringing of the\nheart, seemed in things, that a tear fell from my eyes that ominous\nmidnight.\n\nShe started up at a gust of more appalling volume, rubbing her eyes,\nwith dishevelled hair (it must have been about midnight), listening a\nminute, with that demure, droll interest of hers, to the noise of the\nelements, and then smiled to me; rose then, left the room, and presently\nreturned with a pomegranate and some almonds on a plate, also some\ndelicious old sweet wine in a Samian cruche, and an old silver cup, gilt\ninside, standing in a zarf. These she placed on the table near me, I\nmurmuring: 'Hospitality.'\n\nShe looked at the book, which I read as I ate, with lowered left\neye-lid, seeking to guess its use, I suppose. Most things she\nunderstands at once, but this must have baffled her: for to see one\nlooking fixedly at a thing, and not know what one is looking at it for,\nmust be very disconcerting.\n\nI held it up before her, saying:\n\n\"Shall I teach you to read it? If I did, how would you repay me, you\nClodagh?\"\n\nShe cocked her eyes, seeking to comprehend. God knows, at that moment I\npitied the poor dumb waif, alone in all the whole round earth with me.\nThe candle-flame, moved by the wind like a slow-painting brush,\nflickered upon her face, though every cranny was closed.\n\n\"Perhaps, then,\" I said, \"I will teach you. You are a pitiable little\nderelict of your race, you know: and two hours every day I will let you\ncome to the palace, and I will teach you. But be sure, be careful. If\nthere be danger, I will kill you: assuredly--without fail. And let me\nbegin with a lesson now: say after me: 'White.'\"\n\nI took her hand, and got her to understand that I wanted her to repeat\nafter me.\n\n\"White,\" said I.\n\n\"Hwhite,\" said she.\n\n'Power,' said I.\n\n'Pow-wer,' said she.\n\n'White Power,' said I.\n\n'Hwhite Pow-wer,' said she.\n\n'Shall not,' said I.\n\n'Sall not,' said she.\n\n'White Power shall not,' said I.\n\n'Hwhite Pow-wer sall not,' said she.\n\n'Prevail,' said I.\n\n'Fffail,' said she, pronouncing the 'v' with a long fluttering\n'f'-sound.\n\n'Pre-vail,' said I.\n\n'Pe-vvvail,' said she.\n\n'White Power shall not prevail,' said I.\n\n'Hwhite Pow-wer sall not--fffail,' said she.\n\nA thunder which roared as she said it seemed to me to go laughing\nthrough the universe, and a minute I looked upon her face with positive\nshrinking fear; till, starting up, I thrust her with violence from my\npath, and dashed forth to re-seek the palace and my bed.\n\nSuch was the ingratitude and fatality which my first attempt, four\nnights since, to teach her met with. It remains to be seen whether my\npity for her dumbness, or some servile tendency toward fellowship in\nmyself, will result in any further lesson. Certainly, I think not: for\nthough I have given my word, the most solemnly-pledged word may be\nbroken.\n\nSurely, surely, her presence in the world with me--for I suppose it is\nthat--has wrought some profound changes in my mood: for gone now\napparently are those turbulent hours when, stalking like a peacock, I\nflaunted my monarchy in the face of the Eternal Powers, with hissed\nblasphemies; or else dribbled, shaking my body in a lewd dance; or was\noff to fire some vast city and revel in redness and the chucklings of\nHell; or rolled in the drunkenness of drugs. It was mere frenzy!--I see\nit now--it was 'not good,' 'not good.' And it rather looks as if it were\npast--or almost. I have clipped my beard and hair, removed the earrings,\nand thought of modifying my attire. I will just watch to see whether she\ncomes loitering down there about the gate of the lake.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer progress is like....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is nine months since I have written, on these sheets, those words,\n'Her progress is like....' being the beginning of some narrative in\nwhich something interrupted me: and since then I have had no impulse to\nwrite.\n\nBut I was thinking just now of the curious tricks and uncertainties of\nmy memory, and seeing the sheets, will record it here. I have lately\nbeen trying to recall the name of a sister of mine--some perfectly\nsimple name, I know--and the name of my old home in England: and they\nhave completely passed out of my cognizance, though she was my only\nsister, and we grew up closely together: some quite simple name, I\nforget it now. Yet I can't say that my memory is bad: there are\nthings--quite unexpected, unimportant things--which come up in my mind\nwith considerable clearness. For instance, I remember to have met in\nParis (I think), long before the poison-cloud, a little Brazilian boy of\nthe colour of weak coffee-and-milk, of whom she now constantly reminds\nme. He wore his hair short like a convict's, so that one could spy the\nfish-white flesh beneath, and delighted to play solitary about the\nstairs of the hotel, dressed up in the white balloon-dress of a Pierrot.\nI have the impression now that he must have had very large ears. Clever\nas a flea he was, knowing five or six languages, as it were by nature,\nwithout having any suspicion that that was at all extraordinary. She has\nthat same light, unconscious, and nonchalant cleverness, and easy way of\nlife. It is little more than a year since I began to teach her, and\nalready she can speak English with a quite considerable vocabulary, and\nperfect correctness (except that she does not pronounce the letter 'r');\nshe has also read, or rather devoured, a good many books; and can write,\ndraw, and play the harp. And all she does without effort: rather with\nthe flighty naturalness with which a bird takes to the wing.\n\nWhat made me teach her to read was this: One afternoon, fourteen months\nor so ago, I from the roof-kiosk saw her down at the lake-rim, a book in\nhand; and as she had seen me looking steadily at books, so she was\nlooking steadily at it, with pathetic sideward head: so that I burst\ninto laughter, for I saw her clearly through the glass, and whether she\nis the simplest little fool, or the craftiest serpent that ever\nbreathed, I am not yet sure. If I thought that she has the least design\nupon my honour, it would be ill for her.\n\nI went to Gallipoli for two days in the month of May, and brought back a\nvery pretty little caique, a perfect slender crescent of the colour of\nthe moon, though I had two days' labour in cutting through bush-thicket\nfor the passage of the motor in bringing it up to the lake. It has\npleased me to see her lie among the silk cushions of the middle, while\nI, paddling, taught her her first words and sentences between the hours\nof eight and ten in the evening, though later they became 10 A.M. to\nnoon, when the reading began, we sitting on the palace-steps before the\nportal, her mouth invariably well covered with the yashmak, the\nlesson-book being a large-lettered old Bible found at her yali. _Why_\nshe must needs wear the yashmak she has never once asked; and how much\nshe divines, knows, or intends, I have no idea, continually questioning\nmyself as to whether she is all simplicity, or all cunning.\n\nThat she is conscious of some profound difference in our organisation I\ncannot doubt: for that I have a long beard, and she none at all, is\namong the most patent of facts.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have thought that a certain _Western-ness_--a growing modernity of\ntone--may be the result, as far as I am concerned, of her presence with\nme? I do not know....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere is the gleam of a lake-end just visible in the north forest from\nthe palace-top, and in it a good number of fish like carp, tench, roach,\netc., so in May I searched for a tackle-shop in the Gallipoli\nFatmeh-bazaar, and got four 12-foot rods, with reels, silk-line,\nquill-floats, a few yards of silk-worm gut, with a packet of No. 7 and\n8 hooks, and split-shot for sinkers; and since red-worms, maggots and\ngentles are common on the island, I felt sure of a great many more fish\nthan the number I wanted, which was none at all. However, for the mere\namusement, I fished several times, lying at my length in a patch of\nlong-grass over-waved by an enormous cedar, where the bank is steep, and\nthe water deep. And one mid-afternoon she was suddenly there with me,\nquestioned me with her eyes, and when I consented, stayed: and presently\nI said I would teach her bottom-angling, and sent her flying up to the\npalace for another rod and tackle.\n\nThat day she did nothing, for after teaching her to thread the worm, and\nput the gentles on the smaller hooks, I sent her to hunt for worms to\nchop up for ground-baiting the pitch for the next afternoon; and when\nthis was done it was dinner-time, and I sent her home, for by then I was\ngiving the reading-lessons in the morning.\n\nThe next day I found her at the bank, taught her to take the sounding\nfor adjusting the float, and she lay down not far from me, holding the\nrod. So I said to her:\n\n'Well, this is better than living in a dark cellar twenty years, with\nnothing to do but walk up and down, sleep, and consume dates and Ismidt\nwine.'\n\n'Yes!' says she.\n\n'Twenty years!' said I: 'How did you bear it?'\n\n'I was not closs,' says she.\n\n'Did you never suspect that there was a world outside that cellar?' said\nI.\n\n'Never,' says she, 'or lather, yes: but I did not suppose that it was\n_this_ world, but another where he lived.'\n\n'He who?'\n\n'He who spoke with me.'\n\n'Who was that?'\n\n'Oh! a bite!' she screamed gladly.\n\nI saw her float bob under, and started up, rushed to her, and taught her\nhow to strike and play it, though it turned out when landed to be\nnothing but a tiny barbel: but she was in ecstasies, holding it on her\npalm, murmuring her fond coo.\n\nShe re-baited, and we lay again. I said:\n\n'But what a life: no exit, no light, no prospect, no hope--'\n\n'Plenty of _hope_!' says she.\n\n'Good Heavens! hope of what?'\n\n'I knew vely well that something was lipening over the cellar, or under,\nor alound it, and would come to pass at a certain fixed hour, and that I\nshould see it, and feel it, and it would be vely nice.'\n\n'Ah, well, you had to wait for it, at any rate. Didn't those twenty\nyears seem _long_?'\n\n'No--at least sometimes--not often. I was always so occupied.'\n\n'Occupied in doing what?'\n\n'In eating, or dlinking, or lunning, or talking.'\n\n'Talking to your_self_?'\n\n'Not myself.'\n\n'To whom, then?'\n\n'To the one who told me when I was hungly, and put the dates to satisfy\nmy hunger.'\n\n'I see. Don't wriggle about in that way, or you will never catch any\nfish. The maxim of angling is: \"Study to be quiet\"--'\n\n'O! another bite!' she called, and this time, all alone, very agilely\nlanded a good-sized bream.\n\n'But do you mean that you were never sad?' said I when she was\nre-settled.\n\n'Sometimes I would sit and cly,' says she--'I did not know why. But if\nthat was \"sadness,\" I was never miserlable, never, never. And if I\nclied, it did not last long, and I would soon fall to sleep, for he\nwould lock me in his lap, and kiss me, and wipe all my tears away.'\n\n'He who?'\n\n'Why, what a question! he who told me when I was hungly, and of the\nthing that was lipening outside the cellar, which would be so nice.'\n\n'I see, I see. But in all that dingy place, and thick gloom, were you\nnever at all afraid?'\n\n'Aflaid! _I_! of what?'\n\n'Of the unknown.'\n\n'I do not understand you. How could I be _aflaid_? The known was the\nvery opposite of tellible: it was merely hunger and dates, thirst and\nwine, the desire to lun and space to lun in, the desire to sleep and\nsleep: there was nothing tellible in that: and the unknown was even less\ntellible than the known: for it was the nice thing that was lipening\noutside the cellar. I do not understand--'\n\n'Ah, yes,' said I, 'you are a clever little being: but your continual\nfluttering about is fatal to all angling. Isn't it in your nature to\nkeep still a minute? And with regard now to your habits in the\ncellar--?'\n\n'_Another!_' she cried with happy laugh, and landed a young chub. And\nthat afternoon she caught seven, and I none.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother day I took her from the pitch to one of the kitchens in the\nvillage with some of the fish, till then always thrown away, and taught\nher cooking: for the only cooking-implement in the palace is the silver\nalcohol-lamp for coffee and chocolate. We both scrubbed the utensils,\nand boil and fry I taught her, and the making of a sauce from vinegar,\nbottled olives, and the tinned American butter from the _Speranza_, and\nthe boiling of rice mixed with flour for ground-baiting our pitch. And\nshe, at first astonished, was soon all deft housewifeliness, breathless\nofficiousness, and behind my back, of her own intuitiveness, grated some\ndry almonds found there, and with them sprinkled the fried tench. And we\nate them, sitting on the floor together: the first new food, I suppose,\ntasted by me for twenty-one years: nor did I find it disagreeable.\n\nThe next day she came up to the palace reading a book, which turned out\nto be a cookery-book in English, found at her yali; and a week later,\nshe appeared, out of hours, presenting me a yellow-earthenware dish\ncontaining a mess of gorgeous colours--a boiled fish under red peppers,\nbits of saffron, a greenish sauce, and almonds: but I turned her away,\nand would have none of her, or her dish.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout a mile up to the west of the palace is a very old ruin in the\ndeepest forest, I think of a mosque, though only three truncated\ninternal pillars under ivy, and the weedy floor, with the courtyard and\nportal-steps remain, before it being a long avenue of cedars, gently\ndescending from the steps, the path between the trees choked with\nlong-grass and wild rye reaching to my middle. Here I saw one day a\nlarge disc of old brass, bossed in the middle, which may have been\neither a shield or part of an ancient cymbal, with concentric rings\ngraven round it, from centre to circumference. The next day I brought\nsome nails, a hammer, a saw, and a box of paints from the _Speranza_;\nand I painted the rings in different colours, cut down a slim\nlime-trunk, nailed the thin disc along its top, and planted it well,\nbefore the steps: for I said I would make a bull's-eye, and do rifle and\nrevolver practice before it, from the avenue. And this the next evening\nI was doing at four hundred feet, startling the island, it seemed, with\nthat unusual noise, when up she came peering with enquiring face: at\nwhich I was very angry, because my arm, long unused, was firing wide:\nbut I was too proud to say anything, and let her look, and soon she\nunderstood, laughing every time I made a considerable miss, till at last\nI turned upon her saying: 'If you think it so easy, you may try.'\n\nShe had been wanting to try, for she came eagerly to the offer, and\nafter I had opened and showed her the mechanism, the cartridges, and how\nto shoot, I put into her hands one of the _Speranza_ Colt's. She took\nher bottom-lip between her teeth, shut her left eye, vaulted out the\nrevolver like an old shot to the level of her intense right eye, and\nsent a ball through the geometrical centre of the boss.\n\nHowever, it was a fluke-shot, for I had the satisfaction of seeing her\nmiss every one of the other five, except the last, which hit the black.\nThat, however, was three weeks since, and now my hitting record is forty\nper cent., and hers ninety-six--most extraordinary: so that it is clear\nthat this creature is the _prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9e_ of someone, and favouritism is in\nthe world.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer book of books is the Old Testament. Sometimes, at noon or afternoon,\nI may look abroad from the roof or galleries, and see a remote figure\nsitting on the sward under the shade of plane or black cypress: and I\nalways know that the book she cons there is the Bible--like an old\nRabbi. She has a passion for stories: and there finds a store.\n\nThree nights since when it was pretty late, and the moon very splendid,\nI saw her passing homewards close to the lake, and shouted down to her,\nmeaning to say 'Good-night'; but she thought that I had called her, and\ncame: and sitting out on the top step we talked for hours, she without\nthe yashmak.\n\nWe fell to talking about the Bible. And says she: 'What did Cain to\nAbel?'\n\n'He knocked him over,' I replied, liking sometimes to use such idioms,\nwith the double object of teaching and perplexing her.\n\n'Over what?' says she.\n\n'Over his heels,' said I.\n\n'I do not complehend!'\n\n'He killed him, then.'\n\n'That I know. But how did Abel feel when he was killed? What is it to be\n_killed_?'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'you have seen bones all around you, and the bones of\nyour mother, and you can feel the bones in your fingers. Your fingers\nwill become mere bone after you are dead, as die you must. Those bones\nwhich you see around you, are, of course, the bones of the men of whom\nwe often speak: and the same thing happened to them which happens to a\nfish or a butterfly when you catch them, and they lie all still.'\n\n'And the men and the butterfly feel the same after they are dead?'\n\n'Precisely the same. They lie in a deep drowse, and dream a\nnonsense-dream.'\n\n'That is not dleadful. I thought that it was much more dleadful. I\nshould not mind dying.'\n\n'Ah!... so much the better: for it is possible that you may have to die\na great deal sooner than you think.'\n\n'I should not mind. Why were men so vely aflaid to die?'\n\n'Because they were all such shocking cowards.'\n\n'Oh, not all! not all!'\n\n(This girl, I know not with what motive, has now definitely set herself\nup against me as the defender of the dead race. With every chance she is\nat it.)\n\n'Nearly all,' said I: 'tell me one who was not afraid--'\n\n'There was Isaac,' says she: 'when Ablaham laid him on the wood to kill\nhim, he did not jump up and lun to hide.'\n\n'Isaac was a great exception,' said I: 'in the Bible and such books, you\nunderstand, you read of only the best sorts of people; but there were\nmillions and millions of others--especially about the time of the\npoison-cloud--on a very much lower level--putrid wretches--covetous,\nfalse, murderous, mean, selfish, debased, hideous, diseased, making the\nearth a very charnel of festering vices and crimes.'\n\nThis, for several minutes, she did not answer, sitting with her back\nhalf toward me, cracking almonds, continually striking one step with the\nball of her outstretched foot. In the clarid gold of the platform I saw\nher fez and corals reflected as an elongated blotch of florid red. She\nturned and drank some wine from the great gold Jarvan goblet which I had\nbrought from the temple of Boro Budor, her head quite covered in by it.\nThen, the little hairs at her lip-corners still wet, says she:\n\n'Vices and climes, climes and vices. Always the same. What were these\nclimes and vices?'\n\n'Robberies of a hundred sorts, murders of ten hundred--'\n\n'But what made them _do_ them?'\n\n'Their evil nature--their base souls.'\n\n'But _you_ are one of them, _I_ am another: yet you and I live here\ntogether, and we do no vices and climes.'\n\nHer astounding shrewdness! Right into the inmost heart of a matter does\nher simple wit seem to pierce!\n\n'No,' I said, 'we do no vices and crimes, because we lack _motive_.\nThere is no danger that we should hate each other, for we have plenty to\neat and drink, dates, wines, and thousands of things. (Our danger is\nrather the other way.) But _they_ hated and schemed, because they were\nvery numerous, and there arose a question among them of dates and wine.'\n\n'Was there not, then, enough land to grow dates and wine for all?'\n\n'There was--yes: much more than enough, I fancy. But some got hold of a\nvast lot of it, and as the rest felt the pinch of scarcity, there arose,\nnaturally, a pretty state of things--including the vices and crimes.'\n\n'Ah, but then,' says she, 'it was not to their bad souls that the vices\nand climes were due, but only to this question of land. It is certain\nthat if there had been no such question, there would have been no vices\nand climes, because you and I, who are just like them, do no vices and\nclimes here, where there is no such question.'\n\nThe clear limelight of her intelligence! She wriggled on her seat in her\neffort of argument.\n\n'I am not going to argue the matter,' I said. 'There _was_ that question\nof dates and wine, you see. And there always must be on an earth where\nmillions of men, with varying degrees of cunning, reside.'\n\n'Oh, not at all necessalily!' she cries with conviction: 'not at all, at\nall: since there are much more dates and wine than are enough for all.\nIf there should spling up more men now, having the whole wisdom,\nscience, and expelience of the past at their hand, and they made an\nallangement among themselves that the first man who tlied to take more\nthan he could work for should be killed, and sent to dleam a\nnonsense-dleam, the question could never again alise!'\n\n'It arose before--it would arise again.'\n\n'But no! I can guess clearly how it alose before: it alose thlough the\nsheer carelessness of the first men. The land was at first so vely, vely\nmuch more than enough for all, that the men did not take the tlouble to\nmake an allangement among themselves; and afterwards the habit of\ncarelessness was confirmed; till at last the vely oliginal carelessness\nmust have got to have the look of an allangement; and so the stleam\nwhich began in a little long ended in a big long, the long glowing more\nand more fixed and fatal as the stleam lolled further flom the source. I\nsee it clearly, can't you? But now, if some more men would spling, they\nwould be taught--'\n\n'Ah, but no more men will _spling_, you see--!'\n\n'There is no telling. I sometimes feel as if they must, and shall. The\ntlees blossom, the thunder lolls, the air makes me lun and leap, the\nglound is full of lichness, and I hear the voice of the Lord God walking\nall among the tlees of the folests.'\n\nAs she said this, I saw her under-lip push out and tremble, as when she\nis near to crying, and her eyes moisten: but a moment after she looked\nat me full, and smiled, so mobile is her face: and as she looked, it\nsuddenly struck me what a noble temple of a brow the creature has,\nalmost pointed at the uplifted summit, and widening down like a\nbell-curved Gothic arch, draped in strings of frizzy hair which anon she\nshakes backward with her head.\n\n'Clodagh,' I said after some minutes--'do you know why I called you\nClodagh?'\n\n'No? Tell me?'\n\n'Because once, long ago before the poison-cloud, I had a lover called\nClodagh: and she was a....'\n\n'But tell me first,' cries she: 'how did one know one's lover, or one's\nwife, flom all the others?'\n\n'Well, by their faces....'\n\n'But there must have been many faces--all alike--'\n\n'Not all alike. Each was different from the rest.'\n\n'Still, it must have been vely clever to tell. I can hardly conceive\nany face, except yours and mine.'\n\n'Ah, because you are a little goose, you see.'\n\n'What was a goose like?'\n\n'It was a thing like a butterfly, only larger, and it kept its toes\nalways spread out, with a skin stretched between.'\n\n'Leally? How caplicious! And am I like that?--but what were you saying\nthat your lover, Clodagh, was?'\n\n'She was a Poisoner.'\n\n'Then why call me Clodagh, since _I_ am not a poisoner?'\n\n'I call you so to remind me: lest you--lest you--should become\nmy--lover, too.'\n\n'I am your lover already: for I love you.'\n\n'What, girl?'\n\n'Do I not love you, who are mine?'\n\n'Come, come, don't be a little maniac!' I went. 'Clodagh was a\n_poisoner_....'\n\n'Why did she poison? Had she not enough dates and wine?'\n\n'She had, yes: but she wanted more, more, more, the silly idiot.'\n\n'So that the vices and climes were not confined to those that lacked\nthings, but were done by the others, too?'\n\n'By the others chiefly.'\n\n'Then I see how it was!'\n\n'How was it?'\n\n'The others had got _spoiled_. The vices and climes must have\nbegun with those who lacked things, and then the others, always seeing\nvices and climes alound them, began to do them, too--as when one rotten\nolive is in a bottle, the whole mass soon becomes collupted: but\noriginally they were not rotten, but only became so. And all though a\nlittle carelessness at the first. I am sure that if more men could\nspling now--'\n\n'But I _told_ you, didn't I, that no more men will spring? You\nunderstand, Clodagh, that originally the earth produced men by a long\nprocess, beginning with a very low type of creature, and continually\ndeveloping it, until at last a man stood up. But that can never happen\nagain: for the earth is old, old, and has lost her producing vigour now.\nSo talk no more of men _splinging_, and of things which you do not\nunderstand. Instead, go inside--stop, I will tell you a secret: to-day\nin the wood I picked some musk-roses and wound them into a wreath,\nmeaning to give them you for your head when you came to-morrow: and it\nis inside on the pearl tripod in the second room to the left: go,\ntherefore, and put it on, and bring the harp, and play to me, my dear.'\n\nShe ran quick with a little cry, and coming again, sat crowned,\nincarnadine in the blushing depths of the gold. Nor did I send her home\nto her lonely yali, till the pale and languished moon, weary of\nall-night beatitudes, sank down soft-couched in quilts of curdling opals\nto the Hesperian realms of her rest.\n\nSo sometimes we speak together, she and I, she and I.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat ever I should write such a thing! I am driven out from Imbros!\n\nI was walking up in a wood yesterday to the west--it was a calm clear\nevening about seven, the sun having just set. I had the book in which I\nhave written so far in my hand, for I had thought of making a sketch of\nan old windmill to the north-west to show her. Twenty minutes before she\nhad been with me, for I had chanced to meet her, and she had come, but\nkept darting on ahead after peeping fruit, gathering armfuls of\namaranth, nenuphar, and red-berried asphodel, till, weary of my life, I\nhad called to her: 'Go away! out of my sight'--and she, with suddenly\npushed under-lip, had walked off.\n\nWell, I was continuing my stroll, when I seemed to feel some quaking of\nthe ground, and before one could count twenty, it was as if the island\nwas bent upon wracking itself to pieces. My first thought was of her,\nand in great scare I went running, calling in the direction which she\nhad gone, staggering as on the deck of some labouring ship, falling,\npicking myself up, running again. The air was quite full of uproar, and\nthe land waving like the sea: and as I went plunging, not knowing\nwhither, I saw to my right some three or four acres of forest droop and\nsink into a gulf which opened to receive them. Up I flung my arms,\ncrying out: 'Good God! save the girl!' and a minute later rushed out, to\nmy surprise, into open space on a hill-side. On the lower ground I could\nsee the palace, and beyond it, a small space of white sea which had the\nawful appearance of being higher than the land. Down the hill-side I\nstaggered, driven by the impulse to fly somewhither, but about half way\ndown was startled afresh by a shrill pattering like musical hail, and\nthe next moment saw the entire palace rush with the jangling clatter of\na thousand bells into the heaving lake.\n\nSome seconds after this, the earthquake, having lasted fully ten\nminutes, began to lull, and soon ceased. I found her an hour later\nstanding among the ruins of her little yali.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, what a thing! Probably every building on the island has been\ndestroyed; the palace-platform, all cracked, leans half-sunken askew\ninto the lake, like a huge stranded ark, while of the palace itself no\ntrace remains, except a mound of gold stones emerging above the lake to\nthe south. Gone, gone--sixteen years of vanity and vexation. But from a\npractical point of view, what is a worst calamity of all is that the\n_Speranza_ now lies high-and-dry in the village: for she was bodily\npicked up from the quay by the tidal wave, and driven bow-foremost into\na street not half her width, and there now lies, looking huge enough in\nthe little village, wedged for ever, smashed in at the nip like a frail\nmatch-box, a most astonishing spectacle: her bows forty feet up the\nstreet, ten feet above the ground at the stem, rudder resting on the\ninner edge of the quay, foremast tilted forward, the other two masts all\nright, and that bottom, which has passed through seas so far, buried in\nevery sort of green and brown seaweed, the old _Speranza_. Her steps\nwere there, and by a slight leap I could catch them underneath and go up\nhand-over-hand, till I got foothold; this I did at ten the same night\nwhen the sea-water had mostly drained back from the land, leaving\neverything very swampy, however; she there with me, and soon following\nme upon the ship. I found most things cracked into tiny fragments,\ntwisted, disfigured out of likeness, the house-walls themselves\ndisplaced a little at the nip, the bow of the cedar skiff smashed in to\nher middle against the aft starboard corner of the galley; and were it\nnot for the fact that the air-pinnace had not broken from her heavy\nropings, and one of the compasses still whole, I do not know what I\nshould have done: for the four old water-logged boats in the cove have\nutterly disappeared.\n\nI made her sleep on the cabin-floor amid the _d\u00c3\u00a9bris_ of berth and\neverything, and I myself slept high up in the wood to the west. I am\nwriting now lying in the long-grass the morning after, the sun rising,\nthough I cannot see him. My plan for to-day is to cut three or four logs\nwith the saw, lay them on the ground by the ship, lower the pinnace upon\nthem, so get her gradually down into the water, and by evening bid a\nlong farewell to Imbros, which drives me out in this way. Still, I look\nforward with pleasure to our hour's run to the Mainland, when I shall\nteach her to steer by the compass, and manipulate liquid-air, as I have\ntaught her to dress, to talk, to cook, to write, to think, to live. For\nshe is my creation, this creature: as it were, a 'rib from my side.'\n\nBut what is the design of this expulsion? And what was it that she\ncalled it last night?--'this new going out flom Halan'! 'Haran,' I\nbelieve, being the place from which Abraham went out, when 'called' by\nGod.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe apparently felt only the tail of the earthquake at Imbros: for it has\nravaged Turkey! And we two poor helpless creatures put down here in the\ntheatre of all these infinite violences: it is too bad, too bad. For the\nrages of Nature at present are perfectly astonishing, and what it may\ncome to I do not know. When we came to the Macedonian coast in good\nmoonlight, we sailed along it, and up the Dardanelles, looking out for\nvillage, yali, or any habitation where we might put up: but everything\nhas apparently been wrecked. We saw Kilid-Bahr, Chanak-Kaleh, Gallipoli,\nLapsaki in ruins; at the last place I landed, leaving her in the boat,\nand walked a little way, but soon went back with the news that there was\nnot even a bazaar-arch left standing whole, in most parts even the line\nof the streets being obliterated, for the place had fallen like a house\nof dice, and had then been shaken up and jumbled. Finally we slept in a\nforest on the other side of the strait, beyond Gallipoli, taking our few\nprovisions, and having to wade at some points through morass a foot deep\nbefore we reached dry woodland.\n\nHere, the next morning, I sat alone--for we had slept separated by at\nleast half a mile--thinking out the question of whither I should go: my\nchoice would have been to remain either in the region where I was, or to\ngo Eastward: but the region where I was offered no dwelling that I could\nsee; and to go any distance Eastward, I needed a ship. Of ships I had\nseen during the night only wrecks, nor did I know where to find one in\nall these latitudes. I was thus, like her 'Ablaham,' urged Westward.\n\nIn order, then, to go Westward, I first went a little further Eastward,\nonce more entered the Golden Horn, and once more mounted the scorched\nSeraglio steps. Here what the wickedness of man had spared, the\nwickedness of Nature had destroyed, and the few houses which I had left\nstanding round the upper part of Pera I now saw low as the rest; also\nthe house near the Suleimanieh, where we had lived our first days, to\nwhich I went as to a home, I found without a pillar standing; and that\nnight she slept under the half-roof of a little funeral-kiosk in the\nscorched cypress-wood of Eyoub, and I a mile away, at the edge of the\nforest where first I saw her.\n\nThe next morning, having met, as agreed, at the site of the Prophet's\nmosque, we traversed together the valley and cemetery of Kassim by the\nquagmires up to Pera, all the landscape having to me a rather twisted\nunfamiliar aspect. We had determined to spend the morning in searching\nfor supplies among the earthquake-ruins of Pera; and as I had decided to\ncollect sufficient in one day to save us further pains for some time, we\npassed a good many hours in this task, I confining myself to the great\nwhite house in the park overlooking Kassim, where I had once slept,\nlosing myself in the huge obliquities of its floors, roofs and\nwall-fragments, she going to the old Mussulman quarter of Djianghir\nnear, on the heights of Taxim, where were many shops, and thence round\nthe brow of the hill to the great French Embassy-house, overlooking\nFoundoucli and the sea, both of us having large Persian carpet-bags, and\nall in the air of that wilderness of ruin that morning a sweet, strong,\npermanent odour of maple-blossom.\n\nWe met toward evening, she quivering under such a load, that I would not\nlet her carry it, but abandoned my day's labour, which was lighter, and\ntook hers, which was quite enough: we went back Westward, seeking all\nthe while some shelter from the saturating night-dews of this place: and\nnothing could we find, till we came again, quite late, to her broken\nfuneral-kiosk at the entrance to the immense cemetery-avenue of Eyoub.\nThere without a word I left her among the shattered catafalques, for I\nwas weary; but having gone some distance, turned back, thinking that I\nmight take some more raisins from the bag; and after getting them, said\nto her, shaking her little hand where she sat under the roof-shadow on a\nstone:\n\n'Good-night, Clodagh.'\n\nShe did not answer promptly: and her answer, to my surprise, was a\nprotest against her name: for a rather sulky, yet gentle, voice came\nfrom the darkness, saying:\n\n'I am _not_ a Poisoner!'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'all right: tell me whatever you like that I should call\nyou, and henceforth I will call you that.'\n\n'Call me Eve,' says she.\n\n'Well, no,' said I, 'not Eve, anything but that: for _my_ name is Adam,\nand if I called you Eve, that would be simply absurd, and we do not want\nto be ridiculous in each other's eyes. But I will call you anything else\nthat you like.'\n\n'Call me Leda,' says she.\n\n'And why Leda?' said I.\n\n'Because Leda sounds something like Clodagh,' says she, 'and you are\nal-leady in the habit of calling me Clodagh; and I saw the name Leda in\na book, and liked it: but Clodagh is most hollible, most bitterly\nhollible!'\n\n'Well, then,' said I, 'Leda it shall be, and I shan't forget, for I like\nit, too, and it suits you, and you ought to have a name beginning with\nan \"L.\" Good-night, my dear, sleep well, and dream, dream.'\n\n'And to you, too, my God give dleams of peace and pleasantness,' says\nshe; and I went.\n\nAnd it was only when I had lain myself upon leaves for my bed, my head\non my caftan, a rill for my lullaby, and two stars, which alone I could\nsee out of the heavenful, for my watch-lights; and only when my eyes\nwere already closed toward slumber, that a sudden strong thought pierced\nand woke me: for I remembered that Leda was the name of a Greek woman\nwho had borne twins. In fact, I should not be surprised if this Greek\nword Leda is the same word etymologically as the Hebrew Eve, for I have\nheard of _v's_, and _b's_, and _d's_ interchanging about in this way,\nand if _Di_, meaning God, or Light, and _Bi_, meaning Life, and Io_v_e,\nand Iho_v_ah and Go_d_, meaning much the same, are all one, that would\nbe nothing astonishing to me, as wi_d_ow, and veu_v_e, are one: and\nwhere it says, 'truly the Light is Good (_tob, b_on),' this is as if it\nsaid, 'truly the Di is Di.' Such, at any rate, is the fatality that\nattends me, even in the smallest things: for this Western Eve, or Greek\nLeda, had twins.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, the next morning we crossed by the ruins of old Greek Phanar\nacross the triple Stamboul-wall, which still showed its deep-ivied\nportal, and made our way, not without climbing, along the Golden Horn to\nthe foot of the Old Seraglio, where I soon found signs of the railway.\nAnd that minute commenced our journey across Turkey, Bulgaria, Servia,\nBosnia, Croatia, to Trieste, occupying no day or two as in old times,\nbut four months, a long-drawn nightmare, though a nightmare of rich\nhappiness, if one may say so, leaving on the memory a vague vast\nimpression of monstrous ravines, ever-succeeding profundities, heights\nand greatnesses, jungles strange as some moon-struck poet's fantasy,\neverlasting glooms, and a sound of mighty unseen rivers, cataracts, and\nslow cumbered rills whose bulrushes never see the sun, with largesse\neverywhere, secrecies, profusions, the unimaginable, the unspeakable, a\nsavagery most lush and fierce and gaudy, and vales of Arcadie, and\nremote mountain-peaks, and tarns shy as old-buried treasure, and\nglaciers, and we two human folk pretty small and drowned and lost in\nall that amplitude, yet moving always through it.\n\nWe followed the lines that first day till we came to a steam train, and\nI found the engine fairly good, and everything necessary to move it at\nmy hand: but the metals in such a condition of twisted, broken, vaulted,\nand buried confusion, due to the earthquake, that, having run some\nhundreds of yards to examine them, I saw that nothing could be done in\nthat way. At first this threw me into a condition like despair, for what\nwe were to do I did not know: but after persevering on foot for four\ndays along the deep-rusted track, which is of that large-gauge type\npeculiar to Eastern Europe, I began to see that there were considerable\nsound stretches, and took heart.\n\nI had with me land-charts and compass, but nothing for taking\naltitude-observations: for the _Speranza_ instruments, except one\ncompass, had all been broken-up by her shock. However, on getting to the\ntown of Silivri, about thirty miles from our start, I saw in the ruins\nof a half-standing bazaar-shop a number of brass objects, and there\nfound several good sextants, quadrants, and theodolites. Two mornings\nlater, we came upon an engine in mid-country, with coals in it, and a\nstream near; I had a goat-skin of almond-oil in the bag, and found the\nmachinery serviceable after an hour's careful inspection, having\nexamined the boiler with a candle through the manhole, and removed the\nautoclaves of the heaters. All was red with rust, and the shaft of the\nconnecting-rod in particular seemed so frail, that at one moment I was\nvery dubious: I decided, however, and, except for a slight leakage at\nthe tubulure which led the steam to the valve-chest, all went very well;\nat a pressure never exceeding three-and-a-half atmospheres, we travelled\nnearly a hundred and twenty miles before being stopped by a head-to-head\nblock on the line, when we had to abandon our engine; we then continued\nanother seven miles a-foot, I all the time mourning my motor, which I\nhad had to leave at Imbros, and hoping at every townlet to find a whole\none, but in vain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was wonderful to see the villages and towns going back to the earth,\nalready invaded by vegetation, and hardly any longer breaking the\ncontinuity of pure Nature, the town now as much the country as the\ncountry, and that which is not-Man becoming all in all with a certain\n_furore_ of vigour. A whole day in the southern gorges of the Balkan\nMountains the slow train went tearing its way through many a mile of\nbind-weed tendrils, a continuous curtain, flaming with large flowers,\nbut sombre as the falling shades of night, rather resembling jungles of\nCeylon and the Filipinas; and she, that day, lying in the single car\nbehind, where I had made her a little yatag-bed from Tatar Bazardjik,\ncontinually played the kittur, barely touching the strings, and crooning\nlow, low, in her rich contralto, eternally the same air, over and over\nagain, crooning, crooning, some melancholy tune of her own dreaming,\njust audible to me through the slow-travailing monotony of the engine;\ntill I was drunken with so sweet a woe, my God, a woe that was sweet as\nlife, and a dolour that lulled like nepenthe, and a grief that soothed\nlike kisses, so sweet, so sweet, that all that world of wood and gloom\nlost locality and realness for me, and became nothing but a charmed and\npensive Heaven for her to moan and lullaby in; and from between my\nfingers streamed plenteous tears that day, and all that I could keep on\nmourning was 'O Leda, O Leda, O Leda,' till my heart was near to break.\n\nThe feed-pump eccentric-shaft of this engine, which was very poor and\nflaky, suddenly gave out about five in the afternoon, and I had to stop\nin a hurry, and that sweet invisible mechanism which had crooned and\ncrooned about my ears in the air, and followed me whithersoever I went,\nstopped too. Down she jumped, calling out:\n\n'Well, I had a plesentiment that something would happen, and I am so\nglad, for I was tired!'\n\nSeeing that nothing could be done with the feed-water pump, I got down,\ntook the bag, and parting before us the continuous screen, we went\npioneering to the left between a rock-cleft, stepping over large stones\nthat looked black with moss-growths, no sky, but hundreds of feet of\nimpenetrable leafage overhead, and everywhere the dew-dabbled profusion\nof dim ferneries, dishevelled maidenhairs mixed with a large-leaved\nmimosa, wild vine, white briony, and a smell of cedar, and a soft\nrushing of perpetual waters that charmed the gloaming. The way led\nslightly upwards three hundred feet, and presently, after some windings,\nand the climbing of five huge steps almost regular, yet obviously\nnatural, the gorge opened in a roundish space, fifty feet across, with\nfar overhanging edges seven hundred feet high; and there, behind a\ncurtain which fell from above, its tendrils defined and straight like a\nJapanese bead-hanging, we spread the store of foods, I opening the\nwines, fruits, vegetables and meats, she arranging them in order with\nthe gold plate, and lighting both the spirit-lamp and the lantern: for\nhere it was quite dark. Near us behind the curtain of tendrils was a\nsmall green cave in the rock, and at its mouth a pool two yards wide, a\nblack and limpid water that leisurely wheeled, discharging a little\nrivulet from the cave: and in it I saw three owl-eyed fish, a finger\nlong, loiter, and spur themselves, and gaze. Leda, who cannot be still\nin tongue or limb, chattered in her glib baby manner as we ate, and\nthen, after smoking a cigarette, said that she would go and 'lun,' and\nwent, and left me darkling, for she is the sun and the moon and the host\nof the stars, I occupying myself that night in making a calendar at the\nend of this book in which I have written, for my almanack and many\nthings that I prized were lost with the palace--making a calendar,\ncounting the days in my head--but counting them across my thoughts of\nher.\n\nShe came again to tell me good-night, and then went down to the train to\nsleep; and I put out the lantern, and stooped within the cave, and made\nmy simple couch beside the little rivulet, and slept.\n\nBut a fitful sleep, and soon again I woke; and a long time I lay so,\ngradually becoming conscious of a slow dripping at one spot in the\ncave: for at a minute's interval it darkly splashed, regularly, very\ndeliberately; and it seemed to grow always louder and sadder, and the\nsplash at first was 'Leesha,' but it became 'Leda' to my ears, and it\nsobbed her name, and I pitied myself, so sad was I. And when I could no\nlonger bear the anguished melancholy of its spasm and its sobbing, I\narose and went softly, softly, lest she should hear in that sounding\nsilence of the hushed and darksome night, going more slow, more soft, as\nI went nearer, a sob in my throat, my feet leading me to her, till I\ntouched the carriage. And against it a long time I leant my clammy brow,\na sob aching in my poor throat, and she all mixed up in my head with the\nsuspended hushed night, and with the elfin things in the air that made\nthe silence so musically a-sound to the vacant ear-drum, and with the\ndripping splash in the cave. And softly I turned the door-handle, and\nheard her breathe in Asleep, her head near me; and I touched her hair\nwith my lips, and close to her ear I said--for I heard her breathe as if\nin sleep--'Little Leda, I have come to you, for I could not help it,\nLeda: and oh, my heart is full of the love of you, for you are mine, and\nI am yours: and to live with you, till we die, and after we are dead to\nbe near you still, Leda, with my broken heart near your heart, little\nLeda--'\n\nI must have sobbed, I think; for as I spoke close at her ears, with\npassionately dying eyes of love, I was startled by an irregularity in\nher breathing; and with cautious hurry I shut the door, and quite back\nto the cave I stole in haste.\n\nAnd the next morning when we met I thought--but am not now sure--that\nshe smiled singularly: I thought so. She may, she _may_, have heard--But\nI cannot tell.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwice I was obliged to abandon engines on account of forest-tree\nobstructions right across the line, which, do what I might, I could not\nmove, and these were the two bitterest incidents of the pilgrimage; and\nat least thirty times I changed from engine to engine, when other trains\nblocked. As for the extent of the earthquake, it is pretty certain that\nit was universal over the Peninsula, and at many points exhibited\nextreme violence, for up to the time that we entered upon Servian\nterritory, we occasionally came upon stretches of the lines so\ndislocated, that it was impossible to proceed upon them, and during the\nwhole course I never saw one intact house or castle; four times, where\nthe way was of a nature to permit of it, I left the imbedded metals and\nmade the engine travel the ground till I came upon other metals, when I\nalways succeeded in driving it upon them. It was all very leisurely, for\nnot everywhere, nor every day, could I get a nautical observation, and\nhaving at all times to go at low pressures for fear of tube and boiler\nweakness, crawling through tunnels, and stopping when total darkness\ncame on, we did not go fast, nor much cared to. Once, moreover, for\nthree days, and once for four, we were overtaken by hurricanes of such\nvast inclemency, that no thought of travelling entered our heads, our\nonly care being to hide our poor cowering bodies as deeply and darkly as\npossible. Once I passed through a city (Adrianople) doubly devastated,\nonce by the hellish arson of my own hand, and once by the earthquake:\nand I made haste to leave that place behind me.\n\nFinally, three months and twenty-seven days from the date of the\nearthquake, having traversed only 900 odd English miles, I let go in the\nVenice lagoon, in the early morning of the 10th September, the lateen\nsail and stone anchor of a Maltese _speronare_, which I had found, and\npartially cleaned, at Trieste; and thence I passed up the Canalazzo in a\ngondola. For I said to Leda: 'In Venice will I pitch my Patriarch tent.'\n\nBut to will and to do are not the same thing, and still further\nWestward was I driven. For the stagnant upper canals of this place are\nnow mere miasmas of pestilence: and within two days I was rolling with\nfever in the Old Procurazie Palace, she standing in pale wonderment at\nmy bed-side, sickness quite a novel thing to her: and, indeed, this was\nmy first serious illness since my twentieth year or thereabouts, when I\nhad over-worked my brain, and went a voyage to Constantinople. I could\nnot move from bed for some weeks, but happily did not lose my senses,\nand she brought me the whole pharmacopoeia from the shops, from which to\nchoose my medicines. I guessed the cause of this illness, though not a\nsign of it came near her, and as soon as my trembling knees could bear\nme, I again set out--always Westward--enjoying now a certain luxury in\ntravelling compared with that Turkish difficulty, for here were no\ntwisted metals, more and better engines, in the cities as many good\npetrol motors as I chose, and Nature markedly less savage.\n\nI do not know why I did not stop at Verona or Brescia, or some other\nneighbourhood of the Italian lakes, since I was fond of water: but I\nhad, I think, the thought in my head to return to Vauclaire in France,\nwhere I had lived, and there live: for I thought that she might like\nthose old monks. At all events, we did not remain long in any place till\nwe came to Turin, where we spent nine days, she in the house opposite\nmine, and after that, at her own suggestion, went on still, passing by\ntrain into the valley of the Is\u00c3\u00a8re, and then into that of the Western\nRhone, till we came to the old town of Geneva among some very great\nmountains peaked with snow, the town seated at the head of a long lake\nwhich the earth has made in the shape of the crescent moon, and like the\nmoon it is a thing of much beauty and many moods, suggesting a creature\nunder the spell of charms and magics. However, with this idea of\nVauclaire still in my head, we left Geneva in the motor which had\nbrought us at four in the afternoon of the 17th May, I intending to\nreach the town called Bourg that night about eight, and there sleep, so\nto go on to Lyons the next morning by train, and so, by the Bordeaux\nroute, make Vauclaire. But by some chance for which I cannot to this\nhour account (unless the rain was the cause), I missed the chart-road,\nwhich should have been fairly level, and found myself on mountain\ntracks, unconscious of my whereabouts, while darkness fell, and a\nwindless downpour that had a certain sullen venom in its superabundance\ndrenched us. I stopped several times, looking about for ch\u00c3\u00a2teau,\nchalet, or village, but none did I see, though I twice came upon railway\nlines; and not till midnight did we run down a rather steep pass upon\nthe shore of a lake, which, from its apparent vastness in the moonless\nobscurity, I could only suppose to be the Lake of Geneva once again.\nAbout two hundred yards to the left we saw through the rain a large\npile, apparently risen straight out of the lake, looking ghostly livid,\nfor it was of white stone, not high, but an old thing of complicated\nwhite little turrets roofed with dark red candle extinguishers, and\noddities of Gothic nooks, window slits, and outline, very like a\nfanciful picture. Round to this we went, drowned as rats, Leda sighing\nand bedraggled, and found a narrow spit of low land projecting into the\nlake, where we left the car, walked forward with the bag, crossed a\nsmall wooden drawbridge, and came upon a rocky island with a number of\nthick-foliaged trees about the castle. We quickly found a small open\nportal, and went throughout the place, quite gay at the shelter,\neverywhere lighting candles which we found in iron sconces in the rather\nqueer apartments: so that, as the castle is far seen from the shores of\nthe lake, it would have appeared to one looking thence a place suddenly\npossessed and haunted. We found beds, and slept: and the next day it\nturned out to be the antique Castle of Chillon, where we remained five\nlong and happy months, till again, again, Fate overtook us.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe morning after our coming, we had breakfast--our last meal\ntogether--on the first floor in a pentagonal room approached from a\nlower level by three little steps. In it is a ponderous oak table\npierced with a multitude of worm eaten tunnels, also three mighty high\nbacked chairs, an old oak desk covered still with papers, arras on the\nwalls, and three dark religious oil paintings, and a grandfathers clock:\nit is at about the middle of the ch\u00c3\u00a2teau, and contains two small, but\ndeep, three faced oriels, in each face four compartments with white\nstone shafts between, these looking south upon shrubs and the rocky edge\nof the island, then upon the deep blue lake, then upon another tiny\nisland containing four trees in a jungle of flowers, then upon the shore\nof the lake interrupted by the mouths of a river which turned out to be\nthe Rhone, then upon a white town on the slopes which turned out to be\nVilleneuve, then upon the great mountains back of Bouveret and St.\nGingolph, all having the surprised air of a resurrection just\ncompleted, everything new washed in dyes of azure, ultramarine, indigo,\nsnow, emerald, that fresh morning: so that one had to call it the best\nand holiest place in the world. These five old room walls, and oak\nfloor, and two oriels, became specially mine, though it was really\ncommon ground to us both, and there I would do many little things. The\npapers on the desk told that it had been the _bureau_ of one R.E. Gaud,\n'_Grand Bailli_,' whose residence the place no doubt had been.\n\nShe asked me while eating that morning to stay here, and I said that I\nwould see, though with misgiving: so together we went all about the\nhouse, and finding it unexpectedly spacious, I consented to stop. At\nboth ends are suites, mostly small rooms, infinitely quaint and cosy,\nfurnished with heavy Henri Quatre furniture and bed draperies; and there\nare separate, and as it were secret, spiral stairs for exit to each: so\nwe decided that she should have the suite overlooking the length of the\nlake, the mouths of the Rhone, Bouveret and Villeneuve; and I should\nhave that overlooking the spit of land behind and the little drawbridge,\nshore cliffs, and elmwood which comes down to the shore, giving at one\npoint a glimpse of the diminutive hamlet of Chillon; and, that decided,\nI took her hand in mine, and I said:\n\n'Well, then, here we stay, both under the same roof--for the first time.\nLeda, I will not explain why to you, but it is dangerous, so much so\nthat it _may_ mean the death of one or other of us: deadly, deadly\ndangerous, my poor girl. You do not understand, but that is the fact,\nbelieve me, for I know it very well, and I would not tell you false.\nWell, then, you will easily comprehend, that this being so, you must\nnever on any account come near my part of the house, nor will I come\nnear yours. Lately we have been very much together, but then we have\nbeen active, full of purpose and occupation: here we shall be nothing of\nthe kind, I can see. You do not understand at all--but things are so. We\nmust live perfectly separate lives, then. You are nothing to me, really,\nnor I to you, only we live on the same earth, which is nothing at all--a\nmere chance. Your own food, clothes, and everything that you want, you\nwill procure for yourself: it is perfectly easy: the shores are crowded\nwith mansions, castles, towns and villages; and I will do the same for\nmyself. The motor down there I set apart for your private use: if I want\nanother, I will get one; and to-day I will set about looking you up a\nboat and fishing tackle, and cut a cross on the bow of yours, so that\nyou may know yours, and never use mine. All this is very necessary: you\ncannot dream how much: but I know how much. Do not run any risks in\nclimbing, now, or with the motor, or in the boat ... little Leda ...'\n\nI saw her under-lip push, and I turned away in haste, for I did not care\nwhether she cried or not. In that long voyage, and in my illness at\nVenice, she had become too near and dear to me, my tender love, my dear\ndarling soul; and I said in my heart: 'I will be a decent being: I will\nturn out trumps.'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnder this castle is a sort of dungeon, not narrow, nor very dark, in\nwhich are seven stout dark-grey pillars, and an eighth, half-built into\nthe wall; and one of them which has an iron ring, as well as the ground\naround it, is all worn away by some prisoner or prisoners once chained\nthere; and in the pillar the word 'Byron' engraved. This made me\nremember that a poet of that name had written something about this\nplace, and two days afterwards I actually came upon three volumes of the\npoet in a room containing a great number of books, many of them English,\nnear the Grand Bailli's _bureau_: and in one I read the poem, which is\ncalled 'The Prisoner of Chillon.' I found it very affecting, and the\ndescription good, only I saw no seven rings, and where he speaks of the\n'pale and livid light,' he should speak rather of the dun and brownish\ngloom, for the word 'light' disconcerts the fancy, and of either pallor\nor blue there is there no sign. However, I was so struck by the horror\nof man's cruelty to man, as depicted in this poem, that I determined\nthat she should see it; went up straight to her rooms with the book,\nand, she being away, ferreted among her things to see what she was\ndoing, finding all very neat, except in one room where were a number of\nprints called _La Mode_, and _d\u00c3\u00a9bris_ of snipped cloth, and medley.\nWhen, after two hours, she came in, and I suddenly presented myself,\n'Oh!' she let slip, and then fell to cooing her laugh; and I took her\ndown through a big room stacked with every kind of rifle, with\nrevolvers, cartridges, powder, swords, bayonets--evidently some official\nor cantonal magazine--and then showed her the worn stone in the dungeon,\nthe ring, the narrow deep slits in the wall, and I told the tale of\ncruelty, while the splashing of the lake upon the rock outside was heard\nwith a strange and tragic sound, and her mobile face was all one sorrow.\n\n'How cruel they must have been!' cries she with tremulous lip, her face\nat the same time reddened with indignation.\n\n'They were mere beastly monsters,' said I: 'it is nothing surprising if\nmonsters were cruel.'\n\nAnd in the short time while I said that, she was looking up with a\nnew-born smile.\n\n'Some others came and set the plisoner flee!' cries she.\n\n'Yes,' said I, 'they did, but--'\n\n'That was good of them,' says she.\n\n'Yes,' said I, 'that was all right, so far as it went.'\n\n'And it was a time when men had al-leady become cluel,' says she: 'if\nthose who set him flee were so good when all the lest were cluel, what\nwould they have been at a time when all the lest were kind? They would\nhave been just like Angels....!'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt this place fishing, and long rambles, were the order of the day, both\nfor her and for me, especially fishing, though a week rarely passed\nwhich did not find me at Bouveret, St. Gingolph, Yvoire, Messery, Nyon,\nOuchy, Vevay, Montreux, Geneva, or one of the two dozen villages,\ntownlets, or towns, that crowd the shores, all very pretty places, each\nwith its charm, and mostly I went on foot, though the railway runs right\nround the forty odd miles of the lake's length. One noon-day I was\nwalking through the main-street of Vevay going on to the Cully-road when\nI had a fearful shock, for in a shop just in front of me to the right I\nheard a sound--an unmistakable indication of life--as of clattering\nmetals shaken together. My heart leapt into my mouth, I was conscious of\nbecoming bloodlessly pale, and on tip-toe of exquisite caution I stole\nup to the open door--peeped in--and it was she standing on the counter\nof a jeweller's shop, her back turned to me, with head bent low over a\ntray of jewels in her hands, which she was rummaging for something. I\nwent _'Hoh!'_ for I could not help it, and all that day, till sunset, we\nwere very dear friends, for I could not part from her, we walking\ntogether by vor-alpen, wood, and shore all the way to Ouchy, she just\nlike a creature crazy that day with the bliss of living, rolling in\ngrasses and perilous flowery declines, stamping her foot defiantly at\nme, arrogant queen that she is, and then running like mad for me to\ncatch her, with laughter, _abandon_, carolling railleries, and the\nlevity of the wild ass's colt on the hills, entangling her loose-flung\nhair with Bacchic tendril and blossom, and drinking, in the passage\nthrough Cully, more wine, I thought, than was good: and the flaming\ndarts of lightning that shot and shocked me that day, and the inner\nsecret gleams and revelations of Beauty which I had, and the pangs of\nwhite-hot honey that tortured my soul and body, and were too much for\nme, and made me sick, oh Heaven, what tongue could express all that deep\nworld of things? And at Ouchy with a backward wave of my arm I silently\nmotioned her from me, for I was dumb, and weak, and I left her there:\nand all that long night her power was upon me, for she is stronger than\ngravitation, which may be evaded, and than all the forces of life\ncombined, and the sun and the moon and the earth are nothing compared\nwith her; and when she was gone from me I was like a fish in the air, or\nlike a bird in the deep, for she is my element of life, made for me to\nbreathe in, and I drown without her: so that for many hours I lay on\nthat grassy hill leading to the burial-ground outside Ouchy that night,\nlike a man sore wounded, biting the grass.\n\nWhat made things worse for me was her adoption of European clothes since\ncoming to this place: I believe that, in her adroit way, she herself\nmade some of her dresses, for one day I saw in her apartments a number\nof coloured fashion-plates, with a confusion like dress-making; or she\nmay have been only modifying finished things from the shops, for her\nWestern dressing is not quite like what I remember of the modern female\nstyle, but is really, I should say, quite her own, rather resembling the\nGreek, or the eighteenth century. At any rate, the airs and graces are\nas natural to her as feathers to parrots; and she has changes like the\nmoon; never twice the same, and always transcending her last phase and\nrevelation: for I could not have conceived of anyone in whom _taste_ was\na faculty so separate as in her, so positive and salient, like smelling\nor sight--more like _smelling_: for it is the faculty, half Reason, half\nImagination, by which she fore-scents precisely what will suit\nexquisitely with what; so that every time I saw her, I received the\nimpression of a perfectly novel, completely bewitching, work of Art: the\nspecial quality of works of Art being to produce the momentary\nconviction that anything else whatever could not possibly be so good.\n\nOccasionally, from my window I would see her in the wood beyond the\ndrawbridge, cool and white in green shade, with her Bible probably,\ntraining her skirt like a court-lady, and looking much taller than\nbefore. I believe that this new dressing produced a separation between\nus more complete than it might have been; and especially after that day\nbetween Vevay and Ouchy I was very careful not to meet her. The more I\nsaw that she bejewelled herself, powdered herself, embalmed herself like\nsachets of sweet scents, chapleted her Greek-dressed head with gold\nfillets, the more I shunned her. Myself, somehow, had now resumed\nEuropean dress, and, ah me, I was greatly changed, greatly changed, God\nknows, from the portly inflated monarch-creature that strutted and\ngroaned four years previously in the palace at Imbros: so that my manner\nof life and thought might once more now have been called modern and\nWestern.\n\nAll the more was my sense of responsibility awful: and from day to day\nit seemed to intensify. An arguing Voice never ceased to remonstrate\nwithin me, nor left me peace, and the curse of unborn hosts appeared to\nmenace me. To strengthen my fixity I would often overwhelm myself, and\nher, with muttered opprobriums, calling myself 'convict,' her\n'lady-bird'; asking what manner of man was I that I should dare so great\na thing; and as for her, what was she to be the Mother of a world?--a\nversatile butterfly with a woman's brow! And continually now in my\nfiercer moods I was meditating either my death--or hers.\n\nAh, but the butterfly did not let me forget her brow! To the south-west\nof Villeneuve, between the forest and the river is a well-grown gentian\nfield, and returning from round St. Gingolph to the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau one day in\nthe third month after an absence of three days, I saw, as I turned a\ncorner in the descent of the mountain, some object floating in the air\nabove the field. Never was I more startled, and, above all, perplexed:\nfor, beside the object soaring there like a great butterfly, I could see\nnothing to account for it. It was not long, however, before I came to\nthe conclusion that she has re-invented _the kite_--for she had almost\ncertainly never seen one--and I presently sighted her holding the string\nin the midfield. Her invention resembles the kind called 'swallow-tail'\nof old.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut mostly it was on the lake that I saw her, for there we chiefly\nlived, and occasionally there were guilty approaches and _rencontres_,\nshe in her boat, I in mine, both being slight clinker-built Montreux\npleasure-boats, which I had spent some days in overhauling and\nvarnishing, mine with jib, fore-and-aft mainsail, and spanker, hers\nrather smaller, one-masted, with an easy-running lug-sail. It was no\nuncommon thing for me to sail quite to Geneva, and come back from a\nseven-days' cruise with my soul filled and consoled with the lake and\nall its many moods of bright and darksome, serene and pensive, dolorous\nand despairing and tragic, at morning, at noon, at sunset, at midnight,\na panorama that never for an instant ceased to unroll its\ntransformations, I sometimes climbing the mountains as high as the\ngoat-herd region of hoch-alpen, once sleeping there. And once I was made\nvery ill by a two-weeks' horror which I had: for she disappeared in her\nskiff, I being at the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau, and she did not come back; and while she\nwas away there was a tempest that turned the lake into an angry ocean,\nand, ah my good God, she did not come. At last, half-crazy at the vacant\ndays of misery which went by and by, and she did not come, I set out\nupon a wild-goose quest, of her--of all the hopeless things the most\nhopeless, for the world is great--and I sought and did not find her; and\nafter three days I turned back, recognising that I was mad to search the\ninfinite, and coming near the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau, I saw her wave her handkerchief\nfrom the island-edge, for she divined that I had gone to seek her, and\nshe was watching for me: and when I took her hand, what did she say to\nme, the Biblical simpleton?--'Oh you of little Faith!' says she. And she\nhad adventures to lisp, with all the _r_'s liquefied into _l_'s, and I\nwas with her all that day again.\n\nOnce a month perhaps she would knock at my outermost door, which I\nmostly kept locked when at home, bringing me a sumptuously-dressed,\nhighly-spiced red trout or grayling, which I had not the heart to\nrefuse, and exquisitely she does them, all hot and spiced, applying\napparently to their preparation the taste which she applies to dress;\nand her extraordinary luck in angling did not fail to supply her with\nthe finest specimens, though, for that matter, this lake, with its old\nfish-hatcheries and fish-ladders, is not miserly in that way, swarming\nnow with the best lake trout, river trout, red trout, and with salmon,\nof which last I have brought in one with the landing-net of, I should\nsay, thirty-five to forty pounds. As the bottom goes off very rapidly\nfrom the two islands to a depth of eight to nine hundred feet, we did\nnot long confine ourselves to bottom-fishing, but gradually advanced to\nevery variety of manoeuvre, doing middle-water spinning with\nthree-triangle flights and sliding lip-hook for jack and trout, trailing\nwith the sail for salmon, live-baiting with the float for pike, daping\nwith blue-bottles, casting with artificial flies, and I could not say in\nwhich she became the most carelessly adept, for all soon seemed as old\nand natural to her as an occupation learned from birth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the 21st October I attained my forty-sixth birthday in excellent\nhealth: a day destined to end for me in bloodshed and tragedy, alas. I\nforget now what circumstance had caused me to mention the date long\nbeforehand in, I think, Venice, not dreaming that she would keep any\ncount of it, nor was I even sure that my calendar was not faulty by a\nday. But at ten in the morning of what I called the 21st, descending by\nmy private spiral in flannels with some trout and par bait, and\ntackle--I met her coming up, my God, though she had no earthly right to\nbe there. With her cooing murmur of a laugh, yet pale, pale, and with a\nmost guilty look, she presented me a large bouquet of wild flowers.\n\nI was at once thrown into a state of great agitation. She was dressed in\nrather a frippery of _mousseline de soie_, all cream-laced, with\nwide-hanging short sleeves, a large diamond at the low open neck, the\nivory-brown skin there contrasting with the powdered bluish-white of her\nface, where, however, the freckles were not quite whited out; on her\nfeet little pink satin slippers, without any stockings--a divinely pale\npink; and well back on her hair a plain thin circlet of gold; and she\nsmelled like heaven, God knows.\n\nI could not speak. She broke an awkward silence, saying, very faint and\npallid:\n\n'It is the day!'\n\n'I--perhaps--' I said, or some incoherency like that.\n\nI saw the touch of enthusiasm which she had summoned up quenched by my\nmanner.\n\n'I have not done long again?' she asked, looking down, breaking another\nsilence.\n\n'No, no, oh no,' said I hurriedly: 'not done wrong again. Only, I could\nnot suppose that you would count up the days. You are ... considerate.\nPerhaps--but--'\n\n'Tell Leda?'\n\n'Perhaps.... I was going to say ... you might come fishing with me....'\n\n'O luck!' she went softly.\n\nI was pierced by a sense of my base cowardice, my incredible weakness:\nbut I could not at all help it.\n\nI took the flowers, and we went down to the south side, where my boat\nlay; I threw out some of the fish from the well; arranged the tackle,\nand then the stern cushions for her; got up the sails; and out we went,\nshe steering, I in the bows, with every possible inch of space between\nus, receiving delicious intermittent whiffs from her of ambergris,\nfrangipane, or some blending of perfumes, the morning being bright and\nhot, with very little breeze on the water, which looked mottled, like\ncolourless water imperfectly mixed with indigo-wash, we making little\nheadway; so it was some time before I moved nearer her to get the par\nfor fixing on the three-triangle flight, for I was going to trail for\nsalmon or large lake-trout; and during all that time we spoke not a word\ntogether.\n\nAfterwards I said:\n\n'Who told you that flowers are proper to birthdays? or that birthdays\nare of any importance?'\n\n'I suppose that nothing can happen so important as birth,' says she:\n'and perfumes must be ploper to birth, because the wise men blought\nspices to the young Jesus.'\n\nThis _na\u00c3\u00afvet\u00c3\u00a9_ was the cause of my immediate recovery: for to laugh is\nto be saved: and I laughed right out, saying:\n\n'But you read the Bible too much! all your notions are biblical. You\nshould read the quite modern books.'\n\n'I have tlied,' says she: 'but I cannot lead them long, nor often. The\nwhole world seems to have got so collupted. It makes me shudder.'\n\n'Ah, well now, you see, you quite come round to my point of view,' said\nI.\n\n'Yes, and no,' says she: 'they had got so _spoiled_, that is all.\nEverlybody seems to have become quite dull-witted--the plainest tluths\nthey could not see. I can imagine that those faculties which aided them\nin their stlain to become lich themselves, and make the lest more poor,\nmust have been gleatly sharpened, while all the other faculties\nwithered: as I can imagine a person with one eye seeing double thlough\nit, and quite blind on the other side.'\n\n'Ah,' said I, 'I do not think they even _wanted_ to see on the other\nside. There were some few tolerably good and clear-sighted ones among\nthem, you know: and these all agreed in pointing out how, by changing\none or two of their old man-in-the-moon Bedlam arrangements, they could\ngreatly better themselves: but they heard with listless ears: I don't\nknow that they ever made any considerable effort. For they had become\nmore or less unconscious of their misery, so miserable were they: like\nthe man in Byron's \"Prisoner of Chillon,\" who, when his deliverers came,\nwas quite indifferent, for he says:\n\n  \"It was at length the same to me\n  Fettered or fetterless to be:\n    I had learned to love Despair.\"'\n\n'Oh my God,' she went, covering her face a moment, 'how dleadful! And\nit is tlue, it seems tlue:--they had learned to love Despair, to be even\nploud of Despair. Yet all the time, I feel _sure_ flom what I have lead,\nflom what I scent, that the individual man was stluggling to see, to\nlive light, but without power, like one's leg when it is asleep: that is\nso pletty of them all! that they meant well--everly one. But they were\ntoo tloubled and sad, too awfully burdened: they had no chance at all.\nSuch a queer, unnatulal feeling it gives me to lead of all that world: I\ncan't desclibe it; all their motives seem so tainted, their life so\nlopsided. Tluely, the whole head was sick, and the whole heart faint.'\n\n'Quite so,' said I: 'and observe that this was no new thing: in the very\nbeginning of the Book we read how God saw that the wickedness of man was\ngreat on the earth, and every imagination of his heart evil....'\n\n'Yes,' she interrupted, 'that is tlue: but there must have been some\n_cause!_ We can be quite _sure_ that it was not natulal, because you and\nI are men, and our hearts are not evil.'\n\nThis was her great argument which she always trotted out, because she\nfound that I had usually no answer to give to it. But this time I said:\n\n'Our hearts not evil? Say yours: but as to mine you know nothing,\nLeda.'\n\nThe semicircles under her eyes had that morning, as often, a certain\nmoist, heavy, pensive and weary something, as of one fresh from a revel,\nvery sweet and tender: and, looking softly at me with it, she answered:\n\n'I know my own heart, and it is not evil: not at all: not even in the\nvery least: and I know yours, too.'\n\n'You know _mine!_' cried I, with a half-laugh of surprise.\n\n'Quite well,' says she.\n\nI was so troubled by this cool assurance, that I said not a word, but\ngoing to her, handed her the baited flight, swivel-trace, and line,\nwhich she paid out; then I got back again almost into the bows.\n\nAfter a ten-minutes I spoke again:\n\n'So this is news to me: you know all about my heart. Well, come, tell me\nwhat is in it!'\n\nNow she was silent, pretending to be busy with the trail, till she said,\nspeaking with low-bent face, and a voice that I could only just hear:\n\n'I will tell you what is in it: in it is a lebellion which you think\ngood, but is not good. If a stleam will just flow, neither tlying to\nclimb upward, nor over-flowing its banks, but lunning modestly in its\nfated channel just wherever it is led, then it will finally leach the\nsea--the mighty ocean--and lose itself in fulness.'\n\n'Ah,' said I, 'but that counsel is not new. It is what the philosophers\nused to call \"yielding to Destiny,\" and \"following Nature.\" And Destiny\nand Nature, I give you my word, often led mankind quite wrong--'\n\n'Or _seemed_ to,' says she--'for a time: as when a stleam flows north a\nlittle, and the sea is to the south: but it is bound for the sea all the\ntime, and will turn again. Destiny never could, and cannot yet, be\njudged, for it is not finished: and our lace should follow blindly\nwhither it points, sure that thlough many curves it leads the world to\nour God.'\n\n'Our God indeed!' I cried, getting very excited: 'girl! you talk\nspeciously, but falsely! whence have you these thoughts in that head of\nyours? Girl! you talk of \"our race\"! But there are only two of us left?\nAre you talking _at_ me, Leda? Do not _I_ follow Destiny?'\n\n'You?' she sighed, with down-bent face: 'ah, poor me!'\n\n'What should I do if I followed it?' said I, with a crazy curiosity.\n\nHer face hung lower, paler, in trouble: and she said:\n\n'You would come now and sit near me here. You would not be there where\nyou are. You would be always and for ever near me....'\n\nMy good God! I felt my face redden.\n\n'Oh, I could not _tell_ you...!' I cried: 'you talk the most disastrous...!\nyou lack all responsibility...! Never, never...!'\n\nHer face now was covered with her left hand, her right on the tiller:\nand bitingly she said, with a touch of venom:\n\n'I could _make_ you come--_now_, if I chose: but I will not: I will wait\nupon my God....'\n\n'_Make_ me!' I cried: 'Leda! How make me?'\n\n'I could cly before you, as I cly often and often ... in seclet ... for\nmy childlen....'\n\n'_You_ cry in secret? This is news--'\n\n'Yes, yes, I cly. Is not the burden of the world heavy upon me, too? and\nthe work I have to do _vely, vely_ gleat? And often and often I cly in\nseclet, thinking of it: and I could cly now if I chose, for you love\nyour little girl so much, that you could not lesist me one minute....'\n\nNow I saw the push and tortion and trembling of her poor little\nunder-lip, boding tears: and at once a flame was in me which was\naltogether beyond control; and crying out: 'why, my poor dear,' I found\nmyself in the act of rushing through the staggering boat to take her to\nme.\n\nMid-way, however, I was saved: a whisper, intense as lightning, arrested\nme: 'Forward is no escape, nor backward, but _sideward_ there may be a\nway!' And at a sudden impulse, before I knew what I was doing, I was in\nthe water swimming.\n\nThe smaller of the islands was two hundred yards away, and thither I\nswam, rested some minutes, and thence to the Castle. I did not once look\nbehind me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, from 11 A.M. till five in the afternoon, I thought it all out,\nlying in the damp flannels on my face on the sofa in the recess beside\nmy bed, where it was quite dark behind the tattered piece of arras: and\nwhat things I suffered that day, and what deeps I sounded, and what\nprayers I prayed, God knows. What infinitely complicated the awful\nproblem was this thought in my head: that to kill her would be far more\nmerciful to her than to leave her alone, having killed myself: and,\nHeaven knows, it was for her alone that I thought, not at all caring for\nmyself. To kill her was better: but to kill her with my own hands--that\nwas too hard to expect of a poor devil like me, a poor common son of\nAdam, after all, and never any sublime self-immolator, as two or three\nof them were. And hours I lay there with brows convulsed in an agony,\ngroaning only those words: 'To kill her! to kill her!' thinking\nsometimes that I should be merciful to myself too, and die, and let her\nlive, and not care, since, after my death, I would not see her suffer,\nfor the dead know not anything: and to expect me to kill her with my own\nhand was a little too much. Yet that one or other of us must die was\nperfectly certain, for I knew that I was just on the brink of failing in\nmy oath, and matters here had reached an obvious crisis: unless we could\nmake up our minds to part...? putting the width of the earth between\nus? That conception occurred to me: and in the turmoil of my thoughts it\nseemed a possibility. Finally, about 5 P.M., I resolved upon something:\nand first I leapt up, went down and across the house into the arsenal,\nchose a small revolver, fitted it with cartridge, took it up-stairs,\nlubricated it with lamp-oil, went down and out across the drawbridge,\nwalked two miles beyond the village, shot the revolver at a tree, found\nits action accurate, and started back. When I came to the Castle, I\nwalked along the island to the outer end, and looked up: there were her\npretty cream Valenciennes, put up by herself, waving inward before the\nlight lake-breeze at one open oriel; and I knew that she was in the\nCastle, for I felt it: and always, always, when she was within, I knew,\nfor I felt her with me; and always when she was away, I knew, I felt,\nfor the air had a dreadful drought, and a barrenness, in it. And I\nlooked up for a time to see if she would come to the window, and then I\ncalled, and she appeared. And I said to her: 'Come down here.'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJust here there is a little rock-path to the south, going down to the\nwater between rocks mixed with shrub-like little trees, three yards\nlong: a path, or a lane, one might call it, for at the lower end the\nrocks and trees reach well over a tall man's head. There she had tied my\nboat to a slender linden-trunk: and sadder now than Gethsemane that\nfamiliar boat seemed to my eyes, for I knew very well that I should\nnever enter it more. I walked up and down the path, awaiting her: and\nfrom the jacket-pocket in which lay the revolver I drew a box of Swedish\nmatches, from it took two matches, and broke off a bit from the plain\nend of one; and the two I held between my left thumb and forefinger\njoint, the phosphorus ends level and visible, the other ends invisible:\nand I awaited her, pacing fast, and my brow was as stern as Azrael and\nRhadamanthus.\n\nShe came, very pale, poor thing, and flurried, breathing fast. And\n'Leda,' I said, meeting her in the middle of the lane, and going\nstraight to the point, 'we are to part, as you guess--for ever, as you\nguess--for I see very well by your face that you guess. I, too, am very\nsorry, my little child, and heavy is my heart. To leave you ... alone\n... in the world ... is--death for me. But it must, ah it must, be\ndone.'\n\nHer face suddenly turned as sallow as the dead were, when the shroud was\nalready on, and the coffin had become a stale added piece of\nroom-furniture by the bed-side; but in recording that fact, I record\nalso this other: that, accompanying this mortal sallowness, which\npainfully shewed up her poor freckles, was a steady smile, a little\nturned-down: a smile of steady, of slightly disdainful--Confidence.\n\nShe did not say anything: so I went on.\n\n'I have thought long,' said I, 'and I have made a plan--a plan which\ncannot be effective without _your_ consent and co-operation: and the\nplan is this: we go from this place together--this same night--to some\nunknown spot, some town, say a hundred miles hence--by train. There I\nget two motors, and I in one, and you in the other, we separate, going\ndifferent ways. We shall thus never be able, however much we may want\nto, to rediscover each other in all this wide world. That is my plan.'\n\nShe looked me in the face, smiling her smile: and the answer was not\nlong in coming.\n\n'I will go in the tlain with you,' says she with slow decisiveness: 'but\nwhere you leave me, there I will stay, till I die; and I will patiently\nwait till my God convert you, and send you back to me.'\n\n'That means that you refuse to do what I say?'\n\n'Yes,' said she, bowing the head with great dignity.\n\n'Well, you speak, not like a girl, Leda,' said I, 'but like a full woman\nnow. But still, reflect a minute.... O reflect! If you stayed where I\nleft you, I _should_ go back to you, and pretty soon, too: I know that I\nshould. Tell me, then--reflect well, and tell me--do you definitely\nrefuse to part with me?'\n\nThe answer was pretty prompt, cool, and firm:\n\n'Yes; I lefuse.'\n\nI left her then, took a turn down the path, and came back.\n\n'Then,' said I, 'here are two matches in my grasp: be good enough to\ndraw one.'\n\n_Now_ she was hit to the heart: I saw her eyes widen to the width of\nhorror, with a glassy stare: she had read of the drawing of lots in the\nBible: she knew that it meant death for me, or for her.\n\nBut she obeyed without a word, after one backward start and then a brief\nhovering in decision of thumb and forefinger over my held-out hand. I\nhad fixed it in my mind that if she drew the shorter of the matches,\nthen she should die; if the longer, then I should die.\n\nShe drew the shorter....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis was only what I should have expected: for I knew that God loved\nher, and hated me.\n\nBut instantly upon the first shock of the enormity that I should be her\nexecutioner, I made my resolve: to drop shot, too, at the moment after\nshe dropped shot, so disposing my body, that it would fall half upon\nher, and half by her, so that we might be close always: and that would\nnot be so bad, after all.\n\nWith a sudden movement I snatched the revolver from my pocket: she did\nnot move, except her white lips, which, I think, whispered:\n\n'_Not yet_....'\n\nI stood with hanging arm, forefinger on trigger, looking at her. I saw\nher glance once at the weapon, and then she fixed her eyes upwards upon\nmy face: and now that same smile, which had disappeared, was on her lips\nagain, meaning confidence, meaning disdain.\n\nI waited for her to open her mouth to say something--to stop that\nsmile--that I might shoot her quick and sudden: and she would not,\nknowing that I could not kill her while she was smiling; and suddenly,\nall my pity and love for her changed into a strange resentment and rage\nagainst her, for she was purposely making hard for me what I was doing\nfor her sake: and the bitter thought was in my mind: 'You are nothing to\nme: if you want to die, you do your own killing; and I will do my own\nkilling.' And without one word to her, I strode away, and left her\nthere.\n\nI see now that this whole drawing of lots was nothing more than a farce:\nI never could have killed her, smiling, or no smiling: for to each thing\nand man is given a certain strength: and a thing cannot be stronger than\nits strength, strive as it may: it is so strong, and no stronger, and\nthere is an end of the matter.\n\nI walked up to the Grand Bailli's _bureau_, a room about twenty-five\nfeet from the ground. By this time it was getting pretty dark, but I\ncould see, by peering, the face of a grandfather's-clock which I had\nlong since set going, and kept wound. It is on the north side of the\nroom, over the writing-desk opposite the oriels. It then pointed to\nhalf-past six, and in order to fix some definite moment for the bitter\neffort of the mortal act, I said: 'At Seven.' I then locked the door\nwhich opens upon three little steps near the desk, and also the\nstair-door; and I began to pace the chamber. There was not a breath of\nair here, and I was hot; I seemed to be stifling, tore open my shirt at\nthe throat, and opened the lower half of the central mullion-space of\none oriel. Some minutes later, at twenty-five to seven, I lit two\ncandles on the desk, and sat to write to her, the pistol at my right\nhand; but I had hardly begun, when I thought that I heard a sound at the\nthree-step door, which was only four feet to my left: a sound which\nresembled a scraping of her slipper; I stole to the door, and crouched,\nlistening: but I could hear nothing further. I then returned to the\ndesk, and set to writing, giving her some last directions for her life,\ntelling her why I died, how I loved her, much better than my own soul,\nbegging her to love me always, and to live on to please me, but if she\n_would_ die, then to be sure to die near me. Tears were pouring down my\nface, when, turning, I saw her standing in a terrified pose hardly two\nfeet behind me. The absolute stealth which had brought and put her\nthere, unknown to me, was like miracle: for the ladder, whose top I saw\nintruding into the open oriel, I knew well, having often seen it in a\nroom below, and its length was quite thirty feet, nor could its weight\nbe trifling: yet I had heard not one hint of its impact upon the window.\nBut there, at all events, she was, wan as a ghost.\n\nImmediately, as my consciousness realised her, my hand instinctively\nwent out to secure the weapon: but she darted upon it, and was an\ninstant before me. I flew after her to wrench it away, but she flew,\ntoo: and before I caught her, had thrown it cleanly through two rungs of\nthe ladder and the window. I dashed to the window, and after a hurried\npeer thought that I saw it below at the foot of a rock; away I flew to\nthe stair-door, wrung open the lock, and down the stairs, three at a\ntime, I ran to recover it. I remember being rather surprised that she\ndid not follow, forgetting all about the ladder.\n\nBut with a horrid shock I was reminded of it the moment I reached the\nbottom, before ever I had passed from the house: for I heard the report\nof the weapon--that crack, my God! and crying out: 'Well, Lord, she has\ndied for me, then!' I tottered forward, and tumbled upon her, where she\nlay under the incline of the ladder in her blood.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat night! what a night it was! of fingers shivering with haste, of\nharum-scarum quests and searches, of groans, and piteous appeals to God.\nFor there were no surgical instruments, lint, anaesthetics, nor\nantiseptics that I knew of in the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau; and though I knew of a house\nin Montreux where I could find them, the distance was quite infinite,\nand the time an eternity in which to leave her all alone, bleeding to\ndeath; and, to my horror, I remembered that there was barely enough\npetrol in the motor, and the store usually kept in the house exhausted.\nHowever, I did it, leaving her there unconscious on her bed: but _how_ I\ndid it, and lived sane afterwards, that is another matter.\n\nIf I had not been a medical man, she must, I think, have died: for the\nbullet had broken the left fifth rib, had been deflected, and I found\nit buried in the upper part of the abdominal wall. I did not go from her\nbed-side: I did not sleep, though I nodded and staggered: for all things\nwere nothing to me, but her: and for a frightfully long time she\nremained comatose. While she was still in this state I took her to a\nchalet beyond Villeneuve, three miles away on the mountain-side, a\nhomely, but very salubrious place which I knew, imbedded in verdures,\nfor I was desperate at her long collapse, and had hope in the higher\nair. And there after three more days, she opened her eyes, and smiled\nwith me.\n\nIt was then that I said to myself: 'This is the noblest, sagest, and\nalso the most loveable, of the creatures whom God has made in heaven or\nearth. She has won my life, and I will live.... But at least, to save\nmyself, I will put the broadest Ocean that there is between her and me:\nfor I wish to be a decent being, for the honour of my race, being the\nlast, and to turn out trumps ... though I do love my dear, God\nknows....'\n\nAnd thus, after only fifty-five days at the chalet, were we forced still\nfurther Westward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI wished her to remain at Chillon, intending, myself, to start for the\nAmericas, whence any sudden impulse to return to her could not be\neasily accomplished: but she refused, saying that she would come with me\nto the coast of France: and I could not say her no.\n\nAnd at the coast, after thirteen days we arrived, three days before the\nNew Year, traversing France by steam, air, and petrol traction.\n\nWe came to Havre--infirm, infirm of will that I was: for in my deep\nheart was the secret, hidden away from my own upper self, that, she\nbeing at Havre, and I at Portsmouth, we could still speak together.\n\nWe came humming into the dark town of Havre in a four-seat motor-car\nabout ten in the evening of the 29th December: a raw bleak night, she,\nit was clear, poor thing, bitterly cramped with cold. I had some\nrecollection of the place, for I had been there, and drove to the quays,\nnear which I stopped at the _Maire's_ large house, a palatial place\noverlooking the sea, in which she slept, I occupying another near.\n\nThe next morning I was early astir, searched in the _mairie_ for a map\nof the town, where I also found a _Bottin_: I could thus locate the\nTelephone Exchange. In the _Maire's_ house, which I had fixed upon to be\nher home, the telephone was set up in an alcove adjoining a very stately\n_salon_ Louis Quinze; and though I knew that these little dry batteries\nwould not be run down in twenty odd years, yet, fearing any weakness, I\nbroke open the box, and substituted a new one from the Company's stores\ntwo streets away, at the same time noting the exchange-number of the\ninstrument. This done, I went down among the ships by the wharves, and\nfixed upon the first old green air-boat that seemed fairly sound, broke\nopen a near shop, procured some buckets of oil, and by three o'clock had\ntested and prepared my ship. It was a dull and mournful day, drizzling,\nchilly. I returned then to the _mairie_, where for the first time I saw\nher, and she was heavy of heart that day: but when I broke the news that\nshe would be able to speak to me, every day, all day, first she was all\nincredulous astonishment, then, for a moment, her eyes turned white to\nHeaven, then she was skipping like a kid. We were together three\nprecious hours, examining the place, and returning with stores of\nwhatever she might require, till I saw darkness coming on, and we went\ndown to the ship.\n\nAnd when those long-dead screws awoke and moved, bearing me toward the\nOuter Basin, I saw her stand darkling, lonely, on the Quai through\nheart-rending murk and drizzly inclemency: and oh my God, the gloomy\nunder-look of those red eyes, and the piteous out-push of that little\nlip, and the hurried burying of that face! My heart broke, for I had not\ngiven her even one little, last kiss, and she had been so good, quietly\nacquiescing, like a good wife, not attempting to force her presence upon\nme in the ship; and I left her there, all widowed, alone on the\nContinent of Europe, watching after me: and I went out to the bleak and\ndreary fields of the sea.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nArriving at Portsmouth the next morning, I made my residence in the\nfirst house in which I found an instrument, a spacious dwelling facing\nthe Harbour Pier. I then hurried round to the Exchange, which is on the\nHard near the Docks, a large red building with facings of Cornish\nmoor-stone, a bank on the ground-floor, and the Exchange on the first.\nHere I plugged her number on to mine, ran back, rang--and, to my great\nthanksgiving, heard her speak. (This instrument, however, did not prove\nsatisfactory: I broke the box, and put in another battery, and still the\nvoice was muffled: finally, I furnished the middle room at the Exchange\nwith a truckle-bed, stores, and a few things, and here have taken up\nresidence.)\n\nI believe that she lives and sleeps under the instrument, as I here\nlive and sleep, sleep and live, under it. My instrument is quite near\none of the harbour-windows, so that, hearing her, I can gaze out toward\nher over the expanse of waters, yet see her not; and she, too, looking\nover the sea toward me, can hear a voice from the azure depths of\nnowhere, yet see me not.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI this morning early to her:\n\n'Good morning! Are you there?'\n\n'Good morning! No: I am there,' says she.\n\n'Well, that was what I asked--\"are you there\"?'\n\n'But I not here, I am there,' says she.\n\n'I know very well that you are not \"here,\"' said I, 'for I do not see\nyou: but I asked if you were there, and you say \"No,\" and then \"Yes.\"'\n\n'It is the paladox of the heart,' says she.\n\n'The what?'\n\n'The paladox,' says she.\n\n'But still I do not understand: how can you be both there and not\nthere?'\n\n'If my ear is here, and I elsewhere?' says she.\n\n'An operation?'\n\n'Yes!' says she.\n\n'What doctor?'\n\n'A specialist!' says she.\n\n'An ear-specialist?'\n\n'A heart!' says she.\n\n'And you let a heart-specialist operate on your ear?'\n\n'On myself he operlated, and left the ear behind!' says she.\n\n'Well, and how are you after it?'\n\n'Fairly well. Are you?' says she.\n\n'Quite well. Did you sleep well?'\n\n'Except when you lang me up at midnight. I have had such a dleam ...'\n\n'What?'\n\n'I dleamed that I saw two little boys of the same age--only I could not\nsee their faces, I never can see anybody's face, only yours and mine,\nmine and yours always--of the same age--playing in a wood....'\n\n'Ah, I hope that one of them was not called Cain, my poor girl.'\n\n'Not at all! neither of them! Suppose I tell a stoly, and say that one\nwas called Caius and the other Tibelius, or one John and the other\nJesus?'\n\n'Ah. Well, tell me the _dleam_....'\n\n'Now you do not deserve.'\n\n'Well, what will you do to-day?'\n\n'I? It is a lovely day ... have you nice weather in England?'\n\n'Very.'\n\n'Well, between eleven and twelve I will go out and gather Spling-flowers\nin the park, and cover the salon deep, deep. Wouldn't you like to be\nhere?'\n\n'Not I.'\n\n'You would!'\n\n'Why should I? I prefer England.'\n\n'But Flance is nice too: and Flance wants to be fliends with England,\nand is waiting, oh waiting, for England to come over, and be fliends.\nCouldn't some _lapplochement_ be negotiated?'\n\n'Good-bye. This talking spoils my morning smoke....'\n\nSo we speak together across the sea, my God.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the morning of the 8th April, when I had been separated thirteen\nweeks from her, I boarded several ships in the Inner Port, a lunacy in\nmy heart, and selected what looked like a very swift boat, one of the\nsmaller Atlantic air-steamers called the _Stettin_, which seemed to\nrequire the least labour in oiling, &c., in order to fit her for the\nsea: for the boat in which I had come to England was a mere tub, though\nsound, and I pined for the wings of a dove, that I might fly away to\nher, and be at rest.\n\nI toiled with fluttering hands that day, and I believe that I was of the\ncolour of ashes to my very lips. By half-past two o'clock I was\nfinished, and by three was coasting down Southampton Water by Netley\nHospital and the Hamble-mouth, having said not one word about anything\nat the telephone, or even to my own guilty heart not a word. But in the\nsilent depths of my being I felt this fact: that this must be a 35-knot\nboat, and that, if driven hard, hard, in spite of the heavy garment of\nseaweed which she trailed, she would do 30; also that Havre was 120\nmiles away, and at 7 P.M. I should be on its quay.\n\nAnd when I was away, and out on the bright and breezy sea, I called to\nher, crying out: '_I am coming!_' And I knew that she heard me, and that\nher heart leapt to meet me, for mine leapt, too, and felt her answering.\n\nThe sun went down: it set. I was tired of the day's work, and of\nstanding at the high-set wheel; and I could not yet see the coast of\nFrance. And a thought smote me, and after another ten minutes I turned\nthe ship's head back, my face screwed with pain, God knows, like a man\nwhose thumbs are ground between the screws, and his body drawn out and\nout on the rack to tenuous length, and his flesh massacred with pincers:\nand I fell upon the floor of the bridge contorted with anguish: for I\ncould not go to her. But after a time that paroxysm passed, and I rose\nup sullen and resentful, and resumed my place at the wheel, steering\nback for England: for a fixed resolve was in my breast, and I said: 'Oh\nno, no more. If I could bear it, I would, I would ... but if it is\nimpossible, how can I? To-morrow night as the sun sets--without fail--so\nhelp me God--I will kill myself.'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo it is finished, my good God.\n\nOn the early morning of the next day, the 9th, I having come back to\nPortsmouth about eleven the previous night, when I bid her 'Good\nmorning' through the telephone, she said 'Good morning,' and not another\nword. I said:\n\n'I got my hookah-bowl broken last night, and shall be trying to mend it\nto-day.'\n\nNo answer.\n\n'Are you there?' said I.\n\n'Yes,' says she.\n\n'Then why don't you answer?' said I.\n\n'Where were you all yesterday?' says she.\n\n'I went for a little cruise in the basin,' said I.\n\nSilence for three minutes: then she says:\n\n'What is the matter?'\n\n'Matter?' said I, 'nothing!'\n\n'_Tell me!_' she says--with such an intensity and rage, as to make me\nshudder.\n\n'There is nothing to tell, Leda!'\n\n'Oh, but how can you be so _cluel_ to me?' she cries, and ah, there was\nanguish in that voice! 'There is something to tell--there _is!_ Don't I\nknow it vely well by your voice?'\n\nAh, the thought took me then, how, on the morrow, she would ring, and\nhave no answer; and she would ring again, and have no answer; and she\nwould ring all day, and ring, and ring; and for ever she would ring,\nwith white-flowing hair and the staring eye-balls of frenzy, battering\nreproaches at the doors of God, and the Universe would cry back to her\nhowls and ravings only one eternal answer of Silence, of Silence. And as\nI thought of that--for very pity, for very pity, my God--I could not\nhelp sobbing aloud:\n\n'May God pity you, woman!'\n\nI do not know if she heard it: she _must_, I think, have heard: but no\nreply came; and there I, shivering like the sheeted dead, stood waiting\nfor her next word, waiting long, dreading, hoping for, her voice,\nthinking that if she spoke and sobbed but once, I should drop dead,\ndead, where I stood, or bite my tongue through, or shriek the high laugh\nof distraction. But when at last, after quite thirty or forty minutes\nshe spoke, her voice was perfectly firm and calm. She said:\n\n'Are you there?'\n\n'Yes,' said I, 'yes, Leda.'\n\n'What was the color,' says she, 'of the poison-cloud which destroyed the\nworld?'\n\n'Purple, Leda,' said I.\n\n'And it had a smell like almonds or peach blossoms, did it not?' says\nshe.\n\n'Yes,' said I, 'yes.'\n\n'Then,' says she, 'there is _another_ eruption. Every now and again I\nseem to scent strange whiffs like that ... and there is a purple vapour\nin the East which glows and glows ... just see if you can see it....'\n\nI flew across the room to an east window, threw up the grimy sash, and\nlooked. But the view was barred by the plain brick back of a tall\nwarehouse. I rushed back, gasped to her to wait, rushed down the two\nstairs, and out upon the Hard. For a minute I ran dodging wildly about,\nseeking a purview to the East, and finally ran up the dockyard, behind\nthe storehouses to the Semaphore, and reached the top, panting for life.\nI looked abroad. The morning sky, but for a bank of cloud to the\nnorth-west, was cloudless, the sun blazing in a region of clear azure\npallor. And back again I flew.\n\n'I cannot see it...!' I cried.\n\n'Then it has not tlavelled far enough to the north-west yet,' she said\nwith decision.\n\n'My wife!' I cried: 'you are my wife now!'\n\n'Am I?' says she: 'at last? Are you glad?... But shall I not soon die?'\n\n'No! You can escape! My home! My heart! If only for an hour or two, then\ndeath--just think, together--on the same couch, for ever, heart to\nheart--how sweet!'\n\n'Yes! how sweet! But how escape?'\n\n'It travelled slowly before. Get quick--will you?--into one of the\nsmaller boats by the quay--there is one just under the crane that is an\nair-boat--you have seen me turn on the air, haven't you?--that handle on\nthe right as you descend the steps under the dial-thing--get first a\nbucket of oil from the shop next to the clock-tower in the quay-street,\nand throw it over everything that you see rusted. Only, spend no\ntime--for me, my heaven! You can steer by the tiller and compass: well,\nthe wheel is quite the same, only just the opposite. First unmoor, then\nto the handle, then to the wheel. The course is directly North-East by\nNorth. I will meet you on the sea--go now--'\n\nI was wild with bliss. I thought that I should take her between my arms,\nand have the little freckles against my face, and taste her short\nfirm-fleshed upper-lip, and moan upon her, and whimper upon her, and\nmutter upon her, and say 'My wife.' And even when I knew that she was\ngone from the telephone, I still stood there, hoarsely calling after\nher: 'My wife! My wife!'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI flew down to where the steamer lay moored that had borne me the\nprevious day. Her joint speed with the speed of Leda's boat would be\nforty knots: in three hours we must meet. I had not the least fear of\nher dying before I saw her: for, apart from the deliberate movement of\nthe vapour that first time, I fore-tasted and trusted my love, that she\nwould surely come, and not fail: as dying saints fore-tasted and trusted\nEternal Life.\n\nI was no sooner on board the _Stettin_ than her engines were straining\nunder what was equivalent to forced draught. On the previous day it\nwould have little surprised me at any moment, while I drove her, to be\ncarried to the clouds in an explosion from her deep-rusted steel tanks:\nbut this day such a fear never crossed my mind: for I knew very well\nthat I was immortal till I saw her.\n\nThe sea was not only perfectly smooth, but placid, as on the previous\nday: only it seemed far placider, and the sun brighter, and there was a\nlevity in the breezes that frilled the sea in fugitive dark patches,\nlike _frissons_ of tickling; and I thought that the morning was a true\nmarriage-morning, and remembered that it was a Sabbath; and sweet odours\nour wedding would not lack of peach and almond, though, looking\neastward, I could see no faintest sign of any purple cloud, but only\nrags of chiffon under the sun; and it would be an eternal wedding, for\none day in our sight would be as a thousand years, and our thousand\nyears of bliss would be but one day, and in the evening of all that\neternity death would come and sweetly lay its finger upon our languid\nlids, and we should die of weary bliss; and all manner of dancings and\nsingings--fandango and light galliard, corantoes and the solemn\ngavotte--were a-tune in my heart that happy day; and running by the\nchart-house to the wheel, I saw under the table a great roll of old\nflags, and presently they were flying in a long curve of gala from the\nmain; and the sea rumpled in a long tract of tumbling milk behind me;\nand I hasted homeward, to meet my heart.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo purple cloud could I see as, on and on, for two hours, I tore\nsouthward: but at hot noon, on the weather beam I spied through the\nglass across the water something else which moved, and it was you who\ncame to me, Oh Leda, my spirit's breath!\n\nI bore down upon her, waving: and soon I saw her stand like an ancient\nmariner, but in white muslins that fluttered, at her wheel on the\nbridge--it was one of those little old Havre-Antwerp craft very high in\nthe bows--and she waved a little white thing. And we came nearer, till I\ncould spy her face, her smile, and I shouted her to stop, and in a\nminute stopped myself, and by happy steering came with slowing headway\nto a slight crash by her side, and ran down the trellised steps to her,\nand led her up; and on the deck, without saying a word, I fell to my\nknees before her, and I bowed my brow to the floor, with obeisance, and\nI worshipped her there as Heaven.\n\nAnd we were wedded: for she, too, bowed the knee with me under the\njovial blue sky; and under her eyes were the little moist semicircles of\ndreamy pensive fatigue, so dear and wifish: and God was there, and saw\nher kneel: for He loves the girl.\n\nAnd I got the two ships apart, and they rested there some yards divided\nall the day, and we were in the main-deck cabin, where I had locked a\ndoor, so that no one might come in to be with my love and me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI said to her:\n\n'We will fly west to one of the Somersetshire coal-mines, or to one of\nthe Cornwall tin-mines, and we will barricade ourselves against the\ncloud, and provision ourselves for six months--for it is perfectly\nfeasible, and we have plenty of time, and no crowds to break down our\nbarricades--and there in the deep earth we will live sweetly together,\ntill the danger is overpast.'\n\nAnd she smiled, and drew her hand across my face, and said:\n\n'No, no: don't you tlust in my God? do you think He would leally let me\ndie?'\n\nFor she has appropriated the Almighty God to herself, naming Him '_my_\nGod'--the impudence: though she generally knows what she is saying, too.\nAnd she would not fly the cloud.\n\nAnd I am now writing three weeks later at a little place called\nCh\u00c3\u00a2teau-les-Roses, and no poison-cloud, and no sign of any poison-cloud,\nhas come. And this I do not understand.\n\nIt may be that she divined that I was about to destroy myself ... she\nmay be quite capable.... But no, I do not understand, and shall never\nask her.\n\nBut _this_ I understand: that it is _the White_ who is Master here: that\nthough he wins but by a hair, yet he wins, he wins: and since he wins,\ndance, dance, my heart.\n\nI look for a race that shall resemble its Mother: nimble-witted,\nlight-minded, pious--like her; all-human, ambidextrous, ambicephalous,\ntwo-eyed--like her; and if, like her, they talk the English language\nwith all the r's turned into l's, I shall not care.\n\nThey will be vegetable-eaters, I suppose, when all the meat now extant\nis eaten up: but it is not certain that meat is good for men: and if it\nis really good, then they will _invent_ a meat: for they will be _her_\nsons, and she, to the furthest cycle in which the female human mind is\npermitted to orbit, is, I swear, all-wise.\n\nThere was a preaching man--a Scotchman he was, named Macintosh, or\nsomething like that--who said that the last end of Man shall be well,\nand very well: and she says the same: and the agreement of these two\nmakes a Truth. And to that I now say: Amen, Amen.\n\nFor I, Adam Jeffson, second Parent of the world, hereby lay down,\nordain, and decree for all time, clearly perceiving it now: That the one\nMotto and Watch-word essentially proper to each human individual, and to\nthe whole Race of Man, as distinct from other races in heaven or in\nearth, was always, and remains, even this: 'Though He slay me, yet will\nI trust in Him.'\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Purple Cloud, by M.P.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/etext06\n\n    (Or \/etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/0\/2\/3\/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/2\/4\/6\/8\/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n","id":1435,"split":"test"}
