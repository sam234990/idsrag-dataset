{"ori_id":"9c26a0e3cad380e2977b25e812a617e5083e73fd","title":"Old Friends and New Fancies","context":"Old Friends and New Fancies\n Old Friends and New Fancies is set in the same time as Austen's own novels and is similarly structured, with a focus on the challenges of matchmaking among pairs of lovers kept apart by various social and economic tensions. It has something of a postmodern overtone in that it mixes together characters from all six of Austen's major novels, creating an enormously extended network of friends, relations, and acquaintances. For example, Elizabeth (Bennet) Darcy (of Pride and Prejudice), Elinor (Dashwood) Ferrars (of Sense and Sensibility), and Anne (Elliot) Wentworth (of Persuasion) are all friends. Despite the fact that Brinton provides a full list of characters (sorted by their source books), keeping the cast straight is something many readers complain about, since quite a few of the characters are only mentioned in passing. Most of the characters are recognizably the same, though several have improved\u00e2\u0080\u0094among them Kitty Bennet and Tom Bertram\u00e2\u0080\u0094while George Knightley is somewhat sourer and Mary Crawford much less lively than in Austen's depictions. The largest single change from Austen's own books is that Marianne Dashwood's husband, Colonel Brandon, has died before the book opens. Although the book jacket proclaims that Brinton mixes in \"new characters of the author's devising,\" none of the new characters are of any great importance. Because many of the key characters hail from Pride and Prejudice, some critics treat Old Friends and New Fancies primarily as a sequel to that particular book. Mansfield Park is the next best represented novel in terms of major characters.\nThe chief protagonists of Old Friends and New Fancies are three young women, all unmarried at the outset: Georgiana Darcy and Kitty Bennet (Pride and Prejudice) and Mary Crawford (Mansfield Park). The novel begins some six months after the marriage of Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy; Darcy's sister Georgiana and cousin Colonel Fitzwilliam have gotten engaged but are not very happy together, and they soon break it off. Col. Fitzwilliam goes to visit Lady Catherine de Bourgh in Bath with the Darcys, where he meets and falls in love with Mary Crawford. Robert and Lucy (Steele) Ferrars have been cultivating Lady Catherine, and Lucy is hoping that Col. Fitzwilliam will marry her sister Anne. The Ferrars take the opportunity to slander Mary to Lady Catherine, resulting in her banishment from Lady Catherine's circle. Lonely and defiant, Mary begins spending time with an admiring Sir Walter Elliott, leading to a rumor that they are about to marry. Hearing this and feeling that his comparative poverty and lack of title make him a poor match for Mary, Col. Fitzwilliam removes himself from the scene, going to Ireland for a time. They are only reconciled after Col. Fitzwilliam is badly injured in a fall from his horse while hunting.\nMeanwhile, Kitty Bennet has gone to London as a proteg\u0102\u0160 of Emma (Woodhouse) Knightley. Although less flighty than formerly, she falls madly in love with William Price, a friend of the Knightleys and a naval officer who is the younger brother of Fanny (Price) Bertram of Mansfield Park. Georgiana visits Kitty in London, where she is introduced to William at a ball given by the Knightleys. Kitty later goes to stay with Elizabeth and Georgiana at Pemberley, and they try unsuccessfully to rein in her expectation of receiving a proposal of marriage from William. The Darcys give a ball at which William, instead of proposing to Kitty, declares his love to Georgiana. Georgiana, out of consideration for Kitty's feelings and confusion about her own, initially rebuffs William, but eventually the two become engaged, while a sobered Kitty pairs up with clergyman James Morland, whom Darcy has installed in a local parish. The latter denouement was hinted at by Austen herself in her letters, where she mentions that she can imagine Kitty married to a Derbyshire clergyman. Almost as an afterthought, Brinton also pairs up Tom Bertram and Isabella Thorpe, completing a sequence in which all of Brinton's characters destined for matrimony become engaged to someone from a different Jane Austen novel.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's Old Friends an New Fancies, by Sybil G.

Georgiana was then twenty, and had lived entirely with her\nbrother during the three and a half years of his married life. Reserved,\nshy, without self-reliance, and slow to form new attachments, she had\nbeen accustomed to look upon the Colonel as, after her brother, her\neldest and best friend, a feeling which the disparity of their ages\nserved to strengthen. She had therefore accepted the fact of their new\nrelations with a kind of timid pleasure, only imploring Elizabeth that\nnothing need be said about marriage for some time to come.\n\n\"Elizabeth, when I am married, shall I have to go and stay at Rosings\nwithout you?\" she had asked; and on being assured that such might be the\nterrible consequences of matrimony, she had manifested a strong\ninclination not to look beyond the present, but to enjoy for some time\nlonger the love and protection she had always met with as an inmate of\nher brother's house.\n\nLady Catherine de Bourgh had thought it necessary to go through the form\nof expressing displeasure at the whole proceeding, in consequence of\nDarcy's omission to ask her advice in the disposal of his sister's hand,\nbut in reality she so thoroughly approved of the match between her\nnephew and niece that she forgot her chagrin, and talked everywhere of\nher satisfaction in at last seeing a prospect of a member of the Darcy\nfamily being united to one who was in every respect worthy of the\nposition.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Darcy were seated in the library at Pemberley one April\nmorning when the engagement was about six months old. Their two\nchildren, a handsome boy of two, and a baby girl of a few months, had\njust been taken upstairs after the merry games with their parents to\nwhich this hour was usually devoted, and Elizabeth was arranging with\nher husband the plans for the day.\n\n\"What has become of Georgiana and Fitzwilliam?\" inquired Darcy. \"I\nunderstand they were going to ride together; but they both said they\nwould prefer to put it off till twelve o'clock, when I could go with\nthem.\"\n\n\"They have been walking on the terrace, but Georgiana has gone in now,\"\nreplied Elizabeth, glancing out of the window. She returned to her\nhusband's side, and, sitting down, began to speak with great\nearnestness. \"Do you think that they are really happy in their\nengagement? I have been watching them closely for some days, and I am\nconvinced that Georgiana, at all events, is not.\"\n\nMr. Darcy's manner expressed surprise and incredulity. \"What fancy is\nthis you have taken into your head, Elizabeth? No, certainly no such\nidea had ever crossed my own mind. You must be mistaken.\"\n\n\"I do not think so,\" said Elizabeth. \"Their relation to one another has\nnot, since he has been staying here this time, its former ease and\nnaturalness, and I have noticed other indications as well, which make me\nthink that freedom would bring them mutual relief.\"\n\n\"I am sorry for what you say, Elizabeth,\" said Darcy gravely; \"but it is\npossible you lay too much stress on what may be merely a passing mood.\nWhen we first consented to the engagement I thought them to be\nexcellently suited to each other, and so far I have not seen anything to\nmodify that opinion. What has Georgiana been saying to you?\"\n\n\"She has said nothing, but knowing her so well, I can see she is not\nhappy. She is nervous, restless, unlike herself; she tries to escape\nbeing alone with Robert; she avoids with a painful embarrassment any\nreference to her future plans; nay, you must have noticed incidents like\nthat of yesterday, when she almost cried and begged to be excused from\ngoing with us to Bath next week.\"\n\n\"That is mere foolishness; there is no shadow of reason why she should\nbe more afraid of her Aunt Catherine now than she ever was.\"\n\n\"There is more reason, if she dreads to hear her marriage talked of as\nrapidly approaching, and herself and Robert referred to as a most\nfortunate and admirably-assorted pair--you know how your aunt harangues\nthem on all occasions.\"\n\nDarcy smiled slightly, then rose and began to pace the room. \"If your\nconjectures are correct, Elizabeth, and Georgiana is unhappy in the\nprospect of this marriage, of course it cannot go on; but I shall be\ndeeply grieved for all reasons, and I hardly know how to ask Fitzwilliam\nto release her. Excellent fellow though he is, he might well resent\nbeing thrown over after half a year for what seems like a girlish\ncaprice.\"\n\n\"I do not believe that in any case he would resent it,\" replied\nElizabeth. \"There would be regret on both sides--regret that they had\nnot been able to make each other happy; but I more than suspect that if\nwe could ascertain his feelings, we should find them to coincide with\nGeorgiana's. In six months, you know, they have had time to reflect and\nto realize what the engagement means to both of them.\"\n\n\"You assume a good deal, Elizabeth. I cannot believe that it is so\nuncongenial to Fitzwilliam.\"\n\n\"That is because he is too good, too honourable to show it; and yet I am\nsensible that it is so--that his regard for Georgiana is that of a\nfriend, a brother, nothing more. I suppose you cannot remember the time\nwhen we were engaged, Darcy, and Bingley and Jane also?\" she added,\nlooking archly at her husband.\n\n\"My dear, I recollect it all with the deepest satisfaction; but, you\nknow, everyone does not display their feelings in the same way.\nFitzwilliam is an older man than I am, and was never prone to raptures,\nand Georgiana has not the liveliness of mind of my Elizabeth.\"\n\n\"I know they are not likely to be run away with by their feelings, as\nMr. Collins would say,\" replied Elizabeth, smiling; \"but even taking\nFitzwilliam's age and Georgiana's gravity into consideration, this is\nnot at all the same thing. I am convinced that they do not find that\ncomplete joy in their engagement that people should, and that these two\nmight if they were each engaged to the right person.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that Georgiana has seen someone whom she might prefer?\"\nasked Darcy sharply.\n\nElizabeth gave a decided negative to this, and her husband remained for\nsome minutes wrapped in thought. At length he roused himself, and said:\n\"You had better speak to Georgiana on the subject, Elizabeth, and if it\nis as you suppose, we will talk it over with Fitzwilliam together. For\nmy sister to dissolve her engagement is a serious step, and must be well\nconsidered.\"\n\nHis wife agreed, and added: \"Pray, dear Darcy, if it should come to an\nend, do not show any resentment in your manner towards Georgiana. She\ncannot help not caring enough for Fitzwilliam, and it will be painful\nenough for her to break with him and to know that she has disappointed\nyou.\"\n\n\"I will try not to do so, Elizabeth; but you know how much I desire a\nsafe and honourable settlement in life for Georgiana, such as this\nmarriage would have been.\"\n\n\"We both wished it so much that I am afraid we were led into mistaking\nthe real nature of their attachment,\" said his wife. \"At any rate, since\nwe assisted in bringing the affair about, we must share the\nresponsibility of ending it--a fact which your aunt is not likely to\nallow us to forget, is she, Darcy?\"\n\n\"True,\" returned Darcy. \"It is regrettable that the engagement was so\ngenerally made known. However, Georgiana may stay away from Bath if she\nprefers.\"\n\nIt was a relief to Elizabeth to have fairly talked her husband into\naccepting the possibility of such an unwelcome turn of affairs, for\nevents proved her misgivings to have been well founded. She had truly\ngauged the feelings of Georgiana and Fitzwilliam with regard to each\nother and to their engagement. Georgiana confessed, with deep distress\nand confusion, that she knew it was very ungrateful and naughty,\nbut--she did not seem to be able to care for her cousin in that way, and\nwould have said so before, but that she was afraid her brother and her\naunt would be angry. Fitzwilliam admitted that he had long feared his\ninability to make his cousin happy, but showed how very great was his\ndread of causing her, by his defection, to be wounded, reproached, or\nunkindly talked about. Elizabeth had a difficult task to smooth away all\nobstacles and to bring comfort to the minds of two very troubled and\nscrupulous people, besides her other duty of persuading her husband that\nthe separation was the right thing, and of shielding Georgiana from all\ndisagreeables; but in a few days everything had been accomplished except\nwhat time alone could do.\n\nDarcy could not altogether conceal his regret and disappointment at this\ntermination of his hopes, and Georgiana was miserable in the\nconsciousness that he blamed her for not having known her mind at the\nbeginning of the engagement. Had she really cared for Fitzwilliam, he\nwas convinced that it must have gone on to a happy conclusion; and\nnaturally his cousin could hardly be the one to uphold a different\nopinion. Fitzwilliam could only assert and reassert that Georgiana was\nundeserving of the slightest reproach, and endeavour to divert his\ncousin's attention to himself.\n\nIt was arranged that he should accompany the Darcys as usual to Bath,\nwhere they were to meet Lady Catherine, and meanwhile Georgiana accepted\nan invitation from Jane and Mr. Bingley, which on a hint from Elizabeth\nwas warmly extended to her, to go and stay with them at the same time at\ntheir house on the other side of Derbyshire.\n\n\n\n\nChapter II\n\n\nLady Catherine de Bourgh, with her daughter and Mrs. Jenkinson, had been\nestablished in her favourite lodgings in Pulteney Street since the\nmiddle of March. It had been her custom of late years to spend six or\nseven weeks in Bath every spring. She had considered it to be good for\nher daughter's health; she also considered that her own constitution and\nspirits benefited greatly by this yearly change of social environment.\nThe Rosings' card-parties lacked variety. Mr. and Mrs. Collins remained\nadmirable listeners, but their conversation, like their civilities,\noccasionally wore a little thin. Lady Catherine, would she but have\nadmitted it, thought that Mr. Collins was too much interested in his own\nasparagus-beds and too little in her peach-houses; and the ailments of\nthe children kept Mrs. Collins at home on several evenings when it would\nhave been convenient to the hostess at Rosings to make up a\nquadrille-table. Obviously the most suitable spot in which Lady\nCatherine and her daughter could have sought change of air would have\nbeen the residence of her nephew; but Darcy and Elizabeth had very\nearly in their married life made it clear that they did not intend their\nhouse to be turned into a hydropathic establishment for their ailing\nrelatives, and that they would entertain their visitors at such times\nand for as long as they chose; consequently Lady Catherine had been\nreduced to the expedient of going to Bath in the season, and to\nPemberley when she was asked. She, however, reserved to herself the\nright of insisting that her relatives should visit her at Bath, and\nDarcy, who wished to give no occasion of offence to his mother's only\nsister, was in the habit of taking his wife and sister down there every\nspring for a short stay at one of the hotels, thus forming among\nthemselves a pleasant and independent little party, which was usually\njoined by Colonel Fitzwilliam. This year Lady Catherine, having been\nthere for some weeks previously, had been collecting round her a circle\nof acquaintances, some more and some less likely to be congenial to the\nrelatives whose visit was pending.\n\n\"Elizabeth,\" said Mr. Darcy to his wife, as they stood together in Lady\nCatherine's drawing-room at a large reception which she was giving in\ntheir honour, two days after their arrival, \"I think I see General\nTilney over there; and, unless my memory is failing me, surely this is\nhis daughter coming towards us, whom we made friends with last year.\"\n\n\"Why, so it is; what a delightful surprise!\" exclaimed Elizabeth. \"Dear\nLady Portinscale, how glad I am to see you again! Do not say you have\nforgotten me, or I shall find it hard to forgive you!\"\n\n\"No, indeed, Mrs. Darcy, I was coming to introduce myself, in fear that\nyou might have forgotten me. How do you do, Mr. Darcy? Lady Catherine\ntold me that she was expecting the whole party from Pemberley this\nweek.\"\n\n\"Yes, we have come to put in our period of attendance, as you see,\" said\nElizabeth, \"but I never dreamed of anything so pleasant as meeting you\nagain, after what you said last year.\"\n\n\"The truth is that my father has not been at all well, and as he felt\nhimself obliged to come here for a short time, he begged us to join him\nfor two or three weeks.\"\n\n\"Your husband is here this evening?\"\n\n\"Yes, he is in the next room; I see him talking to Colonel Fitzwilliam.\"\n\n\"And are your brother and his pretty wife in Bath this spring? I\nremember her so well.\"\n\n\"No, they are at home; but we have a brother of hers staying with\nus--James Morland. He has a curacy in a very unhealthy part of the\nThames Valley, and he has been extremely ill with a low fever, so we\nhave brought him here for a fortnight in the hope that it will do him\ngood.\"\n\n\"How very kind of you to take care of him! He is fortunate to have such\nfriends.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, it is a very small thing; and he is such an excellent young\nfellow--sensible and agreeable, and so hard-working! My husband has the\nhighest opinion of him; and were he less amiable, it would be a pleasure\nto be of service to anyone connected with Catherine.\"\n\n\"You oblige me to repeat that anyone who has you for his or her advocate\nis indeed fortunate, Lady Portinscale,\" answered Elizabeth, smiling;\n\"but now that you know your character, pray perform the same kind office\nfor some of the people here. They are nearly all strangers to me, and\nif my husband were not listening, I should say that I wonder how my aunt\nmanages to pick them up.\"\n\n\"Lady Portinscale will soon gauge your character, Elizabeth, if you make\nsuch terribly outspoken comments,\" said Darcy, smiling. \"You must not\nmind her, Lady Portinscale; my aunt's presence has a demoralizing effect\nupon my wife. It is a very sad thing, but I have often remarked it.\"\n\n\"Not her presence in the ordinary way,\" said Elizabeth; \"but to-day we\nhave been through such a stormy scene together, that I may be excused\nfor feeling that my aunt and I must go diametrically opposite ways for\nthe rest of our lives.\"\n\n\"Really?\" said Eleanor Portinscale, with the faintest suspicion of\nlaughter in her eyes. \"Poor Lady Catherine! I recollect last year that\nyou and your sister-in-law were continually brewing some kind of\nrebellious mischief against her.\"\n\n\"That is just the cause of the trouble now,\" responded Elizabeth. \"My\nsister-in-law became engaged to Colonel Fitzwilliam last November; but I\nsaw that they were both so extremely unhappy in their engagement that I\nwas instrumental in breaking it off, and this happened only last week;\nso that is why Robert Fitzwilliam is looking ten years younger,\nGeorgiana is sheltering safely at home, and Lady Catherine is furiously\nangry with everyone all round, especially with me.\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" said Lady Portinscale with gentle sympathy. \"These things\ncannot be done without regrets and heartburnings. I hope it will mean\nreal happiness for them both in the end.\"\n\n\"One has to take that part of it on trust,\" was Elizabeth's answer; \"in\nthe meantime it has upset my husband dreadfully, and I am afraid he will\nnever be quite reconciled to it until he sees Georgiana happily married\nto somebody who has at present not appeared on the scene.\"\n\n\"I suppose she felt altogether disinclined for coming with you to Bath,\nelse she might have met friends here who would have distracted her\nthoughts.\"\n\n\"Yes; but, of course, she would not come, and I could hardly persuade\nher even to accept an invitation to go and stay with my sister Jane for\npart of the time that we shall be away. We left her in such terribly low\nspirits that it is really some consolation to see Colonel Fitzwilliam\nlooking as if a weight had been taken off his mind. It would be a sad\npity that we should all have got into hot water with Lady Catherine and\nnobody be a penny the better for it.\"\n\nLady Portinscale smiled. \"He is a very handsome man, and extraordinarily\nyoung-looking; he is nearly forty, is he not?\"\n\n\"Yes, one would not suspect him of it. There is Captain Wentworth\ntalking to him now; they seem to come here every year. Mrs. Wentworth\nand Georgiana became rather friendly, and they correspond. But those\nrelatives of hers are impossible! Why, what is going on? Lady Catherine\nseems to be carrying off Colonel Fitzwilliam; poor man, he was in such a\ncongenial group! Whom can she be introducing him to? They are people I\nnever saw before.\"\n\n\"I do not know them myself, but I have several times seen them with Lady\nCatherine,\" replied Lady Portinscale. \"They are called Ferrars; at\nleast, one of them is Mrs. Ferrars, I am not sure which.\"\n\nThe persons who had attracted Elizabeth's attention were three in\nnumber; the two ladies somewhat resembled one another, being rather\nthin, small in stature, and very elaborately dressed in the height of\nthe fashion. One of them might have been considered pretty, but for her\nsharp, almost shrewish features, restless eyes, and the discontented,\nirritable lines which had formed themselves in her face. The other had\nthese characteristics in a more marked degree, together with a general\nair of much less refinement and sense. It was not to be expected that\nLucy and Anne Steele would have altered very greatly for the better\nsince the empty-headed and overdressed fop who now accompanied them had\nexalted Lucy to the honour of becoming Mrs. Robert Ferrars. After four\nyears of family quarrels with Mrs. Ferrars and Mrs. John Dashwood, of\nspending more than her husband's income, of scheming to obtain Anne a\nhusband, of striving to push herself into fashionable society and to\nhold her own there; she found her only happiness in visits to gay\nwatering-places, where she could pick up new acquaintances, and in their\ncompany forget for a time the incessant worries and vexations of her\nhome-life. Anne spent the greater part of the year with her sister and\nbrother-in-law, occasionally diversifying her programme by a visit from\nMrs. Jennings, or to Elinor and Edward Ferrars, when out of kindness to\nLucy they would consent to receive her for a time; but these visits of\nAnne's to the rectory at Delaford were a trial to all concerned; and\nsince, on the death of Colonel Brandon, Edward had effected an exchange\nof livings with a clergyman in Derbyshire, Elinor ventured to hope that\nAnne would no longer find it a convenience to stay with persons who\nresided in such an out-of-the-way part of the country. For the present,\nboth Lucy and Anne were quite satisfied with their surroundings. They\nhad had the good fortune to become known to Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\nand by the exercise of all the tact, flattery and obliging manners at\ntheir command, had rendered themselves indispensable at whatever\nentertainments she gave, large or small, and were being treated by her\nwith such marked graciousness as to rouse their hopes of receiving an\ninvitation to Rosings, a mansion of the glories of which they had heard\nmuch, as had all Lady Catherine's friends. The introduction, on this\nevening, to such a handsome, soldierly and aristocratic-looking man as\nColonel Fitzwilliam was a piece of good luck which exceeded Anne's\nwildest dreams; and although, as soon as the proper civilities had been\nexchanged, he seized the first opportunity of returning to his men\nfriends, Anne lost no time in confiding to Lucy her extreme satisfaction\nat the addition of such a very smart beau to Lady Catherine's party.\n\n\"Don't be a fool, Nancy,\" was Lucy's answer, in somewhat discouraging\ntones; \"what's the good of expecting a man like that to look at you?\nAnd, besides, isn't he engaged to Mr. Darcy's sister?\"\n\n\"No,\" Anne answered eagerly, \"the engagement's broke off. Miss de Bourgh\ntold me so to-day. And fancy Lady Catherine introducing him to us at\nonce! She must want us to be all friends together, mustn't she?\"\n\n\"Well, it's likely you'll go and spoil it in some way; you never caught\nthe doctor, for all his attention,\" Lucy responded with true sisterly\ncandour, \"and I expect we'll find we don't see much of Colonel\nFitzwilliam. He's staying at the hotel with the Darcys, and from the\nlook of Mrs. Darcy I don't know as she'll want to do just what Lady\nCatherine tells her, all day long.\"\n\n\"I shall go and sit by Miss de Bourgh,\" said Nancy, after a moment's\ncontemplation of this dismal prospect, \"and perhaps Lady Catherine will\nintroduce me to the Darcys. You'd better come too, Lucy. We can't get\nalong without knowing them now.\"\n\nLucy consented, after some demur; and in the course of the evening their\nhopes of an introduction were realized, and their self-importance\ngreatly increased; for Mrs. Darcy, curious to ascertain what kind of\nhangers-on had found places in her aunt's _cort\u00c3\u00a8ge_ this year, had\nconversed for a short time with them both; and with the prudence and\nconsideration which was characteristic of her, had refrained from\nexpressing to her husband the full extent of the unfavourable impression\nwhich they created.\n\n\"I do not much care for those new friends of my aunt's,\" Darcy remarked\nto his wife when they reached home.\n\n\"Why, my dear, you were not even introduced to them,\" exclaimed\nElizabeth. \"Robert, I noticed, did not escape, but you did. Besides,\nthey are related to the Ferrars at home; there is no getting away from\nthat.\"\n\n\"I gathered that they were, but I can hardly believe it. That man\nbrother to Edward Ferrars! I heard him trying to argue with Robert about\nNelson's tactics at the battle of the Nile, and it was enough for me. I\nhave heard far sounder sense talked at a tenants' dinner--at the end of\none, too.\"\n\nFitzwilliam and Elizabeth laughed. \"His views upon life in general\nappeared to suffer somewhat from lack of breadth,\" said the former, \"and\nI can imagine it would be possible to find him a tedious companion. As\nfor the ladies of the party, I did not have much conversation with\nthem.\"\n\n\"I think the look of them rather frightened Robert,\" said Elizabeth;\n\"but, on the whole, they are tolerably unobjectionable. After all, one\ncan't always pick and choose at a place like Bath, and, anyhow, we must\nbe civil to Aunt Catherine's friends--it is not for very long. I am\nreally going to practise what I preach, so you need not look at me like\nthat, Mr. Darcy.\"\n\nThe following evening the whole party met again at a concert in aid of a\ncharity, which had been patronized by Lady Catherine to the extent of\nseveral pounds' worth of tickets. The morning had been spent by the\nDarcys and Fitzwilliam in their own occupations; but they had been\nobliged to dine with their aunt, and to meet at dinner the Robert\nFerrars, with Miss Anne Steele. General Tilney, Lady Portinscale's\nfather, and his son Frederick made up the requisite number of gentlemen,\nand Elizabeth found much to divert her in watching, during dinner, the\nmanoeuvres of Miss Steele, who, seated between the two bachelors, was\nfully occupied in efforts to make herself equally and incessantly\nagreeable to both of them; the dire failure of which might have aroused\nsome compassion had she not been so completely self-satisfied and\nconfident. Captain Tilney certainly kept up the conversation in the\nstyle that was expected of him as long as he could, and then turned to\nMiss de Bourgh and devoted himself to her, having been informed by his\nfather that she was a considerable heiress, and his attentions to her\nmust be regulated accordingly. Colonel Fitzwilliam, for his part, found\nthree-cornered discussion carried on with great animation between\nhimself, his aunt, and General Tilney, who sat opposite, on the military\ngenius of the French generals, considerably more interesting than Miss\nSteele's observation on the Bath assemblies and her openly-expressed\npredilection in favour of officers as partners. Elizabeth and her\nhusband were no better off in their respective companions. The inanities\nof Robert Ferrars, and the pretensions of his wife, were calculated to\nput a severe strain on the good intentions of Lady Catherine's niece\nand nephew towards her guests.\n\n\"How elegantly Lady Catherine's dinner-parties are always carried out!\"\nremarked Lucy to Mr. Darcy, in a kind of loud aside, as they unfolded\ntheir napkins. \"She seems to be one of those fortunate persons who\nalways manage to have everything about them as _recherch\u00c3\u00a9_ as it is at\nhome, wherever they may be staying. Don't you think so, Mr. Darcy? No\none else could have made this apartment what it is, but with Lady\nCatherine's delightful appointments you could, I daresay, easily imagine\nyourself to be in one of the smaller dining parlours at Rosings, could\nyou not?\"\n\nMr. Darcy was rather taken aback by this speech, and hastily making a\nmental review of his aunt's usual visitors, failed entirely to connect\nMrs. Robert Ferrars with the dining parlour, or any other room at\nRosings; so his reply was not very satisfactory to his questioner.\n\n\"It seems a pleasant and convenient room. My aunt, I believe, generally\ntakes these lodgings; and when she settles down in a place for a few\nweeks, naturally likes to make it comfortable.\"\n\n\"Oh, but I think it is a special gift of dear Lady Catherine's,\"\nexclaimed Lucy. \"You cannot deny it, Mr. Darcy, knowing Rosings as you\ndo. Now at our lodgings--well, I daresay the rooms are very little\nsmaller than this--but try as I will, I cannot give them a home-like\nair, though I assure you I brought two large packing-cases of dainty\ntrifles from our country house.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Darcy.\n\n\"Yes, but the lavish refinement, combined with substantial comfort, of\nLady Catherine's surroundings always appeals to me so strongly when I\ncome here. I am sure you understand what I mean, Mr. Darcy, with a home\nlike Pemberley as a standard to judge other people's houses by.\"\n\n\"I had not regarded Bath lodgings from that point of view,\" said Mr.\nDarcy. \"Are you making a long stay here, may I ask?\"\n\n\"Yes, we hope to remain for some weeks. I always enjoy Bath so much at\nthis time of year; and so does Mr. Ferrars. I consider it infinitely\npreferable to the autumn season, do not you, Mr. Darcy? All the best\npeople seem to come now, and one is not likely to meet anyone whose\nacquaintance one would not wish to continue afterwards.\"\n\nMr. Darcy took advantage of this pause, during which his companion\nhelped herself to fish, to consider what reply he should truthfully make\nto such a sentiment; but before Mrs. Ferrars could insist upon his\nagreeing with her, he was called upon by his aunt from the end of the\ntable to support her in a flat contradiction of General Tilney, who was\nundoubtedly getting the best of a somewhat heated argument. Elizabeth\nwas not more fortunate in her companion. The wearisome descriptions of\nthis or that friend's house, habits, achievements, which were all that\nRobert Ferrars could contribute to the conversation, were almost more\nthan could be endured with patience throughout a long dinner, even by\none who could derive quiet amusement from almost any kind of harmless\nabsurdity; and it was with a sigh of relief that Elizabeth heard her\naunt's peremptory command that everyone should go and put on their coats\nand cloaks, for she would not have her party arrive late for the\nbeginning of the concert.\n\nThe ladies were distributed among various coaches, while the gentlemen\nwalked on. Elizabeth found that her companions were to be her cousin and\nMiss Anne Steele; and during the drive she had leisure to remark, with\ngreat astonishment, the evident intimacy which existed between the young\nwomen. Anne tried to draw her into their discussions; but finding Mrs.\nDarcy resolutely silent, she turned to Miss de Bourgh, and began to\nrally her on the becomingness of the gown which the latter was wearing,\naccompanying her remarks with many giggles, mysterious whispers and\ncovert references to \"favourite colour\" and \"smart uniforms\" which made\nElizabeth wonder that her cousin could tolerate such treatment for an\ninstant. But poor Anne de Bourgh's nature, only half developed by reason\nof her ill-health and her mother's forcefulness of character, had\nyielded entirely to the dominating influence exercised over her by a\nperson nearer her own age, and one who made an effort to understand and\nplay upon her weakness. Elizabeth soon began to perceive the secret of\nthe intimacy--Miss Steele, in her anxiety to recommend herself to the de\nBourgh family, had discovered that by enlivening and flattering the\ndaughter she might best become a person of value to the mother. Anne\nSteele's last words before the carriage stopped were intended to be\ninaudible to Elizabeth, and put the final touch to her disgust and\ndislike.\n\n\"Me and Lucy will be _so_ miserable if you give us up now these grand\ncousins of yours are come down, Miss Anne!\"\n\nMiss de Bourgh made what was for her a vehement motion of dissent, and\nwhen they had entered the room, Elizabeth, having piloted her charges to\nLady Catherine's side, found a seat for herself as far as possible from\nanyone connected with the Steele family. Her husband joined her just\nbefore the concert began, and in the double pleasure of listening to the\nmusic and feeling his proximity, she forgot the previous vexations of\nthe evening.\n\n\"Well, how have you been getting on?\" inquired a voice behind her, in\nthe first pause.\n\n\"Why, Fitzwilliam!\" exclaimed Darcy, glancing round, \"what business have\nyou up at this end? You ought to be squiring the young ladies down there\nby my aunt.\"\n\n\"Poor Robert!\" said Elizabeth. \"He is only off duty for half an hour.\"\n\n\"That is it,\" replied Colonel Fitzwilliam. \"I was exhausted, and seeing\nthis empty chair, I forthwith occupied it. Besides, I want to hear the\nharp solo in peace and quiet. I have not heard the harp played for\nyears, and I am exceedingly fond of it.\"\n\n\"That is the next one, I see. Hush, now! I know this man is going to\nsing out of tune. He looks like it.\"\n\n\"We ought to have some compensation for listening to that,\" murmured\nDarcy, when the song was done. \"I believe Mr. Collins would have given\nus a better performance.\"\n\n\"He certainly is rather like Mr. Collins,\" remarked Elizabeth\nreflectively. \"Here comes the harp--and what a lovely girl! Is her name\non the programme? Yes, Miss Crawford.\"\n\nMary Crawford, who since Dr. Grant's death had entirely lived with her\nsister, Mrs. Grant, at Bath, had lost none of the beauty and charm which\nhad captivated the heart of Edmund Bertram: indeed, the four years which\nhad elapsed since then had given her form and air more regal elegance.\nThe knowledge of sorrow, and regret that she had so much to injure her\nown chances of happiness, had softened her nature, and now, more gentle,\nwomanly and sympathetic, she was in many ways a different creature from\nthe brilliant Miss Crawford of former days. Mrs. Grant, while loving her\ndevotedly and rejoicing in her companionship, still grieved in secret\nthat no suitor worthy of her dear Mary should ever have succeeded Edmund\nBertram, and that no second attachment should have taken place of one\nwhich, though renounced without bitterness, had nevertheless left a deep\nmark upon her sister's character. In Bath their lives were full of\ninterest, and they made many friends; but Mary always laughed at her\nsister's plans for her marrying, and returned the same kind of answer.\n\"I expect so much, you know, and the chosen he must expect so little,\nthat I doubt whether we should ever come to terms.\"\n\nHer sister would protest against this, knowing well the real worth of\nthe disposition which Mary hid under a careless and sometimes cold\nmanner; but she also knew that Mary would be more difficult to satisfy,\nboth as regards her own qualities and those of her possible husband, in\nconsequence of the better taste she had acquired at Mansfield. This\nevening, Miss Crawford, who had consented to perform solely on account\nof the charitable object of the concert, was out of humour with herself\nand all the world. Her sister being unwell, she had been obliged to\naccept an escort to the concert, the company of Sir Walter and Miss\nElliot, whom, as residents in Bath, she had known since the time of her\nsister's settling there. Miss Crawford's beauty of face and figure were\nexactly what would recommend Sir Walter; and while condemning her sister\nas dull and unfashionable, nothing delighted him more than to be seen in\npublic as squire of the charming and elegant Miss Crawford. Six months'\nacquaintance had caused her, on her side, thoroughly to weary of him,\nand on the few occasions when she could not avoid a meeting she\nendeavoured to converse with his eldest daughter, whom she found only a\ndegree less tiresome and empty-headed. To-night, however, there was no\nhelp for it. With them she had come, with them she must remain,\nunluckily placed at a distance from any of her other Bath friends, her\nenjoyment of the music spoiled by her companions' irrelevant chatter,\nher only pleasure to acquit herself creditably in the piece she had\nchosen to play. This, at all events, was in her power, she felt, as she\nascended the platform and shook off sensations of listlessness and\nennui; and she succeeded so well that the audience were roused to a\ndisplay of their delight and enthusiasm, and she had to return twice to\nacknowledge their plaudits. Next moment she perceived, or thought she\nperceived, that owing to an increased crowd in the lower part of the\nroom she could not easily get back to her seat without making a little\ndisturbance; so she slipped into a chair in the front row, which was\nallotted to the performers, thankful even for a short respite.\n\nWhen the interval came, she remained where she was, and, a few minutes\nlater, seeing the gentleman who had been the chief promoter of the\nconcert trying to attract her attention, she rose unwillingly, supposing\nthat Sir Walter Elliot had come to claim her. What was her surprise to\nhear Mr. Durand say: \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh particularly wishes to\nknow you. May I present you to her?\"\n\nMary felt that she had not had much choice in the matter, but she found\nherself curtseying to a tall and formidable-looking elderly lady,\ndressed in rich brocades, who surveyed her as if from a great height,\nand said: \"Allow me to tell you, Miss Crawford, how much pleased I was\nwith your late performance on the harp. I have heard every harp player\nof note in Europe during the last forty years, and I may say I consider\nyou quite equal to those of the second rank. Though not a performer\nmyself, I am quite acquainted with the difficulties of the instrument.\"\n\nMary hardly knew whether to be more vexed or amused at this\nextraordinary address, and might have been inclined towards the former,\nhad not Mrs. Darcy, who had seen the beginning of the incident, and\nhastened forward lest her aunt's insolent patronage should offend,\ninterposed with a kindly: \"We have all been enjoying your piece so much.\nIt must be delightful to be able to play like that. My aunt is such a\nlover of music that she cannot hide her enthusiasm.\"\n\n\"And why should I hide it, may I ask?\" demanded Lady Catherine. \"My\njudgment has often been of great service to young amateurs, among whom\nyou might include yourself, Elizabeth.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" replied Elizabeth, good-humouredly. \"But Miss Crawford\ncannot be classed with the average amateur. May I introduce myself, as\nMr. Durand has gone away? I am Mrs. Darcy. I saw you sitting with the\nElliots, so perhaps you know a great friend of mine, Mrs. Wentworth.\"\n\nMiss Crawford was about to enter gladly into the subject of Mrs.\nWentworth, when Lady Catherine interposed, and in a few minutes, before\nMary had quite realized what was happening, she found herself giving the\nassurance that Mrs. Grant would be delighted to receive a visit from\nLady Catherine and Mrs. Darcy, and that she herself would be present at\nLady Catherine's reception in Pulteney Street in a fortnight's time. She\nhardly knew how it had all come about, and she found herself wondering,\nas she was led back to her seat by Sir Walter Elliot, whether it was\nLady Catherine's domineering manner, or Mrs. Darcy's kind looks, that\nshe had yielded to so easily. The Elliots were eager with their\nquestions. What? she did not know that that was Lady Catherine de\nBourgh? Everyone knew Lady Catherine, she came to Bath every year--a\nvery well-preserved old lady, must be quite sixty and does not look more\nthan forty-eight--people of property--large estate in Kent--\"an\nacquaintance quite worth following up, my dear Miss Crawford; of course\n_we_, with our already large circle of friends, could not attempt to\ninclude persons who only come here for a short time; otherwise we should\nhave been very happy to have visited Lady Catherine.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter III\n\n\nThe Darcys found plenty to enjoy during their stay in Bath, as after\ndutifully allotting part of the day to a call on Lady Catherine, or to\njoining her at the Lower Rooms, they were free to make their own\nengagements, and passed a good deal of their time with Lord and Lady\nPortinscale, Mr. Morland and the Wentworths, Colonel Fitzwilliam\ninvariably forming one of the party. James Morland, the Portinscales'\nyoungest guest, had favourably impressed them from the first, being a\nyoung man of sense, education and good address. The experience he had\ngained from his somewhat unfortunate friendship with the Thorpe family,\nfollowed by his closer acquaintance with the Tilneys, had been an\nincalculable benefit to him in helping to form his character and in\nteaching him what are the qualities in a friend which win sincere love\nand respect. Hard work, resolution and regret for his own follies, and\nthe encouragement and kindness he had received from his relations, had\ncombined to put Isabella Thorpe out of his head, and to recuperate a\nheart he had thought blighted over for ever. He had within the last few\nweeks been obliged to resign the curacy he had held since his\nordination, on account of the ill effects of the air of the valley on\nhis health; and was now earnestly hoping to grow strong enough to resume\nwork in some other part of the country, as he had, of course, resolved\nupon remaining a bachelor all his life, and making his church and parish\nsuffice in place of domestic joys. His somewhat diffident manner in the\nsociety of men so much older than himself as Mr. Darcy and Captain\nWentworth did him no disservice with them; and before they had known the\nparticulars of his history for many days, Mr. Darcy was meditating upon\nthe possibility of giving him material assistance in his career.\n\nIn the meantime, Elizabeth, independently of Lady Catherine, had\nexchanged calls with Mrs. Grant, whom she found anxious to be friendly,\nmore anxious, indeed, than Mary, who, while appreciating Mrs. Darcy's\nkindness and charm, greatly disliked the patronizing manners of the\nmistress of Rosings Park. A few days after the concert the sisters spent\na morning in Mrs. Darcy's sitting-room. Elizabeth had never neglected\nher study of the pianoforte or of singing, and as Mary, at the earnest\nrequest of her hostess, had brought her harp, the pleasure of the whole\nparty, sometimes in conversation, sometimes in music, was ensured.\n\n\"Colonel Fitzwilliam is very fond of music, is he not?\" Mrs. Grant said\nto Mrs. Darcy, glancing across the room to where the Colonel and her\nsister were engaged in animated discussion of the latest importations\nfrom German composers. \"He really does like it, does not praise it out\nof mere politeness?\"\n\n\"My dear Mrs. Grant! He is the most enthusiastic amateur I know. I often\ntell my husband that he would never have fallen in love with me if\nColonel Fitzwilliam and I had not struck up a friendship over music,\nwhich made him think there was more in me than he had perceived before.\nHe himself is not such a good judge of it, but my cousin was greatly\nstruck with your sister's playing the other night, and it really is\nappreciation from him.\"\n\n\"I am so glad: it will be a pleasure to Mary to meet him. Excuse my\nasking--I cannot quite understand--does he live with you or with your\naunt?\"\n\n\"With neither; he is our guest when we are in Bath, and he stays a great\ndeal with us in the country; but he has rooms in London, and, I think,\nhonestly prefers town as a residence, but that he is so fond of my\nhusband and all his belongings.\"\n\nThere was a pause, and then Elizabeth added, a sudden thought having\nflashed through her mind: \"He is an excellent man; it is impossible for\nus to think more highly of anyone than we do of him; but he labours\nunder what he considers to be an insuperable disadvantage--he is a\nyounger son, and therefore not much blessed with this world's goods.\"\n\nShe had hardly finished speaking when the door opened to admit two\nladies, whom she recognized as her aunt's latest prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9es.\n\n\"Dear me!\" exclaimed Anne Steele, before she was fairly in the room;\n\"quite a cosy little musical party, I declare! Lord! what a pity we have\ninterrupted the music! We wouldn't have if we'd have known! And here\nwe've run all the way upstairs--\"\n\nLucy managed to silence her sister, and began a kind of tour of the\nroom, making formal greetings to everyone she knew, and pausing in so\npointed a way before Mrs. Grant and Mary, that Elizabeth, with great\nreluctance, was obliged to introduce Mrs. Robert Ferrars and Miss\nSteele. This accomplished, Lucy's errand was allowed to be divulged.\n\n\"We are driving out with Lady Catherine in the barouche landau, and she\ncalled here in passing, to say if Colonel Fitzwilliam was in she would\nlike him to come too and make a fourth,\" she explained, with assistance\nfrom Anne. \"We are not going far,\" she added for the benefit of the\ncompany in general; \"only to Monkton Combe and back before dinner. Poor\nMiss de Bourgh is so very unwell to-day she did not feel inclined to\ndrive out; and my sister and I just happened to be calling in Pulteney\nStreet as Lady Catherine was starting out, so she was so very kind as to\nbring us along.\"\n\n\"It is fortunate,\" said Elizabeth smilingly, \"that my aunt was able to\nsecure your companionship; for, as I have visitors, I am not sure that I\ncould spare my cousin this morning.\" She glanced at Fitzwilliam, who was\nimpatiently waiting for an opportunity to answer. \"No, certainly not. I\nam much obliged, but I am not able to come to-day.\"\n\nMiss Steele's manner suffered from a diminution of sprightliness, even\nwhile she urged on the Colonel the necessity of taking advantage of the\nfine weather; but Darcy quietly interposed with: \"Is my aunt's carriage\nat the door?\" Lucy was obliged to admit that it was.\n\n\"Shall we go and make your excuses then, Fitzwilliam,\" he continued, \"if\nour guests will kindly excuse us for a moment? Will you give Mrs.\nFerrars your arm? Mrs. Ferrars, I greatly regret not being able to\ndetain you, but I know it would not be kind, as my aunt has such a\ndislike to be kept waiting, especially in the open street.\"\n\nThe result of this was, that without quite knowing how it happened, Lucy\nand her sister found themselves in the hall again almost as soon as the\nwaiter showed them up; were in the carriage, and driving away, the\napologies of the gentlemen having been graciously accepted, and Mr.\nDarcy was saying to his friend as they returned: \"The only way with\nthese people is firmness; you are much too gentle.\"\n\n\"I don't feel particularly gentle after that interruption,\" replied the\nother, \"though you got me out of it very well. My aunt seems to have a\nspecial grudge against me this time. I suppose she is working off her\nirritation; well, rather on me than on your sister.\"\n\n\"I do not believe it is that,\" answered Darcy; \"she is, and always was,\na tool in the hands of unscrupulous flatterers. If it were worthwhile,\nElizabeth and I would rush to the rescue; but there is sure to be a\ntremendous explosion before long; they will all quarrel violently, she\nwill come and tell us that they are ungrateful vipers, or something like\nthat, and next year it will begin all over again with someone else.\"\n\n\"Well!\" cried Elizabeth, as they opened the door, \"did Aunt Catherine\nmind?\"\n\n\"No, he has got off with a whole skin this time,\" replied her husband,\n\"or rather, not quite a whole one, for he has had to pledge himself to\njoin the expedition to Clifton to-morrow instead.\"\n\n\"I had forgotten that expedition to Clifton,\" Elizabeth exclaimed in\ndismay; \"I wish it would rain! But if it did, we should only have to go\nanother day. Mr. Morland, have you been to Clifton? Oh, do say it will\nbe quite new to you! You can't? Is there no one who has never been\nthere? My aunt makes up a party every year, for her newest friends, and\nwe always do the same things and make the same remarks.\"\n\nElizabeth's forecast created much amusement, and Miss Crawford said:\n\"Everything I hear beforehand of Lady Catherine is very alarming to a\nstranger like myself. I shall have to have caught a bad cold before her\nreception next week, for I shall not have the courage to appear and\nplay.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Miss Crawford, you must appear,\" said Darcy. \"We are all too\nbad, with our jokes about her, for really she means to be very kind. But\nwe have got into shocking ways since my wife married into the family.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I think I have educated you all admirably.\"\n\n\"You are a privileged person, you see,\" said Colonel Fitzwilliam. \"Miss\nCrawford, will you do us the kindness of playing again? I want to reap\nthe advantage of the present moment, as the reception is a long way\noff.\"\n\nThe lady acceded with willingness, and at the conclusion of her piece\nColonel Fitzwilliam sat down near her and found himself soon conversing\nwith more ease and enjoyment than he had done for many months. Their\ntalk was only of the most ordinary subjects; but the Colonel's\nsimplicity and culture appealed to the best that was in Mary, and he\nfound in her a ready sympathy, felt rather than expressed. His views of\nLondon life--so pleasant, so stimulating for the greater part of the\nyear, but the country was better for a permanent home--exactly coincided\nwith Mary's; and almost to her surprise, she heard herself vehemently\nasserting that town might be the place to make friends, but the country\nwas the place to enjoy them. \"You are a lover of country sports?\"\nquestioned the Colonel; \"of riding and driving?\" Mary answered\nenthusiastically, though repressing a sigh at the recollection of her\nfirst riding lessons. Did she ride at Bath? He could recommend her some\ngood livery stables. His cousin, Mrs. Darcy, did not care for it, else\nsome agreeable plans might have been made.\n\nMeantime, the conversation was quite as animated in the other group.\nJames Morland was asking if the ladies were those whom General Tilney\nand his son had lately met at dinner in Pulteney Street.\n\n\"Yes, you are right,\" replied Elizabeth. \"Did you hear of that\ndinner-party?\"\n\n\"Lady Portinscale told me. I should not otherwise have known, for I\ndon't see much of the General and Captain Tilney,\" James Morland\nanswered with a smile.\n\n\"I thought Eleanor told me all was forgiven?\"\n\n\"Catherine is, but her relations do not pass the censor. Still, it does\nnot matter in the least, so long as he is kind to her, and I think I may\nsay he is.\"\n\n\"I suppose he is often at the Portinscales'?\" observed Elizabeth.\n\n\"Fairly often, but Lord Portinscale contrives that he does not stay too\nlong; he thinks it worries Eleanor, and, as you know, she is anxious to\ntake care of herself and go in thoroughly for the cure.\"\n\n\"Dear Eleanor! I am so devoted to her.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, one would be; she is the kindest friend anyone could\npossibly have. Do you know, Mrs. Darcy, they insist on my having a\nsitting-room to myself, where I can read undisturbed, or I can spend my\ntime with them, just as I like.\"\n\n\"That is a nice arrangement; and you are better for coming to Bath?\"\n\n\"Yes, a great deal better. I should be able to get to work in a very\nshort time now, if only\" (rather mournfully), \"some work could be\nfound.\"\n\n\"I am sure it can, if you are patient,\" said Elizabeth kindly. \"The very\nthing one wants often drops upon one unexpectedly. Do you know our part\nof the world at all? You must come and pay us a visit some time; the\nDerbyshire air is splendidly bracing, and would benefit you.\"\n\nMorland said all that was proper, and Elizabeth, who had been trying\nunsuccessfully to catch her husband's eye, continued: \"We are fortunate\nin our Rector at home, and even more fortunate in his wife; they have\njust come to Pemberley, and oddly enough, they are related to these very\npeople of whom we have been talking, but as different from them as\npossible.\"\n\n\"Indeed! the Ferrars, or Steele--I have not made them out yet--\"\n\n\"Mr. Edward Ferrars, our Rector, is a brother of Mr. Robert Ferrars,\nhusband of the lady in blue. It is rather difficult to keep Mrs. Robert\nFerrars off the subject when she is with us, as she seems to think it\nestablishes a sort of connection, although they don't visit their\nrelations.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they will do so now,\" said Morland, with a slight smile. \"It is\nyour own parish that you mentioned?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is a fair-sized village that has grown up round the house, or,\nrather, round a much older house that formerly stood on the site. It is\nsuch beautiful country, Mr. Morland! You really must see it.\"\n\nMrs. Grant came towards Elizabeth to take leave, and they stood chatting\ntogether while Colonel Fitzwilliam and Miss Crawford rose and joined\nthem.\n\n\"To-morrow, then, at eleven o'clock, you are sure suits you?\" the\ngentleman was saying. \"Mrs. Grant, your sister has been so kind as to\nsay that, with your permission, I may be her escort on a ride, if a\nhorse can be found that suits her.\"\n\n\"Riding? She will enjoy that,\" said Mrs. Grant, with momentary surprise.\n\"She has not ridden for a long time. We have never tried to get her a\nhorse in Bath.\"\n\nIt seemed that the whole thing had been thought out--all difficulties\ncould be got over, Colonel Fitzwilliam assured her, if she would trust\nher sister to him for an hour or two; and Mary having expressed a proper\namount of amiability and approbation, the arrangement was confirmed.\n\n\"But what about your engagement--the day at Clifton?\" Mrs. Grant\nunluckily remembered, in the midst of the adieux. Colonel Fitzwilliam\nlooked as if he were determined to forget the existence of such a place;\nMr. Darcy reproached himself for having furthered the scheme; and Miss\nCrawford immediately said: \"Oh, pray do not give that up on my account.\nWe can ride another day, if we care about it.\"\n\n\"Not at all, Miss Crawford. Excuse me, but I should not think of giving\nup our plan. It is not at all necessary for me to go to Clifton.\"\n\n\"It would not be fair to make you break a prior engagement. No, let us\nput it off from to-morrow,\" was the lady's response.\n\nElizabeth interposed with, \"If you and Miss Crawford went out a little\nearlier, you could still be at Clifton in time for dinner, Robert, which\nwould quite satisfy my aunt.\"\n\nDarcy joined his advice to his wife's; and as a matter can generally be\neasily arranged by a number of people who are all in favour of it, the\nride was fixed for ten o'clock, and the ladies took their departure\namong many promises of meeting again. James Morland shortly afterwards\nleft, Colonel Fitzwilliam accompanying him as far as his road lay in the\ndirection of the livery stables; and Elizabeth sat down to write\nletters, but she had not got very far before a new idea struck her which\nmust immediately be acted upon. \"Darcy,\" she exclaimed, rising and going\nto her husband, who was occupied with the newspaper, \"can you listen to\nme? I want to help Mr. Morland in some way. I was thinking about it this\nmorning while I was talking to him. He ought to have work to do, and he\nis such a good young fellow. Could you not make him Mr. Ferrars's\ncurate, or something?\"\n\nDarcy smiled at his wife's earnestness. \"You will be surprised to hear,\nmy dear, that I had already thought of helping him.\"\n\n\"You had? How good of you. You can do it better than anyone else. He\nwill be an object worthy of your interest.\"\n\n\"But though I had considered the question of the curacy, I had dismissed\nit as unsatisfactory. Mr. Ferrars does not want a curate, and Mr.\nMorland does want a living. I do not know if I told you that I heard\nbefore I went away that the old Rector of Kympton was likely to resign.\nIf so, I shall have a living to present.\"\n\n\"And did you think of Mr. Morland? How delightful that would be. The\nvery thing for him.\"\n\n\"We must not say anything about it at present, for I cannot hurry the\nold man out; but I expect to hear in the course of a month.\"\n\n\"I am sure you can bring it about successfully. How well everything is\ngoing to-day! Some dreadful catastrophe is sure to happen soon.\"\n\n\"What else has gone well?\"\n\n\"Why, Robert's getting on so excellently with Miss Crawford. She is such\na thoroughly nice woman, and it is certain to do Robert good.\"\n\n\"I would not think too much about that, Lizzy. Robert gets on well with\nall nice women, and as to Miss Crawford, I should say she is accustomed\nto receiving a considerable amount of admiration.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! You shall not spoil my pleasure in it. Why should they not be\nfriends and nothing more? I took care to do him a good turn too; I told\nMrs. Grant the thing I could about him, namely, that he is not well off.\nI knew he would tell them himself, and make the most of it, in that\ndisparaging way he has, as if it were a great blot on his character, or\nsome serious personal defect. He has become so diffident the last few\nmonths that I have no patience with him! He does not value himself\nproperly, and causes people to undervalue him.\"\n\n\"One cannot say that diffidence is a fault of Miss Crawford's other\nadmirer, Sir Walter Elliot.\"\n\n\"No, the tiresome, dressed-up doll! She is so sensible, that I cannot\nunderstand her having those people for her friends.\"\n\n\"Perhaps she has no choice. Possibly the acquaintance was of their\nseeking; she may have made a mistake. Who knows? Even the wisest of us\nmay sometimes be mistaken in our estimates of one another, may we not,\nElizabeth?\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter IV\n\n\nThe ride duly took place on the following morning, and the circumstances\ncaused Elizabeth much secret pleasure. Her husband hesitated to attach\nany importance to the friendship thus inaugurated, and did not care to\nconsider the possibilities arising out of it, for the engagement between\nhis sister and his cousin had been a scheme very near his heart, and\nwhen it failed he was so much disappointed that he could not give up the\nidea of Fitzwilliam's being disappointed too. It was difficult for him\nto imagine that a man who had lost Georgiana could console himself with\nanother woman, however talented and charming. It therefore followed that\nElizabeth was compelled to keep her satisfaction to herself, and being\nvery anxious that nothing should be said to dispel it, she refrained\nfrom giving any account of her cousin when the carriages assembled\nbefore her aunt's door at eleven o'clock. With a warning glance at her\nhusband, she replied to Lady Catherine's peremptory inquiries that\nRobert had an engagement that morning, but he would join them at dinner,\ncoming over on horseback.\n\n\"An engagement!\" repeated Lady Catherine haughtily. \"I was not aware\nthat any engagement could have a prior claim, when my party has been\nmade up for some days. It is very annoying. The result is that you have\nan empty seat in your carriage; if we had known, Captain Tilney's gig\nwould not have been wanted.\"\n\n\"Perhaps Captain Tilney would not mind giving poor little me a seat in\nhis gig,\" suggested Miss Steele, who, since she saw that the honour of\nsharing a back seat with Colonel Fitzwilliam was denied her, had been\nrevolving the next most advantageous plan in her mind. Captain Tilney,\nwho was already in his gig, hoping that his destined companion had not\nyet appeared, looked round for a way of escape: but from Lady\nCatherine's generalship there was none, and she said, after a moment's\nconsideration: \"Very well, I suppose that must do. I had intended--but\nwhen people are so extremely ungrateful--I sent a note round last night\nto Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford, Elizabeth, asking them to join us. They\nactually declined. It is not often that I go out of my way to take\nnotice of strangers--\"\n\n\"My dear aunt,\" interrupted Darcy, \"had we not better start? We are\ncollecting a crowd in the street. Miss Steele, may I help you into the\ngig? I suppose your sister and her husband will go with my aunt and Miss\nde Bourgh. Take care of the wheel. Tilney, your horse looks as if he\nwere going to leave us all behind. Now, Mrs. Ferrars. It is a good thing\nwe have a spare seat, you know, madam. Mr. Morland can take care of the\nbaskets and the wraps. If you like, we can make different arrangement in\ncoming home.\"\n\nThe carriages drove off, and Elizabeth, in the highest spirits,\ncongratulated her husband on his disposal of the Steele faction. The\nparty, however, was not destined to be so successfully divided for the\nwhole day, and while they were all strolling about at Clifton, in the\nhour preceding diner, Elizabeth was taken possession of by her aunt, to\nlisten to some severe strictures upon her management of the family\naffairs.\n\n\"I blame you exceedingly, Elizabeth, for not using your influence with\nFitzwilliam. He ought to go about with the rest of us in an ordinary\nway, not wander off by himself, heaven knows where. _That_ is not the\nway to teach him to forget that affair, which so unfortunately\nmiscarried under your guidance.\"\n\n\"But, Aunt, we cannot control his movements as if he were a child. He\nnaturally goes where he likes and makes his own friends.\"\n\n\"His own friends, yes, indeed! Desirable friends they must be, to cause\nhim to break an engagement with his nearest relations. I think it is\nquite time that he were taken in hand by someone who cares as much for\nhis welfare as I do. Even at his age a man cannot be trusted to know\nwhat is best for himself. I always thought no good would come of it when\nyou and Darcy took so much pains to throw him and Georgiana together.\nYour own family's matrimonial affairs have always been conducted in such\nextraordinary lines--\"\n\n\"We will leave my family out of the discussion, please, Aunt Catherine.\nI do assure you that the breaking of Georgiana's engagement was for the\nbest in every way.\"\n\n\"Of course, I know you feel bound to defend your handiwork, and I am\nonly too glad to think that my dear nephew has not suffered more than he\nhas from the effects. Perhaps next time you will agree that he should be\nguided by the advice of those older and wiser than himself.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Aunt Catherine,\" returned Elizabeth, who only endured these\nremarks by making allowance for her aunt's disappointment. \"Or perhaps\nit might be better to let him choose a wife, if he wants one, entirely\nby himself.\"\n\n\"I should prefer that he should choose one of whom I could approve, and\nthat I could be sure, next time an engagement is made, that it is not\nlikely to be broken,\" returned Lady Catherine. \"When I was a young girl\na betrothal was regarded as a very serious thing, one not lightly to be\ncast aside because of a fancied change of feeling.\"\n\nElizabeth had begun to wonder how much longer she could bear this\nconversation, when the opportune arrival of Colonel Fitzwilliam caused\nhis aunt's attention to be concentrated upon him to the exclusion of\neveryone else; and Elizabeth was pleased to observe his contented air\nand cheerful manner while he laughingly parried his aunt's\ncross-examination, and even submitted to the advances of Miss Steele,\nwho, delighted to find him more approachable than usual, continued to\naddress all her remarks to him while they visited the Pump Room and\nstrolled down towards the river. Elizabeth found herself obliged to pair\noff with Mrs. Ferrars, but Lucy, who possessed a considerably larger\nshare of adroitness than her sister, perceived at once that different\nmethods were necessary to recommend herself to Mrs. Darcy than to Lady\nCatherine, and had for some days been endeavouring to show herself equal\nto the standard of elegance required by a young lady. On this occasion\nshe began by expressing warm enjoyment of the concert a few nights\nbefore.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Elizabeth, \"it was a good concert, very much above the\naverage of those things, I thought.\"\n\n\"Oh, it was charming! I do not know when I have been more delighted!\nThat exquisite Italian song! The air of it runs in my memory still.\"\n\n\"You must have a good memory, for those florid operatic songs are the\nmost difficult things to remember.\"\n\n\"Ah, dear Mrs. Darcy, I fear you undervalue your powers. We all know\nwhat an accomplished musician and critic you are.\" Elizabeth disclaimed;\nbut Mrs. Ferrars continued perseveringly: \"You prefer instrumental\nmusic, perhaps? It is no doubt a sign of a more cultivated taste.\"\n\nElizabeth was somewhat amused. \"I do prefer instrumental music, but only\nbecause it is the kind I understand best.\"\n\n\"Then of course you appreciated the playing of that young lady, Miss\nCrawford. I suppose it was very wonderful. Lady Catherine was much\nstruck by it.\"\n\n\"I do not know that it was wonderful, but Miss Crawford has a great\ngift, and plays with all the feeling and charm one would expect of her.\"\n\n\"You know her well, do you not?\" asked Lucy.\n\n\"Not very well, but I do hope to know her better.\"\n\nLucy meditated upon this: it was not very agreeable news to her; if Mrs.\nDarcy saw much of Miss Crawford, it would mean that Colonel Fitzwilliam\nwould see a good deal of her, too. Lucy felt that after poor Anne's many\nfailures, success did not look more probable here; and the result of her\nreflections was the question: \"Is Miss Crawford as rich as they say?\"\n\n\"I do not know what Miss Crawford's fortune is,\" replied Elizabeth in\ncold surprise. \"She and her sister appear comfortably off.\"\n\n\"Oh, I only meant--\" began Lucy, confused. \"She is said to be such a\ngreat heiress, that I often wonder why she has never married.\" Then, as\nher companion did not speak, she added: \"They say that perhaps she will\nbe the next Lady Elliot, and that would be most suitable, would it not?\n_his_ title and _her_ fortune.\"\n\n\"I should not think such a match was very probable, but I scarcely know\nSir Walter Elliot,\" replied Elizabeth.\n\nLucy could not help pursuing the subject. \"Do you think Miss Crawford\nvery pretty?\" she inquired.\n\n\"She is very graceful and sweet looking; and her face has a great deal\nof animation, which is always so attractive,\" answered Elizabeth.\n\n\"Her complexion has rather lost its bloom, though, and she is so\nunbecomingly thin,\" Lucy ventured to say.\n\n\"I have not remarked it,\" returned Elizabeth, vexed with herself for\nhaving drifted into anything like an intimate conversation with Mrs.\nFerrars. \"Shall we join Lady Catherine? She is evidently wanting to\ncollect the party. It must be nearly time to start for home.\"\n\nLucy saw that she had made a mistake, and covered it as well as she\ncould by saying: \"Oh, but I think Miss Crawford charming, I assure you,\nand so talented. I wish we could have heard the harp when we were\ncalling on you yesterday morning.\"\n\n\"You will have another opportunity of doing so at my aunt's reception\nnext week,\" said her companion.\n\nMrs. Darcy had been quite conscious of the undercurrent in Mrs.\nFerrars's mind during this conversation, for she had perceived the\naspirations of Miss Steele, supported as she was by her sister, towards\nColonel Fitzwilliam; and Elizabeth felt the extreme importance of\npreventing any hint from being dropped which might open her cousin's\neyes to the situation, or even to the fact that anyone thought there was\na situation. A word of raillery from Miss Steele, or of archness from\nMrs. Ferrars, would be enough to drive him from Bath in disgust; he\nwould resent nothing more deeply than the imputation of his paying court\nto an heiress, and persons of the Steele kind, Elizabeth knew, would be\nable to make remarks of a character most difficult for him to bear. The\nfriendship between himself and Miss Crawford was at that time in the\nstage when a very small incident might affect it one way or the other;\nand Elizabeth felt miserably uncomfortable until she found herself\nsafely at home again, and their little party of three collected round\nthe fireside in their lodgings, Mr. Morland having been dropped at his\nrooms.\n\n\"Well, Robert, I did not have the chance to ask you,\" she began, trying\nto speak unconcernedly; \"did you enjoy your ride this morning, and where\ndid you go?\"\n\n\"I enjoyed it very much, thank you,\" replied the Colonel, \"though we did\nnot go far, only about three miles on the Wells road.\"\n\n\"That was a pity,\" said Darcy; \"you ought to have had a good gallop on\nthe downs.\"\n\n\"I wished to do so,\" said the Colonel, \"but I fancied Miss Crawford was\na little disinclined for it. She seemed so much afraid I should be late\nin arriving at Clifton and always talking of turning back.\"\n\n\"You must go farther another time,\" said Elizabeth.\n\n\"Yes, I hope so indeed,\" responded her cousin; \"it is perfect weather\nfor riding, and Miss Crawford is a horsewoman such as one seldom sees.\"\n\n\"Talking of horses, either Tilney is not much of a driver, or else he\ntook pleasure in frightening that Miss Steele to-day,\" remarked Darcy.\n\"You did not see, did you, Robert? No, it was on the way up there. He\nlet his horse gallop down the long hill--I thought the gig would have\nbeen upset--and the silly girl actually caught hold of one rein.\"\n\n\"I thought Miss Steele seemed very unwilling to drive back with him,\"\nsaid Fitzwilliam with a smile. \"By the way, have you noticed what a\nwonderful girl she is for asking questions? She almost equals my aunt.\"\n\nElizabeth felt her fears returning, and inquired: \"Did she manage to\nfind questions to ask _you_, Robert?\"\n\n\"I should think she did. She was trying to extract from me why I had not\narrived earlier and what I had been doing. I had to admit that I had\nbeen riding, and in some way of her own she dragged Miss Crawford's name\nin too. I simply pretended not to hear, and began talking vigorously\nabout something else. How in the world it can matter to her whether I\nwas riding with Miss Crawford, or Miss Anybody, I fail to understand.\"\n\n\"She is an inquisitive little minx, and I cannot bear her,\" Elizabeth\nexclaimed emphatically. \"Fitzwilliam, do let us go home. I don't like\nBath this year, or the people in it. We can ask the nice ones, like Miss\nCrawford and Mr. Morland, to stay with us at Pemberley.\"\n\n\"I am quite willing to return, my dear,\" replied Darcy; \"but it would\nnot do to leave before my aunt's reception, or to admit ourselves driven\naway by a Miss Steele.\"\n\n\"Of course we will stay over the sixteenth, but we will go after that;\nit only means a week or two less than our ordinary visit. The\nWentworths are leaving, and Eleanor Portinscale is too unwell for me to\nsee anything of her, and Aunt Catherine has her extraordinary friends to\namuse her; there is really nothing to keep us. You will come too, will\nyou not, Robert?\"\n\nTo this the Colonel made no reply, and Elizabeth interpreted his silence\nas her wishes dictated.\n\nThe next few days passed without any special event to mark them.\nElizabeth wished more and more to leave Bath, and to be able to persuade\nColonel Fitzwilliam to come too; for she felt an uneasiness that would\nnot be stifled as to the outcome of the various friendships that had\nbeen inaugurated that year. In particular, she suspected the Steele and\nFerrars faction of making some mischief with her aunt; they were\nincessantly with her, and it seemed to Elizabeth that Lady Catherine was\nbecoming what, with all her faults of overbearing pride, haughtiness and\nlove of flattery, she had never been before, namely, suspicious of evil\nmotives and thoughts in those around her. When her nephew and niece were\nwith her she would question them, and hardly accept their explanation of\ntheir occupations at other times; she blamed everybody for what they\nwere doing, Mr. Morland for accepting the hospitality of the\nPortinscales, Lady Portinscale for not entertaining, Captain Tilney for\nnot marrying, Anne Steele for wishing to do so, Colonel Fitzwilliam for\ncoming to Bath, and Georgiana for staying away. Mrs. Grant and Miss\nCrawford were criticized for being in such an expensive place; but on\nthe whole, Lady Catherine said but little about them in a general way,\nwhich Elizabeth regarded as a bad sign, for she was sure, that as\nfriends of _her_ choice, Lady Catherine must have a great deal to say in\nprivate in their disfavour.\n\nAs to James Morland, Elizabeth felt there was everything to be said in\ndefence of his present situation; but she was so anxious for it to be\nknown that he was on the way to obtaining work, that she wanted to be at\nhome, in order to set the necessary arrangements in motion; though her\nhusband laughed at the idea of the vicar's resigning any sooner, because\nthe patron happened to be at Pemberley instead of at Bath.\n\nIt was, however, in regard to the progressing friendship between Mary\nCrawford and Colonel Fitzwilliam that Elizabeth felt most troubled, and\nas long as she remained in Bath, most helpless. Mary and Mrs. Grant\nwould not come and see her more often than she visited them; and\nalthough there were numberless opportunities of meeting at the Rooms,\nthe gardens, the theatre, and other public places, on these occasions\nthere always seemed to be something to interfere with the enjoyment of\ntheir little party. Either Lady Catherine was there, with the Steeles,\nwho could be depended on to break up any rational conversation or other\namusement, or, worse still, Sir Walter and Miss Elliot would appear on\nthe scene, and assuming the privileges of an older acquaintance, would\ntake possession of Mary and draw her away from her newer friends with\nmany protests of \"having been _quite_ deserted--of having so much to say\nto our dear Miss Crawford, whom we have missed so terribly lately.\" They\nhad, of course, a slight previous acquaintance with the Darcys, whom\nthey had intended to become intimate with at one time, as people of\nfashion; but to Miss Elliot's intense chagrin, Mrs. Darcy had been quite\nunresponsive to her, and had instead formed a friendship with her\nyounger sister, Mrs. Wentworth. Although the Wentworths and the Darcys\nwere frequently together, Elizabeth could not well confide her\ndifficulties to Anne, when it was so evident that Sir Walter Elliot was\nanother admirer of Miss Crawford, and not at all evident in which\ndirection the lady's choice would lie! It was hard to believe that she\ncould find true pleasure in the company of Sir Walter, with his tedious\ninanities, or of Miss Elliot, with her artificiality and pride, and yet\nat times she seemed to greet them almost with a heartiness, and be glad\nto join them, even though she might have been a moment before in\nconversation with the Darcy party and showing them her real self in a\ncharming and spontaneous gaiety. But those who watched closely might\nhave noticed that these times coincided with the appearance of Lady\nCatherine, who, on seeing her nephew Colonel Fitzwilliam, usually\nendeavoured to detach him from the group he was in and to join him to\nher own. He, on his part, was always most unwilling to relinquish the\nsociety of Miss Crawford, but she gave him no chance to do otherwise,\ngliding away with a pleasant word of farewell before Lady Catherine's\ninsistent \"I want you, Fitzwilliam, if you can spare me a _few_\nmoments,\" made itself heard. He had no key to her behaviour; sometimes\nit seemed to him as if she really liked him, and as if he might venture\nto hope he could make her like him more; and then, again, Sir Walter\nElliot was so frequently at her elbow, with the compliments and\ngallantries which seemed to be his native language, and were so foreign,\nColonel Fitzwilliam thought, to himself, that, naturally diffident,\ndistrusting his powers to charm and attract, he often felt as if it were\nhopeless even to think of becoming a suitor; while at the same time his\ndeepening love for Mary compelled him to persevere.\n\nElizabeth perceived some part of all this, and longed to help; but there\nwas something about Mary's reserve that made it impossible to win her\nconfidence, or to do anything more for Colonel Fitzwilliam than his own\npowers were able to do for him. Mary never gave him what could be\nconstrued into the smallest encouragement; it was only by observing that\nwith him she seemed to be able to talk more naturally, to express her\nreal opinions more frankly, that Elizabeth could surmise his interest in\nher to be in the slightest degree reciprocated. Had it not been for the\nvery strong liking Elizabeth had formed for her new friend, she would\nhave been disposed to think that her cousin's happiness would best be\nfurthered by separating him from a pleasure that might become such great\npain. But after a conversation with him, in which he briefly admitted\nhis growing attachment and the existence of his hopes, she could not\nadvise him to give up the quest, and could only assure him of her\nsympathy and belief in Mary's being a prize worth winning. He confessed\nthat he felt it was doing a wrong to Georgiana to indulge in such\nthoughts so short a time after leaving her, and reproached himself with\nhis presumption in thinking that so brilliant and admired creature as\nMary could have any warmth of feeling for \"a battered old soldier like\nthis,\" as he styled himself. Elizabeth tried to reason him out of these\nscruples, and to give him all the good counsel that her knowledge of his\ncharacter suggested. She found that he did not believe he had at present\nthe remotest chance of being accepted; he only hoped, while they\nremained in Bath, to win his way in Miss Crawford's esteem, and to be\nassured that she had no preference for any other man.\n\n\n\n\nChapter V\n\n\nElizabeth was anxious to see as much of Miss Crawford as possible before\ntheir departure from Bath, which was now fixed for the 17th of April,\nthe day after Lady Catherine's reception. She accordingly made an excuse\nto walk down to Mrs. Grant's house on the day before with the piece of\nmusic, which it had occurred to her might be arranged with a setting for\nthe harp; and she found Miss Crawford in and alone. Mary was wearing her\nbonnet and cloak and was wrapping up a parcel when Mrs. Darcy was\nannounced; and the latter exclaimed that she would not stay, as Mary was\njust going out.\n\n\"No, no, I am not--it does not matter--I was only going to take this\nparcel to Miss Elliot's--pray sit down, Mrs. Darcy--I can send it by the\nboy\"; and recalling the servant, Miss Crawford handed him the package\nwith directions to take it to Camden Place. Then returning, she threw\noff her cloak and said: \"It really does not signify in the least; it is\nonly a fan Miss Elliot lent me a few evenings ago--as an excuse, she\nsaid, for seeing me again when I brought it back.\" This was spoken with\na slight blush, but on Elizabeth's repeating her regrets she exclaimed:\n\"Oh, but I would much rather stay and talk to you. I so seldom see you\nalone; one seldom does see anyone alone in Bath, I think. What have you\nbrought? Some music? How delightful! You will play it to me now.\"\n\nElizabeth explained her scheme, and Miss Crawford examined the piece\nwith great interest, and presently declared she thought it would make an\nadmirable duet. As she walked across the room to the harp, Elizabeth\nremarked: \"If you like it, we might play it to-morrow night at my aunt's\nreception.\"\n\nMiss Crawford appeared to be busily tuning the strings of her harp, and\nit was after a moment's pause that she replied: \"I do not think we shall\nbe at Lady Catherine's reception.\"\n\n\"Not be there!\" repeated Elizabeth, concealing her dismay as best she\ncould. \"I am very sorry for that; we shall all be sorry not to see you\nthere.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" returned Miss Crawford, and seemed unwilling to say more.\nElizabeth, however, could not bear to leave the subject at that point,\nand after a few moments suggested that if Mrs. Grant did not feel equal\nto going, she herself would be delighted to call for Miss Crawford and\ntake her to Pulteney Street.\n\n\"You are very kind, Mrs. Darcy, but it is not that,\" said Miss Crawford,\nat length turning round and showing a countenance expressive of some\nembarrassment. \"The truth is,\" she continued, \"and I know I can speak it\nto a friend like yourself, that I don't think Lady Catherine really\nwants such very small rushlights as ourselves in her firmament of\nglittering stars. She cannot be said to know us; she has not called here\nsince I was introduced to her at that concert, and only sent us a note\nlate one evening asking us to come next day to Clifton. I do not in the\nleast mind being invited only on account of my music, but, as Frances\nand I always agree, since I am not paid in money, I must be in manners.\nOh! I beg your pardon--\" she stopped short, colouring and biting her\nlip--\"I should not have said that. Lady Catherine has, of course, a\nperfect right to do as she likes. I daresay she has long forgotten\nhaving given me an invitation.\"\n\n\"My dear Miss Crawford,\" exclaimed Elizabeth, whose colour had also\nrisen, \"say no more; you quite put us all to shame. Was there ever such\nan ill-mannered family? Of course, I thought that my aunt had sent you\nand your sister an invitation in due form. You must let me take all the\nblame to myself, for having omitted to remind her; we had talked, we had\nassumed all this time that you would be at the reception, which must\naccount for my unpardonable forgetfulness of what should have been an\nearly and most pleasurable duty.\"\n\nMiss Crawford tried to laugh the matter off by saying that it was in no\nrespect Mrs. Darcy's fault, and that the whole thing was too trifling to\ndeserve a moment's consideration; besides, she added, Mrs. Darcy had\npresented her sister to Lady Catherine on one occasion, and could not\nhave done more; that she was sure she and Mrs. Grant would not be missed\nat such a large party, and that she hoped to have other opportunities of\nmeeting Mr. and Mrs. Darcy.\n\n\"It is because I fear there will be so few more in Bath, owing to our\ndeparture for home, that I am so particularly sorry to lose this one,\nand also for the cause of it,\" returned Elizabeth. \"I can quite enter\ninto your feelings, Miss Crawford, but will you do a very kind and\ngenerous thing, and show that you have forgiven me by availing yourself\nof my aunt's invitation if she tenders it in a manner you can accept?\"\n\nMiss Crawford could not be persuaded to give a definite assent to this\nproposal; she tried to treat the matter of her going to the party or\nstaying away as no consequence, and laughingly protested that she would\nsend the harp alone, which would answer all purposes as far as Lady\nCatherine was concerned. The utmost she could be induced to say was: \"I\nshould be very glad to give _you_ the pleasure\"; and with this Elizabeth\nwas obliged to be content. Nevertheless, Elizabeth was so extremely\ndesirous of securing Miss Crawford's presence, partly in the hope that\nLady Catherine might be more kindly disposed to her on a closer\nacquaintance, and partly in order that Colonel Fitzwilliam might be\nenabled to enjoy her company without fear of interruption from the\nElliots, that on leaving Mrs. Grant's house she hastened at once to\nPulteney Street, trusting to find Lady Catherine alone and disposed to\nlisten to her errand. In both these objects she was successful; for\nthough the inevitable Miss Steele was in the house, she was upstairs\nwith Miss de Bourgh, and Lady Catherine having just had a disappointment\nin hearing that some old friends found themselves obliged to quit Bath\nbefore her reception, was in a mood to demand Elizabeth's sympathy and\nto discuss matters connected with entertainment.\n\n\"It really is exceedingly trying,\" she said. \"I am not prepared for\nthese annoyances. At my age my friends should take care to spare me\nthem. I am convinced that Lady Alicia Markham's son is not so ill but\nthat he could have done without his mother for another two days.\"\n\nElizabeth condoled warmly, and listened to a description of the\narrangements for the evening, in which, it appeared, Mrs. Ferrars's\nhelp had been invaluable; and when Lady Catherine named the musicians\nshe expected, Elizabeth took advantage of the opening thus afforded her,\nby suggesting that a more formal invitation should be sent to Miss\nCrawford, to ensure her presence.\n\nLady Catherine stared, and in a tone of offended surprise reminded her\nof the first meeting with Miss Crawford. \"You were present, I recollect,\nElizabeth, when she was introduced to me, and I gave her the opportunity\nof bringing her instrument on this occasion.\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember its being mentioned,\" said Elizabeth, \"but I hardly\nthink she took it as an invitation. I fancied you meant to follow it up\nby calling on her and her sister.\"\n\n\"I may have had some thoughts of doing so,\" returned Lady Catherine\nhaughtily; \"but in the end I decided that I did not choose it; I cannot\ntake up with all the new young ladies who come to Bath, and least of all\nthose who are talked of as much as she is. She is the greatest flirt\nimaginable: that foolish old beau, Sir Walter Elliot, and half the men\nof Bath are running after her.\"\n\n\"No, indeed, dear madam; you have been misinformed, and I must defend\nher,\" said Elizabeth with more earnestness. \"She is not in the least a\nflirt, and though men may run after her, they receive no encouragement\nto do so. But if you do not like her, there is no more to be said. Now,\nwhom could you get in her place? I do not know any other lady, but there\nis a man at the theatre who is said to play the harp tolerably well.\"\n\nLady Catherine was silent for a moment with anger; then she broke out,\nas Elizabeth had expected: \"There is no one I can get in her place. The\nimpudent girl! She should be glad to come to a house like this. Probably\nshe is intending to come all the time, if the truth were known; how can\nyou tell she is not?\"\n\n\"Only that when I last saw her she distinctly said that she and her\nsister had no reason to think themselves expected.\"\n\n\"No reason! when with my own mouth I said, 'I should like you to come\nand play at my house on the sixteenth.' Nothing could be clearer. As to\nher sister, if that is the very ordinary-looking person whom I believe\nyou presented to me one morning, no, I do not recollect saying anything\nto her; but it is not she who plays the harp.\"\n\n\"She is a very agreeable and cultured woman, widow of a Canon of\nWestminster, and Miss Crawford goes nowhere without her.\"\n\n\"Well, it is all extremely annoying, and I do not know when I have been\nso upset. You should have told her, Elizabeth, told her plainly that she\nwas to come. Really, the airs these people give themselves! Here is a\ncard; I will write their names and send it round this afternoon, and I\nhope after that we shall have no more nonsense.\"\n\nThis by no means satisfied Elizabeth, and the next ten minutes were\nspent by her in using every means of persuasion she could think of to\ninduce her aunt to repair all previous omissions by going to visit Mrs.\nGrant and conveying her invitation in person. Lady Catherine at first\nresisted the proposal indignantly, and would have continued to do so but\nfor her knowledge that Miss Crawford's music was to have been an\nattractive part of the evening's entertainment, and an uncomfortable\nrecollection of having told many of her friends that they would hear a\nperson scarcely known, in whom she had discovered some remarkable\ntalent.\n\nThis she did not betray to her niece, and when the latter left the house\nit was without having secured a definite promise, but Elizabeth felt\nshe had said as much as she safely could, and she walked home, pondering\non what had passed, and wondering uneasily whether what she had done had\nbeen a real kindness to Mary. This question was also raised by her\nhusband, to whom she had related the affair on her return. He shook his\nhead over it, and gave it as his opinion that as his aunt had been rude\nto Miss Crawford, and the latter was fully conscious of it, they would\nnot meet in a spirit conducive to future good feeling.\n\n\"But it would have been worse,\" said Elizabeth, \"if Aunt Catherine had\ncounted on Miss Crawford's coming and she had not appeared. There would\nhave been no healing the breach then.\"\n\n\"Would it have greatly signified if there had been a breach?\" inquired\nDarcy. \"But never mind, my dear, you have done your best, and it will be\ninteresting to see the result of Aunt Catherine's efforts at\nconciliation--the first time she has ever appeared in such a role, I\nshould think.\"\n\nStrangely enough, Lady Catherine's efforts were successful enough,\nalthough no one ever knew precisely how she accomplished it. But it was\npartly accounted for by the fact that she saw Mrs. Grant alone, Miss\nCrawford being out. She had taken only her daughter with her, not\nchoosing that Miss Steele should be a witness of an interview which was\nundoubtedly galling to her pride; and Mrs. Grant, realizing but a small\npart of the great lady's insolence towards her sister, and the nature of\nMary's resentment of it, only perceived that Lady Catherine was anxious\nto have them at the party, and was willing to acknowledge any remissness\nin her manner of issuing the invitation. Lady Catherine was so relieved\nat not having to apologize directly to the object of her dislike, that\nshe became, in the course of the interview, more and more\ncondescendingly gracious to Mrs. Grant, whom she found, as she\nafterwards remarked to her daughter, an amiable, unpretentious person;\nand actually admitted that she ought to have called sooner, but the\npressure of engagements in Bath at this period of the season was so\ngreat. The call was strictly limited to a quarter of an hour, and Mrs.\nGrant described it all to Mary when she came in with much spirit and\nhumour.\n\nMary, on hearing that her sister had actually accepted, was inclined to\nbe defiant, and to declare that she would have a headache and not go; of\ncourse it was kind Mrs. Darcy's doing, but she did not care to accept\nfavours thrown at her at the eleventh hour like this, by ill-tempered\nold ladies who only wanted to make use of her. Mrs. Grant, whose pride\nin, and love of, her sister were unbounded, and who delighted in seeing\nher shine by means of her beauty and talents, had great difficulty in\npersuading her; in fact, when they met the Darcy party at the Lower\nRooms the following morning, Mary still declared that her coming was so\ndoubtful that it was not worth while to give Mrs. Darcy the trouble of\nlearning the duet.\n\nElizabeth, however, felt fairly confident of seeing her there, and\nColonel Fitzwilliam confirmed this by telling Elizabeth with a cheerful\nglance that \"she had not actually said she would not go.\" Their hopes\nwere realized by the arrival of the two sisters, Mary looking lovely and\nsparkling in white with a few fine jewels, the gifts of her devoted\nbrother. Elizabeth, who had arrived some time earlier, happened to be\nnear her aunt, and so was able to satisfy herself that their reception\nby their hostess was properly courteous, if not cordial. Lady Catherine\neven took the trouble to mention the name of her daughter, who stood\nclose by, and Miss de Bourgh actually exerted herself so far as to make\ntwo separate curtsies, though the remark that it was a cold evening was\ntaken out of her mouth by Anne Steele, who was standing next to her, and\nevidently considered herself included in the introduction.\n\nElizabeth saw with delight that Colonel Fitzwilliam was impatiently\nawaiting his turn after these formalities should be over, and that he\nimmediately placed himself by Miss Crawford's side. They seemed to have\nmuch to say to one another; and Elizabeth, after greeting the two\nladies, and giving Mary an expressive glance of gratitude which conveyed\nmuch more than her quiet remark: \"It was kind of you to come,\" began to\nconverse with Mrs. Grant until music should be demanded of Mary.\n\nElizabeth was very well amused in watching the arrival of the guests,\nand in noticing which of them were under the special patronage of the\nRobert Ferrars, who appeared to have brought into Lady Catherine's\ncircle a number of individuals of about the same standing in the world\nof fashion as themselves. Robert Ferrars was in his element, as though\nhe found entertaining in another person's house a much more satisfactory\nmatter than when the trouble and expense had to be incurred by himself,\nbesides having the advantage of being able to introduce his friends to\nan earl's daughter as their hostess. When all who were expected had\narrived, he, in company with a showy-looking young man, dressed in the\nextreme of fashion, began strolling about the rooms in search of someone\nupon whom they could make an impression. Elizabeth thought that she and\nher husband might at least have escaped Mr. Ferrars's civilities; and\ngreat was her surprise when the young men paused before her, and Mr.\nFerrars begged leave to introduce his friend Mr. Yates, who had newly\ncome from London. Mr. and Mrs. Darcy, he thought, might be interested to\nmeet Mr. Yates, in view of their intended journey, as Mr. Yates would be\nable to give them all information as to the state of the roads.\n\nMrs. Darcy had scarcely made her curtsey and was about to frame some\nsuitable reply, when the glance of the newcomer happened to fall on Mrs.\nGrant, who was seated on a low chair close by. He immediately pronounced\nher name in tones of questioning surprise, and when she looked up,\nexclaimed: \"Yes, I was sure it was. Upon my word, madam, I take some\ncredit to myself, considering the length of time it is since we met. I\nhope I am so fortunate as to recall myself to your remembrance?\"\n\n\"You are very good, sir,\" replied Mrs. Grant, with a perceptible effort.\nHer countenance expressed no great pleasure at the encounter. \"Of\ncourse, I recall you perfectly. Mrs. Yates, I trust, is quite well.\"\n\n\"Very well, I thank you, madam; and I hope the same may be said of your\nfair sister, Miss Crawford--but perhaps she is no longer Miss Crawford?\"\n\n\"Don't be under any alarm, Yates,\" struck in Robert Ferrars; \"she is\nstill Miss Crawford, and you can judge for yourself how well she is, for\nyou will see and hear her to-night.\"\n\nThis speech was so offensive to Mrs. Grant that she cut short Mr.\nYates's compliments, and remarking, \"Yes, I am glad to say my sister is\nstill with me,\" rose and prepared to move away. Elizabeth immediately\nsuggested that they should go in search of some tea, and the dismayed\nMr. Yates saw Mrs. Darcy departing before he had uttered a single word\nabout London, or about the distinguished people he had dined with the\nnight before last.\n\n\"Well, I'm very sorry, Ferrars,\" he replied to his friend's reproaches;\n\"I'm sure I didn't want to talk to Mrs. Grant at all, but seeing her was\nthe greatest surprise; I never dreamt of meeting her here, and, of\ncourse, I had to speak a civil word, or she would have thought it so\nstrange.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" retorted Ferrars, \"what on earth did that matter? I\nshould have thought you would understand that Mrs. Darcy is the person\nto make yourself agreeable to here, not Mrs. Grant, who is only a\nclergyman's widow. I suppose, as you knew her before, that she lived\ndown at that precious dull place in the country, where you took your\nwife from.\"\n\n\"Yes, she did,\" answered Mr. Yates; \"but there's a good deal more in it\nthan that--not through her. Do you mean to say that sister of hers is\nreally here, going about in Bath?\"\n\n\"Of course she goes about; why shouldn't she?\" demanded Ferrars. \"Is\nthere anything against it? The women are all down on her, I know--you\nshould hear my wife and sister--but only because she's such a devilish\npretty girl and proud; she won't have any friends but the Darcys.\"\n\n\"But do you actually not know? Have you never heard all about her and\nher brother? Between the two of them they managed to lead my wife's\nfamily a pretty dance. Neither of them can ever show their faces in\nMansfield again, so it was a lucky thing the Grants moved when they did.\nTo think of meeting Miss Crawford again! I shall tell her that Edmund\nBertram is uncommonly well and prosperous, and Tom Bertram isn't married\nyet; and you see how she looks when I do it.\"\n\nThis amiable intention was frustrated, as Elizabeth, who could readily\nsee that Mrs. Grant was disturbed by what had happened, did not need\neven the hint dropped by her that she hoped Mary would not meet Mr.\nYates, as he was connected with the Bertrams, and all that part of her\nlife that it was painful to her to remember, in order to make her strive\nin every way to protect Mary from any disagreeableness. They went to the\ntea-room, whither Colonel Fitzwilliam and Mary had, fortunately,\npreceded them some time before Mr. Yates's appearance. They were there\njoined by Darcy, and all five formed a happily conversing group. Mrs.\nGrant whispered a word to her sister, whose countenance changed for a\nmoment; but she shook off the cloud and gave herself up to the delight\nof the present. Once Elizabeth received a message from her aunt\nrequesting her to \"make Miss Crawford play now,\" and she escorted her\nfriend back to the music-room and did not leave her after the\nperformance until she saw Colonel Fitzwilliam safely stationed beside\nher. No command to play a second time followed, rather to Elizabeth's\nsurprise, but having a number of friends to take leave of, she could not\ngive it much thought before her own departure, which her husband had\ninsisted should be an early one, in view of the journey on the following\nday.\n\nMr. Yates did not, in fact, come near any of this little party during\nthe rest of the evening, but might have been observed conversing\nearnestly in a quiet part of the room with Lucy Ferrars and her sister,\nwho, judging by their rapt attention and animated countenances, found\nwhat Mr. Yates had to say deeply interesting; so much so, in fact, that\nwhen his narration was finished the two young women, having faithfully\npromised to repeat no word of what he had told them, took the first\nopportunity of slipping away unostentatiously in the direction of their\nhostess; and having drawn her aside, with a hint of having something\nvery important to communicate, poured into her ears that whole story\njust heard, a story which, as may be imagined, lost nothing in their\nversion of it. Lady Catherine was so exceedingly angry that her\ninstantly expressed desire was to have both Mr. Yates and Miss\nCrawford--the latter being, of course, the heroine of his tale--brought\nbefore her, with some confused idea in her mind of proving to the world\nat large that her dislike of Mary Crawford had all the time been well\nfounded; but Lucy's extreme terror of the consequences of this act and\nher part in it, while Mr. and Mrs. Darcy were there to protect their\nfriend, caused her to implore Lady Catherine to suspend pronouncing\njudgment till the following day. There would still be plenty of\nopportunities of meeting Miss Crawford, Lucy assured her patroness. Lady\nCatherine would make no promises. Only the necessity of attending to her\nother guests, she replied, delayed her from informing Miss Crawford of\nher strong disapproval. She would not appear to condone such conduct as\nMiss Crawford's had been one moment longer than she could help. Lucy and\nher sister thought it safest to mingle inconspicuously with the crowd\nuntil the storm should break over some other heads.\n\nMeantime, Elizabeth and her husband had made their farewells to most of\ntheir friends, and were exchanging a few last words with Mrs. Grant and\nMary. The latter looked unusually lovely, and an expression of quiet\nhappiness illumined her countenance. Colonel Fitzwilliam did not allow\nhimself yet to adopt the easy manner of an intimate friend, but the\nearnestness of his glance towards Mary, the eagerness with which he\nobeyed her slightest request, betrayed the state of his feelings, and\nhis air and manner were those of a man whose thoughts are wholly\npleasant.\n\n\"I am so sorry that this is really good-bye,\" Elizabeth was saying, \"but\nI am consoled by thinking it is only for a little while. You will keep\nyour promise and come to us this summer, will you not?\" Mary Crawford\nand her sister repeated a cordial acceptance, and the former added: \"You\nmust tell us exactly how to come, Mrs. Darcy, you must explain all the\nintricacies of travelling between Brighton and Derbyshire, or we shall\nundoubtedly be lost on the road.\"\n\n\"Brighton! Shall you come from there?\" and it was explained that the\nladies generally spent the months of June and July at some seaside\nplace, and Brighton had been thought of for this year. \"Or we may be in\nLondon with my brother,\" continued Mary, \"but wherever we are, if you\nremember to ask us, we shall come.\"\n\nThe usual protestations of the impossibility of forgetting followed, and\nvery warm handshakes were exchanged; then Elizabeth, turning to her\ncousin, said: \"Are you coming home now, Robert? It will be most\nunfriendly of you not to, for how else shall we see you again, since you\npositively decline to go with us to-morrow?\"\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam hesitated, and said he had not thought of going home\njust yet; but Mary interrupted him by saying: \"Pray don't let us keep\nyou, Colonel Fitzwilliam. I am sure our coach will be there now, if you\nwould kindly inquire. Colonel Fitzwilliam was so kind as to wish to put\nus into our coach,\" she added to Elizabeth, \"but it would not be worth\nwhile, just for that, to prevent him from driving home with you and Mr.\nDarcy.\"\n\n\"I will go and see, certainly,\" said the Colonel, moving off; \"but\ndon't wait for me, Elizabeth. I would just as soon walk back, and I will\nsee you and Darcy at breakfast.\"\n\nDarcy drew his wife's arm within his, and they made their way to Lady\nCatherine, who was sitting very upright in an armchair and wearing her\nmost stern and forbidding expression. To Elizabeth's civilly-worded\nthanks for all the kindness and pleasure which their aunt had bestowed\non her relatives during their stay, she made no reply; but when\nElizabeth referred to their departure on the morrow, she started, placed\nher hand coldly within her niece's for a moment, and said: \"Yes, you are\ngoing, I recollect. You did not consult me in the matter, but still,\nperhaps this year it is as well you are not staying longer.\"\n\nElizabeth was too well accustomed to her aunt's insolent speeches to\nseek to account for them, and turned away; while Darcy, remarking, \"Yes,\nwe have stayed as long as we care to for this year,\" also shook hands\nwith his aunt, cutting her rather short in the midst of a statement that\nshe could send no message to Georgiana, and without further delay\nescorted his wife downstairs.\n\nMary Crawford watched them from the room, and then said to Mrs. Grant:\n\"Let us go and say good-night also, Frances. We may as well be\nready--and there will be the harp to be carried down.\"\n\n\"Very well, my dear,\" returned her sister. \"We shall have to take our\nturn, for everyone else seems to be preparing to leave at once.\"\n\nThey approached Lady Catherine, and when after a few minutes they\nreached her side, to their surprise she addressed them in a more stiff\nand stately manner than usual. \"Ah! Miss Crawford! I was awaiting you.\nWill you kindly come this way?\" And she preceded them towards a small\nlibrary, where card-tables had been placed, but which was now deserted.\n\nMary was not the least apprehensive of harm, and even whispered\nmischievously to her sister: \"Perhaps she is going to present me with a\nfee!\" so that her astonishment was unbounded when Lady Catherine, having\nclosed the door, turned to her and exclaimed in a voice shrill with\nanger, which she did not attempt to control: \"As this is probably the\nlast time we shall meet, Miss Crawford, you will allow me to inform you\nthat I have been entirely under a misapprehension in inviting you to my\nhouse, and that I very much regret having done so.\" The two sisters\ngazed at her, both silent from surprise, and Lady Catherine made haste\nto continue: \"I see you are on the point of asking me what reason I have\nfor coming to this conclusion. I do not care to enter into particulars;\nit must be sufficient for you that facts have come to my\nknowledge--facts which, if you search your memory, will no doubt--\"\n\nMary had by now found words, and she broke into Lady Catherine's speech\nin a voice that distress and wounded dignity caused to tremble: \"I was\nnot on the point of asking you why you propose to forbid me your house.\nIn that matter my decision had anticipated your wishes. But I have a\nright to ask the meaning of this insult; even your ladyship will hardly\nrefuse to inform me of what and by whom I am accused.\"\n\nLady Catherine drew herself up still further, and said: \"I repeat that I\ndo not care to enter into particulars. I have no wish to say anything\nthat may be injurious to you in your future life. The facts which have\ncome to my knowledge are facts which you must be well aware are damaging\nto yourself and any member of your family--only in a lesser degree to\nyou, Mrs. Grant. I shall repeat them to no one. I only wish you to\nunderstand our acquaintance is henceforth at an end.\"\n\nMary scarcely heard the last words; she had turned to her sister, who\nseemed quite overwhelmed and could only say, almost indistinguishably:\n\"That dreadful Mr. Yates! I feared--I feared--\"\n\n\"Frances, dear Frances, do not give way, I implore you. Do not let her\nmake you unhappy. What does it matter about Mr. Yates? The truth cannot\nharm either of us.\" Then, confronting Lady Catherine once more, with\nhead proudly thrown back, she demanded: \"Now, madam, in justice to my\nsister, if not to me, will you kindly state what Mr. Yates has told\nyou?\"\n\nLady Catherine, who had expected a shamefaced attitude, was unprepared\nfor this counter-attack, and replied after some hesitation: \"It is\nevident that you know Mr. Yates has something to tell.\"\n\n\"Certainly, we know exactly what Mr. Yates knows,\" retorted Mary with\nspirit, \"but what he may have told your ladyship is quite another\nmatter. Will you tell us, or are you disposed to wait for the presence\nof Mr. and Mrs. Darcy? A message from us would cause them to postpone\ntheir journey to-morrow.\"\n\nThe taunt was a well-judged one; Lady Catherine felt its truth, and\nanxious not to involve herself more deeply, she exclaimed: \"Mr. Yates\nhas not spoken on the subject to me; it is sufficient for me that he has\ntold others, upon whom I can rely, the whole story of your brother's\ndisgraced connection with that married woman, with whose dishonoured\nname I will not sully my lips--is that the true, or is it not? You say\nthe truth can do you no harm.\"\n\n\"The fact is true,\" replied Mary, who had grown very white.\n\n\"Oh, Mary, Mary!\" exclaimed Mrs. Grant, \"let us come away now that we\nknow the worst.\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Mary, who was retaining her calmness by a great effort,\n\"we will not deprive Lady Catherine of the pleasure of telling all she\nhas heard.\"\n\n\"And you express no contrition, you shameless, you bad-hearted girl?\"\nbroke out Lady Catherine, giving rein to her anger. \"You think it can do\nyou no harm to have all known of that shocking affair, which alone\nshould make you shun the society of respectable persons, but beyond and\nabove all that, there are your own intrigues with the two brothers of\nthat wretched woman, one of whom you enticed away from the girl to whom\nhe was attached, and your own flirtations here, which I will not enter\ninto, but which I have watched taking place under my very eyes--\"\n\n\"That will do, I think,\" said Mary, raising her hand. \"You can have\nnothing further to say. You have insulted us in every possible manner. I\nonly hope, Lady Catherine, that by this outrage you will consider\nyourself to have taken ample revenge.\"\n\n\"How dare you speak so to my poor sister?\" demanded Mrs. Grant, wrath at\nlast overmastering her distress. \"If you only knew the real truth of the\nmatter--if you only knew who had suffered and who was to be blamed!--God\nforgive you your wicked thoughts and your poisonous tongue!\"\n\n\"Hush, hush, Frances!\" interposed Mary, drawing her sister away. \"Do not\ntry to convince her. She is not worth it,\" and the two sisters left the\nroom and walked with fairly firm steps downstairs, where they procured\ntheir cloaks, and Mrs. Grant was able, by drawing down her hood, to\nconceal the traces of her emotion. Mary directed a servant to bring her\ninstrument downstairs, and they awaited it within the cloak-room. A few\nminutes later the servant knocked at the door, asking for Miss\nCrawford, and both ladies hastened forward, expecting the announcement\nof their coach, but Mary drew back on encountering the pale and anxious\ngaze of Colonel Fitzwilliam, and hearing his eager words: \"I feared I\nhad missed you--that you had gone--I searched for you through the\nrooms--and then I heard you were with my aunt. Is anything the matter,\ndear Miss Crawford? I fear there is something.\"\n\n\"It is of no consequence, thank you, Colonel Fitzwilliam,\" she replied,\nspeaking with cold pride. \"You are come a little too late to be of any\nassistance. I see the footman has brought my harp, so if you will kindly\nallow us to leave the house, that is the most you can do.\"\n\n\"I implore you not to speak so, dearest Miss Crawford,\" he exclaimed,\nthough keeping his voice low on account of the persons standing round.\n\"Is there nothing I can do, nothing I can put right? I could, I am sure,\nif only I knew what had happened.\"\n\n\"Lady Catherine can best inform you of that,\" returned Mary in icy tones.\n\"May I again request that you will ask for our carriage?\"\n\n\"One moment only, and I will not detain you,\" he said hurriedly. \"May I\ncall on you to-morrow, at an early hour? Pray give me permission.\"\n\n\"I shall not be at home to-morrow,\" answered Mary, and swept proudly\npast him towards the front door, where a footman had just announced:\n\"Mrs. Grant's carriage stops the way.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Grant!\" exclaimed Colonel Fitzwilliam, placing himself beside that\nlady as she followed her sister, \"you will allow me to come and see you?\nI will not torment your sister, but--you will not close your door on me\nwithout at least explaining the reason for this dreadful change?\"\n\n\"Oh, Colonel Fitzwilliam!\" exclaimed Mrs. Grant, with difficulty\ncontrolling her agitation, \"if you knew all, you would not expect me to\nreceive you; but I cannot altogether refuse, only I must have time to\nreflect, to consider--and my sister must be my first care.\"\n\nHe could only bow and acquiesce; and he assisted her into the carriage,\nwhich immediately rolled away.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VI\n\n\nMr. and Mrs. Darcy were dismayed at the haggard aspect of their cousin\nwhen he joined them at breakfast the next morning. He looked like a man\nwho had not slept, and whose wakefulness had some distressing cause. To\ntheir inquiries he replied by giving as brief and quiet an account as he\ncould of the incident of the preceding evening. Elizabeth exclaimed with\nconsternation when he described Miss Crawford's manner to him at the\ndoor, but refrained from making any comment until he had related how he\nhad gone in search of his aunt, to obtain, if possible, an explanation\nfrom her. He had had to wait some time, until all but one or two of the\nguests had gone and he could be alone with her, but she had been most\ndifficult to talk to on the subject; when reproached with her treatment\nof Miss Crawford and Mrs. Grant, she had admitted that perhaps she did\nspeak rather severely to Miss Crawford, but the latter's attitude had\nannoyed her; that everything she had said was fully justified, and she\nwas perfectly convinced that Miss Crawford was a most undesirable\nperson, and one she should never have had in her house.\n\n\"Good heavens! can such things be said without impunity?\" exclaimed\nElizabeth. \"What did you say, Robert?\"\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam replied that he hoped he had controlled his temper,\nbut it had been no easy matter. His aunt would not even substantiate her\ncharges, and only referred to the shocking conduct of Miss Crawford and\nher brother towards a family called Bertram, adding that though this\ninformation had only just come to her ears, she believed that in London\nit was common property. Needless to say, her nephew's assurances that\nwhatever the brother might have done Miss Crawford herself was\nabsolutely innocent of any wrongdoing whatever, had not the slightest\neffect. Neither was she able to perceive that upon no basis but a shred\nof vulgar gossip she had done a vile thing in attacking and defaming two\nguests under her own roof.\n\n\"That made her more enraged than ever,\" continued Colonel Fitzwilliam;\n\"she said it was not vulgar gossip, but a well-founded fact; and though\nshe evidently was under a promise not to reveal the source of her\nknowledge, the word Ferrars slipped out once, so I was assured of what\nin fact I had guessed before, namely, to whom we owe this whole\nabominable affair.\"\n\n\"It is most deplorable,\" said Darcy gravely. \"We can never regret it\nenough. I am sorry for you, Fitzwilliam, and still more sorry for Mrs.\nGrant and her sister, but I do not see that there is anything to be\ndone, beyond apologies from all who are in any way connected with my\naunt. It must be talked of as little as possible, for Miss Crawford's\nsake. The Ferrars will do their mischievous part; and it must be the\nduty of her friends to take it for granted and ignore it; there is a\nmodicum of truth in the story, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I do not know, or wish to know, anything about it,\" began Fitzwilliam,\nbut Elizabeth interposed eagerly: \"I can tell you all there is to know.\nI heard the story, if you can call it so, from Anne Wentworth only the\nother day: but I did not mention it again, for there is no use in\nreviving these things. It is true that Miss Crawford's brother ran away\nwith Mrs. Rushworth, who had been Miss Bertram. He had treated her very\nbadly before her marriage, gaining her affections and then showing her\nhe did not intend to marry her. Mary Crawford had been on terms of\nfriendship with the whole family, and one of the brothers, a young\nBertram, had paid her attention. Naturally, the scandal of the divorce\nseparated the two families; and I suppose ill-natured people can find\nsome reason why Mary should be blamed for it, but I know of none.\"\n\n\"How came Mrs. Wentworth to be acquainted with these events?\" asked\nDarcy. Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed to pay little heed; he rose from the\ntable, leaving his untasted breakfast.\n\n\"Because they have a great friend, a naval officer, young Lieutenant\nPrice, who is also connected with the Bertrams; his sister married one\nof the sons. In fact, she was adopted by the family as a child, and\nwould naturally know all its affairs. I suppose the Ferrars got their\ninformation from that Mr. Yates who was there last night; I do not know\nanything about him, but I will ask Anne Wentworth.\"\n\n\"You know my advice, which is, as little said as possible,\" was Darcy's\nreply; and he crossed to the window, to lay his hand on his cousin's\nshoulder, and say warmly: \"Do not take it too much to heart, my dear\nfellow. On reflection, Miss Crawford, when she is a little less upset,\nwill see that you are not to blame, and Mrs. Grant, who is evidently a\nsensible woman, will take the right line when she has had time to think\nthings over.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" returned Colonel Fitzwilliam; but very little hope was\nexpressed in his voice or bearing.\n\n\"I wish we could stay another day or two, to do some good in this\nmiserable business,\" exclaimed Elizabeth. \"We might even now put off\nstarting.\"\n\n\"No, Elizabeth, we could hardly do that, and it would not be advisable,\"\nsaid Darcy, with decision. \"None of us could make my aunt's peace with\nthese ladies; and if we have to make our own, as well as Robert his, we\ncan do it better by letter. By the way, Robert, how do you stand with my\naunt?\"\n\n\"We parted in anger, I fear,\" replied Fitzwilliam; \"it was inevitable,\nafter the argument we had had. It is immaterial to me; she knows now\nthat I am an advocate for Miss Crawford, and she will consequently not\nexpect to see me again.\"\n\n\"In spite of what you say, Darcy, I do think we might do some good,\"\nElizabeth interrupted. \"Let us countermand the carriage. We can easily\ntell the landlord we wish to keep these rooms till Monday.\"\n\nFitzwilliam begged his cousins not to put themselves to such an\ninconvenience on his account; and Darcy being also unwilling to change\nhis plans at the moment when the carriages were driving to the door\nElizabeth was obliged to give up the idea, which she did with greater\nreluctance through feeling that had she not persuaded Miss Crawford to\ngo to Lady Catherine's reception, this disaster would not have occurred.\nRevolving in her mind plans for the future, when all the parties\nconcerned should be removed from the influences at work in Bath, she\ncontinued her preparations for departure; and when all was ready, and\nthe luggage placed on the vehicles, she walked downstairs with Colonel\nFitzwilliam, speaking words of consolation and encouragement to him,\npromising to write to Miss Crawford from their first stopping-place, and\nurging him to wait patiently and not be deterred by Mary's being\nreluctant to see him again for some time after her very painful\nexperience. He promised not to give up hope, but feared that this might\ncause him to lose the ground he had gained.\n\n\"You are very good, Elizabeth,\" he said, as they shook hands. \"Whatever\nhappiness comes out of this I shall owe to you. But it is beyond what I\ncan expect. There never was much reason why she should look at me, and\nnow, if she connects me with this wretched affair, there is less than\never.\"\n\nElizabeth once more earnestly begged him to take a more cheerful view,\nand immediately afterwards she and Darcy started their long journey\nnorthwards; and their cousin, having exchanged a few words with James\nMorland, who had walked round to the hotel a few moments earlier to take\nleave of his friends, returned to his own rooms and to the thought of\nMary Crawford, which, indeed, was never absent from him. His eagerness\nto be with her once more was only exceeded by his desire to protect her\nfair name against the danger which threatened it; and in spite of\nDarcy's advice he came to the conclusion, after long thought, that he\nwas justified in going first to the Ferrars's and then, if necessary, to\nMr. Yates, to demand that whoever was responsible for the calumny should\nretract it. He did not wish to pose as Mary's champion until she had\ngiven him the right to take a warmer interest in her than he might yet\nassert; but as he could not in any case have failed to be aware of the\ninsult last night, and as he was at the same time Miss Crawford's friend\nand Lady Catherine's nephew, he felt that he could do no less than\nendeavour to right the wrong himself, having been unsuccessful in an\nappeal to his aunt, which seemed the most direct.\n\nHe accordingly repaired at once to the Ferrars's lodgings, the address\nof which had been given to him by Anne Steele on one of the many\noccasions on which she had begged him to call there--a request hitherto\nignored; and as soon as he was shown into the room he perceived that his\ntwo errands would be accomplished in one, as Mr. Yates was sitting with\nthe Ferrars and Miss Steele. Fitzwilliam would neither shake hands nor\ntake the offered seat, and addressing himself to Ferrars and Mr. Yates,\nhe requested, in a tone as calm and deliberate as he could make it, that\nthey would immediately and unreservedly withdraw all the accusations\nthey had brought against Miss Crawford, and would furthermore go to Lady\nCatherine and make to her the same complete denial of their previous\nstatements. He was careful to utter Miss Crawford's name as seldom as\npossible, and refrained from demanding an apology to be made to her\npersonally, as he felt the greatest delicacy about appearing to act on\nher behalf, and could judge also that it was not the unkind talk, but\nthe insult from her hostess, that had given her such deep offence. He\nfound his present task an easier one than he had expected; and had his\nheart been lighter, he could have derived amusement from witnessing the\nkind of turmoil which his words immediately created amongst his hearers.\nNeither Robert Ferrars nor Mr. Yates was of a quarrelsome disposition;\nthey were alike in living only for trifles, and in being of an idle,\ncareless, gossiping nature, tolerably good-humoured when it did not\ninterfere with their pleasure or comfort. At that moment the matter of\ngreatest importance to them was to set themselves right with this\nextremely distinguished gentleman, who came to them with an air of such\nauthority; and they hastened with the utmost zeal to assure and protest,\nto deny, regret or explain away whatever might have happened to annoy\nany friend of his.\n\nRobert Ferrars, who, beyond listening eagerly to the story, had had\nnothing to do with the affair, was not long in discovering that his wife\nand her sister were really responsible for the mischief; and both he and\nMr. Yates bitterly reproached the ladies for having broken their promise\nand carried Mr. Yates's information to Lady Catherine. Anne Steele's\ncomposure was not proof against this attack, especially in the presence\nof her admired Colonel Fitzwilliam, and she found a burst of tears the\nmost convenient resource, but Lucy defended herself with spirit, and\ndeclared that she had only told Lady Catherine what it was right for her\nto know, as certainly her ladyship would not wish to receive Miss\nCrawford if half of what Mr. Yates had said was true. This produced a\nrenewed flood of eloquence from Mr. Yates, who denied in the handsomest\nmanner having said anything to Miss Crawford's disadvantage, and wound\nup by boldly asserting that she was a lady for whom he had the greatest\nrespect; that she could not help the faults of her brother, and that as\nfor Edmund Bertram, everyone considered that it was _he_ who had treated\nher badly, \"hanging round her always and never making her an offer--we\nnone of us knew what he could be at.\"\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam intimated that he did not wish to know any of these\nparticulars; that he was come simply because he had learnt that Lady\nCatherine, in consequence of what she had heard, had been led to treat\nher guests with great injustice--injustice was the strongest word he\nwould allow himself to use--and that, for everyone's sake, it was highly\nnecessary for her mind to be disabused of all false impressions. Mr.\nYates, when it was made clear to him, professed himself perfectly ready\nto go to Lady Catherine and give her what he termed the true facts, and\nhe heartily supported Colonel Fitzwilliam in the latter's request that\nMr. Ferrars should accompany him. Mr. Ferrars looked from his friend to\nhis wife, extremely ruffled and uncomfortable; Lucy was reduced to such\na state of anger that she could scarcely speak; but Mr. Yates speedily\nrecovered his usual state of easy _insouciance_ and volubility, and was\nthe only one of the party able to walk with Colonel Fitzwilliam to the\ndoor and usher him out with many bows and smiles and promises to wait on\nhim in the course of a day or two to tell him the result of his\nforthcoming interview. Mr. Yates was not a man who could long be\ndisconcerted by anything; and he probably looked forward to his scene\nwith Lady Catherine as one in which he could play a leading part.\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam walked away, smiling for a moment at the thought of\nthe storm of mutual recrimination that was going on in the room he had\njust left; he feared that what he had achieved would be of little use,\nfor his aunt would be much more desirous of believing the first version\nthan the second. Everything depended now upon the effect of his own\ninfluence upon Mary and her sister--upon whether he could succeed in\natoning to them to any extent for what they had suffered. He greatly\ndistrusted his own powers, and walked to their house in the deepest\ndejection of spirits.\n\nThe servant said the ladies were at home, and he waited for some time in\nthe drawing-room. Mrs. Grant's countenance, when at last she appeared,\nwas not such as to reassure him. She did not ask him to sit down, and\nremained herself standing at a little distance while she explained,\nbriefly and formally, that her sister was not at all well, and was\nunable to receive visitors. Colonel Fitzwilliam's heart sank at this\nconfirmation of his worst fears. He hastened to reply that he knew he\ncould not have expected her to be willing to see any member of his\nfamily after what had happened the night before, but that he brought the\nsincerest, most heartfelt apologies on his own behalf and that of his\ncousins. He was only too sensible that nothing he could say could\nobliterate the memory of the treatment to which Mrs. Grant and her\nsister had been subjected, but he had been endeavouring to right the\nwrong, and hoped that \"when Lady Catherine should be brought to\nacknowledge--\"\n\nMrs. Grant here interrupted him. \"Colonel Fitzwilliam, I must tell you\nplainly that it is not of the slightest use to mention that lady's name\nto my sister or myself. I know you mean very kindly, but the harm is\ndone now, and nothing Lady Catherine can do or say can repair it. I do\nnot wish to go into the whole matter, it is too unspeakably painful; but\nif you had been aware of the language she used towards us, you would see\nthat it is not a thing which can ever be forgotten--I had almost said\nforgiven.\"\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam admitted it fully. He told her who were the real\nauthors of the calumny, as far as regarded Lady Catherine, and he could\nguess how she had been incited to anger, and how she must have spoken,\neven though he had not been present, and he repeated that Lady Catherine\nwould be enlightened, and would regret as much as anyone having spoken\nso hastily; but none of this had any effect on Mrs. Grant. She gradually\nrealized Colonel Fitzwilliam's anxiety to spare her and her sister pain,\nand thanked him for what he had endeavoured to do; but concluded by\nsaying that she sympathized with her sister in feeling that all\nintercourse between the two families had better cease.\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam's dismay was extreme. He felt himself dismissed, but\nrallied his energies enough to ask: \"But you do not identify us, Mrs.\nGrant, my cousins and myself, with everything that my aunt does? Surely\nyou must know Mrs. Darcy, at least, better than to include her in such a\ncondemnation?\"\n\nMrs. Grant appeared confused. \"Mrs. Darcy has been very kind,\" she said\nhesitatingly. \"I have appreciated it.\"\n\nThere seemed a \"but\" behind this, and Colonel Fitzwilliam gently pressed\nfor further reasons, when the lady at last said: \"The truth is, Colonel\nFitzwilliam, if you will have it, my sister feels--and I, though not\ngoing the whole way with her, do understand her point of view--feels at\npresent too bitterly about it to be able to judge impartially. She\nthinks that she should not have allowed Mrs. Darcy to over persuade\nher--that she did wrongly to go to Lady Catherine's on what was\npractically Mrs. Darcy's invitation.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" broke from Fitzwilliam; \"but she does not consider my cousin\nin any way to blame for this behaviour of my aunt's?\"\n\n\"No, certainly not,\" returned Mrs. Grant; \"she blames herself, as I have\nsaid; but she regrets also that Mrs. Darcy took so many pains to induce\nLady Catherine to show us any civility. Lady Catherine disliked us, and\nwhen the opportunity of showing her real feelings arrived, she was glad\nto take full advantage of it.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Grant, believe me, it is not as you think,\" said Fitzwilliam\nearnestly. \"My aunt is just now entirely in the hands of some\nevil-natured and unscrupulous persons, who can make her act in any way\nthey choose.\"\n\n\"It may be so; I try to think so; but it does not excuse her conduct,\"\nreturned Mrs. Grant.\n\nFitzwilliam took two or three turns about the room, wrapped in thought.\nAt length he approached Mrs. Grant, and in tones which scarcely\nconcealed his emotion, said: \"Forgive me, but I cannot take what you\nsay as final. It is, of course, for you and your sister to decide, but I\ncannot think that you mean to cast us off, myself and my cousins, on\naccount of this thing which has happened, a thing which you know we\ndeplore as much as we condemn. May I not hope to be allowed to call upon\nyour sister, if only for a few minutes? not to-day, I know, but\nto-morrow, or the next day? Mrs. Grant, I have no right to say anything;\nbut I think you can guess what it means to me.\"\n\nMrs. Grant's countenance softened, and she spoke more kindly than she\nhad done during the interview. \"I will not pretend to misunderstand you,\nColonel Fitzwilliam; but, frankly, my sister would not see you just now,\nand it would do no good to anyone if you did see her. Her feelings have\nbeen deeply wounded--more deeply, probably, than you have any idea of.\nIt would be far better for you not to think of it any more. You are\nshortly quitting Bath; we, too, shall be leaving for the summer; and at\nsome future time we may, possibly, meet again, and be able then to\ngather up the threads of our friendship.\"\n\nFitzwilliam had turned very pale; for though partly prepared for the\nblow, he had hoped for some mitigating circumstances, and Mrs. Grant's\nwords conveyed to him at that moment nothing but a counsel of despair.\nHe could not immediately reply, but mastering himself with an effort, he\nsaid, steadily: \"I only care for your sister's happiness, and whatever\nshe wishes shall be done\"; then bowed and quickly left the room.\n\nMrs. Grant, left alone, reflected with an aching heart upon the scene\nthat had just closed. Resentful though she felt both on Mary's account\nand her own, yet she had been a very unwilling bearer of the message\nwhich she had delivered to her visitor. She had liked him, she liked\nhim still; she had observed with keen pleasure the growing mutual\nattraction between himself and Mary, for she considered him _almost_\nworthy of that beloved sister. The event of the night before had not\nshaken that belief; whoever was to blame for it, she knew it was not\nLady Catherine's nephew; and when she had partly recovered from her\nagitation she had tried to persuade Mary to do him equal justice,\nknowing well that he would not let the matter rest and that they would\nhear from him again. But Mary had been unpersuadable. The shock had been\nvery great, not only from the incredible insult, but from the sight of\nthe buried past, risen up again to be an undying reproach to her. All\nthat she most bitterly regretted, of her own acts and of other persons',\nall that she most wished to forget, had been revived in her mind,\nexactly at a time when she had allowed herself to think that a new\nprospect of happiness might be opening up before her, in the midst of a\nset of people and circumstances with which the past should be wholly\nunconnected. But now the painful memories had intruded into the present,\nand, thrust upon her in a peculiarly galling manner, threatened to mar\nand taint the new life. Mary's mind was in a state of too great distress\nand tumult for her to see that their power of doing so lay in her own\nhands, that she only could let herself fall back into that wretched,\nlistless, discontented condition from which she had so lately emerged;\nshe only knew that the old influences had returned, and she was bitterly\nangry at the knowledge. In response to her sister's pleading she replied\nthat she was determined not to see any of them again, they were all\nalike, proud and hard-hearted; they patronized her, they made her do\nthings she did not want to do, and she wished she had never met one of\nthem. Mrs. Grant ventured to speak a word on Colonel Fitzwilliam's\nbehalf, but Mary, sore at heart and suffering the more for knowing she\nwas unjust, replied that Colonel Fitzwilliam meant well, but really he\nought to keep his most terrible old aunt in better order. She would not\nconfess even to herself, far less to her sister, how much she had\nlearned to care for the man whom she was now sending away--through\nwounded pride, perversity, anger ... she could hardly have told for what\nreason.\n\nMrs. Grant could only endeavour to soothe and sympathize. She saw it was\nbetter not to continue the discussion of the subject, and looked forward\nto the lapse of time, and a change of scene and companionship, to\nrestore to Mary some measure of comfort and serenity.\n\nOf these blessings Colonel Fitzwilliam was in even greater need. He\nwalked back to the hotel in an agony of mind such as he had never before\nin his life experienced. To the pain of his disappointment was added\nhopelessness, for he felt that the cause of his repulse lay beyond his\npower to remove. She was too deeply offended to see him, or to hear what\nhe had to say, and as she would not do these things he thought she could\nnot possibly care for him. And now, completely cut off from her, he had\nno chance of ever winning his way. His anger against his aunt remained\nunabated; but even were she persuaded to make all the reparation in her\npower, he had been told that it would be unavailing; there was nothing\nmore that anyone could do.\n\nHe called his servant, and gave him directions for leaving Bath early on\nthe following day, then made a pretence of dining, and threw himself\ninto his chair for an evening of sad and solitary reflection. It was\nnearly half-past nine when a card was brought up to him, and it was\nwith a start of surprise that he recollected he had been promised a\nvisit from Mr. Yates.\n\nThat gentleman, well-bred, easy and talkative as usual, was shown into\nhis room a few moments later. Colonel Fitzwilliam had never been more\nill-disposed to receive a guest, but this one must be listened to, and\nit was a relief when he passed from his compliments and observations on\nthe weather to the business at hand, which he introduced with an air of\nnonchalance, as if he had only just remembered what he had come to say.\n\n\"By the way, Colonel,\" he began, \"I was calling on Lady Catherine this\nafternoon, and I took the opportunity of mentioning to her that subject\nwhich we were discussing this morning.\"\n\n\"Did you indeed?\" returned Colonel Fitzwilliam. \"And I hope you were\nable to convince her.\"\n\n\"Why, as to that,\" proceeded Mr. Yates, settling himself more\ncomfortably in his chair, \"I hardly know; I have seldom found a lady so\nhard to convince. But wishing to oblige you, my dear sir, I did my best;\nin all honesty, I did my best. I explained, as I told you I should, that\nshe had been quite misled. Miss Crawford was not at all the sort of\nperson she assumed her to be, and that was very nearly the end of our\nconversation; for I give you my word, Colonel, with all respect to her\nladyship, that she became quite violent; declared that she did not want\nto hear the young lady's name or another word about her, that she was\ntired to death of the whole affair.\"\n\n\"It is probable she would not like to find she had made a mistake,\" said\nFitzwilliam, as Mr. Yates paused, evidently expecting some comment.\n\n\"Well, no; I suppose that was what caused the sting; for it seemed as\nthough she did not want to have to think well of Miss Crawford, which\ncould not be so really, you know. I told her what I had said, I mean,\nwhat I had intended to convey to the Ferrars, that I was surprised no\none knew the story about her brother, and added that I could not imagine\nhow anyone could twist and turn my remarks--merely general ones, made in\nno ill-natured spirit--to Miss Crawford's disadvantage. That set her off\ncross-questioning me, as to what there was at the back of it all, till I\nhardly knew where I was; and I finally had to point out to her that\nowing to my connection with the family I could not enter into the\ndetails of its affairs.\"\n\nHe paused again, and Fitzwilliam forced himself to say: \"I am obliged to\nyou for doing what you could, though I feared it might not be of much\navail.\"\n\n\"True enough, I thought it was not going to be, but just at the end, her\nladyship said, evidently with much resentment: 'There must be something\nin all this, though you deny it. Why should Mrs. Ferrars and Miss Steele\nconcoct a story to tell me? Why should it be in their interest to vilify\nMiss Crawford? There was no reason why they should make the worst of\nwhat they had heard.' So, of course, in reply to that, I simply told her\nthe truth: 'My dear Lady Catherine,' I said, 'you ask why; the reason\nis, as everyone knows, that Mrs. Ferrars was anxious to secure Colonel\nFitzwilliam for her sister, and both the ladies were very much\ndisappointed when he paid attention to Miss Crawford instead.' Why,\nColonel, you are looking quite annoyed; don't trouble to protest, my\ndear sir; between friends, you know, it is not necessary.\"\n\n\"I wish you would confine yourself to talking of things you know\nsomething about, Mr. Yates,\" broke out the Colonel in extreme vexation;\n\"this is not one of them.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, my good sir; not know anything about it! I could not fail to\nsee what was before my very eyes. Before ever we started for your aunt's\nreception last night, Mrs. Ferrars and her sister were talking of you in\na manner as to make me expect that it would be you who would be in\nattendance on Miss Steele all the evening--or at all events, that that\nwas what she hoped for. Of course, I said not a word, but I could see\nthat things turned out very differently. And if that were not enough,\nFerrars himself told me all about it during the evening, of Miss\nSteele's fancy, and what they had planned, and so on. Really, I can\nhardly suppose that being as they are, such friends of Lady Catherine's,\nshe should not have had some idea of it.\"\n\nFitzwilliam had not thought that anything was needed to complete his\ndisgust and annoyance where the whole Ferrars party was concerned; but\nthis tale of gossip and vulgar intrigue had that effect, and he was\nconscious of a strong desire to get rid of his visitor and hear no more\nof the whole nauseous affair. He rose, and again thanked Mr. Yates\ncoldly for the trouble he had taken, and that gentleman, too courteous\nnot to take the hint, rose also, though with evident unwillingness to\nend the conversation, and, drawing near the fire, stretched out a foot\ntowards the blaze, and continued: \"But I must not leave you with the\nimpression that Lady Catherine was _not_ convinced. On the contrary, I\nam inclined to think she eventually was, for her manner quite changed\nafter what I had told her; she seemed first astonished at it, and showed\nconsiderable incredulity and indignation, asking how anyone dared to\nthink or say such a thing, though, as I explained to her, sorry though I\nwas to have given her any unpleasing intelligence, the idea did not\nemanate from me. Upon that, she became calmer and seemed to be\nreflecting, then thanked me and asked to be excused, requesting me, if I\nwas going back to the lodgings, to send Mrs. Ferrars and Miss Steele to\nher at once. I was not particularly anxious to be her messenger, and I\nfancy she saw this, for she called me back and said that it did not\nsignify, she would write to them instead.\"\n\n\"I have gathered,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"that Mr. Ferrars did not accompany\nyou on this occasion.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord, no! I should have mentioned that at first, but it escaped me.\nNo, I could not persuade him to come. I fancy he had private information\nthat his wife did not wish it.\"\n\n\"It was a pity, as he might have confirmed your statements, and afforded\nfurther proof to Lady Catherine,\" observed Colonel Fitzwilliam.\n\n\"He might have said something, no doubt, but I hardly think he would\nhave succeeded if I had failed,\" was Mr. Yates's complacent reply. \"My\ndear sir, I think you may sleep easily. If Lady Catherine is not\npersuaded of her error now, she never will be. At this moment she is\nvery probably explaining to the Ferrars how unfortunately they have\ncaused her to be mistaken.\"\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam felt tolerably certain that his aunt was doing\nnothing of the kind, and that the interview pictured by Mr. Yates was\nturning upon a different subject from Miss Crawford's rehabilitation.\nBut even if Mr. Yates's explanation had caused the Ferrars to fall into\ndisfavour, it would not mean that the harm they had done the day before\nwould be wiped out; Lady Catherine would not be more inclined to forgive\nMiss Crawford because her own friends had made her angry. And angry\nFitzwilliam guessed that she must be at the machinations which Mr.\nYates had casually disclosed. It was always particularly offensive to\nher, and her nephew could conjecture that even the tact and ready wit of\nMrs. Ferrars would not be able to avert the torrent of her displeasure.\nIt was but poor comfort to him to feel assured that she would disapprove\nof Miss Steele as a possible wife for him, quite as much as Miss\nCrawford; and the very idea that such an alternative could have been\nthought of was so repugnant to him that he was glad to dismiss it from\nhis mind. These people had done their worst, and whatever happened now,\nthey could not injure Miss Crawford any more, or blight his own\nprospects more completely.\n\nMr. Yates having, as he considered, disposed of the subject in hand,\nproceeded to others, but Colonel Fitzwilliam contrived to cut him short,\nand to hasten his guest's departure, by indicating his wish to make\npreparations for his early start the following morning. Mr. Yates was\ndesolated to hear that the Colonel would actually have left Bath by\neight o'clock. He himself proposed leaving on the morrow; he had come\nintending to stay with the Ferrars for a week, but really everything was\nso infernally upset, owning to this tiresome affair--he declared Mrs.\nFerrars had as good as called him a liar!--and that he was inclined to\nshorten his visit and go straight to his sister's place in Berkshire. He\nfeared he could not be ready before twelve noon--would not Colonel\nFitzwilliam delay in starting, and accept of a seat in his curricle? The\nColonel regretted it was not in his power, but thought Mr. Yates was\ndoing wisely in going away; and in his own mind added the\nheartily-expressed wish that that well-meaning gentleman had never\ncome.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VII\n\n\nThe Darcys travelled slowly, and they had not been at home for long\nbefore a letter from their cousin, who had gone direct to London from\nBath, was received by Darcy. Colonel Fitzwilliam briefly related what\nhad occurred after their departure, his application to Ferrars and\nYates, with its more or less successful result, and his totally\nunsuccessful visit to Mrs. Grant. He omitted, of course, all reference\nto the second part of Yates's conversation with Lady Catherine, and\nstated his few facts with the smallest amount of comment, adding that he\nwas grateful to his cousins for their kindness in the affair, but in the\ncircumstances he thought it would be better not to return to Pemberley\nfor the present, but to try to occupy his mind with some work. He had\ntherefore accepted an offer made to him by one of his brother officers,\nto collaborate in writing a history of his regiment; and he proposed to\nremain in London, where he would have access to manuscripts and\nauthorities. Darcy need have no fear that he would not correspond as\nregularly as usual, and he would call in at the Hursts' while they\nremained in town, so that he would be in continual touch with, as he\nsaid in conclusion, \"the best friends a man ever had.\" Elizabeth sighed\nover this letter, but consoled herself presently with the thought that\nMrs. Grant and Miss Crawford might possibly be in town during the\nsummer. Darcy, on the other hand, was well satisfied with it, deeming\nthat his cousin had acted with perfect uprightness, and he begged\nElizabeth to give up the idea of trying to bring them all together at\nsome future time. \"Fitzwilliam, my dear, is of an age when he can be\ntrusted to manage his own affairs, as this proves to us,\" he said to\nher.\n\n\"I do not think it proves much, except that Aunt Catherine is the cruel\ndomineering old woman we always knew her to be,\" replied Elizabeth.\n\"Poor Robert! to think of his being so abominably treated! Of course a\ntrue, honest man, as he is, was powerless among these insufferable\npeople, who have not a word of truth amongst them.\"\n\nElizabeth indeed felt acutely disappointed at such a disastrous and\nunforeseen ending to her hopes. She blamed herself bitterly for her\nshare in the disaster, and again regretted having persuaded Miss\nCrawford to come to the reception. She had written to Mary, according to\npromise, at the first opportunity, but not for more than a week after\ntheir return home was an answer received, and then it was a\ndisappointment, like all the rest; merely a note, brief and tremulous,\nacknowledging Mrs. Darcy's kindness and apologies, begging that no more\nmight be said as to the offence, and breaking off with assurance of the\nwriter's good-will, but of her inability to express herself at greater\nlength. The only sign of the real Mary appeared in the postscript, \"I\nwill write again by and by, dear Mrs. Darcy, if you will not mind very\nstupid letters.\" The lines of the note clearly showed the writer's\nshaken health, although her pride forbade her to make it her excuse.\nElizabeth was grieved, and felt herself, for the time being, repulsed;\nshe resolved to send, after a time, a cheerful letter on different\nsubjects which might re-establish their friendship on new ground, so\nthat the painful memories which Miss Crawford at present associated with\nthe Darcy family might by degrees be eradicated.\n\nThese anxieties occupying her thoughts, and her time being taken up with\nher children and with Georgiana, who had returned to Pemberley in\ngreatly improved health and spirits, she still did not fail to remark\nthe absence of any news of Lady Catherine, for she had fully expected a\nspeedy communication announcing the lady's triumph over Miss Crawford\nand ignoring all that had followed it. When her husband, therefore, in\nopening a letter one morning, observed that it was from his aunt, she\nwas prepared for something considerably more disagreeable than its\ncontents proved to be.\n\nThe letter began by announcing Lady Catherine's recent return home with\nher daughter, and the extreme pleasure of Mr. and Mrs. Collins, and of\nall their neighbours, in seeing them again. The worthy Rector and his\nwife had come up to Rosings to pay their respects on the very first\nevening. Mrs. Jenkinson had not yet come back from her vacation; she had\nin fact written to ask leave to stay for another week, which was\nexcessively inconvenient, as dear Anne depended upon her so much. Anne's\nsensibility was indeed very great! She might not have inherited her\nmother's strength of character, but she had such warm affections! They\nsometimes led her to form attachments to people who proved unworthy of\nsuch devotion. There had just been an unfortunate instance of that\nduring their stay at Bath.\n\nDarcy, who had been reading the letter out loud to his wife and sister,\nhesitated at this point, but Elizabeth urged him to go on, saying that\nGeorgiana knew all about the Ferrars, and was as anxious as herself to\nlearn whether their reign was over.\n\n\"You and Elizabeth have probably heard something of the regrettable\ntermination to my reception on your last evening in Bath. The young lady\nwhom Elizabeth was so obstinately anxious for me to patronize must have\nacted at some former time with extreme imprudence, to say the least of\nit, though I really do not feel it to be my duty to investigate the\nrights and wrongs of the matter; still, the information I received was\nso positive, that I was bound to act upon it, and to point out to her\nthat I regretted having brought her into my immediate circle of friends.\nI think I may say that she, or, at any rate, her sister, admitted the\njustice of my remarks. There I hoped the matter would have ended, but\nimmediately afterwards I learned that the very persons from whom I had\nreceived this friendly warning about Miss Crawford had been themselves\nacting towards me in a scandalously hypocritical and underhand manner.\nYou will guess that I refer to the Robert Ferrars and Miss Steele. I\ncannot enter into particulars of their conduct; suffice it to say that\nfor all the latter part of their stay in Bath it has been a continual\ncourse of deception, of nefarious and vulgar schemes for their own\naggrandizement. They have traded upon my kindness, and upon the warm\nregard which my poor innocent-hearted Anne displayed towards Miss\nSteele, to foster the most impudent designs. Never have I been so\nmistaken in people whom I regarded as deserving of my interest, never\nhave I met with such vile ingratitude. You may imagine that I lost no\ntime in sending for the whole family and informing them that our\nacquaintance was at an end, for the reasons I have given, and naturally\nI declined to listen to any defence; Miss Steele was utterly confounded,\nbut Mrs. Ferrars, seeing that her whole plot was exposed, showed herself\nin her true colours; she lost control of herself, and used expressions\nmore insolent than anyone has ever dared to do in my presence. Indeed,\nshe was so determined to be heard, that it was only by leaving the room\nmyself and sending my footman to show them out that I was able to rid\nmyself of their presence. The man is a mere weak fool; I could see that\nby the way he ineffectually tried to control his wife, but even he\nseemed to have no sense of the impropriety of her conduct and her\nsister's.\n\n\"It is easily conjectured that after such a shock as this all enjoyment\nin Bath for me was entirely at an end. We should have left immediately,\nbut that Anne was too unwell, on hearing what had happened, to travel\nfor another week. My indignation at the whole affair is still beyond\nwords.\"\n\nDarcy paused, and Elizabeth asked: \"Is that all the letter,\nFitzwilliam?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied, \"that is, she signs her name there, but there is a\npostscript which is evidently intended for your perusal.\"\n\nElizabeth took the letter which he handed to her, and read: \"Were it not\nthat out of pure perversity Elizabeth always chooses to act exactly the\nopposite to my advice, I should suggest that you proceed very cautiously\nin any further dealings you may have with the young lady I mentioned\nabove.\" Elizabeth flushed deeply and laid down the letter, but\nimmediately took it up again and re-read Lady Catherine's version of the\nFerrars's defeat.\n\nMeanwhile Georgiana was eagerly asking: \"What does Aunt Catherine mean,\nDarcy? She writes strangely, does she not? How can those people have\nnefarious schemes or designs against her? She does not say how she knew\nthey had.\"\n\n\"I hardly understand it all,\" said Darcy, \"but you know your aunt has\noften been disappointed in people before, when they have desired more of\nher favour than she was prepared to give.\"\n\n\"Yes, she takes great fancies, and then forgets about people,\" returned\nGeorgiana, \"but she really seems to be dreadfully angry this time.\nElizabeth says that you and she did not like those people, the Ferrars.\"\n\n\"No, we did not, for we considered them undesirable,\" replied Darcy,\n\"and whatever reason your aunt has for quarreling with them, undoubtedly\nit is well she should have done so.\"\n\nGeorgiana perceived that she was not to hear more about the Ferrars, and\ndropped the subject, which, in fact, was what Darcy wished for. It was a\ndistasteful one to him, for they had aroused his dislike more than most\nof his aunt's prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9s, and he was glad to hear they had fallen from\nfavour, without being interested in the reason for it. Elizabeth was\nquite aware of this, and accordingly refrained from any further\ndiscussion of her aunt's letter with her husband. She could not forbear\na little private smile over the exposure of the \"impudent designs,\" the\nnature of which she had quickly surmised; in the circumstances she\nthought they had hardly merited such severe strictures as those passed\non them by Lady Catherine, and but for Mrs. Ferrars's unpardonable\nconduct towards Miss Crawford, Elizabeth might have spared her some\npity for the manner of her dismissal from Pulteney Street.\n\nGeorgiana took an early opportunity of asking Elizabeth about the\nreferences to Miss Crawford. \"That is your friend of whom you told me,\nis it not, Elizabeth? I wonder what really happened, and why Aunt\nCatherine speaks of her so harshly. It seems very unkind.\"\n\n\"It was very unkind, Georgiana. Of course Aunt Catherine was entirely\nmisinformed; she listened to some malicious gossip, and was terribly\nrude to Miss Crawford at the end of the evening after we left. I heard\nabout it from Robert, who stayed later than we did. And the worst of it\nis, that in consequence Miss Crawford feels deeply wounded, I fear, as\nregards the whole family.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am so sorry. What a pity it is. Cannot anything be done? Surely\nyou will be able to put it all right again some time, will you not?\"\n\n\"I hope so; yes, of course, I shall do whatever is possible: I should be\nso extremely sorry to lose sight of her now.\"\n\n\"She must be charming, from all you say,\" commented Georgiana, and then\nasked rather shyly and with a deep blush: \"Did Cousin Robert like her\ntoo?\"\n\n\"Yes, he liked her very much, I think. You know, she played the harp,\nand he is so fond of anything to do with music.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Georgiana; and added, in a low voice: \"I remember he\nwould always much rather have listened to my playing than have talked to\nme.\"\n\n\"Do not let yourself grieve, Georgiana,\" said Elizabeth, kissing the\nyoung girl's fair brow; \"you know that Robert has the greatest possible\nregard for you, and you will find, next time you meet, that you are the\nbest of friends.\"\n\nGeorgiana smiled rather sadly; she often felt that she must have not\nonly fallen in the estimation of a cousin she revered, but that she must\nalso be possessed of no qualities capable of inspiring affection, and\nwhat was even worse, of no heart of her own to give. Elizabeth\nunderstood her well, and tried often to give her more self-confidence\nand to raise her lowly opinion of herself; but though she was growing\nless reserved, and more disposed little by little to trust her own\njudgments, the old habits of timidity, of reliance on the guidance of\nthose whom she loved, were still strong in her. Elizabeth would often\nrefuse to decide a thing for her, but when she was helped to weigh it in\nthe balance, to judge it by all the standards available, her choice\ncould always be recommended for discretion and clear-sightedness.\n\nThe month of May was now nearly half-way through, and the time was\napproaching when James Morland was expected to pay a visit to his\nfriends at Pemberley. So much of their stay at Bath had been productive\nof disappointment, that they looked back upon their acquaintance with\nthis young man as its one circumstance of unalloyed pleasure. Darcy,\nwhose regard for him had grown very warm, had received letters from home\nwhich enabled him, prior to leaving Bath, to inform Morland that a\nliving in his gift would shortly be vacant, and that he would have the\npleasure in offering it to Morland when the time came. This important\ncommunication had been received by the young clergyman with a depth of\njoy and gratitude which had increased the Darcys' satisfaction in being\nable to assist him. The living, though not a rich one, would suffice for\nhis needs, as he possessed some capital advanced by his father: and its\nsituation, in a hilly and bracing country district, made it most\ndesirable for a person whose health, like his own, had to be\nconsidered. The conversation between himself and Darcy, which had been\nvery short, had taken place only the day before the latter's departure,\nand Morland, still scarcely realizing his good fortune, had hurried\nround to the hotel the following morning to repeat his acknowledgments\nto both his friends and to make his adieux. There was time only for a\nvery few words to be exchanged at the house door, and Morland found it\ndifficult to express himself fluently on a subject which lay so near his\nheart, but Elizabeth and her husband set him at his ease with a few kind\nremarks, repeating cordially an invitation already given, that he come\nand stay with them on the conclusion of his visit to the Portinscales.\nSince their return home the resignation of the old Rector at Kympton,\nthe living in question, had been made public. He was to leave within a\nfew weeks; so that Morland's visit would afford him, as the\nrector-designate, an opportunity of getting to know the place and of\nmeeting some of his future parishioners. Pemberley was not in the\nparish, for Kympton was eighteen miles away, but the link between the\ntwo places had always been strong, and the distance was frequently\nbridged, for Desborough Park, the home of the Bingleys, was the\nprincipal house in Kympton Parish, and only a mile and a half from the\nparsonage house. Morland's pleasure was extreme on hearing that his\nnearest neighbours would be the brother-in-law and favourite sister of\nMrs. Darcy. Next to being within a stone's throw of the Darcys\nthemselves, it was the best thing imaginable.\n\nMorland arrived at Pemberley late one afternoon, just in time to prepare\nfor dinner, and was introduced to Miss Darcy when they all assembled in\nthe drawing-room before the meal. Georgiana's intense shyness generally\ncaused her to appear at a disadvantage with strangers, but there was\nsomething in the young man's open countenance and pleasing, unaffected\nmanners that attracted everyone to him at first sight, and they were\nsoon chatting together completely at their ease. Morland was deeply\ninterested in everything that he could learn of his future home, and\nasked eager questions of his hosts. Georgiana had been so lately staying\nat Desborough, and had, while there, so frequently called on old Dr. and\nMrs. Taylor, that she was able to give more particulars of the house and\ngarden than her brother and sister were able to recollect. The evening\npassed quickly away with conversation and music, and Morland learned\nthat on the following morning the whole party were to drive over to\nDesborough Park to dinner, starting early that they might have time to\nwalk through the village and inspect the church and parsonage as well.\n\nThe weather proved propitious, and the drive, through some of the most\nbeautiful vales of Derbyshire, was agreeable to all, but especially\ndelightful to Morland, feeling as he did that he was within reach of the\ngoal he had so long desired--restored health and the power to do the\nwork he loved amid congenial surroundings. It was in vain that Darcy,\nnot wishing to raise his hopes too high, told him that the parish was\nvery scattered and the roads bad, that the climate was exceedingly cold\nand the distant cottages were almost inaccessible in stormy weather,\nthat some of the farmers were people of a very independent way of\nthinking, difficult to get on with--he could discover no drawback, only\nfresh incentives to throw himself into his task. Elizabeth commended him\nfor his enthusiasm, but added a sly reminder that he might be\ndisappointed in the house; large, rambling and picturesque though it may\nseem when tenanted by the Taylors and their seven children, it would,\nshe feared, be an inconvenient residence to a bachelor.\n\n\"It will be too big, I have no doubt,\" responded Morland, \"but, you\nknow, I need not furnish more than a part of it. Besides, I intend, as\nsoon as I am thoroughly settled to have my sister Sarah to stay with me\nif she can be spared from home.\"\n\nGeorgiana was interested in hearing of the sister, and James Morland at\nher request gave an account of his home at Fullerton, and of his brother\nand sisters, eight besides himself and Catherine, who was now Mrs. Henry\nTilney. Catherine was evidently the favourite--there was a smile and a\nlightening of the eye when he spoke of her--he wished it had been\npossible for her to come and help him with his settling-in, but they\nlived such a great distance away--Woodston was forty miles away from\nBath, quite at the other end of Somerset.\n\nMr. Darcy's chaise and four rolled through the village of Kympton not\nlong after twelve o'clock, and paused to put down its owner, his sister\nand his young guest. There was so much to see, but Georgiana was an\nuntiring walker, and intended staying with the gentlemen until the\ncarriage should be sent back to bring them to Desborough in time for an\nearly dinner. Elizabeth drove on for another two miles, and was\npresently alighting at the door of a handsome modern house built in the\nItalian style, and being warmly welcomed by Bingley and Jane, whom she\nhad not seen for some weeks.\n\nBingley, on hearing what had become of the rest of the party,\nimmediately decided to walk down to meet them; and the sisters strolled\ninto the garden, for the weather was remarkably warm and sunny for that\ntime of year, and they could venture to seat themselves upon a bench\nthat was sheltered by an angle of the house, whence a beautiful view was\nobtained of the wide-spreading park, with its chestnut trees in full\nbloom and clumps of pink and white hawthorns. Desborough was not so\nimposing and extensive a place as Pemberley, but it was pleasant and\nhome-like, and the grounds were particularly delightful, including as\nthey did an orchard, a shrubbery, and lawns and flower-borders laid out\nin a series of terraces which sloped towards the park. The Bingleys took\ngreat pleasure in their garden, and had made many additions and\nimprovements during the two years of their occupancy.\n\n\"I am overjoyed that you are come, Lizzie,\" began Jane, \"for I have so\nmuch to tell and ask. I have not seen you since we brought Georgiana\nhome, nearly a month ago. You really think she is better?\"\n\nElizabeth warmly assented, and declared that Georgiana seemed in greater\nspirits than she had been for many months. Jane anxiously inquired after\nFitzwilliam, and Elizabeth made out as good an account of him as she\ncould, but as she was naturally not at liberty to mention what had\npassed at Bath, she could not perfectly satisfy Jane as to his\nwell-being. Choosing a safer subject, she talked of Mr. Morland, praised\nhis modesty, ability and good sense, and repeated her conviction that\nthe Bingleys would find him a thoroughly agreeable neighbour. Jane\nlistened with interest and promised every kind of help and support to\nthe new Rector, who was to come with such strong recommendations; but\nshe was clearly a little preoccupied, and Elizabeth, seeing this, asked\nwhat news she had to communicate.\n\n\"I am afraid it is not very good news,\" began Jane hesitatingly;\n\"but--you will have guessed it, I expect--I have had a letter from\nLydia. She is going abroad, Elizabeth, fancy, almost immediately! Poor\nLydia! Wickham's regiment is ordered to the West Indies, and he insists\non her going with him.\"\n\n\"I am not sure why it should be 'poor Lydia,'\" returned Elizabeth,\nsmiling; \"you have such a terribly compassionate heart, Jane! I should\nthink Lydia would like the West Indies very much, though she probably\ndreads the voyage.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, she does not think she will like them at all; it is so hot\nthere, and she cannot bear the idea of being waited on by negro\nservants. She says there is only one consolation, very few of the ladies\nof the regiment are going; there will not be more than six of them, and\nno one as young as herself.\"\n\n\"Since so many are staying behind, I should have thought she could have\narranged to do the same; though I confess I think it is much better she\nshould be with Wickham.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are right, I believe, Elizabeth; she says she would rather\nhave stayed in England, and that Wickham declares he does not\nparticularly want her, only he cannot afford to keep up an establishment\nfor her at home while he is abroad.\" Jane sighed. \"It is very sad that\nthey talk like that to one another; I only hope they do not mean it.\"\n\nElizabeth preferred to waive this question, and continued: \"I suppose\nshe goes on to ask you for money?\"\n\nJane admitted that this was so, but said that Lydia would need a\nsuitable outfit for the West Indies, and everything of that kind was\nvery expensive, it appeared. She added that Lydia was anxious to come to\nDerbyshire before she went away, if a remittance for the journey could\nbe sent, but Jane had not made any response to the suggestion.\n\n\"No, I do not think that that is at all necessary,\" Elizabeth remarked.\n\"Well, Jane, of course I will give you some bank-notes to send with your\nown, on the usual condition that Lydia does not know from whom they\ncome; but I only wish one could believe that they will be used for\npaying debts to the Newcastle tradespeople--of which there are sure to\nbe plenty. Could you not persuade her to give you a statement of what\nshe owes? You could then perhaps arrange for some of them to be paid off\nfirst.\"\n\n\"I will try; I will ask Bingley about it; but it is very difficult to\nhelp Lydia the way one would like. She does expect the most\nextraordinary things! What do you think of her inviting Kitty to go to\nthe West Indies with her, my father, of course, paying all expenses?\"\n\n\"I am past feeling any astonishment at Lydia's demands,\" Elizabeth said;\n\"but I hope Kitty had too much good sense even to think such a thing\npossible.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, I think she knew it would not be allowed, though perhaps the\nidea was tempting to her, poor Kitty! But she had her promised visit\nhere to plead as an excuse; she is coming, you know, towards the end of\nnext month.\"\n\n\"It has been arranged, then? I am so glad to hear it; she must come on\nto Pemberley, and she and Georgiana will enjoy being together again.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed; but I hope she will stay with me until the autumn. I\nwanted her to have come a little earlier; but she has received an\ninvitation from some people called Knightley, in London, which she is\nvery desirous of accepting, and my father sees no objection.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know of whom you mean, I think; they are friend of my Uncle and\nAunt Gardiner's, and live in Brunswick Square.\"\n\n\"I fancy it is not those Knightleys, but relations of theirs; still, we\nshall hear all about it very soon, for I am expecting a letter from\nKitty at any moment, to give me her direction in London and to tell me\nwhen she will be ready to leave, for Bingley is to go to fetch her.\"\n\n\"Is Bingley going to town? Then I wonder if it could possibly be\narranged for him to escort Georgiana? Darcy had thought of going, but he\nwould be very glad not to, if Bingley would not find it any\ninconvenience.\"\n\n\"I am sure Bingley would be delighted. She is going to the Hursts', is\nshe not? I have heard mention of it.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mrs. Hurst and Caroline have both written, begging for a long\nvisit from her. I do not think it can be for more than a month, as Aunt\nCatherine is sure to want her to go on to Rosings when she hears she is\nso near. Georgiana does not like being away from home for long, nor do\nwe like to spare her.\"\n\n\"I can quite understand that. She has such a sweet disposition, such\nsympathy, and brightness and intelligence, that it is a joy to have her\ncompanionship. And you have improved her so much, Elizabeth. At one time\nI thought her very difficult to approach; but her manners have gained so\nmuch ease and elegance that everyone must be charmed with her from the\nfirst meeting. I often think Fitzwilliam must regret what he has lost.\"\n\n\"My dear Jane, let me assure you for the twentieth time that he does not\nregret it, nor can he be said to have lost what he never possessed.\nTheir hearts were never united; but now you will see that each will\nmarry happily, and their old friendship will survive unimpaired. If you\nhad seen Fitzwilliam at Bath, you would have wasted no regrets on him.\nNow, shall we walk about a little? I want to discover if your lilacs are\nfurther advanced than ours.\"\n\nThree o'clock brought back the remainder of the party, and Mr. Morland\nwas introduced to Mrs. Bingley, and found her a most sympathizing\nlistener to his enthusiasm over his new home. He was full of plans, and\nwas interested in everything, from the beautiful little church down to\nthe honeysuckle growing over the Rectory porch. Darcy had promised him\nto have certain repairs and renovations made as soon as the Taylor\nfamily should have quitted the house; and faulty chimneys and new\nwallpapers formed topics for a kind of discussion which Bingley\nthoroughly enjoyed, and he would have presented his young guest with the\ncontents of several rooms at Desborough, and the greater part of the\nstables, if there had been the slightest chance of his accepting them.\n\nThere was not time to do more than begin on these important subjects\nto-day, for by half-past four the visitors had to be in the carriage\nagain; but the proposal that Bingley should take Georgiana on her\njourney to London was brought forward and approved of by all concerned.\nBingley was also going to his sister's house, and it was immaterial to\nhim what day he arrived there, or how long he had to wait in London for\nKitty Bennet. He thought he had heard something about a ball for which\nKitty wished to stay, but was uncertain about the date.\n\nIt was decided that their next letters from their relations in town\nshould determine the time of their departure.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VIII\n\n\nMorland was easily persuaded to prolong his stay at Pemberley until his\ninduction to his new living should take place. This was expected to be\nnot later than the end of June, for Dr. Taylor was anxious to hand over\nhis duties to his successor as soon as possible. Morland was by no means\nan idler; he spent a considerable part of his time in study, and read\nand worked with Mr. Ferrars, helping him occasionally in parish duties.\nThe acquaintance of these two men, formed directly after Morland's\narrival, promised to ripen into a friendship; there were similarities in\ntheir characters that mutually attracted them, and on the tranquil\nsimplicity of the life at the Parsonage Morland hoped to model his own.\nThe Ferrars had so recently arrived at Pemberley, having, as has been\nsaid, exchanged livings with the former incumbent, and left Delaford\nshortly after Colonel Brandon's death, that there had not been time for\nmuch intercourse between them and the Darcys, though Elizabeth had been\ngreatly pleased with what she had seen of Mrs. Ferrars. Since the\nformer's return from Bath, and after her experiences there of the other\nbranch of the family, she could appreciate fully the immense superiority\nof the Edward Ferrars over their relations. Ferrars himself was too\nquiet, diffident, and reserved a man to recommend himself easily, but in\nhis wife all recognized a woman of a rare and noble nature,\ndistinguished alike by the sweetness of her character and by its\nstrength. The Darcys rejoiced in the increased opportunities of meeting\nafforded by the presence of their guest, and various walks, drives and\nout-of-doors excursions were organized, for which the glorious weather\nof early June afforded every opportunity.\n\nThe first diminution their party suffered was in the departure of\nGeorgiana for London, which occurred on the seventeenth of the month.\nThe visit had long been talked of, and Georgiana really looked forward\nwith no little pleasure to seeing her old friends, for Caroline Bingley\nand Louisa took pains not to show to her, of whom they were exceedingly\nfond, the cold-hearted and worldly aspect of their dispositions; but\nwhen she found herself actually in the travelling carriage with Bingley,\nwith her maid seated opposite, she felt, as she did every year, the\nsensation of leaving all that she cared for behind her, and of entering\nscenes alarming because unfamiliar. Bingley good-naturedly endeavoured\nto divert her in every way, talked of the pleasures awaiting her, and of\nthe friends she would see in London, Kitty Bennet and Mrs. Annesley,\nbesides her hostesses, and casually mentioned the possibility of her\ncoming across Colonel Fitzwilliam. Georgiana had been prepared for this\nby Elizabeth, and had first shrunk from the idea; but afterwards became\nreconciled to the view put before her, that the first meeting, which\nmust necessarily be painful, must come some time, and it would be best\nto get it over in a crowd, with a few ordinary words of greeting, which\nwould put them on a comfortable footing for the future. She, therefore,\nmade an effort to reply cheerfully to all Bingley's suggestions, and had\nnot found the journey tedious when they drew up in Grosvenor Street in\ntime for dinner on the third day.\n\nCaroline and Louisa could not make enough of her, and the evening was\nspent in talking over the plans they had formed for her amusement, and\nin detailing the engagements they had entered into. It soon appeared\nthat the ball which Bingley had mentioned was on their list; for they\nwere also acquainted with Mrs. George Knightley, whose entertainment it\nwas, and had secured invitations from her for their brother and their\nyoung friend. Bingley inquired of the date of the ball, explaining how\nit affected his movements; and his sisters endeavoured to conceal their\nsurprise on hearing that Miss Kitty Bennet was staying with the\nKnightleys.\n\n\"I thought, when you spoke of coming to fetch her, Charles, that she was\nwith her uncle and aunt in Gracechurch Street,\" said Miss Bingley.\n\n\"To tell the truth, I was not very clear about it myself,\" returned\nBingley. \"Jane told me that she was going to stay over this ball, but\nwhether she was with the Gardiners or the Knightleys I did not make out\nuntil just before we came away. It does not make a vast deal of\ndifference, to my thinking.\"\n\n\"There is certainly some difference; the Knightleys live in Portland\nSquare, for one thing,\" replied Miss Bingley.\n\n\"Do they? I am glad of that, for it means I shall not have to drive so\nfar round to pick Kitty up,\" was Bingley's cheerful answer, and he moved\naway to speak to Mr. Hurst, leaving his sisters to their speculations\nas to how Miss Bennet could have come to know the George Knightleys.\nGeorgiana did not know, but conjectured it was through Mr. and Mrs.\nGardiner; and the ladies, though they refrained from showing their\nperplexity, were even more puzzled to account for the uncle who lived in\nCheapside being acquainted with such people of fashion.\n\n\"Have you seen anything of Fitzwilliam, Louisa?\" inquired Bingley of his\neldest sister, when he came to have his coffee-cup refilled.\n\n\"Really, Charles, what a foolish question to ask,\" replied Mrs. Hurst,\nwith affected carelessness. \"Of course we see him frequently when he is\nin town.\"\n\n\"Very good; I hope he will come round while I am here, and, if not, I\nshall get you to give me his direction, for I must certainly look him up\nbefore I go back.\"\n\nMrs. Hurst made a vague answer, for both she and her sister were\nsincerely anxious to spare Georgiana any embarrassment, and they would\nnot of their own accord have referred to Fitzwilliam until they knew how\nshe was able to bear the mention of his name in public. Caroline\nimmediately began speaking of another subject, but Georgiana, divining\ntheir intentions, felt that she must not indulge in a foolish\nsensibility which might give her friends a false impression of the state\nof things; so, summoning all her courage, she said, with a deep blush\nbut a tolerably firm voice: \"Yes, I hope my cousin may be in town this\nmonth. Elizabeth and my brother gave me many messages for him, if I\nshould see him.\"\n\nShe was conscious that the ladies were looking at her in surprise, but\nthat Bingley noticed nothing but the amount of milk Louisa was putting\nin his coffee was a great help, and Caroline, the next moment, said\nquietly: \"Oh, yes, no doubt he will call,\" which made it unnecessary for\nGeorgiana to say any more. Bingley, having secured his cup, next\nproduced a notebook and proceeded to write down the address of\nFitzwilliam's lodgings and the name of his club, and, as an\nafterthought, the various engagements to which he had been pledged by\nhis sisters. Georgiana found that Mrs. Hurst and Caroline were anxious\nshe should go with them on the following day to call in Portman Square\nand meet Mrs. George Knightley.\n\nMrs. Knightley, formerly Emma Woodhouse, had, since her marriage, been\nable to enjoy a larger measure of the social power and influence in the\nuse of which she had always delighted. Since Mr. Woodhouse's death she\nhad persuaded her husband to go into Parliament, and except for short\nvisits to Donwell, they now lived entirely in London--an arrangement\nwhich just suited Emma, who had long desired some stir and variety in\nher life, after having spent so many unbroken years in a country\nvillage. Mr. Knightley still took the greatest interest in the farming\nof his property, and as soon as he was trustee to his sister-in-law,\nMrs. John Knightley, for the estate of Hartfield, which had passed to\nher on her father's death, he found as much to do out of London as in\nit; while Emma, though fond of Donwell, had grown weary of the\nneighbourhood, and took a keen pleasure in forming round her in London a\nlarge circle of acquaintances, whom she loved to entertain, and in whose\ncharacters and careers she took the deepest interest.\n\nMrs. Knightley's ball had become an annual fixture in the month of June,\nand this year she had a special incentive for giving it and for making\nit as gay as possible. At her sister's house she had met Mrs. Gardiner,\nwhose husband had long been a close friend in business of Mr. John\nKnightley. Mrs. Gardiner was chaperoning a niece, Miss Catherine Bennet,\na slender, blooming young girl, and pretty without being very striking;\nbut Mrs. Knightley was impressed with her pleasing manners, and the\nenthusiasm with which she received the prospect of a theatre party which\nwas being discussed on that occasion. It was the work of a moment for\nEmma to decide that she must ask her sister to bring Miss Bennet to the\nball; but during the remainder of the evening, while she considered and\nobserved, an improvement on the first idea suggested itself; Miss Bennet\nmust be invited to stay in Portman Square for the great occasion. What\nbetter arrangement could there be? Isabella would not want to stay late,\nbut young girls liked to dance till the last moment, and she, Emma,\nwould have the benefit of Miss Bennet's help in the preparations, and\nwould be able to introduce her to her partners beforehand. Yes, Miss\nBennet was certainly very pretty, prettier than she had appeared at\nfirst--such a slim, upright figure, such a profusion of hair, such a\ndelicate fairness of complexion; she would be a great success! It would\nbe as delightful as when last year, the girl who was at the ball as Mrs.\nKnightley's special friend and prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9e had finished the evening\ntriumphantly becoming engaged to the most eligible man present, Sir\nWilliam Manvers. Emma felt a thrill at the recollection. The event had\njustified all her admiration for Sophia Lennox, and Mr. Knightley, who\nhad been so sceptical, had been obliged to admit that sometimes people\ndid marry those whom one had destined for them. There was no Sir William\nManvers this year, it was true; but Miss Bennet was still young, and\nthere was plenty of time for the right man to appear. In fact, it was\nreally only her due that she should be properly taken out in London, in\norder that she might have every chance, and this her aunt, Mrs.\nGardiner, was quite evidently not able to give her.\n\nWhat wonder that the upshot of these reflections was a courteous note to\nMrs. Gardiner, begging for the pleasure of a visit from Miss Bennet as\nsoon as her stay in Gracechurch Street should be concluded. Kitty was in\ntransports of happiness when all was arranged and she found herself\nactually Mrs. George Knightley's guest, with a ball in prospect, and\neach day one round of visits and shopping and other delights, with\nintervals only long enough to admit of changing one elegant gown for\nanother, for her mother and sisters had taken care she should be\nprovided with an ample wardrobe. She soon ceased to regret not having\nbeen allowed to accompany Lydia to the West Indies, and before many days\nwere over had discovered a reason to rejoice that she had not gone.\n\nAmong Mrs. Knightley's frequent visitors at this time was a young naval\nlieutenant named William Price, whom she had met a short time previously\nat the house of the same Mr. Yates who had paid a visit to Bath in the\npreceding spring. Mr. Yates lived in Cavendish Square, and as his wife\nwas a first cousin of William Price's, they had begged the young man to\nmake their house his home whenever he happened to be in London. Young\nPrice had lately been attached to a ship of the line, the _Andromeda_,\nwhich he had been obliged to put into Portsmouth for repairs, and he had\nbeen employing some of the period of his enforced leisure in taking up a\ncourse of signalling and gunnery, as he was extremely anxious to gain\npromotion as speedily as possible; but he had found that it was\nnecessary to use other means than those of mere hard work, and at the\npresent time he was living in London, keeping in touch with the\nAdmiralty and endeavouring to recommend himself to every high official\nand person of influence with whom he could contrive to become\nacquainted. In the intervals he paid hasty visits to his sisters, who\nwere settled in Northamptonshire, and to his mother at Portsmouth; and\nbeing a young man of excellent address, great charm of manner and marked\nabilities, he had gained a deserved popularity, and could not help\nenjoying the gaiety of London life, available to him through the\nhospitality of numerous friends. Mrs. Knightley was extremely pleased\nwith him, and with his next brother, David, who was a clerk in the India\nOffice, and both young men found it a very agreeable house to come to,\nespecially when to the welcome of their hostess was added that of a\npretty girl who, warm-hearted and impulsive, did not attempt to conceal\nher pleasure in their company.\n\nDavid Price was two or three years her junior, and in him Kitty Bennet\nfound only a merry and boyish companion; but the manliness of the young\nsailor aroused different feelings, and it was not long before she\nrealized that the visits of William Price were becoming the most\nimportant thing in her life. She dreamt of him before he came, she had\nno eyes for anyone else when he was present, and she treasured his words\nwhen he had gone; and although she could not honestly read into those\nwords more than a passing friendliness, yet she allowed herself to\ncherish hopes that each _next_ time there might be something warmer.\nPoor Kitty had secretly longed to be married ever since she was\nsixteen; and now at last it seemed as if Destiny itself was working for\nher, in placing her with so kind a hostess, who was always giving\ninvitations and affording opportunities, and in sending her such a\nsplendid hero of romance to fall in love with, for a hero he was, of a\ncampaign at sea, when he had distinguished himself as much by bravery as\nhe had on shore by industry; a hero with good looks, an assured\nposition, and prize-money saved, and at the present moment with nothing\nparticular to do but fall in love with Miss Kitty Bennet! It was\nimpossible not to feel, under the circumstances, that the course of\nevents was plainly marked out. Mrs. Knightley certainly thought so too,\nand although she refrained from definite statements, her sympathetic\nattitude encouraged Kitty to talk herself into hope and self-confidence.\n\nThe importance of the ball itself in the great scheme of things was not\noverlooked, and Emma even dreamt now of a brilliant d\u00c3\u00a9nouement like last\nyear's. She had invited a large number of people, and was anxious to\nhave as many dancing couples as possible, so Mrs. Hurst's request for\npermission to bring her brother and Miss Darcy was warmly acceded to,\nand it was only a matter of regret that their friend Colonel Fitzwilliam\ncould not be induced to go to any balls this season. Kitty was delighted\nat the prospect of meeting Georgiana again, and when the call spoken of\nby Mrs. Hurst was being paid, on the day following Georgiana's arrival,\nshe availed herself of a pause in the conversation, and a nod and a\nsmile from Mrs. Knightley, to ask her friend to come to another room for\na few moments, on the plea of showing her some new possessions.\n\nGeorgiana duly admired the bonnets and pelisses, and the gold chain\nwhich was Mrs. Knightley's present, and the rose-coloured ball dress\nwhich was to make its first appearance on the much-talked-of occasion.\nKitty's head was evidently full of this event; she dwelt on it\nconstantly, and from her quick nervous manner Georgiana guessed at some\nkind of special preoccupation with the subject.\n\n\"And so you are very happy here, Kitty? Perhaps I need not ask that,\"\nshe said, as Kitty turned to unfold another new muslin gown.\n\n\"Oh, very, very happy, perfectly happy,\" exclaimed Kitty with eagerness.\n\"Mrs. Knightley is so kind, and such nice people come here, you have no\nidea, Georgiana. Now, do look; is not that beautiful? A real India\nmuslin, and the colour just suits me. You ought to like it, for I bought\nit with some money Elizabeth gave me.\"\n\n\"Yes, dear, I do like it, of course,\" returned Georgiana; \"but tell me\nsome more about yourself. How long were you with the Gardiners?\"\n\n\"I forget just how long, but I came here on the first of June. Oh, I do\nnot know how ever I shall be able to leave! Georgiana, I must tell you!\nI have been longing to do so, and yet I do not know how I can, after\nall, for it has not really happened yet.\n\n\"Of course you have guessed,\" she went on, in answer to Georgiana's\naffectionately inquiring glance; \"it can only be one thing: but pray do\nnot mention it to anyone, for no one has any idea of it except Mrs.\nKnightley. It is so wonderful! Georgiana, do you believe in love at\nfirst sight?\"\n\n\"I have never thought about it,\" answered Georgiana honestly, \"but I\nshould think it might be possible.\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed, it is possible! It does happen. When you see him, you\nwill know how easily. You will see him on Tuesday night; I do wonder\nwhat you will think of him. You must be sure to tell me quite\ntruthfully.\"\n\n\"Dear Kitty, you cannot think how glad I am. You mean you are engaged,\nor just about to be?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no, no!\" exclaimed Kitty, \"you do not understand. I think--I\nhope--but I do not even know if he cares. Sometimes I feel sure he does,\nand then, again, he seems to be perfectly indifferent, and it is so\nterrible then, more terrible than you can imagine. But you will see--you\nwill judge for yourself; I shall depend so much upon you for comfort and\ncounsel, especially if Bingley asks him to come down and stay at\nDesborough, as I mean to persuade him to do.\"\n\nGeorgiana was not much enlightened, and her shyness and natural reserve\nmade her hesitate to ask questions on such a subject, which, had she\nbeen Kitty, she could not have mentioned to any living creature. But\nKitty was evidently longing for sympathy, and poured out her hopes and\nfears and her reasons for both, mingling with them a description of\nWilliam Price, painted in the most vivid colours and emphasizing his\ncourage and distinction as an officer, his amiability as a man, his\nperfection as a ball-room partner, and the high opinion Mr. Knightley\nand all sensible men had formed of him. Georgiana listened, and was\ninterested almost against her will; she had known Kitty to take fancies\nseveral times before for persons who had not returned her regard or\nthought of doing so; but in this case, from what she could gather, the\nyoung man seemed really to deserve Kitty's enthusiasm; they had met\nunder Mrs. Knightley's auspices, he had been very often at the house,\nand certainly, everything considered, it was much more likely that he\nshould fall in love with Kitty than not. Nevertheless, she hardly knew\nhow to answer her; to encourage her in hopes which might prove false\nwould be the cruellest kindness, so, while, murmuring her wishes for her\nfriend's happiness, she agreed that she must wait for the evening of the\nball before she could really tell how far Kitty's dreams were likely to\nbe realized.\n\nThey talked so long that eventually she had to propose a return to the\ndrawing-room, fearing to be guilty of discourtesy towards Mrs.\nKnightley; but she was glad that only a moment was left for Kitty's\nhurried inquiry about her own affairs, as they hastened down the\nstaircase, and that she could therefore dismiss the subject with a light\nword. Kitty was scarcely satisfied, but finding that Georgiana could not\nbe induced to speak of Colonel Fitzwilliam, returned to her own\nall-absorbing topic with the remark, \"I do wish you could meet someone\njust like my dear Mr. Price!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter IX\n\n\nThe next few days passed rapidly for both girls, and were so full of\nengagements that they were not able to arrange another meeting, and\nGeorgiana deeply regretted the fact that, except for a glimpse of her at\nthe ball, she should not see Kitty again before Bingley's departure from\ntown. She could only hope that all would go well, and looked forward to\na fuller intercourse in Derbyshire in a few weeks' time. Meanwhile,\nthere were many friends to see, and Georgiana would have enjoyed herself\nthoroughly had she not dreaded the first meeting with Colonel\nFitzwilliam, which she felt hanging over her, since Bingley had called\non the Colonel and reported him to be in town, but which she did not\nknow when to expect. A slight change in her plans, necessitating a short\nabsence from Mr. Hurst's house, led her to imagine that it would be\ntemporarily averted; but on the very day of the ball, when she and her\nhostesses had remained at home, and a larger number of visitors than\nusual happened to be in the room, she experienced a painful shock on\nhearing his name announced and on seeing him walk into the room. Next\nmoment she was angry with herself for losing her composure, even\nmomentarily, and bracing herself for a possible encounter, she\nendeavoured to continue to bear her part in a conversation with two or\nthree of Mrs. Hurst's friends, who, she realized gratefully, were\nstrangers to her until that day. It was some minutes afterwards that she\nwas aware of Colonel Fitzwilliam approaching her, guided by Miss\nBingley, whose kindly intentions of making the occasion as ordinary as\npossible only served to intensify its discomfort. Georgiana, however,\nthought the fault all hers, as, not reassured at all by Caroline's\ncheerful \"Colonel Fitzwilliam was so glad to hear you were staying with\nus, Georgiana,\" she found herself only just able to give him her hand\nwith an almost inaudible greeting, while her face, suffused with deepest\nblushes, must, she felt, have made her noticeable to all around. It was\nColonel Fitzwilliam's part to set her at her ease, which he did, to some\nextent with a few kindly and naturally-expressed sentences, inquiring\nabout her journey, and the health of those she had left behind.\n\nGeorgiana presently ventured to let her eyes rest on him, and was\nstartled to see how much older he looked even in the short time since\nshe'd seen him, and how ill and worn. A terror seized her heart that she\nmight be guilty of these altered looks, but it passed in an instant;\nthere was not any doubt that their parting had been for the good of\nboth; but poor Cousin Robert, it was plain to see that he had been\nsuffering, from whatever cause, and her sympathy went out to him\nunconsciously, even while she could hardly talk to him from\nembarrassment of knowing that Caroline Bingley was standing by,\napparently occupied with other people, but drawing conclusions from\nevery word she could hear.\n\n\"I had intended coming to see you, anyhow, Georgiana,\" said Fitzwilliam,\n\"but I am very busy, you know--I do not go out much; and you live in a\nperpetual whirl of gaiety, I expect.\" He smiled as he spoke, and\nGeorgiana tried to answer in the same spirit, telling him that they had\na good many plans, and people were very kind, but she was not really in\na whirl, in fact, the very next morning she was leaving for Grosvenor\nStreet for a few days, to spend them quietly with her old friend Mrs.\nAnnesley, who lived in Hans Place, quite away from the bustle of London.\n\n\"Mrs. Annesley?\" repeated Fitzwilliam; \"of course I remember her; she\nwill enjoy having you, but how have Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley become\nreconciled to parting with you even for a week?\"\n\nGeorgiana explained hurriedly that it had been quite a sudden\nengagement; her old friend had been to see her, and had begged for a\nshort visit from her, if possible, for Mrs. Annesley was on the point of\ngoing to India, to live with a married son who had lost his wife, and\nshe might not have the opportunity of seeing her former pupil again for\nmany years. Georgiana had been happy in the opportunity of going to her\nfriend at such a time; her present hostesses had acquiesced, and a week\nwas to be spared to Mrs. Annesley.\n\n\"But it will be made up in Grosvenor Street next month, I assume,\" said\nColonel Fitzwilliam.\n\n\"I hardly know--I believe Elizabeth and my brother want me at home again\nsoon--but of course I like being here too,\" said Georgiana, stumbling\nover her words, and feeling that she was disgracing herself. If only\nCaroline would not stand there and seem to be observing them so closely!\nShe did not believe it would be so distressing to talk to Cousin Robert\nif only they could be together somewhere among strangers. This thought\nimpelled her to ask him, quite at random, for she had every reason to\nknow what his reply would be, whether he was going to Mrs. Knightley's\nball.\n\n\"I am afraid not, Georgiana. I think I am getting too old for balls; but\nI wish you a great deal of pleasure there.\"\n\n\"Oh, Cousin Robert, you are not too old, but you--\" she checked herself\nin this impetuous speech, and ended rather confusedly, \"but you look\ntired\"; which was not what she would have wished to say.\n\nHer cousin glanced kindly at her, but turned her remark off with a\nlaugh; and as he seemed about to move away, Georgiana, in desperation,\nand astonished at herself, said timidly: \"I hope we may meet again, even\nthough you do not go to balls.\"\n\n\"I hope so, too, Georgiana. But of course we shall. I must come some\nmorning and take you all to Kensington Gardens.\"\n\nGeorgiana felt that this would not be a great improvement on the present\nsituation, but she could not say any more, and supposed their\nconversation was at an end, when Fitzwilliam, who had made a step from\nher, seemed struck with a sudden idea, and turned to her again, saying:\n\"May I come and call on you at Mrs. Annesley's? She will perhaps\nremember me and--I may not be in town later on.\"\n\nGeorgiana flushed with surprise and pleasure, and her eager assent left\nFitzwilliam in no doubt as to his reception. He stayed only to assure\nhimself of the number of Mrs. Annesley's house, then bowed and walked\nrapidly away, as Miss Bingley approached with the evident intention of\nbreaking up their conclave. Georgiana had to submit to a certain amount\nof comment from the sisters, who, while condoling with her for having\nhad to pass through a uncomfortable few minutes, appeared surprised that\nshe should have been able to talk to Colonel Fitzwilliam, but she\nherself felt nothing but happiness in having met her cousin again, and\nfound it possible to think of being on those terms with him that\nElizabeth had predicted.\n\nShe spent a part of the afternoon in writing a long letter to her\nsister, telling her what had happened; but she did not like to send an\naccount of her cousin that might alarm them at home, so she contented\nherself with saying that he was not looking at all well, and that she\nwished Elizabeth would persuade him to go down to Pemberley, as he must\nbe working too hard in London. She concluded her writing with the words,\n\"I will leave this open till to-morrow, dear Elizabeth, that I may tell\nyou about the ball, and how Kitty looked.\"\n\nKitty, indeed, was the chief subject of her thoughts when they dwelt\nupon the prospect of the evening, and when the time for dressing arrived\nKitty's rose-coloured silk occupied her mind far more than her own white\nsatin and pearls. When Mr. and Mrs. Hurst's party entered the ante-room\nwhere Mrs. Knightley was receiving her guests, the two girls managed to\nexchange a few words, and Georgiana gathered that the hero of the\nevening had not yet appeared, but Kitty was separated from her by the\ncrowd of arrivals, and so it eventually came about that it was their\nhostess who performed the introduction of Mr. William Price to Miss\nDarcy.\n\nGeorgiana's first thought, when she looked at the noble brow and clear\nblue eye of the young man, was that Kitty's attachment was easily\nunderstood, and each moment that she spent in his company strengthened\nthat assurance. She was desirous of liking him, eager to find everything\nto praise in the admired--and perhaps the admirer--of her friend, and\nthe opportunity came at once in the infectious gaiety and good spirits\nof the young man and the unaffected warmth of his manner.\n\nHe asked her for the honour of her hand in several dances; but the first\ntwo, she noticed, he danced with Kitty, and from the sparkle in Kitty's\neye, and her quick movement as he approached to claim them, Georgiana\nconjectured that the engagement had been made previously.\n\nWhen Georgiana's turn came, among the excellencies that she discovered\nin her partner was that of being a perfect dancer; and, moreover, one\nwho moved through the set as if he enjoyed every step. Somewhat shyly\nshe commented on this.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, Miss Darcy, I am fond of dancing; I began very early, when\nI was such a small person that you probably wouldn't have seen me in a\nroom, much less have danced with me. We all used to jump about as\nchildren, I believe; and on board ship one somehow managed to learn, so\nas to be ready for the balls.\"\n\n\"Were there balls so often?\" asked Georgiana.\n\n\"Yes; wherever we were stationed somebody always seized the opportunity\nto give a ball, either a private person, or the Governor, or the\nregiment, or someone. There seems to be a connection established in\npeople's minds between naval men and dancing; anyhow, as soon as there\nwere a few days' quiet, someone would produce musicians and a waxed\nfloor, and we were expected to go and perform. So I decided that I had\nbetter like it.\"\n\n\"You are a very fortunate person to be able to be able to like what you\nhave to do,\" said Georgiana, highly diverted.\n\n\"It is not a matter of fortune, is it? Anybody can do it,\" rejoined\nWilliam Price. \"I am sure you can, Miss Darcy.\"\n\n\"No, indeed; I dislike very much some things I have to do.\"\n\n\"But if you found you positively had to do them, and there was no way\nout, then you would decide to like them, would you not? It would make\nthem so much easier.\"\n\nThis was a new idea to Georgiana, and she considered it a little before\nreplying, with a smile: \"I am sure there are some things I should never\nlike doing, such as sitting on the back seat of a carriage.\"\n\n\"I know that it is disagreeable to some people, but I am sure, if one\nthought long enough, one could find a way to make it less so,\" said the\nyoung lieutenant, with great earnestness. \"For instance\"--he\nconsidered--\"when the window was open the rain and wind would not do so\nmuch damage to the feathers in a lady's bonnet as if she were opposite;\nand at night one could shut one's eyes and imagine one was travelling\nforwards--it would be difficult to tell the difference.\" He looked\ninquiringly at Georgiana, who was so much entertained by his arguments\nthat she said, laughingly: \"I was right in calling you fortunate, Mr.\nPrice, for you seemed to have secured a sovereign remedy against all\nills. Do tell me how you would console yourself if you slipped down now\nand broke your leg, so that you could not dance any more for a long\ntime? I should like to know whether your principle always holds good.\"\n\n\"Now, Miss Darcy, you are driving me into a corner. I only said if I\npositively had to do the distasteful thing and there was no way out. I\nbeg to inform you in the plainest language that there is a way out of\nyour suggestion--that is, not to fall and break my leg, and it is the\nway I mean to adopt. But if such a thing did happen to me, I should\ncertainly try to console myself--as yet I am not quite sure how--yes, I\nhave thought of a method, but I do not think I had better tell you what\nit is.\"\n\n\"He means he would have Kitty to sit beside him and talk to him,\"\nthought Georgiana. \"I wonder what he would be like if he were ill? He\nwould have just the same merry smile, I believe.\" Aloud she said: \"I am\nnot so strong-minded as you, Mr. Price, I'm afraid. I should never be\nable to think of any way of consoling myself for a broken leg.\"\n\n\"I hope you will never have to endure anything one-twentieth a part\ndisagreeable, Miss Darcy,\" her partner replied, dropping his gay manner\nfor a moment. \"Although it helped me to get through my examinations,\neven now I cannot think very kindly of it.\"\n\n\"Were you--has it actually happened to you?\" exclaimed Georgiana, with a\nhorrified face; and she never felt less pleasure at the arrival of a new\npartner than at that moment. Most unwillingly she placed her arm in his\nto be led away, wanting far more to hear the history of William Price's\nmisfortune; while the young man, full of concern at having startled her,\nwalked a few steps beside her to say: \"It is all right, Miss Darcy,\nbecause, you see, that guarantees that it will not happen again\nto-night.\"\n\nBingley, who was her partner, asked the name of her companion, and\nGeorgiana told what she knew of him, describing him as Kitty's friend.\nBingley recollected having heard of him from Kitty, and pleased with his\nappearance, and always attracted by a new face, expressed a wish to know\nhim, and Georgiana looked forward to making the introduction when her\ndances with Bingley should be over. This, however, was not to be. Kitty\nand Mr. Price were dancing together, and occasionally passed them in the\nset, when Georgiana could observe her friend's flushed cheek and air of\nradiant happiness; but at its conclusion they were swept away in a\ncrowd, and Bingley and Georgiana, looking round for chairs, were\naccosted by Mr. Knightley, with the request to present Mr. and Mrs.\nYates, who were anxious to know them. The name was unfamiliar to both,\nand so were the faces of the couple who approached--Mr. Yates with his\nusual aspect of complete self-satisfaction, and his wife, a woman of\nfashion, with a considerable share of good looks, but an expression of\ncountenance from which weariness and impatience were never long absent.\n\nThe lady fell to Bingley's share, and Georgiana, on her part, learned\nfrom Mr. Yates that he had heard her name and wished for the pleasure of\nher acquaintance, as he had already made that of her brother and sister\nin Bath. Georgiana replied to inquiries after their health and Colonel\nFitzwilliam's, whom, Mr. Yates told her, he knew very well indeed, and\nhe desired to send his compliments to the Colonel, if Miss Darcy should\nbe seeing him. \"He is in London, I believe?\" Georgiana assented.\n\n\"Ah, yes, I understood that; and the lady is in town, too, I fancy.\"\nGeorgiana's look in reply to this was so blank that Mr. Yates, evidently\nnot caring to trust himself in the deep waters of explanation,\ncontinued: \"Do present him my cordial regards, and say I hope he has\nforgiven me. I was so unfortunate as to do him a little disservice, but\nit was easily put right; I saw to that myself. Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\nI am sure, had made _amende honorable_. You know Lady Catherine, Miss\nDarcy? Your aunt? Of course, I beg your pardon; I should have\nrecollected. Do, pray, remember me to her, too. You were not in Bath\nthis year, were you? Well, you did not lose much; I have known\npleasanter seasons.\"\n\nGeorgiana only bowed; Mr. Yates's familiar allusion to Colonel\nFitzwilliam had not pleased her, and an instinct, which she had not time\nto analyse, led her to connect it with her cousin's depressed spirits.\nThe next moment her companion introduced a more welcome subject by\nsaying: \"I think I saw you dancing with my young cousin, William Price;\na smart young fellow, is he not?\"\n\n\"Is he your cousin?\" asked Georgiana, in some surprise.\n\n\"Yes, or rather, my wife's, through the mother; but we have all known\nhim for years, he seems quite like one of ourselves, and spends half his\ntime at our house when in town. Though I often tell my wife it is no\ncompliment to us, for he is for ever playing with our children; we\ncannot get him out of the nursery.\"\n\nGeorgiana felt that this was just as it should be; Mr. Price's being\nfond of the children accorded him well with the \"merry, kind smile\" that\nwas so characteristic of him. She ventured upon an inquiry as to his\nnaval career, and Mr. Yates, who liked nothing better than to be talking\neither of himself or of those belonging to him, immediately entered upon\na description of William's notable conduct at the battle of St. Domingo,\nand the extraordinary courage he had displayed in the taking of a French\nship and in defending the colours of his own. Bingley's attention was\ncaught, and Georgiana was grateful to him for asking questions to\nprolong the story, and for interpolating expressions of admiration which\nshe felt but could not utter. The more she saw and heard of him, the\nmore delighted she was with the young hero, for such he now appeared to\nbe; and the more she commended Kitty's good sense in bestowing her\ndevotion upon such a worthy object. She looked forward to further\nopportunities of hearing from Mr. Price's own lips the account of some\nof his adventures; but recollecting that if events took the much-desired\ncourse there would be plenty of such opportunities, she decided that it\nwould be best to employ the remainder of the time which she might spend\nin his company that evening by discoursing of Kitty, in the hope of\ngaining some assurance of the strength of his inclinations. He knew her\nto be Kitty's friend, and the subject of Kitty would naturally become\nthe chief bond between them when they came to know each other a little\nbetter.\n\nShortly after supper, William Price claimed her hand for a second time;\nand at the first interval in the dance long enough for any connected\nconversation, Georgiana began: \"Who is that dancing with Miss Bennet? Do\nyou know, Mr. Price?\"\n\n\"It is a Mr. Churchill, a great friend of the Knightleys. I believe he\nis rather agreeable, but Miss Bennet tells me she does not like him,\"\nreplied William Price, laughing.\n\n\"Why should she not like him, I wonder?\" asked Georgiana.\n\n\"Oh, I hardly know. Just a fancy, I think. He and I had a great set-to\nhere one day--an argument, I mean; and I was fairly worsted--it was\nabout foxhunting, so perhaps I deserved to be; but Miss Bennet very\nkindly took my side, and was quite vexed with Mr. Churchill when he\nretired with the honours of war.\"\n\n\"Kitty is so loyal to her friends,\" said Georgiana.\n\n\"Yes, she is a delightful girl, and Mrs. Knightley, too, is the kindest\nperson imaginable. She has been so good to both my brother and myself,\nand I have never enjoyed my leave so much.\"\n\n\"It must be a very pleasant house to stay in,\" said Georgiana. \"Miss\nBennet is very sorry to be going away, I know.\"\n\n\"Yes, is it not a pity she has to go? And down to the depths of the\ncountry, too. I must not disparage it, Miss Darcy, for I am reminded\nthat it is your home as well; but when people go so far off one is\ndesperately afraid of not seeing them again. You are not leaving town\nwith Miss Bennet, are you?\"\n\nGeorgiana was explaining their respective plans when the summons came\nfor them to rejoin the set; but an interruption soon occurred in the\nshape of a slight accident. A lady dancing next to William Price, in\nturning sharply, trod upon her dress, with the result that she slipped\nand fell upon the polished floor with her foot twisted under her. The\nyoung lieutenant sprang forward, lifted her with skillful and gentle\ntouch, and carried her, pale and suffering, to an adjoining room, where\nMrs. Knightley and several friends hastened to her aid. A servant was\nsent for a surgeon, and William Price returned to Georgiana with the\nnews that, pending his arrival, the lady was being treated for what\nappeared to be a severe sprain.\n\n\"Poor thing!\" said Georgiana, trembling. \"I am so sorry for her. It must\nhave caused intense pain. I was afraid she might have broken it.\"\n\n\"No, it is bad enough, but fortunately it is not broken; I could\nperceive that,\" replied the young man. \"You must not prognosticate such\nsad things, Miss Darcy; you see they very nearly come true.\"\n\nGeorgiana looked into his face for enlightenment, then broke into a\nsmile. \"Oh, Mr. Price, you are unkind to assume that I was responsible\nfor it. I only suggested a broken leg, and it was you who said it had\nbeen a reality in your case. How did it happen? Was it in action?\"\n\nWilliam led her to a seat, as the incident had unnerved her for more\ndancing, but could not be persuaded to give a narrative in the style of\nMr. Yates; he only laughed and said that it had been about as glorious\nan affair as falling down in a ball-room. \"One of our fellows had\nfoolishly got himself into a very awkward place at the storming of a\nfort, and I was so stupid as to get in the way of a shower of falling\nrocks, one of which, when it reached me, decided to stay as close to me\nas it could; so I was severely reprimanded, and had to spend six weeks\nin hospital at the very busiest time.\"\n\nGeorgiana listened with interest, certain that there was another version\nof the story which would show her companion up in a different light, and\nshe inquired: \"What did you say about examinations?\"\n\n\"Only that I had some books, and a good friend who helped me to the\nutmost of his power, so that while I was lying by I contrived to work up\nmy subject enough to have scraped through.\"\n\nThey talked for some time longer, until William had to go in search of\nhis next partner, while Georgiana was carried off by her hostess, who\nplaced her at a small table to drink coffee with herself and Mr. and\nMrs. Gardiner. The Gardiners were, of course, no strangers to Georgiana,\nand she showed the pleasure she felt in meeting them again.\n\n\"Is it not kind of Mrs. Gardiner to have lent Kitty to me for so long,\nMiss Darcy?\" said Mrs. Knightley. \"I feel I can ill spare her now; I\nshall miss her after the happy time we have had together.\"\n\nGeorgiana said what was proper, and Mrs. Gardiner added: \"Perhaps she\nwill be able to come to you another year.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I hope so. I should like her to come any time; but another\nyear, you know, she may not be so free; the claims of a house of her own\nmay be paramount.\"\n\n\"Certainly they may be; but it seems early to anticipate that,\" said\nMrs. Gardiner.\n\n\"Early? Oh, no, I do not think so. I shall not be at all surprised to be\nasked to help in buying Kitty's wedding clothes before Christmas,\"\nreturned Mrs. Knightley, smiling mysteriously.\n\nMrs. Gardiner expressed inquiring surprise, while Georgiana listened\nwith interest for what Mrs. Knightley would say, regarding her as the\nchief authority in the affair, as far as it had gone.\n\nHer hostess proceeded: \"It is quite between ourselves, you know, Mrs.\nGardiner; I know I am perfectly safe in mentioning it, as you are\nKitty's aunt and Miss Darcy her greatest friend; and you can imagine\nwhether it is a pleasure to me to find that two young people in whom I\nam interested are so much interested in each other.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said Mrs. Gardiner; \"but pray enlighten me, Mrs.\nKnightley, as to who the other person is.\"\n\n\"You have met him to-night, Mrs. Gardiner, the young naval officer, Mr.\nPrice, whom I introduced to you.\"\n\nMrs. Gardiner was very anxious to learn more particulars, and Mrs.\nKnightley gave her full information as to William Price's career and\nprospects, while as to Kitty, she affirmed she had every reason to\nbelieve that both were equally attracted, and that an engagement would\nshortly be formed between them, subject to the approval of their\nfriends.\n\nMrs. Gardiner agreed that it was very good news if the young man was all\nMrs. Knightley believed him, and remarked what a delight it would be to\nher sister, Mrs. Bennet, who had always wanted Kitty to be settled.\n\n\"Mr. Price _is_ all we think him, I can assure you; Mr. Knightley will\nanswer for him. But, pray, do not mention a word of this to anyone; let\nit not go beyond us four; I am most desirous that the affair should pass\nto its easy and natural conclusion.\"\n\n\"I quite understand that, and of course we shall wait until Kitty tells\nus,\" said her aunt. \"What do you think of it all, Miss Darcy? Has Kitty\nmentioned the matter to you?\"\n\nGeorgiana replied that she had, and on further questioning owned that\nshe felt sure that if what Mrs. Knightley expected came to pass, it\nwould make Kitty very happy. Mrs. Knightley called upon her to join in\ncommendations of the young man, and this she could sincerely do; and she\nrose from the table feeling as if everything were settled, and it only\nremained to congratulate the two persons most concerned.\n\nA minute later she met Kitty, flying in search of her. Kitty seized her\nfriend's hand and drew her into a quiet corner of Mrs. Knightley's\nmorning-room, where the two girls could seat themselves on a sofa partly\nhidden by a screen and be quite secluded.\n\n\"I wanted so much to see you before I went, Georgiana,\" began Kitty in\nan excited undertone. \"I thought I should never get to you, and this is\nmy last chance, as we start so early on Friday. Now do tell me what you\nthink of him. You can judge now, cannot you? Is he not delightful? Is he\nnot handsome, and a noble creature? Is he not all I said?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, dear Kitty, he is,\" responded Georgiana, with tender\nsympathy. \"I can quite understand your feelings. I am sure anyone would\nbe very proud to have gained the affection of such a man.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am so glad to hear you say so. Do you think I have gained it?\nSometimes I think so; sometimes I am not sure. Mrs. Knightley thinks I\nhave.\"\n\n\"I know she does; I have heard her say so, and she would not mislead\nyou, Kitty, I am sure. She cares so much for your welfare.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, she has been very kind. I cannot tell you what I should\nhave done without her. She has done everything, she thinks of\neverything. To-night, when she was arranging the supper partners, I was\nstanding near him, but not very near, and he had not asked me; I suppose\nhe was waiting to see if he might, as we had already danced together a\ngreat deal, and she looked up from her list and said: 'And Mr. Price, I\ndo not think I have put anyone down for you: will you take Miss Bennet?'\nin that kind way, not to make me feel uncomfortable, as if it had been\nplanned. So he came and offered me his arm with such an air! And, after\nall, we did not talk much at supper; I was too happy, but when I asked\nhim if he liked my dress, he paid me such an elegant compliment on\nit--something about a rose.\"\n\n\"He is a most agreeable companion,\" said Georgiana. \"I should never tire\nof hearing him converse. The marvellous adventures he has had! It is\nlike a glimpse of a new world to meet a person who has actually been\nthrough those things, and who describes them with such modesty and\nsimplicity. Such a man seldom comes into our quiet lives.\"\n\n\"Oh, but they are so horrible, it quite frightens me to hear about them;\nif I were married to him I would never let him go to sea again, for fear\nof his coming back without an arm, or a leg, or an eye.\"\n\n\"But it is his profession, Kitty.\"\n\n\"I know, but it is a horrid profession, the only thing about him that I\ndon't like, except for the uniform, and a man in a black coat looks\npositively nothing beside him.\"\n\n\"Oh, Kitty, as if the uniform mattered! Do not let me hear you talk so\nfoolishly,\" said Georgiana, really pained.\n\n\"Well, perhaps it is foolish, but it does make a difference, you know.\nBingley has been teasing me half the evening about a young man that he\nsays they have got for me down in the country, whom I shall be sure to\nlike, the Rector of Kympton, I believe. As if I could possibly look at a\nclergyman after knowing William Price.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is not fair to compare two such different types of men, but\nMr. Morland is very nice, Kitty; I am sure you will think so.\"\n\n\"I am sure I shall not; I don't want to see him: how can I think anyone\nnice when I am away from here? Oh, if I could only see Price once more,\njust once more, to make sure; but as he says, how can one ever see\nanybody down in the wilds of Derbyshire?\"\n\n\"Kitty, here is the music beginning again, and we shall be asked for,\"\nsaid Georgiana, standing up. \"Do not be unhappy or over-anxious about\nthis, and do not show too much what you feel, for I am sure it will all\ncome out right if you have patience.\"\n\n\"Do you really think it is so? That is such a comfort; but I wish he had\nspoken to-night. Mrs. Knightley thought he would.\"\n\n\"Dear Kitty, whenever it comes, I wish you all the happiness in the\nworld; write to me very fully, and, as I said, have patience and\nself-command. Now we really ought to go.\"\n\nKitty pressed her friend's hand, and Georgiana tried to calm her as they\nwalked back to the ball-room, by talking on indifferent topics, for she\nfeared the girl's burning cheeks and nervous manner would betray her\nagitation and its cause. Miss Bingley met them as they entered the room,\nand asked Georgiana if she was ready to go, as Mrs. Hurst seemed\ninclined for it.\n\n\"Yes, I am quite ready,\" said Georgiana. \"I think I am engaged to Mr.\nBingley for another dance, but he will not mind missing it.\"\n\n\"Charles is over there, talking to Mr. Price, but I have told him we\nwant to go, so he will be expecting us,\" said Miss Bingley, and led the\nway across the room, Kitty not unnaturally following. Mr. Bingley\nwelcomed them warmly, calling out: \"Here, Kitty, come and add your\nentreaties to mine. I want this young gentleman to come down to\nDesborough and shoot our pheasants in November, but he is not sure if he\ncan manage it; I never heard such nonsense. If anyone is entitled to ask\nfor leave when he wants it, I should think he is.\"\n\nKitty was rendered perfectly incapable of speech for the first moment\nafter hearing these words; never had a wish been so suddenly and\ngloriously placed in the way of accomplishment; but she found an\nunexpected ally in Miss Bingley, who supported her brother's invitation,\nhaving, like him, been attracted by the young lieutenant's agreeable\ndemeanour and high reputation. William Price stood still, looking\ndiffidently from one to another, and expressing in disjointed sentences\nhis gratitude, his uncertainty, and his extreme pleasure should he be\nable to accept. Mr. Bingley exerted all his powers of persuasion, and\nKitty's bright eyes shot glances not less eloquent. Georgiana turned a\nlittle away, feeling suddenly very tired and spiritless, and Mr. and\nMrs. Hurst, who came up at that moment, remarked on it.\n\n\"Georgiana tired?\" exclaimed Bingley; \"then let us go at once. You are\nnot used to these late hours, and I don't know what Mrs. Darcy will say\nto me if I take them a poor account of you. We are all neighbours in the\ncountry, you know, Mr. Price. Then that is settled? You will come to us\nif you can possibly get away, and I hope nothing will prevent it. You do\nnot expect to receive the command of the Mediterranean squadron, do\nyou?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied William, laughing, \"neither that nor any other\ncommand this year, I am afraid.\"\n\n\"Well, well, I wish you luck. Shall I see you again before I leave\ntown?\"\n\nWilliam was beginning to reply negatively, when Miss Bingley, who was\nleading the whole party towards the cloak-room, turned and asked Mr.\nPrice if he would not come and see them some time in Grosvenor Street.\nShe called on her sister to ratify the invitation, which Mrs. Hurst did,\nand it was courteously accepted. There followed a confusion of good-byes\nand a getting of cloaks, and the three ladies were placed in the coach\nwhile the two gentlemen prepared to walk. Georgiana had warmly embraced\nKitty at parting, and had intimated that she knew how much the\narrangement by Bingley meant to her friend; and her last impression of\nMrs. Knightley's ball was of William Price waving farewell in the\ndoorway and then ascending the steps to where Kitty awaited him in the\nvestibule.\n\n\n\n\nChapter X\n\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam had come to London because he thought it was the\nplace where he would be most likely to meet Miss Crawford again, and he\nhad taken up literary work merely to pass away the time until that\nlonged-for event should occur. Two months had elapsed before he heard of\nher arrival, with her sister, but it was not many days after that he\ncontrived to be present at the house of a mutual friend, where he knew\nher to be expected. Her manner of greeting him on this occasion was not\nfree from embarrassment; it was neither cordial nor unfriendly, and so\nbrief was the encounter that he could discover but little from it of the\nstate of her mind towards him. Another casual meeting seemed to promise\nmore hopefully, but hardly had they exchanged a few sentences when the\nappearance of Sir Walter and Miss Elliot turned the conversation into\nchannels more congenial to the new-comers, and Colonel Fitzwilliam was\nforced to stand aside and see Miss Crawford taken possession of without\nany semblance of unwillingness on her part. He then devoted himself to\nMrs. Grant, and tried to propose an expedition, a theatre party, but\nthat lady hesitatingly replied that she could arrange nothing without\nher sister. Colonel Fitzwilliam applied for permission to call, which\nwas readily accorded, but on availing himself of it the following day\nonly learned that the ladies were gone to Richmond with a party. The\nmanservant obliged him, unasked, with the information that it was Mr.\nCrawford's party, and the Colonel was left to speculate gloomily on the\nchances of Sir Walter Elliot being one of the number, and what was of\ngreater import whether, if it was so, it was with Miss Crawford's\napproval.\n\nHe had gone to call on the Hursts after leaving Mrs. Grant's house, and\nhad not again seen the object of his thoughts and hopes, when, a few\ndays later, he directed his steps towards Mrs. Annesley's residence in\nHans Place. He could scarcely believe it was but three months since the\nseverance of his engagement with Georgiana, it seemed to have retreated\nso far into the background of events, but he had pondered earnestly over\ntheir interview in Grosvenor Street, and from her demeanour had\nconcluded that his presence was not objectionable to her, so that any\nfurther meeting might help to re-establish their old cousinly relations,\na result which their friends would rejoice in. It was therefore with a\ntolerably easy mind that was ushered into the presence of the two\nladies, and found Georgiana in great good looks and far less shy and\nconfused than on the previous occasion; indeed, in a few moments any\nawkwardness between them seemed to have quite melted away, and she was\nreadily answering his questions about Mrs. Knightley's ball.\n\n\"It certainly seems to have been a great success, for I never knew you\nso enthusiastic about a ball before, Georgiana,\" said her cousin,\nsmiling. \"It was better than the Bath assemblies, I gather?\"\n\n\"Oh--Bath!\" exclaimed Georgiana, with a note of contempt in her voice\nwhich spoke volumes. \"You laugh at me, Cousin Robert, but it was a\nbeautiful ball. Even Mr. Bingley said so, and he must have been to a\ngreat number.\"\n\n\"Hundreds, if not thousands, I should think,\" returned her cousin.\n\"Bingley's shoemaker must have made a fortune. But who were the partners\nwho contributed to such enjoyment? for they are usually the really\nimportant part. Two Mr. Prices you have mentioned, Captain Carter and\nMr. Dixon; who else?\"\n\n\"Oh, I forget who else; Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley, of course, and Mr.\nKnightley, but he was very grave and terrible, I was almost too\nfrightened to move, and Mr. Gardiner, and then there was Mr. Yates, but\nI did not dance with him. Do you remember him, Cousin Robert? he said he\nknew you at Bath.\"\n\nGeorgiana had been so disagreeably struck by Mr. Yates's way of speaking\nof her relatives whom he had met, that she had not intended to mention\nit to Colonel Fitzwilliam, but the rest of his talk had eradicated his\nfirst impression, and she had unguardedly given utterance to his name.\nFruitless regret and vexation overcame her when, glancing up at her\ncousin, she perceived his countenance darken, and noted the change in\nhis voice as he replied, with an effort: \"Yes, we did meet in Bath, but\nnot in the pleasantest of circumstances. Mr. Yates may be a more\nagreeable man away from the companions he then had.\"\n\n\"I do not think he was particularly agreeable,\" said Georgiana,\nfalteringly, \"but I thought--he appeared to me to be an interesting\ntalker.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is quite his line; if Yates can do nothing else he can\ncertainly use his tongue,\" replied Colonel Fitzwilliam, not without\nbitterness. \"But do not let us concern ourselves with him, Georgiana;\nwhat about the walk in Kensington Gardens that we had thought of? Will\nMrs. Annesley very kindly let me escort you both there this delightfully\nfine morning?\"\n\nMrs. Annesley willingly acceded, and the two ladies having attired\nthemselves, a hackney coach was called, which conveyed them a mile on\ntheir way towards Kensington Place. Georgiana was somewhat silent during\nthe drive. She did not wish to speculate on her cousin's private\naffairs, but having been the innocent cause of recalling painful\nthoughts to him inevitably produced the wish to atone, to help; and she\nfound herself wondering, while trying not to wonder, what could possibly\nbe the connection between Mr. Yates, Cousin Robert and a lady in Bath\nnow said to be in London. To be sure, it was none of her business, she\nhad no right to wish to know, and yet she did wish she knew whether that\nhad anything to do with Cousin Robert's looking so sad and worn.\nStay--that letter of Lady Catherine's which her brother had read\naloud--a lady in Bath, a friend of Elizabeth's--a\nmisunderstanding--Georgiana felt for one instant, with a thrill of fear\nand excitement, as though she had laid hold of the thread; and was\nalmost glad when the stopping of the carriage obliged her to let it go,\nby scattering her thoughts and her bringing her back to the present\nmoment. She reproached herself for prying into others' secrets, and\npressing close to Mrs. Annesley's side, she eagerly responded to that\nlady's eulogies of the beautiful scene around them. The gardens were\nindeed looking their best in the glory of their June array, and crowds\nof well-dressed persons strolling gaily about added to the general sense\nof brilliancy and festivity.\n\nThey had taken a few turns, and Fitzwilliam had greeted several of his\nacquaintances, while Georgiana was beginning to think that she, too,\nmight see someone she knew, when her attention was arrested by some\ncomments of Mrs. Annesley's, made in a low voice, on the singular beauty\nof a young lady who was approaching them, escorted by two gentlemen. The\nlady was dark and extremely animated, and her fine eyes seemed to be\nglancing in the direction of their party. As the two groups slowly\npassed each other, Colonel Fitzwilliam's bow was acknowledged by the\nlady and her friends, and she half paused, as if about to speak, but\npassed on without doing so. Mrs. Annesley, seeing the recognition, made\na laughing apology to her companion. \"I beg your pardon, Colonel\nFitzwilliam, I did not know you knew that lady, but really, she is such\na lovely creature that one cannot help remarking on it.\"\n\n\"I am quite of your opinion Mrs. Annesley,\" returned the Colonel, and\nGeorgiana saw that though he endeavoured to speak lightly something had\nhappened which necessitated the exercise of a degree of self-command.\n\"It is very obliging of you to voice sentiments which I am always\nwanting to put into words when I meet Miss Crawford. Although no words\ncan exactly describe her special charm.\"\n\n\"It is her expression, is it not?\" said Mrs. Annesley, \"so full of\nchanging life and brightness, and that vivid complexion, and graceful\ncarriage of the head. All that one can see at a glance. And I imagine we\nare not in the minority in admiring her.\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"she holds quite a little court.\"\n\nHe was interrupted by a gentleman who detained him for a moment, and the\nladies walked on, Georgiana's mind full of tumultuous thoughts. She had\nrecollected the name Crawford in a moment as being that of Elizabeth's\nfriend to whom Lady Catherine had behaved so unkindly, but she did not\nlike to admit her knowledge, for fear it might be painful to her cousin\nto have the whole chain of circumstances discussed. What they were,\nGeorgiana could not help longing to know, but the only one that was\nquite clear to her was her cousin's deep admiration for this lady. Her\nheart went out in sympathy to him, both for his attachment and for the\ndifficulties in his way, if difficulties there were. Did Miss Crawford\nperhaps not care for him? Yet she had looked as if she wanted to speak.\nWere there friends or relations influencing her? He had alluded to \"a\nlittle court.\" But how could anyone separate Miss Crawford from Colonel\nFitzwilliam, if she really loved him, he so noble, so kind, so true?\nGeorgiana blushed deeply at her thoughts, perceiving the rapid pace at\nwhich they had led her on, and the somewhat inconsistent conclusion that\nthey had reached, but their very sincerity reassured her, in the\nknowledge that her own love for Colonel Fitzwilliam was the sisterly\nlove that longed to see him happily and suitably united. No idea crossed\nher mind of helping towards this end; she had too lowly an opinion of\nher own powers as a force in other persons' lives; her only wish was for\nan opportunity of showing her sympathy towards her cousin in some\npractical form. In vain she tried to plan how this might be done, for\nshe could not speak of it until he had opened his heart to her, a most\nunlikely thing to happen, and not at all could it be mentioned before\nMrs. Annesley.\n\nFortune seemed to favour her, for when Colonel Fitzwilliam rejoined\nthem, Mrs. Annesley confessed that she felt a little tired, the heat was\nso great, and she would like to rest a while. \"But do not come with me,\"\nshe added, as Fitzwilliam instantly proposed moving towards the chairs,\n\"if you are not tired yet, it is much more amusing for you and Georgiana\nto walk about, and probably you would like to go nearer to the music. I\nwill go and sit by my friend Mrs. Sackville, whom I see over there,\nuntil you are ready.\"\n\nThe cousins accordingly found themselves together, and Georgiana, hardly\nknowing how to begin, but feeling no time was to be lost, broke silence\nagain after a few minutes after a few minutes by saying timidly: \"I\nthink I have heard Elizabeth speak of Miss Crawford; you all knew her in\nBath, did you not?\"\n\n\"Have you indeed? That is good,\" exclaimed Colonel Fitzwilliam. \"I had\nforgotten that you would know her name. Yes, we all met in Bath.\" He\nseemed about to say more, but after a pause concluded with: \"Ask\nElizabeth to tell you about her.\"\n\nGeorgiana was disappointed, but told herself that she could not have\nexpected anything else. How could he make a confidant of her, who had\nshown herself unworthy of any trust.\n\nThey walked on for some little distance, until Fitzwilliam, observing\ntwo vacant seats in a group of chairs, placed close to the edge of the\ngrass, asked Georgiana if she would like to sit down for a little before\nturning back. It was a charming spot, in the shade of a tree and\nimmediately facing a large sheet of artificial water, and Georgiana\nwillingly assented, remarking: \"How fortunate that we should be able to\nget two chairs. They seem to be nearly all occupied.\"\n\n\"It is generally so; people come and sit here the whole morning when it\nis so fine and warm,\" returned Fitzwilliam, placing himself at her side,\nbut not resuming their conversation of a few moments before. Georgiana\nwas not content to be silent, and her cousin was wrapped in thoughts of\nMiss Crawford and did not dream of the anxious solicitude for him in\nGeorgiana's heart. The other man in Mary's party, he reflected, must be\nher brother, Henry Crawford; there was a slight resemblance; besides, he\nanswered to the description Mary had given of him. How well he\nremembered her laughing looks and tones as she uttered it: \"Henry is not\ntall, Colonel Fitzwilliam, no, I allow him every other imaginable\nbeauty, but he is not tall; thin, dark, rather plain; of course, to me,\nsingularly handsome; did I not say so? Do you think you would recognize\nhim if you saw him?\" And the Colonel did see him now, for the second\ntime, a few steps away, approaching with his sister, who walked between\nhim and Sir Walter Elliot, as before.\n\nMary glanced towards Miss Darcy, and in an instant the Colonel was at\nher side. \"How do you do, Miss Crawford? I was sorry to miss you the\nother morning when I called. Would you allow me to present to you my\ncousin, Miss Darcy? She has heard of you from her brother and sister.\"\n\nMary coloured deeply as she returned his salutation, but immediately\ncomplied with his request, pausing only to say to her brother in a low\nvoice: \"Henry, please walk on; do not wait for me.\" To Georgiana it was\nsuch a surprise and delight to see Miss Crawford being brought towards\nher, and to find a wish granted which she had scarcely dared to\nformulate, that instead of being exceedingly shy, as she would\nordinarily have been, she forgot to think of herself, and rising and\nlooking into Miss Crawford's lovely and expressive face, she entered\nfully into what she believed her cousin to be feeling towards its owner.\nIn reality the shyness was on Mary's side, for she could not help in\nseeing in Colonel Fitzwilliam's action another proof of the generosity\nand devotion of the friend whom she had exiled from her. A few words\npassed between them all three about the beauty of the day and their\nsurroundings, then Miss Crawford, turning to Georgiana, inquired after\nMr. and Mrs. Darcy. This was a subject to unloose Georgiana's tongue and\ndrew forth animated replies, and Mary, still addressing her, made a few\ncivil inquiries about her journey to town and the probable duration of\nher visit. It was Colonel Fitzwilliam who presently begged Miss Crawford\nto take his seat, which, after a slight demur, no other chair being\nwithin sight, she consented to do. He remained standing near them for a\nfew moments, and then moved a little distance, thinking they might be\nable to talk more comfortably if left to themselves.\n\n\"You are staying with your aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh?\" asked Miss\nCrawford, when he was out of earshot.\n\n\"No,\" replied Georgiana, \"my aunt is not in town. For the moment I am\nwith my old governess, Mrs. Annesley, but I am really on a visit to some\nother friends, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley.\"\n\n\"I see; and your cousin is with you there just now?\" Mary pursued.\n\n\"Oh, no, no, no,\" said Georgiana, smiling, \"no, he has been living in\ntown by himself for some time. You have not happened to meet him since\nyou were in London?\"\n\nMary answered that she had met Colonel Fitzwilliam once or twice, but\nmurmured something about thinking he and the Darcys were all like one\nfamily. Georgiana assented to this.\n\n\"He is indeed like one of ourselves; my brother and sister are devoted\nto him, and he is the oldest friend I have,\" she replied. \"After my own\nbrother, he is the kindest and best person I have ever met. People do\nnot know for a long time how good he is, because he is so modest and\nretiring.\"\n\nGeorgiana was conscious that she was perhaps transgressing the bounds of\ngood taste in this vehement praise; but she did not care what Miss\nCrawford thought of her, so long as she would think well of her cousin.\nAt all events it appeared that Miss Crawford was not offended, for she\nsmiled faintly and said: \"He is fortunate in having you and Mrs. Darcy\nfor his advocates.\"\n\n\"It is just the same,\" said Georgiana eagerly, \"with whoever speaks of\nhim. His friends are all devoted to him, and he is so staunch to them,\nwhatever they do; he never changes, or fails them when they want him.\"\n\n\"I think I know one who would not fail _him_, Miss Darcy,\" said Miss\nCrawford, still smiling; \"but, indeed,\" she added, as Georgiana turned\naway her head, \"I am sure you are quite right in all you say. Who should\nknow Colonel Fitzwilliam well, if not his old friends? And I know myself\nthat he is even loyal to them when he is angry with them, which is the\ngreat test.\"\n\nGeorgiana could heartily agree, though without understanding Mary's\nallusion. Their talk drifted to other subjects, in the midst of which\nthe Colonel returned and tried to interest Miss Crawford in some such\nplan as he had suggested to her sister. Mary said \"it was kind of him,\"\n\"it would be pleasant,\" without pledging herself to anything; and\nreplied, \"Pray do,\" when he asked if he might call to talk it over; but\nit appeared that she and her sister were so full of engagements that it\nwas doubtful if they would be at home any morning before the end of that\nweek. By this time she had risen, and appeared anxious to return to her\nfriends. Mr. Crawford, indeed, was seen approaching, so Colonel\nFitzwilliam could only bow his adieux, while promising himself the\npleasure of calling early in the following week, for though he would\nhave liked to make Henry Crawford's acquaintance for himself, he did not\nwish to be responsible for introducing him to Georgiana. She, on her\npart, only perceived that Miss Crawford was taking leave, and she\npressed the hand that her new friend extended to her, saying in a low\nvoice: \"It has been such a pleasure--I hope I shall see you again.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I hope we may meet; I should like it,\" responded Mary\ncordially. \"You go about so much that I have no doubt we shall. Pray\nremember me to your sister and Mr. Darcy.\"\n\nGeorgiana promised, and turned away with Colonel Fitzwilliam, but she\nventured to say to her companion nothing more than a few shy words of\nappreciation of Miss Crawford's beauty and charm.\n\n\"I am so glad you like her,\" he replied. \"I thought that you would,\nthough it never occurred to me that we were likely to meet her here.\nElizabeth talked of inviting her to Pemberley, and I hope some day she\nwill. If we can get up a water party, Georgiana, you must come to it. Do\nyou think you could persuade Mrs. Annesley to bring you?\"\n\n\"Indeed I am sure I could, if I am still with her. But I go back to\nGrosvenor Street on Saturday afternoon, you know.\"\n\n\"Well, we must contrive it somehow; I doubt if Miss Bingley would care\nmuch for such simple pleasures.\"\n\nGeorgiana laughed, regarding a river party as a very distinguished and\nelaborate form of entertainment. Their progress towards Mrs. Annesley\nwas slow, as Colonel Fitzwilliam was frequently accosted by some friend\nor other, one of whom stopped him to call out: \"Do not forget that you\nare going with us to see Siddons in _Macbeth_ on Friday night.\"\n\n\"Are you, Cousin Robert? How I envy you!\" said Georgiana, as they passed\non. \"We have tickets to see her next week in _King John_; but I hear\nLady Macbeth is her finest part.\"\n\n\"I am ashamed to say that I have never witnessed any of her performances\nas yet,\" replied Fitzwilliam; \"I hardly know how I have missed them, but\nit behooves me to make up for lost time. I shall come round on Saturday\nmorning and harrow your feelings with a description of the play.\"\n\n\"Do, please, and then I can write to Elizabeth about it. How much I\nshall have to tell her this week; about my coming to this beautiful\nplace and meeting Miss Crawford.\"\n\nGeorgiana thought her cousin looked happier when they were driving home\nthan she had yet seen him look in London, and they discussed the details\nof a plan to go to Hampton Court and dine there, which seemed to contain\nall the elements of perfect bliss. Fitzwilliam was indeed experiencing\ngreater peace of mind than he had done since he parted from Mary in\nBath, though for what reason he could scarcely explain to himself. Her\nmanner had been merely that of courtesy, and had not contained a hint of\nthe old friendliness; and Sir Walter Elliot had been, as ever, at her\nelbow. Yet Fitzwilliam felt that each interview he could obtain opened\nthe way towards her a little more, and he had resolved to press straight\nonward, letting no such obstacles arise as he had formed an effectual\nbarrier between them in Bath, but, rather, making use of every incident\nthat occurred, such as Georgiana's accidental presence and the ensuing\nintroduction, to bring himself nearer to her.\n\nHe was keeping this object ever in view when he joined his friends at\nthe theatre a few evenings later, and in glancing round the house after\nthe first act, observed Miss Crawford with several other persons in a\nbox at some distance from him. He immediately began to consider the\npossibility of going up to speak to her, although unacquainted with the\nhostess, for Mrs. Grant was not there, and he conjectured that the party\nwere in the charge of Sir Walter and Miss Elliot, by the manner in which\nthat lady and gentleman rose to welcome a visitor who had just entered\nthe box. Fitzwilliam determined to obtain an introduction through some\nfriend, and for this purpose to go up to the box during the third\ninterval, which was the longest of the evening.\n\nThe second interval, however, was destined to produce something of a\ndisconcerting nature. Fitzwilliam was conversing with the wife of his\nfriend, General Stuart, whose guest he was, and learning from her the\nnames and other particulars of many of the persons present, for she had\nlong lived in London and had a wide acquaintance. She was reckoned to be\na lively companion, though the information she gave, and her manner of\nimparting it were, the one so positive and the other so vigorous, that\nher hearers were tempted frequently to forget, until after they had\nassimilated it, that she might have spoken without the best authority.\nShe had chanced to notice the people in the Elliots' box, and she drew\nColonel Fitzwilliam's rather unwilling attention to them. He did not\nwish to discuss, or hear discussed, the Crawfords or their friends, and\nimplied at once that several of them were known to him. Mrs. Stuart was\nall interest, and inquired if it was that charming Miss Crawford that he\nknew, and, if so, whether he could explain why it was that she was going\nto marry that insufferable old coxcomb, Sir Walter Elliot. Colonel\nFitzwilliam replied, concealing his apprehension as best he could, that\nhe did not know that she was; he had never heard it.\n\n\"Then you are the only one in the population of London who has not heard\nit, my dear Colonel. Why, where have you been, to be out of the way of\nsuch a piece of news? At least fifty people have told me, and of course\nall of them have it straight from the most reliable source. It is hard\nto believe that such a beautiful creature should throw herself away like\nthat on a foolish, impecunious old fellow who is old enough to be her\nfather, and has nothing in the world but his title and his tailor to\nrecommend him. I cannot comprehend why girls do these things; one can\nonly suppose that she is tired of the single life and wants a suitable\nsettlement.\"\n\n\"I am almost sure there must be some mistake, Mrs. Stuart,\" interposed\nColonel Fitzwilliam. \"I saw Miss Crawford the only lately, and\nshe--there was nothing said about her engagement.\" He stopped, feeling\nhow very lame such a refutation was, unsupported by any testimony.\n\n\"Nonsense, my dear sir. You have been living in your books, or you would\nhave heard of it. Do you see that short, stout young man over there? He\nis a Mr. John Thorpe, and he was speaking of it at our house the other\nevening, and asserted positively that he had heard it mentioned in Bath\nmonths ago.\"\n\n\"I am quite certain that Miss Crawford was not engaged when she was in\nBath,\" was all Colonel Fitzwilliam would permit himself to say.\n\n\"Well, you are very uncivil, I must say; you had better obtain someone\nelse's assurance if you will not accept mine. Though anyone can see how\nit has come about; naturally the Elliots have pushed it forward to the\nutmost of their power. Sir Walter wants a pretty wife, and as he cannot\nsupport one out of that vanished fortune of his, he must choose one who\nhas enough for both. And Miss Elliot would like to establish a\nconnection between the families for the sake of a certain Mr. Henry\nCrawford, who is still unmarried--he is a rake, of course, but she does\nnot mind that. You know which he is?--the dark young man standing up at\nthe back of the box.\"\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam was so excessively disturbed and irritated by this\nconversation, which he had endeavoured to check by saying: \"You must be\nquite satisfied now, Mrs. Stuart, with the answers you have provided to\nyour own question,\" that the rising of the curtain was a great relief;\nhe could sit silent, inattentive to the play, wrapped in his own anxious\nthoughts. Mrs. Stuart's was certainly not the last word on this terribly\nimportant matter, for he felt he must hear the facts from some other\nquarter before he could credit them. The fine scene of Banquo's murder\nwas played, as far as he was concerned, to deaf ears, and his eyes\ncontinually sought the box above, where he could just see Mary's white\ncloak, and Sir Walter's fashionable attire always, it seemed, in\nproximity to it. The instant the curtain fell again he rose from his\nseat and made the best of his way towards the exit, but so many\ngentlemen were leaving their seats at the same time that he found\nhimself in a crowd where it was impossible to progress at any great rate\nof speed. At this moment he heard his name pronounced behind him, and\nlooking round, he recognized two friends, former brother officers of his\nown, who had remained seated near the end of one of the rows.\n\nImpatient of the delay, he nevertheless went to them and remained a few\nminutes in talk, finding that one of his friends, Captain Ross, was\nlame and had difficulty moving along the narrow gangways. They were\npresently joined by a Mr. Palmer, whom Fitzwilliam knew as a man of few\nwords, reserved, and of almost unamiable temper, but thoroughly\ntrustworthy, and too little interested in his neighbours' affairs to be\npossessed of any superfluous knowledge concerning them.\n\nFitzwilliam had a slight acquaintance with him, and after a little\nconsideration he asked him, as if casually: \"Do you know anything of Sir\nWalter Elliot, Palmer?\"\n\n\"As much as I want to,\" was the reply. \"A stupid fellow. If he were\nframed and glazed he would be a good deal more useful than he now is, I\nconsider.\"\n\nCaptain Ross laughingly agreed with him, claiming some knowledge of Sir\nWalter Elliot himself, and calling on his hearers to witness the\ninequality of human justice, when such a man as that could find a young\nand charming wife.\n\n\"Is it true then,\" asked Fitzwilliam, summoning all his fortitude, \"that\nSir Walter Elliot is going to be married?\"\n\n\"Perfectly true,\" rejoined Captain Ross and his companion, \"and you know\nto whom--that lady in the box with him now.\"\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam had no need to look; it was enough to know that the\nworst he dreaded was about to befall. His friends seemed to notice\nnothing in his agitated manner of asking \"Are you sure?\" in such haste\nwere they to pour out their information.\n\n\"Yes, it has been talked of for a long time, but is quite settled now. I\nwas in the club last night when Elliot was having supper there, and he\ntold us all to drink to his health to-day, for he would be the happiest\nman in the world. So that party up there is doubtless celebrating the\nbetrothal.\"\n\n\"Besides, do you not recollect,\" added Captain Ross, \"that when I met\nMiss Elliot the other night she told me her father would probably have\nsome legal business to arrange, when Mr. Crawford returned from Paris,\nand then, she hoped, would come the announcement of a happy event?\nCrawford is there now, you see.\"\n\n\"The legal business in this case may include a settlement to be made on\nElliot himself,\" laughed the other officer. \"Can you understand people\nadvertising their affairs so freely beforehand? He must have had reason\nto feel pretty confident. Well, I shall always think it a great shame.\nMiss Crawford is much too good for him, but it is not the first time she\nhas played with a man in this way, and now, I suppose she finds herself\ntoo much involved to draw back, or Elliot has been sharp enough to make\nsure of her, unlike that dilatory young Bertram.\"\n\n\"Why, yes, besides being presumably a better bargain than a mere country\nparson,\" added Captain Ross. \"I imagine they will live at Kellynch. When\nI last saw Wentworth he told me his sister, the tenant, was just\nleaving.\"\n\nFitzwilliam felt as if he could not bear more of this, but, making a\ngreat effort, he turned once more to Mr. Palmer and asked if he thought\nthe rumour to be true. Mr. Palmer looked at him in some surprise.\n\n\"Yes, certainly, why not? There is not the slightest reason to doubt it.\nWe have the evidence of our eyes and the word of one of the principal\nparties. My wife and her mother are going to call to-morrow and offer\ntheir congratulations.\"\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam hardly knew how he got away, what his three friends\nthought of him, or what General Stuart, whom he had met outside the\nlobby, could comprehend of his excuses for his abrupt departure. He only\nknew that he could not return to his place, watching the woman who\npossessed his whole heart in the company of the lover to whom she had\npromised herself. He must be alone, in the darkness and silence, to\nbrace himself to endure the shock of what he had heard and realize all\nthat would follow from it. He hastened through the streets, and shut\nhimself up in his rooms, conscious only that this was a defeat, not a\nmere repulse such as he had received at Bath, but a defeat the\ncompleteness and finality of which admitted no rally on the losing side.\nLong he paced his room, struggling to fight down the anguish of his mind\nand to see clearly through his utter wretchedness what had happened and\nhow. Even in the midst of his sufferings it was not difficult for him to\npiece together all the items of his knowledge into a connected whole.\nShe had wearied of him at Bath; that must have been the beginning of it;\nhe had not been able to gain her affection in a sufficient degree for it\nto be proof against Lady Catherine's attack. That catastrophe had swept\nhim, equally with his cousins, away from whatever place he had held in\nMary Crawford's esteem; and when he met her again in London, and could\nresume his efforts to recover that place, it was already occupied.\n\nWas that, then, why she had seemed not to wish to be too\nfriendly--because it was too late? He was forced to believe it; he could\nindeed easily believe anything that was a proof against her\nconsideration, her goodness of heart, that had endeavoured to save him\npain. He could and did believe that he had failed to win her, but that\nshe could have accepted Sir Walter Elliot left him for many hours\nstunned and incredulous. That she, with her many gifts of mind and body,\nher true elegance, her sensibility, her refinement of breeding, placing\nher in almost a different world from the vulgar pretentiousness of Sir\nWalter and his daughter, which in Bath had so often seemed uncongenial\nto her, should now actually find such a man all-sufficient, and should\nconsent to join her life with his, was an outrage, a madness--all the\nmore so if she had drifted into it in the way the onlookers imagined.\nShe could not know what she was doing. Her friends--what were they\nabout? She must be warned. Fitzwilliam impulsively strode to the door,\nthen stopped and flung himself down with a bitter laugh at his own\nfolly--he to be raging through all the commonplace jealousies of a\nrejected lover, like any boy of nineteen! What could he or anyone else\ndo? Miss Crawford was perfectly free to choose; she had a brother, with\nwhose knowledge she was probably acting, and there was nothing to be\nalleged against Sir Walter Elliot's character. Recollecting the comments\nhe had heard that evening, Fitzwilliam was forced to the same\nconclusions; to acknowledging that Miss Elliot, Mary's own friend, had\nin all probability promoted the match; that Henry Crawford, weak and\nunstable where women's persuasions were concerned, had allowed himself\nto be drawn into the Elliot net, and that his sister, though she could\nhave little real regard for Sir Walter, wished to settle down and, her\nfortune making her independent of means in her future husband, had\nchosen where her fancy and a title attracted her.\n\nHow mean, how sordid was the whole story! Not the least heartrending of\nColonel Fitzwilliam's reflections that night was that it could not be\nhis Mary, the true Mary who had shown herself to him for a short time,\nwho was now taking this step, so unworthy of her best self. For the\nwoman he knew her to be, what happiness could be in store?\n\n\n\n\nChapter XI\n\n\nGeorgiana was alone in the drawing-room of Mrs. Annesley's house on the\nfollowing morning, practising the pianoforte, when the expected rap at\nthe front door was heard, and Colonel Fitzwilliam was presently ushered\ninto the room. She sprang up to welcome him, prepared for a cheerful\ngreeting, but was unspeakably concerned at the sight of his haggard face\nand worn, exhausted looks, the more so because he made no attempt to\naccount for them, but forced a smile, accepted the chair which she\noffered him, and endeavoured to speak as usual. Georgiana begged him to\npartake of some refreshment, and expressed a fear that he was ill, not\ndaring to give utterance to her real conjecture.\n\n\"No, no, Georgiana, thank you. I will not have anything; I assure you I\nam not ill. I have only come to wish you good-bye, as I have changed my\nplans; I--I am thinking of going to Ireland.\"\n\n\"To Ireland!\" repeated Georgiana in consternation.\n\n\"Yes, I have a friend who owns an estate there, and he has often invited\nme to come over and fish and shoot with him, so I shall start to-night,\nand take him by surprise, arriving early next week.\"\n\n\"But--to Ireland!\" Georgiana could only repeat, so utterly bewildered\nwas she. \"Dear Cousin Robert, I am so sorry; I wish you need not ...\nwould you not go to Pemberley? Elizabeth and Darcy would so gladly\nreceive you, or do anything--\"\n\n\"I know they would; there is nothing that goodness and kindness suggest\nthat would not occur to them, but I do not think I could go there just\nat present. Will you give them my love, Georgiana, when you are next\nwriting, and tell them of my movements? I will write to them from\nIreland and give them my direction.\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed, I will, but may I not tell them anything more? Oh, how\nI wish I could help you in any way,\" exclaimed Georgiana, anxiety\nshowing itself so acutely in every syllable that Fitzwilliam was forced\nto get up to avert his face from hers, lest his self-command should be\ntoo sorely tried.\n\n\"My dear, kind little cousin, I shall always be grateful to you, even\nthough I fear it is not in your power to help me just now. Some day,\nperhaps, we may speak of it; in the meantime--I have had a great\ndisappointment, and I think I had better go away for awhile, so as to be\nmore fit to meet my friends when I return.\" He came back to her, raised\nher up, and spoke with resolution and cheerfulness. \"Come, Georgiana, do\nnot be sad, it is not worth while. I shall probably be at Pemberley in\nthe autumn, and we must do something then to make up for the loss of our\nexploration party now. Do not think of me--at least, only think of me as\ncatching and eating a great many salmon. I hope you will have great deal\nof pleasure still in London. You return to the Hursts to-day, do you\nnot? Will you make my excuses to Mrs. Annesley?\"\n\nDuring this speech Georgiana had striven to recover her composure, and\nshe managed at the conclusion of it to look up at him with a tolerably\ncalm face and to promise to deliver his messages. She felt convinced\nthat he had been refused by Miss Crawford, and the situation was to her\nso dreadful, so far beyond repair, that it was a relief to see her\ncousin's courage, and to know that he did not wish to hear vain and\nspiritless words of consolation, words which she hardly could have been\nable to utter, even had he been able to listen, from the very surcharge\nof tender feeling that burdened her heart. Nevertheless, her sympathy\nwas reflected in her eyes, and in the gentle voice with which she bid\nhim adieu and wished him well. Fitzwilliam was not insensible to it. It\ngave him the only comfort he could have received at such a time; and\npressing her hand warmly, with a very earnest \"God bless you!\" he\nquitted the room.\n\nAs his footsteps died away Georgiana sank into a chair and wept\nbitterly. So brief had been his visit--a few ticks of the clock had seen\nhis arrival and his departure; and in those few moments the aspect of\neverything had changed. Since their last meeting Georgiana had dwelt\nincessantly upon his prospects of happiness, and allowed herself to\nthink of them as being in a fair way to become realized. The difficulty\nwhich Elizabeth must have referred to, and Mr. Yates had actually hinted\nat, could surely be cleared away now that he and Miss Crawford had met\nagain; and Georgiana had not been able to read cruelty or harshness in\nthat fair face. Time only--a very short time--would be necessary, and\nonce Miss Crawford knew Fitzwilliam as he was, the rest would follow as\na matter of course: for how could any woman whom he really loved be able\nto resist him? So reasoned Georgiana, and the collapse of her kindly\nhopes brought back all her old sense of personal guilt; she, too, was\npartly responsible for her cousin's dire fate, for was she not one of\nthe two women who had failed to make him happy? She who had not been\nable to inspire him with a real love, and Miss Crawford who could not\nrespond to it now it was fully awakened.\n\nThe luxury of grief could not be long indulged in, for tear-stained\nfeatures must not be shown to her friends, nor was there leisure that\nday to pour out her heart in a letter to Elizabeth. Georgiana had to\nkeep her sorrowful thoughts to herself, and fortunately it was not\nnecessary to give any explanation of Colonel Fitzwilliam's abrupt\ndeparture from town to Mrs. Annesley; the simple statement that he had\ngone, leaving apologies and suitable compliments, was sufficient. With\nher hostesses in Grosvenor Street, however, it was a different matter,\nand Georgiana lacked courage to introduce the subject until a morning or\ntwo later, at breakfast, choosing the moment when the letters had just\nbeen brought in and everyone had only that remnant of attention to spare\nwhich their meal and their correspondence had not absorbed. Mr. Hurst\nasked a question or two, which, as his wife and sister were speaking at\nthe same time, went so long unanswered that he quite forgot them; Louisa\nshowed surprise and offended dignity that the Colonel had not paid a\nfarewell call on her before leaving; while Caroline, with less pride and\na great deal of curiosity, attempted at first to draw Georgiana into\nsome admission beyond the mere mention of the fact, but remembering by\nhappy chance to have heard the name of the friend in Ireland, and even\nthat of his estate, she was able to her own satisfaction to convert the\nmysterious journey into an engagement of respectably long standing.\nGeorgiana breathed more freely; she had dreaded Miss Bingley's\ncross-examination, and still so dreaded anyone guessing at her cousin's\nmisfortune that she even deviated so far from her usual truthfulness as\nto say, \"Yes, probably he had been intending to go all the time, as soon\nas the weather should be suitable.\"\n\nIt was the greatest comfort to feel that with Elizabeth there need be no\nconcealment. Already a description of the meeting with Miss Crawford had\ntravelled to Pemberley, but with none but the simplest and most obvious\ncomment; Georgiana asked, as directed by Fitzwilliam, for more\nparticulars connected with her new acquaintance, but until she had been\nopenly admitted to a share in her elders' knowledge she did not like to\nspeak of what was still mere guesswork. But now, although Elizabeth's\nanswer had not yet been received, she felt she could write more freely;\nshe only had been allowed a glimpse of her cousin's inmost heart, she\nonly had witnessed his grief and had been allowed to surmise its origin;\nshe could be the indirect means of bringing him the quick sympathy of\nhis two best friends, and she was justified in telling her sister of all\nshe knew and all she conjectured. \"He had been refused, dear Elizabeth,\"\nran one sentence, \"it can be nothing else, and I fear it is irrevocable.\nPoor Cousin Robert! He feels it so terribly. Can nothing be done for\nhim? You know her, you know them both, he is sure to tell you all. Do\nhelp him, dear Elizabeth; you always help people who are in trouble.\"\n\nHer letter closed and dispatched, she experienced a feeling of relief\nfrom strain, having left her cousin's affairs in more capable hands than\nher own. His sad face long haunted her, but the words she had written\nreminded her of another person who was now probably calling upon\nElizabeth for sympathy and help. Not that Kitty had been by any means\nforgotten, but in the silence that followed on her departure, and the\nnew interest that had occupied the last few days, the ball and its\nattendant emotions had been rather pushed to one side. But Georgiana had\nreturned to Grosvenor Street fully expecting to find a letter from\nDerbyshire, or intelligence of Kitty in some other form.\n\nHer own letter to Elizabeth, concluded the morning after the ball, had\ncontained, in addition to an account of that memorable event, a\nparagraph to this effect: \"Kitty has something extremely interesting to\ntell you. I shall not spoil her pleasure by anticipating her, but only\nadd that I believe everything is going to turn out just as happily as\nshe would like and as we should like for her. Pray, pray, give me your\nopinion on this important matter as soon as you can form one. I am\nlonging to have it.\" A reply to this letter was indeed awaiting her, but\ndid not give the desired information, as Elizabeth, though anxious to\nhear Kitty's news, had not yet had an opportunity of seeing her, and\nKitty herself had not written. She was a wretched correspondent, and the\ndelights of the first few days with Jane and the children doubtless\nabsorbed both head and hands. Bingley's own notes to his sisters during\nthat week were useless. One announced his and Kitty's safe arrival,\nanother requested the forwarding of some stockings he had left behind;\nwas it likely that such communications would have any bearing upon an\nimportant matter like the progress of a young lady's love affair? As to\nMr. Price, Georgiana knew nothing, and was prepared for anything; it was\nquite possible that he had been unable to wait for the shooting of Mr.\nBingley's pheasants and was at that moment in Derbyshire.\n\nUpon this point, however, elucidation was presently forthcoming. At the\ndinner-table that afternoon Miss Bingley suddenly inquired: \"Did I tell\nyou, Georgiana, that we had a call from Charles's friend, Mr. Price, one\nday last week?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Georgiana, startled by such an abrupt incursion into the\nsubject. \"I had not heard. Were you at home? Did you see him?\"\n\n\"Yes, we were all at home. He is an agreeable young fellow; manners a\nlittle too self-possessed, perhaps, for his age, but they are what these\nnaval men acquire. He asked after you, rather as if he expected to find\nyou here.\"\n\nGeorgiana said to herself that he wanted the latest news of Kitty, or,\nat all events, any he could not obtain from Mrs. Knightley, and was glad\nto be saved the necessity of replying aloud by Mrs. Hurst's beginning to\nspeak. Yes, they had quite liked him; she thought of inviting him to\nfill a vacant place at a dinner she was giving the following week, for\nthese young men who had travelled could always talk entertainingly\nenough to be worth while; but she would like to be assured of his\ncharacter; she fancied he had been a good deal run after and spoilt, and\ncertainly he was a great flirt.\n\nGeorgiana's heart swelled, and her pulse beat quick at such an\naccusation, while she uttered a mild but steady protest against it. Mrs.\nHurst maintained her ground, but her young guest was supported by Miss\nBingley, who said: \"Nonsense, Louisa, you know I have told you there is\nreally nothing in that. All these young officers, especially those who\nhave seen service, are bound to be run after, whether they will or not.\nAnd as to his being a great flirt, we have seen him once or twice going\nabout with a very good-looking woman, and that is all the reason we have\nfor thinking so.\"\n\n\"How can you say such a thing, Caroline? Mr. Price is perfectly at\nliberty to go about with as many handsome women as he likes, even if\ntheir brothers are notoriously vicious, but if he is engaged to one of\nthem--and from all we heard and saw at Emma Knightley's the other night\nhe certainly ought to be--one has a right to expect a little more\ndiscretion.\"\n\n\"It is not at all certain that he is engaged to Kitty Bennet, I\nbelieve,\" said Caroline; \"you know Emma Knightley's great schemes do not\nalways come to anything.\" Georgiana was thereupon appealed to by both\nsisters to give a denial or confirmation of the fact alleged, and she\ncould only say that she believed that at present he and Kitty were not\nengaged.\n\n\"That rather supports my opinion of him,\" said Mrs. Hurst. \"But I shall\nbe glad to be proved wrong. Georgiana, if you are behind the scenes, you\nmust let us know as soon as there is anything to be told.\"\n\n\"And in the meantime, unless you think Mr. Price likely to injure our\nmorals, you had better invite him to dinner,\" added her sister.\n\nGeorgiana felt unaccountably disturbed by this conversation. She could\nnot bear hearing a person ill spoken of whom she had every wish and\nreason to like and esteem, and though she felt sure her own impressions\nof Mr. Price, which differed so widely from Mrs. Hurst's, were far more\nlikely to be the correct ones, her timidity in trusting her own\njudgments caused her to pause and wonder whether she had been too hasty\nin being so impulsively delighted with him; ought she not, as Kitty's\nfriend, to be more cautious until she had been sure that he was not\ngoing to disappoint the hopes of that friend? That he _had_ raised high\nhopes, Georgiana knew, but even supposing Kitty's imagination had been\nher strong ally, his attentions, and Kitty's willing acceptance of them,\nhad clearly been such as to expose her to remark. Georgiana sighed over\nthe difficulties of the whole problem. She could not bring herself to\nbelieve that William Price was a flirt, though the picture of him in\nconstant attendance upon a handsome woman who had doubtful relations,\nwhen he should have thought only of Kitty, was an unwelcome one. No one\nwith that countenance, that frank smile and clear honest eye could\nsurely be other than he seemed, and yet--Georgiana had not to look far\ninto the past to find a disappointment, as unexpected, as severe, as Mr.\nPrice's defection could be. The persons who were apparently most\nattractive could often fail one most disastrously. With Miss Crawford's\nimage on one side of her, and William Price's on the other, Georgiana\nfelt that anything was possible, but she resolved to keep an open mind;\nshe recollected that Kitty and Mrs. Knightley must know him more\nintimately than Mrs. Hurst did, and in trying to obliterate the latter's\nwords from her mind she fell into a reverie, wherein she lived again\nthrough every joyous moment of Mrs. Knightley's ball.\n\nDuring the ensuing week the long-wished-for letters arrived, but, as is\nusual in such cases, they fell far short of expectation. Which of us has\nnot looked forward, some time or another, to receiving a letter which we\nare convinced will have an important effect upon our minds? It will\nclear up a mystery, give specific information, console us in affliction,\nor furnish the exact counsels which we need; we depend upon it for one\nor all of these things, and we continue to do so, even though the letter\nwhich arrives after so much anticipation is almost always inadequate. It\ntells us half instead of all we expected our correspondent to know, its\nadvice has overlooked our difficulties and does not meet the case, its\nwords of comfort are few and arid. Yet hope leads us ever on, and the\nenvelope bearing our friend's handwriting is torn open with as much\neagerness at the fiftieth crisis as at the first. Georgiana put down\nElizabeth's letter with a feeling of disappointment, yet telling herself\nthat she could not have expected anything else. Elizabeth wrote that\nvarious matters had prevented her from seeing Kitty up to that time,\nbut that she had heard from Jane all particulars of Kitty's\nacquaintanceship with Mr. Price, with additional interest from having\nheard his name already from the Wentworths, and was inclined to\nentertain the most favourable hopes regarding it; it was difficult to\nsay more without seeing the young people together, and they could only\nlook forward to the visit in November, and trust to it to bring about\nthe happiest results. This was the ordinary, sensible view, and\nGeorgiana took up Kitty's letter wondering whether she was now calm\nenough in mind to be induced to take the same.\n\n\"Desborough Park,\n\n\"July.\n\n\"My Dear Georgiana,\n\n\"I make no apology for not writing, for you know what it is like here\nthe first few days, so much to see, and Jane wanting me all the time,\nbesides, you have all the news, now that I have left London there is\nnothing for me to relate. I received your letter from Mrs. Annesley's,\nbut pray write again as soon as you possibly can and tell me if you have\nseen anything of Mr. P----. I was so enchanted to hear Miss Bingley ask\nhim to call, as it meant I should hear of him from you. He stayed on\nquite a long time at the ball, and Mrs. Knightley told me he thanked her\nin such a _particular_ and _unmistakable_ way when he said good-night! I\nforgot to ask you, do you not think he dances exquisitely? I have never\nworn that rose-coloured gown since. How I long for November! What shall\nI do if he is prevented? I cannot describe how thankful I am that I did\nnot go with Lydia to the West Indies. I have seen Mr. Morland, whom you\ntold me of, a great many times; indeed, he spends half his time here, as\nJane and Bingley are very fond of him. He is very pleasant, considering\nhe is a clergyman. He is laying out his garden at the Rectory afresh,\nand Jane is giving him a quantity of plants, so we go down there\nfrequently to help him to put them in. Now I must conclude, as Mr.\nMorland is coming to take me out in a boat on the lake. It will be very\namusing, as I have never been able to get near enough to the\nwater-lilies to gather them, but as I say to Mr. Morland, we can neither\nof us swim, and what will happen then? Jane sends you many messages.\n\n\"Your affectionate friend.\"\n\nA postscript on another page added: \"Mrs. K. says that Mr. P. is likely\nto be made commander very soon. I hope he will not be, for he would have\nto join the ship immediately, but would not _Captain Price_ sound well?\"\n\n_Captain Price_ sounded very well; even Georgiana could not help\nthinking so, as she smiled over Kitty's artless question, which resented\nthe promotion while it welcomed the title. This letter, too, was just\nwhat might have been expected; Kitty was nursing her attachment in the\ncountry just as she had nursed it in town, and Georgiana was called upon\nto supply it with nourishment. She would have to wait until after she\nhad seen Mr. Price to know whether any was forthcoming.\n\nMrs. Hurst's dinner-party took place, and closely resembled every other\nfunction of the same kind in fashionable houses, being very long, very\ncorrect and very sumptuous. Georgiana wished that Louisa would place her\nnext to Mr. Price, but this was not done, and accordingly, though he\nwalked straight towards her after having spoken to his host and\nhostesses, he had scarcely inquired after her health before he was drawn\naway to be introduced to his dinner partner, while Georgiana was\naccosted by hers, a certain Captain Wentworth whom, with his wife, she\nhad met in Bath the year before. The Wentworths went there regularly,\nand the friendship which existed between them and the Darcy family had\nbeen renewed there in the previous April. On one occasion, when they had\nall happened to be in town together, Elizabeth had introduced the\nWentworths to Mrs. Hurst, and the result had been a liking on the part\nof that lady stronger than with her cold and narrow disposition she was\nusually inclined to form. The liking was not, perhaps, quite so heartily\nreturned, but Captain Wentworth was sociable and enjoyed mixing with the\nworld, and Anne's tender solicitude for him caused her to accept\nwillingly any invitations likely to procure him amusement, both at\nWinchester, where they lived, and in the course of their frequent visits\nto town.\n\nCaptain Wentworth well remembered Mr. and Mrs. Darcy's shy, handsome\nsister, and prepared for a pleasant evening when he found in her less of\nthe former quality, and even more than she had used to possess of the\nlatter. On her other side was seated the alarming Mr. Knightley, and\nGeorgiana was glad to find she had at all events one companion so\nconversable as Captain Wentworth, who belonged to the profession she was\nmost interested in, even though he was not the representative of it\nwhich she would have chosen.\n\nTheir talk was lively, for Captain Wentworth had the art of treating\nsubjects amusingly, and of drawing from his companion professions of\nopinion which she had not till then known herself to hold. Somehow or\nother they had drifted on to the topic of inconsistency in sailors, and\nCaptain Wentworth gravely undertook their defence against this charge.\n\n\"I assure you, Miss Darcy, it is a great mistake, made only because\npeople are unacquainted with our true character. It is of long standing,\nbut a fallacy just as much as many other accepted fallacies--for\ninstance, that parrots always talk bad language, that ladies cannot\nkeep accounts, that the King can do no wrong, etc.\"\n\n\"Oh, stop, please, Captain Wentworth,\" interposed Georgiana. \"You are\nopening up too many vexed questions. I was going to say,\" she added more\nseriously, \"that no doubt you are quite right, but I should think if\nthey are inconstant it would not be so very strange, for they must have\nso many temptations.\"\n\n\"Not at all; I protest they have no more excuse on that head than any\nother class of man. If a man is inconstant by nature, he will be so,\nwhether he is a sailor or a butcher's assistant. I speak from\nexperience, for I know I tried very hard to be inconstant, and could not\nsucceed, though I had as many temptations as mist.\"\n\n\"Knowing Mrs. Wentworth,\" said Georgiana, with a smile at that lady, \"I\ncannot help being aware of how strong a temptation you had to be the\nreverse.\"\n\n\"Exactly; and so would it be with anyone who had once given whatever\naffection he had to bestow. How have you got the idea, Miss Darcy, that\nwe poor men of the sea are so fickle?\"\n\n\"Indeed, no, I have not got it,\" replied Georgiana, trying to speak\nlightly. \"I was merely speculating, for I know too little about it to\nform any judgments. It was put into my mind through hearing someone say\nthat young officers were so much sought after everywhere; and I thought,\nif that were so, it was only natural that the amiable ones might find,\neventually, that they had formed many more friendships than they could\npossibly keep up.\"\n\n\"Very considerately put, Miss Darcy; but, in effect, what you mean is\nthat they continually 'love and ride away.' Sailors may have more\nopportunity for that kind of living, but, upon my word, I do not believe\nthey have more inclination. But granting that it is so, I gather that\nyou are prepared to forgive them this little weakness?\"\n\n\"That is asking rather too much, Captain Wentworth,\" replied Georgiana,\nin the same spirit of gaiety. Had she spoken the whole truth, she would\nhave said: \"Certainly not, if any friend of mine were involved,\" but not\nwishing her companion to think that their chat had any personal\napplication, she continued: \"I shall be able to tell better when I have\nmet with such a case,\" and turned the subject off with a smile.\n\nSoon after the ladies returned to the drawing-room Georgiana seated\nherself beside Mrs. Wentworth, whose gentle manners, combined with\nserenity of temper and the power she had of entering, unobtrusively, but\nnone the less sincerely, into the feelings of others, had for Georgiana\na strong attraction. They had not met for so long that there was much to\nbe talked over between them. Mrs. Wentworth presently asked after\nColonel Fitzwilliam, and explained that she happened to know he was in\ntown through seeing him a few nights previously at the theatre, where\nshe had been with a party invited by her father and sister. Georgiana\nreplied that he was well, but had gone away since then; and so as not to\ndwell on the subject, asked for a description of the play, which led\nthem on to other topics of interest, when they were interrupted by Mrs.\nKnightley's joining them. Her errand was merely to ask for news of\nKitty, and Georgiana, rather than resenting the smile of mutual\nunderstanding with which the question was put, answered as briefly as\nshe could without discourtesy.\n\nMrs. Knightley then began talking of other things, and resettled herself\nin her chair, so that Georgiana despaired of having Mrs. Wentworth to\nherself any more that evening; but perceiving she was not wanted\nelsewhere, she continued to retain her place until the gentlemen entered\nthe room, simultaneously with the tea and coffee, which the servants\nbegan to dispense. Mr. Price obtained cups immediately, and brought them\nacross the room to the group of ladies, at once warmly greeting Mrs.\nWentworth. Mrs. Knightley remained beside them, and Georgiana indulged\nin a little private regret, partly on her own account and partly on his,\nfor she knew he must be wanting to talk to her about Kitty, and since\nthere was music during the evening, the present might be the only\nopportunity they would have. She began to think of moving away, for Mr.\nPrice seemed quite monopolized by Mrs. Knightley, who was endeavouring\nto show him off by asking him questions and calling Mrs. Wentworth's\nattention to the answers; and though Georgiana was grateful to his\nefforts to draw her in, by an occasional smiling glance at her and a\n\"Don't you think so, Miss Darcy?\" there did not seem to be any place for\na fourth in their conversation.\n\nPresently, however, an interruption arrived in the person of Captain\nWentworth, who came, with coffee-cup in hand, to join their group, and\nas Mr. Price stood aside to give him room, he exclaimed cheerfully:\n\"Well, Price, have you and my wife undertaken the conversion of Miss\nDarcy yet? Here has someone been deluding her with most horrible picture\nof us sailors--'one foot on sea, and one on shore, to one thing constant\nnever'--you know the rest of it. I have been trying to persuade her that\nit is all wrong.\"\n\nGeorgiana, blushing and smiling, began to protest, and Mrs. Wentworth,\nto spare her, also treated it as a joke, but Mrs. Knightley, when she\nhad comprehended Captain Wentworth's meaning, gave her a look of no\ngreat goodwill, and said: \"Surely Miss Darcy does not take seriously\nwhat is merely a vulgar tradition. 'Men were deceivers ever' was not\nwritten with special reference to sailors, I imagine, but to men in\ngeneral.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Captain Wentworth, with mock gravity; \"but Miss\nDarcy does not base her suspicions on those lines only, but on far more\nserious premises.\"\n\n\"Frederick, I will not have you tease Miss Darcy so unmercifully,\" said\nMrs. Wentworth. \"It is really too bad. I am sure you have placed words\nin her mouth which she never uttered, has he not, Miss Darcy?\"\n\nGeorgiana, struggling with embarrassment, amusement and not a little\nreal vexation, as she was conscious of Mr. Price's eyes being turned\nsilently upon her, could not protest as intelligibly as she would have\nwished. \"Yes, Mrs. Wentworth, it is quite untrue--I never said anything\nof the kind. Captain Wentworth, you are unfair--not that it really\nmatters--but I said I had no opinion on the subject--I only thought I\ncould quite understand their being changeable, if they were.\"\n\nWhether her hearers could extract any meaning from these words, she did\nnot know, but it was certain that her confusion stood her in good stead,\nfor Captain Wentworth immediately apologized with just as much\nseriousness as was needful. \"I am very sorry, Miss Darcy; pray excuse my\nstupidity. I was so distressed to feel that we, as a class, should merit\nyour disapproval in even one particular, that I wanted to clear our\ncharacters--and, after all, you are so kind as to imply that they needed\nno clearing.\"\n\n\"I do not think Miss Darcy implied that,\" said Mrs. Knightley, \"and I\nconfess myself curious to learn why she thinks naval men are likely to\nbe changeable; it would be interesting to compare notes, for my\nexperience of them has led me to the opposite conclusion.\"\n\nGeorgiana felt the double edge in Mrs. Knightley's words, and it was\npainful to her to be so completely misunderstood, even in such a\ntrifling matter; but she had hardly recovered her composure enough to\ndefend herself when Captain Wentworth took the matter out of her hands.\n\n\"Miss Darcy's experience of inconstancy in sailors has been a sad one,\nMrs. Knightley,\" he said solemnly. \"It is drawn entirely from books and\nplays, and we know how persistently they look on the dark side of human\nnature. She only needs to become acquainted better with real life, as\npersonified in myself, Mr. Price\" (with a bow to William) \"and many\nother admirable specimens of naval men, to form the soundest of opinions\nof us. Pardon me, Miss Darcy, for assuming the role of spokesman, but I\nfancied the fear of offending my modesty might have prevented you from\nexpressing such sentiments as you would wish.\"\n\n\"I hope you will always interpret me as correctly as you have done,\nCaptain Wentworth,\" returned Georgiana, smiling; and seeing that Mrs.\nKnightley was beginning to speak in a low tone to Mr. Price, and not\nwishing to hear any of her comments, she turned to Mrs. Wentworth and\nproposed that they should move to chairs nearer the pianoforte. They\ntherefore turned in that direction, but Mr. Price could hardly have any\ntime to reply to Mrs. Knightley, for an instant later he was at\nGeorgiana's side, asking if he might find her a seat; and Mrs. Wentworth\nbeing just then drawn away by Miss Bingley, she not unwillingly allowed\nhim to lead her to a sofa on the opposite side of the room, to procure\nher another cup of coffee, her own having been removed, and to sit\nbeside her, talking quietly and agreeably in a manner that soothed her\nnerves, irritated as they were by Captain Wentworth's ill-timed\nraillery. She listened absently, without saying much, grateful to him\nfor not renewing the subject which had just been dropped and hoping he\nhad not attached any importance to it; but her attention was all alert\nwhen after a pause he inquired: \"Have you good accounts of Miss Bennet\nsince she left town?\"\n\nShe tried to collect her scattered ideas, to remember what Kitty\nexpected of her. Yes, she had had good accounts; she thought her friend\nwas very well and, she believed, enjoying the country, though it\nprobably seemed very quiet to her after such a long visit to London.\n\nWilliam Price assented, and said that Miss Bennet had so much freshness\nand enthusiasm, she could enjoy many things, and enter keenly into them\nall.\n\nGeorgiana fully endorsed this, but thought that Kitty had had a\nparticularly delightful visit to town this year and really regretted\nleaving.\n\nWilliam Price said that Miss Bennet's friends were very sorry to lose\nher.\n\n\"This is all very well,\" thought Georgiana, \"but we do not get any\nfarther. Am I shy of him, or is he shy of me? Oh, I wonder what Kitty\nwould like me to say? If I were Mrs. Knightley I could probably bring in\nthe inconstancy of sailors with good effect. I suppose she thinks that I\nmean to throw a doubt on Mr. Price; how unlucky that it should have had\nthat appearance!\"\n\nShe was assisted in her meditations by Mr. Price's remarking that he had\nnever been in Derbyshire, and imagined it to be a beautiful county, and\nthis afforded her the opportunity of descanting on the loveliness of its\nscenery and the particular attractions of the country round Desborough\nPark. She added that she hoped there would be nothing to prevent him\nfrom seeing it for himself that autumn, and he replied warmly, agreeing\nand saying that if he were still his own master at that time nothing\nshould prevent it. A question or two about Pemberley followed, and the\nrelative positions of the two houses; he had heard of it as being a show\nplace from his sister, Mrs. Bertram, who had made a tour through the\nmidland counties to visit all the cathedrals and old churches, but, he\ndeclared, had actually been so worldly as to look at one or two of the\ngrand mansions as well. Georgiana questioned its worldliness, and was\ntold that his brother and sister were the dearest people, but dreadfully\ngood; they thought everything wrong.\n\nThis description, of which Georgiana would have liked to have heard\nmore, was interrupted by a song, and at its conclusion Mr. Price was\nwaiting with the inquiry: \"Do you return to Pemberley soon, Miss Darcy?\"\n\n\"In about a month, I think; but I leave town in a fortnight's time to\nstay with my aunt at Hunsford.\"\n\n\"I am leaving London almost immediately, I am sorry to say,\" said\nWilliam Price. \"I have to go down to Portsmouth, where my mother is\nchanging houses, and as she has that and a quantity of lawyers' business\non her hands, since my father died, she wishes me to help her.\"\n\nGeorgiana could not but approve of this decision, but she thought it\npartly accounted for the young man's being in far less good spirits this\nevening than on the previous occasion; he evidently did not like to quit\nLondon. She was endeavouring to think of a way of conveying to him that\nshe would see Kitty almost as soon as she reached home, when the opening\nof a solo on the harp caused her to forget everything but the sound of\nthe instrument, in which she had always taken extreme delight. Mr.\nPrice, too, listened with close attention, and when it was over, and\nthey were commending the performance, he exclaimed: \"The harp always\nreminds me of one of the most charming women I ever knew, who used to\nplay it--still does, I daresay, at all events it is associated\ninseparably with her.\"\n\nCuriosity as well as politeness impelled Georgiana to ask for more\nparticulars, for she privately wished very much to know what her\ncompanion's idea of a charming woman might be, and he answered readily\nenough: \"She was a lady I first met some years ago at Mansfield before\nmy sister's marriage; she was a friend of the whole Bertram family, and,\nin a way, of my sister's also; but circumstances divided them, Miss\nCrawford's people left the neighbourhood, and now I only see her\noccasionally in town.\"\n\nMiss Darcy's start and heightening of colour did not escape him; he\nlooked inquiringly at her, and question and answer broke from them both\nsimultaneously. \"Yes, I have met Miss Crawford,\" said Georgiana, \"what a\nvery strange thing! I was introduced to her in the gardens the other day\nby--by a mutual friend, and I had heard of her before from my brother\nand sister.\"\n\n\"That is indeed strange! I wish I had known when I was with her last. I\nhave been seeing a good deal of Mrs. Grant, her sister, and Miss\nCrawford lately, being myself that abomination, an idle man about town,\nbut it has just this once had its agreeable side.\"\n\nGeorgiana murmured that she had supposed he was seldom in London for so\nlong, and he continued, with perfect ease and frankness: \"Quite true;\nindeed, I have never before had time to see the sights; and Miss\nCrawford, who is a regular Londoner, takes me about to them, in order,\nshe says, to waste my time as usefully as possible. To-day we were at a\npicture gallery, and last week we went to see an exhibition of silver,\nmodels of ships, most interesting and unusual it was; I would not have\nmissed it for the world. The curious design and rigging of them! I\nshould like to have shown them to you, Miss Darcy.\"\n\nGeorgiana echoed his wish, but was so much interested in pursuing her\ntheory that Miss Crawford was the handsome young woman Mrs. Hurst had\nspoken of, that she ventured one more question: \"You said you had known\nMiss Crawford for some time, Mr. Price?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, for years; looking back on it, I must have been quite a small\nboy when we first met; at all events, I regarded her as being one of my\nelders. That is a very ungallant thing to say, is it not? I do not know\nwhy I said it. But I always had a great regard for her, and when the\nfamilies were alienated I always tried to keep in touch with her and\nMrs. Grant, for the severance was through no fault of hers, only her\nbrother's--though I know the blame for it has often been laid at her\ndoor.\"\n\nHow easy it is to believe in people, if only we wish to do so! This\nspeech fully accounted for all that had been heard of Mr. Price, and\nacquitted him of any lightness of conduct; he had merely been faithful\nto an old friend; and Miss Crawford was only proved more worthy than\nbefore of Colonel Fitzwilliam's esteem. Georgiana longed to inquire\nfurther, to see if Mr. Price could throw more light on the recent\nperplexing event, but felt it would be presumption to do so, and he sat\nmusing for a few moments, unaware of the sentiments he had aroused in\nhis companion, until, in response to a remark from her, he exclaimed\nwarmly: \"Yes, she is indeed a beautiful woman, and as charming as\nbeautiful. You would like her, Miss Darcy, if you knew her. I heard this\nevening that she was engaged; I do not know if it is true, but I am\ninclined to hope not if I heard the name aright; still, one must presume\nit will be all for the best.\"\n\nHe spoke the last words somewhat hurriedly, as if not wishing to dwell\non them, but could not overlook the anxiety in Georgiana's face and\nvoice. \"Is she engaged, Mr. Price? I thought perhaps that might be the\ncase. Do you know to whom it is?\"\n\n\"I heard a name mentioned, Miss Darcy, but I do not like--I am uncertain\nwhether it is correct--I should like to verify it first,\" said William\nPrice, in some embarrassment.\n\n\"Of course, I quite understand. It would not be fair to say anything\nuntil you are sure. But no doubt it is true.\" And Georgiana, with a\nsigh, fell into a reverie, which her companion, observing her with\nsolicitude, did not venture to interrupt.\n\nThey were divided a few minutes later, Georgiana being called upon to\ncontribute a solo upon the pianoforte, and she could not help feeling\ngratified to see that William Price listened attentively to her playing,\nfor the love of music was in her eyes, an additionally attractive\nfeature in anyone's character. These were the pleasantest impressions\nshe derived from the evening, for on the whole they had been sad ones;\nshe had inadvertently exposed herself to being misunderstood by Mrs.\nKnightley, and perhaps by Mrs. Wentworth, for whose esteem she cared far\nmore; she had not been able to say one word to help Kitty, and would\nhave no news to give of the kind that Kitty was longing for; and, worst\nof all, her fears for her cousin were confirmed; instead of anyone being\nable to help him, he could only be told that the disappointment he had\nexperienced was a final and permanent one. Georgiana's thoughts were all\nfor him; they hardly even strayed to speculate upon Miss Crawford's\nchoice, except for a touch of wondering pity for one who had possessed\nhis regard and thrown it away for another's. No; the world was\ndeterminedly awry, and Georgiana went to bed longing for the comfort of\nElizabeth and Pemberley, and dreading the days to be spent under the\njudicial and unsympathetic eye of her Aunt Catherine.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XII\n\n\nElizabeth and her husband desired Georgiana's return as much as she did\nherself, but Lady Catherine had been very urgent that her niece should\nvisit her, and they judged it right that she should take the opportunity\nof going, while comparatively near Rosings. Georgiana had never before\nstayed there without the protection of her brother's or sister's\npresence; but she found it to be less alarming than she feared, for her\naunt was probably disposed to be more complaisant and less dictatorial\nto her than to any other living creature; and while not comprehending\nher niece's character in the least, wished to make her happy, if it were\npossible to be happy, in the best Rosings manner. So Georgiana\nobediently played the piano, joined in games of quadrille, drove out\nwith her cousin in the pony chaise, endured her aunt's admonishments,\nand listened politely to Lady Catherine's long stories about her own\nyouth; and the time did at length pass away, though not until she had\nmany times decided that London, even with the agitations that it had\nafforded this year, was far less wearing to the temper and spirits.\n\nThe date of her homecoming was fixed for the fifth of August, and an\nescort was unexpectedly found in the person of Mr. Bennet, who had made\none of his sudden resolves to go and stay with his two daughters, Mrs.\nBennet having the prospect of her sister, Mrs. Phillips's, companionship\nthroughout that month. Georgiana was enchanted when this decision was\nconveyed to her, as it ensured that no postponement of the journey would\nbe made upon any pretext. Mr. Bennet had proposed visiting his daughters\nand bringing back Kitty, and the first part of this suggestion was\nwarmly welcomed; the second they could not promise to accede to, but Mr.\nBennet would be conferring a signal service if he would meet Miss Darcy\nin London and bring her home. Mr. Bennet declared himself quite\nagreeable; let Miss Darcy name her own day for starting, and it should\nbe his; but once named, it must be considered fixed, for Mr. Bennet, it\nmust be noted, had a wife and five daughters, and knew something of the\nvariability of the female mind. He had, however, never been in less\ndanger of a change of plans than on this occasion.\n\nElizabeth had received the first intimation of her father's intended\nvisit shortly after dispatching to Georgiana the letter which has been\nmentioned, and having now so many matters to talk over with Jane, she\ndetermined on going to Desborough without delay. An hour or two's chat\nwould not be sufficient, and she therefore arranged to stay for a night\nand return the following afternoon, and pressed Darcy to accompany her;\nbut this he declined to do, telling her that he should only be in the\nway when she, Jane and Kitty were putting their heads together for a\nfeminine conclave, and Bingley was as bad as the rest.\n\nIt happened that Jane was alone when she arrived, Bingley being out\nriding with Kitty and Mr. Morland; but he was not long in returning,\nand when Kitty had greeted her sister, and retired to change her dress,\nhe joined the conference, as Darcy had foretold.\n\n\"Well, Elizabeth,\" he began, \"and how do you find Kitty? I never saw her\nin better looks. And has Jane told you about my young friend in London,\nwho, it appears, is an admirer of hers? I declare I had not an idea of\nit when I asked him to come down, but it turns out very well as it\nhappens.\"\n\nElizabeth admitted herself informed, and asked Bingley for particulars\nof Mr. Price's character, appearance and manners, of which it was to be\npresumed he could give a more reasonable account than Kitty. He spoke\nwarmly in the young man's praise, and mentioned what he had heard of his\nfamily and connections from Mr. Yates.\n\n\"It seems most satisfactory,\" said Elizabeth, \"and his being a friend of\nthe Wentworths is a further recommendation. I am quite looking forward\nto meeting him, though time alone will show if there is anything in it.\"\n\n\"Kitty has set her heart on it to such an extent, that I feel extremely\nanxious that she may have no disappointment,\" said Jane with tenderness.\n\"It would be enough to make her ill, her sensibilities are so acute! One\ncan see how she watches for the letters from Mrs. Knightley, and the\neagerness with which she reads them.\"\n\n\"Whatever Mrs. Knightley may do,\" said Elizabeth, \"in my opinion we\nshould not be acting wisely by Kitty in encouraging her to talk and\nthink much about it. On the young man's side it has not gone beyond a\npromising inclination, I infer, and it may never be more.\"\n\n\"You are a prudent creature, Elizabeth,\" exclaimed her brother-in-law;\n\"but as regards Kitty, your precautions are too late, as I know to my\ncost. There was I thinking I was bringing down the very girl for Morland\nto fall in love with--indeed, I had almost told him so--and now it\nappears she is more than half engaged to someone else, and what good is\nthat to a man who wants a wife to establish in that big house of his?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Elizabeth, laughing, \"you need not reproach yourself,\nCharles. A house and living were promised to Mr. Morland; but a wife, I\nbelieve, was not in the bond.\"\n\n\"It would have been very pleasant to have provided him with one,\nnevertheless,\" returned Bingley. \"As it is, they see a great deal of\neach other, and are such excellent friends, that if it were not all such\na profound secret it would be incumbent on me to give him a hint of the\nstate of things.\"\n\nElizabeth looked at her sister for confirmation of this, and Jane\nreplied: \"Yes, they are good friends. Kitty seems to enjoy his\ncompanionship, and he has evidently a strong liking for her, so that I\nsometimes feel afraid lest it should develop into anything likely to\ncause him pain hereafter. But, of course, as I have repeatedly told\nBingley, even in view of such a contingency we have no right to betray\nour knowledge of Kitty's private hopes.\"\n\nAs Mr. Morland dined at Desborough, Elizabeth had an opportunity of\nobserving the young people, and she thought she had seldom seen Kitty to\ngreater advantage; her particularly delicate beauty was heightened\npartly by excitement and partly by the healthful country life. She was\nat perfect ease, happy with her sisters and Mr. Bingley, and treating\nMr. Morland much as she would have treated an elderly friend of the\nfamily, not as a man to be captivated. The feeling of frank\ngoodfellowship which he seemed to inspire was a simple and wholesome\none, and Elizabeth tried to rest assured that Mr. Morland was aware of\nKitty's attitude towards him and wished for nothing more. That, indeed,\nwas the impression he gave; but the longer she was with him, the more\nclearly she perceived that now his circumstances were more settled a\nquiet contentment, an evenness of temper, had become habitual to him,\nwithout taking away the earnestness, the steadfastness of purpose, which\nunderlay the whole. She felt that she did not yet thoroughly know Mr.\nMorland; and the following morning, in the course of a brief talk with\nKitty, she suggested to her in the gentlest possible way of the\ndesirability of not allowing so excellent a young man, who was also a\nsolitary one, to entertain thoughts of her which might be so much more\neasily admitted to his mind than expelled from it. Kitty had just been\ngiving wings to her imagination in a description of Mr. Price, which\nElizabeth had felt herself hard-hearted to be obliged to check, and the\nyoung girl with difficulty came down to earth again to Mr. Morland, to\nassure Elizabeth, with all haste of indifference, that she was positive\nthat Morland did not think of her in that way; he only cared for his\nparish and his house, and as for his being solitary--why, his sister\nSarah was coming to live with him.\n\nElizabeth was compelled to be content, and, in addition, she secured a\npromise from Jane that Kitty should come to Pemberley about the middle\nof September. Kitty was delighted with the arrangement, so long as there\nwas one which secured her return to Desborough for the shooting-party\nearly in November. Her eldest sister exhibited an almost equal amount of\neagerness on her behalf to settle this important matter; and Kitty, who\nhad been living in terror lest some cruel fate should intervene to send\nher back to Longbourn before that time, breathed more freely when her\nsisters undertook to obtain her father's consent to such a long absence.\n\nMr. Bennet and Georgiana duly arrived at Pemberley, and were welcomed\nwith all the warmth that affection could show. They had been a curiously\nassorted pair of travelling companions, and their relations had\nspeculated with amusement upon their chances of congeniality. Neither\nbeing talkers, they had at least had that in common, though after their\narrival Georgiana smilingly reproached Mr. Bennet with having intently\nstudied a book of Latin poetry throughout the whole journey, and Mr.\nBennet gravely apologized for not having selected a volume more suitable\nfor reading aloud; he was sorry he had not been at more pains to while\naway the time for a young lady who was exceedingly punctual, and always\nready when the carriage came round. For his own part, he declared that\nhe felt himself becoming more conversational with every mile of the way,\nin proof of which he twice voluntarily told Elizabeth during the first\nhour that he was glad to see her again, and announced that, after his\nown library, there was no place he would sooner be in than Mr. Darcy's.\n\nThe first evening was a cheerful one, there was so much to say, so many\nfriends to inquire after, adventures to relate, and plans to detail. The\nchildren were brought in, and, according to the time-honoured custom\neverywhere, were pronounced to have grown, though it is to be feared\nthat Mr. Bennet was not an ideal grandparent, for he so far\nmiscalculated as to bring them toys which they could not properly\nappreciate for some years at least; and Elizabeth wanted to hear of\nlittle William and Elizabeth Collins, with whom Georgiana had often\nplayed at Hunsford Parsonage, and who were described as being strikingly\nlike their father and mother respectively.\n\nIt was not until the following day, when the sisters were alone\ntogether, that any words passed between them concerning Colonel\nFitzwilliam. Elizabeth showed Georgiana a few brief lines she had\nreceived from him, stating little more than the bare facts of his\ndeparture and its cause. \"She is engaged, and it is all over for me now.\nAt all events, I know the worst,\" he wrote. \"Do not be too compassionate\nfor me, Elizabeth. I have been a fool, to think that anything so bright\nand lovely should become mine. Yet I did not think she would bestow\nherself where she has. I was a laggard, I suppose, and I threw my chance\naway in Bath; and how could she wait until I had reinstated myself? No,\nmy dream is over. You will hear of her engagement, no doubt, and I beg\nyou to tell her that I join with you in wishes for her happiness. I\nshall be with you at Pemberley before long. Georgiana is an angel. I did\nnot deserve from her one quarter of the kindness she showed me.\"\n\nIn a postscript he added: \"Will Darcy trust me to choose him a horse? I\nhave seen a beautiful pair of bays, that would suit your large carriage,\nbesides a perfect chestnut hunter.\"\n\nGeorgiana sighed and smiled over the letter, and Elizabeth said: \"Yes,\nhe evidently does not wish us to think he is overwhelmed by it, though\nfrom what he does _not_ say I can realize the depth of his feeling. It\nis incredible; for, of course, it must be Sir Walter Elliot.\"\n\nSir Walter's was only a name to Georgiana, a vague recollection from the\nlast year at Bath, and she replied that she had heard of the engagement\nfrom another source, without particulars. Elizabeth gave a vigorous\ndescription of him and ended by saying that she should wait and see if\nthe necessity for writing to Miss Crawford arose, for she did not feel\nmuch disposed to congratulate her.\n\nKitty's affairs were, of course, passed under review, and Elizabeth was\nsomewhat surprised to find that Georgiana was a staunch upholder of the\nnotion that William Price was likely to make her an offer, as she had\nfancied that the accounts might have been exaggerated, and that\nGeorgiana would be the one to take a sober and dispassionate view. But\nher asseverations of her belief that Mr. Price's truth and steadiness,\nand in Kitty's being unlikely to have deceived herself in this case,\nwent farther to convince Elizabeth than anything she had heard before.\n\nThe next few weeks passed in tranquil enjoyment for all the persons in\nthe Pemberley circle, in which must be comprised the party from\nDesborough, as no plan of any importance could be carried through\nwithout the joining of forces, and the inclusion of Mr. Morland on the\none side and the Ferrars from Pemberley Rectory on the other. The\nBingleys, with the two young people, frequently drove over to spend a\nday or two days, and when Mr. Bennet removed to Desborough towards the\nend of August, it was not felt to be so much of a break-up as a changing\nof the scene of their activities. Boating expeditions, rides over the\nmoors, blackberry gatherings, or evenings spent quietly at home in games\nor music, something could always be found to suit the tastes of a party\nof people who were bent on finding pleasure in each other's company;\neven Kitty felt that only one thing was wanting to fill her cup of\nhappiness to the brim, for her father had sanctioned her staying on\nuntil November, the month, she hoped, which would see its overflow.\n\nFor one person, however, this peaceful time was about to end in pain and\ndisappointment. Mrs. Bingley and her sister were sitting indoors\ntogether one morning in the middle of September, when Mr. Morland was\nobserved approaching the house. He was such a frequent caller that it\nhad become a habit with him to walk straight in, and the ladies, after\nwaiting for some time, wondered at his non-appearance, and still more at\nthe intelligence brought by a servant, in answer to Jane's summons, that\nMr. Morland had asked only for Mr. Bennet, and had been shown into the\nlibrary.\n\n\"What can he want with my father?\" said Jane, a suspicion of the truth\nshooting across her mind and checking her utterance, as she glanced\nanxiously at her sister; but no such idea seemed to have occurred to\nKitty, who innocently conjectured their interview to be a literary\nconference, or a discussion that had arisen out of Mr. Morland's\nsermon-making.\n\nMr. Bennet, on perceiving his visitor, might have anticipated something\nof the kind, but Mr. Morland's first words corrected him. The young\nman's errand was indeed nothing more or less than to make a formal\nproposal for the hand of Mr. Bennet's daughter and to request permission\nto address her. He was nervous, as men in his situation are apt to be,\nbut genuine feeling and sound sense enabled him to state his case well,\nif not very fluently, as he represented the strength of his attachment\nand described his worldly position and prospects.\n\nMr. Bennet had long ceased to be surprised at receiving applications of\nthe kind, however unexpected they might be, and certainly this one found\nhim quite unprepared. What little thought he had given to the subject\nhad certainly not led him to the supposition of Mr. Morland's becoming\nhis son-in-law, and he endeavoured to make his answer a discouraging\none.\n\n\"My daughter will be much honoured by your high opinion of her, Mr.\nMorland, and I have no reason to think ill of your pretensions; but I\nmust admit that I have not remarked on her part any strong prepossession\nin your favour.\"\n\n\"It is one of the things I have found most charming in Miss Bennet's\ncharacter, sir,\" replied Morland, \"that she would not easily give her\nheart away, or readily suppose a man to be enslaved by her. No one else\ncould have failed to perceive the depth of my admiration, but she has\nseemed quite unconscious of it, though at the same time I am fully aware\nthat there is no brilliancy or distinction about me, nothing to attract\nanyone who herself possesses a full measure of those qualities.\"\n\nHe looked so downcast that Mr. Bennet remarked: \"If that were the\nquestion, Mr. Morland, you might set your mind at rest, for my daughter,\nthough a very good girl, is not brilliant, nor would she be comfortable\nwith a husband of that description.\"\n\nThis observation inspired Mr. Morland to a fairly long speech, in which\nhe extolled Kitty's amiable qualities and dwelt on his own demerits, but\nnotwithstanding the contrast thereby presented, he was able to deduce a\nnumber of excellent reasons for his being allowed to propose to Miss\nBennet without delay. Mr. Bennet heard him in silence, and at the end\nreplied that, though flattered by Mr. Morland's first referring to him,\nwho was merely the father of the young lady, he could not answer for his\ndaughter's sentiments; he had found that in these matters his girls had\nalways made up their own minds, and no doubt would continue to do so.\n\n\"Indeed, yes, it is with Miss Bennet that I must plead my own cause; but\nyou will not refuse me your sanction?\" said the young man, eagerly. \"You\nthink so far favourably of my suit that you will place no bar in the way\nof my--I trust I may in time say _our_ perfect happiness?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Morland, the way to your perfect happiness is open as far as I\nam concerned,\" replied Mr. Bennet, taking up a book.\n\nMorland's satisfaction at having the father even passively on his side\nwas very great, and he spoke his gratitude very warmly, mingling with it\nsuch praises of Kitty, and such rosy prognostications of the future, as\ncaused Mr. Bennet to reply, in characteristic fashion: \"Let me know when\nthe time comes to wish you joy, Mr. Morland, and I will do it, but life\nis so uncertain that I think for the present I had better refrain. Have\nyou ascertained whether Kitty can cook, make her own gowns, and trim\nhats? I understand it is a great promoter of married happiness when the\nwife can do so, and I am not sure whether all my girls have turned their\neducation to such good account.\"\n\nMr. Morland only replied by asking if he might be allowed to see Miss\nBennet at once, and her father left the room, foreseeing that, whatever\nhappened, he should not have one more quiet hour during that day. His\nanticipations were soon in the way to be fulfilled, for on finding his\ndaughters, and sending Kitty to the library, he had to give Jane an\noutline of what had just passed, then repeat it to Bingley, who joined\nthem, and listened to their exclamations of surprise, and regret at the\nprobable downfall of Mr. Morland's hopes. Jane and Bingley were both too\nconvinced of Kitty's prior attachment to have the slightest expectation\nof his success, and Mr. Bennet was put in full possession of the facts\nrelating to it, while they anxiously awaited the termination of the\ninterview.\n\nIt came, after some minutes, in a glimpse of Kitty emerging from the\nlibrary and hurrying upstairs with streaming eyes, and while they all\ndebated as to their next move, Mr. Morland was seen to cross the hall\nrapidly, looking nowhere but in front of him, and leave the house with\nprecipitation. Jane herself, almost equally distressed, longed to go to\nKitty, and Bingley questioned whether he ought not to hasten after the\nyoung man, while Mr. Bennet was disposed to think they would be better\nleft to themselves for a time, and wished heartily that there were only\njust enough lovers in the world to go round, one to each young lady, and\nnone over.\n\nIn spite of this, Jane was not long in finding her way to her agitated\nsister and in showing her the tenderest consideration. Kitty's distress\nwas very great, and also very sincere, for she had in truth been far\nfrom guessing that Mr. Morland took a more than common interest in her,\nand as is usual in such cases, the declaration of the young man's love\nwoke in her feelings which she had not known to exist, of reciprocal\nkindness and even affection, which only did not share the nature and\nstrength of his. Kitty could never have been hard-hearted to any lover,\nleast of all to one whom she liked as much as she did James Morland, and\nhis devotion touched her as deeply as the knowledge that she could not\naccept it wounded her. Between regrets for what had happened, pity for\nhim and for herself, and the excited thoughts of William Price which the\nincident itself was bound to evoke, she was in a sad state, and Jane\neasily prevailed upon her to have her dinner upstairs and go early to\nbed. Not so easily could she check the tears which flowed continuously,\nand Jane, to occupy her mind and body, proposed that she should go\nto-morrow to Pemberley, instead of in three days' time, as arranged;\nshe could very well be sent over, and the change would be beneficial;\nbesides, she was not really leaving them, for there was the November\nvisit to look forward to. Kitty caught at the suggestion, and declining\nthe offices of the maid, began to busy herself about her packing, as\nJane hoped she would do, while the latter descended to consult with her\nhusband and father.\n\nMr. Bennet and Bingley both approved, and Jane hastily wrote a few lines\nto Elizabeth to apprise her of what had happened, that she might be\nprepared for Kitty's arrival. The two gentlemen walked to the nearest\npost town to convey the letter; and after dinner the indefatigable\nBingley again set out, this time to the Rectory, to perform the same\nkind office by James Morland as his wife had been doing by Kitty. The\nyoung man, though calmer, proved far more unreceptive of consolation. He\nhad felt his rebuff acutely, for Kitty had been too much taken by\nsurprise, too sure of herself, to make it otherwise than decisive, and\neven the modest hopes he had ventured to entertain, of being able to\nmake more progress with her once the subject was opened between them,\nhad been most thoroughly dispelled. Miss Bennet would not hear another\nword of it--begged him never to speak of it again--with tears reproached\nhim for having spoilt everything, so that in addition to his own\ndisappointment he had the pain of feeling that she thought less well of\nhim than before. Bingley could deny this, but could not affirm anything\nelse likely to give him comfort. It remained for Morland himself to\ndeclare, which he did in a firm though melancholy tone, that he\nregretted having distressed Miss Bennet, and would endeavour so to meet\nher in the future that she would not suffer through being reminded of\nit by any act of word of his. Bingley commended his courage, told him of\nKitty's departure, and begged him to continue coming to Desborough just\nthe same; and walked home with a full report of what had just passed.\n\nJane shook her head over it, for, while sympathizing with both, she was\nmore truly sorry for Mr. Morland, since for him she could see no\nimmediate prospect of compensation, in spite of her father's assurances\nthat a young clergyman was seldom allowed to remain inconsolable for\nmore than six months, and if Kitty's other young man only did what was\nexpected of him, her fate would be a certainty in half that time.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIII\n\n\nNeedless to say, Kitty was heartily welcomed by Georgiana and Elizabeth,\nand given every opportunity to relieve her mind by descriptions of the\ntragical affair in all its aspects. Both regretted it deeply for Mr.\nMorland's sake, and Elizabeth privately did so for Kitty's sake, having\nsuch a good opinion of him as to make her wish that Kitty could have\nbeen persuaded out of her fancy for a young man, who, however excellent,\nwas comparatively a stranger to them all, and whose intentions, at\npresent, were extremely uncertain. She would have rejoiced if Kitty and\nMorland could have made each other happy, and had entertained a slight\nhope that her hint to Kitty might perhaps have helped matters, in\ndirecting her thoughts into another channel, but it seemed to be of no\navail, and Georgiana gave her friend her warmest support, implying\nentire agreement with her point of view. \"I could not help it, now,\ncould I, Georgiana? You know yourself, Lizzie, that I never dreamt it.\nHow could I do anything else but refuse him outright? I was amazingly\ngrieved to do so, but you know very well, Georgiana, that if I could\nthink of one man more than another, _he_ is not that one.\" She paused\nfor assent, which Georgiana gave by a silent caress, and then continued:\n\"It is all so unfortunate. It will never be as pleasant at Desborough\nnow. Poor Mr. Morland! I wish I had not had to hurt him. He does want\nsomeone so badly in the Rectory.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear, do not make yourself ill with these vain regrets,\" said\nElizabeth. \"It is, as you say, very unfortunate, but no one blames you.\nIf you could not care for him, you could not do it, and someone else\nwill have to inhabit that nice Rectory.\"\n\nKitty looked as if this prospect were not very pleasing either, but\nGeorgiana, seeing what Elizabeth wished, began to talk cheerfully of\nsomething else, and Kitty gradually joined in, though whenever the two\ngirls were alone together she found it difficult to abstain long from\nreferring to some branch of the subject.\n\nGeorgiana's loyalty and patience never failed, but she wished for\nNovember almost as earnestly as Kitty herself, so that matters might\nreach some definite conclusion, for Kitty's restlessness had\nconsiderably increased since she had received James Morland's offer, and\nshe was constantly nervous and excitable and not mistress of herself. On\nthe day when the Bingleys and Mr. Bennet came over for the latter to\ntake leave before returning to Longbourn, this was specially noticeable\nin her state of anxious flutter when drawing Jane aside to inquire after\nMr. Morland. Mr. Bennet bade her farewell gravely and more\naffectionately than was his wont, telling her that he left her in good\nhands, and would only give her one piece of advice, namely, that second\nthoughts were sometimes best. Kitty blushed deeply and could not pretend\nto misunderstand him, but told Georgiana afterwards that it was\nimpossible to have better second thoughts when Price was the first.\n\nWith his elder daughter Mr. Bennet was rather more explicit, telling\nElizabeth that he considered it was a great pity that so unobjectionable\na young man should have been sent about his business. Elizabeth entirely\nagreed with him, and thought it would not be going too far to express\nMr. Morland's praise in even warmer terms.\n\n\"He will never set the Thames on fire, but there seems good stuff in\nhim,\" was Mr. Bennet's reply. \"When he proposed for her I had not taken\nmuch notice of him, except to think him a tolerably sensible fellow, and\nof course I had to readjust my ideas; but I soon began to see that he\nmust not be judged by that alone. I have really liked him better, too,\nfor his way of taking his refusal.\"\n\n\"My dear father, it does not always indicate a want of sense to wish to\nbe married,\" interposed Elizabeth.\n\n\"Perhaps not, but Morland is much better off as he is than in marrying a\ngirl he knows so little about. Kitty is flighty and expensive; she ought\nto stay longer with you and Jane, and not think of being married for the\nnext ten years.\"\n\nElizabeth smiled and said she thought that it was unnecessary, but that\nit would certainly be better for Kitty to marry a clergyman than an\nofficer in the navy, who would be compelled to spend long periods away\nfrom home.\n\n\"As to that, of course it is a complete absurdity, and I cannot think\nwhy you women, who are so fond of making matches, did not originate\nsomething less ridiculously unsuitable among yourselves.\"\n\nElizabeth thought it wiser not to explain who actually had originated\nthe idea, and said after a pause: \"You were saying that you have liked\nMr. Morland better of late?\"\n\n\"Yes, he has positively shown some sort of self-command and dignity. He\nturned up at the house a day or two afterwards, apparently _not_ bent\non making us all uncomfortable by the sight of his misery, as most\nrejected lovers do. Besides, Bingley had had the foresight to produce\nsome excellent port.\"\n\n\"I hear from Jane,\" said Elizabeth, \"that he does not avoid or seek the\nmention of Kitty, and she thinks he is trying to give up all hope of\nher.\"\n\n\"Her absence for a few weeks will no doubt materially assist him,\" said\nMr. Bennet.\n\nKitty seized the opportunity offered by this visit to speak a private\nword to her brother-in-law with reference to the hero, as Bingley\npersisted in calling him. She herself had no news, for Mrs. Knightley's\nfrequent letters reported him still at Portsmouth, and Bingley had heard\nnothing, but promised to write and renew his invitation as soon as\nOctober was fairly in.\n\nThe same silence prevailed at Pemberley with regard to Miss Crawford. No\nannouncement of her marriage had reached any of them, and Elizabeth had\na half inclination to make some inquiries, but was dissuaded by Darcy,\nwho said: \"Whatever precisely has happened, Elizabeth, we can be sure of\none thing, that Miss Crawford has allowed Fitzwilliam to understand that\nshe does not wish him to approach her again. Under these circumstances\nit is better that you should have no news to give him.\"\n\nElizabeth sighed as she agreed to the wisdom of this decision, but when\nshortly after her father's departure a letter was received from Colonel\nFitzwilliam to say he would be returning at the end of the month, she\ncould not help wishing that she was more fully informed of the present\nstate of affairs. It would be a relief, even though a sad one, to\nFitzwilliam's mind to know that Miss Crawford was actually married and\nhe would be unselfish enough to wish to hear that she was happy. Nothing\noccurred, however, to enlighten them, and Fitzwilliam arrived on the\nappointed day, looking much as usual except for a few more lines about\nthe eyes and an increased number of grey hairs.\n\nIt was the first time he and Georgiana had been together at Pemberley\nsince the rupture of their engagement, and both must have felt conscious\nof it, Georgiana in particular being prepared to be miserable for a\ntime, from the belief that her cousin, instead of being cheered and\ninvigorated as formerly by his return home, must be reminded at every\nturn of the failure of their experiment, the failure caused by her\nwretched weakness and incapacity. Worse still, her brother must be\nreminded of it, and there might be a repetition of his stern looks, his\ncold manner. She trembled at the thought, unaware that Darcy had long\nbeen persuaded of the wisdom of their parting, ever since events in Bath\nhad shown him where his cousin's real affections were likely to be\nbestowed, and the only difference which Georgiana perceived after\nFitzwilliam's arrival was in the particular kindness he showed her, and\nthe complete renewal of the old comfortable relations amongst them all.\n\nWhen inquiries after the Hursts and Mrs. Annesley had been made, and\nGeorgiana had mentioned the dinner-party and the persons who had been\npresent, little more was said with reference to London; indeed, there\nwas little more for either to say, for Georgiana dared not refer to the\nperson who had chiefly occupied his mind there. Fitzwilliam talked of\nhis book and of Ireland, inquired about the prospects of the shooting,\nshowed interest in the minutest details of life in the neighbourhood,\nand in every way endeavoured to prove that he was exactly his old self;\nand only when walking with Elizabeth in the Park one morning did he\nbetray how far that was from being the case.\n\nThere was no doubt that his disappointment had coloured his whole life.\nHe had allowed himself to think of Miss Crawford, and to build high upon\nhis hopes, and to find himself again mistaken had been a blow which cut\nat the foundations of all his happiness. His gaiety was feigned, his\npursuits had lost their zest, his friends no longer sufficed him: and as\nhe said to Elizabeth, he had felt he had better adopt some country\noccupation and settle down to it, and there grow old as quietly and\nquickly as might be.\n\nElizabeth's heart was wrung; the spectacle of her cousin's fine nature\nlocked away, as it were, in a closed room, as a thing no one had any\nneed for, was inexpressively painful to her, and nothing else would have\ncaused her to venture upon a reopening of the subject which he himself\nhad not approached. With the utmost gentleness she spoke a few words of\ncommiseration, and then, still proceeding with extreme caution, she told\nhim of the absence of news and her assumption that Miss Crawford's\nmarriage with Sir Walter Elliot had been delayed.\n\n\"I daresay it has,\" returned Colonel Fitzwilliam, with a kind of\nlistlessness, striking with his stick at the head of some tall grasses\nwhich bordered their path.\n\n\"There can be no doubt of it, I suppose?\" pursued Elizabeth.\n\n\"None at all, I should imagine,\" replied the Colonel. \"Miss Crawford is\nnot the kind of woman who would break her word, once the engagement had\nbeen announced.\"\n\n\"No, of course not,\" said Elizabeth; \"but I had expected that she or\nMrs. Grant would have written to me, or even Mrs. Wentworth, as they\nmust know I should be interested.\"\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam could not immediately recall anything of Mrs.\nWentworth beyond her name, and on being reminded that she was Sir\nWalter Elliot's daughter, presently replied: \"I do not think it\naltogether surprising she should not have written to you. She probably\ncares little for the marriage, and still less for the one which it was\nanticipated would follow it--I mean Miss Elliot's to Mr. Crawford.\"\n\nThis was a new idea to Elizabeth, and while she was pondering over it,\nand the inferences to be drawn from it, Colonel Fitzwilliam broke the\nsilence by saying: \"Perhaps we had better not speak of this anymore,\nElizabeth. I know your great kindness of heart, but I feel it does no\ngood, rather harm, to be reviving thoughts which I must in honour\nsuppress as much as possible. I was anxious to know whether you had\nheard anything, and to ask you again, when you have the chance, to tell\nher that I wish her well; but now we have mentioned it, it would, I\nthink, be best for my contemptibly weak character to put it as far away\nas possible.\"\n\nWith tears in her eyes, Elizabeth assured him that through the tenderest\nregard for him, not through any fear of overtaxing his fortitude, she\nwould respect his wishes, but could not help begging him to remain with\nthem at Pemberley as heretofore, so as to give them an opportunity of\nshowing him how completely their happiness was bound up with his, and of\nmaking use of any opportunity which might arise for them to be of\nservice to him. Fitzwilliam gratefully promised to stay for the present,\nand said that his only engagement was to go to some friends in\nLeicestershire in November, for the hunting.\n\nElizabeth was, nevertheless, not perfectly satisfied, and took occasion\nto ask Georgiana shortly afterwards whether it was from Mrs. Wentworth\nthat she had heard confirmation of the fact that Sir Walter Elliot was\nengaged to Miss Crawford.\n\n\"No,\" said Georgiana, in surprise, \"it was from Mr. Price. Mrs.\nWentworth never mentioned it. Mrs. Wentworth! Of course, I recollect\nnow, she is Sir Walter Elliot's daughter; but at the time I never\nthought of it, for, you see, I did not know Sir Walter was the man.\"\n\n\"Very true; I had also forgotten that you did not know,\" said Elizabeth,\n\"and would never connect her with Miss Crawford. I have been thinking\nthat I should like, for our own satisfaction, to know when the wedding\nis going to take place, and the simplest way will be to write and ask\nMrs. Wentworth. I wish I had done so before, but I did not wish to be in\nhaste, and I felt so convinced we should hear from others.\"\n\nGeorgiana agreed that this was the best course to pursue, and Elizabeth,\nhaving told Darcy of her intention, to which, on account of her promise\nto Fitzwilliam, he could no longer object, wrote and dispatched her\nletter.\n\nThe season was now drawing on, and with the shortening days the family\nat Pemberley found themselves thrown more upon the resources of their\nown immediate circle for amusement. The weather was consistently bad,\nand though this did not prevent the gentlemen from covering great\ndistances for the purpose of slaughtering their game, the ladies were of\nnecessity restricted to a smaller area, and their walks seldom extended\nbeyond the park, except when their inclinations led them along a\ntolerably clean road towards the Rectory. This happened pretty\nfrequently, for both Elizabeth and Georgiana were extremely attached to\nElinor Ferrars. Their friendship was of a particularly sincere and\nwell-balanced kind, and was not marred by their constant intercourse, as\neach knew how to maintain that degree of reserve which prevents\nindiscriminate confidences and so greatly strengthens mutual respect.\nKitty was the one who perhaps found the society of the Rectory the least\ncongenial; but it is to be feared that she was extremely difficult to\nplease that autumn, and in the impatience with which she waited for one\nyoung man she might have sometimes regretted the solace which the\ncompany of the other would have afforded.\n\nIn such a small neighbourhood everyone was of some value, and they all\nheard with interest of the approaching visit to Mr. and Mrs. Edward\nFerrars of an old friend, Mrs. Jennings, who was coming early in October\nto spend six or seven weeks with them. Mrs. Ferrars was in delicate\nhealth, and Mrs. Jennings, besides having an almost maternal affection\nfor her, was well qualified to be of service as sick nurse and\nenlivening companion, so that Elinor's warning to Mrs. Darcy that her\nfriend, although the kindest of women, had not always the most refined\nmanner of expressing herself, did not prevent them from being anxious to\nmake her acquaintance.\n\nMrs. Jennings performed in safety the long journey from her son-in-law's\nhouse in Devonshire, and arrived in her customary high spirits. It was\nher first visit to the Ferrars's since their removal from Delaford, and\nshe had to examine the house, to criticize minutely the arrangement of\ntheir furniture, and to compare their surroundings, social and material,\nwith what they had been in their old home. Mrs. Darcy paid an early call\non the new arrival, and the morning after her visit Georgiana and Kitty\nalso found their way to the Rectory.\n\nMrs. Jennings's exuberance, her loud laugh and general noisy\ncheerfulness did not recommend her strongly to either of the girls in\nthe first few minutes, and Georgiana was glad to move to a chair by Mrs.\nFerrars, to enter into a quieter conversation with her; but before\nlong, judging by the sounds which reached them, Mrs. Jennings and Kitty\nhad found some subjects in common. This perhaps was not so surprising,\nas Mrs. Jennings was exceedingly fond of the society of all young girls,\nand cared not at all whether they returned her partiality or no. In this\ncase she had begun, with the utmost frankness, to discourse on the\nsubject nearest her heart at the moment, namely, her dear Mrs. Ferrars,\nand was relating all the circumstances under which their friendship had\nbeen formed, the Dashwood girls' visit to London, the disagreeable\nconduct of Mrs. Ferrars's mother and sister, and the absurd\nmisunderstanding as to Colonel Brandon's attentions, the whole being\npunctuated by frequent bursts of laughter; and she would doubtless have\ngone on to describe in detail the events attending the engagement of her\ntwo young friends, had not Elinor mildly but decisively interposed.\n\n\"Dear madam,\" she said, breaking off in the midst of a remark to\nGeorgiana, \"I am sure Miss Bennet does not wish to hear the history of\nsuch a very dull old couple as ourselves. You are so kind as to be more\ninterested in it than most people could be.\"\n\n\"Lord, my dear,\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"why did you not stop me? I\ndeclare I am very sorry if I said a word I ought not. I know my tongue\ndoes run on, and Miss Bennet must excuse me, for it was only for the\npleasure of talking to you and Mr. Edward. And as for its being dull, I\ndon't believe there is anybody who does not like to hear of other\npeople's love-affairs; it makes one think of one's own, now, does it\nnot, Miss Bennet?\"\n\nKitty blushed and looked embarrassed, and Mrs. Jennings laughed\nheartily, saying: \"It is just as I thought; Miss Bennet could tell us a\npretty tale too, I'll be bound, if only she would.\"\n\n\"Miss Bennet can tell us some wonderful tales of the West Indies,\" said\nElinor, endeavouring to turn Mrs. Jennings's mind from her favourite\ntopic; \"she has a sister there, who writes to her constantly, does she\nnot, Miss Bennet? Those tropical places must be very beautiful. Do you\nremember how Colonel Brandon used to talk to us of his travels in the\nEast, ma'am?\"\n\n\"That I do, my dear,\" replied Mrs. Jennings emphatically, \"and I never\nwant to hear again of such fearful things as he had seen--swamps, and\ngreat things like alligators ... and insects that did everything insects\nought not. I hope you will tell your sister not to get amongst them,\nMiss Bennet.\"\n\nKitty replied that her sister had written chiefly of the beautiful balls\nand illuminations which they frequently had, and lately of some shocks\nof earthquake which had frightened them terribly. Mrs. Jennings\nexclaimed at this, and declared that the finest ball in the world would\nnot compensate her if there was the fear that the ground would open\nunder her feet while she was dancing. \"But I know young people do not\ncare what risks they run,\" said she. \"There was Sir John Middleton three\nweeks ago wanted to have a moonlight picnic; my daughter Middleton was\nall against it, for the weather was so threatening, but have it he\nwould, and the consequence was that they all ate their supper, or as\nmuch of it as they could, in a roaring thunderstorm. I can tell you they\nwere in a pretty pickle when they got back! All the girls so cross, and\nthe young men not a dry thread among them through trying to protect the\nladies. But Sir John, he made no bones about it at all, but said they\nwould go again another night, when for sure it would be fine.\"\n\nHer hearers could not help laughing at such a picture of undaunted\npleasure-seeking, and Elinor inquired if the second party had taken\nplace.\n\n\"Oh, Lord, yes; they all came, but their fathers and mothers made them\npromise not to stir beyond the grounds. I heard, at any rate, they\nturned it into a dance instead. But, as I say, young people don't care\nfor a drop of rain. I am sure, when I was young, I would as lief have\nhad it as not, for there was no hardship in sheltering under a hedge,\nwith the right young man to hold an umbrella over you, do you think so,\nMiss Bennet?\"\n\n\"Still, I fancy that most people, old or young, prefer outdoor\nexpeditions to be in dry weather,\" said Elinor. \"That reminds me that I\nmust show you what terrible havoc last night's rain and wind worked in\nmy flower borders. When I looked out first, I was quite in despair,\nthinking I should not have another nosegay all the autumn. There is a\ngleam of sunshine now, so shall we take a turn in the garden?\"\n\nGeorgiana gladly walked out with her, and Mrs. Jennings and Kitty\nfollowed at a distance, the former questioning her young companion about\nher sister abroad and hearing laments over the gaieties which that\nsister had been able to offer her, but which she had never been able to\naccept. Mrs. Jennings's hearty comments of \"Well, there now, that is a\nshame!\" and \"A regiment too! You would have broken all their hearts, I\nvow!\" and other such remarks pleased Kitty, while she knew in her heart\nthey ought not to do so.\n\nThe two girls shortly after took their leave, and while walking homeward\nnaturally compared notes upon the stranger whom they had just met.\nGeorgiana expressed herself guardedly, not wishing to condemn any friend\nof Mrs. Ferrars's, although feeling as if that friend could not be in\nany way an accession to their party; but Kitty's first unfavorable\nimpression seemed to have been obliterated, and she declared frankly\nthat she liked Mrs. Jennings and thought she was very merry and\ngood-natured. Georgiana could not quite agree with this, for she found\nMrs. Jennings's style of raillery not at all to her mind, but admitted\nthat she might be pleasanter when one got to know her well.\n\nAt dinner these opinions were canvassed, and Georgiana found, as she\nexpected, that her own were largely shared by Elizabeth, who, however,\nwas amused at her severity, and told her that she would often meet\npeople who, with more refined manners, were yet at heart far more vulgar\nthan Mrs. Jennings and had not a tenth part of her redeeming qualities.\n\n\"I do not think I want to meet them, then,\" said Georgiana. \"But I am\nsure you are right, Elizabeth, and I daresay she will be a great comfort\nto Mrs. Ferrars.\"\n\nWhen the ladies were together after dinner, Kitty, whose gravity and\npreoccupation had been noticeable for the last half-hour, after\nwandering several times round the room, stationed herself near to her\nsister and began, in a solemn tone: \"Lizzie, I want to ask you something\nvery important.\"\n\nElizabeth, smiling, professed herself all attention, and Kitty\ncontinued: \"You know you have never kept your promise, that you made\nbefore you were married, of having a ball here, for each winter\nsomething has happened to prevent it.\"\n\n\"Quite true, Kitty; so a ball is in your mind; and what made you think\nof it just now?\"\n\n\"I never come here without thinking of it, but I had somehow not\nexpected to be staying long enough this year, as I imagined I should go\nhome directly after the shooting party. But Mrs. Jennings said to-day\nshe supposed you sometimes had balls in this lovely house, and she was\nsure Georgiana and I were fond of dancing.\"\n\n\"And Mrs. Jennings is quite right about the latter statement, is she\nnot?\"\n\nGeorgiana looked up with a smile, to assent to her share of the\nquestion, and Kitty clasped her hands rapturously, exclaiming: \"Oh,\nLizzie, you know how much I love a ball! It would be so kind of you and\nDarcy! Everyone would enjoy it!\"\n\n\"I am very fond of balls myself,\" said Elizabeth. \"Darcy, as you know,\nis not, but I think even he might admit that it is sometimes a duty to\ngive one. The idea had crossed my own mind, I confess, but I had not\nconsidered whether our party or our numbers would be suitable.\"\n\nKitty's joy at the favourable reception of her proposal was excessive;\nshe could not refrain from beginning to practise her steps about the\nroom, and singing the while from sheer delight, and the gentlemen,\nentering at that moment, paused in astonishment on the threshold.\n\n\"What is this, Kitty?\" inquired Darcy, approaching; \"something Mrs.\nJennings has taught you?\"\n\nExtreme merriment at the idea of Mrs. Jennings as an instructress of\ndancing prevented Kitty from immediately replying, but the whole matter\nwas presently explained and laid before Darcy for approval. Seeing that\nher brother-in-law did not instantly dismiss the whole scheme, Kitty\npoured out a flood of reasons to commend it; it was just the right time\nof year, not too cold and snowy; Jane and Bingley would have a party\nthey could bring over; no ball had been given at Pemberley since\nGeorgiana was grown up; the house was so conveniently built, as if on\npurpose for balls; and finally, it would be a most delightful thing for\neverybody.\n\n\"I know you want time to think it over,\" said Elizabeth to her husband,\n\"and there is no hurry at all; but I think it is quite feasible, and we\nreally owe the neighbourhood some entertainment of the kind.\"\n\nDarcy declared that he did not see why his house should be required to\nfurnish his neighbours with the so-called amusement of watching each\nother promenading about a polished floor, and though no doubt it was a\ngreat compliment to the original architect, he did not believe that\nPemberley had really been primarily designed for giving balls in; but\nhis family could perceive that his opposition was not intended to be\nvery serious, and the discussion terminated with his promising to talk\nit over with Elizabeth, and even to consider the middle of November as\nbeing a date likely to suit the convenience of both households.\n\nKitty regarded the matter as settled, and carried her news to the\nRectory the following morning in the highest spirits, assuring Mrs.\nJennings that it was owing to her suggestion that the subject had been\nbrought forward at the right moment. The sincerity of that lady's\ndelight, and the warmth of her congratulations, were most gratifying,\nand she immediately began to ask Kitty who her partners would be, and\nwhat variety the young men of the neighbourhood could afford.\n\nKitty confessed that there were not many living very near them, with the\nexception of the officers of a regiment stationed at Ashbourne, with\nsome of whom her brother was acquainted, but that her sister, Mrs.\nBingley, would bring over one, or even two, who she knew for certain\ndanced extremely well.\n\n\"Aha!\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"very pretty! And they are single men, too,\nI warrant you.\"\n\nKitty's look of consciousness gave Mrs. Jennings far too fine an\nopportunity to resist, and it did not take her long to ascertain enough\nparticulars about a certain young naval officer to convince her that\nthis ball was going to be the occasion for two young people to be made\nhappy and all their friends regaled with some interesting news. There\nwas no need for her to hear very minute descriptions of Mr. Price's\nconduct and the impressions it had left on the beholders; the mere\nmention of his existence, and a hint of Kitty's partiality, were\nsufficient material upon which to build up a whole romance. Miss Bennet\nmight depend upon it, he was only waiting to come down here and make the\nacquaintance of the rest of her family, and then not a moment would be\nlost.\n\nAlthough these assurances gave her pleasure and revived sensations which\nElizabeth and Georgiana had not wished to encourage, Kitty could not\nhelp feeling a certain absurdity in accepting them from someone whose\nconvictions were based solely on a good-natured interest in the affair,\nand she was tempted into giving a longer version of all that had\nhappened in London, in order that Mrs. Jennings might be more fully\ninformed. It was a decided relief to talk to a friend whose opinions\ncoincided with those of Mrs. Knightley, and as Mrs. Ferrars was not in\nthe room there was nothing to put a check on their confidences. She had,\nhowever, an instinctive feeling of delicacy which made her stop short of\ndivulging a more recent experience, and the unconscious Mr. Morland was\nsaved, had he but known it, many witty sallies on his deserted\ncondition.\n\nElizabeth and Georgiana were amused to notice how willing Kitty\nhenceforward became to go to the Rectory, for whereas she had formerly\nrather endured than enjoyed her visits there, she now volunteered to\njoin the others whenever they went. She was generally to be found,\nduring some part of the time, chatting with Mrs. Jennings; and when the\ngood lady called at Pemberley it was Kitty's office to escort her home\nagain. Mrs. Jennings had early discovered that Miss Darcy was grave and\nquiet, and could on no account be induced to join in any joking\nreferences to lovers, while Mrs. Darcy's general style and manner were\nnot such as to warrant the intimacy implied by such a conversation.\n\nThere were many other topics, for Mrs. Jennings was thoroughly kind and\nfriendly, and took the deepest interest in all her neighbours' concerns\nbesides the sentimental ones: their children, their gardens, their\npoultry, their houses and their clothes. The ball, too, afforded\nunending subjects for discussion. There was to be no disappointment; Mr.\nDarcy had allowed himself to be talked into it, and the fifteenth of\nNovember was fixed for the momentous occasion. Cards were sent out; the\nofficers accepted in a body; Colonel Fitzwilliam promised to stay for\nit; new dresses were ordered from London; and not least among the minor\nexcitements was reckoned the arrival of a letter from Jane, expressing\nthe pleasure of herself and Bingley at the prospect, and engaging to\nbring with them at that time, namely, Miss Bingley, Mr. Price and a Tom\nBertram. This last name was accounted for by Jane's explanation that\nBingley had asked Mr. Price to bring his brother with him, or some other\nman who could shoot, and the brother not being available, Mr. Price had\nsecured instead his cousin, the elder son of Sir Thomas Bertram of\nMansfield Park.\n\nPerhaps not one of the party at the breakfast-table, to whom this letter\nwas read aloud, could hear it altogether unmoved. Elizabeth and her\nhusband were naturally deeply interested in all that concerned Kitty,\nand were glad to know there was a certainty of seeing at last the young\nman of whom they had heard so much; while Georgiana rejoiced in this\nclear proof of his anxiety to meet Kitty again, and built upon it hopes\nof the progress of the affair speedily and uninterruptedly to its\ndesired ending. There need not, surely, be anything to delay it; on the\ncontrary, no young lovers had ever more favourable circumstances, his\nown brief stay on shore an excuse for apparent haste, and Kitty's being\nsurrounded by her friends, whose approval would be equivalent to that of\nher parents, making everything easy. Indeed, it was impossible to see\nwhat obstacles could arise; he could not be diffident enough to\nentertain doubts as to whether his feelings, or what were supposed to be\nhis feelings, were returned. Georgiana could not help a little smile at\nthis thought, though at the same time regretting that Kitty should allow\nher heart to be read so clearly. To Kitty, the announcement of his\nintended arrival at Desborough was scarcely less tremendous than if he\nhad walked into the room himself at that moment, demanding her hand as\nhe approached. The latter incident could hardly have caused her a\ngreater tremor than the former did, and as soon as she could get\nGeorgiana alone she poured out afresh the old hopes, fears and\nanxieties, desiring Georgiana to confirm all her own surmises with\npositive assertions; to reply: \"I am _sure_ he will,\" when Kitty said \"I\n_hope_ he will\"; and to say, \"Of course, most certainly,\" when Kitty\nspeculated upon the various ways in which Mr. Price might be expected to\ncommit himself. Although feeling tolerably confident, Georgiana tried to\nconfine herself to assurances of warm sympathy, and pointed out to\nKitty that it was not prudent or delicate to assume so much when no\nactual declaration had been made, but with Mr. Price's coming so nearly\nin view, this idea detracted from Kitty's perfect satisfaction; she\nprivately found Mrs. Jennings, and her arrangement of the coming events,\nfar more encouraging.\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam's attention was caught by the names of Mrs.\nBingley's guests in rather a different manner. Mr. Price he recollected\nas Georgiana's acquaintance, but the name of Bertram awoke associations\nof a kind which he was trying to subdue. It was the name he had more\nthan once heard coupled with Miss Crawford's; it belonged to the people\nwho were fatally connected with her past life. Had he only the right to\nprotect her, the meeting with this representative of the family might\nhave afforded him an opportunity of refuting for ever the vague scandals\nwhich were doing her so much harm; but he had no right; that privilege\nbelonged to Sir Walter Elliot, and the truest kindness he could do her\nwas to remain silent. In the new life she had chosen all the past should\nbe forgotten. He strove resolutely to put away these saddening\nreflections, and to throw himself into the general interest of the\nsubject by making a few inquiries about the two young men. Georgiana was\nthe only person who could supply any information about Mr. Bertram, for\nMr. Price had told her his sister was married to his cousin, a Mr.\nEdmund Bertram, also of Mansfield. It was evident that this must be the\nolder brother.\n\nFresh excitement was caused shortly afterwards by a second letter from\nMrs. Bingley. Jane wrote that Mr. Price and Mr. Bertram were to arrive\nat Desborough on the sixth of November, and begged that the two girls\nwould come over on the previous day to spend a week there. Mr. Morland,\nshe took care to inform them, was intending to pass the greater part of\nthe month with his friends the Portinscales, and so, as Elizabeth had no\ndoubt already heard, would be unable to be present at the Pemberley\nball. In Kitty, this intelligence aroused the most fleeting of regrets,\nbut the others had leisure to feel sorry, while commending his prudence,\nthat circumstances should prevent his taking part in the general gaiety.\nJane had special reason for feeling kindly towards him, for she had\nwished to ask Kitty to join the party, but had not liked to do so in\nview of Mr. Morland's being at home, but he, suspecting that it would be\nan occasion for inviting some of the relatives from Pemberley, had\nquietly made his arrangements without allowing anyone to perceive the\nhardship it was to him to deny himself a glimpse of Miss Catherine\nBennet.\n\nThe invitation was rapturously accepted on the part of Kitty, and very\nwillingly by Georgiana, for she liked being with Jane, and was pleased\nat the prospect of seeing William again for his own sake. Elizabeth felt\nit most important that the girls should be together, for Georgiana to\nwatch over Kitty and be a check on her impulsiveness; and Darcy gave a\nsign of his confidence in his sister, very precious to her, by saying:\n\"It is a good thing you are asked, Georgiana, for there is no one else\nwho can be trusted to keep Kitty in order and bring us a sensible\naccount of this young man and his intentions.\"\n\nTo Desborough, then, they were to go, and to bear with them Mr. and Mrs.\nDarcy's invitations to Mrs. Bingley's guests for the Pemberley ball.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIV\n\n\nOctober was rapidly passing; and Elizabeth had received no\nacknowledgment of her letter to Mrs. Wentworth. This occasioned her to\nsome surprise, for Anne was a punctilious correspondent, and certainly\nwould not have allowed such an important question as had been put to her\nto remain long unanswered. At last, when Elizabeth had begun to fear\nthat either letter or reply must have miscarried, the wished-for packet\nwas discerned among the morning's post; and she carried it to her own\nprivate room before perusing it.\n\n\"My dear Mrs. Darcy,\n\n\"I do not like to imagine what you must be thinking of me, for my long\nand inexplicable silence. Your letter bears the date October the second,\nalmost a month ago. Will you forgive me when you hear that I only just\nreceived it? We have been travelling abroad, as Frederick wished to take\nadvantage of this period of comparative peace to visit some of the old\nDutch cities, and we returned only this week, after a delightful but\nextremely fatiguing tour. Our letters have followed us about to our\ncontinually changing addresses, and it is little short of a miracle that\nso many of them have reached us. Yours has now reappeared at Winchester\nafter its wanderings! This must be my excuse for not writing instantly\nto correct a misconception under which I grieve to think you have been\nlabouring. My father is not engaged to Miss Crawford, and there is no\nprobability of a marriage between them either now or at some future\ntime. I know that some months ago a rumour to that effect was in\nexistence, for, indeed, it must be confessed that my father's attentions\nto Miss Crawford were very marked, and my sister was among those who\nwere confident that an engagement would ultimately result; but before we\nwent abroad Elizabeth wrote to me from Brighton, where she and my father\nhad removed, to say that the affair was at an end, Miss Crawford having\ngiven my father a definite refusal. I think they were a great deal vexed\nand disappointed, which was perhaps natural, for my father had counted\nupon succeeding, and it would have been a very advantageous match for\nhim; but I cannot help thinking that there would not have been any great\nhappiness in it for either of them. It was not altogether suitable--but,\ndear Mrs. Darcy, I should not weary you with my comments. In such a case\nas this everyone can supply their own. I do not know where Mrs. Grant\nand Miss Crawford are now, but I conclude in Bath. The only news of them\nthat has reached me, besides what I have stated, was, I am sorry to say,\nthat Miss Crawford had been ill, but I heard no particulars. All this\nseems bald and unsatisfactory; I wish I could have given you better and\nearlier information. Pray give our warm regards to Mr. Darcy and his\nsister. It was a great delight to me to renew my acquaintance with the\nlatter, and to see her looking so lovely and blooming. Her countenance\nexpresses so much sensibility, that one is convinced she must have a\ntender heart, and one hopes that life may always be kind to her. I had a\ngreat wish to invite her to pay us a visit when we returned to\nWinchester from London, and was disappointed to learn she had already\ntravelled north. Will you mention it to her, and say how glad we should\nbe if ever she was disposed to come in this direction? We would try to\ngive her a pleasant time. Your children must be reaching a delightful\nage. Alas! with what a pang do I view our empty nursery! Accept my very\ncordial remembrances, and believe me,\" etc.\n\nIt was well that Elizabeth had taken the precaution of being alone to\nread this letter, for the agitation it caused could not easily have been\nconcealed. A thousand confusing thoughts surged through her mind.\nAction, of some sort, she felt she must take, being the only person of\ntheir circle in possession of this knowledge; but what action would be\nsafe, prudent and productive of results? While believing that\nFitzwilliam had been refused, she had always found it hard to credit\nthat he should have been refused for Sir Walter Elliot, and the denial\nof the statement found willing acceptance. It was so unnatural, so\nhorrible, almost, to think of Miss Crawford as Lady Elliot! Before\nElizabeth had even time to think of Fitzwilliam she had rejoiced over\nMiss Crawford's not having committed an act so unworthy of her. She next\ntried to recollect exactly what she had heard with reference to\nFitzwilliam's dismissal. He had been confident that she was lost to him,\nthrough her engagement, he assumed; but since she had never been\nengaged, clearly there had been indications which, as Darcy had said,\nhad forced him to believe that she was ill-disposed towards him. What,\nthen, could anyone do for him now? It was not by any means certain that\nbecause she had rejected Sir Walter Elliot she could be induced to\naccept Colonel Fitzwilliam. And yet the knowledge that she was free,\nfree still to be won, was a reason for not withdrawing utterly until he\nknew what would be the fate of his own pretensions, taken on their own\nmerit. Elizabeth could not feel satisfied, remembering what had happened\nat Bath, that he had ever had a fair opportunity of pleading his cause.\nHe might, indeed, have had a refusal as definite as Sir Walter's, and in\nthat case there would be no kindness in reopening the subject; it would\nprofit him little to know that another suitor had fared no better than\nhimself, even though that suitor might be one who should never have\naspired. But what if it had all arisen through a misunderstanding?\n\nAfter long and earnest consideration Elizabeth determined that whatever\nsteps she now took towards her cousin and the chances of a\nreconciliation, he must know nothing of them; if she had finally decided\nagainst him, there was no reason why he should be put to the pain of\nhearing it a second time. This at least seemed clear, and it paved the\nway for her next resolution, namely to write to Mrs. Grant, without\nmentioning anything she had heard, beyond the intimation of Miss\nCrawford's illness, and ask for news of them both.\n\nDarcy entered while she was preparing to write, and she immediately\nhanded him Mrs. Wentworth's letter. Having read it, he handed it back to\nher, saying gravely: \"What are you going to do now, Elizabeth? for I\nsuppose you are going to do something.\"\n\nElizabeth described her plan and its motives, and Darcy listened without\ngiving her much encouragement. At length he said: \"Have you realized\nwhat a great responsibility you are taking upon yourself in endeavouring\nto bring these two people together again?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Elizabeth, \"and, dear Darcy, do you not think we should be\nprepared to take it? I shall do nothing which could possibly give\nFitzwilliam a moment's uneasiness; he has already suffered too much, and\nis a changed man, as you were agreeing the other day; but if there is\nthe slightest chance of making him happy, I think we ought not to let it\nslip. No one but ourselves can possibly make any attempt to reunite him\nand Miss Crawford.\"\n\n\"I know you are prepared to undertake herculean tasks in the interests\nof your friends, my dear, but when a man has been so decidedly repulsed,\nit is a delicate manner to heal the breach. I imagine your scheme would\nbe straightaway to invite Miss Crawford here, and send them both off for\na walk, with instructions to return in half an hour an engaged couple?\"\n\nThis was spoken without the ghost of a smile, but the idea it suggested\nto Elizabeth was so brilliant that she forgot to remonstrate her husband\nfor not being sufficiently serious. \"I never thought of it, but I will\ndo it!\" she exclaimed. \"Not send them off for a walk, of course, but\ninvite Miss Crawford and her sister to come and stay here. They shall\ncome, if they will, as soon as the ball is over, for Robert is leaving\nthe next day, and in the course of a quiet fortnight it will be strange\nif I cannot discover whether she cares in the least for him.\"\n\n\"And after that time Fitzwilliam is to be summoned home with all speed,\nI suppose?\"\n\n\"Oh, I cannot look so far ahead; if my endeavours prove unavailing, of\ncourse we must not let him know that they have been here at all.\"\n\n\"Well, Elizabeth, I am glad you are providing for all contingencies; and\ndo not forget the most probable one, namely, that they will not be\npersuaded to accept your invitation. Miss Crawford may not want to lend\na helping hand, or Mrs. Grant to play Fitzwilliam's game for him.\"\n\n\"Naturally, I shall tell them distinctly that he will not be here and we\nshall be quite to ourselves. If she has been ill, she may like to have a\nchange. I decline to be discouraged, Darcy, by whatever you may suggest,\nfor I am convinced that this plan can do no harm, and may do a great\ndeal of good.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are right, my dear; it seems to me to be a considerable\nrisk, and we cannot emphasize too strongly the need for absolute\nsecrecy; but you know I cannot wish Fitzwilliam anything better than a\nthoroughly happy marriage, when I think of what mine has done for me.\"\n\n\"Darcy! for you to be paying me compliments! The world must be coming to\nan end. And now here is nurse bringing the children, so I shall have to\npostpone my writing for the present.\"\n\nThe letter was posted, and Elizabeth had to wait longer than she would\nhave wished for an answer to this one also, but after about ten days she\nhad a note in a hand she did not know was brought to her. It proved to\nbe from Mrs. Grant, who dated it from Everingham, Norfolk, and said that\nshe was writing in place of her sister, who was still so far from well\nthat it was necessary to spare her all trouble and fatigue. She had been\nextremely ill during August and September, and had seemed to make so\nlittle progress towards recovery that they had come to stay with their\nbrother a few weeks ago, in the hope of obtaining some benefit from the\nmore bracing air. Unfortunately, she had not gained all the good they\nhad hoped for, and they were still anxious about her. On first receiving\nMrs. Darcy's kind invitation she had felt it was impossible to accept\nit, as her state of health and spirits made her languid and disinclined\nfor exertion, but Mrs. Grant and Mr. Crawford had at length, using all\ntheir powers of persuasion, induced her to reconsider her decision, for\nthey both felt that to mix with her friends once more, and to be in the\nmidst of such agreeable and stimulating surroundings as a visit to Mrs.\nDarcy would afford, would be the best possible remedy for the nervous\ncomplaint from which she had suffered. In any case, they would shortly\nhave to leave Everingham, as it was too cold and exposed a spot, but her\nsister was scarcely equal to the journey to Bath yet, so that Mrs.\nDarcy's letter had come at a most fortunate time.\n\nMiss Crawford was very desirous that Mrs. Grant should explain that she\nwas still an invalid to a great extent--\"and she insists on my saying a\ntiresome and exacting one, though I cannot endorse that,\" added Mrs.\nGrant. \"But she is afraid of giving trouble, and of being, on account of\nher want of health, an unacceptable visitor; and she says that if she is\ngoing to trespass upon your kindness, she cannot do so on false\npretenses, and so wishes you to know just how you will find her, in case\nyou would rather postpone having her until some future time, when she is\nmore of a rational being.\"\n\nElizabeth perceived something of Miss Crawford's old spirit peeping out\nin this message, the spirit of independence, which would laugh at her\nown weakness rather than appeal for pity, and made her reluctant to\naccept a kindness which might wear the aspect of an indulgence. Had it\nnot been for her recent illness, and the consequent pressure put upon\nher by her brother and sister, it was clear she would not have come to\nPemberley; Elizabeth was conscious, in the wording of the letter, of a\nshrinking from it, and the earnest way in which Mrs. Grant, on her\nsister's behalf, begged to be assured that they would find Mr. and Mrs.\nDarcy _quite alone_ at home, emphasized something more than an invalid's\nwish for seclusion.\n\nIn her reply Elizabeth endeavoured to convey a complete assurance of the\nquietness of Pemberley and its suitability for anyone in Miss Crawford's\ndelicate condition. There would be no one at home but themselves, she\nsaid, excepting, of course, Mr. Darcy's sister, whom Miss Crawford had\nmet, and who was one of the household; the patient should have every\ncare, and could lead whatever kind of life she preferred; she should not\nbe troubled in any way, or even be asked to join the rest of the party,\nuntil she felt stronger, as Elizabeth hoped and believed she soon would.\nThe letter was expressive of the writer's goodwill, and she trusted that\nit might do away with any remaining unwillingness that Miss Crawford\nmight have felt in renewing an acquaintance which had indirectly caused\nher so much pain. Elizabeth rejoiced in having accomplished the first\nstep. Miss Crawford's acceptance might have been wrung from her, but it\nwas unlikely she would withdraw it, and once she were safely established\nat Pemberley, whether Colonel Fitzwilliam were to be made happy or not,\nat least there would be no more misunderstandings.\n\nElizabeth proposed a date to Mrs. Grant for the arrival of the two\nladies, but decided to maintain her reserve on the subject towards\neveryone, except her husband, until the ball should be over and her\ncousin should have left the house, for she was particularly anxious that\nno hint of it should reach his ears. Georgiana's discretion could have\nbeen depended upon, but Elizabeth felt it would be better to postpone\ntelling even her of Mrs. Wentworth's reply until matters should be\nfurther advanced.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XV\n\n\nGeorgiana found that her presence as a check on Kitty, and an outlet for\nher excitement, was very necessary, for Kitty had come to regard herself\nas the central figure in the little drama that was to be played during\nthe next few days. Her manner of speaking of Mr. Price during the first\nevening would certainly have betrayed to Miss Bingley the state of her\nfeelings towards him, if that lady had not been already possessed of the\ninformation. Georgiana felt both sorry and vexed, for she could read\nclearly the expression on Miss Bingley's face, and knew that Kitty was\nexposing herself to a not altogether friendly criticism. Miss Bingley\nhad never learnt to do more than tolerate the rest of the Bennet family,\nin spite of her openly professed affection for Jane, and when, as in\nthis case, she happened to have taken a liking to the admirer of one\nmember of it, she evidently found their inferiority greater than ever.\nThat Mr. Price was a great deal too good for Kitty Bennet she managed to\nconvey by looks and tones which were not intended for anyone but Kitty,\nbut which Georgiana could not help but notice and resent. To Georgiana\nherself, Miss Bingley said with a great air of frankness that now this\naffair had been so much talked of, and was expected on all sides, she\ntrusted it would soon become an accomplished fact; of course it was all\nEmma Knightley's doing, but as Kitty was evidently so much in love, she\n_hoped_ (with a good deal of emphasis) that Mr. Price felt the same.\n\nThe great day arrived, and Mr. Tom Bertram's curricle drove up to the\ndoor late in the afternoon, laden with its two passengers and a\nmanservant, and all the necessary complement of bags, gun-cases and a\nspaniel on a chain. William Price had been staying at Mansfield, and\nconsequently the journey for both was a comparatively easy one. There\nwere many greetings to be made, and introductions to be performed, in\nthe short half-hour before everyone retired to dress for dinner.\nBingley, in the warmth of his welcome, could not make enough of his\nguests, and wanted to be talking to them both at once; but the look of\ndelighted surprise on William Price's face when he caught sight of the\ntwo young girls did not escape observation, any more than the remarkable\nfact of Kitty's being suddenly struck almost dumb with shyness, and\nbeing unable to reply except in monosyllables, and with deep blushes, to\nhis inquiries after her health. Georgiana, with greater self-possession,\nshook hands in her own grave manner, looked him straight in the face,\nanswered him simply, and bowed with quiet courtesy in acknowledgment of\nthe pleasure he expressed in meeting them again.\n\nAt dinner, Kitty was placed between Georgiana and Mr. Price, the latter\nbeing on Mrs. Bingley's right hand; and as Jane considerately talked for\nmost of the time to Mr. Tom Bertram, who sat on her other side, Kitty\nwas able to enjoy Mr. Price's conversation almost uninterruptedly. He\nhad much to tell, and she to ask, of London and their mutual friends\nthere, of his stay in Portsmouth and the King's visit to review the\nships, of the shooting parties at Mansfield and the astonishing sagacity\nof his cousin's new dog. Georgiana heard scraps of it, and noticed with\nsatisfaction the good understanding that seemed to exist. \"It is much\nthe wisest beginning,\" she thought. \"Far better to have a basis of\ncommon interests on which to found a friendship before love comes, than\nto rush blindly into a violent attachment, which may as rapidly subside.\nMr. Price will gradually bring out the best that is in Kitty. He will\ncare for the same things she does, but more moderately; and he will\ndevelop her finer taste. She will have so much to make her happy that\nher charm of nature will not fade.\"\n\nMr. Price was evidently too sensible to expect to have the exclusive\nenjoyment of Kitty's company in such a small party. He was ready to\nreply to anyone who might address him, seemed to wish to get acquainted\nwith Mrs. Bingley, and always had a lively word or glance for his cousin\nopposite. Tom Bertram would put up with a greater amount of good-natured\nteasing and joking from his cousin than he had ever done from anyone in\nhis life; but his illness had sobered him, and though not much less\ncareless and selfish than formerly, he entertained a secret admiration\nfor the younger man, who had already done so much with his own life, and\nhe had shown himself strongly amenable to influence from that quarter.\nTo exercise an influence was the last thing William Price would have\nthought of doing; and yet it was entirely through his half-laughing,\nhalf-serious representations that Tom had been induced to settle down at\nhome, to interest himself in the work of managing the estate, and to\nshow more consideration for his parents. At the moment, he had allowed\nhimself to be carried off from home, knowing that it was part of a\ngeneral scheme to distract his mind from a matrimonial entanglement in\nwhich he was on the verge of becoming involved, and which his family\ncordially disliked; but there was reason to fear that Miss Isabella\nThorpe had played her cards too well, and that in spite of the efforts\nof friends she would eventually reign at Mansfield Park as the next Lady\nBertram.\n\nWhen the gentlemen rejoined the ladies after dinner, William Price\nimmediately approached Georgiana, and made a few remarks upon\nindifferent subjects, until the attention of the others being directed\nto a story narrated by Mr. Bertram, he inquired if she had heard\nanything more of Miss Crawford since their last meeting.\n\nOwing to Elizabeth's reticence on the subject, Georgiana was able to\nanswer, with truth, that she had heard nothing. When she had spoken, her\nreply seemed to her so curt that she added: \"My sister, Mrs. Darcy, has\nwritten to a friend--to Mrs. Wentworth, in fact, to make inquiries, but\nI do not know with what result.\"\n\n\"To Mrs. Wentworth?\" repeated William Price. \"Then, of course, that\nmeans you know what I was so churlish as to refuse to tell you, that\nevening at Mrs. Hurst's--Sir Walter Elliot's name. I hope you have\nforgiven me, Miss Darcy, and will understand why I did not feel at\nliberty to repeat it at that time.\"\n\n\"I am sure you were right, Mr. Price, and indeed we have never heard the\nrumour confirmed yet,\" said Georgiana. \"I wish I had seen Miss Crawford\nagain, but there was no opportunity.\"\n\n\"I did not see her again, either,\" said William. \"I had to leave town\ndirectly after, and when I returned they were gone. I wish I could learn\nsomething! I so trust it may not be true; for Miss Crawford to marry\nthat man would be not one, but a thousand pities. It is difficult to\nunderstand why anyone should make a so-called marriage of convenience;\nbut one feels that she of all people is worthy of a better fate.\"\n\n\"One must hope, if it really is decided upon, that it is not altogether\na mere convenience; that that there is some mutual regard also,\" said\nGeorgiana.\n\n\"Oh, no doubt, there is a great deal of regard on _his_ side, but he is\nnot the sort of man to appreciate her properly,\" rejoined Mr. Price. \"If\nyou knew him, Miss Darcy, even your kindness of heart would fail to find\nsuitable excuses.\"\n\n\"I know Miss Crawford's friends are dissatisfied about it,\" said\nGeorgiana; \"but I cannot help feeling that there is no need for her to\nmake any marriage at all unless she is confident it will conduce to her\nhappiness, so that, whatever she is doing, one must assume that she is\nusing her judgment.\"\n\n\"You put the case so admirably, Miss Darcy, that I declare you have\nnearly consoled me. It is just what I have tried to remind myself of,\nthat she can afford to marry where she chooses, and as there is no\ncompulsion except her own good nature, I can hardly believe she will\nmake such an unwise choice. That absolutely settles it; I believe you\nhave got private information, which you have conveyed to me from your\nown mind without speaking a word, and which has reassured me.\"\n\n\"No, indeed, I have no private information,\" replied Georgiana with a\nfaint smile, \"and I think you have reassured yourself by your own close\nknowledge of Miss Crawford's character.\"\n\n\"I may know Miss Crawford better, but in matters of this kind women are\nfar better judges of one another than are men of them. You read each\nother as you would yourselves, and deduce each other's motives from your\nknowledge of your own; consequently, you bring a far keener insight to\nbear than we can.\"\n\n\"I think that perhaps women understand each other better, and it is\nnatural that they should,\" said Georgiana, after a moment's reflection.\n\"But then you must remember that they are expected to acquire the habit\nof entering into the feelings of others. Their position as onlookers in\nthe active world enables them to find their pleasure in studying the\ncharacters of those around them, and their happiness is in proportion to\nthe amount of sympathy and comprehension which is excited in\nthemselves.\"\n\n\"That is too modest an estimation of the qualities of your sex, Miss\nDarcy. I should go further, and say that some persons do not need to\nacquire the habit you mention, for they have naturally such quick and\ngenerous sympathies, such a power of reading with true kindliness the\ndispositions of others, and drawing out the best that is in them, that I\nthink it is impossible for them to receive more happiness than they\ngive. You must have met some such; and that is what I mean by a woman's\npower of insight.\"\n\nHe looked at her earnestly as he said this, and Georgiana had never seen\nhim so grave. That he meant Kitty, she had not a moment's doubt; and\nthey seemed to be within half a sentence of her name. She fully expected\nhis next words to be: \"There is someone we both know, I think, Miss\nDarcy,\" or something similar, and in her confusion, she did not stop to\nreflect how unlikely it was that he would speak so openly when Kitty was\nstanding a few yards away. But as he continued to look at her without\nsaying anything further, she strove to interrupt a pause which\nthreatened to become embarrassing, and murmured, not very collectedly:\n\"Yes, indeed it is so. My brother's wife, Mrs. Darcy,\" she added, not\ndaring to show her thoughts were following the same direction as his,\n\"is one of those you were describing. She understands everyone so well;\nshe knows what one would say even when one has the greatest difficulty\nin expressing it. I think she is the cleverest person I have ever met.\"\n\nShe thought he looked a little disappointed at her change of theme, but\nhe bowed, and said courteously that he had a great wish to meet Mrs.\nDarcy. Georgiana caught at this remark as a means of extricating himself\nfrom a conversation which was almost too interesting to be pursued just\nthen. \"I hope very much that you will meet her,\" she said. \"I do not\nknow if Mr. Bingley has mentioned it, but there is to be a ball at\nPemberley next week, and my sister hoped Mr. and Mrs. Bingley would\nbring you all over with them.\"\n\nWilliam's face displayed the pleasure he felt, before he could give\nutterance to it, and Georgiana, recollecting that she had not intended\nto give the invitation, but to leave to Kitty the gratification of doing\nso, turned round impulsively and called to her friend, who was standing\nclose by Jane's chair on the opposite side of the fireplace, but casting\nmany wistful glances towards Georgiana and her companion.\n\n\"Kitty, I have been telling Mr. Price about the ball,\" said Georgiana,\nas Kitty darted towards them; \"that is, that we hope he is coming to it;\nbut you must tell him what an achievement it is to have persuaded\nElizabeth and my brother. We owe it entirely to your suggestion that\nthere is going to be any ball.\"\n\n\"Oh, Georgiana, why did you tell Mr. Price? I was keeping it for a great\nsurprise,\" exclaimed Kitty reproachfully; and turning to William, she\ndemanded his approval for the scheme, the details of which were quickly\nexpounded. William gave a proper meed of praise and admiration, and\nGeorgiana presently slipped away to join the others, who were preparing\nto sit down to a round game; but William and Kitty remained talking\ntogether until tea was brought in.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVI\n\n\nThe following day the sportsmen went out early and returned late, and as\nsome friends from the neighbourhood were dining at Desborough, there was\nno opportunity for much conversation between the young ladies and Mr.\nBingley's guests. Kitty passed their chief of the day in writing a long\nletter to Mrs. Knightley, and Georgiana was taken possession of by Miss\nBingley, who wished to practice vocal and instrumental duets. Miss\nBingley had a good deal to say, during the intervals of their\nperformance, about Mr. Price, whom she acknowledged she liked very much,\nand she endeavoured to prove to Georgiana, by a number of arguments, the\nimprobability of his having any matrimonial intentions in general, and\ntowards Kitty in particular. Georgiana would not discuss the point with\nher. Her own esteem for Mr. Price depended on his not disappointing\nKitty, and she would admit no suspicion which might imperil it.\n\nOn the third afternoon, the shooting party having returned earlier on\naccount of bad weather, they were all assembled in the library. Bingley\nwas showing Mr. Bertram some hunting prints that hung on the walls, and\nthe rest were gathered round the fire, the ladies sitting, and William\nPrice leaning on the overmantel glancing at the pieces of porcelain and\nthe miniatures arranged upon it.\n\n\"What beautiful little Chinese figures these are, Mrs. Bingley,\" he\nsuddenly exclaimed. \"They are genuinely old, are they not? A man I know\nbrought back just such a pair from Hong Kong, and I know he regarded\nthem as priceless. I do not think they can be imitated in Europe.\"\n\n\"Yes, I believe they are really old,\" replied Mrs. Bingley. \"I do not\nknow the history of them, but they have been in Mr. Bingley's family for\na long time, and they are special favourites of his; perhaps you can\ntell us, Caroline?\"\n\nMiss Bingley was beginning to speak when she was interrupted by a cry of\ndismay from Mr. Price. He had taken the little figure in his hand to\nexamine it more closely, and the head had immediately fallen off and\nrolled on the hearth. Fortunately a thick rug had received it, and after\na search it was discovered intact; but Mr. Price was overwhelmed with\nself-reproach for his carelessness, until stopped by Mrs. Bingley\nsaying: \"You need not mind, Mr. Price, for it was not in the least your\nfault. The head was broken off already. Look, it has been slung between\nthe shoulders by a piece of wire. I should have mended it, but could not\nmanage to attach a new length of wire.\"\n\n\"I am relieved to find I am not the guilty party,\" said Mr. Price; \"that\nis, if you are quite sure, Mrs. Bingley.\"\n\n\"Indeed I am; and Kitty,\" she added, turning toward her sister, \"perhaps\nyou can help me to clear Mr. Price's character. Do you happen to know\nanything about the breaking of this little mandarin? We found it so a\nfew days after you left, and no one in the house could account for it.\nI have always meant to ask you about it, but had forgotten until now.\"\n\nOwing to the comparative dimness of the firelight, Jane was unable to\nperceive her sister's growing confusion; but it became evident in the\nembarrassed pause which followed her question. Kitty began to speak,\nbroke off, and began again, stumbling over her words: \"I had thought it\nhad been broken--that is, I knew it had--but something put it out of my\nhead--I forgot it too till now.\"\n\n\"What a pity you did not mention it,\" said Miss Bingley severely; \"it\nmight have been worse injured next time it was touched by anyone not\nknowing the head was loose.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, never mind, dear Kitty,\" said Jane kindly; \"it does not\nmatter; it can easily be repaired, no doubt.\"\n\nKitty, on the verge of tears, looked distressfully from one to the\nother, torn between her dislike to recalling the occasion, and her\ndesire to exonerate herself in the eyes of William Price. The latter\nconsideration prevailed, and addressing Jane, she murmured with deepest\nblushes; \"It was not I who broke it, it was Mr. Morland.\"\n\n\"Mr. Morland!\" repeated Jane, perplexed. \"Yes, it was that last morning\nhe was here. We--he was in the library, you know. He had the Chinese\nfigure in his hand, and I recollect noticing it was in two pieces. I\nnever thought of it again until now, and I suppose he forgot it too.\"\n\nKitty's self-consciousness, increased as it was by the knowledge that\nJane and Georgiana would now perfectly understand the reason for the\ndisaster which had befallen the porcelain ornament, quite mystified her\nother two hearers, to whom the explanation taken by itself would have\nbeen sufficiently simple. All they could plainly perceive was that the\nassociation of Mr. Morland with the incident made Kitty extremely\nuncomfortable, and they were left to draw what conclusions they might by\nher hasty departure from the room. William Price, with a delicacy of\nfeeling for which Georgiana's heart went out to him, immediately filled\nup the moment of awkwardness by reverting to the original subject of\ntheir discussion, which he still held in his hand. \"At any rate,\" he\nsaid, smiling, \"I have helped to decapitate this poor mandarin, so it\nseems only fair that I should try to mend him. Have I your permission,\nMrs. Bingley? I believe, with a fresh bit of wire and some sealing-wax,\nI could make him nod as benevolently as ever.\"\n\nBingley was called upon to produce the necessary articles, and being\nwarned by a glance from his wife not to pursue his inquiry as to whether\nthey had discovered who had damaged the old fellow, the incident seemed\nlikely to arouse no further remark. Georgiana evaded Miss Bingley's\neyes, and went away as soon as she could to Kitty's room, finding her\nfriend lying upon the bed and weeping bitterly.\n\n\"Georgiana, what must he have thought?\" she began instantly, throwing\nherself into her friend's arms. \"Why did Jane ask me that unfortunate\nquestion, just at that time? It could not have happened worse. I was\nthinking about it a little, because, you know, I had not been in that\nroom since Mr. Morland and I were there together. We were standing in\njust the same place as we were all in to-night, and it made me quite\nmiserable to remember it. And now Mr. Price will not know what to think,\nhearing Mr. Morland's name like that. He will suspect something, and\nperhaps it will prevent him from speaking. I wish we were back at\nPemberley; I knew things would never go so well here again.\"\n\nGeorgiana comforted her, assured her that what had happened would never\nmake the slightest difference to Mr. Price, laughingly reproached her\nwith having run away, saying that no one would have perceived anything\nout of the ordinary but for that, and counselled her to behave just as\nusual when she met the others again, and everything would be forgotten.\nNevertheless, Kitty was far from comfortable during the rest of their\nstay, and was in continual expectation of some occurrence which might\naffect Mr. Price's attitude towards her, although the cheerful\nfriendliness of his manner never varied.\n\nThis apprehension rendered her particularly uneasy the following day,\nwhich was Sunday. They all went to church, where the service was read by\na stranger, and Kitty's sensibility was sorely tried by having to listen\nto various questions asked by their visitors during the walk back. Was\nthat the regular clergyman? He was absent; ah, indeed! Was he a pleasant\nneighbour? a good preacher? And so that was the Rectory; what a\ncommodious, attractive-looking house! No doubt the parson was a married\nman, and he was certainly a lucky fellow to be so circumstanced,\ncommented Mr. Bertram. Bingley made brief answers out of compassion for\nKitty, and Jane began a conversation with the two girls about something\ndifferent; but she could not attend. It was so distressing to think of\nMr. Morland, whom Bingley praised so highly and whom the others thought\nso enviable, having been driven away from home on her account; that a\nman so charming and so desirable should have fallen in love with her\nwhen she was not able to care for him. There seemed something\nparticularly unfortunate, particularly wasteful, about the whole affair!\nIf he had been a Mr. Collins, that nobody, not even Maria Lucas, would\nhave minded refusing! Poor Kitty walked home silently, and as far from\nMr. Price as possible, with her muff held up to conceal a countenance\nwhich she knew was unfit to be seen.\n\nOn Monday, Bingley and Mr. Bertram went out hunting, and the ladies,\nescorted by Mr. Price, drove to the spot where the foxhounds were to\nmeet, in the hope of seeing a little sport. Bingley had offered to mount\nMr. Price also, but the latter had declined, laughingly declaring that,\nlike all sailors, he was not much of a horseman, and though he had once\nhunted from Mansfield Park when he was a careless youngster, he thought\nit would be wiser not to venture over the Derbyshire country, with its\nrough moors and high stone walls, on a borrowed horse. \"It is most kind\nof you, Mr. Bingley,\" he said; \"and for my cousin, it is all right, for\nhe has hunted here before. But I am sure you would not be pleased, if\nyou saw me come crashing down at the first big fence, with your\nhundred-guinea hunter doubled up in the further ditch.\"\n\nThe ladies held up hands of horror, but Bingley, much amused, said he\nwould not believe a word of it, and that he felt sure Mr. Price could\nride as well as he could shoot. William shook his head.\n\n\"I have ridden all sorts of horses at different times, when occasion has\nrequired it, and have even managed to adhere to the animal as a rule;\nbut my good luck might desert me to-day. Perhaps you will let me go for\na jogging ride along the lanes before I go, on your least valuable\nhorse.\"\n\n\"Seeing that I am in charge of you just now, William, I highly applaud\nyour decision,\" said his cousin, \"as I don't want to have to send you\nback to Portsmouth with a broken neck, which is certainly what could\nhappen.\"\n\n\"You in charge of me! I like that,\" exclaimed William. \"Say much more,\nand I will borrow a gypsy's donkey and come to meet you on it,\nannouncing to everybody that I am bringing along your second mount.\"\n\nMrs. Bingley was a little afraid of the cold wind, and decided not to\ngo, so Mr. Price took his seat in the barouche with the other three, and\ngreatly enhanced the gaiety of their party. They drove about for more\nthan two hours, and when at last, the hunt having gone away among the\nhills, they decided to turn homewards, Mr. Price created consternation\namong his fair companions by asking permission to get out and walk.\n\n\"Walk, Mr. Price?\" exclaimed Miss Bingley, who, placed on the front\nseat, had assumed the direction of the party. \"Why should you want to\nwalk? And in this desolate wilderness! Why, we must be six or seven\nmiles from home.\"\n\n\"Yes, I thought it was about that,\" said William \"I rather wanted a\nwalk, and do you know, I like this desolate wilderness, as you call it.\nI should enjoy exploring my way homewards, and I have noted all the\nlandmarks. It is so cold, too; a splendid day for a walk.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Price, do not go; we are all so snugly tucked in here,\" said\nKitty imploringly.\n\n\"Oh, if you prefer walking, pray do not let us detain you,\" said Miss\nBingley, speaking at the same moment, and in rather an offended voice.\n\nWilliam looked in surprise from one to the other; it had evidently not\noccurred to him for one moment that he would be missed by any of them.\nUnconsciously, his eye sought Georgiana's, and she said quickly: \"Mr.\nPrice must be cold with sitting still so long; I expect he would enjoy a\nwalk. It really is not so far; from the top of the hill one can see\nKympton Church, I know, and on foot one can take an almost straight\nroute.\"\n\nThe carriage had stopped and the servants awaited their orders. William\nremained irresolute; he had one lady's leave to go, another was doing\nher best to appear indifferent, and the third plied him with entreaties\nnot to break up their comfortable little party. Georgiana was amused,\nbut also a little ashamed to see Caroline and Kitty, for once united in\nthe object of their wishes, showing those wishes so plainly. It was\nclear that William Price felt the awkwardness thus created, for his\nhesitation only lasted a second or two, and he said lightly: \"Why, of\ncourse, I will not get out, if it would be disturbing anybody. Probably\nthe negotiation of those short cuts would make me very late for dinner.\nShall they drive on?\"\n\nMiss Bingley gave the order in a dignified tone, and assured him that he\nhad done wisely to desist, for he certainly would have been late.\nGeorgiana could not help remarking that it was a pity he should have\nmissed his walk, for the others would not be in before five; but he gave\nher a glance and a half smile, which showed her that he was not allowing\nit to trouble him. Kitty, delighted that Mr. Price had given this proof\nof a wish to please him, talked all the way home, and described with\ngreat animation several _dreadful_ walks that Bingley had taken her on\nthe moors, when, according to her account, they had narrowly escaped\ndeath on many occasions--wild cattle, dangerous bogs, rushing torrents\nand venomous snakes being among the risks to be encountered on such\nexpeditions.\n\nMr. Price listened with interest, but his courage did not appear to be\nshaken, for as soon as they descended from the carriage, he paused only\nto glance at the clock, and to divest himself of his heavy coat, before\nasking Miss Darcy if she would accompany him on a walk. \"It will be as\nshort as, or as long, as brisk or as leisurely, as you are disposed\nfor,\" he said, and Georgiana declined with real regret.\n\n\"I should have enjoyed it very much, Mr. Price, but I think I had better\nnot; it is rather late, and the others may be wanting me before dinner.\nBesides,\" she added, as she saw his disappointed look, \"I know you want\na good walk, and you can go further if you have not to adapt yourself to\nthe slow paces of a lady.\"\n\n\"I should esteem it an honour to have to adapt myself to yours,\" replied\nWilliam Price, with the quick, bright smile which was so noticeable in\nhim.\n\n\"We must all go together to-morrow morning,\" said Georgiana, as she\nturned away. \"Mr. Bingley can show us what is the best direction. I hope\nit will keep fine, but it looks very like snow.\"\n\nMr. Price did not move from where he stood for some minutes, and\nGeorgiana, as she ascended the stairs, felt strongly to return and\naccede to his suggestion, but the fear that Kitty would not like it\nwithheld her. She wished that he had asked Kitty instead, or as well,\nfor although anyone might well have assumed--after the descriptions she\nhad given--that a country walk, for its own sake, was to her the most\nuncongenial form of amusement, yet Georgiana knew well that it would be\nviewed in a very different light were a particular companion available.\n\nThe promised walk did not take place, for the snow, which had been\nthreatening, fell the following day, not thickly, but with enough of fog\nand dampness in the atmosphere to make the fireside seem by far the most\nagreeable place. The gentlemen shot in the first part of the morning,\nbut returned home soon after one, ready for any entertainment that they\nmight be expected to provide or be provided with; and Tom Bertram's\ninclinations, as usual, were in favour of the former. Not being a\ncard-player, or enthusiast for music, and having found Mr. Bingley to be\nat billiards an adversary unworthy of his skill, he was obliged to seek\nsome other method of spending a winter's afternoon, and without\nhesitation he broached to the assembled party his idea that they should\nact some charades.\n\nMrs. Bingley looked doubtful, and William Price gave his cousin no\nsupport; but the notion was warmly taken up by Bingley, his sister and\nsister-in-law, and Mr. Bertram set himself to persuade Mrs. Bingley\nthat, next to a real play, charades were the most delightful things\nimaginable, and that they had a party collected about them remarkably\nwell qualified to undertake any and every kind of character.\n\nHis hostess proved not difficult to persuade when she perceived what\npleasurable anticipations were aroused by the suggestion; and only\nneeded to be assured by her husband that it was a capital notion, and\nthe young people would thoroughly enjoy it, to promise help of whatever\nkind was needed. William Price was ready to enter into it, when it\nbecame evident that it was the general wish; and even Georgiana began to\nbe interested, and concealed her nervousness at the idea of taking part.\n\n\"You need not be frightened, Georgiana,\" said Miss Bingley; \"all you\nwill be required to do is to stand perfectly still and assume a\nparticular expression. Louisa and I have often taken part in them; there\nis no acting, it is all the pose.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Miss Bingley,\" interposed Mr. Bertram, \"the kind of charades\nI propose we should do involves a certain amount of movement--acting,\nin short; and others require impromptu speeches. I recollect once, at\nthe house of my friend--\"\n\n\"I am sure you are mistaken, Mr. Bertram; the correct charade is not\nacting at all; it is simply a series of pictures, or tableaux, to\nrepresent the various syllables.\"\n\nThe discussion threatened to become keen, especially when the two\nyounger girls joined in protesting that they could not possibly recite\nany impromptu speeches; but Bingley finally settled the point by\nagreeing with Mr. Bertram's vehement assertion that it would be much\nmore amusing if they acted their parts, and that he could show them how\nto do it in such a way that no speaking would be necessary, though Miss\nBingley doubted if _all_ the company would be equal to such a demand\nupon their capabilities.\n\nThe next point was to choose the words, a matter of prodigious\nimportance, for which many books were brought out and consulted, and the\nmerits and possibilities of each word exhaustively debated. It was not\nuntil they renewed the consideration of the subject at the dinner-table\nthat they made the discovery that if all of them were to appear in\ndifferent scenes of the same charade, there would be no one left to\nguess the meaning.\n\n\"This becomes really serious,\" said Bingley. \"If it was a play, we could\nact to ourselves, and the chairs and tables, and be perfectly happy; but\nthe very existence of a charade is threatened if no one is ignorant of\nit. And from what I hear of intended costumes, it will take the rest of\nthe evening for our preparations, so that we shall be ready to begin the\nperformance just as our ladies have to leave us to-morrow.\"\n\n\"But who is leaving to-morrow? Not Miss Bennet and Miss Darcy?\"\nexclaimed Tom Bertram in real alarm. \"This cannot be allowed. Pray, Mr.\nBingley, use your authority. I am sure they could remain another day.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I am sure we could,\" cried Kitty; \"they could not wish us to\nmiss the charades--it would spoil everything if we could not be here.\"\n\nBingley looked at Georgiana and asked her, smiling, if she thought it\ncould be managed, but she had already given an imploring, though\nunheeded, glance towards Kitty, and now replied, in a low voice: \"It is\nvery kind of you, but we ought not to stay, I am sure. The carriage will\nbe coming for us, and we ought not to detain it for a whole day.\"\n\n\"What does it matter, Georgiana,\" Kitty exclaimed, \"only for one day!\nElizabeth will not mind. Don't you care about the charades, and about\nputting a stop to the whole thing? We can easily be spared, if that is\nwhat you are thinking; the ball is not until Friday.\"\n\nGeorgiana, blushing, and distressed by finding herself the object of\nattack, was endeavouring to maintain her ground without giving offence,\nwhen Jane came to her assistance.\n\n\"Georgiana is perfectly in the right,\" she said, \"and sorry though I am\nto lose them both, there is no doubt that they will be expected back\nto-morrow without fail. But that is no reason why the charades need be\ngiven up, for as we shall all be coming over to Pemberley on the\nfollowing day, we can give them there that evening, if my sister and Mr.\nDarcy will consent to be audience, and our performance to-night will\nserve as a kind of rehearsal.\"\n\nThis suggestion was enthusiastically received, as it met all\ndifficulties, and Kitty forgot to reprove Georgiana for hurrying her\naway, in the contemplation of the news with which they would return\nhome, and the delightful bustle of preparation that would ensue. Jane\nand Bingley had not quite the same views, and they spoke privately to\nGeorgiana before she left, asking her to take a message begging\nElizabeth and Darcy not to put themselves to any trouble about the\narrangements for the stage, which need only be of the very simplest\nnature, a sufficiency screen and lamps being all that would be asked\nfor.\n\nThe rehearsal proceeded in admirable style. Mr. Bertram had constituted\nhimself stage-manager, and gave everyone minute instructions as to their\nmovements and attitudes, shouted directions from the midst of an\nimaginary audience, and hastened at the last moment to take his place in\nthe scenes where he was required to be actor as well. With some\nassistance from Mr. Bingley, he had allotted the various parts, and as\nhe was so fortunate as to be able to regard all four ladies from an\nabsolutely impartial standpoint, his judgments were, on the whole,\ntolerably good; although the usual difficulties of such an occasion\narose, and had to be smoothed away, as, for instance, when Mrs. Bingley\npositively declined to play a part which required any acting, although\nshe was the only person who looked the Queen to perfection; or when Miss\nDarcy wanted to give up an important part to Miss Bennet, whom it did\nnot suit at all, simply because the latter was anxious to wear the dress\nthat went with it; or when Miss Bingley desired to represent both Lady\nMacbeth and Joan of Arc, and could not be made to understand that she\ncould take only one, on account of the necessity for passing quickly\nfrom one scene to another. All, however, was amicably arranged before\nthe evening ended, and when the others went to bed, Tom Bertram sat up,\ndesperately writing lists of the properties and accessories which he\ndeemed necessary to the performance.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVII\n\n\nKitty was partly consoled for the agony of quitting Desborough Park by\nthe prospect of a reunion of the family under such enticing\ncircumstances, and Georgiana was sensible of the advantage of having two\nor more evenings of excitement to prepare for and look forward to, to\nsustain Kitty's spirits, which might otherwise have suffered some\ndiminution of liveliness in consequence of Mr. Price's not having made\nhis offer before they left. Kitty talked of it, and of him, and of the\ncharades, incessantly and inextricably all the way home; and it was\nfortunate that Elizabeth was alone when they arrived, for it was hardly\npossible for Kitty to disentangle the three subjects in giving a\ndescription of their visit. Elizabeth made her happy by a kindly\nreception of the plan for the following evening, and a promise to invite\nthe Ferrars and Mrs. Jennings to witness the charades; and when she had\ndarted away to the nursery with some presents sent by Jane to the little\nDarcys, Elizabeth smilingly asked Georgiana if, from her own\nobservation, she could confirm Kitty's eager anticipations. Georgiana\ncould only reply that she believed all was going well; that Mr. Price\nwas more charming than ever, and the only difficulty in the way of\nforming a judgment was that he was equally charming to everyone.\n\n\"I suppose Kitty's preference for him was very clearly marked?\" said\nElizabeth.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Georgiana, \"I am rather afraid it was; but he appeared to\naccept it without any embarrassment, and the understanding between them\nseemed so good that I do not think there _can_ be any fear of his\ndisappointing her; we were almost always all together at Desborough, and\nI used to think he was only awaiting an opportunity of seeing her\nalone.\"\n\n\"Or she used to think so, perhaps?\" said Elizabeth. \"Well, I trust it is\ngoing to end satisfactorily; meantime, I am most anxious to see this\nparagon, with whom Jane, for her letter, seems to be nearly as much\ndelighted as you and Kitty are.\"\n\nKitty was allowed to be the bearer of the note, conveying the\ninvitation, to the Rectory party the next morning; and while Mrs.\nFerrars was writing a reply in another room, the enthusiastic young lady\nwas able to pour out her heart to the equally enthusiastic old lady.\nMrs. Jennings received her with much warmth, and immediately began a\nseries of questions which she usually answered herself at the same time\nthat Kitty was giving a reply, so that the real and the imaginary\ndescriptions were inseparably mingled together.\n\n\"And how was the young officer, my dear? Ay, ay, you need not tell me:\nas handsome and as attentive as ever, I can see by your eyes.\"\n\n\"Yes, just as handsome as ever, dear Mrs. Jennings, and\nattentive--yes--but you see we were a small party, so he could not\ndevote himself entirely--\"\n\n\"Ah, but I fancy he _did_--did he not now? You need not be so modest\nabout it; these small parties are the very thing for the right people\nalways to pair off together. Lord! how well I remember when Mr. Palmer\nwas courting Charlotte, and there was a young man, too, coming after my\nniece, and my sister used to say: 'It won't be a match this time,\nSarah,' and I'd say, 'You wait and see Henrietta; each of the girls has\ngot her beau, and there's a room for each to sit in; and the weather's\nvery bad;' and sure enough, the very next Monday--did you not say you\nhad bad weather, too, my dear?\"\n\n\"I did not say so, Mrs. Jennings, but we did have some rain and snow.\"\n\n\"I thought as much; well, well, you are a lucky girl, to have it all\nyour own way, and your friends liking him so much, too; I suppose he\nwill speak to Mr. Darcy when he comes over here, as your father is not\njust at hand.\"\n\n\"Dear Mrs. Jennings, you are making too much of it; he has not spoken to\nme yet, you know: it is only that we are good friends, and he seems to\nenjoy talking to me, and Jane was so kind, and let us sit together.\"\n\n\"That is quite right, my dear, just as it should be; I'll warrant your\nsister Jane is a very sensible woman; and these charades, too, just the\nthing. There, I am downright pleased to think I shall see the finish of\nit. This acting, I suppose was the young man's idea? he is a clever one,\nI know.\"\n\n\"No, it was not his; though, of course, he does it better than anyone\nelse. It was Mr. Bertram's idea--his cousin, who came with him.\"\n\n\"His cousin! Ah, yes, the other young man, I recollect. He was invited\nfor Miss Darcy, wasn't he? Come, come, now, Miss Bennet, no secrets\namong friends.\"\n\n\"There is no secret, ma'am,\" returned Kitty, laughing, \"I do not think\nhe was invited for Miss Darcy, or anyone; my sister did not know him\nbefore.\"\n\n\"You may be sure that was in her mind. Is he not heir to some great\nproperty? It seems to me I have heard so.\"\n\n\"He is heir to his father, Sir Thomas Bertram, in Northamptonshire; I do\nnot know if it is a great property.\"\n\n\"You may make up your mind that it is, and that something will come of\nit, my dear Miss Bennet. A baronet! the very thing for Miss Darcy. Her\nbrother and your sister would be sure to look high. Was he not a fine\nyoung man, and did they not make a nice couple?\"\n\n\"I do not know--I did not think of it; but, Mrs. Jennings--\"\n\n\"No, no, indeed, of course not. We all know what your thoughts were full\nof\" (laughing heartily), \"and very naturally, too. Never mind, my dear,\nwe shall hear all about it before long, and you shall see if I ain't\nright. Lord! what a thing this will be to Elinor! She thinks no one is\ngood enough for Miss Darcy. Well, well, it will be an evening to look\nforward to. Only come and tell me when I am to make my congratulations,\nfor they will be on the tip of my tongue, and monstrous glad I shall be\nto get them off. Will it be to-night, I wonder, or to-morrow night?\nThese young sailors can't afford to let the grass grow under their feet.\nAnd your dress, my dear, what did you say it was going to be?\"\n\nIn such pleasant anticipations the time passed quickly until the\nre-entrance of Mrs. Ferrars with her note, when Kitty felt obliged to\nreturn to Pemberley, as their visitors were to arrive early, and there\nwere still many preparations to be completed. As she walked homewards,\nshe was in a glow of delight over the visions which their talk had\nevoked, and Mrs. Jennings's prophecy with regard to Georgiana and Mr.\nBertram fitted into its place in the same cheerful picture. Undoubtedly\nMrs. Jennings was quite right; she so seldom erred in her judgments!\nKitty could not recollect that those two had ever seemed specially\npleased with each other, but in all probability they were, for, now that\nshe came to think of it, there was no one else for Georgiana, and Mr.\nBertram matched her as naturally as Mr. Price did Kitty herself. Yes, it\nwas most likely that they would soon be engaged, perhaps married, before\nanother, and to Kitty, a more interesting couple! No, that would\ncertainly not do. If the wedding at Longbourn must be a less magnificent\naffair than the one at Pemberley, if Kitty could not aspire to a\nwedding-dress trimmed with such lace as Miss Darcy had inherited from\nher mother, at all events she would have the honour and importance of\nbeing married first. With smiles of satisfaction, she pictured the\nsending out of the invitations, and had decided on the form of them, and\nthe number of recipients, by the time she re-entered the house.\n\nThe same subject absorbed the attention of the two ladies she had just\nleft. Mrs. Jennings could not refrain from recounting to her hostess the\nconjecture she had instantly founded upon her knowledge of Mr. Bertram's\nexistence; and though Mrs. Ferrars was well acquainted with her friend's\nflights of imagination, she had no positive arguments to array against\nthis one, and was obliged to content herself with urging Mrs. Jennings\nto let no hint drop of her suspicions until something should occur to\nconfirm them, as it would be so painful for both the young people. Mrs.\nJennings promised caution, at the same time being evidently unwilling to\nrelinquish an idea that pleased her so much, and Mrs. Ferrars perceived\nthat it would be necessary to repeat the warnings very often before the\nfollowing evening, when her friend and her husband would go to the\nPemberley ball without her, as she dreaded over-fatigue; on the first\nevening, the occasion of the charades, she intended to be present, and\nhoped to be able to control and check Mrs. Jennings's remarks, should\nthey threaten to become embarrassing. Knowing her intense and\nfreely-expressed interest in her fellow-creatures, Mrs. Jennings's\nfriends would have been glad to bargain for not more than _one_ love\naffair to be in progress at one time under her eyes!\n\nThe arrival of the party from Desborough could not fail to bring, even\nto dignified Pemberley, a pleasant sense of bustle and excitement; and\nin the first flood of greetings, introductions, and inquiries, Elizabeth\nand her husband were only aware of a generally agreeable impression of\nMr. Bingley's two young guests; of Tom Bertram, good-looking,\nfashionable, easy and talkative, and of William Price, with his shorter,\nsturdier figure, fine open countenance, and manners which, with no want\nof animation, yet attracted by their quiet simplicity. Even in the short\ntime since the two sets of friends had been parted, a great deal seemed\nto have happened which must be talked over. Bingley wished to narrate,\nto anyone who would listen to him, the wonderful achievements of his\nshooting-party yesterday, who had accounted for an incredible number of\npheasants; Mr. Bertram had taken possession of Georgiana, in order to\npropound to her at great length a scheme for altering and improving\nseveral of the charade scenes; and William Price, who was somehow\nestablished on a settee by Kitty, was telling her how far he had\nsucceeded in the task she had bequeathed to him, of endeavouring to\nteach Mrs. Bingley's parrot to talk. The whole party were comfortably\ndisposed round the drawing-room fire, and looked like remaining there\nuntil it was time to dress for dinner; but Tom Bertram, not satisfied\nwith explaining, wished to demonstrate, and presently asked if he might\nsee the acting-room, after which he was not long in requesting the\npresence of his whole company there, to see if they understood their\nmovements and positions on the new stage. Kitty had undertaken to show\nhim all their preparations, and had carried off William Price with her,\nand Bingley followed, with many good-humoured grumblings, summoning his\nsister, who was not anxious to break off conversation with Colonel\nFitzwilliam, in the course of which she was examining him closely as to\nhis reasons for quitting London so abruptly in the summer. It was\nnecessary, however, to assert her position as leading lady, so she\njoined the others, Georgiana slipping in with her, and watching for\nopportunities to make herself useful, while in the intervals she put the\nfinal stitches in a head-dress for Kitty. Mrs. Bingley was allowed to\nexcuse herself, pleading fatigue, and the presence of a sufficiently\nlarge number of persons at this informal rehearsal, a reason fully\njustified by the bursts of laughter and sounds of prolonged argument\nwhich occasionally penetrated through the folding doors.\n\nWhen, after a hasty toilet, the actors returned to the saloon, the\ndinner guests had already arrived. Kitty was so distressingly conscious\nof the confidences she had so freely given, that she kept in the\nbackground while the two young men were being introduced to Mrs.\nJennings, and avoided meeting her eye. Mrs. Jennings shook hands with\nthem both warmly, and congratulated them upon having discovered such a\ndelightful form of amusement for themselves and the young ladies as\nacting charades, these long evenings.\n\n\"Madam,\" returned Tom Bertram, with a bow, \"let us hope that the\namusement will not be entirely on the side of the performers, since the\nhard work is not the exclusive share of the spectators.\"\n\n\"Oh, law, Mr. Bertram, you quite mistake me; as to amusement, I can\nassure you it will be the greatest treat to me and Mrs. Ferrars; but you\nmust admit that the hard work is not just the sort a young fellow gets\nsoon tired of, is it, now?\"\n\n\"You think so, because you cannot see behind the scenes, Mrs. Jennings,\"\ninterposed William Price, assuming an air of solemnity; \"I do not\nimagine my cousin would care to have command of a troupe of actors, such\nas we are, for long together; you have no conception of what amount of\ntrouble we give him, I mean, the unruly ones.\"\n\nMrs. Jennings highly appreciated the allusion which she supposed these\nwords to contain, and tapping William on the arm with her fan, she\nexclaimed: \"Ay, ay, Mr. Price, I understand you, but you and Mr. Bertram\nwill have the whip-hand by and by, and then you can get some of your own\nback.\"\n\n\"I am sure Mr. Bertram is an excellent stage-manager,\" said Mrs.\nFerrars, who had not heard all that passed, but judged by Mr. Price's\npuzzled look, and Mrs. Jennings's laughter, that it was time to\nintervene; \"I cannot think how you have been able to work up your\ncharades and be ready for an audience within so short a time.\"\n\n\"It can only be proved that the charades are sufficiently worked up,\nwhen we see whether the audience are sufficiently perplexed by them,\"\nsaid Bingley. \"If you guess the words at once, we shall feel that we\nhave utterly failed.\"\n\n\"Do not overestimate our intellects, my dear Bingley,\" said his host.\n\"As Mrs. Jennings says, these charades are sport to you, and as a\nnatural consequence they are presumably death to us.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Darcy,\" exclaimed Bingley, in the midst of the storm of\nlaughing protests evoked by this remark, \"think of the acting, and the\nsplendid _mise en sc\u00c3\u00a8ne_, if your heart fails within you. Besides, you\ncan always applaud. Nowadays it is the fashion to admire loudest what\none understands least.\"\n\nDarcy led the way to the dining-room with Mrs. Jennings, and as the\nladies of the party out-numbered the gentlemen, William Price found that\nit fell to his lot to escort both Miss Darcy and Miss Bennet. The\nformer, seeing this, stepped on for a pace or two in advance, and Kitty,\nas she took his arm, murmured: \"How _discouraging_ Darcy is! He always\nmanages to make one feel that he despises the things we are doing.\"\n\nWilliam glanced to see if Mr. Darcy's sister had heard, and rejoined, \"I\nshould hardly have thought so. He is only teasing, I fancy, and you know\nhe was speaking to Mr. Bingley, and they probably understand each other\nparticularly well.\"\n\n\"Still,\" said Kitty, \"I must say I do not like that sort of teasing; it\nis very provoking to be continually laughed at, and for one's best\nfriend to do it makes it all the worse.\"\n\n\"No, no, Miss Bennet, I am afraid I can't agree with you there; one can\nput up with anything from one's best friend, or at all events with\nthings which one would not stand for a moment from anyone else. I wonder\nif Miss Darcy feels that too?\" he added, as they settled themselves into\ntheir places at the table.\n\n\"I am not quite sure,\" replied Georgiana, when the question had been\nexplained to her. \"I think that ridicule may be harder to bear from our\nfriends than from an uninterested person, merely because one feels they\nought to know best what is painful to one--if it is of a painful kind;\nbut on the other hand, one may always feel sure that a real friend had\nno intention of saying anything of the sort.\"\n\n\"That would not be much good to _me_!\" cried Kitty. \"I find it is too\nlate, when I have already been very much vexed with anyone, to remember\nthat they really did not mean to vex me.\"\n\n\"Of course, it is not much consolation, when the blow has been already\ndealt,\" said Georgiana musingly; \"I meant that when one has reason to\nbelieve no unkind motive exists behind anything one's friend says, then\none is not expecting to be hurt.\"\n\nKitty did not want to seem inclined to pursue the subject, and William\nPrice, after a moment's pause, said: \"I imagine that you mean, by a\nmotive, the general feeling of goodwill in your friend's mind towards\nyou. I should doubt if people really have a distinct motive for every\nlittle thing they do and say--at all events, they would have some\ndifficulty in defining one. But perhaps you yourself, Miss Darcy, are a\nstudent of motives--perhaps your own actions are determined by a clear\npurpose?\"\n\n\"Mine? Oh, dear, no,\" said Georgiana, looking up at him, and down again\nwith a bright blush. \"I think it is rather interesting to speculate upon\nother people's motives and to wonder what hidden impulses make them do\ncertain things which seem hard to account for; but as to myself--oh, no,\nI never understand my own motives--I do not always know what they are.\nDo you understand yours?\"\n\n\"Well, yes, I think so; not that I have ever troubled much about it, but\non general principles, I think I always do things, or try to do them,\neither because I want to very much, or because it is a matter of\nprofessional duty.\"\n\n\"Then you are decidedly to be congratulated, Mr. Price,\" said Georgiana,\nsmiling. \"I should--I mean, most people would think themselves\nfortunate if they had two such burning lights to guide them. I suppose\nthe way is so clear that you do not need to seek any further motives, as\nto why you want to do the thing so much, for instance?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" promptly replied William, \"that would be looking back.\nHow would one ever steer a ship, unless one kept one's eyes fixed on the\ncourse ahead? If you suspect there are rocks, you must avoid them, but\nit would be a waste of time wondering how you came to be where you are.\nYou see that, too, do you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, I see what you mean,\" replied Georgiana, \"but I am afraid I have\nnot learnt to steer my ship quite so well, or perhaps I have too many\nlights, and they are confusing.\"\n\nWilliam began to reply, but was interrupted by Kitty, tired of a\nconversation in which she had no share. \"Mr. Price, do you know what you\nhave done? refused the lobster sauce! What can you be thinking of? your\nturbot will not be half so nice without it!\"\n\nWilliam made proper apologies to the bearer of the lobster sauce, who\nreturned it at Kitty's summons, and she was pacified by Mr. Price's\napplying himself to his dinner, and entering heartily into a\nreminiscence of hers at a dinner-party at Mrs. Knightley's, when they\nhad met for the first time, and when there had also--strange\ncoincidence--been turbot for dinner.\n\nGeorgiana was glad to sit for a while in silent thought. Mr. Price's\nsuggestion, that her life was governed by a distinct purpose, appeared\nsadly wide of the mark. Did not the mistakes she had made in the past\nshow that she was merely drifting, lamentably weak, and having no sound\njudgment of her own? Whereas people like Kitty, who had given themselves\nup to the guidance of a definite aspiration, and Mr. Price, too, who had\nowned what lights he was steering by, would they not soon be in safe\nharbour? It seemed so, and Georgiana almost envied them of that\ndelightful security, for of late she had allowed herself to wonder if\nsuch heights of happiness would ever be attainable by herself, and a\nlonging had sometimes crept over her, since she had known and liked Mr.\nPrice, that she might meet someone who could be to her what he was to\nKitty.\n\nThroughout the remainder of dinner she did not have any further\nconversation with William Price, though occasionally appealed to by one\nor other of them to give an opinion upon some point at issue, generally\nconnected with the charades. With Mrs. Ferrars, who sat on her other\nside, she enjoyed a quiet little talk, and before they left the table\nElinor inquired casually whether Mr. Bertram was nice--whether they had\nfound him pleasant.\n\n\"Yes, I think so--I think we all like him very much,\" replied Georgiana,\nwho until that moment had not formed any estimate of him. \"He is very\nlively--and he has taken an immense deal of trouble about the\ncharades--and Mr. Bingley, I know, considers him an excellent shot.\"\n\n\"That is quite an adequate description of him in a few words,\" said\nElinor. \"I wondered what you all thought of him, as I know you had not\nmet before. He is not much like his cousin, is he?\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" responded Georgiana, speaking with more animation. \"Could\nyou imagine a greater contrast? One can see at a glance how different\ntheir lives and professions have been, and how different their\ncharacters must be.\"\n\n\"I should be interested to hear,\" said Elinor in a low tone, and with a\nsmile, \"what you take to be the chief points of unlikeness in their\ncharacters, if you were not sitting too near to one of them to tell\nme.\"\n\nGeorgiana smiled and shook her head. \"I could not very well, and I am\nsure you can read faces as well as anybody.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Elinor, \"that the one we mentioned first is heir to\na title and a large estate.\"\n\n\"I believe so,\" replied Georgiana, \"but the other is fortunate in\nneeding neither titles nor large estates to recommend him.\"\n\nElinor needed nothing further to convince her that Mrs. Jennings's\nsuspicions, as far as Georgiana was concerned, were perfectly\ngroundless; what the Bingleys might be desiring of her, or Mr. Bertram\naiming at, was another matter. Certainly an onlooker could hardly help\nthinking of the probabilities of the match, with a handsome and wealthy\nyoung man on the one side, and a girl of Georgiana's beauty,\naccomplishments and high birth on the other.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII\n\n\nAll went well; the dinner came to an end; the actors retired to dress,\nand the six members of the audience disposed themselves in armchairs in\nfront of the curtain, and prepared to be mystified. The performance\ncommenced after no longer delay than is usual on occasions of this kind,\nand opened with a duel scene, in which Bingley and Tom Bertram aimed\npistols at one another in a most realistic manner, but failed to kill\neach other, owing to one weapon missing fire, and the ball of the other\nnot penetrating a vital part. Two of the ladies rushed in and made\ndemonstrations of relief at finding the wounded hero able to walk off\nthe field. The next scene represented a card-room, with a party of\nplayers, and Bingley as the inveterate gambler staking higher and\nhigher, until all was lost on turning up of a fatal four of hearts. Next\nwas seen William Price as Richard I, in prison, aroused from despair at\nthe sound of Blondel's harp, and the vision at the barred window of the\nminstrel, impersonated by Miss Bingley, cloaked and hooded and playing\non a zither. The whole word gave a fine opportunity to Tom Bertram to\nexhibit his comedy powers in the part of a gentleman whose pocket is\npicked of a purse of money, his lamentations to his family, his efforts\nto recover it, and the final restoration of the purse, by then totally\nempty.\n\nMuch laughter and applause followed this conclusion, and though the word\n\"misfortune\" was presently discovered by the audience without any\nfurther help, they were delighted with the spirited and vigorous quality\nof the acting, which had conveyed so much to them in dumb show, not a\nword being spoken on the stage. Darcy's only adverse criticism was that\nso far there had not been enough for the ladies to do; but this defect\nwas remedied in the next word, which consisted of only three scenes. In\nthe first, Miss Bingley made a very tolerable Lady Macbeth, striving to\ncleanse her hands of blood while she walks in her sleep, and is observed\nby her gentlewoman and doctor; the second showed Joan of Arc, in the\nperson of Kitty, led to the stake, while the others grouped themselves\nround and endeavoured to look as numerous as possible, in the parts of\nthe judges, soldiers and executioners. Poor Kitty's slight figure, and\ninsignificant presence, made it difficult for the character to be well\nrealized in her; and Mr. Bertram's frown as he looked at her was not an\nassumed one, for he had originally cast Miss Darcy for the part, and had\nexpostulated vehemently when she had insisted on yielding to the\nbroadly-hinted-at wishes of her friend. Finally, Mrs. Bingley, as\nCleopatra, looked exceedingly handsome in a robe as Egyptian as it could\nbe made on short notice, and received the asp from a basket held by\nGeorgiana, while Miss Bingley represented her other \"handmaid.\"\n\nThis word was not so easily guessed as the other, and Darcy and\nFitzwilliam were the first to arrive at it, while Elizabeth had to\nattend to the panegyrics of Mrs. Jennings and the more quietly expressed\nadmiration of Mr. and Mrs. Ferrars. The former had indeed forgotten that\nthere was anything to guess, so enchanted was she with the whole\nproceeding, so convinced that Miss Bennet and Miss Darcy were two of the\nmost beautiful and gifted beings who had ever appeared on any stage, and\nit was only by making really meritorious effort at self-control, that\nshe refrained from descanting on the good fortune of the two young men\nwhom she supposed to be their respective admirers. She was still talking\neagerly about the dresses, and the snake, and the pile of wood that\nlooked so terribly real, and Mr. Bertram's being so clever and funny\nwhen he pretended to be angry, when the curtain rose on a new scene, and\nthe spectators found themselves in another period of the past. Miss\nBingley, an unmistakable Queen Elizabeth, graciously received a folio\nfrom Shakespeare, handed a ring to Essex, and on departing, stepped on a\ncloak laid down for her by Raleigh. In spite of this astonishing\ndisregard for chronology, the scene was greatly enjoyed, as was also the\nnext, which with the aid of a great deal of imagination, represented the\ndeck of a ship. Here William Price had the leading part; he received a\nparty of ladies on board, showed them all round the vessel, in such a\nlively manner that the deficiencies in the setting of the stage were\nhardly observed, gave orders to his sailors, and finally took an\naffectionate farewell of his friends, with much waving of handkerchiefs\nas the ship was supposed to sail away, and Kitty wept real tears of\nnervousness and excitement. The audience had had time to put the first\nand second syllables together while the ship was being cleared away, and\nthey were in a measure prepared for the subject of the last scene,\nwhich reflected great credit on the stage-manager. It was a very pretty\nadaptation of _The Taming of the Shrew_, and showed the young girls in\nthe characters of Bianca and Katharina, Kitty, of course, taking that of\nher namesake, in an episode of her stormy wooing by Petruchio, while\nGeorgiana, as Bianca, submitted to a gentler form of love-making over a\nmusic lesson. The curtain was lowered for a moment before the sequel was\ngiven, wherein the two husbands, enacted by Tom Bertram and William\nPrice, wager of their wives' obedience, and the conduct of the sisters\nproved how far marriage had altered them. To Mrs. Jennings's extreme\ndelight, the part of Petruchio was taken by William Price, and this\nseemed to her to settle the whole manner finally, a view which was\nconfirmed when she heard the word \"courtship\" passed from one to another\nof her companions.\n\n\"What do you think of that now, my dear?\" she whispered loudly into the\near of Mrs. Ferrars. \"What have I been telling you all along? Nothing\ncould be clearer. A very pretty way of showing their friends, I say.\n'Courtship,' you see, my dear. Ha ha! very pretty indeed. No, no, trust\nme. I shall not say a word until I am told. I know better than that. And\nthe other one, too. It all points the same way, does it not? Well, I\ndeclare, I have not seen anything to please me so much this long time.\"\n\nThe actors presently reappeared, when they had resumed ordinary dress,\nall a good deal fatigued, but in high spirits and much gratified by the\nunstinted congratulations of their friends. Mrs. Bingley and Miss Darcy,\nindeed, shrank from praise, for to Georgiana it had all been rather an\nordeal when the time came, and she had been conscious of doing her part\nstiffly and without natural ease, and Jane declared she had not acted at\nall, for she would not have known how to do it; she had simply stood\nabout, under Mr. Bertram's directions, and worn the clothes that had\nbeen contrived for her. But the others were not so diffident, for\nBingley and William Price had enjoyed the whole thing heartily, and\nappreciated the joke of throwing themselves into an imaginary character.\nKitty had enjoyed the acting and the applause, the pleasure of being\nwith William Price had been quite intoxicating, and not being altogether\nwithout aptitude, she had really acquitted herself with some spirit,\nparticularly in the scenes from _The Taming of the Shrew_. But it was to\nMiss Bingley and Mr. Bertram, in their own estimation, that the honours\nof the evening belonged. They received all compliments with the utmost\ncomplacency, and Caroline was heard explaining to Mr. Ferrars and\nColonel Fitzwilliam, as they all moved towards the dining-room for\nsupper, that she had modelled her conception of Lady Macbeth on that of\nMrs. Siddons, which she had seen so frequently and studied so closely as\nto be quite at home in the portrayal of it. The lady might perhaps have\nselected other listeners had she known the associations which one of\nthem had with that play.\n\n\"It does you great credit, Miss Bingley,\" said Darcy, who had been\nlistening to her. \"It has been an evening of surprises, has it not,\nElizabeth? I could not have believed that there was so much hidden\ntalent among us, which would never have been unburied but for the happy\nidea of these charades.\"\n\n\"It is always so, I can assure you, Mr. Darcy,\" said Tom Bertram. \"Once\nyou decide to act, you can always discover talent in any collection of\npeople, ample for your needs. Of course, one or two will always stand\nout, by reason of greater ability; but you must know how to select your\nplayers, so that everyone has a part worthy of him.\"\n\n\"I am afraid some of us had parts we were not worthy of, to-night,\"\ncried William. \"I never felt such a fool as when I was playing\nPetruchio, and nothing but the kindness of Miss Bennet could have pulled\nme through. It needs a fellow about six feet high; I always said you\nought to have done it yourself, Tom.\"\n\n\"My dear William, we have been through all this before. You know, I\nshould have liked nothing better, but I decided, after due\nconsideration, that I could not do justice to the principal part, when I\nhad to be directing the full company, all on stage at once. You hardly\nrealize my responsibility. But, rest assured, you did not do it so\nbadly.\"\n\n\"I think you managed most wonderfully, Mr. Bertram,\" said Mrs. Ferrars.\n\"To have to arrange the scenes, drill the other performers, and appear\nin every scene yourself! It was a task few people could have\nundertaken.\" Mr. Bertram bowed, as if there were a foregone conclusion.\n\n\"Mr. Bertram has had a good deal of experience in private theatricals,\"\nsaid Georgiana.\n\n\"I have, indeed,\" said that gentlemen. \"Few men in England have had\nmore, I should say, and anyone who is known to be fairly well up in\nthese things, is naturally in request whenever they are going forward.\nAnd I have been lucky, too, in my companies. I do not think I have ever\nknown a real failure, except perhaps once--\"\n\nMrs. Ferrars's attention was just then called off, and he turned to\nGeorgiana. \"Did I ever tell you, Miss Darcy, about that one time when we\nattempted to do a little acting at my father's house--at Mansfield\nPark?\"\n\n\"No, I do not think you did.\"\n\n\"Well, it is a long story; it might not wholly interest you--thank you,\nyes, some cold chicken--but the substance of it was that we had decided\nto act a play, amongst ourselves, you know; a pleasant party--divided\namong the two households, as this might be; just the very people for\nacting; free to rehearse--it is true my brother had made some\ndifficulties; but all was going smoothly and our friends seemed to be\nthen all one could wish. I am not sure that Miss Crawford had much idea\nof acting; but still, she might have improved.\"\n\n\"Miss Crawford!\" exclaimed Georgiana, and involuntarily glanced round to\nmake sure that Colonel Fitzwilliam had not overheard her. Seeing him\noccupied in talking to William Price, she continued in a lower tone: \"I\ndid not know that you knew Miss Crawford, and I am so much interested.\nHave you heard anything of her lately?\"\n\nMr. Bertram could hardly believe his ears. He looked at Miss Darcy in\nthe greatest astonishment. \"Certainly I know, or used to know, Miss\nCrawford, but, naturally, I have not heard anything of her for several\nyears.\"\n\nGeorgiana was puzzled by his manner, and felt that in some strange way\nshe had made a mistake; so after a moment's pause she said: \"It was\nstupid of me not to recollect that you must be acquainted with Miss\nCrawford too, as I was already aware that Mr. Price was. I suppose it\nwas at the same time you were speaking of--at your father's house--that\nhe met her.\"\n\nMr. Bertram had by this time partly recovered from the shock of finding\nthere was anyone who did not know of the Rushworth-Crawford case, and\nsaid: \"I beg your pardon, Miss Darcy, but your question was a surprise\nto me. No, I have quite lost sight of Miss Crawford, and I daresay you\nknow more of her now than I do. You are a friend of hers, I assume.\"\n\n\"No,\" returned Georgiana, beginning to regret having pursued the\nsubject, \"I have only met her once, for a few minutes, but my brother\nand sister knew her fairly well in Bath.\"\n\n\"In Bath? Ah, yes, I heard that they had settled there.\"\n\nGeorgiana now wished nothing better than to find a new topic or a new\ncompanion without delay; but Mr. Bertram, having rapidly disposed of his\ncold chicken, began again: \"You must not mistake me, Miss Darcy. I\nshould be very glad to hear good news of Miss Crawford once more. It is\na long time since our families held any intercourse, for--without going\ninto details, her brother behaved like--indeed, is--an intolerable\nscoundrel; but as to his sister, she had nothing to do with that. She\nenjoyed amusing herself, I fancy, as much as most people do, but there\nwas really no harm in it, as events proved. We all thought her a very\nbright, pretty, accomplished girl. But one thing followed another, and,\nof course, people are bound to hold by their relations, are they not?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" assented Georgiana warmly, who had listened with the\ndeepest interest to this recital, which, fragmentary though it was,\nseemed to agree with that strange rumour which Lady Catherine had\nwritten about from Bath. She pondered over it, and though reluctant to\nbe indebted to Mr. Bertram for further information, she could not help\nwanting to have her own opinion once more confirmed.\n\n\"I am glad to hear you say that, Mr. Bertram. I thought Miss Crawford\ncharming, and I heard the same from everyone who met her; but I think\nshe may have been misjudged--blamed, perhaps, some time or other, for\nthe faults of those who belonged to her.\"\n\n\"Quite true, Miss Darcy; I have no doubt you have hit upon the secret.\nIndeed, my brother-in-law, Yates, used to say much the same. She was\ncertainly a very handsome girl, and it was a thousand pities she never\nhad the chance to play Amelia. I did not finish telling you about our\nplay: the parts were all cast, the stage was prepared, the rehearsals in\nfull progress. Yates was, after myself, the leading spirit--I think you\nsaid you had met my friend Yates, Miss Darcy--\"\n\nHe was fairly started, and Georgiana had time to grow weary of the\nhistory of _Lovers' Vows_ and its ultimate conclusion, before the\nannouncement was made of \"Mr. and Mrs. Ferrars's carriage,\" which broke\nup the party. Everyone moved towards the hall, and cloaks were fetched\nwhile Mrs. Jennings loudly uttered her good-nights interspersed with\nmany complimentary remarks to the actors. William Price had hurried back\nto the room they had called the green room, to search for a cherished\nornament of Kitty's which she had mislaid, so he escaped from\ncongratulations to which, in his case, Mrs. Jennings would have given a\ndouble edge, and Kitty contrived to avert her share by murmuring as she\nembraced her guest: \"I shall come and see you to-morrow.\" Nevertheless,\nMrs. Jennings was not to be entirely baulked of her intention, and the\nlong conversation between Mr. Bertram and Miss Darcy had attracted her\nnotice; so in wishing Tom Bertram good-night, she managed to add a few\nwords, felicitating him upon his success in another field besides that\nof the drama. Laughing heartily at his look of blank astonishment, she\npassed on, and as she never felt quite as well able to approach Miss\nDarcy on these subjects as other people, she contented herself with a\nsly glance, remarking: \"Well, Miss Darcy, and what a delightful evening\nit has been! We have not heard the last of these charades yet, for many\na long day, have we? Why, all the pleasantest part of them is still to\ncome, I fancy.\"\n\nGeorgiana succeeded in avoiding a reply; she supposed the allusion was\nto Kitty, but she always preferred _not_ to understand Mrs. Jennings\nwhenever possible. The visitors directly afterwards went away, and the\nladies retired, the gentlemen sitting up for some time longer.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIX\n\n\nIt was impossible for either Kitty or Georgiana to think of anything\nelse when they first awoke the next morning, than that it was the\nconcluding day of William Price's visit. Twenty-four hours more, and he\nwould be on the point of departure. Twenty-four short hours were all\nthat was left for an event of such prodigious importance. Georgiana knew\nof her friend's half-formed hopes that the acting in the last scene of\nthe charades might have afforded an opening for the reality, and Kitty\nhad not been a little chagrined at William's pronouncement that he\nwished Mr. Bertram had taken the part, but a night's rest had dispersed\nthese clouds, and in the happiest frame of mind, Miss Bennet went down\nearly, ready to make the most of every instant of this precious day. A\ndisappointment awaited her shortly after breakfast, for Mr. Darcy was so\nbarbarous as to propose taking the gentlemen to see the farm and the\nhorses, and to this they actually agreed, Bingley only stipulating that\nthey should return in good time, as he had made an arrangement to ride\nwith Georgiana. The damp and muddy state of the ground would not permit\nof the ladies accompanying them, even the most venturesome, and when\nthey had all set out, Kitty found that there was nothing for her to do\nuntil their return but to hurry to the Rectory in search of the\nconsolation which Mrs. Jennings was always ready to offer.\n\nMrs. Darcy found an opportunity during the morning for a little quiet\ntalk with her sister. Jane so thoroughly liked and respected Mr. Price\nthat she was delighted to find Elizabeth in agreement with her and\nrelated many instances of his sterling common sense, good taste, and\namiable disposition, which she had had time, during her longer\nacquaintance, to meet with. Elizabeth hazarded the suggestion as to his\npresumed intentions towards Kitty, that however earnest they may be, it\nwas possible that he did not mean to make her an offer at present, for\nhis circumstances might not permit of it; he was still young, and his\nprospects might not be assured enough to warrant him in taking a wife.\nJane was not inclined to think that any such obstacles stood in his way.\nHis cousin had told her that he had saved a considerable sum of money,\nand that his brothers now being all out in the world, his family were no\nlonger dependent on his help. Besides which, he knew he would be made a\ncommander by the end of the year, and after that, it was only a matter\nof short time, to an officer of his experience, especially if a little\ninterest could be exercised, before he obtained a ship of his own.\nBingley had heard of him from several persons in London, and all agreed\nthat there was not a more promising young lieutenant in the service.\nThese were the days of quick promotion, and his career so far gave rise\nto no expectation that he would be left behind.\n\nElizabeth heard it all with pleasure, and would not give utterance to\nher solitary regret, that Kitty should have been fated to fall in love\nwith a man who, in the event of their marriage, would be obliged to\nspend the greater part of the year away from her.\n\nThe gentlemen had returned from their walk by twelve o'clock, and\nFitzwilliam and the two cousins waited near the front door to watch\nBingley and Miss Darcy starting for their ride. Hardly had the horses\nmoved off, and Colonel Fitzwilliam was considering what the guests might\nlike to do next, when Tom Bertram seized William by the arm, and with a\nword of apology to the Colonel, carried him off to a distant patch.\n\n\"I want to speak to you, William,\" he began, with some abruptness, \"and\nMiss Bennet will be popping out on us if I do not take this chance. I\nwant to know--did you happen to hear what that gossiping old woman, Mrs.\nJenkins, or what ever she is called, said to me last night, just as she\nwas leaving?\"\n\n\"I certainly did not hear anything particular, but I'm afraid one never\ndoes pay much attention to Mrs. Jennings,\" returned William.\n\n\"Then let me tell you, she had the impertinence to give me the broadest\nhint I ever had in my life--to give _me_, if you please!--that I was\npaying court to Miss Darcy. I never was more astounded. I forget exactly\nwhat she said, but she made it quite clear, and--yes, one remark I do\nrecollect, something about the 'charming future Lady Bertram.'\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" exclaimed William, \"what unpardonable insolence! I have\nnever heard anything more outrageously offensive. Was she--I hope, I\nhope, Tom, that Miss Darcy did not hear any of this?\"\n\n\"No, she was nowhere near at the time, but imagine my feelings, William,\nnever having dreamed of such a thing, and then having it suddenly\nbrandished in my face, as it were, by that odiously vulgar woman.\"\n\n\"It was disagreeable, certainly, but I am thinking more of Miss Darcy's\nfeelings, as from what I know of her, I can conceive nothing which would\nbe more repugnant to her, than to have such a subject bandied about in\njest.\"\n\n\"Well, you may make your mind easy, for she was certainly not listening.\nBut that was not what I wanted to say. Of course, it was a complete\nsurprise to me, but once it had been put into my head, I could not help\nthinking of it, and, indeed, I have been pondering over it ever since,\nand have come to the conclusion that it would not be at all a bad\nthing.\"\n\n\"What is this?\" exclaimed William. \"Do you expect me to listen to you\nwith patience, Tom, when not three weeks ago you were sighing over Miss\nThorpe, and regretted your parents' objection to her, and declaring\nthere was not such another girl in the world?\"\n\n\"You need not be so hasty, William. You talk as if I were already on my\nknees to Miss Darcy, when I have no intentions whatever towards her; the\nidea has simply been put into my head by the circumstances, and\nnaturally I must think it out.\"\n\n\"The idea has been put into your head by a foolish, chattering old\nwoman, if you call her a circumstance, and, coming from that quarter, is\nnot worth taking seriously for an instant.\"\n\n\"I do not know so much about that: it is true, she had no business to\nsay it, but there was a reason in what she said; Miss Darcy would make\nan admirable Lady Bertram. Imagine my father's and mother's\nsatisfaction, if I could present such a girl to them as their daughter.\"\n\n\"Good God, Tom!\" exclaimed William, tearing his arm away, \"the\ncold-blooded way in which you talk is more than one can bear. Weighing\none girl against another, as if it were a question of relative merit,\nwhich you would throw the handkerchief to. It is not much of a\ncompliment to Miss Darcy, to admit that you never thought whether she\nhad attractions or not, until Mrs. Jennings suggested it to you.\"\n\n\"I am not considering paying compliments to Miss Darcy, and I do not see\nwhy you should get so hot,\" rejoined his cousin. \"I merely wanted to\ntalk it out with you quietly, and ask your opinion; but it is perfectly\nuseless if you will fly into a passion at a word.\"\n\n\"Well, what do you want my opinion about?\" demanded William, trying to\nspeak in his ordinary tones.\n\nTom was easily placated, and really wanted to be talking, so he resumed:\n\"My difficulty is that I am more or less involved with Isabella. Of\ncourse, we are both perfectly free; nothing has passed between us that\nshe could construe into an engagement; I had to promise my parents that:\nbut at the same time I practically promised myself that I wouldn't do\nanything until I had seen her again, which I expect to do in January.\nNow, for the sake of this connection, would it be better for me to break\noff entirely with the Thorpes by degrees? You know, I like Isabella very\nmuch, it is her family that one sticks at, while these Darcys are\nunexceptionable in every way; but she herself is a devilishly fine girl,\nwith far more style about her than Miss Darcy, you must admit that.\"\n\n\"I think that the two ladies are not to be mentioned in the same breath\nwith each other,\" said William, with difficulty restraining his\nindignation.\n\n\"You think not? that was what I wanted to arrive at; well, perhaps you\nare right, though I always thought you needlessly prejudiced against\npoor Isabella. I certainly feel more and more the advantages of such an\nalliance as this, on the worldly side, that is; for their dispositions,\nI fancy that of my old friend would suit me best.\"\n\n\"Tom,\" said William, turning to face his cousin fully, \"I cannot think\nwhat possesses you to talk in this detestable way. Can you not feel how\nhorrible it is? If you care for Miss Thorpe, you cannot think of\nmarrying a girl you meet directly after leaving her, and have only known\nfor a week. Whereas, if you think for one moment of Miss Darcy with the\nfeelings a man ought to have, if marriage is in his mind, how can you\npossibly go on making comparisons between her and Miss Thorpe? Either\nway, it is abominable treatment of one of them.\"\n\n\"My dear William, you are going to the other extreme. Just now, you told\nme not to take anything Mrs. Jennings said seriously, yet you are\nassuming me to be in the most sober earnest all round, when all I want\nis to give the matter the consideration it deserves. Miss Darcy is very\ncharming, but I am quite heart-whole where she is concerned at present,\nand so, no doubt, is she as regards me. But everything must have a\nbeginning, and if such difficulties are to be put in way of my marrying\nIsabella, I could hardly do better than this; at any rate, it is worth\nthinking of. I shall go home and see how things develop in the course of\nthe weeks. I can always come over again, you know; it is not the ends of\nthe earth.\"\n\nWilliam broke from his cousin with an impatient gesture, and hurried\naway to another part of the grounds. Mr. Bertram looked after him in\nsurprise, shrugged his shoulders, and returned to the house, to\nestablish himself by the fireside with a newspaper. Many inquiries were\nmade for Mr. Price throughout the afternoon, to which Mr. Bertram could\nonly say that he had seen him last in the garden, and it was not until\nnearly dinner-time that he reappeared, with a heated, wearied look, and\nconfessed to having walked too far and missed his way in the park.\n\nKitty had been on the verge of tears, as the hours of his absence went\non, and even Georgiana had begun to look grave, but this explanation\nrevived their drooping spirits to a great extent. Anyone might lose\ntheir way in such a large park--nearly ten miles round! And on a dark,\nfoggy afternoon the paths looked all alike, and the stream had so many\nwindings! It was quite evident that this unlucky circumstance alone had\ncaused the delay. These considerations, and a most satisfactory glance\nat her mirror when she was dressed for the ball, renewed Kitty's bright\nhopes for the evening. She wished Lydia could see her now. How could\nregimental balls, however smart and gay, compare with the splendour, the\nimportance, of this occasion at Pemberley. The house, as she had always\nforeseen, was exactly right for a ball; the arrangements, the space, and\nall details were superior to those at Mrs. Knightley's house: her dress\nhad been given to her by Elizabeth, and was even prettier than the one\nshe had worn in London, and there seemed to be numbers of pleasant\npartners, including several officers, though these gentlemen were not\npersons of such consideration to Kitty as formerly, she having now\ndecided that the naval uniform was far handsomer than the military.\n\nIt only remained for Mr. Price to ask for her hand in the first two\ndances, and the gentlemen of the house were so long in appearing that\nshe was in the utmost terror lest she should be obliged to give them\naway before he arrived, but at last, among a crowd of other men entering\nthe room, she discerned him. He approached, passing close to Georgiana,\nwho was just being led into the ball-room by a neighbour and old friend,\nand came straight to where Kitty stood by Mrs. Bingley's side. How\ndelightful to hear the words, spoken in his own friendly way, and with\nhis own charming smile: \"Well, Miss Bennet, I hope I may have the honour\nof these two dances, if I am not too late?\"\n\nKitty very joyously accompanied him to a place next to Georgiana and her\npartner in the set, and with equal joy made an engagement for other\ndances later in the evening.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XX\n\n\nThe rooms filled and the ball proceeded, and many present who were\nfrequent visitors to Pemberley nevertheless felt that those noble rooms\nhad never before been the setting for a more brilliant scene. Mr. Darcy\nreceived innumerable congratulations upon having at last delighted the\nneighbourhood by permitting his house to be seen to such advantage, and\nnot having altogether looked forward to the evening, he surprised\nhimself by discovering how much, with Elizabeth at his side, he could\nenjoy both his own pleasure in entertaining guests, which he had not\npreviously done on so large a scale, and also the pleasure of others who\nwere important to him, Elizabeth, Georgiana, and the Bingleys. Georgiana\nin particular he watched with affectionate appreciation as she moved\nthrough the crowds, handsome and stately, generally grave, but\noccasionally lighting up into shy animation, and far more admired than\nshe knew or cared about.\n\nWilliam Price had been dancing for a second time with Kitty, and they\nwere sitting in a corridor, on some chairs placed below a cluster of\ncandles in a sconce projecting from the wall, when one of the candles\nguttered, and a few drops of hot wax fell on the edge of Kitty's chair,\nnarrowly escaping her gown. With an exclamation of annoyance, she sprang\nup, withdrawing quickly from the post of danger, and looking above them,\nboth perceived that the mischief was caused by a candle having loosened\nin its socket, and fallen a little to one side.\n\nWilliam immediately proposed that they should move to other seats, and\nshould summon a servant to replace the candle, but Kitty was in a wild\nand excitable mood, and would pay no heed. Laughing and calling out that\nshe would put it right herself in a moment, she sprang upon the chair,\nreaching as high as she could, and to the dismay of the onlookers,\nthrust her hand into the midst of the candles in order to grasp the\noffending one.\n\n\"Do, pray, Miss Bennet, come down!\" exclaimed William, and several other\npersons joined their entreaties to his. \"Do not try to do it; you will\nset your dress on fire--your sleeve is so dangerously near. Do let me\nhelp you down, lest you fall and hurt yourself.\"\n\nMrs. Jennings, who had been observing the couple during the dance, and\nhad followed them at a little distance, now arrived in time to hear\nKitty say: \"Thank you, Mr. Price, but I have already done it; and all is\nwell; I and my gown are quite safe, you see.\" And looking down at him\nwith a gay, triumphant smile, she gave him both her hands, and with this\nassistance jumped to the ground, adding: \"Now, was that not skilful of\nme? and if we had waited to discuss it, you would never have let me\nattend to it, though it was by far the best.\"\n\n\"I would have tried to prevent your running such risks, certainly,\"\nreplied William, but his quieter tones were lost in the noisy\ninterposition of Mrs. Jennings. \"Oh, my dear Miss Bennet, now how very\nnaughty of you! You have given poor Mr. Price quite a fright. Ah, Mr.\nPrice, she is a sad girl, I fear, but I am glad to see Petruchio is\nbeginning early to learn to keep her in better order. All your\nrehearsing in the charades will come in useful now, won't it? but I'll\nwarrant this Katherine will be just as apt a pupil as the other.\" The\nold lady laughed heartily at Kitty's blushes, and at William's blank,\nuncomfortable look. \"There, my dears, I won't disturb you any longer;\nonly I hope you will both come and talk to me whenever you feel\ninclined.\"\n\nKitty, who had resumed her seat, was the first to break the awkward\nsilence which followed this speech. \"Mrs. Jennings is a great talker, is\nshe not?\" she said, with a laugh. \"She seems able to think of nothing\nbut those charades, and would like to make one believe that the acting\nwas something wonderful.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said William, after a pause. He had not sat down, but remained\nstanding with a disconcerted air, twisting Kitty's fan about in his\nhands. \"It is very complimentary. I wonder if--whether all the\nspectators were equally impressed.\"\n\n\"Oh, I think they were,\" said Kitty eagerly. \"Even Darcy said some words\nin favour of it, and, you know, it is very hard to get any sort of\npraise out of him. And Mr. and Mrs. Ferrars were quite delighted. And my\nsister, too, Mrs. Darcy, said several times how much she liked it; she\nthought it so clever of Mr. Bertram to have arranged that scene.\"\n\nShe looked anxiously at William, and his face cleared somewhat, but he\ndid not sit down again, and replied so absentmindedly to a few more\nremarks made by Kitty that when sounds of music reached them, she was\nquite ready to go, and walked beside him to the ball-room, thinking\npetulantly that Mrs. Jennings had spoilt everything by coming just then,\nand saying what she had; that no one liked to be hurried, or could be\nexpected to declare himself in a crowd, and that perhaps he was vexed at\nhaving the words taken out of his mouth, as it were; altogether, the\nincident was thoroughly annoying.\n\nFor the next dance, she saw him invite Georgiana, but she was already\nengaged to Mr. Bertram, and he did not ask anyone else, but stood about\nwatching various people, and occasionally exchanging a few words with\nColonel Fitzwilliam and Mrs. Bingley, who were sitting down together\nduring the set. Kitty could see from where she was that they were trying\nto induce him to find another partner, but he laughingly resisted their\npersuasions, and continued to walk about the rooms until the dance was\nover, after which he stationed himself within a short distance of Miss\nDarcy's chair, and when a suitable interval had elapsed, he went up to\nher and again made his request.\n\nMiss Darcy acceded readily, and Mr. Bertram left them with by no means\nas much readiness. He had scarcely moved away when William began: \"Miss\nDarcy, should you mind not standing up for this one? I was wondering\nwhether you would be so kind as to show me some of the pictures in the\ngallery upstairs, which Mr. Darcy was speaking of at dinner. You know my\ntime is getting very short, and I should be sorry to go away without\nhaving seen them.\"\n\n\"With the greatest pleasure,\" returned Georgiana, \"and indeed I shall be\nglad not to dance any more at present. But you should have made my\nbrother show you the pictures, as he is a far better judge than I am. We\nmay find him up there, as he sometimes takes his friends round on these\noccasions.\"\n\nThe picture gallery, however, proved to be empty of visitors, and they\nstrolled through, Georgiana pointing out which were considered to be the\nbest paintings. William passed by them rather hurriedly, looking chiefly\nat the family portraits, and Georgiana, observing this, conducted him\nto the end of the gallery, where her brother's likeness hung. William\nstudied it for an instant, glancing at his companion as if trying to\ntrace a resemblance, while Georgiana told him the date of the picture,\nand repeated that she wished they had come up before, as he would have\nseen it and all the others so much better in daylight.\n\nShe noticed that William hardly seemed to take in what she said, and was\nnot altogether surprised when he turned suddenly to her and said, with\nscarcely concealed agitation: \"Miss Darcy, you are very kind, but at\nthis moment I cannot think of these pictures. Will you let me speak to\nyou for a moment? I have something important to say.\"\n\n\"He is going to tell me he has proposed to Kitty!\" flashed through\nGeorgiana's mind, and for one instant a rush of feeling almost\noverwhelmed her, but controlling herself as well as she could, she said\naloud: \"Certainly, Mr. Price. Do say anything you wish. Will you not sit\ndown? and I will do the same.\" She indicated two chairs opposite the\nportrait, and seated herself in one, but William remained standing,\nlooking at her with such a deep, earnest gaze, while he tightly clasped\nhis hands together, that he did not seem to have heard her words.\n\n\"Miss Darcy, you must forgive my presumption. It is a bad beginning to\nask for forgiveness, but I know--no one better--that it is not for me to\nspeak to you at present as I must speak. I would have waited, till my\nposition--till I was justified--but circumstances have made it\nimpossible to go away and wait in utter uncertainty, for an unknown\nfuture. I do not ask anything as yet, only a hearing--only that you will\nlet me tell you how truly and devotedly I love you, and have loved you\nfrom the first moment of my seeing you.\"\n\nA dreadful misgiving had passed over Georgiana at the beginning of this\nspeech, and only consternation kept her silent till its close. She\nsprang up, in a horror and dismay that would scarcely find expression,\nand exclaimed: \"Mr. Price! You to say such words to me! What _can_ you\nmean? What can anything mean? _You_--no, no, it is all some horrible\nmistake.\"\n\n\"No, Miss Darcy, indeed, it is no mistake,\" broke in William eagerly and\nearnestly. \"Do not be so distressed, I beg you. I do not ask you to give\nme any definite reply, though you can guess what perfect joy it would be\nto have one word of hope, however slight, from your lips--but I will\nwait and try to earn the right to ask for more. Next year my position\nwill have improved, and your brother will not perhaps think it quite out\nof the question. Nay, I implore you, dearest Miss Darcy, to hear me only\nthis once. I did not mean to trouble you so soon, but I could not bear\nto go, so far away, with no prospect of seeing you again, and knowing\nthat others might be near you, others far more eligible and desirable\nthan myself--you would understand, I am sure, if you only knew the tithe\nof what I felt.\"\n\n\"Mr. Price,\" said Georgiana, signing to him with her hand to stop, and\nstanding erect before him, \"I insist that you shall cease. I will hear\nno more of this. You cannot be in your right mind; at all events, you\nwill not find me so destitute of sense of honour as you think.\" She\npaused, choked with emotion at the thought of Kitty.\n\n\"Destitute of honour! when you know, Miss Darcy, that I think you the\npurest, loveliest, best of creatures. Forgive me if I have offended you,\nonly tell me how I may correct it. Do I wrong in speaking to you first?\nI will do whatever you wish; I would not grieve you for the world.\"\n\nWith great effort, Georgiana collected herself sufficiently to reply:\n\"These professions of yours amaze and horrify me. I cannot tell you\nwhether they are more painful to me if I have to regard them as true,\nthan if, as at present, they seem hypocritical. In any case, it is\nabsolutely inexplicable that you should use such language to me, you who\nfor months past have been recognized by all her friends as the admirer\nof my friend Miss Bennet.\"\n\nThe words were out, and Georgiana felt hot with shame as she uttered\nthem, conscious that even with the need for openness on this terrible\noccasion, the betraying of her friend's hopes to the object of them was\na shocking thing. She was so overcome as to be unable to look at William\nPrice's horror-struck face.\n\n\"Miss Bennet! It is possible that you thought I was paying attentions to\nMiss Bennet? Miss Darcy, you cannot be serious. This is too frightful. I\nnever thought of doing so, never dreamed of her expecting them, if she\ndid expect them. Miss Bennet was always gay and cheerful--she is a\ncharming girl, as we were excellent companions; but as for anything\nmore--surely you could not have been deceived, whoever else was, when\nyou alone were the subject of all my desires and hopes?\"\n\nGeorgiana shrank from the task of answering such an appeal, and took\nhold of another part of his sentence to reply to. \"She did expect them,\nMr. Price, and she received enough, at all events, to mislead her most\ncruelly. She has thought of no one but yourself, and of meeting again\nhere, for months past, and everything that has happened in the last week\nhad strengthened her in her belief in your attachment. You cannot deny,\"\ncontinued Georgiana, her indignation rising, \"that your constant\nassociation, her delight in your society, have given rise to expectation\nin the minds of her friends, if you dispute its existence in her own.\"\n\n\"No,\" said William, \"I cannot deny that, for I had a proof of it this\nevening in some remarks dropped by Mrs. Jennings; but though they\ndisturbed me momentarily, I dismissed them from my mind, as I knew she\nwas the kind of person whose chief delight lies in teasing young people\nabout each other, and I thought Miss Bennet, and her other friends, were\ntoo sensible to be continually entertaining such fancies.\"\n\n\"Fancies!\" repeated Georgiana warmly. \"My poor friend is completely\nwrapped up, heart and soul, in what you designate as a fancy.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I am very sorry,\" said William, looking utterly downcast, \"very\ngrieved and ashamed, if I have caused Miss Bennet a moment's uneasiness,\nthough I can hardly think that others, Mrs. Bingley and Mrs. Darcy, in\nparticular, have so completely failed to perceive--but it is useless to\nenter into the exact degrees of misunderstanding. I, at least, have been\nas thoroughly blind as a man could wish to be. What can I do, Miss\nDarcy, to prove to you my innocence? If I have occasioned this\nunfortunate error, it has been through ignorance, thoughtlessness,\nnothing more. Is there any one thing, any incident, you could tell me\nof, by which you may have been inadvertently misled?\"\n\nGeorgiana's ideas were so confused, and she was altogether so agitated\nthat at the moment she felt as if she would never be able to collect\nherself sufficiently to marshal her evidence, now it was required; but,\nluckily, as she tried to think, one episode darted into her memory,\nwhich had frequently been discussed between herself and Kitty, and had\nseemed to bear naturally but one interpretation. Painful though it was\nto bring such matters into dispute, she forced herself for Kitty's sake\nto say: \"Did you not tell Mrs. Knightley, after the ball which took\nplace at her house, that you had never enjoyed an evening more, and\nthat there was one person whose presence there had been everything to\nyou? Did you not give her to understand that you meant Miss Bennet?\"\n\nDistress and surprise were clearly shown on William's countenance. He\nbegan to speak, hesitated, and broke off, and then resumed: \"I know what\nyou mean, but it is all too bewildering. Surely Mrs. Knightley did not\ntell you that? I never spoke or thought of Miss Bennet in that\nconnection. Except that I had some pleasant dances with her, she might\nnot have existed for me that evening. I recollect telling Mrs. Knightley\nwhat a delightful evening I had had, and it was she who suggested that\none person's presence had contributed more to it than any other. I could\ndo nothing but agree with her, as I thought she had noticed my instant\nand intense admiration of you. It was so evident to me, that I supposed\nit was to others. I thought of no one else but you. When Mr. Bingley\ninvited me to stay with him, I was doubtful if I could accept, but\ndirectly he said that you lived in the same neighbourhood, I determined\nthat nothing should prevent my coming. Do you recollect anything else,\nMiss Darcy, our meeting at the Hursts', and Captain Wentworth saying\nthat you believed sailors to be fickle, which made me so uneasy until I\npersuaded myself that you did not mean it? Oh, do not shake your head,\ncontinue to misbelieve it, I entreat you. And in these last few days, if\nevents have happened to throw me more with Miss Bennet than with\nyourself, it has not been my doing, or my wish. I implore you to be\nconvinced of this, and to accept my assurances of my unswerving loyalty\nand devotion towards you.\"\n\nIt was impossible for Georgiana not to be moved by these words, though\nshe had tried to check their passionate flow, and had remained where she\nwas, leaning on a chair, solely because her trembling limbs would\nhardly support her. Now, however, summoning all her courage, and\nstrengthening herself with thoughts of Kitty, she spoke in a tolerably\nfirm voice. \"Mr. Price, I must believe that this unhappy mistake has\nbeen made unintentionally, since you say so, but the wretchedness it has\ncaused will not be so easily cleared away. The assurances of your\nloyalty should not be made to me, you owe them to Miss Bennet and her\nonly.\"\n\nShe could get no further, for she was interrupted by William with a\nvehemence exceeding any that he had shown before. \"Miss Bennet! Except\nas your friend, and as a lady for whom I have a great liking and\nrespect, Miss Bennet is nothing to me, and never could be. Oh, Miss\nDarcy, you do not yet understand me. Can you forget Miss Bennet for one\nmoment, and tell me if, apart from all that, there would be the\nslightest hope for me at some future time? the least chance of your\nhaving some faith in me, to enable me to strive to win you as I long to\ndo?\"\n\nHe had made an error, and saw it before he had finished his sentence.\n\"Forget Miss Bennet?\" repeated Georgiana, with a flash of angry pride,\nas she walked away from him. \"I do not think you understand _me_, Mr.\nPrice. When I have desired a friend's happiness so long, I cannot\nlightly see it thrown away, and never, never would I seek it for my own\nif it was to be at the expense of hers.\"\n\nWilliam, on hearing this, made a quick pace forward to intercept her,\nand, turning, so that they stood face to face, he asked in quieter, but\nnot less ardent tones: \"Only one word more, Miss Darcy. Forgive me for\nwhat I said, but tell me this. You spoke of happiness. Did you mean that\nit might be happiness to you, if all this were cleared up? Did you mean\nthat I might be able to make you happy, and that there was any\npossibility of your ever coming to feel for me even the smallest part of\nwhat I feel for you?\"\n\nGeorgiana, trembling, almost weeping, her anger not subsided, but other\nsensations surging strongly up, brought herself to look for one moment\ninto the eyes of glowing entreaty bent upon hers. With almost a sob, she\nbroke away from him, exclaiming: \"No, no; it is of no use to ask me. Do\nnot talk to me in such a way--I must not--I will not listen--I cannot\nbear it,\" and fairly ran out of the gallery.\n\nWilliam stood stunned and motionless for some minutes. At last he roused\nhimself, with a deep sigh, from the contemplation of his ruined hopes,\nand strove to think of what he ought to do next. While desiring nothing\nso much as solitude and quiet, he remembered that Georgiana would not\nhave gone straight back to the ball-room, and for the two of them to be\nabsent would give rise to remark. To protect Georgiana was an instinct,\nand it gave him a ray of satisfaction in the midst of his perplexity and\nmisery to remind himself that though she had refused his love, she now\nknew of its existence, and whatever misapprehension there might be as to\nthe past, she would perceive what influence guided his actions in the\nfuture. He slowly descended the stairs, so bewildered still as scarcely\nto be conscious of what was going on around him; rehearsing their\nconversation and thinking too late of things he might have said, which\nwould perhaps have been of some service to his cause. A crowd of persons\nwere streaming into the hall from the ball-room, the second dance since\nhe and Georgiana went upstairs having just ended, and supper being now\ntalked of. He mingled with the rest, and presently manoeuvred himself\ninto a place near Mrs. Bingley, who was now sitting with Mr. Ferrars,\nand greeted him with a pleasant smile.\n\nBeyond a casual inquiry as to whether he had seen Kitty, she asked him\nno questions, and before long he found himself introduced to a young\nlady, and directed to find a place for her at one of the supper tables.\nWhat he talked of he did not know, and the rest of the evening passed in\nthe same dreamlike manner. In his desire to attract no special\nattention, he chatted and laughed and danced, and was persuaded that he\ndid so as gaily as before, but he could not keep his thoughts from\nwandering to Georgiana, whom he had seen returning, looking very pale,\nabout a quarter of an hour after they had parted, or to Kitty, whose\neyes continually and anxiously sought his. It was far more painful for\nhim to see her than Georgiana, whom of course he held blameless, even\nfor her hard words; Kitty he vaguely felt to be in part responsible for\nthe whole trouble, and though bitterly reproaching himself for folly and\nblindness, he could not bring himself to go near her, to speak to her,\nor dance with her again, when such a construction had been put upon all\ntheir previous intercourse.\n\nAngry at the pain he was giving her, and driven to despair at the sight\nof Georgiana's pale cheeks, he found the length of the evening almost\nunendurable, and the only relief he obtained was in going to Mr.\nBingley, and asking him to fix as early as possible an hour for their\nstart on the following morning, for it would be necessary for him and\nhis cousin to be well on their long journey towards Mansfield by the\nafternoon. It had been already arranged that the three gentlemen should\nreturn to Desborough independently of Mrs. and Miss Bingley, who were to\nremain at Pemberley for another day or two to recover from the fatigues\nof the ball. Mr. Bingley good-naturedly agreed, judging that the young\npeople had decided that it would be better to make their adieux the\nnight before, rather than come down early to a painful scene of parting\nat the prosaic breakfast-table, so he went away to consult Darcy, and\nsend out orders to the stables. This done, William felt more\ncomfortable; inaction was intolerable to him, and he would have removed\nhimself from the house at once if he could have done so, since to\nrelieve her of a presence which had become embarrassing and distasteful\nto her was the only thing he could now do for Georgiana.\n\nShe had, as he anticipated, sought the refuge of her own room when she\nfled from the gallery; but even there the old habits of self-command and\nconsideration for others prevailed over the longing to give way to her\ngrief and distress of the mind. She knew she must not allow herself the\nluxury of a burst of tears, nor even a little quiet thought, in order to\nrealize what had occurred, and decide what, if anything, she should say\nto Kitty. No, there was no time for that, there would be plenty of\nopportunity soon, to readjust their view of recent events, and all that\nthey meant to Kitty and herself. Shaken and unnerved by the shock of\nWilliam Price's declaration, Georgiana shrank from immediately facing\nits consequences. She could only take a few moments in which to compose\nherself and endeavour to smooth away the traces of emotion. That she\nmust see him again was a dreadful thought, but it would be a far worse\nordeal to have to encounter Kitty's inquiries and lamentations on the\nfollowing day, and the surprise of Elizabeth and Jane. Georgiana dared\nnot let herself think of all this, when this horrible evening was not\nyet over. She hastily bathed her face, and opening the windows wide,\nleaned out for a few minutes, for the night air to cool her throbbing\ntemples, and went down at last, feeling as if her countenance must\nbetray to every observer the secret of what had happened.\n\nShe took refuge at once by the side of Elizabeth, who made room for her\nwith a smile, and did not fail to notice her aspect. As soon as she was\nat liberty, she asked Georgiana if she was very tired, and took care\nthat she was provided with some refreshment. Georgiana owned to a good\ndeal of fatigue, but declared that she should sleep it off, and\nElizabeth, who thought her lassitude partly attributable to some worry\nabout Kitty, told her that she might slip away to bed as soon as she\nchose, and that Kitty must not come into her room for one of their long\nconversations; they must wait till to-morrow to talk over the ball. Poor\nGeorgiana assented with a grateful glance, but had difficulty in\nrestraining her tears, as she thought how little Elizabeth dreamt that\ninterview with Kitty could be a thing to be dreaded, not welcomed.\n\nAfter supper, she could not, for fear of making herself conspicuous,\navoid one or two invitations to dance; but she was truly glad when\nColonel Fitzwilliam, on a hint from Elizabeth, approached her, and said:\n\"Let me take you to a seat in the library, Georgiana. I fear you are\ntired, and you will be able to rest quietly there, and not say one word\nto me unless you please--we are old enough friends for that, I should\nthink.\"\n\nThere were but few persons in the large library, at one end of which a\ntable had been set out, where servants dispensed tea and coffee during\nthe evening, and the cousins placed themselves on a leather-covered\ncouch near the fire at the opposite end. True to his undertaking,\nColonel Fitzwilliam remained silent after he had established his cousin\nin comfort, and screened the blaze from her face; but after a few\nminutes, Georgiana roused herself, thinking anything better than being\nleft to her own reflections, and suddenly recollecting a thing that she\nhad intended to tell Elizabeth, had she been able to see her alone\nduring the day, and deciding that there could be no harm in\ncommunicating it to Colonel Fitzwilliam herself, she mentioned having\nlearnt the fact of Mr. Bertram's acquaintance with Miss Crawford, and\nasked if her cousin happened to know it.\n\nHe admitted himself informed, but expressed interest, as he himself had\nnot discussed it with Mr. Bertram.\n\nGeorgiana therefore ventured to give him Mr. Bertram's description of\nher, and pointed out rather timidly that it seemed to agree entirely\nwith what they already knew and had heard.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Colonel Fitzwilliam thoughtfully; and after a pause, he\nadded: \"I am glad he spoke so well of her--glad she had an advocate in\nhim, for, as you may have gathered from what he dropped with regard to\nher brother, it would not be surprising if the Bertram family were a\nlittle prejudiced against all the Crawfords. I am glad that he, at\nleast, has the manliness to award blame only where blame is due.\"\n\nGeorgiana listened attentively, half expecting that her cousin would go\non to explain the nature of the prejudice against the Crawfords, which\nhad clearly done Miss Crawford so much harm; but he did not, so after a\nlittle she hazarded the remark: \"He did not seem to know anything about\nher of late years, so I thought it useless to ask about her marriage.\"\n\n\"You were right; it would have been useless,\" said the Colonel.\n\"Elizabeth, I know, troubles herself a good deal about not having heard\nany particulars, but doubtless the world will be informed all in good\ntime, and when there is any news, one may expect it will penetrate even\nto Derbyshire.\" He smiled as he spoke, but it was not a cheerful smile,\nand his voice had the ring of something very like bitterness.\nGeorgiana's heart ached for him; she felt that never before had she\nknown what a disappointment could be.\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam talked of other things, until they were interrupted\nby Tom Bertram, who came hurrying in search of them to ask Miss Darcy to\ndance with him again. \"Miss Darcy--so sorry you are tired, but you\npositively must allow me just these two. People are beginning to go,\nactually! and, you know, when that happens, a ball always begins to lose\nsome of its spirit. Besides, who knows when we shall have another such a\ndelightful evening as this again? I have been telling Mr. and Mrs.\nBingley I can never sufficiently thank them for having brought me here.\"\nGeorgiana suffered him to lead her to the dance, and to go on talking,\nfor she was quite unequal to arguing with him. At the conclusion of the\ntwo dances, Elizabeth, who had been watching her, came up and asked her\nif she would not like to retire at once, and fortified by this\npermission, Georgiana turned to say good-night to her partner, whose\nprotests against her disappearance were as strong as the polite Tom\nBertram could make them.\n\n\"Why, Miss Darcy, if you remove yourself, the ball may as well break up;\nand it is really cruel to make me say good-night, when it is good-bye as\nwell.\"\n\n\"Is it? Do you start so early to-morrow? I am very sorry,\" said\nGeorgiana, with an effort at the cordiality which seemed expected of\nher.\n\n\"We do, indeed; some wild idea of my cousin's, I fancy, that it will\ntake us all day to get to Mansfield, even going round Desborough to meet\nthe curricle. It will not; but Mr. Bingley has just informed me that\nWilliam wishes to start not a moment later than eight, and you ladies, I\nfear, are not likely to be on the scene at such an unearthly hour?\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said Elizabeth, \"after such dissipations as charades and a\nball, it will be remarkable if any of us are able to leave our rooms for\na week. You do not realize what quiet people we are here ordinarily, Mr.\nBertram.\" She chatted on, and under cover of it, Georgiana managed to\nsay a brief adieu and glide away. Could she avoid seeing Mr. Price\nagain? No! he was standing by the foot of the stairs; he seemed to be\nwatching for her; there was no escape. Her head was averted, and her\nfoot placed on the lowest step, when he started forward, and not\noffering to shake hands, but in a low voice and a look of intense\nearnestness, he said: \"May I say good-bye to you, Miss Darcy?\"\n\nGeorgiana hardly knew if her \"Good-bye, Mr. Price,\" was audible; but he\nbowed, and stepped back, his eyes following her as she went up the\nstairs.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXI\n\n\nIn the gloom of the following morning, at an hour which seemed\nexceptionally cheerless by reason of the mist and fine rain which\nprevailed, Mr. Bingley's chaise drove round to the front entrance of\nPemberley. Kitty, who, after a night of weeping and wretchedness, had\nfallen into a doze, was aroused by the sound of movements and voices,\nbut when she peeped through her curtains, she was too late for anything\nbut a heartrending glimpse of the skirts of William Price's great-coat,\nas he stepped into the carriage. The door was shut, Darcy and\nFitzwilliam waved their farewells, and the horses moved off at a brisk\ntrot. Kitty watched and listened to them as long as she could, and then\nflung herself on her bed in a paroxysm of grief. Though William's\navoidance of her during the latter part of the previous evening, his\nstrange altered looks, and his embarrassed way of saying good-night, had\nundermined her hopes to such an extent that she had been all night\nfacing the terrible desolation caused by the thought, \"If he does not\ncare for me after all,\" yet she had not actually given all up in\ndespair until the moment of hearing him leave the house. Some note, some\nmessage, might have arrived--might still arrive; but since parting from\nhim, Kitty had not been able to quell the horrible fear that all was\nover. The indications, which had been so favourable, had completely\nchanged since Mrs. Jennings had uttered her foolish remark; in vain had\nshe tried to reinstate her old relations with William Price. What could\nit all mean? Each time she put this question to herself she gave way\nafresh to unrestrained tears, and, weakened by fatigue and emotion, was\ntotally incapable of following out any train of thought or conjecture.\nShe had longed to hasten to Georgiana the night before, to pour out her\nheart in an appeal for the support which Georgiana had never failed to\ngive; but Elizabeth had checked her in this intention; and, poor Kitty,\nunable to bear pain alone with any degree of courage, had worked herself\ninto a deplorable condition by the time her sister arrived at her door\nin the morning.\n\nElizabeth and Jane had naturally both surmised something of the state of\nthings as regarded Kitty. It was not difficult for anyone acquainted\nwith the previous development of the affair, to perceive that William\nPrice had not fulfilled the expectations which had been formed of him,\nand Elizabeth accounted for Georgiana's evident unhappiness by\nconcluding that she had become aware that this would be the case.\nWilliam Price had looked much as usual, up to the last, but Elizabeth\nsuspected that there had been some elucidation either between him and\nGeorgiana, or through Mrs. Jennings, and she hardly knew how much to\nblame him. There was no time to talk matters over with Jane, for she\nfelt, as soon as she was up, that her immediate visit must be to the\nchief sufferer, to comfort and sustain her and, if possible, to shield\nher from the consequences of her own error.\n\nKitty would not admit her at first, and when at length Elizabeth\npersuaded her to do so, she was distressed to see what ravages the shock\nof disappointment and the hours of weeping had wrought. Kitty's tears\nbroke out anew, but the sense of Elizabeth's affection and companionship\nsomewhat soothed her, and when she could speak more coherently, she\nbegged to see Georgiana, who could perhaps tell her things--who would be\nable to explain. This Elizabeth could not permit, for she saw that Kitty\nwas in no fit state to talk over her troubles, but she promised her an\nearly opportunity of doing so, and having induced her to swallow some\nfood and a cordial, she soon had the satisfaction of seeing her fall\nasleep. These precautionary measures were fully justified in the course\nof the next forty-eight hours, during which time Kitty remained really\nill, attacks of strong hysteria alternating with weakness of extreme\nexhaustion. Every care was lavished on her by her two sisters, by\nGeorgiana, and by Elizabeth's maid; but naturally anything like rational\ndiscussion of the cause of her illness was out of the question, and,\nindeed, Kitty herself, after once asking if Mr. Price had left any\nmessage for her, or spoken of returning at some future time, and\nreceiving a negative answer, seemed, after giving way to a torrent of\ntears, unable or unwilling to puzzle matters out any further.\n\nGeorgiana did not escape the inquiries and speculations of Elizabeth and\nJane. When she descended from her room the morning after the ball, at an\nhour little later than her usual one, to take her place in the family\ncircle, she had regained complete control of herself, and declared\nherself entirely refreshed, and beyond a little heaviness of the eyes\nand paleness of cheeks, naturally attributable to the fatigues of the\nlast two days, there was nothing in her aspect to cause remark. No one\nguessed at the sense of guilt which filled her heart when she saw what\ngrief and disappointment had done for Kitty, or at the deep compunction\nand almost unendurable self-reproach which assailed her when the others\ndiscussed his strange defection, and professed themselves unable to\naccount for the curious change in his attitude towards Kitty--a change\nwhich several people had noticed the last hour of the ball. Elizabeth\nand Jane asked her if she was at all prepared for it, whether anything\nhad occurred to make her suspect that Mr. Price would not propose\nmarriage to Kitty after all. These questions were a hard trial to\nGeorgiana, for she could not bear to be other than straightforward, and\nfor a multitude of reasons she could not divulge the true explanation;\nshe could only say in a low, troubled voice, and with as few words as\npossible, that she had learnt, in the course of the evening, that their\nexpectations were mistaken ones, and that she feared Kitty would take it\nvery much to heart.\n\nSeeing her unhappiness on her friend's behalf, the two ladies forbore to\ntease her with further inquiries, though Jane still felt that Georgiana\ncould have thrown more light on the mystery had she cared, and in her\nhearing continually lamented the failure of everything for poor Kitty,\nwho had fallen, as it were, between two stools, the regrettable ending\nto all this pleasant time, and the fickleness of young men, or, rather,\nthe unfortunate complications that arose through their not knowing their\nown minds. Georgiana had to listen to this in silence, though conscious\nthat the last was not an accusation that could fairly be brought against\nWilliam Price, and Elizabeth's more rational way of accounting for\nthings was not much better, when she said that she did not think Mr.\nPrice guilty of more than thoughtlessness, but it was certainly a pity\nthat he had not been able to perceive earlier the extent of Kitty's\nfeeling for him, as no doubt, when he had at last become aware of it, he\nrealized what Elizabeth had already surmised to be in his mind, namely,\nthat his roving life did not warrant him in thinking about matrimony at\npresent. Georgiana thought she might venture to say here that William\nPrice had indeed expressed great sorrow to her on finding that he had\nbeen the cause of disappointment to Kitty, and she even went so far into\nthe dangerous fields of explanation as to add that he had had no\nsuspicion of it until surprised by a chance word of raillery from Mrs.\nJennings. She was pleased to see that this news partly rehabilitated him\nin the mind of Elizabeth, if not of Jane; and for fear of betraying more\nthan she ought, she went away, wondering why she should be glad for him\nnot to be misjudged, when she really ought to be only thinking of how\nwrongly he had behaved.\n\nThe hour of enlightenment for Kitty could not be long postponed. By the\nthird day she was well enough to sit up in a large chair in her own\nroom, and on being visited by Georgiana, begged her to stay for a time,\nand to fasten the door. When assured of their freedom from interruption,\nshe seized her friend's hand, made her sit close beside her, and\nimplored her to relate everything she could that would throw light on\nMr. Price's changed conduct and hasty departure. Georgiana nerved\nherself to reply, but for the first few minutes, Kitty was talking and\ncrying incessantly, pouring out the pent-up grief of the last few days,\nso that Georgiana had great difficulty in calming her, and dreaded the\neffect of the revelation about to be made.\n\n\"Dear Kitty,\" remonstrated Georgiana, \"you must not cry; you must be\nmore composed, or Elizabeth will not let me stay with you. Do try to be\nbrave; think whether it is right to give way so much; you will make\nyourself ill again, you know.\"\n\n\"Anyone would be ill after what I have been through,\" lamented Kitty; \"I\nshall never be happy again. Why does he not care for me? Did he tell you\nwhy not, Georgiana? What have I done, or what has Mrs. Jennings done?\nSomething must have happened to offend him, for he changed all in one\nminute.\"\n\n\"I do not believe anything happened to offend him, Kitty,\" returned\nGeorgiana. \"As he has gone away now and did not do what he all thought\nhe would do, is it not best to assume that he does not care in the way\nwe hoped for, and try to forget about it, and not mind too much? Dear\nKitty, I am deeply grieved for you: it has been my fault, more than\nanyone's, and you are right to reproach me; I can never forgive myself\nfor having led you into the mistake.\"\n\n\"But you are not answering me, Georgiana,\" cried Kitty, with the\npetulance of an invalid; \"of course, I know he does not care, and has\ngone away, but I want to know why he has gone. If it is not for anything\nI have done, he might come back.\"\n\nGeorgiana was silent, and held her down; she shrank still from telling\nKitty that he would not come back. Kitty began again impatiently. \"It is\nfoolish of you to talk about reproaching yourself. It is not more your\nfault than anyone else's; not so much as Mrs. Jennings's, but if he\nspoke to you about it at all, he must have said something, have given\nsome hint. Did he talk to you, Georgiana? You have not told me that\nyet.\"\n\nGeorgiana gave up what hopes she had had of concealing from Kitty what\nwould make the disappointment far more thorough, and crushing, and as\ngently as possible managed to convey the fact of William's confession of\nattachment to herself. She was obliged to say it several times, and in\nlanguage of unmistakable clearness, before Kitty could grasp her\nmeaning; and even then, as she sat crouched on the ground, her face\naverted and her cheeks burning with shame, Kitty, who had drawn her hand\naway, gazed at her in mingled horror and incredulity. In the course of\nthese three days, the notion that Miss Kitty Bennet was _not_ the object\nof William Price's preference had at length penetrated the mind of that\nyoung lady, but that her friend should be the chosen one was a thing\naltogether past comprehension, and the first idea that occurred to her\nwas that there must have been treachery to herself somewhere. Kitty's\nchanges of mood lately had been punctuated by bursts of tears, and this\nwas no exception to the rule, though they were now tears of\nmortification. Her first angry impulse was to pour out words of blame,\naccusing Georgiana of not being satisfied with the attentions of Mr.\nBertram, but requiring those of his cousin too. Georgiana disdained to\nreply to such a taunt, but it needed all her patience, all her\ntenderness, to persuade Kitty out of her bitter frame of mind, and to\nendeavour to heal the wound to the poor girl's vanity, which had indeed\nall through been more deeply involved than her affections, little though\nshe realized it. Combined with a love of importance, and the\nencouragement given by her friends, it had carried her on a wave of\nexcitement through the past months, and had helped to fix her hopes more\nfirmly on William Price than any knowledge of his character, any real\ncongeniality in their natures could have done. But she could not be\naware of all this, and there was no immediate comprehension to make the\ndisappointment less acute.\n\nIt certainly was consoling to feel that everyone else must have been to\nblame, that everybody had been equally deceived; that even Georgiana\nherself had been taken by surprise, and was now heaping upon herself the\nseverest reproaches, while she implored Kitty's forgiveness--not, Kitty\ndiscerned in a puzzled way, for having received Mr. Price's proposals,\nbut for having helped to foster the deception which had reacted so\ncruelly upon her friend. Above all, it would have been a relief, having\ndiscovered that Mr. Price must have acted atrociously, to say so, and\nthe more Kitty thought of it, the more she resented his conduct. But\nGeorgiana would not admit this; she would only allow that it was all\nutterly inexplicable, but that they could not judge fairly of Mr. Price,\nnot being able to see his point of view, and that if that was clear to\nthem, she was sure that he would be found to have acted honestly all the\nway through.\n\nKitty immediately suspected that Georgiana had been won round to the\nsaid point of view, and began to question her closely as to what had\npassed between them; but Georgiana indignantly repudiated the\nsuggestion, and assured Kitty, in a manner that forbade further\ndiscussion, that she had decidedly refused Mr. Price, refused even to\nlisten to him, and had not the slightest expectation of ever seeing or\nhearing from him again. She added, that she had refrained from telling\nElizabeth, or any of the others, about Mr. Price's offer, and thought it\nwould be best if Kitty decided to do the same, to which, as she had\nexpected, Kitty willingly agreed.\n\nNothing, in fact, could have suited Kitty better, in the circumstances,\nthan a compact of silence. At the end of their long conversation, when\nGeorgiana left her, by far the more exhausted in spirits of the two, she\nhad begun to have some of the sensations of an injured heroine, and it\nwas much more satisfactory to consider herself badly treated--to have\nbeen jilted, to all intents and purposes, than if it came to be known\nthat she had been all the time in love with the wrong man, in which case\nher position would be shorn of much of its dignity. Her sisters'\nsympathy was very acceptable to her, and when Jane invited her to return\nwith her to Desborough for a time, she gladly promised to do so, knowing\nthat it would not at first be at all comfortable to remain with\nGeorgiana, the one person who knew the whole story. It was therefore\narranged that Jane and Miss Bingley should defer their journey for two\ndays more, when it was hoped she would be quite equal to travelling with\nthem.\n\nThe only drawback to the plan, as far as she was concerned, was Miss\nBingley's presence for another fortnight at Desborough. That lady had\nnot troubled herself to make any conjectures with regard to William\nPrice's departure, but frankly told Jane and Georgiana that it was\nexactly what she had expected. She at least had never been misled; she\nhad never supposed Mr. Price to be in love with Miss Bennet or anyone\nelse. She could not imagine why they had all persuaded themselves of it.\nNothing was clearer than that he was a young man quite heart-whole. Jane\nprotested, but Georgiana made no comment, only begging her friend\nprivately not to refer to the subject in Kitty's hearing.\n\nThe day arrived, Mr. Bingley's carriage again drove to the door, and the\nthree ladies took their seats in it, Kitty's farewell glance being given\ntowards the spot where she had last seen William Price. With their\ngoing, the whole episode seemed to be finally closed, and Georgiana\nturned to re-enter the house, and to take up the duties of a life which,\nin one short week, seemed to have been robbed of almost all its\nbrightness. She had been making an unsuccessful struggle against low\nspirits, ever since the ill-omened day of the ball, and being unable to\ndismiss, had tried hard to account for, the strange sense of depression,\nof loneliness, and loss, which assailed her continually. It was not only\nsorrow for Kitty's disappointment, or regret for her own share in it,\nnor was it the estrangement that had arisen between them; no, it was not\na vision of Kitty that so constantly obtruded itself upon her thoughts,\nbut of a very different person, one whose ardent looks and words\ninsisted on being remembered, whose voice she seemed to hear again\npleading for what she dared not give. Every detail of their conversation\nin the gallery crowded upon Georgiana's memory, once she had made her\nconfession to Kitty, and would admit these thoughts; they would not be\ndenied, as she had denied him a hearing, but came back to her with a\nvivid clearness and an irresistible appeal.\n\nShe remembered how he had described the beginnings and the growth of his\nattachment to her, and looking back over the course of their\nacquaintance, countless incidents stood out, to verify all he had said.\nWhen no longer viewed through Kitty's illusions, every one of their\nmeetings and conversations was seen in its true light, consolidating\ntheir friendship, giving each an insight into the other's character. Why\nwas it such a joy, though an indescribably painful one, to recall these\nthings, to live again through the moments spent in the gallery?\nGeorgiana's heart answered her, and she felt that the answer must always\nhave been there, though she had only just awakened to it. It was a joy\nbecause everything connected with William Price must be a joy to her,\nhimself, his nobleness, his true worth, and the knowledge that he cared\nfor her, but it was pain, because, sweet though it was to hear what he\nhad to tell her, it was a disloyalty to her friend to listen, the friend\nwhose life had perhaps been spoilt by their mistake. How could she ever\nthink of being happy as long as that friend suffered? For despite her\ngrief at the thought that she had lost him for ever, that she had\nrefused his love and he would never know now that she loved him in\nreturn, yet Georgiana felt that she could not have acted differently.\nEven had she known at the moment he spoke, what he was to her, she could\nnot have been so traitorous as to take what Kitty longed for, from under\nher very eyes; and she was glad that Kitty did not guess at the extent\nof the sacrifice.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXII\n\n\nThe departure of the ladies for Desborough left a small party at\nPemberley, for several days previously Colonel Fitzwilliam had gone with\nhis horses to Leicestershire, and good accounts of the hunting prospects\nhad been received from him. The Darcys were not, however, to remain for\nlong alone, for the arrival of Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford had been\nfixed for a date early in the following week. Elizabeth delayed no\nfurther in preparing Georgiana for their visit, and at same time\ncommunicated to her the fact which she had learnt from Mrs. Wentworth,\nof Miss Crawford's not being engaged to Sir Walter Elliot. Georgiana\nlistened with the greatest interest, and joined warmly in the expression\nof Elizabeth's hopes that Colonel Fitzwilliam might yet be made happy,\nalthough for the present there was nothing to be done but to try to make\nMiss Crawford feel at home and comfortable among them all.\n\n\"I shall confine my efforts solely to that,\" said Elizabeth laughingly.\n\"It would be useless as well as dangerous to attempt any further\nmatchmaking until we know the extent of feeling on _both_ sides, for\nthat want of that knowledge has made us singularly unsuccessful lately,\nhas it not, Georgiana?\"\n\nGeorgiana assented but could not smile; for just then only the tragical\nside of unrequited love was turned towards her. A brief letter of thanks\nhad been received by his hostess from William Price, saying all that was\nnecessary in a matter simple and sincere, and closing with a message of\n\"greetings and remembrance to all your family.\" Georgiana's cheeks\nburned as she handed it back, and she was glad to turn away, and take\nher little niece upon her lap, while Darcy, glancing over the letter,\nsaid: \"He seems an agreeable, manly young fellow, from what I saw of\nhim; I should be sorry to think he would treat a girl ill.\"\n\n\"A girl's fancy does not always keep pace with common-sense, in such a\ncase as the one you speak of,\" said his wife. \"And as I told you, I do\nnot think Kitty was very wisely counselled from the first.\"\n\n\"Probably not,\" said Darcy, \"a young man at his age and in his\nprofession is likely to flutter the dovecotes quite unconsciously. But\nthere was something so frank and pleasing about him that one would wish\nto believe him thoroughly estimable.\"\n\nGeorgiana, through the little one's chatter, heard these words with\ndelight; that William Price should have gained her brother's good\nopinion was a source of rejoicing, even though that advantage might now\navail him nothing.\n\nMiss Crawford looked very thin and ill when she arrived, and the first\npart of her visit passed very quietly. She spent the chief of her time\nin her own rooms, descending only to join the family at dinner and\nduring the evening, and when not talking to Elizabeth, seemed to find\nher greatest pleasure in listening to Georgiana's music. Mrs. Grant\nwatched over her with unremitting solicitude, but by no means treated\nher as a sick person, evidently desiring that she should rouse herself,\ntake an interest in things around her, and make whatever exertion she\nfelt equal to. The tranquility of the life exactly suited her, and\nbefore many days an improvement in her health and spirits became\nnoticeable. She was able to take drives in the mildest part of the day,\nor go for short walks through the pleasure grounds when the frosts of\nDecember came in, and the mornings were bright and invigorating. The\nbeauty of the country around, the healthiness of the air, and the quiet\nkindness of her host and hostess, gradually had their effect upon a\ntroubled mind and a weakened body; and Colonel Fitzwilliam's name was\nbarely mentioned, Lady Catherine de Bourgh's never.\n\nOne morning, when Georgiana and Mrs. Grant had walked down to the\nRectory, Elizabeth was sitting with her guest, and with the view of\nentertaining her, gave her a description of the charades, not omitting\nthe energetic part played by Mr. Bertram in organizing them. Mary's\ncolour changed a little on first hearing his name, but she gave all her\nattention to the recital, and it was not until some minutes later, when\nsilence had fallen between them, that she said suddenly: \"I wonder if\nMr. Bertram or Mr. Price spoke of me to you, Mrs. Darcy. Were you aware\nthat I knew them both?\"\n\nElizabeth replied that she had heard from Georgiana of Mr. Price's\nacquaintance with Miss Crawford, but of Mr. Bertram's she had not known,\nthe subject never having been approached while the young men were\nthere.\n\n\"I thought not,\" said Miss Crawford, and after a moment's pause she\nadded, colouring slightly: \"I have had too much experience of your\nkindness to think that you would treat me differently if you did know\nthe whole circumstances; nevertheless, I felt sure that you did not, and\nI made up my mind before I came here, that I would not be any further\nindebted to you while you remained in ignorance. Each day I have been\nexpecting you to ask me some question about the reason for Lady\nCatherine's hostility to us, for you were fully entitled to an\nexplanation after the kind and generous way in which you wrote to me,\nand which I fear I acknowledged so inadequately.\" She stopped, emotion\nand weakness depriving her momentarily of speech, and Elizabeth, who had\nbeen endeavouring to check her, took hold of her hand, and with the\nutmost gentleness begged her not to continue and not to agitate herself.\n\n\"Dear Miss Crawford, I am entitled to no explanation, and I do not wish\nfor one. It is you who ought to receive the fullest apologies of the\nwhole family for my aunt's conduct to you. My cousin told us all that\nhappened that evening after we left, and, as I told you in my letter, I\ncan never be sufficiently ashamed and grieved on account of what you\nwere subjected to. If you can forgive us, do not let us revive the\nsubject; it is painful to us both.\"\n\nMiss Crawford indicated that she wished to be allowed to speak, and\nafter a few moments spent in recovering herself, she went on in a low\nvoice, and looking away from Elizabeth: \"I did not mean to refer to that\npart of it, and least of all with you, whose goodness has almost\nobliterated it from my mind. I mean the reason for Lady Catherine's\nattack. You must have surmised that there was some cause for it; she\nmust have told you that she had heard something to my detriment, or, at\nall events, you have gathered that something of the kind exists? It is\nthat that I wish to make clear; I feel that I owe it to you to tell you\nexactly, as far as they concern myself, what things are said about me,\nin order that when you hear them from others, you may be able to\nseparate the true from the false. For some of them are true, you know;\nthat is the unfortunate part of it.\" As she concluded, she glanced at\nElizabeth with an attempt at a smile, though her hands were trembling.\n\nElizabeth attempted to calm and reassure her. \"There is no need for you\nto tell me anything if you do not feel equal to the effort,\" she said.\n\"I think I do already know the greater part of the story, and I can\nassure you that we have never believed the smallest thing\ndisadvantageous to yourself. I had heard enough of it before Mr. Yates\nappeared to be convinced that you were the person injured and misjudged,\nand that a maliciously distorted version of events was poured down my\naunt's ears. I shall be very happy if some day you will give me your\nconfidence, but I fear it might do you harm to talk of it just now, and\nrecall things in which persons you cared for were involved?\"\n\nElizabeth's manner was so kind, that Mary was glad to allow herself to\nbe persuaded, and lay back on her sofa murmuring: \"Yes, you are right,\"\nlooking at the same time tired and relieved. She presently added, with a\nlittle more brightness: \"I am glad you know, and that you do not think\nme such a monster as Lady Catherine described.\"\n\n\"I never thought you were a monster, my dear Miss Crawford,\" assured\nElizabeth, smiling and studying her guest's countenance while her own\nmind was busy. Miss Crawford's definitely, if laughingly expressed\ndesire to be reinstated in the good opinion of Mrs. Darcy, probably\nincluded in its object the rest of the family; and, if so, then in spite\nof their abrupt separation at Bath, in spite of all that had happened\nsince in London, Colonel Fitzwilliam must be among the number. Elizabeth\nfelt as if she were groping in the dark, for she had no clue to Miss\nCrawford's present feelings towards him; but though she had not intended\nto speak of him yet, this was at least an opportunity of discovering\nwhether they were feelings of goodwill. She accordingly said, as if\ncontinuing the same train of thought: \"My cousin was so glad that he had\nhappened to remain behind us, and could therefore attempt to do\nsomething, even though it was but little, to remedy the evil caused by\nthose objectionable Ferrars.\"\n\nMary started and changed her position, and Elizabeth, though not looking\ndirectly at her, could perceive a variety of expressions pass across her\nface. She did not answer immediately, and her reply, when uttered: \"It\nwas very kind of Colonel Fitzwilliam,\" sounded cold and reserved.\n\n\"I do not regard it as kindness,\" said Elizabeth; \"his regard for you\nand his indignation on your behalf made him anxious to do far more. He\ntold me that he bitterly regretted having left you that evening, after\nwe had gone away. If he had stayed near you, he could have prevented\nmuch that followed.\"\n\nAgain Mary took some time to reply, and when she did, to Elizabeth's\nsurprise, it was with more than a touch of scornfulness. \"Colonel\nFitzwilliam has a great power of self-effacement, has he not? He must\nhave practiced the art of disappearing unexpectedly, with as little\nwarning as the magician in the fairy stories.\"\n\n\"But does he so?\" asked Elizabeth, whose astonishment increased. \"I had\nnot noticed it. We think him generally a staid and sober person, who\ndoes things with even more than the usual amount of consideration. Did\nhe not return--did you not see him that evening at my aunt's?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, that evening,\" said Mary. \"I believe he did see us to the\ncarriage; I was not thinking so much of that occasion. But in London--I\nsaw him once or twice, and he talked as if he were going to remain, and\nthen he vanished as if the earth had swallowed him. Of course, it did\nnot matter; he had only himself to please; but I heard several people\nremark on it.\"\n\nElizabeth pondered, and to gain time inquired: \"Did he speak as though\nhe hoped to see you again while he was there?\"\n\n\"Yes--at least we thought so; my sister and I may have misunderstood, or\nhe may have meant nothing; people can hardly be expected to account for\nall their sudden freaks, can they?\" replied Mary, speaking with an\nindifference so marked that her companion could not help fancying it was\nassumed. Elizabeth hesitated no longer, and was about to speak, with the\nintention of telling Miss Crawford why Colonel Fitzwilliam had left town\nso suddenly, when the door opened to admit Mrs. Grant and Georgiana, so\nthat she was obliged to postpone the communication till some future\ntime, and to leave matters in a state which more than ever seemed to\nneed elucidation.\n\nThe opportunity, however, was long in coming. After their half-finished\ntalk, Mary Crawford appeared to avoid being alone with her hostess. She\ncame downstairs more, and gradually began to live almost entirely with\nthe rest of the family, but constantly kept close to her sister and\nGeorgiana on various pretexts. The latter did not venture to speak to\nher of Colonel Fitzwilliam, but Mary was not long in discovering that\nthe name of William Price was a welcome one to her young friend, and\nseeing that Georgiana wished to _hear_, without having to _ask_, Mary\ntold all she knew of his youth, his family and his past career,\ndescanting on his charm and his fine qualities of character, while\nGeorgiana sat in silence, her downcast eyes and glowing cheeks alone\nbetraying the interest which the subject had for her. Mary guessed at\nthe meaning of it all, but considerately said no word to arouse\nGeorgiana's self-consciousness, and their friendship grew almost\nunawares, neither knowing how much each thought of, and would have liked\nto help, the other.\n\nIt was not until nearly a week after the subject had first been broached\nthat Elizabeth found it possible to renew it, and then only by\ndeliberately engaging the attention of Miss Crawford, in inviting her to\nwalk with her one morning along the high road. Darcy had driven with\nMrs. Grant and Georgiana to a distant part of the estate, and it had\nbeen proposed that the other two ladies should come to meet them on\ntheir return, so that Miss Crawford could take a seat in the barouche\nshould she feel tired. It was such a beautiful morning, crisp, cold and\nbright, that Mrs. Grant over-ruled the objections which her sister was\nbeginning to make, and assured her that a brisk walk in such weather\ncould do her nothing but good. Elizabeth half suspected that she would\nstill find some way of avoiding the expedition, but when twelve o'clock\narrived, Miss Crawford descended into the hall, saying smilingly: \"All\nready, you see, Mrs. Darcy. Don't you think I am the most obedient\npatient you ever saw? At this rate, you will soon be able to send me\naway a complete cure.\"\n\n\"I hardly think of you as a patient now, and still less do I think of\nsending you away,\" returned Elizabeth, as they emerged from the house.\n\"Mr. Darcy and I should be sadly disappointed if you left us directly\nyou were well enough to do so.\"\n\n\"You are always so kind,\" said Miss Crawford. \"But I fear our visit must\ncome to an end soon, as it is less than a fortnight to Christmas, and\nyou will probably be having a large family party for the occasion.\"\n\nSuch a remark could only be interpreted in one way, and Elizabeth, after\nreiterating her hope that Miss Crawford and Mrs. Grant would make a long\nstay, and assuring her guest that their numbers at Christmas would be\nthe same as at present, went on almost immediately: \"The other day we\nwere speaking of Colonel Fitzwilliam's sudden departure from London, and\nI wanted to tell you, if it is not tiresome to you to hear, what I\nbelieve to have been the reason for it. I am so anxious he should not be\nmisunderstood, or thought capricious.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Darcy, I did not seem to imply he was. I am sure he has the\nbest of reasons for what he does, and anyhow, they are no business of\nmine.\"\n\nElizabeth would not let the subject be dismissed, and continued very\ngently: \"He had good reasons in this case, and I hope very much you will\nnot dislike my mentioning them, as they concern you. He left London\nbecause he cared for you, and had just heard, on what he believed to be\nunimpeachable authority, that you were engaged to another man. The news\nwas such a blow to him that he could not endure to stay where he might\npossibly meet you again.\"\n\nThere was a short pause; Mary grew crimson, uttered an exclamation, and\nthen, controlling herself with an effort, said in tones of suppressed\nanger: \"If Colonel Fitzwilliam told you that, Mrs. Darcy, he is\ndeceiving you and himself. It would be much better to admit candidly\nthat when he saw me again in London he did not care for me as much as he\nhad thought, instead of making my supposed engagement an excuse for his\ndisappearance.\"\n\nElizabeth stood still for a moment, completely taken aback by this\nversion of affairs, and could only exclaim: \"Miss Crawford!\"\n\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon; I know I ought not to speak to you, who are his\nrelative,\" said Mary, walking on with quick impetuous steps. \"Pray\nforgive me, Mrs. Darcy; I know _you_ are true, who ever else is not. But\nyou cannot guess how hard it is to be accused of sending a person away\nbefore they have even approached one; to be blamed for causing trouble\nwhen one has never been a free agent, and when the trouble has all\nreacted upon one's self.\"\n\n\"I would not blame you for the world,\" said Elizabeth. \"You must\nremember I know but little of the facts, and nothing at all of how they\nappear from the other side. My principal object, as I have said, is to\nprevent my cousin from being misjudged, not to make any accusations\nagainst anyone; will you not tell me a little more, so that between us\nwe may clear the whole matter up?\"\n\nElizabeth was obliged to proceed with the utmost caution, and to speak\nless openly than she would have wished, for instinct warned her that\nMiss Crawford was not yet ready to be guided, or even sympathized with.\nIt was far too soon to assume any special interest on her part in\nColonel Fitzwilliam, though her last speech had admitted the existence\nof a trouble not unconnected to him.\n\n\"There is really nothing to tell you, Mrs. Darcy,\" said Miss Crawford.\n\"What happened is simply a succession of negatives. Colonel Fitzwilliam\nreappeared in London, and showed every sign of wishing to renew his\nfriendship with my sister and me, but he departed without doing so. I\nwas not engaged to anyone at that time, nor have I been since, as he\nmight have easily found out if he had asked the right people.\"\n\n\"Miss Crawford!\" cried Elizabeth earnestly; \"he _had_ reason to believe\nit. Perhaps he did not ask your nearest relatives, but you are surely\naware--it involves no reproach to yourself--but it was talked of, and\nassumed to be a fact, among your friends generally?\"\n\nMary evidently found it difficult to reply, but at length said: \"Yes, I\nknow it was talked of, but there was never any truth in it. I know I was\nfoolish. I went about a great deal with those people--with the Elliots;\nI let myself be drawn into their circle, and I suppose it was pleasant\nto be f\u00c3\u00aated and made much of; Mrs. Darcy, I daresay you hardly know what\nit is to drift into an intimacy that amuses you, and occupies your time,\nwhile your heart is never in it the smallest degree.\"\n\n\"I think I understand,\" said Elizabeth gently. \"You had been with them\nat Bath, and it was difficult to free yourself from the association when\nyou met again?\"\n\n\"Yes, and my brother liked them--or they liked him--and it is always\nnatural for me to be where he is. But I was not bound to them, and it\nwas not all enjoyment. How often I wished that something would happen to\ntake me out of it! How gladly would I not have gone!\"\n\n\"My cousin hoped, I think, to have made some arrangements with you and\nyour sister, but he was not sure if they would be acceptable.\"\n\n\"Colonel Fitzwilliam did not put himself to much trouble about it,\"\nreturned Mary. \"The extent of his plans was, that he asked permission to\ncome and call, and then did not do so.\"\n\n\"Because he had heard in the meantime of your engagement,\" said\nElizabeth. \"Dear Miss Crawford, you must, you must, indeed, let me\nconvince you of his sincerity. He cared for you in Bath; you know he did\nfor he told your sister so.\" She looked anxiously at Mary, and received\na glance of reluctant assent. \"No one more deeply lamented the\nmisfortune which separated you after that; and can you wonder that, when\nyou meet again, the remembrance of what happened made him diffident as\nto his reception, and uncertain of the place he still might hold in your\nesteem? But he was as devoted to you as ever, and only longed for a\nchance of showing it. Oh!\"--Elizabeth broke off impatiently, but smiling\nat herself--\"I ought not to be saying this to you in these cold, bald\nwords; I cannot plead his case as eloquently as he could; but at least I\ncan implore you to believe in him. Grant that he acted with\nover-caution, and did not consult his own best interests: he was afraid\nof precipitating matters by speaking before he could divine what you\nfelt for him. But that his affection was there, I know positively. A man\nwho had cared less would have stayed, would have pretended indifference,\nand would have congratulated you on your engagement.\"\n\n\"I wish he had,\" said Miss Crawford, trying to smile, though the tears\nfilled her eyes, \"for then I could have told him of his mistake, and\nasked him why he was in such a hurry to credit it.\"\n\n\"I do not think he was in a hurry,\" said Elizabeth sadly; \"he would not\nhave believed it if he could have helped it, and if you could see him\nnow, you would know what real grief can do for a man of his nature.\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" said Miss Crawford, without much warmth, but a moment\nlater she exclaimed: \"Yes, it is bad for a man to bring unhappiness on\nhimself through an error, but I suppose it never occurred to him that by\ngoing off in that way, without a word, he might be leaving the same\nthing for someone else. If I were a man, I would never accept my\ndismissal except from the woman herself; I would at least have the\ncourage to put my fate to the touch.\"\n\nElizabeth weighed these words for an instant, and then turning to look\nin her companion's face, she said: \"I want to ask you one thing, but you\nneed not reply if you do not wish. If my cousin had put his fate to the\ntouch while he was in London, would he have had the answer, or any hope\nof answer, that he desired?\"\n\nMary coloured deeply, but did not turn her eyes away from Mrs. Darcy's.\n\"It is hardly fair, is it, to ask me a question which he has never\nasked?\" she said, with a slight smile. \"But it is useless to try to keep\nsecrets from such a friend as yourself, and I suppose you are answered\nby now.\"\n\nThey stopped with one accord beside a gate, and stood looking over the\nlong furrows of brown earth in the field, but neither seeing them. Miss\nCrawford's blush remained, and her lips were set rather defiantly, when\nElizabeth turned to her and said with great earnestness: \"I said that\nColonel Fitzwilliam was not coming back before Christmas, and that is\nquite true, but may I not tell him to come? I will do nothing without\nyour permission; will not even say that you are here; but will you not\ngive him leave to come, and speak for himself, and try to atone for the\nmistakes and unhappiness of the past? Indeed, though at this moment he\nhas no hope of it, I know that he would ask no greater privilege.\"\n\nMary laid her hand on her friend's, and replied affectionately, but\nwithout any hesitation: \"No, no, Mrs. Darcy, do not tell him to come. I\nthought you would suggest something of the kind, but I would much rather\nnot. It would be no kindness to either of us.\" Then, as Elizabeth still\nlooked questioningly at her, she continued: \"I really mean it. Since we\nare to be quite frank, I did feel very much what I thought to be Colonel\nFitzwilliam's defection, and Frances would tell you that that accounts\nfor my stupid ill-health this autumn; I do not quite agree, but none the\nless, I am confident that we had better not meet again. It is too late,\nwhen people are getting on towards respectable middle life as we are.\nYou smile, but do you know I am near my thirtieth birthday? No, we have\nboth recovered from the wounds of last summer, and we should be wiser\nnot to risk reopening them.\"\n\n\"It would be a healing, I think, not a reopening,\" said Elizabeth.\n\n\"Do you think so? But one cannot tell. Colonel Fitzwilliam must have\nbeen in love with some ideal person, a Mary Crawford who never really\nexisted, or he would not have been frightened away so easily from the\nactual one. If he were to see me again, there might be a fresh\ndisappointment in store. Does he still think I am to marry Sir Walter\nElliot?\"\n\n\"I do not know. Darcy and I have never told him otherwise.\"\n\n\"Ah, well, do not let him be undeceived; and some day, perhaps in\nLondon, we shall be sent in to dinner together, and imagine his surprise\nand dismay at finding it is plain Miss Crawford, and not Lady Elliot! It\nwill give us something to talk about through the first three courses.\nDear Mrs. Darcy, you look disapprovingly at me, but seriously, I do\nthink, if we ever are to meet, it will be best to do so by accident. I\ncould hardly bear a premeditated encounter as it would be here, each of\nus knowing that we were expected to play a certain part.\"\n\n\"It is better he should not come, of course, if you are not sure whether\nyou could accept him,\" said Elizabeth.\n\n\"That it is; I suppose I am not sure; because, you see, circumstances\nhave combined to make Colonel Fitzwilliam appear in light of a\nhalf-hearted admirer, and though I know from you he is not, yet I have\nno experience of his own powers of recommending himself. Do not be angry\nwith me, or let this spoil our friendship; I am so glad now that you\nknow all, and you will let me come and stay with you sometimes when he\nis away, will you not?\"\n\nA time-honoured custom has ordained that only one reply shall be made to\nan appeal of this kind, and Elizabeth duly assured her friend that it\nshould make no difference; feeling, indeed, that as she had asked for an\nexplanation, she could not resent Miss Crawford's frankness, nor could\nshe like the high-spirited girl less for the glimpse she had given of\nher heart. There was no denying, however, that the end of their\nconversation had been a good deal of a disappointment. Mary's confession\nhad been so much more than Elizabeth had ventured to hope for, that it\nwas melancholy to realize that it came, as she herself had said, too\nlate; too late for Colonel Fitzwilliam to be in any way the gainer by\nit. Many times during the day and the succeeding ones did Elizabeth turn\nover in her mind a series of plans to bring her two friends together\nagain, in some way entirely unforeseen by both; but all had to be\ndiscarded, for Miss Crawford had been so decisive, and it was not\ncertain that the Colonel would make any better use of his chances,\nunless he could be warned of how he had failed previously. The more\nElizabeth pondered over the events of last year, in the new light now\nthrown upon them, the better she was able to understand Mary's point of\nview, and to comprehend that it was not solely Lady Catherine's\ninsulting behaviour, or her cousin's want of self-confidence, or Mary's\nown pride and recklessness, but something of all three, that had ruined\ntheir prospects of happiness; and she mourned sincerely over the wreck\nand the impossibility of restoring it, while they were so obstinately\nresolved to remain strangers to one another. If only Fitzwilliam had\nknown, when in London, that the prize lay so near his hand! that he had\ngained Mary's love, almost without trying to do so, merely by watching\nand waiting, and not submitting to the rebuff she had given him at the\nend of their stay in Bath! But the opportunity had passed, and he had\nlost more ground now than he might ever recover, for Elizabeth knew well\nthat Mary's resentment was the real obstacle: _his_ feelings were\nunaltered, but hers she had striven, perhaps with some measure of\nsuccess, to harden into indifference.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXIII\n\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam wrote that he intended staying in Leicestershire for\nChristmas, and going to London for the first fortnight of January.\nElizabeth did not fail to make this information public, and accordingly,\nwhen the question of their two guests' departure was again broached,\nMiss Crawford was more easily persuaded to prolong their visit, and her\nsister approved of whatever she chose to do. Elizabeth had not thought\nit right to speak to Mrs. Grant about her conversation with Mary, but\nthat lady had opened the subject herself, by expressing to Mrs. Darcy\nher great relief that the affair with Colonel Fitzwilliam had gone off,\nand attributing Mary's illness to fretting and disappointment. Mrs.\nGrant blamed no one except the Elliots, who, she asserted, had\npersistently stood between Mary and her other friends, but she lamented\nthe whole series of mishaps, for it was evident that no one else had\never gained such a large measure of her sister's regard, and now her\nwhole endeavour seemed to be to banish him from her thoughts.\n\nMary meantime was recovering health and vigour, and the colour came back\nto her cheeks, and the light to her eyes in a manner very gratifying to\nher friends to observe. Had Elizabeth not been so much occupied with\nplans for her visitors, and preparations for Christmas, she could not\nhave failed to note the contrast between Miss Crawford and Georgiana,\nfor the younger girl grew paler and graver, and seemed more and more\nspiritless in comparison with Mary's gay moods. Georgiana made great\nefforts to throw herself into what was going on, and was persuaded that\nshe smiled and talked as much as ever, while she took part in the\nhospitalities of Pemberley, but in reality the weight on her mind, her\npreoccupation with the thought of two people who were suffering through\nher fault, prevented her from always knowing when she was silent. She\nconstantly pictured Kitty, grieving in solitude over the downfall of the\nhopes of many months, and wearied her mind with fruitless speculations\nas to how they could have acted differently, in order to have averted\nthe blow. No one could possibly have foreseen that Mr. Price would care\nfor her and not for Kitty! else the latter's friends might have\npersuaded her to try and like Mr. Morland, whose courtship had been\nunder equally auspicious circumstances. But then, Georgiana reflected\nwith a thrill, who could think of a Morland when they had been better\nattracted by a Price! She was glad to be able to pay that tribute to her\nfriend's good taste. And if the affair had not been checked in its early\nstages, it must have gone on in the way it had until the gentleman\nspoke, and poor Kitty's fate was sealed.\n\nTears rose to Georgiana's eyes as she recalled her interview with\nWilliam Price, and the feeling of anger and despair that had come over\nher at the prospect of everything being so utterly wrong, and then\nthrown into such confusion. And since then, the indignation on Kitty's\nbehalf, which had overwhelmed her at first, had softened into pity, and\nshared a place in her heart equally with regret for Mr. Price, for _his_\ndisappointment, as sudden and as complete as Kitty's, and far more\nbewildering. He would never, perhaps, fully understand how it came\nabout, nor fully allow for its causes, and for the obstacle which had\nnecessitated his being refused. Chilled and repulsed, he would think her\ninsensible, unkind; he would believe that she did not care for him, and\ndid not want to care. What a wonder if his feelings towards her\nunderwent a change! What more probable than that now, when she had\nlearnt that his esteem was the only thing necessary to her happiness,\nand earnestly wished he could know that she no longer blamed him, he had\nresolved to think of her no more?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOwing to a slight indisposition of Mrs. Bingley's, the Desborough party\nhad not come over to Pemberley at Christmas, as was their custom, but\nthey arrived on New Year's Eve to spend two or three days. Georgiana\nlooked forward rather nervously to the meeting with Kitty, for the\nlatter had only written occasional notes to her and Elizabeth, in a\nconstrained style, since the departure in November, and Georgiana\ndreaded equally any reopening of the subject in words, or any coldness\nbetween them, combined with the unforgiving reproaches which Kitty knew\nso well how to convey by look and manner. It seemed, however, when they\narrived, that Kitty was not going to adopt either attitude precisely.\nShe looked very thin, and Jane told her sister that she had not been\neating or sleeping well, but she chatted as vigorously as ever, and was\nin restless, excitable spirits. She could not sit long to anything, and\nwhen not flying about the house, or playing with the children, was\nconstantly running down to the Rectory, on the plea of wanting to see\nMrs. Ferrars's new baby, who had made its appearance in the world a few\ndays before. Georgiana found that any private talk was out of the\nquestion, and did not seem to be desired by Kitty, whose principal topic\nof conversation was, after the loveliness of the baby, the charms of her\nnewest friend, a certain Mrs. Henry Tilney, sister of Mr. Morland, who\nhad been staying with him for some weeks. This young lady was about\nKitty's age, but had been married for several years, and had brought one\nof her children with her, a little girl about the age of the Bingleys'\nsecond boy, and there had evidently been a great deal of intercourse\nbetween the Park and the Rectory. Mrs. Tilney was reported by Jane and\nher husband to be a very pleasing, gentle and amiable woman, and Kitty's\nenthusiasm over her knew no bounds.\n\nElizabeth had met Mrs. Tilney, and was pleased to hear of her again, as\nshe would have been to hear of anyone connected with Mr. Morland and\nLady Portinscale; and the subject offered material for frequent\nconversation among the whole party, as Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford had\nan interest in it also, through their acquaintanceship with the young\nclergyman in Bath.\n\nGeorgiana could not help glancing at Kitty occasionally when his name\nwas mentioned, and noticed that the slight embarrassment Kitty displayed\nat first soon wore off. There had evidently been a good many visitors at\nDesborough during the past month; Bingley had had another shooting\nparty, and there had been evenings of music, and even a small dance at\nthe house of a neighbour. Kitty spoke of these things as if the\nretrospect were one of great enjoyment, and Morland was so often\nreferred to, as to lead to the supposition that their constant meetings\nwere fraught with no discomfort on either side.\n\n\"But you have not told all our gaieties, Kitty,\" said Bingley, as they\nstood round the drawing-room fire one morning after breakfast. \"Did you\nknow, Elizabeth, that we went to see the amateur theatricals at\nAshbourne? The officers got them up among themselves and invited\neverybody; it was quite a spectacle, and they gave us supper afterwards\nin that fine great mess-room. I never saw anything better done.\"\n\n\"Yes, we had an invitation; I was sorry not to go to it, but it is too\nfar,\" said Elizabeth. \"I heard the performance was very good.\"\n\n\"Of course, you would have been asked; you ought to have gone, for it\nwas well worth seeing; our little charades were quite put in the shade.\nKitty can give you all information about it, for she had a splendid\nyoung officer sitting by her to tell her who everybody was.\"\n\n\"It was only Mr. Cathcart; he knew Colonel Forster once, and wanted to\nhear about Lydia,\" said Kitty, colouring and becoming deeply interested\nin the pattern of her lace handkerchief.\n\n\"And the one who escorted you to supper was not Mr. Cathcart; he was\nsomebody even more gorgeous and equally delightful--a field-marshal, at\nleast, I should think,\" continued her brother-in-law in bantering tones;\n\"altogether, Kitty did very well that evening. I expected Jane would\nhave had half the regiment coming up to her before it was over, to ask\nleave to call.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Bingley,\" said Kitty, in some confusion, getting up and going\nto help Mary Crawford, who was sorting her music; \"you are making too\nmuch of it; there was no reason why Mr. Macdonald should not call, if he\nwished to.\"\n\nBingley laughed, and proceeded to give so lively a description of the\ntheatricals, that Kitty could not help coming back and joining in, with\nsparkling eyes and every sign of pleasure in the reminiscence. Georgiana\nwatched her in some surprise, for nothing could be more unlike the\nbroken-hearted Kitty who had gone away six weeks before. Bingley forbore\nto tease her any longer; but finding himself alone with Elizabeth and\nGeorgiana later in the morning, he began at once: \"I think neither of\nyou need be under any more apprehension about Kitty. She was certainly\nvery low-spirited when she came to us, and I was afraid that young\nsailor's departure had had a devastating effect; but she has brightened\nup wonderfully and managed to enjoy herself again, just as a girl\nought.\"\n\n\"I am very glad,\" said Elizabeth. \"I knew she had taken it a good deal\nto heart at the time, but fresh interests will put fresh life into her.\"\n\n\"Exactly; there is no use in a pretty young woman like that moping about\na fellow who does not care for her; the best way to forget him is to\namuse herself with others, and I feel myself partly responsible for\nencouraging that young Price, so Jane and I have done our best to\ndistract her thoughts. Those officers are as pleasant a set of fellows\nas ever stepped, and Kitty by no means disliked them; but unfortunately\nthe regiment is just moving on, and the next one does not come till\nMarch. I have asked Bertram down again at the end of the month for some\nhunting; Kitty and he seemed to get on well, and we thought him a\ncapital fellow, did you not?\"\n\n\"Very agreeable indeed,\" said Elizabeth, in a tone of calmer praise,\nadding: \"and I have no doubt he is an excellent young man, though in\nspite of all, I should be inclined to adhere to Kitty's first preference\nto his cousin; Mr. Price's manners had more to recommend them, I\nthought.\"\n\nGeorgiana's heart bounded, and she turned away her face to hide her\nrising colour, as Bingley responded: \"Ah, yes, Elizabeth, you are right.\nIn spite of all, as you say, Price is the man we should have liked for\nher. There is a sterling character, I do believe. It would have done\nmost of us good to have to begin early, and make our own fortunes, as\nthat youth has done, and we should not be all so frank and modest at his\nage, I'll wager. Yes, I should be only too glad to get him back, but it\nis out of the question. I had a letter from him last week from\nCopenhagen; they expect to be cruising about in the North Sea for\nanother month or two; then he will probably have to go to some distant\nstation.\"\n\nGeorgiana had turned now to look at Bingley, her complexion changing\nfrom red to pale. She was grateful to Elizabeth for keeping the\nconversation going by some slight remark, for she could not have spoken.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued Bingley, \"we think it a great drawback to a sailor's\nlife, that he should have to be abroad so much, and away from his\nfriends; but cruises now are not as long as they used to be, and when a\nman has as much spirit as Price, he is glad to be on the move, to show\nauthorities the stuff he is made of. Price is commander on his present\nship, you know; the first since his promotion.\"\n\nThe entrance of Jane caused Bingley to break off, and Georgiana waited a\nlittle, in the hope that he had more to say on a subject of such an\nabsorbing nature; but, unfortunately, it was Mr. Bertram, not Mr. Price,\nto whom he reverted, calling upon Jane to confirm his expectations of\nthe former's visit, and Georgiana slipped out of the room as Jane began\nto tell Elizabeth how she had succeeded in obtaining Mr. Bennet's\npermission to keep Kitty until Easter. Georgiana needed to think over\nwhat she had heard, even though the pain to herself became more intense,\nin proportion as she gloried in the approval expressed of William Price\nby her friends. To hear him praised, to know him appreciated, was sweet\nto her; but how bitter by contrast was the knowledge that she had\nsacrificed his happiness and her own, in vain, that Kitty had so soon\nforgotten him as to be able to flirt with officers, and was ready to\naccept as a compensation for the loss of William Price, the attentions\nof any young men Bingley could collect around her! Georgiana could\nscarcely believe that the devotion of half a year could have died a\nnatural death in so short a time. She might almost have thought that\nKitty was feigning indifference, in order to conceal her chagrin, but\nfrom experience of Kitty's nature she knew that her friend was incapable\nof acting a sustained part, and that if she appeared to enjoy balls and\nflirtations, it was because they had for her as much zest as ever.\n\nGeorgiana might wonder, but she had no inclination to blame Kitty for\nany sign of inconsistency. It was undoubtedly much better for Kitty to\nget over her infatuation for William Price, if she could succeed in\ndoing so; but the consequences to Georgiana were far more grave, and she\nsuffered the more for realizing that Kitty had not, after all, so\ngreatly valued the thing she had sought after, the object which had\nbecome more and more precious to Georgiana than anything in the world.\nHer effort to defend Kitty to William, her refusal to accept his\ndevotion for herself--all had been wasted, fruitless, unnecessary! Not\nthat she would for one moment desire to withdraw the act of loyalty\ntowards her friend; but with heart-breaking regrets did she review the\nwhole sequence of events, which had so cruelly and inevitably separated\nWilliam Price and herself. Was it, she thought, a just punishment for\none who had made two such grievous mistakes previously that she should\nnow be accorded, too late, a glimpse of a happiness that would have\ntransformed her whole life? Bingley's casual mention of his movements\nhad reminded her forcibly how improbable it was that they should ever\nmeet again.\n\nShe had borne up bravely until then, but that night, when alone, she\ncould not help giving way to an access of grief severer than any she had\nknown before, and only a dread of arousing comment enabled her to assume\nan air of tolerable serenity when she appeared in the morning.\n\nIt happened that Jane, while admiring a new dress which Georgiana was\nwearing, was struck with the want of animation in the young girl's face,\nand her usual kindness prompted her to inquire solicitously how she did.\nGeorgiana would confess to no ailment but a slight cold, which she had\nhad for a week and been unable to throw off, and tried to make light of\nit when Jane appealed to Elizabeth to suggest what might be done to\nre-establish her health. Elizabeth felt a real concern as she looked\nclosely at her young sister, and reproached herself for having neglected\nto give her proper care.\n\n\"No, no, indeed, Elizabeth, it is not so,\" protested Georgiana. \"I am\nperfectly well. A cold always makes one feel stupid, and this mild damp\nweather is disagreeable, coming after those early frosts.\"\n\n\"Come and stay with us for two or three weeks,\" said Jane\naffectionately. \"The change will do you good, and Bingley and I shall be\nhappy to have you; your last visit was an unreasonably short one.\"\n\nGeorgiana gratefully but decidedly declined the offer, pleading various\nexcuses, but privately feeling that she would rather not be with Kitty\nagain just yet, amid scenes connected inseparably with William Price's\npresence.\n\n\"I think she ought to have a change, nevertheless,\" said Elizabeth, \"and\nit is too long to wait till we go to Bath in April. Would you not really\ncare to go to Desborough for a little, Georgiana, and see if it does you\ngood?\"\n\nGeorgiana faltered out something of reluctance, and Jane, smiling kindly\nat her, went away to leave the sisters to discuss it together. Elizabeth\ndrew the young girl to her, and tenderly asked if there was anything the\nmatter, in which her help or advice would be acceptable, and Georgiana,\nafter a few moments' silent struggle, recovered the self-command which\nthe proffer of sympathy had threatened to disturb, and replied that she\nwas sure she would be quite well directly, and would rather not go away\nfrom home until she went with the others.\n\n\"You are sure there is nowhere you would like to go, if not Desborough?\"\nasked Elizabeth, pondering. \"The Hursts would be delighted, I know, but\nyou have been there lately; what a pity Mrs. Annesley has gone abroad.\"\n\nGeorgiana only shook her head at these suggestions, and suddenly\nElizabeth exclaimed: \"I have thought of something--Mrs. Wentworth's\ninvitation! You remember that she asked you, in the letter I had from\nher with reference to her father and Miss Crawford. You thought at the\ntime that you might like to accept it some day.\"\n\nThe idea seemed to interest Georgiana more than the others. She raised\nher head from Elizabeth's shoulder, and said: \"I remember; it was a very\nkind message. The Wentworths live at Winchester, do they not?\"\n\n\"Yes, and Anne Wentworth is so good-hearted, so thoroughly sincere, that\nI know she would like to be taken at her word, and to have you propose\nyourself as a visitor. What do you think of it, Georgiana? I think you\nmight be very happy with such kind people, and the change of air and\nsurroundings would be complete. It seems a very long way off, I know,\nbut you could be taken to London in the carriage, with the two servants,\nas last year; and Captain Wentworth would doubtless be able to meet you\nthere, for he makes that journey constantly. Your brother and I would\ncome and fetch you any time, after Miss Crawford goes, as soon as you\nwish to come away.\"\n\nElizabeth rose and went to her writing-table, to find Mrs. Wentworth's\nletter, and to show Georgiana the message once more. The cordiality\nwhich it expressed could not be doubted, and Georgiana began to feel\nthat if she could ever find pleasure in anything again, it might be in\nthe quiet companionship of such friends as Captain and Mrs. Wentworth.\nShe had been greatly attracted by Mrs. Wentworth, and she had sufficient\ngood sense to know that it would be advantageous to her to have an\nentire change of environment, to be away for a time from Pemberley, and\nits associations. It would revive her courage, and help her to\nappreciate the many blessings that life still held for her. Georgiana\nwas not too young not to believe that her troubles were past mending,\nbut she was also too reasonable deliberately to nurse her unhappiness.\nShe accordingly allowed Elizabeth to write and propose the scheme, and\nhad grown so much accustomed to the idea as to be pleased when an answer\narrived in the form of a joint letter from the Wentworths, warmly\nwelcoming her to join their house, with every intimation of the delight\nit would afford them, and suggesting the last week in January as the\ndate for her journey to London, where her host would meet her, and\nconvey her straight to Winchester, a distance of sixty-five miles.\n\nThe arrangement was generally approved. Darcy and Elizabeth regretted\nlosing their sister, even for a time; but they hoped it would be\nbeneficial to her, and they could perceive that it fell in with her\ninclinations. There was no lack of escort, for Mrs. Grant and Miss\nCrawford, who were now talking of going in earnest, were anxious to\nalter their plans and travel to Bath round by London, for the pleasure\nof her company; but Darcy would not permit this, as he had resolved on\ntaking his sister himself, and Elizabeth induced them to remain with her\nuntil his return.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXIV\n\n\nJanuary was passing. The weather was remarkably mild and open for the\ntime of year, and the hunting men were rejoicing in their opportunities.\nThe ladies were able to take their daily walks and drives, in which Mrs.\nFerrars's sister, Mrs. Brandon, a very lovely and amiable woman, who had\ncome to watch over her sister's convalescence, was often invited to join\nthem. Mrs. Jennings had returned to London earlier in the month, sorely\ndisappointed, after such a promising beginning, at not having seen the\nsuccessful termination of even one love-affair during her stay. None of\nthe family at Pemberley had ever understood what part she played in the\ncatastrophe of November, except that she had shared in the general error\nmade by Kitty's friends, nor were they aware of the destiny she had\nmarked out for Georgiana; but Elinor, when she realized that something\nhad gone seriously wrong in consequence of the ball, had no difficulty\nin persuading the really good-natured old lady to confine her\nlamentations, conjectures, and comments to the ears of the Rectory\ninhabitants only. This end was the more easily attained since, after\nKitty's departure, there was no one to keep her supplied with\ninformation. When, however, that young lady returned in apparently good\nspirits, Mrs. Jennings was immeasurably delighted, and quite entered\ninto her willingness to talk of Cathcart and Macdonald, and, indeed,\nanyone and anything but William Price, and Mrs. Jennings had only to\nhear that Mr. Bertram was coming to stay at Desborough again, and not at\nPemberley, to be ready to console Kitty with a number of entirely new\nand revised prognostications as to the object of his visit.\n\nThe party at Pemberley were sitting together one evening after dinner.\nIt was about eight o'clock, and they had all settled to their customary\noccupations; Darcy and his wife were reading, Mrs. Grant working and\nGeorgiana was at the instrument, playing short snatches of music while\nMary Crawford sat close beside her, and asked for one and another of her\nfavourite pieces. Peace and tranquility reigned, and seemed as little\nlikely to be interrupted as on many previous evenings that had been\nsimilarly spent. The sudden sound of carriage wheels, therefore, and the\nrapid trot of horses, startled everyone, and alarmed one at least, for\nElizabeth's first apprehension was that Colonel Fitzwilliam had returned\nunexpectedly. Georgiana ceased playing, and all listened anxiously, but\nthe suspense lasted for the shortest possible time required by a visitor\nto get into the house, and on the door being flung open, Darcy had\nscarcely risen from his chair, before Tom Bertram followed his name into\nthe room with quick steps.\n\nTom Bertram had acted on many stages, but in none of the parts he had\never played had he made so sensational an entrance. The amazement of the\ninmates of the room on beholding him, the dismay of Mrs. Grant and her\nsister, his own disconcerted surprise at seeing who were Mrs. Darcy's\nguests, all tended to make the first minute one of extreme\nembarrassment, and it was only the knowledge of his urgency of his\nerrand that enabled him to recover himself sooner than any of the\nothers. Advancing to Mr. and Mrs. Darcy, he greeted them both, bowed to\nMrs. Grant, and to the corner of the room where Mary was shrinking out\nof sight behind Georgiana, and at once began speaking very quickly to\nthe master of the house.\n\n\"Mr. Darcy, I fear I have startled, I hope not frightened, you all by\nintruding at this late hour; but when you know how pressing is the need,\nyou will dispense with apologies. I grieve very much to say to say I am\nthe bearer of bad news, but believing that you ought to know, I\nconstituted myself the messenger. Your cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, has\nmet with an accident whilst out hunting to-day. I regret exceedingly to\ntell you, but his state is considered serious, and his friends thought\nit would be advisable for you to come.\"\n\n\"Fitzwilliam? Fitzwilliam hurt! Good God, what is this?\" exclaimed\nDarcy, completely roused out of his usual calm. \"How did it happen? Tell\nus all about it. I will go to him instantly\" (ringing the bell). \"In\nGod's name, Bertram, say he is still living? Where is he? How long will\nit take to get to him?\"\n\nElizabeth, though dreadfully shocked and distressed, had the wisdom to\nsend another servant for refreshments for Mr. Bertram, while Darcy\nordered his own things to be packed and his travelling carriage be\nbrought round, and in the slight bustle caused by these arrangements,\nMrs. Grant and Georgiana were able, almost unobserved, to attend to\nMary, who had not actually fainted, but had sunk down on a low couch,\nscarcely knowing what she did. Her sister and Georgiana supported her\nin between them, placed her in a more easy position, rubbed her hands\nand shielded her from the light; and Mary, with a very great effort,\ncollected herself sufficiently to listen to the details which Mr.\nBertram was hurriedly giving in answer to Mr. and Mrs. Darcy's\ninquiries. It appeared that Colonel Fitzwilliam had only just returned\nfrom London, and this was his first day out for some time. The fox had\ngot well away, and the hunt were in the midst of a fine run, when the\nColonel's horse came down with him at a blind fence. Bertram paused here\nto give more particulars than his impatient hearers desired, about the\nheight and width of the fence, and the exact manner in which the horse\nhad approached it, for it seemed that he himself had been riding near at\nthe time, and had witnessed the accident. The Colonel was pinned under\nthe animal, and was taken out unconscious, with a broken leg, and, it\nwas feared, some grave injury to the spine. Fortunately, the house of\nthe friend with whom he was staying was not far off, and he was borne\nthither, and the services of the apothecary were promptly obtained; but\nthe only opinion he could form was very grave, and pending the arrival\nof a more experienced surgeon, who had been sent for from Leicester, no\none could tell what an hour might bring forth.\n\nThe ladies were sick with horror: Mrs. Grant was weeping silently, and\nGeorgiana, as she held Mary's cold hand, felt that this was indeed the\nlast and crowning sorrow, for poor Cousin Robert to die without knowing\nthe happiness that ought to have been his.\n\n\"The pulse is so very weak; I think they fear a collapse of the whole\nsystem, even if he does recover consciousness,\" said Bertram, in too low\na tone to be heard by those at the other end of the room. \"They were\ntrying stimulants of various kinds when I came away.\"\n\nElizabeth's face was hidden. Darcy was too much overwhelmed to speak for\nsome moments, till with a sudden start of recollection he exclaimed:\n\"And you, Bertram? how came you to be there? and how come you are here\nnow?\"\n\nBertram, with a return to something of his nonchalant manner, explained\nthat he, too, had been staying in the same neighbourhood, with a friend,\nwho was, in fact, the master of that pack of hounds, and with whom he\noften spent a few days in the hunting season, as it was little over\ntwenty miles from his own house, Mansfield Park. \"I had been talking to\nColonel Fitzwilliam during the morning,\" he continued, \"and helped to\ncarry him back to Ashley's place, and when Ashley said his relations\nought to know, I decided at once to come with the news. I only delayed\nto change my clothes and have the chaise got ready, for I knew time was\nan object, and I could get over the ground quicker than anyone else they\ncould send.\"\n\n\"I am sure we are deeply indebted to you, Bertram,\" said Darcy, grasping\nhim warmly by the hand, while Elizabeth joined him in expressing the\nsincerest gratitude. \"You could not have done us a greater service, and\nit is one we shall never forget. It was an impulse of true goodness and\nunselfishness that prompted you to ride straight to us, disregarding\nyour own fatigue and inconvenience; few men would have done as much.\"\n\nBertram disclaimed, and as Georgiana came forward to add her thanks to\nthose of the others, he bowed to her with gallantry, assuring her that\nfatigue was nothing, if he could be of use to friends whom he so greatly\nesteemed, and he only wished that he could have brought news to relieve\nanxiety, instead of creating it.\n\nBy this time word was brought that the more substantial meal which had\nbeen ordered for Mr. Bertram was ready in the dining-room, and Darcy\nescorted him thither, to attend to his wants and to obtain the\nparticulars as to his journey from Leicestershire. The distance was\nforty-five miles, and Darcy proposed to start within half an hour, and\nreach his destination some time during the night, but he pressed his\nvisitor to stay at least until the next day, and if he would, to rest\nhimself and his horses.\n\nTheir peaceful evening had been turned into confusion and wretchedness.\nThe quiet circle in the drawing-room was broken up, and Mrs. Grant,\nfearing greatly for her sister, was thankful to lead her to her own\nroom, there to recover as best she might from the frightful shock of Tom\nBertram's news. Darcy soon went upstairs to prepare for his journey, and\nhis wife busied herself with helping him, and with placing in his\nluggage any article she could think of that might conduce to the sick\nman's comfort, while a maze of thoughts occupied her mind, chilling\nfear, apprehension, and dread of what might be happening to the loved\nfriend at such a distance, and anxiety on account of Miss Crawford,\nwhose trembling and distressed condition had not escaped her.\n\nA few minutes later Georgiana came to her door, showing traces of tears,\nbut quite calm, and begging to be made useful. Elizabeth was just then\ngiving some directions to the maid, so Georgiana waited until they were\ndone, and then, coming close to her sister, she said: \"Elizabeth, do you\nthink we could do anything for Miss Crawford? I went to wish her\ngood-night, and she tried to smile and say something sympathizing, but\ncould hardly utter the words. I am sure she is terribly concerned about\nall this. She almost looks like a different person, so pale and\nstricken. Do you think she can possibly be caring for Cousin Robert all\nthe time, and not know it till now? Oh, dear Elizabeth, is it not\ndreadful to think it may be too late?\"\n\nElizabeth gazed at her sister, listening intently, and pondering all\nGeorgiana said. True, indeed, that it would be a dreadful thing to\ncontemplate, if Mary really loved Fitzwilliam, and the knowledge came\ntoo late to do good to either. And even if Mary knew her own heart at\nlast, was it not too late, when pride sealed her lips, and Fitzwilliam\nwas lying near to death, forty miles away, perhaps never more able to\nsee her or hear her? Elizabeth experienced a momentary feeling of\ndespair; the powers ranged against her seemed almost too strong to be\nattacked; but rallying her forces, and putting in the front of her mind\nthe one hopeful thought that Fitzwilliam might live till Darcy reached\nhim, or longer, she said to Georgiana: \"I think I shall try; I will ask\nher to send him a message, if it is as we think; it will be better than\nnothing, even if he is only just able to understand it.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes,\" exclaimed Georgiana, clasping her hands in intense\neagerness, \"do ask her, dear Elizabeth; she will surely tell you, and my\nbrother will tell him. Whatever happens, she will be glad to think she\nhas done it. Do ask her; do not lose a minute; there is so little time.\"\n\nVoices were heard in the corridor; Darcy was speaking to the servants,\nwho were carrying out his luggage. Elizabeth hesitated no longer,\npausing only to say: \"Dear Georgiana, would you mind going to sit with\nMr. Bertram? I am afraid it may be tiresome for you to entertain a\nstranger just now, but he is alone, and it would be only a kind\nattention, after what he has done for us,\" and to receive Georgiana's\nassent, before going swiftly to Miss Crawford's room.\n\nShe found that Georgiana's description had been all too accurate. Miss\nCrawford had not wept, but her expression of hopeless misery sent a pang\nthrough Elizabeth's heart. She had sent her sister away, and had been\nsitting on her bed, too stunned for action, almost for thought, and she\nmade no resistance when Elizabeth placed her on the couch, sat beside\nher, and taking both her hands, began to plead with her, quickly and\nsimply, without premeditation.\n\n\"Dear Miss Crawford, I have come to ask you to do something for my poor\ncousin, something which only you can do. You heard what Mr. Bertram\nsaid, of his dangerous state, and it distressed you as much as us, I\nknow. I would not for a moment seek to pry into your inmost feelings,\nbut we are come to matters of life and death, and it is on _his_ account\nthat I do venture to ask you, if you feel that you could listen to him\nif he were here, then will you send him a word, a message, something to\nshow that you are thinking of him?\"\n\nMary replied after a minute or two, in a stifled voice: \"I would send\nhim such a message, but do you think he would care to have it?\"\n\n\"I do, indeed, most truly. I understand your hesitation; you think you\ncannot speak of love to him, when he has not spoken to you; but I would\nstake my life on his devotion and faithfulness. The words you send him\nwill bring comfort and peace of mind, whatever the issue.\"\n\nMary shuddered, and withdrew her trembling hands. \"Mr. Bertram seems to\nthink he will die.\"\n\n\"We cannot tell; he is a strong man and had not had the best advice when\nMr. Bertram was there. We can only hope, and my husband is starting\nalmost immediately, and will carry any message you feel able to send,\ntrusting that he will be in time to deliver it.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes,\" exclaimed Mary, rising and walking restlessly about the\nroom; \"he is so good and generous that if he still cares, he would\noverlook all, he would pardon the errors and foolishness that have led\nto this misunderstanding--but the past, Mrs. Darcy, does he know and\nforgive that? I wish I could tell. Seeing Mr. Bertram brings it all back\nagain--my brother, his sister--the divorce--what Lady Catherine heard,\nthe world believes, you know--and just when one repents it all most, it\ncomes back just like a spectre to haunt one.\"\n\nElizabeth replied very earnestly: \"At such a time as this, it would be\ncruel to mislead you, and I only say what I sincerely believe, that\nColonel Fitzwilliam knows everything to which you refer, and it makes\nnot the smallest difference to him. It would not, you should be aware,\nto any man whose love was worthy of the name. That should not weigh with\nyou for a moment. The only thing that signifies in the least is whether\nyou can return that love: the only barrier between you is being unable\nto return it. I would not urge you against your will, or take advantage\nof a moment of strong emotion; you alone know whether it would make you\nhappier to send a word of hope to him.\"\n\n\"Happier? Ah, I do not know,\" said Mary sorrowfully. \"I do not seem able\nto think of happiness. And yet, I should be glad for him to know, since\nyou think he still cares to know, and it is all I can now do for him.\nYou need not be afraid of my not trusting my feelings, Mrs. Darcy. This\nhas shown me all too late what they really are, though my folly and\nobstinacy have blinded me all these months.\"\n\n\"We will not say too late, dear Miss Crawford,\" said Elizabeth, going up\nto where Miss Crawford was standing by the mantelshelf, leaning her head\non her arm. \"We do not know that it is too late, and I believe that it\nwill be an immense comfort to you to take this one step. Explanations\ncan come after. I am not afraid of Colonel Fitzwilliam being unable to\nclear away all doubts and fears when he is able to speak for himself\nagain.\"\n\nThere was a moment's pause, and Elizabeth continued: \"I must not stay\nnow. Mr. Darcy is so impatient to be off, but I will be back to you.\nWill you tell me what I may say? so little will suffice; or would you\nrather write it?\"\n\nMary shook her head, still keeping her face hidden, and said in a barely\naudible voice: \"Ask Mr. Darcy, if he will be so kind--explain things to\nhim how you like--but say I send Colonel Fitzwilliam my--my love; that I\nbeg his forgiveness; and that I hope--he will soon--be able to come\nhome--to me.\"\n\nElizabeth just caught the last words, waited to assure herself there was\nno more, and pressing Mary's hand, went quietly out of the room. Though\nmuch moved by their interview, the exigencies of the moment demanded\nthat she should quickly recover her composure, and brace herself for the\nparting with her husband. There would be time--all too much time--for\nthought when the moment of action was over; there would be hours of\nsuspense to be borne and another sufferer to console. As she came out\nupon the gallery, she heard persons talking and moving in the hall\nbelow, and distinguished her husband's voice saying: \"I ought to be with\nhim soon after one o'clock,\" words which revived her courage, and she\ndescended to find Darcy, Georgiana and Mr. Bertram standing by the\nhearth, Darcy completely equipped for his journey, and the servants\nwaiting by the front door.\n\nGeorgiana, who had been enduring keen anxiety during Elizabeth's\nabsence, and had been exerting herself to keep the gentlemen occupied in\neating and talking, so that Elizabeth might not be interrupted too soon\nby Darcy's haste to depart, gave her a nervous glance, which was\ntempered by relief when she saw her sister draw Darcy into the library\nfor a few parting words. She could scarcely attend to Mr. Bertram's\namiable chatter, or reply to his inquiries for Mr. and Mrs. Bingley, and\nthe other friends he had met on his previous visit, for picturing in her\nmind what was going on in the library and trying to decide whether\nElizabeth had been successful in her mission.\n\nAt last the door opened; they reappeared; Darcy was grave, but Georgiana\nthought his brow had somewhat lightened since he went in, and Elizabeth\ngave her a bright and reassuring look. There was no time for more, and\nthe carriage was already waiting; the farewells were quickly spoken, and\nin another moment Darcy had passed out and was gone.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXV\n\n\nTo Elizabeth and Georgiana, the events of the evening seemed like a\ndreadful dream. Less than an hour ago they had been sitting at their\noccupations, as tranquil and secure as if disaster did not exist; and\nnow the bolt had fallen, scattering them and bringing to each its\nmessage of terror and dismay. Georgiana felt as if it would be the\nhardest matter in the world to settle to any pretence of the ordinary\nlife again, until news reached them from her brother; she longed to be\nable to be alone, to think it all over quietly, or to go to Elizabeth,\nto hear the result of her appeal to Miss Crawford, and instead she was\nobliged to establish herself in the drawing-room with Mr. Bertram, who\nshowed no sign of wishing to go to bed, but was evidently prepared to\nsit up talking and drinking tea until midnight.\n\nGeorgiana took out her embroidery frame, and prepared to be as agreeable\na listener as she could, for she expected Elizabeth, who had gone to\nMiss Crawford, would come back at any minute, and she really felt more\nthan a common measure of gratitude to Mr. Bertram for the service he\nhad rendered them. This gratitude she again endeavoured to express, when\nMr. Bertram began discussing the heavy state of the roads, and the\nconsequent delays to which Darcy might be subjected.\n\n\"Pray do not name it, Miss Darcy; as I said, I am only too glad to have\nbeen of the slightest assistance. It was a mere chance that I was there,\nfor I should have returned home this week, but the open weather tempted\nme to stay on for a day or two longer.\"\n\n\"It was indeed fortunate for us, for we should have had no information\nuntil to-morrow, if we had had to wait for a letter.\"\n\nTom Bertram repeated that he \"was very glad,\" looking into the fire in\nan absent-minded way that Georgiana scarcely noticed, so absorbed was\nshe in her thoughts. She paid but little more attention when he suddenly\nrose, stationed himself with his back to the fire, and a little nearer\nher, and began to speak, apparently on the same topic, for in the first\nfew minutes she could only gather an impression of his sharing in the\nevents following the accident; his telling Mr. Ashley that he was a\nfriend of Colonel Fitzwilliam's, and knew all his relatives, and would\nbe the fittest person to bear the news to them; of Mr. Ashley's heartily\nagreeing, and of his haste to get home and order his carriage and start.\nThe narrative went on, Georgiana hearing very little after\nLeicestershire was left behind, for her thoughts had lingered with the\npoor sufferer there, when, with a start, she became aware that all this\nwas directed at _her_, that Mr. Bertram was trying to explain that he\nhad welcomed the opportunity of hurrying to Pemberley, because it would\ndoing her and her family a service, than which he could have no greater\nsatisfaction, and because it would afford him the privilege of being in\nher presence once more. Georgiana, amazed and horrified, endeavoured to\nstop him; but Tom was not to be prevented from making a speech which he\nhad been rehearsing for at least four hours on his journey. Some words\nwhich fell from her lips, an appeal to have some respect for this sad\noccasion, which she had snatched at as the argument most likely to move\nhim, were of no avail. That he could address her at such a time he\nimmediately pointed out to be a proof of his ardour, which merited\npardon by reason of its unquenchable nature, for he had intended, he\nexplained, to wait until he came to Desborough at the end of the month,\nand then to have sought an interview, but his impatience to throw\nhimself at her feet and declare his passion would brook no delay.\n\nNothing could have been more distasteful to Georgiana than such\nsentiments. To hear the words \"admiration\" and \"devotion\" uttered by Mr.\nBertram was not only an outrage upon the present hour, occupied as it\nwas with the gravest solicitude for the life of a friend, but also upon\nthe past, when similar words had been spoken to her by William Price.\nFrom no one else could she bear to hear them; coming from his cousin,\nshe could almost have called them an insult. Of course, he could not\nknow that, but it almost seemed like trading upon having placed them\nunder an obligation to him, that he should presume to speak in a manner\nso repugnant to her. Too vexed to choose her words, when Mr. Bertram\nstopped for breath, having brought his peroration to a close by an offer\nin correct form of his hand and heart, she replied coldly that she was\nmuch honoured by his proposals, but it was entirely out of her power to\naccept them. Bertram had not expected a favourable reply on the instant,\nbut he had hardly expected so decisive an unfavorable one. He stepped\nforward with outstretched hands, and an eager, \"But, Miss Darcy--\" to\nwhich her only response was to move haughtily away, and at that moment,\nto the relief of the lady and the chagrin of the gentleman, Elizabeth\nentered the room. Only the good manners habitual to both could have\nhelped them to carry off the situation. Tom Bertram, checked in one of\nhis flights of eloquence, descended to earth again with an observation\non the weather, and for the next few minutes the temperature and the\nprospects of rain were debated with great earnestness.\n\nElizabeth could hardly have failed to guess what kind of interview she\nhad interrupted, and out of compassion to Georgiana she soon recommended\nher to go to bed. The young girl needed no second bidding; Bertram\nopened the door to her with great ceremony, which was acknowledged by\nthe slightest of bows, and she gladly sought the shelter of her room,\nastonished to find that it was not more than half-past nine o'clock.\nCould it be possible that it was barely two hours since Mr. Bertram's\narrival? Would this interminable evening, with its shocks, surprises and\ndisturbances, and yet more surprises, ever draw to a close? Georgiana\nwas so unnerved that she sat down and shed a few tears, but a few only,\nfor with such a real grief ever present, she could not spare much\nconsideration for Mr. Bertram's unwelcome attack. It had been\nbewildering and annoying, but she was not going to worry about it. He\nhad acted on some silly impulse, and could not possibly be serious. He\nscarcely knew her--a week's acquaintance, and he talked of heartfelt\ndevotion, and expected her to be ready to listen to such nonsense! She\ncould not conceive what had actuated him, and resented greatly that\nmerely because he was heir to a title and fortune, and had ridden\nforty-five miles in a great hurry, he should suppose himself to be an\nacceptable suitor. Some expressions he had used, showing that he was\nconfident of having the approval of her family, roused her special\nindignation. If only she had not so unluckily been alone with him--if\nMrs. Grant had not gone upstairs!\n\nMrs. Grant! Georgiana started violently, for until that moment she had\ncompletely forgotten the association of Mr. Bertram with their two\nguests. She had supposed Mary's agitation to be caused merely by the\nnews of Colonel Fitzwilliam, and now perceived that the sight of the\nmessenger must have been painful enough apart from all else. What\nmiserable complications had resulted from the fact that it should have\nbeen Tom Bertram, of all their acquaintance, who had happened to be\nhunting with the Belvoir hounds that day! But she could not wish his\ndeed of kindness undone, nor she believed could Miss Crawford, or anyone\nelse, whatever the present inconvenience to themselves, for everything\nwas unimportant compared with what his coming had effected; and now, it\nwould not matter if only he would go away again immediately. Georgiana\nsat meditating schemes by which she, Mary and Mrs. Grant might all avoid\nseeing him again, when a knock at her door was followed by the entrance\nof Elizabeth.\n\n\"Yes, Georgiana,\" Elizabeth said, smiling in response to the girl's shy\nglance, \"Mr. Bertram has made me his confidante. I am sorry if you were\nupset, my dear; he seems to be afraid it was something of a surprise to\nyou, but he hopes you will take time, and do him the honour of thinking\nit over.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no, Elizabeth,\" Georgiana burst out, her cheeks crimsoning, \"I\ndo not want time--I shall not think it over. I do not care for Mr.\nBertram in the least, and I never shall. Please tell him to go away and\nforget all about it.\"\n\n\"Why, my dear, this is very determined. He began in the wrong way, I\nthink, and certainly at the wrong time, but he is very anxious to be\nallowed to come back, and set about his wooing more gradually. I told\nhim I thought you were quite unaware of his feelings.\"\n\n\"So I was, but I do not want to hear about them,\" said Georgiana, more\nquietly, for she was beginning to be a little ashamed of her anger. \"I\nam very much obliged to Mr. Bertram--I know it is very kind of him, and\neverything, but I cannot possibly marry him.\"\n\n\"Are you sure it is entirely out of the question?\" asked Elizabeth. \"You\nwere a little startled, perhaps. It is true, we have not seen much of\nhim, but he is very agreeable, and his position is unexceptionable.\nAbove all, he bears a high character as far as we know, and has a good\nheart, as his action of to-day proves. His cousin, Mr. Price, spoke very\nwarmly of him. Unless you are quite certain, I think your brother would\nlike you to give the matter due consideration, as at any other time than\nthis you might feel more in a mood for such subjects.\"\n\n\"Pray, pray, Elizabeth,\" exclaimed Georgiana, nervously, \"do not ask me.\nEven if we were not in trouble to-day, as we are, it would make no\ndifference. I am sure Mr. Bertram is excellent and amiable, but I do\nnot--I cannot--I hope Fitzwilliam will not be angry, but I dislike the\nidea so very much.\"\n\n\"If that is so, my dear Georgiana, you shall not be tormented about it\nany more. I do not know if I am glad or sorry, it has all happened so\nquickly, but it is right that you should judge for yourself. Mr. Bertram\nwill be greatly disappointed, still, that cannot be helped. I suppose I\nam to be deputed to get rid of the poor man.\"\n\n\"If you would be so very kind, Elizabeth.\"\n\n\"Well, I must break it to him early to-morrow morning, since I really\nthink we have had agitations enough for one evening. In any case, I\nshould have had to ask him to cut his visit short, for from what I have\nheard, I do not think that Miss Crawford would care to see him again.\"\n\n\"No, no, indeed, that must be prevented if possible. And now, do tell\nme, for I have been longing for an opportunity to ask you, what was the\nresult of your conversation, if I may be allowed to hear it?\"\n\nElizabeth related briefly what had passed between them, and told how her\nhusband could scarcely believe at first that Miss Crawford had yielded,\nand had voluntarily sent the message that he was asked to deliver, but\non being convinced of her sincerity, he willingly promised that if his\ncousin's state permitted it, he would convey to him the words of hope\nand comfort, and would endeavour to make anything clear that Fitzwilliam\nmight not be able to understand.\n\n\"Of course, we had so few minutes together,\" said Elizabeth, \"and your\nbrother had not thought of it all for so long. He quite believed that\nall was over between them; he did not even know that she had owned to\ncaring for him once. It was difficult for him to realize that she always\nhad cared, though he did not need me to tell him what happiness it would\nbe to poor Robert to know it, if he reached him in time.\"\n\n\"I am so glad, so very glad,\" cried Georgiana, the tears of joy standing\nin her eyes. \"It is as it should be. My brother will see it all\nplainly, when he thinks it over. Poor Miss Crawford! How she must have\nsuffered! She did not realize it herself, I suppose, and that was why\nshe would not meet him again. I do not quite understand how it all\nhappened, but it does not signify now. If he lives, nothing need keep\nthem apart, and at all events, he will have her message. Nothing will\nmake me believe that it is too late for that.\"\n\nThis naturally led them back to a discussion of the accident, the\ncondition of the victim, and all the chances and possibilities of the\ncase, which could not be gone over often enough. Elizabeth at last\nprepared to leave the room, as the hour was late, but struck by a\npassing recollection, she looked back from the door to say, with a\nsmile: \"I must tell you, Georgiana, that _your_ attitude has surprised\nme more than Mr. Bertram's. Lately, when you have been looking so pale\nand unlike yourself, it has occurred to me that there must be some\nperson of whom you were thinking a great deal, with a disturbing effect;\nand I confess that when I interrupted you and Mr. Bertram this evening,\nit crossed my mind that he might be that person.\"\n\n\"Elizabeth! how could you think such a thing?\" exclaimed Georgiana,\nturning away, blushing and confused, and thankful that Elizabeth had not\ndirectly asked her whether any such person was in existence.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXVI\n\n\nThe disconsolate Mr. Bertram duly took his leave the following morning,\nhaving seen no one besides Mrs. Darcy and Mrs. Grant, but a brief\ninterview with the former had convinced him of the futility of any\nsecond application to her sister-in-law. He was quite unable to account\nfor his rebuff, and his vexation, combined with the awkwardness that he\nfelt in Mrs. Grant's presence, made their party round the\nbreakfast-table an exceedingly uncomfortable one. Tom Bertram was\npossessed of a great deal more conscience than Mr. Yates, and could\nnever have used Miss Crawford's name as freely as that gentleman had\ndone; moreover, he was quite conscious that his own family deserved a\nshare of the blame for the _esclandre_, which was usually borne by the\ntwo chief culprits; consequently a meeting with any of the Crawfords was\nquite as unwelcome to him as to them, and he was greatly relieved when,\nafter an exchange of formal civilities, he could betake himself to his\ncarriage and give directions to be conveyed to Desborough Park. To be\nsure, he was antedating his visit there by ten or twelve days; but he\nknew that he would be welcomed by the hospitable Bingleys, and they\nwould all be eager to hear the shocking news.\n\nThe ladies at Pemberley passed the next few hours in the deepest anxiety\nand suspense. They tried to talk of other things, but they could think\nof little but the one subject. Georgiana would have forgotten Mr.\nBertram as soon as he was out of the house, for she could not believe\nhis regard for her to be very genuine, or his wound very deep, but that\nshe so dreaded the disapprobation of her brother, when he should come to\nhear of what had happened. Even Elizabeth would not have been surprised\nif she had wished to accept him! It was mortifying in a way, though a\nrelief in another, that no one ever supposed it was possible that Mr.\nPrice could have cared for _her_!\n\nDarcy had promised to send off an express letter as early as he could,\nand a servant had gone to the neighbouring town to meet it, and so avoid\ndelay. Dinner was just over, a meal which they could only make a\npretence of eating, when the butler entered, and they saw that he had\nbrought the longed-for dispatch. It was taken to Mrs. Darcy, and she\nlost not a moment in communicating its contents. The news was not what\nthey had dreaded; indeed, the account was as good as could be expected;\nDarcy found his cousin's condition to be grave, but not hopeless, for\nColonel Fitzwilliam had recovered consciousness before his arrival. He\nwas not permitted to talk, but was able to understand what was said to\nhim. The surgeon had enjoined perfect quiet, and though at present he\ncould scarcely diagnose all the injuries, he believed that the head had\nescaped. The danger was not over, but the patient's good constitution\nwould help him materially, and the fact that he was enduring severe\npain was not considered to be an altogether unfavorable symptom.\n\nThe report was, in general, an intense relief, though anxiety still\nprevailed, and deep compassion and concern must still possess those who\nlistened. Still it was much to be thankful for; on reflection, it seemed\nto be the best they could have hoped. Georgiana remained with Mrs.\nGrant, talking it over, while Elizabeth drew Miss Crawford into her\nboudoir, and said: \"I know you will like to hear the rest of my\nhusband's letter. It is meant for you only. He writes: 'As soon as I was\nallowed to speak to Fitzwilliam, and had ascertained that he was\ncomfortable as he could be made, I told him what you desired me to say\nrespecting Miss Crawford's presence in our house, and the confidence she\nmade to you. It seemed to be a great surprise to him, and I feared would\nexcite him too much; but when I repeated her message, in the exact words\nwhich you gave me, I could perceive an immediate effect on him for good.\nHe seemed slow to believe it, and murmured a few syllables about its\nbeing too great a happiness; but, after about half an hour, he signed\nthat he wished to speak to me again, and whispered: \"Send her my love:\ntell her that she has given me something to live for.\" He was not able\nto say more and soon after fell asleep; you must recollect that there is\na great deal of fever, and consequent weakness. Still, he is decidedly\nnot worse, and I am more than half inclined to think that the stimulus\nhis mind has received may help towards his recovery. You know I am not\ngiven to conjecture, but he is surprisingly ready to do everything he is\ntold, and anxious to think himself better. If I am right, the\nresponsibility will be Miss Crawford's, and it is one which I think she\nwill not be unwilling to bear. Pray give her my warmest regards, and\ntell her I hope the time is not far distant when we shall be happily\nreunited at Pemberley.'\"\n\nSuch a letter could not all at once be realized, or recovered from. Mary\nCrawford tried to utter some words of thanks, but tears impeded her\nspeech. Only when the joy burst upon her was she fully conscious of all\nthe misery of the last few months; the light served to make the darkness\nmore visible. Looking back upon the mists of pride, of resentfulness,\nand misunderstanding, from which she had emerged, it seemed almost\nincredible for a time that she had reached the clearer air, the sunshine\nof love and mutual comprehension. She longed to turn to her kind friend,\nto talk freely with her, over all that had seemed puzzling, and when,\nafter a very few anxious days, better accounts from Leicestershire began\nto come in, and the gloom lifted, they could venture to let their minds\ndwell on hopeful possibilities once more. It was satisfactory that the\nwhole situation was already known to the other members of their little\nparty, and that Georgiana, as well as Mrs. Grant, could freely offer the\naffection and sympathy of a sister.\n\n\"Mrs. Darcy,\" said Mary one day, \"I am possessed with a curiosity to\nknow which you think worst of me for--my keeping Colonel Fitzwilliam at\narm's length while in London, or my confession of weakness the other\nday, after the bold assertions I made when you spoke to me during our\nwalk?\"\n\n\"Indeed, I do not think ill of you for any of those things,\" returned\nElizabeth; \"they seem to me to have been most natural; but what do I\nthink was a little bit foolish, was your allowing Sir Walter Elliot to\nbe so attentive that the world concluded you were engaged. Your friends\nought to have warned you that it might deter persons you really esteemed\nfrom approaching you.\"\n\n\"I was afraid you were going to say something about that!\" exclaimed\nMiss Crawford, holding her hands to her ears in mock dismay. \"I quite\nexpect that Colonel Fitzwilliam and I shall spend some hours in violent\nmutual recrimination when he arrives, and that will be one of our\nsubjects. But, seriously, Mrs. Darcy, although I know now it was\nunpardonably foolish, I was not conscious then of the comments that were\nbeing made. Our friendship with the Elliots had quite another aspect for\nme, other possibilities connected with my brother--but that will not\ninterest you. I tolerated Sir Walter Elliot, but I never liked him, and\nI never thought of him as having any serious intentions, until a\ngood-natured friend, Mrs. Palmer, called to congratulate me on my\nsupposed engagement. By the way, she told me that her mother, Mrs.\nJennings, had meant to come by with her, but had been prevented; I did\nnot know the worthy Mrs. Jennings then, but since I have met her I have\nfelt thankful she was not present on that occasion; it would have been\nrather overwhelming.\"\n\n\"She must have been sorry to miss such an opportunity,\" said Elizabeth,\nwith a smile.\n\n\"Yes, poor Mrs. Jennings! But congratulations on a thing that has _not_\nhappened are rather difficult to receive at any time, are they not? From\nthat moment, I do assure you, I got a horrid fright, and determined to\nchange my attitude towards Sir Walter Elliot completely. I must have\nbeen partly successful, for it precipitated things to such an extent--at\nall events, the result was not agreeable. It really was a wretched time!\nand Colonel Fitzwilliam disappeared and no one knew where or why.\"\n\nElizabeth had long realized that her cousin had not been the only\nsufferer in the past year, and she knew that Miss Crawford's lively\nmanner of talking was often assumed to hide deeper emotions. She truly\nrejoiced that whatever fears and anxieties might have to be endured\nbefore the lovers met again, nothing could shake the foundations of\ntheir happiness.\n\nAfter about ten days, Darcy's letters made it clear that the danger was\npast, and steady, if slow, progress might be looked for. He was, of\ncourse, quite unable to visit, and Georgiana, who had written to Mrs.\nWentworth to postpone her visit, consulted Elizabeth as to whether it\nwould be better to abandon it altogether, but Elizabeth thought that it\nwould be unnecessary to do so, and also a pity, for Georgiana's sake,\nand Darcy, on being applied to give his consent to her journeying to\nLondon with the escort of two servants, as had been originally proposed.\n\nThe plan, therefore, was to stand. A date was arranged with Captain\nWentworth, and on a cold windy evening of the second week in February,\nMr. Darcy's carriage with Mr. Darcy's sister, drove up to the hotel in\nSt. James's Street where her host was to meet her. The said carriage was\nto return through Leicestershire, for it was hoped, that, in the course\nof the next few days, Colonel Fitzwilliam might be well enough to be\nbrought back in it to Pemberley.\n\nThe inclement weather, solitude, and fatigue had sent Georgiana's\nspirits down to a low ebb as she looked out at the wet streets, and\nrecalled her last visit to London, under such very different\ncircumstances. It was impossible for her not to be thinking of William\nPrice, and the occasion when they had been together there, and wondering\nif he was in town at that minute. She would have liked to know that he\nwas, even though it was so utterly improbable that they should meet,\nsince neither of them could know what the other's movements were. Such\nthoughts were bad companions for Georgiana, but the arrival of Captain\nWentworth, kind and cheerful as ever, and with the heartiest of\nwelcomes, did much to disperse the gloom, and he proved such an\nenlivening companion on the following day that when they reached\nWinchester in time for a late dinner, she did not feel as bad as if she\nhad been travelling for so many hours.\n\nTo see Mrs. Wentworth again was a keen pleasure. The letters they had\nexchanged formed the groundwork of a more intimate friendship, for\ndespite Anne's seniority in years, their natures were thoroughly\ncongenial, and within a few hours Georgiana felt completely at home in\nthe charming little house not far from the Cathedral, which Captain\nWentworth had purchased soon after his marriage.\n\nShe and her hostess were sitting together, the first day of her visit,\nexchanging inquiries after their mutual friends, and Georgiana was half\nhoping to hear some mention of William Price's name, as from what she\nhad seen at Mrs. Hurst's dinner-party, she judged that the Wentworths\nknew him tolerably well. Yes--Mrs. Wentworth referred to that\nevening--said that she had seen Mrs. Hurst when last she was in\ntown--Miss Darcy had heard more lately, probably--did she remember the\nyoung officer, Captain Price now, who had been present on that occasion?\n\nGeorgiana could reply in quite her ordinary manner that she had\nfrequently seen Mr. Price since, and told of his visits to Desborough\nand Pemberley.\n\nMrs. Wentworth listened with interest. \"I am very glad you have seen\nsomething in him, for I am sure you must all have liked him, do you\nnot?\" she said. \"But, now, what an odd creature he is, never to have\nmentioned it. To be sure, I have not seen him since, or he would\nprobably have done so, but hearing from a friend that he was in England\nagain, and knowing you had met, I wrote to ask him to come and spend a\nfew days here during your visit. It was a great liberty, I know, dear\nMiss Darcy, but he is a first favourite with Captain Wentworth and me,\nand we thought it would have been pleasant for him to have come just\nnow; young people always amuse each other. He has so little time on\nshore, and up to last week I believed he was still abroad.\"\n\nGeorgiana's heart beat as if it would suffocate her, but she managed to\nreturn her friend's look, and say in a steady voice: \"Yes, it would have\nbeen very nice. Is Captain Price not able to come?\"\n\n\"No, most unfortunately not. I am very sorry, more so than ever now I\nknow he has been to your part of the world. But he writes to say he\nfears he ought not to come--all sorts of regrets, and to tell Miss Darcy\nhe is very sorry not to see her again. It is not at all clear why he\ncannot come, for he only repeats that he is sailing again some time next\nmonth, and thinks he had better stay in London, or go down to see his\nsister, until he goes.\"\n\nGeorgiana sat perfectly silent, gazing into the fire. Even from Mrs.\nWentworth's first words she had not expected that William Price was\ncoming, but to feel that the opportunity had been within his reach, and\nhe could not--her heart told her that it was _would_ not--avail himself\nof it, was very hard to bear. He was right not to come, if he believed\nthat the reason for his rejection still existed; Georgiana honoured him\nfor that; but was there anything else? Had he changed his mind? Was he\nceasing to care? Georgiana hardly knew, until that bitter moment, how\nmuch she had been pinning her hopes upon seeing him again some day; and\nshe thought, with something like bitterness, that it had not been much\nuse to picture him in London, and consequently somewhat nearer to her,\nwhen, as things stood, he was immeasurably far away, whether in London\nor in Derbyshire or on the North Sea.\n\nHer want of response passed unnoticed as Captain Wentworth entered the\nroom, proposing to take the ladies out. His wife observed that she had\nbeen telling Miss Darcy of Captain Price's refusal of their invitation,\nand of their puzzle to account for it.\n\n\"Yes, it is a very ungallant thing, is it not, Miss Darcy? particularly\nwhen he has been told what an attraction we had for him. I thought he\nwould have come, as he is so often up and down this road, between\nSouthampton and London, but I suppose he has got some other irons in the\nfire.\"\n\nGeorgiana was glad to be able to leave the room, passing off the subject\nwith a smile and a vague expression of regret, but the tumult of her\nmind was so painfully great that it was some days before she could find\nanything like the quiet enjoyment in her surroundings which she had\npromised herself. All those feelings which she had striven to repress\nwere rising up again with renewed force. She struggled with herself\nalone, for she could not bear to tell Mrs. Wentworth the whole story; it\nwas different for Miss Crawford with Elizabeth, but in this case the\nbest-intentioned friend could not disentangle the skein.\n\nNot long after her arrival she had the delight of hearing from Elizabeth\nthat the engagement of Fitzwilliam and Mary was an accomplished fact. He\nwas at home again, none the worse for the journey, and gaining strength\nrapidly under so many efficient nurses, \"which of course means _one!_\"\nwrote Elizabeth. Her pleasure was enhanced, a few days later, by\nreceiving a letter from her cousin himself, the first he had been\nallowed to write, in which he spoke with gratitude of the happiness he\nhad so nearly missed, and thanked Georgiana affectionately for her share\nin bringing it about. \"Indeed,\" he said, \"we owe to the kindness and\npatience of our friends a debt we can never repay. How cantankerous and\ntroublesome you must have thought me when we were in London! and yet you\nbore with me, then and always, with unfailing sweetness. I can wish you\nnothing better, my dearest cousin, than to be as happy as I am, though I\ndo not know who is fit, by fortune and merit, to deserve you.\"\n\nMary wrote in much the same strain, and Georgiana could read their\nletters without a pang of selfish envy, with no feeling but that of\nrejoicing on her friends' behalf. This was heartily shared in by Mrs.\nWentworth, who proved the most sympathetic of listeners, having seen the\nearly stages of the affair at Bath, and knowing, from her own\nobservation and by what she had collected from Mrs. Darcy's letter, more\nthan Georgiana of the obstacles which had hindered its progress up to\nnow; but both preferred to talk only of its happy conclusion, and of the\nstrange and unexpected means by which it had been brought about.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXVII\n\n\nAbout five weeks after he had posted his letter to Mrs. Wentworth,\nWilliam Price was walking along Wigmore Street, on his way to the\nYates's house in Cavendish Square. It was a cold, foggy evening in\nMarch, and the murky gloom of the wet streets, which the oil lamps at\nintervals rather emphasized than relieved, seemed to William to be a fit\nsurrounding for anyone in his dreary frame of mind. He could not wish\nthe letter unwritten; it was better not to see Georgiana as long as\nthere was the barrier between them raised by what she had told him in\nNovember, that she had never thought of caring for him, believing that\nhe returned Kitty's affection. And yet it was too hard a task not to\nwish to see her again, since he was leaving England the following day on\na voyage which would last for many months. He had no longer any fear of\nhis cousin's rivalry, for during his last visit to Mansfield Tom Bertram\nhad replied, with great coolness, when anxiously interrogated, that on\nthe occasion of his going to Pemberley with the news of Colonel\nFitzwilliam's accident, he had come to the conclusion that he and Miss\nDarcy would not suit. But even if by some dispensation of Providence she\nhad not married anyone else in the course of a year, how could the\nsituation be sufficiently elucidated to set William free ever to address\nher again?\n\nDuring the three months that had elapsed since the Pemberley ball his\nsimple and straightforward nature had wrestled with the most difficult\nproblem he had ever been called upon to face. The great events of his\nlife--the various steps in his career, his sister's marriage, his\nfather's death, and the providing for the family, had all come in the\nnatural order of things, and for him the right line of conduct, as of\nfeeling, had been at the same time the obvious one. And so he had\nsupposed it would be when it came to affairs of the heart. If a man fell\nin love, he would try to win the affection of the woman he had chosen,\nand ask her to marry him; and if she did not care for him enough, he\nmust either give it up, or wait awhile before making another effort. But\nto be refused, because another woman happened to have fallen in love\nwith him! William had accepted his dismissal at the time in sheer\nbewilderment; but the more he thought it over, the more inadequate the\nreason seemed for separating him and Georgiana. She had not absolutely\nsaid that it was impossible to care for him; she had only refused to\nlisten to him or talk of it, which was only natural if she thought him\nin honour bound to Kitty; but William's conscience was perfectly clear\ntowards Kitty, and he tormented himself incessantly with the thought of\nall that he might have done towards gaining Georgiana's affection,\nduring the weeks that they were together, had it not been for this\nwretched misunderstanding. She had taken it all as intended for Kitty;\nwhy had they not seen the truth? Kitty might have seen, everyone might\nhave seen, everyone was deserving of blame, except Georgiana. One moment\nWilliam was marvelling that anyone could have misunderstood what to him\nwas the simplest, most natural thing in the world, and the next had\ndropped back with despair into the thought: \"She might have cared, if\nshe had only known. And now she will not even have forgiven me for\nmaking Miss Kitty unhappy, and I have no chance of setting that right.\"\n\n\"It is just like a ship that has run aground on a sandbank in the fog,\"\nmused William. \"You can't do anything until it has cleared--at least, I\ncan't. If she had refused me out and out, I would have gone down to\nWinchester and had another good try--a fellow who has only three months\non shore to every nine at sea deserves that, I think--but I can't face\nher again as long as I can imagine her saying to herself, 'What about my\npoor Kitty?' Oh, what a blind fool I was, and how I wasted those ten\ndays!\"\n\nHe was so deep in thought that in crossing a side street he almost ran\ninto a gentleman who was going towards Portman Square. Recognition\nfollowed on the mutual apologies, and Mr. Knightley exclaimed: \"Why,\nWilliam! I am glad to see you again--if it can be called seeing in this\natmosphere; I thought you were gone.\"\n\n\"No, sir, but I sail to-morrow from Portsmouth: the _Medusa,_ you know.\nThey altered our destination at the last minute.\"\n\n\"And what is it to be?\"\n\n\"Nova Scotia first, sir; we are taking out a draft to increase the\ngarrison there.\"\n\n\"Lucky fellow that you are; you will have seen the whole world in a year\nor two. I'm afraid it sounds like a long absence this time, but you\nnever mind that, do you?\"\n\n\"Well, sir--\" William hesitated, then looked up with a frank smile--\"it\nwon't be any good, but for once in a way I wish I could get to a home\nstation for a bit.\"\n\nMr. Knightley waited, but perceiving that he was not to hear any more,\nsaid kindly: \"Unless you are in a great hurry, come in and say good-bye\nto Mrs. Knightley; she would be sorry to miss you, especially as you are\nso near.\"\n\nWilliam readily turned back, for apart from the kindness of the\nKnightleys, their house had a special attraction for him; and when a few\nminutes later they entered the drawing-room, his thoughts flew back to\nthe moment when he had first seen Georgiana: she had been standing by\nthat very chair, that velvet screen had been the background to the\nlovely figure in the white ball-dress. It was necessary to put such\nthoughts as these resolutely away, and give his attention to Mrs.\nKnightley, whom they found alone, reading some letters which had just\narrived by the country post. She greeted William cordially, without any\nsurprise at seeing him still in England; it was always a little\ndifficult for Emma to realize that people had important affairs of their\nown; and that they should have had any existence apart from that which\nshe had chosen to imagine for them constituted the surprise. Therefore\nshe looked earnestly and inquiringly at William as he sat down, and made\nso long a pause that he began to wonder what he was expected to say,\nuntil Mr. Knightley came in from the hall, where he had been ordering\nthe servant to bring in lamps, and explained the circumstances of\nWilliam's call. It was then Emma's turn to be astonished: \"Going to sea\nagain, Captain Price? That is indeed a sad thing; I thought you were\ngoing to settle in England for a time; your friends have seen nothing of\nyou.\"\n\n\"There's no such thing as settling in England for a sailor, Mrs.\nKnightley,\" returned William, trying to speak cheerily; \"at least, not\nat twenty-four. And I have been home for a long time now; the North Sea\ncruise this winter counts for nothing, you know.\"\n\n\"The North Sea!\" repeated Emma, still more overwhelmed. \"I thought you\nwere with your mother, or in Derbyshire.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" replied William, in as indifferent a tone as he could. \"I have\nnot been to Derbyshire since the middle of November. We were at\nCopenhagen for three weeks, the rest of the time moving about, and I\nhave just come from spending a week at Mansfield.\"\n\nEmma was then almost speechless with disappointment. Mr. Knightley,\nregretful, but amused, drew his chair up to the fire and began asking\nabout William's plans, which were to leave London on the following\nmorning by the twelve o'clock coach, thus allowing ample time to reach\nPortsmouth and bestow himself and his baggage on board before the ship\nsailed at seven in the evening. Mr. Knightley inquired what would happen\nif he arrived too late, but William could hardly picture the\nconsequences of such a breach of discipline. He had never known it to\nhappen; he supposed the culprit would be court-martialled, and probably\ndegraded three years; he imagined that no circumstances could possibly\nbe allowed to extenuate so grievous a crime. Mr. Knightley suggested\nthat a breakdown of the coach or other conveyance might cause inevitable\ndelay, and William's answer to this was that one took the risk of these\nthings in putting off one's return to the very last day of one's leave;\nsome accident, of course, might occur, but in general, those officers\nwho were not obliged to be on board earlier spent every moment of their\nleave of absence on shore.\n\n\"I probably should have gone back yesterday, however,\" he added, \"but\nthe mother of a friend of mine, Cooper, who is on board the _Queen\nCharlotte_ at Southampton, is very ill in London, and he cannot come to\nsee her, so he asked me to call at the house and bring him the latest\nreports. I was returning from there when I met you this evening. I\nintended going earlier in the day, but I am glad now that I was\nprevented from doing so.\"\n\n\"Emma, my dear,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"you are not appreciating our\nfriend's pretty speeches.\" Emma started, smiled, then tried to rouse\nherself and say something to William in the nature of cordial good\nwishes for his voyage, and in moving her chair, the letters she had been\nreading fell from her knee to the floor. William, as he picked them up,\nreflected that probably something in their contents was occupying Mrs.\nKnightley's mind; and he was beginning to think about making his adieux,\nwhen Mr. Knightley continued, speaking to his wife: \"Have you any\ninteresting news there, as a parting gift for a traveler?\"\n\n\"No, I think not,\" replied Emma. \"This is from Mrs. Weston, but there is\nnothing but Highbury gossip in it, which Captain Price would not--and\nthis other one I have not read; I thought it was Harriet's writing. No!\"\nholding it up to a candle, \"it is not, after all. It is--well--I can\nhardly--it looks like--in fact, I believe it is from Kitty Bennet.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Mr. Knightley, and added, after a momentary pause: \"We\nhave not heard anything of her for a great while.\"\n\nEmma could not help glancing towards William Price, but her glance told\nher nothing, for he sat perfectly passive, looking at no one, with\nperhaps a trifle deeper tinge of colour in his cheeks. The pause\nthreatened to grow embarrassing, so she began to open the letter,\nhurriedly saying: \"Miss Bennet seems still to be in Derbyshire. I should\nhave thought she would have returned home before this.\"\n\n\"You stayed at Pemberley, did you not, William, as well as at Mr.\nBingley's?\" inquired Mr. Knightley.\n\n\"Yes,\" said William. \"Mr. and Mrs. Darcy were so kind as to invite me\nthere with the rest, for their ball. What a beautiful place it is! Even\nat that time of year one was struck with it.\"\n\n\"And you have not seen any of them since, I conclude, as you have been\nabroad,\" proceeded Mr. Knightley.\n\nWilliam was replying in the negative, when stopped by an exclamation\nfrom Mrs. Knightley, who was reading the letter with every sign of\nastonishment. \"George!\" she cried, \"what do you think has happened? You\nwill never guess! It is perfectly amazing! I can hardly believe it\nmyself. Well--!\" as she turned over a page, \"if she had not told me\nherself, I could never--was there ever anything so unexpected?\"\n\n\"We shall know better when you have told us what this astounding news\nis, my dear,\" said her husband. \"Has Miss Bennett become engaged to be\nmarried, by any chance?\"\n\n\"How could you have guessed it?\" exclaimed Mrs. Knightley, dropping the\nletter to gaze at him. \"It is the very last thing I should have thought\nof. Oh, Captain Price!\" remembering her visitor in some confusion. \"But\nI am sure you might know it, as she does not say it is private.\"\n\n\"The reason I guessed it,\" said Mr. Knightley, smiling, \"is because no\nother intelligence causes quite the same amount of excitement, as you\nmust admit, Emma. May we hear some more particulars, now that we have\ngot over the first shock?\" Mr. Knightley was talking partly in order to\nspare his young friend, thinking it just possible that the news of\nKitty's engagement might not be very welcome to the young man.\n\nWilliam, however, was leaning forward with an expression of eager\ninterest, and Mrs. Knightley, looking at her letter, went on: \"She is\nengaged to a Mr. James Morland, the rector of the parish in which Mr.\nand Mrs. Bingley live. He is quite young--only appointed last year--she\nmet him first when she went down there in June--perfectly charming--the\nmost agreeable man she has ever met--does not disapprove of dancing--Mr.\nBingley and her sister so delighted--a lovely old house--so near to dear\nJane--exquisitely happy--she is going home directly, and hopes to come\nto town and see me.\"\n\nWilliam could contain himself no longer. He sprang up, looked at the\nclock, took a few quick steps through the room, then, coming back, he\nabruptly asked: \"Is this really true, Mrs. Knightley?\"\n\n\"Quite true, Captain Price, I am afraid--at least, I mean there can be\nno doubt of it; in fact, they are going to be married in June, she says.\nI assure you, I had not the slightest suspicion. I have only heard the\ngentleman's name once or twice, no more. It is so odd, so\ninexplicable--\"\n\nMr. Knightley could not forbear smiling at his wife's perplexity, for he\nperceived that for some reason or other William was in no need of\ncommiseration, and, indeed, could hardly wait for Mrs. Knightley to\nfinish. Holding out his hand, he said: \"Pray give Miss Bennet my\ncongratulations, and a thousand good wishes for her happiness. I fear I\nmust not stay longer now, so will say good-bye, Mrs. Knightley, with\nmany thanks for all your kindness--I am indeed grateful for all you have\ndone for me.\"\n\n\"But Captain Price, you are not going already?\" exclaimed Emma, now\ncompletely bewildered. \"Do not, I beg, let me drive you away, we will\nnot talk about anything disagreeable. We were just going to have dinner;\nit is late to-night on account of Mr. Knightley's having had to go out,\nand I hoped you would have stayed to dine with us.\"\n\nMr. Knightley seconded the invitation, but William unhesitatingly\ndeclined. \"You are very good, but I must not delay so long. It is only\nsix, and I think I can catch the eight o'clock coach, if I hurry, as my\nthings are nearly packed.\"\n\n\"The eight o'clock coach?\" repeated Mr. Knightley, helping his guest\ninto his coat when it became evident that he was determined to go. \"I\nthought you said you were not returning until to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Yes, I did, but I find now that I shall have to go to Winchester; I\nshall just have time; it is the most fortunate thing that could have\nhappened.\"\n\n\"It is not very fortunate for us,\" said Emma. \"But you surely will not\nattempt to get to Winchester to-night?\"\n\n\"No, but I shall get as far as Guilford, in all probability. I beg your\npardon, Mrs. Knightley, I am shockingly ill-mannered; what must you be\nthinking of me? Do overlook it just this once; nothing but the most\nurgent affairs would carry me away from here so much sooner than I had\nintended.\"\n\nHis smile and winning manner were irresistible, and Emma was obliged to\nlet him go, saying she would expect to hear all about the urgent affairs\nsome day. William seemed to get to the front door in two strides, and\nwas fumbling with the lock before his host could reach him, with offers\nof refreshment, which he would not stay to accept. Mr. Knightley shook\nhands with him, saying kindly: \"Well, William, I am sorry you had to run\naway, especially as we shall not see you for so long. Besides, it is\nreally too cruel, after having whetted our curiosity by this mysterious\nchange of plan.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir, I know it is too bad--if I only had a little more time--but it\nis the sailing to-morrow that is the very mischief--if you knew, you\nwould understand that my only chance is to go now, as quickly as I can.\nI will write and tell you how I get on. Please make my apologies to Mrs.\nKnightley.\"\n\n\"The only thing Mrs. Knightley will not forgive is your having no dinner\nto-night. Yes, indeed, we shall look forward to hearing. Good-bye, and\ngood luck be with you.\"\n\nThe good luck had begun already, William thought, as he plunged into the\nstreets, which no longer appeared dark and foggy, since the aspect of\nthe whole world had changed to him in the last few minutes. Was it not\nthe most extraordinary stroke of good fortune which had led him to meet\nMr. Knightley that evening? He had not intended to call, for he had\nbelieved them to be at their house in the country, and he would have\nheard nothing, and would have passed through Winchester the next day,\nwithin a mile of Georgiana, without knowing that he was free! A day\nlater--the horror of it was almost too great to contemplate--would have\nbeen too late, too late to speak or write, even if anyone had troubled\nto send him the information. Mrs. Knightley herself had not suspected\nthat Miss Bennet's engagement was a matter of such stupendous importance\nto him. William did not trouble to think of what she had suspected, his\nonly idea being to make his way to Georgiana with all speed. He must see\nher before he sailed--that was the pressing necessity; everything else\nwould right itself. What if he did not find her? If she were ill, or\nout of the house, or gone home again? Every kind of apprehension sprang\nup in his mind, to be reasoned away or fought down by vigorous action.\nHis impatience was so great that he hardly knew how he got through the\njourney, beginning with the hasty drive to the coach office, the finding\nthere was a seat still vacant, booking it, and tramping about till the\ntime of starting; the innumerable frets and delays along the road; the\narrival at Guilford, the bespeaking of a post-chaise, and descending\nbefore daylight the next morning to claim it; the hurried breakfast at\nFarnham, and the last interminable twenty miles, until the moment when\nhe drove down the long hill into Winchester and heard the Cathedral\nclock striking eleven.\n\nLeaving his portmanteaux at the \"George,\" he walked straight to the\nWentworths' house, which he knew well from previous visits, and was\nshown into a room where Captain and Mrs. Wentworth sat together. His\nearly appearance created some surprise and excessive pleasure; they were\ntotally unsuspicious of its real cause, and concluded only that he had\nreconsidered his refusal. His eager inquiry as to whether Miss Darcy\nwere still with them, and whether he could see her, aroused a momentary\nfear that he had brought bad news for her, but it speedily became\nevident that he was on quite a different errand.\n\n\"Oho, William, you sly fellow, so it is Miss Darcy you are come to see?\"\nexclaimed Captain Wentworth. \"Well, we congratulate you upon your good\nsense, do we not, Anne? But why in the world did you not come down weeks\nago, when you had the chance?\"\n\nWilliam avoided answering this, and as his friends still did not\nunderstand the urgency of the case, he was obliged again to go through\nthe particulars of the _Medusa_, and Portsmouth, and seven o'clock.\nNow, indeed, were the precious moments not to be wasted; Anne left the\nroom, but returned directly, saying: \"Captain Price, I am very sorry,\nbut I find Miss Darcy has gone out. She talked of wishing to do some\nerrands in the town, but I did not know she had already started. What is\nto be done?\"\n\nWilliam was quite clear that there was only one thing to be done,\nnamely, to go in search of Miss Darcy, and asked which shops she was\nlikely to have visited. Mrs. Wentworth named one or two, and called\nafter him as he was hurrying away, to suggest that if he was not\nsuccessful in finding her in either, it was possible she might, as the\nday was so fine, have gone to finish her walk in the grounds of Wolvesey\nPalace, a favourite spot of hers for a stroll. Armed with information\nWilliam was gone on the instant.\n\nIt was fortunate that he had obtained it, for his inquiries in the High\nStreet were fruitless, and he thereupon retraced his steps under the\narchway and past the Cathedral, turned along College Street, and finally\nfound himself in the old Palace gardens, where, seated with a book among\na quiet part of the ruins, he presently came upon Georgiana. She did not\nsee him until he was close at hand, when she sprang up, scarce able to\nbelieve her eyes, and the colour deepening in her cheeks; and William\nforgetting all the lengthy explanations he had intended to make, darted\ntowards her, impulsively exclaiming: \"Oh, how glad I am to see you\nagain! I came back--I could not help it--everything is all right--you\nwill let me speak now--am I too late? Have I the least chance--any\nchance at all?\"\n\nGeorgiana unconsciously yielded her hand to his, but shrank back a\nlittle as she faltered: \"But--but Kitty?\"\n\nBreathless from haste, and full of anxiety as to his reception, William\nhardly knew whether he had been intelligible, but there was something\nin Georgiana's look which showed him, even while she hesitated, that he\nwas understood--even more--welcomed. Her very question was an answer to\nhim, and that he quickly disposed of it, and yet in a manner entirely\nsatisfactory to her, could not be doubted, making thereby the glorious\ndiscovery that his cause was won, when he had been almost ready to\ndespair of achieving anything in the short time at his command.\n\nIt seemed at first impossible that it could be true, but the surprise of\nreceiving a good fortune beyond one's deserts is one to which it is easy\nto grow accustomed. The fact of Kitty's engagement, once realized, could\nbe put aside as something delightful to be thought over at leisure; but\nfor the present moment there were only two people in the world, and\nthose two could give themselves up, unchecked by any sense of guilt or\nresponsibility, to the exquisite happiness of love acknowledged and\nreturned. Perfect confidence might now exist between them; William might\nrepeat, and far more eloquently, all that he had said in the picture\ngallery at Pemberley; and Georgiana might now venture to confess the\nfeelings which in that interview had awakened to life. To her, indeed,\nit was easier to listen than to talk, for after her long\nself-repression, the relief, the wonderful change, were almost\noverwhelming; her heart had been too deeply stirred, and her habitual\nshyness was not soon to be overcome. But William's joy in the fruition\nof his hopes, so infinitely more complete than any he had dared to hope\nfor, and his gratitude to herself, had to be put into words in his own\nfrank and eager way, touched now with the earnest gravity befitting so\ngreat an occasion.\n\nIt was one of those beautiful mornings which sometimes occur in the\nungenial early months of the year, as a reminder that spring is\nactually on its way. By noon, the pale sunshine had some warmth, and the\nlovers paced to and fro, or sat in the sheltered corner which had seen\ntheir meeting, while a soft breeze rustled in the ivy and the murmuring\nof the stream could be heard just beyond the old wall. Georgiana lifted\na face of delight to the blue sky, and watched the rooks busy in the elm\ntrees near, while occasionally other sounds came to them, unnoticed at\nthe time, but being woven into the picture which their memories would\nalways hold of that hour, voices, gay with youth and spirits, of the\ncollege boys as they passed in and out of their gateway, and the slow\nsweet chimes from the tower of the Cathedral.\n\nGeorgiana knew something of William's plans, but to learn that their\nparting must take place almost immediately was indeed a blow, until\nconsoling reflections came, and they reminded each other of what a trial\nof faith and patience his departure in other circumstances would have\nmeant. Of course, it would have made no real difference; neither would\nadmit the possibility of its having caused any change in their feelings,\nbut there was comfort in knowing that now theirs was an attachment which\nseparations could only strengthen, and in the light of which\nmisunderstandings could no longer exist. Both lamented William's being\nunable to see Mr. and Mrs. Darcy before he sailed, but Georgiana\nanticipated no opposition on their part, and this thought gave perhaps\nthe crowning touch to a felicity so intense that she could hardly\nbelieve it to be hers.\n\nCaptain and Mrs. Wentworth's warmth of kindness was to be expected, in\nview of their affection for both the young people. William stayed with\nthem until four o'clock, which gave time for many plans to be made, and\nthe more important letters to be written, and when at last he said his\nfarewells he buoyed himself and Georgiana up with the promise that it\nshould be no more than six months before he returned to claim her.\n\nWhen he had actually gone, she went to her room, feeling in need of\nsolitude to compose her mind after a day of such wonders. It was\nimpossible that she should not let fall a few tears at the thought of\nWilliam's going every moment farther and farther from her when they had\nonly just begun to realize the delight, the security of their new\nrelation to each other, but they were not the bitter tears of\nhopelessness that she had so often shed in the last few months.\n\nWhatever the period of his absence, it would be long, and the lot of the\none left behind, inactive, would be the hardest; but Georgiana was\nwilling to wait in thankfulness and quiet trust for whatever the future\nmight bring. That there might be anxieties and alarms, she knew, but the\nheart which had once and for all been given to William Price was strong\nin courage as in tenderness, and the remembrance of the vows they had\nexchanged had glorified her life.\n\nElizabeth and Mr. Darcy came to Winchester shortly afterwards, to take\nher home. Her news, while explaining many things, had been a\nconsiderable surprise to them, and Darcy deemed it necessary to make\nfurther inquiries about the young man, who, it appeared, now desired to\nbe even more closely connected with his family than had at first been\nthought. Though regretting, for his sister's sake, the profession of the\nman she had chosen, he could not withhold his approval when she had\nconvinced him how completely her happiness was bound up in the affair;\nand, indeed, he could hear nothing on any side but what was in Captain\nPrice's favour, so while Lady Catherine, who had made a show of\nobjection, was appeased by the substantial fortune and the relationship\nwith the Bertrams, Darcy and Elizabeth found contentment in their\nknowledge of his character and position.\n\nAll went as delightfully as Georgiana could have wished. Darcy, who had\nbeen inclined to regret Mr. Bertram's dismissal when he first heard of\nit, became so entirely reconciled to the idea of his cousin as a\nsubstitute, that Georgiana never heard a word of the dreaded scolding;\nand Captain Wentworth promised that all his own, and his brother-in-law,\nAdmiral Croft's, interest should be used towards hastening William's\npromotion and shortening his absence, for he declared it would be\nimpossible to do too much for a lady who, in spite of early prejudices,\nwas venturing to trust so far in the fidelity of sailors as actually to\nbe going to marry one of them.\n\nGeorgiana had many questions to ask about Kitty's engagement, and from\nwhat Elizabeth told her of the particulars given by Jane, she was able\nto piece the story together for herself. Morland had sincerely tried to\nforget Kitty, but her return to Desborough, more bewitching than ever,\nhad shown him how vain had been his efforts. And when the intimacy\nbetween the Rectory and the Park had been renewed under his sister's\nauspices, what wonder if Kitty's feelings towards him changed somewhat\nwith the changed circumstances? If, touched by his continued devotion,\nand a little piqued by the want of appreciation in another quarter, she\nhad allowed him to see that a second attempt would not be treated like\nthe first? Georgiana rejoiced to think that Kitty had the power of\nconsoling herself, and that she was at that moment adoring Mr. Morland\nas whole-heartedly as she had ever adored Mr. Price.\n\nThe two girls exchanged letters of congratulations, but it was no longer\npossible to write with quite the same openness as of old, though\nGeorgiana's good wishes lacked nothing of affectionate sincerity. Kitty\ndeclared herself too busy with the preparation of her wedding clothes to\nsend a long letter, and perhaps also a small feeling of resentment\nlingered in her mind, and prompted the remark: \"I thought you must have\nbeen in love with him all the time, though you would not admit it.\"\n\nShe had, however, nothing to envy Georgiana, for had she not achieved\nthe distinction of being the first of the three brides? The ceremony at\nthe parish church near Longbourn was fixed for Midsummer, and was\nattended by a number of relatives and friends; while the Darcys soon\nafter had the pleasure of witnessing the marriage of Mary Crawford and\nColonel Fitzwilliam, which took place in London in the following month.\nThe latter couple settled in town, but also possessed themselves of a\nsmall hunting lodge in Leicestershire, whence the road to Pemberley and\nback was frequently traversed, though it is to be hoped with less haste\nand agitation than by two persons who made the journey on a certain\nmelancholy day in January.\n\nIt was long before William learned the true history of his cousin's\nsecond visit to Pemberley, but Georgiana could afford to smile at the\nrecollection of it, when, some three months after the announcement of\nher engagement, the families of Darcy and Bingley received the wedding\ncards of Mr. Thomas Bertram and Miss Isabella Thorpe.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Old Friends an New Fancies, by Sybil G.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":655,"split":"train"}
