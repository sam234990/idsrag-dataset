{"ori_id":"a0922808f19fd6e42227cfe448757bb43788eb5d","title":"Blood and Wine","context":"Blood and Wine\n Alex Gates (Jack Nicholson) is a wine merchant living in Miami who has distanced himself from his alcoholic wife Suzanne (Judy Davis) with his philandering, and from his stepson Jason (Stephen Dorff) with his indifference. Alex is heavily in debt, and hatches a plan to steal a valuable diamond necklace from the house of his clients, the Reese family, where his Cuban mistress Gabriela (Jennifer Lopez) works. He cases the house during a wine delivery with Jason, who works in Alex's business, although not happily. Jason becomes attracted to Gabriela, unaware of her relationship with his father.\nOn the day of the heist, Alex and his safe-cracker partner Victor (Michael Caine) arrive at the house under the pretense that the Reeses' wine cellar needs repairs, otherwise their wine will be ruined. Gabriela was supposed to let them in, but she was fired the day before. Fortunately, Alex had cultivated a relationship with the security guard and is able to convince him to admit them. Victor sends Alex and the guard off on an errand while he works on the safe, but a second guard becomes suspicious, although Victor is able to complete the job before being discovered.\nThe pair decide that Alex will pawn the necklace in New York City, and he invites Gabriela to go with him. As he is packing, Suzanne chances upon the airline tickets for him and Gabriela and immediately realizes he is having another affair. The two of them get into a physical alteration and she knocks him out. Deciding to leave him, she empties out his suitcase, where he has hidden the necklace, and uses it for her own clothes. Jason walks in and the two of them flee to the Florida Keys. Upon arriving, they discover the necklace, but Suzanne doesn't want to keep it, even after Jason has it appraised, discovering it is worth $1 million. Jason also visits Gabriela back in Miami, giving her the phone number of the place they are staying at.\nVictor and Alex meet with Jason's friend Henry (Harold Perrineau). Alex assaults Henry in an attempt to learn Jason's whereabouts, but Henry doesn't know anything. The pair contact various jewelers to be on the lookout for the necklace and get a report from the jeweler who gave Jason the appraisal. Arriving in Key Largo, Victor pretends to flirt with Suzanne, but Jason, who has gotten a description of Henry's assailant, realizes who Victor is and after a fight, escapes with his mother in their car. Victor and Alex give chase and cause an accident that kills Suzanne. Although injured, Jason discharges himself from the hospital and returns to Miami to fight with his father, only to find Gabriela in Alex's bed. After a brief argument, they reconcile.\nAlex returns home to find both Jason and Gabriela there and he accuses them of having sex. Meanwhile, Victor has been following Jason and confronts him alone. Jason convinces him that he has returned the necklace to Alex, although he has done no such thing. Victor then goes to Alex's house. The two of them fight and Victor is killed. Later, Gabriela visits Jason, and he shows her the necklace. The next day, she calls Alex to tell him its location. They arrive at Jason's boat and Alex and Jason fight, during which time Alex is critically injured. Gabriela leaves the necklace with him as she runs away. With an ambulance on the way, Alex realizes he has no choice but to dispose of the evidence and throws the necklace into the ocean.\n<html>\n<head><title>Blood and Wine Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Blood and Wine script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Blood and Wine script, Blood and Wine movie script, Blood and Wine film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The hands rinse the\n          towel in a copper bar sink. The stains soften but stay.\n          A tan jacket sleeve, spotted the same way, moves INTO\n          FRAM. The hands dab the wet towel at the spots, with no\n          more success, and throw it into the sink. It falls half\n          in, still dripping the stains a drop at a time to the\n          floor.\n\n<b>          ALL IN CLOSEUP\n<\/b>          The owner of the hands walks to a wine rack, opens a\n          bottle of white wine, drizzles the wine on the jacket\n          sleeve. The stains disappear. He hangs his jacket on a\n          hook and walks from\n\n<b>                         THE CELLAR\n<\/b>          and up the narrow stairs. His FOOTFALLS ECHO against the\n          unadorned cement block walls. We see his shape, mid-\n          forties, powerful, his shirt pulled out. He's carrying\n          the open bottle by the neck.\n\n<b>          2 INT. WINE STORE - NIGHT\n<\/b>\n          Still seen from behind, the man emerges from the cellar\n          into a contrastingly elegant space with a wood-beamed.\n          ceiling, vaguely European. He walks along a narrow aisle\n          of wooden diamond bins. As the space widens his foot hits\n          something in his path. He bends to find a shoe. He\n          glances about nervously. There are shutters on the\n          storefront windows. Shoe in hand, he tightens the\n          shutters. We see his profile, a good-looking man.\n          He walks toward a brighter room at the back of the store,\n          the Tasting Room. Now he retrieves a pair of women's\n          trousers from the floor, and as he straightens up we see\n          his entire face, genial, venial, redeemed by his smile.\n          ALEX GATES. He speaks nonchalantly toward the room.\n\n<b>                         ALEX\n<\/b>          Twenty people tonight.

He throws the bottle away.\n\n<b>                         (CONTINUED)\n<\/b>\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n<b>           2.\n<\/b>\n<b>                          2\n<\/b>\n<b>                         2 CONTINUED:\n<\/b>          There's a basket of baguettes on the counter.

She shrugs away from his\n          hand. Jason has hooked a ten-foot, three-finned sea beast\n          with a spade-shaped head and black eyes on each side. He\n          attaches the line to a winch and winds it up onto the\n          deck. It twists wildly, knocking things over until it\n          slows down and finally lies very still. His chest heaving\n          with the effort, Jason looks around. Alex has disappeared\n          without either of them noticing.\n\n<b>          216 INT.

He\n          FIRES his GUN over and over until it's empty.

Much as he hates\n          Alex, Jason can't let him die. like this. He charges.\n          forward and straddles the shark, jams the blade of his\n          knife into the primordial brain. He twists the handle\n          once. The shark dies instantly. Trembling with\n          adrenalin, Jason gets off its back. With his elbows Alex\n          drags himself out of the jaws.

She has a flare gun, no\n          longer needed, and sheets from the cabin to stop the\n          bleeding. She starts to tear them up.
