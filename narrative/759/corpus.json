{"ori_id":"b226a96934d19f6cd7df811de317413de58de5ec","title":"Burlesque (2010 American film)","context":"Burlesque (2010 American film)\n Ali Rose (Aguilera) moves to Los Angeles after she quits her bar job when her boss refuses to pay her. Once in L.A., she tries and fails at every audition she does until one night, she finds herself unknowingly in a burlesque club when she hears the music on the street. She finds Tess (Cher) and the dancers performing \u201cWelcome to Burlesque\u201d and decides to pursue a career on stage once she meets Jack (Gigandet). Jack refers her to Tess for an audition, but she is rejected instantly and ushered out by Sean (Tucci). Instead of leaving, Ali begins serving customers at the club as a waitress, while Tess and Sean observe with Jack asking Tess to give Ali a chance.\nWhen Georgia (Hough) becomes pregnant, auditions are held to replace her. Ali begins her audition when everyone leaves, and after performing \"Wagon Wheel Watusi\", persuades Tess to allow her to become one of the club's dancers, much to the annoyance of Nikki (Bell), a performer who is always late and caught drinking before numbers. One day Ali has to replace Nikki on stage because Nikki is too drunk to perform. Nikki sabotages the performance by turning off the music that the dancers usually lip sync to but before the curtain is dropped down, Ali impresses everyone with her amazing singing skills. Tess immediately decides to have Ali be the star of a whole new show at the club. It becomes increasingly popular and Ali enjoys her newfound stardom while Nikki fumes in the background. Despite the club's growing success, Tess is still unable to pay the bank all the money that she owes it.\nOne night after the club closes, Tess, worried with the club's economic prospects, sings \"You Haven't Seen the Last of Me\". A very jealous Nikki shows up drunk and picks a fight with Tess, calling Ali a \"slut with mutant lungs\". Tess, who has grown frustrated with Nikki, questions her gratitude for the help she has received. Angered, Nikki quits on the spot (before falsely claiming that she slept with Vince after his and Tess's honeymoon), and the altercation ends when Tess angrily retaliates by smashing the passenger side window on Nikki's convertible with a crowbar.\nTensions arise between Ali and Jack as Marcus grows increasingly infatuated with Ali, making Jack jealous. At Georgia's wedding, Jack appears to call off his engagement, getting drunk. That night, Ali and Jack sleep together, but the following morning Jack's fianc\u00e9, Natalie (Agron), returns unexpectedly from her play in New York and tells Ali that the engagement is still on. Jack denies this, and while trying to fix things, he asks Ali to leave. Feeling heartbroken and betrayed, Ali runs to Sean for support, who prompts her to go with Marcus after his phone call.\nWhile spending time with Marcus, Ali finds out about \"air rights\", which refers to the empty space above a building and what can be done with it. Ali breaks things off with Marcus after she sees his plans to build a skyscraper on the property the club is on. Ali tells Tess, and together they inform the owner of the new million-dollar condos across the street; fearing the loss of business that would result from the obstruction of his prospective tenants' view, he purchases the air rights to the club's property. The resulting money is enough for Tess to buy out Vince's share, pay off the bank, and re-fashion the club to her own vision. She also makes up with Nikki and rehires her at the club. In the end Ali, having reunited with Jack and earned Nikki's respect, performs \"Show Me How You Burlesque\" with all of the dancers, a song which Jack wrote and finally finished.\n<html>\n<head><title>Burlesque Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Burlesque script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Burlesque script, Burlesque movie script, Burlesque film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

And Ali nods back. For the first time, a\n          mutual respect.\n          All the other girls begin to pour into the dressing room.\n          Chatting, gossiping, changing their clothes. The legs, boobs,\n          fishnets, etc. Things back the way there were, and the way\n          they'll always be.\n          ON ALI. She looks at herself in the mirror. Picks up the make-\n          up brush Tess gave her. Dips it in water. Then applies a line\n          on her eye expertly. She smiles to herself. MUSIC UP: A heavy\n          bass drumlin beat which takes us to...\n\n<b>          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT - CARRY MUSIC\n<\/b>\n          A SPOTLIGHT. MOVING down the smoke-filled shaft of light as--\n          A FIGURE RISES into view at the back of the stage. Over the\n          contemporary BEAT, we HEAR a beautiful classic opera\n          (Carmen?) REVEAL...it's NIKKI! She sings a line or two in an\n          amazing operatic voice that totally blows us away. Then ...a\n          DANCE BEAT KICKS IN as COCO comes into view, and sings\n          another line. Then Jessie. Then Scarlett. And FINALLY...\n          Ali RISES into view, wearing a diamond studded Gaultier-type\n          harness top and sequined hot-pants. This song (to be written)\n          is a contemporary dance song about BURLESQUE with a vintage\n          feel to it. Nikki and the Burlesque Girls, in similar\n          costumes, back Ali as she SINGS her big finale. CAMERA MOVES\n          through the packed house as we SEE Georgia, Sean, Mark (the\n          DJ) and Tess, who double-takes at MR.
