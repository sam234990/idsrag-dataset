The desk is subsequently stolen, as it turns out, by Ars\u0102\u00a8ne Lupin. Later, both Lupin and the professor realize that a lottery ticket, left inadvertently in the desk, is the winning ticket, and Lupin proceeds to ensure he obtains half of the winnings while executing a near-impossible escape with a blonde lady. After the theft of the Blue Diamond, again by a blonde lady, Ganimard made the connection to Lupin and an appeal was made to Herlock Sholmes to match wits with Lupin. Inadvertently, Lupin and his biographer met with the newly arrived Sholmes and his assistant, Wilson, in a Parisian restaurant, and they shared a cautious d\u0102\u0160tente before Lupin sets off to lay his traps. Despite Lupin's efforts, Sholmes is able to unveil the identity of the blonde lady and Lupin's involvement in the crimes linked to her. Lupin succeeded in trapping Sholmes, however, and sends him off to Southampton in a boat, but Sholmes manages to escape back to Paris and engineer the arrest of Lupin. After Sholmes leaves, however, Lupin outfoxes his French captors and manages to bid farewell to Sholmes and Wilson at the Gare du Nord.\n\"The Jewish Lamp\" opens with another appeal to Herlock Sholmes for help in recovering a Jewish lamp. After reading the appeal, Sholmes is shocked to read a second letter, this time by Lupin and arriving on the same day's post, which warns him not to intervene. Sholmes is outraged by Lupin's audacity and resolves to go to Paris. At the Gare du Nord, Sholmes is accosted by a young lady, who again warns him not to intervene, and finds that the Echo de France, Lupin's mouthpiece newspaper, is proclaiming his arrival. Sholmes proceeds to investigate the crime and finds out the true reason for Lupin's appeal not to intervene.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin versus Herlock Sholmes, by Maurice LeBlanc\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Gerbois, professor of\nmathematics at the College of Versailles, while rummaging in an old\ncuriosity-shop, unearthed a small mahogany writing-desk which pleased\nhim very much on account of the multiplicity of its drawers.\n\n\"Just the thing for Suzanne's birthday present,\" thought he. And as he\nalways tried to furnish some simple pleasures for his daughter,\nconsistent with his modest income, he enquired the price, and, after\nsome keen bargaining, purchased it for sixty-five francs. As he was\ngiving his address to the shopkeeper, a young man, dressed with elegance\nand taste, who had been exploring the stock of antiques, caught sight\nof the writing-desk, and immediately enquired its price.\n\n\"It is sold,\" replied the shopkeeper.\n\n\"Ah! to this gentleman, I presume?\"\n\nMonsieur Gerbois bowed, and left the store, quite proud to be the\npossessor of an article which had attracted the attention of a gentleman\nof quality. But he had not taken a dozen steps in the street, when he\nwas overtaken by the young man who, hat in hand and in a tone of perfect\ncourtesy, thus addressed him:\n\n\"I beg your pardon, monsieur; I am going to ask you a question that you\nmay deem impertinent. It is this: Did you have any special object in\nview when you bought that writing-desk?\"\n\n\"No, I came across it by chance and it struck my fancy.\"\n\n\"But you do not care for it particularly?\"\n\n\"Oh! I shall keep it--that is all.\"\n\n\"Because it is an antique, perhaps?\"\n\n\"No; because it is convenient,\" declared Mon. Gerbois.\n\n\"In that case, you would consent to exchange it for another desk that\nwould be quite as convenient and in better condition?\"\n\n\"Oh! this one is in good condition, and I see no object in making an\nexchange.\"\n\n\"But----\"\n\nMon. Gerbois is a man of irritable disposition and hasty temper. So he\nreplied, testily:\n\n\"I beg of you, monsieur, do not insist.\"\n\nBut the young man firmly held his ground.\n\n\"I don't know how much you paid for it, monsieur, but I offer you\ndouble.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Three times the amount.\"\n\n\"Oh! that will do,\" exclaimed the professor, impatiently; \"I don't wish\nto sell it.\"\n\nThe young man stared at him for a moment in a manner that Mon. Gerbois\nwould not readily forget, then turned and walked rapidly away.\n\nAn hour later, the desk was delivered at the professor's house on the\nViroflay road. He called his daughter, and said:\n\n\"Here is something for you, Suzanne, provided you like it.\"\n\nSuzanne was a pretty girl, with a gay and affectionate nature. She threw\nher arms around her father's neck and kissed him rapturously. To her,\nthe desk had all the semblance of a royal gift. That evening, assisted\nby Hortense, the servant, she placed the desk in her room; then she\ndusted it, cleaned the drawers and pigeon-holes, and carefully arranged\nwithin it her papers, writing material, correspondence, a collection of\npost-cards, and some souvenirs of her cousin Philippe that she kept in\nsecret.\n\nNext morning, at half past seven, Mon. Gerbois went to the college. At\nten o'clock, in pursuance of her usual custom, Suzanne went to meet him,\nand it was a great pleasure for him to see her slender figure and\nchildish smile waiting for him at the college gate. They returned home\ntogether.\n\n\"And your writing desk--how is it this morning?\"\n\n\"Marvellous! Hortense and I have polished the brass mountings until they\nlook like gold.\"\n\n\"So you are pleased with it?\"\n\n\"Pleased with it! Why, I don't see how I managed to get on without it\nfor such a long time.\"\n\nAs they were walking up the pathway to the house, Mon. Gerbois said:\n\n\"Shall we go and take a look at it before breakfast?\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, that's a splendid idea!\"\n\nShe ascended the stairs ahead of her father, but, on arriving at the\ndoor of her room, she uttered a cry of surprise and dismay.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" stammered Mon. Gerbois.\n\n\"The writing-desk is gone!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the police were called in, they were astonished at the admirable\nsimplicity of the means employed by the thief. During Suzanne's absence,\nthe servant had gone to market, and while the house was thus left\nunguarded, a drayman, wearing a badge--some of the neighbors saw\nit--stopped his cart in front of the house and rang twice. Not knowing\nthat Hortense was absent, the neighbors were not suspicious;\nconsequently, the man carried on his work in peace and tranquility.\n\nApart from the desk, not a thing in the house had been disturbed. Even\nSuzanne's purse, which she had left upon the writing-desk, was found\nupon an adjacent table with its contents untouched. It was obvious that\nthe thief had come with a set purpose, which rendered the crime even\nmore mysterious; because, why did he assume so great a risk for such a\ntrifling object?\n\nThe only clue the professor could furnish was the strange incident of\nthe preceding evening. He declared:\n\n\"The young man was greatly provoked at my refusal, and I had an idea\nthat he threatened me as he went away.\"\n\nBut the clue was a vague one. The shopkeeper could not throw any light\non the affair. He did not know either of the gentlemen. As to the desk\nitself, he had purchased it for forty francs at an executor's sale at\nChevreuse, and believed he had resold it at its fair value. The police\ninvestigation disclosed nothing more.\n\nBut Mon. Gerbois entertained the idea that he had suffered an enormous\nloss. There must have been a fortune concealed in a secret drawer, and\nthat was the reason the young man had resorted to crime.\n\n\"My poor father, what would we have done with that fortune?\" asked\nSuzanne.\n\n\"My child! with such a fortune, you could make a most advantageous\nmarriage.\"\n\nSuzanne sighed bitterly. Her aspirations soared no higher than her\ncousin Philippe, who was indeed a most deplorable object. And life, in\nthe little house at Versailles, was not so happy and contented as of\nyore.\n\nTwo months passed away. Then came a succession of startling events, a\nstrange blending of good luck and dire misfortune!\n\nOn the first day of February, at half-past five, Mon. Gerbois entered\nthe house, carrying an evening paper, took a seat, put on his\nspectacles, and commenced to read. As politics did not interest him, he\nturned to the inside of the paper. Immediately his attention was\nattracted by an article entitled:\n\n\"Third Drawing of the Press Association Lottery.\n\n\"No. 514, series 23, draws a million.\"\n\nThe newspaper slipped from his fingers. The walls swam before his eyes,\nand his heart ceased to beat. He held No. 514, series 23. He had\npurchased it from a friend, to oblige him, without any thought of\nsuccess, and behold, it was the lucky number!\n\nQuickly, he took out his memorandum-book. Yes, he was quite right. The\nNo. 514, series 23, was written there, on the inside of the cover. But\nthe ticket?\n\nHe rushed to his desk to find the envelope-box in which he had placed\nthe precious ticket; but the box was not there, and it suddenly occurred\nto him that it had not been there for several weeks. He heard footsteps\non the gravel walk leading from the street.\n\nHe called:\n\n\"Suzanne! Suzanne!\"\n\nShe was returning from a walk. She entered hastily. He stammered, in a\nchoking voice:\n\n\"Suzanne ... the box ... the box of envelopes?\"\n\n\"What box?\"\n\n\"The one I bought at the Louvre ... one Saturday ... it was at the end\nof that table.\"\n\n\"Don't you remember, father, we put all those things away together.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"The evening ... you know ... the same evening....\"\n\n\"But where?... Tell me, quick!... Where?\"\n\n\"Where? Why, in the writing-desk.\"\n\n\"In the writing-desk that was stolen?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Oh, mon Dieu!... In the stolen desk!\"\n\nHe uttered the last sentence in a low voice, in a sort of stupor. Then\nhe seized her hand, and in a still lower voice, he said:\n\n\"It contained a million, my child.\"\n\n\"Ah! father, why didn't you tell me?\" she murmured, naively.\n\n\"A million!\" he repeated. \"It contained the ticket that drew the grand\nprize in the Press Lottery.\"\n\nThe colossal proportions of the disaster overwhelmed them, and for a\nlong time they maintained a silence that they feared to break. At last,\nSuzanne said:\n\n\"But, father, they will pay you just the same.\"\n\n\"How? On what proof?\"\n\n\"Must you have proof?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"And you haven't any?\"\n\n\"It was in the box.\"\n\n\"In the box that has disappeared.\"\n\n\"Yes; and now the thief will get the money.\"\n\n\"Oh! that would be terrible, father. You must prevent it.\"\n\nFor a moment he was silent; then, in an outburst of energy, he leaped\nup, stamped on the floor, and exclaimed:\n\n\"No, no, he shall not have that million; he shall not have it! Why\nshould he have it? Ah! clever as he is, he can do nothing. If he goes to\nclaim the money, they will arrest him. Ah! now, we will see, my fine\nfellow!\"\n\n\"What will you do, father?\"\n\n\"Defend our just rights, whatever happens! And we will succeed. The\nmillion francs belong to me, and I intend to have them.\"\n\nA few minutes later, he sent this telegram:\n\n     \"Governor Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Foncier\n\n     \"rue Capucines, Paris.\n\n     \"Am holder of No. 514, series 23. Oppose by all legal means any\n     other claimant.\n\n     \"GERBOIS.\"\n\nAlmost at the same moment, the Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Foncier received the following\ntelegram:\n\n     \"No. 514, series 23, is in my possession.\n\n     \"ARS\u00c3\u0088NE LUPIN.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEvery time I undertake to relate one of the many extraordinary\nadventures that mark the life of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin, I experience a feeling of\nembarrassment, as it seems to me that the most commonplace of those\nadventures is already well known to my readers. In fact, there is not a\nmovement of our \"national thief,\" as he has been so aptly described,\nthat has not been given the widest publicity, not an exploit that has\nnot been studied in all its phases, not an action that has not been\ndiscussed with that particularity usually reserved for the recital of\nheroic deeds.\n\nFor instance, who does not know the strange history of \"The Blonde\nLady,\" with those curious episodes which were proclaimed by the\nnewspapers with heavy black headlines, as follows: \"Lottery Ticket No.\n514!\" ... \"The Crime on the Avenue Henri-Martin!\" ... \"The Blue\nDiamond!\" ... The interest created by the intervention of the celebrated\nEnglish detective, Herlock Sholmes! The excitement aroused by the\nvarious vicissitudes which marked the struggle between those famous\nartists! And what a commotion on the boulevards, the day on which the\nnewsboys announced: \"Arrest of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin!\"\n\nMy excuse for repeating these stories at this time is the fact that I\nproduce the key to the enigma. Those adventures have always been\nenveloped in a certain degree of obscurity, which I now remove. I\nreproduce old newspaper articles, I relate old-time interviews, I\npresent ancient letters; but I have arranged and classified all that\nmaterial and reduced it to the exact truth. My collaborators in this\nwork have been Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin himself, and also the ineffable Wilson, the\nfriend and confidant of Herlock Sholmes.\n\nEvery one will recall the tremendous burst of laughter which greeted the\npublication of those two telegrams. The name \"Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin\" was in\nitself a stimulus to curiosity, a promise of amusement for the gallery.\nAnd, in this case, the gallery means the entire world.\n\nAn investigation was immediately commenced by the Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Foncier, which\nestablished these facts: That ticket No. 514, series 23, had been sold\nby the Versailles branch office of the Lottery to an artillery officer\nnamed Bessy, who was afterward killed by a fall from his horse. Some\ntime before his death, he informed some of his comrades that he had\ntransferred his ticket to a friend.\n\n\"And I am that friend,\" affirmed Mon. Gerbois.\n\n\"Prove it,\" replied the governor of the Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Foncier.\n\n\"Of course I can prove it. Twenty people can tell you that I was an\nintimate friend of Monsieur Bessy, and that we frequently met at the\nCaf\u00c3\u00a9 de la Place-d'Armes. It was there, one day, I purchased the ticket\nfrom him for twenty francs--simply as an accommodation to him.\n\n\"Have you any witnesses to that transaction?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, how do you expect to prove it?\"\n\n\"By a letter he wrote to me.\"\n\n\"What letter?\"\n\n\"A letter that was pinned to the ticket.\"\n\n\"Produce it.\"\n\n\"It was stolen at the same time as the ticket.\"\n\n\"Well, you must find it.\"\n\nIt was soon learned that Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin had the letter. A short paragraph\nappeared in the _Echo de France_--which has the honor to be his official\norgan, and of which, it is said, he is one of the principal\nshareholders--the paragraph announced that Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin had placed in\nthe hands of Monsieur Detinan, his advocate and legal adviser, the\nletter that Monsieur Bessy had written to him--to him personally.\n\nThis announcement provoked an outburst of laughter. Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin had\nengaged a lawyer! Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin, conforming to the rules and customs of\nmodern society, had appointed a legal representative in the person of a\nwell-known member of the Parisian bar!\n\nMon. Detinan had never enjoyed the pleasure of meeting Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin--a\nfact he deeply regretted--but he had actually been retained by that\nmysterious gentleman and felt greatly honored by the choice. He was\nprepared to defend the interests of his client to the best of his\nability. He was pleased, even proud, to exhibit the letter of Mon.\nBessy, but, although it proved the transfer of the ticket, it did not\nmention the name of the purchaser. It was simply addressed to \"My Dear\nFriend.\"\n\n\"My Dear Friend! that is I,\" added Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin, in a note attached to\nMon. Bessy's letter. \"And the best proof of that fact is that I hold the\nletter.\"\n\nThe swarm of reporters immediately rushed to see Mon. Gerbois, who could\nonly repeat:\n\n\"My Dear Friend! that is I.... Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin stole the letter with the\nlottery ticket.\"\n\n\"Let him prove it!\" retorted Lupin to the reporters.\n\n\"He must have done it, because he stole the writing-desk!\" exclaimed\nMon. Gerbois before the same reporters.\n\n\"Let him prove it!\" replied Lupin.\n\nSuch was the entertaining comedy enacted by the two claimants of ticket\nNo. 514; and the calm demeanor of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin contrasted strangely with\nthe nervous perturbation of poor Mon. Gerbois. The newspapers were\nfilled with the lamentations of that unhappy man. He announced his\nmisfortune with pathetic candor.\n\n\"Understand, gentlemen, it was Suzanne's dowry that the rascal stole!\nPersonally, I don't care a straw for it,... but for Suzanne! Just think\nof it, a whole million! Ten times one hundred thousand francs! Ah! I\nknew very well that the desk contained a treasure!\"\n\nIt was in vain to tell him that his adversary, when stealing the desk,\nwas unaware that the lottery ticket was in it, and that, in any event,\nhe could not foresee that the ticket would draw the grand prize. He\nwould reply;\n\n\"Nonsense! of course, he knew it ... else why would he take the trouble\nto steal a poor, miserable desk?\"\n\n\"For some unknown reason; but certainly not for a small scrap of paper\nwhich was then worth only twenty francs.\"\n\n\"A million francs! He knew it;... he knows everything! Ah! you do not\nknow him--the scoundrel!... He hasn't robbed you of a million francs!\"\n\nThe controversy would have lasted for a much longer time, but, on the\ntwelfth day, Mon. Gerbois received from Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin a letter, marked\n\"confidential,\" which read as follows:\n\n     \"Monsieur, the gallery is being amused at our expense. Do you not\n     think it is time for us to be serious? The situation is this: I\n     possess a ticket to which I have no legal right, and you have the\n     legal right to a ticket you do not possess. Neither of us can do\n     anything. You will not relinquish your rights to me; I will not\n     deliver the ticket to you. Now, what is to be done?\n\n     \"I see only one way out of the difficulty: Let us divide the\n     spoils. A half-million for you; a half-million for me. Is not that\n     a fair division? In my opinion, it is an equitable solution, and an\n     immediate one. I will give you three days' time to consider the\n     proposition. On Thursday morning I shall expect to read in the\n     personal column of the Echo de France a discreet message addressed\n     to _M. Ars. Lup_, expressing in veiled terms your consent to my\n     offer. By so doing you will recover immediate possession of the\n     ticket; then you can collect the money and send me half a million\n     in a manner that I will describe to you later.\n\n     \"In case of your refusal, I shall resort to other measures to\n     accomplish the same result. But, apart from the very serious\n     annoyances that such obstinacy on your part will cause you, it will\n     cost you twenty-five thousand francs for supplementary expenses.\n\n     \"Believe me, monsieur, I remain your devoted servant, ARS\u00c3\u0088NE\n     LUPIN.\"\n\nIn a fit of exasperation Mon. Gerbois committed the grave mistake of\nshowing that letter and allowing a copy of it to be taken. His\nindignation overcame his discretion.\n\n\"Nothing! He shall have nothing!\" he exclaimed, before a crowd of\nreporters. \"To divide my property with him? Never! Let him tear up the\nticket if he wishes!\"\n\n\"Yet five hundred thousand francs is better than nothing.\"\n\n\"That is not the question. It is a question of my just right, and that\nright I will establish before the courts.\"\n\n\"What! attack Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin? That would be amusing.\"\n\n\"No; but the Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Foncier. They must pay me the million francs.\"\n\n\"Without producing the ticket, or, at least, without proving that you\nbought it?\"\n\n\"That proof exists, since Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin admits that he stole the\nwriting-desk.\"\n\n\"But would the word of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin carry any weight with the court?\"\n\n\"No matter; I will fight it out.\"\n\nThe gallery shouted with glee; and wagers were freely made upon the\nresult with the odds in favor of Lupin. On the following Thursday the\npersonal column in the _Echo de France_ was eagerly perused by the\nexpectant public, but it contained nothing addressed to _M. Ars. Lup_.\nMon. Gerbois had not replied to Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin's letter. That was the\ndeclaration of war.\n\nThat evening the newspapers announced the abduction of Mlle. Suzanne\nGerbois.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe most entertaining feature in what might be called the Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin\ndramas is the comic attitude displayed by the Parisian police. Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne\nLupin talks, plans, writes, commands, threatens and executes as if the\npolice did not exist. They never figure in his calculations.\n\nAnd yet the police do their utmost. But what can they do against such a\nfoe--a foe that scorns and ignores them?\n\nSuzanne had left the house at twenty minutes to ten; such was the\ntestimony of the servant. On leaving the college, at five minutes past\nten, her father did not find her at the place she was accustomed to wait\nfor him. Consequently, whatever had happened must have occurred during\nthe course of Suzanne's walk from the house to the college. Two\nneighbors had met her about three hundred yards from the house. A lady\nhad seen, on the avenue, a young girl corresponding to Suzanne's\ndescription. No one else had seen her.\n\nInquiries were made in all directions; the employees of the railways and\nstreet-car lines were questioned, but none of them had seen anything of\nthe missing girl. However, at Ville-d'Avray, they found a shopkeeper who\nhad furnished gasoline to an automobile that had come from Paris on the\nday of the abduction. It was occupied by a blonde woman--extremely\nblonde, said the witness. An hour later, the automobile again passed\nthrough Ville-d'Avray on its way from Versailles to Paris. The\nshopkeeper declared that the automobile now contained a second woman\nwho was heavily veiled. No doubt, it was Suzanne Gerbois.\n\nThe abduction must have taken place in broad daylight, on a frequented\nstreet, in the very heart of the town. How? And at what spot? Not a cry\nwas heard; not a suspicious action had been seen. The shopkeeper\ndescribed the automobile as a royal-blue limousine of twenty-four\nhorse-power made by the firm of Peugeon & Co. Inquiries were then made\nat the Grand-Garage, managed by Madame Bob-Walthour, who made a\nspecialty of abductions by automobile. It was learned that she had\nrented a Peugeon limousine on that day to a blonde woman whom she had\nnever seen before nor since.\n\n\"Who was the chauffeur?\"\n\n\"A young man named Ernest, whom I had engaged only the day before. He\ncame well recommended.\"\n\n\"Is he here now?\"\n\n\"No. He brought back the machine, but I haven't seen him since,\" said\nMadame Bob-Walthour.\n\n\"Do you know where we can find him?\"\n\n\"You might see the people who recommended him to me. Here are the\nnames.\"\n\nUpon inquiry, it was learned that none of these people knew the man\ncalled Ernest. The recommendations were forged.\n\nSuch was the fate of every clue followed by the police. It ended\nnowhere. The mystery remained unsolved.\n\nMon. Gerbois had not the strength or courage to wage such an unequal\nbattle. The disappearance of his daughter crushed him; he capitulated\nto the enemy. A short announcement in the _Echo de France_ proclaimed\nhis unconditional surrender.\n\nTwo days later, Mon. Gerbois visited the office of the Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Foncier\nand handed lottery ticket number 514, series 23, to the governor, who\nexclaimed, with surprise:\n\n\"Ah! you have it! He has returned it to you!\"\n\n\"It was mislaid. That was all,\" replied Mon. Gerbois.\n\n\"But you pretended that it had been stolen.\"\n\n\"At first, I thought it had ... but here it is.\"\n\n\"We will require some evidence to establish your right to the ticket.\"\n\n\"Will the letter of the purchaser, Monsieur Bessy, be sufficient!\"\n\n\"Yes, that will do.\"\n\n\"Here it is,\" said Mon. Gerbois, producing the letter.\n\n\"Very well. Leave these papers with us. The rules of the lottery allow\nus fifteen days' time to investigate your claim. I will let you know\nwhen to call for your money. I presume you desire, as much as I do, that\nthis affair should be closed without further publicity.\"\n\n\"Quite so.\"\n\nMon. Gerbois and the governor henceforth maintained a discreet silence.\nBut the secret was revealed in some way, for it was soon commonly known\nthat Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin had returned the lottery ticket to Mon. Gerbois. The\npublic received the news with astonishment and admiration. Certainly, he\nwas a bold gamester who thus threw upon the table a trump card of such\nimportance as the precious ticket. But, it was true, he still retained a\ntrump card of equal importance. However, if the young girl should\nescape? If the hostage held by Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin should be rescued?\n\nThe police thought they had discovered the weak spot of the enemy, and\nnow redoubled their efforts. Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin disarmed by his own act,\ncrushed by the wheels of his own machination, deprived of every sou of\nthe coveted million ... public interest now centered in the camp of his\nadversary.\n\nBut it was necessary to find Suzanne. And they did not find her, nor did\nshe escape. Consequently, it must be admitted, Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin had won the\nfirst hand. But the game was not yet decided. The most difficult point\nremained. Mlle. Gerbois is in his possession, and he will hold her until\nhe receives five hundred thousand francs. But how and where will such an\nexchange be made? For that purpose, a meeting must be arranged, and then\nwhat will prevent Mon. Gerbois from warning the police and, in that way,\neffecting the rescue of his daughter and, at the same time, keeping his\nmoney? The professor was interviewed, but he was extremely reticent. His\nanswer was:\n\n\"I have nothing to say.\"\n\n\"And Mlle. Gerbois?\"\n\n\"The search is being continued.\"\n\n\"But Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin has written to you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do you swear to that?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then it is true. What are his instructions?\"\n\n\"I have nothing to say.\"\n\nThen the interviewers attacked Mon. Detinan, and found him equally\ndiscreet.\n\n\"Monsieur Lupin is my client, and I cannot discuss his affairs,\" he\nreplied, with an affected air of gravity.\n\nThese mysteries served to irritate the gallery. Obviously, some secret\nnegotiations were in progress. Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin had arranged and tightened\nthe meshes of his net, while the police maintained a close watch, day\nand night, over Mon. Gerbois. And the three and only possible\nd\u00c3\u00a9nouements--the arrest, the triumph, or the ridiculous and pitiful\nabortion--were freely discussed; but the curiosity of the public was\nonly partially satisfied, and it was reserved for these pages to reveal\nthe exact truth of the affair.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn Monday, March 12th, Mon. Gerbois received a notice from the Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit\nFoncier. On Wednesday, he took the one o'clock train for Paris. At two\no'clock, a thousand bank-notes of one thousand francs each were\ndelivered to him. Whilst he was counting them, one by one, in a state of\nnervous agitation--that money, which represented Suzanne's ransom--a\ncarriage containing two men stopped at the curb a short distance from\nthe bank. One of the men had grey hair and an unusually shrewd\nexpression which formed a striking contrast to his shabby make-up. It\nwas Detective Ganimard, the relentless enemy of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin. Ganimard\nsaid to his companion, Folenfant:\n\n\"In five minutes, we will see our clever friend Lupin. Is everything\nready?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How many men have we?\"\n\n\"Eight--two of them on bicycles.\"\n\n\"Enough, but not too many. On no account, must Gerbois escape us; if he\ndoes, it is all up. He will meet Lupin at the appointed place, give half\na million in exchange for the girl, and the game will be over.\"\n\n\"But why doesn't Gerbois work with us? That would be the better way, and\nhe could keep all the money himself.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he is afraid that if he deceives the other, he will not get\nhis daughter.\"\n\n\"What other?\"\n\n\"Lupin.\"\n\nGanimard pronounced the word in a solemn tone, somewhat timidly, as if\nhe were speaking of some supernatural creature whose claws he already\nfelt.\n\n\"It is very strange,\" remarked Folenfant, judiciously, \"that we are\nobliged to protect this gentleman contrary to his own wishes.\"\n\n\"Yes, but Lupin always turns the world upside down,\" said Ganimard,\nmournfully.\n\nA moment later, Mon. Gerbois appeared, and started up the street. At the\nend of the rue des Capucines, he turned into the boulevards, walking\nslowly, and stopping frequently to gaze at the shop-windows.\n\n\"Much too calm, too self-possessed,\" said Ganimard. \"A man with a\nmillion in his pocket would not have that air of tranquillity.\"\n\n\"What is he doing?\"\n\n\"Oh! nothing, evidently.... But I have a suspicion that it is\nLupin--yes, Lupin!\"\n\nAt that moment, Mon. Gerbois stopped at a news-stand, purchased a paper,\nunfolded it and commenced to read it as he walked slowly away. A moment\nlater, he gave a sudden bound into an automobile that was standing at\nthe curb. Apparently, the machine had been waiting for him, as it\nstarted away rapidly, turned at the Madeleine and disappeared.\n\n\"Nom de nom!\" cried Ganimard, \"that's one of his old tricks!\"\n\nGanimard hastened after the automobile around the Madeleine. Then, he\nburst into laughter. At the entrance to the Boulevard Malesherbes, the\nautomobile had stopped and Mon. Gerbois had alighted.\n\n\"Quick, Folenfant, the chauffeur! It may be the man Ernest.\"\n\nFolenfant interviewed the chauffeur. His name was Gaston; he was an\nemployee of the automobile cab company; ten minutes ago, a gentleman had\nengaged him and told him to wait near the news-stand for another\ngentleman.\n\n\"And the second man--what address did he give?\" asked Folenfant.\n\n\"No address. 'Boulevard Malesherbes ... avenue de Messine ... double\npourboire.' That is all.\"\n\nBut, during this time, Mon. Gerbois had leaped into the first passing\ncarriage.\n\n\"To the Concorde station, Metropolitan,\" he said to the driver.\n\nHe left the underground at the Place du Palais-Royal, ran to another\ncarriage and ordered it to go to the Place de la Bourse. Then a second\njourney by the underground to the Avenue de Villiers, followed by a\nthird carriage drive to number 25 rue Clapeyron.\n\nNumber 25 rue Clapeyron is separated from the Boulevard des Batignolles\nby the house which occupies the angle formed by the two streets. He\nascended to the first floor and rang. A gentleman opened the door.\n\n\"Does Monsieur Detinan live here?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is my name. Are you Monsieur Gerbois?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I was expecting you. Step in.\"\n\nAs Mon. Gerbois entered the lawyer's office, the clock struck three. He\nsaid:\n\n\"I am prompt to the minute. Is he here?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\nMon. Gerbois took a seat, wiped his forehead, looked at his watch as if\nhe did not know the time, and inquired, anxiously:\n\n\"Will he come?\"\n\n\"Well, monsieur,\" replied the lawyer, \"that I do not know, but I am\nquite as anxious and impatient as you are to find out. If he comes, he\nwill run a great risk, as this house has been closely watched for the\nlast two weeks. They distrust me.\"\n\n\"They suspect me, too. I am not sure whether the detectives lost sight\nof me or not on my way here.\"\n\n\"But you were--\"\n\n\"It wouldn't be my fault,\" cried the professor, quickly. \"You cannot\nreproach me. I promised to obey his orders, and I followed them to the\nvery letter. I drew the money at the time fixed by him, and I came here\nin the manner directed by him. I have faithfully performed my part of\nthe agreement--let him do his!\"\n\nAfter a short silence, he asked, anxiously:\n\n\"He will bring my daughter, won't he?\"\n\n\"I expect so.\"\n\n\"But ... you have seen him?\"\n\n\"I? No, not yet. He made the appointment by letter, saying both of you\nwould be here, and asking me to dismiss my servants before three o'clock\nand admit no one while you were here. If I would not consent to that\narrangement, I was to notify him by a few words in _the Echo de France_.\nBut I am only too happy to oblige Mon. Lupin, and so I consented.\"\n\n\"Ah! how will this end?\" moaned Mon. Gerbois.\n\nHe took the bank-notes from his pocket, placed them on the table and\ndivided them into two equal parts. Then the two men sat there in\nsilence. From time to time, Mon. Gerbois would listen. Did someone\nring?... His nervousness increased every minute, and Monsieur Detinan\nalso displayed considerable anxiety. At last, the lawyer lost his\npatience. He rose abruptly, and said:\n\n\"He will not come.... We shouldn't expect it. It would be folly on his\npart. He would run too great a risk.\"\n\nAnd Mon. Gerbois, despondent, his hands resting on the bank-notes,\nstammered:\n\n\"Oh! Mon Dieu! I hope he will come. I would give the whole of that money\nto see my daughter again.\"\n\nThe door opened.\n\n\"Half of it will be sufficient, Monsieur Gerbois.\"\n\nThese words were spoken by a well-dressed young man who now entered the\nroom and was immediately recognized by Mon. Gerbois as the person who\nhad wished to buy the desk from him at Versailles. He rushed toward him.\n\n\"Where is my daughter--my Suzanne?\"\n\nArs\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin carefully closed the door, and, while slowly removing his\ngloves, said to the lawyer:\n\n\"My dear ma\u00c3\u00aetre, I am indebted to you very much for your kindness in\nconsenting to defend my interests. I shall not forget it.\"\n\nMon. Detinan murmured:\n\n\"But you did not ring. I did not hear the door--\"\n\n\"Doors and bells are things that should work without being heard. I am\nhere, and that is the important point.\"\n\n\"My daughter! Suzanne! Where is she!\" repeated the professor.\n\n\"Mon Dieu, monsieur,\" said Lupin, \"what's your hurry? Your daughter will\nbe here in a moment.\"\n\nLupin walked to and fro for a minute, then, with the pompous air of an\norator, he said:\n\n\"Monsieur Gerbois, I congratulate you on the clever way in which you\nmade the journey to this place.\"\n\nThen, perceiving the two piles of bank-notes, he exclaimed:\n\n\"Ah! I see! the million is here. We will not lose any time. Permit me.\"\n\n\"One moment,\" said the lawyer, placing himself before the table. \"Mlle.\nGerbois has not yet arrived.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Is not her presence indispensable?\"\n\n\"I understand! I understand! Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin inspires only a limited\nconfidence. He might pocket the half-million and not restore the\nhostage. Ah! monsieur, people do not understand me. Because I have been\nobliged, by force of circumstances, to commit certain actions a little\n... out of the ordinary, my good faith is impugned ... I, who have\nalways observed the utmost scrupulosity and delicacy in business\naffairs. Besides, my dear monsieur if you have any fear, open the window\nand call. There are at least a dozen detectives in the street.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\nArs\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin raised the curtain.\n\n\"I think that Monsieur Gerbois could not throw Ganimard off the\nscent.... What did I tell you? There he is now.\"\n\n\"Is it possible!\" exclaimed the professor. \"But I swear to you--\"\n\n\"That you have not betrayed me?... I do not doubt you, but those fellows\nare clever--sometimes. Ah! I can see Folenfant, and Greaume, and\nDieuzy--all good friends of mine!\"\n\nMon. Detinan looked at Lupin in amazement. What assurance! He laughed as\nmerrily as if engaged in some childish sport, as if no danger threatened\nhim. This unconcern reassured the lawyer more than the presence of the\ndetectives. He left the table on which the bank-notes were lying. Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne\nLupin picked up one pile of bills after the other, took from each of\nthem twenty-five bank-notes which he offered to Mon. Detinan, saying:\n\n\"The reward of your services to Monsieur Gerbois and Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin. You\nwell deserve it.\"\n\n\"You owe me nothing,\" replied the lawyer.\n\n\"What! After all the trouble we have caused you!\"\n\n\"And all the pleasure you have given me!\"\n\n\"That means, my dear monsieur, that you do not wish to accept anything\nfrom Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin. See what it is to have a bad reputation.\"\n\nHe then offered the fifty thousand francs to Mon. Gerbois, saying:\n\n\"Monsieur, in memory of our pleasant interview, permit me to return you\nthis as a wedding-gift to Mlle. Gerbois.\"\n\nMon. Gerbois took the money, but said:\n\n\"My daughter will not marry.\"\n\n\"She will not marry if you refuse your consent; but she wishes to\nmarry.\"\n\n\"What do you know about it?\"\n\n\"I know that young girls often dream of such things unknown to their\nparents. Fortunately, there are sometimes good genii like Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin\nwho discover their little secrets in the drawers of their writing\ndesks.\"\n\n\"Did you find anything else?\" asked the lawyer. \"I confess I am curious\nto know why you took so much trouble to get possession of that desk.\"\n\n\"On account of its historic interest, my friend. Although despite the\nopinion of Monsieur Gerbois, the desk contained no treasure except the\nlottery ticket--and that was unknown to me--I had been seeking it for a\nlong time. That writing-desk of yew and mahogany was discovered in the\nlittle house in which Marie Wal\u00c3\u00aawska once lived in Boulogne, and, on one\nof the drawers there is this inscription: '_Dedicated to Napoleon I,\nEmperor of the French, by his very faithful servant, Mancion_.' And\nabove it, these words, engraved with the point of a knife: 'To you,\nMarie.' Afterwards, Napoleon had a similar desk made for the Empress\nJosephine; so that the secretary that was so much admired at the\nMalmaison was only an imperfect copy of the one that will henceforth\nform part of my collection.\"\n\n\"Ah! if I had known, when in the shop, I would gladly have given it up\nto you,\" said the professor.\n\nArs\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin smiled, as he replied:\n\n\"And you would have had the advantage of keeping for your own use\nlottery ticket number 514.\"\n\n\"And you would not have found it necessary to abduct my daughter.\"\n\n\"Abduct your daughter?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"My dear monsieur, you are mistaken. Mlle. Gerbois was not abducted.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. Abduction means force or violence. And I assure you that\nshe served as hostage of her own free will.\"\n\n\"Of her own free will!\" repeated Mon. Gerbois, in amazement.\n\n\"In fact, she almost asked to be taken. Why, do you suppose that an\nintelligent young girl like Mlle. Gerbois, and who, moreover, nourishes\nan unacknowledged passion, would hesitate to do what was necessary to\nsecure her dowry. Ah! I swear to you it was not difficult to make her\nunderstand that it was the only way to overcome your obstinacy.\"\n\nMon. Detinan was greatly amused. He replied to Lupin:\n\n\"But I should think it was more difficult to get her to listen to you.\nHow did you approach her?\"\n\n\"Oh! I didn't approach her myself. I have not the honor of her\nacquaintance. A friend of mine, a lady, carried on the negotiations.\"\n\n\"The blonde woman in the automobile, no doubt.\"\n\n\"Precisely. All arrangements were made at the first interview near the\ncollege. Since then, Mlle. Gerbois and her new friend have been\ntravelling in Belgium and Holland in a manner that should prove most\npleasing and instructive to a young girl. She will tell you all about it\nherself--\"\n\nThe bell of the vestibule door rang, three rings in quick succession,\nfollowed by two isolated rings.\n\n\"It is she,\" said Lupin. \"Monsieur Detinan, if you will be so kind--\"\n\nThe lawyer hastened to the door.\n\nTwo young women entered. One of them threw herself into the arms of Mon.\nGerbois. The other approached Lupin. The latter was a tall woman of a\ngood figure, very pale complexion, and with blond hair, parted over her\nforehead in undulating waves, that glistened and shone like the setting\nsun. She was dressed in black, with no display of jewelled ornaments;\nbut, on the contrary, her appearance indicated good taste and refined\nelegance. Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin spoke a few words to her; then, bowing to Mlle.\nGerbois, he said:\n\n\"I owe you an apology, mademoiselle, for all your troubles, but I hope\nyou have not been too unhappy--\"\n\n\"Unhappy! Why, I should have been very happy, indeed, if it hadn't been\nfor leaving my poor father.\"\n\n\"Then all is for the best. Kiss him again, and take advantage of the\nopportunity--it is an excellent one--to speak to him about your cousin.\"\n\n\"My cousin! What do you mean? I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Of course, you understand. Your cousin Philippe. The young man whose\nletters you kept so carefully.\"\n\nSuzanne blushed; but, following Lupin's advice, she again threw herself\ninto her father's arms. Lupin gazed upon them with a tender look.\n\n\"Ah! Such is my reward for a virtuous act! What a touching picture! A\nhappy father and a happy daughter! And to know that their joy is your\nwork, Lupin! Hereafter these people will bless you, and reverently\ntransmit your name unto their descendants, even unto the fourth\ngeneration. What a glorious reward, Lupin, for one act of kindness!\"\n\nHe walked to the window.\n\n\"Is dear old Ganimard still waiting?... He would like very much to be\npresent at this charming domestic scene!... Ah! he is not there.... Nor\nany of the others.... I don't see anyone. The deuce! The situation is\nbecoming serious. I dare say they are already under the porte-cochere\n... talking to the concierge, perhaps ... or, even, ascending the\nstairs!\"\n\nMon. Gerbois made a sudden movement. Now, that his daughter had been\nrestored to him, he saw the situation in a different light. To him, the\narrest of his adversary meant half-a-million francs. Instinctively, he\nmade a step forward. As if by chance, Lupin stood in his way.\n\n\"Where are you going, Monsieur Gerbois? To defend me against them! That\nis very kind of you, but I assure you it is not necessary. They are more\nworried than I.\"\n\nThen he continued to speak, with calm deliberation:\n\n\"But, really, what do they know? That you are here, and, perhaps, that\nMlle. Gerbois is here, for they may have seen her arrive with an unknown\nlady. But they do not imagine that I am here. How is it possible that I\ncould be in a house that they ran-sacked from cellar to garret this\nmorning? They suppose that the unknown lady was sent by me to make the\nexchange, and they will be ready to arrest her when she goes out--\"\n\nAt that moment, the bell rang. With a brusque movement, Lupin seized\nMon. Gerbois, and said to him, in an imperious tone:\n\n\"Do not move! Remember your daughter, and be prudent--otherwise--As to\nyou, Monsieur Detinan, I have your promise.\"\n\nMon. Gerbois was rooted to the spot. The lawyer did not stir. Without\nthe least sign of haste, Lupin picked up his hat and brushed the dust\nfrom off it with his sleeve.\n\n\"My dear Monsieur Detinan, if I can ever be of service to you.... My\nbest wishes, Mademoiselle Suzanne, and my kind regards to Monsieur\nPhilippe.\"\n\nHe drew a heavy gold watch from his pocket.\n\n\"Monsieur Gerbois, it is now forty-two minutes past three. At forty-six\nminutes past three, I give you permission to leave this room. Not one\nminute sooner than forty-six minutes past three.\"\n\n\"But they will force an entrance,\" suggested Mon. Detinan.\n\n\"You forget the law, my dear monsieur! Ganimard would never venture to\nviolate the privacy of a French citizen. But, pardon me, time flies, and\nyou are all slightly nervous.\"\n\nHe placed his watch on the table, opened the door of the room and\naddressing the blonde lady he said:\n\n\"Are you ready my dear?\"\n\nHe drew back to let her pass, bowed respectfully to Mlle. Gerbois, and\nwent out, closing the door behind him. Then they heard him in the\nvestibule, speaking, in a loud voice: \"Good-day, Ganimard, how goes it?\nRemember me to Madame Ganimard. One of these days, I shall invite her to\nbreakfast. Au revoir, Ganimard.\"\n\nThe bell rang violently, followed by repeated rings, and voices on the\nlanding.\n\n\"Forty-five minutes,\" muttered Mon. Gerbois.\n\nAfter a few seconds, he left the room and stepped into the vestibule.\nArs\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin and the blonde lady had gone.\n\n\"Papa!... you mustn't! Wait!\" cried Suzanne.\n\n\"Wait! you are foolish!... No quarter for that rascal!... And the\nhalf-million?\"\n\nHe opened the outer door. Ganimard rushed in.\n\n\"That woman--where is she? And Lupin?\"\n\n\"He was here ... he is here.\"\n\nGanimard uttered a cry of triumph.\n\n\"We have him. The house is surrounded.\"\n\n\"But the servant's stairway?\" suggested Mon. Detinan.\n\n\"It leads to the court,\" said Ganimard. \"There is only one exit--the\nstreet-door. Ten men are guarding it.\"\n\n\"But he didn't come in by the street-door, and he will not go out that\nway.\"\n\n\"What way, then?\" asked Ganimard. \"Through the air?\"\n\nHe drew aside a curtain and exposed a long corridor leading to the\nkitchen. Ganimard ran along it and tried the door of the servants'\nstairway. It was locked. From the window he called to one of his\nassistants:\n\n\"Seen anyone?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then they are still in the house!\" he exclaimed. \"They are hiding in\none of the rooms! They cannot have escaped. Ah! Lupin, you fooled me\nbefore, but, this time, I get my revenge.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt seven o'clock in the evening, Mon. Dudonis, chief of the detective\nservice, astonished at not receiving any news, visited the rue\nClapeyron. He questioned the detectives who were guarding the house,\nthen ascended to Mon. Detinan's apartment. The lawyer led him into his\nroom. There, Mon. Dudonis beheld a man, or rather two legs kicking in\nthe air, while the body to which they belonged was hidden in the depths\nof the chimney.\n\n\"Oh\u00c3\u00a9!... Oh\u00c3\u00a9!\" gasped a stifled voice. And a more distant voice, from on\nhigh, replied:\n\n\"Oh\u00c3\u00a9!... Oh\u00c3\u00a9!\"\n\nMon. Dudonis laughed, and exclaimed:\n\n\"Here! Ganimard, have you turned chimney-sweep?\"\n\nThe detective crawled out of the chimney. With his blackened face, his\nsooty clothes, and his feverish eyes, he was quite unrecognizable.\n\n\"I am looking for _him_,\" he growled.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin ... and his friend.\"\n\n\"Well, do you suppose they are hiding in the chimney?\"\n\nGanimard arose, laid his sooty hand on the sleeve of his superior\nofficer's coat, and exclaimed, angrily:\n\n\"Where do you think they are, chief? They must be somewhere! They are\nflesh and blood like you and me, and can't fade away like smoke.\"\n\n\"No, but they have faded away just the same.\"\n\n\"But how? How? The house is surrounded by our men--even on the roof.\"\n\n\"What about the adjoining house?\"\n\n\"There's no communication with it.\"\n\n\"And the apartments on the other floors?\"\n\n\"I know all the tenants. They have not seen anyone.\"\n\n\"Are you sure you know all of them?\"\n\n\"Yes. The concierge answers for them. Besides, as an extra precaution, I\nhave placed a man in each apartment. They can't escape. If I don't get\nthem to-night, I will get them to-morrow. I shall sleep here.\"\n\nHe slept there that night and the two following nights. Three days and\nnights passed away without the discovery of the irrepressible Lupin or\nhis female companion; more than that, Ganimard did not unearth the\nslightest clue on which to base a theory to explain their escape. For\nthat reason, he adhered to his first opinion.\n\n\"There is no trace of their escape; therefore, they are here.\"\n\nIt may be that, at the bottom of his heart, his conviction was less\nfirmly established, but he would not confess it. No, a thousand times,\nno! A man and a woman could not vanish like the evil spirits in a fairy\ntale. And, without losing his courage, he continued his searches, as if\nhe expected to find the fugitives concealed in some impenetrable\nretreat, or embodied in the stone walls of the house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE BLUE DIAMOND.\n\n\nOn the evening of March 27, at number 134 avenue Henri-Martin, in the\nhouse that he had inherited from his brother six months before, the old\ngeneral Baron d'Hautrec, ambassador at Berlin under the second Empire,\nwas asleep in a comfortable armchair, while his secretary was reading to\nhim, and the Sister Auguste was warming his bed and preparing the\nnight-lamp. At eleven o'clock, the Sister, who was obliged to return to\nthe convent of her order at that hour, said to the secretary:\n\n\"Mademoiselle Antoinette, my work is finished; I am going.\"\n\n\"Very well, Sister.\"\n\n\"Do not forget that the cook is away, and that you are alone in the\nhouse with the servant.\"\n\n\"Have no fear for the Baron. I sleep in the adjoining room and always\nleave the door open.\"\n\nThe Sister left the house. A few moments later, Charles, the servant,\ncame to receive his orders. The Baron was now awake, and spoke for\nhimself.\n\n\"The usual orders, Charles: see that the electric bell rings in your\nroom, and, at the first alarm, run for the doctor. Now, Mademoiselle\nAntoinette, how far did we get in our reading?\"\n\n\"Is Monsieur not going to bed now?\"\n\n\"No, no, I will go later. Besides, I don't need anyone.\"\n\nTwenty minutes later, he was sleeping again, and Antoinette crept away\non tiptoe. At that moment, Charles was closing the shutters on the lower\nfloor. In the kitchen, he bolted the door leading to the garden, and, in\nthe vestibule, he not only locked the door but hooked the chain as well.\nThen he ascended to his room on the third floor, went to bed, and was\nsoon asleep.\n\nProbably an hour had passed, when he leaped from his bed in alarm. The\nbell was ringing. It rang for some time, seven or eight seconds perhaps,\nwithout intermission.\n\n\"Well?\" muttered Charles, recovering his wits, \"another of the Baron's\nwhims.\"\n\nHe dressed himself quickly, descended the stairs, stopped in front of\nthe door, and rapped, according to his custom. He received no reply. He\nopened the door and entered.\n\n\"Ah! no light,\" he murmured. \"What is that for?\"\n\nThen, in a low voice, he called:\n\n\"Mademoiselle?\"\n\nNo reply.\n\n\"Are you there, mademoiselle? What's the matter? Is Monsieur le Baron\nill?\"\n\nNo reply. Nothing but a profound silence that soon became depressing. He\ntook two steps forward; his foot struck a chair, and, having touched it,\nhe noticed that it was overturned. Then, with his hand, he discovered\nother objects on the floor--a small table and a screen. Anxiously, he\napproached the wall, felt for the electric button, and turned on the\nlight.\n\nIn the centre of the room, between the table and dressing-case, lay the\nbody of his master, the Baron d'Hautrec.\n\n\"What!... It can't be possible!\" he stammered.\n\nHe could not move. He stood there, with bulging eyes, gazing stupidly at\nthe terrible disorder, the overturned chairs, a large crystal candelabra\nshattered in a thousand pieces, the clock lying on the marble\nhearthstone, all evidence of a fearful and desperate struggle. The\nhandle of a stiletto glittered, not far from the corpse; the blade was\nstained with blood. A handkerchief, marked with red spots, was lying on\nthe edge of the bed.\n\nCharles recoiled with horror: the body lying at his feet extended itself\nfor a moment, then shrunk up again; two or three tremors, and that was\nthe end.\n\nHe stooped over the body. There was a clean-cut wound on the neck from\nwhich the blood was flowing and then congealing in a black pool on the\ncarpet. The face retained an expression of extreme terror.\n\n\"Some one has killed him!\" he muttered, \"some one has killed him!\"\n\nThen he shuddered at the thought that there might be another dreadful\ncrime. Did not the baron's secretary sleep in the adjoining room! Had\nnot the assassin killed her also! He opened the door; the room was\nempty. He concluded that Antoinette had been abducted, or else she had\ngone away before the crime. He returned to the baron's chamber, his\nglance falling on the secretary, he noticed that that article of\nfurniture remained intact. Then, he saw upon a table, beside a bunch of\nkeys and a pocketbook that the baron placed there every night, a\nhandful of golden louis. Charles seized the pocketbook, opened it, and\nfound some bank-notes. He counted them; there were thirteen notes of one\nhundred francs each.\n\nInstinctively, mechanically, he put the bank-notes in his pocket, rushed\ndown the stairs, drew the bolt, unhooked the chain, closed the door\nbehind him, and fled to the street.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCharles was an honest man. He had scarcely left the gate, when, cooled\nby the night air and the rain, he came to a sudden halt. Now, he saw his\naction in its true light, and it filled him with horror. He hailed a\npassing cab, and said to the driver:\n\n\"Go to the police-office, and bring the commissary. Hurry! There has\nbeen a murder in that house.\"\n\nThe cab-driver whipped his horse. Charles wished to return to the house,\nbut found the gate locked. He had closed it himself when he came out,\nand it could not be opened from the outside. On the other hand, it was\nuseless to ring, as there was no one in the house.\n\nIt was almost an hour before the arrival of the police. When they came,\nCharles told his story and handed the bank-notes to the commissary. A\nlocksmith was summoned, and, after considerable difficulty, he succeeded\nin forcing open the garden gate and the vestibule door. The commissary\nof police entered the room first, but, immediately, turned to Charles\nand said:\n\n\"You told me that the room was in the greatest disorder.\"\n\nCharles stood at the door, amazed, bewildered; all the furniture had\nbeen restored to its accustomed place. The small table was standing\nbetween the two windows, the chairs were upright, and the clock was on\nthe centre of the mantel. The debris of the candelabra had been removed.\n\n\"Where is.... Monsieur le Baron?\" stammered Charles.\n\n\"That's so!\" exclaimed the officer, \"where is the victim?\"\n\nHe approached the bed, and drew aside a large sheet, under which reposed\nthe Baron d'Hautrec, formerly French Ambassador at Berlin. Over him, lay\nhis military coat, adorned with the Cross of Honor. His features were\ncalm. His eyes were closed.\n\n\"Some one has been here,\" said Charles.\n\n\"How did they get in?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but some one has been here during my absence. There was a\nstiletto on the floor--there! And a handkerchief, stained with blood, on\nthe bed. They are not here now. They have been carried away. And some\none has put the room in order.\"\n\n\"Who would do that?\"\n\n\"The assassin.\"\n\n\"But we found all the doors locked.\"\n\n\"He must have remained in the house.\"\n\n\"Then he must be here yet, as you were in front of the house all the\ntime.\"\n\nCharles reflected a moment, then said, slowly:\n\n\"Yes ... of course.... I didn't go away from the gate.\"\n\n\"Who was the last person you saw with the baron?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle Antoinette, his secretary.\"\n\n\"What has become of her?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Her bed wasn't occupied, so she must have gone out. I am\nnot surprised at that, as she is young and pretty.\"\n\n\"But how could she leave the house?\"\n\n\"By the door,\" said Charles.\n\n\"But you had bolted and chained it.\"\n\n\"Yes, but she must have left before that.\"\n\n\"And the crime was committed after her departure?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said the servant.\n\nThe house was searched from cellar to garret, but the assassin had fled.\nHow? And when? Was it he or an accomplice who had returned to the scene\nof the crime and removed everything that might furnish a clue to his\nidentity? Such were the questions the police were called upon to solve.\n\nThe coroner came at seven o'clock; and, at eight o'clock, Mon. Dudouis,\nthe head of the detective service, arrived on the scene. They were\nfollowed by the Procureur of the Republic and the investigating\nmagistrate. In addition to these officials, the house was overrun with\npolicemen, detectives, newspaper reporters, photographers, and relatives\nand acquaintances of the murdered man.\n\nA thorough search was made; they studied out the position of the corpse\naccording to the information furnished by Charles; they questioned\nSister Auguste when she arrived; but they discovered nothing new. Sister\nAuguste was astonished to learn of the disappearance of Antoinette\nBr\u00c3\u00a9hat. She had engaged the young girl twelve days before, on excellent\nrecommendations, and refused to believe that she would neglect her duty\nby leaving the house during the night.\n\n\"But, you see, she hasn't returned yet,\" said the magistrate, \"and we\nare still confronted with the question: What has become of her?\"\n\n\"I think she was abducted by the assassin,\" said Charles.\n\nThe theory was plausible, and was borne out by certain facts. Mon.\nDudouis agreed with it. He said:\n\n\"Abducted? ma foi! that is not improbable.\"\n\n\"Not only improbable,\" said a voice, \"but absolutely opposed to the\nfacts. There is not a particle of evidence to support such a theory.\"\n\nThe voice was harsh, the accent sharp, and no one was surprised to learn\nthat the speaker was Ganimard. In no one else, would they tolerate such\na domineering tone.\n\n\"Ah! it is you, Ganimard!\" exclaimed Mon. Dudouis. \"I had not seen you\nbefore.\"\n\n\"I have been here since two o'clock.\"\n\n\"So you are interested in some things outside of lottery ticket number\n514, the affair of the rue Clapeyron, the blonde lady and Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne\nLupin?\"\n\n\"Ha-ha!\" laughed the veteran detective. \"I would not say that Lupin is a\nstranger to the present case. But let us forget the affair of the\nlottery ticket for a few moments, and try to unravel this new mystery.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGanimard is not one of those celebrated detectives whose methods will\ncreate a school, or whose name will be immortalized in the criminal\nannals of his country. He is devoid of those flashes of genius which\ncharacterize the work of Dupin, Lecoq and Sherlock Holmes. Yet, it must\nbe admitted, he possesses superior qualities of observation, sagacity,\nperseverance and even intuition. His merit lies in his absolute\nindependence. Nothing troubles or influences him, except, perhaps, a\nsort of fascination that Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin holds over him. However that may\nbe, there is no doubt that his position on that morning, in the house of\nthe late Baron d'Hautrec, was one of undoubted superiority, and his\ncollaboration in the case was appreciated and desired by the\ninvestigating magistrate.\n\n\"In the first place,\" said Ganimard, \"I will ask Monsieur Charles to be\nvery particular on one point: He says that, on the occasion of his\nfirst visit to the room, various articles of furniture were overturned\nand strewn about the place; now, I ask him whether, on his second visit\nto the room, he found all those articles restored to their accustomed\nplaces--I mean, of course, correctly placed.\"\n\n\"Yes, all in their proper places,\" replied Charles.\n\n\"It is obvious, then, that the person who replaced them must have been\nfamiliar with the location of those articles.\"\n\nThe logic of this remark was apparent to his hearers. Ganimard\ncontinued:\n\n\"One more question, Monsieur Charles. You were awakened by the ringing\nof your bell. Now, who, do you think, rang it?\"\n\n\"Monsieur le baron, of course.\"\n\n\"When could he ring it?\"\n\n\"After the struggle ... when he was dying.\"\n\n\"Impossible; because you found him lying, unconscious, at a point more\nthan four metres from the bell-button.\"\n\n\"Then he must have rung during the struggle.\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" declared Ganimard, \"since the ringing, as you have said,\nwas continuous and uninterrupted, and lasted seven or eight seconds. Do\nyou think his antagonist would have permitted him to ring the bell in\nthat leisurely manner?\"\n\n\"Well, then, it was before the attack.\"\n\n\"Also, quite impossible, since you have told us that the lapse of time\nbetween the ringing of the bell and your entrance to the room was not\nmore than three minutes. Therefore, if the baron rang before the attack,\nwe are forced to the conclusion that the struggle, the murder and the\nflight of the assassin, all occurred within the short space of three\nminutes. I repeat: that is impossible.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said the magistrate, \"some one rang. If it were not the\nbaron, who was it?\"\n\n\"The murderer.\"\n\n\"For what purpose?\"\n\n\"I do not know. But the fact that he did ring proves that he knew that\nthe bell communicated with the servant's room. Now, who would know that,\nexcept an inmate of the house?\"\n\nGanimard was drawing the meshes of his net closer and tighter. In a few\nclear and logical sentences, he had unfolded and defined his theory of\nthe crime, so that it seemed quite natural when the magistrate said:\n\n\"As I understand it, Ganimard, you suspect the girl Antoinette Br\u00c3\u00a9hat?\"\n\n\"I do not suspect her; I accuse her.\"\n\n\"You accuse her of being an accomplice?\"\n\n\"I accuse her of having killed Baron d'Hautrec.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! What proof have you?\"\n\n\"The handful of hair I found in the right hand of the victim.\"\n\nHe produced the hair; it was of a beautiful blond color, and glittered\nlike threads of gold. Charles looked at it, and said:\n\n\"That is Mademoiselle Antoinette's hair. There can be no doubt of it.\nAnd, then, there is another thing. I believe that the knife, which I saw\non my first visit to the room, belonged to her. She used it to cut the\nleaves of books.\"\n\nA long, dreadful silence followed, as if the crime had acquired an\nadditional horror by reason of having been committed by a woman. At\nlast, the magistrate said:\n\n\"Let us assume, until we are better informed, that the baron was killed\nby Antoinette Br\u00c3\u00a9hat. We have yet to learn where she concealed herself\nafter the crime, how she managed to return after Charles left the house,\nand how she made her escape after the arrival of the police. Have you\nformed any opinion on those points Ganimard?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"Well, then, where do we stand?\"\n\nGanimard was embarrassed. Finally, with a visible effort, he said:\n\n\"All I can say is that I find in this case the same method of procedure\nas we found in the affair of the lottery ticket number 514; the same\nphenomena, which might be termed the faculty of disappearing. Antoinette\nBr\u00c3\u00a9hat has appeared and disappeared in this house as mysteriously as\nArs\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin entered the house of Monsieur Detinan and escaped therefrom\nin the company of the blonde lady.\n\n\"Does that signify anything?\"\n\n\"It does to me. I can see a probable connection between those two\nstrange incidents. Antoinette Br\u00c3\u00a9hat was hired by Sister Auguste twelve\ndays ago, that is to say, on the day after the blonde Lady so cleverly\nslipped through my fingers. In the second place, the hair of the blonde\nLady was exactly of the same brilliant golden hue as the hair found in\nthis case.\"\n\n\"So that, in your opinion, Antoinette Br\u00c3\u00a9hat--\"\n\n\"Is the blonde Lady--precisely.\"\n\n\"And that Lupin had a hand in both cases?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is my opinion.\"\n\nThis statement was greeted with an outburst of laughter. It came from\nMon. Dudouis.\n\n\"Lupin! always Lupin! Lupin is into everything; Lupin is everywhere!\"\n\n\"Yes, Lupin is into everything of any consequence,\" replied Ganimard,\nvexed at the ridicule of his superior.\n\n\"Well, so far as I see,\" observed Mon. Dudouis, \"you have not discovered\nany motive for this crime. The secretary was not broken into, nor the\npocketbook carried away. Even, a pile of gold was left upon the table.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is so,\" exclaimed Ganimard, \"but the famous diamond?\"\n\n\"What diamond?\"\n\n\"The blue diamond! The celebrated diamond which formed part of the royal\ncrown of France, and which was given by the Duke d'Aumale to Leonide\nLebrun, and, at the death of Leonide Lebrun, was purchased by the Baron\nd'Hautrec as a souvenir of the charming comedienne that he had loved so\nwell. That is one of those things that an old Parisian, like I, does not\nforget.\"\n\n\"It is obvious that if the blue diamond is not found, the motive for the\ncrime is disclosed,\" said the magistrate. \"But where should we search\nfor it?\"\n\n\"On the baron's finger,\" replied Charles. \"He always wore the blue\ndiamond on his left hand.\"\n\n\"I saw that hand, and there was only a plain gold ring on it,\" said\nGanimard, as he approached the corpse.\n\n\"Look in the palm of the hand,\" replied the servant.\n\nGanimard opened the stiffened hand. The bezel was turned inward, and, in\nthe centre of that bezel, the blue diamond shone with all its glorious\nsplendor.\n\n\"The deuce!\" muttered Ganimard, absolutely amazed, \"I don't understand\nit.\"\n\n\"You will now apologize to Lupin for having suspected him, eh?\" said\nMon. Dudouis, laughing.\n\nGanimard paused for a moment's reflection, and then replied,\nsententiously:\n\n\"It is only when I do not understand things that I suspect Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne\nLupin.\"\n\nSuch were the facts established by the police on the day after the\ncommission of that mysterious crime. Facts that were vague and\nincoherent in themselves, and which were not explained by any subsequent\ndiscoveries. The movements of Antoinette Br\u00c3\u00a9hat remained as inexplicable\nas those of the blonde Lady, and the police discovered no trace of that\nmysterious creature with the golden hair who had killed Baron d'Hautrec\nand had failed to take from his finger the famous diamond that had once\nshone in the royal crown of France.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe heirs of the Baron d'Hautrec could not fail to benefit by such\nnotoriety. They established in the house an exhibition of the furniture\nand other objects which were to be sold at the auction rooms of Drouot &\nCo. Modern furniture of indifferent taste, various objects of no\nartistic value ... but, in the centre of the room, in a case of purple\nvelvet, protected by a glass globe, and guarded by two officers, was the\nfamous blue diamond ring.\n\nA large magnificent diamond of incomparable purity, and of that\nindefinite blue which the clear water receives from an unclouded sky, of\nthat blue which can be detected in the whiteness of linen. Some admired,\nsome enthused ... and some looked with horror on the chamber of the\nvictim, on the spot where the corpse had lain, on the floor divested of\nits blood-stained carpet, and especially the walls, the unsurmountable\nwalls over which the criminal must have passed. Some assured themselves\nthat the marble mantel did not move, others imagined gaping holes,\nmouths of tunnels, secret connections with the sewers, and the\ncatacombs--\n\nThe sale of the blue diamond took place at the salesroom of Drouot & Co.\nThe place was crowded to suffocation, and the bidding was carried to the\nverge of folly. The sale was attended by all those who usually appear at\nsimilar events in Paris; those who buy, and those who make a pretense of\nbeing able to buy; bankers, brokers, artists, women of all classes, two\ncabinet ministers, an Italian tenor, an exiled king who, in order to\nmaintain his credit, bid, with much ostentation, and in a loud voice, as\nhigh as one hundred thousand francs. One hundred thousand francs! He\ncould offer that sum without any danger of his bid being accepted. The\nItalian tenor risked one hundred and fifty thousand, and a member of the\nCom\u00c3\u00a9die-Fran\u00c3\u00a7aise bid one hundred and seventy-five thousand francs.\n\nWhen the bidding reached two hundred thousand francs, the smaller\ncompetitors fell out of the race. At two hundred and fifty thousand,\nonly two bidders remained in the field: Herschmann, the well-known\ncapitalist, the king of gold mines; and the Countess de Crozon, the\nwealthy American, whose collection of diamonds and precious stones is\nfamed throughout the world.\n\n\"Two hundred and sixty thousand ... two hundred and seventy thousand ...\nseventy-five ... eighty....\" exclaimed the auctioneer, as he glanced at\nthe two competitors in succession. \"Two hundred and eighty thousand for\nmadame.... Do I hear any more?\"\n\n\"Three hundred thousand,\" said Herschmann.\n\nThere was a short silence. The countess was standing, smiling, but pale\nfrom excitement. She was leaning against the back of the chair in front\nof her. She knew, and so did everyone present, that the issue of the\nduel was certain; logically, inevitably, it must terminate to the\nadvantage of the capitalist, who had untold millions with which to\nindulge his caprices. However, the countess made another bid:\n\n\"Three hundred and five thousand.\"\n\nAnother silence. All eyes were now directed to the capitalist in the\nexpectation that he would raise the bidding. But Herschmann was not\npaying any attention to the sale; his eyes were fixed on a sheet of\npaper which he held in his right hand, while the other hand held a torn\nenvelope.\n\n\"Three hundred and five thousand,\" repeated the auctioneer. \"Once!...\nTwice!... For the last time.... Do I hear any more?... Once!...\nTwice!... Am I offered any more? Last chance!...\"\n\nHerschmann did not move.\n\n\"Third and last time!... Sold!\" exclaimed the auctioneer, as his hammer\nfell.\n\n\"Four hundred thousand,\" cried Herschman, starting up, as if the sound\nof the hammer had roused him from his stupor.\n\nToo late; the auctioneer's decision was irrevocable. Some of\nHerschmann's acquaintances pressed around him. What was the matter? Why\ndid he not speak sooner? He laughed, and said:\n\n\"Ma foi! I simply forgot--in a moment of abstraction.\"\n\n\"That is strange.\"\n\n\"You see, I just received a letter.\"\n\n\"And that letter was sufficient--\"\n\n\"To distract my attention? Yes, for a moment.\"\n\nGanimard was there. He had come to witness the sale of the ring. He\nstopped one of the attendants of the auction room, and said:\n\n\"Was it you who carried the letter to Monsieur Herschmann?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Who gave it to you?\"\n\n\"A lady.\"\n\n\"Where is she?\"\n\n\"Where is she?... She was sitting down there ... the lady who wore a\nthick veil.\"\n\n\"She has gone?\"\n\n\"Yes, just this moment.\"\n\nGanimard hastened to the door, and saw the lady descending the stairs.\nHe ran after her. A crush of people delayed him at the entrance. When\nhe reached the sidewalk, she had disappeared. He returned to the auction\nroom, accosted Herschmann, introduced himself, and enquired about the\nletter. Herschmann handed it to him. It was carelessly scribbled in\npencil, in a handwriting unknown to the capitalist, and contained these\nfew words:\n\n_\"The blue diamond brings misfortune. Remember the Baron d'Hautrec.\"_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe vicissitudes of the blue diamond were not yet at an end. Although it\nhad become well-known through the murder of the Baron d'Hautrec and the\nincidents at the auction-rooms, it was six months later that it attained\neven greater celebrity. During the following summer, the Countess de\nCrozon was robbed of the famous jewel she had taken so much trouble to\nacquire.\n\nLet me recall that strange affair, of which the exciting and dramatic\nincidents sent a thrill through all of us, and over which I am now\npermitted to throw some light.\n\nOn the evening of August 10, the guests of the Count and Countess de\nCrozon were assembled in the drawing-room of the magnificent ch\u00c3\u00a2teau\nwhich overlooks the Bay de Somme. To entertain her friends, the countess\nseated herself at the piano to play for them, after first placing her\njewels on a small table near the piano, and, amongst them, was the ring\nof the Baron d'Hautrec.\n\nAn hour later, the count and the majority of the guests retired,\nincluding his two cousins and Madame de R\u00c3\u00a9al, an intimate friend of the\ncountess. The latter remained in the drawing-room with Herr Bleichen,\nthe Austrian consul, and his wife.\n\nThey conversed for a time, and then the countess extinguished the large\nlamp that stood on a table in the centre of the room. At the same\nmoment, Herr Bleichen extinguished the two piano lamps. There was a\nmomentary darkness; then the consul lighted a candle, and the three of\nthem retired to their rooms. But, as soon as she reached her apartment,\nthe countess remembered her jewels and sent her maid to get them. When\nthe maid returned with the jewels, she placed them on the mantel without\nthe countess looking at them. Next day, Madame de Crozon found that one\nof her rings was missing; it was the blue diamond ring.\n\nShe informed her husband, and, after talking it over, they reached the\nconclusion that the maid was above suspicion, and that the guilty party\nmust be Herr Bleichen.\n\nThe count notified the commissary of police at Amiens, who commenced an\ninvestigation and, discreetly, exercised a strict surveillance over the\nAustrian consul to prevent his disposing of the ring.\n\nThe ch\u00c3\u00a2teau was surrounded by detectives day and night. Two weeks passed\nwithout incident. Then Herr Bleichen announced his intended departure.\nThat day, a formal complaint was entered against him. The police made an\nofficial examination of his luggage. In a small satchel, the key to\nwhich was always carried by the consul himself, they found a bottle of\ndentifrice, and in that bottle they found the ring.\n\nMadame Bleichen fainted. Her husband was placed under arrest.\n\nEveryone will remember the line of defense adopted by the accused man.\nHe declared that the ring must have been placed there by the Count de\nCrozen as an act of revenge. He said:\n\n\"The count is brutal and makes his wife very unhappy. She consulted me,\nand I advised her to get a divorce. The count heard of it in some way,\nand, to be revenged on me, he took the ring and placed it in my\nsatchel.\"\n\nThe count and countess persisted in pressing the charge. Between the\nexplanation which they gave and that of the consul, both equally\npossible and equally probable, the public had to choose. No new fact was\ndiscovered to turn the scale in either direction. A month of gossip,\nconjectures and investigations failed to produce a single ray of light.\n\nWearied of the excitement and notoriety, and incapable of securing the\nevidence necessary to sustain their charge against the consul, the count\nand countess at last sent to Paris for a detective competent to unravel\nthe tangled threads of this mysterious skein. This brought Ganimard into\nthe case.\n\nFor four days, the veteran detective searched the house from top to\nbottom, examined every foot of the ground, had long conferences with the\nmaid, the chauffeur, the gardeners, the employees in the neighboring\npost-offices, visited the rooms that had been occupied by the various\nguests. Then, one morning, he disappeared without taking leave of his\nhost or hostess. But a week later, they received this telegram:\n\n\"Please come to the Japanese Tea-room, rue Boissy d'Anglas, to-morrow,\nFriday, evening at five o'clock. Ganimard.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt five o'clock, Friday evening, their automobile stopped in front of\nnumber nine rue Boissy-d'Anglas. The old detective was standing on the\nsidewalk, waiting for them. Without a word, he conducted them to the\nfirst floor of the Japanese Tea-room. In one of the rooms, they met two\nmen, whom Ganimard introduced in these words:\n\n\"Monsieur Gerbois, professor in the College of Versailles, from whom,\nyou will remember, Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin stole half a million; Monsieur L\u00c3\u00a9once\nd'Hautrec, nephew and sole legatee of the Baron d'Hautrec.\"\n\nA few minutes later, another man arrived. It was Mon. Dudouis, head of\nthe detective service, and he appeared to be in a particularly bad\ntemper. He bowed, and then said:\n\n\"What's the trouble now, Ganimard? I received your telephone message\nasking me to come here. Is it anything of consequence?\"\n\n\"Yes, chief, it is a very important matter. Within an hour, the last two\ncases to which I was assigned will have their d\u00c3\u00a9nouement here. It\nseemed to me that your presence was indispensable.\"\n\n\"And also the presence of Dieuzy and Folenfant, whom I noticed standing\nnear the door as I came in?\"\n\n\"Yes, chief.\"\n\n\"For what? Are you going to make an arrest, and you wish to do it with a\nflourish? Come, Ganimard, I am anxious to hear about it.\"\n\nGanimard hesitated a moment, then spoke with the obvious intention of\nmaking an impression on his hearers:\n\n\"In the first place, I wish to state that Herr Bleichen had nothing to\ndo with the theft of the ring.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" exclaimed Mon. Dudouis, \"that is a bold statement and a very\nserious one.\"\n\n\"And is that all you have discovered?\" asked the Count de Crozon.\n\n\"Not at all. On the second day after the theft, three of your guests\nwent on an automobile trip as far as Cr\u00c3\u00a9cy. Two of them visited the\nfamous battlefield; and, while they were there, the third party paid a\nhasty visit to the post-office, and mailed a small box, tied and sealed\naccording to the regulations, and declared its value to be one hundred\nfrancs.\"\n\n\"I see nothing strange in that,\" said the count.\n\n\"Perhaps you will see something strange in it when I tell you that this\nperson, in place of giving her true name, sent the box under the name of\nRousseau, and the person to whom it was addressed, a certain Monsieur\nBeloux of Paris, moved his place of residence immediately after\nreceiving the box, in other words, the ring.\"\n\n\"I presume you refer to one of my cousins d'Andelle?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Ganimard.\n\n\"Madame de R\u00c3\u00a9al, then?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You accuse my friend, Madam de R\u00c3\u00a9al?\" cried the countess, shocked and\namazed.\n\n\"I wish to ask you one question, madame,\" said Ganimard. \"Was Madam de\nR\u00c3\u00a9al present when you purchased the ring?\"\n\n\"Yes, but we did not go there together.\"\n\n\"Did she advise you to buy the ring?\"\n\nThe countess considered for a moment, then said:\n\n\"Yes, I think she mentioned it first--\"\n\n\"Thank you, madame. Your answer establishes the fact that it was Madame\nde R\u00c3\u00a9al who was the first to mention the ring, and it was she who\nadvised you to buy it.\"\n\n\"But, I consider my friend is quite incapable--\"\n\n\"Pardon me, countess, when I remind you that Madame de R\u00c3\u00a9al is only a\ncasual acquaintance and not your intimate friend, as the newspapers have\nannounced. It was only last winter that you met her for the first time.\nNow, I can prove that everything she has told you about herself, her\npast life, and her relatives, is absolutely false; that Madame Blanche\nde R\u00c3\u00a9al had no actual existence before she met you, and she has now\nceased to exist.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well?\" replied Ganimard.\n\n\"Your story is a very strange one,\" said the countess, \"but it has no\napplication to our case. If Madame de R\u00c3\u00a9al had taken the ring, how do\nyou explain the fact that it was found in Herr Bleichen's tooth-powder?\nAnyone who would take the risk and trouble of stealing the blue diamond\nwould certainly keep it. What do you say to that?\"\n\n\"I--nothing--but Madame de R\u00c3\u00a9al will answer it.\"\n\n\"Oh! she does exist, then?\"\n\n\"She does--and does not. I will explain in a few words. Three days ago,\nwhile reading a newspaper, I glanced over the list of hotel arrivals at\nTrouville, and there I read: 'H\u00c3\u00b4tel Beaurivage--Madame de R\u00c3\u00a9al, etc.'\n\n\"I went to Trouville immediately, and interviewed the proprietor of the\nhotel. From the description and other information I received from him, I\nconcluded that she was the very Madame de R\u00c3\u00a9al that I was seeking; but\nshe had left the hotel, giving her address in Paris as number three rue\nde Colis\u00c3\u00a9e. The day before yesterday I went to that address, and learned\nthat there was no person there called Madame de R\u00c3\u00a9al, but there was a\nMadame R\u00c3\u00a9al, living on the second floor, who acted as a diamond broker\nand was frequently away from home. She had returned from a journey on\nthe preceding evening. Yesterday, I called on her and, under an assumed\nname, I offered to act as an intermedium in the sale of some diamonds to\ncertain wealthy friends of mine. She is to meet me here to-day to carry\nout that arrangement.\"\n\n\"What! You expect her to come here?\"\n\n\"Yes, at half-past five.\"\n\n\"Are you sure it is she?\"\n\n\"Madame de R\u00c3\u00a9al of the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau de Crozon? Certainly. I have convincing\nevidence of that fact. But ... listen!... I hear Folenfant's signal.\"\n\nIt was a whistle. Ganimard arose quickly.\n\n\"There is no time to lose. Monsieur and Madame de Crozon, will you be\nkind enough to go into the next room. You also, Monsieur d'Hautrec, and\nyou, Monsieur Gerbois. The door will remain open, and when I give the\nsignal, you will come out. Of course, Chief, you will remain here.\"\n\n\"We may be disturbed by other people,\" said Mon. Dudouis.\n\n\"No. This is a new establishment, and the proprietor is one of my\nfriends. He will not let anyone disturb us--except the blonde Lady.\"\n\n\"The blonde Lady! What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, the blonde Lady herself, chief; the friend and accomplice of\nArs\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin, the mysterious blonde Lady against whom I hold convincing\nevidence; but, in addition to that, I wish to confront her with all the\npeople she has robbed.\"\n\nHe looked through the window.\n\n\"I see her. She is coming in the door now. She can't escape: Folenfant\nand Dieuzy are guarding the door.... The blonde Lady is captured at\nlast, Chief!\"\n\nA moment later a woman appeared at the door; she was tall and slender,\nwith a very pale complexion and bright golden hair. Ganimard trembled\nwith excitement; he could not move, nor utter a word. She was there, in\nfront of him, at his mercy! What a victory over Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin! And what a\nrevenge! And, at the same time, the victory was such an easy one that he\nasked himself if the blonde Lady would not yet slip through his fingers\nby one of those miracles that usually terminated the exploits of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne\nLupin. She remained standing near the door, surprised at the silence,\nand looked about her without any display of suspicion or fear.\n\n\"She will get away! She will disappear!\" thought Ganimard.\n\nThen he managed to get between her and the door. She turned to go out.\n\n\"No, no!\" he said. \"Why are you going away?\"\n\n\"Really, monsieur, I do not understand what this means. Allow me--\"\n\n\"There is no reason why you should go, madame, and very good reasons\nwhy you should remain.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"It is useless, madame. You cannot go.\"\n\nTrembling, she sat on a chair, and stammered:\n\n\"What is it you want?\"\n\nGanimard had won the battle and captured the blonde Lady. He said to\nher:\n\n\"Allow me to present the friend I mentioned, who desires to purchase\nsome diamonds. Have you procured the stones you promised to bring?\"\n\n\"No--no--I don't know. I don't remember.\"\n\n\"Come! Jog your memory! A person of your acquaintance intended to send\nyou a tinted stone.... 'Something like the blue diamond,' I said,\nlaughing; and you replied: 'Exactly, I expect to have just what you\nwant.' Do you remember?\"\n\nShe made no reply. A small satchel fell from her hand. She picked it up\nquickly, and held it securely. Her hands trembled slightly.\n\n\"Come!\" said Ganimard, \"I see you have no confidence in us, Madame de\nR\u00c3\u00a9al. I shall set you a good example by showing you what I have.\"\n\nHe took from his pocketbook a paper which he unfolded, and disclosed a\nlock of hair.\n\n\"These are a few hairs torn from the head of Antoinette Br\u00c3\u00a9hat by the\nBaron d'Hautrec, which I found clasped in his dead hand. I have shown\nthem to Mlle. Gerbois, who declares they are of the exact color of the\nhair of the blonde Lady. Besides, they are exactly the color of your\nhair--the identical color.\"\n\nMadame R\u00c3\u00a9al looked at him in bewilderment, as if she did not understand\nhis meaning. He continued:\n\n\"And here are two perfume bottles, without labels, it is true, and\nempty, but still sufficiently impregnated with their odor to enable\nMlle. Gerbois to recognize in them the perfume used by that blonde Lady\nwho was her traveling companion for two weeks. Now, one of these bottles\nwas found in the room that Madame de R\u00c3\u00a9al occupied at the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau de\nCrozon, and the other in the room that you occupied at the H\u00c3\u00b4tel\nBeaurivage.\"\n\n\"What do you say?... The blonde Lady ... the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau de Crozon....\"\n\nThe detective did not reply. He took from his pocket and placed on the\ntable, side by side, four small sheets of paper. Then he said:\n\n\"I have, on these four pieces of paper, various specimens of\nhandwriting; the first is the writing of Antoinette Br\u00c3\u00a9hat; the second\nwas written by the woman who sent the note to Baron Herschmann at the\nauction sale of the blue diamond; the third is that of Madame de R\u00c3\u00a9al,\nwritten while she was stopping at the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau de Crozon; and the fourth\nis your handwriting, madame ... it is your name and address, which you\ngave to the porter of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel Beaurivage at Trouville. Now, compare\nthe four handwritings. They are identical.\"\n\n\"What absurdity is this? really, monsieur, I do not understand. What\ndoes it mean?\"\n\n\"It means, madame,\" exclaimed Ganimard, \"that the blonde Lady, the\nfriend and accomplice of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin, is none other than you, Madame\nR\u00c3\u00a9al.\"\n\nGanimard went to the adjoining room and returned with Mon. Gerbois, whom\nhe placed in front of Madame R\u00c3\u00a9al, as he said:\n\n\"Monsieur Gerbois, is this the person who abducted your daughter, the\nwoman you saw at the house of Monsieur Detinan?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nGanimard was so surprised that he could not speak for a moment; finally,\nhe said: \"No?... You must be mistaken....\"\n\n\"I am not mistaken. Madame is blonde, it is true, and in that respect\nresembles the blonde Lady; but, in all other respects, she is totally\ndifferent.\"\n\n\"I can't believe it. You must be mistaken.\"\n\nGanimard called in his other witnesses.\n\n\"Monsieur d'Hautrec,\" he said, \"do you recognize Antoinette Br\u00c3\u00a9hat?\"\n\n\"No, this is not the person I saw at my uncle's house.\"\n\n\"This woman is not Madame de R\u00c3\u00a9al,\" declared the Count de Crozon.\n\nThat was the finishing touch. Ganimard was crushed. He was buried\nbeneath the ruins of the structure he had erected with so much care and\nassurance. His pride was humbled, his spirit was broken, by the force of\nthis unexpected blow.\n\nMon. Dudouis arose, and said:\n\n\"We owe you an apology, madame, for this unfortunate mistake. But, since\nyour arrival here, I have noticed your nervous agitation. Something\ntroubles you; may I ask what it is?\"\n\n\"Mon Dieu, monsieur, I was afraid. My satchel contains diamonds to the\nvalue of a hundred thousand francs, and the conduct of your friend was\nrather suspicious.\"\n\n\"But you were frequently absent from Paris. How do you explain that?\"\n\n\"I make frequent journeys to other cities in the course of my business.\nThat is all.\"\n\nMon. Dudouis had nothing more to ask. He turned to his subordinate, and\nsaid:\n\n\"Your investigation has been very superficial, Ganimard, and your\nconduct toward this lady is really deplorable. You will come to my\noffice to-morrow and explain it.\"\n\nThe interview was at an end, and Mon. Dudouis was about to leave the\nroom when a most annoying incident occurred. Madame R\u00c3\u00a9al turned to\nGanimard, and said:\n\n\"I understand that you are Monsieur Ganimard. Am I right?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then, this letter must be for you. I received it this morning. It was\naddressed to 'Mon. Justin Ganimard, care of Madame R\u00c3\u00a9al.' I thought it\nwas a joke, because I did not know you under that name, but it appears\nthat your unknown correspondent knew of our rendezvous.\"\n\nGanimard was inclined to put the letter in his pocket unread, but he\ndared not do so in the presence of his superior, so he opened the\nenvelope and read the letter aloud, in an almost inaudible tone:\n\n     \"Once upon a time, there were a blonde Lady, a Lupin, and a\n     Ganimard. Now, the wicked Ganimard had evil designs on the pretty\n     blonde Lady, and the good Lupin was her friend and protector. When\n     the good Lupin wished the blonde Lady to become the friend of the\n     Countess de Crozon, he caused her to assume the name of Madame de\n     R\u00c3\u00a9al, which is a close resemblance to the name of a certain diamond\n     broker, a woman with a pale complexion and golden hair. And the\n     good Lupin said to himself: If ever the wicked Ganimard gets upon\n     the track of the blonde Lady, how useful it will be to me if he\n     should be diverted to the track of the honest diamond broker. A\n     wise precaution that has borne good fruit. A little note sent to\n     the newspaper read by the wicked Ganimard, a perfume bottle\n     intentionally forgotten by the genuine blonde Lady at the H\u00c3\u00b4tel\n     Beaurivage, the name and address of Madame R\u00c3\u00a9al written on the\n     hotel register by the genuine blonde Lady, and the trick is played.\n     What do you think of it, Ganimard! I wished to tell you the true\n     story of this affair, knowing that you would be the first to laugh\n     over it. Really, it is quite amusing, and I have enjoyed it very\n     much.\n\n     \"Accept my best wishes, dear friend, and give my kind regards to\n     the worthy Mon. Dudouis.\n\n     \"ARS\u00c3\u0088NE LUPIN.\"\n\n\"He knows everything,\" muttered Ganimard, but he did not see the humor\nof the situation as Lupin had predicted. \"He knows some things I have\nnever mentioned to any one. How could he find out that I was going to\ninvite you here, chief? How could he know that I had found the first\nperfume bottle? How could he find out those things?\"\n\nHe stamped his feet and tore his hair--a prey to the most tragic\ndespair. Mon. Dudouis felt sorry for him, and said:\n\n\"Come, Ganimard, never mind; try to do better next time.\"\n\nAnd Mon. Dudouis left the room, accompanied by Madame R\u00c3\u00a9al.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the next ten minutes, Ganimard read and re-read the letter of\nArs\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin. Monsieur and Madame de Crozon, Monsieur d'Hautrec and\nMonsieur Gerbois were holding an animated discussion in a corner of the\nroom. At last, the count approached the detective, and said:\n\n\"My dear monsieur, after your investigation, we are no nearer the truth\nthan we were before.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, but my investigation has established these facts: that the\nblonde Lady is the mysterious heroine of these exploits, and that Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne\nLupin directed them.\"\n\n\"Those facts do not solve the mystery; in fact, they render it more\nobscure. The blonde Lady commits a murder in order to steal the blue\ndiamond, and yet she does not steal it. Afterward she steals it and gets\nrid of it by secretly giving it to another person. How do you explain\nher strange conduct?\"\n\n\"I cannot explain it.\"\n\n\"Of course; but, perhaps, someone else can.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\nThe Count hesitated, so the Countess replied, frankly:\n\n\"There is only one man besides yourself who is competent to enter the\narena with Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin and overcome him. Have you any objection to our\nengaging the services of Herlock Sholmes in this case?\"\n\nGanimard was vexed at the question, but stammered a reply:\n\n\"No ... but ... I do not understand what----\"\n\n\"Let me explain. All this mystery annoys me. I wish to have it cleared\nup. Monsieur Gerbois and Monsieur d'Hautrec have the same desire, and we\nhave agreed to send for the celebrated English detective.\"\n\n\"You are right, madame,\" replied the detective, with a loyalty that did\nhim credit, \"you are right. Old Ganimard is not able to overcome Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne\nLupin. But will Herlock Sholmes succeed? I hope so, as I have the\ngreatest admiration for him. But ... it is improbable.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that he will not succeed?\"\n\n\"That is my opinion. I can foresee the result of a duel between Herlock\nSholmes and Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin. The Englishman will be defeated.\"\n\n\"But, in any event, can we count on your assistance?\"\n\n\"Quite so, madame. I shall be pleased to render Monsieur Sholmes all\npossible assistance.\"\n\n\"Do you know his address?\"\n\n\"Yes; 219 Parker street.\"\n\nThat evening Monsieur and Madame de Crozon withdrew the charge they had\nmade against Herr Bleichen, and a joint letter was addressed to Herlock\nSholmes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nHERLOCK SHOLMES OPENS HOSTILITIES.\n\n\n\"What does monsieur wish?\"\n\n\"Anything,\" replied Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin, like a man who never worries over the\ndetails of a meal; \"anything you like, but no meat or alcohol.\"\n\nThe waiter walked away, disdainfully.\n\n\"What! still a vegetarian?\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"More so than ever,\" replied Lupin.\n\n\"Through taste, faith, or habit?\"\n\n\"Hygiene.\"\n\n\"And do you never fall from grace?\"\n\n\"Oh! yes ... when I am dining out ... and wish to avoid being considered\neccentric.\"\n\nWe were dining near the Northern Railway station, in a little restaurant\nto which Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin had invited me. Frequently he would send me a\ntelegram asking me to meet him in some obscure restaurant, where we\ncould enjoy a quiet dinner, well served, and which was always made\ninteresting to me by his recital of some startling adventure\ntheretofore unknown to me.\n\nOn that particular evening he appeared to be in a more lively mood than\nusual. He laughed and joked with careless animation, and with that\ndelicate sarcasm that was habitual with him--a light and spontaneous\nsarcasm that was quite free from any tinge of malice. It was a pleasure\nto find him in that jovial mood, and I could not resist the desire to\ntell him so.\n\n\"Ah! yes,\" he exclaimed, \"there are days in which I find life as bright\nand gay as a spring morning; then life seems to be an infinite treasure\nwhich I can never exhaust. And yet God knows I lead a careless\nexistence!\"\n\n\"Too much so, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Ah! but I tell you, the treasure is infinite. I can spend it with a\nlavish hand. I can cast my youth and strength to the four winds of\nHeaven, and it is replaced by a still younger and greater force.\nBesides, my life is so pleasant!... If I wished to do so, I might\nbecome--what shall I say?... An orator, a manufacturer, a politician....\nBut, I assure you, I shall never have such a desire. Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin, I am;\nArs\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin, I shall remain. I have made a vain search in history to\nfind a career comparable to mine; a life better filled or more\nintense.... Napoleon? Yes, perhaps.... But Napoleon, toward the close of\nhis career, when all Europe was trying to crush him, asked himself on\nthe eve of each battle if it would not be his last.\"\n\nWas he serious? Or was he joking? He became more animated as he\nproceeded:\n\n\"That is everything, do you understand, the danger! The continuous\nfeeling of danger! To breathe it as you breathe the air, to scent it in\nevery breath of wind, to detect it in every unusual sound.... And, in\nthe midst of the tempest, to remain calm ... and not to stumble!\nOtherwise, you are lost. There is only one sensation equal to it: that\nof the chauffeur in an automobile race. But that race lasts only a few\nhours; my race continues until death!\"\n\n\"What fantasy!\" I exclaimed. \"And you wish me to believe that you have\nno particular motive for your adoption of that exciting life?\"\n\n\"Come,\" he said, with a smile, \"you are a clever psychologist. Work it\nout for yourself.\"\n\nHe poured himself a glass of water, drank it, and said:\n\n\"Did you read _'Le Temps'_ to-day?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Herlock Sholmes crossed the Channel this afternoon, and arrived in\nParis about six o'clock.\"\n\n\"The deuce! What is he coming for?\"\n\n\"A little journey he has undertaken at the request of the Count and\nCountess of Crozon, Monsieur Gerbois, and the nephew of Baron d'Hautrec.\nThey met him at the Northern Railway station, took him to meet Ganimard,\nand, at this moment, the six of them are holding a consultation.\"\n\nDespite a strong temptation to do so, I had never ventured to question\nArs\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin concerning any action of his private life, unless he had\nfirst mentioned the subject to me. Up to that moment his name had not\nbeen mentioned, at least officially, in connection with the blue\ndiamond. Consequently, I consumed my curiosity in patience. He\ncontinued:\n\n\"There is also in _'Le Temps'_ an interview with my old friend Ganimard,\naccording to whom a certain blonde lady, who should be my friend, must\nhave murdered the Baron d'Hautrec and tried to rob Madame de Crozon of\nher famous ring. And--what do you think?--he accuses me of being the\ninstigator of those crimes.\"\n\nI could not suppress a slight shudder. Was this true? Must I believe\nthat his career of theft, his mode of existence, the logical result of\nsuch a life, had drawn that man into more serious crimes, including\nmurder? I looked at him. He was so calm, and his eyes had such a frank\nexpression! I observed his hands: they had been formed from a model of\nexceeding delicacy, long and slender; inoffensive, truly; and the hands\nof an artist....\n\n\"Ganimard has pipe-dreams,\" I said.\n\n\"No, no!\" protested Lupin. \"Ganimard has some cleverness; and, at times,\nalmost inspiration.\"\n\n\"Inspiration!\"\n\n\"Yes. For instance, that interview is a master-stroke. In the first\nplace, he announces the coming of his English rival in order to put me\non my guard, and make his task more difficult. In the second place, he\nindicates the exact point to which he has conducted the affair in order\nthat Sholmes will not get credit for the work already done by Ganimard.\nThat is good warfare.\"\n\n\"Whatever it may be, you have two adversaries to deal with, and such\nadversaries!\"\n\n\"Oh! one of them doesn't count.\"\n\n\"And the other?\"\n\n\"Sholmes? Oh! I confess he is a worthy foe; and that explains my present\ngood humor. In the first place, it is a question of self-esteem; I am\npleased to know that they consider me a subject worthy the attention of\nthe celebrated English detective. In the next place, just imagine the\npleasure a man, such as I, must experience in the thought of a duel with\nHerlock Sholmes. But I shall be obliged to strain every muscle; he is a\nclever fellow, and will contest every inch of the ground.\"\n\n\"Then you consider him a strong opponent?\"\n\n\"I do. As a detective, I believe, he has never had an equal. But I have\none advantage over him; he is making the attack and I am simply\ndefending myself. My r\u00c3\u00b4le is the easier one. Besides, I am familiar with\nhis method of warfare, and he does not know mine. I am prepared to show\nhim a few new tricks that will give him something to think about.\"\n\nHe tapped the table with his fingers as he uttered the following\nsentences, with an air of keen delight:\n\n\"Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin against Herlock Sholmes.... France against England....\nTrafalgar will be revenged at last.... Ah! the rascal ... he doesn't\nsuspect that I am prepared ... and a Lupin warned--\"\n\nHe stopped suddenly, seized with a fit of coughing, and hid his face in\nhis napkin, as if something had stuck in his throat.\n\n\"A bit of bread?\" I inquired. \"Drink some water.\"\n\n\"No, it isn't that,\" he replied, in a stifled voice.\n\n\"Then, what is it?\"\n\n\"The want of air.\"\n\n\"Do you wish a window opened?\"\n\n\"No, I shall go out. Give me my hat and overcoat, quick! I must go.\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"The two gentlemen who came in just now.... Look at the taller one ...\nnow, when we go out, keep to my left, so he will not see me.\"\n\n\"The one who is sitting behind you?\"\n\n\"Yes. I will explain it to you, outside.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\"\n\n\"Herlock Sholmes.\"\n\nHe made a desperate effort to control himself, as if he were ashamed of\nhis emotion, replaced his napkin, drank a glass of water, and, quite\nrecovered, said to me, smiling:\n\n\"It is strange, hein, that I should be affected so easily, but that\nunexpected sight--\"\n\n\"What have you to fear, since no one can recognize you, on account of\nyour many transformations? Every time I see you it seems to me your face\nis changed; it's not at all familiar. I don't know why.\"\n\n\"But _he_ would recognize me,\" said Lupin. \"He has seen me only once;\nbut, at that time, he made a mental photograph of me--not of my external\nappearance but of my very soul--not what I appear to be but just what I\nam. Do you understand? And then ... and then.... I did not expect to\nmeet him here.... Such a strange encounter!... in this little\nrestaurant....\"\n\n\"Well, shall we go out?\"\n\n\"No, not now,\" said Lupin.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"The better way is to act frankly ... to have confidence in him--trust\nhim....\"\n\n\"You will not speak to him?\"\n\n\"Why not! It will be to my advantage to do so, and find out what he\nknows, and, perhaps, what he thinks. At present I have the feeling that\nhis gaze is on my neck and shoulders, and that he is trying to remember\nwhere he has seen them before.\"\n\nHe reflected a moment. I observed a malicious smile at the corner of his\nmouth; then, obedient, I think, to a whim of his impulsive nature, and\nnot to the necessities of the situation, he arose, turned around, and,\nwith a bow and a joyous air, he said:\n\n\"By what lucky chance? Ah! I am delighted to see you. Permit me to\nintroduce a friend of mine.\"\n\nFor a moment the Englishman was disconcerted; then he made a movement as\nif he would seize Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin. The latter shook his head, and said:\n\n\"That would not be fair; besides, the movement would be an awkward one\nand ... quite useless.\"\n\nThe Englishman looked about him, as if in search of assistance.\n\n\"No use,\" said Lupin. \"Besides, are you quite sure you can place your\nhand on me? Come, now, show me that you are a real Englishman and,\ntherefore, a good sport.\"\n\nThis advice seemed to commend itself to the detective, for he partially\nrose and said, very formally:\n\n\"Monsieur Wilson, my friend and assistant--Monsieur Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin.\"\n\nWilson's amazement evoked a laugh. With bulging eyes and gaping mouth,\nhe looked from one to the other, as if unable to comprehend the\nsituation. Herlock Sholmes laughed and said:\n\n\"Wilson, you should conceal your astonishment at an incident which is\none of the most natural in the world.\"\n\n\"Why do you not arrest him?\" stammered Wilson.\n\n\"Have you not observed, Wilson, that the gentleman is between me and the\ndoor, and only a few steps from the door. By the time I could move my\nlittle finger he would be outside.\"\n\n\"Don't let that make any difference,\" said Lupin, who now walked around\nthe table and seated himself so that the Englishman was between him and\nthe door--thus placing himself at the mercy of the foreigner.\n\nWilson looked at Sholmes to find out if he had the right to admire this\nact of wanton courage. The Englishman's face was impenetrable; but, a\nmoment later, he called:\n\n\"Waiter!\"\n\nWhen the waiter came he ordered soda, beer and whisky. The treaty of\npeace was signed--until further orders. In a few moments the four men\nwere conversing in an apparently friendly manner.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHerlock Sholmes is a man such as you might meet every day in the\nbusiness world. He is about fifty years of age, and looks as if he might\nhave passed his life in an office, adding up columns of dull figures or\nwriting out formal statements of business accounts. There was nothing to\ndistinguish him from the average citizen of London, except the\nappearance of his eyes, his terribly keen and penetrating eyes.\n\nBut then he is Herlock Sholmes--which means that he is a wonderful\ncombination of intuition, observation, clairvoyance and ingenuity. One\ncould readily believe that nature had been pleased to take the two most\nextraordinary detectives that the imagination of man has hitherto\nconceived, the Dupin of Edgar Allen Poe and the Lecoq of Emile Gaboriau,\nand, out of that material, constructed a new detective, more\nextraordinary and supernatural than either of them. And when a person\nreads the history of his exploits, which have made him famous\nthroughout the entire world, he asks himself whether Herlock Sholmes is\nnot a mythical personage, a fictitious hero born in the brain of a great\nnovelist--Conan Doyle, for instance.\n\nWhen Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin questioned him in regard to the length of his sojourn\nin France he turned the conversation into its proper channel by saying:\n\n\"That depends on you, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Lupin, laughing, \"if it depends on me you can return to\nEngland to-night.\"\n\n\"That is a little too soon, but I expect to return in the course of\neight or nine days--ten at the outside.\"\n\n\"Are you in such a hurry?\"\n\n\"I have many cases to attend to; such as the robbery of the\nAnglo-Chinese Bank, the abduction of Lady Eccleston.... But, don't you\nthink, Monsieur Lupin, that I can finish my business in Paris within a\nweek?\"\n\n\"Certainly, if you confine your efforts to the case of the blue diamond.\nIt is, moreover, the length of time that I require to make preparations\nfor my safety in case the solution of that affair should give you\ncertain dangerous advantages over me.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said the Englishman, \"I expect to close the business in eight\nor ten days.\"\n\n\"And arrest me on the eleventh, perhaps?\"\n\n\"No, the tenth is my limit.\"\n\nLupin shook his head thoughtfully, as he said:\n\n\"That will be difficult--very difficult.\"\n\n\"Difficult, perhaps, but possible, therefore certain--\"\n\n\"Absolutely certain,\" said Wilson, as if he had clearly worked out the\nlong series of operations which would conduct his collaborator to the\ndesired result.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Herlock Sholmes, \"I do not hold all the trump cards,\nas these cases are already several months old, and I lack certain\ninformation and clues upon which I am accustomed to base my\ninvestigations.\"\n\n\"Such as spots of mud and cigarette ashes,\" said Wilson, with an air of\nimportance.\n\n\"In addition to the remarkable conclusions formed by Monsieur Ganimard,\nI have obtained all the articles written on the subject, and have formed\na few deductions of my own.\"\n\n\"Some ideas which were suggested to us by analysis or hypothesis,\"\nadded Wilson, sententiously.\n\n\"I wish to enquire,\" said Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin, in that deferential tone which\nhe employed in speaking to Sholmes, \"would I be indiscreet if I were to\nask you what opinion you have formed about the case?\"\n\nReally, it was a most exciting situation to see those two men facing\neach other across the table, engaged in an earnest discussion as if they\nwere obliged to solve some abstruse problem or come to an agreement upon\nsome controverted fact. Wilson was in the seventh heaven of delight.\nHerlock Sholmes filled his pipe slowly, lighted it, and said:\n\n\"This affair is much simpler than it appeared to be at first sight.\"\n\n\"Much simpler,\" said Wilson, as a faithful echo.\n\n\"I say 'this affair,' for, in my opinion, there is only one,\" said\nSholmes. \"The death of the Baron d'Hautrec, the story of the ring, and,\nlet us not forget, the mystery of lottery ticket number 514, are only\ndifferent phases of what one might call the mystery of the blonde Lady.\nNow, according to my view, it is simply a question of discovering the\nbond that unites those three episodes in the same story--the fact which\nproves the unity of the three events. Ganimard, whose judgment is rather\nsuperficial, finds that unity in the faculty of disappearance; that is,\nin the power of coming and going unseen and unheard. That theory does\nnot satisfy me.\"\n\n\"Well, what is your idea?\" asked Lupin.\n\n\"In my opinion,\" said Sholmes, \"the characteristic feature of the three\nepisodes is your design and purpose of leading the affair into a certain\nchannel previously chosen by you. It is, on your part, more than a plan;\nit is a necessity, an indispensable condition of success.\"\n\n\"Can you furnish any details of your theory?\"\n\n\"Certainly. For example, from the beginning of your conflict with\nMonsieur Gerbois, is it not evident that the apartment of Monsieur\nDetinan is the place selected by you, the inevitable spot where all the\nparties must meet? In your opinion, it was the only safe place, and you\narranged a rendezvous there, publicly, one might say, for the blonde\nLady and Mademoiselle Gerbois.\"\n\n\"The professor's daughter,\" added Wilson. \"Now, let us consider the\ncase of the blue diamond. Did you try to appropriate it while the Baron\nd'Hautrec possessed it! No. But the baron takes his brother's house. Six\nmonths later we have the intervention of Antoinette Br\u00c3\u00a9hat and the first\nattempt. The diamond escapes you, and the sale is widely advertised to\ntake place at the Drouot auction-rooms. Will it be a free and open sale?\nIs the richest amateur sure to carry off the jewel! No. Just as the\nbanker Herschmann is on the point of buying the ring, a lady sends him a\nletter of warning, and it is the Countess de Crozon, prepared and\ninfluenced by the same lady, who becomes the purchaser of the diamond.\nWill the ring disappear at once? No; you lack the opportunity.\nTherefore, you must wait. At last the Countess goes to her ch\u00c3\u00a2teau. That\nis what you were waiting for. The ring disappears.\"\n\n\"To reappear again in the tooth-powder of Herr Bleichen,\" remarked\nLupin.\n\n\"Oh! such nonsense!\" exclaimed Sholmes, striking the table with his\nfist, \"don't tell me such a fairy tale. I am too old a fox to be led\naway by a false scent.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"What do I mean?\" said Sholmes, then paused a moment as if he wished to\narrange his effect. At last he said:\n\n\"The blue diamond that was found in the tooth-powder was false. You kept\nthe genuine stone.\"\n\nArs\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin remained silent for a moment; then, with his eyes fixed on\nthe Englishman, he replied, calmly:\n\n\"You are impertinent, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Impertinent, indeed!\" repeated Wilson, beaming with admiration.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lupin, \"and, yet, to do you credit, you have thrown a strong\nlight on a very mysterious subject. Not a magistrate, not a special\nreporter, who has been engaged on this case, has come so near the truth.\nIt is a marvellous display of intuition and logic.\"\n\n\"Oh! a person has simply to use his brains,\" said Herlock Sholmes,\nnattered at the homage of the expert criminal.\n\n\"And so few have any brains to use,\" replied Lupin. \"And, now, that the\nfield of conjectures has been narrowed down, and the rubbish cleared\naway----\"\n\n\"Well, now, I have simply to discover why the three episodes were\nenacted at 25 rue Clapeyron, 134 avenue Henri-Martin, and within the\nwalls of the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau de Crozon and my work will be finished. What\nremains will be child's play. Don't you think so?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think you are right.\"\n\n\"In that case, Monsieur Lupin, am I wrong in saying that my business\nwill be finished in ten days?\"\n\n\"In ten days you will know the whole truth,\" said Lupin.\n\n\"And you will be arrested.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"In order that I may be arrested there must occur such a series of\nimprobable and unexpected misfortunes that I cannot admit the\npossibility of such an event.\"\n\n\"We have a saying in England that 'the unexpected always happens.'\"\n\nThey looked at each other for a moment calmly and fearlessly, without\nany display of bravado or malice. They met as equals in a contest of wit\nand skill. And this meeting was the formal crossing of swords,\npreliminary to the duel.\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Lupin, \"at last I shall have an adversary worthy of the\nname--one whose defeat will be the proudest achievement in my career.\"\n\n\"Are you not afraid!\" asked Wilson.\n\n\"Almost, Monsieur Wilson,\" replied Lupin, rising from his chair, \"and\nthe proof is that I am about to make a hasty retreat. Then, we will say\nten days, Monsieur Sholmes?\"\n\n\"Yes, ten days. This is Sunday. A week from next Wednesday, at eight\no'clock in the evening, it will be all over.\"\n\n\"And I shall be in prison?\"\n\n\"No doubt of it.\"\n\n\"Ha! not a pleasant outlook for a man who gets so much enjoyment out of\nlife as I do. No cares, a lively interest in the affairs of the world, a\njustifiable contempt for the police, and the consoling sympathy of\nnumerous friends and admirers. And now, behold, all that is about to be\nchanged! It is the reverse side of the medal. After sunshine comes the\nrain. It is no longer a laughing matter. Adieu!\"\n\n\"Hurry up!\" said Wilson, full of solicitude for a person in whom Herlock\nSholmes had inspired so much respect, \"do not lose a minute.\"\n\n\"Not a minute, Monsieur Wilson; but I wish to express my pleasure at\nhaving met you, and to tell you how much I envy the master in having\nsuch a valuable assistant as you seem to be.\"\n\nThen, after they had courteously saluted each other, like adversaries in\na duel who entertain no feeling of malice but are obliged to fight by\nforce of circumstances, Lupin seized me by the arm and drew me outside.\n\n\"What do you think of it, dear boy? The strange events of this evening\nwill form an interesting chapter in the memoirs you are now preparing\nfor me.\"\n\nHe closed the door of the restaurant behind us, and, after taking a few\nsteps, he stopped and said:\n\n\"Do you smoke?\"\n\n\"No. Nor do you, it seems to me.\"\n\n\"You are right, I don't.\"\n\nHe lighted a cigarette with a wax-match, which he shook several times in\nan effort to extinguish it. But he threw away the cigarette immediately,\nran across the street, and joined two men who emerged from the shadows\nas if called by a signal. He conversed with them for a few minutes on\nthe opposite sidewalk, and then returned to me.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, but I fear that cursed Sholmes is going to give me\ntrouble. But, I assure you, he is not yet through with Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin. He\nwill find out what kind of fuel I use to warm my blood. And now--au\nrevoir! The genial Wilson is right; there is not a moment to lose.\"\n\nHe walked away rapidly.\n\nThus ended the events of that exciting evening, or, at least, that part\nof them in which I was a participant. Subsequently, during the course of\nthe evening, other stirring incidents occurred which have come to my\nknowledge through the courtesy of other members of that unique\ndinner-party.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the very moment in which Lupin left me, Herlock Sholmes rose from the\ntable, and looked at his watch.\n\n\"Twenty minutes to nine. At nine o'clock I am to meet the Count and\nCountess at the railway station.\"\n\n\"Then, we must be off!\" exclaimed Wilson, between two drinks of whisky.\n\nThey left the restaurant.\n\n\"Wilson, don't look behind. We may be followed, and, in that case, let\nus act as if we did not care. Wilson, I want your opinion: why was Lupin\nin that restaurant?\"\n\n\"To get something to eat,\" replied Wilson, quickly.\n\n\"Wilson, I must congratulate you on the accuracy of your deduction. I\ncouldn't have done better myself.\"\n\nWilson blushed with pleasure, and Sholmes continued:\n\n\"To get something to eat. Very well, and, after that, probably, to\nassure himself whether I am going to the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau de Crozon, as announced\nby Ganimard in his interview. I must go in order not to disappoint him.\nBut, in order to gain time on him, I shall not go.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Wilson, nonplused.\n\n\"You, my friend, will walk down this street, take a carriage, two, three\ncarriages. Return later and get the valises that we left at the station,\nand make for the Elys\u00c3\u00a9e-Palace at a galop.\"\n\n\"And when I reach the Elys\u00c3\u00a9e-Palace?\"\n\n\"Engage a room, go to sleep, and await my orders.\"\n\nQuite proud of the important r\u00c3\u00b4le assigned to him, Wilson set out to\nperform his task. Herlock Sholmes proceeded to the railway station,\nbought a ticket, and repaired to the Amiens' express in which the Count\nand Countess de Crozon were already installed. He bowed to them, lighted\nhis pipe, and had a quiet smoke in the corridor. The train started. Ten\nminutes later he took a seat beside the Countess, and said to her:\n\n\"Have you the ring here, madame?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Will you kindly let me see it?\"\n\nHe took it, and examined it closely.\n\n\"Just as I suspected: it is a manufactured diamond.\"\n\n\"A manufactured diamond?\"\n\n\"Yes; a new process which consists in submitting diamond dust to a\ntremendous heat until it melts and is then molded into a single stone.\"\n\n\"But my diamond is genuine.\"\n\n\"Yes, _your_ diamond is; but this is not yours.\"\n\n\"Where is mine?\"\n\n\"It is held by Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin.\"\n\n\"And this stone?\"\n\n\"Was substituted for yours, and slipped into Herr Bleichen's\ntooth-powder, where it was afterwards found.\"\n\n\"Then you think this is false?\"\n\n\"Absolutely false.\"\n\nThe Countess was overwhelmed with surprise and grief, while her husband\nscrutinized the diamond with an incredulous air. Finally she stammered:\n\n\"Is it possible? And why did they not merely steal it and be done with\nit? And how did they steal it?\"\n\n\"That is exactly what I am going to find out.\"\n\n\"At the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau de Crozon?\"\n\n\"No. I shall leave the train at Creil and return to Paris. It is there\nthe game between me and Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin must be played. In fact, the game\nhas commenced already, and Lupin thinks I am on my way to the ch\u00c3\u00a2teau.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"What does it matter to you, madame? The essential thing is your\ndiamond, is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, don't worry. I have just undertaken a much more difficult task\nthan that. You have my promise that I will restore the true diamond to\nyou within ten days.\"\n\nThe train slackened its speed. He put the false diamond in his pocket\nand opened the door. The Count cried out:\n\n\"That is the wrong side of the train. You are getting out on the\ntracks.\"\n\n\"That is my intention. If Lupin has anyone on my track, he will lose\nsight of me now. Adieu.\"\n\nAn employee protested in vain. After the departure of the train, the\nEnglishman sought the station-master's office. Forty minutes later he\nleaped into a train that landed him in Paris shortly before midnight. He\nran across the platform, entered the lunch-room, made his exit at\nanother door, and jumped into a cab.\n\n\"Driver--rue Clapeyron.\"\n\nHaving reached the conclusion that he was not followed, he stopped the\ncarriage at the end of the street, and proceeded to make a careful\nexamination of Monsieur Detinan's house and the two adjoining houses. He\nmade measurements of certain distances and entered the figures in his\nnotebook.\n\n\"Driver--avenue Henri-Martin.\"\n\nAt the corner of the avenue and the rue de la Pompe, he dismissed the\ncarriage, walked down the street to number 134, and performed the same\noperations in front of the house of the late Baron d'Hautrec and the two\nadjoining houses, measuring the width of the respective fa\u00c3\u00a7ades and\ncalculating the depth of the little gardens that stood in front of\nthem.\n\nThe avenue was deserted, and was very dark under its four rows of trees,\nbetween which, at considerable intervals, a few gas-lamps struggled in\nvain to light the deep shadows. One of them threw a dim light over a\nportion of the house, and Sholmes perceived the \"To-let\" sign posted on\nthe gate, the neglected walks which encircled the small lawn, and the\nlarge bare windows of the vacant house.\n\n\"I suppose,\" he said to himself, \"the house has been unoccupied since\nthe death of the baron.... Ah! if I could only get in and view the scene\nof the murder!\"\n\nNo sooner did the idea occur to him than he sought to put it in\nexecution. But how could he manage it? He could not climb over the gate;\nit was too high. So he took from his pocket an electric lantern and a\nskeleton key which he always carried. Then, to his great surprise, he\ndiscovered that the gate was not locked; in fact, it was open about\nthree or four inches. He entered the garden, and was careful to leave\nthe gate as he had found it--partly open. But he had not taken many\nsteps from the gate when he stopped. He had seen a light pass one of\nthe windows on the second floor.\n\nHe saw the light pass a second window and a third, but he saw nothing\nelse, except a silhouette outlined on the walls of the rooms. The light\ndescended to the first floor, and, for a long time, wandered from room\nto room.\n\n\"Who the deuce is walking, at one o'clock in the morning, through the\nhouse in which the Baron d'Hautrec was killed?\" Herlock Sholmes asked\nhimself, deeply interested.\n\nThere was only one way to find out, and that was to enter the house\nhimself. He did not hesitate, but started for the door of the house.\nHowever, at the moment when he crossed the streak of gaslight that came\nfrom the street-lamp, the man must have seen him, for the light in the\nhouse was suddenly extinguished and Herlock Sholmes did not see it\nagain. Softly, he tried the door. It was open, also. Hearing no sound,\nhe advanced through the hallway, encountered the foot of the stairs, and\nascended to the first floor. Here there was the same silence, the same\ndarkness.\n\nHe entered, one of the rooms and approached a window through which came\na feeble light from the outside. On looking through the window he saw\nthe man, who had no doubt descended by another stairway and escaped by\nanother door. The man was threading his way through the shrubbery which\nbordered the wall that separated the two gardens.\n\n\"The deuce!\" exclaimed Sholmes, \"he is going to escape.\"\n\nHe hastened down the stairs and leaped over the steps in his eagerness\nto cut off the man's retreat. But he did not see anyone, and, owing to\nthe darkness, it was several seconds before he was able to distinguish a\nbulky form moving through the shrubbery. This gave the Englishman food\nfor reflection. Why had the man not made his escape, which he could have\ndone so easily? Had he remained in order to watch the movements of the\nintruder who had disturbed him in his mysterious work?\n\n\"At all events,\" concluded Sholmes, \"it is not Lupin; he would be more\nadroit. It may be one of his men.\"\n\nFor several minutes Herlock Sholmes remained motionless, with his gaze\nfixed on the adversary who, in his turn was watching the detective. But\nas that adversary had become passive, and as the Englishman was not one\nto consume his time in idle waiting, he examined his revolver to see if\nit was in good working order, remove his knife from its sheath, and\nwalked toward the enemy with that cool effrontery and scorn of danger\nfor which he had become famous.\n\nHe heard a clicking sound; it was his adversary preparing his revolver.\nHerlock Sholmes dashed boldly into the thicket, and grappled with his\nfoe. There was a sharp, desperate struggle, in the course of which\nSholmes suspected that the man was trying to draw a knife. But the\nEnglishman, believing his antagonist to be an accomplice of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin\nand anxious to win the first trick in the game with that redoubtable\nfoe, fought with unusual strength and determination. He hurled his\nadversary to the ground, held him there with the weight of his body,\nand, gripping him by the throat with one hand, he used his free hand to\ntake out his electric lantern, press the button, and throw the light\nover the face of his prisoner.\n\n\"Wilson!\" he exclaimed, in amazement.\n\n\"Herlock Sholmes!\" stammered a weak, stifled voice.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a long time they remained silent, astounded, foolish. The shriek of\nan automobile rent the air. A slight breeze stirred the leaves.\nSuddenly, Herlock Sholmes seized his friend by the shoulders and shook\nhim violently, as he cried:\n\n\"What are you doing here? Tell me.... What?... Did I tell you to hide in\nthe bushes and spy on me!\"\n\n\"Spy on you!\" muttered Wilson, \"why, I didn't know it was you.\"\n\n\"But what are you doing here? You ought to be in bed.\"\n\n\"I was in bed.\"\n\n\"You ought to be asleep.\"\n\n\"I was asleep.\"\n\n\"Well, what brought you here?\" asked Sholmes.\n\n\"Your letter.\"\n\n\"My letter? I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Yes, a messenger brought it to me at the hotel.\"\n\n\"From me? Are you crazy?\"\n\n\"It is true--I swear it.\"\n\n\"Where is the letter?\"\n\nWilson handed him a sheet of paper, which he read by the light of his\nlantern. It was as follows:\n\n\"Wilson, come at once to avenue Henri-Martin. The house is empty.\nInspect the whole place and make an exact plan. Then return to\nhotel.--Herlock Sholmes.\"\n\n\"I was measuring the rooms,\" said Wilson, \"when I saw a shadow in the\ngarden. I had only one idea----\"\n\n\"That was to seize the shadow.... The idea was excellent.... But\nremember this, Wilson, whenever you receive a letter from me, be sure it\nis my handwriting and not a forgery.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Wilson, as the truth dawned on him, \"then the letter\nwasn't from you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Who sent it, then?\"\n\n\"Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin.\"\n\n\"Why? For what purpose?\" asked Wilson.\n\n\"I don't know, and that's what worries me. I don't understand why he\ntook the trouble to disturb you. Of course, if he had sent me on such a\nfoolish errand I wouldn't be surprised; but what was his object in\ndisturbing you?\"\n\n\"I must hurry back to the hotel.\"\n\n\"So must I, Wilson.\"\n\nThey arrived at the gate. Wilson, who was ahead, took hold of it and\npulled.\n\n\"Ah! you closed it?\" he said.\n\n\"No, I left it partly open.\"\n\nSholmes tried the gate; then, alarmed, he examined the lock. An oath\nescaped him:\n\n\"Good God! it is locked! locked with a key!\"\n\nHe shook the gate with all his strength; then, realizing the futility of\nhis efforts, he dropped his arms, discouraged, and muttered, in a jerky\nmanner:\n\n\"I can see it all now--it is Lupin. He fore-saw that I would leave the\ntrain at Creil, and he prepared this neat little trap for me in case I\nshould commence my investigation this evening. Moreover, he was kind\nenough to send me a companion to share my captivity. All done to make me\nlose a day, and, perhaps, also, to teach me to mind my own business.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say we are prisoners?\"\n\n\"Exactly. Herlock Sholmes and Wilson are the prisoners of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin.\nIt's a bad beginning; but he laughs best who laughs last.\"\n\nWilson seized Sholmes' arm, and exclaimed:\n\n\"Look!... Look up there!... A light....\"\n\nA light shone through one of the windows of the first floor. Both of\nthem ran to the house, and each ascended by the stairs he had used on\ncoming out a short time before, and they met again at the entrance to\nthe lighted chamber. A small piece of a candle was burning in the center\nof the room. Beside it there was a basket containing a bottle, a roasted\nchicken, and a loaf of bread.\n\nSholmes was greatly amused, and laughed heartily.\n\n\"Wonderful! we are invited to supper. It is really an enchanted place, a\ngenuine fairy-land. Come, Wilson, cheer up! this is not a funeral. It's\nall very funny.\"\n\n\"Are you quite sure it is so very funny?\" asked Wilson, in a lugubrious\ntone.\n\n\"Am I sure?\" exclaimed Sholmes, with a gaiety that was too boisterous to\nbe natural, \"why, to tell the truth, it's the funniest thing I ever saw.\nIt's a jolly good comedy! What a master of sarcasm this Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin is!\nHe makes a fool of you with the utmost grace and delicacy. I wouldn't\nmiss this feast for all the money in the Bank of England. Come, Wilson,\nyou grieve me. You should display that nobility of character which\nrises superior to misfortune. I don't see that you have any cause for\ncomplaint, really, I don't.\"\n\nAfter a time, by dint of good humor and sarcasm, he managed to restore\nWilson to his normal mood, and make him swallow a morsel of chicken and\na glass of wine. But when the candle went out and they prepared to spend\nthe night there, with the bare floor for a mattress and the hard wall\nfor a pillow, the harsh and ridiculous side of the situation was\nimpressed upon them. That particular incident will not form a pleasant\npage in the memoirs of the famous detective.\n\nNext morning Wilson awoke, stiff and cold. A slight noise attracted his\nattention: Herlock Sholmes was kneeling on the floor, critically\nexamining some grains of sand and studying some chalk-marks, now almost\neffaced, which formed certain figures and numbers, which figures he\nentered in his notebook.\n\nAccompanied by Wilson, who was deeply interested in the work, he\nexamined each room, and found similar chalk-marks in two other\napartments. He noticed, also, two circles on the oaken panels, an arrow\non a wainscot, and four figures on four steps of the stairs. At the end\nof an hour Wilson said:\n\n\"The figures are correct, aren't they?\"\n\n\"I don't know; but, at all events, they mean something,\" replied\nSholmes, who had forgotten the discomforts of the night in the joy\ncreated by his new discoveries.\n\n\"It is quite obvious,\" said Wilson, \"they represent the number of pieces\nin the floor.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"Yes. And the two circles indicate that the panels are false, as you can\nreadily ascertain, and the arrow points in the direction in which the\npanels move.\"\n\nHerlock Sholmes looked at Wilson, in astonishment.\n\n\"Ah! my dear friend, how do you know all that? Your clairvoyance makes\nmy poor ability in that direction look quite insignificant.\"\n\n\"Oh! it is very simple,\" said Wilson, inflated with pride; \"I examined\nthose marks last night, according to your instructions, or, rather,\naccording to the instructions of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin, since he wrote the letter\nyou sent to me.\"\n\nAt that moment Wilson faced a greater danger than he had during his\nstruggle in the garden with Herlock Sholmes. The latter now felt a\nfurious desire to strangle him. But, dominating his feelings, Sholmes\nmade a grimace which was intended for a smile, and said:\n\n\"Quite so, Wilson, you have done well, and your work shows commendable\nprogress. But, tell me, have you exercised your powers of observation\nand analysis on any other points? I might profit by your deductions.\"\n\n\"Oh! no, I went no farther.\"\n\n\"That's a pity. Your d\u00c3\u00a9but was such a promising one. But, since that is\nall, we may as well go.\"\n\n\"Go! but how can we get out?\"\n\n\"The way all honest people go out: through the gate.\"\n\n\"But it is locked.\"\n\n\"It will be opened.\"\n\n\"By whom?\"\n\n\"Please call the two policemen who are strolling down the avenue.\"\n\n\"But----\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"It is very humiliating. What will be said when it becomes known that\nHerlock Sholmes and Wilson were the prisoners of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin?\"\n\n\"Of course, I understand they will roar with laughter,\" replied Herlock\nSholmes, in a dry voice and with frowning features, \"but we can't set up\nhousekeeping in this place.\"\n\n\"And you will not try to find another way out?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But the man who brought us the basket of provisions did not cross the\ngarden, coming or going. There is some other way out. Let us look for\nit, and not bother with the police.\"\n\n\"Your argument is sound, but you forget that all the detectives in Paris\nhave been trying to find it for the last six months, and that I searched\nthe house from top to bottom while you were asleep. Ah! my dear Wilson,\nwe have not been accustomed to pursue such game as Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin. He\nleaves no trail behind him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt eleven o'clock, Herlock Sholmes and Wilson were liberated, and\nconducted to the nearest police station, where the commissary, after\nsubjecting them to a severe examination, released them with an\naffectation of good-will that was quite exasperating.\n\n\"I am very sorry, messieurs, that this unfortunate incident has\noccurred. You will have a very poor opinion of French hospitality. Mon\nDieu! what a night you must have passed! Ah! that rascally Lupin is no\nrespecter of persons.\"\n\nThey took a carriage to their hotel. At the office Wilson asked for the\nkey of his room.\n\nAfter some search the clerk replied, much astonished:\n\n\"But, monsieur, you have given up the room.\"\n\n\"I gave it up? When?\"\n\n\"This morning, by the letter your friend brought here.\"\n\n\"What friend?\"\n\n\"The gentleman who brought your letter.... Ah! your card is still\nattached to the letter. Here they are.\"\n\nWilson looked at them. Certainly, it was one of his cards, and the\nletter was in his handwriting.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" he muttered, \"this is another of his tricks,\" and he added,\naloud: \"Where is my luggage?\"\n\n\"Your friend took it.\"\n\n\"Ah!... and you gave it to him?\"\n\n\"Certainly; on the strength of your letter and card.\"\n\n\"Of course ... of course.\"\n\nThey left the hotel and walked, slowly and thoughtfully, through the\nChamps-Elys\u00c3\u00a9es. The avenue was bright and cheerful beneath a clear\nautumn sun; the air was mild and pleasant.\n\nAt Rond-Point, Herlock Sholmes lighted his pipe. Then Wilson spoke:\n\n\"I can't understand you, Sholmes. You are so calm and unruffled. They\nplay with you as a cat plays with a mouse, and yet you do not say a\nword.\"\n\nSholmes stopped, as he replied:\n\n\"Wilson, I was thinking of your card.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"The point is this: here is a man who, in view of a possible struggle\nwith us, procures specimens of our handwriting, and who holds, in his\npossession, one or more of your cards. Now, have you considered how much\nprecaution and skill those facts represent?\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, Wilson, to overcome an enemy so well prepared and so thoroughly\nequipped requires the infinite shrewdness of ... of a Herlock Sholmes.\nAnd yet, as you have seen, Wilson, I have lost the first round.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt six o'clock the _Echo de France_ published the following article in\nits evening edition:\n\n\"This morning Mon. Thenard, commissary of police in the sixteenth\ndistrict, released Herlock Sholmes and his friend Wilson, both of whom\nhad been locked in the house of the late Baron d'Hautrec, where they\nspent a very pleasant night--thanks to the thoughtful care and attention\nof Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin.\"\n\n\"In addition to their other troubles, these gentlemen have been robbed\nof their valises, and, in consequence thereof, they have entered a\nformal complaint against Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin.\"\n\n\"Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin, satisfied that he has given them a mild reproof, hopes\nthese gentlemen will not force him to resort to more stringent\nmeasures.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" exclaimed Herlock Sholmes, crushing the paper in his hands, \"that\nis only child's play! And that is the only criticism I have to make of\nArs\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin: he plays to the gallery. There is that much of the fakir\nin him.\"\n\n\"Ah! Sholmes, you are a wonderful man! You have such a command over your\ntemper. Nothing ever disturbs you.\"\n\n\"No, nothing disturbs me,\" replied Sholmes, in a voice that trembled\nfrom rage; \"besides, what's the use of losing my temper?... I am quite\nconfident of the final result; I shall have the last word.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nLIGHT IN THE DARKNESS.\n\n\nHowever well-tempered a man's character may be--and Herlock Sholmes is\none of those men over whom ill-fortune has little or no hold--there are\ncircumstances wherein the most courageous combatant feels the necessity\nof marshaling his forces before risking the chances of a battle.\n\n\"I shall take a vacation to-day,\" said Sholmes.\n\n\"And what shall I do?\" asked Wilson.\n\n\"You, Wilson--let me see! You can buy some underwear and linen to\nreplenish our wardrobe, while I take a rest.\"\n\n\"Very well, Sholmes, I will watch while you sleep.\"\n\nWilson uttered these words with all the importance of a sentinel on\nguard at the outpost, and therefore exposed to the greatest danger. His\nchest was expanded; his muscles were tense. Assuming a shrewd look, he\nscrutinized, officially, the little room in which they had fixed their\nabode.\n\n\"Very well, Wilson, you can watch. I shall occupy myself in the\npreparation of a line of attack more appropriate to the methods of the\nenemy we are called upon to meet. Do you see, Wilson, we have been\ndeceived in this fellow Lupin. My opinion is that we must commence at\nthe very beginning of this affair.\"\n\n\"And even before that, if possible. But have we sufficient time?\"\n\n\"Nine days, dear boy. That is five too many.\"\n\nThe Englishman spent the entire afternoon in smoking and sleeping. He\ndid not enter upon his new plan of attack until the following day. Then\nhe said:\n\n\"Wilson, I am ready. Let us attack the enemy.\"\n\n\"Lead on, Macduff!\" exclaimed Wilson, full of martial ardor. \"I wish to\nfight in the front rank. Oh! have no fear. I shall do credit to my King\nand country, for I am an Englishman.\"\n\nIn the first place, Sholmes had three long and important interviews:\nWith Monsieur Detinan, whose rooms he examined with the greatest care\nand precision; with Suzanne Gerbois, whom he questioned in regard to the\nblonde Lady; and with Sister Auguste, who had retired to the convent of\nthe Visitandines since the murder of Baron d'Hautrec.\n\nAt each of these interviews Wilson had remained outside; and each time\nhe asked:\n\n\"Satisfactory?\"\n\n\"Quite so.\"\n\n\"I was sure we were on the right track.\"\n\nThey paid a visit to the two houses adjoining that of the late Baron\nd'Hautrec in the avenue Henri-Martin; then they visited the rue\nClapeyron, and, while he was examining the front of number 25, Sholmes\nsaid:\n\n\"All these houses must be connected by secret passages, but I can't find\nthem.\"\n\nFor the first time in his life, Wilson doubted the omnipotence of his\nfamous associate. Why did he now talk so much and accomplish so little?\n\n\"Why?\" exclaimed Sholmes, in answer to Wilson's secret thought,\n\"because, with this fellow Lupin, a person has to work in the dark, and,\ninstead of deducting the truth from established facts, a man must\nextract it from his own brain, and afterward learn if it is supported by\nthe facts in the case.\"\n\n\"But what about the secret passages?\"\n\n\"They must exist. But even though I should discover them, and thus learn\nhow Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin made his entrance to the lawyer's house and how the\nblonde Lady escaped from the house of Baron d'Hautrec after the murder,\nwhat good would it do? How would it help me? Would it furnish me with a\nweapon of attack?\"\n\n\"Let us attack him just the same,\" exclaimed Wilson, who had scarcely\nuttered these words when he jumped back with a cry of alarm. Something\nhad fallen at their feet; it was a bag filled with sand which might have\ncaused them serious injury if it had struck them.\n\nSholmes looked up. Some men were working on a scaffolding attached to\nthe balcony at the fifth floor of the house. He said:\n\n\"We were lucky; one step more, and that heavy bag would have fallen on\nour heads. I wonder if--\"\n\nMoved by a sudden impulse, he rushed into the house, up the five flights\nof stairs, rang the bell, pushed his way into the apartment to the great\nsurprise and alarm of the servant who came to the door, and made his\nway to the balcony in front of the house. But there was no one there.\n\n\"Where are the workmen who were here a moment ago?\" he asked the\nservant.\n\n\"They have just gone.\"\n\n\"Which way did they go?\"\n\n\"By the servants' stairs.\"\n\nSholmes leaned out of the window. He saw two men leaving the house,\ncarrying bicycles. They mounted them and quickly disappeared around the\ncorner.\n\n\"How long have they been working on this scaffolding?\"\n\n\"Those men?... only since this morning. It's their first day.\"\n\nSholmes returned to the street, and joined Wilson. Together they\nreturned to the hotel, and thus the second day ended in a mournful\nsilence.\n\nOn the following day their programme was almost similar. They sat\ntogether on a bench in the avenue Henri-Martin, much to Wilson's\ndisgust, who did not find it amusing to spend long hours watching the\nhouse in which the tragedy had occurred.\n\n\"What do you expect, Sholmes? That Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin will walk out of the\nhouse?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"That the blonde Lady will make her appearance?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What then\/\"\n\n\"I am looking for something to occur; some slight incident that will\nfurnish me with a clue to work on.\"\n\n\"And if it does not occur!\"\n\n\"Then I must, myself, create the spark that will set fire to the\npowder.\"\n\nA solitary incident--and that of a disagreeable nature--broke the\nmonotony of the forenoon.\n\nA gentleman was riding along the avenue when his horse suddenly turned\naside in such a manner that it ran against the bench on which they were\nsitting, and struck Sholmes a slight blow on the shoulder.\n\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed Sholmes, \"a little more and I would have had a broken\nshoulder.\"\n\nThe gentleman struggled with his horse. The Englishman drew his revolver\nand pointed it; but Wilson seized his arm, and said:\n\n\"Don't be foolish! What are you going to do! Kill the man!\"\n\n\"Leave me alone, Wilson! Let go!\"\n\nDuring the brief struggle between Sholmes and Wilson the stranger rode\naway.\n\n\"Now, you can shoot,\" said Wilson, triumphantly, when the horseman was\nat some distance.\n\n\"Wilson, you're an idiot! Don't you understand that the man is an\naccomplice of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin?\"\n\nSholmes was trembling from rage. Wilson stammered pitifully:\n\n\"What!... that man ... an accomplice?\"\n\n\"Yes, the same as the workmen who tried to drop the bag of sand on us\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"It can't be possible!\"\n\n\"Possible or not, there was only one way to prove it.\"\n\n\"By killing the man?\"\n\n\"No--by killing the horse. If you hadn't grabbed my arm, I should have\ncaptured one of Lupin's accomplices. Now, do you understand the folly of\nyour act?\"\n\nThroughout the afternoon both men were morose. They did not speak a word\nto each other. At five o'clock they visited the rue Clapeyron, but were\ncareful to keep at a safe distance from the houses. However, three young\nmen who were passing through the street, arm in arm, singing, ran\nagainst Sholmes and Wilson and refused to let them pass. Sholmes, who\nwas in an ill humor, contested the right of way with them. After a brief\nstruggle, Sholmes resorted to his fists. He struck one of the men a hard\nblow on the chest, another a blow in the face, and thus subdued two of\nhis adversaries. Thereupon the three of them took to their heels and\ndisappeared.\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Sholmes, \"that does me good. I needed a little\nexercise.\"\n\nBut Wilson was leaning against the wall. Sholmes said:\n\n\"What's the matter, old chap? You're quite pale.\"\n\nWilson pointed to his left arm, which hung inert, and stammered:\n\n\"I don't know what it is. My arm pains me.\"\n\n\"Very much?... Is it serious?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am afraid so.\"\n\nHe tried to raise his arm, but it was helpless. Sholmes felt it, gently\nat first, then in a rougher way, \"to see how badly it was hurt,\" he\nsaid. He concluded that Wilson was really hurt, so he led him to a\nneighboring pharmacy, where a closer examination revealed the fact that\nthe arm was broken and that Wilson was a candidate for the hospital. In\nthe meantime they bared his arm and applied some remedies to ease his\nsuffering.\n\n\"Come, come, old chap, cheer up!\" said Sholmes, who was holding Wilson's\narm, \"in five or six weeks you will be all right again. But I will pay\nthem back ... the rascals! Especially Lupin, for this is his work ... no\ndoubt of that. I swear to you if ever----\"\n\nHe stopped suddenly, dropped the arm--which caused Wilson such an access\nof pain that he almost fainted--and, striking his forehead, Sholmes\nsaid:\n\n\"Wilson, I have an idea. You know, I have one occasionally.\"\n\nHe stood for a moment, silent, with staring eyes, and then muttered, in\nshort, sharp phrases:\n\n\"Yes, that's it ... that will explain all ... right at my feet ... and I\ndidn't see it ... ah, parbleu! I should have thought of it before....\nWilson, I shall have good news for you.\"\n\nAbruptly leaving his old friend, Sholmes ran into the street and went\ndirectly to the house known as number 25. On one of the stones, to the\nright of the door, he read this inscription: \"Destange, architect,\n1875.\"\n\nThere was a similar inscription on the house numbered 23.\n\nOf course, there was nothing unusual in that. But what might be read on\nthe houses in the avenue Henri-Martin?\n\nA carriage was passing. He engaged it and directed the driver to take\nhim to No. 134 avenue Henri-Martin. He was roused to a high pitch of\nexcitement. He stood up in the carriage and urged the horse to greater\nspeed. He offered extra pourboires to the driver. Quicker! Quicker!\n\nHow great was his anxiety as they turned from the rue de la Pompe! Had\nhe caught a glimpse of the truth at last?\n\nOn one of the stones of the late Baron's house he read the words:\n\"Destange, architect, 1874.\" And a similar inscription appeared on the\ntwo adjoining houses.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe reaction was such that he settled down in the seat of the carriage,\ntrembling from joy. At last, a tiny ray of light had penetrated the dark\nshadows which encompassed these mysterious crimes! In the vast sombre\nforest wherein a thousand pathways crossed and re-crossed, he had\ndiscovered the first clue to the track followed by the enemy!\n\nHe entered a branch postoffice and obtained telephonic connection with\nthe ch\u00c3\u00a2teau de Crozon. The Countess answered the telephone call.\n\n\"Hello!... Is that you, madame?\"\n\n\"Monsieur Sholmes, isn't it? Everything going all right?\"\n\n\"Quite well, but I wish to ask you one question.... Hello!\"\n\n\"Yes, I hear you.\"\n\n\"Tell me, when was the ch\u00c3\u00a2teau de Crozon built?\"\n\n\"It was destroyed by fire and rebuilt about thirty years ago.\"\n\n\"Who built it, and in what year?\"\n\n\"There is an inscription on the front of the house which reads: 'Lucien\nDestange, architect, 1877.'\"\n\n\"Thank you, madame, that is all. Good-bye.\"\n\nHe went away, murmuring: \"Destange ... Lucien Destange ... that name has\na familiar sound.\"\n\nHe noticed a public reading-room, entered, consulted a dictionary of\nmodern biography, and copied the following information: \"Lucien\nDestange, born 1840, Grand-Prix de Rome, officer of the Legion of Honor,\nauthor of several valuable books on architecture, etc....\"\n\nThen he returned to the pharmacy and found that Wilson had been taken to\nthe hospital. There Sholmes found him with his arm in splints, and\nshivering with fever.\n\n\"Victory! Victory!\" cried Sholmes. \"I hold one end of the thread.\"\n\n\"Of what thread?\"\n\n\"The one that leads to victory. I shall now be walking on solid ground,\nwhere there will be footprints, clues....\"\n\n\"Cigarette ashes?\" asked Wilson, whose curiosity had overcome his pain.\n\n\"And many other things! Just think, Wilson, I have found the mysterious\nlink which unites the different adventures in which the blonde Lady\nplayed a part. Why did Lupin select those three houses for the scenes of\nhis exploits?\"\n\n\"Yes, why?\"\n\n\"Because those three houses were built by the same architect. That was\nan easy problem, eh? Of course ... but who would have thought of it?\"\n\n\"No one but you.\"\n\n\"And who, except I, knows that the same architect, by the use of\nanalogous plans, has rendered it possible for a person to execute three\ndistinct acts which, though miraculous in appearance, are, in reality,\nquite simple and easy?\"\n\n\"That was a stroke of good luck.\"\n\n\"And it was time, dear boy, as I was becoming very impatient. You know,\nthis is our fourth day.\"\n\n\"Out of ten.\"\n\n\"Oh! after this----\"\n\nSholmes was excited, delighted, and gayer than usual.\n\n\"And when I think that these rascals might have attacked me in the\nstreet and broken my arm just as they did yours! Isn't that so, Wilson?\"\n\nWilson simply shivered at the horrible thought. Sholmes continued:\n\n\"We must profit by the lesson. I can see, Wilson, that we were wrong to\ntry and fight Lupin in the open, and leave ourselves exposed to his\nattacks.\"\n\n\"I can see it, and feel it, too, in my broken arm,\" said Wilson.\n\n\"You have one consolation, Wilson; that is, that I escaped. Now, I must\nbe doubly cautious. In an open fight he will defeat me; but if I can\nwork in the dark, unseen by him, I have the advantage, no matter how\nstrong his forces may be.\"\n\n\"Ganimard might be of some assistance.\"\n\n\"Never! On the day that I can truly say: Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin is there; I show\nyou the quarry, and how to catch it; I shall go and see Ganimard at one\nof the two addresses that he gave me--his residence in the rue\nPergolese, or at the Suisse tavern in the Place du Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet. But, until\nthat time, I shall work alone.\"\n\nHe approached the bed, placed his hand on Wilson's shoulder--on the sore\none, of course--and said to him:\n\n\"Take care of yourself, old fellow. Henceforth your r\u00c3\u00b4le will be to keep\ntwo or three of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin's men busy watching here in vain for my\nreturn to enquire about your health. It is a secret mission for you,\neh?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I shall do my best to fulfil it conscientiously. Then you do\nnot expect to come here any more?\"\n\n\"What for?\" asked Sholmes.\n\n\"I don't know ... of course.... I am getting on as well as possible.\nBut, Herlock, do me a last service: give me a drink.\"\n\n\"A drink?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am dying of thirst; and with my fever----\"\n\n\"To be sure--directly----\"\n\nHe made a pretense of getting some water, perceived a package of\ntobacco, lighted his pipe, and then, as if he had not heard his friend's\nrequest, he went away, whilst Wilson uttered a mute prayer for the\ninaccessible water.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Monsieur Destange!\"\n\nThe servant eyed from head to foot the person to whom he had opened the\ndoor of the house--the magnificent house that stood at the corner of the\nPlace Malesherbes and the rue Montchanin--and at the sight of the man\nwith gray hairs, badly shaved, dressed in a shabby black coat, with a\nbody as ill-formed and ungracious as his face, he replied with the\ndisdain which he thought the occasion warranted:\n\n\"Monsieur Destange may or may not be at home. That depends. Has monsieur\na card?\"\n\nMonsieur did not have a card, but he had a letter of introduction and,\nafter the servant had taken the letter to Mon. Destange, he was\nconducted into the presence of that gentleman who was sitting in a large\ncircular room or rotunda which occupied one of the wings of the house.\nIt was a library, and contained a profusion of books and architectural\ndrawings. When the stranger entered, the architect said to him:\n\n\"You are Monsieur Stickmann?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"My secretary tells me that he is ill, and has sent you to continue the\ngeneral catalogue of the books which he commenced under my direction,\nand, more particularly, the catalogue of German books. Are you familiar\nwith that kind of work?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, quite so,\" he replied, with a strong German accent.\n\nUnder those circumstances the bargain was soon concluded, and Mon.\nDestange commenced work with his new secretary.\n\nHerlock Sholmes had gained access to the house.\n\nIn order to escape the vigilance of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin and gain admittance to\nthe house occupied by Lucien Destange and his daughter Clotilde, the\nfamous detective had been compelled to resort to a number of\nstratagems, and, under a variety of names, to ingratiate himself into\nthe good graces and confidence of a number of persons--in short, to\nlive, during forty-eight hours, a most complicated life. During that\ntime he had acquired the following information: Mon. Destange, having\nretired from active business on account of his failing health, now lived\namongst the many books he had accumulated on the subject of\narchitecture. He derived infinite pleasure in viewing and handling those\ndusty old volumes.\n\nHis daughter Clotilde was considered eccentric. She passed her time in\nanother part of the house, and never went out.\n\n\"Of course,\" Sholmes said to himself, as he wrote in a register the\ntitles of the books which Mon. Destange dictated to him, \"all that is\nvague and incomplete, but it is quite a long step in advance. I shall\nsurely solve one of these absorbing problems: Is Mon. Destange\nassociated with Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin? Does he continue to see him? Are the\npapers relating to the construction of the three houses still in\nexistence? Will those papers not furnish me with the location of other\nhouses of similar construction which Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin and his associates\nwill plunder in the future?\n\n\"Monsieur Destange, an accomplice of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin! That venerable man,\nan officer of the Legion of Honor, working in league with a\nburglar--such an idea was absurd! Besides, if we concede that such a\ncomplicity exists, how could Mon. Destange, thirty years ago, have\npossibly foreseen the thefts of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin, who was then an infant?\"\n\nNo matter! The Englishman was implacable. With his marvellous scent, and\nthat instinct which never fails him, he felt that he was in the heart of\nsome strange mystery. Ever since he first entered the house, he had been\nunder the influence of that impression, and yet he could not define the\ngrounds on which he based his suspicions.\n\nUp to the morning of the second day he had not made any significant\ndiscovery. At two o'clock of that day he saw Clotilde Destange for the\nfirst time; she came to the library in search of a book. She was about\nthirty years of age, a brunette, slow and silent in her movements, with\nfeatures imbued with that expression of indifference which is\ncharacteristic of people who live a secluded life. She exchanged a few\nwords with her father, and then retired, without even looking at\nSholmes.\n\nThe afternoon dragged along monotonously. At five o'clock Mon. Destange\nannounced his intention to go out. Sholmes was alone on the circular\ngallery that was constructed about ten feet above the floor of the\nrotunda. It was almost dark. He was on the point of going out, when he\nheard a slight sound and, at the same time, experienced the feeling that\nthere was someone in the room. Several minutes passed before he saw or\nheard anything more. Then he shuddered; a shadowy form emerged from the\ngloom, quite close to him, upon the balcony. It seemed incredible. How\nlong had this mysterious visitor been there? Whence did he come?\n\nThe strange man descended the steps and went directly to a large oaken\ncupboard. Sholmes was a keen observer of the man's movements. He watched\nhim searching amongst the papers with which the cupboard was filled.\nWhat was he looking for?\n\nThen the door opened and Mlle. Destange entered, speaking to someone who\nwas following her:\n\n\"So you have decided not to go out, father?... Then I will make a light\n... one second ... do not move....\"\n\nThe strange man closed the cupboard and hid in the embrasure of a large\nwindow, drawing the curtains together. Did Mlle. Destange not see him?\nDid she not hear him? Calmly she turned on the electric lights; she and\nher father sat down close to each other. She opened a book she had\nbrought with her, and commenced to read. After the lapse of a few\nminutes she said:\n\n\"Your secretary has gone.\"\n\n\"Yes, I don't see him.\"\n\n\"Do you like him as well as you did at first?\" she asked, as if she were\nnot aware of the illness of the real secretary and his replacement by\nStickmann.\n\n\"Oh! yes.\"\n\nMonsieur Destange's head bobbed from one side to the other. He was\nasleep. The girl resumed her reading. A moment later one of the window\ncurtains was pushed back, and the strange man emerged and glided along\nthe wall toward the door, which obliged him to pass behind Mon. Destange\nbut in front of Clotilde, and brought him into the light so that\nHerlock Sholmes obtained a good view of the man's face. It was Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne\nLupin.\n\nThe Englishman was delighted. His forecast was verified; he had\npenetrated to the very heart of the mystery, and found Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin to\nbe the moving spirit in it.\n\nClotilde had not yet displayed any knowledge of his presence, although\nit was quite improbable that any movement of the intruder had escaped\nher notice. Lupin had almost reached the door and, in fact, his hand was\nalready seeking the door-knob, when his coat brushed against a small\ntable and knocked something to the floor. Monsieur Destange awoke with a\nstart. Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin was already standing in front of him, hat in hand,\nsmiling.\n\n\"Maxime Bermond,\" exclaimed Mon. Destange, joyfully. \"My dear Maxime,\nwhat lucky chance brings you here?\"\n\n\"The wish to see you and Mademoiselle Destange.\"\n\n\"When did you return from your journey?\"\n\n\"Yesterday.\"\n\n\"You must stay to dinner.\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I am sorry, but I have an appointment to dine with some\nfriends at a restaurant.\"\n\n\"Come, to-morrow, then, Clotilde, you must urge him to come to-morrow.\nAh! my dear Maxime.... I thought of you many times during your absence.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Yes, I went through all my old papers in that cupboard, and found our\nlast statement of account.\"\n\n\"What account?\"\n\n\"Relating to the avenue Henri-Martin.\"\n\n\"Ah! do you keep such papers? What for?\"\n\nThen the three of them left the room, and continued their conversation\nin a small parlor which adjoined the library.\n\n\"Is it Lupin?\" Sholmes asked himself, in a sudden access of doubt.\nCertainly, from all appearances, it was he; and yet it was also someone\nelse who resembled Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin in certain respects, and who still\nmaintained his own individuality, features, and color of hair. Sholmes\ncould hear Lupin's voice in the adjoining room. He was relating some\nstories at which Mon. Destange laughed heartily, and which even brought\na smile to the lips of the melancholy Clotilde. And each of those\nsmiles appeared to be the reward which Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin was seeking, and\nwhich he was delighted to have secured. His success caused him to\nredouble his efforts and, insensibly, at the sound of that clear and\nhappy voice, Clotilde's face brightened and lost that cold and listless\nexpression which usually pervaded it.\n\n\"They love each other,\" thought Sholmes, \"but what the deuce can there\nbe in common between Clotilde Destange and Maxime Bermond? Does she know\nthat Maxime is none other than Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin?\"\n\nUntil seven o'clock Sholmes was an anxious listener, seeking to profit\nby the conversation. Then, with infinite precaution, he descended from\nthe gallery, crept along the side of the room to the door in such a\nmanner that the people in the adjoining room did not see him.\n\nWhen he reached the street Sholmes satisfied himself that there was\nneither an automobile nor a cab waiting there; then he slowly limped\nalong the boulevard Malesherbes. He turned into an adjacent street,\ndonned the overcoat which he had carried on his arm, altered the shape\nof his hat, assumed an upright carriage, and, thus transformed,\nreturned to a place whence he could watch the door of Mon. Destange's\nhouse.\n\nIn a few minutes Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin came out, and proceeded to walk toward the\ncenter of Paris by way of the rues de Constantinople and London. Herlock\nSholmes followed at a distance of a hundred paces.\n\nExciting moments for the Englishman! He sniffed the air, eagerly, like a\nhound following a fresh scent. It seemed to him a delightful thing thus\nto follow his adversary. It was no longer Herlock Sholmes who was being\nwatched, but Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin, the invisible Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin. He held him, so\nto speak, within the grasp of his eye, by an imperceptible bond that\nnothing could break. And he was pleased to think that the quarry\nbelonged to him.\n\nBut he soon observed a suspicious circumstance. In the intervening space\nbetween him and Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin he noticed several people traveling in the\nsame direction, particularly two husky fellows in slouch hats on the\nleft side of the street, and two others on the right wearing caps and\nsmoking cigarettes. Of course, their presence in that vicinity may have\nbeen the result of chance, but Sholmes was more astonished when he\nobserved that the four men stopped when Lupin entered a tobacco shop;\nand still more surprised when the four men started again after Lupin\nemerged from the shop, each keeping to his own side of the street.\n\n\"Curse it!\" muttered Sholmes; \"he is being followed.\"\n\nHe was annoyed at the idea that others were on the trail of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne\nLupin; that someone might deprive him, not of the glory--he cared little\nfor that--but of the immense pleasure of capturing, single-handed, the\nmost formidable enemy he had ever met. And he felt that he was not\nmistaken; the men presented to Sholmes' experienced eye the appearance\nand manner of those who, while regulating their gait to that of another,\nwish to present a careless and natural air.\n\n\"Is this some of Ganimard's work?\" muttered Sholmes. \"Is he playing me\nfalse?\"\n\nHe felt inclined to speak to one of the men with a view of acting in\nconcert with him; but as they were now approaching the boulevard the\ncrowd was becoming denser, and he was afraid he might lose sight of\nLupin. So he quickened his pace and turned into the boulevard just in\ntime to see Lupin ascending the steps of the Hungarian restaurant at the\ncorner of the rue du Helder. The door of the restaurant was open, so\nthat Sholmes, while sitting on a bench on the other side of the\nboulevard, could see Lupin take a seat at a table, luxuriously appointed\nand decorated with flowers, at which three gentlemen and two ladies of\nelegant appearance were already seated and who extended to Lupin a\nhearty greeting.\n\nSholmes now looked about for the four men and perceived them amongst a\ncrowd of people who were listening to a gipsy orchestra that was playing\nin a neighboring caf\u00c3\u00a9. It was a curious thing that they were paying no\nattention to Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin, but seemed to be friendly with the people\naround them. One of them took a cigarette from his pocket and approached\na gentleman who wore a frock coat and silk hat. The gentleman offered\nthe other his cigar for a light, and Sholmes had the impression that\nthey talked to each other much longer than the occasion demanded.\nFinally the gentleman approached the Hungarian restaurant, entered and\nlooked around. When he caught sight of Lupin he advanced and spoke to\nhim for a moment, then took a seat at an adjoining table. Sholmes now\nrecognized this gentleman as the horseman who had tried to run him down\nin the avenue Henri-Martin.\n\nThen Sholmes understood that these men were not tracking Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin;\nthey were a part of his band. They were watching over his safety. They\nwere his bodyguard, his satellites, his vigilant escort. Wherever danger\nthreatened Lupin, these confederates were at hand to avert it, ready to\ndefend him. The four men were accomplices. The gentleman in the frock\ncoat was an accomplice. These facts furnished the Englishman with food\nfor reflection. Would he ever succeed in capturing that inaccessible\nindividual? What unlimited power was possessed by such an organization,\ndirected by such a chief!\n\nHe tore a leaf from his notebook, wrote a few lines in pencil, which he\nplaced in an envelope, and said to a boy about fifteen years of age who\nwas sitting on the bench beside him:\n\n\"Here, my boy; take a carriage and deliver this letter to the cashier of\nthe Suisse tavern, Place du Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet. Be quick!\"\n\nHe gave him a five-franc piece. The boy disappeared.\n\nA half hour passed away. The crowd had grown larger, and Sholmes\nperceived only at intervals the accomplices of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin. Then\nsomeone brushed against him and whispered in his ear:\n\n\"Well? what is it, Monsieur Sholmes?\"\n\n\"Ah! it is you, Ganimard?\"\n\n\"Yes; I received your note at the tavern. What's the matter?\"\n\n\"He is there.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"There ... in the restaurant. Lean to the right.... Do you see him now?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"He is pouring a glass of champagne for the lady.\"\n\n\"That is not Lupin.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is.\"\n\n\"But I tell you.... Ah! yet, it may be. It looks a great deal like him,\"\nsaid Ganimard, naively. \"And the others--accomplices?\"\n\n\"No; the lady sitting beside him is Lady Cliveden; the other is the\nDuchess de Cleath. The gentleman sitting opposite Lupin is the Spanish\nAmbassador to London.\"\n\nGanimard took a step forward. Sholmes retained him.\n\n\"Be prudent. You are alone.\"\n\n\"So is he.\"\n\n\"No, he has a number of men on the boulevard mounting guard. And inside\nthe restaurant that gentleman----\"\n\n\"And I, when I take Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin by the collar and announce his name, I\nshall have the entire room on my side and all the waiters.\"\n\n\"I should prefer to have a few policemen.\"\n\n\"But, Monsieur Sholmes, we have no choice. We must catch him when we\ncan.\"\n\nHe was right; Sholmes knew it. It was better to take advantage of the\nopportunity and make the attempt. Sholmes simply gave this advice to\nGanimard:\n\n\"Conceal your identity as long as possible.\"\n\nSholmes glided behind a newspaper kiosk, whence he could still watch\nLupin, who was leaning toward Lady Cliveden, talking and smiling.\n\nGanimard crossed the street, hands in his pockets, as if he were going\ndown the boulevard, but when he reached the opposite sidewalk he turned\nquickly and bounded up the steps of the restaurant. There was a shrill\nwhistle. Ganimard ran against the head waiter, who had suddenly planted\nhimself in the doorway and now pushed Ganimard back with a show of\nindignation, as if he were an intruder whose presence would bring\ndisgrace upon the restaurant. Ganimard was surprised. At the same moment\nthe gentleman in the frock coat came out. He took the part of the\ndetective and entered into an exciting argument with the waiter; both of\nthem hung on to Ganimard, one pushing him in, the other pushing him out\nin such a manner that, despite all his efforts and despite his furious\nprotestations, the unfortunate detective soon found himself on the\nsidewalk.\n\nThe struggling men were surrounded by a crowd. Two policemen, attracted\nby the noise, tried to force their way through the crowd, but\nencountered a mysterious resistance and could make no headway through\nthe opposing backs and pressing shoulders of the mob.\n\nBut suddenly, as if by magic, the crowd parted and the passage to the\nrestaurant was clear. The head waiter, recognizing his mistake, was\nprofuse in his apologies; the gentleman in the frock coat ceased his\nefforts on behalf of the detective, the crowd dispersed, the policemen\npassed on, and Ganimard hastened to the table at which the six guests\nwere sitting. But now there were only five! He looked around.... The\nonly exit was the door.\n\n\"The person who was sitting here!\" he cried to the five astonished\nguests. \"Where is he?\"\n\n\"Monsieur Destro?\"\n\n\"No; Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin!\"\n\nA waiter approached and said:\n\n\"The gentleman went upstairs.\"\n\nGanimard rushed up in the hope of finding him. The upper floor of the\nrestaurant contained private dining-rooms and had a private stairway\nleading to the boulevard.\n\n\"No use looking for him now,\" muttered Ganimard. \"He is far away by this\ntime.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was not far away--two hundred yards at most--in the\nMadeleine-Bastille omnibus, which was rolling along very peacefully with\nits three horses across the Place de l'Op\u00c3\u00a9ra toward the Boulevard des\nCapucines. Two sturdy fellows were talking together on the platform. On\nthe roof of the omnibus near the stairs an old fellow was sleeping; it\nwas Herlock Sholmes.\n\nWith bobbing head, rocked by the movement of the vehicle, the Englishman\nsaid to himself:\n\n\"If Wilson could see me now, how proud he would be of his\ncollaborator!... Bah! It was easy to foresee that the game was lost, as\nsoon as the man whistled; nothing could be done but watch the exits and\nsee that our man did not escape. Really, Lupin makes life exciting and\ninteresting.\"\n\nAt the terminal point Herlock Sholmes, by leaning over, saw Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin\nleaving the omnibus, and as he passed in front of the men who formed his\nbodyguard Sholmes heard him say: \"A l'Etoile.\"\n\n\"A l'Etoile, exactly, a rendezvous. I shall be there,\" thought Sholmes.\n\"I will follow the two men.\"\n\nLupin took an automobile; but the men walked the entire distance,\nfollowed by Sholmes. They stopped at a narrow house, No. 40 rue\nChalgrin, and rang the bell. Sholmes took his position in the shadow of\na doorway, whence he could watch the house in question. A man opened one\nof the windows of the ground floor and closed the shutters. But the\nshutters did not reach to the top of the window. The impost was clear.\n\nAt the end of ten minutes a gentleman rang at the same door and a few\nminutes later another man came. A short time afterward an automobile\nstopped in front of the house, bringing two passengers: Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin and\na lady concealed beneath a large cloak and a thick veil.\n\n\"The blonde Lady, no doubt,\" said Sholmes to himself, as the automobile\ndrove away.\n\nHerlock Sholmes now approached the house, climbed to the window-ledge\nand, by standing on tiptoe, he was able to see through the window above\nthe shutters. What did he see?\n\nArs\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin, leaning against the mantel, was speaking with considerable\nanimation. The others were grouped around him, listening to him\nattentively. Amongst them Sholmes easily recognized the gentleman in the\nfrock coat and he thought one of the other men resembled the head-waiter\nof the restaurant. As to the blonde Lady, she was seated in an armchair\nwith her back to the window.\n\n\"They are holding a consultation,\" thought Sholmes. \"They are worried\nover the incident at the restaurant and are holding a council of war.\nAh! what a master stroke it would be to capture all of them at one fell\nstroke!\"\n\nOne of them, having moved toward the door, Sholmes leaped to the ground\nand concealed himself in the shadow. The gentleman in the frock coat and\nthe head-waiter left the house. A moment later a light appeared at the\nwindows of the first floor, but the shutters were closed immediately and\nthe upper part of the house was dark as well as the lower.\n\n\"Lupin and the woman are on the ground floor; the two confederates live\non the upper floor,\" said Sholmes.\n\nSholmes remained there the greater part of the night, fearing that if he\nwent away Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin might leave during his absence. At four o'clock,\nseeing two policemen at the end of the street, he approached them,\nexplained the situation and left them to watch the house. He went to\nGanimard's residence in the rue Pergolese and wakened him.\n\n\"I have him yet,\" said Sholmes.\n\n\"Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"If you haven't got any better hold on him than you had a while ago, I\nmight as well go back to bed. But we may as well go to the\nstation-house.\"\n\nThey went to the police station in the rue Mesnil and from there to the\nresidence of the commissary, Mon. Decointre. Then, accompanied by half a\ndozen policemen, they went to the rue Chalgrin.\n\n\"Anything new?\" asked Sholmes, addressing the two policemen.\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nIt was just breaking day when, after taking necessary measures to\nprevent escape, the commissary rang the bell and commenced to question\nthe concierge. The woman was greatly frightened at this early morning\ninvasion, and she trembled as she replied that there were no tenants on\nthe ground floor.\n\n\"What! not a tenant?\" exclaimed Ganimard.\n\n\"No; but on the first floor there are two men named Leroux. They have\nfurnished the apartment on the ground floor for some country relations.\"\n\n\"A gentleman and lady.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Who came here last night.\"\n\n\"Perhaps ... but I don't know ... I was asleep. But I don't think so,\nfor the key is here. They did not ask for it.\"\n\nWith that key the commissary opened the door of the ground-floor\napartment. It comprised only two rooms and they were empty.\n\n\"Impossible!\" exclaimed Sholmes. \"I saw both of them in this room.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt your word,\" said the commissary; \"but they are not here\nnow.\"\n\n\"Let us go to the first floor. They must be there.\"\n\n\"The first floor is occupied by two men named Leroux.\"\n\n\"We will examine the Messieurs Leroux.\"\n\nThey all ascended the stairs and the commissary rang. At the second ring\na man opened the door; he was in his shirt-sleeves. Sholmes recognized\nhim as one of Lupin's bodyguard. The man assumed a furious air:\n\n\"What do you mean by making such a row at this hour of the morning ...\nwaking people up....\"\n\nBut he stopped suddenly, astounded.\n\n\"God forgive me!... really, gentlemen, I didn't notice who it was. Why,\nit is Monsieur Decointre!... and you, Monsieur Ganimard. What can I do\nfor you!\"\n\nGanimard burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter, which caused him\nto bend double and turn black in the face.\n\n\"Ah! it is you, Leroux,\" he stammered. \"Oh! this is too funny! Leroux,\nan accomplice of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin! Oh, I shall die! and your brother,\nLeroux, where is he?\"\n\n\"Edmond!\" called the man. \"It is Ganimard, who has come to visit us.\"\n\nAnother man appeared and at sight of him Ganimard's mirth redoubled.\n\n\"Oh! oh! we had no idea of this! Ah! my friends, you are in a bad fix\nnow. Who would have ever suspected it?\"\n\nTurning to Sholmes, Ganimard introduced the man:\n\n\"Victor Leroux, a detective from our office, one of the best men in the\niron brigade ... Edmond Leroux, chief clerk in the anthropometric\nservice.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nAN ABDUCTION.\n\n\nHerlock Sholmes said nothing. To protest? To accuse the two men? That\nwould be useless. In the absence of evidence which he did not possess\nand had no time to seek, no one would believe him. Moreover, he was\nstifled with rage, but would not display his feelings before the\ntriumphant Ganimard. So he bowed respectfully to the brothers Leroux,\nguardians of society, and retired.\n\nIn the vestibule he turned toward a low door which looked like the\nentrance to a cellar, and picked up a small red stone; it was a garnet.\nWhen he reached the street he turned and read on the front of the house\nthis inscription: \"Lucien Destange, architect, 1877.\"\n\nThe adjoining house, No. 42, bore the same inscription.\n\n\"Always the double passage--numbers 40 and 42 have a secret means of\ncommunication. Why didn't I think of that? I should have remained with\nthe two policemen.\"\n\nHe met the policemen near the corner and said to them:\n\n\"Two people came out of house No. 42 during my absence, didn't they?\"\n\n\"Yes; a gentleman and lady.\"\n\nGanimard approached. Sholmes took his arm, and as they walked down the\nstreet he said:\n\n\"Monsieur Ganimard, you have had a good laugh and will no doubt forgive\nme for the trouble I have caused you.\"\n\n\"Oh! there's no harm done; but it was a good joke.\"\n\n\"I admit that; but the best jokes have only a short life, and this one\ncan't last much longer.\"\n\n\"I hope not.\"\n\n\"This is now the seventh day, and I can remain only three days more.\nThen I must return to London.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"I wish to ask you to be in readiness, as I may call on you at any hour\non Tuesday or Wednesday night.\"\n\n\"For an expedition of the same kind as we had to-night?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, the very same.\"\n\n\"With what result?\"\n\n\"The capture of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin,\" replied Sholmes.\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"I swear it, on my honor, monsieur.\"\n\nSholmes bade Ganimard good-bye and went to the nearest hotel for a few\nhours' sleep; after which, refreshed and with renewed confidence in\nhimself, he returned to the rue Chalgrin, slipped two louis into the\nhand of the concierge, assured himself that the brothers Leroux had gone\nout, learned that the house belonged to a Monsieur Harmingeat, and,\nprovided with a candle, descended to the cellar through the low door\nnear which he had found the garnet. At the bottom of the stairs he found\nanother exactly like it.\n\n\"I am not mistaken,\" he thought; \"this is the means of communication.\nLet me see if my skeleton-key will open the cellar reserved for the\ntenant of the ground floor. Yes; it will. Now, I will examine those\ncases of wine... oh! oh! here are some places where the dust has been\ncleared away ... and some footprints on the ground....\"\n\nA slight noise caused him to listen attentively. Quickly he pushed the\ndoor shut, blew out his candle and hid behind a pile of empty wine\ncases. After a few seconds he noticed that a portion of the wall swung\non a pivot, the light of a lantern was thrown into the cellar, an arm\nappeared, then a man entered.\n\nHe was bent over, as if he were searching for something. He felt in the\ndust with his fingers and several times he threw something into a\ncardboard box that he carried in his left hand. Afterward he obliterated\nthe traces of his footsteps, as well as the footprints left by Lupin and\nthe blonde lady, and he was about to leave the cellar by the same way as\nhe had entered, when he uttered a harsh cry and fell to the ground.\nSholmes had leaped upon him. It was the work of a moment, and in the\nsimplest manner in the world the man found himself stretched on the\nground, bound and handcuffed. The Englishman leaned over him and said:\n\n\"Have you anything to say?... To tell what you know?\"\n\nThe man replied by such an ironical smile that Sholmes realized the\nfutility of questioning him. So he contented himself by exploring the\npockets of his captive, but he found only a bunch of keys, a\nhandkerchief and the small cardboard box which contained a dozen\ngarnets similar to those which Sholmes had found.\n\nThen what was he to do with the man? Wait until his friends came to his\nhelp and deliver all of them to the police? What good would that do?\nWhat advantage would that give him over Lupin?\n\nHe hesitated; but an examination of the box decided the question. The\nbox bore this name and address: \"Leonard, jeweler, rue de la Paix.\"\n\nHe resolved to abandon the man to his fate. He locked the cellar and\nleft the house. At a branch postoffice he sent a telegram to Monsieur\nDestange, saying that he could not come that day. Then he went to see\nthe jeweler and, handing him the garnets, said:\n\n\"Madame sent me with these stones. She wishes to have them reset.\"\n\nSholmes had struck the right key. The jeweler replied:\n\n\"Certainly; the lady telephoned to me. She said she would be here\nto-day.\"\n\nSholmes established himself on the sidewalk to wait for the lady, but it\nwas five o'clock when he saw a heavily-veiled lady approach and enter\nthe store. Through the window he saw her place on the counter a piece\nof antique jewelry set with garnets.\n\nShe went away almost immediately, walking quickly and passed through\nstreets that were unknown to the Englishman. As it was now almost dark,\nhe walked close behind her and followed her into a five-story house of\ndouble flats and, therefore, occupied by numerous tenants. At the second\nfloor she stopped and entered. Two minutes later the Englishman\ncommenced to try the keys on the bunch he had taken from the man in the\nrue Chalgrin. The fourth key fitted the lock.\n\nNotwithstanding the darkness of the rooms, he perceived that they were\nabsolutely empty, as if unoccupied, and the various doors were standing\nopen so that he could see all the apartments. At the end of a corridor\nhe perceived a ray of light and, by approaching on tiptoe and looking\nthrough the glass door, he saw the veiled lady who had removed her hat\nand dress and was now wearing a velvet dressing-gown. The discarded\ngarments were lying on the only chair in the room and a lighted lamp\nstood on the mantel.\n\nThen he saw her approach the fireplace and press what appeared to be the\nbutton of an electric bell. Immediately the panel to the right of the\nfireplace moved and slowly glided behind the adjoining panel, thus\ndisclosing an opening large enough for a person to pass through. The\nlady disappeared through this opening, taking the lamp with her.\n\nThe operation was a very simple one. Sholmes adopted it and followed the\nlady. He found himself in total darkness and immediately he felt his\nface brushed by some soft articles. He lighted a match and found that he\nwas in a very small room completely filled with cloaks and dresses\nsuspended on hangers. He picked his way through until he reached a door\nthat was draped with a portiere. He peeped through and, behold, the\nblonde lady was there, under his eyes, and almost within reach of his\nhand.\n\nShe extinguished the lamp and turned on the electric lights. Then for\nthe first time Herlock Sholmes obtained a good look at her face. He was\namazed. The woman, whom he had overtaken after so much trouble and after\nso many tricks and manoeuvres, was none other than Clotilde Destange.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nClotilde Destange, the assassin of the Baron d'Hautrec and the thief who\nstole the blue diamond! Clotilde Destange, the mysterious friend of\nArs\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin! And the blonde lady!\n\n\"Yes, I am only a stupid ass,\" thought Herlock Sholmes at that moment.\n\"Because Lupin's friend was a blonde and Clotilde is a brunette, I never\ndreamed that they were the same person. But how could the blonde lady\nremain a blonde after the murder of the baron and the theft of the\ndiamond?\"\n\nSholmes could see a portion of the room; it was a boudoir, furnished\nwith the most delightful luxury and exquisite taste, and adorned with\nbeautiful tapestries and costly ornaments. A mahogany couch, upholstered\nin silk, was located on the side of the room opposite the door at which\nSholmes was standing. Clotilde was sitting on this couch, motionless,\nher face covered by her hands. Then he perceived that she was weeping.\nGreat tears rolled down her pale cheeks and fell, drop by drop, on the\nvelvet corsage. The tears came thick and fast, as if their source were\ninexhaustible.\n\nA door silently opened behind her and Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin entered. He looked at\nher for a long time without making his presence known; then he\napproached her, knelt at her feet, pressed her head to his breast,\nfolded her in his arms, and his actions indicated an infinite measure\nof love and sympathy. For a time not a word was uttered, but her tears\nbecame less abundant.\n\n\"I was so anxious to make you happy,\" he murmured.\n\n\"I am happy.\"\n\n\"No; you are crying.... Your tears break my heart, Clotilde.\"\n\nThe caressing and sympathetic tone of his voice soothed her, and she\nlistened to him with an eager desire for hope and happiness. Her\nfeatures were softened by a smile, and yet how sad a smile! He continued\nto speak in a tone of tender entreaty:\n\n\"You should not be unhappy, Clotilde; you have no cause to be.\"\n\nShe displayed her delicate white hands and said, solemnly:\n\n\"Yes, Maxime; so long as I see those hands I shall be sad.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"They are stained with blood.\"\n\n\"Hush! Do not think of that!\" exclaimed Lupin. \"The dead is past and\ngone. Do not resurrect it.\"\n\nAnd he kissed the long, delicate hand, while she regarded him with a\nbrighter smile as if each kiss effaced a portion of that dreadful\nmemory.\n\n\"You must love me, Maxime; you must--because no woman will ever love you\nas I do. For your sake, I have done many things, not at your order or\nrequest, but in obedience to your secret desires. I have done things at\nwhich my will and conscience revolted, but there was some unknown power\nthat I could not resist. What I did I did involuntarily, mechanically,\nbecause it helped you, because you wished it ... and I am ready to do it\nagain to-morrow ... and always.\"\n\n\"Ah, Clotilde,\" he said, bitterly, \"why did I draw you into my\nadventurous life? I should have remained the Maxime Bermond that you\nloved five years ago, and not have let you know the ... other man that I\nam.\"\n\nShe replied in a low voice:\n\n\"I love the other man, also, and I have nothing to regret.\"\n\n\"Yes, you regret your past life--the free and happy life you once\nenjoyed.\"\n\n\"I have no regrets when you are here,\" she said, passionately. \"All\nfaults and crimes disappear when I see you. When you are away I may\nsuffer, and weep, and be horrified at what I have done; but when you\ncome it is all forgotten. Your love wipes it all away. And I am happy\nagain.... But you must love me!\"\n\n\"I do not love you on compulsion, Clotilde. I love you simply because\n... I love you.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of it?\"\n\n\"I am just as sure of my own love as I am of yours. Only my life is a\nvery active and exciting one, and I cannot spend as much time with you\nas I would like--just now.\"\n\n\"What is it? Some new danger? Tell me!\"\n\n\"Oh! nothing serious. Only....\"\n\n\"Only what?\" she asked.\n\n\"Well, he is on our track.\"\n\n\"Who? Herlock Sholmes?\"\n\n\"Yes; it was he who dragged Ganimard into that affair at the Hungarian\nrestaurant. It was he who instructed the two policemen to watch the\nhouse in the rue Chalgrin. I have proof of it. Ganimard searched the\nhouse this morning and Sholmes was with him. Besides----\"\n\n\"Besides? What?\"\n\n\"Well, there is another thing. One of our men is missing.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Jeanniot.\"\n\n\"The concierge?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why, I sent him to the rue Chalgrin this morning to pick up the garnets\nthat fell out of my brooch.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt, then, that Sholmes caught him.\"\n\n\"No; the garnets were delivered to the jeweler in the rue de la Paix.\"\n\n\"Then, what has become of him!\"\n\n\"Oh! Maxime, I am afraid.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to be afraid of, but I confess the situation is very\nserious. What does he know? Where does he hide himself? His isolation is\nhis strong card. I cannot reach him.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"Act with extreme prudence, Clotilde. Some time ago I decided to change\nmy residence to a safer place, and Sholmes' appearance on the scene has\nprompted me to do so at once. When a man like that is on your track, you\nmust be prepared for the worst. Well, I am making my preparations. Day\nafter to-morrow, Wednesday, I shall move. At noon it will be finished.\nAt two o'clock I shall leave the place, after removing the last trace\nof our residence there, which will be no small matter. Until then----\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Until then we must not see each other and no one must see you,\nClotilde. Do not go out. I have no fear for myself, but I have for you.\"\n\n\"That Englishman cannot possibly reach me.\"\n\n\"I am not so sure of that. He is a dangerous man. Yesterday I came here\nto search the cupboard that contains all of Monsieur Destange's old\npapers and records. There is danger there. There is danger everywhere. I\nfeel that he is watching us--that he is drawing his net around us closer\nand closer. It is one of those intuitions which never deceive me.\"\n\n\"In that case, Maxime, go, and think no more of my tears. I shall be\nbrave, and wait patiently until the danger is past. Adieu, Maxime.\"\n\nThey held one another for some time in a last fond embrace. And it was\nshe that gently pushed him outside. Sholmes could hear the sound of\ntheir voices in the distance.\n\nEmboldened by the necessities of the situation and the urgent need of\nbringing his investigation to a speedy termination, Sholmes proceeded\nto make an examination of the house in which he now found himself. He\npassed through Clotilde's boudoir into a corridor, at the end of which\nthere was a stairway leading to the lower floor; he was about to descend\nthis stairway when he heard voices below, which caused him to change his\nroute. He followed the corridor, which was a circular one, and\ndiscovered another stairway, which he descended and found himself amidst\nsurroundings that bore a familiar appearance. He passed through a door\nthat stood partly open and entered a large circular room. It was\nMonsieur Destange's library.\n\n\"Ah! splendid!\" he exclaimed. \"Now I understand everything. The boudoir\nof Mademoiselle Clotilde--the blonde Lady--communicates with a room in\nthe adjoining house, and that house does not front on the Place\nMalesherbes, but upon an adjacent street, the rue Montchanin, if I\nremember the name correctly.... And I now understand how Clotilde\nDestange can meet her lover and at the same time create the impression\nthat she never leaves the house; and I understand also how Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin\nwas enabled to make his mysterious entrance to the gallery last night.\nAh! there must be another connection between the library and the\nadjoining room. One more house full of ways that are dark! And no doubt\nLucien Destange was the architect, as usual!... I should take advantage\nof this opportunity to examine the contents of the cupboard and perhaps\nlearn the location of other houses with secret passages constructed by\nMonsieur Destange.\"\n\nSholmes ascended to the gallery and concealed himself behind some\ndraperies, where he remained until late in the evening. At last a\nservant came and turned off the electric lights. An hour later the\nEnglishman, by the light of his lantern, made his way to the cupboard.\nAs he had surmised, it contained the architect's old papers, plans,\nspecifications and books of account. It also contained a series of\nregisters, arranged according to date, and Sholmes, having selected\nthose of the most recent dates, searched in the indexes for the name\n\"Harmingeat.\" He found it in one of the registers with a reference to\npage 63. Turning to that page, he read:\n\n\"Harmingeat, 40 rue Chalgrin.\"\n\nThis was followed by a detailed account of the work done in and about\nthe installation of a furnace in the house. And in the margin of the\nbook someone had written these words: \"See account M.B.\"\n\n\"Ah! I thought so!\" said Sholmes; \"the account M.B. is the one I want. I\nshall learn from it the actual residence of Monsieur Lupin.\"\n\nIt was morning before he found that important account. It comprised\nsixteen pages, one of which was a copy of the page on which was\ndescribed the work done for Mon. Harmingeat of the rue Chalgrin. Another\npage described the work performed for Mon. Vatinel as owner of the house\nat No. 25 rue Clapeyron. Another page was reserved for the Baron\nd'Hautrec, 134 avenue Henri-Martin; another was devoted to the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau\nde Crozon, and the eleven other pages to various owners of houses in\nParis.\n\nSholmes made a list of those eleven names and addresses; after which he\nreturned the books to their proper places, opened a window, jumped out\nonto the deserted street and closed the shutters behind him.\n\nWhen he reached his room at the hotel he lighted his pipe with all the\nsolemnity with which he was wont to characterize that act, and amidst\nclouds of smoke he studied the deductions that might be drawn from the\naccount of M.B., or rather, from the account of Maxime Bermond alias\nArs\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin.\n\nAt eight o'clock he sent the following message to Ganimard:\n\n     \"I expect to pass through the rue Pergolese this forenoon and will\n     inform you of a person whose arrest is of the highest importance.\n     In any event, be at home to-night and to-morrow until noon and have\n     at least thirty men at your service.\"\n\nThen he engaged an automobile at the stand on the boulevard, choosing\none whose chauffeur looked good-natured but dull-witted, and instructed\nhim to drive to the Place Malesherbes, where he stopped him about one\nhundred feet from Monsieur Destange's house.\n\n\"My boy, close your carriage,\" he said to the chauffeur; \"turn up the\ncollar of your coat, for the wind is cold, and wait patiently. At the\nend of an hour and a half, crank up your machine. When I return we will\ngo to the rue Pergolese.\"\n\nAs he was ascending the steps leading to the door a doubt entered his\nmind. Was it not a mistake on his part to be spending his time on the\naffairs of the blonde Lady, while Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin was preparing to move?\nWould he not be better engaged in trying to find the abode of his\nadversary amongst the eleven houses on his list?\n\n\"Ah!\" he exclaimed, \"when the blonde Lady becomes my prisoner, I shall\nbe master of the situation.\"\n\nAnd he rang the bell.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMonsieur Destange was already in the library. They had been working only\na few minutes, when Clotilde entered, bade her father good morning,\nentered the adjoining parlor and sat down to write. From his place\nSholmes could see her leaning over the table and from time to time\nabsorbed in deep meditation. After a short time he picked up a book and\nsaid to Monsieur Destange:\n\n\"Here is a book that Mademoiselle Destange asked me to bring to her when\nI found it.\"\n\nHe went into the little parlor, stood before Clotilde in such a manner\nthat her father could not see her, and said:\n\n\"I am Monsieur Stickmann, your father's new secretary.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Clotilde, without moving, \"my father has changed his\nsecretary? I didn't know it.\"\n\n\"Yes, mademoiselle, and I desire to speak with you.\"\n\n\"Kindly take a seat, monsieur; I have finished.\"\n\nShe added a few words to her letter, signed it, enclosed it in the\nenvelope, sealed it, pushed her writing material away, rang the\ntelephone, got in communication with her dressmaker, asked the latter to\nhasten the completion of a traveling dress, as she required it at once,\nand then, turning to Sholmes, she said:\n\n\"I am at your service, monsieur. But do you wish to speak before my\nfather? Would not that be better?\"\n\n\"No, mademoiselle; and I beg of you, do not raise your voice. It is\nbetter that Monsieur Destange should not hear us.\"\n\n\"For whose sake is it better?\"\n\n\"Yours, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"I cannot agree to hold any conversation with you that my father may not\nhear.\"\n\n\"But you must agree to this. It is imperative.\"\n\nBoth of them arose, eye to eye. She said:\n\n\"Speak, monsieur.\"\n\nStill standing, he commenced:\n\n\"You will be so good as to pardon me if I am mistaken on certain points\nof secondary importance. I will guarantee, however, the general accuracy\nof my statements.\"\n\n\"Can we not dispense with these preliminaries, monsieur? Or are they\nnecessary?\"\n\nSholmes felt the young woman was on her guard, so he replied:\n\n\"Very well; I will come to the point. Five years ago your father made\nthe acquaintance of a certain young man called Maxime Bermond, who was\nintroduced as a contractor or an architect, I am not sure which it was;\nbut it was one or the other. Monsieur Destange took a liking to the\nyoung man, and as the state of his health compelled him to retire from\nactive business, he entrusted to Monsieur Bermond the execution of\ncertain orders he had received from some of his old customers and which\nseemed to come within the scope of Monsieur Bermond's ability.\"\n\nHerlock Sholmes stopped. It seemed to him that the girl's pallor had\nincreased. Yet there was not the slightest tremor in her voice when she\nsaid:\n\n\"I know nothing about the circumstances to which you refer, monsieur,\nand I do not see in what way they can interest me.\"\n\n\"In this way, mademoiselle: You know, as well as I, that Maxime Bermond\nis also known by the name of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin.\"\n\nShe laughed, and said:\n\n\"Nonsense! Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin? Maxime Bermond is Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin? Oh! no! It\nisn't possible!\"\n\n\"I have the honor to inform you of that fact, and since you refuse to\nunderstand my meaning, I will add that Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin has found in this\nhouse a friend--more than a friend--and accomplice, blindly and\npassionately devoted to him.\"\n\nWithout emotion, or at least with so little emotion that Sholmes was\nastonished at her self-control, she declared:\n\n\"I do not understand your object, monsieur, and I do not care to; but I\ncommand you to say no more and leave this house.\"\n\n\"I have no intention of forcing my presence on you,\" replied Sholmes,\nwith equal sang-froid, \"but I shall not leave this house alone.\"\n\n\"And who will accompany you, monsieur?\"\n\n\"You will.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes, mademoiselle, we will leave this house together, and you will\nfollow me without one word of protest.\"\n\nThe strange feature of the foregoing interview was the absolute coolness\nof the two adversaries. It bore no resemblance to an implacable duel\nbetween two powerful wills; but, judging solely from their attitude and\nthe tone of their voices, an onlooker would have supposed their\nconversation to be nothing more serious than a courteous argument over\nsome impersonal subject.\n\nClotilde resumed her seat without deigning to reply to the last remark\nof Herlock Sholmes, except by a shrug of her shoulders. Sholmes looked\nat his watch and said:\n\n\"It is half-past ten. We will leave here in five minutes.\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"If not, I shall go to Monsieur Destange, and tell him----\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The truth. I will tell him of the vicious life of Maxime Bermond, and I\nwill tell him of the double life of his accomplice.\"\n\n\"Of his accomplice?\"\n\n\"Yes, of the woman known as the blonde Lady, of the woman who was\nblonde.\"\n\n\"What proofs will you give him?\"\n\n\"I will take him to the rue Chalgrin, and show him the secret passage\nmade by Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin's workmen,--while doing the work of which he had\nthe control--between the houses numbered 40 and 42; the passage which\nyou and he used two nights ago.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I will then take Monsieur Destange to the house of Monsieur Detinan; we\nwill descend the servant's stairway which was used by you and Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne\nLupin when you escaped from Ganimard, and we will search together the\nmeans of communication with the adjoining house, which fronts on the\nBoulevard des Batignolles, and not upon the rue Clapeyron.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I will take Monsieur Destange to the ch\u00c3\u00a2teau de Crozon, and it will be\neasy for him, who knows the nature of the work performed by Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin\nin the restoration of the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau, to discover the secret passages\nconstructed there by his workmen. It will thus be established that those\npassages allowed the blonde Lady to make a nocturnal visit to the\nCountess' room and take the blue diamond from the mantel; and, two weeks\nlater, by similar means, to enter the room of Herr Bleichen and conceal\nthe blue diamond in his tooth-powder--a strange action, I confess; a\nwoman's revenge, perhaps; but I don't know, and I don't care.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"After that,\" said Herlock Sholmes, in a more serious tone, \"I will take\nMonsieur Destange to 134 avenue Henri-Martin, and we will learn how the\nBaron d'Hautrec----\"\n\n\"No, no, keep quiet,\" stammered the girl, struck with a sudden terror,\n\"I forbid you!... you dare to say that it was I ... you accuse me?...\"\n\n\"I accuse you of having killed the Baron d'Hautrec.\"\n\n\"No, no, it is a lie.\"\n\n\"You killed the Baron d'Hautrec, mademoiselle. You entered his service\nunder the name of Antoinette Br\u00c3\u00a9hat, for the purpose of stealing the\nblue diamond and you killed him.\"\n\n\"Keep quiet, monsieur,\" she implored him. \"Since you know so much, you\nmust know that I did not murder the baron.\"\n\n\"I did not say that you murdered him, mademoiselle. Baron d'Hautrec was\nsubject to fits of insanity that only Sister Auguste could control. She\ntold me so herself. In her absence, he must have attacked you, and in\nthe course of the struggle you struck him in order to save your own\nlife. Frightened at your awful situation, you rang the bell, and fled\nwithout even taking the blue diamond from the finger of your victim. A\nfew minutes later you returned with one of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin's accomplices,\nwho was a servant in the adjoining house, you placed the baron on the\nbed, you put the room in order, but you were afraid to take the blue\ndiamond. Now, I have told you what happened on that night. I repeat, you\ndid not murder the baron, and yet it was your hand that struck the\nblow.\"\n\nShe had crossed them over her forehead--those long delicate white\nhands--and kept them thus for a long time. At last, loosening her\nfingers, she said, in a voice rent by anguish:\n\n\"And do you intend to tell all that to my father?\"\n\n\"Yes; and I will tell him that I have secured as witnesses: Mademoiselle\nGerbois, who will recognize the blonde Lady; Sister Auguste, who will\nrecognize Antoinette Br\u00c3\u00a9hat; and the Countess de Crozon, who will\nrecognize Madame de R\u00c3\u00a9al. That is what I shall tell him.\"\n\n\"You will not dare,\" she said, recovering her self-possession in the\nface of an immediate peril.\n\nHe arose, and made a step toward the library. Clotilde stopped him:\n\n\"One moment, monsieur.\"\n\nShe paused, reflected a moment, and then, perfect mistress of herself,\nsaid:\n\n\"You are Herlock Sholmes?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What do you want of me?\"\n\n\"What do I want? I am fighting a duel with Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin, and I must win.\nThe contest is now drawing to a climax, and I have an idea that a\nhostage as precious as you will give me an important advantage over my\nadversary. Therefore, you will follow me, mademoiselle; I will entrust\nyou to one of my friends. As soon as the duel is ended, you will be set\nat liberty.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"That is all. I do not belong to the police service of this country,\nand, consequently, I do not consider that I am under any obligation ...\nto cause your arrest.\"\n\nShe appeared to have come to a decision ... yet she required a momentary\nrespite. She closed her eyes, the better to concentrate her thoughts.\nSholmes looked at her in surprise; she was now so tranquil and,\napparently, indifferent to the dangers which threatened her. Sholmes\nthought: Does she believe that she is in danger? Probably not--since\nLupin protects her. She has confidence in him. She believes that Lupin\nis omnipotent, and infallible.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" he said, \"I told you that we would leave here in five\nminutes. That time has almost expired.\"\n\n\"Will you permit me to go to my room, monsieur, to get some necessary\narticles?\"\n\n\"Certainly, mademoiselle; and I will wait for you in the rue Montchanin.\nJeanniot, the concierge, is a friend of mine.\"\n\n\"Ah! you know....\" she said, visibly alarmed.\n\n\"I know many things.\"\n\n\"Very well. I will ring for the maid.\"\n\nThe maid brought her hat and jacket. Then Sholmes said:\n\n\"You must give Monsieur Destange some reason for our departure, and, if\npossible, let your excuse serve for an absence of several days.\"\n\n\"That shall not be necessary. I shall be back very soon.\"\n\n\"They exchanged defiant glances and an ironic smile.\n\n\"What faith you have in him!\" said Sholmes.\n\n\"Absolute.\"\n\n\"He does everything well, doesn't he? He succeeds in everything he\nundertakes. And whatever he does receives your approval and\ncooperation.\"\n\n\"I love him,\" she said, with a touch of passion in her voice.\n\n\"And you think that he will save you?\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders, and, approaching her father, she said:\n\n\"I am going to deprive you of Monsieur Stickmann. We are going to the\nNational Library.\"\n\n\"You will return for luncheon?\"\n\n\"Perhaps ... no, I think not ... but don't be uneasy.\"\n\nThen she said to Sholmes, in a firm voice:\n\n\"I am at your service, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Absolutely?\"\n\n\"Quite so.\"\n\n\"I warn you that if you attempt to escape, I shall call the police and\nhave you arrested. Do not forget that the blonde Lady is on parole.\"\n\n\"I give you my word of honor that I shall not attempt to escape.\"\n\n\"I believe you. Now, let us go.\"\n\nThey left the house together, as he had predicted.\n\nThe automobile was standing where Sholmes had left it. As they\napproached it, Sholmes could hear the rumbling of the motor. He opened\nthe door, asked Clotilde to enter, and took a seat beside her. The\nmachine started at once, gained the exterior boulevards, the avenue\nHoche and the avenue de la Grande-Arm\u00c3\u00a9e. Sholmes was considering his\nplans. He thought:\n\n\"Ganimard is at home. I will leave the girl in his care. Shall I tell\nhim who she is? No, he would take her to prison at once, and that would\nspoil everything. When I am alone, I can consult my list of addresses\ntaken from the 'account M.B.,' and run them down. To-night, or to-morrow\nmorning at the latest, I shall go to Ganimard, as I agreed, and deliver\ninto his hands Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin and all his band.\"\n\nHe rubbed his hand, gleefully, at the thought that his duel with Lupin\nwas drawing to a close, and he could not see any serious obstacle in the\nway of his success. And, yielding to an irrepressible desire to give\nvent to his feelings--an unusual desire on his part--he exclaimed:\n\n\"Excuse me, mademoiselle, if I am unable to conceal my satisfaction and\ndelight. The battle has been a difficult one, and my success is,\ntherefore, more enjoyable.\"\n\n\"A legitimate success, monsieur, of which you have a just right to be\nproud.\"\n\n\"Thank you. But where are we going? The chauffeur must have\nmisunderstood my directions.\"\n\nAt that moment they were leaving Paris by the gate de Neuilly. That was\nstrange, as the rue Pergolese is not outside the fortifications. Sholmes\nlowered the glass, and said:\n\n\"Chauffeur, you have made a mistake.... Rue Pergolese!\"\n\nThe man made no reply. Sholmes repeated, in a louder voice:\n\n\"I told you to go to the rue Pergolese.\"\n\nStill the man did not reply.\n\n\"Ah! but you are deaf, my friend. Or is he doing it on purpose? We are\nvery much out of our way.... Rue Pergolese!... Turn back at once!... Rue\nPergolese!\"\n\nThe chauffeur made no sign of having heard the order. The Englishman\nfretted with impatience. He looked at Clotilde; a mysterious smile\nplayed upon her lips.\n\n\"Why do you laugh?\" he said. \"It is an awkward mistake, but it won't\nhelp you.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" she replied.\n\nThen an idea occurred to him. He rose and made a careful scrutiny of the\nchauffeur. His shoulders were not so broad; his bearing was not so stiff\nand mechanical. A cold perspiration covered his forehead and his hands\nclenched with sudden fear, as his mind was seized with the conviction\nthat the chauffeur was Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin.\n\n\"Well, Monsieur Sholmes, what do you think of our little ride?\"\n\n\"Delightful, monsieur, really delightful,\" replied Sholmes.\n\nNever in his life had he experienced so much difficulty in uttering a\nfew simple words without a tremor, or without betraying his feelings in\nhis voice. But quickly, by a sort of reaction, a flood of hatred and\nrage burst its bounds, overcame his self-control, and, brusquely drawing\nhis revolver, he pointed it at Mademoiselle Destange.\n\n\"Lupin, stop, this minute, this second, or I fire at mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"I advise you to aim at the cheek if you wish to hit the temple,\"\nreplied Lupin, without turning his head.\n\n\"Maxime, don't go so fast,\" said Clotilde, \"the pavement is slippery and\nI am very timid.\"\n\nShe was smiling; her eyes were fixed on the pavement, over which the\ncarriage was traveling at enormous speed.\n\n\"Let him stop! Let him stop!\" said Sholmes to her, wild with rage, \"I\nwarn you that I am desperate.\"\n\nThe barrel of the revolver brushed the waving locks of her hair. She\nreplied, calmly:\n\n\"Maxime is so imprudent. He is going so fast, I am really afraid of some\naccident.\"\n\nSholmes returned the weapon to his pocket and seized the handle of the\ndoor, as if to alight, despite the absurdity of such an act. Clotilde\nsaid to him:\n\n\"Be careful, monsieur, there is an automobile behind us.\"\n\nHe leaned over. There was an automobile close behind; a large machine of\nformidable aspect with its sharp prow and blood-red body, and holding\nfour men clad in fur coats.\n\n\"Ah! I am well guarded,\" thought Sholmes. \"I may as well be patient.\"\n\nHe folded his arms across his chest with that proud air of submission so\nfrequently assumed by heroes when fate has turned against them. And\nwhile they crossed the river Seine and rushed through Suresnes, Rueil\nand Chatou, motionless and resigned, controlling his actions and his\npassions, he tried to explain to his own satisfaction by what miracle\nArs\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin had substituted himself for the chauffeur. It was quite\nimprobable that the honest-looking fellow he had selected on the\nboulevard that morning was an accomplice placed there in advance. And\nyet Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin had received a warning in some way, and it must have\nbeen after he, Sholmes, had approached Clotilde in the house, because no\none could have suspected his project prior to that time. Since then,\nSholmes had not allowed Clotilde out of his sight.\n\nThen an idea struck him: the telephone communication desired by Clotilde\nand her conversation with the dressmaker. Now, it was all quite clear to\nhim. Even before he had spoken to her, simply upon his request to speak\nto her as the new secretary of Monsieur Destange, she had scented the\ndanger, surmised the name and purpose of the visitor, and, calmly,\nnaturally, as if she were performing a commonplace action of her\nevery-day life, she had called Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin to her assistance by some\npreconcerted signal.\n\nHow Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin had come and caused himself to be substituted for the\nchauffeur were matters of trifling importance. That which affected\nSholmes, even to the point of appeasing his fury, was the recollection\nof that incident whereby an ordinary woman, a sweetheart it is true,\nmastering her nerves, controlling her features, and subjugating the\nexpression of her eyes, had completely deceived the astute detective\nHerlock Sholmes. How difficult to overcome an adversary who is aided by\nsuch confederates, and who, by the mere force of his authority, inspires\nin a woman so much courage and strength!\n\nThey crossed the Seine and climbed the hill at Saint-Germain; but, some\nfive hundred metres beyond that town, the automobile slackened its\nspeed. The other automobile advanced, and the two stopped, side by side.\nThere was no one else in the neighborhood.\n\n\"Monsieur Sholmes,\" said Lupin, \"kindly exchange to the other machine.\nOurs is really a very slow one.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Sholmes, calmly, convinced that he had no choice.\n\n\"Also, permit me to loan you a fur coat, as we will travel quite fast\nand the air is cool. And accept a couple of sandwiches, as we cannot\ntell when we will dine.\"\n\nThe four men alighted from the other automobile. One of them approached,\nand, as he raised his goggles, Sholmes recognized in him the gentleman\nin the frock coat that he had seen at the Hungarian restaurant. Lupin\nsaid to him:\n\n\"You will return this machine to the chauffeur from whom I hired it. He\nis waiting in the first wine-shop to the right as you go up the rue\nLegendre. You will give him the balance of the thousand francs I\npromised him.... Ah! yes, kindly give your goggles to Monsieur Sholmes.\"\n\nHe talked to Mlle. Destange for a moment, then took his place at the\nwheel and started, with Sholmes at his side and one of his men behind\nhim. Lupin had not exaggerated when he said \"we will travel quite fast.\"\nFrom the beginning he set a breakneck pace. The horizon rushed to meet\nthem, as if attracted by some mysterious force, and disappeared\ninstantly as though swallowed up in an abyss, into which many other\nthings, such as trees, houses, fields and forests, were hurled with the\ntumultuous fury and haste of a torrent as it approached the cataract.\n\nSholmes and Lupin did not exchange a word. Above their heads the leaves\nof the poplars made a great noise like the waves of the sea,\nrhythmically arranged by the regular spacing of the trees. And the towns\nswept by like spectres: Manteo, Vernon, Gaillon. From one hill to the\nother, from Bon-Secours to Canteleu, Rouen, its suburbs, its harbor, its\nmiles of wharves, Rouen seemed like the straggling street of a country\nvillage. And this was Duclair, Caudebec, the country of Caux which they\nskimmed over in their terrific flight, and Lillebonne, and Quillebeuf.\nThen, suddenly, they found themselves on the banks of the Seine, at the\nextremity of a little wharf, beside which lay a staunch sea-going yacht\nthat emitted great volumes of black smoke from its funnel.\n\nThe automobile stopped. In two hours they had traveled over forty\nleagues.\n\nA man, wearing a blue uniform and a goldlaced cap, came forward and\nsaluted. Lupin said to him:\n\n\"All ready, captain? Did you receive my telegram?\"\n\n\"Yes, I got it.\"\n\n\"Is _The Swallow_ ready?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Come, Monsieur Sholmes.\"\n\nThe Englishman looked around, saw a group of people on the terrace in\nfront of a caf\u00c3\u00a9, hesitated a moment, then, realizing that before he\ncould secure any assistance he would be seized, carried aboard and\nplaced in the bottom of the hold, he crossed the gang-plank and followed\nLupin into the captain's cabin. It was quite a large room, scrupulously\nclean, and presented a cheerful appearance with its varnished woodwork\nand polished brass. Lupin closed the door and addressed Sholmes\nabruptly, and almost rudely, as he said:\n\n\"Well, what do you know?\"\n\n\"Everything.\"\n\n\"Everything? Come, be precise.\"\n\nHis voice contained no longer that polite, if ironical, tone, which he\nhad affected when speaking to the Englishman. Now, his voice had the\nimperious tone of a master accustomed to command and accustomed to be\nobeyed--even by a Herlock Sholmes. They measured each other by their\nlooks, enemies now--open and implacable foes. Lupin spoke again, but in\na milder tone:\n\n\"I have grown weary of your pursuit, and do not intend to waste any more\ntime in avoiding the traps you lay for me. I warn you that my treatment\nof you will depend on your reply. Now, what do you know?\"\n\n\"Everything, monsieur.\"\n\nArs\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin controlled his temper and said, in a jerky manner:\n\n\"I will tell you what you know. You know that, under the name of Maxime\nBermond, I have ... _improved_ fifteen houses that were originally\nconstructed by Monsieur Destange.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Of those fifteen houses, you have seen four.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you have a list of the other eleven.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You made that list at Monsieur Destange's house on that night, no\ndoubt.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you have an idea that, amongst those eleven houses, there is one\nthat I have kept for the use of myself and my friends, and you have\nintrusted to Ganimard the task of finding my retreat.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What does that signify?\"\n\n\"It signifies that I choose to act alone, and do not want his help.\"\n\n\"Then I have nothing to fear, since you are in my hands.\"\n\n\"You have nothing to fear as long as I remain in your hands.\"\n\n\"You mean that you will not remain?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nArs\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin approached the Englishman and, placing his hand on the\nlatter's shoulder, said:\n\n\"Listen, monsieur; I am not in a humor to argue with you, and,\nunfortunately for you, you are not in a position to choose. So let us\nfinish our business.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"You are going to give me your word of honor that you will not try to\nescape from this boat until you arrive in English waters.\"\n\n\"I give you my word of honor that I shall escape if I have an\nopportunity,\" replied the indomitable Sholmes.\n\n\"But, sapristi! you know quite well that at a word from me you would\nsoon be rendered helpless. All these men will obey me blindly. At a sign\nfrom me they would place you in irons----\"\n\n\"Irons can be broken.\"\n\n\"And throw you overboard ten miles from shore.\"\n\n\"I can swim.\"\n\n\"I hadn't thought of that,\" said Lupin, with a laugh. \"Excuse me, master\n... and let us finish. You will agree that I must take the measures\nnecessary to protect myself and my friends.\"\n\n\"Certainly; but they will be useless.\"\n\n\"And yet you do not wish me to take them.\"\n\n\"It is your duty.\"\n\n\"Very well, then.\"\n\nLupin opened the door and called the captain and two sailors. The latter\nseized the Englishman, bound him hand and foot, and tied him to the\ncaptain's bunk.\n\n\"That will do,\" said Lupin. \"It was only on account of your obstinacy\nand the unusual gravity of the situation, that I ventured to offer you\nthis indignity.\"\n\nThe sailors retired. Lupin said to the captain:\n\n\"Let one of the crew remain here to look after Monsieur Sholmes, and you\ncan give him as much of your own company as possible. Treat him with all\ndue respect and consideration. He is not a prisoner, but a guest. What\ntime have you, captain?\"\n\n\"Five minutes after two.\"\n\nLupin consulted his watch, then looked at the clock that was attached to\nthe wall of the cabin.\n\n\"Five minutes past two is right. How long will it take you to reach\nSouthampton?\"\n\n\"Nine hours, easy going.\"\n\n\"Make it eleven. You must not land there until after the departure of\nthe midnight boat, which reaches Havre at eight o'clock in the morning.\nDo you understand, captain? Let me repeat: As it would be very dangerous\nfor all of us to permit Monsieur to return to France by that boat, you\nmust not reach Southampton before one o'clock in the morning.\"\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\n\"Au revoir, master; next year, in this world or in the next.\"\n\n\"Until to-morrow,\" replied Sholmes.\n\nA few minutes later Sholmes heard the automobile going away, and at the\nsame time the steam puffed violently in the depths of _The Swallow_. The\nboat had started for England. About three o'clock the vessel left the\nmouth of the river and plunged into the open sea. At that moment Sholmes\nwas lying on the captain's bunk, sound asleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNext morning--it being the tenth and last day of the duel between\nSholmes and Lupin--the _Echo de France_ published this interesting bit\nof news:\n\n\"Yesterday a judgment of ejectment was entered in the case of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne\nLupin against Herlock Sholmes, the English detective. Although signed at\nnoon, the judgment was executed the same day. At one o'clock this\nmorning Sholmes was landed at Southampton.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nSECOND ARREST OF ARS\u00c3\u0088NE LUPIN.\n\n\nSince eight o'clock a dozen moving-vans had encumbered the rue Crevaux\nbetween the avenue du Bois-de-Boulogne and the avenue Bugeaud. Mon.\nFelix Davey was leaving the apartment in which he lived on the fourth\nfloor of No. 8; and Mon. Dubreuil, who had united into a single\napartment the fifth floor of the same house and the fifth floor of the\ntwo adjoining houses, was moving on the same day--a mere coincidence,\nsince the gentlemen were unknown to each other--the vast collection of\nfurniture regarding which so many foreign agents visited him every day.\n\nA circumstance which had been noticed by some of the neighbors, but was\nnot spoken of until later, was this: None of the twelve vans bore the\nname and address of the owner, and none of the men accompanying them\nvisited the neighboring wine shops. They worked so diligently that the\nfurniture was all out by eleven o'clock. Nothing remained but those\nscraps of papers and rags that are always left behind in the corners of\nthe empty rooms.\n\nMon. Felix Davey, an elegant young man, dressed in the latest fashion,\ncarried in his hand a walking-stick, the weight of which indicated that\nits owner possessed extraordinary biceps--Mon. Felix Davey walked calmly\naway and took a seat on a bench in the avenue du Bois-de-Boulogne facing\nthe rue Pergolese. Close to him a woman, dressed in a neat but\ninexpensive costume, was reading a newspaper, whilst a child was playing\nwith a shovel in a heap of sand.\n\nAfter a few minutes Felix Davey spoke to the woman, without turning his\nhead:\n\n\"Ganimard!\"\n\n\"Went out at nine o'clock this morning.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"To police headquarters.\"\n\n\"Alone?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"No telegram during the night?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do they suspect you in the house?\"\n\n\"No; I do some little things for Madame Ganimard, and she tells me\neverything her husband does. I have been with her all morning.\"\n\n\"Very well. Until further orders come here every day at eleven o'clock.\"\n\nHe rose and walked away in the direction of the Dauphine gate, stopping\nat the Chinese pavilion, where he partook of a frugal repast consisting\nof two eggs, with some fruit and vegetables. Then he returned to the rue\nCrevaux and said to the concierge:\n\n\"I will just glance through the rooms and then give you the keys.\"\n\nHe finished his inspection of the room that he had used as a library;\nthen he seized the end of a gas-pipe, which hung down the side of the\nchimney. The pipe was bent and a hole made in the elbow. To this hole he\nfitted a small instrument in the form of an ear-trumpet and blew into\nit. A slight whistling sound came by way of reply. Placing the trumpet\nto his mouth, he said:\n\n\"Anyone around, Dubreuil?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"May I come up!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe returned the pipe to its place, saying to himself:\n\n\"How progressive we are! Our century abounds with little inventions\nwhich render life really charming and picturesque. And so amusing!...\nespecially when a person knows how to enjoy life as I do.\"\n\nHe turned one of the marble mouldings of the mantel, and the entire half\nof the mantel moved, and the mirror above it glided in invisible\ngrooves, disclosing an opening and the lower steps of a stairs built in\nthe very body of the chimney; all very clean and complete--the stairs\nwere constructed of polished metal and the walls of white tiles. He\nascended the steps, and at the fifth floor there was the same opening in\nthe chimney. Mon. Dubreuil was waiting for him.\n\n\"Have you finished in your rooms?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Everything cleared out?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And the people?\"\n\n\"Only the three men on guard.\"\n\n\"Very well; come on.\"\n\nThey ascended to the upper floor by the same means, one after the other,\nand there found three men, one of whom was looking through the window.\n\n\"Anything new?\"\n\n\"Nothing, governor.\"\n\n\"All quiet in the street?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"In ten minutes I will be ready to leave. You will go also. But in the\nmeantime if you see the least suspicious movement in the street, warn\nme.\"\n\n\"I have my finger on the alarm-bell all the time.\"\n\n\"Dubreuil, did you tell the moving men not to touch the wire of that\nbell?\"\n\n\"Certainly; it is working all right.\"\n\n\"That is all I want to know.\"\n\nThe two gentlemen then descended to the apartment of Felix Davey and the\nlatter, after adjusting the marble mantel, exclaimed, joyfully:\n\n\"Dubreuil, I should like to see the man who is able to discover all the\ningenious devices, warning bells, net-works of electric wires and\nacoustic tubes, invisible passages, moving floors and hidden stairways.\nA real fairy-land!\"\n\n\"What fame for Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin!\"\n\n\"Fame I could well dispense with. It's a pity to be compelled to leave a\nplace so well equipped, and commence all over again, Dubreuil ... and on\na new model, of course, for it would never do to duplicate this. Curse\nHerlock Sholmes!\"\n\n\"Has he returned to Paris?\"\n\n\"How could he? There has been only one boat come from Southampton and it\nleft there at midnight; only one train from Havre, leaving there at\neight o'clock this morning and due in Paris at eleven fifteen. As he\ncould not catch the midnight boat at Southampton--and the instructions\nto the captain on that point were explicit--he cannot reach France until\nthis evening via Newhaven and Dieppe.\"\n\n\"Do you think he will come back?\"\n\n\"Yes; he never gives up. He will return to Paris; but it will be too\nlate. We will be far away.\"\n\n\"And Mademoiselle Destange?\"\n\n\"I am to see her in an hour.\"\n\n\"At her house?\"\n\n\"Oh! no; she will not return there for several days. But you, Dubreuil,\nyou must hurry. The loading of our goods will take a long time and you\nshould be there to look after them.\"\n\n\"Are you sure that we are not being watched?\"\n\n\"By whom? I am not afraid of anyone but Sholmes.\"\n\nDubreuil retired. Felix Davey made a last tour of the apartment, picked\nup two or three torn letters, then, noticing a piece of chalk, he took\nit and, on the dark paper of the drawing-room, drew a large frame and\nwrote within it the following:\n\n\"_Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin, gentleman-burglar, lived here for five years at the\nbeginning of the twentieth century_.\"\n\nThis little pleasantry seemed to please him very much. He looked at it\nfor a moment, whistling a lively air, then said to himself:\n\n\"Now that I have placed myself in touch with the historians of future\ngenerations, I can go. You must hurry, Herlock Sholmes, as I shall leave\nmy present abode in three minutes, and your defeat will be an\naccomplished fact.... Two minutes more! you are keeping me waiting,\nMonsieur Sholmes.... One minute more! Are you not coming? Well, then, I\nproclaim your downfall and my apotheosis. And now I make my escape.\nFarewell, kingdom of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin! I shall never see you again. Farewell\nto the fifty-five rooms of the six apartments over which I reigned!\nFarewell, my own royal bed chamber!\"\n\nHis outburst of joy was interrupted by the sharp ringing of a bell,\nwhich stopped twice, started again and then ceased. It was the alarm\nbell.\n\nWhat was wrong? What unforeseen danger? Ganimard? No; that wasn't\npossible!\n\nHe was on the point of returning to his library and making his escape.\nBut, first, he went to the window. There was no one in the street. Was\nthe enemy already in the house? He listened and thought he could discern\ncertain confused sounds. He hesitated no longer. He ran to his library,\nand as he crossed the threshold he heard the noise of a key being\ninserted in the lock of the vestibule door.\n\n\"The deuce!\" he murmured; \"I have no time to lose. The house may be\nsurrounded. The servants' stairway--impossible! Fortunately, there is\nthe chimney.\"\n\nHe pushed the moulding; it did not move. He made a greater effort--still\nit refused to move. At the same time he had the impression that the door\nbelow opened and that he could hear footsteps.\n\n\"Good God!\" he cried; \"I am lost if this cursed mechanism--\"\n\nHe pushed with all his strength. Nothing moved--nothing! By some\nincredible accident, by some evil stroke of fortune, the mechanism,\nwhich had worked only a few moments ago, would not work now.\n\nHe was furious. The block of marble remained immovable. He uttered\nfrightful imprecations on the senseless stone. Was his escape to be\nprevented by that stupid obstacle? He struck the marble wildly, madly;\nhe hammered it, he cursed it.\n\n\"Ah! what's the matter, Monsieur Lupin? You seem to be displeased about\nsomething.\"\n\nLupin turned around. Herlock Sholmes stood before him!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHerlock Sholmes!... Lupin gazed at him with squinting eyes as if his\nsight were defective and misleading. Herlock Sholmes in Paris! Herlock\nSholmes, whom he had shipped to England only the day before as a\ndangerous person, now stood before him free and victorious!... Ah! such\na thing was nothing less than a miracle; it was contrary to all natural\nlaws; it was the culmination of all that is illogical and abnormal....\nHerlock Sholmes here--before his face!\n\nAnd when the Englishman spoke his words were tinged with that keen\nsarcasm and mocking politeness with which his adversary had so often\nlashed him. He said:\n\n\"Monsieur Lupin, in, the first place I have the honor to inform you that\nat this time and place I blot from my memory forever all thoughts of\nthe miserable night that you forced me to endure in the house of Baron\nd'Hautrec, of the injury done to my friend Wilson, of my abduction in\nthe automobile, and of the voyage I took yesterday under your orders,\nbound to a very uncomfortable couch. But the joy of this moment effaces\nall those bitter memories. I forgive everything. I forget everything--I\nwipe out the debt. I am paid--and royally paid.\"\n\nLupin made no reply. So the Englishman continued:\n\n\"Don't you think so yourself?\"\n\nHe appeared to insist as if demanding an acquiescence, as a sort of\nreceipt in regard to the part.\n\nAfter a moment's reflection, during which the Englishman felt that he\nwas scrutinized to the very depth of his soul, Lupin declared:\n\n\"I presume, monsieur, that your conduct is based upon serious motives?\"\n\n\"Very serious.\"\n\n\"The fact that you have escaped from my captain and his crew is only a\nsecondary incident of our struggle. But the fact that you are here\nbefore me alone--understand, alone--face to face with Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin,\nleads me to think that your revenge is as complete as possible.\"\n\n\"As complete as possible.\"\n\n\"This house?\"\n\n\"Surrounded.\"\n\n\"The two adjoining houses?\"\n\n\"Surrounded.\"\n\n\"The apartment above this?\"\n\n\"The _three_ apartments on the fifth floor that were formerly occupied\nby Monsieur Dubreuil are surrounded.\"\n\n\"So that----\"\n\n\"So that you are captured, Monsieur Lupin--absolutely captured.\"\n\nThe feelings that Sholmes had experienced during his trip in the\nautomobile were now suffered by Lupin, the same concentrated fury, the\nsame revolt, and also, let us admit, the same loyalty of submission to\nforce of circumstances. Equally brave in victory or defeat.\n\n\"Our accounts are squared, monsieur,\" said Lupin, frankly.\n\nThe Englishman was pleased with that confession. After a short silence\nLupin, now quite self-possessed, said smiling:\n\n\"And I am not sorry! It becomes monotonous to win all the time.\nYesterday I had only to stretch out my hand to finish you forever.\nToday I belong to you. The game is yours.\" Lupin laughed heartily and\nthen continued: \"At last the gallery will be entertained! Lupin in\nprison! How will he get out? In prison!... What an adventure!... Ah!\nSholmes, life is just one damn thing after another!\"\n\nHe pressed his closed hands to his temples as if to suppress the\ntumultuous joy that surged within him, and his actions indicated that he\nwas moved by an uncontrollable mirth. At last, when he had recovered his\nself-possession, he approached the detective and said:\n\n\"And now what are you waiting for?\"\n\n\"What am I waiting for?\"\n\n\"Yes; Ganimard is here with his men--why don't they come in?\"\n\n\"I asked him not to.\"\n\n\"And he consented?\"\n\n\"I accepted his services on condition that he would be guided by me.\nBesides, he thinks that Felix Davey is only an accomplice of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne\nLupin.\"\n\n\"Then I will repeat my question in another form. Why did you come in\nalone?\"\n\n\"Because I wished to speak to you alone.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah! you have something to say to me.\"\n\nThat idea seemed to please Lupin immensely. There are certain\ncircumstances in which words are preferable to deeds.\n\n\"Monsieur Sholmes, I am sorry I cannot offer you an easy chair. How\nwould you like that broken box? Or perhaps you would prefer the window\nledge? I am sure a glass of beer would be welcome ... light or dark?...\nBut sit down, please.\"\n\n\"Thank you; we can talk as well standing up.\"\n\n\"Very well--proceed.\"\n\n\"I will be brief. The object of my sojourn in France was not to\naccomplish your arrest. If I have been led to pursue you, it was because\nI saw no other way to achieve my real object.\"\n\n\"Which was?\"\n\n\"To recover the blue diamond.\"\n\n\"The blue diamond!\"\n\n\"Certainly; since the one found in Herr Bleichen's tooth-powder was only\nan imitation.\"\n\n\"Quite right; the genuine diamond was taken by the blonde Lady. I made\nan exact duplicate of it and then, as I had designs on other jewels\nbelonging to the Countess and as the Consul Herr Bleichen was already\nunder suspicion, the aforesaid blonde Lady, in order to avert suspicion,\nslipped the false stone into the aforesaid Consul's luggage.\"\n\n\"While you kept the genuine diamond?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"That diamond--I want it.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry, but it is impossible.\"\n\n\"I have promised it to the Countess de Crozon. I must have it.\"\n\n\"How will you get it, since it is in my possession?\"\n\n\"That is precisely the reason--because it is in your possession.\"\n\n\"Oh! I am to give it to you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Voluntarily?\"\n\n\"I will buy it.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Lupin, in an access of mirth, \"you are certainly an\nEnglishman. You treat this as a matter of business.\"\n\n\"It is a matter of business.\"\n\n\"Well? what is your offer?\"\n\n\"The liberty of Mademoiselle Destange.\"\n\n\"Her liberty?... I didn't know she was under arrest.\"\n\n\"I will give Monsieur Ganimard the necessary information. When deprived\nof your protection, she can readily be taken.\"\n\nLupin laughed again, and said:\n\n\"My dear monsieur, you are offering me something you do not possess.\nMademoiselle Destange is in a place of safety, and has nothing to fear.\nYou must make me another offer.\"\n\nThe Englishman hesitated, visibly embarrassed and vexed. Then, placing\nhis hand on the shoulder of his adversary, he said:\n\n\"And if I should propose to you-\"\n\n\"My liberty?\"\n\n\"No ... but I can leave the room to consult with Ganimard.\"\n\n\"And leave me alone!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Ah! mon dieu, what good would that be? The cursed mechanism will not\nwork,\" said Lupin, at the same time savagely pushing the moulding of the\nmantel. He stifled a cry of surprise; this time fortune favored him--the\nblock of marble moved. It was his salvation; his hope of escape. In that\nevent, why submit to the conditions imposed by Sholmes? He paced up and\ndown the room, as if he were considering his reply. Then, in his turn,\nhe placed his hand on the shoulder of his adversary, and said:\n\n\"All things considered, Monsieur Sholmes, I prefer to do my own business\nin my own way.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"No, I don't require anyone's assistance.\"\n\n\"When Ganimard gets his hand on you, it will be all over. You can't\nescape from them.\"\n\n\"Who knows?\"\n\n\"Come, that is foolish. Every door and window is guarded.\"\n\n\"Except one.\"\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n\"_The one I will choose_.\"\n\n\"Mere words! Your arrest is as good as made.\"\n\n\"Oh! no--not at all.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I shall keep the blue diamond.\"\n\nSholmes looked at his watch, and said:\n\n\"It is now ten minutes to three. At three o'clock I shall call\nGanimard.\"\n\n\"Well, then, we have ten minutes to chat. And to satisfy my curiosity,\nMonsieur Sholmes, I should like to know how you procured my address and\nmy name of Felix Davey?\"\n\nAlthough his adversary's easy manner caused Sholmes some anxiety, he was\nwilling to give Lupin the desired information since it reflected credit\non his professional astuteness; so he replied:\n\n\"Your address? I got it from the blonde Lady.\"\n\n\"Clotilde!\"\n\n\"Herself. Do you remember, yesterday morning, when I wished to take her\naway in the automobile, she telephoned to her dressmaker.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, I understood, later, that you were the dressmaker. And last\nnight, on the boat, by exercising my memory--and my memory is something\nI have good reason to be proud of--I was able to recollect the last two\nfigures of your telephone number--73. Then, as I possessed a list of the\nhouses you had 'improved,' it was an easy matter, on my arrival in Paris\nat eleven o'clock this morning, to search in the telephone directory and\nfind there the name and address of Felix Davey. Having obtained that\ninformation, I asked the aid of Monsieur Ganimard.\"\n\n\"Admirable! I congratulate you. But bow did you manage to catch the\neight o'clock train at Havre! How did you escape from _The Swallow_?\"\n\n\"I did not escape.\"\n\n\"But----\"\n\n\"You ordered the captain not to reach Southampton before one o'clock. He\nlanded me there at midnight. I was able to catch the twelve o'clock boat\nfor Havre.\"\n\n\"Did the captain betray me? I can't believe it.\"\n\n\"No, he did not betray you.\"\n\n\"Well, what then?\"\n\n\"It was his watch.\"\n\n\"His watch?\"\n\n\"Yes, I put it ahead one hour.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"In the usual way, by turning the hands. We were sitting side by side,\ntalking, and I was telling him some funny stories.... Why! he never saw\nme do it.\"\n\n\"Bravo! a very clever trick. I shall not forget it. But the clock that\nwas hanging on the wall of the cabin?\"\n\n\"Ah! the clock was a more difficult matter, as my feet were tied, but\nthe sailor, who guarded me during the captain's absence, was kind\nenough to turn the hands for me.\"\n\n\"He? Nonsense! He wouldn't do it.\"\n\n\"Oh! but he didn't know the importance of his act. I told him I must\ncatch the first train for London, at any price, and ... he allowed\nhimself to be persuaded----\"\n\n\"By means of----\"\n\n\"By means of a slight gift, which the excellent fellow, loyal and true\nto his master, intends to send to you.\"\n\n\"What was it!\"\n\n\"A mere trifle.\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"The blue diamond.\"\n\n\"The blue diamond!\"\n\n\"Yes, the false stone that you substituted for the Countess' diamond.\nShe gave it to me.\"\n\nThere was a sudden explosion of violent laughter. Lupin laughed until\nthe tears started in his eyes.\n\n\"Mon dieu, but it is funny! My false diamond palmed off on my innocent\nsailor! And the captain's watch! And the hands of the clock!\"\n\nSholmes felt that the duel between him and Lupin was keener than ever.\nHis marvellous instinct warned him that, behind his adversary's display\nof mirth, there was a shrewd intellect debating the ways and means to\nescape. Gradually Lupin approached the Englishman, who recoiled, and,\nunconsciously, slipped his hand into his watch-pocket.\n\n\"It is three o'clock, Monsieur Lupin.\"\n\n\"Three o'clock, already! What a pity! We were enjoying our chat so\nmuch.\"\n\n\"I am waiting for your answer.\"\n\n\"My answer? Mon dieu! but you are particular!... And so this is the last\nmove in our little game--and the stake is my liberty!\"\n\n\"Or the blue diamond.\"\n\n\"Very well. It's your play. What are you going to do!\"\n\n\"I play the king,\" said Sholmes, as he fired his revolver.\n\n\"And I the ace,\" replied Lupin, as he struck at Sholmes with his fist.\n\nSholmes had fired into the air, as a signal to Ganimard, whose\nassistance he required. But Lupin's fist had caught Sholmes in the\nstomach, and caused him to double up with pain. Lupin rushed to the\nfireplace and set the marble slab in motion.... Too late! The door\nopened.\n\n\"Surrender, Lupin, or I fire!\"\n\nGanimard, doubtless stationed closer than Lupin had thought, Ganimard\nwas there, with his revolver turned on Lupin. And behind Ganimard there\nwere twenty men, strong and ruthless fellows, who would beat him like a\ndog at the least sign of resistance.\n\n\"Hands down! I surrender!\" said Lupin, calmly; and he folded his arms\nacross his breast.\n\nEveryone was amazed. In the room, divested of its furniture and\nhangings, Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin's words sounded like an echo.... \"I surrender!\"\n... It seemed incredible. No one would have been astonished if he had\nsuddenly vanished through a trap, or if a section of the wall had rolled\naway and allowed him to escape. But he surrendered!\n\nGanimard advanced, nervously, and with all the gravity that the\nimportance of the occasion demanded, he placed his hand on the shoulder\nof his adversary, and had the infinite pleasure of saying:\n\n\"I arrest you, Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin.\"\n\n\"Brrr!\" said Lupin, \"you make me shiver, my dear Ganimard. What a\nlugubrious face! One would imagine you were speaking over the grave of\na friend. For Heaven's sake, don't assume such a funereal air.\"\n\n\"I arrest you.\"\n\n\"Don't let that worry you! In the name of the law, of which he is a\nwell-deserving pillar, Ganimard, the celebrated Parisian detective,\narrests the wicked Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin. An historic event, of which you will\nappreciate the true importance.... And it is the second time that it has\nhappened. Bravo, Ganimard, you are sure of advancement in your chosen\nprofession!\"\n\nAnd he held out his wrists for the hand-cuffs. Ganimard adjusted them in\na most solemn manner. The numerous policemen, despite their customary\npresumption and the bitterness of their feelings toward Lupin, conducted\nthemselves with becoming modesty, astonished at being permitted to gaze\nupon that mysterious and intangible creature.\n\n\"My poor Lupin,\" sighed our hero, \"what would your aristocratic friends\nsay if they should see you in this humiliating position?\"\n\nHe pulled his wrists apart with all his strength. The veins in his\nforehead expanded. The links of the chain cut into his flesh. The chain\nfell off--broken.\n\n\"Another, comrades, that one was useless.\"\n\nThey placed two on him this time.\n\n\"Quite right,\" he said. \"You cannot be too careful.\"\n\nThen, counting the detectives and policemen, he said:\n\n\"How many are you, my friends? Twenty-five? Thirty? That's too many. I\ncan't do anything. Ah! if there had been only fifteen!\"\n\nThere was something fascinating about Lupin; it was the fascination of\nthe great actor who plays his r\u00c3\u00b4le with spirit and understanding,\ncombined with assurance and ease. Sholmes regarded him as one might\nregard a beautiful painting with a due appreciation of all its\nperfection in coloring and technique. And he really thought that it was\nan equal struggle between those thirty men on one side, armed as they\nwere with all the strength and majesty of the law, and, on the other\nside, that solitary individual, unarmed and handcuffed. Yes, the two\nsides were well-matched.\n\n\"Well, master,\" said Lupin to the Englishman, \"this is your work. Thanks\nto you, Lupin is going to rot on the damp straw of a dungeon. Confess\nthat your conscience pricks you a little, and that your soul is filled\nwith remorse.\"\n\nIn spite of himself, Sholmes shrugged his shoulders, as if to say: \"It's\nyour own fault.\"\n\n\"Never! never!\" exclaimed Lupin. \"Give you the blue diamond? Oh! no, it\nhas cost me too much trouble. I intend to keep it. On my occasion of my\nfirst visit to you in London--which will probably be next month--I will\ntell you my reasons. But will you be in London next month? Or do you\nprefer Vienna? Or Saint Petersburg?\"\n\nThen Lupin received a surprise. A bell commenced to ring. It was not the\nalarm-bell, but the bell of the telephone which was located between the\ntwo windows of the room and had not yet been removed.\n\nThe telephone! Ah! Who could it be? Who was about to fall into this\nunfortunate trap? Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin exhibited an access of rage against the\nunlucky instrument as if he would like to break it into a thousand\npieces and thus stifle the mysterious voice that was calling for him.\nBut it was Ganimard who took down the receiver, and said:\n\n\"Hello!... Hello!... number 648.73 ... yes, this is it.\"\n\nThen Sholmes stepped up, and, with an air of authority, pushed Ganimard\naside, took the receiver, and covered the transmitter with his\nhandkerchief in order to obscure the tone of his voice. At that moment\nhe glanced toward Lupin, and the look which they exchanged indicated\nthat the same idea had occurred to each of them, and that they fore-saw\nthe ultimate result of that theory: it was the blonde Lady who was\ntelephoning. She wished to telephone to Felix Davey, or rather to Maxime\nBermond, and it was to Sholmes she was about to speak. The Englishman\nsaid:\n\n\"Hello ... Hello!\"\n\nThen, after a silence, he said:\n\n\"Yes, it is I, Maxime.\"\n\nThe drama had commenced and was progressing with tragic precision.\nLupin, the irrepressible and nonchalant Lupin, did not attempt to\nconceal his anxiety, and he strained every nerve in a desire to hear or,\nat least, to divine the purport of the conversation. And Sholmes\ncontinued, in reply to the mysterious voice:\n\n\"Hello!... Hello!... Yes, everything has been moved, and I am just\nready to leave here and meet you as we agreed.... Where?... Where you\nare now.... Don't believe that he is here yet!...\"\n\nSholmes stopped, seeking for words. It was clear that he was trying to\nquestion the girl without betraying himself, and that he was ignorant of\nher whereabouts. Moreover, Ganimard's presence seemed to embarrass\nhim.... Ah! if some miracle would only interrupt that cursed\nconversation! Lupin prayed for it with all his strength, with all the\nintensity of his incited nerves! After a momentary pause, Sholmes\ncontinued:\n\n\"Hello!... Hello!... Do you hear me?... I can't hear you very well....\nCan scarcely make out what you say.... Are you listening? Well, I think\nyou had better return home.... No danger now.... But he is in England! I\nhave received a telegram from Southampton announcing his arrival.\"\n\nThe sarcasm of those words! Sholmes uttered them with an inexpressible\ncomfort. And he added:\n\n\"Very well, don't lose any time. I will meet you there.\"\n\nHe hung up the receiver.\n\n\"Monsieur Ganimard, can you furnish me with three men?\"\n\n\"For the blonde Lady, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You know who she is, and where she is?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good! That settles Monsieur Lupin.... Folenfant, take two men, and go\nwith Monsieur Sholmes.\"\n\nThe Englishman departed, accompanied by the three men.\n\nThe game was ended. The blonde Lady was, also, about to fall into the\nhands of the Englishman. Thanks to his commendable persistence and to a\ncombination of fortuitous circumstances, the battle had resulted in a\nvictory for the detective, and in irreparable disaster for Lupin.\n\n\"Monsieur Sholmes!\"\n\nThe Englishman stopped.\n\n\"Monsieur Lupin?\"\n\nLupin was clearly shattered by this final blow. His forehead was marked\nby deep wrinkles. He was sullen and dejected. However, he pulled himself\ntogether, and, notwithstanding his defeat, he exclaimed, in a cheerful\ntone:\n\n\"You will concede that fate has been against me. A few minutes ago, it\nprevented my escape through that chimney, and delivered me into your\nhands. Now, by means of the telephone, it presents you with the blonde\nLady. I submit to its decrees.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that I am ready to re-open our negotiation.\"\n\nSholmes took Ganimard aside and asked, in a manner that did not permit a\nreply, the authority to exchange a few words with the prisoner. Then he\napproached Lupin, and said, in a sharp, nervous tone:\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle Destange's liberty.\"\n\n\"You know the price.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you accept?\"\n\n\"Yes; I accept your terms.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the Englishman, in surprise, \"but ... you refused ... for\nyourself----\"\n\n\"Yes, I can look out for myself, Monsieur Sholmes, but now the question\nconcerns a young woman ... and a woman I love. In France, understand, we\nhave very decided ideas about such things. And Lupin has the same\nfeelings as other people.\"\n\nHe spoke with simplicity and candor. Sholmes replied by an almost\nimperceptible inclination of his head, and murmured:\n\n\"Very well, the blue diamond.\"\n\n\"Take my cane, there, at the end of the mantel. Press on the head of the\ncane with one hand, and, with the other, turn the iron ferrule at the\nbottom.\"\n\nHolmes took the cane and followed the directions. As he did so, the head\nof the cane divided and disclosed a cavity which contained a small ball\nof wax which, in turn, enclosed a diamond. He examined it. It was the\nblue diamond.\n\n\"Monsieur Lupin, Mademoiselle Destange is free.\"\n\n\"Is her future safety assured? Has she nothing to fear from you?\"\n\n\"Neither from me, nor anyone else.\"\n\n\"How can you manage it?\"\n\n\"Quite easily. I have forgotten her name and address.\"\n\n\"Thank you. And au revoir--for I will see you again, sometime, Monsieur\nSholmes?\"\n\n\"I have no doubt of it.\"\n\nThen followed an animated conversation between Sholmes and Ganimard,\nwhich was abruptly terminated by the Englishman, who said:\n\n\"I am very sorry, Monsieur Ganimard, that we cannot agree on that point,\nbut I have no time to waste trying to convince you. I leave for England\nwithin an hour.\"\n\n\"But ... the blonde Lady?\"\n\n\"I do not know such a person.\"\n\n\"And yet, a moment ago----\"\n\n\"You must take the affair as it stands. I have delivered Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin\ninto your hands. Here is the blue diamond, which you will have the\npleasure of returning to the Countess de Crozon. What more do you want?\"\n\n\"The blonde Lady.\"\n\n\"Find her.\"\n\nSholmes pulled his cap down over his forehead and walked rapidly away,\nlike a man who is accustomed to go as soon as his business is finished.\n\n\"Bon voyage, monsieur,\" cried Lupin, \"and, believe me, I shall never\nforget the friendly way in which our little business affairs have been\narranged. My regards to Monsieur Wilson.\"\n\nNot receiving any reply, Lupin added, sneeringly:\n\n\"That is what is called 'taking British leave.' Ah! their insular\ndignity lacks the flower of courtesy by which we are distinguished.\nConsider for a moment, Ganimard, what a charming exit a Frenchman would\nhave made under similar circumstances! With what exquisite courtesy he\nwould have masked his triumph!... But, God bless me, Ganimard, what are\nyou doing? Making a search? Come, what's the use? There is nothing\nleft--not even a scrap of paper. I assure you my archives are in a safe\nplace.\"\n\n\"I am not so sure of that,\" replied Ganimard. \"I must search\neverything.\"\n\nLupin submitted to the operation. Held by two detectives and surrounded\nby the others, he patiently endured the proceedings for twenty minutes,\nthen he said:\n\n\"Hurry up, Ganimard, and finish!\"\n\n\"You are in a hurry.\"\n\n\"Of course I am. An important appointment.\"\n\n\"At the police station?\"\n\n\"No; in the city.\"\n\n\"Ah! at what time?\"\n\n\"Two o'clock.\"\n\n\"It is three o'clock now.\"\n\n\"Just so; I will be late. And punctuality is one of my virtues.\"\n\n\"Well, give me five minutes.\"\n\n\"Not a second more,\" said Lupin.\n\n\"I am doing my best to expedite----\"\n\n\"Oh! don't talk so much.... Still searching that cupboard? It is empty.\"\n\n\"Here are some letters.\"\n\n\"Old invoices, I presume!\"\n\n\"No; a packet tied with a ribbon.\"\n\n\"A red ribbon? Oh! Ganimard, for God's sake, don't untie it!\"\n\n\"From a woman?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"A woman of the world?\"\n\n\"The best in the world.\"\n\n\"Her name?\"\n\n\"Madame Ganimard.\"\n\n\"Very funny! very funny!\" exclaimed the detective.\n\nAt that moment the men, who had been sent to search the other rooms,\nreturned and announced their failure to find anything. Lupin laughed and\nsaid:\n\n\"Parbleu! Did you expect to find my visiting list, or evidence of my\nbusiness relations with the Emperor of Germany? But I can tell you what\nyou should investigate, Ganimard: All the little mysteries of this\napartment. For instance, that gas-pipe is a speaking tube. That chimney\ncontains a stairway. That wall is hollow. And the marvellous system of\nbells! Ah! Ganimard, just press that button!\"\n\nGanimard obeyed.\n\n\"Did you hear anything?\" asked Lupin.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Neither did I. And yet you notified my aeronaut to prepare the\ndirigible balloon which will soon carry us into the clouds.\n\n\"Come!\" said Ganimard, who had completed his search; \"we've had enough\nnonsense--let's be off.\"\n\nHe started away, followed by his men. Lupin did not move. His guardians\npushed him in vain.\n\n\"Well,\" said Ganimard, \"do you refuse to go?\"\n\n\"Not at all. But it depends.\"\n\n\"On what?\"\n\n\"Where you want to take me.\"\n\n\"To the station-house, of course.\"\n\n\"Then I refuse to go. I have no business there.\"\n\n\"Are you crazy?\"\n\n\"Did I not tell you that I had an important appointment?\"\n\n\"Lupin!\"\n\n\"Why, Ganimard, I have an appointment with the blonde Lady, and do you\nsuppose I would be so discourteous as to cause her a moment's anxiety?\nThat would be very ungentlemanly.\"\n\n\"Listen, Lupin,\" said the detective, who was becoming annoyed by this\npersiflage; \"I have been very patient with you, but I will endure no\nmore. Follow me.\"\n\n\"Impossible; I have an appointment and I shall keep it.\"\n\n\"For the last time--follow me!\"\n\n\"Im-pos-sible!\"\n\nAt a sign from Ganimard two men seized Lupin by the arms; but they\nreleased him at once, uttering cries of pain. Lupin had thrust two long\nneedles into them. The other men now rushed at Lupin with cries of rage\nand hatred, eager to avenge their comrades and to avenge themselves for\nthe many affronts he had heaped upon them; and now they struck and beat\nhim to their heart's desire. A violent blow on the temple felled Lupin\nto the floor.\n\n\"If you hurt him you will answer to me,\" growled Ganimard, in a rage.\n\nHe leaned over Lupin to ascertain his condition. Then, learning that he\nwas breathing freely, Ganimard ordered his men to carry the prisoner by\nthe head and feet, while he himself supported the body.\n\n\"Go gently, now!... Don't jolt him. Ah! the brutes would have killed\nhim.... Well, Lupin, how goes it?\"\n\n\"None too well, Ganimard ... you let them knock me out.\"\n\n\"It was your own fault; you were so obstinate,\" replied Ganimard. \"But I\nhope they didn't hurt you.\"\n\nThey had left the apartment and were now on the landing. Lupin groaned\nand stammered:\n\n\"Ganimard ... the elevator ... they are breaking my bones.\"\n\n\"A good idea, an excellent idea,\" replied Ganimard. \"Besides, the\nstairway is too narrow.\"\n\nHe summoned the elevator. They placed Lupin on the seat with the\ngreatest care. Ganimard took his place beside him and said to his men:\n\n\"Go down the stairs and wait for me below. Understand?\"\n\nGanimard closed the door of the elevator. Suddenly the elevator shot\nupward like a balloon released from its cable. Lupin burst into a fit of\nsardonic laughter.\n\n\"Good God!\" cried Ganimard, as he made a frantic search in the dark for\nthe button of descent. Having found it, he cried:\n\n\"The fifth floor! Watch the door of the fifth floor.\"\n\nHis assistants clambered up the stairs, two and three steps at a time.\nBut this strange circumstance happened: The elevator seemed to break\nthrough the ceiling of the last floor, disappeared from the sight of\nGanimard's assistants, suddenly made its appearance on the upper\nfloor--the servants' floor--and stopped. Three men were there waiting\nfor it. They opened the door. Two of them seized Ganimard, who,\nastonished at the sudden attack, scarcely made any defence. The other\nman carried off Lupin.\n\n\"I warned you, Ganimard ... about the dirigible balloon. Another time,\ndon't be so tender-hearted. And, moreover, remember that Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin\ndoesn't allow himself to be struck and knocked down without sufficient\nreason. Adieu.\"\n\nThe door of the elevator was already closed on Ganimard, and the machine\nbegan to descend; and it all happened so quickly that the old detective\nreached the ground floor as soon as his assistants. Without exchanging a\nword they crossed the court and ascended the servants' stairway, which\nwas the only way to reach the servants' floor through which the escape\nhad been made.\n\nA long corridor with several turns and bordered with little numbered\nrooms led to a door that was not locked. On the other side of this door\nand, therefore, in another house there was another corridor with similar\nturns and similar rooms, and at the end of it a servants' stairway.\nGanimard descended it, crossed a court and a vestibule and found himself\nin the rue Picot. Then he understood the situation: the two houses,\nbuilt the entire depth of the lots, touched at the rear, while the\nfronts of the houses faced upon two streets that ran parallel to each\nother at a distance of more than sixty metres apart.\n\nHe found the concierge and, showing his card, enquired:\n\n\"Did four men pass here just now?\"\n\n\"Yes; the two servants from the fourth and fifth floors, with two\nfriends.\"\n\n\"Who lives on the fourth and fifth floors?\"\n\n\"Two men named Fauvel and their cousins, whose name is Provost. They\nmoved to-day, leaving the two servants, who went away just now.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" thought Ganimard; \"what a grand opportunity we have missed! The\nentire band lived in these houses.\"\n\nAnd he sank down on a chair in despair.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nForty minutes later two gentlemen were driven up to the station of the\nNorthern Railway and hurried to the Calais express, followed by a porter\nwho carried their valises. One of them had his arm in a sling, and the\npallor of his face denoted some illness. The other man was in a jovial\nmood.\n\n\"We must hurry, Wilson, or we will miss the train.... Ah! Wilson, I\nshall never forget these ten days.\"\n\n\"Neither will I.\"\n\n\"Ah! it was a great struggle!\"\n\n\"Superb!\"\n\n\"A few repulses, here and there--\"\n\n\"Of no consequence.\"\n\n\"And, at last, victory all along the line. Lupin arrested! The blue\ndiamond recovered!\"\n\n\"My arm broken!\"\n\n\"What does a broken arm count for in such a victory as that?\"\n\n\"Especially when it is my arm.\"\n\n\"Ah! yes, don't you remember, Wilson, that it was at the very time you\nwere in the pharmacy, suffering like a hero, that I discovered the clue\nto the whole mystery?\"\n\n\"How lucky!\"\n\nThe doors of the carriages were being closed.\n\n\"All aboard. Hurry up, gentlemen!\"\n\nThe porter climbed into an empty compartment and placed their valises in\nthe rack, whilst Sholmes assisted the unfortunate Wilson.\n\n\"What's the matter, Wilson? You're not done up, are you? Come, pull your\nnerves together.\"\n\n\"My nerves are all right.\"\n\n\"Well, what is it, then?\"\n\n\"I have only one hand.\"\n\n\"What of it?\" exclaimed Sholmes, cheerfully. \"You are not the only one\nwho has had a broken arm. Cheer up!\"\n\nSholmes handed the porter a piece of fifty centimes.\n\n\"Thank you, Monsieur Sholmes,\" said the porter.\n\nThe Englishman looked at him; it was Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin.\n\n\"You!... you!\" he stammered, absolutely astounded.\n\nAnd Wilson brandished his sound arm in the manner of a man who\ndemonstrates a fact as he said:\n\n\"You! you! but you were arrested! Sholmes told me so. When he left you\nGanimard and thirty men had you in charge.\"\n\nLupin folded his arms and said, with an air of indignation:\n\n\"Did you suppose I would let you go away without bidding you adieu?\nAfter the very friendly relations that have always existed between us!\nThat would be discourteous and ungrateful on my part.\"\n\nThe train whistled. Lupin continued:\n\n\"I beg your pardon, but have you everything you need? Tobacco and\nmatches ... yes ... and the evening papers? You will find in them an\naccount of my arrest--your last exploit, Monsieur Sholmes. And now, au\nrevoir. Am delighted to have made your acquaintance. And if ever I can\nbe of any service to you, I shall be only too happy....\" He leaped to\nthe platform and closed the door.\n\n\"Adieu,\" he repeated, waving his handkerchief. \"Adieu.... I shall write\nto you.... You will write also, eh? And your arm broken, Wilson.... I am\ntruly sorry.... I shall expect to hear from both of you. A postal card,\nnow and then, simply address: Lupin, Paris. That is sufficient....\nAdieu.... See you soon.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nTHE JEWISH LAMP.\n\n\nHerlock Sholmes and Wilson were sitting in front of the fireplace, in\ncomfortable armchairs, with the feet extended toward the grateful warmth\nof a glowing coke fire.\n\nSholmes' pipe, a short brier with a silver band, had gone out. He\nknocked out the ashes, filled it, lighted it, pulled the skirts of his\ndressing-gown over his knees, and drew from his pipe great puffs of\nsmoke, which ascended toward the ceiling in scores of shadow rings.\n\nWilson gazed at him, as a dog lying curled up on a rug before the fire\nmight look at his master, with great round eyes which have no hope other\nthan to obey the least gesture of his owner. Was the master going to\nbreak the silence? Would he reveal to Wilson the subject of his reverie\nand admit his satellite into the charmed realm of his thoughts? When\nSholmes had maintained his silent attitude for some time. Wilson\nventured to speak:\n\n\"Everything seems quiet now. Not the shadow of a case to occupy our\nleisure moments.\"\n\nSholmes did not reply, but the rings of smoke emitted by Sholmes were\nbetter formed, and Wilson observed that his companion drew considerable\npleasure from that trifling fact--an indication that the great man was\nnot absorbed in any serious meditation. Wilson, discouraged, arose and\nwent to the window.\n\nThe lonely street extended between the gloomy fa\u00c3\u00a7ades of grimy houses,\nunusually gloomy this morning by reason of a heavy downfall of rain. A\ncab passed; then another. Wilson made an entry of their numbers in his\nmemorandum-book. One never knows!\n\n\"Ah!\" he exclaimed, \"the postman.\"\n\nThe man entered, shown in by the servant.\n\n\"Two registered letters, sir ... if you will sign, please?\"\n\nSholmes signed the receipts, accompanied the man to the door, and was\nopening one of the letters as he returned.\n\n\"It seems to please you,\" remarked Wilson, after a moment's silence.\n\n\"This letter contains a very interesting proposition. You are anxious\nfor a case--here's one. Read----\"\n\nWilson read:\n\n     \"Monsieur,\n\n     \"I desire the benefit of your services and experience. I have been\n     the victim of a serious theft, and the investigation has as yet\n     been unsuccessful. I am sending to you by this mail a number of\n     newspapers which will inform you of the affair, and if you will\n     undertake the case, I will place my house at your disposal and ask\n     you to fill in the enclosed check, signed by me, for whatever sum\n     you require for your expenses.\n\n     \"Kindly reply by telegraph, and much oblige,\n\n     \"Your humble servant,\n\n     \"Baron Victor d'Imblevalle,\n\n     \"18 rue Murillo, Paris.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Sholmes, \"that sounds good ... a little trip to Paris\n... and why not, Wilson? Since my famous duel with Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin, I have\nnot had an excuse to go there. I should be pleased to visit the capital\nof the world under less strenuous conditions.\"\n\nHe tore the check into four pieces and, while Wilson, whose arm had not\nyet regained its former strength, uttered bitter words against Paris and\nthe Parisians, Sholmes opened the second envelope. Immediately, he made\na gesture of annoyance, and a wrinkle appeared on his forehead during\nthe reading of the letter; then, crushing the paper into a ball, he\nthrew it, angrily, on the floor.\n\n\"Well? What's the matter?\" asked Wilson, anxiously.\n\nHe picked up the ball of paper, unfolded it, and read, with increasing\namazement:\n\n     \"My Dear Monsieur:\n\n     \"You know full well the admiration I have for you and the interest\n     I take in your renown. Well, believe me, when I warn you to have\n     nothing whatever to do with the case on which you have just now\n     been called to Paris. Your intervention will cause much harm; your\n     efforts will produce a most lamentable result; and you will be\n     obliged to make a public confession of your defeat.\n\n     \"Having a sincere desire to spare you such humiliation, I implore\n     you, in the name of the friendship that unites us, to remain\n     peacefully reposing at your own fireside.\n\n     \"My best wishes to Monsieur Wilson, and, for yourself, the sincere\n     regards of your devoted ARS\u00c3\u0088NE LUPIN.\"\n\n\"Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin!\" repeated Wilson, astounded.\n\nSholmes struck the table with his fist, and exclaimed:\n\n\"Ah! he is pestering me already, the fool! He laughs at me as if I were\na schoolboy! The public confession of my defeat! Didn't I force him to\ndisgorge the blue diamond?\"\n\n\"I tell you--he's afraid,\" suggested Wilson.\n\n\"Nonsense! Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin is not afraid, and this taunting letter proves\nit.\"\n\n\"But how did he know that the Baron d'Imblevalle had written to you?\"\n\n\"What do I know about it? You do ask some stupid questions, my boy.\"\n\n\"I thought ... I supposed----\"\n\n\"What? That I am a clairvoyant? Or a sorcerer?\"\n\n\"No, but I have seen you do some marvellous things.\"\n\n\"No person can perform _marvellous_ things. I no more than you. I\nreflect, I deduct, I conclude--that is all; but I do not divine. Only\nfools divine.\"\n\nWilson assumed the attitude of a whipped cur, and resolved not to make a\nfool of himself by trying to divine why Sholmes paced the room with\nquick, nervous strides. But when Sholmes rang for the servant and\nordered his valise, Wilson thought that he was in possession of a\nmaterial fact which gave him the right to reflect, deduct and conclude\nthat his associate was about to take a journey. The same mental\noperation permitted him to assert, with almost mathematical exactness:\n\n\"Sholmes, you are going to Paris.\"\n\n\"Possibly.\"\n\n\"And Lupin's affront impels you to go, rather than the desire to assist\nthe Baron d'Imblevalle.\"\n\n\"Possibly.\"\n\n\"Sholmes, I shall go with you.\"\n\n\"Ah; ah! my old friend,\" exclaimed Sholmes, interrupting his walking,\n\"you are not afraid that your right arm will meet the same fate as your\nleft?\"\n\n\"What can happen to me? You will be there.\"\n\n\"That's the way to talk, Wilson. We will show that clever Frenchman that\nhe made a mistake when he threw his glove in our faces. Be quick,\nWilson, we must catch the first train.\"\n\n\"Without waiting for the papers the baron has sent you?\"\n\n\"What good are they?\"\n\n\"I will send a telegram.\"\n\n\"No; if you do that, Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin will know of my arrival. I wish to\navoid that. This time, Wilson, we must fight under cover.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat afternoon, the two friends embarked at Dover. The passage was a\ndelightful one. In the train from Calais to Paris, Sholmes had three\nhours sound sleep, while Wilson guarded the door of the compartment.\n\nSholmes awoke in good spirits. He was delighted at the idea of another\nduel with Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin, and he rubbed his hands with the satisfied air\nof a man who looks forward to a pleasant vacation.\n\n\"At last!\" exclaimed Wilson, \"we are getting to work again.\"\n\nAnd he rubbed his hands with the same satisfied air.\n\nAt the station, Sholmes took the wraps and, followed by Wilson, who\ncarried the valises, he gave up his tickets and started off briskly.\n\n\"Fine weather, Wilson.... Blue sky and sunshine! Paris is giving us a\nroyal reception.\"\n\n\"Yes, but what a crowd!\"\n\n\"So much the better, Wilson, we will pass unnoticed. No one will\nrecognize us in such a crowd.\"\n\n\"Is this Monsieur Sholmes?\"\n\nHe stopped, somewhat puzzled. Who the deuce could thus address him by\nhis name? A woman stood beside him; a young girl whose simple dress\noutlined her slender form and whose pretty face had a sad and anxious\nexpression. She repeated her enquiry:\n\n\"You are Monsieur Sholmes?\"\n\nAs he still remained silent, as much from confusion as from a habit of\nprudence, the girl asked a third time:\n\n\"Have I the honor of addressing Monsieur Sholmes?\"\n\n\"What do you want?\" he replied, testily, considering the incident a\nsuspicious one.\n\n\"You must listen to me, Monsieur Sholmes, as it is a serious matter. I\nknow that you are going to the rue Murillo.\"\n\n\"What do you say?\"\n\n\"I know ... I know ... rue Murillo ... number 18. Well, you must not go\n... no, you must not. I assure you that you will regret it. Do not think\nthat I have any interest in the matter. I do it because it is right ...\nbecause my conscience tells me to do it.\"\n\nSholmes tried to get away, but she persisted:\n\n\"Oh! I beg of you, don't neglect my advice.... Ah! if I only knew how to\nconvince you! Look at me! Look into my eyes! They are sincere ... they\nspeak the truth.\"\n\nShe gazed at Sholmes, fearlessly but innocently, with those beautiful\neyes, serious and clear, in which her very soul seemed to be reflected.\n\nWilson nodded his head, as he said:\n\n\"Mademoiselle looks honest.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she implored, \"and you must have confidence----\"\n\n\"I have confidence in you, mademoiselle,\" replied Wilson.\n\n\"Oh, how happy you make me! And so has your friend? I feel it ... I am\nsure of it! What happiness! Everything will be all right now!... What a\ngood idea of mine!... Ah! yes, there is a train for Calais in twenty\nminutes. You will take it.... Quick, follow me ... you must come this\nway ... there is just time.\"\n\nShe tried to drag them along. Sholmes seized her arm, and in as gentle a\nvoice as he could assume, said to her:\n\n\"Excuse me, mademoiselle, if I cannot yield to your wishes, but I never\nabandon a task that I have once undertaken.\"\n\n\"I beseech you ... I implore you.... Ah if you could only understand!\"\n\nSholmes passed outside and walked away at a quick pace. Wilson said to\nthe girl:\n\n\"Have no fear ... he will be in at the finish. He never failed yet.\"\n\nAnd he ran to overtake Sholmes.\n\nHERLOCK SHOLMES--ARS\u00c3\u0088NE LUPIN.\n\nThese words, in great black letters, met their gaze as soon as they left\nthe railway station. A number of sandwich-men were parading through the\nstreet, one behind the other, carrying heavy canes with iron ferrules\nwith which they struck the pavement in harmony, and, on their backs,\nthey carried large posters, on which one could read the following\nnotice:\n\nTHE MATCH BETWEEN HERLOCK SHOLMES\nAND ARS\u00c3\u0088NE LUPIN. ARRIVAL OF THE ENGLISH\nCHAMPION. THE GREAT DETECTIVE ATTACKS\nTHE MYSTERY OF THE RUE MURILLO. READ THE\nDETAILS IN THE \"ECHO DE FRANCE\".\n\nWilson shook his head, and said:\n\n\"Look at that, Sholmes, and we thought we were traveling incognito! I\nshouldn't be surprised to find the republican guard waiting for us at\nthe rue Murillo to give us an official reception with toasts and\nchampagne.\"\n\n\"Wilson, when you get funny, you get beastly funny,\" growled Sholmes.\n\nThen he approached one of the sandwich-men with the obvious intention of\nseizing him in his powerful grip and crushing him, together with his\ninfernal sign-board. There was quite a crowd gathered about the men,\nreading the notices, and joking and laughing.\n\nRepressing a furious access of rage, Sholmes said to the man:\n\n\"When did they hire you?\"\n\n\"This morning.\"\n\n\"How long have you been parading?\"\n\n\"About an hour.\"\n\n\"But the boards were ready before that?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, they were ready when we went to the agency this morning.\"\n\nSo then it appears that Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin had foreseen that he, Sholmes,\nwould accept the challenge. More than that, the letter written by Lupin\nshowed that he was eager for the fray and that he was prepared to\nmeasure swords once more with his formidable rival. Why? What motive\ncould Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin have in renewing the struggle?\n\nSholmes hesitated for a moment. Lupin must be very confident of his\nsuccess to show so much insolence in advance; and was not he, Sholmes,\nfalling into a trap by rushing into the battle at the first call for\nhelp?\n\nHowever, he called a carriage.\n\n\"Come, Wilson!... Driver, 18 rue Murillo!\" he exclaimed, with an\noutburst of his accustomed energy. With distended veins and clenched\nfists, as if he were about to engage in a boxing bout, he jumped into\nthe carriage.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rue Murillo is bordered with magnificent private residences, the\nrear of which overlook the Parc Monceau. One of the most pretentious of\nthese houses is number 18, owned and occupied by the Baron d'Imblevalle\nand furnished in a luxurious manner consistent with the owner's taste\nand wealth. There was a courtyard in front of the house, and, in the\nrear, a garden well filled with trees whose branches mingle with those\nof the park.\n\nAfter ringing the bell, the two Englishmen were admitted, crossed the\ncourtyard, and were received at the door by a footman who showed them\ninto a small parlor facing the garden in the rear of the house. They sat\ndown and, glancing about, made a rapid inspection of the many valuable\nobjects with which the room was filled.\n\n\"Everything very choice,\" murmured Wilson, \"and in the best of taste. It\nis a safe deduction to make that those who had the leisure to collect\nthese articles must now be at least fifty years of age.\"\n\nThe door opened, and the Baron d'Imblevalle entered, followed by his\nwife. Contrary to the deduction made by Wilson, they were both quite\nyoung, of elegant appearance, and vivacious in speech and action. They\nwere profuse in their expressions of gratitude.\n\n\"So kind of you to come! Sorry to have caused you so much trouble! The\ntheft now seems of little consequence, since it has procured us this\npleasure.\"\n\n\"How charming these French people are!\" thought Wilson, evolving one of\nhis commonplace deductions.\n\n\"But time is money,\" exclaimed the baron, \"especially your time,\nMonsieur Sholmes. So I will come to the point. Now, what do you think of\nthe affair? Do you think you can succeed in it?\"\n\n\"Before I can answer that I must know what it is about.\"\n\n\"I thought you knew.\"\n\n\"No; so I must ask you for full particulars, even to the smallest\ndetail. First, what is the nature of the case?\"\n\n\"A theft.\"\n\n\"When did it take place?\"\n\n\"Last Saturday,\" replied the baron, \"or, at least, some time during\nSaturday night or Sunday morning.\"\n\n\"That was six days ago. Now, you can tell me all about it.\"\n\n\"In the first place, monsieur, I must tell you that my wife and I,\nconforming to the manner of life that our position demands, go out very\nlittle. The education of our children, a few receptions, and the care\nand decoration of our house--such constitutes our life; and nearly all\nour evenings are spent in this little room, which is my wife's boudoir,\nand in which we have gathered a few artistic objects. Last Saturday\nnight, about eleven o'clock, I turned off the electric lights, and my\nwife and I retired, as usual, to our room.\"\n\n\"Where is your room?\"\n\n\"It adjoins this. That is the door. Next morning, that is to say, Sunday\nmorning, I arose quite early. As Suzanne, my wife, was still asleep, I\npassed into the boudoir as quietly as possible so as not to wake her.\nWhat was my astonishment when I found that window open--as we had left\nit closed the evening before!\"\n\n\"A servant----\"\n\n\"No one enters here in the morning until we ring. Besides, I always take\nthe precaution to bolt the second door which communicates with the\nante-chamber. Therefore, the window must have been opened from the\noutside. Besides, I have some evidence of that: the second pane of glass\nfrom the right--close to the fastening--had been cut.\"\n\n\"And what does that window overlook?\"\n\n\"As you can see for yourself, it opens on a little balcony, surrounded\nby a stone railing. Here, we are on the first floor, and you can see the\ngarden behind the house and the iron fence which separates it from the\nParc Monceau. It is quite certain that the thief came through the park,\nclimbed the fence by the aid of a ladder, and thus reached the terrace\nbelow the window.\"\n\n\"That is quite certain, you say!\"\n\n\"Well, in the soft earth on either side of the fence, they found the two\nholes made by the bottom of the ladder, and two similar holes can be\nseen below the window. And the stone railing of the balcony shows two\nscratches which were doubtless made by the contact of the ladder.\"\n\n\"Is the Parc Monceau closed at night?\"\n\n\"No; but if it were, there is a house in course of erection at number\n14, and a person could enter that way.\"\n\nHerlock Sholmes reflected for a few minutes, and then said:\n\n\"Let us come down to the theft. It must have been committed in this\nroom?\"\n\n\"Yes; there was here, between that twelfth century Virgin and that\ntabernacle of chased silver, a small Jewish lamp. It has disappeared.\"\n\n\"And is that all?\"\n\n\"That is all.\"\n\n\"Ah!... And what is a Jewish lamp?\"\n\n\"One of those copper lamps used by the ancient Jews, consisting of a\nstandard which supported a bowl containing the oil, and from this bowl\nprojected several burners intended for the wicks.\"\n\n\"Upon the whole, an object of small value.\"\n\n\"No great value, of course. But this one contained a secret hiding-place\nin which we were accustomed to place a magnificent jewel, a chimera in\ngold, set with rubies and emeralds, which was of great value.\"\n\n\"Why did you hide it there?\"\n\n\"Oh! I can't give any reason, monsieur, unless it was an odd fancy to\nutilize a hiding-place of that kind.\"\n\n\"Did anyone know it?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"No one--except the thief,\" said Sholmes. \"Otherwise he would not have\ntaken the trouble to steal the lamp.\"\n\n\"Of course. But how could he know it, as it was only by accident that\nthe secret mechanism of the lamp was revealed to us.\"\n\n\"A similar accident has revealed it to some one else ... a servant ...\nor an acquaintance. But let us proceed: I suppose the police have been\nnotified?\"\n\n\"Yes. The examining magistrate has completed his investigation. The\nreporter-detectives attached to the leading newspapers have also made\ntheir investigations. But, as I wrote to you, it seems to me the mystery\nwill never be solved.\"\n\nSholmes arose, went to the window, examined the casement, the balcony,\nthe terrace, studied the scratches on the stone railing with his\nmagnifying-glass, and then requested Mon. d'Imblevalle to show him the\ngarden.\n\nOutside, Sholmes sat down in a rattan chair and gazed at the roof of the\nhouse in a dreamy way. Then he walked over to the two little wooden\nboxes with which they had covered the holes made in the ground by the\nbottom of the ladder with a view of preserving them intact. He raised\nthe boxes, kneeled on the ground, scrutinized the holes and made some\nmeasurements. After making a similar examination of the holes near the\nfence, he and the baron returned to the boudoir where Madame\nd'Imblevalle was waiting for them. After a short silence Sholmes said:\n\n\"At the very outset of your story, baron, I was surprised at the very\nsimple methods employed by the thief. To raise a ladder, cut a\nwindow-pane, select a valuable article, and walk out again--no, that is\nnot the way such things are done. All that is too plain, too simple.\"\n\n\"Well, what do you think?\"\n\n\"That the Jewish lamp was stolen under the direction of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin.\"\n\n\"Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin!\" exclaimed the baron.\n\n\"Yes, but he did not do it himself, as no one came from the outside.\nPerhaps a servant descended from the upper floor by means of a\nwaterspout that I noticed when I was in the garden.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so?\"\n\n\"Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin would not leave this room empty-handed.\"\n\n\"Empty-handed! But he had the lamp.\"\n\n\"But that would not have prevented his taking that snuff-box, set with\ndiamonds, or that opal necklace. When he leaves anything, it is because\nhe can't carry it away.\"\n\n\"But the marks of the ladder outside?\"\n\n\"A false scent. Placed there simply to avert suspicion.\"\n\n\"And the scratches on the balustrade?\"\n\n\"A farce! They were made with a piece of sandpaper. See, here are scraps\nof the paper that I picked up in the garden.\"\n\n\"And what about the marks made by the bottom of the ladder?\"\n\n\"Counterfeit! Examine the two rectangular holes below the window, and\nthe two holes near the fence. They are of a similar form, but I find\nthat the two holes near the house are closer to each other than the two\nholes near the fence. What does that fact suggest? To me, it suggested\nthat the four holes were made by a piece of wood prepared for the\npurpose.\"\n\n\"The better proof would be the piece of wood itself.\"\n\n\"Here it is,\" said Sholmes, \"I found it in the garden, under the box of\na laurel tree.\"\n\nThe baron bowed to Sholmes in recognition of his skill. Only forty\nminutes had elapsed since the Englishman had entered the house, and he\nhad already exploded all the theories theretofore formed, and which had\nbeen based on what appeared to be obvious and undeniable facts. But what\nnow appeared to be the real facts of the case rested upon a more solid\nfoundation, to-wit, the astute reasoning of a Herlock Sholmes.\n\n\"The accusation which you make against one of our household is a very\nserious matter,\" said the baroness. \"Our servants have been with us a\nlong time and none of them would betray our trust.\"\n\n\"If none of them has betrayed you, how can you explain the fact that I\nreceived this letter on the same day and by the same mail as the letter\nyou wrote to me?\"\n\nHe handed to the baroness the letter that he had received from Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne\nLupin. She exclaimed, in amazement:\n\n\"Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin! How could he know?\"\n\n\"Did you tell anyone that you had written to me?\"\n\n\"No one,\" replied the baron. \"The idea occurred to us the other evening\nat the dinner-table.\"\n\n\"Before the servants?\"\n\n\"No, only our two children. Oh, no ... Sophie and Henriette had left the\ntable, hadn't they, Suzanne?\"\n\nMadame d'Imblevalle, after a moment's reflection, replied:\n\n\"Yes, they had gone to Mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle?\" queried Sholmes.\n\n\"The governess, Mademoiselle Alice Demun.\"\n\n\"Does she take her meals with you?\"\n\n\"No. Her meals are served in her room.\"\n\nWilson had an idea. He said:\n\n\"The letter written to my friend Herlock Sholmes was posted?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Who posted it?\"\n\n\"Dominique, who has been my valet for twenty years,\" replied the baron.\n\"Any search in that direction would be a waste of time.\"\n\n\"One never wastes his time when engaged in a search,\" said Wilson,\nsententiously.\n\nThis preliminary investigation now ended, and Sholmes asked permission\nto retire.\n\nAt dinner, an hour later, he saw Sophie and Henriette, the two children\nof the family, one was six and the other eight years of age. There was\nvery little conversation at the table. Sholmes responded to the friendly\nadvances of his hosts in such a curt manner that they were soon reduced\nto silence. When the coffee was served, Sholmes swallowed the contents\nof his cup, and rose to take his leave.\n\nAt that moment, a servant entered with a telephone message addressed to\nSholmes. He opened it, and read:\n\n     \"You have my enthusiastic admiration. The results attained by you\n     in so short a time are simply marvellous. I am dismayed.\n\n     \"ARS\u00c3\u0088NE LUPIN.\"\n\nSholmes made a gesture of indignation and handed the message to the\nbaron, saying:\n\n\"What do you think now, monsieur? Are the walls of your house furnished\nwith eyes and ears?\"\n\n\"I don't understand it,\" said the baron, in amazement.\n\n\"Nor do I; but I do understand that Lupin has knowledge of everything\nthat occurs in this house. He knows every movement, every word. There is\nno doubt of it. But how does he get his information? That is the first\nmystery I have to solve, and when I know that I will know everything.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat night, Wilson retired with the clear conscience of a man who has\nperformed his whole duty and thus acquired an undoubted right to sleep\nand repose. So he fell asleep very quickly, and was soon enjoying the\nmost delightful dreams in which he pursued Lupin and captured him\nsingle-handed; and the sensation was so vivid and exciting that it woke\nhim from his sleep. Someone was standing at his bedside. He seized his\nrevolver, and cried:\n\n\"Don't move, Lupin, or I'll fire.\"\n\n\"The deuce! Wilson, what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Oh! it is you, Sholmes. Do you want me?\"\n\n\"I want to show you something. Get up.\"\n\nSholmes led him to the window, and said:\n\n\"Look!... on the other side of the fence....\"\n\n\"In the park?\"\n\n\"Yes. What do you see?\"\n\n\"I don't see anything.\"\n\n\"Yes, you do see something.\"\n\n\"Ah! of course, a shadow ... two of them.\"\n\n\"Yes, close to the fence. See, they are moving. Come, quick!\"\n\nQuickly they descended the stairs, and reached a room which opened into\nthe garden. Through the glass door they could see the two shadowy forms\nin the same place.\n\n\"It is very strange,\" said Sholmes, \"but it seems to me I can hear a\nnoise inside the house.\"\n\n\"Inside the house? Impossible! Everybody is asleep.\"\n\n\"Well, listen----\"\n\nAt that moment a low whistle came from the other side of the fence, and\nthey perceived a dim light which appeared to come from the house.\n\n\"The baron must have turned on the light in his room. It is just above\nus.\"\n\n\"That must have been the noise you heard,\" said Wilson. \"Perhaps they\nare watching the fence also.\"\n\nThen there was a second whistle, softer than before.\n\n\"I don't understand it; I don't understand,\" said Sholmes, irritably.\n\n\"No more do I,\" confessed Wilson.\n\nSholmes turned the key, drew the bolt, and quietly opened the door. A\nthird whistle, louder than before, and modulated to another form. And\nthe noise above their heads became more pronounced. Sholmes said:\n\n\"It seems to be on the balcony outside the boudoir window.\"\n\nHe put his head through the half-opened door, but immediately recoiled,\nwith a stifled oath. Then Wilson looked. Quite close to them there was a\nladder, the upper end of which was resting on the balcony.\n\n\"The deuce!\" said Sholmes, \"there is someone in the boudoir. That is\nwhat we heard. Quick, let us remove the ladder.\"\n\nBut at that instant a man slid down the ladder and ran toward the spot\nwhere his accomplices were waiting for him outside the fence. He\ncarried the ladder with him. Sholmes and Wilson pursued the man and\novertook him just as he was placing the ladder against the fence. From\nthe other side of the fence two shots were fired.\n\n\"Wounded?\" cried Sholmes.\n\n\"No,\" replied Wilson.\n\nWilson seized the man by the body and tried to hold him, but the man\nturned and plunged a knife into Wilson's breast. He uttered a groan,\nstaggered and fell.\n\n\"Damnation!\" muttered Sholmes, \"if they have killed him I will kill\nthem.\"\n\nHe laid Wilson on the grass and rushed toward the ladder. Too late--the\nman had climbed the fence and, accompanied by his confederates, had fled\nthrough the bushes.\n\n\"Wilson, Wilson, it is not serious, hein? Merely a scratch.\"\n\nThe house door opened, and Monsieur d'Imblevalle appeared, followed by\nthe servants, carrying candles.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked the baron. \"Is Monsieur Wilson wounded?\"\n\n\"Oh! it's nothing--a mere scratch,\" repeated Sholmes, trying to deceive\nhimself.\n\nThe blood was flowing profusely, and Wilson's face was livid. Twenty\nminutes later the doctor ascertained that the point of the knife had\npenetrated to within an inch and a half of the heart.\n\n\"An inch and a half of the heart! Wilson always was lucky!\" said\nSholmes, in an envious tone.\n\n\"Lucky ... lucky....\" muttered the doctor.\n\n\"Of course! Why, with his robust constitution he will soon be out\nagain.\"\n\n\"Six weeks in bed and two months of convalescence.\"\n\n\"Not more?\"\n\n\"No, unless complications set in.\"\n\n\"Oh! the devil! what does he want complications for?\"\n\nFully reassured, Sholmes joined the baron in the boudoir. This time the\nmysterious visitor had not exercised the same restraint. Ruthlessly, he\nhad laid his vicious hand upon the diamond snuff-box, upon the opal\nnecklace, and, in a general way, upon everything that could find a place\nin the greedy pockets of an enterprising burglar.\n\nThe window was still open; one of the window-panes had been neatly cut;\nand, in the morning, a summary investigation showed that the ladder\nbelonged to the house then in course of construction.\n\n\"Now, you can see,\" said Mon. d'Imblevalle, with a touch of irony, \"it\nis an exact repetition of the affair of the Jewish lamp.\"\n\n\"Yes, if we accept the first theory adopted by the police.\"\n\n\"Haven't you adopted it yet? Doesn't this second theft shatter your\ntheory in regard to the first?\"\n\n\"It only confirms it, monsieur.\"\n\n\"That is incredible! You have positive evidence that last night's theft\nwas committed by an outsider, and yet you adhere to your theory that the\nJewish lamp was stolen by someone in the house.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"How do you explain it?\"\n\n\"I do not explain anything, monsieur; I have established two facts which\ndo not appear to have any relation to each other, and yet I am seeking\nthe missing link that connects them.\"\n\nHis conviction seemed to be so earnest and positive that the baron\nsubmitted to it, and said:\n\n\"Very well, we will notify the police----\"\n\n\"Not at all!\" exclaimed the Englishman, quickly, \"not at all! I intend\nto ask for their assistance when I need it--but not before.\"\n\n\"But the attack on your friend?\"\n\n\"That's of no consequence. He is only wounded. Secure the license of the\ndoctor. I shall be responsible for the legal side of the affair.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next two days proved uneventful. Yet Sholmes was investigating the\ncase with a minute care, and with a sense of wounded pride resulting\nfrom that audacious theft, committed under his nose, in spite of his\npresence and beyond his power to prevent it. He made a thorough\ninvestigation of the house and garden, interviewed the servants, and\npaid lengthy visits to the kitchen and stables. And, although his\nefforts were fruitless, he did not despair.\n\n\"I will succeed,\" he thought, \"and the solution must be sought within\nthe walls of this house. This affair is quite different from that of the\nblonde Lady, where I had to work in the dark, on unknown ground. This\ntime I am on the battlefield itself. The enemy is not the elusive and\ninvisible Lupin, but the accomplice, in flesh and blood, who lives and\nmoves within the confines of this house. Let me secure the slightest\nclue and the game is mine!\"\n\nThat clue was furnished to him by accident.\n\nOn the afternoon of the third day, when he entered a room located above\nthe boudoir, which served as a study for the children, he found\nHenriette, the younger of the two sisters. She was looking for her\nscissors.\n\n\"You know,\" she said to Sholmes, \"I make papers like that you received\nthe other evening.\"\n\n\"The other evening?\"\n\n\"Yes, just as dinner was over, you received a paper with marks on it ...\nyou know, a telegram.... Well, I make them, too.\"\n\nShe left the room. To anyone else these words would seem to be nothing\nmore than the insignificant remark of a child, and Sholmes himself\nlistened to them with a distracted air and continued his investigation.\nBut, suddenly, he ran after the child, and overtook her at the head of\nthe stairs. He said to her:\n\n\"So you paste stamps and marks on papers?\"\n\nHenriette, very proudly, replied:\n\n\"Yes, I cut them out and paste them on.\"\n\n\"Who taught you that little game?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle ... my governess ... I have seen her do it often. She\ntakes words out of the newspapers and pastes them----\"\n\n\"What does she make out of them?\"\n\n\"Telegrams and letters that she sends away.\"\n\nHerlock Sholmes returned to the study, greatly puzzled by the\ninformation and seeking to draw from it a logical deduction. There was a\npile of newspapers on the mantel. He opened them and found that many\nwords and, in some places, entire lines had been cut out. But, after\nreading a few of the word's which preceded or followed, he decided that\nthe missing words had been cut out at random--probably by the child. It\nwas possible that one of the newspapers had been cut by mademoiselle;\nbut how could he assure himself that such was the case?\n\nMechanically, Sholmes turned over the school-books on the table; then\nothers which were lying on the shelf of a bookcase. Suddenly he uttered\na cry of joy. In a corner of the bookcase, under a pile of old exercise\nbooks, he found a child's alphabet-book, in which the letters were\nornamented with pictures, and on one of the pages of that book he\ndiscovered a place where a word had been removed. He examined it. It\nwas a list of the days of the week. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc. The\nword \"Saturday\" was missing. Now, the theft of the Jewish lamp had\noccurred on a Saturday night.\n\nSholmes experienced that slight fluttering of the heart which always\nannounced to him, in the clearest manner, that he had discovered the\nroad which leads to victory. That ray of truth, that feeling of\ncertainty, never deceived him.\n\nWith nervous fingers he hastened to examine the balance of the book.\nVery soon he made another discovery. It was a page composed of capital\nletters, followed by a line of figures. Nine of those letters and three\nof those figures had been carefully cut out. Sholmes made a list of the\nmissing letters and figures in his memorandum book, in alphabetical and\nnumerical order, and obtained the following result:\n\nCDEHNOPEZ--237.\n\n\"Well? at first sight, it is a rather formidable puzzle,\" he murmured,\n\"but, by transposing the letters and using all of them, is it possible\nto form one, two or three complete words?\"\n\nSholmes tried it, in vain.\n\nOnly one solution seemed possible; it constantly appeared before him, no\nmatter which way he tried to juggle the letters, until, at length, he\nwas satisfied it was the true solution, since it harmonized with the\nlogic of the facts and the general circumstances of the case.\n\nAs that page of the book did not contain any duplicate letters it was\nprobable, in fact quite certain, that the words he could form from those\nletters would be incomplete, and that the original words had been\ncompleted with letters taken from other pages. Under those conditions he\nobtained the following solution, errors and omissions excepted:\n\nREPOND Z--CH--237.\n\nThe first word was quite clear: r\u00c3\u00a9pondez [reply], a letter E is missing\nbecause it occurs twice in the word, and the book furnished only one\nletter of each kind.\n\nAs to the second incomplete word, no doubt it formed, with the aid of\nthe number 237, an address to which the reply was to be sent. They\nappointed Saturday as the time, and requested a reply to be sent to the\naddress CH. 237.\n\nOr, perhaps, CH. 237 was an address for a letter to be sent to the\n\"general delivery\" of some postoffice, or, again, they might form a\npart of some incomplete word. Sholmes searched the book once more, but\ndid not discover that any other letters had been removed. Therefore,\nuntil further orders, he decided to adhere to the foregoing\ninterpretation.\n\nHenriette returned and observed what he was doing.\n\n\"Amusing, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, very amusing,\" he replied. \"But, have you any other papers?... Or,\nrather, words already cut out that I can paste?\"\n\n\"Papers?... No.... And Mademoiselle wouldn't like it.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle?\"\n\n\"Yes, she has scolded me already.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I have told you some things ... and she says that a person\nshould never tell things about those they love.\"\n\n\"You are quite right.\"\n\nHenriette was delighted to receive his approbation, in fact so highly\npleased that she took from a little silk bag that was pinned to her\ndress some scraps of cloth, three buttons, two cubes of sugar and,\nlastly, a piece of paper which she handed to Sholmes.\n\n\"See, I give it to you just the same.\"\n\nIt was the number of a cab--8,279.\n\n\"Where did this number come from?\"\n\n\"It fell out of her pocketbook.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Sunday, at mass, when she was taking out some sous for the collection.\"\n\n\"Exactly! And now I shall tell you how to keep from being scolded again.\nDo not tell Mademoiselle that you saw me.\"\n\nSholmes then went to Mon. d'Imblevalle and questioned him in regard to\nMademoiselle. The baron replied, indignantly:\n\n\"Alice Demun! How can you imagine such a thing? It is utterly\nimpossible!\"\n\n\"How long has she been in your service?\"\n\n\"Only a year, but there is no one in the house in whom I have greater\nconfidence.\"\n\n\"Why have I not seen her yet?\"\n\n\"She has been away for a few days.\"\n\n\"But she is here now.\"\n\n\"Yes; since her return she has been watching at the bedside of your\nfriend. She has all the qualities of a nurse ... gentle ... thoughtful\n... Monsieur Wilson seems much pleased....\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Sholmes, who had completely neglected to inquire about his\nfriend. After a moment's reflection he asked:\n\n\"Did she go out on Sunday morning?\"\n\n\"The day after the theft?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe baron called his wife and asked her. She replied:\n\n\"Mademoiselle went to the eleven o'clock mass with the children, as\nusual.\"\n\n\"But before that?\"\n\n\"Before that? No.... Let me see!... I was so upset by the theft ... but\nI remember now that, on the evening before, she asked permission to go\nout on Sunday morning ... to see a cousin who was passing through Paris,\nI think. But, surely, you don't suspect her?\"\n\n\"Of course not ... but I would like to see her.\"\n\nHe went to Wilson's room. A woman dressed in a gray cloth dress, as in\nthe hospitals, was bending over the invalid, giving him a drink. When\nshe turned her face Sholmes recognized her as the young girl who had\naccosted him at the railway station.\n\nAlice Demun smiled sweetly; her great serious, innocent eyes showed no\nsign of embarrassment. The Englishman tried to speak, muttered a few\nsyllables, and stopped. Then she resumed her work, acting quite\nnaturally under Sholmes' astonished gaze, moved the bottles, unrolled\nand rolled cotton bandages, and again regarded Sholmes with her charming\nsmile of pure innocence.\n\nHe turned on his heels, descended the stairs, noticed Mon.\nd'Imblevalle's automobile in the courtyard, jumped into it, and went to\nLevallois, to the office of the cab company whose address was printed on\nthe paper he had received from Henriette. The man who had driven\ncarriage number 8,279 on Sunday morning not being there, Sholmes\ndismissed the automobile and waited for the man's return. He told\nSholmes that he had picked up a woman in the vicinity of the Parc\nMonceau, a young woman dressed in black, wearing a heavy veil, and,\napparently, quite nervous.\n\n\"Did she have a package?\"\n\n\"Yes, quite a long package.\"\n\n\"Where did you take her?\"\n\n\"Avenue des Ternes, corner of the Place Saint-Ferdinand. She remained\nthere about ten minutes, and then returned to the Parc Monceau.\"\n\n\"Could you recognize the house in the avenue des Ternes?\"\n\n\"Parbleu! Shall I take you there?\"\n\n\"Presently. First take me to 36 quai des Orf\u00c3\u00a8vres.\"\n\nAt the police office he saw Detective Ganimard.\n\n\"Monsieur Ganimard, are you at liberty?\"\n\n\"If it has anything to do with Lupin--no!\"\n\n\"It has something to do with Lupin.\"\n\n\"Then I do not go.\"\n\n\"What! you surrender----\"\n\n\"I bow to the inevitable. I am tired of the unequal struggle, in which\nwe are sure to be defeated. Lupin is stronger than I am--stronger than\nthe two of us; therefore, we must surrender.\"\n\n\"I will not surrender.\"\n\n\"He will make you, as he has all others.\"\n\n\"And you would be pleased to see it--eh, Ganimard?\"\n\n\"At all events, it is true,\" said Ganimard, frankly. \"And since you are\ndetermined to pursue the game, I will go with you.\"\n\nTogether they entered the carriage and were driven to the avenue des\nTernes. Upon their order the carriage stopped on the other side of the\nstreet, at some distance from the house, in front of a little caf\u00c3\u00a9, on\nthe terrace of which the two men took seats amongst the shrubbery. It\nwas commencing to grow dark.\n\n\"Waiter,\" said Sholmes, \"some writing material.\"\n\nHe wrote a note, recalled the waiter and gave him the letter with\ninstructions to deliver it to the concierge of the house which he\npointed out.\n\nIn a few minutes the concierge stood before them. Sholmes asked him if,\non the Sunday morning, he had seen a young woman dressed in black.\n\n\"In black? Yes, about nine o'clock. She went to the second floor.\"\n\n\"Have you seen her often?\"\n\n\"No, but for some time--well, during the last few weeks, I have seen her\nalmost every day.\"\n\n\"And since Sunday?\"\n\n\"Only once ... until to-day.\"\n\n\"What! Did she come to-day?\"\n\n\"She is here now.\"\n\n\"Here now?\"\n\n\"Yes, she came about ten minutes ago. Her carriage is standing in the\nPlace Saint-Ferdinand, as usual. I met her at the door.\"\n\n\"Who is the occupant of the second floor?\"\n\n\"There are two: a modiste, Mademoiselle Langeais, and a gentleman who\nrented two furnished rooms a month ago under the name of Bresson.\"\n\n\"Why do you say 'under the name'?\"\n\n\"Because I have an idea that it is an assumed name. My wife takes care\nof his rooms, and ... well, there are not two shirts there with the same\ninitials.\"\n\n\"Is he there much of the time?\"\n\n\"No; he is nearly always out. He has not been here for three days.\"\n\n\"Was he here on Saturday night?\"\n\n\"Saturday night?... Let me think.... Yes, Saturday night, he came in and\nstayed all night.\"\n\n\"What sort of a man is he?\"\n\n\"Well, I can scarcely answer that. He is so changeable. He is, by turns,\nbig, little, fat, thin ... dark and light. I do not always recognize\nhim.\"\n\nGanimard and Sholmes exchanged looks.\n\n\"That is he, all right,\" said Ganimard.\n\n\"Ah!\" said the concierge, \"there is the girl now.\"\n\nMademoiselle had just emerged from the house and was walking toward her\ncarriage in the Place Saint-Ferdinand.\n\n\"And there is Monsieur Bresson.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Bresson? Which is he?\"\n\n\"The man with the parcel under his arm.\"\n\n\"But he is not looking after the girl. She is going to her carriage\nalone.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have never seen them together.\"\n\nThe two detectives had arisen. By the light of the street-lamps they\nrecognized the form of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin, who had started off in a direction\nopposite to that taken by the girl.\n\n\"Which will you follow?\" asked Ganimard.\n\n\"I will follow him, of course. He's the biggest game.\"\n\n\"Then I will follow the girl,\" proposed Ganimard.\n\n\"No, no,\" said Sholmes, quickly, who did not wish to disclose the girl's\nidentity to Ganimard, \"I know where to find her. Come with me.\"\n\nThey followed Lupin at a safe distance, taking care to conceal\nthemselves as well as possible amongst the moving throng and behind the\nnewspaper kiosks. They found the pursuit an easy one, as he walked\nsteadily forward without turning to the right or left, but with a\nslight limp in the right leg, so slight as to require the keen eye of a\nprofessional observer to detect it. Ganimard observed it, and said:\n\n\"He is pretending to be lame. Ah! if we could only collect two or three\npolicemen and pounce on our man! We run a chance to lose him.\"\n\nBut they did not meet any policemen before they reached the Porte des\nTernes, and, having passed the fortifications, there was no prospect of\nreceiving any assistance.\n\n\"We had better separate,\" said Sholmes, \"as there are so few people on\nthe street.\"\n\nThey were now on the Boulevard Victor-Hugo. They walked one on each side\nof the street, and kept well in the shadow of the trees. They continued\nthus for twenty minutes, when Lupin turned to the left and followed the\nSeine. Very soon they saw him descend to the edge of the river. He\nremained there only a few seconds, but they could not observe his\nmovements. Then Lupin retraced his steps. His pursuers concealed\nthemselves in the shadow of a gateway. Lupin passed in front of them.\nHis parcel had disappeared. And as he walked away another man emerged\nfrom the shelter of a house and glided amongst the trees.\n\n\"He seems to be following him also,\" said Sholmes, in a low voice.\n\nThe pursuit continued, but was now embarrassed by the presence of the\nthird man. Lupin returned the same way, passed through the Porte des\nTernes, and re-entered the house in the avenue des Ternes.\n\nThe concierge was closing the house for the night when Ganimard\npresented himself.\n\n\"Did you see him?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the concierge, \"I was putting out the gas on the landing\nwhen he closed and bolted his door.\"\n\n\"Is there any person with him?\"\n\n\"No; he has no servant. He never eats here.\"\n\n\"Is there a servants' stairway?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nGanimard said to Sholmes:\n\n\"I had better stand at the door of his room while you go for the\ncommissary of police in the rue Demours.\"\n\n\"And if he should escape during that time?\" said Sholmes.\n\n\"While I am here! He can't escape.\"\n\n\"One to one, with Lupin, is not an even chance for you.\"\n\n\"Well, I can't force the door. I have no right to do that, especially at\nnight.\"\n\nSholmes shrugged his shoulders and said:\n\n\"When you arrest Lupin no one will question the methods by which you\nmade the arrest. However, let us go up and ring, and see what happens\nthen.\"\n\nThey ascended to the second floor. There was a double door at the left\nof the landing. Ganimard rang the bell. No reply. He rang again. Still\nno reply.\n\n\"Let us go in,\" said Sholmes.\n\n\"All right, come on,\" replied Ganimard.\n\nYet, they stood still, irresolute. Like people who hesitate when they\nought to accomplish a decisive action they feared to move, and it seemed\nto them impossible that Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin was there, so close to them, on the\nother side of that fragile door that could be broken down by one blow of\nthe fist. But they knew Lupin too well to suppose that he would allow\nhimself to be trapped in that stupid manner. No, no--a thousand times,\nno--Lupin was no longer there. Through the adjoining houses, over the\nroofs, by some conveniently prepared exit, he must have already made\nhis escape, and, once more, it would only be Lupin's shadow that they\nwould seize.\n\nThey shuddered as a slight noise, coming from the other side of the\ndoor, reached their ears. Then they had the impression, amounting almost\nto a certainty, that he was there, separated from them by that frail\nwooden door, and that he was listening to them, that he could hear them.\n\nWhat was to be done? The situation was a serious one. In spite of their\nvast experience as detectives, they were so nervous and excited that\nthey thought they could hear the beating of their own hearts. Ganimard\nquestioned Sholmes by a look. Then he struck the door a violent blow\nwith his fist. Immediately they heard the sound of footsteps, concerning\nwhich there was no attempt at concealment.\n\nGanimard shook the door. Then he and Sholmes, uniting their efforts,\nrushed at the door, and burst it open with their shoulders. Then they\nstood still, in surprise. A shot had been fired in the adjoining room.\nAnother shot, and the sound of a falling body.\n\nWhen they entered they saw the man lying on the floor with his face\ntoward the marble mantel. His revolver had fallen from his hand.\nGanimard stooped and turned the man's head. The face was covered with\nblood, which was flowing from two wounds, one in the cheek, the other in\nthe temple.\n\n\"You can't recognize him for blood.\"\n\n\"No matter!\" said Sholmes. \"It is not Lupin.\"\n\n\"How do you know? You haven't even looked at him.\"\n\n\"Do you think that Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin is the kind of a man that would kill\nhimself?\" asked Sholmes, with a sneer.\n\n\"But we thought we recognized him outside.\"\n\n\"We thought so, because the wish was father to the thought. That man has\nus bewitched.\"\n\n\"Then it must be one of his accomplices.\"\n\n\"The accomplices of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin do not kill themselves.\"\n\n\"Well, then, who is it?\"\n\nThey searched the corpse. In one pocket Herlock Sholmes found an empty\npocketbook; in another Ganimard found several louis. There were no marks\nof identification on any part of his clothing. In a trunk and two\nvalises they found nothing but wearing apparel. On the mantel there was\na pile of newspapers. Ganimard opened them. All of them contained\narticles referring to the theft of the Jewish lamp.\n\nAn hour later, when Ganimard and Sholmes left the house, they had\nacquired no further knowledge of the strange individual who had been\ndriven to suicide by their untimely visit.\n\nWho was he? Why had he killed himself? What was his connection with the\naffair of the Jewish lamp? Who had followed him on his return from the\nriver? The situation involved many complex questions--many mysteries----\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHerlock Sholmes went to bed in a very bad humor. Early next morning he\nreceived the following telephonic message:\n\n\"Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin has the honor to inform you of his tragic death in the\nperson of Monsieur Bresson, and requests the honor of your presence at\nthe funeral service and burial, which will be held at the public expense\non Thursday, 25 June.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nTHE SHIPWRECK.\n\n\n\"That's what I don't like, Wilson,\" said Herlock Sholmes, after he had\nread Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin's message; \"that is what exasperates me in this\naffair--to feel that the cunning, mocking eye of that fellow follows me\neverywhere. He sees everything; he knows everything; he reads my inmost\nthoughts; he even foresees my slightest movement. Ah! he is possessed of\na marvellous intuition, far surpassing that of the most instinctive\nwoman, yes, surpassing even that of Herlock Sholmes himself. Nothing\nescapes him. I resemble an actor whose every step and movement are\ndirected by a stage-manager; who says this and does that in obedience to\na superior will. That is my position. Do you understand, Wilson?\"\n\nCertainly Wilson would have understood if his faculties had not been\ndeadened by the profound slumber of a man whose temperature varies\nbetween one hundred and one hundred and three degrees. But whether he\nheard or not was a matter of no consequence to Herlock Sholmes, who\ncontinued:\n\n\"I have to concentrate all my energy and bring all my resources into\naction in order to make the slightest progress. And, fortunately for me,\nthose petty annoyances are like so many pricks from a needle and serve\nonly to stimulate me. As soon as the heat of the wound is appeased and\nthe shock to my vanity has subsided I say to myself: 'Amuse yourself, my\ndear fellow, but remember that he who laughs last laughs best. Sooner or\nlater you will betray yourself.' For you know, Wilson, it was Lupin\nhimself, who, by his first dispatch and the observation that it\nsuggested to little Henriette, disclosed to me the secret of his\ncorrespondence with Alice Hemun. Have you forgotten that circumstance,\ndear boy?\"\n\nBut Wilson was asleep; and Sholmes, pacing to and fro, resumed his\nspeech:\n\n\"And, now, things are not in a bad shape; a little obscure, perhaps, but\nthe light is creeping in. In the first place, I must learn all about\nMonsieur Bresson. Ganimard and I will visit the bank of the river, at\nthe spot where Bresson threw away the package, and the particular r\u00c3\u00b4le\nof that gentleman will be known to me. After that the game will be\nplayed between me and Alice Demun. Rather a light-weight opponent, hein,\nWilson? And do you not think that I will soon know the phrase\nrepresented by the letters clipped from the alphabet-book, and what the\nisolated letters--the 'C' and the 'H'--mean? That is all I want to know,\nWilson.\"\n\nMademoiselle entered at that moment, and, observing Sholmes\ngesticulating, she said, in her sweetest manner:\n\n\"Monsieur Sholmes, I must scold you if you waken my patient. It isn't\nnice of you to disturb him. The doctor has ordered absolute rest.\"\n\nHe looked at her in silence, astonished, as on their first meeting, at\nher wonderful self-possession.\n\n\"Why do you look at me so, Monsieur Sholmes?... You seem to be trying to\nread my thoughts.... No?... Then what is it?\"\n\nShe questioned him with the most innocent expression on her pretty face\nand in her frank blue eyes. A smile played upon her lips; and she\ndisplayed so much unaffected candor that the Englishman almost lost his\ntemper. He approached her and said, in a low voice:\n\n\"Bresson killed himself last night.\"\n\nShe affected not to understand him; so he repeated:\n\n\"Bresson killed himself yesterday....\"\n\nShe did not show the slightest emotion; she acted as if the matter did\nnot concern or interest her in any way.\n\n\"You have been informed,\" said Sholmes, displaying his annoyance.\n\"Otherwise, the news would have caused you to start, at least. Ah! you\nare stronger than I expected. But what's the use of your trying to\nconceal anything from me?\"\n\nHe picked up the alphabet-book, which he had placed on a convenient\ntable, and, opening it at the mutilated page, said:\n\n\"Will you tell me the order in which the missing letters should be\narranged in order to express the exact wording of the message you sent\nto Bresson four days before the theft of the Jewish lamp?\"\n\n\"The order?... Bresson?... the theft of the Jewish lamp?\"\n\nShe repeated the words slowly, as if trying to grasp their meaning. He\ncontinued:\n\n\"Yes. Here are the letters employed ... on this bit of paper.... What\ndid you say to Bresson?\"\n\n\"The letters employed ... what did I say....\"\n\nSuddenly she burst into laughter:\n\n\"Ah! that is it! I understand! I am an accomplice in the crime! There is\na Monsieur Bresson who stole the Jewish lamp and who has now committed\nsuicide. And I am the friend of that gentleman. Oh! how absurd you are!\"\n\n\"Whom did you go to see last night on the second floor of a house in the\navenue des Ternes?\"\n\n\"Who? My modiste, Mademoiselle Langeais. Do you suppose that my modiste\nand my friend Monsieur Bresson are the same person?\"\n\nDespite all he knew, Sholmes was now in doubt. A person can feign\nterror, joy, anxiety, in fact all emotions; but a person cannot feign\nabsolute indifference or light, careless laughter. Yet he continued to\nquestion her:\n\n\"Why did you accost me the other evening at the Northern Railway\nstation? And why did you entreat me to leave Paris immediately without\ninvestigating this theft?\"\n\n\"Ah! you are too inquisitive, Monsieur Sholmes,\" she replied, still\nlaughing in the most natural manner. \"To punish you I will tell you\nnothing, and, besides, you must watch the patient while I go to the\npharmacy on an urgent message. Au revoir.\"\n\nShe left the room.\n\n\"I am beaten ... by a girl,\" muttered Sholmes. \"Not only did I get\nnothing out of her but I exposed my hand and put her on her guard.\"\n\nAnd he recalled the affair of the blue diamond and his first interview\nwith Clotilde Destange. Had not the blonde Lady met his question with\nthe same unruffled serenity, and was he not once more face to face with\none of those creatures who, under the protection and influence of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne\nLupin, maintain the utmost coolness in the face of a terrible danger?\n\n\"Sholmes ... Sholmes....\"\n\nIt was Wilson who called him. Sholmes approached the bed, and, leaning\nover, said:\n\n\"What's the matter, Wilson? Does your wound pain you?\"\n\nWilson's lips moved, but he could not speak. At last, with a great\neffort, he stammered:\n\n\"No ... Sholmes ... it is not she ... that is impossible----\"\n\n\"Come, Wilson, what do you know about it? I tell you that it is she! It\nis only when I meet one of Lupin's creatures, prepared and instructed by\nhim, that I lose my head and make a fool of myself.... I bet you that\nwithin an hour Lupin will know all about our interview. Within an hour?\nWhat am I saying?... Why, he may know already. The visit to the pharmacy\n... urgent message. All nonsense!... She has gone to telephone to\nLupin.\"\n\nSholmes left the house hurriedly, went down the avenue de Messine, and\nwas just in time to see Mademoiselle enter a pharmacy. Ten minutes later\nshe emerged from the shop carrying some small packages and a bottle\nwrapped in white paper. But she had not proceeded far, when she was\naccosted by a man who, with hat in hand and an obsequious air, appeared\nto be asking for charity. She stopped, gave him something, and proceeded\non her way.\n\n\"She spoke to him,\" said the Englishman to himself.\n\nIf not a certainty, it was at least an intuition, and quite sufficient\nto cause him to change his tactics. Leaving the girl to pursue her own\ncourse, he followed the suspected mendicant, who walked slowly to the\navenue des Ternes and lingered for a long time around the house in\nwhich Bresson had lived, sometimes raising his eyes to the windows of\nthe second floor and watching the people who entered the house.\n\nAt the end of an hour he climbed to the top of a tramcar going in the\ndirection of Neuilly. Sholmes followed and took a seat behind the man,\nand beside a gentleman who was concealed behind the pages of a\nnewspaper. At the fortifications the gentleman lowered the paper, and\nSholmes recognized Ganimard, who thereupon whispered, as he pointed to\nthe man in front:\n\n\"It is the man who followed Bresson last night. He has been watching the\nhouse for an hour.\"\n\n\"Anything new in regard to Bresson?\" asked Sholmes.\n\n\"Yes, a letter came to his address this morning.\"\n\n\"This morning? Then it was posted yesterday before the sender could know\nof Bresson's death.\"\n\n\"Exactly. It is now in the possession of the examining magistrate. But I\nread it. It says: _He will not accept any compromise. He wants\neverything--the first thing as well as those of the second affair.\nOtherwise he will proceed._\"\n\n\"There is no signature,\" added Ganimard. \"It seems to me those few lines\nwon't help us much.\"\n\n\"I don't agree with you, Monsieur Ganimard. To me those few lines are\nvery interesting.\"\n\n\"Why so? I can't see it.\"\n\n\"For reasons that are personal to me,\" replied Sholmes, with the\nindifference that he frequently displayed toward his colleague.\n\nThe tramcar stopped at the rue de Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau, which was the terminus. The\nman descended and walked away quietly. Sholmes followed at so short a\ndistance that Ganimard protested, saying:\n\n\"If he should turn around he will suspect us.\"\n\n\"He will not turn around.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"He is an accomplice of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin, and the fact that he walks in that\nmanner, with his hands in his pockets, proves, in the first place, that\nhe knows he is being followed and, in the second place, that he is not\nafraid.\"\n\n\"But I think we are keeping too close to him.\"\n\n\"Not too close to prevent his slipping through our fingers. He is too\nsure of himself.\"\n\n\"Ah! Look there! In front of that caf\u00c3\u00a9 there are two of the bicycle\npolice. If I summon them to our assistance, how can the man slip through\nour fingers?\"\n\n\"Well, our friend doesn't seem to be worried about it. In fact, he is\nasking for their assistance himself.\"\n\n\"Mon Dieu!\" exclaimed Ganimard, \"he has a nerve.\"\n\nThe man approached the two policemen just as they were mounting their\nbicycles. After a few words with them he leaped on a third bicycle,\nwhich was leaning against the wall of the caf\u00c3\u00a9, and rode away at a fast\npace, accompanied by the two policemen.\n\n\"Hein! one, two, three and away!\" growled Sholmes. \"And through, whose\nagency, Monsieur Ganimard? Two of your colleagues.... Ah! but Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne\nLupin has a wonderful organization! Bicycle policemen in his service!...\nI told you our man was too calm, too sure of himself.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Ganimard, quite vexed, \"what are we to do now? It is\neasy enough to laugh! Anyone can do that.\"\n\n\"Come, come, don't lose your temper! We will get our revenge. But, in\nthe meantime, we need reinforcements.\"\n\n\"Folenfant is waiting for me at the end of the avenue de Neuilly.\"\n\n\"Well, go and get him and join me later. I will follow our fugitive.\"\n\nSholmes followed the bicycle tracks, which were plainly visible in the\ndust of the road as two of the machines were furnished with striated\ntires. Very soon he ascertained that the tracks were leading him to the\nedge of the Seine, and that the three men had turned in the direction\ntaken by Bresson on the preceding evening. Thus he arrived at the\ngateway where he and Ganimard had concealed themselves, and, a little\nfarther on, he discovered a mingling of the bicycle tracks which showed\nthat the men had halted at that spot. Directly opposite there was a\nlittle point of land which projected into the river and, at the\nextremity thereof, an old boat was moored.\n\nIt was there that Bresson had thrown away the package, or, rather, had\ndropped it. Sholmes descended the bank and saw that the declivity was\nnot steep and the water quite shallow, so it would be quite easy to\nrecover the package, provided the three men had not forestalled him.\n\n\"No, that can't be,\" he thought, \"they have not had time. A quarter of\nan hour at the most. And yet, why did they come this way?\"\n\nA fisherman was seated on the old boat. Sholmes asked him:\n\n\"Did you see three men on bicycles a few minutes ago?\"\n\nThe fisherman made a negative gesture. But Sholmes insisted:\n\n\"Three men who stopped on the road just on top of the bank?\"\n\nThe fisherman rested his pole under his arm, took a memorandum book from\nhis pocket, wrote on one of the pages, tore it out, and handed it to\nSholmes. The Englishman gave a start of surprise. In the middle of the\npaper which he held in his hand he saw the series of letters cut from\nthe alphabet-book:\n\nCDEHNOPRZEO--237.\n\nThe man resumed his fishing, sheltered from the sun by a large straw\nhat, with his coat and vest lying beside him. He was intently watching\nthe cork attached to his line as it floated on the surface of the water.\n\nThere was a moment of silence--solemn and terrible.\n\n\"Is it he?\" conjectured Sholmes, with an anxiety that was almost\npitiful. Then the truth burst upon him:\n\n\"It is he! It is he! No one else could remain there so calmly, without\nthe slightest display of anxiety, without the least fear of what might\nhappen. And who else would know the story of those mysterious letters?\nAlice had warned him by means of her messenger.\"\n\nSuddenly the Englishman felt that his hand--that his own hand had\ninvoluntarily seized the handle of his revolver, and that his eyes were\nfixed on the man's back, a little below the neck. One movement, and the\ndrama would be finished; the life of the strange adventurer would come\nto a miserable end.\n\nThe fisherman did not stir.\n\nSholmes nervously toyed with his revolver, and experienced a wild desire\nto fire it and end everything; but the horror of such an act was\nrepugnant to his nature. Death would be certain and would end all.\n\n\"Ah!\" he thought, \"let him get up and defend himself. If he doesn't, so\nmuch the worse for him. One second more ... and I fire....\"\n\nBut a sound of footsteps behind him caused him to turn his head. It was\nGanimard coming with some assistants.\n\nThen, quickly changing his plans, Sholmes leaped into the boat, which\nwas broken from its moorings by his sudden action; he pounced upon the\nman and seized him around the body. They rolled to the bottom of the\nboat together.\n\n\"Well, now!\" exclaimed Lupin, struggling to free himself, \"what does\nthis mean? When one of us has conquered the other, what good will it do?\nYou will not know what to do with me, nor I with you. We will remain\nhere like two idiots.\"\n\nThe two oars slipped into the water. The boat drifted into the stream.\n\n\"Good Lord, what a fuss you make! A man of your age ought to know\nbetter! You act like a child.\"\n\nLupin succeeded in freeing himself from the grasp of the detective, who,\nthoroughly exasperated and ready to kill, put his hand in his pocket. He\nuttered an oath: Lupin had taken his revolver. Then he knelt down and\ntried to capture one of the lost oars in order to regain the shore,\nwhile Lupin was trying to capture the other oar in order to drive the\nboat down the river.\n\n\"It's gone! I can't reach it,\" said Lupin. \"But it's of no consequence.\nIf you get your oar I can prevent your using it. And you could do the\nsame to me. But, you see, that is the way in this world, we act without\nany purpose or reason, as our efforts are in vain since Fate decides\neverything. Now, don't you see, Fate is on the side of his friend Lupin.\nThe game is mine! The current favors me!\"\n\nThe boat was slowly drifting down the river.\n\n\"Look out!\" cried Lupin, quickly.\n\nSomeone on the bank was pointing a revolver. Lupin stooped, a shot was\nfired; it struck the water beyond the boat. Lupin burst into laughter.\n\n\"God bless me! It's my friend Ganimard! But it was very wrong of you to\ndo that, Ganimard. You have no right to shoot except in self-defense.\nDoes poor Lupin worry you so much that you forget yourself?... Now, be\ngood, and don't shoot again!... If you do you will hit our English\nfriend.\"\n\nHe stood behind Sholmes, facing Ganimard, and said:\n\n\"Now, Ganimard, I am ready! Aim for his heart!... Higher!... A little to\nthe left.... Ah! you missed that time ... deuced bad shot.... Try\nagain.... Your hand shakes, Ganimard.... Now, once more ... one, two,\nthree, fire!... Missed!... Parbleu! the authorities furnish you with\ntoy-pistols.\"\n\nLupin drew a long revolver and fired without taking aim. Ganimard put\nhis hand to his hat: the bullet had passed through it.\n\n\"What do you think of that, Ganimard! Ah! that's a real revolver! A\ngenuine English bulldog. It belongs to my friend, Herlock Sholmes.\"\n\nAnd, with a laugh, he threw the revolver to the shore, where it landed\nat Ganimard's feet.\n\nSholmes could not withhold a smile of admiration. What a torrent of\nyouthful spirits! And how he seemed to enjoy himself! It appeared as if\nthe sensation of peril caused him a physical pleasure; and this\nextraordinary man had no other purpose in life than to seek for dangers\nsimply for the amusement it afforded him in avoiding them.\n\nMany people had now gathered on the banks of the river, and Ganimard\nand his men followed the boat as it slowly floated down the stream.\nLupin's capture was a mathematical certainty.\n\n\"Confess, old fellow,\" said Lupin, turning to the Englishman, \"that you\nwould not exchange your present position for all the gold in the\nTransvaal! You are now in the first row of the orchestra chairs! But, in\nthe first place, we must have the prologue ... after which we can leap,\nat one bound, to the fifth act of the drama, which will represent the\ncapture or escape of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin. Therefore, I am going to ask you a\nplain question, to which I request a plain answer--a simple yes or no.\nWill you renounce this affair? At present I can repair the damage you\nhave done; later it will be beyond my power. Is it a bargain?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nLupin's face showed his disappointment and annoyance. He continued:\n\n\"I insist. More for your sake than my own, I insist, because I am\ncertain you will be the first to regret your intervention. For the last\ntime, yes or no?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nLupin stooped down, removed one of the boards in the bottom of the\nboat, and, for some minutes, was engaged in a work the nature of which\nSholmes could not discern. Then he arose, seated himself beside the\nEnglishman, and said:\n\n\"I believe, monsieur, that we came to the river to-day for the same\npurpose: to recover the object which Bresson threw away. For my part I\nhad invited a few friends to join me here, and I was on the point of\nmaking an examination of the bed of the river when my friends announced\nyour approach. I confess that the news did not surprise me, as I have\nbeen notified every hour concerning the progress of your investigation.\nThat was an easy matter. Whenever anything occurred in the rue Murillo\nthat might interest me, simply a ring on the telephone and I was\ninformed.\"\n\nHe stopped. The board that he had displaced in the bottom of the boat\nwas rising and water was working into the boat all around it.\n\n\"The deuce! I didn't know how to fix it. I was afraid this old boat\nwould leak. You are not afraid, monsieur?\"\n\nSholmes shrugged his shoulders. Lupin continued:\n\n\"You will understand then, in those circumstances, and knowing in\nadvance that you would be more eager to seek a battle than I would be to\navoid it, I assure you I was not entirely displeased to enter into a\ncontest of which the issue is quite certain, since I hold all the trump\ncards in my hand. And I desired that our meeting should be given the\nwidest publicity in order that your defeat may be universally known, so\nthat another Countess de Crozon or another Baron d'Imblevalle may not be\ntempted to solicit your aid against me. Besides, my dear monsieur--\"\n\nHe stopped again and, using his half-closed hands as a lorgnette, he\nscanned the banks of the river.\n\n\"Mon Dieu! they have chartered a superb boat, a real war-vessel, and see\nhow they are rowing. In five minutes they will be along-side, and I am\nlost. Monsieur Sholmes, a word of advice; you seize me, bind me and\ndeliver me to the officers of the law. Does that programme please\nyou?... Unless, in the meantime, we are shipwrecked, in which event we\ncan do nothing but prepare our wills. What do you think?\"\n\nThey exchanged looks. Sholmes now understood Lupin's scheme: he had\nscuttled the boat. And the water was rising. It had reached the soles\nof their boots. Then it covered their feet; but they did not move. It\nwas half-way to their knees. The Englishman took out his tobacco, rolled\na cigarette, and lighted it. Lupin continued to talk:\n\n\"But do not regard that offer as a confession of my weakness. I\nsurrender to you in a battle in which I can achieve a victory in order\nto avoid a struggle upon a field not of my own choosing. In so doing I\nrecognize the fact that Sholmes is the only enemy I fear, and announce\nmy anxiety that Sholmes will not be diverted from my track. I take this\nopportunity to tell you these things since fate has accorded me the\nhonor of a conversation with you. I have only one regret; it is that our\nconversation should have occurred while we are taking a foot-bath ... a\nsituation that is lacking in dignity, I must confess.... What did I say?\nA foot-bath? It is worse than that.\"\n\nThe water had reached the board on which they were sitting, and the boat\nwas gradually sinking.\n\nSholmes, smoking his cigarette, appeared to be calmly admiring the\nscenery. For nothing in the world, while face to face with that man\nwho, while threatened by dangers, surrounded by a crowd, followed by a\nposse of police, maintained his equanimity and good humor, for nothing\nin the world would he, Sholmes, display the slightest sign of\nnervousness.\n\nEach of them looked as if he might say: Should a person be disturbed by\nsuch trifles? Are not people drowned in a river every day? Is it such an\nunusual event as to deserve special attention? One chatted, whilst the\nother dreamed; both concealing their wounded pride beneath a mask of\nindifference.\n\nOne minute more and the boat will sink. Lupin continued his chatter:\n\n\"The important thing to know is whether we will sink before or after the\narrival of the champions of the law. That is the main question. As to\nour shipwreck, that is a fore-gone conclusion. Now, monsieur, the hour\nhas come in which we must make our wills. I give, devise and bequeath\nall my property to Herlock Sholmes, a citizen of England, for his own\nuse and benefit. But, mon Dieu, how quickly the champions of the law are\napproaching! Ah! the brave fellows! It is a pleasure to watch them.\nObserve the precision of the oars! Ah! is it you, Brigadier Folenfant?\nBravo! The idea of a war-vessel is an excellent one. I commend you to\nyour superiors, Brigadier Folenfant.... Do you wish a medal? You shall\nhave it. And your comrade Dieuzy, where is he?... Ah! yes, I think I see\nhim on the left bank of the river at the head of a hundred natives. So\nthat, if I escape shipwreck, I shall be captured on the left by Dieuzy\nand his natives, or, on the right, by Ganimard and the populace of\nNeuilly. An embarrassing dilemma!\"\n\nThe boat entered an eddy; it swung around and Sholmes caught hold of the\noarlocks. Lupin said to him:\n\n\"Monsieur, you should remove your coat. You will find it easier to swim\nwithout a coat. No? You refuse? Then I shall put on my own.\"\n\nHe donned his coat, buttoned it closely, the same as Sholmes, and said:\n\n\"What a discourteous man you are! And what a pity that you should be so\nstubborn in this affair, in which, of course, you display your strength,\nbut, oh! so vainly! really, you mar your genius----\"\n\n\"Monsieur Lupin,\" interrupted Sholmes, emerging from his silence, \"you\ntalk too much, and you frequently err through excess of confidence and\nthrough your frivolity.\"\n\n\"That is a severe reproach.\"\n\n\"Thus, without knowing it, you furnished me, only a moment ago, with the\ninformation I required.\"\n\n\"What! you required some information and you didn't tell me?\"\n\n\"I had no occasion to ask you for it--you volunteered it. Within three\nhours I can deliver the key of the mystery to Monsieur d'Imblevalle.\nThat is the only reply----\"\n\nHe did not finish the sentence. The boat suddenly sank, taking both of\nthe men down with it. It emerged immediately, with its keel in the air.\nShouts were heard on either bank, succeeded by an anxious moment of\nsilence. Then the shouts were renewed: one of the shipwrecked party had\ncome to the surface.\n\nIt was Herlock Sholmes. He was an excellent swimmer, and struck out,\nwith powerful strokes, for Folenfant's boat.\n\n\"Courage, Monsieur Sholmes,\" shouted Folenfant; \"we are here. Keep it up\n... we will get you ... a little more, Monsieur Sholmes ... catch the\nrope.\"\n\nThe Englishman seized the rope they had thrown to him. But, while they\nwere hauling him into the boat, he heard a voice behind him, saying:\n\n\"The key of the mystery, monsieur, yes, you shall have it. I am\nastonished that you haven't got it already. What then? What good will it\ndo you? By that time you will have lost the battle....\"\n\nNow comfortably installed astride the keel of the boat, Lupin continued\nhis speech with solemn gestures, as if he hoped to convince his\nadversary.\n\n\"You must understand, my dear Sholmes, there is nothing to be done,\nabsolutely nothing. You find yourself in the deplorable position of a\ngentleman----\"\n\n\"Surrender, Lupin!\" shouted Folenfant.\n\n\"You are an ill-bred fellow, Folenfant, to interrupt me in the middle of\na sentence. I was saying----\"\n\n\"Surrender, Lupin!\"\n\n\"Oh! parbleu! Brigadier Folenfant, a man surrenders only when he is in\ndanger. Surely, you do not pretend to say that I am in any danger.\"\n\n\"For the last time, Lupin, I call on you to surrender.\"\n\n\"Brigadier Folenfant, you have no intention of killing me; you may wish\nto wound me since you are afraid I may escape. But if by chance the\nwound prove mortal! Just think of your remorse! It would embitter your\nold age.\"\n\nThe shot was fired.\n\nLupin staggered, clutched at the keel of the boat for a moment, then let\ngo and disappeared.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was exactly three o'clock when the foregoing events transpired.\nPrecisely at six o'clock, as he had foretold, Herlock Sholmes, dressed\nin trousers that were too short and a coat that was too small, which he\nhad borrowed from an innkeeper at Neuilly, wearing a cap and a flannel\nshirt, entered the boudoir in the Rue Murillo, after having sent word to\nMonsieur and Madame d'Imblevalle that he desired an interview.\n\nThey found him walking up and down the room. And he looked so ludicrous\nin his strange costume that they could scarcely suppress their mirth.\nWith pensive air and stooped shoulders, he walked like an automaton from\nthe window to the door and from the door to the window, taking each time\nthe same number of steps, and turning each time in the same manner.\n\nHe stopped, picked up a small ornament, examined it mechanically, and\nresumed his walk. At last, planting himself before them, he asked:\n\n\"Is Mademoiselle here?\"\n\n\"Yes, she is in the garden with the children.\"'\n\n\"I wish Mademoiselle to be present at this interview.\"\n\n\"Is it necessary----\"\n\n\"Have a little patience, monsieur. From the facts I am going to present\nto you, you will see the necessity for her presence here.\"\n\n\"Very well. Suzanne, will you call her?\"\n\nMadame d'Imblevalle arose, went out, and returned almost immediately,\naccompanied by Alice Demun. Mademoiselle, who was a trifle paler than\nusual, remained standing, leaning against a table, and without even\nasking why she had been called. Sholmes did not look at her, but,\nsuddenly turning toward Monsieur d'Imblevalle, he said, in a tone which\ndid not admit of a reply:\n\n\"After several days' investigation, monsieur, I must repeat what I told\nyou when I first came here: the Jewish lamp was stolen by some one\nliving in the house.\"\n\n\"The name of the guilty party?\"\n\n\"I know it.\"\n\n\"Your proof?\"\n\n\"I have sufficient to establish that fact.\"\n\n\"But we require more than that. We desire the restoration of the stolen\ngoods.\"\n\n\"The Jewish lamp? It is in my possession.\"\n\n\"The opal necklace? The snuff-box?\"\n\n\"The opal necklace, the snuff-box, and all the goods stolen on the\nsecond occasion are in my possession.\"\n\nSholmes delighted in these dramatic dialogues, and it pleased him to\nannounce his victories in that curt manner. The baron and his wife were\namazed, and looked at Sholmes with a silent curiosity, which was the\nhighest praise.\n\nHe related to them, very minutely, what he had done during those three\ndays. He told of his discovery of the alphabet book, wrote upon a sheet\nof paper the sentence formed by the missing letters, then related the\njourney of Bresson to the bank of the river and the suicide of the\nadventurer, and, finally, his struggle with Lupin, the shipwreck, and\nthe disappearance of Lupin. When he had finished, the baron said, in a\nlow voice:\n\n\"Now, you have told us everything except the name of the guilty party.\nWhom do you accuse?\"\n\n\"I accuse the person who cut the letters from the alphabet book, and\ncommunicated with Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin by means of those letters.\"\n\n\"How do you know that such correspondence was carried on with Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne\nLupin?\"\n\n\"My information comes from Lupin himself.\"\n\nHe produced a piece of paper that was wet and crumpled. It was the page\nwhich Lupin had torn from his memorandum-book, and upon which he had\nwritten the phrase.\n\n\"And you will notice,\" said Sholmes, with satisfaction, \"that he was not\nobliged to give me that sheet of paper, and, in that way, disclose his\nidentity. Simple childishness on his part, and yet it gave me exactly\nthe information I desired.\"\n\n\"What was it?\" asked the baron. \"I don't understand.\"\n\nSholmes took a pencil and made a fresh copy of the letters and figures.\n\n\"CDEHNOPRZEO--237.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said the baron; \"it is the formula you showed me yourself.\"\n\n\"No. If you had turned and returned that formula in every way, as I have\ndone, you would have seen at first glance that this formula is not like\nthe first one.\"\n\n\"In what respect do they differ?\"\n\n\"This one has two more letters--an E and an O.\"\n\n\"Really; I hadn't noticed that.\"\n\n\"Join those two letters to the C and the H which remained after forming\nthe word 'respondez,' and you will agree with me that the only possible\nword is ECHO.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"It refers to the _Echo de France_, Lupin's newspaper, his official\norgan, the one in which he publishes his communications. Reply in the\n_Echo de France_, in the personal advertisements, under number 237. That\nis the key to the mystery, and Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin was kind enough to furnish\nit to me. I went to the newspaper office.\"\n\n\"What did you find there?\"\n\n\"I found the entire story of the relations between Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin and his\naccomplice.\"\n\nSholmes produced seven newspapers which he opened at the fourth page\nand pointed to the following lines:\n\n1. Ars. Lup. Lady implores protection. 540.\n\n2. 540. Awaiting particulars. A.L.\n\n3. A.L. Under domin. enemy. Lost.\n\n4. 540. Write address. Will make investigation.\n\n5. A.L. Murillo.\n\n6. 540. Park three o'clock. Violets.\n\n7. 237. Understand. Sat. Will be Sun. morn. park.\n\n\"And you call that the whole story!\" exclaimed the baron.\n\n\"Yes, and if you will listen to me for a few minutes, I think I can\nconvince you. In the first place, a lady who signs herself 540 implores\nthe protection of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin, who replies by asking for particulars.\nThe lady replies that she is under the domination of an enemy--who is\nBresson, no doubt--and that she is lost if some one does not come to her\nassistance. Lupin is suspicious and does not yet venture to appoint an\ninterview with the unknown woman, demands the address and proposes to\nmake an investigation. The lady hesitates for four days--look at the\ndates--finally, under stress of circumstances and influenced by\nBresson's threats, she gives the name of the street--Murillo. Next day,\nArs\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin announces that he will be in the Park Monceau at three\no'clock, and asks his unknown correspondent to wear a bouquet of violets\nas a means of identification. Then there is a lapse of eight days in the\ncorrespondence. Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin and the lady do not require to correspond\nthrough the newspaper now, as they see each other or write directly. The\nscheme is arranged in this way: in order to satisfy Bresson's demands,\nthe lady is to carry off the Jewish lamp. The date is not yet fixed. The\nlady who, as a matter of prudence, corresponds by means of letters cut\nout of a book, decides on Saturday and adds: _Reply Echo 237_. Lupin\nreplies that it is understood and that he will be in the park on Sunday\nmorning. Sunday morning, the theft takes place.\"\n\n\"Really, that is an excellent chain of circumstantial evidence and every\nlink is complete,\" said the baron.\n\n\"The theft has taken place,\" continued Sholmes. \"The lady goes out on\nSunday morning, tells Lupin what she has done, and carries the Jewish\nlamp to Bresson. Everything occurs then exactly as Lupin had foreseen.\nThe officers of the law, deceived by an open window, four holes in the\nground and two scratches on the balcony railing, immediately advance the\ntheory that the theft was committed by a burglar. The lady is safe.\"\n\n\"Yes, I confess the theory was a logical one,\" said the baron. \"But the\nsecond theft--\"\n\n\"The second theft was provoked by the first. The newspapers having\nrelated how the Jewish lamp had disappeared, some one conceived the idea\nof repeating the crime and carrying away what had been left. This time,\nit was not a simulated theft, but a real one, a genuine burglary, with\nladders and other paraphernalia--\"\n\n\"Lupin, of course--\"\n\n\"No. Lupin does not act so stupidly. He doesn't fire at people for\ntrifling reasons.\"\n\n\"Then, who was it?\"\n\n\"Bresson, no doubt, and unknown to the lady whom he had menaced. It was\nBresson who entered here; it was Bresson that I pursued; it was Bresson\nwho wounded poor Wilson.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of it?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. One of Bresson's accomplices wrote to him yesterday, before\nhis suicide, a letter which proves that negotiations were pending\nbetween this accomplice and Lupin for the restitution of all the\narticles stolen from your house. Lupin demanded everything, '_the first\nthing_ (that is, the Jewish lamp) _as well as those of the second\naffair_.' Moreover, he was watching Bresson. When the latter returned\nfrom the river last night, one of Lupin's men followed him as well as\nwe.\"\n\n\"What was Bresson doing at the river?\"\n\n\"Having been warned of the progress of my investigations----\"\n\n\"Warned! by whom?\"\n\n\"By the same lady, who justly feared that the discovery of the Jewish\nlamp would lead to the discovery of her own adventure. Thereupon,\nBresson, having been warned, made into a package all the things that\ncould compromise him and threw them into a place where he thought he\ncould get them again when the danger was past. It was after his return,\ntracked by Ganimard and myself, having, no doubt, other sins on his\nconscience, that he lost his head and killed himself.\"\n\n\"But what did the package contain?\"\n\n\"The Jewish lamp and your other ornaments.\"\n\n\"Then, they are not in your possession?\"\n\n\"Immediately after Lupin's disappearance, I profited by the bath he had\nforced upon me, went to the spot selected by Bresson, where I found the\nstolen articles wrapped in some soiled linen. They are there, on the\ntable.\"\n\nWithout a word, the baron cut the cord, tore open the wet linen, picked\nout the lamp, turned a screw in the foot, then divided the bowl of the\nlamp which opened in two equal parts and there he found the golden\nchimera, set with rubies and emeralds.\n\nIt was intact.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was in that scene, so natural in appearance and which consisted of\na simple exposition of facts, something which rendered it frightfully\ntragic--it was the formal, direct, irrefutable accusation that Sholmes\nlaunched in each of his words against Mademoiselle. And it was also the\nimpressive silence of Alice Demun.\n\nDuring that long, cruel accumulation of accusing circumstances heaped\none upon another, not a muscle of her face had moved, not a trace of\nrevolt or fear had marred the serenity of her limpid eyes. What were\nher thoughts. And, especially, what was she going to say at the solemn\nmoment when it would become necessary for her to speak and defend\nherself in order to break the chain of evidence that Herlock Sholmes had\nso cleverly woven around her?\n\nThat moment had come, but the girl was silent.\n\n\"Speak! Speak!\" cried Mon. d'Imblevalle.\n\nShe did not speak. So he insisted:\n\n\"One word will clear you. One word of denial, and I will believe you.\"\n\nThat word, she would not utter.\n\nThe baron paced to and fro in his excitement; then, addressing Sholmes,\nhe said:\n\n\"No, monsieur, I cannot believe it, I do not believe it. There are\nimpossible crimes! and this is opposed to all I know and to all that I\nhave seen during the past year. No, I cannot believe it.\"\n\nHe placed his hand on the Englishman's shoulder, and said:\n\n\"But you yourself, monsieur, are you absolutely certain that you are\nright?\"\n\nSholmes hesitated, like a man on whom a sudden demand is made and cannot\nframe an immediate reply. Then he smiled, and said:\n\n\"Only the person whom I accuse, by reason of her situation in your\nhouse, could know that the Jewish lamp contained that magnificent\njewel.\"\n\n\"I cannot believe it,\" repeated the baron.\n\n\"Ask her.\"\n\nIt was, really, the very thing he would not have done, blinded by the\nconfidence the girl had inspired in him. But he could no longer refrain\nfrom doing it. He approached her and, looking into her eyes, said:\n\n\"Was it you, mademoiselle? Was it you who took the jewel? Was it you who\ncorresponded with Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin and committed the theft?\"\n\n\"It was I, monsieur,\" she replied.\n\nShe did not drop her head. Her face displayed no sign of shame or fear.\n\n\"Is it possible?\" murmured Mon. d'Imblevalle. \"I would never have\nbelieved it.... You are the last person in the world that I would have\nsuspected. How did you do it?\"\n\n\"I did it exactly as Monsieur Sholmes has told it. On Saturday night I\ncame to the boudoir, took the lamp, and, in the morning I carried it ...\nto that man.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the baron; \"what you pretend to have done is impossible.\"\n\n\"Impossible--why?\"\n\n\"Because, in the morning I found the door of the boudoir bolted.\"\n\nShe blushed, and looked at Sholmes as if seeking his counsel. Sholmes\nwas astonished at her embarrassment. Had she nothing to say? Did the\nconfessions, which had corroborated the report that he, Sholmes, had\nmade concerning the theft of the Jewish lamp, merely serve to mask a\nlie? Was she misleading them by a false confession?\n\nThe baron continued:\n\n\"That door was locked. I found the door exactly as I had left it the\nnight before. If you entered by that door, as you pretend, some one must\nhave opened it from the interior--that is to say, from the boudoir or\nfrom our chamber. Now, there was no one inside these two rooms ... there\nwas no one except my wife and myself.\"\n\nSholmes bowed his head and covered his face with his hands in order to\nconceal his emotion. A sudden light had entered his mind, that startled\nhim and made him exceedingly uncomfortable. Everything was revealed to\nhim, like the sudden lifting of a fog from the morning landscape. He was\nannoyed as well as ashamed, because his deductions were fallacious and\nhis entire theory was wrong.\n\nAlice Demun was innocent!\n\nAlice Demun was innocent. That proposition explained the embarrassment\nhe had experienced from the beginning in directing the terrible\naccusation against that young girl. Now, he saw the truth; he knew it.\nAfter a few seconds, he raised his head, and looked at Madame\nd'Imblevalle as naturally as he could. She was pale--with that unusual\npallor which invades us in the relentless moments of our lives. Her\nhands, which she endeavored to conceal, were trembling as if stricken\nwith palsy.\n\n\"One minute more,\" thought Sholmes, \"and she will betray herself.\"\n\nHe placed himself between her and her husband in the desire to avert the\nawful danger which, _through his fault_, now threatened that man and\nwoman. But, at sight of the baron, he was shocked to the very centre of\nhis soul. The same dreadful idea had entered the mind of Monsieur\nd'Imblevalle. The same thought was at work in the brain of the husband.\nHe understood, also! He saw the truth!\n\nIn desperation, Alice Demun hurled herself against the implacable truth,\nsaying:\n\n\"You are right, monsieur. I made a mistake. I did not enter by this\ndoor. I came through the garden and the vestibule ... by aid of a\nladder--\"\n\nIt was a supreme effort of true devotion. But a useless effort! The\nwords rang false. The voice did not carry conviction, and the poor girl\nno longer displayed those clear, fearless eyes and that natural air of\ninnocence which had served her so well. Now, she bowed her\nhead--vanquished.\n\nThe silence became painful. Madame d'Imblevalle was waiting for her\nhusband's next move, overwhelmed with anxiety and fear. The baron\nappeared to be struggling against the dreadful suspicion, as if he would\nnot submit to the overthrow of his happiness. Finally, he said to his\nwife:\n\n\"Speak! Explain!\"\n\n\"I have nothing to tell you,\" she replied, in a very low voice, and with\nfeatures drawn by anguish.\n\n\"So, then ... Mademoiselle....\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle saved me ... through devotion ... through affection ...\nand accused herself....\"\n\n\"Saved you from what? From whom?\"\n\n\"From that man.\"\n\n\"Bresson?\"\n\n\"Yes; it was I whom he held in fear by threats.... I met him at one of\nmy friends'.... and I was foolish enough to listen to him. Oh! there was\nnothing that you cannot pardon. But I wrote him two letters ... letters\nwhich you will see.... I had to buy them back ... you know how.... Oh!\nhave pity on me!... I have suffered so much!\"\n\n\"You! You! Suzanne!\"\n\nHe raised his clenched fists, ready to strike her, ready to kill her.\nBut he dropped his arms, and murmured:\n\n\"You, Suzanne.... You!... Is it possible?\"\n\nBy short detached sentences, she related the heartrending story, her\ndreadful awakening to the infamy of the man, her remorse, her fear, and\nshe also told of Alice's devotion; how the young girl divined the sorrow\nof her mistress, wormed a confession out of her, wrote to Lupin, and\ndevised the scheme of the theft in order to save her from Bresson.\n\n\"You, Suzanne, you,\" repeated Monsieur d'Imblevalle, bowed with grief\nand shame.... \"How could you?\"\n\n*****\n\nOn the same evening, the steamer \"City of London,\" which plies between\nCalais and Dover, was gliding slowly over the smooth sea. The night was\ndark; the wind was fainter than a zephyr. The majority of the passengers\nhad retired to their cabins; but a few, more intrepid, were promenading\non the deck or sleeping in large rocking-chairs, wrapped in their\ntravelling-rugs. One could see, here and there, the light of a cigar,\nand one could hear, mingled with the soft murmur of the breeze, the\nfaint sound of voices which were carefully subdued to harmonize with the\ndeep silence of the night.\n\nOne of the passengers, who had been pacing to and fro upon the deck,\nstopped before a woman who was lying on a bench, scrutinized her, and,\nwhen she moved a little, he said:\n\n\"I thought you were asleep, Mademoiselle Alice.\"\n\n\"No, Monsieur Sholmes, I am not sleepy. I was thinking.\"\n\n\"Of what? If I may be so bold as to inquire?\"\n\n\"I was thinking of Madame d'Imblevalle. She must be very unhappy. Her\nlife is ruined.\"\n\n\"Oh! no, no,\" he replied quickly. \"Her mistake was not a serious one.\nMonsieur d'Imblevalle will forgive and forget it. Why, even before we\nleft, his manner toward her had softened.\"\n\n\"Perhaps ... but he will remember it for a long time ... and she will\nsuffer a great deal.\"\n\n\"You love her?\"\n\n\"Very much. It was my love for her that gave me strength to smile when I\nwas trembling from fear, that gave me courage to look in your face when\nI desired to hide from your sight.\"\n\n\"And you are sorry to leave her?\"\n\n\"Yes, very sorry. I have no relatives, no friends--but her.\"\n\n\"You will have friends,\" said the Englishman, who was affected by her\nsorrow. \"I have promised that. I have relatives ... and some influence.\nI assure you that you will have no cause to regret coming to England.\"\n\n\"That may be, monsieur, but Madame d'Imblevalle will not be there.\"\n\nHerlock Sholmes resumed his promenade upon the deck. After a few\nminutes, he took a seat near his travelling companion, filled his pipe,\nand struck four matches in a vain effort to light it. Then, as he had no\nmore matches, he arose and said to a gentleman who was sitting near him:\n\n\"May I trouble you for a match?\"\n\nThe gentleman opened a box of matches and struck one. The flame lighted\nup his face. Sholmes recognized him--it was Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin.\n\nIf the Englishman had not given an almost imperceptible movement of\nsurprise, Lupin would have supposed that his presence on board had been\nknown to Sholmes, so well did he control his feelings and so natural was\nthe easy manner in which he extended his hand to his adversary.\n\n\"How's the good health, Monsieur Lupin?\"\n\n\"Bravo!\" exclaimed Lupin, who could not repress a cry of admiration at\nthe Englishman's sang-froid.\n\n\"Bravo? and why?\"\n\n\"Why? Because I appear before you like a ghost, only a few hours after\nyou saw me drowned in the Seine; and through pride--a quality that is\nessentially English--you evince not the slightest surprise. You greet\nme as a matter of course. Ah! I repeat: Bravo! Admirable!\"\n\n\"There is nothing remarkable about it. From the manner in which you fell\nfrom the boat, I knew very well that you fell voluntarily, and that the\nbullet had not touched you.\"\n\n\"And you went away without knowing what had become of me?\"\n\n\"What had become of you? Why, I knew that. There were at least five\nhundred people on the two banks of the river within a space of\nhalf-a-mile. If you escaped death, your capture was certain.\"\n\n\"And yet I am here.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Lupin, there are two men in the world at whom I am never\nastonished: in the first place, myself--and then, Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin.\"\n\nThe treaty of peace was concluded.\n\nIf Sholmes had not been successful in his contests with Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin; if\nLupin remained the only enemy whose capture he must never hope to\naccomplish; if, in the course of their struggles, he had not always\ndisplayed a superiority, the Englishman had, none the less, by means of\nhis extraordinary intuition and tenacity, succeeded in recovering the\nJewish lamp as well as the blue diamond.\n\nThis time, perhaps, the finish had not been so brilliant, especially\nfrom the stand-point of the public spectators, since Sholmes was obliged\nto maintain a discreet silence in regard to the circumstances in which\nthe Jewish lamp had been recovered, and to announce that he did not know\nthe name of the thief. But as man to man, Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin against Herlock\nSholmes, detective against burglar, there was neither victor nor\nvanquished. Each of them had won corresponding victories.\n\nTherefore they could now converse as courteous adversaries who had lain\ndown their arms and held each other in high regard.\n\nAt Sholmes' request, Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin related the strange story of his\nescape.\n\n\"If I may dignify it by calling it an escape,\" he said. \"It was so\nsimple! My friends were watching for me, as I had asked them to meet me\nthere to recover the Jewish lamp. So, after remaining a good half-hour\nunder the overturned boat, I took advantage of an occasion when\nFolenfant and his men were searching for my dead body along the bank of\nthe river, to climb on top of the boat. Then my friends simply picked me\nup as they passed by in their motor-boat, and we sailed away under the\nstaring eyes of an astonished multitude, including Ganimard and\nFolenfant.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" exclaimed Sholmes, \"very neatly played. And now you have\nsome business in England?\"\n\n\"Yes, some accounts to square up.... But I forgot ... what about\nMonsieur d'Imblevalle?\"\n\n\"He knows everything.\"\n\n\"All! my dear Sholmes, what did I tell you? The wrong is now\nirreparable. Would it not have been better to have allowed me to carry\nout the affair in my own way? In a day or two more, I should have\nrecovered the stolen goods from Bresson, restored them to Monsieur\nd'Imblevalle, and those two honest citizens would have lived together in\npeace and happiness ever after. Instead of that--\"\n\n\"Instead of that,\" said Sholmes, sneeringly, \"I have mixed the cards and\nsown the seeds of discord in the bosom of a family that was under your\nprotection.\"\n\n\"Mon Dieu! of course, I was protecting them. Must a person steal, cheat\nand wrong all the time?\"\n\n\"Then you do good, also?\"\n\n\"When I have the time. Besides, I find it amusing. Now, for instance,\nin our last adventure, I found it extremely diverting that I should be\nthe good genius seeking to help and save unfortunate mortals, while you\nwere the evil genius who dispensed only despair and tears.\"\n\n\"Tears! Tears!\" protested Sholmes.\n\n\"Certainly! The d'Imblevalle household is demolished, and Alice Demun\nweeps.\"\n\n\"She could not remain any longer. Ganimard would have discovered her\nsome day, and, through her, reached Madame d'Imblevalle.\"\n\n\"Quite right, monsieur; but whose fault is it?\"\n\nTwo men passed by. Sholmes said to Lupin, in a friendly tone:\n\n\"Do you know those gentlemen?\"\n\n\"I thought I recognized one of them as the captain of the steamer.\"\n\n\"And the other?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"It is Austin Gilett, who occupies in London a position similar to that\nof Monsieur Dudouis in Paris.\"\n\n\"Ah! how fortunate! Will you be so kind as to introduce me? Monsieur\nDudouis is one of my best friends, and I shall be delighted to say as\nmuch of Monsieur Austin Gilett.\"\n\nThe two gentlemen passed again.\n\n\"And if I should take you at your word, Monsieur Lupin?\" said Sholmes,\nrising, and seizing Lupin's wrist with a hand of iron.\n\n\"Why do you grasp me so tightly, monsieur? I am quite willing to follow\nyou.\"\n\nIn fact, he allowed himself to be dragged along without the least\nresistance. The two gentlemen were disappearing from sight. Sholmes\nquickened his pace. His finger-nails even sank into Lupin's flesh.\n\n\"Come! Come!\" he exclaimed, with a sort of feverish haste, in harmony\nwith his action. \"Come! quicker than that.\"\n\nBut he stopped suddenly. Alice Demun was following them.\n\n\"What are you doing, Mademoiselle? You need not come. You must not\ncome!\"\n\nIt was Lupin who replied:\n\n\"You will notice, monsieur, that she is not coming of her own free will.\nI am holding her wrist in the same tight grasp that you have on mine.\"\n\n\"Why!\"\n\n\"Because I wish to present her also. Her part in the affair of the\nJewish lamp is much more important than mine. Accomplice of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne\nLupin, accomplice of Bresson, she has a right to tell her adventure with\nthe Baroness d'Imblevalle--which will deeply interest Monsieur Gilett as\nan officer of the law. And by introducing her also, you will have\ncarried your gracious intervention to the very limit, my dear Sholmes.\"\n\nThe Englishman released his hold on his prisoner's wrist. Lupin\nliberated Mademoiselle.\n\nThey stood looking at each other for a few seconds, silently and\nmotionless. Then Sholmes returned to the bench and sat down, followed by\nLupin and the girl. After a long silence, Lupin said: \"You see,\nmonsieur, whatever we may do, we will never be on the same side. You are\non one side of the fence; I am on the other. We can exchange greetings,\nshake hands, converse a moment, but the fence is always there. You will\nremain Herlock Sholmes, detective, and I, Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin,\ngentleman-burglar. And Herlock Sholmes will ever obey, more or less\nspontaneously, with more or less propriety, his instinct as a detective,\nwhich is to pursue the burglar and run him down, if possible. And Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne\nLupin, in obedience to his burglarious instinct, will always be\noccupied in avoiding the reach of the detective, and making sport of the\ndetective, if he can do it. And, this time, he can do it. Ha-ha-ha!\"\n\nHe burst into a loud laugh, cunning, cruel and odious.\n\nThen, suddenly becoming serious, he addressed Alice Demun:\n\n\"You may be sure, mademoiselle, even when reduced to the last extremity,\nI shall not betray you. Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin never betrays anyone--especially\nthose whom he loves and admires. And, may I be permitted to say, I love\nand admire the brave, dear woman you have proved yourself to be.\"\n\nHe took from his pocket a visiting card, tore it in two, gave one-half\nof it to the girl, as he said, in a voice shaken with emotion:\n\n\"If Monsieur Sholmes' plans for you do not succeed, mademoiselle, go to\nLady Strongborough--you can easily find her address--and give her that\nhalf of the card, and, at the same time, say to her: _Faithful friend_.\nLady Strongborough will show you the true devotion of a sister.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the girl; \"I shall see her to-morrow.\"\n\n\"And now, Monsieur Sholmes,\" exclaimed Lupin, with the satisfied air of\na gentleman who has fulfilled his duty, \"I will say good-night. We will\nnot land for an hour yet, so I will get that much rest.\"\n\nHe lay down on the bench, with his hands beneath his head.\n\nIn a short time the high cliffs of the English coast loomed up in the\nincreasing light of a new-born day. The passengers emerged from the\ncabins and crowded the deck, eagerly gazing on the approaching shore.\nAustin Gilette passed by, accompanied by two men whom Sholmes recognized\nas sleuths from Scotland Yard.\n\nLupin was asleep, on his bench.\n\nTHE END.\n\n_The further startling, wonderful and thrilling adventures of \"Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne\nLupin\" will be found in the book entitled \"Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin\nGentleman-Burglar\"._\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Lupin versus Herlock Sholmes, by\nMaurice LeBlanc\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ARSENE LUPIN VS HERLOCK SHOLMES ***\n\n***** This file should be named 40203-8.txt or 40203-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/4\/0\/2\/0\/40203\/\n\nProduced by Sr Bianca Tempt & Marc D'Hooghe at\nhttp:\/\/www.freeliterature.org (Images generously made\navailable by the Internet Archive.)\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":358,"split":"train"}
