{"ori_id":"dd9cf023bdd235307eae3ce78acccef6eff1e18c","title":"The Tangled Skein","context":"The Tangled Skein\n In The Tangled Skein, Queen Mary is characterized as a loving woman with a strong sense of justice.\nThe tangled skein arises from Mary\u2019s love for the fictional character Robert d\u2019Esclade, fifth Duke of Wessex, said in this book to be the people's choice as King Consort. Wessex is chivalrous and charming, but semi-betrothed to Lady Ursula Glynde, whom he has not seen since her infancy. Wessex is repelled by the idea of having his wife thrust upon him and purposely avoids Lady Ursula. Unknown to Wessex, the Queen jealously guards him against Ursula, who is extremely beautiful.\nAs soon as she realizes the Queen is keeping her away from Wessex, Ursula is angered. She believes she loves Wessex, for his nobility and goodness, and she is invested heavily in the betrothal. On her father\u2019s deathbed, Ursula promised to go into a convent if she did not marry Wessex. Although Ursula does not want to lose her independence by marrying, she seeks to frustrate the Queen\u2019s plans and make Wessex notice her; however, the arrival of Cardinal de Moreno, and his henchman Don Mignel, Marquis de Saurez, shifts the scene.\nThe Cardinal is in England to negotiate the marriage between Philip II of Spain and Mary. To end the Queen's love for Wessex, the Cardinal tries to marry Wessex and Lady Ursula. But when the Queen discovers the ruse, she declares that his Eminence should leave England immediately; she will not marry Philip. Then the Cardinal has to set to work to part the lovers, a far more difficult and intricate business than bringing them together.\nIt costs a life, Wessex his freedom, and Lady Ursula her good name before it can be effected. The skein is more hopelessly tangled than before, and still Mary remains obdurate. The Queen loses her dignity, will and love. The Cardinal\u2019s victory is gained at the expense of his own career.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's The Tangled Skein, by Emmuska Orczy, Baroness Orczy\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Noailles, who detested England as the land of humid\natmospheres and ill-dressed women!\n\nRenard, who was more of a diplomatist and kept his opinions on the fogs\nand wenches of Old England very much to himself, declared\nenthusiastically in his letter to the Emperor Charles V, dated October\n2nd, 1553, that never had he seen the sky so blue, the sun so bright,\nnor the people of this barbarous island more merry than on the memorable\nfirst day of East Molesey Fair: as all who will, may read for themselves\nin Vol. III of the Granvelle Papers:--\n\n\"_Aulcungs ne pourroient contempler ciel plus bleu soleil plus\nbrillianct ni peuple plus joieult._\"\n\nYet what have we to do with the opinions of these noble ambassadors of\ngreat and mighty foreign monarchs?\n\nOur own chroniclers tell us that East Molesey Fair was the maddest,\nmerriest, happiest time the goodly folk of the Thames Valley had had\nwithin memory of the oldest inhabitant.\n\nWas not good Queene Marye, beloved daughter of the great King Henry\nVIII, crowned at last? crowned in Westminster Abbey, as all her loyal\nsubjects had desired that she should be, despite His Grace of\nNorthumberland and his treasonable faction, whom God and the Queene's\nmost lawful Majesty would punish all in good time?\n\nIn the meanwhile let us be joyful and make merry!\n\nSuch a motley crowd as never was seen. Here's a sheriff from London\nCity, pompous and dignified in dark doublet and hose, with scarlet\nmantle and velvet cap; beside him his lady trips right merrily, her\ndamask kirtle held well above her high-heeled shoes, her flowered\npaniers looped in the latest style, with just the suggestion of a\nfarthingale beneath her robes, to give dignity to her figure and value\nto the slimness of her waist.\n\nHere a couple of solemn burgesses in velvet cloaks edged with fur, and\nrichly slashed doublets, are discussing the latest political events;\nwhilst a group of Hampton merchants, more soberly clad, appraise the\nwares of a cutler lately hailed from Spain.\n\nThen the dames and maidens with puffed paniers of blue or vivid scarlet,\nmoving swiftly from booth to booth, babbling like so many gaily-plumaged\nbirds, squabbling with the vendors and chaffing the criers.\n\nHere and there the gaudy uniform of one of the liveried Companies will\nattract the eye, anon the dark cloak and close black mask which\nobviously hides the Court gallant.\n\nMen of all ranks and of all stations have come out to East Molesey\nto-day. Merchants, shopkeepers, workers, aldermen and servants, all with\ntheir womenkind, all with pouches more or less well filled, for who\nwould go to Molesey Fair but to spend money, to drink, to eat, or to\nmake merry?\n\nThen there were the 'prentices!\n\nThey had no money to spend, save a copper or so to throw to a\nmountebank, but nevertheless they contrived to enjoy themselves right\nroyally.\n\nSuch imps of mischief!\n\nNo whipping-post to-day! Full licence for all their pranks and madcap\njokes. The torment of all these worthy burgesses out on a holiday.\n\nOh! these 'prentices!\n\nHundreds of them out here this afternoon. They've come down from Esher\nand Hampton, Kingston and Westminster and London City, like so many\nbuzzing insects seeking whom they can annoy.\n\nNow on the ground, suddenly tripping a pompous dame off her feet; anon\nin rows, some half-dozen of them, elbow to elbow, head foremost,\ncharging the more serious crowd, and with a hoot and a yell scattering\nit like a number of frightened goslings. Yet again at the confect booth,\nto the distraction of the vendors of honey-cakes, stealing sugar-plums\nand damson cheese, fighting, quarrelling, screeching, their thin legs\nencased in hose of faded blue or grey worsted, their jerkins loose,\ntheir shirt sleeves flapping in the breeze, a cool note of white amidst\nthe dark-coloured gowns of the older men.\n\nHeavens above! what a to-do!\n\nA group of women be-coiffed, apparelled in best kirtles and modish\nshoes, were pressing round a booth where pantoufles, embroidered\npouches, kerchiefs, and velveted paniers were laid out in tempting\narray.\n\nJust beyond, a number of buxom country wenches, with round red arms,\nshowing bare to the grilling sun, and laughing eyes, aglow with\nill-concealed gourmandise, were gaping at a mighty display of pullets,\nhares, and pigeons, sides of roebuck and haunches of wild boar, ready\nspiked, trussed, and skewered, fit to tempt Her Majesty's Grace's own\nroyal palate.\n\nSprigs of sweet-scented marjoram, thyme, and wool-blade tastefully\ndisposed, further enhanced the attractions of this succulent show. 'Twas\nenough to make the sweetest mouth water with anticipatory delight. A\nbrown-eyed, apple-cheeked wench in paniers of brilliant red was\nunaffectedly licking her pretty lips.\n\n\"This way, mistress, this way!\" shouted the vendor of these appetizing\nwares. A sturdy fellow, he, with ginger-coloured pate, and wielding a\nlong narrow-bladed knife in his fleshy hand. \"This way! a haunch of buck\nfrom the royal venery! a hare from Her Liege Majesty's own chase! a\npullet from----\"\n\n\"Nay, thou gorbellied knave!\" responded a vendor of drugs and herbs\nclose by, whose stall was somewhat deserted, and whose temper was\nobviously suffering--\"Nay! an thou speakest the truth thou art a thief,\nbut if not, then thou'rt a liar! In either case art fit for the\nhangman's rope!\"\n\n\"This way, my masters! this way!\" came in loud, stentorian cries from a\nneighbouring booth; \"this way for Peter the juggler, the greatest\nconjurer the world has ever seen!\"\n\n\"This way! I pray you, worthy sirs!\" this from yet another place of\nentertainment, \"this way for John the tumbler!\"\n\n\"Peter the juggler will swallow a cross-bow of steel before your very\neyes!\" shouted one crier.\n\n\"John the tumbler will climb Saint Ethelburga's steeple without help of\nrope or ladder,\" called the other.\n\n\"Peter will show you how to shoe a turkey, how to put salt on a\nswallow's tail, and how to have your cake and eat it!\"\n\n\"John will sit on two stools without coming to the ground!\"\n\n\"Marry! and ye both lie faster than my mule can trot!\" came in hilarious\naccents from one of the crowd.\n\n\"And Peter the juggler will show thee how to make thy mule trot faster\nthan thou canst lie, friend,\" responded Peter's crier unabashed, \"and a\nmighty difficult task 'twill be, I'll warrant.\"\n\nLaughing, joking, ogling like some fickle jade, the crowd passed from\nbooth to booth: now dropping a few coins in Peter the juggler's hat, now\nwatching the antics of John the tumbler; anon looking on amazed, half\nterrified at the evolutions of a gigantic brown bear, led by the nose by\na vigorous knave in leather jerkin and cross-gartered hose, and\naccompanied by a youngster who was blowing on a mighty sackbut until his\ncheeks looked nigh to bursting.\n\nBut adsheart! who shall tell of all the attractions which were set forth\non that memorable day before the loyal subjects of good Queene Marye?\n\nThere were the trestles where one could play at ball and knuckle-bone,\nor chance and mumchance; another, where evens and odds and backgammon\nproved tempting. He who willed could tilt at Weekie, play quoits or\nlansquenet, at ball or at the billiards, or risk his coppers on such\ngames as one-and-thirty, or at the pass ten; he might try his skill,\ntoo, at throwing the dart, or his strength at putting the stone.\n\nThere were mountebanks and quacksalvers, lapidaries at work, and\nastrologers in their tents. For twopence one could have a bout with the\nback-sword or the Spanish tuck, could watch the situations and\nconjunctions of the fixed stars and the planets, could play a game of\ntennis or pelitrigone, or be combed and curled, perfumed and trimmed so\nas to please a dainty mistress's eye.\n\nAnd through it all the loud bang! bang! bang! of the big drums, the\ncriers proclaiming the qualities of their wares, the jarring notes of\nthe sackbut and the allman flute, the screechy viol and the strident\nnine-hole pipe, all playing against one another, each striving to drown\nthe other, and mingling with the laughter of the crowd, the yells of the\n'prentices, the babble of the women, formed a huge volume of\near-splitting cacophony which must have been heard from one end of the\ncountry to the other.\n\nAll was noise, merriment, and laughter, save in one spot--an\nout-of-the-way, half-hidden corner of the fair, where the sister\nstreams, the Ember and the Mole, join hands for a space, meet but to\npart again, and whence the distant towers and cupolas of Hampton Court\nappeared like those of a fairy palace floating in mid-ether, perched\nhigh aloft in the shimmering haze of this hot late summer's afternoon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE WITCH'S TENT\n\n\nThere are many accounts still extant of the various doings at East\nMolesey Fair on this 2nd of October in the year of our Lord 1553, and\nseveral chroniclers--Renard is conspicuous among the latter--make\nmention of the events which very nearly turned the gay and varying\ncomedies of that day into weird and tragic drama.\n\nCertainly the witch's tent was a mistake.\n\nBut what would you? No doubt the worthy individual, who for purposes of\nmystification called himself \"Abra,\" had tried many means of earning a\nlivelihood before he and his associate in business took to the\nlucrative, yet dangerous trade of necromancy.\n\nHe was tall and gaunt, with hooked nose and deep-sunk eyes; he had\ncultivated a long, grey beard, and could call forth the powers of Mirrab\nthe Witch with a remarkably solemn and guttural voice.\n\nAs for Mirrab herself, no one was allowed to see her. That was part of\nthe business. She was a witch, a dealer in magic potions, charms and\nphilters, a reader of the stars, and--softly be it spoken--a friend and\ncompanion of the devil! She only appeared enveloped in a thick veil,\nwith divining wand held lightly in her hand, the ends of her gold\ntresses alone visible below the heavy covering which swathed her head.\n\nIt was the mystery of it all--cheap devices at best--which from the\nfirst had irritated the country-folk who thronged the Fair.\n\nThe tent itself was unlike any other ever seen at East Molesey. It stood\nhigh upon a raised wooden platform, to which a few rough steps gave\naccess. On the right was a tall flagstaff, with black flag emblazoned\nwith white skull and cross-bones, fluttering lazily in the breeze.\n\nOn the left a huge elm tree, with great heavy branches overshadowing the\ntent, had been utilized to support a placard bearing the words--\n\n      \"Mirrab! the World-famed Necromancer!\n       Sale of Magic Charms and Love Philters\n       Horoscope Casting and Elixir of Life!\"\n\nPerched on the platform, and assisted by a humbler henchman, armed with\nbig drum and cymbals, the worthy Abra, in high-peaked cap and flowing\nmantle covered with strange devices, had all day long invited customers\nto his booth by uttering strange, mysterious promises.\n\n\"This way, this way, my masters,\" he would say with imposing solemnity;\n\"the world-famous necromancer, Mirrab, will evoke for you the spirits of\nMars, of Saturn, or of the moon.\"\n\n\"She will show you the Grand Grimorium.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0!\"\n\nNow what was the Grand Grimorium? The very sound of the words suggested\nsome agency of the devil; no Christian man had ever heard or spoken of\nthe Grand Grimorium.\n\n\"She will show you the use of the blasting rod and the divining wand.\nShe will call forth the elementary spirits. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nSome people would try to laugh. Who had ever heard of the elementary\nspirits? Perhaps if some of the more enlightened town worthies happened\nto be nigh the booth, one or two of them would begin to chaff the\nnecromancer.\n\n\"And prithee, friend wizard,\" a solemn burgher would suggest, \"prithee\nwhat are the elementary spirits?\"\n\nBut Abra was nothing if not ready-witted.\n\n\"The elementary spirits,\" he would explain with imperturbable gravity,\n\"are the green butterfly, the black pullet, the queen of the hairy\nflies, and the screech owl.\"\n\nThe weird nomenclature was enough to make any one's hair stand on end.\nEven the sedate burgesses would shake their heads and silently edge\naway, whilst their womenkind would run swiftly past the booth, muttering\na quick _Ave_ to the blessed Virgin or kissing the Holy Scapulary hung\nbeneath their kerchiefs, as their terrified glances met the cabalistic\nsigns on the black flag.\n\nThe humbler country-folk frankly spat upon the ground three times\nwhenever they caught sight of the flag, and that is a sure way of\nsending the devil about his business.\n\nThe shadows now were beginning to lengthen.\n\nThe towers and cupolas of Hampton Court Palace were studded with gold\nand gems by the slanting rays of the setting sun.\n\nIt had been a glorious afternoon and, except in the open space\nimmediately in front of the witch's tent, the fun of the fair had lost\nnone of its zest.\n\nThe witch's booth alone was solitary--weird-looking beneath the\nspreading branches of the overhanging elm.\n\nThe tent seemed lighted from within, for as the evening breeze stirred\nits hangings, gleams of brilliant red, more glowing than the sunset,\nappeared in zigzag streaks between its folds.\n\nBehind, and to the right and left of it, the gentle murmur of the sister\nstreams sounded like ghostly whisperings of evening sprites, busy\nspreading their grey mantles over the distant landscape.\n\nAs the afternoon wore on, the crowd in the other parts of the Fair had\ngrown more and more dense, and now, among the plainer garb of the\nburgesses and townsfolk, and the jerkins and worsted hose of the yokels,\ncould be seen quite frequently a silken doublet or velvet trunk, a\nmasked face perhaps beneath a plumed bonnet, or the point of a sword\ngleaming beneath the long, dark mantle, denoting the Court gallant.\n\nNow and then, too, hooded and closely swathed forms would flit quickly\nthrough the crowd, followed by the inquisitive glances of the humbler\nfolk, as the dainty tip of a broidered shoe or the richly wrought hem of\na silken kirtle, protruding below the cloak, betrayed the lady of rank\nand fashion on gay adventure bent.\n\nMost of these veiled figures had found their way up the rough wooden\nsteps which led to the witch's tent. The fame of Mirrab, the Soothsayer,\nhad reached the purlieus of the palace, and Abra, the magician, had more\nthan once seen his lean palm crossed with gold.\n\n\"This way, noble lords! this way!\"\n\nHe was even now trying to draw the attention of two cloaked figures, who\nhad just emerged in sight of the booth.\n\nTwo gentlemen of the Court evidently, for Abra's quick eye had caught a\nglimpse of richly chased sword-hilts, as the wind blew the heavy, dark\nmantles to one side.\n\nBut these gentlemen were paying little heed to the worthy magician's\nblandishments. They were whispering excitedly to one another, whilst\neagerly scanning the crowd all round them.\n\n\"They were ladies from the Court, I feel sure,\" said the taller man of\nthe two; \"I swear I have seen the hem of that kirtle before.\"\n\n\"Carramba!\" replied the other, \"it promised well, but methinks we've\nlost track of them now.\"\n\nHe spoke English very fluently, yet with a strong, guttural intonation,\nwhilst the well-known Spanish oath which he uttered betrayed his\nnationality.\n\n\"Pardi!\" he added impatiently, \"I could have sworn that the damsels were\nbent on consulting the witch.\"\n\n\"Nay, only on seeing the fun of the Fair apparently,\" rejoined the\nother; \"we've lain in wait here now for nigh on half an hour.\"\n\n\"Mirrab the Soothsayer will evoke for you the spirits of the moon, oh\nnoble lords!\" urged Abra, with ever-increasing persuasiveness. \"She will\ngive you the complaisance of the entire female sex.\"\n\n\"What say you, my lord,\" said the Englishman after a while, \"shall we\ngive up the quest after those elusive damsels and woo these obliging\nspirits of the moon? They say the witch has marvellous powers.\"\n\n\"Bah, milor!\" rejoined the Spaniard gaily, \"a veiled female! Think on\nit! Those who have entered yon mysterious tent declare that scarce an\noutline of that soothsayer could they glean, beneath the folds of thick\ndraperies which hide her from view. What is a shapeless woman? I ask\nyou, milor. And in England, too,\" he added with affected gallantry which\nhad more than a touch of sarcasm in it, \"where all women are shapely.\"\n\n\"Mirrab, the world-famous necromancer, will bring to your arms the lady\nof your choice, oh most noble lords!\" continued the persistent Abra,\n\"even if she were hidden beyond the outermost corners of the earth.\"\n\n\"By my halidame! this decides me,\" quoth the Englishman merrily. \"I pray\nyou come, my lord. This adventure promises better than the other. And,\nwho knows?\" he added in his turn with thinly-veiled, pleasant irony,\n\"you Spaniards are so persuasive--the witch, if she be young and fair,\nmight lift her veil for you.\"\n\n\"Allons!\" responded the other, \"since 'tis your wish, milor, let us\nconsult the spirits.\"\n\nAnd, standing aside with the courtly grace peculiar to those of his\nnationality, he allowed his companion to precede him up the steps which\nled to Mirrab's tent.\n\nThen he too followed, and laughing and chattering the two men\ndisappeared behind the gaudily painted draperies.\n\nNot, however, without tossing a couple of gold pieces into the hands of\nthe wizard. Abra, obsequious, smiling, thoroughly contented, sat himself\ndown to rest awhile beside his patient, hard-worked henchman.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nMISCHIEF BREWING\n\n\nAt some little distance from the mysterious booth a trestle table had\nbeen erected, at which some three or four wenches in hooped paniers and\nshort, striped kirtles, were dispensing spiced ale and sack to the\nthirsty village folk.\n\nHere it was that Mirrab the witch and her attendant wizard were most\nfreely discussed--with bated breath, and with furtive glances cast\nhurriedly at the black flag, which was just visible above the row of\nother booths and gayer attractions of the Fair.\n\nThere was no doubt that as the evening began to draw in, and the sun to\nsink lower and lower in the west, the superstitious terror, which had\nall along set these worthy country yokels against the awesome mysteries\nof the necromancer's tent, had gradually culminated into a hysterical\nfrenzy.\n\nAt first sullen looks had been cast towards that distant spot, whence\nthe sound of Abra's perpetual \"This way, noble lords, this way!\" came\nevery now and then as a weird and ghostly echo; but now muttered curses\nand even a threatening gesture from time to time had taken the place of\nangry silence.\n\nAs the hard pates of these louts became heated with the foaming ale,\ntheir tempers began to rise, and the girls, with characteristic love of\nmischief and gossip, were ready enough to add fuel to the smouldering\nflames.\n\nThere was also present in the minds of these wenches an obvious feeling\nof jealousy against this mysterious veiled witch, who had proved so\nattractive to the Court gallants who visited the Fair.\n\nHer supposed charms so carefully hidden beneath thick draperies, were\nreputed to be irresistible, and Mistress Dorothy, Susan, and Joan, who\nshowed their own pretty faces unblushingly, were not sufficiently versed\nin mountebanks' tricks to realize that Mirrab's thick veil was, without\ndoubt, only a means for arousing the jaded curiosity of idlers from the\nCourt.\n\nBe that as it may, it was an established fact that no one had seen the\nsoothsayer's face, and that Mistress Dorothy, who was pouring out a huge\ntankard of sack for her own attendant swain, was exceedingly annoyed\nthereby.\n\n\"Bah!\" she said contemptuously, as Abra and his magic devices were being\ndiscussed at the table, \"he is but a lout. I tell thee, Matthew, that\nthou'rt a fool to take count of him. But the woman,\" she added under her\nbreath, \"is possessed of the devil.\"\n\nMatthew, the shoemaker, took the tankard, which his sweetheart had\nfilled for him, in both hands and took a long draught before he made any\nreply. Then he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, spat upon the\nground, and looked significantly at the circle of friends who were\ngathered round him.\n\n\"I tell you, my masters,\" he said at last with due solemnity, \"that I\nsaw that witch last night fly out from yonder tree astride upon a giant\nbat.\"\n\n\"A bat?\"\n\nA holy shudder went round the entire assembly. Pretty Mistress Susan\ncrossed herself furtively, whilst Joan in her terror nearly dropped the\nhandful of mugs which she was carrying.\n\nEvery one hung on the shoemaker's lips.\n\nShort and somewhat tubby of body, Matthew had a round and chubby face,\nwith pale blue, bulging eyes, and slightly elevated eyebrows, which gave\nhim the appearance of an overgrown baby. He was for some reason, which\nhas never transpired to this day, reputed to have wonderful wisdom. His\nitems of news, gleaned from a nephew who was scullion in the royal\nkitchen, were always received with boundless respect, whilst the\nconnection itself gave him a certain social superiority of which he was\nproudly conscious.\n\nLike the true-born orator, Matthew had paused a moment in order to allow\nthe full strength of his utterance to sink into the minds of his\nhearers.\n\n\"Aye!\" he said after a while, \"she flew out from between the branches\nand up towards the full moon, clad only----\"\n\nA brusque movement and a blush from Mistress Dorothy here stopped the\ngraphic flow of his eloquence.\n\n\"Er--hem--!\" he concluded more tamely, \"I saw her quite plainly.\"\n\n\"More shame then on thee, master,\" retorted Dorothy, whose wrath was far\nfrom subsiding, \"for thus gazing on the devil's work.\"\n\nBut the matter had become of far too great import to allow of feminine\njealousies being taken into account.\n\n\"And I know,\" added an elderly matron with quaking voice, \"that my\nsister Hannah's child caught sight of the witch outside her tent this\nmorning, and forthwith fell into convulsions, the poor innocent lamb.\"\n\n\"She hath the evil eye, depend on it,\" quoth Dorothy decisively.\n\nThe men said nothing. They were sipping their ale in sullen silence, and\nlooking to Matthew for further expressions of wisdom.\n\n\"Those evil spirits have oft a filthy countenance,\" explained the\nshoemaker sententiously, \"and no doubt 'twas they helped to convulse\nMistress Hannah's child. Some have four faces--one in the usual place,\nanother at the back of the head, and one looking out on either side;\nothers appear with a tall and lean body and bellow like a bull.\"\n\n\"Hast seen them, Matthew?\" came in awed whispers from those around.\n\n\"Nay! God and the Holy Virgin forbid!\" protested Matthew fervently. \"God\nforbid that I should enter their abode of evil. I should lose my soul.\"\n\nThere was a long, ominous silence, broken only by quickly muttered\ninvocations to the saints and to Our Lady.\n\nThe men looked furtively at one another. The women clung together, not\ndaring to utter a sound. Mistress Dorothy, all the boldness gone out of\nher little heart, was sobbing from sheer fright.\n\n\"Friends,\" said Matthew at last, as if with sudden resolution, \"if that\nwoman be possessed of the devil, what's to be done?\"\n\nThere was no reply, but obviously they all understood one another, for\neach wore a shame-faced look all of a sudden, and dared not meet his\nneighbour's eye. But the danger was great. The devil in their midst\nwould mean poisoned wells, the sweating sickness, some dire calamity for\nsure; and it was the duty of every true-hearted countryman to protect\nhis home and family from such terrible disasters.\n\nTherefore when Matthew in his wisdom said, \"What's to be done?\" the men\nfully understood.\n\nThe women, too, knew that mischief was brewing. They drew closer to one\nanother and shivered with cold beneath their kerchiefs, in spite of the\nwarmth of this beautiful late summer's afternoon.\n\n\"Beware of her, Matthew,\" entreated Mistress Dorothy tearfully.\n\nShe drew a small piece of blue cloth from the bosom of her dress: it was\npinked and broidered, and had the image of the Holy Virgin painted on\none side of it. Quickly she slipped it under her lover's jerkin.\n\n\"Take it,\" she whispered, \"the scapulary of Our Lady will protect thee.\"\n\nThis momentous conclave was here interrupted by the approach of the\nsmall detachment of the town guard which had been sent hither to ensure\norder amongst the holiday-makers.\n\nMatthew and his friends began ostentatiously to talk of the weather and\nother such trifling matters, until after the guard had passed, then once\nmore they put their heads together.\n\nBut this time they bade the women go. What had to be discussed now was\nmen's work and unfit for wenches' ears.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nFRIENDS AND ENEMIES\n\n\nIn the meanwhile the two gallants were returning from their visit to the\nwitch's tent.\n\nAs they came down the steps more than one voice among the passers-by\ninquired eagerly--\n\n\"What fortune, sirs?\"\n\n\"In truth she hath strange powers,\" was the somewhat guarded response.\n\nThe two men strolled up to a neighbouring wine-vendor and ordered some\nwine. They had thrown their cloaks aside and removed their masks, for\nthe air was close. The rich, slashed doublets, thus fully displayed, the\nfine lace at throat and wrist, the silken hose and chased daggers, all\nbetokened the high quality and wealth of the wearers.\n\nNeither of them seemed much above thirty years of age; each had the air\nof a man in the prime of life, and in the full enjoyment of all the good\nthings which the world can give.\n\nBut in their actual appearance they presented a marked contrast.\n\nThe one tall and broad-shouldered, florid of complexion, and somewhat\nreddish about the hair and small pointed beard; the other short,\nslender, and alert, with keen, restless eyes, and with sensuous lips for\never curled in a smile of thinly veiled sarcasm.\n\nThough outwardly on most familiar terms together, there was distinctly\napparent between the two men an air of reserve, and even of decided, if\nperhaps friendly, antagonism.\n\n\"Well, milor Everingham,\" said the Spaniard after a while, \"what say you\nto our adventure?\"\n\n\"I say first and foremost, my lord,\" replied Everingham with studied\ngallantry, \"that my prophecy proved correct--the mysterious necromancer\nwas no proof against Spanish wiles; she unveiled at a smile from Don\nMiguel, Marquis de Suarez, the envoy of His Most Catholic Majesty.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" rejoined Don Miguel, affecting not to notice the slight tone of\nsarcasm in his friend's pleasant voice, \"I scarce caught a glimpse of\nthe wench's face. The tent was so dark and her movements so swift.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence. Lord Everingham seemed lost in meditation.\n\n\"You are thoughtful, milor,\" remarked Don Miguel. \"Have the genii of the\nmoon conquered your own usually lively spirits?\"\n\n\"Nay, I was thinking of the curious resemblance,\" mused Everingham.\n\n\"A resemblance?--to whom?\"\n\n\"As you say, the tent was dark and the wench's movements swift, yet I\ncould see that, though coarsely clad and ill-kempt, that witch, whom\nthey call Mirrab, is the very physical counterpart of the new Court\nbeauty, the Lady Ursula Glynde.\"\n\n\"The fianc\u00c3\u00a9e of the Duke of Wessex!\" exclaimed the Spaniard.\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"Nay, my lord,\" rejoined Everingham pointedly, \"she scarce can be called\nHis Grace's fianc\u00c3\u00a9e as yet. They were children in their cradles when\n_her_ father plighted their troth.\"\n\nThe Spaniard made no immediate reply. With an affected, effeminate\ngesture he was gently stroking his long, black moustache. Everingham,\non the other hand, was eyeing him keenly, with a certain look of\ndefiance and challenge, and in a moment the antagonism between the two\nmen appeared more marked than before.\n\n\"But gossip has it,\" said the Marquis at last, with assumed nonchalance,\n\"that Lady Ursula's father--the Earl of Truro, was it not?--swore upon\nhis honour and on his deathbed that she should wed the Duke of Wessex,\nwhenever he claimed her hand, or live her life in a convent. Nay, I but\nrepeat the rumour which has reached me,\" he added lightly; \"put me right\nif I am in error, my lord. I am but a stranger, and have not yet had the\nhonour of meeting His Grace.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said Everingham impatiently, \"His Grace is in no humour to wed,\nnor do the Earl of Truro's deathbed vows bind _him_ in any way.\"\n\nHe took up his bumper, and looking long and thoughtfully into it, he\nsaid with slow emphasis--\n\n\"If the Duke of Wessex be inclined to marry, believe me, my lord\nMarquis, that it shall be none other than the Queen of England! Whom may\nGod bless and protect,\" he added, reverently lifting his plumed hat with\none hand, whilst with the other he held the bumper to his lips and\ntossed down the full measure of wine at one draught.\n\n\"Amen to that,\" responded Don Miguel with the same easy nonchalance.\n\nHe too drained his bumper to the dregs; then he said quietly--\n\n\"But that is where we differ, milor. His Eminence the Cardinal de Moreno\nand myself both hope that the Queen of England will wed our master King\nPhilip of Spain.\"\n\nEveringham seemed as if he would reply. But with a certain effort he\nchecked the impatient words which had risen to his lips. Englishmen had\nonly just begun to learn the tricks and wiles of Spanish diplomacy, the\nsmiles which hide antagonisms, the suave words which disguise impulsive\nthoughts.\n\nLord Everingham had not wholly assimilated the lesson. He had frowned\nimpatiently when the question of the marriage of his queen had been\nbroached by the foreigner. It was a matter which roused the temper of\nevery loyal Englishman just then; they would _not_ see Mary Tudor wedded\nto a stranger. England was beginning to feel her own independence; her\nchildren would not see her under another yoke.\n\nMary, in spite of her Spanish mother, was English to the backbone.\nTudor-like, she had proved her grit and her pluck when opposing factions\ntried to wrest her crown from her. She was Harry's daughter. Her loyal\nsubjects were proud of her and proud of her descent, and many of them\nhad sworn that none but an English husband should share her throne with\nher.\n\nWith the same sarcastic smile still lurking round his full lips the\nSpaniard had watched his friend closely the while. He knew full well\nwhat was going on behind that florid countenance, knew the antagonism\nwhich the proposed Spanish marriage was rousing just then in the hearts\nand minds of Englishmen of all classes.\n\nBut he certainly did not care to talk over such momentous questions at a\ncountry fair, with the eyes and mouths of hundreds of yokels gaping\nastonishment at him.\n\nAs far as he was concerned the half-amicable discussion was closed. He\nand his friend had agreed to differ. According to Spanish ideas,\ndivergence in political opinions need not interfere with pleasant\ncamaraderie.\n\nWith a genuine desire, therefore, to change the subject of conversation,\nDon Miguel rose from his seat and idly scanned the passing crowd.\n\n\"Carramba!\" he ejaculated suddenly.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Our two masks,\" whispered the Spaniard. \"What say you, milor, shall we\nresume our interrupted adventure and abandon the tiresome field of\npolitics for the more easy paths of gallantry?\"\n\nAnd without waiting for his friend's reply, eager, impetuous, fond of\nintrigues and mysteries, the young man darted through the crowd in the\ndirection where his keen eyes had spied a couple of hooded figures,\nthickly veiled, who were obviously trying to pass unperceived.\n\nEveringham followed closely on the young Spaniard's footsteps. But the\nsun had already sunk low down in the west. Outlines and silhouettes had\nbecome indistinct and elusive. By the time the Marquis de Suarez and his\nEnglish friend had elbowed their way through the throng the two\nmysterious figures had once more disappeared.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nLADIES AND GALLANTS\n\n\nBreathless, half laughing and half crying, very merry, yet wholly\nfrightened, those same two hooded and masked figures had paused almost\nimmediately beneath the platform of Mirrab's tent.\n\nThey had been running very fast, and, exhausted, were now clinging to\none another, cowering in the deepest shadow of the rough wooden\nconstruction.\n\n\"Oh! Margaret sweet,\" whispered a feminine voice from behind the silken\nmask, \"I vow I should have died with fright!\"\n\n\"Think you we have escaped them?\" murmured the other feebly.\n\nShe who had first spoken, taller than her friend and obviously the\nleader of this mad escapade, tiptoed cautiously forward and peered out\ninto the open space.\n\n\"Sh--sh--sh!\" she whispered, as she dragged her unwilling companion\nafter her, \"do you see them? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. right over there .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. they are\nrunning fast .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Oh! ho! ho! ho!\" she laughed suddenly with childish\nglee as she clapped her hands together; \"but, Margaret dear! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. did\nwe not fool them merrily? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Oh! I could shriek for joy! Aye, run,\nrun, run, my fine gallants!\" she added, blowing an imaginary kiss to her\ndistant pursuers, \"an you go that way you'll ne'er o'ertake us, e'en\nthough you raced the wind .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. ha! ha! ha! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHer laugh sounded a little forced and hysterical, for she had had a\nterrible fright, and her companion was still clinging miserably,\nhelplessly to her side.\n\n\"Nay, Ursula, how can you be so merry?\" admonished Margaret in a voice\nalmost choked with tears; \"think if the Duchess of Lincoln were to hear\nof this adventure--or Her Majesty herself--oh! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nBut Ursula's gay, madcap mood was proof against Margaret's tears.\n\n\"Oh! oh! oh!\" she ejaculated, mimicking her friend's tones of horror.\n\"Oh!\" she added with mock seriousness, \"well, then, of course, there\nwould be trouble, Margaret mine! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. sweet Margaret! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. such a\nlecture! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and oh! oh! oh! such black looks from Her Majesty! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nwe should e'en--think on it!--have to look demure for at least two days,\nuntil our sins be forgiven us! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nShe paused awhile, mischief apparent even beneath the half-transparent\nlace which hid her laughter-loving mouth. She drew her trembling\ncompanion closer to her, and, still laughing, she coaxed her gently.\n\n\"There, there, sweet,\" she murmured, \"cheer up, I pray thee, cheer up.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. See, we have come to the end of our journey. We have baffled those\npersistent gallants, and this is the witch's tent. Margaret!\" she added\nwith an impatient tap of the foot, \"art a goose to go on crying so? I\nvow I'd have come alone had I known thou'rt such a coward.\"\n\n\"Ursula!\" said Margaret, somewhat emboldened by her friend's assurance,\n\"could you guess who were those two gallants?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" replied Ursula indifferently, \"one of them, methinks, was the\nMarquis de Suarez, for I caught sight of his black silk hose, but what\ndo we care about these nincompoops, Margaret? Come and see the witch--we\nhave no time to lose.\"\n\nEagerly she turned towards the booth, and somewhat awed, anxious, yet\nnot wholly daring, she gazed up in astonishment at the gaudy draperies,\nthe tall flagstaff, the weird black flag with its strange device. Then\nwith sudden resolution she planted her foot upon the bottom step.\n\n\"Wilt follow me, sweet?\" she asked.\n\nEven as she spoke Abra, in tall peaked cap and flowing mantle, emerged\nfrom within the tent.\n\nMargaret, who was screwing up her courage to follow her friend, gave a\nshriek of dismay.\n\n\"No! no! no! Ursula!\" she said, clinging to the other girl, not daring\nto look up at the awesome figure of the lean magician. \"I implore you,\ngive up the thought.\"\n\n\"Give up the thought?\" rejoined Ursula, boldly trying to smother her own\nsuperstitious fears, \"when I've gone thus far?\"\n\n\"I cannot think what you want with that horrid witch!\" pleaded Margaret.\n\nAt sight of Abra's long white beard, his wizard's wand, and cloak\ncovered with cabalistic signs, even Ursula's courage had begun to ebb.\nShe had hastily retreated from the steps and followed Margaret once more\nwithin the protecting shelter of the shadows.\n\n\"I want to know my fortune, Margaret mine,\" she said in a voice which\nwas not quite as firm as before, \"and I hear that this witch can see\ninto the future. 'Tis said that she has marvellous powers.\"\n\n\"Why should you want to know the future?\" persisted timid, practical\nMargaret; \"is not the present good enough for you?\"\n\n\"His Grace of Wessex comes back to Court to-day,\" rejoined Ursula,\n\"after an absence of many months.\"\n\n\"Well?--what of him?\"\n\n\"What of him? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Margaret, art stupid, or art not my friend? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nIs it not natural that I should wish to know whether I am to be Duchess\nof Wessex or abbess in a holy but uncomfortable convent?\"\n\n\"Yes, 'tis natural enough,\" assented Margaret thoughtfully, \"but----\"\n\n\"His Grace has never seen me since I was so long,\" said Ursula with a\nshort, impatient sigh, and stretching out a round arm decked with a\nsleeve of rich silk and fine lace. \"I had a red face then, and pap was\nstuffed into my mouth to keep me quiet. You see, I could not have been\nmadly alluring then.\"\n\n\"And you are beautiful now, Ursula. But of what avail is it? You cannot\nwed His Grace of Wessex, for he'll never ask you to be his wife. He'll\nmarry the Queen. All England wishes it.\"\n\n\"But I wish him to marry me,\" quoth Ursula with a resolute tap of her\nhigh-heeled shoe against the ground. \"Yes, me! and I want that witch\nyonder to ask the stars if he will fall in love with me when he sees me,\nor if he will yield to those who want to make of him a tool for their\npolitical ambition, and marry an ugly, ill-tempered old woman who\nhappens to be Queen of England.\"\n\n\"Ursula!\"\n\nMargaret's horror, amazement, and awe had rendered her almost\nspeechless. Ursula's utterance was nearly sacrilegious, in these days\nwhen kings and queens ruled by right divine.\n\nBut the young girl continued, quite unabashed by her friend's rebuke.\n\n\"Well,\" she said imperturbably, \"you can't deny that the Queen is old!\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and ugly! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and ill-tempered! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nMargaret, however, was prepared to deny these monstrous statements with\nthe last breath left in her delicate body. The poor little soul was\nfrightened out of her wits.\n\nSuppose some one had overheard!--and repeated the tale that two of the\nQueen's ladies-in-waiting had called Her Majesty old!--and ugly!--and\nill-tempered!----\n\nNay, Ursula's madcap freaks were past bearing! and would lead her into\nserious trouble one of these days.\n\n\"Margaret,\" whispered the delinquent, who still seemed quite unaware of\nthe enormity of her offence, \"hast thou ever seen His Grace of Wessex?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Margaret curtly, for she was still very wrathful, and\nvaguely felt that, at this stage, all references to the Duke were\nsomehow treasonable.\n\n\"Nor I since I was a baby,\" sighed Ursula; \"but see here. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nFrom beneath the folds of her cloak she drew a chain and locket, and\nholding the latter before Margaret's unwilling eyes, she said\necstatically--\n\n\"That's his picture. Isn't he handsome?\"\n\n\"You've fallen in love with his picture!\"\n\n\"Madly!\"\n\n\"Madly indeed!\" retorted Margaret.\n\nUrsula once more hid the locket inside her robe. She had regained all\nher courage. Once more dragging her weaker companion by the wrist she\nturned towards the witch's booth.\n\nAbra, the magician, tired out by his day's exertions, had settled\nhimself down on a tattered piece of rug outside the tent; there he had\nfallen peacefully asleep, his venerable head thrown back, his lean\nshanks hanging over the edge of the platform and snoring the snore of\nthe just. Thus he had failed to spy the two hooded, dainty figures, who\nhad all along kept within the shadows.\n\nSuddenly through his pleasant slumbers he heard an eagerly whispered--\n\n\"Hey! friend!\"\n\nWhilst the toe of his shoe was violently tagged at from below.\n\n\"Friend, wake!\"\n\n\"They won't listen!\" added an impatient, half-tearful voice.\n\nBut already Abra was on his feet. Giving his humble henchman a violent\nkick to wake him up, he began to mutter mechanically, even before he was\nfully conscious--\n\n\"What ho, my masters! consult the world-famous necromancer----\"\n\nBang! bang! bang! on the big drum came automatically from his henchman,\nwho was only half awake.\n\n\"No! no! no!\" entreated Ursula, \"I prithee not so much noise! We wish to\nconsult the soothsayer .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. we've brought some money .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. three gold\npieces .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. is that enough? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. But in the name of Our Lady I beg of\nthee not to make so much noise.\"\n\nTimidly she held up a silken purse towards the astonished wizard. Three\ngold pieces!--why, 'twas a fortune, the like of which the worthy Abra\nhad never beheld in one sum in his life.\n\nTo ask him not to make a noise was to demand the impossible. With one\nhand he pushed his henchman vigorously to one side. The latter dropped\nhis cymbals, which rattled off the platform with an ear-splitting crash.\n\nAll the while Abra in stentorian tones, and holding back the folds of\nthe tent, was shouting at the top of his voice--\n\n\"This way, ladies! for the great soothsayer Mirrab, the sale of\nlove-philters and charms, and of the true elixir of life.\"\n\n\"The die is cast, Margaret mine,\" said Ursula, trying vainly to steady\nher voice, which was trembling, and her knees which were shaking beneath\nher. \"Art coming?--Oh! I--I--feel a little nervous,\" she admitted in\nspite of herself, \"and you--oh! how your hand trembles. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nShe was frankly terrified now. The noise was so awful, and though she\ndid not dare look to the right or left of her she was conscious that she\nand her friend were no longer alone on the open place. She could hear\nthe murmur of voices, the sound of idle folk gathering in every\ndirection.\n\nHer instinct suggested immediate flight, and the abandonment of this mad\nadventure while there was yet time, but her pride urged her to proceed.\nShe gripped Margaret's wrist with a resolute hand and made a quick rush\nfor the steps.\n\nAlas! she was just two seconds too late. The next instant she felt her\nwaist seized firmly from behind, whilst a merry voice shouted--\n\n\"Cornered at last!\"\n\nWrenching herself free with a sudden twist of her firm young shoulders,\nUrsula contrived to liberate herself momentarily. She was dimly\nconscious of having caught sight of Margaret in the like plight as\nherself.\n\n\"Not so fast, fair one,\" whispered an insinuating voice close to her, \"a\nword in thy pretty ear.\"\n\nOh! the shame of this vulgar adventure! Pursued like some kitchen wench\nout on a spree, by a gallant, eager for an idle kiss.\n\nShe felt her cheeks tingle underneath her mask; saw and guessed the\nshort laugh, the shrug of the shoulders of the idlers round, far too\naccustomed to these spectacles to take more than passing note of it.\n\nOnce more the firm grip had seized her waist. This time she felt herself\npowerless to struggle.\n\n\"Nay, in the name of heaven, sir,\" she entreated tearfully, \"I pray you\nlet me go.\"\n\n\"Not until I have caught a nearer sight of those bright eyes, that shine\nat me through that cruel mask.\"\n\nThe soft guttural tones revealed the identity of the speaker to Ursula.\nShe knew Don Miguel well; knew his wild, impudent spirit, his love of\nidle flirtations which had already made him the terror of the prim\nQueen's Court. She knew that she would not be allowed to escape before\nthis ridiculous episode had been brought to its usual conclusion.\n\nOh! how she longed for the Duchess of Lincoln's severe guardianship at\nthis moment! How bitterly she repented the folly which had prompted her\nto drag Margaret along into this wild adventure.\n\nPoor Margaret! she, too, was doing her best to evade the unwelcome\nattentions of her gallant! and that magician! and those louts! all\ngrinning like so many apes at the spectacle.\n\nIt was maddening!\n\nAnd she was helpless!\n\nThe next moment the young Spaniard's indiscreet hands had snatched the\nprotecting mask from her face, and the daintiest and most perfect\npicture Nature had ever fashioned stood revealed, blushing with shame\nand vexation, before his delighted, slightly sarcastic gaze.\n\n\"Ah! luck favours me indeed!\" he murmured with avowed admiration, \"the\nnewly-risen star--nay! the brightest sun in the firmament of beauty! the\nLady Ursula Glynde!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE LADY URSULA\n\n\nShe was only nineteen then. Not very tall, yet perfectly proportioned,\nand with that small, oval face of hers which delighted yet puzzled all\nthe artists of the epoch.\n\nThe dark hood of her cloak had fallen back at the impertinent gesture of\nthe young Spaniard; her fair hair, slightly touched with warm gold,\nescaped in a few unruly curls from beneath the stiff coif of brocade\nwhich encircled her pretty head.\n\nThe neck was long; the shoulders, rich, young and firm, gleamed like\nivory beneath the primly folded kerchief of lace of a dead, bluish\nwhite, a striking note of harmonious contrast.\n\nHave not all the rhymesters of the period sung the praises of her eyes?\nWhat shall the poor chronicler add to these poetical effusions, save\nthat Ursula's eyes were as changeable in colour as were her moods, her\nspirits, the expression of her face, and the inflexions of her voice.\n\nAnd then there was the proud little toss of the head, that contemptuous\ncurl of the lip which rendered her more desirable than any of her more\nyielding companions.\n\nIndeed, Don Miguel felt in luck. His arm was still round her waist. He\nfelt the young figure stiffen beneath his admiring glances.\n\nThe fair one was half mad with rage, and quite adorable in her wrath.\n\n\"My lord Marquis, this is an outrage!\" she said at last, \"and here in\nEngland----\"\n\n\"Nay, fair one,\" rejoined the Spaniard with a slight accent of irony,\n\"even in England, when two ladies, masked and alone, are held prisoners\nat nightfall, and in a public place, by their ardent adorers, they must\nneeds pay ransom for their release. What say you, my lord?\" he added,\nturning gaily to where his friend held pretty Margaret a not too\nunwilling prisoner.\n\n\"'Tis but justice,\" assented Lord Everingham, \"and yours the first\nprize, Marquis. Fair one,\" he said, looking down into Margaret's shyly\nterrified eyes, \"wilt pay toll to me the while?\"\n\n\"Gentlemen!\" proudly protested Lady Ursula, \"an there's any honour in\nyou----\"\n\n\"Nay! honour lies in snatching a kiss from those sweet lips,\" rejoined\nDon Miguel with a graceful flourish of his plumed hat.\n\nThis act of gallantry, however, almost cost him the price of his\nvictory. Ursula Glynde, born and bred in the country, was the daughter\nof a sturdy Cornish nobleman. Accustomed to ride untamed foals, to have\nbouts at the broadsword or the poniard with the best man in the county,\nshe would not yield a kiss or own herself vanquished quite as readily as\nthe Spaniard seemed to expect.\n\nWith a vigorous jerk of the body she had once more freed herself from\nthe Marquis's grasp, and running up to Margaret, she snatched her by the\nhand and dragged her away from Lord Everingham, readjusting her hood and\nmask as she flew towards the booth, vaguely hoping for shelter behind\nthe folds of the tent.\n\nBut once more fate interposed relentlessly betwixt her and her attempts\nat escape. Two gallants, seeing the episode, eager to have a hand in the\nadventure, friends no doubt too of Don Miguel and Everingham, laughingly\nbarred the way to the steps, just as the two girls had contrived to\nreach them. With a cry of disappointment Ursula, still dragging Margaret\nafter her, tried to double back. But it was too late. Don Miguel and\nLord Everingham were waiting for them on the other side. They were two\nto one now, and all chances of escape had hopelessly vanished.\n\nNever had Ursula Glynde felt so mortified in her life.\n\n\"Many thanks, gentlemen, for this timely interference,\" came in mocking\naccents from that odious Spaniard. \"The ransom, sweet one,\" he added, as\nthe chase 'twixt gallants and maids became more general, and the girls\nat last felt themselves quite helpless and surrounded.\n\nUrsula's pride alone prevented her from bursting into tears.\n\n\"By my faith! here is strange sport!\" said a pleasant, slightly mocking\nvoice suddenly. \"What say you, Harry Plantagenet? A lively sight .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nwhat? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. four gallants frightening two ladies!\"\n\nInstinctively every one had turned in the direction whence the voice had\ncome. A man was standing some dozen yards away with mantle tightly drawn\nround him, his tall figure stooping to pat and fondle a powerful-looking\nboarhound, which clung closely to his side.\n\nHe had spoken very quietly, apparently to the dog, whose great ears he\nwas gently stroking.\n\nWithout taking any further heed of the somewhat discomfited gentlemen,\nhe came forward towards the little group.\n\n\"Ladies, your way stands clear,\" he said, with that same pleasant irony\nstill apparent in his voice, and without casting more than a cursory\nglance at the close hoods and dark masks, which was all that he could\nsee of the ladies, whom he had so incontinently saved from an unpleasant\nposition.\n\n\"Sir,\" murmured Ursula, under her breath and without attempting to\nmove, for she felt as if her knees would give way under her.\n\n\"Nay, Madam,\" rejoined the newcomer lightly, \"if my interference has\nangered you, I pray you forgive me and I'll withdraw, as these gentlemen\nhere obviously desire me to do. But an you really wish to escape, my\nfriend here will assure you that you can do so unmolested. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Eh,\nHarry? what say you?\" he added, once more turning his attention to the\ndog.\n\nThe boarhound, as if conscious of this appeal to his chivalry, turned a\nknowing eye on the two girls.\n\nThe four men had been taken so absolutely unawares that during the few\nseconds while this brief colloquy took place they had scarcely realised\nthat an interfering and unknown stranger was trying to hamper them in\ntheir amusements.\n\nThey had remained quite speechless, more astonished at the newcomer's\nimpertinence than wrathful at the interruption; and when the next\ninstant Ursula and Margaret suddenly fled with unaffected precipitancy,\nno one attempted to stop them.\n\nHarry Plantagenet's intelligent eyes followed the retreating figures\nuntil they were out of sight. Then he yawned with obtrusive incivility,\nand plainly showed his master that the present company no longer\ninterested him.\n\n\"Well, Harry, old man, shall we go?\" said the stranger, calmly turning\non his heel.\n\nBut at this final piece of cool insolence Don Miguel de Suarez at last\nrecovered from his astonishment. This tame ending to an unwarrantable\nintrusion was certainly not to his liking, and he, for one, was\nunaccustomed to see his whims or caprices thwarted.\n\nIn these days tempers ran high, hot blood was allowed free rein, and at\na word or a smile out of place, swords and poniards were soon out of\ntheir sheaths and friendships of yesterday changed to deadly antagonism\nin the space of a few minutes.\n\n\"Carramba!\" swore the young Spaniard, \"this passes belief. What say you,\ngentlemen?\"\n\nAnd, drawing his long, tapering sword, he barred the way threateningly\nto the stranger.\n\nThe silence, thus broken, seemed to restore at once to the other three\ngallants the full measure of their wrath. One and all following Don\nMiguel's example, had put their hands to their sword-hilts.\n\n\"Aye! unmask, stranger,\" said Lord Everingham peremptorily.\n\n\"Unmask! unmask!\" came in threatening accents from all.\n\n\"Unmask, or .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Or by our Lady!\" rejoined the stranger lightly, \"you'll all run your\nblades into my silken doublet and thus end pleasantly a chivalrous\nescapade. Eh?\"\n\nOne could divine the pleasant, ironical smile lurking behind the thick\ncurtain of the mask. The Spaniard's blood was boiling with vexation.\nHarry Plantagenet gave an impatient whine.\n\n\"Your name, stranger, first,\" commanded Don Miguel haughtily, \"then your\nsword if you are not a coward; after that I and these gentlemen will\ndeal with your impudence if you have any left.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence; the stranger whistled to his dog.\n\n\"My sword is at your command,\" he said; \"mine impudence you shall deal\nwith as you list. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. My name is Wessex!\" he added with a sudden\nhauteur which seemed to tower above Don Miguel as the gigantic oak of\nthe glen towers above the bustling willow beneath.\n\nAnd he removed the mask from his face.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nHIS GRACE OF WESSEX\n\n\nThere are several portraits extant of Robert d'Esclade, fifth Duke of\nWessex, notably the one by Antonio Moro in the Pitti Gallery at\nFlorence.\n\nBut in the somewhat stiff portraiture of that epoch it is perhaps a\nlittle difficult to trace the real image, the inner individuality of one\nof the most interesting personalities at the Court of Mary Tudor.\n\nThere is, however, a miniature of him, attributed to Holbein, and\ncertainly drawn by the hand of a great master, which renders with\ngreater truth and loving accuracy the peculiar charm made up of\nhalf-indolent nonchalance, gracious condescension, and haughty reserve\nwhich characterized the Duke of Wessex.\n\nSo justly styled His Grace!\n\nThe reserve was so little apparent. The hauteur only came to the surface\nin response to unwelcome familiarity. But the debonair indolence was\nalways there, the lazy droop of the lids, the nonchalant shrug of the\nshoulders, when grave matters were discussed, and also that obvious\nfastidiousness--a love of everything that was beautiful, from a fine\nhorse, down to a piece of delicate lace--which annoyed the more\nsedate-minded courtiers of the Queen.\n\nAnd with it all that wonderful virility and vigour, that joy of life and\ndelight in gaiety and laughter which lent to the grave face at times a\nspark of almost boyish exuberance; that mad, merry, proud insouciance,\nwhich throughout his life made him meet every danger--aye! every sorrow\nand disgrace--with the same bright smile on his lips.\n\nScheyfne, in his letters to the emperor, Charles V, says of the Duke of\nWessex that he was insufferably conceited--\"il est tres orgueilleux de\nsa beaut\u00c3\u00a9 personelle, laquelle certes est plus que m\u00c3\u00a9diocre.\"\n\nNoailles, too, speaks of him as \"moult fatueux et vaniteux de sa\npersonne.\"\n\nBut it was hardly likely that these foreign delegates, each bent upon\ntheir own schemes, would look with favour upon His Grace. His only merit\nin their eyes was that same characteristic indolence of his, which\ncaused a man of his great wealth and boundless influence to abstain from\npolitics.\n\nCertes no one could accuse him of intriguing for his own political\nadvancement. Mary Tudor's own avowed penchant for him was so well known,\nthat he had but to say the word and the crown of England would be his,\nto share with the Queen.\n\nYet since the death of Edward VI he had not been seen at Court. Small\nwonder, therefore, that at sight of the Duke all four men seemed amazed.\n\n\"His Grace of Wessex!\" they ejaculated in one breath.\n\nBut already Lord Everingham had put up his sword and gone to Wessex with\nhands outstretched.\n\n\"Wessex!\" he said with unmistakable delight. \"By Our Lady, this is a\njoyful surprise!\"\n\nThe other two Englishmen also shook the Duke warmly by the hand.\n\n\"I did not know you were in England, my lord,\" said the one.\n\n\"Right glad are we to welcome you back,\" added the other.\n\n\"Well, Harry, my friend,\" quoth the Duke gaily, \"methinks you and I are\nnot to be spiked after all.\"\n\nHarry Plantagenet, however, was looking doubtfully at the young\nSpaniard, who had remained somewhat in the background, regarding the\nfirst effusions of his friends with a certain ill-concealed impatience.\nWith almost human intelligence the dog seemed to understand that here\nwas a person who was inimical to his master, and in his faithful eyes\nthere came that unmistakable furtive look and blink, with which dogs\ninvariably show their mistrust and dislike.\n\nBut Don Miguel de Suarez was above all a diplomatist. Capricious and\nfond of adventure, not over-scrupulous as to the choice of his\npleasures, yet he never allowed his dearest whim to interfere with\npolitical necessities.\n\nA few seconds' quick reflection soon made it clear to him that a quarrel\nwith the Duke of Wessex would, at this juncture, greatly endanger his\nown popularity at the English Court, and thereby minimize his chances of\ncarrying through the negotiations entrusted to him by King Philip of\nSpain.\n\nUnder the leadership of His Eminence the Cardinal de Moreno he certainly\nhoped to bring about the marriage of Philip with the Queen of England.\n\nHe knew perfectly well that he and his eminent colleague were opposed in\nthis design by the entire ultra-English faction here, and also that this\nfaction was composed of practically the whole of the nobility and\nchivalry of the realm.\n\nThe Duke of Wessex was the pride and hope of this party, for Courtenay,\nweak and effeminate, had lost all his partisans. What more natural than\nthat the most distinguished, most brilliant of Queen Mary's subjects\nshould share her throne with her?\n\nAll this and more passed swiftly through Don Miguel's active brain.\nTherefore, as soon as there was a lull in the joyful welcome accorded\nto the Duke by his friends, he too stepped forward, having with vigorous\nself-will curbed his unruly temper and forced his full, sensuous lips to\na smile. He had realized the expediency of, at any rate, outward\namiability.\n\n\"A great name, my lord,\" he said, bowing with grave ceremony to Wessex,\n\"and one familiar to me already, though I have not yet been honoured by\nseeing you at Court.\"\n\nThe Duke eyed him for the space of two brief seconds, whilst just the\nfaintest touch of superciliousness seemed to be lurking somewhere at the\nback of his neck. But he returned the Spaniard's bow with equal\nceremony. Then he placed his hand on the head of his dog.\n\n\"Nay, sir,\" he said, \"my friend here bears a prouder name than mine.\nHarry Plantagenet, make your bow to the envoy of His Most Catholic\nMajesty. I call him Plantagenet, sir, after our King Harry V, who drove\nback the French at Agincourt. Nay, your pardon; this scarce interests\nyou. You were not born then, and Spain was not yet a kingdom.\"\n\nHe spoke lightly, and none but Everingham's devoted ears caught the\nslight tone of impertinence which underlay the bland, seemingly empty\nspeech.\n\nDon Miguel himself was determined to keep urbane.\n\n\"A beautiful creature, indeed,\" he said suavely; \"but you, milor Duke,\ndo you return to Hampton Court with us this night?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" replied Wessex, \"among so many brilliant diplomatists from Spain\nthere's scarce room for a mere idler like myself.\"\n\n\"Yet we diplomatists are hoping to pit our poor wits against Your\nGrace's,\" added Don Miguel pointedly.\n\n\"Against those of my friends perhaps, my lord,\" rejoined the Duke drily.\n\"Mine own are incorrigibly idle.\"\n\nDon Miguel, as was his wont, did not pursue the subject any further. He\nwas trying to read the refined, distinctly haughty countenance, which\nwas smiling down at him so pleasantly just now, and taking mental stock\nof this antagonist, whom rumour had described to him and to his chief as\nthe only serious obstacle to the proposed Spanish alliance.\n\nHe saw before him a man in the full pride of youth and manhood, tall and\nwell knit, and wearing with easy grace the elaborate slashes and puffs,\ntrunks and silk hose, which present fashion had decreed.\n\nThe Spaniard's keen and critical eye took in every detail of this\ninteresting personality: the short, light brown hair worn close to the\nhead, the fair moustache and delicately refined hands, the richness of\nthe doublet, the priceless value of the lace at throat and wrist.\n\n\"A fop and an idler!\" he murmured mentally.\n\nThen he thought of the Queen of England. No longer young, with but\nlittle taste in ornament and dress, and certes quite unversed in all\nthose wiles, which might have drawn this brilliant butterfly into her\nnet.\n\nThe Spaniard longed to see these two together. The presence of this\nformidable adversary gave additional zest to the game he was playing on\nthe political chess-board.\n\nAn unwilling courtier! A love-sick Queen! Carramba! it was interesting.\n\n\"When do you return to the Palace, my lord?\" Everingham was asking of\nthe Duke.\n\n\"To-night,\" replied the latter, \"by our gracious Liege Lady's own\ncommand.\"\n\n\"To-night then?\"\n\n\"Without fail. Harry Plantagenet and I will present our humble respects\nto Her Majesty.\"\n\n\"'Tis au revoir then, Your Grace,\" quoth Don Miguel. \"We meet again\nto-night.\"\n\n\"At your service, my lord Marquis.\"\n\nStill smiling amicably the Spaniard took his leave, soon followed by two\nof his companions. Lord Everingham too was about to depart, but he felt\nWessex' detaining hand on his arm.\n\n\"That unpleasant-looking Spaniard? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" queried the Duke.\n\n\"Don Miguel, Marquis de Suarez,\" replied Everingham, \"envoy of His\nMajesty, the King of Spain.\"\n\n\"Aye, I knew all that. I was merely reflecting that if he happen to be a\nspecimen of our Liege Lady's Court, meseems I were a fool to go back to\nit.\"\n\n\"Come back to it with me now,\" urged his friend earnestly.\n\n\"Not till to-night. Do not grudge me these few last hours of freedom. By\nOur Lady! I meant to consult the famous witch, like a sober burgher out\non a holiday. But in the name of all the saints in the calendar let us\nforget there are such things as Spaniards at the English Court just\nnow.\"\n\nHe laughed, a half weary, wholly pleasant laugh, as, followed by his\ndog, he led his friend in the opposite direction to that in which Don\nMiguel had rapidly walked away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nSILKEN BONDS\n\n\nWessex and Everingham had readjusted their masks and wrapped their\ncloaks around them, ere they once more mingled with the crowd which\nstill thronged around the gaily decked booths.\n\nThe evening now was rapidly drawing in. Hampton Court, in the\nfast-gathering haze beyond, looked grey and ghostlike, with brightly\nillumined windows beginning to gleam here and there.\n\nWith an impatient frown, Wessex deliberately turned his back on the\ngorgeous pile: it represented boredom to him, politics and dullness, and\nhe loved gaiety, sunshine, and laughter, these merry-makers here, the\npretty country wenches with their bare arms and neat ankles showing\nbeneath their brightly coloured robes.\n\nEveringham was silent as he followed his friend through the crowd. But\nWessex' laugh was always infectious, and he seemed in a merry mood\nto-night. Harry Plantagenet alone seemed morose; he disapproved of all\nthese country louts, who were over free with their caresses. He kept\nclose to his master's heel, and only gave an occasional growl, when some\nimpudent 'prentice dared to come too nigh.\n\n\"Well, Harry, old friend,\" said the Duke after a while, \"shall we go and\nconsult the witch, or wait until the stars are out? Friend Everingham\nhere is none too good company to-night, eh? In thine ear, proud\nPlantagenet, he hath designs on our freedom. But the soothsayer shall\ncast our horoscope, and look into our future, see if you are to become\nchief lapdog to the Queen of England, or if we are both of us to fall in\nbondage to the mistress plighted to us by an uncomfortable old\ngentleman, who had not consulted us in the matter. 'Sdeath man,\" he\nadded, suddenly looking straight into Everingham's serious face, \"why do\nyou look so grave? Tell me, pending that witch's starlit lies, what's\nyour best news?\"\n\n\"By my faith!\" responded Everingham simply, \"the best news is Your\nGrace's return. 'Twas an ill wind that wafted you away from Court.\"\n\n\"Aye! 'twas the wind of infinite boredom wafted my Grace away,\" replied\nthe Duke with a smile. \"Confess, friend, that the Court cannot be\nalluring with the Queen telling her beads, the foreign ambassadors\nruling England, the Privy Council at loggerheads, the people grumbling,\nand the ladies yawning. Brrr!\"\n\nHe gave a mock shiver, and seemed not to notice the quick look of\nreproach cast at him by his friend.\n\n\"And out of sheer boredom,\" quoth Everingham with a sigh of deep\ndisappointment, \"you piqued the Queen of England.\"\n\nWessex did not reply at once. At Everingham's tone of rebuke a slight\nfrown had contracted his forehead, and that certain look of hauteur,\nnever wholly absent from his face, at once became more apparent.\n\nThere was more than mere camaraderie between these two men: unity of\nthought, similarity of tastes and education, a great and overwhelming\nlove for their own country, together with mutual understanding and\nappreciation, had long ago knit the ties of friendship closely between\nthem. It was generally admitted by every one that Lord Everingham might\nventure on a ground of familiarity with His Grace which no one else\nquite dared to tread.\n\nThis time too, after that instant's hesitation, the reserve which every\nnow and then seemed entirely to detach the Duke of Wessex from his\nsurroundings, quickly disappeared again. The pleasant smile returned to\nthe proud lips, he shrugged his shoulders and said simply--\n\n\"Is the Queen of England piqued?\"\n\n\"Can you ask?\" rejoined the other with increased vehemence.\n\nThen he checked himself abruptly, feeling no doubt how useless it was to\ndiscuss such matters seriously just now.\n\n\"The only woman,\" he added, falling in once more with his friend's\nlighter mood, \"the only woman whose blandishments His Grace of Wessex\nhas ever been known to resist.\"\n\n\"And that with difficulty,\" concluded the Duke gaily. \"But you see,\nfriend,\" he added with mock gravity, \"with a Tudor you never can tell;\nyou might lose your heart one day and your head the next.\"\n\n\"Mary Tudor loves you too well .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" protested Lord Everingham.\n\n\"She is the daughter of King Harry VIII, remember, and would threaten me\nwith the block or the rack at every indiscretion.\"\n\nHe paused, then added quaintly--\n\n\"And I would commit so many.\"\n\n\"A woman who loves always forgives,\" urged his friend.\n\n\"A woman, my good Everingham, will forgive a grave infidelity--perhaps!\nbut not a number of little indiscretions. Mine,\" he added with a light\nsigh, \"would be the little indiscretions.\"\n\n\"And while you fled from Court the Queen of England has almost promised\nto wed the Spanish king,\" said Everingham bitterly.\n\nHe watched his friend keenly as he spoke and paused a moment before he\nadded pointedly--\n\n\"'Twill be a proud day for the peers of England when they bow the knee\nto their Liege Lord, a foreign king.\"\n\nWessex shrugged his broad shoulders and turned to where a pretty wench,\ndispensing ale to a scarlet-cloaked burgher, formed a picture pleasing\nto his artistic eye.\n\nEveringham, somewhat proud of his own diplomatic skill, had noted,\nhowever, a certain stiffening of His Grace's figure at the vision which\nhad been conjured before him.\n\nThat of a Wessex bending the knee before a Spaniard.\n\n\"You were away,\" continued Everingham, eager to goad his friend into\nspeech, \"and my Lord Cardinal and Don Miguel know how to blow upon the\nflames of Mary's jealousy. Your influence can still save England, my\nlord,\" he added with great earnestness, \"let not your enemies say that\nfear of a woman keeps you from exerting it.\"\n\n\"H'm! do they say that?\" mused Wessex quaintly, whilst a smile, which\nalmost might be called boyish, altered the whole expression of his\nserious face. \"By my faith! but they are right. One's enemies usually\nare.\"\n\nHe drew his friend away from the immediate vicinity of a jabbering\ncrowd, into a dark corner formed by one of the booths. Everingham,\nthinking that at last he had led Wessex into a graver train of thought,\nfailed to notice the humorous twinkle of the eyes which had so palpably\nstruggled to the surface.\n\n\"It is the fear of a woman has kept me away from Court,\" he whispered\nsolemnly, \"but that woman is not the Queen of England.\"\n\n\"Who is it then?\"\n\n\"In your ear, friend .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. 'tis the Lady Ursula Glynde.\"\n\nEveringham could scarce suppress a movement of intense satisfaction.\nLady Ursula! beautiful, exquisite Lady Ursula was the one\nstumbling-block on which the schemes of his faction might become\nhopelessly shattered.\n\nWessex was nominally plighted to the lady. True, 'twas an engagement\nundertaken by the lady's own father, without the consent of the parties\nchiefly concerned. But in Tudor England there was a curious adherence to\nsuch solemnly plighted troths, which might have proved a bar to the\nDuke's sense of absolute freedom.\n\nIf, however, he looked upon this unnatural and monstrous pledge with the\nlightness which it fully deserved, if he considered himself at liberty\nto break the imaginary bonds which held him to Lady Ursula, then the\nwork of his partisans would become comparatively easy.\n\nThey had always hoped and fully intended to overcome His Grace's\nscruples in the matter, and fondly thought that they would succeed. But\nsince the Duke himself looked indifferently upon this so-called troth,\nwhy, Everingham himself was the first to feel the keenest satisfaction\nat the thought.\n\n\"You dislike the lady then?\" he asked with unfeigned delight.\n\n\"I have never seen her,\" retorted Wessex placidly. \"At any rate, not\nsince she was in her cradle. I certainly didn't like her then.\"\n\n\"She is very beautiful,\" remarked Everingham, with a somewhat shamefaced\nrecollection of his previous adventure, \"but----\"\n\n\"She might be a veritable angel, yet she would frighten me.\"\n\nA mock shudder passed through his tall, athletic frame, and taking his\nfriend's arm in his, he whispered confidentially, \"Think of it, my lord!\nA woman whom duty _compels_ one to love--Brrr!--Her own father plighted\nour troth; I am left comparatively free, yet if I do not wed Lady\nUrsula, she is doomed to end her days in a convent. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. A matter of\nhonour--what? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Yet I--I, who could love any woman,\" he added\nemphatically, \"be she queen or peasant--that is--h'm!--if I were really\nput to it--find the very thought of my promised bride abhorrent. She is\nthe one woman in all the world whom I could never love--never! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I\nknow it! So I ran away from Court, not because I feared one woman loved\nme too much, but because I knew I should love one woman too little.\"\n\nHe had spoken so light-heartedly, so gaily, that in spite of the grave\nissues at stake Everingham could not help but laugh.\n\n\"Nay! perhaps you exaggerate the danger,\" he said. \"The Lady Ursula\nmight prefer the convent to being a duchess. She has never seen Your\nGrace, she is rich and high-born, she may be pious----\"\n\n\"Or perverse,\" responded Wessex. \"I've never met a woman yet who didn't\nwant--badly--the thing she mightn't get.\"\n\n\"Is England then a woman,\" queried Everingham with renewed earnestness,\n\"since she wants Wessex?\"\n\nBut the Duke was not prepared to follow his friend to-night into\nsentimental, ultra-patriotic bypaths. He was not altogether inclined to\nsacrifice his liberty for the sake of ousting the Spanish king from his\nproposed English throne.\n\nNevertheless he rejoined more gravely than was his wont.\n\n\"Does England really want me?\" he said with gentle irony. \"Nay!\" he\nadded, restraining with one hand Everingham's exuberant protests, \"I\nknow! I know! you all think so, and that I am an unhallowed idler,\nletting my country drift into the arms of the foreigner. Do not deny it,\nfriend. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Perhaps I am. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Nay! we'll say, indeed I am. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nThere! there! calm your fears. Have I not told you that Her Majesty hath\ncommanded my presence at Court? We'll set our poor wits to oust Spanish\ndiplomacy, and I must trust my luckiest star to inspire in the Lady\nUrsula a wholesome desire for the convent; for I tell thee, friend, that\nif she holds me to my silken bonds, I will at once repair to the\noutermost corner of the earth and thence drop into vacancy, or take\nflight to the blue dome of heaven above.\"\n\n\"God protect Your Grace,\" rejoined Everingham with grave solemnity. \"Ah!\nI fear no Spanish influence now,\" he added enthusiastically. \"You'll\nsave England, my lord, and the gratitude of the nation will be at your\nfeet.\"\n\nWessex smiled, shrugged his shoulders, and without further allusion to\nmore serious subjects the two men mingled once more among the crowd.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE VEILED WITCH\n\n\nOutside the witch's tent all was silent and deserted. Darkness had\ngradually crept in, and with it--as far as the rest of the Fair was\nconcerned--additional noise and exuberant gaiety.\n\nHuge torches of gum and resin flickered at the entrance of every booth,\nthrowing quaint red lights, and deep, mysterious shadows all round,\ndistorting the faces of the gaping multitude, and of the criers, until\nthey looked like fantastic figures, wizards all from some neighbouring\nBrocken.\n\nWhether the world-famous necromancer, Mirrab, and her attendant genii\nwere lacking in business or no, no one could say, for there was no torch\noutside their tent, and Abra had ceased to lure the passer-by. The open\nplace in front of the platform was dark and still.\n\nSuddenly from out the shadows something seemed to move forward, whilst a\nmysterious \"Hist! hist!\" came echoing from more than one direction.\n\nGradually the sound became more distinct, dark figures emerged from\nevery side, and presently a compact group of moving, whispering people\ncongregated some few yards away from the booth. Then a voice, still low\nand muffled, but firm and emphatic, detached itself from the ghostlike\nmurmur around.\n\n\"My masters, I call upon you to witness! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. The Scriptures say, 'Let\nno witch live.' .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Shall we disobey the Scriptures and allow that\nwitch to live? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. She is possessed, and the devil dwells in that\nbooth.\"\n\nGroans and threatening curses greeted this peroration. The speaker\nraised his voice somewhat.\n\n\"Will you allow Satan to remain amongst you?\"\n\n\"No! no! no!\" came in excited accents from the little crowd.\n\n\"And I say death to the witch!\" added the leading voice solemnly.\n\n\"Death to the witch!\" came in weird echoes from all around.\n\nThen there was silence. The dark heads bent closer together.\n\n\"What wilt thou do, Matthew?\" whispered one voice with awed timidity.\n\n\"Let her burn, I say,\" replied the learned village oracle; \"'tis the\nonly way of getting rid of Satan.\"\n\nIt had been a hot day. The heads of this pack of country folk had been\noverheated with sack and spiced ale; an unreasoning, maniacal terror,\nwith superstition for its basis, had completed the work of completely\naddling their loutish brains. All day there had been talk of this veiled\nwitch, these strange spirits and weird monsters which she was reputed to\nconjure up at will. Thoughts of poisoned wells, of sweating sickness, of\nhell-fire raged through these poor misguided fellows' minds.\n\nWhat did they know of charlatanism or trickery? To them it was all real,\nliving, awesome, terrible. The devil was a person with glowing eyes, two\nhorns, and a forked tail, who caused innocent people to fall flat on\ntheir backs and foam at the mouth.\n\nEvery malady then unknown to science was ascribed to hellish agency. And\nhere, within a few yards, was an unearthly creature who actually\nconsorted with the creator of all evil, who wilfully brought him up from\nhis burning abode below the earth, and let him loose upon this peaceful\nvillage and its God-fearing inhabitants.\n\n\"Nay! burn her! burn her!\" they shouted, brandishing their sticks,\nemboldened through their very cowardice into deeds they would otherwise\nnever have contemplated without a shudder.\n\nAnd they shouted in order to keep up their exaltation and their\nexcitement; the devil is known to favour whisperings.\n\n\"After me, my masters,\" continued Matthew, who was still the leader of\nthis insane band of mischievous fools, \"after me. Remember there's\nsalvation for our sins if we burn the witch.\"\n\nWith another wild shout the little crowd made a rush for the platform of\nthe booth, just as Abra and his henchman, attracted by the strangeness\nof the noise, came out of the tent to see what might be amiss.\n\nBefore they had time to utter a sound of protest the two men were seized\nby the crowd and dragged down the steps with violence. The people had no\ntime to trouble about a lout such as he. They wanted the witch herself,\nnow, at once, while their blood was up and boiling; and the guard might\ncome round at any moment and frustrate them in their will.\n\n\"Out of the way, lout! out of the way! or thou'lt burn alongside of thy\ndamned witch!\"\n\nAbra had fallen on his knees, understanding only too well the danger\nwhich was threatening him. He had known all along what terrible risks he\nwas taking. 'Twas not well in these days to tamper with the\nsupernatural. But he had trusted to the good temper of holiday-makers,\nwhilst the certain patronage of rich burghers and Court gallants had\nproved an overwhelming temptation to his greed of gain. For the wench he\ncared but little. He had picked her out of the gutter one day, a\nstarving little slut, and had used her as a tool--a willing one\nenough--for his own pecuniary ends.\n\nEven now, with a cursing throng of maniacs round him, he only thought of\nhis own safety. Mean, abject, and cowardly, he fell upon his knees.\n\n\"Merciful heavens, my masters,\" he pleaded.\n\nBut the crowd was not in a humour to listen. The men kicked him on one\nside, and he fell up against his miserable companion, who was too\nterror-stricken to move.\n\nThen there was another rush up to the platform. Without thought or\npause, for these would have been fatal to the resolute purpose in view,\nand might give the devil time to look after his own.\n\nFrom within the tent there came now a frantic shriek of terror. The next\nmoment, the foremost among the crowd had pushed aside the gaudy\ndraperies, and that one shriek was answered by a dozen awesome,\nhorrified curses.\n\nThere was the witch at last. A poor trembling girl, scarce out of her\nteens, with beautiful, delicate features, and an abundance of golden\nhair falling round her shoulders; her mysterious veil--a bit of showy\ntinsel--lying in a heap on the floor. Nothing supernatural or devilish\nabout her, surely. Quaint, perhaps, because of that singular beauty of\nface and skin which seemed so ill-assorted with the sordidness of her\nsurroundings. One of Nature's curious freaks, this kitchen wench with a\nhead which would have graced a duchess, her interesting personality\nmerely the prey of a common charlatan, who used her for vulgar,\nsenseless trickery.\n\nFor the moment her beauty was distorted through the dawning of an awful\nterror. To a sane man she would only have seemed a wretched, miserable,\nfrightened woman. But not so to the ale-sodden, overheated minds of\nthese excited creatures, blinded by an almost maniacal fear.\n\nTo them she looked supernaturally tall, supernaturally weird, with great\nglowing eyes and tongues of flame illumining her person.\n\n\"The witch!\" they shouted, \"the witch! the witch!\"\n\n\"What do you want with me?\" murmured the poor girl.\n\nEgged on by their passions they smothered their terror. They seized her\nviolently by the wrists and dragged her out of her lair and on to the\nplatform, where the rest of the crowd were pressing.\n\nA shout of exultation, of hellish triumph, greeted the appearance of the\nwretched woman. Not a spark of pity was aroused by her helplessness, her\nobvious, abject terror.\n\n\"The witch! the witch! death to the witch!\"\n\nThey seemed to be fanning their own passions, adding fuel to the flames\nof their insensate wrath.\n\nThere was the source of all the evil which might have befallen the\npeaceful valley of the Thames! the creature with the evil eye, the\ndispenser of misery and death!\n\nThey had forgotten the guard now. Their lawlessness knew no bounds. But\nfor the incessant din of the merry-makers at the Fair, the banging of\nthe drums, and the shouts of the criers, their own yells of execration,\ntheir violent curses, and the shrieks of the captive girl could not have\nfailed to attract attention.\n\nBut every one was busy laughing and enjoying the last hours of this\nhappy day. No one came to interfere in this devilish work which was\nabout to be consummated.\n\nAnd every word the poor woman uttered but brought further vituperation\nupon her.\n\nShe shouted, \"Help!\"\n\n\"Hark, my masters,\" sneered Matthew loftily, \"she calls to Satan for\nhelp.\"\n\n\"What will you do with me?\" she pleaded. \"I've done you no wrong.\"\n\n\"Thou hast brought the devil in our midst.\"\n\n\"No! no!\"\n\n\"I saw thee riding on a broomstick--going to thy Sabbath revels.\"\n\n\"'Tis false!\"\n\n\"Tie her to the pole--quick!\"\n\nThe so-called witch, the friend of Satan and of all the powers of\ndarkness, fell upon her knees in an agony of the wildest despair.\nRealizing her position, the terrible doom which was awaiting her, her\nwhole figure seemed to writhe with the agony of her horror. She dragged\nherself to Matthew's knees--he seemed to be leading the others--she\nwrenched her arms free from those who held her and threw them round him.\nShe forced her voice to gentleness and pleading, tried to appeal to what\nwas a stone wall of unconquerable prejudice.\n\n\"Sirs, kind sirs,\" she entreated, \"you would not harm a poor girl who\nhad done you no wrong? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you won't harm me--you won't. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Oh,\nGod!\" she shrieked in her frenzy, \"you wouldn't--you wouldn't--Holy\nVirgin, protect me----\"\n\nA rough hand was placed over her mouth and her last yells were smothered\nas she was ruthlessly dragged away.\n\nThen with two or three leather belts she was securely tied to the\nflagstaff, whilst a thick woollen scarf was wound round her face and\nneck, leaving only the eyes free to roam wildly on the awful scene\naround.\n\nAwful indeed!\n\nMan turned to savage beast in the frenzy of his own fear.\n\nSwift and silent, like so many rodents in the night, the men began\ncollecting bits of wood, broke up their sticks into small pieces, tore\nbranches down from the old elm tree.\n\nMatthew the while, still the ringleader of this dastardly crew, was\ndirecting these gruesome operations.\n\n\"Hist!\" he admonished incessantly, \"not so much noise. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. We don't\nwant the guard to come this way, do we? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Now, John the smith,\nquick, where's thy resin? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. James the wheelwright, thy tinder,\nfriend. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Here! these faggots are not close enough. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Some more\non the left there!\"\n\nAnd the men, as alert as their clumsy bodies would allow, as quick as\nthe darkness would permit, groaning, sweating, falling up against one\nanother, worked with a will to accomplish the end which they had in\nview.\n\nTo burn the witch!\n\nAnd she, the woman, her poor wits almost gone at sight of this fast\napproaching, inevitable doom, did not attempt to struggle. Had the gag\nbeen removed from her mouth she would not have uttered a sound.\n\nNature, more merciful than her own children, had paralysed the brain of\nthe wretched girl and left her semi-imbecile, crazed, watching now with\nuncomprehending eyes the preparations for her own appalling death.\n\n\"Watch how the witch will burn!\" said Matthew in a hoarse whisper. \"Her\nsoul will fly out of her mouth, and it'll be shaped like a black cat.\"\n\nThey had all descended the steps and were standing in a semicircle on\nthe turf below, looking up at the miserable holocaust which they were\nabout to offer up to their own cowardly superstition.\n\nJames the wheelwright was busy with his tinder, with John the smith\nbending over him, ready with a resin torch, which would start the\nconflagration.\n\nAnd Mirrab, looking down on them with lack-lustre, idiotic eyes! Her\nbody had fallen in a strange, shapeless heap across the leather bonds\nwhich held her, her feet were buried in the pile of faggots, whilst her\nfingers worked convulsively behind the flagstaff to which they were\ntied.\n\nYe gods, what a spectacle!\n\nThe Duke of Wessex, having taken leave of his friend, had been idly\nstrolling towards the witch's booth, always closely followed by faithful\nHarry Plantagenet. At first sight of a group of men dimly outlined in\nthe darkness he scarcely realized what was happening.\n\nThe fitful flicker of the torch, as the resin became ignited, threw the\nmore distant figure of the woman into complete gloom.\n\nThen there was a sudden shout of triumph. The torch was blazing at last.\n\n\"The holy fire! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Burn the witch!\"\n\nJohn the smith, holding the torch aloft, inspired by the enthusiasm of\nhis friends, had turned towards the steps.\n\nFor the space of one second the red glow illumined that helpless bundle\nof gaudy tinsel only dimly suggesting a woman's form beneath it, which\nhung limply from the flagstaff.\n\nThen Wessex understood.\n\nHe had already drawn nigh, attracted by idle curiosity, but now with one\nbound he reached the steps. Striking out with his fists at two or three\nmen who barred the way, he suddenly stood confronting these miscreants,\nthe light of the torch glowing on the rich silk of his doublet, the\njewelled agraffe of his hat, his proud, serious face almost distorted by\noverwhelming wrath.\n\n\"What damnable piece of mischief is this?\" he said peremptorily.\n\nHe had scarcely raised his voice, for they were all silent, having\nretreated somewhat at sight of this stranger who barred the way.\n\nThe instinct of submission and deference to the lord was inborn in the\ncountry lout of these days. Their first movement was one of respectful\nawe. But this was only momentary. The excitement was too great, too\nreal, to give way to this gallant, alone with only an elegant sword to\nstand between him and the mad desire for the witch's death.\n\n\"Out of the way, stranger!\" shouted Matthew lustily from the rear of the\ngroup, \"this is no place for fine gentlemen. Up with thy torch, John the\nsmith! No one interferes here!\"\n\n\"No! no! forward, John the smith!\" exclaimed the others as with one\nvoice.\n\nBut John the smith, torch in hand, could not very well advance. The fine\ngentleman was standing on the steps above him with a long pointed sword\nin his hand.\n\n\"The first one of you who sets foot on these steps is a dead man,\" he\nhad said as soon as the shouts had subsided.\n\nJohn the smith did not altogether care to be that notable first.\n\n\"Here! Harry, old friend,\" added the Duke, calling his dog to his side,\n\"you see these miscreants there, when I say 'Go!' you have my permission\nto spring at the throat of the man who happens to be on these steps at\nthe time.\"\n\nHarry Plantagenet no doubt understood what was expected of him. His\ngreat jaws were slightly open, showing a powerful set of very\nunpleasant-looking teeth; otherwise for the moment he looked placid\nenough. He stood at the very top of the steps, his head on a level with\nhis master's shoulder, and was wagging his tail in a pleasant, friendly\nspirit.\n\nMatthew, however, had, not unjustly up to now, earned the respect of his\nfriends. Whilst John the smith was still hesitating, he had already made\na quick mental calculation that one Court gallant and his dog could be\nno real match against five-and-twenty lusty fellows with hard fists, who\nwere determined to get their own way.\n\nHe elbowed his way to the front, pushed the smith aside, and began\nperemptorily--\n\n\"Stranger!----\"\n\n\"Call me not stranger, dolt, I am the Duke of Wessex, and if thou dost\nnot immediately betake thyself elsewhere, I'll have thee whipped till\nthou bleed. Now then, ye louts!\" he added, addressing the now paralysed\ngroup of men, \"off with your caps in my presence--quick's the word!\"\n\nThere was dead silence, broken only by an occasional groan of real,\ntangible fright.\n\n\"The Duke of Wessex! Merciful heavens! he'll have us all hanged!\"\nmurmured Matthew as he fell on his knees.\n\nOne by one, still in complete silence, the caps were doffed. His Grace\nof Wessex! Future King of England mayhap! And they had dared to threaten\nhim!\n\n\"Holy Virgin protect the lot of us!\"\n\nOne man, more alert than his fellows, well in the rear of the group,\nbegan crawling away on hands and knees, hoping to escape unobserved. One\nor two saw his intention and immediately followed him. John the smith\nhad already dropped his torch, which lay smouldering on the ground.\n\nThere was a distinct movement in the direction of general retreat.\n\n\"Well,\" laughed the Duke good-naturedly, \"have you done enough mischief?\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Get ye gone, all of you!--or shall I have to call the guard and\nhave you all whipped for a set of dastardly cowards, eh? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Or better\nstill, hanged, as your leader and friend here suggests--what?\"\n\nThey had no need to be told twice. Still silently they picked up their\ncaps, one or two of them scratched their addled pates. They were ashamed\nand really frightened, and had quite forgotten all about the witch.\n\nThere's nothing like real, personal danger to allay imaginary terrors.\nThe devil was all very well, but he was a long way off, and for the\nmoment invisible, whilst His Grace of Wessex was really there, and he\nwas--well! he was His Grace of Wessex, and that's all about it.\n\nOne by one they edged away, and the darkness soon swallowed them up. The\nDuke never moved until the last of them had gone, leaving only Abra and\nhis henchman cowering in terror beside the platform.\n\nFrom behind a bank of clouds the pale, crescent moon suddenly emerged\nand threw a faint silvery light on the now deserted scene of the\ndastardly outrage.\n\n\"Well, Harry, my friend, I think that's the last of them .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" said\nWessex lightly as he finally put up his sword and mounted the steps to\nthe platform.\n\nMirrab's long strands of golden hair hung like a veil over her face and\nbreast; she had straightened herself out somewhat, but her head was\nstill bent. Her tottering reason was very slowly and gradually returning\nto her.\n\nShe did not even move whilst Wessex undid the leather belts which tied\nher to the flagstaff, and with his heel kicked the faggots to one side.\nShe seemed as unconscious now of her safety as she had been a short\nwhile ago of her impending doom.\n\nAs her last bonds were severed she fell like a shapeless bundle on her\nknees.\n\nHe never looked at her. What was she but a poor tattered wreck of\nhumanity, whom his timely interference had saved from an appalling\ndeath? But he was very sorry for her, because she was a woman, and had\njust gone through indescribable sufferings; in that gentle, impersonal\npity, there was no room for the mere curiosity to know what she was\nlike.\n\nBefore he finally turned to go, he placed a well-filled purse on the\nground, not far from where she was cowering, and said very kindly--\n\n\"Take my advice, girl, and do not get thyself into any more mischief of\nthis sort. Next time there might be no one nigh to get thee out of\ntrouble. Come, Harry,\" he added, calling to his dog, \"time is getting\nlate.\"\n\nAt the foot of the steps he came across the shrinking forms of Abra and\nhis companion. The Duke paused for a moment and said more sternly--\n\n\"As for thee, sirrah, get thee gone, bag and baggage, thy tents and thy\ntrickeries, before the night is half an hour older. The guard shall be\nsent to protect thee; but if thou art still here an hour hence, those\nsobered ruffians will have returned, and nothing'll save thee and thy\nwench a second time.\"\n\nHe waited for no protestations from the abject wizard, and turned his\nsteps towards the river.\n\nAs he was crossing the open space, however, he suddenly felt a tight\ngrip on his cloak; he turned, yet could see nothing, for the capricious\nmoon had once more hidden her light behind a passing cloud, and the\ndarkness, by contrast, seemed all the more intense.\n\nBut he heard a sound which was very like a sob, and then a murmur which\nhad a curious ring of passion in it--\n\n\"Thou hast saved my life .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. 'tis thine .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I give it thee! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nHenceforth, whene'er I read the starlit firmament I'll pray to God that\nthe most glorious star in heaven shall guide thy destiny!\"\n\nHe gave a pleasant laugh, gently disengaged his cloak, and without\nanother word went his way.\n\n\n\n\nPART II\n\nTHE LADY URSULA\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nA BEVY OF FAIR MAIDENS\n\n\nNever in all her life had Her Grace of Lincoln experienced anything so\nawful.\n\nHer very coif, usually a pattern of propriety, looked awry and scarcely\nsober on her dear old head, whilst her round, chubby face, a beautiful\nforest of tangled wrinkles, expressed the most dire distress, coupled\nwith hopeless, pathetic bewilderment.\n\n\"Well?\" she repeated over and over again in breathless eagerness.\n\nShe seemed scarce to notice the pretty picture before her--two young\ngirls standing with arms linked round one another's waists, eyes aglow\nwith excitement, and cheeks made rosy with the palpitating intensity of\nthe narrative.\n\nYet was not Her Grace justly proud of the flock of fair maids committed\nto her charge? What more charming than these two specimens of austere\nQueen Mary's dainty maids-of-honour, with their slim figures in the\nstiff corsets and unwieldy farthingales, their unruly curls held in\nbecomingly by delicate lace coifs, and the sombre panelling of the room\nthrowing up in harmonious contrast the vivid colouring of robes and\nkerchiefs, of lace and of complexion?\n\nBut to-day the Duchess of Lincoln had no eye for the charming sight.\nLeaning well forward in her high, straight-backed chair, her fat,\nbe-ringed fingers were beating a veritable devil's tattoo against its\nbrocaded arms.\n\n\"Alicia, girl, why don't you go on?\" she added impatiently. \"La! I vow\nthe wench'll make me die of choler.\"\n\nAlicia, in the eagerness of telling her thrilling story, had somewhat\nlost her breath; but now she made a vigorous effort to resume.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"Your Grace must remember the night was very dark.\nBarbara and I were strolling by the low wall, when suddenly the clouds\nparted, the river was flooded with light, and just below us, not ten\npaces away, we saw----\"\n\nBut here she broke off suddenly. A look of genuine distress crossed her\npiquant little face; she looked inquiringly at her companion, then at\nthe Duchess, whilst her merry eyes began to fill with tears.\n\n\"Oh! I scarce like to repeat it,\" she said hesitatingly at last, \"for\ntruly I love her so.\"\n\nBut Her Grace was in no mood to pander to girlish sentimentality just\nnow. Her small round eyes, usually alive with good-nature and\nkindliness, were looking positively stern.\n\n\"Go on, child,\" she commanded, \"cannot you see that I am verily sitting\non pins? Was it--was it the Lady Ursula you saw?\"\n\n\"Nay, madam,\" protested Alicia feebly, \"'twas Barbara saw her--I do not\nbelieve that it was Ursula.\"\n\n\"She was wrapped in a dark cloak from head to foot,\" here interposed the\nother young maid. \"When we called she looked up, but, seeing us,\nimmediately fled along the bank.\"\n\n\"Then the clouds obscured the moon again, and we saw nothing more,\"\nresumed Alicia. \"Barbara may have been mistaken.\"\n\nBarbara nodded, quite longing to convince herself that she had indeed\nbeen mistaken. The two girls were getting more and more confused.\nClearly they had no wish to get their absent friend into trouble, and,\nhaving been led into relating their experiences of the night before,\nthey tardily realized that they were collecting storm-clouds over Lady\nUrsula's unsuspecting head.\n\nWith all her good-nature the Duchess was a stern disciplinarian, taking\nherself and her duties very seriously. When the Queen entrusted her with\nthe formation of her own immediate feminine entourage, she also\nexpressed a desire that her maids-of-honour and ladies-in-waiting should\nbe models of decorum and veritable patterns of all the virtues.\n\nThe Court, which had been little else than a name in the old and gloomy\npalace of Richmond and the simple household at Esher, had seen some of\nits old glories revived since Mary's proclamation as sole and royal\nliege lady, Queen Sovereign of England.\n\nBefore and since the coronation, Hampton Court had once more become\nalive with merriment and laughter, with tennis and bowling games,\njousts, suppers, and balls even, as in the best days of King Harry.\nYoung people, who had been only temporarily sobered through the raging\npolitical conflicts of the past few months, quickly reasserted their\ndesire for gaiety and splendour, and the Queen herself, somewhat\nsoftened with the joy of seeing England's loyalty towards her, tacitly\nacquiesced in this return to the ancient magnificence of her father's\ncourt.\n\nMoreover, there were the foreign ambassadors to entertain, all eager to\nsecure the Queen's hand for their respective royal masters, and in the\nmeanwhile equally ready to be impressed with the luxuries of the English\nCourt and the beauty and grace of its ladies.\n\nThe Duchess of Lincoln's task was certes no easy one, since it involved\nthe keeping in order of a very attractive, pleasure-loving, highly\nunruly little flock.\n\nSo far, however, nothing serious had occurred to disturb her\nequanimity. The maids-of-honour placed under her charge had quickly\nsuccumbed to the charm of Her Grace's kindliness, and were easily ruled\nwith the rod of good-nature.\n\nSome scoldings and lectures, an admonition now and then, or a threat of\nmore severe punishment, had readily quelled any incipient\ninsubordination.\n\nBut since the arrival of Lady Ursula Glynde at the Palace matters had\nbecome more serious. The child was so terribly independent, so\nself-willed and unruly, and with it all so sweet and lovable, that the\nDuchess found all her scoldings of absolutely no avail.\n\nUrsula defied her, then kissed and fondled her, rendering her absolutely\nhelpless and defying her authority.\n\nWhen it was discovered that the naughty child had, on the very day\nfollowing Her Majesty's coronation, visited East Molesey Fair, masked\nand veiled, and attended only by weak-willed, silly Margaret Cobham, Her\nGrace felt nigh to having the palsy. But even that unseemly escapade was\nnothing in comparison with the terrible revelations which had recently\ncome to Her Grace's ears. One or two rumours had already gained currency\nthat one of Her Majesty's maids-of-honour had been seen alone and at\nnight outside the purlieus of the Palace. So far, fortunately, the Queen\nknew nothing of this, nor had it been talked about among the gentlemen\nof the Court.\n\nHeavens above! if such a thing were to happen! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\n\n\"A scandal!\" moaned the Duchess piteously, \"a scandal in my department!\nOh, I shall never survive it! If Her Majesty should hear of it, who is\nso austere, so pious! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. And with my lord Cardinal staying in the\nPalace just now. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. What would he think of the morals of an English\nCourt! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Oh! the naughty, wicked child, thus to bring disgrace upon\nus all.\"\n\nSome of the rumours anent Lady Ursula's mysterious nightly wanderings\nhad already reached her; she had placed the other girls under severe\ncross-examination, and finally elicited from them the confirmation of\nher worst fears.\n\n\"Nay, madam,\" rejoined Alicia, tardily smitten with remorse, \"I feel\nsure she means no harm. Ursula is gay, a madcap, full of fun, but she is\ntoo proud to stoop to an intrigue.\"\n\n\"Aye! but, child, she hath vanity,\" said the Duchess, shaking her grey\ncurls, \"and vanity is an evil counsellor. And, remember, 'tis not the\nfirst time she has been seen alone, at night, outside the purlieus of\nthe garden. The Lord protect us! I should never survive a scandal.\"\n\n\"An Your Grace would believe me,\" added Barbara consolingly, \"I think\n'tis but a bit of foolish curiosity on the Lady Ursula's part.\"\n\nBut Her Grace would not be consoled.\n\n\"Curiosity?\" she said. \"Alas! 'tis an evil moment when curiosity leads a\nmaiden out of doors at night .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. alone .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Oh!\"\n\nAnd she made a gesture of such horror, there was such a look of stern\ncondemnation in her kind old face, that the two girls began to feel\nreally afraid as to what might befall that madcap, Ursula Glynde.\n\nNo one had ever seen the Duchess actually angry.\n\nThey were all ready to take up the cudgels for the absent girl now.\n\n\"Nay! 'tis harmless curiosity enough,\" said Alicia hotly. \"Ursula is\nbeing very badly treated.\"\n\n\"Badly treated!\" exclaimed Her Grace.\n\n\"Aye! she is affianced to the Duke of Wessex.\"\n\n\"Well, and what of it, child?\"\n\n\"What of it?\" retorted the girl indignantly, \"she is never allowed to\nsee him. The moment His Grace is expected to arrive in the Queen's\npresence, 'tis--'Lady Ursula, you may retire. I shall not need your\nservices to-day.'\"\n\nAnd looking straight down her pretty nose, dainty Lady Alicia Wrenford\npursed her lips and put on the starchy airs of a soured matron of forty.\n\nThe Duchess of Lincoln threw up her hands in horror.\n\n\"Fie on you, child!\" she said sternly, \"mimicking Her Majesty.\"\n\n\"'Tis quite true what Alicia says,\" here interposed Barbara, pouting;\n\"everything is done to keep Ursula out of His Grace's way. And we, too,\nare made the scapegoats of this silly intrigue.\"\n\n\"Barbara, I forbid you to talk like that!\"\n\n\"I mean nothing disrespectful, madam, yet 'tis patent to every one. Why\nare we relegated to this dreary old chamber this brilliant afternoon,\nwhen my lord the Cardinal and all the foreign ambassadors are at the\nPalace? Why are we not allowed to join the others at tennis, or watch\nthe gentlemen at bowls? Why were Helen and Margaret kept from seeing the\njousts? Why? Why? Why?\"\n\nShe was stamping her little foot, eager, impatient, excited. The Duchess\nfelt somewhat bewildered before this hurricane of girlish wrath.\n\n\"Because Her Majesty ordered it thus, child,\" she said in a more\nconciliatory spirit; \"she hath not always need of all her\nmaids-of-honour round her.\"\n\n\"Nay! that's not the reason,\" rejoined Barbara, \"and Your Grace is too\nclever to believe it.\"\n\n\"You are a silly child and----\"\n\n\"Then we are all silly, for 'tis patent to us all. 'Tis Ursula who is\nbeing kept wilfully away from the Court, or rather from seeing His Grace\nof Wessex, and in order not to make these machinations too obvious, some\nof us are also relegated in the background in her company.\"\n\n\"And 'tis small wonder that Ursula should wish to catch sight of the man\nwhom her father vowed she should wed or else enter into a convent,\"\nconcluded Alicia defiantly.\n\nHer Grace was at her wits' ends. Too clever not to have noticed the\nintrigue to which the girls now made reference, she would sooner have\ndied than owned that her Queen was acting wrongfully or even pettily.\n\nHowever, for the moment she was spared the further discussion of this\nunpleasant topic, for a long, merry, girlish laugh was suddenly heard\nechoing through the great chambers beyond.\n\n\"Hush!\" said the Duchess with reassumed severity, \"'tis that misguided\nchild herself. Now remember, ladies, not a word of all this. I must\nlearn the truth on this scandal, and will set a watch to-night. But not\na word to her.\"\n\nThe next moment the subject of all this animated conversation threw open\nthe heavy oak door of the room. She came running in, with her fair hair\nflying in a deliriously mad tangle round her shoulders, her eyes dancing\nwith glee, whilst above her head she was, with one small hand,\nflourishing a small piece of paper, the obvious cause of this apparently\nuncontrollable fit of girlish merriment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE FAIREST OF THEM ALL\n\n\nThe Duchess was frowning for all she was worth. Alicia and Barbara tried\nto look serious, but were obviously only too ready to join in any frolic\nwhich happened to be passing in Ursula Glynde's lively little head.\n\n\"Oh!\" said the latter, as soon as she had partially recovered her\nbreath. \"Oh! I vow 'tis the best of the bunch.\"\n\nWith the freedom of a spoilt child, who knows how welcome are its\ncaresses, Ursula sidled up to the Duchess of Lincoln and sat down upon\nthe arm of her chair.\n\n\"Your Grace, a share of your seat I entreat,\" she said gaily, heedless\nof stern looks. \"Nay! I'll die of laughing unless you let me read you\nthis.\"\n\n\"Child! child!\" admonished the Duchess, still trying to look severe,\n\"this loud laughter is most unseemly--and your cheeks all ablaze! What\nis it now?\"\n\n\"What is it, sweet Grace?\" responded the young girl. \"A poem! Listen!\"\n\nShe smoothed out the piece of paper, spread it out upon her knee and\nbegan reading solemnly:--\n\n   \"If all the world were sought so farre\n    Who could find such a wight?\n    Her beauty twinkleth like a starre\n    Within the frosty night.\n    Her roseall colour comes and goes\n    With such a comely grace,\n    More ruddier too than doth the rose,\n    Within her lively face.\"\n\n\"And beneath this sonnet,\" she continued, \"a drawing--see!--a heart\npierced by a dagger. _His_ heart--_my_ beauty which twinkleth like a\nstarre!\"\n\nWho could resist the joy and gladness, the freshness, the youth, the\ngirlishness which emanated from Ursula's entire personality? The two\nother girls pressed closely round her, giggling like school-children at\nsight of the rough, sentimental device affixed to the love poem.\n\nThe Duchess vainly endeavoured to keep up a semblance of sternness, but\nshe could not meet those laughing eyes, now dark, now blue, now an\never-changing grey, alive with irrepressible mischief, yet full of\nloving tenderness. She felt that her wrath would soon melt in the\nsunshine of that girlish smile.\n\n\"Lady Ursula, this is most unseemly,\" she said as coldly as she could.\n\"How came you by this poem?\"\n\nUrsula threw her arms round the feebly-resisting old dame.\n\n\"Hush!\" she whispered, \"in your dear old ears! I found it, sweet Duchess\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. beside my stockings .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. when I came out of my bath!\"\n\n\"Horror!\"\n\n\"Now, Duchess! dear, sweet, darling, beautiful Duchess, tell me, who\nthink you wrote this poem? And who--_who_ think you placed it near my\nstockings?\"\n\nThe Duchess was almost speechless, partly through genuine horror, but\nchiefly because a sweet, fresh face was pressed closely to her old\ncheek.\n\n\"'Twas not the Earl of Norfolk,\" continued Ursula meditatively. She\nseemed quite unconscious of the enormity of her offence, and sought the\neyes of her young friends in confirmation of these various surmises. \"He\ncannot write verses. Nor could it be my lord of Overcliffe, for he would\nnot know where to find my stockings.\"\n\n\"The vanity of the child!\" sighed Her Grace. \"Think you these great\ngentlemen would write verses to a chit of a girl like you?\"\n\nBut her kind eyes, resting with obvious pride on the dainty figure\nbeside her, belied the severity of her words.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Ursula decisively, \"bad ones!--not such beautiful verses\nas these.\"\n\nThen she went on with her conjectures.\n\n\"And there's my lord of Everingham, and the Marquis of Taunton, and----\"\n\n\"His Grace of Wessex,\" suggested Alicia archly, despite the Duchess's\nwarning frown.\n\n\"Alas, no!\" sighed Ursula, \"for he has never been allowed to see me.\"\n\n\"Ursula!\" came in ever-recurring feeble protests from the old dowager.\n\nBut the young girl was wholly unabashed.\n\n\"But he _will_ see me--before to-night,\" she said.\n\nThe others exchanged significant glances.\n\n\"To-night?\"\n\n\"Yes! What have I said? Why do you all look like that?\"\n\n\"Because your conduct, child, is positively wanton,\" said the Duchess.\n\nBut Ursula only hugged the kind old soul all the more closely.\n\n\"Now--now,\" she coaxed, \"don't be angry, darling. There!--look!\" she\nadded with mock horror, \"your coif is all awry.\"\n\nWith deft fingers she rearranged the delicate lace cap over Her Grace's\nwhite curls.\n\n\"So,\" she said, \"now you look pretty again--and your nice, fat cheeks\nhave the sweetest of dimples. Nay, I vow, all these young gallants only\nsigh with love for me because _you_ frown on them so!\"\n\n\"What a madcap!\" sighed the Duchess, mollified.\n\n\"You won't be angry with me?\" queried the girl earnestly.\n\n\"Nay! that depends what mad pranks you have been after.\"\n\n\"Sh--sh!--sh!--'tis a deadly secret. Barbara, Alicia, come a little\ncloser.\"\n\nShe paused a moment, whilst all three of them crowded round Her Grace of\nLincoln's chair.\n\nThen Ursula said solemnly--\n\n\"The Queen is in love with my future husband!\"\n\nThe Duchess of Lincoln nearly fell backwards in a faint.\n\n\"Ursula!\" she gasped.\n\n\"Nay, that's not the secret,\" continued Ursula, quite unperturbed, \"for\nthat is town-talk, and every one at Court knows that she won't let him\nsee me for fear he should fall in love with me. And my lord Cardinal is\nfurious because he wants the Queen to marry Philip of Spain, and he is\nwishing His Grace of Wessex down there, where all naughty Cardinals go.\"\n\n\"Child! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. child! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"But the days are slipping by, darling,\" added the young girl, with just\na shade of seriousness in her eyes. \"All these intriguers may fight as\nmuch as they like, but if I do not wed His Grace of Wessex, if he should\nbe inveigled into marrying the Queen, I must to the convent. My dear\nfather made me swear it on his deathbed, when I was beside myself with\ngrief, and scarce knew what I did. 'There is but one true gentleman to\nwhom I would trust my child,' he said to me; 'swear to me, Ursula, that\nif Wessex claims you not, that you will never marry any one else, but\nspend your days in happy singleness in a convent. Swear it, little one.'\nHe was so ill, so dear, I swore and----\"\n\n\"The convent is the proper place for such a feather-brain as yourself,\"\nconcluded the Duchess with as gruff a voice as she could command.\n\n\"But I do not wish to be a nun,\" protested Ursula, as tears began to\ngather in her eyes, \"and I do want to wed Wessex, who is handsome--and\ngallant--and witty--and--and,\" she added coquettishly, \"when he sees\nme--I vow he'll not let me go to a convent either, so----\"\n\nShe leant closer to the kind dowager and once more whispered\nconfidentially in her ear.\n\n\"So, as the Queen is engaged in prayers for at least half an hour, I've\nsent His Grace word by one of the pages that the Duchess of Lincoln\ndesired his presence in this chamber--here!\"\n\nBut this was really past bearing.\n\n\"I! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" exclaimed the Duchess in horror. \"I? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. desire his\npresence? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Merciful heavens! what will His Grace think?\"\n\nOnce more Ursula, like the veritable child that she was, was dancing\nlike mad round the room, now alone, clapping her tiny hands together,\nthen seizing one of her companions by the waist, she whirled with her,\nround and round, until she fell back breathless against the Duchess's\nchair. And all the while her tongue went prattling on, now talking at\ntop speed, anon singing out the words in the madness of her glee.\n\n\"And he is coming, dear Duchess,\" she said. \"'He'll attend upon Her\nGrace at once!' these were his words to that pet of a page, and he'll\nsee me--and--and----\"\n\nNow she paused, kneeling beside her old friend, putting coaxing arms\nround the bulky figure of the kind soul.\n\n\"But don't tell him my name all at once, Duchess darling,\" she whispered\nentreatingly; \"let him fall in love with me without knowing that I am\nhis affianced bride--for that might prejudice him against me. Just\nmumble something when he asks my name, and let me do the rest. Give me\nanother kiss, darling. Alicia--Alicia,\" she cried in feverish anxiety,\n\"is my kerchief straight at the back? and--and--oh, my hair!\"\n\nStill in that same madly-excited mood, she ran to a small oval mirror\nwhich hung on one of the walls, close to the great bay window.\n\nThe Duchess during that brief moment's respite tried to collect her\nscattered wits.\n\n\"But oh! what shall I say to His Grace?\" she moaned distractedly.\n\"Child! child! to your folly there is no end!\"\n\nA quickly smothered shriek from Ursula now brought the other girls to\nher side in the embrasure. She was pointing across the court to the\ngateway beneath the clock tower.\n\n\"He is coming!\" she cried, with a slightly nervous tremor in her voice.\n\"It is he, with my lord Everingham; they are laughing and talking\ntogether. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Oh, how handsome he looks!\" she added enthusiastically.\n\"My future husband, _my_ lord, not the Queen's--mine own, mine own!\nAlicia, tell me, hast ever seen a more goodly sight than that of _my_\nfuture husband in that beautiful silken doublet and with that dear, dear\ndog of his walking so proudly behind him? Harry Plantagenet, thou'rt a\nlucky dog, and I'll kiss thee first, and--and----\"\n\nThen she ran back to the Duchess.\n\n\"Two minutes to mount the stairs, two more to cross the Great Hall, then\nthe watching chamber, the presence chamber. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. In six minutes he will\nbe here--hush!--I hear a footstep! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Holy Virgin, how my heart\nbeats!\"\n\nThere had come a discreet knock at the door. All four women were too\nexcited to respond, but the next moment the door was opened and a young\npage, dressed in the same gorgeous livery which Henry VIII had\noriginally prescribed, entered and bowed to the ladies.\n\nThen he turned to the Duchess of Lincoln.\n\n\"Her Majesty the Queen desires the immediate presence of Her Grace and\nof her maids-of-honour in the Oratory.\"\n\nThere was dead silence in the room whilst the page once more bowed in\nthe elaborate manner ordained by Court etiquette; then he walked\nbackwards to the door, and stood there, holding it open ready for the\nladies to pass.\n\n\"No, no, no!\" whispered Ursula excitedly, as the Duchess immediately\nrose to obey.\n\n\"Ladies!\" commanded Her Grace.\n\n\"One minute, darling,\" entreated Ursula, \"just one short little minute!\"\n\nBut where the Queen's commands were concerned Her Grace of Lincoln was\nadamant.\n\n\"Ladies!\" she ordered once more.\n\nAlicia and Barbara, though terribly disappointed at the failure of the\nexciting conspiracy, were ready enough to obey. Ursula wildly ran back\nto the window.\n\n\"I can see his silhouette and that of my lord Everingham slowly moving\nacross the Great Hall,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh! why is he so slow?\"\n\nThe Duchess turned to the page.\n\n\"Precede!\" she commanded. \"We'll follow.\"\n\nShe then pointed to the door. Alicia and Barbara, endeavouring to look\ngrave, walked out with becoming dignity.\n\nHer Grace went up to Ursula, who was still clinging to the window\nembrasure with passionate obstinacy.\n\n\"Lady Ursula Glynde,\" she said sternly, \"if you do not obey Her\nMajesty's commands instantly, you'll be dismissed from the Court this very\nday.\"\n\nAnd while His Grace of Wessex was slowly wending his way towards the\nchamber where he had been so eagerly expected, Lady Ursula, defiant and\nrebellious, was being peremptorily marshalled off in an opposite\ndirection.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nINTRIGUES\n\n\nWhen Wessex, accompanied by his friend, reached the room which so lately\nwas echoing with merry girlish laughter, he was met by a page, deputed\nby the Duchess of Lincoln to present her excuses to His Grace for her\nnon-appearance.\n\n\"Nay! marry, this is the bravest comedy ever witnessed,\" laughed the\nDuke, when the boy had gone.\n\n\"What, my lord?\" asked Everingham with seeming unconcern.\n\n\"A comedy, friend, in which the Queen, Her Grace of Lincoln, you, and\nHis Eminence the Cardinal, all play leading r\u00c3\u00b4les.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Well done, man! Nay! I know not yet which of you will win; but this I\nknow, that whilst I do my best to whisper sweet nothings in Her\nMajesty's ear, you are pleased, the Cardinal is furious, and the Duchess\nof Lincoln discreetly keeps my affianced bride out of my way.\"\n\n\"For this at least Your Grace should be grateful,\" rejoined his friend\nwith a smile.\n\n\"Grateful that other people should guide my destiny for me? Well,\nperhaps! 'Twould certes have been ungallant to flee from danger, when\ndanger takes the form of a future wife. I cannot picture myself saying\nto a lady: 'Madam, honour demands that I should wed you, and thus hath\nput it out of my power ever to love you.' But since the Lady Ursula is\nso unapproachable, marry!--methinks I am almost free!\"\n\n\"Perchance it is the lady herself who avoids Your Grace.\"\n\n\"Nay! undoubtedly she does. Poor girl! how she must hate the very\nthought of me. Her dear father, I fear me, was wont to sing my praises\nin her childish ears; now that she hath arrived at years of discretion,\nmy very name must have become an obsession to her. Obviously even a\nconvent must be preferable. Then why this mad desire to keep us apart?\nMutual understanding would do that soon enough.\"\n\nThe two men had once more turned to go back the way they came; slowly\nthey strolled across the vast and lofty rooms and through the Great\nHall, which, deserted at this time of day, was the scene of so much\ngaiety and magnificence during the evening hours.\n\n\"Your Grace, methinks, must be mistaken,\" said Everingham after a while;\n\"there is, at any rate on the part of your friends, no desire to keep\nyou and the Lady Ursula apart; you are best judge of your own honour, my\nlord, and no one would presume to dictate to you; but the most sensitive\nconscience in England could but hold the opinion that, whilst the lady\nmay feel bound by her promise to her father, you are as free as\nair--free to wed whom you choose.\"\n\n\"By the mass! what an anomaly, friend! Free to wed! free to wear\nfetters! the most terrible chains ever devised by the turpitude of man.\"\n\n\"Marriage is a great institution----\"\n\n\"Nay! 'tis an evil one, contrived out of malice by priests and old maids\nto enchain a woman who would rather be free to a man who speedily\nbecomes bored.\"\n\n\"Nay! but when that woman is a queen?\"\n\n\"Take off her crown and what is she, friend?\" rejoined His Grace\nlightly. \"A woman .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. to be desired, of course, to be loved, by all\nmeans--but at whose feet we should only recline long enough to make all\nother men envious, and one woman jealous.\"\n\nEveringham frowned. He hated this flippant, careless mood of his friend.\nHe did not understand it. To him the idea of such a possibility as a\nunion with the Queen of England was so great, so wonderful, so\nsuperhuman almost, that he felt that the man who deserved such\nincommensurate honour should spend half his days on his knees, thanking\nGod for such a glorious destiny.\n\nThat Wessex hung back when Mary herself was holding out her hand to him\nseemed to this enthusiast almost a sacrilege.\n\n\"But surely you have ambition, my lord?\" he said at last.\n\n\"Ambition?\" replied Wessex with characteristic light-heartedness. \"Yes,\none!--to be a boy again.\"\n\n\"Nay! an you were that now, you could not understand all that England\nexpects of you. The Queen is harassed by the Cardinal and the Spanish\nambassador. Philip but desires her hand in order to lay the iron heel of\nSpain upon the neck of submissive England. Your Grace can save us all.\nMary loves you, would wed you to-morrow.\"\n\n\"And send me to the block for my infidelities--supposed or real--the day\nafter, and be free to wed Philip or the Dauphin after all.\"\n\n\"I'll not believe it.\"\n\n\"Friend! do you know what you ask of me? To marry--that is to say to\ngive up all that makes life poetic, beautiful, amusing, the love which\nlasts a day, the delights which live one hour, woman in her most\nalluring aspect, the unattainable; and in exchange what do you offer\nme--the smaller half of a crown.\"\n\n\"The gratitude of a nation .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" protested Everingham.\n\n\"Ah! A woman, however fickle she may be, is more constant than a nation\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. As for gratitude? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. nay, my lord .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. let us not speak of the\ngratitude of nations.\"\n\n\"This is not your last word, friend,\" pleaded Lord Everingham earnestly.\n\nThey had reached the foot of the stairs, and were once more under the\ngateway of the clock tower, where Lady Ursula Glynde had caught sight of\nthem from the great bay-window opposite.\n\nIt was a glorious afternoon. October, always lovely in England, was more\nbeautiful and mellow this year than it had ever been. Wessex paused a\nmoment, with his slender hand placed affectionately on his friend's\nshoulder. He looked round him--at the great windows of the hall, the\nvast enclosure of the Base Court beyond, the distant tower of the chapel\nvisible above the fantastic roofs and gables of Henry VIII's chambers,\nthe massive, imposing grandeur of the great pile which had seen so many\ntragedies, witnessed so many sorrows, so many downfalls, such treachery\nand such horrible deaths. A shudder seemed to go through his powerful\nframe, a look of resolution, of pride, and of absolute disdain crept\ninto his lazy, deep-set eyes. Then he said quietly--\n\n\"That is my last word, friend. I'll never be made a puppet on which to\nhang the cloak of political factions and intrigues. My life belongs to\nmy country, but neither my liberty nor my self-respect. If my friendship\nwill help to influence the Queen into refusing to wed the King of Spain\nI'll continue to exert it to the best of my ability, but I'll not become\nHer Majesty's lapdog, nor the tool of my friends.\"\n\nThen once more the hardness and determination vanished from his face;\nthe nonchalance and careless idleness of the grand seigneur was alone\nvisible now.\n\nWith easy familiarity he linked his arm through that of Everingham.\n\n\"Shall we rejoin Her Majesty on the terrace?\" he said lightly. \"She will\nhave finished her orisons, and will be awaiting us. Come, Harry!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nHIS EMINENCE\n\n\nA merry company was gathered on the terrace, which, fronting the\nill-fated Cardinal Wolsey's rooms, descended in elegantly sloping grades\ndown to the old Pond Garden, giving an exquisite view across the tall,\ntrim hedges, the parterres gay with late summer flowers, and the green\nbosquets of lilac and yew, to the serpentine river and distant landscape\nbeyond.\n\nMary Tudor had indeed finished her afternoon orisons. She had recited\nher rosary in the chapel, kneeling before the altar and surrounded by\nher maids-of-honour: no doubt she had prayed for the Virgin's help to\naid her in the accomplishment of the one great wish which lay so near to\nher heart.\n\nShe was this afternoon expecting the arrival of a special envoy from His\nHoliness the Pope, and had to curtail her prayers in consequence. She\nhad strolled back to the terrace, because His Eminence the Cardinal de\nMoreno was there, the ambassador of His Most Catholic Majesty the King\nof Spain, also the Duc de Noailles, who represented the King of France,\nand Scheyfne, who watched over the interests of the Emperor Charles V in\nthis game of political conflicts, wherein the hand of the Queen of\nEngland was the guerdon.\n\nMary Tudor watched them all with a sleepy eye. She felt dreamy and\ncontented this beautiful afternoon: was not the envoy from Rome bringing\nher a special blessing from His Holiness? and what could that blessing\nbe but the love of the one man in all the world to whom she would\ngladly have given her hand to hold and her lips to kiss?\n\nShe sighed as she settled herself down on the straight-backed chair\nwhich she affected. Noailles and Scheyfne hurried eagerly towards her.\nHis Eminence bowed low as she approached, but her eyes wandered\nrestlessly round her in search of the one form dear to her, and she\nfrowned impatiently when she missed the proud, handsome face, whose\nsmile alone could bring hers forth in response.\n\nShe listened with but half an ear to Noailles' platitudes, or to His\nEminence's smooth talk, until close by she heard the well-known step.\nShe did not turn her head. Her heart, by its sudden, rapid beating, had\ntold her that he was there.\n\nMary Tudor was not quite forty then, a woman full of the passionate\nintensity of feeling, characteristic of the Tudors, neither beautiful\nnor yet an adept at women's wiles; but when she heard Wessex' footsteps\non the flagstones of the terrace, her whole face lighted up with that\nradiance which makes every woman fair--the radiance of a whole-hearted\nlove.\n\n\"Nay, my lord Cardinal,\" she said with sudden impatience, \"Your Eminence\nhas vaunted the beauties of Spain long enough to-day. I feel sure,\" she\nadded, half turning towards Wessex, \"that His Grace, though a truant\nfrom our side, will hold a brief for Merrie England against you.\"\n\nThe Duke, as he approached, scanned with a lazy eye the brilliant\ncompany gathered round the Queen; an amused smile, made up partly of\nsarcasm, wholly of insouciance, glimmered in his eyes as he caught the\nfrown, quickly suppressed, which appeared on the Cardinal's shrewd,\nclever face.\n\n\"Nay, His Eminence hath but to look on our Sovereign Lady,\" he said, as\nhe gallantly kissed the tips of the royal hand, graciously extended to\nhim, \"to know that England hath naught to envy Spain.\"\n\nMary, with the rapid intuition of the woman who loves, seemed to detect\na more serious tone in Wessex' voice than was his wont. She looked\ninquiringly at him. The thoughts, engendered in his mind by Everingham's\nearnestness and enthusiasm, had left their shadow over his lighter mood.\n\n\"You look troubled, my lord!\" she said anxiously.\n\n\"What trouble I had Your Grace's presence has already dispelled,\" he\nreplied gently.\n\nIt amused him to watch the discomfited faces of his political\nantagonists, whose presence now Mary seemed completely to ignore. Her\nwhole personality was transformed in his presence: she looked ten years\nyounger; her heavy, slow movements appeared suddenly to gain in\nelasticity.\n\nShe rose and beckoned to Wessex to accompany her. Neither Noailles nor\nScheyfne cared to follow, fearing a rebuke.\n\nHis Eminence the Cardinal de Moreno alone, seeing her turn towards the\ngardens, ventured on a remark.\n\n\"At what hour will Your Majesty deign to receive the envoy of His\nHoliness?\" he asked unctuously.\n\n\"As soon as he arrives,\" replied the Queen curtly.\n\nHis Eminence watched the two figures disappearing down the stone steps\nof the terrace. There was a troubled, anxious look in his keen eyes. The\nfirst inkling had just dawned upon him that perhaps he might fail in his\nmission after all.\n\nA new experience for the Cardinal de Moreno.\n\nWhen Philip of Spain desired to wed Mary of England he chose the one man\nin all Europe most able to carry his wishes through. A perfect grand\nseigneur, veritable prince of the Church, but a priest only in name, for\nhe had never taken Holy Orders, His Eminence shone in every circle\nwherein he appeared, through the brilliancy of his intellect, the charm\nand suavity of his manner, and above all by that dominating personality\nof his, which _willed_ so strongly what he desired to obtain.\n\nWilled it at times--so his enemies said--without scruple. Well, perhaps!\nand if so, why not? would be His Eminence's own argument.\n\nHeaven had given him certain weapons: these he used in order to get\nHeaven's own ends. And in the mind of the Cardinal de Moreno, Heaven was\nsynonymous with the political interests of the Catholic Church. England\nwas too fine a country to be handed over to the schismatic sect without\na struggle, the people were too earnest, too deeply religious to be\nallowed to remain in the enemy's camp.\n\nAnd His Eminence was not only fighting for an important political\nalliance for his royal master, but also for the reconquest of Catholic\nEngland. Wessex, a firm yet unostentatious adherent of the new faith,\nwas to him an opponent in every sense.\n\nWhen the Cardinal first landed in England he had been assured that the\nvolatile and nonchalant Duke would never become a serious obstacle to\nSpanish plans.\n\nThe Duke? Perhaps not. But there was the Queen herself, half sick for\nlove! and women's follies have ere now upset the most deeply laid, most\nimportant plans.\n\n\"Ah, my friend!\" sighed His Eminence with ill-concealed irritation, as\nthe Marquis de Suarez came idly lounging beside him, \"alas! and\nalack-a-day! when diplomacy hath to reckon with women. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Look at\nthat picture!\" he added, pointing with be-ringed, slender, tapering\nfinger to the figures of Wessex and Mary Tudor disappearing amid the\nbosquets of the park, \"and think that the destinies of Europe depend\nupon how a woman of forty can succeed in chaining that butterfly.\"\n\nDon Miguel too had followed with frowning eyes the little comedy just\nenacted upon the terrace. His intellect, though perhaps not so keen as\nthat of his chief, was nevertheless sufficiently on the alert to\nrecognize that Mary Tudor had distinctly intended to administer a snub\nto the entire diplomatic corps, by her marked preference for Wessex'\nsole company.\n\n\"Chance certainly, seems against your schemes and mine, my lord\nCardinal,\" he said; \"for that butterfly is heart-free and indolent,\nwhilst the woman of forty is a queen.\"\n\n\"Indolent, yes,\" mused His Eminence, \"but ambitious?\"\n\n\"His friends will supply the ambition,\" rejoined Don Miguel; \"and the\nCrown of England is a heavy prize.\"\n\nThe Cardinal did not speak for a moment. He seemed buried in thought.\n\n\"I was thinking of the beautiful Lady Ursula Glynde,\" he said\nmeditatively after a while.\n\n\"Beautiful indeed. But His Grace is never allowed to see her.\"\n\n\"But when he does----\"\n\n\"Oh! if I judge him rightly, when he does see her--she is passing\nbeautiful, remember--his roving fancy will no doubt be enchained\nfor--shall we say--half an hour--perhaps half a day. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. What then?\"\n\n\"Half an hour!\" mused the Cardinal. \"Much may be done in half an hour,\nmy lord Marquis.\"\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"In half an hour a woman, even if she be a queen, might become piqued\nand jealous, and the destinies of Europe will be shaped accordingly.\"\n\nHis keen grey eyes were searching the bosquets, trying to read what went\non behind the dark yew hedges of the park.\n\n\"To think that the fate of Catholic Europe should depend upon the chance\nmeeting of a young girl and a Court gallant,\" sighed Don Miguel\nimpatiently.\n\n\"The fate of empires has hung on more slender threads than these ere\nnow, my son,\" rejoined His Eminence quietly; \"diplomacy is the art of\nseeming to ignore the great occasions whilst seizing the small\nopportunity.\"\n\nHe said nothing more, for at that same moment there came to his ears,\ngently echoing across the terrace, the sound of a half-gay,\nhalf-melancholy ditty. A pure, girlish voice was singing somewhere\nwithin the Palace, like a young caged bird behind the bars, at sight of\nthe brilliant sunshine above.\n\nDon Miguel gave a short sarcastic laugh.\n\n\"The Lady Ursula's voice,\" he said.\n\nThen he pointed to the more distant portion of the garden, where Wessex\nand Mary were once more seen strolling slowly back towards the terrace.\n\nA look of expectancy, of shrewd and sudden intuition crept into the\nCardinal's handsome face. The eyes lighted up as if with a quick,\nbright, inward vision, whilst the thin lips seemed to close with a snap,\nas if bent on guarding the innermost workings of the mind.\n\nHe took his breviary from his pocket and began walking along the\nflagstones of the terrace in the direction whence the song had come. His\nhead was bent; apparently he was deeply absorbed in the Latin text.\n\nDon Miguel had not followed him. He knew that his chief wished to be\nalone. He watched the crimson robes slowly fading away into the\ndistance. The Cardinal presently disappeared round the angle formed by\nWolsey's rooms. Beyond these were the fine chambers built by Henry VIII.\nThe sweet song still came from there, wafted lightly on the summer\nbreeze.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE DESTINIES OF EUROPE\n\n\nFive minutes later His Eminence's brilliantly clad figure once more\nreappeared round the angle of the Palace. The breviary was no longer in\nhis hands.\n\nA few moments later he had joined Don Miguel, and together the two men\nwatched the Queen and Wessex, as they drew nearer to the terrace steps.\n\nA smile was on His Eminence's lips, suave, slightly sarcastic, and at\nthe same time triumphant, yet at this very instant when he seemed so\npleased with himself, or with events in general, Mary Tudor was looking\nwith loving anxiety in His Grace of Wessex' eyes.\n\n\"I seem unable to cheer you to-day, my dear lord,\" she said. \"What has\nbecome of your usual gay spirits?\"\n\n\"Gone eavesdropping on my lord Cardinal,\" replied the Duke with a smile,\nas he spied the crimson robes on the top of the steps, \"to find out how\nsoon a King of Spain will rule over England and capture the heart of our\nQueen.\"\n\nMary paused and suddenly laid an eager hand on his wrist.\n\n\"Methought you cared nothing for the affairs of state,\" she said with\nsome sadness, \"and still less as to who shall rule over the heart of\nyour Queen.\"\n\n\"Shall I dismiss the Spanish ambassador?\" she added in an excited\nwhisper, \"and His Eminence?--and M. de Noailles? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. all of them?\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I have not yet given my answer. Will you dictate it, my lord?\"\n\nHe looked up and saw the Cardinal's piercing eyes fixed steadily upon\nhim. For one moment he hesitated. His Eminence looked so sure of\nhimself, so proud of his ascendency over this impulsive woman, that just\nfor the space of five seconds the thought crossed his mind that he would\nyield to the entreaties of his friends, and wrest the crown of England\nfrom the grasping hands of these foreigners, all eagerly waiting to\nsnatch it for themselves.\n\nAs the Cardinal himself had said, but a short while ago, \"the destinies\nof empires oft hang on more slender threads than these.\" No doubt none\nknew better than the shrewd Spaniard himself, how nigh he was at that\nmoment to losing the great game which he played.\n\nWho knows?--if at this instant the sudden commotion on the terrace had\nnot stopped the words on Wessex' lips, how different might have been the\ndestinies of England! But just as His Grace would have spoken, the\nmajor-domo's voice rang out:--\n\n\"The envoy of His Holiness the Pope awaits Her Majesty in the audience\nchamber.\"\n\n\"The envoy of His Holiness,\" said His Eminence with his usual suavity,\nas he stepped forward to meet the Queen, \"and I am to have the honour of\nintroducing him to your Majesty.\"\n\nThe major-domo, who had announced the news, was standing at some little\ndistance with the pages who had accompanied him. The rest of the Court\nhad dispersed when Mary strolled off with the Duke; only two or three\nladies, in immediate attendance on the Queen, were laughing and\nchattering close by.\n\nThe Palace itself seemed astir with new movement and life, horses were\nstamping in the flagged courts, men were heard running and shouting,\nwhilst the rhythmic sound of a brass trumpet at intervals announced the\nimportant arrival.\n\nBut through all this noise and bustle, the sweet, sad ditty sung by a\nfresh young voice still seemed to fill the air.\n\nMary was visibly chafing under this sudden restraint put upon her by\nrigid ceremonial. His Holiness' envoy could not be kept waiting, though\nshe, poor woman, was burning with desire to prolong the happy\n_t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_ with the man she loved.\n\nShe felt His Eminence's eyes watching her every movement. She threw him\na defiant look, then peremptorily ordered the major-domo and the pages\nto precede her.\n\nHis Grace of Wessex, on the other hand, seemed obviously relieved. He\nhad turned his head in the direction whence came that girlish song, and\nappeared to be listening intently.\n\n\"Will you accompany us, my lord?\" said the Queen in a tone of obvious\ncommand. \"I must not keep the envoy of His Holiness waiting, and have\nneed of your presence.\"\n\nShe placed her hand on his arm. Respect and chivalry compelled him to\nobey, yet he seemed loath to go.\n\n\"The Lady Ursula's song seems to fascinate His Grace of Wessex,\"\nwhispered Don Miguel in His Eminence's ear.\n\n\"Hush! the small opportunity, my lord Marquis,\" whispered the Cardinal\nin reply.\n\n\"Have I the honour of following Your Majesty?\" he added respectfully,\nbowing to the Queen.\n\n\"Nay, on our left, Your Eminence,\" rejoined Mary coldly.\n\nHer right hand was still on Wessex' arm, and slowly, as if reluctantly,\nshe began to move in the direction of the Palace. Don Miguel, at an\nalmost imperceptible sign from his chief, had quickly disappeared down\nthe terrace steps.\n\n\"Ah! my breviary!\" suddenly exclaimed His Eminence in great\nperturbation. \"I forgot it on the terrace!--the Nuncio will desire a\nprayer, and I am helpless without my Latin text! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. If Your Majesty\nwill deign to forgive one moment. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHe made a movement as if he would turn back.\n\nFrom the further end of the terrace the young singer was continuing her\nsong.\n\n\"Will Your Eminence allow me?\" said the Duke of Wessex with alacrity.\n\n\"With pleasure, my dear lord,\" responded the Cardinal urbanely. \"Ah! had\nI your years and you mine, 'twere my pleasure to serve you. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. And\nHer Majesty will excuse .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" he added pointedly, for His Grace was\nquite ready to withdraw, whilst Mary was equally prepared to stop him\nwith a look. \"Will Your Majesty deign to place your hand on my arm? The\nenvoy of His Holiness the Pope awaits your Most Catholic Majesty.\"\n\nHe was standing before her, outwardly respectful and full of deference.\nThe pages and ladies had already disappeared within the Palace, whilst\nthe Duke of Wessex, taking the Queen's silence for consent, had turned\nback towards the distant part of the terrace.\n\nMary, with all her weaknesses where her affections were concerned, was\ntoo proud to let this Spaniard see that she felt baffled and not a\nlittle humiliated. She guessed that this had been a ruse, a trap into\nwhich she had fallen. How it had all been done she knew not, but she\ncould easily guess why.\n\nShe smothered the angry words which had risen to her lips, and without\nlooking either to the right or left of her, she walked quickly towards\nthe Palace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTHE HAND OF FATE\n\n\nUrsula had had a good cry.\n\nShe was a mere girl, only just out of her teens; she had been hideously\ndisappointed and had given way to a paroxysm of tears, just like a child\nthat has been cheated of its toys.\n\nAs far as her actual feelings for Wessex were concerned, she scarcely\ntroubled to analyse them. As a tiny child she had worshipped the gallant\nboy, who had always been pointed out to her as the pattern of what an\nEnglish nobleman should be, and moreover as the future husband who was\nto rule over her destiny.\n\nNo doubt that the Earl of Truro, lying on his deathbed, had but little\nreal perception of what he was doing, when he forced his daughter to\nswear that she would marry Wessex or remain single to the end of her\ndays.\n\nBut Ursula was thirteen years old then, and held an oath to her father\nto be the most sacred thing in the world. She had not seen Wessex for\nsome years, but her girlish imagination had always endowed him with all\nthose chivalrous attributes which her own father, whom she idolized, had\nalready ascribed to him.\n\nLove? Well, it scarce could be called that as yet. In spite of her score\nof years, Ursula had remained a child in thought, in feelings, in\ntemperament. She had spent the last six or seven years within the\nprecincts of old Truro Castle, watched over by her late father's\nfaithful servants, who brought her up and worshipped her, taught her\nwhat they knew, and obeyed her implicitly.\n\nHer one idea, however, had remained, that of a marriage with Wessex. By\nright and precedence she could claim a place in the Queen of England's\nimmediate entourage. As soon as she was old enough she asserted this\nclaim, and journeyed to Esher in charge of an old aunt, who had\nsupervised her education since her father's death.\n\nSince then her one desire had been to meet the man to whom she had\npledged her troth. She had seen him, oh! scores of times, since the day\non which he came back to the Court, but Mary Tudor, bent on winning his\nlove, had resolutely kept him away from the beautiful girl who, she\ninstinctively felt, would prove a formidable rival.\n\nIt had been easy enough up to now. His Grace, partly in order to please\nhis friends, even if only half believing that his influence would\nprevent Mary Tudor from contracting an alien marriage, had been in\nconstant attendance on the Queen.\n\nUrsula, on the other hand, had been relegated into the background. She\nknew this well and chafed at the restraint. Something seemed to tell her\nthat if she could but see the Duke he would easily realize that it would\nnot be very hard to fulfil the old earl's promise. She knew that she was\nbeautiful, her own mirror and the admiration of the Court gallants had\nalready told her that, and at the same time she felt within herself a\nmagnetism which must inevitably draw him towards her.\n\nBut time was speeding on. Ursula's quick intelligence had very soon\ngrasped the threads of the present political situation, whilst Mary\nTudor, on the other hand, made no secret of her love for Wessex. The\nyoung girl was well aware of the many intrigues which were being hatched\nround the personality of the man whom she looked upon as her affianced\nhusband, and guessed how much these were aided by the enamoured Queen.\n\nHis Eminence the Cardinal, the Duc de Noailles, Scheyfne, Don Miguel de\nSuarez, all were seeking to obtain a definite promise from Mary. The\nEnglish faction, on the other hand, hoped to force the Duke into a\nmarriage which was obviously distasteful to him.\n\nUrsula, in the midst of these contending parties, was, nevertheless,\ndetermined to gain her end. Too unsophisticated to attempt a serious\nintrigue, she relied on her woman's instinct to guide her to success.\nHer little plot to bring His Grace to her presence that afternoon had\nfailed, probably owing to the Queen's keen acumen; and the young girl,\nfor the first time since her arrival at Court, felt genuinely mortified\nand not a little despairing of ultimate triumph.\n\nThe Duke, evidently, had no desire to meet her, or he would have\naccomplished that end somehow. There was not much that His Grace wished\nthat did not sooner or later come to pass.\n\nObviously, for the moment, he was glad enough to remain free of those\nbonds which truly were none of his making. Chivalry alone might tempt\nhim to fulfil Lord Truro's dying wishes, for the late Earl and the\nDuke's own father had been the closest of friends. Ursula's pride,\nhowever, would not allow her to appeal to that chivalry; what she wanted\nwas to gain his love.\n\nOut of her childish admiration for the boy had grown a kind of poetic\ninterest in the man, more than fostered by the great popularity enjoyed\nby Wessex, and the praises of his personality sung on every side. Ursula\nwas still too young to be in love with aught else save with love itself,\nwith her own imaginative fancy, her own conception of what her future\nhusband should be.\n\nHe should be good to look at--like Wessex. High-born and gracious--like\nWessex. A king among men, witty and accomplished--like Wessex.\n\n\"Holy Virgin! let me have him for mine own!\" was her constant, childish\nprayer.\n\nThe girl was not yet a woman.\n\nThus musing and meditating, she strolled out into the garden, singing as\nshe went. All the maids-of-honour had been bidden to wait on Her Majesty\nin the audience chamber, save Lady Ursula Glynde and Mistress Margaret\nCobham, whose services would not be required. The Duchess of Lincoln,\nshrewdly guessing from this summons that His Grace of Wessex was in the\nQueen's company, had given the two young maids leave to wander whither\nthey pleased.\n\nLazy Margaret had pleaded a headache and curled herself up in a\nwindow-embrasure with the express intention of doing nothing at all; but\nUrsula, with a burning desire for freedom and a longing for flowers,\nbirds, and sunshine, had wandered out into the open.\n\nA parterre of marguerites was laid out close to the terrace. Mooning,\ndreaming, singing, she had picked a bunch of these and was mechanically\nplucking their snow-white petals one by one.\n\nDid she guess what a dainty picture she made, as she stood for one\nmoment beside the pond, her shimmering gown of delicate white glistening\nagainst a background of dark green yews, her fair hair shining like gold\nbeneath the soft rays of the October sun? Her sweet face was bent down,\nearnestly intent upon consulting the flowery oracle: a delicate shadow,\nthat soft pearly grey tone beloved of Rubens, fell upon her girlish\nbreast, her soft round arms, the dainty hands which held the marguerite.\n\n\"He loves me,\" she said, half audibly, \"a little .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. passionately\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. not at all. He loves me .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. a little. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nSo wrapped up was she in these important rites, that she did not hear a\nmuffled footstep upon the gravel. The next moment she felt two firm\nhands upon her waist, whilst a laughing voice completed the daisy's\nprophecy,--\n\n\"Passionately!\"\n\nShe gave a little gasp, but did not immediately turn to look who the\nintruder was. Her woman's instinct had told her that, and then she\nknew--or guessed--the sound of his voice. The moment had come at last.\nIt had been none of her seeking; she did not pause to think how it had\nall happened, she only felt that he was near her and that her life's\nhappiness depended on whether he thought her fair.\n\nThe pleasant little demon of girlish coquetry whispered to her that, in\nthe midst of this poetic setting of an old-world garden, he would be\nhard to please indeed if he did not fall a victim to her smile.\n\nShe turned and faced him.\n\n\"Ah!\" she said, with a little cry of feigned surprise, \"His Grace of\nWessex! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I vow you frightened me, my lord .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I thought\nthis part of the garden quite deserted, and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and the Duke of Wessex\nat the feet of the Queen.\"\n\nShe looked divinely pretty as she stood there before him, a delicate,\nnervous little blush suffusing her young cheeks, her eyes veiled by a\nfringe of lashes slightly darker than her golden hair. As dainty a\npicture as this fastidious man had ever gazed upon.\n\n\"At your feet, fair one,\" he replied, with undisguised admiration\nexpressed in his every look, \"and burning with jealousy at thought of\nhim, for whose sake your sweet fingers plucked the petal of that\nmarguerite.\"\n\nShe still held the flower, half stripped of its petals; he put out his\nhand in order to take it from her, or perhaps merely for the sake of\ntouching for one second the soft velvet of her own.\n\nHarry Plantagenet, close by, had stretched himself out lazily in the\nsun.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Ursula, a little confused, still a little shy and nervous,\n\"that .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. that was for a favourite brother who is absent .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and I\nwished to know if he had not forgotten me.\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" he replied with deep conviction, \"even for a brother.\"\n\n\"Your Grace is pleased to flatter.\"\n\n\"The truth spoken to one so fair must ever seem a flattery.\"\n\n\"Your Grace. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHe loved to watch the colour come and go in her face, the dainty,\ngirlish movements, simple and unaffected, that little curl which looked\nlike living gold beside the small, shell-like ear. His passionate love\nfor the beautiful was more than satiated at the exquisite picture before\nhim, and then she had such a musical and tender voice; he had heard her\nsinging just now.\n\n\"But you seem to know me, fair one,\" he said after a while.\n\n\"Who does not know His Grace of Wessex?\" she responded, making a pretty\ncurtsy.\n\n\"Then let me be even with you, sweet singer, and tell me your name.\"\n\nUrsula darted a sudden shy look at him. Obviously he was conveying the\ntruth; he did not know who she was.\n\nA quick thought crossed her mind; she looked demurely down her nose and\nsaid placidly,--\n\n\"My name is Fanny.\"\n\n\"Fanny?\"\n\n\"Yes .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you do not like it?\"\n\n\"I didn't before,\" he said with a smile, \"but now I adore it.\"\n\n\"I am getting to like it better too,\" she added thoughtfully.\n\n\"But, sweet Fanny, tell me how is it I never have seen you before.\"\n\n\"Your Grace does not know all the ladies of the Court.\"\n\n\"No! but I thought I knew all the pretty ones. Yet meseems that beauty\nwas but an empty word now that I have seen its queen.\"\n\n\"Ah, my lord! I fear me your reputation doth not wrong you after all!\"\nshe added with a quaint little sigh.\n\n\"Why? What is my reputation?\"\n\n\"They call you fickle, and say the Duke of Wessex loves many women a\nlittle .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but constantly, not at all.\"\n\nHe came a step closer to her, and tried to meet her eyes.\n\n\"Then will you let me prove them wrong?\" he said with sudden\nseriousness, which perhaps then he could not himself have accounted for.\n\n\"I? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" she said artlessly, \"what must I do for that?\"\n\n\"Anything you like,\" he replied.\n\n\"Nay, I have no power; for I fear me nothing short of putting Your Grace\nunder lock and key would cure you of that fickleness.\"\n\n\"Then put me under lock and key,\" he suggested gaily.\n\n\"In an inaccessible tower?\"\n\n\"Wherever you please.\"\n\nShe gave a merry, happy little laugh, for he was standing quite close to\nher now, his proud head slightly bent so that the quick, whispered words\nmight easily reach her ears; and there was an unmistakable look of\nardent admiration in his eyes. A demon of mischief suddenly seized her.\nShe wondered whether he had guessed who she was and tried to nettle him\ninto betraying himself.\n\n\"And to whom shall I give the key of that tower?\" she said demurely. \"To\nthe Lady Ursula Glynde?\"\n\n\"No,\" he replied. \"Come inside and throw the key out of the window.\"\n\n\"But the Lady Ursula?\" she persisted.\n\nHe made a quick gesture of mock impatience.\n\n\"What wanton cruelty to mention that name now,\" he said, \"when mine ears\nare tuned to 'Fanny.'\"\n\n\"Tis wrong they should be so tuned--Lady Ursula, they say, is your\npromised wife.\"\n\n\"But I do not love her .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. never could love her whilst----\"\n\n\"They say she is not ill-favoured.\"\n\n\"Ill-favoured to me, like the bitter pills the medicine man gives us,\nwhilst you----\"\n\nOnce more she interrupted him quickly.\n\n\"You have never seen her,\" she protested, \"you do not even know what she\nis like.\"\n\n\"Nay, I can guess. The Glyndes are all alike--sandy, angular,\nlarge-footed. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nShe laughed, a long, merry, rippling laugh which set his ears tingling\nwith the desire to hear it once again. Ursula was indeed enjoying\nherself thoroughly.\n\n\"They all have brown eyes,\" he continued gaily, \"and just now I feel as\nif I could not endure brown eyes.\"\n\nShe cast down her own, veiling them with her long lashes.\n\n\"What eyes could Your Grace best endure for the moment?\" she said, with\nthe same tantalizing demureness.\n\nBut something magnetic must have passed at that moment between these two\nyoung people, some subtle current from him to her, which forced the\ninnocent young girl to raise her eyes almost against her will. He looked\nstraight into their wonderful depths, and murmured softly,--\n\n\"The very bluest of the blue, and yet so grey, that I should feel they\nmust somehow be green. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nA little shudder had gone through her when first she met his ardent\ngaze; she tried to free herself from a sudden strange and delicious\nfeeling of obsession, and said with somewhat forced merriment now:\n\n\"The Queen has greenish eyes, and Lady Ursula's are grey.\"\n\nThen she held out the marguerite to him.\n\n\"Would you like to know which you love best?\" she added. \"Consult the\nmarguerite, and take one petal at a time.\"\n\nBut he took the hand which held the flower.\n\n\"One petal at a time,\" he whispered. He took the slender fingers and\nkissed each in its turn: \"This the softest .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. that the whitest .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nall rose-tipped .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and a feast for the gods. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"My lord! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Now you are frowning--you are not angry?\"\n\n\"Very angry!\"\n\n\"I'll make amends,\" he said humbly.\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Give me the other hand, and I'll show you.\"\n\n\"Nay! I cannot do that, for we are told that the left hand must never\nknow what the right hand doeth.\"\n\n\"It shall not,\" he rejoined earnestly, \"for I'll tell it a different\ntale.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Give me the hand and you shall know.\"\n\nOverhead in the green bosquets of yew a group of starlings began to\ntwitter. The sun was just beginning to sink down in the west, throwing\nround the head of the fair young girl an aureole of gold. He stood\nwatching her, happy in this the supreme moment of his life. A magic veil\nseemed to envelop him and her, shutting out all that portion of the\nworld which was not poetic and beautiful; and she, the priestess of this\nexquisite new universe in which he had just entered, was smilingly\nholding out her dainty hand to him.\n\nHe seized it, and a sudden wave of passion caused him to bend over it\nand to kiss its soft rosy palm.\n\n\"Nay, my lord,\" she murmured, confused, \"that Your Grace should think of\nsuch follies!\"\n\n\"Yet, when you look at me,\" he said, \"I think of worse follies still.\"\n\n\"Women say that there is no worse folly than to listen to His Grace of\nWessex.\"\n\n\"Do you think they are right?\"\n\n\"How can I tell?\"\n\n\"By listening to me for half an hour.\"\n\n\"Here, in this garden?\"\n\n\"No! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. there! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. by the river. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nAnd he pointed beyond the enclosure of the garden, there where the soft\nevening breeze gently stirred the rushes in the stream.\n\n\"Oh! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. what would everybody say?\" she exclaimed in mock alarm.\n\n\"Nothing! envy of my good fortune would make them dumb.\"\n\n\"But the Queen will be asking for you, and the Duchess of Lincoln\nwondering where I am.\"\n\n\"They shall not find us .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. for we'll pull the boat beyond the reeds\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. just you and I alone .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. with the gloaming all round us .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nand the twitter of the birds when they go to rest. Shall we go? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHer heart had already consented. His voice was low and persuasive, a\nstrange earnestness seemed to vibrate through it, as he begged her to\ncome with him.\n\nSlowly she began to walk by his side towards the stream. She seemed\nscarcely alive now, a being from another world wandering in the land of\ndreams. He said nothing more, for the world was too beautiful for\nspeech. Youth, love, delight were coursing through his veins, and as he\nled the young girl towards the bank it seemed to him as if he were\ntaking her away from this dull world of prose and humanity, far, far\naway through mysterious golden gates beyond the sunset, to a land where\nshe would reign as queen.\n\nThe river beckoned to them, and the soft, misty horizon seemed to call.\nThe intoxicating odour of summer's dying roses filled the air, whilst in\nthe distance across the stream a nightingale began to sing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE ULTIMATUM\n\n\nThe envoy of His Holiness had departed.\n\nMary Tudor had dismissed her ladies, for she wished to speak with the\nCardinal de Moreno alone.\n\nThroughout the audience with the papal Nuncio, His Eminence had already\nseen the storm-clouds gathering thick and fast on the Queen's brow. His\nGrace of Wessex, gone to fetch a breviary left accidentally on the\nterrace-coping, had been gone half an hour, and moreover had not yet\nreturned.\n\nHer Majesty had sent a page to request His Grace's presence. The page\nreturned with the intimation that His Grace could not be found.\n\nSomeone had spied him in the distance walking towards the river, in\ncompany with a lady dressed in white.\n\nThen the storm-clouds had burst.\n\nThe Queen peremptorily ordered every one out of the room, then she\nturned with real Tudor-like fury upon His Eminence.\n\n\"My lord Cardinal,\" she said in a quivering voice, which she did not\neven try to steady, \"an you had your master's wishes at heart, you have\nindeed gone the wrong way to work.\"\n\nThe Cardinal's keen grey eyes had watched Mary's growing wrath with much\namusement. What was a woman's wrath to him? Nothing but an asset, an\nadditional advantage in the political game which he was playing.\n\nNever for a moment did he depart, however, from his attitude of deepest\nrespect, nor from his tone of suave urbanity.\n\n\"I seem to have offended Your Majesty,\" he said gently; \"unwittingly, I\nassure you. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nBut Mary was in no mood to bandy polite words with the man who had\nplayed her this clever trick. She was angered with herself for having\nfallen into so clumsy a trap. A thousand suggestions now occurred to her\nof what she might have done to prevent the meeting between Wessex and\nUrsula, which the Cardinal had obviously planned.\n\n\"Nay! masks off, I pray Your Eminence,\" she said, \"that trick just now\nwith your breviary .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Own to it, man! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. own to it .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. are you\nnot proud to have tricked Mary Tudor so easily?\"\n\nShe was trembling with rage, yet looked nigh to bursting into tears. A\nshade almost of pity crossed His Eminence's cold and clever face. It\nseemed almost wantonly useless to have aided Fate in snatching a young\nand handsome lover from this ill-favoured, middle-aged woman.\n\nBut the Cardinal never allowed worldly sentiments of any kind to\ninterfere, for more than one or two seconds, with the object he had in\nview. The look of pity quickly faded from his eyes, giving place to the\nsame mask of respectful deference.\n\n\"My breviary?\" he said blandly. \"Nay! I am still at a loss to\nunderstand. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Ah, yes! I remember now. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I had left it on the\nbalustrade. His Grace of Wessex, a pattern of chivalry, offered to fetch\nit for me, and----\"\n\n\"A fine scheme indeed, my lord,\" interrupted the Queen impatiently, \"to\nsend the Duke of Wessex courting after my waiting-maid.\"\n\n\"The Duke of Wessex?\" rejoined His Eminence with well-played\nastonishment. \"Nay, methought I spied him just now in the distance,\nkeeping the vows he once made to the Lady Ursula Glynde.\"\n\n\"I pray you do not repeat that silly fairy-tale. His Grace made no\npromise. 'Twas the Earl of Truro desired the marriage, and the Duke had\nhalf forgotten this, until Your Eminence chose to interfere.\"\n\n\"Nay! but Your Majesty does me grave injustice. What have the amours of\nHis Grace of Wessex to do with me, who am the envoy of His Most Catholic\nMajesty the King of Spain?\"\n\n\"'Twere wiser, certainly,\" retorted Mary coldly, \"if the King of Spain's\nenvoy did not concern himself with rousing the Queen of England's\nanger.\"\n\nHis Eminence smiled as amiably, as unconcernedly as before. Throughout\nthe length of a very distinguished career he had often been obliged to\nweather storms of royal wrath. He was none the worse for it, and knew\nhow to let the floods of princely anger pass over his shrewd head,\nwithout losing grip of the ground on which he stood. Nothing ever\nruffled him. Supremely conscious of his own dignity, justly proud of his\nposition and attainments, he had, at the bottom of his heart, a complete\ncontempt for those exalted puppets of his own political schemes. Mary\nTudor, a weak and soured woman, an all-too-ready prey of her own\npassions, swayed hither and thither by her loves and by her hates, was\nnothing to this proud prince of the Church but a pawn in a European game\nof chess. It was for his deft fingers to move this pawn in the direction\nin which he list.\n\n\"Nay,\" he said, with gentle suavity, \"my only desire is to rouse in the\nheart of the Queen of England love for my royal master, the King of\nSpain. He is young and goodly to look at, a faithful and gallant\ngentleman, whom it will be difficult to lure from Your Grace's side,\nonce you have deigned to allow him to kneel at your feet.\"\n\n\"You speak, my lord, as if you were sure of my answer.\"\n\n\"Sure is a momentous word, Your Majesty. But I hope----\"\n\n\"Nay! 'tis not yet done, remember,\" retorted Mary, with ever-increasing\nvehemence, \"and if this trick of yours should succeed, if Wessex weds\nthe Lady Ursula, then I _will_ send my answer to your master, and it\nshall be 'No!'\"\n\nThere was a quick, sudden flash in the Cardinal's eye, a look of\nastonishment, perhaps, at this unexpected phase of feminine jealousy. Be\nthat as it may, it was quickly veiled by an expression of pronounced\nsarcasm.\n\n\"As a trophy for the vanity of His Grace of Wessex?\" he asked pointedly.\n\n\"No!--merely as a revenge against your interference. So look to it, my\nlord Cardinal; the tangle in the skein was made by your hand. See that\nyou unravel it, or you and the Spanish ambassador leave my Court\nto-morrow.\"\n\nWith a curt nod of the head she dismissed him from her presence. He was\nfar too shrewd to attempt another word just now. Perhaps for the first\ntime in his life he felt somewhat baffled. He had allowed his own\nimpatience to outrun his discretion--an unpardonable fault in a\ndiplomatist. He blamed himself very severely for his attempt at\nbrusquing Fate. Surely time and the Duke's own fastidious disposition\nwould have parted him from Mary quite as readily as this sudden meeting\nwith beautiful Lady Ursula.\n\nThe Cardinal had withdrawn from the Queen's presence after an obeisance\nmarked with deep respect. He wished to be alone to think over this new\naspect of the situation. Through the tall bay windows of the Great Hall\nwhich he traversed, the last rays of the setting sun came slanting in.\nHis Eminence glided along the smooth oak floors, his crimson robes\nmaking but a gentle frou-frou of sound behind him, a ghostlike,\nwhispering accompaniment to his perturbed thoughts. Somehow the softness\nof the evening air lured him towards the terrace and the gardens. There\nlacked an hour yet to supper-time, and Mary Tudor was scarce likely to\nbe in immediate need of His Eminence's company.\n\nHe crossed the Clock Tower gates and soon found himself once more on the\nterrace. The gardens beyond looked tenderly poetic in the fast-gathering\ndusk. The Cardinal's shrewd eyes wandered restlessly over the parterres\nand bosquets, vainly endeavouring to spy the silhouettes of two young\npeople, whom his diplomacy had brought together and whom his shrewd wit\nwould have to part again.\n\nHe descended the terrace steps and slowly walked towards the pond,\nwhere, but an hour ago, a sweet and poetic idyll had been enacted. There\nwas nothing to mark the passage of a fair young dream, born this lovely\nOctober afternoon, save a few dead marguerites and the scattered flakes\nof their snow-white petals.\n\nThe Cardinal's footsteps crushed them unheeded. He was thinking how best\nhe could dispel that dream, which he himself had helped to call forth.\n\n\"Woman! woman!\" he sighed impatiently as he looked back upon the\ngraceful outline of the Palace behind him, \"thy moods are many and thy\nlogic scant.\"\n\n\"A tangled skein indeed,\" he mused, \"which will take some unravelling.\nIf Wessex weds the Lady Ursula, the Queen will say 'No' to Philip, out\nof revenge for my interference. She'll turn to Noailles mayhap and wed\nthe Dauphin to spite me, or keep him and Scheyfne dangling on awhile\nwhilst trying to reconquer the volatile Duke's allegiance. But if Wessex\ndoes not wed the Lady Ursula .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. what then? Will his friends prevail?\nYet there's more obstinacy than indolence in his composition, I fancy,\nand the dubious position of King Consort would scarce suit his proud\nGrace. Still, if I do not succeed in parting those two young people whom\nmy diplomacy hath brought together, then Mary Tudor sends me and the\nSpanish Ambassador back to Philip to-morrow.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nAN ARMED TRUCE\n\n\nSo intent was His Eminence in these complicated musings that he scarcely\nnoticed how fast the shadows gathered round him. He had gradually\nwandered down towards the low wall which divided the Palace gardens from\nthe river beyond.\n\nHe had always been very partial to this remote portion of the grounds,\nfor it was little frequented, and he felt that here at least in his\nlonely walks he could lay aside that mask of perpetual blandness which\nhe was obliged to wear all day, whatever his moods might be.\n\nIt was seldom that he met anybody when his footsteps led him thus far.\nGreat was his astonishment therefore when he suddenly spied a figure\nleaning over the wall, evidently intent on prying into the darkness\nbelow.\n\nThe Cardinal drew nearer and recognized Lord Everingham, the closest\nfriend, the most intimate companion His Grace of Wessex was known to\nhave.\n\nThe young man had not heard His Eminence's footsteps on the sanded path;\nhe started on hearing his name.\n\n\"Ah! my lord Everingham,\" said the Cardinal lightly. \"I little thought\nto see any one here. I myself am fond of communing with Nature in these\ngathering shadows; but you are a young man, there are gayer attractions\nfor you within the Palace.\"\n\nIt was too dark by now even for His Eminence's keen eyes to read the\nexpression on Lord Everingham's face. The astute diplomatist, however,\nmore than guessed what the young man's purpose was in thus scanning the\nriver. His Grace of Wessex had not yet returned to the Palace, and it\nwas generally known throughout the Court circle that Her Majesty was\nfurious at his absence.\n\nThe Cardinal's ruse in the early part of the afternoon had been the\nsubject of universal gossip; sundry rumours had also been current that\nthe Duke had been seen in the company of the Queen's most beautiful\nmaid-of-honour.\n\n\"Verily,\" thought His Eminence, \"His Grace's partisans must be on\ntenterhooks. All along they must have dreaded this meeting, which chance\nand diplomacy has so unexpectedly brought about.\"\n\nWas not Wessex' position with regard to the Lady Ursula a peculiar one?\nTied to her and yet free, affianced, yet not necessarily bound, his own\nattitude towards her was sure to be influenced by the girl's own\npersonality.\n\nAnd every cavalier and diplomatist now at Hampton Court readily conceded\nthat the daughter of the Earl of Truro was the most beautiful woman in\nEngland, and the most likely to captivate the roving fancy of His Grace.\n\nNo wonder that my lord of Everingham was anxious for the Duke's return,\nbefore the Queen's access of pique and jealousy had found vent in sudden\nrevenge. But the young Englishman had no desire to display this anxiety\nbefore his triumphant opponent.\n\n\"Like your Eminence,\" he said carelessly, \"I was lured into the garden\nby the softness of the air. The river looked so cool and placid, and\n'tis not often one can hear the nightingale in October.\"\n\n\"Nay! your sudden fancy for the evening breeze is entirely my gain, my\ndear lord,\" rejoined the Cardinal in his most suave manner; \"as a matter\nof fact I was, even at this moment, meditating how best I could secure\nan interview with you.\"\n\n\"With me?\"\n\n\"Yes. Are you not His Grace of Wessex' most intimate friend?\"\n\n\"I have indeed that honour,\" replied Everingham stiffly, \"but I do not\nquite understand how----\"\n\n\"How the matter concerns me?\" interrupted His Eminence pleasantly. \"An\nyou will allow me, I can explain. Shall we walk along this path? I thank\nyou,\" he added courteously, as the young man, after a moment's\nhesitation, turned to walk beside him.\n\n\"Have I been misinformed,\" continued the Cardinal, \"or is it a fact that\nyour lordship is about to quit Hampton Court?\"\n\n\"Only for a very few weeks,\" rejoined Everingham. \"Her Majesty has\nentrusted me with an amicable mission to the Queen Regent of Scotland. I\nstart for town to-night on my way North.\"\n\n\"Ah! then I am only just in time,\" said His Eminence.\n\n\"In time for what?\"\n\n\"In time to correct what we poor mortals are all liable to make, my\nlord--an error.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Everingham, with a touch of sarcasm. \"Your Eminence must\nmake so few.\"\n\n\"Nay! but the error this time is none of my making, my lord. 'Tis you, I\nthink, who look upon me as an enemy.\"\n\n\"Oh! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. your Eminence .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" protested the young man.\n\n\"Well, an antagonist, if you will. Confess that you thought--and still\nthink--that I have been scheming to bring the Duke of Wessex to the feet\nof Lady Ursula Glynde, his promised wife.\"\n\n\"A scheme in which Your Eminence succeeded over well, I fancy,\" retorted\nEveringham bitterly.\n\n\"But that is where you are in error, my dear lord; for, believe me,\nthat, at the present moment, my sole desire is to put an insuperable\nbarrier between His Grace and that beautiful young lady.\"\n\n\"Your sole desire, my lord?\"\n\nAs the night was dark Everingham could see nothing of His Eminence's\nexpression of face. If he had, he probably would only have seen the same\nmask of polite blandness which the Cardinal usually wore.\n\nThe young man, certes, was no match for these astute Spaniards, who had\nall the wiles and artifices of diplomacy at their finger-tips; his love\nfor Wessex and the earnestness of his own political views gave him a\ncertain amount of shrewdness, but even that shrewdness was at fault in\nthe face of this extraordinary statement suddenly made by the Cardinal.\n\n\"You are surprised?\" commented His Eminence.\n\n\"Boundlessly, I confess.\"\n\n\"Ah! Diplomacy is full of surprises. But you are pleased?\"\n\nEveringham, however, was not prepared to admit anything to this man,\nwhose face he could not read, but whose tortuous ways he more than half\nmistrusted.\n\n\"I hardly know how to understand Your Eminence,\" he said guardedly. \"I\nneed hardly say that my fondest hope was to see Queen Mary wedded to\nWessex, for that is common knowledge. But since His Grace's meeting with\nthe beautiful Lady Ursula, I fully expect to hear him declare his\nintention of keeping his troth to her.\"\n\n\"You think her so very irresistible, then?--or His Grace so very\nsusceptible?\"\n\n\"I think that the Duke has always kept at the back of his mind an idea\nthat he was in some measure bound to Lady Ursula.\"\n\n\"Let us add, my lord, that the charm and grace of the lady will\ninevitably tend to develop that idea. Eh?\"\n\n\"And that Your Eminence will probably triumph in consequence.\"\n\n\"You, therefore, my lord, have by now set your heart on undoing what\nto-day's chance meeting may, perchance, have accomplished. By you I also\nmean your friends, the nobility and gentry of England, who would mourn\nto see His Grace wedded to Lady Ursula Glynde.\"\n\n\"Our loss will be your Eminence's gain, probably,\" rejoined Everingham\nwith a sigh.\n\nThe Cardinal waited a moment before he continued the conversation. He\nhad deliberately sought this interchange of ideas. Openness and\nfrankness in matters political were not usually a part of His Eminence's\nprogramme, but this evening he seemed desirous to gain this young\nEnglishman's confidence.\n\n\"But,\" he said after a while, with charming bonhomie, \"but suppose that\ninstead of gloating in the triumph which you, my lord, so readily\nprophesy--suppose that I were to ask you to let me help you--you and\nyour friends--in parting the volatile Duke from his latest flame? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nWould you accept my help?\"\n\n\"Your Eminence .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" murmured Everingham, somewhat at a loss\nwhat to say.\n\n\"You would wish to consult with your friends, eh?\" continued the\nCardinal placidly. \"Lord Derby, Lord Bath, the Earl of Oxford--nay, the\nwhole string of patriotic Englishmen who desire to see one of their own\nkind on the English throne, and naturally look upon me as a monster of\nartifice and vice.\"\n\n\"Your Eminence .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" protested Everingham.\n\n\"Yet what are we but political antagonists, who can honour one another\nin private, whilst rending one another to pieces on the arena of public\nlife? Do you not agree with me, my lord?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Then why should you disdain my help, now that--momentarily--we have the\nsame object in view?\"\n\n\"I am _hors de cause_, Your Eminence, as I have only the next few hours\nat my disposal. After that I go to Scotland.\"\n\n\"Much may be done in a few hours, my lord, with an ounce of luck and a\ngrain of tact.\"\n\n\"But I do not understand why Your Eminence should be at one with me and\nmy friends over this.\"\n\nThe Cardinal smiled with gentle benevolence. Versed though he was in all\nthe tricks and deceptions which were an integral part of his calling, no\none knew better than he did the value of an occasional truth. With easy\nfamiliarity he linked his arm in that of his interlocutor.\n\n\"Nay! your lordship mocks me,\" he said with a light sigh. \"From your\nconversation I have already gathered that you and your friends suspect\nme of having brought about this unwelcome meeting 'twixt His Grace of\nWessex and Lady Ursula Glynde. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"Marry .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" began Everingham with some hesitation.\n\n\"I pray you do not trouble to deny it. Let us admit that it is so. Do\nyou not think then that Queen Mary will have a like suspicion as\nyourself?\"\n\n\"Probably.\"\n\n\"And will, in consequence, turn the floods of her wrath on my innocent\nhead. A woman angered is capable of anything, my lord. My position at\nthis Court would become untenable. My mission probably would fail. Let\nus say that by endeavouring to part His Grace from the Lady Ursula, I\nwould wish to give Her Majesty proof of the fact that I bore no part in\ntheir chance meeting.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" rejoined Everingham, still vaguely suspicious of any\nulterior motive lurking behind the Cardinal's apparent frankness, \"but\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Once His Grace is effectually parted from his new flame, the game will\nstand once more as it did before the unfortunate episode of this\nafternoon .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. unfortunate alike to your interests and to mine. Is that\nnot so?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"I feel, therefore, that until then we ought to be .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. well! if not\nfriends exactly .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. at least allies.\"\n\n\"Only to resume hostilities again, Your Eminence?\"\n\n\"By all means.\"\n\n\"Once His Grace has ceased to think of Lady Ursula, I and my party will\nonce more work heart and soul to bring about the alliance of Wessex with\nthe Queen.\"\n\n\"And I to win the Queen's hand for Philip of Spain. Until then? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Armed truce, Your Eminence.\"\n\n\"And you will accept my help? It may be worth having, you never can\ntell,\" quoth His Eminence with a sarcastic smile, which Everingham could\nnot perceive in the darkness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTHE VEILED WITCH\n\n\nLord Everingham felt not a little perplexed. The Cardinal seemed bent on\npressing his point, and on obtaining a definite promise of friendship,\nwhilst the young man would have preferred to leave the matter _in statu\nquo_, a condition of open and avowed enmity.\n\nMoreover he would have wished to speak with some of his friends. Lord\nSussex and the Earl of Oxford were staying at the Palace. Sir Henry\nJerningham, Arundel, Cheyne, Paget, all hot partisans of Wessex, could\neasily be communicated with. In the meanwhile Everingham was racking his\nbrain for the right word to say: the retort courteous, which would not\nhopelessly alienate His Eminence, if indeed he was seeking temporary\nfriendship.\n\nChance and a zealous night watchman put an abrupt end to Lord\nEveringham's perplexity; even when he was about to speak, a gruff voice\nwhich seemed to come right out of the darkness interrupted him with the\nwell-known call--\n\n\"Who goes there?\"\n\nAlmost immediately afterwards the strong light of a lanthorn was\nprojected on the figure of the Cardinal.\n\n\"How now, friend,\" quoth His Eminence presently, \"art seeking for the\ntruth with that lanthorn of thine?\"\n\nBut already the knave, having recognized the brilliant crimson robes and\nrealized the high quality of their august wearer, had lost himself in a\nveritable maze of humble apologies.\n\n\"I crave Your Eminence's merciful pardon,\" he stammered. \"I did not\nthink .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I am on duty .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHis thin, shrivelled form was scarce distinguishable in the gloom, only\nhis old face, with large bottle-nose, and his pale, watery eyes appeared\ngrotesque and quaint in the yellowish light of his lanthorn.\n\n\"Then fulfil thy duties, friend,\" rejoined the Cardinal, who made it a\npoint always to speak kindly and urbanely, even to the meanest lout.\n\nThe man made a low obeisance and would have kissed His Eminence's hand,\nbut the latter withdrew it gently.\n\n\"Are there marauders about, friend watchman?\" he condescended to ask, as\nthe man prepared to go. \"Thou dost not appear to be very strong, nor yet\nstoutly armed.\"\n\n\"Your Eminence's pardon,\" replied the man, \"'tis for a woman I am told\nto watch.\"\n\n\"A woman?\"\n\n\"By Her Grace the Duchess of Lincoln's orders.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" remarked His Eminence, with sudden interest.\n\n\"Mayhap some thief or vagrant, Your Eminence.\"\n\n\"Aye, mayhap! Then go thy way, good watchman; we'll not hinder thee.\"\n\nSlowly the man shuffled off, dangling his lanthorn before him. The\nCardinal watched the patch of brilliant light until it disappeared\nbehind a projecting bosquet.\n\nHis Eminence had been exceedingly thoughtful.\n\n\"Know you aught of this, my lord?\" he asked of Lord Everingham, who also\nseemed wrapped in meditation.\n\n\"I suspect something of it,\" replied the young man slowly. \"There is a\nstory afloat--gossip, I thought it--that one of the Queen's\nmaids-of-honour has been playing some curious pranks at night .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and\nin disguise. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Indeed? Know you who the lady is?\"\n\n\"No! nor can I even guess. All the maids-of-honour are young and full of\nfun, and no doubt the girlish pranks were harmless enough, but Her\nMajesty is very austere and rigidly stern where questions of decorum are\nconcerned.\"\n\n\"So the Duchess of Lincoln, like a watchful dragon, would catch the fair\nmiscreant _in flagrante delicto_, eh?\" continued His Eminence.\n\nMechanically he turned to walk along the path recently followed by the\nnight watchman. His Eminence would have scorned the idea of any\nsuperstition influencing his precise, calculating mind, but,\nnevertheless, he had a strange belief in the guiding hand of Chance, and\nsomehow at the present moment he had an unaccountable presentiment, that\nthis gossip anent some young girl's frolic would in some way exercise an\ninfluence on his present schemes.\n\nAs if in immediate answer to these very thoughts a woman's frightened\nscream was suddenly heard close by, followed by muttered curses in the\nwatchman's gruff voice.\n\n\"What was that?\" exclaimed Everingham involuntarily.\n\n\"The lady _in flagrante delicto_, meseems,\" rejoined the Cardinal\nquietly.\n\nAnd both men began to walk more rapidly in the direction whence had come\nthe woman's scream. The next few moments brought them upon the scene,\nand soon in the gloom they distinguished the figure of the old watchman\napparently struggling with a woman, whose head and shoulders were\nenveloped in some sort of veil or hood. The lanthorn, evidently\nviolently thrown on the ground, had rolled down the path some little\ndistance from this group.\n\nThe woman was making obvious and frantic efforts to get away, whilst the\nold watchman exerted all his strength to keep tight hold of her wrists.\n\n\"What is it to thee, man, what I am doing here?\" the woman gasped in the\nmidst of her struggles. \"Let me go, I say!\"\n\nShe was evidently not very strong, for the old watchman, shrivelled and\nshrunken though he was, had already mastered her. She had lost her\nbalance, and was soon down on her knees. With a vigorous wrench the man\ncontrived to force her arms behind her back; he held them there with one\nhand, and with the other was groping in his wallet for a length of rope.\n\n\"Not before thou hast given a good account of thyself before the Duchess\nof Lincoln, my wench!\" he said, as he threw the rope round her shoulders\nand very dexterously contrived to pinion her arms behind her.\n\n\"Her Grace?\" she murmured contemptuously. \"I have naught to do with Her\nGrace. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Let me go, man; thou hast no right to tie me thus.\"\n\n\"Now then, my girl, get up, will ye? and come along quietly with me.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I'll not hurt ye .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. if ye come along quietly.\"\n\nThe man helped her to struggle to her feet. Her veil or cloak had\nevidently fallen from her head, for the Cardinal and Lord Everingham,\nwho were silently, and with no small measure of curiosity, watching the\nstrange spectacle, caught the glint of a woman's face and of bright\ngolden hair.\n\nThe watchman was trying to lead her away towards the Palace.\n\n\"Let me go, I tell thee,\" muttered the girl with persistent obstinacy.\n\"I have important business here, and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nBut the old man laughed derisively.\n\n\"Important business? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and prithee with whom, wench?\"\n\n\"With the Duke of Wessex .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" she retorted after a slight hesitation,\n\"There! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. now wilt let me go?\"\n\nBut the watchman laughed more immoderately than before.\n\n\"Oho! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. ho! ho! ho! that's a likely tale, my wench, there's many a\nyoung woman has business with His Grace, I'll warrant. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. But thou'st\nbest tell that tale to the Duchess of Lincoln first. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Business with\nthe Duke of Wessex .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. ha! ha! ha! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" here interposed a gentle, very urbane voice, \"meseems thy\nzeal somewhat outruns thy discretion. If this child has indeed business\nwith the Duke of Wessex, His Grace might prefer that thou shouldst keep\na quieter tongue in thy head.\"\n\nThe Cardinal, at sound of the Duke's name, had gradually drawn nearer to\nthe group. Lord Everingham, impelled by the same natural curiosity, had\nfollowed him.\n\n\"You would wish to speak with His Grace, child?\" continued His Eminence\nwith that same gentle benevolence which inspired an infinity of\nconfidence in the unwary. \"Do you know him?\"\n\nThe watchman, astonished, abashed, very highly perplexed at this\nunexpected interference, was rendered absolutely speechless. The girl\nhad turned defiantly on her new interlocutor, whose outline she could\nbut vaguely distinguish in the darkness.\n\n\"What's it to you?\" she retorted with obvious suspicion and mistrust.\n\n\"Not much I own,\" replied the Cardinal with imperturbable kindliness; \"I\nonly thought that being alone and perhaps frightened you would be glad\nof some help.\"\n\n\"Your Eminence .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" stammered the watchman, who was trying to recover\nhis speech.\n\n\"Silence!\" commanded His Eminence. \"I wish to speak with this young\nwoman alone.\"\n\nThe worthy watchman had naught to do but to obey. There was no\nquestioning an order given by so great a lord as the Cardinal de Moreno\nhimself. The good man discreetly withdrew, His Eminence quietly waiting\nuntil he was out of earshot.\n\n\"Now, child, have no fear,\" said the Cardinal gently. \"Tell me .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you\nwish to speak with the Duke of Wessex?\"\n\nShe turned resolutely towards him.\n\n\"You'll take me to him?\" she asked.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" he replied.\n\nA great struggle must have been raging within her. Even through the\ngloom His Eminence could see her shoulders and breast working\nconvulsively, whilst her breath came and went in quick, feverish gasps.\n\n\"I have been watching in the gardens at night,\" she murmured at last;\n\"for he is a great lord, and I dared not approach him by day. He saved\nmy life .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and I can read the stars. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I see that a great danger\nthreatens him. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\n\n\"Oh! I must warn him,\" she added in a sudden outburst of passionate\nvehemence. \"I must go to him .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I must.\"\n\nLord Everingham tried to interpose, but His Eminence restrained him with\na quick touch upon his arm. The Cardinal's hands were beautiful, white\nand caressing as those of a woman, delicately scented and be-ringed. He\npassed them gently over the girl's head, whilst he whispered softly--\n\n\"So you shall, child .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. so you shall. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Then, tell me .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. His\nGrace saved your life, you say? and you are very grateful to him, of\ncourse .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. more than that, perhaps .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you love him very dearly, eh?\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"What's that to you?\" retorted the girl sullenly.\n\nLord Everingham once more made as if he would interrupt this curious\ninterrogatory. His loyalty to his friend rebelled against this prying\ninto matters which might prove unpleasant for Wessex.\n\nThat the girl was no Court lady out on some mad frolic was patent\nenough, whilst the passionate ring of her voice, when she mentioned the\nDuke's name, proved very clearly that she had seen him, and seeing him\nhad perhaps learnt to love him.\n\nWho knows? Some secret intrigue, not altogether avowable, might lie at\nthe bottom of this strange adventure. Everingham's heart misgave him at\nthe thought that Wessex' most open enemy should perhaps learn a secret\nhitherto kept from all his friends.\n\nThe girl, on the other hand, seemed willing to trust the Cardinal. She\nrepeated doggedly once or twice--\n\n\"You'll take me to him? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. at once? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"If I can,\" replied His Eminence, still very protecting, very suave and\nkind, \"but not just now. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. His Grace is with the Queen .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you are\ntoo sensible and earnest, I feel sure, to wish to intrude upon him.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. But will you not trust me a little while? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and I promise you\nthat you shall see him.\"\n\n\"Nay! I've nothing to lose by trusting you or any one,\" she replied. \"If\nyou do not take me to him, I'll find my way alone.\"\n\n\"Come, that's brave independence. But, child, if I am to help you with\nHis Grace of Wessex, I must at least know who you are.\"\n\n\"They call me Mirrab.\"\n\nAt sound of the name Everingham started. One or two vague recollections,\nin connection with the soothsayer of East Molesey Fair, seemed to be\nchasing one another in his mind, but he could not give them definite\nshape.\n\nA strange feeling, made up of uneasiness and shame, coupled with\nexcitement and intense curiosity, caused him to go and pick up the\nwatchman's lanthorn, which lay on the ground close by.\n\nWhen he was near the girl again he held it up, and the light fell full\non her face.\n\nThen he remembered.\n\nIt was Mirrab, the necromancer, the kitchen wench, used by a vulgar\ntrickster to hoodwink some gullible burgesses and their dames at the\nvillage fair, but whom Nature had, in one of her unaccountable freaks,\nendowed with the same golden hair, the same exquisite features, the same\ndeep and wonderful eyes, as the most beautiful woman at Mary Tudor's\ncourt, the Lady Ursula Glynde.\n\nThe veil which usually enveloped Mirrab's head had fallen round her\nshoulders; her dress was of coarse woollen stuff, open at the neck and\nshort in the sleeves; the arms and hands, rough and clumsy in shape,\nbetrayed the girl's humble origin, and the likeness to Lady Ursula was\nconfined to the face and hair. But it was there, nevertheless; quite\nunmistakable, even bewildering to the two men who were gazing,\nspeechless, at this strange spectacle.\n\nThen Everingham put down the lanthorn. He dared not look at the\nCardinal, half fearing, perhaps, that the wild thoughts and schemes\nwhich had suddenly arisen in his mind at sight of this extraordinary\nfreak of nature should have already found more definite shape in His\nEminence's astute and far-seeing brain.\n\nStrangely enough, at this moment, the practised diplomatist, the wily\nand unscrupulous Spaniard, met the more simple-souled Englishman on\ncommon ground, and at once felt sure of his co-operation.\n\nBoth had the same end in view: a desire to break up any relationship\nwhich may have sprung up between the Duke of Wessex and the beautiful\nyoung girl, of whom this otherwise coarse wench was the perfect physical\ncounterpart. But the Spaniard was the quicker in thought and in action.\nWhilst Everingham still vaguely wondered how the extraordinary\nresemblance might be utilized to gain that great end which he had in\nview, the Cardinal had already formed and matured a plan.\n\nHe took the veil from Mirrab's shoulders and once more drew it over her\nhead. Then he undid the clumsy knot with which the watchman had pinioned\nher hands. Mirrab remained perfectly passive the while; she seemed under\nthe magic spell of the soft, velvety hands, which had, as it were, taken\npossession of her person.\n\nThe two men had not exchanged one word since the light of the lanthorn\nhad revealed the strange secret to them; they seemed to be acting in\nperfect accord. There was no longer any need for protestation of outward\nfriendship, or for cementing the compact of temporary alliance.\n\nEveringham once more picked up the lanthorn and went in search of the\nwatchman, in order to dismiss him with a word of command and to ensure\nhis silence with a threat and a few silver coins. The man, of course,\nknew nothing of the importance of the event which he had unwittingly\nbrought about. He may have vaguely wondered in his mind why His Eminence\nthe Spanish Cardinal should take such a keen interest in a female\nvagrant, found trespassing on royal ground. But the few pieces of silver\ngiven to him by the noble lord, soon silenced even this transitory\nastonishment.\n\nStolidly he resumed his nightly round, satisfied that he need no longer\nlook for lurking thieves in the park.\n\nWhen Everingham, having seen the last of the watchman, returned to the\nspot where he had left His Eminence and Mirrab, he found that both had\ndisappeared.\n\n\n\n\nPART III\n\nA GAME OF CHESS\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTHE PAWNS\n\n\nThe evening banquet had been anything but gay.\n\nThe Queen, as was oft her wont, had hardly said a word. The Cardinal de\nMoreno looked thoughtful and His Grace of Wessex was singularly silent.\n\nDirectly after supper Her Majesty retired to her own apartments,\naccompanied by her ladies, leaving behind her that desultory atmosphere\nof dull and purposeless conversation, which hangs round a supper table\nin the absence of the fair sex.\n\nThe brilliant assembly broke up into small groups. The Earl of Pembroke\nand two or three other lords were leaving for Scotland towards midnight;\ntheir friends gathered round them to bid them God-speed. In the deep\nembrasure of the great bay His Grace of Wessex was in earnest conference\nwith Lord Winchester and Sir William Drury, whilst at one end of the\nlong centre table half a dozen young gallants were idling over a game of\nhazard.\n\nBut there was a feeling of obsession in the air--a sense as if something\nmomentous was about to happen. Whispered rumours, more or less\nconflicting, were afloat, yet nothing definite was known. On the other\nhand, idle, far-stretched gossip was rife and was even growing in\nextravagance as the evening wore on.\n\nNo one had been present on the terrace to witness the little incident\nwhich occurred there earlier in the afternoon save the three\ndistinguished actors in the brief comedy scene. Obviously from them\nnothing could be gleaned. The Queen and the Cardinal would not be like\nto enlighten the curious, whilst the Duke of Wessex, at all times\nreserved and unapproachable, could not be asked to give his version of\nthe event.\n\nThe foreign envoys had very soon followed the example set by Her Majesty\nand withdrawn from the circle, which seemed more hostile to them than\nusual to-night. The Cardinal de Moreno and the Marquis de Suarez were\nthe first to go. They occupied the magnificent suite of chambers wherein\nill-fated Wolsey had lived, schemed, and fallen. The more sumptuous\nseries of rooms beyond--those built with lavish extravagance by King\nHenry VIII for his own personal use--had been placed at the disposal of\nHis Grace of Wessex and his numerous retinue.\n\nBetween the Duke's apartments and those allotted to the envoys of the\nKing of Spain was the fine audience chamber, used by the Queen herself\nor by her more distinguished guests for the reception of important\nvisitors. It was here that Lord Everingham, anxious, perturbed, vaguely\nashamed of his own actions, had sought out the Cardinal de Moreno after\nthe banquet and begged for an interview.\n\nHis Eminence, suave, urbane, a veritable mirror of benevolence, had\nreceived him with a smile of welcome on his lips and a wealth of kindly\nreproach in his eyes.\n\n\"Ah, my lord!\" he said to the young man, as soon as the servants had\nwithdrawn, \"Nature, I fear me, hath not intended you for a diplomatist.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"This interview to-night, with me--was it necessary?\"\n\n\"I could not rest,\" said Everingham impulsively, \"until----\"\n\n\"Until you had proclaimed it to the entire Court in general, and to His\nGrace of Wessex in particular, that you had a secret understanding with\nhis political rival, the Spanish ambassador,\" rejoined His Eminence\ndrily.\n\n\"An interview .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Have you ever honoured me thus before, my lord?--you or any of your\nfriends?\"\n\n\"No .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. perhaps not .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I only requested a brief _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"And had I refused that dangerous _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_, what would you have\ndone?\"\n\n\"Demanded it,\" replied Everingham hotly. \"I must know what has happened,\nand what you intend to do.\"\n\nHis Eminence threw a quick look at the young man, a look half of pity,\nhalf of contempt. For a moment it seemed as if an angry retort hovered\nupon his lips. But he merely shrugged his shoulders and said blandly--\n\n\"You are very expert at the game of chess, my lord, so they tell me.\"\n\n\"I have played it a great many times,\" rejoined Everingham, a little\nastonished at the sudden transition.\n\n\"Ah! and have become very proficient, I understand. Will you honour me\nby playing a game with me?\"\n\n\"Now?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"The lateness of the hour .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I start for Scotland almost directly.\"\n\n\"Yet in spite of these difficulties you sought a casual interview with\nan avowed political enemy.\"\n\n\"No one need know .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" stammered the young man, slightly abashed.\n\n\"Every one inside this Palace knows by now that my lord of Everingham,\nthe intimate friend at His Grace of Wessex, is closeted alone with the\nenvoy of His Majesty the King of Spain,\" rejoined His Eminence with\nslow emphasis. \"Believe me, my lord, a game of chess is the wisest\ncourse.\"\n\n\"Will you tell me first .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"I can tell your lordship nothing, except across the chess board.\"\n\n\"Well! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. since you wish it .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"My wishes have naught to do with this matter. I was following the most\nelementary dictates of prudence.\"\n\nHe touched the handbell and rang. A liveried servant appeared.\n\n\"Had I not told thee, sirrah,\" said His Eminence, \"that my lord\nEveringham had kindly consented to give me my _revanche_ at chess ere he\ndeparted? How is it that the board has not been prepared?\"\n\n\"I crave Your Eminence's most humble pardon,\" protested the man in\nconfusion. \"I had not understood .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Not understood?\" laughed the Cardinal good-naturedly. \"Marry! the knave\ndoth impugn my knowledge of the English tongue.\"\n\n\"I would not presume, Your Eminence .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Tush, man! hold thy tongue and repair thy negligence. Where's the\nboard? His lordship hath but an hour to spare.\"\n\nEveringham watched with ill-concealed impatience the elaborate\npreparations made for the game. He thought it quite unnecessary, and had\nhe dared he would have refused to join in the senseless deception. But\nin this matter he had ceased to trust his own judgment, and, much\nagainst his will, was allowing the Cardinal to take the lead. He felt\nout of his own intellectual depths in this slough of intrigue wherein he\nhad so impulsively ventured, and out of which he now felt incapable of\nextricating himself.\n\nSimple-minded and loyal to the core, he had a horror of any treachery\nagainst his friend. No other consideration would ever have prompted him\nto join in an underhand scheme with the Spanish Cardinal, save his own\nearnest faith in the ultimate good which would accrue therefrom, both to\nthe country at large and to Wessex himself. With his whole heart and\nsoul he believed that, at this moment, the Duke's marriage with Lady\nUrsula Glynde would be nothing short of a national calamity.\n\nReluctantly, he sat down to the board at last. His Eminence, opposite to\nhim, was shading his face with his delicate white hand, and at first\nseemed absorbed in the intricacies of the game. Two servitors were still\nbusy about the room. One of them asked if His Eminence would desire more\nlight.\n\nBut the Cardinal preferred the fitful flicker of a few wax tapers. He\nliked the fantastic shadows which left the greater part of the vast\nchamber in gloom. Lord Everingham was a noted and very proficient\nplayer; His Eminence was enjoying the game thoroughly.\n\n\"Check to your king, my lord Cardinal,\" said the young Englishman at\nlast.\n\n\"Only a temporary check, you see, my lord,\" rejoined His Eminence, as\nwith slender, tapering fingers he moved one of the ivory pieces on the\nboard. \"By the help of this one little pawn, the safety of the whole\ncombination is assured, and 'tis your knight now which is in serious\ndanger.\"\n\n\"Not serious, I think, Your Eminence, and once more check to your king.\"\n\nEven as he spoke the two servitors finally left the room, closing the\nheavy doors noiselessly behind them.\n\n\"Oh!\" said the Cardinal thoughtfully, \"this will necessitate a bolder\nmove on my part. You mark, my son,\" he added as soon as he had made a\nmove, \"how beautifully Nature herself plays into our hands: you and I\ndesired to part His Grace of Wessex effectually and for ever from his\nbeautiful affianced bride. Two hours ago this seemed impossible, and\nlo!--a girl comes across our path: low-born, brainless, probably a\nwanton, yet the very physical counterpart of virtuous Lady Ursula,\nand----\"\n\n\"Check,\" said Everingham drily, as he moved his castle.\n\n\"Nay! nay! we'll once more move this little pawn,\" rejoined His\nEminence, with his usual pleasant benevolence, \"and see how simple the\nplan becomes.\"\n\n\"'Tis of that plan I longed to hear.\"\n\n\"So you shall, my son, so you shall,\" said the Cardinal very kindly.\n\"What would you wish to know?\"\n\n\"The girl Mirrab?--Where is she?\"\n\n\"In Don Miguel de Suarez rooms, dressing herself in quaint finery,\ncollected for the purpose by my faithful servant Pasquale, who has a\nvaluable female friend in the Queen's own entourage. A silk kirtle, rich\nwhite robes, some fantastic ornaments for the hair, and the likeness\n'twixt our Mirrab and the high-born Lady Ursula will be more strangely\napparent than ever. Your turn to move, my lord. I pray you do not lose\nthe thread of this interesting game.\"\n\n\"'Tis easy enough to lose oneself in the mazes of Your Eminence's\ndiplomacy,\" quoth the young man anxiously. \"Having dressed the girl up\nin all that finery, what do you propose to do?\"\n\nHis Eminence was silent for awhile; he seemed absorbed in an elaborate\nstrategical combination, directed against his opponent's king. Then he\nmoved his queen right across the board and said quietly--\n\n\"What do I propose to do, my lord? Only, with the aid of that diplomacy\nwhich you English affect to despise, contrive that His Grace of Wessex\nshould see a lady--whom he will naturally mistake for the Lady Ursula\nGlynde--in a highly compromising situation, and the love idyll begun\nthis afternoon will abruptly end to-night.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"Ah, my lord! surely we must trust Chance a little. The fickle jade has\nserved us well already.\"\n\n\"I'll not allow a pure woman's reputation to be sullied by any dastardly\ntrick .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" began Everingham hotly.\n\n\"Pray, my lord, what is your definition of a dastardly trick?\" rejoined\nHis Eminence suavely. \"Is it the use made by a political opponent of\nevery means, fair or foul, to accomplish his own aims, which he\nconsiders great and just? or is it the work of a friend--an intimate,\nconfidential friend--joining issue for the like purpose? Nay, nay!\nunderstand me, my dear lord,\" he added, with an infinity of gentle\nkindliness expressed in the almost paternal tone of his voice, \"'twas\nnot I, remember, who ever thought to blame you. Your aims and ambitions\nare as selfless as mine own: for the moment our purpose is the same.\nWill you honour me by allowing me to show you the way of attaining that\npurpose, quickly and surely? I'll not ask you to lend me a hand. I would\ngladly have kept from you the knowledge of my own intricate diplomacy.\nWhy should you fear for the Lady Ursula? Is her reputation in your eyes\nof greater moment than the success of your schemes?--yours and all your\nfaction, remember.\"\n\n\"Ah! there you have me, my lord,\" rejoined Everingham with a sigh. \"All\nEngland is at one with us in a burning desire to see Wessex wedded to\nour Queen. But this is where your diplomacy escapes me. Once Wessex is\nturned away from the Lady Ursula, he will, we hope, naturally turn to\nthe Queen, who loves him passionately, and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Check!\" he added,\nmoving one of his pieces.\n\n\"Ah! you press me hard. Your lordship is a skilful player,\" said the\nCardinal, intently studying the board. \"As for me, you see I seem to\nmove my pawns somewhat aimlessly. For the moment, I wish to part His\nGrace of Wessex from Lady Ursula .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. after that--we shall see.\"\n\nEveringham was silent. A truly bitter conflict was raging in his simple\nheart. Loyalty to his friend, love for his country, and an overwhelming\nanxiety for its welfare, cried out loudly within him. The very thought\nof meeting Wessex face to face at this moment was terrible to him, and\nyet he would not undo what he had already done, and would not thwart the\nSpaniard's tortuous schemes by betraying them to the Duke.\n\nThe purpose which he had in view blinded him to everything save the hope\nof its ultimate achievement. At this moment he felt that, if Wessex\nshared Mary Tudor's throne with her, so much that was great and good\nwould come to England thereby, that all petty considerations of\ntemporary disloyalty, or the reputation of one innocent woman, would\nquickly vanish into insignificance.\n\nThe very feelings of remorse and of shame which he was experiencing at\nthis moment strengthened him in his faith, for he was suffering keenly\nand acutely to the very depths of his honest heart, and he imagined that\nhe was earning a crown of martyrdom thereby; he believed that by\ntrampling on his own prejudices and jeopardizing his friendship with the\nman he loved and honoured best in all the world, he was adding to the\ncause, which he held to be sacred, the additional lustre of\nself-sacrifice.\n\nHis Eminence no doubt knew all this. With his intimate knowledge of the\nfoibles of mankind, he found it an easy task enough to probe the inner\nthoughts of the transparent soul before him. He divined the young man's\ndoubts and fears, the battle waged within him betwixt an abstruse\npolitical aim and his own upright nature. The game was continued in\nsilence, Everingham's state of mind being revealed in the one bitter\nsigh--\n\n\"Ah! I go away with a heavy heart, feeling that I have helped to commit\na treachery.\"\n\nThe Cardinal looked benevolently compassionate. At heart he was more\nthan glad to think that this blundering Englishman would be well out of\nthe way. Could he have foreseen the marvellous turn by which Fate meant\nto aid him in his intrigue, he would never have made overtures to so\nclumsy an ally as Lord Everingham. But at the time he had been driven\ninto a corner through the furious jealousy of the Queen, who had\nwell-nigh staggered him.\n\nHis Eminence then did not know how to act. For the first time in his\nlife he had been completely outwitted by the events which he himself had\nhelped to bring about. They had shaped themselves in exact opposition to\nhis keenest expectations. How to part Wessex from Lady Ursula, with whom\nhis volatile Grace was probably by then more than half in love, became\nan almost insolvable problem.\n\nThe Queen's ultimatum was almost a fiat. His Eminence saw himself and\nhis retinue ignominiously quitting the English Court and\nreturning--baffled, vanquished, humbled--to the throne of an infuriated\nmonarch, who never forgave and always knew how to punish.\n\nIn despair the Cardinal had turned to an ally. He knew that His Grace\nwas quite inaccessible. Towards all the foreign ambassadors the Duke of\nWessex was always ensconced behind a barrier of unbendable hauteur and\nof frigid reserve. It would have been impossible to attack the lady of\nhis choice openly, and in offering his own help to Everingham His\nEminence vaguely hoped to arrive at some half-hidden mystery, a secret\nperhaps in His Grace's life which would have helped him to strike in the\ndark.\n\nThen Fate interposed: exactly ten minutes too late, and when the\nCardinal had already saddled himself with an over-scrupulous,\nvacillating, ultra-honest ally. He could not now throw him over without\nendangering the success of his own schemes, and therefore brought all\nhis powers of dissimulation into play to effectually hide the impatience\nwhich he felt.\n\nThe entrance of Don Miguel, Marquis de Suarez, created a diversion.\n\n\"Ah, my dear Marquis,\" said His Eminence, with a sigh of relief, \"your\narrival is most opportune. I pray you help me to persuade Lord\nEveringham that we are not scheming black treachery against His Grace of\nWessex.\"\n\nDon Miguel came forward, a smile of the keenest satisfaction upon his\nlips.\n\n\"Why treachery?\" he said lightly.\n\nBut Everingham, having heard all that there was to know, was now in a\nhurry to depart. Having made up his mind to go through with his purpose\nto the end, he had but one wish--to turn his back upon the events which\nhe had helped to bring about, and let them take their course.\n\nWith it all he felt a keen antipathy for these two plotters who had\ndrawn him into their net. Whilst acting in concert with these Spaniards,\nhe had an overwhelming desire to insult them or throw his contempt in\ntheir smooth, clever faces.\n\n\"Check and mate, my lord Cardinal,\" he said drily, as he took advantage\nof His Eminence's absence of mind to bring the game to a successful\nclose. Then he rose to go. He was already booted and spurred for his\njourney northwards, and had unhitched his sword-belt when settling down\nto play. Whilst he was buckling it on again, Don Miguel approached him.\n\n\"I entreat you, milor, do not talk of treachery,\" said the young\nSpaniard earnestly. \"Believe me that in this matter, your conscience is\nover-sensitive. After all, what does His Eminence propose? Only this,\nthat for a little while--a few days only perhaps--His Grace of Wessex\nshould be led to believe, through the testimony of his own eyes, that\nthe Lady Ursula Glynde is not altogether worthy to become Duchess of\nWessex. The wench Mirrab will play her part unconsciously, and therefore\nto perfection. No one but His Grace shall be witness of the scene which\nwe propose to enact, and though his disenchantment will be complete, do\nyou think that he will greatly suffer thereby? Surely you do not imagine\nthat he has fallen seriously in love with Lady Ursula in one hour: his\nown amour-propre will suffer a very transitory pang _et tout sera dit_.\"\n\n\"The Duke of Wessex will never break his heart or quarrel with a friend\nfor the sake of a woman,\" added the Cardinal in his smooth, gentle\nvoice.\n\n\"Like the bee, His Grace lingers over a flower only whilst he finds the\nperfume sweet,\" continued Don Miguel. \"If he thinks the Lady Ursula\nfalse, he will turn to some other pretty maid with an indulgent smile\nfor woman's frailty.\"\n\nAll this sounded plausible enough, and Lord Everingham, at war with his\nown conscience, was only too willing to be persuaded that he was in no\nway wronging his friend. One scruple, however, still held him back and\nwould not be denied.\n\n\"There is one person in all this, my lord Marquis,\" he said, \"whom I\nnotice you and His Eminence scarce trouble to think about.\"\n\n\"Who is that, milor?\"\n\n\"The Lady Ursula Glynde!\"\n\n\"Bah! What of her?\"\n\n\"A girl's reputation, my lord, is in England held to be sacred.\"\n\n\"Why should her reputation suffer? Who will gossip of this affair? You?\nI'll not believe it! His Grace of Wessex?--perish the thought. Nay! to\nsatisfy that over-sensitive conscience of yours, milor, may I remind\nyou that you are not pledged to secrecy. If on your return from Scotland\nyou find that the Lady Ursula's reputation has suffered in any way\nthrough the little scheme which we purpose, you will be at liberty to\nright the innocent and to confound the guilty. Is that not so, Your\nEminence?\"\n\n\"You have said it, my son,\" replied the Cardinal.\n\n\"Well, are you satisfied, milor?\" queried Don Miguel, who at an\nimpatient sign from the Cardinal was courteously leading Everingham\ntowards the door.\n\n\"I feel somewhat easier in my mind, perhaps,\" responded the young man.\n\"I dare admit that His Eminence and yourself are more right in your\nsurmises than I am. But I have the honour of calling His Grace of Wessex\nmy friend, and I have an earnest wish in my heart that I could stay\nanother twenty-four hours here, to see that no grievous harm come to him\nfrom all this.\"\n\nWith a heavy sigh he finally took up his cloak and bade adieu to the two\nSpaniards.\n\nDon Miguel escorted him as far as the cloisters, until a servitor took\ncharge of his lordship. Then he turned back to the audience chamber,\nwhere he found His Eminence sitting placidly in a high-backed arm-chair.\n\n\"Marry! this was the most unprofitable half-hour I have ever spent in my\nlife,\" quoth the Cardinal with a half-smothered yawn, and speaking in\nhis own native tongue. \"These English are indeed impossible with their\nscruples and their conscience, their friendships and their prejudices.\nCarramba! what would become of Europe if such follies had to be pandered\nto?\"\n\n\"By the Mass! 'tis a mighty lucky chance which hath sent that blundering\nyoung fool to the frozen kingdom of Scotland to-night,\" rejoined Don\nMiguel with a laugh.\n\n\"Chance, my son, is an obedient slave and a cruel mistress. Let us yoke\nher to our war-chariot whilst she seems amenable to our schemes. I'll\nnow retire to chapel and read my breviary there until Her Majesty hath\nneed of me for her evening orisons. Her curiosity will not allow her to\ndispense with my services to-night, though she showed me the cold\nshoulder throughout the banquet. There's a good deal which devolves upon\nyou, my son. Seek out His Grace of Wessex as soon as you can for the\nspecial interview which we have planned. I pray you be light-hearted and\nnatural. It should not be a difficult task for Don Miguel de Suarez to\nplay the part of a young and callous reprobate. I, the while, will watch\nmy opportunity, and will have our dramatic little scene well in\nrehearsal by the time the Duke retires to his own apartments. He must\ncross this audience chamber to reach them. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. There shall be no\ngarish light .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. only an open window and the moon if she will favour\nus. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. One short glimpse at the wench shall be sufficient. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I\nwill contrive that it be brief but decisive. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Your talk with His\nGrace will have paved the way. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I will contrive .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Chance will\naid me, but I _will_ contrive.\"\n\nThe voice was changed. It was no longer suave now, but harsh and\ndetermined, cruel too in its slow, cold monotones. His Eminence paused\nawhile, then said more quietly--\n\n\"What is the wench doing now?\"\n\n\"Gazing in rapt admiration at her own face in the mirror,\" replied Don\nMiguel lightly, \"and incessantly talking of the Duke of Wessex, whom she\nvows she will see before the dawn. She mutters a good deal about the\nstars, and some danger which she says threatens her dear lord. Ha! ha!\nha!\"\n\nHis laugh sounded hoarse and bitter, and there was a glimmer of hatred\nin his deep-set, dark Spanish eyes. There was obviously no love lost\nhere 'twixt His Grace and these schemers, for His Eminence's bland\nunctuousness looked just now as dangerous as the younger man's hate.\n\n\"Does she talk intelligently?\" asked the Cardinal.\n\n\"Intelligently? No!\" quoth Don Miguel. \"Awhile ago she talked\nintelligibly enough, but three bumpers of heavy Spanish wine have addled\nher feeble wits by now. I doubt me but the wench was always half crazed.\nI thought so when I saw her in that booth, covered with tinsel and\nuttering ridiculous incantations.\"\n\n\"She might prove dangerous too,\" remarked His Eminence softly.\n\n\"To the man who thwarted her--yes!\"\n\n\"Then, if His Grace should find out the deception, and, mayhap, were\nnone too lenient with her, she would .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHe did not complete the sentence, and after a moment or two said\nblandly--\n\n\"In either case, meseems, chance is bound to favour us. Our good\nPasquale shall see that the wench is provided with a short dagger, eh?\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. of English make .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and with unerring and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. poisoned blade.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. What? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nThere was silence between the two men after that. The thought which now\nreigned in both their minds was too dark to be put into more precise\nwords.\n\nDon Miguel took up a cloak, which was lying on a chair, and wrapped it\nround him. His Eminence drew a breviary from his pocket and settled\nhimself more comfortably in the high-backed chair. Don Miguel turned to\ngo, but at the door he paused and came back close to where the Cardinal\nwas sitting. Then he said quietly--\n\n\"Is Your Eminence prepared for _that_ eventuality too?\"\n\n\"We must always be prepared for any eventuality, my son,\" replied the\nCardinal gently.\n\nThen he became absorbed in his breviary, whilst Don Miguel slowly\nstrolled out of the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nDEPARTURE\n\n\nEveringham could not leave the Palace without bidding farewell to\nWessex. For the first time in his life he wished to avoid his friend,\nyet feared to arouse suspicion, mistrust--what not? in the heart of the\nman whom he was so unwillingly helping to deceive. He half feared now\nthe frank and searching eyes which had always rested on him with\npeculiar kindness and friendship; he almost dreaded having to grasp the\nslender, aristocratic hand, which had ever been extended to him in\nloyalty and truth.\n\nNevertheless in his heart there was no desire to draw back. During his\nlengthy colloquy with His Eminence he had weighed all the consequences\nof his own actions; though misguided perhaps as to the means, led away\nby a stronger will than his own, his purpose was pure and his aim high;\nand though he had tortured his brain with conjectures and fears, he\ncould not see any danger to Wessex in the intrigue devised against him.\n\nAs for Lady Ursula, he swore to himself that no harm should ultimately\ncome to her. She would be a tool, a necessary pawn in this game of\ncross-purposes, which had the freedom and greatness of England for its\nultimate aim.\n\nWith a firm step Everingham reached the Great Hall, where one by one the\ncompany was slowly dispersing. The Earl of Pembroke had gone to his\nrooms to prepare for the journey; his friends were ready in the\nFountain Court to bid him a final farewell. Some of the younger men\nwere still whispering in groups in various parts of the hall, whilst\nothers were continuing their game of hazard.\n\nEveringham took a rapid look round. There, in the embrasure on the dais,\nWessex was conversing with the Earl of Oxford, whilst faithful Harry\nPlantagenet lay calmly sleeping at his feet. The Duke's grave face\nlighted up at sight of his friend.\n\n\"I thought I should have missed you,\" he said, grasping the young man\nwarmly by the hand. \"My lord of Oxford was just telling me that he\nthought you would be starting anon.\"\n\n\"Should I have gone without your God-speed?\"\n\n\"I trust not indeed. But your game of chess, meseems, must have been\nvery engrossing.\"\n\nLord Everingham felt himself changing colour. Fortunately his back was\nto the light, and the Duke could not have seen the slight start of alarm\nwhich followed his simple remark. In a flash Everingham had realized how\ntrue had been His Eminence's conjecture. Wessex had already heard of the\ninterview in the audience chamber. The game of chess had undoubtedly\nproved a useful explanation for so unusual an incident.\n\n\"Oh! His Eminence is passionately fond of the game,\" rejoined Everingham\nas lightly as he could, \"and I could not help but accede to his request\nfor a final battle of skill with him, since probably I may not see him\non my return.\"\n\nBut he felt His Grace's earnest eyes fixed searchingly upon him. A wild\nlonging seized him to throw off the mantle of diplomacy, which became\nhim so ill, and to give a word of timely warning to his friend. The\nsight of the beautiful boarhound, so faithful, so watchful, at the feet\nof his master, became almost intolerable to his overwrought mind.\nPerhaps he would have spoken even now, at this eleventh hour, when from\nthe court outside there came the sharp sound of bugle-call.\n\nHarry Plantagenet, roused from his light sleep, had pricked his ears.\n\n\"I fear me 'tis to horse, friend,\" said Wessex, with a light tone of\nsadness, \"Marry! it likes me not to see you depart. Harry Plantagenet\nand I will miss you sorely in this dull place, and I will miss your\nloyal hand amongst so many enemies.\"\n\n\"Enemies, my dear lord!\" protested Everingham warmly. \"Look around this\nGreat Hall at this moment. Now that the foreign ambassadors have\ndeparted, do you see aught but friends? Nay more, adherents, partisans,\nfaithful subjects, an you choose,\" he added significantly.\n\n\"Friends to-day,\" mused His Grace, \"enemies perhaps to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Impossible.\"\n\n\"Even if .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. But by the Lord Harry, this is no time to talk of my\naffairs,\" rejoined Wessex light-heartedly. \"Farewell, friends, and\nGod-speed. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Harry, make your bow to the most loyal man in\nEngland--you'll not see his like until he return from Scotland. In your\near, my dear lord, I pray you be not astonished if when that happy\neventuality occurs, you find me no longer a free man. Come, Harry, shall\nwe bid him adieu at the gates?\"\n\nHe linked his arm in that of Everingham, the group of gentlemen parted\nto let him pass, then closed behind him, and followed him and his friend\nout of the hall. Every one was glad of a diversion from the oppressive\natmosphere of the last few hours. Many murmured: \"God bless Your Grace!\"\nas he passed through the brilliant assembly exchanging a word, a merry\njest with his friends, a courteous bow or gracious smile with the casual\nacquaintances.\n\nHis popularity at this moment was at its height. Nothing would have\ncaused greater joy in England than the announcement of his plighted\ntroth to the Queen. Yet if these gentlemen, who so eagerly pressed round\nhim as he escorted his dearest friend through the hall, had been gifted\nwith the knowledge of their fellow-creature's innermost thoughts, they\nmight have read in His Grace's heart the opening chapters of a romance\nwhich would have changed their enthusiasm into bitter disappointment.\nThey would have seen that in that heart, wherein they hoped to see their\nQueen enthroned, there now reigned a dainty image, that of a young girl\ndressed in shimmering white, with ruddy golden hair falling loosely\nabout her shoulders, and deep, dark eyes, now blue, now grey, now\ninscrutably black, the mirrors of a pure, innocent, joyous soul within.\n\nAs for Everingham, all his desire to warn Wessex had vanished with the\nlatter's lightly spoken allusion to the incident of this afternoon. He\nwas now only conscious of a desire to get away, and thus leave events to\nshape their course according to the dictates of my lord Cardinal.\n\nEverything was ready for the departure. The gentlemen who composed the\nmission sent by Mary Tudor to the Queen Regent of Scotland were\nproceeding to Edinburgh by water. They would ride to Greenwich to-night,\nthen embark in the early dawn.\n\nThe horses were pawing the ground impatiently; every one had assembled\nin the Fountain Court, which presented an animated and picturesque\nspectacle, with the crowd of servants and the numerous retinue which was\nto accompany the Earl of Pembroke to Scotland. A number of torch-bearers\nlent fantastic aspect to the scene, for a lively breeze had sprung up,\nblowing the fitful flames hither and thither, bringing into bold relief\nnow the richly caparisoned steed of one of the noblemen, now the steel\nhelmets of the military escort, anon throwing everything into deep,\nimpenetrable shadow whilst touching with weird, red light some\ngrotesque vane or leaden waterspout on the walls of the Palace.\n\nThe Earl of Pembroke took a long farewell from His Grace of Wessex.\nHimself one of the most fervent adherents of the Duke, he was longing\nfor a word, a promise however vague, that the much-desired alliance\nwould indeed soon take place.\n\nWessex lingered some time beside Everingham. He seemed strangely loath\nto part from his fondest friend just now. The crowd around him were\nchattering merrily, the young men feeling the usual, natural\nexhilaration of manhood at sight of this goodly cavalcade, and the sound\nof clattering arms, the champing of bits, and quick, sharp calls to\nassemble.\n\nThen, at a given moment, one of the bays of King Henry's presence\nchamber was thrown open, and the Queen herself appeared at the window. A\nshout of welcome was raised, such as could only come from faithful and\nloyal hearts.\n\nMary was surrounded by some of her ladies. The strong light of the room\nwas behind her, so that she appeared as a silhouette, dignified, rather\nstiff in her corseted panier of rich brocade, her head slightly bent\nforward as if in anxious search of some one in the crowd.\n\n\"God bless our Queen,\" said the Duke of Wessex loudly, and the words\nwere taken up again and again by two hundred lusty throats, gentlemen\nand servants all alike, and the cry echoed against the massive walls of\nold Hampton Court like a solemn prayer.\n\nNot a few voices then added: \"God bless His Grace of Wessex!\" The Queen\nhad recognized the Duke's voice. When she heard this second cry, every\none noticed that she pressed her hand to her heart, as if overcome with\nemotion. Then she waved an adieu from the window and hastily retired\nwithin.\n\nThe signal for departure was given. A few belated gentlemen quickly\nsprang to the stirrup--Everingham being among the last. With a deafening\nnoise of clattering steel the military escort led the way, the halberds\ngleaming like tongues of flame in the torchlight as the men-at-arms\nlowered them in order to pass through the gates.\n\nThen followed the Earl of Pembroke with Lord Everingham by his side, and\nthe other gentlemen of the mission in close proximity. The retinue of\nservants and another detachment of men-at-arms completed the cort\u00c3\u00a8ge.\n\nSome of the younger men followed the cavalcade on foot through the gate\nand thence across the Base Court, even as far as the bridge and beyond.\nThe older ones, however, began to disperse. With a sigh, the Duke of\nWessex called to his dog, who had followed the exciting proceedings with\nthe keenest canine enthusiasm.\n\n\"Ah, Harry, old friend!\" he said with a tinge of sadness. \"Why did not\nProvidence fashion my Grace into some humbler personality? You and I\nwould have been the happier, methinks.\"\n\nHarry Plantagenet yawned ostentatiously in acquiescence, then he\nblinked, and seemed to say, as if in echo of his master's thoughts--\n\n\"Marry! but there are compensations, you know!\"\n\n\"Only since this afternoon!\" commented His Grace under his breath, as he\nfinally turned his steps in the direction of his own apartments.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nTHE BLACK KNIGHT\n\n\nAs the Duke of Wessex was crossing one of the large rooms of the wing\nwhich divides the old Fountain Court from the Cloister Green, he\nsuddenly heard himself called by name.\n\n\"Luck favours me indeed,\" said a voice from out the gloom. \"His Grace of\nWessex an I mistake not.\"\n\nAt this hour of the evening these rooms were usually deserted, and left\nbut dimly illumined by a few wax tapers placed in tall, many-armed\ncandelabra, the flickering light of which failed to penetrate into the\ndistant corners of the vast, panelled chambers. Wessex could only see\nthe dim outline of a man coming towards him.\n\n\"At your service, fair sir, whoever you may be,\" he responded lightly,\n\"but by the Mass! meseems you must claim kinship with the feline species\nto be able to distinguish my unworthy self in the dark.\"\n\n\"Nay! 'twas my wish which fathered my thoughts. I had hoped to meet Your\nGrace here, and was on the look out.\"\n\n\"The Marquis de Suarez,\" rejoined Wessex, as the young Spaniard now came\nwithin the circle of light projected by the candelabra. \"You wished to\nspeak with me, sir?\"\n\n\"I would claim this privilege of Your Grace's courtesy.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I am ever at your service,\" replied the Duke, not a little\nastonished at the request.\n\nSince his first meeting with Don Miguel at East Molesey Fair he had only\nexchanged a very few words with the Spaniard, and the latter seemed even\nto have purposely avoided him during the past few days. To this His\nGrace had paid no attention. The foreign envoys at present staying in\nthe Palace were exceedingly antipathetic to him, and beyond the social\namenities of Court life he had held no intercourse with any of them.\n\nRivals all of them, they nevertheless joined issue with one another in\ntheir hostile attitude towards the man, who was the formidable\nstumbling-block to all their diplomatic intrigues.\n\nThe Duke himself, in spite of his haughty aloofness from party politics,\nknew full well how great was the enmity which his personality aroused in\nthe minds of all the strangers at Mary's court.\n\nHe was certainly much more amused than disturbed by this generally\nhostile attitude towards himself, and many a time did the various\nambassadors have to suffer, with seeming good-nature, the pointed and\ncaustic shafts aimed at them by His Grace's ready wit.\n\nNo wonder, therefore, that Wessex looked with some suspicion on this\nsudden change of front on the part of one of his most avowed\nantagonists.\n\n\"How can I have the honour of serving an envoy of the King of Spain?\" he\ncontinued lightly.\n\nBut Don Miguel appeared in no hurry to speak. His manner seemed to have\ncompletely altered. As a rule he was a perfect model of self-possession\nand easy confidence, with just a reflection of his distinguished\nchief's, the Cardinal's, own suavity of manner apparent in all his ways.\nNow he was obviously ill at ease, shy and nervous, and with a marked\ndesire to be frank, yet too bashful to give vent to so boyish an\noutburst.\n\nThere was in his dark eyes, too, a look almost of appeal towards the\nDuke to meet his sudden access of friendliness half-way. All this Wessex\nhad already noticed with the one quick glance which he cast at the young\nSpaniard. He motioned him to a chair and himself leant lightly against\nthe edge of the table.\n\nDon Miguel took this to be an encouragement to proceed.\n\n\"Firstly, your Grace's pardon if I should unwillingly transgress,\" he\nbegan.\n\n\"My pardon?\" rejoined the Duke, much amused at the Marquis' obvious\nembarrassment. \"'Tis yours already. But how transgress?\"\n\n\"By the asking of a question which Your Grace might deem indiscreet.\"\n\n\"Nay, my lord,\" quoth the Duke gaily, \"no question need be indiscreet,\nthough answers often are.\"\n\n\"Your Grace is pleased to laugh .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but in this case .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nthat is .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I hardly know how to put it .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. yet I would assure Your\nGrace .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"By Our Lady, man!\" cried Wessex with a slight show of impatience,\n\"assure me no assurances, but tell me what you wish to say.\"\n\n\"Well then! since I have Your Grace's leave. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. My object is this.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Court gossip has it that you are affianced to the Lady Ursula\nGlynde.\"\n\nThe Duke did not reply. Don Miguel looked up and saw a quaint smile\nhovering round His Grace's lips. The young Spaniard, though an earnest\nand even proficient reader of other men's thoughts, did not quite\nunderstand the meaning of that smile: it seemed wistful yet triumphant,\nfull of gaiety and yet with a suspicion of that strange and delicious\nmelancholy, which is never quite inseparable from a great happiness.\n\nBut as he seemingly was meeting with no rebuff, the Marquis continued\nmore boldly--\n\n\"And .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but Your Grace must really pardon me. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I hardly know\nhow to put it so as not to appear impertinent .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but 'tis also said\nthat you do not wish to claim the lady's hand.\"\n\n\"Marry! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" rejoined the Duke with a laugh. Then he paused, as if in\nthe act of recalling his somewhat roving thoughts, and said more\ncoldly--\n\n\"You must pardon me, my lord, if I do not quite perceive in what manner\nthis may concern you.\"\n\n\"I pray Your Grace to have patience with me yet a while longer. I will\nexplain my purpose directly. For the moment I will entreat you, an you\nwill, to answer my question. It is a matter of serious moment to me, and\nyou would render me eternally your debtor.\"\n\nNone knew better in these days than did the high-born Spaniards, all the\nmany little tricks of voice and gesture which go to make up the abstruse\nand difficult art of diplomacy. Don Miguel at this juncture looked so\nfrank, so boyish, and withal so earnest, that the Duke of\nWessex--himself the soul of truth and candour--never even suspected that\nthe young man was but playing a part and enacting a scene, which he had\nrehearsed under the skilful management of His Eminence the Spanish\nCardinal.\n\nWessex, ever ready to see the merry side of life, ever ready for gaiety\nand brightness, felt completely disarmed, glad enough to lay aside the\ncold reserve which the foreign envoys themselves had called forth in\nhim. He liked the Marquis under this new semblance of boyish\nguilelessness, and returned his tone of deferential frankness with one\nof easy familiarity.\n\n\"The question, my lord, is somewhat difficult to answer,\" he said with\nmock seriousness, the while a gay laugh was dancing in his eyes. \"You\nsee, there are certain difficulties in the way. The Lady Ursula is a\nGlynde .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and all the Glyndes have brown eyes. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Now at this\nmoment I feel as if I could never love a brown eye again.\"\n\n\"The Lady Ursula is very beautiful,\" rejoined the Spaniard.\n\n\"Possibly--but you surprise me.\"\n\n\"Your Grace has never seen her?\"\n\n\"Never, since she was out of her cradle.\"\n\n\"I have the advantage of Your Grace, then.\"\n\n\"You know her, my lord? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Intimately!\" said Don Miguel, with what seemed an irresistible impulse.\n\nThen he checked his enthusiasm with a visible effort, and stammered with\na return of his previous nervousness--\n\n\"That is .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" queried the Duke.\n\n\"That is the purport of my importunity, my lord,\" said the young man,\nspringing to his feet and speaking once more in tones of noble candour.\n\"I would have asked Your Grace that, since you do not know the Lady\nUrsula, since you have no wish to claim her hand, if some one else\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"If the Lady Ursula honoured some one else than my unworthy self. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nIs that your meaning, my lord?\" queried Wessex, as Don Miguel had made a\nslight pause in his impetuous speech.\n\n\"If I .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"You, my lord?\"\n\n\"I would wish to know if I should be offending Your Grace?\"\n\n\"Offending me?\" cried Wessex joyfully. \"Nay, my lord, why were you so\nlong in telling me this gladsome news? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Offending me? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you\nhave succeeded in taking a load from my conscience, my dear Marquis. So\nyou love the Lady Ursula Glynde? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Ye heavens! what a number of\ncircumlocutions to arrive at this simple little fact! You love her .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nshe is very beautiful .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and she loves you. Where did you first see\nher, my lord?\"\n\n\"At East Molesey Fair. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Your Grace intervened .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you must\nremember!\"\n\n\"Most inopportunely, meseems. I must indeed crave your pardon. And since\nthen?\"\n\n\"The acquaintanceship, perhaps somewhat unpleasantly begun, has ripened\ninto .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. friendship.\"\n\n\"And thence into love! Nay, you have my heartiest congratulations, my\nlord. The Glyndes are famous for their virtue, and since the Lady Ursula\nis beautiful, why! your Court will indeed be graced by such a pattern of\nEnglish womanhood.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said the Spaniard, with a quick gesture of deprecation.\n\n\"Nay! you must have no fear, my lord. Since you have honoured me by\nconsulting my feelings in the matter, it shall be my pride and my\ndelight to further your cause, and that of the Lady Ursula .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. if\nindeed she will deign to express her wishes to me. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I hereby give\nyou a gentleman's word of honour that I consider the promise, which she\nmade to her father in her childhood, in no way binding upon her now.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. As for the future, I swear that I will obtain Her Majesty's\nconsent to your immediate marriage.\"\n\n\"Nay! I pray you, not so fast!\" laughed Don Miguel lightly. \"Neither the\nLady Ursula nor I have need of Her Majesty's consent. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"But methought----\"\n\n\"'Twas not I who spoke of marriage, remember!\"\n\n\"Then you have completely bewildered me, my lord,\" rejoined Wessex with\na sudden frown. \"I understood----\"\n\n\"That I am the proudest of men, certainly,\" quoth Don Miguel with a\nsarcastic curl of his sensual lip, \"but 'twas Your Grace who spoke of\nthe lady's virtue. I merely wished to know if I should be offending\nYour Grace if .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHe laughed and shrugged his shoulders. The laugh grated unpleasantly on\nWessex' ear, and the gesture savoured of impertinence. The Marquis'\nmanner had suddenly undergone a change, which caused the Duke's every\nnerve to tingle.\n\n\"If what?\" he queried curtly. \"The devil! sir, cannot you say what you\ndo mean?\"\n\n\"Why should I,\" replied the Spaniard, \"since your Grace has already\nguessed? You will own that I have acted _en galant homme_, by thinking\nof your wishes. You will not surely desire to champion that much-vaunted\nvirtue of the Glyndes.\"\n\n\"Then what you mean, sir, is that .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"I cannot speak more plainly, my lord, for that among gentlemen is quite\nimpossible. But rumours fly about quickly at Court, and I feared that\nYour Grace might have caught one, ere I had the chance of assuring you\nthat I recognize the priority of your claim. But now you tell me that\nyou have no further interest in the lady, so I am reassured. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. We\nforeigners, you know, take passing pleasures more lightly than you\nserious-minded English .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and if the lady be unattached .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and\nmore than willing .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. why should we play the part of Joseph? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. a\nridiculous r\u00c3\u00b4le at best, eh, my lord? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and one, I think, which Your\nGrace would ever disdain to play. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. As for me, I am quite reassured\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Au revoir to Your Grace. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nAnd before Wessex had time to utter another word, Don Miguel, still\nlaughing, went out of the room.\n\nThe Duke felt a little bewildered. The conversation had gone through\nsuch a sudden transition, that at the time, he had hardly realized\nwhether it touched him deeply or not.\n\nOwing to Ursula's girlish little ruse, he was totally unaware of her\nidentity with the lady who had been the subject of this very distasteful\ndiscussion. To him Lady Ursula Glynde was both unknown and\nuninteresting. His meeting with beautiful, exquisite \"Fanny\" had driven\nall thoughts of other women from his mind.\n\nBut with all his volatile disposition, where women were concerned, the\nDuke of Wessex was nevertheless imbued with a strong and romantic\nfeeling of chivalry towards the entire sex, and Don Miguel's disdainful\nallusions to the lady who might have been Duchess of Wessex had left his\nfinger-tips itching with the desire to throw his glove in the impudent\nrascal's face.\n\nHarry Plantagenet, who throughout the interview had openly expressed his\ndisapproval of his master's interlocutor, gave an impatient little\nwhine. He longed for the privacy of his own apartments, the warmth of\nthe rugs laid out specially for him.\n\n\"Harry, old friend!\" said Wessex thoughtfully, \"what the devil, think\nyou, that young reprobate meant?\"\n\nHe took the dog's beautiful head between his hands and looked straight\ninto the honest, faithful eyes of his dear and constant companion.\n\n\"Marry!\" he continued more lightly, \"you may well look doubtful, you\nwise philosopher, for you know the Glyndes as well as I do. You remember\nold Lady Annabel, whose very look would stop your tail from wagging, and\nCharles, stodgy, silent, serious Charles, who never drank, never\nlaughed, had probably never seen a woman's ankle in his life. And then\nthe Lady Ursula .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. a Glynde .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. do you mind me, old Harry? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\ntherefore as ugly, as a combination of virtue and Scotch descent can\nmake any woman. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Yet, if I caught the rascal's meaning, neither\nScotch descent nor ill looks have proved a shield for the lady's virtue!\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Well, 'tis no business of ours, is it, old Harry? Let us live and\nlet live. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Perhaps Lady Ursula is not ugly .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. perchance that\nunpleasant-looking Spaniard doth truly love her .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and who are we,\nHarry, you and I, that we should prove censorious? Let us to our\napartments, friend, and meditate on woman's frailty and on our own .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nespecially on our own .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. we are mere male creatures, and women are so\nadorable! even when they bristle with virtues like a hedgehog .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but\nlike him too, are cushioned beneath those bristles with a hundred\ncharming, fascinating sins. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Come along, friend, and let us\nmeditate why sin .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. sin of a certain type, remember, should be so\nenchantingly tempting.\"\n\nHarry Plantagenet was a philosopher. He had seen his master in this kind\nof mood before. He wagged his tail as if to express his approval of the\nbroad principles thus submitted for his consideration, but at the same\ntime he showed a distinct desire that his master should talk less and\ncome more speedily to bed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nTHE WHITE QUEEN\n\n\nWessex after a while was ready enough to dismiss the unpleasant subject.\nPerhaps he had no right to be censorious or to resent the Spaniard's\nsomewhat unusual attitude. In England, undoubtedly, a gentleman would\nnever--except under very special circumstances--allude to any passing\nliaison he might have with a lady of his own rank. That was a strict\ncode of honour which had existed from time immemorial, even in the days\nof King Harry's youth, when the virtue of high-born women had been but\nlittle thought of.\n\nAbroad, perhaps, it was different. Spaniards, just then, were noted for\nthe light way in which they regarded the favours of the fair sex, and\nDon Miguel's code of honour had evidently prompted him to consult\nWessex' wishes in the matter of his own intrigue. Loyalty to their own\nsex is perhaps, on the whole, more general in men than is their chivalry\ntowards women, and perhaps the Marquis' feelings would have revolted at\nthe thought of seeing a lady of such light virtue in the position of\nDuchess of Wessex.\n\nBe that as it may, His Grace had no wish to probe the matter further;\nwith a shrug of the shoulders he dismissed it from his thoughts, whilst\nregistering a vow to chastise the young blackguard if his impertinence\nshowed signs of recurrence.\n\nHe was on the point of yielding to his faithful Harry's canine appeals\nby allowing him to lead the way towards his own distant lodgings, when\nhis ear suddenly caught the sound of a silk dress rustling somewhere,\nnot far from where he stood.\n\nAt the end of the room closest to him, a few steps led up to a gallery,\nwhich ran along the wall, finally abutting at a door, which gave access\nto the Duchess of Lincoln's and other ladies' lodgings. The rustle of a\nsilk skirt seemed to come from there.\n\nPerhaps Wessex would not have taken notice of it, except that his every\nthought was filled with a strange excitement since the rencontre of the\nafternoon. At times now he felt as if his very senses ached with the\nlonging to see once more that entrancing, girlish figure, dressed all in\nwhite and crowned with the halo of her exquisite golden hair, to hear\nonce more the sound of that fresh young voice, that merry, childlike\nlaugh, through which there vibrated the thrill of a newly awakened\npassion.\n\nSince he had met her he was conscious of a wonderful change in himself.\nHe did not even analyse his feelings: he knew that he loved her now:\nthat, in a sense, he had always loved her, for his poetic and romantic\ntemperament had ever been in search of that perfect type of womanhood,\nwhich she seemed so completely to embody in herself.\n\nHe had only spoken to her for about half an hour, then had sat opposite\nto her in a boat among the reeds, in the cool of the afternoon, with the\nlazy river gently rocking the light skiff, and the water birds for sole\nwitnesses of his happiness. They had hardly exchanged a word then, for\nhe had enjoyed the delight--dear to every man who loves--of watching the\nblushes come and go upon her cheek in response to his ardent gaze. What\ndid words matter? the music in their souls supplied all that they wished\nto say.\n\nAnd he--who had been deemed so fickle, who had made of love a pastime,\ntaking what joys women would give him with a grateful yet transient\nsmile, His Grace of Wessex, in fact, who had loved so often yet so\ninconstantly--knew now that the stern little god, who will not for long\nbrook defiance of his laws, had wounded him for life or death at last.\n\nAnd even now, when he heard the rustle of a kirtle, he paused\ninstinctively, vaguely, madly hoping that chance, and the great wild\nlonging which was in him, had indeed drawn her footsteps hither.\n\nThe door above, at the end of the gallery, was tentatively opened.\nWessex could see nothing, for those distant corners of the room were in\ncomplete darkness, but he heard a voice, low and sweet, humming the\nlittle ditty which she, his queen, had sung this afternoon.\n\n   \"Disdaine me not that am your own,\n    Refuse me not that am so true,\n    Mistrust me not till all be knowen,\n    Forsake me not now for no new.\"\n\nShe walked slowly along the gallery, and paused not far from the top of\nthe short flight of oak steps. She seemed to be hesitating a little, as\nif afraid to venture farther into the large, dimly lighted hall.\n\nThe flicker of the tall wax tapers now caught her dainty figure, casting\ngolden lights and deep, ruddy shadows on her fair young face and on the\nwhiteness of her gown. In her arms she held an enormous sheaf of pale\npink monthly roses, the spoils of the garden, lavish in its autumnal\nglory.\n\nNever had Wessex--fastidious, fickle, insouciant Wessex--seen anything\nmore radiant, more exquisite, more poetic than this apparition which\ncame towards him like the realization of all his maddest dreams.\n\nFor one moment more he lingered, his ardent, passionate soul was loath\nto give up these heaven-born seconds spent in looking at her. Her eyes\nshone darkly in the gleam of the candle light and had wondrous\nreflections in them, which looked ruddy and hot; her delicately\nchiselled features were suffused with a strange glow, which seemed to\ncome from within; and her lips were slightly parted, moist and red like\nsome ripe summer fruit. From her whole person there came an exhalation\nof youth and womanhood, of purity and soul-stirring passion.\n\n\"Come down, sweet singer,\" said Wessex to her at last.\n\nShe gave a startled little cry, leant over the balustrade, and the sheaf\nof flowers dropped from her arms, falling in a long cascade of leaves\nand blossoms, rose-coloured and sweet-scented, at his feet.\n\n\"Ah, Your Grace frightened me!\" she whispered, with just a touch of\nfeminine coquetry. \"I .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. didn't know you were here.\"\n\n\"I swear you did not, sweet saint .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but now .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. as I am here .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\ncome down quickly ere I perish with longing for a nearer sight of your\ndear eyes.\"\n\n\"But my flowers,\" she said, with a sudden access of timidity, brought\nforth by the thrilling ardour of his voice. \"I had picked them for Her\nMajesty's oratory.\"\n\n\"Nay! let them all wither save one .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. which I will take from your\nhand. Come down. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nOne of the roses had remained fixed in the stiff fold of her panier. She\ntook it between her fingers and sighed.\n\n\"Oh! I dare not,\" she said sadly. \"Your Grace does not know,--cannot\nguess, what dire disgrace would befall me if I did.\"\n\n\"Perish the thought of disgrace,\" rejoined Wessex gaily. \"Marry! the\nsaints in Paradise must come down from heaven sometimes, else the world\nwould be consumed by its own wickedness. Come down,\" he added more\nearnestly, seized with a mad, ungovernable desire to clasp her to his\nheart, \"come down, or I swear that I'll bring you down in my arms.\"\n\n\"No .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. no .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. no!\" she protested, alarmed at his vehemence. \"I'll\ncome down.\"\n\nWith a quaintly mischievous gesture she flung the rose at him; it hit\nhim in the face, then fell; he had perforce to stoop in order to pick it\nup. When he once more straightened his tall figure she was standing\nquite close to him.\n\nThere she was, just as he had always thought of her, even as a boy when\nfirst he began to dream. She, the perfect woman whom one day he would\nmeet, and on that day would love wholly, passionately, humbly, and\nproudly, his own and yet his queen; she the most perfect product of\nNature, with just that tone of gold in her hair, just those eyes, so\ninscrutable, so full of colour, so infinite in their variety; not very\ntall, but graceful and slender, with her dainty head on a level with his\nshoulder, her fair young forehead on a level with his lips.\n\nNow that she was so near, he was as if turned to stone. The wild longing\nwas still in him to clasp her in his arms, to hold her closely, tenderly\nto his heart, yet he would not have touched her for a kingdom.\n\nBut as he looked at her he knew that she, herself, would come to him in\nall her purity, her innocence .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. soon .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. to-day perhaps .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but\ncertainly one day .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and that she would come with every fibre in her\nentire being vibrating in responsive passion to him.\n\nShe looked up at him shyly, tentatively. His very soul went out to her\nas he returned her gaze. A great and glorious exultation thrilled every\nfibre of her being. She knew that she had conquered, that the love which\nin her girlish heart she had kept for him had borne fruit a\nthousandfold. Her heart seemed to stop beating at the immensity of her\nhappiness.\n\nBut woman-like, she was more self-possessed than he was.\n\n\"I must not stay,\" she said gravely and with only an imperceptible\nquiver in her voice. \"I am in disgrace, you know .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. for that stroll\non the river .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. with you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Why? what happened?\" he asked with a smile.\n\nShe held up her little hand and counted on her fingers.\n\n\"Number one, a frown and a colder shoulder from Her Majesty! Two, a\nlecture from Her Grace of Lincoln! Twenty minutes! Three, four, and\nfive, pin-pricks from the ladies and a lonely supper in my room\nto-night.\"\n\nHe loved her in this gayer mood which made her seem so young and\nchildlike.\n\n\"Could you not have contrived to let me know?\"\n\n\"Why? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. What would you have done?\"\n\n\"Made it less lonely for you.\"\n\n\"You are doing that now. I thought I should be alone the rest of the\nevening. Her Grace of Lincoln and the others are at prayers with Her\nMajesty. I was confined to that room up there. How is it Your Grace\nhappened to be in this hall just when I came out?\"\n\n\"A moth is always to be found where the light happens to be,\" he replied\ngravely.\n\n\"But how did you know I should be here?\"\n\n\"My eyes, since this afternoon, see you constantly where you are\nnot--how could they fail to see you where you are?\"\n\n\"Then, as Your Grace has seen me .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" she added with timid\nnervousness, seeing that he now stood between her and the steps, \"will\nyou allow me to go up again?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I entreat!\" she pleaded.\n\n\"Impossible.\"\n\n\"Her Grace of Lincoln will be looking for me.\"\n\n\"Then stay here with me until she does.\"\n\n\"What to do?\" she queried innocently.\n\n\"To make me happy.\"\n\n\"Happy?\" she laughed merrily. \"Ho! ho! ho! How can I, a humble\nwaiting-maid, manage to make His Grace of Wessex happy?\"\n\n\"By letting me look at you.\"\n\nWith quaint and artless coquetry she picked up the folds of her heavy\nbrocaded paniers, right and left, with two delicate fingers, and\nexecuted a dainty pirouette in front of him.\n\n\"There!\" she said merrily, \"'tis done. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. And now?\"\n\n\"By letting me whisper to you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" he murmured.\n\nShe drew back quickly, and said with mock severity--\n\n\"That which I must not hear.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because Your Grace is not free,\" she rejoined archly. \"Not free to\nwhisper anything in any woman's ear, save in that of Lady Ursula\nGlynde.\"\n\n\"Then you guessed what I would have whispered to you?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"What was it?\"\n\nShe veiled the glory of her eyes with their fringe of dark lashes.\n\n\"That you loved me .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" she murmured, \"for the moment. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHow irresistible she was, with just that soup\u00c3\u00a7on of coquetry to whet the\ndesire of this fastidious man of the world, and with it all so free from\nartifice, so young and fresh and pure:--a madonna, yet made to tempt\nmankind.\n\n\"Nay! if you would let me, sweet saint, I would whisper in your tiny ear\nthat I worship you!\" he said in all sincerity and truth, and with the\nring of an ardent passion in every tone of his voice.\n\n\"Worship me? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" she queried in mock astonishment, \"and Your Grace\ndoes not even know who I am.\"\n\n\"Faith! but I do. You are the most beautiful woman on this earth.\"\n\n\"Oh! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but my name! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Nay! as to that I care not .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. You shall tell it me anon, if you\nlike. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. For the moment I love to think of you as I first beheld you\nin the garden this afternoon--a fairy or sprite .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I know not which\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. an angel mayhap .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. in your robes of white, surrounded with\nflowers and dark bosquets of hazelnut and of yew, with golden tints of\nruddy autumn around you, less glorious than your hair. Let me worship\nblindly .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. fettered .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. your slave.\"\n\nShe sighed, a quaint little sigh, which had a tinge of melancholy in it.\n\n\"For how long?\" she murmured.\n\n\"For my whole life,\" he replied earnestly. \"Will you not try me?\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"You love me, sweet saint?\"\n\n\"I .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" she began shyly.\n\n\"Let me look into your eyes. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I will find my answer.\"\n\nHer arms dropped by her side, she looked up and met his eyes, ardent,\nburning with passion, fixed longingly upon her. He came close to her,\nquite close, his presence thrilled her; she closed her eyes in order to\nshut out from her innermost soul everything from the outside world, save\nthe exquisite feeling of her newly awakened love.\n\n\"Now, see how perverse I am,\" he whispered passionately. \"I do not want\nyou to tell me anything just now .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. open your eyes, dear saint .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nfor I but want to stand like this .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and read in their blue depths\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. enjoying every fraction of a second of this heavenly moment.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nShe tried to speak, but instinctively he stopped her.\n\n\"No .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. no .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. do not speak. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. And yet .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. 'tis from your\nsweet lips I'd have my final answer.\"\n\nHe took her in his arms. She lay against him, unresisting, her sweet\nface turned up to his, soul meeting soul at last in the ecstasy of a\nfirst kiss. He held her to his heart. It seemed as if he could never let\nher go from him again. Everything was forgotten, the world had ceased to\nbe. For him there was but one woman on this earth, and she was his own.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nCHECK TO THE QUEEN\n\n\nHow long they stood thus, heart to heart, they themselves could never\nhave said. The sound of many voices in the near distance roused them\nfrom their dream. Ursula started in alarm.\n\n\"Holy Virgin!\" she exclaimed under her breath, \"if it should be the\nQueen!\"\n\nBut Wessex held her tightly, and she struggled in vain.\n\n\"Nay! then let the whole Court see that I hold my future wife in my\narms,\" he said proudly.\n\nBut with an agitated little cry she contrived to escape him. He seemed\nmuch amused at her nervousness; what had she to fear? was she not his\nown, to protect even from the semblance of ill? But Ursula, now fully\nawakened to ordinary, everyday surroundings, was fearful lest her own\ninnocent little deception should be too crudely, too suddenly unmasked.\n\nShe had so earnestly looked forward to the moment when she would say to\nhim that she in sooth was none other than Lady Ursula Glynde, the woman\nwhom every conventionality had decreed that he should marry, and\nwhom--because of these conventionalities--he had secretly but certainly\ndisliked.\n\nHer woman's heart had already given her a clear insight into the\ncharacter and the foibles of the man she loved. His passion for her now,\nsincere and great though it was, was partly dependent on that atmosphere\nof romance which his poetical temperament craved for, and which had\nsurrounded the half-mysterious personality of exquisite, irresistible\n\"Fanny.\"\n\nInstinctively she dreaded the rough hand of commonplace, that ugly,\ncoarse destroyer of poetic idylls. A few hastily uttered words might\nshatter in an hour the mystic shrine wherein Wessex had enthroned her.\nShe had meant to tell him soon, to-morrow perhaps, perhaps only after a\nfew days, but she wished to find her own time for this, when he knew her\ninner soul better, and the delicate cobwebs of this great\nlove-at-first-sight had fallen away from his eyes.\n\nShe could not altogether have explained to herself why a sudden\ndisclosure of her identity at this moment would have been peculiarly\nunpleasant to her. It was a weak, childish feeling no doubt. But such as\nit was, it was real, and strong, and genuine.\n\nBarely a minute had elapsed whilst these quick thoughts and fears went\nwildly coursing through her mind. There was no time to tell him\neverything now. The voices came from the next room, within the next few\nseconds probably the great door would be open to admit a group of\npeople: the Duchess of Lincoln and the ladies mayhap, or the Queen on\nher way to chapel. And His Grace of Wessex looked terribly determined.\n\n\"No! no! no!--not just this moment, sweet Grace,\" she entreated, \"by\nyour love! not _just_ this moment. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. The Queen would be so angry\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. oh! not _just_ now!\"\n\nShe looked so genuinely disturbed, and so tenderly appealing, that he\ncould not help but obey.\n\n\"But you cannot send me away like this,\" he urged. \"Another word, sweet\nsaint. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Faith! I could not live without another kiss. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"No, no, no, I entreat Your Grace .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. not to-night,\" she protested\nfeebly.\n\nHe thought, however, that he detected a sign of yielding in her voice,\nalthough she was already beginning to mount the steps ready for flight.\n\n\"Just one tiny word,\" he whispered hurriedly: \"when the Queen has passed\nthrough, linger up there for one brief minute only. I'll wait in there!\"\n\nAnd he pointed to a small door close behind him, which led to an inner\ncloset at right angles with the gallery. Before she had time to\nprotest--nay! perhaps she had no wish to refuse--he had disappeared\nbehind its heavy panels, quickly calling to his dog to follow him. But\nin that one moment's hesitation, those few brief and delicious words\nhastily exchanged, she had lost her opportunity for escape.\n\nThe next instant the door at the further end of the room was thrown\nopen, and the Queen entered followed by some of her ladies. She was\naccompanied by the Duchess of Lincoln, and His Eminence the Cardinal de\nMoreno was on her left.\n\nAs chance or ill-luck would have it, the first sight which greeted Her\nMajesty's eyes was the figure of Lady Ursula, midway up the steps which\nled to the gallery, some mysterious imp of mischief having contrived\nthat the light from the wax tapers should unaccountably and very vividly\nfall upon the white-clad form of the young girl. An exclamation of stern\nreproval from Her Grace of Lincoln brought Ursula to a standstill.\n\nFlight now was no longer possible; she could but trust in her guardian\nangel, or in any of those protective genii who have in their keeping the\nspecial care of lovers in distress, and who happened to be hovering\nnigh.\n\nIt was not seemly to be half-way up a flight of stairs when Her Majesty\nwas standing on the floor below. Ursula, with her cheeks aflame with\nvexation, slowly descended, whilst encountering as boldly as she could\nthe artillery fire of half a dozen pairs of eyes fixed steadily upon\nher.\n\nMary Tudor looked coldly severe, Her Grace of Lincoln horror-struck, His\nEminence ironical, and the ladies vastly amused.\n\n\"Ah, child!\" said Her Majesty, in her iciest tone of voice, \"all alone,\nand in this part of the Palace?\"\n\nShe looked the dainty young figure disdainfully up and down, then her\neye caught the sheaf of roses lying in a fragrant tangle close to the\nfoot of the stairs. There was a quick flash of anger in her face, then a\nfrown. Ursula wondered how much she guessed or what she suspected.\n\nBut the Queen, after that one quick wave of passionate wrath, made an\nobvious effort to control herself. She turned composedly to the Duchess\nof Lincoln.\n\n\"Your Grace is aware,\" she said drily, \"that I deem it most indecorous\nfor my maids-of-honour to wander about the Palace alone.\"\n\nThe wrinkled old face of the kindly Duchess expressed the most heartfelt\nsorrow.\n\n\"I crave Your Majesty's humble pardon .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" she stammered in an agony\nof misery at this public reproof. \"I .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Nay, Duchess, I know the difficulty of your task,\" rejoined Mary Tudor\nbitingly, \"the other ladies are docile, and their behaviour is maidenly\nand chaste. 'Tis not always so with the Lady Ursula Glynde.\"\n\nMary's voice had been so trenchant and hard that it seemed to Ursula's\nsensitive ears as if its metallic tones must have penetrated to every\ncorner of the Palace. She gave a quick, terrified look towards the door,\nlonging with all her might for the gift to see through its massive\npanels--to know what went on within that inner closet, where Wessex was\nwaiting and must have heard.\n\nOne pair of eyes, however, had caught that swift glance, and noted the\nsudden obvious fright which accompanied it. His Eminence had not taken\nhis piercing eyes from off the young girl's face; he had seen every\nmovement of the delicate nostril, every quiver of the eyelid.\n\nWhat Mary Tudor only half suspected, what the good old Duchess could not\neven conjecture, that His Eminence had already more than guessed.\n\nThe delicate, rosy blush which suffused the young girl's cheeks, that\nindescribable something which emanated from her entire personality, the\nhalf-withered roses, all told their tale to this experienced\ndiplomatist, accustomed to read his fellow-creature's thoughts. Then\nthat quick, apprehensive look towards the door had confirmed his every\nsurmise.\n\n\"She has seen His Grace. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. He is closeted in there!\" were his\nimmediate mental deductions. And whilst Ursula met Her Majesty's cold\nglances with as much boldness as she could command, and Her Grace of\nLincoln lost herself in a maze of abject apologies, His Eminence,\nseemingly unconcerned, edged up to the low door, keeping the lock and\nhandle thereof well in view.\n\n\"I crave Your Majesty's indulgence for the child,\" the Duchess of\nLincoln was muttering. \"She meant no harm, I'll take my oath on that,\nand she will, I know, return at once to her room, there to grieve over\nYour Majesty's disapproval of her. She----\"\n\n\"Nay, Duchess,\" interrupted the Queen sternly, \"repentance is far from\nLady Ursula's thoughts, and her behaviour is not the thoughtlessness of\na moment.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" protested the Duchess, whilst Ursula threw her head\nback in token of proud denial.\n\n\"The rumour has already reached us,\" continued Mary, \"of a\nmaid-of-honour's strange wanderings at night and in disguise outside the\npurlieus of the Palace, and that the maiden who so far forgot her rank\nand her modesty was none other than the Lady Ursula Glynde.\"\n\nAgain that quick apprehensive glance directed towards the closet door at\nmention of her name, a glance unseen by any one present save by His\nEminence's watchful eyes. To him it had revealed all that he wished to\nknow, whilst the Queen, blinded by her own jealousy, saw nothing but a\nrival whom she desired to humiliate.\n\n\"Wessex is behind that door .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" mused His Eminence. \"She starts every\ntime her name is uttered .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. ergo, he made love to her without knowing\nwho she is.\"\n\nIt was natural and simple. The very logical sequence of a series of\nco-ordinated thoughts, together with a shrewd knowledge of human nature.\n\nHow this little incident would affect his own immediate plans His\nEminence had not yet conjectured. That it would prove of vast\nimportance, he was never for a moment in doubt. Therefore, at a moment\nwhen every one's eyes were fixed upon the Queen or Ursula, he quietly\nturned the key in the lock of that closet door, and slipped the key in\nhis own pocket.\n\nAfter that he rejoined the group of ladies, feeling that he could wait\nin peace until the close of the dramatic little episode.\n\n\"The rumour, if rumour there was,\" Ursula had retorted defiantly, \"is a\nfalse one, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Indeed, child,\" said the Queen coldly, \"did you not, then, some days\nago leave the Palace with no other companion save weak-willed Margaret\nCobham?\"\n\n\"Verily, I .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"In order to visit, in disguise, or masked, or cloaked--we know\nnot--some public entertainment, a country fair, methinks?\"\n\n\"Of a truth, but .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"You do not deny that, meseems.\"\n\n\"I do not deny it, Your Majesty. I meant no harm.\"\n\n\"No harm! hark at the girl! Was there no harm then in your meeting\ncertain gentlemen of our Court, under circumstances not altogether\ncreditable to the fair fame of our English maidens?\"\n\n\"Has the Marquis de Suarez dared. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Nay! We did not name the Marquis, girl. Of a truth a gentleman will\ndare all, once a maid forgets her own dignity. But enough of this. I\nspoke a word of warning in your own interests. The Marquis--saving His\nEminence's presence--has all the faults of his race. We warn you to\ncease this intercourse, which doth no credit to your modesty.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" retorted Ursula, proud and rebellious at this\nslight put upon her, and forgetting for the moment even the invisible\npresence of the man she loved.\n\nBut Mary Tudor, though at times capable of noble and just impulses, was\nfar too blinded by her own passion to give up the joy of this victory\nover the girl who had become her rival. At any rate, Fate had done one\ngreat thing for her: she was the Queen, ruling as every Tudor had ruled,\nby divine right, absolutely, unquestionably.\n\nShe would not let the girl speak, she would see her go, humiliated, with\nhead bent, forcibly swallowing her tears of shame. Mary only regretted\nthis: that Wessex could not be witness of this scene.\n\nShe threw back her head, drew herself up to her full height, and pointed\nperemptorily up towards the gallery.\n\n\"Silence, wench!\" she commanded. \"Go!\"\n\nAnd Ursula could not help but obey.\n\nSlowly she mounted the stairs, her heart burning with defiance. To have\nangered Mary Tudor further by renewed rebellion would have been worse\nthan madness; it would inevitably have brought more ignominy and worse\nperchance upon herself.\n\nBut the tears, which she tried in vain to suppress, were not caused by\nthe Queen's harsh words, but by the terrible doubts which assailed her\nwhen she thought of Wessex.\n\nHad he heard?\n\nWhat would he think?\n\nWould he understand the cause of her innocent deception, or would he\nbelieve--as indeed he must if he heard them--the evil insinuations so\nbasely put forward by the Queen.\n\nAs she found her way along the gallery she heard Mary's voice once more.\n\n\"Duchess, I pray you see that in future more strict surveillance is kept\nover the young maids under your charge. Lady Ursula's conduct has put me\nverily to shame before the ambassadors of foreign Courts.\"\n\nWith a sob of impotent revolt Ursula disappeared within the upper room.\n\nThe Cardinal watched her until the door closed upon her and he was quite\nsure that she was well out of hearing. Then he approached the Queen and\nsaid in his most suave manner--\n\n\"Nay! Your Majesty, methinks, takes this trifling matter too much _au\ns\u00c3\u00a9rieux_. You deigned to mention the Marquis de Suarez just now. Believe\nme, he is far too proud of the favours bestowed upon him by Lady Ursula\nto look on England with any reproach.\"\n\nThe Duchess of Lincoln would have spoken, if she dared. Her loyal old\nsoul rebelled against this insinuation, which she knew to be utterly\nfalse. But to tax His Eminence with the uttering of unfounded gossip and\nin the presence of the Queen of England--that task was quite beyond the\nworthy Duchess's powers.\n\nBut in her motherly heart she registered the resolution to take\nUrsula's part as hotly as she dared whenever Her Majesty would give her\nleave to speak, and in any case she would not allow the Cardinal's\nimputation to rest long upon the innocent young girl.\n\nThe Queen, on the other hand, had visibly brightened up when His\nEminence himself mentioned the name of the young Spaniard in such close\nconnection with that of Ursula. She seemed to drink in with delight the\npoisoned cup of thinly veiled slander which His Eminence held so\ntemptingly before her.\n\nShe wanted to think of Ursula as base and wanton and had, until now,\nnever quite dared to believe the many strange rumours which certainly\nhad reached her ears.\n\nWith all her faults, Mary was a just woman and above all a proud one;\nshe would never have allowed her rival to suffer long and seriously\nunder a false calumny. The name of the Marquis de Suarez, when she\nuttered it, had been but a shaft hurled at random.\n\nBut since His Eminence so palpably hinted a confirmation of her hopes,\nshe was more than ready to give his insinuations the fullest credence.\nSo pleased was she that she gave him quite a pleasant smile, the first\nhe had had from her since the afternoon.\n\n\"As Your Eminence justly remarks,\" she said graciously, \"the matter is\nperhaps not of grave moment. But our interest in the young maidens who\nform our Court is a genuine one nevertheless. I pray you let it\npass--Duchess, we'll speak of it all on the morrow. My lord Cardinal, we\nwill wish you good night.\"\n\nShe was about to finally pass him and to leave the room when her\ncuriosity got the better of her usual dignified reserve.\n\n\"Is it the last night Your Eminence will spend at our Court?\" she asked\npointedly.\n\n\"I think not, Your Majesty,\" replied the Cardinal blandly. \"'Tis many\ndays yet which I shall hope to spend in Your Majesty's company.\"\n\n\"Yet the skein is still entangled, my lord.\"\n\n\"'Twill be unravelled, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"_Quien sabe?_\" he replied. \"Perhaps to-night.\"\n\n\"To-night?\"\n\nShe had allowed herself to be led away by the eagerness of her desire to\nknow what was happening. Shrewd enough where her own wishes and plans\nwere concerned, she could not help but notice the air of contentment,\neven of triumph, which the Cardinal had worn throughout the evening. He\ncertainly did not look like a man about to be sent back discomfited, to\nan irate master, there to explain that he had failed in the task\nallotted to him.\n\nMary's curiosity was very much on the alert, but His Eminence's\nmonosyllabic answers were not intended to satisfy her, and perforce she\nhad to desist from further questioning him. Obviously he did not mean to\ntell her anything just yet. She bade him good night with more\ngraciousness than he could have anticipated, and his bow to her was full\nof the most profound respect.\n\nA moment later she had passed out of the room, followed by Her Grace of\nLincoln and her maids-of-honour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nCHECK TO THE KING\n\n\nThe colloquy between Mary Tudor and Ursula Glynde had probably not\nlasted more than a few minutes.\n\nTo Wessex it seemed as if years had elapsed since he had closed the door\nof the small inner room behind him, shutting out from his sight the\nbeautiful vision which had filled his soul with gladness.\n\nYears! during which he had learnt chapter by chapter, the history of\nwoman's frailty and deceit. Now, he suddenly felt old, all the buoyancy\nhad gone out of his life, and he was left worn and weary, with a\nmillstone of shattered illusions hung around his neck.\n\nIt had come about so strangely.\n\nShe was not exquisite \"Fanny,\" mysterious, elusive, after all. She was\nLady Ursula Glynde.\n\nWell! what mattered that?\n\nThe name first pronounced by the Queen's trenchant voice had grated\nharshly on his ear. Why?\n\nAt first he could not remember.\n\nFanny or Ursula? Why not? The woman whom conventionality had in some\nsense ordained that he should marry. Why not?\n\nSurely 'twas for him to thank conventionality for this kind decree.\n\nBut the Lady Ursula Glynde!\n\nWhen did he last hear that name? Surely it was on that Spaniard's lips\nhalf an hour ago, accompanied by a thinly veiled, coarse jest and an\nimpudent laugh.\n\nBut his \"Fanny!\"--that white-clad, poetic embodiment of his most exalted\ndreams! Those guileless blue eyes--or were they black?--that childlike\nlittle head so fitly crowned with gold!\n\nNo! no! _that_ was his \"Fanny,\" not the other woman, whom the Queen was\neven now upbraiding for immodest conduct.\n\nNow she was speaking .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. stammering .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. denying nothing. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Where\nwas that Ursula Glynde? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. the other woman .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. she who was false\nand wanton. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. \"Fanny\" was pure and sweet and girlish. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Ursula\nalone was to blame. Where was she?\n\n\"Has the Marquis de Suarez dared .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nIt was her voice. Why did she name that man?\n\nShe knew him then? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. had met him at East Molesey Fair? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. she did\nnot deny it .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. she only asked if he had dared .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. whilst the\nSpaniard had said, with a flippant shrug of the shoulders, that the\nacquaintanceship had ripened into .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. friendship.\n\nWessex' whole soul rebelled at this suggestion. He had but one desire,\nto see her, to ask her--she would tell him the truth, and he would\nbelieve whatever she told him with those dear red lips of hers, which he\nhad kissed.\n\nHe felt quite calm, still, firm in his faith, and sustained by his great\nlove. He went to the door and found it locked.\n\nA trifling matter surely, but why was it locked?\n\nShe had been upset, confused, ere the Queen had come. She would not\nallow him the great joy of proclaiming to all who were there to hear,\nthat he had wooed and won her. Once more there came that torturing\nquestion: Why?\n\nSo averse was she to his appearing before the Queen, that she had locked\nthe door for fear that the exuberant happiness which was in him, should\ncause him to precipitate a climax which she obviously dreaded.\n\nWhy? Why? Why?\n\nBut he would respect her wishes, and though his very sinews ached with\nthe longing to break down that door, to see her then and there, not to\nendure for another second this maddening agony which made his temples\nthrob and his brain reel, he made no attempt to touch the bolts again.\n\nJust then there came the Queen's final words to her:\n\n\"The Marquis de Suarez has all the faults of his race. We warn you to\ncease this intercourse which doth no credit to your modesty.\"\n\nAnd she--his love, his cherished dream--had said nothing in reply.\nWessex strained his every sense to hear, but there came nothing save--\n\n\"Your Majesty .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nAnd then the peremptory--\n\n\"Silence, wench!\" from irate Mary Tudor.\n\nAnd then nothing more.\n\nShe had gone evidently, bearing her humiliation, leaving him in doubt\nand fear, to endure a torture of the soul which well-nigh unmanned him.\n\nShe must have known that he had heard, and yet she said nothing.\n\nTo the Duke of Wessex, the most favoured man in England, the grand\nseigneur with one foot on the throne, the idea of suffering a false\naccusation in silence was a thing absolutely beyond\ncomprehension--weakness which must have its origin in guilt.\n\nHuman nature is so constituted that man is bound to measure his\nfellow-creatures by his own standard; else why doth charity think no\nevil? The goodness and purity which comes from the soul is always\nmirrored in the soul of others. Evil sees evil everywhere. Pride does\nnot understand humility.\n\nThus in Wessex' heart!\n\nHad his sovereign liege--that sovereign being a man--dared to put forth\na base insinuation against him, he would have forgotten the kingship\nand struck the man, who impeached his honour, fearlessly in the face.\nNothing but conscious guilt would have stayed his avenging hand, or\nsilenced the indignant words on his lips.\n\nOf course he could not see what was actually passing: he could but\nsurmise, and a fevered, tortured brain is an uncertain counsellor.\n\nHe could not understand Ursula's attitude. The girlish weakness, the\nsubmission to the highest authority in the land born of centuries of\ntradition, the maidenly bashfulness at the monstrosity of the\naccusation, were so many little feminine traits which at this moment\nappeared to him as so many admissions of guilt.\n\nHe would have loved them at other times: loved them in _her_ especially,\nbecause they were so characteristic of her simple nature, bred in the\ncountry, half woman and wholly child. Just now they were repellent to\nhis pride, incomprehensible to his manhood, and for the first time his\nfaith began to waver.\n\nPity him, my masters! for he suffered intensely.\n\nPity him, mistress, for he loved her with his whole soul.\n\nNay! do not sneer. Love-at-first-sight is a great and wonderful thing,\nand, more than that, it is real--genuinely, absolutely, completely real.\nBut it is not immutable. It is the basis, the solid foundation of what\nwill become the lasting passion. In itself it has one great\nweakness--the absence of knowledge.\n\nWessex loved with his soul, but not yet with his reason. How could he?\nReason is always the last to fall into line with the other slaves of\npassion. At present he worshipped in her that which he had conceived her\nto be, and the very sublimity of this whole-hearted love was a bar to\nthe existence of perfect trust and faith.\n\nThere had been a long silence whilst Ursula mounted the stairs and\nfinally disappeared, but the rustle of her silk skirt did not penetrate\nthrough the solid panels of the closet door. Wessex did not know whether\nshe had gone, or had been ordered to wait until Her Majesty had quitted\nthe room. He wondered now how soon he would meet her, how she would look\nwhen she finally released him from this torture-chamber. He knew that he\nwould not upbraid her, and feared but one awful eventuality, his own\nweakness if she were guilty.\n\nLove such as his oft makes cowards of men.\n\nTo the Cardinal's poisoned shaft he paid but little heed. The weary soul\nhad come to the end of its tether. It could not suffer more.\n\nBeyond that lay madness or crime.\n\nSilence became oppressive.\n\nThen it seemed as if the key was being gently turned in the lock.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nTHE CARDINAL'S MOVE\n\n\nHis Eminence had been left all alone in the room after the passage of\nHer Majesty to her own apartments.\n\n\"And now, what is the next move in this game of chess?\" he mused, as he\ntook the key of the closet door from his pocket and thoughtfully\ncontemplated this tiny engine of his far-reaching and elaborate schemes.\n\n\"For the moment my guess was a shrewd one. His Grace of Wessex is in\nthere, and had I not locked that door he would have precipitated a\nclimax, which had sent Queen Mary into a fever of jealous rage, and the\nSpanish ambassador and myself back to Spain to-morrow.\"\n\nHe listened intently for a second or so; no sound came from the inner\nroom. Then he glanced up towards the gallery.\n\nThere was, of course, no sign of Lady Ursula. Even if she intended anon\nto rejoin His Grace, she would certainly wait a little while ere she\nonce more ventured to sally forth.\n\nThe Cardinal very softly put the key back into the lock, and waited.\n\nVery soon the door was vigorously shaken. His Eminence retired to the\nfurther end of the room and called loudly--\n\n\"Who goes there?\"\n\n\"By Our Lady!\" came in strong accents from the other side of the locked\ndoor, \"whoever you may be, an you don't open this door, it shall fall\nin splinters atop of you.\"\n\nTime to once more recross the room, and turn a small key, and a second\nlater the Cardinal stood face to face with the Duke of Wessex.\n\n\"His Grace of Wessex!\" he murmured, with an expression of boundless\nastonishment.\n\n\"Himself in person, my lord,\" rejoined Wessex, trying with all his might\nto appear unconcerned before this man, whom he knew to be his deadliest\nenemy. \"Marry!\" he added, with well-acted gaiety, \"the next moment, an\nYour Eminence had not released me, I might have lost my temper.\"\n\n\"A precious trifle Your Grace would no doubt have quickly found again,\"\nsaid His Eminence with marked suavity. \"Ah! I well recollect in my young\ndays being locked in .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. just like Your Grace .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. by a lady who was\nno less fair.\"\n\nHad he entertained the slightest doubt as to whether the little dramatic\nepisode just enacted had borne its bitter fruit, he would have seen it\nsummarily dispelled with the first glance which he had cast at Wessex.\n\nThe Duke's grave face was deadly pale, and the violent effort which he\nmade to contain himself was apparent in the heavily swollen veins of his\ntemples and the almost imperceptible tremor of his hands. But his voice\nwas quite steady as he said lightly--\n\n\"Nay! why should Your Eminence speak of a lady in this case?\"\n\n\"What have I said?\" quoth the Cardinal, throwing up his be-ringed hands\nin mock alarm. \"Nay! Your Grace need have no fear. Discretion is an\nintegral portion of my calling. I was merely indulging in reminiscences.\nMy purple robes do not, as you know, conceal a priest. Though a prince\nof the Church, I am an ecclesiastic only in name, and therefore may\nremember, without a blush, that I was twenty once and very hot-tempered.\nThe lady in my case put me under lock and key whilst she went to another\ngallant.\"\n\n\"Again you speak of a lady, my lord,\" said the Duke, with the same light\nindifference. \"May I ask----\"\n\n\"Nay, nay! I pray you ask me nothing .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I saw nothing, believe me\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHe paused a moment. Wessex had turned to his dog, who, yawning and\nstretching, after the manner of his kind, and not the least upset by his\nrecent incarceration, had just appeared in the doorway of the inner\nroom.\n\n\"I saw nothing,\" continued the Cardinal, with a voice full of gentle,\ngood-natured indulgence, \"save a charming lady standing here alone,\nclose to that door, when I entered with Her Majesty. What Queen Mary\nguessed or feared, alas! I cannot tell. The charming lady had just\nturned the key in the lock .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and this set me thinking of my own\nyouth and follies. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. But Your Grace must pardon an old man who has\nbut one affection left in life. Don Miguel is as a son to me----\"\n\n\"I pray you, my lord,\" here interrupted Wessex haughtily, \"what has the\nMarquis de Suarez' name to do with me?\"\n\n\"Only this, my son,\" rejoined the Cardinal with truly paternal\nbenevolence, \"Don Miguel is a stranger in England .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I had almost\nhoped that hospitality would prevent Your Grace from flying your hawk\nafter his birds. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\n\n\"Don Miguel would be hard hit,\" he added quickly, seeing that Wessex, at\nthe end of his patience, was about to make an angry retort, \"for we all\nknow that where His Grace of Wessex desires to conquer, other vows and\nother lovers are very soon forgotten .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. But the Marquis is young\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I would like to plead his cause. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHis keen eyes had never for a moment strayed from the proud face of the\nDuke. He was shrewd enough to know that in speaking thus, he was\nreaching the outermost limits of His Grace's forbearance. His robes and\nhis age rendered him to a certain extent immune from an actual quarrel\nwith a man of Wessex' physique, nor did fear for his own personal safety\never enter into the far-seeing calculations of this astute diplomatist.\nWhatever his weaknesses might be, cowardice was not one of them, and he\npursued his own aims boldly and relentlessly.\n\nBut he had had to endure a great deal through the personality and the\npresence of the Duke of Wessex: the humiliation put upon him this very\nafternoon by Mary Tudor still rankled deeply in his mind, and the vein\nof cruelty, almost inseparable from his nationality, rendered the\npresent situation peculiarly pleasing to this dissector of human hearts.\n\nUntil this moment he had perhaps not quite realized that His Grace of\nWessex had been hard hit. Having wilfully put away from his own life\nevery tender sentiment, he did not understand the quick rise of a great\nand whole-souled passion. The Duke had been ever noted for his\ngallantry, his chivalry, and his numerous and light amourettes, and the\nCardinal never imagined that in the daring game which he had planned,\nand which with the help of the wench Mirrab he was about to play, he\nwould have to reckon with something more serious than a passing\nflirtation.\n\nTo his feline disposition, his callous estimate of human nature, his\nreal hatred for this political rival, there was now a delicious\nsatisfaction in dealing a really mortal wound to the man for whose sake\nhe had oft been humiliated.\n\nHe felt a thrill of real and cruel delight in seeing this haughty\nEnglishman half broken under the strain of this mental torture, which\nhis slanderous words helped to aggravate. With half-closed eyes His\nEminence was watching the quiver of the proud lip, ever ready with\nlaughter and jest, the tremor of the slender hands, that peculiar\nstiffening of the whole figure which denotes a fierce struggle 'twixt\nraging passion and iron self-control. Was it not a joy to watch this\ngaping wound, into which he himself was pouring a deadly poison with a\nsteady and unerring hand?\n\nThe game had become doubly interesting now, and so much more important.\nThe Duke, obviously deeply in love with Lady Ursula, would certainly\nnever turn to another woman again. If the intrigue contrived by His\nEminence and the Marquis de Suarez succeeded in accordance with their\nexpectations, then not only would His Grace be parted from the lady in\naccordance with Queen Mary's ultimatum, but he would probably bury his\ndisillusionment and sorrow on some remote estate of his, far from Court\nand political strife.\n\nChance had indeed been kind to the envoys of the King of Spain.\n\nChance, and the natural sequence of events, skilfully guided by the\nCardinal's gentle hands.\n\nBut His Eminence was clever enough to know exactly how far he might dare\nventure. For the moment he certainly had said enough. The Duke seemed\npartly dazed and had altogether forgotten his presence.\n\nWithout a sound the Cardinal glided out of the room.\n\nThe closing of the door roused Wessex from the torpor into which he had\nfallen. The hall looked sombre and dreary, the wax tapers flickered\nfeebly in their sockets, whilst strange shadows seemed to jeer at him\nfrom the dark corners around. He would not look up at the gallery, the\nsteps whereon she stood, for it seemed to him as if some mocking witch\nwearing her face and her golden hair would look down at him from there,\nand laugh and sneer, until she finally faded from his sight in the arms\nof the Marquis de Suarez.\n\n\"Other vows and other lovers,\" he mused, whilst trying to shut away from\nhis eyes the hellish visions which tortured him. \"So my beautiful Fanny\nis not mine at all .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but the Spaniard's .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. or another's .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nwhat matter whose?

She found no one. The closet door was open; taking\none of the wax tapers in her hand she peeped into the inner room and saw\nthat it was empty.\n\nOn the fur rug, on the floor, was still the impress of Harry\nPlantagenet's body, as he had curled himself up patiently to wait and\nsleep.\n\nA sudden draught extinguished the taper and left the small room in total\ndarkness; to her overwrought nerves it seemed cold and lonely, like a\nnewly opened grave. Wessex had gone because he had heard that she had\ndeceived him. The slanders uttered against her had found credence in his\nheart. Thus she mused, guessing at the truth, perhaps not even realizing\nhow much he had suffered.\n\nShe would not go back to her room just yet. She knew that she could not\nrest. Though the room was empty there seemed something of him still in\nit, even in its cold and deserted aspect.\n\nShe lingered here, sitting in the chair where he had sat and heard. She\ncould not cry, she would not give way, for she wished to think.\nTherefore she lingered.\n\nThus fate worked its will in this strange history of that night.\n\nWessex did not know that she had returned. After the Cardinal had left\nhim he waited awhile, but he never guessed that she would come back. Had\nhe not heard that her kindest favours had been the Spaniard's, ere his\nnoble Grace had come across her path? With that almost morbid humility\nwhich is such a peculiar and inalienable characteristic of a great love,\nhe thought it quite natural that she should love Don Miguel, or any\nother man, rather than him, and now he was only too willing to suppose\nthat she had gone to her favoured gallant, leaving him in the ridiculous\nand painful position in which she had wantonly placed him.\n\nHe had waited in a desultory fashion, not really hoping that she would\ncome. Then, as silence began to fall more and more upon the Palace, and\nthe clock in the great tower boomed the midnight hour, he had finally\nturned his steps towards his own apartments.\n\nTo reach them he had to go along the cloisters, and traverse the great\naudience chamber, which lay between his suite of rooms and that occupied\nby the Cardinal de Moreno and Don Miguel de Suarez.\n\nAs he entered the vast room he was unpleasantly surprised to see the\nyoung Spaniard standing beside the distant window.\n\nThe lights had been put out, but the two enormous bays were open,\nletting in a flood of brilliant moonlight. The night was peculiarly\nbalmy and sweet, and through the window could be seen the exquisite\npanorama of the gardens and terraces of Hampton Court, with the river\nbeyond bathed in silvery light.\n\nWessex had paused at the door, his eyes riveted on that distant picture,\nwhich recalled so vividly to his aching senses the poetic idyll of this\nafternoon.\n\nIt was strange that Don Miguel should be standing just where he was,\nbetween him and that vision so full of memories now.\n\nWessex turned his eyes on the Marquis, who had not moved when he\nentered, and seemed absorbed in thought.\n\n\"And there is the man who before me has looked in Ursula's eyes,\" mused\nthe Duke. \"To think that I have a fancy for killing that young\nreprobate, because he happens to be more attractive than myself .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. or\nbecause .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHe suddenly tried to check his thoughts. They were beginning to riot in\nhis brain. Until this very moment, when he saw the Spaniard standing\nbefore him, he had not realized how much he hated him. All that is\nprimitive, passionate, semi-savage in man rose in him at the sight of\nhis rival. A wild desire seized him to grip that weakling by the throat,\nto make him quake and suffer, if only one thousandth part of the agony\nwhich had tortured him this past hour.\n\nHe deliberately crossed the room, then opened the door which led to his\nown apartments.\n\n\"Harry, old friend,\" he called to his dog, \"go, wait for me within. I\nhave no need for thy company just now.\"\n\nThe beautiful creature, with that peculiar unerring instinct of the\nfaithful beast, seemed quite reluctant to obey. He stopped short, wagged\nhis tail, indulged in all the tricks which he knew usually appealed to\nhis master, begging in silent and pathetic language to be allowed to\nremain. But Wessex was quite inexorable, and Harry Plantagenet had\nperforce to go.\n\nThe door closed upon the Duke's most devoted friend. In the meanwhile\nDon Miguel had evidently perceived His Grace, and now when Wessex turned\ntowards him he exclaimed half in surprise, half in tones of thinly\nveiled vexation--\n\n\"Ah! His Grace of Wessex? Still astir, my lord, at this hour?\"\n\n\"At your service, Marquis,\" rejoined the Duke coldly. \"Has His Eminence\ngone to his apartments? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Can I do aught for you?\"\n\n\"Nay, I thank Your Grace .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I thought you too had retired,\" stammered\nthe young man, now in visible embarrassment. \"I must confess I did not\nthink to see you here.\"\n\n\"Whom did you expect to see, then?\" queried Wessex curtly.\n\n\"Nay! methought Your Grace had said that questions could not be\nindiscreet.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Marry! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. your question this time, my lord .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Was indiscreet?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said the Spaniard deprecatingly.\n\n\"Which means that you expect a lady.\"\n\n\"Has Your Grace any objection to that?\" queried Don Miguel with thinly\nveiled sarcasm.\n\n\"None at all,\" replied Wessex, who felt his patience and self-control\noozing away from him bit by bit. \"I am not your guardian; yet, methinks,\nit ill becomes a guest of your rank to indulge in low amours beneath the\nroof of the Queen of England.\"\n\n\"Why should you call them low?\" rejoined the Marquis, whose manner\nbecame more and more calm and bland, as Wessex seemed to wax more\nviolent. \"You, of all men, my lord, should know that we, at Court, seek\nfor pleasure where we are most like to find it.\"\n\n\"Aye! and in finding the pleasure oft lose our honour.\"\n\n\"Your Grace is severe.\"\n\n\"If my words offend you, sir, I am at your service.\"\n\n\"Is this a quarrel?\"\n\n\"As you please.\"\n\n\"Your Grace .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Pardi, my lord Marquis,\" interrupted Wessex haughtily and in tones of\nwithering contempt, \"I did not know that there were any cowards among\nthe grandees of Spain.\"\n\n\"By Our Lady, Your Grace is going too far,\" retorted the Spaniard.\n\nAnd with a quick gesture he unsheathed his sword.\n\nWessex' eyes lighted up with the fire of satisfied desire. He knew now\nthat this was what he had longed for ever since the young man's insolent\nlaugh had first grated unpleasantly on his ear. For the moment all that\nwas tender and poetic and noble in him was relegated to the very\nbackground of his soul. He was only a human creature who suffered and\nwished to be revenged, an animal who was wounded and was seeking to\nkill. He would have blushed to own that what he longed for now, above\neverything on earth, was the sight of that man's blood.\n\n\"Nay, my lord!\" he said quietly, \"are we children to give one another a\npin-prick or so?\"\n\nAnd having drawn his sword, he unsheathed his long Italian dagger, and\nholding it in his left hand he quickly wrapped his cloak around that\narm.\n\n\"You are mad,\" protested Don Miguel with a frown, for a sword and dagger\nfight meant death to one man at least, and a mortal combat with one so\ndesperate as Wessex had not formed part of the programme so carefully\narranged by the Cardinal de Moreno.\n\n\"By the Mass, man,\" was the Duke's calm answer, \"art waiting to feel my\nglove on thy cheek?\"\n\n\"As you will, then,\" retorted Don Miguel, reluctantly drawing his own\ndagger, \"but I swear that this quarrel is none of my making.\"\n\n\"No! 'tis of mine! _en garde_!\"\n\nDon Miguel was pale to the lips. Not that he was a coward; he had fought\nmore than one serious duel before now, and risked his life often enough\nfor mere pastime or sport. But there was such a weird glitter in the\neyes of this man, whom he and his chief had so wantonly wronged for the\nsake of their own political advancement, such a cold determination to\nkill, that, much against his will, the Spaniard felt an icy shiver\nrunning down his spine.\n\nThe room too! half in darkness, with only the strange, almost unreal\nbrilliancy of the moon shedding a pallid light over one portion of the\nfloor, that portion where one man was to die.\n\nThe Marquis de Suarez had been provoked; his was therefore the right of\nselecting his own position for the combat. In the case of such a\npeculiar illumination this was a great initial advantage.\n\nThe Spaniard, with his back towards the great open bay, had his\nantagonist before him in full light, whilst his own figure appeared only\nas a dark silhouette, elusive and intensely deceptive. Wessex, however,\nseemed totally unconscious of the disadvantage of his own position. He\nwas still dressed in the rich white satin doublet in which he had\nappeared at the banquet a few hours ago. The broad ribbon of the Garter,\nthe delicate lace at the throat, the jewels which he wore, all would\nhelp in the brilliant light to guide his enemy's dagger towards his\nbreast.\n\nBut he seemed only impatient to begin; the issue, one way or the other,\nmattered to him not at all. The Spaniard's death or his own was all that\nhe desired:--perhaps his own now--for choice. He felt less bitter, less\nhumiliated since he held his sword in his hand, and only vaguely\nrecollected that Spaniards made a boast these days of carrying poisoned\ndaggers in their belts.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nTHE FIGHT\n\n\nWhilst Don Miguel was preparing for the fight, a slight sound suddenly\ncaused him to turn towards that side of the room, from whence a tall\noaken door led to his own and the Cardinal's apartments. His eyes,\nrendered peculiarly keen by the imminence of his own danger, quickly\nperceived a thin fillet of artificial light running upwards from the\nfloor, which at once suggested to him that the door was slightly ajar.\n\nIt had certainly been closed when Wessex first entered the room. Behind\nit, as Don Miguel well knew, the Cardinal de Moreno had been watching;\nhe was the great stage-manager of the drama which he had contrived\nshould be enacted this night before His Grace. The young Marquis was\nonly one of the chief actors; the principal actress being the wench\nMirrab, who, surfeited with wine, impatient and violent, had been kept a\nclose prisoner by His Eminence these last six hours past.\n\nThat little glimmer of light dispelled Don Miguel's strange obsession.\nThe Cardinal, with the slight opening of that door, had plainly meant to\nindicate that he was on the alert, and that this unrehearsed scene of\nthe drama would not be enacted without his interference. The Duke, who\nhad his back to that portion of the room, had evidently seen and heard\nnothing, and the whole little episode had occurred in less than three\nseconds.\n\nNow Don Miguel was ready, and the next moment the swords clashed\nagainst one another. Eye to eye these two enemies seemed to gauge one\nanother's strength. For a moment their daggers, held in the left hand,\nonly acted as weapons of defence, the cloaks wrapped round their arms\nwere still efficient sheaths.\n\nVery soon the Spaniard realized that his original fears had not been\nexaggerated. Wessex was a formidable opponent, absolutely calm, a\nskilful fencer, and with a wrist which seemed made of steel. His attack\nwas quick and vigorous; step by step, slowly but unerringly, he forced\nthe Marquis away from the stronghold of his position. Try how he might,\nparry how he could, the young Spaniard gradually found himself thrust\nmore and more into full light, whilst his antagonist was equally\nsteadily working his way round towards the more advantageous post.\n\nNo sound came from the Cardinal's apartments, and Don Miguel dared not\neven glance towards the door, for the swiftest look would have proved\nhis undoing.\n\nWessex' face was like a mask, quite impassive, almost stony in its rigid\nexpression of perfect determination. The Spaniard was still steadily\nlosing ground, another few minutes and he would be in full light, whilst\nthe Duke's figure would become the deceptive silhouette. Under those\nconditions, and against such a perfect swordsman, the Marquis knew that\nhis doom was sealed. An icy sweat broke out from his forehead, he would\nhave bartered half his fortune to know what was going on behind the\ndoor.\n\nFor one awful moment the thought crossed his mind that His Eminence\nperhaps had decreed his death at the hands of Wessex. Who knows? the\nways of diplomacy are oft tortuous and ever cruel; none knew that better\nthan Don Miguel de Suarez himself. How oft had he callously exercised\nthe right given him by virtue of some important mission entrusted to\nhim, in order to sweep ruthlessly aside the lesser pawns which stood in\nthe way of his success?\n\nHad he become the lesser pawn now in this gigantic game of chess, in\nwhich the hand of a Queen was the final prize for the victor? Was his\ndeath, at the hand of this man, of more importance to the success of the\nCardinal's intrigues than his life would be? If so, Heaven alone could\nhelp him, for His Eminence would not hesitate to sacrifice him\nmercilessly.\n\nThe horror of these thoughts gave the young man the strength of despair.\nBut he might just as well have tried to pierce a stone wall, as to break\nthe _garde_ of this impassive and deadly opponent. His own wrist was\nbeginning to tire; the combat had lasted nigh on a quarter of an hour,\nand the next few minutes would inevitably see its fatal issue. The\nDuke's attacks became more swift and violent; once or twice already Don\nMiguel had all but felt His Grace's dagger at his throat.\n\nSuddenly a piercing woman's shriek seemed to rend the air, the swift\nsound of running footsteps, the grating of a heavy door on its hinges,\nand then there came another cry, more definite this time--\n\n\"Wessex, have a care!\"\n\nBoth the men had paused, of course. Even in this supreme moment when one\nlife hung in the balance, how could they help turning towards the\ndistant corner of the room whence had come that piercing shriek.\n\nThe door leading to the Marquis' apartments was wide open now; a flood\nof light came from the room beyond, and against this sudden glare, which\nseemed doubly brilliant to the dazed eyes of the combatants, there\nappeared a woman's figure, dressed in long flowing robes of clinging\nwhite, her golden hair hanging in a wild tangle over her shoulders. A\nquaint and weird figure! at first only a silhouette against a glowing\nbackground, but anon it came forward, disappeared completely for a\nwhile in the dense shadow of an angle of the room, but the next moment\nemerged again in the full light of the moon, ghostlike and fantastic; a\ngirlish form, her white draperies half falling from her shoulders,\nrevealing a white throat and one naked breast; on her hair a few green\nleaves, bacchante-like entwined and drooping, half hidden in the tangle\nof ruddy gold.\n\nWessex gazed on her, his sword dropped from his hand.\n\nIt was she! She, as a hellish vision had shown her to him half an hour\nago, in the great room wherein he had first kissed her: a weird and\nwitchlike creature, with eyes half veiled, and coarsened, sensuous lips.\nIt was but a vision even now, for he could not see her very distinctly,\nhis eyes were dazed with the play of the moonlight upon his sword, and\nshe, after her second cry, had drawn back into the shadow.\n\nDon Miguel on the other hand had not seemed very surprised at her\napparition, only somewhat vexed, as he exclaimed--\n\n\"Lady Ursula, I pray you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHe placed his hand on her shoulder. It was the gesture of a master, and\nthe tone in which he spoke to her was one of command.\n\n\"I pray you go within,\" he added curtly; \"this is no place for women.\"\n\nWessex' whole soul writhed at the words, the touch, the attitude of the\nman towards her; an hour ago, when he stood beside her, he would have\nbartered a kingdom for the joy of taking her hand.\n\nShe seemed dazed, and her form swayed strangely to and fro; suddenly she\nappeared to be conscious of her garments, for with a certain shamed\nmovement of tardy modesty she pulled a part of her draperies over her\nbreast.\n\n\"I wish to speak with him,\" she whispered under her breath to Don\nMiguel.\n\nBut the Spaniard had no intention of prolonging this scene a second\nlonger than was necessary. It had from the first been agreed between him\nand the Cardinal that the Duke should not obtain more than a glimpse at\nthe wench. At any moment, after the first shock of surprise, Wessex\nmight look more calmly, more steadily at the girl. She might begin to\nspeak, and her voice--the hoarse voice of a gutter-bred girl--would\nbetray the deception more quickly than anything else. The one brief\nvision had been all-sufficient: Don Miguel was satisfied. It had been\nadmirably staged so far by the eminent manager who still remained out of\nsight, it was for the young man now to play his r\u00c3\u00b4le skilfully to the\nend.\n\n\"Come!\" he said peremptorily.\n\nHe seized the girl's wrist, whispered a few words in her ear which never\nreached her dull brain, and half led, half dragged her towards the door.\n\nWessex broke into a long, forced laugh, which expressed all the\nbitterness and anguish of his heart.\n\nOh! the humiliation of it all! Wessex suddenly felt that all his anger\nhad vanished. The whole thing was so contemptible, the banality of the\nepisode so low and degrading, that hatred fell away from him like a\nmantle, leaving in his soul a sense of unutterable disgust and even of\nabject ridicule. His pride alone was left to suffer. He who had always\nheld himself disdainfully aloof from all the low intrigues inseparable\nfrom Court life, who had kept within his heart a reverent feeling of\nchivalry and veneration for all women, whether queen or peasant,\nconstant or fickle, for him to have sunk to this! one of a trio of\nvulgar mountebanks, one of two aspirants for the favours of a wanton.\n\nOf trickery, of deception, he had not one thought. How could he have?\nThe events of the past hours had prepared him for this scene, and he had\nhad only a brief vision in semi-darkness, whilst everything had been\ncarefully prepared to blind him completely by this dastardly trick.\n\n\"By Our Lady,\" he said at last, with that same bitter, heartrending\nlaugh, \"the interruption was most opportune, and we must thank the Lady\nUrsula for her timely intervention. What! you and I, my lord, crossing\nswords for that?\" and he pointed with a gesture of unutterable scorn\ntowards the swaying figure of the woman. \"A farce, my lord, a farce! Not\na tragedy!\"\n\nHe threw his dagger on to the floor and sheathed his sword, just as Don\nMiguel had succeeded in pushing the girl out of the room and closing the\ndoor on her.\n\nThe Spaniard began to stammer an apology.\n\n\"I pray you speak no more of it, my lord,\" said the Duke coldly, \"'tis I\nowe you an apology for interfering in what doth not concern me. As His\nEminence very pertinently remarked just now, hospitality should forbid\nme to fly my hawk after your lordship's birds. My congratulations, my\nlord Marquis!\" he added with a sneer. \"Your taste, I perceive, is\nunerring. Good night and pleasant dreams.\"\n\nHe bowed lightly and turned to go.\n\nDon Miguel watched him until his tall figure had disappeared behind the\ndoor. Then he sighed a deep sigh of satisfaction.\n\n\"An admirably enacted comedy,\" he mused; \"a thousand congratulations to\nHis Eminence. Carramba! this is the best night's work we have\naccomplished since we trod this land of fogs.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nTHE SEQUEL OF THE COMEDY\n\n\nMirrab, during that very brief drama in which she herself had played the\nchief r\u00c3\u00b4le, had vainly tried to collect her scattered wits. For the last\nfew hours two noble gentlemen, one of whom wore gorgeous purple robes,\nhad been plying her with wine and with promises that she should see the\nDuke of Wessex if she agreed to answer to the name of \"Lady Ursula,\"\nseeing that His Grace never spoke to any one under the rank of a lady.\n\nA clever and simple trick, which readily deceived this uneducated,\nhalf-crazy wench, whose life had been spent in gipsy booths, and whose\nintellect had long been quashed by the constant struggle for existence,\nwhich mostly consisted of senseless and fantastic exhibitions designed\nfor the delectation of ignorant yokels.\n\nShe liked the idea of being called \"my lady\" even when it was done in\nmockery, and was delighted at the thought of appearing in this new guise\nbefore the Duke of Wessex, for whom she had entertained a curious and\npassionate adoration ever since the dramatic episode of Molesey Fair.\nShe liked still more the voluptuous garments which she was bidden to\ndon, and was ready enough to concede to the young foreigner who thus\nembellished her, any favours which he chose to demand.\n\nThat had been her training, poor soul! her calling in life--a vulgar\ntrickster by day, a wanton by night. Do not be too hard in your\njudgment, mistress! she knew nothing of home, very little of kindred;\nborn in the gutter, her ambition did not soar beyond good food and a\nlittle money to spend.\n\nThe Duke of Wessex had saved her life; she was proud of that, and since\nthat day she had had a burning ambition to see him again. She had hoped\nthat a warning from the stars would prove a certain passport to his\npresence, but His Eminence the Cardinal and the other young gentleman\nhad assured her that a noble name would alone lead her to him.\n\nThus she had been content to wait a few hours: the wine was good and the\nforeigner not too exacting. After awhile she had dropped to sleep like\nsome tired animal, curled up on a rug on the floor. The clash of arms\nhad roused her, and finding that every door yielded to her touch, she\nran out, in eager curiosity to see whence came the sound. Her first cry,\non seeing that strange moonlit combat, was one of sheer terror; then she\nrecognized Wessex, and gave him a cry of warning.\n\nBut the wine which she had drunk had made her head heavy. She would have\nliked to go to the Duke, but the room seemed to be whirling unpleasantly\naround her. Ere she had time to utter another word the young foreigner\nhad roughly seized her wrist and dragged her away. She was too weak to\nresist him, and was reluctantly compelled to follow his lead. The next\nmoment he had closed the door on her, and she knew nothing more.\n\nExcitement had somewhat dazed her, but a moment or two later she\npartially recovered and collected her scattered senses. She put her ear\nto the door and tried to listen, but she could hear nothing. Behind her\nwas the corridor, out of which opened several doors, one of these being\nthe one which gave into the room wherein she had been confined the whole\nevening. Not a sound came from there either. There was not a sign of my\nlord Cardinal.\n\nOnce more she tried the handle of the big door in front of her: it\nyielded, and she found herself back in the room where the fight had just\ntaken place. The moonlight still streamed in through the open window.\nShe could not see into the corners of the great hall, but straight in\nfront of her was another massive door, exactly similar to the one in\nwhich she stood.\n\nThe room itself seemed empty. Wessex had gone, and she had not spoken to\nhim. That was the one great thought which detached itself from the\nturmoil which was going on in her brain. The door opposite fascinated\nher. Perhaps he had gone through there. Nay! surely so, for it almost\nseemed to her as if she could hear that strange, bitter laugh of his\nstill echoing in the distance.\n\nShe ran across the room, fearful lest he should disappear altogether ere\nshe could get to him. But even before she reached the door she felt her\narm seized, her body dragged violently back. By the light of the moon,\nwhich fell full on him, she recognized the young foreign lord.\n\nHe had summarily placed himself before her, and he held her wrist in a\ntight grip.\n\n\"Let me go!\" she murmured hoarsely.\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"I _will_ go to him!\"\n\n\"You cannot!\"\n\nHe spoke from between his teeth, as if in a fury of rage or fear, she\ncould not tell which, but as she, poor soul, had never inspired terror\nin any one she quaked before his rage.\n\nJust then she heard, as if in the room beyond, a few footsteps, then a\ncall: \"Come, Harry!\" and after that the opening and shutting of a\ndistant door. It was the Duke of Wessex going again, somewhere where\nperhaps she could not find him again, and here was this man standing\nbetween her and the object of her adoration.\n\nWith a vigorous jerk she freed herself from Don Miguel's grasp.\n\n\"Have a care, man, have a care,\" she said in a low, trembling voice, in\nwhich a suppressed passion seemed suddenly to vibrate. \"Let me pass, or\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Silence, wench!\" commanded Don Miguel. \"Another word and I call the\nguard and have thee whipped as a disturber of the peace.\"\n\nShe started as if stung with the very lash with which he so callously\nthreatened her. The fumes of wine and of excitement were being slowly\nexpelled from her dull brain. A vague sense of bitter wrong crept into\nher heart; her own native shrewdness--the shrewdness of the country\nwench--made her dimly realize that she had been fooled: how and for what\npurpose she could not yet comprehend.\n\nShe pushed the tangled hair from her forehead, mechanically readjusting\nher cumbersome garments, then she stepped close up to the young\nSpaniard; she crossed her arms over her breast and looked him boldly in\nthe eyes.\n\n\"Soho! my fine lord!\" she said, speaking with a strange and pathetic\neffort at calmness, \"that's it, is it? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and do ye take me for a\nfool, that I do not see through your tricks? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. You and that\npurple-robed hypocrite there wanted to make use of me .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you cajoled\nme with soft words .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. promises .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. what? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Bah! you tricked me,\nI say, do you hear?\" she added with ever-increasing vehemence, \"tricked\nme that you might trick him. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. With all your talks of Ursula and\nLady .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. the devil alone knows what ye wanted. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Well! you've had\nyour way .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. he looked on me as he would on a plague-stricken cur\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. mangy and dirty. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Was that what ye wanted? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. You've had\nyour will .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. are ye satisfied .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. what more do ye want of me?\"\n\nDon Miguel, much astonished at this unexpected outburst of passion,\ngazed at her with a sneer, then he shrugged his shoulders and said\ncoldly--\n\n\"Nothing, wench! His Grace of Wessex does not desire thy company, and I\ncannot allow thee to molest him. If thou'lt depart in peace, there'll be\na well-filled purse for thee .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. if not .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. the whip, my girl .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nthe whip .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. understand!\"\n\n\"I will not go!\" she repeated with dogged obstinacy. \"I'll not .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nI'll not .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I'll see him just once .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. he was good to me. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I\nlove his beautiful face and his kind, white hands; I want to kiss them.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I'll not go .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I'll not .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. till I've kissed them. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. So\ndo not stand in my way, fine sir .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but let me get to him. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nThe obstinate desire, half a mania now, had grown upon her with this\nwanton thwarting of her wishes. A wholly unfettered passion seethed in\nher, half made up of hatred against this man who had fooled her and\ncaused her to be spurned with unutterable contempt by Wessex.\n\n\"I'll give thee three minutes in which to get sober, my wench!\" remarked\nDon Miguel placidly. \"After that, take heed. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHe laughed a long, cruel laugh, and looked at her with an evil leer, up\nand down.\n\n\"After that thou'lt go,\" he said slowly and significantly, \"but not in\npeace. The Palace watch have a heavy hand .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. three men to give thee\nten lashes each .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. till thy shoulders bleed, wench .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. aye! I'll\nhave thee whipped till thou die under it .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. so go now or .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHe looked so evil, so threatening, so full of baffled rage, that\ninstinctively she drew back a few steps away from him, into the gloom.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. As she did so her foot knocked against something on the floor,\nwhilst the sharp point of some instrument of steel penetrated through\nthe thin soles of her shoes.\n\nShe had enough presence of mind, enough determination, enough deadly\nhatred of him, not to give forth one sound; but when he, almost overcome\nwith his own furious passion, had paused awhile and turned from her, she\nstooped very quickly and picked up that thing which had struck her foot.\nIt was an unsheathed dagger.\n\nSilently, surreptitiously, she hid it within the folds of her gown,\nwhilst keeping a tight grip on its handle with her clenched right hand.\nNow she felt safe, and sure of herself and of ultimate success.\n\nDon Miguel, seeing how quiet she had become, heaved a sigh of relief.\nFor one moment he had had the fear that she meant to create a scandal,\nattract the guard with her screams, bring spectators upon the scene, and\nthus expose the whole despicable intrigue which had just been so\nsuccessfully carried through.\n\nBut now she was standing quite rigid and mute, half hidden by the gloom,\nevidently terrorized by the cruel threats hurled against her.\n\n\"Well, which is it to be, wench,\" said the young man more calmly, \"the\npurse of gold or the whipping-post?\"\n\nShe did not reply at once, and a strange, almost awesome silence fell\nupon the scene. Not a sound from any portion of the Palace. Even from\nthe gardens and terraces, beyond the night watchman's call had ceased to\necho, only from far, very far away beyond the river and the distant\nmeadows the melancholy hooting of an owl broke the intense stillness of\nthe place.\n\nThen the woman began to speak, slowly at first, very calmly, and in a\nvoice deep and low, like the sound of muffled thunder, growing louder\nand louder, more violent, more passionate as she worked herself up into\na very whirlwind of fury.\n\n\"Powers of Hell!\" she said, \"grant me patience! Man, listen. Ye don't\nunderstand me. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I am not one of your fine Court ladies, who simpers\nand trips along arrayed in silken kirtle. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I am called Mirrab, a\nwitch, d'ye hear? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. a witch who knows naught about the law, and the\nguard, nor about queens and richly dressed lords. The Duke of Wessex\nsaved my life .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and I want to go to him. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Do ye let me go.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. What is it to ye if I see him? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Do ye let me go. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHer voice broke into a sob of agonized entreaty and baffled desire.\n\n\"Shall I call the guard?\" rejoined Don Miguel coldly.\n\nShe was now quite close to him, he, still between her and the door which\nshe wished to reach, was half turned away from her, in obvious\nimpatience, and looking at her over his shoulder with a sneer and a\ncruel frown.\n\n\"Do ye let me go!\" she entreated once more.\n\nFor sole answer he made pretence at calling the guard.\n\n\"What ho there! the guard! What ho!\"\n\nBut the last sound broke in a death rattle. Even as he spoke Mirrab had\nthrust the dagger with all her might between his shoulders. He fell\nforward on the floor, whilst with one last gasp of agony he called upon\nthe man whom he had so deeply wronged.\n\n\"A moi! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Wessex! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I die! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. A moi! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nAnd the silvery moon, who had just gazed on so placidly whilst human\npassions ran riot in this vast audience chamber, who had shed her poetic\nlight on hatred, revenge, and lust, suddenly veiled her brilliant face:\nthe room was plunged in total darkness as the Marquis de Suarez breathed\nhis last.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nCHECK-MATE\n\n\nFor some time already there had been a certain amount of commotion in\nthe Palace. Mirrab's shouts when first she saw the combat, then her\nhigh-voiced altercation with Don Miguel, had roused the attention of\nsome of the guard who were stationed in the cloister green court close\nby. Some of the gentlemen too were astir.\n\nWessex himself soon after he had reached his own apartments heard the\nsound of angry voices proceeding from the room which he had just\nquitted. He could hear nothing distinctly, but it seemed to him as if a\nwoman and a man were quarrelling violently. He tried to shut his ears to\nthe sound. He would hear nothing, know nothing more of the wanton who\nhad fooled and mocked him.\n\nBut there are certain instincts in every chivalrous man, which will not\nbe gainsaid; among these is the impulse to go at once to the assistance\nof a woman if she be in trouble or difficulty.\n\nIt was that impulse and nothing more which caused Wessex to retrace his\nfootsteps. He had some difficulty in finding his way, now that there was\nno moonlight to guide him, but as soon as he re-entered the last room,\nwhich was next to the audience chamber, he heard the ominous \"A moi!\" of\nhis dying opponent. Also all round him the obvious commotion of a number\nof footsteps all tending towards the same direction.\n\nAn icy horror suddenly gripped his heart. Not daring to imagine what had\noccurred, he hurried on. By instinct, for he could see nothing, he\ncontrived to find and open the door, and still going forward he\npresently stumbled against something which lay heavy and inert at his\nfeet.\n\nIn a moment he was on his knees, touching the prostrate body with a\ngentle hand; realizing that the unfortunate young man had fallen on his\nface, he tried with infinite care to lift and turn him as tenderly as he\ncould.\n\nThen suddenly he became conscious of another presence in the room.\nNothing more than a ghostlike form of white, almost as rigid as the\nmurdered man himself, whilst from the corridors close by the sound of\napproaching footsteps, still hesitating which way to go, became more and\nmore distinct. A murmur of distant voices too gradually took on a\ndefinite sound.\n\n\"This way.\"\n\n\"No, that.\"\n\n\"In the court .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"No! the audience chamber!\"\n\nThe ghostly white-clad figure appeared as if turned to stone.\n\n\"Through the window,\" whispered Wessex with sudden vehemence, \"it is not\nhigh!--quick! fly, in the name of God! while there's yet time!\"\n\nThat was his only instinct now. He could not think of her as the woman\nhe had loved, he understood nothing, knew nothing; but in the intense\ngloom which surrounded him he had lost sight of the witchlike and\nhorrible vision which had dealt a death-blow to his love, he seemed only\nto see the green bosquets of the park, the pond, the marguerites, and\nanother white-clad figure, a girlish face crowned with the golden halo\nof purity and innocence.\n\nThe wild passion which he had felt for her changed to an agonizing\nhorror, not only of her deed, but at the thought of seeing her\nsurrounded, rough-handled by the guard, shamed and treated as a mad and\ndrunken wanton.\n\nHe despised himself for his own weakness, but at this awful and supreme\nmoment, when he realized that the idol which he had set up and\nworshipped was nothing but defiled mud, he felt for her only tenderness\nand pity.\n\nLove had touched him once, and he knew now that nothing would ever tear\nher image completely from out his heart. Love, great, ardent, immutable,\nwas dead; but death is oft more powerful than life, and his dead love\npleaded for his chivalry, for his protection, with all the power of\nsweet memories, and aided by the agonizing grip of cold, stiff hands\nclinging to his heartstrings.\n\nHe pointed once more to the open window.\n\n\"Quick! in God's name!\"\n\nThe girl moved towards him.\n\n\"Ah no, no, for pity's sake. Go!\"\n\nThere was not a second to be lost. Mirrab, realizing her danger, was\nsobered and alert. The next moment she was clinging to the window-sill\nand measuring its height from the terrace below. It was but a few feet.\nAs agile as a cat she flung herself over, and disappeared into the gloom\njust as the door leading into the audience chamber was thrown violently\nopen, and a group of people--gentlemen, guard, servitors--bearing\ntorches came rushing into the room.\n\n\"Water! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. a leech!--quick, some of you!\" commanded Wessex, who held\nDon Miguel's head propped against his knee.\n\n\"What is it? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" queried every one with unanimous breath.\n\nSome pressed forward, snatching the flaming torches from the hands of\nthe servitors. In a moment Wessex and the dead Marquis were surrounded,\nand the room flooded with weird, flickering light.\n\nFrom the door of the apartments on the left a suave and urbane voice had\nsounded softly--\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"The Spanish Marquis,\" murmured the foremost man in the crowd.\n\n\"Wounded?\" queried another.\n\n\"Nay! I fear me dead,\" said Wessex quietly.\n\nThen the groups parted instinctively, for the same urbane voice had\nrepeated its query in tones of the gravest anxiety.\n\n\"I was at prayers, and heard this noise. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. What is it?\"\n\nThe Cardinal de Moreno now stood beside the dead body of his friend.\n\n\"Your Grace! and? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Alas, Your Eminence!\" replied Wessex, \"Don Miguel de Suarez is dead.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Alas, Your Eminence! Don Miguel de Suarez is dead.\"]\n\nThe Cardinal made no comment, and the next moment was seen to stoop and\npick up something from the ground.\n\n\"But how?\" queried one of the gentlemen.\n\n\"A duel?\" added another.\n\n\"No, not a duel, seemingly,\" said His Eminence softly. \"Don Miguel's\nsword and dagger are both sheathed.\"\n\nHe turned to the captain of the guard, who was standing close beside\nhim.\n\n\"Will this dagger explain the mystery, think you, my son?\" he asked,\nhanding a small weapon to the soldier. \"I picked it up just now.\"\n\nThe guard--he was but a young man--took the dagger from His Eminence's\nhand, and looked at it attentively. Those who were nearest to him\nnoticed that he suddenly started, and that the hand which held the\nnarrow pointed blade trembled visibly.\n\n\"Your Grace's dagger!\" he said at last, handing the weapon to Wessex.\n\"It has Your Grace's arms upon the hilt.\"\n\nDead silence followed these simple words. The Duke seemed half dazed,\nand mechanically took the dagger from the captain's hand; the blade\nstill bore on it the marks of Don Miguel's blood.\n\n\"Yes! it is my dagger,\" he murmured mechanically.\n\n\"But no doubt Your Grace can explain .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" suggested His Eminence\nindulgently.\n\nWessex was about to reply when one of the guard suddenly interposed.\n\n\"I seemed to see a woman flying through the gardens just now, captain,\"\nhe said, addressing his officer.\n\n\"A woman?\" asked His Eminence. \"What woman?\"\n\n\"Nay, my lord, I couldn't see distinctly,\" replied the soldier, \"but she\nwas dressed all in white, and ran very quickly along the terrace not far\nfrom this window.\"\n\n\"Then Your Grace will perhaps be able to tell us .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" suggested the\nCardinal with utmost benevolence.\n\n\"I can tell Your Eminence nothing,\" replied Wessex coldly. \"I was in\nthis room all the time and saw no woman near.\"\n\n\"Your Grace was here?\" said His Eminence in gentle tones of profound\nastonishment, \"alone with Don Miguel de Suarez? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. The woman .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"There was no woman here,\" rejoined the Duke of Wessex firmly, \"and I\nwas alone with Don Miguel de Suarez.\"\n\nThere was dead silence now, the moon, pale, inquisitive, brilliant,\npeeped in through the window to see what was amiss. She saw a number of\nmen recoiling, awestruck, from a small group composed of a dead man and\nof the first gentleman in the land self-confessed as a murderer. No one\ndared to speak, the moment was too solemn, too terrible, for any speech\nsave a half-smothered sigh of horror.\n\nThe captain of the guard was the first to recollect his duty.\n\n\"Your Grace's sword .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" he began, somewhat shamefacedly.\n\n\"Ah yes! I had forgot,\" said Wessex quietly, as he rose to his feet. He\ndrew his sword from its sheath, and with one quick, sudden wrench, broke\nthe blade across his knee. Then he threw the pieces of steel on the\nground.\n\n\"I am ready to follow you, friend captain,\" he said, with all the\nhauteur, all the light, easy graciousness so peculiar to himself.\n\nThe groups parted silently, almost respectfully, as His Grace of Wessex\npassed out of the room--a prisoner.\n\n\n\n\nPART IV\n\nHIS GRACE OF WESSEX\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nTHOUGHTS\n\n\nIn the loneliness and silence of the Tower, the Duke of Wessex had had\nenough leisure to think.\n\nOne fatal autumn afternoon, and what a change in the destinies of his\nlife! Yesterday he was the first gentleman in England, loved by many,\nfeared by a few, reverenced by all as the perfect embodiment of national\npride and national grandeur--almost a king.\n\nAnd to-day?\n\nBut of himself, his own obvious fate, the shame and disgrace of his\npresent position, he thought very little. Ever an easy-going\nphilosopher, he had as yet kept the insouciance of the gamester who has\nstaked and lost and is content to retire from the board. One thing more,\nremember! Life in those days was not the priceless treasure which later\ncivilization would have us believe it. There was a greater simplicity of\nfaith, a more childlike certitude in the great truths of futurity, which\nwe in our epoch are so ready to cavil at.\n\nIf nations and individuals committed excesses of unparalleled cruelty in\nthe name of their respective creeds, if men hated each other, tortured\neach other, destroyed one another, it was because they misunderstood the\nteachings of religion, and not because they ignored or disbelieved them.\n\nThe cruelties themselves are unjustifiable, the mind of\ntwentieth-century civilization can but gaze at them in mute horror,\nhistory can but record and deplore. But the religion which prompted\nthem--for it was religion--was not the feeble, an\u00c3\u00a6mic plaything of an\neffete generation in search of new excitements; it was strong and\nvirile, alike in the atrocity of its crimes and the sublimity of its\nvirtues.\n\nThus with a man like Wessex. Life had been pleasant, of course, a bed of\nroses worthy even of one of our modern sybarites, but to him only the\nepisode, which higher thoughts and Christian belief have ever suggested\nthat it should be.\n\nPerhaps it would be too much to say that faith alone caused him to look\nlightly upon this sudden, tragic ending of his brilliant career, but it\nundoubtedly helped him to preserve that easy and unembittered frame of\nmind of the philosopher, who, with life, loses that which hath but\nlittle value.\n\nAnd now indeed, what worth would life have for him? This is where\nthoughts became bitter and cruel, not over death, not over disgrace, but\nover the treachery of a woman and the flight of an illusion. What did it\nall mean?\n\nSometimes now, when he sat looking straight before him at the cold grey\nwalls of his prison, he seemed to see that strange dual personality\nmocking him with all the witchlike elusiveness which had mystified and\ntortured him from the first.\n\nHis \"Fanny\"! that beautiful vision of innocent girlhood; arch,\ncoquettish, tender yet passionate, the clear depths of those blue eyes,\nthe purity of that radiant smile!\n\nAnd then she! Ursula Glynde! with bare shoulder and breast, cheeks\nflushed, but not with shame, eyes moist, yet not with tears, submitting\nwith feeble, hoarse protests to the masterful touch of an insolent\nSpaniard, only to take revenge later with the elemental barbarity of the\nstreet wench, too drunk to understand her crime.\n\nEvery fibre within him cried out that this was not the woman who had\nplucked a marguerite petal by petal, and quivered with delight at sound\nof the nightingale's voice among the willows; not the woman on whose\nsoft girlish cheeks he had loved to call forth, with an ardent gaze or a\nbold word, a tender blush of rosy red, not the woman whom in one brief\nsecond he had learnt to love, whom in one mad, heavenly moment he had\nkissed.\n\nEvery sense in him clamoured for the belief that it had all been an ugly\ndream, an autumn madness from which he would presently wake at her feet.\n\nEvery sense! yet his eyes had seen her! his ears had heard her respond\nto her name, when uttered roughly by the man who seemed to be her\nmaster.\n\nThe truth itself never once dawned upon him. The whole trick had been\nmanaged with such devilish cunning, every piece in the intricate\nmechanism of that intrigue had been so carefully adjusted, that it would\nhave required superhuman insight, or the cold, calculating mind of an\nunemotional mathematician, to have hit upon its natural explanation.\n\nWessex possessed neither. He was just a man touched for the first time\nin his life with the strongest passion of which human creatures are\ncapable. He loved a woman with all the ardour, all the unreasoning\ninstincts, all the sublime weakness and folly of which a loyal and\nstrong heart is capable. That woman had proved a liar and a wanton in\nhis sight.\n\nHe was forced to believe that; had he not seen her? Which of us hath\never really grasped the fact that one human being may be fashioned line\nfor line, feature for feature, exactly like another? Yet such a thing\nis. Nature hath every freak. Why not that one?\n\nHe thought of everything, of every solution, of every possibility.\nHeaven help him! of every excuse, but never of that. That Nature, in one\nof those wayward moods in which no one would dare deny that she at\ntimes indulges, had fashioned a kitchen wench as a lifelike replica of\none of the most beautiful women in England--that one simple,\nindisputable, easily verified fact, never once entered his tortured\nmind.\n\nShe was mad! yes!--irresponsible for her own actions, yes!--wilfully\nwanton! no! a thousand times no! Hers was a dual nature, wherein angels\nand devils alternately held sway!\n\nHe, poor fool, had fallen under the spell of the angels, and the devils\nhad then turned him away from his shrine, shattered his illusions, shown\nhim his idol's feet of clay, then dared him ever to worship again, ever\nto forget the mud which cloyed the bottom of the limpid stream.\n\nWith Harry Plantagenet for sole companion, during the brief days which\npreceded his trial, Wessex had indeed leisure for his thoughts. The\nfaithful animal knew quite well that his master suffered and could not\nnow be comforted, but he would sit for hours with his wise head resting\non Wessex' knee, his gentle eyes fixed in mute sympathy upon the grave\nface of the Duke.\n\nHe knew better than any one that his master was in serious trouble, for\nwhen they were alone together, when no one was there who could see, no\none but this true and silent companion, then philosophy, pride, and\nbitterness would fly to the winds and a few hot tears would ease the\noppression which made Wessex' heart ache almost to breaking.\n\nAnd Harry Plantagenet, when he saw those tears, would curl himself up\nand go to sleep. With his keen, canine instinct, he felt no doubt only\nthat an atmosphere of peace and rest had descended on the gloomy Tower\nprison.\n\nThe faithful creature could not understand that it was the visit of the\nangel of sorrow, who, in passing, had lulled a weary man's agonizing\nsoul with the gentle, soothing touch of his wing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nMARYE, THE QUEENE\n\n\nThus day followed day, whilst in the great world without, England was\npreparing to see her premier lord arraigned before his peers on a charge\nof murder. And in one of the smaller chambers of her own private\napartments at Hampton Court, Mary Tudor sat alone, praying and thinking,\nthinking and praying again.\n\nNot a queen now, not a proud and wilful Tudor, passionate, cruel, or\ncapricious, but only a middle-aged, broken-hearted woman, with eyes\nswollen with weeping, and brain heavy with eternally reiterated desires.\n\nTo save him! to save him!\n\nBut how?\n\nThat he had committed so foul a crime as to stab an enemy in the back,\nthis in the very face of his own confession Mary still obstinately\nrefused to believe. The rumours anent the presence of a woman in that\npart of the Palace and at that fatal hour had of course reached her\nears. Jealousy and hatred, which had raged within her, had readily\nfastened on Ursula Glynde as the cause, if not the actual perpetrator of\nthe dastardly crime.\n\nThat a woman was somehow or other connected with the terrible events of\nthat night, every one was of course ready to admit, but in what manner\nno one was able to conjecture.\n\nA murder had been committed. Of that there could be no doubt. Don Miguel\nde Suarez had been stabbed in the back! Not in fair fight, but\nbrutally, callously stabbed! and he a guest at the English Court!\n\nOf this barbarous, abominable act the Duke of Wessex stood\nself-convicted.\n\nImpossible, of course! Preposterous! pronounced his friends. He! the\nfirst gentleman in England, brave to a fault, fastidious, artistic, and\na perfect swordsman to boot! The very accusation was ridiculous.\n\nYet he stood self-convicted.\n\nWhy? in the name of Heaven! Why?\n\n\"To shield a woman,\" said His Grace's friends.\n\n\"What woman?\" retorted his enemies.\n\nThe name of Lady Ursula Glynde had been faintly whispered, yet it seemed\nalmost as preposterous to suppose that a beautiful young girl--refined,\ngentle, poetic, scarce out of her teens--would have the physical\nstrength to commit so foul a deed, as to think of His Grace in\nconnection with it.\n\nYet, in spite of that, the idea had gained ground, that the Lady Ursula\nGlynde could, an she would, throw some light on the mystery which\nsurrounded the events of that terrible night, and no one brooded over\nthat idea more determinedly than did Mary Tudor.\n\nThe young girl had of course denied all knowledge of what had or had not\noccurred. There was not a single definite fact that might even remotely\nconnect her with the supposed enmity between Wessex and Don Miguel.\n\nThe Cardinal was not likely to speak, for the present turn of events\nsuited his own plans to perfection.\n\nMy lord of Everingham was away in Scotland, and news travelled slowly\nthese days. As for the Queen, she had nothing on which to found her\nsuspicions, save her own hatred of the girl and the firm conviction that\non that same night, an hour or two before the murder, Ursula and Wessex\nhad met. She had then seen and upbraided the girl in the presence of my\nlord Cardinal and the ladies; His Grace was not there then, but what\nhappened immediately afterwards?\n\nHad she but dared, Mary Tudor would have submitted her rival to mental\nand bodily torture, until she had extracted a confession from her. All\nshe could do was to confine her to her own room in the Palace; she would\nnot lose sight of her, although the young girl had begged for permission\nto quit the Court and retire to a convent, for the silence and peace of\nwhich she felt an unutterable longing.\n\nThe Duke's trial by his peers was fixed for the morrow.\n\nIt was but a fortnight since that fateful evening. His Grace had been in\nthe Tower since then, and by virtue of his high influence and of his\nexceptional position had demanded and readily obtained a speedy trial.\n\nTwenty-four hours in which a queen might perchance still save the man\nshe loved from a shameful and ignominious death. And she had thought and\nschemed and suffered during fourteen days, as perhaps no other woman had\never thought and suffered before. She was queen, yet felt herself\npowerless to accomplish the one desire of her life, which she would have\nbartered her kingdom to obtain: the life of the man she loved.\n\nBut to-day she had pluckily dried her tears. The whole morning she had\nspent at her toilette, carefully selecting--with an agitation which\nwould have been ridiculous, considering her age and appearance, had it\nnot been so intensely pathetic--the raiment which she thought would\nbecome her most. She had a burning desire to appear attractive.\n\nEarnestly she studied the lines of her face, covered incipient wrinkles\nand faded cheeks with cosmetics, spent nigh on an hour in the\narrangement of her coif. Then she repaired to a small room, which was\nhung with tapestry of a dull red, and into which the fading afternoon\nlight would only peep very gently and discreetly.\n\nSince then she had paced that narrow room incessantly and impatiently.\nEvery few moments she rang a handbell, and to the stolid page or\nservitor in attendance she repeated the same anxious query--\n\n\"Is the guard in sight yet?\"\n\n\"Not yet, Your Majesty,\" reiterated the page for the tenth time that\nday.\n\nIt was nigh on three o'clock in the afternoon when the Duchess of\nLincoln at last came with the welcome news.\n\n\"The captain of the guard desires to report to Your Majesty that the\nTower Guard, with His Grace the Duke of Wessex, are at the gates of the\nPalace.\"\n\nMary, with her usual characteristic gesture, pressed her hand to her\nheart, unable to speak with the sudden emotion which had sent the blood\nthrobbing in her veins. The kind old Duchess, her wrinkled face\nexpressive of the deepest sorrow and the most respectful sympathy,\nwaited patiently until the Queen had recovered herself.\n\n\"'Tis well,\" said Mary, after a while. \"I pray you, Duchess, to see that\nHis Grace is introduced in here at once.\"\n\nWhen she was alone she fell upon her knees, a great sob shook her\ndelicate frame. She took her rosary from her girdle and with passionate\nfervour kissed the jewelled beads.\n\n\"Holy Mary, Mother of God!\" she murmured amidst her tears, \"make him\nlisten to me! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. pray for me .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. intercede for me, Queen of Heaven,\nmystic rose, tower of ivory, holy virgin, our mother .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. pray for me\nnow .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I would save him, and I would make him King. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Queen of\nHeaven, aid me .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Mother of God, make him to love me .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. make him\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. to love me! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nAfter that she rose, and carefully wiped her tears. She cast a glance\nat a small mirror which stood on the table, smoothed her hair and coif\nand forced her lips to smile.\n\nThe next moment there was a knock at the door, a clash of arms, the\nsound of voices, and two minutes later His Grace of Wessex was in the\npresence of the Queen.\n\nShe held out her hand to him and he stooped to kiss it. This gave her\ntime to recover outward composure. Her fond heart ached at sight of him,\nfor he seemed so altered. All the gaiety, the joy of life, that buoyancy\nof youth and ever-ready laughter which had always been his own peculiar\ncharm, had completely gone from him: he looked older too, she thought,\nwhilst his step even had lost its elasticity.\n\nMary motioned him to a seat close beside her. She herself had wisely\nchosen so to place her chair that the light from the window, whilst\nfalling full on him, left her own figure in shadow.\n\n\"I trust, my lord,\" she began with a trembling voice, \"that my guard at\nthe Tower are showing you all the deference and doing you all the honour\nwhich I have commanded, and that your every comfort in that abode of\nevil hath been well looked to?\"\n\n\"Your Majesty is ever gracious,\" replied Wessex, \"far more than I\ndeserve. The kindness shown me by every one at the Tower hath been a\nsource of the deepest happiness to me.\"\n\n\"Nay! if I could .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" began Mary impulsively.\n\nThen she checked herself, determined not to let emotion get the better\nof her, ere she had told him all that she wished to say.\n\n\"My lord of Wessex,\" she resumed more firmly, \"will you try to think\nthat you are before a sincere and devoted friend; not before your Queen,\nbut beside a woman who hath naught so much at heart as .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. your\nhappiness? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Will you try?\"\n\n\"The effort will not be great,\" he replied with a smile. \"Your Majesty's\nkindness hath oft shamed me ere this.\"\n\n\"Then, if you value my friendship, my lord,\" rejoined Mary vehemently,\n\"give me some assurance that to-morrow, before your judges and your\npeers, you will refute this odious charge which is brought against you.\"\n\n\"I crave Your Majesty's most humble pardon,\" said Wessex. \"I have made\nconfession of the crime imputed to me and can refute nothing.\"\n\n\"Nay, my lord, this is madness. You, the most gallant gentleman in\nEngland, you, to have done a deed so foul as would shame the lowest\nchurl! Bah!\" she added, with a bitter laugh, \"'twere a grim farce, if it\nwere not so terrible a tragedy!\"\n\n\"Nay! not a tragedy, Your Majesty. Better men than I have made a failure\nof their lives. So I pray you, think no more of me.\"\n\n\"Think no more of you, dear lord,\" said Mary, with an infinity of\nreproach in her voice. \"Ah me, I think of naught else since that awful\nnight when they came and told me that you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nThere was a catch in her throat and perforce she had to pause. Oh! the\nirony of fate! The bitter satire of that wanton god, called Love!\n\nWessex looked at this proud Tudor Queen with a deep reverence, in which\nthere was almost a thought of pity. This lonely, middle-aged woman,\npassionate, self-willed, who loved him with all the tenderness of\npent-up motherhood! yet, try how he might! he could only respond to her\ntrue affection with cold respect and deep but unimpassioned gratitude!\nYet was not her worth ten thousandfold more great than that of the\nwanton, whose image still filled his heart?\n\nThe one woman he honoured, the other he must perforce despise, and\nyet--such is the heart of man--he was more ready than ever to give up\nlife, honour, a great name, and still greater destiny, so that the\nworthless object of his whole-hearted affection should be spared public\ndisgrace.\n\nHe would not have named Ursula Glynde in this chaste, virgin Queen's\npresence, the very remembrance of that awful night was a pollution, but\nproud and haughty as he was, he dwelt on that memory, for it was the\nlast which he had of her.\n\nMad, foolish, criminal, sublime Love! The sin of the loved one was\ndearer to him than all the virtues of which other women were capable,\nand whilst Mary Tudor would have given him a crown, he found it sweeter\nfar to accept ignominy for Ursula's sake.\n\nPerhaps something of all these thoughts which went on in his mind was\nreflected in his face, for Mary, who had been watching him keenly, said\nafter a while with a tone of bitter resentment--\n\n\"My lord, I know that your silence over this mysterious affair is\nmaintained out of a chivalrous desire to shield another .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. a woman.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Ah, consider. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"I have considered,\" replied Wessex firmly, \"and I entreat Your Majesty\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Nay! 'tis I who entreat,\" she interrupted him vehemently. \"Let us look\nfacts in the face, my lord. Think you we are all fools to believe in\nyour cock-and-bull story? A woman was seen that night flying from the\nPalace across the terrace .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. who was she? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. whence did she come?\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. None of the watch could see her face, and the louts were too\nstupid to run after her .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but there are those within this Court at\nthis moment who will swear that that woman was Ursula Glynde.\"\n\nStrangely enough this was the first time, since that fatal night, that\nthis name was actually spoken in Wessex' hearing: it seemed to sting him\nlike the cut of a lash across his face. For that one brief instant he\nlost his icy self-control, and Mary saw him wince.\n\n\"Ursula has been questioned,\" she continued, \"but she remains obdurately\nsilent. Believe me, my lord, you waste your chivalry in defence of a\nwanton.\"\n\nBut already Wessex had recovered himself.\n\n\"Your Majesty is mistaken,\" he rejoined calmly. \"I know naught of Lady\nUrsula Glynde, and I defend no one by confessing my crime.\"\n\n\"You'll not persist in that insensate confession.\"\n\n\"'Twill not be necessary, Your Majesty, my judges have it in full, writ\nby mine own hand.\"\n\n\"You'll recant it.\"\n\n\"Why should I? 'Twas done willingly, in full possession of my faculties,\nunder no compulsion.\"\n\n\"You'll recant it!\" she persisted obstinately.\n\n\"Why should I?\"\n\n\"Because I ask it of you,\" she said with great gentleness, \"because I\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nShe rose from her chair, and came closer to him. Then as he,\nrespectfully, would have risen too, she placed a detaining hand upon his\nshoulder.\n\n\"Listen, my lord,\" she said, \"for I've thought of it all. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. This is\nnot a moment when foolish prejudices and mock modesty should stand in\nthe way of so great an issue. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I would throw my soul, my future\nlife, my chances of paradise on that one stake--your innocence. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Nay, I pray you, do not waste these few valuable minutes in vain\nprotestations, which I'll not believe. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. There's not a sane man in\nthis country who thinks you guilty. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Yet on this confession your\njudges and peers will condemn you to death .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. must condemn you, so\nthat the law of England is satisfied--and you, my lord, will suffer\ndeath with a lie upon your lips.\"\n\n\"The truth,\" rejoined Wessex firmly; \"'twas I killed the Marquis de\nSuarez.\"\n\n\"A lie, my lord, a lie,\" protested Mary passionately; \"the first you've\never told, the last you'll be allowed to breathe. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. But let it pass.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I'll not torture your pride by forcing you to repeat that\nmonstrous tale again. Would I could wrench her secret from the cowardly\nlips of that hussy. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Oh! if I were a man .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. a king like my\nfather! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I'd have her broken on the wheel, tortured on the rack,\nwhipped, lacerated, burnt, but I'd have the truth from her!\"\n\nWessex took her hand in his. She was trembling from head to foot. The\ninward, real Mary Tudor had risen to the surface for this one brief\nmoment. All the cruelty in her, which in after life made this wretched\nwoman's name the byword of history, seemed just then to smother her very\nwomanhood, her every tender thought. At the touch of Wessex' hand she\npaused suddenly, shamed and in tears, that he should have seen her like\nthis.\n\n\"Before she came you said many sweet words to me,\" she murmured, as if\ntrying to find an excuse for her terrible outburst. \"Ah! I know .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I\nknow .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" she added, with a bitter tone of melancholy, \"you never\nloved me .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. how could you? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Men like you do not love an\nill-favoured creature like me, old, bad-tempered .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. with something of\nthe brute under the queenly robes. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. But .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you had affection for\nme once, my dear lord .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and an unimpassioned love can bring\nhappiness sometimes. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I would soon make you forget these last\nterrible days .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHer voice had sunk down very low, almost to a whisper now, the hand,\nwhich he still held in his own, trembled violently and became burning\nhot.\n\n\"And no one would dare to whisper ill of the King Consort of England.\"\n\nHe turned to her; she was standing beside him, her hand imprisoned in\nhis, her face bent so that he could not meet her eyes. But there was\nsuch an infinity of pathos in the attitude of this domineering, haughty\nwoman wilfully humbling her pride before her love, that with a tender\nfeeling of reverence he bent the knee before her and tenderly kissed her\nhand.\n\n\"Ah, my sweet Queen,\" he said with gentle sadness, \"I am and always will\nbe your most devoted subject--but do you not see how impossible it is\nthat I should accept this great honour, which you would deign to confer\nupon me?\"\n\n\"You refuse? Is it that you have not one spark of love for me?\"\n\n\"I have far too much veneration for my Queen to allow her to sully her\nfair name. If being avowedly guilty I were acquitted by Your Majesty's\ndesire, 'twould be said the Queen had saved her lover .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and then\nmarried a felon.\"\n\n\"I would stake mine honour, that no one shall dare .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Honour is already lost, my Queen, once it is at stake.\"\n\n\"But I will save you,\" cried Mary with ever-increasing vehemence, \"in\nspite of yourself, in spite of your confessions, in spite of all these\nlies and deceptions. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I'll save you in the very teeth of your\njudges and your peers, and proclaim to the whole world that I saved\nyou--guilty or not guilty, proud gentleman or felon--because my name is\nMary Tudor, and that there is no law in England outside my will.\"\n\nPride and passion almost beautified her. Her love for this man was the\none soft, tender trait in her strange and complex character, but\nTudor-like she _would_ have her way, she would rule his destiny, command\nhis fate, tear and destroy everything around her so long as her caprice\nheld sway. But he had suddenly risen to his feet, and stood confronting\nher now, tall and erect, with a pride as great, as obstinate as her own,\na haughty dignity which neither Queen nor destiny, neither sorrow,\ndisgrace or fear had the power to bend.\n\n\"Ere that dishonour fall upon us both, Your Majesty,\" he said firmly,\n\"the last Duke of Wessex will lie in a suicide's grave.\"\n\nHer eyes were fixed upon his, and he, carried away by the poignancy of\nthis supreme battle fought by his pride against her passion, allowed her\nto read his innermost thoughts. He had nothing to hide from her now, not\neven his love, miserable and desperate as it was: but he wanted her to\nknow that not even at this fateful moment, when he stood 'twixt a\nscaffold and a crown, did he waver in the firm resolve which had guided\nhim throughout his life.\n\nHe would _not_ become the tool and minion of a Tudor queen--loving\nenough now, but endowed with all the vices and all the arrogance of her\nrace; he would not barter his life in order to become the butt of\ncontending political factions, the toy of ambitious parties, flattered\nby some, hated by most, despised by all. A courtier, a lapdog, an\ninvertebrate creature without power or dignity.\n\nBah! the hangman's rope was less degrading!\n\nAnd Mary, as she read all this in the expressive eyes which met hers\nfully and unwaveringly, realized that her cause was lost. She had staked\neverything on this one final appeal, but she, a Tudor, had struck\nagainst an obstinacy greater than her own. She could not flatter, she\ncould not bribe, and he was--by the very hopelessness of his present\nposition--beyond the reach of threats or punishment.\n\nHe saw that her heart was admitting that she was vanquished. The\nhardness within him melted into pity.\n\n\"Believe me, my Queen,\" he said gently, \"the memory of your kind words\nwill accompany me to my life's end, it will cheer me to-morrow and\nsustain me to the last. And now for pity's sake,\" he added earnestly,\n\"may I entreat Your Majesty to order the guard .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and to let me go.\"\n\n\"That is not your last word, my lord,\" urged Mary with the insistence of\na desperate cause. \"Think. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"I have thought--much,\" he replied quietly. \"Life holds nothing very\ntempting at best, does it? The honour of the Queen of England and mine\nown self-esteem were too heavy a price to pay for so worthless a\ntrifle.\"\n\nMary would have spoken again, but just then there was a discreet knock\nat the door twice repeated. She had perforce to say--\n\n\"Enter!\" and the next moment a page-in-waiting stood bowing before her.\n\n\"What is it?\" she demanded.\n\n\"The Lord High Steward has arrived at the Palace, Your Majesty,\"\nannounced the page, \"and the Lieutenant of the Tower demands the\nprisoner.\"\n\n\"'Tis well! you may go.\"\n\n\"The Lieutenant of the Tower awaits Your Majesty's pleasure and His\nGrace of Wessex in the next room.\"\n\n\"'Tis well. The Lieutenant may wait.\"\n\nThe page bowed again and retired.\n\nThen only did Mary Tudor's self-control entirely desert her. Forgetting\nall her dignity and pride, her self-will and masterfulness, she clung to\nthe man she loved with passionate ardour, sobbing and entreating.\n\n\"No! no!--they shall not take you!--they dare not! Say but one word to\nme, my dear lord .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. what is it to you?--'twere all my life to me.\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. What should we care for the opinion of the world?--Am I not above\nit? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. so will you be when you are King of England. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nWessex had need of all his firmness, and of all his courage, to free\nhimself as gently as he could from her clinging arms. He waited until\nher half-hysterical paroxysm of grief had subsided, smoothing with\ntender hand her moist hair and burning forehead. She was a woman beside\nherself with grief, almost sublime in this hour of madness.\n\n\"I will not let you go!\" she repeated persistently.\n\nThrough the door there came the sound of a slight clash of arms. The\nLieutenant of the Tower and his guard were impatiently waiting for their\nprisoner. Wessex saw Mary's whole figure stiffen at this muffled sound.\nLike an enraged animal she turned towards the door. For one second he\nwondered what she would do, how much humiliation her uncontrolled\npassion would heap upon him, through some mad, impulsive action. He\njumped to his feet, and, regardless of all save the imminence of this\ncritical moment, he seized both her wrists in an iron grip, striving\nthrough the infliction of this physical pain to bring back her wandering\nsenses.\n\nShe looked him straight in the face with a tender and appealing gaze----\n\n\"Did you not know that I loved you even to humiliation?\" she said.\n\n\"May God and all His angels bless you for that love,\" he replied\nearnestly, \"but before Him and them I swear to you that if you do not\nallow the justice of your realm to have its will with me, I'll not\nsurvive your own disgrace and mine.\"\n\nShe closed her eyes, trying to shut out that picture of unbendable\ndetermination expressed in his whole attitude, and which she at last\nfelt that nothing would conquer. The rigidity of her figure relaxed,\nthe fury died out from her heart, she only felt inexpressibly sorrowful,\nhelpless and broken-hearted.\n\n\"God be with you, my dear lord,\" she whispered.\n\nHe kissed her hands: all the fever had gone out of them, they were icy\ncold: there was neither arrogance nor obstinacy in her face now, her\neyes were still closed, and one by one, heavy tears fell down her wan\ncheeks.\n\nThe pathos of her helplessness and of her crushed pride made a strong\nappeal to the sentiments of tender loyalty which he had always felt for\nher, who was his Queen and Liege Lady. He saw that she was determined\nnot to break down, that she was gathering all her courage for the\nsupreme farewell.\n\n\"I beseech Your Majesty to allow me to order the guard,\" he urged.\n\nShe tottered and would have fallen, had he not put out his arm to\nsupport her.\n\n\"Do not forget that you are a Tudor and a Queen, and remember,\" he added\nquaintly, as her head fell against his shoulder, \"remember .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I am\nonly a man!\"\n\nHe led her back to her seat, then he touched the handbell, and when the\npage appeared he said firmly--\n\n\"I am at the Lieutenant's service.\"\n\nHe knelt once more before the Queen and finally bade her farewell. She\ncould neither speak nor move, and scarcely had the strength to take a\nlast look at the loved one, as with a firm step he passed out of her\nsight.\n\nThere was a clash of steel against steel, a few words of command, the\nsound of retreating footsteps, then silence.\n\nQueen Mary Tudor was alone with her grief.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nA BARGAIN\n\n\nBut Mary would not have been the woman she was if she admitted a\nfailure, whilst there was still a chance of victory.\n\nThe first half-hour after Wessex' departure she gave way to weakness and\nto a flood of tears, she turned to her prie-Dieu and prayed fervently\nfor resignation to the heavenly will, for strength to bear her cross.\n\n\"Holy Mother of our crucified Lord, pray for me now and at the hour of\n_his_ death,\" was the burden of her passionate orisons.\n\n\"Take my life since _he_ must die,\" she added, striking her breast and\nfalling prostrate before the holy images.\n\nAnd then reaction set in. She felt more calm after her prayers, and\nbegan to think more clearly. The inevitableness of a catastrophe seemed\nto become less tangible, a persistent and hopeful \"if\" crept in amongst\nher desperate litanies. She dried her tears, rang for her waiting-woman,\nhad her face bathed with soothing, scented waters, her temples rubbed\nwith perfumed vinegar.\n\nAll the while now she repeated to herself--\n\n\"I _will_ save him .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I _will_ save him .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but how? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. how?\"\n\nShe had less than twenty-four hours in which to do it, and she had spent\nfourteen days previously in the same endeavour, without arriving at any\ndefinite plan, save the one which had so signally failed just now.\n\n\"If being found guilty I were acquitted at Your Majesty's desire,\n'twould be said the Queen had saved her lover--and then married a\nfelon!\" was his sole reply to her impassioned query whether he loved her\nand would be saved by her command.\n\nShe would have been content to lose her honour for his sake, he would\nnot even jeopardize his own self-esteem for hers. If he had one spark of\nlove for her he would have been content to challenge the opinion of the\nworld, whilst accepting his life at her hands, but he cared naught about\ndeath, and all the world for another woman who was false, a coward, a\nwanton, and who boldly allowed him to sacrifice his honour for her,\nwhilst she herself had none to lose.\n\n\"Then I will save him in spite of himself,\" repeated Mary for the\nhundredth time.\n\nSuddenly a thought struck her. She rang her hand-bell, and to the\nservitor who appeared at the door she commanded briefly--\n\n\"His Eminence the Cardinal de Moreno;--I desire his presence here at\nonce.\"\n\nThe servitor retired, and she waited in seeming calm, sitting at her\ndesk, her trembling hand alone betraying the excitement of her mind.\n\nFive minutes later, the Cardinal stood before her, placid, urbane,\npicturesque in his brilliant, flowing robes, with one white, richly\nbe-ringed hand raised in benediction, as he stood waiting for the Queen\nto speak.\n\n\"I pray Your Eminence to be seated,\" began Mary, speaking with feverish\nhaste. \"I have something of grave import to say to you, which brooks of\nno delay, else I had not interrupted you at your orisons.\"\n\n\"My time is ever at Your Majesty's service,\" replied the Cardinal\nhumbly. \"In what way may I have the honour to serve the Queen of England\nto-day?\"\n\nHe was looking keenly at her face: not a single sign of her intense\nmental agitation escaped his shrewd observation. A satisfied smile\nlurked round the corners of his thin lips, and a flash of triumph lit up\nthe depths of his piercing eyes.\n\nThat searching glance at Mary Tudor had told the envoy of the King of\nSpain that victory was at last within his grasp.\n\n\"My lord Cardinal,\" rejoined Mary firmly, \"you are aware of the fact\nthat His Grace of Wessex is on the eve of being tried by his peers, for\na heinous crime of which he is innocent.\"\n\n\"I am aware,\" replied the Cardinal gently, \"that His Grace stands\nself-convicted of the murder of my friend and colleague Don Miguel,\nMarquis de Suarez, a guest at Your Majesty's Court.\"\n\n\"Truce on this folly, my lord,\" retorted Mary impatiently, \"you know\njust as well as I do, that His Grace is incapable of any such act of\ncowardice, and that some mystery, which no one can fathom, lies at the\nbottom of this monstrous self-accusation.\"\n\n\"Whatever may be my own feelings in this matter, Your Majesty,\" said His\nEminence, still speaking very guardedly, \"I was forced to accomplish my\nduty, when I made and signed my deposition, which I fear me has gone far\ntowards confirming the guilt of His Grace.\"\n\n\"I have heard of your deposition, my lord. It rests on your finding His\nGrace's dagger. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Beside the body of the murdered man, and still stained with Don\nMiguel's blood.\"\n\n\"What of that? Some one else must have used the dagger.\"\n\n\"Possibly.\"\n\n\"You did not suggest this in your deposition.\"\n\n\"It was not asked of me by His Grace's judges.\"\n\n\"There is time to make a further statement.\"\n\n\"It could but be in consonance with what I have already said.\"\n\n\"And your servant?\"\n\n\"Pasquale?\"\n\n\"He lied when he averred that he heard angry words 'twixt His Grace and\nDon Miguel.\"\n\n\"He has sworn it upon oath. Pasquale is a good Catholic, and would not\ncommit the deadly sin of perjury.\"\n\n\"You are fencing with me, my lord,\" said Mary Tudor with sudden\nvehemence.\n\n\"I but await Your Majesty's command!\" rejoined His Eminence blandly.\n\n\"My command?\" she said firmly. \"This, my lord, that you save His Grace\nof Wessex from the consequences of this crime, in which he had no hand.\"\n\n\"To save His Grace of Wessex?\" he ejaculated with the greatest\nastonishment, \"I? and at this eleventh hour? Nay! meseems that were\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"Then Your Eminence can set your wits to attempt the impossible,\"\nrejoined Mary curtly.\n\n\"But why should Your Majesty suggest this strange task to me?\" he urged\nwith the same well-feigned surprise.\n\n\"Because Your Eminence hath more brains than most.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty is too gracious.\"\n\n\"And because you have the success of your own schemes more at heart than\nmost,\" added the Queen significantly.\n\n\"Then, if I do not succeed in effecting the impossible, Your Majesty, am\nI to be sent back to Spain ignominiously to-morrow?\" queried the\nCardinal with more than a soup\u00c3\u00a7on of sarcasm.\n\n\"No!\" rejoined Mary quietly, \"but if you succeed I will give you in\nreward anything which you may ask.\"\n\n\"Anything, my daughter? Even your hand in marriage to King Philip of\nSpain?\"\n\n\"If Your Eminence succeeds in effecting the impossible,\" replied Mary\nfirmly, \"I will marry King Philip of Spain.\"\n\nThere was silence for a moment or two. His Eminence was meditating. Not\nthat he had been taken unawares. For the past fortnight he had been\nexpecting some such interview as the Queen had now demanded at the\neleventh hour. He was far-seeing and shrewd enough to have anticipated\nthat, sooner or later, Mary Tudor would propose a bargain, whereby he\nwould be expected to pit his wits against Fate, and thereby earn the\nvictory which she knew he coveted. The task was a difficult one; not\nimpossible--for the Cardinal never admitted that anything was\nimpossible. But he was peculiarly placed, and he knew the value of royal\npromises and of royal compacts. This one he thought he could enforce,\nbut only if his methods were above suspicion. To have confessed the\nwhole dastardly intrigue of that eventful night would certainly have\nsaved the Duke from condemnation, but the tale itself would so disgust\nthese stiff-necked Britishers, that Mary would see herself easily\nreleased from her promise through unanimous public opinion.\n\nThat simple and sure method of obtaining the Duke's acquittal was\ntherefore barred to him, and he had perforce to reflect seriously, ere\nhe closed with the bargain which Mary Tudor held so temptingly before\nhim. His mind was clearer, less scrupulous than that of his colleagues,\nand he had most at stake now, for nothing but ultimate success could\njustify the heinousness of his methods. If his schemes failed, then\nthese methods became monstrous and criminal beyond hope of pardon.\n\nFor the moment the Cardinal had no remorse. The sacrifice of every piece\nin the great human game of chess was of no importance if the final\nmating of his enemies were gained. Don Miguel was dead, Lord Everingham\nfar away; the wench Mirrab, terrified at her own act probably, had\ndisappeared and no doubt would not be heard of again until His\nEminence's victory was assured. This he had hoped to attain with the\ndeath of the Duke of Wessex and Mary's consequent grief and feebleness\nof will, always supposing that Lord Everingham did not return in time to\nruin the whole scaffolding of his tortuous diplomacy.\n\nThat was the great danger and one which was ever present before the\nCardinal's mind: the return of Lord Everingham. Every day added to the\ndanger, and it was Wessex' own impatience to see the end of his own\nshattered existence, which had up to now saved His Eminence from\nexposure.\n\nThe Duke had urged that his trial should come on speedily. This was\nreadily granted, for he was the Duke of Wessex still. The trial itself\nwould not last more than the one day, seeing that the accused had made\nfull confession and only a few secondary depositions were to be read for\nform's sake. His Grace had refused counsel, there could be no argument.\nThe judges on the face of the circumstantial self-accusation were bound,\nin the name of justice, to convict and condemn, in spite of public\nopinion, in spite of the machinations of the Duke's friends, in spite\neven of the Queen's commands.\n\nOnce His Grace was out of the way, His Eminence had felt that he would\nbe able to breathe more freely, but until then he was living at the edge\nof a volcano, and often wondered how it had not broken out ere now.\n\nThe news of the crime and of Wessex' arrest had been sent to Scotland,\nhe knew that; but the way thither was long, the late October gales would\nmake the journey by sea difficult, whilst the overland roads, sodden\nwith the rain, were unusually bad; but in any event, Everingham was\nbound to arrive in England within the next ten days, for, of a surety,\nhe would travel with mad speed on hearing the terrible news.\n\nBut now Mary Tudor suddenly offered him a definite promise, a bargain\nwhich he could clinch before exposure had shamed him publicly. The task\nproposed was indeed difficult, but it was not impossible to such a\nfar-reaching mind as that of my lord Cardinal.\n\nA few moments' deep reflection, whilst the Queen watched him eagerly,\nand he had already formed a plan.\n\n\"Does Your Eminence accept the bargain?\" asked Mary impatiently at last,\nseeing that he seemed disinclined to break the silence.\n\n\"I accept it, Your Majesty,\" he replied quietly.\n\n\"You have my royal promise if you succeed.\"\n\n\"If His Grace to-morrow is acquitted by his judges, through my\nintervention,\" said His Eminence, \"I will claim Your Majesty's promise\nin the evening.\"\n\n\"Your Eminence can have a document ready and I will sign it.\"\n\n\"It shall be done as Your Majesty directs.\"\n\n\"Then I'll bid Your Eminence farewell, until to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I am ever at Your Majesty's service. But before retiring I would crave\none favour.\"\n\n\"I pray you speak.\"\n\n\"To speak to the Lady Ursula Glynde.\"\n\nA long bitter laugh of the keenest disappointment came from Mary Tudor's\noppressed heart.\n\n\"Nay!\" she said in a tone of deep discouragement, \"an you pin your faith\non that hussy, Your Eminence had best give up the attempt at once.\"\n\n\"Did I not say that I would attempt the impossible?\" said the Cardinal,\nunperturbed.\n\n\"The impossible indeed, an you wish to appeal to that wench,\" retorted\nMary drily.\n\n\"Have I Your Majesty's permission to speak to the lady?\" persisted the\nCardinal blandly.\n\nMary shrugged her shoulders impatiently. She was terribly disappointed.\nAll her hopes had been built on the clever machinations of this man, on\nsome tortuous means which his brain would surely evolve if she held out\na sufficiently tempting bait to him. She had half endowed him with\nsupernatural powers .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and now .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. an empty scheme to make an\nappeal to that heartless coward, who might save Wessex, yet refused to\ndo it!\n\nBut the Cardinal was smiling: he looked a rare picture of benevolence\nand dignity, with those white hands of his which seemed ever ready for a\ncaress. He looked triumphant too, his eyes were eagerly fixed upon her\nas if her consent to the useless interview was of great and supreme\nmoment. To her the appeal to Ursula did not even seem to be a last\nstraw, but something far more ephemeral, intangible, a breath from some\nmocking demon. Yet the Cardinal looked so satisfied. She shrugged her\nshoulders again, as if dismissing all hope, all responsibility, all\ninterest, but she said nevertheless--\n\n\"When does Your Eminence desire to see her?\"\n\n\"To-morrow in the Lord Chancellor's Court,\" he replied, \"half an hour\nbefore the arrival of the Lord High Steward. Can that be done?\"\n\n\"It shall be, since Your Eminence wishes it.\"\n\n\"And to-night I will announce the joyful news by special messenger to\nthe King of Spain,\" he added significantly.\n\n\"Is Your Eminence so sure of success then?\"\n\n\"As sure as I am of the fact that the Queen of England is the most\ngracious lady in Europe,\" he replied, with all the courtly grace which\nhe knew so well how to assume. \"I pray you then to trust in God,\" he\nconcluded earnestly, \"and in the devotion of Your Majesty's humble\nservant.\"\n\nHe took his leave ceremoniously, with pompous dignity, as was his wont.\nShe did not care to prolong the interview, and nodded listlessly when he\nprepared to go. She felt more than ever hopeless and angered with\nherself for having clinched a bargain with that man.\n\nBut His Eminence the Cardinal de Moreno left the presence of the Queen\nof England with a smile of satisfaction and a sigh of anticipated\ntriumph.\n\nIt was not an appeal which he meant to address to the Lady Ursula\nGlynde.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nIN THE LORD CHANCELLOR'S COURT\n\n\nThe great Hall at Westminster was already thronged with people at an\nearly hour of the morning, and the servants of the Knight Marshal and\nthe Lord Warden of the Fleet had much ado to keep the crowd back with\ntheir tipstaves.\n\nAll London was taking a holiday to-day: an enforced holiday as far as\nthe workers and merchants were concerned, for there surely would be no\nbusiness doing in the City when such great goings-on were occurring at\nWestminster.\n\nThe trial of His Grace the Duke of Wessex on a charge of murder! A trial\nwhich, seeing that the accused had confessed to the crime, could but end\nin a sentence of death.\n\nIt is not every day that it is given to humbler folk to see so proud a\ngentleman arraigned as any common vagabond might be, and to note how a\ngreat nobleman may look when threatened with the hangman's rope.\n\nIs there aught in the world half so cruel as a crowd?\n\nAnd His Grace had been very popular: always looked upon, even by the\nmeanest in the land, as the most perfect embodiment of English pride and\nEnglish grandeur, he had always had withal that certain graciousness of\nmanner which the populace will love, and which disarms envy.\n\nBut with the exception of his own friends, people of his own rank and\nstation, who knew him and his character intimately, the people at large\nnever for a moment questioned his guilt.\n\nHe had confessed! surely that was enough! The loutish brains of the\nlower proletariat did not care to go beyond that obvious self-evident\nfact. The meaner the nature of a man, the more ready is he to\nacknowledge evil, he seeks it out, recognizes it under every garb. Who,\namong the majority of people, cared to seek for sublime self-sacrifice\nin an ordinary confession of crime?\n\nThe wiseacres and learned men, the more wealthy burgesses, and people of\nmore consideration, were content with a few philosophical reflections\nanent the instability of human nature and the evil influences of Court\nlife and of great wealth.\n\nNo one cared about the man! it was the pageant they all liked. What\nthought had the mob of the agonizing rack to which a proud soul would\nnecessarily be subjected during the course of a wearisome and elaborate\ntrial? They only wanted to see a show, the robes of the judges, the\nassembly of peers, and that one central figure, the first gentleman in\nEngland, once almost a king--now a felon!\n\nA fine sight, my masters! His Grace of Wessex in a criminal dock!\n\nPlaces in the Hall were at a premium. The 'prentices were well to the\nfore as usual; like so many eel-like creatures, they had slipped into\nthe front rank as soon as the great doors had been opened. Some few\nwaifs and vagrants--acute and greedy of gain--were making good trade\nwith small wooden benches, which they sold at threepence the piece to\nthose who desired a better view.\n\nThe women were all wearing becoming gowns, sombre of hue as befitted the\noccasion. His Grace of Wessex was noted for his avowed admiration for\nthe beautiful sex. They had all brought large white kerchiefs, for they\nanticipated some exquisite emotions. His Grace was so handsome! there\nwas sure to be an occasion for tears.\n\nBut only as a pleasurable sentiment! Like one feels at the play, where\nthe actor expresses feelings, yet is himself cold and unimpassioned.\nWhat His Grace himself would feel was never considered. The crowd had\ncome to see, some had paid threepence for a clearer sight of the\naccused, and all meant to enjoy themselves this day.\n\nProud Wessex! thou hast sunk to this, a spectacle for a common holiday!\nThy face will be scanned lest one twitch escape! thy shoulders if they\nstoop, thy neck if it bend! A thousand eyes will be fixed upon thee in\ncuriosity, in derision--perchance in pity!\n\nYe gods, what a fall!\n\nThe Lord High Steward of England was expected to arrive at ten o'clock.\nIn the centre of the great court a large scaffold had been erected, not\nfar from the Lord Chancellor's Court. In the middle of this there was\nplaced a chair higher than the rest and covered with a cloth, which bore\nthe royal arms embroidered at the four corners.\n\nThis was for my Lord High Steward.\n\nEach side of him were the seats for the peers who were to be the triers.\nGreat names were whispered, as the servants of the Knight Marshal\narranged these in their respective places. There was the chair for the\nEarl of Kent, and my lord of Sussex, the Earl of Hertford, and Lord\nSaint John of Basing, and a score of others, for there were twenty-four\ntriers in all.\n\nOn a lower form were the seats for the judges, and in a hollow place cut\nin the scaffold itself, and immediately at the feet of my Lord High\nSteward, the Clerk of the Crown would sit with his secondary.\n\nAnd facing the judges and the peers was the bar, where presently the\nexalted prisoner would stand.\n\nNo one was here yet of the greater personages, the servants were still\nbusy putting everything to right, but some gentlemen of the Queen's\nhousehold had already arrived, and several noble lords who would be mere\nspectators. His Grace's friends could easily be distinguished by the\nsombreness of their garb and the air of grief upon their faces. Mr.\nThomas Norton, the Queen's printer, was sorting his papers and cutting\nhis pens, and two gentlemen ushers were receiving final instructions\nfrom Garter King-at-Arms.\n\nThere was indeed plenty for the idlers to see. Great ropes had been\ndrawn across the further portions of the Hall, leaving a wide passage\nfrom the main entrance right down the centre and up to the Lord High\nSteward's seat. Behind these ropes the crowd was forcibly kept back. And\nthe gossip and the noise went on apace. Laughter too and merry jests,\nfor this was a holiday, my masters, presently to be brought to a\nclose--after the death sentence had been passed and every one\ndispersed--with lively jousts and copious sacks of ale.\n\nBut of all this excitement and bustle not a sound penetrated within the\nprecincts of the Lord Chancellor's Court, where His Eminence the\nCardinal de Moreno sat patiently waiting.\n\nDesirous above all things of escaping observation, he had driven over\nfrom Hampton Court in the early dawn, and wrapped in a flowing black\ncloak, which effectually hid his purple robes, he had slipped into the\nHall and thence into the Inner Court, even before the crowd had begun to\ncollect. Since then he had sat here quietly buried in thoughts, calmly\nlooking forward to the interview, which was destined finally to unravel\nthe tangled skein of his own diplomacy. Once more the destinies of\nEurope were hanging on a thread: a girl's love for a man.\n\nWell! so be it! His Eminence loved these palpitating situations, these\nhairbreadth escapes from perilous positions which were the wine and salt\nof his existence. He was ready to stake his whole future career upon a\nwoman's love! He, who had scoffed all his life at sentimental passions,\nwho had used every emotion of the human heart, aye! and its every\nsuffering, merely as so many assets in the account of his far-reaching\npolicy, he now saw his whole future depending on the strength of a\ngirl's feelings.\n\nThat she would certainly come, he never for a moment held in doubt. In\nthese days the commands of a sovereign were akin to the dictates of God;\nto disobey was a matter of treason. Aye! she would come, sure enough!\nnot only because of her allegiance to the Queen, but because of her\nintense, vital interest in the great trial of the day.\n\nSo His Eminence waited patiently in the Lord Chancellor's Court, which\ngave straight into the great Hall itself, until the appointed time.\n\nExactly at half-past nine the door of the room was opened, and Ursula\nGlynde walked in. The Cardinal rose from his seat and would have\napproached her, but she retreated a step or two as he came near and said\ncoldly--\n\n\"'Tis Your Eminence who desired my presence?\"\n\n\"And 'tis well that you came, my daughter,\" he replied kindly.\n\n\"I was commanded by Her Majesty to attend; I had not come of my own free\nwill.\"\n\nShe spoke quietly but very stiffly, as one who is merely performing a\nsocial duty, without either pleasure or dislike. The Cardinal studied\nher face keenly, but obviously she had been told nothing by the Queen as\nto the precise object of this interview.\n\nShe looked pale and wan: there was a look of acute suffering round the\nchildlike mouth, which would have seemed pathetic to any one save to\nthis callous dissector of human hearts. Her eyes appeared unnaturally\nlarge, with great dilated pupils and dry eyelids. She was dressed in\ndeep black, with a thick veil over her golden hair, which gave her a\nnunlike appearance, and altogether made her look older, and strangely\ndifferent from the gay and girlish figure so full of life and animation\nwhich had been one of the brightest ornaments of old Hampton Court\nPalace. The Cardinal motioned her to a seat, which she took, then she\nwaited with perfect composure until His Eminence chose to speak.\n\n\"My child,\" he said at last, bringing his voice down to tones of the\ngreatest gentleness, \"I would wish you to remember that it is an old man\nwho speaks to you: one who has seen much of the world, learnt much,\nunderstood much. Will you try and trust him?\"\n\n\"What does Your Eminence desire of me?\" she rejoined coldly.\n\n\"Nay! 'tis not a question of desire, my daughter, I would merely wish to\ngive you some advice.\"\n\n\"I am listening to Your Eminence.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"I am listening to Your Eminence.\"]\n\nThe Cardinal had taken the precaution of placing himself with his back\nto the light which entered, grey and mournful, through the tall leaded\nwindow above. He was sitting near a table covered with writing\nmaterials, and in a large high-backed tapestried chair, which further\nenhanced the ponderous dignity of his appearance, whilst helping to\nenvelop his face in complete shadow. Ursula sat opposite to him on a low\nstool, that same grey light falling full upon her pale face, which was\nturned serenely, quite impassively upon her interlocutor.\n\nHis Eminence rested his elbow on the arm of his chair and his head in\nhis delicate white hands. The purple robes fell round him in majestic\nfolds, the gold crucifix at his breast sparkled with jewels: he was a\npast master in the art of _mise-en-sc\u00c3\u00a8ne_, and knew the full value of\nimpressive pauses and of effective attitudes during a momentous\nconversation, more especially when he had to deal with a woman. His\npresent silence helped to set the young girl's aching nerves on edge,\nand he noticed with a sense of inward satisfaction that her composure\nwas not as profound as she would have him think: there was a distinct\ntremor in the delicate nostrils, a jerkiness in the movements of her\nhand, as she smoothed out the folds of her sombre gown.\n\n\"My dear child,\" he began once more, and this time in tones of more\npronounced severity, \"a brave man, a good and chivalrous gentleman, is\nabout to suffer not only death, but horrible disgrace. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. On the\nother side of these thin walls the preparations are ready for his trial\nby a group of men, whose duty it will be anon to allow the justice of\nthis realm to take its relentless course. The accused will stand\nself-convicted, yet innocent, before them.\"\n\nOnce more the Cardinal paused: only for a second this time. He noticed\nthat the young girl had visibly shuddered, but she made no attempt to\nspeak.\n\n\"Innocent, I repeat it,\" he resumed after a while. \"His Grace has many\nfriends; not one of them will believe that he could be capable of so\nfoul a crime. But he has confessed to it. He will be condemned, and\nhe--the proudest man in England--will die a felon's death. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"I knew all that, Your Eminence,\" she said quietly. \"Why should you\nrepeat it now?\"\n\n\"Only because .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" said the Cardinal with seeming hesitation, \"you\nmust forgive an old man, my child .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. methought you loved His Grace of\nWessex and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Why does Your Eminence pause?\" she rejoined. \"You thought that I loved\nHis Grace of Wessex .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0?\"\n\n\"And yet, my child, through a strange, nay, a culpable obstinacy, you,\nwho could save him not only from death, but also from dishonour, you\nremain silent!\"\n\n\"Your Eminence errs, as every one else has erred,\" she replied with the\nsame cold placidity; \"I am silent because I have naught to say.\"\n\nThe Cardinal smiled with kind indulgence, like a father who understands\nand forgives the sins of his child.\n\n\"Let us explain, my daughter,\" he said. \"That fatal night, when the\nMarquis de Suarez was killed, a woman was seen to fly from that part of\nthe Palace where the tragedy had just taken place. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Do you not see that if that woman came forward fearlessly and owned the\ntruth, that it was from jealousy or even to defend her honour that His\nGrace killed Don Miguel, do you not see that no judge then will find him\nguilty of a wilful and premeditated crime?\"\n\n\"Then why does not that woman come forward?\" she retorted with the first\nsign of vehemence, noticeable in the quiver of her voice and the sudden\nflash in her pale cheeks, \"why does she not speak? she for whose sake\nHis Grace of Wessex not only took a man's life but is willing to\nsacrifice his honour?\"\n\n\"She seems to have disappeared,\" said His Eminence softly, \"perhaps she\nis dead. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Some say it was you,\" he added, leaning slightly forward\nand dropping his voice to a whisper.\n\n\"They lie,\" she replied. \"I was not there. 'Tis not for me His Grace of\nWessex will suffer both death and disgrace in silence.\"\n\nThis time His Eminence did not smile. There had been a sudden flash in\nhis eyes at this quick, sharp retort--a sudden flash as suddenly veiled\nagain. Then his heavy lids drooped; once more he looked paternal,\nbenevolent, only just with a soup\u00c3\u00a7on of sternness in his impassive face,\nthe aloofness of an austere man towards the weaknesses of more mundane\ncreatures.\n\nNever for a moment did he reveal to the unwary young girl all that he\nhad guessed through her last unguarded speech.\n\nHer love for Wessex! that he knew already! Its depth alone was a\nrevelation to him. But her jealousy! How her lips had trembled and her\nhand twitched when speaking of another, an unknown woman who had called\nforth in Wessex that spirit of noble self-sacrifice, that immolation of\nhis own honour and dignity, which had finally landed him in a criminal\ndock.\n\nA woman's passion and a woman's jealousy! Two precious assets in His\nEminence's present balance. He pondered over what he had learned, and\nvictory loomed more certain than before. He loved this present\nsituation, the acute tension of this palpitating moment, when he seemed\nto hold this beautiful woman's soul, bare and fettered, writhing with\nagony and self-torture.\n\nTo dissect a human heart! to watch its every quiver, to note the effect\nof every searing iron applied with a skilful hand! then to achieve\nsuccess in the end through subtle arts and devices seemingly so full of\nbenevolence, yet instinct with the most refined, most far-reaching\ncruelty! This was the form of enjoyment which more than any other\nappealed to the jaded mind of this blas\u00c3\u00a9 diplomatist. The feline nature\nwithin him loved this game with the trembling mouse.\n\nBut outwardly he sighed, a deep sigh of disappointment.\n\n\"Ah! if they lie!\" he said, a gentle tone of melancholy pervading his\nentire attitude, \"if indeed it was not you, my daughter, who were with\nDon Miguel that night .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. then naught can save His Grace. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. He has\nsuffered in silence. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. He will die to-morrow in silence .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and\ninnocent.\"\n\nHe had risen from his chair, and began wandering about the narrow\nroom--aimlessly--as if lost in thought. Ursula was staring straight\nbefore her. The first revelation of her present danger had suddenly\ncome to her. As in a flash she had suddenly realized that this man had\nsent for her in order to use her for his own ends. She felt that she was\nliterally in the position of the mouse about to be sacrificed to the\ngreedy ambition of this feline creature, who had neither rectitude nor\ncompunction where his ambition was at stake.\n\nYet after that one betrayal of her emotions she had made a vigorous\neffort to regain her self-control. Every instinct of self-preservation\nwas on the alert now, and yet she knew already that she was bound to\nsuccumb. To what she could not guess, but she felt herself the weaker\nvessel of the two. He was calm and cruel, passionless and tortuous,\nwhilst she _felt_ with all her heart and soul and with all her senses.\n\nAnd though he could not now see her face the Cardinal studied her every\nmovement. He could see her figure stiffen with the iron determination to\nretain her self-possession, and inwardly he smiled, for he knew that the\nnext moment all that rigidity would vanish, the marble statue would\nbecome living clay, the palsied nerves would quiver with horror, and she\nherself would fall, a weeping, wailing creature, supplicating at his\nfeet.\n\nAnd this by such a simple method!\n\nJust the opening of a door! gently, noiselessly, until the sound from\nthe Great Hall entered into this inner room, and voices clearly detached\nthemselves from the confusing hubbub.\n\nThen His Eminence whispered, \"Hush, my daughter! listen! my Lord High\nSteward is speaking.\"\n\nAt first perhaps she did not hear, certainly she did not understand, for\nher attitude did not relax its uncompromising stiffness.\n\nLord Chandois was delivering his first speech.\n\n\"My lords and gentlemen,\" he said, \"ye are here assembled this day that\nye may try Robert d'Esclade, Duke of Wessex, for a grievous and heinous\ncrime, which he hath wilfully committed.\"\n\nIt was just the opening and shutting of a door--the claw of the cat upon\nthe neck of the mouse. At first sound of Wessex' name Ursula had risen\nto her feet, straight and rigid like a machine. She did not look towards\nthe door, but fixed her eyes on him--her tormentor--fascinated as a\nbird, to whom a snake has beckoned and bade it to come nigh.\n\nThe colour rose to her cheeks, the reality was gradually dawning upon\nher. That man who spoke in the Great Hall beyond was a judge--there were\nother judges there too. When she arrived at Westminster she had seen a\ngreat concourse of people, heard the names of great legal dignitaries\nwhispered round her, and of peers who had been summoned for a great\noccasion.\n\nThat occasion was the trial of the Duke of Wessex on a charge of murder.\n\n\"No, no, no,\" she whispered hoarsely, somewhat wildly, as she took a\nstep forward; \"no, no, no .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. not yet .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. it is not true .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. not\nyet----\"\n\nThe thin crust of ice which had enveloped her heart was melting in the\nbroad garish light of the actual, awful fact--the commencement of\nWessex' trial.\n\nShe tottered and might have fallen but for the table close beside her,\nagainst which she leant.\n\nHer calm and composure were flying from her bit by bit. She had at last\nbegun to understand--to realize. Up to now it had all been so shadowy,\nso remote, almost like a dream. She had not seen Wessex since that last\nhappy moment when he had pressed her against his heart .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. since then\nshe had only heard rumours .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. wild statements .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. she knew of his\nself-accusation--the terrible crime which had been committed--but her\nheart had been numbed through the very appalling nature of the\ncatastrophe following so closely upon her budding happiness .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. it had\nall been intangible all this while .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. whilst now .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\n\n\"The Duke hath made confession,\" said the Cardinal, and his voice seemed\nto come as if in direct answer to her thoughts. \"In an hour at most\njudgment will be pronounced against him, and then sentence of death.\"\n\nShe passed her hand across her moist forehead, trying to collect her\nscattered senses. She looked once or twice at him in helpless, appealing\nmisery, but his face now was stern and implacable, he seemed to her to\nbe the presentment of a relentless justice about to fall on an innocent\nman. Her throat felt parched, her lips were dry, yet she tried to speak.\n\n\"It cannot be .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" she repeated mechanically, \"it cannot be .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. no,\nno, my lord, you are powerful .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you are great and clever .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you\nwill find a means to save him .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you will .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you will .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you\nsent for me. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Oh! was it in order to torture me like this that you\nsent for me?\"\n\n\"My child. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"That woman?\" she continued wildly, not heeding him, \"that woman .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nwhere is she? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. find her, my lord .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. find her, and let me speak\nto her. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Oh! I'll find the right words to melt her heart .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. she\nmust speak .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. she must tell the truth .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. she cannot let him die\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. no, no .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. not like that. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nGone was all her pride, all her icy reserve, even jealousy had vanished\nbefore the awful inevitableness of his dishonour and his death. She\nwould have dragged herself at the feet of those judges who were about to\ncondemn him, of this man who was taking a cruel delight in torturing\nher; nay! she would have knelt and kissed the hands of that unknown\nrival, for whose sake she had endured the terrible mental tortures of\nthe past few days, if only she could wrench from her the truth which\nwould set _him_ free from all this disgrace.\n\n\"That woman!\" she repeated with agonizing passion, \"that woman .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nwhere is she? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"She stands now before me,\" said the Cardinal sternly, \"repentant, I\nhope, ready to speak the truth.\"\n\n\"No! no! it is false!\" she protested vehemently, \"false I tell you! It\nwas not I .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHer voice broke in a pitiable, wistful sob, which would have melted a\nheart less stony than that which beat in the Cardinal's ambitious\nbreast.\n\n\"Oh! have I not endured enough?\" she murmured half to herself, half in\nappealing misery to him. \"Jealousy--hate for that woman whom he loves as\nhe never hath loved me .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. whom he loves better than his honour .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nfor whose sake he will stand there anon, branded with infamy. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHer knees gave way under her, she fell half prostrate on the floor at\nthe very feet of her tormentor.\n\n\"Find her, my lord,\" she sobbed passionately, \"find her .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you can\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you can. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nBut for sole answer he once more pushed the door ajar.\n\nAnother voice came from the body of the hall now, that of Mr. Barham,\nthe Queen's Serjeant--\n\n\"And having proved Robert d'Esclade, Duke of Wessex, guilty of this most\nheinous murder, I, on behalf of the Crown, will presently ask you, my\nlord, to pass sentence of death upon him.\"\n\n\"No, no, no--not death!\" she moaned, \"not death. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. They are mad, my\nlord--are they not mad? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. He guilty of murder! Oh! will no one come\nforward to prove him innocent?\"\n\n\"No one can do that but you, my daughter,\" replied His Eminence sternly,\nas he once more closed the door.\n\n\"But you do not understand. In God's name, what would you have me do? I\nloved him, it is true, but .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. it was another woman .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. not I!\nanother woman, whose honour is dearer to him than his own .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. for\nwhose sake he killed .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. for whose sake he is silent .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. for whose\nsake he will die .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but that woman was not I .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. not I!\"\n\n\"Alas!\" he replied placidly, \"then indeed nothing can save His Grace\nfrom the block. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nHe sighed and returned to his former place beside the table, like a man\nwho has done all that duty demanded of him, and now is weary and ready\nto let destiny take its course.\n\nUrsula watched him dully, stupidly; she could not read just then what\nwent on behind that mask of suave benevolence. Could she have read the\nCardinal's innermost thoughts she would have seen that complete\nsatisfaction filled his ambitious heart. He knew that he had succeeded,\nit was but a question of time .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. a few minutes, perhaps; but he had a\ngood quarter of an hour to spare, in which the tortured soul before him\nwould fight its last fight with despair. There was the long arraignment\nto be read out by the Clerk of the Crown, then the names of the triers\nto be called out in their order--all that, before the prisoner was\nactually called to the bar. Oh yes! he had plenty of time, now that he\nwas sure of victory.\n\nThe girl wandered mechanically towards the door, her trembling hand\nsought the latch, but was too weak to turn it. She glued her ear to the\nlock and perchance heard a word or two, for even the Cardinal caught the\nsound of a loud voice reading the deadly indictment.\n\n\"The prisoner hath confessed .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\n\n\"This most heinous crime .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\n\n\"For which sentence of death .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\n\n\"Return his precept and bring forth the prisoner.\"\n\nUrsula straightened out her girlish figure; with a firm hand now she\nsmoothed her veil over her hair, and rearranged the disordered folds of\nher kerchief. She crossed the room with an unfaltering step, and once\nmore took a seat on the low stool opposite to His Eminence the Cardinal.\n\nShe seemed to have reassumed the same icy calm which she had worn\nearlier in the interview; she was quite pale again, and all traces of\ntears had disappeared from her eyes.\n\nQuite instinctively, certainly against his will, the Cardinal failed to\nreturn the steady gaze which she now fixed upon him. As she sat there\nclose to him, her great lustrous eyes trying to search his very soul, he\nknew that at last she had guessed.\n\nShe _knew_ that he was fully aware of the fact that she was not the\nwoman for whose sake the Duke of Wessex was suffering condemnation at\nthis very moment. All the meshes of the base intrigue which had landed\nthe man she loved in a felon's dock escaped her utterly, but this much\nshe realized, that the Cardinal had worked for the Duke's undoing, that\nhe knew who her rival was, that he was wilfully shielding that woman,\nwhilst callously sacrificing her--Ursula Glynde--to the success of some\nfurther scheme.\n\nShe knew all that, yet she did not hesitate. Her love for Wessex had\nfilled all her life--first as a child, then as an ignorant girl\nworshipping an ideal. When she saw him, and in him saw the embodiment of\nall her most romantic beliefs, she loved him with all the passionate\nardour of her newly awakened woman's heart. From the moment that his\ntouch had thrilled her, that his voice had set her temples throbbing,\nthat her pure lips had met his own, she had given him her whole love,\ngiven herself to him body and soul for his happiness and her own.\n\nSo great was her love that jealousy had not killed it; it had changed\nher joy into sorrow, her happiness into bitterness, but the heart which\nshe gave to him she was powerless to take away. He had fooled her, led\nher to believe in his love for her, but his life was as precious to her\nnow as it had been that afternoon--which seemed so long ago--when she\nfirst raised her eyes to his and met his ardent gaze.\n\nShe was face to face with the most cruel problem ever set before a human\nheart, for she firmly believed that if through her self-sacrifice she\nsaved him from death and dishonour, he would nevertheless inevitably\nturn to the other woman, for whose sake he was suffering now; yet she\nwas ready with the sacrifice, because of the selflessness of her love.\n\nHow well the Cardinal had managed the tragedy which had parted two noble\nhearts! Each believed the other treacherous and guilty, yet each was\nprepared to lay down life, honour, happiness for the sake of the loved\none.\n\n\"Your Eminence,\" said Ursula very quietly after a little while, \"you\nsaid just now that I could save His Grace of Wessex from unmerited\ndisgrace and death. Tell me now, what must I do?\"\n\n\"It is simple enough, my daughter,\" he replied, still avoiding her\nclear, steadfast gaze; \"you have but to speak the truth.\"\n\n\"The truth, they say, oft lies hidden in a well, my lord,\" she rejoined.\n\"I pray Your Eminence to guide me to its depths.\"\n\n\"I can but guide your memory, my daughter, to the events of the fateful\nnight when Don Miguel was murdered.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"You were there, in the Audience Chamber, were you not?\"\n\n\"I was there,\" she repeated mechanically.\n\n\"With Don Miguel de Suarez, who, taking advantage of the late hour and\nthe loneliness of this part of the Palace .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. insulted you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. or\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Let us say that he insulted me. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"His Grace then came upon the scene?\"\n\n\"Just as Your Eminence describes it.\"\n\n\"And 'twas to defend your honour that the Duke of Wessex killed Don\nMiguel.\"\n\n\"To defend mine honour the Duke of Wessex killed Don Miguel.\"\n\n\"This you will swear to be true?\"\n\n\"Without hope of absolution.\"\n\n\"And you will make this tardy confession, my daughter, to His Grace's\njudges freely?\"\n\n\"Whenever it is deemed necessary I will make the confession to His\nGrace's judges freely.\"\n\nShe swayed as if her senses were leaving her. Instinctively the Cardinal\nput out his arm to support her, but with a mighty effort she drew\nherself together, and looked down upon him with all the regal majesty of\nher own sublime self-sacrifice.\n\nBut, flushed with victory, His Eminence cared nothing for the contempt\nof the vanquished. It had been a hard-fought battle. His Grace was saved\nfrom death and Queen Mary Tudor could not help but keep her word. It was\na triumph indeed!\n\nHe touched a hand-bell, a servant appeared. A few whispered instructions\nand the end was accomplished at last.\n\nBut, God in Heaven, at what terrible cost!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nWESTMINSTER HALL\n\n\nA surging, seething crowd! heads upon heads in a dense, compact mass--a\ndouble row of men, women, boys, and girls, held back with difficulty by\nthe Serjeant-at-Arms and his men, armed with halberds and tipstaves!\n\nA crowd come to gape and grin, some to sympathize--but only a very few\nof these. All come to see how the proudest gentleman in England would\nbear himself in a felon's dock.\n\nThe dull grey light of an early November day came in ghostly streaks\nthrough the huge window of the Hall, throwing into bold relief the\nscarlet-clad figures of the twenty-four noble lords who were to be the\nDuke's triers, the gorgeous robes of the judges, and the dull black\ngowns of the attorneys and the minor dignitaries.\n\nQuick, excited whispers passed from mouth to mouth as now and then a\nfamiliar face detached itself from the crowd of all these awesome\npersonages and was recognized by the people.\n\n\"That's my lord Huntingdon,\" said an elderly merchant, pointing to a\ngrey-bearded lord who had just taken his seat. \"I mind him well when\nfirst he bought a pair of spurs in my father's shop.\"\n\n\"Aye! and there's Lord Northampton,\" commented another, \"and mightily\nthankful he should be not to be standing at the bar himself for high\ntreason.\"\n\n\"That's Mr. Gilbert Gerard, the Attorney-General,\" quoth one who knew.\n\n\"Sh! sh! sh!\" came in excited whispers all around, \"here comes the Lord\nHigh Steward himself and all the judges.\"\n\nThe procession awed the populace, for every new-comer--gorgeously\napparelled though he was--wore a grave face and a saddened mien. The\ncrowd, who had come for a day's pageant, a frolic not unlike the happy\ndoings at East Molesey Fair, felt suddenly silenced and oppressed. Some\nof the women shivered beneath their thin kerchiefs; the devout ones made\na quick sign of the cross, as if prayers were about to begin.\n\nIt was all so solemn and so grand, in this dim winter's light, wherein\nshadows seemed to hover all around, hiding the remote corners of the\nHall and dwelling mysteriously on that tall scaffold, whereon one by one\nthese reverend personages took their allotted seats.\n\nThe Queen's Serjeant carried the white rod, and escorted my Lord High\nSteward to the great chair, covered with a gorgeous cloth, which\ndominated the entire hall. To the right and left of him sat the\ntwenty-four peers with their ermine-decked cloaks over their shoulders.\n\nBelow them sat the Lord Chief Justice of England, the Lord Chief Justice\nof Common Pleas, and the Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, and also the\nrest of the minor judges. The Clerk of the Crown, in black gown and\nyellow hose, had been busy some time conversing with his secondary. Next\nto the judges sat several gentlemen of the Queen's household, their\nsilken doublets of rich though sombre hues adding a crisp note of\ncontrasting colour to the harmonies in scarlet and dull oak, which\nfilled in the background of the picture.\n\nSir Walter Mildmay, Chancellor of the Exchequer, sat close by with six\nof the Queen's Privy Councillors, also on their left the Master of\nRequests and other persons of note. Immediately facing the bar was the\nQueen's Serjeant, the Attorney-General, the Solicitor-General, and the\nAttorney-General of the Court of Wards. The Recorder of London had been\ngiven a special seat, also Mr. Thomas Norton, the Queen's printer, who\nwrote out the historical account of the trial, which has been preserved\namongst the State papers.\n\nThen my Lord High Steward stood up bareheaded, holding the white rod in\nhis hand, and the Serjeant-at-Arms stepped forward into the immediate\ncentre of the Hall facing the crowd, and read out the proclamation as\nfollows:--\n\n\"My Lord's Grace, the Queen's Majesty's Commissioner, High Steward of\nEngland, commandeth every man to keep silence on pain of imprisonment\nand to hear the Queen's Commission read.\"\n\nThis was followed by the reading of the Queen's Commission by the Clerk\nof the Crown, after which--still standing--he read the indictment in a\nloud voice, so that all might hear.\n\n\"Whereas Robert d'Esclade, fifth Duke of Wessex, did on the night of the\nfourteenth of October of this year of our Lord one thousand five hundred\nand fifty-three, unlawfully kill Don Miguel, Marquis de Suarez, grandee\nof Spain .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nThe voice of the Clerk went droning on, the people amazed, horrified,\ntried not to lose one single word of this strange document which so\nloudly proclaimed the fact that a dastardly crime, unparalleled in its\ncowardice and ferocity, had been committed by one who until now had\nstood above all Englishmen as a model of honour, loyalty, and truth.\n\nWith every fresh charge, skilfully woven together and intertwined with\nsundry depositions obtained from my lord Cardinal and his retinue, the\ncrowd of spectators realized more and more that they were face to face\nwith a weird and mysterious tragedy, not a pageant, but an appalling\ndrama, the prologue of which was being enacted before them now.\n\nIt seemed, as the Clerk pursued his reading, that he was slowly\nunfolding mesh by mesh a hideous web, in the midst of which the presence\nof a death-dealing and loathsome spider could as yet only be dimly\nguessed.\n\nA close, clinging web from which no man, be he the premier peer of\nEngland or the humblest commoner, could ever hope to escape.\n\nThe web of a rough and misguided justice, of a law of the talion,\nretributive and blind, distributing with an impartial hand condemnations\nand punishments to guilty and innocent alike, to the martyr and to the\nfelon, to the coward and the deceived.\n\nThis was not a decadent, puny century, peopled with neurotics and\nfeeble-minded weaklings, it was a century of men!--men who were giants\nalike in their virtues and their passions, their vices and their\natrocities, narrow in their views, but staunch in their beliefs, savage\nin their creeds and prejudices--but MEN for all that.\n\n\"The more heinous the offence the less chance shall the prisoner have of\njustifying his conduct.\" That was the dictate of the law.\n\n\"For truly,\" said Sir Robert Catline, Lord Chief Justice of England, in\nthe course of the trial of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton for high treason,\n\"justice must not be confused by sundry arguments in the prisoner's\ncause, which might lead to his acquittal and the non-punishment of so\ngrave a fault.\"\n\nWitnesses were seldom, if ever, examined in the presence of the accused.\nDepositions were extorted--often by torture, always by threats--from\npersons who happened to be friends or associates of the prisoner.\n\nAn acquittal?--perish the thought! Let the citizen look to himself ere\nhe fell in the clutches of his country's justice; once there he had\nlittle or no chance of proving his innocence.\n\nLest the guilty escape!\n\nAlways that awful possibility! Rough justice demanded punishment--always\npunishment--lest the guilty escape!\n\nAnd the people as they listened knew that they had come to see a man's\nlast day upon earth.\n\nProud, rich, fastidious Wessex! this is the end of all things! Pomp and\nceremony, gorgeous robes and costly apparels! these to speed thee on thy\nway; but as inevitably as the dull winter's night must follow this grey\nNovember morning, so will pomp and circumstance fade away into the past\nand leave thee with but one red-clad figure by thy side--that of the\nheadsman with the axe.\n\nJustice to-day could make short work of her duties.\n\nRobert d'Esclade, fifth Duke of Wessex, had confessed to his crime, why\nshould Justice trouble herself to prove that which was already admitted?\nShe had merely to think out the form and severity of the punishment for\nthis man of high degree, who had sunk and stooped so low.\n\nFor form's sake a few depositions had been taken, for this was an\nunusual event--a specially atrocious crime! the murder of a foreign\nenvoy at the Court of the Queen of England, and at the hand of the\npremier peer of the realm!\n\nThe Cardinal de Moreno, envoy in chief of His Majesty the King of Spain,\nhad given the matter a political significance. In the name of his royal\nmaster he had demanded judgment on that most monstrous felony, and the\nexercise of the full rigour of the law. The Duke of Wessex had been a\nrival suitor for the hand of the Queen of England, and he\nhad--presumably--wilfully removed a successful diplomatist who\nthreatened to thwart his projects.\n\nAnd thus Wessex was arraigned for treason as well as for murder, and the\nindictment set forth the depositions of my lord Cardinal and those of\nhis servant Pasquale, all of which His Grace had declined to peruse. He\nknew that these statements were lies, guessed well enough how his\nenemies would heap proof upon proof to bolster up his own brief\nconfession.\n\nHis Eminence had made a sworn statement that he heard angry voices\n'twixt Don Miguel and His Grace some little time before the Marquis was\nfound dead. Well, that was true enough! There _had_ been a deadly\nquarrel, and though this did not aggravate the case, it helped to\nestablish the facts, if public opinion was like to sway the judges or if\ndisbelief in Wessex' guilt was too firmly rooted in the minds of his\npeers.\n\nThe indictment was a masterpiece, well could the Solicitor-General pride\nhimself on the perfection of the document.\n\nA dull, oppressive silence had fallen upon this vast concourse of\npeople. Interest, which was at fever-pitch, had forcibly to be kept in\ncheck, but now, as the Clerk's final words echoed feebly through the\nvast hall, a great sigh of eager excitement rose from the entire\nmultitude.\n\nEverything so far had been but preliminary, the somewhat dull, lengthy\nprologue of the coming palpitating drama. But at last the curtain was\nabout to rise on the first act, and the chief actor was ready to step\nupon the stage.\n\nAlready from afar loud murmurs and excited cries proclaimed the approach\nof the prisoner.\n\n\"He hath arrived from the Tower,\" whispered the 'prentices to one\nanother.\n\nThe distant murmurs grew in volume, then came nearer and nearer. All\nnecks were craned to see the Duke arrive, and even the repeated calls of\nthe Serjeant-at-Arms demanding silence were now left unheeded.\n\nWhispers passed from lip to ear. Comments and conjectures flew through\nthe crowd. Was not this the most interesting moment of this interesting\nday?\n\n\"How would he carry himself?\"\n\n\"How would he look?\"\n\n\"How doth a nobleman look when he becomes a felon?\"\n\n\"Silence! Here they come!\"\n\nThe Serjeant-at-Arms once more stood up before the people and loudly\nread a proclamation, calling upon the Lieutenant of the Tower of London\nto return his precept and bring forth his prisoner.\n\nThis was responded to by a call of \"Present!\" from outside, followed by\na loud tumult. The next moment the great doors of the Hall were thrown\nopen, six armed men entered and walked straight up the centre aisle\ntowards the bar.\n\nBehind them appeared the Lieutenant of the Tower of London, with Lord\nRich, and between them was Robert d'Esclade, fifth Duke of Wessex, the\nprisoner.\n\nDressed all in black, he looked distinctly older than the crowd had\nremembrance of him. A sigh of excited anticipation went all along the\nline, a regular bousculade ensued; the people behind trying to catch a\nnearer glimpse of the Duke and pushing those who were in front. The\n'prentices, who were squatting in the foremost rank on the ground, were\nviolently jerked forward, some fell on their faces right up against the\nLieutenant and my lord Rich, seeing which and the general excited\nconfusion the Duke was observed to smile.\n\nA woman in the crowd murmured--\n\n\"The Lord bless his handsome face!\"\n\n\"Heaven ward Your Grace!\" added another.\n\nThe women's pity--and that only momentarily. And the awful publicity of\nit all! Among the men wagers were offered and taken in his hearing as he\npassed, whether sentence of death would be passed on him or not.\n\n\"Will they hang him, think you?\"\n\n\"No, no, 'tis always the axe for noble lords; but they'll have him drawn\nand quartered for sure.\"\n\n\"God help Your Grace!\" sighed the women.\n\nIndeed, if pride was a deadly sin, how deadly was its punishment now.\n\nThe crowd was not hostile, only indifferent, curious, eager to see; and\nevery remark made by these stolid gapers must have cut the prisoner like\na blow.\n\nThey watched him cross the entire length of the hall, commenting on his\nappearance, his clothes, his past life, a coarse jest even came to his\nears now and again, a laugh of derision or an exclamation of satisfied\nenvy.\n\nFallen Wessex indeed!\n\nHe tried with all his might not to show what he felt, and evidently he\nsucceeded over well, for Mr. Thomas Norton, in his comments on the\ntrial, states placidly:--\n\n\"The prisoner seemeth not to understand the gravity of his position and\ncareth naught for the heinousness of his crime. Truly this indifference\nmarketh a godless soul or else the supreme conceit of wealth and high\nrank, he having many friends among his peers and being confident of an\nacquittal.\"\n\nLord Rich alone, who walked by the side of the Duke, and stood close to\nhim throughout the awful ordeal, has noted in his interesting memoirs\nhow deeply the accused was moved when he realized that he would have to\nstand at the bar on a raised dais, in full view of all the crowd.\n\n\"Meseemed that his hand trembled when first he rested it on the bar,\"\nadds his lordship in his chronicles. \"He being passing tall he could be\nseen by all and sundry, which was trying to his pride. But anon His\nGrace caught my eye, and I doubt not but that he read therein all the\nsympathy which I felt for him, for he then threw back his head and\nscanned the crowd right fearlessly, and more like a king ready to read a\nproclamation than a felon awaiting his trial. Then, as he looked all\naround him, his eyes lighted on my lord the Cardinal de Moreno and on a\nveiled female figure who sat close to the Spanish envoy. He then became\ndeathly pale, and I, fearing that he might swoon, caught him by the arm.\nBut he pressed my hand and thanked me, saying only that the heat of the\nroom was oppressive.\"\n\nIt is evident that my lord Rich was a hot partisan of the accused. He\nand the Lieutenant of the Tower stood close beside the Duke throughout\nthe trial, the Tower guard forming a semicircle round the bar, and the\nChamberlain of the Tower holding the axe with its edge from the prisoner\nand towards Lord Rich.\n\nMr. Thomas Norton tells us that at this point of the proceedings the\nexcitement was intense. Lord Chandois himself seemed unable to keep up\nthe rigid dignity of his office. The peers who were the triers were\neagerly whispering to one another. The Clerk seemed unable to clear his\nthroat before calling on the accused.\n\nThe crowd too felt this acute tension. The people had already noticed\nthe veiled female figure, clad in sombre kirtle and black paniers, who\nhad entered the Hall a little while ago, accompanied by His Eminence the\nCardinal, and had since then sat, dull and rigid, beside him, seemingly\ntaking no notice of the proceedings. A hurried conversation carried on\nin whispers between His Eminence and my lord High Steward had been noted\nby everybody--yet no one dared to ask a question.\n\nIt seemed as if an invisible presence had suddenly made itself felt, a\nspirit from the land of shadows, that awesome precursor of death which\nis called \"Retribution,\" and that from his ghostly lips there had\nfallen--unheard yet felt by every heart--the mighty dictate of an\nalmighty will: \"Thou shalt do no murder!\"\n\nHad the spirit really passed? Who can tell? But the soul of every man\nand woman there was left quivering. There was not a hand that now did\nnot slightly tremble, not one lid that failed to move, for the supreme\nmoment had come for the accomplishment of an irreparable wrong.\n\nThe spectators had before them the picture of that solemn Court, the\nLord High Steward with chain and sword of gold, the judges in their red\nrobes, the peers with their ermine, and here and there quaint patches\nof unexpected colour as the wintry sun struck full through the coloured\nfacets of the huge window beyond and alighted on a black gown or the\nleather jerkins of the guard.\n\nThey saw the halberds of the men-at-arms faintly gleaming in the wan,\ngrey light, the Cardinal's purple robes, a brilliant note amidst the\ndull mass of browns and blacks; the blue doublet of Sir Henry\nBeddingfield, a jarring bit of discord between the sable-hued garb of\nthe other gentlemen there.\n\nAnd there, amongst them all, the tall, erect figure, the one quiet,\nimpassive face in this surging sea of excitement--the prisoner at the\nbar!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nTHE TRIAL\n\n\nThe excitement, great as it was, had perforce to be kept in check.\n\nThe Clerk of the Crown had collected his papers: he now stood up and\ncalled upon the accused:\n\n\"Robert, Duke of Wessex and of Dorchester, Earl of Launceston, Wexford\nand Bridthorpe, Baron of Greystone, Ullesthorpe and Edbrooke, Premier\nPeer of England, hold up thy right hand.\"\n\nThe prisoner having done so, Mr. Barham, the Queen's Sergeant, opened\nthe contents of the indictment.\n\n\"Whereas it is said that on the fourteenth day of October thou didst\nunlawfully kill Don Miguel, Marquis de Suarez, grandee of Spain and\nenvoy extraordinary of His Most Catholic Majesty the King of Spain, thou\nart therefore to make answer to this charge of murder. I therefore\ncharge thee once again: art thou guilty of this crime, whereof thou art\nindicted, yea or nay?\"\n\n\"I am guilty,\" replied Wessex firmly, \"and I have confessed.\"\n\n\"By whom wilt thou be tried?\"\n\n\"By God and by my peers.\"\n\n\"Before we proceed,\" continued the Sergeant, \"what sayest thou, Robert,\nDuke of Wessex, is that which thou hast confessed true?\"\n\n\"It is true.\"\n\n\"And didst thou confess it willingly and freely of thyself, or was there\nany extortion or unfair means to draw it from thee?\"\n\n\"Surely I made that confession freely,\" replied the prisoner, \"without\nany constraint, and that is all true.\"\n\n\"And hast thou read the depositions of those who were witness of thy\ncrime, and who have added their testimony to that which thine accusers,\nthe Queen's Commissioners, already know?\"\n\n\"I have not read those depositions, as there was no one present when Don\nMiguel died save I--his murderer--and God!\"\n\nAs Wessex made this last bold declaration, the Queen's Serjeant turned\ntowards His Eminence as if expecting guidance from that direction, but\nas nothing came he continued--\n\n\"I would have thee weigh well what thou sayest. Thine answers and\nconfessions, if spoken truthfully, will do much to mitigate the severity\nof the punishment which thy crime hath called forth.\"\n\n\"I will make mine own confession,\" retorted Wessex, with a sudden quick\nreturn to his own haughty manner. \"I pray you teach me not how to answer\nor confess. But because I was not cognizant whether my peers did know it\nall or not, I have made a short declaration of my doings with Don\nMiguel. That is the truth, my lords,\" he added, addressing his triers\nand judges on the bench, \"everything else which hath been added contrary\nto mine own confession is a lie and a perjury, as God here is my\nwitness.\"\n\n\"Thy confession is but a brief record of the fact, as the Clerk of the\nCrown will presently read. There is neither circumstance nor detail.\"\n\n\"And is it for circumstance or detail that I am being tried?\" rejoined\nWessex, \"or for the murder of Don Miguel de Suarez, to which I hereby\nplead guilty?\"\n\nThe Queen's Serjeant looked to Sir Robert Catline for guidance. The Lord\nChief Justice, however, was of opinion that the prisoner's confession\nmust be read first, before any further argument about it could be\nallowed.\n\nThe Clerk of the Crown then rose and began to read:--\n\n      \"The voluntary confession of Robert Duke of Wessex,\n      now a prisoner in the Tower, and accused of murder,\n      treason, and felony: made at the Tower of London on\n      the fifteenth day of October, 1553. I hereby\n      acknowledge and confess that on the fourteenth day of\n      October I did unlawfully kill Don Miguel, Marquis de\n      Suarez, by stabbing him in the back with my dagger.\n      For this murder I plead neither excuse nor\n      justification, and submit myself to a trial by my\n      peers and to the justice of this realm. So help me\n      God.\"\n\nThe bench, the entire hall, was crowded with the Duke's friends; with\nthe exception of a very small faction, who for reasons they deemed good\nand adequate desired the Spanish alliance, and the death of the man at\nthe bar, not a single man or woman present believed that that confession\nwas an expos\u00c3\u00a9 of the truth. The Serjeant himself, the Clerk of the\nCrown, the Attorney and Solicitor-General who represented the\nprosecution, knew that some mystery lurked behind that monstrous\nself-accusation. But it was so straightforward, so categorical, that\nunless some extraordinary event occurred, unless Wessex himself recanted\nthat confession, nothing could save him from its dire consequences.\n\nOh! if Wessex would but recant! No one would have disbelieved him\nthen--not that fickle, motley crowd surely, who with its own\ncharacteristic inconsequence had suddenly taken the accused to its\nheart.\n\n\"'Tis not true, Wessex!\" shouted a manly voice from the body of the\nhall.\n\n\"Deny it! deny it!\" came in a regular hubbub from the compact mass of\nthroats in the rear.\n\nThe Duke smiled, but did not move. Lord Rich, in his memoirs, here\npoints out that \"His Grace seemed all unconscious of his surroundings\nand like unto a wanderer in the land of dreams.\"\n\nBut the confession had aroused the opposition of the crowd, it was truly\npast honest men's belief. Every one murmured, and some chroniclers aver\nthat there was a regular tumult, more than encouraged by the Duke's\nfriends, and not checked even by the Lord High Steward himself.\n\nIn the turn of a hand public opinion had veered round. Forgetting that a\nwhile ago they were ready to hoot and mock the prisoner, the men now\nwere equally prepared to make a rush for the bar and drag him away from\nthat ignominious place, which they suddenly understood that he never\nshould have occupied.\n\nThe Serjeant-at-Arms had much ado to make himself heard. The guard had\nliterally to make an onslaught on the crowd. It was fully five or ten\nminutes before the noise subsided; then only did murmurs die down like\nthe roar of the sea when the surf recedes from the shore.\n\nIt was a brief lull, and Mr. Barham, the Queen's Serjeant, having once\nmore enjoined silence on behalf of Her Majesty's Commissioner, and on\npain of imprisonment, was at last able to continue his duties.\n\n\"It appeareth before you, my lords,\" he resumed in a loud, clear voice,\n\"that this man hath been indicted and arraigned of a most heinous crime,\nand hath confessed it before you, which is of record. Wherefore there\nresteth no more to be done but for the Court to give judgment\naccordingly, which here I require in the behalf of the Queen's\nMajesty.\"\n\nThe Lord High Steward rose and a gentleman usher took the white wand\nfrom him. He stood bareheaded, and every one in the Hall could see him.\n\n\"Robert, Duke of Wessex,\" he said, and his voice trembled as he spoke,\n\"Duke of Dorchester, Earl of Launceston, Wexford, and Bridthorpe, Baron\nof Greystone, Ullesthorpe, and Edbrooke, premier peer of England, what\nhave you to say why I may not proceed to judgment?\"\n\nThe last words almost sounded like an appeal, of friend to friend,\ncomrade to comrade. Lord Chandois' kindly eyes were fixed in deep sorrow\non the man whom he had loved and honoured sufficiently to wish to see\nhim on the throne of England.\n\nThere was an awed hush in the vast hall, and then a voice, clear and\ndistinct--a woman's voice--broke the momentous silence.\n\n\"The Duke of Wessex is innocent of the charge brought against him, as I\nhereby bear witness on his behalf.\"\n\nEven as the last bell-like tones echoed through the great chamber a\nyoung girl stepped forward, sable-clad and fragile-looking, but\nunabashed by the hundreds of eyes fixed eagerly upon her.\n\nIn the centre of the room she paused, and, throwing back the dark veil\nwhich enveloped her face, she looked straight up at my Lord High\nSteward.\n\n\"Who speaks?\" he asked in astonishment.\n\n\"I, Ursula Glynde,\" she replied firmly, \"daughter of the Earl of Truro.\"\n\nAt sound of her voice Wessex had started. His face became deathly pale\nand his hand gripped the massive bar of wood before him, until every\nmuscle and sinew in his arm creaked with the intensity of the effort. It\nwas only after she had spoken her own name that he seemed to pull\nhimself together, for he said--\n\n\"I pray your lordships not to listen. I desire no witnesses on my\nbehalf.\"\n\nHis temples had begun to throb, a wild horror seized him at thought of\nwhat she might do. And her appearance, too, had set his heart beating in\na veritable turmoil of emotions. For she stood now before him, before\nthem all, as the vision of purity and innocence which he had first\nlearnt to worship: that other self of hers, that mysterious, half-crazed\nbeing who had fooled and mocked him and then committed the awful crime\nfor which he stood self-convicted, that had vanished, leaving only this\ndelicate, ethereal being, the one whom he had clasped in his arms, whose\nblue eyes had gazed lovingly into his, whose lips had met his in that\none mad, passionate embrace.\n\nWhen he interposed thus coldly, impassively, she shuddered slightly but\nshe did not turn towards him, and he could only see the dainty outline\nof her fine profile, cut clear against a dark background of moving\nfigures beyond. From the table at which she herself had been sitting and\nwaiting all this while, and which was now in full view of the\nspectators, two advocates rose and joined the bench of judges. One of\nthem, after a brief consultation with the Clerk of the Crown, turned\nrespectfully towards the Lord High Steward.\n\n\"I humbly beseech your lordship,\" he said firmly, \"and you, my lords, to\nhear the evidence of the Lady Ursula Glynde. There has been no time to\nobtain a written deposition from her, for God at the eleventh hour hath\nthought fit to move her to speak that which she knows, so that a\ndreadful error may not be committed.\"\n\n\"This is a great breach of customary procedure,\" said Mr. Thomas\nBromley, the Solicitor-General, with a dubious shake of the head.\n\n\"Not so great as you would have us think, sir,\" commented Sir Robert\nCatline, \"for e'en in the trial of the late-lamented Queen Catherine of\nblessed memory, my lord of Uppingham, whose depositions could not be\ntaken previously, was nevertheless allowed to bear witness on behalf of\nthe accused.\"\n\nBut the opinion of the most learned lawyer in England would not now have\nbeen listened to, if it had been adverse to the present situation. Lords\nand judges, noblemen and spectators clamoured with every means at their\ncommand, short of absolute contempt of Court, that this new witness\nshould be heard.\n\n\"How say you, my lords?\" said the Lord High Steward eagerly, \"bearing in\nmind the opinion of our learned colleague, ought we to hear this lady or\nno?\"\n\n\"Aye! aye!\" came from every voice on the bench.\n\n\"By Our Lady! I protest!\" said Wessex loudly.\n\n\"We will hear this lady,\" pronounced the Lord High Steward. \"Let her\nstep forward and be made to swear the truth of her assertions.\"\n\nUrsula came forward a step or two. Mr. Thomas Wilbraham,\nAttorney-General of the Court of Wards, who was sitting close by, held\nout a small wooden crucifix towards her. She took it and kissed it\nreverently.\n\n\"You are the Lady Ursula Glynde,\" queried Lord Chandois, \"maid-of-honour\nto the Queen's Majesty?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"Then do I charge you to speak the truth, the whole truth, and naught\nbut the truth, so help you God.\"\n\n\"My lords,\" protested Wessex hotly, for his brain was in a whirl. He\ncould not allow her to speak and accuse herself of her crime--she, the\nangel side of her, taking upon herself the evil committed by that\nmysterious second self over which she had no control. It was too\nhorrible! And all these people gaping at her made his blood tingle with\nshame. What he had readily borne himself, the disgrace, the staring\ncrowd, the pity and inquisitiveness of the multitude, that he felt he\ncould not endure for her.\n\nAlready, as he saw her now, his heart had forgiven her everything;\ngladly, joyously would he die now, since he had seen her once more as\nshe really was, pure and undefiled by contact with the ignoble wretch\nwhom, in a moment of madness, she had sent to his death.\n\nHe protested with all his might. But it was his own past life, his\nfriends, his popularity, which now literally conspired against him, and\ncaused his judges to turn a deaf ear to his entreaties.\n\n\"My lord of Wessex,\" said the High Steward sternly, \"in the name of\njustice and for the dignity of this court, I charge you to be silent.\"\n\nThen he once more addressed the Lady Ursula.\n\n\"Say on, lady. This court will hear you.\"\n\nShe waited a few moments, whilst every spectator there seemed to hear\nhis own heart beat with the intensity of his excitement. Then she began\nspeaking in a firm and even voice, somewhat low at first, but gaining in\nstrength and volume as she proceeded.\n\n\"I would have you know, my lords,\" she said, \"that at midnight on the\nfourteenth day of October, being in the Audience Chamber at Hampton\nCourt Palace, in the company of Don Miguel de Suarez .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nShe paused suddenly and seemed to sway. Mr. Thomas Wilbraham ran to her,\noffering her a chair, which she declined with a quick wave of the hand.\n\n\"My lords,\" said Wessex, quietly and earnestly, during the brief lull\ncaused by this interruption, \"I entreat you in the name of justice, do\nnot hear this lady; she is excited and overwrought and knows not the\npurport of what she is saying. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. You see for yourselves she is\nscarce conscious of her actions. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I have made full confession\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. there rests nothing to be done. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"Prisoner at the bar,\" said the Lord High Steward, \"I charge you to be\nsilent. Lady Ursula, continue.\"\n\nAnd Wessex perforce had to hold his peace, whilst Ursula resumed her\ntale more calmly.\n\n\"Being in company of Don Miguel, who spoke words of love to me .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and\nanon did hold me in his arms .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. when I tried to escape .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. he would not let me go .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. he .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. he .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. your\nlordships, have patience with me, I pray you .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" she added in tones\nof intense pathos as the monstrous lie she was so sublimely forcing\nherself to utter seemed suddenly to be choking her. Then she continued\nspeaking quickly, lest perhaps she might waver before the end.\n\n\"His Grace of Wessex did come upon us, and seeing me held with violence,\nI, who was his betrothed, to save mine honour, the Duke did strike Don\nMiguel down.\"\n\nThere was dead silence as the young girl had finished speaking. Wessex\nwas staring at her, and Mr. Thomas Norton assures us that he burst out\nlaughing, a laugh which the Queen's printer stigmatizes as \"heartless\nand unworthy a high-born gentleman! for truly,\" he continues, \"the Lady\nUrsula Glynde was moved by the spirit of God in thus making a tardy\nconfession, and His Grace, methinks, should have shown a proper spirit\nof reverence before this manifestation of God.\"\n\nBut if Wessex laughed at this supreme and palpitating moment, surely his\nlaugh must have come from the very bitterness of his soul. As far as he\nknew Ursula had told nothing but a strangely concocted lie. To him, who\nhad--as he thought--seen her with the blood of Don Miguel still warm\nupon her hands, this extraordinary tale of threatened honour and timely\ninterference was but a tangled tissue of wanton falsehoods--another in\nthe long series which she had told to him.\n\nAnd purposeless too!\n\nHe had no idea of any sacrifice on her part, and merely looked upon her\npresent action as a weak attempt to save him from the gallows and no\nmore.\n\nShe just liked him well enough apparently not to wish to see him hang,\nbut that was all. And this suddenly struck him as ridiculous, paltry,\nand childish, a silly bravado which caused him to laugh. Perhaps she\ndesired to save him publicly at slight cost to herself, in order that\nshe might yet occupy one day the position which she had so avowedly\ncoveted since her childhood--that of Duchess of Wessex!\n\nIt was indeed more than ridiculous.\n\nThe stain of murder, which was really on her hands, she was full willing\nthat it should rest on him, only slightly palliated by the lie which she\nhad told.\n\nStrange, strange perversion of a girlish soul!\n\nWith dulled ears and brain in a turmoil Wessex only partly heard the\nquestions and cross-questions which his judges now put to her. She never\nwavered from her original story, but repeated it again and again,\ncircumstantially and without hesitation. Never once did she look towards\nthe bar.\n\n\"Lady Ursula Glynde,\" said Lord Chandois finally and with solemn\nearnestness, \"do you swear upon your honour and conscience that you have\nspoken the truth?\"\n\nAnd she replied equally solemnly--\n\n\"I swear it upon mine honour and conscience.\"\n\n\"'Tis false from beginning to end,\" protested Wessex loudly.\n\nUrsula made a low obeisance before my Lord High Steward. The crucifix\nwas once more held up to her and she kissed it reverently. With that\npious kiss she reached at that moment the highest pinnacle of her\nsacrifice--she gave up to the man she loved the very spotlessness of her\nsoul. For his sake she had lied and spoken a false oath--she had sinned\nin order that he might be saved.\n\nAnd even now she also reached the greatest depth of her own misery, for,\nas she told her tale before his judges and before _him_, she half\nexpected that he would exonerate her from the odious accusations which\nshe was bringing against herself.\n\nThe story which she had told had been in accordance with the Cardinal's\nsuggestions, but she herself was quite convinced that Don Miguel had\nfallen by a woman's hand. Wessex would never have hit another man in the\nback--that was woman's work, and she who had done it was so dear to him,\nthat he was sacrificing life and honour in order to shield her.\n\nAye! more than that! for was he not acting a coward's part by allowing\nUrsula Glynde to sacrifice her fair name for the sake of a wanton?\n\nAnd thus these two people who loved one another more than life, honour,\nand happiness, were face to face now with that terrible misunderstanding\nbetween them:--still further apart from each other than they had ever\nbeen, both suffering acutely in heart and mind for the supposed\ncowardice and wantonness of the other, and the while my Lord High\nSteward and the other noble lords were concluding the ceremonies of that\nstrange, eventful trial.\n\n\"My lords,\" said Lord Chandois, once more rising from his seat, \"you\nhave heard the evidence of this lady, and Robert Duke of Wessex having\nput himself upon the trial of God and you his peers, I charge you to\nconsider if it appeareth that he is guilty of this murder or whether he\nhad justification, and thereupon say your minds upon your honour and\nconsciences.\"\n\nWe have Mr. Thomas Norton's authority for stating that my lords, the\ntriers, never left their seats, nor did they deliberate. Hardly were the\nwords out of my Lord High Steward's lips than with one accord\nfour-and-twenty voices were raised saying--\n\n\"Not guilty!\"\n\n\"Then,\" adds Mr. Norton, \"there was a cheer raised from the people\ninside the Hall which was quite deafening to the ears. Sundry tossed\ntheir caps into the air, and many of the women began to cry. My Lord\nHigh Steward could not make himself heard for a long while, at which he\nbecame very wrathful, and, calling to the Serjeant-at-Arms, he bade him\nclear the Court of all these noise-makers.\"\n\nThere seems to have been considerable difficulty in doing this, for Mr.\nThomas Norton continuously refers to \"riotous conduct,\" and even to\n\"contempt of the Queen's Commissioner.\" Cheers of \"God save Wessex!\"\nalternated with the loyal cry of \"God save the Queen.\" The men-at-arms\nhad to use their halberds, and did so very effectually, one or two of\nthe more excited \"noise-makers\" getting wounded about the face and\nhands. Finally the suggestion came from Mr. Barham, the Queen's\nSerjeant, that His Grace of Wessex should be concealed from the view of\nthe populace, and, acting upon this advice, the Lieutenant of the Tower\nordered his guard to close around the bar, whilst a low seat was\nprovided for His Grace. The object of this mad enthusiasm being thus\nplaced out of sight, the people became gradually more calm, and the\nnoise subsided sufficiently for the Queen's Serjeant to give forth his\nfinal dictum.\n\n\"My Lord's Grace, the Queen's Commissioner, High Steward of England,\nchargeth all persons to depart in God's peace and the Queen's, and hath\ndissolved this Commission!\"\n\n\"God save the Queen!\" was shouted lustily, and then the great door was\nopened and the people began quietly to file out.\n\nThe pale November sun had struggled out of its misty coverings, and\ntouched the pinnacles and towers of the old Abbey with delicate gleams\nof golden grey. Slowly the crowd moved on, some of the more venturesome\nor more enthusiastic townsfolk, the 'prentices, and younger men,\nlingered round the precincts to see the great personages come out and to\ngive a final cheer for His Grace of Wessex.\n\nThe Hall itself seemed lonely now that the people had gone. The Lord\nHigh Steward once more called on the prisoner, who had already risen as\nsoon as his noisy partisans had departed.\n\nAs he had been impassive throughout the terrible ordeal of this trial\nfor his life, so he remained now that on every face before him he read\nthe inevitable acquittal. He had watched Ursula Glynde's graceful figure\nas, accompanied by the Cardinal de Moreno, she had finally made an\nobeisance before the judges, then had retired through the doors of the\nLord Chancellor's Court.\n\nA great and awful disgust filled his whole heart. It was he now who was\nconscious of the loathsome web, which had enveloped him more completely\nthan he had ever anticipated.\n\nHe saw his acquittal hovering on the lips of his peers. Lord Chandois'\nkindly face was beaming with delight, Sir Robert Catline and Mr. Gilbert\nGerard were conversing quite excitedly: his own friends, Sir Henry\nBeddingfield and Lord Mordaunt, Lord Huntingdon and Sir John Williams,\nwere openly expressing their intense satisfaction.\n\nBut for him, what did it all mean? An acquittal based on a lie, and that\nlie told by a woman to save him!\n\nBut a lie for all that, and one which he could not refute, without\ntelling the whole truth to his judges and branding _her_ publicly as a\nmurderess and worse.\n\nHe, who had ever held his own honour, his pride, the cleanness of his\nwhole existence as a fetish to be worshipped, now saw himself forced to\nbarter all that which he held so sacred and gain his own life in\nexchange. How much more gladly would he have heard his death-sentence\npronounced now by his friend's kind lips. Death--however\nignominious--would have purified and exalted honour.\n\nMechanically he listened to Lord Chandois' speech, and mechanically he\nprotested. The web was tightly woven around him, and he was powerless to\ntear it asunder.\n\n\"Robert Duke of Wessex and of Dorchester,\" said the Lord High Steward,\n\"Earl of Launceston, Wexford, and Bridthorpe, Baron of Greystone,\nUllesthorpe and Edbrooke, premier peer of England, the lords, your\npeers, have found you not guilty of this crime of murder.\"\n\n\"My lords,\" said Wessex in a final appeal, which he himself felt was a\nhopeless one, \"I thank you from my heart, but I cannot accept this\ndecision; it is based on a falsehood, the hysterical outpourings of a\nmisguided heart, and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nBut already the Lord High Steward had interrupted him.\n\n\"My lord Duke,\" he said, \"the tale this lady hath at last spoken in open\nCourt was one guessed at by all your friends; she hath not only followed\nthe dictates of her conscience, but hath taken a heavy burden from the\nhearts of your triers, and one which would have saddened many of us,\neven to our graves. Had it been my terrible duty to pass death-sentence\nupon you, which had the lady not spoken I should have been bound to do,\nI myself would have felt akin to a murderer. We cannot but thank heaven\nthat Lady Ursula's heart was touched at the eleventh hour, and that you\nwere not allowed to sacrifice your honour and your life in so worthless\na cause.\"\n\n\"But I cannot allow you to believe, nor you, my lords .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" further\nprotested the Duke.\n\n\"Nay, my lord, we only believe one thing, and that is that Your Grace\nleaves this Court this day with the respect and admiration of all men in\nthe land, with unsullied honour, and with stainless name. All else we\nare content shall remain a mystery betwixt Lady Ursula Glynde and her\nconscience.\"\n\n\"God save the Queen,\" added the Lord High Steward as he broke the white\nwand.\n\n\"And,\" adds Mr. Thomas Norton, \"thus ended the trial of His Grace of\nWessex and of Dorchester, on a charge of murder, treason, and felony.\nSurrounded by his friends, cheered by the mob, the Duke left Westminster\nHall a free man, but as I watched his face, meseemed that I saw thereon\nsuch strange melancholy and a hue like that of death. He smiled to my\nlord Huntingdon and spoke long and earnestly with my lord Rich. He had\nmighty cause to be thankful to God and to his friends for his acquittal,\nyet meseemed almost as if he rebelled against his happy fate, and I\nhereby bear witness that the blood of the Spanish envoy must still have\nclung to His Grace's hands. In just cause or in unjust no man shall take\nanother's life wantonly, and I doubt not but His Grace's conscience will\ntrouble him unto his death.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nAFTERWARDS\n\n\nEscorted throughout the journey home by His Eminence, Ursula had not\nuttered one word. She sat in the barge, gazing out along the river, her\nveil closely drawn over her head, lest prying eyes noted the expression\non her face.\n\nShe was as one who had seen all that she held most dear dying before her\neyes. She had made her sacrifice willingly, had offered up her fair\nname, her every feminine instinct of honour and modesty upon the altar\nof her love. She had by that sublime holocaust offered up to God a\nthanksgiving for two brief hours of happiness which she had enjoyed.\n\nHow far, far away those transient moments seemed now to be. That\nhalf-hour in the park of old Hampton Court, with the nightingale singing\nits sweet song as an accompaniment to the great hosanna which filled her\nheart. She closed her eyes, for her heart ached nigh to bursting when\nshe remembered that first touch of his hand upon hers, the gay, merry\nwords which fell from his lips, the passionate ardour which gleamed in\nhis eyes.\n\nOh God! she had worshipped one of Thy creatures and found him less than\nhuman after all. The murmur of the river as the boat glided along\nrecalled to her those few moments among the rushes, when a golden\nOctober sun was sinking slowly in the west, and the water-fowl were\ncalling to their mates, while she leant back in a boat, lulled by the\npeace of that exquisite hour, rocked to blissful rest by the gentle\nmotion of the river, and dreaming of heaven, for he sat opposite to her,\nand every look of his told her that he thought her fair.\n\nOh God! she had worshipped one of Thy creatures! How great is Thy\nvengeance now!\n\nHe was false to love! false to her!\n\nAll jealousy had died from her heart. Her pain now was because he was\nfalse. She had forgotten the other woman, she only remembered him--that\nhe did not love her, that he had accepted her sacrifice, and laughed\nbitterly, cruelly, when first she told her sublime lie for his sake.\n\nAt the Water Gate of the Palace the barge drew up and Ursula prepared to\nalight. She had spent the short moments of the transit between\nWestminster and Hampton Court in these heart-breaking daydreams. She\nhardly realized where she was and what she was doing. Once only, when\nfirst the cupolas of the Palace detached themselves from out the mist,\nshe had felt such a desperate pain in her heart, that for a moment the\nwild hope came to her that God would be merciful and would allow her to\ndie.\n\nBut when she alighted she suddenly became conscious that the Cardinal de\nMoreno was standing before her, his delicate white hand outstretched to\nhelp her to step ashore. She shrank away from him as from a viper who\nhad stung her and might sting her again. Not understanding his attitude,\nnor the motives which had led him to suggest to her the lie that had\nsaved Wessex, she yet knew by instinct that this purple-clad, benevolent\nperson, this kindly and courteous diplomatist was a thing of evil which\nhad first polluted and then killed her love.\n\nHis Eminence smiled--a kind, indulgent smile--when he saw the quick\nlook of horror in the young girl's face, and he said very gently--\n\n\"Will you not allow me, my daughter, to accompany you to your\napartments? The Queen, remember, hath confided you to my charge; I would\nwish to see you safely in Her Grace of Lincoln's care.\"\n\n\"Your Eminence does me too much honour,\" she said coldly. \"I can find my\nway alone through the Water Gallery.\"\n\n\"Yet Her Majesty, meseems, will not allow her maids-of-honour to walk\nunattended in this part of the grounds,\" he added, with a slight touch\nof benevolent sarcasm.\n\n\"My comings and goings have ceased to interest Her Majesty,\" rejoined\nUrsula quietly, \"and I am no longer of sufficient importance to require\nwatching or to demand an escort.\"\n\n\"Well, as you will, my daughter. It is not for me to force my presence\nupon you, though, believe me, I would have wished to serve you.\"\n\nHe was about to beckon to his retinue, who had stood respectfully aside\nduring this brief colloquy, when with a quick, wholly unexpected\nmovement, the young girl placed her hand upon his arm and forced him\nonce more to turn and face her.\n\n\"Your Eminence would wish to serve me?\" she said, speaking rapidly and\nwith a strange, peremptory ring in her voice.\n\n\"Can you doubt it, my child?\" he replied urbanely.\n\n\"No,\" she said firmly, \"for there is that between Your Eminence and me\nwhich, if known to the Queen of England, would for ever ruin your\nposition in any court of Europe.\"\n\n\"You would find it difficult .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" he began, whilst a slight look--oh,\na mere shade!--of fear seemed to creep into his eyes.\n\n\"Nay! I was not thinking of betraying Your Eminence, nor the trap which\nyou set for me, into which I was full willing to fall. I merely\nmentioned the existence of this secret for the awakening of your own\nconscience and because I have need of a service from you.\"\n\n\"I will endeavour to fulfil your behests, my child.\"\n\n\"I desire three words with His Grace of Wessex this afternoon.\"\n\n\"My child .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0!\" he ejaculated, with still a tone of nervousness\nperceptible in his voice, and a trace of that newly awakened fear\nlurking in the anxious look which he cast upon her.\n\nBut she seemed quite self-possessed, and almost commanding as one who\nhad the right to demand obedience. The Cardinal did not quite know how\nto read her character at this moment. There was no doubt that if she\nchose to betray the part which he had played in her voluntary\nself-immolation, there would be plenty of people at the English Court\nonly too ready to believe her, or at any rate to seem to do so. The\nQueen of England herself would lend a willing ear to any tale which\nwould release her from her promise, with a semblance of honour to\nherself. His Grace of Wessex stood fully exonerated now, and in the face\nof so much humiliation the Cardinal would find it impossible to demand a\nfresh trial, whilst Mary Tudor had probably already repented of her\npledge to marry King Philip of Spain.\n\nOn the other hand, was it not dangerous to allow an interview to take\nplace between Wessex and Ursula? In a flash the Cardinal reviewed the\nsituation, and weighed all the consequences of the two courses thus\nopened before him--acquiescence and negation, and with his usual\nquickness of intellect he decided that acquiescence would be least\ndangerous. All he wanted was the time in which he could obtain the\nQueen's actual signature to her pledge. Once that was done, Mary Tudor\nwould never go back on her royal sign-manual. In any case not much harm\ncould be done in a brief interview. Both Wessex and Ursula were so far\nfrom guessing the truth, so ignorant of the tangled meshes of the\nintrigue in which they were still being held, that it would undoubtedly\nrequire the testimony of a third person at least, to bring daylight into\nthe black shadows of the mystery.\n\nTherefore His Eminence, after these few seconds of serious thought,\nresumed his kind, suave manner and, dismissing all fears from his mind,\nplaced his services with alacrity at Lady Ursula's disposal.\n\n\"But I fear me,\" he added reflectively, \"that you place too much\nreliance upon my humble powers. His Grace of Wessex is not like to\nlisten to me, and meseems that you could more easily obtain an interview\nwith him through your own influence, which just now should be boundless,\nif the Duke has any gratitude in his heart.\"\n\n\"Your Eminence seems to be the prime mover in this drama of puppets,\"\nrejoined Ursula drily, \"and the Queen will put every obstacle in my way\nunless Your Eminence interferes.\"\n\n\"Your confidence honours me, my daughter; I will do my humble best\nbeside Her Majesty, and you can do the rest. But this, on one\ncondition.\"\n\n\"Name it.\"\n\n\"That you will have patience until to-morrow. His Grace arrives at the\nPalace to-night, Her Majesty will no doubt honour him specially; there\nmay be festivities to-morrow afternoon. I think I can so contrive it\nthat you have ten minutes alone then with His Grace.\"\n\nShe bent her head in acquiescence, and then stepped back so as to\nintimate to him that this interview was at an end.\n\n\"Be prudent, my daughter,\" he added, as he finally turned to go, \"and\nremember that a sin is best atoned for by humility and silence.\"\n\n\"At what hour can I rely on Your Eminence's promise to-morrow?\" she\nrejoined, calmly ignoring his urbane speech.\n\n\"In the early part of the afternoon, if God will grant me power.\"\n\n\"Your Eminence had best pray for that power then,\" she added finally.\n\nThe Cardinal took leave of her with his usual dignified benevolence. It\ndid not suit him at present to appear to be taking notice of her thinly\nveiled threats. He did not think that she would actually betray him,\neven if she did talk to His Grace for a few moments, for to betray the\nlie would mean also to acknowledge her love and her jealousy, and proud\nUrsula Glynde would never suffer that humiliation.\n\nThe situation was delicate and difficult, more so perhaps than it had\never been, but the next few hours should see the Queen of England's\nsignature at the bottom of a bond.\n\nThoughtfully His Eminence began walking along the Water Gallery, whilst\nUrsula quietly watched his purple robes gliding along the flagged\ncorridor.\n\nShe too had gained her wish--to see and speak to Wessex. What would she\nsay? and how would he reply? Vaguely she wondered if she would have the\nstrength to show him the contempt which she felt for his cowardice, and\ninwardly prayed for the strength not to let him see how much she loved\nhim still.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\nTHE CARDINAL'S PUPPETS\n\n\nHis Eminence the Cardinal de Moreno knew well how to gauge the moods and\ntempers of the English people of his time. He had rightly guessed that\nthe Duke of Wessex, whom but a few hours ago his countrymen were ready\nto condemn to a shameful death, would remain the hero of the hour, until\nthe enthusiasm of his friends had once more cooled down to a more normal\npitch.\n\nMary Tudor was deeply grateful to the Cardinal, for what she truly\nbelieved was a wonderful triumph of persuasion over the obstinacy of a\nguilty conscience. If in her innermost heart she bitterly resented the\nfact that Wessex owed his acquittal to outside influences rather than to\nthe will of his Queen, she nevertheless was ready enough to acknowledge\nhow completely His Eminence had succeeded, and how little ground she had\nfor not keeping her share of the momentous compact which she had made\nwith him.\n\n\"If Your Eminence is instrumental in saving His Grace from the block I\nwill marry King Philip of Spain!\"\n\nThat was her bond, and already the Cardinal had claimed its fulfilment.\nThe Queen of England stood definitely pledged to give her hand to Philip\nII, King of Spain.\n\nThe Spanish alliance, so much dreaded by the patriotic faction of\nEngland, was all but an accomplished fact. Bitter disappointment reigned\nin the hearts of all those who had hoped to see an English peer upon\nthe English throne. Yet all Wessex' friends were bound to admit that\nfrom the very moment when the Duke's acquittal suddenly roused all their\ndormant hopes, one look at his face had sufficed to tell them that those\nsame hopes had been born but to die again. There stood a man, broken in\nhealth and spirits, tired of life, without buoyancy or youth, or that\ndelightful vigour which had made the name of Wessex sound a note of\ngladness throughout the land.\n\nEven as he stepped down from the bar and his adherents showered good\nwishes upon him, he looked twenty years older than he had done on that\nbright happy day a fortnight ago when, the cynosure of all eyes, the\nmost brilliant ornament of that gorgeous court, he seemed to stand\nsmiling on the steps of the throne, gently dallying with a crown.\n\nYet Mary Tudor, wilfully forgetting for the moment her pledge to the\nSpaniards, longing to enjoy these last few hours when she was still\nfree, had showered smiles, f\u00c3\u00aates, honours upon the man she loved, happy\nto feel his lips pressed upon her hand in loyalty and gratitude.\n\nShe had never inquired of him how much real truth there was in the story\nwhich Ursula Glynde had told in open court. Perhaps she did not care to\nknow. She was weak enough--woman enough--to rejoice at the thought of\nher rival's complete humiliation. She was content to let the events of\nthat fateful night remain completely wrapped in mystery. Vaguely she\nfelt that in some sort of way the elucidation of it would not be\naltogether detrimental to Ursula Glynde, at the same time she knew that\nnever now could the young girl, who had come between her and the man she\nloved, aspire to become Duchess of Wessex.\n\nThe scandal had been too great, and unless some unexpected and\nwonderful thing happened, which would signally clear Ursula's maiden\nfame, she would for ever remain under the ban of this mystery which had\nbesmirched her good name.\n\nUrsula had been quite right when she asserted with bitter sarcasm that\nHis Eminence the Cardinal de Moreno seemed to be the prime mover in the\ngame of puppets, which was now proceeding within the precincts of the\nPalace. With the royal signature appended to his bond, he felt that his\nposition was now impregnable, and he moved about among the English lords\nand courtiers as a vice-regent would in the absence of a king.\n\nThe fact that a messenger from Scotland had arrived in the morning with\nnews of the ambassadors to the Queen Regent, without any mention of\neither Lord Pembroke's or Lord Everingham's sudden departure from\nthence, had completely calmed any fears he still might have of the\nlatter's too sudden reappearance at Hampton Court. In any case now he\nhad still some days before him during which he could consolidate his\nsuccess, by establishing direct intercourse between King Philip and the\nQueen of England. He hoped before many hours had elapsed to obtain from\nMary Tudor an actual letter, writ in her own hand to her royal\nbetrothed.\n\nThus secure in his invulnerable position, the Cardinal had thought it\nprudent as well as expedient to accede to Ursula's wishes, which seemed\nvery like commands, and he had used his diplomatic skill to good purpose\nin persuading Mary Tudor to allow the interview between the young girl\nand His Grace.\n\nAt the same time His Eminence was sufficiently wary so to manipulate his\npuppets that the interview should be of the briefest, and in this he was\nlike enough to succeed.\n\nIt was in order to celebrate the happy return of His Grace to Court\nthat the Queen had, at his request, granted a free pardon to all those\nwho were to be brought for trial on the same day as the Duke. Two\no'clock in the afternoon of the day following this great event, had been\nfixed when all these poor people, vagrants and beggars mostly, one or\ntwo political prisoners, perhaps, were to thank His Grace for their\nfreedom publicly in the grounds of the Palace.\n\nThe Cardinal, well aware of this, skilfully working too on the Queen's\nstill restive jealousy, had suggested to Mary that Ursula Glynde should\nawait the Duke of Wessex in the hall at fifteen minutes before the hour.\n\n\"A quarter of an hour, Your Majesty,\" he said insinuatingly, when first\non that same morning he had broached the subject, \"fifteen short\nminutes, during which the breach 'twixt His Grace and a disgraced maiden\ncan but be irretrievably widened.\"\n\n\"Your Eminence seems to think that I desire a breach,\" retorted Mary\nwith Tudor-like haughtiness.\n\n\"Far from me even to think such a thought,\" rejoined the Cardinal\nblandly; \"but as a faithful servant of Your Majesty, soon to become a\nloyal subject when Your Grace is Queen of Spain, I hold the welfare of\nall those whom you deign to honour very much at heart. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. And I was\nthinking of His Grace of Wessex.\"\n\n\"What of him, my lord?\"\n\n\"The Duke is proud, Your Majesty; would it be well, think you, if a girl\nof Lady Ursula Glynde's reputation were to become Duchess of Wessex?\"\n\n\"Think you she hath the desire?\"\n\n\"_Quien sabe?_\" he replied guardedly, \"but an Your Majesty will trust my\njudgment, a brief interview with His Grace would soon scatter her hopes\nto the winds.\"\n\nThus did this astute diplomatist play upon every fibre of a woman's\nemotions. His calculations were made to a nicety--only the interview\nwhich Ursula had demanded and no more! This to pacify the young girl in\ncase she became defiant, but the meeting itself just short enough to\navoid any harm.\n\nAt twenty minutes before two, Ursula was bidden to the Great Hall by\ncommand of Her Majesty. The Duchess of Lincoln--tearful and\nkind--received her in the great window embrasure. Her motherly heart\nached to see the bitter sorrow of the beautiful girl, who had been so\nfull of vitality and merriment a brief fortnight ago.\n\nWith a strange instinct, which she herself could not have explained,\nUrsula had dressed herself all in white. A rich brocaded kirtle and\nshimmery silken paniers seemed to accentuate the dull pallor of her\ncheeks. Only her golden hair gave a brilliant note of colour and of life\nto this marble statue, who seemed only to exist through its blue\nmagnetic eyes.\n\n\"The page has gone to bid His Grace of Wessex attend upon you here, my\nchild,\" said the good old Duchess, as she took Ursula's cold hands in\nhers, and mechanically stroked them with her own kind, wrinkled palms.\n\n\"Think you he will come?\" asked Ursula dully.\n\n\"I doubt not but he will, my dear. His Grace owes you his life.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"But before he comes, my treasure,\" murmured the dear old soul, \"I would\nhave you know that I'll never believe aught, save that you are good and\npure. Some day, perhaps, you will love me well enough to tell me the\nsecret which is gnawing at your heart.\"\n\nShe paused, quite frightened at the expression of intense soul-agony\nwhich was suddenly apparent in every line of the wan young face.\n\nUrsula bent her tall, graceful figure, and raising the gentle motherly\nhands to her hot lips she kissed them with passionate tenderness.\n\n\"In God's name, my dear, kind Duchess,\" she murmured, \"do not speak soft\nwords to me. The Holy Virgin has helped me to keep calm; I must not\nbreak down .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. not now .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. that he is coming.\"\n\nNow there was the sound of firm footsteps crossing the chamber beyond.\nUrsula drew herself up, and for a moment a strange, scared expression\ncame into her face, then one of intense, yet inexpressible tenderness.\n\nMutely she beckoned to the old Duchess, who, understanding this earnest\nappeal, withdrew without uttering another word.\n\nThe next moment the door at the further end of the hall was opened. A\npage loudly announced--\n\n\"His Grace the Duke of Wessex!\"\n\nAnd for the first time since the awful moment when alien intrigues had\nparted them, these two, who had so fondly loved, so deeply suffered,\nwere alone, face to face at last.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nTHE LAST FAREWELL\n\n\nShe saw in a moment how much older he looked, and quaintly wondered\nwhether the black doublet and cloak caused him to seem so. Harry\nPlantagenet--happiest of dogs now that his master roamed about with him\nonce more--walked with a proud step beside him.\n\nShe looked such a dainty picture, framed in the rich embrasure of the\ngreat window, her graceful figure with its crown of gold looking\nmajestic and noble on the raised dais, ethereal and almost ghostlike,\nwith its rich white draperies.\n\nJust for one moment as Wessex entered the room the events of the last\nfortnight suddenly vanished from his memory. She was there before him,\nin that same soft gown of white, as she had stood that day, with a sheaf\nof roses in her arms--or were they marguerites?--and once more, as he\nhad done then, he vaguely wondered what colour were her eyes. On his\nlips he seemed to feel again the savour of her passionate kiss, and once\nagain to smell the perfume of her golden hair as for that one brief,\nheavenly minute she had lain next to his heart.\n\nBut reality--wanton, crude, and cruel--chased this brief, happy vision\naway with one cut of her swishing lash, and then brought before his eyes\nthat same face and form, but with wild, restless eyes, bare neck and\nbosom, and with the Spaniard's hand resting masterfully on her\nshoulder. And Ursula, who had watched him keenly, saw the cold,\ncontemptuous look in his eyes, the shudder which shook his powerful\nframe as he approached her, and she even seemed actually to be touching\nthat stony barrier of wilful self-control, which he interposed between\nhimself and her.\n\nBut the obeisance which he made to her was profound and full of cold\nrespect.\n\n\"You desired to speak with me, lady?\" he said. \"My life, which you have\ndeigned to save, is entirely at your service.\"\n\nShe had stepped down from the dais as he approached, calling upon every\nfibre within her, upon every power granted to a woman who loves to touch\nthe heart of the loved one. Though she knew that for ever after, he and\nshe would henceforth be parted, her heart had so yearned for him that\nvaguely she had begun to delude herself with the hope that after all\nonly a great misunderstanding existed between him and her, and that\nbefore they spoke the last words of farewell their hands would meet just\nonce again--only as friends--only as comrades perhaps--but closely,\ntrustfully for all that.\n\nIt was solely in this hope that she had begged for an interview.\n\nHis coldness chilled her. Now that he was near her again, she once more\nbecame conscious of that bitter feeling of awful jealousy which had\ncaused her the most exquisite heart-ache which a human being could be\ncalled upon to endure. Memory brought back to her the vision of another\nwoman--an unknown creature whom he loved, to the destruction of his own\nsoul and honour.\n\nAnd with the advent of this memory the tender appeal died upon her lips,\nand she only said in a hard, callous voice--\n\n\"Is that all that Your Grace would say to me?\"\n\n\"Nay, indeed,\" he replied with the same icy calm, \"there is much I ought\nto say, is there not? I should tell you how grateful I am for my life,\nwhich I owe to you. And yet I cannot even find it in my heart to say\n'thank you' for so worthless a gift.\"\n\n\"Does life then seem so bitter now that the woman you love has proved a\nwanton and a coward?\" she retorted vehemently.\n\nHe looked at her, a little puzzled by her tone, then said quietly--\n\n\"Nay! the woman I loved has proved neither a wanton nor a coward .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nonly an illusion, a sweet dream of youth and innocence, which I, poor\nfool, mistook for reality.\"\n\nThere was such an infinity of sadness, of deception, and of\nlife-enduring sorrow in his voice as he spoke that every motherly\ninstinct, never far absent from a true woman's heart, was aroused in\nhers in an instant. She forgot her bitterness in the intensity of her\ndesire to comfort him, and she said quite gently--\n\n\"You loved her very dearly, then?\"\n\n\"I worshipped my dream, but 'tis gone.\"\n\n\"Already?\" she asked, not understanding.\n\nAnd he, not comprehending, replied--\n\n\"Nothing flies so quickly as an illusion when it is on the wing.\"\n\nThen he added more lightly--\n\n\"But I pray you, do not think of that. I am grateful to you--very\ngrateful. Your ladyship hath deigned to send for me. What do you desire\nof me? My name and protection are now at your service, and I am\nready--whenever you wish it--to fulfil the promise our fathers made on\nour behalf.\"\n\nShe drew back as if a poisoned adder had stung her.\n\nAt first she had not realized what he meant to say; then the intention\ndawned upon her and the insult nearly knocked her down like a blow. She\ncould hardly speak, her own words seemed to choke her; her rich young\nblood flew to her pallid cheeks and dyed them with the crimson hue of\nshame.\n\n\"You would .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0?\" she murmured faintly. \"You thought that I .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0?\nOh! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" she gasped in the infinity of her pain.\n\nBut like the wounded beast when first it sees its own hurt, so did this\nman now--gentle, artistic, fastidious though he was--suddenly feel every\ncruel instinct of the primitive savage rise within him at the thought of\nthe great wrong which he believed this woman had done him. All the\nlatent tenderness in his heart was crushed. Manlike, he only longed now\nto make her suffer one tithe of the agony which he had endured because\nof her treachery. He thought that she had played with him and fooled him\nin sheer wantonness, and he wished to crush her pride, her youth, her\ngaiety as she had broken his life and his honour.\n\nHe despised her for what she had done, and longed to let her see the\nfull measure of his contempt. Glad that he had succeeded in hurting her,\nhe tried to turn the blade within the wound.\n\n\"Nay, you need have no fear, lady,\" he said, \"the wars in France will\nsoon claim my presence, and the world will be quite ready to forgive to\nthe Duchess of Wessex the sins of Lady Ursula Glynde, especially after a\nchance French arrow had made her free again.\"\n\nBut it was the very magnitude of the insult which restored to Ursula her\nself-possession, nor would she let him see now how deeply she was\nwounded. With her self-control, her dignity also returned to her, and\nshe said with a coldness at least equal to his own--\n\n\"The world has naught to forgive me, as you know best, my lord.\"\n\n\"Nay! but I know that I must be grateful. By the mass! the story was\nwell concocted, and I must congratulate you, fair Bacchante!\" He laughed\nbitterly, ironically. \"Your honour threatened! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. my timely\ninterference! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and I who feared for the moment you might make full\nconfession.\"\n\n\"Confession of what? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. you are mad, my lord.\"\n\nShe had drawn nearer to him, and for the first time since the\ncommencement of this terrible tragedy of errors, one corner of that veil\nof impenetrable mystery was lifted from before her eyes. She did not\nmake even a remote guess at the truth as yet, but vaguely she became\naware that she and this man whom she loved were at some deadly\ncross-purposes, were playing at some horrible hide-and-seek, wherein\nthey were staking their life and happiness. There was something in his\nlook which suddenly revealed to that unerring feminine instinct in her\nthat his bitterness, his cruelty, his insults, had their rise in a heart\noverburdened with a hopeless passion. He, the most perfect gentleman,\nmost elegant courtier of his time, did not even try to curb his tongue,\nwhen speaking to her, who had never wronged him, and who had nobly saved\nhis life, when he must _know_ that she had done it out of disinterested\nself-sacrifice.\n\n_Did he know that?_\n\nThe question struck at her heart with sudden, overwhelming power. The\nlook of him, his whole attitude, told her in a vague, undefinable,\nununderstandable way that it was _herself_ whom he loved, that he\ndespised her for something she had not done, and yet that he spoke of\n_her_ when he sighed after an illusion.\n\n\"Confession of what? You are mad, my lord!\" she repeated wildly.\n\n\"Aye! mad!\" he said bitterly, \"mad when I feel the magic of your eyes\nstealing my honour away! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. mad, indeed! for with a fellow-creature's\nblood still warm upon that dainty hand, I long to fall on my knees and\ncover it with kisses.\"\n\nHis voice broke almost in a sob now that at last he had given utterance\nto that which had weighed on his soul all these days. He loathed her\ncrime, yet loved her more passionately than before. Oh! eternal mystery\nof the heart of man!\n\n\"Blood on my hands?\" she retorted violently. \"You are mad, my lord .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nmad, I say! A man's blood? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Did you not then kill Don Miguel to\nsave her whom you loved? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. did you not suffer disgrace, prepare for\ndeath, all because of her? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Did I not lie for you, give up mine\nhonour .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. mine all for you? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. Is it I who am mad, my lord, or\nyou?\"\n\n\"Nay! an you will have it so, fair one,\" he replied, trying to steady\nhis voice, which still was trembling, \"'tis I am mad! I'll believe\nanything, doubt everything, mine eyes, mine ears .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. the memory of you\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. as I saw you that night. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I'll try to remember only that I\nowe you my life .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. such as it is .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and let my senses be gladdened\nat the thought that you are beautiful.\"\n\nUrsula watched him with wild, burning eyes. Was the truth dawning at\nlast? She, as the woman, was bent on knowing what lay hidden beneath the\nexpression of this debasing passion. He, as the man, had fought a battle\nand lost; he loved her too madly, too completely to tear her out of his\nlife. His passion _had_ become base; he despised himself now more than\nhe had ever despised her, but he could no longer battle against that\noverpowering desire to fold her once more to his heart, to forgive and\nforget all save her beauty and the magic of her presence.\n\nBut she, though loving as ardently as he, wanted the truth above all.\nNever would she have accepted this degrading passion, which would have\nleft her for ever bruised and ashamed. She mustered up all her energy,\nall her presence of mind; it was her turn now to fight for happiness and\nfor honour.\n\nWho knows what destiny fate would have meted out to these two young\npeople if only she had been left a free hand? Would she have brought\nthem together or parted them finally and for ever? The fickle jade\nsmiled upon them for a moment or two, then allowed a stronger hand to\nlead her away into bondage.\n\nSo accurately had the Cardinal de Moreno calculated his chance of final\nsuccess that he himself was able to lead the Queen of England to the\nGreat Hall for the approaching ceremony, at the very moment when Wessex\nand Ursula were on the point of understanding one another.\n\nUrsula had just uttered an energetic and momentous--\n\n\"My lord! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nShe had stepped away from him and was looking him fearlessly in the\nface, resolved to question and cross-question until she understood\neverything, when the door was suddenly opened and Mary Tudor appeared,\nescorted by some of her ladies, and accompanied by His Eminence the\nSpanish envoy.\n\nIt was the stroke of a relentless sword across the Gordian knot which\nshe had sought to unravel. She had only just made up her mind to stake\nher all upon a final throw of the dice--an explanation with Wessex. He\nwas still completely deceived. She could see that what she already more\nthan guessed he had not even begun to suspect. The idea of a gigantic\nmisunderstanding had not yet entered his brain; she would have brought\nit before him, made him understand. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. And fate suddenly said, No!\n\nFate, or that cruel hand which pulled the strings that brought all\npuppets forward on this momentous stage? The Cardinal had darted a\nquick, anxious look on Wessex and then had smiled with satisfaction.\nUrsula caught both look and smile, and also that sudden hardening of the\nCardinal's clever face, and knew that her last chance had gone.\n\nWessex had seemed relieved when the Queen entered, and Ursula knew that\nnever again would she be allowed to see him alone, never again would she\nbe able to speak to him undisturbed.\n\n\"Nothing flies more quickly than an illusion when it is on the wing!\"\n\nNothing! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. save happiness .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. when it begins to slip slowly away,\nand tired hands are too weak to retain it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nA FORLORN HOPE\n\n\nThe Great Hall had quickly filled with ladies and gentlemen. Mary Tudor\nhad rapidly approached the dais, holding out one gracious hand to Wessex\nand vouchsafing but a cold, callous look to Ursula Glynde, who, like\nsome young, wounded fawn, seemed to be standing at bay, facing this\ncrowd of indifferent spectators who had literally come between her and\nher happiness.\n\nIt seemed as if Mary felt a cruel delight in bringing before the young\ngirl's notice the hopelessness of her position, the irreparability of\nthe breach which existed now between her and His Grace of Wessex.\n\nThe Queen's jealous eyes had already noted the cold salutation with\nwhich Wessex so readily left Ursula's side, in order to turn to the\nnew-comers. His Grace was evidently glad to see the end of a painful\ninterview, and Mary was too weak a woman not to rejoice at sight of the\nheartache which was expressed in Ursula's pallid face, and not to try to\nenhance the pain of the wound.\n\nTherefore when Wessex respectfully kissed her hand she kept him close\nbeside her, whispering tender words which she hoped her rival might\nhear.\n\n\"It seems like a beautiful dream, my lord,\" she said gently, \"to see you\nonce more at our Court. The ugly nightmare is over, and I am almost\nhappy.\"\n\n\"I humbly thank Your Majesty,\" replied the Duke. \"My whole life can\nhenceforth be spent in expressing my gratitude for a graciousness,\nwhich I so little deserve.\"\n\n\"Nay! I pray you to put us to the test, my dear lord. My heart aches\nwith the desire to grant your every whim.\"\n\n\"Then I beg of Your Majesty a command in France.\"\n\n\"You wish to leave me?\" said Mary with tender reproach.\n\n\"I hope to save Calais for Your Majesty's crown.\"\n\n\"Ah, my lord! I have more need of friends just now than cities! Whilst\nyou go to France your Queen will wed King Philip of Spain.\"\n\n\"I hope not, Your Majesty,\" he rejoined earnestly.\n\n\"The letter of acceptance for my royal master already bears Her\nMajesty's signature,\" here interposed the Cardinal blandly.\n\n\"Aye! I have pledged my royal word,\" added the Queen with a short sigh.\n\"His Eminence hath served us well and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nShe made an effort to steady her voice, and avoided meeting the anxious\nlook which Wessex had cast upon her.\n\n\"But we will not mar the happiness of this joyous day,\" she continued\nafter a while, speaking with enforced cheerfulness. \"My Lord High\nSteward here would desire our confirmation of the free pardon granted in\nhonour of it, to all who were awaiting trial.\"\n\n\"If Your Majesty will deign to append the royal signature,\" said Lord\nChandois, who was fingering a large document.\n\n\"With pleasure, my lord. Are there many awaiting trial?\"\n\nLord Chandois spread the document out on the table, and Mary Tudor\nprepared to sign it.\n\n\"A dozen or so, Your Majesty,\" explained the Lord High Steward; \"men\nand women accused of roguery, witchcraft, and vagabondage.\"\n\nWith a bold stroke of her pen Mary added her royal name to the\ndeclaration of a free pardon.\n\n\"Let them be set free,\" she said, while Lord Chandois once more took\npossession of the paper. \"It is our royal desire that these poor louts\nshould thank His Grace of Wessex for their liberty, which they owe to\nhim.\"\n\nOnce more she turned with her usual affectionate gentleness towards the\nDuke. Throughout this brief, seemingly indifferent scene, Ursula had\nstood by, like an image carved in stone.\n\nEtiquette forbade her retirement until the Queen granted her leave, and\nMary seemed desirous to keep her close at hand, as a contrast, perhaps,\nto the exuberant joy which prevailed among the other ladies and\ngentlemen there.\n\nIn the midst of all this merriment and gaiety, the hubbub of many\nvoices, the pleasant laughter and lively banter, two silent figures\nstood out in strange contrast. Ursula, rigid, ghostlike in her white\ndraperies, her young face expressive of hopeless despair and of deadly\nsorrow kept in check, lest indifferent eyes read its miserable tale; and\nWessex, moving like an automaton among his friends, answering at random,\ntrying with all his might to keep his thoughts from straying, his eyes\nfrom wandering, towards that beautiful statue, which now seemed like an\nexquisite carven monument of his own vanished happiness.\n\nNo one took much notice of Ursula Glynde, she was the disgraced\nmaid-of-honour, the fallen star, scarce worth beholding, and she was\nglad of this isolation, which the selfishness of her former friends\ncreated around her. She looked for the last time upon the pomp and\npageant of this glittering Court life; her very soul yearned for the\npeace and seclusion of austere convent walls. For the last time too she\nlooked upon the man on whom she had lavished all the tenderness of her\nromantic temperament, whom she had set up on a pedestal of chivalry from\nwhich she felt loath even now to dethrone him.\n\nShe could see that he suffered and that he did not understand. The\nmisunderstanding, which nothing could clear up now, still made a veil of\ndarkness before his eyes. Her tender heart ached for him, her soul went\nout to him amidst all these people who laughed and chatted around her.\nFor one brief moment their eyes met across a sea of indifferent\nfaces--his lighted up with all the ardour of a never-fading passionate\nlove, and hers spoke to him an eternal farewell.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\nPOOR MIRRAB\n\n\nA few moments later the whole gay and giddy throng, like a flight of\nbrilliantly hued butterflies, had fluttered out into the garden.\n\nThe wintry sun was bestowing its last cold kiss on the terraces and\nbosquets of the park. Beyond, the landscape--wrapped in a delicate haze\nof purple--was gently swooning in the arms of this November afternoon.\nAll bird-song was silent, save the harsh chirrup of aggressive sparrows\nand the occasional brisk note of an irrepressible robin.\n\nClose by the fountain a strange, dull group moved about somewhat\nlistlessly--men and women, a dozen or so, in faded or ragged worsted\nmantles, shoes through which the flesh appeared, and mud-stained,\nbedraggled hose. Truly a wondrous spectacle on the delicately gravelled\npaths of the regal residence! a remarkable picture against the majestic\nbackground of carefully trimmed hedges, or conventional, well-cared-for\nshrubberies.\n\nThey looked indifferently round them, these poor shreds of society--the\nhappy recipients of unlooked-for royal bounty. There were all sorts and\nconditions of men and women here, from the wrinkly-visaged hag who plied\na precarious trade in illicit goods, to the hardened, sullen lout who\nmade of Her Majesty's prisons an habitual home. A vagrant too here and\nthere--one boy, barely in his teens, with pinched, haggard features, on\nwhich starvation had already scribbled her ugly name; a young girl, with\nbold, dark eyes, and coarse face masked with glaring cosmetics; and, far\nin the remote background, a huddled-up figure of a woman in tawdry\nfinery, with a torn, bedraggled white dress ill concealing her naked\nshoulders, a few scraps of faded ivy-leaves still clinging to her\nbright-hued, matted hair.\n\nThey were astonished to find themselves here: made curious, senseless\njokes about the marble basin, the trimmed shrubs, the fish in the ponds.\nThe whole thing was a puzzle, and poverty and hunger had dulled all joy\nin them. They had been told that by the Queen's desire and at His Grace\nof Wessex' prayer, they were to be immune from punishment for their\npresent offences, and a vague, dull wonder as to the meaning of this\nunexpected clemency filled their benighted souls. They were at liberty,\ninasmuch as no man-at-arms actually dogged their footsteps, but they\nfelt the eyes of stern guardians, court lackeys, or park-keepers fixed\nunrelentingly upon them.\n\nSo they did not take special advantage of this so-called freedom, nor of\nthe permission to roam about at will in Her Majesty's own garden. They\nclung together in one compact group, feeling a certain strength in this\nunion of their common misery, and stared open-mouthed at what was\nnearest to them and required least effort of the brain to understand.\n\nWhen at a given moment they saw a number of rich lords and ladies emerge\nupon the distant terrace, they felt wholly terrified, and would have\nbeaten a quick and general retreat had not one of the royal servitors\nsuddenly called upon them severally to listen.\n\n\"His Grace the Duke of Wessex is coming to speak with ye!\" said this\ngorgeously apparelled personage, addressing the massed group of\nmiserable humanity. \"Stay ye all here, until His Grace arrives. Your\ngood behaviour may prove for your own good.\"\n\nAnd silently, dully, they obeyed. They ceased their aimless wanderings\nand concentrated their attention after a while upon a tall figure,\ndressed in rich black, which had detached itself from the brilliant\ngroups on the terrace and was walking rapidly towards them.\n\nSo that was His Grace the Duke of Wessex. A serious-minded gentleman,\nsurely, but lately accused of murder, and proved to be innocent. They\ncould not yet see his face, only his tall, robust figure moving swiftly\ntowards them. Strange that a noble duke, a rich and great lord, should\nwish to speak with them. The women, as if half ashamed of their ragged\nkirtles, had retreated behind the men. The latter had doffed their caps\nand were mechanically passing their thin fingers through their tangled\nhair.\n\nQuite in the rear the female figure in the bedraggled white gown cowered\nagainst the edge of the marble basin.\n\nThen gradually His Grace came nearer, the women ventured to peep at him\nover the shoulders of the men. His face looked kind, though very sad.\nThe poor people gathered up their courage to face him bravely since he\ncame all unattended amongst them. One or two of the younger lads\nventured as he approached to utter an humble--\n\n\"God save His Grace of Wessex!\"\n\n\"I thank you all,\" he said graciously. \"And now, my friends, I'd have\nyou believe that 'twas not idle curiosity which hath brought me here\nbeside you. But yesterday I stood like you, accused of offence against\nthe law of the land. I have known the sorrows and humiliations of a\npublic trial. By Her Majesty's grace you have escaped that trouble this\ntime, and I have it at heart that all of you who, like myself, have\npassed through prison doors should not again be tempted to break the\ndictates of your lawgivers. Hunger and sorrow are evil councillors.\nThough I know naught of the one I'd have you think sometimes of me as\none who has tasted of the bitter cup of sorrow, and thus thinking, I'd\nhave you pray to God for mercy on my soul and on that of one who is more\nsinful, more misguided than yourselves.\"\n\nIt was a strange little homily, thus delivered without any affectation\nby this high-born gentleman to his fellows in sorrow. They did not\nperhaps altogether understand him, but in his own quaint way he had\nappealed to a comradeship of misery, and the hearts of his hearers went\nout to him in a vague feeling of pity and reverence.\n\nThey had no need to call for \"largesse,\" for with his own hand he was\nalready distributing gold to those from whom he had asked prayers.\n\n\"God save Your Grace!\" muttered men and women, as one by one their rough\npalms closed over the munificent donations.\n\nThe ladies and gentlemen on the terrace had all watched this little\nscene from afar. After a while the curiosity of all these gay idlers was\nstill further aroused. Some of them wished to watch it a little more\nclosely, and began slowly strolling down the terrace steps, towards the\nquaint group made up of all these miserable vagrants surrounding the\nimposing, sable-clad figure of the Duke.\n\nThe Queen herself, attracted by the novelty of the spectacle, and her\nheart ever yearning for the near presence of the man she still loved so\ndearly, turned her steps towards the marble basin, with His Eminence the\nCardinal--ever a faithful attendant--by her side.\n\nWhen Mary Tudor, closely followed by some of her ladies and courtiers,\nthus reached the scene where the little drama was being enacted, they\nsaw His Grace standing somewhat irresolutely beside the huddled figure\nof a woman, whose tawdry drapings and matted, brilliant hair presented\na strange contrast to the dull greys and browns of the other people\naround her.\n\n\"Wilt thou not hold thy hand out to me, wench,\" His Grace was saying\nsomewhat impatiently. \"I would fain help thee, as it hath pleased Heaven\nI should help thy companions in misfortune.\"\n\nThe servitor who had stood close by all this while, lest the people\nprove too importunate or troublesome, now came up to the woman, and,\nless benevolently inclined than His Grace, he caught hold of her,\nsomewhat rudely, by the shoulder.\n\n\"Come, wench, wake up!\" he said roughly, \"think thou His Grace hath more\ntime to waste on thee? She seems somewhat daft, so please Your Grace,\"\nadded the man with a shrug of the shoulders, \"and hath not spoken since\nher arrest.\"\n\n\"Who is she?\"\n\n\"Some vagrant or worse, so please Your Grace. She was arrested a\nfortnight ago, and hath never been heard to utter one word.\"\n\n\"Wilt look up, wench?\" said Wessex gently.\n\n\"I dare not,\" murmured the woman under her breath.\n\n\"Dare not? Why? I'll not harm thee.\"\n\n\"'Tis I have wronged thee so.\"\n\nWessex laughed lightly. Clearly the poor wretch was demented, but he\nwould have liked to have put some money into her own hand, lest some\nunscrupulous person should rob her of his gift. Therefore he said as\nkindly as he could--\n\n\"I forgive thee gladly any wrong thou mayst have done me, and now wilt\nlook at me in token that thou'rt no more afraid?\"\n\nThere was silence for a few moments. The poor people, happy with the\nrich gifts in their hands, scared too by the presence of so many lords\nand ladies, among whom they, however, had not yet recognized the Queen,\nall retreated into the background, leaving Wessex and the strange woman\nalone and isolated from their own groups, his rich black doublet and\nfine mantle and plumes contrasting strangely against the dank,\nmud-bespattered white dress of the unfortunate vagrant.\n\nWhat a quaint picture did they present--these two, whose destinies had\nbeen so closely knit. No one spoke, for every one felt that curious,\nunexplainable awe which falls upon the spirit of every man and woman\nwhen in the presence of an unfathomable mystery. And that mystery, every\none felt it. The woman's voice had such a solemn ring in it when she\nsaid, \"'Tis I have wronged thee so.\"\n\nIn the very midst of this awed silence the woman suddenly threw back her\nhead, brushed the hair back from her face, and looked straight into the\neyes of the Duke.\n\nShe was wan and pale with hunger, smears of mud spoilt the beauty of her\nfeatures, but there was a look even now in that face which made Wessex\nrecoil with horror. He did not utter a word, but gazed on as if a\nghostly vision had suddenly appeared before him and was mocking him with\nits terrifying aspects.\n\nGrinning monsters seemed to surround that girlish figure before him,\npointing with claw-like fingers at the golden hair, the delicate\nstraight nose, the childish mouth. As in a hellish panorama he suddenly\nsaw the whole hideousness of the mistake which had wrecked his life's\nhappiness, and half dazed, helpless, he gazed on as upon the risen\nspectre of his past.\n\nA murmur close behind him broke the spell of this magic moment.\n\n\"So like the Lady Ursula,\" whispered one lady to her gallant.\n\nBut the name seemed to have reached the woman's dulled ears, and to have\nstruck upon a sensitive fibre of her intellect.\n\n\"Ursula again!\" she said vehemently, turning now to face the group of\nthe elegant ladies who stood staring at her. \"Why do you all plague me\nwith that name? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I am Mirrab, the soothsayer .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I've been taught\nto read the secrets of the stars, of the waters, the air, and the winds;\nI foretell the future and brew the elixir of life. Wessex saved my life!\n'tis his!--I read in the stars that he was in great danger and came to\nwarn him!\"\n\nHer apathy had totally deserted her now. She was gradually working\nherself up to a fever of excitement, talking more and more wildly, and\nletting her eyes roam restlessly on the brilliant groups before her--the\nladies, the courtiers .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. the Queen. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\n\nThen they alighted upon the Cardinal de Moreno, who, pale to the lips,\nstrove in vain to smother the growing agitation which had mastered him\nfrom the moment when he too first recognized Mirrab. Her passion at\nsight of him now turned to fury, and, pointing a vengeful finger at him,\nshe shouted wildly--\n\n\"'Twas he who tricked and fooled me .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. with smooth and lying tongue\nhe cajoled me! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. he and his friend .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. then they threatened to\nhave me whipped .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. if I did not depart in peace!\"\n\nAwed, horrified, every one listened. Mary Tudor herself hung upon the\ngirl's lips. The Cardinal made a final effort to preserve his outward\ncomposure.\n\n\"A madwoman!\" he murmured with a shrug of the shoulders. \"Your Majesty\nwould do well to retire; there's danger in the creature's eyes.\"\n\nBut Wessex was slowly coming to himself. His horror had vanished,\nleaving him calm before this terrible revelation. With the privilege\never accorded to him by the fond Queen, he now placed a firm hand upon\nher arm.\n\n\"In the name of Your Majesty's ever-present graciousness to me, I\nentreat you to listen to this woman,\" he said quietly. \"Meseems that\nsome dastardly trick hath been played upon us all.\"\n\nThe Cardinal tried to protest, but already Mary had acquiesced in\nWessex' wish, with a nod of the head.\n\n\"I have naught to refuse you, my dear lord,\" she said sadly.\n\nVaguely she too had begun to guess the appalling riddle which had\npuzzled her for so long, and though her heart dimly felt that she was\neven now losing for ever the man whom she so ardently loved, she was too\nfearless a Queen, too much of a proud Tudor, not to see justice done in\nthe face of so much treachery.\n\nThen Wessex once more turned to Mirrab.\n\n\"Tell me, girl,\" he said with utmost calm and gentleness, lest he should\nscare again her poor, wandering wits, \"tell me without any fear. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. I\nam the Duke of Wessex and I saved thy life .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. then thou hadst the\nwish to warn me of some danger .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and came to the Palace here .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nand my lord Cardinal tricked thee. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. How?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" she said piteously, turning appealing, dog-like eyes\nupon him. \"They dressed me up in fine clothes .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and then .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. then\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. when I saw thee .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and wished to speak with thee .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. he .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\nthe dark foreigner barred the way .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and I know not how it happened\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" she added, as a trembling suddenly seized her whole body, \"he\njeered at me .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and I killed him!\"\n\n\"'Twas thou, wench, who killed Don Miguel?\" ejaculated the Queen,\nhorrified. \"Oh! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\nBut Wessex only bent his head and murmured in the intensity of his\nmisery--\n\n\"Heaven above me! .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. that I should have been so blind!\"\n\n\"I killed him .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\" repeated Mirrab with strange persistence, \"I killed\nhim .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. he would not let me go to thee.\"\n\n\"A madwoman and a wanton,\" here protested the Cardinal with all the\nvigour at his command. \"Surely Your Majesty will not believe this\nmiserable creature's calumnies.\"\n\n\"No, my lord,\" replied Mary with quiet dignity, \"we'll believe nothing\nuntil we have heard what Lady Ursula Glynde has to say. Lady Alicia,\"\nshe added, turning to one of her maids-of-honour, \"I pray you find the\nLady Ursula. Tell her what has happened and bid her come to us.\"\n\nIn the meanwhile, however, Mirrab seemed to have become aware of the\nconsequences of her vehement confession. Her wandering wits came slowly\nback to her. Terrified, she looked from one to the other of the grave\nfaces which were fixed upon her.\n\n\"What will they do to me?\" she murmured, turning appealing eyes on the\none man whom she dared to trust.\n\n\"Nay, Mirrab, have no fear,\" said Wessex kindly, as he took her rough\nhands in his and tried to soothe her scared spirits with a gentle touch.\n\"Once by chance I saved thy life .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. but thou in return hast now\nrestored to me that which is far dearer than life itself. I am eternally\nthy debtor, Mirrab, and I pledge thee the honour of Wessex that no harm\nshall come to thee .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. for I myself will beg for thy pardon of Her\nMajesty on my knees.\"\n\n\"Nay, my lord,\" rejoined Mary Tudor earnestly, for he had turned to the\nQueen, prepared to proffer his request on his knees, \"meseems a grievous\nwrong has been done to you--if unwittingly--by your Queen and country.\nLet the wench be free to pray to the Holy Virgin for her great sin. I\nmyself will care for her, and she shall enter any convent she may\nchoose, and be honoured there as if she had brought with her the richest\ndowry in the land. But,\" she added, turning to Lord Chandois, \"I desire\nher to make full confession once more before you, my lord, in writing,\nand to swear to it and sign it with her name. You may go, wench,\" she\nsaid finally, turning to Mirrab, \"your Queen has pardoned you. May you\nbe happy in the peace of the convent. We will never forget you, and ever\nsee that joy shall always be in your life.\"\n\nSlowly, as the Queen spoke, Mirrab sank upon her knees. It seemed to the\npoor girl as if God's angels were whispering words of comfort in her\near. Two servitors now came close to her, ready to lead her back to the\nPalace, there to place her under the charge of waiting-women until her\nconfession had been duly written and sworn to.\n\nBut before she finally allowed herself to be led away she once more\nturned to Wessex.\n\n\"May I kiss thy hand?\" she murmured gently.\n\nHe gave her his hand, and she covered it with kisses, and then she\npassed out of his life, ever remembered by him, ever comforted, happy in\nthe peaceful and silent home which the Queen had so royally provided for\nher.\n\nBut this little interlude had roused the Cardinal's feverish impatience\nto boiling point. Already he had tortured his astute brain for some sort\nof issue out of this tangled web. He would not own a defeat so readily,\ncertainly not before he made a final struggle to reassert the dignity of\nhis position. He forced his face to express nothing but delicate irony,\nhis eyes not to betray the slightest hint of fear.\n\n\"Truly, this is somewhat curious justice,\" he said, as Mirrab's strange\nfigure disappeared behind a turn of the tall yew hedge, \"surely Your\nMajesty will not condemn unheard? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"No, my lord Cardinal, not unheard,\" retorted Mary Tudor haughtily. \"We\nhave seen strange things to-day, and can only guess at the terrible\ntangle which caused the first gentleman in England to take upon himself\nthe burden of a heinous crime.\"\n\n\"And no doubt,\" added Wessex, \"that His Eminence can solve the riddle of\nhow a pure and noble girl was led into sacrificing her honour.\"\n\n\"Nay!\" retorted the Cardinal bitingly, \"His Grace of Wessex is more\ncompetent than I to solve the riddle of a woman's heart. The Lady Ursula\nhas confessed; this trick of trying to disprove her tale,\" he added with\ncutting sarcasm, \"was well thought on by the most chivalrous gentleman\nin England. .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. An it satisfies His Grace,\" he continued with a\ncareless shrug of the shoulders, \"surely I could never wish to dispel so\npleasant an illusion.\"\n\nPerhaps the Duke would have retorted in angry words, despite the\nunutterable contempt which he felt for this final poisoned shaft aimed\nat him by the Cardinal; but just then the groups which surrounded him,\nthe Queen and His Eminence, parted, and Ursula Glynde stood before them\nall.\n\nShe still wore the white robes which became her so well, but now they\nonly helped to enhance the brilliancy of her hair, the clear blue of her\neyes, and a certain rosy flush, which lent to her delicate face a\ndelicious air of childishness and innocence. She looked at no one,\nthough her eyes were actually fixed respectfully on the Queen, but her\nspirit seemed to have wandered off into a land of dreams.\n\n\"Your Majesty sent for me?\" she said.\n\n\"Lady Alicia has told you?\" rejoined the Queen.\n\nUrsula closed her glorious eyes. A ray of intense joy seemed to illumine\nher whole face, lighting it with a radiance which surely had its origin\nin heaven. Then she slowly turned her head towards Wessex, and in one\nlittle word told him all that her soul contained.\n\n\"Everything!\" she said.\n\nEverything! that is to say, his sin, his mistrust of her, his great\npassionate love, and self-sacrifice for her. Everything! which meant her\nown love, her own devotion, her joy to find him true and chivalrous, her\nhappiness and her hope.\n\nMary Tudor saw the look and its response from Wessex' eyes. She saw the\nend of the one dream which had filled her dull, rigid life and rendered\nit hopeful and bright. But she was above all a Tudor. She accepted the\ndictate of Fate, she bent the neck to a greater will than her own, and\nclosed the book of her illusions, never to peruse its pages again. One\nlast look at the man who had had the one passion of which her strange\nhard heart was capable, one short farewell to the vague hope, which\nuntil now would not be gainsaid.\n\nFrom now and to the end of her days she would be Queen alone--the woman\nlay buried amongst the autumn leaves which strewed the walks of old\nHampton Court Palace.\n\nAs Queen now she once more turned to Ursula. Justice in her demanded\nthat every wrong should be righted, every misdoer punished.\n\n\"Child,\" she said quietly, \"it was not you then who was with Don\nMiguel?\"\n\n\"No, Your Majesty,\" replied Ursula, returning to earth at sound of the\nQueen's kindly voice, \"Lady Alicia tells me that a girl .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. a poor,\nsad girl, was in face so like to me .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. that His Grace must have been\nmistaken .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"But, child .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. then why have told a lie? .\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0.\"\n\n\"His Eminence told me what to say before the Court, and promised His\nGrace would be saved by it.\"\n\nHer voice dropped to so low a murmur that no one heard it but the Queen\n.\u00c2\u00a0.\u00c2\u00a0. and Wessex.\n\n\"I did it to save him!\"\n\n\"A lie, Your Majesty,\" protested the Cardinal.\n\n\"The truth!\" protested Ursula loudly. \"I pray Your Majesty to look on me\nand him and see on whose face is writ the word--fear.\"\n\nAlmost as if in obedience to Ursula's words Mary Tudor turned and faced\nthe Spanish Cardinal. He tried to meet her look boldly. Even in defeat\nthere was a certain grandeur in this man.\n\nHe had staked and lost his own position, his future career, his hopes of\na greater destiny, but he had succeeded in his schemes. He knew Mary\nTudor well enough to rejoice in this--that she would never now break her\nword to Philip, even though she let the flood of her royal wrath fall\nfull heavily upon him.\n\n\"Go back, my lord, to your royal master,\" said Queen Mary with lofty\ncontempt. \"My word is my bond, and my pledge to him is sacred; but tell\nhim, an he wishes to win the heart of the Queen of England, he must send\nan honest man to woo her.\"\n\nThen without another glance at him, without looking to see if he\nfollowed her or not, she beckoned to her ladies and gentlemen, her\nattendants and her courtiers, and, without once turning her royal head\ntowards the spot where had died her happiness, she walked firmly in the\ndirection of her Palace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\nTHE END\n\n\nAnd now every one had gone.\n\nThe wintry sun was already sinking towards the west, faint purple\nshadows wrapped the alleys and bosquets of the park in dim and ghostly\narms.\n\nThe last call of a belated robin broke the silence of the gathering\ndusk, then it too was silenced, and only the \"hush--sh--sh--sh\" of\nfallen leaves on the gravelled path murmured a soft accompaniment to the\nmusic of the night.\n\nA man and a woman were alone beside the marble basin, face to face, eye\nto eye, yet finding not one word to say. Both had so much to atone for,\nso much to forgive, that mere words were but the poor expression of all\nthat filled their hearts.\n\nThe moments sped on--a few brief seconds or an eternity, who can say\nwhich?\n\nThe shadows merged one in the other. Far away the river murmured gently.\n\nNow Wessex had sunk on his knees, and she bent down to him.\n\nAll the birds had gone to rest; one by one, pale winter stars peeped\ndown upon the gorgeous Palace, the majestic pile which had seen so many\nglories, hidden so many miseries, one by one they peeped down on the\nsilent park, the mysterious river, the ghostly outlines of walls and\ncupolas.\n\nBut beside the marble basin two human hearts had found one another, soul\nhad gone out to soul at last, and Ursula lay once more in the arms of\nher future lord.\n\n\n\n\nPLYMOUTH\n\nW BRENDON AND SON, LTD., PRINTERS\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note: The majority of the text of this novel is taken from\n_The Tangled Skein_, the British edition.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":960,"split":"train"}
