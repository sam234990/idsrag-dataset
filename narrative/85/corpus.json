He tells the story of a student named Bernard Langdon, who has to take some time away from his studies to earn money as a teacher. Langdon spends a short time teaching at a school in the village of Pigwacket Centre where he earns respect after taking on the school bully, Abner Briggs. After only a month, however, Langdon leaves to work at the Apollinean Female Institute in the town of Rockland. The owner of the institute is the profit-focused Silas Peckham and the schoolmistress is Miss Helen Darley, who is literally working herself to death. One of his students is the 17-year-old Elsie Venner, who purposely sits apart from the other students. She is known for being strange and quick to anger. She is only close to her father Dudley Venner, who she calls by his first name, and her governess, Old Sophy. She also has a friendship with the town physician Dr. Kittredge, to whom she reveals that she ran away from home to hide on the other side of the mountain, where the other town residents are afraid to go.\nElsie's half-Spanish cousin Richard \"Dick\" Venner pays a visit at the Venner estate. Like Elsie, his mother died when he was a child and the two cousins were playmates in their childhood. Elsie, however, was rough on her cousin and once bit him hard enough that he still has scars from it. Dick has since become a skilled horse-rider and a bit of a trouble-maker, though stories of his escapades are unclear. Rumors abound that Dick has come to town to ask his cousin Elsie to marry him; in fact, he intends to marry her so that he can inherit his uncle's estate.\nLangdon is surprised to find a gift stuck in the pages of a book by Virgil on his desk at school. Pressed inside is an exotic-looking flower, known to be the type Elsie collects. Frightened yet intrigued that the girl has taken an interest in him, he resolves to climb the mountain and find her secret hiding-place. Climbing up several precipitous rock formations, Langdon finds the source of the exotic flower Elsie presented him. Investigating a cavern where he thinks Elsie hides out, Langdon is instead overtaken by a rattlesnake poised to strike. Just at that moment, however, Elsie appears and calms the snake merely by looking at it.\nIntrigued, Langdon researches snakes, poisons, and the \"evil eye\". He cages a couple snakes and contacts his old professor for information. Doctor Kittredge recognizes the mutual interest between Langdon and Elsie, and recommends the former begin practicing with a pistol. In the meantime, Dick Venner subtly pursues a relationship with Elsie in order to become heir to the ample Venner estate but is jealous of Langdon and worries Elsie's father might marry Miss Darley. One night, Dick attacks Langdon with his lasso. Langdon shoots his pistol and kills Dick's horse but is injured. Dr. Kittredge's assistant appears, having been ordered to follow Dick and, after exposing the incident, Dick is run out of town.\nSoon, Elsie admits her interest in Langdon. Though he admits he is concerned about her as a friend, she is devastated and becomes sick. During her illness, she calls for Miss Darley to attend to her. Miss Darley finally asks Old Sophy how Elsie's mother died, and it is implied that she was poisoned by a snake bite shortly before Elsie was born. Elsie slowly loses her mysterious nature and softens enough to tell her father she loves him. She dies shortly after.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Elsie Venner, by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.\n\n[The Physician and Poet, Not the Jurist, O. W.

The critic who is curious\nin coincidences must refer to the Magazine for the date of publication\nof the chapter he is examining.\n\nIn calling this narrative a \u00e2\u0080\u009cromance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Author wishes to make sure of\nbeing indulged in the common privileges of the poetic license. Through\nall the disguise of fiction a grave scientific doctrine may be detected\nlying beneath some of the delineations of character. He has used this\ndoctrine as a part of the machinery of his story without pledging his\nabsolute belief in it to the extent to which it is asserted or implied.\nIt was adopted as a convenient medium of truth rather than as an\naccepted scientific conclusion. The reader must judge for himself what\nis the value of various stories cited from old authors. He must decide\nhow much of what has been told he can accept either as having actually\nhappened, or as possible and more or less probable. The Author must\nbe permitted, however, to say here, in his personal character, and as\nresponsible to the students of the human mind and body, that since\nthis story has been in progress he has received the most startling\nconfirmation of the possibility of the existence of a character like\nthat which he had drawn as a purely imaginary conception in Elsie\nVenner.\n\nBOSTON, January, 1861.\n\n\n\n\nA SECOND PREFACE.\n\nThis is the story which a dear old lady, my very good friend, spoke of\nas \u00e2\u0080\u009ca medicated novel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and quite properly refused to read. I was always\npleased with her discriminating criticism. It is a medicated novel, and\nif she wished to read for mere amusement and helpful recreation there\nwas no need of troubling herself with a story written with a different\nend in view.\n\nThis story has called forth so many curious inquiries that it seems\nworth while to answer the more important questions which have occurred\nto its readers.\n\nIn the first place, it is not based on any well-ascertained\nphysiological fact. There are old fables about patients who have barked\nlike dogs or crowed like cocks, after being bitten or wounded by those\nanimals. There is nothing impossible in the idea that Romulus and Remus\nmay have imbibed wolfish traits of character from the wet nurse the\nlegend assigned them, but the legend is not sound history, and the\nsupposition is nothing more than a speculative fancy. Still, there is a\nlimbo of curious evidence bearing on the subject of pre-natal influences\nsufficient to form the starting-point of an imaginative composition.\n\nThe real aim, of the story was to test the doctrine of \u00e2\u0080\u009coriginal sin\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n and human responsibility for the disordered volition coming under that\ntechnical denomination. Was Elsie Venner, poisoned by the venom of a\ncrotalus before she was born, morally responsible for the \u00e2\u0080\u009cvolitional\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n aberrations, which translated into acts become what is known as sin,\nand, it may be, what is punished as crime? If, on presentation of the\nevidence, she becomes by the verdict of the human conscience a proper\nobject of divine pity and not of divine wrath, as a subject of moral\npoisoning, wherein lies the difference between her position at the bar\nof judgment, human or divine, and that of the unfortunate victim who\nreceived a moral poison from a remote ancestor before he drew his first\nbreath?\n\nIt might be supposed that the character of Elsie Veneer was suggested\nby some of the fabulous personages of classical or mediaeval story. I\nremember that a French critic spoke of her as cette pauvre Melusine. I\nought to have been ashamed, perhaps, but I had, not the slightest idea\nwho Melusina was until I hunted up the story, and found that she was a\nfairy, who for some offence was changed every Saturday to a serpent from\nher waist downward. I was of course familiar with Keats's Lamia, another\nimaginary being, the subject of magical transformation into a serpent.\nMy story was well advanced before Hawthorne's wonderful \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarble Faun,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n which might be thought to have furnished me with the hint of a mixed\nnature,--human, with an alien element,--was published or known to me. So\nthat my poor heroine found her origin, not in fable or romance, but in a\nphysiological conception fertilized by a theological dogma.\n\nI had the dissatisfaction of enjoying from a quiet corner a well-meant\neffort to dramatize \u00e2\u0080\u009cElsie Veneer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Unfortunately, a physiological\nromance, as I knew beforehand, is hardly adapted for the melodramatic\nefforts of stage representation. I can therefore say, with perfect\ntruth, that I was not disappointed. It is to the mind, and not to the\nsenses, that such a story must appeal, and all attempts to render the\ncharacter and events objective on the stage, or to make them real by\nartistic illustrations, are almost of necessity failures. The story has\nwon the attention and enjoyed the favor of a limited class of readers,\nand if it still continues to interest others of the same tastes and\nhabits of thought I can ask nothing more of it.\n\nJanuary 23, 1883.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE TO THE NEW EDITION.\n\nI have nothing of importance to add to the two preceding Prefaces. The\ncontinued call for this story, which was not written for popularity, but\nwith a very serious purpose, has somewhat surprised and, I need not add,\ngratified me. I can only restate the motive idea of the tale in a little\ndifferent language. Believing, as I do, that our prevailing theologies\nare founded upon an utterly false view of the relation of man to his\nCreator, I attempted to illustrate the doctrine of inherited moral\nresponsibility for other people's misbehavior. I tried to make out a\ncase for my poor Elsie, whom the most hardened theologian would find\nit hard to blame for her inherited ophidian tastes and tendencies. How,\nthen, is he to blame mankind for inheriting \u00e2\u0080\u009csinfulness\u00e2\u0080\u009d from their\nfirst parents? May not the serpent have bitten Eve before the birth\nof Cain, her first-born? That would have made an excuse for Cain's\nchildren, as Elsie's ante-natal misfortune made an excuse for her. But\nwhat difference does it make in the child's responsibility whether his\ninherited tendencies come from a snake-bite or some other source which\nhe knew nothing about and could not have prevented from acting? All this\nis plain enough, and the only use of the story is to bring the dogma of\ninherited guilt and its consequences into a clearer point of view.\n\nBut, after all, the tale must have proved readable as a story to account\nfor the large number of editions which it has reached.\n\nSome readers have been curious about the locality the writer was\nthought to have in view. No particular place was intended. Some of the\ncharacters may have been thought to have been drawn from life; but the\npersonages mentioned are mostly composites, like Mr. Galton's compound\nphotographic likenesses, and are not calculated to provoke scandal or\nsuits for libel.\n\nO. W. H.\n\nBEVERLY FARMS, MASS., August 3, 1891.\n\n\n\n\nELSIE VENNER.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. THE BRAHMIN CASTE OF NEW ENGLAND.\n\nThere is nothing in New England corresponding at all to the feudal\naristocracies of the Old World. Whether it be owing to the stock from\nwhich we were derived, or to the practical working of our institutions,\nor to the abrogation of the technical \u00e2\u0080\u009claw of honor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which draws a\nsharp line between the personally responsible class of \u00e2\u0080\u009cgentlemen\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\nthe unnamed multitude of those who are not expected to risk their lives\nfor an abstraction,--whatever be the cause, we have no such aristocracy\nhere as that which grew up out of the military systems of the Middle\nAges.\n\nWhat we mean by \u00e2\u0080\u009caristocracy\u00e2\u0080\u009d is merely the richer part of the\ncommunity, that live in the tallest houses, drive real carriages, (not\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ckerridges,\u00e2\u0080\u009d) kidglove their hands, and French-bonnet their ladies'\nheads, give parties where the persons who call them by the above title\nare not invited, and have a provokingly easy way of dressing, walking,\ntalking, and nodding to people, as if they felt entirely at home, and\nwould not be embarrassed in the least, if they met the Governor, or even\nthe President of the United States, face to face. Some of these great\nfolks are really well-bred, some of them are only purse-proud and\nassuming,--but they form a class, and are named as above in the common\nspeech.\n\nIt is in the nature of large fortunes to diminish rapidly, when\nsubdivided and distributed. A million is the unit of wealth, now and\nhere in America. It splits into four handsome properties; each of these\ninto four good inheritances; these, again, into scanty competences for\nfour ancient maidens,--with whom it is best the family should die out,\nunless it can begin again as its great-grandfather did. Now a million\nis a kind of golden cheese, which represents in a compendious form the\nsummer's growth of a fat meadow of craft or commerce; and as this kind\nof meadow rarely bears more than one crop, it is pretty certain that\nsons and grandsons will not get another golden cheese out of it,\nwhether they milk the same cows or turn in new ones. In other words,\nthe millionocracy, considered in a large way, is not at all an affair\nof persons and families, but a perpetual fact of money with a variable\nhuman element, which a philosopher might leave out of consideration\nwithout falling into serious error. Of course, this trivial and,\nfugitive fact of personal wealth does not create a permanent\nclass, unless some special means are taken to arrest the process of\ndisintegration in the third generation. This is so rarely done, at least\nsuccessfully, that one need not live a very long life to see most of\nthe rich families he knew in childhood more or less reduced, and the\nmillions shifted into the hands of the country-boys who were sweeping\nstores and carrying parcels when the now decayed gentry were driving\ntheir chariots, eating their venison over silver chafing-dishes,\ndrinking Madeira chilled in embossed coolers, wearing their hair in\npowder, and casing their legs in long boots with silken tassels.\n\nThere is, however, in New England, an aristocracy, if you choose to call\nit so, which has a far greater character of permanence. It has grown\nto be a caste,--not in any odious sense;--but, by the repetition of the\nsame influences, generation after generation, it has acquired a distinct\norganization and physiognomy, which not to recognize is mere stupidity,\nand not to be willing to describe would show a distrust of the\ngood-nature and intelligence of our readers, who like to have us see all\nwe can and tell all we see.\n\nIf you will look carefully at any class of students in one of our\ncolleges, you will have no difficulty in selecting specimens of two\ndifferent aspects of youthful manhood. Of course I shall choose extreme\ncases to illustrate the contrast between them. In the first, the figure\nis perhaps robust, but often otherwise,--inelegant, partly from careless\nattitudes, partly from ill-dressing,--the face is uncouth in feature, or\nat least common,--the mouth coarse and unformed,--the eye unsympathetic,\neven if bright,--the movements of the face are clumsy, like those of\nthe limbs,--the voice is unmusical,--and the enunciation as if the words\nwere coarse castings, instead of fine carvings. The youth of the\nother aspect is commonly slender, his face is smooth, and apt to be\npallid,--his features are regular and of a certain delicacy,--his eye\nis bright and quick,--his lips play over the thought he utters as a\npianist's fingers dance over their music, and his whole air, though\nit may be timid, and even awkward, has nothing clownish. If you are\na teacher, you know what to expect from each of these young men. With\nequal willingness, the first will be slow at learning; the second will\ntake to his books as a pointer or a setter to his field-work.\n\nThe first youth is the common country-boy, whose race has been bred to\nbodily labor. Nature has adapted the family organization to the kind of\nlife it has lived. The hands and feet by constant use have got more than\ntheir share of development,--the organs of thought and expression less\nthan their share. The finer instincts are latent and must be developed.\nA youth of this kind is raw material in its first stage of elaboration.\nYou must not expect too much of any such. Many of them have force of\nwill and character, and become distinguished in practical life; but\nvery few of them ever become great scholars. A scholar is, in a large\nproportion of cases, the son of scholars or scholarly persons.\n\nThat is exactly what the other young man is. He comes of the Brahmin\ncaste of New England. This is the harmless, inoffensive, untitled\naristocracy referred to, and which many readers will at once\nacknowledge. There are races of scholars among us, in which aptitude for\nlearning, and all these marks of it I have spoken of, are congenital and\nhereditary. Their names are always on some college catalogue or other.\nThey break out every generation or two in some learned labor which calls\nthem up after they seem to have died out. At last some newer name takes\ntheir place, it maybe,--but you inquire a little and you find it is the\nblood of the Edwardses or the Chauncys or the Ellerys or some of the\nold historic scholars, disguised under the altered name of a female\ndescendant.\n\nThere probably is not an experienced instructor anywhere in our\nNorthern States who will not recognize at once the truth of this general\ndistinction. But the reader who has never been a teacher will very\nprobably object, that some of our most illustrious public men have come\ndirect from the homespun-clad class of the people,--and he may, perhaps,\neven find a noted scholar or two whose parents were masters of the\nEnglish alphabet, but of no other.\n\nIt is not fair to pit a few chosen families against the great multitude\nof those who are continually working their way up into the intellectual\nclasses. The results which are habitually reached by hereditary training\nare occasionally brought about without it. There are natural filters as\nwell as artificial ones; and though the great rivers are commonly more\nor less turbid, if you will look long enough, you may find a spring that\nsparkles as no water does which drips through your apparatus of\nsands and sponges. So there are families which refine themselves\ninto intellectual aptitude without having had much opportunity for\nintellectual acquirements. A series of felicitous crosses develops an\nimproved strain of blood, and reaches its maximum perfection at last in\nthe large uncombed youth who goes to college and startles the hereditary\nclass-leaders by striding past them all. That is Nature's republicanism;\nthank God for it, but do not let it make you illogical. The race of the\nhereditary scholar has exchanged a certain portion of its animal vigor\nfor its new instincts, and it is hard to lead men without a good deal\nof animal vigor. The scholar who comes by Nature's special grace from an\nunworn stock of broad-chested sires and deep-bosomed mothers must always\novermatch an equal intelligence with a compromised and lowered vitality.\nA man's breathing and digestive apparatus (one is tempted to add\nmuscular) are just as important to him on the floor of the Senate as his\nthinking organs. You broke down in your great speech, did you? Yes, your\ngrandfather had an attack of dyspepsia in '82, after working too hard on\nhis famous Election Sermon. All this does not touch the main fact: our\nscholars come chiefly from a privileged order, just as our best fruits\ncome from well-known grafts, though now and then a seedling apple, like\nthe Northern Spy, or a seedling pear, like the Seckel, springs from a\nnameless ancestry and grows to be the pride of all the gardens in the\nland.\n\nLet me introduce you to a young man who belongs to the Brahmin caste of\nNew England.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. THE STUDENT AND HIS CERTIFICATE.\n\nBernard C. Langdon, a young man attending Medical Lectures at the school\nconnected with one of our principal colleges, remained after the Lecture\none day and wished to speak with the Professor. He was a student of\nmark,--first favorite of his year, as they say of the Derby colts.\nThere are in every class half a dozen bright faces to which the teacher\nnaturally, directs his discourse, and by the intermediation of whose\nattention he seems to hold that of the mass of listeners. Among these\nsome one is pretty sure to take the lead, by virtue of a personal\nmagnetism, or some peculiarity of expression, which places the face in\nquick sympathetic relations with the lecturer. This was a young man\nwith such a face; and I found,--for you have guessed that I was the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cProfessor\u00e2\u0080\u009d above-mentioned,--that, when there was anything difficult to\nbe explained, or when I was bringing out some favorite illustration of a\nnice point, (as, for instance; when I compared the cell-growth, by which\nNature builds up a plant or an animal, to the glassblower's similar mode\nof beginning,--always with a hollow sphere, or vesicle, whatever he is\ngoing to make,) I naturally looked in his face and gauged my success by\nits expression.\n\nIt was a handsome face,--a little too pale, perhaps, and would have\nborne something more of fulness without becoming heavy. I put the\norganization to which it belongs in Section B of Class 1 of my\nAnglo-American Anthropology (unpublished). The jaw in this section is\nbut slightly narrowed,--just enough to make the width of the forehead\ntell more decidedly. The moustache often grows vigorously, but the\nwhiskers are thin. The skin is like that of Jacob, rather than like\nEsau's. One string of the animal nature has been taken away, but this\ngives only a greater predominance to the intellectual chords. To see\njust how the vital energy has been toned down, you must contrast one of\nthis section with a specimen of Section A of the same class,--say, for\ninstance, one of the old-fashioned, full-whiskered, red-faced, roaring,\nbig Commodores of the last generation, whom you remember, at least by\ntheir portraits, in ruffled shirts, looking as hearty as butchers and as\nplucky as bull-terriers, with their hair combed straight up from their\nforeheads, which were not commonly very high or broad. The special form\nof physical life I have been describing gives you a right to expect more\ndelicate perceptions and a more reflective, nature than you commonly\nfind in shaggy-throated men, clad in heavy suits of muscles.\n\nThe student lingered in the lecture-room, looking all the time as if he\nwanted to say something in private, and waiting for two or three others,\nwho were still hanging about, to be gone.\n\nSomething is wrong!--I said to myself, when I noticed his\nexpression.--Well, Mr. Langdon,--I said to him, when we were alone,--can\nI do anything for you to-day?\n\nYou can, Sir,--he said.--I am going to leave the class, for the present,\nand keep school.\n\nWhy, that 's a pity, and you so near graduating! You'd better stay and\nfinish this course and take your degree in the spring, rather than break\nup your whole plan of study.\n\nI can't help myself, Sir,--the young man answered.--There 's trouble at\nhome, and they cannot keep me here as they have done. So I must look out\nfor myself for a while. It's what I've done before, and am ready to\ndo again. I came to ask you for a certificate of my fitness to teach a\ncommon school, or a high school, if you think I am up to that. Are you\nwilling to give it to me?\n\nWilling? Yes, to be sure,--but I don't want you to go. Stay; we'll make\nit easy for you. There's a fund will do something for you, perhaps. Then\nyou can take both the annual prizes, if you like,--and claim them in\nmoney, if you want that more than medals.\n\nI have thought it all over,--he answered,--and have pretty much made up\nmy mind to go.\n\nA perfectly gentlemanly young man, of courteous address and mild\nutterance, but means at least as much as he says. There are some people\nwhose rhetoric consists of a slight habitual under-statement. I often\ntell Mrs. Professor that one of her \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it's sos\u00e2\u0080\u009d is worth the\nBible-oath of all the rest of the household that they \u00e2\u0080\u009cknow it's so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n When you find a person a little better than his word, a little more\nliberal than his promise, a little more than borne out in his statement\nby his facts, a little larger in deed than in speech, you recognize a\nkind of eloquence in that person's utterance not laid down in Blair or\nCampbell.\n\nThis was a proud fellow, self-trusting, sensitive, with\nfamily-recollections that made him unwilling to accept the kind of aid\nwhich many students would have thankfully welcomed. I knew him too well\nto urge him, after the few words which implied that he was determined\nto go. Besides, I have great confidence in young men who believe in\nthemselves, and are accustomed to rely on their own resources from an\nearly period. When a resolute young fellow steps up to the great bully,\nthe World, and takes him boldly by the beard, he is often surprised to\nfind it come off in his hand, and that it was only tied on to scare away\ntimid adventurers. I have seen young men more than once, who came to a\ngreat city without a single friend, support themselves and pay for their\neducation, lay up money in a few years, grow rich enough to travel, and\nestablish themselves in life, without ever asking a dollar of any person\nwhich they had not earned. But these are exceptional cases. There are\nhorse-tamers, born so,--as we all know; there are woman-tamers, who\nbewitch the sex as the pied piper bedeviled the children of Hamelin; and\nthere are world-tamers, who can make any community, even a Yankee one,\nget down and let them jump on its back as easily as Mr. Rarey saddled\nCruiser.\n\nWhether Langdon was of this sort or not I could not say positively; but\nhe had spirit, and, as I have said, a family-pride which would not let\nhim be dependent. The New England Brahmin caste often gets blended with\nconnections of political influence or commercial distinction. It is a\ncharming thing for the scholar, when his fortune carries him in this way\ninto some of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cold families\u00e2\u0080\u009d who have fine old houses, and city-lots\nthat have risen in the market, and names written in all the stock-books\nof all the dividend-paying companies. His narrow study expands into a\nstately library, his books are counted by thousands instead of hundreds,\nand his favorites are dressed in gilded calf in place of plebeian\nsheepskin or its pauper substitutes of cloth and paper.\n\nThe Reverend Jedediah Langdon, grandfather of our young gentleman, had\nmade an advantageous alliance of this kind. Miss Dorothea Wentworth had\nread one of his sermons which had been printed \u00e2\u0080\u009cby request,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and became\ndeeply interested in the young author, whom she had never seen. Out of\nthis circumstance grew a correspondence, an interview, a declaration, a\nmatrimonial alliance, and a family of half a dozen children. Wentworth\nLangdon, Esquire, was the oldest of these, and lived in the old\nfamily-mansion. Unfortunately, that principle of the diminution of\nestates by division, to which I have referred, rendered it somewhat\ndifficult to maintain the establishment upon the fractional income\nwhich the proprietor received from his share of the property. Wentworth\nLangdon, Esq., represented a certain intermediate condition of life\nnot at all infrequent in our old families. He was the connecting link\nbetween the generation which lived in ease, and even a kind of state,\nupon its own resources, and the new brood, which must live mainly by its\nwits or industry, and make itself rich, or shabbily subside into that\nlower stratum known to social geologists by a deposit of Kidderminster\ncarpets and the peculiar aspect of the fossils constituting the family\nfurniture and wardrobe. This slack-water period of a race, which comes\nbefore the rapid ebb of its prosperity, is familiar to all who live in\ncities. There are no more quiet, inoffensive people than these children\nof rich families, just above the necessity of active employment, yet\nnot in a condition to place their own children advantageously, if they\nhappen to have families. Many of them are content to live unmarried.\nSome mend their broken fortunes by prudent alliances, and some leave a\nnumerous progeny to pass into the obscurity from which their ancestors\nemerged; so that you may see on handcarts and cobblers' stalls names\nwhich, a few generations back, were upon parchments with broad seals,\nand tombstones with armorial bearings.\n\nIn a large city, this class of citizens is familiar to us in the\nstreets. They are very courteous in their salutations; they have time\nenough to bow and take their hats off,--which, of course, no businessman\ncan afford to do. Their beavers are smoothly brushed, and their\nboots well polished; all their appointments are tidy; they look\nthe respectable walking gentleman to perfection. They are prone to\nhabits,--they frequent reading-rooms,--insurance-offices,--they walk the\nsame streets at the same hours,--so that one becomes familiar with their\nfaces and persons, as a part of the street-furniture.\n\nThere is one curious circumstance, that all city-people must have\nnoticed, which is often illustrated in our experience of the slack-water\ngentry. We shall know a certain person by his looks, familiarly, for\nyears, but never have learned his name. About this person we shall have\naccumulated no little circumstantial knowledge;--thus, his face, figure,\ngait, his mode of dressing, of saluting, perhaps even of speaking, may\nbe familiar to us; yet who he is we know not. In another department of\nour consciousness, there is a very familiar name, which we have never\nfound the person to match. We have heard it so often, that it has\nidealized itself, and become one of that multitude of permanent shapes\nwhich walk the chambers of the brain in velvet slippers in the company\nof Falstaff and Hamlet and General Washington and Mr. Pickwick.\nSometimes the person dies, but the name lives on indefinitely. But now\nand then it happens, perhaps after years of this independent existence\nof the name and its shadowy image in the brain, on the one part, and the\nperson and all its real attributes, as we see them daily, on the other,\nthat some accident reveals their relation, and we find the name we have\ncarried so long in our memory belongs to the person we have known so\nlong as a fellow-citizen. Now the slack--water gentry are among the\npersons most likely to be the subjects of this curious divorce of title\nand reality,--for the reason, that, playing no important part in the\ncommunity, there is nothing to tie the floating name to the actual\nindividual, as is the case with the men who belong in any way to the\npublic, while yet their names have a certain historical currency, and we\ncannot help meeting them, either in their haunts, or going to and from\nthem.\n\nTo this class belonged Wentworth Langdon, Esq. He had been \u00e2\u0080\u009cdead-headed\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n into the world some fifty years ago, and had sat with his hands in\nhis pockets staring at the show ever since. I shall not tell you, for\nreasons before hinted, the whole name of the place in which he lived.\nI will only point you in the right direction, by saying that there are\nthree towns lying in a line with each other, as you go \u00e2\u0080\u009cdown East,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n each of them with a Port in its name, and each of them having a peculiar\ninterest which gives it individuality, in addition to the Oriental\ncharacter they have in common. I need not tell you that these towns are\nNewburyport, Portsmouth, and Portland. The Oriental character they have\nin common consists in their large, square, palatial mansions, with sunny\ngardens round them. The two first have seen better days. They are in\nperfect harmony with the condition of weakened, but not impoverished,\ngentility. Each of them is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cparadise of demi-fortunes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Each of them\nis of that intermediate size between a village and a city which any\nplace has outgrown when the presence of a well-dressed stranger walking\nup and down the main street ceases to be a matter of public curiosity\nand private speculation, as frequently happens, during the busier months\nof the year, in considerable commercial centres like Salem. They both\nhave grand old recollections to fall back upon,--times when they looked\nforward to commercial greatness, and when the portly gentlemen in cocked\nhats, who built their now decaying wharves and sent out their ships all\nover the world, dreamed that their fast-growing port was to be the Tyre\nor the Carthage of the rich British Colony. Great houses, like that once\nlived in by Lord Timothy Dexter, in Newburyport, remain as evidence of\nthe fortunes amassed in these places of old. Other mansions--like the\nRockingham House in Portsmouth (look at the white horse's tail before\nyou mount the broad staircase)--show that there was not only wealth, but\nstyle and state, in these quiet old towns during the last century. It is\nnot with any thought of pity or depreciation that we speak of them as in\na certain sense decayed towns; they did not fulfil their early promise\nof expansion, but they remain incomparably the most interesting places\nof their size in any of the three northernmost New England States. They\nhave even now prosperity enough to keep them in good condition, and\noffer the most attractive residences for quiet families, which, if they\nhad been English, would have lived in a palazzo at Genoa or Pisa, or\nsome other Continental Newburyport or Portsmouth.\n\nAs for the last of the three Ports, or Portland, it is getting too\nprosperous to be as attractive as its less northerly neighbors. Meant\nfor a fine old town, to ripen like a Cheshire cheese within its walls\nof ancient rind, burrowed by crooked alleys and mottled with venerable\nmould, it seems likely to sacrifice its mellow future to a vulgar\nmaterial prosperity. Still it remains invested with many of its old\ncharms, as yet, and will forfeit its place among this admirable trio\nonly when it gets a hotel with unequivocal marks of having been built\nand organized in the present century.\n\n--It was one of the old square palaces of the North, in which Bernard\nLangdon, the son of Wentworth, was born. If he had had the luck to be\nan only child, he might have lived as his father had done, letting his\nmeagre competence smoulder on almost without consuming, like the fuel\nin an air-tight stove. But after Master Bernard came Miss Dorothea\nElizabeth Wentworth Langdon, and then Master William Pepperell Langdon,\nand others, equally well named,--a string of them, looking, when they\nstood in a row in prayer-time, as if they would fit a set of Pandean\npipes, of from three feet upward in dimensions. The door of the\nair-tight stove has to be opened, under such circumstances, you may well\nsuppose! So it happened that our young man had been obliged, from an\nearly period, to do something to support himself, and found himself\nstopped short in his studies by the inability of the good people at home\nto furnish him the present means of support as a student.\n\nYou will understand now why the young man wanted me to give him a\ncertificate of his fitness to teach, and why I did not choose to urge\nhim to accept the aid which a meek country-boy from a family without\nante-Revolutionary recollections would have thankfully received. Go he\nmust,--that was plain enough. He would not be content otherwise. He was\nnot, however, to give up his studies; and as it is customary to allow\nhalf-time to students engaged in school-keeping,--that is, to count a\nyear, so employed, if the student also keep on with his professional\nstudies, as equal to six months of the three years he is expected to\nbe under an instructor before applying for his degree,--he would not\nnecessarily lose more than a few months of time. He had a small library\nof professional books, which he could take with him.\n\nSo he left my teaching and that of my estimable colleagues, carrying\nwith him my certificate, that Mr. Bernard C. Langdon was a young\ngentleman of excellent moral character, of high intelligence and good\neducation, and that his services would be of great value in any school,\nacademy, or other institution, where young persons of-either sex were to\nbe instructed.\n\nI confess, that expression, \u00e2\u0080\u009ceither sex,\u00e2\u0080\u009d ran a little thick, as I\nmay say, from my pen. For, although the young man bore a very fair\ncharacter, and there was no special cause for doubting his discretion,\nI considered him altogether too good-looking, in the first place, to be\nlet loose in a roomful of young girls. I didn't want him to fall in love\njust then--and if half a dozen girls fell in love with him, as they most\nassuredly would, if brought into too near relations with him, why, there\nwas no telling what gratitude and natural sensibility might bring about.\n\nCertificates are, for the most part, like ostrich-eggs; the giver never\nknows what is hatched out of them. But once in a thousand times they\nact as curses are said to,--come home to roost. Give them often enough,\nuntil it gets to be a mechanical business, and, some day or other, you\nwill get caught warranting somebody's ice not to melt in any climate, or\nsomebody's razors to be safe in the hands of the youngest children.\n\nI had an uneasy feeling, after giving this certificate. It might be all\nright enough; but if it happened to end badly, I should always reproach\nmyself. There was a chance, certainly, that it would lead him or others\ninto danger or wretchedness. Any one who looked at this young man could\nnot fail to see that he was capable of fascinating and being fascinated.\nThose large, dark eyes of his would sink into the white soul of a\nyoung girl as the black cloth sunk into the snow in Franklin's famous\nexperiment. Or, on the other hand, if the rays of a passionate nature\nshould ever be concentrated on them, they would be absorbed into the\nvery depths of his nature, and then his blood would turn to flame and\nburn his life out of him, until his cheeks grew as white as the ashes\nthat cover a burning coal.\n\nI wish I had not said either sex in my certificate. An academy for young\ngentlemen, now; that sounds cool and unimaginative. A boys' school, that\nwould be a very good place for him;--some of them are pretty rough, but\nthere is nerve enough in that old Wentworth strain of blood; he can give\nany country fellow, of the common stock, twenty pounds, and hit him out\nof time in ten minutes. But to send such a young fellow as that out a\ngirl's-nesting! to give this falcon a free pass into all the dove-cotes!\nI was a fool,--that's all.\n\nI brooded over the mischief which might come out of these two words\nuntil it seemed to me that they were charged with destiny. I could\nhardly sleep for thinking what a train I might have been laying, which\nmight take a spark any day, and blow up nobody knows whose peace or\nprospects. What I dreaded most was one of those miserable matrimonial\nmisalliances where a young fellow who does not know himself as yet\nflings his magnificent future into the checked apron-lap of some\nfresh-faced, half-bred country-girl, no more fit to be mated with him\nthan her father's horse to go in double harness with Flora Temple. To\nthink of the eagle's wings, being clipped so that he shall never\nlift himself over the farm-yard fence! Such things happen, and always\nmust,--because, as one of us said awhile ago, a man always loves,\na woman, and a woman a man, unless some good reason exists to the\ncontrary. You think yourself a very fastidious young man, my friend; but\nthere are probably at least five-thousand young women in these United\nStates, any one of whom you would certainly marry, if you were thrown\nmuch into her company, and nobody more attractive were near, and she had\nno objection. And you, my dear young lady, justly pride yourself on your\ndiscerning delicacy; but if I should say that there are twenty thousand\nyoung men, any one of whom, if he offered his hand and heart under\nfavorable circumstances, you would\n\n          \u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst endure, then pity, then embrace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI should be much more imprudent than I mean to be, and you would, no\ndoubt, throw down a story in which I hope to interest you.\n\nI had settled it in my mind that this young fellow had a career marked\nout for him. He should begin in the natural way, by taking care of poor\npatients in one of the public charities, and work his way up to a better\nkind of practice,--better, that is, in the vulgar, worldly sense. The\ngreat and good Boerhaave used to say, as I remember very well, that the\npoor were his best patients; for God was their paymaster. But everybody\nis not as patient as Boerhaave, nor as deserving; so that the rich,\nthough not, perhaps, the best patients, are good enough for common\npractitioners. I suppose Boerhaave put up with them when he could not\nget poor ones, as he left his daughter two millions of florins when he\ndied.\n\nNow if this young man once got into the wide streets, he would sweep\nthem clear of his rivals of the same standing; and as I was getting\nindifferent to business, and old Dr. Kilham was growing careless, and\nhad once or twice prescribed morphine when he meant quinine, there would\nsoon be an opening into the Doctor's Paradise,--the streets with only\none side to them. Then I would have him strike a bold stroke,--set up a\nnice little coach, and be driven round like a first-class London doctor,\ninstead of coasting about in a shabby one-horse concern and casting\nanchor opposite his patients' doors like a Cape Ann fishing-smack. By\nthe time he was thirty, he would have knocked the social pawns out of\nhis way, and be ready to challenge a wife from the row of great pieces\nin the background. I would not have a man marry above his level, so as\nto become the appendage of a powerful family-connection; but I would not\nhave him marry until he knew his level,--that is, again, looking at the\nmatter in a purely worldly point of view, and not taking the sentiments\nat all into consideration. But remember, that a young man, using large\nendowments wisely and fortunately, may put himself on a level with\nthe highest in the land in ten brilliant years of spirited, unflagging\nlabor. And to stand at the very top of your calling in a great city is\nsomething in itself,--that is, if you like money, and influence, and a\nseat on the platform at public lectures, and gratuitous tickets to all\nsorts of places where you don't want to go, and, what is a good deal\nbetter than any of these things, a sense of power, limited, it may be,\nbut absolute in its range, so that all the Caesars and Napoleons would\nhave to stand aside, if they came between you and the exercise of your\nspecial vocation.\n\nThat is what I thought this young fellow might have come to; and now I\nhave let him go off into the country with my certificate, that he is fit\nto teach in a school for either sex! Ten to one he will run like a moth\ninto a candle, right into one of those girls'-nests, and get tangled up\nin some sentimental folly or other, and there will be the end of him.\nOh, yes! country doctor,--half a dollar a visit,--drive, drive, drive\nall day,--get up at night and harness your own horse,--drive again\nten miles in a snow-storm, shake powders out of two phials, (pulv.\nglycyrrhiz., pulv. gum. acac. as partes equates,)--drive back again,\nif you don't happen to get stuck in a drift, no home, no peace, no\ncontinuous meals, no unbroken sleep, no Sunday, no holiday, no social\nintercourse, but one eternal jog, jog, jog, in a sulky, until you feel\nlike the mummy of an Indian who had been buried in the sitting posture,\nand was dug up a hundred years afterwards! Why did n't I warn him about\nlove and all that nonsense? Why didn't I tell him he had nothing to do\nwith it, yet awhile? Why did n't I hold up to him those awful examples\nI could have cited, where poor young fellows who could just keep\nthemselves afloat have hung a matrimonial millstone round their necks,\ntaking it for a life-preserver? All this of two words in a certificate!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. MR. BERNARD TRIES HIS HAND.\n\nWhether the Student advertised for a school, or whether he fell in with\nthe advertisement of a school-committee, is not certain. At any rate, it\nwas not long before he found himself the head of a large district,\nor, as it was called by the inhabitants, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeestric\u00e2\u0080\u009d school, in the\nflourishing inland village of Pequawkett, or, as it is commonly spelt,\nPigwacket Centre. The natives of this place would be surprised, if they\nshould hear that any of the readers of a work published in Boston were\nunacquainted with so remarkable a locality. As, however, some copies of\nit may be read at a distance from this distinguished metropolis, it may\nbe well to give a few particulars respecting the place, taken from the\nUniversal Gazetteer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPIGWACKET, sometimes spelt Pequawkett. A post-village and township\nin ------ Co., State of ------, situated in a fine agricultural\nregion, 2 thriving villages, Pigwacket Centre and Smithville, 3\nchurches, several school houses, and many handsome private residences.\nMink River runs through the town, navigable for small boats after heavy\nrains. Muddy Pond at N. E. section, well stocked with horn pouts,\neels, and shiners. Products, beef, pork, butter, cheese. Manufactures,\nshoe-pegs, clothes-pins, and tin-ware. Pop. 1373.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe reader may think there is nothing very remarkable implied in this\ndescription. If, however he had read the town-history, by the Rev.\nJabez Grubb, he would have learned, that, like the celebrated Little\nPedlington, it was distinguished by many very remarkable advantages.\nThus:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe situation of Pigwacket is eminently beautiful, looking down the\nlovely valley of Mink River, a tributary of the Musquash. The air is\nsalubrious, and many of the inhabitants have attained great age, several\nhaving passed the allotted period of 'three-score years and ten' before\nsuccumbing to any of the various 'ills that flesh is heir to.' Widow\nComfort Leevins died in 1836 AEt. LXXXVII. years. Venus, an African,\ndied in 1841, supposed to be C. years old. The people are distinguished\nfor intelligence, as has been frequently remarked by eminent\nlyceum-lecturers, who have invariably spoken in the highest terms of\na Pigwacket audience. There is a public library, containing nearly a\nhundred volumes, free to all subscribers. The preached word is well\nattended, there is a flourishing temperance society, and the schools are\nexcellent. It is a residence admirably adapted to refined families who\nrelish the beauties of Nature and the charms of society. The Honorable\nJohn Smith, formerly a member of the State Senate, was a native of this\ntown.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat is the way they all talk. After all, it is probably pretty much\nlike other inland New England towns in point of \u00e2\u0080\u009csalubrity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--that is,\ngives people their choice of dysentery or fever every autumn, with a\nseason-ticket for consumption, good all the year round. And so of the\nother pretences. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPigwacket audience,\u00e2\u0080\u009d forsooth! Was there ever an\naudience anywhere, though there wasn't a pair of eyes in it brighter\nthan pickled oysters, that did n't think it was \u00e2\u0080\u009cdistinguished for\nintelligence\u00e2\u0080\u009d?--\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe preached word\u00e2\u0080\u009d! That means the Rev. Jabez Grubb's\nsermons. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTemperance society\u00e2\u0080\u009d! \u00e2\u0080\u009cExcellent schools\u00e2\u0080\u009d! Ah, that is just\nwhat we were talking about.\n\nThe truth was, that District No. 1, Pigwacket Centre, had had a good\ndeal of trouble of late with its schoolmasters. The committee had done\ntheir best, but there were a number of well-grown and pretty rough young\nfellows who had got the upper-hand of the masters, and meant to keep it.\nTwo dynasties had fallen before the uprising of this fierce democracy.\nThis was a thing that used to be not very uncommon; but in so\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cintelligent\u00e2\u0080\u009d a community as that of Pigwacket Centre, in an era of\npublic libraries and lyceum-lectures, it was portentous and alarming.\n\nThe rebellion began under the ferule of Master Weeks, a slender youth\nfrom a country college, underfed, thin-blooded, sloping-shouldered,\nknock-kneed, straight-haired, weak-bearded, pale-eyed, wide-pupilled,\nhalf-colored; a common type enough in in-door races, not rich enough to\npick and choose in their alliances. Nature kills off a good many of this\nsort in the first teething-time, a few in later childhood, a good many\nagain in early adolescence; but every now and then one runs the gauntlet\nof her various diseases, or rather forms of one disease, and grows up,\nas Master Weeks had done.\n\nIt was a very foolish thing for him to try to inflict personal\npunishment on such a lusty young fellow as Abner Briggs, Junior, one\nof the \u00e2\u0080\u009chardest customers\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the way of a rough-and-tumble fight that\nthere were anywhere round. No doubt he had been insolent, but it would\nhave been better to overlook it. It pains me to report the events\nwhich took place when the master made his rash attempt to maintain his\nauthority. Abner Briggs, Junior, was a great, hulking fellow, who had\nbeen bred to butchering, but urged by his parents to attend school, in\norder to learn the elegant accomplishments of reading and writing,\nin which he was sadly deficient. He was in the habit of talking and\nlaughing pretty loud in school-hours, of throwing wads of paper reduced\nto a pulp by a natural and easy process, of occasional insolence and\ngeneral negligence. One of the soft, but unpleasant missiles just\nalluded to flew by the master's head one morning, and flattened itself\nagainst the wall, where it adhered in the form of a convex mass in alto\nrilievo. The master looked round and saw the young butcher's arm in an\nattitude which pointed to it unequivocally as the source from which the\nprojectile had taken its flight.\n\nMaster Weeks turned pale. He must \u00e2\u0080\u009click\u00e2\u0080\u009d Abner Briggs, Junior, or\nabdicate. So he determined to lick Abner Briggs, Junior.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome here, Sir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have insulted me and outraged the\ndecency of the schoolroom often enough! Hold out your hand!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young fellow grinned and held it out. The master struck at it with\nhis black ruler, with a will in the blow and a snapping of the eyes,\nas much as to say that he meant to make him smart this time. The young\nfellow pulled his hand back as the ruler came down, and the master hit\nhimself a vicious blow with it on the right knee. There are things no\nman can stand. The master caught the refractory youth by the collar and\nbegan shaking him, or rather shaking himself against him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLe' go o' that are coat, naow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the fellow, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor I 'll make ye!\n'T 'll take tew on yet' handle me, I tell ye, 'n' then ye caant dew\nit!\u00e2\u0080\u009d--and the young pupil returned the master's attention by catching\nhold of his collar.\n\nWhen it comes to that, the best man, not exactly in the moral sense, but\nrather in the material, and more especially the muscular point of view,\nis very apt to have the best of it, irrespectively of the merits of the\ncase. So it happened now. The unfortunate schoolmaster found himself\ntaking the measure of the sanded floor, amidst the general uproar of the\nschool. From that moment his ferule was broken, and the school-committee\nvery soon had a vacancy to fill.\n\nMaster Pigeon, the successor of Master Weeks, was of better stature, but\nloosely put together, and slender-limbed. A dreadfully nervous kind of\nman he was, walked on tiptoe, started at sudden noises, was distressed\nwhen he heard a whisper, had a quick, suspicious look, and was always\nsaying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHush?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and putting his hands to his ears. The boys were not\nlong in finding out this nervous weakness, of course. In less than a\nweek a regular system of torments was inaugurated, full of the most\ndiabolical malice and ingenuity. The exercises of the conspirators\nvaried from day to day, but consisted mainly of foot-scraping, solos\non the slate-pencil, (making it screech on the slate,) falling of heavy\nbooks, attacks of coughing, banging of desk-lids, boot-creaking, with\nsounds as of drawing a cork from time to time, followed by suppressed\nchuckles.\n\nMaster Pigeon grew worse and worse under these inflictions. The rascally\nboys always had an excuse for any one trick they were caught at. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCould\nn' help coughin', Sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSlipped out o' m' han', Sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid n' go to,\nSir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid n' dew't o' purpose, Sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And so on,--always the best of\nreasons for the most outrageous of behavior. The master weighed himself\nat the grocer's on a platform balance, some ten days after he began\nkeeping the school. At the end of a week he weighed himself again. He\nhad lost two pounds. At the end of another week he had lost five. He\nmade a little calculation, based on these data, from which he learned\nthat in a certain number of months, going on at this rate, he should\ncome to weigh precisely nothing at all; and as this was a sum in\nsubtraction he did not care to work out in practice, Master Pigeon took\nto himself wings and left the school-committee in possession of a letter\nof resignation and a vacant place to fill once more.\n\nThis was the school to which Mr. Bernard Langdon found himself appointed\nas master. He accepted the place conditionally, with the understanding\nthat he should leave it at the end of a month, if he were tired of it.\n\nThe advent of Master Langdon to Pigwacket Centre created a much more\nlively sensation than had attended that of either of his predecessors.\nLooks go a good way all the world over, and though there were several\ngood-looking people in the place, and Major Bush was what the natives of\nthe town called a \u00e2\u0080\u009chahnsome mahn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d that is, big, fat, and red, yet the\nsight of a really elegant young fellow, with the natural air which grows\nup with carefully-bred young persons, was a novelty. The Brahmin blood\nwhich came from his grandfather as well as from his mother, a direct\ndescendant of the old Flynt family, well known by the famous tutor,\nHenry Flynt, (see Cat. Harv. Anno 1693,) had been enlivened and enriched\nby that of the Wentworths, which had had a good deal of ripe old Madeira\nand other generous elements mingled with it, so that it ran to gout\nsometimes in the old folks and to high spirit, warm complexion, and\ncurly hair in some of the younger ones. The soft curling hair Mr.\nBernard had inherited,--something, perhaps, of the high spirit; but that\nwe shall have a chance of finding out by and by. But the long sermons\nand the frugal board of his Brahmin ancestry, with his own habits of\nstudy, had told upon his color, which was subdued to something more of\ndelicacy than one would care to see in a young fellow with rough work\nbefore him. This, however, made him look more interesting, or, as the\nyoung ladies at Major Bush's said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cinterestin'.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen Mr. Bernard showed himself at meeting, on the first Sunday after\nhis arrival, it may be supposed that a good many eyes were turned upon\nthe young schoolmaster. There was something heroic in his coming forward\nso readily to take a place which called for a strong hand, and a prompt,\nsteady will to guide it. In fact, his position was that of a military\nchieftain on the eve of a battle. Everybody knew everything in Pigwacket\nCentre; and it was an understood thing that the young rebels meant to\nput down the new master, if they could. It was natural that the two\nprettiest girls in the village, called in the local dialect, as nearly\nas our limited alphabet will represent it, Alminy Cutterr, and Arvilly\nBraowne, should feel and express an interest in the good-looking\nstranger, and that, when their flattering comments were repeated in the\nhearing of their indigenous admirers, among whom were some of the older\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cboys\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the school, it should not add to the amiable dispositions of\nthe turbulent youth.\n\nMonday came, and the new schoolmaster was in his chair at the upper end\nof the schoolhouse, on the raised platform. The rustics looked at his\nhandsome face, thoughtful, peaceful, pleasant, cheerful, but sharply cut\nround the lips and proudly lighted about the eyes. The ringleader of\nthe mischief-makers, the young butcher who has before figured in this\nnarrative, looked at him stealthily, whenever he got a chance to study\nhim unobserved; for the truth was, he felt uncomfortable, whenever he\nfound the large, dark eyes fixed on his own little, sharp, deep-set,\ngray ones. But he managed to study him pretty well,--first his face,\nthen his neck and shoulders, the set of his arms, the narrowing at the\nloins, the make of his legs, and the way he moved. In short, he examined\nhim as he would have examined a steer, to see what he could do and\nhow he would cut up. If he could only have gone to him and felt of his\nmuscles, he would have been entirely satisfied. He was not a very wise\nyouth, but he did know well enough, that, though big arms and legs are\nvery good things, there is something besides size that goes to make a\nman; and he had heard stories of a fighting-man, called \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Spider,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n from his attenuated proportions, who was yet a terrible hitter in the\nring, and had whipped many a big-limbed fellow, in and out of the roped\narena.\n\nNothing could be smoother than the way in which everything went on\nfor the first day or two. The new master was so kind and courteous, he\nseemed to take everything in such a natural, easy way, that there was no\nchance to pick a quarrel with him. He in the mean time thought it best\nto watch the boys and young men for a day or two with as little show\nof authority as possible. It was easy enough to see that he would have\noccasion for it before long.\n\nThe schoolhouse was a grim, old, red, one-story building, perched on a\nbare rock at the top of a hill,--partly because this was a conspicuous\nsite for the temple of learning, and partly because land is cheap where\nthere is no chance even for rye or buckwheat, and the very sheep find\nnothing to nibble. About the little porch were carved initials and\ndates, at various heights, from the stature of nine to that of eighteen.\nInside were old unpainted desks,--unpainted, but browned with the umber\nof human contact,--and hacked by innumerable jack-knives. It was long\nsince the walls had been whitewashed, as might be conjectured by the\nvarious traces left upon them, wherever idle hands or sleepy heads could\nreach them. A curious appearance was noticeable on various higher parts\nof the wall: namely, a wart-like eruption, as one would be tempted to\ncall it, being in reality a crop of the soft missiles before mentioned,\nwhich, adhering in considerable numbers, and hardening after the usual\nfashion of papier-mache, formed at last permanent ornaments of the\nedifice.\n\nThe young master's quick eye soon noticed that a particular part of the\nwall was most favored with these ornamental appendages. Their position\npointed sufficiently clearly to the part of the room they came from.\nIn fact, there was a nest of young mutineers just there, which must be\nbroken up by a coup d'etat. This was easily effected by redistributing\nthe seats and arranging the scholars according to classes, so that a\nmischievous fellow, charged full of the rebellious imponderable, should\nfind himself between two non-conductors, in the shape of small boys of\nstudious habits. It was managed quietly enough, in such a plausible sort\nof way that its motive was not thought of. But its effects were soon\nfelt; and then began a system of correspondence by signs, and the\nthrowing of little scrawls done up in pellets, and announced by\npreliminary a'h'ms! to call the attention of the distant youth\naddressed. Some of these were incendiary documents, devoting the\nschoolmaster to the lower divinities, as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca stuck-up dandy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca\npurse-proud aristocrat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca sight too big for his, etc.,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and holding\nhim up in a variety of equally forcible phrases to the indignation of\nthe youthful community of School District No. 1, Pigwacket Centre.\n\nPresently the draughtsman of the school set a caricature in circulation,\nlabelled, to prevent mistakes, with the schoolmaster's name. An immense\nbell-crowned hat, and a long, pointed, swallow-tailed coat showed that\nthe artist had in his mind the conventional dandy, as shown in prints\nof thirty or forty years ago, rather than any actual human aspect of the\ntime. But it was passed round among the boys and made its laugh,\nhelping of course to undermine the master's authority, as \u00e2\u0080\u009cPunch\u00e2\u0080\u009d or the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCharivari\u00e2\u0080\u009d takes the dignity out of an obnoxious minister. One morning,\non going to the schoolroom, Master Langdon found an enlarged copy of\nthis sketch, with its label, pinned on the door. He took it down,\nsmiled a little, put it into his pocket, and entered the schoolroom. An\ninsidious silence prevailed, which looked as if some plot were brewing.\nThe boys were ripe for mischief, but afraid. They had really no fault to\nfind with the master, except that he was dressed like a gentleman,\nwhich a certain class of fellows always consider a personal insult to\nthemselves. But the older ones were evidently plotting, and more than\nonce the warning a'h'm! was heard, and a dirty little scrap of paper\nrolled into a wad shot from one seat to another. One of these happened\nto strike the stove-funnel, and lodged on the master's desk. He was cool\nenough not to seem to notice it. He secured it, however, and found\nan opportunity to look at it, without being observed by the boys. It\nrequired no immediate notice.\n\nHe who should have enjoyed the privilege of looking upon Mr. Bernard\nLangdon the next morning, when his toilet was about half finished, would\nhave had a very pleasant gratuitous exhibition. First he buckled the\nstrap of his trousers pretty tightly. Then he took up a pair of heavy\ndumb-bells, and swung them for a few minutes; then two great \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndian\nclubs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with which he enacted all sorts of impossible-looking feats. His\nlimbs were not very large, nor his shoulders remarkably broad; but if\nyou knew as much of the muscles as all persons who look at statues and\npictures with a critical eye ought to have learned,--if you knew the\ntrapezius, lying diamond-shaped over the back and shoulders like\na monk's cowl,--or the deltoid, which caps the shoulder like an\nepaulette,--or the triceps, which furnishes the calf of the upper\narm,--or the hard-knotted biceps,--any of the great sculptural\nlandmarks, in fact,--you would have said there was a pretty show of\nthem, beneath the white satiny skin of Mr. Bernard Langdon. And if you\nhad seen him, when he had laid down the Indian clubs, catch hold of a\nleather strap that hung from the beam of the old-fashioned ceiling,--and\nlift and lower himself over and over again by his left hand alone, you\nmight have thought it a very simple and easy thing to do, until you\ntried to do it yourself. Mr. Bernard looked at himself with the eye\nof an expert. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPretty well!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said;--\u00e2\u0080\u009cnot so much fallen off as I\nexpected.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then he set up his bolster in a very knowing sort of way,\nand delivered two or three blows straight as rulers and swift as winks.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat will do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Then, as if determined to make a certainty of\nhis condition, he took a dynamometer from one of the drawers in his old\nveneered bureau. First he squeezed it with his two hands. Then he placed\nit on the floor and lifted, steadily, strongly. The springs creaked\nand cracked; the index swept with a great stride far up into the high\nfigures of the scale; it was a good lift. He was satisfied. He sat down\non the edge of his bed and looked at his cleanly-shaped arms. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I\nstrike one of those boobies, I am afraid I shall spoil him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\nYet this young man, when weighed with his class at the college, could\nbarely turn one hundred and forty-two pounds in the scale,--not a heavy\nweight, surely; but some of the middle weights, as the present English\nchampion, for instance, seem to be of a far finer quality of muscle than\nthe bulkier fellows.\n\nThe master took his breakfast with a good appetite that morning, but was\nperhaps rather more quiet than usual. After breakfast he went up-stairs\nand put, on a light loose frock, instead of that which he commonly wore,\nwhich was a close-fitting and rather stylish one. On his way to\nschool he met Alminy Cutterr, who happened to be walking in the other\ndirection. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-morning, Miss Cutter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; for she and another\nyoung lady had been introduced to him, on a former occasion, in the\nusual phrase of polite society in presenting ladies to gentlemen,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr.\nLangdon, let me make y' acquainted with Miss Cutterr;--let me make y'\nacquainted with Miss Braowne.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-morning\u00e2\u0080\u009d; to which she\nreplied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-mornin', Mr. Langdon. Haow's your haalth?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The answer\nto this question ought naturally to have been the end of the talk; but\nAlminy Cutterr lingered and looked as if she had something more on her\nmind.\n\nA young fellow does not require a great experience to read a simple\ncountry-girl's face as if it were a sign-board. Alminy was a good soul,\nwith red cheeks and bright eyes, kind-hearted as she could be, and it\nwas out of the question for her to hide her thoughts or feelings like\na fine lady. Her bright eyes were moist and her red cheeks paler than\ntheir wont, as she said, with her lips quivering, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Mr. Langdon, them\nboys 'll be the death of ye, if ye don't take caar!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, what's the matter, my dear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Bernard.--Don't think there\nwas anything very odd in that \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the second interview with a\nvillage belle;--some of these woman-tamers call a girl \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d after\nfive minutes' acquaintance, and it sounds all right as they say it. But\nyou had better not try it at a venture.\n\nIt sounded all right to Alminy, as Mr. Bernard said it.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI 'll tell ye\nwhat's the mahtterr,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, in a frightened voice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAhbner 's go'n'\nto car' his dog, 'n' he'll set him on ye'z sure 'z y' 'r' alive. 'T's\nthe same cretur that haaf eat up Eben Squires's little Jo, a year come\nnex' Faast day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNow this last statement was undoubtedly overcolored; as little Jo\nSquires was running about the village,--with an ugly scar on his arm, it\nis true, where the beast had caught him with his teeth, on the occasion\nof the child's taking liberties with him, as he had been accustomed\nto do with a good-tempered Newfoundland dog, who seemed to like being\npulled and hauled round by children. After this the creature was\ncommonly muzzled, and, as he was fed on raw meat chiefly, was always\nready for a fight, which he was occasionally indulged in, when anything\nstout enough to match him could be found in any of the neighboring\nvillages.\n\nTiger, or, more briefly, Tige, the property of Abner Briggs, Junior,\nbelonged to a species not distinctly named in scientific books, but well\nknown to our country-folks under the name \u00e2\u0080\u009cYallah dog.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They do not\nuse this expression as they would say black dog or white dog, but\nwith almost as definite a meaning as when they speak of a terrier or a\nspaniel. A \u00e2\u0080\u009cyallah dog\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a large canine brute, of a dingy old-flannel\ncolor, of no particular breed except his own, who hangs round a tavern\nor a butcher's shop, or trots alongside of a team, looking as if he were\ndisgusted with the world, and the world with him. Our inland population,\nwhile they tolerate him, speak of him with contempt. Old ______, of\nMeredith Bridge, used to twit the sun for not shining on cloudy days,\nswearing, that, if he hung up his \u00e2\u0080\u009cyallah dog,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would make a better\nshow of daylight. A country fellow, abusing a horse of his neighbor's,\nvowed, that, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif he had such a hoss, he'd swap him for a `yallah\ndog,'--and then shoot the dog.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTige was an ill-conditioned brute by nature, and art had not improved\nhim by cropping his ears and tail and investing him with a spiked\ncollar. He bore on his person, also, various not ornamental scars, marks\nof old battles; for Tige had fight in him, as was said before, and\nas might be guessed by a certain bluntness about the muzzle, with\na projection of the lower jaw, which looked as if there might be a\nbull-dog stripe among the numerous bar-sinisters of his lineage.\n\nIt was hardly fair, however, to leave Alminy Cutterr waiting while this\npiece of natural history was telling.--As she spoke of little Jo, who\nhad been \u00e2\u0080\u009chaaf eat up\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Tige, she could not contain her sympathies,\nand began to cry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, my dear little soul,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Bernard, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat are you worried\nabout? I used to play with a bear when I was a boy; and the bear used to\nhug me, and I used to kiss him,--so!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was too bad of Mr. Bernard, only the second time he had seen Alminy;\nbut her kind feelings had touched him, and that seemed the most natural\nway of expressing his gratitude. Ahniny looked round to see if anybody\nwas near; she saw nobody, so of course it would do no good to \u00e2\u0080\u009choller.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n She saw nobody; but a stout young fellow, leading a yellow dog, muzzled,\nsaw her through a crack in a picket fence, not a great way off the road.\nMany a year he had been \u00e2\u0080\u009changin' 'raoun'\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alminy, and never did he see\nany encouraging look, or hear any \u00e2\u0080\u009cBehave, naow!\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, naow, a'n't\nye 'shamed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d or other forbidding phrase of acquiescence, such as village\nbelles under stand as well as ever did the nymph who fled to the willows\nin the eclogue we all remember.\n\nNo wonder he was furious, when he saw the school master, who had never\nseen the girl until within a week, touching with his lips those rosy\ncheeks which he had never dared to approach. But that was all; it was\na sudden impulse; and the master turned away from the young girl,\nlaughing, and telling her not to fret herself about him,--he would take\ncare of himself.\n\nSo Master Langdon walked on toward his school-house, not displeased,\nperhaps, with his little adventure, nor immensely elated by it; for he\nwas one of the natural class of the sex-subduers, and had had many a\nsmile without asking, which had been denied to the feeble youth who try\nto win favor by pleading their passion in rhyme, and even to the\nmore formidable approaches of young officers in volunteer companies,\nconsidered by many to be quite irresistible to the fair who have once\nbeheld them from their windows in the epaulettes and plumes and sashes\nof the \u00e2\u0080\u009cPigwacket Invincibles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or the \u00e2\u0080\u009cHackmatack Rangers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMaster Langdon took his seat and began the exercises of his school. The\nsmaller boys recited their lessons well enough, but some of the larger\nones were negligent and surly. He noticed one or two of them looking\ntoward the door, as if expecting somebody or something in that\ndirection. At half past nine o'clock, Abner Briggs, Junior, who had not\nyet shown himself, made his appearance. He was followed by his \u00e2\u0080\u009cyallah\ndog,\u00e2\u0080\u009d without his muzzle, who squatted down very grimly near the door,\nand gave a wolfish look round the room, as if he were considering which\nwas the plumpest boy to begin with. The young butcher, meanwhile, went\nto his seat, looking somewhat flushed, except round the lips, which were\nhardly as red as common, and set pretty sharply.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPut out that dog, Abner Briggs!\u00e2\u0080\u009d--The master spoke as the captain\nspeaks to the helmsman, when there are rocks foaming at the lips, right\nunder his lee.\n\nAbner Briggs answered as the helmsman answers, when he knows he has a\nmutinous crew round him that mean to run the ship on the reef, and is\none of the mutineers himself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPut him aout y'rself, 'f ye a'n't afeard\non him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe master stepped into the aisle: The great cur showed his teeth,--and\nthe devilish instincts of his old wolf-ancestry looked out of his eyes,\nand flashed from his sharp tusks, and yawned in his wide mouth and deep\nred gullet.\n\nThe movements of animals are so much quicker than those of human beings\ncommonly are, that they avoid blows as easily as one of us steps out of\nthe way of an ox-cart. It must be a very stupid dog that lets himself be\nrun over by a fast driver in his gig; he can jump out of the wheel's way\nafter the tire has already touched him. So, while one is lifting a stick\nto strike or drawing back his foot to kick, the beast makes his spring,\nand the blow or the kick comes too late.\n\nIt was not so this time. The master was a fencer, and something of\na boxer; he had played at singlestick, and was used to watching an\nadversary's eye and coming down on him without any of those premonitory\nsymptoms by which unpractised persons show long beforehand what mischief\nthey meditate.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOut with you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, fiercely,--and explained what he meant by\na sudden flash of his foot that clashed the yellow dog's white teeth\ntogether like the springing of a bear-trap. The cur knew he had found\nhis master at the first word and glance, as low animals on four legs, or\na smaller number, always do; and the blow took him so by surprise, that\nit curled him up in an instant, and he went bundling out of the open\nschoolhouse-door with a most pitiable yelp, and his stump of a tail shut\ndown as close as his owner ever shut the short, stubbed blade of his\njack-knife.\n\nIt was time for the other cur to find who his master.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFollow your dog, Abner Briggs!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Master Langdon.\n\nThe stout butcher-youth looked round, but the rebels were all cowed and\nsat still.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll go when I'm ready,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,--\u00e2\u0080\u009c'n' I guess I won't go afore I'm\nready.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou're ready now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Master Langdon, turning up his cuffs so\nthat the little boys noticed the yellow gleam of a pair of gold\nsleeve-buttons, once worn by Colonel Percy Wentworth, famous in the Old\nFrench War.\n\nAbner Briggs, Junior, did not apparently think he was ready, at any\nrate; for he rose up in his place, and stood with clenched fists,\ndefiant, as the master strode towards him. The master knew the fellow\nwas really frightened, for all his looks, and that he must have no time\nto rally. So he caught him suddenly by the collar, and, with one great\npull, had him out over his desk and on the open floor. He gave him a\nsharp fling backwards and stood looking at him.\n\nThe rough-and-tumble fighters all clinch, as everybody knows; and Abner\nBriggs, Junior, was one of that kind. He remembered how he had floored\nMaster Weeks, and he had just \u00e2\u0080\u009cspunk\u00e2\u0080\u009d enough left in him to try to\nrepeat his former successful experiment an the new master. He sprang at\nhim, open-handed, to clutch him. So the master had to strike,--once, but\nvery hard, and just in the place to tell. No doubt, the authority that\ndoth hedge a schoolmaster added to the effect of the blow; but the blow\nwas itself a neat one, and did not require to be repeated.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow go home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the master, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand don't let me see you or your dog\nhere again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he turned his cuffs down over the gold sleeve-buttons.\n\nThis finished the great Pigwacket Centre School rebellion. What could\nbe done with a master who was so pleasant as long as the boys behaved\ndecently, and such a terrible fellow when he got \u00e2\u0080\u009criled,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as they\ncalled it? In a week's time everything was reduced to order, and the\nschool-committee were delighted. The master, however, had received a\nproposition so much more agreeable and advantageous, that he informed\nthe committee he should leave at the end of his month, having in his eye\na sensible and energetic young college-graduate who would be willing and\nfully competent to take his place.\n\nSo, at the expiration of the appointed time, Bernard Langdon, late\nmaster of the School District No. 1, Pigwacket Centre, took his\ndeparture from that place for another locality, whither we shall follow\nhim, carrying with him the regrets of the committee, of most of the\nscholars, and of several young ladies; also two locks of hair, sent\nunbeknown to payrents, one dark and one warmish auburn, inscribed with\nthe respective initials of Alminy Cutterr and Arvilly Braowne.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. THE MOTH FLIES INTO THE CANDLE.\n\nThe invitation which Mr. Bernard Langdon had accepted came from the\nBoard of Trustees of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cApollinean Female Institute,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a school for the\neducation of young ladies, situated in the flourishing town of Rockland.\nThis was an establishment on a considerable scale, in which a hundred\nscholars or thereabouts were taught the ordinary English branches,\nseveral of the modern languages, something of Latin, if desired, with a\nlittle natural philosophy, metaphysics, and rhetoric, to finish off with\nin the last year, and music at any time when they would pay for it. At\nthe close of their career in the Institute, they were submitted to a\ngrand public examination, and received diplomas tied in blue ribbons,\nwhich proclaimed them with a great flourish of capitals to be graduates\nof the Apollinean Female Institute.\n\nRockland was a town of no inconsiderable pretensions. It was ennobled\nby lying at the foot of a mountain,--called by the working-folks of\nthe place \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Maounting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--which sufficiently showed that it was the\nprincipal high land of the district in which it was situated. It lay to\nthe south of this, and basked in the sunshine as Italy stretches herself\nbefore the Alps. To pass from the town of Tamarack on the north of\nthe mountain to Rockland on the south was like crossing from Coire to\nChiavenna.\n\nThere is nothing gives glory and grandeur and romance and mystery to\na place like the impending presence of a high mountain. Our beautiful\nNorthampton with its fair meadows and noble stream is lovely enough, but\nowes its surpassing attraction to those twin summits which brood over it\nlike living presences, looking down into its streets as if they were its\ntutelary divinities, dressing and undressing their green shrines,\nrobing themselves in jubilant sunshine or in sorrowing clouds, and doing\npenance in the snowy shroud of winter, as if they had living hearts\nunder their rocky ribs and changed their mood like the children of the\nsoil at their feet, who grow up under their almost parental smiles and\nfrowns. Happy is the child whose first dreams of heaven are blended\nwith the evening glories of Mount Holyoke, when the sun is firing its\ntreetops, and gilding the white walls that mark its one human dwelling!\nIf the other and the wilder of the two summits has a scowl of terror in\nits overhanging brows, yet is it a pleasing fear to look upon its savage\nsolitudes through the barred nursery-windows in the heart of the sweet,\ncompanionable village.--And how the mountains love their children! The\nsea is of a facile virtue, and will run to kiss the first comer in any\nport he visits; but the chaste mountains sit apart, and show their faces\nonly in the midst of their own families.\n\nThe Mountain which kept watch to the north of Rockland lay waste and\nalmost inviolate through much of its domain. The catamount still glared\nfrom the branches of its old hemlocks on the lesser beasts that strayed\nbeneath him. It was not long since a wolf had wandered down, famished in\nthe winter's dearth, and left a few bones and some tufts of wool of what\nhad been a lamb in the morning. Nay, there were broad-footed tracks in\nthe snow only two years previously, which could not be mistaken;--the\nblack bear alone could have set that plantigrade seal, and little\nchildren must come home early from school and play, for he is an\nindiscriminate feeder when he is hungry, and a little child would not\ncome amiss when other game was wanting.\n\nBut these occasional visitors may have been mere wanderers, which,\nstraying along in the woods by day, and perhaps stalking through the\nstreets of still villages by night, had worked their way along down from\nthe ragged mountain-spurs of higher latitudes. The one feature of The\nMountain that shed the brownest horror on its woods was the existence\nof the terrible region known as Rattlesnake Ledge, and still tenanted\nby those damnable reptiles, which distil a fiercer venom under our cold\nnorthern sky than the cobra himself in the land of tropical spices and\npoisons.\n\nFrom the earliest settlement of the place, this fact had been, next\nto the Indians, the reigning nightmare of the inhabitants. It was easy\nenough, after a time, to drive away the savages; for \u00e2\u0080\u009ca screeching\nIndian Divell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as our fathers called him, could not crawl into the\ncrack of a rock to escape from his pursuers. But the venomous population\nof Rattlesnake Ledge had a Gibraltar for their fortress that might have\ndefied the siege-train dragged to the walls of Sebastopol. In its deep\nembrasures and its impregnable easemates they reared their families,\nthey met in love or wrath, they twined together in family knots, they\nhissed defiance in hostile clans, they fed, slept, hibernated, and in\ndue time died in peace. Many a foray had the towns-people made, and many\na stuffed skin was shown as a trophy,--nay, there were families where\nthe children's first toy was made from the warning appendage that once\nvibrated to the wrath of one of these \u00e2\u0080\u009ccruel serpents.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sometimes one of\nthem, coaxed out by a warm sun, would writhe himself down the hillside\ninto the roads, up the walks that led to houses,--worse than this, into\nthe long grass, where the barefooted mowers would soon pass with\ntheir swinging scythes,--more rarely into houses, and on one memorable\noccasion, early in the last century, into the meeting-house, where he\ntook a position on the pulpit-stairs,--as is narrated in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAccount of\nSome Remarkable Providences,\u00e2\u0080\u009d etc., where it is suggested that a strong\ntendency of the Rev. Didymus Bean, the Minister at that time, towards\nthe Arminian Heresy may have had something to do with it, and that the\nSerpent supposed to have been killed on the Pulpit-Stairs was a false\nshow of the Daemon's Contrivance, he having come in to listen to a\nDiscourse which was a sweet Savour in his Nostrils, and, of course,\nnot being capable of being killed Himself. Others said, however, that,\nthough there was good Reason to think it was a Damon, yet he did come\nwith Intent to bite the Heel of that faithful Servant,--etc.\n\nOne Gilson is said to have died of the bite of a rattlesnake in\nthis town early in the present century. After this there was a\ngreat snake-hunt, in which very many of these venomous beasts were\nkilled,--one in particular, said to have been as big round as a\nstout man's arm, and to have had no less than forty joints to his\nrattle,--indicating, according to some, that he had lived forty years,\nbut, if we might put any faith in the Indian tradition, that he had\nkilled forty human beings,--an idle fancy, clearly. This hunt, however,\nhad no permanent effect in keeping down the serpent population.\nViviparous, creatures are a kind of specie-paying lot, but oviparous\nones only give their notes, as it were, for a future brood,--an egg\nbeing, so to speak, a promise to pay a young one by and by, if nothing\nhappen. Now the domestic habits of the rattlesnake are not studied very\nclosely, for obvious reasons; but it is, no doubt, to all intents and\npurposes oviparous. Consequently it has large families, and is not easy\nto kill out.\n\nIn the year 184-, a melancholy proof was afforded to the inhabitants of\nRockland, that the brood which infested The Mountain was not extirpated.\nA very interesting young married woman, detained at home at the time by\nthe state of her health, was bitten in the entry of her own house by a\nrattlesnake which had found its way down from The Mountain. Owing to the\nalmost instant employment of powerful remedies, the bite did not prove\nimmediately fatal; but she died within a few months of the time when she\nwas bitten.\n\nAll this seemed to throw a lurid kind of shadow over The Mountain. Yet,\nas many years passed without any accident, people grew comparatively\ncareless, and it might rather be said to add a fearful kind of interest\nto the romantic hillside, that the banded reptiles, which had been the\nterror of the red men for nobody knows how many thousand years, were\nthere still, with the same poison-bags and spring-teeth at the white\nmen's service, if they meddled with them.\n\nThe other natural features of Rockland were such as many of our pleasant\ncountry-towns can boast of. A brook came tumbling down the mountain-side\nand skirted the most thickly settled portion of the village. In the\nparts of its course where it ran through the woods, the water looked\nalmost as brown as coffee flowing from its urn,--to say like smoky\nquartz would perhaps give a better idea,--but in the open plain it\nsparkled over the pebbles white as a queen's diamonds. There were\nhuckleberry-pastures on the lower flanks of The Mountain, with plenty\nof the sweet-scented bayberry mingled with the other bushes. In other\nfields grew great store of high-bush blackberries. Along the roadside\nwere bayberry-bushes, hung all over with bright red coral pendants in\nautumn and far into the winter. Then there were swamps set thick with\ndingy alders, where the three-leaved arum and the skunk's-cabbage grew\nbroad and succulent, shelving down into black boggy pools here and there\nat the edge of which the green frog, stupidest of his tribe, sat waiting\nto be victimized by boy or snapping-turtle long after the shy and agile\nleopard-frog had taken the six-foot spring that plumped him into the\nmiddle of the pool. And on the neighboring banks the maiden-hair spread\nits flat disk of embroidered fronds on the wire-like stem that glistened\npolished and brown as the darkest tortoise-shell, and pale violets,\ncheated by the cold skies of their hues and perfume, sunned themselves\nlike white-cheeked invalids. Over these rose the old forest-trees,--the\nmaple, scarred with the wounds which had drained away its sweet\nlife-blood,--the beech, its smooth gray bark mottled so as to look\nlike the body of one of those great snakes of old that used to frighten\narmies, always the mark of lovers' knives, as in the days of Musidora\nand her swain,--the yellow birch, rough as the breast of Silenus in old\nmarbles,--the wild cherry, its little bitter fruit lying unheeded at its\nfoot,--and, soaring over all, the huge, coarse-barked, splintery-limbed,\ndark-mantled hemlock, in the depth of whose aerial solitudes the crow\nbrooded on her nest unscared, and the gray squirrel lived unharmed till\nhis incisors grew to look like ram's-horns.\n\nRockland would have been but half a town without its pond; Guinnepeg\nPond was the name of it, but the young ladies of the Apollinean\nInstitute were very anxious that it should be called Crystalline Lake.\nIt was here that the young folks used to sail in summer and skate in\nwinter; here, too, those queer, old, rum-scented good-for-nothing, lazy,\nstory-telling, half-vagabonds, who sawed a little wood or dug a few\npotatoes now and then under the pretence of working for their living,\nused to go and fish through the ice for pickerel every winter. And\nhere those three young people were drowned, a few summers ago, by the\nupsetting of a sail-boat in a sudden flaw of wind. There is not one of\nthese smiling ponds which has not devoured more youths and maidens than\nany of those monsters the ancients used to tell such lies about. But it\nwas a pretty pond, and never looked more innocent--so the native \u00e2\u0080\u009cbard\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n of Rockland said in his elegy--than on the morning when they found Sarah\nJane and Ellen Maria floating among the lily-pads.\n\nThe Apollinean Institute, or Institoot, as it was more commonly called,\nwas, in the language of its Prospectus, a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfirst-class Educational\nEstablishment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It employed a considerable corps of instructors to rough\nout and finish the hundred young lady scholars it sheltered beneath its\nroof. First, Mr. and Mrs. Peckham, the Principal and the Matron of the\nschool. Silas Peckham was a thorough Yankee, born on a windy part of\nthe coast, and reared chiefly on salt-fish. Everybody knows the type of\nYankee produced by this climate and diet: thin, as if he had been split\nand dried; with an ashen kind of complexion, like the tint of the food\nhe is made of; and about as sharp, tough, juiceless, and biting to deal\nwith as the other is to the taste. Silas Peckham kept a young ladies'\nschool exactly as he would have kept a hundred head of cattle,--for the\nsimple, unadorned purpose of making just as much money in just as few\nyears as could be safely done. Mr. Peckham gave very little personal\nattention to the department of instruction, but was always busy with\ncontracts for flour and potatoes, beef and pork, and other nutritive\nstaples, the amount of which required for such an establishment was\nenough to frighten a quartermaster. Mrs. Peckham was from the West,\nraised on Indian corn and pork, which give a fuller outline and a more\nhumid temperament, but may perhaps be thought to render people a little\ncoarse-fibred. Her specialty was to look after the feathering, cackling,\nroosting, rising, and general behavior of these hundred chicks. An\nhonest, ignorant woman, she could not have passed an examination in the\nyoungest class. So this distinguished institution was under the charge\nof a commissary and a housekeeper, and its real business was making\nmoney by taking young girls in as boarders.\n\nConnected with this, however, was the incidental fact, which the public\ntook for the principal one, namely, the business of instruction.\nMr. Peckham knew well enough that it was just as well to have good\ninstructors as bad ones, so far as cost was concerned, and a great deal\nbetter for the reputation of his feeding-establishment. He tried to\nget the best he could without paying too much, and, having got them, to\nscrew all the work out of them that could possibly be extracted.\n\nThere was a master for the English branches, with a young lady\nassistant. There was another young lady who taught French, of the\nahvaung and baundahng style, which does not exactly smack of the\nasphalt of the Boulevards. There was also a German teacher of music, who\nsometimes helped in French of the ahfaung and bauntaung style,--so that,\nbetween the two, the young ladies could hardly have been mistaken for\nParisians, by a Committee of the French Academy. The German teacher also\ntaught a Latin class after his fashion,--benna, a ben, gahboot, ahead,\nand so forth.\n\nThe master for the English branches had lately left the school for\nprivate reasons, which need not be here mentioned,--but he had gone,\nat any rate, and it was his place which had been offered to Mr. Bernard\nLangdon. The offer came just in season,--as, for various causes, he was\nwilling to leave the place where he had begun his new experience.\n\nIt was on a fine morning that Mr. Bernard, ushered in by Mr. Peckham,\nmade his appearance in the great schoolroom of the Apollinean Institute.\nA general rustle ran all round the seats when the handsome young man\nwas introduced. The principal carried him to the desk of the young lady\nEnglish assistant, Miss Darley by name, and introduced him to her.\n\nThere was not a great deal of study done that day. The young lady\nassistant had to point out to the new master the whole routine in which\nthe classes were engaged when their late teacher left, and which had\ngone on as well as it could since. Then Master Langdon had a great many\nquestions to ask, some relating to his new duties, and some,\nperhaps, implying a degree of curiosity not very unnatural under the\ncircumstances. The truth is, the general effect of the schoolroom, with\nits scores of young girls, all their eyes naturally centring on him with\nfixed or furtive glances, was enough to bewilder and confuse a young man\nlike Master Langdon, though he was not destitute of self-possession, as\nwe have already seen.\n\nYou cannot get together a hundred girls, taking them as they come, from\nthe comfortable and affluent classes, probably anywhere, certainly not\nin New England, without seeing a good deal of beauty. In fact, we very\ncommonly mean by beauty the way young girls look when there is\nnothing to hinder their looking as Nature meant them to. And the great\nschoolroom of the Apollinean Institute did really make so pretty a show\non the morning when Master Langdon entered it, that he might be pardoned\nfor asking Miss Darley more questions about his scholars than about\ntheir lessons.\n\nThere were girls of all ages: little creatures, some pallid and\ndelicate-looking, the offspring of invalid parents,--much given to\nbooks, not much to mischief, commonly spoken of as particularly good\nchildren, and contrasted with another sort, girls of more vigorous\norganization, who were disposed to laughing and play, and required a\nstrong hand to manage them; then young growing misses of every shade of\nSaxon complexion, and here and there one of more Southern hue: blondes,\nsome of them so translucent-looking that it seemed as if you could see\nthe souls in their bodies, like bubbles in glass, if souls were objects\nof sight; brunettes, some with rose-red colors, and some with that\nswarthy hue which often carries with it a heavily-shaded lip, and\nwhich, with pure outlines and outspoken reliefs, gives us some of our\nhandsomest women,--the women whom ornaments of plain gold adorn more\nthan any other parures; and again, but only here and there, one with\ndark hair and gray or blue eyes, a Celtic type, perhaps, but found in\nour native stock occasionally; rarest of all, a light-haired girl with\ndark eyes, hazel, brown, or of the color of that mountain-brook spoken\nof in this chapter, where it ran through shadowy woodlands. With these\nwere to be seen at intervals some of maturer years, full-blown flowers\namong the opening buds, with that conscious look upon their faces which\nso many women wear during the period when they never meet a single man\nwithout having his monosyllable ready for him,--tied as they are, poor\nthings! on the rock of expectation, each of them an Andromeda waiting\nfor her Perseus.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is that girl in ringlets,--the fourth in the third row on the\nright?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Master Langdon.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCharlotte Ann Wood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miss Darley; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwrites very pretty poems.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!--And the pink one, three seats from her? Looks bright; anything in\nher?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEmma Dean,--day-scholar,--Squire Dean's daughter,--nice girl,--second\nmedal last year.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe master asked these two questions in a careless kind of way, and did\nnot seem to pay any too much attention to the answers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd who and what is that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,--\u00e2\u0080\u009csitting a little apart\nthere,--that strange, wild-looking girl?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis time he put the real question he wanted answered;--the other two\nwere asked at random, as masks for the third.\n\nThe lady-teacher's face changed;--one would have said she was frightened\nor troubled. She looked at the girl doubtfully, as if she might hear the\nmaster's question and its answer. But the girl did not look up;--she was\nwinding a gold chain about her wrist, and then uncoiling it, as if in a\nkind of reverie.\n\nMiss Darley drew close to the master and placed her hand so as to hide\nher lips. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon't look at her as if we were talking about her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nwhispered softly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is Elsie Venner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. AN OLD-FASHIONED DESCRIPTIVE CHAPTER.\n\nIt was a comfort to get to a place with something like society, with\nresidences which had pretensions to elegance, with people of some\nbreeding, with a newspaper, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cstores\u00e2\u0080\u009d to advertise in it, and with\ntwo or three churches to keep each other alive by wholesome agitation.\nRockland was such a place.\n\nSome of the natural features of the town have been described already.\nThe Mountain, of course, was what gave it its character, and redeemed\nit from wearing the commonplace expression which belongs to ordinary\ncountry-villages. Beautiful, wild, invested with the mystery which\nbelongs to untrodden spaces, and with enough of terror to give it\ndignity, it had yet closer relations with the town over which it brooded\nthan the passing stranger knew of. Thus, it made a local climate\nby cutting off the northern winds and holding the sun's heat like a\ngarden-wall. Peachtrees, which, on the northern side of the mountain,\nhardly ever came to fruit, ripened abundant crops in Rockland.\n\nBut there was still another relation between the mountain and the town\nat its foot, which strangers were not likely to hear alluded to, and\nwhich was oftener thought of than spoken of by its inhabitants. Those\nhigh-impending forests,--\u00e2\u0080\u009changers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as White of Selborne would have\ncalled them,--sloping far upward and backward into the distance, had\nalways an air of menace blended with their wild beauty. It seemed as\nif some heaven-scaling Titan had thrown his shaggy robe over the bare,\nprecipitous flanks of the rocky summit, and it might at any moment slide\nlike a garment flung carelessly on the nearest chance-support, and, so\nsliding, crush the village out of being, as the Rossberg when it tumbled\nover on the valley of Goldau.\n\nPersons have been known to remove from the place, after a short\nresidence in it, because they were haunted day and night by the thought\nof this awful green wall, piled up into the air over their heads. They\nwould lie awake of nights, thinking they heard the muffed snapping of\nroots, as if a thousand acres of the mountain-side were tugging to break\naway, like the snow from a house-roof, and a hundred thousand trees were\nclinging with all their fibres to hold back the soil just ready to peel\naway and crash down with all its rocks and forest-growths. And yet, by\none of those strange contradictions we are constantly finding in human\nnature, there were natives of the town who would come back thirty or\nforty years after leaving it, just to nestle under this same threatening\nmountainside, as old men sun themselves against southward-facing walls.\nThe old dreams and legends of danger added to the attraction. If the\nmountain should ever slide, they had a kind of feeling as if they ought\nto be there. It was a fascination like that which the rattlesnake is\nsaid to exert.\n\nThis comparison naturally suggests the recollection of that other source\nof danger which was an element in the every-day life of the Rockland\npeople. The folks in some of the neighboring towns had a joke against\nthem, that a Rocklander could n't hear a beanpod rattle without saying,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Lord have mercy on us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is very true, that many a nervous old\nlady has had a terrible start, caused by some mischievous young rogue's\ngiving a sudden shake to one of these noisy vegetable products in her\nimmediate vicinity. Yet, strangely enough, many persons missed the\nexcitement of the possibility of a fatal bite in other regions,\nwhere there were nothing but black and green and striped snakes,\nmean ophidians, having the spite of the nobler serpent without his\nvenom,--poor crawling creatures, whom Nature would not trust with a\npoison-bag. Many natives of Rockland did unquestionably experience a\ncertain gratification in this infinitesimal sense of danger. It was\nnoted that the old people retained their hearing longer than in other\nplaces. Some said it was the softened climate, but others believed it\nwas owing to the habit of keeping their ears open whenever they were\nwalking through the grass or in the woods. At any rate, a slight sense\nof danger is often an agreeable stimulus. People sip their creme de\nnoyau with a peculiar tremulous pleasure, because there is a bare\npossibility that it may contain prussic acid enough to knock them over;\nin which case they will lie as dead as if a thunder-cloud had emptied\nitself into the earth through their brain and marrow.\n\nBut Rockland had other features which helped to give it a special\ncharacter. First of all, there was one grand street which was its chief\nglory. Elm Street it was called, naturally enough, for its elms made\na long, pointed-arched gallery of it through most of its extent. No\nnatural Gothic arch compares, for a moment, with that formed by two\nAmerican elms, where their lofty jets of foliage shoot across each\nother's ascending curves, to intermingle their showery flakes of green.\nWhen one looks through a long double row of these, as in that lovely\navenue which the poets of Yale remember so well,\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, could the vista of my life but now as bright appear\n     As when I first through Temple Street looked down thine espalier!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nhe beholds a temple not built with hands, fairer than any minster, with\nall its clustered stems and flowering capitals, that ever grew in stone.\n\nNobody knows New England who is not on terms of intimacy with one of\nits elms. The elm comes nearer to having a soul than any other vegetable\ncreature among us. It loves man as man loves it. It is modest and\npatient. It has a small flake of a seed which blows in everywhere and\nmakes arrangements for coming up by and by. So, in spring, one finds a\ncrop of baby-elms among his carrots and parsnips, very weak and small\ncompared to those succulent vegetables. The baby-elms die, most of them,\nslain, unrecognized or unheeded, by hand or hoe, as meekly as\nHerod's innocents. One of them gets overlooked, perhaps, until it has\nestablished a kind of right to stay. Three generations of carrot and\nparsnip consumers have passed away, yourself among them, and now let\nyour great-grandson look for the baby-elm. Twenty-two feet of clean\ngirth, three hundred and sixty feet in the line that bounds its leafy\ncircle, it covers the boy with such a canopy as neither glossy-leafed\noak nor insect-haunted linden ever lifted into the summer skies.\n\nElm Street was the pride of Rockland, but not only on account of its\nGothic-arched vista. In this street were most of the great houses, or\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cmansion-houses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as it was usual to call them. Along this street,\nalso, the more nicely kept and neatly painted dwellings were chiefly\ncongregated. It was the correct thing for a Rockland dignitary to have a\nhouse in Elm Street. A New England \u00e2\u0080\u009cmansion-house\u00e2\u0080\u009d is naturally square,\nwith dormer windows projecting from the roof, which has a balustrade\nwith turned posts round it. It shows a good breadth of front-yard\nbefore its door, as its owner shows a respectable expanse of a clean\nshirt-front. It has a lateral margin beyond its stables and offices, as\nits master wears his white wrist bands showing beyond his coat-cuffs.\nIt may not have what can properly be called grounds, but it must have\nelbow-room, at any rate. Without it, it is like a man who is always\ntight-buttoned for want of any linen to show. The mansion-house which\nhas had to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbutton itself up tight in fences, for want of green or\ngravel margin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d will be advertising for boarders presently. The old\nEnglish pattern of the New England mansion-house, only on a somewhat\ngrander scale, is Sir Thomas Abney's place, where dear, good Dr. Watts\nsaid prayers for the family, and wrote those blessed hymns of his that\nsing us into consciousness in our cradles, and come back to us in sweet,\nsingle verses, between the moments of wandering and of stupor, when we\nlie dying, and sound over us when we can no longer hear them, bringing\ngrateful tears to the hot, aching eyes beneath the thick, black veils,\nand carrying the holy calm with them which filled the good man's\nheart, as he prayed and sung under the shelter of the old English\nmansion-house. Next to the mansion-houses, came the two-story trim,\nwhite-painted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgenteel\u00e2\u0080\u009d houses, which, being more gossipy and less\nnicely bred, crowded close up to the street, instead of standing\nback from it with arms akimbo, like the mansion-houses. Their little\nfront-yards were very commonly full of lilac and syringa and other\nbushes, which were allowed to smother the lower story almost to the\nexclusion of light and airy so that, what with small windows and\nsmall windowpanes, and the darkness made by these choking growths of\nshrubbery, the front parlors of some of these houses were the most\ntomb-like, melancholy places that could be found anywhere among\nthe abodes of the living. Their garnishing was apt to assist this\nimpression. Large-patterned carpets, which always look discontented\nin little rooms, haircloth furniture, black and shiny as beetles' wing\ncases, and centre-tables, with a sullen oil-lamp of the kind called\nastral by our imaginative ancestors, in the centre,--these things\nwere inevitable. In set piles round the lamp was ranged the current\nliterature of the day, in the form of Temperance Documents, unbound\nnumbers of one of the Unknown Public's Magazines with worn-out steel\nengravings and high-colored fashion-plates, the Poems of a distinguished\nBritish author whom it is unnecessary to mention, a volume of sermons,\nor a novel or two, or both, according to the tastes of the family, and\nthe Good Book, which is always Itself in the cheapest and commonest\ncompany. The father of the family with his hand in the breast of his\ncoat, the mother of the same in a wide-bordered cap, sometimes a print\nof the Last Supper, by no means Morghen's, or the Father of his Country,\nor the old General, or the Defender of the Constitution, or an unknown\nclergyman with an open book before him,--these were the usual ornaments\nof the walls, the first two a matter of rigor, the others according to\npolitics and other tendencies.\n\nThis intermediate class of houses, wherever one finds them in New\nEngland towns, are very apt to be cheerless and unsatisfactory. They\nhave neither the luxury of the mansion-house nor the comfort of the\nfarm-house. They are rarely kept at an agreeable temperature. The\nmansion-house has large fireplaces and generous chimneys, and is open\nto the sunshine. The farm-house makes no pretensions, but it has a good\nwarm kitchen, at any rate, and one can be comfortable there with the\nrest of the family, without fear and without reproach. These lesser\ncountry-houses of genteel aspirations are much given to patent\nsubterfuges of one kind and another to get heat without combustion. The\nchilly parlor and the slippery hair-cloth seat take the life out of the\nwarmest welcome. If one would make these places wholesome, happy, and\ncheerful, the first precept would be,--The dearest fuel, plenty of it,\nand let half the heat go up the chimney. If you can't afford this, don't\ntry to live in a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgenteel\u00e2\u0080\u009d fashion, but stick to the ways of the honest\nfarm-house.\n\nThere were a good many comfortable farm-houses scattered about Rockland.\nThe best of them were something of the following pattern, which is too\noften superseded of late by a more pretentious, but infinitely less\npleasing kind of rustic architecture. A little back from the road,\nseated directly on the green sod, rose a plain wooden building, two\nstories in front, with a long roof sloping backwards to within a few\nfeet of the ground. This, like the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmansion-house,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is copied from an\nold English pattern. Cottages of this model may be seen in Lancashire,\nfor instance, always with the same honest, homely look, as if their\nroofs acknowledged their relationship to the soil out of which they\nsprung. The walls were unpainted, but turned by the slow action of sun\nand air and rain to a quiet dove or slate color. An old broken millstone\nat the door,--a well-sweep pointing like a finger to the heavens, which\nthe shining round of water beneath looked up at like a dark unsleeping\neye,--a single large elm a little at one side,--a barn twice as big as\nthe house,--a cattle-yard, with\n\n     \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe white horns tossing above the wall,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\nsome fields, in pasture or in crops, with low stone walls round them,--a\nrow of beehives,--a garden-patch, with roots, and currant-bushes,\nand many-hued hollyhocks, and swollen-stemmed, globe-headed, seedling\nonions, and marigolds and flower-de-luces, and lady's-delights, and\npeonies, crowding in together, with southernwood in the borders,\nand woodbine and hops and morning-glories climbing as they got a\nchance,--these were the features by which the Rockland-born children\nremembered the farm-house, when they had grown to be men. Such are the\nrecollections that come over poor sailor-boys crawling out on reeling\nyards to reef topsails as their vessels stagger round the stormy Cape;\nand such are the flitting images that make the eyes of old country-born\nmerchants look dim and dreamy, as they sit in their city palaces, warm\nwith the after-dinner flush of the red wave out of which Memory arises,\nas Aphrodite arose from the green waves of the ocean.\n\nTwo meeting-houses stood on two eminences, facing each other, and\nlooking like a couple of fighting-cocks with their necks straight up in\nthe air,--as if they would flap their roofs, the next thing, and crow\nout of their upstretched steeples, and peck at each other's glass eyes\nwith their sharp-pointed weathercocks.\n\nThe first was a good pattern of the real old-fashioned New England\nmeeting-house. It was a large barn with windows, fronted by a square\ntower crowned with a kind of wooden bell inverted and raised on legs,\nout of which rose a slender spire with the sharp-billed weathercock at\nits summit. Inside, tall, square pews with flapping seats, and a gallery\nrunning round three sides of the building. On the fourth side the\npulpit, with a huge, dusty sounding-board hanging over it. Here preached\nthe Reverend Pierrepont Honeywood, D. D., successor, after a number of\ngenerations, to the office and the parsonage of the Reverend Didymus\nBean, before mentioned, but not suspected of any of his alleged\nheresies. He held to the old faith of the Puritans, and occasionally\ndelivered a discourse which was considered by the hard-headed\ntheologians of his parish to have settled the whole matter fully and\nfinally, so that now there was a good logical basis laid down for\nthe Millennium, which might begin at once upon the platform of his\ndemonstrations. Yet the Reverend Dr. Honeywood was fonder of preaching\nplain, practical sermons about the duties of life, and showing his\nChristianity in abundant good works among his people. It was noticed by\nsome few of his flock, not without comment, that the great majority of\nhis texts came from the Gospels, and this more and more as he became\ninterested in various benevolent enterprises which brought him into\nrelations with-ministers and kindhearted laymen of other denominations.\nHe was in fact a man of a very warm, open, and exceedingly human\ndisposition, and, although bred by a clerical father, whose motto was\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSit anima mea cum Puritanis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exercised his human faculties in the\nharness of his ancient faith with such freedom that the straps of it got\nso loose they did not interfere greatly with the circulation of the\nwarm blood through his system. Once in a while he seemed to think it\nnecessary to come out with a grand doctrinal sermon, and them he would\nlapse away for a while into preaching on men's duties to each other and\nto society, and hit hard, perhaps, at some of the actual vices of the\ntime and place, and insist with such tenderness and eloquence on the\ngreat depth and breadth of true Christian love and charity, that his\noldest deacon shook his head, and wished he had shown as much interest\nwhen he was preaching, three Sabbaths back, on Predestination, or in\nhis discourse against the Sabellians. But he was sound in the faith;\nno doubt of that. Did he not preside at the council held in the town\nof Tamarack, on the other side of the mountain, which expelled its\nclergyman for maintaining heretical doctrines? As presiding officer, he\ndid not vote, of course, but there was no doubt that he was all right;\nhe had some of the Edwards blood in him, and that couldn't very well let\nhim go wrong.\n\nThe meeting-house on the other and opposite summit was of a more modern\nstyle, considered by many a great improvement on the old New England\nmodel, so that it is not uncommon for a country parish to pull down its\nold meeting-house, which has been preached in for a hundred years or so,\nand put up one of these more elegant edifices. The new building was in\nwhat may be called the florid shingle-Gothic manner. Its pinnacles and\ncrockets and other ornaments were, like the body of the building, all of\npine wood,--an admirable material, as it is very soft and easily worked,\nand can be painted of any color desired. Inside, the walls were stuccoed\nin imitation of stone,--first a dark brown square, then two light brown\nsquares, then another dark brown square, and so on, to represent the\naccidental differences of shade always noticeable in the real stones of\nwhich walls are built. To be sure, the architect could not help getting\nhis party-colored squares in almost as regular rhythmical order as those\nof a chess-board; but nobody can avoid doing things in a systematic and\nserial way; indeed, people who wish to plant trees in natural chimps\nknow very well that they cannot keep from making regular lines and\nsymmetrical figures, unless by some trick or other, as that one of\nthrowing a peck of potatoes up into the air and sticking in a tree\nwherever a potato happens to fall. The pews of this meeting-house were\nthe usual oblong ones, where people sit close together, with a ledge\nbefore them to support their hymn-books, liable only to occasional\ncontact with the back of the next pew's heads or bonnets, and a\nplace running under the seat of that pew where hats could be\ndeposited,--always at the risk of the owner, in case of injury by boots\nor crickets.\n\nIn this meeting-house preached the Reverend Chauncy Fairweather, a\ndivine of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cLiberal\u00e2\u0080\u009d school, as it is commonly called, bred at that\nfamous college which used to be thought, twenty or thirty years ago, to\nhave the monopoly of training young men in the milder forms of heresy.\nHis ministrations were attended with decency, but not followed with\nenthusiasm. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe beauty of virtue\u00e2\u0080\u009d got to be an old story at last.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe moral dignity of human nature\u00e2\u0080\u009d ceased to excite a thrill of\nsatisfaction, after some hundred repetitions. It grew to be a dull\nbusiness, this preaching against stealing and intemperance, while he\nknew very well that the thieves were prowling round orchards and\nempty houses, instead of being there to hear the sermon, and that the\ndrunkards, being rarely church-goers, get little good by the statistics\nand eloquent appeals of the preacher. Every now and then, however,\nthe Reverend Mr. Fairweather let off a polemic discourse against his\nneighbor opposite, which waked his people up a little; but it was a\nlanguid congregation, at best,--very apt to stay away from meeting\nin the afternoon, and not at all given to extra evening services.\nThe minister, unlike his rival of the other side of the way, was a\ndown-hearted and timid kind of man. He went on preaching as he had been\ntaught to preach, but he had misgivings at times. There was a little\nRoman Catholic church at the foot of the hill where his own was placed,\nwhich he always had to pass on Sundays. He could never look on\nthe thronging multitudes that crowded its pews and aisles or knelt\nbare-headed on its steps, without a longing to get in among them and\ngo down on his knees and enjoy that luxury of devotional contact which\nmakes a worshipping throng as different from the same numbers praying\napart as a bed of coals is from a trail of scattered cinders.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, if I could but huddle in with those poor laborers and\nworking-women!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would say to himself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I could but breathe that\natmosphere, stifling though it be, yet made holy by ancient litanies,\nand cloudy with the smoke of hallowed incense, for one hour, instead of\ndroning over these moral precepts to my half-sleeping congregation!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The\nintellectual isolation of his sect preyed upon him; for, of all\nterrible things to natures like his, the most terrible is to belong to a\nminority. No person that looked at his thin and sallow cheek, his sunken\nand sad eye, his tremulous lip, his contracted forehead, or who heard\nhis querulous, though not unmusical voice, could fail to see that his\nlife was an uneasy one, that he was engaged in some inward conflict. His\ndark, melancholic aspect contrasted with his seemingly cheerful creed,\nand was all the more striking, as the worthy Dr. Honeywood, professing a\nbelief which made him a passenger on board a shipwrecked planet, was\nyet a most good-humored and companionable gentleman, whose laugh on\nweek-days did one as much good to listen to as the best sermon he ever\ndelivered on a Sunday.\n\nA mile or two from the centre of Rockland was a pretty little Episcopal\nchurch, with a roof like a wedge of cheese, a square tower, a stained\nwindow, and a trained rector, who read the service with such ventral\ndepth of utterance and rrreduplication of the rrresonant letter, that\nhis own mother would not have known him for her son, if the good woman\nhad not ironed his surplice and put it on with her own hands.\n\nThere were two public-houses in the place: one dignified with the name\nof the Mountain House, somewhat frequented by city people in the summer\nmonths, large-fronted, three-storied, balconied, boasting a distinct\nladies'-drawing-room, and spreading a table d'hote of some pretensions;\nthe other, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPollard's Tahvern,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the common speech,--a two-story\nbuilding, with a bar-room, once famous, where there was a great smell of\nhay and boots and pipes and all other bucolic-flavored elements,--where\ngames of checkers were played on the back of the bellows with red and\nwhite kernels of corn, or with beans and coffee, where a man slept in a\nbox-settle at night, to wake up early passengers,--where teamsters came\nin, with wooden-handled whips and coarse frocks, reinforcing the bucolic\nflavor of the atmosphere, and middle-aged male gossips, sometimes\nincluding the squire of the neighboring law-office, gathered to exchange\na question or two about the news, and then fall into that solemn state\nof suspended animation which the temperance bar-rooms of modern days\nproduce in human beings, as the Grotta del Cane does in dogs in the\nwell-known experiments related by travellers. This bar-room used to be\nfamous for drinking and storytelling, and sometimes fighting, in old\ntimes. That was when there were rows of decanters on the shelf behind\nthe bar, and a hissing vessel of hot water ready, to make punch, and\nthree or four loggerheads (long irons clubbed at the end) were always\nlying in the fire in the cold season, waiting to be plunged into\nsputtering and foaming mugs of flip,--a goodly compound; speaking\naccording to the flesh, made with beer and sugar, and a certain\nsuspicion of strong waters, over which a little nutmeg being grated,\nand in it the hot iron being then allowed to sizzle, there results a\npeculiar singed aroma, which the wise regard as a warning to remove\nthemselves at once out of the reach of temptation.\n\nBut the bar of Pollard's Tahvern no longer presented its old\nattractions, and the loggerheads had long disappeared from the fire. In\nplace of the decanters, were boxes containing \u00e2\u0080\u009clozengers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as they were\ncommonly called, sticks of candy in jars, cigars in tumblers, a few\nlemons, grown hard-skinned and marvellously shrunken by long exposure,\nbut still feebly suggestive of possible lemonade,--the whole ornamented\nby festoons of yellow and blue cut flypaper. On the front shelf of the\nbar stood a large German-silver pitcher of water, and scattered about\nwere ill-conditioned lamps, with wicks that always wanted picking, which\nburned red and smoked a good deal, and were apt to go out without any\nobvious cause, leaving strong reminiscences of the whale-fishery in the\ncircumambient air.\n\nThe common schoolhouses of Rockland were dwarfed by the grandeur of the\nApollinean Institute. The master passed one of them, in a walk he was\ntaking, soon after his arrival at Rockland. He looked in at the rows of\ndesks, and recalled his late experiences. He could not help laughing, as\nhe thought how neatly he had knocked the young butcher off his pins.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA little science is a dangerous thing, 'as well as a little\n'learning,'\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to himself; \u00e2\u0080\u009conly it's dangerous to the fellow you'\ntry it on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he cut him a good stick, and began climbing the side of\nThe Mountain to get a look at that famous Rattlesnake Ledge.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. THE SUNBEAM AND THE SHADOW.\n\nThe virtue of the world is not mainly in its leaders. In the midst of\nthe multitude which follows there is often something better than in the\none that goes before. Old generals wanted to take Toulon, but one of\ntheir young colonels showed them how. The junior counsel has been known\nnot unfrequently to make a better argument than his senior fellow,--if,\nindeed, he did not make both their arguments. Good ministers will tell\nyou they have parishioners who beat them in the practice of the virtues.\nA great establishment, got up on commercial principles, like the\nApollinean Institute, might yet be well carried on, if it happened to\nget good teachers. And when Master Langdon came to see its management,\nhe recognized that there must be fidelity and intelligence somewhere\namong the instructors. It was only necessary to look for a moment at\nthe fair, open forehead, the still, tranquil eye of gentle, habitual\nauthority, the sweet gravity that lay upon the lips, to hear the clear\nanswers to the pupils' questions, to notice how every request had the\nforce without the form of a command, and the young man could not doubt\nthat the good genius of the school stood before him in the person of\nHelen barley.\n\nIt was the old story. A poor country-clergyman dies, and leaves a widow\nand a daughter. In Old England the daughter would have eaten the bitter\nbread of a governess in some rich family. In New England she must keep\na school. So, rising from one sphere to another, she at length finds\nherself the prima donna in the department of instruction in Mr. Silas\nPeckham's educational establishment.\n\nWhat a miserable thing it is to be poor. She was dependent, frail,\nsensitive, conscientious. She was in the power of a hard, grasping,\nthin-blooded, tough-fibred, trading educator, who neither knew nor cared\nfor a tender woman's sensibilities, but who paid her and meant to have\nhis money's worth out of her brains, and as much more than his\nmoney's worth as he could get. She was consequently, in plain English,\noverworked, and an overworked woman is always a sad sight,--sadder a\ngreat deal than an overworked man, because she is so much more fertile\nin capacities of suffering than a man. She has so many varieties of\nheadache,--sometimes as if Jael were driving the nail that killed Sisera\ninto her temples,--sometimes letting her work with half her brain while\nthe other half throbs as if it would go to pieces,--sometimes tightening\nround the brows as if her cap-band were a ring of iron,--and then her\nneuralgias, and her backaches, and her fits of depression, in which she\nthinks she is nothing and less than nothing, and those paroxysms which\nmen speak slightingly of as hysterical,--convulsions, that is all, only\nnot commonly fatal ones,--so many trials which belong to her fine and\nmobile structure,--that she is always entitled to pity, when she is\nplaced in conditions which develop her nervous tendencies.\n\nThe poor young lady's work had, of course, been doubled since the\ndeparture of Master Langdon's predecessor. Nobody knows what the\nweariness of instruction is, as soon as the teacher's faculties begin to\nbe overtasked, but those who have tried it. The relays of fresh pupils,\neach new set with its exhausting powers in full action, coming one after\nanother, take out all the reserved forces and faculties of resistance\nfrom the subject of their draining process.\n\nThe day's work was over, and it was late in the evening, when she\nsat down, tired and faint, with a great bundle of girls' themes or\ncompositions to read over before she could rest her weary head on the\npillow of her narrow trundle-bed, and forget for a while the treadmill\nstair of labor she was daily climbing.\n\nHow she dreaded this most forlorn of all a teacher's tasks! She\nwas conscientious in her duties, and would insist on reading every\nsentence,--there was no saying where she might find faults of grammar or\nbad spelling. There might have been twenty or thirty of these themes\nin the bundle before her. Of course she knew pretty well the leading\nsentiments they could contain: that beauty was subject to the accidents\nof time; that wealth was inconstant, and existence uncertain; that\nvirtue was its own reward; that youth exhaled, like the dewdrop from the\nflower, ere the sun had reached its meridian; that life was o'ershadowed\nwith trials; that the lessons of virtue instilled by our beloved\nteachers were to be our guides through all our future career. The\nimagery employed consisted principally of roses, lilies, birds, clouds,\nand brooks, with the celebrated comparison of wayward genius to\nmeteor. Who does not know the small, slanted, Italian hand of\nthese girls'-compositions, their stringing together of the good old\ntraditional copy-book phrases; their occasional gushes of sentiment,\ntheir profound estimates of the world, sounding to the old folks that\nread them as the experience of a bantam pullet's last-hatched young one\nwith the chips of its shell on its head would sound to a Mother Cary's\nchicken, who knew the great ocean with all its typhoons and tornadoes?\nYet every now and then one is liable to be surprised with strange\nclairvoyant flashes, that can hardly be explained, except by the\nmysterious inspiration which every now and then seizes a young girl and\nexalts her intelligence, just as hysteria in other instances exalts the\nsensibility,--a little something of that which made Joan of Arc, and the\nBurney girl who prophesied \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvelina,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the Davidson sisters. In the\nmidst of these commonplace exercises which Miss Darley read over so\ncarefully were two or three that had something of individual flavor\nabout them, and here and there there was an image or an epithet which\nshowed the footprint of a passionate nature, as a fallen scarlet feather\nmarks the path the wild flamingo has trodden.\n\nThe young lady-teacher read them with a certain indifference of manner,\nas one reads proofs--noting defects of detail, but not commonly\narrested by the matters treated of. Even Miss Charlotte Ann Wood's poem,\nbeginning--\n\n          \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow sweet at evening's balmy hour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\ndid not excite her. She marked the inevitable false rhyme of Cockney and\nYankee beginners, morn and dawn, and tossed the verses on the pile of\npapers she had finished. She was looking over some of the last of them\nin a rather listless way,--for the poor thing was getting sleepy in\nspite of herself,--when she came to one which seemed to rouse her\nattention, and lifted her drooping lids. She looked at it a moment\nbefore she would touch it. Then she took hold of it by one corner and\nslid it off from the rest. One would have said she was afraid of it,\nor had some undefined antipathy which made it hateful to her. Such odd\nfancies are common enough in young persons in her nervous state. Many of\nthese young people will jump up twenty times a day and run to dabble\nthe tips of their fingers in water, after touching the most inoffensive\nobjects.\n\nThis composition was written in a singular, sharp-pointed, long, slender\nhand, on a kind of wavy, ribbed paper. There was something strangely\nsuggestive about the look of it, but exactly of what, Miss barley either\ncould not or did not try to think. The subject of the paper was The\nMountain,--the composition being a sort of descriptive rhapsody. It\nshowed a startling familiarity with some of the savage scenery of the\nregion. One would have said that the writer must have threaded its\nwildest solitudes by the light of the moon and stars as well as by\nday. As the teacher read on, her color changed, and a kind of tremulous\nagitation came over her. There were hints in this strange paper she did\nnot know what to make of. There was something in its descriptions and\nimagery that recalled,--Miss Darley could not say what,--but it made her\nfrightfully nervous. Still she could not help reading, till she came\nto one passage which so agitated her, that the tired and over-wearied\ngirl's self-control left her entirely. She sobbed once or twice, then\nlaughed convulsively; and flung herself on the bed, where she worked out\na set hysteric spasm as she best might, without anybody to rub her hands\nand see that she did not hurt herself.\n\nBy and by she got quiet, rose and went to her bookcase, took down a\nvolume of Coleridge, and read a short time, and so to bed, to sleep and\nwake from time to time with a sudden start out of uneasy dreams.\n\nPerhaps it is of no great consequence what it was in the composition\nwhich set her off into this nervous paroxysm. She was in such a state\nthat almost any slight agitation would have brought on the attack, and\nit was the accident of her transient excitability, very probably, which\nmade a trifling cause the seeming occasion of so much disturbance. The\ntheme was signed, in the same peculiar, sharp, slender hand, E. Venner,\nand was, of course, written by that wild-looking girl who had excited\nthe master's curiosity and prompted his question, as before mentioned.\nThe next morning the lady-teacher looked pale and wearied, naturally\nenough, but she was in her place at the usual hour, and Master Langdon\nin his own.\n\nThe girls had not yet entered the school room.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have been ill, I am afraid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Bernard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was not well yesterday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she, answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had a worry and a kind of\nfright. It is so dreadful to have the charge of all these young souls\nand bodies. Every young girl ought to walk locked close, arm in arm,\nbetween two guardian angels. Sometimes I faint almost with the thought\nof all that I ought to do, and of my own weakness and wants.--Tell me,\nare there not natures born so out of parallel with the lines of natural\nlaw that nothing short of a miracle can bring them right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Bernard had speculated somewhat, as all thoughtful persons of his\nprofession are forced to do, on the innate organic tendencies with which\nindividuals, families, and races are born. He replied, therefore, with\na smile, as one to whom the question suggested a very familiar class of\nfacts.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, of course. Each of us is only the footing-up of a double column of\nfigures that goes back to the first pair. Every unit tells,--and some of\nthem are plus, and some minus. If the columns don't add up right, it is\ncommonly because we can't make out all the figures. I don't mean to say\nthat something may not be added by Nature to make up for losses and keep\nthe race to its average, but we are mainly nothing but the answer to\na long sum in addition and subtraction. No doubt there are people born\nwith impulses at every possible angle to the parallels of Nature, as you\ncall them. If they happen to cut these at right angles, of course they\nare beyond the reach of common influences. Slight obliquities are what\nwe have most to do with in education. Penitentiaries and insane asylums\ntake care of most of the right-angle cases.--I am afraid I have put it\ntoo much like a professor, and I am only a student, you know. Pray, what\nset you to asking me this? Any strange cases among the scholars?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe meek teacher's blue eyes met the luminous glance that came with the\nquestion. She, too, was of gentle blood,--not meaning by that that she\nwas of any noted lineage, but that she came of a cultivated stock, never\nrich, but long trained to intellectual callings. A thousand decencies,\namenities, reticences, graces, which no one thinks of until he misses\nthem, are the traditional right of those who spring from such families.\nAnd when two persons of this exceptional breeding meet in the midst\nof the common multitude, they seek each other's company at once by the\nnatural law of elective affinity. It is wonderful how men and women know\ntheir peers. If two stranger queens, sole survivors of two shipwrecked\nvessels, were cast, half-naked, on a rock together, each would at once\naddress the other as \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur Royal Sister.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelen Darley looked into the dark eyes of Bernard Langdon glittering\nwith the light which flashed from them with his question. Not as those\nfoolish, innocent country-girls of the small village did she look into\nthem, to be fascinated and bewildered, but to sound them with a calm,\nsteadfast purpose. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA gentleman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said to herself, as she read his\nexpression and his features with a woman's rapid, but exhausting glance.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to himself, as he met her questioning look,--so brief,\nso quiet, yet so assured, as of one whom necessity had taught to read\nfaces quickly without offence, as children read the faces of parents,\nas wives read the faces of hard-souled husbands. All this was but a few\nseconds' work, and yet the main point was settled. If there had been any\nvulgar curiosity or coarseness of any kind lurking in his expression,\nshe would have detected it. If she had not lifted her eyes to his face\nso softly and kept them there so calmly and withdrawn them so quietly,\nhe would not have said to himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is a LADY,\u00e2\u0080\u009d for that word\nmeant a good deal to the descendant of the courtly Wentworths and the\nscholarly Langdons.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are strange people everywhere, Mr. Langdon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I\ndon't think our schoolroom is an exception. I am glad you believe in the\nforce of transmitted tendencies. It would break my heart, if I did not\nthink that there are faults beyond the reach of everything but God's\nspecial grace. I should die, if I thought that my negligence or\nincapacity was alone responsible for the errors and sins of those I have\ncharge of. Yet there are mysteries I do not know how to account for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n She looked all round the schoolroom, and then said, in a whisper, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr.\nLangdon, we had a girl that stole, in the school, not long ago. Worse\nthan that, we had a girl who tried to set us on fire. Children of good\npeople, both of them. And we have a girl now that frightens me so\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\nThe door opened, and three misses came in to take their seats: three\ntypes, as it happened, of certain classes, into which it would not have\nbeen difficult to distribute the greater number of the girls in\nthe school.--Hannah Martin. Fourteen years and three months old.\nShort-necked, thick-waisted, round-cheeked, smooth, vacant forehead,\nlarge, dull eyes. Looks good-natured, with little other expression.\nThree buns in her bag, and a large apple. Has a habit of attacking her\nprovisions in school-hours.--Rosa Milburn. Sixteen. Brunette, with\na rare-ripe flush in her cheeks. Color comes and goes easily. Eyes\nwandering, apt to be downcast. Moody at times. Said to be passionate,\nif irritated. Finished in high relief. Carries shoulders well back\nand walks well, as if proud of her woman's life, with a slight rocking\nmovement, being one of the wide-flanged pattern, but seems restless,--a\nhard girl to look after. Has a romance in her pocket, which she means\nto read in school-time.--Charlotte Ann Wood. Fifteen. The poetess before\nmentioned. Long, light ringlets, pallid complexion, blue eyes. Delicate\nchild, half unfolded. Gentle, but languid and despondent. Does not go\nmuch with the other girls, but reads a good deal, especially poetry,\nunderscoring favorite passages. Writes a great many verses, very fast,\nnot very correctly; full of the usual human sentiments, expressed in\nthe accustomed phrases. Under-vitalized. Sensibilities not covered with\ntheir normal integuments. A negative condition, often confounded with\ngenius, and sometimes running into it. Young people who fall out of line\nthrough weakness of the active faculties are often confounded with those\nwho step out of it through strength of the intellectual ones.\n\nThe girls kept coming in, one after another, or in pairs or groups,\nuntil the schoolroom was nearly full. Then there was a little pause, and\na light step was heard in the passage. The lady-teacher's eyes turned to\nthe door, and the master's followed them in the same direction.\n\nA girl of about seventeen entered. She was tall and slender, but\nrounded, with a peculiar undulation of movement, such as one sometimes\nsees in perfectly untutored country-girls, whom Nature, the queen of\ngraces, has taken in hand, but more commonly in connection with the\nvery highest breeding of the most thoroughly trained society. She was\na splendid scowling beauty, black-browed, with a flash of white teeth\nwhich was always like a surprise when her lips parted. She wore a\ncheckered dress, of a curious pattern, and a camel's-hair scarf twisted\na little fantastically about her. She went to her seat, which she had\nmoved a short distance apart from the rest, and, sitting down, began\nplaying listlessly with her gold chain, as was a common habit with her,\ncoiling it and uncoiling it about her slender wrist, and braiding it\nin with her long, delicate fingers. Presently she looked up. Black,\npiercing eyes, not large,--a low forehead, as low as that of Clytie in\nthe Townley bust,--black hair, twisted in heavy braids,--a face that one\ncould not help looking at for its beauty, yet that one wanted to look\naway from for something in its expression, and could not for those\ndiamond eyes. They were fixed on the lady-teacher now. The latter turned\nher own away, and let them wander over the other scholars. But they\ncould not help coming back again for a single glance at the wild beauty.\nThe diamond eyes were on her still. She turned the leaves of several of\nher books, as if in search of some passage, and, when she thought she\nhad waited long enough to be safe, once more stole a quick look at the\ndark girl. The diamond eyes were still upon her. She put her kerchief\nto her forehead, which had grown slightly moist; she sighed once, almost\nshivered, for she felt cold; then, following some ill-defined impulse,\nwhich she could not resist, she left her place and went to the young\ngirl's desk.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you want of me, Elsie Venner?\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was a strange question to\nput, for the girl had not signified that she wished the teacher to come\nto her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought I could make you come.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The girl\nspoke in a low tone, a kind of half-whisper. She did not lisp, yet her\narticulation of one or two consonants was not absolutely perfect.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere did you get that flower, Elsie?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miss Darley. It was a rare\nalpine flower, which was found only in one spot among the rocks of The\nMountain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere it grew,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Elsie Veneer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTake it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The teacher could not\nrefuse her. The girl's finger tips touched hers as she took it. How cold\nthey were for a girl of such an organization!\n\nThe teacher went back to her seat. She made an excuse for quitting the\nschoolroom soon afterwards. The first thing she did was to fling the\nflower into her fireplace and rake the ashes over it. The second was to\nwash the tips of her fingers, as if she had been another Lady Macbeth. A\npoor, over-tasked, nervous creature,--we must not think too much of her\nfancies.\n\nAfter school was done, she finished the talk with the master which had\nbeen so suddenly interrupted. There were things spoken of which may\nprove interesting by and by, but there are other matters we must first\nattend to.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. THE EVENT OF THE SEASON.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. and Mrs. Colonel Sprowle's compliments to Mr. Langdon and requests\nthe pleasure of his company at a social entertainment on Wednesday\nevening next.\n\n         \u00e2\u0080\u009cElm St. Monday.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOn paper of a pinkish color and musky smell, with a large \u00e2\u0080\u009cS\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the\ntop, and an embossed border. Envelop adherent, not sealed. Addressed\n\n          LANGDON ESQ.\n          Present.\n\nBrought by H. Frederic Sprowle, youngest son of the Colonel,--the H. of\ncourse standing for the paternal Hezekiah, put in to please the father,\nand reduced to its initial to please the mother, she having a marked\npreference for Frederic. Boy directed to wait for an answer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Langdon has the pleasure of accepting Mr. and Mrs. Colonel\nSprowle's polite invitation for Wednesday evening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOn plain paper, sealed with an initial.\n\nIn walking along the main street, Mr. Bernard had noticed a large house\nof some pretensions to architectural display, namely, unnecessarily\nprojecting eaves, giving it a mushroomy aspect, wooden mouldings at\nvarious available points, and a grandiose arched portico. It looked a\nlittle swaggering by the side of one or two of the mansion-houses that\nwere not far from it, was painted too bright for Mr. Bernard's taste,\nhad rather too fanciful a fence before it, and had some fruit-trees\nplanted in the front-yard, which to this fastidious young gentleman\nimplied a defective sense of the fitness of things, not promising\nin people who lived in so large a house, with a mushroom roof and a\ntriumphal arch for its entrance.\n\nThis place was known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cColonel Sprowle's villa,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (genteel\nfriends,)--as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe elegant residence of our distinguished\nfellow-citizen, Colonel Sprowle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Rockland Weekly Universe,)--as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe\nneew haouse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (old settlers,)--as \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpraowle's Folly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (disaffected\nand possibly envious neighbors,)--and in common discourse, as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe\nColonel's.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHezekiah Sprowle, Esquire, Colonel Sprowle of the Commonwealth's\nMilitia, was a retired \u00e2\u0080\u009cmerchant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d An India merchant he might, perhaps,\nhave been properly called; for he used to deal in West India goods, such\nas coffee, sugar, and molasses, not to speak of rum,--also in tea, salt\nfish, butter and cheese, oil and candles, dried fruit, agricultural\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cp'doose\u00e2\u0080\u009d generally, industrial products, such as boots and shoes,\nand various kinds of iron and wooden ware, and at one end of the\nestablishment in calicoes and other stuffs,--to say nothing of\nmiscellaneous objects of the most varied nature, from sticks of candy,\nwhich tempted in the smaller youth with coppers in their fists, up to\nornamental articles of apparel, pocket-books, breast-pins, gilt-edged\nBibles, stationery, in short, everything which was like to prove\nseductive to the rural population. The Colonel had made money in trade,\nand also by matrimony. He had married Sarah, daughter and heiress of the\nlate Tekel Jordan, Esq., an old miser, who gave the town-clock, which\ncarries his name to posterity in large gilt letters as a generous\nbenefactor of his native place. In due time the Colonel reaped the\nreward of well-placed affections. When his wife's inheritance fell in,\nhe thought he had money enough to give up trade, and therefore sold out\nhis \u00e2\u0080\u009cstore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d called in some dialects of the English language shop, and\nhis business.\n\nLife became pretty hard work to him, of course, as soon as he had\nnothing particular to do. Country people with money enough not to have\nto work are in much more danger than city people in the same condition.\nThey get a specific look and character, which are the same in all the\nvillages where one studies them. They very commonly fall into a routine,\nthe basis of which is going to some lounging-place or other, a bar-room,\na reading-room, or something of the kind. They grow slovenly in dress,\nand wear the same hat forever. They have a feeble curiosity for news\nperhaps, which they take daily as a man takes his bitters, and then fall\nsilent and think they are thinking. But the mind goes out under this\nregimen, like a fire without a draught; and it is not very strange,\nif the instinct of mental self-preservation drives them to\nbrandy-and-water, which makes the hoarse whisper of memory musical for\na few brief moments, and puts a weak leer of promise on the features of\nthe hollow-eyed future. The Colonel was kept pretty well in hand as yet\nby his wife, and though it had happened to him once or twice to come\nhome rather late at night with a curious tendency to say the same\nthing twice and even three times over, it had always been in very cold\nweather,--and everybody knows that no one is safe to drink a couple of\nglasses of wine in a warm room and go suddenly out into the cold air.\n\nMiss Matilda Sprowle, sole daughter of the house, had reached the age at\nwhich young ladies are supposed in technical language to have come out,\nand thereafter are considered to be in company.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere's one piece o' goods,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Colonel to his wife, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat we\nha'n't disposed of, nor got a customer for yet. That 's Matildy. I\ndon't mean to set HER up at vaandoo. I guess she can have her pick of a\ndozen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe 's never seen anybody yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Sprowle, who had had a\ncertain project for some time, but had kept quiet about it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet's have\na party, and give her a chance to show herself and see some of the young\nfolks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Colonel was not very clear-headed, and he thought, naturally enough,\nthat the party was his own suggestion, because his remark led to the\nfirst starting of the idea. He entered into the plan, therefore, with a\nfeeling of pride as well as pleasure, and the great project was resolved\nupon in a family council without a dissentient voice. This was the\nparty, then, to which Mr. Bernard was going. The town had been full\nof it for a week. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEverybody was asked.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So everybody said that was\ninvited. But how in respect of those who were not asked? If it had been\none of the old mansion-houses that was giving a party, the boundary\nbetween the favored and the slighted families would have been known\npretty well beforehand, and there would have been no great amount of\ngrumbling. But the Colonel, for all his title, had a forest of poor\nrelations and a brushwood swamp of shabby friends, for he had scrambled\nup to fortune, and now the time was come when he must define his new\nsocial position.\n\nThis is always an awkward business in town or country. An exclusive\nalliance between two powers is often the same thing as a declaration of\nwar against a third. Rockland was soon split into a triumphant minority,\ninvited to Mrs. Sprowle's party, and a great majority, uninvited,\nof which the fraction just on the border line between recognized\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cgentility\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the level of the ungloved masses was in an active state\nof excitement and indignation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is she, I should like to know?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Saymore, the tailor's\nwife. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was plenty of folks in Rockland as good as ever Sally\nJordan was, if she had managed to pick up a merchant. Other folks could\nhave married merchants, if their families was n't as wealthy as them\nold skinflints that willed her their money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d etc., etc. Mrs. Saymore\nexpressed the feeling of many beside herself. She had, however, a\nspecial right to be proud of the name she bore. Her husband was own\ncousin to the Saymores of Freestone Avenue (who write the name Seymour,\nand claim to be of the Duke of Somerset's family, showing a clear\ndescent from the Protector to Edward Seymour, (1630,)--then a jump that\nwould break a herald's neck to one Seth Saymore,(1783,)--from whom to\nthe head of the present family the line is clear again). Mrs. Saymore,\nthe tailor's wife, was not invited, because her husband mended clothes.\nIf he had confined himself strictly to making them, it would have put a\ndifferent face upon the matter.\n\nThe landlord of the Mountain House and his lady were invited to Mrs.\nSprowle's party. Not so the landlord of Pollard's Tahvern and his lady.\nWhereupon the latter vowed that they would have a party at their house\ntoo, and made arrangements for a dance of twenty or thirty couples, to\nbe followed by an entertainment. Tickets to this \u00e2\u0080\u009cSocial Ball\u00e2\u0080\u009d were soon\ncirculated, and, being accessible to all at a moderate price, admission\nto the \u00e2\u0080\u009cElegant Supper\u00e2\u0080\u009d included, this second festival promised to be as\nmerry, if not as select, as the great party.\n\nWednesday came. Such doings had never been heard of in Rockland as went\non that day at the \u00e2\u0080\u009cvilla.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The carpet had been taken up in the long\nroom, so that the young folks might have a dance. Miss Matilda's piano\nhad been moved in, and two fiddlers and a clarionet-player engaged to\nmake music. All kinds of lamps had been put in requisition, and even\ncolored wax-candles figured on the mantel-pieces. The costumes of the\nfamily had been tried on the day before: the Colonel's black suit fitted\nexceedingly well; his lady's velvet dress displayed her contours to\nadvantage; Miss Matilda's flowered silk was considered superb; the\neldest son of the family, Mr. T. Jordan Sprowle, called affectionately\nand elegantly \u00e2\u0080\u009cGeordie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d voted himself \u00e2\u0080\u009cstunnin'\u00e2\u0080\u009d; and even the small\nyouth who had borne Mr. Bernard's invitation was effective in a new\njacket and trousers, buttony in front, and baggy in the reverse\naspect, as is wont to be the case with the home-made garments of inland\nyoungsters.\n\nGreat preparations had been made for the refection which was to be part\nof the entertainment. There was much clinking of borrowed spoons, which\nwere to be carefully counted, and much clicking of borrowed china, which\nwas to be tenderly handled, for nobody in the country keeps those vast\nclosets full of such things which one may see in rich city-houses. Not\na great deal could be done in the way of flowers, for there were no\ngreenhouses, and few plants were out as yet; but there were paper\nornaments for the candlesticks, and colored mats for the lamps, and\nall the tassels of the curtains and bells were taken out of those\nbrown linen bags, in which, for reasons hitherto undiscovered, they are\nhabitually concealed in some households. In the remoter apartments every\nimaginable operation was going on at once,--roasting, boiling, baking,\nbeating, rolling, pounding in mortars, frying, freezing; for there was\nto be ice-cream to-night of domestic manufacture;--and in the midst\nof all these labors, Mrs. Sprowle and Miss Matilda were moving about,\ndirecting and helping as they best might, all day long. When the evening\ncame, it might be feared they would not be in just the state of mind and\nbody to entertain company.\n\n--One would like to give a party now and then, if one could be a\nbillionaire.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAntoine, I am going to have twenty people to dine\nto-day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cBiens, Madame.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Not a word or thought more about it, but get\nhome in season to dress, and come down to your own table, one of\nyour own guests.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGiuseppe, we are to have a party a week from\nto-night,--five hundred invitations--there is the list.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The day comes.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam, do you remember you have your party tonight?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, so I have!\nEverything right? supper and all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll as it should be, Madam.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSend up Victorine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cVictorine, full toilet for this evening,--pink,\ndiamonds, and emeralds. Coiffeur at seven. Allez.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--Billionism, or\neven millionism, must be a blessed kind of state, with health and clear\nconscience and youth and good looks,--but most blessed is this, that\nit takes off all the mean cares which give people the three wrinkles\nbetween the eyebrows, and leaves them free to have a good time and make\nothers have a good time, all the way along from the charity that tips\nup unexpected loads of wood before widows' houses, and leaves foundling\nturkeys upon poor men's door-steps, and sets lean clergymen crying at\nthe sight of anonymous fifty-dollar bills, to the taste which orders a\nperfect banquet in such sweet accord with every sense that everybody's\nnature flowers out full--blown in its golden--glowing, fragrant\natmosphere.\n\n--A great party given by the smaller gentry of the interior is a kind\nof solemnity, so to speak. It involves so much labor and anxiety,--its\nspasmodic splendors are so violently contrasted with the homeliness of\nevery-day family-life,--it is such a formidable matter to break in the\nraw subordinates to the manege of the cloak-room and the table,--there\nis such a terrible uncertainty in the results of unfamiliar culinary\noperations,--so many feuds are involved in drawing that fatal line\nwhich divides the invited from the uninvited fraction of the local\nuniverse,--that, if the notes requested the pleasure of the guests'\ncompany on \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis solemn occasion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they would pretty nearly express the\ntrue state of things.\n\nThe Colonel himself had been pressed into the service. He had pounded\nsomething in the great mortar. He had agitated a quantity of sweetened\nand thickened milk in what was called a cream-freezer. At eleven\no'clock, A. M., he retired for a space. On returning, his color was\nnoted to be somewhat heightened, and he showed a disposition to be\njocular with the female help,--which tendency, displaying itself in\nlivelier demonstrations than were approved at head-quarters, led to his\nbeing detailed to out-of-door duties, such as raking gravel, arranging\nplaces for horses to be hitched to, and assisting in the construction of\nan arch of wintergreen at the porch of the mansion.\n\nA whiff from Mr. Geordie's cigar refreshed the toiling females from time\nto time; for the windows had to be opened occasionally, while all these\noperations were going on, and the youth amused himself with inspecting\nthe interior, encouraging the operatives now and then in the phrases\ncommonly employed by genteel young men,--for he had perused an odd\nvolume of \u00e2\u0080\u009cVerdant Green,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and was acquainted with a Sophomore from\none of the fresh-water colleges. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo it on the feed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed this\nspirited young man. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothin' like a good spread. Grub enough and good\nliquor, that's the ticket. Guv'nor'll do the heavy polite, and let me\nalone for polishin' off the young charmers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And Mr. Geordie looked\nexpressively at a handmaid who was rolling gingerbread, as if he were\nrehearsing for \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon Giovanni.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEvening came at last, and the ladies were forced to leave the scene of\ntheir labors to array themselves for the coming festivities. The tables\nhad been set in a back room, the meats were ready, the pickles were\ndisplayed, the cake was baked, the blanc-mange had stiffened, and the\nice-cream had frozen.\n\nAt half past seven o'clock, the Colonel, in costume, came into the front\nparlor, and proceeded to light the lamps. Some were good-humored enough\nand took the hint of a lighted match at once. Others were as vicious as\nthey could be,--would not light on any terms, any more than if they were\nfilled with water, or lighted and smoked one side of the chimney, or\nspattered a few sparks and sulked themselves out, or kept up a\nfaint show of burning, so that their ground glasses looked as feebly\nphosphorescent as so many invalid fireflies. With much coaxing and\nscrewing and pricking, a tolerable illumination was at last achieved.\nAt eight there was a grand rustling of silks, and Mrs. and Miss Sprowle\ndescended from their respective bowers or boudoirs. Of course they were\npretty well tired by this time, and very glad to sit down,--having the\nprospect before them of being obliged to stand for hours. The Colonel\nwalked about the parlor, inspecting his regiment of lamps. By and by Mr.\nGeordie entered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMph! mph!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he sniffed, as he came in. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou smell of lamp-smoke here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat always galls people,--to have a new-comer accuse them of smoke or\nclose air, which they have got used to and do not perceive. The Colonel\nraged at the thought of his lamps' smoking, and tongued a few anathemas\ninside of his shut teeth, but turned down two or three wicks that burned\nhigher than the rest.\n\nMaster H. Frederic next made his appearance, with questionable marks\nupon his fingers and countenance. Had been tampering with something\nbrown and sticky. His elder brother grew playful, and caught him by the\nbaggy reverse of his more essential garment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHush!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Sprowle,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthere 's the bell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEverybody took position at once, and began to look very smiling and\naltogether at ease.--False alarm. Only a parcel of spoons,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cloaned,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as\nthe inland folks say when they mean lent, by a neighbor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBetter late than never!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Colonel, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet me heft them spoons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Sprowle came down into her chair again as if all her bones had been\nbewitched out of her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm pretty nigh beat out a'ready,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbefore any of the folks\nhas come.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey sat silent awhile, waiting for the first arrival. How nervous they\ngot! and how their senses were sharpened!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHark!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miss Matilda,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat 's that rumblin'?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was a cart going over a bridge more than a mile off, which at any\nother time they would not have heard. After this there was a lull, and\npoor Mrs. Sprowle's head nodded once or twice. Presently a crackling and\ngrinding of gravel;--how much that means, when we are waiting for\nthose whom we long or dread to see! Then a change in the tone of the\ngravel-crackling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, they have turned in at our gate. They're comin'! Mother! mother!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEverybody in position, smiling and at ease. Bell rings. Enter the first\nset of visitors. The Event of the Season has begun.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLaw! it's nothin' but the Cranes' folks! I do believe Mahala 's come in\nthat old green de-laine she wore at the Surprise Party!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMiss Matilda had peeped through a crack of the door and made this\nobservation and the remark founded thereon. Continuing her attitude of\nattention, she overheard Mrs. Crane and her two daughters conversing in\nthe attiring-room, up one flight.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow fine everything is in the great house!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Crane,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cjest\nlook at the picters!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMatildy Sprowle's drawin's,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ada Azuba, the eldest daughter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should think so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mahala Crane, her younger sister,--a\nwide-awake girl, who had n't been to school for nothing, and performed a\nlittle on the lead pencil herself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should like to know whether that's\na hay-cock or a mountain!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMiss Matilda winced; for this must refer to her favorite monochrome,\nexecuted by laying on heavy shadows and stumping them down into mellow\nharmony,--the style of drawing which is taught in six lessons, and the\nkind of specimen which is executed in something less than one hour.\nParents and other very near relatives are sometimes gratified with these\nproductions, and cause them to be framed and hung up, as in the present\ninstance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess we won't go down jest yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Crane, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas folks don't\nseem to have come.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo she began a systematic inspection of the dressing-room and its\nconveniences.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMahogany four-poster;--come from the Jordans', I cal'la,te. Marseilles\nquilt. Ruffles all round the piller. Chintz curtings,--jest put up,--o'\npurpose for the party, I'll lay ye a dollar.--What a nice washbowl!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n (Taps it with a white knuckle belonging to a red finger.) \u00e2\u0080\u009cStone\nchaney.--Here's a bran'-new brush and comb,--and here's a scent-bottle.\nCome here, girls, and fix yourselves in the glass, and scent your\npocket-handkerchers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Mrs. Crane bedewed her own kerchief with some of the eau de Cologne\nof native manufacture,--said on its label to be much superior to the\nGerman article.\n\nIt was a relief to Mrs. and the Miss Cranes when the bell rang and the\nnext guests were admitted. Deacon and Mrs. Soper,--Deacon Soper of\nthe Rev. Mr. Fairweather's church, and his lady. Mrs. Deacon Soper was\ndirected, of course, to the ladies' dressing-room, and her husband to\nthe other apartment, where gentlemen were to leave their outside\ncoats and hats. Then came Mr. and Mrs. Briggs, and then the three Miss\nSpinneys, then Silas Peckham, Head of the Apollinean Institute, and Mrs.\nPeckham, and more after them, until at last the ladies' dressing-room\ngot so full that one might have thought it was a trap none of them could\nget out of. In truth, they all felt a little awkwardly. Nobody wanted\nto be first to venture down-stairs. At last Mr. Silas Peckham thought it\nwas time to make a move for the parlor, and for this purpose presented\nhimself at the door of the ladies' dressing-room.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLorindy, my dear!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed to Mrs. Peckham,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think there can be\nno impropriety in our joining the family down-stairs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Peckham laid her large, flaccid arm in the sharp angle made by the\nblack sleeve which held the bony limb her husband offered, and the two\ntook the stair and struck out for the parlor. The ice was broken, and\nthe dressing-room began to empty itself into the spacious, lighted\napartments below.\n\nMr. Silas Peckham slid into the room with Mrs. Peckham alongside, like a\nshad convoying a jelly-fish.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-evenin', Mrs. Sprowle! I hope I see you well this evenin'. How 's\nyour haalth, Colonel Sprowle?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, much obleeged to you. Hope you and your good lady are well.\nMuch pleased to see you. Hope you'll enjoy yourselves. We've laid out to\nhave everything in good shape,--spared no trouble nor ex\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cpence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--said Silas Peckham.\n\nMrs. Colonel Sprowle, who, you remember, was a Jordan, had nipped the\nColonel's statement in the middle of the word Mr. Peckham finished,\nwith a look that jerked him like one of those sharp twitches women keep\ngiving a horse when they get a chance to drive one.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Crane, Miss Ada Azuba, and Miss Mahala Crane made their\nentrance. There had been a discussion about the necessity and propriety\nof inviting this family, the head of which kept a small shop for hats\nand boots and shoes. The Colonel's casting vote had carried it in the\naffirmative.--How terribly the poor old green de-laine did cut up in the\nblaze of so many lamps and candles.\n\n--Deluded little wretch, male or female, in town or country, going to\nyour first great party, how little you know the nature of the ceremony\nin which you are to bear the part of victim! What! are not these\ngarlands and gauzy mists and many-colored streamers which adorn you, is\nnot this music which welcomes you, this radiance that glows about you,\nmeant solely for your enjoyment, young miss of seventeen or eighteen\nsummers, now for the first time swimming unto the frothy, chatoyant,\nsparkling, undulating sea of laces and silks and satins, and\nwhite-armed, flower-crowned maidens struggling in their waves beneath\nthe lustres that make the false summer of the drawing-room?\n\nStop at the threshold! This is a hall of judgment you are entering; the\ncourt is in session; and if you move five steps forward, you will be at\nits bar.\n\nThere was a tribunal once in France, as you may remember, called the\nChambre Ardente, the Burning Chamber. It was hung all round with lamps,\nand hence its name. The burning chamber for the trial of young maidens\nis the blazing ball-room. What have they full-dressed you, or rather\nhalf-dressed you for, do you think? To make you look pretty, of course!\nWhy have they hung a chandelier above you, flickering all over with\nflames, so that it searches you like the noonday sun, and your deepest\ndimple cannot hold a shadow? To give brilliancy to the gay scene,\nno doubt!--No, my clear! Society is inspecting you, and it finds\nundisguised surfaces and strong lights a convenience in the process.\nThe dance answers the purpose of the revolving pedestal upon which the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhite Captive\u00e2\u0080\u009d turns, to show us the soft, kneaded marble, which looks\nas if it had never been hard, in all its manifold aspects of living\nloveliness. No mercy for you, my love! Justice, strict justice, you\nshall certainly have,--neither more nor less. For, look you, there are\ndozens, scores, hundreds, with whom you must be weighed in the balance;\nand you have got to learn that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cstruggle for life\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Charles\nDarwin talks about reaches to vertebrates clad in crinoline, as well\nas to mollusks in shells, or articulates in jointed scales, or anything\nthat fights for breathing-room and food and love in any coat of fur or\nfeather! Happy they who can flash defiance from bright eyes and snowy\nshoulders back into the pendants of the insolent lustres!\n\n--Miss Mahala Crane did not have these reflections; and no young girl\never did, or ever will, thank Heaven! Her keen eyes sparkled under\nher plainly parted hair and the green de-laine moulded itself in those\nunmistakable lines of natural symmetry in which Nature indulges a small\nshopkeeper's daughter occasionally as well as a wholesale dealer's young\nladies. She would have liked a new dress as much as any other girl, but\nshe meant to go and have a good time at any rate.\n\nThe guests were now arriving in the drawing-room pretty fast, and the\nColonel's hand began to burn a good deal with the sharp squeezes which\nmany of the visitors gave it. Conversation, which had begun like a\nsummer-shower, in scattering drops, was fast becoming continuous, and\noccasionally rising into gusty swells, with now and then a broad-chested\nlaugh from some Captain or Major or other military personage,--for it\nmay be noted that all large and loud men in the unpaved districts bear\nmilitary titles.\n\nDeacon Soper came up presently, and entered into conversation with\nColonel Sprowle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope to see our pastor present this evenin',\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Deacon.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't feel quite sure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Colonel answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis dyspepsy has been\nbad on him lately. He wrote to say, that, Providence permittin',\nit would be agreeable to him to take a part in the exercises of the\nevenin'; but I mistrusted he did n't mean to come. To tell the truth,\nDeacon Soper, I rather guess he don't like the idee of dancin', and some\nof the other little arrangements.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Deacon, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know there's some condemns dancin'. I've\nheerd a good deal of talk about it among the folks round. Some have it\nthat it never brings a blessin' on a house to have dancin' in it. Judge\nTileston died, you remember, within a month after he had his great ball,\ntwelve year ago, and some thought it was in the natur' of a judgment.\nI don't believe in any of them notions. If a man happened to be struck\ndead the night after he'd been givin' a ball,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (the Colonel loosened his\nblack stock a little, and winked and swallowed two or three times,) \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nshould n't call it a judgment,--I should call it a coincidence. But I 'm\na little afraid our pastor won't come. Somethin' or other's the matter\nwith Mr. Fairweather. I should sooner expect to see the old Doctor come\nover out of the Orthodox parsonage-house.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI've asked him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Colonel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Deacon Soper.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe said he should like to come, but he did n't know what his people\nwould say. For his part, he loved to see young folks havin' their sports\ntogether, and very often felt as if he should like to be one of 'em\nhimself. 'But,' says I, 'Doctor, I don't say there won't be a little\ndancin'.' 'Don't!' says he, 'for I want Letty to go,' (she's his\ngranddaughter that's been stayin' with him,) 'and Letty 's mighty fond\nof dancin'. You know,' says the Doctor, 'it is n't my business to settle\nwhether other people's children should dance or not.' And the Doctor\nlooked as if he should like to rigadoon and sashy across as well as the\nyoung one he was talkin' about. He 's got blood in him, the old Doctor\nhas. I wish our little man and him would swop pulpits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDeacon Soper started and looked up into the Colonel's face, as if to see\nwhether he was in earnest.\n\nMr. Silas Peckham and his lady joined the group.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs this to be a Temperance Celebration, Mrs. Sprowle?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Mr. Silas\nPeckham.\n\nMrs. Sprowle replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat there would be lemonade and srub for those\nthat preferred such drinks, but that the Colonel had given folks to\nunderstand that he did n't mean to set in judgment on the marriage in\nCanaan, and that those that didn't like srub and such things would find\nsomethin' that would suit them better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDeacon Soper's countenance assumed a certain air of restrained\ncheerfulness. The conversation rose into one of its gusty paroxysms\njust then. Master H. Frederic got behind a door and began performing\nthe experiment of stopping and unstopping his ears in rapid alternation,\ngreatly rejoicing in the singular effect of mixed conversation chopped\nvery small, like the contents of a mince-pie, or meat-pie, as it is more\nforcibly called in the deep-rutted villages lying along the unsalted\nstreams. All at once it grew silent just round the door, where it had\nbeen loudest,--and the silence spread itself like a stain, till\nit hushed everything but a few corner-duets. A dark, sad-looking,\nmiddle-aged gentleman entered the parlor, with a young lady on his\narm,--his daughter, as it seemed, for she was not wholly unlike him in\nfeature, and of the same dark complexion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDudley Venner,\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed a dozen people, in startled, but\nhalf-suppressed tones.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat can have brought Dudley out to-night?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jefferson Buck, a\nyoung fellow, who had been interrupted in one of the corner-duets which\nhe was executing in concert with Miss Susy Pettingill.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do I know, Jeff?\u00e2\u0080\u009d was Miss Susy's answer. Then, after a\npause,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cElsie made him come, I guess. Go ask Dr. Kittredge; he knows\nall about 'em both, they say.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDr. Kittredge, the leading physician of Rockland, was a shrewd old man,\nwho looked pretty keenly into his patients through his spectacles,\nand pretty widely at men, women, and things in general over them.\nSixty-three years old,--just the year of the grand climacteric. A bald\ncrown, as every doctor should have. A consulting practitioner's mouth;\nthat is, movable round the corners while the case is under examination,\nbut both corners well drawn down and kept so when the final opinion is\nmade up. In fact, the Doctor was often sent for to act as \u00e2\u0080\u009ccaounsel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n all over the county, and beyond it. He kept three or four horses,\nsometimes riding in the saddle, commonly driving in a sulky, pretty\nfast, and looking straight before him, so that people got out of the way\nof bowing to him as he passed on the road. There was some talk about his\nnot being so long-sighted as other folks, but his old patients laughed\nand looked knowing when this was spoken of.\n\nThe Doctor knew a good many things besides how to drop tinctures\nand shake out powders. Thus, he knew a horse, and, what is harder to\nunderstand, a horse-dealer, and was a match for him. He knew what a\nnervous woman is, and how to manage her. He could tell at a glance when\nshe is in that condition of unstable equilibrium in which a rough word\nis like a blow to her, and the touch of unmagnetized fingers reverses\nall her nervous currents. It is not everybody that enters into the soul\nof Mozart's or Beethoven's harmonies; and there are vital symphonies in\nB flat, and other low, sad keys, which a doctor may know as little of as\na hurdy-gurdy player of the essence of those divine musical mysteries.\nThe Doctor knew the difference between what men say and what they mean\nas well as most people. When he was listening to common talk, he was in\nthe habit of looking over his spectacles; if he lifted his head so as\nto look through them at the person talking, he was busier with that\nperson's thoughts than with his words.\n\nJefferson Buck was not bold enough to confront the Doctor with Miss\nSusy's question, for he did not look as if he were in the mood to answer\nqueries put by curious young people. His eyes were fixed steadily on the\ndark girl, every movement of whom he seemed to follow.\n\nShe was, indeed, an apparition of wild beauty, so unlike the girls about\nher that it seemed nothing more than natural, that, when she moved, the\ngroups should part to let her pass through them, and that she should\ncarry the centre of all looks and thoughts with her. She was dressed to\nplease her own fancy, evidently, with small regard to the modes declared\ncorrect by the Rockland milliners and mantua-makers. Her heavy black\nhair lay in a braided coil, with a long gold pin shat through it like a\njavelin. Round her neck was a golden torque, a round, cord-like chain,\nsuch as the Gaols used to wear; the \u00e2\u0080\u009cDying Gladiator\u00e2\u0080\u009d has it. Her\ndress was a grayish watered silk; her collar was pinned with a flashing\ndiamond brooch, the stones looking as fresh as morning dew-drops, but\nthe silver setting of the past generation; her arms were bare, round,\nbut slender rather than large, in keeping with her lithe round figure.\nOn her wrists she wore bracelets: one was a circlet of enamelled scales;\nthe other looked as if it might have been Cleopatra's asp, with its body\nturned to gold and its eyes to emeralds.\n\nHer father--for Dudley Venner was her father--looked like a man of\nculture and breeding, but melancholy and with a distracted air, as one\nwhose life had met some fatal cross or blight. He saluted hardly anybody\nexcept his entertainers and the Doctor. One would have said, to look at\nhim, that he was not at the party by choice; and it was natural enough\nto think, with Susy Pettingill, that it must have been a freak of the\ndark girl's which brought him there, for he had the air of a shy and\nsad-hearted recluse.\n\nIt was hard to say what could have brought Elsie Venner to the party.\nHardly anybody seemed to know her, and she seemed not at all disposed to\nmake acquaintances. Here and there was one of the older girls from the\nInstitute, but she appeared to have nothing in common with them. Even in\nthe schoolroom, it may be remembered, she sat apart by her own choice,\nand now in the midst of the crowd she made a circle of isolation round\nherself. Drawing her arm out of her father's, she stood against the\nwall, and looked, with a strange, cold glitter in her eyes, at the crowd\nwhich moved and babbled before her.\n\nThe old Doctor came up to her by and by.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Elsie, I am quite surprised to find you here. Do tell me how you\nhappened to do such a good-natured thing as to let us see you at such a\ngreat party.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's been dull at the mansion-house,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I wanted to get\nout of it. It's too lonely there,--there's nobody to hate since Dick's\ngone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor laughed good-naturedly, as if this were an amusing bit of\npleasantry,--but he lifted his head and dropped his eyes a little, so\nas to see her through his spectacles. She narrowed her lids slightly, as\none often sees a sleepy cat narrow hers,--somewhat as you may remember\nour famous Margaret used to, if you remember her at all,--so that her\neyes looked very small, but bright as the diamonds on her breast. The\nold Doctor felt very oddly as she looked at him; he did not like the\nfeeling, so he dropped his head and lifted his eyes and looked at her\nover his spectacles again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd how have you all been at the mansion house?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, well enough. But Dick's gone, and there's nobody left but Dudley\nand I and the people. I'm tired of it. What kills anybody quickest,\nDoctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then, in a whisper, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI ran away again the other day, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere did you go?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Doctor spoke in a low, serious tone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, to the old place. Here, I brought this for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor started as she handed him a flower of the Atragene Americana,\nfor he knew that there was only one spot where it grew, and that not\none where any rash foot, least of all a thin-shod woman's foot, should\nventure.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow long were you gone?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly one night. You should have heard the horns blowing and the guns\nfiring. Dudley was frightened out of his wits. Old Sophy told him she'd\nhad a dream, and that I should be found in Dead-Man's Hollow, with a\ngreat rock lying on me. They hunted all over it, but they did n't find\nme,--I was farther up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDoctor Kittredge looked cloudy and worried while she was speaking, but\nforced a pleasant professional smile, as he said cheerily, and as if\nwishing to change the subject,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave a good dance this evening, Elsie. The fiddlers are tuning up.\nWhere 's the young master? has he come yet? or is he going to be late,\nwith the other great folks?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe girl turned away without answering, and looked toward the door.\n\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreat folks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d meaning the mansion-house gentry, were just beginning\nto come; Dudley Venner and his daughter had been the first of them.\nJudge Thornton, white-headed, fresh-faced, as good at sixty as he was\nat forty, with a youngish second wife, and one noble daughter, Arabella,\nwho, they said, knew as much law as her father, a stately, Portia like\ngirl, fit for a premier's wife, not like to find her match even in the\ngreat cities she sometimes visited; the Trecothicks, the family of a\nmerchant, (in the larger sense,) who, having made himself rich enough by\nthe time he had reached middle life, threw down his ledger as Sylla did\nhis dagger, and retired to make a little paradise around him in one\nof the stateliest residences of the town, a family inheritance; the\nVaughans, an old Rockland race, descended from its first settlers,\nToryish in tendency in Revolutionary times, and barely escaping\nconfiscation or worse; the Dunhams, a new family, dating its gentility\nonly as far back as the Honorable Washington Dunham, M. C., but turning\nout a clever boy or two that went to college; and some showy girls with\nwhite necks and fat arms who had picked up professional husbands: these\nwere the principal mansion-house people. All of them had made it a point\nto come; and as each of them entered, it seemed to Colonel and Mrs.\nSprowle that the lamps burned up with a more cheerful light, and that\nthe fiddles which sounded from the uncarpeted room were all half a tone\nhigher and half a beat quicker.\n\nMr. Bernard came in later than any of them; he had been busy with his\nnew duties. He looked well and that is saying a good deal; for nothing\nbut a gentleman is endurable in full dress. Hair that masses well,\na head set on with an air, a neckerchief tied cleverly by an easy,\npractised hand, close-fitting gloves, feet well shaped and well\ncovered,--these advantages can make us forgive the odious sable\nbroadcloth suit, which appears to have been adopted by society on the\nsame principle that condemned all the Venetian gondolas to perpetual and\nuniform blackness. Mr. Bernard, introduced by Mr. Geordie, made his\nbow to the Colonel and his lady and to Miss Matilda, from whom he got\na particularly gracious curtsy, and then began looking about him\nfor acquaintances. He found two or three faces he knew,--many more\nstrangers. There was Silas Peckham,--there was no mistaking him; there\nwas the inelastic amplitude of Mrs. Peckham; few of the Apollinean\ngirls, of course, they not being recognized members of society,--but\nthere is one with the flame in her cheeks and the fire in her eyes, the\ngirl of vigorous tints and emphatic outlines, whom we saw entering the\nschoolroom the other day. Old Judge Thornton has his eyes on her, and\nthe Colonel steals a look every now and then at the red brooch\nwhich lifts itself so superbly into the light, as if he thought it a\nwonderfully becoming ornament. Mr. Bernard himself was not displeased\nwith the general effect of the rich-blooded schoolgirl, as she stood\nunder the bright lamps, fanning herself in the warm, languid air, fixed\nin a kind of passionate surprise at the new life which seemed to be\nflowering out in her consciousness. Perhaps he looked at her somewhat\nsteadily, as some others had done; at any rate, she seemed to feel that\nshe was looked at, as people often do, and, turning her eyes suddenly\non him, caught his own on her face, gave him a half-bashful smile, and\nthrew in a blush involuntarily which made it more charming.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat can I do better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthan have a dance with Rosa\nMilburn?\u00e2\u0080\u009d So he carried his handsome pupil into the next room and took\nhis place with her in a cotillon. Whether the breath of the Goddess of\nLove could intoxicate like the cup of Circe,--whether a woman is ever\nphosphorescent with the luminous vapor of life that she exhales,--these\nand other questions which relate to occult influences exercised by\ncertain women we will not now discuss. It is enough that Mr. Bernard\nwas sensible of a strange fascination, not wholly new to him, nor\nunprecedented in the history of human experience, but always a\nrevelation when it comes over us for the first or the hundredth time,\nso pale is the most recent memory by the side of the passing moment with\nthe flush of any new-born passion on its cheek. Remember that Nature\nmakes every man love all women, and trusts the trivial matter of special\nchoice to the commonest accident.\n\nIf Mr. Bernard had had nothing to distract his attention, he might have\nthought too much about his handsome partner, and then gone home and\ndreamed about her, which is always dangerous, and waked up thinking of\nher still, and then begun to be deeply interested in her studies, and so\non, through the whole syllogism which ends in Nature's supreme quod erat\ndemonstrandum. What was there to distract him or disturb him? He did not\nknow,--but there was something. This sumptuous creature, this Eve just\nwithin the gate of an untried Paradise, untutored in the ways of the\nworld, but on tiptoe to reach the fruit of the tree of knowledge,--alive\nto the moist vitality of that warm atmosphere palpitating with voices\nand music, as the flower of some dioecious plant which has grown in a\nlone corner and suddenly unfolding its corolla on some hot-breathing\nJune evening, feels that the air is perfumed with strange odors and\nloaded with golden dust wafted from those other blossoms with which its\ndouble life is shared,--this almost over-womanized woman might well have\nbewitched him, but that he had a vague sense of a counter-charm. It was,\nperhaps, only the same consciousness that some one was looking at him\nwhich he himself had just given occasion to in his partner. Presently,\nin one of the turns of the dance, he felt his eyes drawn to a figure he\nhad not distinctly recognized, though he had dimly felt its presence,\nand saw that Elsie Venner was looking at him as if she saw nothing else\nbut him. He was not a nervous person, like the poor lady-teacher, yet\nthe glitter of the diamond eyes affected him strangely. It seemed to\ndisenchant the air, so full a moment before of strange attractions. He\nbecame silent, and dreamy, as it were. The round-limbed beauty at his\nside crushed her gauzy draperies against him, as they trod the figure of\nthe dance together, but it was no more to him than if an old nurse\nhad laid her hand on his sleeve. The young girl chafed at his seeming\nneglect, and her imperious blood mounted into her cheeks; but he\nappeared unconscious of it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is one of our young ladies I must speak to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,--and was\njust leaving his partner's side.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFour hands all round?\u00e2\u0080\u009d shouted the first violin,--and Mr. Bernard found\nhimself seized and whirled in a circle out of which he could not escape,\nand then forced to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccross over,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and then to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdozy do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the maestro\nhad it,--and when, on getting back to his place, he looked for Elsie\nVenner, she was gone.\n\nThe dancing went on briskly. Some of the old folks looked on, others\nconversed in groups and pairs, and so the evening wore along, until a\nlittle after ten o'clock. About this time there was noticed an increased\nbustle in the passages, with a considerable opening and shutting of\ndoors. Presently it began to be whispered about that they were going to\nhave supper. Many, who had never been to any large party before, held\ntheir breath for a moment at this announcement. It was rather with a\ntremulous interest than with open hilarity that the rumor was generally\nreceived.\n\nOne point the Colonel had entirely forgotten to settle. It was a point\ninvolving not merely propriety, but perhaps principle also, or at least\nthe good report of the house,--and he had never thought to arrange it.\nHe took Judge Thornton aside and whispered the important question to\nhim,--in his distress of mind, mistaking pockets and taking out his\nbandanna instead of his white handkerchief to wipe his forehead.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJudge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo you think, that, before we commence refreshing\nourselves at the tables, it would be the proper thing to--crave a--to\nrequest Deacon Soper or some other elderly person--to ask a blessing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Judge looked as grave as if he were about giving the opinion of the\nCourt in the great India-rubber case.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn the whole,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, after a pause, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should think it might,\nperhaps, be dispensed with on this occasion. Young folks are noisy, and\nit is awkward to have talking and laughing going on while blessing is\nbeing asked. Unless a clergyman is present and makes a point of it, I\nthink it will hardly be expected.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Colonel was infinitely relieved. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJudge, will you take Mrs. Sprowle\nin to supper?\u00e2\u0080\u009d And the Colonel returned the compliment by offering his\narm to Mrs. Judge Thornton.\n\nThe door of the supper-room was now open, and the company, following\nthe lead of the host and hostess, began to stream into it, until it was\npretty well filled.\n\nThere was an awful kind of pause. Many were beginning to drop their\nheads and shut their eyes, in anticipation of the usual petition before\na meal; some expected the music to strike up,--others, that an oration\nwould now be delivered by the Colonel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMake yourselves at home, ladies and gentlemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Colonel; \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood\nthings were made to eat, and you're welcome to all you see before you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying he attacked a huge turkey which stood at the head of the\ntable; and his example being followed first by the bold, then by the\ndoubtful, and lastly by the timid, the clatter soon made the circuit of\nthe tables. Some were shocked, however, as the Colonel had feared they\nwould be, at the want of the customary invocation. Widow Leech, a\nkind of relation, who had to be invited, and who came with her old,\nback-country-looking string of gold beads round her neck, seemed to feel\nvery serious about it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf she'd ha' known that folks would begrutch cravin' a blessin' over\nsech a heap o' provisions, she'd rather ha' staid t' home. It was a bad\nsign, when folks was n't grateful for the baounties of Providence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe elder Miss Spinney, to whom she made this remark, assented to it,\nat the same time ogling a piece of frosted cake, which she presently\nappropriated with great refinement of manner,--taking it between her\nthumb and forefinger, keeping the others well spread and the little\nfinger in extreme divergence, with a graceful undulation of the neck,\nand a queer little sound in her throat, as of an M that wanted to get\nout and perished in the attempt.\n\nThe tables now presented an animated spectacle. Young fellows of the\nmore dashing sort, with high stand-up collars and voluminous bows to\ntheir neckerchiefs, distinguished themselves by cutting up fowls and\noffering portions thereof to the buxom girls these knowing ones had\ncommonly selected.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA bit of the wing, Roxy, or of the--under limb?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe first laugh broke out at this, but it was premature, a sporadic\nlaugh, as Dr. Kittredge would have said, which did not become epidemic.\nPeople were very solemn as yet, many of them being new to such splendid\nscenes, and crushed, as it were, in the presence of so much crockery\nand so many silver spoons, and such a variety of unusual viands and\nbeverages. When the laugh rose around Roxy and her saucy beau, several\nlooked in that direction with an anxious expression, as if something had\nhappened, a lady fainted, for instance, or a couple of lively fellows\ncome to high words.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYoung folks will be young folks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Deacon Soper. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo harm done.\nLeast said soonest mended.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave some of these shell-oysters?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Colonel to Mrs. Trecothick.\n\nA delicate emphasis on the word shell implied that the Colonel knew what\nwas what. To the New England inland native, beyond the reach of the\neast winds, the oyster unconditioned, the oyster absolute, without a\nqualifying adjective, is the pickled oyster. Mrs. Trecothick, who knew\nvery well that an oyster long out of his shell (as is apt to be the\ncase with the rural bivalve) gets homesick and loses his sprightliness,\nreplied, with the pleasantest smile in the world, that the chicken she\nhad been helped to was too delicate to be given up even for the greater\nrarity. But the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cshell-oysters\u00e2\u0080\u009d had been overheard; and there was a\nperceptible crowding movement towards their newly discovered habitat, a\nlarge soup-tureen.\n\nSilas Peckham had meantime fallen upon another locality of these recent\nmollusks. He said nothing, but helped himself freely, and made a sign to\nMrs. Peckham.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLorindy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he whispered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshell-oysters\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd ladled them out to her largely, without betraying any emotion, just\nas if they had been the natural inland or pickled article.\n\nAfter the more solid portion of the banquet had been duly honored, the\ncakes and sweet preparations of various kinds began to get their share\nof attention. There were great cakes and little cakes, cakes with\nraisins in them, cakes with currants, and cakes without either; there\nwere brown cakes and yellow cakes, frosted cakes, glazed cakes, hearts\nand rounds, and jumbles, which playful youth slip over the forefinger\nbefore spoiling their annular outline. There were mounds of blo'monje,\nof the arrowroot variety,--that being undistinguishable from such as is\nmade with Russia isinglass. There were jellies, which had been shaking,\nall the time the young folks were dancing in the next room, as if\nthey were balancing to partners. There were built-up fabrics, called\nCharlottes, caky externally, pulpy within; there were also marangs, and\nlikewise custards,--some of the indolent-fluid sort, others firm, in\nwhich every stroke of the teaspoon left a smooth, conchoidal surface\nlike the fracture of chalcedony, with here and there a little eye like\nwhat one sees in cheeses. Nor was that most wonderful object of domestic\nart called trifle wanting, with its charming confusion of cream and cake\nand almonds and jam and jelly and wine and cinnamon and froth; nor yet\nthe marvellous floating-island,--name suggestive of all that is romantic\nin the imaginations of youthful palates.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt must have cost you a sight of work, to say nothin' of money, to get\nall this beautiful confectionery made for the party,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Crane to\nMrs. Sprowle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it cost some consid'able labor, no doubt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Sprowle.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMatilda and our girls and I made 'most all the cake with our own hands,\nand we all feel some tired; but if folks get what suits 'em, we don't\nbegrudge the time nor the work. But I do feel thirsty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\npoor lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I think a glass of srub would do my throat good; it's\ndreadful dry. Mr. Peckham, would you be so polite as to pass me a glass\nof srub?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSilas Peckham bowed with great alacrity, and took from the table a small\nglass cup, containing a fluid reddish in hue and subacid in taste.\nThis was srub, a beverage in local repute, of questionable nature, but\nsuspected of owing its tint and sharpness to some kind of syrup derived\nfrom the maroon-colored fruit of the sumac. There were similar small\ncups on the table filled with lemonade, and here and there a decanter of\nMadeira wine, of the Marsala kind, which some prefer to, and many more\ncannot distinguish from, that which comes from the Atlantic island.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake a glass of wine, Judge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said, the Colonel; \u00e2\u0080\u009chere is an article\nthat I rather think 'll suit you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Judge knew something of wines, and could tell all the famous old\nMadeiras from each other, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEclipse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cJuno,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the almost fabulously\nscarce and precious \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhite-top,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the rest. He struck the nativity of\nthe Mediterranean Madeira before it had fairly moistened his lip.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA sound wine, Colonel, and I should think of a genuine vintage. Your\nvery good health.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDeacon Soper,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Colonel, \u00e2\u0080\u009chere is some Madary Judge Thornton\nrecommends. Let me fill you a glass of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Deacon's eyes glistened. He was one of those consistent Christians\nwho stick firmly by the first miracle and Paul's advice to Timothy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA little good wine won't hurt anybody,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Deacon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlenty,\n--plenty,--plenty. There!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He had not withdrawn his glass, while the\nColonel was pouring, for fear it should spill, and now it was running\nover.\n\n--It is very odd how all a man's philosophy and theology are at the\nmercy of a few drops of a fluid which the chemists say consists of\nnothing but C4, O2, H6. The Deacon's theology fell off several points\ntowards latitudinarianism in the course of the next ten minutes. He had\na deep inward sense that everything was as it should be, human nature\nincluded. The little accidents of humanity, known collectively to\nmoralists as sin, looked very venial to his growing sense of universal\nbrotherhood and benevolence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will all come right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Deacon said to himself,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel a joyful\nconviction that everything is for the best. I am favored with a blessed\npeace of mind, and a very precious season of good feelin' toward my\nfellow-creturs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA lusty young fellow happened to make a quick step backward just at\nthat instant, and put his heel, with his weight on top of it, upon the\nDeacon's toes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAigh! What the d' d' didos are y' abaout with them great huffs o'\nyourn?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Deacon, with an expression upon his features not\nexactly that of peace and good-will to men. The lusty young fellow\napologized; but the Deacon's face did not come right, and his theology\nbacked round several points in the direction of total depravity.\n\nSome of the dashing young men in stand-up collars and extensive\nneckties, encouraged by Mr. Geordie, made quite free with the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMa,dary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and even induced some of the more stylish girls--not of the\nmansion-house set, but of the tip-top two-story families--to taste a\nlittle. Most of these young ladies made faces at it, and declared it was\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cperfectly horrid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with that aspect of veracity peculiar to their age\nand sex.\n\nAbout this time a movement was made on the part of some of the\nmansion-house people to leave the supper-table. Miss Jane Trecothick\nhad quietly hinted to her mother that she had had enough of it. Miss\nArabella Thornton had whispered to her father that he had better adjourn\nthis court to the next room. There were signs of migration,--a loosening\nof people in their places,--a looking about for arms to hitch on to.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStop!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Colonel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere's something coming yet.--Ice-cream!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe great folks saw that the play was not over yet, and that it was\nonly polite to stay and see it out. The word \u00e2\u0080\u009cice-cream\u00e2\u0080\u009d was no sooner\nwhispered than it passed from one to another all down the tables. The\neffect was what might have been anticipated. Many of the guests had\nnever seen this celebrated product of human skill, and to all the\ntwo-story population of Rockland it was the last expression of the art\nof pleasing and astonishing the human palate. Its appearance had been\ndeferred for several reasons: first, because everybody would have\nattacked it, if it had come in with the other luxuries; secondly,\nbecause undue apprehensions were entertained (owing to want of\nexperience) of its tendency to deliquesce and resolve itself with\nalarming rapidity into puddles of creamy fluid; and, thirdly, because\nthe surprise would make a grand climax to finish off the banquet.\n\nThere is something so audacious in the conception of ice-cream, that\nit is not strange that a population undebauched by the luxury of great\ncities looks upon it with a kind of awe and speaks of it with a certain\nemotion. This defiance of the seasons, forcing Nature to do her work\nof congelation in the face of her sultriest noon, might well inspire a\ntimid mind with fear lest human art were revolting against the Higher\nPowers, and raise the same scruples which resisted the use of ether and\nchloroform in certain contingencies. Whatever may be the cause, it is\nwell known that the announcement at any private rural entertainment that\nthere is to be ice-cream produces an immediate and profound impression.\nIt may be remarked, as aiding this impression, that exaggerated ideas\nare entertained as to the dangerous effects this congealed food may\nproduce on persons not in the most robust health.\n\nThere was silence as the pyramids of ice were placed on the table,\neverybody looking on in admiration. The Colonel took a knife and\nassailed the one at the head of the table. When he tried to cut off a\nslice, it didn't seem to understand it, however, and only tipped, as if\nit wanted to upset. The Colonel attacked it on the other side, and it\ntipped just as badly the other way. It was awkward for the Colonel.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPermit me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Judge,--and he took the knife and struck a sharp\nslanting stroke which sliced off a piece just of the right size, and\noffered it to Mrs. Sprowle. This act of dexterity was much admired by\nthe company.\n\nThe tables were all alive again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLorindy, here's a plate of ice-cream,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Silas Peckham.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, Mahaly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a fresh-looking young-fellow with a saucerful in\neach hand, \u00e2\u0080\u009chere's your ice-cream;--let's go in the corner and have a\ncelebration, us two.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And the old green de-lame, with the young curves\nunder it to make it sit well, moved off as pleased apparently as if it\nhad been silk velvet with thousand-dollar laces over it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, now, Miss Green! do you think it's safe to put that cold stuff\ninto your stomick?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Widow Leech to a young married lady, who,\nfinding the air rather warm, thought a little ice would cool her down\nvery nicely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's jest like eatin' snowballs. You don't look very\nrugged; and I should be dreadful afeard, if I was you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCarrie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said old Dr. Kittredge, who had overheard this,--\u00e2\u0080\u009chow well\nyou're looking this evening! But you must be tired and heated;--sit down\nhere, and let me give you a good slice of ice-cream. How you young folks\ndo grow up, to be sure! I don't feel quite certain whether it's you or\nyour older sister, but I know it 's somebody I call Carrie, and that I\n've known ever since.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA sound something between a howl and an oath startled the company\nand broke off the Doctor's sentence. Everybody's eyes turned in the\ndirection from which it came. A group instantly gathered round the\nperson who had uttered it, who was no other than Deacon Soper.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe's chokin'! he's chokin'!\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the first exclamation,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cslap him on\nthe back!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSeveral heavy fists beat such a tattoo on his spine that the Deacon felt\nas if at least one of his vertebrae would come up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe's black in the face,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Widow Leech, \u00e2\u0080\u009che 's swallered somethin'\nthe wrong way. Where's the Doctor?--let the Doctor get to him, can't\nye?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you will move, my good lady, perhaps I can,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Doctor Kittredge,\nin a calm tone of voice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe's not choking, my friends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor\nadded immediately, when he got sight of him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt 's apoplexy,--I told you so,--don't you see how red he is in the\nface?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said old Mrs. Peake, a famous woman for \u00e2\u0080\u009cnussin\u00e2\u0080\u009d sick folks,\n--determined to be a little ahead of the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's not apoplexy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Kittredge.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is it, Doctor? what is it? Will he die? Is he dead?--Here's his\npoor wife, the Widow Soper that is to be, if she a'n't a'ready.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo be quiet, my good woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Kittredge.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing serious, I\nthink, Mrs. Soper. Deacon!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe sudden attack of Deacon Soper had begun with the extraordinary sound\nmentioned above. His features had immediately assumed an expression of\nintense pain, his eyes staring wildly, and, clapping his hands to his\nface, he had rocked his head backward and forward in speechless agony.\n\nAt the Doctor's sharp appeal the Deacon lifted his head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's all right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, as soon as he saw his face. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nDeacon had a smart attack of neuralgic pain. That 's all. Very severe,\nbut not at all dangerous.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor kept his countenance, but his diaphragm was shaking the\nchange in iris waistcoat-pockets with subterranean laughter. He had\nlooked through his spectacles and seen at once what had happened.\nThe Deacon, not being in the habit of taking his nourishment in the\ncongealed state, had treated the ice-cream as a pudding of a rare\nspecies, and, to make sure of doing himself justice in its distribution,\nhad taken a large mouthful of it without the least precaution. The\nconsequence was a sensation as if a dentist were killing the nerves of\ntwenty-five teeth at once with hot irons, or cold ones, which would hurt\nrather worse.\n\nThe Deacon swallowed something with a spasmodic effort, and recovered\npretty soon and received the congratulations of his friends. There were\ndifferent versions of the expressions he had used at the onset of his\ncomplaint,--some of the reported exclamations involving a breach of\npropriety, to say the least,--but it was agreed that a man in an attack\nof neuralgy wasn't to be judged of by the rules that applied to other\nfolks.\n\nThe company soon after this retired from the supper-room. The\nmansion-house gentry took their leave, and the two-story people soon\nfollowed. Mr. Bernard had stayed an hour or two, and left soon after he\nfound that Elsie Venner and her father had disappeared. As he passed by\nthe dormitory of the Institute, he saw a light glimmering from one of\nits upper rooms, where the lady-teacher was still waking. His heart\nached, when he remembered, that, through all these hours of gayety, or\nwhat was meant for it, the patient girl had been at work in her little\nchamber; and he looked up at the silent stars, as if to see that they\nwere watching over her. The planet Mars was burning like a red coal; the\nnorthern constellation was slanting downward about its central point of\nflame; and while he looked, a falling star slid from the zenith and was\nlost.\n\nHe reached his chamber and was soon dreaming over the Event of the\nSeason.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. THE MORNING AFTER.\n\nColonel Sprowle's family arose late the next morning. The fatigues and\nexcitements of the evening and the preparation for it were followed by\na natural collapse, of which somnolence was a leading symptom. The sun\nshone into the window at a pretty well opened angle when the Colonel\nfirst found himself sufficiently awake to address his yet slumbering\nspouse.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSally!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Colonel, in a voice that was a little husky,--for he\nhad finished off the evening with an extra glass or two of \u00e2\u0080\u009cMadary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n and had a somewhat rusty and headachy sense of renewed existence, on\ngreeting the rather advanced dawn,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSally!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake care o' them custard-cups! There they go!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPoor Mrs. Sprowle was fighting the party over in her dream; and as the\nvisionary custard-cups crashed down through one lobe of her brain into\nanother, she gave a start as if an inch of lightning from a quart Leyden\njar had jumped into one of her knuckles with its sudden and lively\npoonk!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSally!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Colonel,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cwake up, wake up. What 'r' y' dreamin'\nabaout?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Sprowle raised herself, by a sort of spasm, sur son seant, as they\nsay in France,--up on end, as we have it in New England. She looked\nfirst to the left, then to the right, then straight before her,\napparently without seeing anything, and at last slowly settled down,\nwith her two eyes, blank of any particular meaning, directed upon the\nColonel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat time is 't?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTen o'clock. What y' been dreamin' abaout? Y' giv a jump like a\nhopper-grass. Wake up, wake UP! Th' party 's over, and y' been asleep\nall the mornin'. The party's over, I tell ye! Wake up!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOver!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Sprowle, who began to define her position at\nlast,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cover! I should think 't was time 't was over! It's lasted a\nhundud year. I've been workin' for that party longer 'n Methuselah's\nlifetime, sence I been asleep. The pies would n' bake, and the blo'monje\nwould n' set, and the ice-cream would n' freeze, and all the folks\nkep' comin' 'n' comin' 'n' comin',--everybody I ever knew in all my\nlife,--some of 'em 's been dead this twenty year 'n' more,--'n' nothin'\nfor 'em to eat nor drink. The fire would n' burn to cook anything, all\nwe could do. We blowed with the belluses, 'n' we stuffed in paper 'n'\npitch-pine kindlin's, but nothin' could make that fire burn; 'n' all the\ntime the folks kep' comin', as if they'd never stop,--'n' nothin' for\n'em but empty dishes, 'n' all the borrowed chaney slippin' round on the\nwaiters 'n' chippin' 'n' crackin',--I would n' go through what I been\nthrough t'-night for all th' money in th' Bank,--I do believe it's\nharder t' have a party than t'\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\nMrs. Sprowle stated the case strongly.\n\nThe Colonel said he did n't know how that might be. She was a better\njudge than he was. It was bother enough, anyhow, and he was glad that\nit was over. After this, the worthy pair commenced preparations for\nrejoining the waking world, and in due time proceeded downstairs.\n\nEverybody was late that morning, and nothing had got put to rights. The\nhouse looked as if a small army had been quartered in it over night.\nThe tables were of course in huge disorder, after the protracted assault\nthey had undergone. There had been a great battle evidently, and it had\ngone against the provisions. Some points had been stormed, and all their\ndefences annihilated, but here and there were centres of resistance\nwhich had held out against all attacks,--large rounds of beef, and\nsolid loaves of cake, against which the inexperienced had wasted their\nenergies in the enthusiasm of youth or uninformed maturity, while the\nlonger-headed guests were making discoveries of \u00e2\u0080\u009cshell-oysters\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cpatridges\u00e2\u0080\u009d and similar delicacies.\n\nThe breakfast was naturally of a somewhat fragmentary character. A\nchicken that had lost his legs in the service of the preceding campaign\nwas once more put on duty. A great ham stuck with cloves, as Saint\nSebastian was with arrows, was again offered for martyrdom. It would\nhave been a pleasant sight for a medical man of a speculative turn to\nhave seen the prospect before the Colonel's family of the next week's\nbreakfasts, dinners, and suppers. The trail that one of these\ngreat rural parties leaves after it is one of its most formidable\nconsiderations. Every door-handle in the house is suggestive of\nsweetmeats for the next week, at least. The most unnatural articles of\ndiet displace the frugal but nutritious food of unconvulsed periods\nof existence. If there is a walking infant about the house, it\nwill certainly have a more or less fatal fit from overmuch of some\nindigestible delicacy. Before the week is out, everybody will be tired\nto death of sugary forms of nourishment and long to see the last of the\nremnants of the festival.\n\nThe family had not yet arrived at this condition. On the contrary,\nthe first inspection of the tables suggested the prospect of days of\nunstinted luxury; and the younger portion of the household, especially,\nwere in a state of great excitement as the account of stock was taken\nwith reference to future internal investments. Some curious facts came\nto light during these researches.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere's all the oranges gone to?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Sprowle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI expected\nthere'd be ever so many of 'em left. I did n't see many of the folks\neatin' oranges. Where's the skins of 'em? There ought to be six dozen\norange-skins round on the plates, and there a'n't one dozen. And all\nthe small cakes, too, and all the sugar things that was stuck on the\nbig cakes. Has anybody counted the spoons? Some of 'em got swallered,\nperhaps. I hope they was plated ones, if they did!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe failure of the morning's orange-crop and the deficit in other\nexpected residual delicacies were not very difficult to account for. In\nmany of the two-story Rockland families, and in those favored households\nof the neighboring villages whose members had been invited to the great\nparty, there was a very general excitement among the younger people on\nthe morning after the great event. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid y' bring home somethin' from the\nparty? What is it? What is it? Is it frut-cake? Is it nuts and oranges\nand apples? Give me some! Give me some!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Such a concert of treble\nvoices uttering accents like these had not been heard since the great\nTemperance Festival with the celebrated \u00e2\u0080\u009ccolation\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the open air under\nthe trees of the Parnassian Grove,--as the place was christened by the\nyoung ladies of the Institute. The cry of the children was not in\nvain. From the pockets of demure fathers, from the bags of sharp-eyed\nspinsters, from the folded handkerchiefs of light-fingered sisters, from\nthe tall hats of sly-winking brothers, there was a resurrection of\nthe missing oranges and cakes and sugar-things in many a rejoicing\nfamily-circle, enough to astonish the most hardened \u00e2\u0080\u009ccaterer\u00e2\u0080\u009d that ever\ncontracted to feed a thousand people under canvas.\n\nThe tender recollections of those dear little ones whom extreme youth or\nother pressing considerations detain from scenes of festivity--a trait\nof affection by no means uncommon among our thoughtful people--dignifies\nthose social meetings where it is manifested, and sheds a ray of\nsunshine on our common nature. It is \u00e2\u0080\u009can oasis in the desert,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--to\nuse the striking expression of the last year's \u00e2\u0080\u009cValedictorian\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the\nApollinean Institute. In the midst of so much that is purely selfish, it\nis delightful to meet such disinterested care for others. When a\nlarge family of children are expecting a parent's return from an\nentertainment, it will often require great exertions on his part to\nfreight himself so as to meet their reasonable expectations. A few rules\nare worth remembering by all who attend anniversary dinners in Faneuil\nHall or elsewhere. Thus: Lobsters' claws are always acceptable to\nchildren of all ages. Oranges and apples are to be taken one at a time,\nuntil the coat-pockets begin to become inconveniently heavy. Cakes are\ninjured by sitting upon them; it is, therefore, well to carry a stout\ntin box of a size to hold as many pieces as there are children in the\ndomestic circle. A very pleasant amusement, at the close of one of\nthese banquets, is grabbing for the flowers with which the table is\nembellished. These will please the ladies at home very greatly, and, if\nthe children are at the same time abundantly supplied with fruits, nuts,\ncakes, and any little ornamental articles of confectionery which are of\na nature to be unostentatiously removed, the kind-hearted parent will\nmake a whole household happy, without any additional expense beyond the\noutlay for his ticket.\n\nThere were fragmentary delicacies enough left, of one kind and another,\nat any rate, to make all the Colonel's family uncomfortable for the next\nweek. It bid fair to take as long to get rid of the remains of the great\nparty as it had taken to make ready for it.\n\nIn the mean time Mr. Bernard had been dreaming, as young men dream, of\ngliding shapes with bright eyes and burning cheeks, strangely blended\nwith red planets and hissing meteors, and, shining over all, the white,\nun-wandering star of the North, girt with its tethered constellations.\n\nAfter breakfast he walked into the parlor, where he found Miss Darley.\nShe was alone, and, holding a school-book in her hand, was at work with\none of the morning's lessons. She hardly noticed him as he entered,\nbeing very busy with her book,--and he paused a moment before speaking,\nand looked at her with a kind of reverence. It would not have been\nstrictly true to call her beautiful. For years,--since her earliest\nwomanhood,--those slender hands had taken the bread which repaid the\ntoil of heart and brain from the coarse palms which offered it in the\nworld's rude market. It was not for herself alone that she had bartered\naway the life of her youth, that she had breathed the hot air of\nschoolrooms, that she had forced her intelligence to posture before\nher will, as the exigencies of her place required,--waking to mental\nlabor,--sleeping to dream of problems,--rolling up the stone of\neducation for an endless twelvemonth's term, to find it at the bottom\nof the hill again when another year called her to its renewed duties,\nschooling her temper in unending inward and outward conflicts, until\nneither dulness nor obstinacy nor ingratitude nor insolence could\nreach her serene self-possession. Not for herself alone. Poorly as her\nprodigal labors were repaid in proportion to the waste of life they\ncost, her value was too well established to leave her without what,\nunder other circumstances, would have been a more than sufficient\ncompensation. But there were others who looked to her in their need,\nand so the modest fountain which might have been filled to its brim was\ncontinually drained through silent-flowing, hidden sluices.\n\nOut of such a life, inherited from a race which had lived in conditions\nnot unlike her own, beauty, in the common sense of the term, could\nhardly find leisure to develop and shape itself. For it must be\nremembered, that symmetry and elegance of features and figure, like\nperfectly formed crystals in the mineral world, are reached only by\ninsuring a certain necessary repose to individuals and to generations.\nHuman beauty is an agricultural product in the country, growing up in\nmen and women as in corn and cattle, where the soil is good. It is a\nluxury almost monopolized by the rich in cities, bred under glass like\ntheir forced pine-apples and peaches. Both in city and country, the\nevolution of the physical harmonies which make music to our eyes\nrequires a combination of favorable circumstances, of which alternations\nof unburdened tranquillity with intervals of varied excitement of mind\nand body are among the most important. Where sufficient excitement is\nwanting, as often happens in the country, the features, however rich in\nred and white, get heavy, and the movements sluggish; where excitement\nis furnished in excess, as is frequently the case in cities, the\ncontours and colors are impoverished, and the nerves begin to make their\nexistence known to the consciousness, as the face very soon informs us.\n\nHelen Darley could not, in the nature of things, have possessed the kind\nof beauty which pleases the common taste. Her eye was calm, sad-looking,\nher features very still, except when her pleasant smile changed them for\na moment, all her outlines were delicate, her voice was very gentle,\nbut somewhat subdued by years of thoughtful labor, and on her smooth\nforehead one little hinted line whispered already that Care was\nbeginning to mark the trace which Time sooner or later would make a\nfurrow. She could not be a beauty; if she had been, it would have been\nmuch harder for many persons to be interested in her. For, although in\nthe abstract we all love beauty, and although, if we were sent naked\nsouls into some ultramundane warehouse of soulless bodies and told to\nselect one to our liking, we should each choose a handsome one, and\nnever think of the consequences,--it is quite certain that beauty\ncarries an atmosphere of repulsion as well as of attraction with it,\nalike in both sexes. We may be well assured that there are many persons\nwho no more think of specializing their love of the other sex upon one\nendowed with signal beauty, than they think of wanting great diamonds or\nthousand-dollar horses. No man or woman can appropriate beauty\nwithout paying for it,--in endowments, in fortune, in position, in\nself-surrender, or other valuable stock; and there are a great many who\nare too poor, too ordinary, too humble, too busy, too proud, to pay any\nof these prices for it. So the unbeautiful get many more lovers than\nthe beauties; only, as there are more of them, their lovers are spread\nthinner and do not make so much show.\n\nThe young master stood looking at Helen Darley with a kind of tender\nadmiration. She was such a picture of the martyr by the slow social\ncombustive process, that it almost seemed to him he could see a pale\nlambent nimbus round her head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did not see you at the great party last evening,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, presently.\n\nShe looked up and answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. I have not much taste for such large\ncompanies. Besides, I do not feel as if my time belonged to me after\nit has been paid for. There is always something to do, some lesson or\nexercise,--and it so happened, I was very busy last night with the new\nproblems in geometry. I hope you had a good time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery. Two or three of our girls were there. Rosa Milburn. What a beauty\nshe is! I wonder what she feeds on! Wine and musk and chloroform and\ncoals of fire, I believe; I didn't think there was such color and flavor\nin a woman outside the tropics.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMiss Darley smiled rather faintly; the imagery was not just to her\ntaste: femineity often finds it very hard to accept the fact of\nmuliebrity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWas\u00e2\u0080\u009d--?\n\nShe stopped short; but her question had asked itself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cElsie there? She was, for an hour or so. She looked frightfully\nhandsome. I meant to have spoken to her, but she slipped away before I\nknew it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought she meant to go to the party,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miss Darley. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid she\nlook at you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe did. Why?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you did not speak to her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. I should have spoken to her, but she was gone when I looked for\nher. A strange creature! Is n't there an odd sort of fascination about\nher? You have not explained all the mystery about the girl. What does\nshe come to this school for? She seems to do pretty much as she likes\nabout studying.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMiss Darley answered in very low tones. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a fancy of hers to come,\nand they let her have her way. I don't know what there is about her,\nexcept that she seems to take my life out of me when she looks at me. I\ndon't like to ask other people about our girls. She says very little to\nanybody, and studies, or makes believe to study, almost what she likes.\nI don't know what she is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Miss Darley laid her hand, trembling, on the\nyoung master's sleeve,) \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I can tell when she is in the room without\nseeing or hearing her. Oh, Mr. Langdon, I am weak and nervous, and no\ndoubt foolish,--but--if there were women now, as in the days of our\nSaviour, possessed of devils, I should think there was something not\nhuman looking out of Elsie Venner's eyes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe poor girl's breast rose and fell tumultuously as she spoke, and her\nvoice labored, as if some obstruction were rising in her throat.\n\nA scene might possibly have come of it, but the door opened. Mr. Silas\nPeckham. Miss Darley got away as soon as she well could.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy did not Miss Darley go to the party last evening?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr.\nBernard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, the fact is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Mr. Silas Peckham, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Darley,\nshe's pooty much took up with the school. She's an industris young.\nwoman,--yis, she is industris,--but perhaps she a'n't quite so spry a\nworker as some. Maybe, considerin' she's paid for her time, she is n't\nfur out o' the way in occoopyin' herself evenin's,--that--is, if so\nbe she a'n't smart enough to finish up all her work in the daytime.\nEdoocation is the great business of the Institoot. Amoosements are\nobjec's of a secondary natur', accordin' to my v'oo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d [The unspellable\npronunciation of this word is the touchstone of New England Brahminism.]\n\nMr. Bernard drew a deep breath, his thin nostrils dilating, as if the\nair did not rush in fast enough to cool his blood, while Silas Peckham\nwas speaking. The Head of the Apollinean Institute delivered himself\nof these judicious sentiments in that peculiar acid, penetrating tone,\nthickened with a nasal twang, which not rarely becomes hereditary after\nthree or four generations raised upon east winds, salt fish, and large,\nwhite-bellied, pickled cucumbers. He spoke deliberately, as if weighing\nhis words well, so that, during his few remarks, Mr. Bernard had time\nfor a mental accompaniment with variations, accented by certain bodily\nchanges, which escaped Mr. Peckham's observation. First there was a\nfeeling of disgust and shame at hearing Helen Darley spoken of like a\ndumb working animal. That sent the blood up into his cheeks. Then the\nslur upon her probable want of force--her incapacity, who made the\ncharacter of the school and left this man to pocket its profits--sent\na thrill of the old Wentworth fire through him, so that his muscles\nhardened, his hands closed, and he took the measure of Mr. Silas\nPeckham, to see if his head would strike the wall in case he went over\nbackwards all of a sudden. This would not do, of course, and so the\nthrill passed off and the muscles softened again. Then came that state\nof tenderness in the heart, overlying wrath in the stomach, in which the\neyes grow moist like a woman's, and there is also a great boiling-up of\nobjectionable terms out of the deep-water vocabulary, so that Prudence\nand Propriety and all the other pious P's have to jump upon the lid of\nspeech to keep them from boiling over into fierce articulation. All\nthis was internal, chiefly, and of course not recognized by Mr. Silas\nPeckham. The idea, that any full-grown, sensible man should have any\nother notion than that of getting the most work for the least money out\nof his assistants, had never suggested itself to him.\n\nMr. Bernard had gone through this paroxysm, and cooled down, in the\nperiod while Mr. Peckham was uttering these words in his thin, shallow\nwhine, twanging up into the frontal sinuses. What was the use of losing\nhis temper and throwing away his place, and so, among the consequences\nwhich would necessarily follow, leaving the poor lady-teacher without\na friend to stand by her ready to lay his hand on the grand-inquisitor\nbefore the windlass of his rack had taken one turn too many?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo doubt, Mr. Peckham,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, in a grave, calm voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is\na great deal of work to be done in the school; but perhaps we can\ndistribute the duties a little more evenly after a time. I shall look\nover the girls' themes myself, after this week. Perhaps there will be\nsome other parts of her labor that I can take on myself. We can arrange\na new programme of studies and recitations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can do that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Silas Peckham. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I don't propose mater'lly\nalterin' Miss Darley's dooties. I don't think she works to hurt herself.\nSome of the Trustees have proposed interdoosin' new branches of study,\nand I expect you will be pooty much occoopied with the dooties that\nbelong to your place. On the Sahbath you will be able to attend divine\nservice three times, which is expected of our teachers. I shall continoo\nmyself to give Sahbath Scriptur' readin's to the young ladies. That is\na solemn dooty I can't make up my mind to commit to other people. My\nteachers enjoy the Lord's day as a day of rest. In it they do no manner\nof work, except in cases of necessity or mercy, such as fillin' out\ndiplomas, or when we git crowded jest at the end of a term, or when\nthere is an extry number of p'oopils, or other Providential call to\ndispense with the ordinance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Bernard had a fine glow in his cheeks by this time,--doubtless\nkindled by the thought of the kind consideration Mr. Peckham showed for\nhis subordinates in allowing them the between meeting-time on Sundays\nexcept for some special reason. But the morning was wearing away; so\nhe went to the schoolroom, taking leave very properly of his respected\nprincipal, who soon took his hat and departed.\n\nMr. Peckham visited certain \u00e2\u0080\u009cstores\u00e2\u0080\u009d or shops, where he made inquiries\nafter various articles in the provision-line, and effected a purchase or\ntwo. Two or three barrels of potatoes, which had sprouted in a promising\nway, he secured at a bargain. A side of feminine beef was also obtained\nat a low figure. He was entirely satisfied with a couple of barrels of\nflour, which, being invoiced \u00e2\u0080\u009cslightly damaged,\u00e2\u0080\u009d were to be had at a\nreasonable price.\n\nAfter this, Silas Peckham felt in good spirits. He had done a pretty\nstroke of business. It came into his head whether he might not follow\nit up with a still more brilliant speculation. So he turned his steps in\nthe direction of Colonel Sprowle's.\n\nIt was now eleven o'clock, and the battle-field of last evening was as\nwe left it. Mr. Peckham's visit was unexpected, perhaps not very well\ntimed, but the Colonel received him civilly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeautifully lighted,--these rooms last night!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Peckham.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWinter-strained?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Colonel nodded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow much do you pay for your winter-strained?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Colonel told him the price.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery hahnsome supper,--very hahnsome. Nothin' ever seen like it in\nRockland. Must have been a great heap of things leftover.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe compliment was not ungrateful, and the Colonel acknowledged it by\nsmiling and saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should think the' was a trifle? Come and look.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen Silas Peckham saw how many delicacies had survived the evening's\nconflict, his commercial spirit rose at once to the point of a proposal.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cColonel Sprowle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere's 'meat and cakes and pies and\npickles enough on that table to spread a hahnsome colation. If you'd\nlike to trade reasonable, I think perhaps I should be willin' to take\n'em off your hands. There's been a talk about our havin' a celebration\nin the Parnassian Grove, and I think I could work in what your folks\ndon't want and make myself whole by chargin' a small sum for tickets.\nBroken meats, of course, a'n't of the same valoo as fresh provisions; so\nI think you might be willin' to trade reasonable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Peckham paused and rested on his proposal. It would not, perhaps,\nhave been very extraordinary, if Colonel Sprowle had entertained the\nproposition. There is no telling beforehand how such things will strike\npeople. It didn't happen to strike the Colonel favorably. He had a\nlittle red-blooded manhood in him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSell you them things to make a colation out of?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Colonel replied.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWalk up to that table, Mr. Peckham, and help yourself! Fill your\npockets; Mr. Peckham! Fetch a basket, and our hired folks shall fill\nit full for ye! Send a cart, if y' like, 'n' carry off them leavin's to\nmake a celebration for your pupils with! Only let me tell ye this:--as\nsure 's my name's Hezekiah Spraowle, you 'll be known through the taown\n'n' through the caounty, from that day forrard, as the Principal of the\nBroken-Victuals Institoot!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEven provincial human-nature sometimes has a touch of sublimity about\nit. Mr. Silas Peckham had gone a little deeper than he meant, and come\nupon the \u00e2\u0080\u009chard pan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the well-diggers call it, of the Colonel's\ncharacter, before he thought of it. A militia-colonel standing on his\nsentiments is not to be despised. That was shown pretty well in New\nEngland two or three generations ago. There were a good many plain\nofficers that talked about their \u00e2\u0080\u009crigiment\u00e2\u0080\u009d and their \u00e2\u0080\u009ccaounty\u00e2\u0080\u009d who knew\nvery well how to say \u00e2\u0080\u009cMake ready!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cTake aim!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cFire!\u00e2\u0080\u009d--in the face of a\nline of grenadiers with bullets in their guns and bayonets on them. And\nthough a rustic uniform is not always unexceptionable in its cut and\ntrimmings, yet there was many an ill-made coat in those old times that\nwas good enough to be shown to the enemy's front rank too often to\nbe left on the field with a round hole in its left lapel that matched\nanother going right through the brave heart of the plain country captain\nor major or colonel who was buried in it under the crimson turf.\n\nMr. Silas Peckham said little or nothing. His sensibilities were not\nacute, but he perceived that he had made a miscalculation. He hoped that\nthere was no offence,--thought it might have been mutooally agreeable,\nconclooded he would give up the idee of a colation, and backed himself\nout as if unwilling to expose the less guarded aspect of his person to\nthe risk of accelerating impulses.\n\nThe Colonel shut the door,--cast his eye on the toe of his right boot,\nas if it had had a strong temptation,--looked at his watch, then round\nthe room, and, going to a cupboard, swallowed a glass of deep-red brandy\nand water to compose his feelings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. THE DOCTOR ORDERS THE BEST SULKY. (With a Digression on\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHired Help.\u00e2\u0080\u009d)\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cABEL! Slip Cassia into the new sulky, and fetch her round.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAbel was Dr. Kittredge's hired man. He was born in New Hampshire, a\nqueer sort of State, with fat streaks of soil and population where they\nbreed giants in mind and body, and lean streaks which export imperfectly\nnourished young men with promising but neglected appetites, who may be\nfound in great numbers in all the large towns, or could be until of\nlate years, when they have been half driven out of their favorite\nbasement-stories by foreigners, and half coaxed away from them by\nCalifornia. New Hampshire is in more than one sense the Switzerland of\nNew England. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cGranite State\u00e2\u0080\u009d being naturally enough deficient in\npudding-stone, its children are apt to wander southward in search of\nthat deposit,--in the unpetrified condition.\n\nAbel Stebbins was a good specimen of that extraordinary hybrid or\nmule between democracy and chrysocracy, a native-born New-England\nserving-man. The Old World has nothing at all like him. He is at once an\nemperor and a subordinate. In one hand he holds one five-millionth part\n(be the same more or less) of the power that sways the destinies of the\nGreat Republic. His other hand is in your boot, which he is about to\npolish. It is impossible to turn a fellow citizen whose vote may make\nhis master--say, rather, employer--Governor or President, or who may\nbe one or both himself, into a flunky. That article must be imported\nready-made from other centres of civilization. When a New Englander has\nlost his self-respect as a citizen and as a man, he is demoralized, and\ncannot be trusted with the money to pay for a dinner.\n\nIt may be supposed, therefore, that this fractional emperor, this\ncontinent-shaper, finds his position awkward when he goes into service,\nand that his employer is apt to find it still more embarrassing. It\nis always under protest that the hired man does his duty. Every act of\nservice is subject to the drawback, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am as good as you are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is\nso common, at least, as almost to be the rule, and partly accounts for\nthe rapid disappearance of the indigenous \u00e2\u0080\u009cdomestic\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the basements\nabove mentioned. Paleontologists will by and by be examining the floors\nof our kitchens for tracks of the extinct native species of serving-man.\nThe female of the same race is fast dying out; indeed, the time is not\nfar distant when all the varieties of young woman will have vanished\nfrom New England, as the dodo has perished in the Mauritius. The young\nlady is all that we shall have left, and the mop and duster of the last\nAhnira or Loizy will be stared at by generations of Bridgets and Noras\nas that famous head and foot of the lost bird are stared at in the\nAshmolean Museum.\n\nAbel Stebbins, the Doctor's man, took the true American view of his\ndifficult position. He sold his time to the Doctor, and, having sold it,\nhe took care to fulfil his half of the bargain. The Doctor, on his\npart, treated him, not like a gentleman, because one does not order a\ngentleman to bring up his horse or run his errands, but he treated him\nlike a man. Every order was given in courteous terms. His reasonable\nprivileges were respected as much as if they had been guaranteed under\nhand and seal. The Doctor lent him books from his own library, and gave\nhim all friendly counsel, as if he were a son or a younger brother.\n\nAbel had Revolutionary blood in his veins, and though he saw fit to\n\u00e2\u0080\u009chire out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he could never stand the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cservant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or consider himself\nthe inferior one of the two high contracting parties. When he came\nto live with the Doctor, he made up his mind he would dismiss the old\ngentleman, if he did not behave according to his notions of propriety.\nBut he soon found that the Doctor was one of the right sort, and so\ndetermined to keep him. The Doctor soon found, on his side, that he had\na trustworthy, intelligent fellow, who would be invaluable to him, if he\nonly let him have his own way of doing what was to be done.\n\nThe Doctor's hired man had not the manners of a French valet. He was\ngrave and taciturn for the most part, he never bowed and rarely smiled,\nbut was always at work in the daytime, and always reading in the\nevening. He was hostler, and did all the housework that a man could\nproperly do, would go to the door or \u00e2\u0080\u009ctend table,\u00e2\u0080\u009d bought the provisions\nfor the family,--in short, did almost everything for them but get their\nclothing. There was no office in a perfectly appointed household, from\nthat of steward down to that of stable-boy, which he did not cheerfully\nassume. His round of work not consuming all his energies, he must needs\ncultivate the Doctor's garden, which he kept in one perpetual bloom,\nfrom the blowing of the first crocus to the fading of the last dahlia.\n\nThis garden was Abel's poem. Its half-dozen beds were so many cantos.\nNature crowded them for him with imagery such as no Laureate could\ncopy in the cold mosaic of language. The rhythm of alternating dawn and\nsunset, the strophe and antistrophe still perceptible through all the\nsudden shifts of our dithyrambic seasons and echoed in corresponding\nfloral harmonies, made melody in the soul of Abel, the plain\nserving-man. It softened his whole otherwise rigid aspect. He worshipped\nGod according to the strict way of his fathers; but a florist's\nPuritanism is always colored by the petals of his flowers,--and Nature\nnever shows him a black corolla.\n\nHe may or may not figure again in this narrative; but as there must\nbe some who confound the New England hired man, native-born, with\nthe servant of foreign birth, and as there is the difference of two\ncontinents and two civilizations between them, it did not seem fair to\nlet Abel bring round the Doctor's mare and sulky without touching his\nfeatures in half-shadow into our background.\n\nThe Doctor's mare, Cassia, was so called by her master from her cinnamon\ncolor, cassia being one of the professional names for that spice or\ndrug. She was of the shade we call sorrel, or, as an Englishman would\nperhaps say, chestnut,--a genuine \u00e2\u0080\u009cMorgan\u00e2\u0080\u009d mare, with a low forehand, as\nis common in this breed, but with strong quarters and flat hocks, well\nribbed up, with a good eye and a pair of lively ears,--a first-rate\ndoctor's beast, would stand until her harness dropped off her back at\nthe door of a tedious case, and trot over hill and dale thirty miles in\nthree hours, if there was a child in the next county with a bean in\nits windpipe and the Doctor gave her a hint of the fact. Cassia was\nnot large, but she had a good deal of action, and was the Doctor's\nshow-horse. There were two other animals in his stable: Quassia or\nQuashy, the black horse, and Caustic, the old bay, with whom he jogged\nround the village.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA long ride to-day?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Abel, as he brought up the equipage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust out of the village,--that 's all.--There 's a kink in her\nmane,--pull it out, will you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGoin' to visit some of the great folks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Abel said to himself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWonder\nwho it is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--Then to the Doctor,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnybody get sick at Sprowles's? They\nsay Deacon Soper had a fit, after eatin' some o' their frozen victuals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor smiled. He guessed the Deacon would do well enough. He was\nonly going to ride over to the Dudley mansion-house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. THE DOCTOR CALLS ON ELSIE VENNER.\n\nIf that primitive physician, Chiron, M. D., appears as a Centaur, as\nwe look at him through the lapse of thirty centuries, the modern\ncountry-doctor, if he could be seen about thirty miles off, could not be\ndistinguished from a wheel-animalcule. He inhabits a wheel-carriage.\nHe thinks of stationary dwellings as Long Tom Coffin did of land in\ngeneral; a house may be well enough for incidental purposes, but for\na \u00e2\u0080\u009cstiddy\u00e2\u0080\u009d residence give him a \u00e2\u0080\u009ckerridge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If he is classified in the\nLinnaean scale, he must be set down thus: Genus Homo; Species Rotifer\ninfusorius, the wheel-animal of infusions.\n\nThe Dudley mansion was not a mile from the Doctor's; but it never\noccurred to him to think of walking to see any of his patients'\nfamilies, if he had any professional object in his visit. Whenever the\nnarrow sulky turned in at a gate, the rustic who was digging potatoes,\nor hoeing corn, or swishing through the grass with his scythe, in\nwave-like crescents, or stepping short behind a loaded wheelbarrow,\nor trudging lazily by the side of the swinging, loose-throated,\nshort-legged oxen, rocking along the road as if they had just been\nlanded after a three-months' voyage, the toiling native, whatever he was\ndoing, stopped and looked up at the house the Doctor was visiting.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSomebody sick over there t' Haynes's. Guess th' old man's ailin' ag'in.\nWinder's half-way open in the chamber,--should n' wonder 'f he was dead\nand laid aout. Docterin' a'n't no use, when y' see th' winders open like\nthat. Wahl, money a'n't much to speak of to th' old man naow! He don'\nwant but tew cents,--'n' old Widah Peake, she knows what he wants them\nfor!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOr again,--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMeasles raound pooty thick. Briggs's folks buried two children with\n'em lass' week. Th' of Doctor, he'd h' ker'd 'em threugh. Struck in 'n'\np'dooced mo't'f'cation,--so they say.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis is only meant as a sample of the kind of way they used to think or\ntalk, when the narrow sulky turned in at the gate of some house where\nthere was a visit to be made.\n\nOh, that narrow sulky! What hopes, what fears, what comfort, what\nanguish, what despair, in the roll of its coming or its parting wheels!\nIn the spring, when the old people get the coughs which give them a few\nshakes and their lives drop in pieces like the ashes of a burned thread\nwhich have kept the threadlike shape until they were stirred,--in the\nhot summer noons, when the strong man comes in from the fields, like the\nson of the Shunamite, crying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy head, my head,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--in the dying autumn\ndays, when youth and maiden lie fever-stricken in many a household,\nstill-faced, dull-eyed, dark-flushed, dry-lipped, low-muttering in their\ndaylight dreams, their fingers moving singly like those of slumbering\nharpers,--in the dead winter, when the white plague of the North has\ncaged its wasted victims, shuddering as they think of the frozen soil\nwhich must be quarried like rock to receive them, if their perpetual\nconvalescence should happen to be interfered with by any untoward\naccident,--at every season, the narrow sulky rolled round freighted with\nunmeasured burdens of joy and woe.\n\nThe Doctor drove along the southern foot of The Mountain. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cDudley\nMansion\u00e2\u0080\u009d was near the eastern edge of this declivity, where it rose\nsteepest, with baldest cliffs and densest patches of overhanging wood.\nIt seemed almost too steep to climb, but a practised eye could see from\na distance the zigzag lines of the sheep-paths which scaled it like\nminiature Alpine roads. A few hundred feet up The Mountain's side was\na dark deep dell, unwooded, save for a few spindling, crazy-looking\nhackmatacks or native larches, with pallid green tufts sticking out\nfantastically all over them. It shelved so deeply, that, while the\nhemlock-tassels were swinging on the trees around its border, all would\nbe still at its springy bottom, save that perhaps a single fern would\nwave slowly backward and forward like a sabre with a twist as of a\nfeathered oar,--and this when not a breath could be felt, and every\nother stem and blade were motionless. There was an old story of one\nhaving perished here in the winter of '86, and his body having been\nfound in the spring,--whence its common name of \u00e2\u0080\u009cDead-Man's Hollow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Higher up there were huge cliffs with chasms, and, it was thought,\nconcealed caves, where in old times they said that Tories lay hid,--some\nhinted not without occasional aid and comfort from the Dudleys then\nliving in the mansion-house. Still higher and farther west lay the\naccursed ledge,--shunned by all, unless it were now and then a daring\nyouth, or a wandering naturalist who ventured to its edge in the hope\nof securing some infantile Crotalus durissus, who had not yet cut his\npoison teeth.\n\nLong, long ago, in old Colonial times, the Honorable Thomas Dudley,\nEsquire, a man of note and name and great resources, allied by descent\nto the family of \u00e2\u0080\u009cTom Dudley,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the early Governor is sometimes\nirreverently called by our most venerable, but still youthful\nantiquary,--and to the other public Dudleys, of course,--of all of\nwhom he made small account, as being himself an English gentleman, with\nlittle taste for the splendors of provincial office, early in the last\ncentury, Thomas Dudley had built this mansion. For several generations\nit had been dwelt in by descendants of the same name, but soon after the\nRevolution it passed by marriage into the hands of the Venners, by whom\nit had ever since been held and tenanted.\n\nAs the doctor turned an angle in the road, all at once the stately old\nhouse rose before him. It was a skilfully managed effect, as it well\nmight be, for it was no vulgar English architect who had planned the\nmansion and arranged its position and approach. The old house rose\nbefore the Doctor, crowning a terraced garden, flanked at the left by an\navenue of tall elms. The flower-beds were edged with box, which diffused\naround it that dreamy balsamic odor, full of ante-natal reminiscences\nof a lost Paradise, dimly fragrant as might be the bdellium of ancient\nHavilah, the land compassed by the river Pison that went out of Eden.\nThe garden was somewhat neglected, but not in disgrace,--and in the time\nof tulips and hyacinths, of roses, of \u00e2\u0080\u009csnowballs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d of honeysuckles, of\nlilacs, of syringas, it was rich with blossoms.\n\nFrom the front-windows of the mansion the eye reached a far\nblue mountain-summit,--no rounded heap, such as often shuts in a\nvillage-landscape, but a sharp peak, clean-angled as Ascutney from\nthe Dartmouth green. A wide gap through miles of woods had opened this\ndistant view, and showed more, perhaps, than all the labors of the\narchitect and the landscape-gardener the large style of the early\nDudleys.\n\nThe great stone-chimney of the mansion-house was the centre from which\nall the artificial features of the scene appeared to flow. The roofs,\nthe gables, the dormer-windows, the porches, the clustered offices in\nthe rear, all seemed to crowd about the great chimney. To this\ncentral pillar the paths all converged. The single poplar behind the\nhouse,--Nature is jealous of proud chimneys, and always loves to put\na poplar near one, so that it may fling a leaf or two down its black\nthroat every autumn,--the one tall poplar behind the house seemed to nod\nand whisper to the grave square column, the elms to sway their branches\ntowards it. And when the blue smoke rose from its summit, it seemed to\nbe wafted away to join the azure haze which hung around the peak in the\nfar distance, so that both should bathe in a common atmosphere.\n\nBehind the house were clumps of lilacs with a century's growth upon\nthem, and looking more like trees than like shrubs. Shaded by a group of\nthese was the ancient well, of huge circuit, and with a low arch opening\nout of its wall about ten feet below the surface,--whether the door of a\ncrypt for the concealment of treasure, or of a subterranean passage, or\nmerely of a vault for keeping provisions cool in hot weather, opinions\ndiffered.\n\nOn looking at the house, it was plain that it was built with Old-World\nnotions of strength and durability, and, so far as might be, with\nOld-World materials. The hinges of the doors stretched out like arms,\ninstead of like hands, as we make them. The bolts were massive enough\nfor a donjon-keep. The small window-panes were actually inclosed in the\nwood of the sashes instead of being stuck to them with putty, as in our\nmodern windows. The broad staircase was of easy ascent, and was guarded\nby quaintly turned and twisted balusters. The ceilings of the two rooms\nof state were moulded with medallion-portraits and rustic figures,\nsuch as may have been seen by many readers in the famous old Philipse\nhouse,--Washington's head-quarters,--in the town of Yorkers. The\nfire-places, worthy of the wide-throated central chimney, were bordered\nby pictured tiles, some of them with Scripture stories, some with\nWatteau-like figures,--tall damsels in slim waists and with spread\nenough of skirt for a modern ballroom, with bowing, reclining, or\nmusical swains of what everybody calls the \u00e2\u0080\u009cconventional\u00e2\u0080\u009d sort,--that\nis, the swain adapted to genteel society rather than to a literal\nsheep-compelling existence.\n\nThe house was furnished, soon after it was completed, with many heavy\narticles made in London from a rare wood just then come into fashion,\nnot so rare now, and commonly known as mahogany. Time had turned it very\ndark, and the stately bedsteads and tall cabinets and claw-footed\nchairs and tables were in keeping with the sober dignity of the ancient\nmansion. The old \u00e2\u0080\u009changings\u00e2\u0080\u009d were yet preserved in the chambers, faded,\nbut still showing their rich patterns,--properly entitled to their name,\nfor they were literally hung upon flat wooden frames like trellis-work,\nwhich again were secured to the naked partitions.\n\nThere were portraits of different date on the walls of the various\napartments, old painted coats-of-arms, bevel-edged mirrors, and in one\nsleeping-room a glass case of wax-work flowers and spangly symbols,\nwith a legend signifying that E. M. (supposed to be Elizabeth Mascarene)\nwished not to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cforgot\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n         \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I am dead and lay'd in dust\n          And all my bones are\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\nPoor E. M.! Poor everybody that sighs for earthly remembrance in a\nplanet with a core of fire and a crust of fossils!\n\nSuch was the Dudley mansion-house,--for it kept its ancient name in\nspite of the change in the line of descent. Its spacious apartments\nlooked dreary and desolate; for here Dudley Venner and his daughter\ndwelt by themselves, with such servants only as their quiet mode of\nlife required. He almost lived in his library, the western room on the\nground-floor. Its window looked upon a small plat of green, in the midst\nof which was a single grave marked by a plain marble slab. Except this\nroom, and the chamber where he slept, and the servants' wing, the rest\nof the house was all Elsie's. She was always a restless, wandering\nchild from her early years, and would have her little bed moved from one\nchamber to another,--flitting round as the fancy took her. Sometimes she\nwould drag a mat and a pillow into one of the great empty rooms, and,\nwrapping herself in a shawl, coil up and go to sleep in a corner.\nNothing frightened her; the \u00e2\u0080\u009chaunted\u00e2\u0080\u009d chamber, with the torn hangings\nthat flapped like wings when there was air stirring, was one of her\nfavorite retreats. She had been a very hard creature to manage. Her\nfather could influence, but not govern her. Old Sophy, born of a slave\nmother in the house, could do more with her than anybody, knowing her\nby long instinctive study. The other servants were afraid of her. Her\nfather had sent for governesses, but none of them ever stayed long. She\nmade them nervous; one of them had a strange fit of sickness; not one of\nthem ever came back to the house to see her. A young Spanish woman who\ntaught her dancing succeeded best with her, for she had a passion for\nthat exercise, and had mastered some of the most difficult dances.\nLong before this period, she had manifested some most extraordinary\nsingularities of taste or instinct. The extreme sensitiveness of her\nfather on this point prevented any allusion to them; but there\nwere stories floating round, some of them even getting into the\npapers,--without her name, of course,--which were of a kind to excite\nintense curiosity, if not more anxious feelings. This thing was certain,\nthat at the age of twelve she was missed one night, and was found\nsleeping in the open air under a tree, like a wild creature. Very often\nshe would wander off by day, always without a companion, bringing home\nwith her a nest, a flower, or even a more questionable trophy of her\nramble, such as showed that there was no place where she was afraid to\nventure. Once in a while she had stayed out over night, in which\ncase the alarm was spread, and men went in search of her, but never\nsuccessfully,--so--that some said she hid herself in trees, and others\nthat she had found one of the old Tory caves.\n\nSome, of course, said she was a crazy girl, and ought to be sent to an\nAsylum. But old Dr. Kittredge had shaken his head, and told them to bear\nwith her, and let her have her way as much as they could, but watch her,\nas far as possible, without making her suspicious of them. He visited\nher now and then, under the pretext of seeing her father on business, or\nof only making a friendly call.\n\nThe Doctor fastened his horse outside the gate, and walked up the\ngarden-alley. He stopped suddenly with a start. A strange sound had\njarred upon his ear. It was a sharp prolonged rattle, continuous, but\nrising and falling as if in rhythmical cadence. He moved softly towards\nthe open window from which the sound seemed to proceed.\n\nElsie was alone in the room, dancing one of those wild Moorish\nfandangos, such as a matador hot from the Plaza de Toros of Seville or\nMadrid might love to lie and gaze at. She was a figure to look upon\nin silence. The dancing frenzy must have seized upon her while she\nwas dressing; for she was in her bodice, bare-armed, her hair floating\nunbound far below the waist of her barred or banded skirt. She had\ncaught up her castanets, and rattled them as she danced with a kind of\npassionate fierceness, her lithe body undulating with flexuous grace,\nher diamond eyes glittering, her round arms wreathing and unwinding,\nalive and vibrant to the tips of the slender fingers. Some passion\nseemed to exhaust itself in this dancing paroxysm; for all at once she\nreeled from the middle of the floor, and flung herself, as it were in\na careless coil, upon a great tiger's-skin which was spread out in one\ncorner of the apartment.\n\nThe old Doctor stood motionless, looking at her as she lay panting on\nthe tawny, black-lined robe of the dead monster which stretched out\nbeneath her, its rude flattened outline recalling the Terror of the\nJungle as he crouched for his fatal spring. In a few moments her head\ndrooped upon her arm, and her glittering eyes closed,--she was sleeping.\nHe stood looking at her still, steadily, thoughtfully, tenderly.\nPresently he lifted his hand to his forehead, as if recalling some\nfading remembrance of other years.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPoor Catalina!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was all he said. He shook his head,--implying that his visit would\nbe in vain to-day,--returned to his sulky, and rode away, as if in a\ndream.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. COUSIN RICHARD'S VISIT.\n\nThe Doctor was roused from his revery by the clatter of approaching\nhoofs. He looked forward and saw a young fellow galloping rapidly\ntowards him.\n\nA common New-England rider with his toes turned out, his elbows jerking\nand the daylight showing under him at every step, bestriding a cantering\nbeast of the plebeian breed, thick at every point where he should be\nthin, and thin at every point where he should be thick, is not one of\nthose noble objects that bewitch the world. The best horsemen outside of\nthe cities are the unshod countryboys, who ride \u00e2\u0080\u009cbareback,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with only a\nhalter round the horse's neck, digging their brown heels into his ribs,\nand slanting over backwards, but sticking on like leeches, and taking\nthe hardest trot as if they loved it.--This was a different sight\non which the Doctor was looking. The streaming mane and tail of the\nunshorn, savage-looking, black horse, the dashing grace with which the\nyoung fellow in the shadowy sombrero, and armed with the huge spurs,\nsat in his high-peaked saddle, could belong only to the mustang of the\nPampas and his master. This bold rider was a young man whose sudden\napparition in the quiet inland town had reminded some of the good people\nof a bright, curly-haired boy they had known some eight or ten years\nbefore as little Dick Venner.\n\nThis boy had passed several of his early years at the Dudley mansion,\nthe playmate of Elsie, being her cousin, two or three years older than\nherself, the son of Captain Richard Venner, a South American trader,\nwho, as he changed his residence often, was glad to leave the boy in his\nbrother's charge. The Captain's wife, this boy's mother, was a lady of\nBuenos Ayres, of Spanish descent, and had died while the child was in\nhis cradle. These two motherless children were as strange a pair as one\nroof could well cover. Both handsome, wild, impetuous, unmanageable,\nthey played and fought together like two young leopards, beautiful, but\ndangerous, their lawless instincts showing through all their graceful\nmovements.\n\nThe boy was little else than a young Gaucho when he first came to\nRockland; for he had learned to ride almost as soon as to walk, and\ncould jump on his pony and trip up a runaway pig with the bolas or noose\nhim with his miniature lasso at an age when some city-children would\nhardly be trusted out of sight of a nursery-maid. It makes men imperious\nto sit a horse; no man governs his fellows so well as from this living\nthrone. And so, from Marcus Aurelius in Roman bronze, down to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cman\non horseback\u00e2\u0080\u009d in General Cushing's prophetic speech, the saddle has\nalways been the true seat of empire. The absolute tyranny of the human\nwill over a noble and powerful beast develops the instinct of personal\nprevalence and dominion; so that horse-subduer and hero were almost\nsynonymous in simpler times, and are closely related still. An ancestry\nof wild riders naturally enough bequeaths also those other tendencies\nwhich we see in the Tartars, the Cossacks, and our own Indian Centaurs,\nand as well, perhaps, in the old-fashioned fox-hunting squire as in\nany of these. Sharp alternations of violent action and self-indulgent\nrepose; a hard run, and a long revel after it; this is what over-much\nhorse tends to animalize a man into. Such antecedents may have helped\nto make little Dick Venner a self-willed, capricious boy, and a rough\nplaymate for Elsie.\n\nElsie was the wilder of the two. Old Sophy, who used to watch them\nwith those quick, animal-looking eyes of hers,--she was said to be\nthe granddaughter of a cannibal chief, and inherited the keen senses\nbelonging to all creatures which are hunted as game, Old Sophy, who\nwatched them in their play and their quarrels, always seemed to be more\nafraid for the boy than the girl. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMasse Dick! Masse Dick! don' you be\ntoo rough wi' dat gal! She scratch you las' week, 'n' some day she\nbite you; 'n' if she bite you, Masse Dick!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Old Sophy nodded her head\nominously, as if she could say a great deal more; while, in grateful\nacknowledgment of her caution, Master Dick put his two little fingers\nin the angles of his mouth, and his forefingers on his lower eyelids,\ndrawing upon these features until his expression reminded her of\nsomething she vaguely recollected in her infancy,--the face of\na favorite deity executed in wood by an African artist for her\ngrandfather, brought over by her mother, and burned when she became a\nChristian.\n\nThese two wild children had much in common. They loved to ramble\ntogether, to build huts, to climb trees for nests, to ride the colts,\nto dance, to race, and to play at boys' rude games as if both were boys.\nBut wherever two natures have a great deal in common, the conditions of\na first-rate quarrel are furnished ready-made. Relations are very apt to\nhate each other just because they are too much alike. It is so frightful\nto be in an atmosphere of family idiosyncrasies; to see all the\nhereditary uncomeliness or infirmity of body, all the defects of speech,\nall the failings of temper, intensified by concentration, so that every\nfault of our own finds itself multiplied by reflections, like our images\nin a saloon lined with mirrors! Nature knows what she is about. The\ncentrifugal principle which grows out of the antipathy of like to like\nis only the repetition in character of the arrangement we see expressed\nmaterially in certain seed-capsules, which burst and throw the seed to\nall points of the compass. A house is a large pod with a human germ\nor two in each of its cells or chambers; it opens by dehiscence of the\nfront-door by and by, and projects one of its germs to Kansas, another\nto San Francisco, another to Chicago, and so on; and this that Smith may\nnot be Smithed to death and Brown may not be Browned into a mad-house,\nbut mix in with the world again and struggle back to average humanity.\n\nElsie's father, whose fault was to indulge her in everything, found that\nit would never do to let these children grow up together. They would\neither love each other as they got older, and pair like wild creatures,\nor take some fierce antipathy, which might end nobody could tell where.\nIt was not safe to try. The boy must be sent away. A sharper quarrel\nthan common decided this point. Master Dick forgot Old Sophy's caution,\nand vexed the girl into a paroxysm of wrath, in which she sprang at him\nand bit his arm. Perhaps they made too much of it; for they sent for the\nold Doctor, who came at once when he heard what had happened. He had a\ngood deal to say about the danger there was from the teeth of animals\nor human beings when enraged; and as he emphasized his remarks by the\napplication of a pencil of lunar caustic to each of the marks left by\nthe sharp white teeth, they were like to be remembered by at least one\nof his hearers.\n\nSo Master Dick went off on his travels, which led him into strange\nplaces and stranger company. Elsie was half pleased and half sorry to\nhave him go; the children had a kind of mingled liking and hate for each\nother, just such as is very common among relations. Whether the girl had\nmost satisfaction in the plays they shared, or in teasing him, or taking\nher small revenge upon him for teasing her, it would have been hard to\nsay. At any rate, she was lonely without him. She had more fondness for\nthe old black woman than anybody; but Sophy could not follow her far\nbeyond her own old rocking-chair. As for her father, she had made him\nafraid of her, not for his sake, but for her own. Sometimes she would\nseem to be fond of him, and the parent's heart would yearn within him as\nshe twined her supple arms about him; and then some look she gave him,\nsome half-articulated expression, would turn his cheek pale and almost\nmake him shiver, and he would say kindly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow go, Elsie, dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\nsmile upon her as she went, and close and lock the door softly after\nher. Then his forehead would knot and furrow itself, and the drops of\nanguish stand thick upon it. He would go to the western window of\nhis study and look at the solitary mound with the marble slab for its\nhead-stone. After his grief had had its way, he would kneel down and\npray for his child as one who has no hope save in that special grace\nwhich can bring the most rebellious spirit into sweet subjection. All\nthis might seem like weakness in a parent having the charge of one\nsole daughter of his house and heart; but he had tried authority and\ntenderness by turns so long without any good effect, that he had become\nsore perplexed, and, surrounding her with cautious watchfulness as he\nbest might, left her in the main to her own guidance and the merciful\ninfluences which Heaven might send down to direct her footsteps.\n\nMeantime the boy grew up to youth and early manhood through a strange\nsuccession of adventures. He had been at school at Buenos Ayres,--had\nquarrelled with his mother's relatives,--had run off to the Pampas, and\nlived with the Gauchos;--had made friends with the Indians, and ridden\nwith them, it was rumored, in some of their savage forays,--had\nreturned and made up his quarrel,--had got money by inheritance or\notherwise,--had troubled the peace of certain magistrates,--had found\nit convenient to leave the City of Wholesome Breezes for a time, and\nhad galloped off on a fast horse of his, (so it was said,) with some\nofficers riding after him, who took good care (but this was only the\npopular story) not to catch him. A few days after this he was taking\nhis ice on the Alameda of Mendoza, and a week or two later sailed from\nValparaiso for New York, carrying with him the horse with which he\nhad scampered over the Plains, a trunk or two with his newly purchased\noutfit of, clothing and other conveniences, and a belt heavy with gold\nand with a few Brazilian diamonds sewed in it, enough in value to serve\nhim for a long journey.\n\nDick Venner had seen life enough to wear out the earlier sensibilities\nof adolescence. He was tired of worshipping or tyrannizing over the\nbistred or umbered beauties of mingled blood among whom he had been\nliving. Even that piquant exhibition which the Rio de Mendoza presents\nto the amateur of breathing sculpture failed to interest him. He was\nthinking of a far-off village on the other side of the equator, and of\nthe wild girl with whom he used to play and quarrel, a creature of a\ndifferent race from these degenerate mongrels.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA game little devil she was, sure enough!\u00e2\u0080\u009d--And as Dick spoke, he bared\nhis wrist to look for the marks she had left on it: two small white\nscars, where the two small sharp upper teeth had struck when she flashed\nat him with her eyes sparkling as bright as those glittering stones\nsewed up in the belt he wore. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat's a filly worth noosing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dick\nto himself, as he looked in admiration at the sign of her spirit and\npassion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wonder if she will bite at eighteen as she did at eight! She\nshall have a chance to try, at any rate!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSuch was the self-sacrificing disposition with which Richard Venner,\nEsq., a passenger by the Condor from Valparaiso, set foot upon his\nnative shore, and turned his face in the direction of Rockland, The\nMountain, and the mansion-house. He had heard something, from time\nto time, of his New-England relatives, and knew that they were living\ntogether as he left them. And so he heralded himself to \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear Uncle\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n by a letter signed \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour loving nephew, Richard Venner,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in which letter\nhe told a very frank story of travel and mercantile adventure, expressed\nmuch gratitude for the excellent counsel and example which had helped to\nform his character and preserve him in the midst of temptation, inquired\naffectionately after his uncle's health, was much interested to know\nwhether his lively cousin who used to be his playmate had grown up as\nhandsome as she promised to be, and announced his intention of paying\nhis respects to them both at Rockland. Not long after this came the\ntrunks marked R. V. which he had sent before him, forerunners of his\nadvent: he was not going to wait for a reply or an invitation.\n\nWhat a sound that is,--the banging down of the preliminary trunk,\nwithout its claimant to give it the life which is borrowed by all\npersonal appendages, so long as the owner's hand or eye is on them! If\nit announce the coming of one loved and longed for, how we delight to\nlook at it, to sit down on it, to caress it in our fancies, as a lone\nexile walking out on a windy pier yearns towards the merchantman lying\nalongside, with the colors of his own native land at her peak, and the\nname of the port he sailed from long ago upon her stern! But if it tell\nthe near approach of the undesired, inevitable guest, what sound short\nof the muffled noises made by the undertakers as they turn the corners\nin the dim-lighted house, with low shuffle of feet and whispered\ncautions, carries such a sense of knocking-kneed collapse with it as the\nthumping down in the front entry of the heavy portmanteau, rammed with\nthe changes of uncounted coming weeks?\n\nWhether the R. V. portmanteaus brought one or the other of these\nemotions to the tenants of the Dudley mansion, it might not be easy\nto settle. Elsie professed to be pleased with the thought of having an\nadventurous young stranger, with stories to tell, an inmate of their\nquiet, not to say dull, family. Under almost any other circumstances,\nher father would have been unwilling to take a young fellow of whom he\nknew so little under his roof; but this was his nephew, and anything\nthat seemed like to amuse or please Elsie was agreeable to him. He had\ngrown almost desperate, and felt as if any change in the current of her\nlife and feelings might save her from some strange paroxysm of dangerous\nmental exaltation or sullen perversion of disposition, from which some\nfearful calamity might come to herself or others.\n\nDick had been several weeks at the Dudley mansion. A few days before, he\nhad made a sudden dash for the nearest large city,--and when the Doctor\nmet him, he was just returning from his visit.\n\nIt had been a curious meeting between the two young persons, who had\nparted so young and after such strange relations with each other. When\nDick first presented himself at the mansion, not one in the house would\nhave known him for the boy who had left them all so suddenly years ago.\nHe was so dark, partly from his descent, partly from long habits of\nexposure, that Elsie looked almost fair beside him. He had something of\nthe family beauty which belonged to his cousin, but his eye had a fierce\npassion in it, very unlike the cold glitter of Elsie's. Like many people\nof strong and imperious temper, he was soft-voiced and very gentle in\nhis address, when he had no special reason for being otherwise. He soon\nfound reasons enough to be as amiable as he could force himself to be\nwith his uncle and his cousin. Elsie was to his fancy. She had a strange\nattraction for him, quite unlike anything he had ever known in other\nwomen. There was something, too, in early associations: when those who\nparted as children meet as man and woman, there is always a renewal\nof that early experience which followed the taste of the forbidden\nfruit,--a natural blush of consciousness, not without its charm.\n\nNothing could be more becoming than the behavior of \u00e2\u0080\u009cRichard Venner,\nEsquire, the guest of Dudley Venner, Esquire, at his noble mansion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as\nhe was announced in the Court column of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cRockland Weekly Universe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n He was pleased to find himself treated with kindness and attention as a\nrelative. He made himself very agreeable by abundant details concerning\nthe religious, political, social, commercial, and educational progress\nof the South American cities and states. He was himself much interested\nin everything that was going on about the Dudley mansion, walked all\nover it, noticed its valuable wood-lots with special approbation, was\ndelighted with the grand old house and its furniture, and would not be\neasy until he had seen all the family silver and heard its history. In\nreturn, he had much to tell of his father, now dead,--the only one of\nthe Venners, beside themselves, in whose fate his uncle was interested.\nWith Elsie, he was subdued and almost tender in his manner; with the few\nvisitors whom they saw, shy and silent,--perhaps a little watchful, if\nany young man happened to be among them.\n\nYoung fellows placed on their good behavior are apt to get restless and\nnervous, all ready to fly off into some mischief or other. Dick Venner\nhad his half-tamed horse with him to work off his suppressed life with.\nWhen the savage passion of his young blood came over him, he would fetch\nout the mustang, screaming and kicking as these amiable beasts are wont\nto do, strap the Spanish saddle tight to his back, vault into it, and,\nafter getting away from the village, strike the long spurs into his\nsides and whirl away in a wild gallop, until the black horse was flecked\nwith white foam, and the cruel steel points were red with his blood.\nWhen horse and rider were alike fired, he would fling the bridle on his\nneck and saunter homeward, always contriving to get to the stable in a\nquiet way, and coming into the house as calm as a bishop after a sober\ntrot on his steady-going cob.\n\nAfter a few weeks of this kind of life, he began to want some more\nfierce excitement. He had tried making downright love to Elsie, with no\ngreat success as yet, in his own opinion. The girl was capricious in her\ntreatment of him, sometimes scowling and repellent, sometimes familiar,\nvery often, as she used to be of old, teasing and malicious. All this,\nperhaps, made her more interesting to a young man who was tired of easy\nconquests. There was a strange fascination in her eyes, too, which at\ntimes was quite irresistible, so that he would feel himself drawn to\nher by a power which seemed to take away his will for the moment. It may\nhave been nothing but the common charm of bright eyes; but he had never\nbefore experienced the same kind of attraction.\n\nPerhaps she was not so very different from what she had been as a child,\nafter all. At any rate, so it seemed to Dick Venner, who, as was said\nbefore, had tried making love to her. They were sitting alone in the\nstudy one day; Elsie had round her neck that somewhat peculiar ornament,\nthe golden torque, which she had worn to the great party. Youth is\nadventurous and very curious about necklaces, brooches, chains, and\nother such adornments, so long as they are worn by young persons of\nthe female sex. Dick was seized with a great passion for examining this\ncurious chain, and, after some preliminary questions, was rash enough\nto lean towards her and put out his hand toward the neck that lay in the\ngolden coil.\n\nShe threw her head back, her eyes narrowing and her forehead drawing\ndown so that Dick thought her head actually flattened itself. He started\ninvoluntarily; for she looked so like the little girl who had struck him\nwith those sharp flashing teeth, that the whole scene came back, and he\nfelt the stroke again as if it had just been given, and the two white\nscars began to sting as they did after the old Doctor had burned them\nwith that stick of gray caustic, which looked so like a slate pencil,\nand felt so much like the end of a red-hot poker.\n\nIt took something more than a gallop to set him right after this. The\nnext day he mentioned having received a letter from a mercantile agent\nwith whom he had dealings. What his business was is, perhaps, none of\nour business. At any rate, it required him to go at once to the city\nwhere his correspondent resided.\n\nIndependently of this \u00e2\u0080\u009cbusiness\u00e2\u0080\u009d which called him, there may have been\nother motives, such as have been hinted at. People who have been living\nfor a long time in dreary country-places, without any emotion beyond\nsuch as are occasioned by a trivial pleasure or annoyance, often get\ncrazy at last for a vital paroxysm of some kind or other. In this state\nthey rush to the great cities for a plunge into their turbid life-baths,\nwith a frantic thirst for every exciting pleasure, which makes them\nthe willing and easy victims of all those who sell the Devil's wares on\ncommission. The less intelligent and instructed class of unfortunates,\nwho venture with their ignorance and their instincts into what is\nsometimes called the \u00e2\u0080\u009clife\u00e2\u0080\u009d of great cities, are put through a rapid\ncourse of instruction which entitles them very commonly to a diploma\nfrom the police court. But they only illustrate the working of the same\ntendency in mankind at large which has been occasionally noticed in the\nsons of ministers and other eminently worthy people, by many ascribed\nto that intense congenital hatred for goodness which distinguishes human\nnature from that of the brute, but perhaps as readily accounted for by\nconsidering it as the yawning and stretching of a young soul cramped too\nlong in one moral posture.\n\nRichard Veneer was a young man of remarkable experience for his years.\nHe ran less risk, therefore, in exposing himself to the temptations and\ndangers of a great city than many older men, who, seeking the livelier\nscenes of excitement to be found in large towns as a relaxation after\nthe monotonous routine of family life, are too often taken advantage of\nand made the victims of their sentiments or their generous confidence\nin their fellow-creatures. Such was not his destiny. There was something\nabout him which looked as if he would not take bullying kindly. He had\nalso the advantage of being acquainted with most of those ingenious\ndevices by which the proverbial inconstancy of fortune is steadied to\nsomething more nearly approaching fixed laws, and the dangerous risks\nwhich have so often led young men to ruin and suicide are practically\nreduced to somewhat less than nothing. So that Mr. Richard Veneer worked\noff his nervous energies without any troublesome adventure, and\nwas ready to return to Rockland in less than a week, without having\nlightened the money-belt he wore round his body, or tarnished the long\nglittering knife he carried in his boot.\n\nDick had sent his trunk to the nearest town through which the railroad\nleading to the city passed. He rode off on his black horse and left him\nat the place where he took the cars. On arriving at the city station, he\ntook a coach and drove to one of the great hotels. Thither drove also\na sagacious-looking, middle-aged man, who entered his name as \u00e2\u0080\u009cW.\nThompson\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the book at the office immediately after that of \u00e2\u0080\u009cR.\nVenner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThompson\u00e2\u0080\u009d kept a carelessly observant eye upon Mr. Venner\nduring his stay at the hotel, and followed him to the cars when he left,\nlooking over his shoulder when he bought his ticket at the station, and\nseeing him fairly off without obtruding himself in any offensive way\nupon his attention. Mr. Thompson, known in other quarters as Detective\nPoliceman Terry, got very little by his trouble. Richard Venner did\nnot turn out to be the wife-poisoner, the defaulting cashier, the\nriver-pirate, or the great counterfeiter. He paid his hotel-bill as a\ngentleman should always do, if he has the money and can spare it. The\ndetective had probably overrated his own sagacity when he ventured\nto suspect Mr. Venner. He reported to his chief that there was a\nknowing-looking fellow he had been round after, but he rather guessed he\nwas nothing more than \u00e2\u0080\u009cone o' them Southern sportsmen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe poor fellows at the stable where Dick had left his horse had had\ntrouble enough with him. One of the ostlers was limping about with a\nlame leg, and another had lost a mouthful of his coat, which came very\nnear carrying a piece of his shoulder with it. When Mr. Venner came back\nfor his beast, he was as wild as if he had just been lassoed, screaming,\nkicking, rolling over to get rid of his saddle, and when his rider was\nat last mounted, jumping about in a way to dislodge any common horseman.\nTo all this Dick replied by sticking his long spurs deeper and deeper\ninto his flanks, until the creature found he was mastered, and dashed\noff as if all the thistles of the Pampas were pricking him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne more gallop, Juan?\u00e2\u0080\u009d This was in the last mile of the road before he\ncame to the town which brought him in sight of the mansion-house. It was\nin this last gallop that the fiery mustang and his rider flashed by the\nold Doctor. Cassia pointed her sharp ears and shied to let them pass.\nThe Doctor turned and looked through the little round glass in the back\nof his sulky.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDick Turpin, there, will find more than his match!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. THE APOLLINEAN INSTITUTE. (With Extracts from the \u00e2\u0080\u009cReport\nof the committee.\u00e2\u0080\u009d)\n\nThe readers of this narrative will hardly expect any elaborate details\nof the educational management of the Apollinean Institute. They cannot\nbe supposed to take the same interest in its affairs as was shown by\nthe Annual Committees who reported upon its condition and prospects. As\nthese Committees were, however, an important part of the mechanism of\nthe establishment, some general account of their organization and a few\nextracts from the Report of the one last appointed may not be out of\nplace.\n\nWhether Mr. Silas Peckham had some contrivance for packing his\nCommittees, whether they happened always to be made up of optimists by\nnature, whether they were cajoled into good-humor by polite attentions,\nor whether they were always really delighted with the wonderful\nacquirements of the pupils and the admirable order of the school, it is\ncertain that their Annual Reports were couched in language which might\nwarm the heart of the most cold-blooded and calculating father that ever\nhad a family of daughters to educate. In fact, these Annual Reports were\nconsidered by Mr. Peckham as his most effective advertisements.\n\nThe first thing, therefore, was to see that the Committee was made up of\npersons known to the public.\n\nSome worn-out politician, in that leisurely and amiable transition-state\nwhich comes between official extinction and the paralysis which will\nfinish him as soon as his brain gets a little softer, made an admirable\nChairman for Mr. Peckham, when he had the luck to pick up such an\narticle. Old reputations, like old fashions, are more prized in the\ngrassy than in the stony districts. An effete celebrity, who would never\nbe heard of again in the great places until the funeral sermon waked up\nhis memory for one parting spasm, finds himself in full flavor of renown\na little farther back from the changing winds of the sea-coast. If such\na public character was not to be had, so that there was no chance of\nheading the Report with the name of the Honorable Mr. Somebody, the next\nbest thing was to get the Reverend Dr. Somebody to take that conspicuous\nposition. Then would follow two or three local worthies with Esquire\nafter their names. If any stray literary personage from one of the great\ncities happened to be within reach, he was pounced upon by Mr. Silas\nPeckham. It was a hard case for the poor man, who had travelled a\nhundred miles or two to the outside suburbs after peace and unwatered\nmilk, to be pumped for a speech in this unexpected way. It was harder\nstill, if he had been induced to venture a few tremulous remarks, to be\nobliged to write them out for the \u00e2\u0080\u009cRockland Weekly Universe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with the\nchance of seeing them used as an advertising certificate as long as he\nlived, if he lived as long as the late Dr. Waterhouse did after giving\nhis certificate in favor of Whitwell's celebrated Cephalic Snuff.\n\nThe Report of the last Committee had been signed by the Honorable,\n___________late __________ of ___________, as Chairman. (It is with\nreluctance that the name and titles are left in blank; but our public\ncharacters are so familiarly known to the whole community that this\nreserve becomes necessary.) The other members of the Committee were the\nReverend Mr. Butters, of a neighboring town, who was to make the prayer\nbefore the Exercises of the Exhibition, and two or three notabilities\nof Rockland, with geoponic eyes, and glabrous, bumpless foreheads. A few\nextracts from the Report are subjoined:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Committee have great pleasure in recording their unanimous opinion,\nthat the Institution was never in so flourishing a condition....\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe health of the pupils is excellent; the admirable quality of food\nsupplied shows itself in their appearance; their blooming aspect excited\nthe admiration of the Committee, and bears testimony to the assiduity of\nthe excellent Matron.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c.... moral and religious condition most encouraging, which they cannot\nbut attribute to the personal efforts and instruction of the faithful\nPrincipal, who considers religious instruction a solemn duty which he\ncannot commit to other people.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c.... great progress in their studies, under the intelligent\nsuperintendence of the accomplished Principal, assisted by Mr. Badger,\n[Mr. Langdon's predecessor,] Miss Darley, the lady who superintends\nthe English branches, Miss Crabs, her assistant and teacher of Modern\nLanguages, and Mr. Schneider, teacher of French, German, Latin, and\nMusic....\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEducation is the great business of the Institute. Amusements are\nobjects of a secondary nature; but these are by no means neglected....\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c.... English compositions of great originality and beauty, creditable\nalike to the head and heart of their accomplished authors.... several\npoems of a very high order of merit, which would do honor to the\nliterature of any age or country.... life-like drawings, showing great\nproficiency.... Many converse fluently in various modern languages....\nperform the most difficult airs with the skill of professional\nmusicians....\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c.... advantages unsurpassed, if equalled by those of any Institution\nin the country, and reflecting the highest honor on the distinguished\nHead of the Establishment, SILAS PECKHAM, Esquire, and his admirable\nLady, the MATRON, with their worthy assistants....\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe perusal of this Report did Mr. Bernard more good than a week's\nvacation would have done: It gave him such a laugh as he had not had for\na month. The way in which Silas Peckham had made his Committee say what\nhe wanted them to--for he recognized a number of expressions in the\nReport as coming directly from the lips of his principal, and could not\nhelp thinking how cleverly he had forced his phrases, as jugglers do the\nparticular card they wish their dupe to take--struck him as particularly\nneat and pleasing.\n\nHe had passed through the sympathetic and emotional stages in his new\nexperience, and had arrived at the philosophical and practical state,\nwhich takes things coolly, and goes to work to set them right. He had\nbreadth enough of view to see that there was nothing so very exceptional\nin this educational trader's dealings with his subordinates, but he had\nalso manly feeling enough to attack the particular individual instance\nof wrong before him. There are plenty of dealer's in morals, as in\nordinary traffic, who confine themselves to wholesale business. They\nleave the small necessity of their next-door neighbor to the retailers,\nwho are poorer in statistics and general facts, but richer in the\nevery-day charities. Mr. Bernard felt, at first, as one does who sees a\ngray rat steal out of a drain and begin gnawing at the bark of some tree\nloaded with fruit or blossoms, which he will soon girdle, if he is let\nalone. The first impulse is to murder him with the nearest ragged stone.\nThen one remembers that he is a rodent, acting after the law of his\nkind, and cools down and is contented to drive him off and guard the\ntree against his teeth for the future. As soon as this is done, one can\nwatch his attempts at mischief with a certain amusement.\n\nThis was the kind of process Mr. Bernard had gone through. First, the\nindignant surprise of a generous nature, when it comes unexpectedly into\nrelations with a mean one. Then the impulse of extermination,--a divine\ninstinct, intended to keep down vermin of all classes to their\nworking averages in the economy of Nature. Then a return of cheerful\ntolerance,--a feeling, that, if the Deity could bear with rats and\nsharpers, he could; with a confident trust, that, in the long run,\nterriers and honest men would have the upperhand, and a grateful\nconsciousness that he had been sent just at the right time to come\nbetween a patient victim and the master who held her in peonage.\n\nHaving once made up his mind what to do, Mr. Bernard was as good-natured\nand hopeful as ever. He had the great advantage, from his professional\ntraining, of knowing how to recognize and deal with the nervous\ndisturbances to which overtasked women are so liable. He saw well enough\nthat Helen Darley would certainly kill herself or lose her wits, if he\ncould not lighten her labors and lift off a large part of her weight\nof cares. The worst of it was, that she was one of those women who\nnaturally overwork themselves, like those horses who will go at the top\nof their pace until they drop. Such women are dreadfully unmanageable.\nIt is as hard reasoning with them as it would have been reasoning with\nIo, when she was flying over land and sea, driven by the sting of the\nnever-sleeping gadfly.\n\nThis was a delicate, interesting game that he played. Under one innocent\npretext or another, he invaded this or that special province she had\nmade her own. He would collect the themes and have them all read and\nmarked, answer all the puzzling questions in mathematics, make the other\nteachers come to him for directions, and in this way gradually took upon\nhimself not only all the general superintendence that belonged to his\noffice, but stole away so many of the special duties which might fairly\nhave belonged to his assistant, that, before she knew it, she was\nlooking better and feeling more cheerful than for many and many a month\nbefore.\n\nWhen the nervous energy is depressed by any bodily cause, or\nexhausted by overworking, there follow effects which have often\nbeen misinterpreted by moralists, and especially by theologians. The\nconscience itself becomes neuralgic, sometimes actually inflamed, so\nthat the least touch is agony. Of all liars and false accusers, a\nsick conscience is the most inventive and indefatigable. The devoted\ndaughter, wife, mother, whose life has been given to unselfish labors,\nwho has filled a place which it seems to others only an angel would\nmake good, reproaches herself with incompetence and neglect of duty. The\nhumble Christian, who has been a model to others, calls himself a worm\nof the dust on one page of his diary, and arraigns himself on the next\nfor coming short of the perfection of an archangel.\n\nConscience itself requires a conscience, or nothing can be more\nunscrupulous. It told Saul that he did well in persecuting the\nChristians. It has goaded countless multitudes of various creeds to\nendless forms of self-torture. The cities of India are full of cripples\nit has made. The hill-sides of Syria are riddled with holes, where\nmiserable hermits, whose lives it had palsied, lived and died like the\nvermin they harbored. Our libraries are crammed with books written by\nspiritual hypochondriacs, who inspected all their moral secretions\na dozen times a day. They are full of interest, but they should be\ntransferred from the shelf of the theologian to that of the medical man\nwho makes a study of insanity.\n\nThis was the state into which too much work and too much responsibility\nwere bringing Helen Darley, when the new master came and lifted so much\nof the burden that was crushing her as must be removed before she could\nhave a chance to recover her natural elasticity and buoyancy. Many\nof the noblest women, suffering like her, but less fortunate in being\nrelieved at the right moment, die worried out of life by the perpetual\nteasing of this inflamed, neuralgic conscience. So subtile is the line\nwhich separates the true and almost angelic sensibility of a healthy,\nbut exalted nature, from the soreness of a soul which is sympathizing\nwith a morbid state of the body that it is no wonder they are often\nconfounded. And thus many good women are suffered to perish by that form\nof spontaneous combustion in which the victim goes on toiling day and\nnight with the hidden fire consuming her, until all at once her cheek\nwhitens, and, as we look upon her, she drops away, a heap of ashes. The\nmore they overwork themselves, the more exacting becomes the sense of\nduty,--as the draught of the locomotive's furnace blows stronger and\nmakes the fire burn more fiercely, the faster it spins along the track.\n\nIt is not very likely, as was said at the beginning of this chapter,\nthat we shall trouble ourselves a great deal about the internal affairs\nof the Apollinean Institute. These schools are, in the nature of things,\nnot so very unlike each other as to require a minute description for\neach particular one among them. They have all very much the same general\nfeatures, pleasing and displeasing. All feeding-establishments have\nsomething odious about them,--from the wretched country-houses where\npaupers are farmed out to the lowest bidder, up to the commons-tables\nat colleges and even the fashionable boarding-house. A person's appetite\nshould be at war with no other purse than his own. Young people,\nespecially, who have a bone-factory at work in them, and have to feed\nthe living looms of innumerable growing tissues, should be provided\nfor, if possible, by those who love them like their own flesh and blood.\nElsewhere their appetites will be sure to make them enemies, or, what\nare almost as bad, friends whose interests are at variance with the\nclaims of their exacting necessities and demands.\n\nBesides, all commercial transactions in regard to the most sacred\ninterests of life are hateful even to those who profit by them. The\nclergyman, the physician, the teacher, must be paid; but each of them,\nif his duty be performed in the true spirit, can hardly help a shiver\nof disgust when money is counted out to him for administering the\nconsolations of religion, for saving some precious life, for sowing the\nseeds of Christian civilization in young ingenuous souls.\n\nAnd yet all these schools, with their provincial French and their\nmechanical accomplishments, with their cheap parade of diplomas and\ncommencements and other public honors, have an ever fresh interest to\nall who see the task they are performing in our new social order. These\ngirls are not being educated for governesses, or to be exported, with\nother manufactured articles, to colonies where there happens to be a\nsurplus of males. Most of them will be wives, and every American-born\nhusband is a possible President of these United States. Any one of these\ngirls may be a four-years' queen. There is no sphere of human activity\nso exalted that she may not be called upon to fill it.\n\nBut there is another consideration of far higher interest. The education\nof our community to all that is beautiful is flowing in mainly through\nits women, and that to a considerable extent by the aid of these large\nestablishments, the least perfect of which do something to stimulate the\nhigher tastes and partially instruct them. Sometimes there is, perhaps,\nreason to fear that girls will be too highly educated for their own\nhappiness, if they are lifted by their culture out of the range of the\npractical and every-day working youth by whom they are surrounded. But\nthis is a risk we must take. Our young men come into active life so\nearly, that, if our girls were not educated to something beyond mere\npractical duties, our material prosperity would outstrip our culture; as\nit often does in large places where money is made too rapidly. This is\nthe meaning, therefore, of that somewhat ambitious programme common to\nmost of these large institutions, at which we sometimes smile, perhaps\nunwisely or uncharitably.\n\nWe shall take it for granted that the routine of instruction went on at\nthe Apollinean Institute much as it does in other schools of the same\nclass. People, young or old, are wonderfully different, if we contrast\nextremes in pairs. They approach much nearer, if we take them in groups\nof twenty. Take two separate hundreds as they come, without choosing,\nand you get the gamut of human character in both so completely that you\ncan strike many chords in each which shall be in perfect unison with\ncorresponding ones in the other. If we go a step farther, and compare\nthe population of two villages of the same race and region, there is\nsuch a regularly graduated distribution and parallelism of character,\nthat it seems as if Nature must turn out human beings in sets like\nchessmen.\n\nIt must be confessed that the position in which Mr. Bernard now found\nhimself had a pleasing danger about it which might well justify all the\nfears entertained on his account by more experienced friends, when they\nlearned that he was engaged in a Young Ladies' Seminary. The school\nnever went on more smoothly than during the first period of his\nadministration, after he had arranged its duties, and taken his share,\nand even more than his share, upon himself. But human nature does not\nwait for the diploma of the Apollinean Institute to claim the exercise\nof it, instincts and faculties. These young girls saw but little of\nthe youth of the neighborhood. The mansion-house young men were off at\ncollege or in the cities, or making love to each other's sisters, or\nat any rate unavailable for some reason or other. There were a few\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cclerks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--that is, young men who attended shops, commonly called\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cstores,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--who were fond of walking by the Institute, when they were off\nduty, for the sake of exchanging a word or a glance with any one of\nthe young ladies they might happen to know, if any such were stirring\nabroad: crude young men, mostly, with a great many \u00e2\u0080\u009cSirs\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cMa'ams\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n in their speech, and with that style of address sometimes acquired in\nthe retail business, as if the salesman were recommending himself to\na customer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst-rate family article, Ma'am; warranted to wear a\nlifetime; just one yard and three quarters in this pattern, Ma'am;\nsha'n't I have the pleasure?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and so forth. If there had been ever so\nmany of them, and if they had been ever so fascinating, the quarantine\nof the Institute was too rigorous to allow any romantic infection to be\nintroduced from without.\n\nAnybody might see what would happen, with a good-looking, well-dressed,\nwell-bred young man, who had the authority of a master, it is true, but\nthe manners of a friend and equal, moving about among these young girls\nday after day, his eyes meeting theirs, his breath mingling with theirs,\nhis voice growing familiar to them, never in any harsh tones, often\nsoothing, encouraging, always sympathetic, with its male depth and\nbreadth of sound among the chorus of trebles, as if it were a river in\nwhich a hundred of these little piping streamlets-might lose themselves;\nanybody might see what would happen. Young girls wrote home to their\nparents that they enjoyed themselves much, this term, at the Institute,\nand thought they were making rapid progress in their studies. There was\na great enthusiasm for the young master's reading-classes in English\npoetry. Some of the poor little things began to adorn themselves with an\nextra ribbon, or a bit of such jewelry as they had before kept for great\noccasions. Dear souls! they only half knew what they were doing it for.\nDoes the bird know why its feathers grow more brilliant and its voice\nbecomes musical in the pairing season?\n\nAnd so, in the midst of this quiet inland town, where a mere accident\nhad placed Mr. Bernard Langdon, there was a concentration of explosive\nmaterials which might at any time change its Arcadian and academic\nrepose into a scene of dangerous commotion. What said Helen Darley, when\nshe saw with her woman's glance that more than one girl, when she should\nbe looking at her book, was looking over it toward the master's desk?\nWas her own heart warmed by any livelier feeling than gratitude, as its\nlife began to flow with fuller pulses, and the morning sky again looked\nbright and the flowers recovered their lost fragrance? Was there any\nstrange, mysterious affinity between the master and the dark girl who\nsat by herself? Could she call him at will by looking at him? Could it\nbe that--? It made her shiver to think of it.--And who was that strange\nhorseman who passed Mr. Bernard at dusk the other evening, looking\nso like Mephistopheles galloping hard to be in season at the witches'\nSabbath-gathering? That must be the cousin of Elsie's who wants to marry\nher, they say. A dangerous-looking fellow for a rival, if one took a\nfancy to the dark girl! And who is she, and what?--by what demon is she\nhaunted, by what taint is she blighted, by what curse is she followed,\nby what destiny is she marked, that her strange beauty has such a terror\nin it, and that hardly one shall dare to love her, and her eye glitters\nalways, but warms for none?\n\nSome of these questions are ours. Some were Helen Darley's. Some of them\nmingled with the dreams of Bernard Langdon, as he slept the night after\nmeeting the strange horseman. In the morning he happened to be a little\nlate in entering the schoolroom. There was something between the leaves\nof the Virgil which lay upon his desk. He opened it and saw a\nfreshly gathered mountain-flower. He looked at Elsie, instinctively,\ninvoluntarily. She had another such flower on her breast.\n\nA young girl's graceful compliment,--that is all,--no doubt,--no doubt.\nIt was odd that the flower should have happened to be laid between the\nleaves of the Fourth Book of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAEneid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and at this line,\n\n          \u00e2\u0080\u009cIncipit effari, mediaque in voce resistit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA remembrance of an ancient superstition flashed through the master's\nmind, and he determined to try the Sortes Virgilianae. He shut the\nvolume, and opened it again at a venture.--The story of Laocoon!\n\nHe read with a strange feeling of unwilling fascination, from \u00e2\u0080\u009cHorresco\nreferees\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009cBis medium amplexi,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and flung the book from him, as if\nits leaves had been steeped in the subtle poisons that princes die of.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. CURIOSITY.\n\nPeople will talk. 'Ciascun lo dice' is a tune that is played oftener\nthan the national air of this country or any other.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat 's what they say. Means to marry her, if she is his cousin. Got\nmoney himself,--that 's the story,--but wants to come and live in the\nold place, and get the Dudley property by and by.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cMother's folks was\nwealthy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cTwenty-three to twenty-five year old.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe a'n't more 'n\ntwenty, or twenty-one at the outside.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cLooks as if he knew too much\nto be only twenty year old.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGuess he's been through the mill,--don't\nlook so green, anyhow, hey? Did y' ever mind that cut over his left\neyebrow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo they gossiped in Rockland. The young fellows could make nothing of\nDick Venner. He was shy and proud with the few who made advances to him.\nThe young ladies called him handsome and romantic, but he looked at them\nlike a many-tailed pacha who was in the habit of, ordering his wives by\nthe dozen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you think of the young man over there at the Veneers'?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nMiss Arabella Thornton to her father.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHandsome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Judge, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut dangerous-looking. His face is\nindictable at common law. Do you know, my dear, I think there is a blank\nat the Sheriff's office, with a place for his name in it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Judge paused and looked grave, as if he had just listened to the\nverdict of the jury and was going to pronounce sentence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you heard anything against him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Judge's daughter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing. But I don't like these mixed bloods and half-told stories.\nBesides, I have seen a good many desperate fellows at the bar, and I\nhave a fancy they all have a look belonging to them. The worst one I\never sentenced looked a good deal like this fellow. A wicked mouth. All\nour other features are made for us; but a man makes his own mouth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho was the person you sentenced?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was a young fellow that undertook to garrote a man who had won his\nmoney at cards. The same slender shape, the same cunning, fierce\nlook, smoothed over with a plausible air. Depend upon it, there is an\nexpression in all the sort of people who live by their wits when\nthey can, and by worse weapons when their wits fail them, that we old\nlaw-doctors know just as well as the medical counsellors know the marks\nof disease in a man's face. Dr. Kittredge looks at a man and says he is\ngoing to die; I look at another man and say he is going to be hanged, if\nnothing happens. I don't say so of this one, but I don't like his looks.\nI wonder Dudley Veneer takes to him so kindly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's all for Elsie's sake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miss Thornton. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel quite sure of\nthat. He never does anything that is not meant for her in some way. I\nsuppose it amuses her to have her cousin about the house. She rides a\ngood deal since he has been here. Have you seen them galloping about\ntogether? He looks like my idea of a Spanish bandit on that wild horse\nof his.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPossibly he has been one,--or is one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Judge,--smiling as men\nsmile whose lips have often been freighted with the life and death of\ntheir fellow-creatures. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI met them riding the other day. Perhaps Dudley\nis right, if it pleases her to have a companion. What will happen,\nthough, if he makes love to her? Will Elsie be easily taken with such\na fellow? You young folks are supposed to know more about these matters\nthan we middle-aged people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody can tell. Elsie is not like anybody else. The girls who have\nseen most of her think she hates men, all but 'Dudley,' as she calls her\nfather. Some of them doubt whether she loves him. They doubt whether\nshe can love anything human, except perhaps the old black woman who\nhas taken care of her since she was a baby. The village people have the\nstrangest stories about her; you know what they call her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe whispered three words in her father's ear. The Judge changed color\nas she spoke, sighed deeply, and was silent as if lost in thought for a\nmoment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI remember her mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cso well! A sweeter creature never\nlived. Elsie has something of her in her look, but those are not her\nmother's eyes. They were dark, but soft, as in all I ever saw of her\nrace. Her father's are dark too, but mild, and even tender, I should\nsay. I don't know what there is about Elsie's,--but do you know, my\ndear, I find myself curiously influenced by them? I have had to face a\ngood many sharp eyes and hard ones,--murderers' eyes and pirates',--men\nwho had to be watched in the bar, where they stood on trial, for fear\nthey should spring on the prosecuting officers like tigers,--but I never\nsaw such eyes as Elsie's; and yet they have a kind of drawing virtue\nor power about them,--I don't know what else to call it: have you never\nobserved this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis daughter smiled in her turn.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever observed it? Why, of course, nobody could be with Elsie Venner\nand not observe it. There are a good many other strange things about\nher: did you ever notice how she dresses?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, handsomely enough, I should think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Judge answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose\nshe dresses as she likes, and sends to the city for what she wants. What\ndo you mean in particular? We men notice effects in dress, but not much\nin detail.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou never noticed the colors and patterns of her dresses? You never\nremarked anything curious about her ornaments? Well! I don't believe you\nmen know, half the time, whether a lady wears a nine-penny collar or a\nthread-lace cape worth a thousand dollars. I don't believe you know a\nsilk dress from a bombazine one. I don't believe you can tell whether\na woman is in black or in colors, unless you happen to know she is a\nwidow. Elsie Venner has a strange taste in dress, let me tell you. She\nsends for the oddest patterns of stuffs, and picks out the most curious\nthings at the jeweller's, whenever she goes to town with her father.\nThey say the old Doctor tells him to let her have her way about such\nmatters. Afraid of her mind, if she is contradicted, I suppose. You've\nheard about her going to school at that place,--the 'Institoot,' as\nthose people call it? They say she's bright enough in her way,--has\nstudied at home, you know, with her father a good deal, knows some\nmodern languages and Latin, I believe: at any rate, she would have\nit so,--she must go to the 'Institoot.' They have a very good female\nteacher there, I hear; and the new master, that young Mr. Langdon, looks\nand talks like a well-educated young man. I wonder what they 'll make of\nElsie, between them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo they talked at the Judge's, in the calm, judicial-looking\nmansion-house, in the grave, still library, with the troops of wan-hued\nlaw-books staring blindly out of their titles at them as they talked,\nlike the ghosts of dead attorneys fixed motionless and speechless, each\nwith a thin, golden film over his unwinking eyes.\n\nIn the mean time, everything went on quietly enough after Cousin\nRichard's return. A man of sense,--that is, a man who knows perfectly\nwell that a cool head is worth a dozen warm hearts in carrying the\nfortress of a woman's affections, (not yours, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAstarte,\u00e2\u0080\u009d nor yours,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cViola,\u00e2\u0080\u009d)--who knows that men are rejected by women every day because\nthey, the men, love them, and are accepted every day because they do\nnot, and therefore can study the arts of pleasing,--a man of sense,\nwhen he finds he has established his second parallel too soon, retires\nquietly to his first, and begins working on his covered ways again.\nThe whole art of love may be read in any Encyclopaedia under the title\nFortification, where the terms just used are explained. After the little\nadventure of the necklace, Dick retreated at once to his first parallel.\nElsie loved riding,--and would go off with him on a gallop now and then.\nHe was a master of all those strange Indian horseback-feats which shame\nthe tricks of the circus-riders, and used to astonish and almost amuse\nher sometimes by disappearing from his saddle, like a phantom horseman\nlying flat against the side of the bounding creature that bore him, as\nif he were a hunting leopard with his claws in the horse's flank and\nflattening himself out against his heaving ribs. Elsie knew a little\nSpanish too, which she had learned from the young person who had taught\nher dancing, and Dick enlarged her vocabulary with a few soft\nphrases, and would sing her a song sometimes, touching the air upon an\nancient-looking guitar they had found with the ghostly things in the\ngarret,--a quaint old instrument, marked E. M. on the back, and supposed\nto have belonged to a certain Elizabeth Mascarene, before mentioned in\nconnection with a work of art,--a fair, dowerless lady, who smiled and\nsung and faded away, unwedded, a hundred years ago, as dowerless ladies,\nnot a few, are smiling and singing and fading now,--God grant each of\nthem His love,--and one human heart as its interpreter!\n\nAs for school, Elsie went or stayed away as she liked. Sometimes, when\nthey thought she was at her desk in the great schoolroom, she would\nbe on The Mountain,--alone always. Dick wanted to go with her, but\nshe would never let him. Once, when she had followed the zigzag path\na little way up, she looked back and caught a glimpse of him following\nher. She turned and passed him without a word, but giving him a look\nwhich seemed to make the scars on his wrist tingle, went to her room,\nwhere she locked herself up, and did not come out again till evening,\nOld Sophy having brought her food, and set it down, not speaking, but\nlooking into her eyes inquiringly, like a dumb beast trying to feel\nout his master's will in his face. The evening was clear and the\nmoon shining. As Dick sat at his chamber-window, looking at the\nmountain-side, he saw a gray-dressed figure flit between the trees\nand steal along the narrow path which led upward. Elsie's pillow was\nunpressed that night, but she had not been missed by the household,--for\nDick knew enough to keep his own counsel. The next morning she avoided\nhim and went off early to school. It was the same morning that the young\nmaster found the flower between the leaves of his Virgil.\n\nThe girl got over her angry fit, and was pleasant enough with her cousin\nfor a few days after this; but she shunned rather than sought him.\nShe had taken a new interest in her books, and especially in certain\npoetical readings which the master conducted with the elder scholars.\nThis gave Master Langdon a good chance to study her ways when her eye\nwas on her book, to notice the inflections of her voice, to watch for\nany expression of her sentiments; for, to tell the truth, he had a\nkind of fear that the girl had taken a fancy to him, and, though she\ninterested him, he did not wish to study her heart from the inside.\n\nThe more he saw her, the more the sadness of her beauty wrought upon\nhim. She looked as if she might hate, but could not love. She hardly\nsmiled at anything, spoke rarely, but seemed to feel that her natural\npower of expression lay all in her bright eyes, the force of which so\nmany had felt, but none perhaps had tried to explain to themselves. A\nperson accustomed to watch the faces of those who were ailing in body or\nmind, and to search in every line and tint for some underlying source\nof disorder, could hardly help analyzing the impression such a face\nproduced upon him. The light of those beautiful eyes was like the lustre\nof ice; in all her features there was nothing of that human warmth which\nshows that sympathy has reached the soul beneath the mask of flesh it\nwears. The look was that of remoteness, of utter isolation. There was\nin its stony apathy, it seemed to him, the pathos which we find in the\nblind who show no film or speck over the organs of sight; for Nature\nhad meant her to be lovely, and left out nothing but love. And yet the\nmaster could not help feeling that some instinct was working in this\ngirl which was in some way leading her to seek his presence. She did not\nlift her glittering eyes upon him as at first. It seemed strange that\nshe did not, for they were surely her natural weapons of conquest. Her\ncolor did not come and go like that of young girls under excitement. She\nhad a clear brunette complexion, a little sun-touched, it may be,--for\nthe master noticed once, when her necklace was slightly displaced, that\na faint ring or band of a little lighter shade than the rest of the\nsurface encircled her neck. What was the slight peculiarity of her\nenunciation, when she read? Not a lisp, certainly, but the least\npossible imperfection in articulating some of the lingual sounds,--just\nenough to be noticed at first, and quite forgotten after being a few\ntimes heard.\n\nNot a word about the flower on either side. It was not uncommon for\nthe schoolgirls to leave a rose or pink or wild flower on the teacher's\ndesk. Finding it in the Virgil was nothing, after all; it was a little\ndelicate flower, which looked as if it were made to press, and it was\nprobably shut in by accident at the particular place where he found it.\nHe took it into his head to examine it in a botanical point of view. He\nfound it was not common,--that it grew only in certain localities,--and\nthat one of these was among the rocks of the eastern spur of The\nMountain.\n\nIt happened to come into his head how the Swiss youth climb the sides\nof the Alps to find the flower called the Edelweiss for the maidens\nwhom they wish to please. It is a pretty fancy, that of scaling some\ndangerous height before the dawn, so as to gather the flower in its\nfreshness, that the favored maiden may wear it to church on Sunday\nmorning, a proof at once of her lover's devotion and his courage. Mr.\nBernard determined to explore the region where this flower was said to\ngrow, that he might see where the wild girl sought the blossoms of which\nNature was so jealous.\n\nIt was on a warm, fair Saturday afternoon that he undertook his\nland-voyage of discovery. He had more curiosity, it may be, than he\nwould have owned; for he had heard of the girl's wandering habits, and\nthe guesses about her sylvan haunts, and was thinking what the chances\nwere that he should meet her in some strange place, or come upon traces\nof her which would tell secrets she would not care to have known.\n\nThe woods are all alive to one who walks through them with his mind in\nan excited state, and his eyes and ears wide open. The trees are always\ntalking, not merely whispering with their leaves, (for every tree talks\nto itself in that way, even when it stands alone in the middle of\na pasture,) but grating their boughs against each other, as old\nhorn-handed farmers press their dry, rustling palms together, dropping\na nut or a leaf or a twig, clicking to the tap of a woodpecker, or\nrustling as a squirrel flashes along a branch. It was now the season of\nsinging-birds, and the woods were haunted with mysterious, tender music.\nThe voices of the birds which love the deeper shades of the forest are\nsadder than those of the open fields: these are the nuns who have taken\nthe veil, the hermits that have hidden themselves away from the\nworld and tell their griefs to the infinite listening Silences of the\nwilderness,--for the one deep inner silence that Nature breaks with her\nfitful superficial sounds becomes multiplied as the image of a star in\nruffled waters. Strange! The woods at first convey the impression of\nprofound repose, and yet, if you watch their ways with open ear, you\nfind the life which is in them is restless and nervous as that of a\nwoman: the little twigs are crossing and twining and separating like\nslender fingers that cannot be still; the stray leaf is to be flattened\ninto its place like a truant curl; the limbs sway and twist, impatient\nof their constrained attitude; and the rounded masses of foliage swell\nupward and subside from time to time with long soft sighs, and, it may\nbe, the falling of a few rain-drops which had lain hidden among the\ndeeper shadows. I pray you, notice, in the sweet summer days which will\nsoon see you among the mountains, this inward tranquillity that belongs\nto the heart of the woodland, with this nervousness, for I do not know\nwhat else to call it, of outer movement. One would say, that Nature,\nlike untrained persons, could not sit still without nestling about or\ndoing something with her limbs or features, and that high breeding was\nonly to be looked for in trim gardens, where the soul of the trees\nis ill at ease perhaps, but their manners are unexceptionable, and a\nrustling branch or leaf falling out of season is an indecorum. The real\nforest is hardly still except in the Indian summer; then there is death\nin the house, and they are waiting for the sharp shrunken months to come\nwith white raiment for the summer's burial.\n\nThere were many hemlocks in this neighborhood, the grandest and most\nsolemn of all the forest-trees in the mountain regions. Up to a certain\nperiod of growth they are eminently beautiful, their boughs disposed in\nthe most graceful pagoda-like series of close terraces, thick and dark\nwith green crystalline leaflets. In spring the tender shoots come out of\na paler green, finger-like, as if they were pointing to the violets at\ntheir feet. But when the trees have grown old, and their rough boles\nmeasure a yard and more through their diameter, they are no longer\nbeautiful, but they have a sad solemnity all their own, too full of\nmeaning to require the heart's comment to be framed in words. Below, all\ntheir earthward-looking branches are sapless and shattered, splintered\nby the weight of many winters' snows; above, they are still green and\nfull of life, but their summits overtop all the deciduous trees around\nthem, and in their companionship with heaven they are alone. On these\nthe lightning loves to fall. One such Mr. Bernard saw,--or rather, what\nhad been one such; for the bolt had torn the tree like an explosion\nfrom within, and the ground was strewed all around the broken stump with\nflakes of rough bark and strips and chips of shivered wood, into\nwhich the old tree had been rent by the bursting rocket from the\nthunder-cloud.\n\n--The master had struck up The Mountain obliquely from the western side\nof the Dudley mansion-house. In this way he ascended until he reached a\npoint many hundred feet above the level of the plain, and commanding\nall the country beneath and around. Almost at his feet he saw the\nmansion-house, the chimney standing out of the middle of the roof, or\nrather, like a black square hole in it,--the trees almost directly over\ntheir stems, the fences as lines, the whole nearly as an architect\nwould draw a ground-plan of the house and the inclosures round it. It\nfrightened him to see how the huge masses of rock and old forest-growths\nhung over the home below. As he descended a little and drew near the\nledge of evil name, he was struck with the appearance of a long narrow\nfissure that ran parallel with it and above it for many rods, not\nseemingly of very old standing,--for there were many fibres of roots\nwhich had evidently been snapped asunder when the rent took place, and\nsome of which were still succulent in both separated portions.\n\nMr. Bernard had made up his mind, when he set forth, not to come back\nbefore he had examined the dreaded ledge. He had half persuaded himself\nthat it was scientific curiosity. He wished to examine the rocks, to\nsee what flowers grew there, and perhaps to pick up an adventure in\nthe zoological line; for he had on a pair of high, stout boots, and he\ncarried a stick in his hand, which was forked at one extremity, so as to\nbe very convenient to hold down a crotalus with, if he should happen to\nencounter one. He knew the aspect of the ledge from a distance; for its\nbald and leprous-looking declivities stood out in their nakedness from\nthe wooded sides of The Mountain, when this was viewed from certain\npoints of the village. But the nearer aspect of the blasted region had\nsomething frightful in it. The cliffs were water-worn, as if they had\nbeen gnawed for thousands of years by hungry waves. In some places they\noverhung their base so as to look like leaning towers which might topple\nover at any minute. In other parts they were scooped into niches or\ncaverns. Here and there they were cracked in deep fissures, some of them\nof such width that one might enter them, if he cared to run the risk of\nmeeting the regular tenants, who might treat him as an intruder.\n\nParts of the ledge were cloven perpendicularly, with nothing but cracks\nor slightly projecting edges in which or on which a foot could find\nhold. High up on one of these precipitous walls of rock he saw some\ntufts of flowers, and knew them at once for the same that he had found\nbetween the leaves of his Virgil. Not there, surely! No woman would have\nclung against that steep, rough parapet to gather an idle blossom. And\nyet the master looked round everywhere, and even up the side of that\nrock, to see if there were no signs of a woman's footstep. He peered\nabout curiously, as if his eye might fall on some of those fragments of\ndress which women leave after them, whenever they run against each other\nor against anything else,--in crowded ballrooms, in the brushwood after\npicnics, on the fences after rambles, scattered round over every place\nwhich has witnessed an act of violence, where rude hands have been laid\nupon them. Nothing--Stop, though, one moment. That stone is smooth and\npolished, as if it had been somewhat worn by the pressure of human feet.\nThere is one twig broken among the stems of that clump of shrubs. He put\nhis foot upon the stone and took hold of the close-clinging shrub. In\nthis way he turned a sharp angle of the rock and found himself on\na natural platform, which lay in front of one of the wider\nfissures,--whether the mouth of a cavern or not he could not yet tell.\nA flat stone made an easy seat, upon which he sat down, as he was\nvery glad to do, and looked mechanically about him. A small fragment\nsplintered from the rock was at his feet. He took it and threw it down\nthe declivity a little below where he sat. He looked about for a stem\nor a straw of some kind to bite upon,--a country-instinct,--relic, no\ndoubt, of the old vegetable-feeding habits of Eden. Is that a stem or a\nstraw? He picked it up. It was a hair-pin.\n\nTo say that Mr. Langdon had a strange sort of thrill shoot through him\nat the sight of this harmless little implement would be a statement not\nat variance with the fact of the case. That smooth stone had been often\ntrodden, and by what foot he could not doubt. He rose up from his seat\nto look round for other signs of a woman's visits. What if there is a\ncavern here, where she has a retreat, fitted up, perhaps, as anchorites\nfitted their cells,--nay, it may be, carpeted and mirrored, and with one\nof those tiger-skins for a couch, such as they, say the girl loves to\nlie on? Let us look, at any rate.\n\nMr. Bernard walked to the mouth of the cavern or fissure and looked into\nit. His look was met by the glitter of two diamond eyes, small, sharp,\ncold, shining out of the darkness, but gliding with a smooth, steady\nmotion towards the light, and himself. He stood fixed, struck dumb,\nstaring back into them with dilating pupils and sudden numbness of fear\nthat cannot move, as in the terror of dreams. The two sparks of light\ncame forward until they grew to circles of flame, and all at once lifted\nthemselves up as if in angry surprise. Then for the first time thrilled\nin Mr. Bernard's ears the dreadful sound that nothing which breathes, be\nit man or brute, can hear unmoved,--the long, loud, stinging whirr,\nas the huge, thick bodied reptile shook his many-jointed rattle and\nadjusted his loops for the fatal stroke. His eyes were drawn as with\nmagnets toward the circles of flame. His ears rung as in the overture\nto the swooning dream of chloroform. Nature was before man with her\nanaesthetics: the cat's first shake stupefies the mouse; the lion's\nfirst shake deadens the man's fear and feeling; and the crotalus\nparalyzes before he strikes. He waited as in a trance,--waited as one\nthat longs to have the blow fall, and all over, as the man who shall be\nin two pieces in a second waits for the axe to drop. But while he looked\nstraight into the flaming eyes, it seemed to him that they were losing\ntheir light and terror, that they were growing tame and dull; the charm\nwas dissolving, the numbness was passing away, he could move once more.\nHe heard a light breathing close to his ear, and, half turning, saw the\nface of Elsie Venner, looking motionless into the reptile's eyes, which\nhad shrunk and faded under the stronger enchantment of her own.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. FAMILY SECRETS.\n\nIt was commonly understood in the town of Rockland that Dudley Venner\nhad had a great deal of trouble with that daughter of his, so handsome,\nyet so peculiar, about whom there were so many strange stories. There\nwas no end to the tales which were told of her extraordinary doings.\nYet her name was never coupled with that of any youth or man, until this\ncousin had provoked remark by his visit; and even then it was oftener in\nthe shape of wondering conjectures whether he would dare to make love to\nher, than in any pretended knowledge of their relations to each other,\nthat the public tongue exercised its village-prerogative of tattle.\n\nThe more common version of the trouble at the mansion-house was this:\nElsie was not exactly in her right mind. Her temper was singular, her\ntastes were anomalous, her habits were lawless, her antipathies were\nmany and intense, and she was liable to explosions of ungovernable\nanger. Some said that was not the worst of it. At nearly fifteen years\nold, when she was growing fast, and in an irritable state of mind and\nbody, she had had a governess placed over her for whom she had conceived\nan aversion. It was whispered among a few who knew more of the family\nsecrets than others, that, worried and exasperated by the presence and\njealous oversight of this person, Elsie had attempted to get finally rid\nof her by unlawful means, such as young girls have been known to\nemploy in their straits, and to which the sex at all ages has a certain\ninstinctive tendency, in preference to more palpable instruments for\nthe righting of its wrongs. At any rate, this governess had been taken\nsuddenly ill, and the Doctor had been sent for at midnight. Old Sophy\nhad taken her master into a room apart, and said a few words to him\nwhich turned him as white as a sheet. As soon as he recovered himself,\nhe sent Sophy out, called in the old Doctor, and gave him some few\nhints, on which he acted at once, and had the satisfaction of seeing\nhis patient out of danger before he left in the morning. It is proper to\nsay, that, during the following days, the most thorough search was made\nin every nook and cranny of those parts of the house which Elsie chiefly\nhaunted, but nothing was found which might be accused of having been\nthe intentional cause of the probably accidental sudden illness of the\ngoverness. From this time forward her father was never easy. Should he\nkeep her apart, or shut her up, for fear of risk to others, and so\nlose every chance of restoring her mind to its healthy tone by kindly\ninfluences and intercourse with wholesome natures? There was no proof,\nonly presumption, as to the agency of Elsie in the matter referred to.\nBut the doubt was worse, perhaps, than certainty would have been,--for\nthen he would have known what to do.\n\nHe took the old Doctor as his adviser. The shrewd old man listened to\nthe father's story, his explanations of possibilities, of probabilities,\nof dangers, of hopes. When he had got through, the Doctor looked him in\nthe face steadily, as if he were saying, Is that all?\n\nThe father's eyes fell. This was not all. There was something at the\nbottom of his soul which he could not bear to speak of,--nay, which,\nas often as it reared itself through the dark waves of unworded\nconsciousness into the breathing air of thought, he trod down as the\nruined angels tread down a lost soul, trying to come up out of the\nseething sea of torture. Only this one daughter! No! God never would\nhave ordained such a thing. There was nothing ever heard of like it; it\ncould not be; she was ill,--she would outgrow all these singularities;\nhe had had an aunt who was peculiar; he had heard that hysteric girls\nshowed the strangest forms of moral obliquity for a time, but came right\nat last. She would change all at once, when her health got more firmly\nsettled in the course of her growth. Are there not rough buds that open\ninto sweet flowers? Are there not fruits, which, while unripe, are\nnot to be tasted or endured, which mature into the richest taste and\nfragrance? In God's good time she would come to her true nature; her\neyes would lose that frightful, cold glitter; her lips would not feel so\ncold when she pressed them against his cheek; and that faint birth-mark,\nher mother swooned when she first saw, would fade wholly out,--it was\nless marked, surely, now than it used to be!\n\nSo Dudley Venner felt, and would have thought, if he had let his\nthoughts breathe the air of his soul. But the Doctor read through words\nand thoughts and all into the father's consciousness. There are states\nof mind which may be shared by two persons in presence of each other,\nwhich remain not only unworded, but unthoughted, if such a word may\nbe coined for our special need. Such a mutually interpenetrative\nconsciousness there was between the father and the old physician. By a\ncommon impulse, both of them rose in a mechanical way and went to the\nwestern window, where each started, as he saw the other's look directed\ntowards the white stone which stood in the midst of the small plot of\ngreen turf.\n\nThe Doctor had, for a moment, forgotten himself but he looked up at the\nclouds, which were angry, and said, as if speaking of the weather, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\nis dark now, but we hope it will clear up by and by. There are a great\nmany more clouds than rains, and more rains than strokes of lightning,\nand more strokes of lightning than there are people killed. We must let\nthis girl of ours have her way, as far as it is safe. Send away this\nwoman she hates, quietly. Get her a foreigner for a governess, if you\ncan,--one that can dance and sing and will teach her. In the house\nold Sophy will watch her best. Out of it you must trust her, I am\nafraid,--for she will not be followed round, and she is in less danger\nthan you think. If she wanders at night, find her, if you can; the woods\nare not absolutely safe. If she will be friendly with any young people,\nhave them to see her,--young men especially. She will not love any one\neasily, perhaps not at all; yet love would be more like to bring her\nright than anything else. If any young person seems in danger of falling\nin love with her, send him to me for counsel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDry, hard advice, but given from a kind hewn, with a moist eye, and in\ntones which tried to be cheerful and were full of sympathy. This advice\nwas the key to the more than indulgent treatment which, as we have seen,\nthe girl had received from her father and all about her. The old Doctor\noften came in, in the kindest, most natural sort of way, got into\npleasant relations with Elsie by always treating her in the same easy\nmanner as at the great party, encouraging all her harmless fancies, and\nrarely reminding her that he was a professional adviser, except when\nshe came out of her own accord, as in the talk they had at the party,\ntelling him of some wild trick she had been playing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet her go to the girls' school, by all means,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, when\nshe had begun to talk about it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPossibly she may take to some of the\ngirls or of the teachers. Anything to interest her. Friendship, love,\nreligion, whatever will set her nature at work. We must have headway on,\nor there will be no piloting her. Action first of all, and then we will\nsee what to do with it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo, when Cousin Richard came along, the Doctor, though he did not like\nhis looks any too well, told her father to encourage his staying for a\ntime. If she liked him, it was good; if she only tolerated him, it was\nbetter than nothing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know something about that nephew of yours, during these last years,\nI suppose?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLooks as if he had seen life. Has a scar\nthat was made by a sword-cut, and a white spot on the side of his neck\nthat looks like a bullet-mark. I think he has been what folks call a\n'hard customer.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDudley Venner owned that he had heard little or nothing of him of late\nyears. He had invited himself, and of course it would not be decent not\nto receive him as a relative. He thought Elsie rather liked having him\nabout the house for a while. She was very capricious,--acted as if she\nfancied him one day and disliked him the next. He did not know,--but\nsometimes thought that this nephew of his might take a serious liking to\nElsie. What should he do about it, if it turned out so?\n\nThe Doctor lifted his eyebrows a little. He thought there was no fear.\nElsie was naturally what they call a man-hater, and there was very\nlittle danger of any sudden passion springing up between two such young\npersons. Let him stay awhile; it gives her something to think about. So\nhe stayed awhile, as we have seen.\n\nThe more Mr. Richard became acquainted with the family,--that is, with\nthe two persons of whom it consisted,--the more favorably the idea of\na permanent residence in the mansion-house seemed to impress him. The\nestate was large,--hundreds of acres, with woodlands and meadows of\ngreat value. The father and daughter had been living quietly, and there\ncould not be a doubt that the property which came through the Dudleys\nmust have largely increased of late years. It was evident enough that\nthey had an abundant income, from the way in which Elsie's caprices were\nindulged. She had horses and carriages to suit herself; she sent to\nthe great city for everything she wanted in the way of dress. Even her\ndiamonds--and the young man knew something about these gems--must be of\nconsiderable value; and yet she wore them carelessly, as it pleased her\nfancy. She had precious old laces, too, almost worth their weight in\ndiamonds; laces which had been snatched from altars in ancient Spanish\ncathedrals during the wars, and which it would not be safe to leave\na duchess alone with for ten minutes. The old house was fat with the\ndeposits of rich generations which had gone before. The famous \u00e2\u0080\u009cgolden\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n fire-set was a purchase of one of the family who had been in France\nduring the Revolution, and must have come from a princely palace, if not\nfrom one of the royal residences. As for silver, the iron closet\nwhich had been made in the dining-room wall was running over with\nit: tea-kettles, coffee-pots, heavy-lidded tankards, chafing-dishes,\npunch-bowls, all that all the Dudleys had ever used, from the caudle-cup\nwhich used to be handed round the young mother's chamber, and the\nporringer from which children scooped their bread-and-milk with spoons\nas solid as ingots, to that ominous vessel, on the upper shelf, far back\nin the dark, with a spout like a slender italic S, out of which the sick\nand dying, all along the last century, and since, had taken the last\ndrops that passed their lips. Without being much of a scholar, Dick\ncould see well enough, too, that the books in the library had been\nordered from the great London houses, whose imprint they bore, by\npersons who knew what was best and meant to have it. A man does not\nrequire much learning to feel pretty sure, when he takes one of those\nsolid, smooth, velvet-leaved quartos, say a Baskerville Addison, for\ninstance, bound in red morocco, with a margin of gold as rich as the\nembroidery of a prince's collar, as Vandyck drew it,--he need not know\nmuch to feel pretty sure that a score or two of shelves full of such\nbooks mean that it took a long purse, as well as a literary taste, to\nbring them together.\n\nTo all these attractions the mind of this thoughtful young gentleman\nmay be said to have been fully open. He did not disguise from himself,\nhowever, that there were a number of drawbacks in the way of his\nbecoming established as the heir of the Dudley mansion-house and\nfortune. In the first place, Cousin Elsie was, unquestionably, very\npiquant, very handsome, game as a hawk, and hard to please, which\nmade her worth trying for. But then there was something about Cousin\nElsie,--(the small, white scars began stinging, as he said this to\nhimself, and he pushed his sleeve up to look at them)--there was\nsomething about Cousin Elsie he couldn't make out. What was the matter\nwith her eyes, that they sucked your life out of you in that strange\nway? What did she always wear a necklace for? Had she some such\nlove-token on her neck as the old Don's revolver had left on his? How\nsafe would anybody feel to live with her? Besides, her father would last\nforever, if he was left to himself. And he may take it into his head to\nmarry again. That would be pleasant!\n\nSo talked Cousin Richard to himself, in the calm of the night and in the\ntranquillity of his own soul. There was much to be said on both sides.\nIt was a balance to be struck after the two columns were added up. He\nstruck the balance, and came to the conclusion that he would fall in\nlove with Elsie Venner.\n\nThe intelligent reader will not confound this matured and serious\nintention of falling in love with the young lady with that mere impulse\nof the moment before mentioned as an instance of making love. On the\ncontrary, the moment Mr. Richard had made up his mind that he should\nfall in love with Elsie, he began to be more reserved with her, and to\ntry to make friends in other quarters. Sensible men, you know, care very\nlittle what a girl's present fancy is. The question is: Who manages her,\nand how can you get at that person or those persons? Her foolish little\nsentiments are all very well in their way; but business is business, and\nwe can't stop for such trifles. The old political wire-pullers never go\nnear the man they want to gain, if they can help it; they find out who\nhis intimates and managers are, and work through them. Always handle any\npositively electrical body, whether it is charged with passion or power,\nwith some non-conductor between you and it, not with your naked hands.\n--The above were some of the young gentleman's working axioms; and he\nproceeded to act in accordance with them.\n\nHe began by paying his court more assiduously to his uncle. It was not\nvery hard to ingratiate himself in that quarter; for his manners\nwere insinuating, and his precocious experience of life made him\nentertaining. The old neglected billiard--room was soon put in order,\nand Dick, who was a magnificent player, had a series of games with his\nuncle, in which, singularly enough, he was beaten, though his antagonist\nhad been out of play for years. He evinced a profound interest in the\nfamily history, insisted on having the details of its early alliances,\nand professed a great pride in it, which he had inherited from his\nfather, who, though he had allied himself with the daughter of an alien\nrace, had yet chosen one with the real azure blood in her veins, as\nproud as if she had Castile and Aragon for her dower and the Cid for her\ngrand-papa. He also asked a great deal of advice, such as inexperienced\nyoung persons are in need of, and listened to it with due reverence.\n\nIt is not very strange that uncle Dudley took a kinder view of his\nnephew than the Judge, who thought he could read a questionable history\nin his face,--or the old Doctor, who knew men's temperaments and\norganizations pretty well, and had his prejudices about races, and could\ntell an old sword-cut and a ballet-mark in two seconds from a scar got\nby falling against the fender, or a mark left by king's evil. He could\nnot be expected to share our own prejudices; for he had heard nothing\nof the wild youth's adventures, or his scamper over the Pampas at short\nnotice. So, then, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRichard Venner, Esquire, guest of Dudley Venner,\nEsquire, at his elegant mansion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d prolonged his visit until his presence\nbecame something like a matter of habit, and the neighbors began to\nthink that the fine old house would be illuminated before long for a\ngrand marriage.\n\nHe had done pretty well with the father: the next thing was to gain over\nthe nurse. Old Sophy was as cunning as a red fox or a gray woodchuck.\nShe had nothing in the world to do but to watch Elsie; she had nothing\nto care for but this girl and her father. She had never liked Dick too\nwell; for he used to make faces at her and tease her when he was a boy,\nand now he was a man there was something about him--she could not tell\nwhat--that made her suspicious of him. It was no small matter to get her\nover to his side.\n\nThe jet-black Africans know that gold never looks so well as on the foil\nof their dark skins. Dick found in his trunk a string of gold beads,\nsuch as are manufactured in some of our cities, which he had brought\nfrom the gold region of Chili,--so he said,--for the express purpose of\ngiving them to old Sophy. These Africans, too, have a perfect passion\nfor gay-colored clothing; being condemned by Nature, as it were, to\na perpetual mourning-suit, they love to enliven it with all sorts of\nvariegated stuffs of sprightly patterns, aflame with red and yellow.\nThe considerate young man had remembered this, too, and brought home\nfor Sophy some handkerchiefs of rainbow hues, which had been strangely\noverlooked till now, at the bottom of one of his trunks. Old Sophy took\nhis gifts, but kept her black eyes open and watched every movement\nof the young people all the more closely. It was through her that\nthe father had always known most of the actions and tendencies of his\ndaughter.\n\nIn the mean time the strange adventure on The Mountain had brought the\nyoung master into new relations with Elsie. She had led him out of,\ndanger; perhaps saved him from death by the strange power she exerted.\nHe was grateful, and yet shuddered at the recollection of the whole\nscene. In his dreams he was pursued by the glare of cold glittering\neyes, whether they were in the head of a woman or of a reptile he could\nnot always tell, the images had so run together. But he could not help\nseeing that the eyes of the young girl had been often, very often,\nturned upon him when he had been looking away, and fell as his own\nglance met them. Helen Darley told him very plainly that this girl was\nthinking about him more than about her book. Dick Venner found she\nwas getting more constant in her attendance at school. He learned, on\ninquiry, that there was a new master, a handsome young man. The handsome\nyoung man would not have liked the look that, came over Dick's face when\nhe heard this fact mentioned.\n\nIn short, everything was getting tangled up together, and there would be\nno chance of disentangling the threads in this chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. PHYSIOLOGICAL.\n\nIf Master Bernard felt a natural gratitude to his young pupil for saving\nhim from an imminent peril, he was in a state of infinite perplexity\nto know why he should have needed such aid. He, an active, muscular,\ncourageous, adventurous young fellow, with--a stick in his hand, ready\nto hold down the Old Serpent himself, if he had come in his way, to\nstand still, staring into those two eyes, until they came up close to\nhim, and the strange, terrible sound seemed to freeze him stiff where he\nstood,--what was the meaning of it? Again, what was the influence\nthis girl had seemingly exerted, under which the venomous creature had\ncollapsed in such a sudden way? Whether he had been awake or dreaming\nhe did not feel quite sure. He knew he had gone up The Mountain, at any\nrate; he knew he had come down The Mountain with the girl walking just\nbefore him;--there was no forgetting her figure, as she walked on\nin silence, her braided locks falling a little, for want of the lost\nhairpin, perhaps, and looking like a wreathing coil of--Shame on such\nfancies!--to wrong that supreme crowning gift of abounding Nature, a\nrush of shining black hair, which, shaken loose, would cloud her all\nround, like Godiva, from brow to instep! He was sure he had sat down\nbefore the fissure or cave. He was sure that he was led softly away from\nthe place, and that it was Elsie who had led him. There was the hair-pin\nto show that so far it was not a dream. But between these recollections\ncame a strange confusion; and the more the master thought, the more he\nwas perplexed to know whether she had waked him, sleeping, as he sat on\nthe stone, from some frightful dream, such as may come in a very brief\nslumber, or whether she had bewitched him into a trance with those\nstrange eyes of hers, or whether it was all true, and he must solve its\nproblem as he best might.\n\nThere was another recollection connected with this mountain adventure.\nAs they approached the mansion-house, they met a young man, whom Mr.\nBernard remembered having seen once at least before, and whom he had\nheard of as a cousin of the young girl. As Cousin Richard Venner, the\nperson in question, passed them, he took the measure, so to speak, of\nMr. Bernard, with a look so piercing, so exhausting, so practised, so\nprofoundly suspicious, that the young master felt in an instant that he\nhad an enemy in this handsome youth,--an enemy, too, who was like to be\nsubtle and dangerous.\n\nMr. Bernard had made up his mind, that, come what might, enemy or no\nenemy, live or die, he would solve the mystery of Elsie Venner, sooner\nor later. He was not a man to be frightened out of his resolution by a\nscowl, or a stiletto, or any unknown means of mischief, of which a whole\narmory was hinted at in that passing look Dick Venner had given him.\nIndeed, like most adventurous young persons, he found a kind of charm\nin feeling that there might be some dangers in the way of his\ninvestigations. Some rumors which had reached him about the supposed\nsuitor of Elsie Venner, who was thought to be a desperate kind of\nfellow, and whom some believed to be an unscrupulous adventurer, added\na curious, romantic kind of interest to the course of physiological and\npsychological inquiries he was about instituting.\n\nThe afternoon on The Mountain was still upper-most in his mind. Of\ncourse he knew the common stories--about fascination. He had once been\nhimself an eyewitness of the charming of a small bird by one of our\ncommon harmless serpents. Whether a human being could be reached by this\nsubtile agency, he had been skeptical, notwithstanding the mysterious\nrelation generally felt to exist between man and this creature, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccursed\nabove all cattle and above every beast of the field,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--a relation which\nsome interpret as the fruit of the curse, and others hold to be so\ninstinctive that this animal has been for that reason adopted as the\nnatural symbol of evil. There was another solution, however, supplied\nhim by his professional reading. The curious work of Mr. Braid of\nManchester had made him familiar with the phenomena of a state allied to\nthat produced by animal magnetism, and called by that writer by the name\nof hypnotism. He found, by referring to his note-book, the statement\nwas, that, by fixing the eyes on a bright object so placed as to produce\na strain upon the eyes and eyelids, and to maintain a steady fixed\nstare, there comes on in a few seconds a very singular condition,\ncharacterized by muscular rigidity and inability to move, with a\nstrange exaltation of most of the senses, and generally a closure of the\neyelids,--this condition being followed by torpor.\n\nNow this statement of Mr. Braid's, well known to the scientific world,\nand the truth of which had been confirmed by Mr. Bernard in\ncertain experiments he had instituted, as it has been by many other\nexperimenters, went far to explain the strange impressions, of which,\nwaking or dreaming, he had certainly been the subject. His nervous\nsystem had been in a high state of exaltation at the time. He remembered\nhow the little noises that made rings of sound in the silence of the\nwoods, like pebbles dropped in still waters, had reached his inner\nconsciousness. He remembered that singular sensation in the roots of the\nhair, when he came on the traces of the girl's presence, reminding him\nof a line in a certain poem which he had read lately with a new and\npeculiar interest. He even recalled a curious evidence of exalted\nsensibility and irritability, in the twitching of the minute muscles of\nthe internal ear at every unexpected sound, producing an odd little snap\nin the middle of the head, which proved to him that he was getting very\nnervous.\n\nThe next thing was to find out whether it were possible that the\nvenomous creature's eyes should have served the purpose of Mr. Braid's\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbright object\u00e2\u0080\u009d held very close to the person experimented on, or\nwhether they had any special power which could be made the subject of\nexact observation.\n\nFor this purpose Mr. Bernard considered it necessary to get a live\ncrotalus or two into his possession, if this were possible. On inquiry,\nhe found that there was a certain family living far up the mountainside,\nnot a mile from the ledge, the members of which were said to have taken\nthese creatures occasionally, and not to be in any danger, or at least\nin any fear, of being injured by them. He applied to these people, and\noffered a reward sufficient to set them at work to capture some of these\nanimals, if such a thing were possible.\n\nA few days after this, a dark, gypsy-looking woman presented herself at\nhis door. She held up her apron as if it contained something precious in\nthe bag she made with it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cY' wanted some rattlers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the woman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere they be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe opened her apron and showed a coil of rattlesnakes lying very\npeaceably in its fold. They lifted their heads up, as if they wanted to\nsee what was going on, but showed no sign of anger.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you crazy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Bernard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou're dead in an hour, if one of\nthose creatures strikes you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe drew back a little, as he spoke; it might be simple disgust; it might\nbe fear; it might be what we call antipathy, which is different from\neither, and which will sometimes show itself in paleness, and even\nfaintness, produced by objects perfectly harmless and not in themselves\noffensive to any sense.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord bless you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the woman, \u00e2\u0080\u009crattlers never touches our folks. I'd\njest 'z lieves handle them creaturs as so many striped snakes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, she put their heads down with her hand, and packed them\ntogether in her apron as if they had been bits of cart-rope.\n\nMr. Bernard had never heard of the power, or, at least, the belief in\nthe possession of a power by certain persons, which enables them\nto handle these frightful reptiles with perfect impunity. The fact,\nhowever, is well known to others, and more especially to a very\ndistinguished Professor in one of the leading institutions of the great\ncity of the land, whose experiences in the neighborhood of Graylock, as\nhe will doubtless inform the curious, were very much like those of the\nyoung master.\n\nMr. Bernard had a wired cage ready for his formidable captives, and\nstudied their habits and expression with a strange sort of interest.\nWhat did the Creator mean to signify, when he made such shapes of\nhorror, and, as if he had doubly cursed this envenomed wretch, had set\na mark upon him and sent him forth the Cain of the brotherhood of\nserpents? It was a very curious fact that the first train of thoughts\nMr. Bernard's small menagerie suggested to him was the grave, though\nsomewhat worn, subject of the origin of evil. There is now to be seen in\na tall glass jar, in the Museum of Comparative Anatomy at Cantabridge in\nthe territory of the Massachusetts, a huge crotalus, of a species which\ngrows to more frightful dimensions than our own, under the hotter skies\nof South America. Look at it, ye who would know what is the tolerance,\nthe freedom from prejudice, which can suffer such an incarnation of all\nthat is devilish to lie unharmed in the cradle of Nature! Learn, too,\nthat there are many things in this world which we are warned to shun,\nand are even suffered to slay, if need be, but which we must not hate,\nunless we would hate what God loves and cares for.\n\nWhatever fascination the creature might exercise in his native haunts,\nMr. Bernard found himself not in the least nervous or affected in any\nway while looking at his caged reptiles. When their cage was shaken,\nthey would lift their heads and spring their rattles; but the sound was\nby no means so formidable to listen to as when it reverberated among\nthe chasms of the echoing rocks. The expression of the creatures was\nwatchful, still, grave, passionless, fate-like, suggesting a cold\nmalignity which seemed to be waiting for its opportunity. Their awful,\ndeep-cut mouths were sternly closed over the long hollow fangs which\nrested their roots against the swollen poison-gland, where the venom had\nbeen hoarding up ever since the last stroke had emptied it. They never\nwinked, for ophidians have no movable eyelids, but kept up that awful\nfixed stare which made the two unwinking gladiators the survivors of\ntwenty pairs matched by one of the Roman Emperors, as Pliny tells us, in\nhis \u00e2\u0080\u009cNatural History.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Their eyes did not flash, but shone with a cold\nstill light. They were of a pale-golden or straw color, horrible to look\ninto, with their stony calmness, their pitiless indifference, hardly\nenlivened by the almost imperceptible vertical slit of the pupil,\nthrough which Death seemed to be looking out like the archer behind the\nlong narrow loop-hole in a blank turret-wall. On the whole, the caged\nreptiles, horrid as they were, hardly matched his recollections of what\nhe had seen or dreamed he save at the cavern. These looked dangerous\nenough, but yet quiet. A treacherous stillness, however,--as the\nunfortunate New York physician found, when he put his foot out to wake\nup the torpid creature, and instantly the fang flashed through his boot,\ncarrying the poison into his blood, and death with it.\n\nMr. Bernard kept these strange creatures, and watched all their habits\nwith a natural curiosity. In any collection of animals the venomous\nbeasts are looked at with the greatest interest, just as the greatest\nvillains are most run after by the unknown public. Nobody troubles\nhimself for a common striped snake or a petty thief, but a cobra or a\nwife-killer is a centre of attraction to all eyes. These captives did\nvery little to earn their living, but, on the other hand, their living\nwas not expensive, their diet being nothing but air, au naturel. Months\nand months these creatures will live and seem to thrive well enough,\nas any showman who has then in his menagerie will testify, though they\nnever touch anything to eat or drink.\n\nIn the mean time Mr. Bernard had become very curious about a class of\nsubjects not treated of in any detail in those text-books accessible in\nmost country-towns, to the exclusion of the more special treatises, and\nespecially of the rare and ancient works found on the shelves of the\nlarger city-libraries. He was on a visit to old Dr. Kittredge one\nday, having been asked by him to call in for a few moments as soon as\nconvenient. The Doctor smiled good-humoredly when he asked him if he had\nan extensive collection of medical works.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI haven't got a great many printed\nbooks; and what I have I don't read quite as often as I might, I'm\nafraid. I read and studied in the time of it, when I was in the midst of\nthe young men who were all at work with their books; but it's a mighty\nhard matter, when you go off alone into the country, to keep up with\nall that's going on in the Societies and the Colleges. I'll tell you,\nthough, Mr. Langdon, when a man that's once started right lives among\nsick folks for five-and-thirty years, as I've done, if he has n't got\na library of five-and-thirty volumes bound up in his head at the end of\nthat time, he'd better stop driving round and sell his horse and sulky.\nI know the bigger part of the families within a dozen miles' ride. I\nknow the families that have a way of living through everything, and\nI know the other set that have the trick of dying without any kind of\nreason for it. I know the years when the fevers and dysenteries are in\nearnest, and when they're only making believe. I know the folks that\nthink they're dying as soon as they're sick, and the folks that never\nfind out they 're sick till they're dead. I don't want to undervalue\nyour science, Mr. Langdon. There are things I never learned, because\nthey came in after my day, and I am very glad to send my patients to\nthose that do know them, when I am at fault; but I know these people\nabout here, fathers and mothers, and children and grandchildren, so\nas all the science in the world can't know them, without it takes time\nabout it, and sees them grow up and grow old, and how the wear and tear\nof life comes to them. You can't tell a horse by driving him once, Mr.\nLangdon, nor a patient by talking half an hour with him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know much about the Veneer family?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Bernard, in a\nnatural way enough, the Doctor's talk having suggested the question.\n\nThe Doctor lifted his head with his accustomed movement, so as to\ncommand the young man through his spectacles.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know all the families of this place and its neighborhood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nanswered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have the young lady studying with us at the Institute,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr.\nBernard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs she a good scholar?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAll this time the Doctor's eyes were fixed steadily on Mr. Bernard,\nlooking through the glasses.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is a good scholar enough, but I don't know what to make of her.\nSometimes I think she is a little out of her head. Her father, I\nbelieve, is sensible enough;--what sort of a woman was her mother,\nDoctor?--I suppose, of course, you remember all about her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I knew her mother. She was a very lovely young woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--The Doctor\nput his hand to his forehead and drew a long breath.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is there you\nnotice out of the way about Elsie Venner?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA good many things,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the master answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe shuns all the other\ngirls. She is getting a strange influence over my fellow-teacher, a\nyoung lady,--you know Miss Helen Darley, perhaps? I am afraid this girl\nwill kill her. I never saw or heard of anything like it, in prose at\nleast;--do you remember much of Coleridge's Poems, Doctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe good old Doctor had to plead a negative.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, no matter. Elsie would have been burned for a witch in old times.\nI have seen the girl look at Miss Darley when she had not the least idea\nof it, and all at once I would see her grow pale and moist, and sigh,\nand move round uneasily, and turn towards Elsie, and perhaps get up\nand go to her, or else have slight spasmodic movements that looked like\nhysterics;--do you believe in the evil eye, Doctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Langdon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor said, solemnly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere are strange things\nabout Elsie Veneer,--very strange things. This was what I wanted to\nspeak to you about. Let me advise you all to be very patient with the\ngirl, but also very careful. Her love is not to be desired, and \u00e2\u0080\u009c--he\nspoke in a lower tone--\u00e2\u0080\u009cher hate is to be dreaded. Do you think she has\nany special fancy for anybody else in the school besides Miss Darley?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Bernard could not stand the old Doctor's spectacled eyes without\nbetraying a little of the feeling natural to a young man to whom a home\nquestion involving a possible sentiment is put suddenly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have suspected,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have had a kind of feeling--that\nshe--Well, come, Doctor,--I don't know that there 's any use in\ndisguising the matter,--I have thought Elsie Veneer had rather a fancy\nfor somebody else,--I mean myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was something so becoming in the blush with which the young man\nmade this confession, and so manly, too, in the tone with which he\nspoke, so remote from any shallow vanity, such as young men who are\nincapable of love are apt to feel, when some loose tendril of a woman's\nfancy which a chance wind has blown against them twines about them\nfor the want of anything better, that the old Doctor looked at him\nadmiringly, and could not help thinking that it was no wonder any young\ngirl should be pleased with him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a man of nerve, Mr. Langdon?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought so till very lately,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not easily\nfrightened, but I don't know but I might be bewitched or magnetized, or\nwhatever it is when one is tied up and cannot move. I think I can find\nnerve enough, however, if there is any special use you want to put it\nto.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me ask you one more question, Mr. Langdon. Do you find yourself\ndisposed to take a special interest in Elsie,--to fall in love with her,\nin a word? Pardon me, for I do not ask from curiosity, but a much more\nserious motive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cElsie interests me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young man, \u00e2\u0080\u009cinterests me strangely. She\nhas a wild flavor in her character which is wholly different from that\nof any human creature I ever saw. She has marks of genius, poetic or\ndramatic,--I hardly know which. She read a passage from Keats's 'Lamia'\nthe other day, in the schoolroom, in such a way that I declare to you I\nthought some of the girls would faint or go into fits. Miss Darley got\nup and left the room, trembling all over. Then, I pity her, she is so\nlonely. The girls are afraid of her, and she seems to have either a\ndislike or a fear of them. They have all sorts of painful stories about\nher. They give her a name which no human creature ought to bear. They\nsay she hides a mark on her neck by always wearing a necklace. She\nis very graceful, you know, and they will have it that she can twist\nherself into all sorts of shapes, or tie herself in a knot, if she wants\nto. There is not one of them that will look her in the eyes. I pity the\npoor girl; but, Doctor, I do not love her. I would risk my life for her,\nif it would do her any good, but it would be in cold blood. If her hand\ntouches mine, it is not a thrill of passion I feel running through me,\nbut a very different emotion. Oh, Doctor! there must be something in\nthat creature's blood which has killed the humanity in her. God only\nknows the cause that has blighted such a soul in so beautiful a body!\nNo, Doctor, I do not love the girl.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Langdon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are young, and I am old. Let me\ntalk to you with an old man's privilege, as an adviser. You have come to\nthis country-town without suspicion, and you are moving in the midst of\nperils. There are things which I must not tell you now; but I may warn\nyou. Keep your eyes open and your heart shut. If, through pitying that\ngirl, you ever come to love her, you are lost. If you deal carelessly\nwith her, beware! This is not all. There are other eyes on you beside\nElsie Venner's. Do you go armed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Bernard,--and he \u00e2\u0080\u009cput his hands up\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the shape\nof fists, in such a way as to show that he was master of the natural\nweapons at any rate.\n\nThe Doctor could not help smiling. But his face fell in an instant.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may want something more than those tools to work with. Come with me\ninto my sanctum.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor led Mr. Bernard into a small room opening out of the study.\nIt was a place such as anybody but a medical man would shiver to enter.\nThere was the usual tall box with its bleached, rattling tenant; there\nwere jars in rows where \u00e2\u0080\u009cinteresting cases\u00e2\u0080\u009d outlived the grief of widows\nand heirs in alcoholic immortality,--for your \u00e2\u0080\u009cpreparation-jar\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the\ntrue \u00e2\u0080\u009cmonumentum aere perennius;\u00e2\u0080\u009d there were various semi-possibilities\nof minute dimensions and unpromising developments; there were shining\ninstruments of evil aspect, and grim plates on the walls, and on one\nshelf by itself, accursed and apart, coiled in a long cylinder of\nspirit, a huge crotalus, rough-scaled, flatheaded, variegated with dull\nbands, one of which partially encircled the neck like a collar,--an\nawful wretch to look upon, with murder written all over him in horrid\nhieroglyphics. Mr. Bernard's look was riveted on this creature,--not\nfascinated certainly, for its eyes looked like white beads, being\nclouded by the action of the spirits in which it had been long\nkept,--but fixed by some indefinite sense of the renewal of a previous\nimpression;--everybody knows the feeling, with its suggestion of some\npast state of existence. There was a scrap of paper on the jar, with\nsomething written on it. He was reaching up to read it when the Doctor\ntouched him lightly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook here, Mr. Langdon!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, with a certain vivacity of manner, as\nif wishing to call away his attention,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is my armory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor threw open the door of a small cabinet, where were disposed\nin artistic patterns various weapons of offence and defence,--for he was\na virtuoso in his way, and by the side of the implements of the art of\nhealing had pleased himself with displaying a collection of those other\ninstruments, the use of which renders the first necessary.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSee which of these weapons you would like best to carry about you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said the Doctor.\n\nMr. Bernard laughed, and looked at the Doctor as if he half doubted\nwhether he was in earnest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis looks dangerous enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cfor the man who carries it, at\nleast.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe took down one of the prohibited Spanish daggers or knives which a\ntraveller may, occasionally get hold of and smuggle out of the country.\nThe blade was broad, trowel-like, but the point drawn out several\ninches, so as to look like a skewer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis must be a jealous bull-fighter's weapon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, and put it back\nin its place.\n\nThen he took down an ancient-looking broad-bladed dagger, with a complex\naspect about it, as if it had some kind of mechanism connected with it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake care!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is a trick to that dagger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe took it and touched a spring. The dagger split suddenly into three\nblades, as when one separates the forefinger and the ring-finger from\nthe middle one. The outside blades were sharp on their outer edge. The\nstab was to be made with the dagger shut, then the spring touched and\nthe split blades withdrawn.\n\nMr. Bernard replaced it, saying, that it would have served for sidearm\nto old Suwarrow, who told his men to work their bayonets back and\nforward when they pinned a Turk, but to wriggle them about in the wound\nwhen they stabbed a Frenchman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is the thing you want.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe took down a much more modern and familiar implement,--a small,\nbeautifully finished revolver.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI want you to carry this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand more than that, I want you to\npractise with it often, as for amusement, but so that it maybe seen and\nunderstood that you are apt to have a pistol about you. Pistol-shooting\nis pleasant sport enough, and there is no reason why you should not\npractise it like other young fellows. And now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have\none other, weapon to give you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe took a small piece of parchment and shook a white powder into it from\none of his medicine-jars. The jar was marked with the name of a mineral\nsalt, of a nature to have been serviceable in case of sudden illness in\nthe time of the Borgias. The Doctor folded the parchment carefully, and\nmarked the Latin name of the powder upon it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, handing it to Mr. Bernard, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou see what it is, and you\nknow what service it can render. Keep these two protectors about your\nperson day and night; they will not harm you, and you may want one or\nthe other or both before you think of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Bernard thought it was very odd, and not very old-gentlemanlike,\nto be fitting him out for treason, stratagem, and spoils, in this way.\nThere was no harm, however, in carrying a doctor's powder in his pocket,\nor in amusing himself with shooting at a mark, as he had often done\nbefore. If the old gentleman had these fancies, it was as well to humor\nhim.\n\nSo he thanked old Doctor Kittredge, and shook his hand warmly as he left\nhim.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fellow's hand did not tremble, nor his color change,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor\nsaid, as he watched him walking away. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is one of the right sort.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. EPISTOLARY.\n\nMr. Langdon to the Professor.\n\nMY DEAR PROFESSOR, You were kind enough to promise me that you would\nassist me in any professional or scientific investigations in which I\nmight become engaged. I have of late become deeply interested in a class\nof subjects which present peculiar difficulty, and I must exercise\nthe privilege of questioning you on some points upon which I desire\ninformation I cannot otherwise obtain. I would not trouble you, if I\ncould find any person or books competent to enlighten me on some of\nthese singular matters which have so excited me. The leading doctor here\nis a shrewd, sensible man, but not versed in the curiosities of medical\nliterature.\n\nI proceed, with your leave, to ask a considerable number of\nquestions,--hoping to get answers to some of them, at least.\n\nIs there any evidence that human beings can be infected or wrought\nupon by poisons, or otherwise, so that they shall manifest any of\nthe peculiarities belonging to beings of a lower nature? Can such\npeculiarities--be transmitted by inheritance? Is there anything to\ncountenance the stories, long and widely current, about the \u00e2\u0080\u009cevil eye\u00e2\u0080\u009d?\nor is it a mere fancy that such a power belongs to any human being? Have\nyou any personal experience as to the power of fascination said to be\nexercised by certain animals? What can you make of those circumstantial\nstatements we have seen in the papers, of children forming mysterious\nfriendships with ophidians of different species, sharing their food with\nthem, and seeming to be under some subtile influence exercised by those\ncreatures? Have you read, critically, Coleridge's poem of \u00e2\u0080\u009cChristabel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n and Keats's \u00e2\u0080\u009cLamia\u00e2\u0080\u009d?--If so, can you understand them, or find any\nphysiological foundation for the story of either?\n\nThere is another set of questions of a different nature I should like\nto ask, but it is hardly fair to put so many on a single sheet. There\nis one, however, you must answer. Do you think there may be\npredispositions, inherited or ingrafted, but at any rate constitutional,\nwhich shall take out certain apparently voluntary determinations\nfrom the control of the will, and leave them as free from moral\nresponsibility as the instincts of the lower animals? Do you not think\nthere may be a crime which is not a sin?\n\nPardon me, my dear Sir, for troubling you with such a list of notes of\ninterrogation. There are some very strange things going on here in this\nplace, country-town as it is. Country-life is apt to be dull; but when\nit once gets going, it beats the city hollow, because it gives its whole\nmind to what it is about. These rural sinners make terrible work with\nthe middle of the Decalogue, when they get started. However, I hope I\nshall live through my year's school-keeping without catastrophes, though\nthere are queer doings about me which puzzle me and might scare some\npeople. If anything should happen, you will be one of the first to\nhear of it, no doubt. But I trust not to help out the editors of the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRockland Weekly Universe\u00e2\u0080\u009d with an obituary of the late lamented, who\nsigned himself in life--\n\nYour friend and pupil, BERNARD C. LANGDON.\n\n\nThe Professor to Mr. Langdon.\n\nMY DEAR MR. LANGDON, I do not wonder that you find no answer from your\ncountry friends to the curious questions you put. They belong to that\nmiddle region between science and poetry which sensible men, as they are\ncalled, are very shy of meddling with. Some people think that truth and\ngold are always to be washed for; but the wiser sort are of opinion,\nthat, unless there are so many grains to the peck of sand or nonsense\nrespectively, it does not pay to wash for either, so long as one can\nfind anything else to do. I don't doubt there is some truth in the\nphenomena of animal magnetism, for instance; but when you ask me to\ncradle for it, I tell you that the hysteric girls cheat so, and the\nprofessionals are such a set of pickpockets, that I can do something\nbetter than hunt for the grains of truth among their tricks and lies. Do\nyou remember what I used to say in my lectures?--or were you asleep\njust then, or cutting your initials on the rail? (You see I can ask\nquestions, my young friend.) Leverage is everything,--was what I used to\nsay;--don't begin to pry till you have got the long arm on your side.\n\nTo please you, and satisfy your doubts as far as possible, I have looked\ninto the old books,--into Schenckius and Turner and Kenelm. Digby and\nthe rest, where I have found plenty of curious stories which you must\ntake for what they are worth.\n\nYour first question I can answer in the affirmative upon pretty good\nauthority. Mizaldus tells, in his \u00e2\u0080\u009cMemorabilia,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the well-known story\nof the girl fed on poisons, who was sent by the king of the Indies to\nAlexander the Great. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen Aristotle saw her eyes sparkling and snapping\nlike those of serpents, he said, 'Look out for yourself, Alexander! this\nis a dangerous companion for you!'\u00e2\u0080\u009d--and sure enough, the young lady\nproved to be a very unsafe person to her friends. Cardanus gets a story\nfrom Avicenna, of a certain man bit by a serpent, who recovered of his\nbite, the snake dying therefrom. This man afterwards had a daughter\nwhom venomous serpents could not harm, though she had a fatal power over\nthem.\n\nI suppose you may remember the statements of old authors about\nZycanthropy, the disease in which men took on the nature and aspect of\nwolves. Actius and Paulus, both men of authority, describe it. Altomaris\ngives a horrid case; and Fincelius mentions one occurring as late as\n1541, the subject of which was captured, still insisting that he was a\nwolf, only that the hair of his hide was turned in! Versipelles, it may\nbe remembered, was the Latin name for these \u00e2\u0080\u009cwere-wolves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs for the cases where rabid persons have barked and bit like dogs,\nthere are plenty of such on record.\n\nMore singular, or at least more rare, is the account given by Andreas\nBaccius, of a man who was struck in the hand by a cock, with his beak,\nand who died on the third day thereafter, looking for all the world like\na fighting-cock, to the great horror of the spectators.\n\nAs to impressions transmitted at a very early period of existence, every\none knows the story of King James's fear of a naked sword, and the way\nit is accounted for. Sir Kenelm Digby says,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI remember when he dubbed\nme Knight, in the ceremony of putting the point of a naked sword upon\nmy shoulder, he could not endure to look upon it, but turned his face\nanother way, insomuch, that, in lieu of touching my shoulder, he had\nalmost thrust the point into my eyes, had not the Duke of Buckingham\nguided his hand aright.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is he, too, who tells the story of the\nmulberry mark upon the neck of a certain lady of high condition, which\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cevery year, to mulberry season, did swell, grow big, and itch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And\nGaffarel mentions the case of a girl born with the figure of a fish on\none of her limbs, of which the wonder was, that, when the girl did eat\nfish, this mark put her to sensible pain. But there is no end to cases\nof this kind, and I could give some of recent date, if necessary,\nlending a certain plausibility at least to the doctrine of transmitted\nimpressions.\n\nI never saw a distinct case of evil eye, though I have seen eyes so bad\nthat they might produce strange effects on very sensitive natures. But\nthe belief in it under various names, fascination, jettcztura, etc., is\nso permanent and universal, from Egypt to Italy, and from the days\nof Solomon to those of Ferdinand of Naples, that there must be some\npeculiarity, to say the least, on which the opinion is based. There is\nvery strong evidence that some such power is exercised by certain of the\nlower animals. Thus, it is stated on good authority that \u00e2\u0080\u009calmost every\nanimal becomes panic-struck at the sight of the rattlesnake, and seems\nat once deprived of the power of motion, or the exercise of its usual\ninstinct of self-preservation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Other serpents seem to share this power\nof fascination, as the Cobra and the Buccephalus Capensis.\n\nSome think that it is nothing but fright; others attribute it to the\n\n               \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrange powers that lie\n          Within the magic circle of the eye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\nas Churchill said, speaking of Garrick.\n\nYou ask me about those mysterious and frightful intimacies between\nchildren and serpents, of which so many instances have been recorded.\nI am sure I cannot tell what to make of them. I have seen several such\naccounts in recent papers, but here is one published in the seventeenth\ncentury, which is as striking as any of the more modern ones:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Herbert Tones of Monmouth, when he was a little Boy, was used to\neat his Milk in a Garden in the Morning, and was no sooner there, but\na large Snake always came, and eat out of the Dish with him, and did so\nfor a considerable time, till one Morning, he striking the Snake on the\nHead, it hissed at him. Upon which he told his Mother that the Baby\n(for so he call'd it) cry'd Hiss at him. His Mother had it kill'd, which\noccasioned him a great Fit of Sickness, and 'twas thought would have\ndy'd, but did recover.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was likewise one \u00e2\u0080\u009cWilliam Writtle, condemned at Maidston Assizes\nfor a double murder, told a Minister that was with him after he was\ncondemned, that his mother told him, that when he was a Child, there\ncrept always to him a Snake, wherever she laid him. Sometimes she would\nconvey him up Stairs, and leave him never so little, she should be sure\nto find a Snake in the Cradle with him, but never perceived it did him\nany harm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOne of the most striking alleged facts connected with the mysterious\nrelation existing between the serpent and-the human species is the\ninfluence which the poison of the Crotulus, taken internally, seemed to\nproduce over the moral faculties, in the experiments instituted by Dr.\nHering at Surinam. There is something frightful in the disposition of\ncertain ophidians, as the whipsnake, which darts at the eyes of cattle\nwithout any apparent provocation or other motive. It is natural enough\nthat the evil principle should have been represented in the form of a\nserpent, but it is strange to think of introducing it into a human being\nlike cow-pox by vaccination.\n\nYou know all about the Psylli, or ancient serpent tamers, I suppose.\nSavary gives an account of the modern serpent-tamers in his \u00e2\u0080\u009cLetters on\nEgypt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These modern jugglers are in the habit of making the venomous\nNaja counterfeit death, lying out straight and stiff, changing it into\na rod, as the ancient magicians did with their serpents, (probably the\nsame animal,) in the time of Moses.\n\nI am afraid I cannot throw much light on \u00e2\u0080\u009cChristabel\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cLamia\u00e2\u0080\u009d by any\ncriticism I can offer. Geraldine, in the former, seems to be simply a\nmalignant witch-woman with the evil eye, but with no absolute ophidian\nrelationship. Lamia is a serpent transformed by magic into a woman. The\nidea of both is mythological, and not in any sense physiological. Some\nwomen unquestionably suggest the image of serpents; men rarely or never.\nI have been struck, like many others, with the ophidian head and eye of\nthe famous Rachel.\n\nYour question about inherited predispositions, as limiting the sphere of\nthe will, and, consequently, of moral accountability, opens a very wide\nrange of speculation. I can give you only a brief abstract of my own\nopinions on this delicate and difficult subject. Crime and sin, being\nthe preserves of two great organized interests, have been guarded\nagainst all reforming poachers with as great jealousy as the Royal\nForests. It is so easy to hang a troublesome fellow! It is so much\nsimpler to consign a soul to perdition, or say masses, for money, to\nsave it, than to take the blame on ourselves for letting it grow up in\nneglect and run to ruin for want of humanizing influences! They hung\npoor, crazy Bellingham for shooting Mr. Perceval. The ordinary of\nNewgate preached to women who were to swing at Tyburn for a petty theft\nas if they were worse than other people,--just as though he would not\nhave been a pickpocket or shoplifter, himself, if he had been born in\na den of thieves and bred up to steal or starve! The English law never\nbegan to get hold of the idea that a crime was not necessarily a sin,\ntill Hadfield, who thought he was the Saviour of mankind, was tried for\nshooting at George the Third;--lucky for him that he did not hit his\nMajesty!\n\nIt is very singular that we recognize all the bodily defects that unfit\na man for military service, and all the intellectual ones that limit his\nrange of thought, but always talk at him as if all his moral powers were\nperfect. I suppose we must punish evil-doers as we extirpate vermin; but\nI don't know that we have any more right to judge them than we have to\njudge rats and mice, which are just as good as cats and weasels, though\nwe think it necessary to treat them as criminals.\n\nThe limitations of human responsibility have never been properly\nstudied, unless it be by the phrenologists. You know from my lectures\nthat I consider phrenology, as taught, a pseudo-science, and not a\nbranch of positive knowledge; but, for all that, we owe it an immense\ndebt. It has melted the world's conscience in its crucible, and cast it\nin a new mould, with features less like those of Moloch and more like\nthose of humanity. If it has failed to demonstrate its system of special\ncorrespondences, it has proved that there are fixed relations between\norganization and mind and character. It has brought out that great\ndoctrine of moral insanity, which has done more to make men charitable\nand soften legal and theological barbarism than any one doctrine that I\ncan think of since the message of peace and good-will to men.\n\nAutomatic action in the moral world; the reflex movement which seems\nto be self-determination, and has been hanged and howled at as such\n(metaphorically) for nobody knows how many centuries: until somebody\nshall study this as Marshall Hall has studied reflex nervous action in\nthe bodily system, I would not give much for men's judgments of each\nothers' characters. Shut up the robber and the defaulter, we must. But\nwhat if your oldest boy had been stolen from his cradle and bred in a\nNorth-Street cellar? What if you are drinking a little too much wine and\nsmoking a little too much tobacco, and your son takes after you, and so\nyour poor grandson's brain being a little injured in physical texture,\nhe loses the fine moral sense on which you pride yourself, and doesn't\nsee the difference between signing another man's name to a draft and his\nown?\n\nI suppose the study of automatic action in the moral world (you see what\nI mean through the apparent contradiction of terms) may be a dangerous\none in the view of many people. It is liable to abuse, no doubt.\nPeople are always glad to, get hold of anything which limits their\nresponsibility. But remember that our moral estimates come down to us\nfrom ancestors who hanged children for stealing forty shillings' worth,\nand sent their souls to perdition for the sin of being born,--who\npunished the unfortunate families of suicides, and in their eagerness\nfor justice executed one innocent person every three years, on the\naverage, as Sir James Mackintosh tells us.\n\nI do not know in what shape the practical question may present itself to\nyou; but I will tell you my rule in life, and I think you will find it\na good one. Treat bad men exactly as if they were insane. They are\nin-sane, out of health, morally. Reason, which is food to sound minds,\nis not tolerated, still less assimilated, unless administered with the\ngreatest caution; perhaps, not at all. Avoid collision with them, so far\nas you honorably can; keep your temper, if you can,--for one angry\nman is as good as another; restrain them from violence, promptly,\ncompletely, and with the least possible injury, just as in the case of\nmaniacs,--and when you have got rid of them, or got them tied hand and\nfoot so that they can do no mischief, sit down and contemplate them\ncharitably, remembering that nine tenths of their' perversity comes from\noutside influences, drunken ancestors, abuse in childhood, bad company,\nfrom which you have happily been preserved, and for some of which you,\nas a member of society, may be fractionally responsible. I think also\nthat there are special influences which work in the brood lake ferments,\nand I have a suspicion that some of those curious old stories I cited\nmay have more recent parallels. Have you ever met with any cases which\nadmitted of a solution like that which I have mentioned?\n\nYours very truly, _____________ _____________\n\n               Bernard Langdon to Philip Staples.\nMY DEAR PHILIP,--\n\nI have been for some months established in this place, turning the\nmain crank of the machinery for the manufactory of accomplishments\nsuperintended by, or rather worked to the profit of, a certain Mr. Silas\nPeckham. He is a poor wretch, with a little thin fishy blood in his\nbody, lean and flat, long-armed and large-handed, thick-jointed\nand thin-muscled,--you know those unwholesome, weak-eyed, half-fed\ncreatures, that look not fit to be round among live folks, and yet not\nquite dead enough to bury. If you ever hear of my being in court to\nanswer to a charge of assault and battery, you may guess that I have\nbeen giving him a thrashing to settle off old scores; for he is a\ntyrant, and has come pretty near killing his principal lady-assistant\nwith overworking her and keeping her out of all decent privileges.\n\nHelen Darley is this lady's name,--twenty two or three years old,\nI should think,--a very sweet, pale woman,--daughter of the usual\ncountry-clergyman,--thrown on her own resources from an early age, and\nthe rest: a common story, but an uncommon person,--very. All conscience\nand sensibility, I should say,--a cruel worker,--no kind of regard for\nherself, seems as fragile and supple as a young willow-shoot, but try\nher and you find she has the spring in her of a steel cross-bow. I am\nglad I happened to come to this place, if it were only for her sake. I\nhave saved that girl's life; I am as sure of it as if I had pulled her\nout of the fire or water.\n\nOf course I'm in love with her, you say,--we always love those whom\nwe have benefited; \u00e2\u0080\u009csaved her life,--her love was the reward of his\ndevotion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d etc., etc., as in a regular set novel. In love, Philip? Well,\nabout that,--I love Helen Darley--very much: there is hardly anybody I\nlove so well. What a noble creature she is! One of those that just go\nright on, do their own work and everybody else's, killing themselves\ninch by inch without ever thinking about it,--singing and dancing\nat their toil when they begin, worn and saddened after a while, but\npressing steadily on, tottering by and by, and catching at the rail by\nthe way-side to help them lift one foot before the other, and at last\nfalling, face down, arms stretched forward.\n\nPhilip, my boy, do you know I am the sort of man that locks his door\nsometimes and cries his heart out of his eyes,--that can sob like a\nwoman and not be ashamed of it? I come of fighting-blood on one side,\nyou know; I think I could be savage on occasion. But I am tender,--more\nand more tender as I come into my fulness of manhood. I don't like\nto strike a man, (laugh, if you like,--I know I hit hard when I do\nstrike,)--but what I can't stand is the sight of these poor, patient,\ntoiling women, who never find out in this life how good they are, and\nnever know what it is to be told they are angels while they still wear\nthe pleasing incumbrances of humanity. I don't know what to make\nof these cases. To think that a woman is never to be a woman again,\nwhatever she may come to as an unsexed angel,--and that she should die\nunloved! Why does not somebody come and carry off this noble woman,\nwaiting here all ready to make a man happy? Philip, do you know the\npathos there is in the eyes of unsought women, oppressed with the burden\nof an inner life unshared? I can see into them now as I could not in\nthose 'earlier days. I sometimes think their pupils dilate on purpose to\nlet my consciousness glide through them; indeed, I dread them, I come so\nclose to the nerve of the soul itself in these momentary intimacies. You\nused to tell me I was a Turk,--that my heart was full of pigeon-holes,\nwith accommodations inside for a whole flock of doves. I don't know but\nI am still as Youngish as ever in my ways,--Brigham-Youngish, I mean;\nat any rate, T. always want to give a little love to all the poor\nthings that cannot have a whole man to themselves. If they would only be\ncontented with a little!\n\nHere now are two girls in this school where I am teaching. One of them,\nRosa M., is not more than sixteen years old, I think they say; but\nNature has forced her into a tropical luxuriance of beauty, as if it\nwere July with her, instead of May. I suppose it is all natural enough\nthat this girl should like a young man's attention, even if he were\na grave schoolmaster; but the eloquence of this young thing's look\nis unmistakable,--and yet she does not know the language it is\ntalking,--they none of them do; and there is where a good many poor\ncreatures of our good-for-nothing sex are mistaken. There is no danger\nof my being rash, but I think this girl will cost somebody his life\nyet. She is one of those women men make a quarrel about and fight to the\ndeath for,--the old feral instinct, you know.\n\nPray, don't think I am lost in conceit, but there is another girl here\nwho I begin to think looks with a certain kindness on me. Her name is\nElsie V., and she is the only daughter and heiress of an old family in\nthis place. She is a portentous and almost fearful creature. If I should\ntell you all I know and half of what I fancy about her, you would\ntell me to get my life insured at once. Yet she is the most painfully\ninteresting being,--so handsome! so lonely!--for she has no friends\namong the girls, and sits apart from them,--with black hair like the\nflow of a mountain-brook after a thaw, with a low-browed, scowling\nbeauty of face, and such eyes as were never seen before, I really\nbelieve, in any human creature.\n\nPhilip, I don't know what to say about this Elsie. There is something\nabout her I have not fathomed. I have conjectures which I could not\nutter to any living soul. I dare not even hint the possibilities which\nhave suggested themselves to me. This I will say, that I do take the\nmost intense interest in this young person, an interest much more like\npity than love in its common sense. If what I guess at is true, of all\nthe tragedies of existence I ever knew this is the saddest, and yet so\nfull of meaning! Do not ask me any questions,--I have said more than\nI meant to already; but I am involved in strange doubts and\nperplexities,--in dangers too, very possibly,--and it is a relief just\nto speak ever so guardedly of them to an early and faithful friend.\n\nYours ever, BERNARD.\n\nP. S. I remember you had a copy of Fortunius Licetus' \u00e2\u0080\u009cDe Monstris\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n among your old books. Can't you lend it to me for a while? I am curious,\nand it will amuse me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. OLD SOPHY CALLS ON THE REVEREND DOCTOR.\n\nThe two meeting-houses which faced each other like a pair of\nfighting-cocks had not flapped their wings or crowed at each other for\na considerable time. The Reverend Mr. Fairweather had been dyspeptic and\nlow-spirited of late, and was too languid for controversy. The Reverend\nDoctor Honeywood had been very busy with his benevolent associations,\nand had discoursed chiefly on practical matters, to the neglect of\nspecial doctrinal subjects. His senior deacon ventured to say to him\nthat some of his people required to be reminded of the great fundamental\ndoctrine of the worthlessness of all human efforts and motives. Some of\nthem were altogether too much pleased with the success of the Temperance\nSociety and the Association for the Relief of the Poor. There was a\npestilent heresy about, concerning the satisfaction to be derived from\na good conscience, as if, anybody ever did anything which was not to be\nhated, loathed, despised, and condemned.\n\nThe old minister listened gravely, with an inward smile, and told his\ndeacon that he would attend to his suggestion. After the deacon had\ngone, he tumbled over his manuscripts, until at length he came upon his\nfirst-rate old sermon on \u00e2\u0080\u009cHuman Nature.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He had read a great deal of\nhard theology, and had at last reached that curious state which is\nso common in good ministers,--that, namely, in which they contrive to\nswitch off their logical faculties on the narrow sidetrack of their\ntechnical dogmas, while the great freight-train of their substantial\nhuman qualities keeps in the main highway of common-sense, in which\nkindly souls are always found by all who approach them by their human\nside.\n\nThe Doctor read his sermon with a pleasant, paternal interest: it was\nwell argued from his premises. Here and there he dashed his pen through\na harsh expression. Now and then he added an explanation or qualified\nabroad statement. But his mind was on the logical side-track, and he\nfollowed the chain of reasoning without fairly perceiving where it would\nlead him, if he carried it into real life.\n\nHe was just touching up the final proposition, when his granddaughter,\nLetty, once before referred to, came into the room with her smiling face\nand lively movement. Miss Letty or Letitia Forrester was a city-bred\ngirl of some fifteen or sixteen years old, who was passing the summer\nwith her grandfather for the sake of country air and quiet. It was a\nsensible arrangement; for, having the promise of figuring as a belle by\nand by, and being a little given to dancing, and having a voice which\ndrew a pretty dense circle around the piano when she sat down to play\nand sing, it was hard to keep her from being carried into society before\nher time, by the mere force of mutual attraction. Fortunately, she had\nsome quiet as well as some social tastes, and was willing enough to pass\ntwo or three of the summer months in the country, where she was much\nbetter bestowed than she would have been at one of those watering-places\nwhere so many half-formed girls get prematurely hardened in the vice of\nself-consciousness.\n\nMiss Letty was altogether too wholesome, hearty, and high-strung a young\ngirl to be a model, according to the flat-chested and cachectic pattern\nwhich is the classical type of certain excellent young females, often\nthe subjects of biographical memoirs. But the old minister was proud of\nhis granddaughter for all that. She was so full of life, so graceful, so\ngenerous, so vivacious, so ready always to do all she could for him and\nfor everybody, so perfectly frank in her avowed delight in the pleasures\nwhich this miserable world offered her in the shape of natural beauty,\nof poetry, of music, of companionship, of books, of cheerful cooperation\nin the tasks of those about her, that the Reverend Doctor could not\nfind it in his heart to condemn her because she was deficient in those\nparticular graces and that signal other-worldliness he had sometimes\nnoticed in feeble young persons suffering from various chronic diseases\nwhich impaired their vivacity and removed them from the range of\ntemptation.\n\nWhen Letty, therefore, came bounding into the old minister's study,\nhe glanced up from his manuscript, and, as his eye fell upon her,\nit flashed across him that there was nothing so very monstrous and\nunnatural about the specimen of congenital perversion he was looking at,\nwith his features opening into their pleasantest sunshine. Technically,\naccording to the fifth proposition of the sermon on Human Nature, very\nbad, no doubt. Practically, according to the fact before him, a very\npretty piece of the Creator's handiwork, body and soul. Was it not a\nconceivable thing that the divine grace might show itself in different\nforms in a fresh young girl like Letitia, and in that poor thing he had\nvisited yesterday, half-grown, half-colored, in bed for the last year\nwith hip-disease?\n\nWas it to be supposed that this healthy young girl, with life throbbing\nall over her, could, without a miracle, be good according to the invalid\npattern and formula?\n\nAnd yet there were mysteries in human nature which pointed to some\ntremendous perversion of its tendencies,--to some profound, radical vice\nof moral constitution, native or transmitted, as you will have it, but\npositive, at any rate, as the leprosy, breaking out in the blood of\nraces, guard them ever so carefully. Did he not know the case of a young\nlady in Rockland, daughter of one of the first families in the place,\na very beautiful and noble creature to look at, for whose bringing up\nnothing had been spared,--a girl who had had governesses to teach her at\nthe house, who had been indulged almost too kindly,--a girl whose father\nhad given himself, up to her, he being himself a pure and high-souled\nman?--and yet this girl was accused in whispers of having been on the\nvery verge of committing a fatal crime; she was an object of fear to\nall who knew the dark hints which had been let fall about her, and there\nwere some that believed--Why, what was this but an instance of the total\nobliquity and degeneration of the moral principle? and to what could it\nbe owing, but to an innate organic tendency?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBusy, grandpapa?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Letty, and without waiting for an answer\nkissed his cheek with a pair of lips made on purpose for that little\nfunction,--fine, but richly turned out, the corners tucked in with a\nfinish of pretty dimples, the rose-bud lips of girlhood's June.\n\nThe old gentleman looked at his granddaughter. Nature swelled up from\nhis heart in a wave that sent a glow to his cheek and a sparkle to his\neye. But it is very hard to be interrupted just as we are winding up a\nstring of propositions with the grand conclusion which is the statement\nin brief of all that has gone before: our own starting-point, into which\nwe have been trying to back our reader or listener as one backs a horse\ninto the shafts.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVideo meliora, proboque,--I see the better, and approve it; deteriora\nsequor, I follow after the worse; 't is that natural dislike to what\nis good, pure, holy, and true, that inrooted selfishness, totally\ninsensible to the claims of\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\nHere the worthy man was interrupted by Miss Letty.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo come, if you can, grandpapa,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young girl; \u00e2\u0080\u009chere is a poor\nold black woman wants to see you so much!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe good minister was as kind-hearted as if he had never groped in the\ndust and ashes of those cruel old abstractions which have killed out so\nmuch of the world's life and happiness. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith the heart man believeth\nunto righteousness;\u00e2\u0080\u009d a man's love is the measure of his fitness for good\nor bad company here or elsewhere. Men are tattooed with their special\nbeliefs like so many South-Sea Islanders; but a real human heart, with\nDivine love in it, beats with the same glow under all, the patterns of\nall earth's thousand tribes!\n\nThe Doctor sighed, and folded the sermon, and laid the Quarto Cruden on\nit. He rose from his desk, and, looking once more at the young girl's\nface, forgot his logical conclusions, and said to himself that she was\na little angel,--which was in violent contradiction to the leading\ndoctrine of his sermon on Human Nature. And so he followed her out of\nthe study into the wide entry of the old-fashioned country-house.\n\nAn old black woman sat on the plain oaken settle which humble visitors\nwaiting to see the minister were wont to occupy. She was old, but how\nold it would be very hard to guess. She might be seventy. She might be\nninety. One could not swear she was not a hundred. Black women remain\nat a stationary age (to the eyes of white people, at least) for thirty\nyears. They do not appear to change during this period any more than\nso many Trenton trilobites. Bent up, wrinkled, yellow-eyed, with long\nupper-lip, projecting jaws, retreating chin, still meek features, long\narms, large flat hands with uncolored palms and slightly webbed\nfingers, it was impossible not to see in this old creature a hint of\nthe gradations by which life climbs up through the lower natures to the\nhighest human developments. We cannot tell such old women's ages because\nwe do not understand the physiognomy of a race so unlike our own.\nNo doubt they see a great deal in each other's faces that we\ncannot,--changes of color and expression as real as our own, blushes and\nsudden betrayals of feeling,--just as these two canaries know what\ntheir single notes and short sentences and full song with this or that\nvariation mean, though it is a mystery to us unplumed mortals.\n\nThis particular old black woman was a striking specimen of her\nclass. Old as she looked, her eye was bright and knowing. She wore a\nred-and-yellow turban, which set off her complexion well, and hoops of\ngold in her ears, and beads of gold about her neck, and an old funeral\nring upon her finger. She had that touching stillness about her which\nbelongs to animals that wait to be spoken to and then look up with a\nkind of sad humility.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Sophy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the good minister, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis this you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe looked up with the still expression on her face. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's ol' Sophy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n she said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI did not believe you could walk so far as this\nto save the Union. Bring Sophy a glass of wine, Letty. Wine's good for\nold folks like Sophy and me, after walking a good way, or preaching a\ngood while.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young girl stepped into the back-parlor, where she found the\ngreat pewter flagon in which the wine that was left after each\ncommunion-service was brought to the minister's house. With much toil\nshe managed to tip it so as to get a couple of glasses filled. The\nminister tasted his, and made old Sophy finish hers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wan' to see you 'n' talk wi' you all alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said presently.\n\nThe minister got up and led the way towards his study. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid; he had only waited for her to rest a moment before he asked her\ninto the library. The young girl took her gently by the arm, and helped\nher feeble steps along the passage. When they reached the study, she\nsmoothed the cushion of a rocking-chair, and made the old woman sit\ndown in it. Then she tripped lightly away, and left her alone with the\nminister.\n\nOld Sophy was a member of the Reverend Doctor Honeywood's church.\nShe had been put through the necessary confessions in a tolerably\nsatisfactory manner. To be sure, as her grandfather had been a cannibal\nchief, according to the common story, and, at any rate, a terrible wild\nsavage, and as her mother retained to the last some of the prejudices\nof her early education, there was a heathen flavor in her Christianity\nwhich had often scandalized the elder of the minister's two deacons.\nBut, the good minister had smoothed matters over: had explained that\nallowances were to be made for those who had been long sitting without\nthe gate of Zion,--that, no doubt, a part of the curse which descended\nto the children of Ham consisted in \u00e2\u0080\u009chaving the understanding darkened,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n as well as the skin,--and so had brought his suspicious senior deacon to\ntolerate old Sophy as one of the communion of fellow-sinners.\n\n--Poor things! How little we know the simple notions with which these\nrudiments of souls are nourished by the Divine Goodness! Did not Mrs.\nProfessor come home this very blessed morning with a story of one of her\nold black women?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd how do you feel to-day, Mrs. Robinson?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, my dear, I have this singing in my head all the time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (What\ndoctors call tinnitus aurium.)\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe 's got a cold in the head,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said old Mrs. Rider.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no, my dear! Whatever I'm thinking about, it's all this singing,\nthis music. When I'm thinking of the dear Redeemer, it all turns into\nthis singing and music. When the clark came to see me, I asked him if\nhe couldn't cure me, and he said, No,--it was the Holy Spirit in me,\nsinging to me; and all the time I hear this beautiful music, and it's\nthe Holy Spirit a-singing to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe good man waited for Sophy to speak; but she did not open her lips as\nyet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope you are not troubled in mind or body,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to her at length,\nfinding she did not speak.\n\nThe poor old woman took out a white handkerchief, and lifted it--to her\nblack face. She could not say a word for her tears and sobs.\n\nThe minister would have consoled her; he was used to tears, and could in\nmost cases withstand their contagion manfully; but something choked\nhis voice suddenly, and when he called upon it, he got no answer, but a\ntremulous movement of the muscles, which was worse than silence.\n\nAt last she spoke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no, no, no! It's my poor girl, my darling, my beauty, my baby,\nthat 's grown up to be a woman; she will come to a bad end; she will do\nsomething that will make them kill her or shut her up all her life. Or,\nDoctor, Doctor, save her, pray for her! It a'n't her fault. It a'n't\nher fault. If they knew all that I know, they would n' blame that poor\nchild. I must tell you, Doctor: if I should die, perhaps nobody else\nwould tell you. Massa Veneer can't talk about it. Doctor Kittredge won't\ntalk about it. Nobody but old Sophy to tell you, Doctor; and old Sophy\ncan't die without telling you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe kind minister soothed the poor old soul with those gentle, quieting\ntones which had carried peace and comfort to so many chambers of\nsickness and sorrow, to so many hearts overburdened by the trials laid\nupon them.\n\nOld Sophy became quiet in a few minutes, and proceeded to tell her\nstory. She told it in the low half-whisper which is the natural voice\nof lips oppressed wish grief and fears; with quick glances around the\napartment from time to time, as if she dreaded lest the dim portraits on\nthe walls and the dark folios on the shelves might overhear her words.\n\nIt was not one of those conversations which a third person can report\nminutely, unless by that miracle of clairvoyance known to the readers\nof stories made out of authors' brains. Yet its main character can be\nimparted in a much briefer space than the old black woman took to give\nall its details.\n\nShe went far back to the time when Dudley Venner was born,--she being\nthen a middle-aged woman. The heir and hope of a family which had been\nnarrowing down as if doomed to extinction, he had been surrounded\nwith every care and trained by the best education he could have in New\nEngland. He had left college, and was studying the profession which\ngentlemen of leisure most affect, when he fell in love with a young girl\nleft in the world almost alone, as he was. The old woman told the story\nof his young love and his joyous bridal with a tenderness which had\nsomething more, even, than her family sympathies to account for it. Had\nshe not hanging over her bed a paper-cutting of a profile,--jet black,\nbut not blacker than the face it represented--of one who would have been\nher own husband in the small years of this century, if the vessel in\nwhich he went to sea, like Jamie in the ballad, had not sailed away and\nnever come back to land? Had she not her bits of furniture stowed away\nwhich had been got ready for her own wedding,--two rocking-chairs,\none worn with long use, one kept for him so long that it had grown a\nsuperstition with her never to sit in it,--and might he not come back\nyet, after all? Had she not her chest of linen ready for her humble\nhouse-keeping with store of serviceable huckaback and piles of neatly\nfolded kerchiefs, wherefrom this one that showed so white against her\nblack face was taken, for that she knew her eyes would betray her in\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe presence\u00e2\u0080\u009d?\n\nAll the first part of the story the old woman told tenderly, and yet\ndwelling upon every incident with a loving pleasure. How happy this\nyoung couple had been, what plans and projects of improvement they had\nformed, how they lived in each other, always together, so young and\nfresh and beautiful as she remembered them in that one early summer when\nthey walked arm in arm through the wilderness of roses that ran riot in\nthe garden,--she told of this as loath to leave it and come to the woe\nthat lay beneath.\n\nShe told the whole story;-shall I repeat it? Not now. If, in the course\nof relating the incidents I have undertaken to report, it tells itself,\nperhaps this will be better than to run the risk of producing a painful\nimpression on some of those susceptible readers whom it would be\nill-advised to disturb or excite, when they rather require to be amused\nand soothed. In our pictures of life, we must show the flowering-out of\nterrible growths which have their roots deep, deep underground. Just\nhow far we shall lay bare the unseemly roots themselves is a matter of\ndiscretion and taste, and which none of us are infallible.\n\nThe old woman told the whole story of Elsie, of her birth, of her\npeculiarities of person and disposition, of the passionate fears and\nhopes with which her father had watched the course of her development.\nShe recounted all her strange ways, from the hour when she first tried\nto crawl across the carpet, and her father's look as she worked her way\ntowards him. With the memory of Juliet's nurse she told the story of\nher teething, and how, the woman to whose breast she had clung dying\nsuddenly about that time, they had to struggle hard with the child\nbefore she would learn the accomplishment of feeding with a spoon. And\nso of her fierce plays and fiercer disputes with that boy who had been\nher companion, and the whole scene of the quarrel when she struck him\nwith those sharp white teeth, frightening her, old Sophy, almost to\ndeath; for, as she said, the boy would have died, if it hadn't been for\nthe old Doctor's galloping over as fast as he could gallop and burning\nthe places right out of his arm. Then came the story of that other\nincident, sufficiently alluded to already, which had produced such\nan ecstasy of fright and left such a nightmare of apprehension in the\nhousehold. And so the old woman came down to this present time. That boy\nshe never loved nor trusted was grown to a dark, dangerous-looking man,\nand he was under their roof. He wanted to marry our poor Elsie, and\nElsie hated him, and sometimes she would look at him over her shoulder\njust as she used to look at that woman she hated; and she, old Sophy,\ncouldn't sleep for thinking she should hear a scream from the white\nchamber some night and find him in spasms such as that woman came so\nnear dying with. And then there was something about Elsie she did not\nknow what to make of: she would sit and hang her head sometimes, and\nlook as if she were dreaming; and she brought home books they said a\nyoung gentleman up at the great school lent her; and once she heard her\nwhisper in her sleep, and she talked as young girls do to themselves\nwhen they're thinking about somebody they have a liking for and think\nnobody knows it.\n\nShe finished her long story at last. The minister had listened to it in\nperfect silence. He sat still even when she had done speaking,--still,\nand lost in thought. It was a very awkward matter for him to have a\nhand in. Old Sophy was his parishioner, but the Veneers had a pew in\nthe Reverend Mr. Fairweather's meeting-house. It would seem that he, Mr.\nFairweather, was the natural adviser of the parties most interested. Had\nhe sense and spirit enough to deal with such people? Was there enough\ncapital of humanity in his somewhat limited nature to furnish sympathy\nand unshrinking service for his friends in an emergency? or was he too\nbusy with his own attacks of spiritual neuralgia, and too much occupied\nwith taking account of stock of his own thin-blooded offences, to forget\nhimself and his personal interests on the small scale and the large,\nand run a risk of his life, if need were, at any rate give himself up\nwithout reserve to the dangerous task of guiding and counselling these\ndistressed and imperilled fellow-creatures?\n\nThe good minister thought the best thing to do would be to call and talk\nover some of these matters with Brother Fairweather,--for so he would\ncall him at times, especially if his senior deacon were not within\nearshot. Having settled this point, he comforted Sophy with a few words\nof counsel and a promise of coming to see her very soon. He then called\nhis man to put the old white horse into the chaise and drive Sophy back\nto the mansion-house.\n\nWhen the Doctor sat down to his sermon again, it looked very differently\nfrom the way it had looked at the moment he left it. When he came to\nthink of it, he did not feel quite so sure practically about that matter\nof the utter natural selfishness of everybody. There was Letty, now,\nseemed to take a very unselfish interest in that old black woman, and\nindeed in poor people generally; perhaps it would not be too much to\nsay that she was always thinking of other people. He thought he had\nseen other young persons naturally unselfish, thoughtful for others; it\nseemed to be a family trait in some he had known.\n\nBut most of all he was exercised about this poor girl whose story Sophy\nhad been telling. If what the old woman believed was true,--and it\nhad too much semblance of probability,--what became of his theory of\ningrained moral obliquity applied to such a case? If by the visitation\nof God a person receives any injury which impairs the intellect or the\nmoral perceptions, is it not monstrous to judge such a person by our\ncommon working standards of right and wrong? Certainly, everybody will\nanswer, in cases where there is a palpable organic change brought about,\nas when a blow on the head produces insanity. Fools! How long will it be\nbefore we shall learn that for every wound which betrays itself to the\nsight by a scar, there are a thousand unseen mutilations that cripple,\neach of them, some one or more of our highest faculties? If what Sophy\ntold and believed was the real truth, what prayers could be agonizing\nenough, what tenderness could be deep enough, for this poor, lost,\nblighted, hapless, blameless child of misfortune, struck by such a doom\nas perhaps no living creature in all the sisterhood of humanity shared\nwith her?\n\nThe minister thought these matters over until his mind was bewildered\nwith doubts and tossed to and fro on that stormy deep of thought heaving\nforever beneath the conflict of windy dogmas. He laid by his old sermon.\nHe put back a pile of old commentators with their eyes and mouths and\nhearts full of the dust of the schools. Then he opened the book of\nGenesis at the eighteenth chapter and read that remarkable argument of\nAbraham's with his Maker in which he boldly appeals to first principles.\nHe took as his text, \u00e2\u0080\u009cShall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n and began to write his sermon, afterwards so famous, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn the Obligations\nof an Infinite Creator to a Finite Creature.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt astonished the good people, who had been accustomed so long to repeat\nmechanically their Oriental hyperboles of self-abasement, to hear their\nworthy minister maintaining that the dignified attitude of the old\nPatriarch, insisting on what was reasonable and fair with reference to\nhis fellow-creatures, was really much more respectful to his Maker, and\na great deal manlier and more to his credit, than if he had yielded the\nwhole matter, and pretended that men had not rights as well as duties.\nThe same logic which had carried him to certain conclusions with\nreference to human nature, this same irresistible logic carried him\nstraight on from his text until he arrived at those other results, which\nnot only astonished his people, as was said, but surprised himself. He\nwent so far in defence of the rights of man, that he put his foot into\nseveral heresies, for which men had been burned so often, it was time,\nif ever it could be, to acknowledge the demonstration of the argumentum\nad ignem. He did not believe in the responsibility of idiots. He did\nnot believe a new-born infant was morally answerable for other people's\nacts. He thought a man with a crooked spine would never be called to\naccount for not walking erect. He thought if the crook was in his brain,\ninstead of his back, he could not fairly be blamed for any consequence\nof this natural defect, whatever lawyers or divines might call it.\nHe argued, that, if a person inherited a perfect mind, body, and\ndisposition, and had perfect teaching from infancy, that person could do\nnothing more than keep the moral law perfectly. But supposing that\nthe Creator allows a person to be born with an hereditary or ingrafted\norganic tendency, and then puts this person into the hands of\nteachers incompetent or positively bad, is not what is called sin or\ntransgression of the law necessarily involved in the premises? Is not\na Creator bound to guard his children against the ruin which inherited\nignorance might entail on them? Would it be fair for a parent to put\ninto a child's hands the title-deeds to all its future possessions, and\na bunch of matches? And are not men children, nay, babes, in the eye\nof Omniscience?--The minister grew bold in his questions. Had not he as\ngood right to ask questions as Abraham?\n\nThis was the dangerous vein of speculation in which the Reverend Doctor\nHoneywood found himself involved, as a consequence of the suggestions\nforced upon him by old Sophy's communication. The truth was, the good\nman had got so humanized by mixing up with other people in various\nbenevolent schemes, that, the very moment he could escape from his old\nscholastic abstractions, he took the side of humanity instinctively,\njust as the Father of the Faithful did,--all honor be to the noble old\nPatriarch for insisting on the worth of an honest man, and making the\nbest terms he could for a very ill-conditioned metropolis, which might\npossibly, however, have contained ten righteous people, for whose sake\nit should be spared!\n\nThe consequence of all this was, that he was in a singular and seemingly\nself-contradictory state of mind when he took his hat and cane and went\nforth to call on his heretical brother. The old minister took it for\ngranted that the Reverend Mr. Fairweather knew the private history of\nhis parishioner's family. He did not reflect that there are griefs\nmen never put into words,--that there are fears which must not be\nspoken,--intimate matters of consciousness which must be carried,\nas bullets which have been driven deep into the living tissues are\nsometimes carried, for a whole lifetime,--encysted griefs, if we may\nborrow the chirurgeon's term, never to be reached, never to be seen,\nnever to be thrown out, but to go into the dust with the frame that\nbore them about with it, during long years of anguish, known only to the\nsufferer and his Maker. Dudley Venner had talked with his minister about\nthis child of his. But he had talked cautiously, feeling his way for\nsympathy, looking out for those indications of tact and judgment which\nwould warrant him in some partial communication, at least, of the origin\nof his doubts and fears, and never finding them.\n\nThere was something about the Reverend Mr. Fairweather which repressed\nall attempts at confidential intercourse. What this something was,\nDudley Venner could hardly say; but he felt it distinctly, and it\nsealed his lips. He never got beyond certain generalities connected\nwith education and religious instruction. The minister could not help\ndiscovering, however, that there were difficulties connected with this\ngirl's management, and he heard enough outside of the family to convince\nhim that she had manifested tendencies, from an early age, at variance\nwith the theoretical opinions he was in the habit of preaching, and in\na dim way of holding for truth, as to the natural dispositions of the\nhuman being.\n\nAbout this terrible fact of congenital obliquity his new beliefs\nbegan to cluster as a centre, and to take form as a crystal around its\nnucleus. Still, he might perhaps have struggled against them, had it not\nbeen for the little Roman Catholic chapel he passed every Sunday, on his\nway to the meeting-house. Such a crowd of worshippers, swarming into the\npews like bees, filling all the aisles, running over at the door like\nberries heaped too full in the measure,--some kneeling on the steps,\nsome standing on the sidewalk, hats off, heads down, lips moving, some\nlooking on devoutly from the other side of the street! Oh, could he\nhave followed his own Bridget, maid of all work, into the heart of that\nsteaming throng, and bowed his head while the priests intoned their\nLatin prayers! could he have snuffed up the cloud of frankincense, and\nfelt that he was in the great ark which holds the better half of the\nChristian world, while all around it are wretched creatures, some\nstruggling against the waves in leaky boats, and some on ill-connected\nrafts, and some with their heads just above water, thinking to ride out\nthe flood which is to sweep the earth clean of sinners, upon their own\nprivate, individual life-preservers!\n\nSuch was the present state of mind of the Reverend Chauncy Fairweather,\nwhen his clerical brother called upon him to talk over the questions to\nwhich old Sophy had called his attention.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. THE REVEREND DOCTOR CALLS ON BROTHER FAIRWEATHER.\n\nFor the last few months, while all these various matters were going on\nin Rockland, the Reverend Chauncy Fairweather had been busy with the\nrecords of ancient councils and the writings of the early fathers. The\nmore he read, the more discontented he became with the platform upon\nwhich he and his people were standing. They and he were clearly in\na minority, and his deep inward longing to be with the majority was\ngrowing into an engrossing passion. He yearned especially towards the\ngood old unquestioning, authoritative Mother Church, with her articles\nof faith which took away the necessity for private judgment, with her\ntraditional forms and ceremonies, and her whole apparatus of stimulants\nand anodynes.\n\nAbout this time he procured a breviary and kept it in his desk under\nthe loose papers. He sent to a Catholic bookstore and obtained a small\ncrucifix suspended from a string of beads. He ordered his new coat to be\ncut very narrow in the collar and to be made single-breasted. He began\nan informal series of religious conversations with Miss O'Brien, the\nyoung person of Irish extraction already referred to as Bridget, maid\nof all work. These not proving very satisfactory, he managed to fall in\nwith Father McShane, the Catholic priest of the Rockland church.\n\nFather McShane encouraged his nibble very scientifically. It would be\nsuch a fine thing to bring over one of those Protestant heretics, and a\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cliberal\u00e2\u0080\u009d one too!--not that there was any real difference between\nthem, but it sounded better, to say that one of these rationalizing\nfree-and-equal religionists had been made a convert than any of those\nhalf-way Protestants who were the slaves of catechisms instead of\ncouncils, and of commentators instead of popes. The subtle priest played\nhis disciple with his finest tackle. It was hardly necessary: when\nanything or anybody wishes to be caught, a bare hook and a coarse line\nare all that is needed.\n\nIf a man has a genuine, sincere, hearty wish to get rid of his liberty,\nif he is really bent upon becoming a slave, nothing can stop him. And\nthe temptation is to some natures a very great one. Liberty is often a\nheavy burden on a man. It involves that necessity for perpetual choice\nwhich is the kind of labor men have always dreaded. In common life we\nshirk it by forming habits, which take the place of self-determination.\nIn politics party-organization saves us the pains of much thinking\nbefore deciding how to cast our vote. In religious matters there are\ngreat multitudes watching us perpetually, each propagandist ready with\nhis bundle of finalities, which having accepted we may be at peace.\nThe more absolute the submission demanded, the stronger the temptation\nbecomes to those who have been long tossed among doubts and conflicts.\n\nSo it is that in all the quiet bays which indent the shores of the great\nocean of thought, at every sinking wharf, we see moored the hulks\nand the razees of enslaved or half-enslaved intelligences. They rock\npeacefully as children in their cradles on the subdued swell which\ncomes feebly in over the bar at the harbor's mouth, slowly crusting with\nbarnacles, pulling at their iron cables as if they really wanted to be\nfree; but better contented to remain bound as they are. For these no\nmore the round unwalled horizon of the open sea, the joyous breeze\naloft, the furrow, the foam, the sparkle, that track the rushing keel!\nThey have escaped the dangers of the wave, and lie still henceforth,\nevermore. Happiest of souls, if lethargy is bliss, and palsy the chief\nbeatitude!\n\nAmerica owes its political freedom to religious Protestantism. But\npolitical freedom is reacting on religious prescription with still\nmightier force. We wonder, therefore, when we find a soul which was\nborn to a full sense of individual liberty, an unchallenged right\nof self-determination on every new alleged truth offered to its\nintelligence, voluntarily surrendering any portion of its liberty to\na spiritual dictatorship which always proves to rest, in the last\nanalysis, on a majority vote, nothing more nor less, commonly an old\none, passed in those barbarous times when men cursed and murdered each\nother for differences of opinion, and of course were not in a condition\nto settle the beliefs of a comparatively civilized community.\n\nIn our disgust, we are liable to be intolerant. We forget that weakness\nis not in itself a sin. We forget that even cowardice may call for our\nmost lenient judgment, if it spring from innate infirmity, Who of us\ndoes not look with great tenderness on the young chieftain in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cFair\nMaid of Perth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d when he confesses his want of courage? All of us love\ncompanionship and sympathy; some of us may love them too much. All of us\nare more or less imaginative in our theology.\n\nSome of us may find the aid of material symbols a comfort, if not a\nnecessity. The boldest thinker may have his moments of languor and\ndiscouragement, when he feels as if he could willingly exchange faiths\nwith the old beldame crossing herself at the cathedral-door,--nay, that,\nif he could drop all coherent thought, and lie in the flowery meadow\nwith the brown-eyed solemnly unthinking cattle, looking up to the sky,\nand all their simple consciousness staining itself blue, then down to\nthe grass, and life turning to a mere greenness, blended with confused\nscents of herbs,--no individual mind-movement such as men are teased\nwith, but the great calm cattle-sense of all time and all places that\nknow the milky smell of herds,--if he could be like these, he would be\ncontent to be driven home by the cow-boy, and share the grassy banquet\nof the king of ancient Babylon. Let us be very generous, then, in our\njudgment of those who leave the front ranks of thought for the company\nof the meek non-combatants who follow with the baggage and provisions.\nAge, illness, too much wear and tear, a half-formed paralysis, may bring\nany of us to this pass. But while we can think and maintain the rights\nof our own individuality against every human combination, let us\nnot forget to caution all who are disposed to waver that there is a\ncowardice which is criminal, and a longing for rest which it is baseness\nto indulge. God help him, over whose dead soul in his living body must\nbe uttered the sad supplication, Requiescat in pace!\n\nA knock at the Reverend Mr. Fairweather's study door called his eyes\nfrom the book on which they were intent. He looked up, as if expecting a\nwelcome guest.\n\nThe Reverend Pierrepont Honeywood, D. D., entered the study of the\nReverend Chauncy Fairweather. He was not the expected guest. Mr.\nFairweather slipped the book he was reading into a half-open drawer,\nand pushed in the drawer. He slid something which rattled under a paper\nlying on the table. He rose with a slight change of color, and welcomed,\na little awkwardly, his unusual visitor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-evening, Brother Fairweather!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Reverend Doctor, in a\nvery cordial, good-humored way. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope I am not spoiling one of those\neloquent sermons I never have a chance to hear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot at all, not at all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the younger clergyman answered, in a languid\ntone, with a kind of habitual half-querulousness which belonged to\nit,--the vocal expression which we meet with now and then, and which\nsays as plainly as so many words could say it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a suffering\nindividual. I am persistently undervalued, wronged, and imposed upon by\nmankind and the powers of the universe generally. But I endure all. I\nendure you. Speak. I listen. It is a burden to me, but I even approve. I\nsacrifice myself. Behold this movement of my lips! It is a smile.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Reverend Doctor knew this forlorn way of Mr. Fairweather's, and\nwas not troubled by it. He proceeded to relate the circumstances of his\nvisit from the old black woman, and the fear she was in about the young\ngirl, who being a parishioner of Mr. Fairweather's, he had thought it\nbest to come over and speak to him about old Sophy's fears and fancies.\n\nIn telling the old woman's story, he alluded only vaguely to those\npeculiar circumstances to which she had attributed so much importance,\ntaking it for granted that the other minister must be familiar with\nthe whole series of incidents she had related. The old minister was\nmistaken, as we have before seen. Mr. Fairweather had been settled in\nthe place only about ten years, and, if he had heard a strange hint now\nand then about Elsie, had never considered it as anything more than\nidle and ignorant, if not malicious, village-gossip. All that he fully\nunderstood was that this had been a perverse and unmanageable child, and\nthat the extraordinary care which had been bestowed on her had been so\nfar thrown away that she was a dangerous, self-willed girl, whom all\nfeared and almost all shunned, as if she carried with her some malignant\ninfluence.\n\nHe replied, therefore, after hearing the story, that Elsie had always\ngiven trouble. There seemed to be a kind of natural obliquity about\nher. Perfectly unaccountable. A very dark case. Never amenable to good\ninfluences. Had sent her good books from the Sunday-school library.\nRemembered that she tore out the frontispiece of one of them, and kept\nit, and flung the book out of the window. It was a picture of\nEve's temptation; and he recollected her saying that Eve was a good\nwoman,--and she'd have done just so, if she'd been there. A very sad\nchild, very sad; bad from infancy. He had talked himself bold, and\nsaid all at once, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoctor, do you know I am almost ready to accept your\ndoctrine of the congenital sinfulness of human nature? I am afraid that\nis the only thing which goes to the bottom of the difficulty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old minister's face did not open so approvingly as Mr. Fairweather\nhad expected.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, yes,--well,--many find comfort in it,--I believe;--there is much\nto be said,--there are many bad people,--and bad children,--I can't\nbe so sure about bad babies,--though they cry very malignantly at\ntimes,--especially if they have the stomach-ache. But I really don't\nknow how to condemn this poor Elsie; she may have impulses that act\nin her like instincts in the lower animals, and so not come under the\nbearing of our ordinary rules of judgment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut this depraved tendency, Doctor,--this unaccountable perverseness.\nMy dear Sir, I am afraid your school is in the right about human nature.\nOh, those words of the Psalmist, 'shapen in iniquity,' and the rest!\nWhat are we to do with them,--we who teach that the soul of a child is\nan unstained white tablet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKing David was very subject to fits of humility, and much given to\nself-reproaches,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, in a rather dry way. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe owe you and\nyour friends a good deal for calling attention to the natural graces,\nwhich, after all, may, perhaps, be considered as another form of\nmanifestation of the divine influence. Some of our writers have pressed\nrather too hard on the tendencies of the human soul toward evil as such.\nIt maybe questioned whether these views have not interfered with the\nsound training of certain young persons, sons of clergymen and others.\nI am nearer of your mind about the possibility of educating children so\nthat they shall become good Christians without any violent transition.\nThat is what I should hope for from bringing them up 'in the nurture and\nadmonition of the Lord.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe younger minister looked puzzled, but presently answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPossibly\nwe may have called attention to some neglected truths; but, after all, I\nfear we must go to the old school, if we want to get at the root of the\nmatter. I know there is an outward amiability about many young persons,\nsome young girls especially, that seems like genuine goodness; but I\nhave been disposed of late to lean toward your view, that these human\naffections, as we see them in our children,--ours, I say, though I have\nnot the fearful responsibility of training any of my own,--are only a\nkind of disguised and sinful selfishness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old minister groaned in spirit. His heart had been softened by\nthe sweet influences of children and grandchildren. He thought of\na half-sized grave in the burial-ground, and the fine, brave,\nnoble-hearted boy he laid in it thirty years before,--the sweet,\ncheerful child who had made his home all sunshine until the day when he\nwas brought into it, his long curls dripping, his fresh lips purpled in\ndeath,--foolish dear little blessed creature to throw himself into the\ndeep water to save the drowning boy, who clung about him and carried him\nunder! Disguised selfishness! And his granddaughter too, whose disguised\nselfishness was the light of his household!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon't call it my view!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbstractly, perhaps, all natures may\nbe considered vitiated; but practically, as I see it in life, the divine\ngrace keeps pace with the perverted instincts from infancy in many\nnatures. Besides, this perversion itself may often be disease, bad\nhabits transmitted, like drunkenness, or some hereditary misfortune, as\nwith this Elsie we were talking about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe younger minister was completely mystified. At every step he made\ntowards the Doctor's recognized theological position, the Doctor took\njust one step towards his. They would cross each other soon at this\nrate, and might as well exchange pulpits,--as Colonel Sprowle once\nwished they would, it may be remembered.\n\nThe Doctor, though a much clearer-headed man, was almost equally\npuzzled. He turned the conversation again upon Elsie, and endeavored\nto make her minister feel the importance of bringing every friendly\ninfluence to bear upon her at this critical period of her life. His\nsympathies did not seem so lively as the Doctor could have wished.\nPerhaps he had vastly more important objects of solicitude in his own\nspiritual interests.\n\nA knock at the door interrupted them. The Reverend Mr. Fairweather rose\nand went towards it. As he passed the table, his coat caught something,\nwhich came rattling to the floor. It was a crucifix with a string of\nbeads attached. As he opened the door, the Milesian features of Father\nMcShane presented themselves, and from their centre proceeded the\nclerical benediction in Irish-sounding Latin, Pax vobiscum!\n\nThe Reverend Doctor Honeywood rose and left the priest and his disciple\ntogether.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. THE SPIDER ON HIS THREAD.\n\nThere was nobody, then, to counsel poor Elsie, except her father,\nwho had learned to let her have her own way so as not to disturb such\nrelations as they had together, and the old black woman, who had a\nreal, though limited influence over the girl. Perhaps she did not need\ncounsel. To look upon her, one might well suppose that she was\ncompetent to defend herself against any enemy she was like to have. That\nglittering, piercing eye was not to be softened by a few smooth words\nspoken in low tones, charged with the common sentiments which win their\nway to maidens' hearts. That round, lithe, sinuous figure was as full\nof dangerous life as ever lay under the slender flanks and clean-shaped\nlimbs of a panther.\n\nThere were particular times when Elsie was in such a mood that it must\nhave been a bold person who would have intruded upon her with reproof or\ncounsel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is one of her days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d old Sophy would say quietly to her\nfather, and he would, as far as possible, leave her to herself. These\ndays were more frequent, as old Sophy's keen, concentrated watchfulness\nhad taught her, at certain periods of the year. It was in the heats of\nsummer that they were most common and most strongly characterized. In\nwinter, on the other hand, she was less excitable, and even at times\nheavy and as if chilled and dulled in her sensibilities. It was a\nstrange, paroxysmal kind of life that belonged to her. It seemed to come\nand go with the sunlight. All winter long she would be comparatively\nquiet, easy to manage, listless, slow in her motions; her eye would lose\nsomething of its strange lustre; and the old nurse would feel so little\nanxiety, that her whole expression and aspect would show the change, and\npeople would say to her, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Sophy, how young you're looking!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs the spring came on, Elsie would leave the fireside, have her\ntiger-skin spread in the empty southern chamber next the wall, and lie\nthere basking for whole hours in the sunshine. As the season warmed, the\nlight would kindle afresh in her eyes, and the old woman's sleep would\ngrow restless again,--for she knew, that, so long as the glitter\nwas fierce in the girl's eyes, there was no trusting her impulses or\nmovements.\n\nAt last, when the veins of the summer were hot and swollen, and the\njuices of all the poison-plants and the blood of all the creatures that\nfeed upon them had grown thick and strong,--about the time when the\nsecond mowing was in hand, and the brown, wet-faced men were following\nup the scythes as they chased the falling waves of grass, (falling as\nthe waves fall on sickle-curved beaches; the foam-flowers dropping\nas the grass-flowers drop,--with sharp semivowel consonantal\nsounds,--frsh,--for that is the way the sea talks, and leaves all pure\nvowel-sounds for the winds to breathe over it, and all mutes to the\nunyielding earth,)--about this time of over-ripe midsummer, the life of\nElsie seemed fullest of its malign and restless instincts. This was\nthe period of the year when the Rockland people were most cautious of\nwandering in the leafier coverts which skirted the base of The Mountain,\nand the farmers liked to wear thick, long boots, whenever they went\ninto the bushes. But Elsie was never so much given to roaming over\nThe Mountain as at this season; and as she had grown more absolute and\nuncontrollable, she was as like to take the night as the day for her\nrambles.\n\nAt this season, too, all her peculiar tastes in dress and ornament came\nout in a more striking way than at other times. She was never so superb\nas then, and never so threatening in her scowling beauty. The barred\nskirts she always fancied showed sharply beneath her diaphanous muslins;\nthe diamonds often glittered on her breast as if for her own pleasure\nrather than to dazzle others; the asp-like bracelet hardly left her arm.\nShe was never seen without some necklace,--either the golden cord she\nwore at the great party, or a chain of mosaics, or simply a ring of\ngolden scales. Some said that Elsie always slept in a necklace, and that\nwhen she died she was to be buried in one. It was a fancy of hers,--but\nmany thought there was a reason for it.\n\nNobody watched Elsie with a more searching eye than her cousin, Dick\nVenner. He had kept more out of her way of late, it is true, but there\nwas not a movement she made which he did not carefully observe just so\nfar as he could without exciting her suspicion. It was plain enough to\nhim that the road to fortune was before him, and that the first thing\nwas to marry Elsie. What course he should take with her, or with others\ninterested, after marrying her, need not be decided in a hurry.\n\nHe had now done all he could expect to do at present in the way of\nconciliating the other members of the household. The girl's father\ntolerated him, if he did not even like him. Whether he suspected his\nproject or not Dick did not feel sure; but it was something to have got\na foothold in the house, and to have overcome any prepossession against\nhim which his uncle might have entertained. To be a good listener and\na bad billiard-player was not a very great sacrifice to effect this\nobject. Then old Sophy could hardly help feeling well-disposed towards\nhim, after the gifts he had bestowed on her and the court he had paid\nher. These were the only persons on the place of much importance to gain\nover. The people employed about the house and farm-lands had little to\ndo with Elsie, except to obey her without questioning her commands.\n\nMr. Richard began to think of reopening his second parallel. But he had\nlost something of the coolness with which he had begun his system of\noperations. The more he had reflected upon the matter, the more he had\nconvinced himself that this was his one great chance in life. If he\nsuffered this girl to escape him, such an opportunity could hardly,\nin the nature of things, present itself a second time. Only one life\nbetween Elsie and her fortune,--and lives are so uncertain! The girl\nmight not suit him as a wife. Possibly. Time enough to find out after he\nhad got her. In short, he must have the property, and Elsie Venner,\nas she was to go with it,--and then, if he found it convenient and\nagreeable to, lead a virtuous life, he would settle down and\nraise children and vegetables; but if he found it inconvenient and\ndisagreeable, so much the worse for those who made it so. Like many\nother persons, he was not principled against virtue, provided virtue\nwere a better investment than its opposite; but he knew that there\nmight be contingencies in which the property would be better without its\nincumbrances, and he contemplated this conceivable problem in the light\nof all its possible solutions.\n\nOne thing Mr. Richard could not conceal from himself: Elsie had some\nnew cause of indifference, at least, if not of aversion to him. With the\nacuteness which persons who make a sole business of their own interest\ngain by practice, so that fortune-hunters are often shrewd where real\nlovers are terribly simple, he fixed at once on the young man up at the\nschool where the girl had been going of late, as probably at the bottom\nof it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCousin Elsie in love!\u00e2\u0080\u009d so he communed with himself upon his lonely\npillow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn love with a Yankee schoolmaster! What else can it be? Let\nhim look out for himself! He'll stand but a bad chance between us. What\nmakes you think she's in love with him? Met her walking with him. Don't\nlike her looks and ways;--she's thinking about something, anyhow.\nWhere does she get those books she is reading so often? Not out of our\nlibrary, that 's certain. If I could have ten minutes' peep into her\nchamber now, I would find out where she got them, and what mischief she\nwas up to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt that instant, as if some tributary demon had heard his wish, a shape\nwhich could be none but Elsie's flitted through a gleam of moonlight\ninto the shadow of the trees. She was setting out on one of her midnight\nrambles.\n\nDick felt his heart stir in its place, and presently his cheeks flushed\nwith the old longing for an adventure. It was not much to invade a young\ngirl's deserted chamber, but it would amuse a wakeful hour, and tell him\nsome little matters he wanted to know. The chamber he slept in was over\nthe room which Elsie chiefly occupied at this season. There was no\ngreat risk of his being seen or heard, if he ventured down-stairs to her\napartment.\n\nMr. Richard Venner, in the pursuit of his interesting project, arose\nand lighted a lamp. He wrapped himself in a dressing-gown and thrust his\nfeet into a pair of cloth slippers. He stole carefully down the stair,\nand arrived safely at the door of Elsie's room.\n\nThe young lady had taken the natural precaution to leave it fastened,\ncarrying the key with her, no doubt,--unless; indeed, she had got out by\nthe window, which was not far from the ground. Dick could get in at\nthis window easily enough, but he did not like the idea of leaving\nhis footprints in the flower-bed just under it. He returned to his own\nchamber, and held a council of war with himself.\n\nHe put his head out of his own window and looked at that beneath. It was\nopen. He then went to one of his trunks, which he unlocked, and began\ncarefully removing its contents. What these were we need not stop to\nmention,--only remarking that there were dresses of various patterns,\nwhich might afford an agreeable series of changes, and in certain\ncontingencies prove eminently useful. After removing a few of these, he\nthrust his hand to the very bottom of the remaining pile and drew out\na coiled strip of leather many yards in length, ending in a noose,--a\ntough, well-seasoned lasso, looking as if it had seen service and was\nnone the worse for it. He uncoiled a few yards of this and fastened it\nto the knob of a door. Then he threw the loose end out of the window so\nthat it should hang by the open casement of Elsie's room. By this he let\nhimself down opposite her window, and with a slight effort swung himself\ninside the room. He lighted a match, found a candle, and, having lighted\nthat, looked curiously about him, as Clodius might have done when he\nsmuggled himself in among the Vestals.\n\nElsie's room was almost as peculiar as her dress and ornaments. It was\na kind of museum of objects, such as the woods are full of to those who\nhave eyes to see them, but many of them such as only few could hope to\nreach, even if they knew where to look for them. Crows' nests, which\nare never found but in the tall trees, commonly enough in the forks of\nancient hemlocks, eggs of rare birds, which must have taken a quick eye\nand a hard climb to find and get hold of, mosses and ferns of unusual\naspect, and quaint monstrosities of vegetable growth, such as Nature\ndelights in, showed that Elsie had her tastes and fancies like any\nnaturalist or poet.\n\nNature, when left to her own freaks in the forest, is grotesque and\nfanciful to the verge of license, and beyond it. The foliage of trees\ndoes not always require clipping to make it look like an image of life.\nFrom those windows at Canoe Meadow, among the mountains, we could see\nall summer long a lion rampant, a Shanghai chicken, and General Jackson\non horseback, done by Nature in green leaves, each with a single tree.\nBut to Nature's tricks with boughs and roots and smaller vegetable\ngrowths there is no end. Her fancy is infinite, and her humor not always\nrefined. There is a perpetual reminiscence of animal life in her rude\ncaricatures, which sometimes actually reach the point of imitating the\ncomplete human figure, as in that extraordinary specimen which nobody\nwill believe to be genuine, except the men of science, and of which the\ndiscreet reader may have a glimpse by application in the proper quarter.\n\nElsie had gathered so many of these sculpture-like monstrosities, that\none might have thought she had robbed old Sophy's grandfather of his\nfetishes. They helped to give her room a kind of enchanted look, as if\na witch had her home in it. Over the fireplace was a long, staff-like\nbranch, strangled in the spiral coils of one of those vines which strain\nthe smaller trees in their clinging embraces, sinking into the bark\nuntil the parasite becomes almost identified with its support. With\nthese sylvan curiosities were blended objects of art, some of them not\nless singular, but others showing a love for the beautiful in form\nand color, such as a girl of fine organization and nice culture might\nnaturally be expected to feel and to indulge, in adorning her apartment.\n\nAll these objects, pictures, bronzes, vases, and the rest, did not\ndetain Mr. Richard Veneer very long, whatever may have been his\nsensibilities to art. He was more curious about books and papers. A copy\nof Keats lay on the table. He opened it and read the name of Bernard\nC. Langdon on the blank leaf. An envelope was on the table with Elsie's\nname written in a similar hand; but the envelope was empty, and he could\nnot find the note it contained. Her desk was locked, and it would not be\nsafe to tamper with it. He had seen enough; the girl received books\nand notes from this fellow up at the school, this usher, this Yankee\nquill-driver;--he was aspiring to become the lord of the Dudley domain,\nthen, was he?\n\nElsie had been reasonably careful. She had locked up her papers,\nwhatever they might be. There was little else that promised to\nreward his curiosity, but he cast his eye on everything. There was a\nclasp-Bible among her books. Dick wondered if she ever unclasped it.\nThere was a book of hymns; it had her name in it, and looked as if it\nmight have been often read;--what the diablo had Elsie to do with hymns?\n\nMr. Richard Venner was in an observing and analytical state of mind, it\nwill be noticed, or he might perhaps have been touched with the innocent\nbetrayals of the poor girl's chamber. Had she, after all, some human\ntenderness in her heart? That was not the way he put the question,--but\nwhether she would take seriously to this schoolmaster, and if she did,\nwhat would be the neatest and surest and quickest way of putting a stop\nto all that nonsense. All this, however, he could think over more safely\nin his own quarters. So he stole softly to the window, and, catching\nthe end of the leathern thong, regained his own chamber and drew in the\nlasso.\n\nIt needs only a little jealousy to set a man on who is doubtful in love\nor wooing, or to make him take hold of his courting in earnest. As soon\nas Dick had satisfied himself that the young schoolmaster was his rival\nin Elsie's good graces, his whole thoughts concentrated themselves more\nthan ever on accomplishing his great design of securing her for himself.\nThere was no time to be lost. He must come into closer relations with\nher, so as to withdraw her thoughts from this fellow, and to find out\nmore exactly what was the state of her affections, if she had any. So he\nbegan to court her company again, to propose riding with her, to sing to\nher, to join her whenever she was strolling about the grounds, to make\nhimself agreeable, according to the ordinary understanding of that\nphrase, in every way which seemed to promise a chance for succeeding in\nthat amiable effort.\n\nThe girl treated him more capriciously than ever. She would be sullen\nand silent, or she would draw back fiercely at some harmless word or\ngesture, or she would look at him with her eyes narrowed in such a\nstrange way and with such a wicked light in them that Dick swore to\nhimself they were too much for him, and would leave her for the moment.\nYet she tolerated him, almost as a matter of necessity, and sometimes\nseemed to take a kind of pleasure in trying her power upon him. This he\nsoon found out, and humored her in the fancy that she could exercise\na kind of fascination over him, though there were times in which he\nactually felt an influence he could not understand, an effect of some\npeculiar expression about her, perhaps, but still centring in those\ndiamond eyes of hers which it made one feel so curiously to look into.\n\nWhether Elsie saw into his object or not was more than he could tell.\nHis idea was, after having conciliated the good-will of all about her as\nfar as possible, to make himself first a habit and then a necessity\nwith the girl,--not to spring any trap of a declaration upon her until\ntolerance had grown into such a degree of inclination as her nature was\nlike to admit. He had succeeded in the first part of his plan. He was at\nliberty to prolong his visit at his own pleasure. This was not strange;\nthese three persons, Dudley Venner, his daughter, and his nephew,\nrepresented all that remained of an old and honorable family. Had\nElsie been like other girls, her father might have been less willing\nto entertain a young fellow like Dick as an inmate; but he had long\noutgrown all the slighter apprehensions which he might have had in\ncommon with all parents, and followed rather than led the imperious\ninstincts of his daughter. It was not a question of sentiment, but of\nlife and death, or more than that,--some dark ending, perhaps, which\nwould close the history of his race with disaster and evil report upon\nthe lips of all coming generations.\n\nAs to the thought of his nephew's making love to his daughter, it had\nalmost passed from his mind. He had been so long in the habit of looking\nat Elsie as outside of all common influences and exceptional in the law\nof her nature, that it was difficult for him to think of her as a girl\nto be fallen in love with. Many persons are surprised, when others\ncourt their female relatives; they know them as good young or old women\nenough,--aunts, sisters, nieces, daughters, whatever they may be,--but\nnever think of anybody's falling in love with them, any more than of\ntheir being struck by lightning. But in this case there were special\nreasons, in addition to the common family delusion,--reasons which\nseemed to make it impossible that she should attract a suitor. Who would\ndare to marry Elsie? No, let her have the pleasure, if it was one, at\nany rate the wholesome excitement, of companionship; it might save her\nfrom lapsing into melancholy or a worse form of madness. Dudley Venner\nhad a kind of superstition, too, that, if Elsie could only outlive three\nseptenaries, twenty-one years, so that, according to the prevalent idea,\nher whole frame would have been thrice made over, counting from her\nbirth, she would revert to the natural standard of health of mind and\nfeelings from which she had been so long perverted. The thought of any\nother motive than love being sufficient to induce Richard to become\nher suitor had not occurred to him. He had married early, at that happy\nperiod when interested motives are least apt to influence the choice;\nand his single idea of marriage was, that it was the union of persons\nnaturally drawn towards each other by some mutual attraction. Very\nsimple, perhaps; but he had lived lonely for many years since his wife's\ndeath, and judged the hearts of others, most of all of his brother's\nson, by his own. He had often thought whether, in case of Elsie's dying\nor being necessarily doomed to seclusion, he might not adopt this nephew\nand make him his heir; but it had not occurred to him that Richard might\nwish to become his son-in-law for the sake of his property.\n\nIt is very easy to criticise other people's modes of dealing with their\nchildren. Outside observers see results; parents see processes. They\nnotice the trivial movements and accents which betray the blood of\nthis or that ancestor; they can detect the irrepressible movement of\nhereditary impulse in looks and acts which mean nothing to the common\nobserver. To be a parent is almost to be a fatalist. This boy sits\nwith legs crossed, just as his uncle used to whom he never saw; his\ngrandfathers both died before he was born, but he has the movement of\nthe eyebrows which we remember in one of them, and the gusty temper\nof three different generations, can tell pretty nearly the range of\npossibilities and the limitations of a child, actual or potential, of a\ngiven stock,--errors excepted always, because children of the same stock\nare not bred just alike, because the traits of some less known ancestor\nare liable to break out at any time, and because each human being has,\nafter all, a small fraction of individuality about him which gives him a\nflavor, so that he is distinguishable from others by his friends or in a\ncourt of justice, and which occasionally makes a genius or a saint or a\ncriminal of him. It is well that young persons cannot read these fatal\noracles of Nature. Blind impulse is her highest wisdom, after all. We\nmake our great jump, and then she takes the bandage off our eyes.\nThat is the way the broad sea-level of average is maintained, and the\nphysiological democracy is enabled to fight against the principle\nof selection which would disinherit all the weaker children. The\nmagnificent constituency of mediocrities of which the world is made\nup,--the people without biographies, whose lives have made a clear\nsolution in the fluid menstruum of time, instead of being precipitated\nin the opaque sediment of history--\n\nBut this is a narrative, and not a disquisition.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. FROM WITHOUT AND FROM WITHIN.\n\nThere were not wanting people who accused Dudley VENNER of weakness and\nbad judgment in his treatment of his daughter. Some were of opinion that\nthe great mistake was in not \u00e2\u0080\u009cbreaking her will\u00e2\u0080\u009d when she was a little\nchild. There was nothing the matter with her, they said, but that she\nhad been spoiled by indulgence. If they had had the charge of her,\nthey'd have brought her down. She'd got the upperhand of her father now;\nbut if he'd only taken hold of her in season! There are people who think\nthat everything may be done, if the doer, be he educator or physician,\nbe only called \u00e2\u0080\u009cin season.\u00e2\u0080\u009d No doubt,--but in season would often be a\nhundred or two years before the child was born; and people never send so\nearly as that.\n\nThe father of Elsie Veneer knew his duties and his difficulties too well\nto trouble himself about anything others might think or say. So soon\nas he found that he could not govern his child, he gave his life up to\nfollowing her and protecting her as far as he could. It was a stern and\nterrible trial for a man of acute sensibility, and not without force\nof intellect and will, and the manly ambition for himself and his\nfamily-name which belonged to his endowments and his position. Passive\nendurance is the hardest trial to persons of such a nature.\n\nWhat made it still more a long martyrdom was the necessity for bearing\nhis cross in utter loneliness. He could not tell his griefs. He could\nnot talk of them even with those who knew their secret spring. His\nminister had the unsympathetic nature which is common in the meaner sort\nof devotees,--persons who mistake spiritual selfishness for sanctity,\nand grab at the infinite prize of the great Future and Elsewhere with\nthe egotism they excommunicate in its hardly more odious forms of\navarice and self-indulgence. How could he speak with the old physician\nand the old black woman about a sorrow and a terror which but to name\nwas to strike dumb the lips of Consolation?\n\nIn the dawn of his manhood he had found that second consciousness for\nwhich young men and young women go about looking into each other's\nfaces, with their sweet, artless aim playing in every feature, and\nmaking them beautiful to each other, as to all of us. He had found his\nother self early, before he had grown weary in the search and wasted his\nfreshness in vain longings: the lot of many, perhaps we may say of most,\nwho infringe the patent of our social order by intruding themselves\ninto a life already upon half allowance of the necessary luxuries of\nexistence. The life he had led for a brief space was not only beautiful\nin outward circumstance, as old Sophy had described it to the Reverend\nDoctor. It was that delicious process of the tuning of two souls to each\nother, string by string, not without little half-pleasing discords now\nand then when some chord in one or the other proves to be overstrained\nor over-lax, but always approaching nearer and nearer to harmony, until\nthey become at last as two instruments with a single voice. Something\nmore than a year of this blissful doubled consciousness had passed over\nhim when he found himself once more alone,--alone, save for the little\ndiamond-eyed child lying in the old black woman's arms, with the coral\nnecklace round--her throat and the rattle in her hand.\n\nHe would not die by his own act. It was not the way in his family. There\nmay have been other, perhaps better reasons, but this was enough; he did\nnot come of suicidal stock. He must live for this child's sake, at any\nrate; and yet,--oh, yet, who could tell with what thoughts he looked\nupon her? Sometimes her little features would look placid, and something\nlike a smile would steal over them; then all his tender feelings would\nrush up, into his eyes, and he would put his arms out to take her from\nthe old woman,--but all at once her eyes would narrow and she would\nthrow her head back, and a shudder would seize him as he stooped over\nhis child,--he could not look upon her,--he could not touch his lips to\nher cheek; nay, there would sometimes come into his soul such frightful\nsuggestions that he would hurry from the room lest the hinted thought\nshould become a momentary madness and he should lift his hand against\nthe hapless infant which owed him life.\n\nIn those miserable days he used to wander all over The Mountain in his\nrestless endeavor to seek some relief for inward suffering in outward\naction. He had no thought of throwing himself from the summit of any of\nthe broken cliffs, but he clambered over them recklessly, as having no\nparticular care for his life. Sometimes he would go into the accursed\ndistrict where the venomous reptiles were always to be dreaded, and\ncourt their worst haunts, and kill all he could come near with a kind of\nblind fury which was strange in a person of his gentle nature.\n\nOne overhanging cliff was a favorite haunt of his. It frowned upon\nhis home beneath in a very menacing way; he noticed slight seams and\nfissures that looked ominous;--what would happen, if it broke off some\ntime or other and came crashing down on the fields and roofs below? He\nthought of such a possible catastrophe with a singular indifference, in\nfact with a feeling almost like pleasure. It would be such a swift and\nthorough solution of this great problem of life he was working out\nin ever-recurring daily anguish! The remote possibility of such a\ncatastrophe had frightened some timid dwellers beneath The Mountain to\nother places of residence; here the danger was most imminent, and yet he\nloved to dwell upon the chances of its occurrence. Danger is often the\nbest counterirritant in cases of mental suffering; he found a solace in\ncareless exposure of his life, and learned to endure the trials of each\nday better by dwelling in imagination on the possibility that it might\nbe the last for him and the home that was his.\n\nTime, the great consoler, helped these influences, and he gradually fell\ninto more easy and less dangerous habits of life. He ceased from his\nmore perilous rambles. He thought less of the danger from the great\noverhanging rocks and forests; they had hung there for centuries; it\nwas not very likely they would crash or slide in his time. He became\naccustomed to all Elsie's strange looks and ways. Old Sophy dressed her\nwith ruffles round her neck, and hunted up the red coral branch with\nsilver bells which the little toothless Dudleys had bitten upon for\na hundred years. By an infinite effort, her father forced himself to\nbecome the companion of this child, for whom he had such a mingled\nfeeling, but whose presence was always a trial to him, and often a\nterror.\n\nAt a cost which no human being could estimate, he had done his duty, and\nin some degree reaped his reward. Elsie grew up with a kind of filial\nfeeling for him, such as her nature was capable of. She never would obey\nhim; that was not to be looked for. Commands, threats, punishments, were\nout of the question with her; the mere physical effects of crossing her\nwill betrayed themselves in such changes of expression and manner that\nit would have been senseless to attempt to govern her in any such way.\nLeaving her mainly to herself, she could be to some extent indirectly\ninfluenced,--not otherwise. She called her father \u00e2\u0080\u009cDudley,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as if he had\nbeen her brother. She ordered everybody and would be ordered by none.\n\nWho could know all these things, except the few people of the household?\nWhat wonder, therefore, that ignorant and shallow persons laid the blame\non her father of those peculiarities which were freely talked about,--of\nthose darker tendencies which were hinted of in whispers? To all this\ntalk, so far as it reached him, he was supremely indifferent, not only\nwith the indifference which all gentlemen feel to the gossip of their\ninferiors, but with a charitable calmness which did not wonder or blame.\nHe knew that his position was not simply a difficult, but an impossible\none, and schooled himself to bear his destiny as well as he might, and\nreport himself only at Headquarters.\n\nHe had grown gentle under this discipline. His hair was just beginning\nto be touched with silver, and his expression was that of habitual\nsadness and anxiety. He had no counsellor, as we have seen, to turn to,\nwho did not know either too much or too little. He had no heart to rest\nupon and into which he might unburden himself of the secrets and the\nsorrows that were aching in his own breast. Yet he had not allowed\nhimself to run to waste in the long time since he was left alone to\nhis trials and fears. He had resisted the seductions which always beset\nsolitary men with restless brains overwrought by depressing agencies.\nHe disguised no misery to himself with the lying delusion of wine. He\nsought no sleep from narcotics, though he lay with throbbing, wide-open\neyes through all the weary hours of the night.\n\nIt was understood between Dudley Veneer and old Doctor Kittredge that\nElsie was a subject of occasional medical observation, on account of\ncertain mental peculiarities which might end in a permanent affection of\nher reason. Beyond this nothing was said, whatever may have been in the\nmind of either. But Dudley Veneer had studied Elsie's case in the\nlight of all the books he could find which might do anything towards\nexplaining it. As in all cases where men meddle with medical science\nfor a special purpose, having no previous acquaintance with it, his\nimagination found what it wanted in the books he read, and adjusted it\nto the facts before him. So it was he came to cherish those two fancies\nbefore alluded to that the ominous birthmark she had carried from\ninfancy might fade and become obliterated, and that the age of complete\nmaturity might be signalized by an entire change in her physical and\nmental state. He held these vague hopes as all of us nurse our only\nhalf-believed illusions. Not for the world would he have questioned his\nsagacious old medical friend as to the probability or possibility of\ntheir being true. We are very shy of asking questions of those who know\nenough to destroy with one word the hopes we live on.\n\nIn this life of comparative seclusion to which the father had doomed\nhimself for the sake of his child, he had found time for large and\nvaried reading. The learned Judge Thornton confessed himself surprised\nat the extent of Dudley Veneer's information. Doctor Kittredge found\nthat he was in advance of him in the knowledge of recent physiological\ndiscoveries. He had taken pains to become acquainted with agricultural\nchemistry; and the neighboring farmers owed him some useful hints about\nthe management of their land. He renewed his old acquaintance with the\nclassic authors. He loved to warm his pulses with Homer and calm them\ndown with Horace. He received all manner of new books and periodicals,\nand gradually gained an interest in the events of the passing time.\nYet he remained almost a hermit, not absolutely refusing to see his\nneighbors, nor even churlish towards them, but on the other hand not\ncultivating any intimate relations with them.\n\nHe had retired from the world a young man, little more than a\nyouth, indeed, with sentiments and aspirations all of them suddenly\nextinguished. The first had bequeathed him a single huge sorrow, the\nsecond a single trying duty. In due time the anguish had lost something\nof its poignancy, the light of earlier and happier memories had begun to\nstruggle with and to soften its thick darkness, and even that duty which\nhe had confronted with such an effort had become an endurable habit.\n\nAt a period of life when many have been living on the capital of their\nacquired knowledge and their youthful stock of sensibilities until their\nintellects are really shallower and their hearts emptier than they were\nat twenty, Dudley Veneer was stronger in thought and tenderer in soul\nthan in the first freshness of his youth, when he counted but half his\npresent years. He had entered that period which marks the decline of men\nwho have ceased growing in knowledge and strength: from forty to fifty\na man must move upward, or the natural falling off in the vigor of life\nwill carry him rapidly downward. At this time his inward: nature was\nricher and deeper than in any earlier period of his life. If he could\nonly be summoned to action, he was capable of noble service. If his\nsympathies could only find an outlet, he was never so capable of love as\nnow; for his natural affections had been gathering in the course of all\nthese years, and the traces of that ineffaceable calamity of his\nlife were softened and partially hidden by new growths of thought and\nfeeling, as the wreck left by a mountainslide is covered over by the\ngentle intrusion of the soft-stemmed herbs which will prepare it for the\nstronger vegetation that will bring it once more into harmony with the\npeaceful slopes around it.\n\nPerhaps Dudley Veneer had not gained so much in worldly wisdom as if\nhe had been more in society and less in his study. The indulgence with\nwhich he treated his nephew was, no doubt, imprudent. A man more in the\nhabit of dealing with men would have been more guarded with a person\nwith Dick's questionable story and unquestionable physiognomy. But he\nwas singularly unsuspicious, and his natural kindness was an additional\nmotive to the wish for introducing some variety into the routine of\nElsie's life.\n\nIf Dudley Veneer did not know just what he wanted at this period of his\nlife, there were a great many people in the town of Rockland who thought\nthey did know. He had been a widower long enough, \u00e2\u0080\u009c--nigh twenty year,\nwa'n't it? He'd been aout to Spraowles's party,--there wa'n't anything\nto hender him why he shouldn't stir raound l'k other folks. What was the\nreason he did n't go abaout to taown-meetin's 'n' Sahbath-meetin's,\n'n' lyceums, 'n' school 'xaminations, 'n' s'prise-parties, 'n'\nfunerals,--and other entertainments where the still-faced two-story\nfolks were in the habit of looking round to see if any of the\nmansion-house gentry were present?--Fac' was, he was livin' too lonesome\ndaown there at the mansion-haouse. Why shouldn't he make up to the\nJedge's daughter? She was genteel enough for him, and--let's see, haow\nold was she? Seven-'n'itwenty,--no, six-'n'-twenty,--born the same year\nwe buried our little Anny Marl\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nThere was no possible objection to this arrangement, if the parties\ninterested had seen fit to make it or even to think of it. But \u00e2\u0080\u009cPortia,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n as some of the mansion-house people called her, did not happen to awaken\nthe elective affinities of the lonely widower. He met her once in a\nwhile, and said to himself that she was a good specimen of the grand\nstyle of woman; and then the image came back to him of a woman not quite\nso large, not quite so imperial in her port, not quite so incisive in\nher speech, not quite so judicial in her opinions, but with two or\nthree more joints in her frame, and two or three soft inflections in her\nvoice, which for some absurd reason or other drew him to her side and so\nbewitched him that he told her half his secrets and looked into her eyes\nall that he could not tell, in less time than it would have takes him\nto discuss the champion paper of the last Quarterly with the admirable\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPortia.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Heu, quanto minus! How much more was that lost image to him\nthan all it left on earth!\n\nThe study of love is very much like that of meteorology. We know that\njust about so much rain will fall in a season; but on what particular\nday it will shower is more than we can tell. We know that just about so\nmuch love will be made every year in a given population; but who will\nrain his young affections upon the heart of whom is not known except to\nthe astrologers and fortune-tellers. And why rain falls as it does and\nwhy love is made just as it is are equally puzzling questions.\n\nThe woman a man loves is always his own daughter, far more his daughter\nthan the female children born to him by the common law of life. It is\nnot the outside woman, who takes his name, that he loves: before her\nimage has reached the centre of his consciousness, it has passed through\nfifty many-layered nerve-strainers, been churned over by ten thousand\npulse-beats, and reacted upon by millions of lateral impulses which\nbandy it about through the mental spaces as a reflection is sent back\nand forward in a saloon lined with mirrors. With this altered image of\nthe woman before him, his preexisting ideal becomes blended. The object\nof his love is in part the offspring of her legal parents, but more of\nher lover's brain. The difference between the real and the ideal objects\nof love must not exceed a fixed maximum. The heart's vision cannot unite\nthem stereoscopically into a single image, if the divergence passes\ncertain limits. A formidable analogy, much in the nature of a proof,\nwith very serious consequences, which moralists and match-makers would\ndo well to remember! Double vision with the eyes of the heart is a\ndangerous physiological state, and may lead to missteps and serious\nfalls.\n\nWhether Dudley Veneer would ever find a breathing image near enough to\nhis ideal one, to fill the desolate chamber of his heart, or not, was\nvery doubtful. Some gracious and gentle woman, whose influence would\nsteal upon him as the first low words of prayer after that interval of\nsilent mental supplication known to one of our simpler forms of public\nworship, gliding into his consciousness without hurting its old griefs,\nherself knowing the chastening of sorrow, and subdued into sweet\nacquiescence with the Divine will,--some such woman as this, if Heaven\nshould send him such, might call him back to the world of happiness,\nfrom which he seemed forever exiled. He could never again be the young\nlover who walked through the garden-alleys all red with roses in the old\ndead and buried June of long ago. He could never forget the bride of his\nyouth, whose image, growing phantomlike with the lapse of years, hovered\nover him like a dream while waking and like a reality in dreams. But if\nit might be in God's good providence that this desolate life should come\nunder the influence of human affections once more, what an ecstasy of\nrenewed existence was in store for him! His life had not all been buried\nunder that narrow ridge of turf with the white stone at its head. It\nseemed so for a while; but it was not and could not and ought not to be\nso. His first passion had been a true and pure one; there was no spot or\nstain upon it. With all his grief there blended no cruel recollection\nof any word or look he would have wished to forget. All those little\ndifferences, such as young married people with any individual flavor in\ntheir characters must have, if they are tolerably mated, had only added\nto the music of existence, as the lesser discords admitted into some\nperfect symphony, fitly resolved, add richness and strength to the whole\nharmonious movement. It was a deep wound that Fate had inflicted on him;\nnay, it seemed like a mortal one; but the weapon was clean, and its edge\nwas smooth. Such wounds must heal with time in healthy natures, whatever\na false sentiment may say, by the wise and beneficent law of our\nbeing. The recollection of a deep and true affection is rather a divine\nnourishment for a life to grow strong upon than a poison to destroy it.\n\nDudley Venner's habitual sadness could not be laid wholly to his early\nbereavement. It was partly the result of the long struggle between\nnatural affection and duty, on one side, and the involuntary tendencies\nthese had to overcome, on the other,--between hope and fear, so long\nin conflict that despair itself would have been like an anodyne, and he\nwould have slept upon some final catastrophe with the heavy sleep of a\nbankrupt after his failure is proclaimed. Alas! some new affection might\nperhaps rekindle the fires of youth in his heart; but what power could\ncalm that haggard terror of the parent which rose with every morning's\nsun and watched with every evening star,--what power save alone that of\nhim who comes bearing the inverted torch, and leaving after him only the\nashes printed with his footsteps?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. THE WIDOW ROWENS GIVES A TEA-PARTY.\n\nThere was a good deal of interest felt, as has been said, in the lonely\ncondition of Dudley Venner in that fine mansion-house of his, and\nwith that strange daughter, who would never be married, as many people\nthought, in spite of all the stories. The feelings expressed by the good\nfolks who dated from the time when they \u00e2\u0080\u009cburied aour little Anny Mari',\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n and others of that homespun stripe, were founded in reason, after all.\nAnd so it was natural enough that they should be shared by various\nladies, who, having conjugated the verb to live as far as the\npreterpluperfect tense, were ready to change one of its vowels and begin\nwith it in the present indicative. Unfortunately, there was very little\nchance of showing sympathy in its active form for a gentleman who kept\nhimself so much out of the way as the master of the Dudley Mansion.\n\nVarious attempts had been made, from time to time, of late years, to get\nhim out of his study, which had, for the most part, proved failures. It\nwas a surprise, therefore, when he was seen at the Great Party at\nthe Colonel's. But it was an encouragement to try him again, and the\nconsequence had been that he had received a number of notes inviting him\nto various smaller entertainments, which, as neither he nor Elsie had\nany fancy for them, he had politely declined.\n\nSuch was the state of things when he received an invitation to take tea\nsociably, with a few friends, at Hyacinth Cottage, the residence of the\nWidow Rowens, relict of the late Beeri Rowens, Esquire, better known as\nMajor Rowens. Major Rowens was at the time of his decease a promising\nofficer in the militia, in the direct line of promotion, as his\nwaistband was getting tighter every year; and, as all the world knows,\nthe militia-officer who splits off most buttons and fills the largest\nsword-belt stands the best chance of rising, or, perhaps we might say,\nspreading, to be General.\n\nMajor Rowens united in his person certain other traits which help a man\nto eminence in the branch of public service referred to. He ran to high\ncolors, to wide whiskers, to open pores; he had the saddle-leather skin\ncommon in Englishmen, rarer in Americans,--never found in the Brahmin\ncaste, oftener in the military and the commodores: observing people know\nwhat is meant; blow the seed-arrows from the white-kid-looking button\nwhich holds them on a dandelion-stalk, and the pricked-pincushion\nsurface shows you what to look for. He had the loud gruff voice which\nimplies the right to command. He had the thick hand, stubbed fingers,\nwith bristled pads between their joints, square, broad thumb-nails, and\nsturdy limbs, which mark a constitution made to use in rough out-door\nwork. He had the never-failing predilection for showy switch-tailed\nhorses that step high, and sidle about, and act as if they were going to\ndo something fearful the next minute, in the face of awed and admiring\nmultitudes gathered at mighty musters or imposing cattle-shows. He had\nno objection, either, to holding the reins in a wagon behind another\nkind of horse,--a slouching, listless beast, with a strong slant to his\nshoulder; and a notable depth to his quarter and an emphatic angle at\nthe hock, who commonly walked or lounged along in a lazy trot of five\nor six miles an hour; but, if a lively colt happened to come rattling up\nalongside, or a brandy-faced old horse-jockey took the road to show off\na fast nag, and threw his dust into the Major's face, would pick his\nlegs up all at once, and straighten his body out, and swing off into a\nthree-minute gait, in a way that \u00e2\u0080\u009cOld Blue\u00e2\u0080\u009d himself need not have been\nashamed of.\n\nFor some reason which must be left to the next generation of professors\nto find out, the men who are knowing in horse-flesh have an eye also\nfor, let a long dash separate the brute creation from the angelic\nbeing now to be named,--for lovely woman. Of this fact there can be no\npossible doubt; and therefore you shall notice, that, if a fast\nhorse trots before two, one of the twain is apt to be a pretty bit of\nmuliebrity, with shapes to her, and eyes flying about in all directions.\n\nMajor Rowens, at that time Lieutenant of the Rockland Fusileers, had\ndriven and \u00e2\u0080\u009ctraded\u00e2\u0080\u009d horses not a few before he turned his acquired skill\nas a judge of physical advantages in another direction. He knew a neat,\nsnug hoof, a delicate pastern, a broad haunch, a deep chest, a close\nribbed-up barrel, as well as any other man in the town. He was not to be\ntaken in by your thick-jointed, heavy-headed cattle, without any go\nto them, that suit a country-parson, nor yet by the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgaanted-up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n long-legged animals, with all their constitutions bred out of them, such\nas rich greenhorns buy and cover up with their plated trappings.\n\nWhether his equine experience was of any use to him in the selection of\nthe mate with whom he was to go in double harness so long as they both\nshould live, we need not stop to question. At any rate, nobody could\nfind fault with the points of Miss Marilla Van Deusen, to whom he\noffered the privilege of becoming Mrs. Rowens. The Van must have been\ncrossed out of her blood, for she was an out-and-out brunette, with hair\nand eyes black enough for a Mohawk's daughter. A fine style of woman,\nwith very striking tints and outlines,--an excellent match for the\nLieutenant, except for one thing. She was marked by Nature for a widow.\nShe was evidently got up for mourning, and never looked so well as in\ndeep black, with jet ornaments.\n\nThe man who should dare to marry her would doom himself; for how could\nshe become the widow she was bound to be, unless he could retire and\ngive her a chance? The Lieutenant lived, however, as we have seen, to\nbecome Captain and then Major, with prospects of further advancement.\nBut Mrs. Rowens often said she should never look well in colors. At last\nher destiny fulfilled itself, and the justice of Nature was vindicated.\nMajor Rowens got overheated galloping about the field on the day of\nthe Great Muster, and had a rush of blood to the head, according to the\ncommon report,--at any rate, something which stopped him short in his\ncareer of expansion and promotion, and established Mrs. Rowens in her\nnormal condition of widowhood.\n\nThe Widow Rowens was now in the full bloom of ornamental sorrow. A very\nshallow crape bonnet, frilled and froth-like, allowed the parted raven\nhair to show its glossy smoothness. A jet pin heaved upon her bosom with\nevery sigh of memory, or emotion of unknown origin. Jet bracelets shone\nwith every movement of her slender hands, cased in close-fitting black\ngloves. Her sable dress was ridged with manifold flounces, from beneath\nwhich a small foot showed itself from time to time, clad in the same\nhue of mourning. Everything about her was dark, except the whites of her\neyes and the enamel of her teeth. The effect was complete. Gray's Elegy\nwas not a more perfect composition.\n\nMuch as the Widow was pleased with the costume belonging to her\ncondition, she did not disguise from herself that under certain\ncircumstances she might be willing to change her name again. Thus, for\ninstance, if a gentleman not too far gone in maturity, of dignified\nexterior, with an ample fortune, and of unexceptionable character,\nshould happen to set his heart upon her, and the only way to make him\nhappy was to give up her weeds and go into those unbecoming colors\nagain for his sake,--why, she felt that it was in her nature to make the\nsacrifice. By a singular coincidence it happened that a gentleman was\nnow living in Rockland who united in himself all these advantages. Who\nhe was, the sagacious reader may very probably have divined. Just to see\nhow it looked, one day, having bolted her door, and drawn the curtains\nclose, and glanced under the sofa, and listened at the keyhole to be\nsure there was nobody in the entry,--just to see how it looked, she had\ntaken out an envelope and written on the back of it Mrs. Manilla Veneer.\nIt made her head swim and her knees tremble. What if she should faint,\nor die, or have a stroke of palsy, and they should break into the room\nand find that name written! How she caught it up and tore it into little\nshreds, and then could not be easy until she had burned the small heap\nof pieces--\n\nBut these are things which every honorable reader will consider imparted\nin strict confidence.\n\nThe Widow Rowens, though not of the mansion house set, was among the\nmost genteel of the two-story circle, and was in the habit of visiting\nsome of the great people. In one of these visits she met a dashing young\nfellow with an olive complexion at the house of a professional gentleman\nwho had married one of the white necks and pairs of fat arms from a\ndistinguished family before referred to. The professional gentleman\nhimself was out, but the lady introduced the olive-complexioned young\nman as Mr. Richard Venner.\n\nThe Widow was particularly pleased with this accidental meeting. Had\nheard Mr. Venner's name frequently mentioned. Hoped his uncle was well,\nand his charming cousin,--was she as original as ever? Had often admired\nthat charming creature he rode: we had had some fine horses. Had never\ngot over her taste for riding, but could find nobody that liked a good\nlong gallop since--well--she could n't help wishing she was alongside of\nhim, the other day, when she saw him dashing by, just at twilight.\n\nThe Widow paused; lifted a flimsy handkerchief with a very deep black\nborder so as to play the jet bracelet; pushed the tip of her slender\nfoot beyond the lowest of her black flounces; looked up; looked down;\nlooked at Mr. Richard, the very picture of artless simplicity,--as\nrepresented in well-played genteel comedy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA good bit of stuff,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dick said to himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand something of it left\nyet; caramba!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Major had not studied points for nothing, and\nthe Widow was one of the right sort. The young man had been a little\nrestless of late, and was willing to vary his routine by picking up an\nacquaintance here and there. So he took the Widow's hint. He should like\nto have a scamper of half a dozen miles with her some fine morning.\n\nThe Widow was infinitely obliged; was not sure that she could find any\nhorse in the village to suit her; but it was so kind in him! Would he\nnot call at Hyacinth Cottage, and let her thank him again there?\n\nThus began an acquaintance which the Widow made the most of, and on the\nstrength of which she determined to give a tea-party and invite a number\nof persons of whom we know something already. She took a half-sheet of\nnote-paper and made out her list as carefully as a country \u00e2\u0080\u009cmerchant's\nclerk\u00e2\u0080\u009d adds up two and threepence (New-England nomenclature) and twelve\nand a half cents, figure by figure, and fraction by fraction, before\nhe can be sure they will make half a dollar, without cheating somebody.\nAfter much consideration the list reduced itself to the following names:\nMr. Richard Venner and Mrs. Blanche Creamer, the lady at whose house she\nhad met him,--mansion-house breed,--but will come,--soft on Dick; Dudley\nVenner,--take care of him herself; Elsie,--Dick will see to her,--won't\nit fidget the Creamer woman to see him round her? the old Doctor,--he\n's always handy; and there's that young master there, up at the\nschool,--know him well enough to ask him,--oh, yes, he'll come. One,\ntwo, three, four, five, six,--seven; not room enough, without the leaf\nin the table; one place empty, if the leaf's in. Let's see,--Helen\nDarley,--she 'll do well enough to fill it up,--why, yes, just the\nthing,--light brown hair, blue eyes,--won't my pattern show off well\nagainst her? Put her down,--she 's worth her tea and toast ten times\nover,--nobody knows what a \u00e2\u0080\u009cthunder-and-lightning woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as poor Major\nused to have it, is, till she gets alongside of one of those old-maidish\ngirls, with hair the color of brown sugar, and eyes like the blue of a\nteacup.\n\nThe Widow smiled with a feeling of triumph at having overcome her\ndifficulties and arranged her party,--arose and stood before her glass,\nthree-quarters front, one-quarter profile, so as to show the whites of\nthe eyes and the down of the upper lip. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSplendid!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Widow--and\nto tell the truth, she was not far out of the way, and with Helen Darley\nas a foil anybody would know she must be foudroyant and pyramidal,--if\nthese French adjectives may be naturalized for this one particular\nexigency.\n\nSo the Widow sent out her notes. The black grief which had filled her\nheart and had overflowed in surges of crape around her person had left a\ndeposit half an inch wide at the margin of her note-paper. Her seal was\na small youth with an inverted torch, the same on which Mrs. Blanche\nCreamer made her spiteful remark, that she expected to see that boy of\nthe Widow's standing on his head yet; meaning, as Dick supposed, that\nshe would get the torch right-side up as soon as she had a chance. That\nwas after Dick had made the Widow's acquaintance, and Mrs. Creamer had\ngot it into her foolish head that she would marry that young fellow,\nif she could catch him. How could he ever come to fancy such a\nquadroon-looking thing as that, she should like to know?\n\nIt is easy enough to ask seven people to a party; but whether they will\ncome or not is an open question, as it was in the case of the spirits of\nthe vasty deep. If the note issues from a three-story mansion-house, and\ngoes to two-story acquaintances, they will all be in an excellent\nstate of health, and have much pleasure in accepting this very polite\ninvitation. If the note is from the lady of a two-story family to\nthree-story ones, the former highly respectable person will very\nprobably find that an endemic complaint is prevalent, not represented in\nthe weekly bills of mortality, which occasions numerous regrets in the\nbosoms of eminently desirable parties that they cannot have the pleasure\nof and-so-forthing.\n\nIn this case there was room for doubt,--mainly as to whether Elsie\nwould take a fancy to come or not. If she should come, her father would\ncertainly be with her. Dick had promised, and thought he could bring\nElsie. Of course the young schoolmaster will come, and that poor\ntired-out looking Helen, if only to get out of sight of those horrid\nPeckham wretches. They don't get such invitations every day. The others\nshe felt sure of,--all but the old Doctor,--he might have some\nhorrid patient or other to visit; tell him Elsie Venner's going to be\nthere,--he always likes to have an eye on her, they say,--oh, he'd come\nfast enough, without any more coaxing.\n\nShe wanted the Doctor, particularly. It was odd, but she was afraid of\nElsie. She felt as if she should be safe enough, if the old Doctor were\nthere to see to the girl; and then she should have leisure to devote\nherself more freely to the young lady's father, for whom all her\nsympathies were in a state of lively excitement.\n\nIt was a long time since the Widow had seen so many persons round her\ntable as she had now invited. Better have the plates set and see how\nthey will fill it up with the leaf in.--A little too scattering with\nonly eight plates set: if she could find two more people, now, that\nwould bring the chairs a little closer,--snug, you know,--which makes\nthe company sociable. The Widow thought over her acquaintances. Why how\nstupid! there was her good minister, the same who had married her, and\nmight--might--bury her for aught she anew, and his granddaughter\nstaying with him,--nice little girl, pretty, and not old enough to be\ndangerous;--for the Widow had no notion of making a tea-party and asking\npeople to it that would be like to stand between her and any little\nproject she might happen to have on anybody's heart,--not she! It was\nall right now; Blanche was married and so forth; Letty was a child;\nElsie was his daughter; Helen Darley was a nice, worthy drudge,--poor\nthing!--faded, faded,--colors wouldn't wash, just what she wanted to\nshow off against. Now, if the Dudley mansion-house people would only\ncome,--that was the great point.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere's a note for us, Elsie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said her father, as they sat round the\nbreakfast-table. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMrs. Rowens wants us all to come to tea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was one of \u00e2\u0080\u009cElsie's days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as old Sophy called them. The light in her\neyes was still, but very bright. She looked up so full of perverse and\nwilful impulses, that Dick knew he could make her go with him and\nher father. He had his own motives for bringing her to this\ndetermination,--and his own way of setting about it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't want to go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you say, uncle?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo tell the truth, Richard, I don't mach fancy the Major's widow. I\ndon't like to see her weeds flowering out quite so strong. I suppose you\ndon't care about going, Elsie?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nElsie looked up in her father's face with an expression which he knew\nbut too well. She was just in the state which the plain sort of people\ncall \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontrary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d when they have to deal with it in animals. She would\ninsist on going to that tea-party; he knew it just as well before she\nspoke as after she had spoken. If Dick had said he wanted to go and her\nfather had seconded his wishes, she would have insisted on staying at\nhome. It was no great matter, her father said to himself, after\nall; very likely it would amuse her; the Widow was a lively woman\nenough,--perhaps a little comme il ne faut pas socially, compared with\nthe Thorntons and some other families; but what did he care for these\npetty village distinctions?\n\nElsie spoke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean to go. You must go with me, Dudley. You may do as you like,\nDick.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat settled the Dudley-mansion business, of course. They all three\naccepted, as fortunately did all the others who had been invited.\n\nHyacinth Cottage was a pretty place enough, a little too much choked\nround with bushes, and too much overrun with climbing-roses, which, in\nthe season of slugs and rose-bugs, were apt to show so brown about\nthe leaves and so coleopterous about the flowers, that it might be\nquestioned whether their buds and blossoms made up for these unpleasant\nanimal combinations,--especially as the smell of whale-oil soap was very\ncommonly in the ascendant over that of the roses. It had its patch\nof grass called \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe lawn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and its glazed closet known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe\nconservatory,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to that system of harmless fictions\ncharacteristic of the rural imagination and shown in the names applied\nto many familiar objects. The interior of the cottage was more tasteful\nand ambitious than that of the ordinary two-story dwellings. In place\nof the prevailing hair-cloth covered furniture, the visitor had the\nsatisfaction of seating himself upon a chair covered with some of the\nWidow's embroidery, or a sofa luxurious with soft caressing plush. The\nsporting tastes of the late Major showed in various prints on the\nwall: Herring's \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlenipotentiary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the \u00e2\u0080\u009cred bullock\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the '34 Derby;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCadland\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Colonel;\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cCrucifix;\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWest-Australian,\u00e2\u0080\u009d fastest of\nmodern racers; and among native celebrities, ugly, game old \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoston,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n with his straight neck and ragged hips; and gray \u00e2\u0080\u009cLady Suffolk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d queen,\nin her day, not of the turf but of the track, \u00e2\u0080\u009cextending\u00e2\u0080\u009d herself till\nshe measured a rod, more or less, skimming along within a yard of the\nground, her legs opening and shutting under her with a snap, like the\nfour blades of a compound jack-knife.\n\nThese pictures were much more refreshing than those dreary fancy\ndeath-bed scenes, common in two-story country-houses, in which\nWashington and other distinguished personages are represented as\nobligingly devoting their last moments to taking a prominent part in\na tableau, in which weeping relatives, attached servants, professional\nassistants, and celebrated personages who might by a stretch of\nimagination be supposed present, are grouped in the most approved style\nof arrangement about the chief actor's pillow.\n\nA single glazed bookcase held the family library, which was hidden from\nvulgar eyes by green silk curtains behind the glass. It would have been\ninstructive to get a look at it, as it always is to peep into one's\nneighbor's book-shelves. From other sources and opportunities a partial\nidea of it has been obtained. The Widow had inherited some books from\nher mother, who was something of a reader: Young's \u00e2\u0080\u009cNight-Thoughts;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Preceptor;\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Task, a Poem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d by William Cowper; Hervey's\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMeditations;\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlonzo and Melissa;\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuccaneers of America;\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nTriumphs of Temper;\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cLa Belle Assemblee;\u00e2\u0080\u009d Thomson's \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeasons;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and a\nfew others. The Major had brought in \u00e2\u0080\u009cTom Jones\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeregrine Pickle;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n various works by Mr. Pierce Egan; \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoxiana,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Racing Calendar;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\na \u00e2\u0080\u009cBook of Lively Songs and Jests.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Widow had added the Poems\nof Lord Byron and T. Moore; \u00e2\u0080\u009cEugene Aram;\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Tower of London,\u00e2\u0080\u009d by\nHarrison Ainsworth; some of Scott's Novels; \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Pickwick Papers;\u00e2\u0080\u009d a\nvolume of Plays, by W. Shakespeare; \u00e2\u0080\u009cProverbial Philosophy;\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cPilgrim's\nProgress;\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Whole Duty of Man\u00e2\u0080\u009d (a present when she was married);\nwith two celebrated religious works, one by William Law and the other\nby Philip Doddridge, which were sent her after her husband's death, and\nwhich she had tried to read, but found that they did not agree with her.\nOf course the bookcase held a few school manuals and compendiums, and\none of Mr. Webster's Dictionaries. But the gilt-edged Bible always lay\non the centre-table, next to the magazine with the fashion-plates and\nthe scrap-book with pictures from old annuals and illustrated papers.\n\nThe reader need not apprehend the recital, at full length, of such\nformidable preparations for the Widow's tea-party as were required in\nthe case of Colonel Sprowle's Social Entertainment. A tea-party, even in\nthe country, is a comparatively simple and economical piece of business.\nAs soon as the Widow found that all her company were coming, she set\nto work, with the aid of her \u00e2\u0080\u009csmart\u00e2\u0080\u009d maid-servant and a daughter of her\nown, who was beginning to stretch and spread at a fearful rate, but whom\nshe treated as a small child, to make the necessary preparations. The\nsilver had to be rubbed; also the grand plated urn,--her mother's before\nhers,--style of the Empire,--looking as if it might have been made to\nhold the Major's ashes. Then came the making and baking of cake and\ngingerbread, the smell whereof reached even as far as the sidewalk in\nfront of the cottage, so that small boys returning from school snuffed\nit in the breeze, and discoursed with each other on its suggestions;\nso that the Widow Leech, who happened to pass, remembered she had n't\ncalled on Marilly Raowens for a consid'ble spell, and turned in at the\ngate and rang three times with long intervals,--but all in vain, the\ninside Widow having \u00e2\u0080\u009cspotted\u00e2\u0080\u009d the outside one through the blinds, and\nwhispered to her aides-de-camp to let the old thing ring away till she\npulled the bell out by the roots, but not to stir to open the door.\n\nWidow Rowens was what they called a real smart, capable woman, not very\ngreat on books, perhaps, but knew what was what and who was who as well\nas another,--knew how to make the little cottage look pretty, how to set\nout a tea-table, and, what a good many women never can find out, knew\nher own style and \u00e2\u0080\u009cgot herself up tip-top,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as our young friend Master\nGeordie, Colonel Sprowle's heir-apparent, remarked to his friend from\none of the fresh-water colleges. Flowers were abundant now, and she\nhad dressed her rooms tastefully with them. The centre-table had two or\nthree gilt-edged books lying carelessly about on it, and some prints\nand a stereoscope with stereographs to match, chiefly groups of picnics,\nweddings, etc., in which the same somewhat fatigued looking ladies\nof fashion and brides received the attentions of the same\nunpleasant-looking young men, easily identified under their different\ndisguises, consisting of fashionable raiment such as gentlemen are\nsupposed to wear habitually. With these, however, were some pretty\nEnglish scenes,--pretty except for the old fellow with the hanging\nunder-lip who infests every one of that interesting series; and a statue\nor two, especially that famous one commonly called the Lahcoon, so as to\nrhyme with moon and spoon, and representing an old man with his two sons\nin the embraces of two monstrous serpents.\n\nThere is no denying that it was a very dashing achievement of the\nWidow's to bring together so considerable a number of desirable guests.\nShe felt proud of her feat; but as to the triumph of getting Dudley\nVenner to come out for a visit to Hyacinth Cottage, she was surprised\nand almost frightened at her own success. So much might depend on the\nimpressions of that evening!\n\nThe next thing was to be sure that everybody should be in the right\nplace at the tea-table, and this the Widow thought she could manage by a\nfew words to the older guests and a little shuffling about and shifting\nwhen they got to the table. To settle everything the Widow made out\na diagram, which the reader should have a chance of inspecting in an\nauthentic copy, if these pages were allowed under any circumstances to\nbe the vehicle of illustrations. If, however, he or she really wishes to\nsee the way the pieces stood as they were placed at the beginning of the\ngame, (the Widow's gambit,) he or she had better at once take a sheet\nof paper, draw an oval, and arrange the characters according to the\nfollowing schedule.\n\nAt the head of the table, the Hostess, Widow Marilla Rowens. Opposite\nher, at the other end, Rev. Dr. Honeywood. At the right of the Hostess,\nDudley Veneer, next him Helen Darley, next her Dr. Kittredge, next\nhim Mrs. Blanche Creamer, then the Reverend Doctor. At the left of\nthe Hostess, Bernard Langdon, next him Letty Forrester, next Letty Mr.\nRichard Veneer, next him Elsie, and so to the Reverend Doctor again.\n\nThe company came together a little before the early hour at which it was\ncustomary to take tea in Rockland. The Widow knew everybody, of course:\nwho was there in Rockland she did not know? But some of them had to\nbe introduced: Mr. Richard Veneer to Mr. Bernard, Mr. Bernard to Miss\nLetty, Dudley Veneer to Miss Helen Darley, and so on. The two young men\nlooked each other straight in the eyes, both full of youthful life,\nbut one of frank and fearless aspect, the other with a dangerous feline\nbeauty alien to the New England half of his blood.\n\nThe guests talked, turned over the prints, looked at the flowers, opened\nthe \u00e2\u0080\u009cProverbial Philosophy\u00e2\u0080\u009d with gilt edges, and the volume of Plays by\nW. Shakespeare, examined the horse-pictures on the walls, and so passed\naway the time until tea was announced, when they paired off for the room\nwhere it was in readiness. The Widow had managed it well; everything was\njust as she wanted it. Dudley Veneer was between herself and the poor\ntired-looking schoolmistress with her faded colors. Blanche Creamer, a\nlax, tumble-to-pieces, Greuze-ish looking blonde, whom the Widow\nhated because the men took to her, was purgatoried between the two old\nDoctors, and could see all the looks that passed between Dick Venner and\nhis cousin. The young schoolmaster could talk to Miss Letty: it was his\nbusiness to know how to talk to schoolgirls. Dick would amuse himself\nwith his cousin Elsie. The old Doctors only wanted to be well fed and\nthey would do well enough.\n\nIt would be very pleasant to describe the tea-table; but in reality, it\ndid not pretend to offer a plethoric banquet to the guests. The Widow\nhad not visited the mansion-houses for nothing, and she had learned\nthere that an overloaded tea-table may do well enough for farm-hands\nwhen they come in at evening from their work and sit down unwashed in\ntheir shirtsleeves, but that for decently bred people such an insult to\nthe memory of a dinner not yet half-assimilated is wholly inadmissible.\nEverything was delicate, and almost everything of fair complexion: white\nbread and biscuits, frosted and sponge cake, cream, honey, straw-colored\nbutter; only a shadow here and there, where the fire had crisped and\nbrowned the surfaces of a stack of dry toast, or where a preserve had\nbrought away some of the red sunshine of the last year's summer. The\nWidow shall have the credit of her well-ordered tea-table, also of her\nbountiful cream-pitchers; for it is well known that city-people find\ncream a very scarce luxury in a good many country-houses of more\npretensions than Hyacinth Cottage. There are no better maims for ladies\nwho give tea-parties than these:\n\nCream is thicker than water. Large heart never loved little cream pot.\n\nThere is a common feeling in genteel families that the third meal of\nthe day is not so essential a part of the daily bread as to require any\nespecial acknowledgment to the Providence which bestows it. Very devout\npeople, who would never sit down to a breakfast or a dinner without the\ngrace before meat which honors the Giver of it, feel as if they thanked\nHeaven enough for their tea and toast by partaking of them cheerfully\nwithout audible petition or ascription. But the Widow was not exactly\nmansion-house-bred, and so thought it necessary to give the Reverend\nDoctor a peculiar look which he understood at once as inviting his\nprofessional services. He, therefore, uttered a few simple words of\ngratitude, very quietly,--much to the satisfaction of some of the\nguests, who had expected one of those elaborate effusions, with rolling\nup of the eyes and rhetorical accents, so frequent with eloquent divines\nwhen they address their Maker in genteel company.\n\nEverybody began talking with the person sitting next at hand. Mr.\nBernard naturally enough turned his attention first to the Widow; but\nsomehow or other the right side of the Widow seemed to be more\nwide awake than the left side, next him, and he resigned her to\nthe courtesies of Mr. Dudley Venner, directing himself, not very\nunwillingly, to the young girl next him on the other side. Miss Letty\nForrester, the granddaughter of the Reverend Doctor, was city-bred, as\nanybody might see, and city-dressed, as any woman would know at sight; a\nman might only feel the general effect of clear, well-matched colors, of\nharmonious proportions, of the cut which makes everything cling like a\nbather's sleeve where a natural outline is to be kept, and ruffle itself\nup like the hackle of a pitted fighting-cock where art has a right to\nluxuriate in silken exuberance. How this citybred and city-dressed girl\ncame to be in Rockland Mr. Bernard did not know, but he knew at any rate\nthat she was his next neighbor and entitled to his courtesies. She was\nhandsome, too, when he came to look, very handsome when he came to\nlook again,--endowed with that city beauty which is like the beauty of\nwall-fruit, something finer in certain respects than can be reared off\nthe pavement.\n\nThe miserable routinists who keep repeating invidiously Cowper's\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod made the country and man made the town,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nas if the town were a place to kill out the race in, do not know what\nthey are talking about. Where could they raise such Saint-Michael pears,\nsuch Saint-Germains, such Brown-Beurres, as we had until within a few\nyears growing within the walls of our old city-gardens? Is the dark\nand damp cavern where a ragged beggar hides himself better than a\ntown-mansion which fronts the sunshine and backs on its own cool shadow,\nwith gas and water and all appliances to suit all needs? God made the\ncavern and man made the house! What then?\n\nThere is no doubt that the pavement keeps a deal of mischief from coming\nup out of the earth, and, with a dash off of it in summer, just to cool\nthe soles of the feet when it gets too hot, is the best place for many\nconstitutions, as some few practical people have already discovered. And\njust so these beauties that grow and ripen against the city-walls, these\nyoung fellows with cheeks like peaches and young girls with cheeks like\nnectarines, show that the most perfect forms of artificial life can do\nas much for the human product as garden-culture for strawberries and\nblackberries.\n\nIf Mr. Bernard had philosophized or prosed in this way, with so pretty,\nnay, so lovely a neighbor as Miss Letty Forrester waiting for him to\nspeak to her, he would have to be dropped from this narrative as a\nperson unworthy of his good-fortune, and not deserving the kind reader's\nfurther notice. On the contrary, he no sooner set his eyes fairly on her\nthan he said to himself that she was charming, and that he wished she\nwere one of his scholars at the Institute. So he began talking with her\nin an easy way; for he knew something of young girls by this time, and,\nof course, could adapt himself to a young lady who looked as if she\nmight be not more than fifteen or sixteen years old, and therefore\ncould hardly be a match in intellectual resources for the seventeen and\neighteen year-old first-class scholars of the Apollinean Institute.\nBut city-wall-fruit ripens early, and he soon found that this girl's\ntraining had so sharpened her wits and stored her memory, that he need\nnot be at the trouble to stoop painfully in order to come down to her\nlevel.\n\nThe beauty of good-breeding is that it adjusts itself to all relations\nwithout effort, true to itself always however the manners of those\naround it may change. Self-respect and respect for others,--the\nsensitive consciousness poises itself in these as the compass in the\nship's binnacle balances itself and maintains its true level within\nthe two concentric rings which suspend it on their pivots. This\nthorough-bred school-girl quite enchanted Mr. Bernard. He could not\nunderstand where she got her style, her way of dress, her enunciation,\nher easy manners. The minister was a most worthy gentleman, but this\nwas not the Rockland native-born manner; some new element had come in\nbetween the good, plain, worthy man and this young girl, fit to be a\nCrown Prince's partner where there were a thousand to choose from.\n\nHe looked across to Helen Darley, for he knew she would understand the\nglance of admiration with which he called her attention to the young\nbeauty at his side; and Helen knew what a young girl could be, as\ncompared with what too many a one is, as well as anybody.\n\nThis poor, dear Helen of ours! How admirable the contrast between her\nand the Widow on the other side of Dudley Venner! But, what was very\nodd, that gentleman apparently thought the contrast was to the advantage\nof this poor, dear Helen. At any rate, instead of devoting himself\nsolely to the Widow, he happened to be just at that moment talking in a\nvery interested and, apparently, not uninteresting way to his right-hand\nneighbor, who, on her part, never looked more charmingly,--as Mr.\nBernard could not help saying to himself,--but, to be sure, he had just\nbeen looking at the young girl next him, so that his eyes were brimful\nof beauty, and may have spilled some of it on the first comer: for\nyou know M. Becquerel has been showing us lately how everything\nis phosphorescent; that it soaks itself with light in an instant's\nexposure, so that it is wet with liquid sunbeams, or, if you will,\ntremulous with luminous vibrations, when first plunged into the negative\nbath of darkness, and betrays itself by the light which escapes from its\nsurface.\n\nWhatever were the reason, this poor, dear Helen never looked so sweetly.\nHer plainly parted brown hair, her meek, blue eyes, her cheek just a\nlittle tinged with color, the almost sad simplicity of her dress, and\nthat look he knew so well,--so full of cheerful patience, so sincere,\nthat he had trusted her from the first moment as the believers of the\nlarger half of Christendom trust the Blessed Virgin,--Mr. Bernard took\nthis all in at a glance, and felt as pleased as if it had been his own\nsister Dorothea Elizabeth that he was looking at. As for Dudley Veneer,\nMr. Bernard could not help being struck by the animated expression of\nhis countenance. It certainly showed great kindness, on his part, to\npay so much attention to this quiet girl, when he had the\nthunder-and-lightning Widow on the other side of him.\n\nMrs. Marilla Rowens did not know what to make of it. She had made her\ntea-party expressly for Mr. Dudley Veneer. She had placed him just as\nshe wanted, between herself and a meek, delicate woman who dressed in\ngray, wore a plain breastpin with hair in it, who taught a pack of\ngirls up there at the school, and looked as if she were born for a\nteacher,--the very best foil that she could have chosen; and here was\nthis man, polite enough to herself, to be sure, but turning round to\nthat very undistinguished young person as if he rather preferred her\nconversation of the two!\n\nThe truth was that Dudley Veneer and Helen Darley met as two travellers\nmight meet in the desert, wearied, both of them, with their long\njourney, one having food, but no water, the other water, but no food.\nEach saw that the other had been in long conflict with some trial; for\ntheir voices were low and tender, as patiently borne sorrow and humbly\nuttered prayers make every human voice. Through these tones, more than\nby what they said, they came into natural sympathetic relations with\neach other. Nothing could be more unstudied. As for Dudley Venner, no\nbeauty in all the world could have so soothed and magnetized him as the\nvery repose and subdued gentleness which the Widow had thought would\nmake the best possible background for her own more salient and effective\nattractions. No doubt, Helen, on her side, was almost too readily\npleased with the confidence this new acquaintance she was making seemed\nto show her from the very first. She knew so few men of any condition!\nMr. Silas Peckham: he was her employer, and she ought to think of him\nas well as she could; but every time she thought of him it was with\na shiver of disgust. Mr. Bernard Langdon: a noble young man, a true\nfriend, like a brother to her,--God bless him, and send him some young\nheart as fresh as his own! But this gentleman produced a new impression\nupon her, quite different from any to which she was accustomed. His\nrich, low tones had the strangest significance to her; she felt sure\nhe must have lived through long experiences, sorrowful like her own.\nElsie's father! She looked into his dark eyes, as she listened to him,\nto see if they had any glimmer of that peculiar light, diamond-bright,\nbut cold and still, which she knew so well in Elsie's. Anything but\nthat! Never was there more tenderness, it seemed to her, than in the\nwhole look and expression of Elsie's father. She must have been a great\ntrial to him; yet his face was that of one who had been saddened, not\nsoured, by his discipline. Knowing what Elsie must be to him, how hard\nshe must make any parent's life, Helen could not but be struck with the\ninterest Mr. Dudley Venner showed in her as his daughter's instructress.\nHe was too kind to her; again and again she meekly turned from him, so\nas to leave him free to talk to the showy lady at his other side, who\nwas looking all the while\n\n                         \u00e2\u0080\u009clike the night\n          Of cloudless realms and starry skies;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nbut still Mr. Dudley Venner, after a few courteous words, came back to\nthe blue eyes and brown hair; still he kept his look fixed upon her, and\nhis tones grew sweeter and lower as he became more interested in talk,\nuntil this poor, dear Helen, what with surprise, and the bashfulness\nnatural to one who had seen little of the gay world, and the stirring of\ndeep, confused sympathies with this suffering father, whose heart seemed\nso full of kindness, felt her cheeks glowing with unwonted flame, and\nbetrayed the pleasing trouble of her situation by looking so sweetly as\nto arrest Mr. Bernard's eye for a moment, when he looked away from the\nyoung beauty sitting next him.\n\nElsie meantime had been silent, with that singular, still, watchful\nlook which those who knew her well had learned to fear. Her head just a\nlittle inclined on one side, perfectly motionless for whole minutes, her\neyes seeming to, grow small and bright, as always when she was under her\nevil influence, she was looking obliquely at the young girl on the\nother side of her cousin Dick and next to Bernard Langdon. As for Dick\nhimself, she seemed to be paying very little attention to him. Sometimes\nher eyes would wander off to Mr. Bernard, and their expression, as old\nDr. Kittredge, who watched her for a while pretty keenly, noticed, would\nchange perceptibly. One would have said that she looked with a kind of\ndull hatred at the girl, but with a half-relenting reproachful anger at\nMr. Bernard.\n\nMiss Letty Forrester, at whom Elsie had been looking from time to time\nin this fixed way, was conscious meanwhile of some unusual influence.\nFirst it was a feeling of constraint,--then, as it were, a diminished\npower over the muscles, as if an invisible elastic cobweb were spinning\nround her,--then a tendency to turn away from Mr. Bernard, who was\nmaking himself very agreeable, and look straight into those eyes which\nwould not leave her, and which seemed to be drawing her towards them,\nwhile at the same time they chilled the blood in all her veins.\n\nMr. Bernard saw this influence coming over her. All at once he noticed\nthat she sighed, and that some little points of moisture began to\nglisten on her forehead. But she did not grow pale perceptibly; she\nhad no involuntary or hysteric movements; she still listened to him and\nsmiled naturally enough. Perhaps she was only nervous at being stared\nat. At any rate, she was coming under some unpleasant influence or\nother, and Mr. Bernard had seen enough of the strange impression Elsie\nsometimes produced to wish this young girl to be relieved from it,\nwhatever it was. He turned toward Elsie and looked at her in such a way\nas to draw her eyes upon him. Then he looked steadily and calmly into\nthem. It was a great effort, for some perfectly inexplicable reason.\nAt one instant he thought he could not sit where he was; he must go and\nspeak to Elsie. Then he wanted to take his eyes away from hers; there\nwas something intolerable in the light that came from them. But he was\ndetermined to look her down, and he believed he could do it, for he had\nseen her countenance change more than once when he had caught her gaze\nsteadily fixed on him. All this took not minutes, but seconds. Presently\nshe changed color slightly,--lifted her head, which was inclined a\nlittle to one side,--shut and opened her eyes two or three times, as if\nthey had been pained or wearied,--and turned away baffled, and shamed,\nas it would seem, and shorn for the time of her singular and formidable\nor at least evil-natured power of swaying the impulses of those around\nher.\n\nIt takes too long to describe these scenes where a good deal of life\nis concentrated into a few silent seconds. Mr. Richard Veneer had sat\nquietly through it all, although this short pantomime had taken place\nliterally before his face. He saw what was going on well enough, and\nunderstood it all perfectly well. Of course the schoolmaster had been\ntrying to make Elsie jealous, and had succeeded. The little schoolgirl\nwas a decoy-duck,--that was all. Estates like the Dudley property were\nnot to be had every day, and no doubt the Yankee usher was willing to\ntake some pains to make sure of Elsie. Does n't Elsie look savage? Dick\ninvoluntarily moved his chair a little away from her, and thought he\nfelt a pricking in the small white scars on his wrist. A dare-devil\nfellow, but somehow or other this girl had taken strange hold of his\nimagination, and he often swore to himself, that, when he married her,\nhe would carry a loaded revolver with him to his bridal chamber.\n\nMrs. Blanche Creamer raged inwardly at first to find herself between\nthe two old gentlemen of the party. It very soon gave her great\ncomfort, however, to see that Marilla, Rowens had just missed it in her\ncalculations, and she chuckled immensely to find Dudley Veneer devoting\nhimself chiefly to Helen Darley. If the Rowens woman should hook Dudley,\nshe felt as if she should gnaw all her nails off for spite. To think of\nseeing her barouching about Rockland behind a pair of long-tailed bays\nand a coachman with a band on his hat, while she, Blanche Creamer, was\ndriving herself about in a one-horse \u00e2\u0080\u009ccarriage\u00e2\u0080\u009d! Recovering her spirits\nby degrees, she began playing her surfaces off at the two old Doctors,\njust by way of practice. First she heaved up a glaring white shoulder,\nthe right one, so that the Reverend Doctor should be stunned by it, if\nsuch a thing might be. The Reverend Doctor was human, as the Apostle was\nnot ashamed to confess himself. Half-devoutly and half-mischievously he\nrepeated inwardly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cResist the Devil and he will flee from you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As the\nReverend Doctor did not show any lively susceptibility, she thought\nshe would try the left shoulder on old Dr. Kittredge. That worthy\nand experienced student of science was not at all displeased with the\nmanoeuvre, and lifted his head so as to command the exhibition through\nhis glasses. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlanche is good for half a dozen years or so, if she is\ncareful,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor said to himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand then she must take to her\nprayer-book.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After this spasmodic failure of Mrs. Blanche Creamer's\nto stir up the old Doctors, she returned again to the pleasing task of\nwatching the Widow in her evident discomfiture. But dark as the Widow\nlooked in her half-concealed pet, she was but as a pale shadow, compared\nto Elsie in her silent concentration of shame and anger.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, there is one good thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Blanche Creamer; \u00e2\u0080\u009cDick\ndoesn't get much out of that cousin of his this evening! Does n't he\nlook handsome, though?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo Mrs. Blanche, being now a good deal taken up with her observations of\nthose friends of hers and ours, began to be rather careless of her two\nold Doctors, who naturally enough fell into conversation with each other\nacross the white surfaces of that lady, perhaps not very politely, but,\nunder the circumstances, almost as a matter of necessity.\n\nWhen a minister and a doctor get talking together, they always have a\ngreat deal to say; and so it happened that the company left the table\njust as the two Doctors were beginning to get at each other's ideas\nabout various interesting matters. If we follow them into the other\nparlor, we can, perhaps, pick up something of their conversation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. WHY DOCTORS DIFFER.\n\nThe company rearranged itself with some changes after leaving the\ntea-table. Dudley Veneer was very polite to the Widow; but that lady\nhaving been called off for a few moments for some domestic arrangement,\nhe slid back to the side of Helen Darley, his daughter's faithful\nteacher. Elsie had got away by herself, and was taken up in studying the\nstereoscopic Laocoon. Dick, being thus set free, had been seized upon by\nMrs. Blanche Creamer, who had diffused herself over three-quarters of\na sofa and beckoned him to the remaining fourth. Mr. Bernard and Miss\nLetty were having a snug fete-'a-fete in the recess of a bay-window. The\ntwo Doctors had taken two arm-chairs and sat squared off against each\nother. Their conversation is perhaps as well worth reporting as that of\nthe rest of the company, and, as it was carried on in a louder tone, was\nof course more easy to gather and put on record.\n\nIt was a curious sight enough to see those two representatives of two\ngreat professions brought face to face to talk over the subjects they\nhad been looking at all their lives from such different points of\nview. Both were old; old enough to have been moulded by their habits of\nthought and life; old enough to have all their beliefs \u00e2\u0080\u009cfretted in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as\nvintners say,--thoroughly worked up with their characters. Each of them\nlooked his calling. The Reverend Doctor had lived a good deal among\nbooks in his study; the Doctor, as we will call the medical gentleman,\nhad been riding about the country for between thirty and forty years.\nHis face looked tough and weather-worn; while the Reverend Doctor's,\nhearty as it appeared, was of finer texture. The Doctor's was the graver\nof the two; there was something of grimness about it, partly owing\nto the northeasters he had faced for so many years, partly to long\ncompanionship with that stern personage who never deals in sentiment or\npleasantry. His speech was apt to be brief and peremptory; it was a way\nhe had got by ordering patients; but he could discourse somewhat, on\noccasion, as the reader may find out. The Reverend Doctor had an open,\nsmiling expression, a cheery voice, a hearty laugh, and a cordial\nway with him which some thought too lively for his cloth, but which\nchildren, who are good judges of such matters, delighted in, so that\nhe was the favorite of all the little rogues about town. But he had the\nclerical art of sobering down in a moment, when asked to say grace while\nsomebody was in the middle of some particularly funny story; and though\nhis voice was so cheery in common talk, in the pulpit, like almost\nall preachers, he had a wholly different and peculiar way of speaking,\nsupposed to be more acceptable to the Creator than the natural manner.\nIn point of fact, most of our anti-papal and anti-prelatical clergymen\ndo really intone their prayers, without suspecting in the least that\nthey have fallen into such a Romish practice.\n\nThis is the way the conversation between the Doctor of Divinity and the\nDoctor of Medicine was going on at the point where these notes take it\nup.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cObi tres medici, duo athei, you know, Doctor. Your profession has\nalways had the credit of being lax in doctrine,--though pretty stringent\nin practice, ha! ha!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSome priest said that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor answered, dryly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey always talked\nLatin when they had a bigger lie than common to get rid of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Reverend Doctor; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm afraid they would lie a little\nsometimes. But isn't there some truth in it, Doctor? Don't you think\nyour profession is apt to see 'Nature' in the place of the God of\nNature,--to lose sight of the great First Cause in their daily study of\nsecondary causes?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI've thought about that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I've talked about\nit and read about it, and I've come to the conclusion that nobody\nbelieves in God and trusts in God quite so much as the doctors; only it\nis n't just the sort of Deity that some of your profession have wanted\nthem to take up with. There was a student of mine wrote a dissertation\non the Natural Theology of Health and Disease, and took that old lying\nproverb for his motto. He knew a good deal more about books than ever\nI did, and had studied in other countries. I'll tell you what he said\nabout it. He said the old Heathen Doctor, Galen, praised God for his\nhandiwork in the human body, just as if he had been a Christian, or the\nPsalmist himself. He said they had this sentence set up in large letters\nin the great lecture-room in Paris where he attended: I dressed his\nwound and God healed him. That was an old surgeon's saying. And he gave\na long list of doctors who were not only Christians, but famous ones. I\ngrant you, though, ministers and doctors are very apt to see differently\nin spiritual matters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat's it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Reverend Doctor; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are apt to see 'Nature'\nwhere we see God, and appeal to 'Science' where we are contented with\nRevelation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don't separate God and Nature, perhaps, as you do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor\nanswered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we say that God is omnipresent and omnipotent and\nomniscient, we are a little more apt to mean it than your folks are. We\nthink, when a wound heals, that God's presence and power and knowledge\nare there, healing it, just as that old surgeon did. We think a good\nmany theologians, working among their books, don't see the facts of the\nworld they live in. When we tell 'em of these facts, they are apt to\ncall us materialists and atheists and infidels, and all that. We can't\nhelp seeing the facts, and we don't think it's wicked to mention 'em.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo tell me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Reverend Doctor said, \u00e2\u0080\u009csome of these facts we are in\nthe habit of overlooking, and which your profession thinks it can see\nand understand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat's very easy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor instance: you don't\nunderstand or don't allow for idiosyncrasies as we learn to. We know\nthat food and physic act differently with different people; but you\nthink the same kind of truth is going to suit, or ought to suit, all\nminds. We don't fight with a patient because he can't take magnesia or\nopium; but you are all the time quarrelling over your beliefs, as if\nbelief did not depend very much on race and constitution, to say nothing\nof early training.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you mean to say that every man is not absolutely free to choose his\nbeliefs?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe men you write about in your studies are, but not the men we see\nin the real world. There is some apparently congenital defect in the\nIndians, for instance, that keeps them from choosing civilization and\nChristianity. So with the Gypsies, very likely. Everybody knows\nthat Catholicism or Protestantism is a good deal a matter of race.\nConstitution has more to do with belief than people think for. I went to\na Universalist church, when I was in the city one day, to hear a famous\nman whom all the world knows, and I never saw such pews-full of broad\nshoulders and florid faces, and substantial, wholesome-looking persons,\nmale and female, in all my life. Why, it was astonishing. Either their\ncreed made them healthy, or they chose it because they were healthy.\nYour folks have never got the hang of human nature.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am afraid this would be considered a degrading and dangerous view of\nhuman beliefs and responsibility for them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Reverend Doctor replied.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cProve to a man that his will is governed by something outside of\nhimself, and you have lost all hold on his moral and religious nature.\nThere is nothing bad men want to believe so much as that they are\ngoverned by necessity. Now that which is at once degrading and dangerous\ncannot be true.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo doubt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009call large views of mankind limit our\nestimate of the absolute freedom of the will. But I don't think it\ndegrades or endangers us, for this reason, that, while it makes us\ncharitable to the rest of mankind, our own sense of freedom, whatever it\nis, is never affected by argument. Conscience won't be reasoned with.\nWe feel that we can practically do this of that, and if we choose the\nwrong, we know we are responsible; but observation teaches us that this\nor that other race or individual has not the same practical freedom of\nchoice. I don't see how we can avoid this conclusion in the instance\nof the American Indians. The science of Ethnology has upset a good many\ntheoretical notions about human nature.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cScience!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Reverend Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cscience! that was a word the\nApostle Paul did not seem to think much of, if we may judge by the\nEpistle to Timothy: 'Oppositions of science falsely so called.' I own\nthat I am jealous of that word and the pretensions that go with\nit. Science has seemed to me to be very often only the handmaid of\nskepticism.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoctor!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the physician said, emphatically, \u00e2\u0080\u009cscience is knowledge.\nNothing that is not known properly belongs to science. Whenever\nknowledge obliges us to doubt, we are always safe in doubting.\nAstronomers foretell eclipses, say how long comets are to stay with us,\npoint out where a new planet is to be found. We see they know what they\nassert, and the poor old Roman Catholic Church has at last to knock\nunder. So Geology proves a certain succession of events, and the best\nChristian in the world must make the earth's history square with it.\nBesides, I don't think you remember what great revelations of himself\nthe Creator has made in the minds of the men who have built up science.\nYou seem to me to hold his human masterpieces very cheap. Don't\nyou think the 'inspiration of the Almighty' gave Newton and Cuvier\n'understanding'?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Reverend Doctor was not arguing for victory. In fact, what he\nwanted was to call out the opinions of the old physician by a show of\nopposition, being already predisposed to agree with many of them. He was\nrather trying the common arguments, as one tries tricks of fence merely\nto learn the way of parrying. But just here he saw a tempting opening,\nand could not resist giving a home-thrust.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes; but you surely would not consider it inspiration of the same kind\nas that of the writers of the Old Testament?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat cornered the Doctor, and he paused a moment before he replied. Then\nhe raised his head, so as to command the Reverend Doctor's face through\nhis spectacles, and said,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did not say that. You are clear, I suppose, that the Omniscient spoke\nthrough Solomon, but that Shakespeare wrote without his help?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Reverend Doctor looked very grave. It was a bold, blunt way\nof putting the question. He turned it aside with the remark, that\nShakespeare seemed to him at times to come as near inspiration as any\nhuman being not included among the sacred writers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the physician began, as from a sudden suggestion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou won't\nquarrel with me, if I tell you some of my real thoughts, will you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSay on, my dear Sir, say on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the minister answered, with his most\ngenial smile; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour real thoughts are just what I want to get at. A\nman's real thoughts are a great rarity. If I don't agree with you, I\nshall like to hear you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor began; and in order to give his thoughts more connectedly, we\nwill omit the conversational breaks, the questions and comments of the\nclergyman, and all accidental interruptions.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen the old ecclesiastics said that where there were three doctors\nthere were two atheists, they lied, of course. They called everybody who\ndiffered from them atheists, until they found out that not believing in\nGod was n't nearly so ugly a crime as not believing in some particular\ndogma; then they called them heretics, until so many good people\nhad been burned under that name that it began to smell too strong of\nroasting flesh,--and after that infidels, which properly means people\nwithout faith, of whom there are not a great many in any place or time.\nBut then, of course, there was some reason why doctors shouldn't think\nabout religion exactly as ministers did, or they never would have made\nthat proverb. It 's very likely that something of the same kind is true\nnow; whether it is so or not, I am going to tell you the reasons why it\nwould not be strange, if doctors should take rather different views from\nclergymen about some matters of belief. I don't, of course, mean all\ndoctors nor all clergymen. Some doctors go as far as any old New England\ndivine, and some clergymen agree very well with the doctors that think\nleast according to rule.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo begin with their ideas of the Creator himself. They always see him\ntrying to help his creatures out of their troubles. A man no sooner gets\na cut, than the Great Physician, whose agency we often call Nature, goes\nto work, first to stop the blood, and then to heal the wound, and then\nto make the scar as small as possible. If a man's pain exceeds a certain\namount, he faints, and so gets relief. If it lasts too long, habit comes\nin to make it tolerable. If it is altogether too bad, he dies. That\nis the best thing to be done under the circumstances. So you see, the\ndoctor is constantly in presence of a benevolent agency working against\na settled order of things, of which pain and disease are the accidents,\nso to speak. Well, no doubt they find it harder than clergymen to\nbelieve that there can be any world or state from which this benevolent\nagency is wholly excluded. This may be very wrong; but it is not\nunnatural.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey can hardly conceive of a permanent state of being in which cuts\nwould never try to heal, nor habit render suffering endurable. This is\none effect of their training.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen, again, their attention is very much called to human limitations.\nMinisters work out the machinery of responsibility in an abstract kind\nof way; they have a sort of algebra of human nature, in which friction\nand strength (or weakness) of material are left out. You see, a doctor\nis in the way of studying children from the moment of birth upwards. For\nthe first year or so he sees that they are just as much pupils of their\nMaker as the young of any other animals. Well, their Maker trains them\nto pure selfishness. Why? In order that they may be sure to take care of\nthemselves. So you see, when a child comes to be, we will say a year and\na day old, and makes his first choice between right and wrong, he is\nat a disadvantage; for he, has that vis a tergo, as we doctors call it,\nthat force from behind, of a whole year's life of selfishness, for which\nhe is no more to blame than a calf is to blame for having lived in the\nsame way, purely to gratify his natural appetites. Then we see that baby\ngrow up to a child, and, if he is fat and stout and red and lively,\nwe expect to find him troublesome and noisy, and, perhaps, sometimes\ndisobedient more or less; that's the way each new generation breaks its\negg-shell; but if he is very weak and thin, and is one of the kind that\nmay be expected to die early, he will very likely sit in the house all\nday and read good books about other little sharp-faced children just\nlike himself, who died early, having always been perfectly indifferent\nto all the out-door amusements of the wicked little red-cheeked\nchildren.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSome of the little folks we watch grow up to be young women, and\noccasionally one of them gets nervous, what we call hysterical, and then\nthat girl will begin to play all sorts of pranks,--to lie and cheat,\nperhaps, in the most unaccountable way, so that she might seem to a\nminister a good example of total depravity. We don't see her in that\nlight. We give her iron and valerian, and get her on horseback, if we\ncan, and so expect to make her will come all right again. By and by we\nare called in to see an old baby, threescore years and ten or more old.\nWe find this old baby has never got rid of that first year's teaching\nwhich led him to fill his stomach with all he could pump into it, and\nhis hands with everything he could grab. People call him a miser. We are\nsorry for him; but we can't help remembering his first year's training,\nand the natural effect of money on the great majority of those that have\nit. So while the ministers say he 'shall hardly enter into the kingdom\nof heaven,' we like to remind them that 'with God all things are\npossible.'\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce more, we see all kinds of monomania and insanity. We learn from\nthem to recognize all sorts of queer tendencies in minds supposed to\nbe sane, so that we have nothing but compassion for a large class of\npersons condemned as sinners by theologians, but considered by us as\ninvalids. We have constant reasons for noticing the transmission of\nqualities from parents to offspring, and we find it hard to hold a\nchild accountable in any moral point of view for inherited bad temper\nor tendency to drunkenness,--as hard as we should to blame him for\ninheriting gout or asthma. I suppose we are more lenient with human\nnature than theologians generally are. We know that the spirits of men\nand their views of the present and the future go up and down with the\nbarometer, and that a permanent depression of one inch in the mercurial\ncolumn would affect the whole theology of Christendom.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMinisters talk about the human will as if it stood on a high look-out,\nwith plenty of light, and elbowroom reaching to the horizon. Doctors\nare constantly noticing how it is tied up and darkened by inferior\norganization, by disease, and all sorts of crowding interferences, until\nthey get to look upon Hottentots and Indians--and a good many of their\nown race as a kind of self-conscious blood-clocks with very limited\npower of self-determination. That's the tendency, I say, of a doctor's\nexperience. But the people to whom they address their statements of the\nresults of their observation belong to the thinking class of the highest\nraces, and they are conscious of a great deal of liberty of will. So in\nthe face of the fact that civilization with all it offers has proved a\ndead failure with the aboriginal races of this country,--on the whole, I\nsay, a dead failure,--they talk as if they knew from their own will all\nabout that of a Digger Indian! We are more apt to go by observation of\nthe facts in the case. We are constantly seeing weakness where you see\ndepravity. I don't say we're right; I only tell what you must often find\nto be the fact, right or wrong, in talking with doctors. You see, too,\nour notions of bodily and moral disease, or sin, are apt to go together.\nWe used to be as hard on sickness as you were on sin. We know better\nnow. We don't look at sickness as we used to, and try to poison it\nwith everything that is offensive, burnt toads and earth-worms and\nviper-broth, and worse things than these. We know that disease has\nsomething back of it which the body isn't to blame for, at least in most\ncases, and which very often it is trying to get rid of. Just so with\nsin. I will agree to take a hundred new-born babes of a certain stock\nand return seventy-five of them in a dozen years true and honest, if not\n'pious' children. And I will take another hundred, of a different stock,\nand put them in the hands of certain Ann-Street or Five-Points teachers,\nand seventy-five of them will be thieves and liars at the end of the\nsame dozen years. I have heard of an old character, Colonel Jaques, I\nbelieve it was, a famous cattle-breeder, who used to say he could breed\nto pretty much any pattern he wanted to. Well, we doctors see so much of\nfamilies, how the tricks of the blood keep breaking out, just as much in\ncharacter as they do in looks, that we can't help feeling as if a great\nmany people hadn't a fair chance to be what is called 'good,' and that\nthere isn't a text in the Bible better worth keeping always in mind than\nthat one, 'Judge not, that ye be not judged.'\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs for our getting any quarter at the hands of theologians, we don't\nexpect it, and have no right to. You don't give each other any quarter.\nI have had two religious books sent me by friends within a week or\ntwo. One is Mr. Brownson's; he is as fair and square as Euclid; a\nreal honest, strong thinker, and one that knows what he is talking\nabout,--for he has tried all sorts of religions, pretty much. He tells\nus that the Roman Catholic Church is the one 'through which alone we can\nhope for heaven.' The other is by a worthy Episcopal rector, who appears\nto write as if he were in earnest, and he calls the Papacy the 'Devil's\nMasterpiece,' and talks about the 'Satanic scheme' of that very Church\n'through which alone,' as Mr. Brownson tells us, 'we can hope for\nheaven.'\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat's the use in our caring about hard words after this,--'atheists,'\nheretics, infidels, and the like? They're, after all, only the cinders\npicked up out of those heaps of ashes round the stumps of the old stakes\nwhere they used to burn men, women, and children for not thinking just\nlike other folks. They 'll 'crock' your fingers, but they can't burn us.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoctors are the best-natured people in the world, except when they get\nfighting with each other. And they have some advantages over you. You\ninherit your notions from a set of priests that had no wives and no\nchildren, or none to speak of, and so let their humanity die out of\nthem. It did n't seem much to them to condemn a few thousand millions of\npeople to purgatory or worse for a mistake of judgment. They didn't know\nwhat it was to have a child look up in their faces and say 'Father!'\nIt will take you a hundred or two more years to get decently humanized,\nafter so many centuries of de-humanizing celibacy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBesides, though our libraries are, perhaps, not commonly quite so big\nas yours, God opens one book to physicians that a good many of you don't\nknow much about,--the Book of Life. That is none of your dusty folios\nwith black letters between pasteboard and leather, but it is printed\nin bright red type, and the binding of it is warm and tender to every\ntouch. They reverence that book as one of the Almighty's infallible\nrevelations. They will insist on reading you lessons out of it, whether\nyou call them names or not. These will always be lessons of charity. No\ndoubt, nothing can be more provoking to listen to. But do beg your folks\nto remember that the Smithfield fires are all out, and that the cinders\nare very dirty and not in the least dangerous. They'd a great deal\nbetter be civil, and not be throwing old proverbs in the doctors' faces,\nwhen they say that the man of the old monkish notions is one thing\nand the man they watch from his cradle to his coffin is something very\ndifferent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt has cost a good deal of trouble to work the Doctor's talk up into\nthis formal shape. Some of his sentences have been rounded off for him,\nand the whole brought into a more rhetorical form than it could have\npretended to, if taken as it fell from his lips. But the exact course\nof his remarks has been followed, and as far as possible his expressions\nhave been retained. Though given in the form of a discourse, it must\nbe remembered that this was a conversation, much more fragmentary and\ncolloquial than it seems as just read.\n\nThe Reverend Doctor was very far from taking offence at the old\nphysician's freedom of speech. He knew him to be honest, kind,\ncharitable, self-denying, wherever any sorrow was to be alleviated,\nalways reverential, with a cheerful trust in the great Father of all\nmankind. To be sure, his senior deacon, old Deacon Shearer,--who seemed\nto have got his Scripture-teachings out of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cVinegar Bible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (the one\nwhere Vineyard is misprinted Vinegar; which a good many people seem to\nhave adopted as the true reading,)--his senior deacon had called Dr.\nKittredge an \u00e2\u0080\u009cinfidel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the Reverend Doctor could not help feeling,\nthat, unless the text, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy their fruits ye shall know them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d were an\ninterpolation, the Doctor was the better Christian of the two. Whatever\nhis senior deacon might think about it, he said to himself that he\nshouldn't be surprised if he met the Doctor in heaven yet, inquiring\nanxiously after old Deacon Shearer.\n\nHe was on the point of expressing himself very frankly to the Doctor,\nwith that benevolent smile on his face which had sometimes come near\ngiving offence to the readers of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cVinegar\u00e2\u0080\u009d edition, but he saw that\nthe physician's attention had been arrested by Elsie. He looked in the\nsame direction himself, and could not help being struck by her attitude\nand expression. There was something singularly graceful in the curves of\nher neck and the rest of her figure, but she was so perfectly still that\nit seemed as if she were hardly breathing. Her eyes were fixed on the\nyoung girl with whom Mr. Bernard was talking. He had often noticed their\nbrilliancy, but now it seemed to him that they appeared dull, and the\nlook on her features was as of some passion which had missed its stroke.\nMr. Bernard's companion seemed unconscious that she was the object\nof this attention, and was listening to the young master as if he had\nsucceeded in making himself very agreeable.\n\nOf course Dick Veneer had not mistaken the game that was going on. The\nschoolmaster meant to make Elsie jealous,--and he had done it. That 's\nit: get her savage first, and then come wheedling round her,--a sure\ntrick, if he isn't headed off somehow. But Dick saw well enough that he\nhad better let Elsie alone just now, and thought the best way of killing\nthe evening would be to amuse himself in a little lively talk with\nMrs. Blanche Creamer, and incidentally to show Elsie that he could make\nhimself acceptable to other women, if not to herself.\n\nThe Doctor presently went up to Elsie, determined to engage her in\nconversation and get her out of her thoughts, which he saw, by her look,\nwere dangerous. Her father had been on the point of leaving Helen Darley\nto go to her, but felt easy enough when he saw the old Doctor at her\nside, and so went on talking. The Reverend Doctor, being now left alone,\nengaged the Widow Rowens, who put the best face on her vexation she\ncould, but was devoting herself to all the underground deities for\nhaving been such a fool as to ask that pale-faced thing from the\nInstitute to fill up her party.\n\nThere is no space left to report the rest of the conversation. If there\nwas anything of any significance in it, it will turn up by and by, no\ndoubt. At ten o'clock the Reverend Doctor called Miss Letty, who had no\nidea it was so late; Mr. Bernard gave his arm to Helen; Mr. Richard saw\nto Mrs. Blanche Creamer; the Doctor gave Elsie a cautioning look, and\nwent off alone, thoughtful; Dudley Venner and his daughter got into\ntheir carriage and were whirled away. The Widow's gambit was played, and\nshe had not won the game.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. THE WILD HUNTSMAN.\n\nThe young master had not forgotten the old Doctor's cautions. Without\nattributing any great importance to the warning he had given him, Mr.\nBernard had so far complied with his advice that he was becoming a\npretty good shot with the pistol. It was an amusement as good as many\nothers to practise, and he had taken a fancy to it after the first few\ndays.\n\nThe popping of a pistol at odd hours in the backyard of the Institute\nwas a phenomenon more than sufficiently remarkable to be talked about\nin Rockland. The viscous intelligence of a country-village is not easily\nstirred by the winds which ripple the fluent thought of great cities,\nbut it holds every straw and entangles every insect that lights upon it.\nIt soon became rumored in the town that the young master was a wonderful\nshot with the pistol. Some said he could hit a fo'pence-ha'penny at\nthree rod; some, that he had shot a swallow, flying, with a single ball;\nsome, that he snuffed a candle five times out of six at ten paces, and\nthat he could hit any button in a man's coat he wanted to. In other\nwords, as in all such cases, all the common feats were ascribed to him,\nas the current jokes of the day are laid at the door of any noted wit,\nhowever innocent he may be of them.\n\nIn the natural course of things, Mr. Richard Venner, who had by this\ntime made some acquaintances, as we have seen, among that class of the\npopulation least likely to allow a live cinder of gossip to go out for\nwant of air, had heard incidentally that the master up there at the\nInstitute was all the time practising with a pistol, that they say\nhe can snuff a candle at ten rods, (that was Mrs. Blanche Creamer's\nversion,) and that he could hit anybody he wanted to right in the eye,\nas far as he could see the white of it.\n\nDick did not like the sound of all this any too well. Without believing\nmore than half of it, there was enough to make the Yankee schoolmaster\ntoo unsafe to be trifled with. However, shooting at a mark was pleasant\nwork enough; he had no particular objection to it himself. Only he did\nnot care so much for those little popgun affairs that a man carries\nin his pocket, and with which you could n't shoot a fellow,--a robber,\nsay,--without getting the muzzle under his nose. Pistols for boys;\nlong-range rifles for men. There was such a gun lying in a closet with\nthe fowling-pieces. He would go out into the fields and see what he\ncould do as a marksman.\n\nThe nature of the mark which Dick chose for experimenting upon was\nsingular. He had found some panes of glass which had been removed\nfrom an old sash, and he placed these successively before his target,\narranging them at different angles. He found that a bullet would go\nthrough the glass without glancing or having its force materially\nabated. It was an interesting fact in physics, and might prove of some\npractical significance hereafter. Nobody knows what may turn up to\nrender these out-of-the-way facts useful. All this was done in a quiet\nway in one of the bare spots high up the side of The Mountain. He\nwas very thoughtful in taking the precaution to get so far away;\nrifle-bullets are apt to glance and come whizzing about people's ears,\nif they are fired in the neighborhood of houses. Dick satisfied himself\nthat he could be tolerably sure of hitting a pane of glass at a distance\nof thirty rods, more or less, and that, if there happened to be anything\nbehind it, the glass would not materially alter the force or direction\nof the bullet.\n\nAbout this time it occurred to him also that there was an old\naccomplishment of his which he would be in danger of losing for want of\npractice, if he did not take some opportunity to try his hand and regain\nits cunning, if it had begun to be diminished by disuse. For his first\ntrial, he chose an evening when the moon was shining, and after the hour\nwhen the Rockland people were like to be stirring abroad. He was so far\nestablished now that he could do much as he pleased without exciting\nremark.\n\nThe prairie horse he rode, the mustang of the Pampas, wild as he was,\nhad been trained to take part in at least one exercise. This was the\naccomplishment in which Mr. Richard now proposed to try himself. For\nthis purpose he sought the implement of which, as it may be remembered,\nhe had once made an incidental use,--the lasso, or long strip of hide\nwith a slip-noose at the end of it. He had been accustomed to playing\nwith such a thong from his boyhood, and had become expert in its use in\ncapturing wild cattle in the course of his adventures. Unfortunately,\nthere were no wild bulls likely to be met with in the neighborhood, to\nbecome the subjects of his skill. A stray cow in the road, an ox or a\nhorse in a pasture, must serve his turn,--dull beasts, but moving marks\nto aim at, at any rate.\n\nNever, since he had galloped in the chase over the Pampas, had Dick\nVenner felt such a sense of life and power as when he struck the long\nspurs into his wild horse's flanks, and dashed along the road with the\nlasso lying like a coiled snake at the saddle-bow. In skilful hands, the\nsilent, bloodless noose, flying like an arrow, but not like that leaving\na wound behind it,--sudden as a pistol-shot, but without the telltale\nexplosion,--is one of the most fearful and mysterious weapons that arm\nthe hand of man. The old Romans knew how formidable, even in contest\nwith a gladiator equipped with sword, helmet, and shield, was the almost\nnaked retiarius, with his net in one hand and his three-pronged javelin\nin the other. Once get a net over a man's head, or a cord round his\nneck, or, what is more frequently done nowadays, bonnet him by knocking\nhis hat down over his eyes, and he is at the mercy of his opponent. Our\nsoldiers who served against the Mexicans found this out too well. Many\na poor fellow has been lassoed by the fierce riders from the plains,\nand fallen an easy victim to the captor who had snared him in the fatal\nnoose.\n\nBut, imposing as the sight of the wild huntsmen of the Pampas might\nhave been, Dick could not help laughing at the mock sublimity of his\nsituation, as he tried his first experiment on an unhappy milky mother\nwho had strayed from her herd and was wandering disconsolately along\nthe road, laying the dust, as slue went, with thready streams from her\nswollen, swinging udders. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere goes the Don at the windmill!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nDick, and tilted full speed at her, whirling the lasso round his head as\nhe rode. The creature swerved to one side of the way, as the wild horse\nand his rider came rushing down upon her, and presently turned and ran,\nas only cows and it would n't be safe to say it--can run. Just before\nhe passed,--at twenty or thirty feet from her,--the lasso shot from his\nhand, uncoiling as it flew, and in an instant its loop was round\nher horns. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell cast!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dick, as he galloped up to her side and\ndexterously disengaged the lasso. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow for a horse on the run!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe had the good luck to find one, presently, grazing in a pasture at the\nroad-side. Taking down the rails of the fence at one point, he drove the\nhorse into the road and gave chase. It was a lively young animal enough,\nand was easily roused to a pretty fast pace. As his gallop grew more\nand more rapid, Dick gave the reins to the mustang, until the two horses\nstretched themselves out in their longest strides. If the first feat\nlooked like play, the one he was now to attempt had a good deal the\nappearance of real work. He touched the mustang with the spur, and in a\nfew fierce leaps found himself nearly abreast of the frightened animal\nhe was chasing. Once more he whirled the lasso round and round over his\nhead, and then shot it forth, as the rattlesnake shoots his head from\nthe loops against which it rests. The noose was round the horse's neck,\nand in another instant was tightened so as almost to stop his breath.\nThe prairie horse knew the trick of the cord, and leaned away from the\ncaptive, so as to keep the thong tensely stretched between his neck and\nthe peak of the saddle to which it was fastened. Struggling was of no\nuse with a halter round his windpipe, and he very soon began to tremble\nand stagger,--blind, no doubt, and with a roaring in his ears as of a\nthousand battle-trumpets,--at any rate, subdued and helpless. That was\nenough. Dick loosened his lasso, wound it up again, laid it like a pet\nsnake in a coil at his saddle-bow, turned his horse, and rode slowly\nalong towards the mansion-house.\n\nThe place had never looked more stately and beautiful to him than as\nhe now saw it in the moonlight. The undulations of the land,--the grand\nmountain screen which sheltered the mansion from the northern blasts,\nrising with all its hanging forests and parapets of naked rock high\ntowards the heavens,--the ancient mansion, with its square chimneys, and\nbodyguard of old trees, and cincture of low walls with marble-pillared\ngateways,--the fields, with their various coverings,--the beds of\nflowers,--the plots of turf, one with a gray column in its centre\nbearing a sundial on which the rays of the moon were idly shining,\nanother with a white stone and a narrow ridge of turf,--over all these\nobjects, harmonized with all their infinite details into one fair whole\nby the moonlight, the prospective heir, as he deemed himself, looked\nwith admiring eyes.\n\nBut while he looked, the thought rose up in his mind like waters from a\npoisoned fountain, that there was a deep plot laid to cheat him of the\ninheritance which by a double claim he meant to call his own. Every day\nthis ice-cold beauty, this dangerous, handsome cousin of his, went up to\nthat place,--that usher's girl-trap. Everyday,--regularly now,--it used\nto be different. Did she go only to get out of his, her cousin's, reach?\nWas she not rather becoming more and more involved in the toils of this\nplotting Yankee?\n\nIf Mr. Bernard had shown himself at that moment a few rods in advance,\nthe chances are that in less than one minute he would have found\nhimself with a noose round his neck, at the heels of a mounted horseman.\nProvidence spared him for the present. Mr. Richard rode his horse\nquietly round to the stable, put him up, and proceeded towards the\nhouse. He got to his bed without disturbing the family, but could not\nsleep. The idea had fully taken possession of his mind that a deep\nintrigue was going on which would end by bringing Elsie and the\nschoolmaster into relations fatal to all his own hopes. With that\ningenuity which always accompanies jealousy, he tortured every\ncircumstance of the last few weeks so as to make it square with this\nbelief. From this vein of thought he naturally passed to a consideration\nof every possible method by which the issue he feared might be avoided.\n\nMr. Richard talked very plain language with himself in all these inward\ncolloquies. Supposing it came to the worst, what could be done then?\nFirst, an accident might happen to the schoolmaster which should put\na complete and final check upon his projects and contrivances. The\nparticular accident which might interrupt his career must, evidently,\nbe determined by circumstances; but it must be of a nature to explain\nitself without the necessity of any particular person's becoming\ninvolved in the matter. It would be unpleasant to go into particulars;\nbut everybody knows well enough that men sometimes get in the way of\na stray bullet, and that young persons occasionally do violence to\nthemselves in various modes,--by firearms, suspension, and other\nmeans,--in consequence of disappointment in love, perhaps, oftener than\nfrom other motives. There was still another kind of accident which might\nserve his purpose. If anything should happen to Elsie, it would be the\nmost natural thing in the world that his uncle should adopt him, his\nnephew and only near relation, as his heir. Unless, indeed, uncle Dudley\nshould take it into his head to marry again. In that case, where would\nhe, Dick, be? This was the most detestable complication which he could\nconceive of. And yet he had noticed--he could not help noticing--that\nhis uncle had been very attentive to, and, as it seemed, very much\npleased with, that young woman from the school. What did that mean? Was\nit possible that he was going to take a fancy to her?\n\nIt made him wild to think of all the several contingencies which might\ndefraud him of that good-fortune which seemed but just now within his\ngrasp. He glared in the darkness at imaginary faces: sometimes at that\nof the handsome, treacherous schoolmaster; sometimes at that of the\nmeek-looking, but no doubt, scheming, lady-teacher; sometimes at that of\nthe dark girl whom he was ready to make his wife; sometimes at that of\nhis much respected uncle, who, of course, could not be allowed to peril\nthe fortunes of his relatives by forming a new connection. It was a\nfrightful perplexity in which he found himself, because there was no\none single life an accident to which would be sufficient to insure the\nfitting and natural course of descent to the great Dudley property. If\nit had been a simple question of helping forward a casualty to any one\nperson, there was nothing in Dick's habits of thought and living to make\nthat a serious difficulty. He had been so much with lawless people, that\na life between his wish and his object seemed only as an obstacle to\nbe removed, provided the object were worth the risk and trouble. But if\nthere were two or three lives in the way, manifestly that altered the\ncase.\n\nHis Southern blood was getting impatient. There was enough of the\nNew-Englander about him to make him calculate his chances before he\nstruck; but his plans were liable to be defeated at any moment by a\npassionate impulse such as the dark-hued races of Southern Europe and\ntheir descendants are liable to. He lay in his bed, sometimes arranging\nplans to meet the various difficulties already mentioned, sometimes\ngetting into a paroxysm of blind rage in the perplexity of considering\nwhat object he should select as the one most clearly in his way. On the\nwhole, there could be no doubt where the most threatening of all his\nembarrassments lay. It was in the probable growing relation between\nElsie and the schoolmaster. If it should prove, as it seemed likely,\nthat there was springing up a serious attachment tending to a union\nbetween them, he knew what he should do, if he was not quite so sure how\nhe should do it.\n\nThere was one thing at least which might favor his projects, and which,\nat any rate, would serve to amuse him. He could, by a little quiet\nobservation, find out what were the schoolmaster's habits of life:\nwhether he had any routine which could be calculated upon; and under\nwhat circumstances a strictly private interview of a few minutes with\nhim might be reckoned on, in case it should be desirable. He could also\nvery probably learn some facts about Elsie, whether the young man was\nin the habit of attending her on her way home from school; whether she\nstayed about the schoolroom after the other girls had gone; and any\nincidental matters of interest which might present themselves.\n\nHe was getting more and more restless for want of some excitement. A mad\ngallop, a visit to Mrs. Blanche Creamer, who had taken such a fancy to\nhim, or a chat with the Widow Rowens, who was very lively in her talk,\nfor all her sombre colors, and reminded him a good deal of same of his\nearlier friends, the senoritas,--all these were distractions, to be\nsure, but not enough to keep his fiery spirit from fretting itself\nin longings for more dangerous excitements. The thought of getting a\nknowledge of all Mr. Bernard's ways, so that he would be in his power at\nany moment, was a happy one.\n\nFor some days after this he followed Elsie at a long distance behind, to\nwatch her until she got to the schoolhouse. One day he saw Mr. Bernard\njoin her: a mere accident, very probably, for it was only once this\nhappened. She came on her homeward way alone,--quite apart from the\ngroups of girls who strolled out of the schoolhouse yard in company.\nSometimes she was behind them all,--which was suggestive. Could she have\nstayed to meet the schoolmaster?\n\nIf he could have smuggled himself into the school, he would have liked\nto watch her there, and see if there was not some understanding between\nher and the master which betrayed itself by look or word. But this was\nbeyond the limits of his audacity, and he had to content himself with\nsuch cautious observations as could be made at a distance. With the aid\nof a pocket-glass he could make out persons without the risk of being\nobserved himself.\n\nMr. Silos Peckham's corps of instructors was not expected to be off duty\nor to stand at ease for any considerable length of time. Sometimes Mr.\nBernard, who had more freedom than the rest, would go out for a ramble\nin the daytime, but more frequently it would be in the evening, after\nthe hour of \u00e2\u0080\u009cretiring,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as bedtime was elegantly termed by the young\nladies of the Apollinean Institute. He would then not unfrequently walk\nout alone in the common roads, or climb up the sides of The Mountain,\nwhich seemed to be one of his favorite resorts. Here, of course, it was\nimpossible to follow him with the eye at a distance. Dick had a hideous,\ngnawing suspicion that somewhere in these deep shades the schoolmaster\nmight meet Elsie, whose evening wanderings he knew so well. But of this\nhe was not able to assure himself. Secrecy was necessary to his present\nplans, and he could not compromise himself by over-eager curiosity. One\nthing he learned with certainty. The master returned, after his walk one\nevening, and entered the building where his room was situated. Presently\na light betrayed the window of his apartment. From a wooded bank, some\nthirty or forty rods from this building, Dick Venner could see the\ninterior of the chamber, and watch the master as he sat at his desk, the\nlight falling strongly upon his face, intent upon the book or manuscript\nbefore him. Dick contemplated him very long in this attitude. The sense\nof watching his every motion, himself meanwhile utterly unseen, was\ndelicious. How little the master was thinking what eyes were on him!\n\nWell,--there were two things quite certain. One was, that, if he chose,\nhe could meet the schoolmaster alone, either in the road or in a more\nsolitary place, if he preferred to watch his chance for an evening or\ntwo. The other was, that he commanded his position, as he sat at his\ndesk in the evening, in such a way that there would be very little\ndifficulty,--so far as that went; of course, however, silence is always\npreferable to noise, and there is a great difference in the marks left\nby different casualties. Very likely nothing would come of all this\nespionage; but, at any rate, the first thing to be done with a man you\nwant to have in your power is to learn his habits.\n\nSince the tea-party at the Widow Rowens's, Elsie had been more fitful\nand moody than ever. Dick understood all this well enough, you know. It\nwas the working of her jealousy against that young schoolgirl to whom\nthe master had devoted himself for the sake of piquing the heiress\nof the Dudley mansion. Was it possible, in any way, to exasperate\nher irritable nature against him, and in this way to render her more\naccessible to his own advances? It was difficult to influence her at\nall. She endured his company without seeming to enjoy it. She watched\nhim with that strange look of hers, sometimes as if she were on her\nguard against him, sometimes as if she would like to strike at him as\nin that fit of childish passion. She ordered him about with a haughty\nindifference which reminded him of his own way with the dark-eyed women\nwhom he had known so well of old. All this added a secret pleasure to\nthe other motives he had for worrying her with jealous suspicions. He\nknew she brooded silently on any grief that poisoned her comfort,--that\nshe fed on it, as it were, until it ran with every drop of blood in her\nveins,--and that, except in some paroxysm of rage, of which he himself\nwas not likely the second time to be the object, or in some deadly\nvengeance wrought secretly, against which he would keep a sharp lookout,\nso far as he was concerned, she had no outlet for her dangerous,\nsmouldering passions.\n\nBeware of the woman who cannot find free utterance for all her stormy\ninner life either in words or song! So long as a woman can talk, there\nis nothing she cannot bear. If she cannot have a companion to listen to\nher woes, and has no musical utterance, vocal or instrumental,--then, if\nshe is of the real woman sort, and has a few heartfuls of wild blood in\nher, and you have done her a wrong,--double-bolt the door which she may\nenter on noiseless slipper at midnight,--look twice before you taste of\nany cup whose draught the shadow of her hand may have darkened!\n\nBut let her talk, and, above all, cry, or, if she is one of the\ncoarser-grained tribe, give her the run of all the red-hot expletives in\nthe language, and let her blister her lips with them until she is tired,\nshe will sleep like a lamb after it, and you may take a cup of coffee\nfrom her without stirring it up to look for its sediment.\n\nSo, if she can sing, or play on any musical instrument, all her\nwickedness will run off through her throat or the tips of her fingers.\nHow many tragedies find their peaceful catastrophe in fierce roulades\nand strenuous bravuras! How many murders are executed in double-quick\ntime upon the keys which stab the air with their dagger-strokes of\nsound! What would our civilization be without the piano? Are not Erard\nand Broadwood and Chickering the true humanizers of our time? Therefore\ndo I love to hear the all-pervading tum tum jarring the walls of little\nparlors in houses with double door-plates on their portals, looking out\non streets and courts which to know is to be unknown, and where to exist\nis not to live, according to any true definition of living. Therefore\ncomplain I not of modern degeneracy, when, even from the open window of\nthe small unlovely farmhouse, tenanted by the hard-handed man of bovine\nflavors and the flat-patterned woman of broken-down countenance, issue\nthe same familiar sounds. For who knows that Almira, but for these keys,\nwhich throb away her wild impulses in harmless discords would not\nhave been floating, dead, in the brown stream which slides through the\nmeadows by her father's door,--or living, with that other current\nwhich runs beneath the gas-lights over the slimy pavement, choking with\nwretched weeds that were once in spotless flower?\n\nPoor Elsie! She never sang nor played. She never shaped her inner life\nin words: such utterance was as much denied to her nature as common\narticulate speech to the deaf mute. Her only language must be in action.\nWatch her well by day and by night, old Sophy! watch her well! or\nthe long line of her honored name may close in shame, and the stately\nmansion of the Dudleys remain a hissing and a reproach till its roof is\nburied in its cellar!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. ON HIS TRACKS.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAble!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old Doctor, one morning, \u00e2\u0080\u009cafter you've harnessed\nCaustic, come into the study a few minutes, will you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAbel nodded. He was a man of few words, and he knew that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill you\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n did not require an answer, being the true New-England way of rounding\nthe corners of an employer's order,--a tribute to the personal\nindependence of an American citizen.\n\nThe hired man came into the study in the course of a few minutes.\nHis face was perfectly still, and he waited to be spoken to; but the\nDoctor's eye detected a certain meaning in his expression, which looked\nas if he had something to communicate.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe's up to mischief o' some kind, I guess,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Abel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI jest happened\ndaown by the mansion-haouse last night, 'n' he come aout o' the gate\non that queer-lookin' creator' o' his. I watched him, 'n' he rid, very\nslow, all raoun' by the Institoot, 'n' acted as ef he was spyin' abaout.\nHe looks to me like a man that's calc'latin' to do some kind of ill-turn\nto somebody. I should n't like to have him raoun' me, 'f there wa'n't\na pitchfork or an eel-spear or some sech weep'n within reach. He may be\nall right; but I don't like his looks, 'n' I don't see what he's lurkin'\nraoun' the Institoot for, after folks is abed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you watched him pretty close for the last few days?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nDoctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cW'll, yes,--I've had my eye on him consid'ble o' the time. I haf to be\npooty shy abaout it, or he'll find aout th't I'm on his tracks. I don'\nwant him to get a spite ag'inst me, 'f I c'n help it; he looks to me\nlike one o' them kind that kerries what they call slung-shot, 'n' hits\nye on the side o' th' head with 'em so suddin y' never know what hurts\nye.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, sharply,--\u00e2\u0080\u009chave you ever seen him with any such\nweapon about him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cW'll, no,--I caan't say that I hev,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Abel answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn'y he looks kin'\no' dangerous. Maybe he's all jest 'z he ought to be,--I caan't say that\nhe a'n't,--but he's aout late nights, 'n' lurkin' raonn' jest 'z ef\nhe was spyin' somebody, 'n' somehaow I caan't help mistrustin' them\nPortagee-lookin' fellahs. I caan't keep the run o' this chap all the\ntime; but I've a notion that old black woman daown 't the mansion-haouse\nknows 'z much abaout him 'z anybody.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor paused a moment, after hearing this report from his private\ndetective, and then got into his chaise, and turned Caustic's head in\nthe direction of the Dudley mansion. He had been suspicious of Dick from\nthe first. He did not like his mixed blood, nor his looks, nor his\nways. He had formed a conjecture about his projects early. He had made\na shrewd guess as to the probable jealousy Dick would feel of the\nschoolmaster, had found out something of his movements, and had\ncautioned Mr. Bernard,--as we have seen. He felt an interest in\nthe young man,--a student of his own profession, an intelligent and\ningenuously unsuspecting young fellow, who had been thrown by accident\ninto the companionship or the neighborhood of two persons, one of whom\nhe knew to be dangerous, and the other he believed instinctively might\nbe capable of crime.\n\nThe Doctor rode down to the Dudley mansion solely for the sake of seeing\nold Sophy. He was lucky enough to find her alone in her kitchen.\nHe began taking with her as a physician; he wanted to know how her\nrheumatism had been. The shrewd old woman saw through all that with her\nlittle beady black eyes. It was something quite different he had come\nfor, and old Sophy answered very briefly for her aches and ails.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOld folks' bones a'n't like young folks',\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's the Lord's\ndoin's, 'n' 't a'n't much matter. I sha'n' be long roan' this kitchen.\nIt's the young Missis, Doctor,--it 's our Elsie,--it 's the baby, as we\nuse' t' call her,--don' you remember, Doctor? Seventeen year ago, 'n'\nher poor mother cryin' for her,--'Where is she? where is she? Let me see\nher! '--'n' how I run up-stairs,--I could run then,--'n' got the coral\nnecklace 'n' put it round her little neck, 'n' then showed her to her\nmother,--'n' how her mother looked at her, 'n' looked, 'n' then put out\nher poor thin fingers 'n' lifted the necklace,--'n' fell right back on\nher piller, as white as though she was laid out to bury?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor answered her by silence and a look of grave assent. He had\nnever chosen to let old Sophy dwell upon these matters, for obvious\nreasons. The girl must not grow up haunted by perpetual fears and\nprophecies, if it were possible to prevent it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, how has Elsie seemed of late?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, after this brief pause.\n\nThe old woman shook her head. Then she looked up at the Doctor so\nsteadily and searchingly that the diamond eyes of Elsie herself could\nhardly have pierced more deeply.\n\nThe Doctor raised his head, by his habitual movement, and met the old\nwoman's look with his own calm and scrutinizing gaze, sharpened by the\nglasses through which he now saw her.\n\nSophy spoke presently in an awed tone, as if telling a vision.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe shall be havin' trouble before long. The' 's somethin' comin'\nfrom the Lord. I've had dreams, Doctor. It's many a year I've been\na-dreamin', but now they're comin' over 'n' over the same thing. Three\ntimes I've dreamed one thing, Doctor,--one thing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what was that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor said, with that shade of curiosity\nin his tone which a metaphysician would probably say is an index of a\ncertain tendency to belief in the superstition to which the question\nrefers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI ca'n' jestly tell y' what it was, Doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the old woman answered,\nas if bewildered and trying to clear up her recollections; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it\nwas somethin' fearful, with a great noise 'n' a great cryin' o'\npeople,--like the Las' Day, Doctor! The Lord have mercy on my poor\nchil', 'n' take care of her, if anything happens! But I's feared she'll\nnever live to see the Las' Day, 'f 't don' come pooty quick.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPoor Sophy, only the third generation from cannibalism, was, not\nunnaturally, somewhat confused in her theological notions. Some of the\nSecond-Advent preachers had been about, and circulated their predictions\namong the kitchen--population of Rockland. This was the way in which it\nhappened that she mingled her fears in such a strange manner with their\ndoctrines.\n\nThe Doctor answered solemnly, that of the day and hour we knew not, but\nit became us to be always ready.--\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs there anything going on in the\nhousehold different from common?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOld Sophy's wrinkled face looked as full of life and intelligence,\nwhen she turned it full upon the Doctor, as if she had slipped off her\ninfirmities and years like an outer garment. All those fine instincts\nof observation which came straight to her from her savage grandfather\nlooked out of her little eyes. She had a kind of faith that the Doctor\nwas a mighty conjurer, who, if he would, could bewitch any of them. She\nhad relieved her feelings by her long talk with the minister, but the\nDoctor was the immediate adviser of the family, and had watched them\nthrough all their troubles. Perhaps he could tell them what to do. She\nhad but one real object of affection in the world,--this child that\nshe had tended from infancy to womanhood. Troubles were gathering thick\nround her; how soon they would break upon her, and blight or destroy\nher, no one could tell; but there was nothing in all the catalogue of\nterrors which might not come upon the household at any moment. Her own\nwits had sharpened themselves in keeping watch by day and night, and\nher face had forgotten its age in the excitement which gave life to its\nfeatures.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d old Sophy said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere's strange things goin' on here by night\nand by day. I don' like that man,--that Dick,--I never liked him. He\ngiv' me some o' these things I' got on; I take 'em 'cos I know it make\nhim mad, if I no take 'em; I wear 'em, so that he need n' feel as if I\ndid n' like him; but, Doctor, I hate him,--jes' as much as a member of\nthe church has the Lord's leave to hate anybody.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHer eyes sparkled with the old savage light, as if her ill-will to Mr.\nRichard Veneer might perhaps go a little farther than the Christian\nlimit she had assigned. But remember that her grandfather was in the\nhabit of inviting his friends to dine with him upon the last enemy he\nhad bagged, and that her grandmother's teeth were filed down to points,\nso that they were as sharp as a shark's.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is that you have seen about Mr. Richard Veneer that gives you such\na spite against him, Sophy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the Doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I' seen 'bout Dick Veneer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied, fiercely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll tell y'\nwhat I' seen. Dick wan's to marry our Elsie,--that 's what he wan's; 'n'\nhe don' love her, Doctor,--he hates her, Doctor, as bad as I hate him!\nHe wan's to marry our Elsie, In' live here in the big house, 'n' have\nnothin' to do but jes' lay still 'n' watch Massa Venner 'n' see how long\n't Ill take him to die, 'n' 'f he don' die fas' 'puff, help him some\nway t' die fasser!--Come close up t' me, Doctor! I wan' t' tell you\nsomethin' I tol' th' minister t' other day. Th' minister, he come down\n'n' prayed 'n' talked good,--he's a good man, that Doctor Honeywood, 'n'\nI tol' him all 'bout our Elsie, but he did n' tell nobody what to do\nto stop all what I' been dreamin' about happenin'. Come close up to me,\nDoctor!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor drew his chair close up to that of the old woman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoctor, nobody mus'n' never marry our Elsie 's longs she lives! Nobody\nmus' n' never live with Elsie but ol Sophy; 'n' ol Sophy won't never die\n's long 's Elsie 's alive to be took care of. But I's feared, Doctor,\nI's greatly feared Elsie wan' to marry somebody. The' 's a young\ngen'l'm'n up at that school where she go,--so some of 'em tells me, 'n'\nshe loves t' see him 'n' talk wi' him, 'n' she talks about him when she\n's asleep sometimes. She mus 'n' never marry nobody, Doctor! If she do,\nhe die, certain!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf she has a fancy for the young man up at the school there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the\nDoctor said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shouldn't think there would be much danger from Dick.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoctor, nobody know nothin' 'bout Elsie but of Sophy. She no like any\nother creator' th't ever drawed the bref o' life. If she ca'n' marry one\nman 'cos she love him, she marry another man 'cos she hate him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMarry a man because she hates him, Sophy? No woman ever did such a\nthing as that, or ever will do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho tol' you Elsie was a woman, Doctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said old Sophy, with a flash\nof strange intelligence in her eyes.\n\nThe Doctor's face showed that he was startled. The old woman could\nnot know much about Elsie that he did not know; but what strange\nsuperstition had got into her head, he was puzzled to guess. He had\nbetter follow Sophy's lead and find out what she meant.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should call Elsie a woman, and a very handsome one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\ndon't mean that she has any mark about her, except--you know--under the\nnecklace?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old woman resented the thought of any deformity about her darling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did n' say she had nothin'--but jes' that--you know. My beauty have\nanything ugly? She's the beautifullest-shaped lady that ever had a\nshinin' silk gown drawed over her shoulders. On'y she a'n't like no\nother woman in none of her ways. She don't cry 'n' laugh like other\nwomen. An' she ha'n' got the same kind o' feelin's as other women.--Do\nyou know that young gen'l'm'n up at the school, Doctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, Sophy, I've met him sometimes. He's a very nice sort of young\nman, handsome, too, and I don't much wonder Elsie takes to him. Tell me,\nSophy, what do you think would happen, if he should chance to fall in\nlove with Elsie, and she with him, and he should marry her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPut your ear close to my lips, Doctor, dear!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She whispered a little to\nthe Doctor, then added aloud, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe die,--that's all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut surely, Sophy, you a'n't afraid to have Dick marry her, if she\nwould have him for any reason, are you? He can take care of himself, if\nanybody can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoctor!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sophy answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnobody can take care of hisself that live wi'\nElsie! Nobody never in all this worl' mus' live wi' Elsie but of Sophy,\nI tell you. You don' think I care for Dick? What do I care, if Dick\nVenner die? He wan's to marry our Elsie so 's to live in the big house\n'n' get all the money 'n' all the silver things 'n' all the chists full\no' linen 'n' beautiful clothes. That's what Dick wan's. An' he hates\nElsie 'cos she don' like him. But if he marry Elsie, she 'll make him\ndie some wrong way or other, 'n' they'll take her 'n' hang her, or he'll\nget mad with her 'n' choke her.--Oh, I know his chokin' tricks!--he don'\nleave his keys roun' for nothin.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat's that you say, Sophy? Tell me what you mean by all that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo poor Sophy had to explain certain facts not in all respects to her\ncredit. She had taken the opportunity of his absence to look about his\nchamber, and, having found a key in one of his drawers, had applied it\nto a trunk, and, finding that it opened the trunk, had made a kind of\ninspection for contraband articles, and, seeing the end of a leather\nthong, had followed it up until she saw that it finished with a noose,\nwhich, from certain appearances, she inferred to have seen service of at\nleast doubtful nature. An unauthorized search; but old Sophy considered\nthat a game of life and death was going on in the household, and that\nshe was bound to look out for her darling.\n\nThe Doctor paused a moment to think over this odd piece of\ninformation. Without sharing Sophy's belief as to the kind of use this\nmischievous-looking piece of property had been put to, it was certainly\nvery odd that Dick should have such a thing at the bottom of his trunk.\nThe Doctor remembered reading or hearing something about the lasso and\nthe lariat and the bolas, and had an indistinct idea that they had been\nsometimes used as weapons of warfare or private revenge; but they were\nessentially a huntsman's implements, after all, and it was not very\nstrange that this young man had brought one of them with him. Not\nstrange, perhaps, but worth noting.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you really think Dick means mischief to anybody, that he has such\ndangerous-looking things?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor said, presently.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell you, Doctor. Dick means to have Elsie. If he ca'n' get her, he\nnever let nobody else have her! Oh, Dick 's a dark man, Doctor! I know\nhim! I 'member him when he was little boy,--he always cunin'. I think\nhe mean mischief to somebody. He come home late nights,--come in\nsoftly,--oh, I hear him! I lay awake, 'n' got sharp ears,--I hear the\ncats walkin' over the roofs,--'n' I hear Dick Veneer, when he comes up\nin his stockin'-feet as still as a cat. I think he mean' mischief to\nsomebody. I no like his looks these las' days.--Is that a very pooty\ngen'l'm'n up at the schoolhouse, Doctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI told you he was good-looking. What if he is?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should like to see him, Doctor,--I should like to see the pooty\ngen'l'm'n that my poor Elsie loves. She mus 'n' never marry nobody,\n--but, oh, Doctor, I should like to see him, 'n' jes' think a little how\nit would ha' been, if the Lord had n' been so hard on Elsie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe wept and wrung her hands. The kind Doctor was touched, and left her\na moment to her thoughts.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd how does Mr. Dudley Veneer take all this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, by way of\nchanging the subject a little.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Massa Veneer, he good man, but he don' know nothin' 'bout Elsie, as\nof Sophy do. I keep close by her; I help her when she go to bed, 'n' set\nby her sometime when she--'sleep; I come to her in th' mornin' 'n' help\nher put on her things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--Then, in a whisper;--\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoctor, Elsie lets of\nSophy take off that necklace for her. What you think she do, 'f anybody\nelse tech it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know, I'm sure, Sophy,--strike the person, perhaps.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes, strike 'em! but not with her han's, Doctor!\u00e2\u0080\u009d--The old woman's\nsignificant pantomime must be guessed at.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you haven't told me, Sophy, what Mr. Dudley Veneer thinks of his\nnephew, nor whether he has any notion that Dick wants to marry Elsie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell you. Massa Venner, he good man, but he no see nothin' 'bout what\ngoes on here in the house. He sort o' broken-hearted, you know,--sort\no' giv up,--don' know what to do wi' Elsie, 'xcep' say 'Yes, yes.' Dick\nalways look smilin' 'n' behave well before him. One time I thought Massa\nVeneer b'lieve Dick was goin' to take to Elsie; but now he don' seem\nto take much notice,--he kin' o' stupid-' like 'bout sech things. It's\ntrouble, Doctor; 'cos Massa Veneer bright man naterally,--'n' he's got\na great heap o' books. I don' think Massa Veneer never been jes' heself\nsence Elsie 's born. He done all he know how,--but, Doctor, that wa'n' a\ngreat deal. You men-folks don' know nothin' 'bout these young gals;\n'n' 'f you knowed all the young gals that ever lived, y' would n' know\nnothin' 'bout our Elsie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,--but, Sophy, what I want to know is, whether you think Mr. Veneer\nhas any kind of suspicion about his nephew,--whether he has any notion\nthat he's a dangerous sort of fellow,--or whether he feels safe to have\nhim about, or has even taken a sort of fancy to him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLar' bless you, Doctor, Massa Veneer no more idee 'f any mischief\n'bout Dick than he has 'bout you or me. Y' see, he very fond o' the\nCap'n,--that Dick's father,--'n' he live so long alone here, 'long wi'\nus, that he kin' o' like to see mos' anybody 't 's got any o' th' of\nfamily-blood in 'em. He ha'n't got no more suspicions 'n a baby,--y'\nnever see sech a man 'n y'r life. I kin' o' think he don' care for\nnothin' in this world 'xcep' jes' t' do what Elsie wan's him to. The\nfus' year after young Madam die he do nothin' but jes' set at the window\n'n' look out at her grave, 'n' then come up 'n' look at the baby's neck\n'n' say, 'It's fadin', Sophy, a'n't it? 'n' then go down in the study\n'n' walk 'n' walk, 'n' them kneel down 'n' pray. Doctor, there was two\nplaces in the old carpet that was all threadbare, where his knees had\nworn 'em. An' sometimes, you remember 'bout all that,--he'd go off up\ninto The Mountain, 'n' be gone all day, 'n' kill all the Ugly Things\nhe could find up there.--Oh, Doctor, I don' like to think o' them\ndays!--An' by 'n' by he grew kin' o' still, 'n' begun to read a little,\n'n' 't las' he got 's quiet's a lamb, 'n' that's the way he is now. I\nthink he's got religion, Doctor; but he a'n't so bright about what's\ngoin' on, 'n' I don' believe he never suspec' nothin' till somethin'\nhappens; for the' 's somethin' goin' to happen, Doctor, if the Las' Day\ndoes n' come to stop it; 'n' you mus' tell us what to do, 'n' save my\npoor Elsie, my baby that the Lord has n' took care of like all his other\nchilder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor assured the old woman that he was thinking a great deal about\nthem all, and that there were other eyes on Dick besides her own. Let\nher watch him closely about the house, and he would keep a look-out\nelsewhere. If there was anything new, she must let him know at once.\nSend up one of the menservants, and he would come down at a moment's\nwarning.\n\nThere was really nothing definite against this young man; but the Doctor\nwas sure that he was meditating some evil design or other. He rode\nstraight up to the Institute. There he saw Mr. Bernard, and had a brief\nconversation with him, principally on matters relating to his personal\ninterests.\n\nThat evening, for some unknown reason, Mr. Bernard changed the place of\nhis desk and drew down the shades of his windows. Late that night Mr.\nRichard Venner drew the charge of a rifle, and put the gun back among\nthe fowling-pieces, swearing that a leather halter was worth a dozen of\nit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. THE PERILOUS HOUR.\n\nUp to this time Dick Venner had not decided on the particular mode\nand the precise period of relieving himself from the unwarrantable\ninterference which threatened to defeat his plans. The luxury of feeling\nthat he had his man in his power was its own reward. One who watches\nin the dark, outside, while his enemy, in utter unconsciousness, is\nilluminating his apartment and himself so that every movement of his\nhead and every button on his coat can be seen and counted, experiences a\npeculiar kind of pleasure, if he holds a loaded rifle in his hand, which\nhe naturally hates to bring to its climax by testing his skill as a\nmarksman upon the object of his attention.\n\nBesides, Dick had two sides in his nature, almost as distinct as we\nsometimes observe in those persons who are the subjects of the condition\nknown as double consciousness. On his New England side he was cunning\nand calculating, always cautious, measuring his distance before he\nrisked his stroke, as nicely as if he were throwing his lasso. But\nhe was liable to intercurrent fits of jealousy and rage, such as the\nlight-hued races are hardly capable of conceiving, blinding paroxysms of\npassion, which for the time overmastered him, and which, if they found\nno ready outlet, transformed themselves into the more dangerous forces\nthat worked through the instrumentality of his cool craftiness.\n\nHe had failed as yet in getting any positive evidence that there was\nany relation between Elsie and the schoolmaster other than such as might\nexist unsuspected and unblamed between a teacher and his pupil. A book,\nor a note, even, did not prove the existence of any sentiment. At one\ntime he would be devoured by suspicions, at another he would try to\nlaugh himself out of them. And in the mean while he followed Elsie's\ntastes as closely as he could, determined to make some impression upon\nher,--to become a habit, a convenience, a necessity,--whatever might aid\nhim in the attainment of the one end which was now the aim of his life.\n\nIt was to humor one of her tastes already known to the reader, that he\nsaid to her one morning,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, Elsie, take your castanets, and let us\nhave a dance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe had struck the right vein in the girl's fancy, for she was in the\nmood for this exercise, and very willingly led the way into one of the\nmore empty apartments. What there was in this particular kind of dance\nwhich excited her it might not be easy to guess; but those who looked\nin with the old Doctor, on a former occasion, and saw her, will remember\nthat she was strangely carried away by it, and became almost fearful in\nthe vehemence of her passion. The sound of the castanets seemed to make\nher alive all over. Dick knew well enough what the exhibition would\nbe, and was almost afraid of her at these moments; for it was like\nthe dancing mania of Eastern devotees, more than the ordinary light\namusement of joyous youth,--a convulsion of the body and the mind,\nrather than a series of voluntary modulated motions.\n\nElsie rattled out the triple measure of a saraband. Her eyes began to\nglitter more brilliantly, and her shape to undulate in freer curves.\nPresently she noticed that Dick's look was fixed upon her necklace. His\nface betrayed his curiosity; he was intent on solving the question, why\nshe always wore something about her neck. The chain of mosaics she had\non at that moment displaced itself at every step, and he was peering\nwith malignant, searching eagerness to see if an unsunned ring of\nfairer hue than the rest of the surface, or any less easily explained\npeculiarity, were hidden by her ornaments.\n\nShe stopped suddenly, caught the chain of mosaics and settled it hastily\nin its place, flung down her castanets, drew herself back, and stood\nlooking at him, with her head a little on one side, and her eyes\nnarrowing in the way he had known so long and well.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the matter, Cousin Elsie? What do you stop for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nElsie did not answer, but kept her eyes on him, full of malicious light.\nThe jealousy which lay covered up under his surface-thoughts took this\nopportunity to break out.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou would n't act so, if you were dancing with Mr. Langdon,--would you,\nElsie?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\nIt was with some effort that he looked steadily at her to see the effect\nof his question.\n\nElsie colored,--not much, but still perceptibly. Dick could not remember\nthat he had ever seen her show this mark of emotion before, in all his\nexperience of her fitful changes of mood. It had a singular depth of\nsignificance, therefore, for him; he knew how hardly her color came.\nBlushing means nothing, in some persons; in others, it betrays a\nprofound inward agitation,--a perturbation of the feelings far more\ntrying than the passions which with many easily moved persons break\nforth in tears. All who have observed much are aware that some men,\nwho have seen a good deal of life in its less chastened aspects and\nare anything but modest, will blush often and easily, while there\nare delicate and sensitive women who can faint, or go into fits, if\nnecessary, but are very rarely seen to betray their feelings in their\ncheeks, even when their expression shows that their inmost soul is\nblushing scarlet. Presently she answered, abruptly and scornfully, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr.\nLangdon is a gentleman, and would not vex me as you do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA gentleman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dick answered, with the most insulting accent,--\u00e2\u0080\u009ca\ngentleman! Come, Elsie, you 've got the Dudley blood in your veins,\nand it does n't do for you to call this poor, sneaking schoolmaster a\ngentleman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe stopped short. Elsie's bosom was heaving, the faint flush on her\ncheek was becoming a vivid glow. Whether it were shame or wrath, he\nsaw that he had reached some deep-lying centre of emotion. There was no\nlonger any doubt in his mind. With another girl these signs of confusion\nmight mean little or nothing; with her they were decisive and final.\nElsie Venner loved Bernard Langdon.\n\nThe sudden conviction, absolute, overwhelming, which rushed upon him,\nhad well-nigh led to an explosion of wrath, and perhaps some terrible\nscene which might have fulfilled some of old Sophy's predictions. This,\nhowever, would never do. Dick's face whitened with his thoughts, but he\nkept still until he could speak calmly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI've nothing against the young fellow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009conly I don't think\nthere's anything quite good enough to keep the company of people that\nhave the Dudley blood in them. You a'n't as proud as I am. I can't quite\nmake up my mind to call a schoolmaster a gentleman, though this one may\nbe well enough. I 've nothing against him, at any rate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nElsie made no answer, but glided out of the room and slid away to her\nown apartment. She bolted the door and drew her curtains close. Then she\nthrew herself on the floor, and fell into a dull, slow ache of passion,\nwithout tears, without words, almost without thoughts. So she remained,\nperhaps, for a half-hour, at the end of which time it seemed that her\npassion had become a sullen purpose. She arose, and, looking cautiously\nround, went to the hearth, which was ornamented with curious old Dutch\ntiles, with pictures of Scripture subjects. One of these represented\nthe lifting of the brazen serpent. She took a hair-pin from one of her\nbraids, and, insinuating its points under the edge of the tile, raised\nit from its place. A small leaden box lay under the tile, which she\nopened, and, taking from it a little white powder, which she folded in a\nscrap of paper, replaced the box and the tile over it.\n\nWhether Dick had by any means got a knowledge of this proceeding, or\nwhether he only suspected some unmentionable design on her part, there\nis no sufficient means of determining. At any rate, when they met, an\nhour or two after these occurrences, he could not help noticing how\neasily she seemed to have got over her excitement. She was very pleasant\nwith him,--too pleasant, Dick thought. It was not Elsie's way to come\nout of a fit of anger so easily as that. She had contrived some way of\nletting off her spite; that was certain. Dick was pretty cunning, as old\nSophy had said, and, whether or not he had any means of knowing Elsie's\nprivate intentions, watched her closely, and was on his guard against\naccidents.\n\nFor the first time, he took certain precautions with reference to his\ndiet, such as were quite alien to his common habits. On coming to the\ndinner-table, that day, he complained of headache, took but little food,\nand refused the cup of coffee which Elsie offered him, saying that it\ndid not agree with him when he had these attacks.\n\nHere was a new complication. Obviously enough, he could not live in this\nway, suspecting everything but plain bread and water, and hardly feeling\nsafe in meddling with them. Not only had this school-keeping wretch come\nbetween him and the scheme by which he was to secure his future fortune,\nbut his image had so infected his cousin's mind that she was ready to\ntry on him some of those tricks which, as he had heard hinted in the\nvillage, she had once before put in practice upon a person who had\nbecome odious to her.\n\nSomething must be done, and at once, to meet the double necessities of\nthis case. Every day, while the young girl was in these relations with\nthe young man, was only making matters worse. They could exchange words\nand looks, they could arrange private interviews, they would be stooping\ntogether over the same book, her hair touching his cheek, her breath\nmingling with his, all the magnetic attractions drawing them together\nwith strange, invisible effluences. As her passion for the schoolmaster\nincreased, her dislike to him, her cousin, would grow with it, and all\nhis dangers would be multiplied. It was a fearful point he had, reached.\nHe was tempted at one moment to give up all his plans and to disappear\nsuddenly from the place, leaving with the schoolmaster, who had\ncome between him and his object, an anonymous token of his personal\nsentiments which would be remembered a good while in the history of the\ntown of Rockland. This was but a momentary thought; the great Dudley\nproperty could not be given up in that way.\n\nSomething must happen at once to break up all this order of things. He\ncould think of but one Providential event adequate to the emergency,--an\nevent foreshadowed by various recent circumstances, but hitherto\nfloating in his mind only as a possibility. Its occurrence would at once\nchange the course of Elsie's feelings, providing her with something to\nthink of besides mischief, and remove the accursed obstacle which\nwas thwarting all his own projects. Every possible motive, then,--his\ninterest, his jealousy, his longing for revenge, and now his fears for\nhis own safety,--urged him to regard the happening of a certain casualty\nas a matter of simple necessity. This was the self-destruction of Mr.\nBernard Langdon.\n\nSuch an event, though it might be surprising to many people, would not\nbe incredible, nor without many parallel cases. He was poor, a miserable\nfag, under the control of that mean wretch up there at the school, who\nlooked as if he had sour buttermilk in his veins instead of blood. He\nwas in love with a girl above his station, rich, and of old family, but\nstrange in all her ways, and it was conceivable that he should become\nsuddenly jealous of her. Or she might have frightened him with some\ndisplay of her peculiarities which had filled him with a sudden\nrepugnance in the place of love. Any of these things were credible, and\nwould make a probable story enough,--so thought Dick over to himself\nwith the New-England half of his mind.\n\nUnfortunately, men will not always take themselves out of the way when,\nso far as their neighbors are concerned, it would be altogether the most\nappropriate and graceful and acceptable service they could render. There\nwas at this particular moment no special reason for believing that the\nschoolmaster meditated any violence to his own person. On the contrary,\nthere was good evidence that he was taking some care of himself. He was\nlooking well and in good spirits, and in the habit of amusing himself\nand exercising, as if to keep up his standard of health, especially of\ntaking certain evening-walks, before referred to, at an hour when most\nof the Rockland people had \u00e2\u0080\u009cretired,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or, in vulgar language, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgone to\nbed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDick Veneer settled it, however, in his own mind, that Mr. Bernard\nLangdon must lay violent hands upon himself. He even went so far as to\ndetermine the precise hour, and the method in which the \u00e2\u0080\u009crash act,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as\nit would undoubtedly be called in the next issue of \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Rockland Weekly\nUniverse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d should be committed. Time,--this evening. Method, asphyxia,\nby suspension. It was, unquestionably, taking a great liberty with a\nman to decide that he should become felo de se without his own consent.\nSuch, however, was the decision of Mr. Richard Veneer with regard to Mr.\nBernard Langdon.\n\nIf everything went right, then, there would be a coroner's inquest\nto-morrow upon what remained of that gentleman, found suspended to the\nbranch of a tree somewhere within a mile of the Apollinean Institute.\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u009cWeekly Universe\u00e2\u0080\u009d would have a startling paragraph announcing a\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSAD EVENT!!!\u00e2\u0080\u009d which had \u00e2\u0080\u009cthrown the town into an intense state of\nexcitement. Mr. Barnard Langden, a well-known teacher at the Appolinian\nInstitute, was found, etc., etc. The vital spark was extinct. The\nmotive to the rash act can only be conjectured, but is supposed to be\ndisappointed affection. The name of an accomplished young lady of the\nhighest respectability and great beauty is mentioned in connection with\nthis melancholy occurrence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDick Venner was at the tea-table that evening, as usual.--No, he would\ntake green tea, if she pleased,--the same that her father drank. It\nwould suit his headache better.--Nothing,--he was much obliged to her.\nHe would help himself,--which he did in a little different way from\ncommon, naturally enough, on account of his headache. He noticed that\nElsie seemed a little nervous while she was rinsing some of the teacups\nbefore their removal.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere's something going on in that witch's head,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to himself.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know her,--she 'd be savage now, if she had n't got some trick in\nhand. Let 's see how she looks to-morrow!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDick announced that he should go to bed early that evening, on account\nof this confounded headache which had been troubling him so much. In\nfact, he went up early, and locked his door after him, with as much\nnoise as he could make. He then changed some part of his dress, so that\nit should be dark throughout, slipped off his boots, drew the lasso out\nfrom the bottom of the contents of his trunk, and, carrying that and\nhis boots in his hand, opened his door softly, locked it after him, and\nstole down the back-stairs, so as to get out of the house unnoticed. He\nwent straight to the stable and saddled the mustang. He took a rope from\nthe stable with him, mounted his horse, and set forth in the direction\nof the Institute.\n\nMr. Bernard, as we have seen, had not been very profoundly impressed by\nthe old Doctor's cautions,--enough, however, to follow out some of his\nhints which were not troublesome to attend to. He laughed at the idea of\ncarrying a loaded pistol about with him; but still it seemed only fair,\nas the old Doctor thought so much of the matter, to humor him about it.\nAs for not going about when and where he liked, for fear he might have\nsome lurking enemy, that was a thing not to be listened to nor thought\nof. There was nothing to be ashamed of or troubled about in any of\nhis relations with the school-girls. Elsie, no doubt, showed a kind\nof attraction towards him, as did perhaps some others; but he had been\nperfectly discreet, and no father or brother or lover had any just\ncause of quarrel with him. To be sure, that dark young man at the Dudley\nmansion-house looked as if he were his enemy, when he had met him; but\ncertainly there was nothing in their relations to each other, or in\nhis own to Elsie, that would be like to stir such malice in his mind\nas would lead him to play any of his wild Southern tricks at his, Mr.\nBernard's, expense. Yet he had a vague feeling that this young man was\ndangerous, and he had been given to understand that one of the risks he\nran was from that quarter.\n\nOn this particular evening, he had a strange, unusual sense of some\nimpending peril. His recent interview with the Doctor, certain remarks\nwhich had been dropped in his hearing, but above all an unaccountable\nimpression upon his spirits, all combined to fill his mind with a\nforeboding conviction that he was very near some overshadowing danger.\nIt was as the chill of the ice-mountain toward which the ship is\nsteering under full sail. He felt a strong impulse to see Helen Darley\nand talk with her. She was in the common parlor, and, fortunately,\nalone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHelen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,--for they were almost like brother and sister now,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nhave been thinking what you would do, if I should have to leave the\nschool at short notice, or be taken away suddenly by any accident.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, her cheek growing paler than its natural delicate\nhue,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy, I do not know how I could possibly consent to live here, if\nyou left us. Since you came, my life has been almost easy; before, it\nwas getting intolerable. You must not talk about going, my dear friend;\nyou have spoiled me for my place. Who is there here that I can have any\ntrue society with, but you? You would not leave us for another school,\nwould you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, my dear Helen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Bernard said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif it depends on myself, I\nshall stay out my full time, and enjoy your company and friendship. But\neverything is uncertain in this world. I have been thinking that I might\nbe wanted elsewhere, and called when I did not think of it;--it was a\nfancy, perhaps,--but I can't keep it out of my mind this evening. If any\nof my fancies should come true, Helen, there are two or three messages\nI want to leave with you. I have marked a book or two with a cross in\npencil on the fly-leaf;--these are for you. There is a little hymn-book\nI should like to have you give to Elsie from me;--it may be a kind of\ncomfort to the poor girl.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelen's eyes glistened as she interrupted him,--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you mean? You must not talk so, Mr. Langdon. Why, you never\nlooked better in your life. Tell me now, you are not in earnest, are\nyou, but only trying a little sentiment on me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Bernard smiled, but rather sadly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout half in earnest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have had some fancies in my\nhead,--superstitions, I suppose,--at any rate, it does no harm to tell\nyou what I should like to have done, if anything should happen,--very\nlikely nothing ever will. Send the rest of the books home, if you\nplease, and write a letter to my mother. And, Helen, you will find\none small volume in my desk enveloped and directed, you will see to\nwhom;--give this with your own hands; it is a keepsake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe tears gathered in her eyes; she could not speak at first. Presently,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Bernard, my dear friend, my brother, it cannot be that you are in\ndanger? Tell me what it is, and, if I can share it with you, or counsel\nyou in any way, it will only be paying back the great debt I owe you.\nNo, no,--it can't be true,--you are tired and worried, and your spirits\nhave got depressed. I know what that is;--I was sure, one winter, that\nI should die before spring; but I lived to see the dandelions\nand buttercups go to seed. Come, tell me it was nothing but your\nimagination.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe felt a tear upon her cheek, but would not turn her face away from\nhim; it was the tear of a sister.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am really in earnest, Helen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know that there is\nthe least reason in the world for these fancies. If they all go off and\nnothing comes of them, you may laugh at me, if you like. But if there\nshould be any occasion, remember my requests. You don't believe in\npresentiments, do you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, don't ask-me, I beg you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helen answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have had a good many\nfrights for every one real misfortune I have suffered. Sometimes I have\nthought I was warned beforehand of coming trouble, just as many people\nare of changes in the weather, by some unaccountable feeling,--but not\noften, and I don't like to talk about such things. I wouldn't think\nabout these fancies of yours. I don't believe you have exercised\nenough;--don't you think it's confinement in the school has made you\nnervous?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps it has; but it happens that I have thought more of exercise\nlately, and have taken regular evening walks, besides playing my old\ngymnastic tricks every day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey talked on many subjects, but through all he said Helen perceived a\npervading tone of sadness, and an expression as of a dreamy foreboding\nof unknown evil. They parted at the usual hour, and went to their\nseveral rooms. The sadness of Mr. Bernard had sunk into the heart\nof Helen, and she mingled many tears with her prayers that evening,\nearnestly entreating that he might be comforted in his days of trial and\nprotected in his hour of danger.\n\nMr. Bernard stayed in his room a short time before setting out for his\nevening walk. His eye fell upon the Bible his mother had given him when\nhe left home, and he opened it in the New Testament at a venture.\nIt happened that the first words he read were these,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cLest, coming\nsuddenly, he find you sleeping.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In the state of mind in which he was at\nthe moment, the text startled him. It was like a supernatural warning.\nHe was not going to expose himself to any particular danger this\nevening; a walk in a quiet village was as free from risk as Helen Darley\nor his own mother could ask; yet he had an unaccountable feeling of\napprehension, without any definite object. At this moment he remembered\nthe old Doctor's counsel, which he had sometimes neglected, and,\nblushing at the feeling which led him to do it, he took the pistol his\nsuspicious old friend had forced upon him, which he had put away loaded,\nand, thrusting it into his pocket, set out upon his walk.\n\nThe moon was shining at intervals, for the night was partially clouded.\nThere seemed to be nobody stirring, though his attention was unusually\nawake, and he could hear the whirr of the bats overhead, and the\npulsating croak of the frogs in the distant pools and marshes. Presently\nhe detected the sound of hoofs at some distance, and, looking forward,\nsaw a horseman coming in his direction. The moon was under a cloud\nat the moment, and he could only observe that the horse and his rider\nlooked like a single dark object, and that they were moving along at an\neasy pace. Mr. Bernard was really ashamed of himself, when he found his\nhand on the butt of his pistol. When the horseman was within a hundred\nand fifty yards of him, the moon shone out suddenly and revealed each\nof them to the other. The rider paused for a moment, as if carefully\nsurveying the pedestrian, then suddenly put his horse to the full\ngallop, and dashed towards him, rising at the same instant in his\nstirrups and swinging something round his head, what, Mr. Bernard could\nnot make out. It was a strange manoeuvre,--so strange and threatening in\naspect that the young man forgot his nervousness in an instant, cocked\nhis pistol, and waited to see what mischief all this meant. He did not\nwait long. As the rider came rushing towards him, he made a rapid\nmotion and something leaped five-and-twenty feet through the air, in\nMr. Bernard's direction. In an instant he felt a ring, as of a rope or\nthong, settle upon his shoulders. There was no time to think, he would\nbe lost in another second. He raised his pistol and fired,--not at the\nrider, but at the horse. His aim was true; the mustang gave one bound\nand fell lifeless, shot through the head. The lasso was fastened to his\nsaddle, and his last bound threw Mr. Bernard violently to the earth,\nwhere he lay motionless, as if stunned.\n\nIn the mean time, Dick Venner, who had been dashed down with his horse,\nwas trying to extricate himself,--one of his legs being held fast under\nthe animal, the long spur on his boot having caught in the saddle-cloth.\nHe found, however, that he could do nothing with his right arm, his\nshoulder having been in some way injured in his fall. But his Southern\nblood was up, and, as he saw Mr. Bernard move as if he were coming to\nhis senses, he struggled violently to free himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI 'll have the dog, yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,--\u00e2\u0080\u009conly let me get at him with the\nknife!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe had just succeeded in extricating his imprisoned leg, and was ready\nto spring to his feet, when he was caught firmly by the throat, and\nlooking up, saw a clumsy barbed weapon, commonly known as a hay fork,\nwithin an inch of his breast.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHold on there! What 'n thunder 'r' y' abaout, y' darned Portagee?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\na voice, with a decided nasal tone in it, but sharp and resolute.\n\nDick looked from the weapon to the person who held it, and saw a sturdy,\nplain man standing over him, with his teeth clinched, and his aspect\nthat of one all ready for mischief.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLay still, naow!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Abel Stebbins, the Doctor's man; \u00e2\u0080\u009c'f y' don't,\nI'll stick ye, 'z sure 'z y' 'r' alive! I been arfter ye f'r a week,\n'n' I got y' naow! I knowed I'd ketch ye at some darned trick or 'nother\n'fore I'd done 'ith ye!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDick lay perfectly still, feeling that he was crippled and helpless,\nthinking all the time with the Yankee half of his mind what to do about\nit. He saw Mr. Bernard lift his head and look around him. He would\nget his senses again in a few minutes, very probably, and then he, Mr.\nRichard Venner, would be done for.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me up! let me up!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, in a low, hurried voice,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI 'll give\nyou a hundred dollars in gold to let me go. The man a'n't hurt,--don't\nyou see him stirring? He'll come to himself in two minutes. Let me up!\nI'll give you a hundred and fifty dollars in gold, now, here on the\nspot,--and the watch out of my pocket; take it yourself, with your own\nhands!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll see y' darned fust! Ketch me lett'n' go!\u00e2\u0080\u009d was Abel's emphatic\nanswer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYeou lay still, 'n' wait t'll that man comes tew.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe kept the hay-fork ready for action at the slightest sign of\nresistance.\n\nMr. Bernard, in the mean time, had been getting, first his senses, and\nthen some few of his scattered wits, a little together.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d--he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho'shurt? What's happened?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome along here 'z quick 'z y' ken,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Abel answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009c'n' haalp me fix\nthis fellah. Y' been hurt, y'rself, 'n' the' 's murder come pooty nigh\nhappenin'.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Bernard heard the answer, but presently stared about and asked\nagain, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho's hurt? What's happened?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cY' 'r' hurt, y'rself, I tell ye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Abel; \u00e2\u0080\u009c'n' the' 's been a\nmurder, pooty nigh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Bernard felt something about his neck, and, putting his hands up,\nfound the loop of the lasso, which he loosened, but did not think to\nslip over his head, in the confusion of his perceptions and thoughts. It\nwas a wonder that it had not choked him, but he had fallen forward so as\nto slacken it.\n\nBy this time he was getting some notion of what he was about, and\npresently began looking round for his pistol, which had fallen. He\nfound it lying near him, cocked it mechanically, and walked, somewhat\nunsteadily, towards the two men, who were keeping their position as\nstill as if they were performing in a tableau.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuick, naow!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Abel, who had heard the click of cocking the pistol,\nand saw that he held it in his hand, as he came towards him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGi' me\nthat pistil, and yeou fetch that 'ere rope layin' there. I 'll have this\nhere fellah fixed 'n less 'n two minutes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Bernard did as Abel said,--stupidly and mechanically, for he was but\nhalf right as yet. Abel pointed the pistol at Dick's head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNaow hold up y'r hands, yeou fellah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009c'n' keep 'em up, while\nthis man puts the rope mound y'r wrists.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDick felt himself helpless, and, rather than have his disabled arm\nroughly dealt with, held up his hands. Mr. Bernard did as Abel said; he\nwas in a purely passive state, and obeyed orders like a child. Abel then\nsecured the rope in a most thorough and satisfactory complication of\ntwists and knots.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNaow get up, will ye?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; and the unfortunate Dick rose to his\nfeet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho's hurt? What's happened?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked poor Mr. Bernard again, his memory\nhaving been completely jarred out of him for the time.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, look here naow, yeou, don' Stan' askin' questions over 'n'\nover;--'t beats all! ha'n't I tol' y' a dozen times?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs Abel spoke, he turned and looked at Mr. Bernard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHullo! What 'n thunder's that 'ere raoun' y'r neck? Ketched ye 'ith a\nslippernoose, hey? Wal, if that a'n't the craowner! Hol' on a minute,\nCap'n, 'n' I'll show ye what that 'ere halter's good for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAbel slipped the noose over Mr. Bernard's head, and put it round\nthe neck of the miserable Dick Veneer, who made no sign of\nresistance,--whether on account of the pain he was in, or from mere\nhelplessness, or because he was waiting for some unguarded moment to\nescape,--since resistance seemed of no use.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI 'm go'n' to kerry y' home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Abel; \u00e2\u0080\u009c'T' th' ol Doctor, he's got\na gre't cur'osity t' see ye. Jes' step along naow,--off that way, will\nye?--'n' I Ill hol' on t' th' bridle, f' fear y' sh'd run away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe took hold of the leather thong, but found that it was fastened at the\nother end to the saddle. This was too much for Abel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWal, naow, yeou be a pooty chap to hev raound! A fellah's neck in a\nslippernoose at one eend of a halter, 'n' a hors on th' full spring at\nt' other eend!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked at him from' head to foot as a naturalist inspects a new\nspecimen. His clothes had suffered in his fall, especially on the leg\nwhich had been caught under the horse.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHullo! look o' there, naow! What's that 'ere stickin' aout o' y'r\nboot?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was nothing but the handle of an ugly knife, which Abel instantly\nrelieved him of.\n\nThe party now took up the line of march for old Doctor Kittredge's\nhouse, Abel carrying the pistol and knife, and Mr. Bernard walking in\nsilence, still half-stunned, holding the hay-fork, which Abel had thrust\ninto his hand. It was all a dream to him as yet. He remembered the\nhorseman riding at him, and his firing the pistol; but whether he was\nalive, and these walls around him belonged to the village of Rockland,\nor whether he had passed the dark river, and was in a suburb of the New\nJerusalem, he could not as yet have told.\n\nThey were in the street where the Doctor's house was situated.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess I'll fire off one o' these here berrils,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Abel.\n\nHe fired.\n\nPresently there was a noise of opening windows, and the nocturnal\nhead-dresses of Rockland flowered out of them like so many developments\nof the Nightblooming Cereus. White cotton caps and red bandanna\nhandkerchiefs were the prevailing forms of efflorescence. The main point\nwas that the village was waked up. The old Doctor always waked easily,\nfrom long habit, and was the first among those who looked out to see\nwhat had happened.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Abel!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he called out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat have you got there? and what 's all\nthis noise about?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe've ketched the Portagee!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Abel answered, as laconically as the hero\nof Lake Erie, in his famous dispatch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo in there, you fellah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe prisoner was marched into the house, and the Doctor, who had\nbewitched his clothes upon him in a way that would have been miraculous\nin anybody but a physician, was down in presentable form as soon as if\nit had been a child in a fit that he was sent for.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRichard Veneer!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor exclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the meaning of all\nthis? Mr. Langdon, has anything happened to you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Bernard put his hand to his head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy mind is confused,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI've had a fall.--Oh, yes!--wait a\nminute and it will all come back to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSit down, sit down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbel will tell me about it.\nSlight concussion of the brain. Can't remember very well for an hour or\ntwo,--will come right by to-morrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeen stunded,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Abel said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe can't tell nothin'.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAbel then proceeded to give a Napoleonic bulletin of the recent combat\nof cavalry and infantry and its results,--none slain, one captured.\n\nThe Doctor looked at the prisoner through his spectacles.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat 's the matter with your shoulder, Venner?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDick answered sullenly, that he didn't know, fell on it when his horse\ncame down. The Doctor examined it as carefully as he could through his\nclothes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOut of joint. Untie his hands, Abel\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBy this time a small alarm had spread among the neighbors, and there was\na circle around Dick, who glared about on the assembled honest people\nlike a hawk with a broken wing.\n\nWhen the Doctor said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cUntie his hands,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the circle widened perceptibly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIsn't it a leetle rash to give him the use of his hands? I see there's\nfemales and children standin' near.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was the remark of our old friend, Deacon Soper, who retired from\nthe front row, as he spoke, behind a respectable-looking, but somewhat\nhastily dressed person of the defenceless sex, the female help of a\nneighboring household, accompanied by a boy, whose unsmoothed shock of\nhair looked like a last year's crow's-nest.\n\nBut Abel untied his hands, in spite of the Deacon's considerate\nremonstrance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe first thing is to put the joint back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStop,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Deacon Soper,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cstop a minute. Don't you think it will be\nsafer--for the women-folks--jest to wait till mornin', afore you put\nthat j'int into the socket?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nColonel Sprowle, who had been called by a special messenger, spoke up at\nthis moment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet the women-folks and the deacons go home, if they're scared, and put\nthe fellah's j'int in as quick as you like. I 'll resk him, j'int in or\nout.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI want one of you to go straight down to Dudley Venner's with a\nmessage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will have the young man's shoulder in\nquick enough.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon't send that message!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dick, in a hoarse voice;--\u00e2\u0080\u009cdo what you\nlike with my arm, but don't send that message! Let me go,--I can walk,\nand I'll be off from this place. There's nobody hurt but myself. Damn\nthe shoulder!--let me go! You shall never hear of me again!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Bernard came forward.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy friends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not injured,--seriously, at least. Nobody\nneed complain against this man, if I don't. The Doctor will treat him\nlike a human being, at any rate; and then, if he will go, let him. There\nare too many witnesses against him here for him to want to stay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor, in the mean time, without saying a word to all this, had got\na towel round the shoulder and chest and another round the arm, and had\nthe bone replaced in a very few minutes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbel, put Cassia into the new chaise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, quietly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy friends\nand neighbors, leave this young man to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cColonel Sprowle, you're a justice of the peace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Deacon Soper,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand you know what the law says in cases like this. It a'n't so clear\nthat it won't have to come afore the Grand Jury, whether we will or no.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess we'll set that j'int to-morrow mornin',\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Colonel\nSprowle,--which made a laugh at the Deacon's expense, and virtually\nsettled the question.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow trust this young man in my care,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand go home\nand finish your naps. I knew him when he was a boy and I'll answer for\nit, he won't trouble you any more. The Dudley blood makes folks proud, I\ncan tell you, whatever else they are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe good people so respected and believed in the Doctor that they left\nthe prisoner with him.\n\nPresently, Cassia, the fast Morgan mare, came up to the front-door,\nwith the wheels of the new, light chaise flashing behind her in the\nmoonlight. The Doctor drove Dick forty miles at a stretch that night,\nout of the limits of the State.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you want money?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, before he left him.\n\nDick told him the secret of his golden belt.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere shall I send your trunk after you from your uncle's?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDick gave him a direction to a seaport town to which he himself was\ngoing, to take passage for a port in South America.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-bye, Richard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTry to learn something from\nto-night's lesson.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Southern impulses in Dick's wild blood overcame him, and he kissed\nthe old Doctor on both cheeks, crying as only the children of the sun\ncan cry, after the first hours in the dewy morning of life. So Dick\nVenner disappears from this story. An hour after dawn, Cassia pointed\nher fine ears homeward, and struck into her square, honest trot, as\nif she had not been doing anything more than her duty during her four\nhours' stretch of the last night.\n\nAbel was not in the habit of questioning the Doctor's decisions.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's all right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to Mr. Bernard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fellah 's Squire Venner's\nrelation, anyhaow. Don't you want to wait here, jest a little while,\ntill I come back? The's a consid'able nice saddle 'n' bridle on a dead\nboss that's layin' daown there in the road 'n' I guess the' a'n't no use\nin lettin' on 'em spite,--so I'll jest step aout 'n' fetch 'em along. I\nkind o' calc'late 't won't pay to take the cretur's shoes 'n' hide off\nto-night,--'n' the' won't be much iron on that hose's huffs an haour\nafter daylight, I'll bate ye a quarter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll walk along with you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Bernard; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel as if I could get\nalong well enough now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo they set off together. There was a little crowd round the dead\nmustang already, principally consisting of neighbors who had adjourned\nfrom the Doctor's house to see the scene of the late adventure. In\naddition to these, however, the assembly was honored by the presence of\nMr. Principal Silas Peckham, who had been called from his slumbers by\na message that Master Langdon was shot through the head by a\nhighway-robber, but had learned a true version of the story by this\ntime. His voice was at that moment heard above the rest,--sharp, but\nthin, like bad cider-vinegar.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI take charge of that property, I say. Master Langdon 's actin' under\nmy orders, and I claim that hoss and all that's on him. Hiram! jest slip\noff that saddle and bridle, and carry 'em up to the Institoot, and bring\ndown a pair of pinchers and a file,--and--stop--fetch a pair of shears,\ntoo; there's hosshair enough in that mane and tail to stuff a bolster\nwith.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou let that hoss alone!\u00e2\u0080\u009d spoke up Colonel Sprowle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen a fellah\ngoes out huntin' and shoots a squirrel, do you think he's go'n' to\nlet another fellah pick him up and kerry him off? Not if he's got a\ndouble-berril gun, and t'other berril ha'n't been fired off yet! I\nshould like to see the mahn that'll take off that seddle 'n' bridle,\nexcep' the one th't hez a fair right to the whole concern!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHiram was from one of the lean streaks in New Hampshire, and, not being\noverfed in Mr. Silas Peckham's kitchen, was somewhat wanting in stamina,\nas well as in stomach, for so doubtful an enterprise, as undertaking to\ncarry out his employer's orders in the face of the Colonel's defiance.\n\nJust then Mr. Bernard and Abel came up together. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere they be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthe Colonel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cStan' beck, gentlemen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Bernard, who was pale and still a little confused, but gradually\nbecoming more like himself, stood and looked in silence for a moment.\n\nAll his thoughts seemed to be clearing themselves in this interval.\nHe took in the whole series of incidents: his own frightful risk; the\nstrange, instinctive, nay, Providential impulse, which had led him so\nsuddenly to do the one only thing which could possibly have saved him;\nthe sudden appearance of the Doctor's man, but for which he might yet\nhave been lost; and the discomfiture and capture of his dangerous enemy.\n\nIt was all past now, and a feeling of pity rose in Mr. Bernard's heart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe loved that horse, no doubt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cand no wonder. A beautiful,\nwild--looking creature! Take off those things that are on him, Abel, and\nhave them carried to Mr. Dudley Veneer's. If he does not want them, you\nmay keep them yourself, for all that I have to say. One thing more. I\nhope nobody will lift his hand against this noble creature to mutilate\nhim in any way. After you have taken off the saddle and bridle, Abel,\nbury him just as he is. Under that old beech-tree will be a good place.\nYou'll see to it,--won't you, Abel?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAbel nodded assent, and Mr. Bernard returned to the Institute, threw\nhimself in his clothes on the bed, and slept like one who is heavy with\nwine.\n\nFollowing Mr. Bernard's wishes, Abel at once took off the high-peaked\nsaddle and the richly ornamented bridle from the mustang. Then, with\nthe aid of two or three others, he removed him to the place indicated.\nSpades and shovels were soon procured, and before the moon had set, the\nwild horse of the Pampas was at rest under the turf at the wayside, in\nthe far village among the hills of New England.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI. THE NEWS REACHES THE DUDLEY MANSION.\n\nEarly the next morning Abel Stebbins made his appearance at Dudley\nVeneer's, and requested to see the maan o' the haouse abaout somethin'\no' consequence. Mr. Veneer sent word that the messenger should wait\nbelow, and presently appeared in the study, where Abel was making\nhimself at home, as is the wont of the republican citizen, when he hides\nthe purple of empire beneath the apron of domestic service.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood mornin', Squire!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Abel, as Mr. Venner entered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy name's\nStebbins, 'n' I'm stoppin' f'r a spell 'ith of Doctor Kittredge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Stebbins,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Dudley Veneer, \u00e2\u0080\u009chave you brought any special\nmessage from the Doctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cY' ha'n't heerd nothin' abaout it, Squire, d' ye mean t' say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nAbel,--beginning to suspect that he was the first to bring the news of\nlast evening's events.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Mr. Veneer, with some interest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDew tell, naow! Waal, that beats all! Why, that 'ere Portagee relation\no' yourn 'z been tryin' t' ketch a fellah 'n a slippernoose, 'n' got\nketched himself,--that's all. Y' ha'n't heerd noth'n' abaout it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSit down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Dudley Veneer, calmly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand tell me all you have to\nsay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo Abel sat down and gave him an account of the events of the last\nevening. It was a strange and terrible surprise to Dudley Veneer to find\nthat his nephew, who had been an inmate of his house and the companion\nof his daughter, was to all intents and purposes guilty of the gravest\nof crimes. But the first shock was no sooner over than he began to think\nwhat effect the news would have on Elsie. He imagined that there was a\nkind of friendly feeling between them, and he feared some crisis would\nbe provoked in his daughter's mental condition by the discovery. He\nwould wait, however, until she came from her chamber, before disturbing\nher with the evil tidings.\n\nAbel did not forget his message with reference to the equipments of the\ndead mustang.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe' was some things on the hoss, Squire, that the man he ketched\nsaid he did n' care no gre't abaout; but perhaps you'd like to have 'em\nfetched to the mansion-haouse. Ef y' did n' care abaout 'em, though,\nI should n' min' keepin' on 'em; they might come handy some time or\n'nother; they say, holt on t' anything for ten year 'n' there 'll be\nsome kin' o' use for 't.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKeep everything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dudley Veneer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't want to see anything\nbelonging to that young man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo Abel nodded to Mr. Veneer, and left the study to find some of the men\nabout the stable to tell and talk over with them the events of the\nlast evening. He presently came upon Elbridge, chief of the equine\ndepartment, and driver of the family-coach.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood mornin', Abe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Elbridge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat's fetched y' daown here so\nall-fired airly?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou're a darned pooty lot daown here, you be!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAbel answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBetter keep your Portagees t' home nex' time, ketchin'\nfolks 'ith slippernooses raoun' their necks, 'n' kerryin' knives 'n\ntheir boots!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat 'r' you jawin' abaout?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Elbridge said, looking up to see if he was\nin earnest, and what he meant.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJawin' abaout? You'll find aout'z soon 'z y' go into that 'ere stable\no' yourn! Y' won't curry that 'ere long-tailed black hoss no more; 'n'\ny' won't set y'r eyes on the fellah that rid him, ag'in, in a hurry!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nElbridge walked straight to the stable, without saying a word, found the\ndoor unlocked, and went in.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTh' critter's gone, sure enough!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGlad on 't! The darndest,\nkickin'est, bitin'est beast th't ever I see, 'r ever wan' t' see ag'in!\nGood reddance! Don' wan' no snappin'-turkles in my stable! Whar's the\nman gone th't brought the critter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhar he's gone? Guess y' better go 'n ask my ol man; he kerried him off\nlass' night; 'n' when he comes back, mebbe he 'll tell ye whar he's gone\ntew!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBy this time Elbridge had found out that Abel was in earnest, and had\nsomething to tell. He looked at the litter in the mustang's stall, then\nat the crib.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHa'n't eat b't haalf his feed. Ha'n't been daown on his straw. Must ha'\nbeen took aout somewhere abaout ten 'r 'levee o'clock. I know that 'ere\ncritter's ways. The fellah's had him aout nights afore; b't I never\nthought nothin' o' no mischief. He 's a kin' o' haalf Injin. What is 't\nthe chap's been a-doin' on? Tell 's all abaout it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAbel sat down on a meal-chest, picked up a straw and put it into his\nmouth. Elbridge sat down at the other end, pulled out his jack-knife,\nopened the penknife-blade, and began sticking it into the lid of the\nmeal-chest. The Doctor's man had a story to tell, and he meant to\nget all the enjoyment out of it. So he told it with every luxury of\ncircumstance. Mr. Veneer's man heard it all with open mouth. No listener\nin the gardens of Stamboul could have found more rapture in a tale heard\namidst the perfume of roses and the voices of birds and tinkling of\nfountains than Elbridge in following Abel's narrative, as they sat there\nin the aromatic ammoniacal atmosphere of the stable, the grinding of\nthe horses' jaws keeping evenly on through it all, with now and then the\ninterruption of a stamping hoof, and at intervals a ringing crow from\nthe barn-yard.\n\nElbridge stopped a minute to think, after Abel had finished.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho's took care o' them things that was on the hoss?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, gravely.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWaal, Langden, he seemed to kin 'o' think I'd ought to have 'em,--'n'\nthe Squire; he did n' seem to have no 'bjection; 'n' so,--waal, I\ncalc'late I sh'll jes' holt on to 'em myself; they a'n't good f 'r much,\nbut they're cur'ous t' keep t' look at.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Veneer's man did not appear much gratified by this arrangement,\nespecially as he had a shrewd suspicion that some of the ornaments of\nthe bridle were of precious metal, having made occasional examinations\nof them with the edge of a file. But he did not see exactly what to do\nabout it, except to get them from Abel in the way of bargain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWaal, no,--they a'n't good for much 'xcep' to look at. 'F y' ever rid\non that seddle once, y' would n' try it ag'in, very spry,--not 'f y' c'd\nhaalp y'rsaalf.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI tried it,--darned 'f I sot daown f'r th' nex' week,--eat all my\nvictuals stan'in'. I sh'd like t' hev them things wal enough to heng up\n'n the stable; 'f y' want t' trade some day, fetch 'em along daown.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAbel rather expected that Elbridge would have laid claim to the saddle\nand bridle on the strength of some promise or other presumptive title,\nand thought himself lucky to get off with only offering to think abaout\ntradin'.\n\nWhen Elbridge returned to the house, he found the family in a state of\ngreat excitement. Mr. Venner had told Old Sophy, and she had informed\nthe other servants. Everybody knew what had happened, excepting Elsie.\nHer father had charged them all to say nothing about it to her; he would\ntell her, when she came down.\n\nHe heard her step at last,--alight, gliding step,--so light that her\ncoming was often unheard, except by those who perceived the faint rustle\nthat went with it. She was paler than common this morning, as she came\ninto her father's study.\n\nAfter a few words of salutation, he said quietly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cElsie, my dear, your\ncousin Richard has left us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe grew still paler, as she asked,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs he dead?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDudley Venner started to see the expression with which Elsie put this\nquestion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is living,--but dead to us from this day forward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said her father.\n\nHe proceeded to tell her, in a general way, the story he had just heard\nfrom Abel. There could be no doubting it;--he remembered him as the\nDoctor's man; and as Abel had seen all with his own eyes, as Dick's\nchamber, when unlocked with a spare key, was found empty, and his bed\nhad not been slept in, he accepted the whole account as true.\n\nWhen he told of Dick's attempt on the young schoolmaster, (\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know\nMr. Langdon very well, Elsie,--a perfectly inoffensive young man, as I\nunderstand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d) Elsie turned her face away and slid along by the wall\nto the window which looked out oh the little grass-plot with the white\nstone standing in it. Her father could not see her face, but he knew\nby her movements that her dangerous mood was on her. When she heard the\nsequel of the story, the discomfiture and capture of Dick, she turned\nround for an instant, with a look of contempt and of something like\ntriumph upon her face. Her father saw that her cousin had become\nodious to her: He knew well, by every change of her countenance, by\nher movements, by every varying curve of her graceful figure, the\ntransitions front passion to repose, from fierce excitement to the dull\nlanguor which often succeeded her threatening paroxysms.\n\nShe remained looking out at the window. A group of white fan-tailed\npigeons had lighted on the green plot before it and clustered about one\nof their companions who lay on his back, fluttering in a strange way,\nwith outspread wings and twitching feet. Elsie uttered a faint cry;\nthese were her special favorites and often fed from her hand. She threw\nopen the long window, sprang out, caught up the white fantail, and held\nit to her bosom. The bird stretched himself out, and then lay still,\nwith open eyes, lifeless. She looked at him a moment, and, sliding in\nthrough the open window and through the study, sought her own apartment,\nwhere she locked herself in, and began to sob and moan like those that\nweep. But the gracious solace of tears seemed to be denied her, and her\ngrief, like her anger, was a dull ache, longing, like that, to finish\nitself with a fierce paroxysm, but wanting its natural outlet.\n\nThis seemingly trifling incident of the death of her favorite appeared\nto change all the current of her thought. Whether it were the sight\nof the dying bird, or the thought that her own agency might have beep\nconcerned in it, or some deeper grief, which took this occasion to\ndeclare itself,--some dark remorse or hopeless longing,--whatever it\nmight be, there was an unwonted tumult in her soul. To whom should\nshe go in her vague misery? Only to Him who knows all His creatures'\nsorrows, and listens to the faintest human cry. She knelt, as she had\nbeen taught to kneel from her childhood, and tried to pray. But her\nthoughts refused to flow in the language of supplication. She could not\nplead for herself as other women plead in their hours of anguish. She\nrose like one who should stoop to drink, and find dust in the place of\nwater. Partly from restlessness, partly from an attraction she hardly\navowed to herself, she followed her usual habit and strolled listlessly\nalong to the school.\n\nOf course everybody at the Institute was full of the terrible adventure\nof the preceding evening. Mr. Bernard felt poorly enough; but he had\nmade it a point to show himself the next morning, as if nothing had\nhappened. Helen Darley knew nothing of it all until she hard risen, when\nthe gossipy matron of the establishment made her acquainted with all its\ndetails, embellished with such additional ornamental appendages as\nit had caught up in transmission from lip to lip. She did not love to\nbetray her sensibilities, but she was pale and tremulous and very\nnearly tearful when Mr. Bernard entered the sitting-room, showing on\nhis features traces of the violent shock he had received and the heavy\nslumber from which he had risen with throbbing brows. What the poor\ngirl's impulse was, on seeing him, we need not inquire too curiously. If\nhe had been her own brother, she would have kissed him and cried on\nhis neck; but something held her back. There is no galvanism in\nkiss-your-brother; it is copper against copper: but alien bloods develop\nstrange currents, when they flow close to each other, with only the\nfilms that cover lip and cheek between them. Mr. Bernard, as some of us\nmay remember, violated the proprieties and laid himself open to reproach\nby his enterprise with a bouncing village-girl, to whose rosy cheek an\nhonest smack was not probably an absolute novelty. He made it all up by\nhis discretion and good behavior now. He saw by Helen's moist eye and\ntrembling lip that her woman's heart was off its guard, and he knew,\nby the infallible instinct of sex, that he should be forgiven, if\nhe thanked her for her sisterly sympathies in the most natural\nway,--expressive, and at the same time economical of breath and\nutterance. He would not give a false look to their friendship by any\nsuch demonstration. Helen was a little older than himself, but the\naureole of young womanhood had not yet begun to fade from around her.\nShe was surrounded by that enchanted atmosphere into which the girl\nwalks with dreamy eyes, and out of which the woman passes with a\nstory written on her forehead. Some people think very little of these\nrefinements; they have not studied magnetism and the law of the square\nof the distance.\n\nSo Mr. Bernard thanked Helen for her interest without the aid of the\ntwenty-seventh letter of the alphabet,--the love labial,--the limping\nconsonant which it takes two to speak plain. Indeed, he scarcely let her\nsay a word, at first; for he saw that it was hard for her to conceal her\nemotion. No wonder; he had come within a hair's-breadth of losing his\nlife, and he had been a very kind friend and a very dear companion to\nher.\n\nThere were some curious spiritual experiences connected with his last\nevening's adventure which were working very strongly in his mind. It was\nborne in upon him irresistibly that he had been dead since he had seen\nHelen,--as dead as the son of the Widow of Nain before the bier was\ntouched and he sat up and began to speak. There was an interval\nbetween two conscious moments which appeared to him like a temporary\nannihilation, and the thoughts it suggested were worrying him with\nstrange perplexities.\n\nHe remembered seeing the dark figure on horseback rise in the saddle and\nsomething leap from its hand. He remembered the thrill he felt as the\ncoil settled on his shoulders, and the sudden impulse which led him to\nfire as he did. With the report of the pistol all became blank, until\nhe found himself in a strange, bewildered state, groping about for\nthe weapon, which he had a vague consciousness of having dropped. But,\naccording to Abel's account, there must have been an interval of some\nminutes between these recollections, and he could not help asking, Where\nwas the mind, the soul, the thinking principle, all this time?\n\nA man is stunned by a blow with a stick on the head. He becomes\nunconscious. Another man gets a harder blow on the head from a bigger\nstick, and it kills him. Does he become unconscious, too? If so, when\ndoes he come to his consciousness? The man who has had a slight or\nmoderate blow comes to himself when the immediate shock passes off and\nthe organs begin to work again, or when a bit of the skull is pried up,\nif that happens to be broken. Suppose the blow is hard enough to spoil\nthe brain and stop the play of the organs, what happens them?\n\nA British captain was struck by a cannon-ball on the head, just as\nhe was giving an order, at the Battle of the Nile. Fifteen months\nafterwards he was trephined at Greenwich Hospital, having been\ninsensible all that time. Immediately after the operation his\nconsciousness returned, and he at once began carrying out the order\nhe was giving when the shot struck him. Suppose he had never been\ntrephined, when would his consciousness have returned? When his breath\nceased and his heart stopped beating?\n\nWhen Mr. Bernard said to Helen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been dead since I saw you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it\nstartled her not a little; for his expression was that of perfect good\nfaith, and she feared that his mind was disordered. When he explained,\nnot as has been done just now, at length, but in a hurried, imperfect\nway, the meaning of his strange assertion, and the fearful Sadduceeisms\nwhich it had suggested to his mind, she looked troubled at first, and\nthen thoughtful. She did not feel able to answer all the difficulties he\nraised, but she met them with that faith which is the strength as well\nas the weakness of women,--which makes them weak in the hands of man,\nbut strong in the presence of the Unseen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a strange experience,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I once had something like\nit. I fainted, and lost some five or ten minutes out of my life, as much\nas if I had been dead. But when I came to myself, I was the same person\nevery way, in my recollections and character. So I suppose that loss\nof consciousness is not death. And if I was born out of unconsciousness\ninto infancy with many family-traits of mind and body, I can believe,\nfrom my own reason, even without help from Revelation, that I shall be\nborn again out of the unconsciousness of death with my individual\ntraits of mind and body. If death is, as it should seem to be, a loss of\nconsciousness, that does not shake my faith; for I have been put into\na body once already to fit me for living here, and I hope to be in some\nway fitted after this life to enjoy a better one. But it is all trust in\nGod and in his Word. These are enough for me; I hope they are for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelen was a minister's daughter, and familiar from her childhood with\nthis class of questions, especially with all the doubts and perplexities\nwhich are sure to assail every thinking child bred in any inorganic\nor not thoroughly vitalized faith,--as is too often the case with the\nchildren of professional theologians. The kind of discipline they are\nsubjected to is like that of the Flat-Head Indian pappooses. At five or\nten or fifteen years old they put their hands up to their foreheads and\nask, What are they strapping down my brains in this way for? So they\ntear off the sacred bandages of the great Flat-Head tribe, and there\nfollows a mighty rush of blood to the long-compressed region. This\naccounts, in the most lucid manner, for those sudden freaks with which\ncertain children of this class astonish their worthy parents at the\nperiod of life when they are growing fast, and, the frontal pressure\nbeginning to be felt as something intolerable, they tear off the holy\ncompresses.\n\nThe hour for school came, and they went to the great hall for study.\nIt would not have occurred to Mr. Silas Peckham to ask his assistant\nwhether he felt well enough to attend to his duties; and Mr. Bernard\nchose to be at his post. A little headache and confusion were all that\nremained of his symptoms.\n\nLater, in the course of the forenoon, Elsie Venner came and took her\nplace. The girls all stared at her--naturally enough; for it was hardly\nto have been expected that she would show herself, after such an event\nin the household to which she belonged. Her expression was somewhat\npeculiar, and, of course, was attributed to the shock her feelings had\nundergone on hearing of the crime attempted by her cousin and daily\ncompanion. When she was looking on her book, or on any indifferent\nobject, her countenance betrayed some inward disturbance, which knitted\nher dark brows, and seemed to throw a deeper shadow over her features.\nBut, from time to time, she would lift her eyes toward Mr. Bernard, and\nlet them rest upon him, without a thought, seemingly, that she herself\nwas the subject of observation or remark. Then they seemed to lose their\ncold glitter, and soften into a strange, dreamy tenderness. The deep\ninstincts of womanhood were striving to grope their way to the surface\nof her being through all the alien influences which overlaid them.\nShe could be secret and cunning in working out any of her dangerous\nimpulses, but she did not know how to mask the unwonted feeling which\nfixed her eyes and her thoughts upon the only person who had ever\nreached the spring of her hidden sympathies.\n\nThe girls all looked at Elsie, whenever they could steal a glance\nunperceived, and many of them were struck with this singular expression\nher features wore. They had long whispered it around among each other\nthat she had a liking for the master; but there were too many of them of\nwhom something like this could be said, to make it very remarkable. Now,\nhowever, when so many little hearts were fluttering at the thought\nof the peril through which the handsome young master had so recently\npassed, they were more alive than ever to the supposed relation between\nhim and the dark school-girl. Some had supposed there was a mutual\nattachment between them; there was a story that they were secretly\nbetrothed, in accordance with the rumor which had been current in the\nvillage. At any rate, some conflict was going on in that still, remote,\nclouded soul, and all the girls who looked upon her face were impressed\nand awed as they had never been before by the shadows that passed over\nit.\n\nOne of these girls was more strongly arrested by Elsie's look than the\nothers. This was a delicate, pallid creature, with a high forehead, and\nwide-open pupils, which looked as if they could take in all the shapes\nthat flit in what, to common eyes, is darkness,--a girl said to be\nclairvoyant under certain influences. In the recess, as it was called,\nor interval of suspended studies in the middle of the forenoon, this\ngirl carried her autograph-book,--for she had one of those indispensable\nappendages of the boarding-school miss of every degree,--and asked Elsie\nto write her name in it. She had an irresistible feeling, that, sooner\nor later, and perhaps very soon, there would attach an unusual interest\nto this autograph. Elsie took the pen and wrote, in her sharp Italian\nhand,\n\nElsie Venner, Infelix.\n\nIt was a remembrance, doubtless, of the forlorn queen of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAEneid\u00e2\u0080\u009d;\nbut its coming to her thought in this way confirmed the sensitive\nschool-girl in her fears for Elsie, and she let fall a tear upon the\npage before she closed it.\n\nOf course, the keen and practised observation of Helen Darley could not\nfail to notice the change of Elsie's manner and expression. She had long\nseen that she was attracted to the young master, and had thought, as\nthe old Doctor did, that any impression which acted upon her affections\nmight be the means of awakening a new life in her singularly isolated\nnature. Now, however, the concentration of the poor girl's thoughts upon\nthe one object which had had power to reach her deeper sensibilities\nwas so painfully revealed in her features, that Helen began to fear\nonce more, lest Mr. Bernard, in escaping the treacherous violence of\nan assassin, had been left to the equally dangerous consequences of a\nviolent, engrossing passion in the breast of a young creature whose love\nit would be ruin to admit and might be deadly to reject. She knew her\nown heart too well to fear that any jealousy might mingle with her new\napprehensions. It was understood between Bernard and Helen that they\nwere too good friends to tamper with the silences and edging proximities\nof lovemaking. She knew, too, the simply human, not masculine, interest\nwhich Mr. Bernard took in Elsie; he had been frank with Helen, and more\nthan satisfied her that with all the pity and sympathy which overflowed\nhis soul, when he thought of the stricken girl, there mingled not one\ndrop of such love as a youth may feel for a maiden.\n\nIt may help the reader to gain some understanding of the anomalous\nnature of Elsie Veneer, if we look with Helen into Mr. Bernard's\nopinions and feelings with reference to her, as they had shaped\nthemselves in his consciousness at the period of which we are speaking.\n\nAt first he had been impressed by her wild beauty, and the contrast of\nall her looks and ways with those of the girls around her. Presently\na sense of some ill-defined personal element, which half-attracted and\nhalf-repelled those who looked upon her, and especially those on whom\nshe looked, began to make itself obvious to him, as he soon found it was\npainfully sensible to his more susceptible companion, the lady-teacher.\nIt was not merely in the cold light of her diamond eyes, but in all her\nmovements, in her graceful postures as she sat, in her costume, and, he\nsometimes thought, even in her speech, that this obscure and exceptional\ncharacter betrayed itself. When Helen had said, that, if they were\nliving in times when human beings were subject to possession, she should\nhave thought there was something not human about Elsie, it struck an\nunsuspected vein of thought in his own mind, which he hated to put in\nwords, but which was continually trying to articulate itself among the\ndumb thoughts which lie under the perpetual stream of mental whispers.\n\nMr. Bernard's professional training had made him slow to accept\nmarvellous stories and many forms of superstition. Yet, as a man of\nscience, he well knew that just on the verge of the demonstrable facts\nof physics and physiology there is a nebulous border-land which what\nis called \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommon sense\u00e2\u0080\u009d perhaps does wisely not to enter, but which\nuncommon sense, or the fine apprehension of privileged intelligences,\nmay cautiously explore, and in so doing find itself behind the scenes\nwhich make up for the gazing world the show which is called Nature.\n\nIt was with something of this finer perception, perhaps with some degree\nof imaginative exaltation, that he set himself to solving the problem\nof Elsie's influence to attract and repel those around her. His letter\nalready submitted to the reader hints in what direction his thoughts\nwere disposed to turn. Here was a magnificent organization, superb\nin vigorous womanhood, with a beauty such as never comes but after\ngenerations of culture; yet through all this rich nature there ran some\nalien current of influence, sinuous and dark, as when a clouded streak\nseams the white marble of a perfect statue.\n\nIt would be needless to repeat the particular suggestions which had come\ninto his mind, as they must probably have come into that of the reader\nwho has noted the singularities of Elsie's tastes and personal traits.\nThe images which certain poets had dreamed of seemed to have become a\nreality before his own eyes. Then came that unexplained adventure of The\nMountain,--almost like a dream in recollection, yet assuredly real in\nsome of its main incidents,--with all that it revealed or hinted. This\ngirl did not fear to visit the dreaded region, where danger lurked in\nevery nook and beneath every tuft of leaves. Did the tenants of the\nfatal ledge recognize some mysterious affinity which made them tributary\nto the cold glitter of her diamond eyes? Was she from her birth one of\nthose frightful children, such as he had read about, and the Professor\nhad told him of, who form unnatural friendships with cold, writhing\nophidians? There was no need of so unwelcome a thought as this; she had\ndrawn him away from the dark opening in the rock at the moment when he\nseemed to be threatened by one of its malignant denizens; that was all\nhe could be sure of; the counter-fascination might have been a dream, a\nfancy, a coincidence. All wonderful things soon grow doubtful in our own\nminds, as do even common events, if great interests prove suddenly to\nattach to their truth or falsehood.\n\n--I, who am telling of these occurrences, saw a friend in the great\ncity, on the morning of a most memorable disaster, hours after the\ntime when the train which carried its victims to their doom had left.\nI talked with him, and was for some minutes, at least, in his company.\nWhen I reached home, I found that the story had gone before that he was\namong the lost, and I alone could contradict it to his weeping friends\nand relatives. I did contradict it; but, alas! I began soon to doubt\nmyself, penetrated by the contagion of their solicitude; my recollection\nbegan to question itself; the order of events became dislocated; and\nwhen I heard that he had reached home in safety, the relief was almost\nas great to me as to those who had expected to see their own brother's\nface no more.\n\nMr. Bernard was disposed, then, not to accept the thought of any odious\npersonal relationship of the kind which had suggested itself to him\nwhen he wrote the letter referred to. That the girl had something of the\nferal nature, her wild, lawless rambles in forbidden and blasted regions\nof The Mountain at all hours, her familiarity with the lonely haunts\nwhere any other human foot was so rarely seen, proved clearly enough.\nBut the more he thought of all her strange instincts and modes of being,\nthe more he became convinced that whatever alien impulse swayed her will\nand modulated or diverted or displaced her affections came from some\nimpression that reached far back into the past, before the days when the\nfaithful Old Sophy had rocked her in the cradle. He believed that she\nhad brought her ruling tendency, whatever it was, into the world with\nher.\n\nWhen the school was over and the girls had all gone, Helen lingered in\nthe schoolroom to speak with Mr. Bernard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you remark Elsie's ways this forenoon?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, not particularly; I have not noticed anything as sharply as I\ncommonly do; my head has been a little queer, and I have been thinking\nover what we were talking about, and how near I came to solving the\ngreat problem which every day makes clear to such multitudes of people.\nWhat about Elsie?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBernard, her liking for you is growing into a passion. I have studied\ngirls for a long while, and I know the difference between their passing\nfancies and their real emotions. I told you, you remember, that Rosa\nwould have to leave us; we barely missed a scene, I think, if not a\nwhole tragedy, by her going at the right moment. But Elsie is infinitely\nmore dangerous to herself and others. Women's love is fierce enough, if\nit once gets the mastery of them, always; but this poor girl does not\nknow what to do with a passion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Bernard had never told Helen the story of the flower in his Virgil,\nor that other adventure--which he would have felt awkwardly to refer to;\nbut it had been perfectly understood between them that Elsie showed in\nher own singular way a well-marked partiality for the young master.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy don't they take her away from the school, if she is in such a\nstrange, excitable state?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Bernard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe they are afraid of her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helen answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is just one of\nthose cases that are ten thousand thousand times worse than insanity. I\ndon't think from what I hear, that her father has ever given up hoping\nthat she will outgrow her peculiarities. Oh, these peculiar children for\nwhom parents go on hoping every morning and despairing every night! If\nI could tell you half that mothers have told me, you would feel that the\nworst of all diseases of the moral sense and the will are those which\nall the Bedlams turn away from their doors as not being cases of\ninsanity!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think her father has treated her judiciously?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Bernard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Helen, with a little hesitation, which Mr. Bernard did\nnot happen to notice,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think he has been very kind and indulgent,\nand I do not know that he could have treated her otherwise with a better\nchance of success.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe must of course be fond of her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Bernard said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is nothing\nelse in the world for him to love.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelen dropped a book she held in her hand, and, stooping to pick it up,\nthe blood rushed into her cheeks.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is getting late,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must not stay any longer in\nthis close schoolroom. Pray, go and get a little fresh air before\ndinner-time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII. A SOUL IN DISTRESS.\n\nThe events told in the last two chapters had taken place toward the\nclose of the week. On Saturday evening the Reverend Chauncy Fairweather\nreceived a note which was left at his door by an unknown person who\ndeparted without saying a word. Its words were these: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne who is in\ndistress of mind requests the prayers of this congregation that God\nwould be pleased to look in mercy upon the soul that he has afflicted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was nothing to show from whom the note came, or the sex or age\nor special source of spiritual discomfort or anxiety of the writer. The\nhandwriting was delicate and might well be a woman's. The clergyman was\nnot aware of any particular affliction among his parishioners which was\nlikely to be made the subject of a request of this kind. Surely neither\nof the Venners would advertise the attempted crime of their relative in\nthis way. But who else was there? The more he thought about it, the\nmore it puzzled him, and as he did not like to pray in the dark, without\nknowing for whom he was praying, he could think of nothing better than\nto step into old Doctor Kittredge's and see what he had to say about it.\n\nThe old Doctor was sitting alone in his study when the Reverend Mr.\nFairweather was ushered in. He received his visitor very pleasantly,\nexpecting, as a matter of course, that he would begin with some new\ngrievance, dyspeptic, neuralgic, bronchitic, or other. The minister,\nhowever, began with questioning the old Doctor about the sequel of the\nother night's adventure; for he was already getting a little Jesuitical,\nand kept back the object of his visit until it should come up as if\naccidentally in the course of conversation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a pretty bold thing to go off alone with that reprobate, as you\ndid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the minister.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know what there was bold about it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll\nhe wanted was to get away. He was not quite a reprobate, you see; he\ndidn't like the thought of disgracing his family or facing his uncle. I\nthink he was ashamed to see his cousin, too, after what he had done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid he talk with you on the way?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot much. For half an hour or so he did n't speak a word. Then he asked\nwhere I was driving him. I told him, and he seemed to be surprised into\na sort of grateful feeling. Bad enough, no doubt, but might be worse.\nHas some humanity left in him yet. Let him go. God can judge him,--I\ncan't.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are too charitable, Doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the minister said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI condemn him just\nas if he had carried out his project, which, they say, was to make it\nappear as if the schoolmaster had committed suicide. That's what people\nthink the rope found by him was for. He has saved his neck,--but his\nsoul is a lost one, I am afraid, beyond question.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can't judge men's souls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can judge their acts,\nand hold them responsible for those,--but I don't know much about their\nsouls. If you or I had found our soul in a half-breed body; and been\nturned loose to run among the Indians, we might have been playing\njust such tricks as this fellow has been trying. What if you or I had\ninherited all the tendencies that were born with his cousin Elsie?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, that reminds me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--the minister said, in a sudden way,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have\nreceived a note, which I am requested to read from the pulpit tomorrow.\nI wish you would just have the kindness to look at it and see where you\nthink it came from.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor examined it carefully. It was a woman's or girl's note, he\nthought. Might come from one of the school-girls who was anxious about\nher spiritual condition. Handwriting was disguised; looked a little like\nElsie Veneer's, but not characteristic enough to make it certain. It\nwould be a new thing, if she had asked public prayers for herself, and\na very favorable indication of a change in her singular moral nature. It\nwas just possible Elsie might have sent that note. Nobody could foretell\nher actions. It would be well to see the girl and find out whether\nany unusual impression had been produced on her mind by the recent\noccurrence or by any other cause.\n\nThe Reverend Mr. Fairweather folded the note and put it into his pocket.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been a good deal exercised in mind lately, myself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nThe old Doctor looked at him through his spectacles, and said, in his\nusual professional tone,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPut out your tongue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe minister obeyed him in that feeble way common with persons of weak\ncharacter,--for people differ as much in their mode of performing this\ntrifling act as Gideon's soldiers in their way of drinking at the brook.\nThe Doctor took his hand and placed a finger mechanically on his wrist.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is more spiritual, I think, than bodily,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Reverend Mr.\nFairweather.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs your appetite as good as usual?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPretty good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the minister answered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut my sleep, my sleep,\nDoctor,--I am greatly troubled at night with lying awake and thinking of\nmy future, I am not at ease in mind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked round at all the doors, to be sure they were shut, and moved\nhis chair up close to the Doctor's.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou do not know the mental trials I have been going through for the\nlast few months.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the old Doctor said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou want to get out of the new\nchurch into the old one, don't you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe minister blushed deeply; he thought he had been going on in a very\nquiet way, and that nobody suspected his secret. As the old Doctor was\nhis counsellor in sickness, and almost everybody's confidant in trouble,\nhe had intended to impart cautiously to him some hints of the change of\nsentiments through which he had been passing. He was too late with his\ninformation, it appeared, and there was nothing to be done but to throw\nhimself on the Doctor's good sense and kindness, which everybody knew,\nand get what hints he could from him as to the practical course he\nshould pursue. He began, after an awkward pause,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou would not have me stay in a communion which I feel to be alien to\nthe true church, would you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you stay, my friend?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, with a pleasant, friendly\nlook,--\u00e2\u0080\u009chave you stay? Not a month, nor a week, nor a day, if I could\nhelp it. You have got into the wrong pulpit, and I have known it from\nthe first. The sooner you go where you belong, the better. And I'm very\nglad you don't mean to stop half-way. Don't you know you've always\ncome to me when you've been dyspeptic or sick anyhow, and wanted to put\nyourself wholly into my hands, so that I might order you like a child\njust what to do and what to take? That 's exactly what you want\nin religion. I don't blame you for it. You never liked to take the\nresponsibility of your own body; I don't see why you should want to have\nthe charge of your own soul. But I'm glad you're going to the Old Mother\nof all. You wouldn't have been contented short of that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Reverend Mr. Fairweather breathed with more freedom. The Doctor saw\ninto his soul through those awful spectacles of his,--into it and\nbeyond it, as one sees through a thin fog. But it was with a real human\nkindness, after all. He felt like a child before a strong man; but the\nstrong man looked on him with a father's indulgence. Many and many a\ntime, when he had come desponding and bemoaning himself on account of\nsome contemptible bodily infirmity, the old Doctor had looked at him\nthrough his spectacles, listened patiently while he told his ailments,\nand then, in his large parental way, given him a few words of wholesome\nadvice, and cheered him up so that he went off with a light heart,\nthinking that the heaven he was so much afraid of was not so very near,\nafter all. It was the same thing now. He felt, as feeble natures always\ndo in the presence of strong ones, overmastered, circumscribed, shut in,\nhumbled; but yet it seemed as if the old Doctor did not despise him any\nmore for what he considered weakness of mind than he used to despise him\nwhen he complained of his nerves or his digestion.\n\nMen who see into their neighbors are very apt to be contemptuous; but\nmen who see through them find something lying behind every human soul\nwhich it is not for them to sit in judgment on, or to attempt to sneer\nout of the order of God's manifold universe.\n\nLittle as the Doctor had said out of which comfort could be extracted,\nhis genial manner had something grateful in it. A film of gratitude\ncame over the poor man's cloudy, uncertain eye, and a look of tremulous\nrelief and satisfaction played about his weak mouth. He was gravitating\nto the majority, where he hoped to find \u00e2\u0080\u009crest\u00e2\u0080\u009d; but he was dreadfully\nsensitive to the opinions of the minority he was on the point of\nleaving.\n\nThe old Doctor saw plainly enough what was going on in his mind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI sha'n't quarrel with you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cyou know that very well; but\nyou mustn't quarrel with me, if I talk honestly with you; it isn't\neverybody that will take the trouble. You flatter yourself that you will\nmake a good many enemies by leaving your old communion. Not so many as\nyou think. This is the way the common sort of people will talk:--'You\nhave got your ticket to the feast of life, as much as any other man that\never lived. Protestantism says,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cHelp yourself; here's a clean plate,\nand a knife and fork of your own, and plenty of fresh dishes to choose\nfrom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Old Mother says,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cGive me your ticket, my dear, and I'll\nfeed you with my gold spoon off these beautiful old wooden trenchers.\nSuch nice bits as those good old gentlemen have left for you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d There is\nno quarrelling with a man who prefers broken victuals. That's what the\nrougher sort will say; and then, where one scolds, ten will laugh. But,\nmind you, I don't either scold or laugh. I don't feel sure that you\ncould very well have helped doing what you will soon do. You know you\nwere never easy without some medicine to take when you felt ill in\nbody. I'm afraid I've given you trashy stuff sometimes, just to keep\nyou quiet. Now, let me tell you, there is just the same difference in\nspiritual patients that there is in bodily ones. One set believes\nin wholesome ways of living, and another must have a great list of\nspecifics for all the soul's complaints. You belong with the last, and\ngot accidentally shuffled in with the others.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe minister smiled faintly, but did not reply. Of course, he considered\nthat way of talking as the result of the Doctor's professional training.\nIt would not have been worth while to take offence at his plain speech,\nif he had been so disposed; for he might wish to consult him the next\nday as to \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat he should take\u00e2\u0080\u009d for his dyspepsia or his neuralgia.\n\nHe left the Doctor with a hollow feeling at the bottom of his soul, as\nif a good piece of his manhood had been scooped out of him. His hollow\naching did not explain itself in words, but it grumbled and worried down\namong the unshaped thoughts which lie beneath them. He knew that he had\nbeen trying to reason himself out of his birthright of reason. He knew\nthat the inspiration which gave him understanding was losing its throne\nin his intelligence, and the almighty Majority-Vote was proclaiming\nitself in its stead. He knew that the great primal truths, which each\nsuccessive revelation only confirmed, were fast becoming hidden beneath\nthe mechanical forms of thought, which, as with all new converts,\nengrossed so large a share of his attention. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the \u00e2\u0080\u009crest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n which he had purchased were dearly bought to one who had been trained\nto the arms of thought, and whose noble privilege it might have been\nto live in perpetual warfare for the advancing truth which the next\ngeneration will claim as the legacy of the present.\n\nThe Reverend Mr. Fairweather was getting careless about his sermons. He\nmust wait the fitting moment to declare himself; and in the mean time\nhe was preaching to heretics. It did not matter much what he preached,\nunder such circumstances. He pulled out two old yellow sermons from a\nheap of such, and began looking over that for the forenoon. Naturally\nenough, he fell asleep over it, and, sleeping, he began to dream.\n\nHe dreamed that he was under the high arches of an old cathedral, amidst\na throng of worshippers. The light streamed in through vast windows,\ndark with the purple robes of royal saints, or blazing with yellow\nglories around the heads of earthly martyrs and heavenly messengers. The\nbillows of the great organ roared among the clustered columns, as the\nsea breaks amidst the basaltic pillars which crowd the stormy cavern of\nthe Hebrides. The voice of the alternate choirs of singing boys swung\nback and forward, as the silver censer swung in the hands of the\nwhite-robed children. The sweet cloud of incense rose in soft, fleecy\nmists, full of penetrating suggestions of the East and its perfumed\naltars. The knees of twenty generations had worn the pavement; their\nfeet had hollowed the steps; their shoulders had smoothed the columns.\nDead bishops and abbots lay under the marble of the floor in their\ncrumbled vestments; dead warriors, in rusted armor, were stretched\nbeneath their sculptured effigies. And all at once all the buried\nmultitudes who had ever worshipped there came thronging in through the\naisles. They choked every space, they swarmed into all the chapels, they\nhung in clusters over the parapets of the galleries, they clung to\nthe images in every niche, and still the vast throng kept flowing and\nflowing in, until the living were lost in the rush of the returning dead\nwho had reclaimed their own. Then, as his dream became more fantastic,\nthe huge cathedral itself seemed to change into the wreck of some mighty\nantediluvian vertebrate; its flying-buttresses arched round like ribs,\nits piers shaped themselves into limbs, and the sound of the organ-blast\nchanged to the wind whistling through its thousand-jointed skeleton.\n\nAnd presently the sound lulled, and softened and softened, until it was\nas the murmur of a distant swarm of bees. A procession of monks wound\nalong through an old street, chanting, as they walked. In his dream he\nglided in among them and bore his part in the burden of their song.\nHe entered with the long train under a low arch, and presently he was\nkneeling in a narrow cell before an image of the Blessed Maiden holding\nthe Divine Child in her arms, and his lips seemed to whisper,\n\n               Sancta Maria, ora pro nobis!\n\nHe turned to the crucifix, and, prostrating himself before the spare,\nagonizing shape of the Holy Sufferer, fell into a long passion of tears\nand broken prayers. He rose and flung himself, worn-out, upon his hard\npallet, and, seeming to slumber, dreamed again within his dream. Once\nmore in the vast cathedral, with throngs of the living choking its\naisles, amidst jubilant peals from the cavernous depths of the great\norgan, and choral melodies ringing from the fluty throats of the singing\nboys. A day of great rejoicings,--for a prelate was to be consecrated,\nand the bones of the mighty skeleton-minster were shaking with anthems,\nas if there were life of its own within its buttressed ribs. He looked\ndown at his feet; the folds of the sacred robe were flowing about them:\nhe put his hand to his head; it was crowned with the holy mitre. A\nlong sigh, as of perfect content in the consummation of all his earthly\nhopes, breathed through the dreamer's lips, and shaped itself, as it\nescaped, into the blissful murmur,\n\n               Ego sum Episcopus!\n\nOne grinning gargoyle looked in from beneath the roof through an opening\nin a stained window. It was the face of a mocking fiend, such as the old\nbuilders loved to place under the eaves to spout the rain through their\nopen mouths. It looked at him, as he sat in his mitred chair, with its\nhideous grin growing broader and broader, until it laughed out aloud,\nsuch a hard, stony, mocking laugh, that he awoke out of his second dream\nthrough his first into his common consciousness, and shivered, as he\nturned to the two yellow sermons which he was to pick over and weed of\nthe little thought they might contain, for the next day's service.\n\nThe Reverend Chauncy Fairweather was too much taken up with his own\nbodily and spiritual condition to be deeply mindful of others. He\ncarried the note requesting the prayers of the congregation in his\npocket all day; and the soul in distress, which a single tender petition\nmight have soothed, and perhaps have saved from despair or fatal error,\nfound no voice in the temple to plead for it before the Throne of Mercy!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII. THE SECRET IS WHISPERED.\n\nThe Reverend Chauncy Fairweather's congregation was not large, but\nselect. The lines of social cleavage run through religious creeds as\nif they were of a piece with position and fortune. It is expected of\npersons of a certain breeding, in some parts of New England, that they\nshall be either Episcopalians or Unitarians. The mansion-house gentry of\nRockland were pretty fairly divided between the little chapel, with the\nstained window and the trained rector, and the meeting-house where the\nReverend Mr. Fairweather officiated.\n\nIt was in the latter that Dudley Venner worshipped, when he attended\nservice anywhere,--which depended very much on the caprice of Elsie. He\nsaw plainly enough that a generous and liberally cultivated nature might\nfind a refuge and congenial souls in either of these two persuasions,\nbut he objected to some points of the formal creed of the older church,\nand especially to the mechanism which renders it hard to get free\nfrom its outworn and offensive formulae,--remembering how Archbishop\nTillotson wished in vain that it could be \u00e2\u0080\u009cwell rid of\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Athanasian\nCreed. This, and the fact that the meeting-house was nearer than the\nchapel, determined him, when the new rector, who was not quite up to\nhis mark in education, was appointed, to take a pew in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cliberal\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n worshippers' edifice.\n\nElsie was very uncertain in her feeling about going to church. In\nsummer, she loved rather to stroll over The Mountain, on Sundays. There\nwas even a story, that she had one of the caves before mentioned fitted\nup as an oratory, and that she had her own wild way of worshipping\nthe God whom she sought in the dark chasms of the dreaded cliffs. Mere\nfables, doubtless; but they showed the common belief, that Elsie, with\nall her strange and dangerous elements of character, had yet strong\nreligious feeling mingled with them. The hymn-book which Dick had found,\nin his midnight invasion of her chamber, opened to favorite hymns,\nespecially some of the Methodist and Quietist character. Many had\nnoticed, that certain tunes, as sung by the choir, seemed to impress\nher deeply; and some said, that at such times her whole expression would\nchange, and her stormy look would soften so as to remind them of her\npoor, sweet mother.\n\nOn the Sunday morning after the talk recorded in the last chapter, Elsie\nmade herself ready to go to meeting. She was dressed much as usual,\nexcepting that she wore a thick veil, turned aside, but ready to conceal\nher features. It was natural enough that she should not wish to be\nlooked in the face by curious persons who would be staring to see what\neffect the occurrence of the past week had had on her spirits. Her\nfather attended her willingly; and they took their seats in the pew,\nsomewhat to the surprise of many, who had hardly expected to see them,\nafter so humiliating a family development as the attempted crime of\ntheir kinsman had just been furnishing for the astonishment of the\npublic.\n\nThe Reverend Mr. Fairweather was now in his coldest mood. He had passed\nthrough the period of feverish excitement which marks a change of\nreligious opinion. At first, when he had began to doubt his own\ntheological positions, he had defended them against himself with\nmore ingenuity and interest, perhaps, than he could have done against\nanother; because men rarely take the trouble to understand anybody's\ndifficulties in a question but their own. After this, as he began\nto draw off from different points of his old belief, the cautious\ndisentangling of himself from one mesh after another gave sharpness to\nhis intellect, and the tremulous eagerness with which he seized upon the\ndoctrine which, piece by piece, under various pretexts and with various\ndisguises, he was appropriating, gave interest and something like\npassion to his words. But when he had gradually accustomed his people\nto his new phraseology, and was really adjusting his sermons and his\nservice to disguise his thoughts, he lost at once all his intellectual\nacuteness and all his spiritual fervor.\n\nElsie sat quietly through the first part of the service, which was\nconducted in the cold, mechanical way to be expected. Her face was\nhidden by her veil; but her father knew her state of feeling, as well\nby her movements and attitudes as by the expression of her features. The\nhymn had been sung, the short prayer offered, the Bible read, and the\nlong prayer was about to begin. This was the time at which the \u00e2\u0080\u009cnotes\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n of any who were in affliction from loss of friends, the sick who\nwere doubtful of recovery, those who had cause to be grateful for\npreservation of life or other signal blessing, were wont to be read.\n\nJust then it was that Dudley Veneer noticed that his daughter was\ntrembling,--a thing so rare, so unaccountable, indeed, under the\ncircumstances, that he watched her closely, and began to fear that some\nnervous paroxysm, or other malady, might have just begun to show itself\nin this way upon her.\n\nThe minister had in his pocket two notes. One, in the handwriting of\nDeacon Soper, was from a member of this congregation, returning thanks\nfor his preservation through a season of great peril, supposed to be the\nexposure which he had shared with others, when standing in the circle\naround Dick Veneer. The other was the anonymous one, in a female hand,\nwhich he had received the evening before. He forgot them both. His\nthoughts were altogether too much taken up with more important matters.\nHe prayed through all the frozen petitions of his expurgated form of\nsupplication, and not a single heart was soothed or lifted, or reminded\nthat its sorrows were struggling their way up to heaven, borne on the\nbreath from a human soul that was warm with love.\n\nThe people sat down as if relieved when the dreary prayer was finished.\nElsie alone remained standing until her father touched her. Then she sat\ndown, lifted her veil, and looked at him with a blank, sad look, as\nif she had suffered some pain or wrong, but could not give any name or\nexpression to her vague trouble. She did not tremble any longer, but\nremained ominously still, as if she had been frozen where she sat.\n\n--Can a man love his own soul too well? Who, on the whole, constitute\nthe nobler class of human beings? those who have lived mainly to make\nsure of their own personal welfare in another and future condition of\nexistence, or they who have worked with all their might for their race,\nfor their country, for the advancement of the kingdom of God, and left\nall personal arrangements concerning themselves to the sole charge of\nHim who made them and is responsible to himself for their safe-keeping?\nIs an anchorite who has worn the stone floor of his cell into basins\nwith his knees bent in prayer, more acceptable than the soldier who\ngives his life for the maintenance of any sacred right or truth, without\nthinking what will specially become of him in a world where there are\ntwo or three million colonists a month, from this one planet, to be\ncared for? These are grave questions, which must suggest themselves to\nthose who know that there are many profoundly selfish persons who are\nsincerely devout and perpetually occupied with their own future, while\nthere are others who are perfectly ready to sacrifice themselves for\nany worthy object in this world, but are really too little occupied with\ntheir exclusive personality to think so much as many do about what is to\nbecome of them in another.\n\nThe Reverend Chauncy Fairweather did not, most certainly, belong to this\nlatter class. There are several kinds of believers, whose history we\nfind among the early converts to Christianity.\n\nThere was the magistrate, whose social position was such that he\npreferred a private interview in the evening with the Teacher to\nfollowing him--with the street-crowd. He had seen extraordinary facts\nwhich had satisfied him that the young Galilean had a divine commission.\nBut still he cross-questioned the Teacher himself. He was not ready to\naccept statements without explanation. That was the right kind of man.\nSee how he stood up for the legal rights of his Master, when the people\nwere for laying hands on him!\n\nAnd again, there was the government official, intrusted with public\nmoney, which, in those days, implied that he was supposed to be honest.\nA single look of that heavenly countenance, and two words of gentle\ncommand, were enough for him. Neither of these men, the early disciple,\nnor the evangelist, seems to have been thinking primarily about his own\npersonal safety.\n\nBut now look at the poor, miserable turnkey, whose occupation shows\nwhat he was like to be, and who had just been thrusting two respectable\nstrangers, taken from the hands of a mob, covered with stripes and\nstripped of clothing, into the inner prison, and making their feet fast\nin the stocks. His thought, in the moment of terror, is for himself:\nfirst, suicide; then, what he shall do,--not to save his household,--not\nto fulfil his duty to his office,--not to repair the outrage he has been\ncommitting,--but to secure his own personal safety. Truly, character\nshows itself as much in a man's way of becoming a Christian as in any\nother!\n\n--Elsie sat, statue-like, through the sermon. It would not be fair to\nthe reader to give an abstract of that. When a man who has been bred to\nfree thought and free speech suddenly finds himself stepping about, like\na dancer amidst his eggs, among the old addled majority-votes which he\nmust not tread upon, he is a spectacle for men and angels. Submission to\nintellectual precedent and authority does very well for those who have\nbeen bred to it; we know that the underground courses of their minds\nare laid in the Roman cement of tradition, and that stately and splendid\nstructures may be reared on such a foundation. But to see one laying a\nplatform over heretical quicksands, thirty or forty or fifty years deep,\nand then beginning to build upon it, is a sorry sight. A new convert\nfrom the reformed to the ancient faith may be very strong in the arms,\nbut he will always have weak legs and shaky knees. He may use his hands\nwell, and hit hard with his fists, but he will never stand on his legs\nin the way the man does who inherits his belief.\n\nThe services were over at last, and Dudley Venner and his daughter\nwalked home together in silence. He always respected her moods, and saw\nclearly enough that some inward trouble was weighing upon her. There\nwas nothing to be said in such cases, for Elsie could never talk of her\ngriefs. An hour, or a day, or a week of brooding, with perhaps a sudden\nflash of violence: this was the way in which the impressions which make\nother women weep, and tell their griefs by word or letter, showed their\neffects in her mind and acts.\n\nShe wandered off up into the remoter parts of The Mountain, that day,\nafter their return. No one saw just where she went,--indeed, no one knew\nits forest-recesses and rocky fastnesses as she did. She was gone until\nlate at night; and when Old Sophy, who had watched for her, bound up her\nlong hair for her sleep, it was damp with the cold dews.\n\nThe old black woman looked at her without speaking, but questioning her\nwith every feature as to the sorrow that was weighing on her.\n\nSuddenly she turned to Old Sophy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou want to know what there is troubling me;\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody loves\nme. I cannot love anybody. What is love, Sophy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's what poor Ol' Sophy's got for her Elsie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the old woman answered.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me, darlin',--don' you love somebody?--don' you love? you\nknow,--oh, tell me, darlin', don' you love to see the gen'l'man\nthat keeps up at the school where you go? They say he's the pootiest\ngen'l'man that was ever in the town here. Don' be 'fraid of poor Ol'\nSophy, darlin',--she loved a man once,--see here! Oh, I've showed you\nthis often enough!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe took from her pocket a half of one of the old Spanish silver coins,\nsuch as were current in the earlier part of this century. The other half\nof it had been lying in the deep sea-sand for more than fifty years.\n\nElsie looked her in the face, but did not answer in words. What strange\nintelligence was that which passed between them through the diamond\neyes and the little beady black ones?--what subtile intercommunication,\npenetrating so much deeper than articulate speech? This was the nearest\napproach to sympathetic relations that Elsie ever had: a kind of dumb\nintercourse of feeling, such as one sees in the eyes of brute mothers\nlooking on their young. But, subtile as it was, it was narrow and\nindividual; whereas an emotion which can shape itself in language opens\nthe gate for itself into the great community of human affections; for\nevery word we speak is the medal of a dead thought or feeling, struck in\nthe die of some human experience, worn smooth by innumerable contacts,\nand always transferred warm from one to another. By words we share\nthe common consciousness of the race, which has shaped itself in these\nsymbols. By music we reach those special states of consciousness which,\nbeing without form, cannot be shaped with the mosaics of the vocabulary.\nThe language of the eyes runs deeper into the personal nature, but it is\npurely individual, and perishes in the expression.\n\nIf we consider them all as growing out of the consciousness as their\nroot, language is the leaf, music is the flower; but when the eyes meet\nand search each other, it is the uncovering of the blanched stem through\nwhich the whole life runs, but which has never taken color or form from\nthe sunlight.\n\nFor three days Elsie did not return to the school. Much of the time she\nwas among the woods and rocks. The season was now beginning to wane, and\nthe forest to put on its autumnal glory. The dreamy haze was beginning\nto soften the landscape, and the mast delicious days of the year were\nlending their attraction to the scenery of The Mountain. It was not very\nsingular that Elsie should be lingering in her old haunts, from which\nthe change of season must soon drive her. But Old Sophy saw clearly\nenough that some internal conflict was going on, and knew very well that\nit must have its own way and work itself out as it best could. As much\nas looks could tell Elsie had told her. She had said in words, to be\nsure, that she could not love. Something warped and thwarted the emotion\nwhich would have been love in another, no doubt; but that such an\nemotion was striving with her against all malign influences which\ninterfered with it the old woman had a perfect certainty in her own\nmind.\n\nEverybody who has observed the working of emotions in persons of various\ntemperaments knows well enough that they have periods of incubation,\nwhich differ with the individual, and with the particular cause and\ndegree of excitement, yet evidently go through a strictly self-limited\nseries of evolutions, at the end of which, their result--an act of\nviolence, a paroxysm of tears, a gradual subsidence into repose, or\nwhatever it may be--declares itself, like the last stage of an attack of\nfever and ague. No one can observe children without noticing that there\nis a personal equation, to use the astronomer's language, in their\ntempers, so that one sulks an hour over an offence which makes another a\nfury for five minutes, and leaves him or her an angel when it is over.\n\nAt the end of three days, Elsie braided her long, glossy, black hair,\nand shot a golden arrow through it. She dressed herself with more than\nusual care, and came down in the morning superb in her stormy beauty.\nThe brooding paroxysm was over, or at least her passion had changed its\nphase. Her father saw it with great relief; he had always many fears for\nher in her hours and days of gloom, but, for reasons before assigned,\nhad felt that she must be trusted to herself, without appealing to\nactual restraint, or any other supervision than such as Old Sophy could\nexercise without offence.\n\nShe went off at the accustomed hour to the school. All the girls had\ntheir eyes on her. None so keen as these young misses to know an inward\nmovement by an outward sign of adornment: if they have not as many\nsignals as the ships that sail the great seas, there is not an end of\nribbon or a turn of a ringlet which is not a hieroglyphic with a hidden\nmeaning to these little cruisers over the ocean of sentiment.\n\nThe girls all looked at Elsie with a new thought; for she was more\nsumptuously arrayed than perhaps ever before at the school; and they\nsaid to themselves that she had come meaning to draw the young master's\neyes upon her. That was it; what else could it be? The beautiful cold\ngirl with the diamond eyes meant to dazzle the handsome young gentleman.\nHe would be afraid to love her; it couldn't be true, that which some\npeople had said in the village; she was n't the kind of young lady to\nmake Mr. Langdon happy. Those dark people are never safe: so one of the\nyoung blondes said to herself. Elsie was not literary enough for such\na scholar: so thought Miss Charlotte Ann Wood, the young poetess. She\ncouldn't have a good temper, with those scowling eyebrows: this was the\nopinion of several broad-faced, smiling girls, who thought, each in her\nown snug little mental sanctum, that, if, etc., etc., she could make him\nso happy!\n\nElsie had none of the still, wicked light in her eyes, that morning.\nShe looked gentle, but dreamy; played with her books; did not trouble\nherself with any of the exercises,--which in itself was not very\nremarkable, as she was always allowed, under some pretext or other, to\nhave her own way.\n\nThe school-hours were over at length. The girls went out, but she\nlingered to the last. She then came up to Mr. Bernard, with a book in\nher hand, as if to ask a question.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you walk towards my home with me today?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, in a very low\nvoice, little more than a whisper.\n\nMr. Bernard was startled by the request, put in such a way. He had a\npresentiment of some painful scene or other. But there was nothing to be\ndone but to assure her that it would give him great pleasure.\n\nSo they walked along together on their way toward the Dudley mansion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Elsie said, all at once. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing loves me but one\nold woman. I cannot love anybody. They tell me there is something in my\neyes that draws people to me and makes them faint: Look into them, will\nyou?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe turned her face toward him. It was very pale, and the diamond eyes\nwere glittering with a film, such as beneath other lids would have\nrounded into a tear.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeautiful eyes, Elsie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,--\u00e2\u0080\u009csometimes very piercing,--but soft\nnow, and looking as if there were something beneath them that friendship\nmight draw out. I am your friend, Elsie. Tell me what I can do to render\nyour life happier.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLove me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Elsie Venner.\n\nWhat shall a man do, when a woman makes such a demand, involving such\nan avowal? It was the tenderest, cruellest, humblest moment of Mr.\nBernard's life. He turned pale, he trembled almost, as if he had been a\nwoman listening to her lover's declaration.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cElsie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, presently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI so long to be of some use to you, to\nhave your confidence and sympathy, that I must not let you say or\ndo anything to put us in false relations. I do love you, Elsie, as a\nsuffering sister with sorrows of her own,--as one whom I would save at\nthe risk of my happiness and life,--as one who needs a true friend more\nthan--any of all the young girls I have known. More than this you would\nnot ask me to say. You have been through excitement and trouble lately,\nand it has made you feel such a need more than ever. Give me your hand,\ndear Elsie, and trust me that I will be as true a friend to you as if we\nwere children of the same mother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nElsie gave him her hand mechanically. It seemed to him that a cold aura\nshot from it along his arm and chilled the blood running through his\nheart. He pressed it gently, looked at her with a face full of grave\nkindness and sad interest, then softly relinquished it.\n\nIt was all over with poor Elsie. They walked almost in silence the rest\nof the way. Mr. Bernard left her at the gate of the mansion-house, and\nreturned with sad forebodings. Elsie went at once to her own room, and\ndid not come from it at the usual hours. At last Old Sophy began to\nbe alarmed about her, went to her apartment, and, finding the door\nunlocked, entered cautiously. She found Elsie lying on her bed, her\nbrows strongly contracted, her eyes dull, her whole look that of great\nsuffering. Her first thought was that she had been doing herself a harm\nby some deadly means or other. But Elsie, saw her fear, and reassured\nher.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is nothing wrong, such as you are thinking of; I\nam not dying. You may send for the Doctor; perhaps he can take the pain\nfrom my head. That is all I want him to do. There is no use in the pain,\nthat I know of; if he can stop it, let him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo they sent for the old Doctor. It was not long before the solid trot\nof Caustic, the old bay horse, and the crashing of the gravel under the\nwheels, gave notice that the physician was driving up the avenue.\n\nThe old Doctor was a model for visiting practitioners. He always\ncame into the sick-room with a quiet, cheerful look, as if he had a\nconsciousness that he was bringing some sure relief with him. The way a\npatient snatches his first look at his doctor's face, to see whether\nhe is doomed, whether he is reprieved, whether he is unconditionally\npardoned, has really something terrible about it. It is only to be\nmet by an imperturbable mask of serenity, proof against anything and\neverything in a patient's aspect. The physician whose face reflects his\npatient's condition like a mirror may do well enough to examine people\nfor a life-insurance office, but does not belong to the sickroom. The\nold Doctor did not keep people waiting in dread suspense, while he\nstayed talking about the case,--the patient all the time thinking that\nhe and the friends are discussing some alarming symptom or formidable\noperation which he himself is by-and-by--to hear of.\n\nHe was in Elsie's room almost before she knew he was in the house. He\ncame to her bedside in such a natural, quiet way, that it seemed as if\nhe were only a friend who had dropped in for a moment to say a pleasant\nword. Yet he was very uneasy about Elsie until he had seen her; he never\nknew what might happen to her or those about her, and came prepared for\nthe worst.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSick, my child?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, in a very soft, low voice.\n\nElsie nodded, without speaking.\n\nThe Doctor took her hand,--whether with professional views, or only in a\nfriendly way, it would have been hard to tell. So he sat a few minutes,\nlooking at her all the time with a kind of fatherly interest, but with\nit all noting how she lay, how she breathed, her color, her expression,\nall that teaches the practised eye so much without a single question\nbeing asked. He saw she was in suffering, and said presently,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have pain somewhere; where is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe put her hand to her head.\n\nAs she was not disposed to talk, he watched her for a while, questioned\nOld Sophy shrewdly a few minutes, and so made up his mind as to the\nprobable cause of disturbance and the proper remedies to be used.\n\nSome very silly people thought the old Doctor did not believe in\nmedicine, because he gave less than certain poor half-taught creatures\nin the smaller neighboring towns, who took advantage of people's\nsickness to disgust and disturb them with all manner of ill-smelling\nand ill-behaving drugs. In truth, he hated to give anything noxious or\nloathsome to those who were uncomfortable enough already, unless he was\nvery sure it would do good,--in which case, he never played with drugs,\nbut gave good, honest, efficient doses. Sometimes he lost a family of\nthe more boorish sort, because they did not think they got their\nmoney's worth out of him, unless they had something more than a taste of\neverything he carried in his saddlebags.\n\nHe ordered some remedies which he thought would relieve Elsie, and left\nher, saying he would call the next day, hoping to find her better.\nBut the next day came, and the next, and still Elsie was on her bed,\nfeverish, restless, wakeful, silent. At night she tossed about and\nwandered, and it became at length apparent that there was a settled\nattack, something like what they called, formerly, a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnervous fever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOn the fourth day she was more restless than common. One of the women\nof the house came in to help to take care of her; but she showed an\naversion to her presence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSend me Helen Darley,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, at last.\n\nThe old Doctor told them, that, if possible, they must indulge this\nfancy of hers. The caprices of sick people were never to be despised,\nleast of all of such persons as Elsie, when rendered irritable and\nexacting by pain and weakness.\n\nSo a message was sent to Mr. Silas Peckham at the Apollinean Institute,\nto know if he could not spare Miss Helen Darley for a few days, if\nrequired, to give her attention to a young lady who attended his school\nand who was now lying ill,--no other person than the daughter of Dudley\nVenner.\n\nA mean man never agrees to anything without deliberately turning it\nover, so that he may see its dirty side, and, if he can, sweating the\ncoin he pays for it. If an archangel should offer to save his soul for\nsixpence, he would try to find a sixpence with a hole in it. A gentleman\nsays yes to a great many things without stopping to think: a shabby\nfellow is known by his caution in answering questions, for fear of,\ncompromising his pocket or himself.\n\nMr. Silas Peckham looked very grave at the request. The dooties of Miss\nDarley at the Institoot were important, very important. He paid her\nlarge sums of money for her time,--more than she could expect to get in\nany other institootion for the edoocation of female youth. A deduction\nfrom her selary would be necessary, in case she should retire from the\nsphere of her dooties for a season. He should be put to extry expense,\nand have to perform additional labors himself. He would consider of the\nmatter. If any arrangement could be made, he would send word to Squire\nVenner's folks.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Darley,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Silas Peckham, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe' 's a message from Squire\nVenner's that his daughter wants you down at the mansion-house to see\nher. She's got a fever, so they inform me. If it's any kind of ketchin'\nfever, of course you won't think of goin' near the mansion-house. If\nDoctor Kittredge says it's safe, perfec'ly safe, I can't object to your\ngoin', on sech conditions as seem to be fair to all' concerned. You will\ngive up your pay for the whole time you are absent,--portions of days to\nbe caounted as whole days. You will be charged with board the same as\nif you eat your victuals with the household. The victuals are of no use\nafter they're cooked but to be eat, and your bein' away is no savin' to\nour folks. I shall charge you a reasonable compensation for the demage\nto the school by the absence of a teacher. If Miss Crabs undertakes any\ndooties belongin' to your department of instruction, she will look to\nyou for sech pecooniary considerations as you may agree upon between\nyou. On these conditions I am willin' to give my consent to your\ntemporary absence from the post of dooty. I will step down to Doctor\nKittredge's myself, and make inquiries as to the natur' of the\ncomplaint.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Peckham took up a rusty and very narrow-brimmed hat, which he cocked\nupon one side of his head, with an air peculiar to the rural gentry. It\nwas the hour when the Doctor expected to be in his office, unless he had\nsome special call which kept him from home.\n\nHe found the Reverend Chauncy Fairweather just taking leave of the\nDoctor. His hand was on the pit of his stomach, and his countenance was\nexpressive of inward uneasiness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShake it before using,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand the sooner you make up\nyour mind to speak right out, the better it will be for your digestion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Mr. Peckham! Walk in, Mr. Peckham! Nobody sick up at the school, I\nhope?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe haalth of the school is fust-rate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Mr. Peckham. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nsitooation is uncommonly favorable to saloobrity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (These last words\nwere from the Annual Report of the past year.) \u00e2\u0080\u009cProvidence has spared\nour female youth in a remarkable measure. I've come with reference to\nanother consideration. Dr. Kittredge, is there any ketchin' complaint\ngoin' about in the village?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should say there was something of that\nsort. Measles. Mumps. And Sin,--that's always catching.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old Doctor's eye twinkled; once in a while he had his little touch\nof humor.\n\nSilas Peckham slanted his eye up suspiciously at the Doctor, as if he\nwas getting some kind of advantage over him. That is the way people of\nhis constitution are apt to take a bit of pleasantry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't mean sech things, Doctor; I mean fevers. Is there any ketchin'\nfevers--bilious, or nervous, or typus, or whatever you call 'em--now\ngoin' round this village? That's what I want to ascertain, if there's no\nimpropriety.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old Doctor looked at Silas through his spectacles.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHard and sour as a green cider-apple,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thought to himself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d; he\nsaid,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know any such cases.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat's the matter with Elsie Venner?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Silas, sharply, as if he\nexpected to have him this time.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA mild feverish attack, I should call it in anybody else; but she has\na peculiar constitution, and I never feel so safe about her as I should\nabout most people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnything ketchin' about it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Silas asked, cunningly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, indeed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Doctor,--\u00e2\u0080\u009ccatching? no,--what put that into your\nhead, Mr. Peckham?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the conscientious Principal answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI naterally feel\na graat responsibility, a very graaat responsibility, for the noomerous\nand lovely young ladies committed to my charge. It has been a question,\nwhether one of my assistants should go, accordin' to request, to stop\nwith Miss Venner for a season. Nothin' restrains my givin' my full and\nfree consent to her goin' but the fear lest contagious maladies should\nbe introdooced among those lovely female youth. I shall abide by your\nopinion,--I understan' you to say distinc'ly, her complaint is not\nketchin'?--and urge upon Miss Darley to fulfil her dooties to a\nsufferin' fellow-creature at any cost to myself and my establishment. We\nshall miss her very much; but it is a good cause, and she shall go,--and\nI shall trust that Providence will enable us to spare her without\npermanent demage to the interests of the Institootion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSaying this, the excellent Principal departed, with his rusty\nnarrow-brimmed hat leaning over, as if it had a six-knot breeze abeam,\nand its gunwale (so to speak) was dipping into his coat-collar. He\nannounced the result of his inquiries to Helen, who had received a brief\nnote in the mean time from a poor relation of Elsie's mother, then at\nthe mansion-house, informing her of the critical situation of Elsie\nand of her urgent desire that Helen should be with her. She could not\nhesitate. She blushed as she thought of the comments that might be made;\nbut what were such considerations in a matter of life and death? She\ncould not stop to make terms with Silas Peckham. She must go. He might\nfleece her, if he would; she would not complain,--not even to Bernard,\nwho, she knew, would bring the Principal to terms, if she gave the least\nhint of his intended extortions.\n\nSo Helen made up her bundle of clothes to be sent after her, took a book\nor two with her to help her pass the time, and departed for the Dudley\nmansion. It was with a great inward effort that she undertook the\nsisterly task which was thus forced upon her. She had a kind of terror\nof Elsie; and the thought of having charge of her, of being alone with\nher, of coming under the full influence of those diamond eyes,--if,\nindeed, their light were not dimmed by suffering and weariness,--was one\nshe shrank from. But what could she do? It might be a turning-point in\nthe life of the poor girl; and she must overcome all her fears, all her\nrepugnance, and go to her rescue.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs Helen come?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Elsie, when she heard, with her fine sense\nquickened by the irritability of sickness, a light footfall on the\nstair, with a cadence unlike that of any inmate of the house.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's a strange woman's step,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Old Sophy, who, with her exclusive\nlove for Elsie, was naturally disposed to jealousy of a new-comer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\nOl' Sophy set at 'th' foot o' th' bed, if th' young missis sets by th'\npiller,--won' y', darlin'? The' 's nobody that's white can love y'\nas th' of black woman does;--don' sen' her away, now, there 's a dear\nsoul!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nElsie motioned her to sit in the place she had pointed to, and Helen at\nthat moment entered the room. Dudley Venner followed her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is your patient,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cexcept while the Doctor is here. She\nhas been longing to have you with her, and we shall expect you to make\nher well in a few days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo Helen Darley found herself established in the most unexpected manner\nas an inmate of the Dudley mansion. She sat with Elsie most of the\ntime, by day and by night, soothing her, and trying to enter into her\nconfidence and affections, if it should prove that this strange creature\nwas really capable of truly sympathetic emotions.\n\nWhat was this unexplained something which came between her soul and\nthat of every other human being with whom she was in relations? Helen\nperceived, or rather felt, that she had, folded up in the depths of\nher being, a true womanly nature. Through the cloud that darkened her\naspect, now and then a ray would steal forth, which, like the smile of\nstern and solemn people, was all the more impressive from its contrast\nwith the expression she wore habitually. It might well be that pain and\nfatigue had changed her aspect; but, at any rate, Helen looked into\nher eyes without that nervous agitation which their cold glitter had\nproduced on her when they were full of their natural light. She felt\nsure that her mother must have been a lovely, gentle woman. There were\ngleams of a beautiful nature shining through some ill-defined medium\nwhich disturbed and made them flicker and waver, as distant images do\nwhen seen through the rippling upward currents of heated air. She loved,\nin her own way, the old black woman, and seemed to keep up a kind of\nsilent communication with her, as if they did not require the use of\nspeech. She appeared to be tranquillized by the presence of Helen, and\nloved to have her seated at the bedside. Yet something, whatever it was,\nprevented her from opening her heart to her kind companion; and even now\nthere were times when she would lie looking at her, with such a still,\nwatchful, almost dangerous expression, that Helen would sigh, and change\nher place, as persons do whose breath some cunning orator had been\nsucking out of them with his spongy eloquence, so that, when he stops,\nthey must get some air and stir about, or they feel as if they should be\nhalf smothered and palsied.\n\nIt was too much to keep guessing what was the meaning of all this. Helen\ndetermined to ask Old Sophy some questions which might probably throw\nlight upon her doubts. She took the opportunity one evening when Elsie\nwas lying asleep and they were both sitting at some distance from her\nbed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me, Sophy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas Elsie always as shy as she seems to be\nnow, in talking with those to whom she is friendly?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlway jes' so, Miss Darlin', ever sense she was little chil'. When she\nwas five, six year old, she lisp some,--call me Thophy; that make her\nkin' o' 'shamed, perhaps: after she grow up, she never lisp, but she\nkin' o' got the way o' not talkin' much. Fac' is, she don' like talkin'\nas common gals do, 'xcep' jes' once in a while wi' some partic'lar\nfolks,--'n' then not much.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow old is Elsie?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEighteen year this las' September.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow long ago did her mother die?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helen asked, with a little trembling\nin her voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEighteen year ago this October,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Old Sophy.\n\nHelen was silent for a moment. Then she whispered, almost\ninaudibly,--for her voice appeared to fail her,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat did her mother die of, Sophy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old woman's small eyes dilated until a ring of white showed round\ntheir beady centres. She caught Helen by the hand and clung to it, as if\nin fear. She looked round at Elsie, who lay sleeping, as of she might be\nlistening. Then she drew Helen towards her and led her softly out of the\nroom.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c'Sh!--'sh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, as soon as they were outside the door. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon'\nnever speak in this house 'bout what Elsie's mother died of!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody never says nothin' 'bout it. Oh, God has made Ugly Things wi'\ndeath in their mouths, Miss Darlin', an' He knows what they're for; but\nmy poor Elsie!--to have her blood changed in her before--It was in July\nMistress got her death, but she liv' till three week after my poor Elsie\nwas born.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe could speak no more. She had said enough. Helen remembered the\nstories she had heard on coming to the village, and among them one\nreferred to in an early chapter of this narrative. All the unaccountable\nlooks and tastes and ways of Elsie came back to her in the light of an\nante-natal impression which had mingled an alien element in her nature.\nShe knew the secret of the fascination which looked out of her cold,\nglittering eyes. She knew the significance of the strange repulsion\nwhich she felt in her own intimate consciousness underlying the\ninexplicable attraction which drew her towards the young girl in\nspite of this repugnance. She began to look with new feelings on the\ncontradictions in her moral nature,--the longing for sympathy, as shown\nby her wishing for Helen's company, and the impossibility of passing\nbeyond the cold circle of isolation within which she had her being.\nThe fearful truth of that instinctive feeling of hers, that there was\nsomething not human looking out of Elsie's eyes, came upon her with\na sudden flash of penetrating conviction. There were two warring\nprinciples in that superb organization and proud soul. One made her a\nwoman, with all a woman's powers and longings. The other chilled all the\ncurrents of outlet for her emotions. It made her tearless and mute, when\nanother woman would have wept and pleaded. And it infused into her\nsoul something--it was cruel now to call it malice--which was still and\nwatchful and dangerous, which waited its opportunity, and then shot like\nan arrow from its bow out of the coil of brooding premeditation. Even\nthose who had never seen the white scars on Dick Venner's wrist,\nor heard the half-told story of her supposed attempt to do a graver\nmischief, knew well enough by looking at her that she was one of\nthe creatures not to be tampered with,--silent in anger and swift in\nvengeance.\n\nHelen could not return to the bedside at once after this communication.\nIt was with altered eyes that she must look on the poor girl, the victim\nof such an unheard-of fatality. All was explained to her now. But it\nopened such depths of solemn thought in her awakened consciousness, that\nit seemed as if the whole mystery of human life were coming up again\nbefore her for trial and judgment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif, while the\nwill lies sealed in its fountain, it may be poisoned at its very source,\nso that it shall flow dark and deadly through its whole course, who are\nwe that we should judge our fellow-creatures by ourselves?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then came\nthe terrible question, how far the elements themselves are capable\nof perverting the moral nature: if valor, and justice, and truth, the\nstrength of man and the virtue of woman, may not be poisoned out of a\nrace by the food of the Australian in his forest, by the foul air and\ndarkness of the Christians cooped up in the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctenement-houses\u00e2\u0080\u009d close by\nthose who live in the palaces of the great cities?\n\nShe walked out into the garden, lost in thought upon these dark and deep\nmatters. Presently she heard a step behind her, and Elsie's father came\nup and joined her. Since his introduction to Helen at the distinguished\ntea-party given by the Widow Rowens, and before her coming to sit with\nElsie, Mr. Dudley Venner had in the most accidental way in the world\nmet her on several occasions: once after church, when she happened to be\ncaught in a slight shower and he insisted on holding his umbrella\nover her on her way home;--once at a small party at one of the\nmansion-houses, where the quick-eyed lady of the house had a wonderful\nknack of bringing people together who liked to see each other;--perhaps\nat other times and places; but of this there is no certain evidence.\n\nThey naturally spoke of Elsie, her illness, and the aspect it had taken.\nBut Helen noticed in all that Dudley Venner said about his daughter a\nmorbid sensitiveness, as it seemed to her, an aversion to saying much\nabout her physical condition or her peculiarities,--a wish to feel\nand speak as a parent should, and yet a shrinking, as if there were\nsomething about Elsie which he could not bear to dwell upon. She thought\nshe saw through all this, and she could interpret it all charitably.\nThere were circumstances about his daughter which recalled the great\nsorrow of his life; it was not strange that this perpetual reminder\nshould in some degree have modified his feelings as a father. But what\na life he must have been leading for so many years, with this perpetual\nsource of distress which he could not name! Helen knew well enough, now,\nthe meaning of the sadness which had left such traces in his features\nand tones, and it made her feel very kindly and compassionate towards\nhim.\n\nSo they walked over the crackling leaves in the garden, between the\nlines of box breathing its fragrance of eternity;--for this is one of\nthe odors which carry us out of time into the abysses of the unbeginning\npast; if we ever lived on another ball of stone than this, it must be\nthat there was box growing on it. So they walked, finding their way\nsoftly to each other's sorrows and sympathies, each matching some\ncounterpart to the other's experience of life, and startled to see how\nthe different, yet parallel, lessons they had been taught by suffering\nhad led them step by step to the same serene acquiescence in the\norderings of that Supreme Wisdom which they both devoutly recognized.\n\nOld Sophy was at the window and saw them walking up and down the\ngarden-alleys. She watched them as her grandfather the savage watched\nthe figures that moved among the trees when a hostile tribe was lurking\nabout his mountain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere'll be a weddin' in the ol house,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbefore there's roses\non them bushes ag'in. But it won' be my poor Elsie's weddin', 'n' ol'\nSophy won' be there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen Helen prayed in the silence of her soul that evening, it was not\nthat Elsie's life might be spared. She dared not ask that as a favor of\nHeaven. What could life be to her but a perpetual anguish, and to those\nabout her but an ever-present terror? Might she but be so influenced\nby divine grace, that what in her was most truly human, most purely\nwoman-like, should overcome the dark, cold, unmentionable instinct which\nhad pervaded her being like a subtile poison that was all she could ask,\nand the rest she left to a higher wisdom and tenderer love than her own.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX. THE WHITE ASH.\n\nWhen Helen returned to Elsie's bedside, it was with a new and still\ndeeper feeling of sympathy, such as the story told by Old Sophy might\nwell awaken. She understood, as never before, the singular fascination\nand as singular repulsion which she had long felt in Elsie's presence.\nIt had not been without a great effort that she had forced herself to\nbecome the almost constant attendant of the sick girl; and now she was\nlearning, but not for the first time, the blessed truth which so many\ngood women have found out for themselves, that the hardest duty bravely\nperformed soon becomes a habit, and tends in due time to transform\nitself into a pleasure.\n\nThe old Doctor was beginning to look graver, in spite of himself. The\nfever, if such it was, went gently forward, wasting the young girl's\npowers of resistance from day to day; yet she showed no disposition\nto take nourishment, and seemed literally to be living on air. It was\nremarkable that with all this her look was almost natural, and her\nfeatures were hardly sharpened so as to suggest that her life was\nburning away. He did not like this, nor various other unobtrusive signs\nof danger which his practised eye detected. A very small matter might\nturn the balance which held life and death poised against each other.\nHe surrounded her with precautions, that Nature might have every\nopportunity of cunningly shifting the weights from the scale of death\nto the scale of life, as she will often do if not rudely disturbed or\ninterfered with.\n\nLittle tokens of good-will and kind remembrance were constantly coming\nto her from the girls in the school and the good people in the village.\nSome of the mansion-house people obtained rare flowers which they sent\nher, and her table was covered with fruits which tempted her in vain.\nSeveral of the school-girls wished to make her a basket of their own\nhandiwork, and, filling it with autumnal flowers, to send it as a joint\noffering. Mr. Bernard found out their project accidentally, and, wishing\nto have his share in it, brought home from one of his long walks some\nboughs full of variously tinted leaves, such as were still clinging\nto the stricken trees. With these he brought also some of the already\nfallen leaflets of the white ash, remarkable for their rich olive-purple\ncolor, forming a beautiful contrast with some of the lighter-hued\nleaves. It so happened that this particular tree, the white ash, did\nnot grow upon The Mountain, and the leaflets were more welcome for their\ncomparative rarity. So the girls made their basket, and the floor of it\nthey covered with the rich olive-purple leaflets. Such late flowers as\nthey could lay their hands upon served to fill it, and with many kindly\nmessages they sent it to Miss Elsie Venner at the Dudley mansion-house.\n\nElsie was sitting up in her bed when it came, languid, but tranquil, and\nHelen was by her, as usual, holding her hand, which was strangely cold,\nHelen thought, for one who was said to have some kind of fever. The\nschool-girls' basket was brought in with its messages of love and hopes\nfor speedy recovery. Old Sophy was delighted to see that it pleased\nElsie, and laid it on the bed before her. Elsie began looking at the\nflowers, and taking them from the basket, that she might see the leaves.\nAll at once she appeared to be agitated; she looked at the basket, then\naround, as if there were some fearful presence about her which she was\nsearching for with her eager glances. She took out the flowers, one\nby one, her breathing growing hurried, her eyes staring, her hands\ntrembling,--till, as she came near the bottom of the basket, she flung\nout all the rest with a hasty movement, looked upon the olive-purple\nleaflets as if paralyzed for a moment, shrunk up, as it were, into\nherself in a curdling terror, dashed the basket from her, and fell back\nsenseless, with a faint cry which chilled the blood of the startled\nlisteners at her bedside.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake it away!--take it away!--quick!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Old Sophy, as she hastened\nto her mistress's pillow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt 's the leaves of the tree that was always\ndeath to her,--take it away! She can't live wi' it in the room!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe poor old woman began chafing Elsie's hands, and Helen to try to\nrouse her with hartshorn, while a third frightened attendant gathered\nup the flowers and the basket and carried them out of the apartment, She\ncame to herself after a time, but exhausted and then wandering. In\nher delirium she talked constantly as if she were in a cave, with such\nexactness of circumstance that Helen could not doubt at all that she had\nsome such retreat among the rocks of The Mountain, probably fitted up\nin her own fantastic way, where she sometimes hid herself from all human\neyes, and of the entrance to which she alone possessed the secret.\n\nAll this passed away, and left her, of course, weaker than before. But\nthis was not the only influence the unexplained paroxysm had left behind\nit. From this time forward there was a change in her whole expression\nand her manner. The shadows ceased flitting over her features, and the\nold woman, who watched her from day to day and from hour to hour as a\nmother watches her child, saw the likeness she bore to her mother coming\nforth more and more, as the cold glitter died out of the diamond eyes,\nand the stormy scowl disappeared from the dark brows and low forehead.\n\nWith all the kindness and indulgence her father had bestowed upon her,\nElsie had never felt that he loved her. The reader knows well enough\nwhat fatal recollections and associations had frozen up the springs of\nnatural affection in his breast. There was nothing in the world he would\nnot do for Elsie. He had sacrificed his whole life to her. His very\nseeming carelessness about restraining her was all calculated; he knew\nthat restraint would produce nothing but utter alienation. Just so\nfar as she allowed him, he shared her studies, her few pleasures, her\nthoughts; but she was essentially solitary and uncommunicative. No\nperson, as was said long ago, could judge him, because his task was not\nmerely difficult, but simply impracticable to human powers. A nature\nlike Elsie's had necessarily to be studied by itself, and to be followed\nin its laws where it could not be led.\n\nEvery day, at different hours, during the whole of his daughter's\nillness, Dudley Venner had sat by her, doing all he could to soothe and\nplease her. Always the same thin film of some emotional non-conductor\nbetween them; always that kind of habitual regard and family-interest,\nmingled with the deepest pity on one side and a sort of respect on the\nother, which never warmed into outward evidences of affection.\n\nIt was after this occasion, when she had been so profoundly agitated\nby a seemingly insignificant cause, that her father and Old Sophy were\nsitting, one at one side of her bed and one at the other. She had fallen\ninto a light slumber. As they were looking at her, the same thought came\ninto both their minds at the same moment. Old Sophy spoke for both, as\nshe said, in a low voice,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt 's her mother's look,--it 's her mother's own face right over\nagain,--she never look' so before, the Lord's hand is on her! His will\nbe done!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen Elsie woke and lifted her languid eyes upon her father's face, she\nsaw in it a tenderness, a depth of affection, such as she remembered\nat rare moments of her childhood, when she had won him to her by some\nunusual gleam of sunshine in her fitful temper.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cElsie, dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe were thinking how much your expression was\nsometimes like that of your sweet mother. If you could but have seen\nher, so as to remember her!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe tender look and tone, the yearning of the daughter's heart for the\nmother she had never seen, save only with the unfixed, undistinguishing\neyes of earliest infancy, perhaps the under-thought that she might soon\nrejoin her in another state of being,--all came upon her with a sudden\noverflow of feeling which broke through all the barriers between her\nheart and her eyes, and Elsie wept. It seemed to her father as if the\nmalign influence--evil spirit it might almost be called--which had\npervaded her being, had at last been driven forth or exorcised, and that\nthese tears were at once the sign and the pledge of her redeemed nature.\nBut now she was to be soothed, and not excited. After her tears she\nslept again, and the look her face wore was peaceful as never before.\n\nOld Sophy met the Doctor at the door and told him all the circumstances\nconnected with the extraordinary attack from which Elsie had suffered.\nIt was the purple leaves, she said. She remembered that Dick once\nbrought home a branch of a tree with some of the same leaves on it, and\nElsie screamed and almost fainted then. She, Sophy, had asked her, after\nshe had got quiet, what it was in the leaves that made her feel so bad.\nElsie could n't tell her,--did n't like to speak about it,--shuddered\nwhenever Sophy mentioned it.\n\nThis did not sound so strangely to the old Doctor as it does to some\nwho listen to his narrative. He had known some curious examples of\nantipathies, and remembered reading of others still more singular.\nHe had known those who could not bear the presence of a cat, and\nrecollected the story, often told, of a person's hiding one in a chest\nwhen one of these sensitive individuals came into the room, so as not\nto disturb him; but he presently began to sweat and turn pale, and cried\nout that there must be a cat hid somewhere. He knew people who were\npoisoned by strawberries, by honey, by different meats, many who could\nnot endure cheese,--some who could not bear the smell of roses. If he\nhad known all the stories in the old books, he would have found that\nsome have swooned and become as dead men at the smell of a rose,--that\na stout soldier has been known to turn and run at the sight or smell of\nrue,--that cassia and even olive-oil have produced deadly faintings in\ncertain individuals,--in short, that almost everything has seemed to be\na poison to somebody.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBring me that basket, Sophy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old Doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you can find\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSophy brought it to him,--for he had not yet entered Elsie's apartment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese purple leaves are from the white ash,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don't know\nthe notion that people commonly have about that tree, Sophy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know they say the Ugly Things never go where the white ash grows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Sophy answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Doctor dear, what I'm thinkin' of a'n't true, is\nit?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Doctor smiled sadly, but did not answer. He went directly to Elsie's\nroom. Nobody would have known by his manner that he saw any special\nchange in his patient. He spoke with her as usual, made some slight\nalteration in his prescriptions, and left the room with a kind, cheerful\nlook. He met her father on the stairs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it as I thought?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dudley Veneer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is everything to fear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand not much, I am\nafraid, to hope. Does not her face recall to you one that you remember,\nas never before?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d her father answered,--\u00e2\u0080\u009coh, yes! What is the meaning of this\nchange which has come over her features, and her voice, her temper, her\nwhole being? Tell me, oh, tell me, what is it? Can it be that the curse\nis passing away, and my daughter is to be restored to me,--such as her\nmother would have had her,--such as her mother was?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWalk out with me into the garden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Doctor said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I will tell\nyou all I know and all I think about this great mystery of Elsie's\nlife.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey walked out together, and the Doctor began: \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has lived a double\nbeing, as it were,--the consequence of the blight which fell upon her\nin the dim period before consciousness. You can see what she might have\nbeen but for this. You know that for these eighteen years her whole\nexistence has taken its character from that influence which we need not\nname. But you will remember that few of the lower forms of life last as\nhuman beings do; and thus it might have been hoped and trusted with\nsome show of reason, as I have always suspected you hoped and trusted,\nperhaps more confidently than myself, that the lower nature which had\nbecome engrafted on the higher would die out and leave the real woman's\nlife she inherited to outlive this accidental principle which had so\npoisoned her childhood and youth. I believe it is so dying out; but I am\nafraid,--yes, I must say it, I fear it has involved the centres of\nlife in its own decay. There is hardly any pulse at Elsie's wrist;\nno stimulants seem to rouse her; and it looks as if life were slowly\nretreating inwards, so that by-and-by she will sleep as those who lie\ndown in the cold and never wake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nStrange as it may seem, her father heard all this not without deep\nsorrow, and such marks of it as his thoughtful and tranquil nature,\nlong schooled by suffering, claimed or permitted, but with a resignation\nitself the measure of his past trials. Dear as his daughter might become\nto him, all he dared to ask of Heaven was that she might be restored to\nthat truer self which lay beneath her false and adventitious being. If\nhe could once see that the icy lustre in her eyes had become a soft,\ncalm light,--that her soul was at peace with all about her and with Him;\nabove,--this crumb from the children's table was enough for him, as it\nwas for the Syro-Phoenician woman who asked that the dark spirit might\ngo out from her daughter.\n\nThere was little change the next day, until all at once she said in a\nclear voice that she should like to see her master at the school,\nMr. Langdon. He came accordingly, and took the place of Helen at her\nbedside. It seemed as if Elsie had forgotten the last scene with him.\nMight it be that pride had come in, and she had sent for him only to\nshow how superior she had grown to the weakness which had betrayed her\ninto that extraordinary request, so contrary to the instincts and usages\nof her sex? Or was it that the singular change which had come over her\nhad involved her passionate fancy for him and swept it away with her\nother habits of thought and feeling? Or could it be that she felt that\nall earthly interests were becoming of little account to her, and wished\nto place herself right with one to whom she had displayed a wayward\nmovement of her unbalanced imagination? She welcomed Mr. Bernard as\nquietly as she had received Helen Darley. He colored at the recollection\nof that last scene, when he came into her presence; but she smiled with\nperfect tranquillity. She did not speak to him of any apprehension; but\nhe saw that she looked upon herself as doomed. So friendly, yet so calm\ndid she seem through all their interview, that Mr. Bernard could only\nlook back upon her manifestation of feeling towards him on their walk\nfrom the school as a vagary of a mind laboring under some unnatural\nexcitement, and wholly at variance with the true character of Elsie\nVenner as he saw her before him in her subdued, yet singular beauty. He\nlooked with almost scientific closeness of observation into the diamond\neyes; but that peculiar light which he knew so well was not there. She\nwas the same in one sense as on that first day when he had seen her\ncoiling and uncoiling her golden chain; yet how different in every\naspect which revealed her state of mind and emotion! Something of\ntenderness there was, perhaps, in her tone towards him; she would not\nhave sent for him, had she not felt more than an ordinary interest in\nhim. But through the whole of his visit she never lost her gracious\nself-possession. The Dudley race might well be proud of the last of\nits daughters, as she lay dying, but unconquered by the feeling of the\npresent or the fear of the future.\n\nAs for Mr. Bernard, he found it very hard to look upon her, and\nlisten to her unmoved. There was nothing that reminded him of the\nstormy--browed, almost savage girl he remembered in her fierce\nloveliness,--nothing of all her singularities of air and of costume.\nNothing? Yes, one thing. Weak and suffering as she was, she had never\nparted with one particular ornament, such as a sick person would\nnaturally, as it might be supposed, get rid of at once. The golden cord\nwhich she wore round her neck at the great party was still there. A\nbracelet was lying by her pillow; she had unclasped it from her wrist.\n\nBefore Mr. Bernard left her, she said,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall never see you again. Some time or other, perhaps, you will\nmention my name to one whom you love. Give her this from your scholar\nand friend Elsie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe took the bracelet, raised her hand to his lips, then turned his face\naway; in that moment he was the weaker of the two.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-bye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthank you for coming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis voice died away in his throat, as he tried to answer her. She\nfollowed him with her eyes as he passed from her sight through the\ndoor, and when it closed after him sobbed tremulously once or twice,\nbut stilled herself, and met Helen, as she entered, with a composed\ncountenance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have had a very pleasant visit from Mr. Langdon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Elsie said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSit\nby me, Helen, awhile without speaking; I should like to sleep, if I\ncan,--and to dream.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX. THE GOLDEN CORD IS LOOSED.\n\nThe Reverend Chauncy Fairweather, hearing that his parishioner's\ndaughter, Elsie, was very ill, could do nothing less than come to the\nmansion-house and tender such consolations as he was master of. It was\nrather remarkable that the old Doctor did not exactly approve of his\nvisit. He thought that company of every sort might be injurious in\nher weak state. He was of opinion that Mr. Fairweather, though greatly\ninterested in religious matters, was not the most sympathetic person\nthat could be found; in fact, the old Doctor thought he was too much\ntaken up with his own interests for eternity to give himself quite 'so\nheartily to the need of other people as some persons got up on a rather\nmore generous scale (our good neighbor Dr. Honeywood, for instance)\ncould do. However, all these things had better be arranged to suit her\nwants; if she would like to talk with a clergyman, she had a great\ndeal better see one as often as she liked, and run the risk of the\nexcitement, than have a hidden wish for such a visit and perhaps find\nherself too weak to see him by-and-by.\n\nThe old Doctor knew by sad experience that dreadful mistake against\nwhich all medical practitioners should be warned. His experience may\nwell be a guide for others. Do not overlook the desire for spiritual\nadvice and consolation which patients sometimes feel, and, with the\nfrightful mauvaise honte peculiar to Protestantism, alone among all\nhuman beliefs, are ashamed to tell. As a part of medical treatment, it\nis the physician's business to detect the hidden longing for the food of\nthe soul, as much as for any form of bodily nourishment. Especially\nin the higher walks of society, where this unutterably miserable false\nshame of Protestantism acts in proportion to the general acuteness of\nthe cultivated sensibilities, let no unwillingness to suggest the sick\nperson's real need suffer him to languish between his want and his\nmorbid sensitiveness. What an infinite advantage the Mussulmans and the\nCatholics have over many of our more exclusively spiritual sects in the\nway they keep their religion always by them and never blush for it! And\nbesides this spiritual longing, we should never forget that\n\n          \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn some fond breast the parting soul relies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nand the minister of religion, in addition to the sympathetic nature\nwhich we have a right to demand in him, has trained himself to the art\nof entering into the feelings of others.\n\nThe reader must pardon this digression, which introduces the visit of\nthe Reverend Chauncy Fairweather to Elsie Veneer. It was mentioned\nto her that he would like to call and see how she was, and she\nconsented,--not with much apparent interest, for she had reasons of her\nown for not feeling any very deep conviction of his sympathy for persons\nin sorrow. But he came, and worked the conversation round to religion,\nand confused her with his hybrid notions, half made up of what he had\nbeen believing and teaching all his life, and half of the new doctrines\nwhich he had veneered upon the surface of his old belief. He got so\nfar as to make a prayer with her,--a cool, well-guarded prayer, which\ncompromised his faith as little as possible, and which, if devotion were\na game played against Providence, might have been considered a cautious\nand sagacious move.\n\nWhen he had gone, Elsie called Old Sophy to her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSophy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon't let them send that cold hearted man to me any\nmore. If your old minister comes--to see you, I should like to hear him\ntalk. He looks as if he cared for everybody, and would care for me. And,\nSophy, if I should die one of these days, I should like to have that old\nminister come and say whatever is to be said over me. It would comfort\nDudley more, I know, than to have that hard man here, when you're\nin trouble, for some of you will be sorry when I'm gone,--won't you,\nSophy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe poor old black woman could not stand this question. The cold\nminister had frozen Elsie until she felt as if nobody cared for her or\nwould regret her,--and her question had betrayed this momentary feeling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon' talk so! don' talk so, darlin'!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, passionately. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen\nyou go, Ol' Sophy'll go; 'n' where you go, Ol' Sophy'll go: 'n' we'll\nboth go t' th' place where th' Lord takes care of all his children,\nwhether their faces are white or black. Oh, darlin', darlin'! if th'\nLord should let me die firs', you shall fin' all ready for you when you\ncome after me. On'y don' go 'n' leave poor Ol' Sophy all 'lone in th'\nworld!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelen came in at this moment and quieted the old woman with a look. Such\nscenes were just what were most dangerous, in the state in which Elsie\nwas lying: but that is one of the ways in which an affectionate friend\nsometimes unconsciously wears out the life which a hired nurse, thinking\nof nothing but her regular duties and her wages, would have spared from\nall emotional fatigue.\n\nThe change which had come over Elsie's disposition was itself the cause\nof new excitements. How was it possible that her father could keep away\nfrom her, now that she was coming back to the nature and the very look\nof her mother, the bride of his youth? How was it possible to refuse\nher, when she said to Old Sophy, that she should like to have her\nminister come in and sit by her, even though his presence might perhaps\nprove a new source of excitement?\n\nBut the Reverend Doctor did come and sit by her, and spoke such soothing\nwords to her, words of such peace and consolation, that from that hour\nshe was tranquil as never before. All true hearts are alike in the\nhour of need; the Catholic has a reserved fund of faith for his\nfellow-creature's trying moment, and the Calvinist reveals those springs\nof human brotherhood and charity in his soul which are only covered over\nby the iron tables inscribed with the harder dogmas of his creed. It was\nenough that the Reverend Doctor knew all Elsie's history. He could not\njudge her by any formula, like those which have been moulded by past\nages out of their ignorance. He did not talk with her as if she were an\noutside sinner worse than himself. He found a bruised and languishing\nsoul, and bound up its wounds. A blessed office,--one which is confined\nto no sect or creed, but which good men in all times, under various\nnames and with varying ministries, to suit the need of each age, of each\nrace, of each individual soul, have come forward to discharge for their\nsuffering fellow-creatures.\n\nAfter this there was little change in Elsie, except that her heart beat\nmore feebly every day,--so that the old Doctor himself, with all his\nexperience, could see nothing to account for the gradual failing of the\npowers of life, and yet could find no remedy which seemed to arrest its\nprogress in the smallest degree.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe very careful,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat she is not allowed to make any\nmuscular exertion. Any such effort, when a person is so enfeebled, may\nstop the heart in a moment; and if it stops, it will never move again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelen enforced this rule with the greatest care. Elsie was hardly\nallowed to move her hand or to speak above a whisper. It seemed to be\nmainly the question now, whether this trembling flame of life would be\nblown out by some light breath of air, or whether it could be so nursed\nand sheltered by the hollow of these watchful hands that it would have a\nchance to kindle to its natural brightness.\n\n--Her father came in to sit with her in the evening. He had never talked\nso freely with her as during the hour he had passed at her bedside,\ntelling her little circumstances of her mother's life, living over with\nher all that was pleasant in the past, and trying to encourage her with\nsome cheerful gleams of hope for the future. A faint smile played over\nher face, but she did not answer his encouraging suggestions. The hour\ncame for him to leave her with those who watched by her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-night, my dear child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, and stooping down, kissed her\ncheek.\n\nElsie rose by a sudden effort, threw her arms round his neck, kissed\nhim, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-night, my dear father!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe suddenness of her movement had taken him by surprise, or he would\nhave checked so dangerous an effort. It was too late now. Her arms\nslid away from him like lifeless weights,--her head fell back upon her\npillow,--along sigh breathed through her lips.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is faint,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Helen, doubtfully; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbring me the hartshorn, Sophy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old woman had started from her place, and was now leaning over her,\nlooking in her face, and listening for the sound of her breathing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe 's dead! Elsie 's dead! My darlin 's dead!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried aloud,\nfilling the room with her utterance of anguish.\n\nDudley Venner drew her away and silenced her with a voice of authority,\nwhile Helen and an assistant plied their restoratives. It was all in\nvain.\n\nThe solemn tidings passed from the chamber of death through the family.\nThe daughter, the hope of that old and honored house, was dead in the\nfreshness of her youth, and the home of its solitary representative was\nhereafter doubly desolate.\n\nA messenger rode hastily out of the avenue. A little after this the\npeople of the village and the outlying farm-houses were startled by the\nsound of a bell.\n\nOne,--two,--three,--four,\n\nThey stopped in every house, as far as the wavering vibrations reached,\nand listened--\n\nfive,--six,--seven,--\n\nIt was not the little child which had been lying so long at the point of\ndeath; that could not be more than three or four years old--\n\neight,--nine,--ten,--and so on to fifteen, sixteen,--seventeen,\n--eighteen--\n\nThe pulsations seemed to keep on,--but it was the brain, and not the\nbell, that was throbbing now.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cElsie 's dead!\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the exclamation at a hundred firesides.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEighteen year old,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said old Widow Peake, rising from her chair.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEighteen year ago I laid two gold eagles on her mother's eyes,--he\nwouldn't have anything but gold touch her eyelids,--and now Elsie's to\nbe straightened,--the Lord have mercy on her poor sinful soul!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDudley Venner prayed that night that he might be forgiven, if he had\nfailed in any act of duty or kindness to this unfortunate child of his,\nnow freed from all the woes born with her and so long poisoning her\nsoul. He thanked God for the brief interval of peace which had been\ngranted her, for the sweet communion they had enjoyed in these last\ndays, and for the hope of meeting her with that other lost friend in a\nbetter world.\n\nHelen mingled a few broken thanks and petitions with her tears: thanks\nthat she had been permitted to share the last days and hours of this\npoor sister in sorrow; petitions that the grief of bereavement might be\nlightened to the lonely parent and the faithful old servant.\n\nOld Sophy said almost nothing, but sat day and night by her dead\ndarling. But sometimes her anguish would find an outlet in strange\nsounds, something between a cry and a musical note,--such as noise had\never heard her utter before. These were old remembrances surging up from\nher childish days, coming through her mother from the cannibal chief,\nher grandfather,--death-wails, such as they sing in the mountains of\nWestern Africa, when they see the fires on distant hill-sides and know\nthat their own wives and children are undergoing the fate of captives.\n\nThe time came when Elsie was to be laid by her mother in the small\nsquare marked by the white stone.\n\nIt was not unwillingly that the Reverend Chauncy Fairweather had\nrelinquished the duty of conducting the service to the Reverend Doctor\nHoneywood, in accordance with Elsie's request. He could not, by any\nreasoning, reconcile his present way of thinking with a hope for the\nfuture of his unfortunate parishioner. Any good old Roman Catholic\npriest, born and bred to his faith and his business, would have found a\nloophole into some kind of heaven for her, by virtue of his doctrine of\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cinvincible ignorance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or other special proviso; but a recent convert\ncannot enter into the working conditions of his new creed. Beliefs must\nbe lived in for a good while, before they accommodate themselves to the\nsoul's wants, and wear loose enough to be comfortable.\n\nThe Reverend Doctor had no such scruples. Like thousands of those who\nare classed nominally with the despairing believers, he had never prayed\nover a departed brother or sister without feeling and expressing a\nguarded hope that there was mercy in store for the poor sinner, whom\nparents, wives, children, brothers and sisters could not bear to give up\nto utter ruin without a word,--and would not, as he knew full well,\nin virtue of that human love and sympathy which nothing can ever\nextinguish. And in this poor Elsie's history he could read nothing\nwhich the tears of the recording angel might not wash away. As the good\nphysician of the place knew the diseases that assailed the bodies of men\nand women, so he had learned the mysteries of the sickness of the soul.\n\nSo many wished to look upon Elsie's face once more, that her father\nwould not deny them; nay, he was pleased that those who remembered her\nliving should see her in the still beauty of death. Helen and those with\nher arrayed her for this farewell-view. All was ready for the sad or\ncurious eyes which were to look upon her. There 'was no painful change\nto be concealed by any artifice. Even her round neck was left uncovered,\nthat she might be more like one who slept. Only the golden cord was left\nin its place: some searching eye might detect a trace of that birthmark\nwhich it was whispered she had always worn a necklace to conceal.\n\nAt the last moment, when all the preparations were completed, Old Sophy\nstooped over her, and, with trembling hand, loosed the golden cord. She\nlooked intently; for some little space: there was no shade nor blemish\nwhere the ring of gold had encircled her throat. She took it gently away\nand laid it in the casket which held her ornaments.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Lord be praised!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the old woman cried, aloud. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has taken away\nthe mark that was on her; she's fit to meet his holy angels now!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo Elsie lay for hours in the great room, in a kind of state, with\nflowers all about her,--her black hair braided as in life,--her brows\nsmooth, as if they had never known the scowl of passion,--and on her\nlips the faint smile with which she had uttered her last \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood--night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n The young girls from the school looked at her, one after another, and\npassed on, sobbing, carrying in their hearts the picture that would be\nwith them all their days. The great people of the place were all there\nwith their silent sympathy. The lesser kind of gentry, and many of the\nplainer folk of the village, half-pleased to find themselves passing\nbeneath the stately portico of the ancient mansion-house, crowded\nin, until the ample rooms were overflowing. All the friends whose\nacquaintance we have made were there, and many from remoter villages and\ntowns.\n\nThere was a deep silence at last. The hour had come for the parting\nwords to be spoken over the dead. The good old minister's voice rose out\nof the stillness, subdued and tremulous at first, but growing firmer\nand clearer as he went on, until it reached the ears of the visitors who\nwere in the far, desolate chambers, looking at the pictured hangings\nand the old dusty portraits. He did not tell her story in his prayer. He\nonly spoke of our dear departed sister as one of many whom Providence\nin its wisdom has seen fit to bring under bondage from their cradles. It\nwas not for us to judge them by any standard of our own. He who made the\nheart alone knew the infirmities it inherited or acquired. For all that\nour dear sister had presented that was interesting and attractive in her\ncharacter we were to be grateful; for whatever was dark or inexplicable\nwe must trust that the deep shadow which rested on the twilight dawn of\nher being might render a reason before the bar of Omniscience; for the\ngrace which had lightened her last days we should pour out our hearts\nin thankful acknowledgment. From the life and the death of this our dear\nsister we should learn a lesson of patience with our fellow-creatures in\ntheir inborn peculiarities, of charity in judging what seem to us wilful\nfaults of character, of hope and trust, that, by sickness or affliction,\nor such inevitable discipline as life must always bring with it, if by\nno gentler means, the soul which had been left by Nature to wander into\nthe path of error and of suffering might be reclaimed and restored to\nits true aim, and so led on by divine grace to its eternal welfare. He\nclosed his prayer by commending each member of the afflicted family to\nthe divine blessing.\n\nThen all at once rose the clear sound of the girls' voices, in the\nsweet, sad melody of a funeral hymn,--one of those which Elsie had\nmarked, as if prophetically, among her own favorites.\n\nAnd so they laid her in the earth, and showered down flowers upon her,\nand filled her grave, and covered it with green sods. By the side of it\nwas another oblong ridge, with a white stone standing at its head. Mr.\nBernard looked upon it, as he came close to the place where Elsie was\nlaid, and read the inscription,\n\n                         CATALINA\n\n                  WIFE TO DUDLEY VENNER\n\n                          DIED\n                    OCTOBER 13TH 1840\n\n                      AGED XX YEARS\n\nA gentle rain fell on the turf after it was laid. This was the beginning\nof a long and dreary autumnal storm, a deferred \u00e2\u0080\u009cequinoctial,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as many\nconsidered it. The mountain streams were all swollen and turbulent, and\nthe steep declivities were furrowed in every direction by new channels.\nIt made the house seem doubly desolate to hear the wind howling and the\nrain beating upon the roofs. The poor relation who was staying at the\nhouse would insist on Helen's remaining a few days: Old Sophy was in\nsuch a condition, that it kept her in continual anxiety, and there were\nmany cares which Helen could take off from her.\n\nThe old black woman's life was buried in her darling's grave. She did\nnothing but moan and lament for her. At night she was restless, and\nwould get up and wander to Elsie's apartment and look for her and call\nher by name. At other times she would lie awake and listen to the wind\nand the rain,--sometimes with such a wild look upon her face, and with\nsuch sudden starts and exclamations, that it seemed as if she heard\nspirit-voices and were answering the whispers of unseen visitants. With\nall this were mingled hints of her old superstition,--forebodings of\nsomething fearful about to happen,--perhaps the great final catastrophe\nof all things, according to the prediction current in the kitchens of\nRockland.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHark!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Old Sophy would say,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cdon' you hear th' crackin' 'n' th'\nsnappin' up in Th' Mountain, 'n' th' rollin' o' th' big stones? The' 's\nsomethin' stirrin' among th' rocks; I hear th' soun' of it in th' night,\nwhen th' wind has stopped blowin'. Oh, stay by me a little while, Miss\nDarlin'! stay by me! for it's th' Las' Day, maybe, that's close on us,\n'n' I feel as if I could n' meet th' Lord all alone!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was curious,--but Helen did certainly recognize sounds, during\nthe lull of the storm, which were not of falling rain or running\nstreams,--short snapping sounds, as of tense cords breaking,--long\nuneven sounds, as of masses rolling down steep declivities. But the\nmorning came as usual; and as the others said nothing of these singular\nnoises, Helen did not think it necessary to speak of them. All day long\nshe and the humble relative of Elsie's mother, who had appeared as\npoor relations are wont to in the great prises of life, were busy in\narranging the disordered house, and looking over the various objects\nwhich Elsie's singular tastes had brought together, to dispose of them\nas her father might direct. They all met together at the usual hour for\ntea. One of the servants came in, looking very blank, and said to the\npoor relation,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe well is gone dry; we have nothing but rainwater.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDudley Venner's countenance changed; he sprang to, his feet and went\nto--assure himself of the fact, and, if he could, of the reason of it.\nFor a well to dry up during such a rain-storm was extraordinary,--it was\nominous.\n\nHe came back, looking very anxious.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid any of you notice any remarkable sounds last night,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cor\nthis morning? Hark! do you hear anything now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey listened in perfect silence for a few moments. Then there came a\nshort cracking sound, and two or three snaps, as of parting cords.\n\nDudley Venner called all his household together.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are in danger here, as I think, to-night,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cnot very great\ndanger, perhaps, but it is a risk I do not wish you to run. These heavy\nrains have loosed some of the rocks above, and they may come down and\nendanger the house. Harness the horses, Elbridge, and take all the\nfamily away. Miss Darley will go to the Institute; the others will pass\nthe night at the Mountain House. I shall stay here, myself: it is not\nat all likely that anything will come of these warnings; but if there\nshould, I choose to be there and take my chance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt needs little, generally, to frighten servants, and they were all\nready enough to go. The poor relation was one of the timid sort, and was\nterribly uneasy to be got out of the house. This left no alternative, of\ncourse, for Helen, but to go also. They all urged upon Dudley Veneer to\ngo with them: if there was danger, why should he remain to risk it, when\nhe sent away the others?\n\nOld Sophy said nothing until the time came for her to go with the second\nof Elbridge's carriage-loads.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, Sophy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dudley Veneer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cget your things and go. They will\ntake good care of you at the Mountain House; and when we have made sure\nthat there is no real danger, you shall come back at once.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, Masse!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sophy answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI've seen Elsie into th' ground, 'n' I\na'n't goin' away to come back 'n' fin' Masse Veneer buried under th'\nrocks. My darlin' 's gone; 'n' now, if Masse goes, 'n' th' of place\ngoes, it's time for Ol' Sophy to go, too. No, Masse Veneer, we'll both\nstay in th' of mansion 'n' wait for th' Lord!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNothing could change the old woman's determination; and her master, who\nonly feared, but did not really expect the long-deferred catastrophe,\nwas obliged to consent to her staying. The sudden drying of the well at\nsuch a time was the most alarming sign; for he remembered that the same\nthing had been observed just before great mountain-slides. This long\nrain, too, was just the kind of cause which was likely to loosen the\nstrata of rock piled up in the ledges; if the dreaded event should ever\ncome to pass, it would be at such a time.\n\nHe paced his chamber uneasily until long past midnight. If the morning\ncame without accident, he meant to have a careful examination made of\nall the rents and fissures above, of their direction and extent, and\nespecially whether, in case of a mountain-slide, the huge masses would\nbe like to reach so far to the east and so low down the declivity as the\nmansion.\n\nAt two o'clock in the morning he was dozing in his chair. Old Sophy had\nlain down on her bed, and was muttering in troubled dreams.\n\nAll at once a loud crash seemed to rend the very heavens above them: a\ncrack as of the thunder that follows close upon the bolt,--a rending and\ncrashing as of a forest snapped through all its stems, torn, twisted,\nsplintered, dragged with all its ragged boughs into one chaotic ruin.\nThe ground trembled under them as in an earthquake; the old mansion\nshuddered so that all its windows chattered in their casements; the\ngreat chimney shook off its heavy cap-stones, which came down on the\nroof with resounding concussions; and the echoes of The Mountain roared\nand bellowed in long reduplication, as if its whole foundations were\nrent, and this were the terrible voice of its dissolution.\n\nDudley Venner rose from his chair, folded his arms, and awaited his\nfate. There was no knowing where to look for safety; and he remembered\ntoo well the story of the family that was lost by rushing out of the\nhouse, and so hurrying into the very jaws of death.\n\nHe had stood thus but for a moment, when he heard the voice of Old Sophy\nin a wild cry of terror:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's th' Las' Day! It's th' Las' Day! The Lord is comin' to take us\nall!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSophy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he called; but she did not hear him or heed him, and rushed out\nof the house.\n\nThe worst danger was over. If they were to be destroyed, it would\nnecessarily be in a few seconds from the first thrill of the terrible\nconvulsion. He waited in awful suspense, but calm. Not more than one or\ntwo minutes could have passed before the frightful tumult and all its\nsounding echoes had ceased. He called Old Sophy; but she did not answer.\nHe went to the western window and looked forth into the darkness. He\ncould not distinguish the outlines of the landscape, but the white stone\nwas clearly visible, and by its side the new-made mound. Nay, what was\nthat which obscured its outline, in shape like a human figure? He flung\nopen the window and sprang through. It was all that there was left of\npoor Old Sophy, stretched out lifeless, upon her darling's grave.\n\nHe had scarcely composed her limbs and drawn the sheet over her, when\nthe neighbors began to arrive from all directions. Each was expecting\nto hear of houses overwhelmed and families destroyed; but each came with\nthe story that his own household was safe. It was not until the morning\ndawned that the true nature and extent of the sudden movement was\nascertained. A great seam had opened above the long cliff, and the\nterrible Rattlesnake Ledge, with all its envenomed reptiles, its\ndark fissures and black caverns, was buried forever beneath a mighty\nincumbent mass of ruin.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI. MR. SILAS PECKHAM RENDERS HIS ACCOUNT.\n\nThe morning rose clear and bright. The long storm was over, and the calm\nautumnal sunshine was now to return, with all its infinite repose and\nsweetness. With the earliest dawn exploring parties were out in every\ndirection along the southern slope of The Mountain, tracing the ravages\nof the great slide and the track it had followed. It proved to be not\nso much a slide as the breaking off and falling of a vast line of cliff,\nincluding the dreaded Ledge. It had folded over like the leaves of a\nhalf-opened book when they close, crushing the trees below, piling its\nruins in a glacis at the foot of what had been the overhanging wall of\nthe cliff, and filling up that deep cavity above the mansion-house which\nbore the ill-omened name of Dead Man's Hollow. This it was which had\nsaved the Dudley mansion. The falling masses, or huge fragments\nbreaking off from them, would have swept the house and all around it to\ndestruction but for this deep shelving dell, into which the stream of\nruin was happily directed. It was, indeed, one of Nature's conservative\nrevolutions; for the fallen masses made a kind oz shelf, which\ninterposed a level break between the inclined planes above and below it,\nso that the nightmare-fancies of the dwellers in the Dudley mansion, and\nin many other residences under the shadow of The Mountain, need not keep\nthem lying awake hereafter to listen for the snapping of roots and the\nsplitting of the rocks above them.\n\nTwenty-four hours after the falling of the cliff, it seemed as if it had\nhappened ages ago. The new fact had fitted itself in with all the old\npredictions, forebodings, fears, and acquired the solidarity belonging\nto all events which have slipped out of the fingers of Time and\ndissolved in the antecedent eternity.\n\nOld Sophy was lying dead in the Dudley mansion. If there were tears shed\nfor her, they could not be bitter ones; for she had lived out her full\nmeasure of days, and gone--who could help fondly believing it?--to\nrejoin her beloved mistress. They made a place for her at the foot of\nthe two mounds. It was thus she would have chosen to sleep, and not to\nhave wronged her humble devotion in life by asking to lie at the side\nof those whom she had served so long and faithfully. There were very few\npresent at the simple ceremony. Helen Darley was one of these few. The\nold black woman had been her companion in all the kind offices of which\nshe had been the ministering angel to Elsie.\n\nAfter it was all over, Helen was leaving with the rest, when Dudley\nVeneer begged her to stay a little, and he would send her back: it was\na long walk; besides, he wished to say some things to her, which he had\nnot had the opportunity of speaking. Of course Helen could not refuse\nhim; there must be many thoughts coming into his mind which he would\nwish to share with her who had known his daughter so long and been with\nfiler in her last days.\n\nShe returned into the great parlor with the wrought cornices and the\nmedallion-portraits on the ceiling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am now alone in the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dudley Veneer said.\n\nHelen must have known that before he spoke. But the tone in which he\nsaid it had so much meaning, that she could not find a word to answer\nhim with. They sat in silence, which the old tall clock counted out in\nlong seconds; but it was silence which meant more than any words they\nhad ever spoken.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlone in the world. Helen, the freshness of my life is gone, and there\nis little left of the few graces which in my younger days might have\nfitted me to win the love of women. Listen to me,--kindly, if you can;\nforgive me, at least. Half my life has been passed in constant fear and\nanguish, without any near friend to share my trials. My task is done\nnow; my fears have ceased to prey upon me; the sharpness of early\nsorrows has yielded something of its edge to time. You have bound me\nto you by gratitude in the tender care you have taken of my poor child.\nMore than this. I must tell you all now, out of the depth of this\ntrouble through which I am passing. I have loved you from the moment\nwe first met; and if my life has anything left worth accepting, it is\nyours. Will you take the offered gift?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelen looked in his face, surprised, bewildered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is not for me,--not for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am but a poor faded\nflower, not worth the gathering, of such a one as you. No, no,--I have\nbeen bred to humble toil all my days, and I could not be to you what\nyou ought to ask. I am accustomed to a kind of loneliness and\nself-dependence. I have seen nothing, almost, of the world, such as you\nwere born to move in. Leave me to my obscure place and duties; I shall\nat least have peace;--and you--you will surely find in due time some one\nbetter fitted by Nature and training to make you happy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, Miss Darley!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dudley Venner said, almost sternly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must not\nspeak to a man, who has lived through my experiences, of looking about\nfor a new choice after his heart has once chosen. Say that you can never\nlove me; say that I have lived too long to share your young life; say\nthat sorrow has left nothing in me for Love to find his pleasure in; but\ndo not mock me with the hope of a new affection for some unknown object.\nThe first look of yours brought me to your side. The first tone of your\nvoice sunk into my heart. From this moment my life must wither out or\nbloom anew. My home is desolate. Come under my roof and make it bright\nonce more,--share my life with me,--or I shall give the halls of the old\nmansion to the bats and the owls, and wander forth alone without a hope\nor a friend!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTo find herself with a man's future at the disposal of a single word of\nhers!--a man like this, too, with a fascination for her against which\nshe had tried to shut her heart, feeling that he lived in another sphere\nthan hers, working as she was for her bread a poor operative in the\nfactory of a hard master and jealous overseer, the salaried drudge of\nMr. Silas Peckham! Why, she had thought he was grateful to her as a\nfriend of his daughter; she had even pleased herself with the feeling\nthat he liked her, in her humble place, as a woman of some cultivation\nand many sympathetic points of relation with himself; but that he loved\nher,--that this deep, fine nature, in a man so far removed from her in\noutward circumstance, should have found its counterpart in one whom life\nhad treated so coldly as herself,--that Dudley Venner should stake\nhis happiness on a breath of hers,--poor Helen Darley's,--it was all a\nsurprise, a confusion, a kind of fear not wholly fearful. Ah, me! women\nknow what it is, that mist over the eyes, that trembling in the\nlimbs, that faltering of the voice, that sweet, shame-faced, unspoken\nconfession of weakness which does not wish to be strong, that sudden\noverflow in the soul where thoughts loose their hold on each other and\nswim single and helpless in the flood of emotion,--women know what it\nis!\n\nNo doubt she was a little frightened and a good deal bewildered, and\nthat her sympathies were warmly excited for a friend to whom she had\nbeen brought so near, and whose loneliness she saw and pitied. She lost\nthat calm self-possession she had hoped to maintain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I thought that I could make you happy,--if I should speak from my\nheart, and not my reason,--I am but a weak woman,--yet if I can be to\nyou--What can I say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhat more could this poor, dear Helen say?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cElbridge, harness the horses and take Miss Darley back to the school.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhat conversation had taken place since Helen's rhetorical failure is\nnot recorded in the minutes from which this narrative is constructed.\nBut when the man who had been summoned had gone to get the carriage\nready, Helen resumed something she had been speaking of.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot for the world. Everything must go on just as it has gone on, for\nthe present. There are proprieties to be consulted. I cannot be hard\nwith you, that out of your very affliction has sprung this--this\nwell--you must name it for me,--but the world will never listen to\nexplanations. I am to be Helen Darley, lady assistant in Mr. Silas\nPeckham's school, as long as I see fit to hold my office. And I mean to\nattend to my scholars just as before; so that I shall have very little\ntime for visiting or seeing company. I believe, though, you are one of\nthe Trustees and a Member of the Examining Committee; so that, if you\nshould happen to visit the school, I shall try to be civil to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEvery lady sees, of course, that Helen was quite right; but perhaps here\nand there one will think that Dudley Venner was all wrong,--that he was\ntoo hasty,--that he should have been too full of his recent grief for\nsuch a confession as he has just made, and the passion from which it\nsprung. Perhaps they do not understand the sudden recoil of a strong\nnature long compressed. Perhaps they have not studied the mystery\nof allotropism in the emotions of the human heart. Go to the nearest\nchemist and ask him to show you some of the dark-red phosphorus which\nwill not burn without fierce heating, but at 500 deg. Fahrenheit,\nchanges back again to the inflammable substance we know so well. Grief\nseems more like ashes than like fire; but as grief has been love once,\nso it may become love again. This is emotional allotropism.\n\nHelen rode back to the Institute and inquired for Mr. Peckham. She had\nnot seen him during the brief interval between her departure from the\nmansion-house and her return to Old Sophy's funeral. There were various\nquestions about the school she wished to ask.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, how's your haalth, Miss Darley?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Silas began. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe've missed you\nconsid'able. Glad to see you back at the post of dooty. Hope the Squire\ntreated you hahnsomely,--liberal pecooniary compensation,--hey? A'n't\nmuch of a loser, I guess, by acceptin' his propositions?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelen blushed at this last question, as if Silas had meant something by\nit beyond asking what money she had received; but his own double-meaning\nexpression and her blush were too nice points for him to have taken\ncognizance of. He was engaged in a mental calculation as to the amount\nof the deduction he should make under the head of \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemage to the\ninstitootion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--this depending somewhat on that of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpecooniary\ncompensation\u00e2\u0080\u009d she might have received for her services as the friend of\nElsie Venner.\n\nSo Helen slid back at once into her routine, the same faithful, patient\ncreature she had always been. But what was this new light which seemed\nto have kindled in her eyes? What was this look of peace, which nothing\ncould disturb, which smiled serenely through all the little meannesses\nwith which the daily life of the educational factory surrounded her,\nwhich not only made her seem resigned, but overflowed all her features\nwith a thoughtful, subdued happiness? Mr. Bernard did not know,--perhaps\nhe did not guess. The inmates of the Dudley mansion were not scandalized\nby any mysterious visits of a veiled or unveiled lady. The vibrating\ntongues of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfemale youth\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the Institute were not set in motion by\nthe standing of an equipage at the gate, waiting for their lady-teacher.\nThe servants at the mansion did not convey numerous letters with\nsuperscriptions in a bold, manly hand, sealed with the arms of a\nwell-known house, and directed to Miss Helen Darley; nor, on the other\nhand, did Hiram, the man from the lean streak in New Hampshire,\ncarry sweet-smelling, rose-hued, many-layered, criss-crossed,\nfine-stitch-lettered packages of note-paper directed to Dudley Venner,\nEsq., and all too scanty to hold that incredible expansion of the famous\nthree words which a woman was born to say,--that perpetual miracle which\nastonishes all the go-betweens who wear their shoes out in carrying a\nwoman's infinite variations on the theme--\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cI love you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the reader must remember that there are walks in country-towns where\npeople are liable to meet by accident, and that the hollow of an old\ntree has served the purpose of a post-office sometimes; so that he has\nher choice (to divide the pronouns impartially) of various hypotheses to\naccount for the new glory of happiness which seemed to have irradiated\nour poor Helen's features, as if her dreary life were awakening in the\ndawn of a blessed future.\n\nWith all the alleviations which have been hinted at, Mr. Dudley Venner\nthought that the days and the weeks had never moved so slowly as\nthrough the last period of the autumn that was passing. Elsie had been a\nperpetual source of anxiety to him, but still she had been a companion.\nHe could not mourn for her; for he felt that she was safer with her\nmother, in that world where there are no more sorrows and dangers, than\nshe could have been with him. But as he sat at his window and looked at\nthe three mounds, the loneliness of the great house made it seem more\nlike the sepulchre than these narrow dwellings where his beloved and her\ndaughter lay close to each other, side by side,--Catalina, the bride\nof his youth, and Elsie, the child whom he had nurtured, with poor Old\nSophy, who had followed them like a black shadow, at their feet, under\nthe same soft turf, sprinkled with the brown autumnal leaves. It was not\ngood for him to be thus alone. How should he ever live through the long\nmonths of November and December?\n\nThe months of November and December did, in some way or other, get\nrid of themselves at last, bringing with them the usual events of\nvillage-life and a few unusual ones. Some of the geologists had been\nup to look at the great slide, of which they gave those prolix accounts\nwhich everybody remembers who read the scientific journals of the time.\nThe engineers reported that there was little probability of any further\nconvulsion along the line of rocks which overhung the more thickly\nsettled part of the town. The naturalists drew up a paper on the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cProbable Extinction of the Crotalus Durissus in the Township of\nRockland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The engagement of the Widow Rowens to a Little Millionville\nmerchant was announced,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cSudding 'n' onexpected,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Widow Leech\nsaid,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cwaalthy, or she wouldn't ha' looked at him,--fifty year old,\nif he is a day, 'n' hu'n't got a white hair in his head.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Reverend\nChauncy Fairweather had publicly announced that he was going to join the\nRoman Catholic communion,--not so much to the surprise or consternation\nof the religious world as he had supposed. Several old ladies forthwith\nproclaimed their intention of following him; but, as one or two of them\nwere deaf, and another had been threatened with an attack of that mild,\nbut obstinate complaint, dementia senilis, many thought it was not so\nmuch the force of his arguments as a kind of tendency to jump as the\nbellwether jumps, well known in flocks not included in the Christian\nfold. His bereaved congregation immediately began pulling candidates on\nand off, like new boots, on trial. Some pinched in tender places; some\nwere too loose; some were too square-toed; some were too coarse, and\ndid n't please; some were too thin, and would n't last;--in short, they\ncould n't possibly find a fit. At last, people began to drop in to hear\nold Doctor Honeywood. They were quite surprised to find what a human old\ngentleman he was, and went back and told the others, that, instead of\nbeing a case of confluent sectarianism, as they supposed, the good old\nminister had been so well vaccinated with charitable virus that he was\nnow a true, open-souled Christian of the mildest type. The end of all\nwhich was, that the liberal people went over to the old minister almost\nin a body, just at the time that Deacon Shearer and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cVinegar-Bible\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n party split off, and that not long afterwards they sold their own\nmeeting-house to the malecontents, so that Deacon Soper used often to\nremind Colonel Sprowle of his wish that \u00e2\u0080\u009cour little man and him [the\nReverend Doctor] would swop pulpits,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and tell him it had \u00e2\u0080\u009cpooty nigh\ncome trew.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--But this is anticipating the course of events, which were\nmuch longer in coming about; for we have but just got through that\nterrible long month, as Mr. Dudley Venner found it, of December.\n\nOn the first of January, Mr. Silas Peckham was in the habit of settling\nhis quarterly accounts, and making such new arrangements as his\nconvenience or interest dictated. New Year was a holiday at the\nInstitute. No doubt this accounted for Helen's being dressed so\ncharmingly,--always, to be sure in, her own simple way, but yet with\nsuch a true lady's air, that she looked fit to be the mistress of any\nmansion in the land.\n\nShe was in the parlor alone, a little before noon, when Mr. Peckham came\nin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm ready to settle my accaount with you now, Miss Darley,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Silas.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs you please, Mr. Peckham,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helen answered, very graciously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBefore payin' you your selary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Principal continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish to\ncome to an understandin' as to the futur'. I consider that I've been\npayin' high, very high, for the work you do. Women's wages can't be\nexpected to do more than feed and clothe 'em, as a gineral thing, with\na little savin', in case of sickness, and to bury 'em, if they\nbreak daown, as all of 'em are liable to do at any time. If I a'n't\nmisinformed, you not only support yourself out of my establishment, but\nlikewise relatives of yours, who I don't know that I'm called upon to\nfeed and clothe. There is a young woman, not burdened with destitute\nrelatives, has signified that she would be glad to take your dooties\nfor less pecooniary compensation, by a consid'able amaount, than you now\nreceive.

She could not quite make up\nher mind to touch the feverish bills with the cankering coppers in them,\nand left them airing themselves on the table.\n\nThe document she held ran as follows:\n\nSilas Peckham, Esq., Principal of the Apollinean Institute, In Account\nwith Helen Darley, Assist.

So, when she\nlooked over this account of Mr. Silas Peckham's, and saw that he had\ncontrived to pare down her salary to something less than half its\nstipulated amount, the look which her countenance wore was as near to\nthat of righteous indignation as her gentle features and soft blue eyes\nwould admit of its being.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Mr. Peckham,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo you mean this? If I am of so much\nvalue to you that you must take off twenty-five dollars for ten days'\nabsence, how is it that my salary is to be cut down to less than\nseventy-five dollars a quarter, if I remain here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI gave you fair notice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Silas. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a minute of it I took down\nimmed'ately after the intervoo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe lugged out his large pocket-book with the strap going all round it,\nand took from it a slip of paper which confirmed his statement.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBesides,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, slyly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI presoom you have received a liberal\npecooniary compensation from Squire Venner for nussin' his daughter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelen was looking over the bill while he was speaking.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBoard and lodging for ten days, Mr. Peckham,--whose board and lodging,\npray?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe door opened before Silas Peckham could answer, and Mr. Bernard\nwalked into the parlor. Helen was holding the bill in her hand, looking\nas any woman ought to look who has been at once wronged and insulted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe last turn of the thumbscrew!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Bernard to himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is it, Helen? You look troubled.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe handed him the account.\n\nHe looked at the footing of it. Then he looked at the items. Then he\nlooked at Silas Peckham.\n\nAt this moment Silas was sublime. He was so transcendently unconscious\nof the emotions going on in Mr. Bernard's mind at the moment, that he\nhad only a single thought.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe accaount's correc'ly cast, I presoom;--if the' 's any mistake\nof figgers or addin' 'em up, it'll be made all right. Everything's\naccordin' to agreement. The minute written immed'ately after the\nintervoo is here in my possession.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Bernard looked at Helen. Just what would have happened to Silas\nPeckham, as he stood then and there, but for the interposition of a\nmerciful Providence, nobody knows or ever will know; for at that moment\nsteps were heard upon the stairs, and Hiram threw open the parlor-door\nfor Mr. Dudley Venner to enter.\n\nHe saluted them all gracefully with the good-wishes of the season, and\neach of them returned his compliment,--Helen blushing fearfully, of\ncourse, but not particularly noticed in her embarrassment by more than\none.\n\nSilas Peckham reckoned with perfect confidence on his Trustees, who had\nalways said what he told them to, and done what he wanted. It was a good\nchance now to show off his power, and, by letting his instructors know\nthe unstable tenure of their offices, make it easier to settle his\naccounts and arrange his salaries. There was nothing very strange in Mr.\nVenner's calling; he was one of the Trustees, and this was New Year's\nDay. But he had called just at the lucky moment for Mr. Peckham's\nobject.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have thought some of makin' changes in the department of\ninstruction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he began. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeveral accomplished teachers have applied to\nme, who would be glad of sitooations. I understand that there never have\nbeen so many fust-rate teachers, male and female, out of employment as\ndoorin' the present season. If I can make sahtisfahctory arrangements\nwith my present corpse of teachers, I shall be glad to do so; otherwise\nI shell, with the permission of the Trustees, make sech noo arrangements\nas circumstahnces compel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may make arrangements for a new assistant in my department, Mr.\nPeckham,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Bernard, \u00e2\u0080\u009cat once,--this day,--this hour. I am not\nsafe to be trusted with your person five minutes out of this lady's\npresence,--of whom I beg pardon for this strong language. Mr. Venner, I\nmust beg you, as one of the Trustees of this Institution, to look at\nthe manner in which its Principal has attempted to swindle this faithful\nteacher whose toils and sacrifices and self-devotion to the school\nhave made it all that it is, in spite of this miserable trader's\nincompetence. Will you look at the paper I hold?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDudley Venner took the account and read it through, without changing a\nfeature. Then he turned to Silas Peckham.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may make arrangements for a new assistant in the branches this\nlady has taught. Miss Helen Darley is to be my wife. I had hoped to have\nannounced this news in a less abrupt and ungraceful manner. But I came\nto tell you with my own lips what you would have learned before evening\nfrom my friends in the village.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Bernard went to Helen, who stood silent, with downcast eyes, and\ntook her hand warmly, hoping she might find all the happiness she\ndeserved. Then he turned to Dudley Venner, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is a queen,\nbut has never found it out. The world has nothing nobler than this dear\nwoman, whom you have discovered in the disguise of a teacher. God bless\nher and you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDudley Venner returned his friendly grasp, without answering a word in\narticulate speech.\n\nSilas remained dumb and aghast for a brief space. Coming to himself\na little, he thought there might have been some mistake about the\nitems,--would like to have Miss barley's bill returned,--would make it\nall right,--had no idee that Squire Venner had a special int'rest in\nMiss barley,--was sorry he had given offence,--if he might take that\nbill and look it over--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. Mr. Peckham,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Dudley Venner, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere will be a full meeting\nof the Board next week, and the bill, and such evidence with reference\nto the management of the Institution and the treatment of its\ninstructors as Mr. Langdon sees fit to bring forward will be laid before\nthem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMiss Helen Darley became that very day the guest of Miss Arabella\nThornton, the Judge's daughter. Mr. Bernard made his appearance a week\nor two later at the Lectures, where the Professor first introduced him\nto the reader.\n\nHe stayed after the class had left the room.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, Mr. Langdon! how do you do? Very glad to see you back again. How\nhave you been since our correspondence on Fascination and other curious\nscientific questions?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was the Professor who spoke,--whom the reader will recognize as\nmyself, the teller of this story.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Bernard answered, with a serious look which\ninvited a further question.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope you have had none of those painful or dangerous experiences you\nseemed to be thinking of when you wrote; at any rate, you have escaped\nhaving your obituary written.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have seen some things worth remembering. Shall I call on you this\nevening and tell you about them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall be most happy to see you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was the way in which I, the Professor, became acquainted with some\nof the leading events of this story. They interested me sufficiently\nto lead me to avail myself of all those other extraordinary methods of\nobtaining information well known to writers of narrative.\n\nMr. Langdon seemed to me to have gained in seriousness and strength of\ncharacter by his late experiences. He threw his whole energies into\nhis studies with an effect which distanced all his previous efforts.\nRemembering my former hint, he employed his spare hours in writing for\nthe annual prizes, both of which he took by a unanimous vote of the\njudges. Those who heard him read his Thesis at the Medical Commencement\nwill not soon forget the impression made by his fine personal appearance\nand manners, nor the universal interest excited in the audience, as\nhe read, with his beautiful enunciation, that striking paper entitled\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnresolved Nebulae in Vital Science.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was a general remark of the\nFaculty,--and old Doctor Kittredge, who had come down on purpose to hear\nMr. Langdon, heartily agreed to it,--that there had never been a diploma\nfilled up, since the institution which conferred upon him the degree of\nDoctor Medicdnce was founded, which carried with it more of promise to\nthe profession than that which bore the name of\n\n                    BERNARDUS CARYL LANGDON\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII. CONCLUSION.\n\nMr. Bernard Langdon had no sooner taken his degree, than, in accordance\nwith the advice of one of his teachers whom he frequently consulted,\nhe took an office in the heart of the city where he had studied. He had\nthought of beginning in a suburb or some remoter district of the city\nproper.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his teacher,--to wit, myself,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cdon't do any such thing. You\nare made for the best kind of practice; don't hamper yourself with an\noutside constituency, such as belongs to a practitioner of the second\nclass. When a fellow like you chooses his beat, he must look ahead\na little. Take care of all the poor that apply to you, but leave the\nhalf-pay classes to a different style of doctor,--the people who spend\none half their time in taking care of their patients, and the other half\nin squeezing out their money. Go for the swell-fronts and south-exposure\nhouses; the folks inside are just as good as other people, and the\npleasantest, on the whole, to take care of. They must have somebody, and\nthey like a gentleman best. Don't throw yourself away. You have a\ngood presence and pleasing manners. You wear white linen by inherited\ninstinct. You can pronounce the word view. You have all the elements of\nsuccess; go and take it. Be polite and generous, but don't undervalue\nyourself. You will be useful, at any rate; you may just as well be\nhappy, while you are about it. The highest social class furnishes\nincomparably the best patients, taking them by and large. Besides,\nwhen they won't get well and bore you to death, you can send 'em off to\ntravel. Mind me now, and take the tops of your sparrowgrass. Somebody\nmust have 'em,--why shouldn't you? If you don't take your chance, you'll\nget the butt-ends as a matter of course.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Bernard talked like a young man full of noble sentiments. He wanted\nto be useful to his fellow-beings. Their social differences were nothing\nto him. He would never court the rich,--he would go where he was called.\nHe would rather save the life of a poor mother of a family than that of\nhalf a dozen old gouty millionaires whose heirs had been yawning and\nstretching these ten years to get rid of them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGenerous emotions!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I exclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCherish 'em; cling to 'em till you\nare fifty, till you are seventy, till you are ninety! But do as I tell\nyou,--strike for the best circle of practice, and you 'll be sure to get\nit!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Langdon did as I told him,--took a genteel office, furnished it\nneatly, dressed with a certain elegance, soon made a pleasant circle\nof acquaintances, and began to work his way into the right kind of\nbusiness. I missed him, however, for some days, not long after he had\nopened his office. On his return, he told me he had been up at Rockland,\nby special invitation, to attend the wedding of Mr. Dudley Venner and\nMiss Helen Darley. He gave me a full account of the ceremony, which\nI regret that I cannot relate in full. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHelen looked like an\nangel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--that, I am sure, was one of his expressions. As for her dress,\nI should like to give the details, but am afraid of committing blunders,\nas men always do, when they undertake to describe such matters. White\ndress, anyhow,--that I am sure of,--with orange-flowers, and the most\nwonderful lace veil that was ever seen or heard of. The Reverend Doctor\nHoneywood performed the ceremony, of course. The good people seemed\nto have forgotten they ever had had any other minister, except Deacon\nShearer and his set of malcontents, who were doing a dull business in\nthe meeting-house lately occupied by the Reverend Mr. Fairweather.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho was at the wedding?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEverybody, pretty much. They wanted to keep it quiet, but it was of\nno use. Married at church. Front pews, old Dr. Kittredge and all the\nmansionhouse people and distinguished strangers,--Colonel Sprowle and\nfamily, including Matilda's young gentleman, a graduate of one of\nthe fresh-water colleges,--Mrs. Pickins (late Widow Rowens) and\nhusband,--Deacon Soper and numerous parishioners. A little nearer the\ndoor, Abel, the Doctor's man, and Elbridge, who drove them to church in\nthe family-coach. Father Fairweather, as they all call him now, came in\nlate with Father McShane.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd Silas Peckham?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Silas had left The School and Rockland. Cut up altogether too\nbadly in the examination instituted by the Trustees. Had removed over\nto Tamarack, and thought of renting a large house and 'farming' the\ntown-poor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSome time after this, as I was walking with a young friend along by\nthe swell-fronts and south-exposures, whom should I see but Mr. Bernard\nLangdon, looking remarkably happy, and keeping step by the side of\na very handsome and singularly well-dressed young lady? He bowed and\nlifted his hat as we passed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is that pretty girl my young doctor has got there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said to my\ncompanion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don't know? Why, that is neither more\nnor less than Miss Letitia Forrester, daughter of--of--why, the great\nbanking firm, you know, Bilyuns Brothers & Forrester. Got acquainted\nwith her in the country, they say. There 's a story that they're\nengaged, or like to be, if the firm consents.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\nI did not like the look of it in the least. Too young,--too young. Has\nnot taken any position yet. No right to ask for the hand of Bilyuns\nBrothers & Co.'s daughter. Besides, it will spoil him for practice, if\nhe marries a rich girl before he has formed habits of work.\n\nI looked in at his office the other day. A box of white kids was lying\nopen on the table. A three-cornered note, directed in a very delicate\nlady's-hand, was distinguishable among a heap of papers. I was just\ngoing to call him to account for his proceedings, when he pushed\nthe three-cornered note aside and took up a letter with a great\ncorporation-seal upon it. He had received the offer of a professor's\nchair in an ancient and distinguished institution.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPretty well for three-and-twenty, my boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose you'll\nthink you must be married one of these days, if you accept this office.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Langdon blushed.--There had been stories about him, he knew. His\nname had been mentioned in connection with that of a very charming young\nlady. The current reports were not true. He had met this young lady,\nand been much pleased with her, in the country, at the house of her\ngrandfather, the Reverend Doctor Honeywood,--you remember Miss Letitia\nForrester, whom I have mentioned repeatedly? On coming to town, he found\nhis country-acquaintance in a social position which seemed to discourage\nhis continued intimacy. He had discovered, however; that he was a not\nunwelcome visitor, and had kept up friendly relations with her. But\nthere was no truth in the current reports,--none at all.'\n\nSome months had passed, after this visit, when I happened one evening to\nstroll into a box in one of the principal theatres of the city. A small\nparty sat on the seats before me: a middle-aged gentleman and his lady,\nin front, and directly behind them my young doctor and the same very\nhandsome young lady I had seen him walking with on the sidewalk before\nthe swell-fronts and south-exposures. As Professor Langdon seemed to\nbe very much taken up with his companion, and both of them looked as\nif they were enjoying themselves, I determined not to make my presence\nknown to my young friend, and to withdraw quietly after feasting my eyes\nwith the sight of them for a few minutes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt looks as if something might come of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said to myself. At that\nmoment the young lady lifted her arm accidentally in such a way that the\nlight fell upon the clasp of a chain which encircled her wrist. My eyes\nfilled with tears as I read upon the clasp, in sharp-cut Italic\nletters, E. V. They were tears at once of sad remembrance and of joyous\nanticipation; for the ornament on which I looked was the double\npledge of a dead sorrow and a living affection. It was the golden\nbracelet,--the parting-gift of Elsie Venner, the golden bracelet,--the\nparting-gift of Elsie Venner.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Elsie Venner, by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ELSIE VENNER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 2696-0.txt or 2696-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/2\/6\/9\/2696\/\n\nProduced by David Widger\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":85,"split":"train"}
