He scrapes a living running errands in the streets; his beloved but frail sister Nelly, a year younger, sells matches. Their mother is dead, their father a drink-sodden brute. When he becomes violent towards Nelly, the two children run away from home. Helped by their friend the night-watchman Joe Wrag, and 'Granny' Betty Barker, they manage to retain their independence and learn to lead Christian lives. Nelly, a child of great natural spiritual insight, acts as Benny's moral conscience; when she dies after a street accident, he is in despair. A lucky encounter with Eva Lawrence, the little girl he will come to call his 'angel', leads to a job as office-boy to her father, a rich Liverpool businessman. Benny works hard, hoping to educate and better himself, but loses both job and reputation when Mr. Lawrence wrongly accuses him of stealing a five-pound note. Abandoning Liverpool, he nearly dies of starvation and heat-stroke, but is rescued and nursed back to health by a kindly farming family. He remains with them, working on the farm and studying in night school. Six years later, and by now grown up, he bravely stops a runaway carriage in a nearby lane; only afterwards does he discover that one of its occupants was Eva Lawrence. Benny has saved his 'angel's' life; now she reveals that she and her father have long known that he was innocent of the theft. The grateful Mr. Lawrence offers Benny a new job, this time as his clerk; he returns to Liverpool, to work his way up into partnership with Mr. Lawrence, and marriage with Eva.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Her Benny, by Silas Kitto Hocking\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Getting to know them in their homes, I was glad to stop\nand speak to them in the streets, and give them a word of sympathy and\nencouragement. They are not all bad, as many people seem to think.\nMany of them try hard to earn an honest living, though they find it a\ndifficult matter, especially when at home they receive no encouragement,\nwhile in the streets temptation is being continually put in their way by\nthose of whom \"Perks\" so justly complained.\n\nThe grouping of the characters that figure in the story is purely\nfictitious, but not the characters themselves. Benny and little Nell,\nPerks and Joe Wrag, Granny and Eva Lawrence, are drawn from life. I knew\nthem well. Some of them are alive to-day, others have gone to their rest.\n\nFor the interest my little story has awakened in both old and young,\nin its serial form, I am rejoiced and thankful; and if, in the more\npermanent and attractive style it now assumes, it shall awaken any\nsympathy for the poor little waifs of our streets, I shall have my\nreward.\n\n\nSILAS K.

But a fog had hung all over Liverpool since morning,\nand everything was as damp and dismal as it well could be; and now,\nas evening came on, the fog had settled into a downright drizzle,\nconverting the streets into what seemed to Nelly Bates (who was\ncrouched in the shadow of St. George's Church) to be endless puddles.\n\n\"I wish Benny would come,\" said she to herself. \"I wonder what has kept\nhim? He said he'd be here when the clock struck four.\"\n\nAnd she wrapped her tattered clothes more closely around her, and looked\neagerly down Lord Street and up and down Castle Street. But no Benny\nappeared in sight.\n\n\"I'm glad as how they's lightin' the lamps, anyhow. It'll make it feel a\nbit warmer, I reckon,\" she went on, \"for it's terrible cold. But Benny\nwon't be long now, nohow. I hope he's sold all his fusees.\"\n\nAnd she looked wistfully at the unsold matches lying in her lap. Then,\nafter a pause, she went on again,\n\n\"I's had desp'rate bad luck to-day. I reckon the gen'lmen thinks it too\nmuch trouble to take off their gloves to get at the coppers. I wonder if\nthey know what it is to be cold and hungry like me?\"\n\nAnd the child moved a little farther into the shadow of the church, to\nescape the keen cold blast that swept up from the river.\n\nLittle Nelly Bates was a delicate-looking child, with a pale, thoughtful\nface, and big, round, dreamy-looking eyes. She had none of that wolfish\nexpression that so often characterizes the street Arabs of our large\ntowns and cities; but, on the contrary, there was an air of refinement\nabout her that was difficult to account for. Poor little waif! Her own\nmother she could not remember. She had only known a stepmother--a cruel,\ndrunken woman; and, alas! her father was no better. Almost as soon as\nshe could walk she had been sent into the streets with her brother\nBenny, who was a year older, to get her living as best she could. Never\nknowing a parent's love, the affections of these two children had gone\nout to each other. Each to each was more than all the world beside. At\nthe time our story opens Nelly was nine years of age, and Benny, as we\nsaid, a year older.\n\nStill the minutes dragged along, and Benny came not. The 'busses were\ncrowded with people outside and in, wrapped in huge warm overcoats, and\nall down Lord Street she watched the hurrying crowds bending their steps\nhomewards. And she tried to picture their cheerful homes, with great\nblazing fires, and happy children running to greet them, and wondered\nhow none of them ever paused to notice her, shivering there in the\nshadow of the church.\n\nAt length the great clocks all around began to strike five, and Benny\nhad not come; a sense of unutterable loneliness crept over the child,\nand she began to cry. Besides, she was hungry and cold, and there was\na great fear in her heart that something had befallen her brother. The\nlast stroke of the Town Hall clock, however, had scarcely died away\nwhen she heard the patter of bare feet around the corner, and the next\nmoment her brother, panting and breathless, stood before her.\n\n\"Oh, Nell!\" he burst out, \"I's just soft, I is. I's missed a hour in\nthe time. I never did think I was sich a fool. But can't be helped now,\nnohow.\"\n\n\"I was afraid you'd got hurt, Benny; but I don't care now you're all\nright,\" said Nelly, looking proudly at the flushed face of her sturdy\nyoung brother.\n\n\"Me hurt? Oh, never fear! I knows how to take care of myself. But what\nluck, Nell?\"\n\n\"Bad, Benny, very bad. Nobody wanted matches to-day.\"\n\nFor a moment Benny was silent, then he burst out,\n\n\"By golly, Nell! what's us to do? You know what the guv'nor said when we\ncame away this morning?\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said Nelly. \"But 'ave you 'ad bad luck too?\"\n\n\"Horful, Nell--simply horful!\"\n\nAnd for a moment the children looked at each other in blank dismay. Just\nthen a gentleman was seen crossing the street carrying a portmanteau.\n\n\"Here's a gent with a portmantle,\" whispered Benny to his sister. \"I'll\ntry my luck! Foller me, Nell, as quick as you can.\" And off he darted\nacross the street.\n\n\"Carry yer bag, sir?\" said he, stepping in front of the gentleman; and\nthere was something very appealing in his tone as he spoke.\n\nThe gentleman looked kindly down into the two honest-looking eyes that\nflashed in the gaslight.\n\n\"What will you take the bag to the ferry for?\" he inquired.\n\n\"For what you please to give,\" said Benny sturdily. \"Times is bad at\npresent, and little chaps like us is glad to 'ave what we catches.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's it, is it? But I'm afraid this bag is too heavy for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, never fear,\" said Benny, as he got hold of the portmanteau. \"I'se\n'mazing strong, and I ken carry this like winkin'.\" And he trotted down\nthe street before the gentleman in a way that showed he was in earnest\nabout the matter.\n\nThe gentleman looked after the little fellow with an amused smile, but\nvolunteered no further remark.\n\nMeanwhile little Nelly, who had become stiff and cramped with cold,\nfollowed at a little distance, taking care, however, that Benny did\nnot get out of her sight. On reaching the bridge that led down to the\nlanding-stage, Benny turned round, and, seeing his sister behind,\nshouted back,\n\n\"Stay here, Nell, till I come back--I'll be no time sca'ce.\" And down\nthe bridge he trotted, evidently glad that he was so near laying down\nhis burden.\n\n\"Woodside boat, sir?\" said he, turning round to the gentleman.\n\n\"Yes, my lad.\"\n\n\"Here we is, then, jist in time.\" And down the gangway he went at a\nsharp trot, and into the saloon, letting the bag down on one of the\nseats with a thump. \"There you be, sir. Couldn't a-been sarved quicker\nby a bigger chap.\"\n\n\"All right, my little fellow,\" and he held out his hand.\n\nBenny's eyes gleamed as he caught sight of something white between the\ngentleman's finger and thumb.\n\n\"Be jabbers! it's a thrip'ny,\" was his mental soliloquy, as he eagerly\nclutched the coin; and bowing his thanks as politely as he knew how,\nhe dashed up the gangway with the fleetness of the wind, muttering to\nhimself, \"Shouldn't wonder if 't was a fo'penny, arter all.\" Standing\nunder a lamp, he took the coin out of his mouth and looked at it. \"Oh,\nglory!\" he ejaculated; \"if 't ain't haaf a bob. Murder and turf! this\nare a catch!\" And he turned two somersaults on the stage by way of\nexpressing his delight, unfortunately, however, planting his foot in his\nsecond revolution in the stomach of a young gentleman who was hurrying\ndown to catch the boat.\n\nThe gentleman soon recovered his sudden loss of wind, though the dirty\nfootprint on his immaculate coat was not so easily removed.\n\n\"Beg pardon,\" said Benny, in a fright, and hurried away just in time to\nescape a vigorous kick aimed at him by the infuriated young gentleman.\n\"My stars and stockings!\" he soliloquized, as he hurried up the bridge\nto join his sister. \"If he 'ad a-catched me, I'd a-got a wolloping, an'\nno mistake. Hallo, Nell! what's a matter?\" he said, as he saw great\ntears on the cheeks of his little crouching sister.\n\n\"I'se so cold, Benny--oh, so very cold!\" sobbed the little girl.\n\n\"Never mind, Nelly, I'll soon get yer warmed up. Look here, I'se got\nhaaf a bob, and a good warming into the bargain. Now for a roast tater,\nmy gal, and you'll feel as right as ninepence.\"\n\nAnd, taking his sister by the hand, they hurried away at a quick trot,\nlessening their pace only when they were quite out of breath, and Nelly\ndeclared she was quite warm.\n\n\"Here's the tater man,\" said Benny; \"now for't, my gal. Pennorth o'\ntaters--hot, plaise, an' a good sprinkle o' salt,\" said Benny, with\nquite an air of importance.\n\n\"All right, my young gent, 'ere you are;\" and the man put three\nmoderate-sized potatoes into Benny's outstretched palms.\n\n\"Now for old Joe's fire, Nell, where the roads is a-mendin';\" and once\nmore they hurried away at the same quick trot.\n\nIn the next street they caught sight of the glowing grate of Joe Wrag,\nthe night watchman, and of Joe himself, sitting in the doorway of his\nlittle wooden hut.\n\n\"You ax him, Nell,\" whispered Benny; \"he winna say no to you.\"\n\n\"May we eat our taters by your fire, Joe?\" said the plaintive voice of\nlittle Nelly, as she placed her tiny hand on the fence, on which a red\nlight was burning.\n\n\"What dost 'a say, little woman?\" said Joe, in a rough though not\nunkindly voice.\n\n\"May we eat our taters by your fire, please--Benny an' me?\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, my little 'arties. Come along, I'll make room for 'e here;\" and\nhonest old Joe moved aside to make room for the little waifs who sought\nshelter from the biting cold.\n\n\"By golly, Nell!\" said Benny, as he felt the grateful warmth of the\nfire, and dug his teeth into the potato, \"ain't this sumpshus?\"\n\n\"Ay, Benny,\" was all the child's answer, as she greedily devoured the\ntwo potatoes that Benny had insisted was her share.\n\nThen there was silence between them for awhile, and Joe went out and\nheaped more fuel on the grate, while Nelly kept her eyes steadily\nfixed on the fire. What did the child see as she gazed into its glowing\ndepths? For ever and anon a sweet smile played around the corners of her\nmouth, and spread over her pale thoughtful face, lighting it up with\na wonderful beauty, and smoothing out the lines of care that at other\ntimes were only too visible.\n\nMeanwhile Benny was busily engaged counting his money. Fourpence he\nlaid aside for the purpose of purchasing stock for the morrow's sale, a\npenny he had spent in potatoes, and still he had threepence to the good,\nbesides the sixpence the gentleman gave him, which was clear profit. The\nsixpence was evidently a great prize to him, for he looked at it long\nand earnestly.\n\n\"Wish I could keep it for mysel',\" he muttered; \"but it's no go--the\nguv'nor will 'ave to 'ave it. But the coppers I'll keep 'ginst bad\ntimes. Here, Nell,\" he said, nudging his sister, \"you keep these 'ere\ncoppers; and then if the guv'nor axes me if I has any more, I can tell\nhim no.\"\n\n\"All right, Benny.\" And again the great round eyes sought the glowing\ngrate, and the sweet smile played over her face once more.\n\n\"What are 'e looking at, Nell?\" said Benny, after a pause. \"You look as\n'appy as a dead duck in a saucepan.\"\n\n\"Oh, Benny, I see such beautiful pictures in the fire. Don't you\n'members on fine days how we looks across the river and sees the great\nhills 'way behind Birkenhead, such miles an' miles away?\"\n\n\"Ay, I 'members. I'll take 'e across the river some day, Nell, when I'se\nricher.\"\n\n\"Will 'e, Benny? I shall be so glad. But I sees great hills in the fire,\nan' trees, an' pools, an' little rivers, an' oh! such lots of purty\nthings.\"\n\n\"Queer!\" said Benny. \"I don't see nowt o' sort.\"\n\nThen there was silence again, and Joe--who had been to see that the\nlamps at each end of the torn-up street were all right--came up.\n\n\"How are 'e now, my 'arties? Are 'e warmer'n you was?\"\n\n\"Ay, Joe, we's nice now,\" said Nelly; \"an' we's much 'bliged to you for\nlettin' us come.\"\n\n\"Oh, ye're welcome. But ain't it time you was to home?\"\n\n\"What's o'clock?\" said Benny.\n\n\"Seven, all to a minit or so.\"\n\n\"Ay, then, we must be off,\" said the children in chorus; and wishing Joe\ngood night, they darted off into the wet, cold street, and disappeared\nin the gloom.\n\n\"Purty little hangel!\" said Joe, as he stood looking up the street long\nafter they had disappeared. \"I wonder what will become o' her when she\ngrows up?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nAddler's Hall.\n\n                           The whole court\n  Went boiling, bubbling up from all the doors\n  And windows, with a hideous wail of laughs\n  And roar of oaths, and blows, perhaps.... I passed\n  Too quickly for distinguishing ... and pushed\n  A little side door hanging on a hinge,\n  And plunged into the dark.\n                        --Elizabeth Barrett Browning.\n\n\nOn the western side of Scotland Road--that is to say, between it and\nthe Docks--there is a regular network of streets, inhabited mostly by\nthe lowest class of the Liverpool poor. And those who have occasion to\npenetrate their dark and filthy recesses are generally thankful when\nthey find themselves safe out again. In the winter those streets and\ncourts are kept comparatively clean by the heavy rains; but in the\nsummer the air fairly reeks with the stench of decayed fish, rotting\nvegetables, and every other conceivable kind of filth.\n\nThe children, that seem to fairly swarm in this neighbourhood, are\nnearly all of a pale, sallow complexion, and of stunted growth. Shoes\nand stockings and underclothing are luxuries that they never know, and\none good meal a day is almost more than they dare hope for. Cuffs and\nkicks they reckon upon every day of their lives; and in this they are\nrarely disappointed, and a lad who by dodging or cunning can escape this\ndaily discipline is looked upon by the others as \"'mazin' cute.\"\n\nTo occupy two rooms is a luxury that only comparatively few families\nindulge in. Why should they pay rent for two rooms when one will answer\nthe purpose? \"We know a trick worth two o' that,\" is their boast. And so\nyear by year they bid defiance to all law and authority.\n\nThe police rarely, if ever, venture into this neighbourhood alone, or if\none should be foolish enough to do so, he has generally to pay dearly\nfor his indiscretion. House agents and policemen are objects of special\naversion.\n\nA friend of ours, some years ago, came into considerable property in\nthis neighbourhood, and employed a young man who was new to the work\nto collect the rents for him. On entering the first house the agent was\nconfronted by a big, villainous-looking man, who demanded in a surly\ntone what he wanted.\n\n\"I am come for the rent,\" said the agent.\n\n\"Oh, you have, have you?\" was the reply.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Ah! Did anybody see you come in?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nAnd instantly seizing a huge poker and waving it in the air, he shouted\nto the affrighted agent, with a terrible oath, \"Then I'll take care\nnobody ever sees you go out.\"\n\nThis had the desired effect, and the terrified agent escaped for his\nlife. At the next house at which he called he was received very blandly.\n\n\"So you have come for the rint, have you?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is my business.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, indeed, very proper. Could you change a five pun' note, now?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"That will do.\" Then raising his voice to a loud pitch, he shouted,\n\"Mike, come down here; there's a chap that 'as five pun' in his pocket;\nlet's collar him--quick!\"\n\nAnd a second time the affrighted agent fled, and gave up the situation\nat once, vowing he would never enter any of those streets again while he\nlived.\n\nIt was to this neighbourhood that Benny Bates and his sister wended\ntheir way, after leaving old Joe and his warm fire. Whether the\nlamplighter had neglected his duty, or whether some of the inhabitants,\n\"loving darkness rather than light,\" had shut off the gas, is not\ncertain; but anyhow Bowker's Row and several of the adjacent courts were\nin total darkness.\n\nThis, however, seemed no matter of surprise to Benny and little Nell,\nwho wended their way without difficulty along the rough, ill-paved\nstreet. At length they turned up a narrow court, darker and dirtier even\nthan Bowker's Row, which went by the name of \"Addler's Hall.\" About\nhalf-way up this court they paused for a moment and listened; then,\ncautiously pushing open a door, they entered the only home they had ever\nknown.\n\nMuch to their relief, they found the house empty. A lump of coal was\nsmouldering in the grate, which Benny at once broke up, and soon a ruddy\nglare from the fire lighted up the dismal room.\n\nThe furniture consisted of a three-legged round table, a chair minus\na leg, and a three-legged stool. On the window-sill there was a glass\nbottle with a candle stuck in the neck, and under the stairs there\nwas a heap of rags and shavings, on which Benny and his sister slept.\nA frying-pan was suspended against the wall near the fireplace, and\nseveral cracked cups and saucers, together with a quart mug, stood on\nthe table. The only other article of furniture was a small cupboard in\na corner of the room close up to the ceiling, placed there, no doubt, to\nbe out of the way of the children.\n\nDrawing the chair and the stool close up to the fire, Benny and his\nsister waited the return of their parents.\n\nOutside, the wind moaned and wailed, and whistled through the keyhole\nand the chinks in the door, and rattled the paper and rags with which\nthe holes in the window were stopped. And as the children listened they\nshivered, and drew closer together, and nearer the fire.\n\n\"By golly!\" said Benny, \"this 'ouse is like a hair-balloon. I wish as\nhow we could keep the wind out.\"\n\n\"You can't do that, Benny; it creeps in everywheres.\"\n\n\"Are 'e cold, Nell?\"\n\n\"No, not very; but I's very hungry.\"\n\nJust then an uncertain step was heard in the court outside, and the next\nmoment their stepmother staggered into the room.\n\n\"Now, out of the way, you brats,\" was her greeting, \"while I cooks your\nfaather's supper.\"\n\nAnd without a word they got out of her way as quickly as possible, for\nthey saw at a glance she was not in the best of humours. They were\npleased to see, however, that she had brought with her a loaf of bread,\nsome butter, and several red herrings, and so they were hopeful that for\nonce they would get a good supper.\n\nThe supper was not quite ready when their father came in, flushed and\nexcited.\n\n\"Where's the brats?\" was his first angry exclamation, glancing round the\nroom.\n\n\"There,\" said his wife, pointing under the stairs, where the children\nwere crouched.\n\n\"Come out here, you young vermin; quick! do you hear?\"\n\nAnd the frightened children came out and stood before him.\n\n\"Have you brought me that sixpence that I told yer? For, if you\nain't,\" said he, scowling at Benny, \"I'll loosen yer hide for yer in\ndouble-quick time.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said the little fellow, producing the sixpence, \"'ere it are.\"\n\n\"Is that all you've got?\"\n\nBenny shot a quick glance at his sister before replying, which, however,\ndid not escape his father's eye.\n\n\"Ay,\" he said, stoutly; \"I ain't got no more.\"\n\n\"You lie, you villain!\" roared the father; \"fork it out this moment.\"\n\n\"I tell yer I ain't got none,\" said Benny. Nelly was about to speak\nhere, but a glance from her brother silenced her.\n\n\"Will you fork it out?\" said the father again.\n\n\"No,\" was the reply.\n\nIn a moment Dick Bates had taken the leather strap from his waist, and\nwithout mercy rained blow after blow upon the head and shoulders of his\nchild.\n\nAt first Benny bore the blows without shrinking and without uttering a\ncry; but this only the more aggravated the inhuman father, and faster\nand more furious fell the blows, till the little fellow shrieked with\npain and begged for mercy. But there was no mercy in the father's heart,\nand still the blows fell, till little Nelly, unable longer to bear it,\nrushed in between her father and brother, saying, \"You shall not beat\nBenny so.\"\n\n\"Oh, you want it too, do you?\" roared he. \"Then take that, and that, and\nthat.\"\n\n\"Faather,\" said Benny, \"will you strike Nell?\"\n\nThe question for a moment seemed to stagger him, and he looked down upon\nthe pleading face of his suffering child, and into those great round\neyes that were full of pain and tears, and the hand that was raised to\nstrike fell powerless to his side, and with a groan he turned away.\n\nWhat was there in the face of his little daughter that touched this\ncruel, besotted man? We cannot tell. Perhaps he caught a glimpse in that\nsweet face of his early love.\n\nIt is said that he loved his first wife dearly, and that while she\nlived he was tolerably steady, and was never unkind to her. He even went\nwith her to the house of prayer, and listened to her while she read the\nBible aloud during winter evenings. These were happy days, but when she\ndied all this was changed; he tried to forget his trouble in drink, and\nin the companionship of the lowest and most degraded men and women.\n\nThen he married again, a coarse drunken woman, who had ever since led\nhim a wretched life; and every year he had become more drunken and\nvicious.\n\nIf he yet loved anything in the world, it was his \"little Nell,\" as he\nalways called her. She was wonderfully like her mother, the neighbours\nsaid, and that was doubtless the reason why Dick Bates continued to love\nher when all love for everything else had died out of his heart.\n\nHe had never treated her before as he had treated her to-night; it was a\nnew experience to the child, and for long after she lay on her heap of\nshavings with dry eyes and hot cheeks, staring into vacancy.\n\nBut when the last spark of fire had died out, and her father and\nstepmother were asleep in the room above, turning to her brother, who\nwas still awake, she said,\n\n\"Put your arm about me, Benny, will yer?\"\n\nAnd Benny put his arm around his little sister, and pressed her face to\nhis bosom. And then the fountain of the child's tears was broken up,\nand she wept as though her heart would break, and great sobs shook her\nlittle frame, and broke the silence of the night.\n\nBenny silently kissed away the tears, and tried to comfort the little\nbreaking heart. After awhile she grew calm, and Benny grew resolute.\n\n\"I's not going to stand this no longer,\" he said.\n\n\"What will you do, Benny?\"\n\n\"Do? Well, I dunno, yet; but I's bound to do some'at, an' I will too.\"\n\nAfter awhile he spoke again. \"I say, Nell, ain't yer hungry? for I is. I\nbelieve I could eat a grave-stun.\"\n\n\"I was hungry afore faather beat me, but I doesna feel it now,\" was the\nreply.\n\n\"Well, I seen where mother put the bread an' butter, and if I dunna fork\nthe lot I's not Ben Bates.\"\n\n\"But how will yer get to it, Benny?\"\n\n\"Aisy 'nough, on'y you must 'elp me.\"\n\nSo without much noise they moved the table into the corner of the room\nunderneath the cupboard, and placing the chair on the top of the table,\nBenny mounted the top, and was able to reach the cupboard without\ndifficulty.\n\nA fair share of the loaf remained, and \"heaps of butter,\" Benny said.\n\n\"Now, Nell,\" said he, \"we'll 'ave a feast.\"\n\nAnd a feast they did have, according to Benny's thinking, for very\nlittle of either loaf or butter remained when they had finished their\nrepast.\n\n\"What will mother say when she finds out?\" said Nelly, when they had\nagain lain down.\n\n\"We must be off afore she wakes, Nell, and never come back no more.\"\n\n\"Dost 'a mean it, Benny?\"\n\n\"Ay do I. We mun take all our traps wi' us i' t' morning.\"\n\n\"Where shall us go?\"\n\n\"Never fear, we'll find a shop somewheres, an' anywheres is better nor\nthis.\"\n\n\"Ay, that's so.\"\n\n\"Now, Nell, we mun sleep a bit, 'cause as how we'll 'ave to be stirring\nairly.\"\n\nAnd soon the brother and sister were fast asleep, locked in each other's\narms.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nRoughing it.\n\n  Ne'er saw I, never felt a calm so deep!\n    The river glideth at his own sweet will:\n  Dear God, the very houses seem asleep;\n    And all that mighty heart is lying still.\n                           --Wordsworth\n\n\nNext morning Benny was stirring early, and when the first faint rays of\nthe coming day peeped through the dust-begrimed and patched-up window,\nthey saw the little fellow busily engaged in gathering together what\nthings he and Nelly possessed previous to their final departure from\nhome.\n\nNelly still slept on, and several times the brother paused and looked\nfondly down upon the fair face of the sleeping child. She looked very\nbeautiful, Benny thought, as she lay sleeping there, with a pink spot\nglowing on either cheek, and the long flaxen hair thrown carelessly back\nfrom the pale forehead. Once or twice she murmured in her sheep, and the\nsame happy smile spread over her face that he had noticed the evening\nbefore when she sat gazing into Joe Wrag's fire.\n\n\"I wonder what she's a-dreamin' on?\" he murmured to himself. \"Perhaps\nshe sees the hills and flowers and trees agin.\"\n\nThen he set to work again turning over a heap of rubbish that had been\npushed as far back as possible under the stairs. At length a joyful\nexclamation burst from his lips as he came upon a small heap of potatoes.\n\n\"Here's a fortin', an' no mistake; Nell and I'll be able to walk off the\nlot.\"\n\nAnd he brought them out into the room, and wrapped them up in an old\nhandkerchief that his stepmother used to tie round her head when she\nwent out. There were scarcely twenty potatoes altogether, but to Benny\nthey seemed almost an inexhaustible supply.\n\nThis being done, he sat down beside his sleeping sister and waited until\nhe should hear any movement in the room above. Gradually the cold grey\nlight of the morning stole into the room, revealing all its squalor and\ndinginess, and Benny felt that he and Nelly would have to make their\nescape soon, or else they might be prevented. He felt very loth to awake\nhis sister, she slept so sweetly, and he did not know where they might\nfind a shelter when darkness covered the earth again. But there was no\nhelp for it. His father might awake any moment, and the neighbours would\nsoon be stirring in the court and in Bowker's Row. So bending over her,\nhe pressed his lips upon her brow: still she moved not.\n\n\"Nelly,\" he whispered, \"it's time to be movin'.\"\n\nSlowly the great round eyes opened, and looked languidly up into his\nface.\n\n\"Come, stir your pegs, Nell, or we'll be too late.\"\n\n\"Oh, ay,\" she said, as the recollection of the previous evening came\nback to her. \"We 'as to be off to-day, ain't we?\"\n\n\"Ay, my gal, we's goin' on our own 'ook now, so look alive.\"\n\n\"Does yer think we's doin' right, Benny?\"\n\n\"'Course we is, Nell; I'll take care o' yer, never fear.\"\n\nThus reassured, she followed Benny silently out of the house and into\nBowker's Row; then seeing that no one was about, they set off at a quick\ntrot in the direction from whence they had come the previous night.\n\nNelly had the utmost confidence in Benny's sagacity, and though she had\ndoubted for a moment whether they were doing the wisest thing in the\ncourse they were taking, yet she had little doubt that her brother would\nbe equal to every emergency, and that he would find her a home of some\nsort. And the child had a vague, undefined feeling that they could not\nbe worse off, whatever might happen. To see her Benny punished as she\nhad so frequently done of late was \"pain and grief\" to her: not only had\nhe suffered the pinchings of cold and hunger during the day, but he had\nbeen compelled to bring home a certain amount every night, or else take\nthe consequences of her father's senseless anger.\n\nAnd as the child thought of these things she could not wonder that Benny\nhad resolved to run away and seek a home somewhere else. But what of\nherself? She had on the whole been much better treated, and she thought\nperhaps her father did not well know what he was doing last night, as\nhe was in drink. Ought she, then, to run away? \"Ay, but I canna leave\nBenny,\" was her mental response; and having settled that question,\nshe seemed perfectly satisfied to share the fortunes of her brother,\nwhatever they might be, and help him as best she could to fight the\nbattle of life.\n\nAs for Benny, he had no qualms of conscience about the matter. He had\nnever heard the command,\n\n\"Honour thy father and thy mother,\" and even if he had, it would not\nhave troubled him on the present occasion. He had a feeling that he had\nbeen wronged, cruelly wronged, and that he ought not to stand it any\nlonger. Once the question had crossed his mind, \"Had he any right to\ntake those potatoes?\" But he answered the question to himself by saying,\n\"Ain't I brought home a haaf a bob every night for th' week, an' then\nbin kep' without supper? By jabbers, I's paid for those taters, and I'll\neat 'em.\" Moreover, his notions of right and wrong were of the vaguest\ncharacter. He had some dim recollection of his mother, and how she used\nto tell him it was wrong to steal, and to tell lies, and to cheat. But\nthe more he tried to recall it, the vaguer the recollection became. Yet\nsometimes when he was tempted to steal, and would look around to see\nthat no one was watching him, a voice within him would whisper, \"Don't,\nBenny, it is wrong to steal,\" and he would turn away with a sigh,\nfeeling that there was something in that voice that he dared not disobey.\n\nIn after years he held firmly to the belief that his own mother was\npermitted to be the guardian angel of his childhood, and that it was\nshe who whispered to him when he was tempted to do wrong. He has\nalso been heard to say, that though he regarded it as very wrong for\nchildren, under ordinary circumstances, to leave their home without\ntheir parents' consent, yet in his case he thought his action perfectly\njustifiable.\n\nBut we must leave this question, with the hope that none of the children\nwho read this story may be driven by cruelty and wrong to a similar\ncourse of action, and must follow the little waifs as they threaded\ntheir way through the dingy streets that cold December morning. Their\nobject was to reach Joe Wrag's fire before his watch ended, and in this\nthey were successful. Joe was standing before his hut, rubbing his hands\nover the still glowing grate, though Benny noticed that the fire was\nburning low.\n\n\"We's brought some taters from hum, may we cook 'em on yer fire, Joe?\"\nsaid Benny, putting on as bold a face as he could. Joe looked at the\nchildren for a moment without speaking.\n\n\"Please do, Joe, like a good man,\" chimed in Nelly's plaintive voice.\n\n\"Come along with yer, then. But how are 'e out so airly?\"\n\n\"Lots o' bisness on hand,\" was Benny's prompt reply.\n\n\"There's some'at up wi' you youngsters, I reckon. But yer not goin' to\neat all these taters at once, are yer?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" said Benny, \"we on'y want two apiece, and we want you to keep\nthe rest till we comes agin.\"\n\n\"Very likely story,\" said Joe, gruffly. \"Where's yer bin stealin' 'em\nfrom?\"\n\n\"Oh, nowheres, Joe,\" said Nelly. \"We bringed 'em from hum, we did, for\nsure.\"\n\n\"Well, ain't that a-stealin' on 'em?\"\n\n\"No!\" said Benny stoutly. \"I's tooked 'em hum a haaf a bob every night\nfor t' week, and they b'longs to me.\"\n\nJoe shook his head dubiously, as if not certain of the soundness of\nBenny's logic, but made no further reply. He, however, gave his aid\nto the children in cooking their potatoes, which were soon done to a\nnicety, and even gave them a piece of bread, the remains of his own\nmorning's repast. Thus fortified, the children were soon ready for the\nduties of the day.\n\nTheir first business was to go into Park Lane and get in a stock of\nmatches for the day's sale; this done, they separated and went their\ndifferent ways, agreeing to meet in the shadow of St. George's Church at\ntwelve o'clock, and at four, to report progress.\n\nNelly's stand was near the junction of Lord Street, Church Street,\nParadise Street, and Whitechapel, going occasionally as far as the\n\"Sailors' Home.\" Benny, on the other hand, waited about near the\nlanding-stage, selling his matches if he could, but at the same time\nlooking out for an opportunity of carrying some gentleman's bag.\n\nBut to-day Benny had another object in view, and that was to discover,\nif possible, some place where he and his sister might sleep when night\ncame on. He knew of a place where, for the payment of a penny each, they\nmight sleep in a cellar on some dirty straw amongst a lot of rough boys.\nBut somehow Benny shrank from introducing his sister to such company as\nthere assembled night after night. He must find some place where they\ncould be alone, if possible, though he felt that that would be no easy\nmatter.\n\nThe day was beautifully fine, with a clear frosty sky, and both Benny\nand his sister carried on a brisk sale in fusees, and when they met at\nnoon they were in high spirits over the proceeds of the day. Still Benny\nhad found no place as yet where to spend the night.\n\nDuring the afternoon, however, his attention was directed to some\nsailors who were caulking a boat not far from the George's Dock. The\nboat he noticed was turned bottom upward, and that it had one end stove\nin; evidently it had had rough handling somewhere. And besides this,\nBenny noticed that there was a large quantity of hemp and tow on which\nthe sailors were kneeling while at their work. Several times during the\nafternoon he took a look at the sailors, and when at length he saw them\nlift up the boat and push the tow underneath, his mind was made up.\n\n\"Stunnin'!\" he ejaculated; \"I b'lieve we is in luck's way to-day.\nCouldna have bin better if it wer' a-made for us.\"\n\nPunctually at four o'clock the children were at their trysting-place.\nThey were both in high spirits, for their profits were larger than they\nhad been for many a day past. Benny especially was in high glee, for he\nhad the prospect of a comfortable lodging-place for the night, without\nany fear of his father's fury, and was consequently eager to communicate\nhis discovery to Nelly.\n\n\"Golly, Nell,\" was his greeting, using his favourite expression, \"it's a\nheap too cold to stick in one place. Let's off into Park Lane and git a\nfeed; we can 'ford it to-night.\"\n\nAnd off they started, hand in hand. The place to which they directed\ntheir steps was not the most select, the character of the customers\nbeing of no consequence, so long as the money was forthcoming. This fact\nwas well known to Benny, so he entered, leading his sister by the hand,\nwithout any trepidation. It was a long narrow room in which they found\nthemselves, with several small tables placed at regular intervals down\nthe sides. A bright fire was burning in the farther end of the room,\nnear which Benny took his seat, requesting that \"two penny loaves might\nbe brought, and a pennorth of cheese.\"\n\nThey remained as long as they felt they dared do so, then again sought\nthe wintry streets. But the keen frosty air made them long for shelter,\nand once more they sought the glowing grate of honest Joe Wrag. The\nold man seemed pleased to see them, and made room for them in his hut,\nthough he said little. Oh, how the fire glowed and crackled in the keen\nfrosty air, revealing to little Nelly Bates scenes of wondrous beauty!\nAnd as Joe watched her face glowing in the firelight, he muttered to\nhimself, \"Purty little hangel; I hopes she'll grow up good, or--or\ndie--ay, or die!\"\n\nIt was after eight o'clock when they left Joe's warm hut, for Nelly had\npleaded so hard to stay that he could not deny her request. She seemed\nto be twining herself around the old man's heart in a wonderful manner,\nand but for his fury of a wife he would have taken her to his own home\nwhen it became known to him that the children were homeless.\n\nIt did not take them long to reach the boat; and having satisfied\nthemselves that they were not noticed, they crept underneath in a\n\"jiffey,\" as Benny would have expressed it.\n\n\"Brimstone and treacle!\" said Benny, as he put his hand on the large\nheap of tow; \"ain't this sumpshus? We'll be as snug as Jonar 'ere.\"\n\n\"Ay, Benny, this is fine.\"\n\n\"Let's shut out all the daylight fust, Nell, an' then the cold won't git\nin.\"\n\nThanks to the abundance of tow this was not difficult, and soon the\nchildren were cuddled in each other's arms, feeling warmer than they had\nfelt for many a night past. It was a long time, however, before they\ncould get to sleep. To Nelly especially was it strange. And thoughts too\ndeep for them to express kept crowding into their minds, keeping them\nwide awake.\n\nAt length, however, a feeling of drowsiness began to creep over them,\nand they were just dropping off to sleep when they were startled by a\nfootstep near them, and a hoarse voice muttering, as if in anguish, \"O\nDeath, what dost thou mean?\"\n\nFor a moment the children clutched each other in terror; then they heard\nthe footsteps dying away in the distance, and their confidence returned\nagain.\n\n\"Who could it be?\" said Nelly.\n\n\"A bobby, I 'specks,\" said Benny; \"but he ain't catched us, so we's safe\n'nough now.\"\n\nFor awhile after they lay listening, but no other footsteps disturbed\nthem, and soon balmy sleep stole over them, sealing their eyelids, and\ngiving rest to their weary little heads and hearts.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nA Friend in Need.\n\n  Friendship, peculiar boon of heaven\n    The noble mind's delight and pride;\n  To men and angels only given,\n    To all the lower world denied.\n                     --Samuel Johnson.\n\n\nThe experiences of Benny and his sister during the next day were but\na repetition of what we recorded in the last chapter; but during the\nsecond night they found the shelter of the boat but a poor substitute\nfor a home, and in the morning they were stiff and cramped through\nlying so long in one position; and when they paid Joe Wrag their third\nmorning visit, the old man noticed that all was not right with them.\nNelly especially was gloomy and depressed.\n\nJoe Wrag was generally a silent man, and not given to asking many\nquestions; but when he saw great tears in Nelly's round eyes as she\nsat gazing into the fire, he felt that he must know what was troubling\nthe child, and help her if he could. He had also a dim suspicion that\nthey had not been to their home of late, and he wondered where they\ncould have spent their nights; and, like Benny, he dreaded the idea of\nlittle Nelly congregating with young thieves and vagabonds, and felt he\nwould rather a thousand times the child should die than that she should\ngrow up to be a wicked woman. So after reflecting for some time, and\nwondering how he should best get at the truth, he burst out suddenly\nwith the question,\n\n\"When were you last to hum, eh?\"\n\nFor a moment there was silence, and Benny looked at his sister as much\nas to say, \"That's a poser; we're in for it now.\"\n\n\"Come, now,\" said Joe, seeing their hesitation, \"let's 'ave nowt but\ntruth; out wi' it, an' it will be best in the end.\"\n\n\"You tell 'im, Nell,\" said Benny, \"'cause he'll b'lieve you.\"\n\nSo Nelly, in her sweet pleading voice, told him all the story of Benny's\nwrong, and of her father's cruelty, and how even she herself had not\nescaped his anger.\n\n\"And did he beat you, my purty?\" said Joe, clenching his fist tightly at\nthe same time.\n\n\"Ay, Joe; but I dunna think he know'd what he were a-doin'.\"\n\nFor a few moments the old man's face worked as if in pain. Then he\nmuttered to himself, \"Some'at must be done, an' no mistake; but what?\nEh, what?\" Then he looked at the children again. \"Don't yer think you'd\nbetter go to hum again to-night?\" he said; and he watched eagerly for\nthe effect of his question. Nelly was the first to speak.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she said; \"we should get it worse nor ever. Dad would a'most\nkill Benny.\" And the tears welled up into her eyes again.\n\n\"I's not goin' to risk it,\" said Benny stoutly. \"I's 'ad hidin's enough\nto last me a lifetime.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay,\" said Joe. \"I wonder, now----\" And he looked reflectively into\nthe fire.\n\n\"What are 'e a-wonderin' on?\" queried Benny.\n\nBut Joe was silent. He had evidently got hold of some idea which he was\ntrying to work out. At length he looked up and said,\n\n\"Now, away with yer, an' come here again this ev'ning at six o'clock.\nD'ye hear?\"\n\n\"Ay, ay,\" was the response; and away they bounded, leaving Joe alone to\nhis meditations.\n\nJoe remained some time after they were gone in one position, scratching\nhis head most vigorously, and would doubtless have remained much longer\nhad he not been disturbed by the men who had come to their work, and\nwho set him at liberty from his watch until darkness should again come\ndown upon the earth. Joe walked leisurely to his home as if burdened\nwith some great thought, ate his morning meal in silence, and then went\nto bed, and lay tossing for full two hours ere he could find a wink of\nsleep.\n\nJoe Wrag had been for many years a complete enigma to a number of\nwell-meaning people, who had become much interested in this silent and\nthoughtful man, and were anxious to know more about him than he cared\nto reveal. Several \"town missionaries\" had tried to make something out\nof him, but had utterly failed. He had never been known to enter a\nhouse of prayer, and whether in the matter of religious knowledge and\nbelief he was a heathen or a Christian was an open question; and yet,\nnotwithstanding this, he lived a life that in many respects was worthy\nof the imitation of many who made greater professions.\n\nIndeed, to be strictly accurate, Joe Wrag never made any profession\nwhatever of any kind, and yet he was as honest as the day, and as true\nas steel. Honest, not because \"honesty was the best policy.\" Nay,\npolicy never entered into his thoughts; but he was honest because he\ncould not be otherwise. His _soul_ was honest; and as for lying, he\nloathed it as he would loathe a viper. Nothing could tempt him to be\nuntruthful. In fact, he recoiled as if by instinct from everything mean\nand deceitful. What teaching he had received, or what influences had\nsurrounded him during his early life, we have never been able to gather.\nHe kept himself mostly to himself, and was silent about the past. Year\nby year he moved along the even tenour of his way, ever ready to do\na kindly deed when opportunity presented itself, but never thrusting\nhimself where he felt he might not be wanted. He had a perfect horror of\nappearing to be better than he really was; and it was thought that that\nwas his chief reason why he never made any profession of religion.\n\nAbout three o'clock Joe got up, and after partaking of a substantial\nmeal, wended his way to the neighbourhood of Copperas Hill. After\nturning several sharp corners, he found himself in a small court\ncontaining about half a dozen houses. Before one of the doors he paused\nfor a moment, then raised his stick, and gave a sharp rat-tat-tat. The\ndoor was instantly opened by a woman who had evidently reached her\nthreescore years and ten. Yet she appeared hale and strong for her age,\nand though poorly, was yet tidily attired.\n\n\"Well, ye are a stranger,\" was her greeting. \"I'm verra glad to see 'e,\nthough.\"\n\n\"An' I'm glad to see you, Betty.\"\n\n\"Well, come tha in. What's i' tha wind?\"\n\n\"Nowt much, Betty; but what thar is consarns you as much as me.\"\n\n\"Well, out wi' it, Joe,\" said Betty, as soon as Joe had seated himself.\n\"No trouble, I 'ope?\"\n\n\"No, not that I knows on; but could 'e make room 'ere for a couple o'\nlodgers--little 'uns, mind you--children, on'y 'bout so high?\" holding\nout his hand.\n\n\"Well, what an idear, to be sure! What are ye a-dreamin' on?\"\n\n\"Your old man,\" said Joe solemnly, \"was my mate for mony a year, an'\na good man he wur; an' if from that fur-off country he can see what's\ndoin' 'ere, he'd be mightily pleased for 'e to do, Betty, what I'm\na-axin' o' yer.\"\n\n\"But I dunno that I quite understand,\" said Betty; \"explain your meanin'\na bit more.\"\n\nAnd Joe, in a solemn voice, told the story of little Nell and her\nbrother Benny. \"It mebbe, Betty,\" he said, \"they're the Lord's little\n'uns. I'm none o' the Lord's mysel'. I've tried to find 'im; but He\nwinna be found o' me. I'm none o' the elect. I've settled that for\nmore'n twenty year now. But if these bairns are the Lord's, we mustna\nturn 'em away.\"\n\n\"All bairns are the Lord's,\" said Betty; but Joe only shook his head,\nand sat gazing into the fire.\n\nBefore he left, however, it was settled that a bed should be made for\nthe children in the corner under the stairs, which would be near the\nfire also. For this they were to pay a penny per night.\n\n\"We mustna make paupers o' them, you know, Betty,\" was Joe's remark.\n\nIt was also agreed that she should do what washing and mending the\nchildren's clothes needed, for which they were to pay also, if they\ncould afford it. \"If not,\" said Joe, \"I'll make it square wi' you,\nBetty.\"\n\nPunctually at six o'clock the children put in an appearance at Joe's\nhut. They had had but poor luck during the day, and Benny did not feel\nnearly so courageous as he had felt two days before. The prospect of\nsleeping night after night underneath a boat was not so inviting as\nhe had imagined it would be; besides, there was the fear that their\nhiding-place might be discovered, and that even this poor shelter might\nbe taken away from them at any time.\n\nHe did not confide his fears to Nelly; he felt that it would be cruel\nto do so; and she--whatever she may have felt--never uttered a single\nword of complaint. She knew that \"her Benny\" had enough to bear, and she\nwould not add to his burden.\n\nBenny had been very much puzzled at Joe Wrag's manner in the morning,\nand had wondered much during the day \"what he 'ad been a-turnin' over in\nhis noddle.\" He was desperately afraid that Joe would try to persuade\nhim and Nelly to return to their home, or even insist upon their doing\nso; and rather than do that, he felt that he would lose Joe's friendship\nand warm fireside into the bargain.\n\nJoe was looking very abstractedly into the grate when they came up\nto the fence, and for a moment they watched his rugged face with the\nfirelight playing upon it. But Benny, who could read his father's face\npretty cleverly, declared to himself that \"he could make nowt out o'\nJoe's.\"\n\nAs usual, Joe made room for Benny in his little hut; but to-night he\ntook little Nelly very tenderly on his knee, and stroked her long flaxen\nhair with his hard rough hand, muttering to himself the while, \"Purty\nlittle hangel; I reckon she's one o' the Lord's elect.\"\n\nBenny wondered for a long time when Joe was going to say something that\nhe could understand; but somehow to-night he did not like to disturb him\nby asking questions. Nelly, on the contrary, was far away again from the\ncold and dingy streets, and the ceaseless roar of the busy town, and\nwas wandering in imagination through sunny meadows where the turf was\nsoft and the grass was green. She fancied she heard the music of purling\nstreams, and the songs of happy birds in the leafy trees that waved\ntheir branches over her. The air was fragrant with the scent of flowers\nthat she had heard of, but never seen, and weariness and cold she felt\nno more.\n\nThe voice of Joe banished the beautiful vision from the glowing grate,\nand the child wondered if ever it would become a reality--if ever she\nwould dwell amid such scenes in a life that had no ending.\n\n\"I've some'at to say to 'e, my dears,\" was Joe's first exclamation; and\nthe children looked up into his face, and wondered what was coming next.\n\"I've found a hum for 'e, and a reet good 'un, an' ye'r to go to-night.\"\n\n\"Oh, scissors!\" shouted Benny; and he ran into the street, and had\nturned two somersaults ere he knew what he was doing; then stood on his\nhead for at least five seconds by way of cooling off, and what other\nperformances he might have gone through I cannot say, had not Joe called\nhim into the hut.\n\nLittle Nelly said nothing; she only nestled closer to her benefactor,\nand Joe felt great scalding tears dropping upon his hand, and knew that\nher heart was too full for her to speak. Then he told them all about\ntheir new home, and what would be expected of them, and how he hoped\nthey would be good and kind to the old woman, and always be honest and\ntruthful, and then when they died they might go to the good place.\n\n\"Does folks go somewheres when they die?\" said Benny, with a look of\nastonishment.\n\n\"Ay, Ben, that they do.\"\n\n\"Oh, beeswax and turpentine!\" he ejaculated, \"that are a go!\"\n\nBut Nelly's face grew luminous, and her eyes fairly sparkled, as she\nfaintly grasped the idea that perhaps her dreams might come true after\nall.\n\nThey had no difficulty in finding their way to Tempest Court, or in\ndiscovering the house of Betty Barker. The old woman gave them a rough\nthough kindly welcome, and Benny was soon at his ease. Their bed in\nthe warm corner under the stairs was, to use Benny's phrase, \"simply\nsumshus;\" and next morning when they appeared before Joe, it was with\nfaces glowing with gladness and delight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\"Oh, Death! what does thou mean?\"\n\n  To sleep! perchance to dream;--ay, there's the rub;\n  For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,\n  When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\n  Must give us pause.\n                             --Hamlet\n\n\nWe must now go back to the morning when Benny and his sister left their\nhome, and pay one more visit to \"Addler's Hall.\" Dick Bates got up in\nthe morning with a splitting headache, and, if the truth must be told,\nwith an aching heart. His sleep had been disturbed by horrid dreams,\nthe recollection of which haunted him still, and made him feel anything\nbut comfortable. He had dreamt that he had been working near the docks,\nand in going close to the edge of one of them he saw his two children\nrise to the surface of the water clasped in each other's arms; and while\nhe looked at them, they opened their glassy eyes and cast upon him one\nlingering, reproachful glance, then sank to the bottom again. Twice\nduring the night had this dream been repeated, and when he awoke in the\nmorning it was with a vague fear of impending evil. Dick Bates, like\nmany other hardened and cruel men, was at heart a great coward, besides\nbeing very superstitious. He listened several times for any movement\ndownstairs, but all was still; and this only increased his alarm, for he\nknew his children were in the habit of stirring early, and he saw by the\nlight that the morning was far advanced.\n\nWe may judge, therefore, of his alarm when, on coming downstairs, he\nfound the room empty, and he thought, with a terror in his heart that\nmade the perspiration ooze from his forehead, that perhaps his children\nhad been driven by his cruelty to put an end to their existence.\n\nHe tried to banish the thought as weak and childish, but he could not;\nhis nerves were completely unstrung to-day, and he did not seem at\nall himself. When his wife came down he sent her into the neighbours'\nhouses, and into Bowker's Row, to inquire if any one had seen them. But\neverywhere the same answer was given: no one had either seen them or\nheard them. His wife characterized his fears as \"bosh,\" and declared \"he\nwur wuss nor any owd woman. The brats'll turn up agin to-night, never\nfear,\" she said; and Dick sincerely hoped in his heart that they would\ndo so. He was too late to get any work that morning, so he spent most\nof the forenoon in the house, brooding over his fears. And while he sat\nthere on the low stool with his face buried in his hands, memories of\nother and happier years crowded in upon his brain. His boyhood life in\nthe country seemed to him now, as he looked back at it through a long\nvista of years, like a happy dream. And he was glad that his old father\nand mother were dead, and did not know how low he had fallen.\n\nThen he thought of the morning when he had led his first young bride to\nchurch, and of the few short years of happiness that had followed. He\nremembered, too, the promise he had made her on her dying bed--that he\nwould take care of the children, and meet her in heaven. Alas! how he\nhad belied those solemn words! He had not cared for his children, he\nadmitted to himself with shame; but, on the contrary, he had cruelly\nneglected them, had behaved towards them as the veriest brute. And now\nperhaps they were dead--driven to death by his cruelty.\n\nThen other thoughts took possession of him. \"If they're dead,\" he said,\n\"they are better off: what is there to live for? Better for 'em to die\nnow than to grow up to be like me an' Sall.\"\n\nThen he began to wonder what dying meant. \"If I wur sartin,\" he said,\n\"that there wur nowt arter death, I'd die too.\" And he got up and walked\nabout the room; after awhile he sat down again, and buried his face in\nhis hands once more. \"Mary used to say,\" he mused, \"that bad people went\nto a bad place an' was tormented for ever; but that if we was good, an'\ntrusted in the Saviour, we should go to 'eaven an' be 'appy for ever.\nAnd poor owd father and mother used to say t' same. I remembers it very\nwell! Ah me, I've nearly forgot all sense o' it, though.\"\n\nAnd thus he mused hour after hour, heedless that his wife swore and\nraved that \"the brats had eat all the butter, and walked off all the\ntaters.\"\n\nWhen, however, he was made to comprehend this fact, he became less\nconcerned about his children, and a little before noon he started off in\nsearch of work. But all the afternoon he was gloomy and depressed, and\ninstead of going to a public house, as was his wont when the day's work\nwas done, he set off home, much to the surprise of his mates, who grew\nwarm in a discussion as the evening advanced as to what \"'ad a-comed\nover Dick Bates.\"\n\nFrom seven to nine he sat in his own desolate home alone, for his wife\nwas in no humour to keep him company, and every patter of feet in the\ncourt made him start and look eagerly towards the door, in the hope that\nhe would see it open, and his children enter; but the door did not open,\nand his children never came.\n\n\"I wouldna a-minded so much,\" he said, \"if I hadna a-wolloped poor\nlittle Nell;\" and he vowed with a terrible oath that \"he would treat 'em\nbetter in t' future, if he ever had the chance.\"\n\nBut when the clock in the steeple not far away struck nine, he started\nup, muttering to himself, \"I canna stand this: I wonder what's comed to\nme? If 't bairns would come home, I reckon I'd be all right.\" But the\nbairns did not come, and he started out to get a glass, to help him to\ndrown remorse.\n\nHis mates tried to rally him, but they had to confess that it was \"no\ngo;\" and when at eleven o'clock he left them at the corner of the\nstreet, and once more directed his steps towards Addler's Hall, they\ntouched their foreheads significantly to each other, and whispered it as\ntheir opinion \"that Dick Bates was a-goin' wrong in his noddle, and was\nabove a bit luny.\"\n\nWhen he reached his home, he opened the door with a beating heart. All\nwas silent, save the heavy breathing of his wife in the room above.\nHe went to the dark corner where his children slept, and felt with\nhis hands; but the bed, such as it was, was empty, and with a groan he\nturned away and hid his face in his hands. And again his past life came\nback to him more vividly than it had done for years.\n\n\"I mun go an' look for 'em,\" he said. \"I shall see 'em floating in one\no' the docks, as I did last night in my dream.\" And with a feeling\nof despair in his heart he wandered forth again into the now almost\ndeserted streets.\n\nAs we have before stated, it was a clear frosty night; not a single\ncloud obscured the myriad stars that glittered in the deep vault\nof heaven. And as Dick Bates wandered under the light of the stars\nalong the long line of docks, no one would have believed that this\nanxious-faced man was the brutal drunkard that only on the previous\nnight punished his unoffending children without mercy.\n\nWas it God that was working in his heart, bringing back to him the\nmemories of other years, and awaking within him better thoughts? Who\nshall say it was not?\n\nStill on he went, starting continually as he fancied he saw something\nwhite on the dark still water. \"How nice it would be,\" he muttered, \"to\nsleep for ever! to be free fra the worry an' trouble.\" But how could he\nknow that death was endless sleep? Might it not be, as his Mary said it\nwas, the beginning of a life that should never end? He was now near the\nboat under which his children lay. It was his footstep that startled\nthem just as they were dropping off to sleep. It was his voice that\nmuttered the words, \"O Death! what dost thou mean?\"\n\nHow near father and children had come to each other! but neither knew of\nthe other's presence: then they drifted apart again, to meet no more on\nearth. There were only a few small vessels in the next dock, and all the\nlights were out.\n\n\"There they be, sure enough,\" said Dick, as something white, floating on\nthe surface of the water, caught his eye, and he went close up to the\nedge of the dock, forgetful of the fact that the huge damp coping stones\nhad, by the action of the frost, become as slippery as glass. He had\nscarcely planted his foot on one of the huge stones when it slipped from\nbeneath him; a piercing shriek rang out on the startled air, followed by\na plunge, a gurgling cry, and the cold water closed over him.\n\nA moment later a pale agonized face gleamed up from the dark water, a\nhurried prayer floated up on the cold frosty air, \"Saviour of my Mary,\nsave me!\" then the water closed over him again. Two other times, at\nlonger intervals, Dick Bates' agonized and horror-stricken face appeared\nfor a moment on the surface; then the ruffled waters grew smooth, hiding\nin their dark bosom the dead body of Richard Bates, whose soul had been\nso suddenly called to its account.\n\nThe next day the dead body was dragged to the surface, and conveyed\nto the dead-house, where it was claimed by his wife. An inquest and a\nfuneral followed, of which Benny and little Nell never knew. And it\nwas well, perhaps, they did not. The knowledge would have been pain to\nthe little waifs, and they had already as much trouble as their little\nhearts knew how to bear.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nIn which Benny makes a Discovery.\n\n  All unseen the Master walketh\n    By the toiling servant's side;\n  Comfortable words He speaketh,\n    While His hands uphold and guide.\n                           --Baynes.\n\n\nChristmas Day this year came upon a Wednesday, and, during the two days\npreceding it, Benny did what he characterized as a \"roaring bizness.\"\nThere were so many people leaving and arriving by all the ferry-boats\nand at all the stations, that our hero was kept on the trot nearly all\nthe time. His frank open face seemed to most people, who had a bag or a\nbundle to carry, a sufficient guarantee of his honesty, and they hoisted\ntheir bag upon the little fellow's shoulder without any fear that he\nwould attempt to pry into its contents, or make off with it round some\nsharp corner.\n\nFor a time the \"match business\" was turned over entirely to Nelly's\nmanagement; and though the modest little girl never pushed her\nwares--she was too shy for that--yet Benny declared she did \"stunnin'.\"\n\nMany a gentleman, catching just a glimpse of the pale sweet face as he\nhurried past, would turn to have another look at the child, and, without\ntaking any of her fusees, would put a penny, and sometimes more, into\nthe little thin hand. And Nelly would courtesy her thanks, unable to\nutter a word.\n\nBenny declared \"he liked Christmas-time 'mazin' well, and wondered why\nfolks didn't have Christmas a sight oftener than once a year.\" How it\nwas that coppers were so much more plentiful at this time of the year\nthan at any other time was to him a mystery. Poor little fellow! the\nthought never seemed to enter into his small head that it might be that\npeople's hearts were more open at this festive season than at some\nother times. However, Benny was not one that speculated long on such\nquestions; he only wished that people were always as ready to have their\nbags carried, and always gave their pence as ungrudgingly. Once or\ntwice he felt a bit sad, and brushed away a hasty tear, when he saw boys\nno bigger than himself wrapped up in great warm overcoats, and beautiful\nlittle girls with fur-trimmed jackets and high-heeled dainty boots,\nclasped in the arms of their parents as soon as they stepped from the\nferry, and then hurried away to a cab or to a carriage in waiting--and\nthen thought of his own cheerless life. \"I specks they's mighty 'appy,\"\nhe said reflectively, and then hurried away to the other end of the\nstage, where he thought he saw the chance of employment.\n\nOn Christmas Eve Benny took his sister through St. John's Market, and\nhighly delighted they were with what they saw. The thousands of geese,\nturkeys, and pheasants, the loads of vegetables, the heaps of oranges\nand apples, the pyramids of every other conceivable kind of fruit, the\nstalls of sweetmeats, the tons of toffee, and the crowds of well-dressed\npeople all bent upon buying something, were sources of infinite pleasure\nto the children. There was only one drawback to their happiness, and\nthat was they did not know how to lay out the sixpence they had brought\nwith them to spend. If there had been less variety there would have been\nless difficulty; but, as it was, Benny felt as if he would never be able\nto decide what to buy. However, they agreed at last to lay out twopence\nin two slices of bread and ham, for they were both rather hungry; and\nthen they speculated the other fourpence in apples, oranges, and\ntoffee, and, on the whole, felt very well satisfied with the results of\ntheir outlay.\n\nIt was rather later than usual when they got home, but old Betty knew\nwhere they had gone, and, as it was Christmas Eve, she had got a bigger\nfire in than usual, and had also got them a cup of hot cocoa each, and\nsome bun loaf to eat with it.\n\n\"By golly!\" said Benny, as he munched the cake, \"I do wish folks 'ud\n'ave Christmas ev'ry week.\"\n\n\"You are a cur'us boy,\" said the old woman, looking up with a smile on\nher wrinkled face.\n\n\"Is I, granny? I specks it's in my blood, as the chap said o' his timber\nleg.\"\n\nThe old woman had told them on the first evening of their arrival, when\nthey seemed at a loss what name to give her, to call her granny; and no\nname could have been more appropriate, or have come more readily to the\nchildren's lips.\n\n\"But could folks have Christmas any oftener if they wished to?\" asked\nlittle Nell.\n\n\"In course they could, Nell,\" burst out Benny. \"You dunna seem to know\nwhat folks make Christmas for.\"\n\n\"An I thinks as you dunno either, Benny.\"\n\n\"Don't I, though?\" he said, putting on an air of importance. \"It's made\nto give folks the chance of doing a lot o' feeding; didn't yer see all\nthe gooses an' other nice things in the market that the folks is going\nto polish off to-morrow?\"\n\n\"I dunna think it was made purpose for that. Wur it, now, granny?\"\n\nThus appealed to, the old woman, who had listened with an amused smile\non her face, answered,\n\n\"No, my child. It's called Christmas 'cause it is the birthday of\nChrist.\"\n\n\"Who's He?\" said Benny, looking up; and Nelly's eyes echoed the inquiry.\n\n\"Don't you know--ain't you never heerd?\" said the old woman, in a tone\nof surprise.\n\n\"Nay,\" said Benny; \"nothin' sense. Some o' the chaps says 'by Christ' as\nI says 'by golly'; but I never knowed He was somebody.\"\n\n\"Poor little dears! I didn't know as how you was so ignorant, or I\nshould have told you before.\" And the old woman looked as if she did not\nknow where or how to begin to tell the children the wonderful story, and\nfor a considerable time remained silent. At length she said, \"I'll read\nit to 'e out o' the Book; mebbe you'll understand it better that way nor\nany way else.\"\n\nAnd, taking down from her shelf her big and much-worn Bible, she opened\nit at the second of St. Matthew, and began to read in a tremulous\nvoice,--\n\n\"Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Jud\u00c3\u00a6a in the days of Herod the\nking, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying,\nWhere is He that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in\nthe east, and are come to worship Him.\"\n\nAnd slowly the old woman read on until she reached the end of the\nchapter, while the children listened with wide-open and wondering eyes.\nTo Nelly the words seemed to come like a revelation, responding to the\ndeepest feeling of her nature, and awakening thoughts within her that\nwere too big for utterance. Benny, however, on the contrary, could see\nnothing particularly interesting in the narrative itself. But the art of\nreading was to him a mystery past all comprehension. How granny could\nsee that story upon the page of her Bible was altogether beyond his\ngrasp. At length, after scratching his head vigorously for some time, he\nburst out,--\n\n\"By jabbers! I's got it at last!--Jimmy Jones squeeze me if I ain't!\nIt's the specks that does it.\"\n\n\"Does what?\" said Nelly.\n\n\"Why, the story bizness, to be sure. Let me look at the book through\nyour specks, shall I, granny?\"\n\n\"Ay, if you like, Benny.\" And the next minute he was looking at the\nBible with granny's spectacles upon his nose, with a look of blank\ndisappointment upon his face.\n\n\"Golly! I's sold!\" was his exclamation. \"But this are a poser, and no\nmistake.\"\n\n\"What's such a poser?\" said granny.\n\n\"Why, how yer find the story in the book; for I can see nowt.\" And Benny\nlooked as disappointed as if he had earned nothing for a week.\n\nBy much explaining, however, granny enabled him to comprehend in some\nvague way how the mystery was accomplished; and then arose within the\nheart of the child an unutterable longing to understand this mysterious\nart fully, and be able to read for himself--a longing that grew in\nintensity as evening after evening he tried, by granny's help, to master\nthe alphabet. In fact, it became a passion with the lad, and many an\nhour in the weeks and months that followed he spent gazing at the\nplacards on the walls, and in trying to explain to the other Arabs that\ngathered around him the meaning of the mysterious characters.\n\nBenny was naturally a sharp lad, and hence, though his opportunities\nwere few, his progress was by no means slow. Sometimes he startled Joe\nWrag by spelling out a long word that he had carried in his head the\nwhole of the day, and asking its meaning. Long words had an especial\nfascination for him, and the way he brought them out in all sorts of\nconnections was truly amusing.\n\nNelly manifested no desire to learn to read. If ever she thought about\nit, it was only to regard it as something infinitely beyond her\ncapabilities; and she seemed content to remain as she was. But if she\ncould get granny to read to her a chapter out of St. John's Gospel,\nshe seemed to desire no higher pleasure. She would sit with a dreamy\nfar-away look in her half-closed eyes, and the smiles that old Joe Wrag\nloved to see would come and go upon her face like patches of spring\nsunshine chasing each other across a plain. She never said very much,\nbut perhaps she thought all the more. To honest Joe Wrag she seemed as\nif ripening for a fairer country, and for a purer and nobler life. Not\nthat she ailed anything. True, she had a little hacking cough now and\nthen, and when she lay asleep a pink spot would glow on either cheek;\nbut nothing more than that.\n\n\"Speretual things,\" mused Joe Wrag one night, as he sat in the door of\nhis hut looking into the fire, \"are speretually discerned, an' I b'lieve\nthat child 'as rale speretual discernment: she looks a mighty sight\ndeeper than we thinks she do, that's my opinion. I should like to get\nhowld o' all that passes through her purty little noddle, the little\nhangel--bless her! As for the boy, 'e's a little hanimal. I reckon\nthe passons would call him a materialist. I don't b'lieve 'e b'lieves\nnothing but what 'e sees. No speretual insight in 'im--not a bit. P'raps\nhe's like me, don't belong to the elect. Ah, me! I wonder what the likes\no' us was born for?\"\n\nAnd Joe went out, and heaped more fuel on the fire by way of diverting\nhis thoughts from a subject that was always painful to him. But when he\ncame back and sat down again, and the fire before him blazed up with\nfiercer glow, the thoughts returned, and would not be driven away.\n\n\"Bless her!\" he said. \"She sees in the fire only woods, an' meadows,\nan' mountains, an' streams; an' I only see the yawning caverns o' hell.\nAn' to think I must burn in a fire a thousan' times bigger an' hotter\nthan that for ever and ever without a single moment's ease; scorching\non every side, standin' up or lyin' down, always burnin'! No water, no\nlight, no mercy, no hope. An' when a million million years are past,\nstill burning, an' no nearer the end than at the beginnin'. Oh, how\nshall I bear it--how shall I bear it?\"\n\nAnd big drops of perspiration oozed from his forehead and rolled down\nhis face, testifying to the anguish of his soul.\n\n\"I canna understand it--I canna understand it,\" he went on. \"All this\npain and suffering for His glory. What kind o' glory can it be, to bring\nfolks into the world doomed aforehand to eternal misery? to give 'em\nno chance o' repentance, an' then damn them for ever 'cause they don't\nrepent! O Lord a mercy, excuse me, but I canna see no justice in it\nanywhere.\"\n\nAnd once more Joe got up and began to pace up and down in front of the\nfire; but the thoughts would not leave him. \"'Whom He did foreknow,'\" he\nwent on, \"'them also He did predestinate.' Mighty queer, that a Father\nshould love a part o' His fam'ly an' hate the rest. Create 'em only to\nburn 'em for ever an' ever! An' what's the use o' the burnin'? That\nbangs me complete. If 't was to burn away the dross an' leave the metal,\nI could understand it. I think sometimes there's jist a bit o' the right\nstuff in me; an' if hell would burn up the bad an' leave the good, an'\ngive it a chance of some'at better, there 'ud be more justice in it,\nseems to me. But what am I a-saying? It shows as how I'm none o' the\nelect, to be talking to myself in this way. What a wicked old sinner I\nbe!\"\n\nAnd once more Joe sat down with a jerk, as if he meant to say, \"I'm not\ngoing to be bothered with such thoughts any more to-night.\" But alas! he\nfound that thoughts would come, whether he would or no.\n\n\"Pr'aps,\" he said, \"we don't know nowt about it, none o' us. Mebbe God\nis more marcyfuller than we think. An' I'm sadly banged about that\n'makin' an end o' sin;' I don't see as how He can make an end o' sin\nwithout making an end o' the sinner; an' whiles there is millions sich\nas me in hell, there'll be no end to neither on 'em. I'm sadly out in my\nreck'nin' somewheres, but 'pears to me if there was no sinners there 'ud\nbe no sin; an' the way to rid the univarse of sinners is to get 'em all\nsaved or kill 'em outright.\"\n\nMuch more to the same effect Joe Wrag turned over in his mind that\nnight, but we must not weary the reader with his speculations. Like many\nother of God's children, he was crying in the darkness and longing for\nlight. He had found that human creeds, instead of being a ladder leading\nup into the temple of truth, were rather a house of bondage. Men had\nspread a veil before the face of God, and he had not courage to pull it\naside. Now and then through the rents he caught a ray of light, but it\ndazzled him so that he was afraid there was something wrong about it,\nand he turned away his face and looked again into the darkness. And yet\nthe night was surely passing away. It wanted but a hand to take down the\nshutters from the windows of his soul, and let the light--ay, and the\nlove of God that surrounded him, like a mighty ocean--rush in. But whose\nhand should take down the shutters? Through what agency should the light\ncome in? Let us wait and see.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nTwo Visits.\n\n  Tell me the story slowly,\n    That I may take it in;\n  That wonderful redemption,\n    God's remedy for sin.\n  Tell me the story simply,\n    As to a little child;\n  For I am weak and weary,\n   And helpless and defiled.\n                 --Hankey.\n\n\nOne clear frosty evening early in the new year two little figures\nmight have been seen threading their way along Old Hall Street, in\nthe opposite direction to the Exchange. It had not long gone five,\nand numbers of clerks and warehousemen were crowding into the street\nand hurrying in the direction of their several homes. But the little\nfigures dodged their way with great skill through the crowded street,\nstill holding each other by the hand and keeping up most of the time a\nsharp trot.\n\nAfter pursuing a straight course for a considerable time, they turned\noff suddenly to the right into a less frequented street. Then they took\na turn to the left, and then again to the right. It was very evident\nthey knew the streets well, for they wound in and out, now right, now\nleft, without the least hesitation.\n\nAt length they reached a street where all was darkness, save where\nhere and there the flickering rays of a candle struggled through the\ndirt-begrimed window. This was Bowker's Row, and Benny and his sister\npaused for awhile before venturing into the darkness.\n\nFor several days their little hearts had been aching with curiosity\nto visit once more their old home. They had no wish to be seen, and\nas for living again in Addler's Hall, that was altogether out of the\nquestion. Still, they were filled with a curiosity that they could not\nresist to peep at the old spot once more, and ascertain, if possible,\nhow far their father and stepmother were pleased or otherwise with their\ndisappearance.\n\nThey had talked the matter over for several nights as they lay in each\nother's arms in the warm corner under Betty Barker's stairs. They\nadmitted that there were difficulties, perhaps danger, in paying such\na visit; but at length curiosity became too strong for them, and they\nresolved to risk it.\n\nWith Nelly, too, there was something more than curiosity.\nNotwithstanding his drunken habits and his cruelty to Benny, she loved\nher father, for there had been times when he had made much of her,\nand called her \"his little Nell.\" Perhaps she did not love her father\nvery deeply. In comparison to \"her Benny,\" he occupied indeed a very\nthird-rate place in her affections. Still he was her father, and now\nand then he had been kind to her, and hence he was more to her than a\nstranger, and her little heart longed for one more sight of his face.\nThey did not wait long at the end of Bowker's Row. Ascertaining that\nthe coast was tolerably clear, they darted up the street, and without\nany one recognizing them, turned into Addler's Hall. From the window of\ntheir late home a feeble light struggled, which satisfied them that the\nhouse was not empty.\n\n\"Take care,\" said Benny to his sister, \"an' don't make no noise if yer\ncan 'elp it.\"\n\n\"Right you are,\" whispered his sister, and with silent footfalls they\nglided up to the door and listened.\n\nFrom within came the sound of voices, but they were the voices of\nchildren--strange voices, too, they were.\n\nAnd Benny looked at his sister and whispered--\n\n\"By golly! this are a go. The owd folks 'ave flit, that's sartin.\"\n\n\"Can yer get a peep through the winder, Benny?\" said Nelly, with a\nwhite, startled face.\n\n\"Dunno, but I'll try;\" and try he did, but without success.\n\n\"Brimstone!\" he whispered, scratching his head; \"what's us to do? Oh, I\n'ave it,\" he said at length. \"Come 'ere, Nell. I's 'mazin' strong, an' I\ncan lift you 'igh 'nough to get a peep.\"\n\nAnd, taking his sister in his arms, he managed, not without considerable\ndifficulty, to enable her to look through the window and get a glimpse\nof the inmates of the room.\n\n\"Do 'e know 'em, Nell?\" said Benny, after he had lifted her down very\ncarefully.\n\n\"No, I dunno who they is; I've never seen 'em afore.\"\n\n\"Well, then, we'll ax 'em.\" And without further ado he pushed open the\ndoor.\n\nThere were four hungry and neglected-looking children in the room,\nthe oldest of them about the same age as Benny. They looked up with\nquestioning eyes at the intruders, but said nothing.\n\n\"Does you live 'ere?\" said Benny, putting on a bold face.\n\n\"Ay,\" was the response from all together.\n\n\"How long?\" said Benny.\n\n\"Week afore last,\" answered the oldest lad.\n\n\"Where's the folks as lived 'ere afore you comed?\"\n\n\"Dunno.\"\n\n\"Ain't you ever heerd?\"\n\n\"Ay, we've heerd.\"\n\n\"Where is they, then?\" queried Benny.\n\n\"Childer is drownded.\"\n\n\"Golly! are that so?\" and there was an amused twinkle in Benny's eye as\nhe put the question.\n\n\"Ay,\" was the response; \"we's heerd so.\"\n\n\"Where's their faather?\" was Benny's next question.\n\n\"Dunno,\" said the biggest lad.\n\n\"Ain't you heerd?\"\n\n\"Ay, we 'ave.\"\n\n\"Where is he, then?\"\n\n\"Well, faather says he's gone to Davy Jones, but I dunno where that are.\"\n\n\"Nor I too,\" said Benny, scratching his head. Then he looked at the\noldest lad again.\n\n\"Did the man's missus go wi' him, does yer know?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Never heerd nothing 'bout 'er,\" said the lad.\n\n\"An' yer knows nothin' more 'bout 'em?\"\n\n\"No, nothin'.\"\n\n\"Mich 'bliged,\" said Benny, with an air of importance. And taking Nelly\nby the hand, he walked out of the house.\n\nHe hardly knew whether he was most pleased or disappointed with his\nvisit, so he said nothing to his sister until they had left Bowker's\nRow behind them, and got once more into the region of gaslight. Then,\nturning to his sister, he said,\n\n\"What does yer think o' it now, Nell?\"\n\n\"P'r'aps father's mended, and 'as gone to live in a better 'ouse,\" was\nthe quiet reply.\n\n\"Mos' likely,\" said Benny, and again they trudged on in silence.\n\nAt length they paused in front of a chapel that abutted close on to the\nstreet. A few people were dropping in quietly one after another, and\nBenny wondered what they did inside. He had never been inside a church\nor a chapel; they were most of them so grand, and the people that went\nwere dressed so well, that he had concluded long since that they were\nnot for such poor little chaps as he. But this chapel was anything but\ngrand-looking, and the people who were going in did not look very smart,\nand Benny began to wonder if he might not dare take a peep inside.\n\nWhile he was speculating as to what he had better do, a gentleman who\nhad been standing in the vestibule came out, and said in a kindly voice,\n\n\"Well, my little ones, would you like to come inside?\"\n\n\"May us?\" said Benny, eagerly.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" was the reply; \"we shall be very glad to see you, and there\nis plenty of room; come this way.\"\n\nAnd without a word they followed him.\n\n\"Here,\" he said, pushing open a green baize door, \"I will put you in my\npew; you will be nice and comfortable there, and none of my family will\nbe here to-night.\"\n\nFor a few moments the children hardly knew whether they were awake or\ndreaming; but at length they mustered up sufficient courage to look\naround them.\n\nThe place they thought was very large, but everything felt so snug and\nwarm that they almost wished they could stay there all night. Still the\npeople dropped in very quietly and orderly, until there were between\ntwo and three hundred present. Then a gentleman opened the organ and\nbegan to play a voluntary; softly at first, then louder, swelling out in\nrich full tones, then dying away again, like the sighing of a summer's\nbreeze; anon bursting forth like the rushing of a storm, now rippling\nlike a mountain rill, now wailing as a child in pain; now rushing on as\nwith shouts of gladness and thanksgiving, and again dying away like the\nwind in far-off trees.\n\nNelly listened with open mouth and wondering eyes, oblivious to\neverything but the strains of music that were floating all around her.\nAnd Benny sat as if transfixed.\n\n\"By golly!\" he whispered to Nelly, when the piece was ended, \"if I ever\nheerd sich music as that afore. It's made me cold all over; seems to me\nas if some one were pouring cold water adown my back.\"\n\nBut Nelly answered nothing; her attention was attracted to a gentleman\nthat stood alone on a platform with a book in his hand. Nelly thought\nhis voice was strangely musical as he read the words,--\n\n \"Jesus, lover of my soul,\n    Let me to Thy bosom fly,\n  While the nearer waters roll,\n    While the tempest still is high.\n  Hide me, O my Saviour, hide,\n    Till the storm of life be past;\n  Safe into the haven guide:\n    Oh, receive my soul at last.\"\n\nThen all the people stood up to sing, and the children thought they had\nnever heard anything half so sweet before. Great tears welled up in\nNelly's brimming eyes and rolled down her cheeks; though if any one had\nasked her why she wept, she would not have been able to tell.\n\nThen followed a prayer full of devout thanksgiving and of earnest\npleading. Then came another hymn--\n\n \"Would Jesus have a sinner die?\n    Why hangs He then on yonder tree?\n  What means that strange expiring cry?\n    Sinners, He prays for you and me:\n  Forgive them, Father, oh! forgive;\n    They know not that by Me they live.\"\n\nAnd once more the congregation stood up to sing. Nelly was even more\naffected than during the singing of the previous hymn, and while they\nsang the last verse--\n\n \"Oh, let me kiss His bleeding feet,\n    And bathe and wash them with my tears,\n  The story of His love repeat\n    In every drooping sinner's ears,\n  That all may hear the quick'ning sound,\n    Since I, even I, have mercy found,\"--\n\nshe fairly broke down, and, hiding her face in her hands, she sobbed\naloud.\n\nShe soon recovered herself, however, when the preacher began to speak.\nClear and distinct his words rang out:--\n\n\"Let the wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts,\nand let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and\nto our God, for He will abundantly pardon.\"\n\nAnd Nelly eagerly drank in his words as he went on to tell how we were\nall wanderers from our Father's house; and how the Father's heart\nyearned towards us, and how He had invited all to return home, giving\nthe same invitation to every one of His children, and promising an\nabundant pardon to all that would come. And then he told, by way of\nillustration, the beautiful parable of the Prodigal Son, and concluded\nwith an earnest exhortation to all the unsaved to come to the Saviour\nthat very night, and to come just as they were.\n\nNelly felt that she would very much like to \"come to the Saviour,\" but,\nalas! she did not know how. And when she saw several persons leave\ntheir pews and kneel around the communion, she wondered if they were\n\"prodigals going home to the Father.\"\n\nBut what of Benny? Alas! if Joe Wrag had seen him that evening, he would\nhave been more than ever convinced that he was none of the elect, and\nthat he had not one particle of spiritual discernment. The words of the\npreacher seemed to have a very soothing influence upon our hero, for\nscarcely had he uttered twenty words of the sermon ere Benny was fast\nasleep. Nor did he wake again till near the end of the service, when he\nwas startled by a strange voice speaking.\n\nIt was one of the men that Nelly had noticed kneeling at the communion.\nThe man stood up, and with a face radiant with his new-found joy, he\nsaid, in broken accents,\n\n\"Oh, friends, thank the Lord for me, for I have found the Saviour!\"\n\nEvidently he intended to have said more, but, overcome by his emotion,\nhe sat down and hid his face in his hands.\n\n\"I'm glad the chap found 'im,\" said Benny to his sister, as they hurried\nhomeward, \"for he seemed desp'rate cut up 'bout it.\"\n\nBut Nelly did not answer, she was too full of what she had seen, and\nheard, and felt, to speak.\n\nThe next evening, long before service-time, they were waiting around the\nchapel door, and when at length the door was opened, they were welcomed\nby the same gentleman that had spoken to them the previous evening, and\nput into the same pew. And once more was Benny delighted with the music,\nand once more was he soothed to sleep by the sermon.\n\nBut not so Nelly. As the preacher explained that wonderful text, \"For\nGod so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that\nwhosoever believeth in Him might not perish, but have everlasting life,\"\nshe seemed to see more clearly what the preacher meant on the previous\nnight. And while he dwelt on the word \"whosoever,\" she felt that she was\nincluded in this invitation of mercy. In fact, it seemed to her as if a\ngreat deal the preacher had said had been for her special benefit, and\nthat for _her_ the Saviour had provided a home more beautiful than any\nof the pictures she had seen in Joe Wrag's fire.\n\nAs they were leaving, near the close of the service, a young gentleman\nplaced his hand on Benny's shoulder, and said,\n\n\"Well, my little man, I hope you have found the Saviour.\"\n\n\"Lor' a massy!\" said Benny, with a look of surprise upon his face,\n\"are that little chap lost agin? He can't be well looked arter, that's\nsartin.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" said the young man; \"but perhaps I should have\nasked if the Saviour has found you?\"\n\n\"Not that I knows on,\" said Benny stoutly. \"Nobody finds me, I finds\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" said the young man, \"you mistake my meaning altogether.\"\n\n\"Does I?\"\n\n\"Yes, my little fellow. But I will talk with you again some other time,\nwhen there is more time.\"\n\n\"Will yer?\"\n\n\"Yes; but now good night.\"\n\n\"Good night,\" said Benny and Nelly in chorus, and once more they left\nthe warm house of prayer for the cold and wintry street.\n\n\"You would understand better, Benny,\" said his sister, as they journeyed\nhomeward, \"if yer would listen to granny, an' not go to sleep whiles the\nman is talkin'.\"\n\n\"Dunno that I should, Nell. I's not 'cute 'bout those things like you\nis; but let's 'urry on, for I's gettin' as cold as Jonar in the den o'\nlions.\"\n\nBenny was very fond of Old Testament stories, and granny had humoured\nhis liking in this respect, but the way he mixed up the prophets,\npatriarchs, and other noted Bible characters, was rather bewildering.\n\n\"Never mind,\" he would say, when granny took him to task on this matter,\n\"so long's I gets hold o' the right hend o' the story, mixin' up the\nnames a bit makes no matter, as fur as I can see.\"\n\nSo granny let him have his way, concluding that he would mend in that\nmatter as he got older.\n\n\"But,\" the old woman would say, \"he'll never be like little Nelly. Bless\nher! I's afeard, sometimes, she's too good an' knowin' to live.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nIn which Joe Wrag has a Vision.\n\n  They are going, only going,\n    Jesus called them long ago\n  All the wintry time they're passing\n    Softly as the falling snow.\n\n  When the violets in the spring-time\n    Catch the azure of the sky,\n  They are carried out to slumber\n    Sweetly where the violets lie.\n\n\nAs winter slowly wore away, little Nelly's health began to fail. She\nseemed weary and languid, and poor little Benny was at his wits' end to\nknow what to get her to eat. After spending more than he could really\nafford in something that he thought would tempt her appetite, he was\ngrieved beyond measure when she would turn away her head and say,\n\n\"I's very sorry for yer, Benny, but I canna eat it; I would if I could.\"\n\nAnd he would be compelled reluctantly to eat it himself, though he would\nnot mind going without food altogether if only \"little Nell\" could eat.\nBut he comforted himself with the thought that she would get better when\nthe spring-time came, and the streets were dry and warm. He might get\nher into the parks, too, and she would be sure, he thought, to get an\nappetite then. And so he kept up his spirits, and hoped for the best.\n\n\"She's ripenin' for the kingdom,\" was Joe Wrag's reflection, as he\nwatched her pale face becoming thinner, and her great round eyes\nbecoming larger and more luminous day by day. \"She belongs to the elect,\nthere ken be no doubt, an' the Lord don't intend for her little bare\nfeet to walk the cold, dirty streets o' Liverpool much longer. I reckon\nshe'll soon be walking the golden streets o' the shinin' city, where\nthere's no more cold, nor hunger, nor pain. I shall be main sorry to\nlose her, bless her little heart, for I'm feared there's no chance of\nme ever seein' her agin' when she's gone. I wonder if the Lord would\npermit me to look at her through the bars o' the gate just for a minit\nif I wur to ax Him very hard? 'T will be nice, anyhow, to think o' her\nbein' comforted while I'm tormented. But it comes 'ard 'pon such as us\nas don't belong to the elect, whichever way we looks at it.\"\n\nSometimes Joe would leave his home earlier in the afternoon than usual,\nand getting a nice bunch of grapes, he would make his way towards\nNelly's stand as the short winter's day was fading in the west. He would\nrarely have much difficulty in finding his little pet, and taking her up\nin his great strong arms, he would carry her off through bye-streets to\nhis hut. And wrapping her in his great warm overcoat, and placing her on\na low seat that he had contrived for her, he would leave her to enjoy\nher grapes, while he went out to light the fire and see that the lamps\nwere properly set for the night.\n\nWith a dreamy look in her eyes, Nelly would watch her old friend\nkindling his fire and putting things \"ship-shape,\" as he termed it, and\nwould think how well she had been cared for of late.\n\nBy-and-bye, when the fire crackled and glowed in the grate, Joe would\ncome into the hut and take her upon his knee, and she would lean her\nhead against his shoulder with a heart more full of thankfulness than\nwords of hers could utter. And at such times, at her request, Joe would\ntell her of the mercy that was infinite, and of the love that was\nstronger than death. She had only been twice to the chapel, for when\nshe and Benny went the following week they discovered that there was\nno service, and so disappointed were they that they had not gone again;\nfor the chapel was a long distance from Tempest Court, and she was tired\nwhen the day's work was done, and to go such a long distance and find\nthe doors closed was anything but inviting. So they had not ventured\nagain. But Nelly had heard enough from granny and while at the chapel to\nmake her thirst for more. And so Joe became her teacher, and evening by\nevening, whenever opportunity presented, he unfolded to her the \"old,\nold story of Jesus and His love.\"\n\nIt made his heart ache, though, to talk of the \"good tidings of great\njoy,\" and think they were not for him. If the truth must be told, this\nwas the reason why he kept away from church and chapel. He had adopted\nin early life the Calvinistic creed, and had come to the conclusion,\nwhen about thirty years of age, that he belonged to the \"eternally\nreprobate.\" Hence, to go to church to listen to promises that were not\nfor him, to hear offers of salvation that he could not accept, to be\ntold of a heaven that he could never enter, and of a hell that he could\nnot shun, was more than his sensitive nature could bear.\n\nAnd yet, as he repeated to Nelly the wonderful promises of the Gospel,\nthey seemed sometimes to widen out, until they embraced the whole world,\nincluding even him, and for a moment his heart would throb with joy and\nhope. Then again the bossy front of his creed would loom up before him\nlike an iron wall, hiding the light, shutting out the sunshine, and\nleaving him still in \"outer darkness.\"\n\nOne day Nelly rather startled him by saying, in her sweet childish way,\n\n\"I does like that word who-so-ever!\"\n\n\"Do you?\" said Joe.\n\n\"Oh, yes, very much; don't you?\"\n\n\"Well, I 'ardly knows what to make on it.\"\n\n\"How is that, Joe?\" said Nelly, looking up with a wondering expression\non her face.\n\n\"Well, 'cause it seems to mean what it don't mean,\" said Joe, jerking\nout the words with an effort.\n\n\"Oh, no, Joe; how can that be?\"\n\n\"Well, that's jist where I'm floored, Nelly. But it seem to be the fact,\nanyhow.\"\n\n\"Oh, Joe! And would the Saviour you've been a-tellin' me of say what He\ndidna mean?\" And a startled expression came over the child's face, as if\nthe ground was slipping from beneath her.\n\n\"No, no, Nelly, He could not say that; but the pinch is about what the\nword do mean.\"\n\n\"Oh, the man in the chapel said it meaned everybody, an' I reckon he\nknows, 'cause he looked as if he wur sartin.\"\n\n\"Did he, Nelly? Then perhaps he wur right.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, it's everybody, Joe. I feels as if it wur so inside.\"\n\n\"Purty little hangel!\" said Joe, in an undertone. \"But there are\nsomethin' in the Book about 'out of the mouths of babes an' sucklings.'\nI'll read it again when I gets home.\"\n\nThat night, as Joe Wrag sat in his hut alone, while the silence of the\nslumbering town was unbroken, save for the echoing footfall of the\npoliceman on his beat, he seemed to see the iron wall of his creed\nmelt and vanish, till not a shred remained, and beyond where it stood\nstretched endless plains of light and glory. And arching the sky from\nhorizon to horizon, a rainbow glowed of every colour and hue, and in\nthe rainbow a promise was written in letters of fire, and as he gazed\nthe letters burst forth into brighter flame, and the promise was this,\n\"Whosoever cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast them out.\" And over\nthe distant hills a great multitude appeared in sight--so many, indeed,\nthat he could not number them. But he noticed this, that none of them\nwere sick, or feeble, or old. No touch of pain was on any face, no line\nof care on any brow, and nearer and yet nearer they came, till he could\nhear the regular tramp, tramp of their feet, and catch the words they\nwere chanting as if with one voice. How thankful he was that the great\ntown was hushed and still, so that he could not mistake the words. \"And\nthe Spirit and the Bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come.\nAnd let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the\nwater of life freely.\" And still nearer their echoing footfalls came,\nwhen suddenly the glowing arch of fire in his grate fell together, and a\npoliceman passing his hut with measured tread, shouted,--\n\n\"Good night, Joe. We shall have a storm, I reckon; the wind has got up\nterrible during the last hour.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay,\" responded Joe, rubbing his eyes and wondering for a moment\nwhat had come over him.\n\n\"You seem hardly awake, Joe,\" laughed the policeman.\n\n\"Believe I 'ave nodded a bit,\" said Joe. \"But, bless me, how the wind do\nhowl!\"\n\n\"Yes, it'll be rough outside the 'bar,' I reckon. I hope we shall have\nno wrecks. Good night.\"\n\n\"Good night,\" said Joe, as he staggered out of his hut to mend the fire,\nwhich done, he sat down to reflect.\n\n\"Wur it a vision,\" he soliloquized, \"or wur it a dream, or wur it\n'magination? Wur it given to teach or to mislead me? But, lor', how\nbright that promise did shine! I ken see it now. It are in the Bible,\ntoo, that's the queerest part on it. An' how beautiful they did sing,\nan' how they did shout out that part, 'Whosoever will.' Lor' bless us!\nI can't get it out o' my noddle; nor I dunno that I want to, it's so\namazin' comfortin', and much more nearer my idear of what God ought to\nbe, 'cause as how there is no limit to it.\"\n\nAnd Joe scratched his head vigorously, which was a sure sign that some\nnew idea had struck him.\n\n\"Well, bang me!\" he ejaculated, \"if I ain't floored again. Ain't God\ninfinite, an' if that be the case He must be infinite 'all round.' An'\nthat bein' so, then His power's infinite, and His marcy's infinite, an'\nHis love's infinite, an' He's all infinite. No limit to nothin'. An' if\nthat be so, it don't square nohow with His love an' marcy stoppin' just\nat the point where the elect leaves off an' the reprobate begins.\"\n\nAnd Joe took a long iron rod and stirred up the fire until it roared\nagain, muttering to himself the while. \"Well, if I ain't completely\nbanged. I'll ax little Nell. I b'lieve she knows more about it now than\nI do, by a long chalk.\"\n\nBy this time slates and chimneypots began to drop around him in a\ndecidedly dangerous fashion, and he had again to seek the shelter of his\nhut. But even there he did not feel quite safe, for the little wooden\nhouse rocked and creaked in the might of the storm, and threatened to\ntopple over altogether.\n\nThere was no longer any chance of meditation, so he had to content\nhimself listening to the roar of the storm. Sometimes he heard its voice\nmoaning away in the distant streets, and he wondered where it had gone\nto. Then he heard it coming up behind his hut again, at first quietly,\nas if meditating what to do; then it would gather strength and speed,\nand he would listen as it came nearer and nearer, till it would rush\nshrieking past his hut, making it creak and shiver, and once more there\nwould be a momentary lull.\n\nAnd so Joe waited and listened through the wild solemn night, and longed\nas he had rarely done for the light of the morning to appear.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTempted.\n\n  Where the watching, waiting angels\n    Lead them from the shadow dim,\n  To the brightness of His presence\n    Who has called them unto Him,--\n  Little hearts for ever stainless,\n    Little hands as pure as they,\n  Little feet by angels guided,\n    Never a forbidden way.\n\n\nTowards the close of February Nelly caught a very severe cold, which\nkept her indoors for several days. One night her cough had been so bad\nthat she had scarcely slept at all, and when she got up in the morning,\nwith flushed cheeks and hollow eyes, unrested and unrefreshed, granny\ninsisted that she was not fit to go out, and that she must stay indoors\nand keep herself warm.\n\nBenny was very sorry to lose her earnings, for, alas! it had been a hard\nstruggle for the children to find the necessary coppers day by day to\npurchase food and pay for their lodgings; and had it not been for Joe\nWrag's kindness, they would often have fared much worse. Nelly knew this\nvery well, and hence it was a great trial to her to stay indoors doing\nnothing, while her Benny was out fighting the world alone.\n\n\"How will yer manage, Benny?\" she said, with an anxious look in her\neyes, the first morning that he went out alone.\n\n\"Oh, never fear, Nell, I'll 'cumulate the coppers somehow,\" was the\nresponse.\n\n\"What's 'cumulate, Benny?\" for it was the first time he had ventured to\nuse that word in her hearing.\n\n\"Well, I might a-knowed,\" he said, putting on a knowing look, \"that you\nwould not hundercumstand sich words, 'cause as how you don't seem to\ncare for larnin' like me.\"\n\n\"Well, you 'ave not told me now, Benny.\"\n\n\"Oh, it means as how I'm bound to get the coppers somehow.\"\n\n\"How _somehow_, Benny? You'll only get 'em the right way, will yer, now?\"\n\n\"Never fear, Nell; I's not goin' to steal 'em.\"\n\n\"But if you dunna get enough, Benny?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll go hungry for a day or two; 't won't be fust time I's done it.\"\n\n\"Poor Benny!\" and she placed her wasted hand on his shoulder. \"But I\n'ope it will be true, what Joe told me t'other night.\"\n\n\"What did he tell yer?\"\n\n\"Well, he said the good Lord was sure to provide; that is, you know,\nBenny, He willna let us starve.\"\n\n\"I dunno much about _Him_, Nell.\"\n\n\"Oh, but Joe 'as told me lots an' lots about Him; an' He never says what\nHe doesna mean; an' if He says He'll provide, He will, Benny.\"\n\n\"Anyhow, I shall be glad to see it,\" was Benny's observation, as he\nwalked away, leaving Nelly standing at the door.\n\nHe found the days very long without a sight of his sister's face from\nmorn till eve. But he bore up bravely, and hurried home as early as\nhe possibly could when the day's toil was over. Nobody knew how much\n\"little Nell\" was to him: she had been the only comfort of his cheerless\nlife, and when the world seemed more rough and unfriendly than usual, it\nwas Nelly who stood by his side like a ministering angel, encouraging\nhim still to persevere.\n\nThe sight of her sweet patient face in the evening was like a\nbenediction to him, and after the frugal meal they would sit on the\nfloor with their arms around each other before granny's fire. And Benny\nwould tell his sister all the experiences of the day; making light,\nhowever, of the difficulties and disappointments, and magnifying every\nlittle pleasure that had fallen to his lot.\n\nIt was wonderful how thoughtful he was of his sister, and how he\nanticipated her every want. He would not give her a moment's pain on any\nconsideration if he could possibly help it. Yet Nelly always knew when\nhe was in trouble, though he said nothing about it; for experience had\nmade her quick to detect his every mood.\n\nOne afternoon, as Benny was passing along a narrow and not very\nfrequented street, he paused before a small hosier's shop. A great many\nthings had been hung outside the door to catch the eye of the passer-by.\nBut one article especially attracted his attention, and that was a\nwoollen \"cross-over.\"\n\n\"Golly!\" he said to himself, \"if Nelly only had that, she'd be better in\nno time.\"\n\nNelly had been much better that morning, and but for the keen east wind\nthat had been blowing for several days, she would have again ventured\ninto the streets. And as Benny looked again and again at the cross-over,\nhe thought how nice she would look with it crossed over her chest, and\nhow nice and snug and warm it would make her feel. No cold, he was sure,\ncould come through a thing like that; and it was the cold, granny said,\nthat made her cough so much.\n\nBut he knew he could not purchase it, so with a sigh he turned away. Yet\nin less than half an hour he was standing before the shop again.\n\n\"They would never miss it,\" he muttered to himself, \"an' Nelly needs it\nso much.\"\n\nThen a voice within him whispered, \"Don't steal, Benny,\" and again he\nwalked away. But the tempter followed and gave him no rest.\n\n\"I could cut the string as easy as that,\" he said to himself, snapping\nhis fingers. \"And it ain't for myself that I wants it, and I dunna think\nit can be so very wrong to take it for little Nell, when she's so ill.\"\n\nWhile he was musing thus, he was startled by a voice near him,\n\n\"Hullo, Ben, are 'e goin' to a funeral, yer look so glum?\"\n\nLooking up a narrow entry, he saw a lad that went by the name of\n\"Perks,\" engaged in trying on a pair of shoes, that were evidently new,\nthough they had been well plastered with mud.\n\nPerks was not so big as Benny, though he was two or three years older.\nHe was a strange-looking lad. A great shock of fiery red hair made hat\nor cap totally unnecessary. His face was plain, looked at under any\ncircumstances, but a look of low cunning made it at times appear almost\nrepulsive.\n\nPerks was no friend of Benny's, who rarely took the trouble to reply\nwhen addressed by him. Benny knew that he was not honest. He never sold\nmatches, and rarely carried parcels, and yet he had generally plenty\nof coppers at his disposal, and wore better clothes than any of the\nstreet lads. But to-day Benny was in a different humour to what he was\ngenerally. He had permitted an evil spirit to take possession of him,\nand so was not so particular about his company.\n\nSo he walked up the entry close to where Perks sat, and pointing to the\nshoes, said in a whisper,\n\n\"Where'd yer get them?\"\n\n\"Walked 'em,\" was the response.\n\n\"That is, stole 'em, ain't it?\"\n\n\"Gem'men of our per-fession don't say stole, it ain't perlite,\" said\nPerks, trying to look important.\n\n\"It means that, though,\" said Benny.\n\n\"Well, I admit I took 'em without leave, as I takes most things; it's\nmost conwenient.\"\n\n\"How did yer manage?\" said Benny.\n\n\"So yer wants to take up the per-fession, does yer?\" And there was a\ncunning leer in his eye as he spoke.\n\n\"No, I don't,\" said Benny, colouring up.\n\n\"What yer ax me for 'ow I did it, then?\"\n\n\"For fun.\"\n\n\"No doubt. But, I'll tell yer, nothin' is easier. Folks hang things\noutside on purpose to be stole. I took up the per-fession 'cause I\ncouldn't 'elp it. Shop-keepers put things right under my nose, an' made\nme take 'em against my will at fust. Now I's no feelin' 'bout it at all.\"\n\n\"'T ain't right, though, nohow,\" said Benny.\n\nPerks was about to sneer at this remark, but thought better of it, and\nanswered, after a pause,\n\n\"Well, if it ain't, I's not to blame. Folks just put things in my way;\nan' a chap's not to blame for eatin' butter when it's put in his mouth.\"\n\nTo this Benny ventured no remark. And Perks having fastened on the shoes\nto his satisfaction, said, \"Come with me a minute,\" and together they\nwalked off into a more crowded thoroughfare.\n\nPoor Benny! in such a state of mind as he was, he could not have fallen\ninto worse hands. He was fast getting into the toils of the tempter; and\nwho should deliver him?\n\nFor awhile Benny and Perks walked on in silence, when suddenly Perks\nclutched his arm and whispered in his ear,\n\n\"Look alive, an' I'll show yer a bit of nice play.\"\n\n\"What yer mean?\" said Benny.\n\n\"Yer see that man afore us, with a bit o' his hankecher peepin' out o'\nhis pocket?\"\n\n\"Ay.\"\n\n\"Well, there's another chap walking alongside o' him, an' comin' down\nthe street is three or four more; don't 'e see as how they'll all meet\nby that lamp-post? Well, ther'll be a bit o' crush, an' I'll just pop\nin atween 'em at the same time onexpected, an' for a moment we'll be\nsixes an' sevens, an' then the thing is done.\"\n\nAnd off Perks darted like the wind. Benny did not wait to see how he\nsucceeded in his undertaking. The poisonous seed had taken root in the\nsoil that had been prepared for its reception, and Benny hurried away\nto the hosier's shop, alas! already a thief in heart, if not in action,\nfor he had made up his mind to take the cross-over if anything like a\nfavourable opportunity presented itself.\n\n\"I's not to blame for takin' things,\" he said, using Perks's words, \"if\npeople puts 'em right in one's way.\"\n\nIt was getting dusk, and in this narrow street it was darker than in the\nstreet he had just left.\n\nYes, there was the cross-over. And, after looking at all the windows\nin the neighbourhood, to see that no one was watching him, he glided\nstealthily up to the door. The shopkeeper was busy inside. \"So much the\nbetter,\" he thought. \"Now's the time,\" and he stretched out his hand to\ngrasp the coveted article, when a hand was laid upon his arm with a firm\ngrip, and, turning, he saw a face that made the perspiration ooze from\nhim at every pore.\n\nLeaving Benny for a moment to recover his fright, we will go back to\nTempest Court, and have a look at Nelly. She had been restless and ill\nat ease all the day--a sign, granny said, that she was getting better;\nand, indeed, she felt much better in body, though she was uneasy in\nmind, and, as the day kept fine and got much warmer as the hours wore\non, she determined she would go out and see how Benny was getting on,\nfor she had a vague presentiment that all was not right.\n\nOn reaching the landing-stage she looked anxiously around, but Benny\nwas nowhere visible. This did not trouble her much, but after loitering\naround for a good part of an hour, and he did not come, she began to\nfeel alarmed; still she waited around, till, unable longer to bear the\nburden of suspense, she started off to search for him. Up one street\nand down another she went, looking here and there and everywhere, but\nwithout avail.\n\nJust before four o'clock she made her way to the old trysting-place by\nSt. George's Church, in the hope that Benny might do the same; but,\nalas! she was doomed to disappointment, for he did not come; and when\nshe saw the daylight begin to fade, she got frightened, feeling sure\nthat some evil had befallen \"her Benny.\"\n\nEvil, alas! had befallen him, though not of the nature that she had\nfeared.\n\nAt length she saw some one turn up a narrow street that looked like\nBenny. She could not be certain, but she would follow and see; so with\nbeating heart she hurried up the street.\n\nYes, it was Benny; she was near enough to recognize him now. But when\nshe saw--as she did at a glance--what he was about to do, her heart\nstood still for a moment; the next moment she hurried forward with the\nfleetness of the wind, and laid her hand upon his arm, unable to speak a\nword.\n\nFor two or three seconds the children looked at each other in silence,\nthen Nelly took her brother by the hand and led him away. She uttered no\nword of reproach, she only said, \"My poor Benny!\" and her great round\neyes filled with tears, which rolled silently down her wasted cheeks.\n\n\"It was for you, Nelly. I thought 't would warm yer. I wouldna 'ave done\nit for myself.\"\n\nAnd again came the words, in a choking voice, \"My poor Benny!\"\n\n\"I didna think it wur so very wicked, seein' as you is so ill, Nelly. Is\nyou very mad at me, Nell?\"\n\n\"I's not mad, Benny, but I's sorry--oh, so sorry! I did not think----\"\n\nBut here she broke off abruptly: she would utter no word of reproach,\nfor she knew it was all out of love for her.\n\nThat evening she could eat no supper. Benny knew the reason and did not\npress her, but her silent grief nearly broke his heart. He would rather\nsuffer anything himself than see his sister suffer. And yet now he had\ngiven her keener pain than words could tell.\n\nIn the middle of the night he awoke and found her sobbing by his side as\nthough her little heart would break, and he knew that he was the cause\nof her grief.\n\n\"Don't take on so, Nell,\" he said, in a voice that had the sound of\ntears in it. And he drew her tear-stained face towards him and kissed\nher affectionately.\n\nBut she only sobbed the more.\n\n\"Do forgive me, Nell,\" he said. \"I's very sorry.\"\n\n\"I 'as nothin' to forgive you for, Benny; you's always been good to me.\nAx the dear Lord to forgive yer.\"\n\n\"I knows nowt about Him, Nell.\"\n\n\"But He knows about you, Benny--Joe says so; and He sees everything we\ndoes. Ax Him.\"\n\n\"Could He hear if I wur to ax Him?\"\n\n\"Yes, Joe says as He hears everything.\"\n\n\"Then I'll try Him,\" said Benny, and, sitting up in bed, he commenced,--\n\n\"If you plaise, Mr. God, I's very sorry I tried to stole; but if you'll\nbe a trump an' not split on a poor little chap, I'll be mighty 'bliged\nto yer. An' I promise 'e I won't do nowt o' the sort agin'.\"\n\n\"There, will that do, Nell?\"\n\n\"Say Amen.\"\n\n\"Amen,\" said Benny, and he lay down to listen for the answer.\n\nBut after waiting a long time and no voice broke the stillness of the\nnight, and Nelly having fallen asleep, our hero concluded that _she_ had\nreceived the answer, as she seemed so much comforted; so he thought that\nhe might go to sleep also, which he accordingly did, and did not awake\ntill late in the morning, when he saw his sister bending over him with a\ncalm face, from which all trace of pain had fled, and a beautiful light\nshining in her eyes.\n\nThis satisfied him that his prayer had been answered, and once more his\nheart was at peace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nIn the Woods.\n\n    I roam the woods that crown\n  The upland, where the mingled splendours glow,\n  Where the gay company of trees look down\n    On the green fields below.\n\n    Let in through all the trees\n  Come the strange rays; the forest depths are bright,\n  Their sunny-coloured foliage in the breeze\n    Twinkles like beams of light.\n                           --Bryant.\n\n\nPerks was very much annoyed that Benny had not stayed to see him perform\nthe feat of picking a gentleman's pocket, nevertheless, he was very\nanxious to cultivate our hero's acquaintance, especially as Benny had\ngenerally treated him with unmistakable contempt; so on the following\nmorning he sought out Benny, and tried his very best to make himself\nagreeable. But Benny was in a decidedly unfriendly mood, and threw cold\nwater on all Perks' advances. But, nothing daunted, Perks kept near him\nmost of the day, and even offered to treat him to what he called \"a\nfeed.\" But it was of no use. Benny had learned a lesson he would not\neasily forget, and he knew that his safety lay in having as little to do\nwith Perks and his class as possible. So as evening came on and Perks\nstill hung around him, he lost all patience, and, doubling his fist in\nan unmistakable manner, he said, with a gymnastic flourish,\n\n\"Look 'ere, Perks, if yer don't walk yer pegs in double-quick time,\nyou'll wish yer had, that's all.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's yer game, is it?\" said Perks, in a defiant tone, and\nsquaring up in front of Benny.\n\n\"It are,\" was the reply; \"an' if yer don't want to see fire, you'd\nbetter be off like greased lightnin'.\"\n\n\"I shall go when I likes, and not afore,\" said Perks; \"an' if yer thinks\nyer's goin' to bully this little chap, you's got the wrong pig by the\near.\"\n\n\"I wants to bully nobody,\" said Benny, in a milder tone; \"but I won't\nhave yer a hangin' about me all day.\"\n\n\"I 'spose yer wants to crib somethin' without my knowin' it,\" said\nPerks, with a sneer.\n\n\"It's a lie,\" said Benny, colouring painfully, as the event of the\nprevious day crossed his mind.\n\n\"'T ain't a lie, neither,\" was the response, \"or you'd not get so red\nover it.\"\n\n\"D' yer think I's a thief, then?\" said Benny.\n\n\"No,\" said Perks scornfully, \"but I knows it.\"\n\n\"An' yer shall know some'at else afore yer a minit older,\" said Benny,\nspringing upon him, and dealing him a blow between the eyes that made\nhim stagger; and, before he could recover himself, a second blow sent\nhim reeling against a wall.\n\nFor a moment Perks glared at his antagonist with flaming eyes, but he\nsaw that he was no match for Benny, so he turned on his heel and walked\naway. He had not gone many steps, however, before he came back again.\n\n\"Look 'ere, Ben Bates,\" he said, \"you's licked me now, but I'll get my\nrevenge, an' I'll a'most plague the life out o' yer,\" and once more he\nwalked away.\n\nPerks kept his word; from that day he became the greatest plague of\nBenny's life. He stole his matches, picked his pocket, tripped him up in\nthe street, and annoyed him in every possible way that he could imagine,\nalways mindful, however, to keep out of the reach of Benny's arm; and,\nbeing fleet-footed, that was not difficult.\n\nBenny, however, said that he could \"'ford to bide his time,\" so he\nquietly went on his way, feeling that nothing could trouble him very\nmuch now that \"little Nell\" was getting better again.\n\nAnd as the summer advanced she did seem to get very much better. The\ncough became less troublesome, her appetite improved, her cheerfulness\ncame back, and altogether she seemed to be taking, as Joe Wrag put it,\n\"a new lease of her life.\"\n\nAnd yet a close observer would have noticed that the improvement was\nmore in appearance than in reality. The pink spot still burned on either\ncheek, and her great round eyes shone with an unnatural lustre, and her\nstrength, which had been failing for months, did not seem to come back;\nand though she went out with Benny in the morning and came back with him\nin the evening, yet each evening she seemed more tired and worn than on\nthe previous one. She made no complaint, however; but, on the contrary,\nalways declared that she was getting ever so much better.\n\nFor several weeks Joe Wrag had been planning to give the children a\ntreat; and one fine morning in June he put in an appearance at Tempest\nCourt before they had left, much to their surprise and delight.\n\nNelly was the first to see him coming up the court, and ran to meet\nhim, her eyes beaming with pleasure. \"Oh, Joe,\" she exclaimed, \"I's so\npleased to see you!\"\n\n\"Is you, my purty?\" said Joe fondly; and, stooping down, he took her up\nin his arms, and carried her into the house.\n\nGranny looked up in surprise, and Benny stared in bewilderment, fearing\nthere was mischief in the wind.\n\n\"Yer don't get much heavier,\" said Joe, sitting down with Nelly on his\nknee. \"We'll have to feed yer up a bit somehow.\"\n\n\"Oh, I's very well, Joe,\" said Nelly, nestling closer to her old friend.\n\n\"Dunno 'bout that,\" said Joe reflectively; \"but what d' yer say 'bout\nhavin' holiday to-day?\"\n\n\"Oh, Methusaler!\" said Benny, brightening up in a moment, \"that's the\ngame, are it?\" and he went out in the doorway and stood on his head--a\nsure sign that he was more than usually delighted.\n\nNelly looked up in Joe's face with a beautiful light in her eyes. \"D'\nyer mean it, Joe?\" she said, simply.\n\n\"Ay, my bonny, that I do,\" responded Joe.\n\n\"Oh, then, won't it be jist--jist--\"\n\n\"Profusely,\" said Benny, coming to her rescue with one of his grand\nwords, of which he had been laying in a stock of late.\n\n\"Now, then,\" said Joe, \"get on yer best togs, and let's be off.\"\n\nPoor children! they had not much of best or worst in the way of attire,\nbut, such as it was, it was clean and neatly mended. Granny did her\nvery best to turn them out respectable, and certainly they did her no\ndiscredit.\n\n\"Where is we going?\" said Nelly, as she stepped along by Joe's side, her\neyes sparkling with delight.\n\n\"Into the woods somewhere on t' other side o' the water,\" said Joe,\nlooking fondly down into the child's beaming eyes.\n\nBenny had nearly stood on his head again when he heard that; but thought\nbetter of it, and contented himself with a shrill whistle expressive of\ndelight.\n\n\"Better an' better,\" he thought, flinging his cap into the air and\ncatching it on his toe; \"won't I enjoy myself, just, that's all?\"\n\nBy ten o'clock they were on the landing-stage, and soon after they were\ngliding up the river towards Eastham. Oh, how the wavelets sparkled in\nthe summer's sunshine, and how the paddle-wheels tossed the water into\nfoam! How happy everything seemed to-day! The ferries were crowded with\npassengers, all of whom seemed in the best of spirits; and the rush of\nwater and the beat of the engine seemed to Nelly the happiest sounds she\nhad ever heard.\n\nBenny was rushing here and there and everywhere, and asking Joe\nquestions about everything. But Nelly sat still. Her thoughts were too\nbig for utterance, and her little heart was full to overflowing.\n\nAt length they reach New Ferry, where several passengers get off and\nseveral others get on; then on they glide again. The river here seems\nlike a sheet of glass, so broad and smooth. Now they are nearing the\nriver's bank, and Nelly is delighted to watch the trees gliding past.\nHow wonderful everything seems! Surely her dreams are becoming a reality\nat last.\n\nFor awhile after they land they sit on the river's bank in the shade of\nthe trees, and Nelly rubs her eyes and pinches herself, to be certain\nthat she is not asleep. How grandly the mile-wide river at their feet\nflows downward to the sea! And what a beautiful background to the\npicture the wooded landscape makes that stretches away beyond Garston\nand Aigburth! And Nelly wonders to herself if it is possible that heaven\ncan be more beautiful than this.\n\nBut Benny soon gets impatient to be off into the wood, and, humouring\nhis wish, they set off up the narrow path, between banks of ferns and\nprimroses and wild flowers of almost every hue. The tall trees wave\ntheir branches above them, and the birds whistle out their happy hearts.\nHere and there the grasshoppers chirp among the undergrowth, and myriads\nof insects make the air vocal with their ceaseless hum.\n\nThey had scarcely got into the heart of the wood ere they found that\nBenny was missing; but they were neither surprised nor alarmed at this,\nfor the lad was fairly brimming over with delight, and could not stay\nfor five minutes in the same place if he were to be crowned.\n\nNelly was as much delighted as her brother; perhaps more so, but she\nhad a different way of expressing it. She felt as she sat on a mossy\nbank, holding Joe's rough and horny hand within both her own, and looked\naway up the long avenues between the trees, and watched the dancing\nsunlight that was sifted down in golden patches, and listened to the\ndreamy murmur of the summer's wind through the leafy trees, mingling\nwith the song of birds and the lowing of the cattle in the distant\nfields, as if she could have cried for very joy. It was all so solemn,\nand yet so delightful, so awe-inspiring and yet so gladsome, that\nshe hardly knew whether to laugh outright, or hide her face on Joe's\nshoulder and have a good cry.\n\nBenny, however, decided the matter for her. He had been wandering no one\nknew whither, and Joe was beginning to think that it was time to go off\nin search of him, when they heard him shouting at the top of his voice,--\n\n\"Joe, Joe! Golly! Make haste--quick, d' ye hear? Thunder!\"\n\nJudging by the tone of his voice, as well as by his words, that he was\nin a difficulty of some kind, Joe and Nelly started off in the direction\nfrom whence the sound came. They had not gone far, however, before they\nespied our hero, and at sight of him Joe stood stock-still and held\nhis sides. For there was Benny suspended by his nether garment to the\nbranch of a tree, and striking out with his hands and feet like a huge\noctopus in a frantic and vain endeavour to recover a horizontal position.\n\nHe had gone out on this branch, which was not more than six feet from\nthe ground, for some unknown purpose, and, missing his hold, he slipped,\nand would have fallen to the ground but for the friendly stump that held\nhim suspended in mid-air.\n\n\"Joe! Oh, do come! Murder and turf! D' ye hear? What's yer larfin at?\nAre 'e moon-struck? Oh--h--!\" he shrieked out at the top of his voice,\nstill going through most unheard-of gymnastic exercises, and vainly\ntrying to raise his head to the level of his heels.\n\nTo make the matter worse, a young gentleman passing at the time inquired\nof Benny, with a very grave face, \"Whether his was a new method of\nlearning to swim on dry land? If so, he thought he had got the action\nnearly perfect, the only thing required was to keep his head just a\ntrifle higher.\"\n\nBy this time, however, Joe had come to his relief, and easily lifted him\ndown without further mishap.\n\nThe young gentleman tried to poke some more fun at Benny, but he would\nnot reply, and soon after set off with Joe and Nelly to get some dinner.\nAfter dinner they took a ramble across the fields, in the direction\nof Raby Mere. Benny's adventure had rather sobered him, so he did not\nobject to assist his sister in gathering wild flowers, while Joe\nartistically arranged them into what seemed to the children to be a\nmagnificent bouquet.\n\nFleet-footed indeed were the hours of that long summer's afternoon.\nBenny wished a thousand times that the day could last for ever; and\nNelly, though she was getting tired, watched with a look of pain in her\neyes the sun getting farther and farther down in the western sky.\n\nAs they were returning across the fields Benny was strongly tempted to\nleap a ditch that he had noticed at the beginning of their ramble--so\nstrongly tempted indeed that he could not resist it. So off he set at\na swinging trot as soon as they got into the field. Joe guessed what\nhe was after, and called him back; but it was of no use, he either did\nnot hear or would not heed, for he went faster and faster as he neared\nthe ditch. Joe saw him fling up his hands, take a flying leap, and then\ndisappear. After waiting a few moments, and he did not appear on the\nopposite bank, Joe and Nelly hurried after him. On reaching the ditch\nthey found that he was stuck fast in the mud about two feet from the\nopposite side, and the more he tried to get out the deeper he sank.\n\n\"Oh, quick, Joe!\" he shouted, \"or I'll be out o' sight in another minit.\"\n\n\"Sarve you right!\" said Joe, laughing; \"you had no business to get in\nthere.\"\n\n\"I can't stay to argify,\" retorted Benny; \"don't yer see there's scarce\nanything of me left?\"\n\n\"Ay, I see plain enough,\" said Joe, going to the other side, and pulling\nhim out, though not without an effort. \"I wonder what mischief you'll be\ninto next?\"\n\n\"Dunno,\" said Benny, regarding his legs with a look of dismay. Then,\nafter a long pause, \"I say, Joe, how's I to get this mud off?\"\n\n\"Scrape off what yer can,\" said Joe, \"and let the rest dry, and it'll\nrub off as clean as a new pin.\"\n\nBenny was rather ashamed of his appearance, however, when he got into\nthe wood again, and found himself in the midst of two or three hundred\nSunday-school children and their teachers, all nicely dressed, who had\ncome out for a picnic. But when he saw them each with a small bun loaf\nand a cup of milk, he could not help drawing near, notwithstanding the\nrather disgraceful state of his legs. Nelly was also anxious to have a\nnearer view of all those happy-looking children.\n\nFortunately for Benny, the superintendent of the school was the\ngentleman that had invited him into the chapel months before. Benny felt\nsure he knew them again, but whether he did or not he invited all three\nto sit down with the rest, and gave them each a bun and a cup of milk.\n\nJoe was as delighted as the children with the kindness shown, and was\nsoon quite at his ease.\n\nAfter lunch the children ran races for prizes, and Benny was invited to\ncompete with the rest. This suited him exactly, and very soon after,\nwith about a dozen others, he was bounding up a broad avenue between the\ntrees, in a well-matched and most exciting race.\n\nFor the first half of the distance Benny dropped into the rear, then he\nbegan gradually to gain upon the others. Now was his time, so putting on\na spurt, for which he had saved his breath, he went bounding ahead of\nall the others, and amid loud hurrahs came first into the goal.\n\nBenny never felt so proud in his life before as when that first prize--a\nbrand new sixpence--was put into his hand. His success, however,\ndisqualified him from competing again, so he had to content himself with\nwatching the others run.\n\nBut the most delightful circumstance of all to Nelly was when all the\nchildren stood up in a large circle, and sang in their pure young voices\nthe following hymn:--\n\n \"Land ahead! Its fruits are waving\n    O'er the fields of fadeless green;\n  And the living waters laving\n    Shores where heavenly forms are seen.\n\n \"There let go the anchor. Riding\n    On this calm and silvery bay,\n  Seaward fast the tide is gliding,\n    Shores in sunlight stretch away.\n\n \"Now we're safe from all temptation,\n    All the storms of life are past;\n  Praise the Rock of our salvation,\n    We are safely home at last.\"\n\nNelly never forgot that little hymn to her dying day; and when that\nevening they glided down the placid river towards home, she repeated to\nherself over and over again--\n\n \"Seaward fast the tide is gliding,\n    Shores in sunlight stretch away.\"\n\nAnd when in her little corner she lay down to sleep, it was only to\ndream of the sunlit shores on the banks of the far Jordan river.\n\nHeaven seemed nearer and dearer to her ever after that day, and she\nsometimes almost longed for the sunny slopes of that far-off country\nwhere there should be no more weariness nor pain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nBenny prays.\n\n  Prayer is the burden of a sigh,\n    The falling of a tear,\n  The upward glancing of the eye\n    When none but God is near.\n\n  Prayer is the simplest form of speech\n    That infant lips can try;\n  Prayer the sublimest strains that reach\n    The Majesty on high.\n                  --Montgomery.\n\n\nThe long summer days passed all too quickly, and autumn came again.\nThe days began to shorten, and the evenings to be cold. Nelly felt the\nchange in an unmistakable manner, for her cough returned worse than\never, and her appetite and strength began to fail rapidly. But the\nhopeful little child battled bravely with her growing weakness, and\neach morning went forth to earn her daily bread.\n\nOne afternoon in October Benny was down on the pier, when he saw Perks\ncoming towards him, and not wishing to have anything to say to him, he\nwas about to turn away, when Perks called out,\n\n\"Does yer want to hear a bit o' news?\"\n\n\"No!\" said Benny.\n\n\"Yer wants to 'ear what I knows, I'm sartin.\"\n\n\"Well! what is it?\" said Benny, carelessly.\n\n\"Your Nelly's killed!\"\n\n\"It's a lie!\" said Benny, paling to the lips.\n\n\"'Taint a lie, neither; she's been run over with a 'bus, an' 'ad her yed\ncut off.\"\n\n\"You lying thief!\" said Benny. \"If yer not out o' my sight in a minit\nI'll pound yer to a jelly.\"\n\nAnd Benny made a rush towards him. But Perks was not to be caught, and\nwas soon out of sight.\n\nBenny did not believe a word Perks had said; and yet, somehow, his words\ntroubled him, and very long seemed the time till four o'clock, when he\nwould meet her in the shadow of St. George's Church.\n\nIf Perks' only object was to plague and annoy Benny, he could not have\nbeen more successful, for try as he would, he could not get Perks'\nwords out of his head. Punctually at four o'clock he was standing\nby the church, but Nelly was not there, and a dull pain crept into\nhis heart, such as he had never felt before. Five minutes pass--ten\nminutes--fifteen minutes pass, and still Nelly had not come, and Benny\nbegan to fear that something had really happened to her.\n\nJust then he saw Bill Tucker--a boy of his acquaintance--coming towards\nhim.\n\n\"Have yer seen Nelly, Bill?\" he shouted, when the lad got within hearing\ndistance.\n\n\"Ay; ain't yer heerd?\"\n\n\"Heerd what?\" said Benny, growing paler than ever.\n\n\"Why, she's got hurt,\" said the other.\n\n\"Are 'e sure, now?\" said Benny, great tears starting in his eyes.\n\n\"Ay, quite sure. I seed the perlice myself takin' her to the 'firmary.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! 't aint true, are it, Bill? Say yer a-foolin' me,\" said Benny,\ntrembling from head to foot.\n\n\"I wish it weren't true,\" said, the lad, \"but I seed 'em pick her up\nmysel', an' I's 'feared she's dead; she looked like it.\"\n\n\"Did a 'bus run over her?\"\n\n\"No. A big dog runned agin her, an' she fell with her yed on a sharp\nstone.\"\n\n\"Yer quite sure, Bill?\"\n\n\"Ay, quite,\" said the lad; \"but go to the 'firmary an' see for yoursel'.\"\n\n\"Which way?\" said Benny.\n\n\"Haaf-way up Brownlow Hill, an' roun' to the left; a mighty big 'ouse.\"\n\nAnd off Benny started, like the wind. By dint of many inquiries he found\nhimself in the right street, but looking in vain for the Infirmary.\n\nJust then a policeman came up.\n\n\"Could yer tell me where the 'firmary are, please?\" said Benny, doffing\nhis cap.\n\n\"Why, there, right afore your eyes.\"\n\n\"What, that?\" said Benny, pointing to the huge building.\n\n\"Ay, to be sure,\" said the policeman.\n\n\"Oh, lor'!\" was the reply, \"I thought that wur the 'ouse the Queen lived\nin.\"\n\nThe policeman was about to laugh, but noticing Benny's troubled face, he\nsaid,\n\n\"Do you want to get in?\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said Benny, \"that I do.\"\n\n\"Then go up this street. There's the lodge door on your left; you can't\nmiss it.\"\n\n\"Thanks, sir,\" and off Benny started. In response to his timid knock the\ndoor was opened by a kind-looking man.\n\n\"This are the 'firmary, ain't it?\" said Benny.\n\n\"Yes, my little man,\" was the answer. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"I wants to know if Nelly are in 'ere?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Who is she?\"\n\n\"My sister,\" said Benny, the tears starting in his eyes.\n\n\"When was she brought here?\"\n\n\"To-day. Bill Tucker said as 'ow she was hurt in the street an' brought\nhere.\"\n\n\"Yes, a little girl was brought in two or three hours ago.\"\n\n\"Wur she very white, an' had long hair?\"\n\n\"Yes, my little man.\"\n\n\"Oh, that wur Nelly. Let me see her, please.\"\n\n\"You cannot to-day, it's against rules; you can see her to-morrow\nmorning, after ten o'clock.\"\n\n\"Oh, do let me jist peep at her.\"\n\n\"I cannot, my little fellow; and besides, it would do her no good.\"\n\n\"But it ud do me good,\" said Benny, gulping down a great lump in his\nthroat. \"She is all I has in the world.\"\n\n\"I'm very sorry, my boy, but you can't see her to-night.\"\n\n\"Not for jist a minit?\"\n\n\"No, not to-night.\"\n\n\"She ain't dead, then?\"\n\n\"No, but she is unconscious.\"\n\n\"Will she get better?\"\n\n\"I hope so. Now run away and come again to-morrow, and rest satisfied\nthat your little sister will be well taken care of.\"\n\n\"Oh, please,\" said Benny, making a last appeal, the great tears running\ndown his cheeks the while.\n\n\"I cannot let you see her, however willing I might be,\" said the man.\n\"Now run away, there's a good lad.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear,\" groaned Benny, as he stepped out into the darkening street.\n\"What shall I do? what shall I do?\"\n\nHe had tasted no food since noon, but he never thought of hunger. He had\nbeen on the tramp all the day, but he felt no weariness. There was one\ngreat pain in his heart, and that banished every other feeling. Nelly\nwas in that great house suffering, perhaps dying; and he could not speak\nto her--not even look at her. What right had these people to keep his\nNelly from him? Was not she his own little Nell, all that he had in the\nwide, wide world? How dared they, then, to turn him away?\n\nHour after hour he wandered up and down in front of the huge building,\nwatching the twinkling lights in its many windows. How could he go away\nwhile Nelly was suffering there? Could he sleep in his snug corner while\nhis own little Nell was suffering amongst strangers? It could not be.\n\nSo when the great town grew silent around him, he sat down on a doorstep\nnearly opposite the entrance, and waited for the morning.\n\nThe night was chilly, but he felt not the cold; his heart felt as if it\nwould burn through his body. How long the night seemed, and he almost\nwondered if morning would ever come.\n\nSuddenly a thought struck him. Had he not better pray? He remembered\nhow Nelly prayed every night ere she lay down to sleep, and once he had\nprayed and felt all the better for it. He would pray again.\n\nSo he got up and knelt on the cold flags, and looking up into the silent\nheavens, where the pale stars kept watch over the sleeping earth,\nhe said, \"Oh, Mr. God, I's in great trouble, for Nelly's got hurt,\nand they's took her into the 'firmary, an' won't let me see her till\nto-morrer, but You knows all about it, I specks, for Joe says as how You\nknows everything. But I dunna want her to die, for Joe says You takes\npeople who dies that is good to a mighty nice place; nicer'n Eastham by\na long chalk, an' how You has lots an' lots o' childer; an' if that be\nthe case, I's sure You needn't take little Nell; for oh, Sir, she's all\nI's got in the world. Please let her stay an' get better. Oh, do now!\nfor I'll break my heart if she dies. An' 'member, I's only a little\nchap, an' I's no one but Nelly; an' 'tis so lonesome out here, an' she\nin there. Please make her better. If I was in Your place, an' You was a\nlittle chap like me, I'd let Your Nelly stay. I would for sure. An' oh,\nif You'll let my Nelly stay an' get better, I'll be awful good. Amen.\"\n\nBenny waited for a few moments longer in silence, then got up and crept\nto the doorstep, and in five minutes after he was fast asleep.\n\nHe was aroused in the morning about nine o'clock by the door being\nopened suddenly, against which he was leaning, and he fell into the\npassage. He got up as quickly as possible, but not in time to escape a\nfierce kick dealt him by a hard-featured woman.\n\nPoor child! it was a painful awaking for him. But he was thankful it was\nbroad day. He was cold, and almost faint for want of food, yet he was\nnot conscious of hunger.\n\nWhen at length he was admitted into the Infirmary he walked as one in a\ndream. At any other time he would have noticed the long corridors and\nbroad flights of stairs. But he saw nothing of this to-day. He kept his\neyes fixed on the nurse who walked before him, and who was leading him\nto his little Nell.\n\nHe was told that he must be very quiet, and on no account excite her, or\nit might prove fatal to her, as she was in a very critical state. She\nhad recovered consciousness on the previous night, but she was so weak,\nand her nervous system had received such a shock, that she could not\nbear any excitement.\n\nBenny only partly understood what it all meant, but he had determined\nthat he would be very quiet, and make no more noise than he could\npossibly help. So he followed the pleasant-faced nurse as silently as\npossible into the Children's Ward. He noticed the two long rows of beds\nbetween which they were passing, but he had no eyes for the occupants.\n\nAt length the nurse stopped by the side of a little cot, and with a\nsudden bound he stood by her side. He could hardly repress a cry that\nrose to his lips, and a great lump rose in his throat that almost choked\nhim; but with a tremendous effort he gulped it down, and brushed away\nthe tears that almost blinded him.\n\nThere in the cot was his little Nell, pale as the pillow on which she\nlay, yet with a look of deep content upon her face, and just the shadow\nof a smile lingering round the corners of her mouth.\n\nBenny was about to throw his arms around her, but the nurse held up her\nfinger. Nelly's eyes were closed, so that she did not know of their\npresence, and Benny was made to understand that he must wait until she\nshould open her eyes of her own accord.\n\nSo he stood as motionless as the little figure on the bed, gazing with\nhungry eyes at his little sister, who was silently slipping away from\nhis grasp. He had not to wait long. Slowly the great round eyes opened,\nthe vanishing smile came back and brightened all her face, the lips\nparted sufficiently for her to whisper \"My Benny.\" And with a low cry\nBenny bent down his head, and the little wasted arms were twined about\nhis neck, and then the round eyes closed again, and the nurse saw two\ntears steal out underneath the long lashes, and roll silently down her\ncheek.\n\nFor a few moments they remained thus in silence, then Benny, unable\nlonger to restrain his feelings, sobbed out--\n\n\"Oh, Nelly! I can't bear it; my heart's breaking.\"\n\n\"Don't give way so,\" she said softly. \"It's so comfortable here, an' the\ngood Lord'll take care o' you, Benny.\"\n\n\"But you will soon be better, Nelly, won't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, Benny, I'll soon be better, but not as you mean it. I's going to\nJesus, and shall never have no more cough, nor feel no more pain.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! you's going to get better. I axed the Lord last night to make\nyou better an' let you stay.\"\n\n\"No, Benny, I shan't stay long. I's known it for months, an' I's willin'\nto go, 'cause I know as how the Lord will take care of you.\"\n\n\"But I canna let you go,\" said Benny, sobbing louder than ever.\n\nThen the nurse came forward, and laid her hand upon his shoulder. \"You\nmust not excite your sister,\" she said kindly, \"for that is not the way\nto make her better.\"\n\n\"Oh, but she's all I has,\" he sobbed.\n\n\"Yes, poor boy, I know,\" she replied. \"But if your sister leaves you\nshe'll be better off, and will not have to tramp the streets in the cold\nand wet; so you must think that what is your loss will be her gain.\"\n\nNelly raised her eyes to the nurse with a grateful look for talking to\nBenny in that way. And before he left he had grown calm, and seemingly\nresigned. It was a painful parting; but Nelly did her best to cheer him\nup, reminding him that in two days he would be able to come and see her\nagain.\n\nGranny was in great trouble at the absence of the children, and it was\nno small relief to her when, about noon, Benny put in an appearance\nat Tempest Court. One look at his face, however, was sufficient to\nconvince her that something had happened, and when Benny told her what\nhad befallen his little Nell, the old woman sat down and cried; for she\nknew very well that never more would the little face brighten the dingy\ncourt. And granny had got to love the sweet, patient little child as her\nown; and though for months she had been convinced that the little flower\nwas marked to fall, yet it had come in a way she had not expected, and,\nlike Benny, she felt it very hard to give her up.\n\nAfter dinner Benny went out again to face the world. It was with a very\nsad heart that he did it; for he felt that from henceforth he would have\nto fight the battle of life alone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nFading Away.\n\n  The morning flowers displayed their sweets,\n    And gay their silken leaves unfold,\n  As careless of the noontide heats,\n    As fearless of the evening cold.\n\n  Nipt by the winds unkindly blast,\n    Parched by the sun's directer ray,\n  The momentary glories waste,\n    The short-lived beauties die away.\n                           --S. Wesley.\n\n\nJoe Wrag heard the news in silence. Benny, who had gone to him to tell\nhim what had happened to Nell, was not half pleased that he said nothing\nin reply. But Joe was too troubled to talk. Like granny, he had known\nfor months what was coming, but it had come suddenly, and in a way that\nhe had not expected, and the old man, as he afterwards expressed it, was\n\"struck all of a heap.\"\n\nBenny waited for some time, but finding Joe was not inclined to talk,\nhe made his way home, leaving the old man gazing into the fire, with a\nvacant look in his eyes and a look of pain upon his face.\n\nNo one ever knew what the old man suffered that night. It was like\ntearing open the wound that had been made twenty years before, when his\nonly son, as the crowning act of his unkindness, ran away from home, and\nhad never since been heard of.\n\n\"If I could only believe that there was the smallest hope o' my ever\ngetting to heaven,\" he muttered, \"it 'ud be easier to bear.\"\n\nAnd he hid his face in his hands, while great tears dropped between his\nfingers to the floor.\n\n\"Bless her little heart!\" he murmured; \"she did not believe as how any\nwur excluded; she allers stuck to that word 'whosoever,' an' sometimes I\nwur inclined to think as how she wur right. I wonder, now, if she wur?\nfor sartinly it looks the reasonabler.\n\n\"Bless me!\" he said after a long pause, \"I'm getting mortal shaky in my\nfaith; I used to be firm as a rock. I wonder if it are my heart getting\nrighter, or my head getting wrong. But I mun have a few more talks wi'\nthe little hangel afore she goes.\"\n\nAs soon as Joe was liberated from his watch, he made his way direct to\nthe Infirmary, and bitterly was he disappointed when told that he could\nnot be admitted, and that if he wanted to see the child he must come\nagain on the following day.\n\nHis heart was yearning for a sight of her face, and another day and\nnight seemed such a long time to wait; but he turned away without a\nword, and went slowly home.\n\nEvening found him again at his post of duty, and the next morning found\nhim anxious and sad. The night had seemed so very long, and he was\nburning with impatience to get away.\n\nThe men came to work at length, and off he started with all possible\nspeed. The porter at the door knew him again, and he was admitted\nwithout a word.\n\nNelly was expecting him; she knew it was visitors' day, and she was\ncertain he would come, so she waited with closed eyes, listening for the\nfootfall of her old friend.\n\nShe knew without looking up when he stooped beside her, and reached out\nher wasted hand, and drew down his weather-beaten wrinkled face and\nkissed him.\n\nFor a long time neither of them spoke. Joe felt if he attempted to utter\na word it would choke him, for she was far more wasted than he expected\nto see her, and somehow he felt that that was the last time they would\never meet on earth.\n\nNelly was the first to break the silence.\n\n\"I's so glad you's come, Joe,\" she said simply.\n\n\"Are 'e, my honey?\" said Joe, with a choking in his throat.\n\n\"Ay,\" she replied; \"I wanted to see yer once more. You's been very good\nto me, Joe, and to Benny, an' I wanted to thank you afore I died.\"\n\n\"I dunna want thanks, honey,\" he said, sitting down in the one chair by\nher bedside, and hiding his face in his hands.\n\n\"I know yer does not want 'em, Joe; but it does me good, an' I shall\ntell the Lord when I gets to heaven how good you've been.\"\n\nJoe could not reply, and Nelly closed her eyes, and whispered again to\nherself, as she had often done,\n\n \"Seaward fast the tide is gliding,\n    Shores in sunlight stretch away.\"\n\nThen after awhile she spoke again, without opening her eyes.\n\n\"You'll not be long afore you comes too, will yer, Joe?\"\n\n\"Perhaps the Lord will let me look at you through the gate,\" sobbed Joe;\n\"but I'm afeard He won't let sich as me in.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Joe,\" she said, opening her eyes with such a pained look.\n\"Does you think the Lord does not love yer as much as I do? An' won't He\nbe as glad to see yer as I shall?\"\n\n\"It does look reasonable like, my purty,\" said Joe; \"but, oh, I'm so\nafeard.\"\n\n\"'Who-so-ever,'\" whispered Nelly, and again closed her eyes, while\nthe troubled expression passed away, and the smile that Joe loved to\nsee came back and lit up her pure _spirituelle_ face with a wonderful\nbeauty. And as Joe watched the smile lingering about her mouth as if\nloth to depart, he felt somehow as if that child had been sent of God\nto teach him the truth, and to lighten the burden of his dreary life by\ngiving him a hope of heaven.\n\n\"'Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings,'\" he muttered to himself.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the nurse, coming softly to his side, \"out of the mouths of\nbabes He perfects praise.\"\n\nJoe looked up in surprise. \"Do you think the bairn is right?\" he\nstammered out.\n\n\"I'm sure of it,\" she replied.\n\n\"But what about the elect?\" said Joe, in a tone of voice that proclaimed\nhow deeply he was agitated.\n\n\"I think the elect are 'whosoever will,'\" she replied.\n\n\"So Nelly thinks,\" he said, and shook his head sadly, as if such news\nwere too good to be true.\n\nThe nurse, besides being a kind motherly woman who dearly loved\nchildren, was also a person of strong common sense, and hence she saw\nJoe's difficulty in a moment.\n\n\"You have no children of your own, I suppose,\" she said.\n\n\"I had a son once,\" said Joe. \"I hope he's still living.\"\n\n\"You do not love him, of course?\"\n\nIn a moment Joe was on his feet.\n\n\"Love him!\" said Joe, trembling from head to foot. \"I'd lie down an' die\nfor him this blessed moment if it would do him good.\"\n\n\"Ah! he has been a very good son, I expect,\" said the nurse.\n\nJoe sat down again, and hid his face in his hands. After awhile he\nlooked up and said with evident emotion,\n\n\"No, he was what people would call a bad son--a very bad 'un.\"\n\n\"Then if he were to come home again, you certainly would close the door\nagainst him?\"\n\n\"Close the door agin him! Close the door agin my own child, my own flesh\nand blood! Why, I've been longing for years for him to come home. I\nwish he'd try me, he should have the best of everything I've got in the\nhouse. Oh, marcy! how my poor old heart 'ud ache with joy if he were to\ncome to-night.\"\n\nJoe had got quite excited while delivering himself of this long speech.\nSo the nurse said quietly,\n\n\"So you think, Joe, that you are better than God.\"\n\n\"Better 'n God?\"\n\n\"Yes; more merciful, and loving, and kind.\"\n\n\"Who said so?\" said Joe, staring at her as if he could scarcely believe\nhis own ears.\n\n\"Well, you implied it,\" said the nurse, quietly.\n\n\"Me implied it?\" said he in a tone of bewilderment. \"How so?\"\n\n\"Well, you say you have a bad son who has been away many years, and yet\nyou say you love him still, so much so that you would willingly die for\nhim; and that, bad as he has been, if he were to come home to-night,\ninstead of driving him from the door, you would give him the heartiest\nwelcome, and think nothing in the house too good for him. And yet you\nthink God will turn away you. So you must admit, Joe,\" she said with a\nsmile, \"that you think you have more love and mercy in your heart than\nGod has in His?\"\n\nJoe was silent. And Nelly whispered to the nurse, \"Thank you _so_ much.\"\n\nAfter awhile Joe got up, and leaning over the crib, he kissed the pale\nbrow of the little sufferer. \"Good bye, my purty,\" he whispered. \"We'll\nmeet again, I do believe.\"\n\n\"Ay, Joe, I'm sure we shall.\"\n\n\"I'm main sorry to lose 'e,\" he said in a faltering voice, and brushing\nhis rough hand across his eyes; \"but I ken give yer to God.\"\n\n\"I'll be waiting, Joe, 'gin you come. Now kiss me, for I'll be gone, I\nreckon, afore you come again.\"\n\nSilently Joe bent over her, and pressed a last lingering kiss upon her\npaling lips. Then, sobbing, turned away and left the room.\n\nGranny and Benny called a little later in the day, and found her sinking\nfast. Her last words to her brother were: \"Be good, Benny, an' the Lord\nwill provide, an' we'll meet in heaven.\" Then she lay as if asleep,\ntaking no further notice of any one.\n\nOnce or twice the nurse heard her repeating, \"Seaward fast the tide is\ngliding,\" and felt that the words were sadly true.\n\nThe nurse told granny that the child was dying, not of the blow on the\nhead, but of swift decline. Nothing could save her, she said. The shock\nto her nervous system had of course hastened the end; but for that she\nmight have lived till another spring, but certainly not longer. She did\nnot seem to suffer in the least. Hour after hour she lay quite still,\nwhile the tide of her little life ebbed swiftly out, and the darkness\nstole on apace; but she did not fear the gloom. The brave little heart\nthat had borne so patiently the frowns of an unkindly world, was now\nresting in the love of God.\n\nThe smile that had so long flickered over her face like firelight on a\nwall, now settled into a look of deep content. No murmur ever escaped\nher lips, not even a sigh; now and then her lips moved as if in prayer,\nthat was all.\n\nAnd thus she lay waiting for the messenger that should still the little\nheart into an everlasting rest, and listening for the footfalls that\nshould tell of the coming of her Lord.\n\nAfter her last look at Benny, she was never seen to open her eyes again,\nbut gradually sank to rest.\n\n  So fades a summer's cloud away,\n    So sinks the gale when storms are o'er,\n  So gently shuts the eye of day,\n    So dies a wave along the shore.\n\nTwo days after, Joe and Benny went together to the Infirmary. But they\nwere too late: the pure spirit had gone to God, and the little tired\nfeet were for ever at rest.\n\n\"Cannot we see her?\" said Benny.\n\n\"No, you had better not,\" was the reply.\n\nBenny felt it very keenly that he might not see his little dead sister,\nand yet it was best.\n\nThey were told, however, if they would be at the New Cemetery at the\neast of the town on the following day, they might see her buried, and\nmark her grave.\n\nIt was a cold cheerless afternoon when little Nelly Bates was laid in\nher grave. There was no pomp or display about that funeral, for she was\nburied at the public expense. Only two mourners stood by the grave,\nBenny and Joe, but they were mourners indeed.\n\nBenny went from the grave-side of little Nell to his corner under\ngranny's stairs, and sobbed himself to sleep. And Joe went to his hut to\nmuse on the mercy of God, and to revel in his new-found hope of heaven.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nThe Tide turns.\n\n  Be what thou seemest: live thy creed,\n    Hold up to earth the torch divine;\n  Be what thou prayest to be made;\n    Let the great Master's steps be thine.\n                                  --Bonar.\n\n\nHow Benny lived through the next few weeks he never knew. It seemed to\nhim as if the world had become suddenly dark. The one little being who\nhad been the sunshine of his life was buried up in the damp cold grave,\nand now there seemed nothing to live for, nothing to work for, nothing\neven to hope for; for what was all the world to him now his little Nell\nwas gone?\n\nHe missed her everywhere, and was continually fancying he saw her\nrunning to meet him as he drew near the church where they had regularly\nmet for so long a time; and sometimes he would turn round with a sudden\nstart, and with the word \"Nelly\" on his lips, as he fancied he heard the\npattering of her little feet behind him.\n\nHe grew despondent, too. While Nelly lived there was some one to work\nfor, some one to bear rebuffs and insults for; but now what did it\nmatter whether he sold his matches or not? He could go hungry; he did\nnot mind. In fact, he did not seem to care what became of him. There\nseemed to him nothing to fight the world for--nothing.\n\nBut for Joe he would have moped his life away in some dark corner where\nno one could see him. But Joe taught him to believe that his little\nsister was not lost, only gone before, and that perhaps she looked down\nupon him from heaven, and that it might grieve her to see him fretting\nso.\n\nSo he tried to sell his matches or earn a penny in some other way in a\nlistless, hopeless manner. But it was very hard work. And when evening\ncame he would drag himself wearily to his little corner under granny's\nstairs, and generally sob himself to sleep. He missed his little\ncompanion in the evenings almost more than at any time, and wished that\nhe had died with her.\n\nSometimes he went out to the cemetery to see her grave; and no one knew\nwhat the little fellow suffered as he knelt there with clasped hands,\ndropping scalding tears upon the cold earth that hid his little sister\nfrom his sight.\n\nHe seemed to take no comfort in anything, not even in the story-books\nthat granny had hunted up for him, and which he was beginning to read so\nnicely. He was proud of his learning while Nelly lived; but all that was\nchanged now.\n\nAnd so the weeks wore away, and winter came in dark and cold. But people\ngenerally did not seem to mind the darkness nor the cold, for Christmas\nwas drawing near, and they were anticipating a time of mirth and\nmerrymaking, of friendly greetings and family gatherings.\n\nThe trains began to be crowded again with homecomers for their holidays;\nshopkeepers began to vie with each other as to which could present\nin their windows the grandest display; the streets were crowded with\nwell-dressed people who were getting in a stock of Christmas cheer; and\neverywhere people seemed bent on enjoying themselves to the utmost of\ntheir ability.\n\nAll this, however, only seemed to make Benny sadder than ever. He\nremembered how the Christmas before Nelly was with him, and he was as\nhappy and light-hearted as he well could be. Yet now the very happiness\nof the people seemed to mock his sorrow, and he wished that Christmas\nwas gone again.\n\nOne bitterly cold afternoon he was at his old place, waiting for the\nrailway boat to come up to the stage, in the hope that some one of\nits many passengers would permit him to carry his or her bag, when\nhe noticed a gentleman standing against the side of the boat with a\nportmanteau in his right hand, and holding the hand of a little girl in\nhis left.\n\nThe boat was a long time coming to, for a heavy sea was running at the\ntime, and the gentleman seemed to get terribly impatient at the delay.\nBut Benny was rather glad of it, for he had abundant opportunity of\nlooking at the little girl, whose pleasant, smiling face reminded him\nmore of his little dead sister than any face he had ever seen.\n\n\"Golly, ain't she purty!\" said Benny to himself; \"and don't that woolly\nstuff look hot round her jacket! And what long hair she have!--a'most as\nlong as little Nell's,\" and he brushed his hand quickly across his eyes.\n\"An' she looks good an' kind, too. I specks the gent is her par.\"\n\nAnd Benny regarded the gentleman more attentively than he had hitherto\ndone.\n\n\"Well now, ain't that cur'us!\" he muttered. \"If that ain't the very gent\nwhose portmantle I carried the night faather wolloped me so. I'll try my\nluck agin, for he's a good fare, an' not to be sneezed at.\"\n\nBy this time the gangway had been let down, and the gentleman and his\nlittle girl were among the first to hurry on to the stage. In a moment\nBenny had stepped forward, and touching his cap very respectfully, said,\n\n\"Carry yer bag, sir?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the gentleman shortly, and hurried on.\n\n\"Oh, please, sir, do!\" said Benny, his eyes filling with tears. \"I's had\nno luck to-day.\"\n\nBut the gentleman did not heed his tears or his pleading voice. He had\nbeen annoyed at the delay of the boat, and he was in no mood to brook\nfurther delay. So he said sternly,\n\n\"Be off with you this moment!\"\n\nBenny turned away with a great sob, for since Nelly died rebuffs had\nbecome doubly hard to bear. He did not try to get another fare, but\nstood looking out on the storm-tossed river, trying to gulp down the\ngreat lumps that rose continually in his throat.\n\n\"I specks I'll have to starve,\" he thought bitterly, \"for I can't get a\ncopper to-day nohow.\"\n\nJust then he felt a touch on his arm, and turning his brimming eyes, he\nsaw the little girl he had noticed on the boat.\n\n\"What's the matter, little boy?\" she said, in a voice that sounded like\nmusic to the sad-hearted child.\n\nThey were the first kind words that had been spoken to him for the day,\nand they completely broke him down.\n\nAt length he stammered out between his sobs,\n\n\"Oh, I's so hungry an' cold, an' little Nelly's dead; an' all the world\nis agin me.\"\n\n\"Have you no father?\" she said.\n\n\"No; I's no father, nor mother, nor sister, nor nobody. Nelly was all I\nhad in the world, an' now she's dead.\"\n\n\"Poor boy!\" said the kindly little voice. \"And how do you get your\nliving?\"\n\n\"Oh, I sells matches or carries gents' portmantles when they'll let me,\nor anything honest as turns up.\"\n\n\"Well, don't think papa is unkind because he spoke cross to you, but he\nhad been annoyed. And here is a shilling he gave me to-day; you need it\nmore than I do, so I will give it to you. Are you here every day?\"\n\n\"Ay, I's mostly here every day,\" said Benny, closing his fingers around\nthe bright shilling as one in a dream.\n\nThe next moment he was alone. He looked everywhere for the little girl,\nbut she was nowhere visible.\n\n\"Golly!\" said Benny, rubbing his eyes, \"I wonder now if she wur a\nhangel. Nelly said as 'ow the Lord 'ud provide. An' mebbe He sent her\nwith that bob. I wish I had looked more particler to see if she had\nwings, 'cause Nelly said as how hangels had wings.\"\n\nMore than twenty times that afternoon Benny looked at the bright new\nshilling that had been given him; the very sight of it seemed to do him\ngood. It seemed to turn the tide, too, in his favour, for before dark\nhe had earned another shilling; and that evening he trudged to his home\nwith a lighter heart than he had known for many a week.\n\nThe weather on Christmas Eve was anything but orthodox. There was\nneither frost nor snow; but, on the contrary, it was close and sultry.\nBenny had been out in the neighbourhood of Edge Hill with a big bundle\nfor a woman, who dismissed him with three halfpence, and the remark that\nyoung vagabonds like he always charged twice as much as they expected to\nget. So Benny was trudging home in a not very happy frame of mind. He\nhad been tolerably fortunate, however, during the early part of the day,\nand that compensated him to some extent for his bad afternoon's work.\n\nAs he was passing along a street in the neighbourhood of Falkner Square\nhe was arrested by the sound of music and singing. Now, as we have\nhinted before, Benny was very sensitive to the influence of music, and,\nin fact, anything beautiful had a peculiar charm for him. The window of\nthe house before which he stopped stood slightly open, so that he was\nnot only able to hear the music, but also to distinguish the words that\nwere being sung.\n\nIt was a pure childish voice that was singing to a simple accompaniment\non the piano,--\n\n \"There is beauty all around,\n    When there's love at home;\n  There is joy in every sound,\n    When there's love at home.\n  Peace and plenty here abide,\n  Smiling sweet on every side;\n  Time doth softly, sweetly glide,\n    When there's love at home.\"\n\nBenny waited, as if rooted to the ground, until the song ended; waited\na minute longer in the hope that the singer would begin again. And in\nthat minute the little singer came to the window and looked out and saw\nour hero; and Benny, looking up at the same moment, saw the face of his\nangel, and hurried away out of sight, as if he had been guilty of some\nwrong.\n\nThe little singer was Eva Lawrence, the daughter of a well-to-do man of\nbusiness in the town. She was not ten years of age by several months,\nbut she was unusually thoughtful for her age, and was as kind-hearted as\nshe was thoughtful.\n\nAs soon as Mr. Lawrence had finished his tea that evening, and had\nbetaken himself to his easy chair, little Eva clambered upon his knee,\nand, putting her arms about his neck, said,\n\n\"Papa, what do you think?\"\n\n\"Oh, I think ever so many things,\" he replied, laughing.\n\n\"Now, you naughty man, you're going to tease again. But I've begun wrong\nway about, as usual. I want to ask a favour.\"\n\n\"I expected as much, Eva,\" said her father, smiling. \"But how many more\nChristmas presents will you want?\"\n\n\"But this is not a present exactly.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed,\" he said, pretending to look serious.\n\n\"Now, don't be a tease,\" she said, pulling his whiskers, \"for I'm quite\nserious. Now listen.\"\n\n\"I'm all attention, my dear.\"\n\n\"You want a little boy to run errands and sweep out the office, and do\nlittle odd jobs, don't you?\"\n\n\"Well, who has been telling you that?\"\n\n\"Nobody, papa; I only wanted to know, you see. So you do, don't you?\"\n\n\"Well, I shall the beginning of the year, for the boy I have is leaving.\nBut what has that to do with my little girl?\"\n\n\"Well, papa, our teacher is always telling us that we ought to be little\nmissionaries, and lend a helping hand to the needy whenever possible,\nand do all the good we can.\"\n\n\"Quite right, my dear; but I can't see yet what my little girl is\ndriving at.\"\n\n\"Well, she was telling us only last Sunday that lots of people would\nbe better if they had better surroundings; and that if something could\nbe done to get those little street Arabs more out of the reach of\ntemptation, they might grow up to be good and honest men and women.\"\n\n\"Well, Eva?\"\n\n\"Well, papa, I should like for you to give one of those little street\nboys a chance.\"\n\n\"Who do you mean?\"\n\n\"That poor boy I gave the shilling to on the landing-stage the other\nday, don't you remember--when you called me a silly girl?\"\n\n\"And were you not silly, Eva?\"\n\n\"No, papa, I don't think I was; for I am sure the boy is not bad, he has\nsuch honest eyes. And he said he had no father, nor mother, nor brother,\nnor sister, and he seemed in such trouble.\"\n\n\"Well, my child?\"\n\n\"You know now what I mean, papa. I confess I had quite forgotten the\npoor boy till this afternoon I saw him standing in front of the house. I\nhad been singing 'Love at Home,' and he had been listening, I think; and\nI fancy it had made him sad, for his eyes were full of tears, but when\nhe saw he was noticed he hurried away as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"And suppose I should decide to employ this boy, Eva, where should I\nfind him?\"\n\n\"Oh, he said he was nearly always on the landing-stage. He sold matches\nthere, except when he was running errands.\"\n\n\"Well, I will think about it, Eva.\"\n\n\"Oh, promise, papa, there's a good man.\"\n\n\"I don't believe in making rash promises, Eva,\" said Mr. Lawrence\nkindly; \"and, besides, I have very little faith in those street boys.\nThey are taught to be dishonest from their infancy, and it is a\ndifficult matter for them to be anything else; but I'll think about it.\"\n\nAnd Mr. Lawrence was as good as his word; he did think about it, and,\nwhat is more, he decided to give the little boy a trial.\n\nBenny was on the landing-stage on New Year's Day when Mr. Lawrence was\nreturning from Chester. He had scarcely left the railway boat when\nseveral lads crowded around him with \"Carry yer bag, sir?\" Benny among\nthe number.\n\nHe quickly recognized our hero from the description Eva gave, and placed\nhis bag in Benny's hand, giving him the address of his office. Arrived\nthere, much to Benny's bewilderment, he was invited inside, and Mr.\nLawrence began to ply him with questions, all of which he answered in a\nstraightforward manner, for there was little in his life that he cared\nto hide.\n\nMr. Lawrence was so much impressed in the boy's favour that he engaged\nhim at once, promising him two shillings a week more than he had\nintended to give.\n\nWhen Benny at length comprehended his good fortune--for it was some time\nbefore he did--he sobbed outright. Looking up at length with streaming\neyes, he blurted out, \"I can't tell 'e how 'bliged I is,\" and ran out of\nthe office and hurried home to tell granny the news, not quite certain\nin his own mind whether he was awake or dreaming.\n\nGranny was upstairs when Benny burst into the room, and when she came\ndown the first thing she saw was Benny standing on his head.\n\n\"Oh, granny,\" he shouted, \"I's made my fortin! I's a gent at last!\"\n\nGranny was a considerable time before she could really discover from\nBenny what had happened; but when she did discover she seemed as pleased\nas the child. And a bigger fire was made up, and a more sumptuous supper\nwas got ready in honour of the occasion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nA Glimpse of Paradise.\n\n  I know not how others saw her,\n    But to me she was wholly fair;\n  And the light of the heaven she came from\n    Still lingered and gleamed in her hair;\n\n  For it was as wavy and golden\n    And as many changes took\n  As the shadow of sunlight ripples\n    Or the yellow bed of a brook\n                      --J.R. Lowell.\n\n\nFor the next month Benny lived in a seventh heaven of delight. The only\ndrawback to his happiness was that Nelly was not alive to share his good\nfortune. Time was mercifully blunting the keen edge of his sorrow, and\nday by day he was getting more reconciled to his loss. Yet never a day\npassed but that he wished a hundred times that his little sister were\nstill with him, that they might rejoice together in his good fortune. He\nknew that she was better off, and even hoped that she was not altogether\nignorant of his success in life. Yet how much pleasanter it would have\nbeen, he thought, if they could have journeyed on through life together.\n\nBenny had wonderful dreams of future success. Though not of a very\nimaginative temperament, he could not help occasionally indulging in\ndaydreams and castle-building, and some of his castles, it must be\nadmitted, were of the most magnificent description.\n\nHe saw the glowing heights before him, the summits of which others had\nreached, and why might not he? He certainly had commenced the ascent:\nwhat was there to hinder him from reaching the top? Had not granny\ntold him of poor Liverpool boys who, by perseverance and honest toil,\nhad become wealthy men, and were now occupying high and honourable\npositions? Surely, then, there was a chance for him, and if he did not\nsucceed it should not be for want of trying.\n\nHe felt that already he had got his foot on the first rung of the\nladder, and if there was any chance of his reaching the top he would do\nit. And as he thought thus, the future opened out before him in glowing\nvistas of unimagined beauty.\n\nHe knew that he must wait many years; that he must work hard and\npatiently; that perhaps many difficulties would arise that he could not\nforesee; still, still, across the boggy valley the mountain rose up with\nits sunlighted crown, and the question came back--Others had reached the\ntop, then why might not he?\n\nIt is true he never attempted to put these thoughts into words. They\nseemed to him too big for utterance; yet they were always with him,\nlightening his toil and brightening the long future that lay before him.\n\nIf Benny had been of a less practical turn of mind, he might have done\nwhat so many others have done--dreamed his life away, or waited idly for\nfortune to drop her treasures in his lap. But Benny, notwithstanding his\noccasional daydreams, was sufficiently matter-of-fact to know that if he\nwas to win any success in life, it must be by hard work.\n\nHe was already able to read very creditably. But now a new desire seized\nhim--he would learn to write as well. But how was he to begin? He had to\nconfess that that was a poser, for neither granny nor Joe could give him\nany assistance. Still he had set his heart upon learning to write, and\nhe was not to be defeated.\n\nSo one day he said to one of Mr. Lawrence's clerks,\n\n\"Does yer think, Mr. Morgan, that I could learn to write if I was to try\nvery hard?\"\n\n\"Of course you could, Benny,\" said Mr. Morgan, looking kindly down into\nthe dark earnest-looking eyes of the office boy. For Benny had done\nseveral little things for Mr. Morgan, and so that gentleman was disposed\nto be kind to the little waif.\n\n\"But how is I to begin?\" said Benny eagerly.\n\n\"I'm busy now,\" said Mr. Morgan, \"but if you will wait till to-morrow,\nI'll bring you a slate and pencil, and will set you a copy, and then\nyou'll be able to begin right off.\"\n\nJust then Mr. Lawrence called Benny from the inner office, and sent him\nwith a note to Mrs. Lawrence, with instructions to wait for an answer.\n\n\"You know the way, Benny?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"But you've never been to the house?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Then how do you know the way?\"\n\n\"It's where you has the music an' 'love at home,' sir, ain't it?\"\n\nMr. Lawrence smiled and said,\n\n\"You are on the right track, Benny, I think. Go to the house, and give\nthis note to the servant that opens the door, and say that you have to\nwait for an answer.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Benny, bowing very politely, and hurrying out of the\noffice.\n\nBenny had often longed to listen under the window of Mr. Lawrence's\nhouse that he might hear again the song that had so touched his heart,\nand see again the little angel face through whose intercession he owed\nhis good fortune; for Mr. Lawrence had hinted as much as that to him.\nBut even if nothing had ever been said, he would still have connected\nMr. Lawrence's kindness to him with his little daughter, who had spoken\nso kindly to him in the hour of his sorrow and despair, and whose bright\nshilling he still kept, and regarded with almost superstitious reverence.\n\nBut he had never dared to listen under the window again; he felt somehow\nas if he had no business in that neighbourhood, no right to look upon\nthe face of his little benefactress; so he kept away and spent his long\nwinter evenings by granny's fireside, poring over the few books that she\nand Joe were able to procure for him.\n\nBenny could not help wondering, as he hurried along the streets, holding\nthe letter very carefully in his hand, whether he would see again the\nlittle face at the window or hear her voice in song. He hoped that one\nor the other would greet him; but he was disappointed in both. No face\nwas at the window, no sound of music floated out on the bright frosty\nair.\n\nHe pulled the door-bell very timidly, and then waited a long time very\npatiently for the door to open. It was opened, however, at length, and,\nbowing very low, he said,\n\n\"Please, 'm, here's a letter from the master, an' I's to wait for an\nanswer.\"\n\n\"You'll have to wait some time, then,\" said the girl, scornfully, \"for\nMrs. Lawrence has gone out;\" and she shut the door with a bang.\n\n\"May I wait here?\" said Benny, looking round the roomy hall.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the girl; \"I'll have no brats in the kitchen; you can sit on\nthat chair if you like;\" and she hurried downstairs.\n\nBenny obeyed, and sat for a long time holding his cap between his knees.\nAt length, as he was growing rather impatient, he heard a light step on\nthe stairs near him, and, looking up, he saw his little benefactress\ndescending, carrying a huge doll in her arms.\n\nBenny felt himself growing hot all over, for he had no idea whether it\nwas the proper thing to stand or sit still, so he shuffled about on his\nchair in a very uneasy manner.\n\nThe little girl looked at him curiously for a moment, and then came\ntowards him, saying,\n\n\"Are you not Benny, that papa has in his office?\"\n\n\"Yes, 'm,\" said Benny, shuffling dangerously near the edge of the chair,\nand blushing to the roots of his hair.\n\n\"Don't be frightened,\" she said, noticing his embarrassment. \"I've been\nwanting a long time to see you. Are you waiting for something?\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said Benny, regaining his composure; \"the master sent me with a\nletter, an' told me to wait an answer.\"\n\n\"Well, mamma won't be in yet, so you can come into the nursery; it is\nwarm there.\"\n\nBenny had not the remotest idea what a nursery was, but he followed\nhis guide at what he thought a very respectful distance, and soon\nfound himself in the most wonderful room he had ever seen in his life.\nToys of every description were scattered about, and pictures of every\ndescription adorned the walls. A swing was suspended from the ceiling\nin the centre of the room, and in the nearest corner was a doll's\nhouse furnished in magnificent style. But what most attracted Benny's\nattention was a huge rocking-horse. At first he thought it was alive,\nbut soon found out his mistake, though his wonderment was not in the\nleast diminished by his discovery.\n\nLittle Eva Lawrence was evidently amused at Benny's astonishment, and\nafter regarding him for some time with a merry twinkle in her eyes, said,\n\n\"Did you never see a rocking-horse before, Benny?\"\n\n\"Never!\" was the laconic reply.\n\n\"Would you like to ride, Benny?\"\n\n\"Wouldn't I just!\" said Benny, his eyes beaming with pleasure.\n\n\"Well, here are the steps; take care you don't fall off, though,\" said\nEva.\n\n\"Oh, never fear,\" said Benny, mounting the horse. \"Now for 't, miss, an'\nsee if I ain't a stunner at it!\"\n\nAnd the next moment our hero was sprawling on the floor in the middle of\nthe room.\n\n\"Golly!\" he ejaculated, picking himself up with a bewildered air, and\nscratching his head. \"I's floored, to a sartinty.\"\n\n\"You tried to go too fast to begin with,\" laughed Eva; \"you'll do better\nnext time.\"\n\n\"May I try again?\" he questioned.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" was the reply; \"I want you to enjoy yourself.\"\n\nAnd enjoy himself he did, to his heart's content.\n\nAfter awhile Eva said, \"Now, Benny, I want to know more about you: won't\nyou tell me something about yourself and about your little sister?\"\n\n\"Ay, that I will, if you wish,\" said Benny, sitting down in a low chair\nbefore the fire. And in his simple childish way he told her all the\nstory with which the reader is acquainted--for he had lost all shyness\nnow--told it with a simple eloquence and pathos that brought the tears\nagain and again to his little listener's eyes. Ay, he wept himself when\nhe told of his little sister, of her goodness and of her love. He did\nnot even hide from his listener the story of his temptation, and how but\nfor his little Nelly he would have been a thief in act as well as in\nheart.\n\nWith the account of little Nelly's death Eva was much affected, and\nBenny sobbed again as the recollection of his loss came back to him.\n\n\"I thought I should ha' died when she were took,\" said he, between his\nsobs.\n\n\"Poor little boy!\" said Eva, soothingly; \"but you see your little\nsister's words have come true, after all.\"\n\n\"What words, miss?\"\n\n\"Why, what you told me just now, Benny,--how the Lord would provide.\"\n\n\"Oh, ay,\" said Benny, reflectively, \"though I wur as near as nothin' to\nstarvin' the day I fust seed you.\"\n\n\"Were you? Then perhaps the Lord sent me to help you.\"\n\n\"Oh, no doubt on that score,\" said Benny, stoutly; \"I's sartin about\nthat matter.\"\n\n\"Do you go to Sunday-school, Benny?\"\n\nBenny shook his head.\n\n\"Nor to church or chapel?\"\n\n\"Not since that night me an' Nelly went, that I told you 'bout.\"\n\n\"How is that?\"\n\n\"Well, we did try to get into another place o' the sort, smarter like,\nbut the gent at the door shoved us out, an' said there wur no room for\nsuch brats as us, an' told us to be off 'bout our bizness.\"\n\n\"Poor boy!\" said Eva, wondering if he came to the chapel she attended\nif he would not receive similar treatment.\n\nAt length she looked up and said, \"I would go to that chapel again, that\nyou and Nelly attended, if I were you, on a Sunday. It would not be\nclosed then, and I'm sure that kind gentleman would be glad to have you\nin the Sunday-school.\"\n\n\"Oh, then, I'll go,\" said Benny, who felt that this little girl's wish\nwas law to him.\n\nSoon after Mrs. Lawrence came in, read her husband's note without a\nword, and hastily wrote a reply.\n\n\"Make haste, Benny,\" she said kindly, giving him the letter she had\nwritten. \"I'm afraid Mr. Lawrence will think you've been away a very\nlong time.\"\n\nBenny took the letter without a word, and hurried away with a heart full\nof gratitude for the kindly treatment he had received. It seemed to him\nas if that day he had had a glimpse of Paradise, and had spoken to one\nof God's angels face to face.\n\nHow bright and smooth his path of life was growing! He almost feared\nsometimes that he was dreaming, and that he would awake and find himself\ndestitute and forsaken.\n\nHe was now beginning to enjoy life, and as he looked back upon the past\nhe almost wondered how he and his little sister had managed to live in\nthose dark years of cold and want.\n\nWhen Joe Wrag first heard of Benny's good fortune, he lifted up his\nhands, and said in a voice of reverence,\n\n\"The Lord is good! the Lord is good!\" Then after a moment's pause he\nwent on, \"But oh! what an old sinner I've a-been, to be sure.\"\n\n\"How so?\" said Benny.\n\n\"How so? 'cause as how I turned my back upon God, an' tried to persuade\nmysel' that He had turned His back on me. Oh, I did, lad, an' in my\nheart I called Him 'ard names. I didn't dare say it wi' my lips, but in\nmy heart, boy, I said He wur cruel--that He wur a monster, that He had\nno feelin', that He had shut the door agin' me, when all the time He wur\na-sayin', 'Joe, come back, come back, for there's room in the Father's\nheart and home for thee.' But, oh! praise His name, He sent His hangel\nto tell poor owd Joe the way, an' reveal the Father's love--He did, boy,\nfor sure.\"\n\n\"His hangel, Joe?\" said Benny, trying in vain to comprehend all Joe had\nsaid.\n\n\"Ay, His hangel, boy. An' that hangel wur little Nell, bless her! she's\nwi' Him now, in the land where there's no more sorrow nor pain, an'\nJoe's on the way.\"\n\nAnd the old man looked up into the star-bespangled sky, as if he would\nlook through the very floor of heaven.\n\nBenny thought of all this, as he hurried from Mr. Lawrence's door, and\nfelt as if he, too, had had an angel sent from God to help him on the\nway to heaven.\n\nPoor boy! he did not see the heavy cloud that was gathering in the sky,\nnor the dark and painful paths that lay before him, which he, with\nbruised and bleeding feet, would have to tread. He only saw the promised\nland, bathed in sunshine and clad in beauty, a land where plenty reigned\nand want could never come, and knew not of the weary wilderness that lay\nbetween. He thought that he had passed through the wilderness already,\nand that all the sorrow, and hunger, and pain lay behind him.\n\nIt was well he did so. Let him enjoy the sunshine while it lasts, and\ndream his happy dreams of coming joy. The awaking will come all too\nsoon. Poor boy! may God protect him in the struggle of life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nA Terrible Alternative.\n\n  Sow truth, if thou the true wouldst reap,--\n    Who sows the false shall reap the vain;\n  Erect and sound thy conscience keep,\n    From hollow words and deeds refrain.\n\n  Sow love, and taste its fruitage pure;\n    Sow peace, and reap its harvest bright;\n  Sow sunbeams on the rock and moor,\n    And reap a harvest home of light\n                              --Bonar.\n\n\nThe days of peace and sunshine sped all too swiftly. Winter soon gave\nplace to budding spring, and spring lengthened into summer. Twelve\nmonths had passed since that happy day in Eastham Woods, for June had\ncome again; and the parks and squares were once more green, and the\nstreets were hot and dusty.\n\nIt had been a strange year to Benny. Pain and pleasure had strangely\ncommingled. Never had he felt such sorrow, never had he known such joy.\nThe old year had closed in sorrow and despair; the new year had opened\nin joy and hope.\n\nBenny had grown much during those twelve months, for neither the\nchastening of grief nor the stimulus of kindness had been lost upon\nhim. Both had done him good, and so the year had been to him one of\ngrowth--growth in every sense. He had grown physically. He was barely\ntwelve yet, but he was well developed for his age; especially so\nconsidering how little had been the care bestowed on his childhood. His\nface was open and pleasant, and there was a frank honest expression in\nhis eyes that won him favour wherever he went.\n\nHe had grown, too, mentally. Mr. Morgan had regularly set him copies,\nand Mr. Lawrence, discovering his eagerness to learn, had lent him\nbooks that would help him in the pursuit of knowledge. He became a most\ndiligent student. At first he sought after knowledge as a means to an\nend. He believed that it would help him in the race of life. But the\nfarther he advanced the pleasanter became his studies, and knowledge\nbecame precious for its own sake. What at first he set before himself as\na stern and even unpleasant duty, became at last a joy and delight.\n\nHe was eager also to improve his manners. He was anxious to speak\ncorrectly, and not be a disgrace to the gentleman who employed him and\nthe butt of the clerks. And it was wonderful what progress he made in\nthis respect. It is true that he frequently forgot himself, and the old\nexpressions that habit had made familiar rolled easily from his tongue.\nBut he had made up his mind to conquer, and he was certainly succeeding.\n\nAnd last, but not least, he had grown morally. For three months he had\nregularly attended the Sunday-school, and among the five hundred boys\nand girls that assembled regularly week after week there was not a\nmore diligent inquirer than Benny. The spiritual discernment that Joe\nWrag thought he lacked was being given, and the \"old, old story\" was\nbeginning to have a wonderful fascination for him.\n\nMr. Lawrence was wonderfully pleased with his _prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9_, and had decided\nthat if during the next six months he made such progress as he had done\nin the past, he should be promoted to a higher position.\n\nBenny regarded his fortune as made. Never had life seemed so bright\nto him as, one Saturday afternoon, he was busy at work putting Mr.\nLawrence's office in order. There was no one in the office but himself.\nMr. Lawrence had just left, giving him instructions that he must wait\ntill Mr. Morgan returned, who would lock up the offices, and then he\n(Benny) must bring up the keys to his residence.\n\nBenny had swept out the inner office, put the few books that were lying\nabout in their proper places on the shelves, and was busy dusting the\nfurniture, humming to himself the song that haunted him continually--\n\n \"There is beauty all around,\n    When there's love at home,\"\n\nwhen Mr. Lawrence came in hurriedly, and went straight to his desk and\nbegan to search carefully among the few papers that were lying on it;\nthen he looked behind it, around it, and underneath it, but it was\nevident, from the perplexed look on his face, that he could not find\nwhat he was in search of.\n\n\"Benny,\" he called, \"come here.\"\n\nAnd Benny came in from the outer office, to which he had retired on Mr.\nLawrence's appearance.\n\n\"Has Mr. Morgan returned yet?\" demanded Mr. Lawrence, in a stern voice.\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Benny, wondering what had happened.\n\n\"Has any one been here since I left?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"You are quite sure?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, quite sure.\"\n\n\"Then will you tell me what has become of the five-pound note that I\nleft lying on the desk when I went out?\" And he looked straight in\nBenny's face.\n\nBenny turned pale, for he knew what the question implied, but he did\nnot quail before Mr. Lawrence's stern gaze, and, looking his employer\nstraight in the eyes, he answered,\n\n\"I do not know, sir; I have not seen it.\"\n\n\"Now, Benny,\" said Mr. Lawrence, \"mind what you are saying.\"\n\nIn a moment his face flushed crimson as he answered,\n\n\"Did you ever know me lie, sir?\"\n\n\"No, Benny,\" answered Mr. Lawrence; \"I never did, nor steal either.\nThough I can quite conceive how, in a moment of weakness, you might be\ntempted to do both.\"\n\n\"But I've done neither,\" said Benny, with trembling lip.\n\nFor a moment Mr. Lawrence was silent, then he said,\n\n\"Look here, Benny. I left a five-pound note on the desk when I went out.\nI am quite certain of that--as certain as I am that I stand here at this\nmoment. And, according to your own statement, no one but yourself has\nbeen in the office since I left, and when I come back the note is gone.\nWhat am I to think?\"\n\n\"It's mighty queer, sir,\" said Benny, turning pale again; \"but I hope\nyou'll not think that I've took it.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid that I must think so.\"\n\nThen there was another pause, while Benny trembled from head to foot. At\nlength Mr. Lawrence spoke again.\n\n\"I do not wish to be hard with you, Benny,\" he said; \"and if you will\nonly confess that you have taken the note, I will forgive you.\"\n\n\"And if I was to tell a lie and say I took it, you would ask me for it\nat once, and I ain't got it.\" And Benny burst into tears.\n\n\"No, I will be more lenient still, for I know what a grief it will be to\nmy little girl when she hears about it. If you will only confess that\nyou have taken it, I won't even ask you to return it. But if you will\nnot confess, I'm afraid the law will have to take its course.\"\n\nPoor Benny! It was a terrible moment to him, and he tried to realize\nhow much depended upon his answer. By telling a lie he might still\nkeep his situation and the friendship of his little benefactress, and\nyet reach the heights to which his ambition pointed. But if he stuck\nto the truth, what would there be? A prison, perhaps, and then the old\nlife in the streets--hunger and weariness and cold. True, if he told a\nlie Mr. Lawrence would then have no doubt of his guilt. But, alas! he\nwould still believe him guilty if he told the truth, and not only Mr.\nLawrence, but every one else that knew him would regard him as a thief.\n\nIt was a terrible alternative. Tell a lie, and still go on the shining\nway that for months had been opening up before him; tell the truth, and\ngo back to the old life, that would now seem worse than death--go back\nto want and disgrace.\n\nAt one time he would not have been long in deciding the question. But\nconscience had been awakened since then, and, while he hesitated,\nthe little pale face of his dead sister rose up between him and his\nemployer, and a voice within seemed to whisper, \"Tell the truth, Benny,\nand the Lord will provide.\"\n\nIt was a brief interval since Mr. Lawrence had spoken, but in those few\nmoments Benny had fought the fiercest battle of his life, and had won\nthe victory.\n\nHe lifted his swimming eyes to Mr. Lawrence and said,\n\n\"I cannot tell a lie, sir.\" That was all.\n\nMr. Lawrence regarded him for a few moments in silence, then left the\noffice with a deeply puzzled expression on his face. He did not know\nwhat to think. Either Benny was honest or he was a most hardened thief,\nand somehow he felt that the boy could not be the latter. He had always\nfound him so truthful and thoughtful and obliging. There seemed nothing\nbad about the boy. And yet where could that note be if he had not taken\nit?\n\nAnd again he walked back into the office, and commenced a search more\ncareful and diligent than before, but all without avail: the note was\nnowhere to be found.\n\nSorely puzzled what to do, he left the office once more, and had\nscarcely got into the street when he stumbled across Police-inspector\nSharp.\n\n\"Good afternoon,\" said the inspector, touching his hat.\n\n\"Good afternoon,\" said Mr. Lawrence, passing on. He had not gone many\nsteps, however, before he turned back.\n\n\"I don't know but that it is a fortunate thing, Sharp, that I have met\nyou,\" he said. \"The fact is, I'm in a bit of a difficulty, and I don't\nknow a more likely man than you to help me out.\"\n\n\"I'm at your service, sir,\" said Mr. Sharp, \"and if I can render you any\nassistance, I shall be most happy to do so.\"\n\n\"Well, the fact is,\" said Mr. Lawrence, and he went on to tell all\nthe circumstances connected with the missing note, and finished up by\nsaying, \"But somehow I cannot for the life of me believe the boy has\nstolen it.\"\n\n\"Indeed, now,\" said Mr. Sharp, putting on a professional air, \"I cannot\nfor the life of me believe that the urchin has _not_ stolen it. So you\nsee my difficulty is in the opposite direction, Mr. Lawrence.\"\n\n\"But you don't know this lad, Mr. Sharp.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps, I don't know this particular young dog, but I know the\nwhole tribe of them,\" said Mr. Sharp, trying to look wise, \"and I tell\nyou they are all rogues and vagabonds, from the oldest to the youngest\nof 'em. Bless you, it is bred in their very bones, and they couldn't be\nhonest if they were to try ever so.\"\n\n\"But this boy has been with me six months, and a nicer lad I never knew.\"\n\n\"Ay, yes, Mr. Lawrence, their cunning is amazing; and they can play the\nhypocrite equal to old Satan himself. I tell you what, sir, if you had\nhad the experience of 'em that I've had, you'd mistrust the whole tribe\nof 'em.\"\n\n\"Well, I dare say, Sharp, you know more about them than I do, and I\nconfess that it was with some amount of misgiving that I engaged the\nboy; but he has never taken anything before.\"\n\n\"Did you ever give him the chance?\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps not,\" said Mr. Lawrence, looking thoughtful.\n\n\"Just so,\" said Inspector Sharp. \"The young dog has patiently waited his\nopportunity. Oh, bless you, sir, they know their game.\"\n\n\"But what had I better do?\" said Mr. Lawrence, looking puzzled.\n\n\"If you'll leave the matter to me,\" said Mr. Sharp, \"_I'll_ work the\noracle for you, and very likely restore you the missing money.\"\n\n\"I'm very unwilling to prosecute,\" said Mr. Lawrence, in a troubled tone\nof voice.\n\n\"Just so, just so. I quite understand your feeling. But you'll not have\nneed to do much in that direction, I can assure you,\" said Mr. Sharp, in\na patronizing manner.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Lawrence, looking like a man that had made up his mind\nto submit to a painful operation, \"I'll leave the matter in your hands.\"\n\nHalf an hour later, as Benny stood in the street waiting until Mr.\nMorgan had locked the doors, a police constable came forward and touched\nhim on the arm.\n\n\"You'll come with me!\" he said. \"I've found fresh lodgings for you\nto-night.\"\n\n\"Did Mr. Lawrence send you?\" said Benny, the tears standing in his eyes.\n\n\"The orders came from him in the first place,\" said the policeman; \"he\nintends to stop your cribbing for a week or two.\"\n\n\"Oh, but I didn't steal the money,\" sobbed Benny, \"I didn't really.\"\n\n\"They all say that,\" laughed the constable; \"but from what I can hear,\nyou're a particular cunning dog. However, you're caught this time.\"\n\nBenny felt that it was of no use saying any more, so he walked along by\nthe officer's side with the calmness of despair settling down upon his\nheart.\n\nHe had no wish to resist. He knew it would be useless for him to attempt\nto do so. He had lost everything now, and the only thing he hoped for\nwas that death might come speedily, and that he might soon be laid to\nrest by the side of his little sister, and be at peace for ever.\n\nHe thought everybody was looking at him, as the officer led him through\nthe streets, and he could not help feeling thankful now that Nelly was\ndead. Such disgrace would break her heart if she were alive. And for the\nfirst time he felt glad that she was sleeping in her grave.\n\nHow changed everything had become in one short day! A few hours ago\nhe was mourning the loss of his sister; now he was glad that she was\nnumbered with the dead. But one short hour before the world had never\nseemed so bright, and he had thought how he should enjoy the beautiful\nsummer evening in Wavertree Park; now the world had never seemed so\ncheerless and dark, and his evening was to be spent in a prison cell.\n\nPoor boy! it is no wonder that he wished he might die, for every hope\nhad been blasted in an hour.\n\nOn arriving at the police station he was thrust into his cell without\na word. He was thankful to find that it was empty, for he wanted to be\nalone with his thoughts. Selecting the darkest corner, he crouched down\nupon the floor and rested his head upon his knees. He could not weep,\nhis grief was too great for tears. He could only think and think, until\nhis thoughts seemed to scorch his very brain. And as he crouched thus,\nwhile the hours of that summer's afternoon and evening dragged slowly\nalong, his whole life passed vividly before him, he seemed to live it\nall over again, and he asked himself if he could go back to the old life\nof hunger and cold in the streets.\n\nWhen Nelly was with him, and they knew no other life, they were not\nunhappy. But he had had a glimpse of Paradise since then. He had tasted\nthe joys of hope and had cherished dreams of a happy future, and he felt\nthat it would be easier to die than to return in disgrace to what he had\nthought he had left behind him for ever.\n\nIt was very hard that just as the world seemed brightest, and hope\nseemed growing into certainty--just as the path of life was getting\nclear, and the end seemed certain, that he should be thus thrust down,\nand thrust down to a lower depth than he had known in his darkest days.\n\nCould it be true, he asked himself again and again, that he, who had\nbeen trying so hard to be good and truthful and honest, was really in\nprison on a charge of theft? It had come upon him so suddenly that he\nthought sometimes it must be all some horrid dream, and that he would\nsurely awake some time and find the bright future still before him.\n\nAnd so the hours wore away, and the light faded in the little patch of\nsky that was visible through his high grated window, and the cell grew\ndarker and more dismal all the while.\n\nAt length there was a tramp of feet in the courtyard outside. The key\ngrated in the lock, the door flew open, and two lads were tumbled into\nthe cell. These were followed in half an hour by three others, and Benny\nbecame aware by the noises in the courtyard that other cells were being\nfilled as well as the one he occupied. And, as the darkness deepened,\nnight grew hideous with shouts, and laughter, and songs, and curses loud\nand deep.\n\nIt seemed to him as if he had got to the very mouth of hell. Nothing\nthat he had ever heard in Addler's Hall or Bowker's Row could at all\ncompare with what he heard that night: now there was the sound of blows;\nnow cries for help; now shrieks of murder, accompanied by volleys of\noaths and shouts of laughter.\n\nThe companions of his own cell were on the whole tolerably orderly,\nand were evidently disposed to make the best of their situation. They\nstarted several songs, but in every case broke down at the end of the\nsecond line, so at length they gave up trying, and settled themselves\ndown to sleep.\n\nIt was far on towards morning before all grew still, but silence did\ndrop down upon the prisoners at last; and Benny, weary with counting\nthe beats of his heart, dropped at length into a troubled sleep. It was\nlate in the morning when he awoke again, and for a moment he was unable\nto recall what had happened or where he was. Then the memory of the past\nevening rushed in upon him like a flood, and he buried his face in his\nhands in the misery of despair.\n\nHe wondered what granny would think of his absence, and what his teacher\nwould think in the Sunday-school. Alas! he should see them no more, for\nhow could he go to them with such a stain upon his name?\n\nWhile he was musing thus he was startled by a familiar voice addressing\nhim, and looking up he saw Perks looking at him, with a broad grin upon\nhis countenance.\n\n\"Well, this are a onexpected pleasure!\" he said. \"I's jolly glad to see\nyer, Ben. Yer see, I's of a very forgivin' natur'.\"\n\nBut Benny made no reply. He only wondered if his misery would ever end.\n\n\"In the dumps, eh?\" continued Perks. \"Well, I an' my mates'll help you\nout in quick sticks: now let's have a song all together. You ken take\nthe big end, that's the bass, yer know.\"\n\n\"I want to be quiet,\" said Benny; \"do let me alone.\"\n\n\"In course I'll let 'e alone. I looks like it, don't I? I's a very\nforgivin' natur', Mister Benjamin Bates, you knows that, though I don't\nforget. But the fact is, I's so pleased to 'ave yer company agin, that\nI'm bound to show my delight in some way.\"\n\n\"If you don't take yourself off, Perks, you'll wish you had,\" said Benny.\n\n\"Now, don't be touchy, Mr. Bates. But let's dance a cornpipe, while one\no' my mates whistles 'Pop goes the Weasel.'\"\n\nPoor Benny! he could not escape his tormentor, so he bore throughout\nthat weary Sabbath, as best he could, a series of petty persecutions. He\ntried to be patient, he even tried to pray, but the only prayer he could\nutter was, \"O Lord, kill me at once, and put me out of misery.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nAn Experiment.\n\n  Sow ye beside all waters,\n    Where the dew of heaven may fall;\n  Ye shall reap, if ye be not weary.\n    For the Spirit breathes o'er all.\n\n  Sow, though the thorns may wound thee:\n    One wore the thorns for thee;\n  And though the cold world scorn thee,\n    Patient and hopeful be.\n                  --Anna Shipton.\n\n\nWhile Benny in his prison-cell was dragging out the weary hours\nof that June Sabbath, Joe Wrag was engaged in an experiment that\nhad occupied his thoughts for some considerable time. Since that\nnever-to-be-forgotten day when he had kissed his little Nelly a last\ngood bye, he had never doubted three things:--First, that the elect were\n\"whosoever will;\" second, that he had been accepted of the Father; and,\nthird, that little Nelly Bates had been to him the \"sent of God,\" to\nlead him out of the darkness of error into the light of truth.\n\nThe certainty that he was included in God's invitation of mercy was to\nhim a new revelation. He felt as if he had suddenly grown young again,\nand, notwithstanding his grief for his little pet, he experienced a joy\nspringing up in his heart the like of which he had never known before.\n\nThe words that have comforted so many sorrow-bruised hearts--\"for we\nmourn not as those without hope, for them that sleep in Him\"--seemed to\nhim to have a new and deeper meaning. For he felt that not only was his\nlittle Nelly safe, but that he, too, was secure in the almighty love of\nGod.\n\nFor several weeks Joe hardly knew at times whether he was in the\nbody or out of it. Wrapped in contemplation, he would forget \"all\ntime and toil and care,\" and the long nights would slip away like a\ndream. He grew more silent than ever; but the look of melancholy was\nrapidly disappearing from his weatherbeaten face, and an expression of\nheart-rest and peace was taking its place.\n\nBut one morning, as Joe was walking home from his work, lost as usual in\ncontemplation, a thought crossed his mind that fairly startled him, and\nfor several moments he stood stock-still in the street.\n\n\"Oh, dear! oh, dear!\" he groaned. \"If I don't desarve to be reprobated,\nmy name's not Joe Wrag.\"\n\nThen he walked on again with rapid strides, as if he would escape the\nhaunting thought. But the thought would not leave him; nay, it seemed to\ngrow into a living voice, that sounded clear and distinct above the roar\nof the streets.\n\n\"Joe Wrag,\" it said, \"is your religion such a selfish thing, and is\nyour joy such a selfish thing, that you can think of nothing but\nyourself? Are you the only one for whom Christ died? Are there no tired\nand toil-worn men and women around you struggling in the darkness and\nlonging for light? Do you want heaven all to yourself, that you invite\nno one to go along with you? For shame, Joe Wrag, you are actually\ngrowing selfish! In your thankfulness that you have found a place of\nshelter, you have forgotten the many outside still exposed to the storm.\nIs this what you have learnt of Christ? Get down on your knees, man, and\nask His pardon, and ask Him for grace also that you may be saved from\nyourself, and that henceforth you may live for Christ and humanity.\"\n\n\"O Lord, have marcy!\" cried Joe, rushing on faster and faster. \"I've\nbeen as blind as a bat, an' as selfish as sin could make me. Enter not\ninto judgment with me for Thy marcy's sake, an' I'll try to do better--I\nwill, for sure.\"\n\nWhen Joe reached his home, he went at once to his bed-room, and, falling\non his knees, he poured out his soul in a long and agonizing prayer. He\nprayed for grace and strength, he prayed for light and wisdom. He did\nnot ask for peace or joy, but he asked to be made holy and useful, that\nhe might do diligently his life-work, and be able to say when death\ncame, \"I have finished the work that Thou gavest me to do.\"\n\nWhen Joe came downstairs a light was shining in his eyes, such as his\nwife (who had been for many years Joe's \"thorn in the flesh\") had never\nseen before.\n\nFrom that day Joe Wrag was a changed man, and, as might be expected,\nhis wife was the first to notice the change and the first to appreciate\nit. That very morning, instead of eating his meal in silence, as had\nbeen his custom for many years, he began to talk to her, to ask her\nquestions, and to interest himself in domestic affairs. And when he\nhad taken his four or five hours' sleep, instead of moping in silence,\nas he had been in the habit of doing, until it was time to go to his\nwork, he actually began to help his wife to tidy up the house, and even\nanticipated her wants in several little matters, and altogether made\nhimself so agreeable that his wife was at her wits' end to know what had\ncome over him.\n\nMary Wrag had grown, as the years had slipped by, from a light-hearted,\nhigh-spirited girl, into a sour, disappointed, and vixenish woman. Poor\nJoe was utterly at a loss to understand the change that had come over\nher. He could not think that he had contributed to it in the smallest\ndegree. He had never crossed her, never answered her back when she\nsnarled at him, never bothered her with his own troubles, and never\nvexed her by trying to pry into hers. He had always let her have her own\nway, and had scarcely interfered with her in anything, and hence it was\na mystery to him how she had grown so cross-grained and sour.\n\nIt was a very common mistake, and one that has been fraught with the\nmost serious results. He did not know how, in the years gone by, his\nwife had longed to share his troubles (for she was too proud to tell\nhim), and how she wanted him to share hers. He did not know what a\ntrouble it was to her when he sat hour after hour moody and silent,\nnever speaking to her, and taking no interest in anything she did or\nsaid. He did not know what bitter tears she shed in the early years of\ntheir wedded life, because he would not notice a new bow of pink ribbon\nshe had made, or a new fashion in which she had done up her glossy hair.\n\n\"I don't believe,\" she would say bitterly, \"that Joe cares a bit what I\nwears. It's not a bit of pleasure to try an' make oneself look nice, for\nhe never notices.\"\n\nAnd so she grew cross and sour. He never blamed her, it is true, but she\ncomplained to herself that he never praised her, and even when she got\nthoroughly out of temper and gave him a good \"blowing up,\" his silence\nonly exasperated her all the more.\n\n\"I'd rather a thousan' times over,\" she would say, \"that he'd get cross,\nan' answer back again, than sit still, turnin' up his eyes like a dyin'\ndolphin.\"\n\nHad Joe known all this, it would certainly have been a great trouble to\nhim, and yet if he had known it, it would doubtless have saved him many\nyears of pain.\n\nBut after the morning to which we have alluded, Joe's conduct and manner\nchanged in a remarkable degree. He became thoughtful and attentive and\ncommunicative, and he began to think, too, that his wife's temper was\nimproving; and after a few weeks he was surprised at the wonderful\nchange that had come over her, little dreaming that it was the change in\nhimself that had produced the change in his wife.\n\nThe experiment to which we alluded in the opening sentences of\nthis chapter was that of trying to get hold of his neighbours and\nacquaintances, and helping them if possible to a higher and better\nlife. There were people living all round him--some of them he had known\nfor twenty years--who never went to church or chapel, and who seemed\nutterly unconcerned about death and the great hereafter that lay beyond\nit--people whose life was one hopeless round of toil, with nothing to\nbrighten or cheer its dull monotony. Some of them were decent people\ntoo, honest and industrious. It is true they got drunk occasionally, and\nwere not always as civil to their wives and families and to each other\nas they might be; yet, notwithstanding, they had a soft place in their\nhearts, and were ever ready to watch by a sick neighbour's bed-side, or\nlend a helping hand to a mate more needy than themselves.\n\nHow to get hold of these children of the great Father, and lead them\ninto His fold, was a problem that had puzzled Joe for some time. At\nlength he decided, with his wife's consent, to invite them to tea, or as\nmany of them as could be accommodated, some Sunday afternoon, and when\nhe had got them together, to talk to them on those matters which were of\nsuch vital importance.\n\nAccordingly the invitations were sent out, and on the Sunday afternoon\nalready mentioned some fifteen men found their way to Joe Wrag's\ncottage, wondering what was in the wind.\n\nWhen they had all got comfortably seated on the forms that Joe had\nprovided, Joe stood up in a corner of the room, and looked around him:\nevidently it was no easy task to begin to talk. Joe had no idea that it\nwould be so difficult. Every eye was fixed upon him with a wondering\nexpression. Joe coughed two or three times, then making a tremendous\neffort, he said,\n\n\"You all know me, mates?\"\n\n\"Ay,\" they all exclaimed, \"we ought to, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Ay, jist so,\" said Joe, feeling more at ease now that the ice was\nbroken; \"but I've discovered lately, lads, that I ain't a-done my duty.\"\n\n\"Come, old boss, we ain't a-blamin' yer; so don't begin a ballyraggin'\nyoursel' in that way,\" said one of the men.\n\n\"Facts is stubborn, though,\" went on Joe, \"an' I see that I've kep'\nmysel' too much to mysel', an' I ain't a-been that neighbourly as I\nought to ha' been; but I intend to do differ'nt.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm hanged,\" said the man who had before spoken, \"if I ain't\nconsiderable at a loss, Joe, to know what yer drivin' at.\"\n\n\"I 'spects so, no doubt, but I'm not good at 'splainin'; but it 'pears\nto me, mates, as how we ain't got hold o' life by the right end.\"\n\n\"Yer mean _us_, Joe?\" questioned several voices together.\n\n\"Well, p'raps I do. Yer don't git much comfort in this life, and yer\nain't preparin' for a better life. Don't stop me; but I used to think\nthat heaven wern't for me, and for lots o' us poor chaps--that we\ndidn't belong to the elect; but, bless yer, lads, I know now, that\nthe elect are everybody as likes. We are all God's children, an' He\nloves us all, the bad 'uns as well as the good 'uns, an' He's promised\npardon an' heaven to whosoever will. Let me tell 'e lads, how it came\nabout. A little girl an' her brother comed an' axed me to let 'em warm\ntheirselves by my fire one pinchin' cold night. A purtier little critter\nthan little Nelly never breathed, wi' her great round eyes an' sweet\nmouth. I seem to see her now, though she's asleep in her grave. Well,\nwhen her father druv 'em from home, I got a place for 'em wi' Betty\nBarker. An' Betty used to read to 'em out o' the Testament. An' then\nthey got into a chapel, an' heerd a couple o' sermons--leastaway Nelly\ndid; the lad were asleep durin' the preachin'. Well, you can't tell\nhow eager that little gal became to know more about the Saviour, an'\nheaven, an' all the rest o' it. An' she used to come an' ax me all sorts\no' questions. Bless yer, that little girl had real speretuel insight;\nshe used to floor me complete. I never heerd sich posers as she used to\nput sometimes. But I tell 'e, mates, every one of the questions helped\nto lead me out o' the darkness into the light. Day after day it got\nclearer, an' yet I doubted. I spoke the promises to the little gal, and\nyet I were afeard to take 'em mysel'. I had a vision, too, one night,\nan' that helped me amazin'. But not until my little Nell was dyin' did I\nsee clear. The nurse said to me what she seed the little gal wanted to\nsay, an' that took down the last shutter, an' the light streamed in. I\ncan't tell yer all the joy, lads, I've felt, but for a long time I kept\nit all to mysel'. But the Lord has showed to me how selfish I've been,\nan' now I want for everybody to get close to the Saviour.\"\n\nFor a moment there was silence, then one of the men said,\n\n\"But there's wussur chaps 'n us goin'.\"\n\n\"Ay, that's true, lad,\" said Joe; \"but you're all bad enough to be\nbetter, an' the Saviour wants 'e all to be good, an' He wants to help 'e\nall to be patient an' bear the burden of life, an' He wants to show 'e\nhow much He loves an' cares for 'e all.\"\n\n\"I dunna think He ken love us very much,\" said one of the men sullenly,\n\"or He wouldn't ha' put us in this 'ere muck all our lives.\"\n\n\"Well, lads,\" replied Joe thoughtfully, \"I 'fess I can't 'splain all.\nAn' the Book tells us how we on'y see through a glass darkly. We looks\nat life an' the world an' everything through a smoked glass, an' it all\n'pears dark. But I tell 'e, lads, this I know, that God loves us, ay,\nloves us, and He'll make everything right and square by-and-bye, if we\nwill only leave it wi' Him.\"\n\n\"I dunna see much sign o' the love anywheres,\" said the man in reply.\n\n\"P'r'aps so,\" said Joe. \"But yer see, mates, as how sin an' the devil\nhave comed in th' world, an' they's made terrible mischief, terrible,\nand many o' us 'as bin 'elping the devil all we could, an' so between us\nwe's got oursels into a queer scrape, an' piled misery an' sorrow o' top\no' our 'eads. But God loved us so much that He sent the Saviour to take\naway our sin an' make us free. An' yet all the time we complain as if\nour Father made all the mischief an' trouble, when most o' us 'as a-made\nit oursels.\"\n\n\"Ay, that's true, lad,\" said Dick Somerset, the man that had spoken most.\n\n\"Course it are true,\" said Joe, brightening up. \"An', besides, it may be\na good thing for us to be kep' poor an' 'ave plenty o' 'ard work. The\nLord knows best, you may depend on 't, what's best for us; lots of us\ncouldn't stand riches, 't would be the greatest curse we could 'ave. I\nb'lieve if you place some people on a hoss they'd ride to the devil, but\nif you were to keep 'em in clogs they'd plod on all the way to Paradise.\"\n\n\"It's 'nation 'ard, though,\" said several of the men, \"to be allers\na-grindin' away at it as we's bound to do.\"\n\n\"Ay, lads,\" said Joe, \"that are true, an' yet I reckon we ain't a-tried\nvery much to better our position. Some o' yer 'as spent in drink what\nyer might a-saved, an' if yer 'ad a-done so, an' 'ad spent yer evenin's\nimprovin' yer mind an' gettin' some larnin', ye might ha' been better\noff. I might, I see it now quite clear; but as I said at the fust, we's\n'ad hold o' life by the wrong end. An' I wants us all to begin afresh.\"\n\n\"But how is we to do it, Joe?\" said several voices.\n\n\"Well, let's begin by axin' the Lord for pardon for all the past, an'\nfor strength to do better for the future.\"\n\nAnd Joe got down upon his knees at once and began to pray, and while he\npleaded the promises, it seemed to him as if the little room became full\nof the presence of the Most High. All his hesitancy of speech vanished.\nIt seemed to him as if he had got hold of the very hand of God, and he\ncried out, \"I will not let Thee go until Thou bless me.\" Promise after\npromise crowded into his mind with more rapidity than he could utter\nthem; until at length, overcome by his feelings, he cried out, \"I canna\ndoubt, I canna doubt no more!\" then he hid his face in his hands, and\nthere was silence throughout the room. When he rose from his knees his\nface fairly shone with joy, and the men looked wonderingly at him and at\neach other.\n\nJust then there was a knock at the little kitchen door, and Joe's wife\ncame in to say that she was waiting to bring in the tea.\n\n\"Right thee are, lass,\" said Joe. \"I'd nearly forgotten the tea; bring\nit away as fast as thee likes.\"\n\nAnd Mary Wrag and a neighbour's wife who had come in to help began\nto bring in large plates of cake and bread and butter, which the men\ngreedily devoured. It was very evident that whatever they thought of the\nother part of the service, they enjoyed this part of it.\n\nJoe was more pleased than he could tell at his experiment, and from\nthat day every Sunday afternoon his house was thrown open to any of his\nneighbours who might like to come in, and hear the Bible read, and have\na little conversation about spiritual things.\n\nIt was wonderful, now that the tongue of this silent man had been\nunloosed, how freely he could talk, and he never lacked a congregation.\nThe neighbours flocked to hear him talk of Jesus and of His wondrous\nlove, and in Joe's little kitchen many a weary and heavy-laden soul\nfound peace and rest.\n\nIn a little Bethel near his home Joe found a place to worship God. He\nloved now to be in the house of prayer. It no longer gave him pain to\ntalk of heaven and of the joys of the redeemed for he knew that heaven\nwas open to him, and that in a little while he would find again the\nlittle angel that led him into the light, and look upon the Saviour whom\nhe loved.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nPerks again.\n\n  I knew, I knew it could not last;\n  'T was bright, 't was heavenly, but 'tis past\n  Oh, ever thus from childhood's hour\n  I've seen my fondest hopes decay.\n  I never nursed a tree or flower,\n  But 't was the first to fade away;\n  I never nursed a dear gazelle\n  To glad me with its soft black eye,\n  But when it came to know me well.\n  And love me, it was sure to die.\n                        --Moore.\n\n\nOn the Monday morning Benny was brought before the magistrates, charged\nwith stealing five pounds from his master's office. He was almost ready\nto faint when placed in the dock; but, conscious of his own innocence,\nhe gathered up his courage, and answered fearlessly the questions that\nwere addressed to him.\n\nInspector Sharp gave the particulars of the case, adding that though\nthe money had not been found on the prisoner, or indeed anywhere else,\nyet he had no doubt that the lad had accomplices to whom he had given\nthe missing property.\n\nBenny denied most emphatically that he had seen the money: he admitted\nthat appearances were against him. \"But, oh,\" he said, looking at the\npresiding magistrate, his eyes swimming with tears, \"I'm not a thief,\nsir, if you'll on'y believe it; I'm not, really.\"\n\nBenny's honest face and simple straightforward answers evidently made\nin his favour; but as Mr. Lawrence had not appeared against him, he was\nremanded until the following day, so he was removed once more to his\ncell.\n\nPerks's case was not tried that day, so once more Benny had him for a\ncompanion.\n\nDuring most of the evening Perks sat in one corner, with his face in his\nhands, and his elbows on his knees, without either speaking or moving.\nBenny took the opposite corner, glad for once that he had a chance of\nbeing quiet. He wondered what would be done to him, whether he would be\nsent to prison or set at liberty. He felt that he did not care much what\nhappened, for to be penned up in prison, he thought, could not be much\nworse than to go back in disgrace to the old life of selling matches in\nthe street.\n\nAbove the grated window the little patch of blue began to fade as the\nday waned and darkened into night. Then a solitary star appeared, and\nlooked down with kindly eye into the dreary cell. Benny watched the star\ntwinkling so far above him, and wondered what it could be. Was it one of\nGod's eyes, or the eye of one of His angels? Could it be his Nelly that\nwas looking at him? Or were the stars only holes in the floor of heaven\nto let the glory through?\n\nHe could not tell, but somehow that kindly star looking in upon him\nseemed to comfort his heart; and he felt that though the world buffeted\nhim, and would not give him a chance of getting on, yet he was not\nforgotten of God.\n\nThen his thoughts turned to Perks. Was God watching him also? for the\nstar was not visible from the corner where he crouched. Why was he so\nquiet? Was he sorry for what he had done, or was he ill?\n\nBenny was glad to be quiet; and yet somehow as the darkness deepened he\nfelt lonesome, and wondered what had come to the silent figure in the\ncorner. It was so unusual for Perks to be quiet so long. He listened for\na moment, but all was still. And still the minutes dragged away, and the\nsilence became oppressive.\n\n\"Perks!\" said Benny, unable longer to keep quiet; and his voice awoke\nthe sleeping echoes of the cell, and made it sound hollow as a tomb.\n\nBut the echoes were his only answer.\n\n\"Perks!\" in a louder voice.\n\nStill there was silence, and Benny began to get frightened. Was he dead?\nhe wondered. How awful it would be to be in that cell all night alone\nwith a dead body!\n\n\"Perks, do speak!\" in a tone of agony.\n\nAnd he listened for an answer, while the perspiration stood in great\ndrops upon his forehead. But still only silence. He could hear the\nthumping of his own heart distinctly, and he became hot and cold by\nturns with fright.\n\nAt length he thought he heard a noise coming from the corner where he\nfelt sure Perks was crouched dead. It sounded like suppressed laughter.\nWhat could it mean? He dared not move from his corner. Was it Satan come\nto carry away Perks? for he was very wicked, he knew.\n\nIt had got too dark now to see anything distinctly; but there was a\nshuffling noise on the floor. Horrors! it was coming across the cell\ntowards him. What was it? He could see some unshapely thing moving.\nNow it was drawing itself up to its full height. Benny nearly shrieked\nout in an agony of terror. Then it flashed across his mind in a\nmoment--Perks was playing him another of his tricks.\n\nWaiting until Perks was near enough, he dealt him a blow straight from\nthe shoulder that sent him sprawling to the other end of the cell.\n\n\"Oh, lor a massy!\" he shouted, \"if that ain't a stinger!\"\n\n\"Serves you right,\" said Benny.\n\n\"Lor, but didn't I give you a scarin', just! I never did injoy a thing\nas much in my life; but, oh, lor! I nearly busted once or twice wi'\nlarfin'.\"\n\n\"I think I gived you a scarin' too,\" retorted Benny.\n\n\"Well, I confess it comed raather sudden like; so that's one to you,\nBen. I'll give you yer due.\"\n\n\"I've a good mind to pound you to a jelly,\" said Benny. \"Yer always on\nwith yer tricks.\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't 'tend to scare yer, Ben, for I wur bissy medertatin' on\na little plan I 'as in my yed; but when yer spoke 'Perks!' anxious like,\nthe idear comed to me all in a moment. Oh, lor, weren't it a spree!\"\n\n\"I don't see no fun in it,\" said Benny.\n\n\"Oh, lor, yer don't?\" and Perks laughed again. \"But I say, Ben, I wants\nyer 'elp in carryin' out as purty a bit o' play as ever you seen.\"\n\n\"Is it what you've been thinking about all the evenin'?\"\n\n\"Ay, lad, it's the most butifullest idear that wur ever 'atched in this\n'ere noddle; an' if you'll only 'elp me, my stars! our fortin's made.\"\n\n\"You're up to no good again, I'll be bound,\" said Benny.\n\n\"Well, I reckon you'll alter your mind on that score when yer 'ears the\ndetails o' my plan,\" said Perks, coming closer to Benny's side.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\"\n\n\"I must whisper it,\" said Perks, \"though I dunna thinks any bobbies is\naround listenin' at this time o' night, but it's allers best to be on\nthe safe side.\"\n\n\"I don't want to 'ear it,\" said Benny, \"if it's some'at you must\nwhisper. It's no good, that I'm sartin of.\"\n\n\"Don't be a ninny, Ben. Just listen.\"\n\nAnd Perks confided to Ben a plan of getting into the house of an old man\nwho kept a little shop, and lived all alone, and who kept all his money\nlocked up in a little cupboard in the room behind the shop.\n\n\"How do you know he keeps his money there?\" said Benny.\n\n\"Never you mind,\" was the answer; \"I does know it to a sartinty.\"\n\n\"Where does the old man live?\"\n\n\"No. 86 ---- Street.\"\n\n\"What's his name?\"\n\n\"Jerry Starcher. Ain't yer 'eard o' 'im?\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said Benny.\n\n\"Then you'll 'elp?\" said Perks, eagerly.\n\n\"Ay,\" said Benny, \"but not in the way you thinks.\"\n\n\"What does yer mean?\"\n\n\"I mean, if I git out of this place, I'll put the old man on his guard.\"\n\n\"What, an' split on me?\"\n\n\"No, I'll not mention names.\"\n\n\"Then I 'opes ye'll be sent to a 'formatory an' kep' there for the next\nfive year.\"\n\n\"Do you? Why?\"\n\n\"'Cause yer a fool, Ben Bates.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"'Cause ye are, I say.\"\n\n\"Well, your saying so don't make it so, anyhow,\" retorted Benny:\n\n\"Don't it, though? But look 'ere: ye're 'ere for stealin', and I can\ntell yer from 'sperience, that a gent as takes up the perfession is\nworse nor a fool to give it up agin 'cause he 'appens to get nabbed.\"\n\n\"But I'm not here for stealin',\" said Benny, colouring.\n\n\"Ye're not, eh?\" said Perks, laughing till the tears ran down his face.\n\"Well, that are the richest bit I's heard for the last month.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Benny, with flashing eyes, \"though I'm here charged with\nstealing, I tell yer I'm honest.\"\n\n\"Are that a fact now, Ben?\" said Perks, looking serious.\n\n\"It is,\" replied Benny; \"I never took the money.\"\n\n\"Well, so much the worse,\" said Perks.\n\n\"How's that?\"\n\n\"Cause yer might as well be a thief, hout an' hout, as be charged wi'\nbein' one. I tell 'e there's no chance for yer; the bobbies'll 'ave\ntheir eyes on yer wherever yer be; and if yer gits a sitivation they'll\ncome along an' say to yer guv'nor, 'Yon's a jail-bird, yer'd better 'ave\nyer eye on 'im;' then ye'll 'ave to walk it somewheres else, an' it'll\nbe the same everywheres.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\" said Benny.\n\n\"'Cause I's 'sperienced it,\" was the reply. \"I's older 'n you, though\nyou's biggest; but I reckons as I knows most, an' it's true what I say.\nWhy, bless yer, the first time I ever nabbed I got a month, an' I wor\nso horful frightened, that I vowed if ever I got out I'd be honest,\nan' never get in no more; but, bless yer, it wur no go. The bobbies\ntold each other who I wur, an' they was always a-watching me. I got a\nsitivation once, a honcommon good 'un too; but, oh, lor, the next day\na bobby says to the guv'nor, says he, 'Yon's a jail-bird, you'd better\nkeep yer eye on 'im;' an' you may guess I'd to walk in quick sticks.\nI made two or three tries arter, but it wur no go. As soon as hever a\nbobbie came near I'd to be off like greased lightnin', an' you'll find\nout what I say. If yer not a thief now, ye'll 'ave to come to it. I tell\nyer there's no help for it.\"\n\n\"But I tell you I'll _not_ come to it,\" said Benny, stoutly.\n\n\"But I knows better,\" persisted Perks; \"there ken be no possible chance\nfor yer. Ye're down, an' the world'll keep 'e down, though yer try ever\nso.\"\n\nBenny looked thoughtful, for he had a suspicion that a good deal that\nPerks said was true. He was down, and he feared there was very little,\nif any, chance of his getting up again. He had proved by experience that\nthe world was hard upon poor lads, and he knew it would be doubly hard\nupon him now that his character was gone. Yet he felt that he could not\nbecome a thief. He would sooner die, and he told Perks so.\n\nBut Perks only laughed at the idea.\n\n\"You'll find that dyin' ain't so precious easy, my lad,\" he said in a\npatronizing tone of voice. And Benny felt that very likely Perks' words\nwere true in relation to that matter, and so he was silent.\n\n\"You'd better come partner 'long wi' me,\" said Perks, in a tone of voice\nthat was intended to be encouraging.\n\n\"No,\" said Benny. \"I'll help you if you'll try to be honest; for look\nhere, Perks: there's another life besides this, an' if we're not good we\nshall go to the bad place when we die, for only good people can go to\nheaven. An' I want to go to the good place, for little Nell is there;\nan' I want to see her again, for she was all I had to love in the world,\nan' oh! it 'ud grieve her so if I were to be a thief, an' grieve the\ngood Lord who died for us all. No, Perks, little Nell begged me afore\nshe died to be good, an' she said the Lord 'ud provide, an' I means to\nbe good. Won't you try to be good too, Perks? I'm sure it 'ud be better.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Perks: \"folks 'as druv' me to what I is. I tried to be\nhonest once, an' they wouldn't let me, an' so I intends to stick to the\nperfession now, for I likes it; an' ye'll come to it yet.\"\n\n\"I'd rather die,\" said Benny solemnly.\n\n\"Humbug!\" snarled Perks. \"But I'll say this afore I go to sleep, for\nI's gettin' des'pert sleepy, if ye'll join me in the perfession I'll be\na frien' to yer, an' put yer up to all the tricks, an' forgive yer for\nthat hidin' yer give me. But if,\" and he brought out the words slowly,\n\"ye'll 'sist on bein' a fool, I'll pay off old scores yet, an' I'll\nplague yer worse nor ever I's done yet; so I give yer fair warnin'. Now\nfor the land o' nod.\"\n\nNeither of them spoke again after that, and soon after they were both\nlocked in the arms of kindly sleep.\n\nThe following morning Benny was again brought before the magistrates,\nbut nothing new was brought forward in evidence. Mr. Lawrence, however,\nstated that he did not wish to prosecute, or in any way punish the lad.\nAnd as there was no positive evidence that Benny had taken the money,\nhe was dismissed. It was evident, however, that the general belief was\nthat he was guilty; but as the evidence was only presumptive, and this\nbeing his first appearance before them, he was given the benefit of the\ndoubt, and set at liberty, with a caution that if he came before them\nagain he would not get off so easily.\n\nHis week's wages that Mr. Lawrence had paid him was restored to him on\nleaving the court, and once more he found himself a homeless orphan on\nthe streets of Liverpool.\n\nPerks did not fare so well. He was an old and evidently a hardened\noffender. The case was also proved against him, and he was sentenced to\nbe kept in prison for three calendar months. Perks heard the sentence\nunmoved. He liked liberty best, it is true, but the only thing that\ngrieved him was that it was summer-time. If it had been winter, he would\nnot have cared a straw; but as it was he was determined to make the best\nof it, and get as much enjoyment out of it as he possibly could.\n\nSo Perks and Benny drifted apart, and Benny wondered if they would ever\nmeet again. Life before him lay dark and cheerless. He seemed to have\ndrifted away from everything: no friend was left to him in all the\nworld. There were granny and Joe, but he could not see them, for he felt\nthat if a shade of suspicion crept into their manner, it would break\nhis heart. No, he would keep away. Then there was Mr. Lawrence; he could\nexpect nothing further from him. He believed him to be a thief, of that\nthere could be no doubt, and so doubtless did Morgan and all the other\nclerks. And then there was little Eva, the angel that had brightened\nhis life for six brief months, and whose bright shilling nothing could\ninduce him to part with. Did she believe him guilty too? Of course she\ndid. His guilt must seem so clear to every one of them. And so he was\nalone in the world, without a friend to help, unless God would help him;\nbut of that he did not feel quite sure. Sometimes he thought that the\nLord would surely provide, but at other times he doubted.\n\nHe was at liberty, it was true, and ought he not to be thankful\nfor that? he asked himself; but alas! his innocence had not been\nestablished. Young as he was, he felt the force of that. And he felt it\nterribly hard that all--all! even his little angel--believed him to be a\nthief.\n\nAh! he did not know how sore was Eva Lawrence's little heart, and how\nshe persisted to her father that Benny was innocent, and pleaded with\nhim, but pleaded in vain, for him to take back the poor boy and give him\nanother chance.\n\nAnd night after night she cried herself to sleep, as she thought of the\nlittle orphan sent adrift on life's treacherous ocean, and wondered what\nthe end would be. And when one day she tried to sing \"Love at Home,\"\nthe words almost choked her, for the pleading, suffering face of the\nhomeless child came up before her, and looked at her with hungry wistful\neyes, as if asking for sympathy and help.\n\nBut children soon forget their griefs, and as the days wore away and\nlengthened into weeks, Benny was almost forgotten, till one day a\ncircumstance occurred which made him again the talk of the Lawrence\nhousehold. What that circumstance was shall be told in its proper place\nin the unfolding of this story of Benny's life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nAdrift.\n\n  A fathomless sea is rolling\n    O'er the wreck of the bravest bark;\n  And my pain-muffled heart is tolling\n    Its dumb peal down in the dark.\n\n  The waves of a mighty sorrow\n    Have 'whelmed the pearl of my life;\n  And there cometh to me no morrow,\n   To solace this desolate strife.\n\n  Gone are the last faint flashes,\n    Set is the sun of my years;\n  And over a few poor ashes\n    I sit in my darkness and tears.\n                    --Gerald Massey.\n\n\nHad any of our readers been passing the front of St. George's Hall\nduring the afternoon of the day on which Benny was acquitted, they might\nhave seen our hero sitting on one of the many steps, with his face\nburied in his hands and his elbows resting on his knees. Hour after hour\nhe sat unmolested, for Perks was no longer at liberty to tease him, and\nthe police did not notice him.\n\nBenny was utterly unconscious of the flight of time, for he was trying\nto decide upon some course of action by which he could honestly earn his\ndaily bread. He felt that he was beginning life again, and beginning it\nunder tremendous disadvantages. He knew that there was a great deal of\ntruth in what Perks had said to him. All who knew him would mistrust\nhim, and even should he succeed in getting employment under those\nwho did not know him, they might soon get to know, and then he would\nbe dismissed. He was getting too big to be a match boy. He did not\nunderstand blacking shoes, and yet to remain idle meant starvation.\n\n\"I'm wuss nor a chap buried,\" he said to himself, thrusting his hands\ninto his trousers pockets and staring around him. \"I've heerd of chaps\nbeginnin' at the bottom, but lor a massy! I'm beginnin' furder down than\nthat by a long chalk. I'm six feet under ground, an' I'll 'ave to bore a\nhole up inter the daylight, or die, I 'specks.\"\n\nAs the afternoon wore away he became conscious of a feeling of hunger.\nFortunately, he had sufficient money to keep him from starving for a\nday or two. He counted over the coins very carefully, and laid aside\neighteenpence as being due to granny, and which he resolved should be\npaid.\n\n\"I'll begin honest,\" he said to himself, \"an' I'll keep on at it too, or\ngo to heaven to little Nell.\"\n\nSo after purchasing two sheets of paper and two envelopes, he made\nhis way to a small eating-house and ordered some bread and cheese. He\nwas not long in devouring his very simple meal, and then with a lead\npencil commenced his first attempt at letter-writing. The first letter\ncontained only a few words of warning to Jerry Starcher. The second\nletter was longer, and was addressed to granny. This letter cost Benny\na tremendous effort, for, fearing that granny would not be able to read\nwriting, he had, to use his own words, \"to print it,\" and he found it to\nbe a rather slow process. The letter was to the following effect:--\n\n\"Deer Grany,--I ken never come 'ome no more. You's heerd what's took\nplaas, but I nevver stole the money. I is 'onest, for shure I dunno wat\nI'll do or whair I'll go; but I meen to be 'onest or die. I wish I wur\nded. I is very, very, very 'bliged for ole you's don for me an' littel\nNel: tel Joe I is 'bliged to 'im to. P'r'aps I'll never see 'e no more,\np'r'aps I'll go to littel Nel soon. I 'ope I may, I's very lon-ly. I put\nwith this the money I ow's. Good nite.--Benny.\"\n\nMore than one scalding tear fell upon the letter while he wrote, for the\ntears would come despite his efforts to keep them back. Life seemed to\nhim such an utter desolation, and hope had almost died out of his heart.\n\nWhen he had carefully folded and sealed the letters, he went out again\non the steps in the shadow of the great Hall, and waited for the\ndarkness. All around him the people hurried to and fro. But had he been\nin the heart of Africa he could not have felt more utterly forsaken and\nalone.\n\nWhen at length the darkness crept over the busy town, he hurried away to\nTempest Court, passing Jerry Starcher's, and pushing the letter under\nhis door on the way. His heart beat very fast when he reached granny's\ndoor. He was strongly tempted to knock for admittance, for something\ntold him that granny would not turn him away, but he struggled against\nthe feeling. Welcome as would have been his little bed under the stairs,\nand glad as he would have been for a hiding-place from the world's\nscorn, yet he felt he would rather not see granny and Joe again while\nthis stain darkened his name.\n\nWithin the cottage silence and darkness reigned, for granny had retired\nearly to rest--not without a prayer, though, that the boy she was\nlearning to love might see the error of his ways, truly repent of his\nsin, and lead a new life. For Joe had told her what had befallen Benny,\nand furthermore had extracted from her the promise that if he should\never seek again the shelter of her home, for his little sister's sake\nand for the sake of the Saviour, she would not turn him away, but would\nhelp him to begin a better life.\n\nBenny listened for awhile at the key-hole, then cautiously pushing the\nletter under the door, he hurried away into the darkness. He had no idea\nwhere he would spend the night, nor did he concern himself about the\ndirection he was taking; he only felt that he must go somewhere. So on\nhe went in a northerly direction, passing street after street, till,\nfootsore and weary, he stumbled into a dark corner where he thought\nnobody would notice him, and soon fell fast asleep.\n\nWhy could not the policeman who passed a few minutes later, and spied\nthe little crouching figure, have permitted the child to sleep on? He\nwas doing no harm, and the policeman might have known that had the boy a\nhome to go to he would not have been found sleeping in the street.\n\nI suppose he thought nothing about the matter, for he seized Benny by\nthe collar and lifted him off the ground, and after shaking him as a\nterrier might shake a rat, he ordered him to move on, giving emphasis to\nhis words by a cruel kick, which made Benny grind his teeth with pain,\nand hurry limping down the street.\n\nHe had not gone far before a clock near him began to strike slowly the\nhour of midnight. At the first stroke of the bell Benny started, and\nlooked carefully around him. Clang went the second stroke.\n\n\"It must be the same,\" he muttered to himself.\n\nThe third stroke made him certain.\n\nHe was near Addler's Hall without knowing it. The tone of the church\nclock was as familiar to him as the voice of his father. Scores of times\nduring the years of his childhood he had listened to that clang, waking\nup the midnight silence when all the others were asleep.\n\n\"I wonder if father's comed home yet?\" he said to himself; \"I'll go and\nsee, anyhow.\"\n\nBowker's Row was as silent as the grave, and, as usual, wrapped in\ndarkness. But the darkness was no difficulty to Benny, as he made his\nway cautiously up the dingy street and into the dingier court that was\nonce his home. It seemed very strange to him that he should be there\nalone in the silent night, and that Nelly should be alone in her little\ngrave miles away from where he stood.\n\nWhat a lot had been crowded into his lonely life since last he stood in\nAddler's Hall, holding his little sister by the hand! And he wondered\nif ever Nelly left her beautiful home in the sky to pay a visit to the\ndreary haunts of her childhood.\n\nBefore him the door of his old home stood open--the night was not so\ndark but he could see that--and he could see also that the place wore\neven a more forsaken appearance than in former days.\n\nPausing for a moment on the threshold, he plunged into the darkness,\nthen stood still in the middle of the room and listened; but no sound of\nbreathing or noise of any kind broke the oppressive stillness.\n\nHe soon discovered also that the house was destitute of furniture; a few\nshavings under the stairs alone remained.\n\n\"The bobbies'll not find me 'ere, I reckon,\" he said to himself, \"though\nNelly may.\"\n\nAnd he stretched himself on the shavings in the corner where he and his\nlittle sister used to sleep in the days that had gone for ever.\n\nIt seemed so strange to be there again, and to be there in sorrow and\ndisgrace; and once or twice he stretched out his hand in the darkness as\nif expecting to find his little sister by his side. Then, as the memory\nof his loss and the loneliness of his life crept over him, he gave vent\nto his feelings in a flood of tears. By-and-bye he grew calm, and soon\nafter fell asleep; and in happy dreams, in which he wandered with Nelly\nthrough Eastham Woods, he forgot all his trouble and care.\n\nWhen he awoke the next morning the court was alive and stirring, and\nBowker's Row was crowded with ill-fed, ragged, and dirty children: some\nwere doing their best to climb the lamp-posts, some were practising\ncart-wheel revolutions, some were squatted idly on the pavement, and\nothers were playing with the refuse in the street.\n\nOn Benny making his appearance, he was greeted with a shout and a howl\nthat made the street echo again, and summoned the elders to the doorways\nto see what had happened.\n\nIt was very evident that the older children had recognized him, while\nmany a familiar face appeared at door and window. This Benny thought was\nvery unfortunate, for he was in no mood to be questioned or to brook\ndelay. So he darted down the street as if on a race for life, knocking\nover several of the older lads who tried to check his progress.\n\nFor some distance he was followed by a whole tribe of noisy urchins, who\nshouted at the top of their voices. But Benny was too fleet-footed for\nthem, and soon Bowker's Row and its noisy denizens were left far behind.\n\nBenny's first thought now was to secure a substantial breakfast, which\nwas by no means a difficult matter. That done, he made his way toward\nthe docks, in the hope that he might get employment of some kind. But to\na little friendless lad, without character or recommendation, employment\nwas not so easily obtained. Most of those whom he addressed did not\ncondescend to notice his question in any way. A few asked him what he\ncould do, and when he replied \"Anything,\" the invariable answer was,\n\"That means nothing,\" and he was sent about his business. In fact, there\nseemed to be no work in the whole line of docks that a child of his age\nwas capable of doing. And night found him worn out with fatigue, and\nwith a sadly lightened pocket.\n\nHowever, he kept up his heart as well as he could, and sought rest and\nsleep in a damp cellar upon some dirty straw, which for the payment\nof twopence he shared with a dozen other lads, who appeared to be as\nfriendless as himself. That night he slept the sleep of the innocent and\nweary, and awoke next morning, strengthened and refreshed, to find that\nall his companions had left and that his pockets were empty!\n\nThis was a terrible blow to Benny; but when he discovered that his\n\"lucky shilling\" was still safe in the lining of his waistcoat, he dried\nhis tears, and went bravely out, hungry as he was, to battle with an\nunfriendly world.\n\nBefore sunset, however, he had nearly lost heart, for he had been unable\nto earn a single penny, and he was almost faint with hunger. So in\nsheer desperation he sought his old place on the landing-stage, in the\nhope that he might have the chance of carrying some one's portmanteau,\nand in that way earn his supper; but everyone to whom he offered his\nservices repulsed him, and for the first time he wondered whether it\nwould be wrong to throw himself into the river, and whether that would\nnot be the easiest way out of his trouble. Somehow he could not help\nthinking that it would be less wicked for him to do that than to steal.\nHe could not starve; drowning he was sure would be a much less painful\ndeath; and, as far as he could see, it had really come to this, that he\nmust either steal or die. But he would not steal, he had made up his\nmind to that. Had he not promised Nelly that he would be honest? And had\nnot Joe and granny and his Sunday-school teacher told him what a wicked\nthing it was to be a thief? No; he had settled that matter, and when he\nhad settled a thing in his own mind he was not to be moved. The question\nthen was, what was the easiest kind of death? The river looked beautiful\nthis summer evening, and he thought it must be very nice to rest beneath\nits cool sparkling waters after the hot glare of the streets. Should he\nplunge in now, or should he wait a little longer? He had been without\nfood for twenty-four hours. He had no place to sleep, no means of\ngetting supper.\n\nThen suddenly he remembered his \"lucky shilling.\"\n\n\"Queer!\" he mused. \"The Lord sent His angel wi' this bob, an' I've never\nwanted it till now, an' now I does want it, I've got it. I'm floored\nagain. Nelly said the Lord 'ud provide, and He do.\" And he took out the\nbright shilling and looked at it fondly.\n\nJust then he heard a countryman inquiring the way to Lime Street\nStation, of a man who stood near him.\n\n\"Here's a chance,\" he thought; and, stepping forward, he said, \"I'll\nshow you the way, sir, if yer likes.\"\n\n\"Dost thee know th' way thysel', lad?\" inquired the man.\n\n\"I should think I do,\" said Benny, drawing himself up to his full height.\n\n\"Lead the way, then,\" said the farmer; and Benny trotted on before him,\nfeeling sure that he was safe now for a good supper without spending his\nshilling.\n\n\"Thankee,\" said the farmer, on their arrival at the station; \"thee'rt a\nsharp lad, an' no mistake.\"\n\nAnd he smiled benevolently, and hurried away to the booking-office,\nleaving our hero staring after him in utter bewilderment.\n\nBenny felt that he would have liked to have had his revenge on that man\nthen and there.\n\n\"Golly,\" he said, \"don't I feel savage, just!\"\n\nJust then a gentleman pushed against him, carrying a bulky leathern bag.\n\n\"Carry yer bag, sir?\" said Benny in an instant; and, without a word, the\nbag was hoisted on his shoulder, and once more Benny was on the trot.\n\nBy the time he had reached the top of Brownlow Hill he was almost\nexhausted, and without a word the man (gentleman, I suppose he thought\nhimself) took the bag from his shoulder and handed him a penny in\npayment for his services.\n\nWhen will men, and professedly Christian men, learn the great though\nsimple lesson--to do unto others as they would that others should do\nunto them?\n\nA benevolent baker, moved to pity by the sight of Benny's suffering\nface, gave him a twopenny loaf for his penny, with a smile and a kindly\nword into the bargain, and Benny went out into the darkening street with\na lighter heart than he had felt for the day.\n\nThe evening was oppressively warm, and having no inclination to go back\nagain into the dingy town, where policemen were plentiful, Benny made\nhis way in an easterly direction, hoping that he might find a dark\ncorner somewhere where he might sleep undisturbed.\n\nAfter a while he found himself in the neighbourhood of the cemetery\nwhere Nelly was buried. He was not superstitious, so without a moment's\nhesitation he climbed over the wall, and, getting dark as it was, he\neasily found his sister's grave; and, stretching himself on the damp\ngrass, with his head upon the little mound under which his Nelly slept\nin peace, he tried to think--to form some plan for the future.\n\nAbove him twinkled the silent stars. Around him slept the silent dead.\nEverything was silent; not a leaf stirred, not even a blade of grass;\nand yielding to the silent influence of the hour, he fell asleep,\nthough not before he had resolved that he would return to his old haunts\nno more, but would commence his new life as far away from Liverpool as\nhe could possibly get.\n\nNext morning he was up with the lark, and kissing the sod above his\nsister's face, he hurried away. At noon Liverpool was several miles\nbehind him, and before him--what?\n\nUnder the shadow of a tree by the roadside he rested for an hour during\nthe heat of the day, and in a clear stream that babbled by he slaked\nhis thirst and washed the dust from his hands and face, then hurried on\nagain.\n\nThe country looked very beautiful bathed in the summer's sunshine, but\nhe was in no mood to enjoy it. The birds sang their glad songs in the\ntrees, but to him they seemed only to mock his sorrow. In the fields\nhe saw the sleek cattle grazing as he passed, or lying in the sunshine\ncontentedly chewing their cud, while he was footsore, hungry, and sad,\nand he wondered what the end of it all would be.\n\nAs the afternoon wore away he found himself hedged in with plantations\non every side, and not a single human habitation in sight.\n\nFor awhile he dragged himself along with fast failing courage and\nstrength; then he gave up in despair.\n\n\"It's no go,\" he said; \"I ken go no furder.\"\n\nHis feet were hot and blistered with his long tramp over the hard and\ndusty road. His head ached from the fierce heat that had been beating\ndown on him all the day, his strength was all but gone, for he had\ntasted no food since the previous evening.\n\n\"I dunno how the Lord's goin' to do it,\" he said, the tears starting in\nhis eyes. \"Nelly said as how the Lord 'ud provide, an' so did the angel\nthat gived me the bob; but I dunna see how. I wonder if He's goin' to\ntake me to heaven? P'r'aps that's the way He's goin' to do it, an' then\nI'll never be 'ungry no more.\"\n\nClimbing on a gate, he looked around him, but no house was anywhere\nvisible.\n\n\"It's all up, I reckon,\" he said sadly, getting down on the inside and\nmaking his way through the tangled undergrowth into the heart of the\nplantation. \"I'll find a snug place 'ere somewheres, where I ken wait\ntill the Lord comes. I wonder if He'll be long?\"\n\nHe had not gone far before he found a place that suited him. A luxuriant\npatch of ferns growing out of a carpet of moss, bordered on every side\nwith tall brushwood, while overhead giant fir-trees sighed and moaned in\nthe evening breeze, made a perfect arbour of quiet and repose. Pressing\ndown the yielding ferns, he had soon a bed soft as he could desire,\nwhile a mossy bank made a pillow grateful as a kiss of love to his\naching head and burning cheek.\n\n\"I'll be comfortable 'ere till the Lord comes,\" he said, stretching out\nhis weary limbs. \"I wonder if He'll bring Nelly wi' Him?\"\n\nThen he closed his eyes and waited. Above him the fir-branches swayed\ngently in the soft evening breeze, and from far away came the subdued\nplash of falling water. It was very strange and solemn, but soothing and\nrestful withal.\n\nThe pangs of hunger abated, too, after he had rested awhile, and his\nhead ceased to ache, while the wind in the trees sounded like an evening\nlullaby, and brought back to him a vague and misty recollection of his\nmother rocking him to sleep on her lap, in the years long, long ago.\n\nThen the music seemed to come from farther and farther away, till it\nceased altogether, and once more Benny slept. And there in the solemn\nwood we will leave him for awhile to the mercy and care that are\ninfinite.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nThe Border Land.\n\n  For since Thy hand hath led me here,\n    And I have seen the border land,--\n  Seen the dark river flowing near,\n    Stood on its bank as now I stand,--\n  There has been nothing to alarm\n    My trembling soul; why should I fear?\n  For since encircled by Thy arm,\n    I never felt Thee half so near.\n\n\nJoe Wrag was in great trouble when he heard of Benny's misfortune.\nGranny was the first to make him acquainted with the fact that something\nwas wrong. Benny had been in the habit of returning earlier on a\nSaturday evening since he had been with Mr. Lawrence than on any other\nday of the week, and when that evening wore away and deepened into\nnight, and Benny did not come, granny got very much concerned, fearing\nsome accident had befallen him; and so she remained rocking herself in\nher chair, and listening in vain for his footfall all through the night.\nAnd when morning came she hurried away, old as she was, to Joe's house,\nin the hope that he would be able to give her some information as to\nBenny's whereabouts.\n\nJoe was thunderstruck at sight of Betty so early on a Sunday morning,\nand her eager question, \"Dost a' knaw where the boy is, Joe?\" did not\nhelp to mend matters. For a few moments Joe's power of utterance seemed\nto have left him altogether, then he stammered forth--\n\n\"Ain't he hum, Betty?\"\n\n\"Nae, Joe; I's never seen 'im sin yester morn!\"\n\nJoe looked thoughtful, for he had no reply to this, and Betty sat down\nin a chair, evidently exhausted.\n\nAfter a while Betty got up to go. \"I mun be a-goin',\" she said, \"he may\na-got hum by now.\"\n\nTowards evening Joe called at Tempest Court, but nothing had been heard\nof the wanderer. The night that followed was one of the longest Joe had\never known, and as soon as he was released from his watch in the morning\nhe went at once to Mr. Lawrence's office.\n\n\"Is the maaster in?\" he said, addressing one of the clerks.\n\n\"No, my good man,\" was the reply; \"he will not be down for an hour yet.\nCould you call again?\"\n\n\"Mebbe you'll do as weel,\" said Joe, scratching his head. \"Can yer tell\nme wot's become o' the boy Benny?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said the clerk, smiling complacently, \"he's where he ought to\nhave been long ago.\"\n\n\"Where's that?\" said Joe.\n\n\"In prison, sir!\"\n\n\"In prison?\" in a tone of bewilderment.\n\n\"Even so,\" with a bland smile.\n\n\"I can't say as 'ow I hunderstand,\" Joe stammered out.\n\n\"Very likely,\" said the clerk, \"so I will inform you that Mr. Lawrence,\nhaving his suspicions aroused, placed a five-pound note on his desk, and\nthen set a watch----\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Joe, eager yet fearing to hear the rest.\n\n\"Well,\" continued the clerk, \"this young friend of yours, who seems to\nhave been an old hand at the work, was seen coolly to take the money.\nBut when charged with the theft, a few minutes after, he stoutly denied\nall knowledge of the circumstance; but Mr. Lawrence was determined to\nstand no nonsense, and had him at once marched off to the lock-up.\"\n\nFor a moment Joe looked at the clerk in silence, then, without a word,\nwalked out of the office. When he told granny, she was at first\nindignant. \"To think that she, a honest woman, 'ad been a-'arbouring a\nthief all these months!\" But Joe soon talked her into a better frame of\nmind, and it was then that she promised him that if the prodigal ever\ncame back again she would not turn him away.\n\nWhen Joe read in the paper on Wednesday morning that Benny was\nacquitted, his delight knew no bounds. He accepted the fact as almost\nproof positive that Benny was innocent, and went at once to tell granny\nthe news.\n\nHe found the old woman crying over Benny's letter, with the\neighteenpence lying in her lap. When Joe came in she handed him the\nletter without a word. Joe blew his nose violently several times during\nits perusal, then laid it down on the table, and walked to the door to\nhide his emotion. It was several moments before he could command himself\nsufficiently to speak, then he blurted out--\n\n\"The poor parsecuted bairn mun be found somehow, Betty, an' 'ere's off\nto sairch. Good mornin', Betty.\"\n\nAnd before the old woman could reply he was gone.\n\nDuring the next three days Joe had but little sleep. He tramped the town\nin every direction, in the hope that he might glean some tidings of the\npoor lost lad; but his labour was in vain, and each evening when he\nreturned to his hut it was with a sadly diminished hope of ever finding\nthe boy again.\n\nOn the evening that Benny, hungry and forsaken, lay down in the wood to\nsleep, Joe felt his heart drawn out in prayer in such a manner as he\nhad never before experienced. Nearly the whole of the night he spent\nupon his knees. Now and then he got up and walked out into the silent\nstreet, and gazed for a few moments up into the starlit sky. Then he\nwould return to his hut again and pray more fervently than ever. He had\nreturned from his search that evening utterly cast down, feeling that\nthe only resource left to him was prayer. He knew not whether the boy\nwas living or dead. He could hardly think the latter; and yet if he were\nalive, who could tell what he was suffering? Who but God? To God then he\nwould go and plead for the outcast boy, and who should tell whether God\nmight not regard his prayer and send help and deliverance to the child?\nThus hour after hour he prayed on, and when the light of the morning\ncrept up into the eastern sky, he rose from his knees comforted.\n\nWere Joe Wrag's prayers answered? No doubt they were. Not in the way,\nperhaps, that Joe would have liked best, and yet in the best way for all\nthat. God does not always give us in answer to our prayers what _we_\nthink best, but what _He_ thinks best. To weary, worn-out Benny God gave\nsleep, deep, dreamless, and refreshing, and in the morning he awoke\nto the song of birds and to the rustle of a thousand leaves. The music\nsounded very sweet to Benny's ears, but it was not the music of heaven,\nas he had hoped it would be. He had waited there in the solemn wood for\nthe coming of the Lord, but He had not come. Heaven seemed farther away\nfrom him than ever this morning, and earth was painfully real. He felt\nhimself too weak to stir at first, so he lay still, occasionally opening\nhis eyes to watch the slanting sunbeams play among the tangled foliage,\nand light up the dewdrops that trembled on every leaf.\n\nHis head was hot and heavy, and his eyes ached when he kept them open\nlong, and the pangs of hunger were coming on again. What should he do?\nHe lay for a long time trying to think, but his thoughts whirled and\ntwisted like snowflakes in a storm.\n\n\"P'raps I kin get on a little furder if I tries,\" he said to himself at\nlength, and suiting the action to the words, he rose from his ferny bed\nand staggered out of the wood. He had scarcely strength left to get over\nthe gate, but he managed it at length, and then fell down exhausted by\nthe roadside.\n\nHow long he lay there he never knew; but he was aroused at length by the\nlumbering of some kind of vehicle coming towards him along the road, and\nby the shrill whistling of the driver.\n\nNearer and nearer came the vehicle, and then stopped just opposite him.\nBenny looked up and saw a shock-headed, overgrown lad, standing in what\nseemed an empty cart, staring at him with a look of wonder in his great\nround eyes.\n\nBenny had reached a stage of exhaustion which made him indifferent to\nalmost everything, so he only blinked at the boy, and then dropped his\nhead again on the grass.\n\n\"Art a tired?\" said the boy at length.\n\n\"Ay,\" said Benny, without opening his eyes.\n\n\"Wilt a 'ave a lift?\"\n\n\"What's a lift?\"\n\n\"A ride, then, if it's properer.\"\n\n\"Ay, I'll ride; but 'ow's I to get in?\"\n\n\"Oh, aisy 'nough,\" said young Giles, jumping out of the cart and lifting\nBenny in as if he had been an infant.\n\n\"Golly,\" said Benny, coming out with his once favourite expression,\n\"you're mighty strong!\"\n\n\"Strong? You should see me lift a bag o' corn! Now, Dobbin,\" to the\nhorse. \"Gee, meth-a-way,\" and the horse moved on at what seemed a\nstereotyped pace.\n\n\"'Ave a turmut?\" said the boy at length.\n\n\"What's a turmut?\"\n\n\"Lor, now,\" laughed the boy, \"you must be green not to know what a\nturmut is.\" And he untied the mouth of one of several bags lying at\nthe bottom of the cart, and took out two, and by the aid of a large\nclasp-knife had both peeled in a \"jiffey.\"\n\nPutting his teeth into one, he handed the other to Benny, who readily\nfollowed his example, and thought he had never tasted anything more\ndelicious.\n\nBy the time our hero had finished his turnip they had reached a small\nvillage, and Benny was able to get out of the cart unaided. Here were\nhouses at last. Perhaps he might get work here; he would try, at any\nrate. And try he did; but it was discouraging work.\n\nAt many of the houses the door was slammed in his face in answer to his\ninquiry. At a few places the person addressed condescended to ask Benny\nwhere he came from, and when he replied \"from Liverpool,\" he was told to\nbe off about his business, as \"they wanted no thieves nor pickpockets in\ntheir employ.\"\n\nOne kind-looking old gentleman asked Benny what he could do.\n\n\"Anything a'most,\" was the prompt reply.\n\n\"You're too clever by a long way,\" laughed the old man; \"but let's\nperticlerize a bit. Can you spud thistles?\"\n\nBenny looked bewildered. He knew nothing about \"spuds\" or \"thistles,\" so\nhe shook his head in reply.\n\n\"Canst a whet a scythe?\"\n\nAnother shake of the head.\n\n\"Take out arter the mowers?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Dibbel tates?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Humph. Canst a milk?\"\n\n\"I ken drink it, if that's wot you mean,\" said Benny.\n\n\"Ha! ha! Mary,\" raising his voice, \"fotch the lad a mug o' milk.\" And in\na few moments a stout red-armed girl brought Benny a pint mug, brimful\nof rich new milk.\n\n\"Ay, ay,\" said the old man, \"I see thee canst do thy part in that\ndirection weel eno'. Have another?\"\n\n\"No, thank you.\"\n\n\"Humph. I fear thee'rt no 'count in the country, lad.\"\n\n\"But I could larn,\" said Benny.\n\n\"Yes, yes, that's true; thee'rt a sharp boy. I shouldn't wonder if thee\ncouldn't get a job at t' next village.\"\n\n\"How far?\" said Benny.\n\n\"Short o' two mile, I should say.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" And once more Benny set off on the tramp. It was scarcely\nnoon, and the day was melting hot. Outside the village the sun's rays\nbeat down pitilessly on his head, and made him feel sick and giddy. All\nthe trees were on the wrong side of the road, and he looked in vain for\na shady spot along the dusty highway. Still on he tramped, with fast\nfailing strength. A little way before him he saw a farmhouse, with trees\ngrowing around it. \"If I can only reach that,\" he thought, \"I'll rest\nawhile.\" Nearer and nearer, but how strangely everything was swimming\naround him, and what a curious mist was gathering before his eyes!\n\nAh, there is the sound of voices; a group of haymakers just inside the\ngate getting their dinner in the shadow of a tree. Was help at hand? He\ndid not know. Gathering up all his strength, he staggered towards them,\nstretched out his hand blindly, for the mist had deepened before his\neyes, then lifted his hands to his temples, as if struck with sudden\npain, reeled, and fell senseless to the ground.\n\nIn a moment a woman raised him from the ground, and supported his head\nagainst her knee, while the men crowded round with wondering faces.\nThen Farmer Fisher came up with the question, \"What's to do?\" and the\nhaymakers stood aside, that he might see for himself.\n\n\"The boy's dead,\" said the farmer, with just a little shake in his voice.\n\n\"No,\" said the woman, \"he's not dead, his heart beats still.\"\n\n\"Go and call the missus, then, quick.\"\n\nThen one of the men started for the farmhouse.\n\nMrs. Fisher was a gentle, kind-hearted woman at all times, especially\nto children, and just now she was particularly so, for a month had not\nelapsed since she had laid one of her own children, a boy of about\nBenny's age, in the silent grave. And when she caught sight of Benny's\nwhite suffering face, her heart went out to him instantly.\n\n\"Take him into the house, John,\" she said to her husband, the tears\nstarting in her eyes, \"and send for the doctor at once.\"\n\nSo without further ado Benny was carried into the house, stripped of\nhis dirty and ragged attire, put into a warm bath, and then laid gently\nin a clean soft bed, in a cool pleasant room. Once only he opened his\neyes, looked around him with a bewildered air, then relapsed again into\nunconsciousness.\n\nThe doctor, who arrived toward evening, pronounced it a very bad case,\nordered port wine to be poured down his throat in small quantities\nduring the night, and promised to call again next day.\n\n\"Will he live?\" was Mrs. Fisher's anxious question.\n\n\"Fear not,\" said the doctor: \"want, exposure, and I fear also sunstroke,\nhave done their work. Whoever the little fellow belongs to, he's had a\nhard time of it, and to such death should not be unwelcome.\"\n\nDuring the next day Benny was conscious at brief intervals, but he lay\nso perfectly still, with half-closed eyes, that they hardly knew at\ntimes whether he was alive or dead. His face was as white as the pillow\non which he lay, and his breathing all but imperceptible. The doctor\nshook his head when he came, but held out no hope of recovery.\n\nSo that summer Sabbath passed away, and Monday came and went, and\nTuesday followed in the track, and Wednesday dawned, and still Benny's\nlife trembled in the balance. The doctor said there was no perceptible\nincrease of strength, while the pulse, if anything, was weaker. Hence,\nwithout some great change, he thought the boy would not live many hours\nlonger.\n\nOutside the birds twittered in the trees, and the songs of the haymakers\nfloated on the still summer air; but within, in a darkened room, little\nBenny to all appearance lay dying. He had reached the border land, and\nwas standing on the river's brink. On the other side of the stream\nwas the everlasting home, where his Nelly dwelt, and where hunger and\nweariness and pain could never come. Why did he linger, when he wanted\nso much to cross and be at rest for ever?\n\nHe had no fear, and to the onlookers it seemed easy dying. No sigh or\nmoan escaped his lips; he lay as still as the dead.\n\nThe day waned at length and darkened into night, and Mrs. Fisher and\none of the servants remained up to watch by the little invalid. It was\nabout midnight when they observed a change come over him. The brow\ncontracted as if in pain, the wasted fingers plucked at the clothes, and\nthe breathing became heavy and irregular.\n\nMrs. Fisher ran to her husband's room and summoned him at once to\nBenny's bedside. John Fisher was a kind man, and needed no second\nbidding. With gentle hand he wiped away the big drops that were\ngathering on the little sufferer's brow; then turning to his wife, he\nsaid,\n\n\"Do you think you had better stay, love? I think he is dying.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" she said, \"I cannot see him die.\" Then, after a pause, she\nsobbed, \"Let me know when it is over, John,\" and hurried from the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nLife at the Farm.\n\n  Source of my life's refreshing springs,\n    Whose presence in my heart sustains me,\n  Thy love appoints me pleasant things,\n    Thy mercy orders all that pains me.\n\n  Well may Thine own beloved, who see\n    In all their lot their Father's pleasure,\n  Bear loss of all they love, save Thee--\n    Their living, everlasting treasure.\n                            --Waring.\n\n\nMrs. Fisher waited anxiously in an adjoining room for the coming of her\nhusband to tell her that Benny was no more. She could not go back into\nthe sick-room, she dared not see the child die. It was only such a short\ntime ago she held her own dying Rob in her arms while he gasped out his\nlittle life, and the wound in her heart was not healed yet: she fancied\nit never would be. The sick child in the next room, that she had taken\nto her heart, had opened it afresh, and she felt that to see the little\nfellow struggling in the agonies of death would be more than her nerves\ncould bear. And so she waited while the moments dragged slowly along.\n\n\"How tenaciously the child clings to life!\" she said to herself as she\npaced restlessly up and down the room. Still her husband came not.\n\n\"Can he be fighting death all this while?\" she said; \"I hope the\nlittle spirit will be released soon.\" Then she fell upon her knees and\nprayed--prayed long and earnestly that, if it were the Lord's will, the\nboy that had been thrown upon their care might have speedy and sweet\nrelease from the burden of the flesh.\n\nIt seemed long since she had left the sick-room, and still the moments\ntravelled slowly on.\n\n\"It cannot be much longer,\" she said; then a step on the landing made\nher look up anxiously, and her husband came quickly into the room.\n\n\"Come this way, Mary,\" he said, without waiting for her to speak.\n\n\"Is it all over?\" she questioned, looking up into his face.\n\n\"No, I can't understand it at all: the lad seems better, though he's\nevidently wrong in his head.\"\n\nWithout further remark, she went at once to the bedside, and laid her\nhand gently upon his forehead. Benny opened his eyes slowly, and raised\nthem to her face, then tried to speak, but only a faint whisper escaped\nhis lips.\n\n\"What do you say, poor boy?\" said Mrs. Fisher kindly, bending down her\near to listen.\n\n\"May I see Nelly, please?\" he whispered.\n\n\"Who is Nelly?\" she replied.\n\n\"Nelly is my sister; may I not see her?\" in the same faint whisper.\n\n\"Where is your sister, my boy?\" said Mrs. Fisher, looking a little\nperplexed.\n\n\"Nelly's in heaven,\" he said. \"This is heaven, ain't it?\"\n\n\"No, my boy, this is not heaven,\" she replied.\n\n\"Oh, I thought it wur,\" he said, closing his eyes with a look of pain.\nAnd Mrs. Fisher's eyes became moist, as she saw the big tears stealing\nout under the lashes, and rolling slowly down the pale wasted cheeks.\n\nAfter a while Benny fell into a sound sleep, from which he did not awake\ntill morning. When the doctor came next day he rubbed his hands with\nglee.\n\n\"Never had but one case before to equal it!\" he said, \"but it's\nwonderful what children will pull through: just as you think they are\ngoing right over the precipice, they turn round, and coolly walk back\ninto health.\"\n\n\"Do you think he will get better?\" said Mrs. Fisher.\n\n\"More likely than not,\" was the reply: \"the tide has turned, evidently.\nHe had reached the crisis when you thought he was dying last night, and\ninstead of kicking the beam, why, here he is ever so much better.\"\n\nFrom that day Benny got better. Not rapidly; no, it was a slow coming\nback to health; still, he did get better. Day by day he gathered\nstrength, though scarcely perceptible at times. The doctor rather\nwondered at this, for he expected his recovery to be much more rapid.\nBut the secret lay in the fact that Benny did not want to get better.\nAnd one day, about a week after the time of which we have spoken, he\npositively refused to take his medicine.\n\n\"But it is to make you better,\" said Mrs. Fisher gently.\n\n\"But I dunna want to get better,\" said Benny; \"I wants to go to heaven.\"\n\n\"But you should be willing to wait the Lord's time, Benny.\"\n\n\"I's waited so long,\" he said fretfully, \"that I's tired of waitin'.\"\n\n\"But it's wrong to murmur at what is God's will, Benny.\"\n\n\"Are it?\" he said. \"I didn't know, but I's very tired.\"\n\n\"But you'll get rested after a while, if you'll be patient.\"\n\n\"Ah, then,\" he said, with a sigh, \"I mun try, I s'pose.\"\n\nBut in spite of Benny's anxiety to die, health and strength came back to\nhim day by day, and one beautiful July Sabbath afternoon he was dressed,\nfor the first time, in a suit of dead Rob's clothes, and carried into\nanother room, and placed in an easy chair by the window, that he might\nfeast his eyes on the beautiful landscape that stretched out before\nhim. Benny submitted to the process without speaking a word, for he was\nstill very weak; but after he had recovered himself a little, he looked\ncuriously at the clothes in which he was enveloped, as if not at all\ncertain of his identity.\n\n\"I reckon I's not Benny Bates,\" he said at length.\n\n\"Oh, yes, you are,\" said Mrs. Fisher, who had been watching him with an\namused smile upon her face.\n\n\"Then,\" he said, looking up, \"these is not my togs.\"\n\n\"No; but I think I'll give them to you, Benny.\"\n\n\"Whew!\" lifting his eyebrows. Then he began to search carefully all the\npockets; that done, he lifted his white scared face to Mrs. Fisher, and\nsaid,\n\n\"Where's the bob, please?\"\n\n\"Where's what?\"\n\n\"The shillin'.\"\n\n\"What shilling?\"\n\n\"The one the angel gived me. Ain't yer seen it?\"\n\n\"No; where was it?\"\n\n\"In the linin' of my wesket.\"\n\n\"Oh, then, perhaps we can find it.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, do, please; I wouldna lose that bob for a hunderd poun'.\"\n\n\"A hundred pounds is a lot of money, Benny.\"\n\n\"Don't care; don't you see? an angel gived it to me.\"\n\n\"An angel, Benny?\"\n\n\"Ay, an angel, a real one; but if you'll find the bob, I'll tell yer all\n'bout it.\"\n\nAfter some searching the shilling was found, and Benny, as good as his\nword, told Mrs. Fisher the story connected with it. In fact, he would,\nnow that the ice was broken, have told that day all the story of his\nlife, but Mrs. Fisher insisted that it would tire him too much, and that\nshe would hear it some other day.\n\nSo day after day as he sat by the window, with the soft summer breeze\nfanning his brow, and with the songs of the birds in his ears, he\ntold the story that we have written. Told of his father's cruelty, of\nJoe Wrag's friendship, and of his sister's love--told of his sorrow\nand loss, his hunger and despair, and of the angel that came to him\nin his hour of need--told of his success in Mr. Lawrence's office,\nof his thirst for knowledge, and of the bright hopes he cherished\nfor the future. And he told her, too, of the charge of theft, of\nhis imprisonment and temptation, of his release and resolve, of his\nfierce battle with hunger and want; and how, to be out of the reach of\ntemptation, he had wandered away into the country until, worn out with\nhunger and fatigue, he lay down to die.\n\nAnd while Mrs. Fisher listened, she felt thankful that she had been able\nto befriend the homeless boy. Benny was winning his way to her motherly\nheart in a wonderful manner, and was helping to fill the gap caused by\nthe death of little Rob. And could she have had her own way, she would\nhave adopted him as her own, and sent him to school when he was strong\nenough, with Harry and George. But Benny's independent spirit would not\nhear of it. He would stay at Scout Farm if he might be permitted to earn\nhis own living; but if they could not find employment for him he must\ngo out into the great world once more, and try over again to earn, by\nsome means, his daily bread. So it was settled at length that he should\nstay, and learn to be a farmer; and then Benny grew strong rapidly, and\nere the sunny September days passed away, he was out in the breezy\nfields helping to gather in the late harvest, and trying to make himself\nuseful in every possible way. He was willing, nay, anxious to learn, and\nthe work was by no means difficult. For the first few weeks he was very\ntired when evening came, but the fresh air gave him an appetite, and the\nwork developed his muscles, and life once more became to him a joy.\n\nHe very soon got to know what to do without being told. He would tie up\nthe cattle in the evening as if he had been used to a farm all his life;\ngroom the horses as if he and they were old acquaintances; and feed the\ncalves with all the dispatch of an old hand at the work. Mr. Fisher was\ndelighted with him; \"a handier little chap,\" he declared, \"he had never\ncome across.\" And instead of being in the way, as Mrs. Fisher feared he\nwould be, he soon made himself necessary to them.\n\nWhen winter came, with its long dreary evenings, he found a new source\nof pleasure, and that was a night school. It was Mrs. Fisher--to whom he\nhad spoken of his thirst for knowledge--that persuaded him to attend.\nShe knew he would not only derive pleasure, but profit. Benny was\nconsiderably puzzled at first as to what a \"night school\" was like; but\nhe soon discovered its purpose, and night after night, through wind and\nrain, he plodded along the dark country lane to the neighbouring village\nof Scoutleigh, eager to improve his mind and add to his small store of\nknowledge. Never had a village schoolmaster a more diligent pupil than\nhe, and rarely one that improved more rapidly.\n\nNor did he forget in the summer that followed what he had learnt during\nthe winter. There were books in Mr. Fisher's house, to which he had\nfree access, for though on the farm he worked side by side with the\nhired servants, in the house he was treated as one of the family; and\nwhen the day's work was done, he found in his books his most congenial\ncompanions. And so he grew in body and mind, and thanked God in his\nheart for the haven he had found at last.\n\nTime passed quickly at Scout Farm. There was always so much to be done\nthat he had little time to brood over the past, or sigh over \"what might\nhave been.\" Occasionally he longed for the busy life of the town he had\nleft, but the feeling was only momentary. On the whole he was pleased\nwith the life he was living, and though he saw no prospect of ever\nrealizing the dreams that once he cherished, yet he tried to be content.\nSo the weeks passed away, and lengthened into months, and the months\nlengthened into years, almost unconsciously to Benny. He found himself\ngrowing into a man almost against his will.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSix years passed away, and Benny had grown almost out of recognition. No\none would have thought that the tall, handsome young fellow that did\nso large a share of the work at Scout Farm, was the pale and famished\nchild that dragged himself along the dusty highway six years before. He\nused to laugh sometimes when reminded of the past, and say that he was\nan example of what hard work, fresh air, and good food could accomplish.\nMr. Fisher was almost as proud of him as if he had been his own son,\nand never seemed tired of declaring that \"Ben Bates could swing a\nscythe, shear a sheep, plough a furrow, build a corn-stack, or thatch a\nhay-rick equal to any man for ten miles round.\" Nor was John Fisher the\nonly man that sang Benny's praises. The superintendent of the Methodist\nSunday-school at Scoutleigh averred that Benny was the most punctual,\ndiligent, and successful teacher he had.\n\nBenny always declared, however, that he learnt more than he ever taught.\nUp to the time that he commenced to teach, he had looked upon religion\nas stern, cold duty, and as that only; a question simply of doing or not\ndoing. It is true that he heard occasionally sermons on the subject of\nexperimental religion, but he thought it was only a way the preachers\nhad of expressing themselves. He had no doubt that he was a Christian.\nHe had been trying to be one ever since the death of his little Nell;\nhe said his prayers regularly, and always tried to do his duty; and\nhe asked himself what more could he do. Yet as he studied the New\nTestament carefully week by week, in order that he might instruct his\nclass of boys, he became slowly conscious of the fact that feelings and\nexperiences were hinted at in that Book of books that he was a stranger\nto. What did he know about that \"peace that passeth understanding,\" or\nof \"rejoicing with joy unspeakable\"? Was his life \"hid with Christ in\nGod,\" and was he certain what was meant by \"holding communion with God\nand fellowship with Christ\"? He now began to pay more attention to the\nsermons that were preached, and to the hymns that were sung. One Sunday\nmorning he stopped singing at the verse,\n\n \"Jesus, Thine all-victorious love\n    Shed in my heart abroad,\n  Then shall my feet no longer rove,\n    Rooted and fixed in God.\"\n\n\"What did it mean?\" he asked himself, \"this love shed abroad in the\nheart, inspiring the life, beautifying the character? Was religion as\nmuch a matter of love as of duty?\" He heard nothing of the lesson that\nwas read; but when the congregation stood up to sing again he was all\nattention. Slowly the words rang out, and filled the little sanctuary,\n\n \"Give me the faith which can remove\n    And sink the mountain to a plain;\n  Give me the child-like praying love\n    Which longs to build Thy house again;\n  Thy love, let it my heart o'erpower,\n    And all my simple soul devour.\n\n \"Enlarge, inflame, and fill my heart\n    With boundless charity divine!\n  So shall I all my strength exert,\n    And love them with a zeal like Thine\n  And lead them to Thy open side,\n    The sheep for whom the Shepherd died.\"\n\nThat hymn for the rest of the day became the burden of his prayer, and\nfor many days after, though when the answer came, or how, Benny never\nknew. That it did come he had no doubt, for he discovered that religion\nwas no longer the cold formal thing he had once imagined it to be, but a\nwarm living something that filled his whole life. Duty now became a joy,\nbecause love inspired it. Loving God, he loved His service and loved His\npeople; and at last he understood the words of the Master, \"My meat is\nto do the will of Him that sent Me, and to finish His work.\"\n\nI do not know that any one saw any change in Benny's life, except\nperhaps the superintendent of the school. He taught from henceforth\nas if his whole heart and soul were in the work; duty was no longer\nirksome, but a delight, and when some of the boys of his class were\nraised to a higher one, he went out into the village and got other\nboys to take their places. Thus in earnest Christian work he spent his\nSabbath days; and on the Monday morning he would start out into the\nfields with a light heart, feeling all the happier and stronger for\ndoing the Master's work on the previous day.\n\nFor many months nothing had happened to disturb the quiet and peaceful\nlives that were lived at Scout Farm. Harry and George were at college,\none studying to be a doctor, the other to be a solicitor. Winnie,\nthe baby--born since Benny came to the farm--had grown into a bonny\nlittle creature, the pet of all the household; and Mr. and Mrs. Fisher\nwere as contented with their lot as two people could be, and wanted\nno change of any kind. Benny was a little restless at times, but on\nthe whole was happy. But this quiet life could not be lived always,\nand soon afterwards a circumstance transpired which was destined to\naffect Benny's future in a way that he had no conception of. What that\ncircumstance was shall be told in another chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nAn Accident.\n\n  The sea of fortune doth not ever flow,\n    She draws her favours to the lowest ebb\n  Her tides have equal time to come and go,\n    Her loom doth weave the fine and coarsest web\n  No joy so great, but runneth to an end,\n  No hap so hard but may in time amend.\n                                --Southwell.\n\n\nNot far from Scout Farm were several gentlemen's residences, occupied\nchiefly by Manchester merchants, who travelled to and from the city\nmorning and evening by rail. One of the largest of these residences, and\nalso the farthest away from Scoutleigh Road Station, was occupied by a\nMr. Munroe, who was reputed to be a man of great wealth, and also of\ngreat liberality. In consequence of the distance of Mr. Munroe's house\nfrom the station, his coachman used to drive him to Scoutleigh Road in\nthe morning and fetch him in the evening, sometimes taking Mrs. Munroe,\nor one of the children, at the same time.\n\nMrs. Munroe was the only sister of Mr. Lawrence, of Liverpool, Benny's\nformer master, and, at the time to which we refer, Eva Lawrence was\nspending a few weeks at Brooklands with her uncle and aunt. Little did\nour hero think, as he sometimes looked across the valley at Mr. Munroe's\nhouse, almost hidden by trees, that his \"angel\" was staying there. It\nwas doubtless well for him that he did not know. He would have been\nimpatient to look once more upon the face of the maiden that, next to\nhis sister Nelly, had been the brightest vision of his life. He still\nkept the shilling that she had given him, and often when alone he would\ntake it out of his purse and look at it, and wonder what had become\nof the little girl that befriended him in his hour of need, and would\nalmost long for one more sight of her angel face.\n\nIt was at such times as these that Benny grew restless, and pined\nfor the bustle of Liverpool streets, and for the sight of old faces,\nthat day by day were fading from his memory. Yet he never seriously\nentertained the idea of going back. There were only Joe and granny, and\nMr. Lawrence and Eva, that he cared to see, but that they would care to\nsee him was very doubtful, and he could not go back to be looked at with\nsuspicion. And not only so: he believed that he was where God intended\nhim to be. He had a home, and a good one, among friends who believed in\nhis honesty, and treated him with kindness. And even yet, had he been\ndisposed to pay a visit to his old haunts, he had no time. He was fully\nemployed every day of the week, and every season of the year brought its\nappointed work. The days were so short in winter that they had always\ntheir hands full, and sometimes more than they could do. And spring\nwas always a busy time: the lambs had to be attended to; fences had to\nbe repaired; and so many \"crops\" had to be got in, that hay harvest\ncame upon them frequently before they were ready. Then huge fields of\nturnips and mangolds and potatoes had to be hoed, and ere that was done\nthe fields were white unto the harvest. Then came sheep-shearing and\nploughing land for next year's wheat crop, and potato digging, and half\na dozen other things, that allowed them no time for idleness, and it was\nwell for Benny that it was so. He had no time to mope or to waste in\nuseless regrets.\n\nOne evening he had to pass Brooklands on his way to a neighbouring\nfarm. The day had been beautifully fine--a real June day, people said;\na few people complained that it had been too hot about noon, but as\nthe day declined a fresh breeze had sprung up, that made the evening\ndeliciously cool. Benny enjoyed few things more than a saunter across\nthe fields during a summer's evening. And this evening he was just in\nthe mood to enjoy the song of birds, and the scent of apple blossom and\nnew-mown hay. It wanted several hours yet of sundown, so he sauntered\non very leisurely, and paused when near Mr. Munroe's house, arrested by\nthe sound of laughter. Not far from where he stood three or four young\nladies were engaged in a game of archery, and as he could not be seen by\nthem, he waited awhile to watch them. He did not know that one of those\nfair maidens was Eva Lawrence; how should he know? She was a little\ngirl when he saw her last, now she was just blooming into womanhood.\nThe beauty, of which her early life gave promise, was now more than\nrealized. But had Eva Lawrence been plain of feature, she would still\nhave been beautiful in the eyes of those who knew her well. Hers was\na beautiful life, and people did not wonder that it was mirrored in a\nlovely face. It was a picture that would have pleased an artist's eye\non which Benny gazed, and their rippling laughter formed a pleasant\naccompaniment to the rustling of the leaves and the music of the brook\nthat murmured down the glen. But as Benny gazed at the picture he only\nsaw one face, that of Eva Lawrence. He thought he had never seen the\nface before, and yet it affected him strangely. It seemed to bring back\nto him some half-forgotten dream. What was it that it reminded him of?\nHe could not tell; whatever it might be, it eluded his grasp. Like the\nsnatch of a forgotten song it came and went, leaving nothing definite\nupon the mind.\n\nAn hour later he returned by another way across the glen or ravine\n(adown which the brook babbled) by a narrow bridge with low parapets,\nand turned a sudden corner down the lane towards Scout Farm. For a\nmoment he paused and remarked to himself, \"This is a dangerous corner;\nI wonder Mr. Munroe does not alter it; and that bridge too, it is\naltogether too narrow. If I drove this way as often as he does, I would\npull down that antiquated structure, and build a good wide bridge with\na high wall on either side;\" and, having given expression to an opinion\nthat he had expressed a hundred times before, he turned on his heel and\nquietly pursued his way. He had not gone many yards, however, before he\nheard a great hue and cry, and, looking down the lane, he saw that Mr.\nMunroe's horse had taken fright, and was rushing towards him at headlong\nspeed. The coachman, who had been riding behind, had coolly dropped\nhimself down on the road, and stood staring after the flying carriage in\nblank astonishment, and shouting at the top of his voice. Benny saw that\nMr. Munroe was trying in vain to check the mad gallop of the horse,\nand he saw also that the young lady whose face had attracted him so\nstrangely before was sitting by his side, pale and motionless. Here and\nthere people rushed out from the fields into the road and held up their\nhands or hoes, but always retreated after a few frantic gesticulations\nin time for the affrighted steed to pass. Instantly Benny thought of\nthe sharp corner and the narrow bridge over the deep ravine. If the\nroad had been straight, the wisest course would have been to have given\nthe horse rein, and let it tire itself out. But as it was, the horse\nmust be stopped before it reached the bridge, or almost certain death\nwould be the fate of Mr. Munroe and his niece. He had little time to\nthink, but he knew that to attempt to stop the horse would be attended\nwith considerable risk to himself. If he failed to grasp the bridle the\nhorse and carriage would go over him, in all probability killing him on\nthe spot; but he had no time to debate the question, the startled horse\nwas full upon him. In an instant he dashed at the bridle and caught it,\nthe end of the shaft striking him on the arm at the same moment, almost\ncausing him to let go his hold, but he held tight. For a dozen yards the\nhorse dragged him along the road; then he succeeded in getting it on its\nknees with its nose against a hedge, and Mr. Munroe and Eva alighted in\nperfect safety. By this time, however, a number of people had gathered\nround, the coachman amongst the rest, who at once took charge of the\nhorse, and Benny slunk away as quietly as possible, and made his way\nalong the road as fast as he was able. Mr. Monroe, however, seeing his\nintentions, followed him at once.\n\n\"Come, come, my young friend,\" he said; \"I cannot let you go without\nthanking you for your noble act.\"\n\n\"Do not mention it, sir,\" said Benny, with an effort, turning pale at\nthe same time.\n\n\"I would be ungrateful indeed,\" said Mr. Munroe, \"were I not to mention\nit. No, I shall never forget that to your heroism my niece and myself\nowe our lives.\"\n\n\"I am very thankful if I have been of service to you,\" said Benny; \"but\nI could not have acted otherwise, so please----\"\n\nBut he did not finish the sentence; setting his teeth together, as if in\npain, he staggered towards a seat by the hedge.\n\nInstantly Mr. Munroe sprang towards him, exclaiming, \"You're hurt, I'm\nsure you are; tell me what's the matter.\"\n\n\"My arm is broken, that is all,\" said Benny, with a poor attempt at a\nsmile; then everything began to spin around him in a very bewildering\nmanner, and he could never exactly recollect what happened after. He\nalways carried with him, however, a lively recollection of the process\nof bone-setting, which he afterwards underwent, and of the sleepless\nnight that followed.\n\nNext morning Mr. Munroe came to Scout Farm and sat with Benny for half\nan hour, chatting about things in general, and before he left he thanked\nhim again in the warmest terms for his bravery, and made him promise\nto visit Brooklands as soon as he was able, stating that Mrs. Munroe\nwas very anxious to see him, as were also his daughters and niece,\nespecially the latter, who wanted to thank him personally for saving her\nlife.\n\nBenny blushed at first and begged to be excused, but Mr. Munroe would\nnot hear of it. So Benny reluctantly consented at last to endure the\nmartyrdom (to him) of being introduced to the fine ladies at the big\nhouse, and in his heart wished he was well out of it all. He felt sure\nthat he should look silly and make a hole in his manners, for he had\nnever been used to grand people; and what would be the proper thing to\nsay when they thanked him he had not the remotest idea.\n\n\"Well, Ben Bates,\" he said to himself when Mr. Munroe had left the room,\n\"you're in for it now, and no mistake. Here's a pretty kettle of fish\nfor you, my lad, and you've to see to it that you don't go and make\na fool of yourself. A lot you know about etiquette and drawing-room\nmanners; and won't you do the graceful before the ladies! Oh, dear,\ndear!\"\n\nAnd he laughed till the tears ran down his face, spite the pain in his\narm.\n\n\"I think I see you going through the introduction, my lad, trying to\ndo the thing proper as if you knew how, and only succeeding in making\nyourself look silly. And won't the ladies giggle after you're gone!\"\n\nThen Benny looked serious, and after a long pause he went on again:\n\n\"Look here, Ben Bates: do you think you are a downright fool, or do you\nthink you have just a few grains of common sense? For, unless you're a\nborn natural, you'll put on no airs at the big house; but you'll just\nbe yourself, remember, and not ape anybody else; you profess a great\nhatred of sham, then don't be a sham yourself, and make yourself look\nridiculous. Remember what you are, Ben Bates; and remember, too, that\nyou've got nothing to be ashamed of.\"\n\nThen, after another pause:\n\n\"I wish I was well out of this job, notwithstanding. I hate to be\nthanked. I wonder, by the bye, who that young lady is? How her face\nreminds me of something, something in the old life, but what I cannot\nmake out. How strange everything seems! I fancy sometimes I must have\nlived here always, and dreamed all the rest. But no, Nelly was real,\nand that shilling was real. Ah! I wonder what's become of her.\" And a\nfar-away look came into his eyes, as if he were back again in the old\nlife of mingled joy and pain.\n\nMeanwhile Mr. Munroe was out in the yard talking with Mr. Fisher.\n\n\"A fine young fellow that of yours, Mr. Fisher,\" was his first greeting.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the farmer; \"I'd back him against any young man his age for\nten miles round.\"\n\n\"An adopted son of yours, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Well, no, not exactly,\" replied Mr. Fisher.\n\n\"Beg pardon, I thought you had adopted him.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps you are not far wrong either. You see, he came to us five\nor six years agone, a poor little famished, wizened creature. It was a\nsweltering hot day too, and he had walked all the way from Liverpool,\nsleeping at nights by the roadside, and by the time he got here--or\nrather, he didn't get here--our folks were making hay in the home close,\nand he just got inside the gate, and dropped down in a fit, or something\nof the sort. Well, he was completely done up; the doctor never thought\nhe would come round again, but he did, and you see what a fine fellow\nhe's grown to.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed! And so he has lived with you ever since?\"\n\n\"Ever since. My wife says she believes the Lord directed him here. Any\nway, the boy was a great comfort to her, for we'd only just buried our\nlittle Rob, and he seemed to fill up the gap a bit, you see.\"\n\n\"I suppose you find him very handy about the farm now, Mr. Fisher?\"\n\n\"Handy? I tell you, there isn't his equal for miles around. He took to\nthe farm as natural as a duck takes to the water. In fact, the plucky\nlittle dog said he wouldn't stay to be a burden to us, and he never has\nbeen. In fact, if we came to square accounts, I fancy that I should find\nthat I was considerably in his debt.\"\n\n\"And you find him perfectly trustworthy?\"\n\n\"He's as honest as the daylight, sir, and as good as gold. Why, I'd\ntrust him with my life, and so would the missus. She thinks a sight of\nhim, I can assure you.\"\n\n\"I do not wonder at it, Mr. Fisher; he's a brave young fellow, and\ndeserves notice and help--if he needed it.\"\n\n\"Brave? Well, you've said just right in that, Mr. Munroe; he's as brave\nas a lion. I don't think the young dog knows what fear is. I expect\nit'll be getting him into trouble some of these days. But then, bless\nyou, on the other hand, he's as gentle as a woman, and the very soul of\nkindness. I believe the young scamp would give away the last copper he\nhad, if he saw some one he fancied wanted it more than himself.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Mr. Munroe, feeling rather amused at Mr. Fisher's\nenthusiasm. \"It is not often you see people possessing so many good\nqualities.\"\n\n\"Good! Well, you've hit it again, the lad _is_ good; and yet, mark you,\nhe ain't none of the goody-goody sort either. Why, bless you, he's as\nfull of fun and frolic as an egg is full of meat. You should just see\nthe carryings on we have here when the lads are home from school. I\nlaugh sometimes fit to kill myself, and yet feel as mad as a sheep at\n'em, for they give me no peace of my life.\"\n\n\"Well, we cannot expect the young folks to be as sedate and steady-going\nas we older people, Mr. Fisher.\"\n\n\"That's what my wife says, sir; she says it's as natural for the lads\nto play as it is for the kittens, and that it's quite as harmless, and\nI don't think she's far wrong. In fact, I generally give in to her;\nshe's had a sight better education than ever I had, so she ought to know\nbetter.\"\n\n\"Ah, speaking about education, Mr. Fisher, what sort of education has\nthis young man had?\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Munroe, I confess I'm no judge in matters of that sort. You\nsee, he was never at a day school a day in his life; but for all that he\nseems to have a natural gift for learning. Our George says he's got on\nwonderfully; and old Mr. Jones, that keeps the night school yonder at\nScoutleigh, says he can't teach him any more.\"\n\n\"Excuse me asking all these questions, Mr. Fisher, but I feel quite\ninterested in the young man. It's but natural I should, since I owe my\nlife to him; and I should like to do something for him, if I could see\nhow it's to be done.\"\n\n\"It's very kind of you, I'm sure, and I can assure you you'll not find\nme stand in the lad's way. Fact is, I've thought many times of late that\nhe's too good--too well informed, and that kind of thing--to be a farm\nlabourer all his life, and he'd never get enough as a day labourer to\nbecome a farmer on his own account.\"\n\n\"Just so; the same thought has occurred to me, but we'll see what can be\ndone. Good morning, Mr. Fisher.\"\n\n\"Good morning, sir, good morning.\"\n\nAnd Mr. Fisher went his way to his farm, and Mr. Munroe to the station,\nto catch the noon train to Manchester.\n\nBenny kept indoors two whole days, and declared that they were two of\nthe longest days of his life. But on the third morning he was out in the\nfields again with his arm in a sling. He could not work, so he took a\nbook with him and lay down by a sunny hedge, and read till dinner-time.\nHe would not be treated as an invalid.\n\n\"I'm all right but for my game arm,\" he said to Mrs. Fisher, when she\nbrought him some little delicacy that she had cooked for his special\nbenefit; \"and I think I know some one that will enjoy it a great deal\nmore than I should,\" looking across to baby Winnie, who was eyeing the\ndish with curious eyes. \"At any rate, she shall have a share. Come here,\nWinnie,\" he said, turning to the child, \"come to Benny.\"\n\nAnd the little bit of humanity slipped off her chair in what Benny would\nhave once characterized as \"sca'se no time,\" and came toddling round the\ntable towards him, holding up her little fat dimpled hands, and with\neyes brimful of delight.\n\n\"Take us up, 'enny,\" said the little prattler; \"Winnie 'oves 'oo very\nmuch.\"\n\n\"Easier said than done, you young foxy,\" said Benny, laughing down upon\nthe child. \"Come, mammy,\" turning to Mrs. Fisher, \"lend us a helping\nhand, and get this young soldier where she wants to be.\" And soon Benny\nand baby were eating out of the same dish, and it would have been hard\nto decide which enjoyed it most.\n\nSo day after day passed away, and Benny kept putting off the promised\nvisit to Brooklands. Mrs. Fisher was constantly reminding him of his\npromise, and yet every day he found some fresh excuse for staying away.\n\nOne afternoon, however, about a fortnight after the accident, he\nannounced to Mrs. Fisher that he was going to pay his promised visit to\nthe lions that afternoon.\n\n\"That's right, Benny; though I don't think from your own experience that\nyou have any occasion to call the ladies lions,\" and Mrs. Fisher bent on\nhim a knowing look.\n\n\"Right you are, mammy; I believe they are mostly angels after all, and\nperhaps those at Brooklands will be no exception to the rule.\"\n\n\"I'm sure they will be kind to you, Benny; so you had better be off and\nget ready.\"\n\nHalf an hour later he came into the sitting-room to Mrs. Fisher, dressed\nfor his visit.\n\n\"Now, mammy,\" he said, \"am I presentable?\"\n\n\"Go away with you,\" she said, laughing, though casting at the same\ntime an admiring look at the manly young fellow that stood before her,\n\"you'll be as proud as a peacock soon.\"\n\n\"Right you are again. I feel the pride creeping up already. But now for\na sight of the angels, so good-bye.\"\n\nAnd off he started to pay a visit that was to be fraught with vastly\nmore important issues than he had any conception of.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nRecognition.\n\n \"That strain again; it had a dying fall:\n  Oh, it came o'er my ear like the sweet south\n  That breathes upon a bank of violets,\n  Stealing and giving odour.\"--_Tempest_.\n\n\nWhen our hero reached the bridge that spanned the narrow dell, he paused\nfor a moment and looked over the low parapet at the deep gully that had\nbeen worn away by the action of the water, and shuddered as he thought\nof what would have happened had he failed to grasp the bridle-rein. \"I\nexpect this breakneck place will be remedied now,\" he said, \"that a\ncouple of lives have come near being lost over it. If the horse had\nnot been stopped there could not have been the least possible chance of\ntheir escape. Well, well, I'm thankful the affair ended in nothing worse\nthan a broken arm.\"\n\nPassing through the lodge gates, he wended his way slowly along the\ncarriage drive towards the house. High above his head the leafy canopy\nswayed gently in the summer breeze, making pleasant music, and here\nand there an industrious bee droned dreamily on leaf and flower. From\ndistant fields the sheep-bells jingled gently, and mingled with the\nwhistling of a plough-boy riding home his tired team, while from a\nneighbouring farmyard the patient cows lowed lazily while waiting to be\nmilked.\n\nWhen Benny reached the door of the Munroe mansion, he felt strongly\ntempted to turn and go back again; but concluding that such an action\nwould be exceedingly foolish, he seized the bell-handle, gave it a\nvigorous pull, and waited.\n\n\"Is Mr. Munroe at home?\" he inquired of the servant who opened the door.\n\n\"Yes; but he's engaged at present. Will you give me your name?\"\n\n\"Bates. But never mind, you need not disturb him; another time will do\nas well.\"\n\n\"I think the master has been expecting you to call,\" with a glance at\nBenny's arm.\n\n\"Very likely. I said I would call some afternoon.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he will see you, then. Come this way, please, into the\nlibrary.\"\n\nBenny followed without a word, and soon found himself surrounded on\nevery side with books.\n\n\"Oh, my!\" he said, \"I think I should enjoy spending a fortnight here.\nI wonder how long it would take me to read all these books, and how\nmuch longer to understand them? Ay, that's the rub--understanding and\nremembering what one does read.\"\n\nThen he ran his eye along shelf after shelf, reading only the titles.\n\n\"I expect I should feel like a boy in a sweet-shop, not knowing which\nbottle to start with. Ah, Wordsworth!\" as his eye caught the name. \"I've\nheard of him. I wonder what the inside is like?\"\n\nHe must have found something very interesting, for when Mr. Munroe came\ninto the room half an hour later, Benny did not notice his entrance.\nMr. Munroe watched him with an amused smile on his face for about five\nminutes, then said,\n\n\"I'm glad you've found something to take your fancy, Mr. Bates.\"\n\nBenny started, and blushed to the roots of his hair. In the first place\nhe thought he was alone, and in the second place it was the first time\nthat he had ever been addressed as \"mister.\"\n\n\"I beg pardon,\" he stammered out at length. \"I did not know you were in\nthe room.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it. I'm glad to see that you are fond of books; and I'm\nglad to see you here.\"\n\nBenny blushed again, but did not reply.\n\n\"I was afraid you were not coming,\" went on Mr. Munroe; \"but how is your\narm?\"\n\n\"Getting on nicely, thank you; the doctor says it will soon be as right\nas ever.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear it. It's a mercy we were not every one of us killed;\nbut I'm having a new bridge built. I've been _going_ to have it done for\nthe last ten years, but kept putting it off; however, they are going to\nstart with the job next week.\"\n\n\"I'm very glad to hear it,\" said Benny. \"It's not safe as it is at\npresent.\"\n\n\"No, no; you're quite right there.\"\n\nThen there was an awkward pause, and Benny began to feel uncomfortable.\nMr. Munroe was the first to speak.\n\n\"I wanted to see you here,\" he said, \"to have a little conversation with\nyou about--about--yourself,\" bringing out the last word with a jerk.\n\nBenny did not know what reply to make to this, so he said nothing.\n\n\"I understand you have not always lived in the country?\" questioned Mr.\nMunroe.\n\n\"No, sir; I lived in Liverpool till I was twelve or thirteen years of\nage.\"\n\n\"And how do you like farming?\"\n\n\"Very well, I think; but, really, I've scarcely thought about it.\"\n\n\"You are not uncomfortable, then?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! far from it. Mr. and Mrs. Fisher took me in when I was\nhouseless, homeless, friendless, and all but dead, and ever since have\ntreated me with the utmost kindness. I have a better home now than I\never had before in my life, and as for the work I do, I feel that it's\nbut poor compensation for the kindness bestowed upon me.\"\n\n\"You have no wish, then, to be anything different to what you are?\"\n\n\"I did not say so, sir; but as I have no expectation of being other than\nwhat I am, I try to be content.\"\n\n\"Ah, just so; and yet I am told you have paid considerable attention to\nintellectual pursuits.\"\n\n\"I have tried to make the most of my opportunities for acquiring\nknowledge. I'm fond of books--very; and knowledge I love for its own\nsake.\"\n\n\"Well spoken, Mr. Bates. I like to hear a young man talk in that way.\nYou are a good penman, Mr. Jones tells me.\"\n\n\"He has paid me that compliment before, but I am scarcely a judge.\"\n\n\"You understand bookkeeping?\"\n\n\"A little.\"\n\n\"Double entry?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Quick at accounts?\"\n\n\"I should think not. I have scarcely had sufficient practice.\"\n\n\"I suppose if you stay on the farm there is no prospect of your rising\nto anything higher than a day labourer?\"\n\n\"Not much, I fear.\"\n\n\"Well, now, Mr. Bates, I may as well out with it first as last. I am\nvery much pleased with you; I am, indeed. I cannot forget that you saved\nmy life, and the life of my niece; and I am anxious to help you to\nsomething better than being a farm labourer if you will let me. Almost\nany one can do farm work, and I think you are deserving of something\nbetter, because you have educated yourself for it. Now, I shall be\nglad to take you into my city office, and give you a start in life. I\ncommenced as a clerk at the desk, and what I have accomplished there is\nno reason why you may not. What do you say, now?\"\n\n\"I hardly know what to say,\" said Benny. \"I am very much obliged to you\nfor your kind offer, but I would like to talk with Mr. and Mrs. Fisher\nabout the matter before I come to a decision.\"\n\n\"You are quite right, Mr. Bates. Let me know this day week; and now let\nus go into the drawing-room and see the ladies.\"\n\nBenny followed Mr. Munroe like one in a dream up a broad flight of\nstairs, and into a large and luxuriantly furnished room. Then commenced\nthe introduction which he had so much dreaded. He bowed to each one in\nturn, Mr. Munroe mentioning the name of each person; but Benny never\nheard a word he said, and was never quite certain whether he was bowing\nto a lady or gentleman. It was over, however, at length, and he sat down\nwith a feeling of infinite relief, and took up a volume of Milton that\nwas lying on a table near him. Then Miss Munroe came forward with the\nquestion--\n\n\"Are you fond of poetry, Mr. Bates?\"\n\n\"Yes, very.\"\n\n\"You know Wordsworth, of course?\"\n\n\"No. I ought to be ashamed to say so, but I do not.\"\n\nAnd then followed a conversation about poets and authors of various\nkinds, and Benny soon forgot his shyness, and chatted away with as much\nfreedom as if he had been at Scout Farm.\n\nBy-and-bye Eva Lawrence came forward shyly, and with a soft blush\ntinging neck and face; and Miss Munroe rose and left her and Benny\ntogether. It was growing dusk by this time, and she sat with her back to\nthe light, so that Benny could scarcely see her face.\n\n\"I am very grateful to you, Mr. Bates,\" she began in a low voice, \"for\nyour bravery in stopping our horse the other night.\"\n\nBenny started, for something in the voice reminded him again of other\ndays, and he did not reply for a moment; and Eva went on--\n\n\"Uncle tells me that if you had not stopped the horse, nothing could\nhave saved us;\" and she shuddered slightly.\n\n\"I am very thankful, indeed, that I have been permitted to be of service\nto you,\" began Benny.\n\nThen Mrs. Munroe came forward, and the conversation drifted off into\nmatters in general, for which he was very thankful, and ended in Eva\nbeing requested to sing.\n\n\"What are your favourite songs?\" asked Mrs. Munroe.\n\n\"Well, I hardly know,\" said Benny, blushing. \"I know so very few; but\nthe simpler they are the better they please me, as a rule.\"\n\n\"Could you mention one or two?\"\n\n\"Yes; there is one called 'Love at Home,' which I like very much.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's one of your old songs, dear,\" said Mrs. Munroe, turning to\nEva. \"You remember it, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, quite well; but I don't care to sing it, aunt, unless Mr. Bates\nvery much wishes to hear it.\"\n\n\"I should like to hear it again very much,\" said Benny; \"but don't sing\nit if you would rather not.\"\n\n\"I will do my best, anyhow;\" and she got up and went to the piano.\n\n\"Ring for lights, dear,\" said Mrs. Munroe, addressing her daughter; \"it\nis getting quite dark.\"\n\n\"No, no, aunt, please,\" said Eva; \"I know it quite well without the\nmusic, and I think the gloaming is the nicest part of the day;\" and she\nsat down and began to play over the air; then there was a long pause,\nfor Eva's thoughts had wandered away elsewhere.\n\n\"We are all attention, dear,\" said Mrs. Munroe.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said Eva; \"but I was thinking of something else. I will\ntell you all about it directly, if you care to hear.\"\n\nThen, clear and sweet, rang out the words,\n\n \"There is beauty all around,\n    When there's love at home.\"\n\nAnd Benny felt thankful that the lights had not been brought, for in the\ngloom he could hide his emotion. When the song was finished, Eva swung\nherself round on the music-stool, and said,\n\n\"You will think me very silly, I have no doubt, but I never sing that\nold song without thinking of what happened years ago.\"\n\n\"Dear me, how old you talk!\" laughed her cousin.\n\n\"Well, Dot, I _am_ getting old; but never mind, I was only a little girl\nthen. Pa and I were returning from Chester, and when we landed from the\nrailway-boat, a pale hungry-looking lad came up to pa and asked him to\ncarry his bag. Well, pa had been delayed, and consequently he was in a\nhurry, so he said 'No' to the boy in a stern voice, and pushed roughly\npast, and I saw the boy turn away and begin to cry; so scarcely thinking\nwhat I was doing, I went to the boy and asked him why he cried, and he\nsaid he was hungry and cold, that he had no father or mother, and that\nhe had just buried his little sister, and nobody would employ him; so I\ngave him a new shilling that pa had given me, and asked him if he was\ngenerally on the landing-stage.\n\n\"'Yes,' he said; and his face brightened wonderfully at the sight of the\nshilling, and an honest-looking face it was too; 'I'm mostly hereabouts.'\n\n\"Well,\" continued Eva, after a pause, \"I thought no more about the lad\nfor several days, when one afternoon I was in the dining-room alone, and\nI began to play and sing 'Love at Home.' When I had finished, I rose to\nclose the window, and there just outside was the very boy I had given\nthe shilling to, his eyes full of tears; but when he saw he was noticed\nhe shrank away, as if ashamed he had been caught listening.\"\n\n\"And so you conceived a romantic attachment to the lad?\" chimed in Mr.\nMunroe.\n\n\"Of course I did, uncle; but to be serious. Teacher had been telling us\nthat we ought to be little missionaries, etc, and I thought this was a\nlikely case to experiment on. So I got pa interested, and in the end the\nboy was taken into his office, and a better boy pa said he never had. He\nwas honest, truthful, industrious, and seemed very anxious to learn.\"\n\nThen there was another pause, and if Benny ever felt thankful for the\ndarkness, he did then. It was all clear to him now. This, then, was his\nlittle angel, grown into a grand lady! and yet she had not forgotten the\npoor street boy. He would like to have spoken, and put an end to further\nrevelations, but he dared not trust himself to speak. Then Eva went on\nagain:\n\n\"I am come to the most painful part of the story. This boy had been with\npa six months, when one Saturday afternoon he left him in charge of\nthe office, but he had scarcely got a hundred yards from the door when\nhe remembered that he had left a bank note on his desk, and instantly\nturned back for it. Well, when he got into the office the note was\ngone. Nobody had been in the office but the boy, and yet he denied ever\nhaving seen it. Well, pa was quite in a way. He searched everywhere,\nbut it was not to be found. So the boy was apprehended on suspicion,\nand taken to the police-station. I was in a great way too, for it was\nthrough me that pa had employed the boy; still, I could not believe\nthat he was dishonest. At the trial he was given the benefit of the\ndoubt and dismissed, and has never been seen or heard of since. But the\nstrangest part of all is, about a month later pa wanted to look at the\nDirectory--a book he does not use very often--and the first thing on\nwhich his eye fell as he opened the book was the missing bank-note. He\n_was_ in a way when he came home, and we chatted about nothing else all\nthe evening, for he remembered then very distinctly how he had laid the\nnote on the open book, and before he went out had shut it up quickly,\nand placed it on the shelf. What troubled pa so much was, the boy had\nbeen robbed of his character, for the magistrates had little doubt of\nhis guilt, though there was no positive evidence; and when a lad's\ncharacter is gone his fortune is gone. All inquiries concerning him have\nbeen fruitless. And pa says sometimes that he feels occasionally as if\nhe had driven the poor boy to destruction. So you see whenever I sing\nthat song it always brings back to my mind this painful story.\"\n\nAfter the story was ended there was silence for a few moments. Benny\nwould liked to have spoken, but his heart was too full--to think that\nthe shadow was lifted from his life at last! He wished he could have\nbeen alone for a few moments, that he might out of the fulness of his\nheart have thanked God.\n\n\"What a pity,\" said Mrs. Munroe at length, \"that the boy could not be\nfound.\"\n\nThen Benny got up, and said in a voice tremulous with emotion, \"I must\ngo now, please; but before I go I would like to say that I am the lost\nboy.\"\n\n\"You!\" they all said in chorus.\n\n\"Yes. I cannot say more now.\" And he sat down again, and hid his face in\nhis hands.\n\n\"How strange!\" said Eva; \"but I see it all now. I could not think who\nyou reminded me of; but you have strangely altered.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose I have,\" he said huskily; \"and yet, perhaps, not more\nthan you have.\"\n\n\"How thankful pa will be!\" she said, not heeding his last remark. \"I\nwill write and tell him to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Munroe, speaking at length, \"if this is not the\nstrangest ending to a story that I ever came across!\"\n\n\"It's as good as a novel,\" said Miss Munroe. \"I declare it would make a\ncapital tale.\"\n\n\"And your father is satisfied that I am honest now?\" said Benny, going\ntowards Eva.\n\n\"Yes; but I don't think that he ever really believed you were dishonest.\"\n\n\"And you never doubted my honesty?\"\n\n\"No, never.\"\n\nThat was all that passed between them.\n\nWhen he had gone Mr. Munroe remarked, \"A wonderful young man that; I\nnever in my life met with a more remarkable case. How the young fellow\nhas managed to bear up and fight the world as he has is beyond my\ncomprehension.\"\n\n\"And he has the bearing of a gentleman too,\" remarked Miss Munroe. \"I\nexpected we were going to be highly amused at his behaviour and his\ndialect, and so on; but really he speaks quite correctly.\"\n\n\"He always was a well-behaved boy,\" remarked Eva; \"and during the time\nhe was in pa's office he told one of the clerks that he was very anxious\nto speak correctly.\"\n\n\"He must have worked very hard, however,\" said Mr. Munroe; \"and a lad\nwith such application, pluck, and determination is sure to get on. I\nconfess I shall watch his future career with great interest.\"\n\n\"But what surprises me most,\" said Mrs. Munroe, \"is the sterling honesty\nthat seems always to have characterized him. As a rule, those street\nArabs have the crudest notions of right and wrong.\"\n\n\"He told me once,\" said Eva, \"that he could just remember his mother,\nwho told him to be honest, and truthful, and good; but his little sister\nNelly, who died just before I met him, seems to have been his safeguard,\nand but for her he said he felt certain he should have been a thief.\"\n\nMeanwhile the subject of this conversation was making his way along the\nsilent lanes that lay between Brooklands and Scout Farm like one in a\ndream. Could it be really true, he mused, that he had seen his angel\nface to face, that he had listened again while she sang \"Love at Home,\"\nand that he had heard from her own lips how the lost bank-note had been\nfound, and how that now no stain rested upon his name? What a wonderful\nday it had been! Could it be possible that his long-buried hopes might\nbe realized at last?\n\nIn a lonely part of the road he paused and listened, but no sound broke\nthe stillness. Above him twinkled the silent stars; around him all\nnature lay hushed and still.\n\n\"God is here,\" he said; and lifting up his face to the sky, and clasping\nhis hands together, he poured out his heart in thanksgiving.\n\n\"O God!\" he said, \"I thank Thee for all things; for the sorrow, and\npain, and loss, for the darkness through which I have wandered, and\nfor the burdens I have had to bear. Thou hast never forsaken me. Thou\nhast always been good. I thank Thee for bringing me here, and for the\ndiscipline of toil. And now that Thou hast lifted off the cloud that so\nlong has darkened my life, help me to praise Thee, and love Thee more\nand more. I want to be good, and noble, and true. Help me, O Father, for\nThy mercy's sake.\"\n\nBenny slept but little that night. In the long silent hours he lived all\nhis life over again, and wondered at the mercy of God.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nThe Question Settled.\n\n  Life's withered leaves grow green again and fresh with childhood's spring.\n  As I am welcomed back once more within its rainbow ring;\n  The past, with all its gathered charms, beckons me back in joy,\n  And loving hearts and open arms re-clasp me as a boy.\n                                       --Massey.\n\n\nNext morning Benny was unusually quiet, so much so that Mrs. Fisher\nthought he was not well; but he insisted that nothing was the matter\nwith him, and she did not like to question him further. But when Mr.\nFisher came in to breakfast he began to rally Benny at once, and to ask\nhim how he got on with the grand folks on the previous evening.\n\n\"Very well, I think,\" Benny answered, simply; \"they all seemed very\ngrateful for the little service I had been able to render them.\"\n\n\"And did you find the ladies lions, Benny?\" inquired Mrs. Fisher.\n\n\"Indeed no,\" said Benny, colouring; \"they all of them made me think more\nof angels than of lions.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Mrs. Fisher, in a questioning tone.\n\n\"Yes, they treated me with the utmost kindness, every one of them; but,\nnow I think of it, the ladies always have done so,\" said Benny, with a\nlaugh.\n\n\"I should think so,\" interposed Mr. Fisher; \"but Mr. Munroe spoke to me\nabout helping you in some way: did he say anything to you about it?\"\n\n\"Yes; that was what he wanted to see me at his house for principally.\"\n\n\"Well, lad, out with it: did he make you an offer of some sort?\"\n\n\"Yes, he made me a very kind offer indeed.\"\n\n\"Well, Ben, what was it like? You are precious slow this morning.\"\n\n\"Am I?\"\n\n\"You are, indeed. He hasn't proposed suicide to you, has he?\"\n\n\"Not quite. But I had better tell you all that passed between us.\"\n\n\"Of course you accepted his offer?\" said Mr Fisher, when he had done.\n\n\"No, I did not.\"\n\n\"You didn't?\"\n\n\"No; I said I would like to talk to you about it before coming to a\ndecision.\"\n\n\"You needn't fear, lad,\" said Mr. Fisher, with a little shake in his\nvoice, \"that I will put a straw in your way. I shall be very sorry to\nlose you, I confess, for you have been a great help to me, especially as\nneither Harry nor George would take to farming, and I know you have been\na great comfort to the missus.\"\n\n\"That he has,\" said Mrs. Fisher, as if speaking to herself.\n\n\"But,\" continued Mr. Fisher, without heeding his wife's remark, \"I have\nthought for some time past that you might do better for yourself than\nslaving on a farm all the days of your life; and now that you've got\nthe chance of bettering your condition, my advice is, accept it by all\nmeans, and think yourself a lucky dog for getting such an offer.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Benny,\" said Mrs. Fisher, \"I think you had better accept Mr.\nMunroe's offer: such a chance does not often come twice in a lifetime;\nand besides, you can still make this your home--that is, you will be\nable to come on a Saturday night and stay until Monday morning.\"\n\n\"Of course you will, Ben; I never thought of that,\" said Mr. Fisher. \"I\nbelieve you have got into luck's way at last.\"\n\n\"But I have something more to tell you yet,\" said Benny, looking up with\na smile.\n\n\"More in the way of good luck?\" said Mr. Fisher.\n\n\"Well, I don't think the word luck will apply exactly, and yet what I\nhave to tell you is to me very good news indeed.\"\n\n\"Well, lad, out with it: you are beating about the bush in tremendous\nstyle this morning, and no mistake.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are so impatient!\" laughed Benny; \"and I declare you look a\ngreat deal more curious than Mrs. Fisher does.\"\n\n\"Well, and what has that to do with it, you tantalizing young vagabond?\"\n\n\"Oh, a great deal!\" said Benny, laughing: \"you always profess that\ncuriosity is a feminine weakness which you are a stranger to, and yet\nhere you are as curious and impatient as a schoolgirl!\" and Benny\nlaughed again.\n\n\"Well, Ben,\" laughed Mr. Fisher, \"you have me this time, I'll admit. I\nam a bit curious; there's no denying it; so let us know what this piece\nof good news is.\"\n\n\"You have heard me speak,\" said Benny, \"of the little girl that gave me\nmy lucky shilling years ago?\"\n\n\"The angel, you mean, Benny,\" said Mrs. Fisher, with a smile.\n\n\"Yes, that's who I mean,\" said Benny, blushing; \"and I am not quite\ncertain that she is not an angel yet.\"\n\n\"Well, and what of her?\" said Mr. Fisher.\n\n\"I daresay you will think it a strange story, but it seems she is a\nniece of Mr. Munroe, and is staying at present at Brooklands. She was\nwith Mr. Munroe the night the horse took fright, and so without knowing\nit I saved the life of the little girl that befriended me in the hour of\nmy greatest need. A little girl no longer, however, for she has grown\ninto a grand lady, and yet she seems as good and kind as ever.\"\n\n\"Well, I never!\" said Mr. Fisher.\n\n\"And you recognized each other at once?\" inquired his wife.\n\n\"No, that we didn't: she has grown out of recollection quite; and I\nsuppose I have also.\"\n\n\"Well, I should rather think you have,\" said Mr. Fisher, with a broad\ngrin; \"you were a scarecrow when you found your way here, and no\nmistake.\"\n\n\"But how did you find out who she was?\" said Mrs. Fisher.\n\n\"By the merest accident. But you would never guess, so I will tell you\nall about it.\" And he detailed the circumstances with which the reader\nis familiar.\n\n\"Well, if I ever!\" grunted Mr. Fisher.\n\n\"I'm so thankful, Benny,\" Mrs. Fisher remarked; \"though the finding of\nthe note can make no difference in our regard for you, for we never\ndoubted your honesty for a moment.\"\n\n\"Thank you, mammy;\" and he looked fondly up into the face of the good\nwoman who for so many years had been as a mother to him.\n\nAfter breakfast Benny took a book and went out into the fields to\nread, but somehow to-day the letters got hopelessly mixed, and all the\nlines seemed to run into one. He did his best to fix his mind upon the\nsubject of the book, but in vain: before he had read a dozen words the\nletters would fade away, and his thoughts would be somewhere else; and\nnot only his thoughts, but his eyes kept wandering in the direction of\nBrooklands, and he found himself weaving all kinds of fancies. But in\nevery pattern stood out the face of one he had never forgotten either\nin joy or pain. How grandly life was opening out before him again!\nThe mountain heights that had been so long in darkness were once more\nbathed in light. The wilderness surely lay all behind him now. Ah! he\nhad thought so once before, and had found out that he had only just\ncommenced the journey across the dreary waste. Was it to be so again?\nWould this glorious morning close in darkness? Were hopes always\ndelusive, and but the prelude of despair? He knew not; and yet he had\nno fear. \"The Lord,\" he said, \"has always provided for me; I believe He\nalways will.\"\n\nThen a lark rose up from its lowly nest near him, and went singing\nupward through the sky, and as he listened to the full rich song\nthat floated down to him, he seemed to hear in it the promise of an\never-faithful Friend--\"And not one of them falls to the ground without\nthe notice of His eye.... Are ye not much better than they?\"\n\nTowards the close of the afternoon Benny found himself in the lane that\nled down to the bridge that crossed the dell. He had no particular\nobject in view, only he loved a quiet stroll through the country lanes\nin the quiet of the day, and he was useless on the farm till his arm\ngot better. Below in the valley the river rippled pleasantly over its\nstony bed. To Benny's ears it sounded like a song, while his own fancy\nsupplied the words--\n\n \"There is beauty all around\n    When there's love at home.\"\n\nOn turning the sharp corner of which we have already spoken, he came\nsuddenly face to face with Eva Lawrence. Benny blushed scarlet; but Eva\nheld out her hand in a simple childish manner, and said frankly,\n\n\"I am pleased to see you----\" (she was about to say \"Benny,\" but checked\nherself), and added, \"I hope your arm is still improving.\"\n\n\"Yes, thank you; it will soon be as well as ever.\"\n\n\"I am very glad; but how strange, isn't it, that I should have found you\nagain?\"\n\n\"Yes, very; but my life has been a strange one altogether.\"\n\n\"I suppose so. Do you remember telling me all about your life up to the\ntime I first saw you on the landing-stage?\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember. Do you remember giving me the shilling? Of course you\ndo, for you mentioned it last night, but I wanted to tell you I have\nthat shilling yet.\"\n\nAnd Benny took the shilling out of his purse and handed it to her.\n\n\"How funny!\" said she, taking the coin in her hand; \"and is this the\nvery same?\"\n\n\"Yes; I have never had the heart to part with it, somehow, though I've\nwanted bread since you gave it to me. I call it my lucky shilling.\"\n\n\"How strange!\" she said, more to herself than to him. \"Then you have\nnever forgotten us?\"\n\n\"Forgotten you!\" said Benny, \"I should----\" Then he checked himself,\nand added, after a pause, \"No, I could not easily forget those who have\nbefriended me.\"\n\nBy this time they had reached the bridge, and Eva sat down on the low\nparapet, and Benny took a seat opposite her. For a while neither spoke,\nthen Eva looked up and said,\n\n\"Would you mind telling me about yourself since that dreadful evening\nyou had to leave pa's office?\"\n\n\"If you care to hear it, though I fear it would be a very uninteresting\nstory.\"\n\n\"I should like to hear it very much, for I have often wondered what\ncould have become of you.\"\n\n\"I should not have kept silence all these years if I had thought any one\ncared to know what had become of me, but I supposed that I should best\nplease those who had known me by keeping out of their sight.\"\n\n\"You were mistaken in that, I am sure; but never mind now, I am all\ncuriosity to hear your story.\"\n\nBenny could not resist this request, so he gave her an outline of what\nwe have given in greater detail, making as little as possible, however,\nof his sufferings and privations, and dwelling at length, and with much\nfeeling, on the kindness of his friends at the farm. Of his inner life\nhe said nothing. His religious experience seemed too deep for words, too\nsacred for parade, and he had not framed an experience yet to use on\npublic occasions, and he preferred also that his actions, rather than\nhis words, should reveal his religious life.\n\nEva listened with great attention, and her quick imagination supplied\nwhat she felt he had left out. For awhile there was silence after\nBenny had told his story, save for the clear river that babbled down\nunderneath the bridge, for both were thinking of the old days that had\npassed away for ever.\n\nAt length Eva arose and held out her hand, and Benny took the little\nwhite fingers in his hard brown palm, and held them just for a moment.\n\n\"Good evening, Mr. Bates; I must go home now,\" she said.\n\n\"Good evening, Miss Lawrence.\" And Benny watched her glide away among\nthe shadows of the tall trees, in the direction of Brooklands, then\nturned and walked slowly home.\n\nThe next morning, as he was leaving the house, he almost stumbled over\nMr. Lawrence, who on receipt of his daughter's letter had come over at\nonce.\n\n\"Mr. Lawrence!\" said Benny, in a tone of surprise.\n\n\"Then you _are_ Benny, I suppose,\" he said, \"as you recognize me, but I\nshould never have known you.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am Benny Bates, but you have not altered in the least; I should\nhave known you anywhere.\"\n\n\"Well, Benny,\" said Mr. Lawrence with much feeling, taking his hand,\n\"you cannot tell how thankful I am to see you alive and well.\" Then,\nglancing at Benny's arm, which he still carried in a sling, he added, \"I\nbeg pardon, I had forgotten your arm for a moment. I have to thank you\nalso for saving my daughter's life.\"\n\n\"Do not mention it, Mr. Lawrence; I have received abundant thanks\nalready.\"\n\n\"That may be, but I have much to say to you; can you spare time for a\nwalk?\"\n\n\"Yes, with pleasure; I am able to do nothing, as you see, and so time\nhangs rather heavy.\"\n\n\"Benny,\" said Mr. Lawrence, when they had gone some distance, \"when I\nfound that missing bank-note, I resolved that, if ever I saw you again\nor had the chance of speaking to you, I would ask your forgiveness for\nthe wrong I did you.\"\n\n\"Do not speak in that way, please,\" said Benny. \"If you wronged me it\nwas not intentionally, so that I have nothing to forgive; if I had, it\nshould be freely granted.\"\n\n\"Thank you. And now, Benny, will you return to Liverpool again? Not to\nbe office boy,\" he said, glancing at Benny's tall and well-knit frame;\n\"I can find you something much better than that, and I should like to\nmake you some reparation for all you have suffered through me.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Lawrence,\" said Benny firmly; \"but I could not come\nsimply to be tolerated because you fancied you had wronged me, and\nwished to make amends.\"\n\nMr. Lawrence looked up in surprise.\n\n\"You will understand what I mean, I think,\" said Benny. \"I am too old\nand too big to be any longer an object of charity, but if you think I\nam able to fill the place you want filled, and am worth the salary that\nyou are in the habit of paying, then I will consider your very kind\nproposal.\"\n\n\"I understand what you mean now,\" said Mr. Lawrence, \"and I must say I\nadmire your independence. I do not wish you to be an object of charity,\nfor Mr. Munroe tells me that he finds, through inquiries that he has\nmade, that you are a good penman, and quick at accounts, and if you\nwill come and take the vacant stool in my office, I shall be sincerely\nobliged.\"\n\n\"Thank you; but do you know that Mr. Munroe has made me a similar offer?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you require an answer now?\"\n\n\"To-morrow will do.\"\n\n\"Let it be to-morrow, then, please, and I will think about it in the\nmeanwhile.\"\n\nBenny had decided the question, however, before he slept that night.\nManchester was a strange place, Liverpool was his home. He knew every\nstreet for half a mile around the Custom House as well as he knew the\nlanes around Scout Farm. He had spent his childhood there; his earliest,\nay, and his happiest recollections were associated with it. It had been\nthe scene of his greatest struggles and triumphs. It had witnessed his\ndeepest joy and his bitterest sorrow, and though he had left it in\ndisgrace and pain, he loved it still. There were a few people there he\nhad pined to see. It was Joe Wrag's home; it was Nelly's resting-place;\ngranny lived there, and his Sunday-school teacher, and Mr. Lawrence,\nand--. But never mind, Liverpool was dear to him still, and in the very\nspot from which he had been driven in disgrace he would start afresh.\n\nNext morning he walked across to Brooklands, and asked to see Mr. Munroe.\n\n\"I have come,\" he said, as soon as that gentleman appeared, \"to tell you\nthat I cannot accept your very kind offer.\"\n\n\"I guessed as much,\" said Mr. Munroe, with a smile, \"when I heard Mr.\nLawrence had been after you. So Liverpool has more attractions for you\nthan Manchester, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, Liverpool is my home, and Manchester would be strange to me;\nbut I am very much obliged to you for your kindness.\"\n\n\"I do not blame you, Mr. Bates; on the contrary, I think you have acted\nwisely. Still, if at any time you should need a friend, you may reckon\nupon me.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Benny, with a shake in his voice, \"thank you very\nmuch; and now, sir, could I see Mr. Lawrence?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I will send him to you at once.\"\n\n\"Good morning, Benny,\" was Mr Lawrence's greeting; \"and have you settled\nthe matter?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I will accept your offer.\"\n\n\"That's right; I am glad to hear it. And now, when can you be ready?\"\n\n\"In a week, sir.\"\n\n\"That will do; and in the meantime I will secure lodgings for you, and\nmake things as straight and pleasant against your arrival as I possibly\ncan.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much.\"\n\n\"Don't name it; but I will send you word when I have secured a\ncomfortable home for you, so that if you like to send on your luggage\nbeforehand, you may do so.\"\n\nThe next few days Benny was busy getting his things together, previous\nto his departure from Scout Farm. Little Winnie followed him everywhere,\nand wanted him to promise her that he would not \"do away.\" He did not\nthink until he began to pack his things that the parting would cost him\nso much, nor did he know till then how closely the little prattling\nWinnie had twined herself around his heart.\n\n\"Benny does not 'ove his 'ittle Winnie, to do away,\" the child repeated\nover and over again, with choking voice and brimming eyes.\n\n\"Benny's pet,\" he would say, taking her up in his arms and kissing away\nher tears; \"he loves you more than he can tell.\"\n\n\"Then Benny'll stay with Winnie, won't he?\"\n\n\"Do you want Benny to stay very badly, eh, pet?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Winnie 'oves 'oo werry much; don't do away, Benny.\"\n\n\"I'll come back again at Christmas, Winnie, and then we'll have rare\nfun, and I'll bring you a new doll and heaps of oranges.\"\n\nBut the child would not be comforted.\n\nAt length the last morning of his stay arrived. It was a silent party\nthat sat down to breakfast, for the hearts of all were too full for\nspeech. Then the trap was brought round, and they all drove over to the\nstation together. The train was in time this morning, for which Benny\nfelt thankful. There was only time for a hurried good bye good-bye, an\nextra kiss for Winnie, and the train started for the busy town where\nBenny was to commence afresh the race of life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nThe Reward of Well-doing.\n\n  I have seen angels in the gloomy prison,\n    In crowded halls, by the lone widow's hearth;\n  And when they passed the fallen have uprisen,\n    The giddy paused, the mourner's hope had birth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  And by his side there moved a form of beauty,\n    Strewing sweet flowers along his path of life.\n  And looking up with meek and love-lent duty:\n    I call her angel, but he called her wife.\n\n\nOn reaching Liverpool, his first visit was to his sister's grave. He\nwould never have found it, were it not for a curious-shaped stone that\nhe had embedded in the sod ere he went away. As it was, he was a long\ntime before he could discover it among the hundreds of grass-grown\nmounds lying all around it. It seemed to him that he had lived a long\nlife since he lay there that summer night, and resolved that he would\nleave Liverpool behind him, and go out into the great world that lay\nbeyond to seek his fortune. \"Ah, well!\" he mused, \"I have made no\nfortune, but I have lived a life of peace, and God has taken care of me,\nand now I have come back again no longer a child, though scarcely a man,\nand I believe God will take care of me here.\" Kneeling by the little\ngrave, he offered up a silent prayer for help and protection. He thanked\nGod for his little sister that was safe from the world's temptation, and\nprayed that when he should be laid down to sleep by her side, they might\nmeet by the far-off Jordan river, and part no more for ever.\n\nHe was in a very subdued frame of mind when he left the cemetery and\nwended his way in the direction of Tempest Court. He could not help\nwondering as he threaded his way through the busy streets whether granny\nwas still alive, but he certainly did not expect to find that Tempest\nCourt was no longer in existence. Such, however, was the case. The march\nof improvement had swept away hundreds of tumble-down houses, in one\nof which granny had dwelt for so many years. But she did not live to\nsee that day. In the little home in which she had lived so long she was\npermitted to die; and so, when the \"destroyer,\" as she would have called\nit, came to Tempest Court, she was gone--gone home to the Father's\nmansion, to the \"house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.\"\n\nBut Benny knew nothing of this, and so he gazed with a look of pain\nat the heaps of broken bricks and mortar which men were busy carting\naway, and thought what a grief it would be to granny. His next visit\nwas to St. George's Hall, and for a while he sat in the shadow of the\ngreat portico to watch the hurrying crowds passing up and down. How\ndifferent it was from the silent country and the still, drowsy fields!\nWhat a tremendous hurry everybody seemed to be in! Was it always so? He\nhad never noticed it in the old days: surely the great town must have\ngrown bigger and busier in the years he had been away from it. \"But I\ndaresay I shall soon get used to it,\" he said to himself, as he rose\nfrom his seat, and started this time for the landing-stage. Here he saw\nno change. The mighty river was the same as in the old days, a scene of\nlife and beauty. But the children selling matches and the women crying\nnewspapers brought more vividly back to his mind than anything else the\ndays of his own childhood. In the cemetery it seemed a life-time since\nhe went away; here, on the stage, it seemed only yesterday since he was\na poor famished child, earning a precarious living as best he could. He\ncould hardly realize that he was a strong, well-dressed young man. Once\nor twice the word \"Perks\" leaped to his lips as a shock-headed ragged\nlad ran against him; and when a little girl came up to him with \"Fusees,\nsir?\" the face of his dead little sister seemed to flash upon him for\na moment, and he started and turned pale, then handed the child some\ncoppers, and patted her on the head, telling her to be a good girl.\n\nHe now began to think it time to put in an appearance at Mr. Lawrence's\noffice. But he could not resist the temptation of a sail to Birkenhead\nand back first. For years he had longed for the day when he would be\nrich enough to afford such a luxury; that day had come at last, and the\nwish should be gratified; and surely, as he floated across the broad\nplacid river and back again, no child ever felt half so delighted with a\nnew toy as did he.\n\nMr. Lawrence was pleased to see that our hero had arrived, and offered\nhim the option of a few days' holiday before he settled down to the\ndesk. But Benny said he would be quite ready for work on the following\nmorning; he only wanted to see Joe Wrag and granny, and he thought he\nwould be able to find them before the day closed, and he knew that he\nshould be happier at work than doing nothing.\n\nBenny's next move was to make inquiries of the police as to what streets\nwere being repaired; and, having been furnished with a list, he waited\nuntil half-past five, and then went in search of his old friend. But\nJoe was not so easily found as he had imagined. He went from one street\nto another until his list was exhausted; but all the watchmen were\nstrangers to him, and he began to fear that his old friend was either\ndead, or that failing health and strength had compelled him to retire\nfrom his occupation. Benny now began to consider what he was to do next,\nfor he had not the remotest idea in what part of the town Joe lived, if\nindeed he were still living.\n\nAt length it occurred to him that very likely the watchmen knew each\nother, and that if he were to inquire of one of them he might get\nsome idea of Joe's whereabouts. With Benny to think was to act very\nfrequently; so he walked up to an old man who was keeping watch in the\nstreet in which he then found himself, and put the question at once.\n\n\"Do you know an old man by the name of Joe Wrag?\"\n\n\"Oh, ay, very well.\"\n\n\"Then perhaps you could tell me where I might find him.\"\n\n\"In course I could. If you keep down Old Hall Street for haaf a mile,\nyou'll tumble over him, unless yer mind where yer goin'.\"\n\n\"Much obliged.\" And off Benny started with a very much lighter heart\nthan he had five minutes before. It was a warm July evening, and Benny\nespied the old man long before he got to him, sitting on a block of\nwood outside his hut, apparently buried in thought.\n\nFor a moment or two Benny stood before him without speaking, and Joe\nseemed utterly unconscious of his presence. Six years seemed to have\npassed very lightly over the old man's head. Benny could detect no\nchange in his features; he did not look a day older than he did the last\ntime he saw him.\n\nAt length Benny said, in a hesitating tone of voice, \"Good evening, Mr.\nWrag.\"\n\nJoe started, but scarcely lifted his eyes to the intruder; then\nanswered, after a pause,\n\n\"I'm none so much mister, as I knows on; I'm only plain Joe Wrag.\"\n\n\"This is a nice time of the year for you watchmen,\" said Benny, not\nknowing exactly what to say.\n\n\"Yes, it's purty fair; we don't git bothered quite so much wi' the\nyoungsters as we do in the winter.\"\n\n\"And so the children bother you in the winter, do they?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know they bother me so much, arter all; only they like\nthe fire, yer see, when the weather's cold.\"\n\n\"Just so; you'll get to know a great many children, I should think?\"\n\n\"Oh, ay, a goodish few.\"\n\n\"Did you ever know a lad called Benny Bates?\"\n\n\"Ay, yes, poor lad, I should think I did,\" said Joe, with a sigh; \"an'\nhis little sister too, purty little hangel; she's safe enough, thank\nGod. She's wi' the Lord in heaven, but where the poor lad is the Lord\nonly knows.\"\n\n\"Lost, then, is he?\"\n\n\"Oh, ay, poor bairn, poor persecuted lad; falsely accused he wur, an' it\nseemed to break his 'eart; he's never been heard of since.\"\n\n\"Do you think you would know him if he were to come back again?\"\n\n\"Ay, I should know 'im among a thousand,\" said the old man, still\nkeeping his eyes on the ground.\n\n\"Then look at me, Joe, and say if you know me.\"\n\nInstantly he rose to his feet, and, coming close to Benny, looked\nstraight in his face. Then raising his hands to heaven, he cried out, \"O\nLord of mercy!\" and fell upon Benny's neck and wept.\n\nWe will not tire the reader with repeating the conversation that passed\nbetween Joe and Benny that night. Each had a hundred things to say to\neach other, and each a hundred questions to ask. Darkness had crept\nover the earth, and the great town was silent and still, ere Benny left\nJoe's hut; and when at length he took his departure, Joe watched him\nuntil he had disappeared in the gloom, then looking up into the now\nstar-lighted sky, he clasped his hands together, while the tears ran\ndown his weatherbeaten cheeks, and cried out, \"Now, Lord, lettest Thou\nThy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation.\"\n\nNext day Benny settled down to work with a fixed determination to do his\nduty, and to make his way in the world if it could be honestly done. The\nsame truthfulness and perseverance, and diligence and honesty that had\ncharacterized him for so many years still marked his life, and raised\nhim month by month and year by year in the estimation of his employer\nand in the estimation of all with whom he came in contact. According to\npromise he spent his Christmas at Scout Farm, to the delight of little\nWinnie and of all the other members of the household, and returned to\ntown feeling all the better for a week's rest.\n\nWhen Benny had been in Liverpool about two years, a case that was tried\nat the assizes created considerable interest. The prisoner was found\nguilty of burglary and manslaughter, and sentenced to twenty-one years'\npenal servitude. In reading an account of the trial, Benny was struck\nwith the names of the prisoner, John Cadger, _alias_ Peeler, _alias_\nPerks. Could it be the Perks that he had known? So interested was he in\nthis question that he determined to find out if possible; and, after\nsome difficulty he was permitted to visit the prisoner in his cell,\nprevious to his removal to Dartmoor.\n\nBenny's first glance at the shock head and sinister face convinced him\nthat his worst fears were realized. For a moment he was unable to speak,\nthen summoning up all his courage, he held out his hand, saying, \"I'm\nvery sorry to see you here, Perks.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" snarled Perks, with a terrible oath.\n\n\"Do you not know me?\" said Benny.\n\n\"No! I only know you b'longs to the gentry tribe that are always down on\npoor chaps like us.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken there, Perks; I am Benny Bates.\"\n\n\"You!\" he said in astonishment, eyeing him from head to foot. \"Then you\nmust 'ave got mighty 'igh in the perfeshun. I could never dress like\nthat.\"\n\n\"I am not in the profession, as you call it,\" said Benny.\n\n\"Not in it?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say you've kep' honest all these years?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have.\"\n\n\"An' kep' in Liverpool?\"\n\n\"No.\" And Benny told him where he had been.\n\n\"Jist so; you'd a-been bound to take up the perfeshun if you 'ad kep'\nhere.\"\n\n\"I don't think so.\"\n\n\"I'm sure on it. Look 'ere: do you 'member that chat we 'ad that night\nI skeered yer so? Oh, lor!\" And Perks laughed till the tears ran down\nhis face. \"Well, Ben, I tried bein' honest arter I got out o' quad that\ntime. I did for sure, jist by way of speriment; but lor! 't were no\nuse,--I was nearly starved, an' I 'ad to take up the bizness agin or\nelse die.\"\n\n\"But why did not you do as I did?\"\n\n\"Never thought on it, and shouldn't a-'ad pluck enough to hacted it out\nif I 'ad.\"\n\nThen Benny talked seriously to Perks about his sin, and about the\neverlasting future beyond the grave; told him also about a loving\nSaviour, who was ready to forgive the vilest, and of the happy home He\nhad prepared for all.\n\nPerks listened in silence to all Benny had to say, only remarking when\nhe had finished, \"I wish I wur dead.\"\n\nHe confessed to Benny the justice of his sentence, though he would\ninsist upon it that society had made him what he was, and was to some\ndegree responsible for his wickedness.\n\nTo Benny the interview was a very painful one, and he felt it a relief\nwhen he found himself once more outside the prison walls. They never met\nagain. In less than three years Perks was summoned to appear before a\nhigher tribunal, to answer for the deeds done in the body.\n\nBenny had no sooner got settled in Liverpool than he sought out his\nold Sunday school, and became a teacher there; and often he told to the\nragged and neglected children that he gathered around him the story of\nhis life, and pointed out a bright future that might be theirs if they\nwould be industrious, truthful, and honest. Once during each summer\nhe made it a point of taking his class to Eastham Woods, knowing from\nhis own experience what a joy it would be to the poor boys to breathe\nthe fresh air, listen to the song of birds, and run races on the mossy\nsward. Benny was never idle. The one aim of his life was to do good, to\nbe \"rich in good works;\" and grandly he succeeded. His name in many a\nhome was like \"ointment poured forth,\" and young and old blessed him for\nhis kindly words and kindlier deeds.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd now what shall we more say? for tales must end while lives run on.\nYears--I need not say how many--have passed away since Benny again\ntook up his abode in Liverpool. He is now partner with Mr. Lawrence,\nin a business that has become more prosperous than ever. He lives in a\nbeautiful house of his own, and the angel that years ago brightened his\nchildhood now brightens his home; and sometimes on winter evenings he\ngathers his children around his knee, and shows them a shilling still\nbright and little worn, and tells them how their mother gave it to him\nwhen she was a little girl, and he a poor, ragged, starving boy upon\nthe streets; tells them how, by being honest, truthful, and persevering,\nhe had worked his way through many difficulties, and how, by the\nblessing and mercy of God, he had been kept until that day. And Ben, the\neldest lad, thinks how he will be brave and true like his father, and so\ngrow up to be an honourable man.\n\nHere, then, we will end our story--a story that contains more truth than\nfiction--and hope that the young people who may read it may learn the\nlesson we have aimed to teach, and so be helped to the cultivation of\nthose virtues that will yield them in this world \"a hundredfold more,\nand in the world to come life everlasting.\"\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Her Benny, by Silas Kitto Hocking\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HER BENNY ***\n\n***** This file should be named 43325-8.txt or 43325-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/4\/3\/3\/2\/43325\/\n\nProduced by Clare Graham and Marc D'Hooghe at\nhttp:\/\/www.freeliterature.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":606,"split":"train"}
