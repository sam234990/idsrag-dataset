{"ori_id":"7c7aac6ea7b743af1d50a24a6adc38e248e6956c","title":"The Morgesons","context":"The Morgesons\n Stoddard\u2019s novel traces the education and development of a young female in American middle-class society. The protagonist, Cassandra Morgeson, is educated by a series of journeys she makes throughout her youth and early adulthood. Each new setting represents a different stage in her intellectual development.\nCassandra is born in Surrey, a small New England town. Surrey is quiet and isolated, granting a young woman little intellectual stimulation. Cassandra escapes the boredom of domestic life through stories of adventure and exploration. Surrey instills in Cassandra a restlessness that drives her quest for knowledge and experience.\nAt the age of thirteen, Cassandra\u2019s parents send her to live with her grandfather in Barmouth. Excessively religious, Grandfather Warren takes it upon himself to put Cassandra in her place. She is both intellectually and emotionally starved in Barmouth. Her life becomes narrowed down to home, school and church. In school, all the students dress alike and wear their hair in the same fashion. She learns an important lesson in conformity (peer pressure).\nWhen Cassandra turns eighteen she is invited to stay with some cousins in Rosville. Rosville offers her a glimpse of city life. She attends numerous balls, whist parties and shopping sprees in Boston. She also falls in love with her cousin Charles. Charles\u2019s dark sensuality and power awakens Cassandra\u2019s sexuality, which is an integral part in her self-discovery. Cassandra quickly finds herself caught up in a passionate, adulterous love affair. Their affair is cut short in a tragic accident that costs Charles his life. Cassandra escapes with a scar across her face, which remains with her as a constant reminder of the affair.\nCassandra then travels to Belem, a city of wealth and nobility. She stays in the home of her friend, Ben Somers. In Belem she is forced to confront the social injustice of class. Here she falls for Ben\u2019s brother, Desmond. Desmond sees into Cassandra\u2019s heart through the scar on her face. He finds in Cassandra a reason to reform himself and conquer his alcoholism. He promises himself to her and then goes off to Spain to cure his addiction.\nUpon her return to Surrey, Cassandra discovers that her mother has died. As the eldest and most capable daughter, the role of lady of the house is passed down to her. She becomes responsible for managing the household and taking care of her younger sister, Veronica. Cassandra resents her inherited role and envisions the rest of her days spent in monotony and misery. Her sister, Veronica, marries the wealthy but alcoholic Ben Somers. Two years after they are married, Ben dies of alcoholism, leaving Veronica to look after their child who \u201c\u2026never cries, never moves, except when it is moved\u201d (252). Some critics see this child as a physical representation of how Veronica\u2019s search for independence and autonomy has been stunted by her marriage. In the close of the novel \u201cher eyes go no more in quest of something beyond\u201d (252).\nCassandra marries the newly reformed Desmond. Her quest for self-definition does not end with marriage though. Cassandra narrates the closing pages of the novel from her desk. She is in the process of writing her life story. Writing allows Cassandra to take an active role in defining herself. Her novel helps her to assert her autonomy and achieve her goal of self-possession.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Morgesons, by Elizabeth Stoddard\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

My years were passed in an attempt to\nhave a good time, according to the desires and fancies of youth. Of\nliterature and the literary life, I and my tribe knew nothing; we had\nnot discovered \"sermons in stones.\" Where then was the panorama of\nmy stories and novels stored, that was unrolled in my new sphere? Of\ncourse, being moderately intelligent I read everything that came in\nmy way, but merely for amusement. It had been laid up against me as a\npersistent fault, which was not profitable; I should peruse moral,\nand pious works, or take up sewing,--that interminable thing, \"white\nseam,\" which filled the leisure moments of the right-minded. To\nthe _personnel_ of writers I gave little heed; it was the hero they\ncreated that charmed me, like Miss Porter's gallant Pole, Sobieski, or\nthe ardent Ernest Maltravers, of Bulwer.\n\nI had now come to live among those who made books, and were interested\nin all their material, for all was for the glory of the whole.\nPrefaces, notes, indexes, were unnoticed by me,--even Walter Scott's\nand Lord Byron's. I began to get glimpses of a profound ignorance, and\ndid not like the position as an outside consideration. These mental\nproductive adversities abased me. I was well enough in my way, but\nnothing was expected from me in their way, and when I beheld their\nardor in composition, and its fine emulation, like \"a sheep before her\nshearers,\" I was dumb. The environment pressed upon me, my pride was\ntouched; my situation, though \"tolerable, was not to be endured.\"\n\nFortunate or not, we were poor. It was not strange that I should\nmarry, said those who knew the step I had taken; but that I should\nfollow that old idyl; and accept the destiny of a garret and a\ncrust with a poet, was incredible! Therefore, being apart from the\ndiversions of society, I had many idle hours. One day when my husband\nwas sitting at the receipt of customs, for he had obtained a modest\nappointment, I sat by a little desk, where my portfolio lay open.\nA pen was near, which I took up, and it began to write, wildly like\n\"Planchette\" upon her board, or like a kitten clutching a ball of yarn\nfearfully. But doing it again--I could not say why--my mind began upon\na festival in my childhood, which my mother arranged for several poor\nold people at Thanksgiving. I finished the sketch in private, and gave\nit the title of \"A Christmas Dinner,\" as one more modern. I put in\noccasional \"fiblets\" about the respectable guests, Mrs. Carver\nand Mrs. Chandler, and one dreadful little girl foisted upon me to\nentertain. It pleased the editor of _Harper's Magazine_, who accepted\nit, and sent me a check which would look wondrous small now. I wrote\nsimilar sketches, which were published in that magazine. Then I\nannounced my intention of writing a \"long story,\" and was told by him\nof the customs that he thought I \"lacked the constructive faculty.\"\nI hope that I am writing an object lesson, either of learning how, or\nnot learning how, to write.\n\nI labored daily, when alone, for weeks; how many sheets of foolscap I\ncovered, and dashed to earth, was never told. Since, by my \"infinite\npains and groans,\" I have been reminded of Barkis, in \"David\nCopperfield,\" when he crawled out of his bed to get a guinea from\nhis strong box for David's dinner. Naturally, I sent the story to\n_Harper's Magazine_, and it was curtly refused. My husband, moved by\npity by my discouragement, sent it to Mr. Lowell, then editor of the\n_Atlantic Monthly_. In a few days I received a letter from him, which\nmade me very happy. He accepted the story, and wrote me then, and\nafterwards, letters of advice and suggestion. I think he saw through\nmy mind, its struggles, its ignorance, and its ambition. Also I got my\nguinea for my pains. The _Atlantic Monthly_ sent me a hundred dollars.\nI doubt but for Mr. Lowell's interest and kindness I should ever have\ntried prose again. I owe a debt of gratitude to him which I shall\nalways give to his noble memory.\n\nMy story did not set the river on fire, as stories are apt to do\nnowadays. It attracted so little notice from those I knew, and\nknew of, that naturally my ambition would have been crushed.\nNotwithstanding, and saying nothing to anybody, I began \"The\nMorgesons,\" and everywhere I went, like Mary's lamb, my MS. was sure\nto go. Meandering along the path of that family, I took them much to\nheart, and finished their record within a year. I may say here, that\nthe clans I marshaled for my pages had vanished from the sphere\nof reality--in my early day the village Squire, peerless in blue\nbroadcloth, who scolded, advised, and helped his poorer neighbors; the\nwidows, or maidens, who accepting service \"as a favor,\" often remained\na lifetime as friend as well as \"help;\" the race of coast-wise\ncaptains and traders, from Maine to Florida, as acute as they were\nignorant; the rovers of the Atlantic and the Pacific, were gone not\nto return. If with these characters I have deserved the name of\n\"realist,\" I have also clothed my skeletons with the robe of romance.\n\"The Morgesons\" completed, and no objections made to its publication,\nit was published. As an author friend happened to be with us, almost\non the day it was out, I gave it to him to read, and he returned it to\nme with the remark that there were \"a good many _whiches_ in it.\" That\nthere were, I must own, and that it was difficult to extirpate them. I\nwas annoyed at their fertility. The inhabitants of my ancient dwelling\nplace pounced upon \"The Morgesons,\" because they were convinced it\nwould prove to be a version of my relations, and my own life. I think\none copy passed from hand to hand, but the interest in it soon blew\nover, and I have not been noticed there since.\n\n\"Two Men\" I began as I did the others, with a single motive; the\nshadow of a man passed before me, and I built a visionary fabric round\nhim. I have never tried to girdle the earth; my limits are narrow; the\nmodern novel, as Andrew Lang lately calls it,--with its love-making,\ndisquisition, description, history, theology, ethics,--I have\nno sprinkling of. My last novel, \"Temple House,\" was personally\nconducted, so far that I went to Plymouth to find a suitable abode for\nmy hero, Angus Gates, and to measure with my eye the distance between\nthe bar in the bay and the shore, the scene of a famous wreck before\nthe Revolution. As my stories and novels were never in touch with my\nactual life, they seem now as if they were written by a ghost of\ntheir time. It is to strangers from strange places that I owe the most\nsympathetic recognition. Some have come to me, and from many I have\nhad letters that warmed my heart, and cheered my mind. Beside the name\nof Mr. Lowell, I mention two New England names, to spare me the\nfate of the prophet of the Gospel, the late Maria Louise Pool, whose\nlamentable death came far too early, and Nathaniel Hawthorne, who\nlived to read \"The Morgesons\" only, and to write me a characteristic\nletter. With some slight criticism, he wrote, \"Pray pardon my\nfrankness, for what is the use of saying anything, unless we say what\nwe think?... Otherwise it seemed to me as genuine and lifelike as\nanything that pen and ink can do. There are very few books of which\nI take the trouble to have any opinion at all, or of which I\ncould retain any memory so long after reading them as I do of 'The\nMorgesons.'\"\n\nCould better words be written for the send-off of these novels?\n\nELIZABETH STODDARD. New York, May 2nd, 1901.\n\n\n\n\nTO MRS. KATHARINE HOOKER\n\nOF LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA\n\nTHESE NOVELS ARE DEDICATED IN GRATEFUL REMEMBRANCE OF A KIND DEED\n\nELIZABETH STODDARD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\n\"That child,\" said my aunt Mercy, looking at me with indigo-colored\neyes, \"is possessed.\"\n\nWhen my aunt said this I was climbing a chest of drawers, by its\nknobs, in order to reach the book-shelves above it, where my favorite\nwork, \"The Northern Regions,\" was kept, together with \"Baxter's\nSaints' Rest,\" and other volumes of that sort, belonging to my mother;\nand those my father bought for his own reading, and which I liked,\nthough I only caught a glimpse of their meaning by strenuous study.\nTo this day Sheridan's Comedies, Sterne's Sentimental Journey, and\nCaptain Cook's Voyages are so mixed up in my remembrance that I am\nstill uncertain whether it was Sterne who ate baked dog with Maria, or\nSheridan who wept over a dead ass in the Sandwich Islands.\n\nAfter I had made a dash at and captured my book, I seated myself with\ndifficulty on the edge of the chest of drawers, and was soon lost in\nan Esquimaux hut. Presently, in crossing my feet, my shoes, which were\nlarge, dropped on the painted floor with a loud noise. I looked at my\naunt; her regards were still fixed upon me, but they did not interfere\nwith her occupation of knitting; neither did they interrupt her habit\nof chewing cloves, flagroot, or grains of rice. If these articles were\nnot at hand, she chewed a small chip.\n\n\"Aunt Merce, poor Hepburn chewed his shoes, when he was in Davis's\nStraits.\"\n\n\"Mary, look at that child's stockings.\"\n\nMother raised her eyes from the _Boston Recorder_, and the article\nshe had been absorbed in the proceedings of an Ecclesiastical Council,\nwhich had discussed (she read aloud to Aunt Merce) the conduct of\nBrother Thaddeus Turner, pastor of the Congregational Church of\nHyena. Brother Thaddeus had spoken lightly of the difference between\nSprinkling and Immersion, and had even called Hyena's Baptist minister\n\"_Brother_.\" He was contumacious at first, was Brother Thaddeus, but\nBrother Boanerges from Andover finally floored him.\n\n\"Cassandra,\" said mother, presently, \"come here.\"\n\nI obeyed with reluctance, making a show of turning down a leaf.\n\n\"Child,\" she continued, and her eyes wandered over me dreamily, till\nthey dropped on my stockings; \"why will you waste so much time on\nunprofitable stories?\"\n\n\"Mother, I hate good stories, all but the Shepherd of Salisbury Plain;\nI like that, because it makes me hungry to read about the roasted\npotatoes the shepherd had for breakfast and supper. Would it make me\nthankful if you only gave me potatoes without salt?\"\n\n\"Not unless your heart is right before God.\"\n\n\"'_The Lord my Shepherd is_,'\" sang Aunt Merce.\n\nI put my hands over my ears, and looked defiantly round the room.\nIts walls are no longer standing, and the hands of its builders have\ncrumbled to dust. Some mental accident impressed this picture on the\npurblind memory of childhood.\n\nWe were in mother's winter room. She was in a low, chintz-covered\nchair; Aunt Merce sat by the window, in a straight-backed chair, that\nrocked querulously, and likewise covered with chintz, of a red and\nyellow pattern. Before the lower half of the windows were curtains of\nred serge, which she rattled apart on their brass rods, whenever she\nheard a footstep, or the creak of a wheel in the road below. The walls\nwere hung with white paper, through which ran thread-like stripes of\ngreen. A square of green and chocolate-colored English carpet covered\nthe middle of the floor, and a row of straw chairs stood around it,\non the bare, lead-colored boards. A huge bed, with a chintz top shaped\nlike an elephant's back, was in one corner, and a six-legged mahogany\ntable in another. One side of the room where the fireplace was set\nwas paneled in wood; its fire had burned down in the shining Franklin\nstove, and broken brands were standing upright. The charred backlog\nstill smoldered, its sap hissed and bubbled at each end.\n\nAunt Merce rummaged her pocket for flagroot; mother resumed her paper.\n\n\"May I put on, for a little while, my new slippers?\" I asked, longing\nto escape the oppressive atmosphere of the room.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered mother, \"but come in soon, it will be supper-time.\"\n\nI bounded away, found my slippers, and was walking down stairs on\ntiptoe, holding up my linsey-woolsey frock, when I saw the door of my\ngreat-grandfather's room ajar. I pushed it open, went in, and saw a\nvery old man, his head bound with a red-silk handkerchief, bolstered\nin bed. His wife, grandmother-in-law, sat by the fire reading a great\nBible.\n\n\"Marm Tamor, will you please show me Ruth and Boaz?\" I asked.\n\nShe complied by turning over the leaves till she came to the picture.\n\n\"Did Ruth love Boaz dreadfully much?\"\n\n\"Oh, oh,\" groaned the old man, \"what is the imp doing here? Drive her\naway. Scat.\"\n\nI skipped out by a side door, down an alley paved with blue pebbles,\nswung the high gate open, and walked up and down the gravel walk which\nbordered the roadside, admiring my slippers, and wishing that some\nacquaintance with poor shoes could see me. I thought then I would\nclimb the high gateposts, which had a flat top, and take there the\nposition of the little girl in \"The Shawl Dance.\" I had no sooner\ntaken it than Aunt Merce appeared at the door, and gave a shriek at\nthe sight, which tempted me to jump toward her with extended arms. I\nwas seized and carried into the house, where supper was administered,\nand I was put to bed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nAt this time I was ten years old. We lived in a New England village,\nSurrey, which was situated on an inlet of a large bay that opened into\nthe Atlantic. From the observatory of our house we could see how the\ninlet was pinched by the long claws of the land, which nearly enclosed\nit. Opposite the village, some ten miles across, a range of islands\nshut out the main waters of the bay. For miles on the outer side\nof the curving prongs of land stretched a rugged, desolate coast,\nindented with coves and creeks, lined with bowlders of granite half\nsunken in the sea, and edged by beaches overgrown with pale sedge, or\ncovered with beds of seaweed. Nothing alive, except the gulls, abode\non these solitary shores. No lighthouse stood on any point, to shake\nits long, warning light across the mariners' wake. Now and then a\ndrowned man floated in among the sedge, or a small craft went to\npieces on the rocks. When an easterly wind prevailed, the coast\nresounded with the bellowing sea, which brought us tidings from those\ninaccessible spots. We heard its roar as it leaped over the rocks\non Gloster Point, and its long, unbroken wail when it rolled in on\nWhitefoot Beach. In mild weather, too, when our harbor was quiet, we\nstill heard its whimper. Behind the village, the ground rose toward\nthe north, where the horizon was bounded by woods of oak and pine,\nintersected by crooked roads, which led to towns and villages near\nus. The inland scenery was tame; no hill or dale broke its dull\nuniformity. Cornfields and meadows of red grass walled with gray\nstone, lay between the village and the border of the woods. Seaward\nit was enchanting--beautiful under the sun and moon and clouds. Our\nfamily had lived in Surrey for years. Probably some Puritan of\nthe name of Morgeson had moved from an earlier settlement, and,\nappropriating a few acres in what was now its center, lived long\nenough upon them to see his sons and daughters married to the sons and\ndaughters of similar settlers. So our name was in perpetuation, though\nnone of our race ever made a mark in his circle, or attained a place\namong the great ones of his day. The family recipes for curing herbs\nand hams, and making cordials, were in better preservation than the\nmemory of their makers. It is certain that they were not a progressive\nor changeable family. No tradition of any individuality remains\nconcerning them. There was a confusion in the minds of the survivors\nof the various generations about the degree of their relationship to\nthose who were buried, and whose names and ages simply were cut in the\nstones which headed their graves. The _meum_ and _tuum_ of blood were\ninextricably mixed; so they contented themselves with giving their\nchildren the old Christian names which were carved on the headstones,\nand which, in time, added a still more profound darkness to the\nanti-heraldic memory of the Morgesons. They had no knowledge of\nthat treasure which so many of our New England families are boastful\nof--the Ancestor who came over in the Mayflower, or by himself, with\na grant of land from Parliament. It was not known whether two or three\nbrothers sailed together from the Old World and settled in the New.\nThey had no portrait, nor curious chair, nor rusty weapon--no old\nBible, nor drinking cup, nor remnant of brocade.\n\n_Morgeson_--_Born_--_Lived_--_Died_--were all their archives. But\nthere is a dignity in mere perpetuity, a strength in the narrowest\naffinities. This dignity and strength were theirs. They are still\nvital in our rural population. Occasionally something fine is their\nresult; an aboriginal reappears to prove the plastic powers of nature.\n\nMy great-grandfather, Locke Morgeson, the old man whose head I saw\nbound in a red handkerchief, was the first noticeable man of the name.\nHe was a scale of enthusiasms, ranging from the melancholy to the\nsarcastic. When I heard him talked of, it seemed to me that he was\nborn under the influence of the sea, while the rest of the tribe\ninherited the character of the landscape. Comprehension of life, and\ncomprehension of self, came too late for him to make either of value.\nThe spirit of progress, however, which prompted his schemes benefited\nothers. The most that could be said of him was that he had the\nrudiments of a Founder.\n\nMy father, whose name was Locke Morgeson also, married early. My\nmother was five years his elder; her maiden name was Mary Warren. She\nwas the daughter of Philip Warren, of Barmouth, near Surrey. He was\nthe best of the Barmouth tailors, though he never changed the cut of\nhis garments; he was a rigidly pious man, of great influence in the\nchurch, and was descended from Sir Edward Warren, a gentleman of\nDevon, who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth. The name of his more\nimmediate ancestor, Richard Warren, was in \"New England's Memorial.\"\nHow father first met mother I know not. She was singularly\nbeautiful--beautiful even to the day of her death; but she was poor,\nand without connection, for Philip Warren was the last of his name.\nWhat the Warrens might have been was nothing to the Morgesons; they\nthemselves had no past, and only realized the present. They never\nthought of inquiring into that matter, so they opposed, with great\npromptness, father's wish to marry Mary Warren. All, except old Locke\nMorgeson, his grandfather, who rode over to Barmouth to see her one\nday, and when he came back told father to take her, offered him half\nhis house to live in, and promised to push him in the world. His offer\nquelled the rioters, silencing in particular the opposition of John\nMorgeson, father's father.\n\nIn a month from this time, Locke Morgeson, Jr., took Mary Warren from\nher father's house as his wife. Grandfather Warren prayed a long,\nunintelligible prayer over them, helped them into the large,\nyellow-bottomed chaise which belonged to Grandfather Locke, and the\nyoung couple drove to their new home, the old mansion. Grandfather\nLocke went away in the same yellow-bottomed chaise a week after, and\nreturned in a few days with a tall lady of fifty by his side--\"Marm\nTamor,\" a twig of the Morgeson tree, being his third cousin, whom he\nhad married. This marriage was Grandfather Locke's last mistake. He\nwas then near eighty, but lived long enough to fulfill his promises\nto father. The next year I was born, and four years after, my sister\nVeronica. Grandfather Locke named us, and charged father not to\nconsult the Morgeson tombstones for names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\n\"Mrs. Saunders,\" said mother, \"don't let that soap boil over. Cassy,\nkeep away from it.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" replied Mrs. Saunders, \"there's no fat in the bones to bile.\nCassy's grown dreadful fast, ain't she? How long has the old man been\ndead, Mis Morgeson?\"\n\n\"Three years, Mrs. Saunders.\"\n\n\"How time do fly,\" remarked Mrs. Saunders, mopping her wrinkled face\nwith a dark-blue handkerchief. \"The winter's sass is hardly put in\nthe cellar 'fore we have to cut off the sprouts, and up the taters\nfor planting agin. We shall all foller him soon.\" And she stirred the\nbones in the great kettle with the vigor of an ogress.\n\nWhen I heard her ask the question about Grandfather Locke, the\ninterval that had elapsed since his death swept through my mind. What\na little girl I was at the time! How much had since happened! But no\nthought remained with me long. I was about to settle whether I would\ngo to the beach and wade, or into the woods for snake-flowers, till\nschool-time, when my attention was again arrested by Mrs. Saunders\nsaying, \"I spose Marm Tamor went off with a large slice, and Mr. John\nMorgeson is mad to this day?\"\n\nMother was prevented from answering by the appearance of the said Mr.\nJohn Morgeson, who darkened the threshold of the kitchen door, but\nadvanced no further. I looked at him with curiosity; if he were mad,\nhe might be interesting. He was a large, portly man, over sixty, with\nsplendid black hair slightly grizzled, a prominent nose, and fair\ncomplexion. I did not like him, and determined not to speak to him.\n\n\"Say good-morning, Cassandra,\" said mother, in a low voice.\n\n\"No,\" I answered loudly, \"I am not fond of my grandfather.\"\n\nMrs. Saunders mopped her face again, grinning with delight behind her\nhandkerchief.\n\n\"Debby, my wife, wants you, Mis Saunders, after you have made Mary's\nsoap,\" he said.\n\n\"Surely,\" she answered.\n\n\"Where is the black horse to-day?\" he asked mother.\n\n\"Locke has gone to Milford with him.\"\n\n\"I wanted the black horse to-day,\" he said, turning away.\n\n\"He's a mighty grand man, he is,\" commented Mrs. Saunders. \"I am\npesky glad, Mis Morgeson, that you have never put foot in his house. I\n'plaud your sperit!\"\n\n\"School-time, Cassy,\" said mother. \"Will you have some gingerbread\nto carry? Tell me when you come home what you have read in the New\nTestament.\"\n\n\"My boy does read beautiful,\" said Mrs. Saunders. \"Where's the potash,\nMis Morgeson?\"\n\nI heard the bell toll as I loitered along the roadside, pulling a\ndandelion here and there, for it was in the month of May, and\nthrowing it in the rut for the next wheel to crush. When I reached\nthe schoolhouse I saw through the open door that the New Testament\nexercise was over. The teacher, Mrs. Desire Cushman, a tall, slender\nwoman, in a flounced calico dress, was walking up and down the room; a\nclass of boys and girls stood in a zigzag line before her, swaying to\nand fro, and drawling the multiplication table. She was yawning as\nI entered, which exercise forbade her speaking, and I took my seat\nwithout a reprimand. The flies were just coming; I watched their\nsticky legs as they feebly crawled over my old unpainted notched\ndesk, and crumbled my gingerbread for them; but they seemed to have no\nappetite. Some of the younger children were drowsy already, lulled by\nthe hum of the whisperers. Feeling very dull, I asked permission to go\nto the water-pail for a drink; let the tin cup fall into the water so\nthat the floor might be splashed; made faces at the good scholars, and\ndid what I could to make the time pass agreeably. At noon mother sent\nmy dinner, with the request that I should stay till night, on account\nof my being in the way while the household was in the crisis of\nsoap-making and whitewashing. I was exasperated, but I stayed. In the\nafternoon the minister came with two strangers to visit the school. I\nwent through my lessons with dignified inaccuracy, and was commended.\nGoing back, I happened to step on a loose board under my seat. I\ndetermined to punish Mrs. Desire for the undeserved praise I had just\nreceived, and pushed the board till it clattered and made a dust.\nWhen Mrs. Desire detected me she turned white with anger. I pushed it\nagain, making so much noise that the visitors turned to see the cause.\nShe shook her head in my direction, and I knew what was in store, as\nwe had been at enmity a long time, and she only waited for a decisive\npiece of mischief on my part. As soon as the visitors had gone, she\nsaid in a loud voice: \"Cassandra Morgeson, take your books and go\nhome. You shall not come here another day.\"\n\nI was glad to go, and marched home with the air of a conqueror, going\nto the keeping-room where mother sat with a basket of sewing. I saw\nTemperance Tinkham, the help, a maiden of thirty, laying the table for\nsupper.\n\n\"Don't wrinkle the tablecloth,\" she said crossly; \"and hang up your\nbonnet in the entry, where it belongs,\" taking it from me as she gave\nthe order, and going out to hang it up herself.\n\n\"I am turned out of school, mother, for pushing a board with my foot.\"\n\n\"Hi,\" said father, who was waiting for his supper; \"come here,\" and he\nwhistled to me. He took me on his knee, while mother looked at me with\ndoubt and sorrow.\n\n\"She is almost a woman, Mary.\"\n\n\"Locke, do you know that I am thirty-eight?\"\n\n\"And you are thirty-three, father,\" I exclaimed. He looked younger.\nI thought him handsome; he had a frank, firm face, an abundance of\nlight, curly hair, and was very robust. I took off his white\nbeaver hat, and pushed the curls away from his forehead. He had his\nriding-whip in his hand. I took that, too, and snapped it at our\nlittle dog, Kip. Father's clothes also pleased me--a lavender-colored\ncoat, with brass buttons, and trousers of the same color. I mentally\ncomposed for myself a suit to match his, and thought how well we\nshould look calling at Lady Teazle's house in London, only I was\nworried because my bonnet seemed to be too large for me. A loud crash\nin the kitchen disturbed my dream, and Temperance rushed in, dragging\nmy sister Veronica, whose hair was streaming with milk; she had pulled\na panful over her from the buttery shelf, while Temperance was taking\nup the supper. Father laughed, but mother said:\n\n\"What have I done, to be so tormented by these terrible children?\"\n\nHer mild blue eyes blazed, as she stamped her foot and clenched her\nhands. Father took his hat and left the room. Veronica sat down on the\nfloor, with her eyes fixed upon her, and I leaned against the wall. It\nwas a gust that I knew would soon blow over. Veronica knew it also. At\nthe right moment she cried out: \"Help Verry, she is sorry.\"\n\n\"Do eat your supper,\" Temperance called out in a loud voice. \"The hash\nis burnt to flinders.\"\n\nShe remained in the room to comment on our appetites, and encourage\nVeronica, who was never hungry, to eat.\n\nVeronica was an elfish creature, nine years old, diminutive and pale.\nHer long, silky brown hair, which was as straight as an Indian's, like\nmother's, and which she tore out when angry, usually covered her face,\nand her wild eyes looked wilder still peeping through it. She was too\nstrange-looking for ordinary people to call her pretty, and so odd in\nher behavior, so full of tricks, that I did not love her. She was a\nsilent child, and liked to be alone. But whoever had the charge of her\nmust be watchful. She tasted everything, and burnt everything, within\nher reach. A blazing fire was too strong a temptation to be resisted.\nThe disappearance of all loose articles was ascribed to her; but\nnothing was said about it, for punishment made her more impish and\ndaring in her pursuits. She had a habit of frightening us by hiding,\nand appearing from places where no one had thought of looking for her.\nPeople shook their heads when they observed her. The Morgesons smiled\nsignificantly when she was spoken of, and asked:\n\n\"Do you think she is like her mother?\"\n\nThere was a conflict in mother's mind respecting Veronica. She did not\nlove her as she loved me; but strove the harder to fulfill her duty.\nWhen Verry suffered long and mysterious illnesses, which made her\nhelpless for weeks, she watched her day and night, but rarely caressed\nher. At other times Verry was left pretty much to herself and her\nways, which were so separate from mine that I scarcely saw her. We\ngrew up ignorant of each other's character, though Verry knew me\nbetter than I knew her; in time I discovered that she had closely\nobserved me, when I was most unaware.\n\nWe began to prosper about this time.\n\n\"Old Locke Morgeson had a long head,\" people said, when they talked\nof our affairs. Father profited by his grandfather's plans, and\nhis means, too; less visionary, he had modified and brought out\npractically many of his projections. Old Locke had left little to his\nson John Morgeson, in the belief that father was the man to carry out\nhis ideas. Besides money, he left him a tract of ground running north\nand south, a few rods beyond the old house, and desired him to build\nupon it. This he was now doing, and we expected to move into our new\nhouse before autumn.\n\nAll the Morgesons wished to put money in a company, as soon as father\ncould prove that it would be profitable. They were ready to own shares\nin the ships which he expected to build, when it was certain that\nthey would make lucky voyages. He declined their offers, but they all\n\"knuckled\" to the man who had been bold enough to break the life-long\nstagnation of Surrey, and approved his plans as they matured. His mind\nwas filled with the hope of creating a great business which should\nimprove Surrey. New streets had been cut through his property and that\nof grandfather, who, narrow as he was, could not resist the popular\nspirit; lots had been laid out, and cottages had gone up upon them. To\nmatters of minor importance father gave little heed; his domestic life\nwas fast becoming a habit. The constant enlargement of his schemes was\nalready a necessary stimulant.\n\nI did not go back to Mrs. Desire's school. Mother said that I must be\nuseful at home. She sent me to Temperance, and Temperance sent me to\nplay, or told me to go \"a visitin'.\" I did not care to visit, for in\nconsequence of being turned out of school, which was considered an\nindelible disgrace and long remembered, my schoolmates regarded me in\nthe light of a Pariah, and put on insufferably superior airs when they\nsaw me. So, like Veronica, I amused myself, and passed days on the\nsea-shore, or in the fields and woods, mother keeping me in long\nenough to make a square of patchwork each day and to hear her read\na Psalm--a duty which I bore with patience, by guessing when the\n\"Selahs\" would come in, and counting them. But wherever I was, or\nwhatever I did, no feeling of beauty ever stole into my mind. I never\nturned my face up to the sky to watch the passing of a cloud, or mused\nbefore the undulating space of sea, or looked down upon the earth with\nthe curiosity of thought, or spiritual aspiration. I was moved and\ngoverned by my sensations, which continually changed, and passed\naway--to come again, and deposit vague ideas which ignorantly haunted\nme. The literal images of all things which I saw were impressed on my\nshapeless mind, to be reproduced afterward by faculties then latent.\nBut what satisfaction was that? Doubtless the ideal faculty was\nactive in Veronica from the beginning; in me it was developed by the\nexperience of years. No remembrance of any ideal condition comes with\nthe remembrance of my childish days, and I conclude that my mind, if I\nhad any, existed in so rudimental a state that it had little influence\nupon my character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nOne afternoon in the following July, tired of walking in the mown\nfields, and of carrying a nest of mice, which I had discovered under\na hay-rick, I concluded I would begin a system of education with them;\nso arranging them on a grape-leaf, I started homeward. Going in by the\nkitchen, I saw Temperance wiping the dust from the best china, which\nelated me, for it was a sign that we were going to have company to\ntea.\n\n\"You evil child,\" she said, \"where have you been? Your mother has\nwanted you these hours, to dress you in your red French calico with\nwings to it. Some of the members are coming to tea; Miss Seneth\nJellatt, and she that was Clarissa Tripp, Snow now, and Miss Sophrony\nG. Dexter, and more besides.\"\n\nI put my mice in a basket, and begged Temperance to allow me to finish\nwiping the china; she consented, adjuring me not to let it fall. \"Mis\nMorgeson would die if any of it should be broken.\" I adored it, too.\nEach piece had a peach, or pear, or a bunch of cherries painted on it,\nin lustrous brown. The handles were like gold cords, and the covers\nhad knobs of gilt grapes.\n\n\"What preserves are you going to put on the table?\" I asked.\n\n\"Them West Ingy things Capen Curtis's son brought home, and quartered\nquince, though I expect Mis Dexter will remark that the surup is\nropy.\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't have cheese.\"\n\n\"We _must_ have cheese,\" she said solemnly. \"I expect they'll drink\nour green tea till they make bladders of themselves, it is so good.\nYour father is a first-rate man; he is an excellent provider, and\nany woman ought to be proud of him, for he does buy number one in\nprovisions.\"\n\nI looked at her with admiration and respect.\n\n\"Capen Curtis,\" she continued, pursuing a train of thought which the\npreserves had started, \"will never come home, I guess. He has been in\nfuren parts forever and a day; his wife has looked for him, a-twirling\nher thumb and fingers, every day for ten years. I heard your mother\nhad engaged her to go in the new house; she'll take the upper hand of\nus all. Your grandfather, Mr. John Morgeson, is willing to part with\nher; tired of her, I spose. She has been housekeeping there, off\nand on, these thirty years. She's fifty, if she is a day, is Hepsy\nCurtis.\"\n\n\"Is she as stingy as you are?\" I asked.\n\n\"You'll find out for yourself, Miss. I rather think you won't be\nallowed to crumble over the buttery shelves.\"\n\nI finished the cup, and was watching her while she grated loaf-sugar\nover a pile of doughnuts, when mother entered, and begged me to come\nupstairs with her to be dressed.\n\n\"Where is Verry, mother?\"\n\n\"In the parlor, with a lemon in one hand and Robinson Crusoe in the\nother. She will be good, she says. Cassy, you won't teaze me to-day,\nwill you?\"\n\n\"No, indeed, mother,\" and clapping my hands, \"I like you too well.\"\n\nShe laughed.\n\n\"These Morgesons beat the dogs,\" I heard Temperance say, as we shut\nthe door and went upstairs.\n\nI skipped over the shiny, lead-colored floor of the chamber in my\nstockings, while mother was taking from the bureau a clean suit for\nme, and singing \"Bonny Doon,\" with the sweetest voice in the world.\nShe soon arrayed me in my red calico dress, spotted with yellow stars.\nI was proud of its buckram undersleeves, though they scratched my\narms, and admired its wings, which extended over the protecting\nbuckram.\n\n\"It is three o'clock; the company will come soon. Be careful of your\ndress. You must stand by me at the table to hand the cups of tea.\"\n\nShe left me standing in a chair, so that I might see my pantalettes in\nthe high-hung glass, and the effect of my balloon-like sleeves. Then\nI went back to the kitchen to show myself to Temperance, and to enjoy\nthe progress of tea.\n\nThe table was laid in the long keeping-room adjoining the kitchen,\ncovered with a striped cloth of crimson and blue, smooth as satin to\nthe touch. Temperance had turned the plates upside-down around the\ntable, and placed in a straight line through the middle a row of\nedibles. She was going to have waffles, she said, and shortcake; they\nwere all ready to bake, and she wished to the Lord they would come and\nhave it over with. With the silver sugar-tongs I slyly nipped lumps\nof sugar for my private eating, and surveyed my features in the\ndistorting mirror of the pot-bellied silver teapot, ordinarily laid up\nin flannel. When the company had arrived, Temperance advised me to go\nin the parlor.\n\n\"Sit down, when you get there, and show less,\" she said. I went in\nsoftly, and stood behind mother's chair, slightly abashed for a moment\nin the presence of the party--some eight or ten ladies, dressed\nin black levantine, or cinnamon-colored silks, who were seated in\nrocking-chairs, all the rocking-chairs in the house having been\ncarried to the parlor for the occasion. They were knitting, and every\none had a square velvet workbag. Most of them wore lace caps, trimmed\nwith white satin ribbon. They were larger, more rotund, and older than\nmother, whose appearance struck me by contrast. Perhaps it was the\nfirst time I observed her dress; her face I must have studied before,\nfor I knew all her moods by it. Her long, lusterless, brown hair was\ntwisted around a high-topped tortoise-shell comb; it was so heavy and\nso carelessly twisted that the comb started backward, threatening\nto fall out. She had minute rings of filigreed gold in her ears.\nHer dress was a gray pongee, simply made and short; I could see her\nround-toed morocco shoes, tied with black ribbon. She usually took\nout her shoestrings, not liking the trouble of tying them. A ruffle of\nfine lace fell around her throat, and the sleeves of her short-waisted\ndress were puffed at the shoulders. Her small white hands were folded\nin her lap, for she was idle; on the little finger of her left hand\ntwinkled a brilliant garnet ring, set with diamonds. Her face was\ncolorless, the forehead extremely low, the nose and mouth finely cut,\nthe eyes of heavenly blue. Although youth had gone, she was beautiful,\nwith an indescribable air of individuality. She influenced all who\nwere near her; her atmosphere enveloped them. She was not aware of it,\nbeing too indifferent to the world to observe what effect she had\nin it, and only realized that she was to herself a self-tormentor.\nWhether she attracted or repelled, the power was the same. I make no\nattempt to analyze her character. I describe her as she appeared,\nand as my memory now holds her. I never understood her, and for that\nreason she attracted my attention. I felt puzzled now, she seemed\nso different from anybody else. My observation was next drawn to\nVeronica, who, entirely at home, walked up and down the room in a\nblue cambric dress. She was twisting in her fingers a fine gold\nchain, which hung from her neck. I caught her cunning glance as she\nflourished some tansy leaves before her face, imitating Mrs. Dexter to\nthe life. I laughed, and she came to me.\n\n\"See,\" she said softly, \"I have something from heaven.\" She lifted her\nwhite apron, and I saw under it, pinned to her dress, a splendid black\nbutterfly, spotted with red and gold.\n\n\"It is mine,\" she said, \"you shall not touch it. God blew it in\nthrough the window; but it has not breathed yet.\"\n\n\"Pooh; I have three mice in the kitchen.\"\n\n\"Where is the mother?\"\n\n\"In the hayrick, I suppose, I left it there.\"\n\n\"I hate you,\" she said, in an enraged voice. \"I would strike you, if\nit wasn't for this holy butterfly.\"\n\n\"Cassandra,\" said Mrs. Dexter, \"does look like her pa; the likeness is\nex-tri-ordinary. They say my William resembles me; but parients are no\njudges.\"\n\nA faint murmur rose from the knitters, which signified agreement with\nher remark.\n\n\"I do think,\" she continued, \"that it is high time Dr. Snell had a\ncolleague; he has outlived his usefulness. I never could say that\nI thought he was the right kind of man for our congregation; his\nprincipals as a man I have nothing to say against; but _why_ don't we\nhave revivals?\"\n\nWhen Mrs. Dexter wished to be elegant she stepped out of the\nvernacular. She was about to speak again when the whole party broke\ninto a loud talk on the subject she had started, not observing\nTemperance, who appeared at the door, and beckoned to mother. I\nfollowed her out.\n\n\"The members are goin' it, ain't they?\" she said. \"Do see if things\nare about right, Mis Morgeson.\" Mother made a few deviations from the\nstraight lines in which Temperance had ranged the viands, and told her\nto put the tea on the tray, and the chairs round the table.\n\n\"There's no place for Mr. Morgeson,\" observed Temperance.\n\n\"He is in Milford,\" mother replied.\n\n\"The brethren wont come, I spose, till after dark?\"\n\n\"I suppose not.\"\n\n\"Glad to get rid of their wives' clack, I guess.\"\n\nFrom the silence which followed mother's return to the parlor, I\nconcluded they were performing the ancient ceremony of waiting for\nsome one to go through the doorway first. They came at last with an\nair of indifference, as if the idea of eating had not yet occurred,\nand delayed taking seats till mother urged it; then they drew up to\nthe table, hastily, turned the plates right-side up, spread large silk\nhandkerchiefs over their laps, and, with their eyes fixed on space,\npreserved a dead silence, which was only broken by mother's inquiries\nabout their taste in milk or sugar. Temperance came in with plates\nof waffles and buttered shortcake, which she offered with a cut and\nthrust air, saying, as she did so, \"I expect you can't eat them; I\nknow they are tough.\"\n\nEverybody, however, accepted both. She then handed round the\npreserves, and went out to bake more waffles.\n\nBy this time the cups had circled the table, but no one had tasted a\nmorsel.\n\n\"Do help yourselves,\" mother entreated, whereat they fell upon the\nwaffles.\n\n\"Temperance is as good a cook as ever,\" said one; \"she is a prize,\nisn't she, Mis Morgeson?\"\n\n\"She is faithful and industrious,\" mother replied.\n\nAll began at once on the subject of help, and were as suddenly\nquenched by the reappearance of Temperance, with fresh waffles, and a\ndish of apple-fritters.\n\n\"Do eat these if you can, ladies; the apples are only russets, and\nthey are kinder dead for flavoring. I see you don't eat a mite; I\nexpected you could not; it's poor trash.\" And she passed the cake\nalong, everybody taking a piece of each kind.\n\nAfter drinking a good many cups of tea, and praising it, their\nasceticism gave way to its social effect, and they began to gossip,\nridiculing their neighbors, and occasionally launching innuendoes\nagainst their absent lords. It is well known that when women meet\ntogether they do not discuss their rights, but take them, in revealing\nthe little weaknesses and peculiarities of their husbands. The worst\nwife-driver would be confounded at the air of easy superiority assumed\non these occasions by the meekest and most unsuspicious of her sex.\nInsinuations of So and So's not being any better than she should\nbe passed from mouth to mouth, with a glance at me; and I heard the\nproverb of \"Little pitchers,\" when mother rose suddenly from the\ntable, and led the way to the parlor.\n\n\"Where is Veronica?\" asked Temperance, who was piling the debris\nof the feast. \"She has been in mischief, I'll warrant; find her,\nCassandra.\"\n\nShe was upstairs putting away her butterfly, in the leaves of her\nlittle Bible. She came down with me, and Temperance coaxed her to eat\nher supper, by vowing that she should be sick abed, unless she\nliked her fritters and waffles. I thought of my mice, while making\na desultory meal standing, and went to look at them; they were gone.\nWondering if Temperance had thrown the creatures away, I remembered\nthat I had been foolish enough to tell Veronica, and rushed back to\nher. When she saw me, she raised a saucer to her face, pretending to\ndrink from it.\n\n\"Verry, where are the mice?\"\n\n\"Are they gone?\"\n\n\"Tell me.\"\n\n\"What will you do if I don't?\"\n\n\"I know,\" and I flew upstairs, tore the poor butterfly from between\nthe leaves of the Bible, crushed it in my hand, and brought it down to\nher. She did not cry when she saw it, but choked a little, and turned\naway her head.\n\nIt was now dark, and hearing a bustle in the entry I looked out, and\nsaw several staid men slowly rubbing their feet on the door-mat; the\nhusbands had come to escort their wives home, and by nine o'clock they\nall went. Veronica and I stayed by the door after they had gone.\n\n\"Look at Mrs. Dexter,\" she said; \"I put the mice in her workbag.\"\n\nI burst into a laugh, which she joined in presently.\n\n\"I am sorry about the butterfly, Verry.\" And I attempted to take her\nhand, but she pushed me away, and marched off whistling.\n\nA few days after this, sitting near the window at twilight, intent\nupon a picture in a book of travels, of a Hindoo swinging from a high\npole with hooks in his flesh, and trying to imagine how much it\nhurt him, my attention was arrested by a mention of my name in a\nconversation held between mother and Mr. Park, one of the neighbors.\nHe occasionally spent an evening at our house, passing it in polemical\ndiscussion, revising the prayers and exhortations which he made at\nconference meetings. The good man was a little vain of having the\nformulas of his creed at his tongue's end. She sometimes lost the\nthread of his discourse, but argued also as if to convince herself\nthat she could rightly distinguish between Truth and Illusion, but\nnever discussed religious topics with father. Like all the Morgesons,\nhe was Orthodox, accepting what had been provided by others for his\nspiritual accommodation. He thought it well that existing Institutions\nshould not be disturbed. \"Something worse might be established\ninstead.\" His turn of mind, in short, was not Evangelical.\n\n\"Are the Hindoos in earnest, mother?\" and I thrust the picture before\nher. She warned me off.\n\n\"Do you think, Mr. Park, that Cassandra can understand the law of\ntransgression?\"\n\nAn acute perception that it was in my power to escape a moral penalty,\nby willful ignorance, was revealed to me, that I could continue the\nprivilege of sinning with impunity. His answer was complicated, and\nhe quoted several passages from the Scriptures. Presently he began to\nsing, and I grew lonesome; the life within me seemed a black cave.\n\n    \"_Our nature's totally depraved--\n      The heart a sink of sin;\n    Without a change we can't be saved,\n      Ye must be born again_.\"\n\nTemperance opened the door. \"Is Veronica going to bed to-night?\" she\nasked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nThe next September we moved. Our new house was large and handsome. On\nthe south side there was nothing between it and the sea, except a few\nfeet of sand. No tree or shrub intercepted the view. To the eastward a\npromontory of rocks jutted into the sea, serving as a pier against\nthe wash of the tide, and adding a picturesqueness to the curve of the\nbeach. On the north side flourished an orchard, which was planted by\nGrandfather Locke. Looking over the tree-tops from the upper north\nwindows, one would have had no suspicion of being in the neighborhood\nof the sea. From these windows, in winter, we saw the nimbus of the\nNorthern Light. The darkness of our sky, the stillness of the night,\nmysteriously reflected the perpetual condition of its own solitary\nworld. In summer ragged white clouds rose above the horizon, as if\nthey had been torn from the sky of an underworld, to sail up the\nblue heaven, languish away, or turn livid with thunder, and roll off\nseaward. Between the orchard and the house a lawn sloped easterly to\nthe border of a brook, which straggled behind the outhouses into a\nmeadow, and finally lost itself among the rocks on the shore. Up by\nthe lawn a willow hung over it, and its outer bank was fringed by\nthe tangled wild-grape, sweet-briar, and alder bushes. The premises,\nexcept on the seaside, were enclosed by a high wall of rough granite.\nNo houses were near us, on either side of the shore; up the north road\nthey were scattered at intervals.\n\nMother said I must be considered a young lady, and should have my own\nroom. Veronica was to have one opposite, divided from it by a wide\npassage. This passage extended beyond the angle of the stairway, and\nwas cut off by a glass door. A wall ran across the lower end of the\npassage; half the house was beyond its other side, so that when the\ndoor was fastened, Veronica and myself were in a cul-de-sac.\n\nThe establishment was put on a larger footing. Mrs. Hepsey Curtis was\ninstalled mistress of the kitchen. Temperance declared that she could\nnot stand it; that she wasn't a nigger; that she must go, but she had\nno home, and no friends--nothing but a wood lot, which was left her\nby her father the miller. As the trees thereon grew, promising to make\ntimber, its value increased; at present her income was limited to the\nprofit from the annual sale of a cord or two of wood. So she staid on,\nin spite of Hepsey. There were also two men for the garden and stable.\nA boy was always attached to the house; not the same boy, but a Boy\ndynasty, for as soon as one went another came, who ate a great deal--a\ncrime in Hepsey's eyes--and whose general duty was to carry armfuls of\nwood, pails of milk, or swill, and to shut doors.\n\nWe had many visitors. Though father had no time to devote to guests,\nhe was continually inviting people for us to entertain, and his\ninvitations were taken as a matter of course, and finally for granted.\nA rich Morgeson was a new feature in the family annals, and distant\nrelations improved the advantage offered them by coming to spend the\nsummer with us, because their own houses were too hot, or the winter,\nbecause they were too cold! Infirm old ladies, who were not related to\nus, but who had nowhere else to visit, came. As his business extended,\nour visiting list extended. The captains of his ships whose homes were\nelsewhere brought their wives to be inconsolable with us after their\ndeparture on their voyages. We had ministers often, who always quarter\nat the best houses, and chance visitors to dinner and supper, who made\nour house a way-station. There was but small opportunity to cultivate\nfamily affinities; they were forever disturbed. Somebody was always\nsitting in the laps of our Lares and Penates. Another class of\nvisitors deserving notice were those who preferred to occupy the\nkitchen and back chambers, humbly proud and bashfully arrogant people,\nwho kept their hats and bonnets by them, and small bundles, to delude\nthemselves and us with the idea that they \"had not come to stay, and\nhad no occasion for any attention.\" These people criticised us\nwith insinuating severity, and proposed amendments with unrelenting\naffability. To this class Veronica was most attracted--it repelled me;\nconsequently she was petted, and I was amiably sneered at.\n\nThis period of our family life has left small impression of dramatic\ninterest. There was no development of the sentiments, no betrayal of\nthe fluctuations of the passions which must have existed. There was\nno accident to reveal, no coincidence to surprise us. Hidden among\nthe Powers That Be, which rule New England, lurks the Deity of the\nIllicit. This Deity never obtained sovereignty in the atmosphere\nwhere the Morgesons lived. Instead of the impression which my\nafter-experience suggests to me to seek, I recall arrivals and\ndepartures, an eternal smell of cookery, a perpetual changing of beds,\nand the small talk of vacant minds.\n\nDespite the rigors of Hepsey in the kitchen, and the careful\nsupervision of Temperance, there was little systematic housekeeping.\nMother had severe turns of planning, and making rules, falling upon\nus in whirlwinds of reform, shortly allowing the band of habit to snap\nback, and we resumed our former condition. She had no assistance from\nfather in her ideas of change. It was enough for him to know that he\nhad built a good house to shelter us, and to order the best that could\nbe bought for us to eat and to wear. He liked, when he went where\nthere were fine shops, to buy and bring home handsome shawls, bonnets,\nand dresses, wholly unsuited in general to the style and taste of each\nof us, but much handsomer than were needful for Surrey. They answered,\nhowever, as patterns for the plainer materials of our neighbors. He\nalso bought books for us, recommended by their covers, or the opinion\nof the bookseller. His failing was to buy an immense quantity of\neverything he fancied.\n\n\"I shall never have to buy this thing again,\" he would say; \"let us\nhave enough.\"\n\nVeronica and I grew up ignorant of practical or economical ways. We\nnever saw money, never went shopping. Mother was indifferent in regard\nto much of the business of ordinary life which children are taught to\nunderstand. Father and mother both stopped at the same point with us,\nbut for a different reason; father, because he saw nothing beyond the\nmaterial, and mother, because her spiritual insight was confused and\nperplexing. But whatever a household may be, the Destinies spin the\nweb to their will, put of the threads which drop hither and thither,\nfloating in its atmosphere, white, black, or gray.\n\nFrom the time we moved, however, we were a stirring, cheerful family,\nindependent of each other, but spite of our desultory tastes, mutual\nhabits were formed. When the want of society was felt, we sought the\ndining-room, sure of meeting others with the same want. This room was\nlarge and central, connecting with the halls, kitchen, and mother's\nroom. It was a caravansary where people dropped in and out on\ntheir way to some other place. Our most public moments were during\nmeal-time. It was known that father was at home at breakfast and\nsupper, and could be consulted. As he was away at our noonday dinner,\ngenerally we were the least disturbed then, and it was a lawless,\nirregular, and unceremonious affair. Mother establisher her arm-chair\nhere, and a stand for her workbasket. Hepsey and Temperance were at\nhand, the men came for orders, and it was convenient for the boy to\ntransmit the local intelligence it was his vocation to collect. The\nwindows commanded a view of the sea, the best in the house. This\nprospect served mother for exercise. Her eyes roved over it when she\nwanted a little out-of-doors life. If she desired more variety, which\nwas seldom, she went to the kitchen. After we moved she grew averse\nto leaving the house, except to go to church. She never quitted the\ndining-room after our supper till bedtime, because father rarely came\nfrom Milford, where he went on bank days, and indeed almost every\nother day, till late, and she liked to be by him while he ate his\nsupper and smoked a cigar. All except Veronica frequented this room;\nbut she was not missed or inquired for. She liked the parlor, because\nthe piano was there. As soon as father had bought it she astonished us\nby a persistent fingering of the keys, which produced a feeble melody.\nShe soon played all the airs she had heard. When I saw what she could\ndo, I refused to take music lessons, for while I was trying to\nlearn \"The White Cockade,\" she pushed me away, played it, and made\nvariations upon it. I pounded the keys with my fist, by way of a\nfarewell, and told her she should have the piano for her own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nOne winter morning before daylight, Veronica came to my room, and\nasked me if I had heard any walking about the house during the night.\nShe had, and was going to inquire about it. She soon returned with,\n\"You have a brother. Temperance says my nose is broken. He will be\nlike you, I suppose, and have everything he asks for. I don't care\nfor him; but,\" crying out with passion, \"get up. Mother wants to see\n_you_, I know.\"\n\nI dressed quickly, and went downstairs with a feeling of indignation\nthat such an event should have happened without my knowledge.\n\nThere was an unwonted hush. A bright fire was burning on the\ndining-room hearth, the lamps were still lighted, and father was by\nthe fire, smoking in a meditative manner. He put out his hand, which I\ndid not take, and said, \"Do you like his name--Arthur?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I mumbled, as I passed him, and went to the kitchen, where\nHepsey and Temperance were superintending the steeping of certain\naromatic herbs, which stood round the fire in silver porringers and\nearthen pitchers.\n\n\"Another Morgeson's come,\" said Temperance. \"There's enough of them,\nsuch as they are--not but what they are good enough,\" correcting\nherself hastily.\n\n\"Go into your mother's room, softly,\" said Hepsey, rubbing her fingers\nagainst her thumb--her habit when she was in a tranquil frame of mind.\n\n\"_You_ are mighty glad, Hepsey,\" said Temperance.\n\n\"Locke Morgeson ought to have a son,\" she replied, \"to leave his money\nto.\"\n\n\"I vow,\" answered Temperance, \"girls are thought nothing of in this\n'ligous section; they may go to the poor house, as long as the sons\nhave plenty.\"\n\nAn uncommon fit or shyness seized me, mixed with a feeling of dread,\nas I crept into the room where mother was. My eyes first fell upon\nan elderly woman, who wore a long, wide, black apron, whose strings\ngirded the middle of her cushion-like form. She was taking snuff. It\nwas the widow Mehitable Allen, a lady whom I had often seen in other\nhouses on similar occasions.\n\n\"Shoo,\" she whispered nasally.\n\nI was arrested, but turned my eyes toward mother; hers were closed.\nPresently she murmured, \"Thank God,\" opened them, and saw me. A smile\nlighted her pale countenance. \"Cassy, my darling, kiss me. I am glad\nit is not a woman.\" As I returned her kiss her glance dropped on a\nsmall bunch by her side, which Mehitable took and deftly unrolled,\ninforming me as she did so that it was a \"Rouser.\"\n\nAunt Mercy came the next day. She had not paid us a visit in a long\ntime, being confined at home with the care of her father, Grandfather\nWarren. She took charge of Veronica and me, if taking charge means\na series of guerilla skirmishes on both sides. I soon discovered,\nhowever, that she was prone to laughter, and that I could provoke\nit; we got on better after that discovery; but Veronica, disdaining\nartifice, was very cross with her. Aunt Mercy had a spark of fun in\nher composition, which was not quite crushed out by her religious\neducation. She frequented the church oftener than mother, sang more\nhymns, attended all the anniversary celebrations, but she had no\ndreams, no enthusiasm. Her religion had leveled all needs and all\naspirations. What the day brought forth answered her. She inspired me\nwith a secret pity; for I knew she carried in her bosom the knowledge\nthat she was an old maid.\n\nBefore mother left her room Veronica was taken ill, and was not\nconvalescent till spring. Delicacy of constitution the doctor called\nher disorder. She had no strength, no appetite, and looked more elfish\nthan ever. She would not stay in bed, and could not sit up, so father\nhad a chair made for her, in which she could recline comfortably. Aunt\nMerce put her in it every morning, and took her out every evening. My\npresence irritated her, so I visited her but seldom. She said I looked\nso well, it hurt her, and wished me to keep out of her sight, begged\nme never to talk loud in the vicinity of her room, my voice was\nso breezy. She amused herself in her own strange way. One of her\namusements was to cut off her hair, lock by lock, and cut it short\nbefore she was well enough to walk about. She played on a jewsharp,\nand on a little fife when her breath permitted, and invented grotesque\ncostumes out of bits of silk and lace. Temperance was much engaged,\nat her dictation, in the composition of elaborate dishes, which she\nrarely ate, but forced Temperance to. She was more patient with her\nthan any other person; with us she was excessively high-tempered,\nespecially with father. She could not bear to catch a glimpse of the\nsea, nor to hear it; if she heard it echoing in the house, she played\non her fife, or jewsharp, or asked Aunt Merce to sing some old song.\nBut she liked the view from the north windows, even when the boughs\nwere bare and the fields barren. When the grass came, she ordered\nhandfuls to be brought her and put in saucers of water. With the\ncoming of the blossoms she began to mend. As for me, I was as much an\nanimal as ever--robust in health--inattentive, and seeking excitement\nand exhilaration. I went everywhere, to Bible class, to Sunday school,\nand to every funeral which took place within our precincts. But I\nnever looked upon the dead; perhaps that sight would have marred the\nslumbrous security which possessed me--the instinctive faith in the\ndurability of my own powers of life.\n\nBut a change was approaching. Aunt Merce considered my present state a\nhopeless one. She was outside the orbit of the family planet, and saw\nthe tendency of its revolutions, perceiving that father and mother\nwere absorbed in their individual affairs. She called mother's\nattention to my non-improvement, and proposed that I should return\nto Barmouth with her for a year, and become a pupil in a young lady's\nschool, which had been recently established there, by a graduate of\nthe Nipswich Female Seminary, a school distinguished for its ethics.\nMother looked astonished, when she heard this proposal. \"What!\" she\nbegan with vehemence, \"shall I subject\"--but checked herself when she\ncaught my eye, and continued more calmly: \"We will decide soon.\"\n\nIt was decided that I should go, without my being consulted in the\nmatter. I felt resentful against mother, and could not understand\ntill afterward, why she had consented to the plan. It was because she\nwished me to comprehend the influences of her early life, and learn\nsome of the lessons she had been taught. At first, father \"poohed\"\nat the plan, but finally said it was a good place to tame me. When\nVeronica heard that I was going, she told me that I would be stifled,\nif I lived at Grandfather Warren's; but added that the plums in his\ngarden were good, and advised me to sit on the yellow stone doorstep,\nunder which the toads lived. She also informed me that she was glad of\nit, and hoped I would stay forever.\n\nTo Barmouth I went, and in May entered Miss Black's genteel school.\nMiss Black had a conviction that her vocation was teaching. Necessity\ndid not compel it, for she was connected with one of the richest\nfamilies in Barmouth. At the end of the week my curiosity regarding my\nnew position was quenched, and I dropped into the depths of my first\nwretchedness. I frantically demanded of father, who had stopped to\nsee me on his way to Milford, to be taken home. He firmly resisted me.\nOnce a month, I should go home and spend a Sunday, if I chose, and he\nwould come to Barmouth every week.\n\nMy agitation and despair clouded his face for a moment, then it\ncleared, and pinching my chin, he said, \"Why don't you look like your\nmother?\"\n\n\"But she _is_ like her mother,\" said Aunt Merce.\n\n\"Well, Cassy, good-by\"; and he gave me a kiss with cruel nonchalance.\nI knew my year must be stayed out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nMy life at Grandfather Warren's was one kind of penance and my life\nin Miss Black's school another. Both differed from our home-life.\nMy filaments found no nourishment, creeping between the two; but\nthe fibers of youth are strong, and they do not perish. Grandfather\nWarren's house reminded me of the casket which imprisoned the Genii.\nI had let loose a Presence I had no power over--the embodiment of its\ngloom, its sternness, and its silence.\n\nWith feeling comes observation; after that, one reasons. I began to\nobserve. Aunt Mercy was not the Aunt Merce I had known at home. She\nwore a mask before her father. There was constraint between them;\neach repressed the other. The result of this relation was a formal,\npetrifying, unyielding system,--a system which, from the fact of its\nsatisfying neither, was kept up the more rigidly; on the one side\nfrom a morbid conscience, which reiterated its monitions against\nthe dictates of the natural heart; on the other, out of respect and\ntimidity.\n\nGrandfather Warren was a little, lean, leather-colored man. His head\nwas habitually bent, his eyes cast down; but when he raised them to\npeer about, their sharpness and clear intelligence gave his face\na wonderful vitality. He chafed his small, well-shaped hands\ncontinually; his long polished nails clicked together with a shelly\nnoise, like that which beetles make flying against the ceiling. His\nfeatures were delicate and handsome; gentle blood ran in his veins,\nas I have said. All classes in Barmouth treated him with invariable\ncourtesy. He was aboriginal in character, not to be moved by\nantecedent or changed by innovation--a Puritan, without gentleness or\ntenderness. He scarcely concealed his contempt for the emollients\nof life, or for those who needed them. He whined over no misfortune,\npined for no pleasure. His two sons, who broke loose from him, went\ninto the world, lived a wild, merry life, and died there, he never\nnamed. He found his wife dead by his side one morning. He did not go\nfrantic, but selected a text for the funeral sermon; and when he stood\nby the uncovered grave, took off his hat and thanked his friends for\ntheir kindness with a loud, steady voice. Aunt Mercy told me that\nafter her mother's death his habit of chafing his hands commenced;\nit was all the difference she saw in him, for he never spoke of his\ntrouble or acknowledged his grief by sign or word.\n\nThough he had been frugal and industrious all his life, he had no more\nproperty than the old, rambling house we lived in, and a long, narrow\ngarden attached to it, where there were a few plum and quince trees, a\nrow of currant bushes, Aunt Mercy's beds of chamomile and sage, and a\nfew flowers. At the end of the garden was a peaked-roof pigsty; it\nwas cleanly kept, and its inhabitant had his meals served with the\nregularity which characterized all that Grandfather Warren did.\nBeautiful pigeons lived in the roof, and were on friendly terms with\nthe occupant on the lower floor. The house was not unpicturesque. It\nwas built on a corner, facing two streets. One front was a story high,\nwith a slanting roof; the other, which was two-storied, sloped like\na giraffe's back, down to a wood-shed. Clean cobwebs hung from its\nrafters, and neat heaps of fragrant chips were piled on the floor.\n\nThe house had many rooms, all more or less dark and irregularly\nshaped. The construction of the chambers was so involved, I could\nnot get out of one without going into another. Some of the ceilings\nslanted suddenly, and some so gradually that where I could stand\nerect, and where I must stoop, I never remembered, until my head\nwas unpleasantly grazed, or my eyes filled with flakes of ancient\nlime-dust. A long chamber in the middle of the house was the shop,\nalways smelling of woolen shreds. At sunset, summer or winter, Aunt\nMercy sprinkled water on the unpainted floor, and swept it. While she\nswept I made my thumb sore, by snipping the bits of cloth that were\nscattered on the long counter by the window with Grand'ther's shears,\nor I scrawled figures with gray chalk, where I thought they might\ncatch his eye. When she had finished sweeping she carefully sorted\nthe scraps, and put them into boxes under the counter; then she neatly\nrolled up the brown-paper curtains, which had been let down to\nexclude the afternoon sun; shook the old patchwork cushions in the\nosier-bottomed chairs; watered the rose-geranium and the monthly rose,\nwhich flourished wonderfully in that fluffy atmosphere; set every pin\nand needle in its place, and shut the door, which was opened again at\nsunrise. Of late years, Grand'ther's occupation had declined. No new\ncustomers came. A few, who did not change the fashion of their garb,\nstill patronized him. His income was barely three hundred dollars a\nyear--eked out to this amount by some small pay for offices connected\nwith the church, of which he was a prominent member. From this income\nhe paid his pulpit tithe, gave to the poor, and lived independent and\nrespectable. Mother endeavored in an unobtrusive way to add to his\ncomfort; but he would only accept a few herrings from the Surrey\nWeir every spring, and a basket of apples every fall. He invariably\nreturned her presents by giving her a share of his plums and quinces.\n\nI had only seen Grand'ther Warren at odd intervals. He rarely came\nto our house; when he did, he rode down on the top of the Barmouth\nstagecoach, returning in a few hours. As mother never liked to go to\nBarmouth, she seldom came to see me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nIt was five o'clock on Saturday afternoon when father left me. Aunt\nMercy continued her preparations for tea, and when it was ready, went\nto the foot of the stairs, and called, \"Supper.\" Grand'ther came down\nimmediately followed by two tall, cadaverous women, Ruth and Sally\nAikin, tailoresses, who sewed for him spring and fall. Living several\nmiles from Barmouth, they stayed through the week, going home on\nSaturday night, to return on Monday morning. We stood behind the heavy\noak chairs round the table, one of which Grand'ther tipped backward,\nand said a long grace, not a word of which was heard; for his teeth\nwere gone, and he prayed in his throat. Aunt Mercy's \"Moltee\" rubbed\nagainst me, with her back and tail erect. I pinched the latter, and\nshe gave a wail. Aunt Mercy passed her hand across her mouth, but the\neyes of the two women were stony in their sockets. Grand'ther ended\nhis grace with an upward jerk of his head as we seated ourselves.\nHe looked sharply at me, his gray eyebrows rising hair by hair,\nand shaking a spoon at me said, \"You are playing over your mother's\ncapers.\"\n\n\"The caper-bush grows on the shores of the Mediterranean sea,\nGrand'ther. Miss Black had it for a theme, out of the _Penny\nMagazine_; it is full of themes.\"\n\n\"She had better give you a gospel theme.\"\n\nHe was as inarticulate when he quoted Scripture as when he prayed, but\nI heard something about \"thorns\"; then he helped us to baked Indian\npudding--our invariable Saturday night's repast. Aunt Mercy passed\ncups of tea; I heard the gulping swallow of it in every throat, the\nsilence was so profound. After the pudding we had dried apple-pie,\nwhich we ate from our hands, like bread. Grand'ther ate fast, not\ntroubling himself to ask us if we would have more, but making the\nnecessary motions to that effect by touching the spoon in the pudding\nor knife on the pie. Ruth and Sally still kept their eyes fixed on\nsome invisible object at a distance. What a disagreeable interest I\nfelt in them! What had they in common with me? What could they enjoy?\nHow unpleasant their dingy, crumbled, needle-pricked fingers were!\nSally hiccoughed, and Ruth suffered from internal rumblings. Without\nwaiting for each other when we had finished, we put our chairs against\nthe wall and left the room. I rushed into the garden and trampled the\nchamomile bed. I had heard that it grew faster for being subjected\nto that process, and thought of the two women I had just seen while I\ncrushed the spongy plants. Had _they_ been trampled upon? A feeling\nof pity stung me; I ran into the house, and found them on the point of\ndeparture, with little bundles in their hands.\n\n\"Aunt Mercy will let me carry your bundles a part of the way for you;\nshall I?\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said Ruth, in a mild voice; \"there's no heft in them;\nthey are mites to carry.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" chimed Sally, \"you couldn't be trusted with them.\"\n\n\"Are they worth anything?\" I inquired, noticing then that both wore\nbetter dresses, and that the bundles contained their shop-gowns.\n\n\"What made you pinch the moltee's tail?\" asked Sally. \"If you pinched\nmy cat's tail, I would give you a sound whipping.\"\n\n\"How could she, Sally,\" said Ruth, \"when our cat's tail is cut short\noff?\"\n\n\"For all the world,\" remarked Sally, \"that's the only way she can\nbe managed. If things are cut off, and kept out of sight, or never\nmentioned before her, she may behave very well; not otherwise.\"\n\n\"Good-by, Miss Ruth, and Sally, good-by,\" modulating my voice to\naccents of grief, and making a \"cheese.\"\n\nThey retreated with a less staid pace than usual, and I sought Aunt\nMercy, who was preparing the Sunday's dinner. Twilight drew near, and\nthe Sunday's clouds began to fall on my spirits. Between sundown and\nnine o'clock was a tedious interval. I was not allowed to go to bed,\nnor to read a secular book, or to amuse myself with anything. A dim\noil-lamp burned on the high shelf of the middle room, our ordinary\ngathering-place. Aunt Mercy sat there, rocking in a low chair; the\ndoors were open, and I wandered softly about. The smell of the\ngarden herbs came in faintly, and now and then I heard a noise in\nthe water-butt under the spout, the snapping of an old rafter, or\nsomething falling behind the wall. The toads crawled from under the\nplantain leaves, and hopped across the broad stone before the kitchen\ndoor, and the irreverent cat, with whom I sympathized, raced like mad\nin the grass. Growing duller, I went to the cellar door, which was in\nthe front entry, opened it, and stared down in the black gulf, till\nI saw a gray rock rise at the foot of the stairs which affected my\nimagination. The foundation of the house was on the spurs of a great\ngranite bed, which rose from the Surrey shores, dipped and cropped\nout in the center of Barmouth. It came through the ground again in the\nwoodhouse, smooth and round, like the bald head of some old Titan, and\nin the border of the garden it burst through in narrow ridges full\nof seams. As I contemplated the rock, and inhaled a moldy atmosphere\nwhose component parts were charcoal and potatoes, I heard the first\nstroke of the nine o'clock bell, which hung in the belfry of the\nchurch across the street. Although it was so near us that we could\nhear the bellrope whistle in its grooves, and its last hoarse breath\nin the belfry, there was no reverberation of its clang in the house;\nthe rock under us struck back its voice. It was an old Spanish bell,\nAunt Mercy told me. How it reached Barmouth she did not know. I\nrecognized its complaining voice afterward. It told me it could never\nforget it had been baptized a Catholic; and it pined for the beggar\nwho rang it in the land of fan-leaved chestnuts! It would growl and\nstrangle as much as possible in the hands of Benjamin Beals, the\nbell-ringer and coffin-maker of Barmouth. Except in the morning when\nit called me up, I was glad to hear it. It was the signal of time\npast; the oftener I heard it, the nearer I was to the end of my year.\nBefore it ceased to ring now Aunt Mercy called me in a low voice. I\nreturned to the middle room, and took a seat in one of the oak chairs,\nwhose back of upright rods was my nightly penance. Aunt Mercy took the\nlamp from the shelf, and placed it upon a small oak stand, where\nthe Bible lay. Grand'ther entered, and sitting by the stand read a\nchapter. His voice was like opium. Presently my head rolled across the\nrods, and I felt conscious of slipping down the glassy seat. After\nhe had read the chapter he prayed. If the chapter had been long, the\nprayer was short; if the chapter had been short, the prayer was long.\nWhen he had ceased praying, he left the room without speaking, and\nbetook himself to bed. Aunt Mercy dragged me up the steep stairs,\nundressed me, and I crept into bed, drugged with a monotony which\nserved but to deepen the sleep of youth and health. When the bell rang\nthe next morning, Aunt Mercy gave me a preparatory shake before she\nbegan to dress, and while she walked up and down the room lacing her\nstays entreated me to get up.\n\nIf the word lively could ever be used in reference to our life, it\nmight be in regard to Sunday. The well was so near the church that the\nhouse was used as an inn for the accommodation of the church-goers who\nlived at any distance, and who did not return home between the morning\nand afternoon services. A regular set took dinner with us, and\nthere were parties who brought lunch, which they ate off their\nhandkerchiefs, on their knees. It was also a watering-place for the\nSunday-school scholars, who filed in troops before the pail in the\nwell-room, and drank from the cocoanut dipper. When the weather was\nwarm our parlor was open, as it was to-day. Aunt Mercy had dusted it\nand ornamented the hearth with bunches of lilacs in a broken pitcher.\nTwelve yellow chairs, a mahogany stand, a dark rag-carpet, some\nspeckled Pacific sea-shells on the shelf, among which stood a whale's\ntooth with a drawing of a cranky ship thereon, and an ostrich's egg\nthat hung by a string from the ceiling, were the adornments of the\nroom. When we were dressed for church, we looked out of the window\ntill the bell tolled, and the chaise of the Baxters and Sawyers had\ndriven to the gate; then we went ourselves. Grand'ther had preceded\nus, and was already in his seat. Aunt Mercy went up to the head of the\npew, a little out of breath, from the tightness of her dress, and the\nordeal of the Baxter and Sawyer eyes, for the pew, though off a side\naisle, was in the neighborhood of the elite of the church; a clove,\nhowever, tranquilized her. I fixed my feet on a cricket, and examined\nthe bonnets. The house filled rapidly, and last of all the minister\nentered. The singers began an anthem, singing in an advanced style of\nthe art, I observed, for they shouted \"_Armen_,\" while our singers in\nSurrey bellowed \"_Amen_.\" When the sermon began I settled myself\ninto a vague speculation concerning my future days of freedom; but my\ndreams were disturbed by the conduct of the Hickspold boys, who were\nin a pew in front of us. As in the morning, so in the afternoon and\nall the Sundays in the year. The variations of the season served but\nto deepen the uniformity of my heartsickness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\nAunt Mercy had not introduced me to Miss Black as the daughter of\nLocke Morgeson, the richest man in Surrey, but simply as her niece.\nHer pride prevented her from making any exhibition of my antecedents,\nwhich was wise, considering that I had none. My grandfather,\nJohn Morgeson, was a nobody,--merely a \"Co.\"; and though my\ngreat-grandfather, Locke Morgeson, was worthy to be called a Somebody,\nit was not his destiny to make a stir in the world. Many of the\nfamilies of my Barmouth schoolmates had the fulcrum of a moneyed\ngrandfather. The knowledge of the girls did not extend to that period\nin the family history when its patriarchs started in the pursuit of\nGain. Elmira Sawyer, one of Miss Black's pupils, never heard that her\ngrandfather \"Black Peter,\" as he was called, had made excursions,\nin an earlier part of his life, on the River Congo, or that he was\nfamiliar with the soundings of Loango Bay. As he returned from his\nvoyages, bringing more and more money, he enlarged his estate, and\ngrew more and more respectable, retiring at last from the sea, to\nbecome a worthy landsman; he paid taxes to church and state, and\neven had a silver communion cup, among the pewter service used on\nthe occasion of the Lord's Supper; but he never was brought to\nthe approval of that project of the Congregational Churches,--the\ncolonization of the Blacks to Liberia. Neither was Hersila Allen aware\nthat the pink calico in which I first saw her was remotely owing to\nWest India Rum. Nor did Charlotte Alden, the proudest girl in school,\nknow that her grandfather's, Squire Alden's, stepping-stone to\nfortune was the loss of the brig _Capricorn_, which was wrecked in\nthe vicinity of a comfortable port, on her passage out to the\nwhaling-ground. An auger had been added to the meager outfit, and long\nafter the sea had leaked through the hole bored through her bottom,\nand swallowed her, and the insurance had been paid, the truth leaked\nout that the captain had received instructions, which had been\nfulfilled. Whereupon two Insurance Companies went to law with him, and\na suit ensued, which ended in their paying costs, in addition to what\nthey had before paid Squire Alden, who winked in a derisive manner at\nthe Board of Directors when he received its check.\n\nThere were others who belonged in the category of Decayed Families,\nas exclusive as they were shabby. There were parvenus, which included\nmyself. When I entered the school it was divided into clans, each\nwith its spites, jealousies, and emulations. Its _esprit de corps_,\nhowever, was developed by my arrival; the girls united against me, and\nthough I perceived, when I compared myself with them, that they were\npartly right in their opinions, their ridicule stupefied and crushed\nme. They were trained, intelligent, and adroit; I uncouth, ignorant,\nand without tact. It was impossible for Miss Black not to be affected\nby the general feeling in regard to me. Her pupils knew sooner than I\nthat she sympathized with them. She embarrassed me, when I should have\ndespised her. At first her regimen surprised, then filled me with a\ndumb, clouded anger, which made me appear apathetic.\n\nMiss Emily Black was a young woman, and, I thought, a handsome one.\nShe had crenelated black hair, large black eyes, a Roman nose,\nand long white teeth. She bit her nails when annoyed, and when her\nsuperiority made her perceive the mental darkness of others she often\nlaughed. Being pious, she conducted her school after the theologic\npattern of the Nipswich Seminary, at which she had been educated.\nShe opened the school each day with a religious exercise, reading\nsomething from the Bible, and commenting upon it, or questioning us\nregarding our ideas of what she read. She often selected the character\nof David, and was persistent in her efforts to explain and reconcile\nthe discrepancies in the history of the royal Son of Israel.\n\n\"Miss _C._ Morgeson, we will call you,\" she said, in our first\ninterview; \"the name of Cassandra is too peculiar.\"\n\n\"My Grandfather Locke liked the name; my sister's is Veronica; do you\nlike that better?\"\n\n\"It is of no consequence in the premises what your sister may be\nnamed,\" she replied, running her eyes over me. \"What will she study,\nMiss Warren?\"\n\nAunt Mercy's recollections of my studies were dim, and her knowledge\nof my school days was not calculated to prepossess a teacher in my\nfavor; but after a moment's delay, she said: \"What you think best.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" she answered; \"I will endeavor to fulfill my Christian\nduty toward her. We will return to the school-room.\"\n\nWe had held the conversation in the porch, and now Aunt Mercy gave me\na nod of encouragement, and bidding Miss Black \"Good day,\" departed,\nlooking behind her as long as possible. I followed my teacher. As she\nopened the door forty eyes were leveled at me; my hands were in my way\nsuddenly; my feet impeded my progress; how could I pass that wall of\neyes? A wisp of my dry, rough hair fell on my neck and tickled it; as\nI tried to poke it under my comb, I glanced at the faces before me.\nHow spirited and delicate they were! The creatures had their heads\ndressed as if they were at a party--in curls, or braids and ribbons.\nAn open, blank, _noli me tangere_ expression met my perturbed glance.\nI stood still, but my head went round. Miss Black mounted her desk,\nand surveyed the school-room. \"Miss Charlotte Alden, the desk next you\nis vacant; Miss C. Morgeson, the new pupil, may take it.\"\n\nMiss Charlotte answered, \"Yes mim,\" and ostentatiously swept away an\naccumulation of pencils, sponges, papers, and books, to make room for\nme. I took the seat, previously stumbling against her, whereat all\nthe girls, whose regards were fixed upon me, smiled. That was my\ninitiation.\n\nThe first day I was left to myself, to make studies. The school-room\nwas in the vestry of the church, a building near grand'ther's house.\nEach girl had a desk before her. Miss Black occupied a high stool in\na square box, where she heard single recitations, or lectured a pupil.\nThe vestry yard, where the girls romped, and exercised with skipping\nropes, a swing, and a set of tilting-boards, commanded a view of\ngrand'ther's premises; his street windows were exposed to the fire of\ntheir eyes and tongues.\n\nAfter I went home I examined myself in the glass, and drew an\nunfavorable conclusion from the inspection. My hair was parted zigzag;\none shoulder was higher than the other; my dress came up to my chin,\nand slipped down to my shoulder-blades. I was all waist; no hips were\ndeveloped my hands were red, and my nails chipped. I opened the trunk\nwhere my wardrobe was packed; what belonged to me was comfortable,\nin reference to weather and the wash, but not pretty. I found a\nmolasses-colored silk, called Turk satin--one of mother's old dresses,\nmade over for me, or an invidious selection of hers from the purchases\nof father, who sometimes made a mistake in taste, owing to the\nmisrepresentations of shopkeepers and milliners. While thus engaged\nAunt Mercy came for me, and began to scold when she saw that I had\ntumbled my clothes out of the trunk.\n\n\"Aunt Mercy, these things are horrid, all of them. Look at this\nshawl,\" and I unrolled a square silk fabric, the color of a sick\norange. \"Where did this come from?\"\n\n\"Saints upon earth!\" she exclaimed, \"your father bought it at the best\nstore in New York. It was costly.\"\n\n\"Now tell me, why do the pantalettes of those girls look so graceful?\nThey do not twirl round the ankle like a rope, as mine do.\"\n\n\"I can't say,\" she answered, with a sigh. \"But you ought to wear long\ndresses; now yours are tucked, and could be let down.\"\n\n\"And these red prunella boots--they look like boiled crabs.\" I put\nthem on, and walked round the room crab-fashion, till she laughed\nhysterically. \"Miss Charlotte Alden wears French kid slippers every\nday, and I must wear mine.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"you must only wear them to church.\"\n\n\"I shall talk to father about that, when he comes here next.\"\n\n\"Cassy, did Charlotte Alden speak to you to-day?\"\n\n\"No; but she made an acquaintance by stares.\"\n\n\"Well, never mind her if she says anything unpleasant to you; the\nAldens are a high set.\"\n\n\"Are they higher than we are in Surrey? Have they heard of my father,\nwho is equal to the President?\"\n\n\"We are all equal in the sight of God.\"\n\n\"You do not look as if you thought so, Aunt Mercy. Why do you say\nthings in Barmouth you never said in Surrey?\"\n\n\"Come downstairs, Cassandra, and help me finish the dishes.\"\n\nOur conversation was ended; but I still had my thoughts on the clothes\nquestion, and revolved my plans.\n\nAfter the morning exercises the next day, Miss Black called me in to\nher desk. \"I think,\" she said, \"you had better study Geology. It is\nimportant, for it will lead your mind up from nature to nature's\nGod. My young ladies have finished their studies in that direction;\ntherefore you will recite alone, once a day.\"\n\n\"Yes 'em,\" I replied; but it was the first time that I had heard of\nGeology. The compendium she gave me must have been dull and dry. I\ncould not get its lessons perfectly. It never inspired me with any\ninterest for land or sea. I could not associate any of its terms, or\ndescriptions, with the great rock under grand'ther's house. It was\nnot for Miss Black to open the nodules of my understanding, with her\nhammer of instruction. She proposed Botany also. The young ladies made\nbotanical excursions to the fields and woods outside Barmouth; I\nmight as well join the class at once. It was now in the family of the\nLegumes. I accompanied the class on one excursion. Not a soul appeared\nto know that I was present, and I declined going again. Composition\nI must write once a month. A few more details closed the interview. I\nmentioned in it that father desired me to study arithmetic. Miss Black\nplaced me in a class; but her interests were in the higher and more\nelegant branches of education. I made no more advance in the humble\nwalks of learning than in those adorned by the dissection of flowers,\nthe disruption of rocks, or the graces of composition. Though I\nentered upon my duties under protest, I soon became accustomed to\ntheir routine, and the rest of my life seemed more like a dream of the\nfuture than a realization of the present. I refused to go home at the\nend of the month. I preferred waiting, I said, to the end of the year.\nI was not urged to change my mind; neither was I applauded for my\nresolution. The day that I could have gone home, I asked father to\ndrive me to Milford, on the opposite side of the river which ran by\nBarmouth. I shut my eyes tight, when the horse struck the boards of\nthe long wooden bridge between the towns, and opened them when we\nstopped at an inn by the water side of Milford. Father took me into a\nparlor, where sat a handsome, fat woman, hemming towels.\n\n\"Is that you, Morgeson?\" she said. \"Is this your daughter?\"\n\n\"Yes; can I leave her with you, while I go to the bank? She has not\nbeen here before.\"\n\n\"Lord ha' mercy on us; you clip her wings, don't you? Come here,\nchild, and let me pull off your pelisse.\"\n\nI went to her with a haughty air; it did not please me to hear my\nfather called \"Morgeson,\" by a person unknown to me. She understood my\nexpression, and looked up at father; they both smiled, and I was vexed\nwith him for his unwarrantable familiarity. Pinching my cheek with her\nfat fingers, which were covered with red and green rings, she said,\n\"We shall do very well together. What a pretty silk pelisse, and\nsilver buckles, too.\"\n\nAfter father went out, and my bonnet was disposed of, Mrs. Tabor gave\nme a huge piece of delicious sponge-cake, which softened me somewhat.\n\n\"What is your name, dear?\"\n\n\"Morgeson.\"\n\n\"It is easy to see that.\"\n\n\"Well, Cassandra.\"\n\n\"Oh, what a lovely name,\" and she drew from her workbasket a\npaper-covered book; \"there is no name in this novel half so pretty; I\nwish the heroine's name had been Cassandra instead of Aldebrante.\"\n\n\"Let me see it,\" I begged.\n\n\"There is a horrid monk in it\"; but she gave it to me, and was\npresently called out. I devoured its pages, and for the only time in\nthat year of Barmouth life, I forgot my own wants and woes. She saw\nmy interest in the book when she came back, and coaxed it from me,\noffering me more cake, which I accepted. She told me that she had\nknown father for years, and that he kept his horse at the inn stables,\nand dined with her. \"But I never knew that he had a daughter,\" she\ncontinued. \"Are you the only child?\"\n\n\"I have a sister,\" and after a moment remembered that I had a brother,\ntoo; but did not think it a fact necessary to mention.\n\n\"I have no children.\"\n\n\"But you have novels to read.\"\n\nShe laughed, and by the time father returned we were quite chatty.\nAfter dinner I asked him to go to some shops with me. He took me to a\njeweler's, and without consulting me bought an immense mosaic brooch,\nwith a ruined castle on it, and a pretty ring with a gold stone.\n\n\"Is there anything more?\" he asked, \"you would like?\"\n\n\"Yes, I want a pink calico dress.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because the girls at Miss Black's wear pink calico.\"\n\n\"Why not get a pink silk?\"\n\n\"I must have a pink French calico, with a three-cornered white cloud\non it; it is the fashion.\"\n\n\"The fashion!\" he echoed with contempt. But the dress was bought, and\nwe went back to Barmouth.\n\nWhen I appeared in school with my new brooch and ring the girls\ncrowded round me.\n\n\"What does that pin represent, whose estate?\" inquired one, with envy\nin her voice.\n\n\"Don't the ring make the blood rush into your hand?\" asked another;\n\"it looks so.\"\n\n\"Does it?\" I answered; \"I'll hold up my hand in the air, as you do, to\nmake it white.\"\n\n\"What is your father's business?\" asked Elmira Sawyer, \"is he a\ntailor?\"\n\nHer insolence made my head swim; but I did not reply. When recess was\nover a few minutes afterward, I cried under the lid of my desk. These\ngirls overpowered me, for I could not conciliate them, and had no idea\nof revenge, believing that their ridicule was deserved. But I thought\nI should like to prove myself respectable. How could I? Grand'ther\n_was_ a tailor, and I could not demean myself by assuring them that my\nfather was a gentleman.\n\nIn the course of a month Aunt Mercy had my pink calico made up by\nthe best dressmaker in Barmouth. When I put it on I thought I looked\nbetter than I ever had before, and went into school triumphantly\nwith it. The girls surveyed me in silence; but criticised me. At last\nCharlotte Alden asked me in a whisper if old Mr. Warren made my dress.\nShe wrote on a piece of paper, in large letters--\"Girls, don't let's\nwear our pink calicoes again,\" and pushing it over to Elmira Sawyer,\nmade signs that the paper should be passed to all the girls. They read\nit, and turning to Charlotte Alden nodded. I watched the paper as\nit made its round, and saw Mary Bennett drop it on the floor with a\ngiggle.\n\nIt was a rainy day, and we passed the recess indoors. I remained\nquiet, looking over my lesson. \"The first period ends with the\ncarboniferous system; the second includes the saliferous and magnesian\nsystems; the third comprises the oolitic and chalk systems; the\nfourth--\" \"How attentive some people are to their lessons,\" I heard\nCharlotte Alden say. Looking up, I saw her near me with Elmira Sawyer.\n\n\"What is that you say?\" I asked sharply.\n\n\"I am not speaking to you.\"\n\n\"I am angry,\" I said in a low tone, and rising, \"and have borne\nenough.\"\n\n\"Who are _you_ that you should be angry? We have heard about your\nmother, when she was in love, poor thing.\"\n\nI struck her so violent a blow in the face that she staggered\nbackward. \"You are a liar,\" I said, \"and you must let me alone.\"\nElmira Sawyer turned white, and moved away. I threw my book at her; it\nhit her head, and her comb was broken by my geological systems. There\nwas a stir; Miss Black hurried from her desk, saying, \"Young ladies,\nwhat does this mean? Miss C. Morgeson, your temper equals your\nvulgarity, I find. Take your seat in my desk.\"\n\nI obeyed her, and as we passed Mary Bennett's desk, where I saw the\npaper fall, I picked it up. \"See the good manners of your favorite,\nMiss Black; read it.\" She bit her lips as she glanced over it, turned\nback as if to speak to Charlotte Alden, looked at me again, and went\non: \"Sit down, Miss C. Morgeson, and reflect on the blow you have\ngiven. Will you ask pardon?\"\n\n\"I will not; you know that.\"\n\n\"I have never resorted to severe punishment yet; but I fear I shall be\nobliged to in your case.\"\n\n\"Let me go from here.\" I clenched my hands, and tried to get up. She\nheld me down on the seat, and we looked close in each other's eyes.\n\"You are a bad girl.\" \"And you are a bad woman,\" I replied; \"mean and\ncruel.\" She made a motion to strike me, but her hand dropped; I felt\nmy nostrils quiver strangely. \"For shame,\" she said, in a tremulous\nvoice, and turned away. I sat on the bench at the back of the desk,\nheartily tired, till school was dismissed; as Charlotte Alden passed\nout, courtesying, Miss Black said she hoped she would extend a\nChristian forgiveness to Miss C. Morgeson, for her unladylike\nbehavior. \"Miss C. Morgeson is a peculiar case.\"\n\nShe gave her a meaning look, which was not lost upon me. Charlotte\nanswered, \"Certainly,\" and bowed to me gracefully, whereat I felt a\nfresh sense of my demerits, and concluded that I was worsted in the\nfray.\n\nMiss Black asked no explanation of the affair; it was dropped, and\nnone of the girls alluded to it by hint or look afterward. When I told\nAunt Mercy of it, she turned pale, and said she knew what Charlotte\nAlden meant, and that perhaps mother would tell me in good time.\n\n\"We had a good many troubles in our young days, Cassy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nThe atmosphere of my two lives was so different, that when I passed\ninto one, the other ceased to affect me. I forgot all that I suffered\nand hated at Miss Black's, as soon as I crossed the threshold, and\nentered grand'ther's house. The difference kept up a healthy mean;\neither alone would perhaps have been more than I could then have\nsustained. All that year my life was narrowed to that house, my\nschool, and the church. Father offered to take me to ride, when\nhe came to Barmouth, or carry me to Milford; but the motion of the\ncarriage, and the conveying power of the horse, created such a fearful\nand realizing sense of escape, that I gave up riding with him. Aunt\nMercy seldom left home; my schoolmates did not invite me to visit\nthem; the seashore was too distant for me to ramble there; the\nstorehouses and wharves by the river-side offered no agreeable\nsaunterings; and the street, in Aunt Mercy's estimation, was not the\nplace for an idle promenade. My exercise, therefore, was confined\nto the garden--a pleasant spot, now that midsummer had come, and\ninhabited with winged and crawling creatures, with whom I claimed\ncompanionship, especially with the red, furry caterpillars, that have,\nalas, nearly passed away, and given place to a variegated, fantastic\ntribe, which gentleman farmers are fond of writing about.\n\nMother rode over to Barmouth occasionally, but seemed more glad when\nshe went away than when she came. Veronica came with her once, but\nsaid she would come no more while I was there. She too would wait till\nthe end of the year, for I spoiled the place. She said this so calmly\nthat I never thought of being offended by it. I told her the episode\nof the pink calico. \"It is a lovely color,\" she said, when I showed it\nto her. \"If you like, I will take it home and burn it.\"\n\nAs I developed the dramatic part of my story--the blow given Charlotte\nAlden, Verry rubbed her face shrinkingly, as if she had felt the blow.\n\"Let me see your hand,\" she asked; \"did I ever strike anybody?\"\n\n\"You threw a pail of salt downstairs, once, upon my head, and put out\nmy sight.\"\n\n\"I wish, when you are home, you would pound Mr. Park; he talks too\nmuch about the Resurrection. And,\" she added mysteriously, \"he likes\nmother.\"\n\n\"Likes mother!\" I said aghast.\n\n\"He watches her so when she holds Arthur! Why do you stare at me? Why\ndo I talk to you? I am going. Now mind, I shall never leave home to go\nto any school; I shall know enough without.\"\n\nWhile Veronica was holding this placable talk with me, I discovered in\nher the high-bred air, the absence of which I deplored in myself.\n\nHow cool and unimpressionable she looked! She did not attract me then.\nMy mind wandered to what I had heard Mary Bennett say, in recess one\nday, that her brother had seen me in church, and came home with the\nopinion that I was the handsomest girl in Miss Black's school.\n\n\"Is it possible!\" replied the girl to whom she had made the remark. \"I\nnever should think of calling her pretty.\"\n\n\"Stop, Veronica,\" I called; \"am I pretty?\" She turned back. \"Everybody\nin Surrey says so; and everybody says I am not.\" And she banged the\ndoor against me.\n\nShe did not come to Barmouth again. She was ill in the winter, and,\nfather told me, queerer than ever, and more trouble. The summer\npassed, and I had no particular torment, except Miss Black's reference\nto composition. I could not do justice to the themes she gave us, not\nhaving the books from which she took them at command, and betrayed\nan ignorance which excited her utmost contempt, on \"The Scenery of\nSingapore,\" \"The Habits of the Hottentots,\" and \"The Relative Merits\nof Homer and Virgil.\"\n\nIn October Sally and Ruth Aiken came for the fall sewing. They had\nfarmed it all summer, they said, and were tanned so deep a hue that\ntheir faces bore no small resemblance to ham. Ruth brought me some\napples in an ochre-colored bag, and Sally eyed me with her old\nseverity. As they took their accustomed seats at the table, I thought\nthey had swallowed the interval of time which had gone by since they\nleft, so precisely the same was the moment of their leaving and that\nof their coming back. I knew grand'ther no better than when I saw him\nfirst. He was sociable to those who visited the house, but never with\nthose abiding in his family. Me he never noticed, except when I ate\nless than usual; then he peered into my face, and said, \"What ails\nyou?\" We had the benefit of his taciturn presence continually, for he\nrarely went out; and although he did not interfere with Aunt Mercy's\nwork, he supervised it, weighed and measured every article that was\nused, and kept the cellar and garden in perfect order.\n\nIt was approaching the season of killing the pig, and he conferred\noften with Aunt Mercy on the subject. The weather was watched, and the\npig poked daily, in the hope that the fat was thickening on his ribs.\nWhen the day of his destiny arrived, there was almost confusion in the\nhouse, and for a week after, of evenings, grand'ther went about with a\nlantern, and was not himself till a new occupant was obtained for the\nvacant pen, and all his idiosyncracies revealed and understood.\n\n\"Grand'ther,\" I asked, \"will the beautiful pigeons that live in the\npig's roof like the horrid new pig?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered, briskly rubbing his hands, \"but they eat the pig's\ncorn; and I can't afford that; I shall have to shoot them, I guess.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't, grand'ther.\"\n\n\"I will this very day. Where's the gun, Mercy?\"\n\nIn an hour the pigeons were shot, except two which had flown away.\n\n\"Why did you ask him not to shoot the pigeons?\" said Aunt Mercy. \"If\nyou had said nothing, he would not have done, it.\"\n\n\"He is a disagreeable relation,\" I answered, \"and I am glad he is a\ntailor.\"\n\nAunt Mercy reproved me; but the loss of the pigeons vexed her. Perhaps\ngrand'ther thought so, for that night he asked after her geraniums,\nand told her that a gardener had promised him some fine slips for\nher. She looked pleased, but did not thank him. There was already a\nbeautiful stand of flowers in the middle room, which was odorous the\nyear round with their perfume.\n\nThe weather was now cold, and we congregated about the fire; for there\nwas no other comfortable room in the house. One afternoon, when I\nwas digging in Aunt Mercy's geranium pots, and picking off the dead\nleaves, two deacons came to visit grand'ther, and, hovering over the\nfire with him, complained of the lukewarmness of the church brethren\nin regard to the spiritual condition of the Society. A shower of grace\nwas needed; there were reviving symptoms in some of the neighboring\nchurches, but none in Barmouth. Something must be done--a fast day\nappointed, or especial prayer-meetings held. This was on Saturday;\nthe next day the ceremony of the Lord's Supper would take place, and\ngrand'ther recommended that the minister should be asked to suggest\nsomething to the church which might remove it from its hardness.\n\n\"Are the vessels scoured, Mercy?\" he asked, after the deacons had\ngone.\n\n\"I have no sand.\"\n\nHe presently brought her a biggin of fine white sand, which brought\nthe shore of Surrey to my mind's eye. I followed her as she carried\nit to the well-room, where I saw, on the meal-chest, two large pewter\nplates, two flagons of the same metal, and a dozen or more cups, some\nof silver, and marked with the owner's name. They were soon cleaned.\nThen she made a fire in the oven, and mixed loaves in a peculiar\nshape, and launched them into the oven. She watched the bread\ncarefully, and took it out before it had time to brown.\n\n\"This work belongs to the deacons' wives,\" she said; \"but it has\nbeen done in this house for years. The bread is not like ours--it is\nunleavened.\"\n\nGrand'ther carried it into the church after she had cut it with a\nsharp knife so that at the touch it would fall apart into square bits.\nWhen the remains were brought back, I went to the closet, where they\nwere deposited, and took a piece of the bread, eating it reflectively,\nto test its solemnizing powers. I felt none, and when Aunt Mercy\nboiled the remnants with milk for a pudding, the sacred ideality of\nthe ceremony I had seen at church was destroyed for me.\n\nWas it a pity that my life was not conducted on Nature's plan, who\nshows us the beautiful, while she conceals the interior? We do not see\nthe roots of her roses, and she hides from us her skeletons.\n\nNovember passed, with its Thanksgiving--the sole day of all the year\nwhich grand'ther celebrated, by buying a goose for dinner, which goose\nwas stewed with rye dumplings, that slid over my plate like glass\nballs. Sally and Ruth betook themselves to their farm, and hybernated.\nDecember came, and with it a young woman named Caroline, to learn the\ntailor's trade. Lively and pretty, she changed our atmosphere.\nShe broke the silence of the morning by singing the \"Star-spangled\nBanner,\" or the \"Braes of Balquhither,\" and disturbed the monotony of\nthe evenings by making molasses candy, which grand'ther ate, and which\nseemed to have a mollifying influence. Grand'ther kept his eye on\nCaroline; but his eye had no disturbing effect. She had no perception\nof his character; was fearless with him, and went contrary to all his\nideas, and he liked her for it. She even reproved him for keeping such\na long face. Her sewing, which was very bad, tried his patience so,\nthat if it had not been for her mother, who was a poor widow, he would\nhave given up the task of teaching her the trade. She said she knew\nshe couldn't learn it; what was the use of trying? She meant to go\nWest, and thought she might make a good home-missionary, as she did,\nfor she married a poor young man, who had forsaken the trade of a\ncooper, to study for the ministry, and was helped off to Ohio by\nthe Society of Home Missions. She came to see me in Surrey ten years\nafterward, a gaunt, hollow-eyed woman, of forbidding manners, and an\nimplacable faith in no rewards or punishments this side of the grave.\n\nI suffered so from the cold that December that I informed mother of\nthe fact by letter. She wrote back:\n\n\"My child, have courage. One of these days you will feel a tender\npity, when you think of your mother's girlhood. You are learning how\nshe lived at your age. I trembled at the prosperity of your opening\nlife, and believed it best for you to have a period of contrast. I\nthought you would, by and by, understand me better than I do myself;\nfor you are not like me, Cassy, you are like your father. You shall\nnever go back to Barmouth, unless you wish it. Dear Cassy, do you pray\nany? I send you some new petticoats, and a shawl. Does Mercy warm the\nbed for you? Your affectionate Mother.\"\n\nI dressed and undressed in Aunt Mercy's room, which was under the\nroof, with benumbed fingers. My hair was like the coat of a cow in\nfrosty weather; it was so frowzy, and so divided against itself, that\nwhen I tried to comb it, it streamed out like the tail of a comet.\nAunt Mercy discovered that I was afflicted with chilblains, and had\na good cry over them, telling me, at the same moment, that my French\nslippers were the cause. We had but one fire in the house, except the\nfire in the shop, which was allowed to go down at sunset. Sometimes\nI found a remaining warmth in the goose, which had been left in\nthe ashes, and borrowed it for my stiffened fingers. I did not get\nthoroughly warm all day, for the fire in the middle room, made of\ngreen wood, was continually in the process of being stifled with a\ngreener stick, as the others kindled. The school-room was warm; but I\nhad a back seat by a window, where my feet were iced by a current, and\nmy head exposed to a draught. In January I had so bad an ague that\nI was confined at home a week. But I grew fast in spite of all my\ndiscomforts. Aunt Mercy took the tucks out of my skirts, and I burst\nout where there were no tucks. I assumed a womanly shape. Stiff as\nmy hands were, and purple as were my arms, I could see that they were\nplump and well shaped. I had lost the meagerness of childhood and\nbegan to feel a new and delightful affluence. What an appetite I had,\ntoo!\n\n\"The creature will eat us out of house and home,\" said grand'ther one\nday, looking at me, for him good-humoredly.\n\n\"Well, don't shoot me, as you shot the pigeons.\"\n\n\"Pah, have pigeons a soul?\"\n\nIn February the weather softened, and a great revival broke out. It\nwas the dullest time of the year in Barmouth. The ships were at\nsea still, and the farmers had only to fodder their cattle, so that\neverybody could attend the protracted meeting. It was the same as\nSunday at our house for nine days. Miss Black, in consequence of the\nawakening, dismissed the school for two weeks, that the pupils might\nprofit in what she told us was The Scheme of Salvation.\n\nCaroline was among the first converts. I observed her from the moment\nI was told she was under Conviction, till she experienced Religion.\nShe sang no more of mornings, and the making of molasses candy was\nsuspended in the evenings. I thought her less pleasing, and felt shy\nof holding ordinary conversations with her, for had she not been set\napart for a mysterious work? I perceived that when she sewed between\nmeetings her work was worse done than ever; but grand'ther made no\nmention of it. I went with Aunt Mercy to meetings three times a day,\nand employed myself in scanning the countenances around me, curious to\ndiscover the first symptoms of Conviction.\n\nOne night when grand'ther came in to prayers, he told Aunt Mercy that\nPardon Hitch was awfully distressed in mind, in view of his sins. She\nreplied that he was always a good man.\n\n\"As good as any unregenerate man can be.\"\n\n\"I might as well be a thorough reprobate then,\" I thought, \"like Sal\nThompson, who seems remarkably happy, as to try to behave as well as\nPardon Hitch, who is a model in Barmouth.\"\n\nWhen we went to church the next morning, I saw him in one of the back\npews, leaning against the rail, as if he had no strength. His face was\nfull of anguish. He sat there motionless all day. He was prayed for,\nbut did not seem to hear the prayers. At night his wife led him home.\nBy the end of the third day, he interrupted an exhorting brother by\nrising, and uttering an inarticulate cry. We all looked. The tears\nwere streaming down his pale face, which was lighted up by a smile\nof joy. He seemed like a man escaped from some great danger, torn,\nbruised, breathless, but alive. The minister left the pulpit to shake\nhands with him; the brethren crowded round to congratulate him, and\nthe meeting broke up at once.\n\nNeither grand'ther nor Aunt Mercy had spoken to me concerning\nmy interest in Religion; but on that very evening Mr. Boold, the\nminister, came in to tea and asked me, while he was taking off his\novercoat, if I knew that Christ had died for me? I answered that I was\nnot sure of it.\n\n\"Do you read your Bible, child?\"\n\n\"Every day.\"\n\n\"And what does it teach you?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"Miss Mercy, I will thank you for another cup. 'Now is the day, and\nnow is the hour; come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, I\nwill give you rest.'\"\n\n\"But I do not want rest; I have no burden,\" I said.\n\n\"Cassandra,\" thundered grand'ther, \"have you no respect for God nor\nman?\"\n\n\"Have you read,\" went on the minister, \"the memoir of Nathan\nDickerman? A mere child, he realized his burden of sin in time, and\ndied sanctified.\"\n\nI thought it best to say no more. Aunt Mercy looked disturbed, and\nleft the table as soon as she could with decency.\n\n\"Cassandra,\" she said, when we were alone, \"what will become of you?\"\n\n\"What will, indeed? You have always said that I was possessed. Why did\nyou not explain this fact to Mr. Boold?\"\n\nShe kissed me,--her usual treatment when she was perplexed.\n\nThe revival culminated and declined. Sixty new members were admitted\ninto the church, and things settled into the old state. School was\nresumed; I found that not one of my schoolmates had met with a change,\nbut Miss Black did not touch on the topic. My year was nearly out;\nMarch had come and gone, and it was now April. One mild day, in\nthe latter part of the month, the girls went to the yard at recess.\nCharlotte Alden said pleasantly that the weather was fair enough for\nout-of-doors play, and asked if I would try the tilt. I gave a cordial\nassent. We balanced the board so that each could seat herself, and\nbegan to tilt slowly. As she was heavy, I was obliged to exert my\nstrength to keep my place, and move her. She asked if I dared to go\nhigher. \"Oh yes, if you wish it.\" Happening to look round, I caught\nher winking at the girls near us, and felt that she was brewing\nmischief, but I had no time to dwell on it. She bore the end she was\non to the ground with a sudden jerk, and I fell from the other, some\neight feet, struck a stone, and fainted.\n\nThe next thing that I recollect was Aunt Mercy's carrying me across\nthe street in her arms. She had seen my fall from the window. Reaching\nthe house, she let me slide on the floor in a heap, and began to wring\nher hands and stamp her feet.\n\n\"I am not hurt, Aunt Mercy.\"\n\n\"You are nearly killed, you know you are. This is your last day at\nthat miserable school. I am going for the doctor, as soon as you say\nyou wont faint again.\"\n\nThus my education at Miss Black's was finished with a blow.\n\nWhen Aunt Mercy represented to Miss Black that I was not to return to\nschool, and that she feared I had not made the improvement that was\nexpected, Miss Black asked, with hauteur, what had been expected--what\nmy friends _could_ expect. Aunt Mercy was intimidated, and retired as\nsoon as she had paid her the last quarter's bills.\n\nA week after my tournament with Charlotte Alden I went back to Surrey.\nThere was little preparation to make--few friends to bid farewell.\nRuth and Sally had emerged from their farm, and were sewing again at\ngrand'ther's. Sally bade me remember that riches took to themselves\nwings and flew away; she _hoped_ they had not been a snare to my\nmother; but she wasn't what she was, it was a fact.\n\n\"No, she isn't,\" Ruth affirmed. \"Do you remember, Sally, when she came\nout to the farm once, and rode the white colt bare-back round the big\nmeadow, with her hair flying?\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, Ruth.\"\n\nRuth looked penitent as she gave me a paper of hollyhock seeds, and\nsaid the flowers were a beautiful blood-red, and that I must plant\nthem near the sink drain. Caroline had already gone home, so Aunt\nMercy had nothing cheery but her plants and her snuff; for she had\nlately contracted the habit of snuff-taking but very privately.\n\n\"Train her well, Locke; she is skittish,\" said grand'ther as we got\ninto the chaise to go home.\n\n\"Grand'ther, if I am ever rich enough to own a peaked-roof pig-sty,\nwill you come and see me?\"\n\n\"Away with you.\" And he went nimbly back to the house, chafing his\nlittle hands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\nI was going home! When we rode over the brow of the hill within a\nmile of Surrey, and I saw the crescent-shaped village, and the tall\nchimneys of our house on its outer edge, instead of my heart leaping\nfor joy, as I had expected, a sudden indifference filled it. I felt\naverse to the change from the narrow ways of Barmouth, which, for the\nmoment, I regretted. When I entered the house, and saw mother in her\nold place, her surroundings unaltered, I suffered a disappointment.\nI had not had the power of transferring the atmosphere of my year's\nmisery to Surrey.\n\nThe family gathered round me. I heard the wonted sound of the banging\nof doors. \"The doors at grand'ther's,\" I mused, \"had list nailed\nround their edges; but then he _had_ the list, being a tailor.\"\n\n\"I vum,\" said Temperance, with her hand on her hip, and not offering to\napproach me, \"your hair is as thick as a mop.\"\n\nHepsey, rubbing her fingers against her thumb, remarked that she\nhoped learning had not taken away my appetite. \"I have made an Indian\nbannock for you, and we are going to have broiled sword-fish, besides,\nfor supper. Is it best to cook more, Mrs. Morgeson, now that Cassandra\nhas come?\"\n\nThe boy, by name Charles, came to see the new arrival, but smitten\nwith diffidence crept under the table, and examined me from his\nretreat.\n\n\"Don't you wish to see Arthur?\" inquired mother; \"he is getting his\ndouble teeth.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, and where's Veronica?\"\n\n\"She's up garret writing geography, and told me nothing in the world\nmust disturb her, till she had finished an account of the city of\nPalmiry,\" said Temperance.\n\n\"Call her when supper is ready,\" replied mother, who asked me to come\ninto the bedroom where Arthur was sleeping. He was a handsome child,\nlarge and fair, and as I lifted his white, lax fingers, a torrent of\nlove swept through me, and I kissed him.\n\n\"I am afraid I make an idol of him, Cassy.\"\n\n\"Are you unhappy because you love him so well, mother, and feel that\nyou must make expiation?\"\n\n\"Cassandra,\" she spoke with haste, \"did you experience any shadow of a\nchange during the revival at Barmouth?\"\n\n\"No more than the baby here did.\"\n\n\"I shall have faith, though, that it will be well with you, because\nyou have had the blessing of so good a man as your grand'ther.\"\n\n\"But I never heard a word of grand'ther's prayers. Do you remember his\nvoice?\"\n\nA smile crept into her blue eye, as she said: \"My hearing him, or not,\nwould make no difference, since God could hear and answer.\"\n\n\"Grand'ther does not like me; I never pleased him.\"\n\nShe looked astonished, then reflective. It occurred to her that she,\nalso, had been no favorite of his. She changed the subject. We talked\non what had happened in Surrey, and commenced a discussion on my\nwardrobe, when we were summoned to tea. Temperance brought Arthur to\nthe table half asleep, but he roused when she drummed on his plate\nwith a spoon. Hepsey was stationed by the bannock, knife in hand, to\nserve it. As we began our meal, Veronica came in from the kitchen,\nwith a plate of toasted crackers. She set the plate down, and gravely\nshook hands with me, saying she had concluded to live entirely on\ntoast, but supposed I would eat all sorts of food, as usual. She had\ngrown tall; her face was still long and narrow, but prettier, and\nher large, dark eyes had a slight cast, which gave her face an\nindescribable expression. Distant, indifferent, and speculative as the\neyes were, a ray of fire shot into them occasionally, which made her\ngaze powerful and concentrated. I was within a month of sixteen, and\nVeronica was in her thirteenth year; but she looked as old as I did.\nShe carefully prepared her toast with milk and butter, and ate it in\nsilence. The plenty around me, the ease and independence, gave me a\ndelightful sense of comfort. The dishes were odd, some of china, some\nof delf, and were continually moved out of their places, for we helped\nourselves, although Temperance stayed in the room, ostensibly as a\nwaiter. She was too much engaged in conversation to fulfill her duties\nthat way. I looked round the room; nothing had been added to it,\nexcept red damask curtains, which were out of keeping with the\nold chintz covers. It was a delightful room, however; the blue sea\nglimmered between the curtains, and, turning my eyes toward it, my\nheart gave the leap which I had looked for. I grew blithe as I saw it\nwinking under the rays of the afternoon sun, and, clapping my hands,\nsaid I was glad to get home. We left Veronica at the table, and mother\nresumed her conversation with me in a corner of the room. Presently\nTemperance came in with Charles, bringing fresh plates. As soon\nas they began their supper, Veronica asked Temperance how the fish\ntasted.\n\n\"Is it salt?\"\n\n\"Middling.\"\n\n\"How is the bannock?\"\n\n\"Excellent. I will say it for Hepsey that she hasn't her beat as a\ncook; been at it long enough,\" she added, in expiation of her praise.\n\n\"Temperance, is that pound cake, or sponge?\"\n\n\"Pound.\"\n\n\"Charles can eat it,\" Verry said with a sigh.\n\n\"A mighty small piece he'll have--the glutton. But he has not been\nhere long; they are all so when they first come.\"\n\nShe then gave him a large slice of the cake.\n\nVeronica, contrary to her wont, huddled herself on the sofa. Arthur\nplayed round the chair of mother, who looked happy and forgetful.\nAfter Temperance had rearranged the table for father's supper we were\nquiet. I meditated how I could best amuse myself, where I should go,\nand what I should do, when Veronica, whom I had forgotten, interrupted\nmy thoughts.\n\n\"Mother,\" she said, \"eating toast does not make me better-tempered;\nI feel evil still. You know,\" turning to me, \"that my temper is worse\nthan ever; it is like a tiger's.\"\n\n\"Oh, Verry,\" said mother, \"not quite so bad; you are too hard upon\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Mother, you said so to Hepsey, when I tore her turban from her head,\nit was _so_ ugly. Can you forget you said such a thing?\"\n\n\"Verry, you drive me wild. Must I say that I was wrong? Say so to my\nown child?\"\n\nVerry turned her face to the wall and said no more; but she had\nstarted a less pleasant train of thought. It was changed again by\nTemperance coming with lights. Though the tall brass lamps glittered\nlike gold, their circle of light was small; the corners of the room\nwere obscure. Mr. Park, entering, retreated into one, and mother was\nobliged to forego the pleasure of undressing Arthur; so she sent him\noff with Temperance and Charles, whose duty it was to rock the cradle\nas long as his babyship required.\n\nSoon after father came, and Hepsey brought in his hot supper; while he\nwas eating it, Grandfather John Morgeson bustled in. As he shook hands\nwith me, I saw that his hair had whitened; he held a tasseled cane\nbetween his knees, and thumped the floor whenever he asked a question.\nMr. Park buzzed about the last Sunday's discourse, and mother listened\nwith a vague, respectful attention. Her hand was pressed against her\nbreast, as if she were repressing an inward voice which claimed her\nattention. Leaning her head against her chair, she had quite pushed\nout her comb, her hair dropped on her shoulder, and looked like a\nbrown, coiled serpent. Veronica, who had been silently observing her,\nrose from the sofa, picked up the comb, and fastened her hair, without\nspeaking. As she passed she gave me a dark look.\n\n\"Eh, Verry,\" said father, \"are you there? Were you glad to see Cassy\nhome again?\"\n\n\"Should I be glad? What can _she_ do?\"\n\nGrandfather pursed up his mouth, and turned toward mother, as if he\nwould like to say: \"You understand bringing up children, don't you?\"\n\nShe comprehended him, and, giving her head a slight toss, told Verry\nto go and play on the piano.\n\n\"I was going,\" she answered pettishly, and darting out a moment after\nwe heard her.\n\nGrandfather went, and presently Mr. Park got up in a lingering way,\nsaid that Verry must learn to play for the Lord, and bade us \"Good\nnight.\" But he came back again, to ask me if I would join Dr. Snell's\nBible Class. It would meet the next evening; the boys and girls of my\nown age went. I promised him to go, wondering whether I should meet an\nancient beau, Joe Bacon. Mother retired; Verry still played.\n\n\"Her talent is wonderful,\" said father, taking the cigar from his\nmouth. \"By the way, you must take lessons in Milford; I wish you would\nlearn to sing.\" I acquiesced, but I had no wish to learn to play. I\ncould never perform mechanically what I heard now from Verry. When she\nceased, I woke from a dream, chaotic, but not tumultuous, beautiful,\nbut inharmonious. Though the fire had gone out, the lamps winked\nbrightly, and father, moving his cigar to the other side of his mouth,\nchanged his regards from one lamp to the other, and said he thought\nI was growing to be an attractive girl. He asked me if I would take\npains to make myself an accomplished one also? I must, of course, be\nleft to myself in many things; but he hoped that I would confide in\nhim, if I did not ask his advice. A very strong relation of reserve\ngenerally existed between parent and child, instead of a confidential\none, and the child was apt to discover that reserve on the part of the\nparent was not superiority, but cowardice, or indifference. \"Let it\nnot be so with us,\" was his conclusion. He threw away the stump of\nhis cigar, and went to fasten the hall-door. I took one of the brass\nlamps, proposing to go to bed. As I passed through the upper entry,\nVeronica opened her door. She was undressed, and had a little book\nin her hand, which she shook at me, saying, \"There is the day of the\nmonth put down on which you came home; and now mind,\" then shut the\ndoor. I pondered over what father had said; he had perceived something\nin me which I was not aware of. I resolved to think seriously over it;\nin the morning I found I had not thought of it at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\nThe next evening I dressed my hair after the fashion of the Barmouth\ngirls, with the small pride of wishing to make myself look different\nfrom the Surrey girls. I expected they would stare at me in the Bible\nClass. It would be my debut as a grown girl, and I must offer myself\nto their criticism. I went late, so that I might be observed by the\nassembled class. It met in the upper story of Temperance Hall--a new\nedifice. As I climbed the steep stairs, Joe Bacon's head came in view;\nhe had stationed himself on a bench at the landing to watch for my\narrival, of which he had been apprized by our satellite, Charles. Joe\nwas the first boy who had ever offered his arm as my escort home from\na party. After that event I had felt that there was something between\nus which the world did not understand. I was flattered, therefore,\nat the first glimpse of him on this occasion. When Dr. Snell made his\nopening prayer, Joe thrust a Bible before me, open at the lesson of\nthe evening, and then, rubbing his nose with embarrassment, fixed his\neyes with timid assurance on the opposite wall. Several of my Morgeson\ncousins were present, greeting me with sniffs. But I was disappointed\nin Joe Bacon; how young and shabby he looked! He wore a monkey jacket,\nprobably a remnant of his sea-going father's wardrobe. He had done\nhis best, however, for his hair was greased, and combed to a marble\nsmoothness; its sleekness vexed me, not remembering at that moment the\npains I had taken to dress my own hair, for a more ignoble end.\n\nThe girls gathered round me, after the class was dismissed; and when\nDr. Snell came down from his desk, he said he was glad to see me,\nand that I must come to his rooms to look over the new books he had\nreceived. Dr. Snell was no exception to the rule that a minister must\nnot be a native among his own people. His long residence in Surrey had\nfailed to make him appear like one. A bachelor, with a small\nprivate fortune, his style of living differed from the average\nof Congregational parsons. His library was the only lion in our\nneighborhood. His taste as a collector made him known abroad, and he\nhad a reputation which was not dreamed of by his parishioners,\nwho thought him queer and simple. He loved old fashions; wore\nknee-breeches, and silver buckles in his shoes; brewed metheglin in\nhis closet, and drank it from silver-pegged flagons; and kept diet\nbread on a salver to offer his visitors. He lived near us on the north\nroad, and was very much afraid of his landlady, Mrs. Grossman, who\nsat in terrible state in her parlor, the year through, wearing a black\nsatin cloak and an awful structure of a cap, which had a potent nod.\n\nI was pleased with Dr. Snell's notice; his smile was courtly and his\nbow Grandisonian.\n\nJoe Bacon was waiting at the foot of the stairs. He obtruded his arm,\nand hoarsely muttered, \"See you home.\" I took it, and we marched along\nsilently, till we were beyond the sound of voices. He began, rather\ninarticulately, to say how glad he was to see me, and that he hoped\nhe was going to have better times now; but I could make no response\nto his wishes; the suspicion that he had a serious liking for me was\ndisgusting. As he talked on I grew irritable, and replied shortly.\nWhen we reached our house, I slipped my hand from his arm, and ran\nup the steps, turning back with my hand on the door-knob to say,\n\"Good-night.\" The lamp in the hall shone through the fanlight upon\nhis face; it looked intelligent with pain. I skipped down the steps.\n\"Please open the door, Joe.\" He brightened, but before he could comply\nwith my request Temperance flung it wide, for the purpose of making a\nsurvey of the clouds and guessing at to-morrow's weather. His retreat\nwas precipitate.\n\n\"Oh ho,\" said Temperance, \"a feller came home with you. We shall have\nsomebody sitting up a-Thursday nights, I reckon, before long.\"\n\n\"Nonsense with your Thursday nights.\"\n\n\"Everybody is just alike. We shall have rain, see if we don't; rain or\nno rain, I'll whitewash to-morrow.\"\n\nPoor Joe! That night ended my first sentiment. He died with the\nmeasles in less than a month.\n\n\"I wish,\" said Temperance, who was spelling over a newspaper, \"that\nDr. Snell would come in before the plum-cake is gone, that Hepsey made\nlast. The old dear loves it; he is always hungry. I candidly believe\nMis Grossman keeps him short.\"\n\nI expected that Temperance would break out then about Joe; but she\nnever mentioned him, except to tell me that she had heard of his\ndeath. She did not whitewash the next day, for Charles came down with\nthe measles, and was tended by her with a fretful tenderness. Veronica\nwas seized soon after, and then Arthur, and then I had them. Veronica\nwas the worst patient. When her room was darkened she got out of bed,\ntore down the quilt that was fastened to the window, and broke three\npanes of glass before she could be captured and taken back. The quilt\nwas not put up again, however. She cried with anger, unless her hands\nwere continually washed with lavender water, and made little pellets\nof cotton which she stuffed in her ears and nose, so that she might\nnot hear or smell.\n\nI went to Dr. Snell's as soon as I was able. He was in his bedchamber,\nwriting a sermon on fine note-paper, and had disarranged the wide\nruffles of his shirt so that he looked like a mildly angry turkey.\nThrusting his spectacles up into the roots of his hair, he rose,\nand led me into a large room adjoining his bedroom, which contained\nnothing but tall bookcases, threw open the doors of one, pushed up a\nlittle ladder before it, for me to mount to a row of volumes bound in\ncalf, whose backs were labeled \"British Classics.\" \"There,\" he said,\n\"you will find 'The Spectator,'\" and trotted back to his sermon, with\nhis pen in his mouth. I examined the books, and selected Tom Jones and\nGoldsmith's Plays to take home. From that time I grazed at pleasure in\nhis oddly assorted library, ranging from \"The Gentleman's Magazine\"\nto a file of the \"Boston Recorder\"; but never a volume of poetry\nanywhere. I became a devourer of books which I could not digest, and\ntheir influence located in my mind curious and inconsistent relations\nbetween facts and ideas.\n\nMy music lessons in Milford were my only task. I remained inapt, while\nVeronica played better and better; when I saw her fingers interpreting\nher feelings, touching the keys of the piano as if they were the\nchords of her thoughts, practice by note seemed a soulless, mechanical\neffort, which I would not make. One day mother and I were reading the\nseparate volumes of charming Miss Austen's \"Mansfield Park,\" when a\nmessage arrived from Aunt Mercy, with the news of Grand'ther Warren's\ndangerous illness. Mother dropped her book on the floor, but I turned\ndown the leaf where I was reading. She went to Barmouth immediately,\nand the next day grand'ther died. He gave all he had to Aunt Mercy,\nexcept six silver spoons, which he directed the Barmouth silversmith\nto make for Caroline, who was now married to her missionary. Mother\ncame home to prepare for the funeral. When the bonnets, veils, and\nblack gloves came home, Veronica declared she would not go. As she had\nbeen allowed to stay away from Grand'ther Warren living, why should\nshe be forced to go to him when dead? She was so violent in her\nopposition that mother ordered Temperance to keep her in her room.\nFather tried to persuade her, but she grew white, and trembled so that\nhe told her she should stay at home. While we were gone she sent her\nbonnet to the Widow Smith's daughter, who appeared in the Poor Seats\nwearing it, on the very Sunday after the funeral, when we all went\nto church in our mourning to make the discovery, which discomposed us\nexceedingly.\n\nAll the church were present at grand'ther's funeral,--obsequies, as\nMr. Boold called it, who exalted his character and behavior so greatly\nin his discourse that his nearest friends would not have recognized\nhim, although everybody knew that he was a good man. Mr. Boold\nexpatiated on his tenderness and delicate appreciation, and his\nstudy of the feelings and wants of others, till he was moved to tears\nhimself by the picture he drew. I thought of the pigeons he had shot,\nand of the summary treatment he gave me--of his coldness and silence\ntoward Aunt Mercy, and my eyes remained dry; but mother and Aunt Mercy\nwept bitterly. After it was over, and they had gone back to the empty\nhouse, they removed their heavy bonnets, kissed each other, said they\nknew that he was in heaven, and held a comforting conversation about\nthe future; but my mind was chained to the edge of the yawning grave\ninto which I had seen his coffin lowered.\n\n\"Shut up the old shell, Mercy,\" said father. \"Come, and live with us.\"\n\nShe was rejoiced at the prospect, for the life at our house was\ncongenial, and she readily and gratefully consented. She came in a few\ndays, with a multitude of boxes, and her plants. Mother established\nher in the room next the stairs--good place for her, Veronica said,\nfor she could be easily locked out of our premises. The plants were\nplaced on a new revolving stand, which stood on the landing-place\nbeneath the stair window. Veronica was so delighted with them that she\nmade amicable overtures to Aunt Mercy, and never quarreled with her\nafterward, except when she was ill. She entreated her to leave off her\nbombazine dresses; the touch of them interfered with her feelings for\nher, she said; in fact, their contact made her crawl all over.\n\nAunt Mercy took upon herself many of mother's irksome cares; such\nas remembering where the patches and old linen were--the hammer and\nnails; watching the sweetmeat pots; keeping the run of the napkins and\nblankets; packing the winter clothing, and having an eye on mice and\nants, moth and mold. Occasionally she read a novel; but was faithful\nto all the week-day meetings, making the acquaintance thereby of\nmother's tea-drinking friends, who considered her an accomplished\nperson, because she worked lace so beautifully, and had _such_ a\nfaculty for raising plants! Mother left the house in her charge, and\nmade several journeys with father this year. This period was perhaps\nher happiest. The only annoyance, visible to me, that I can remember,\nwas one between her and father on the subject of charity. He was for\ngiving to all needy persons, while she only desired to bestow it on\nthe deserving, but they had renounced the wish of manufacturing\neach other's habits and opinions. Whether mother ever desired the\nexpression of that exaltation of feeling which only lasts in a man\nwhile he is in love, I cannot say. It was not for me to know her\nheart. It is not ordained that these beautiful secrets of feeling\nshould be revealed, where they might prove to be the sweetest\nknowledge we could have.\n\nThough the days flew by, days filled with the busy nothings of\nprosperity, they bore no meaning. I shifted the hours, as one shifts\nthe kaleidoscope, with an eye only to their movement. Neither the\nremembrance of yesterday nor the hope of to-morrow stimulated me. The\nmere fact of breathing had ceased to be a happiness, since the day I\nentered Miss Black's school. But I was not yet thoughtful. As for my\nposition, I was loved and I was hated, and it pleased me as much to be\nhated as to be loved. My acquaintances were kind enough to let me know\nthat I was generally thought proud, exacting, ill-natured, and apt\nto expect the best of everything. But one thing I know of myself\nthen--that I concealed nothing; the desires and emotions which are\nusually kept as a private fund I displayed and exhausted. My audacity\nshocked those who possessed this fund. My candor was called anything\nbut truthfulness; they named it sarcasm, cunning, coarseness, or tact,\nas those were constituted who came in contact with me. Insight into\ncharacter, frankness, generosity, disinterestedness, were sometimes\ngiven me. Veronica alone was uncompromising; she put aside by instinct\nwhat baffled or attracted others, and, setting my real value upon me,\nacted accordingly. I do not accuse her of injustice, but of a fierce\nharshness which kept us apart for long years. As for her, she was\nthe most reticent girl I ever knew, and but for her explosive temper,\nwhich betrayed her, she would have been a mystery. The difference in\nour physical constitutions would have separated us, if there had been\nno other cause. The weeks that she was confined to her room, preyed\nupon by some inscrutable disease, were weeks of darkness and solitude.\nTemperance and Aunt Merce took as much care of her as she would allow;\nbut she preferred being alone most of the time. Thus she acquired\nthe fortitude of an Indian; pain could extort no groan from her.\nIt reacted on her temper, though, for after an attack she was\nexasperating. Her invention was put to the rack to tease and offend.\nI kept out of her way; if by chance she caught sight of me, she forced\nme to hear the bitter truth of myself. Sometimes she examined me to\nlearn if I had improved by the means which father so _generously_\nprovided for me. \"Is he not yet tired of his task?\" she asked once.\nAnd, \"Do you carry everything before you, with your wide eyebrows and\nsharp teeth? Temperance, where's the Buffon Dr. Snell sent me? I want\nto classify Cass.\"\n\n\"I'll warrant you'll find her a sheep,\" Temperance replied.\n\n\"Sheep are innocent,\" said Veronica. \"You may go,\" nodding to me, over\nthe book, and Temperance also made energetic signs to me to go, and\nnot bother the poor girl.\n\nAlways regarding her from the point of view she presented, I felt\nlittle love for her; her peculiarities offended me as they did mother.\nWe did not perceive the process, but Verry was educated by sickness;\nher mind fed and grew on pain, and at last mastered it. The darkness\nin her nature broke; by slow degrees she gained health, though never\nmuch strength. Upon each recovery a change was visible; a spiritual\ndawn had risen in her soul; moral activity blending with her ideality\nmade her life beautiful, even in the humblest sense. Veronica! you\nwere endowed with genius; but while its rays penetrated you, we did\nnot see them. How could we profit by what you saw and heard, when we\nwere blind and deaf? To us, the voices of the deep sang no epic of\ngrief; the speech of the woods was not articulate; the sea-gull's\nflashing flight, and the dark swallow's circling sweep, were facts\nonly. Sunrise and sunset were not a paean to day and night, but five\no'clock A.M. or P.M. The seasons that came and went were changes\nfrom hot to cold; to you, they were the moods of nature, which found\nresponse in those of your own life and soul; her storms and calms were\npulses which bore a similitude to the emotions of your heart!\n\nVeronica's habits of isolation clung to her; she would never leave\nhome. The teaching she had was obtained in Surrey. But her knowledge\nwas greater than mine. When I went to Rosville she was reading\n\"Paradise Lost,\" and writing her opinions upon it in a large blank\nbook. She was also devising a plan for raising trees and flowers\nin the garret, so that she might realize a picture of a tropical\nwilderness. Her tastes were so contradictory that time never hung\nheavy with her; though she had as little practical talent as any\nperson I ever knew, she was a help to both sick and well. She\nremembered people's ill turns, and what was done for them; and for the\nwell she remembered dates and suggested agreeable occupations--gave\nthem happy ideas. Besides being a calendar of domestic traditions, she\nwas weather-wise, and prognosticated gales, meteors, high tides, and\nrains.\n\nHome, father said, was her sphere. All that she required, he thought\nhe could do; but of me he was doubtful. Where did I belong? he asked.\n\nI was still \"possessed,\" Aunt Merce said, and mother called me\n\"lawless.\" \"What upon earth are you coming to?\" asked Temperance. \"You\nare sowing your wild oats with a vengeance.\"\n\n\"Locke Morgeson's daughter can do anything,\" commented the villagers.\nIn consequence of the unlimited power accorded me I was unpopular.\n\"Do you think she is handsome?\" inquired my friends of each other. \"In\nwhat respect _can_ she be called a beauty?\" \"Though she reads, she\nhas no great wit,\" said one. \"She dresses oddly for effect,\" another\navowed, \"and her manners are ridiculous.\" But they borrowed my dresses\nfor patterns, imitated my bonnets, and adopted my colors. When I\nlearned to manage a sailboat, they had an aquatic mania. When I\nlearned to ride a horse, the ancient and moth-eaten sidesaddles of the\ntown were resuscitated, and old family nags were made back-sore\nwith the wearing of them, and their youthful spirits revived by new\nbeginners sliding about on their rounded sides. My whims were sneered\nat, and then followed. Of course I was driven from whim to whim, to\nkeep them busy, and to preserve my originality, and at last I became\neccentric for eccentricity's sake. All this prepared the way for my\nNemesis. But as yet my wild oats were green and flourishing in the\nfield of youth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\nI was preaching one day to mother and Aunt Merce a sermon after the\nmanner of Mr. Boold, of Barmouth, taking the sofa for a desk, and\nfor my text \"Like David's Harp of solemn sound,\" and had attracted\nTemperance and Charles into the room by my declamation, when my\naudience was unexpectedly increased by the entrance of father, with a\nstrange gentleman. Aunt Merce laughed hysterically; I waved my hand to\nher, _\u00c3\u00a0 la_ Boold, and descended from my position.\n\n\"Take a chair,\" said Temperance, who was never abashed, thumping one\ndown before the stranger.\n\n\"What is all this?\" inquired father.\n\n\"Only a _Ranz des Vaches_, father, to please Aunt Merce.\"\n\nThe stranger's eyes were fastened upon me, while father introduced us\nto \"Mr. Charles Morgeson, of Rosville.\"\n\n\"Please receive me as a relative,\" he said, turning to shake hands\nwith mother. \"We have an ancestor in common that makes a sufficient\ncousinship for a claim, Mrs. Morgeson.\"\n\n\"Why not have looked us up before?\" I asked.\n\n\"Why,\" said Veronica, who had just come in, \"there are six Charles\nMorgesons buried in our graveyard.\"\n\n\"I supposed,\" he said, \"that the name was extinct. I lately saw your\nfather's in a State Committee List, and feeling curious regarding it,\nI came here.\"\n\nHe bowed distantly to Veronica when she entered, but she did not\nreturn his bow, though she looked at him fixedly. Temperance and\nHepsey hurried up a fine supper immediately. A visitor was a creature\nto be fed. Feeding together removes embarrassment, and before supper\nwas over we were all acquainted with Mr. Morgeson. There were three\ncheerful old ladies spending the week with us--the widow Desire\nCarver, and her two maiden sisters, Polly and Serepta Chandler.\nThey filled the part of chorus in the domestic drama, saying, \"Aha,\"\nwhenever there was a pause. Veronica affected these old ladies\ngreatly, and when they were in the house gave them her society. But\nfor their being there at this time, I doubt whether she would have\nseen Mr. Morgeson again. That evening she played for them. Her wild,\npathetic melodies made our visitor's gray eyes flash with pleasure,\nand light up his cold face with gleams of feeling; but she was not\ngratified by his interest. \"I think it strange that you should like my\nmusic,\" she said crossly.\n\n\"Do you\" he answered, amused at her tone, \"perhaps it is; but why\nshould I not as well as your friends here?\" indicating the old ladies.\n\n\"Ah, we like it very much,\" said the three, clicking their\nsnuff-boxes.\n\n\"You, too, play?\" he asked me.\n\n\"Miss Cassy don't play,\" answered the three, looking at me over their\nspectacles. \"Miss Verry's sun puts out her fire.\"\n\n\"Cassandra does other things better than playing,\" Veronica said to\nMr. Morgeson.\n\n\"Why, Veronica,\" I said, surprised, going toward her.\n\n\"Go off, go off,\" she replied, in an undertone, and struck up a loud\nmarch. He had heard her, and while she played looked at her earnestly.\nThen, seeming to forget the presence of the three, he turned and put\nout his hand to me, with an authority I did not resist. I laid my hand\nin his; it was not grasped, but upheld. Veronica immediately stopped\nplaying.\n\nHe stayed several days at our house. After the first evening we found\nhim taciturn. He played with Arthur, spoke of his children to him,\nand promised him a pony if he would go to Rosville. With father he\ndiscussed business matters, and went out with him to the shipyards and\noffices. I scarcely remember that he spoke to me, except in a casual\nway, more than once. He asked me if I knew whether the sea had any\ninfluence upon me; I replied that I had not thought of it. \"There are\nso many things you have not thought of,\" he answered, \"that this is\nnot strange.\"\n\nVeronica observed him closely; he was aware of it, but was not\nembarrassed; he met her dark gaze with one keener than her own, and\nneither talked with the other. The morning he went away, while the\nchaise was waiting, which was to go to Milford to meet the stagecoach,\nand he was inviting us to visit him, a thought seemed to strike\nhim. \"By the way, Morgeson, why not give Miss Cassandra a finish at\nRosville? I have told you of our Academy, and of the advantages\nwhich Rosville affords in the way of society. What do you say, Mrs.\nMorgeson, will you let her come to my house for a year?\"\n\n\"Locke decides for Cassy,\" she answered; \"I never do now,\" looking at\nme reproachfully.\n\nCousin Charles's hawk eyes caught the look, and he heard me too, when\nI tapped her shoulder till she turned round and smiled. I whispered,\n\"Mother, your eyes are as blue as the sea yonder, and I love you.\" She\nglanced toward it; it was murmuring softly, creeping along the shore,\nlicking the rocks and sand as if recognizing a master. And I saw and\nfelt its steady, resistless heaving, insidious and terrible.\n\n\"Well,\" said father, \"we will talk of it on the way to Milford.\"\n\n\"I have a kinder of a-creeping about your Cousin Charles, as you call\nhim,\" said Temperance, after she had closed the porch door. \"He is too\nmuch shut up for me. How's Mis Cousin Charles, I wonder?\"\n\n\"He is fond of flowers,\" remarked Aunt Merce; \"he examined all my\nplants, and knew all their botanical names.\"\n\n\"That's a balm for every wound with you, isn't it?\" Temperance said.\n\"I spose I can clean the parlor, unless Mis Carver and Chandler are\nsitting in a row there?\"\n\nVeronica, who had hovered between the parlor and the hall while Cousin\nCharles was taking his leave, so that she might avoid the necessity\nof any direct notice of him, had heard his proposition about Rosville,\nsaid, \"Cassandra will go there.\"\n\n\"Do you feel it in your bones, Verry?\" Temperance asked.\n\n\"Cassandra does.\"\n\n\"Do I? I believe I do.\"\n\n\"You are eighteen; you are too old to go to school.\"\n\n\"But I am not too old to have an agreeable time; besides, I am not\neighteen, and shall not be till four days from now.\"\n\n\"You think too much of having a good time, Cassandra,\" said mother. \"I\nforesee the day when the pitcher will come back from the well broken.\nYou are idle and frivolous; eternally chasing after amusement.\"\n\n\"God knows I don't find it.\"\n\n\"I know you are not happy.\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" I cried, striking the table with my hand, making Veronica\nwink, \"tell me how to feel and act.\"\n\n\"I have no influence with you, nor with Veronica.\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Verry, \"we are all so different; but I like you,\nmother, and all that you do.\"\n\n\"Different!\" she exclaimed, \"children talk to parents about a\ndifference between them.\"\n\n\"I never thought about it before.\" I said, \"but _where_ is the family\nlikeness?\"\n\nAunt Merce laughed.\n\n\"There's the Morgesons,\" I continued, \"I hate 'em all.\"\n\n\"All?\" she echoed; \"you are like this new one.\"\n\n\"And Grand'ther Warren\"--I continued.\n\n\"Your talk,\" interrupted Aunt Merce, jumping up and walking about, \"is\nenough to make him rise out of his grave.\"\n\n\"I believe,\" said Veronica, \"that Grand'ther Warren nearly crushed\nyou and mother, when girls of our age. Did you know that you had any\nwants then? or dare to dream anything beside that he laid down for\nyou?\"\n\nAunt Merce and mother exchanged glances.\n\n\"Say, mother, what shall I do?\" I asked again.\n\n\"Do,\" she answered in a mechanical voice; \"read the Bible, and sew\nmore.\"\n\n\"Veronica's life is not misspent,\" she continued, and seeming to\nforget that Verry was still there. \"Why should she find work for her\nhands when neither you nor I do?\"\n\nVeronica slipped out of the room; and I sat on the floor beside\nmother. I loved her in an unsatisfactory way. What could we be to\neach other? We kissed tenderly; I saw she was saddened by something\nregarding me, which she could not explain, because she refused to\nexplain me naturally. I thought she wished me to believe she could\nhave no infirmity in common with me--no temptations, no errors--that\nshe must repress all the doubts and longings of her heart for\nexample's sake.\n\nThere was a weight upon me all that day, a dreary sense of\nimperfection.\n\nWhen father came home he asked me if I would like to go to Rosville.\nI answered, \"Yes.\" Mother must travel with me, for he could not leave\nhome. The sooner I went the better. He also thought Veronica should\ngo. She was called and consulted, and, provided Temperance would\naccompany us to take care of her, she consented. It was all arranged\nthat evening. Temperance said we must wait a week at least, for her\ncorns to be cured, and the plum-colored silk made, which had been shut\nup in a band-box for three years.\n\nWe started on our journey one bright morning in June, to go to Boston\nin a stagecoach, a hundred miles from Surrey, and thence to Rosville,\nforty miles further, by railroad. We stopped a night on the way\nto Boston at a country inn, which stood before an egg-shaped\npond. Temperance remade our beds, declaiming the while against the\nunwholesome situation of the house; the idea of anybody's living in\nthe vicinity of fresh water astonished her; to impose upon travelers'\nhealth that way was too much. She went to the kitchen to learn whether\nthe landlady cooked, or hired a cook. She sat up all night with our\nluggage in sight, to keep off what she called \"prowlers\"--she did\nnot like to say robbers, for fear of exciting our imaginations--and\nfrightened us by falling out of her chair toward morning. Veronica\ninsisted upon her going to bed, but she refused, till Veronica\nthreatened to sit up herself, when she carried her own carpet-bag to\nbed with her.\n\nWe arrived in Boston the next day and went to the Bromfield House in\nBromfield Street, whither father had directed us. We were ushered to\nthe parlor by a waiter, who seemed struck by Temperance, and who was\ntreated by her with respect. \"Mr. Shepherd, the landlord, himself, I\nguess,\" she whispered.\n\nThree cadaverous children were there eating bread and butter from a\nblack tray on the center-table.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" exclaimed Temperance, \"what bread those children are\neating! It is made of sawdust.\"\n\n\"It's good, you old cat,\" screamed the little girl.\n\nVeronica sat down by her, and offered her some sugar-plums, which the\nchild snatched from her hand.\n\n\"We are missionaries,\" said the oldest boy, \"and we are going to\nBombay next week in the _Cabot_. I'll make the natives gee, I tell\nye.\"\n\n\"Mercy on us!\" exclaimed Temperance, \"did you ever?\"\n\nPresently a sickly, gentle-looking man entered, in a suit of black\ncamlet, and carrying an umbrella; he took a seat by the children, and\nran his fingers through his hair, which already stood upright.\n\n\"That girl gave Sis some sugar-plums,\" remarked the boy.\n\n\"I hope you thanked her, Clarissa,\" said the father.\n\n\"No; she didn't give me enough,\" the child answered.\n\n\"They have no mother,\" the poor man said apologetically to Veronica,\nlooking up at her, and, as he caught her eye, blushing deeply. She\nbowed, and moved away. Mother rang the bell, and when the waiter came\ngave him a note for Mr. Shepherd, which father had written, bespeaking\nhis attention. Mr. Shepherd soon appeared, and conveyed us to two\npleasant rooms with an unmitigated view of the wall of the next house\nfrom the windows.\n\n\"This,\" remarked Temperance, \"is worse than the pond.\"\n\nMr. Shepherd complimented mother on her fine daughters; hoped Mr.\nMorgeson would run for Congress soon told her she should have the best\nthe house afforded, and retired.\n\nI wanted to shop, and mother gave me money. I found Washington Street,\nand bought six wide, embroidered belts, a gilt buckle, a variety of\nribbons, and a dozen yards of lace. I repented the whole before I got\nback; for I saw other articles I wanted more. I found mother alone;\nTemperance had gone out with Veronica, she said, and she had given\nVeronica the same amount of money, curious to know how she would\nspend it, as she had never been shopping. It was nearly dark when they\nreturned.\n\n\"I like Boston,\" said Verry.\n\n\"But what have you bought?\"\n\nShe displayed a beautiful gold chain, and a little cross for the\nthroat; a bundle of picture-books for the missionary children; a\nsewing-silk shawl for Hepsey, and some toys for Arthur.\n\n\"To-morrow, _I_ shall go shopping,\" said mother. \"What did you buy,\nTemperance?\"\n\n\"A mean shawl. In my opinion, Boston is a den of thieves.\"\n\nShe untied a box, from which she took a sky-blue silk shawl, with\nbrown flowers woven in it.\n\n\"I gave eighteen dollars for it, if I gave a cent, Mis Morgeson; I\nknow I am cheated. It's sleazy, isn't it?\"\n\nThe bell for tea rang, and Mr. Shepherd came up to escort us to the\ntable. Temperance delayed us, to tie on a silk apron, to protect\nthe plum-colored silk, for, as she observed to Mr. Shepherd, she was\nafraid it would show grease badly. I could not help exchanging smiles\nwith Mr. Shepherd, which made Veronica frown. The whole table stared\nas we seated ourselves, for we derived an importance from the fact\nthat we were under the personal charge of the landlord.\n\n\"How they gawk at you,\" whispered Temperance. I felt my color rise.\n\n\"The gentlemen do not guess that we are sisters,\" said Veronica\nquietly.\n\n\"How do I look?\" I asked.\n\n\"You know how, and that I do not agree with your opinion. You look\ncruel.\"\n\n\"I am cruel hungry.\"\n\nHer eyes sparkled with disdain.\n\n\"What do you mean to do for a year?\" I continued.\n\n\"Forget you, for one thing.\"\n\n\"I hope you wont be ill again, Verry.\"\n\n\"I shall be,\" she answered with a shudder; \"I need all the illnesses\nthat come.\"\n\n\"As for me,\" I said, biting my bread and butter, \"I feel well to my\nfingers' ends; they tingle with strength. I am elated with health.\"\n\nI had not spoken the last word before I became conscious of a streak\nof pain which cut me like a knife and vanished; my surprise at it was\nso evident that she asked me what ailed me.\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"I never had the feeling you speak of in my finger ends,\" she said\nsadly, looking at her slender hand.\n\n\"Poor girl!\"\n\n\"What has come over you, Cass? An attack of compassion? Are you\nmeaning to leave an amiable impression with me?\"\n\nAfter supper Mr. Shepherd asked mother if she would go to the theater.\nThe celebrated tragedian, Forrest, was playing; would the young ladies\nlike to see Hamlet? We all went, and my attention was divided between\nHamlet and two young men who lounged in the box door till Mr. Shepherd\nlooked them away. Veronica laughed at Hamlet, and Temperance said it\nwas stuff and nonsense. Veronica laughed at Ophelia, also, who was a\nsuperb, black-haired woman, toying with an elegant Spanish fan, which\nHamlet in his energy broke. \"It is not Shakespeare,\" she said.\n\n\"Has she read Shakespeare?\" I asked mother.\n\n\"I am sure I do not know.\"\n\nThat night, after mother and Veronica were asleep, I persuaded\nTemperance to get up, and bore my ears with a coarse needle, which I\nhad bought for the purpose. It hurt me so, when she pierced one, that\nI could not summon resolution to have the other operated on; so I went\nto bed with a bit of sewing silk in the hole she had made. But in the\nmorning I roused her, to tell her I thought I could bear to have the\nother ear bored. When mother appeared I showed her my ears red and\nsore, insisting that I must have a certain pair of white cornelian\near-rings, set in chased gold, and three inches long, which I had seen\nin a shop window. She scolded Temperance, and then gave me the money.\n\nThe next day mother and I started for Rosville. Veronica decided to\nremain in Boston with Temperance till mother returned. She said\nthat if she went she might find Mrs. Morgeson as disagreeable as Mr.\nMorgeson was; that she liked the Bromfield; besides, she wanted to see\nthe missionary children off for Bombay, and intended to go down to\nthe ship on the day they were to sail. She was also going to ask Mr.\nShepherd to look up a celebrated author for her. She must see one if\npossible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n\nIt was sunset when we arrived in Rosville, and found Mr. Morgeson\nwaiting for us with his carriage at the station. From its open sides\nI looked out on a tranquil, agreeable landscape; there was nothing\nsaline in the atmosphere. The western breeze, which blew in our faces,\nhad an earthy scent, with fluctuating streams of odors from trees and\nflowers. As we passed through the town, Cousin Charles pointed to the\nAcademy, which stood at the head of a green. Pretty houses stood round\nit, and streets branched from it in all directions. Flower gardens,\nshrubbery, and trees were scattered everywhere. Rosville was larger\nand handsomer than Surrey.\n\n\"That is my house, on the right,\" he said.\n\nWe looked down the shady street through which we were going, and saw a\nmodern cottage, with a piazza, and peaked roof, and on the side toward\nus a large yard, and stables.\n\nWe drove into the yard, and a woman came out on the piazza to receive\nus. It was Mrs. Morgeson, or \"My wife, Cousin Alice,\" as Mr. Morgeson\nintroduced her. Giving us a cordial welcome, she led us into a parlor\nwhere tea was waiting. A servant came in for our bonnets and baskets.\nCousin Alice begged us to take tea at once. We were hardly seated when\nwe heard the cry of a young child; she left the table hastily, to come\nback in a moment with an apology, which she made to Cousin Charles\nrather than to us. I had never seen a table so well arranged, so\nfastidiously neat; it glittered with glass and French china. Cousin\nCharles sent away a glass and a plate, frowning at the girl who\nwaited; there must have been a speck or a flaw in them. The viands\nwere as pretty as the dishes, the lamb chops were fragile; the bread\nwas delicious, but cut in transparent slices, and the butter pat was\nnearly stamped through with its bouquet of flowers. This was all the\nfeast except sponge cake, which felt like muslin in the fingers; I\ncould have squeezed the whole of it into my mouth. Still hungry, I\nobserved that Cousin Charles and Alice had finished; and though she\nshook her spoon in the cup, feigning to continue, and he snipped\ncrumbs in his plate, I felt constrained to end my repast. He rose\nthen, and pushing back folding-doors, we entered a large room, leaving\nAlice at the table. Windows extending to the floor opening on the\npiazza, but notwithstanding the stream of light over the carpet, I\nthought it somber, and out of keeping with the cottage exterior. The\nwalls were covered with dark red velvet paper, the furniture was\ndark, the mantel and table tops were black marble, and the vases\nand candelabra were bronze. He directed mother's attention to the\nportraits of his children, explaining them, while I went to a table\nbetween the windows to examine the green and white sprays of\nsome delicate flower I had never before seen. Its fragrance was\nintoxicating. I lifted the heavy vase which contained it; it was taken\nfrom me gently by Charles, and replaced.\n\n\"It will hardly bear touching,\" he said. \"By to-morrow these little\nwhite bells will be dead.\"\n\nI looked up at him. \"What a contrast!\" I said.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Here, in this room, and in you.\"\n\n\"And between you and me?\"\n\nHis face was serene, dark, and delicate, but to look at it made me\nshiver. Mother came toward us, pleading fatigue as an excuse for\nretiring, and Cousin Charles called Cousin Alice, who went with us to\nour room. In the morning, she said, we should see her three children.\nShe never left them, she was so afraid of their being ill, also\ntelling mother that she would do all in her power to make my stay in\nRosville pleasant and profitable. As a mother, she could appreciate\nher anxiety and sadness in leaving me. Mother thanked her warmly, and\nwas sure that I should be happy; but I had an inward misgiving that I\nshould not have enough to eat.\n\n\"I hear Edward,\" said Alice. \"Good-night.\"\n\nPresently a girl, the same who had taken our bonnets, came in with\na pitcher of warm water and a plate of soda biscuit. She directed us\nwhere to find the apparel she had nicely smoothed and folded; took off\nthe handsome counterpane, and the pillows trimmed with lace, putting\nothers of a plainer make in their places; shook down the window\ncurtains; asked us if we would have anything more, and quietly\ndisappeared. I offered mother the warm water, and appropriated the\nbiscuits. There were six. I ate every one, undressing meanwhile, and\nsurveying the apartment.\n\n\"Cassy, Mrs. Morgeson is an excellent housekeeper.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said huskily, for the dry biscuit choked me.\n\n\"What would Temperance and Hepsey say to this?\"\n\n\"I think they would grumble, and admire. Look at this,\" showing her\nthe tassels of the inner window curtains done up in little bags. \"And\nthe glass is pinned up with nice yellow paper; and here is a damask\nnapkin fastened to the wall behind the washstand. And everything\nstands on a mat. I wonder if this is to be my room?\"\n\n\"It is probably the chamber for visitors. Why, these are beautiful\npillow-cases, too,\" she exclaimed, as she put her head on the pillow.\n\"Come to bed; don't read.\"\n\nI had taken up a red morocco-bound book, which was lying alone on the\nbureau. It was Byron, and turning over the leaves till I came to\nDon Juan, I read it through, and began Childe Harold, but the candle\nexpired. I struck out my hands through the palpable darkness, to find\nthe bed without disturbing mother, whose soul was calmly threading\nthe labyrinth of sleep. I finished Childe Harold early in the morning,\nthough, and went down to breakfast, longing to be a wreck!\n\nThe three children were in the breakfast-room, which was not the one\nwe had taken tea in, but a small apartment, with a door opening\ninto the garden. They were beautifully dressed, and their mother was\ntending and watching them. The oldest was eight years, the youngest\nthree months. Cousin Alice gave us descriptions of their tastes and\nhabits, dwelling with emphasis on those of the baby. I drew from her\nconversation the opinion that she had a tendency to the rearing of\nchildren. I was glad when Cousin Charles came in, looking at his\nwatch. \"Send off the babies, Alice, and ring the bell for breakfast.\"\n\nShe sent out the two youngest, put little Edward in his chair, and\nbreakfast began.\n\n\"Mrs. Morgeson,\" said Charles, \"the horses will be ready to take you\nround Rosville. We will call on Dr. Price, for you to see the kind\nof master Cassandra will have. I have already spoken to him about\nreceiving a new pupil.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am homesick at the idea of school and a master,\" I said.\n\nMother tried in vain to look hard-hearted, and to persuade that it was\ngood for me, but she lost her appetite, with the thought of losing me,\nwhich the mention of Dr. Price brought home. The breakfast was as well\nadapted to a delicate taste as the preceding supper. The ham was most\nsavory, but cut in such thin slices that it curled; and the biscuits\nwere as white and feathery as snowflakes. I think also that the boiled\neggs were smaller than any I had seen. Cousin Alice gave unremitting\nattention to Edward, who ate as little as the rest.\n\n\"Mother,\" I said afterward, \"I am afraid I am an animal. Did you\nnotice how little the Morgesons ate?\"\n\n\"I noticed how elegant their table appointments were, and I shall buy\nnew china in Boston to-morrow. I wish Hepsey would not load our table\nas she does.\"\n\n\"Hepsey is a good woman, mother; do give my love to her. Now that\nI think of it, she was always making up some nice dish; tell her I\nremember it, will you?\"\n\nWhen Cousin Charles put us into the carriage, and hoisted little\nEdward on the front seat, mother noticed that two men held the horses,\nand that they were not the same he had driven the night before. She\nsaid she was afraid to go, they looked ungovernable; but he reassured\nher, and one of the men averring that Mr. Morgeson could drive\nanything, she repressed her fears, and we drove out of the yard\nbehind a pair of horses that stood on their hind legs as often as that\nposition was compatible with the necessity they were under of getting\non, for they evidently understood that they were guided by a firm\nhand. Edward was delighted with their behavior, and for the first time\nI saw his father smile on him.\n\n\"These are fine brutes,\" he said, not taking his eyes from them; \"but\nthey are not equal to my mare, Nell. Alice is afraid of her; but I\nhope that you, Cassandra, will ride with me sometimes when I drive\nher.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed mother, grasping my arm.\n\n\"You would, would you?\" he said, taking out the whip, as the horses\nrecoiled from a man who lay by the roadside, leaping so high that the\nharness seemed rattling from their backs. He struck them, and\nsaid, \"Go on now, go on, devils.\" There was no further trouble. He\nencouraged mother not to be afraid, looking keenly at me. I looked\nback at him.\n\n\"How much worse is the mare, cousin Charles?\"\n\n\"You shall see.\"\n\nAfter driving round the town we stopped at the Academy. Morning\nprayers were over, and the scholars, some sixty boys and girls, were\ncoming downstairs from the hall, to go into the rooms, each side of a\ngreat door. Dr. Price was behind them. He stopped when he saw us,\nan introduction took place, and he inquired for Dr. Snell, as an old\ncollege friend. Locke Morgeson sounded familiarly, he said; a member\nof his mother's family named Somers had married a gentleman of that\nname. He remembered it from an old ivory miniature which his mother\nhad shown him, telling him it was the likeness of her cousin Rachel's\nhusband. I replied we knew that grandfather had married a Rachel\nSomers. Cousin Charles was surprised and a little vexed that the\ndoctor had never told him, when he must have known that he had been\nanxiously looking up the Morgeson pedigree; but the doctor declared\nhe had not thought of it before, and that only the name of Locke had\nrecalled it to his mind. He then proposed our going to Miss Prior, the\nlady who had charge of the girls' department, and we followed him to\nher school-room.\n\nI was at once interested and impressed by the appearance of my teacher\nthat was to be. She was a dignified, kind-looking woman, who asked me\na few questions in such a pleasant, direct manner that I frankly told\nher I was eighteen years old, very ignorant, and averse from learning;\nbut I did not speak loud enough for anybody beside herself to hear.\n\n\"Now,\" said mother, when we came away, \"think how much greater your\nadvantages are than mine have ever been. How miserable was my youth!\nIt is too late for me to make any attempt at cultivation. I have\nno wish that way. Yet now I feel sometimes as if I were leaving the\nconfines of my old life to go I know not whither, to do I know not\nwhat.\"\n\nBut her countenance fell when she heard that Dr. Price had been a\nUnitarian minister, and that there was no Congregational church in\nRosville.\n\nShe went to Boston that Friday afternoon, anxious to get safely home\nwith Veronica. We parted with many a kiss and shake of the hand and\nlast words. I cried when I went up to my room, for I found a present\nthere--a beautiful workbox, and in it was a small Bible with my name\nand hers written on the fly-leaf in large print-like, but tremulous\nletters. I composed my feelings by putting it away carefully and\nunpacking my trunk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\nRosville was a county town. The courts were held there, and its\nsociety was adorned with several lawyers of note who had law students,\nwhich fact was to the lawyers' daughters the most agreeable feature\nof their fathers' profession. It had a weekly market day and an\nannual cattle show. I saw a turnout of whips and wagons about the\nhitching-posts round the green of a Tuesday the year through, and\ngoing to and from school met men with a bovine smell. Caucuses were\nprevalent, and occasionally a State Convention was held, when Rosville\npaid honor to some political hero of the day with banners and brass\nbands. It was a favorite spot for the rustication of naughty boys from\nHarvard or Yale. Dr. Price had one or two at present who boarded in\nhis house so as to be immediately under his purblind eyes, and who\ntook Greek and Latin at the Academy.\n\nSocial feuds raged in the Academy coteries between the collegians\nand the natives on account of the superior success of the former in\nflirtation. The latter were not consoled by their experience that no\nflirtation lasted beyond the period of rustication. Dr. Price usually\nhad several young men fitting for college also, which fact added more\npiquancy to the provincial society. In the summer riding parties were\nfashionable, and in the winter county balls and cotillion parties;\na professor came down from Boston at this season to set up a dancing\nschool, which was always well attended.\n\nThe secular concerns of life engaged the greatest share of the\ninterests of its inhabitants; and although there existed social and\nprofessional dissensions, there was little sectarian spirit among them\nand no religious zeal. The rich and fashionable were Unitarians.\nThe society owned a tumble-down church; a mild preacher stood in its\npulpit and prayed and preached, sideways and slouchy. This degree of\nreligious vitality accorded with the habits of its generations. Surrey\nand Barmouth would have howled over the Total Depravity of Rosville.\nThere was no probationary air about it. Human Nature was the\ninfallible theme there. At first I missed the vibration of the moral\nsword which poised in our atmosphere. When I felt an emotion without\nseeing the shadow of its edge turning toward me, I discovered my\nconscience, which hitherto had only been described to me.\n\nThere were churches in the town beside the Unitarian. The\nUniversalists had a bran-new one, and there was still another\nfrequented by the sedimentary part of the population--Methodists.\n\nI toned down perfectly within three months. Soon after my arrival at\nhis house I became afraid of Cousin Charles. Not that he ever said\nanything to justify fear of him--he was more silent at home than\nelsewhere; but he was imperious, fastidious, and sarcastic with me by\na look, a gesture, an inflection of his voice. My perception of any\ndefect in myself was instantaneous with his discovery of it. I fell\ninto the habit of guessing each day whether I was to offend or please\nhim, and then into that of intending to please. An intangible, silent,\nmagnetic feeling existed between us, changing and developing according\nto its own mysterious law, remaining intact in spite of the contests\nbetween us of resistance and defiance. But my feeling died or\nslumbered when I was beyond the limits of his personal influence. When\nin his presence I was so pervaded by it that whether I went contrary\nto the dictates of his will or not I moved as if under a pivot; when\naway my natural elasticity prevailed, and I held the same relation to\nothers that I should have held if I had not known him. This continued\ntill the secret was divined, and then his influence was better\nremembered.\n\nI discovered that there was little love between him and Alice. I never\nheard from either an expression denoting that each felt an interest\nin the other's individual life; neither was there any of that conjugal\nfreemasonry which bores one so to witness. But Alice was not unhappy.\nHer ideas of love ended with marriage; what came afterward--children,\nhousekeeping, and the claims of society--sufficed her needs. If she\nhad any surplus of feeling it was expended upon her children, who had\nmuch from her already, for she was devoted and indulgent to them.\nIn their management she allowed no interference, on this point only\nthwarting her husband. In one respect she and Charles harmonized; both\nwere worldly, and in all the material of living there was sympathy.\nTheir relation was no unhappiness to him; he thought, I dare say,\nif he thought at all, that it was a natural one. The men of his\nacquaintance called him a lucky man, for Alice was handsome,\nkind-hearted, intelligent, and popular.\n\nWhether Cousin Alice would have found it difficult to fulfill\nthe promise she made mother regarding me, if I had been a plain,\nunnoticeable girl, I cannot say, or whether her anxiety that I should\nmake an agreeable impression would have continued beyond a few days.\nShe looked after my dress and my acquaintances. When she found that\nI was sought by the young people of her set and the Academy, she was\ngratified, and opened her house for them, giving little parties and\nlarge ones, which were pleasant to everybody except Cousin Charles,\nwho detested company--\"it made him lie so.\" But he was very well\nsatisfied that people should like to visit and praise his house and\nits belongings, if Alice would take the trouble of it upon herself. I\nmade calls with her Wednesday afternoons, and went to church with\nher Sunday mornings. At home I saw little of her. She was almost\nexclusively occupied with the children--their ailments or their\npleasures--and staid in her own room, or the nursery.\n\nWhen in the house I never occupied one spot long, but wandered in the\ngarden, which had a row of elms, or haunted the kitchen and stables,\nto watch black Phoebe, the cook, or the men as they cleaned the horses\nor carriages. My own room was in a wing of the cottage, with a window\noverlooking the entrance into the yard and the carriage drive; this\nwas its sole view, except the wall of a house on the other side of a\nhigh fence. I heard Charles when he drove home at night, or away in\nthe morning; knew when Nell was in a bad humor by the tone of his\nvoice, which I heard whether my window was open or shut. It was\na pretty room, with a set of maple furniture, and amber and white\nwallpaper, and amber and white chintz curtains and coverings. It\nsuited the color of my hair, Alice declared, and was becoming to my\ncomplexion.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Charles, looking at my hair with an expression that\nmade me put my hand up to my head as if to hide it; I knew it was\ncarelessly dressed.\n\nI made a study that day of the girls' heads at school, and from that\ntime improved in my style of wearing it, and I brushed it with zeal\nevery day afterward. Alice had my room kept so neatly for me that it\nsoon came to be a reproach, and I was finally taught by her example\nhow to adjust chairs, books, and mats in straight lines, to fold\narticles without making odd corners and wrinkles; at last I improved\nso much that I could find what I was seeking in a drawer, without\nharrowing it with my fingers, and began to see beauty in order. Alice\nhad a talent for housekeeping, and her talent was fostered by the\nexacting, systematic taste of her husband. He examined many matters\nwhich are usually left to women, and he applied his business talent to\nthe art of living, succeeding in it as he did in everything else.\n\nAlice told me that Charles had been poor; that his father was never on\ngood terms with him. She fancied they were too much alike; so he had\nturned him off to shift for himself, when quite young. When she met\nhim, he was the agent of a manufacturing company, in the town where\nher parents lived, and even then, in his style of living, he surpassed\nthe young men of her acquaintance. The year before they were married\nhis father died, and as Charles was his only child, he left his farm\nto him, and ten thousand dollars--all he had. The executors of the\nwill were obliged to advertise for him, not having any clue to his\nplace of residence. He sold the farm as soon as it was put in his\nhands, took the ten thousand dollars, and came back to be married.\nA year after, he went to Rosville, and built a cotton factory, three\nmiles from town, and the cottage, and then brought her and Edward, who\nwas a few months old, to live in it. He had since enlarged the works,\nemployed more operatives, and was making a great deal of money.\nMorgeson's Mills, she believed, were known all over the country.\nCharles was his own agent, as well as sole owner. There were no mills\nbeside his in the neighborhood; to that fact she ascribed the reason\nof his having no difficulties in Rosville, and no enmities; for she\nknew he had no wish to make friends. The Rosville people, having no\nbusiness in common with him, had no right to meddle, and could find\nbut small excuse for comment. They spent, she said, five or six\nthousand a year; most of it went in horses, she was convinced, and\nshe believed his flowers cost him a great deal too. \"You must know,\nCassandra, that his heart is with his horses and his flowers. He is\nmore interested in them than he is in his children.\"\n\nShe looked vexed when she said this; but I took hold of the edge\nof her finely embroidered cape, and asked her how much it cost. She\nlaughed, and said, \"Fifty dollars; but you see how many lapels it has.\nI have still a handsomer one that was seventy-five.\"\n\n\"Are they a part of the six thousand a year, Alice?\"\n\n\"Of course; but Charles wishes me to dress, and never stints me in\nmoney; and, after all, I like for him to spend his money in his own\nway. It vexes me sometimes, he buys such wild brutes, and endangers\nhis life with them. He rides miles and miles every year; and it\nrelieves the tedium of his journeys to have horses he must watch, I\nsuppose.\"\n\nNobody in Rosville lived at so fast a rate as the Morgesons. The\noldest families there were not the richest--the Ryders, in particular.\nJudge Ryder had four unmarried daughters; they were the only girls\nin our set who never invited us to visit them. They could not help\nsaying, with a fork of the neck, \"Who are the Morgesons?\" But all the\nothers welcomed Cousin Alice, and were friendly with me. She was too\npretty and kind-hearted not to be liked, if she was rich; and Cousin\nCharles was respected, because he made no acquaintance beyond bows,\nand \"How-de-do's.\" It was rather a stirring thing to have such a\ncitizen, especially when he met with an accident, and he broke many\ncarriages in the course of time; and now and then there was a row at\nthe mills, which made talk. His being considered a hard man did not\ndetract from the interest he inspired.\n\nMy advent in Rosville might be considered a fortunate one; appearances\nindicated it; I am sure I thought so, and was very well satisfied with\nmy position. I conformed to the ways of the family with ease, even in\nthe matter of small breakfasts and light suppers. I found that I was\nmore elastic than before, and more susceptible to sudden impressions;\nI was conscious of the ebb and flow of blood through my heart, felt\nit when it eddied up into my face, and touched my brain with its\nflame-colored wave. I loved life again. The stuff of which each day\nwas woven was covered with an arabesque which suited my fancy. I\nmissed nothing that the present unrolled for me, but looked neither\nto the past nor to the future. In truth there was little that was\nelevated in me. Could I have perceived it if there had been? Whichever\nway the circumstances of my life vacillated, I was not yet reached to\nthe quick; whether spiritual or material influences made sinuous the\ncurrent of being, it still flowed toward an undiscovered ocean.\n\nHalf the girls at the Academy, like myself, came from distant towns.\nSome had been there three years. They were all younger than myself.\nThere never had been a boarding-house attached to the school, and it\nwas not considered a derogatory thing for the best families to receive\nthese girls as boarders. We were therefore on the same footing, in a\nsocial sense. I was also on good terms with Miss Prior. She was a cold\nand kindly woman, faithful as a teacher, gifted with an insight into\nthe capacity of a pupil. She gave me a course of History first, and\nafter that Physical Philosophy; but never recommended me to Moral\nScience. When I had been with her a few months, she proposed that I\nshould study the common branches; my standing in the school was such\nthat I went down into the primary classes without shame, and I must\nsay that I was the dullest scholar in them. We also had a drawing\nmaster and a music-teacher. The latter was an amiable woman, with\ntheatrical manners. She was a Mrs. Lane; but no Mr. Lane had ever been\nseen in Rosville. We girls supposed he had deserted her, which was\nthe fact, as she told me afterward. She cried whenever she sang a\nsentimental song, but never gave up to her tears, singing on with\nblinded eyes and quavering voice. I laughed at her dresses which had\nbeen handsome, with much frayed trimming about them, the hooks and\neyes loosened and the seams strained, but liked her, and although\nI did not take lessons, saw her every day when she came up to the\nAcademy. She asked me once if I had any voice. I answered her by\nsinging one of our Surrey hymns, \"_Once on the raging seas he rode_.\"\nShe grew pale, and said, \"Don't for heaven's sake sing that! I can\nsee my old mother, as she looked when she sang that hymn of a stormy\nnight, when father was out to sea. Both are dead now, and where am I?\"\n\nShe turned round on the music stool, and banged out the accompaniment\nof \"_O pilot, 'tis a fearful night_,\" and sang it with great energy.\nAfter her feelings were composed, she begged me to allow her to\nteach me to sing. \"You can at least learn the simple chords of\nsong accompaniments, and I think you have a voice that can be made\neffective.\"\n\nI promised to try, and as I had taken lessons before, in three months\nI could play and sing \"_Should those fond hopes e'er forsake thee_,\"\ntolerably well. But Mrs. Lane persisted in affirming that I had\na dramatic talent, and as she supposed that I never should be an\nactress, I must bring it out in singing; so I persevered, and, thanks\nto her, improved so much that people said, when I was mentioned, \"She\nsings.\"\n\nThe Moral Sciences went to Dr. Price, and he had a class of girls\nin Latin; but my only opportunity of going before him was at morning\nprayers and Wednesday afternoons, when we assembled in the hall to\nhear orations in Latin, or translations, and \"pieces\" spoken by the\nboys; and at the quarterly reviews, when he marched us backward and\nforward through the books we had conned, like the sharp old gentleman\nhe was, notwithstanding his purblind eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n\nI heard from home regularly; father, however, was my only\ncorrespondent. He stipulated that I should write him every other\nSaturday, if not more than a line; but I did more than that at first,\nwriting up the events of the fortnight, interspersing my opinions of\nthe actors engaged therein, and dwindling by degrees down to the mere\nacknowledgment of his letter. He read without comment, but now and\nthen he asked me questions which puzzled me to answer.\n\n\"Do you like Mr. Morgeson?\" he asked once.\n\n\"He is very attentive,\" I wrote back. \"But so is Cousin Alice,--she is\nfond of me.\"\n\n\"You do not like Morgeson?\" again.\n\n\"Are there no agreeable young men,\" he asked another time, \"with Dr.\nPrice?\"\n\n\"Only boys,\" I wrote--\"cubs of my own age.\"\n\nAmong the first letters I received was one with the news of the death\nof my grandfather, John Morgeson. He had left ten thousand dollars\nfor Arthur, the sum to be withdrawn from the house of Locke Morgeson\n& Co., and invested elsewhere, for the interest to accumulate, and\nbe added to the principal, till he should be of age. The rest of\nhis property he gave to the Foreign Missionary Society. \"Now,\" wrote\nfather, \"it will come your turn next, to stand in the gap, when your\nmother and I fall back from the forlorn hope--life.\" This merry and\nunaccustomed view of things did not suggest to my mind the change\nhe intimated; I could not dwell on such an idea, so steadfast\na home-principle were father and mother. It was different with\ngrandfathers and grandmothers, of course; they died, since it was\nnot particularly necessary for them to live after their children were\nmarried.\n\nIt was early June when I went to Rosville; it was now October. There\nwas nothing more for me to discover there. My relations at home and\nat school were established, and it was probable that the next year's\nplans were all settled.\n\n\"It is the twentieth,\" said my friend, Helen Perkins, as we lingered\nin the Academy yard, after school hours. \"The trees have thinned so\nwe can see up and down the streets. Isn't that Mr. Morgeson who\nis tearing round the corner of Gold Street? Do you think he is\nstrange-looking? I do. His hair, and eyes, and complexion are exactly\nthe same hue; what color is it? A pale brown, or a greenish gray?\"\n\n\"Is he driving this way?\"\n\n\"Yes; the fore-legs of his horse have nearly arrived.\"\n\nI moved on in advance of Helen, toward the gate; he beckoned when he\nsaw me, and presently reined Nell close to us. \"You can decide now\nwhat color he is,\" I whispered to her.\n\n\"Will you ride home?\" he asked. \"And shall I take you down to\nBancroft's, Miss Helen?\"\n\nShe would have declined, but I took her arm, pushed her into the\nchaise, and then sprang in after her; she seized the hand-loop, in\nview of an upset.\n\n\"You are afraid of my horse, Miss Helen,\" he said, without having\nlooked at her.\n\n\"I am afraid of your driving,\" she answered, leaning back and looking\nbehind him at me. She shook her head and put her finger on her eyelid\nto make me understand that she did not like the color of his eyes.\n\n\"Cassandra is afraid of neither,\" he said.\n\n\"Why should I be?\" I replied coldly.\n\nWe were soon at the Bancrofts', where Helen lived, which was a mile\nfrom the Academy, and half a mile from our house. When we were going\nhome, he asked:\n\n\"Is she your intimate friend?\"\n\n\"The most in school.\"\n\n\"Is there the usual nonsense about her?\"\n\n\"What do you mean by nonsense?\"\n\n\"When a girl talks about her lover or proposes one to her friend.\"\n\n\"I think she is not gifted that way.\"\n\n\"Then I like her.\"\n\n\"Why should she not talk about lovers, though? The next time I see her\nI will bring up the subject.\"\n\n\"You shall think and talk of your lessons, and nothing more, I charge\nyou. Go on, Nell,\" he said, in a loud voice, turning into the yard\nand grazing one of the gate-posts, so that we struck together. I was\nvexed, thinking it was done purposely, and brushed my shoulder where\nhe came in contact, as if dust had fallen on me, and jumped out\nwithout looking at him, and ran into the house.\n\n\"Are you losing your skill in driving, Charles?\" Alice asked, when we\nwere at tea, \"or is Nell too much for you? I saw you crash against the\ngate-post.\"\n\n\"Did you? My hand was not steady, and we made a lurch.\"\n\n\"Was there a fight at the mills last night? Jesse said so.\"\n\n\"Jesse must mind his business.\"\n\n\"He told Phoebe about it.\"\n\n\"I knocked one of the clerks over and sprained my wrist.\"\n\nI met his eye then. \"It was your right hand?\" I asked.\n\n\"It was my right hand,\" in a deferential tone, and with a slight bow\nin my direction.\n\n\"Was it Parker?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes, he is a puppy; but don't talk about it.\"\n\nNothing more was said, even by Edward, who observed his father with\nchildish gravity, I meditated on the injustice I had done him about\nthe gate-post. After tea he busied himself in the garden among the\nflowers which were still remaining. I lingered in the parlor or walked\nthe piazza with an undefined desire of speaking to him before I should\ngo to my room. After he had finished his garden work he went to the\nstable; I heard the horses stepping about the floor as they were\ntaken out for his inspection. The lamps were lighted before he came in\nagain; Alice was upstairs as usual. When I heard him coming, I opened\nmy book, and seated myself in a corner of a sofa; he walked to the\nwindow without noticing me, and drummed on the piano.\n\n\"Does your wrist pain you, Charles?\" still reading.\n\n\"A trifle,\" adjusting his wristband.\n\n\"Do you often knock men down in your employ?\"\n\n\"When they deserve it.\"\n\n\"It is a generous and manly sort of pastime.\"\n\n\"I am a generous man and very strong; do you know that, you little\nfool? Here, will you take this flower? There will be no more this\nyear.\" I took it from his hand; it was a pink, faintly odorous\nblossom.\n\n\"I love these fragile flowers best,\" he continued--\"where I have to\nprotect them from my own touch, even.\" He relapsed into forgetfulness\nfor a moment, and then began to study his memorandum book.\n\n\"A note from the mills, sir,\" said Jesse, \"by one of the hands.\"\n\n\"Tell him to wait.\"\n\nHe read it, and threw it over to me. It was from Parker, who informed\nMr. Morgeson that he was going by the morning's train to Boston,\nthinking it was time for him to leave his employ; that, though the\nfault was his own in the difficulty of the day before, a Yankee could\nnot stand a knock-down. It was too damned aristocratic for an employer\nto have that privilege; our institutions did not permit it. He thanked\nMr. Morgeson for his liberality; he couldn't thank him for being\na good fellow. \"And would he oblige him by sending per bearer the\narrears of salary?\"\n\n\"Parker is in love with a factory girl. He quarreled with one of the\nhands because he was jealous of him, and would have been whipped by\nthe man and his friends; to spare him that, I knocked him down. Do you\nfeel better now, Cassy?\"\n\n\"Better? How does it concern me?\"\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\"Put Black Jake in the wagon,\" he called to Jesse.\n\nAlice heard him and came downstairs; we went out on the _piazza_, to\nsee him off. \"Why do you go?\" she asked, in an uneasy tone.\n\n\"I must. Wont you go too?\"\n\nShe refused; but whispered to me, asking if I were afraid?\n\n\"Of what?\"\n\n\"Men quarreling.\"\n\n\"Cassandra, will you go?\" he asked. \"If not, I am off. Jump in behind,\nSam, will you?\"\n\n\"Go,\" said Alice; and she ran in for a shawl, which she wrapped round\nme.\n\n\"Alice,\" said Charles, \"you are a silly woman.\"\n\n\"As you have always said,\" she answered, laughing. \"Ward the blows\nfrom him, Cassandra.\"\n\n\"It's a pretty dark night for a ride,\" remarked Sam.\n\n\"I have rode in darker ones.\"\n\n\"I dessay,\" replied Sam.\n\n\"Cover your hand with my handkerchief,\" I said; \"the wind is cutting.\"\n\n\"Do you wish it?\"\n\n\"No, I do not wish it; it was a humanitary idea merely.\"\n\nHe refused to have it covered.\n\nThe air had a moldy taint, and the wind blew the dead leaves around\nus. As we rode through the darkness I counted the glimmering lights\nwhich flashed across our way till we got out on the high-road where\nthey grew scarce, and the wind whistled loud about our faces. He laid\nhis hand on my shawl. \"It is too light; you will take cold.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nWe reached the mills, and pulled up by the corner of a building, where\na light shone through a window.\n\n\"This is my office. You must go in--it is too chilly for you to wait\nin the wagon. Hold Jake, Sam, till I come back.\"\n\nI followed him. In the farthest corner of the room where we had\nseen the light, behind the desk, sat Mr. Parker, with his light hair\nrumpled, and a pen behind his ear.\n\nI stopped by the door, while Charles went to the desk and stood before\nhim to intercept my view, but he could not help my hearing what was\nsaid, though he spoke low.\n\n\"Did you give something to Sam, Parker, for bringing me your note at\nsuch a late hour?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" in a loud voice.\n\n\"He must be fifty, at least.\"\n\n\"I should say so,\" rather lower.\n\n\"Well, here is your money; you had better stay. I shall be devilish\nsorry for your father, who is my friend; you know he will be\ndisappointed if you leave; depend upon it he will guess at the girl.\nOf course you would like to have me say I was in fault about giving\nyou a blow--as I was. Stay. You will get over the affair. We all do.\nIs she handsome?\"\n\n\"Beautiful,\" in a meek but enthusiastic tone.\n\n\"That goes, like the flowers; but they come every year again.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Yes, I say.\"\n\n\"No; I'll stay and see.\"\n\nCharles turned away.\n\n\"Good-evening, Mr. Parker,\" I said, stepping forward. I had met him at\nseveral parties at Rosville, but never at our house.\n\n\"Excuse me, Miss Morgeson; I did not know you. I hope you are well.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Charles, with his hand on the latch.\n\n\"Are you going to Mrs. Bancroft's whist party on Wednesday night, Mr.\nParker?\"\n\n\"Yes; Miss Perkins was kind enough to invite me.\"\n\n\"Cassandra, come.\" And Charles opened the door. I fumbled for the\nflower at my belt. \"It's nice to have flowers so late; don't you think\nso?\" inhaling the fragrance of my crushed specimens; \"if they would\nbut last. Will you have it?\" stretching it toward him. He was about\nto take it, with a blush, when Charles struck it out of my hand and\nstepped on it.\n\n\"Are you ready now?\" he said, in a quick voice.\n\nI declared it was nothing, when I found I was too ill to rise the next\nmorning. At the end of three days, as I still felt a disinclination to\nget up, Alice sent for her physician. I told him I was sleepy and felt\ndull pains. He requested me to sit up in bed, and rapped my shoulders\nand chest with his knuckles, in a forgetful way.\n\n\"Nothing serious,\" he said; \"but, like many women, you will continue\nto do something to keep in continual pain. If Nature does not endow\nyour constitution with suffering, you will make up the loss by some\nfatal trifling, which will bring it. I dare say, now, that after this,\nyou never will be quite well.\"\n\n\"I will take care of my health.\"\n\nHe looked into my face attentively.\n\n\"You wont--you can't. Did you ever notice your temperament?\"\n\n\"No, never; what is it?\"\n\n\"How old are you?\"\n\n\"Eighteen, and four months.\"\n\n\"Is it possible? How backward you are! You are quite interesting.\"\n\n\"When may I get up?\"\n\n\"Next week; don't drink coffee. Remember to live in the day. Avoid\nstirring about in the night, as you would avoid Satan. Sleep, sleep\nthen, and you'll make that beauty of yours last longer.\"\n\n\"Am I a beauty? No living creature ever said so before.\"\n\n\"Adipose beauty.\"\n\n\"Fat?\"\n\n\"No; not that exactly. Good-day.\"\n\nHe came again, and asked me questions concerning my father and mother;\nwhat my grandparents died of; and whether any of my family were\nstrumous. He struck me as being very odd.\n\nMy school friends were attentive, but I only admitted Helen Perkins to\nsee me. Her liking for me opened my heart still more toward her. She\nwas my first intimate friend--and my last. Though younger than I, she\nwas more experienced, and had already passed through scenes I knew\nnothing of, which had sobered her judgment, and given her feelings a\npractical tinge. She was noted for having the highest spirits of any\ngirl in school--another result of her experiences. She never allowed\nthem to appear fluctuating; she was, therefore, an aid to me, whose\nmoods varied.\n\nAfter my illness came a sense of change. I had lost that careless\nsecurity in my strength which I had always possessed, and was troubled\nwith vague doubts, that made me feel I needed help from without.\n\nI did not see Charles while I was ill, for he was absent most of the\ntime. I knew when he was at home by the silence which pervaded the\npremises. When he was not there, Alice spread the children in all\ndirections, and the servants gave tongue.\n\nHe was not at home the day I went downstairs, and I missed him,\ncontinually asking myself, \"Why do I?\" As I sat with Alice in the\ngarden-room, I said, \"Alice.\" She looked up from her sewing. \"I am\nthinking of Charles.\"\n\n\"Yes. He will be glad to see you again.\"\n\n\"Is he really related to me?\"\n\n\"He told you so, did he not? And his name certainly is Morgeson.\"\n\n\"But we are wholly unlike, are we not?\"\n\n\"Wholly; but why do you ask?\"\n\n\"He influences me so strongly.\"\n\n\"Influences you?\" she echoed.\n\n\"Yes\"; and, with an effort, \"I believe I influence him.\"\n\n\"You are very handsome,\" she said, with a little sharpness. \"So are\nflowers,\" I said to myself.\n\n\"It is not that, Alice,\" I answered peevishly; \"you know better.\"\n\n\"You are peculiar, then; it may be he likes you for being so. He is\nodd, you know; but his oddity never troubles me.\" And she resumed her\nsewing with a placid face.\n\n\"Veronica is odd, also,\" was my thought; \"but oddity there runs in\na different direction.\" Her image appeared to me, pale, delicate,\nunyielding. I seemed to wash like a weed at her base.\n\n\"You should see my sister, Alice.\"\n\n\"Charles spoke of her; he says she plays beautifully. If you feel\nstrong next week, we will go to Boston, and make our winter purchases.\nBy the way, I hope you are not nervous. To go back to Charles, I\nhave noticed how little you say to him. You know he never talks. The\ninfluence you speak of--it does not make you dislike him?\"\n\n\"No; I meant to say--my choice of words must be poor--that it was\npossible I might be thinking too much of him; he is your husband,\nyou know, though I do not think he is particularly interesting, or\npleasing.\"\n\nShe laughed, as if highly amused, and said: \"Well, about our dresses.\nYou need a ball dress, so do I; for we shall have balls this winter,\nand if the children are well, we will go. I think, too, that you had\nbetter get a gray cloth pelisse, with a fur trimming. We dress so much\nat church.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" I said. \"And how will a gray hat with feathers look? I must\nfirst write father, and ask for more money.\"\n\n\"Of course; but he allows you all you want.\"\n\n\"He is not so very rich; we do not live as handsomely as you do.\"\n\nIt was tea-time when we had finished our confab, and Alice sent me to\nbed soon after. I was comfortably drowsy when I heard Charles driving\ninto the stable. \"There he is,\" I thought, with a light heart, for I\nfelt better since I had spoken to Alice of him. Her matter-of-fact air\nhad blown away the cobwebs that had gathered across my fancy.\n\nI saw him at the breakfast-table the next morning. He was noting\nsomething in his memorandum book, which excused him from offering me\nhis hand; but he spoke kindly, said he was glad to see me, hoped I was\nwell, and could find a breakfast that I liked.\n\n\"For some reason or other, I do not eat so much as I did in Surrey.\"\n\nAlice laughed, and I blushed.\n\n\"What do you think, Charles?\" she said, \"Cassandra seems worried by\nthe influence, as she calls it, you have upon each other.\"\n\n\"Does she?\"\n\nHe raised his strange, intense eyes to mine; a blinding, intelligent\nlight flowed from them which I could not defy, nor resist, a light\nwhich filled my veins with a torrent of fire.\n\n\"You think Cassandra is not like you,\" he continued with a curious\nintonation.\n\n\"I told her that your oddities never troubled me.\"\n\n\"That is right.\"\n\n\"To-day,\" I muttered, \"Alice, I shall go back to school.\"\n\n\"You must ride,\" she answered.\n\n\"Jesse will drive you up,\" said Charles, rising. Alice called him\nback, to tell him her plan of the Boston visit.\n\n\"Certainly; go by all means,\" he said, and went on his way.\n\nI made my application to father, telling him I had nothing to wear. He\nanswered with haste, begging me to clothe myself at once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n\nIt was November when we returned from Boston. One morning when the\nfrost sparkled on the dead leaves, which still dropped on the walks,\nHelen Perkins and I were taking a stroll down Silver Street, behind\nthe Academy, when we saw Dr. White coming down the street in his\nsulky, rocking from side to side like a cradle. He stopped when he\ncame up to us.\n\n\"Do ye sit up late of evenings, Miss Morgeson?\"\n\n\"No, Doctor; only once a week or so.\"\n\n\"You are a case.\" And he meditatively pulled his shaggy whiskers\nwith a loose buckskin glove. \"There's a ripple coming under your eyes\nalready; what did I tell you? Let me see, did you say you were like\nfather or mother?\"\n\n\"I look like my father. By the way, Doctor, I am studying my\ntemperament. You will make an infidel of me by your inquiries.\"\n\nHelen laughed, and staring at him, called him a bear, and told him he\nought to live in a hospital, where he would have plenty of sick women\nto tease.\n\n\"I should find few like you there.\"\n\nHe chirruped to his horse, but checked it again, put out his head and\ncalled, \"Keep your feet warm, wont you? And read Shakespeare.\"\n\nHelen said that Dr. White had been crossed in love, and long after had\nmarried a deformed woman--for science's sake, perhaps. His talent was\nwell known out of Rosville; but he was unambitious and eccentric.\n\n\"He is interested in you, Cass, that I see. Are you quite well? What\nabout the change you spoke of?\"\n\n\"Dr. White has theories; he has attached one to me. Nature has\nadjusted us nicely, he thinks, with fine strings; if we laugh too\nmuch, or cry too long, a knot slips somewhere, which 'all the king's\nmen' can't take up again. Perhaps he judges women by his deformed\nwife. Men do judge that way, I suppose, and then pride themselves\non their experience, commencing their speeches about us, with 'you\nwomen.' I'll answer your question, though,--there's a blight creeping\nover me, or a mildew.\"\n\n\"Is there a worm i' the bud?\"\n\n\"There may be one at the root; my top is green and flourishing, isn't\nit?\"\n\n\"You expect to be in a state of beatitude always. What is a mote of\ndust in another's eye, in yours is a cataract. You are mad at your\nblindness, and fight the air because you can't see.\"\n\n\"I feel that I see very little, especially when I understand the\nclearness of your vision. Your good sense is monstrous.\"\n\n\"It will come right somehow, with you; when twenty years are wasted,\nmaybe,\" she answered sadly. \"There's the first bell! I haven't a word\nyet of my rhetoric lesson,\" opening her book and chanting, \"'Man,\nthou pendulum betwixt a smile and tear.' Are you going to Professor\nSimpson's class?\" shutting it again. \"I know the new dance\"; and\nshe began to execute it on the walk. The door of a house opposite\nus opened, and a tall youth came out, hat in hand. Without evincing\nsurprise, he advanced toward Helen, gravely dancing the same step;\nthey finished the figure with unmoved countenances. \"Come now,\" I\nsaid, taking her arm. He then made a series of bows to us, retreating\nto the house, with his face toward us, till he reached the door and\nclosed it. He was tall and stout, with red hair, and piercing black\neyes, and looked about twenty-three. \"Who can that be, Helen?\"\n\n\"A stranger; probably some young man come to Dr. Price, or a law\nstudent. He is new here, at all events. His is not an obscure face; if\nit had been seen, we should have known it.\"\n\n\"We shall meet him, then.\"\n\nAnd we did, the very next day, which was Wednesday, in the hall, where\nwe went to hear the boys declaim. I saw him, sitting by himself in\na chair, instead of being with the classes. He was in a brown study,\nunaware that he was observed; both hands were in his pockets, and his\nlegs were stretched out till his pantaloons had receded up his boots,\nwhose soles he knocked together, oblivious of the noise they made. In\nspite of his red hair, I thought him handsome, with his Roman nose and\nfirm, clefted chin. Helen and I were opposite him at the lower part\nof the hall, but he did not see us, till the first boy mounted the\nplatform, and began to spout one of Cicero's orations; then he looked\nup, and a smile spread over his face. He withdrew his hands from his\npockets, updrew his legs, and surveyed the long row of girls opposite,\nbeginning at the head of the hall. As his eyes reached us, a flash of\nrecognition shot across; he raised his hand as if to salute us, and\nI noticed that it was remarkably handsome, small and white, and\nornamented with an old-fashioned ring. It was our habit, after the\nexercises were over, to gather round Dr. Price, to exchange a few\nwords with him. And this occasion was no exception, for Dr. Price,\nwith his double spectacles, and his silk handkerchief in his hand,\nwas answering our questions, when feeling a touch, he stopped, turned\nhastily, and saw the stranger.\n\n\"Will you be so good as to introduce me to the two young ladies near\nyou? We have met before, but I do not know their names.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the Doctor, taking off his spectacles and wiping them\nleisurely; then raising his voice, said, \"Miss Cassandra Morgeson and\nMiss Helen Perkins, Mr. Ben Somers, of Belem, requests me to present\nhim to you. I add the information that he is, although a senior,\nsuspended from Harvard College, for participating in a disgraceful\nfight. It is at your option to notice him.\"\n\n\"If he would be kind enough,\" said Mr. Somers, moving toward us, \"to\nsay that I won it.\"\n\n\"With such hands?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, Somers,\" interposed the Doctor, \"have you much knowledge of the\nBellevue Pickersgills' pedigree?\"\n\n\"Certainly; my grandpa, Desmond Pickersgill, although he came to this\ncountry as a cabin boy, was brother to an English earl. This is our\ncoat of arms,\" showing the ring he wore.\n\n\"That is a great fact,\" answered the Doctor.\n\n\"This lad,\" addressing me, \"belongs to the family I spoke of to you, a\nmember of which married one of your name.\"\n\n\"Is it possible? I never heard much of my father's family.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Doctor dryly; \"Somers has no coat of arms. I expected,\nwhen I asked you, to hear that the Pickergills' history was at your\nfingers' ends.\"\n\n\"Only above the second joint of the third finger of my left hand.\"\n\nI thought Dr. Price was embarrassing.\n\n\"Is your family from Troy?\" Mr. Somers asked me, in a low tone.\n\n\"Do you dislike my name? Is that of Veronica a better one? It is my\nsister's, and we were named by our great-grandfather, who married a\nSomers, a hundred years ago.\"\n\nMiss Black, my Barmouth teacher, came into my mind, for I had said the\nsame thing to her in my first interview; but I was recalled from my\nwandering by Mr. Somers asking, \"Are you looking for your sister? Far\nbe it from me to disparage any act of your great-grandfather's, but\nI prefer the name of Veronica, and fancy that the person to whom\nthe name belongs has a narrow face, with eyes near together, and a\nquantity of light hair, which falls straight; that she has long hands;\nis fond of Gothic architecture, and has a will of her own.\"\n\n\"But never dances,\" said Helen.\n\nThere was a whist party at somebody's house every Wednesday evening.\nAlice had selected the present for one, and had invited more than the\nusual number. I asked Mr. Somers to come.\n\n\"Dress coat?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Oh, no.\"\n\n\"Is Rosville highly starched?\"\n\n\"Oh, no.\"\n\n\"I'll be sure to go into society, then, as long as I can go limp.\"\n\nHe bowed, and, retiring with Dr. Price, walked through the green with\nhim, perusing the ground.\n\nI wore a dark blue silk for the party, with a cinnamon-colored satin\nstripe through it; a dress that Alice supervised. She fastened a pair\nof pearl ear-rings in my ears, and told me that I never looked better.\nIt was the first time since grandfather's death that I had worn any\ndress except a black one. My short sleeves were purled velvet, and\na lace tucker was drawn with a blue ribbon across the corsage. As\nI adjusted my dress, a triumphant sense of beauty possessed me;\nCleopatra could not have been more convinced of her charms than I was\nof mine. \"It is a pleasant thing,\" I thought, \"that a woman's mind may\ncome and go by the gate Beautiful.\"\n\nI went down before Alice, who stayed with the children till she heard\nthe first ring at the door.\n\n\"Where is Charles?\" I asked, after we had greeted the Bancrofts.\n\n\"He will come in time to play, for he likes whist; do you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nWe did not speak again, but I noticed how gay and agreeable she was\nthrough the evening.\n\nBen Somers came early, suffering from a fit of nonchalance, to the\ndisgust of several young men, standard beaux, who regarded him with an\nimpertinence which delighted him.\n\n\"Here comes,\" he said, \"'a daughter of the gods, divinely tall, and\nmost divinely fair.'\" Meaning me, which deepened their disgust.\n\n\"Come to the piano,\" I begged. Helen was there, but his eyes did not\nrest upon her, but upon Charles, whom I saw for the first time that\nevening. I introduced them.\n\n\"Cassandra,\" said Charles, \"let us make up a game in the East Room.\nMiss Helen, will you join? Mr. Somers, will you take a hand?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Miss Morgeson, will you be my partner?\"\n\n\"Will you play with me then, Miss Helen?\" asked Charles.\n\n\"If you desire it,\" she answered, rather ungraciously.\n\nWe took our seats in the East Room, which opened from the parlor, at a\nlittle table by the chimney. The astral lamp from the center table in\nthe parlor shone into our room, intercepting any view toward us. I sat\nby the window, the curtain of which was drawn apart, and the shutters\nunclosed. A few yellow leaves stuck against the panes, unstirred by\nthe melancholy wind, which sighed through the crevices. Charles was at\nmy right hand, by the mantel; the light from a candelabra illuminated\nhim and Mr. Somers, while Helen and I were in shadow. Mr. Somers dealt\nthe cards, and we began the game.\n\n\"We shall beat you,\" he said to Charles.\n\n\"Not unless Cassandra has improved,\" he replied.\n\nI promised to do my best, but soon grew weary, and we were beaten. To\nmy surprise Mr. Somers was vexed. His imperturbable manner vanished;\nhe sat erect, his eyes sparkled, and he told me I must play better. We\nbegan another game, which he was confident of winning. I kept my eyes\non the cards, and there was silence till Mr. Somers exclaimed, \"Don't\ntrump now, Mr. Morgeson.\"\n\nI watched the table for his card to fall, but as it did not, looked\nat him for the reason. He had forgotten us, and was lost in\ncontemplation, with his eyes fixed upon me. The recognition of\nsome impulse had mastered him. I must prevent Helen and Mr. Somers\nperceiving this! I shuffled the cards noisily, rustled my dress,\nlooked right and left for my handkerchief to break the spell.\n\n\"How the wind moans!\" said Helen. I understood her tone; she\nunderstood him, as I did.\n\n\"I _like_ Rosville, Miss Perkins,\" cried Mr. Somers.\n\n\"Do you?\" said Charles, clicking down his card, as though his turn had\njust come. \"I must trump this in spite of you.\"\n\n\"I am tired of playing,\" I said.\n\n\"We are beaten, Miss Perkins,\" said Mr. Somers, rising. \"Bring it\nhere,\" to a servant going by with a tray and glasses. He drank\na goblet of wine, before he offered us any. \"Now give us music!\"\noffering his arm to Helen, and taking her away. Charles and I remained\nat the table. \"By the way,\" he said abruptly, \"I have forgotten to\ngive you a letter from your father--here it is.\" I stretched my hand\nacross the table, he retained it. I rose from my chair and stood\nbeside him.\n\n\"Cassandra,\" he said at last, growing ashy pale, \"is there any other\nworld than this we are in now?\"\n\nI raised my eyes, and saw my own pale face in the glass over the\nmantel above his head.\n\n\"What do you see?\" he asked, starting up.\n\nI pointed to the glass.\n\n\"I begin to think,\" I said, \"there is another world, one peopled\nwith creatures like those we see there. What are they--base, false,\ncowardly?\"\n\n\"Cowardly,\" he muttered, \"will you make me crush you? Can we lie to\neach other? Look!\"\n\nHe turned me from the glass.\n\nAt that moment Helen struck a crashing blow on the piano keys.\n\n\"Charles, give me--give me the letter.\"\n\nHe looked vaguely round the floor, it was crumpled in his hand. A side\ndoor shut, and I stood alone. Pinching my cheeks and wiping my lips to\nforce the color back, I returned to the parlor. Mr. Somers came to me\nwith a glass of wine. It was full, and some spilled on my dress; he\nmade no offer to wipe it off. After that, he devoted himself to Alice;\ntalked lightly with her, observing her closely. I made the tour of the\nparty, overlooked the whist players, chatted with the talkers, finally\ntaking a seat, where Helen joined me.\n\n\"Now I am going,\" she said.\n\n\"Why don't they all go?\"\n\n\"Look at Mr. Somers playing the agreeable to Mrs. Morgeson. What kind\nof a woman is she, Cass?\"\n\n\"Go and learn for yourself.\"\n\n\"I fear I have not the gift for divining people that you have.\"\n\n\"Do you hear the wind moan now, Helen?\"\n\nShe turned crimson, and said: \"Let us go to the window; I think it\nrains.\"\n\nWe stood within the curtains, and listened to its pattering on the\nfloor of the piazza, and trickling down the glass like tears.\n\n\"Helen, if one could weep as quietly as this rain falls, and keep the\nface as unwrinkled as the glass, it would be pretty to weep.\"\n\n\"Is it hard for you to cry?\"\n\n\"I can't remember; it is so long since.\"\n\nMy ear caught the sound of a step on the piazza.\n\n\"Who is that?\" she asked.\n\n\"It is a man.\"\n\n\"Morgeson?\"\n\n\"Morgeson.\"\n\n\"Cassandra?\"\n\n\"Cassandra.\"\n\n\"I can cry,\" and Helen covered her face.\n\n\"Cry away, then. Give me a fierce shower of tears, with thunder and\nlightning between, if you like. Don't sop, and soak, and drizzle.\"\n\nThe step came close to the window; it was not in harmony with the rain\nand darkness, but with the hot beating of my heart.\n\n\"We are breaking up,\" called Mr. Somers. \"Mr. Bancroft's carriage is\nready, I am bid to say. It is inky outside.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Helen, \"I am quite ready.\"\n\n\"There are a dozen chaises in the yard; Mr. Morgeson is there, and\nlanterns. He is at home among horses, I believe.\"\n\n\"Do you like horses?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not in the least.\"\n\nSomebody called Helen.\n\n\"Good-night, Cass.\"\n\n\"Good-night; keep out of the rain.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Miss Morgeson,\" said Mr. Somers, when she had gone.\n\"Good-night and good-morning. My acquaintance with you has begun; it\nwill never end. You thought me a boy; I am just your age.\"\n\n\"'Never,' is a long word, Boy Somers.\"\n\n\"It is.\"\n\nIt rained all night; I wearied of its monotonous fall; if I slept it\nturned into a voice which was pent up in a letter which I could not\nopen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n\nAlice was unusually gay the next morning. She praised Mr. Somers, and\ncould not imagine what had been the cause of his being expelled from\nthe college.\n\n\"Don't you like him, Cassandra? His family are unexceptionable.\"\n\n\"So is he, I believe, except in his fists. But how did you learn that\nhis family were unexceptionable?\"\n\n\"Charles inquired in Boston, and heard that his mother was one of the\ngreatest heiresses in Belem.\"\n\n\"Did you enjoy last night, Alice?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am fond of whist parties. You noticed that Charles has not a\nremarkable talent that way. Did he speak to Mr. Somers at all, while\nyou played? I was too busy to come in. By the by, I must go now, and\nsee if the parlor is in order.\"\n\nI followed her with my bonnet in hand, for it was school time.\nShe looked about, then went up to the mantel, and taking out the\ncandle-ends from the candelabra, looked in the glass, and said, \"I am\na fright this morning.\"\n\n\"Am I?\" I asked over her shoulder, for I was nearly a head taller.\n\n\"No; you are too young to look jaded in the morning. Your eyes are as\nclear as a child's; and how blue they are.\"\n\n\"Mild and babyish-like, are they not? almost green with innocence. But\nCharles has devilish eyes, don't you think so?\"\n\nShe turned with her mouth open in astonishment, and her hand full of\ncandle-ends. \"Cassandra Morgeson, are you mad?\"\n\n\"Good-by,\" Alice.\n\nI only saw Mr. Somers at prayers during the following fortnight. But\nin that short time he made many acquaintances. Helen told me that he\nhad decided to study law with Judge Ryder, and that he had asked her\nhow long I expected to stay in Rosville. Nothing eccentric had been\ndiscovered in his behavior; but she was convinced that he would\nastonish us before long. The first Wednesday after our party, I was\nabsent from the elocutionary exercise; but the second came round, and\nI took my place as usual beside Helen.\n\n\"This will be Mr. Somers's first and last appearance on our stage,\"\nshe whispered; \"some whim prompts him to come to-day.\"\n\nHe delighted Dr. Price by translating from the Agamemnon of \u00c3\u0086schylus.\n\n\"Re-enter Clytemnestra.\"\n\n\"_Men! Citizens! ye Elders of Argos present here._\"\n\n\"Who was Agamemnon?\" I whispered.\n\n\"He gave Cassandra her last ride.\"\n\n\"Did he upset her?\"\n\n\"Study Greek and you will know,\" she replied, frowning at him as he\nstepped from the platform.\n\nWe went to walk in Silver Street after school, and he joined us.\n\n\"Do you read Greek?\" he asked her.\n\n\"My father is a Greek Professor, and he made me study it when I was a\nlittle girl.\"\n\n\"The name of Cassandra inspired me to rub up my knowledge of the\ntragedies.\"\n\nHelen and he had a Homeric talk, while I silently walked by them,\nthinking that Cassandra would have suited Veronica, and that no name\nsuited me. From some reason I did not discover, Helen began to loiter,\npretending that she wanted to have a look at the clouds. But when I\nlooked back her head was bent to the ground. Mr. Somers offered to\ncarry my books.\n\n\"Carry Helen's; she is smaller than I am.\"\n\n\"Confound Helen!\"\n\n\"And the books, too, if you like. Helen,\" I called, \"why do you\nloiter? It is time for dinner. We must go home.\"\n\n\"I am quite ready for my dinner,\" she replied. \"Wont you come to our\nhouse this afternoon and take tea with me?\"\n\n\"Oh, Miss Perkins, do invite me also,\" he begged. \"I want to bring\nTennyson to you.\"\n\n\"Is he related to Agamemnon?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'll ask Mrs. Bancroft if I may invite you,\" said Helen, \"if you are\nsure that you would like a stupid, family tea.\"\n\n\"I am positive that I should. Tennyson, though an eminent Grecian, is\nnot related to the person you spoke of.\"\n\nWe parted at the foot of Silver Street, with the expectation of\nmeeting before night. Helen sent me word not to fail, as she had sent\nfor Mr. Somers, and that Mrs. Bancroft was already preparing tea.\nAlice drove down there with me, to call on Mrs. Bancroft. The two\nladies compared children, and by the time Alice was ready to go, Mr.\nSomers arrived. She staid a few moments more to chat with him, and\nwhen she went at last, told me Charles would come for me on his way\nfrom the mills.\n\nMy eyes wandered in the direction of Mr. Somers. His said: \"No; go\nhome with _me_.\"\n\n\"Very well, Alice, whatever is convenient,\" I answered quietly.\n\nMrs. Bancroft was a motherly woman, and Mr. Bancroft was a fatherly\nman. Five children sat round the tea-table, distinguished by the\nBancroft nose. Helen and I were seated each side of Mr. Somers. The\ntable reminded me of our table at Surrey, it was so covered with vast\nviands; but the dishes were alike, and handsome. I wondered whether\nmother had bought the new china in Boston, and, buttering my second\nhot biscuit, I thought of Veronica; then, of the sea. How did it look?\nHark! Its voice was in my ear! Could I climb the housetop? Might I not\nsee the mist which hung over our low-lying sea by Surrey?\n\n\"Will you take quince or apple jelly, Miss Morgeson?\" asked Mrs.\nBancroft.\n\n\"Apple, if you please.\"\n\n\"Do you write that sister of yours often?\" asked Mr. Somers, as he\npassed me the apple jelly.\n\n\"I never write her.\"\n\n\"Will you tell me something of Surrey?\"\n\n\"Mr. Somers, shall I give you a cup-custard?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, mam.\"\n\n\"Surrey is lonely, evangelical, primitive.\"\n\n\"Belem is dreary too; most of it goes to Boston, or to India.\"\n\n\"Does it smell of sandal wood? And has everybody tea-caddies? _Vide_\nIndian stories.\"\n\n\"We have a crate of queer things from Calcutta.\"\n\n\"Are you going to study law with Judge Ryder?\" Mr. Bancroft inquired.\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\nThen Helen pushed back her chair; and Mrs. Bancroft stood in her place\nlong enough for us to reach the parlor door.\n\n\"And I must go to the office,\" Mr. Bancroft said, so we had the parlor\nto ourselves; but Mr. Somers did not read from Tennyson--for he had\nforgotten to bring the book.\n\n\"Now for a compact,\" he said. \"I must be called Ben Somers by you; and\nmay I call you Cassandra, and Helen?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" we answered.\n\n\"Let us be confidential.\"\n\nAnd we were. I was drawn into speaking of my life at home; my remarks,\nmade without premeditation, proved that I possessed ideas and feelings\nhitherto unknown. I felt no shyness before him, and, although I saw\nhis interest in me, no agitation. Helen was also moved to tell us\nthat she was engaged. She rolled up her sleeve to show us a bracelet,\nprinted in ink on her arm, with the initials, \"L.N.\" Those of her\ncousin, she said; he was a sailor, and some time, she supposed, they\nwould marry.\n\n\"How could you consent to have your arm so defaced?\" I asked.\n\nHer eyes flashed as she replied that she had not looked upon the mark\nin that light before.\n\n\"We may all be tattooed,\" said Mr. Somers.\n\n\"I am,\" I thought.\n\nHe told us in his turn that he should be rich. \"There are five of us.\nMy mother's fortune cuts up rather; but it wont be divided till the\nyoungest is twenty-one. I assure you we are impatient.\"\n\n\"Some one of your family happened to marry a Morgeson,\" I here\nremarked.\n\n\"I wrote father about that; he must know the circumstance, though he\nnever has a chance to expatiate on _his_ side of the house. Poor man!\nhe has the gout, and passes his time in experiments with temperature\nand diet. Will you ever visit Belem? I shall certainly go to Surrey.\"\n\nMrs. Bancroft interrupted us, and soon after Mr. Bancroft arrived,\nredolent of smoke. Ten o'clock came, and nobody for me. At half-past\nten I put on my shawl to walk home, when Charles drove up to the gate.\n\n\"Say,\" said Ben Somers, in a low voice, \"that you will walk with me.\"\n\n\"I am not too late, Cassandra?\" called Charles, coming up the steps,\nbowing to all. \"I am glad you are ready; Nell is impatient.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" asked Mrs. Bancroft, \"how dare you trust to the mercy of\nsuch vicious beasts as Mr. Morgeson loves to drive?\"\n\n\"Come,\" he said, touching my arm.\n\n\"Wont you walk?\" said Mr. Somers aloud.\n\n\"Walk?\" echoed Charles. \"No.\"\n\n\"I followed him. Nell had already bitten off a paling; and as he\nuntied her he boxed her ears. She did not jump, for she knew the hand\nthat struck her. We rushed swiftly away through the long shadows of\nthe moonlight.\n\n\"Charles, what did Ben Somers do at Harvard?\"\n\n\"He was in a night-fight, and he sometimes got drunk; it is a family\nhabit.\"\n\n\"Pray, why did you inquire about him?\"\n\n\"From the interest I feel in him.\"\n\n\"You like him, then?\"\n\n\"I detest him; do you too?\"\n\n\"I like him.\"\n\nHe bent down and looked into my face.\n\n\"You are telling me a lie.\"\n\nI made no reply.\n\n\"I should beg your pardon, but I will not. I am going away to-morrow.\nGive me your hand, and say farewell.\"\n\n\"Farewell then. Is Alice up? I see a light moving in her chamber.\"\n\n\"If you do, she is not waiting for me.\"\n\n\"I have been making coffee for you,\" she said, as soon as we entered,\n\"in my French biggin. I have packed your valise too, Charles, and have\nordered your breakfast. Cassy, we will breakfast after he has gone.\"\n\n\"I have to sit up to write, Alice. See that the horses are exercised.\nAsk Parker to drive them. The men will be here to-morrow to enlarge\nthe conservatory.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I shall get a better stock while I am away.\"\n\nI sipped my coffee; Alice yawned fearfully, with her hand on the\ncoffee-pot, ready to pour again. \"Why, Charles,\" she exclaimed, \"there\nis no cream in your coffee.\"\n\n\"No, there isn't,\" looking into his cup; \"nor sugar.\"\n\nShe threw a lump at him, which he caught, laughing one of his abrupt\nlaughs.\n\n\"How extraordinarily affectionate,\" I thought, but somehow it pleased\nme.\n\n\"Why do you tempt me, Alice?\" I said. \"Doctor White says I must not\ndrink coffee.\"\n\n\"Tempted!\" Charles exclaimed. \"Cassandra is never tempted. What she\ndoes, she does because she will. Don't worry yourself, Alice, about\nher.\"\n\n\"Because I will,\" I repeated.\n\nA nervous foreboding possessed me, the moment I entered my room. Was\nit the coffee? Twice in the night I lighted my candle, looked at the\nlittle French clock on the mantel, and under the bed. At last I fell\nasleep, but starting violently from its oblivious dark, to become\naware that the darkness of the room was sentient. A breath passed over\nmy face; but I caught no sound, though I held my breath to listen for\none. I moved my hands before me then, but they came in contact with\nnothing. My forebodings passed away, and I slept till Alice sent for\nme. I sat up in bed philosophizing, and examining the position of\nthe chairs, the tops of the tables and the door. No change had taken\nplace. But my eyes happened to fall on my handkerchief, which had\ndropped by the bedside. I picked it up; there was a dusty footprint\nupon it. The bell rang, and, throwing it under the bed, I dressed and\nran down. Alice was taking breakfast, tired of waiting. She said the\nbaby had cried till after midnight, and that Charles never came to bed\nat all.\n\n\"Do eat this hot toast; it has just come in.\"\n\n\"I shall stay at home to-day, Alice, I feel chilly; is it cold?\"\n\n\"You must have a fire in your room.\"\n\n\"Let me have one to day; I should like to sit there.\"\n\nShe gave orders for the fire, and went herself to see that it burned.\nSoon I was sitting before it, my feet on a stool, and a poker in my\nhand with which I smashed the smoky lumps of coal which smoldered in\nthe grate.\n\nI stayed there all day, looking out of the window when I heard the\nhorses tramp in the stable or a step on the piazza. It was a dull\nNovember day; the atmosphere was glutinous with a pale mist, which\nmade the leaves stick together in bunches, helplessly cumbering the\nground. The boughs dropped silent tears over them, under the gray,\npitiless sky. I read Byron, which was the only book in the house,\nI believe; for neither Charles nor Alice read anything except the\nnewspapers. I looked over my small stores also, and my papers, which\nconsisted of father's letters. As I was sorting them the thought\nstruck me of writing to Veronica, and I arranged my portfolio, pulled\nthe table nearer the fire, and began, \"Dear Veronica.\" After writing\nthis a few times I gave it up, cut off the \"Dear Veronicas,\" and made\nlamplighters of the paper.\n\nBen Somers called at noon, to inquire the reason of my absence from\nschool, and left a book for me. It was the poems he had spoken of.\nI lighted on \"Fatima,\" read it and copied it. In the afternoon Alice\ncame up with the baby.\n\n\"Let me braid your hair,\" she said, \"in a different fashion.\"\n\nI assented; the baby was bestowed on a rug, and a chair was put before\nthe glass, that I might witness the operation.\n\n\"What magnificent hair!\" she said, as she unrolled it. \"It is a yard\nlong.\"\n\n\"It is a regular mane, isn't it?\"\n\nShe began combing it; the baby crawled under the bed, and coming out\nwith the handkerchief in its hand, crept up to her, trying to make her\ntake it. She had combed my hair over my face, but I saw it.\n\n\"Do I hurt you, Cass?\"\n\n\"No, do I ever hurt you, Alice?\" And I divided the long bands over my\neyes, and looked up at her.\n\n\"Were any of your family ever cracked? I have long suspected you of a\ndisposition that way.\"\n\n\"The child is choking itself with that handkerchief.\"\n\nShe took it, and, tossing it on the bed, gave Byron to the child to\nplay with, and went on with the hair-dressing.\n\n\"There, now,\" she said, \"is not this a masterpiece of barber's craft?\nLook at the back of your head, and then come down.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will, for I feel better.\"\n\nWhen I returned to my room again it was like meeting a confidential\nfriend.\n\nA few days after, father came to Rosville. I invited Ben Somers and\nHelen to spend with us the only evening he stayed. After they were\ngone, we sat in my room and talked over many matters. His spirits were\nnot as buoyant as usual, and I felt an undefinable anxiety which I did\nnot mention. When he said that mother was more abstracted than\never, he sighed. I asked him how many years he thought I must waste;\neighteen had already gone for nothing.\n\n\"You must go in the way ordained, waste or no waste. I have tried to\nmake your life differ from mine at the same age, for you are like me,\nand I wanted to see the result.\"\n\n\"We shall see.\"\n\n\"Veronica has been let alone--is master of herself, except when in a\nrage. She is an extraordinary girl; independent of kith and kin, and\neverything else. I assure you, Miss Cassy, she is very good.\"\n\n\"Does she ever ask for me?\"\n\n\"I never heard her mention your name but once. She asked one day what\nyour teachers were. You do not love each other, I suppose. What hatred\nthere is between near relations! Bitter, bitter,\" he said calmly, as\nif he thought of some object incapable of the hatred he spoke of.\n\n\"That's Grandfather John Morgeson you think of. I do not hate\nVeronica. I think I love her; at least she interests me.\"\n\n\"The same creeping in the blood of us all, Cassy. I did not like my\nfather; but thank God I behaved decently toward him. It must be late.\"\n\nAs he kissed me, and we stood face to face, I recognized my likeness\nto him. \"He has had experiences that I shall never know,\" I thought.\n\"Why should I tell him mine?\" But an overpowering impulse seized me\nto speak to him of Charles. \"Father,\" and I put my hands on his\nshoulders. He set his candle back on the table.\n\n\"You look hungry-eyed, eager. What is it? Are you well?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You are faded a little. Your face has lost its firmness.\"\n\nMy impulse died a sudden death. I buried it with a swallow.\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"You are all alike. Let me tell you something; don't get sick. If you\nare, hide it as much as possible. Men do not like sick women.\"\n\n\"I'll end this fading business as soon as possible. It _is_ late.\nGood-night, dad.\"\n\nI examined my face as soon as he closed the door. There _was_ a\nchange. Not the change from health to disease, but an expression\nlurking there--a reflection of some unrevealed secret.\n\nThe next morning was passed with Alice and the children. He was\npleased with her prettiness and sprightliness, and his gentle manner\nand disposition pleased her. She asked him to let me spend another\nyear in Rosville; but he said that I must return to Surrey, and that\nhe never would allow me to leave home again.\n\n\"She will marry.\"\n\n\"Not early.\"\n\n\"Never, I believe,\" I said.\n\n\"It will be as well.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied; \"if you leave her a fortune, or teach her some\ntrade, that will give her some importance in the world.\"\n\nHer wisdom astonished me.\n\nHe was sorry, he said, that Morgeson was not at home. When he\nmentioned him I looked out of the window, and saw Ben Somers coming\ninto the yard. As he entered, Alice gave him a meaning look, which was\nnot lost upon me, and which induced him to observe Ben closely.\n\n\"The train is nearly due, Mr. Morgeson; shall I walk to the station\nwith you?\"\n\n\"Certainly; come, Cassy.\"\n\nOn the way he touched me, making a sign toward Ben. I shook my head,\nwhich appeared satisfactory. The rest of the time was consumed in the\ndiscussion of the relationship, which ended in an invitation, as I\nexpected, to Surrey.\n\n\"The governor is not worried, is he?\" asked Ben, on our way back.\n\n\"No more than I am.\"\n\n\"What a pity Morgeson was not at home!\"\n\n\"Why a pity?\"\n\n\"I should like to see them together, they are such antipodal men. Does\nyour father know him well?\"\n\n\"Does any one know him well?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know him. I do not like him. He is a savage, living by his\ninstincts, with one element of civilization--he loves Beauty--beauty\nlike yours.\" He turned pale when he said this, but went on. \"He has\nnever seen a woman like you; who has? Forgive me, but I watch you\nboth.\"\n\n\"I have perceived it.\"\n\n\"I suppose so, and it makes you more willful.\"\n\n\"You said you were but a boy.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I have had one or two manly wickednesses. I have done with\nthem, I hope.\"\n\n\"So that you have leisure to pry into those of others.\"\n\n\"You do not forgive me.\"\n\n\"I like you; but what can I do?\"\n\n\"Keep up your sophistry to the last.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n\nAlice and I were preparing for the first ball, when Charles came home,\nhaving been absent several weeks. The conservatory was finished, and\nlooked well, jutting from the garden-room, which we used often, since\nthe weather had been cold. The flowers and plants it was filled with\nwere more fragrant and beautiful than rare. I never saw him look so\ngenial as when he inspected it with us. Alice was in good-humor, also,\nfor he had brought her a set of jewels.\n\n\"Is it not her birthday,\" he said, when he gave her the jewel case,\n\"or something, that I can give Cassandra this?\" taking a little box\nfrom his pocket.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Alice; \"show it to us.\"\n\n\"Will you have it?\" he asked me.\n\nI held out my hand, and he put on my third finger a diamond ring,\nwhich was like a star.\n\n\"How well it looks on your long hand!\" said Alice.\n\n\"What unsuspected tastes I find I have!\" I answered. \"I am\npassionately fond of rings; this delights me.\"\n\nHis swarthy face flushed with pleasure at my words; but, according to\nhis wont, he said nothing.\n\nA few days after his return, a man came into the yard, leading a\npowerful horse chafing in his halter, which he took to the\nstable. Charles asked me to look at a new purchase he had made in\nPennsylvania. The strange man was lounging about the stalls when we\nwent in, inspecting the horses with a knowing air.\n\n\"I declare, sir,\" said Jesse, \"I am afeared to tackle this ere animal;\nhe's a reglar brute, and no mistake.\"\n\n\"He'll be tame enough; he is but four years old.\"\n\n\"He's never been in a carriage,\" said the man.\n\n\"Lead him out, will you?\"\n\nThe man obeyed. The horse was a fine creature, black, and thick-maned;\nbut the whites of his eyes were not clear; they were streaked with\nred, and he attempted continually to turn his nostrils inside out.\nAltogether, I thought him diabolical.\n\n\"What's the matter with his eyes?\" Charles asked.\n\n\"I think, sir,\" the man replied, \"as how they got inflamed like, in\nthe boat coming from New York. It's nothing perticalar, I believe.\"\n\nAlice declared it was too bad, when she heard there was another horse\nin the stable. She would not look at him, and said she would never\nride with Charles when he drove him.\n\nI had been taking lessons of Professor Simpson, and was ready for\nthe ball. All the girls from the Academy were going in white, except\nHelen, who was to wear pink silk. It was to be a military ball, and\nstrangers were expected. Ben Somers, and our Rosville beaux, were\nof course to be there, all in uniform, except Ben, who preferred the\ndress of a gentleman, he said,--silk stockings, pumps, and a white\ncravat.\n\nWe were dressed by nine o'clock, Alice in black velvet, with a wreath\nof flowers in her black hair--I in a light blue velvet bodice, and\nwhite silk skirt. We were waiting for the ball hack to come for us, as\nthat was the custom, for no one owned a close coach in Rosville, when\nCharles brought in some splendid scarlet flowers which he gave to\nAlice.\n\n\"Where are Cassandra's?\"\n\n\"She does not care for flowers; besides, she would throw them away on\nher first partner.\"\n\nHe put us in the coach, and went back. I was glad he did not come with\nus, and gave myself up to the excitement of my first ball. Alice was\nsurrounded by her acquaintances at once, and I was asked to dance a\nquadrille by Mr. Parker, whose gloves were much too large, and whose\nwhite trowsers were much too long.\n\n\"I kept the flowers you gave me,\" he said in a breathless way.\n\n\"Oh yes, I remember; mustn't we forward now?\"\n\n\"Mr. Morgeson's very fond of flowers.\"\n\n\"So he is. How de do, Miss Ryder.\"\n\nMiss Ryder, my vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis, bowed, looking scornfully at my partner, who\nwas only a clerk, while hers was a law student. I immediately turned\nto Mr. Parker with affable smiles, and went into a kind of dumb-show\nof conversation, which made him warm and uncomfortable. Mrs. Judge\nRyder sailed by on Ben Somers's arm.\n\n\"Put your shoulders down,\" she whispered to her daughter, who had\npoked one very much out of her dress. \"My love,\" she spoke aloud, \"you\nmustn't dance _every_ set.\"\n\n\"No, ma,\" and she passed on, Ben giving a faint cough, for my benefit.\nWe could not find Alice after the dance was over. A brass band\nalternated with the quadrille band, and it played so loudly that we\nhad to talk at the top of our voices to be heard. Mine soon gave out,\nand I begged Mr. Parker to bring Helen, for I had not yet seen her.\nShe was with Dr. White, who had dropped in to see the miserable\nspectacle. The air, he said, shaking his finger at me, was already\nmiasmal; it would be infernal by midnight Christians ought not to be\nthere. \"Go home early, Miss. Your mother never went to a ball, I'll\nwarrant.\"\n\n\"We are wiser than our mothers.\"\n\n\"And wickeder; you will send for me to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Your Valenciennes lace excruciates the Ryders,\" said Helen. \"I was\nstanding near Mrs. Judge Ryder and the girls just now. 'Did you ever\nsee such an upstart?' And, 'What an extravagant dress she has on--it\nis ridiculous,' Josephine Ryder said. When Ben Somers heard this\nattack on you, he told them that your lace was an heirloom. Here he\nis.\" Mr. Parker took her away, and Ben Somers went in pursuit of a\nseat. The quadrille was over, I was engaged for the next, and he had\nnot come back. I saw nothing of him till the country dance before\nsupper. He was at the foot of the long line, opposite a pretty girl\nin blue, looking very solemn and stately. I took off the glove from my\nhand which wore the new diamond, and held it up, expecting him to look\nmy way soon. Its flash caught his eyes, as they roamed up and down,\nand, as I expected, he left his place and came up behind me.\n\n\"Where did you get that ring?\" wiping his face with his handkerchief.\n\n\"Ask Alice.\"\n\n\"You are politic.\"\n\n\"Handsome, isn't it?\"\n\n\"And valuable; it cost as much as the new horse.\"\n\n\"Have you made a memorandum of it?\"\n\n\"Destiny has brilliant spokes in her wheel, hasn't she?\"\n\n\"Is that from the Greek tragedies?\"\n\n\"To your places, gentlemen,\" the floor-manager called, and the band\nstruck up the Fisher's Hornpipe. At supper, I saw Ben Somers, still\nwith the pretty girl in blue; but he came to my chair and asked me if\nI did not think she was a pretty toy for a man to play with.\n\n\"How much wine have you drunk? Enough to do justice to the family\nannals?\"\n\n\"Really, you have been well informed. No, I have _not_ drunk enough\nfor that; but Mrs. Ryder has sent her virgins home with me. I am\nafraid their lamps are upset again. I drink nothing after to-night.\nYou shall not ask again, 'How much?'\"\n\nMy fire was out when I reached home. My head was burning and aching.\nI was too tired to untwist my hair, and I pulled and dragged at my\ndress, which seemed to have a hundred fastenings. Creeping into bed,\nI perceived the odor of flowers, and looking at my table discovered a\nbunch of white roses.\n\n\"Roses are nonsense, and life is nonsense,\" I thought.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, Alice was standing by the bed, with a glass of\nroses in her hand.\n\n\"Charles put these roses here, hey?\"\n\n\"I suppose so; throw them out of the window, and me too; my head is\nsplitting.\"\n\n\"To make amends for not giving you any last night,\" she went on; \"he\nis quite childish.\"\n\n\"Can't you unbraid my hair, it hurts my head so?\"\n\nShe felt my hands. I was in a fever, she said, and ran down for\nCharles. \"Cass is sick, in spite of your white roses.\"\n\n\"The devil take the roses. Can't you get up, Cassandra?\"\n\n\"Not now. Go away, will you?\"\n\nHe left the room abruptly. Alice loosened my hair, bound my head, and\npoured cologne-water over me, lamenting all the while that she had not\nbrought me home; and then went down for some tea, presently returning\nto say that Charles had been for Dr. White, who said he would not\ncome. But he was there shortly afterward. By night I was well again.\n\nDr. Price gave us a lecture on late hours that week, requesting us, if\nwe had any interest in our education, or expected him to have any, to\nabstain from balls.\n\nBen Somers disappeared; no one knew where he had gone. The Ryders were\nin consternation, for he was an intimate of the family, since he\nhad gone into Judge Ryder's office, six weeks before. He returned,\nhowever, with a new overcoat trimmed with fur, the same as that with\nwhich my new cloak was trimmed. A great snowstorm began the day of his\nreturn, and blocked us indoors for several days, and we had permanent\nsleighing afterward.\n\nIn January it was proposed that we should go to the Swan Tavern, ten\nmiles out of Rosville.\n\nI had made good resolutions since the ball, and declined going to the\nsecond, which came off three weeks afterward. The truth was, I did not\nenjoy the first; but I preferred to give my decision a virtuous tinge.\nI also determined to leave the Academy when the spring came, for I\nfelt no longer a schoolgirl. But for Helen, I could not have remained\nas I did. She stayed for pastime now, she confessed, it was so dull at\nhome; her father was wrapped in his studies, and she had a stepmother.\nI resolved again that I would study more, and was translating, in view\nof this resolve, \"Corinne,\" with Miss Prior, and singing sedulously\nwith Mrs. Lane, and had begun a course of reading with Dr. Price.\n\nI refused two invitations to join the sleighing party, and on the\nnight it was to be had prepared to pass the evening in my own room\nwith Oswald and Corinne. Before the fire, with lighted candles, I\nheard a ringing of bells in the yard and a stamping of feet on the\npiazza. Alice sent up for me. I found Ben Somers with her, who begged\nme to take a seat in his sleigh. Helen was there, and Amelia Bancroft.\nAlice applauded me for refusing him; but when he whispered in my ear\nthat he had been to Surrey I changed my mind. She assisted me with\ncheerful alacrity to put on a merino dress, its color was purple;--a\ncolor I hate now, and never wear--and wrapped me warmly. Charles\nappeared before we started. \"Are you really going?\" he asked, in a\ntone of displeasure.\n\n\"She is really going,\" Ben answered for me. \"Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft are\ngoing,\" Helen said. \"Why not drive out with Mrs. Morgeson?\"\n\n\"The night is splendid,\" Ben remarked.\n\n\"Wont you come?\" I asked.\n\n\"If Alice wishes it. Will you go?\" he asked her.\n\n\"Would you?\" she inquired of all, and all replied, \"Yes.\"\n\nWe started in advance. Helen and Amelia were packed on the back seat,\nin a buffalo robe, while Ben and I sat in the shelter of the driver's\nbox, wrapped in another. It was moonlight, and as we passed the\nsleighs of the rest of the party, exchanging greetings, we grew very\nmerry. Ben, voluble and airy, enlivened us by his high spirits.\n\nWe were drinking mulled wine round the long pine dinner-table of the\nSwan, when Charles and Alice arrived. There were about thirty in the\nroom, which was lighted by tallow candles. When he entered, it seemed\nas if the candles suddenly required snuffing, and we ceased to laugh.\nAll spoke to him with respect, but with an inflection of the voice\nwhich denoted that he was not one of us. As he carelessly passed round\nthe table all made a movement as he approached, scraping their chairs\non the bare floor, moving their glass of mulled wine, or altering the\nposition of their arms or legs. An indescribable appreciation of the\nimpression which he made upon others filled my heart. His isolation\nfrom the sympathy of every person there gave me a pain and a pity, and\nfor the first time I felt a pang of tenderness, and a throe of pride\nfor him. But Alice, upon whom he never made any impression, saw\nnothing of this; her gayety soon removed the stiffness and silence he\ncreated. The party grew noisy again, except Ben, who had not broken\nthe silence into which he fell as soon as he saw Charles. The mulled\nwine stood before him untouched. I moved to the corner of the table\nto allow room for the chair which Charles was turning toward me. Ben\nordered more wine, and sent a glass full to him. Taking it from\nthe boy who brought it, I gave it to him. \"Drink,\" I said. My voice\nsounded strangely. Barely tasting it, he set the glass down, and\nleaning his arm on the table, turned his face to me, shielding it with\nhis hand from the gaze of those about us. I pushed away a candle that\nflared in our faces.\n\n\"You never drink wine?\"\n\n\"No, Cassandra.\"\n\n\"How was the ride down?\"\n\n\"Delightful.\"\n\n\"What about the new horse?\"\n\n\"He is an awful brute.\"\n\n\"When shall we have a ride with him?\"\n\n\"When you please.\"\n\nThe boy came in to say would we please go to the parlor; our room was\nwanted for supper. An immediate rush, with loud laughing, took place,\nfor the parlor fire; but Charles and I did not move. I was busy\nremaking the bow of my purple silk cravat.\n\n\"'I drink the cup of a costly death,'\" Ben hummed, as he sauntered\nalong by us, hands in his pockets--the last in the room, except us\ntwo.\n\n\"Indeed, Somers; perhaps you would like this too.\" And Charles offered\nhim his glass of wine.\n\nBen took it, and with his thumb and finger snapped it off at the stem,\ntipping the wine over Charles's hand.\n\nI saw it staining his wristband, like blood. He did not stir, but a\nslight smile traveled swiftly over his face.\n\n\"I know Veronica,\" said Ben, looking at me. \"Has this man seen _her_?\"\n\nHis voice crushed me. What a barrier his expression of contempt made\nbetween her and me!\n\nWithal, I felt a humiliating sense of defeat.\n\nCharles read me.\n\nAs he folded his wristband under his sleeve, carefully and slowly, his\nslender fingers did not tremble with the desire that possessed him,\nwhich I saw in his terrible eyes as plainly as if he had spoken, \"I\nwould kill him.\"\n\nThey looked at my hands, for I was wringing them, and a groan burst\nfrom me.\n\n\"Somers,\" said Charles, rising and touching his shoulder, \"behave like\na man, and let us alone; I love this girl.\"\n\nHis pale face changed, his eyes softened, and mine filled with tears.\n\n\"Cassandra,\" urged Ben, in a gentle voice, \"come with me; come away.\"\n\n\"Fool,\" I answered; \"leave _me_ alone, and go.\"\n\nHe hesitated, moved toward the door, and again urged me to come.\n\n\"Go! go!\" stamping my foot, and the door closed without a sound.\n\nFor a moment we stood, transfixed in an isolation which separated us\nfrom all the world beside.\n\n\"Now Charles, we\"--a convulsive sob choked me, a strange taste filled\nmy mouth, I put my handkerchief to my lips and wiped away streaks of\nblood. I showed it to him.\n\n\"It is nothing, by God!\" snatching the handkerchief. \"Take mine--oh,\nmy dear--\"\n\nI tried to laugh, and muttered the imperative fact of joining the\nrest.\n\n\"Be quiet, Cassandra.\"\n\nHe opened the window, took a handful of snow from the sill and put it\nto my mouth. It revived me.\n\n\"Do you hear, Charles? Never say those frightful words again. Never,\nnever.\"\n\n\"Never, if it must be so.\"\n\nHe touched my hand; I opened it; his closed over mine.\n\n\"Go, now,\" he said, and springing to the window, threw it up, and\njumped out. The boy came in with a tablecloth on his arm, and behind\nhim Ben.\n\n\"Glass broken, sir.\"\n\n\"Put it in the bill.\"\n\nHe offered me his arm, which I was glad to take.\n\n\"Where is Charles?\" Alice asked, when we went in.\n\n\"He has just left us,\" Ben answered; \"looking after his horses,\nprobably.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she replied. \"You look blue, Cass. Here, take my chair by\nthe fire; we are going to dance a Virginia reel.\"\n\nI accepted her offer, and was thankful that the dance would take them\naway. I wanted to be alone forever. Helen glided behind my chair, and\nlaid her hand on my shoulder; I shook it off.\n\n\"What is the matter, Cass?\"\n\n\"I am going away from Char--school.\"\n\n\"We are all going; but not to-night.\"\n\n\"I am going to-night.\"\n\n\"So you shall, dear; but wait till after supper.\"\n\n\"Do you think, Helen, that I shall ever have consumption?\" fumbling\nfor my handkerchief, forgetting in whose possession it was. Charles\ncame in at that instant, and I remembered that he had it.\n\n\"What on earth has happened to you? Oh!\" she exclaimed, as I looked at\nher. \"You were out there with Morgeson and Ben Somers,\" she whispered;\n\"something has occurred; what is it?\"\n\n\"You shall never know; never--never--never.\"\n\n\"Cassandra, that man is a devil.\"\n\n\"I like devils.\"\n\n\"The same blood rages in both of you.\"\n\n\"It's mulled wine,--thick and stupid.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"Will there be tea, at supper?\"\n\n\"You shall have some.\"\n\n\"Ask Ben to order it.\"\n\n\"Heaven forgive us all, Cassandra!\"\n\n\"Remember the tea.\"\n\nCharles stood near his wife; wherever she moved afterwards he moved.\nI saw it, and felt that it was the shadow of something which would\nfollow.\n\nAt last the time came for us to return. Helen had plied me with tea,\nand was otherwise watchful, but scarcely spoke.\n\n\"It is an age,\" I said, \"since I left Rosville.\"\n\nShe raised her eyebrows merely, and asked me if I would have more tea.\n\n\"In my room,\" I thought, \"I shall find myself again.\" And as I opened\nmy door, it welcomed me with so friendly and silent an aspect, that I\nbetrayed my grief, and it covered my misery as with a cloak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\n\nHelen was called home by the illness of her father and did not return\nto Rosville. She would write me, she said; but it was many weeks\nbefore I received a letter. Ben Somers about this time took a fit of\nindustry, and made a plan for what he called a well-regulated life,\naverring that he should always abide by it. Every hour had its duty,\nwhich must be fulfilled. He weighed his bread and meat, ate so many\nounces a day, and slept watch and watch, as he nautically termed it.\nI guessed that the meaning of his plan was to withdraw from the\nself-chosen post of censor. His only alienation was an occasional\ndisappearance for a few days. I never asked him where he went, and had\nnever spoken to him concerning his mysterious remark about having\nbeen in Surrey. Neither had I heard anything of his being there from\nfather. Once he told me that his father had explained the marriage of\nold Locke Morgeson; but that it was not clear to him that we were at\nall related.\n\nIn consequence of his rigorous life, I saw little of him. Though\nurged by Alice, he did not come to our house, and we rarely met him\nelsewhere. People called him eccentric, but as he was of a rich family\nhe could afford to be, and they felt no slight by his neglect.\n\nThere was a change everywhere. The greatest change of all was in\nCharles. From the night of the sleigh-ride his manner toward me was\ntotally altered. As far as I could discern, the change was a confirmed\none. The days grew monotonous, but my mind avenged itself by night in\ndreams, which renewed our old relation in all its mysterious vitality.\nSo strong were their impressions that each morning I expected to\nreceive some token from him which would prove that they were not\nlies. As my expectation grew cold and faint, the sense of a double\nhallucination tormented me--the past and the present.\n\nThe winter was over. I passed it like the rest of Rosville, going out\nwhen Alice went, staying at home when she stayed. It was all one what\nI did, for my aspect was one of content.\n\nAlice alone was unchanged; her spirits and pursuits were always the\nsame. Judging by herself, if she judged at all, she perceived no\nchange in us. Her theory regarding Charles was too firm to be shaken,\nand all his oddity was a matter of course. As long as I ate, and\ndrank, and slept as usual, I too must be the same. He was not at home\nmuch. Business, kept him at the mills, where he often slept, or out of\ntown. But the home machinery was still under his controlling hand. Not\na leaf dropped in the conservatory that he did not see; not a meal\nwas served whose slightest detail was not according to his desire. The\nhorses were exercised, the servants managed, the children kept within\nbounds; nothing in the formula of our daily life was ever dropped, and\nyet I scarcely ever saw him! When we met, I shared his attentions. He\ngave me flowers; noticed my dress; spoke of the affairs of the day;\nbut all in so public and matter-of-fact a way that I thought I must be\nthe victim of a vicious sentimentality, or that he had amused himself\nwith me. Either way, the sooner I cured myself of my vice the better.\nBut my dreams continued.\n\n\"I miss something in your letters,\" father complained. \"What is it?\nWould you like to come home? Your mother is failing in health--she may\nneed you, though she says not.\"\n\nI wrote him that I should come home.\n\n\"Are you prepared,\" he asked in return, \"to remain at home for the\nfuture? Have you laid the foundation of anything by which you can\nabide contented, and employed? Veronica has been spending two months\nin New York, with the family of one of my business friends. All that\nshe brings back serves to embellish her quiet life, not to change it.\nWill it be so with you?\"\n\nI wrote back, \"No; but I am coming.\"\n\nHe wrote again of changes in Surrey. Dr. Snell had gone, library and\nall, and a new minister, red hot from Andover, had taken his place. An\nugly new church was building. His best ship, the _Locke Morgeson_,\nwas at the bottom of the Indian Ocean, he had just heard. Her loss\nbothered him, but his letters were kinder than ever.\n\nI consulted with Alice about leaving the Academy. She approved\nmy plan, but begged me not to leave her. I said nothing of my\ndetermination to that effect, feeling a strange disinclination toward\nowning it, though I persisted in repeating it to myself. I applied\ndiligently to my reading, emulating Ben Somers in the regularity of\nmy habits, and took long walks daily--a mode of exercise I had adopted\nsince I had ceased my rides with Charles. The pale blue sky of spring\nover me, and the pale green grass under me, were charming perhaps;\nbut there was the same monotony in them, as in other things. I did not\nfrequent our old promenade, Silver Street, but pushed my walks\ninto the outskirts of Rosville, by farms bordered with woods. My\nschoolmates, who were familiar with all the pleasant spots of the\nneighborhood, met me in groups. \"Are you really taking walks like the\nrest of us?\" they asked. \"Only alone,\" I answered.\n\nI bade farewell at last to Miss Prior. We parted with all friendliness\nand respect; from the fact, possibly, that we parted ignorant of each\nother. It was the most rational relation that I had ever held with any\none. We parted without emotion or regret, and I started on my usual\nwalk.\n\nAs I was returning I met Ben Somers. When he saw me he threw his cap\ninto the air, with the information that he had done with his plans,\nand had ordered an indigestible supper, in honor of his resolve. As\npeople had truly remarked, he could afford to be eccentric. He was\ntired of it; he had money enough to do without law. \"Not as much as\nyour cousin Morgeson, who can do without the Gospel, too.\"\n\nThis was the first time that he had referred to Charles since that\nmemorable night. Trifling as his words were, they broke into the\nfoundations of my stagnant will, and set the tide flowing once more.\n\n\"You went to Surrey.\"\n\n\"I was there a few hours. Your father was not at home. He asked me\nthere, you remember. I introduced myself, therefore, and was politely\nreceived by your mother, who sent for Veronica. She came in with an\noccupied air, her hands full of what I thought were herbs; but they\nwere grasses, which she had been re-arranging, she said.\n\n\"'You know my sister?' she asked, coming close, and looking at me with\nthe most singular eyes that were ever on earth.\" He stopped a moment.\n\"Not like yours, in the least,\" he continued. \"'Cassandra is very\nhandsome now, is she?'\n\n\"'Why, Veronica,' said your mother, 'you astonish Mr. Somers.'\n\n\"'You are not astonished,' she said with vehemence, 'you are\nembarrassed.'\n\n\"'Upon my soul I am,' I replied, feeling at ease as soon as I had said\nso.\n\n\"'Tell me, what has Cassandra been taught? Is Rosville suited to her?\nWe are not.'\n\n\"'Veronica!' said your mother again.\n\n\"'Mother,\" and she shook the grasses, and made a little snow fall\nround her; 'what shall I say then? I am sure he knows Cassandra. What\ndid you come here for?' turning to me again.\n\n\"'To see you,' I answered foolishly.\n\n\"'And has Cassandra spoken of me?' Her pale face grew paler, and an\nindescribable expression passed over it. 'I do not often speak of\nher.'\n\n\"'She does not of you,' I was obliged to answer. And then I said I\nmust go. But your mother made me dine with them. When I came away\nVeronica offered me her hand, but she sent no message to you. She has\nnever been out of my mind a moment since.\"\n\n\"You remember the particulars of the interview very well.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Would she bear your supervision?\"\n\n\"Forgive me, Cassandra. Have I not been making a hermit of myself,\neating bread and meat by the ounce, for an expiation?\"\n\n\"How did it look there? Oh, tell me!\"\n\n\"You strange girl, have you a soul then? It is a grand place, where\nit has not been meddled with. I hired a man to drive me as far as any\npaths went, into those curving horns of land, on each side of Surrey\nto the south. The country is crazy with barrenness, and the sea mocks\nit with its terrible beauty.\"\n\n\"You will visit us, won't you?\"\n\n\"Certainly; I intend to go there.\"\n\n\"Do you know that I left school to-day?\"\n\n\"It is time.\"\n\nI hurried into the house, for I did not wish to hear any questions\nfrom him concerning my future. Charlotte, who was rolling up an\numbrella in the hall, said it was tea-time, adding that Mr. Morgeson\nhad come, and that he was in the dining-room. I went upstairs to leave\nmy bonnet. As I pulled off my glove the ring on my finger twisted\nround. I took it off, for the first time since Charles had given it\nto me. A sense of haste came upon me; my hands trembled. I brushed\nmy hair with the back of the brush, shook it out, and wound it into\na loose mass, thrust in my comb and went down. Charlotte was putting\ncandles on the tea table. Edward was on his father's knee; Alice was\nwaiting by the tray.\n\n\"Here--is--Cassandra,\" said Charles, mentioning the fact as if he\nmerely wished to attract the child's attention.\n\n\"Here--is--Cassandra,\" I repeated, imitating his tone. He started.\nSome devil broke loose in him, and looking through his eyes an\ninstant, disappeared, like a maniac who looks through the bars of his\ncell, and dodges from the eye of his keeper. Jesse brought me a letter\nwhile we were at the table. It was from Helen. I broke its seal to see\nhow long it was, and put it aside.\n\n\"I am free, Alice. I have left the Academy, and am going to set up for\nan independent woman.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Charles; \"you did not tell me. Did you know it, Alice?\"\n\n\"Yes; we can't expect her to be at school all her days.\"\n\n\"Cassandra,\" he said suddenly, \"will you give me the salt?\"\n\nHe looked for the ring on the hand which I stretched toward him.\n\nHe not only missed that, but he observed the disregard of his wishes\nin the way I had arranged my hair. I shook it looser from the comb and\npushed it from my face. An expression of unspeakable passion, pride,\nand anguish came into his eyes; his mouth trembled; he caught up a\nglass of water to hide his face, and drank slowly from it.\n\n\"Are you going away again soon?\" Alice asked him presently.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"To keep Cassandra, I intend to ask Mrs. Morgeson to come again. Will\nyou write Mr. Morgeson to urge it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I shall ask them to give up Cass altogether to us.\"\n\n\"You like her so much, do you, Alice?\"\n\nHis voice sounded far off and faint.\n\nAgain I refrained from speaking my resolution of going home. I would\ngive up thinking of it even! I felt again the tension of the chain\nbetween us. That night I ceased to dream of him.\n\n\"My letter is from Helen, Alice,\" I said.\n\n\"When did you see Somers?\" Charles asked.\n\n\"To-day. I have an idea he will not remain here long.\"\n\n\"He is an amusing young man,\" Alice remarked.\n\n\"Very,\" said Charles.\n\nHelen's letter was long and full of questions. What had I done? How\nhad I been? She gave an account of her life at home. She was her\nfather's nurse, and seldom left him. It was a dreary sort of business,\nbut she was not melancholy. In truth, she felt better pleased with\nherself than she had been in Rosville. She could not help thinking\nthat a chronic invalid would be a good thing for me. How was Ben\nSomers? How much longer should I stay in Rosville? It would know us no\nmore forever when we left, and both of us would leave it at the same\ntime. Would I visit her ever? They lived in a big house with a red\nfront door. On the left was a lane with tall poplars dying on each\nside of it, up which the cows passed every night. At the back of it\nwas a huge barn round which martins and pigeons flew the year through.\nIt was dull but respectable and refined, and no one knew that she was\ntattooed on the arm.\n\nI treasured this letter and all she wrote me. It was my first\nschool-girl correspondence and my last.\n\nRelations of Alice came from a distance to pay her a visit. There was\na father, a mother, a son about twenty-one, and two girls who were\nyounger. Alice wished that they had stayed at home; but she was polite\nand endeavored to make their visit agreeable. The son, called by his\nfamily \"Bill,\" informed Charles that he was a judge of horseflesh, and\nwould like to give his nags a try, having a high-flyer himself at\nhome that the old gentleman would not hear of his bringing along. His\nactions denoted an admiration of me. He looked over the book I was\nreading or rummaged my workbox, trying on my thimble with an air of\ntenderness, and peeping into my needlebook. He told Alice that he\nthought I was a whole team and a horse to let, but he felt rather\nbalky when he came near me, I had such a smartish eye.\n\n\"What am I to do, marm?\" asked Jesse one morning when Charles was\naway. \"That ere young man wants to ride the new horse, and it is jist\nthe one he mus'n't ride.\"\n\n\"I will speak to Cousin Bill myself,\" she said.\n\n\"He seems a sperrited young feller, and if he wants to break his neck\nit's most a pity he shouldn't.\"\n\n\"I think,\" she said when Jesse had retired, \"that Charles must be\nsaving up that beast to kill himself with. He will not pull a chaise\nyet.\"\n\n\"Has Charles tried him?\"\n\n\"In the lane in an open wagon. He has a whim of having him broken to\ndrive without blinders, bare of harness; he has been away so of late\nthat he has not accomplished it.\"\n\nBill entered while we were talking, and Alice told him he must not\nattempt to use the horse, but proposed he should take her pair and\ndrive out with me. I shook my head in vain; she was bent on mischief.\nHe was mollified by the proposal, and I was obliged to get ready. On\nstarting he placed his cap on one side, held his whip upright, telling\nme that it was not up to the mark in length, and doubled his knuckles\nover the reins. He was a good Jehu, but I could not induce him to\nobserve anything along the road.\n\n\"Where's Mr. Morgeson's mills?\"\n\nWe turned in their direction.\n\n\"He is a man of property, ain't he?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"He has prime horses anyhow. That stallion of his would bring a\nfirst-rate price if he wanted to sell. Do you play the piano?\"\n\n\"A little.\"\n\n\"And sing?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I have not heard you. Will you sing '_A place in thy memory,\ndearest,'_ some time for me?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Are you fond of flowers and the like?\"\n\n\"Very fond of them.\"\n\n\"So am I; our tastes agree. Here we are, hey?\"\n\nCharles came out when he saw us coming over the bridge, and Bill\npulled up the horses scientifically, giving him a coachman's salute.\n\"You see I am quite a whip.\"\n\n\"You are,\" said Charles.\n\n\"What a cub!\" he whispered me. \"I think I'll give up my horses and\ntake to walking as you have.\"\n\nOn the way home Bill held the reins in one hand and attempted to take\nmine with the other, a proceeding which I checked, whereupon he was\nexceedingly confused. The whip fell from his clutch over the dasher,\nand in recovering it his hat fell off; shame kept him silent for the\nrest of the ride.\n\nI begged Alice to propose no more rides with Cousin Bill. That night\nhe composed a letter which he sent me by Charlotte early the next\nmorning.\n\n\"Why, Charlotte, what nonsense is this?\"\n\n\"I expect,\" she answered sympathizingly, \"that it is an offer of his\nhand and heart.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it, Charlotte.\"\n\n\"Never while I have breath.\"\n\nIn an hour she told Phoebe, who told Alice, who told Charles, and\nthere it ended. It was an offer, as Charlotte predicted. My first! I\nwas crestfallen! I wrote a reply, waited till everybody had gone to\nbreakfast, and slipping into his room, pinned it to the pincushion.\nIn the evening he asked if I ever sang \"_Should these fond hopes e'er\nforsake thee.\"_ I gave him the \"_Pirate's Serenade_\" instead, which\nhis mother declared beautiful. I saw Alice and Charles laughing,\nand could hardly help joining them, when I looked at Bill, in whose\ncountenance relief and grief were mingled.\n\nIt was a satisfaction to us when they went away. Their visit was\nshortened, I suspected, by the representations Bill made to his\nmother. She said, \"Good-by,\" with coldness; but he shook hands with\nme, and said it was all right he supposed.\n\nThe day they went I had a letter from father which informed me that\nmother would not come to Rosville. He reminded me that I had been\nin Rosville over a year. \"I am going home soon,\" I said to myself,\nputting away the letter. It was a summer day, bright and hot. Alice,\nbusy all day, complained of fatigue and went to bed soon after tea.\nThe windows were open and the house was perfumed with odors from\nthe garden. At twilight I went out and walked under the elms, whose\npendant boughs were motionless. I watched the stars as they came out\none by one above the pale green ring of the horizon and glittered in\nthe evening sky, which darkened slowly. I was coming up the gravel\nwalk when I heard a step at the upper end of it which arrested me. I\nrecognized it, and slipped behind a tree to wait till it should pass\nby me; but it ceased, and I saw Charles pulling off a twig of the\ntree, which brushed against his face. Presently he sprang round the\ntree, caught me, and held me fast.\n\n\"I am glad you are here, my darling. Do you smell the roses?\"\n\n\"Yes; let me go.\"\n\n\"Not till you tell me one thing. Why do you stay in Rosville?\"\n\nThe baby gave a loud cry in Alice's chamber which resounded through\nthe garden.\n\n\"Go and take care of your baby,\" I said roughly, \"and not busy\nyourself with me.\"\n\n\"Cassandra,\" he said, with a menacing voice, \"how dare you defy me?\nHow dare you tempt me?\"\n\nI put my hand on his arm. \"Charles, is love a matter of temperament?\"\n\n\"Are you mad? It is life--it is heaven--it is hell.\"\n\n\"There is something in this soft, beautiful, odorous night that makes\none mad. Still I shall not say to you what you once said to me.\"\n\n\"Ah! you do not forget those words--'_I love you_.'\"\n\nSome one came down the lane which ran behind the garden whistling an\nopera air.\n\n\"There is your Providence,\" he said quietly, resting his hand against\nthe tree.\n\nI ran round to the front piazza, just as Ben Somers turned out of the\nlane, and called him.\n\n\"I have wandered all over Rosville since sunset,\" he said \"and at last\nstruck upon that lane. To whom does it belong?\"\n\n\"It is ours, and the horses are exercised there.\"\n\n       \"'In such a night,\n  Troilus, methinks, mounted the Trojan walls,\n  And sighed his soul towards the Grecian tents,\n  Where Cressid lay that night.'\"\n\n       '\"In such a night,\n  Stood Dido with a willow in her hand,\n  Upon the wild sea banks, and waved her love\n  To come again to Carthage.'\"\n\n\"Talk to me about Surrey, Cassandra.\"\n\n\"Not a word.\"\n\n\"Why did you call me?\"\n\n\"To see what mood you were in.\"\n\n\"How disagreeable you are! What is the use of venturing one's mood\nwith you?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n\nAlice called me to her chamber window one morning. \"Look into the\nlane. Charles and Jesse are there with that brute. He goes very well,\nnow that they have thrown the top of the chaise back; he quivered like\na jelly at first.\"\n\n\"I must have a ride, Alice.\"\n\n\"Charles,\" she called. \"Breakfast is waiting.\"\n\n\"What shall be his name, girls?\" he asked.\n\n\"Aspen,\" I suggested.\n\n\"That will do,\" said Alice.\n\n\n\"Shall we ride soon?\" I asked.\n\n\"Will you?\" he spoke quickly. \"In a day or two, then.\"\n\n\"Know what you undertake, Cass,\" said Alice.\n\n\"She always does,\" he answered.\n\n\"Let me go, papa,\" begged Edward.\n\n\"By and by, my boy.\"\n\n\"What a compliment, Cass! He does not object to venture you.\"\n\nHe proposed Fairtown, six miles from Rosville, as he had business\nthere. The morning we were to go proved cloudy, and we waited till\nafternoon, when Charles, declaring that it would not rain, ordered\nAspen to be harnessed. I went into Alice's room tying my bonnet; he\nwas there, leaning over the baby's crib, who lay in it crowing and\nlaughing at the snapping of his fingers. Alice was hemming white\nmuslin.\n\n\"Take a shawl with you, Cass; I think it will rain, the air is so\nheavy.\"\n\n\"I guess not,\" said Charles, going to the window. \"What a nuisance\nthat lane is, so near the garden! I'll have it plowed soon, and\nenclosed.\"\n\n\"For all those wild primroses you value so?\" she asked.\n\n\"I'll spare those.\"\n\nCharlotte came to tell us that the chaise was ready.\n\n\"Good-bye, Alice,\" he said, passing her, and giving her work a toss up\nto the ceiling.\n\n\"Be careful.\"\n\n\"Take care, sir,\" said Penn, after we were in the chaise, \"and don't\ngive way to him; if you do, he'll punish you. May be he feels the\nthunder in the air.\"\n\nWe reached Fairtown without any indication of mischief from Aspen,\nalthough he trotted along as if under protest. Charles was delighted,\nand thought he would be very fast, by the time he was trained. It grew\nmurky and hot every moment, and when we reached Fairtown the air was\nblack and sultry with the coming storm. Charles left me at the little\nhotel, and returned so late in the afternoon that we decided not to\nwait for the shower. Two men led Aspen to the door. He pulled at his\nbridle, and attempted to run backward, playing his old trick of trying\nto turn his nostrils inside out, and drawing back his upper lip.\n\n\"Something irritates him, Charles.\"\n\n\"If you are afraid, you must not come with me. I can have you sent\nhome in a carriage from the tavern.\"\n\n\"I shall go back with you.\"\n\nBut I felt a vague alarm, and begged him to watch Aspen, and not talk.\nAspen went faster and faster, seeming to have lost his shyness, and my\nfears subsided. We were within a couple of miles of Rosville, when a\nsplashing rain fell.\n\n\"You must not be wet,\" said Charles. \"I will put up the top. Aspen is\nso steady now, it may not scare him.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" I said; but he had it up already, and asked me to snap the\nspring on my side. I had scarcely taken my arm inside the chaise when\nAspen stopped, turned his head, and looked at us with glazed eyes;\nflakes of foam flew from his mouth over his mane. The flesh on his\nback contracted and quivered. I thought he was frightened by the\nchaise-top, and looked at Charles in terror.\n\n\"He has some disorder,\" he cried. \"Oh, Cassandra! My God!\"\n\nHe tried to spring at his head, but was too late, for the horse was\nleaping madly. He fell back on his seat.\n\n\"If he will keep the road,\" he muttered.\n\nI could not move my eyes from him. How pale he was! But he did\nnot speak again. The horse ran a few rods, leaped across a ditch,\nclambered up a stone wall with his fore-feet, and fell backward!\n\nDr. White was in my room, washing my face. There was a smell of\ncamphor about the bed. \"You crawled out of a small hole, my child,\" he\nsaid, as I opened my eyes. It was quite dark, but I saw people at\nthe door, and two or three at the foot of my bed, and I heard low,\nconstrained talking everywhere.\n\n\"His iron feet made a dreadful noise on the stones, Doctor!\"\n\nI shut my eyes again and dozed. Suddenly a great tumult came to my\nheart.\n\n\"Was he killed?\" I cried, and tried to rise from the bed. \"Let me go,\nwill you?\"\n\n\"He is dead,\" whispered Dr. White.\n\nI laughed loudly.\n\n\"Be a good girl--be a good girl. Get out, all of you. Here, Miss\nPrior.\"\n\n\"You are crying, Doctor; my eyes feel dry.\"\n\n\"Pooh, pooh, little one. Now I am going to set your arm; simple\nfracture, that's all. The blow was tempered, but you are paralyzed by\nthe shock.\"\n\n\"Miss Prior, is my face cut?\"\n\n\"Not badly, my dear.\"\n\nMy arm was set, my face bandaged, some opium administered, and then\nI was left alone with Miss Prior. I grew drowsy, but suffered so from\nthe illusion that I was falling out of bed that I could not sleep.\n\nIt was near morning when I shook off my drowsiness and looked about;\nMiss Prior was nodding in an arm-chair. I asked for drink, and when\nshe gave it to me, begged her to lie down on the sofa; she did not\nneed urging, and was soon asleep.\n\n\"What room is he in?\" I thought. \"I must know where he is.\"\n\nI sat up in the bed, and pushed myself out by degrees, keeping my eyes\non Miss Prior; but she did not stir. I staggered when I got into the\npassage, but the cool air from some open window revived me, and I\ncrept on, stopping at Alice's door to listen. I heard a child murmur\nin its sleep. He could not be there. The doors of all the\nchambers were locked, and I must go downstairs. I went into the\ngarden-room--the door was open, the scent of roses came in and made me\ndeadly sick; into the dining-room, and into the parlor--he was there,\nlying on a table covered with a sheet. Alice sat on the floor, her\nface hid in her hands, crying softly. I touched her. She started on\nseeing me. \"Go away, Cassy, for God's sake! How came you out of bed?\"\n\n\"Hush! Tell me!\" And I went down on the floor beside her. \"Was he dead\nwhen they found us?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"What was said? Did you hear?\"\n\n\"They said he must have made a violent effort to save you. The side\nof the chaise was torn. The horse kicked him after you were thrust out\nover the wheel. Or did you creep out?\"\n\nI groaned. \"Why did he thrust me out?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Where is Aspen?\"\n\nShe pointed to the stable. \"He had a fit. Penn says he has had one\nbefore; but he thought him cured. He stood quiet in the ditch after he\nhad broken from the chaise.\"\n\n\"Alice, did you love him?\"\n\n\"My husband!\"\n\nA door near us opened, and Ben Somers and young Parker looked in. They\nwere the watchers. Parker went back when he saw me; but Ben came in.\nHe knelt down by me, put his arm around me, and said, \"Poor girl!\"\nAlice raised her tear-stained face, looking at me curiously, when\nhe said this. She took hold of my streaming hair and pulled my head\nround. \"Did _you_ love him?\" Ben rose quickly and went to the window.\n\n\"Alice!\" I whispered, \"you may or you may not forgive me, but I was\nstrangely bound to him. And I must tell you that I hunger now for the\nkiss he never gave me.\"\n\n\"I see. Enough. Go back to your room. I must stay by him till all is\nover.\"\n\n\"I can't go back. Ben!\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Take me upstairs.\"\n\nRaising me in his arms, he whispered: \"Leave him forever, body and\nsoul. I am not sorry he is dead.\" He called Charlotte on the way, and\nwith her he put me to back to bed. I asked him to let me see the dress\nthey had taken off.\n\n\"That is enough,\" I said, \"Charles broke my arm.\"\n\nIt was torn through the shoulder, and the skirt had been twisted like\na rope. Ben made no reply, but bent over me and kissed me tenderly.\nAll this time Miss Prior had slept the sleep of the just; but he had\nbarely gone when she started up and said, \"Did you call, my dear?\"\n\n\"No, it is day.\"\n\n\"So it is; but you must sleep more.\"\n\nI could not obey, and kept awake so long that Dr. White said he\nhimself should go crazy unless I slept.\n\n\"Presently, presently,\" I reiterated; \"and am I going home?\"\n\nAt last my mind went astray; it journeyed into a dismal world, and\ncame back without an account of its adventures. While it was gone,\nmy friends were summoned to witness a contest, where the odds were\nin favor of death. But I recovered. Whether it was youth, a good\nconstitution, or the skill of Dr. White, no one could decide. It was a\nfaint, feeble, fluttering return at first. The faces round me, mobile\nwith life, wearied me. I was indifferent to existence, and was more\nthan once in danger of lapsing into the void I had escaped.\n\nWhen I first tottered downstairs, he had been buried more than three\nweeks. It was a bright morning; the windows of the parlor, where\nCharlotte led me, were open. Little Edward was playing round the table\nupon which I had seen his father stretched, dead. I measured it with\nmy eye, remembering how tall he looked. I would have retreated, when\nI saw that Alice had visitors, but it was too late. They rose, and\noffered congratulations. I was angry that there was no change in the\nhouse. The rooms should have been dismantled, reflecting disorder and\ndeath, by their perpetual darkness and disorder. It was not so. No\ndust had been allowed to gather on the furniture, no wrinkles or\nstains. No mist on the mirrors, no dimness anywhere. Alice was\nelegantly dressed, in the deepest mourning. I examined her with a\ncynical eye; her bombazine was trimmed with crape, and the edge of her\ncollar was beautifully crimped. A mourning brooch fastened it, and\nshe wore jet ear-rings. She looked handsome, composed, and contented,\nholding a black-edged handkerchief. Charlotte had placed my chair\nopposite a glass; I caught sight of my elongated visage in it. How\ndull I looked! My hair was faded and rough; my eyes were a pale,\nlusterless blue. The visitors departed, while I still contemplated my\nrueful aspect, and Alice and I were alone.\n\n\"I want some broth, Alice. I am hungry.\"\n\n\"How many bowls have you had this morning?\"\n\n\"Only two.\"\n\n\"You must wait an hour for the third; it is not twelve o'clock.\"\n\nWe were silent. The flies buzzed in and out of the windows; a great\nbee flew in, tumbled against the panes, loudly hummed, and after a\nwhile got out again. Alice yawned, and I pulled the threads out of the\nborder of my handkerchief.\n\n\"The hour is up; I will get your broth.\"\n\n\"Bring me a great deal.\"\n\nShe came back with a thin, impoverished liquid.\n\n\"There is no chicken in it,\" I said tearfully.\n\n\"I took it out.\"\n\n\"How could you?\" And I wept.\n\nShe smiled. \"You are very weak, but shall have a bit.\" She went for\nit, returning with an infinitesimal portion of chicken.\n\n\"What a young creature it must have been, Alice!\"\n\nShe laughed, promising me more, by and by.\n\n\"Now you must lie down. Take my arm and come to the sofa.\n\n\"Not here; let us go into another room.\"\n\n\"Come, then.\"\n\n\"Don't leave me,\" I begged, after she had arranged me comfortably. She\nsat down by me with a fan.\n\n\"What happened while I was ill?\"\n\nShe fanned rapidly for an instant, taking thought what to say.\n\n\"I shot Aspen, a few days after.\"\n\n\"With your own hand?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"Penn protested, said I interfered with Providence. Jesse added, also,\nthat what had happened was ordained, and no mistake, and then I sent\nthem both away.\"\n\n\"And I am going at last, Alice; father will be here again in a few\ndays.\"\n\n\"You did not recognize Veronica, when they came.\"\n\n\"Was she here?\"\n\n\"Yes, and went the same day. What great tears rolled down her\nunmovable face, when she stood by your bed! She would not stay; the\natmosphere distressed her so, she went back to Boston to wait for your\nfather. I could neither prevail on her to eat, drink, or rest.\"\n\n\"What will you do, Alice?\"\n\n\"Take care of the children, and manage the mills.\"\n\n\"Manage the mills?\"\n\n\"I can. No wonder you look astonished,\" she said, with a sigh. \"I am\nchanged. When perhaps I should feel that I have done with life, I am\neager to begin it. I have lamented over myself lately.\"\n\n\"How is Ben?\"\n\n\"He has been here often. How strange it was that to him alone Veronica\ngave her hand when they met! Indeed, she gave him both her hands.\"\n\n\"And he?\"\n\n\"Took them, bowing over them, till I thought he wasn't coming up\nagain. I do not call people eccentric any more,\" she said, faintly\nblushing. \"I look for a reason in every action. Tell me fairly, have\nyou had a contempt for me--for my want of perception? I understand you\nnow, to the bone and marrow, I assure you.\"\n\n\"Then you understand more than I do. But you will remember that once\nor twice I attempted to express my doubts to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, with a candor which misled me. But you are talking too\nmuch.\"\n\n\"Give me more broth, then.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n\nI was soon well enough to go home. Father came for me, bringing Aunt\nMerce. There was no alteration in her, except that she had taken to\nwearing a false front, which had a claret tinge when the light struck\nit, and a black lace cap. She walked the room in speechless distress\nwhen she saw me, and could not refrain from taking an immense pinch of\nsnuff in my presence.\n\n\"Didn't you bring any flag-root, Aunt Merce?\"\n\n\"Oh Lord, Cassandra, won't anything upon earth change you?\"\n\nAnd then we both laughed, and felt comfortable together. Her knitting\nmania had given way to one she called transferring. She brought a\nlittle basket filled with rags, worn-out embroideries, collars, cuffs,\nand edges of handkerchiefs, from which she cut the needle-work, to sew\nagain on new muslin. She looked at embroidery with an eye merely to\nits capacity for being transferred. Alice proved a treasure to her,\nby giving her heaps of fine work. She and Aunt Merce were pleased with\neach other, and when we were ready to come away, Alice begged her to\nvisit her every year. I made no farewell visits--my ill health was\nsufficient excuse; but my schoolmates came to bid me good-bye, and\nbrought presents of needlebooks, and pincushions, which I returned by\ngiving away yards of ribbon, silver fruit-knives, and Mrs. Hemans's\npoems, which poetess had lately given my imagination an apostrophizing\ndirection. Miss Prior came also, with a copy of \"Young's Night\nThoughts,\" bound in speckled leather This hilarious and refreshing\npoem remained at the bottom of my trunk, till Temperance fished it\nout, to read on Sundays, in her own room, where she usually passed her\nhours of solitude in hemming dish-towels, or making articles called\n\"Takers.\" Dr. Price came, too, and even the haughty four Ryders. Alice\nwas gratified with my popularity. But I felt cold at heart, doubtful\nof myself, drifting to nothingness in thought and purpose. None saw my\ndoubts or felt my coldness.\n\nI shook hands with all, exchanged hopes and wishes, and repeated the\nlast words which people say on departure. Alice and I neither kissed\nnor shook hands. There was that between us which kept us apart.\nA hard, stern face was still in our recollection. We remembered a\ncertain figure, whose steps had ceased about the house, whose voice\nwas hushed, but who was potent yet.\n\n\"We shall not forget each other,\" she said.\n\nAnd so I took my way out of Rosville. Ben Somers went with us to\nBoston, and stayed at the Bromfield. In the morning he disappeared,\nand when he returned had an emerald ring, which he begged me to wear,\nand tried to put it on my finger, where he had seen the diamond. I put\nit back in its box, thanking him, and saying it must be stored with\nthe farewell needlebooks and pincushions.\n\n\"Shall we have some last words now?\"\n\nAunt Merce slipped out, with an affectation of not having heard him.\nWe laughed, and Ben was glad that I could laugh.\n\n\"How do you feel?\"\n\n\"Rather weak still.\"\n\n\"I do not mean so, but in your mind; how are you?\"\n\n\"I have no mind.\"\n\n\"Must I give up trying to understand you, Cassandra?\"\n\n\"Yes, do. You'll visit Alice? You can divine her intentions. She is a\ngood woman.\"\n\n\"She will be, when she knows how.\"\n\n\"What o'clock is it?\"\n\n\"Incorrigible! Near ten.\"\n\n\"Here is father, and we must start.\"\n\nThe carriage was ready; where was Aunt Merce?\n\n\"Locke,\" she said, when she came in, \"I have got a bottle of port for\nCassandra, some essence of peppermint, and sandwiches; do you think\nthat will do?\"\n\n\"We can purchase supplies along the road, if yours give out. Come, we\nare ready. Mr. Somers, we shall see you at Surrey? Take care, Cassy.\nNow we are off.\"\n\n\"I shall leave Rosville,\" were Ben's last words.\n\n\"What a fine, handsome young man he is! He is a gentleman,\" said Aunt\nMerce.\n\n\"Of course, Aunt Merce.\"\n\n\"Why of course? I should think from the way you speak that you had\nonly seen young gentlemen of his stamp. Have you forgotten Surrey?\"\n\nFather and she laughed. They could laugh very easily, for they were\noverjoyed to have me going home with them. Mother would be glad, they\nsaid. I felt it, though I did not say so.\n\nHow soundly I slept that night at the inn on the road! A little after\nsunset, on the third day, for we traveled slowly, we reached the woods\nwhich bordered Surrey, and soon came in sight of the sea encircling it\nlike a crescent moon. It was as if I saw the sea for the first time.\nA vague sense of its power surprised me; it seemed to express my\nmelancholy. As we approached the house, the orchard, and I saw\nVeronica's window, other feelings moved me. Not because I saw familiar\nobjects, nor because I was going home--it was the relation in which\n_I_ stood to them, that I felt. We drove through the gate, and saw\na handsome little boy astride a window-sill, with two pipes in his\nmouth, \"Papa!\" he shrieked, threw his pipes down, and dropped on the\nground, to run after us.\n\n\"Hasn't Arthur grown?\" Aunt Merce asked. \"He is almost seven.\"\n\n\"Almost seven? Where have the years gone?\"\n\nI looked about. I had been away so long, the house looked diminished.\nMother was in the door, crying when she put her arms round me; she\ncould not speak. I know now there should have been no higher beatitude\nthan to live in the presence of an unselfish, unasking, vital love. I\nonly said, \"Oh, mother, how gray your hair is! Are you glad to see me?\nI have grown old too!\"\n\nWe went in by the kitchen, where the men were, and a young girl with a\nbulging forehead. Hepsey looked out from the buttery door, and put\nher apron to her eyes, without making any further demonstration of\nwelcome. Temperance was mixing dough. She made an effort to giggle,\nbut failed; and as she could not cover her face with her doughy hands,\nwas obliged to let the tears run their natural course. Recovering\nherself in a moment, she exclaimed:\n\n\"Heavenly Powers, how you're altered! I shouldn't have known you. Your\nhair and skin are as dry as chips; they didn't wash you with Castile\nsoap, I'll bet.\"\n\n\"How you do talk, Temperance,\" Hepsey quavered.\n\nThe girl with the bulging forehead laughed a shrill laugh.\n\n\"Why, Fanny!\" said mother.\n\nThe hall door opened. \"Here _she_ is,\" muttered this Fanny.\n\n\"Veronica!\"\n\n\"Cassandra!\"\n\nWe grasped hands, and stared mutely at each other. I felt a\ncontraction in the region of my heart, as if a cord of steel were\nbinding it. She, at least, was glad that I was alive!\n\n\"They look something alike now,\" Hepsey remarked.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Veronica, dropping my hand, and retreating.\n\n\"Why, Arthur dear, come here!\"\n\nHe clambered into my lap.\n\n\"Were you killed, my dear sister?\"\n\n\"Not quite, little boy.\"\n\n\"Well; do you know that I am a veteran officer, and smoke my pipe,\nlots?\"\n\n\"You must rest, Cassy,\" said mother. \"Don't go upstairs, though, till\nyou have had your supper. Hurry it up, Temperance.\"\n\n\"It will be on the table in less than no time, Miss Morgeson,\" she\nanswered, \"provided Miss Fanny is agreeable about taking in the\nteapot.\"\n\nI had a comfortable sense of property, when I took possession of my\nown room. It was better, after all, to live with a father and mother,\nwho would adopt my ideas. Even the sea might be mine. I asked father\nthe next morning, at breakfast, how far out at sea his property\nextended.\n\n\"I trust, Cassandra, you will now stay at home,\" said mother; \"I am\ntired of table duty; you must pour the coffee and tea, for I wish to\nsit beside your father.\"\n\n\"You and Aunt Merce have settled down into a venerable condition. You\nwear caps, too! What a stage forward!\"\n\n\"The cap is not ugly, like Aunt Merce's; I made it,\" Veronica called,\nsipping from a great glass.\n\n\"Gothic pattern, isn't it?\" father asked, \"with a tower, and a bridge\nat the back of the neck?\"\n\n\"This hash is Fanny's work, mother,\" said Verry.\n\n\"So I perceive.\"\n\n\"Hepsey is not at the table,\" I said.\n\n\"It is her idea not to come, since I have taken Fanny. Did you notice\nher? She prefers to have her wait.\"\n\n\"Who is Fanny?\"\n\n\"Her father is old Ichabod Bowles, who lives on the Neck. Last winter\nher mother sent for me, and begged me to take her. I could not refuse,\nfor she was dying of consumption; so I promised. The poor woman died,\nin the bitterest weather, and a few days after Ichabod brought Fanny\nhere, and told me he had done with womankind forever. Fanny was sulky\nand silent for a long time. I thought she never would get warm. If\nobliged to leave the fire, she sat against the wall, with her face hid\nin her arms. Veronica has made some impression on her; but she is not\na good girl.\"\n\n\"She will be, mother. I am better than I was.\"\n\n\"Never; her disposition is hateful. She is angry with those who are\nbetter off than herself. I have not seen a spark of gratitude in her.\"\n\n\"I never thought of gratitude,\" said Verry, \"it is true; but why must\npeople be grateful?\"\n\n\"We might expect little from Fanny, perhaps; she saw her mother die in\nwant, her father stern, almost cruel to them, and soured by poverty.\nFanny never had what she liked to eat or wear, till she came here,\nor even saw anything that pleased her; and the contrast makes her\nbitter.\"\n\n\"She is proud, too,\" said Aunt Merce. \"I hear her boasting of what she\nwould have had if she had stayed at home.\"\n\n\"She is a child, you know,\" said Verry.\n\n\"A year younger than you are.\"\n\n\"Where is the universal boy?\"\n\n\"Abolished,\" father answered. \"Arthur is growing into that estate.\"\n\n\"Papa, don't forget that I am a veteran officer.\"\n\n\"Here, you rascal, come and get this nice egg.\"\n\nHe slipped down, went to his father, who took him on his knee.\n\n\"What shall I do first? the garden, orchard, village, or what?\" I\nasked.\n\n\"Gardens?\" said Verry. \"Have they been a part of your education?\"\n\n\"I like flowers.\"\n\n\"Have you seen my plants?\" Aunt Merce inquired.\n\n\"I will look at them. How different this is from Rosville?\"\n\nThen a pang cut me to the soul. The past whirled up, to disappear,\nleaving me stunned and helpless. Veronica's eye was upon me. I forced\nmyself to observe her. The difference between us was plainer than\never. I was in my twentieth year, she was barely sixteen; handsome,\nand as peculiar-looking as when a child. Her straight hair was a vivid\nchestnut color. Her large eyes were near together; and, as Ben Somers\nsaid, the most singular eyes that were ever upon earth. They tormented\nme. There was nothing willful in them; on the contrary, when she\nwas willful, she had no power over them; the strange cast was then\nperceptible. Neither were they imperious nor magnetic; they were\n_baffling_. She pushed her chair from the table, and stood by me\nquiet. Tall and slender, she stooped slightly, as if she were not\nstrong enough to stand upright. Her dress was a buff-colored cambric,\ntrimmed with knots of ribbon of the same color, dotted with green\ncrosses. It harmonized with her colorless, fixedly pale complexion.\nI counted the bows of ribbon on her dress, and would have counted the\ncrosses, if she had not interrupted me with, \"What do you think of\nme?\"\n\n\"Do you ever blush, Verry?\"\n\n\"I grow paler, you know, when I blush.\"\n\n\"What do you think of me?\"\n\n\"As wide-eyed as ever, and your eyebrows as black. Who ever saw light,\nripply hair with such eyebrows? I see wrinkles, too.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Round your eyes, like an opening umbrella.\"\n\nWe dispersed as our talk ended, in the old fashion. I followed\nAunt Merce to the flower-stand, which stood in its old place on the\nlanding.\n\n\"I have a poor lot of roses,\" she said, \"but some splendid cactuses.\"\n\n\"I do not love roses.\"\n\n\"Is it possible? But Verry does not care so much for them, either.\nLilies are her favorites; she has a variety. Look at this Arab lily;\nit is like a tongue of fire.\"\n\n\"Where does she keep her flowers?\"\n\n\"In wire baskets, in her room. But I must go to make Arthur some\ngingerbread. He likes mine the best, and I like to please him.\"\n\n\"I dare say you spoil him.\"\n\n\"Just as you were spoiled.\"\n\n\"Not in Barmouth, Aunt Merce.\"\n\n\"No, not in Barmouth, Cassy.\"\n\nI went from room to room, seeing little to interest me. My zeal oozed\naway for exploration, and when I entered my chamber I could have said,\n\"This spot is the summary of my wants, for it contains me.\" I must\nbe my own society, and as my society was not agreeable, the more\ncircumscribed it was, the better I could endure it. What a dreary\nprospect! The past was vital, the present dead! Life in Surrey must be\ndull. How could I forget or enjoy? I put the curtains down, and told\nTemperance, who was wandering about, not to call me to dinner. I\ndetermined, if possible, to surpass my dullness by indulgence. But\nunderneath it all I could not deny that there was a specter, whose\naimless movements kept me from stagnating. I determined to drag it up\nand face it.\n\n\"Come,\" I called, \"and stand before me; we will reason together.\"\n\nIt uncovered, and asked:\n\n\"Do you feel remorse and repentance?\"\n\n\"Neither!\"\n\n\"Why suffer then?\"\n\n\"I do not know why.\"\n\n\"You confess ignorance. Can you confess that you are selfish,\nself-seeking--devilish?\"\n\n\"Are you my devil?\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"Am I cowardly, or a liar?\"\n\nIt laughed, a faint, sarcastic laugh.\n\n\"At all events,\" I continued, \"are not my actions better than my\nthoughts?\"\n\n\"Which makes the sinner, and which the saint?\"\n\n\"Can I decide?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"My teachers and myself are so far apart! I have found a counterpart;\nbut, specter, you were born of the union.\"\n\nMy head was buried in my arms; but I heard a voice at my elbow--a\nshrill, scornful voice it was. \"Are you coming down to tea, then?\"\n\nLooking up, I saw Fanny. \"Tea-time so soon?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is. You think nothing of time; have nothing to do, I\nsuppose.\"\n\nAnd she clasped her hands over her apron--hands so small and thin that\nthey looked like those of an old woman. Her hair was light and scanty,\nher complexion sallow, and her eyes a palish gray; but her features\nwere delicate and pretty. She seemed to understand my thoughts.\n\n\"You think I am stunted, don't you?\"\n\n\"You are not large to my eye.\"\n\n\"Suppose you had been fed mostly on Indian meal, with a herring or a\npiece of salted pork for a relish, and clams or tautog for a luxury,\nas I have been, would you be as tall and as grand-looking as you are\nnow? And would you be covering up your face, making believe worry?\"\n\n\"May be not. You may tell mother that I am coming.\"\n\n\"I shall not say 'Miss Morgeson,' but 'Cassandra.' 'Cassandra\nMorgeson,' if I like.\"\n\n\"Call me what you please, only tone down that voice of yours; it is\nsharper than the east wind.\"\n\nI heard her beating a tattoo on Veronica's door next. She had been\ntaught to be ceremonious with her, at least. No reply was made, and\nshe came to my door again. \"I expect Miss Veronica has gone to see\npoor folks; it is a way _she_ has,\" and spitefully closed it.\n\nAfter tea mother came up to inquire the reason of my seclusion. My\nexcuse of fatigue she readily accepted, for she thought I still looked\nill. I had changed so much, she said, it made her heart ache to look\nat me. When I could speak of the accident at Rosville, would I tell\nher all? And would I describe my life there; what friends I had made;\nwould they visit me? She hoped so. And Mr. Somers, who made them so\nhurried a visit, would he come? She liked him. While she talked, she\nkept a pitying but resolute eye upon me.\n\n\"Dear mother, I never can tell you all, as you wish. It is hard\nenough for me to bear my thoughts, without the additional one that my\nfeelings are understood and speculated upon. If I should tell you, the\nbarrier between me and self-control would give way. You will see Alice\nMorgeson, and if she chooses she can tell you what my life was in her\nhouse. She knows it well.\"\n\n\"Cassandra, what does your bitter face and voice mean?\"\n\n\"I mean, mother, all your woman's heart might guess, if you were not\nso pure, so single-hearted.\"\n\n\"No, no, no.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then I understand the riddle you have been, one to bring a curse.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to curse, mother; our experiences are not foretold\nby law. We may be righteous by rule, we do not sin that way. There was\nno beginning, no end, to mine.\"\n\n\"Should women curse themselves, then, for giving birth to daughters?\"\n\n\"Wait, mother; what is bad this year may be good the next. You blame\nyourself, because you believe your ignorance has brought me into\ndanger. Wait, mother.\"\n\n\"You are beyond me; everything is beyond.\"\n\n\"I will be a good girl. Kiss me, mother. I have been unworthy of you.\nWhen have I ever done anything for you? If you hadn't been my mother,\nI dare say we might have helped each other, my friendship and sympathy\nhave sustained you. As it is, I have behaved as all young animals\nbehave to their mothers. One thing you may be sure of. The doubt\nyou feel is needless. You must neither pray nor weep over me. Have I\nagitated you?\"\n\n\"My heart _will_ flutter too much, anyway. Oh, Cassy, Cassy, why\nare you such a girl? Why will you be so awfully headstrong?\" But she\nhugged and kissed me. As I felt the irregular beating of her heart,\na pain smote me. What if she should not live long? Was I not a wicked\nfool to lacerate myself with an intangible trouble--the reflex of\nselfish emotions?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n\nVeronica's room was like no other place. I was in a new atmosphere\nthere. A green carpet covered the floor, and the windows had light\nblue silk curtains.\n\n\"Green and blue together, Veronica?\"\n\n\"Why not? The sky is blue, and the carpet of the earth is green.\"\n\n\"If you intend to represent the heavens and the earth here, it is very\nwell.\"\n\nThe paper on the wall was ash-colored, with penciled lines. She had\ncloudy days probably. A large-eyed Saint Cecilia, with white roses in\nher hair, was pasted on the wall. This frameless picture had a curious\neffect. Veronica, in some mysterious way, had contrived to dispose\nof the white margin of the picture, and the saint looked out from the\nsoft ashy tint of the wallpaper. Opposite was an exquisite engraving,\nwhich was framed with dark red velvet. At the end of an avenue of\nold trees, gnarled and twisted into each other, a man stood. One hand\ngrasped the stalk of a ragged vine, which ran over the tree near him;\nthe other hung helpless by his side, as if the wrist was broken. His\neyes were fixed on some object behind the trees, where nothing was\nvisible but a portion of the wall of a house. His expression of\nconcentrated fury--his attitude of waiting--testified that he would\nsurely accomplish his intention.\n\n\"What a picture!\"\n\n\"The foliage attracted me, and I bought it; but when I unpacked it,\nthe man seemed to come out for the first time. Will you take it?\"\n\n\"No; I mean to give my room a somnolent aspect. The man is too\nterribly sleepless.\"\n\nA table stood near the window, methodically covered with labelled\nblank-books, a morocco portfolio, and a Wedgewood inkstand and vase.\nIn an arch, which she had manufactured from the space under the garret\nstairs, stood her bed. At its foot, against the wall, a bunch of\ncrimson autumn leaves was fastened, and a bough, black and bare, with\nan empty nest on it.\n\n\"Where is the feminine portion of your furnishing?\"\n\n\"Look in the closet.\"\n\nI opened a door. What had formerly been appropriated by mother to\nblankets and comfortables, she had turned into a magazine of toilet\narticles. There were drawers and boxes for everything which pertained\nto a wardrobe, arranged with beautiful skill and neatness. She\ndirected my attention to her books, on hanging shelves, within reach\nof the bed. Beneath them was a small stand, with a wax candle in a\nsilver candlestick.\n\n\"You read o' nights?\"\n\n\"Yes; and the wax candle is my pet weakness.\"\n\n\"Have you put away Gray, and Pope, and Thomson?\"\n\n\"The Arabian Nights and the Bible are still there. Mother thought you\nwould like to refurnish your room. It is the same as when we moved,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"Did she? I will have it done. Good-by.\"\n\n\"Good-by.\"\n\nShe was at the window now, and had opened a pane.\n\n\"What's that you are doing?\"\n\n\"Looking through my wicket.\"\n\nI went back again to understand the wicket. It had been made, she\nsaid, so that she might have fresh air in all weathers, without\nraising the windows. In the night she could look out without danger of\ntaking cold. We looked over the autumn fields; the crows were flying\nseaward over the stubble, or settling in the branches of an old fir,\nstanding alone, midway between the woods and the orchard. The ground\nbefore us, rising so gradually, and shortening the horizon, reminded\nme of my childish notion that we were near the North Pole, and that\nif we could get behind the low rim of sky we should be in the Arctic\nZone.\n\n\"The Northern Lights have not deserted us, Veronica?\"\n\n\"No; they beckon me over there, in winter.\"\n\n\"Do you never tire of this limited, monotonous view--of a few uneven\nfields, squared by grim stone walls?\"\n\n\"That is not all. See those eternal travelers, the clouds, that hurry\nup from some mysterious region to go over your way, where I never\nlook. If the landscape were wider, I could never learn it. And the\norchard--have you noticed that? There are bird and butterfly lives\nin it, every year. Why, morning and night are wonderful from these\nwindows. But I must say the charm vanishes if I go from them. Surrey\nis not lovely.\" She closed the wicket, and sat down by the table. My\ndullness vanished with her. There might be something to interest me\nbeneath the calm surface of our family life after all.\n\n\"Veronica, do you think mother is changed? I think so.\"\n\n\"She is always the same to me. But I have had fears respecting her\nhealth.\"\n\nOutside the door I met Temperance, with a clothes-basket.\n\n\"Oh ho!\" she said, \"you are going the rounds. Verry's room beats all\npossessed, don't it? It is cleaned spick and span every three months.\nShe calls it inaugurating the seasons. She is as queer as Dick's\nhatband. Have you any fine things to do up?\"\n\nHer question put me in mind of my trunks, and I hastened to them, with\nthe determination of putting my room to rights. The call to dinner\ninterrupted me before I had begun, and the call to supper came before\nanything in the way of improvement had been accomplished. My mind\nwas chaotic by bed-time. The picture of Veronica, reading by her wax\ncandle, or looking through the wicket, collected and happy in her\norderly perfection, came into my mind, and with it an admiration which\nnever ceased, though I had no sympathy with her. We seemed as far\napart as when we were children.\n\nI was eager for employment, promising to perform many tasks, but the\nattempt killed my purpose and interest. My will was nerveless, when I\ncontemplated Time, which stretched before me--a vague, limitless sea;\nand I only kept Endeavor in view, near enough to be tormented.\n\nOne day father asked me to go to Milford, and I then asked him for\nmoney to spend for the adornment of my room.\n\n\"Be prudent,\" he replied. \"I am not so rich as people think me.\nAlthough the _Locke Morgeson_ was insured, she was a loss. But you\nneed not speak of this to your mother. I never worry her with my\nbusiness cares. As for Veronica, she has not the least idea of the\nvalue of money, or care for what it represents.\"\n\nWhen we went into the shops, I found him disposed to be more\nextravagant than I was. I bought a blue and white carpet; a piece\nof blue and white flowered chintz; two stuffed chairs, covered with\nhair-cloth (father remonstrated against these), and a long mirror to\ngo between the windows, astonishing him with my vanity. What I wanted\nbesides I could construct myself, with the help of the cabinet maker\nin Surrey.\n\nIn one of the shops I heard a familiar voice, which gave me a thrill\nof anger. I turned and saw Charlotte Alden, of Barmouth, the girl who\nhad given me the fall on the tilt. She could not control an expression\nof surprise at the sight of the well-dressed woman before her. It was\nmy dress that astonished her. Where could _I_ have obtained style?\n\n\"Miss Alden, how do you do? Pray tell me whether you have collected\nany correct legends respecting my mother's early history. And do you\ntilt off little girls nowadays?\"\n\nShe made no reply, and I left her standing where she was when I began\nspeaking. When we got out of town, my anger cooled, and I grew ashamed\nof my spitefulness, and by way of penance I related the affair to\nfather. He laughed at what I said to her, and told me that he had long\nknown her family. Charlotte's uncle had paid his addresses to mother.\nThere might have been an engagement; whether there was or not, the\ninfluence of his family had broken the acquaintance. This explained\nwhat Charlotte said to me in Miss Black's school about mother's being\nin love.\n\n\"You might have been angry with the girl, but you should not have felt\nhurt at the fact implied. Are you so young still as to believe that\nonly those who love marry? or that those who marry have never loved,\nexcept each other?\"\n\n\"I have thought of these things; but I am afraid that Love, like\nTheology, if examined, makes one skeptical.\"\n\nWe jogged along in silence for a mile or two.\n\n\"Whether every man's children overpower him, I wonder? I am positively\nafraid of you and Veronica.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I am always unprepared for the demonstrations of character you and\nshe make. My traditional estimate, which comes from thoughtfulness, or\nthe putting off of responsibility, or God knows what, I find will not\nanswer. I have been on my guard against that which everyday life might\npresent--a lie, a theft, or a meanness; but of the undercurrent, which\nreally bears you on, I have known nothing.\"\n\n\"If you happen to dive below the surface, and find the roots of our\nactions which are fixed beneath its tide--what then? Must you lament\nover us?\"\n\n\"No, no; but this is vague talk.\"\n\nWas he dissatisfied with me? What could he expect? We all went our\nseparate ways, it is true; was it that? Perhaps he felt alone. I\nstudied his face; it was not so cheerful as I remembered it once, but\nstill open, honest, and wholesome. I promised myself to observe his\ntastes and consult them. It might be that his self-love had never been\nencouraged. But I failed in that design, as in all others.\n\n\"Much of my time is consumed in passing between Milford and Surrey,\nyou perceive.\"\n\n\"I will go with you often.\"\n\nAccording to habit, on arriving, I went into the kitchen. It was dusk\nthere, and still. Temperance was by the fire, attending to something\nwhich was cooking.\n\n\"What is there for supper, Temperance? I am hungry.\"\n\n\"I spose you are,\" she answered crossly. \"You'll see when it's on the\ntable.\"\n\nShe took a coal of fire with the tongs, and blew it fiercely, to\nlight a lamp by. When it was alight, she set it on the chimney-shelf,\nrevealing thereby a man at the back of the room, balancing his chair\non two legs against the wail; his feet were on its highest round, and\nhe twirled his thumbs.\n\n\"Hum,\" he said, when he saw me observing him; \"this is the oldest\ndarter, is it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Temperance bawled.\n\n\"She is a good solid gal; but I can't recollect her christened name.\"\n\n\"It is Cassandra.\"\n\n\"Why, 'taint Scriptur'.\"\n\n\"Why don't you go and take off your things?\" Temperance asked,\nabruptly.\n\n\"I'll leave them here; the fire is agreeable.\"\n\n\"There is a better fire in the keeping-room.\"\n\n\"How are you, Mr. Handy?\" father inquired, coming in.\n\n\"I should be well, if my grinders didn't trouble me; they play the\nmischief o'nights. Have you heard from the _Adamant_, Mr. Morgeson?\nI should like to get my poor boy's chist. The Lord ha' mercy on him,\nwhose bones are in the caverns of the deep.\"\n\n\"Now, Abram, do shut up. Tea is ready, Mr. Morgeson. I'll bring in the\nham directly,\" said Temperance.\n\nThere was no news from the _Adamant_. I lingered in the hope of\ndiscovering why Mr. Handy irritated Temperance. He was a man of sixty,\nwith a round head, and a large, tender wart on one cheek; the two\ntusks under his upper lip suggested a walrus. Though he was no beauty,\nhe looked thoroughly respectable, in garments whose primal colors\nhad disappeared, and blue woolen stockings gartered to a miracle of\ntightness.\n\n\"Temperance,\" he said, \"my quinces have done fust rate this year. I\nhaint pulled 'em yet; but I've counted them over and over agin. But my\npig wont weigh nothin' like what I calkerlated on. Sarved me right. I\nneedn't have bought him out of a drove; if Charity had been alive, I\nshouldn't ha' done it. A man can't--I say, Tempy--a man _can't_ git\nalong while here below, without a woman.\"\n\nShe gave my arm a severe pinch as she passed with the ham, and I\nthought it best to follow her. Mother looked at her with a smile, and\nsaid: \"Deal gently with Brother Abram, Temperance.\"\n\n\"Brother be fiddlesticked!\" she said tartly. \"Miss Morgeson, _do_ you\nwant some quinces?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"We'll make hard marmalade this year, then. You shall have the quinces\nto-morrow.\" And she retired with a softened face. I was told that\nAbram Handy was a widower anxious to take Temperance for a second\nhelpmeet, and that she could not decide whether to accept or refuse\nhim. She had confessed to mother that she was on the fence, and didn't\nknow which way to jump. He was a poor, witless thing, she knew; but\nhe was as good a man as ever breathed, and stood as good a chance\nof being saved as the wisest church-member that ever lived! Mother\nthought her inclined to be mistress of an establishment over which she\nmight have sole control. Abram owned a house, a garden, and kept pigs,\nhens, and a cow; these were his themes of conversation. Mother could\nnot help thinking he was influenced by Temperance's fortune. She was\nworth two thousand dollars, at least. The care of her wood-lot,\nthe cutting, selling, or burning the wood on it, would be a supreme\nhappiness to Abram, who loved property next to the kingdom of heaven.\nThe tragedy of the old man's life was the loss of his only son, who\nhad been killed by a whale a year since. The _Adamant_, the ship he\nsailed in, had not returned, and it was a consoling hope with Abram\nthat his boy's chist might come back.\n\n\"We heard of poor Charming Handy's death the tenth of September, about\nthree months after Abram began his visits to Temperance,\" Veronica\nsaid.\n\n\"Was his name Charming?\" I asked.\n\n\"His mother named him,\" Abram said, \"with a name that she had picked\nout of Novel's works, which she was forever and 'tarnally reading.\"\n\n\"What day of the month is it, Verry?\"\n\n\"Third of October.\"\n\n\"What happened a year ago to-day?\"\n\n\"Arthur fell off the roof of the wood-house.\"\n\n\"Verry,\" he cried, \"you needn't tell my sister of that; now she knows\nabout my scar. You tell everything; she does not. You have scars,\" he\nwhispered to me; \"they look red sometimes. May I put my finger on your\ncheek?\"\n\nI took his hand, and rubbed his fingers over the cuts; they were not\ndeep, but they would never go away.\n\n\"I wish mine were as nice; it is only a little hole under my hair.\nSoldiers ought to have long scars, made with great big swords, and I\nam a soldier, ain't I, Cassy?\"\n\n\"Have I heard you sing, Cassy?\" asked father. \"Come, let us have some\nmusic.\"\n\n\"'And the cares which infest the day,'\" added Verry.\n\nI had scarcely been in the parlor since my return, though the fact had\nnot been noticed. Our tacit compact was that we should be ignorant of\neach other's movements. I ran up to my room for some music, and, not\nhaving a lamp, stumbled over my shawl and bonnet and various bundles\nwhich somebody had deposited on the floor. I went down by the back\nway, to the kitchen; Fanny was there alone, standing before the fire,\nand whistling a sharp air.\n\n\"Did you carry my bonnet and shawl upstairs?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Will you be good enough to take this music to the parlor for me?\"\n\nShe turned and put her hands behind her. \"Who was your waiter last\nyear?\"\n\n\"I had one,\" putting the leaves under her arm; they fluttered to the\nfloor, one by one.\n\n\"You must pick them up, or we shall spend the night here, and father\nis waiting for me.\"\n\n\"Is he?\" and she began to take them up.\n\n\"I am quite sure, Fanny, that I could punish you awfully. I am sick to\ntry.\"\n\nShe moved toward the door slowly. \"Don't tell him,\" she said, stopping\nbefore it.\n\n\"I'll tell nobody, but I am angry. Let us arrive.\"\n\nShe marched to the piano, laid the music on it, and marched out.\n\n\"By the way, Fanny,\" I whispered, \"the bonnet and shawl are yours, if\nyou need them.\"\n\n\"I guess I do,\" she whispered back.\n\nWhen I returned to my room, I found it in order and the bundles\nremoved.\n\nOne day some Surrey friends called. They told me I had changed very\nmuch, and I inferred from their tone they did not consider the change\none for the better.\n\n\"How much Veronica has improved,\" they continued, \"do not you think\nso?\"\n\n\"You know,\" she interrupted, \"that Cassandra has been dangerously ill,\nand has barely recovered.\"\n\nYes, they had heard of the accident, everybody had; Mr. Morgeson must\nbe a loss to his family, a man in the prime of life, too.\n\n\"The prime of life,\" Veronica repeated.\n\nShe was asked to play, and immediately went to the piano. Strange\ngirl; her music was so filled with a wild lament that I again fathomed\nmy desires and my despair. Her eyes wandered toward me, burning with\nthe fires of her creative power, not with the feelings which stung\nme to the quick. Her face was calm, white, and fixed. She stopped and\ntouched her eyelids, as if she were weeping, but there were no tears\nin her eyes. They were in mine, welling painfully beneath the lids. I\nturned over the music books to hide them.\n\n\"That is a singular piece,\" said one. \"Now, Cassandra, will you favor\nus? We expect to find you highly accomplished.\"\n\n\"I sang myself out before you came in.\"\n\nIn the bustle of their going, Veronica stooped over my hand and kissed\nit, unseen. It was more like a sigh upon it than a kiss, but it swept\nthrough me, tingling the scars on my face, as if the flesh had become\nalive again.\n\n\"Take tea with us soon, do. We do not see you in the street or at\nchurch. It must be dull for you after coming from a boarding-school.\nStill, Surrey has its advantages.\" And the doors closed on them.\n\n\"Still, Surrey has its advantages,\" Veronica repeated.\n\n\"Yes, the air is sleepy; I am going to bed.\"\n\nI made resolutions before I slept that night, which I kept, for I\nsaid, \"Let the dead bury its dead.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n\nHelen's letters followed me. She had heard from Rosville all that had\nhappened, but did not expatiate on it. Her letters were full of minute\ndetails respecting her affairs. It was her way of diverting me from\nthe thoughts which she believed troubled me. \"L.N.\" was expected soon.\nSince his last letter, she had caught herself more than once making\ninventories of what she would like to have in the way of a wardrobe\nfor a particular occasion, which he had hinted at.\n\nI heard nothing from Alice, and was content that it should be so. Our\nacquaintance would be resumed in good time, I had no doubt. Neither\ndid I hear from Ben Somers. He very likely was investing in another\nplan. Of its result I should also hear.\n\nMy chief occupation was to drive with father. The wharves of Milford,\nthe doors of its banks and shipping offices, became familiar. I\nwitnessed bargains and contracts, and listened to talk of shipwrecks,\nmutinies, insurance cases, perjuries, failures, ruin, and rascalities.\nHis private opinions, and those who sought him, were kept in the\nbackground; the sole relation between them was--Traffic. Personality\nwas forgotten in the absorbed attention which was given to business.\nThey appeared to me, though, as if pursuing something beyond Gain,\nwhich should narcotize or stimulate them to forget that man's life was\na vain going to and fro.\n\nMother reproached father for allowing me to adopt the habits of a man.\nHe thought it a wholesome change; besides, it would not last. While\nI was his companion there were moments when he left his ledger for\nanother book.\n\n\"You never call yourself a gambler, do you, Locke?\" mother asked.\n\"Strange, too, that you think of Cassy in your business life instead\nof me.\"\n\n\"Mary, could I break your settled habits. Cassy is afloat yet. I can\nguide her hither and yon. Moreover, with her, I dream of youth.\"\n\n\"Is youth so happy?\" we both asked.\n\n\"We think so, when we see it in others.\"\n\n\"Not all of us,\" she said. \"You think Cassandra has no ways of her\nown! She can make us change ours; do you know that?\"\n\n\"May be.\"\n\nA habit grew upon me of consulting the sea as soon as I rose in the\nmorning. Its aspect decided how my day would be spent. I watched it,\nstudying its changes, seeking to understand its effect, ever attracted\nby an awful materiality and its easy power to drown me. By the shore\nat night the vague tumultuous sphere, swayed by an influence mightier\nthan itself, gave voice, which drew my soul to utter speech for\nspeech. I went there by day unobserved, except by our people, for I\nnever walked toward the village. Mother descried me, as she would a\ndistant sail, or Aunt Merce, who had a vacant habit of looking from\nall the windows a moment at a time, as if she were forever expecting\nthe arrival of somebody who never came. Arthur, too, saw me, as he\nplayed among the rocks, waded, caught crabs and little fish, like all\nboys whose hereditary associations are amphibious. But Veronica never\ncame to the windows on that side of the house, unless a ship was\narriving from a long voyage. Then her interest was in the ship alone,\nto see whether her colors were half-mast, or if she were battered and\ntorn, recalling to mind those who had died or married since the ship\nsailed from port; for she knew the names of all who ever left Surrey,\nand their family relations.\n\nWeeks passed before I had completed the furnishing of my room; I\nhad been to Helen's wedding, and had returned, and it was still in\nprogress. The ground was covered with snow. The sea was dark and rough\nunder the frequent north wind, sometimes gray and silent in an icy\natmosphere; sometimes blue and shining beneath the pale winter sun.\nThe day when the room was ready, Fanny made a wood fire, which burned\nmerrily, and encouraged the new chairs, tables, carpet, and curtains\ninto a friendly assimilation; they met and danced on the round tops\nof the brass dogs. It already seemed to me that I was like the room.\nUnlike Veronica, I had nothing odd, nothing suggestive. My curtains\nwere blue chintz, and the sofa and chairs were covered with the\nsame; the ascetic aspect of my two hair-cloth arm-chairs was entirely\nconcealed. The walls were painted amber color, and varnished. There\nwere no pictures but the shining shadows. A row of shelves covered\nwith blue damask was on one side, and my tall mirror on the other. The\ndoors were likewise covered with blue damask, nailed round with brass\nnails. When I had nothing else to do I counted the nails. The wooden\nmantel shelf, originally painted in imitation of black marble, I\ncovered with damask, and fringed it. I sent Fanny down for mother and\nAunt Merce. They declared, at once, they were stifled; too many things\nin the room; too warm; too dark; the fringe on the mantel would catch\nfire and burn me up; too much trouble to take care of it. What was\nunder the carpet that made it so soft and the steps so noiseless? How\nnice it was! Temperance, who had been my aid, arrived at this juncture\nand croaked.\n\n\"Did you ever see such a stived-up hole, Mis Morgeson?\"\n\n\"I like it now,\" she answered, \"it is so comfortable. How lovely this\nblue is!\"\n\n\"It's a pity she wont keep the blinds shut. The curtains will fade to\nrags in no time; the sun pours on 'em.\"\n\n\"How could I watch the sea then?\" I asked.\n\n\"Good Lord! it's a mystery to me how you can bother over that salt\nwater.\"\n\n\"And the smell of the sea-weed,\" added Aunt Merce.\n\n\"And its thousand dreary cries,\" said mother.\n\n\"Do you like my covered doors?\" I inquired.\n\n\"I vow,\" Temperance exclaimed, \"the nails are put in crooked! And I\nstood over Dexter the whole time. He said it was damned nonsense, and\nthat you must be awfully spoiled to want such a thing. 'You get your\npay, Dexter,' says I, 'for what you do, don't you?' 'I guess I do,'\nsays he, and then he winked. 'None of your gab,' says I. I do believe\nthat man is a cheat and a rascal, I vow I do. But they are all so.\"\n\n\"In my young days,\" Aunt Merce remarked, \"young girls were not allowed\nto have fires in their chambers.\"\n\n\"In our young days, Mercy,\" mother replied, \"_we_ were not allowed to\nhave much of anything.\"\n\n\"Fires are not wholesome to sleep by,\" Temperance added.\n\n\"Miss Veronica never has a fire,\" piped Fanny, who had remained,\noccasionally making a stir with the tongs.\n\n\"But she ought to have!\" Temperance exclaimed vehemently. \"I do\nwonder, Mis Morgeson, that you do not insist upon it, though it's none\nof my business.\"\n\nFather was conducted upstairs, after supper. The fire was freshly\nmade; the shaded lamp on the table before the sofa and the easy-chair\npleased him. He came often afterward, and stayed so long, sometimes,\nthat I fell asleep, and found him there, when I woke, still smoking\nand watching the fire.\n\nVeronica looked in at bed-time. \"I recognize you here,\" she said as\nshe passed. But she came back in a few moments in a wrapper, with a\ncomb in her hand, and stood on the hearth combing her hair, which was\nlonger than a mermaid's. The fire was grateful to her, and I believe\nthat she was surprised at the fact.\n\n\"Why not have a fire in your room, Verry?\"\n\n\"A fire would put me out. One belongs in this room, though. It is the\nonly reality here.\"\n\n\"What if I should say you provoke me, perverse girl?\"\n\n\"What if you should?\"\n\nShe gathered up her hair and shook it round her face, with the same\nelfish look she wore when she pulled it over her eyes as a child. It\nmade me feel how much older I was.\n\n\"I do not say so, and I will not.\"\n\n\"I wish you would; I should like to hear something natural from you.\"\n\nFanny, coming in with an armful of wood, heard her. Instead of putting\nit on the fire, she laid it on the hearth, and, sitting upon it with\nan expression of enjoyment, looked at both of us with an expectant\nair.\n\n\"You love mischief, Fanny,\" I said.\n\n\"Is it mischief for me to look at sisters that don't love each other?\"\nand, laughing shrilly, she pulled a stick from under her, and threw it\non the fire.\n\nVeronica's eyes shot more sparks than the disturbed coals, for Fanny's\nspeech enraged her. Giving her head a toss, which swept her hair\nbehind her shoulders, she darted at Fanny, and picked her up from the\nwood, with as much ease as if it had been her handkerchief, instead of\na girl nearly as heavy as herself. I started up.\n\n\"Sit still,\" she said to me, in her low, inflexible voice, holding\nFanny against the wall. \"I must attend to this little demon. Do you\ndare to think,\" addressing Fanny with a gentle vehemence, \"that what\nyou have just said, is true of _me_? Are you, with your small, starved\nspirit, equal to any judgment against _her?_ I admire her; you do,\ntoo. I _love_ her, and I love you, you pitiful, ignorant brat.\"\n\nHer strength gave way, and she let her go.\n\n\"All declarations in my behalf are made to third persons,\" I thought.\n\n\"I do believe, Miss Veronica,\" said Fanny, who did not express any\nastonishment or resentment at the treatment she had received, \"that\nyou are going to be sick; I feel so in my bones.\"\n\n\"Never mind your bones. Twist up my hair, and think, while you do it,\nhow to get rid of your diabolical curiosity.\"\n\n\"I have had nothing to do all my life,\" she answered, carefully\nknotting Verry's hair, \"but to be curious. I never found out much,\nthough, till lately\"; and she cast her eyes in my direction.\n\n\"Put her out, Cassandra,\" said Verry, \"if you like to touch her.\"\n\n\"I'll sweep the hearth, if you please, first,\" Fanny answered. \"I am a\ngood drudge, you know. Good-night, ladies.\"\n\nI followed Veronica, wishing to know if her room was uncomfortable.\nShe had made slight changes since my visit to her. The flowers had\nbeen moved, the stand where the candle stood was covered with crimson\ncloth. The dead bough and the autumn leaves were gone; but instead\nthere was a branch of waving grasses, green and fresh, and on the\ntable was a white flower, in a vase.\n\n\"It is freezing here, but it looks like summer. Is it design?\"\n\n\"Yes; I can't sit here much; still, I can read in bed, and write,\nespecially under my new quilt, which you have not seen.\"\n\nIt was composed of red, black, and blue bits of silk, and beautifully\nquilted. Hepsey and Temperance had made it for her.\n\n\"How about the wicket, these winter nights?\"\n\n\"I drag the quilt off, and wrap it round me when I want to look out.\"\n\nWe heard a bump on the floor, and Temperance appeared with warm bricks\nwrapped in flannel.\n\n\"You know that I will not have those things,\" Verry said.\n\n\"Dear me, how contrary you are! And you have not eaten a thing\nto-day.\"\n\n\"Carry them out.\"\n\nHer voice was so unyielding, but always so gentle! Temperance was\nobliged to deposit the bricks outside the door, which she did with a\nbang.\n\n\"I should think you might sleep in Cassandra's room; her bed is big\nenough for three.\"\n\nNo answer was made to this proposition, but Verry said,\n\n\"You may undress me, if you like, and stay till you are convinced I\nshall not freeze.\"\n\n\"I've staid till I am in an ager. I might as well finish the night\nhere, I spose.\"\n\nShe called me after midnight, for she had not left Verry, who had been\nattacked with one of her mysterious disorders.\n\n\"You can do nothing for her; but I am scared out, when she faints so\ndreadful; I don't like to be alone.\"\n\nVeronica could not speak, but she shook her head at me to go away.\nHer will seemed to be concentrated against losing consciousness; it\nslipped from her occasionally, and she made a rotary motion with\nher arms, which I attempted to stop, but her features contracted so\nterribly, I let her alone.\n\n\"Mustn't touch her,\" said Temperance, whose efforts to relieve her\nwere confined to replacing the coverings of the bed, and drawing her\nnightgown over her bosom, which she often threw off again. Her breath\nscarcely stirred her breast. I thought more than once she did not\nbreathe at all. Its delicate, virgin beauty touched me with a holy\npity. We sat by her bed in silence a long time, and although it was\nfreezing cold, did not suffer. Suddenly she turned her head and\nclosed her eyes. Temperance softly pulled up the clothes over her and\nwhispered: \"It is over for this time; but Lord, how awful it is! I\nhoped she was cured of these spells.\"\n\nIn a few minutes she asked, \"What time is it?\"\n\n\"It must be about eleven,\" Temperance replied; but it was nearly four.\nShe dozed again, but, opening her eyes presently, made a motion toward\nthe window.\n\n\"There's no help for it,\" muttered Temperance, \"she must go.\"\n\nI understood her, and put my arm under Verry's neck to raise her.\nTemperance wrapped the quilt round her, and we carried her to the\nwindow. Temperance pushed open the pane; an icy wind blew against us.\n\n\"It is the winter that kills little Verry,\" she said, in a childlike\nvoice. \"God's breath is cold over the world, and my life goes. But the\nspring is coming; it will come back.\"\n\nI looked at Temperance, whose face was so corrugated with the desire\nfor crying and the effort to keep from it, that for the life of me,\nI could not help smiling. As soon as I smiled I laughed, and then\nTemperance gave way to crying and laughing together. Veronica stared,\nand realized the circumstances in a second. She walked back to the\nbed, laughing faintly, too. \"Go to bed, do. You have been here a long\ntime, have you?\"\n\nI left Temperance tucking the clothes about her, kissing her, and\ncalling her \"deary and her best child.\"\n\nI could not go to bed at once, for Fanny was on my hearth before the\nfire, which she had rekindled, watching the boiling of something.\n\n\"She has come to, hasn't she?\" stirring the contents of the kettle. \"I\nknew it was going to be so with her, she was so mad with me. She is\nlike the Old Harry before she has a turn, and like an angel after.\nI am fond of people who have their ups and downs. I have seen her so\nbefore. She asked me to keep the doors locked once; they are locked\nnow. But I couldn't keep _you_ out. The doctor said she must have warm\ndrinks as soon as she was better. This is gruel.\"\n\n\"If it is done, away with you. Calamity improves you, don't it? You\nseem in excellent spirits.\"\n\n\"First-rate; I can be somebody then.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n\nBefore spring there were three public events in Surrey. A lighthouse\nwas built on Gloster Point, below our house. At night there was a\nbridge of red, tremulous light between my window and its tower, which\nseemed to shorten the distance. A town-clock had been placed in the\nbelfry of the new church in the western part of the village. Veronica\ncould see the tips of its gilded hands from the top of her window, and\nhear it strike through the night, whether the wind was fair to bring\nthe sound or not. She liked to hear the hours cry that they had gone.\nSoon after the clock was up, she recollected that Mrs. Crossman's\ndog had ceased to bark at night, as was his wont, and sent her a note\ninquiring about it, for she thought there was something poetical in\nconnection with nocturnal noises, which she hoped Mrs. Crossman felt\nalso. Fanny conveyed the note, and read it likewise, as Mrs. Crossman\ndeclared her inability to read writing with her new spectacles, which\na peddler had cheated her with lately. She laughed at it, and sent\nword to Veronica that she was the curiousest young woman for her age\nthat she had ever heard of; that the dog slept in the house of nights,\nfor he was blind and deaf now; but that Crossman should get a new dog\nwith a loud bark, if the dear child wanted it.\n\nA new dog soon came, so fierce that Abram told Temperance that people\nwere afraid to pass Crossman's. She guessed it wasn't the dog the\npeople were afraid of, but of their evil consciences, which pricked\nthem when they remembered Dr. Snell.\n\nThe third event was Mr. Thrasher's revival. It began in February, and\nbefore it was over, I heard the April frogs croaking in the marshy\nfield behind the church. We went to all the meetings, except Veronica,\nwho continued her custom of going only on Sunday afternoons. Mr.\nThrasher endeavored to proselyte me, but he never conversed with her.\nHis manner changed when he was at our house; if she appeared, the man\ntore away the mask of the minister. She called him a Bible-banger,\nthat he made the dust fly from the pulpit cushions too much to suit\nher; besides, he denounced sinners with vituperation, larding his\npiety with a grim wit which was distasteful. He was resentful toward\nme, especially after he had seen her. It was needful, he said, from my\ninfluence in Surrey, that I should become an example, and asked me\nif I did not think my escape from sudden death in Rosville was an\nindication from Providence that I was reserved for some especial work?\n\nSurrey was never so evangelical as under his ministration, and it\nremained so until he was called to a larger field of usefulness, and\noffered a higher salary to till it. We settled into a milder theocracy\nafter he left us. Mr. Park renewed his zeal, about this time, resuming\nhis discussions; but mother paid little attention to what he said.\nThere were days now when she was confined to her room. Sometimes I\nfound her softly praying. Once when I went there she was crying aloud,\nin a bitter voice, with her hands over her head. She was her old\nself when she recovered, except that she was indifferent to practical\ndetails. She sought amusement, indeed, liked to have me with her to\nmake her laugh, and Aunt Merce was always near to pet her as of old,\nand so we forgot those attacks.\n\nAbram Handy, inspired with religious fervor during the revival, was\nalso inspired with the twin passion--love--to visit Temperance, and\nbegged her, with so much eloquence, to marry him before his cow should\ncalve, that she consented, and he was happy. He spent the Sunday\nevenings with her, coming after conference meeting, hymn-book in hand.\nShe was angry and ashamed, if I happened to see them sitting in\nthe same chair, and singing, in a quavering voice, \"Greenland's Icy\nMountains,\" and continued morose for a week, in consequence.\n\n\"What will Veronica do without me?\" she said. \"I vow I wish Abram\nHandy would keep himself out of my way; who wants him?\"\n\n\"She will visit you, and so shall I.\"\n\n\"Certain true, will you, really?\"\n\n\"If you will promise to return our visits, and leave Abram at home,\nfor a week now and then.\"\n\n\"Done. I can mend your things and look after Mis Morgeson. Your mother\nis not the woman she was, and you and Veronica haven't a mite of\nfaculty. What you are all coming to is more than I can fathom.\"\n\n\"Who will fill your place?\"\n\n\"I don't want to brag, but you wont find a soul in Surrey to come here\nand live as I have lived. You will have to take a Paddy; the Paddies\nare spreading, the old housekeeping race is going. Hepsey and I are\nthe last of the Mohicans, and Hepsey is failing.\"\n\nShe was right, we never found her equal, and when she went, in May,\na Celtic dynasty came in. We missed her sadly. Verry refused to be\ncomforted. Symptoms of disorganization appeared everywhere.\n\nIn the summer Helen visited Surrey. Her enlivening gayety was the\nmeans of our uniting about her. She was never tired of Veronica's\nplaying, nor of our society; so we must stay where she and the\npiano were. We trimmed the parlor with flowers every day. Veronica\ntransferred some of her favorite books to the round table, and\nprivately sent for a set of flower vases. When they came, she said we\nmust have a new carpet to match them, and although mother protested\nagainst it, she was loud in her admiration when she saw the\nhandsome white Brussels, thickly covered with crimson roses. Helen's\nintroduction proved an astonishing incentive; we set a new value on\nourselves. I never saw so much of Veronica as at that time; her health\nimproved with her temper. She threw us into fits of laughter with her\nwhimsical talk, never laughing herself, but enjoying the effect she\nproduced. To please her, Helen changed her style of dress, and bought\na dress at Milford, which Veronica selected and made. The trying on\nof this dress was the means of her discovering the letters on Helen's\narm, which never ceased to be a source of interest. She asked to see\nthem every day afterward, and touched them with her fingers, as if\nthey had some occult power.\n\n\"You think her strange, do you not?\" I asked Helen.\n\n\"She has genius, but will be a child always.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken; she was always mature.\"\n\n\"She stopped in the process of maturity long ago. It is her genius\nwhich takes her on. You advance by experience.\"\n\n\"I shall learn nothing more.\"\n\n\"Of course you have suffered immensely, and endured that which\nisolates you from the rest of us.\"\n\n\"You are as wise as ever.\"\n\n\"Well, I am married, you know, and shall grow no wiser. Marriage puts\nan end to the wisdom of women; they need it no longer.\"\n\n\"You are nineteen years old?\"\n\n\"What is the use of talking to you? Besides, if we keep on we may tell\nsecrets that had better not be revealed. We might not like each\nother so well; friendship is apt to dull if there is no ground for\nspeculation left. Let us keep the bloom on the fruit, even if we know\nthere is a worm at the core.\"\n\nI owed it to her that I never had any confidante. My proclivities were\nfor speaking what I felt; but her strong common-sense influenced me\ngreatly against it; her teaching was the more easy to me, as she never\ninvaded my sentiments.\n\nHer visit was the occasion of our exchanging civilities with our\nacquaintances, which we neglected when alone. Tea parties were always\nfashionable in Surrey. Veronica went with us to one, given by our\ncousin, Susan Morgeson. She had taken tea out but twice, since she\nwas grown, she told us, then it was with her friend Lois Randall, a\nseamstress. To this girl she read the contents of her blank-books,\nand Lois in her turn confided to Veronica her own compositions. Essays\nwere her forte. We met her at Susan Morgeson's, and, as I never saw\nher without her having on some article given her by Veronica, this\noccasion was no exception. She wore an exquisitely embroidered purple\nsilk apron, over a dull blue dress. I saw Verry's grimace when her\neyes fell on it, and could not help saying, \"I hope Lois's essays are\nbetter than her taste in dress.\"\n\n\"She is an idiot in colors; but she admires what I wear so much that\nshe fancies the same must become her.\"\n\n\"As they become you?\"\n\n\"I make a study of dress--an anomaly must. It may be wicked, but what\ncan I do? I love to look well.\"\n\nThe dress she wore then was an India stuff, of linen, with a\ncream-colored ground, and a vivid yellow silk thread woven in stripes\nthrough it; each stripe had a cinnamon-colored edge. There were no\nornaments about her, except a band of violet-colored ribbon round her\nhead. When tea was brought in, she asked me in a whisper whether it\nwas tea or coffee in the cup which was given her.\n\n\"Why, Cass,\" said Helen, \"are you making a wonderment because she\ndoes not know? It is strange that you have not known that she drinks\nneither.\"\n\n\"What does she drink?\"\n\n\"Is it eccentric to drink milk?\" Verry asked, swallowing the tea with\nan accustomed air. \"I think this must be coffee, it stings my mouth\nso.\"\n\n\"It is green tea,\" said Helen; \"don't drink it, Verry.\"\n\n\"Green tea,\" she said, in a dreamy voice. \"We drank green tea ten\nyears ago, in our old house; and I did not know it! Cassandra, do\nyou remember that I drank four cups once, when mother had company? I\nlaughed all night, and Temperance cried.\"\n\nShe contributed her share toward entertaining, and invariably received\nthe most attention. My indifference was called pride, and her reserve\nwas called dignity, and dignity was more popular than pride.\n\nBefore Helen went, Ben wrote me that he was going to India. It was a\nfavorite journey with the Belemites. By the time the letter reached\nme he should be gone. Would I bear him in remembrance? He would not\nforget me, and promised me an Indian idol. In eighteen months he\nexpected to be at home again; sooner, perhaps. P.S. Would I give\nhis true regards to my sister? N.B. The property might be divided\naccording to his grandfather's will, before his return, and he wanted\nto be out of the way for sundry reasons, which he hoped to tell me\nsome day. I read the letter to Helen and Veronica. Helen laughed, and\nsaid \"Unstable as water\"; but Veronica looked displeased; she closed\nher eyes as if to recall him to mind, and asked Helen abruptly if she\ndid not like him.\n\n\"Yes; but I doubt him. With all his strength of character he has a\ncapacity for failure.\"\n\n\"I consider him a relation,\" I said.\n\n\"_I_ do not own him,\" said Veronica.\n\n\"At all events, he is not an affectionate one,\" Helen remarked. \"You\nhave not heard from him in a year.\"\n\n\"But I knew that I should hear,\" I said.\n\n\"We shall _see_ him,\" said Veronica, \"again.\"\n\nI was dull after I received his letter. My youth grew dim; somehow\nI felt a self-pity. I found no chance to embalm those phases of\nsensation which belonged to my period, and I grew careless; Helen's\ninfluence went with her. The observances so vital to Veronica, so\ncharming in her, I became utterly neglectful of. For all this a mad\nlonging sometimes seized me to depart into a new world, which should\ncontain no element of the old, least of all a reminiscence of what my\nexperience had made me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\n\nAlice Morgeson sent for Aunt Merce, asking her to fulfill the promise\nshe had made when she was in Rosville.\n\nWith misgivings she went, stayed a month, and returned with Alice. I\nfelt a throe of pain when we met, which she must have seen, for she\nturned pale, and the hand she had extended toward me fell by her side;\novercoming the impulse, she offered it again, but I did not take it. I\nhad no evidence to prove that she came to Surrey on my account; but I\nwas sure that such was the fact, as I was sure that there was a bond\nbetween us, which she did not choose to break, nor to acknowledge. She\nappeared as if expecting some explanation or revelation from me; but\nI gave her none, though I liked her better than ever. She was\nbusiness-like and observant. Her tendencies, never romantic, were less\nselfish; it was no longer society, dress, housekeeping, which absorbed\nher, but a larger interest in the world which gave her a desire\nto associate with men and women, independent of caste. None of her\nchildren were with her; had it been three years earlier, she would not\nhave left home without them. Her hair was a little gray, and a wrinkle\nor two had gathered about her mouth; but there was no other change.\nI was not sorry to have her go, for she paid me a close and quiet\nobservation. At the moment of departure, she said in an undertone:\n\"What has become of that candor of which you were so proud?\" \"I am\nmore candid than ever,\" I answered, \"for I am silent.\"\n\n\"I understand you better, now that I have seen you _en famille.\"_\n\n\"What do you think now?\"\n\n\"I don't think I know; the Puritans have much to answer for in\nyour mother--\" Turning to her she said, \"My children, too, are so\ndifferent.\"\n\nMother gave her a sad smile, as Fanny announced the carriage, and they\ndrove away.\n\n\"No more visitors this year,\" said Veronica, yawning.\n\n\"No agreeable ones, I fancy,\" I answered.\n\n\"All the relations have had their turn for this year,\" remarked Aunt\nMerce. But she was mistaken; an old lady came soon after this to spend\nthe winter. She lived but four miles from Surrey, but brought with her\nall her clothes, and a large green parrot, which her son had brought\nfrom foreign parts. Her name was Joy Morgeson; the fact of her being\ncousin to father's grandmother entitled her to a raid upon us at any\nseason, and to call us \"cousins.\" She felt, she said, that she must\ncome and attend the meetings regular, for her time upon earth was\nshort. But Joy was a hearty woman still, and, pious as she was,\ndelighted in rough and scandalous stories, the telling of which gave\nher severe fits of repentance. She quilted elaborate petticoats for\nus, knit stockings for Arthur, and was useful. Mr. and Mrs. Elisha\nPeckham surprised us next. They arrived from \"up country\" and stayed\ntwo weeks. I did not clearly understand why they came before they\nwent; but as they enjoyed their visit, it was of little consequence\nwhether I did or not.\n\nMidwinter passed, and we still had company. There was much to do, but\nit was done without system. Mother or Aunt Merce detailed from their\nordinary duties as keeper of the visitors, Fanny was for the first\ntime able to make herself of importance in the family tableaux,\nand assumed cares no one had thought of giving her. She left the\ntown-school, telling mother that learning would be of no use to her.\nThe rights of a human being merely was what she wanted; she should\nfight for them; that was what paupers must do. Mother allowed her\nto do as she pleased. Her duties commenced with calling us up to\nbreakfast _en masse_, and for once the experiment was successful,\nfor we all met at the table. The dining-room was in complete order, a\nthing that had never happened early before; the rest of us missed the\nstraggling breakfast which consumed so much time.\n\n\"Whose doing is this?\" asked father, looking round the table.\n\n\"It is Fanny's,\" I answered, rattling the cups. \"All the coffee to be\npoured out at once, don't agitate me.\"\n\nFanny, bearing buckwheat cakes, looked proud and modest, as people do\nwho appreciate their own virtues.\n\n\"Why, Fanny,\" said the father, \"you have done wonders; you are more\noriginal than Cassy or Verry.\"\n\nHer green eyes glowed; her aspect was so feline that I expected her\nhair to rise.\n\n\"Father's praise pleases you more than ours,\" Verry said.\n\n\"You never gave me any,\" she answered, marching out.\n\nFather looked up at Verry, annoyed, but said nothing. We paid no\nattention to Fanny's call afterward; but she continued her labors,\nwhich proved acceptable to him. Temperance told me, when she was with\nus for a week, that his overcoats, hats, umbrellas, and whips never\nhad such care as Fanny gave them. He omitted from this time to ask us\nif we knew where his belongings were, but went to Fanny; and I noticed\nthat he required much attendance.\n\nTemperance, who had arrived in the thick of the company, as she termed\nit, was sorry to go back to Abram. He _was_ a good man, she said; but\nit was a dreadful thing for a woman to lose her liberty, especially\nwhen liberty brought so much idle time. \"Why, girls, I have quilted\nand darned up every rag in the house. He _will_ do half the housework\nhimself; he is an everlasting Betty.\" She was cheerful, however, and\nhelped Hepsey, as well as the rest of us.\n\nThe guests did not encroach on my time, but it was a relief to have\nthem gone and the house our own once more.\n\nI went to Milford again, almost daily, to feast my eyes on the bleak,\nflat, gray landscape. The desolation of winter sustains our frail\nhopes. Nature is kindest then; she does not taunt us with fruition.\nIt is the luxury of summer which tantalizes--her long, brilliant,\nblossoming days, her dewy, radiant nights.\n\nEntering the house one March evening, when it was unusually still,\nI had reached the front hall, when masculine tones struck my ears. I\nopened the parlor door softly, and saw Ben Somers in an easy-chair,\nbasking before a glowing fire, his luminous face set toward Veronica,\nwho was near him, holding a small screen between her and the fire.\n\"She is always ready,\" I thought, contemplating her as I would a\npicture. Her ruby-colored merino dress absorbed the light; she was\na mass of deep red, except her face and hair, above which her silver\ncrescent comb shone. Her slender feet were tapping the rug. She wore\nboots the color of her dress; Ben was looking at them. Mother was\nthere, and in the background Aunt Merce and Fanny figured. I pushed\nthe door wide; as the stream of cold air reached them, they looked\ntoward it, and cried--\"Cassandra!\" Ben started up with extended hands.\n\n\"I went as far as Cape Horn only, but I bought you the idol and lots\nof things I promised from a passing ship. I have been home a week, and\nI am _here_. Are you glad? Can I stay?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" chorused the company, and I was too busy trying to get\noff my gloves to speak. Father came in, and welcomed him with warmth.\nFanny ran out for a lamp; when she brought it, Veronica changed the\nposition of her screen, and held it close to her face.\n\n\"Did you have a cold ride, Locke?\" asked mother, gazing into the\nfire with that expression of satisfaction we have when somebody beside\nourselves has been exposed to hardships. It is the same principle\nentertained by those who depend upon and enjoy seeing criminals hung.\n\nMeanwhile my bonnet-strings got in a knot, which Fanny saw, and\nwas about to apply scissors, when Aunt Merce, unable to bear the\nsacrifice, interfered and untied them, all present so interested in\nthe operation that conversation was suspended. Presently Aunt Merce\nwas called out, and was shortly followed by mother and Fanny. Ben\nstood before me; his eyes, darting sharp rays, pierced me through;\nthey rested on the thread-like scars which marked my cheek, and which\nwere more visible from the effect of cold.\n\n\"Tattooed still,\" I said in a low voice, pointing to them.\n\n\"I see\"--a sorrowful look crossed his face; he took my hand and kissed\nit. Veronica, who had dropped the screen, met my glance toward her\nwith one perfectly impassive. As they watched me, I saw myself as they\ndid. A tall girl in gray, whose deep, controlled voice vibrated in\ntheir ears, like the far-off sounds we hear at night from woods or the\nsea, whose face was ineffaceably marked, whose air impressed with a\nsense of mystery. I think both would have annihilated my personality\nif possible, for the sake of comprehending me, for both loved me in\ntheir way.\n\n\"What are you reading, father?\" asked Veronica suddenly.\n\n\"To-day's letters, and I must be off for Boston; would you like to\ngo?\"\n\n\"My sister Adelaide has sent for you, Cassandra, to visit us,\" said\nBen, \"and will you go too, Veronica?\"\n\n\"Thanks, I must decline. If Cass should go--and she will--I may go to\nBoston.\"\n\nHe looked at her curiously. \"It would not be pleasant for you to\nattempt Belem. I hate it, but I feel a fate-impelling power in regard\nto Cassandra; I want her there.\"\n\n\"May I go then?\" I asked.\n\n\"Certainly,\" father replied.\n\n\"Please come out to supper,\" called Fanny. \"We have something\nparticular for you, Mr. Morgeson.\"\n\nWe saw mother at the table, a book in her hand. She was finishing a\nchapter in \"The Hour and the Man.\" Aunt Merce stood eyeing the dishes\nwith the aspect of a judge. As father took his seat, near Veronica,\nFanny, according to habit, stood behind it. With the most _degag\u00c3\u00a9_\nair, Ben suffered nothing to escape him, and I never forgot the\npicture of that moment.\n\nWe talked of Helen's visit--a subject that could be commented\non freely. Veronica told Ben Helen's opinion of him; he reddened\nslightly, and said that such a sage could not be contradicted. When\nfather remarked that the opinions of women were whimsical, Fanny gave\nan audible sniff, which made Ben smile.\n\nSoon after tea I met Veronica in the hall, with a note in her hand.\nShe stopped and hesitatingly said that she was going to send for\nTemperance; she wanted her while Mr. Somers stayed.\n\n\"Your forethought astonishes me.\"\n\n\"She is a comfort always to me.\"\n\n\"Do you stand in especial need of a comforter?\"\n\nShe looked puzzled, laughed, and left me.\n\nTemperance arrived that evening, in time to administer a scolding to\nFanny.\n\n\"That girl needs looking after,\" she said. \"She is as sharp as a\nneedle. She met me in the yard and told me that a man fit for a\nnobleman had come on a visit. 'It may be for Cass,' says she, 'and it\nmay not be. I have my doubts.' Did you ever?\" concluded Temperance,\ncounting the knives. \"There's one missing. By jingo! it has been\nthrown to the pigs, I'll bet.\"\n\nWhen Ben made a show of going, we asked him to stay longer. He said\n\"Yes,\" so cordially, that we laughed. But it hurt me to see that he\nhad forgotten all about my going to Belem. \"I like Surrey so much,\"\nhe said, \"and you all, I have a fancy that I am in the Hebrides,\nin Magnus Troil's dwelling; it is so wild here, so _na\u00c3\u00afve_. The\nunadulterated taste of sea-spray is most beautiful.\"\n\n\"We will have Cass for Norna,\" said Verry; \"but, by the way, it is you\nthat must be of the fitful head; have you forgotten that she is going\nto Belem soon?\"\n\n\"I shall remember Belem in good time; no fear of my forgetting that\nace--ancient spot. At least I may wait till your father goes to\nBoston, and we can make a party. You will be ready, Cassandra? I wrote\nAdelaide yesterday that you were coming, and mother will expect you.\"\n\nIt often stormed during his visit. We had driving rains, and a gale\nfrom the southeast, oceanward, which made our sea dark and miry, even\nafter the storm had ceased and patches of blue sky were visible.\n\nOur rendezvous was in the parlor, which, from the way in which Ben\nknocked about the furniture, cushions, and books, assumed an air which\nsomehow subdued Veronica's love for order; she played for him, or they\nread together, and sometimes talked; he taught her chess, and then\nthey quarreled. One day--a long one to me,--they were so much absorbed\nin each other, I did not seek them till dusk.\n\n\"Come and sing to me,\" called Ben.\n\n\"So you remember that I do sing?\"\n\n\"Sing; there is a spell in this weird twilight; sing, or I go out on\nthe rocks to break it.\"\n\nHe dropped the window curtains and sat by me at the piano, and I sang:\n\n  \"I feel the breath of the summer night,\n      Aromatic fire;\n  The trees, the vines, the flowers are astir\n      With tender desire.\n\n  \"If I were alone, I could not sing,\n      Praises to thee;\n  O night! unveil the beautiful soul\n      That awaiteth me!\"\n\n\"A foolish song,\" said Veronica, pulling her hair across her face.\nNo reply. She glided to the flower-basket, broke a rosebud from its\nstalk, and mutely offered it to him. Whether he took it, I know not;\nbut he rose up from beside me, like a dark cloud, and my eyes followed\nhim.\n\n\"Come Veronica,\" he whispered, \"give me yourself. I love you,\nVeronica.\"\n\nHe sank down before her; she clasped her hands round his head, and\nkissed his hair.\n\n\"I know it,\" she said, in a clear voice.\n\nI shut the door softly, thinking of the Wandering Jew, went upstairs,\nhumming a little air between my teeth, and came down again into the\ndining-room, which was in a blaze of light.\n\n\"What preserves are these, Temperance?\" I asked, going to the table.\n\"Some of Abram's quinces?\"\n\n\"Best you ever tasted, since you were born.\"\n\n\"Call Mr. Somers, Fanny,\" said mother. \"Is Verry in the parlor, too?\"\n\n\"I'll call them,\" I said; \"I have left my handkerchief there.\"\n\n\"Is anything else of yours there?\" said Fanny, close to my ear.\n\nBen had pushed back the curtain, and was staring into the darkness;\nVeronica was walking to and fro on the rug.\n\n\"Haven't I a great musical talent?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Am I happy?\" she asked, coming toward me.\n\nBen turned to speak, but Veronica put her hand over his mouth, and\nsaid:\n\n\"Why should I be 'hushed,' my darling?\"\n\n\"Come to supper, and be sensible,\" I urged.\n\nThe light revealed a new expression in Verry's face--an unsettled,\ndispossessed look; her brows were knitted, yet she smiled over and\nover again, while she seemed hardly aware that she was eating like an\nordinary mortal. The imp Fanny tried experiments with her, by offering\nthe same dishes repeatedly, till her plate was piled high with food\nshe did not taste.\n\nThe next day was clear, and mild with spring. Ben and I started for a\nwalk on the shore. We were half-way to the lighthouse before he asked\nwhy it was that Veronica would not come with us.\n\n\"She never walks by the shore; she detests the sea.\"\n\n\"Is it so? I did not know that.\"\n\n\"Do you mind that you know few of her tastes or habits? I speak of\nthis as a general truth.\"\n\n\"I am a spectacle to you, I suppose. But this sea charms me; I shall\nlive by it, and build a house with all the windows and doors toward\nit.\"\n\n\"Not if you mean to have Verry in it.\"\n\n\"I do mean to have her in it. She shall like it. Are you willing to\nhave me for a brother? Will you go to Belem, and help break the ice?\n_She_ could never go,\" and he began to skip pebbles in the water.\n\n\"I will take you for a brother gladly. You are a fool--not for loving\nher, but all men are fools when in love, they are so besotted with\nthemselves. But I am afraid of one fault in you.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered hurriedly, \"don't I know? On my honor, I have\ntried; why not leave me to God? Didn't you leave yourself that way\nonce?\"\n\n\"Oh, you are cruel.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, dear Cass. I _must_ do well now, surely. Will you believe\nin me? Oh, do you not know the strength, the power, that comes to us\nin the stress of passion and duty?\"\n\n\"This is from _you_, Ben.\"\n\n\"Never mind; I knew I wanted to marry her, when I saw her. I love her\npassionately,\" and he threw a pebble in the water farther than he had\nyet; \"but she is so pure, so delicate, that when I approach her, in\nspite of my besottedness, my love grows lambent. That's not like me,\nyou know,\" with great vehemence. \"Will she never understand me?\"\n\nHis face darkened, and he looked so strangely intent into my eyes that\nI was obliged to turn away; he disturbed me.\n\n\"Veronica probably will not understand you, but you must manage for\nyourself. As you have discerned, she and I are far apart. She is pure,\nnoble, beautiful, and peculiar. I will have no voice between you.\"\n\n\"You must, you do. We shall hear it if you do not speak. You have a\ngreat power, tall enchantress.\"\n\n\"Certainly. What a powerful life is mine!\"\n\n\"You come to these shores often. Are you not different beside them?\nThis colorless picture before us--these vague spaces of sea and\nland--the motion of the one--the stillness of the other--have you no\nsense that you have a powerful spirit?\"\n\n\"Is it power? It is pain.\"\n\n\"Your gold has not been refined then.\"\n\n\"Yes, I confess I have a sense of power; but it is not a spiritual\nsense.\"\n\n\"Let us go back,\" he said abruptly.\n\nWe mused by our footprints in the wet sand, as we passed them. We were\ntold when we reached home that Veronica had gone on some expedition\nwith Fanny. She did not return till time for supper, looking elfish,\nand behaving whimsically, as if she had received instructions\naccordingly. I fancied that the expression Ben regarded her with might\nbe the Bellevue Pickersgill expression, it was so different from any\nI had seen. There was a haughty curiosity in his face; as she passed\nnear him, he looked into her eyes, and saw the strange cast which made\ntheir sight so far off.\n\n\"Veronica, where are you?\" he asked.\n\nThe tone of his voice attracted mother's regards; an intelligent\nglance was exchanged, and then her eyes sought mine. \"It is not as you\nthought, mamma,\" I telegraphed. But Verry, not bringing her eyes back\ninto the world, merely said, \"I am here, am I not?\" and went to shut\nherself up in her room. I found her there, looking through the wicket.\n\n\"The buds are beginning to swell,\" she said. \"I should hear small\nvoices breaking out from the earth. I grow happy every day now.\"\n\n\"Because the earth will be green again?\" I asked, in a coaxing voice.\n\nShe shut the wicket, and, looking in my face, said, \"I will go down\nimmediately.\" For some reason the tears came into my eyes, which she,\ntaking up the candle, saw. \"I am going to play,\" she said hurriedly,\n\"come.\" She ran down before me, but turning, by the foot of the\nstairs, she pointed to the parlor door, and said, \"Is he my husband?\"\n\n\"Answer for yourself. Go in, in God's name.\"\n\nBen was chatting with father over the fire; he stretched out his hand\nto her, with so firm and assured an air, and looked so noble, that I\nfelt a pang of admiration for him. She laid her hand in his a moment,\npassed on to the piano, and began to play divinely, drawing him to\nher side. Father peeled and twisted his cigar, as he contemplated them\nwith a thoughtful countenance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\n\nWhen we went to Boston we went to a new hotel, as Ben had advised,\ndeserting the old Bromfield for the Tremont. It was dusk when we\narrived, and tea was served immediately, in a large room full of\nsomber mahogany furniture. Its atmosphere oppressed Veronica, who ate\nher supper in silence.\n\n\"Charles Dickens is here, sir,\" said the waiter, who knew Ben. \"Two\nmodels of the Curiosity Shop have just gone upstairs, sir. His room is\nright over here, sir.\"\n\nVeronica looked adoringly at the ceiling.\n\n\"Then,\" said Ben, \"our hunters are up from Belem. Anybody in from\nBelem, John?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, sir, every day.\"\n\n\"I'll look them up,\" he said to us; but he returned soon, and begged\nus not to look at Dickens, if we had a chance.\n\nVeronica, with a sigh, gave him up, and lost a chance of being\nimmortalized with that perpetual and imperturbable beefsteak, covered\nwith \"the blackest of all possible pepper,\" which was daily served to\nhim.\n\nFather being out in pursuit of a cigar, Ben asked Veronica what she\nwould do while he was in Belem.\n\n\"Walk round this lion-clawed table.\"\n\n\"I shall be gone from you.\"\n\n\"Alas!\"\n\n\"Are we to part this way?\"\n\n\"Father,\" she cried, as he entered with a theater bill, \"had I better\nmarry this friend of Cassy's?\"\n\n\"Have you the courage? Do you know each other?\"\n\n\"Having known Cassandra so long, sir,\" began Ben, but was interrupted\nby Veronica's exclaiming, \"We do not know each other at all. What is\nthe use of making _that_ futile attempt? I am over eighteen, and do\nyou know me, father?\"\n\n\"If I do not, it is because you have no shadow.\"\n\n\"Shall I, then?\" giving Ben a delicious smile. \"I promise.\"\n\n\"I promise, too, Veronica,\" heaven dawning in his eyes.\n\n\"We will see about it,\" said father. \"Now who will go to the theater?\"\n\nWe declined, but Ben signified his willingness to accompany him.\n\nWe took the first morning train, so that father could return before\nevening, and ran through in the course of an hour the wooden suburbs\nof Belem, bordered by an ancient marsh, from which the sea had long\nretired. Taking a cab, we turned into Norfolk Street, at the head of\nwhich, Ben said, a mile distant, was his father's house. It was not\na cheerful street, and when we stopped before an immense square,\nthree-storied house, it looked still more gloomy! There was a gate on\none side, with white wooden urns on the posts, that shut off a paved\ncourtway. On each side of the street were houses of the same pattern,\nwith the same gates. Down the paved court of the opposite house a\ncoach pulled by two fat horses clattered, and as the coach turned we\nsaw two old ladies inside, highly dressed, bowing and smiling at Ben.\n\n\"The Miss Hiticutts--hundred thousand apiece.\"\n\n\"Hundred thousand apiece,\" I echoed in an anguish of admiration, which\nmade my father laugh and Ben scowl. A servant in a linen jacket opened\nthe door. \"Is it yourself, Mr. Ben?\"\n\n\"Open the parlor door, Murph. Where's my mother and my sister?\"\n\n\"Miss Somers is taking her exercise, sir, and Mrs. Somers is with\nthe owld gentleman\"; opening the door, with the performance of taking\nfather's hat.\n\n\"Sit down, Cassandra. I'll look up somebody.\"\n\nIt was a bewildering matter where to go; the room, vast and dark, was\na complete litter of tables and sofas. The tables were loaded with\nlamps, books, and knick-knacks of every description; the sofas were\nstrewn with English and French magazines, novels, and papers. I went\nto the window, while father perched on the music stool.\n\nMy attention was diverted to a large dog in the court, chained to\na post near a pump, where a man was giving water to a handsome bay\nhorse, at the same time keeping his eye on an individual who stood on\na stone block, dressed in a loose velvet coat, a white felt hat,\nand slippers down at the heel. He had a coach whip in his hand--the\nhandsomest hand I ever saw, which he snapped at the dog, who growled\nwith rage. I heard Ben's voice in remonstrance; then a lazy laugh from\nvelvet coat, who gave the dog a cut which made him bound. Ben, untying\nhim, was overwhelmed with caresses. \"Down, you fool! Off, Rash!\"\nhe said. \"Look there,\" pointing to the window where I stood. The\ngentleman with the coach whip looked at me also. The likeness to\nBen turned my suspicion into certainty that they were brothers. His\ndisposition, I thought, must be lovely, judging from the episode with\n\"Rash.\" I turned away, almost running against a lady, who extended her\nfingers toward me with a quick little laugh, and said:\n\n\"How de do? Where's Ben, to introduce us properly?\"\n\n\"Here, mother,\" he said behind her, followed by the dog. \"You were\nexpecting Cassandra, my old chum; and Mr. Morgeson has come to leave\nher with us.\"\n\n\"Certainly. Rash, go out, dear. Mr. Morgeson, I am sorry to say,\" she\nspoke with more politeness, \"that Mr. Somers is confined to his room\nwith gout. May I take you up?\"\n\n\"I have a short time to stay,\" looking at his watch and rising. \"Do\nyou consider the old school friendship between your son and Cassandra\na sufficient reason for leaving her with you? To say nothing of the\nfaint relationship which, we suppose, exists.\"\n\n\"Of course, very happy; Adelaide expects her,\" she said vaguely. I saw\nat once that she had never heard a word of our being relations. Ben\nhad managed nicely in the affair of my invitation to Belem. But I\ndesired to remain, in spite of Mrs. Somers's reception.\n\nMr. Somers was bolstered up in bed, in a flowered dressing gown, with\na bottle of colchicum and a pile of Congressional reports on a stand\nbeside him. His urbanity was extreme; it was evident that the gout was\nnot allowed to interfere with his deportment, though the joints of\nhis hands were twisted and knotty. He expatiated upon Ben's long\nungratified wish for a visit from me, and thanked father for complying\nwith it. He mentioned the memento of the miniature, and gave every\nparticular of Locke Morgeson's early marriage, explaining the exact\nshade of consanguinity--a faint one. I glanced at Mrs. Somers, who\nsat remote, in the act of inspecting me, with an eye askance, which I\nafterward found was her mode of looking at those whom she doubted\nor disliked; it changed its expression, as it met mine, into one of\nhaughty wonder, that said there could be no tie of blood between us.\nShe irritated and embarrassed me. I tried to think of something\nto say, and uttered a few words, which were uncommonly trivial and\nawkward. Mr. Somers touched on politics. The door opened, and Ben's\nbrother entered, with downcast eyes. Advancing to the footboard of the\nbed, he leaned his chin on its edge, looked at his father, and in a\nremarkably clear, ringing voice, said:\n\n\"The check.\"\n\nMr. Somers coughed behind his hand. \"To-morrow will do, Desmond.\"\n\n\"To-day will do.\"\n\n\"Desmond,\" said Ben in a low voice, \"you do not see Mr. Morgeson and\nMiss Morgeson. My brother, Cassandra.\"\n\n\"Beg pardon, good-morning\"; and he pulled off his hat with an air of\ngrace which became him, though it was very indifferent. Mrs. Somers in\na soft voice said: \"Ring, Des, dear, will you?\" He warned her with\na satirical smile, and gave such a pull at the bell-rope that it came\ndown. Her florid face flushed a deeper red, but he had gone. Father\nlooked at his watch, and got up with alacrity.\n\n\"You are to dine with us, at least, Mr. Morgeson.\"\n\n\"I must return to Boston on account of my daughter, who is there\nalone.\"\n\n\"Have you been remiss, Ben,\" said his father affectionately, \"in not\nbringing her also?\"\n\n\"She would not come, of course, father.\"\n\nA tall, black-haired girl of twenty-five rushed in.\n\n\"Why, Ben,\" she said, \"you were not expected. And this is Miss\nMorgeson,\" shaking hands with me. \"You will spend a month, won't\nyou?\" She put her chin in her hand, and scanned me with a cool\ndeliberateness. \"Pa, do you think she is like Caroline Bingham?\"\n\n\"Yes, so she is; but fairer. She is a great belle,\" nodding to me.\n\n\"Do you _really_ think she looks like her, Somers?\" said Mrs. Somers,\nin a tone of denial.\n\n\"Certainly, but handsomer,\" Adelaide replied for him, without looking\nat her mother.\n\n\"Would you like to go to your room?\" she asked. \"What a pretty dress\nthis is!\" taking hold of the sleeve, her chin in her hand still. \"We\nwill have some walks; Belem is nice for walking. Pa, how do you feel\nnow?\"\n\nShe allowed me to go downstairs with father, without following, and\nsent Murphy in with wine and biscuit. I put my arms round his neck and\nkissed him, for I had a lonesome feeling, which I could not define at\nthe last moment.\n\n\"You will not stay long,\" he said; \"there is something oppressive in\nthis atmosphere.\"\n\n\"Something artificial, is it? It must be the blood of the Bellevue\nPickersgills that thickens the air.\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Ben, with father's hat in his hand, \"the time is up.\"\n\nAdelaide was at the door to take courteous leave of him, and Mrs.\nSomers bowed from the top of the stairs, revealing a pair of large\nankles, whose base rested in a pair of shabby, pudgy slippers.\nAdelaide then took me to my room, telling me not to change my dress,\nbut to come down soon, for dinner was ready. Hearing a bell, I hurried\ndown to the parlor which we were in before, and waited for directions\nrespecting the dinner. Adelaide came presently. \"We are dining; come\nand sit next me,\" offering her arm. Mrs. Somers, Desmond, and a girl\nof fifteen were at the table. The latter had just come from school,\nI concluded, as a satchel of books hung at her chair. Murphy was\nremoving the soup, and I derived the impression that I had been\nforgotten. While taking mine, they vaguely stared about till Murphy\nbrought in the roast mutton, except Adelaide, who rubbed her teeth\nwith a dry crust, making a feint of eating it. Desmond kept the\ndecanter, occasionally swallowing a glassful.\n\n\"What wine is that, Murphy?\" Mrs. Somers asked. He hesitatingly\nanswered, \"I think it is the Juno, mum.\"\n\n\"You stole the key from pa's room, Des,\" said the girl. He shook the\ncarving-knife at her, at which gesture she said \"Pooh!\" and applied\nherself to the roast mutton with avidity. They all ate largely,\nespecially the girl, whose wide mouth was filled with splendid teeth.\nMrs. Somers made a motion with her glass for Murphy to bring her the\nwine, and pouring a teaspoonful, held it to her mouth, as if she were\npracticing drinking healths. Her hands were beautiful, too; they all\nhad handsome hands, whose movements were graceful and expressive. When\nBen arrived, Murphy set the dishes before him, and Adelaide began to\ntalk in a lively, brilliant way. He did not ask for wine, but I saw\nhim look toward it and Desmond. The decanter was empty. After the\ndessert, Mrs. Somers arose and we followed; but she soon left us, and\nwe went to the parlor. The girl, taking a seat beside me, said: \"My\nname is Ann Somers. I am never introduced; Adder, my sister, is in\nthe way, you know. I dare say Ben never spoke of me to you. I am never\nspoken of, am never noticed. I have never had new dresses; yet pa is\nmy friend, the dear soul.\"\n\nAdelaide looked upon her with the same superb indifference with which\nshe regarded her mother and Desmond.\n\n\"Would you like to go to your room?\" she asked again. \"You are too\ntired to take a walk, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Lord!\" said Ann, \"do let her do as she likes. Adder, don't be too\ndisagreeable.\"\n\nI picked up my bonnet, which she took from me, and put on the top of\nher head as we went upstairs.\n\n\"Murph must bring up your trunk,\" said Ann, opening the closet. \"But\nthere is no space to hang anything; the great Mogul's wardrobe stops\nthe way.\"\n\nMy chamber was stately in size and appointments. The afternoon sun\nshone in, where a shutter was open, behind the dull red curtains,\nand illuminated the portrait of a nimble old lady in a scarlet cloak,\nwhich hung near the gigantic curtained bed, over a vast chair, covered\nwith faded green damask.\n\n\"Grandmother Pickersgill,\" said Ann, who saw me observing the picture.\nAdelaide contemplated it also. \"It was painted by Copley,\" she said,\n\"Lord Lyndhurst afterwards. Grandfather entertained him, and he went\nto one of grandmother's parties; he complimented her on her beauty.\nBut you see that she has not a handsome hand. Ours is the Pickersgill\nhand,\" and she spread her fingers like a fan. \"She was a regular old\nscrew,\" continued Ann, \"and used to have mother's underclothes tucked\nto last for ever; she was a beast to servants, too.\"\n\nMy trunk was brought in, which I unlocked and unpacked, while Adelaide\nopened a drawer in a great bureau.\n\n\"Oh, you know it is full of Marm's fineries,\" said Ann, in a\nconfidential tone; \"I'll ring for Hannah.\" Adelaide busied herself in\nthrowing the contents of the drawers on the floor. \"There's her ball\ndresses,\" commented Ann, as a pink satin, trimmed with magnificent\nlace, tumbled out. \"Old Carew brought the lace over for her.\"\n\n\"Bring a basket, Hannah, and take these away somewhere, to some other\ncloset of Mrs. Somers's.\"\n\n\"That gold fringe, do you remember, Adder? She looked like an elephant\nwith his howdah on when she wore it.\"\n\nHer impertinence inspired Adelaide, who joined her in a flow of\nvituperative wit at the expense of their mother and other relatives,\nincidentally brought in. Instead of being aghast, I enjoyed it, and\nwas feverish with a desire to be as brilliant, for my vocabulary was\ndeficient and my sense of inferiority was active during the whole\nof my visit in Belem. I blushed often, smiled foolishly, and was\nafflicted with a general apprehension in regard to _gaucherie_.\n\nI changed my traveling dress, as they were not inclined to leave me,\nwith anxiety, for I was weak enough to wish to make an impression\nwith my elegant bearing and appointments. Being so anatomized, I was\noppressed with an indefinite discouragement. Their stealthy, sharp,\nselfish scrutiny brought out my failures. My dress seemed ill-made; my\nhair unbecomingly dressed; my best collar and ribbon, which I put on,\nwere nothing to the lace I had just seen falling on the floor. When we\ndescended it was twilight. Ann said she must study, and left us by the\nparlor fire. Adelaide lighted a candle, and took a novel, which she\nread reclining on a sofa. Reclining on sofas, I discovered, was a\nfamily trait, though they were all in a state of the most robust\nhealth, with the exception of Mr. Somers. I walked up and down the\nrooms. \"They were fine once,\" said Ben, who appeared from a dark\ncorner, \"but faded now. Mother never changes anything if she can\nhelp it. She is a terrible aristocrat,\" he continued, in a low voice,\n\"fixed in the ideas imbedded in the Belem institutions, which only\nmove backward. We laugh, though, at everybody's claims but our own.\nYou despised me for mentioning the Hiticutts' income; it was the\natmosphere.\"\n\n\"It amuses me to be here.\"\n\n\"Of course; but stir up Adelaide, she is genuine; has fine sense, and\nhalf despises her life; but she knows no other, and is proud.\"\n\n\"Let's go and find tea,\" she said, yawning, dropping her book. \"Why\ndon't that lazy Murph light the lamp? I wish pa was down to regulate\naffairs.\" No one was at the tea-table but Mrs. Somers.\n\n\"Ben is very polite, don't you think so?\" she said with her peculiar\nlaugh, which made my flesh creep, as he pulled up a chair for me. Her\nvoice made me dizzy, but I smiled. Ben was not the same in Belem,\nI saw at once, and no longer wondered at its influence, or at the\nvacillating nature of his plans and pursuits. Mrs. Somers gave me\nsome tea from a spider-shaped silver tea-pot, which was related to a\nspider-shaped cream-jug and a spider-shaped sugar-dish. The polished\nsurface of the mahogany table reflected a pair of tall silver\ncandlesticks, and the plates, being of warped blue and white Chinese\nware, joggled and clattered when we touched them. The tea was\ndelicious; I said so, but Mrs. Somers deigned no answer. We were\nregaled with spread bread and butter and baked apples. Adelaide ate\nsix.\n\n\"We do not have your Surrey suppers,\" Ben remarked.\n\n\"How should you know?\" his mother asked. Ben's eyes looked violent\nand he bit his lips. Adelaide commenced speaking before her mother had\nfinished her question, as if she only needed the spur of her voice to\nbe lively and agreeable, _per contra_.\n\n\"Hepburn must ask us to tea. Her jam and her gossip are wonderful.\nAunt Tucker might ask us too, with housekeeper Beck's permission. I\nlike tea fights with the old Hindoos. They like us too, Ben; we are\nthe children of Hindoos also--superior to the rest of the world. There\nwill be a party or two for this young person.\"\n\n\"Parties be hanged!\" he said. \"Then we must have a rout here, and I\nhate 'em.\"\n\n\"But we owe an entertainment,\" said Mrs. Somers. \"I have been thinking\nof giving one as soon as Mr. Somers gets out.\"\n\n\"I have no such idea,\" said Adelaide, with her back toward her mother.\n\"We shall have no party until some one has been given to our young\nfriend, Ben.\"\n\nBen and I visited his father, who asked questions relative to the\ntemperature, the water, and the dietetic qualities of Surrey. He was\naffable, but there was no nearness in his affability. He skated on\nthe ice of appearances, and that was his vocation in his family. He\nfulfilled it well, but it was a strain sometimes. His family broke the\nice now and then, which must have made him plunge into the depths\nof reality. I learned to respect his courage, bad as his cause was.\nMarrying Bellevue Pickersgill for her money, he married his master,\nand was endowed only with the privilege of settling her taxes. Simon\nPickersgill, her father, tied up the main part of his money for his\ngrandchildren. It was to be divided among them when the youngest son\nshould arrive at the age of twenty-one--an event which took place, I\nsupposed, while Ben was on his way to India. Desmond and an older son,\nwho resided anywhere except at home, made havoc with the income. As\nthe principal prospectively was theirs, or nearly the whole of it, why\nshould they not dispose of that?\n\nAt last Mr. Somers looked at his watch, a gentle reminder that it was\ntime for us to withdraw. Adelaide was still in the parlor, lying on\nher favorite sofa contemplating the ceiling. I asked permission to\nretire, which she granted without removing her regards. In spite of my\nsound sleep that night, I was started from it by the wail of a young\nchild. The strangeness of the chamber, and the continued crying,\nwhich I could not locate, kept me awake at intervals till dawn peeped\nthrough the curtains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\n\nA few days after my arrival, some friends dined with Mrs. Somers. The\ndaughters of a senator, as Ann informed me, and an ex-governor, or I\nshould not have known this fact, for I was not introduced. The dinner\nwas elaborate, and Desmond did the honors. With the walnuts one of the\nladies asked for the baby.\n\nMrs. Somers made a sign to Desmond, who pulled the bell-rope--mildly\nthis time. An elderly woman instantly appeared with a child a few\nmonths old, puny and anxious-looking. Mrs. Somers took it from her,\nand placed it on the table; it tottered and nodded to the chirrups of\nthe guests. Ben, from the opposite side of the table, addressed me by\na look, which enlightened me. His voyage to India was useless, as the\nproperty would stand for twenty-one years more, lacking some months,\nunless Providence interposed. Adelaide was oblivious of the child,\nbut Desmond thumped his glass on the mahogany to attract it, for its\nenergies were absorbed in swallowing its fists and fretfully crying.\nWhen Murphy announced coffee in the parlor, the nurse took it away;\nand after coffee and sponge cake were served the visitors drove off.\nThat afternoon some friends of Adelaide called, to whom she introduced\nme as \"cousin.\" She gave graphic descriptions of them, after their\ndeparture. One had achieved greatness by spending her winters in\nWashington, and contracting a friendship with John C. Calhoun. Another\nwas an artist who had painted an ideal head of her ancestor, Sir\nRoger de Roger, not he who had arrived some years ago as a weaver from\nGlasgow, but the one who had remained on the family estate. A third\nreviewed books and collected autographs.\n\nThe next afternoon one of the Miss Hiticutts from across the way came,\nin a splendid camel's-hair shawl and a shabby dress. \"How _is_ Mr.\nSomers?\" she asked. \"He is such a martyr.\"\n\nHere Mrs. Somers entered. \"My dear Bellevue, you are worn out with\nyour devotion to him; when have you taken the air?\" She did not wait\nfor a reply, but addressed Adelaide with, \"This is your young friend,\nand where is my favorite, Mr. Ben, and little Miss Ann? Have you\nanything new? I went down to Harris yesterday to tell her she must\nsweep away her old trash of a circulating library, and begin with the\nNew Regime of Novels, which threatens to overwhelm us.\"\n\nAdelaide talked slowly at first, and then soared into a region where\nI had never seen a woman--an intellectual one. Miss Hiticutt followed\nher, and I experienced a new pleasure. Mrs. Somers was silent, but\nlistened with respect to Miss Hiticutt, for she was of the real Belem\nazure in blood as well as in brain; besides, she was rich, and would\nnever marry. It was a Pickersgill hallucination to be attentive to\npeople who had legacies in their power. Mrs. Somers had a bequested\nfortune already in hair rings and silver ware. While appearing to\nlisten to Adelaide, her eyes wandered over me with speculation askant\nin them. Adelaide was so full of _esprit_ that I was again smitten\nwith my inferiority, and from this time I felt a respect for her,\nwhich never declined, although she married an Englishman, who, too\ncholeric to live in America, took her to Florence, where they settled\nwith their own towels and silver, and are likely to remain, for her\nheart is too narrow to comprise any further interest in Belem.\n\nMiss Hiticutt chatted herself out, giving us an invitation to tea, for\nany day, including Ben and Miss Ann, who had not been visible since\nbreakfast.\n\nApril rains kept us indoors for several days. Ann refused to go to\nschool. She must have a holiday; besides, pa needed her; she alone\ncould take care of him, after all. Her mother said that she must go.\n\n\"Who can make me, mum?\"\n\nDesmond ordered the coach for her. When it was ready he put her in it,\nseated himself beside her, with provoking nonchalance, and carried her\nto school. Murphy, with his velvet-banded hat, left her satchel at the\ndoor, with a ceremonious air, which made Ann slap his cheek and call\nhim an old grimalkin. But she was obliged to walk home in the rain,\nafter waiting an hour for him to come back.\n\nMr. Somers hobbled about his room, with the help of his cane, and said\nthat he should be out soon, and requested Adelaide to put in order\nsome book-shelves that were in the third story, for he wanted to\nread without confusion. We went there together, and sorted some odd\nvolumes; piles of Unitarian sermons, bound magazines, political works,\nand a heap of histories. Ben found a seat on a bunch of books, pleased\nto see us together.\n\n\"This is a horrid hole,\" he said. \"I have not been up in this floor\nfor ages. How do the shelves look?\"\n\nA hiccough near us caused us to look toward the door.\n\n\"It is only Des, in his usual afternoon trim,\" said Ben.\n\nShe nodded, as he pushed open the door, thrusting in his head. \"What\nthe hell are you doing here? This region is sacred to Chaos and old\nNight,\" striking the panels, first one and then the other, with the\ntassels of his dressing-gown. No one answered him. Adelaide counted a\nrow of books, and Ben whistled.\n\n\"Damn you, Ben,\" he said, in a languid voice: \"you never seem bored.\nCurse you all. I hate ye, especially that she-Calmuck yonder--that\nSiberian-steppe-natured, malachite-hearted girl, our sister.\"\n\n\"Oh come away, Mr. Desmond. What are the poor things doing that you\nshould harry them?\" and the woman who had brought in the baby the day\nof the dinner laid her hands on him and pulled him away.\n\n\"Sarah will never give him up,\" said Ben.\n\n\"She swears there is good in him. I think he is a wretch,\" turning\nover the leaves of a book with her beautiful hand, such a hand as I\nhad just seen beating the door--such a hand as clasped its fellow in\nBen's hair. Adelaide was not embarrassed at my presence. She neither\nsought nor avoided my look. But Ben said, \"You are thinking.\"\n\n\"Is she?\" And Adelaide raised her eyes.\n\n\"You are all so much alike,\" I said.\n\n\"You are right,\" she answered seriously. \"Our grandfather--\"\n\n\"Confound him!\" broke in Ben. \"I wish he had never been born. Are\nyou proud, Addie, of being like the Pickersgills? But I know you are.\nRemember that the part of us which is Pickersgill hates its like. I am\noff; I am going to walk.\"\n\nAdelaide coolly said, after he had gone, that he was very visionary,\npredicting changes that could not be, and determined to bring them\nabout.\n\n\"Why did he bring me here?\" I asked, as if I were asking in a dream.\n\n\"Ben's hospitality is genuine. He is like pa. Besides, you are related\nto us--on the Somers side, and are the first visitor we ever saw,\noutside of mother's connection. Do you not know, too, that Ben's\nfriendship is very sincere--very strong?\"\n\n\"I begin to comprehend the Pickersgills,\" I remarked as if in a dream.\n\"How words with any meaning glance off, when addressed to them. How\nimpossible it is to return the impression they give. How incapable\nthey are of appreciating what they cannot appropriate to the use of\ntheir idiosyncrasies.\"\n\nShe gazed at me, as if she heard an abstract subject discussed, with a\nslight interest in her black eyes.\n\n\"Are they vicious to the death?\" I went on with this dream. \"It is\nnot fair--their overpowering personality--it is not fair to others. It\noverpowers me, though I know it is _all_ fallacious.\"\n\n\"I am ignorant of Ethical Philosophy.\"\n\n\"Miss Somers,\" said Murphy, knocking, \"if Major Millard is below?\"\n\n\"I am coming.\"\n\nShe smiled when she looked at me again. I stared at her with a\nsingular feeling. Had I touched her, or had I made a fool of myself?\n\n\"There is some nice gingerbread in the closet. Sha'n't I get you a\npiece?\"\n\nI fell out of my dream.\n\n\"Major Millard is an old beau. Come down and captivate him. He likes\nfair women.\"\n\nDeclining the gingerbread, I accepted the Major. He was an old\ngentleman, in a good deal of highly starched linen, amusing himself\nby teazing Ann, who liked it, and paid him in impertinence. Adelaide\nplayed chess with him. Desmond sauntered in about nine, threw himself\ninto a chair behind the sofa where I sat, and swung his arm over the\nback. The chessboard was put aside, and a gossipy conversation was\nstarted, which included Mrs. Somers, who was on a sofa across the\nroom, but he did not join in it. I watched Mrs. Somers, as her fingers\nmoved with her Berlin knitting, feeling more composed and settled as\nto my identity, in spite of my late outburst, than I had felt at\nany moment since my arrival in Belem. They were laughing at a funny\ndescription, which Ann was giving of a meeting she had witnessed\nbetween Miss Hiticutt and Mr. Pearsall, a gentleman lately arrived\nfrom China, after a twenty years' residence, with several lacs of\nrupees. Her delineation of Miss Hiticutt, who attempted to appear as\nshe had twenty years before, was excellent. Ben, who was rolling and\nunrolling his mother's yarn, laughed till the tears ran, but Major\nMillard looked uneasy, as if he expected to be served _\u00c3\u00a0-la_-Hiticutt\nby the satirical Ann after his departure. Before the laughter\nsubsided, I heard a low voice at my ear, and felt a slight touch from\nthe tip of a finger on my cheek.\n\n\"How came those scars?\"\n\nI brushed my cheek with my handkerchief, and answered, \"I got them in\nbattle.\"\n\nHe left his chair, and walked slowly through the room into the dark\nfront parlor. Major Millard took leave, and was followed by Mrs.\nSomers and Ann, neither of whom returned. As Ben stretched himself\non his sofa with an air of relief, Desmond emerged from the dark and\nstood behind him, leaning against a column, with his hands in his coat\npockets and his eyes searchingly fixed upon me. Ben, turning his head\nin my direction, sprang up so suddenly that I started; but Desmond's\neyes did not move till Ben confronted him; then he gave him a haughty\nsmile, and begged him to take his repose again.\n\nI went to the piano and ran my fingers over the keys.\n\n\"Do you play? Can you sing?\" asked Adelaide, rousing herself.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do sing. I never talk music; but I like it.\"\n\n\"Some old song,\" said Ben.\n\nSinging\n\n  \"Drink to me only with thine eyes,\n    And I will pledge with mine,\"\n\nI became conscious that Desmond was near me. With a perfectly pure\nvoice he joined in the song:\n\n  \"The thirst that from the soul doth rise,\n    Doth ask a drink divine.\"\n\nAs the tones of his voice floated through the room, I was where I saw\nthe white sea-birds flashing between the blue deeps of our summer\nsea and sky, and the dark rocks that rose and dipped in the murmuring\nwaves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\n\nOne pleasant afternoon Adelaide and I started on a walk. We must go\nthrough the crooked length of Norfolk Street, till we reached the\noutskirts of Belem, and its low fields not yet green; that was the\nfashionable promenade, she said. After the two o'clock dinner, Belem\nwalked. All her acquaintances seemed to be in the street, so many bows\nwere given and returned with ceremony. Nothing familiar was attempted,\nnothing beyond the courtliness of an artificial smile.\n\nReturning, we met Desmond with a lady, and a series of bows took\nplace. Desmond held his hat in his hand till we had passed; his\nexpression varied so much from what it was when I saw him last, at the\nbreakfast table, he being in a desperate humor then, that it served me\nfor mental comment for some minutes.\n\n\"That is Miss Brewster,\" said Adelaide. \"She is an heiress, and\nfancies Desmond's attentions: she will not marry him, though.\"\n\n\"Is every woman in Belem an heiress?\"\n\n\"Those we talk about are, and every man is a fortune-hunter. Money\nmarries money; those who have none do not marry. Those who wait hope.\nBut the great fortunes of Belem are divided; the race of millionaires\nis decaying.\"\n\n\"Is that Ann yonder?\"\n\n\"I think so, from that bent bonnet.\"\n\nIt proved to be Ann, who went by us with the universal bow and\ngrimace, sacrificing to the public spirit with her fine manners. She\nturned soon, however, and overtook us, proposing to make a detour\nto Drummond Street, where an intimate family friend, \"Old Hepburn,\"\nlived, so that the prospect of our going to tea with her might be made\nprobable by her catching a passing glimpse of us; at this time\nshe must be at the window with her Voltaire, or her Rousseau. The\nproposition was accepted, and we soon came near the house, which\nstood behind a row of large trees, and looked very dismal, with\nthree-fourths of its windows barred with board shutters.\n\n\"Walk slow,\" Ann entreated. \"I see her blinking at us. She has not\nshed her satin pelisse yet.\"\n\nBefore we got beyond it a dirty little girl came out of the gate, in\na pair of huge shoes and a canvas apron, which covered her, to call us\nback. Mrs. Hepburn had seen us, and wished us to come in, wanting to\nknow who Miss Adelaide had with her, and to talk with her. She ran\nback, reappearing again at the door, out of breath, and minus a shoe.\nAs we entered a small parlor, an old lady in a black dress, with\na deep cape, held out her withered hand, without rising from her\nstraight-backed arm-chair, smiling at us, but shaking her head\nfuriously at the small girl, who lingered in the door.\n\n\"Mari, Mari,\" she called, but no Mari came, and the small girl took\nour shawls, for Mrs. Hepburn said we must stay, now that she had\ninveigled us inside her doors. Ann mimicked her at her back, but to\nher face behaved servilely. The name of Morgeson belonged to the early\nhistorical time of New England, Mrs. Hepburn informed me. I never\nknew it; but bowed, as if not ignorant. Old Mari must be consulted\nrespecting the sweetmeats, and she went after her.\n\n\"What an old mouser it is!\" said Ann. \"What unexpected ways she has!\nShe scours Belem in her velvet shoes, to find out everybody's history.\nDon't you smell buttered toast?\"\n\n\"Your father is getting the best of the gout,\" said Mrs. Hepburn,\nreturning. \"How is Desmond? He may be the wickedest of you all, but\nI like him the best. I shall not throw away praise of him on you,\nAdelaide.\" And she looked at me.\n\n\"He bows well,\" I said.\n\n\"He resembles his mother, who was a great beauty. Mr. Somers was\nhandsome, too. I was at a ball at Governor Flam's thirty years ago.\nYour mother was barely fifteen, then, Adelaide; she was just married,\nand opened the ball.\"\n\nShe examined me all the while, with a pair of small, round eyes, from\nwhich the color had faded, but which were capable of reading me.\n\nTea was served by candlelight, on a small table. Mrs. Hepburn kept\nher eyes on everything, talking volubly, and pulled the small, girl's\nears, or pushed her by the shoulder, with faith that we were not\nobserving her. The toast was well buttered, the sweetmeats were\ndelicious, and the cake was heavenly, as Ann said. Mrs. Hepburn ate\nlittle, but told us a great deal about marriages in prospect and\nincomes which waxed or waned in consequence. When tea was over, she\nsaid to the small girl who removed the tea things, \"On your life taste\nnot of the cake or the sweetmeats; and bring me two sticks of wood,\nyou huzzy.\" She arranged the sticks on a decaying fire, inside a high\nbrass fender, pulled up a stand near the hearth, lighted two candles,\nand placed on it a pack of cards.\n\n\"Some one may come, so that we can play.\"\n\nMeantime she dozed upright, walking, talking, and dozing again, like a\ncrafty old parrot.\n\n\"She has a great deal of money saved,\" Ann whispered behind a book.\n\"She is over seventy. Oh, she is opening her puss eyes!\"\n\nAdelaide mused, after her fashion, on the slippery hair-cloth sofa,\nlooking at the dim fire, and I surveyed the room. Its aspect attracted\nme, though it was precise and stiff. An ugly Turkey carpet covered\nthe floor; a sideboard was against the wall, with a pair of silver\npitchers on it, and two tall vases, filled with artificial flowers,\nunder glass shades. Old portraits hung over it. Upon one I fixed my\nattention.\n\n\"That is the portrait of Count Rumford,\" Mrs. Hepburn said.\n\n\"Can't we see the letters?\" begged Ann. \"And wont you show us your\ntrinkets? It is three or four years since we looked them over.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, good-humoredly; \"ring the bell.\"\n\nAn old woman answered it, to whom Mrs. Hepburn said, in a friendly\nvoice, \"The box in my desk.\" Adelaide and Ann said, \"How do you\ndo, Mari?\" When she brought the box, Mrs. Hepburn unlocked it, and\nproduced some yellow letters, which we looked over, picking out here\nand there bits of Parisian gossip, many, many years old. They were\ndirected to Cavendish Hepburn, by his friend, the original of the\nportrait. But the letters were soon laid aside, and we examined\nthe contents of the box. Old brooches, miniatures painted on\nivory, silhouettes, hair rings, necklaces, ear-rings, chains, and\nfinger-rings.\n\n\"Did you wear this?\" asked Ann with a longing voice, slipping an\nimmense sapphire ring on her forefinger.\n\n\"In Mr. Hepburn's day,\" she answered, taking up a small case, which\nshe unfastened and gave me. It contained a peculiar pair of ear-rings,\nand a brooch of aqua-marina stones, in a setting perforated like a\nnet.\n\n\"They suit you. Will you accept such an old-fashioned ornament? Put\nthe rings in; here Ann, fasten them.\"\n\nAnn glared at her in astonishment, and then at me, for the reason\nwhich had prompted so unexpected a gift.\n\n\"Is it possible that I am to have them? Why do you give them to me?\nThey are beautiful,\" I replied.\n\n\"They came from Europe long ago,\" she said. \"And they happen to suit\nyou.\"\n\n                'Sabrina fair,\n  Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave,\n  In twisted braids of lilies knitting\n  The loose train of thy amber-dropping hair.'\"\n\n\"Those lines make me forgive Paradise Lost,\" said Adelaide.\n\n\"They are very long, these ear-rings,\" Ann remarked.\n\nI put the brooch in the knot of ribbon I wore; Mrs. Hepburn joggled\nthe white satin bows of her cap in approbation.\n\nThe knocker resounded. \"There is our partner,\" she cried.\n\n\"It must be late, ma'am,\" said Adelaide; \"and I suspect it is some one\nfor us. You know we never venture on impromptu visits, except to you,\nand our people know where to send.\"\n\n\"Late or not, you shall stay for a game,\" she said, as Ben came in,\nhat in hand, declaring he had been scouting for us since dark. Mrs.\nHepburn snuffed the candles, and rang the bell. The small girl, with\na perturbed air, like one hurried out of a nap, brought in a waiter,\nwhich she placed on the sideboard.\n\n\"Get to bed,\" Mrs. Hepburn loudly whispered, looking over the waiter,\nand taking from it a silver porringer, she put it inside the fender,\nand then shuffled the cards.\n\n\"Now, Ann, you may sit beside me and learn.\"\n\n\"If it is whist, mum, I know it. I played every afternoon at Hampton\nlast summer, and we spoiled a nice polished table, we scratched it so\nwith our nails, picking up the cards.\"\n\n\"Young people do too much, nowadays.\"\n\nI was in the shadow of the sideboard; Ben stood against it.\n\n\"When have you played whist, Cassandra?\" he asked in a low voice. \"Do\nyou remember?\"\n\n\"Is my name Cassandra?\"\n\n\"Have you forgotten that, too?\"\n\n\"I remember the rain.\"\n\n\"It is not October, yet.\"\n\n\"And the yellow leaves do not stick to the panes. Would you like to\nsee Helen?\"\n\n\"Come, play with me, Ben,\" called Mrs. Hepburn.\n\n\"Ann, try your skill,\" I entreated, \"and let me off.\"\n\n\"She can try,\" Mrs. Hepburn said sharply. \"Don't you like games? I\nshould have said you were by nature a bold gamester.\" She dealt the\ncards rapidly, and was soon absorbed in the game, though she quarreled\nwith Ann occasionally, and knocked over the candlestick once. Adelaide\nplayed heroically, and was praised, though I knew she hated play.\n\nTwo hours passed before we were released. The fire went out, the\ncandles burnt low, and whatever the contents of the silver porringer,\nthey had long been cold. When Mrs. Hepburn saw us determined to go,\nshe sent us to the sideboard for some refreshment. \"My caudle is\ncold,\" taking off the cover of the porringer. \"Why, Mari, what is\nthis?\" she said, as the woman made a noiseless entrance with a bowl of\nhot caudle.\n\n\"I knew how it would be,\" she answered, putting it into the hands of\nher mistress.\n\n\"I am a desperate old rake, you mean, Mari. There, take your virtue\noff, you appall me.\"\n\nShe poured the caudle into small silver tumblers, and gave them to us.\n\"The Bequest of a Friend\" was engraved on them. Her fingers were like\nice, and her head shook with fatigue; but her voice was sprightly and\nher smile bright. Ann ate a good deal of sponge cake, and omitted the\ncaudle, but I drank mine to the memory of the donor of the cup.\n\n\"You know that sherry, Ben,\" and Mrs. Hepburn nodded him toward a\ndecanter. He put his hand on it, and took it away. \"None to-night,\"\nhe said. Mari came with our shawls, and we hastened away, hearing her\nshoot the bolt of the door behind us. Ben drew my arm in his, and the\ngirls walked rapidly before us. It was a white, hazy night, and the\nmoon was wallowing in clouds.\n\n\"Let us walk off the flavor of Hep's cards,\" said Adelaide, \"and go to\nWolf's Point.\"\n\n\"Do you wish to go?\" he asked me.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nAnn skipped. A nocturnal excursion suited her exactly.\n\n\"You are not to have the toothache to-morrow, or pretend to be lame,\"\nsaid Adelaide.\n\n\"Not another hiss, Adder. _En avant!_\"\n\nWe passed down Norfolk Street, now dark and silent, and reached our\nhouse. A light was burning in a room in the third story, and a\nwindow was open. Desmond sat by it, his arms folded across his chest,\nsmoking, and contemplating some object beyond our view. Ann derisively\napostrophized him, under her breath, while Ben unlocked the court gate\nand went in after Rash, who came out quietly, and we proceeded. In\nlooking behind me, I stumbled.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he asked. \"Are you afraid?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Of what?\"\n\n\"The Prince of Darkness.\"\n\n\"The devil lives a little behind us.\"\n\n\"In you, too, then?\"\n\n\"In Rash. Look at him; he is bigger than Faust's dog, jumps higher,\nand is blacker. You can't hear the least sound from him as he gambols\nwith his familiar.\"\n\nWe left the last regular street on that side of the city, and entered\na road, bordered by trees and bushes, which hid the country from us.\nWe crept through a gap in it, crossed two or three spongy fields,\nand ascended a hill, reaching an abrupt edge of the rocks, over whose\nearthy crest we walked. Below it I saw a strip of the sea, hemmed in\non all sides, for the light was too vague for me to see its narrow\noutlet. It looked milky, misty, and uncertain; the predominant shores\nstifled its voice, if it ever had one. Adelaide and Ann crouched\nover the edge of the rock, reciting, in a chanting tone, from a poem\nbeginning:\n\n  \"The river of thy thoughts must keep\n  its solemn course too still and deep\n  For idle eyes to see.\"\n\nTheir false intonation of voice and the wordy spirit of the poem\nconvinced me that poetry with them was an artificial taste. I turned\naway. The dark earth and the rolling sky were better. Ben followed.\n\n\"I hope Veronica's letter will come to-morrow,\" he said with a groan.\n\n\"Veronica! Why Veronica?\"\n\n\"Don't torment me.\"\n\n\"She writes letters seldom.\"\n\n\"I have written her.\"\n\n\"She has never written me.\"\n\n\"It might be the means of revealing you to each other to do so.\"\n\n\"Ben, your native air is deleterious.\"\n\n\"You laugh. I feel what you say. I do not attempt to play the\nmissionary at home, for my field is not here.\"\n\n\"You were wise not to bring Veronica, I see already.\"\n\n\"She would see what I hate myself for.\"\n\n\"One may venture farther with a friend than a lover.\"\n\n\"I thought that _you_ might understand the results of my associations.\nCurse them all! Come, girls, we must go back.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\n\nI took a cold that night. Belem was damp always, but its midnight damp\nwas worse than any other. Mrs. Somers sent me medicine. Adelaide asked\nme, with an air of contemplation, what made me sick, and felt her own\npulse. Ann criticised my nightgown ruffles, and accused me of wearing\nimitation lace; but nursing was her forte, and she stayed by me,\nannoying me by a frequent beating up of my pillow, and the bringing\nin of bowls of strange mixtures for me to swallow, which she persuaded\nthe cook to make and her father to taste.\n\nBefore I left my room, Mrs. Somers came to see me.\n\n\"You are about well, I hear,\" she said, in a cold voice.\n\nI felt as if I had been shamming sickness.\n\n\"I thought you were in remarkable health, your frame is so large.\"\n\nAdelaide was there, and answered for me. \"You _are_ delicate. It must\nbe because you do not take care of yourself.\"\n\n\"Wolf's Point to be avoided, perhaps!\"\n\n\"I have walked to Wolf's Point for fifteen years, night and day, many\ntimes.\"\n\n\"Mr. Munster's man left this note for you,\" her mother said, handing\nit to her.\n\nShe read an invitation from Miss Munster, a cousin, to a small party.\n\n\"You will not be able to go,\" Mrs. Somers remarked to me.\n\n\"You will go,\" Adelaide said; \"it is an attention to you altogether.\"\n\nShe never replied to her mother, never asked her any questions, so\nthat talking between them was a one-sided affair.\n\n\"Let us go out shopping, Adelaide; I want some lace to wear,\" I\nbegged.\n\nMrs. Somers looked into her drawers, out of which Adelaide had thrust\nher finery, and found mine, but said nothing.\n\n\"We are going to a party, Ann. Thanks to your messes and your\nnursing,\" as I passed her in the hall.\n\n\"Where is your evening dress?\"\n\n\"Pinned in a napkin--like my talent.\"\n\n\"Old Cousin Munster, the pirate, who made his money in the opium\ntrade, has good things in his house. I suppose,\" with a coquettish\nair, \"that you will see Ned Munster; he _would_ walk to the door with\nme to-day. He wishes me out, I know.\"\n\nWe consumed that evening in talking of dress. Adelaide showed me her\ncamel's-hair scarfs which Desmond had brought, and her dresses. Ann\ntried them all on, walking up and down, and standing tiptoe before the\nglass, while I trimmed a handkerchief with the lace I had purchased. I\nunfolded my dress after they were gone, with a dubious mind. It was\na heavy white silk, with a blue satin stripe. It might be too\nold-fashioned, for it belonged to mother, who would never wear it.\nThe sleeves were puffed with bands of blue velvet, and the waist was\ncovered with a berth\u00c3\u00a9 of the same. It must do, however, for I had no\nother.\n\nWe were to go at nine. Adelaide came to my room dressed, and with\nher hair arranged exactly like mine. She looked well, in spite of her\nMongolic face.\n\n\"Pa wants to see us in his room; he has gone to bed.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" I begged. I took my hair down, unbraided it, brushed\nit out of curl as much as I could, twisted it into a loose mass,\nthrough which I stuck pins enough to hold it, bound a narrow fillet of\nred velvet round my head, and ran after her.\n\n\"That is much better,\" she said; \"you are entirely changed.\" Desmond\nwas there, in his usual careless dress, hanging over the footboard of\nthe bed, and Ann was huddled on the outside. Mrs. Somers was reading.\n\n\"Pa,\" said Ann, \"just think of Old Hepburn's giving her a pair of\nlovely ear-rings.\"\n\n\"Did she? Where are they?\" asked Mrs. Somers.\n\n\"I am not surprised,\" said Mr. Somers. \"Mrs. Hepburn knows where to\nbestow. Why not wear them?\"\n\n\"I'll get them,\" said Ann.\n\nMr. Somers continued his compliments. He thought there was a pleasing\ncontrast between Adelaide and myself, referred to Diana, mentioned\nthat my hair was remarkably thick, and proceeded with a dissertation\non the growth and decay of the hair, when she returned with the\near-rings.\n\n\"It is too dark here,\" she said.\n\nDesmond, who had remained silent, took the candle, which Mrs. Somers\nwas reading by, and held it for Ann, close to my face. The operation\nwas over, but the candle was not taken away till Mrs. Somers asked for\nit sharply.\n\n\"I dare say,\" murmured Mr. Somers, who was growing drowsy, \"that Mrs.\nHepburn wore them some night, when she went to John Munster's, forty\nyears ago, and now you wear them to the son's. How things come round!\"\n\nThe Munsters' man opened the door for us.\n\nThe rooms were full. \"Very glad,\" said Mr., Mrs., and Miss Munster,\nand amid a loud buzz we fell back into obscurity. Adelaide joined\na group, who were talking at the top of their voices, with most\nhilarious countenances.\n\n\"They pretend to have a Murillo here, let us go and find it,\" said\nBen.\n\nIt was in a small room. While we looked at a dark-haired, handsome\nwoman, standing on brown clouds, with hands so fat that every finger\nstood apart, Miss Munster brought up a young gentleman with the\nMunster cast of countenance.\n\n\"My brother begs an introduction, Miss Morgeson.\"\n\nBen retired, and Mr. Munster began to talk volubly, with wandering\neyes, repeating words he was in danger of forgetting. No remarks were\nrequired from me. At the proper moment he asked me to make the tour\nof the rooms, and offered his arm. As we were crossing the hall, I saw\nDesmond, hat in hand, and in faultless evening dress, bowing to Miss\nMunster.\n\n\"Your Cousin Desmond, and mine, is a fine-looking man, is he not? Let\nus speak to him.\"\n\nI drew back. \"I'll not interrupt his _devoir_.\"\n\nHe bowed submissively.\n\n\"My cousin Desmond,\" I thought; \"let me examine this beauty.\" He was\nhandsomer than Ben, his complexion darker, and his hair black. There\nwas a flush across his cheek-bones, as if he had once blushed, and the\nblush had settled. The color of his eyes I could not determine. As if\nto resolve my doubt, he came toward us; they were a deep violet,\nand the lids were fringed with long black lashes. I speculated on\nsomething animal in those eyes. He stood beside me, and twisted his\nheavy mustache.\n\n\"What a pretty boudoir this is,\" I said, backing into a little room\nbehind us.\n\n\"Ned,\" he said abruptly, \"you must resign Miss Morgeson; I am here to\nsee her.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Ned answered; \"I relinquish.\"\n\nBefore a word was spoken between us, Mrs. Munster touched Desmond\non the shoulder, and told him that he must come with her, to be\nintroduced to Count Montholon.\n\n\"Bring him here, please.\"\n\n\"Tyrant,\" she answered playfully, \"the Count shall come.\"\n\nHe brought a chair. \"Take this; you are pale. You have been ill.\"\nBringing another, he seated himself before me and fanned himself with\nhis hat.\n\nMrs. Munster came back with the Count, an elderly man, and Desmond\nrose to meet him, keeping his hand on the back of his chair. They\nspoke French. The freedom of their conversation precluded the idea\nof my understanding it. The Count made a remark about me. Desmond\nreplied, glancing at me, and both pulled their mustaches. The Count\nwas called away soon, and Desmond resumed his chair.\n\n\"I understood you,\" I said.\n\n\"The deuce you did.\"\n\nHe placed his hat over a vase of flowers, which tipping over, he\nleisurely righted, and bending toward me, said:\n\n\"It was in battle.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And women like you, pure, with no vice of blood, sometimes are\ntempted, struggle, and suffer.\"\n\nHis words, still more his voice, made we wince.\n\n\"Even drawn battles bring their scars,\" I replied.\n\n\"Convince me beyond all doubt that a woman can reason with her\nimpulses, or even fathom them, and I will be in your debt.\"\n\n\"Maybe--but Ben is coming.\"\n\nHe looked at me strangely.\n\n\"You must find this very dull, Cassandra,\" said Ben, joining us.\n\n\"_Cassandra_,\" said Desmond, \"are you bored?\"\n\nThe accent with which he spoke my name set my pulses striking like a\nclock. I got up mechanically, as Ben directed.\n\n\"They are going to supper. There's game. Des. Munster told me to take\nthe northeast corner of the table.\"\n\n\"I shall take the southwest, then,\" he replied, nodding to a tall\ngentleman who passed with Adelaide. When we left him, he was observing\na carved oak chair, in occult sympathy probably with the grain of\nthe wood. Nature strikes us with _her_ phenomena at times when other\nresources are not at hand.\n\nWe were compelled to wait at the door of the supper-room, the jam was\nso great.\n\n\"What fairy story do you like best?\" asked Ben\n\n\"I know which you like.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Bluebeard. You have an affinity with Sister Ann in the tower.\"\n\n\"Do you think I see nothing 'but the sun which makes a dust and the\ngrass which looks green?' I believe you like Bluebeard, too.\"\n\nThat was a great joke, at which we both laughed.\n\nWhen I saw Desmond again, he was surrounded by men, the French Count\namong them, drinking champagne. He held a bottle, and was talking\nfast. The others were laughing. His listless, morose expression had\ndisappeared; in the place of a brutal-tempered, selfish, bored man, I\nsaw a brilliant, jovial gentleman. Which was the real man?\n\n\"Finish your jelly,\" said Ben.\n\n\"I prefer looking at your brother.\"\n\n\"Leave my brother alone.\"\n\n\"You see nothing but 'the sun which makes a dust, and the grass which\nlooks green.'\"\n\nMiss Munster hoped I was cared for. How gay Desmond was! she had not\nseen such a look in his face in a long time. And how strongly he was\nmarked with the family traits.\n\n\"How am I marked, May?\" asked Ben.\n\n\"Oh, we know worse eccentrics than you are. What are you up to now?\nYou are not as frank as Desmond.\"\n\nHe laughed as he looked at me, and then Adelaide called to us that it\nwas time to leave.\n\nWe were among the last; the carriage was waiting. We made our bows to\nMrs. Munster, who complained of not having seen more of us. \"You are\na favorite of Mrs. Hepburn's, Miss Morgeson, I am told. She is a\nremarkable woman, has great powers.\" I mentioned my one interview with\nher. Guests were going upstairs with smiles, and coming down without,\nreleased from their company manners. We rode home in silence, except\nthat Adelaide yawned fearfully, and then we toiled up the long stairs,\nseparating with a tired, \"good-night.\"\n\nI extinguished my candle by dropping my shawl upon it, and groped in\nvain for matches over the tops of table and shelf.\n\n\"To bed in the dark, then,\" I said, pulling off my gloves and the\nband, from my head, for I felt a tightness in it, and pulled out\nthe hairpins. But a desire to look in the glass overcame me. I felt\nunacquainted with myself, and must see what my aspect indicated just\nthen.\n\nI crept downstairs, to the dining-room, passed my hands over the\nsideboard, the mantel shelf, and took the round of the dinner-table,\nbut found nothing to light my candle with.\n\n\"The fire may not be out in the parlor,\" I thought; \"it can be lighted\nthere.\" I ran against the hatstand in the hall, knocking a cane down,\nwhich fell with a loud noise. The parlor door was ajar; the fire was\nnot out, and Desmond was before it, watching its decay.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked.\n\n\"The candle,\" I stammered, confused with the necessity of staying to\nhave it lighted, and the propriety of retreating in the dark.\n\n\"Shall I light it?\"\n\nI stepped a little further inside the door and gave it to him. He\ngrew warm with thrusting it between the bars of the grate, and I grew\nchilly. Shivering, and with chattering teeth, I made out to say, \"A\npiece of paper would do it.\" Raising his head hastily, it came crash\nagainst the edge of the marble shelf. Involuntarily I shut the door,\nand leaned against it, to wait for the effect of the blow; but feeling\na pressure against the outside, I yielded to it, and moved aside. Mrs.\nSomers entered, with a candle flaring in one hand, and holding with\nthe other her dressing-gown across her bosom.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" she asked harshly, but in a whisper, her\neyes blazing like a panther's.\n\n\"Doing?\" I replied; \"stay and see.\"\n\nShe swept along, and I followed, bringing up close to Desmond, who had\nhis hand round his head, and was very pale, either from the effect\nof the blow or some other cause. Even the flush across his cheeks had\nfaded. She looked at him sharply; he moved his hands from his head,\nand met her eyes. \"I am not drunk, you see,\" he said in a low voice.\nShe made an insulting gesture toward me, which meant, \"Is this an\nadventure of yours?\"\n\nThe blaze in her eyes kindled a more furious one in his; he stepped\nforward with a threatening motion.\n\nAnger raged through me--like a fierce rain that strikes flat a violent\nsea. I laid my hand on her arm, which she snapped at like a wolf, but\nI spoke calmly:\n\n\"You tender, true-hearted creature, full of womanly impulses, allow me\nto light my candle by yours!\"\n\nI picked it from the hearth, lighted it, and held it close to her\nface, laughing, though I never felt less merry. But I had restrained\nhim.\n\nHe took the candle away gently.\n\n\"Leave the room,\" he said to her.\n\nShe beckoned me to go.\n\n\"No, you shall go.\"\n\nThey made a simultaneous movement with their hands, he to insist, she\nto deprecate, and I again observed how exactly alike they were.\n\n\"_Desmond_,\" I implored, \"pray allow me to go.\"\n\nA deep flush suffused his face. He bowed, threw wide the door, and\nfollowed me to the foot of the stairs. I reached my hand for the\ncandle, for he retained both.\n\n\"You, pardon first.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"For much? oh--for much.\"\n\nWhat story my face told, I could not have told him. He kissed my hand\nand turned away.\n\nAt the top of the stairs I looked down. He was there with upturned\nface, watching me. Whether he went back to confer with his mother,\nI never knew; if he did, the expression which he wore then must have\ntroubled her. I went to bed, wondering over the mischief that a candle\ncould do. After I had extinguished it, its wick glowed in the dark\nlike a one-eyed demon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\n\nAnother week passed. Ben had received a letter from Veronica,\ninforming him that letter-writing was a kind of composition she was\nnot fond of. He must come to her, and then there would be no need for\nwriting. Her letter exasperated him. His tenacious mind, lying in wait\nto close upon hers, was irritated by her simple, candid behavior. I\ncould give him no consolation, nor did I care to. It suited me that\nhis feelings for her weakened his penetration in regard to me.\n\nWhen he roused at the expression which he saw Desmond fix upon me the\nnight that Major Millard was there, I expected a rehearsal from him of\nwatchfulness and suspicion; but no symptom appeared. I was glad, for\nI was in love with Desmond. I had known it from the night of Miss\nMunster's party. The morning after I woke to know my soul had built\nitself a lordly pleasure-house; its dome and towers were firm and\nfinished, glowing in the light that \"never was on land or sea.\" How\nelate I grew in this atmosphere! The face of Nemesis was veiled even.\nNo eye saw the pure, pale nimbus ringed above it. I did not see\n_him_, except as an apparition, for suddenly he had become the most\nunobtrusive member of the family, silent and absent. Immunity from\nespionage was the immutable family rule. Mrs. Somers, under the\ndirection of that spirit which isolated me from all exterior\ninfluences, for a little time had shut down the lid of her evil\nfeelings, and was quiet; watching me, perhaps, but not annoying. Mr.\nSomers was engaged with the subject of ventilation. Ann, to convince\nherself that she had a musical talent, practiced of afternoons till\nshe was turned out by Adelaide, who had a fit of reading abstruse\nworks, sometimes seeking me with fingers thrust between their leaves\nto hold abstract conversations, which, though I took small part in\nthem, were of service.\n\nThat portion of the world of emotions which I was mapping out she\nwas profoundly indifferent to. My experiences to her would have been\ndebasing. As she would not come to me, I went to her, and gained\nsomething.\n\nBen, always a favorite with his father, pursued him, rode with him,\nand made visits of pleasure or business, with a latent object which\nkept him on the alert.\n\nI had been in Belem three weeks; in a week more I decided to return\nhome. My indignation against Mrs. Somers, from our midnight interview,\nhad not suggested that I should shorten my visit. On the contrary, it\nhad freed me from any regard or fear of her opinion. I had discovered\nher limits.\n\nIt was Saturday afternoon. Reflecting that I had but a few days more\nfor Belem, and summing up the events of my visit and the people I had\nmet, their fashions and differences, I unrolled a tolerable panorama,\nwith patches in it of vivid color, and laid it away in my memory, to\nbe unrolled again at some future time. Then a faint shadow dropped\nacross my mind like a curtain, the first that clouded my royal palace,\nmy mental paradise!\n\nI sighed. Joyless, vacant, barren hours prefigured themselves to me,\ndrifting through my brain, till their vacant shapes crowded it into\ndarkness. I must do something! I would go out; a walk would be good\nfor me. Moreover, wishing to purchase a parting gift for Adelaide and\nAnn, I would go alone. Wandering from shop to shop in Norfolk Street,\nwithout finding the articles I desired, I turned into a street which\ncrossed it, and found the right shop. Seeing Drummond Street on an old\ngable-end house, a desire to exchange with some one a language which\ndiffered from my thoughts prompted me to look up Mrs. Hepburn. I soon\ncame to her house, and knocked at the door, which Mari opened. The\ncurrent was already changed, as I followed her into a room different\nfrom the one where I had seen Mrs. Hepburn. It was dull of aspect,\nlong and narrow, with one large window opening on the old-fashioned\ngarden, and from which I saw a discolored marble Flora. Mrs. Hepburn\nwas by the window, in her high chair. She held out her hand and\nthanked me for coming to see an old woman. Motioning her head toward a\ndark corner, she said, \"There is a young man who likes occasionally to\nvisit an old woman also.\"\n\nThe young man, twenty-nine years old, was Desmond. He crossed the\nroom and offered me his hand. We had not spoken since we parted at\nthe stairs that memorable night. He hastily brought chairs, and placed\nthem near Mrs. Hepburn, who seized her spectacles, which were on a\nsilk workbag beside her, scanned us through them, and exclaimed, \"Ah\nha! what is this?\"\n\n\"Is it something in me, ma'am?\" said Desmond, putting his head before\nmy face so that it was hid from her.\n\n\"Something in both of you; thief! thief!\"\n\nShe rubbed her frail hand against my sleeve, muttering, \"See now,\nso!--the same characteristics.\"\n\n\"I spoke of the difference of the rooms; the one we were in reminded\nme of a lizard! The walls were faint gray, and every piece of\nfurniture was covered with plain yellow chintz, while the carpet was\na pale green. She replied that she always moved from her winter parlor\nto this summer room on the twenty-second day of April, which had\nfallen the day before, for she liked to watch the coming out of the\nshrubs in the garden, which were as old as herself. The chestnut had\nleaved seventy times and more; and the crippled plum, whose fruit was\nso wormy to eat, was dying with age. As for the elms at the bottom of\nthe garden, for all she knew they were a thousand years old.\n\n\"The elms are a thousand years old,\" I repeated and repeated to\nmyself, while she glided from topic to topic with Desmond, whose\nconversation indicated that he was as cultivated as any ordinary\ngentleman, when the Pickersgill element was not apparent. The form of\nthe garden-goddess faded, the sun had gone below the garden wall. The\ngarden grew dusk, and the elms began to nod their tops at me. I became\nsilent, listening to the fall of the plummet, which dropped again\nand again from the topmost height of that lordly domain, over which\nshadows had come. Were they sounding its foundations?\n\nMy eyes roved the garden, seeking the nucleus of an emotion which\nbeset me now--not they, but my senses, formed it--in a garden miles\naway, where nodded a row of elms, under which _Charles Morgeson_\nstood.\n\n\"_I am glad you're here, my darling, do you smell the roses?_\"\n\n\"Are you going?\" I heard Mrs. Hepburn say in a far-off voice. I was\nstanding by the door.\n\n\"Yes, madam; the summer parlor does not delay the sunset.\"\n\n\"Come again. When do you leave Belem?\"\n\n\"In few days.\"\n\nDesmond made a grimace, and went to the window.\n\n\"Who returns with you,\" she continued, \"Ben? He likes piloting.\"\n\n\"I hope he will; I came here to please him.\"\n\n\"Pooh! You came here because Mr. Somers had a crotchet.\"\n\n\"Well; I was permitted somehow to come.\"\n\n\"It was perfectly right. A woman like you need not question whether a\nthing is convenable.\"\n\nDesmond turned from the window, and bestowed upon her a benign smile,\nwhich she returned with a satisfied nod.\n\nThis implied flattery tinkled pleasantly on my ears, allaying a doubt\nwhich I suffered from. Did I realize how much the prestige of those\nBelem saints influenced me, or how proud I was with the conviction of\naffiliation with those who were plainly marked with Caste?\n\n\"Walk with me,\" he demanded, as we were going down the steps.\n\nWe passed out of Drummond Street into a wide open common. Rosy clouds\nfloated across the zenith, and a warm, balmy wind was blowing. I\nthought of Veronica, calm and happy, as the spring always made her,\nand the thought was a finishing blow to the variety of moods I had\npassed through. The helm of my will was broken.\n\n\"There is a good view from Moss Hill yonder,\" he said. \"Shall we go\nup?\"\n\nI bowed, declining his arm, and trudged beside him. From its summit\nBelem was only half in sight. Its old, crooked streets sloped and\ndisappeared from view; Wolf's Point was at the right of us, and its\nthread of sea. I began talking of our walk, and was giving an extended\ndescription of it, when he abruptly asked why I came to Belem.\n\n\"I know,\" he said, \"that you would not have come, had there been any\nsentiment between you and Ben.\"\n\n\"Thanks for your implication. But I must have made the visit, you\nknow, or how could I learn that I should not have made it?\"\n\n\"You regret coming?\"\n\n\"Veronica will give me no thanks.\"\n\n\"Who is she?\"\n\n\"My sister, whom Ben loves.\"\n\n\"Ben love a sister of yours? My God--how? when first? where? And how\ncame you to meet him?\"\n\n\"That chapter of accidents need not be recounted. Can you help him?\"\n\n\"What can I do?\" he said roughly. \"There is little love between us.\nYou know what a devil's household ours is; but he is one of us--he is\nafraid.\"\n\n\"Of what?\"\n\n\"Of mother--of our antecedents--of himself.\"\n\n\"I could not expect you to speak well of him.\"\n\n\"Of course not. Your sister has no fortune?\"\n\n\"She has not. Men whose merchandise is ships are apt to die bankrupt.\"\n\n\"Your father is a merchant?\"\n\n\"Even at that, the greatest of the name.\n\n\"We are all tied up, you know. Ben's allowance is smaller than mine.\nHe is easy about money; therefore he is pa's favorite.\"\n\n\"Why do you not help yourselves?\"\n\n\"Do you think so? You have not known us long. Have you influenced Ben\nto help himself?\"\n\nI marched down the hill without reply. Repassing Mrs. Hepburn's, he\nsaid, \"My grandfather was an earl's son.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Hepburn likes you for that. My grandfather was a tailor; I\nshould have told her so, when she gave me the aqua marina jewels.\"\n\n\"Had you the courage?\"\n\n\"I forgot both the fact and the courage.\"\n\nI hurried along, for it grew dark, and presently saw Ben on the steps\nof the house.\n\n\"Have you been walking?\" he asked.\n\n\"It looks so. Yes, with me,\" answered Desmond. \"Wont you give me\nthanks for attention to your friend?\"\n\n\"It must have been a whim of Cassandra's.\"\n\n\"Break her of whims, if you can--\"\n\n\"I _will_.\"\n\nWe went into the parlor together.\n\n\"Where do you think I have been?\" Ben asked.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"For the doctor. The _baby_ is sick\"; and he looked hard at Desmond.\n\n\"I hope it will live for years and years,\" I said.\n\n\"I know what you are at, Ben,\" said Desmond. \"I have wished the brat\ndead; but upon my soul, I have a stronger wish than that--I have\n_forgotten_ it.\"\n\nThere was no falseness in his voice; he spoke the truth.\n\n\"Forgive me, Des.\"\n\n\"No matter about that,\" he answered, sauntering off.\n\nI felt happier; that spark of humanity warmed me. I might not have\nanother. \"I would,\" I said, \"that the last day, the last moments of my\nvisit had come. You will see me henceforth in Surrey. I will live and\ndie there.\"\n\n\"To-night,\" Ben said, \"I am going to tell pa.\"\n\n\"That is best.\"\n\n\"Horrible atmosphere!\"\n\n\"It would kill Verry.\"\n\n\"You thrive in it,\" he said, with a spice of irritation in his voice.\n\n\"Thrive!\"\n\nAdelaide and Ann proved gracious over my gift. They were talking of\nthe doctor's visit. Ann said the child was teething, for she had\nfelt its gums; nothing else was the matter. There need be no\n_apprehension_. She should say so to Desmond and Ben, and would post a\nletter to her brother in unknown parts.\n\n\"Miss Hiticutt has sent for us to come over to tea,\" Adelaide informed\nme. The black silk I wore would do, for we must go at once.\n\nThe quiet, formal evening was a pleasant relief, although I was\ntroubled with a desire to inform Mrs. Somers of Ben's engagement, for\nthe sake of exasperating her. We came home too early for bed, Adelaide\nsaid; beside, she had music-hunger. I must sing. Mrs. Somers was by\nthe fire, darning fine napkins, winking over her task, maintaining\nin her aspect the determination to avert any danger of a midnight\ninterview with Desmond. That gentleman was at present sleeping on a\nsofa. I seated myself before the piano, wondering whether he slept\nfrom wine, ennui, or to while away the time till I should come. I\ntouched the keys softly, waiting for an interpreting voice, and half\nunconsciously sang the lines of Schiller:\n\n  \"I hear the sound of music, and the halls\n  Are full of light. Who are the revelers?\"\n\nDesmond made an inarticulate noise and sprang up, as if in answer to a\ncall. A moment after he stepped quietly over the back of the sofa\nand stood bending over me. I looked up. His eyes were clear, his face\nalive with intuition. Though Adelaide was close by, she was oblivious;\nher eyes were cast upward and her fingers lay languid in her lap. Ann,\nmore lively, introduced a note here and there into my song to her own\nsatisfaction. Mrs. Somers I could not see; but I stopped and, giving\nthe music stool a turn, faced her. She met me with her pale, opaque\nstare, and began to swing her foot over her knee; her slipper, already\ndown at her heel, fell off. I picked it up in spite of her negative\nmovement and hung it on the foot again.\n\n\"I shall speak with you presently,\" she whispered, glancing at\nDesmond.\n\nHe heard her and his face flashed with the instinct of sport, which\nmade me ashamed of any desire for a struggle with her.\n\n\"Good-night,\" I said abruptly, turning away.\n\n\"We are all sleepy except this exemplary housewife with her napkins,\"\ncried Ann. \"We will leave her.\"\n\n\"Cassandra,\" said Adelaide, when we were on the stairs, \"how well you\nlook!\"\n\nAnn, elevating her candle, remarked my eyes shone like a cat's.\n\n\"Hiticutt's tea was too strong,\" added Adelaide; \"it dilates the\npupils. I am sorry you are going away,\" and she kissed me; this favor\nwould have moved me at any other time, but now I rejoiced to see her\ndepart and leave me alone. I sat down by the toilet table and was\narranging some bottles, when Mrs. Somers rustled in. Out of breath,\nshe began haughtily:\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nA lethargic feeling crept over me; my thoughts wandered; I never spoke\nnor stirred till she pulled my sleeve violently.\n\n\"If you touch me it will rouse me. Did a child of yours ever inflict a\nblow upon you?\"\n\nShe turned purple with rage, looming up before my vision like a peony.\n\n\"When are you going home?\"\n\nI counted aloud, \"Sunday--Monday,\" and stopped at Wednesday. \"Ben is\ngoing back with me.\"\n\n\"_He_ may go.\"\n\n\"And not Desmond?\"\n\n\"Do you know Desmond?\"\n\n\"Not entirely.\"\n\n\"He has played with such toys as you are, and broken them.\"\n\n\"Alas, he is hereditarily cruel! Could _I_ expect not to be broken?\"\n\nShe caught up a glass goblet as if to throw it, but only grasped it so\ntight that it shivered. \"There goes one of the Pickersgill treasures,\nI am sure,\" I thought.\n\n\"I am already scarred, you see. I have been 'nurtured in\nconvulsions.'\"\n\nThe action seemed to loosen her speech; but she had to nerve herself\nto say what she intended; for some reason or other, she could not\nremain as angry as she wished. What she said I will not repeat.\n\n\"Madam, I have no plans. If I have a Purpose, it is formless yet. If\nGod saves us what can you do?\"\n\nShe made a gesture of contempt.\n\n\"You have no soul to thank me for what may be my work,\" and I opened\nthe door.\n\nBen stood on the threshhold.\n\n\"In God's name, what is this?\"\n\nI pointed to his mother. She looked uneasy, and stepping forward put\nher hand on his arm; but he shook her off.\n\n\"You may call me a fool, Cassandra, for bringing you here,\" he said in\na bitter voice, \"besides calling me cruel for subjecting you to these\nordeals. I knew how it would be with mother. What is it, madam?\" he\nasked imperiously, looking so much like her that I shuddered.\n\n\"It is not you she is after,\" she hotly exclaimed.\n\n\"No, I should think not.\" And he led her out swiftly.\n\nI heard Mrs. Somers say at breakfast, as I went in, \"We are to lose\nMiss Cassandra on Wednesday.\" I looked at Desmond, who was munching\ntoast abstractedly. He made a motion for me to take the chair beside\nhim, which I obeyed. Ben saw this movement, and an expression of pain\npassed over his face. At that instant I remembered that Desmond's\nbeing seen in the evening and in the morning was a rare occurrence.\nMr. Somers took up the remark of Mrs. Somers where she had left it,\nand expatiated on it till breakfast was over, so courteously and so\nramblingly that I was convinced the affair Ben had at heart had been\nrevealed. He invited me to go to church, and he spent the whole of the\nevening in the parlor; and although Desmond hovered near me all day\nand all the evening, we had no opportunity of speaking to each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\n\nOn Tuesday morning Adelaide sent out invitations to a farewell\nentertainment, as she called it, for Tuesday evening. Mrs. Somers,\naffecting great interest in it, engaged my services in wiping the\ndust from glass and china; \"too valuable,\" she said, \"for servants to\nhandle.\" We spent a part of the morning in the dining-room and pantry.\nAnn was with us. If she went out, Mrs. Somers was silent; when present\nshe chatted. While we were busy Desmond came in, in riding trousers\nand whip in hand.\n\n\"What nonsense!\" he said, touching my hand with the whiplash. \"Will\nyou ride with me after dinner?\"\n\n\"I must have the horses at three o'clock,\" said his mother, \"to go to\nMrs. Flint's funeral. She was a family friend, you know.\" The funeral\ncould not be postponed, even for Desmond; but he grew ill-humored at\nonce, swore at Murphy, who was packing a waiter at the sideboard, for\nrattling the plates; called Ann a minx, because she laughed at him;\nand bit a cigar to pieces because he could not light it. Rash had\nfollowed him, his nose against his velveteens, in entreaty to go with\nhim; I was pleased at this sign of amity between them. At a harder\npush than common he looked down and kicked him away.\n\n\"Noble creature,\" I said, \"try your whip on him. Rash, go to your\nmaster,\" and I opened the door. Two smaller dogs, Desmond's property,\nmade a rush to come in; but I shut them out, whereat they whined so\nloudly that Mrs. Somers was provoked to attack him for bringing his\ndogs in the house. An altercation took place, and was ended by Desmond\ndeclaring that he was on his way after a bitch terrier, to bring it\nhome. He went out, giving me a look from the door, which I answered\nwith a smile that made him stamp all the way through the hall. Mrs.\nSomers's feelings as she heard him peeped out at me. Groaning in\nspirit, I finished my last saucer and betook myself to my room and\nread, till summoned by Mrs. Somers to a consultation respecting the\nfurniture coverings. Desmond came home, but spoke to no one, hovering\nin my vicinity as on the day before.\n\nIn the afternoon Adelaide and I went in the carriage to make calls\nupon those we did not expect to see in the evening. She wrote P.P.C.\non my cards and laughed at the idea of paying farewell visits to\nstrangers. The last one was made to Mrs. Hepburn. A soft melancholy\ncrept over me when I entered the room where I had met Desmond last. We\nshould probably not see each other alone again. Mrs. Somers's policy\nto that effect would be a success, for I should make no opposition to\nit. Not a word of my feelings could I speak to Mrs. Hepburn--Adelaide\nwas there--provided I had the impulse; and Mrs. Hepburn would be the\nlast to forgive me should I make the conventional mistake of a scene\nor an aside. This old lady had taught me something. I went to the\nwindow, curious to know whether any nerve of association would vibrate\nagain. Nothing stirred me; the machinery which had agitated and\ncontrolled me was effete.\n\nMrs. Hepburn said, as we were taking leave:\n\n\"If you come to Belem next year, and I am above the sod, I invite you\nto pass a month with me. But let it be in the summer. I ride then, and\nshould like you for a companion.\"\n\nShe might have seen irresolution in me, for she added quickly, \"You\nneed not promise--let time decide,\" and shook my hands kindly.\n\n\"Hep, is smitten with you, in her selfish way,\" Adelaide remarked, as\nwe rode from the door. She ordered the coachman to drive home by the\n\"Leslie House,\" which she wanted me to see. A great aunt had lived\nand died there, leaving the house--one of the oldest in Belem--to her\nbrother Ned.\n\n\"Who is he like?\"\n\n\"Desmond; but worse. There's only a year's difference in their ages.\nThey were educated together, kept in the nursery till they were great\nboys and tyrants, and then sent abroad. They were in Amiens three\nyears.\"\n\n\"There are Desmond and Ben; they are walking in the street we are\npassing.\"\n\nShe looked out.\n\n\"They are quarreling, I dare say. Ben is a prig, and preaches to Des.\"\n\nWhile we were in the house, and Adelaide talked with the old servant\nof her aunt, my thoughts were occupied with Desmond. What had they\nquarreled on? Desmond was pale, and laughed; but Ben was red, and\nlooked angry.\n\n\"Why do you look at me so fixedly?\" Adelaide asked, when we were in\nthe carriage again.\n\nIt was on my tongue to say, \"Because I am beset.\" I did not, however;\ninstead I asked her if she never noticed what a rigid look people wore\nin their best bonnets, and holding a card-case? She said, \"Yes,\" and\nshook out her handkerchief, as if to correct her own rigidity.\n\nAfter an early tea she compelled me to sing, and we delayed dressing\ntill Mrs. Somers bloomed in, with purple satin and feather head-dress.\n\n\"Now we must go,\" she said, \"and get ready.\"\n\n\"What shall you wear?\" Mrs. Somers asked, advising a certain ugly,\nclaret-colored silk.\n\n\"Be sure not,\" said Adelaide on the stairs. \"That dress makes your\nhair too yellow.\"\n\nI heard loud laughing in the third story, and heavy steps, while I\nwas in my room; and when I went down, I saw two gentlemen in evening\ndress, standing by Desmond, at the piano, and singing, \"_Fill, fill\nthe sparkling brimmer_.\" They were, as Ann informed me, college\nfriends of Des, who had arrived for a few days' visit, she supposed;\ndisagreeable persons, of course. They were often in Belem to ride,\nfish, or play billiards. \"Pa hates them,\" she said in conclusion. Mr.\nSomers entering at this moment, in his _diplomatique_ style, his gouty\nwhite hands shaded with wristbands, and his throat tied with a white\ncravat, appeared to contradict her assertion, he was so affable in his\nsalutations to the young men. Desmond turned from the piano when he\nheard his father's voice, and caught sight of me. He started toward\nme; but his attention was claimed by one of the gentlemen, who had\nbeen giving me a prolonged stare, and he dropped back on his seat,\nwith an indifferent air, answering some question relating to myself.\nHe looked as when I first saw him--flushed, haughty, and bored. His\nhair and dress were disordered, his boots splashed with mud; and it\nwas evident that he did not intend to appear at the party.\n\nAdelaide called me to remain by her; but I slipped away when I thought\nno more would arrive, and sought a retired corner, to which Mr. Somers\nbrought Desmond's friends, introducing them as the sons of his college\nchums, and leaving them, one lolling against the mantel, the other\nover the back of a chair. They were muzzy with drink, and seemed to\ngrow warm, as I looked from one to the other, with an attentive air.\n\n\"You are visiting in Belem,\" said one.\n\n\"That is true,\" I replied.\n\n\"It is too confoundedly aristocratic for me; it knocks Beacon Street\ninto nothingness.\"\n\n\"Where is Beacon Street?\"\n\n\"Don't you know _that_? Nor the Mall?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nOur conversation was interrupted by Ben, whom I had not seen since the\nday before. He had been out of town, transacting some business for\nhis father. We looked at each other without speaking, but divined each\nother's thoughts. \"You _are_ as true and noble as I think you are,\nCassy. I must have it so. You _shall not_ thwart me.\" \"Faithful\nand good Ben,--do you pass a sufficiently strict examination upon\nyourself? Are you not disposed to carry through your own ideas without\nconsidering _me_?\" Whatever our internal comments were, we smiled upon\neach other with the sincerity of friendship, and I detected Mr. Digby\nin the act of elevating his eyebrows at Mr. Devereaux, who signified\nhis opinion by telegraphing back: \"It is all over with them.\"\n\n\"Hey, Somers,\" said the first; \"what are you doing nowadays?\"\n\n\"Pretty much the same work that I always have on hand.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to stick to Belem?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I thought so. But what has come over Des. lately? He is spoony.\"\n\n\"He is going backward, may be, to some course he omitted in his career\nwith you fellows. We must run the same round somehow, you know.\"\n\n\"He'll not find much reason for it, when he arrives,\" Mr. Devereaux\nsaid.\n\nMiss Munster joined us, with the intention of breaking up our\nconclave, and soon moved away, with Mr. Digby and Devereaux in her\ntrain.\n\n\"I have changed my mind,\" said Ben, \"about going home with you.\"\n\n\"Are your plans growing complicated again?\"\n\n\"Can you go to Surrey alone?\"\n\n\"Why not, pray?\"\n\n\"I have an idea of going to Switzerland to spend the summer. Will\nVeronica be ready in the autumn?\"\n\n\"How can I answer? Shall you not take leave of her?\"\n\n\"Perhaps. Yes,--I must,\" he said excitedly; \"but to-morrow we will\ntalk more about it. I shall go to Boston with you; pa is going too.\nHow well you look to-night, Cassy! What sort of dress is this?\" taking\nup a fold of it. \"Is it cotton-silk, or silk-cotton? It is soft and\nlight. How delicate you are, with your gold hair and morning-glory\neyes!\"\n\n\"How poetical! My dress is new, and was made by Adelaide's\ndressmaker.\"\n\n\"Mother beckons me. What a headdress that is of hers!\"\n\n\"What beckons you to go to Switzerland?\" I mused.\n\nI listened for Desmond's voice, which would have sounded like a silver\nbell, in the loud, coarse buzz which pervaded the rooms. All the women\nwere talking shrill, and the men answering in falsetto. He was\nnot among them, and I moved to and fro unnoticed, for the tide of\nentertainment had set in, and I could withdraw, if I chose. I took a\nchair near an open door, commanded a view into a small room, on the\nother side of the hall, opened only on occasions like these; there\nwas no one in it. Perceiving that my shoelace was untied, I stooped to\nrefasten it, and when I looked in the room again saw Desmond standing\nunder the chandelier, his hands in his pockets, his eyes on the floor,\nhis hair disordered and falling over his forehead; its blackness was\nintense against the relief of the crimson wall-paper. Was it that\nwhich had unaccountably changed his appearance?\n\nHe raised his head, looked across the hall, and saw me.\n\n\"Come here,\" he signaled. I rose like an automaton, and cast an\ninvoluntary glance about me; the guests were filing through the\ndrawing-room, into the room where refreshments were laid. When the\nlast had gone, I left the friendly protection of the niche by the\nfire-place, and stood so near him that I saw his nostrils quiver! Then\nthere came into his face an expression of pain, which softened it. I\nhad wished him to please me; _now_ I wished to please him. It seemed\nthat he had no intention of speaking, and that he had called me to\nhim to witness a struggle which I must find a key to hereafter, in the\ndepths of my own heart. I watched him in silence, and it passed. As\nhe pushed the door to with his foot, the movement caused something\nto swing and glitter against his breast--a ring on his watch-ribbon\nsmaller than I could wear, a woman's ruby ring. The small, feminine\nimp, who abides with those who have beams in their eyes, and helps\nthem to extract motes from the eyes of others, inspired me. I pointed\nto the ring. Dropping his eyes, he said: \"I loved her shamefully, and\nshe loved me shamefully. When shall I take it off--cursed sign?\" And\nhe snapped it with his thumb and finger.\n\nI grew rigid with virtue.\n\n\"You may not conjure up any tragic ideas on the subject. She is no\noutcast. She is here to-night; if there was ruin, it was mutual.\"\n\n\"And your other faults?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" he said, with a terrible accent, \"we shall see.\"\n\nThere was a tap on the door; it was Ben's. I fell back a step, and\nhe came in. \"Will you bring Cassandra to the supper-room?\" he said,\nturning pale.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Come with me, then; you must.\" And he put my arm in his.\n\n\"Hail, and farewell, Cassandra!\" said Desmond, standing before the\ndoor. \"Give me your hand.\"\n\nI gave him both my hands. He kissed one, and then the other, and\nmoved to let us pass out. But Ben did not go; he fumbled for his\nhandkerchief to wipe his forehead, on which stood beads of sweat.\n\n\"_Allons,_ Ben,\" I said.\n\n\"Go on, go on,\" said Desmond, holding the door wide open.\n\nA painful curiosity made me anxious to discover the owner of the ruby\nring! The friendly but narrow-minded imp I have spoken of composed\nspeeches, with which I might assail her, should she be found. I looked\nin vain at every women present; there was not a sorrowful or guilty\nface among them. Another feeling took the place of my curiosity. I\nforgot the woman I was seeking, to remember the love I bore Desmond. I\nwas mad for the sight of him--mad to touch his hand once more. I could\nhave put the asp on my breast to suck me to sleep, as Cleopatra did;\nbut _C\u00c3\u00a6sar_ was in the way. He stayed by me till the lights were\nturned down.\n\nDigby and Devereaux were commenting on Desmond's disappearance, and\nMrs. Somers was politely yawning, waiting their call for candles.\n\n\"If you are to accompany me, Ben,\" I said, \"now is the time.\" And\nhe slipped out. He preserved a determined silence. I shook him, and\nsaid--\"_Veronica_.\" He put his hand over my mouth with an indignant\nlook, which was lost upon me, for I whispered in his ear; \"Do you know\nnow that I _love_ Desmond?\"\n\n\"Will you bring him into our Paradise?\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Our home, in Surrey.\"\n\n\"Wont an angel with a flaming sword make it piquant?\"\n\n\"If you marry Desmond Somers,\" he said austerely, \"you will contradict\nthree lives,--yours, mine, and Veronica's. What beast was it that\nsuggested this horrible discord? Have you so much passion that you\ncannot discern the future you offer yourself?\"\n\n\"Imperator, you have an agreeable way of putting things. But they are\ncoming through the hall. Good-night.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\n\nAt eleven o'clock the next day I was ready for departure. All stood by\nthe open hall door, criticising Murphy's strapping of my trunks on a\nhack. Messrs. Digby and Devereaux, in black satin scarfs, hung over\nthe step railings; Mrs. Somers, Adelaide, and Ann were within the\ndoor. Mr. Somers and Ben were already on the walk, waiting for me; so\nI went through the ceremony of bidding good-by--a ceremony performed\nwith so much cheerfulness on all sides that it was an occasion for\nwell-bred merriment, and I made my exit as I should have made it in a\ngenteel comedy, but with a bitter feeling of mortification, because of\ntheir artificial, willful imperturbability I was forced to oppose them\nwith manners copied after their own.\n\nI looked from the carriage window for a last view of my room. The\nchambermaid was already there, and had thrown open the shutters, to\nlet in daylight upon the scene of the most royal dreams I had ever\nhad. The ghost of my individuality would lurk there no longer than\nthe chairs I had placed, the books I had left, the shreds of paper or\nflowers I had scattered, could be moved or swept away.\n\nAll the way to Boston the transition to my old condition oppressed me.\nI felt a dreary disgust at the necessity of resuming relations which\nhad no connection with the sentiment that bound me to Belem. After we\nwere settled at the Tremont, while watching a sad waiter engaged\nin the ceremonial of folding napkins like fans, I discovered an\nintermediate tone of mind, which gave my thoughts a picturesque tinge.\nMy romance, its regrets, and its pleasures, should be set in the frame\nof the wild sea and shores of Surrey. I invested our isolated house\nwith the dignity of a stage, where the drama, which my thoughts must\ncontinually represent, could go on without interruption, and remain a\nsecret I should have no temptation to reveal. Until after the tedious\ndinner, a complete rainbow of dreams spanned the arc of my brain. Mr.\nSomers dispersed it by asking Ben to go out on some errand. That it\nwas a pretext, I knew by Ben's expression; therefore, when he had gone\nI turned to Mr. Somers an attentive face. First, he circumlocuted;\nsecond, he skirmished. I still waited for what he wished to say,\nwithout giving him any aid. He was sure, he said at last, that my\nvisit in his family had convinced me that his children could not vary\nthe destiny imposed upon them by their antecedents, without bringing\nupon _others_ lamentable consequences. \"Cunning pa,\" I commented\ninternally. Had I not seen the misery of unequal marriages?\n\n\"As in a glass, darkly.\"\n\nDoubtless, he went on, I had comprehended the erratic tendency in\n_Ben's_ character, good and honorable as he was, but impressive and\nvisionary. Did I think so?\n\n\"Quite the contrary. Have you never perceived the method of his\nvisions in an unvarying opposition to those antecedents you boast of?\"\n\n\"Well, _well_, well?\"\n\n\"Money, Family, Influence,--are a ding-dong bell which you must weary\nof, Mr. Somers--sometimes.\"\n\n\"Ben has disappointed me; I must confess that.\"\n\n\"My sister is eccentric. Provided she marries him, the family\nprogramme will be changed. You must lop him from the family tree.\"\n\nHe took up a paper, bowed to me with an unvexed air, and read a column\nor so.\n\n\"It may be absurd,\" and he looked over his spectacle tops, as if\nhe had found the remark in his paper, \"for parents to oppose the\nmarriages their children choose to make, and I beg you to understand\nthat I may _oppose_, not _resist_ Ben. You know very well,\" and he\ndropped the paper in a burst of irritation and candor, \"that the devil\nwill be to pay with Mrs. Somers, who has a right of dictation in the\naffair. She does not suspect it. I must say that Ben is mistaking\nhimself again. I mean, I think so.\"\n\nI looked upon him with a more friendly countenance. The one rude word\nhe had spoken had a wonderful effect, after the surprise of it was\nover. Real eyes appeared in his face, and a truthful accent pervaded\nhis voice. I think he was beginning to think that he might confide his\nperplexities to me on other subjects, when Ben returned. As it was,\na friendly feeling had been established between us. He said in a\nconfidential tone to Ben, as if we were partners in some guilty\nsecret, \"You must mention it to your mother; indeed you must.\"\n\n\"You have been speaking with Cassandra, in reference to her sister,\"\nhe answered indifferently. Mr. Somers was chilled in his attempt at a\nmutual confidence.\n\n\"Can you raise money, if Desmond should marry?\" asked Ben. \"Enough for\nboth of us?\"\n\n\"Desmond? he will never marry.\"\n\n\"It is certainly possible.\"\n\n\"You know how I am clogged.\"\n\nI rang for some ice-water, and when the waiter brought it, said that\nit was time to retire.\n\n\"Now,\" said Mr. Somers, \"I shall give you just such a breakfast as\nwill enable you to travel well--a beefsteak, and old bread made into\ntoast. Don't drink that ice-water; take some wine.\"\n\nI set the glass of ice-water down, and declined the wine. Ben elevated\nhis eyebrows, and asked:\n\n\"What time shall I get up, sir?\"\n\n\"I will call you; so you may sleep untroubled.\"\n\nHe opened the door, and bade me an affectionate good night.\n\n\"The coach is ready,\" a waiter announced, as we finished our\nbreakfast. \"We are ready,\" said Mr. Somers. \"I have ordered a packet\nof sandwiches for you--_beef_, not ham sandwiches--and here is a flask\nof wine mixed with water.\"\n\nI thanked him, and tied my bonnet.\n\n\"Here is a note, also,\" opening his pocketbook and extracting it, \"for\nyour father. It contains our apologies for not accompanying you, and\none or two allusions,\" making an attempt to wink at Ben, which failed,\nhis eyes being unused to such an undignified style of humor.\n\nHe excused himself from going to the station on account of the morning\nair, and Ben and I proceeded. In the passage, the waiter met us with a\npaper box. \"For you, Miss. A florist's boy just left it.\" I opened it\nin the coach, and seeing flowers, was about to take them out to show\nBen, when I caught sight of the ribbon which tied them--a piece of one\nof my collar knots I had not missed. Of course the flowers came from\nDesmond, and half the ribbon was in his possession; the ends were\njagged, as if it had been divided with a knife. Instead of taking out\nthe flowers, I showed him the box.\n\n\"What a curious bouquet,\" he said.\n\nIn the cars he put into my hand a jewel box, and a thick letter for\nVerry, kissed me, and was out of sight.\n\n\"No vestige but these flowers,\" uncovering them again. \"In my room at\nSurrey I will take you out,\" and I shut the box. The clanking of the\ncar wheels revolved through my head in rhythm, excluding thought for\nmiles. Then I looked out at the flying sky--it was almost May. The\nday was mild and fair; in the hollows, the young grass spread over the\nearth like a smooth cloth; over the hills and unsheltered fields, the\nold grass lay like coarse mats. A few birds roved the air in anxiety,\nfor the time of love was at hand, and their nests were not finished.\nBy twelve I arrived at the town where the railroad branched in a\ndirection opposite the road to Surrey, and where a stage was waiting\nfor its complement of passengers from the cars. I was the only lady\n\"aboard,\" as one of the passengers intelligently remarked, when we\nstarted. They were desirable companions, for they were gruff to\neach other and silent to me. We rode several miles in a state\nof unadjustment, and then yielded to the sedative qualities of a\nstagecoach. I lunched on my sandwiches, thanking Mr. Somers for his\nforethought, though I should have preferred them of ham, instead of\nbeef. When I took a sip from my flask, two men looked surprised, and\nspat vehemently out of the windows. I offered it to them. They\nrefused it, saying they had had what was needful at the Depot Saloon,\nconducted on the strictest temperance principles.\n\n\"Those principles are cruel, provided travelers ever have colic, or an\naversion to Depot tea and coffee,\" I said.\n\nThere was silence for the space of fifteen minutes, then one of them\nturned and said: \"You have a good head, marm.\"\n\n\"Too good?\"\n\n\"Forgetful, may be.\"\n\nI bowed, not wishing to prolong the conversation.\n\n\"Your circulation is too rapid,\" he continued.\n\nThe man on the seat with him now turned round, and, examining me,\ninformed me that electricity would be first-rate for me.\n\n\"Shoo!\" he replied, \"it's a humbug.\"\n\nI was forgotten in the discussion which followed, and which lasted\ntill our arrival at a village, where one of them resided. He left,\ntelling us he was a \"natral bone-setter.\" One by one the passengers\nleft the stage, and for the last five miles I was alone. I beguiled\nthe time by elaborating a multitude of trivial opinions, suggested by\nobjects I saw along the roadside, till the old and new church spires\nof Surrey came in sight, and the curving lines at either end of the\nascending shores. We reached the point in the north road, where the\nground began its descent to the sea, and I hung from the window, to\nsee all the village roofs humble before it. The streets and dwellings\nlooked as insignificant as those of a toy village. I perceived no\nmovement in it, heard no hum of life. At a cross-road, which would\ntake the stage into the village without its passing our house, a whim\npossessed me. I would surprise them at home, and go in at the back\ndoor, while they were expecting to hear the stage. The driver let me\nout, and I stood in the road till he was out of sight.\n\nA breeze blew round me, penetrating, but silent; the fields, and the\ndistant houses which dotted them, were asleep in the pale sunshine,\nundisturbed by it. The crows cawed, and flew over the eastern woods.\nI walked slowly. The road was deserted. Mrs. Grossman's house was\nthe only one I must pass; its shutters were closed, and the yard was\nempty. As I drew near home a violent haste grew upon me, yet my feet\nseemed to impede my progress. They were like lead; I impelled myself\nalong, as in a dream. Under the protection of our orchard wall I\nturned my merino mantle, which was lined with an indefinite color,\nspread my veil over my bonnet, and bent my shoulders, and passed down\nthe carriage-drive, by the dining-room windows, into the stable-yard.\nThe rays of sunset struck the lantern-panes in the light-house, and\ngave the atmosphere a yellow stain. The pigeons were skimming up and\ndown the roof of the wood-house, and cooing round the horses that were\nin the yard. A boy was driving cows into the shed, whistling a lively\nair; he suspended it when he saw me, but I shook my finger at him, and\nran in. Slipping into the side hall, I dropped my bonnet and shawl,\nand listened at the door for the familiar voices. Mother must be\nthere, as was her wont, and Aunt Merce. All of them, perhaps, for\nI had seen nobody on my way. There was no talking within. The last\nsunset ray struck on my hand its yellow shade, through the fan-light,\nand faded before I opened the door. I was arrested on the threshold by\na silence which rushed upon me, clutching me in a suffocating embrace.\nMother was in her chair by the fire, which was out, for the brands\nwere black, and one had fallen close to her feet. A white flannel\nshawl covered her shoulders; her chin rested on her breast. \"She\nis ill, and has dropped asleep,\" I thought, thrusting my hands out,\nthrough this terrible silence, to break her slumber, and looked at the\nclock; it was near seven. A door slammed, somewhere upstairs, so loud\nit made me jump; but she did not wake. I went toward her, confused,\nand stumbling against the table, which was between us, but reached her\nat last. Oh, I knew it! She was dead! People must die, even in their\nchairs, alone! What difference did it make, how? An empty cup was in\nher lap, bottom up; I set it carefully on the mantel shelf above her\nhead. Her handkerchief was crumpled in her nerveless hand; I drew it\naway and thrust it into my bosom. My gloves tightened my hands as I\ntried to pull them off, and was tugging at them, when a door opened,\nand Veronica came in.\n\n\"She is dead,\" I said. \"I can't get them off.\"\n\n\"It is false\"; and she staggered backward, with her hand on her heart,\ntill she fell against the wall. I do not know how long we remained\nso, but I became aware of a great confusion--cries, and exclamations;\npeople were running in and out. Fanny rolled on the floor in\nhysterics.\n\n\"Get up,\" I said. \"I can't move; help me. Where did Verry go?\"\n\nShe got up, and pulled me along. I saw father raise mother in his\narms. The dreadful sight of her swaying arms and drooping head made me\nlose my breath; but Veronica forced me to endurance by clinging to me,\nand dragging me out of the room and upstairs. She turned the key of\nthe glass-door at the head of the passage, not letting go of me. I\ntook her by the arms, placed her in a chair, and closing my window\ncurtains, sat down beside her in the dark.\n\n\"Where will they carry her?\" she asked, shuddering, and putting her\nfingers in her ears. \"How the water splashes on the beach! Is the tide\ncoming in?\"\n\nShe was appalled by the physical horror of death, and asked me\nincessant questions.\n\n\"Let us keep her away from the grave,\" she said.\n\nI could not answer, or hear her at last, for sleep overpowered me. I\nstruggled against it in vain. It seemed the greatest good; let death\nand judgment come, I must sleep. I threw myself on my bed, and the\ntouch of the pillow sealed my eyes. I started from a dream about\nsomething that happened when I was a little child. \"Veronica, are you\nhere?\"\n\n\"Mother is dead,\" she answered.\n\nA mighty anguish filled my breast. Mother!--her goodness and beauty,\nher pure heart, her simplicity--I felt them all. I pitied her dead,\nbecause she would never know how I valued her. Veronica shed no tears,\nbut sighed heavily. _Duty_ sounded through her sighs. \"Verry,\nshall _I_ take care of you? I think I can.\" She shook her head; but\npresently she stretched her hands in search of my face, kissed it, and\nanswered, \"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"You must go to your own room and rest.\"\n\n\"Can you keep everybody from me?\"\n\n\"I will try.\"\n\nOpening her window, she looked out over the earth wistfully, and at\nthe sky, thickly strewn with stars, which revealed her face. We heard\nsomebody coming up the back stairs.\n\n\"Temperance,\" said Verry.\n\n\"Are you in the dark, girls?\" she asked, wringing her hands, when she\nhad put down her lamp. \"What an awful Providence!\" She looked with a\npainful anxiety at Veronica.\n\n\"It is all Providence, Temperance, whether we are alive or dead,\" I\nsaid. \"Let us let Providence alone.\"\n\n\"What did I ever leave her for? She wasn't fit to take care of\nherself. Why, Cassandra Morgeson, you haven't got off all your things\nyet. And what's this sticking out of your bosom?\"\n\n\"It is her handkerchief.\" I kissed it, and now Verry began to weep\nover it, begging me for it. I gave it up to her.\n\n\"It will kill your father.\"\n\nI had not thought of him.\n\n\"It's most nine o'clock. Sofrony Beals is here; she lays out\nbeautifully.\"\n\n\"No, no; don't let anybody touch her!\" shrieked Verry.\n\n\"No, they shan't. Come into the kitchen; you must have something to\neat.\"\n\nI was faint from the want of food, and when Temperance prepared us\nsomething I ate heartily. Veronica drank a little milk, but would\ntaste nothing. Aunt Merce, who had been out to tea, Temperance said,\ncame into the kitchen.\n\n\"My poor girl, I have not seen you,\" embracing me, half blind with\ncrying, \"How pale you are! How sunken! Keep up as well as you can.\nI little thought that the worthless one of us two would be left to\nsuffer. Go to your father, as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Drink this tea right down, Mercy,\" said Temperance, holding a cup\nbefore her. \"There isn't much to eat in the house. Of all times in the\nworld to be without good victuals! What could Hepsey have meant?\"\n\n\"Poor old soul,\" Aunt Merce replied, \"she is quite broken. Fanny had\nto help her upstairs.\"\n\nThe kitchen door opened, and Temperance's husband, Abram, came in.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" she said in an irate voice, \"have you come, too? Did you\nthink I couldn't get home to get your breakfast?\"\n\nShe hung the kettle on the fire again, muttering too low for him to\nhear: \"Some folks could be spared better than other folks.\"\n\nAbram shoved back his hat. \"'The Lord gives and the Lord takes away,'\nbut she is a dreadful loss to the poor. There's my poor boy, whose\nclothes--\"\n\n\"Ain't he the beatum of all the men that ever you see?\" broke in\nTemperance, taking to him a large piece of pie, which he took with a\nshort laugh, and sat down to eat. I could not help exchanging a look\nwith Aunt Merce; we both laughed. Veronica, lost in revery, paid no\nattention to anything about her. I saw that Temperance suffered; she\nwas perplexed and irritated.\n\n\"Let Abram stay, if he likes,\" I whispered to her; \"and be sure to\nstay yourself, for you are needed.\"\n\nShe brightened with an expression of gratitude. \"He is a nuisance,\"\nshe whispered back; \"but as I made a fool of myself, I must be\npunished according to my folly. I'll stay, you may depend. I'll do\n_everything_ for you. I vow I am mad, that I ever went away.\"\n\n\"Have the neighbors gone?\" I asked.\n\n\"There's a couple or so round, and will be, you know. I'll take Verry\nto bed, and sleep on the floor by her. You go to your father.\"\n\nHe was in their bedroom, on the bed. She was lying on a frame of wood,\ncovered with canvas, a kind of bed which went from house to house in\nSurrey, on occasions of sickness or death.\n\n\"Our last night together has passed,\" he said in a tremulous voice,\nwhile scanty tears fell from his seared eyes. \"The space between then\nand now--when her arm was round me, when she slept beside me, when I\nwoke from a bad dream, and she talked gently close to my face, till\nI slept again--is so narrow that I recall it with a sense of\nreality which agonizes me; it is so immeasurable when I see her\nthere--_there_, that I am crushed.\"\n\nIf I had had any thought of speaking to him, it was gone. And I must\ngo too. Were the hands folded across her breast, where I, also, had\nslept? Were the blue eyes closed that had watched me there? I should\nnever see. A shroud covered her from all eyes but his now. Till I\nclosed the door upon him, I looked my last farewell. An elderly woman\nmet me as I was going upstairs, and offered me a small packet; it was\nher hair. \"It was very long,\" she said. I tried in vain to thank her.\n\"I will place it in a drawer for you,\" she said kindly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\n\nThe house was thronged till after the funeral. We sat in state, to be\ncondoled with and waited upon. Not a jot of the customary rites\nwas abated, though I am sure the performers thereof had small\nencouragement. Veronica alone would see no one; her room was the only\none not invaded; for the neighbors took the house into their hands,\nassisted by that part of the Morgesons who were too distantly related\nto consider themselves as mourners to be shut up with us. It was put\nunder rigorous funeral law, and inspected from garret to cellar. They\nsupervised all the arrangements, if there were any that they did not\nmake, received the guests who came from a distance, and aided their\ndeparture. Every child in Surrey was allowed to come in, to look at\nthe dead, with the idle curiosity of childhood. Veronica knew nothing\nof this. Her course was taken for granted; mine was imposed upon me.\nI remonstrated with Temperance, but she replied that it was all well\nmeant, and always done. I endured the same annoyances over and over\nagain, from relays of people. Bed-time especially was their occasion.\nI was not allowed to undress alone. I must have drinks, either to\ncompose or stimulate; I must have something read to me; I must be\nwatched when I slept, or I must be kept awake to give advice or be\ntold items of news. All the while, like a chorus, they reiterated the\ncharacter, the peculiarities, the virtues of the mother I had lost,\nwho could never be replaced--who was in a better world. However, I\nwas, in a measure, kept from myself during this interval. The matter\nis often subservient to the manner. Arthur's feelings were played upon\nalso. He wept often, confiding to me his grief and his plans for the\nfuture. \"If people would die at the age of seventy-five, things would\ngo well,\" he said, \"for everybody must expect to die then; the Bible\nsays so.\" He informed me also that he expected to be an architect, and\nthat mother liked it. He had an idea, which he had imparted to her, of\nan arch; it must be made of black marble, with gold veins, and ought\nto stand in Egypt, with the word \"_Pandemonium_\" on it. The kitchen\nwas the focus of interest to him, for meals were prepared at all hours\nfor comers and goers. Temperance told me that the mild and indifferent\nmourners were fond of good victuals, and she thought their hearts were\nlighter than their stomachs when they went away. She presided there\nand wrangled with Fanny, who seemed to have lost her capacity for\ndoing anything steadily, except, as Temperance said, where father was\nconcerned. \"It's a pity she isn't his dog; she might keep at his\nfeet then. I found her crying awfully yesterday, because he looked so\ngrief-struck.\"\n\nAunt Merce was engaged with a dressmaker, and with the orders for\nbonnets and veils. She discussed the subject of the mourning with the\nMorgesons. I acquiesced in all her arrangements, for she derived a\nsimple comfort from these external tokens. Veronica refused to wear\nthe bonnet and veil and the required bombazine. Bombazine made her\nflesh crawl. Why should she wear it? Mother hated it, too, for she had\nnever worn out the garments made for Grand'ther Warren.\n\n\"She's a bigger child than ever,\" Temperance remarked, \"and must have\nher way.\"\n\n\"Do you think the border on my cap is too deep?\" asked Aunt Merce,\ncoming into my room dressed for the funeral.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"The cap came from Miss Nye in Milford; she says they wear them so. I\ncould have made it myself for half the price. Shall you be ready\nsoon? I am going to put on my bonnet. The yard is full of carriages\nalready.\"\n\nSomebody handed me gloves; my bonnet was tied, a handkerchief given\nto me, and the door opened. In the passage I heard a knocking from\nVeronica's room, and crossed to learn what she wanted.\n\n\"Is this like her?\" she asked, showing me a drawing.\n\n\"How could you have done this?\"\n\n\"Because I have tried. _Is_ it like?\"\n\n\"Yes, the idea.\"\n\nBut what a picture she had attempted to make! Mother's shadowy face\nserenely looked from a high, small window, set in clouds, like those\nwhich gather over the sun when it \"draws water.\" It was closely\npressed to the glass, and she was regarding dark, indefinite creatures\nbelow it, which Veronica either could not or would not shape.\n\n\"Keep it; but don't work on it any more.\" And I put it away. She was\nwan and languid, but collected.\n\n\"I see you are ready. Somebody must bury the dead. Go. Will the house\nbe empty?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good; I can walk through it once more.\"\n\n\"The dead must be buried, that is certain; but why should it be\ncertain that _I_ must be the one to do it?\"\n\n\"You think I can go through with it, then?\"\n\n\"I have set your behavior down to your will.\"\n\n\"You may be right. Perhaps mother was always right about me too; she\nwas against me.\"\n\nShe looked at me with a timidity and apprehension that made my heart\nbleed. \"I think we might kiss each other _now_,\" she said.\n\nI opened my arms, holding her against my breast so tightly that she\ndrew back, but kissed my cheek gently, and took from her pocket a\nfla\u00c3\u00a7on of salts, which she fastened to my belt by its little chain,\nand said again, \"Go,\" but recalling me, said, \"One thing more; I will\nnever lose temper with you again.\"\n\nThe landing-stair was full of people. I locked the door, and took out\nthe key; the stairs were crowded. All made way for me with a silent\nrespect. Aunt Merce, when she saw me, put her hand on an empty chair,\nbeside father, who sat by the coffin. Those passages in the Bible\nwhich contain the beautifully poetic images relating to the going of\nman to his long home were read, and to my ear they seemed to fall on\nthe coffin in dull strife with its inmate, who mutely contradicted\nthem. A discourse followed, which was calculated to harrow the\nfeelings to the utmost. Arthur began to cry so nervously, that some\nconsiderate friend took him out, and Aunt Merce wept so violently that\nshe grew faint, and caught hold of me. I gave her the fla\u00c3\u00a7on of salts,\nwhich revived her; but I felt as father looked--stern, and anxious to\nescape the unprofitable trial.\n\nAs the coffin was taken out to the hearse, my heart twisted and\npalpitated, as if a command had been laid upon it to follow, and not\nleave her. But I was imprisoned in the cage of Life--the Keeper would\nnot let me go; her he had let loose.\n\nWe were still obliged to sit an intolerable while, till all present\nhad passed before her for the last time. When the hearse moved down\nthe street, father, Arthur, and I were called, and assisted in our own\nchaise, as if we were helpless; the reins were put in father's hands,\nand the horse was led behind the hearse. At last the word was given,\nand the long procession began to move through the street, which was\ndeserted. A cat ran out of a house, and scampered across the way;\nArthur laughed, and father jumped nervously at the sound of his laugh.\n\nThe graveyard was a mile outside the village--a sandy plain where a\nfew stunted pines transplanted from the woods near it struggled to\nkeep alive. As we turned from the street into the lane which led\nto it, and rode up a little hill where the sand was so deep that it\nmuffled the wheels and feet of the horses, the whole round of the gray\nsky was visible. It hung low over us. I wished it to drop and blot out\nthe vague nothings under it. We left the carriage at the palings and\nwalked up the narrow path, among the mounds, where every stone was\nmarked \"Morgeson.\" Some so old that they were stained with blotches\nof yellow moss, slanting backward and forward, in protest against the\nfolly of indicating what was no longer beneath them. The mounds were\ncovered with mats of scanty, tangled grass, with here and there a rank\nspot of green. I was tracing the shape of one of those green patches\nwhen I felt father's arm tremble. I shut my eyes, but could not close\nmy ears to the sound of the spadeful of sand which fell on the coffin.\n\nIt was over. We must leave her to the creatures Veronica had seen. I\nlooked upward, to discern the shadowy reflection behind the gray haze\nof cloud, where she might have paused a moment on her eternal journey\nto the eternal world of souls.\n\nIt was the custom, and father took his hat off to thank his friends\nfor their sympathy and attention. His lips moved, but no words were\naudible.\n\nThe procession moved down the path again. Arthur's hand was in mine;\nhe stamped his feet firmly on the sand, as if to break the oppressive\nsilence which no one seemed disposed to disturb. The same ceremonies\nwere performed in starting us homeward, by the same person, who let\ngo the reins, and lifted his hat as we passed, as the final token of\nattention and respect.\n\nThe windows were open; a wind was blowing through the house, the\nfurniture was set in order, the doors were thrown back, but not a soul\nwas there when we went in. The duties of friendship and tradition had\nbeen fulfilled; the neighbors had gone home to their avocations. For\nthe public, the tragedy was over; all speculation on the degree of\nour grief, or our indifference, was settled. We could take off our\nmourning garments and our mourning countenance, now that we were\nalone; or we could give way to that anguish we are afraid and ashamed\nto show, except before the One above human emotion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\n\nTemperance stayed to the house-cleaning. It was lucky, she could not\nhelp saying, as house-cleaning must always be after a funeral, that\nit should have happened at the regular cleaning-time. She went back\nto her own house as soon as it was over. Father drove to Milford as\nusual; Arthur resumed his school, and Aunt Merce, who had at first\nbusied herself in looking over her wardrobe, and selecting from it\nwhat she thought could be dyed, folded it away. She passed hours in\nmother's room, from which father had fled, crying over her Bible,\nlooking in her boxes and drawers to feed her sorrow with the sight of\nthe familiar things, alternating those periods with her old occupation\nof looking out of the windows. In regard to myself, and Veronica, she\nevinced a distress at the responsibility which, she feared, must\nrest upon her. Veronica, dark and silent, played such heart-piercing\nstrains that father could not bear to hear her; so when she played,\nfor he dared not ask her to desist, he went away. To me she had\nscarcely spoken since the funeral. She wore the same dress each\nday--one of black silk--and a small black mantle, pinned across her\nbosom. Soon the doors began to open and shut after their old fashion,\nand people came and went as of old on errands of begging or borrowing.\n\nAt the table we felt a sense of haste; instead of lingering, as was\nour wont, we separated soon, with an indifferent air, as if we were\ncalled by business, not sent away by sorrow. But if our eyes fell on a\ncertain chair, empty against the wall, a cutting pang was felt,\nwhich was not at all concealed; for there were sudden breaks in our\ncommonplace talk, which diverged into wandering channels, betraying\nthe tension of feeling.\n\nMany weeks passed, through which I endured an aching, aimless\nmelancholy. My thoughts continually drifted through the vacuum in\nour atmosphere, and returned to impress me with a disbelief in the\nenjoyment, or necessity of keeping myself employed with the keys of an\ninstrument, which, let me strike ever so cunningly, it was certain I\ncould never obtain mastery over.\n\nOne day I went to walk by the shore, for the first time since my\nreturn. When I set my foot on the ground, the intolerable light of the\nbrilliant day blazed through me; I was luminously dark, for it blinded\nme. Picking my way over the beach, left bare by the tide, with my eyes\nfixed downward till I could see, I reached the point between our\nhouse and the lighthouse and turned toward the sea, inhaling its cool\nfreshness. I climbed out to a flat, low rock, on the point; it was dry\nin the sun, and the weeds hanging from its sides were black and crisp;\nI put my woolen shawl on it, and stretched myself along its edge.\nLittle pools meshed from the sea by the numberless rocks round me\nengrossed my attention. How white and pellucid was the shallow near\nme--no shadow but the shadow of my face bending over it--nothing to\nripple its surface, but my imperceptible breath! By and by a bunch of\nknotted wrack floated in from the outside and lodged in a crevice; a\nminute creature with fringed feet darted from it and swam across\nit. After the knotted wrack came the fragment of a green and silky\nsubstance, delicate enough to have been the remnant of a web, woven\nin the palace of Circe. \"There must be a current,\" I thought, \"which\nsends them here.\" And I watched the inlet for other waifs; but nothing\nmore came. Eye-like bubbles rose from among the fronds of the knotted\nwrack, and, sailing on uncertain voyages, broke one by one and were\nwrecked to nothingness. The last vanished; the pool showed me the\nmotionless shadow of my face again, on which I pondered, till I\nsuddenly became aware of a slow, internal oscillation, which increased\ntill I felt in a strange tumult. I put my hand in the pool and\ntroubled its surface.\n\n\"Hail, Cassandra! Hail!\"\n\nI sprang up the highest rock on the point, and looked seaward, to\ncatch a glimpse of the flying Spirit who had touched me. My soul was\nbrought in poise and quickened with the beauty before me! The wide,\nshimmering plain of sea--its aerial blue, stretching beyond the\nlimits of my vision in one direction, upbearing transverse, cloud-like\nislands in another, varied and shadowed by shore and sky--mingled its\nessence with mine.\n\nThe wind was coming; under the far horizon the mass of waters begun to\nundulate. Dark, spear-like clouds rose above it and menaced the east.\nThe speedy wind tossed and teased the sea nearer and nearer, till I\nwas surrounded by a gulf of milky green foam. As the tide rolled in\nI retreated, stepping back from rock to rock, round which the waves\ncurled and hissed, baffled in their attempt to climb over me. I\nstopped on the verge of the tide-mark; the sea was seeking me and I\nmust wait. It gave tongue as its lips touched my feet, roaring in the\ncaves, falling on the level beaches with a mad, boundless joy!\n\n\"Have then at life!\" my senses cried. \"We will possess its longing\nsilence, rifle its waiting beauty. We will rise up in its light\nand warmth, and cry, 'Come, for we wait.' Its roar, its beauty, its\nmadness--we will have--_all_.\" I turned and walked swiftly homeward,\ntreading the ridges of white sand, the black drifts of sea-weed, as if\nthey had been a smooth floor.\n\nAunt Merce was at the door.\n\n\"Now,\" she said, \"we are going to have the long May storm. The gulls\nare flying round the lighthouse. How high the tide is! You must want\nyour dinner. I wish you _would_ see to Fanny; she is lording it over\nus all.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I will do it; you may depend on me. I will reign, and serve\nalso.\"\n\n\"Oh, Cassandra, _can_ you give up _yourself?_\"\n\n\"I must, I suppose. Confound the spray; it is flying against the\nwindows.\"\n\n\"Come in; your hair is wet, and your shawl is wringing. Now for a\ncold.\"\n\n\"I never shall have any more colds, Aunt Merce; never mean to have\nanything to myself--entirely, you know.\"\n\n\"You do me good, you dear girl; I love you\"; and she began to cry.\n\"There's nothing but cold ham and boiled rice for your dinner.\"\n\n\"What time is it?\"\n\n\"Near three.\"\n\nI opened the door of the dining-room; the table was laid, and I walked\nround it, on a tour of inspection.\n\n\"I thought you might as well have your dinner, all at once,\" said\nFanny, by the window, with her feet tucked up on the rounds of her\nchair. \"Here it is.\"\n\n\"I perceive. Who arranged it?\"\n\n\"Me and Paddy Margaret.\"\n\n\"How many tablecloths have we?\"\n\n\"Plenty. I thought as you didn't seem to care about any regular hour\nfor dinner, and made us all wait, _I_ needn't be particular; besides,\nI am not the waiter, you know.\"\n\nShe had set on the dishes used in the kitchen. I pulled off cloth and\nall--the dishes crashed, of course--and sat down on the floor, picking\nout the remains for my repast.\n\n\"What will Mr. Morgeson say?\" she asked, turning very red.\n\n\"Shall you clear away this rubbish by the time he comes home?\"\n\n\"Why, I must, mustn't I?\"\n\n\"I hope so. Where's Veronica?\"\n\n\"She has been gone since twelve; Sam carried her to Temperance's\nhouse.\"\n\nI continued my meal. Fanny brought a chair for me, which I did not\ntake. I scarcely tasted what I ate. A wall had risen up suddenly\nbefore me, which divided me from my dreams; I was inside it, on a\nprosaic domain I must henceforth be confined to. The unthought-of\nresult of mother's death--disorganization, began to show itself. The\nindividuality which had kept the weakness and faults of our family\nlife in abeyance must have been powerful; and I had never recognized\nit! I attempted to analyze this influence, so strong, yet so\ninvisibly produced. I thought of her mildness, her dreamy habits, her\nindifference, and her incapacity of comprehending natures unlike her\nown. Would endowment of character explain it--that faculty which\nwe could not change, give, or take? Character was a mysterious and\nindestructible fact, and a fact that I had had little respect for.\nUpon what a false basis I had gone--a basis of extremes. I had seen\nmen as trees walking; that was my experience.\n\n\"You'll choke yourself with that dry bread,\" exclaimed Fanny, really\nconcerned at my abstraction.\n\n\"Where is my trunk? Did you unlock it?\"\n\n\"I took from it what you needed at the time: but it is not unpacked,\nand it is in the upper hall closet.\"\n\nShe was picking up the broken delf meekly.\n\n\"Did you see a small bag I brought? And where's my satchel? Good\nheavens! What has made me put off that letter so? For I have thought\nof it, and yet I have kept it back.\"\n\n\"It is safe, in your closet, Miss Cassandra; and the box is there.\"\n\n\"Aunt Merce,\" I called, \"will you have nothing to eat?\"\n\nShe laughed hysterically, when she saw what I had done.\n\n\"Where is Hepsey, Aunt Merce?\"\n\n\"She goes to bed after dinner, you know, for an hour or two.\"\n\n\"She must go from here.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" they both chorused, \"what for?\"\n\n\"She is too old.\"\n\n\"She _has_ money, and a good house,\" said Aunt Merce, \"if she must go.\nI wonder how Mary stood it so long.\"\n\n\"Turn 'em off,\" said Fanny, \"when they grow useless.\"\n\nAunt Merce reddened, and looked hurt.\n\n\"I shall keep _you_; look sharp now after your own disinterestedness.\"\n\nI wanted to go to my room, as I thought it time to arrange my trunks\nand boxes; besides, I needed rest--the sad luxury of reaction. But\nword was brought to the house that Arthur had disappeared, in company\nwith two boys notorious for mischief. His teacher was afraid they\nmight have put out to sea in a crazy sailboat. We were in a state of\nalarm till dark, when father came home, bringing him, having found\nhim on the way to Milford. Veronica had not returned. It stormed\nviolently, and father was vexed because a horse must be sent through\nthe storm for her. At last I obtained the asylum of my room, in an\nirritable frame of mind, convinced that such would be my condition\neach day. Composure came with putting my drawers and shelves in order.\nThe box with Desmond's flowers I threw into the fire, without opening\nit, ribbon and all, for I could not endure the sight of them. I\nunfolded the dresses I had worn on the occasions of my meeting him;\neven the collars and ribbons I had adorned myself with were conned\nwith jealous, greedy eyes; in looking at them all other remembrances\nconnected with my visit vanished. The handkerchief scented with\nviolets, which I found in the pocket of the dress I had worn when I\nmet him at Mrs. Hepburn's, made me childish. I was holding it when\nVeronica entered, bringing with her an atmosphere of dampness.\n\n\"Violet! I like it. There is not one blooming yet, Temperance says.\nWhy are they so late? There's only this pitiful snake-grass,\" holding\nup a bunch of drooping, pale blossoms.\n\n\"Oh, Verry, can you forgive me? I did not forget these, but I felt the\nstrangest disinclination to look them up.\" And I gave her the jewel\nbox and letter.\n\nShe seized them, and opened the box first.\n\n\"Child-Verry.\"\n\n\"I never was a child, you know; but I am always trying to find my\nchildhood.\"\n\nShe took a necklace from the box, composed of a single string of\nsmall, beautiful pearls, from which hung an egg-shaped amethyst of\npure violet. She fastened the necklace round her throat.\n\n\"It is as lucent as the moon,\" she said, looking down at the amethyst,\nwhich shed a watery light; \"I wish you had given it to me before.\"\n\nBreaking the seal of the letter, with a twist of her mouth at the\ncoat-of-arms impressed upon it, she shook out the closely written\npages, and saying, \"There is a volume,\" began reading. \"It is\nvery good,\" she observed at the end of the first page, \"a regular\ncomposition,\" and went on with an air of increasing interest. \"How\ndoes he look?\" she asked, stopping again.\n\n\"As if he longed to see you.\"\n\nHer eyes went in quest of him so far that I thought they must be\nstartled by a sudden vision.\n\n\"How did you find his family?\"\n\n\"Not like him much.\"\n\n\"I knew that; he would not have loved me so suddenly had I not been\nwholly unlike any woman he had known.\"\n\n\"His character is individual.\"\n\n\"I should know that from his influence upon you.\"\n\nShe looked at me wistfully, smoothed my hair with her cool hand, and\nresumed the letter.\n\n\"He thinks he will not come to Surrey with you; asks me to tell him my\nwishes,\" she repeated rapidly, translating from the original. \"What do\nI think of our future? How shall we propose any change? Will Cassandra\ndescribe her visit? Will she tell me that he thinks of going abroad?\"\n\nShe dropped the letter. \"What pivot is he swinging on? What is he\nuncertain about?\"\n\n\"There must be more to read.\"\n\nShe turned another page.\n\n\"If I go to Switzerland (I think of going on account of family\naffairs), when shall I return? My family, of course, expected me to\nmarry in their pale; that is, my mother rather prefers to select a\nwife for me than that I should do it. But, as you shall never come to\nBelem, her plans or wishes need make no difference to us. If Cassandra\nwould be to us what she might, how things would clear! Don't you\nthink, my love, that there should be the greatest sympathy between\nsisters?\"\n\nI laughed.\n\nVerry said she did not like his letter much after all. He evidently\nthought her incapable of understanding ordinary matters. It was well,\nthough; it made their love idyllic.\n\n\"Let us speak of matters nearer home.\"\n\n\"Let us go to my room; the storm is so loud this side of the house.\"\n\n\"No; you must stay till the walls tremble. Have you seen, Verry, any\nwork for me to do here?\"\n\n\"Everything is changed. I have tried to be as steady as when mother\nwas here, but I cannot; I whirl with a vague idea of liberty. Did she\nkeep the family conscience? Now that she has gone I feel responsible\nno more.\"\n\n\"An idea of responsibility has come to me--what plain people call\nDuty.\"\n\n\"I do not feel it,\" she cried mournfully. \"I must yield to you then.\nYou can be good.'\n\n\"I must act so; but help me, Verry; I have contrary desires.\"\n\n\"What do they find to feed on? What are they? Have you your evil\nspirit?\"\n\n\"Yes; a devil named Temperament.\"\n\n\"Now teach me, Cassandra.\"\n\n\"Not I. Go, and write Ben. Make excuses for my negligence toward you\nabout his letter. Tell him to come. I shall write Alice and Helen this\nevening. We have been shut off from the world by the gate of Death;\nbut we must come back.\"\n\n\"One thing you may be sure of--though I shall be no help, I shall\nnever annoy you. I know that my instincts are fine only in a\nself-centering direction; yours are different. I shall trust them.\nSince you have spoken, I perceive the shadows you have raised and\nmust encounter. I retreat before them, admiring your discernment, and\nplacing confidence in your powers. You convince if you do not win\nme. Who can guess how your every plan and hope of well-doing may be\nthwarted? I need say no more?\"\n\n\"Nothing more.\"\n\nShe left the room. There would be no antagonism between us; but there\nwould be pain--on one side. The distance which had kept us apart was\nshortened, but not annihilated. What could I expect? The silent and\nserene currents which flow from souls like Veronica's and Ben's, whose\ngenius is not of the heart, refuse to enter a nature so turbulent as\nmine. But my destiny must be changed by such! It was taken for granted\nthat my own spirit should not rule me. And with what reward? Any, but\nthat of sympathy. But I muttered:\n\n                  \"'I dimly see\n  My far-off doubtful purpose, as a mother\n  Conjectures of the features of her child\n  Ere it is born.'\"\n\nThe house trembled in the fury of the storm. The waves were hoarse\nwith their vain bawling, and the wind shrieked at every crevice of\nchimney, door, and window. No answering excitement in me now! I had\ngrown older.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\n\nA few days after, I went to Milford with father, to make some\npurchases. I sought a way to speak to him about the future, intending\nalso to go on with various remarks; but it seemed difficult to begin.\nObserving him, as he contemplated the road before us, grave and\nabstracted, I recollected the difference between his age and mother's,\nand wondered at my blindness, while I compared the old man of my\nchildhood, who existed for the express purpose of making money for the\nsupport and pleasure of his family, and to accommodate all its whims,\nwith the man before me,--barely forty-eight, without a wrinkle in\nhis firm, ruddy face, and only an occasional white hair, in ambuscade\namong his fair, curly locks. My exclusive right over him I felt\ndoubtful about. I gave my attention to the road also, and remarked\nthat I thought the season was late.\n\n\"Yes. Why didn't Somers come home with you?\"\n\n\"I hardly know. The matter of the marriage was not settled, nor a plan\nof spending a summer abroad.\"\n\n\"Will it suit him to vegetate in Surrey? Veronica will not leave\nhome.\"\n\n\"He has no ambition.\"\n\n\"It is a curse to inherit money in this country. Mr. Somers writes\nthat Ben will have three thousand a year; but that the disposal, at\npresent, is not in his power.\"\n\nI explained as well as I could the Pickersgill property.\n\n\"I see how it is. The children are waiting for the principal, and have\nexacted the income; and their lives have been warped for this reason.\nBen has not begun life yet. But I like Somers exceedingly.\"\n\n\"He is the best of them, his mother the worst.\"\n\n\"Did you have a passage?\"\n\n\"She attempted.\"\n\n\"I can give Veronica nothing beyond new clothes or furniture; whatever\nshe likes that way. To draw money from my business is impossible. My\nbusiness fluctuates like quicksilver, and it is enormously extended.\nIf they should have two thousand a year, it would be a princely\nincome; I should feel so now, if they had it clear of incumbrance.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that your income does not amount to so much?\"\n\n\"My outgoes and incomes have for a long time been involved with each\nother. I do not separate them. I have never lived extravagantly. My\nluxury has been in doing too much.\"\n\nA cold feeling came over me.\n\n\"By the way, Mr. Somers pays you compliments in his note. How old are\nyou? I forget.\" He surveyed me with a doubtful look. Are you thin, or\nwhat is it?\"\n\n\"East wind, I guess. I am twenty-five.\"\n\n\"And Veronica?\"\n\n\"Over twenty.\"\n\n\"She must be married. I hope she will cut her practical eye-teeth\nthen, for Somers's sake.\"\n\n\"He does not require a practically minded woman.\"\n\n\"What do men require!\"\n\n\"They require the souls and bodies of women, without having the\ntrouble of knowing the difference between the one and other.\"\n\n\"So bad as that? Whoa!\"\n\nHe stopped to pay toll, and the conversation stopped.\n\nOn the way home, however, I found a place to begin my proposed talk,\nand burst out with, \"I think Hepsey should leave us.\"\n\n\"What ails Hepsey?\"\n\n\"She is so old, and is such a poke.\"\n\n\"You must tell her yourself to go. She has money enough to be\ncomfortable; I have some of it, as well as that of half the widows,\nold maids, and sailors' wives in Surrey,' being better than the\nMilford banks, they think.\"\n\nI felt another cold twinge.\n\n\"What! are our servants your creditors?\"\n\n\"Servants--don't say that,\" he said harshly; \"we do not have these\ndistinctions here.\"\n\n\"It costs you more than two thousand a year.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"Think of the hired people--the horses, the cows, pigs, hens, garden,\nfields--all costing more than they yield.\"\n\n\"What has come over you? Did you ever think of money before? Tell me,\nhave you ever been in our cellar?\"\n\n\"Yes, to look at the kittens.\"\n\n\"In the store-room?\"\n\n\"For apples and sweetmeats.\"\n\n\"Look into these matters, if you like; they never troubled your\nmother, at least I never knew that they did; but don't make your\nreforms tiresome.\"\n\nWhat encouragement!\n\nIn the yard we saw Fanny contemplating a brood of hens, which were\npicking up corn before her. \"Take Fanny for a coadjutor; she is\neighteen, and a bright girl.\" She sprang to the chaise, and caught the\nreins, which he threw into her hands, unbuckled the girth, and, before\nI was out of sight, was leading the horse to water.\n\n\"We might economize in the way of a stable-boy,\" I said.\n\n\"Pooh! you are not indulgent. Here,\" whistling to Fanny, \"let Sam do\nthat.\" She pouted her lips at him, and he laughed.\n\nAunt Merce gave me a letter the moment I entered. \"It is in Alice's\nhand; sit down and read it.\"\n\nShe took her handkerchief and a bit of flagroot from her pocket, to be\nready for the sympathetic flow which she expected. But the letter was\nshort. She had seen, it said, the announcement of mother's death in a\nnewspaper at the time. She knew what a change it had made. We might\nbe sure that we should never find our old level, however happy and\nforgetful we might grow. She bore us all in mind but sent no message,\nexcept to Aunt Merce; she must come to Rosville before summer was\nover. And could she assist me by taking Arthur for a while? Edward was\na quiet, companionable lad, and Arthur would be safe with him at home\nand at school.\n\n\"I wish you would go, Aunt Merce.\"\n\n\"Yes, why not, Mercy?\" asked father. \"Would it be a good thing for\nArthur, Cassandra? You know what Surrey is for a boy.\"\n\n\"I know what Rosville was for a girl,\" I thought. It was an excellent\nplan for Arthur; but a feeling of repulsion at the idea of his going\nkept me silent.\n\n\"Is it a good idea?\" he repeated.\n\n\"Yes, yes, father; send him by all means.\"\n\nAunt Merce sighed. \"If he goes, I must go; I can be the receptacle\nfor his griefs and trials for a while at least, and be a little useful\nthat way. You know, Locke, I am but a poor creature.\"\n\n\"I was not aware of that fact, and am astonished to hear you say so,\nMercy, when you know how far back I can remember. Mary shines all\nalong those years, and you with her.\"\n\n\"Locke, you are the kindest man in the world.\"\n\n\"He feels fifty years younger than she appears to him,\" I thought; but\nI thanked him for his consideration for her.\n\n\"Veronica has had a letter to-day from Mr. Somers. What did you buy in\nMilford?\"\n\n\"Mr. Morgeson,\" Fanny called, \"Bumpus, the horse-jockey, is in the\nyard. He says Bill is spavined. I think he lies; he wants to trade.\"\n\nHe went out with her.\n\n\"Aunt Merce, let us be more together. What do you think of spending\nour evenings in the parlor?\"\n\n\"Do you expect to break up our habits?\"\n\n\"I would if I could.\"\n\n\"Try Veronica.\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"Will she give up solitude?\"\n\n\"Bring your knitting to the parlor and see.\"\n\nVeronica came in to tell me that Ben was coming in a week.\n\n\"Glad of it.\"\n\n\"Sends love to you.\"\n\n\"Obliged.\"\n\n\"Calls me 'poor girl'; speaks beautifully of his remembrance of\nmother, and--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Tells me to rely on your faithful soul; to trust in the reasonable\nhope of our remaining together; to try to establish an equality of\ntastes and habits between us. He tells me what I never knew,--that I\nneed you--that we need each other.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"There is more for _me_.\"\n\nI left her. Closing the door of my room gently, I thought: \"Ben is a\ngood man; but for all that, I feel like blind Sampson just now. Could\nI lay my hands on the pillars which supported the temple he has built,\nI would wrench them from their foundation and surprise him by toppling\nthe roof on his head.\"\n\nHis arrival was delayed for a few days. When he came Surrey looked its\nbest, for it was June; and though the winds were chilly, the grass was\ngrown and the orchard leaves were crowding off the blossoms. The woods\nwere vividly green. The fauns were playing there, and the sirens sang\nunder the sea. But I had other thoughts; the fauns and sirens were\nnot for me, perplexed as I was with household cares. Hepsey proposed\nstaying another year, but I was firm; and she went, begging Fanny to\ngo with her and be as a daughter. She declined; but the proposition\ninfluenced her to be troublesome to me. She told me she was of age\nnow, and that no person had a right to control her. At present she was\nuseful where she was, and might remain.\n\n\"Will you have wages?\" I asked her.\n\n\"That is Mr. Morgeson's business.\"\n\nMy anger would have pleased her, so I concealed it.\n\n\"Your ability, Fanny, is better than your disposition. Me,--you do\nnot suit at all; but it is certain that father depends on you for his\nsmall comforts, and Veronica likes you. I wish you would stay.\"\n\nShe placed her arms akimbo.\n\n\"I should like to find you out, exactly. I can't. I never could find\nout your mother; all the rest of you are as clear as daylight.\" And\nshe snapped her fingers as if 'the rest' were between them.\n\n\"You lack faith.\"\n\n\"You believe that this is a beautiful world, don't you? I hate it. I\nshould think _you_ had reason, too, for hating it. Pray what have you\ngot?\"\n\n\"An ungrateful imp that was bequeathed to me.\"\n\nShe saw father in the garden beckoning me. \"He wants you. I do _not_\nhate the world always,\" she added, with her eyes fixed on him.\n\nI was disposed to trouble the still waters of our domestic life with\ntheories. Our ways were too mechanical. The old-fashioned asceticism\nwhich considered air, sleep, food, as mere necessities was stupid. But\nI had no assistance; Veronica thought that her share of my plans must\nconsist of a diligent notice of all that I did, which she gave, and\nthen went to her own life, kept sacredly apart. Fanny laughed in her\nsleeve and took another side--the practical, and shone in it, becoming\nin fact the true manager and worker, while I played. Aunt Merce was\nhelpless. She neglected her former cares; and father was, what he\nalways had been at home,--heedless and indifferent.\n\nOne morning we stood on the landing stair--Ben, Veronica, and\nmyself--looking from the window. A silver mist so thinly wrapped the\norchard that the wet, shining leaves thrust themselves through in\npatches. Birds were singing beneath, feeling the warmth of the sun,\nscarcely hid. The young leaves and blossoms steeping in the mist sent\nup a delicious odor.\n\n\"I like Surrey better and better,\" he said; \"the atmosphere suits me.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am glad,\" answered Verry. \"I could never go away. It is not\nbeautiful, I know; in fact, it is meager when it comes to be talked\nof; but there are suggestions here which occasionally stimulate me.\"\n\n\"Verry, can you keep people away from me when I live here?\"\n\n\"I do not like that feeling in you.\"\n\n\"I like fishermen.\"\n\n\"And a boat?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'll have a boat.\"\n\n\"I shall never go out with you.\"\n\n\"Cass will. I shall cruise with her, and you, in your house, need not\nsee us depart. Eric the Red made excursions in this region. We will\nskirt the shores, which are the same, nearly, as when he sailed from\nthem, with his Northmen; and the ancient barnacles will think, when\nthey see her fair hair, which she will let ripple around her stately\nshoulders, that he has come back with his bride.\"\n\nVerry looked with delight at him and then at me. \"Her long, yellow\nhair and her stately shoulders,\" she repeated.\n\n\"Will you go?\" he asked.\n\n\"Of course,\" I answered, going downstairs. I happened to look back\non the way. His arm was round Verry, but he was looking after me. He\nwithdrew it as our eyes met, and came down; but she remained, looking\nfrom the window. We went into the parlor, and I shut the door.\n\n\"Now then,\" I said.\n\nHe took a note from his pocket and gave it to me.\n\nI broke its seal, and read: \"Tell Ben, before you can reflect upon it,\nthat _I_ will go abroad, and then repent of it,--as I shall. Desmond.\"\n\n\"'Tell Ben,'\" I repeated aloud, \"'that _I_ will go abroad. Desmond.'\"\n\n\"Do you guess, as he does, that my reason for going was that I might\nbe kept aloof from all sight and sound of you and him? In the result\ntoward which I saw _you_ drive I could have no part.\"\n\n\"Stay; I know that he will go.\"\n\n\"You do not know. Nor do you know what such a man is when--\" checking\nhimself.\n\n\"He is in love?\"\n\n\"If you choose to call it that.\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\nAll there was to say should be said now; but I felt more agitated\nthan was my wont. These feelings, not according with my housewifely\ncondition, upset me. I looked at him; he began to walk about, taking\nup a book, which he leaned his head over, and whose covers he bent\nback till they cracked.\n\n\"You would read me that way,\" I said.\n\n\"It is rather your way of reading.\"\n\n\"Can you remember that Desmond and I influence each other to act\nalike? And that we comprehend each other without collision? I\nlove him, as a mature woman may love,--once, Ben, only once; the\nfire-tipped arrows rarely pierce soul and sense, blood and brain.\"\n\nHe made a gesture, expressive of contempt.\n\n\"Men are different; he is different.\"\n\n\"You have already spoken for me, and, I suppose, you will for him.\"\n\n\"I venture to. Desmond is a violent, tyrannical, sensual man; his\nperceptions are his pulses. That he is handsome, clever, resolute, and\nsings well, I can admit; but no more.\"\n\n\"We will not bandy his merits or his demerits between us. Let us\nobserve him. And now, tell me,--what am I?\"\n\n\"You have been my delight and misery ever since I knew you. I saw you\nfirst, so impetuous, yet self-contained! Incapable of insincerity,\ndevoid of affection and courageously naturally beautiful. Then, to\nmy amazement, I saw that, unlike most women, you understood your\ninstincts; that you dared to define them, and were impious enough to\nfollow them. You debased my ideal, you confused me, also, for I could\nnever affirm that you were wrong; forcing me to consult abstractions,\nthey gave a verdict in your favor, which almost unsexed you in my\nestimation. I must own that the man who is willing to marry you\nhas more courage than I have. Is it strange that when I found your\ncounterpart, Veronica, that I yielded? Her delicate, pure, ignorant\nsoul suggests to me eternal repose.\"\n\n\"It is not necessary that you should fatigue your mind with\nabstractions concerning her. It will be the literal you will hunger\nfor, dear Ben.\"\n\n\"Damn it! the world has got a twist in it, and we all go round with\nit, devilishly awry.\"\n\nI said no more. He had defined my limits, he would, as far as\npossible, control me without pity or compassion, thinking, probably,\nthat I needed none; the powers he had always given me credit for must\nbe sufficing. I could not comprehend him. How was it that he and Verry\ngave me such horrible pain? Was it exceptional? Could I claim nothing\nfrom women? Had they thought me an anomaly?--while I thought it was\nVeronica who was called peculiar and original? The end of it all must\nbe for me to assimilate with their happiness!\n\n\"Well?\" he said.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nThen Veronica came, swinging her bonnet. \"The _Sagamore_ has arrived,\nand I am going to stand on the wharf to count the sailors, and learn\nif they have all come home. Will you go, Ben?\"\n\nHe complied, and I was left alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\n\nWhen Ben left Surrey, I sent no message or letter by him, and he asked\nfor none. But at once I wrote to Desmond, and did not finish my letter\ntill after midnight. Intoxicated with the liberty my pen offered me,\nI roamed over a wide field of paper. The next morning I burnt it. But\nthere was something to be said to him before his departure, and again\nI wrote. I might have condensed still more. In this way--\n\n  VESTIGIA RETRORSUM.\n\n  CHARLES MORGESON.\n\nWhen the answer came I reflected before I read it, that it might be\nthe last link of the chain between us. Not a bright one at the best,\nnor garlanded with flowers, nor was it metal, silver, or gold. There\nwas rust on it, it was corroded, for it was forged out of his and my\nsubstance.\n\nI read it: \"I am yours, as I have been, since the night I asked you\n'How came those scars?' Did you guess that I read your story? I go\nfrom you with one idea; I love you, and I _must_ go. Brave woman! you\nhave shamed me to death almost.\"\n\nHe sent me a watch. I was to wear it from the second of July. It was\nsmall and plain, but there were a few words scratched inside the case\nwith the point of a knife, which I read every day. Veronica's eye fell\non it the first time I put it on.\n\n\"What time is it?\"\n\n\"Near one.\"\n\n\"I thought, from the look of it, that it might be near two.\"\n\n\"Don't mar my ideal of you, Verry, by growing witty.\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders. \"I guess you found it washed ashore, among\nthe rocks; was it bruised?\"\n\n\"A man gave it to me.\"\n\n\"A merman, who fills the sea-halls with a voice of power?\"\n\n\"May be.\"\n\n\"Tut, Ben gave it to you. It is a kind of housekeepish present; did he\nadd scissors and needle-case?\"\n\n\"What if the merman should take me some day to the 'pale sea-groves\nstraight and high?'\"\n\n\"You must never, never go. You cannot leave me, Cass!\" She grasped my\nsleeve, and pulled me round. \"How much was there for you to do in the\nlife before us, which you talked about?\"\n\n\"I remember. There is much, to be sure.\"\n\nFanny's quick eye caught the glitter of the watch. The mystery teased\nher, but she said nothing.\n\nAunt Merce had gone to Rosville with Arthur. There was no visitor with\nus; there had been none beside Ben since mother died. All seemed kept\nat bay. I wrote to Helen to come and pass the summer, but her child\nwas too young for such a journey, she concluded. Ben had sailed for\nSwitzerland. The summer, whose biography like an insignificant life\nmust be written in a few words, was a long one to live through. It\nhappened to be a dry season, which was unfrequent on our coast. Days\nrolled by without the variation of wind, rain, or hazy weather. The\nsky was an opaque blue till noon, when solid white clouds rose in the\nnorth, and sailed seaward, or barred the sunset, which turned them\ncrimson and black. The mown fields grew yellow under the stare of\nthe brassy sun, and the leaves cracked and curled for the want of\nmoisture. It was dull in the village, no ships were building, none\nsailed, none arrived. But father was more absorbed than ever, more\naway from home. He wrote often in the evening, and pored over ledgers\nwith his bookkeeper. Late at night I found him sorting and reading\npapers. He forgot us. But Fanny, as he grew forgetful, improved as\nhousekeeper. Her energy was untiring; she waited so much on him that\nI grew forgetful of him. Veronica was the same as before; her room\nwas pleasant with color and perfume, the same delicate pains with her\ndress each day was taken. She looked as fair as a lily, as serene as\nthe lake on which it floats, except when Fanny tried her. With me she\nnever lost temper. But I saw little of her; she was as fixed in her\nindividual pursuits as ever.\n\nThere were intervals now when all my grief for mother returned, and\nI sat in my darkened chamber, recalling with a sad persistence her\ngestures, her motions, the tones of her voice, through all the past\nback to my first remembrance. The places she inhabited, her opinions\nand her actions I commented on with a minuteness that allowed no\ndetail to escape. When my thoughts turned from her, it seemed as if\nshe were newly lost in the vast and wandering Universe of the Dead,\nwhence I had brought her.\n\nIn September a letter came from Ben, which promised a return by the\nlast of October. With the ruffling autumnal breezes my stagnation\nvanished, and I began my shore life again in a mood which made memory\nlike hope; but staying out too late one evening, I came home in a\nchill. From the chill I went to a fever, which lasted some days.\nVeronica came every day to see me, and groaned over my hair, which\nfell off, but she could not stay long, the smell of medicine made her\nill, the dark room gave her an uneasiness; besides, she did not know\nwhat she should say. I sent her away always. Fanny took care of me\ntill I was able to move about the room, then she absented herself most\nof the time. One afternoon Veronica came to tell me that Margaret, the\nIrish girl, was going; she supposed that Fanny was insufferable, and\nthat she could not stay.\n\n\"I must be well by to-morrow,\" I said.\n\nThe next day I went down stairs, and was greeted with the epithet of\n\"Scarecrow.\"\n\n\"Do you feel pretty strong?\" asked Fanny, with a peculiar accent, when\nwe happened to be alone.\n\n\"What is the matter? Out with it!\"\n\n\"Something's going to turn up here; something ails Mr. Morgeson.\"\n\nI guess his ailment.\n\n\"He is going to fail, he is smashed all to nothing. He knows what will\nbe said about him, yet he goes about with perfect calmness. But he\nfeels it. I tried him this morning, I gave him tea instead of coffee,\nand he didn't know it!\"\n\n\"Margaret's gone?\"\n\n\"There must be rumors; for she asked him for her wages a day or two\nago. He paid her, and said she had better go.\"\n\nI examined my hands involuntarily. She tittered.\n\n\"How easily you will wash the long-necked glasses and pitchers, with\nyour slim hand!\"\n\nI dropped into a mental calculation, respecting the cost of an\nentire change of wardrobe suitable to our reduced circumstances, and\nspeculated on a neat cottage-style of cookery.\n\n\"I think I must go, too,\" she said with cunning eyes.\n\n\"How can you bear to, when there will be so much trouble for you to\nenjoy?\"\n\n\"How tired you look, Cass,\" said Veronica, slipping in quietly. \"What\nare you talking about? Has Fanny been tormenting you?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she answered. \"But if am not mistaken, you will be\ntormented by others besides me.\"\n\n\"Go out!\" said Veronica. \"Leave us, pale pest.\"\n\n\"You may want me here yet.\"\n\n\"What does she mean, Cass?\"\n\nI hesitated.\n\n\"Tell me,\" she said, in her imperative, gentle voice. \"What is there\nthat I cannot know?\"\n\n\"Now she is what you call high-toned, isn't it?\" inquired Fanny.\n\nVeronica threw her book at her.\n\n\"The truth is, ladies, that your father, the principal man in Surrey,\nis not worth a dollar. What do you think of it? And how will you come\noff the high horse?\" And Fanny drummed on the table energetically.\n\n\"Did you really think of going, Fanny?\" asked Veronica. \"You will\nstay, and do better than ever, for if you attempt to go, I shall bring\nyou back.\"\n\nThis was the invitation she wanted, and was satisfied with.\n\n\"I must give up flowers,\" said Veronica, \"of course.\"\n\n\"I wonder if we shall keep pigs this fall?\" said Fanny. \"Must we sit\nin the free seats in the meeting-house? It will be fine for the boys\nto drop paper balls on our heads from the gallery. I'd like to see\nthem do it, though,\" she concluded, as if she felt that such an insult\nwould infringe upon her rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\n\nIt was true. Locke Morgeson had been insolvent for five years. All\nthis time he had thrown ballast out from every side in the shape\nof various ventures, which he trusted would lighten the ship, that,\nnevertheless, drove steadily on to ruin. Then he steered blindly,\nstraining his credit to the utmost; and then--the crash. His losses\nwere so extended and gradual that the public were not aware of his\ncondition till he announced it. There was a general exasperation\nagainst him. The Morgeson family rose up with one accord to represent\nthe public mind, which drove Veronica wild.\n\n\"Have you acted wrongly, father?\" she asked.\n\n\"I have confessed, Verry, will that suit you!\"\n\nOur house was thronged for several days. \"Pay us,\" cried the female\nportion of his creditors. In vain father represented that he was still\nyoung--that his business days were not over--that they must wait, for\npaid they should be. \"Pay us now, for we are women,\" they still cried.\nFanny opened the doors for these persons as wide as possible when they\ncame, and shut them with a bang when they went, astonishing them\nwith a satirical politeness, or confounding them with an impertinent\nsilence. The important creditors held meetings to agree what should\nbe done, and effected an arrangement by which his property was left\nin his hands for three years, to arrange for the benefit of his\ncreditors. The arrangement proved that his integrity was not\nsuspected; but it was an ingenious punishment, that he should keep in\nsight, improve, or change, for others, what had been his own. I was\nglad when he decided to sell his real estate and personal property,\nand trust to the ships alone, but would build no more. I begged him to\nkeep our house till Ben should return. He consented to wait; but I\ndid not tell Verry what I had done. All the houses he owned, lots,\ncarriages, horses, domestic stock, the fields lying round our\nhouse--were sold. When he began to sell, the fury of retrenchment\nseized him, and he laid out a life of self-denial for us three.\nArthur's ten thousand dollars were safe, who was therefore provided\nfor. He would bring wood and water for us; the rest we must do, with\nFanny's help. We could dine in the kitchen, and put our beds in one\nroom; by shutting up the house in part, we should have less labor\nto perform. We attempted to carry out his ideas, but Veronica was so\ndreadfully in Fanny's way and mine, that we were obliged to entreat\nher to resume her old r\u00c3\u00b4le. As for Fanny, she was happy--working\nlike a beaver day and night. Father was much at home, and took an\nextraordinary interest in the small details that Fanny carried out.\n\nWhen Temperance heard of these arrangements, she came down with Abram\nin their green and yellow wagon. Temperance drove the shaggy old white\nhorse, for Abram was intrusted with the care of a meal bag, in which\nwere fastened a cock and four hens. We should see, she said when she\nlet them out, whether we were to keep hens or not. Was Veronica to go\nwithout new-laid eggs? Had he sold the cat, she sarcastically inquired\nof father.\n\n\"Who is going to do your washing, girls?\" she asked, taking off her\nbonnet.\n\n\"We all do it.\"\n\n\"Now I shall die a-laughing!\" But she contradicted herself by crying\nheartily. \"One day in every week, I tell _you_, I am coming; and Fanny\nand I can do the washing in a jiffy.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Abram, \"you can; the sass is in.\"\n\n\"Sass or no sass, I'm coming.\"\n\nShe made me laugh for the first time in a month. I was too tired\ngenerally to be merry, with my endeavors to carry out father's wishes,\nand keep up the old aspect of the house. When she left us we all felt\nmore cheerful. Aunt Merce wanted to come home, but Verry and I thought\nshe had better stay at Rosville. We could not deny it to ourselves,\nthat home was sadly altered, or that we were melancholy; and though\nwe never needed her more, we begged her not to come. Happily father's\nzeal soon died away. A boy was hired, and as there was no out-of-doors\nwork for him to do, he relieved Fanny, who in her turn relieved\nme. Finding time to look into myself, I perceived a change in my\nestimation of father; a vague impression of weakness in him troubled\nme. I also discovered that I had lost my atmosphere. My life was\ncoarse, hard, colorless! I lived in an insignificant country\nvillage; I was poor. My theories had failed; my practice was like my\nmoods--variable. But I concluded that if _to-day_ would go on without\nbestowing upon me sharp pains, depriving me of sleep, mutilating me\nwith an accident, or sending a disaster to those belonging to me, I\nwould be content. Arthur held out a hope, by writing me, that he meant\nto support me handsomely. He wished me to send him some shirt studs;\nand told me to keep the red horse. He had heard that I was very\nhandsome when I was in Rosville. A girl had asked him how I looked\nnow. When he told her I was handsomer than any woman Rosville could\nboast of, she laughed.\n\nOctober had gone, and we had not heard from Ben. Veronica came to my\nroom of nights, and listened to wind and sea, as she never had before.\nSometimes she was there long after I had gone to bed, to look out of\nthe windows. If it was calm, she went away quietly; if the sea was\nrough, she was sorrowful, but said nothing. The lethargic summer had\ngiven way to a boisterous autumn of cold, gray weather, driving rains,\nand hollow gales. At last he came--to Veronica first. He gave a deep\nbreath of delight when he stood again on the hearth-rug, before our\nnow unwonted parlor fire. The sight of his ruddy face, vigorous form,\nand gay voice made me as merry as the attendants of a feast are when\nthey inhale the odor of the viands they carry, hear the gurgle of the\nwine they pour, and echo the laughter of the guests.\n\nThere was much to tell that astonished him, but he could not be\ndepressed; everything must be arranged to suit us. He would buy the\nhouse, provided he could pay for it in instalments. Did I know that\nhis mother had docked his allowance as soon as she knew that he would\nmarry Verry?\n\n\"How should I know it?\"\n\nI had not heard then that Desmond's was doubled, when she heard his\nintention of going to Spain.\n\n\"How should I know that?\"\n\nOne thing I should learn, however--and that was, that Desmond had\nbegged his mother to make no change in the disposition of her income.\nHe had declined the extra allowance, and then accepted it, to offer\nhim--Ben. Was not that astonishing?\n\n\"Did you take it?\"\n\n\"No; but pa did.\"\n\nAll he could call his was fifteen hundred a year. Was that enough for\nthem to live on, and pay a little every year for the house? Could we\nall live there together, just the same? Would we, he asked father, and\nallow him to be an inmate?\n\nFather shook hands with him so violently that he winced; and Verry\ncrumpled up a handful of his tawny locks and kissed them, whereat he\nsaid: \"Are you grown a human woman?\"\n\nAbout the wedding? He could only stay to appoint a time, for he must\npost to Belem. It must be very soon.\n\n\"In a year or two,\" said Verry.\n\n\"Verry!\"\n\n\"In three weeks, then.\"\n\n\"From to-day?\"\n\n\"No, that will be the date of the wreck of the _Locke Morgeson_; but\nthree weeks from to-morrow. Must we have anybody here, Ben?\"\n\n\"Helen, and Alice, Cassandra?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"I have no friends,\" said Verry.\n\n\"What will you wear, Verry?\" I asked.\n\n\"Why, this dress,\" designating her old black silk. Her eyes filled\nwith tears, and went on a pilgrimage toward the unknown heaven where\nour mother was. _She_ could only come to the wedding as a ghost. I\nimagined her flitting through the empty spaces, from room to room,\nscared and troubled by the pressure of mortal life around her.\n\n\"I shall not wear white,\" Verry said hastily.\n\nThe very day Ben went to Belem one of father's outstanding ships\narrived. She came into the harbor presenting the unusual sight of\ntrying oil on deck. Black and greasy from hull to spar, she was a\npleasant sight, for she was full of sperm oil. Little boys ran down to\nthe house to inform us of that fact before she was moored. \"Wouldn't\nMr. Morgeson be all right now that his luck had changed?\" they asked.\n\nAt supper father said \"By George!\" several times, by that oath\nresuming something of his old self. \"Those women can now be paid,\" he\nsaid. \"If I could have held out till now, I could have gone on without\nfailing. This is the first good voyage the _Oswego_ ever made me; if\nanother ship, the _Adamant_, will come full while oil is high, I shall\narrange matters with my creditors before the three years are up. To\nhold my own again--ah! I never will venture all upon the uncertain\nfield of the sea.\"\n\nThe _Oswego's_ captain sent us a box of shells next day, and a small\nPortuguese boy, named Manuel--a handsome, black-eyed, husky-voiced\nfellow, in a red shirt, which was bound round his waist with a leather\nbelt, from which hung a sailor's sheath-knife.\n\n\"He is volcanic,\" said Verry.\n\n\"The Portuguese are all handsome,\" said Fanny, poking him, to see if\nhe would notice it. But he did not remove his eyes from Veronica.\n\n\"He shall be your page, Verry.\"\n\nThe next night a message came to us that Abram was dying. If we ever\nmeant to come, Temperance sent word, some of us might come now; but\nshe would rather have Mr. Morgeson. Fanny insisted upon going with him\nto carry a lantern. Manuel offered her his knife, when he comprehended\nthat she was going through a dark road.\n\n\"You are a perfect heathen. There's nothing to be afraid of, except\nthat Mr. Morgeson may walk into a ditch; will a knife keep us out of\nthat?\"\n\n\"Knife is good--it kills,\" he said, showing his white, vegetable-ivory\nteeth.\n\nVerry and I sat up till they returned, at two in the morning. Abram\nhad died about midnight, distressed to the last with worldly cares.\n\"He asked,\" said father, \"if I remembered his poor boy, whose chest\nnever came home, and wished to hear some one read a hymn; Temperance\nbroke down when I read it, while Fanny cried hysterically.\"\n\n\"I was freezing cold,\" she answered haughtily.\n\nIn the morning Verry and I started for Temperance's house; but she\nwaited on the doorstep till I had inquired whether we were wanted. I\ncalled her in, for Temperance asked for her as soon as she saw me.\n\n\"He was a good man, girls,\" she said with emphasis.\n\n\"Indeed he was.\"\n\n\"A little mean, I spose.\"\n\nI put in a demurrer; her face cleared instantly.\n\n\"He thought a great deal of your folks.\"\n\n\"And a great deal of you.\"\n\n\"Oh, what a loss I have met with! He had just bought a first-rate\novercoat.\"\n\n\"But Temperance,\" said Verry, with a lamentable candor, \"you can come\nback now.\"\n\n\"Can't you wait for him to be put into the ground?\" And she tried to\nlook shocked, but failed.\n\nA friend entered with a doleful face, and Temperance groaned slightly.\n\n\"It is all done complete now, Mis Handy. He looks as easy as if he\nslept, he was _so_ limber.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" answered Temperance, starting up, and hurrying us out\nof the room, pinching me, with a significant look at Verry. She was\nafraid that her feelings might be distressed. \"The funeral will be day\nafter to-morrow. Don't come; your father will be all that must be here\nof the family. I shall shut up the house and come straight to you. I\nknow that I am needed; but you mustn't say a word about pay--I can't\nstand it, I have had too much affliction to be pestered about wages.\"\n\nVerry hugged her, and Temperance shed the honestest tears of the day\nthen, she was so gratified at Verry's fondness. Before Abram had been\nburied a week, she was back again--a fixture, although she declared\nthat she had only come for a spell, as we might know by the size\nof the bundle she had, showing us one, tied in a blue cotton\nhandkerchief. What should she stay from her own house for, when as\ngood a man as ever lived left it to her? We knew that she merely\ncomforted a tender conscience by praising the departed, for whom she\nhad small respect when living. We felt her brightening influence, but\nFanny sulked, feeling dethroned.\n\nBen Pickersgill Somers and Veronica Morgeson were \"published.\"\nContrary to the usual custom, Verry went to hear her own banns read\nat the church. She must do all she could, she told me, to realize that\nshe was to be married; had I any thoughts about it, with which I might\naid her? She thought it strange that people should marry, and could\nnot decide whether it was the sublimest or the most inglorious act of\none's life. I begged her to think about what she should wear--the time\nwas passing. Father gave me so small a sum for the occasion, I had\nlittle opportunity for the splendid; but I purchased what Veronica\nwanted for a dress, and superintended the making of it--black lace\nover lavender-colored silk. She said no more about it; but I observed\nthat she put in order all her possessions, as if she were going to\nundertake a long and uncertain journey. Every box and drawer was\narranged. All her clothes were repaired, refolded, and laid away;\nevery article was refreshed by a turn or shake-up. She made her room a\nmiracle of cleanliness. What she called rubbish she destroyed--her old\npapers, things with chipped edges, or those that were defaced by wear.\nShe went once to Milford in the time, and bought a purple Angola rug,\nwhich she put before her arm-chair, and two small silver cups, with\ncovers; in one was a perfume which Ben liked, the other was empty.\nHer favorite blank-books were laid on a shelf, and the table, with its\ninkstand and portfolio, was pushed against the wall. The last ornament\nwhich she added to her room was a beautifully woven mat of evergreens,\nwith which she concealed the picture of the avenue and the nameless\nman. After it was done, she inhabited my room, appearing to feel at\nhome, and glad to have me with her. As the time drew near, she grew\nsilent, and did not play at all. Temperance watched her with anxiety.\n\"If ever she can have one of those nervous spells again she will have\none now,\" she said. \"Don't let her dream. I am turning myself inside\nout to keep up her appetite.\"\n\n\"Do you ever feel worried about _me_, Tempy?\"\n\n\"Lord 'a marcy! you great, strong thing, why should I? May be you do\nwant a little praise. I never saw anybody get along as well as you do,\nnowadays; you have altered very much; I never would have believed it.\"\n\n\"What _was_ the trouble with me?\"\n\n\"_I_ always stuck up for you, gracious knows. Do you know what has\nbeen said of you in Surrey?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then I shan't tell you; if I were you, though, I shouldn't trouble\nmyself to be overpolite to the folks who have come and gone here, nigh\non to twenty years,--hang 'em!\"\n\nA few days before the wedding Aunt Merce and Arthur came home. Arthur\nwas shy at first regarding the great change, but being agreeably\ndisappointed, grew lively. I perceived that Aunt Merce had aged since\nmother's death; her manner was changed; the same objects no longer\npossessed an interest. She looked at me penitentially. \"I wish I\ncould say,\" she said, \"what I used to say to you,--that you were\n'possessed.' Now that there is no occasion for me to comprehend\npeople, I begin to. My education began wrong end foremost. I think\nMary's death has taught me something. Do you think of her? She was the\nlove of my life.\"\n\n\"Women do keep stupid a long time; but I think they are capable of\ngrowth, beyond the period when men cease to grow or change.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know anything about men, you know.\"\n\nTemperance and I cleaned the house, opened every room, and made every\nfire-place ready for a fire--a fire being the chief luxury which I\ncould command. Baking went on up to within a day of the wedding, under\nHepsey's supervision, who had been summoned as a helper; Fanny was\nbusy everywhere.\n\n\"Mr. Morgeson,\" said Temperance, \"the furniture is too darned shabby\nfor a wedding.\"\n\n\"It is not mine, you must remember.\"\n\n\"Plague take the creditors! they know as well as I that you turned\nSurrey from a herring-weir into a whaling-port, and that the houses\nthey live in were built out of the wages you gave them. I am thankful\nthat most of them have water in their cellars.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\n\nThe day came. Alice Morgeson, and Helen with her baby, arrived the\nnight before; and Ben and Mr. Somers drove from Milford early in the\nafternoon. Mr. Somers was affable and patronizing. When introduced to\nVeronica, he betrayed astonishment. \"She is not like you, Cassandra.\nAre you in delicate health, my dear!\" addressing her.\n\n\"I have a peculiar constitution, I believe.\" He made excuses to her\nfor Mrs. Somers and his daughters to which she answered not a word.\nHe was in danger of being embarrassed, and I enticed him away from\nher--not before she whispered gravely, \"Why did _he_ come?\" I went\nover the house with him, he remarking on its situation, for sun and\nshade, and protection from, or exposure to, the winds; and tasting\nthe water, pronounced it excellent. He thought I had a true idea of\nhospitality; the fires everywhere proclaimed that. Temperance had the\nair of a retainer; there was an atmosphere about our premises which\nplaced them at a distance from the present. Then Alice came to my\nassistance and entertained him so well that I could leave him.\n\nWe had invited a few friends and relations to witness the ceremony, at\neight o'clock. I had been consulted so often on various matters that\nit was dark before I finished my tasks. The last was to arrange some\nflowers I had ordered in Milford. I kept a bunch of them in reserve\nfor Verry's plate; for we were to have a supper, at father's request,\nwho thought it would be less tiresome to feed the guests than to talk\nto them. Verry did not know this, though she had asked several times\nwhy we were all so busy.\n\nIt was near seven when I went upstairs to find her. Temperance had\nsent Manuel and Fanny to the different rooms with tea, bread and\nbutter, and the message that it was all we were to have at present.\nBen had been extremely silent since his arrival, and disposed to\nreading. I looked over his shoulder once, and saw that it was \"Scott's\nLife of Napoleon\" he perused; and an hour after, being obliged to ask\nhim a question, saw him still at the same page. He was now dressing\nprobably. Helen and Alice were in their rooms. Mr. Somers was napping\non the parlor sofa; father was meditating at his old post in the\ndining-room and smoking. It was a familiar picture; but there was\na rent in the canvas and a figure was missing--she who had been its\nlight!\n\nI found Verry sound asleep on the sofa in my room.\n\nA glass full of milk was on the floor beside her, and a plate with a\nslice of bread. The lamp had been lighted by some one, and carefully\nshaded from her face. She had been restless, I thought, for her hair\nhad fallen out of the comb and half covered her face, which was like\nmarble in its whiteness and repose. Her right arm was extended; I took\nher hand, and her warm, humid fingers closed over mine.\n\n\"Wake up, Verry; it is time to be married.\"\n\nShe opened her eyes without stirring and fixed them upon me. \"Do you\nknow any man who is like Ben? Or was it he whom I have just left in\nthe dark world of sleep?\"\n\n\"I know his brother, who is like him, but dark in complexion--and his\nhair is black.\"\n\n\"His hair is not black.\"\n\nI rushed out of the room, muttering some excuse, came back and\narranged her toilette; but she remained with her arm still extended,\nand continued:\n\n\"It was a strange place where we met; curious, dusty old trees grew\nabout it. He was cutting the back of one with a dagger, and the pieces\nhe carved out fell to the ground, as if they were elastic. He made me\npick them up, though I wished to listen to a man who was lying under\none of the trees, wrapped in a cloak, keeping time with _his_ dagger,\nand singing a wild air.\n\n\"'What do you see?' said the first.\n\n\"'A letter on every piece,' I answered, and spelt Cassandra. 'Are you\nBen transformed?' I asked, for he had his features, his air, though\nhe was a swarthy, spare man, with black, curly hair, dashed with gray;\nbut he pricked my arm with his dagger, and said, 'Go on.' I picked up\nthe rest, and spelt 'Somers.'\n\n\"'Cassandra Somers! now tell her,' he whispered, turning me gently\nfrom him, with a hand precisely like Ben's.\"\n\n\"No, it is handsomer,\" I muttered.\n\n\"Before me was a space of sea. Before I crossed I wanted to hear that\nwild music; but your voice broke my dream.\"\n\nShe sat up and unbuttoned her sleeve. _As I live_, there was a red\nmark on her arm above her elbow!\n\nI crushed my hands together and set my teeth, for I would have kissed\nthe mark and washed it with my tears. But Verry must not be agitated\nnow. She divined my feelings for the first time in her life. \"I have\nindeed been in a long sleep, as far _you_ are concerned; this means\nsomething. My blindness is removed by a dream. Do you despise me?\" Two\nlarge, limpid tears dropped down her smooth cheeks without ruffling\nthe expression of her face.\n\n\"I have prided myself upon my delicacy of feeling. You may have\nremarked that I considered myself your superior?\"\n\n\"You are all wrong. I have no delicate feelings at all; they are as\ncoarse and fibrous as the husk of a cocoanut. Do for heaven's sake get\nup and let me dress you.\"\n\nShe burst into laughter. \"Bring me some water, then.\"\n\nI brought her a bowl full, and stood near her with a towel; but\nshe splashed it over me, and dribbled her hands in it till I was in\ndespair. I took it away and wiped her face, which looked at me so\nchildly, so elfish, so willful, and so tenderly, that I took it\nbetween my hands and kissed it. I pulled her up to a chair, for she\nwas growing willful every moment; but she must be humored. I combed\nher hair, put on her shoes and stockings, and in short dressed her.\nFather came up and begged me to hurry, as everybody had come. I sent\nhim for Ben, who came with a pale, happy face and shining eyes. She\nlooked at him seriously. \"I like you best,\" she said.\n\n\"It _is_ time you said that. Oh, Verry! how lovely you are!\"\n\n\"I feel so.\"\n\n\"Come, come,\" urged father.\n\n\"I do not want these gloves,\" she said, dropping them.\n\nBen slipped on the third finger of her left hand a plain ring. She\nkissed it, and he looked as if about to be translated.\n\n\"Forever, Verry?\"\n\n\"Forever.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" I said, \"I want a collar,\" giving a glance into the\nglass. What a starved, thin, haggard face I saw, with its border of\npale hair! Whose were those wide, pitiful, robbed eyes?\n\nI hurried into the room in advance to show them their place in front\nof a screen of plants. When they entered the company rose, and the\nceremony was performed. Veronica's dress was commented upon and not\napproved of; being black, it was considered ominous. She looked like\na 'cloud with a silver lining.' I also made my comments. Temperance,\nwhose tearful eyes were fixed on her darling, was unconscious that she\nhad taken from her pocket, and was flourishing, a large red and yellow\nsilk handkerchief, while the cambric one she intended to use was\nneatly folded in her left hand. She wore the famous plum-colored silk,\nold style, which had come into a fortune in the way of wrinkles. A\nlarge bow of black ribbon testified that she was in mourning. Hepsey\nrubbed her thumb across her fingers with the vacant air of habit. I\nglanced at Alice; she was looking intently at Fanny, whose eyes were\nfixed upon father. A strange feeling of annoyance troubled me, but\nthe ceremony was over. Arthur congratulated himself on having a big\nbrother. Ben was so pale, and wore so exalted an expression, that he\nagitated me almost beyond control.\n\nAfter the general shaking of hands, there came retorts for me. \"When\nshall we have occasion to congratulate you?\" And, \"You are almost at\nthe corner.\" And, \"Your traveling from home seems only to have been an\nadvantage to Veronica.\"\n\n\"I tell you, Cousin Sue,\" said Arthur, who overheard the last remark,\n\"that you don't know what they say of Cassandra in Rosville. She's the\nbiggest beauty they ever had, and had lots of beaus.\"\n\nA significant expression passed over Cousin Sue's face, which was\nnoticed by Alice Morgeson, who colored deeply.\n\n\"Have you not forgotten?\" I asked her.\n\n\"It was of you I thought, not myself. I cannot tell you how utterly\nthe past has gone, or how insignificant the result has proved.\"\n\n\"Alice,\" said father, \"can you carve?\"\n\n\"Splendidly.\"\n\n\"Come and sit at the foot of my table; Mr. Somers will take charge of\nthe smaller one.\"\n\n\"With pleasure.\"\n\n\"Slip out,\" whispered Fanny, \"and look at the table; Temperance wants\nyou.\"\n\n\"For the Lord's sake!\" cried Temperance, \"say whether things are\nship-shape.\"\n\nI was surprised at the taste she had displayed, and told her so.\n\n\"For once I have tried to do my best,\" she said; \"all for Verry. Call\n'em in; the turkeys will be on in a whiffle.\"\n\nTables were set in the hall, as well as in the dining-room. \"They\nmust sit down,\" she continued, \"so that they may eat their victuals\nin peace.\" The supper was a relief to Veronica, and I blessed\nfather's forethought. Nobody was exactly merry, but there was a proper\ncheerfulness. Temperance, Fanny, and Manuel were in attendance; the\nlatter spilled a good deal of coffee on the carpet in his enjoyment of\nthe scene; and when he saw Veronica take the flowers in her hand, he\nexclaimed, \"Santa Maria!\"\n\nEverybody turned to look at him.\n\n\"What are you doing here, Manuel?\" asked Ben.\n\n\"I wait on the se\u00c3\u00b1oritas,\" he answered. \"Take plum-duff?\"\n\nEverybody laughed.\n\n\"Do you like widows?\" whispered Fanny at the back of my chair. I made\na sign to her to attend to her business, but, as she suggested, looked\nat Alice. At that moment she and father were drinking wine together. I\nthought her handsomer than ever; she had expanded into a fair, smooth\nmiddle age.\n\nThe talking and clattering melted vaguely into my ears; I was a\nlay-figure in the scene, and my soul wandered elsewhere. Mr. Somers\nbegan to fidget gently, which father perceiving, rose from the table.\nSoon after the guests departed. The remains of the feast vanished; the\nfires burnt down, \"winding sheets\" wrapped the flame of the candles,\nand suppressed gaping set in.\n\nThe flowers, left to themselves, began to give out odors which\nperfumed the rooms. I went about extinguishing the waning candles and\nstifling the dying fires, finished my work, and was going upstairs\nwhen I heard Veronica playing, and stopped to listen. It was not a\npaean nor a lament that she played, but a fluctuating, vibratory air,\nexpressive of mutation. I hung over the stair-railing after she had\nceased, convinced that she had been playing for herself a farewell,\nwhich freed me from my bond to her. Mr. Somers came along the hall\nwith a candle, and I waited to ask him if I could do anything for his\ncomfort.\n\n\"My dear,\" he said with apprehension, \"your sister is a genius, I\nthink.\"\n\n\"In music--yes.\"\n\n\"What a deplorable thing for a woman!\"\n\n\"A woman of genius is but a heavenly lunatic, or an anomaly sphered\nbetween the sexes; do you agree?\"\n\nHe laughed, and pushed his spectacles up on his forehead.\n\n\"My dear, I am astonished that Ben's choice fell as it did--\"\n\n\"Good-night, sir,\" I said so loudly that he almost dropped his candle,\nand I retired to my room, taking a chair by the fire, with a sigh of\nrelief. After a while Ben and Veronica came up.\n\n\"It is a cold night,\" I remarked.\n\n\"I am in an enchanted palace,\" said Ben, \"where there is no weather.\"\n\n\"Cassy, will you take these pins out of my hair?\" asked Verry, seating\nherself in an easy-chair. \"Ben, we will excuse you.\"\n\n\"How good of you.\" He strode across the passage, went into her room,\nand shut the door.\n\n\"There, Verry, I have unbound your hair.\"\n\n\"But I want to talk.\"\n\nI took her hand, and led her out. She stood before her door for a\nmoment silently, and then gave a little knock. No answer came. She\nknocked again; the same silence as before. At last she was obliged to\nopen it herself, and enter without any bidding.\n\n\"Which will rule?\" I thought, as I slipped down the back stairs, and\nlistened at the kitchen door. I heard nothing. Finding an old cloak\nin the entry, I wrapped myself in it and left the house. The moon was\nout-riding black, scudding clouds, and the wind moaned round the sea,\nwhich looked like a vast, wrinkled serpent in the moonlight.\n\nI walked to Gloster Point, and rested under the lee of the lighthouse,\nbut could not, when I made the attempt, see to read the inscription\ninside my watch, by the light of the lantern. I must have fallen\nasleep from fatigue, still holding it in my hand; for when I started\nhomeward, there was a pale reflection of light in the east, and the\nsea was creeping quietly toward it with a murmuring morning song.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\n\nI looked across the bay from my window. \"The snow is making 'Pawshee's\nLand' white again, and I remain this year the same. No change, no\ngrowth or development! The fulfillment of duty avails me nothing; and\nself-discipline has passed the necessary point.\"\n\nI struck the sash with my closed hand, for I would now give my life a\nnew direction, and it was fettered. But I would be resolute, and break\nthe fetters; had I not endured a \"mute case\" long enough? Manuel, who\nhad been throwing snowballs against the house, stopped, and looked\ntoward the gate, and then ran toward it. A pair of tired, splashed\nhorses dashed down the drive. Manuel had the reins, and Ben was beside\nhim, reeling slightly on the seat of the wagon. I ran down to meet\nhim; he had been on a trip to Belem, where he never went except when\nhe wanted money.\n\n\"I have some news for you,\" he said, putting his arm in mine, as he\njumped from the wagon. \"Come in, and pull off my boots, Manuel.\" I\nbrought a chair for him, and waited till his boots were off. \"Bring me\na glass of brandy.\"\n\nI stamped my foot. Verry entered with a book. \"Ah, Verry, darling,\ncome here.\"\n\n\"Why do you drink brandy? Have you over-driven the horses?\"\n\nHe drank the brandy. She nodded kindly to him, shut her book, and\nslipped out, without approaching him.\n\n\"That's _her_ way,\" he said, staring hard at me. \"She always says in\nthe same unmoved voice, 'Why do you drink brandy?'\"\n\n\"And then--she will not come to kiss you.\"\n\n\"The child is dead, for the first thing. (Cigar, Manuel.) Second,\nI was possessed to come home by the way of Rosville. When did your\nfather go away, Cass?\"\n\nI felt faint, and sat down.\n\n\"Ah, we _all_ have a weakness; does yours overcome you?\"\n\n\"He went three days ago.\"\n\n\"I saw him at Alice Morgeson's.\"\n\n\"Arthur?\"\n\n\"He didn't go to see Arthur. He will marry Alice, and I must build my\nhouse now.\"\n\nA devil ripped open my heart; its fragments flew all over me, blinding\nand deafening me.\n\n\"He will be home to-night.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"What shall you say, Cassy?\"\n\n\"Expose that little weakness to him.\"\n\n\"When will you learn real life?\"\n\n\"Please ask him, when he comes, if he will see me in my room.\"\n\nI waited there. My cup was filled at last. My sin swam on the top.\n\nFather came in smoking, and taking a chair between his legs, sat\nopposite me, and tapped softly the back of it with his fingers. \"You\nsent for me?\"\n\n\"I wanted to tell you that Charles Morgeson loved me from the first,\nand you remember that I stayed by him to the last.\"\n\n\"What more is there?\" knocking over the chair, and seizing me; \"tell\nme.\"\n\nHis eyes, that were bloodshot with anger, fastened on my mouth. \"I\nknow, though, damn him! I know his cunning. Was Alice aware of this?\"\nAnd he pushed me backward.\n\n\"All.\"\n\nAn expression of pain and disappointment crossed his face; he ground\nhis teeth fiercely.\n\n\"Don't marry her, father; you will kill me if you do!\"\n\n\"Must you alone have license?\"\n\nHe resumed his cigar, which he picked up from the floor.\n\n\"It would seem that we have not known each other. What evasiveness\nthere is in our natures! Your mother was the soul of candor, yet I am\nconvinced I never knew her.\"\n\n\"If you bring Alice here, I must go. We cannot live together.\"\n\n\"I understand why she would not come here. She said that she must see\nyou first. She is in Milford.\"\n\nHe knocked the ashes from his cigar, looked round the room, and then\nat me, who wept bitterly. His face contracted with a spasm.\n\n\"We were married two days ago.\" And turning from me quickly, he left\nthe room.\n\nI was never so near groveling on the face of the earth as then; let me\nbut fall, and I was sure that I never should rise.\n\nBen knew it, but left it to me to tell Veronica.\n\nMy grief broke all bounds, and we changed places; she tried to comfort\nme, forgetting herself.\n\n\"Let us go away to the world's end with Ben.\" But suddenly\nrecollecting that she liked Alice, she cried, \"What shall I do?\"\n\nWhat could she do, but offer an unreasoning opposition? Aunt Merce\ncried herself sick, fond as she was of Alice, and Temperance declared\nthat if she hadn't married a widower herself, she would put in an oar.\nAnyhow, she hadn't married a man with grown-up daughters.\n\n\"What ails Fanny?\" she asked me the next day. \"She looks like a froze\npullet.\"\n\n\"Where is she now?\"\n\n\"Making the beds.\"\n\nTemperance knew well what was the matter, but was too wise to\ninterfere. I found her, not bed-making, but in a spare room, staring\nat the wall. She looked at me with dry eyes, bit her lips, and folded\nher hands across her chest, after her old, defiant fashion. I did not\nspeak.\n\n\"It is so,\" she said; \"you need not tear me to pieces with your eyes,\nI can confess it to _you_, for you are as I am. I love him!\" And she\ngot up to shake her fist in my face. \"My heart and brain and soul are\nas good as hers, and _he_ knows it.\"\n\nI could not utter a word.\n\n\"I know him as you never knew him, and have for years, since I was\nthat starved, poor-house brat your mother took. Don't trouble yourself\nto make a speech about ingratitude. I know that your mother was good\nand merciful, and that I should have worshiped her; but I never did.\nDo you suppose I ever thought he was perfect, as the rest of you\nthought? He is full of faults. I thought he was dependant on me. He\nknows how I feel. Oh, what shall I do?\" She threw up her arms, and\ndropped on the floor in a hysteric fit. I locked the door, and picked\nher up. \"Come out of it, Fanny; I shall stay here till you do.\"\n\nBy dint of shaking her, and opening the window, she began to come to.\nAfter two or three fearful laughs and shudders, she opened her eyes.\nShe saw my compassion, and tears fell in torrents; I cried too. The\npoor girl kissed my hands; a new soul came into her face.\n\n\"Oh, Fanny, bear it as well as you can! You and I will be friends.\"\n\n\"Forgive me! I was always bad; I am now. If that woman comes here,\nI'll stab her with Manuel's knife.\"\n\n\"Pooh! The knife is too rusty; it would give her the lockjaw. Besides,\nshe will never come. I know her. She is already more than half-way to\nmeet me; but I shall not perform my part of the journey, and she will\nreturn.\"\n\n\"You don't say so!\" her ancient curiosity reviving.\n\n\"Manuel keeps it sharp,\" she said presently, relapsing into jealousy.\n\n\"You are a fool. Have you eaten anything to-day?\"\n\n\"I can't eat.\"\n\n\"That's the matter with you--an empty stomach is the cause of most\ndistressing pangs.\"\n\nBen urged me to go to Milford to meet Alice, and to ask her to come to\nour house. But father said no more to me on the subject. Neither did\nVeronica. In the afternoon they drove over to Milford, returning\nat dusk. She refused to come with them, Ben said, and never would\nprobably. \"You have thrown out your father terribly.\"\n\n\"You notice it, do you?\"\n\n\"It is pretty evident.\"\n\n\"What is your opinion?\"\n\nHe was about to condemn, when he recollected his own interference in\nmy life. \"Ah! you have me. I think you are right, as far as the past\nwhich relates to Alice is concerned. But if she chooses to forget,\nwhy don't you? We do much that is contrary to our moral ideas, to make\npeople comfortable. Besides, if we do not lay our ghosts, our closets\nwill be overcrowded.\"\n\n\"We may determine some things for ourselves, irrespective of\nconsequences.\"\n\n\"Well, there is a mess of it.\"\n\nFanny had watched for their return, counting on an access of misery,\nfor she believed that Alice would come also. It was what _she_ would\nhave done. Rage took possession of her when she saw father alone.\nShe planted herself before him, in my presence, in a contemptuous\nattitude. He changed color, and then her mood changed.\n\n\"What shall I do?\" she asked piteously.\n\nI tried to get away before she made any further progress; but\nhe checked me, dreading the scene which he foreboded, without\ncomprehending.\n\n\"Fanny,\" he said harshly, but with a confused face, \"you mistake me.\"\n\n\"Not I; it was your wife and children who mistook you.\"\n\n\"What is it you would say?\"\n\n\"You have let me be your slave.\"\n\n\"It is not true, I hope--what your behavior indicates?\"\n\nI forgave him everything then. Fanny had made a mistake. He had only\nbehaved very selfishly toward her, without having any perception of\nher--that was all! She was confounded, stared at him a moment, and\nrushed out. That interview settled her; she was a different girl from\nthat day.\n\n\"Father, you will go to Rosville, and be rich again. Can you buy this\nhouse from Ben, for me? A very small income will suffice me and Fanny,\nfor you may be sure that I shall keep her. Temperance will live with\nVerry; Ben will build, now that his share of his grandfather's estate\nwill come to him.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" he said with a sigh, \"I will bring it about.\"\n\n\"It is useless for us to disguise the fact--I have lost you. You are\nmore dead to me than mother is.\"\n\n\"You say so.\"\n\nIt was the truth. I was the only one of the family who never went\nto Rosville. Aunt Merce took up her abode with Alice, on account of\nArthur, whom she idolized. When father was married again, the Morgeson\nfamily denounced him for it, and for leaving Surrey; but they accepted\nhis invitations to Rosville, and returned with glowing accounts of his\nnew house and his hospitality.\n\nBy the next June, Ben's house was completed and they moved. Its site\nwas a knoll to the east of our house, which Veronica had chosen. Her\nrooms were toward the orchard, and Ben's commanded a view of the sea.\nHe had not ventured to intrude, he told her, upon the Northern Lights,\nand she must not bother him about his boat-house or his pier. They\nwere both delighted with the change, and kept house like children.\nTemperance indulged their whims to the utmost, though she thought\nBen's new-fangled notions were silly; but they might keep him from\n_something worse_. This something was a shadow which frightened me,\nthough I fought it off. I was weary of trouble, and shut my eyes as\nlong as possible. Whenever Ben went from home, and he often drove to\nMilford, or to some of the towns near, he came back disordered with\ndrink. At the sight my hopes would sink. But they rose again, he was\nso genial, so loving, so calmly contented afterward. As Verry never\nspoke of it either to Temperance or me, I imagined she was not\ntroubled much. She could not feel as I felt, for she knew nothing of\nthe Bellevue Pickersgill family history.\n\nThe day they moved was a happy one for me. I was at last left alone in\nmy own house, and I regained an absolute self-possession, and a sense\nof occupation I had long been a stranger to. My ownership oppressed\nme, almost, there was so much liberty to realize.\n\nI had an annoyance, soon after I came into sole possession. Father's\nbusiness was not yet settled, and he came to Surrey. He was paying his\ndebts in full, he told me, eking out what he lacked himself with the\nproperty of Alice. He could not have used much of it, however, for the\nvessels that were out at the time of the failure came home with good\ncargoes. I fancied that he had more than one regret while settling his\naffairs; that he missed the excitement and vicissitudes of a maritime\nbusiness. Nothing disagreeable arose between us, till I happened to\nask him what were the contents of a box which had arrived the day\nbefore.\n\n\"Something Alice sent you; shall we open it?\"\n\n\"I made no answer; but it was opened, and he took out a sea-green\nand white velvet carpet, with a scarlet leaf on it, and a piece of\nsea-green and white brocade for curtains. Had she sought the world\nover, she could have found nothing to suit me so well.\n\n\"She thought that Verry might have a fancy for some of the old\nfurniture, and that you would accept these in its place.\"\n\n\"There's nothing here to match this splendor, and I cannot bear to\nmake a change. Verry must have them, for she took nothing from me.\"\n\n\"Just as you please.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\n\n\"What a hot day!\" said Fanny. \"Every door and window is open. There is\nnot a breath of air.\"\n\n\"It will be calm all day,\" I said. \"We have two or three days like\nthis in a year. Give me another cup of coffee. Is it nine yet?\"\n\n\"Nearly. I ought to go to Hepsey's to-day. She wont be able to leave\nher bed, the heat weakens her so.\"\n\n\"Do go. How still it is! The shadows of the trees on the Neck reach\nalmost from shore to shore, and there's a fish-boat motionless.\"\n\n\"The boat was there when I got up.\"\n\n\"Everything is blue and yellow, or blue and white.\"\n\n\"How your hair waves this morning! It is handsomer than ever.\"\n\nI went to the glass with my cup of coffee. \"I look younger in the\nsummer.\"\n\n\"What's the use of looking younger here?\" she asked gruffly. \"You\nnever see a man.\"\n\n\"I see Ben coming with Verry, and Manuel behind.\"\n\n\"Hillo!\" cried Ben, pulling up his horses in front of the window. \"We\nare going on a picnic. Wont you go?\"\n\n\"How far?\"\n\n\"Fifteen or twenty miles.\"\n\n\"Go on; I had rather imprison the splendid day here.\"\n\n\"There's nothing for dinner,\" said Fanny.\n\n\"The fish-boat may come in, in time.\"\n\n\"Will three o'clock do for you? If so, I'll stay with Hepsey till\nthen.\"\n\n\"Four will answer?\"\n\nShe cleared away my breakfast things and left me. I sat by the window\nan hour, looking over the water, my thoughts drifting through a golden\nhaze, and then went up to my room and looked out again. If I turned my\neyes inside the walls, I was aware of the yearning, yawning empty void\nwithin me, which I did not like. I sauntered into Verry's room, to see\nif any clouds were coming up from the north. There were none. The sun\nhad transfixed the sky, and walked through its serene blue, \"burning\nwithout beams.\" Neither bird nor insect chirped; they were hid from\nthe radiant heat in tree and sod. I went back again to my own window.\nThe subtle beauty of these inorganic powers stirred me to mad regret\nand frantic longing. I stretched out my arms to embrace the presence\nwhich my senses evoked.\n\nIt would be better to get a book, I concluded, and hunted up Barry\nCornwall's songs. With it I would go to the parlor, which was shaded.\nI turned the leaves going down, and went in humming:\n\n\"Mount on the dolphin Pleasure,\" and threw myself on the sofa\nbeside--_Desmond_!\n\nI dropped Barry Cornwall.\n\n\"I have come,\" he said, in a voice deathly faint.\n\n\"How old you have grown, Desmond!\"\n\n\"But I have taken such pains with my hands for you! You said they were\nhandsome; are they?\"\n\nI kissed them.\n\nHe was so spare, and brown, and his hair was quite gray! Even his\nmustache looked silvery.\n\n\"Two years to-day since I have worn the watch, Desmond.\"\n\nHe took one exactly like it from his pocket, and showed me the\ninscription inside.\n\n\"And the ruby ring, on the guard?\"\n\n\"It is gone, you see; you must put one there now.\"\n\n\"Forgive me.\"\n\n\"Ah, Cassy! I couldn't come till now. You see what battles _I_ must\nhave had since I saw you. It took me so long to break my cursed\nhabits. I was afraid of myself, afraid to come; but I have tried\nmyself to the utmost, and hope I am worthy of you. Will you trust me?\"\n\n\"I am yours, as I always have been.\"\n\n\"I have eaten an immense quantity of oil and garlic,\" he said with a\nsigh. \"But Spain is a good place to reform in. How is Ben?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"Don't tell me anything sad now. Poor fellow! God help him.\"\n\nFanny was talking to some one on the walk; the fisherman probably, who\nwas bringing fish.\n\n\"Do you want some dinner?\"\n\n\"I have had no breakfast.\"\n\n\"I must see about something for you.\"\n\n\"Not to leave me, Cassy.\"\n\n\"Just for a few minutes.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But I want to cry by myself, besides looking after the dinner.\"\n\n\"Cry here then, with me. Come, Cassandra, my wife! My God, I shall die\nwith happiness.\"\n\nA mortal paleness overspread his face.\n\n\"Desmond, Desmond, do you know how I love you? Feel my heart,--it has\nthrobbed with the weight of you since that night in Belem, when you\nstruck your head under the mantel.\"\n\nHe was speechless. I murmured loving words to him, till he drew a deep\nbreath of life and strength.\n\n\"These fish are small,\" said Fanny at the door. \"Shall I take them!\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Desmond, \"I'll pay for them.\"\n\n\"It is Ben in black lead,\" said Fanny.\n\nWe laughed.\n\nAt dusk Ben and Veronica drove up. Desmond was seated in the window.\nBen fixed his eyes upon him, without stopping.\n\nWe ran out, and called to him.\n\n\"Old fellow,\" said Desmond, \"willing or not, I have come.\"\n\nBen's face was a study; so many emotions assailed him that my heart\nwas wrung with pity.\n\n\"Give her to me,\" Desmond continued in a touching voice. \"You are her\noldest friend, and have a right.\"\n\n\"She was always yours,\" he answered. \"To contend with her was folly.\"\n\nVeronica took hold of Ben's chin and raised his head to look into his\nface. \"What dreams have you had?\"\n\nBut he made no reply to her. We were all silent for a moment, then he\nsaid, \"Was I wrong, Des.?\"\n\n\"No, no.\"\n\nWhile, I was saying to myself, in behalf of Veronica, whose calm face\nbaffled me, \"Enigma, Sphinx\"; she turned to Desmond, holding out her\nright arm, and said, \"You are the man I saw in my dream.\"\n\n\"And you are like the Virgin I made an offering to, only not quite so\nbedizened.\" He took her extended hand and kissed it.\n\nBen threw the reins with a sudden dash toward Manuel, who was standing\nby, and jumped down.\n\n\"Have tea with me,\" I asked, \"and music, too. Verry, will you play for\nDesmond?\"\n\nShe took his arm, and entered the house.\n\n\"Friend,\" I said to Ben, who lingered by the door, \"to contend with me\nwas not folly, unless it has kept you from contending with yourself.\nTell me--how is it with you?\"\n\n\"Cassandra, the jaws of hell are open. If you are satisfied with the\nend, I must be.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter I was married, I went to Belem. But Mrs. Somers never forgave\nme; and Mr. Somers liked Desmond no better than he had in former\ntimes. Neither did Adelaide and Ann ever consider the marriage in any\nlight but that of a misalliance. Nor did they recognize any change\nin him. It might be permanent, but it was no less an aberration which\nthey mistrusted. The ground plan of the Bellevue Pickersgill character\ncould not be altered.\n\nIn a short time after we were married we went to Europe and stayed two\nyears.\n\nThese last words I write in the summer time at our house in Surrey,\nfor Desmond likes to be here at this season, and I write in my old\nchamber. Before its windows rolls the blue summer sea. Its beauty\nwears a relentless aspect to me now; its eternal monotone expresses no\npity, no compassion.\n\nVeronica is lying on the floor watching her year-old baby. It smiles\ncontinually, but never cries, never moves, except when it is moved.\nHer face, thin and melancholy, is still calm and lovely. But her\neyes go no more in quest of something beyond. A wall of darkness lies\nbefore her, which she will not penetrate. Aunt Merce sits near me with\nher knitting. When I look at her I think how long it is since mother\nwent, and wonder whether death is not a welcome idea to those who\nhave died. Aunt Merce looks at Verry and the child with a sorrowful\ncountenance, exchanges a glance with me, shakes her head. If Verry\nspeaks to her, she answers cheerfully, and tries to conceal the grief\nwhich she feels when she sees the mother and child together.\n\nBen has been dead six months.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\nhttp:\/\/gutenberg.net\/etext06\n\n    (Or \/etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/0\/2\/3\/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/2\/4\/6\/8\/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n","id":530,"split":"train"}
